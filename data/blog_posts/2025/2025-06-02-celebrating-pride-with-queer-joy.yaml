              <h2>James Beck (any/all)</h2>
              <p>Hello! My name is James Beck (any/all) and I’m a Paizo freelancer, infinite master on Pathfinder Infinite, co-founder of Eldritch Osiris Games, and all-around a geeky person! I know times are particularly tough around the world, especially for those who identify as LGBTQ+, but queer people have always existed and will always exist. I truly believe in a future where everyone can be who they wish to be. Something that I love about Pathfinder and Starfinder is how diverse the people of the setting are. I can always find someone whom I can identify with, which always fills me with joy. As Jews, we are taught about the value of Tikun Olam, to repair the world. While I might not be able to cast a spell and make everything right in the world, I believe we must all strive for a better tomorrow, where everyone is safe to be who they are. With much love - James Beck</p>
              <p><br></p>
              <h2>Rigby Bendele (they/them)</h2>
              <p>Hey, you. Yeah, you in the corner thinking about what it means to be queer in 2025. You, thinking about if it's worthwhile to come out. I'm here to say: yes, it is. Living my life openly and unabashedly as a trans person makes it vibrant, joyful, and worth living. I spent too much time in the closet and too long detransitioned to say otherwise. It's beautiful, even if I find myself having to carefully manage my exposure to the news to handle my stress.</p>
              <p>For those of you who are allies, especially cis allies of trans people: I'm not going to chide you or berate you. I've seen too many people want to be lectured for failing to live up to their values. That's for you to manage. Instead, I want you to celebrate with trans people. Give the flowers to the trans people in your life now. Understand that being part of our joy is part of helping us survive. I don't want anyone to look at my work and think that reading it is like taking a gross medicine to help counter transphobia. It's supposed to be fun!</p>
              <p>When I sit down and design games for you (yes, you, the person reading this!), I think of it as a gift. I'm trying to make the game work as smoothly as possible for you, with as many delightful surprises as I can fit onto the page, and open up an experience that we share across time and space. I can only tell the stories that I can tell. I hope that it's an invitation to understand a bit more about the world, or to explore something you haven't explored before. Even if you don't know me (especially if you don't know me!), my work is an attempt to say "Hello, let's play a game together." I hope that you have fun.</p>

              <h2>Carlos Cabrera (he/they)</h2>
              <p>It is so important right now to stand up for who you are and to protect the ones you love, and if that means just standing in the middle between the people that make you feel safe, that’s okay too.</p>
              <p>I have the fortune to share my life right now with multiple partners. One of them is gay, one of them intersex, and one of them trans (all shared with permission). I don’t see any of them as often as I would like, but I would still stand for each of them if any one of them were feeling threatened.</p>
              <p>I hope you do too, but I’ll stand for you as well if you don’t have the spoons.</p>

              <h2>Maya Coleman (xe/xem/they/them)</h2>
              <p>An avid musician and graduate from Oberlin College &amp; Conservatory with a degree in Film Music Composition, Maya has used their skills in organization in combination with a weaponization of their OCD and OCPD (literally) to flourish in the tabletop industry for nearly ten years. Starting as the sole employee at Goat, Wolf, &amp; Cabbage LLC, managing community for the board game Secret Hitler since its inception, they’ve gone on to manage communities at Skybound Tabletop, run projects on Kickstarter such as Trogdor!! The Board Game! and Trial by Trolley, and are now the Community and Social Media manager here at Paizo.</p>
              <p>When they are not working in the industry, Maya is an avid crafter and gamer. Their plushie collection is vast, from sweaters for their loyal service dog, Avalon, to d20, like from their panel at PaizoCon, to enormous snowflakes and Hatsune Miku! They’re also a huge fan of Pokemon, and, despite never having finished a single game, they’ve played each one released (their favorite pokemon is Gardevoir, by the way)! Maya is also your go-to resource for obscure film and soundtracks, and is happy to geek out about either at any given time!</p>

              <h2>Hiromi Cota (they/she)</h2>
              <p>This Pride, I’m proud of a variety of things, but I’ll narrow down to just two. Firstly, I recently celebrated my peoples’ (Indigenous Okinawan &amp; Yaeyaman) cultures by getting hajichi, traditional hand tattoos. They are traditionally women’s tattoos, usually done in stages to mark important milestones toward adulthood. They were also legally banned when Japan colonized our islands. But, as a trans femme and nonbinary person, me getting hajichi isn’t just a celebration of my Indigenous heritages or a rejection of Imperial Japan’s colonizer anti-tattoo laws; it’s also a celebration of my femininity and a visible assertion of my status as a femme Uchinaanchu &amp; Yaimapitu.</p>
              <p>Secondly, I’m so happy that I’ve been performing in shows as a femme performer. I’m an actor-combatant who regularly acts and fights in large shows at Renaissance Faires. And, a year ago, I switched from playing masculine characters to femme ones. It has been thrilling to show large, cheering crowds who I am.</p>
              <p>Happy Pride!</p>
              <p><br></p>
              <h2>Rue Dickey (they/he/xe)</h2>
              <p>Pride holds more meaning for me this year than it has in years prior, given the circumstances in the US and beyond. As systems work to erase hundreds of years of trans history and queer culture, it falls to us to hold those memories and stories within us. By sharing our stories, playing games, building worlds, and imagining futures where trans joy is a staple, not an exception, we lay the foundation for a better world—not only for those of us here now, but for the queer and trans people who follow after.</p>
              <p>My great joy on a yearly basis now is running TTRPGs for Trans Rights, an itch.io-based fundraiser that benefits trans-focused charities in hard-hit states (Texas, Florida, West Virginia, and Ohio have all been recipients). As one trans person, there’s only so much financial help I can provide, but with the power of community organizing, we can make huge strides! This year’s fundraiser pulled in over $80,000 for TransOhio and Kaleidoscope Youth Center, putting our organization’s total over the $1 million mark, and giving those organizations a much-needed funding boost to continue their important work. Organizations we’ve supported in the past like Latina Trans Texas and Transinclusive Group (Florida) still make use of the funds raised via our program, or programs and infrastructure built using those funds. From an idea in my living room, we built a grassroots fundraising initiative that is making life-changing amounts of money for queer organizations.</p>
              <p>Beyond the fundraising, it’s also important for me to show queer and trans people in those hard-hit states that they do have community. People care about you and want to see you thrive, even if you don’t get that kind of support locally. And knowing that there is a world out there that loves you as you are is life-saving.</p>
              <p><em>Rue Dickey is Paizo’s Marketing &amp; Media Specialist, as well as a freelance tabletop game designer, author, editor, and cultural consultant. Their independent work is driven by a desire to see more queer joy, rage, and power on the world stage.</em></p>
              <p><br></p>
              <h2>James Jacobs (he/him)</h2>
              <p>I’ve never been a big fan of parties or conventions or parades or other big social gatherings, and that includes things like organized protests and the like—I just get really awkward and uncomfortable when I’m around a lot of people. I know I’m not the only one with this little quirk, but for those out there who are leading the charge in more obvious and wide-reaching forms of resistance by spreading love and acceptance, thank you. That said, there’s still lots of ways to use stories of queer love, joy, and celebration to protest against oppression, even if in the grand scheme they’re pretty subtle. LBGTQ+ representation in Paizo’s Adventure Paths is one of the ways I’ve been working to share this joy—it was a very deliberate choice in the very first Pathfinder Adventure Path I wrote, “Burnt Offerings,” to include Jasper Korvaski as a local paladin who also happens to be gay, to put into print in the first volume proof that alignment is irrelevant to the discussion. Since then, we’ve included SO many more stories of queer joy and I’m proud of them all. A lot of them are much higher profile than one relatively minor paladin in a small town on the Lost Coast, but even these small stories are important ways to spread love and acceptance. So… thank you to all the amazing writers and developers and designers and editors and artists and more who’ve helped keep Paizo’s games filled with characters and stories that I’m immensely proud to have been a part of all this time!</p>

              <h2>Lynne M. Meyer (she/they)</h2>
              <p>Lin Codega’s article “Playing Games Amidst the Revolution” echoes in the back of my mind a lot these days. I’m a fifty-something queer, chronically ill, invisibly disabled, autistic femme; everything is just so much, the weight of the world so heavy, that some days, simply getting out of bed is a victory. Joy does not come easily.</p>
              <p>But queer joy&nbsp;<em>matters</em>. It’s how we survive. So I seek joy, do my best to cultivate it, and try to help spread it wherever I can. Games are part of how I do that. My most recent game (which I proudly included in the recent TTRPGs for Trans Rights bundle on itch.io) takes its inspiration from queer history—the tea dance, a non-alcoholic, queer event when same-gender dancing was illegal at venues selling alcohol. The tea dance was defiance wrapped in community and joy.</p>
              <p>Dan Savage, reflecting on the worst days of the AIDS crisis, talked about going from burying friends in the morning, to protesting in the afternoon, and then out dancing at night. “The dance kept us in the fight because it was the dance we were fighting for,” he explained. “It didn’t look like we were going to win then and we did. It doesn’t feel like we’re going to win now but we could. Keep fighting, keep dancing.”</p>
              <p>I would add:&nbsp;<em>keep playing</em>. Tell your stories, imagine better worlds, laugh with your friends around the gaming table—and know that you’re not alone.</p>

              <p>It’s 2012. I live in Texas. My partner lives in Washington. I propose at the Seattle Waterfront. They say yes and we share a pack of McDonald’s french fries and a Coke to celebrate. Queer love tastes like salt and carbonation and sea spray.</p>
              <p>We get married in 2014, before it’s federally legal. We arrive back in Texas, wearing wedding rings and calling each other wife. We lose our few state benefits due to discrimination.</p>
              <p>We transition in 2016. We look funny, we dress funny, we don’t fit the gender norms. We’re yelled at on the sidewalk outside of the one GAC clinic in Texas.</p>
              <p>We don’t care. Queer love tastes like fries and carbonation and sea spray. Queer strength feels like freedom and shoulders back and arms that hold and love you forever.</p>

              <h2>Kendra Leigh Speedling (she/her)</h2>
              <p>Hello, all! I’m Kendra Leigh Speedling, queer writer and frequent contributor to Paizo. Some of my recent work includes the Cobyslarni section in&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder Rival Academies</em>,&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #209: Destroyer’s Doom</em>, and the Verces section and space pirate archetype from Starfinder Second Edition’s first published book,&nbsp;<em>Starfinder Galaxy Guide</em>!</p>
              <p>Over the years, RPGs have helped me explore my own identity, and being a part of the queer Paizo community has been a big part of that. With every casual reference to a queer relationship in an adventure, every trans NPC, and every post of the “make it gayer” meme in a Paizo project server, I’m reminded that there a lot of us out there, and we’re not going anywhere. If someone picks up a book with a queer character I made and feels that sense of recognition or belonging, I’ll be proud of that. Pride is a riot—and we’ll need that spirit now more than ever—but Pride is also a party, because who we are is worth celebrating.</p>

              <h2>Alex Speidel (he/him)</h2>
              <p>This is not a hypothetical story.</p>
              <p>There is a game store. It’s on the outskirts of a midsize city. It’s the passion project of its owner, and it’s probably just barely staying afloat, but that’s not what we’re focused on right now.</p>
              <p>The game store is small, cluttered, does a roaring trade in trading cards, but one night a week, it hosts roleplaying games. Like most game stores, its clientele skews toward cis white dudes. But gaming is for everybody, and the player base has expanded.</p>
              <p>The thing is, this game store, this midsize city? Politically, they are not in a great place for people who are not cis white dudes. Conservative, in whatever flavor fits the locale. And so you’d think there wouldn’t be any queer people there, because why would there be?</p>
              <p>But you’d be wrong. Because we’re everywhere. We’re in that town. We’re in that store. And most of the time, you wouldn’t even know we’re there.</p>
              <p>But every once in a while, you would. Because a Pathfinder scenario asks you to help an NPC get their hands on a&nbsp;<em>serum of sex shift</em>. Or a Starfinder scenario casually has no binary NPCs and a whole host of agender and nonbinary characters using neopronouns. And that queer person? That kid, that teen, that adult who’s just figuring themselves out? They light up. They feel seen, they feel understood, they feel&nbsp;<em>joy</em>, for just a few minutes.</p>
              <p>This is a story I’ve heard dozens of times. Every time I do, it stokes the flame in my heart just a little bit, and reminds me why I do this.</p>
              <p>Because I know, every time I hear this story, that the worst people in the world are absolutely frothing mad about it. They are so incensed at the idea of queer joy that they will whip themselves into a frenzy, destroy their lives and livelihoods in a futile effort to snuff out that joy, go roaring into the dustbin of history with nothing to show for it.</p>
              <p>And we’ll just laugh and keep on. Because if the worst people in the world are mad at you, I think you’re doing just fine.</p>
              <p><br></p>
              <p><br></p>
              <p>Paizo is proud to have brought queer stories to our tables since the beginning, and we look forward to the wonderful stories our contributors will continue to tell! We welcome our community to share their queer joy and hope in the comments as well. Happy pride!</p>
