  \ and the second half of the <a href=\"/store/starfinder/adventurePath/deadSuns\"\
  >Dead Suns Adventure Path</a>, it seems like a good time to update folks on what\
  \ to expect from the Starfinder Adventure Path in the near future. Since the release\
  \ of the <em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em> last year, one thing we've heard over\
  \ and over is that people want more Starfinder! To that end, starting in August\
  \ 2018, the Starfinder Adventure Path goes monthly! That means a new adventure will\
  \ be available every month, and you'll get at least two full Starfinder campaigns\
  \ every year.</p> \n    <p>But that's not all! Also in August 2018, the second Starfinder\
  \ Adventure Path will present a complete Starfinder campaign in just three volumes,\
  \ followed by another three-volume Adventure Path in November. Not only will this\
  \ make for shorter, and hopefully more manageable, campaigns, but it will also enable\
  \ us to experiment even more with the traditional Adventure Path format going forward.\
  \ This isn't the end of the six-volume Adventure Path, however. We'll be returning\
  \ to that length in 2019, and our plan is to release new Starfinder Adventure Paths\
  \ in both three-volume and six-volume formats in the futureâ€”whichever works best\
  \ for the stories we want to tell.</p> \n    <p>Whether it's three volumes or six,\
  \ the Starfinder Adventure Path will still have all of the same content you've come\
  \ to expect. In addition to the adventures themselves, each volume features additional\
  \ articles that provide more detail on the Starfinder campaign setting and present\
  \ new options for players, as well as new alien creatures in the Alien Archives,\
  \ a new planet to explore in the Codex of Worlds, and a new starship in every installment.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>So what can you expect from our first monthly, three-volume Starfinder\
  \ Adventure Path, debuting in August? It's the <a href=\"/store/starfinder/adventurePath/againstTheAeonThrone\"\
  >Against the Aeon Throne Adventure Path</a>, which pits the heroes against the might\
  \ of the tyrannical Azlanti Star Empire! To succeed, the heroes must liberate a\
  \ Pact Worlds colony in the Vast from Azlanti occupation and infiltrate the Star\
  \ Empire to rescue captive Pact Worlders from imprisonment. At the same time, the\
  \ heroes will need to prevent the Azlanti from getting their hands on an experimental\
  \ piece of technology that could shift the balance of power in the galaxy!</p> \n\
  \    <p>The first Against the Aeon Throne adventure, <a href=\"/products/btpy9y25?Starfinder-Adventure-Path-The-Reach-of-Empire\"\
  >\"The Reach of Empire,\"</a> hits store shelves and paizo.com in August, followed\
  \ by a new volume every month. Do your heroes have what it takes go Against the\
  \ Aeon Throne?</p> \n    <p>Robert G. McCreary<br> <i>Creative Director</i></p>\
