  \ next few weeks leading up to Halloween on some of the spookier figures in the\
  \ upcoming <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/shatteredStar\">Shattered Star</a>\
  \ set of Pathfinder Battles prepainted miniatures, but this week our doorbell rang\
  \ here at Paizo, and our partners at WizKids delivered one of the greatest pre-Halloween\
  \ treats of all in the form of the final paint master of the Gargantuan Blue Dragon,\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy8v08\">the special \"case incentive\" promotional figure</a>\
  \ for the set.</span></p> \n     <p>Here she is, in all her magic-item-bedecked\
  \ glory, shown here with regular-sized Seoni the sorceress for size-comparison purposes:</p>\

  0\"></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>What you see before you is the mighty Cadrilkasta,\
  \ a wyrm blue dragon that serves as the primary nemesis of the campaign's fifth\
  \ installment, <a href=\"/products/btpy8tdh\"><i>\"Into the Nightmare Rift\"</i></a>.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Cadrilkasta has long haunted the skies of Varisia, scanning the countryside\
  \ for signs of ancient Thassilonian ruins. So obsessed with the Runelords is Cadrilkasta\
  \ that she has carved their runes into her chest, as shown in this close-up image.</p>\
  \ \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/Secondary/WizKids/WZK70992-Secondary2_500.jpeg\"\

  0\"></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>In the Shattered Star Adventure Path, Cadrilkasta\
  \ is encountered digging up an ancient Thassilonian ruin looking for a powerful\
  \ magical artifact. Since the PCs will likely have several shards of the potent\
  \ artifact that serves as the basis of the campaign by the time they meet her, it's\
  \ probably safe to say that she will be just as interested in them as they are in\
  \ her.</p> \n     <p>When you plop this giant figure down on the table, it'll make\
  \ an encounter your player characters won't soon forget! We're still trying to straighten\
  \ out Seoni, and she only just met the dragon yesterday!</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  0\"></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>As a case incentive, the <a href=\"/products/btpy8v08\"\
  >Gargantuan Blue Dragon</a> is available for purchase only to customers who preorder\
  \ a <a href=\"/products/btpy8v0b\">Shattered Star Standard Booster Case</a> and\
  \ to ongoing <a href=\"/products/btpy8o6b\">Pathfinder Battles case subscribers</a>.\
  \ The figure has been produced in extremely limited quantities, so order soon to\
  \ make sure that you do not miss out!</p> \n     <p>Before I go, I wanted to take\
  \ a moment to talk about dragons in general, and the philosophy of how we decide\
  \ which figures to include in Pathfinder Battles sets. The Gargantuan Blue is our\
  \ first Gargantuan dragon, but it definitely won't be our last. When news about\
  \ this figure first leaked on the internet earlier this week, some long-time miniatures\
  \ collectors expressed a bit of disappointment, because they've long wanted a Gargantuan\
  \ Green Dragon, which has not been produced to date by any prepainted miniature\
  \ company. As a longtime collector of prepainted miniatures, I assure you that I\
  \ also want a Gargantuan Green Dragon, and am working hard to include one in an\
  \ upcoming set.</p> \n     <p>Cadrilkasta is an important dragon in the Shattered\
  \ Star Adventure Path. Since this set is designed to support that campaign, the\
  \ blue dragon made for a logical choice as the case incentive miniature. Based on\
  \ an incredible Wayne Reynolds painting and sculpted with amazing detail by WizKids,\
  \ we're confident that this is a super-cool dragon that you will be glad to have\
  \ in your collection, even if you've already got a giant blue dragon in it from\
  \ a few years back.</p> \n     <p>It's our intention to do every \"true\" dragon\
  \ in every size category, Small, Medium, Large, Huge, and Gargantuan. We plan to\
  \ be producing prepainted miniatures for years and years, and I'm confident that\
  \ we'll get to all of them eventually (some, like the green, probably sooner than\
  \ later). But when a set is made to support an existing Adventure Path, as many\
  \ of our sets will be, it's going to provide the dragons appropriate for that campaign.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>For Shattered Star, that means a Gargantuan Blue. But I assure you,\
  \ the rest of them are coming!</p> \n     <p>That's it for this week (and what a\
  \ week it's been!). Check back next week for a return to the originally intended\
  \ spooooooky theme. I've got some stuff that will scare you out of your socks!</p>\
