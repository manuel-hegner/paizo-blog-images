  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Today is the day! <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/pathfinder\">Pathfinder Second Edition</a> is officially here,\
  \ on store shelves, at online retailers, and soon on game tables all across the\
  \ world. It’s been more than three years since we first started work in earnest\
  \ on the new edition, and after all that time—and with the assistance of tens of\
  \ thousands of playtesters—Pathfinder Second Edition is ready for action!</p> \n\
  \     <p>With your help, we’ve developed the familiar Pathfinder rules to make them\
  \ easier to learn and faster to play without sacrificing the deep character customization\
  \ that has always been one of Pathfinder’s strongest elements. If anything, Pathfinder\
  \ Second Edition gives players more opportunities to customize their heroes than\
  \ ever before. GMs will find more tools for creating dynamic and interesting encounters\
  \ baked right into the core rules, and even the most familiar monsters of the fantasy\
  \ genre have new abilities sure to interest even the most experienced RPG veterans.</p>\
  \ \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/080119-innersea.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/080119-innersea_500.jpeg\"\
  \ alt=\"The Inner Sea.\"></a>\n     </div> \n     <h2>The Core Rules</h2> \n   \
  \  <p>Everything starts with the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01y0k?Pathfinder-Core-Rulebook\"\
  >Pathfinder Core Rulebook</a>, 640 pages of rules covering character creation, encounters,\
  \ exploration, treasure, magic, and more: everything players and GMs need to play\
  \ and run the new game. With 12 character classes, dozens of backgrounds, and fully\
  \ developed ancestries including halfling, human, elf, dwarf, gnome, and goblin,\
  \ players have a near-limitless combination of choices that give even characters\
  \ with the same class and ancestry a unique gameplay experience.</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01y0m?Pathfinder-Bestiary\">Pathfinder\
  \ Bestiary</a> presents game statistics and adventure-inspiring lore for more than\
  \ 400 creatures. Packed with all-new art and completely redesigned monsters, the\
  \ Bestiary presents an entirely new stat block format designed to speed up play,\
  \ as well as tons of imaginative new attacks and abilities that take full advantage\
  \ of Pathfinder Second Edition’s overhauled rules.</p> \n     <h2>Adventures</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>A new edition is a great opportunity to start a new campaign, and the\
  \ first monthly installment of the Age of Ashes Adventure Path launches today. <a\
  \ href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01y0p?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-Hellknight-Hill\"\
  >Pathfinder Adventure Path #145: Hellknight Hill</a> kicks off the new campaign\
  \ in style when strange invaders spill out from an abandoned Hellknight fortress\
  \ near the heroes’ home village. Secrets uncovered during an exploration of the\
  \ ruins lead the party all over the world and threaten to unleash an age of draconic\
  \ tyranny and terror that only the heroes can prevent!</p> \n     <p><a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/products/btq01y0q?Pathfinder-Adventure-The-Fall-of-Plaguestone\"\
  >Pathfinder Adventures: The Fall of Plaguestone</a> is a 64-page stand-alone adventure\
  \ for first-level characters designed to tell the story of how your adventuring\
  \ party first met and became companions. A short job as caravan guards gets much\
  \ more complicated when the caravan master is poisoned, and the heroes are forced\
  \ to solve the murder—or hang for it! The <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01y0r?Pathfinder-FlipMat-The-Fall-of-Plaguestone\"\
  >Pathfinder Flip-Mat: Fall of Plaguestone</a> sets the scene with key encounter\
  \ areas ready for use with miniatures, helping GMs pull players even further into\
  \ the fantasy.</p> \n     <p>If you’re looking for a single-session adventure to\
  \ give the new rules a spin, Paizo’s <a href=\"https://paizo.com/pathfinderSociety\"\
  >Pathfinder Society Organized Play</a> program has four Pathfinder Society Scenarios\
  \ available for download now. In <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01znb?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-101-The-Absalom-Initiation\"\
  >The Absalom Initiation</a>, the heroes join up as the newest Pathfinder Society\
  \ agents, rubbing shoulders with veterans and embarking on their new adventuring\
  \ careers. <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01znc?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-102-The-Mosquito-Witch\"\
  >The Mosquito Witch</a> puts the heroes on the trail of a mysterious cryptid in\
  \ the swamps of the cutthroat River Kingdoms. In the perilous ruins of Lastwall,\
  \ where the undead armies of the Whispering Tyrant prowl a ravaged wasteland, Pathfinder\
  \ Society agents race against time to save priceless artifacts and missing-in-action\
  \ colleagues in <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01znd?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-103-Escaping-the-Grave\"\
  >Escaping the Grave</a>. With a running time of about 1 hour, <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01zne?Pathfinder-Society-Quest-1A-The-Sandstone-Secret\"\
  >The Sandstone Secret</a> presents a fast and furious dungeon crawl and a fun first\
  \ look at the Pathfinder rules.</p> \n     <p>Pathfinder Society also provides a\
  \ set of <a href=\"/products/btq01zt5?Community-Use-Package-PF2E-Iconics-Pregenerated-Characters\"\
  >pregenerated characters</a> that allow you to skip character creation and jump\
  \ right into the action. A fifth Pathfinder Society Scenario, <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01zna?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-100-Origin-of-the-Open-Road\"\
  >Origin of the Open Road</a>, delves into the history of the Pathfinder Society\
  \ over the course of a thrilling 5th-level adventure designed specifically for use\
  \ with pregenerated characters.</p> \n     <h2>Accessories</h2> Pathfinder Second\
  \ Edition Launch Day also brings several new accessories you’ll want to check out.\
  \ The <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01y0s?Pathfinder-Character-Sheet-Pack\"\
