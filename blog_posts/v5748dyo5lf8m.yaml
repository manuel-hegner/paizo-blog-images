  \ itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">Just a few weeks\
  \ ago, we announced the <i>Pathfinder RPG Advanced Class Guide</i>, an exciting\
  \ new addition to the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game due out next summer. While we\
  \ talked about it a fair bit at Gencon, this blog post is here to get you caught\
  \ up on all the news!</span></p> \n    <p>This 256-page rulebook will contain 10\
  \ new classes, each a mix of two existing classes, taking a bit from each class\
  \ and adding new mechanics to give you a unique character. Around the office we're\
  \ calling them \"hybrid classes.\" You can think of the magus (from <i>Ultimate\
  \ Magic</i>) as our first test of this concept. It takes some rules from the fighter,\
  \ some rules from the wizard, and then adds its own unique mechanics. </p> \n  \
  \  <p>At this point, you're probably wondering what new classes you can expect to\
  \ see in the <i>Advanced Class Guide</i>. So far, we've announced five of the ten\
  \ classes.</p> \n    <p><b>Bloodrager</b>: This blend of sorcerer and barbarian\
  \ can call upon the power of his blood whenever he goes into a rage. He also has\
  \ a limited selection of spells he can call upon, even when in a mindless fury!</p>\
  \ \n    <p><b>Hunter</b>: Taking powers from both the druid and the ranger, the\
  \ hunter is never without her trusted animal companion, hunting down foes with lethal\
  \ accuracy.</p> \n    <p><b>Shaman</b>: Calling upon the spirits to aid her, the\
  \ shaman draws upon class features of the oracle and the witch. Each day, she can\
  \ commune with different spirits to aid her and her allies.</p> \n    <p><b>Slayer</b>:\
  \ Look at all the blood! The slayer blends the rogue and the ranger to create a\
  \ character that is all about taking down particular targets.</p> \n    <p><b>Warpriest</b>:\
  \ Most religions have martial traditions, and warpriests are often the backbones\
  \ of such orders. This mix of cleric and fighter can call upon the blessings of\
  \ the gods to defeat enemies of their faiths.</p> \n    <p>Of course, those are\
  \ just half the classes in this book. There are four more we have yet to reveal.\
  \ </p> \n    <p>\"Four?\" you say. \"But I thought there were ten!\" And you would\
  \ be right—because I'm about to let you in on another of the classes that will appear\
  \ in this book, which we haven't announced until this moment!</p> \n    <p><b>Swashbuckler</b>:\
  \ Break out your rapier and your wit! The swashbuckler uses panache and daring to\
  \ get the job done, blending the powers of the fighter and the gunslinger! For those\
  \ of you who don't use guns in your campaign, fear not—the base class is not proficient\
  \ in firearms (although there will certainly be an archetype in the book that fix\
  \ that).</p> \n    <p>But that's not all! This book will also contain archetypes\
  \ for all 10 new classes, as well as a selection to help existing classes play with\
  \ some of the new features in this book. There will also be feats and spells to\
  \ support these new classes, as well as magic items that will undoubtedly become\
  \ favorites for nearly any character. Last but not least, the final chapter in this\
  \ book will give you a peek inside the design process for classes and archetypes,\
  \ giving you plenty of tips and guides to build your own! Since class design is\
  \ more art than science, this won't be a system (like in the <i>Advanced Race Guide</i>),\
  \ but rather a chapter giving you advice on how the process works.</p> \n    <p>So,\
  \ there you go. That's six of the 10 classes that will appear in the <i>Advanced\
  \ Class Guide</i> and an overview of what else you can expect from this exciting\
  \ new book. While it's due to release next August, you won't have to wait too long\
  \ to get your hands on these classes, because we're planning to do a public playtest\
  \ here this fall! Check back here for more news as the playtest draws close!</p>\
