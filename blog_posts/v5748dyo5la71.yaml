  date\">Thursday, May 17, 2007</p> Though he's too busy statting up Orcus and Iggwilv\
  \ for <i>Dungeon</i> 149 to make a post himself, <i>Pathfinder</i> Editor-in-Chief\
  \ James Jacobs thought you might be interested in a bit of Sandpoint lore he's been\
  \ working on for <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7xpr\">\"Burnt Offerings\"</a>:\n   <p></p>\
  \ \n   <blockquote> \n    <p><i>When Jervis Stoot made clear his intentions to build\
  \ a home on the island just north of the Old Light, locals paid him no mind. Jervis\
  \ had already garnered something of a reputation as an eccentric for his one-man\
  \ crusade to carve depictions of birds on every deserving building in town. Stoot\
  \ never made a carving without securing permission, but his incredible skill made\
  \ it a given that if Stoot picked your building as the site of his latest project,\
  \ you seized the opportunity. Sporting a Stoot soon grew to be something of a bragging\
  \ point, and Jervis eventually extended his talent to include ship figureheads and\
  \ even carriages. Those who asked or tried to pay him for his skill were rebuffed,\
  \ Stoot telling them, \"There ain't no birds in that wood for me t'set free,\" and\
  \ going on his way. Stoot often wandering the streets for days before noticing a\
  \ hidden bird in a fencepost, lintel, steeple, or doorframe and securing permission\
  \ to \"release\" it with his trusty carving knives.</i></p> \n    <p><i>Stoot's\
  \ excuse for wanting to move to the isle seemed innocent enoughâ€”the place was a\
  \ haven for local birdlife, and his claim of \"Wantin' ta be with th' birds\" seemed\
  \ to make sense. So much, in fact, that the guild of Carpenters (with whom Stoot\
  \ had maintained a friendly competition for several years) volunteered to build\
  \ a staircase, free of charge, along the southern cliff face so that Stoot could\
  \ come and go from his new home with ease. For fifteen years, Stoot lived on the\
  \ island. His trips into town grew less and less frequent, making it something of\
  \ an event when he chose a building to host a new Stoot.</i></p> \n    <p><i>Sandpoint\
  \ was no stranger to crime, or even to murder. Once or twice a year, passions flared,\
  \ robberies went bad, jealousy grew too much to bear, or one-too-many drinks were\
  \ drunk, and someone would end up dead. But when body count suddenly began to mount,\
  \ the town had no idea how to react. Sandpoint's sheriff at the time was a no-nonsense\
  \ man named Casp Avertin, a retired city watch officer from Magnimar, yet even he\
  \ was ill-prepared for the murderer who came to be known as Chopper. Over the course\
  \ of one long winter month, every few days brought a new victim to light. Each was\
  \ found in the same terrible state, bodies bearing deep cutting wounds to the neck\
  \ and torso, with both hands and feet severed and stacked nearby and the eyes and\
  \ tongue missing entirely, plucked crudely from the head.</i></p> \n    <p><i>Over\
  \ the course of that terrible month, Chopper claimed 25 victims. His uncanny knack\
  \ at eluding traps and pursuit quickly wore on the town guard, taking particular\
  \ toll on Sheriff Avertin, who increasingly took to drinking. Many believe that\
  \ he even took to beating his wife and daughter, and that, in its own way, may have\
  \ been the genesis of the Sandpoint Fire. In any event, Sheriff Avertin himself\
  \ became Chopper's last victim, slain when he finally caught the killer mutilating\
  \ his latest victim in the side street that would come to be known as Chopper's\
  \ Alley. Yet in the battle that followed, Avertin managed a telling blow against\
  \ the murderer. When the town guard found the sheriff dead with another victim several\
  \ minutes later, they were able to follow the bloody trail left by the killer.</i></p>\
  \ \n    <p><i>A trail that led straight to the stairs of Stoot's Rock.</i></p> \n\
  \    <p><i>At first, the town guard refused to believe the implications, and feared\
  \ that Chopper had come to claim poor Jervis Stoot as his 26th victim. Yet what\
  \ the guards found in the modest home atop the isle, and in the larger complex of\
  \ rooms that had been carved into the bedrock below, left no room for doubt. Jervis\
  \ Stoot and Chopper were the same, and the eyes and tongues of all 25 victims were\
  \ found in a horrific altar to a birdlike demon whose name none dared speak aloud.\
  \ Stoot himself was found dead at the base of the altar, having plucked his own\
  \ eyes and tongue loose for a final offering. The guards collapsed the entrance\
  \ to the chambers, burned Stoot's house, tore down the stairs, and did their best\
  \ to forget. Stoot himself was burned on the beach in a pyre, his ashes then blessed\
  \ and then scattered in an attempt to stave off an unholy return of his evil spirit\
  \ from beyond the grave. And in the months to follow, Sandpoint did its best to\
  \ forget the terror, although even today, children who remember the dark times only\
  \ six years ago sometimes wake with nightmare visions of Chopper hiding under their\
  \ beds.</i></p> \n   </blockquote>\n  </blockquote> \n </div> <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog\"\
