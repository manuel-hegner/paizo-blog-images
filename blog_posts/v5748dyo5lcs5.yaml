  \ class=\"PTales\"></div></a> \n   <h1>Blood and Money</h1> \n   <p>by Steven Savile</p>\
  \ \n   <h2>Chapter One: Nightwalker</h2> \n   <p>It was well after midnight in the\
  \ garden. He was not alone. Aphids crept and crawled across his bare skin, and a\
  \ hot wind blew in from the desert. The unseasonal sirocco was an excuse for madness.\
  \ Men would use it as a rationale for particularly savage beatings, claiming the\
  \ wind had driven them to it. Isra had no patience for weak men or liars. He did,\
  \ however, appreciate the beauty of the well-tended garden.</p> \n   <p>The topiaries\
  \ of Hasim Rakhman's palace were legendary, all manner of fabulous beasts carved\
  \ out of the shrubbery to stand guard over the merchant’s equally legendary maze.\
  \ Isra stood in the shadow of a leonine predator. The scent of jasmine was thick\
  \ in the air, overpowering other, far subtler musks from the many more delicate\
  \ plants in the garden.</p> \n   <p>He hadn’t moved so much as a muscle for more\
  \ than a quarter of an hour. In the landscape of shadows, even the slightest movement,\
  \ a finger moving to scratch an itch, was exaggerated and could so easily betray\
  \ him. Despite the fact that Rakhman had a dozen men patrolling the gardens, none\
  \ of them had marked Isra’s presence—but then, he was good at what he did. Even\
  \ so, Isra was well aware that the longer he waited before making his move, the\
  \ greater the chance of him being discovered became. It wasn’t magic, just was simple\
  \ mathematics. Probability. He used the skill in his other life, when the sun was\
  \ up and the Nightwalker didn’t exist. It was the kind of thinking that had helped\
  \ make him rich.</p> \n   <p>But with the sickle of moon high in the sky, he was\
  \ very much the Nightwalker now, and his instruction had been clear: kill Hasim\
  \ Rakhman on this night. The client was very particular about the timing. It had\
  \ to be tonight. He would make sure Rakhman was vulnerable, and it was up to Isra\
  \ to exploit that weakness and get the job done.</p> \n   <p>And the reason his\
  \ client could assure him the principal would be vulnerable? He was captain of Rakhman’\
  s personal guard. The price of loyalty? About half a year’s salary. That and a shapely\
  \ woman eager for said guard captain to take her overweight husband’s place in bed.\
  \ Permanently.</p> \n   <p>It was always the same. No matter how complicated clients\
  \ believed their motives to be, they always came down to lust. Be it for money,\
  \ power, or sex, it was always about craving more.</p> \n   <p>But that didn’t explain\
  \ why there were so many guards in the grounds tonight. Sweat trickled down into\
  \ the bay at the nape of Isra’s neck. Still he did not move.</p> \n   <p>He hadn’\
  t stayed alive this long by walking blindly into traps, and this was some kind of\
  \ trap. He harbored no illusions about that. It would have been easy to slip away\
  \ into the night and leave them to whatever game it was they were playing, but he\
  \ had an obligation. The contract was open. He was the Nightwalker. He was the killer\
  \ who never failed to execute a contract. He breathed in deeply, savoring the heat\
  \ in his lungs. He could understand why the heat of the night drove men to thoughts\
  \ of passion and murder. People were simple creatures at the best of times. The\
  \ constant heat robbed them of the ability to think, reducing them to the most base\
  \ of instincts. It didn’t matter that they wouldn’t stain their hands with the blood,\
  \ they craved it just the same. Who was he to deny them? There would be blood tonight,\
  \ he promised himself.</p> \n   <p>He studied the marbled facade of Rakhman’s palace,\
  \ his eye drawn to the veranda that led into the merchant’s study, and caught a\
  \ glimpse of his employer, the regally handsome captain of Rakhman’s force pacing\
  \ back and forth within. He was huge, and more than capable of snapping a weasel\
  \ like Hasim Rakhman in two like a brittle twig—a corpulent, sweaty one, but a twig\
  \ all the same. But his hands had to be clean. That he was here rather than in some\
  \ public place making the kind of spectacle of himself that would ensure he had\
  \ an alibi only added to Isra’s sense of unease.</p> \n   <p>Again the thought of\
  \ simply slipping away into the darkness and leaving them to get on with whatever\
  \ petty little game they were playing at occurred to him, but again his damned professional\
  \ pride got in the way, killing the notion in a heartbeat. He had been paid to do\
  \ a job, and he would do it to the letter of the contract. And if it wasn’t what\
  \ his erstwhile paymaster wanted, well, it would serve him and his dead master right.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Hasim Rakhman came out onto the veranda, alone. He had a cup in his hand.\
  \ Isra could see the wraiths of steam curl up from the hot drink. The fact that\
  \ he was dressed rather than in some silk nightgown was another telling detail that\
  \ betrayed his trap. Rakhman wiped his brow with a large white handkerchief. The\
  \ temperature had dropped several degrees in the time Isra had taken up his vigil,\
  \ which meant that it was fear rather than heat that was causing the fat merchant\
  \ to sweat. And the longer Isra made him wait, the more jittery he was becoming.\
  \ It would have been a mercy to put him out of his misery, but the Nightwalker was\
  \ not in the business of mercy.</p> \n   <p>Isra broke away from his hiding place\
  \ and ghosted through shadows. So complete was his mastery of his own body that\
  \ he didn’t displace so much as a single leaf on any of the many plants and bushes\
  \ he crept past. Rakhman’s men continued their patrols, oblivious to his presence.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Isra was within six feet of the fat man when he decided to spring the\
  \ trap. Still it took Rakhman a moment to get through the shock of disbelief before\
  \ the alarm was raised.</p> \n   <p>“<i>Seize him</i>!” Hasim Rakhman cried, waving\
  \ his handkerchief above his head. Isra smiled coldly, enjoying the soon-to-be dead\
  \ man’s frantic signaling. He could flap about to his heart’s content. No amount\
  \ of it was going to save him. The guards were ready to slam shut the steel jaws\
  \ of their trap, but Isra only needed a second to close the gap.</p> \n   <p>The\
  \ captain of the guard rushed out of the study, sword drawn, but did nothing to\
  \ prevent his employer's death, so perhaps there was at least a grain of truth to\
  \ the lie Isra had been sold? The Nightwalker didn’t hesitate. He had his knife\
  \ out, already balanced in his hand. Hasim Rakhman screamed in panic, flapping about\
  \ all the more desperately now as he tried to protect his face, but left his stomach\
  \ wide open for the assassin’s curved blade. A single slice of the cruel knife quickly\
  \ stained the man's shirt red. His hands clutched at his stomach. He howled in pain.\
  \ The Nightwalker granted him one last scream before he drew a gash across his throat—\
  deep, from ear to ear—and silenced him once and for all.</p> \n   <p>With the deed\
  \ done, the captain chose his moment to close the gap between them, calling, “<i>To\
  \ me!</i>” as he did. In that moment Isra grasped just how many snares had been\
  \ set within that initial trap. The captain had never intended his master to survive\
  \ the night. The fat man had trusted him, and that had cost him his life. Isra did\
  \ not trust anyone.</p> \n   <p>“Time to make peace with your god, assassin,” the\
  \ captain rasped. His grin was every bit as cruel as Isra’s knife. His eyes darted\
  \ left, betraying the rush of the first of his guards. Isra dropped his shoulder\
  \ and thundered his elbow into the trachea of the man on his left. The guard went\
  \ down clutching his throat. Isra spun away from the captain, sweeping out his right\
  \ leg to dump the second running guard on his backside. He stamped on the man’s\
  \ face, driving his heel into his nose and rupturing it.</p> \n   <p>Isra gave the\
  \ fat man a final glance, to be absolutely sure that he was beyond saving, and launched\
  \ himself upward, using the great earthenware pot that housed a lemon tree to push\
  \ himself to within grasping distance of the balcony railings above. He swung his\
  \ legs up as the first sword sliced through the air, missing him by inches. The\
  \ lemon tree teetered, then toppled, the great pot shattering and the noise creating\
  \ the moment of confusion Isra had hoped for. The Nightwalker hauled himself up\
  \ over the balcony rail as the sword clattered against the marbled wall. He moved\
  \ quickly now, grasping the trailing vines that grew up around the balcony doors,\
  \ trusting them to hold his weight as he scaled the side of the palace. He risked\
  \ a glance down over his shoulder. The captain wasn’t about to give up his prey,\
  \ not when he needed someone to pay the metaphorical price of his master’s death.\
  \ He was stronger than Isra, but the assassin was more agile. In a fair fight the\
  \ assassin wouldn’t have stood a chance, but there was nothing fair about a moonlit\
  \ chase across the rooftops of Katapesh when death was on the line. </p> \n   <p>Isra\
  \ bounced on his toes and pushed upward again, reaching for the roof. He broke his\
  \ cardinal self-imposed rule of climbing by stretching a few inches beyond what\
  \ was comfortable. Off-balance, he worked his fingers into a crack in the masonry.\
  \ Isra swallowed the panic instinct, forcing himself to breathe evenly as he lifted\
  \ himself carefully upward, gradually taking all of his weight on three fingertips.\
  \ Then he drew his right leg up, keeping his body pressed flat to the marbled wall,\
  \ until his instep dragged over another crack, this one barely a wart across. Again,\
  \ it was just enough. Between fingertips and toes he had the leverage he needed\
  \ to boost himself up high enough to grab the gable. He slapped his right hand flat\
  \ on the clay tiles and for a sickening moment he hung there, forty feet above the\
  \ ground, clinging on by his fingertips. He kicked out, scrabbling for purchase\
  \ until the tarred sole of his shoe gripped something on the wall, and then he was\
  \ over the top and lying on his back looking up at the sickle-shaped moon.</p> \n\
  \   <p>He didn’t have time to catch his breath. Isra rolled over onto his stomach\
  \ and pushed himself up.</p> \n   <p>Had the captain been as thorough as Isra would\
  \ have in his place, the assassin would be dead now—he offered his silhouette to\
  \ the moon as he ran across the rooftops. All it would have taken was one well-placed\
  \ archer. But the captain wasn’t as good as Isra.</p> \n   <p>The assassin moved\
  \ fast, circling the domed roof. He was light and nimble, his trade relying on guile\
  \ and speed over brute force. The man following him was anything but. Isra noted\
  \ the grating slip and crash of tiles behind him with grim satisfaction as the captain\
  \ of the guard lost his balance. The captain’s sheer muscle mass made him far less\
  \ dexterous than the assassin, which was exactly what Isra was banking upon.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>With luck, the man would either fall, ending his pursuit the hard way,\
  \ or give it up the easy way. Either worked just fine for Isra—but then, given his\
  \ position, beggars could hardly be choosers.</p> \n   <p>He found what he was looking\
  \ for on the far side of the roof: the flag post flying Hasim Rakhman’s family standard.\
  \ He didn’t need to peer down over the edge. He knew his city well. The market lay\
  \ beyond the wall of Rakhman’s property with its mismatch of colorful tents all\
  \ squashed together. He smiled grimly, thanking Norgorber once more for looking\
  \ out for his favorite son. Miracles, in Isra’s experience, had no need to be any\
  \ more miraculous than a well-positioned flagpole in a time of great need. He had\
  \ practiced leaps like this a thousand and one times before. He started to run,\
  \ lengthening his stride to use gravity to the full, and launched himself off the\
  \ roof into the air, kicking out.</p> \n   <div class=\"blurb360\">\n    <a href=\"\

  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    <br> \"The Nightwalker always finishes the job.\"\n   </div>\
  \ \n   <p>It felt like flying, even though it only lasted for a heartbeat.</p> \n\
  \   <p>Isra snatched at the flagpole just below the trailing ropes of Rakhman's\
  \ fluttering standard. The assassin swung through a quarter-circle before releasing\
  \ his grip, completely changing the direction of his fall. As he came down fast,\
  \ he reached or his knife. The blade was still slick with the dead man’s blood.\
  \ Isra didn’t have time for the luxury of philosophy—the blade had taken one life\
  \ and was about to save another. That was just the way it went.</p> \n   <p>He hit\
  \ the silk roof of one of the trader’s pavilions hard, tumbling head over heels\
  \ as he bounced and slid from the roof of the tent. Moving instinctively, Isra stabbed\
  \ the blade into the fabric, using its resistance to arrest the speed of his fall.\
  \ It wasn’t so much that he allowed himself a glance back to the roof of Rakhman’\
  s home as the geometry of his fall afforded him one, but either way, the captain\
  \ of the guards was nowhere to be seen. Only an idiot or a hero would attempt to\
  \ follow him down this way, and it was clear the captain was neither.</p> \n   <p>Isra\
  \ didn’t allow himself the satisfaction of thinking he was away, not yet. He moved\
  \ fast, running between streets to a low point amid the garden walls and narrow\
  \ stinking alleys and scaled the side of one of the hovels, moving from wall to\
  \ window ledge to overhanging tree limb to rooftop in a series of gambits, and then\
  \ took off across the roofs, leaping and scrambling from house to house. This was\
  \ his city, up here. No one knew the high paths like he did. Finally he felt safe\
  \ enough in his escape to take stock of the mess.</p> \n   <p>He had been set up.\
  \ There was no other way of looking at it. He had been hired because he was the\
  \ target. They wanted to lure him into the jaws of their trap and spring it closed\
  \ on him. </p> \n   <p>No, he corrected himself. He wasn’t the target. The Nightwalker\
  \ was. There was a subtle difference, in that no one knew he was the assassin.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>So someone wanted the Nightwalker dead. Well, that was going to make things\
  \ interesting from now on. Perhaps it was time to lie low for a while, just concentrate\
  \ on being Isra, the lecherous wastrel squandering his family’s hard-earned fortune\
  \ on wine, women, song, and more women. There were certain benefits that went along\
  \ with the role, obviously—there was nothing so expensive or exotic his money could\
  \ not buy it. But man could not live on such frivolities alone. For now, though,\
  \ that was a bridge he would have to cross when he came to it.</p> \n   <p>A tile\
  \ slipped traitorously beneath his foot. The shift beneath him sent Isra skidding\
  \ precariously close to the edge. He teetered there, arms windmilling wildly until\
  \ he caught his balance. He cursed himself. He had been careless, and it had almost\
  \ cost him dearly. </p> \n   <p>It had also saved his life. A single rooftop away,\
  \ he saw the unmistakable shape of the damned captain charging like a bull across\
  \ the tiles, bearing down on him. </p> \n   <p>Isra spat a curse, and in a heartbeat\
  \ was running again. This time there was an element of fear in his blood. The captain\
  \ was relentless. Isra was going to have kill him, but he had no intention of going\
  \ toe-to-toe with the warrior. He needed to use the terrain to his advantage—after\
  \ all, this was <i>his</i> city. The captain belonged in the world below, not up\
  \ here.</p> \n   <p>He cast about, looking for somewhere narrow and preferably precarious.\
  \ There were dozens of obvious locations that suited his purpose. Katapesh was littered\
  \ with minarets and sharp-angled rooftops. Isra ran for the nearest, racing along\
  \ the crest of a great hall, using the spine of the watershed as a path. The captain\
  \ came crashing behind him, clay tiles crushing beneath his heavy boots.</p> \n\
  \   <p>“You really don’t have to do this,” Isra called, gasping for breath as he\
  \ swung himself up onto another rooftop. He wanted the man to think he was running\
  \ out of ideas as quickly as he was running out of breath. His plan depended upon\
  \ it.</p> \n   <p>The captain planted his hands on his knees, doubling over as he\
  \ battled to catch his own breath. When he looked up Isra was already on the move.\
  \ </p> \n   <p>A wooden stair coiled around the outside of the minaret. Isra hit\
  \ it running, the captain not far behind him. The captain didn’t waste his breath\
  \ on words.</p> \n   <p>And then they were at the top, a few feet between them,\
  \ the captain moving menacingly toward the assassin. It was a long way down. The\
  \ platform was precarious, the wood rotten in places. It creaked and groaned beneath\
  \ the big man’s weight, but it wasn’t about to break. Isra wasn’t going to be <i>that</i>\
  \ lucky.</p> \n   <p>“We can go our separate ways, never see each other again,”\
  \ Isra offered, doing his best to sound reasonable.</p> \n   <p>“I don’t think so,”\
  \ the captain said. He drew his sword.</p> \n   <p>The sun was beginning to come\
  \ up behind the captain, giving him wings of fire. </p> \n   <p>“Well, you can’\
  t say I didn’t offer,” Isra said flippantly. “Shall we dance?” He extended a hand,\
  \ goading the big man to come at him. </p> \n   <p>The big man did.</p> \n   <p>Isra\
  \ waited until the very last possible moment, danced back, and then pretended to\
  \ stumble. As the captain launched his attack, the assassin went to ground, crying\
  \ out to mask the fact that the fall was an act. As the captain came in for the\
  \ kill, Isra swept his right leg around in a tight arc and took the big man’s feet\
  \ out from under him.</p> \n   <p>For one agonizingly long moment, the stretched-out\
  \ silence between heartbeats, it looked as though the captain might save himself.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Then he was falling. Unfortunately for him, those wings of fire didn’\
  t help him fly.</p> \n   <p>Isra turned his back. He had no desire to watch the\
  \ man die. His secret was safe. That was all that mattered. He climbed slowly down\
  \ the wooden stairs. It was time to go home, get some sleep, and in the morning\
  \ go back to being the good-for-nothing merchant prince squandering his family fortune.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>But first, time to do what the night’s dead men had failed to do: put\
  \ the Nightwalker to sleep once and for all. </p> \n   <p>There was a drop box hidden\
  \ away in a deserted part of the city. It was where Isra collected his assignments\
  \ from Mirza, his agent, and when necessary left messages. The assassin worked blind.\
  \ Mirza had no idea of his identity. He didn’t need to. He was there to filter hits\
  \ and provide a layer of safety between Isra and his Nightwalker identity.</p> \n\
  \   <p>The pair had long ago established a signal to denote that the assassin was\
  \ laying aside his knife: a black pearl. Isra wore one on a string around his wrist.\
  \ As he reached the drop box, he snapped the string and opened the lid, ready to\
  \ put an end to the game. He’d almost gotten himself killed tonight, and he was\
  \ in no hurry to repeat the experience. What was the old adage? Go out on top before\
  \ you go out in a box?</p> \n   <p>He dropped the pearl into the metal box and closed\
  \ the lid.</p> \n   <p>Isra was three steps away before he realized that the pearl\
  \ hadn’t made a sound as it hit the bottom—meaning that it had fallen on something\
  \ soft. He took a deep breath and went back to the drop box. Isra opened the lid\
  \ again and reached inside. </p> \n   <p>There was an envelope. Another job. It\
  \ would be the last, Isra promised himself, tearing the envelope open.</p> \n  \
  \ <p>Inside was a single slip of paper with a name written on it.</p> \n   <p><i>Isra\
  \ Darzi.</i></p> \n   <p>It was an impossible assignment. No matter how legendary\
  \ the Nightwalker was, there was no way he could complete the kill.</p> \n   <p>Isra\
  \ Darzi just wasn’t the suicidal type.</p> \n   <p><b>Coming Next Week:</b> Masks\
