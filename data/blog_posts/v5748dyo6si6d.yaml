  \ itemprop=\"description\">This month I was lucky enough to attend two local conventions!\
  \ CinCityCon in Cincinnati, OH and Scarefest in Asheville, NC both welcomed me with\
  \ open arms. One of the best parts of my job is getting to see the effect our programs\
  \ have on the community, and these two weekends were a great opportunity for that.\
  \ I got to see community members rejoin games that hadn’t been seen since before\
  \ the pandemic, and even run some games for players who had never played before.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Conventions are one of the most valuable ways we have to reach new\
  \ players, and I’m glad I got to see it in action. It’s wonderful to know that the\
  \ community has remained resilient through the pandemic, and I can’t wait for what\
  \ 2023 brings. I highly recommend visiting either or both of these conventions,\
  \ you won’t be disappointed!</p> \n      <br clear=\"all\"> \n      <h2>Digital\
  \ Adventure Releases</h2> \n      <p>These adventures will be available on November\
  \ 30, 2022.</p> \n      <h3>Pathfinder Society</h3> \n      <p><a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02e18\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #4-06: Signal from the Electric Laboratory*</em></a></p>\
  \ \n      <h3>Starfinder Society</h3> \n      <p><a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02e19\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #5-11: Archivist's Inquiry*</em></a></p> \n   \
  \   <p>*part of a subscription</p> \n      <br> \n      <h2>The Replacement of Ehu\
  \ Hadif</h2> \n      <p><a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6si69?Ehu-Hadif-s-Mandate-Fulfilled-First-Seeker\"\
  >For those who didn’t hear last week</a>, Starfinder Society First Seeker Ehu Hadif\
  \ Ko’ra Amares of Clan Tolar, House Zye, tenth devotee from the line of Ahmu, is\
  \ retiring! The Lorespire Complex is already abuzz with discussion about who will\
  \ replace him and how that might change the Society.</p> \n      <p>If your character\
  \ thinks they’re right to take up the mantle, they can now apply! There is a First\
  \ Seeker Candidate boon in the Boon Store available for all character with 45 or\
  \ more Reputation with one faction. Once you purchase it, you’ll be given instructions\
  \ on how to submit your character’s information. We’ll evaluate the candidates and\
  \ choose the best to put up for a vote.</p> \n      <p>Good luck, Starfinders! </p>\
  \ \n      <br> \n      <h2>Sanctioning Update</h2> \n      <p>In October, we released\
  \ <b>27</b> new products. That’s a lot of content! Let’s take a look at what’s newly\
  \ sanctioned and what’s coming up.</p> \n      <h3>Pathfinder Society</h3> \n  \
  \    <p>Obviously, the big headline is the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/kingmakerap\"\
  ><em>Kingmaker Adventure Path</em></a>. This giant is now sanctioned for play; unlike\
  \ previous adventures, instead of chronicle sheets for distinct parts, <em>Kingmaker</em>\
  \ has one generic chronicle sheet. GMs should give out a chronicle for every 3 levels\
  \ their players earn while establishing their kingdom.</p> \n      <p>Additionally,\
  \ the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02e0m?Pathfinder-Kingmaker-Companion-Guide\"\
  ><em>Kingmaker Companion Guide</em></a> is now sanctioned! This book contains seven\
  \ shorter adventures featuring some of the companions, and there are chronicle sheets\
  \ available for each of them. Completing these adventures will grant players access\
  \ to specific character options provided by those companions.</p> \n      <p>Finally,\
  \ King Merlokrep rides again in the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02e4g?Pathfinder-Adventure-Crown-of-the-Kobold-King\"\
  ><em>Crown of the Kobold King</em></a> adventure! This module takes some classic\
  \ first edition adventures and updates them for second edition play. The module\
  \ is sanctioned for play in two halves; each half grants one level’s worth of XP\
  \ and commensurate rewards.</p> \n      <p>This month, our major release is <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/products/btq02dxx\"><em>Lost Omens: Impossible Lands</em></a>.\
  \ Our sanctioning for this book is complete and it should be ready to post on street\
  \ date. After that, we’ll start work on creating boons for the character options\
  \ in the Blood Lords Adventure Path, as well as clearing some time on our schedules\
  \ for the upcoming <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02dvy\"><em>Treasure\
  \ Vault</em></a> release.</p> \n      <h3>Starfinder Society</h3> \n      <p>Over\
  \ in Starfinder, the Drift Crisis is ongoing, and now you can experience it with\
  \ the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventures/adventurePath/driftCrashers\"\
  ><em>Drift Crashers</em> Adventure Path</a>! This adventure is now sanctioned for\
  \ play; chronicle sheets are available on the product pages, and the character options\
  \ are listed on the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/starfindersociety/characteroptions\"\
  >Character Options page</a>.</p> \n      <p>This month also brings the release of\
  \ <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02d4w\"><em>Starfinder Interstellar Species</em></a>,\
  \ a very exciting book that dives into some of Starfinder’s most popular species\
  \ and brings the new evolutionist class to life! We’re still working on our internal\
  \ review of this book, but it’s looking good for a street date sanctioning on this\
  \ as well. <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02d4x\"><em>To Defy the Dragon</em></a>,\
  \ the standalone adventure, will also be released in November, along with its sanctioning\
  \ documents. After those two, it’s pretty quiet on the Starfinder front until the\
  \ release of the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02dy2\"><em>Drift Crisis\
  \ Case Files</em></a> in early 2023.</p> \n      <br> \n      <h2>FAQ Answers and\
  \ Boons</h2> \n      <p>We’ve got some answers to some new FAQs over on the <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/faq\">Pathfinder Society page</a>! While the\
  \ big headline is the questions to “how do undead PCs even work in PFS,” there are\
  \ a couple of others regarding animal companions that have been outstanding for\
  \ a while now. Go ahead and check them out!</p> \n      <br> \n      <h2>GM Recognition</h2>\
  \ \n      <h3>Campaign Service Coins</h3> \n      <p>We award Campaign Service Coins\
  \ to members of the community who have gone above and beyond to provide an exceptional\
  \ program to the community at large. Campaign Coins are awarded based on nominations;\
  \ if you believe someone in your community is deserving of this award (whether or\
  \ not they are a Venture Officer), send an email to organizedplay[at]paizo[dot]com\
  \ with their name and reasons.</p> \n      <p>This month, we were able to award\
  \ Campaign Coins at CinCityCon, Scarefest, and Gobloween. Congratulations to:</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Erika Emrick, who now holds a Campaign Coin and Organized Play ID #<b>875</b><br>\
  \ Jess Miller-Camp, who now holds a Campaign Coin and Organized Play ID #<b>878</b><br>\
  \ and Landon Hatfield, who now holds a Campaign Coin and Organized Play ID #<b>879</b></p>\
  \ \n      <h3>GM Ranks</h3> \n      <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving\
  \ a 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the\
  \ 5th milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios\
  \ and 10 special scenarios as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains\
  \ (program dependent). A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th\
  \ milestone is 650 hours!</p> \n      <p>This month, we had one GM earn their 5th\
  \ Nova for SFS, and one GM earn their 5th Glyph for PFS2.</p> \n      <p><b>5th\
  \ Nova (SFS)</b>: Joseph Blomquist<br> <b>5th Glyph (PFS2)</b>: Aerine Caerwyn</p>\
  \ \n      <br> \n      <p>Until next time - Explore! Report! Cooperate! And build\
  \ your kingdoms!</p> \n      <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold; line-height:\
