               <p itemprop="description"><a href="/pathfinder/pathfinderSociety/pfsacg/season4">Season of Factions' Favor</a>, our current—and weirdest—Adventure Path for the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game is well underway. Designed by Keith Richmond with story by Katina Davis, Adventure 1, <a href="/products/btpy9wen?Pathfinder-Society-Adventure-Card-Guild-41-Chasing-Yellow-Sails"><em>Chasing Yellow Sails</em></a>, kicked off at Gen Con, leading the adventurers into the slave markets of Okeno in pursuit of a captured criminal. It's a rollicking adventure, and the upcoming Adventure 2 is also a mindbender.</p> 
               <p>But it's our first free promo scenario, the newly released <a href="/products/btpy9who?Pathfinder-Society-Adventure-Card-Guild-4P-Murder-in-the-Marketplace"><em>Murder in the Marketplace</em></a> that takes place between those adventures, that I think everyone will talk about for some time.</p> 
               <p>When the Pathfinder Society's John Compton and Tonya Woldridge first approached me about their plans for this Adventure Path, they had to answer the burning question: How do we justify the inclusion of our upcoming <a href="/products/btpy9s2o"><em>Hell's Vengeance Character Deck 1</em></a> and <a href="/products/btpy9sjy"><em>Deck 2</em></a>? The characters in Hell's Vengeance are all unrelentingly evil. Unlike in the RPG side of organized play, the ACG can handle evil characters. So characters like <a href="/products/btpy97ic">Wrathack</a>, <a href="/products/btpy97ib">Tontelizi</a>, and <a href="/products/btpy97id">Wu Shen</a> are all street-legal. But with Hell's Vengeance, these folks have a purpose. They work as a team. An evil team. For evil.</p> 
               <p>To make it clear why they would work with good guys, we needed to justify their inclusion in the story arc. I won't spoil for you why they're there. But I will tell you the way we set it up, because it's cool. Designed by Keith and written by Linda Zayas-Palmer, <em>Murder in the Marketplace</em> is not one scenario, it's three. Each one is a battle to find and defeat one of the Deck 1 iconics: the cleric Lazzero, the hellknight Linxia, or the antipaladin Urgraz. You can play any one of the scenarios you want, or all three. Because the purpose is not only to defeat these baddies, it's to <i>unleash</i> them.</p> 
               <p>If you win one of these Murder-fests, you get a special reward. Here's Lazzero's, with Linxia's and Urgraz's following the same pattern.</p> 
               <blockquote> 
                <p>Each player may, for each future scenario, choose to exchange his character that completed this scenario with Lazzero from <em>Hell's Vengeance Character Deck 1</em>. Lazzero gets the same number of skill, power, and card feats as the exchanged character, as well as all other applicable rewards that character has earned (including any valid deck upgrades and a role card if appropriate). Build Lazzero's deck from the <em>Hell's Vengeance Character Deck 1</em> box using the Hierarchy from the <a href="/products/btpy98no"><em>Pathfinder Society Adventure Card Guild Guide</em></a>. The exchanged character receives any rewards and upgrades from the scenario. Report the character as Unlocked Cleric Lazzero.</p> 
               </blockquote> 
               <p>When you unlock this character, you can swap him in for any other Adventure Card Guild character that completed that version of P1. At any time. At any <i>tier</i>. You don't have to build up the character over time. You just pick a character to swap for and say "I want to play this scenario with the guy in the devil hat here." Or the woman with the forehead tattoo. Or the guy with the crossbow bigger than his body. Whatever. And something similar will occur between adventures 2 and 3 for the Deck 2 characters.</p> 
               <p>Why do they get this amazing flexibility? I already told you that. It's because they're evil. And rules are for suckers. We'll have a preview of Deck 1 next time, and you can see what I mean.</p>

            <p itemprop="description">The Year of Factions' Favor has several intended themes—most notably a chance to feature factions' storylines in exciting ways—but Linda and I have found that this season lends itself to two themes that are equally gratifying: bringing back past NPCs and having them team up with the PCs directly to do awesome things. If you've followed earlier Pathfinder Society stories, you'll no doubt recognize several of these characters, as well as many more in the months to come. Even if you're newer to the campaign, we introduce these curators, adventurers, schemers, and scallywags in a way that should bring you up to speed in no time—and if you want recommendations on earlier scenarios to play leading up to these, the community's always happy to identify earlier pieces of the larger story.</p>

              <div itemprop="articlebody"> 
               <p>The team's been appreciating the slightly less hectic pace that's followed Gen Con and the end of what we consider convention season. That's no reason to slack off, though, and we've been busy with the contributions of some talented authors to bring you Season 9's next two scenarios. What's more, Chris Lambertz recently updated <a href="/pathfinderSociety">the Pathfinder Society page</a>!</p> 
               <p itemprop="description">The Year of Factions' Favor has several intended themes—most notably a chance to feature factions' storylines in exciting ways—but Linda and I have found that this season lends itself to two themes that are equally gratifying: bringing back past NPCs and having them team up with the PCs directly to do awesome things. If you've followed earlier Pathfinder Society stories, you'll no doubt recognize several of these characters, as well as many more in the months to come. Even if you're newer to the campaign, we introduce these curators, adventurers, schemers, and scallywags in a way that should bring you up to speed in no time—and if you want recommendations on earlier scenarios to play leading up to these, the community's always happy to identify earlier pieces of the larger story.</p> 
               <p>Of course, studying past events and the bigger picture is just the sort of things that historians, archaeologists, and Pathfinders do. My background is in archaeology, and I always like the occasional reminder that fieldwork isn't all cracking bullwhips and casting magic missile; a lot of public-sector archaeology (at least in the USA) is referred to as cultural resource management (CRM), which involves identifying, salvaging, and preserving archaeological sites—particularly those that might be impacted by imminent industrial or construction projects.</p> 
               <p>I like to think that the same sort of thing happens on Golarion, including in Thuvia, where <a href="/products/btpy9weo?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-9-04-The-Unseen-Inclusion"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #9-04: The Unseen Inclusion</em></a> takes place. As the city of Merab expands to accommodate new growth, construction teams periodically uncover undocumented ruins dating back to the Tekritanin League. Local archaeologists have some time to study and record their findings before building continues, though even this process can come to a screeching halt when that process uncovers supernatural dangers.</p> 
               <p>In this Tier 1-5 scenario, Mike Kimmel explores what happens when Obahar, one of the city's archaeologists, unleashes a screaming fiend that has escaped to terrorize the town. The Pathfinder Society's local venture-captain, Diya Akan, maintains a deal to assist with difficult ruins, and the PCs' first obligation is to help with the archaeological analysis of the treacherous site buried below. However, their discoveries have grave ramifications for one of the Society's closest allies, and the PCs must hurry if they're to avert additional disasters. This scenario plays an important role in setting up the upcoming <a href="/products/btpy9wer?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-9-07-Salvation-of-the-Sages"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #9-07: Salvation of the Sages</em></a>. Whether your Scarab Sages faction PCs are low level or higher, you won't want to miss these!</p>

               <p>The Blakros Museum has a well-deserved reputation for small-scale disasters related to its most recent exhibit of artifacts, statues, and other relics. Before the black basalt building housed the Blakros family's collections, it served as the observatory of the mighty Ralzeros the Overwatched, who used the structure to gaze into the cosmos and beyond. Alarms sound when an object on loan from the museum triggers a magical catastrophe in the Pathfinder Society's Grand Lodge, and it's up to the PCs to investigate, put a stop to the madness, and trace the mysterious relic to its source. Christopher Wasko has provided us a delightful Tier 3-7 adventure in <a href="/products/btpy9wep?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-9-05-Call-of-the-Copper-Gate"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #9-05: Call of the Copper Gate</em></a>. We're not only thrilled because this begins an engaging Dark Archive faction story that explores one of the most beloved (and infamous) sites in the Pathfinder Society campaign; we're also thrilled that the PCs in this adventure get to work directly alongside several familiar faces. Speaking of which, it's our pleasure to introduce you to Imrizade Blakros, who first appeared in <a href="/products/btpy8arc?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-35-Voice-in-the-Void"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #35: Voice in the Void</em></a> by Robert G.

              <p itemprop="description">With the Gen Con launch behind us, it's time to start jumping into our monthly scenario previews. I'm exceptionally excited to talk about <a href="/products/btpy9wes?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-1-04-Cries-From-the-Drift"><em>Starfinder Society #1-04: Cries from the Drift</em></a>. This is a scenario I think a lot of people (especially Exo-Guardians) will be talking about, as it includes several plot points we've only hinted at in our initial scenarios.</p> 
              <p>Cries from the Drift tasks the PCs with investigating a distress beacon recently sold to the Starfinder Society by a salvaging barge—a starship the PCs possibly encountered in one of our launch scenarios. The beacon, and the ship it belongs to, has special importance to the Exo-Guardians faction. Specifically, it has ties to the lost Exo-Guardian base of operations.</p> 
              <p>Here's a quick look at the tags that accompany this scenario:</p> 
              <ul>
               <li>Faction (Exo-Guardians)</li> 
               <li>Starship</li>
              </ul>

              </div> 
              <p>When planning our season scope, I knew that this scenario needed to include the above tags. When it came time to outlining the scenario, the more I fit the pieces together, the more I knew that the scenario would heavily involve a theme I have a particular love for: horror. Paizo's newest developer, Joe Pasini, did a fantastic job of putting together a terrifying starship for the PCs to explore. Along with that, he also adhered to my vehement request that we include Zigvigix and maintain the shirren faction leader's eternal optimism in the face of... well... awful and terrible things. And while Zigvigix does put on a good face during this scenario, I want to let people know that the storylines we are exploring include some pretty grim and dark (grimdark even) revelations for some our NPCs and factions.</p> 
              <p>Oh, before I go. I realized there's an unofficial tag I forgot to associate with this scenario. Since it's unofficial, I'm going to put it behind a spoiler tag.</p> 
              <input type="button" value="Show" class="spoilerButton" onclick="toggleSpoiler(this)">
              <div class="spoiler-text">

               </ul> 
              </div> 
              <p>I look forward to seeing everyone's reactions to Cries from the Drift, as well as any overall thoughts on our ongoing stories for the factions and Society. Come back next month, when we preview our next scenario <a href="/products/btpy9wet?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-1-05-The-First-Mandate"><em>Starfinder Society #1-05: The First Mandate</em></a>, which combines faction missions for the Acquisitives and Second Seeker (Luwazi Elsebo), as well as being the first of our "Scoured Stars" major storyline adventures!</p>

              <blockquote> 
               <p>Entering the grand finale of an Adventure Path—especially one played in front of the community—comes with plenty of trepidation and nostalgia. Our opening evening of marathon six was emotional, and we spent it reminiscing about some of our favorite moments in Strange Aeons. As our membership is spread across the country, even if we achieved victory we'd be saying goodbye to our characters and each other for what could be months or years; with fifteen active members, we've had some overlap but never the same roster in any project.</p> 
               <p>To help bring this marathon experience to life, our GM tapped another member as a live-NPC for the role of the mute musician Erich Zann, and we were joined once again by Savannah Broadway in the role of NPC Winter Klaczka. We also had plenty of props and music for the dark cabaret we would encounter in Paris, and actual wine labels for the bottles of Ruby Artemesia that would feature at a sinister gala.</p> 
               <p>For <a href="/products/btpy9qcm?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-114-Black-Stars-Beckon"><em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #114: Black Stars Beckon</em></a>, the entire marathon session was 104 hours long with 63 hours and 15 minutes of session hours.</p> 
               <h2>Highlights From Black Stars Beckon</h2> 
               <ul>
                <li>We needed to perform three rituals in order to sever Carcosa's connection to Golarion; these were lengthy, left us vulnerable, and worse yet: drew the attention of Great Old Ones. During our second ritual, a ghastly dream manifestation of Xhamen-Dor emerged to disrupt our casters. Erasmus, despite still suffering from the possession corruption, put his occult skills on display with <i>entrap spirit</i>—instantly ending the fight before it began.</li> 
                <li>The strangeness of this Adventure Path reached new levels with Carcosa's patchwork of cities stolen from different times and planets, but by this point we had found ways to embrace it. We invited ourselves to a vampire ball in ancient Azlant, where we threw caution to the wind and partied like it was -9999. Later on, we popped in on a cabaret full of Leng ghouls in 1890s Paris, where we sipped champagne and basked in the ambiance of La Belle Époque.</li> 
                <li>To reach our goal in an ice-enshrouded elder thing city, author Jim Groves challenged us with an old-school numbers puzzle that almost stopped the campaign. Immersion is important to the Order, so our GM wasn't ready to let us off the hook with an intelligence check. After two hours the group broke for sleep, leaving Sterling (Alahazra) alone with our notes. When we woke up the next morning, he had solved it.</li>
               </ul>

               <h2>The Experiment</h2> 
               <p>From otherworldly horror to the research rules, dream quests and occult rituals, this path just felt different from standard Pathfinder—which was exactly what we loved about it. Regarding the results of our experiment, we were all in agreement that not only can Strange Aeons be played by complete rookies to the Elder Mythos, but that we may have had the better deal by doing so!</p> 
               <h2>Character Deaths</h2> 
               <p>When Adam Daigle opened his introduction to <em>Black Stars Beckon</em> by apologizing for killing our characters, it helped us to consider PC-demise from a lighter perspective. With our group having regular access to <i>breath of life</i>, a <i>cauldron of resurrection</i>, and even <i>wish</i>, mortality was no longer an issue; with a number as high as sixteen, even death died.</p> 
               <h2>Best Quote From Marathon 6</h2> 
               <p><i>Cold silence before a gunfight in the cabaret.</i><br> Feiya: "Any ghoul that doesn't wanna get killed, better clear on out the back."</p> 
               <h2>The Strange Aeons Adventure Path by the Numbers</h2>

               <h2>How it Ended</h2> 
               <p>Atop a rain-soaked tower surrounded by a massive yellow sign, we faced off against Ariadnah the lich and the abomination that Count Lowls had become. Things got off to the kind of start you hope you'll never experience when playing for a championship. We lost two characters on the opening round, with Feiya dropped by a <i>horrid wilting</i> and Winter removed by a <i>maze</i>. The room was silent. We had to block out what was happening, find a way to rally, and do what any team might do in this situation: a Hail Mary. Alahazra threw it in the form of <i>disintegrate</i>, and the lich caught it in the face with a natural one. A few rounds and seven (consecutive) successful saving throws later, we were in a position to win. When the dust of victory finally settled, only Erasmus and Quinn were left holding the belt of Strange Aeons.</p>

Welcome to another installment of our <a href="/products/btpy9u16?Pathfinder-Battles-Maze-of-Death"><em>Pathfinder Battles: Maze of Death</em></a> previews. Releasing next month, <em>Maze of Death</em> is full of wickedly cool figures for you to encounter in your Pathfinder campaign. Up first this week is the Pitborn Fighter, a common medium based off of artwork found in <a href="/products/btpy8qzz?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Blood-of-Fiends"><em>Pathfinder Player Companion: Blood of Fiends</em></a>. I think he looks rad, especially for a common. The horns and spikes on his face are great, and I really love the armor.</p>

              </div> 
              <p>Next, we have the Ice Devil, an uncommon Large. While the paint scheme may be simple (ice), I love the detailing of its carapace, and the spear is freaking cool. This figure is based off of art from the <a href="/products/btpy8tj5?Pathfinder-Pawns-Bestiary-Box"><em>Bestiary Box</em></a>, and I really feel it does this devil service.</p> 
              <div class="blurbCenter">

              </div> 
              <p>To wrap up our devilish lineup is the Apostate Devil, which is a rare medium in this set. I think my favorite part of this figure is his cloak, which,if you look closely, is made out of the skins of its victims. Would you like to join its collection?</p> 
              <div class="blurbCenter">
               <a href="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20170925-ApostateDevil.jpg"><img src="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20170925-ApostateDevil_180.jpeg"></a>
              </div> 
              <p>Since it's fall, why not top off this week's preview with some festive snakes? To start, we have the Viper Vine, an uncommon large. The texturing and root fangs this things has is the stuff of nightmares. Think it is safe to take a day trip to see the fall colors? Wrong. Leafy poisonous death awaits.</p> 
              <div class="blurbCenter">

              </div> 
              <p>Next, what is better than a giant snake? A giant snake with two heads that can split and reattach as need be to more easily hunt you down and eat you. Meet the Amphisbaena, an uncommon large figure. This figure is just down right cool, and if any of your players have Ophidiophobia, I highly suggest you pickup at least one.</p> 
              <div class="blurbCenter">
               <a href="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20170925-Amphisbaena.jpg"><img src="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20170925-Amphisbaena_180.jpeg"></a>
              </div> 
              <p>Finally, while not snakelike in shape, still slimy, gross, and creepy, is the Canopy Lurker, a rare medium. Afraid of Octopi? Well then this is a must have miniature, because this is a giant carnivorous octopus that lives on land! Yay! I really like the color transitions, and the face is nightmare fuel.</p> 
              <div class="blurbCenter">

              <p itemprop="description">Many subscribers already have <a href="/products/btpy9tok?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Book-of-the-Damned"><em>Pathfinder RPG Book of the Damned</em></a> in their hands, but I'm not going to let them have all the fun talking about what's in this book. Last week I talked a bit about some of the rules in <em>Book of the Damned</em>, and today I'm here to talk about some of the lore and flavor.</p> 
              <p>While there is some information about your rank and file fiends, including handy tables for each type that lists the fiends by challenge rating and includes their role, what they like for offerings, and what book they can be found in, a big part of this book talks about the movers and shakers among the ranks of fiends.</p> 
              <p>Each of the fiendish demigods of the demons, devils, and daemons (demon lords, archdevils, Queens of Night, Horsemen, and even Ahriman, the Lord of All Divs) gets a spread to themselves, complete with full Fiendish Obedience boon information. These despicable beings all have an illustration too. Some illustrations are brand new, others already existed, but they're all wicked.</p> 
              <p>While the majority of the book deals with the "big three" families of fiends—daemons, demons, and devils—the remainder sheds some light on the lesser known fiends and their small realms scattered throughout the Outer Planes.</p> 
              <p>This includes the demigods of other fiends (asura ranas, kyton demagogues, oni daimo, qlippoth lords, rakshasa immortals, and sahkil tormentors), who all get some more description and flavor, along with the daemon harbingers, infernal dukes, malebranche, and nascent demon lords. Each of these gets information about their areas of concern, domains, subdomains, and favored weapon. With that you can build out enemy cultists and priests, or if you're playing in an evil campaign clerics and warpriests for player characters.</p> 
              <p>However, as is always the case, it leaves you wanting more. Sadly, not all of these fiendish demigods get the full Fiendish Obedience boons treatment, but they do get the basics. There is information about the obedience that a worshiper must complete each day and the spell-like abilities granted at different levels.</p> 
              <p>In addition to all the relevant information important to worshipers of these fiendish demigods, Book of the Damned also gives readers an entire chapter of information about the fiendish realms over which these fiends rule. In addition to information on Abaddon, the Abyss, Hell, and the River Styx that runs through them all, you get a look at places like kyton sanctuaries on the Plane of Shadow, rakshasa holdings and oni strongholds on the Material Plane, and desolate Xibalba, home of the sahkils, on the Ethereal Plane.</p>

              <p>Xibalba, the Land of Dread, is formed from the focused fears of billions of mortals, and is like a solid island in the hazy and indistinct Ethereal Plane. Different types of terrain radiate out from a seemingly abandoned city atop a high hill, all of which are studies in fright and terror. At the center of this desolate city is a massive black stepped pyramid, home to many of the sahkil tormentors.</p> 
              <p>Speaking of the bosses of my little fear babies, here's a look at the table of sahkil tormentors found in Book of the Damned. (Surprise! They all have the Fear subdomain, which is also found in this book.)</p>

              <p itemprop="description"><i>We're starting a new monthly-ish Pathfinder Adventure Card Game series on the blog. Homebrew Special will feature the finest in Pathfinder Adventure Card Game homebrew creations (often made using the <a href=" https://www.drivethrucards.com/builder/pathfinder" target="_blank">DriveThru Card Creator</a>), written by the homebrewers themselves. If you have a homebrew creation that you'd like to spotlight, let us know!</i></p> 
              <p>My name is Francesco Silvestri; on the forums, you may know me as Doppelschwert. Before I tell you a bit about a recent PACG homebrew project of mine, I'll tell you a little bit about my gaming interests. When I'm playing a roleplaying game, there are two narrative elements that I really enjoy:</p> 
              <p>The first element is a setting where the stakes are high. It's a bit clichéd to be the chosen one all the time, I give you that, but while everyone can save a kitten or two from a tree or slay some rats in a cellar, few heroes are able to pull off such astonishing feats that you might call them <i>mythic</i>. As such, I immediately fell in love with the Wrath of the Righteous set when I got it last summer.</p> 
              <p>The second element is the inclusion of antiheroes. Don't get me wrong: I like to play as Hero McRighteousface just as much as the next guy, but there is a special itch that I can only scratch when the bad guys are doing the right thing for the wrong reasons. In PACG, folks like Wrathack and Darago immediately come to mind as fitting this role nicely.</p> 
              <div class="blurbCenter">
               <a href="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-Khorramzadeh.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-Khorramzadeh_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6807-DaragoRole.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6807-DaragoRole_180.jpeg"></a> 
               <p><i>Epic adversaries—check. Pragmatic protagonists—check.</i></p>
              </div> 
              <p>So I wanted to make a homebrew PACG Adventure Path that combines these things, with a focus on the bad guys being able to live up to their morally grey standards. I proudly present the variant AP for Wrath of the Righteous that I've been working on: Revenge of the Wicked, or RotW for short, is my personal antithesis to WotR (see what I did there?).</p> 
              <p>You start RotW as a bunch of shady characters of your choosing, and it doesn't take long for you to meet the wrong people at the (seemingly) right time. One thing leads to another, and before you know it, you've signed up with the Templars of the Ivory Labyrinth and are eager to become demoniacs—cultists of demon lords with the goal of turning themselves partially into demons, just like their RPG counterparts from <a href="/products/btpy8hij?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Book-of-the-Damned-Volume-2-Lords-of-Chaos"><em>Lords of Chaos</em></a>. Of course, you'll eventually achieve this goal—the end justifies the means, after all, and who's going to stop you?—but more on that later.</p> 
              <p>This 33-scenario tale chronicles your rise to power that takes you all over the Worldwound, the Abyss, and even into the Darklands! Along the way, there are plenty of opportunities to live up to your bad reputation. And while the forces of good will eventually try to stop you from doing exactly that, there are some familiar faces to help you out as well.</p> 
              <p>I won't tell you any more of the story, so you can go into it unspoiled. But who knows: you might just end up doing the right thing in the end!</p> 
              <div class="blurbCenter">
               <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20170922-ClericOfIomedae.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20170922-ClericOfIomedae_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20170922-ExposedIdentity.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20170922-ExposedIdentity_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20170922-DevilSteed.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20170922-DevilSteed_180.jpeg"></a> 
               <p><i>Your mount might have something to do with your cover being blown...</i></p>
              </div> 
              <p>Let's talk a bit about what RotW has to offer in terms of game mechanics. As you can see, there are custom cards—25 in total. Most are villains, henchmen, and support cards, but there are also some boons to replace thematically unfitting cards, as well as new barriers to replace some of the more infamous barriers of WotR.</p> 
              <p>Thanks to Ludwig Orsingher, better known as user LudwigO on the paizo forums, I'll be able to replace the current RotW cards with the awesome preview pictures you can see on this blog for my next update, and I am really grateful for all the work he put into making RotW a much prettier experience for everyone.</p> 
              <p>While optional, you are also encouraged to shuffle the upcoming <a href="/products/btpy9s2o?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Hells-Vengeance-Character-Deck-1"><em>Hell's Vengeance Character Deck 1</em></a> and <a href="/products/btpy9sjy?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Hells-Vengeance-Character-Deck-2"><em>Deck 2</em></a> into the box. Not only will that enrich the atmosphere dramatically, but it will also give you access to some pretty rad evil characters to play. You'll hardly find a better place to let them loose on whoever dares to get in their way!</p> 
              <p>You might be wondering what I've done with all the support cards from WotR: mythic paths, cohorts, servitor demons, and the redemption table. In RotW, almost all of those cards are either unused or replaced with new variants. Since you play a bunch of cultists, you don't get a mythic power source or a redemption table; instead, you become demoniacs and receive access to the patron table, which memorializes the demon lords you've served well in the past!</p>

I have good news for you: she won't be around this time... and you get to summon those demons yourselves instead, thanks to the conjuration mechanic. Basically, it works like Summon Monster, but you get to choose a monster from the Conjuration table according to your number of mythic charges (while servants that have the Undead trait get an additional 1d6).</p> 
              <p>While you lose access to the constant bonus to skills and those shiny d20s from the original mythic paths, you can instead spend mythic charges to help with any skill, and you can utilize Corrupted cards to use and generate those charges. As a result, the AP feels quite different from WotR. There might just be even more mythic paths to unlock further into the AP (just don't tell the demon lords I told you that).</p> 
              <p>Finally, the servitor demons are demons no more—righteous heroes have arrived to thwart your plans instead, and they offer some interesting abilities that interact with the new mythic path.</p>

             <div itemprop="articlebody"> 
              <p itemprop="description">One of my favorite things about Pathfinder Society (and now Starfinder Society) derives from the portability of the campaign. I started playing during Season 2 of Pathfinder Society. Since then, I've lived in three different locations (four, if you count my home in Las Vegas.) No matter where my family moved, we either found a Pathfinder Society community or built one. Being able to game anywhere made it easier to pick up roots and move again, knowing there would be a group of friends waiting at my destination.</p> 
              <p>But what happens when you don't have people nearby, or work a non-traditional schedule, or family commitments get in the way of participating in local games. Great news. Not only do we have thriving gaming communities centered on physical locations, we have a robust online scene as well. The partnership of Paizo with several Virtual Tabletops gives a variety of platforms for play. In addition, the Play-by-Post (PbP) community hosts loads of games. And that is the focus of our blog this week.</p> 
              <p>Instead of bringing my limited knowledge to the table, I'm handing the keys of the keyboard to our esteemed PbP Venture-Lieutenant Hilary Moon Murphy (HMM). She'll give you the ins and out of participating in one of the most roleplay driven gaming styles.</p> 
              <p>Before I do that, I want to call out two other organized play items. The first involves the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game. Due to a few crossed wires, <a href="/products/btpy9wen?Pathfinder-Society-Adventure-Card-Guild-41-Chasing-Yellow-Sails">&lt;&lt;<em>Pathfinder Society Adventure Card Guild #4-1—Chasing Yellow Sails</em></a>released in its' entirety last week. Next up, a special promotional adventure <a href="/products/btpy9who?Pathfinder-Society-Adventure-Card-Guild-4P-Murder-in-the-Marketplace"><em>Pathfinder Society Adventure Card Guild #4-P1—Murder in the Marketplace</em></a> that ties into the upcoming <a href="/products/btpy9s2o?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Hells-Vengeance-Character-Deck-1"><em>Hell's Vengeance Character Deck</em></a> releasing in October.</p> 
              <p>I also wanted to point everyone to the <a href="/pathfindersociety/rpg/additional">Roleplaying Guild Additional Resources section of the website</a>. Thanks to John &amp; Linda, the updates are ready for June, July, and August publications.</p> 
              <blockquote> 
               <h2>The Play-by-Post Community</h2> 
               <p>In December of 2014, I stumbled into my very first Play-by-Post game as a replacement player. It was a bizarre We Be Goblins game that turned into a musical. Everyone was engaged, the story was a delight, and I found myself refreshing constantly throughout the day for updates of the wacky antics of my fellow players and this delightful story that we created as a team.</p> 
               <p>It's also the moment that I fell in love with Play-by-Post, realizing the myriad possibilities of gaming in this manner.</p> 
               <h3>An Assortment of Cool Things</h3> 
               <p><b>Story-Driven and Flavor-Filled</b>. Play-by-Post is Immersive, and offers the opportunity for rich roleplay. You can do things in Play-by-Post that may not be feasible at an in-person table. Characters often reveal hidden thoughts and motivations, building out a character's rich backstory. Snarky familiars can get their own avatars and become fully fledged party members. You can split the party, offer side adventures, brooding interior monologues... all without slowing down the game for others. As a GM, one of the things that I love to do is bring out the quirky and varied settings of Golarian. Play-by-Post gives more time for party exploration and discovery.</p> 
               <p><b>Inclusive &amp; Easy to Schedule</b>. "You don't have to actually leave your home or talk to anyone to play" wrote a PbPer named Lady Ladile: "It's a fantastic medium for the shy, the introverted, the home-bound, the anxious, the stay-at home parent, the busy worker, etc. You don't have to leave your family, or try to wrangle several people's schedules in order to play maybe once a month if you're lucky. You don't have to speak if you're not comfortable with speaking or not good at speaking. All you need is some sort of internet-capable device and a connection. As someone who <i>is</i> shy, introverted, works an oddball schedule, and isn't a good speaker or quick-thinker, this is a key reason that I love PbP as much as I do."</p> 
               <p><b>A Warm &amp; International Community of Gamers</b>. In our most recent special, I noticed GMs that hailed not only from North America, but also from Indonesia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Singapore and Switzerland. Most of the tables I've played at have been international in some way. PBP allows you to make friends with people from all over the world, and our lodges love welcoming new players.</p> 
               <h3>Some Things to Consider</h3> 
               <p><b>Play-by-Post can be Slow</b>. Games take weeks to complete, and your characters will be tied up in that game for the full run. However, that slowness also gives you time to think about your next move.</p> 
               <p><b>People can flake sometimes.</b> Just like no-shows in real life games, sometimes people disappear. In all the PBP lodges players and GMs look out after each other; we all know that actual life can sometimes get in the way of the game. If a replacement is needed they are found quickly; no game is orphaned long.</p> 
               <h3>Want to Try It Out?</h3> 
               <p><a href="/threads/rzs2uejc&amp;page=1?Announcing-PlaybyPost-Gameday-VI"><b>Play-by-Post Gameday VI starts August 25th!</b></a> A few of our GMs have even <a href="http://tinyurl.com/PbPGD6NPGF">reserved seats specifically for players new to Play-by-Post!</a> This is our annual Play-by-Post Convention, one that you can attend without leaving home. We'd love to have you try out a game, and come be a part of our community too.</p> 
               <p>Have questions about PbP, ask them here! Our community of PBP veterans are happy to share their experiences.</p>

              <p>Starfinder's space goblins are pests, to be sure, whether they are hiding in the ventilation systems of Absalom Station or establishing their own "empire" on a tiny asteroid in the Diaspora. But their antics can be amusing, especially when it isn't you standing at the business end of a makeshift junklaser. To that end, we have continued the fine tradition of the <em>Pathfinder RPG Condition Cards</em> by showing space goblins having various conditions inflicted upon them in the <a href="/products/btpy9s2d?Starfinder-Condition-Cards"><em>Starfinder Condition Cards</em></a>.</p>

Unfortunately, no manufacturing process is perfect, so there are always going to be a handful of issues, but by the time we came back from Gen Con, we had received more complaints than we would expect for a print run this size. We talked to our printer about it, and sent them some samples demonstrating the issue.

              <p itemprop="description">Shortly after we began shipping <em>Starfinder Core Rulebooks</em> out, our customers started reporting issues with the binding, in both the regular and limited editions. Unfortunately, no manufacturing process is perfect, so there are always going to be a handful of issues, but by the time we came back from Gen Con, we had received more complaints than we would expect for a print run this size. We talked to our printer about it, and sent them some samples demonstrating the issue. They agreed that there was a problem, and they are doing everything they can to help us make it right for anyone who was affected.</p> 
              <h3>What's the Problem?</h3> 
              <p>Our hardcovers use a method called <i>case binding</i>. First, each group of 16 pages (a <i>signature</i>) is sewn together. Next, all of the book's signatures are stacked into a <i>book block</i>, and the book block is stitched together. Then, a fabric reinforcement strip called a <i>spine lining</i> is adhered to the book block to give it additional stability, and the book block is attached to the cover by adhering the book's endpapers to it. (Note that the spine lining itself is not glued to the spine of the book. This is intentional: it helps the book lie flatter when open.)</p> 
              <p>The problem some customers are seeing with their <em>Starfinder Core Rulebooks</em> is that the fabric lining strip isn't properly attached to the book block, separating after minimal use. This issue is occurring only with a small fraction of <em>Starfinder Core Rulebooks</em>, so if you have been using your book and it doesn't currently show any sign of the lining strip separating, it probably won't occur with normal use.</p>

               <p>In this photo of a book with a defective binding, the pages of the book are not attached to the yellow-and-white fabric lining strip at the bottom.</p>
              </div> 
              <h3>How Do I Get My Book Replaced?</h3> 
              <p>If you have a <em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em> with a defective binding, don't hesitate to have it replaced.</p> 
              <ul>
               <li>If you bought it from Paizo at Gen Con or through paizo.com, please send a picture or two demonstrating the problem with your book to <a href="mailto:customer.service@paizo.com?Subject=Starfinder-Core-Rulebook-Binding">customer.service@paizo.com</a>. (Please be aware that our customer service team is currently working through a significant backlog, so it may take several days for us to respond.)</li> 
               <li>If you bought it from a store, return it to that store by Friday, October 27. You should be able to get an exchange from them or reserve a replacement if the retailer is out of stock. They will in turn receive an exchange or credit from the distributor they bought it from, and the distributor will do the same with us. (We have already contacted our distributors regarding this issue, so your store should be able to work with them to address this issue.) If your store remains unable or unwilling to help you let us know at <a href="mailto:customer.service@paizo.com?Subject=Starfinder-Core-Rulebook-Binding">customer.service@paizo.com</a>; include the store's name and location so we can work with our distributors to ensure everyone is on the same page.</li>
              </ul> 
              <h3>When Will My Book Be Replaced?</h3> 
              <ul>
               <li>If you bought the regular edition from paizo.com, we will send out your replacement as quickly as possible, likely within 1 to 6 business days of responding to your email.</li> 
               <li>If you bought the regular edition from a store, they may be able to replace it for you immediately. However, the <em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em> is sold out in many places, and we don't expect the reprint to reach stores until the second half of November; if your store is sold out, you may need to wait until then. Check with them to be sure.</li> 
               <li>If you bought the limited edition from paizo.com or at Gen Con, we currently don't have replacement stock. Our printer is going to ship us replacement copies of the limited edition along with the regular edition reprint, which we currently estimate will reach our warehouse in the first half of November.</li>
              </ul> 
              <h3>Should I Wait for the Reprint to Arrive?</h3> 
              <p>There's no need to wait for the reprint before requesting to have your book replaced. We are checking the books we're sending out, and you should be able to check any replacement your retailer has. And in the case of the limited edition, though we won't be able to ship your replacement right away, we can put the order into the system at any time so it will be ready to go when stock arrives. (The reprint will not have any changes apart from than the words "Second Printing" on the masthead page—it should otherwise be identical to a properly bound first-printing copy in every way.)</p> 
              <p>Paizo and our printer have high standards for quality, and we are very sorry for this inconvenience. We will do what we can to make getting replacements a quick and easy process.</p>

              <p itemprop="description">With a thirst for the fiendish, subscribers have begun digging their claws into <a href="/products/btpy9tok?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Book-of-the-Damned"><em>Pathfinder RPG Book of the Damned</em></a>. What vile and wicked things might they find within its covers?</p> 
              <p>While much of the book contains information on the fiendish movers and shakers of the outer planes and their horrid and terrifying realms, I know that many of you want a glimpse at some of the rules found in the <em>Book of the Damned</em>. Some of the strongest fiends in the planes have risen to become fiendish divinities. This includes archdevils, demon lords, daemonic horsemen, and others. Fifty of these fiendish divinities receive full information on their fiendish boons that work with the Fiendish Obedience feat and the associated prestige classes. In addition, the demoniac, diabolist, and souldrinker have all been updated to work with these boons as well, and Book of the Damned includes a sidebar that provides additional guidance.</p> 
              <blockquote> 
               <h3>Fiendish Divinity Boons</h3> 
               <p>The boons granted by fiendish divinities assume that characters gain them in one of two ways—via the Fiendish Obedience feat (see page 178) or via that feat plus one of the three prestige classes presented on pages 208-213. While the boons of each divinity are categorized into the same three categories of boons used in <em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Inner Sea Gods</em>, the boons granted by deities in that book are less powerful, as they are more likely to be boons gained by PCs, and thus it’s more appropriate for them to be gained at earlier levels.</p> 
               <p>While the Hit Dice at which you gain boons via Fiendish Obedience or Deific Obedience (from <em>Inner Sea Gods</em>) are identical, the prestige classes in <em>Inner Sea Gods</em> (the evangelist, exalted, and sentinel) that allow accelerated boon achievement have lower entrance requirements than the prestige classes in this book. As a result, if you wish to use one of those three prestige classes for a character who wishes to gain the boons presented by one of the fiendish divinities in this book, increase the requirements for entry into evangelist, exalted, or sentinel so that a character must be 7th level before selecting the class, as summarized below.</p> 
               <p><b>Evangelist</b>: Base attack bonus +7, 7 ranks in a skill other than Knowledge (religion), or ability to cast 4th-level spells.</p> 
               <p><b>Exalted</b>: Diplomacy 7 ranks, Knowledge (religion) 7 ranks, ability to cast 4th-level divine spells.</p> 
               <p><b>Sentinel</b>: Base attack bonus +7.</p> 
              </blockquote> 
              <p>The third chapter of <em>Book of the Damned</em> has more rules mechanics to help a GM run a game dripping with fiendish influence. It contains feats to help you add new and exciting abilities to your villains and fiends, spells and rituals to spice things up, information on infernal contracts, and evil magic items, talismans, and artifacts—including the <em>Book of the Damned</em> itself!</p> 
              <p>The final chapter in the book presents a new fiend of each type, as well as statistics for petitioners in each fiendish realm: The damned of Hell, the hunted of Abaddon, larva from the Abyss, the mutilated of the Shadow Plane, the prey of the Material, and the terrorized of the Ethereal.</p> 
              <p>The new fiends in the <em>Book of the Damned</em> are as follows:</p>

We've managed to sneak his work into <a href="/blog/v5748dyo5lhs8">Season of the Righteous</a> and the <a href="/products/btpy9mbi?Summoner-Class-Deck"><em>Summoner Class Deck</em></a>, and he happily helped us out with this set, writing the flavor text for his characters.</p> 
              <div class="blurbCenter">
               <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6822-VarianCharacterFront.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6822-VarianCharacterFront_360.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6822-Academician.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6822-Academician_360.jpeg"></a> 
               <p>"Some choose to wield the sword, others the grimoire. I note that we have two hands."</p>
              </div> 
              <p>Count Varian can't memorize spells in the normal fashion. Thankfully, he's more than willing to throw money at solving that problem, and has years of fencing expertise as backup. He's also a renowned noble and ambassador of Cheliax, a graduate of the Acadamae, and a Pathfinder Society Venture-Captain. He's done fairly well, if he does say so himself.</p> 
              <div class="blurbCenter">
               <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6822-RadovanCharacterFront.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6822-RadovanCharacterFront_360.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6822-Norge.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6822-Norge_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6822-PitboundBodyguard.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6822-PitboundBodyguard_360.jpeg"></a> 
               <p>"Listen up, you mooks. You die, makes me look bad. You know how much I like to look good."</p>
              </div> 
              <p>Radovan's a wise-mouthed hellspawn, ready to literally jump into the fire to save his boss, Varian. Fortunately, the devil Norge keeps Radovan from burning. Less fortunately, the veritable host of devils whispering temptations to Radovan are just waiting for their opportunity to take control of his body, burst out into the world, or turn him into a gateway to Hell. Radovan really does have all the luck.</p> 
              <p>The deck also includes several signature boons from Radovan and Varian's adventures. I imagine basically all players of Varian will want Arnisant to accompany them. Just look at this face:</p> 
              <div class="blurbCenter">
               <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6822-Arnisant.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6822-Arnisant_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6822-RedLeathers.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6822-RedLeathers_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6822-ShadowlessSword.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6822-ShadowlessSword_180.jpeg"></a> 
               <p>"Of course I am not comparing you to my hound. Arnisant is obedient to a fault."</p>
              </div> 
              <p>The third character was selected almost as quickly, as we laid out a slew of major characters and images, and Mike quickly said something like: "And here's a bunch of other characters and THE LUNAR NAGA WE'RE GOING TO MAKE." Artist Eric Belisle really did an amazing job on Celeste and the team immediately agreed we had to bring her to life.</p> 
              <div class="blurbCenter">
               <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6822-CelesteCharacterFront.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6822-CelesteCharacterFront_360.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6822-Astrologer.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6822-Astrologer_360.jpeg"></a> 
               <p>Lunar nagas make the best pirate astrologers!</p>
              </div> 
              <p>That settled, what to do with all of the other amazing characters in Tales? SO. MANY. ALLIES. And one very talkative weapon.</p> 
              <div class="blurbCenter">
               <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6822-Appleslayer.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6822-Appleslayer_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6822-ToriusVin.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6822-ToriusVin_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6822-Hrym.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6822-Hrym_180.jpeg"></a> 
               <p>Warning: Do not buy this deck if you are allergic to pictures of adorable puppies.</p>
              </div> 
              <p>I really wanted to highlight the synergy of characters from the same Tales, so that you weren't just picking the best mechanics, but had a genuine reason to keep Hrym united with Rodrick or Torius Vin with his crew, or Zae and Keren Rhinn with Appleslayer. Also, Mike threatened to shank anyone who stood in the way of Appleslayer's inclusion in the deck.</p> 
              <div class="blurbCenter">
               <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6822-Akina.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6822-Akina_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6822-ShyRatani.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6822-ShyRatani_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6822-Elyana.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6822-Elyana_180.jpeg"></a> 
               <p>No previously existing allies were included in the making of this deck.</p>
              </div> 
              <p>Of course, some of these folks are amazing all on their own. The Tales deck includes some of the best allies we've ever made. We expect fans of Drelm from the <a href="/products/btpy9reo?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Mummys-Mask-Character-AddOn-Deck"><em>Mummy's Mask Character Add-On Deck</em></a> will like Elyana, who appears alongside Drelm in the novel <a href="/products/btpy8iqp?Plague-of-Shadows"><em>Plague of Shadows</em></a>.</p> 
              <p>But don't imagine that the <i>23 all-new allies</i> are the only new boons in the Tales deck. There are plenty more, including legendary weapons and tomes of arcane and powerful lore.</p> 
              <div class="blurbCenter">
               <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6822-Wayfinder.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6822-Wayfinder_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6822-LacunaCodex.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6822-LacunaCodex_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6822-StealBook.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6822-Stealbook_180.jpeg"></a> 
               <p>Sometimes you just need to find a really scary book. And steal it.</p>
              </div> 
              <p>A lot of these boons interact with specific allies; for example, the ally Eando Kline will let you recharge that Wayfinder from your discard pile.</p> 
              <p>The hope and goal was always that any Pathfinder Tales fan would have no regrets adding this class deck to each and every set. And maybe a few card players can get some great plays out of the cards, then seek out the stories that spawned them.</p>

After Tonya copied the entries into a form we could review without seeing any author names, the team set to reading through the 53 narratives and picking out our favorites.</p> 
              <p>We've included our top four picks below, and it's now the community's turn to decide. Vote for your favorite by <b>September 29 at 5:00 PM Pacific time</b> and we'll announce the winner soon afterward in a later blog. Remember that those who participate in the contest—including in the voting process—contribute to the Liberty's Edge faction's goals for the recent Season 9 <a href="/products/btpy9dgw?Pathfinder-Society-Faction-Journal-Cards">Faction Journal Cards</a> update.</p> 
              <p>When we launched this contest, we were still several weeks away from the release of <a href="/products/btpy9tlb?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-902-A-Case-of-Missing-Persons"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #9-02: A Case of Missing Persons</em></a>. That adventure has a significant Liberty's Edge faction connection, and I encourage everyone to play it. It also provides a little more context for this contest—not necessary to vote on your favorite background, but potentially helpful. I've included that information in a spoiler below, so investigate at your own peril.</p> <b>Pathfinder Society Scenario #9-02 Spoiler</b>

               Major Colson Maldris has gone missing, and it seems he's enlisted some very questionable allies. Without an appointed leader, the Liberty's Edge faction needs a temporary leader to keep the operation running smoothly and coordinate the hunt for Maldris. Might this individual take on the challenge?
              </div> 
              <blockquote> 
               <h3>Daarit Kwelu</h3> 
               <p>Daarit Kwelu was born in the abolitionist city-state of Senghor. Her father, Tadesse, was a scrupulous investor in the long haul sea trade who used his fortune to ensure that his two daughters would be free to pursue their own paths in life. While her younger sister, Rensaret, decided to put her talents into the Senghorian navy, Daarit chose to go to the Magaambya and put her mind to work.</p> 
               <p>Her education in Nantambu focused on the modern and ancient languages of the Inner Sea, and she quickly began serving as a junior translator for visiting scholars. Daarit proved her lexical mastery when she assisted Neiford Sharrowsmith in deciphering a recovered codex from a fallen Shory sky city. Her ability to interpret subtle nuances in the Shory language helped render ancient metaphors into functional formulae, unlocking new and deeper understandings of the lost aeromantic arts.</p> 
               <p>That Shory text awakened in her a sense of awe and pride in the history of the Expanse and its people. Fueled by these stories of ancestors who conquered earth and sky, she became even more attuned to the liberator's cause; seeing in each Mwangi slave a sky master chained to the ground.</p> 
               <p>Upon completing her studies, Daarit returned home with a dream of restoring the ancient power and glory of the Expanse. Her vision of a great nation for a free and united Mwangi people was well received by council elder Helise Solu who saw in her a voice for his own expansionist politics. Daarit now serves as a translator and diplomat for Senghor, brokering alliances between the Mwangi free cities, advocating for the abolition of slavery throughout Garund, and hoping, one day, to see her people return to the sky.</p> 
               <h3>Folami Kanye</h3> 
               <p>Folami Kanye was born on the waves to a family of Ombo pirates and slavers, and from birth she was trained to be a savvy negotiator and capable fighter. However, her relatives' actions never sat well with her, especially in Sargava. She felt as though the Ijo they frequently abducted were her own people and wished that the two groups could unite against their Chelish oppressors.</p> 
               <p>When Folami was 19, her family captured an elderly Ijo woman named Abena, who reminded Folami of her deceased grandmother. After a storm destroyed their provisions, Folami's sister Ife, the vessel's captain, ordered the deaths of Abena and two other slaves to save resources. In a daring rescue, which even Folami admitted worked only because Ife never suspected her sister's betrayal, Folami fought off her sister's guards and hustled the slaves to a life boat. Unwilling to harm her sister, Ife did not pursue, and an Ijo fishing vessel picked up Folami, Abena, and the others.</p> 
               <p>Over the next few years, Folami set up a small but thriving operation to rescue slaves from Ombo pirates like her family. Her friend Abena manages Folami's headquarters, all the while chiding her to find a more peaceful solution to Ijo problems. Folami realizes that her endeavors are adding to the Bonuwat vs. Bonuwat fighting that she found counterproductive in her youth, but at least now she fights for justice.</p> 
               <p>When the Pathfinder Society won the Sargava Chalice in 4717 and even extracted concessions from the Chelish nobles regarding the cup's ownership, Folami recognized that an alliance with the organization might help her realize the goals of freedom on a larger scale. After doing some research, she contacted Colson Maldris and offered her team's services in exchange for a broadening of Liberty's Edge's endeavors in Western Garund.</p> 
               <h3>Helakai Ironsi</h3> 
               <p>Helakai Ironsi is a traveling manifestation of the ethics of her Caldaru heritage. Born and raised in Senghor, as most Caldaru are, Helakai has grown into a dual role in life. She travels openly as a merchant, yet in private she is a steadfast vessel of the Bonuwat diety known as Shimye-Magalla.</p> 
               <p>Her travels take her from Senghor to Bloodcove and then up the Vanji River to Nantambu and Lake Ocota. Not specializing in any one product, she selects from the variety of goods that arrive in Senghor to make up her cargo for the upriver journey. It is in the return trip downriver that she serves Shimye-Magalla and her ancestors' spirits.</p> 
               <p>Helakai runs escaped slaves, hidden among her crew or concealed by her magic. Outwardly her vessel is filled with trade goods from the interior, but this simply defrays the cost of bringing those unfortunates to Senghor and the freedom of that doorway to the open sea. Some will challenge her story, but she is resourceful and has always won free.</p> 
               <p>She sees as her greatest danger the possibility of a double-agent posing as an escaped slave. This would be serious trouble if she was ratted out to the Aspis Consortium in Bloodcove. Fighting through the Aspis base is not an option, subterfuge is the only tactic that works. Helakai has become quite skilled at that.</p> 
               <p>Her current and recent trading partners include Aya Allahe and Sharrowsmith's Exports, through which she has become aware of the Pathfinder Society and their links in the wider world. Lately that connection has become more active.</p> 
               <h3>Karisa Starsight</h3> 
               <p>The pirate slaver Kolm Redarax of the <i>Besmara's Lash</i> came upon an adrift Bonuwat ship. Redarax found the crew entirely missing with no sign of violence. Just as he set to leave the apparently cursed vessel, an infant's cry was heard. Redarax found a swaddled Bonuwat girl-child. When the infant opened her eyes, Redarax noticed their striking blue color that seemed radiant in the sun. Redarax named her Karisa Starsight—his daughter.</p> 
               <p>Being the daughter of the captain did not exempt Karisa from duty. She tended to the needs of the slaves Redarax traded in various Garundi ports. She came to realize the slaves were people with the same worth as any other. As she grew into a young adult, she was torn between the plight of the slaves and her love for her father.</p> 
               <p>One day the <i>Besmara's Lash</i> was attacked by a Gray Corsairs vessel, captained by a friend of Major Colson Madris. The Corsairs were victorious. When the Andoren captain was about to put Redarax to the sword, Karisa intervened. She pledged her service to Andoran and freedom in exchange for Redarax's life. The captain agreed, but reasoned that putting her into simple servitude would be an act little better than those of Redarax. He decided to send her to be mentored by his friend Madris in Absalom, while Redarax was taken to an Andoren prison.</p> 
               <p>Karisa quickly excelled as an aide to Madris. Life at sea has given her a disciplined work ethic, enhanced by interpersonal skills learned from many cultures. Madris has made her his steward, having her assign Pathfinders and other agents to various tasks in the cause of freedom. Karisa is proud of her role, but she can't forget that her father—no matter how much she despises his morals—is himself bound in chains.</p> 
               <h3>Orisa Ombo</h3> 
               <p>Traders know Orisa Ombo as the powerful scion of the nine-feathers trading house. She travels throughout Garund and Avistan, sternly trading the wares of her family: rare hardwoods, magical items, seafood and most heartlessly, slaves. The cold-hearted Lady Ombo cuts hard bargains and doesn't flinch from questionable tactics. She has brought profit and renown to her house, but she is not the woman she used to be.</p> 
               <p>Several years ago, Orisa collected a group of Bonuwat slaves to trade in Katapesh. Among them was a Janni priest of Shimye-Magalla known as Ardrashir. Ancient tradition among the Bonuwat forbid harming servants of this nature god, but Orisa sold him to depraved cultists of Lamashtu for great profit. The night the priest was sacrificed, Orisa tossed and turned in her fine bed, and she was visited by a vision of Shimye-Magalla. The angry spirit fused the soul of Ardashir into Orisa Ombo and cursed her for breaking the ancient laws of her people.</p> 
               <p>Ardashir struggled within Orisa and forced her to face his suffering. Now, Orisa pretends to be same heartless merchant queen, but by night, word has spread throughout the inner sea region of an avenging angel, who seems to know all the secrets of the slavers he targets. The Shadow Angel is Orisa's body possessed by Ardashir's soul. He strikes slaving rings where they are most vulnerable and disappears into the night.</p> 
               <p>Lady Orisa works with Liberty's Edge, offering them information and secret financial support. In return, she asks for Pathfinder strike teams to attack slavers and those that protect them. She is a master of disguise who is careful to protect her cover identity and can even be found posing as a slave, following the trade routes to gather information.</p>

             <p itemprop="description">It has certainly been an exciting and successful launch for Starfinder and the Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild. With Gen Con 50 behind us, the Organized Play team thought it was a good idea to take a bit of a look at the organization that defines our living campaign: the Starfinder Society.</p> 
             <h2>Starfinder Society History</h2> 
             <p>Much of the established background for the Starfinder Society can be found in the <a href="/products/btpy9ssr?Starfinder-Core-Rulebook"><em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em></a> and the <a href="/products/btpy9vlp?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Guide"><em>Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild Guide</em></a>. Both of these resources provide overviews of the Starfinder Society, with the Roleplaying Guild Guide focusing more on recent events and serving as a direct lead-in to our current story line: the Year of Scoured Stars.</p> 
             <p>Sufficed to say, the Starfinder Society is reminiscent of the Pathfinder Society of old. In fact, much of the Starfinder Society is based on incomplete notes and hidden records relating to the Pathfinder Society. Both organizations are, for example, based around the concept of exploration, with the Starfinder Society having begun as a group keenly interested in exploring the mysterious event known as the Gap. The first Starfinders explored a galaxy made recently accessible thanks to the advent of Drift travel, seeking to chart the temporal edges of the Gap and figure out what they could about this setting-defining event. The audacity of such an endeavor brought many interested parties into the Society's fold, and during these early years, the Society flourished.</p> 
             <p>When it became evident that the Gap was not something that could be solved with a few decades of research, the Starfinder Society branched out to other avenues of exploration. They strove to reconnoiter the very fringes of reality and beyond, bringing back alien technologies and filling servers with the records of previously undiscovered species. This renaissance of exploration, involving far more organizations than just the Starfinder Society, brought with it a terrible price: the Stardust Plague. This pathogen slew millions across the Pact Worlds and led to strict quarantine rules for any operation partaking in extra-solar expeditions.</p> 
             <p>Expect to see more light shed on the Society's history (especially that of the Exo-Guardians faction) in this month's scenario, <em>Starfinder Society #1-04: Cries from the Drift</em>.</p> 
             <div class="blurb180">
              <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/StarfinderSociety/PZO7201-Chiskisk.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/StarfinderSociety/PZO7201-Chiskisk_180.jpeg"></a>
             </div> 
             <h2>Starfinder Society Leadership</h2> 
             <p>The Starfinder Society is divided into several tiers of leadership that largely departs from its Pathfinder Society predecessor. The various venture-captains form the informal base of leadership within the Starfinder Society. These experienced Starfinders tend to the numerous Society lodges in the galaxy and present field agents with their missions.</p> 
             <p>The Forum is an elected body of Starfinders that manages the Starfinder Society as a governing force, voting on the allocation of resources, the elevation of Starfinder field agents to special positions, and finally, holding a vote to decide the future direction of the Starfinder Society in the form of the First Seeker. Unlike the masked Decemvirate group from Pathfinder Society, knowledge of the Forum's membership is open information. Sufficed to say, several faction leaders, venture-captains, and even some notable Starfinders are members of the Forum.</p> 
             <p>The First Seeker is the elected leader of the Starfinder Society, and it's this person's proposed initiatives that shape the current overarching mission for the Starfinder Society. As we have discussed in <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ljyy?Faction-Overview-Second-Seekers">previous blogs</a>, the First Seeker gives us an in-setting reason to transition between the storylines our seasons present. When we had our first meetings about establishing what the various roles meant for the Society, I remember (alongside John and Tonya) explaining the First Seeker's term as being a temporary position, which they abdicate once their stated mission is complete. Many First Seekers have died in pursuit of their respective missions, and for those who succeed… well, that depends on the specific mission and temperament of the given First Seeker. In our final pitch for this concept, I equated a First Seeker's departure as being like the “The Long Walk” from a certain post-apocalyptic comic series—I think only Erik Mona caught that reference.</p> 
             <p>The previous First Seeker was a kasathan named of Jadnura, who led the Starfinder Society on its disastrous mission into the trinary star system known as the Scoured Stars. Following the disappearance of Jadnura, the Society held together under the leadership of its current nominated First Seeker, Luwazi Elsebo. Expect to see some movement on Luwazi's (as well as our overall season's) major storyline in next month's scenario, <em>Starfinder Society #1-05: The First Mandate</em></p> 
             <p>Finally, we have the enigmatic assembly of uploaded intelligences known as Guidance. This amalgam of uploaded Starfinder consciousnesses, makes its debut in <a href="/products/btpy9tsw?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-101-The-Commencement"><em>Starfinder Society #1-01: The Commencement</em></a>. Beyond its role in that scenario, as well as its current refusal to fully declare Luwazi Elsebo as First Seeker (she is only the nominated First Seeker, after all), there is not much to say about Guidance right now.</p> 
             <p class="tiny"><i>Insidious finger tapping...</i></p> 
             <div class="blurb180">

             </div> 
             <h2>The Lorespire Complex</h2> 
             <p>The Lorespire Complex is the home of the Starfinder Society on Absalom Station, not to mention the organization's primary base of operations. Thanks to the effect of the mysterious Starstone, Starfinders from across the galaxy can return to the Lorespire Complex in only a handful of days. Much of the Starfinder Society's success is directly related to maintaining this prime real estate onboard the Pact World's most important installation.</p> 
             <p>Countless chambers and meeting halls fill the Lorespire Complex, including well-known areas like the First Seeker Ilyastre Memorial Museum, or the formal Skyreach Room gala hall. The Lorespire Complex also houses countless Starfinders and visiting dignitaries in pristine dormitories. Beyond the eponymous spire, other structures cover the greater campus. The Archives contain the Society's incredible wealth of physical assets, along with vast data vaults ostensibly under the watchful eye of Historia-7 and her Dataphiles. The Hall of Discovery houses the elected Forum and First Seeker during their regular debates and meeting to steer the Starfinder Society. Other less known—or simply avoided—installations exist on the grounds of the Lorespire Complex, including the holding cells of the Adamantine Bastille, the mystical communication devices of the Communion Vaults, and the deadly proving grounds known only as the Perplexity.</p> 
             <p>Well, I hope that this additional insight into the Starfinder Society and its base of operations proved useful. I for one can't wait to share more news about our upcoming plans and scenarios in the weeks and months to come. Look forward to our next Starfinder Society blog, where I talk about a scenario that really proves why space can be a dangerous place...</p> 
             <p>Until next time!</p>

             <p itemprop="description">Look, I'm tired of trying to be the perfect hero. Ever since I started offering up my services—and working with a never-ending succession of random strangers—I've done the right thing, put others first, and bit my tongue, all without asking anything in return. And sure, the villagers I've saved have been grateful, and that's... nice. But whoever said virtue is its own reward never had to pay a bar tab. And hey, I do a lot of good in this world, from undoing ancient curses to putting down the world-ending-threat du jour, so why shouldn't I let loose on occasion? To be clear, I'm not talking about embracing some sort of chaotic neutrality in the name of being a jerk—I just want to be myself and get my due.</p> 
             <p>Lucky for me, I found this book, and it's full of antiheroes: folks who worry less about sanctimonious social norms and focus instead on turning their flaws into fortes. This is the kind of heroism I can get behind; to hell with all that dour do-goodery. Take the vindictive bastard, an ex-paladin archetype, for example: she lives up to the label (given to so many exes) by using her vindictive smite against those who've hurt her friends. Or the blatherskite, a gunslinger who runs away from danger faster than he runs his mouth—and that's saying something.</p>

             </div> 
             <p>Now, some of these antiheroes had it real bad in the past, giving them good reason to approach this whole adventuring thing with a chip on their shoulders. There's a multitude of backgrounds that result in the traits and drawbacks they carry with them today. Some were criminals, some get a raw deal in their dealins with a religion or some other group, and some have backgrounds that're downright tragic. But even these sad sacks can transform their personal tragedy into something productive (if unconventional): there are spiritualists whose phantoms draw their abilities from lifelong suffering, and there are bloodragers who summon the strength of a martyred ancestor to become an embodiment of righteous wrath.</p> 
             <div class="blurbCenter">
              <a href="/image/content/PathfinderPlayerCompanion/PZO9484-Backgrounds2.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderPlayerCompanion/PZO9484-Backgrounds2_360.jpeg"></a> 
              <p><i>Illustration by Forrest Imel</i></p>
             </div> 
             <p>Of course, treading too far down the path less traveled can get you in a heap of trouble. Before you know it, you forget why you're bending rules and start breaking them just for the fun of it, leaving yourself susceptible to corruption. Sure, you might get better at forging evidence and using forbidden magic, but you'll eventually end up overwhelmed by hate and turning on your closest allies. Happens all the time.</p> 
             <p>On the other hand, a lot of great tactics and tools are opened up to those who put aside the idea of a fair fight. Even when losing a brawl, you can accomplish all kinds of feats, like using your bloodied visage to sicken your enemies or taking someone down with you when you're tripped. And a swig from a <i>vial of reckless courage </i>will give you the temporary guts needed to face down the most horrific monsters. Or you can throw a portable hive at your enemies and let them explain a fair fight to a wasp swarm.</p> 
             <p>After seeing all the options available in this book, I think I've made up my mind—it's the antihero's life for me! But I'll tell you what: I leave it to fate to decide. I'll flip this coin, and if it comes up Desna, I'll start living life in the gray area between right and fun. Otherwise, it's the straight and narrow for me, I promise.</p> 
             <p>Here goes... </p>

            <div itemprop="articlebody"> 
             <p itemprop="description"><a href="http://paizo.com/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lk41?Sutters-Last-Blog">Last Friday</a>, James Sutter announced that he was leaving the Paizo family and moving on to focus on his writing career. We will miss James and wish him the best, so we decided to send Sutter off the best way we knew how—with embarrassing stories and photos—and the occasional heartfelt goodbye.</p> 
             <blockquote> 
              <p>My earliest memories of James L. Sutter are of a childlike gelfling spirit with an emo haircut, some kid recruited into Paizo through back channels by Lisa Stevens to fill whatever role she thought necessary at the time. These were the early days of Paizo, where our business was magazines and our org chart was a circle with everybody's name in it. Those without a specific duty inherited from our previous incarnation as the Periodicals Department of Wizards of the Coast tended to flit from job to job, doing what needed to be done, eventually accruing enough responsibility and expertise for a job description to calcify around previously unclaimed duties that had essentially fallen to the floor. James helped with some of the company's non-D&amp;D magazines, with customer service, and with getting Reaper miniatures uploaded onto the new paizo.com webstore, but he'd never really worked on the magazines I oversaw at the time. That all changed when we needed an assistant editor, and Sutter was only too happy to join our staff. In fact, this was about the same time that I formally became Publisher at Paizo, which netted me a private office down the hall and a tearful goodbye to the Editorial Pit, the tiny room that once housed our entire gaming-mag operation. Sutter himself sat in my old desk next to James Jacobs, and for a few years he even had to tolerate a couple of drawers filled with a half-decade of junk I was too busy (or lazy, take your pick) to clean out.</p> 
              <p>The young kid from the Seattle Stranger's editorial office took to the drawer-sharing situation with aplomb and a great attitude, traits that I would come to appreciate (and rely on) in the future. But then he was just Young James Sutter, an intern-made-good who frankly reminded me a lot of myself, and who, over time, I began to realize could have a huge future at Paizo. Once upon a time, after all, I had been the youngest guy on the D&amp;D team, and the youngest member of my creative team in the Dark Days of public relations, before I managed to turn D&amp;D freelancing into a career. And here, somehow, I'd found myself in charge of the whole editorial operation. What might the future hold for this ambitious young editor?</p> 
              <p>As it turned out, the launch of the Pathfinder RPG gave James plenty of opportunities to impress me even more. He'd already helped me (along with Pierce Watters and Chris Carey) run the editorial side of Planet Stories, Paizo's short-lived but much-loved classic sci-fi and fantasy reprint series, and with a new game coming we knew we'd need a fiction line to accompany it. Free web fiction, at first, but even at the very start I knew we wanted to have novels eventually, and that Sutter—already with a reputation as one of the strongest among a coterie of strong writers—would be just the guy to helm it.</p> 
              <p>There was only one problem. James Sutter was a rock star.</p> 
              <p>I don't mean a figurative rock star, like a guy who always overdelivers on his turnovers or an editor who routinely improves the work of some of the industry's top writers. I mean an actual, literal rock star for a series of local heavy metal bands that always seemed (at least to me and my fellow Paizo senior managers) like they were a lucky break away from making it big. I saw big things for James Sutter here at Paizo, but if he wanted to take advantage of them, he needed to go in with open eyes and every part of his being. We gave him a choice: Rock star or RPG star. James chose RPG star, and we've all been the richer for it over these past 13 years, during which James has been absolutely essential.</p> 
              <p>Like Golarion's star system? You can thank me for the idea of giving the planets equal treatment to the outer planes, but beyond a couple of tired pulp pastiches (my specialty!) of Mars and Venus, that's pretty much all Sutter.</p> 
              <p>Enjoyed the Pathfinder Tales line? Sutter wrote two of the novels himself, but he also edited every single one and contributed creative ideas to all of them. There literally would not have been a Pathfinder Tales line without him, and even now, as his days at Paizo dwindle into hours, he's still helping me find a new publishing partner to continue the line in the future, no doubt with future James Sutter Pathfinder stories yet to be told.</p> 
              <p>Enjoy the fun fiction bits at the side of the two-page chapter openers in all our hardcover books? James wrote about 95% of those. Love our comics? James wrote about a quarter of those, too.</p> 
              <p>Oh, did you like Starfinder? I put James in charge of Paizo's biggest product launch ever because of the success he had brought to all of those projects listed above, because he created the planets that form the core of the primary star system, because I knew he knew enough about the creative and business sides of publishing to make it work, and because I knew, after all these years, that he really was a rock star, and one that blazed with the incandescent creative power of a sun.</p> 
              <p>It turns out, after 13 years, that this rock star really cannot be contained by the band he's toured with this past decade or so. Having grown to something considerably more adult than a gelfling intern, Sutter leaves Paizo as one of its greatest champions, a face on a growing Mt. Rushmore of gaming whose contributions will last far longer than his time here in the office. You'll recognize his face on that mountain as the one with the expression of a master player in the middle of the sweetest solo he has ever played. Our rock star is all grown up and about to break out on a solo career. You'll see him out there in the wilderness at the center of the spotlight, with a legion of fans throwing the horns in his direction.</p> 
              <p>And you'll also see him here, in the pages of Pathfinder products yet to come and in the timeless creations he leaves behind. Pathfinder wouldn't be Pathfinder without James L. Sutter. Paizo wouldn't be Paizo, either.</p> 
              <p>So long, James L. Sutter. Thanks for everything you have done for Paizo, for me, and for all of our players and fans. I think I speak for all of us when I say we can't wait to see what you come up with next!</p>

              <hr> 
              <p>Once upon a time, there was a mystical, magical land called Jamestopia. Here, agents of Operation Banjo Thug wandered where they wished, content in the knowledge that their domain was protected and that the impromptu puppet shows they had become known for could be performed without fear. In Jamestopia, the view of the river was unparalleled, even if for some time the smell of sewage wafting in from sources unknown (likely other, lesser realms which didn't have the word "James” in their title) got distracting. And even when the world changed and we moved offices and Jamestopia fractured (AKA Sutter and I ended up sitting in different parts of the building), the concept of Jamestopia remained. Even when James Sutter drifted even further from the land of dragons and elves into the land of SPACE dragons and SPACE elves… the concept remained.</p> 
              <p>But now, Jamestopia has suffered a mortal blow, and there remains but one agent of Operation Banjo Thug to hold back the onrushing advent of the mundane. It's not going to be the same, representing the whimsical and nonsensical on my own.</p> 
              <p>There are a lot of fond memories, be they mice in the drawers or orange skin from too much carrot juice or adventures in creative sitting posture or impromptu discussions about the possibility of there being a space elevator somewhere in Varisia, and while Jamestopia is going away, those memories will remain.</p> 
              <p>I'll miss ya lots, Sutter!</p> 
              <p>And you DO REALIZE that now I get to do whatever I want with a certain LAWFUL EVIL gold dragon, right?<b> MWA HA HA HA HA HA!!!</b></p>

              <p>My first real encounter with James was when he reviewed my editing test for Paizo with me at a New Year's party (Seattle's a small world) while wearing a Steampunk officer's uniform and a sword.</p>

              <p>While his dress sense in the office is more conservative, he has always brought the same flair, sense of fun, and dedication to doing and being all the things all the time. Since that disconcerting day, James has been my peer, my boss, and then my peer again, but always a friend, a mentor, and an ally. We've commiserated about impossible deadlines and tough decisions, cried on each other's shoulders about family crises, and cheered each other's successes. Dude, I'm going to miss you here so much, so you'd better do tons of amazing things (including writing for us!)</p>

              <p>Sutter has always been friendly and upbeat, even during those unfortunate crunch times. If it weren't for him, I probably wouldn't be at Paizo, and I'll miss him sorely. Good luck out there, pal!</p>

              <hr> 
              <p>I first met Sutter at PaizoCon 2008, when I was still a "super-fan”, known for my message board handle and my involvement in the PathfinderWiki. I remember his enthusiasm when I showed him the print-on-demand paperback Pathfinder's Journal compilation I'd made to more easily read Eando Kline's adventures during my New York City commute. I like to think I was the inspiration for the Pathfinder Tales line he would eventually helm.</p> 
              <p>During that convention's Grand Convocation event, a bemused Wes sat at his assigned station, providing Harrow readings (with a glass of wine, of course) for eager Pathfinder Society players like myself. Next to him, over-the-top Sean K Reynolds acted out the part of a medium, channeling the gods in a live-action casting of <i>commune</i>. Enter Sutter, who had been lurking over Wes's shoulder as "Chumley”, Herr Schneider's loyal imp companion. When I approached Sean and asked him to channel Zon-Kuthon, Chumley took the opportunity to possess the open divine vessel and puppet him into giving me entirely non-Kuthite responses. Needless to say, the photos I got of Sutter manipulating Sean like a marionette were priceless.</p>

              </div> 
              <p>And the hijinks haven't slowed down ever since. Sutter has always been a constant source of new ways of looking at seemingly old, unsolvable problems, and has never been shy about his more eccentric personal traits—communal living, dumpster diving, and Star Trek body painted naked bike rides not the least among them. He's taught me a lot about the creative process, the logistics of getting books made, building one's online persona, and more. I'll miss him in the office, but know that as long as we keep putting out books about space and the First World, he won't be too far away.</p>

              <hr> 
              <p>Sutter's had my back since I first started freelancing with Paizo. He's always been tremendously supportive, encouraging, positive, and willing to take time out of his (incredibly busy) schedule to encourage and advise. He's a model for how to give credit where credit is due—though he really could stand to give himself his share of that credit. I'm lucky to have been able to work with him and even more lucky that I can count him as a friend.</p>

              <hr> 
              <p>Meeting James Sutter is like being swept up in a cyclone made of flashing neon lights, skydivers' screams, and pulsing electronic dance music: you have no damn idea what's going on, but whoa are things fun. Sutter's enthusiasm for everything creative immediately struck me the day I met him. Since then, it seems like the cyclone hasn't stopped, as we've worked on everything together from brainstorming Pathfinder canon to the massive undertaking that was the Starfinder RPG. As that project took shape, I also learned a thing or two about managing from Sutter, and the admirable depths of his experience for Paizo.</p> 
              <p>In the end, when push came to shove, I knew I could be my weird self around Sutter. And, I'll let you all in on a little secret: it's because he's weird, too!</p> 
              <p>Yeah, I know, Sutter. I'm <i>rude!</i></p>

              <hr> 
              <p>I've only been working at Paizo for a few months now, so I don't have the awesome, "way back when” stories that others are sharing. However, I did work with Sutter quite a bit for the marketing of Starfinder. I can say that there were evenings when I would burst into his office and say, "They need a 700-word article, in an hour!!” and Sutter would give me a look. The look was a combination of annoyed, tired, amused, and determined. In every one of those situations, I got the 700-word article with time to spare. The guy is a machine that creates and creates. It's been a blast working with him and he'll be missed.</p>

              <hr> 
              <p>When James L. Sutter started at Paizo, he looked like he was about 12 years old. To top it off, we already had a few James' in the office, so he got relegated to being referred to as Sutter or Young James. Well, Sutter eventually turned 21 and discovered the wonders of alcohol, and being 21 he also thought that he was invincible. And so the stage was set for one of the most epic nights of drinking the editors of Dragon and Dungeon had ever seen.</p> 
              <p>We in the developer's pit would sometimes take jokes a bit too far. Such was the case with our quoting of the Arnold Schwarzenegger classic "Total Recall”. Responding to any deadline with "Two Weeks" was common practice. Crying out like Arnold at any injury was accepted as normal. We enjoyed the flick so much that we thought it would be a great idea to get together and watch the movie, complete with mars themed drinks and food. Seeing as we are all gamers, I dug up the rules for a Total Recall themed drinking game. We gathered at Wes' place late one Saturday to partake in our favored film.</p> 
              <p>It all started great until we realized that drinking every time the word "recall” or "mars” was said was going to lead to disaster. Well, many of us realized that… but not Sutter. He vowed to keep pace with me, matching drink for drink. He was, after all, invincible, despite the fact that he was literally half my weight and about a foot shorter than me. As the movie drew to a close, I was quite tipsy. Sutter… well, Sutter was ruined. Incapable of coherent speech and unsteady on his feet, it was clear that he had drank more than enough. Soon after, it was Wes' kitchen sink that paid the price.</p> 
              <p>A lot has happened since those early days of Paizo. Sutter went on from editing dungeon to working on Pathfinder and eventually managing our fiction lines and overseeing the creation of Starfinder. He may not have been invincible then, but he sure seems like it now.</p>

             <p>The Dero Artillery, a small uncommon, is based off of art from the <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinder/adventurePath/strangeAeons">Strange Aeons Adventure Path</a>. I feel this miniature accurately captures the "only a little sane” aspect of dero. A note that this miniature and the dero magister will be changed to match the preexisting dero miniatures from the Shattered Star set, in terms of hair and skin color.</p>

             <p>Speaking of nightmare fuel, here we have the Pugwampi Gremlin, a small uncommon. This miniature is creepy because at once, I want to laugh at it, try and pet it, and run screaming from the room all at the same time. So much cuteness and homicidal violence in such a cuddly package.</p>

(I actually bought my first 3.5 rulebooks with the money from "Shut In," the first <em>Dungeon</em> adventure I co-wrote with Wes Schneider.)</p> 
             <p>It was a crazy time. All of us in the Editorial Pit were pretty much broke—until Paizo brought me on full-time, I'd been teaching SAT prep classes at night and living off some modest Wheel of Fortune winnings—but it didn't matter, because I was spending every day learning about games and world-building from my coworkers. Folks like James Jacobs, Erik Mona, Wes Schneider, and Jason Bulmahn, who remain in my eyes some of the world's foremost experts on what makes fantasy cool. We would argue furiously. We would go out drinking (once I finally turned 21, that is). We would occasionally all ditch work—with Lisa's approval—and go to the movies in the middle of the day. Wes would orchestrate elaborate pranks. Jacobs and I taped off our combined cubicle and declared it the Independent Republic of Jameslandia, within which he would draw me sticky-note cartoons or perform impromptu puppet shows with his collection of Godzilla plushies.</p> 
             <p>It was, in short, freakin' magical.</p> 
             <p>Smash cut to September of 2017, and I've been at Paizo for 13 years, almost to the day. A lot's changed. The company is huge. Pathfinder's a household name in RPG circles. I've run a novel line, managed critical teams through high times and crises, written probably millions of words about Golarion, and now find myself Creative Director of Starfinder—a game which, after more than a year of grueling (but exciting!) work, has just had one of the biggest launches of anything Paizo's ever done. Watching the frenzy at Gen Con this year, walking down the line signing autographs and chatting with folks who'd been waiting for two hours or more to buy the <em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em>, was one of the most satisfying moments of my career.</p> 
             <p>Which is why it's time for me to leave. As of September 12th, I'll be stepping down as Starfinder's Creative Director and resigning from Paizo to write full-time.</p> 
             <p>Sound crazy? Let me explain:</p> 
             <p>As a kid, I was heartbroken when Bill Watterson ended <em>Calvin &amp; Hobbes</em>. I couldn't understand how somebody could do such great work—work that touched so many people—and then just stop. In the last few years, however, I think I've finally begun to understand. By walking away when he did, Watterson ensured that <em>Calvin &amp; Hobbes</em> would never slowly slide into mediocrity. He'd never burn out and start to resent it. He gave us the best of what he had to give in that arena, and then he moved on. So even as I miss those characters, I salute his artistic integrity. And it's in that same spirit that I'm now leaving Paizo.</p> 
             <div class="blurb180">
              <a href="//static4.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/Sutter2017.jpg"><img src="//static4.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/Sutter2017_180.jpeg"></a>
             </div> 
             <p>I'm extremely proud of everything I've helped to create here at Paizo, but of course Starfinder is my most recent baby. While the world is just now getting its first taste of the game, the production times involved mean that we on the Starfinder team have been living it for a year and a half, and I've actually already overseen the whole first year of releases. But as much as there's still plenty more I'd love to explore with Starfinder, I can't escape the fact that I've been making RPGs at Paizo for my entire adult life, and it's time now to devote more than a few scattered hours each week to my other artistic loves—particularly fiction and comics.</p> 
             <p>Does that mean I'm done writing for Pathfinder and Starfinder? Heck no! If anything, I hope that no longer working for Paizo full-time means I'll have <i>more</i> time to write for both games as a freelancer. And while it's hard to give up Starfinder's captain's chair, I'm positive that Rob, Sarah, Owen, Jason, and the rest of the team are going to continue to take the game in amazing new directions. As both a fan and a freelancer, I can't wait to see where they go.</p> 
             <p>After 13 years, there are far too many people to thank, so I hope everyone will forgive me if I keep this short and just shout out a few of my fellow old-timers. To Lisa, who scraped together a job for an ambitious kid. To Erik, the editor-in-chief who slapped a copy of his own adventure "The Whispering Cairn" down on the new editorial intern's desk and challenged him to find things wrong with it. To Jacobs, for educational movie nights and teaching me what makes adventures fun. To Sarah, who taught me how to work well with artists, and Bulmahn, who taught me that you should never bring algebra to a drinking contest. To my longtime partner in creative crime, Wes Schneider, for always having my back and consistently forcing me to up my game. To Chris Carey for being my fiction buddy, and Judy Bauer for kindly but firmly teaching me to be a better, more mindful person. And to everyone else—thank you. There's no one here that I haven't learned from or laughed with at some point.</p> 
             <p>Last of all, I want to say one giant thank you to everyone reading this. I've always found the Paizo community unbelievably supportive, and for the last 13 years you've been the reason I'm able to live the dream. Whether you're one of the superfans who sent us pizzas during those first big Pathfinder crunches or a new friend trying out Starfinder for the first time—thanks.</p> 
             <p>All right, no more stalling. It's time for me to cue up the Annie Lennox track from the end of <em>Return of the King</em> and sail off into the west. I hope some of you will continue to drop in and say hi on my Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/jameslsutter" target="_blank">@jameslsutter</a> and my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jameslsutter/" target="_blank">Facebook author page</a>, or keep up with my latest work on <a href="http://jameslsutter.com" target="_blank">jameslsutter.com</a>.</p> 
             <p>It's been an amazing adventure. Now on to the next!</p>

              <div class="spoiler-text"> 
               <p><i>This program is designed to encourage players to reward retail locations that are providing space for Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild players. Locations utilizing the program should advertise its presence to their clientele. We realize that each location is unique, and has an overriding right to determine what is best for their business, so participation in this program is not mandatory. In cases where the specifics of the program don't align well with the retail's procedures (for example, if they don't provide receipts, or they run daily tabs), the event coordinator should work with the retailer to best approximate the intent of the policy.</i></p> 
               <blockquote> 
                <p>Game stores and other retail locations are an important part of the Starfinder Society community, and it's important to support them so that they continue to provide support for Starfinder Society play. Under this program, players can redeem receipts in exchange for modest benefits for the entire party.</p> 
                <p>Redeeming a receipt simply involves showing it to the event coordinator, who marks the receipt to denote that it was used. A player can only use a receipt in this way on the day of the purchase, and only for an event at that venue. The receipt need not include Paizo products—any products the venue sells count as qualifying purchases. Players cannot acquire or redeem receipts during their own turn or during any player's encounter; otherwise, players can acquire and redeem receipts during play only when doing so does not significantly disrupt gameplay.</p> 
                <p>If the combined value of the receipts redeemed by players at the table exceeds $10, all of the characters at the table receive the ongoing benefit described below, and each character chooses one of the single-use benefits described below. If the combined value exceeds $50, you may use the enhanced version of the applicable benefits instead. (In countries that use currencies other than US Dollars, use approximate equivalents of $10 and $50; don't worry too much about figuring out the exact exchange rate.) The ongoing benefit lasts for up to 5 hours, and each character may use their chosen one-time benefit once in each scenario played during those 5 hours. Characters can only receive the benefits once during any 5-hour block. No matter how many receipts the players have, the table can never use the same benefit more than once during a game session; they can, however, gain both benefits during a session.</p> 
                <blockquote> 
                 <h3>Ongoing Benefit (for all characters)</h3> 
                 <p><b>Harder to Kill</b>: Reduce the number of Resolve Points required to stabilize by 1.<br> <i>Enhanced Version</i>: Reduce the number of Resolve Points required to stabilize by 2.</p> 
                 <h3>Single-Use Benefits (each character chooses one)</h3> 
                 <p><b>Cheaper Healing</b>: Before the end of the session, you can use the benefit to reduce the Fame cost of purchases listed on the Basic Purchasing Plan boon* by 1 (minimum 0). Qualifying purchases include dispel magic, lesser restoration, make whole, remove affliction, break enchantment, greater dispel magic, restoration, regenerate, or raise dead.<br> <i>Enhanced Version</i>: Reduce the cost above the cost by 2.<br> <span class="tiny"><i>*Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild Guide page 27</i></span></p> 
                 <p><b>Recover from Wounds</b>: Anytime you spend a Resolve Point to regain Stamina Points through resting, you can recover 2 points of ability damage.<br> <i>Enhanced Version</i>: Increase the amount of ability damage recovered to 4.</p> 
                 <p><b>Bonus Wealth</b>: If you do not use the subsidized healing benefits above, you can instead choose to roll twice and take the higher result when rolling a Day Job check.<br> <i>Enhanced Version</i>: You also increase the credits you earn from the Day Job result by 50%.

               <h3 class="spaced-header-small">Promotional Bonus</h3> 
               <p>You have brought an accessory that displays your visible support to Paizo's organized play program. This grants you a skill bonus based on the faction your accessory promotes.</p> 
               <p><b>Prerequisites</b>: Bring and display a qualifying faction pin to the game.</p> 
               <p><b>Benefit</b>: Once per session, while wearing a Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild Faction Pin matching the faction your character currently champions, you may add 2 to any skill check. If you apply this benefit to one of your faction's favored skills, listed below, you instead roll 2d4 and add the result. For this roll you also treat the faction's favored skill as if you were trained, even if you don't have a rank in it.</p> 
               <ul>
                <li>Acquisitives: Bluff and Profession</li> 
                <li>Dataphiles: Computers and Engineering</li> 
                <li>Exo-Guardians: Athletics and Intimidate</li> 
                <li>Second Seekers (Luwazi Elsebo): Diplomacy and Perception</li> 
                <li>Wayfinders: Life Science and Survival</li>
               </ul> 
               <p>Alternatively, once per scenario, while wearing a Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild Faction Pin, you may add 2d4 to a Culture skill check. For this roll you also treat Culture as if you were trained, even if you don't have a rank in it.</p> 
               <h3>Promotional Convention Support</h3> 
               <p>You have brought an accessory that displays your visible support to Paizo's organized play program. This grants you a onetime boost of Hit Points during a scenario.</p> 
               <p><b>Prerequisites</b>: Bring and display an authorized convention support item to the game.</p> 
               <p><b>Benefit</b>: Once per session, as a standard action, you can heal a number of Hit Points depending on your Reputation Tier with All Factions. If your Reputation Tier is 0 or 1, you regain 1d8 Hit Points. If your Reputation Tier is 2 or 3, you instead regain 3d8 Hit Points. If your Reputation Tier is 4, you instead regain 6d8 Hit Points.</p> 
               <p><b>Special</b>: You can only slot this boon if the scenario is being run at the convention associated with the authorized convention support item. For an item to be considered an authorized convention support item, it must have prior approval from the Organized Play team. Event organizers are encouraged to email <a href="mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com">organizedplay@paizo.com</a> to verify the validity of convention items for this purpose.</p> 
               <h3>Promotional Record Keeper</h3> 
               <p>You have brought an accessory that displays your visible support to Paizo's organized play program. This grants you the ability to reduce the Resolve Point cost for a Stamina rest or to improve a starship-related skill check.</p> 
               <p><b>Prerequisites</b>: Bring and display a <a href="/products/btpy9tmp?Starfinder-Player-Character-Folio"><em>Starfinder Player Character Folio</em></a> to the game.</p> 
               <p><b>Benefit</b>: You can use this boon, once per session, in one of two ways. The first option is to reduce the Resolve Point cost of resting to regain Stamina by 1 (down to 0 RP). The second option is to reduce the DC of any single starship combat check (including a gunnery check) by 4; this decision must be made before making the check.</p> 
               <h3>Promotional Reroll</h3> 
               <p>You have brought an accessory that displays your visible support to Paizo's organized play program. This grants you a onetime reroll during the session.</p> 
               <p><b>Prerequisites</b>: Bring and display a qualifying t-shirt or messenger bag to the game.</p> 
               <p><b>Benefit</b>: You can reroll a single d20 roll you make during the course of the scenario. You must follow all the reroll rules as listed on page 243 of the <a href="/products/btpy9ssr?Starfinder-Core-Rulebook"><em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em></a> when using this reroll.</p> 
               <p><b>Special</b>: When a player uses a free reroll, she may present her Organized Play membership card (available on their <a href="/pathfinderSociety/myAccount/">My Organized Play page</a>) and receive an additional +1 for every GM nova she has earned, for a maximum of a +5. Note, this bonus applies to the higher result of the reroll, not just the second roll.</p> 
               <h3>Promotional Service Award</h3> 
               <p>You have proven your dedication to Paizo's organized play program. This grants you the ability to swap out a boon during a scenario.</p> 
               <p><b>Prerequisites</b>: Bring and display a qualifying campaign service award (i.e. campaign service coin or Wayfinder).</p> 
               <p><b>Benefit</b>: You can reroll a single d20 roll you make during the course of the scenario. You must follow all the reroll rules as listed on page 243 of the Starfinder Core Rulebook when using this reroll.</p> 
               <p>Alternatively, once per session, by spending ten minutes (including as part of spending a Resolve Point to regain lost Stamina), you can swap out any one boon for another boon that occupies the same boon slot. The boon you replace cannot be one with limited uses that you have already activated this adventure, though you can swap out a boon that you had to cross off your Chronicle sheet during play. You cannot use this ability to replace a slotted boon with a boon that uses up or take place during Downtime. You cannot use this ability if you've already used the reroll option provided by this boon.</p> 
               <p><b>Special</b>: When a player uses a free reroll, she may present her Paizo Organized Play membership card (available on their <a href="/pathfinderSociety/myAccount/">My Organized Play page</a>) and receive an additional +1 for every GM nova she has earned, for a maximum of a +5. Note, this bonus applies to the higher result of the reroll, not just the second roll.</p> 
               <p>This boon's second ability overrides the standard rule that once a boon is slotted it cannot be changed.</p>

             <p class="date">Thursday, September 7, 2017</p> 
             <p><i>This is the thirteenth installment of our strategy blog written by game historian <a href="http://erzo.org/shannon/index.phtml" target="_blank">Shannon Appelcline</a>. You can read all the installments <a href="/paizo/blog/tags/adventureCardGameStrategy">here</a>.</i></p> 
             <p itemprop="description">Great Pathfinder Adventure Card Game parties will have characters in different roles and will contain sets of powers that work well together. However, there are a few other characteristics you should consider when assembling a party.</p> 
             <h2>Vary your niches</h2> 
             <p>Make sure you have characters who fill a variety of niches. Choose some magic-users and some fighters; some characters who help with non-combat targets and some who support fighting; some who are great when grouped together and some who are great alone. You're going to face a variety of challenges, so make sure you have a variety of abilities to meet them.</p> 
             <p><i>Corollary #1: Especially vary complementary characters.</i> If you've chosen two characters who will often work together, try to make them as different from one another as you can.</p> 
             <h2>Vary characters by primary skills</h2> 
             <p>There are six dice-based skills in PACG: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Among your party, try to have good dice in each of these primary skills. If each skill is supported by at least one character with a d8, that's great; if your whole party tops out at a d4 or a d6 on something, consider how to fix that.</p> 
             <h2>Vary characters by secondary skills</h2> 
             <p>Here's a breakdown of the secondary skills and the number of characters in Rise of the Runelords who have each: Acrobatics [2], Arcane [3], Craft [0], Diplomacy [3], Disable [1], Divine [4], Fortitude [3], Knowledge [3], Melee [4], Perception [2], Ranged [1], Stealth [1], Survival [3]. (You could make a similar list for any of the other adventure paths.)</p> 
             <p>Ideally, you'll want each of these skills covered, meaning you can send <i>someone</i> to defeat each card and close each location. Absent that, choose characters that offer a wide spread of skills; work particularly hard not to add any characters to your party whose skills are totally redundant. Also, look carefully at the skills that are most common among the characters published with the adventure path you're playing, because they're probably the most important. The fact that none of the Runelords characters have Craft lets you know that you can get by without it. Similarly, missing Acrobatics or Stealth generally won't be a big deal in Rise of the Runelords, but you should think more carefully before voiding Diplomacy or Survival.</p> 
             <p><i>Corollary #1: Choose characters that have a lot of skills, especially if you have fewer players.</i> The fewer characters you have, the harder it is to cover all the skills. So for low player-count games, consider characters who have three or four secondary skills over those who have just two.</p> 
             <p><i>Corollary #2: Manage gaps with cards.</i> If you have gaps in your skill coverage, put cards that help with those skills into your deck. Just as a Masterwork Tools can cover a missing Disabler, a Burglar can help with both Disable and Stealth. (Remember which characters have those boons so you can send people where they need to go!)</p> 
             <div class="blurbCenter">
              <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6801-Burglar.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6801-Burglar_180.jpeg"></a> 
              <p>Sometimes you just need friends in low places.</p>
             </div> 
             <h2>Vary characters by cards</h2> 
             <p>There is nothing sadder in PACG than acquiring a great card and having to throw it out at the end of the scenario because nobody has room in their deck for it. This is also a pragmatic issue: You're only going to get so many great cards each game, so the more of them you can keep, the better your party becomes. So for each type of boon, you want at least one character whose deck list is strong in that type.</p> 
             <p><i>Corollary #1: Consider subtypes too.</i> Covering a range of card <i>subtypes</i> with your characters can be even more important. In particular, if you can have arcane and divine spell users, and melee and ranged weapon users, and characters proficient with both light armor and heavy armor, then you're more likely to be able to use everything you acquire. Certain characters can even be even more specialized: If you have the sword-wielding Kyra from the <a href="/products/btpy97ia"><em>Cleric Class Deck</em></a>, you may want someone who can use the great melee weapons that aren't swords; if you have Lirianne, you may want someone to take the ranged weapons that aren't firearms. (Of course that way lies absurdity; there will always be some cards you can't use, but minimize them!)</p> 
             <div class="blurbCenter">
              <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6802-KyraCharacterFront.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6802-KyraCharacterFront_360.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6817-LirianneCharacterFront.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6817-LirianneCharacterFront_360.jpeg"></a> 
              <p>Don't ask what happens if they find a card that has the Firearm trait <i>and</i> the Sword trait...</p>
             </div> 
             <p><i>Corollary #2: Consider blessings too.</i> Most characters tend to prefer specific blessings, either to complement certain skills or to overcome deficiencies in certain skills, or because their role cards provide benefits for using them. Try and spread these out too, so that you can happily use the maximum number of blessing types.</p> 
             <h2>Vary characters after the fact</h2> 
             <p>Sometimes, you can vary characters as they develop over time. Amiri, Kyra, and Valeros might initially all pick from the same set of weapons, but you might be able to specialize each during play, due either to power feats or to combos built by acquiring other boons.</p> 
             <h2>Take what you want</h2> 
             <p>You should never follow <i>any</i> of this strategy advice if it's impacting your fun, and that's especially true when you're picking characters. Yes, it's great to have characters that work well together, that can answer all of the game's challenges, and that make optimal use of your cards. But don't let it stop you from taking the character that you'll enjoy playing the most.</p> 
             <h2>Don't be afraid to abandon characters</h2> 
             <p>So you've carefully built your party... and you find out it doesn't really work. Two character powers clash (like Merisiel and Valeros) or two characters are fighting too much for cards (like Ezren and Seoni). Don't be afraid to dump one of the characters that's clashing and replace them, particularly if it's still early in the adventure path! The end result will probably be better play.</p> 
             <p>Choosing your party is just the first part of the metagame; how you improve those characters over play is even more important (and is the topic of the next article).</p>
