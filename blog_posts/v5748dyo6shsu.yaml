  \ was 5 or 6 years old, my Hebrew school teacher told me something I’ll never forget:\
  \ “Jews question everything.” You can see this philosophy in the constant back-and-forth\
  \ of Rabbinical literature throughout history, but even as a child, this stuck with\
  \ me (perhaps to my teachers’ chagrin). In many ways, this drive to find the answers\
  \ to hard questions has been a boon in my work as a TTRPG editor. </p> \n     <p>I\
  \ also owe more than I could ever say to my grandmother. She was forced to leave\
  \ school at 14 when the Nazis seized control of the Netherlands, where she was born,\
  \ and she went into hiding. She loves math and language, and I often wonder what\
  \ she would have done with her life if she had been able to continue her education.\
  \ In addition to being my personal hero and an all-around wonderful person, she’\
  s an avid fan of games and sports. Her skill at games continues even at her ripe\
  \ old age of 94: she solves 1000-piece puzzles by, and I quote, “remembering all\
  \ the shapes” and routinely mops the floor with my mom and her friends at mahjong.\
  \ She actually won’t play with the other residents at the retirement home because\
  \ they don’t “take the game seriously enough.” I figure she’s earned the right to\
  \ be a die-hard gamer at her age! </p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Jacob W. Michaels\
  \ (He/Him)</h3> \n     <p>Shana tova, Paizo community. I’m Jacob W. Michaels, one\
  \ of Paizo’s Jewish freelancers. I’ve contributed to a number of Pathfinder books\
  \ in First and Second Edition, and recently had my first Pathfinder Society Scenario\
  \ published (<em>2-19: Enter the Pallid Peak</em>). I’m excited to have my first\
  \ contribution to a rulebook, <em>Guns &amp; Gears</em>, out soon, plus the Kingmaker\
  \ 2e conversion! This is the time of year, as we approach the High Holy Days, my\
  \ thoughts turn to tikkun olam, the Jewish idea of repairing the world in part by\
  \ doing good deeds. Then, on Yom Kippur, we look at what we’ve done wrong over the\
  \ last year, and ask for forgiveness, not just from God, but from the people we’\
  ve wronged. I think it’s funny that for many of us, our gaming experiences match\
  \ these concepts. We like making heroes who set out to save the world (though, our\
  \ adventurers probably kill a lot more monsters than we do in our real lives). We\
  \ even may find ourselves atoning for our sins—literally in the case of champions\
  \ or other divine servitors who’ve upset their deities and lost their powers. But\
  \ of course, it’s so much easier in games, which is a shame. I imagine what this\
  \ world could be like if we could all try to live up to our best characters’ ideals.\
  \ Maybe we’re not killing a rampaging dragon, but even the littlest thing—let someone\
  \ into traffic, pay for a stranger’s coffee—can make a difference. If we can start\
  \ small, then we can work up to the massive things we still need to do to make the\
  \ world a better place. Be safe and be good, friends.</p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Hilary\
  \ Moon Murphy (She/Her)</h3> \n     <p>My name is Hilary Moon Murphy. When I was\
  \ growing up, my family told me in no uncertain terms: \"We are not Jews.\" This\
  \ was in a family where the adults spoke Yiddish amongst themselves (but never to\
  \ me) so I grew up understanding Yiddish as a second tongue. This was in a family\
  \ where I was raised by a woman with numbers tattooed on her arm from a concentration\
  \ camp. This was in a family where, one day, a family member started screaming when\
  \ a Nazi character appeared on a TV show and didn't stop until almost ten minutes\
  \ after the TV was turned off.</p> \n     <p>I believe that my family cut me off\
  \ from my Jewish heritage because they wanted me to be safe. They wanted to bury\
  \ their memories of everything and everyone they had lost. This denial was so strong\
  \ that I didn't start reclaiming my heritage until after I had children of my own.\
  \ There were tears on my face the first time my kids and I lit a menorah. I felt\
  \ like I was bridging generations, reaching out to all those my family lost and\
  \ saying, \"I remember you. I will not let you be forgotten.\"</p> \n     <br> \n\
  \     <h3>David Schwartz (He/Him)</h3> \n     <p>Hey! I'm David Schwartz, a long-time\
  \ contributor to Paizo. In case the name didn't tip you off, I'm Jewish (among other\
  \ things). Before I was asked to contribute to this blog, I had not really considered\
  \ how my Jewishness influenced my approach to roleplaying games. After much thought,\
  \ I realized that it can probably be summed up by my two favorite anecdotes from\
  \ the Talmud:</p> \n     <p>1) A non-Jew came before Shammai and said, \"I will\
  \ convert on the condition that you teach me the entire Torah while I am standing\
  \ on one foot.\" Shammai pushed him away with the builder's cubit in his hand. The\
  \ same gentile came before Hillel. He converted him, saying, \"That which is hateful\
  \ to you do not do to another; that is the entire Torah, the rest is commentary.\
  \ Go study.\" (Shabbat 31a)</p> \n     <p>2) The Mishnah states: If a fledgling\
  \ bird is found within fifty cubits of a dovecote, it belongs to the owner of the\
  \ dovecote. If it found outside the limit of fifty cubits, it belongs to the person\
  \ who finds it. Rabbi Jeremiah asked: If one foot of the fledgling is within the\
  \ limit of fifty cubits, and one foot is outside it, what is the law? It was for\
  \ this question that Rabbi Jeremiah was thrown out of the house of study. (Bava\
  \ Batra 23b)</p> \n     <p>You can find me on social media as davidschwartznz on\
