  artist: "Wayne Reynolds in the alternate cover to Pathfinder #1), but we didn't\
    \ want to stop there. Dragons are the name of the game, and we needed to make\
    \ sure that ours were distinct enough so that they looked different, but at the\
    \ same point they had to look like dragons. That meant horns, sharp teeth, long\
    \ necks, wings, the works. And further, we needed to know about their history,\
    \ gods, society, clans and bloodlines, physiology and psychology, language, variants,\
    \ and more"
