              <p>Hey everyone! James here, your favorite hapa senior designer on the Pathfinder rules and lore team. The month of May (at least in the US) is when we take the time to acknowledge and celebrate people of Asian or Pacific Islander heritage, and so we wanted to take this chance to spotlight our API authors as well as show off some never-before-seen art from our latest project to touch on these themes,&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Tian Xia</em>. Enjoy! If you like someone’s work, consider leaving a compliment to let them know or giving them a follow to keep up with their projects!</p>
              <p>Mahalo,</p>
              <p><strong>James Case</strong><br><em><strong>Senior Designer</strong></em><br></p>
              <h3>Eren Ahn (they/them, primarily)</h3>
              <p>Hello there! I’m a Korean American writer based in Chicago. Most of my personal work is tied to themes of identity, both as a person of color and as a person who identifies as LGBTQ+, and I draw on all aspects of my identity to drive my work. I’ll be collaborating with a good friend to produce system-agnostic supplements featuring original creatures and monsters for others to incorporate into their campaigns in the near future! If you’re interested in keeping up with that particular project along with anything else that I write, you can find me on Twitter under the handle&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/chromathesia/">@chromathesia</a>. You’ll also see some of my writing in both of Paizo’s upcoming&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Tian Xia</em>&nbsp;books.</p>
              <p><br></p>
              <h3>Jeremy Blum (he/him)</h3>
              <p>Hi, I’m Jeremy! I’m Taiwanese on my mom’s side and American on my dad’s. While I grew up in the United States, I spent the majority of my twenties living in Taiwan and Hong Kong, which is where I first got into tabletop roleplaying games. I was fortunate enough to channel some of my life experiences into the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Tian Xia World Guide</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Character Guide</em>, and I’m psyched to see what people think of my first major TTRPG project. Aside from reworking the Dragon Empires, I’ve contributed to the just-announced&nbsp;<em>Howl of the Wild</em>&nbsp;creature book, worked on Pathfinder conversions for the Korean mythology–inspired&nbsp;<em>Undying Corruption</em>&nbsp;project, helped the rad folks over at the&nbsp;<em>Asians Represent</em>&nbsp;podcast with their forthcoming&nbsp;<em>Wandering Blades&nbsp;</em>TTRPG, and dabbled in the world of wargaming with&nbsp;<em>Margrave: The Marcher Lords</em>. You can see&nbsp;<a href="https://pixelgrotto.carrd.co/">my full portfolio here</a>. When I’m not writing, you can find me on Twitter&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/PixelGrotto/">@PixelGrotto</a>, where I’m usually rambling about comics and obscure video games released two or three decades ago.</p>

              <h3>Alyx Bui (they/them)</h3>
              <p>Hi, I’m Alyx, and I’m a queer, disabled, non-binary, Chinese-Vietnamese Canadian and a TTRPG game designer, writer, artist, and GM, in addition to being an activist and filmmaker. I’m devoted to bringing more authentic queer Asian representation to the media and to play. I focus on stories that expand narratives divergent from the mainstream. I’m absolutely excited to have contributed to, and written for, Paizo’s upcoming&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Tian Xia Character Guide</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Tian Xia World Guide</em>!</p>
              <p>My first published work was a D&amp;D 5th Edition module in 2020,&nbsp;<em>The Great Zodiac Race</em>, an adventure that allows players to reenact the Great Race origins myth that determined the Chinese zodiac and lunar calendar. From there, I became a curated play program GM with Magpie Games, have contributed to thousands of dollars being raised in various TTRPG actual play charity streams, and am a board member for the Tabletop Mentorship program.</p>
              <p>Future projects I’m also excited to be working on: I’m currently developing&nbsp;<em>Chinese Ghost Stories We Tell Ourselves</em>, a communal horror tabletop roleplaying game based on Chinese ghost stories and cultural interpretations that lets players find out what ghost stories they’ll weave with their family.</p>
              <p>Why representation matters in TTRPGs is quite similar to why it matters in the media—when we don’t see ourselves reflected on screen or in the TTRPG world, it’s a signal that we don’t matter and our stories don’t exist. Our voices, our stories, our faces, and our beings will always matter.</p>
              <p><br></p>
              <h3>Dana Ebert (she/her)</h3>
              <p>Hi, everyone! I’m Dana Ebert, a Filipino American trans woman working as a writer and game designer. I’m also the creative director at TPK Brewing Co., a TTRPG brewpub opening soon in Portland, OR, which, I’m proud to add, is majority-owned by queer women of color and emphasizes partnerships with local vendors and artists. You can learn more at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tpkbrewing.com/">tpkbrewing.com</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.danaebertpdx.com/">danaebertpdx.com</a>. If you have a few minutes, please also check out&nbsp;<em>Firebrands+</em>&nbsp;on Pathfinder Infinite, as well as other titles by Team+. They do really outstanding work, and they’re just the nicest folks, for real. Cheers!</p>

              <h3>John Godek III (he/him)</h3>
              <p>Hi! I’m John, a mixed-race Filipino American gamer, Game Master, freelance author, and podcaster in the Seattle area. I earned my 5th Nova for Starfinder Society two years ago and started tabletop RPG freelance writing three years ago. I’ve written freelance assignments for Evil Robot Games, Legendary Games, and Paizo. My most recent work includes next month’s&nbsp;<em>Starfinder Society Scenario #6-04: Secrets Long Submerged</em>, this October’s&nbsp;<em>Starfinder Enhanced</em>&nbsp;hardcover, and next year’s&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Tian Xia World Guide</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Character Guide</em>.</p>
              <p>When I’m not playing, GMing, or writing, I produce four podcasts on the Know Direction Network:&nbsp;<em>Digital Divination</em>, a Starfinder show with Paizo Senior Developer Jason Keeley;&nbsp;<em>Intrepid Heroes</em>, a Starfinder actual play whose cast has included Eleanor Ferron, Rob Helm, Scott Keim, Ron and Stephanie Lundeen, Jason Tondro, and Mark Woolcott;&nbsp;<em>Presenting - Gamers Making Games</em>, an interview show where I chat with game designers, developers, artists, and editors; and most recently&nbsp;<em>Know Direction Beyond</em>, a Starfinder news, reviews, and interviews show with Alex Augunas and James Ballod.</p>
              <p>In my non-gamer life, I’ve been a university professor for 20 years, teaching entrepreneurship and social venture creation. Prior to that, I was a vagabond who sailed the seven seas—circumnavigating North America en route the Arctic Circle, Greenland, and the Panama Canal while also transiting the Patagonian Passage on the way to Antarctica, Tasmania, and Tonga.</p>
              <p>You can reach me on Twitter&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/JohnGodekIII/">@JohnGodekIII</a>&nbsp;and find my podcasts at&nbsp;<a href="http://knowdirectionpodcast.com/">KnowDirectionPodcast.com</a>&nbsp;or on YouTube at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsZdh4esq72zRKacIFyDSGA">GamingDivination.com</a>.</p>

              <h3>Jessie “Aki” Lo (she/her)</h3>
              <p>Jessie Lo, better known as Aki/Akino, is a queer, 1st-generation Asian Canadian game designer, writer, tabletop performer, and all-round TTRPG content creator. While she does too many things, you can find some of her best work on her award-winning Pathfinder 2e podcast&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/GobletsandGays"><em>Goblets and Gays</em></a>&nbsp;as well as her new all BIPOC Pathfinder 2e Star Wars Podcast&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/UnwaveringForce"><em>An Unwavering Force</em></a>.

              <h3>Adam Ma (he/him)</h3>
              <p>A writer and professional Game Master with a fondness for exploring personal growth, Adam is on an endless quest to create immersive experiences that push players to challenge the way they look at the world. Sometimes, this means finding opportunities to spotlight a culture, background, or way of life that isn’t often explored. Sometimes, it’s revealing a new terrible horror to bring to life at the table.</p>
              <p>As a Chinese/Puerto Rican living in Canada, Adam is a big fan of telling stories with diverse voices. Adam has contributed adventures, items, environments, and other worldbuilding essentials to Lion Forge, Splinterverse, and, of course, Paizo! Fans of Tian Xia will hopefully recognize his contribution, as dark humor and a deep love of horror tends to bleed into much of his work.</p>
              <p>When he isn’t crafting wordscapes in Tian Xia, Adam spends his time building worlds in any medium that will have him. He’s the author behind the post-apocalyptic superhuman webcomic,&nbsp;<em>Folklore</em>, and a contributor to a number of creative anthologies focused on everything from pirates to cyberpunk martial arts. His current major project is&nbsp;<em>Teldramir</em>; this open-play TTRPG world setting provides community adventures in a persistent world both for veterans and for players who are brand new to tabletop gaming.</p>
              <p>If you’re interested in learning more about any of his projects, be sure to give Adam a follow:</p>

              <h3>Christopher Rondeau (he/they)</h3>
              <p>Hello! I am a professor that primarily teaches writing and rhetoric. As an instructor, I aim to provide perspective on different voices through my student’s specific backgrounds and diverse reading options. However, my research is on interactive storytelling and how storytelling gives windows of opportunity for new voices. I had the privilege of being a full-time Game Master before moving on to an instructor role. Being a full-time GM opened many doors to the community, allowing me to become a writer on a few projects. You may have seen my name on the announcement for&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Tian Xia World Guide</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Tian Xia Character Guide</em>. Additionally, you can read my comic book and tabletop commentary on the Major Spoilers entertainment website.</p>
              <p>On top of teaching and writing, my company, Skald’s Tale Entertainment, is thrilled to be producing new actual play games in the upcoming months. My stories have a unique blend of my heritage. Being multiracial Chinese and Caucasian, I like exploring the multiethnic intersection within my stories. Check out the several projects set to release between May and August for your tabletop actual play entertainment by following @skaldstale on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/skaldstale/">Instagram</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/skaldstale/">Twitter</a>.</p>

              <h3>Ruvaid Virk (he/him)</h3>
              <p>Heyo folks! I’m Ruvaid, a first generation Pakistani American. I’ve had the pleasure of being a freelancer for Paizo since&nbsp;<em>Bestiary 3</em>. Since then, I’m proud to have worked on products, including the Fists of the Ruby Phoenix Adventure Path,&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Impossible Lands</em>,&nbsp;<em>Dark Archive</em>, as well as the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Rage of Elements</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Tian Xia</em>&nbsp;books!</p>
              <p>I’ve done a lot of work inspired by my South Asian heritage, but I still have some complicated feelings about contributing to something like this. Being a first-generation physically removed from my cultural roots is a difficult thing to deal with—darn that imposter syndrome! But I still love sharing stories and elements of South Asia, as I’ve done with my contributions of vishkanyas and parts of Jalmeray in&nbsp;<em>Impossible Lands</em>, and hope to do more in the future. I even run a homebrew Pathfinder 2e game set in Jalmeray!</p>
              <p>If you want to see more updates on my TTRPG work, or my other sporadic thoughts on stuff, you can follow me on Twitter&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/Darth_Ruvaider/">here</a>.</p>

              <h3>Grady Wang (he/him)</h3>
              <p>Grady is a gold Ennie–winning writer and Infinite Master whose work is in the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Tian Xia World Guide</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Tian Xia Character Guide</em>&nbsp;as well as the Season of Ghosts Adventure Path. He’s also a contributing author to the newly released&nbsp;<em>Battlezoo Bestiary: Strange &amp; Unusual</em>&nbsp;from Roll for Combat. Grady runs The Gallant Goblin along with his partner, Theo Thourson, which reviews TTRPG products on YouTube and publishes 3rd-party supplements, including the&nbsp;<em>Queerfinder</em>&nbsp;in-world–themed travel magazine series on Pathfinder Infinite. His other Pathfinder Infinite releases include&nbsp;<em>Cryptids Expanded</em>, a bestiary of more monsters for&nbsp;<em>Dark Archive</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Adventures in Jalmeray</em>, an anthology of three 4th-level adventures designed by an all-Desi writing team. The Gallant Goblin also makes adorable kobold plushies and, later this summer, will premiere&nbsp;<em>Love &amp; Hate in the Mana Wastes</em>, an actual play based on the Outlaws of Alkenstar Adventure Path featuring a cast of professional improv comedians and actors. You can find all Grady’s projects, shop for plushies, get notified of upcoming Kickstarters, and more at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gallantgoblin.com/">gallantgoblin.com</a>.</p>
