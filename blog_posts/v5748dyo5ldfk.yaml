  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Wednesday, May 9, 2012</p> \n   <p>You've probably heard\
  \ that Paizo is working with Goblinworks to produce Pathfinder Online, a massively\
  \ multiplayer online roleplaying game. Goblinworks has been giving you snippets\
  \ of our plans in the <a href=\"https://goblinworks.com/blog/\" target=\"_blank\"\
  >biweekly blog posts</a> on <a href=\"https://goblinworks.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\
  >goblinworks.com</a>, and we've been getting your feedback on the <a href=\"/paizo/messageboards/paizoPublishing/licensees/pathfinderOnline\"\
  >Pathfinder Online messageboards</a> here on paizo.com. Well, we're now ready to\
  \ kick off the next phase of Pathfinder Online.</p> \n   <p>Today we announced a\
  \ Kickstarter project to help us build the Pathfinder Online Technology Demo. Go\
  \ take a look at the <a href=\"/paizo/news/v5748eaic9pa9\">press release</a> or\
  \ visit the <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1675907842/pathfinder-online-technology-demo\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Kickstarter project page</a> to find out what this Kickstarter\
  \ is all about, and then come back here so I can share some details you'll want\
  \ to know. Don’t worry, I’ll wait right here...</p> \n   <p>...Did you read it?\
  \ Pretty darn cool, huh?</p> \n   <p>Goblinworks.com has its <a href=\"https://goblinworks.com/blog/index.html#20120509\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">own blog today</a> talking about the Kickstarter, so head over\
  \ there when you're done here for more details on that. What I want to talk about\
  \ here is the Thornkeep book!</p> \n   <p>Since the Pathfinder Online Technology\
  \ Demo itself isn’t something that we can offer to Kickstarter patrons, we had to\
  \ go outside the box for our Kickstarter rewards, and the Thornkeep book seemed\
  \ like the perfect answer.</p> \n   <p>Thornkeep has a Pathfinder Online logo on\
  \ the cover, but make no mistake—Paizo is handling this book just like any of our\
  \ other Pathfinder products. It's set in the very same world of Golarion as our\
  \ other roleplaying products, and contains 100% official Pathfinder campaign setting\
  \ material for use with the Pathfinder RPG.</p> \n   <div style=\"float: right;\
  \ padding: 0 0 .5em .5em;\">\n    <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/Thornkeep.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/Thornkeep_120.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n   </div>\
  \ \n   <p>The first half of the 64-page Thornkeep book is a Pathfinder RPG sourcebook\
  \ covering the town of Thornkeep and its surrounding area. Thornkeep is part of\
  \ the River Kingdoms area, which is the setting for Pathfinder Online. (You could\
  \ also drop Thornkeep into almost any wooded area in your own campaign setting.)\
  \ As we mentioned in <a href=\"https://goblinworks.com/blog/index.html#20121221\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">one of our earliest Pathfinder Online blog posts</a>, Thornkeep\
  \ is one of three starting locations for PCs in the MMO—it's the chaotic frontier\
  \ town that Ryan dubbed our \"hive of scum and villainy\" (think a fantasy version\
  \ of Deadwood). (You even helped us name Thornkeep in our <a href=\"/forums/dmtz4xx1\"\
  >first online poll</a>!)</p> \n   <p>We thought it would be cool to allow folks\
  \ to explore Thornkeep's various dark corners in their Pathfinder RPG sessions <i>before</i>\
  \ Pathfinder Online is released. We will be using this book as our guide when we're\
  \ building its digital equivalent. We're even going to have a small dungeon in this\
  \ book that will map directly to the one featured in the Technology Demo. So not\
  \ only will you be getting a guide to one of the towns in Pathfinder Online, but\
  \ you'll also be getting the first look at how content from the RPG transitions\
  \ to Pathfinder Online, as well as how content from the MMO might find its way to\
  \ your gaming table!</p> \n   <div style=\"float: right; padding: 0 0 .5em .5em;\
  \ width: 120px;\">\n    <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/RichBaker.jpg\"><img src=\"\
  /image/content/Blog/RichBaker_120.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n    <br> \n    <p class=\"\
  tiny\" align=\"center\"><i>Rich Baker, author of Thornkeep!</i></p>\n   </div> \n\
  \   <p>When we were looking for somebody to write the sourcebook material for us,\
  \ we went to our good friend Rich Baker. This is Rich's first time working on Pathfinder,\
  \ but he has been involved with classic D&amp;D campaign settings from the Forgotten\
  \ Realms to Birthright, and we figured it would be fun to see how he would approach\
  \ Thornkeep! I've seen his partial turnovers already, and they're awesome!</p> \n\
  \   <p>So what about the second half of the book? That's going to be a behind-the-scenes\
  \ look at the creation of Pathfinder Online, including excerpts from our internal\
  \ design document, plus design sketches and early artwork for the MMO, as well as\
  \ essays from Goblinworks and Paizo team members designed to give you insight into\
  \ the making of the MMO. Consider this a backstage pass to all of the goings-on\
  \ at Goblinworks!</p> \n   <p>Of course, we couldn’t have a cool product like this\
  \ without a Wayne Reynolds cover. The cover image you see here is a mock-up—Wayne\
  \ should have the real Thornkeep cover done by PaizoCon, and we plan to unveil it\
  \ at our banquet!</p> \n   <p>Thornkeep isn't the only Kickstarter reward, though.\
  \ There are lots of fun rewards for folks at all levels of pledge support! You could\
  \ even come to Paizo for a day, play a Pathfinder game with your dream Paizo GM,\
  \ and have a four-hour dinner with your GM, Goblinworks CEO Ryan Dancey, and myself.\
  \ Check out all of the Kickstarter rewards and help us get to the next step in the\
  \ development of Pathfinder Online. We wouldn’t be here without you!</p> \n   <p>Lisa\
