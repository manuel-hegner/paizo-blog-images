  alt: "A glimpse of the Saga Lands. The city seems to be hewn of stone, with two\
    \ fantastically gigantic statues guarding each side of this entrance. Each statue\
    \ depicts a person holding a long, thin staff in one hand, the top of which has\
    \ a kink in it. The other hand holds a large tablet close to the chest of the\
    \ statue. They are mirror images of each other."

  alt: "The Gray Maiden. A fully armoured warrior with a matching shield almost as\
    \ tall as they are. The shield is pointed at each end, edged in gold, and has\
    \ a rune in red across the front. The Gray Maiden also wears an armoured face\
    \ mask, a plume of red hair flowing from the back. Her cape is almost the same\
    \ color as her hair. She wields a long sword in her right hand."

    \ is dark brown and has been covered in red war paint across the face, legs, and\
    \ front. The long, curving tusks have runes carved upon them. The rider atop wields\
    \ a very long, thin pole arm."
