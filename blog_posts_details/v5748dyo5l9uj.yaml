  artist: "itself better or worse than another. It all depends on how that element\
    \ adds to the story being told. I have a graduate background in writing fiction,\
    \ but I was lucky enough to be in one of the few programs out there that didn't\
    \ turn up its nose at genre. And while I was in school, we talked a lot about\
    \ what it took to make a classic. Why was one book considered a classic, and another\
    \ not? The best answer I heard was Time. Because Dickens and Twain certainly weren't\
    \ thinking of writing literary masterpieces, at least no more than any author\
    \ takes pride in the crafting of words. No, they wrote for a popular audience,\
    \ their works by-and-large considered entertainment fiction by their contemporaries.\
    \ Now the classic science fiction and fantasy adventures we gleefully resurrect\
    \ at Planet Stories aren't written in today's styles. But there's a life in them,\
    \ a sheer exuberance of derring-do, that I often find missing in contemporary\
    \ fiction. Not that there isn't amazing stuff being written todayâ€”there will be\
    \ as many classics written this year as there were in 1939. But I think as we\
    \ go through these turbulent times of ours, we can benefit"
