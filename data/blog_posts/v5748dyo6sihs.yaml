  \ itemprop=\"description\">After the longest January in memory (seriously, I swear\
  \ it was eight weeks long), it’s now the shortest month of the year! Before you\
  \ know it, it’ll be March, then May… and then PaizoCon… and Gen Con… oh no, I have\
  \ so much to do. Can I have some of January back?!</p>\n      <p>We’re currently\
  \ recruiting GMs for PaizoCon Online and Gen Con Indy! Find more on that later in\
  \ the blog. As convention season begins to rev up its engines, we’re all very excited\
  \ for what’s in store!</p>\n      <p>In personal news, last weekend my husband and\
  \ I welcomed two darling kitties, Mochi and Sasha, into our home! They’re still\
  \ getting settled but we’re in love with them already. Sorry in advance for becoming\
  \ an Insufferable Cat Dad, it’s who I am now.</p>\n      <br>\n      <h2>Digital\

  \     <h3>Convention Recruitment</h3>\n      <p>2024 is going to be an incredibly\
  \ exciting year for Paizo. Be part of the excitement by volunteering as an Organized\
  \ Play GM at our Premier Conventions! Our volunteer GMs are the best of the best,\
  \ the cream of the crop, and the most helpful skittermanders in the galaxy. Last\
  \ year, our volunteers ran over 1,000 games online and in person, and we’re looking\
  \ to exceed that in 2024!</p>\n      <p>We are currently seeking volunteers for\
  \ our two Premier Plus conventions: <strong>PaizoCon Online</strong> and <strong>Gen\
  \ Con Indianapolis</strong>. Our friends in Columbus are also recruiting GMs for\
  \ <strong>Origins</strong>, which I’m thrilled to announce I’ll be returning to\
  \ this year!</p>\n      <p>You can get all the information in <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sihg\"\
  ><strong>this blog post.</strong></a> Spots are going fast, so don’t delay, apply\
  \ today!</p>\n      <h3>PaizoCon @ Your FLGS</h3>\n      <p>We’ve also announced\
  \ the locations for this year’s pilot PaizoCon @ program! Nine game stores, as well\
  \ as KublaCon in California, will be hosting PaizoCon events concurrent with the\
  \ online show. Check out <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sih9?PaizoCon-Your-Local-Game-Store\"\
  ><strong>this blog post</strong></a> for the locations, an interactive map and more!</p>\n\
  \      <h3>Interactive Special Presentation Survey</h3>\n      <p>As we start to\
  \ build out the presentations for our interactive specials, we wanted to take the\
  \ community’s temperature on how they’re working and what improvements can be made.\
  \ If you’ve played in any of our multi-table specials over the past few years, and\
  \ especially if you’ve been a House GM, we’d love to hear your thoughts in <a href=\"\
  https://forms.gle/LKevtTrXHX4HCW8d8\"><strong>this brief survey</strong></a>!</p>\n\
  \      <br>\n      <h2>2024 GM Boons</h2>\n      <p>With the recent influx of new\
  \ players, Paizo Organized Play’s biggest problem is that we simply don’t have enough\
  \ GMs to run games all the time. We’re always looking for ways to incentivize people\
  \ into the GM chair, and we’ve got a new one this year!</p>\n      <p>Below are\
  \ download links for two brand-new boons. These boons will unlock character options\
  \ as you GM games. While you can run games with your friends and complete the boons\
  \ that way, they will unlock faster if you GM at RSP-supported locations like your\
  \ local game store, or at conventions (like, perhaps…Gen Con or PaizoCon).</p>\n\
  \      <p>We hope that those of you who have yet to take the plunge into GMing find\
  \ this a great incentive to start, and that our long-time GMs are able to enjoy\
  \ the fruits of their labor. Make sure to tell your friends about the rewards of\
  \ GMing games for Organized Play!</p>\n      <center>\n       <p>Download the boons\
  \ here:</p>\n       <p><a href=\"https://downloads.paizo.com/OP-Files/2024+PFS2+RSP+Boon.pdf\"\

  \ href=\"https://downloads.paizo.com/OP-Files/2024+SFS+RSP+Boon.pdf\"><strong>Starfinder\
  \ Society</strong></a></p>\n      </center>\n      <br>\n      <h2>Sanctioning Updates</h2>\n\
  \      <h3>New Content</h3>\n      <p>New year, new sanctioning! We’re pleased to\
  \ announce that sanctioning for our latest two adventure paths has been posted:\
  \ Season of Ghosts for Pathfinder, and Scoured Stars for Starfinder. Long-time players\
  \ may notice that the chronicle sheets for the Scoured Stars AP look familiar; in\
  \ most cases, we took the original scenario chronicles and updated them based on\
  \ the new content. We’ve also posted boons and sanctioning for the two Dynamite\
  \ comics: <em>Pathfinder: Wake the Dead</em> and <em>Starfinder: Angels of the Drift</em>.</p>\n\
  \      <h3>Updates</h3>\n      <p>We’ve also made a couple of updates to the Character\
  \ Options pages based on the Remaster and new errata.</p>\n      <p>For Pathfinder\
  \ Society, we clarified that legacy bards can still use the Remastered feats in\
  \ <em>Player Core</em> with both<em>inspire courage</em> and <em>courageous anthem</em>,\
  \ to clear up that final bit of confusion. We also added a clarification to the\
  \ Curse Maelstrom archetype for those who have unlocked it via the GM boons. Finally,\
  \ it was brought to our attention that a number of 5th-level [Ancestry] Weapon Innovator\
  \ feats have been included in the 1st-level [Ancestry] Weapon Familiarity feats\
  \ in <em>Player Core</em>. Any character who has been affected by this may freely\
  \ retrain their 5th-level ancestry feat out of the Weapon Innovator feat into something\
  \ else!</p>\n      <p>On the Starfinder Society side, the recent Starfinder errata\
  \ allowed us to make a couple of changes. The chlorophyll infusion serum from <em>Starfinder</em><em>Ports\
  \ of Call </em>and the Forced Deconstruction mechanic trick from <em>Starfinder\
  \ Enhanced</em>are now permitted for use with the design team’s changes.</p>\n \
  \     <br>\n      <h2>GM Recognition</h2>\n      <h3>Campaign Service Coins</h3>\n\
  \      <p>This month, a new Campaign Service Coins was awarded! We award these coins\
  \ to members of the community who have gone above and beyond to provide an exceptional\
  \ program to the community at large. Campaign Coins are awarded based on nominations;\
  \ if you believe someone in your community is deserving of this award (whether or\
  \ not they are a Venture Officer), send an email to organizedplay[at]paizo[dot]com\
  \ with their name and reasons.</p>\n      <p>Congratulations to:</p>\n      <p><strong>Marc\
  \ Daoust</strong>, who now holds a campaign coin and OP ID #874</p>\n      <h3>GM\
  \ Ranks</h3>\n      <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in\
  \ any program involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the 5th milestone,\
  \ a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10\
  \ special scenarios as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains\
  \ (program dependent). A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th\
  \ milestone is 650 hours!</p>\n      <p>This month, we had two GMs earn their 5th\
  \ rank!</p>\n      <p><strong>5th Glyph (PFS2)</strong>: Federico Grecuccio (who\
  \ is the first GM I’m aware of to do their three evaluation games in three different\
  \ languages)</p>\n      <p><strong>5th Nova (SFS1)</strong>: Jake Rennels</p>\n\
  \      <p>That’s all from me this month, folks! Until next time—Explore! Report!\
  \ Cooperate! And stick around for a big announcement later today!</p>\n      <p\
