  \ \n     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">In the month since we\
  \ announced our latest class playtest, there’ve been rumors, speculation, and Pathfinder\
  \ fans across the internet connecting the threads of what the next book could be.\
  \ Appropriate, since I can now say that our newest rulebook will be the paranormal\
  \ <em>Pathfinder Dark Archive</em>, releasing at Gen Con 2022!</p> \n      <p>Golarion\
  \ is a fantastic world filled with the impossible. A city returned from the depths\
  \ of time. A chasm to the Abyss, only recently sealed. A fallen star granting godhood.\
  \ Yet even in a world where anything is possible, there are always further depths\
  \ and stranger phenomena on the fringes of understanding. The Dark Archive contains\
  \ material for players and GMs alike to bring cryptids, temporal anomalies, and\
  \ other paranormal phenomena to their game tables. And of course, two new character\
  \ classes that investigate the unknown: the psychic and the thaumaturge!</p> \n\

  \ <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Thaleon, the iconic psychic, and Mios, the iconic\
  \ thaumaturge. Sketches by Wayne Reynolds.</p>\n      </div> \n      <p>The psychic\
  \ is a spontaneous occult spellcaster whose magic comes from the unique interplay\
  \ of their conscious and subconscious mind. Do you see others’ thoughts as a precise,\
  \ ordered sequence, or do objects fly when you experience strong feelings? Whatever\
  \ kind of psychic you build, you’ll have a bevy of psi cantrips to cast at will\
  \ and to amplify with Focus Points for extra power or versatility. When the time\
  \ is right, unleash your mind in a storm of psychic magic—though beware the risks!</p>\
  \ \n      <p>The thaumaturge is the quintessential collector of superstitions: the\
  \ adventurer who’s heard every story and always has the right tool or charm for\
  \ any threat. The thaumaturge is in part a reconceptualization of the themes that\
  \ went into First Edition’s occultist class, so of course, you’ll have a mystic\
  \ implement (or three) to wield, along with the unique ability to identify and capitalize\
  \ on an enemy’s weaknesses. You can further customize your character with supernatural\
  \ tricks taken from all four magical traditions, warding circles, and even pacts\
  \ with powerful entities!</p> \n      <p>With two new classes, we also have two\
  \ new adventurers joining the ranks of iconic Pathfinder characters. While we won’\
  t be revealing their full backstories until the book is closer to release, I’ll\
  \ turn things over to their authors for a brief introduction:</p> \n      <blockquote>\
  \ \n       <p><b>Thaleon, the Iconic Psychic:</b><br> Thaleon is an artist whose\
  \ creative vision reaches beyond the physical world into unseen realms. Hailing\
  \ from Rahadoum, a land where religion is forbidden, he believes that effort is\
  \ the foundation of change and that each person has a duty to cultivate their own\
  \ talents and use them to shape society for the better. Thaleon embraces his ties\
  \ to the psychic forces that flow from his emotions and strives to understand them,\
  \ even as they sometimes surge beyond his control. </p> \n       <p style=\"margin-left:\

  \ \n       <p><b>Mios, the Iconic Thaumaturge</b><br> As a young adult driving their\
  \ night coach on the streets of Ustalav, Mios was attacked by a creature and afflicted\
  \ with a terrible curse. After hunting through rumors by the light of their coach’\
  s lantern, they managed to save themself by piecing together a cure. Now aged into\
  \ an experienced monster hunter, Mios believes in second chances but not third ones,\
  \ fearing neither evil nor death.</p> \n       <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight:\
