  \  <p>In the Starfinder Roleplaying Game, the discovery of the hyperspace dimension\
  \ known as the Drift has granted explorers access to a plethora of new worlds. Home\
  \ to many sapient species both peaceful and otherwise, Near Space is not a single\
  \ geographical area. Rather, it is defined by how quickly one can reach a world\
  \ using the Drift, which depends on how many of the mysterious Drift beacons are\
  \ nearby. One world might be virtually unreachable to another through normal travel,\
  \ but the two might be neighbors via Near Space and can therefore reach one another\
  \ in a matter of days.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"\
