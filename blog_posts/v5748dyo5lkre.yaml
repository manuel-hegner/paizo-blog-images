  \ \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">I'm currently neck deep in convention preparation\
  \ for PaizoCon, UK Games Expo, Origins, and Gen Con, as well as pulling travel plans\
  \ together for PaizoCon UK. So many spreadsheets! But I don't have them printed\
  \ out on my bedsheets (yet) so I think I'm still safe.</p> \n    <p>On the subject\
  \ of PaizoCon's—after holding PaizoCon Oz 2017 in New Zealand, the team approached\
  \ me about widening the locational mandate and rotating the event throughout the\
  \ greater Asia-Pacific region. Home office was happy to agree to their request,\
  \ so from here on out, PaizoCon Oz is now PaizoCon Asia-Pacific! I've got it on\
  \ good authority that they will release specifics soon. Hope to see some of you\
  \ in Brisbane, Australia, this October!</p> \n    <p>In March, we lost a dedicated\
  \ society volunteer to suicide. David Setty was a tireless GM and supported his\
  \ local community in Cincinnati with all his efforts. While you may not recognize\
  \ the name, if you attended Gen Con in the past few years, you probably saw David\
  \ GMing in the Sagamore Ballroom. He was the red-haired GM wearing a wide-brimmed\
  \ hat and a bright smile. In recognition of his importance to their community and\
  \ to raise funds for suicide prevention, the local lodge is holding the David Setty\
  \ Memorial Game Day. More information is available via their <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/375017789663174??ti=ia\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Facebook event</a>. You can help by <a href=\"url=https://afsp.donordrive.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=donorDrive.personalCampaign&amp;participantID=1550792\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">donating to their fundraising efforts</a>. If you aren't close\
  \ enough to attend, consider taking a moment to tell the people around you how much\
  \ you appreciate them. It may make all the difference in the world! For more information,\
  \ email <a href=\"mailto:brent1337@yahoo.com\">Venture-Captain Brent Bowser</a>.</p>\
  \ \n    <h2>Campaign Coin</h2> \n    <p>This past weekend, I attended Quad Cities\
  \ Gamefest in Davenport, Iowa. While there, I had the distinct pleasure of awarding\
  \ a Campaign Service Coin to an extremely active volunteer. During his tenure as\
  \ Venture-Captain of the Quad Cities Society, the group expanded and grew from the\
  \ base laid by the original venture-captain, James Martin. The recipient fosters\
  \ good relationships with game storeowners and works to help out in the greater\
  \ geographic area to expand Society to places that haven't had organized play before.\
  \ For their service and dedication to the growth of their community, we recognize\
  \ <b>VC Troy Schnack</b> with a Campaign Service Coin and <b>organized play number\
  \ 787</b> in recognition of his service.</p> \n    <p>If you know a deserving member\
  \ of your community, please email me at <a href=\"mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com\"\
  >organizedplay@paizo.com</a> with their name, location, and the reasons you feel\
  \ they should be recognized for their service. If you are able, please include what\
  \ events they may attend in 2018. This is especially helpful if they will be at\
  \ an event with a member of the organized play team (see further down the blog for\
  \ that list of events.)</p> \n    <h2>Stars and Novas</h2> \n    <p>This month we\
  \ only have one new addition to the 5-star GM roster. They earned the accolade this\
  \ weekend, making them the newest addition to the island. Huge congratulations on\
  \ achieving your fifth star.</p> \n    <p>To achieve this milestone, GMs facilitate\
  \ 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 are special scenarios,\
  \ as well as run a game for a venture-captain. A conservative estimate of time needed\
  \ to reach 5-stars is 650 hours! To the GM listed below, thank you very much for\
  \ the time and energy you spend running Pathfinder Society games! Your efforts are\
  \ greatly appreciated.</p> \n    <ul> \n     <li>Nick Sullivan</li> \n    </ul>\
  \ \n    <p>I've been watching the reporting data for Starfinder Society and we don't\
  \ have anyone approaching 5-nova GM status yet, but the team knows it is coming\
  \ soon. We hope to have more information in the next few weeks, as we keep discussing\
  \ both the nova requirements and the future of GM stars in organized play. Once\
  \ determined, we will include the information in a future update blog.</p> \n  \
  \  <h2>Volunteer Opportunities</h2> \n    <p>We still have badges and rooms available\
  \ for Gen Con volunteers. If you are interested in volunteering to run Pathifner\
  \ Socity or Starfinder Society events, please visit the <a href=\"https://goo.gl/forms/pxUyPSyeIK9dfwbl2\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Gen Con 2018 volunteer questionnaire</a> for more information\
  \ and to register.</p> \n    <h2>PaizoCon, Origins, Gen Con update</h2> \n    <p>Event\
  \ catalogs for PaizoCon, Origins, and Gen Con went live this week. If you want to\
  \ run a mid-slot game at PaizoCon, a limited number of tables will be available\
  \ for on-site signups. Origins offerings should be complete. I'm holding back on\
  \ listing the newest season of ACG launching at Gen Con until after the PaizoCon\
  \ Banquet, where we announce the new season information. So know there will be several\
  \ tables each morning and afternoon block of Gen Con that we have dedicated to the\
  \ new season ACG launch. We also haven't uploaded our seminar offerings and hope\
  \ to do that this week.</p> \n    <p>Badges for PaizoCon and Origins dropped already.\
  \ Gen Cons are currently ongoing. If you are expecting a badge and don't have it\
  \ by Friday, please let me know by emailing <a href=\"mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com\"\
  >organizedplay@paizo.com</a> with your name, paizo.com email, and convention you\
  \ are volunteering at.</p> \n    <h2>Convention Listing</h2> \n    <p>Hard to believe\
  \ we are almost halfway through 2018. Time is a flying! Never fear, there are plenty\
  \ of conventions scheduled for the second half of the year. I've updated the list\
  \ with all the event support requests I've received to date. All of the conventions\
  \ on the list maintain some type of web presence, be it website, social media page,\
  \ or Warhorn listing, so if you are interested in attending in either capacity,\
  \ check out their websites or contact the local venture-officer for more information!\
  \ If you know of a convention running Society games that is not on this list, encourage\
  \ the organizer to contact me at <a href=\"mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com\">organizedplay@paizo.com</a>\
  \ to discuss their event.</p> \n    <div class=\"callout-block indent\" style=\"\
