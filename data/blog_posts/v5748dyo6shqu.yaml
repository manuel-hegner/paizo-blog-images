  \   </div> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Veerkea’s life\
  \ began at sea. Literally, of course: like almost all ijtikris, she hatched from\
  \ a free-floating egg, grew as an instinct-driven larva for two years, and metamorphosed\
  \ into her adult, squid-like body before clambering to shore, drawing her first\
  \ breath of air, and searching for other ijtikris to adopt as her family. Yet, ijtikris\
  \ hadn’t ruled the planet Iji since ancient times, when the technologically superior\
  \ Veskarium conquered, annexed, and renamed the world Vesk-2, the first of many\
  \ conquests. So, when young Veerkea first peeked her upper eyes above the waves,\
  \ she instead spotted and reflexively bonded to a vesk squadron performing amphibious\
  \ landing drills along the beach. The vesk gave her a name and a hearty welcome,\
  \ delighted in teaching her Vesk profanity for the afternoon, and then transported\
  \ her to the nearest settlement on the isle of Ijahi for proper adoption, but Veerkea\
  \ vehemently and violently protested being separated from her new family. Impressed\
  \ by her outburst’s ferocity and considering this a sign the god Damoritosh’s favor,\
  \ the local commander allowed the new unit to remain together.</p> \n      <p>Part\
  \ daughter, part mascot, Veerkea thrived under her myriad parents’ tutelage. Her\
  \ formal education was straightforward: Veskarium lore, physical training, tactics,\
  \ weapon proficiency, demolitions, and field repairs. Wherever the unit traveled,\
  \ she absorbed languages, cultural norms, and local technologies even more quickly\
  \ than her basic foundation. In her final year abroad, the unit operated alongside\
  \ a predominantly shirren humanitarian mission on a survey of Swarm-ravaged worlds.\
  \ Where survivors held out, the joint operation provided material aid, spiritual\
  \ succor courtesy of the god Hylax, and assistance clearing out remaining Swarm\
  \ hives. Where none had survived, the operation catalogued the damage and whatever\
  \ remained of these now extinct societies. With each ruined world, Veerkea not only\
  \ grew more intrigued by the compassionate teachings of Hylax, the Forever Queen,\
  \ she also saw parallels between these ravaged planets and unanswered questions\
  \ she had about her own home world. Who were the ijtikris really? And what were\
  \ they like before the Veskarium invaded?</p> \n      <p>To their credit, both the\
  \ shirrens and vesk supported her inquiries. Her sergeant-mother, Bhaskeh, secured\
  \ her what scant imperial documentation survived the pre-Gap conquest of Vesk-2.\
  \ The more Veerkea read, though, the more the narrative fell apart, seemingly stitched\
  \ together by placating guesses from fifth-hand sources. Even the venerated poem\
  \ <em>Skyships Over Shallow Seas</em>, supposedly written by an eyewitness, began\
  \ with “The skyships arrived with the monsoon rains,” yet the planet had never experienced\
  \ seasons, much less monsoons. Veerkea had to learn more, and with Bhaskeh’s glowing\
  \ recommendation to their superiors, the ijtikri secured admission to the prestigious\
  \ Xakemath College of Cultural Studies on Vesk Prime. </p> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/40ecbb53-a04b-4b7b-be5d-0b7e60b51792/092021_Nanocyteiconic.jpg\"\

  \    </div> \n    <p>It proved a terrible fit. The social sciences had undergone\
  \ an uneasy revolution since the Silent War’s conclusion years before, but the Xakemath\
  \ College of Cultural Studies remained a stubborn bastion of tenure and tradition.\
  \ Its curriculum taught culture through the Veskarium’s lens: understanding Veskarium\
  \ cultures as they fit into the empire, identifying fissures in alien societies\
  \ to exploit during war, leveraging key cultural traditions in conquered peoples\
  \ to minimize rebellion and maximize harmony, and exploring ruins to salvage forgotten\
  \ technologies for integration into the military. In practice, Veerkea absorbed\
  \ few affirmative lessons from her required reading, instead treating each record\
  \ as another miscalculation in vesk xenoanthropology. Though she was too shy to\
  \ challenge her instructors’ lectures in person, her essays became increasingly\
  \ confident critiques of the field. Perhaps surprisingly, her instructors never\
  \ punished her dissident thoughts. Instead, her essays registered as heartfelt challenge—\
  like a young warrior boasting about her unbeatable combat style—and, by Damoritosh,\
  \ the best way to test insolent claims was on the battlefield! They had just the\
  \ site in mind.</p> \n    <p>To her surprise, Veerkea graduated with distinction\
  \ a year early, and with her diploma came her new assignment as archaeological consultant\
  \ to a military operation on a no-name planetoid along the Veskarium’s frontier.\
  \ The low-gravity rock was barren save for a crashed starship and the hundred soldiers\
  \ forming a perimeter around it, with heavy weapons trained on the wreckage. The\
  \ commander quickly checked her paperwork, asked if she was the negotiator they\
  \ were waiting for and, without waiting for her answer, called out to the soldiers:\
  \ “Make way! We’re sending in the archaeologist!” Giving her a datapad and a grim\
  \ salute, the commander wished Veerkea luck and pointed her to the wreckage.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>She skimmed files as quickly as she could—wreckage that seemed to predate\
  \ the Gap, advanced technology, initial successes by salvage crews…then attacks,\
  \ robotic clouds that shredded flesh from the inside out, and several skirmishes\
  \ fought to a stalemate. What a mess. She clambered inside through an airlock blown\
  \ off by Vesk ordnance and began exploring and documenting the mysterious starship.\
  \ Although unfamiliar, the technologies seemed intuitive, and she experimentally\
  \ flipped a few switches to check for power. Something awoke. Rushing along the\
  \ corridors, countless particles swarmed together into a roiling mass of nanites\
  \ that screeched an unintelligible challenge. Veerkea froze, wanting to reach for\
  \ her sidearm. Yet she spotted the bullet holes and triple gashes of doshko blades\
  \ here and knew that not only had the vesk tried combat and failed, but also that\
  \ her own methodologies were being put to the test. And so, she spoke.</p> \n  \
  \  <p>For more than an hour, the cloud and ijtikri spoke past one another, struggling\
  \ to find some common linguistic ground. She drew simple pictures on the datapad,\
  \ the cloud reshaped itself into simple pictures of its own, yet their slow progress\
  \ seemed only to aggravate the strange being. Lacking a better option, Veerkea sketched\
  \ Hylax’s sacred symbol. In an instant of apparent curiosity or recognition, the\
  \ cloud calmed, slowed, and approached. As it formed pseudopods to touch the symbol,\
  \ Veerkea lifted one of her own arms in greeting, and the cloud obliged by reaching\
  \ out to make contact. With a touch, the ijtikri’s mind swam with the cloud’s projected\
  \ telepathic thoughts.</p> \n    <p><em>“I am the child of a devastated world</em>,”\
  \ sang the voice, yet Veerkea thought the same words and knew them true of herself.\
  \ Again, they projected their thoughts at each other, each saying, “<em>Mine is\
  \ a history all have forgotten.</em>” A shiver rippled through the cloud, as though\
  \ it were confused or pleasantly surprised by how closely their thoughts aligned.\
  \ Embarrassed, Verrkea motioned for her strange friend to speak first, and the cloud\
  \ obliged, reshaping itself into hazy silhouettes of skylines, landscapes, and people\
  \ as it spoke. “<em>I remember so little: beautiful cities with soaring arches,\
  \ rolling hills rising above purple seas, creatures whose names I don’t know, people\
  \ with stories I have forgotten…and then here</em>.” The cloud stopped swirling\
  \ and reshaping. “<em>Alone. Homeless.</em>”</p> \n    <p>Veerkea’s eyes dimmed\
  \ with sadness, and she offered her own tale of conflict, devastation, and dogma,\
  \ yet also of compassion, camaraderie, and discovery. Of a young ijtikri who poked\
  \ her eyes above the waves and found an unconditionally supportive family…and she\
  \ ended her thoughts with “<em>Not alone</em>.” Less a statement of sympathy than\
  \ a promise. Sensing an invitation, the cloud washed over Veerkea, settling on her\
  \ before the particles painlessly melded into her skin. “<em>Not alone</em>,” it\
  \ echoed. “<em>Home</em>.”</p> \n    <p>Veerkea’s apparent victory impressed the\
  \ Veskarium, with her superiors equating her taming the nanites to a warrior taming\
  \ a wild defrex to use as a mount. However, Veerkea retired after only a few more\
  \ years, using her earnings to travel the stars and catalogue forgotten societies’\
  \ stories. Her and her nanites’ thoughts are as one, yet on occasion and without\
  \ warning, the cloud reshapes into some image as if reliving a forgotten dream or\
  \ channeling some omen from Hylax. Veerkea is quick to catalogue these strange clues,\
  \ certain that one day they’ll help her locate her passengers’ lost home.</p> \n\
