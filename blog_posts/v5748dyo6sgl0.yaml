  \ itemprop=\"description\">PaizoCon draws near, and that means we're approaching\
  \ our last month of regularly scheduled scenariosâ€”at least from a production standpoint.\
  \ May scenarios have to be ready extra early for PaizoCon GMs, June Starfinder Society\
  \ Scenarios have an early launch at Origins, July's adventures all have to be ready\
  \ early for Gen Con, and our Pathfinder Society scenarios have to be ready early\
  \ for Gen Con GMs. We've got a good handle on getting everything done by then. But\
  \ there's no denying that it makes for a stressful 6+ months of production, and\
  \ there are days when I'd love to retreat somewhere dark where I can just escape\
  \ it all for 4 hours.</p> \n    <p>Like the Shadow Plane.</p> \n    <p>Yes, that's\
  \ right. After a long hiatus, we're diving back into the Shadow Plane and picking\
  \ up loose threads tied to the Onyx Alliance, Blakros family, Blakros Museum, and\
  \ more in the Tier 5-9 <a href=\"/products/btq01x4s?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-1018-The-Daughters-Due\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #10-18: The Daughters' Due</em></a>. When agents\
  \ of the sinister Onyx Alliance begin appearing with equipment smuggled from the\
  \ Blakros Museum, it's up to the Pathfinder Society to find out not only how the\
  \ dastards did the deed but what villainy they intend to commit with these deadlier\
  \ weapons. This adventure's the First Edition capstone of sorts to an ongoing Blakros\
  \ tale that author (and Starfinder Society developer) Thurston Hillman's been spinning\
  \ since 2012 at least, and you're sure to see some of your favorite NPCs feature\
  \ in the story. And if you want more of the Shadow Plane in the meantime, you should\
  \ pick up <a href=\"/products/btpya1b8?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Distant-Realms\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Distant Realms</em></a>, which features Shadow\
  \ Absalom.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PZOPSS1018E-ChalosVisanda.jpg\"\

  \ adventure written by Alex Riggs, the PCs are called to the icy Lands of the Linnorm\
  \ Kings. The mighty Linnorm King Sveinn Blood-Eagle has declared that his long term\
  \ as king of Kalsgard is over and that he plans to sail for legendary Vallenhall,\
  \ but all is not right in his kingdom. With no clear heir to Sveinn's throne, his\
  \ unworthy children and their followers' brawl in the streets, leaving the town\
  \ guards with little time to spare.</p> \n    <p>These momentous events could not\
  \ come at a worse time for some of Kalsgard's smallest residents. As the Ulfen clash,\
  \ the gnomes of Kalsgard find that some of their neighbors are dying from a strange\
  \ disease reminiscent of the Bleaching. A gnome Pathfinder and priestess of Nivi\
  \ Rhombodazzle who calls Kalsgard home is positive that something less natural and\
  \ much more sinister is afoot, but she needs the aid of her fellow Pathfinders to\
  \ trace the true source of the deadly blight and put a stop to it. Perhaps Ellux\
  \ Shost's interrogation of a likely suspect pictured here will reveal some clues!</p>\

  \ the answers will not be so easily acquired, and the PCs will have to comb the\
  \ streets and alleys of Kalsgard to uncover what fell blight truly plagues the gnomes!</p>\
