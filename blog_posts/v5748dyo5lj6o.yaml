  /store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics/worldscape\">Pathfinder\
  \ Worldscape</a> sword &amp; sorcery crossover event hits comic stands NEXT Wednesday,\
  \ and I couldn't be more excited! As the series author, I had a chance to push the\
  \ series at New York Comic Con this weekend, and it was fantastic talking to so\
  \ many comics fans eager to see how the big event plays out! I signed a bunch of\
  \ Pathfinder comics at the Dynamite booth in my first-ever comic signing, and I'd\
  \ like to thank all of the Pathfinder fans who made it such a fun and welcoming\
  \ experience.</p> \n    <p>Before I get into this week's Worldscape Workbook, I\
  \ want to remind everybody that I will be appearing live at 7:00 PM at Meltdown\
  \ Comics in Los Angeles on Wednesday, October 19th, to celebrate the official release\
  \ of <a href=\"/products/btpy9oco\"><em>Pathfinder Worldscape #1</em></a>. If you're\
  \ local to LA (or so fanatical you're pricing flights right now), I can't wait to\
  \ see you at the event and chat about Worldscape, Pathfinder, Starfinder, or whatever\
  \ else you have on your mind.</p> \n    <p>Can't make it to Meltdown next Wednesday?\
  \ Can't make it to a comic store at all? Don't despair! You can <a href=\"/products/btpy9oco\"\
  >preorder</a> issue #1 right here on paizo.com. Or, to make sure you never miss\
  \ a single issue, sign up for a <a href=\"/products/btpy8tvw\">Pathfinder Comics\
  \ Ongoing Subscription</a>!</p> \n    <p>Each issue of <a href=\"/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics/worldscape\"\
  >Pathfinder Worldscape</a> comes with a bonus RPG appendix that translates some\
  \ of Dynamite's most important characters to the official Pathfinder RPG rules.\
  \ The first issue presents game stats for Red Sonja, the famous \"She-Devil with\
  \ a Sword\" who has served as fantasy's most ass-kicking female protagonist since\
  \ her comics debut in the early 1970s. Over the last several weeks, I've used this\
  \ Worldscape Workbook column to detail my thoughts on translating Red Sonja's stories\
  \ to the Pathfinder rules. I'll continue with other characters in the series—Tars\
  \ Tarkas, Tarzan, John Carter, etc.—in weeks to come, but I've still got at least\
  \ two more columns to cover before I'm done with Sonja.</p> \n    <p>Next week I'll\
  \ reveal an overview of Red Sonja's much-anticipated \"sword-devil\" archetype,\
  \ which allows rangers to swap out a bunch of their abilities to be more effective\
  \ combatants while wearing no armor. (I mentioned in comments recently that with\
  \ the Barsooman \"warlord\" archetype and probably a \"lord of the jungle\" archetype\
  \ yet to come, <a href=\"/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics/worldscape\"\
  >Pathfinder Worldscape</a> will be the \"Catcher in the Rye\" of no-armor martial\
  \ archetypes.) Before I get to that, though, we've got a bit more ground to cover\
  \ in terms of how I chose Red Sonja's equipment.</p> \n    <p>To recap previous\
  \ blogs in the series, I first decided that <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lj46\"\
  >Red Sonja's trademark \"chainmail bikini\" isn't armor at all</a>. I then tried\
  \ to figure out a way that <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lj5c\">her two armbands\
  \ might be important original magic items</a> before deciding, ultimately, to make\
  \ them <i>bracers of armor +4</i>.</p> \n    <p>Recalling the simple list of Red\
  \ Sonja's standard adventuring gear from <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lj5c\">last\
  \ week's Worldscape Workbook</a>, I knew that Red Sonja needed, at the very least,\
  \ a longsword, a throwing dagger, and a shortbow. While the origin story that ultimately\
  \ led me to determine Sonja was a ranger focused largely on her skill with a bow,\
  \ that story was weighted toward Sonja's rural upbringing as a chieftain's daughter\
  \ in the rugged Hyrkanian Steppes. In the modern day of the series, she's far more\
  \ often depicted wielding swords and fighting in melee rather than at range. Yes,\
  \ she often has a shortbow, and yes, she's very, very good with it, but a sword\
  \ is definitely her primary weapon. They don't call her the \"She-Devil with a Shortbow,\"\
  \ after all. So the shortbow was in, to be sure, but I knew I needed to put the\
  \ focus on melee weapons.</p> \n    <p>I knew that the sword-devil archetype I was\
  \ designing would allow Sonja, eventually, at least, to choose multiple ranger combat\
  \ styles. Because I wanted to build Sonja using the <a href=\"/products/btpy88yj\"\
  ><em>Core Rulebook</em></a> primarily, rather than choose from the large number\
  \ of ranger combat styles we've published over numerous books, that meant choosing\
  \ between archery and two-weapon combat. Given that archery seemed like a secondary\
  \ focus for Red Sonja, I decided to go with two-weapon fighting, even though Sonja\
  \ is most-often depicted wielding a single longsword in the 18 Gail Simone-written\
  \ issues I used as my primary inspiration for her game statistics. I also read dozens\
  \ of other Red Sonja comics while writing <a href=\"/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics/worldscape\"\
  >Pathfinder Worldscape</a>, and many of them depict Sonja with two weapons—most\
  \ commonly a longsword and a short sword, but also occasionally a mace, an axe,\
  \ or even a morning star. It wasn't a perfect solution given the source material,\
  \ but I liked a Sonja who is better with swords than bows, so I'm confident it was\
  \ the right decision. She'll get the archery combat style at 11th level, so it'll\
  \ all balance out in the end.</p> \n    <p>Additionally, choosing the two-weapon\
  \ combat style gave her access to Two-Weapon Defense as a bonus feat, which allows\
  \ her an additional +1 shield bonus to Armor Class. Even with the armor-assisting\
  \ archetype to come, Sonja needs all the help she can get in the AC department.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Sonja's swords themselves posed a bit of a problem. Unlike many fantasy\
  \ heroes, Red Sonja doesn't have \"a\" singularly important blade with a unique\
  \ name and history. The shape of Sonja's sword often depends on which illustrator\
  \ is drawing her, and seems to be more a matter of artist preference than any attempt\
  \ to hew toward a particular specific object. She most frequently wields a longsword\
  \ with a sort of upward-turned half-moon hilt, but even this appears and disappears\
  \ depending on her adventure. Further, while Red Sonja is definitely a formidable\
  \ warrior and it's easy to assume that her blades carry a bit of magic in the <a\
  \ href=\"/pathfinderpg\">Pathfinder RPG</a> sense, they don't burst into flame,\
  \ or talk to her, or float alongside her, or really do anything else to distinguish\
  \ them from other swords.</p> \n    <p>I therefore decided to give her swords a\
  \ simple enhancement bonus, +2 in the case of her primary longsword and +1 in the\
  \ case of her short sword. I made her shortbow a <i>+1 composite shortbow (+2 Str)</i>,\
  \ allowing her to add the +2 bonus granted by her 14 Strength to give her added\
  \ damage with ranged attacks.</p> \n    <p>All of that allowed me just under 3,000\
  \ gp left of her gear budget, which I dedicated to an item that allowed me to make\
  \ sense of one of the most confounding elements of Red Sonja's skimpy armor—<i>boots\
  \ of the winterlands</i>. I can buy that Red Sonja survives combats wearing next\
  \ to nothing because her near nudity distracts her opponents (the \"explanation\"\
  \ most often given within the comics themselves). I can buy that Red Sonja is such\
  \ a skilled warrior she doesn't even need to wear armor.</p> \n    <p>I can't buy\
  \ that she can survive in the winter wilderness wearing a metal bathing suit.</p>\
  \ \n    <p><i>Boots of the winterlands</i> allow Red Sonja to travel across snow\
  \ at normal speeds (her enemies constantly curse her speed, so that works), but\
  \ most importantly for my purposes, the boots warm the wearer as if protected by\
  \ an <i>endure elements</i> spell.</p> \n    <p>Both of the illustrations accompanying\
  \ this blog are by Jenny Frison, one of my favorite Red Sonja cover artists. I've\
  \ liked both of these covers for a long time, but with <i>boots of the winterlands</i>,\
  \ I no longer need to worry about how unrealistic it is every time we see her in\
  \ cold weather.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderComics/20161012-ColdSonja.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>A minor victory, to be sure. There will, I hope, be many\
  \ more to come.</p> \n    <p>Check back at this space next Wednesday for a full\
