  \ motley crew is me, <b>Jason Keeley</b>, Senior Designer and the design lead on\
  \ <em>Battlecry!</em> It all began with an idea for a book about the mortal wars\
  \ occurring in the wake of Gorum’s death and the eventual clash between Andoran\
  \ and Cheliax that is the Hellfire Crisis. While this is a book that focuses heavily\
  \ on fighting and has a lot of options for martial characters, I wanted to make\
  \ sure most other character types could join the battle. I wrote the guardian class\
  \ and the story of Arianna Dreth’s encounters with Ulka Oathshriek and Grimmyr (with\
  \ prodigious help from our more journalistic-minded editors). (Fun fact: The name\
  \ Arianna Dreth came from an anagram of “Dan Rather” with some extra letters thrown\
  \ in.) I’ve already been hearing a lot of positive buzz about the book—thank you\
  \ so much! You can find me on Bluesky <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/herzwesten.bsky.social\"\
  >@herzwesten.bsky.social</a> if you want to chat about games, books, and dogs!</p>\n\
  \      <p>Now it’s time for our battle-tested authors to sound off!</p>\n      <br>\n\
  \      <h3>Rigby Bendele (they/them)</h3>\n      <p>I was excited to contribute\
  \ the field propagandist archetype to <em>Battlecry!</em> Archetypes like the dandy\
  \ have always been my favorites, so it was a delight to put my spin on a similar\
  \ type of design (hat tip to the dandy's designer, Jessica Redekop!). I hope you\
  \ enjoy playing with it at the table.</p>\n      <br>\n      <h3>Tineke Bolleman\
  \ (she/her)</h3>\n      <p>Hi, I’m Tineke (she/her), and I’m from the Netherlands.\
  \ I have been active in the Paizo Organized Play sphere for years, and many of you\
  \ may know me from the Pathfinder and Starfinder scenarios I have written. For <em>Battlecry!</em>,\
  \ I brought many of the marvelous troops in this book to life for you. It was amazing\
  \ to work with others to bring you challenging and diverse enemies to face on the\
  \ battlefield. I hope you enjoy them!</p>&lt; \n      <br>\n      <h3>Jessica Catalan\
  \ (she/her)</h3>\n      <p>Hi, I'm Jessica Catalan (she/her), Senior Developer on\
  \ the Starfinder team here at Paizo, head of the Starfinder Society, and frequent\
  \ freelancer for the Pathfinder and Starfinder RPGs. For <em>Battlecry!</em>, I\
  \ worked on character options for existing Pathfinder classes, which is a space\
  \ I always enjoy exploring. I hope you enjoy taking to the battlefield as a summoner\
  \ with a swarm eidolon, a thaumaturge with a shield implement, or testing out some\
  \ new feats astride your beloved mount as a champion or cavalier.</p>\n      <p>Take\

  \ key part in armed forces before the advent of radio and more advanced communication\

  \      <p>Hi! I’m John! Besides <em>Battlecry!</em> I contributed to the <em>Lost\
  \ Omens Tian Xia Character</em> and <em>World Guides</em>, as well as over a dozen\
  \ other projects for Paizo, Legendary Games, Evil Robot Games, and Evil Genius Games,\
  \ including <em>Starfinder Society Scenario #1-00: Collision’s Wake</em>, a special\
  \ kicking off the release of Starfinder Second Edition at Gen Con this summer. For\
  \ <em>Battlecry!</em> I wrote the war backgrounds, magic armor, and battle vehicle\
  \ sections. As a veteran and former sailor, I am particularly excited by several\
  \ of the entries I contributed. I loved trying to capture the attitude of grizzled\
  \ soldiers with the veteran background, while the martial musician was inspired\
  \ by my time in marching bands and drum &amp; bugle corps. Working endless hours\
  \ in the frigid conditions of Antarctica inspired the creation of the <em>frost\
  \ furs</em> magic armor, while the <em>eagle wing</em> armor was something I wished\
  \ I had while flying in helos over Greenland translocating musk oxen. I probably\
  \ was most excited to bring the ice breaker into Pathfinder after working on three\
  \ ice breakers all over the globe! Look for me at Gen Con, or reach me at <a href=\"\

  \ For this book, I wrote the munitions master class archetype, as well as some magic\
  \ ammunition and siege ammunition. I'm really excited for folks to get their hands\
  \ on this book and to see what sort of epic adventures result! You can find more\

  \      <p>Now, I’ve been writing for Paizo for a while, so you might say I have\
  \ a bit of a reputation—the sort that leads our esteemed Jason Keeley to write me\
  \ out of the blue and ask if I wanted to write ten thousand words on military gaming.\
  \ I said yes. Actually, I think said something more like “YES!!!” Exclamation marks\
  \ were involved.</p>\n      <p>In my professional life, I teach a lot of military\
  \ history—mostly post-industrial stuff (ask me about trench warfare!), but I can\
  \ expound on most anything at least a bit. This was the perfect assignment in which\
  \ to inflict military doctrine upon an unsuspecting public, only with added reincarnating\
  \ harpies and depressed lich-queens. I hope you find it fun, I hope you find it\
  \ interesting, and hey, maybe even a tiny bit educational.</p>\n      <p>By the\

  \ Leigh Speedling, frequent contributor to Paizo. For <em>Battlecry!</em> I did\
  \ the guerrilla and Iridian choirmaster archetypes; I had fun trying to map particular\
  \ fighting styles and techniques to game mechanics and updating the Iridian lore\
  \ a bit for Pathfinder Second Edition. I hope people who liked sniping duo will\
  \ also like that one! I also got to do the whetstones, little magic items designed\
  \ to give martials something magical to do with their weapons in a fight. My favorite\
  \ is the <em>key of unwinding</em>, which lets its user rewrite time itself to avoid\
  \ enemy attacks. <em>Battlecry!</em> has a lot of other cool stuff in it, also,\
  \ and I'll be excited to see how folks use it in games.</p>\n      <p>If you're\

  \ I’m Linda Zayas-Palmer, former development manager of the narrative team at Paizo.\
  \ I’m now a full-time freelance author writing TTRPG content, primarily for Pathfinder\
  \ Second Edition and Starfinder. For <em>Battlecry!</em>, I wrote the follower rules,\
  \ including the captain archetype, as well as some of the new troops. Both sections\
  \ were good fun, but I especially enjoyed the process of distilling down the feel\
  \ of iconic character tropes into mechanics that fit into Pathfinder’s companion\
  \ framework. My most recently released work includes Pathfinder Second Edition conversion\
  \ of Palaeogames’s <em>Dr Dhrolin’s Dictionary of Dinosaurs</em> and the living\
  \ spell, bogey, and kraken ancestries for Roll for Combat’s <em>Battlezoo Ancestries:\
  \ Titans</em>. I stream twice a week on YouTube as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@arcanemark2562\"\
