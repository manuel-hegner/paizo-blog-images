  \    <p>The final chapter of Doomsday Dawn brings with it the final planned update\
  \ for the Pathfinder Playtest, Update 1.6, and it's a big one! Now, this doesn't\
  \ mean it's the last time we're going to tell you about changes and updates—far\
  \ from it—it just means that this is the last chance we have to make an official\
  \ update and ensure that all of you can access and use the updated rules in your\
  \ playtest games.</p> \n     <blockquote>\n      <div class=\"playtest-link\" style=\"\
  margin:2rem;font-family:Verdana;text-align:center;\">\n       <a href=\"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/paizo-images/image/download/PZO2100UE-1.6.zip\"\
  >Download Rulebook Updates</a>\n      </div>\n     </blockquote> \n     <h2>Stay\
  \ Classy</h2> \n     <p>Update 1.6 focuses on a variety of classes, in particular\
  \ addressing some of the systematic class-related topics you've shown us throughout\
  \ the playtest so far. This isn't the end of the story for any of these classes,\
  \ but they're the next step along the way, with some useful tweaks and additions\
  \ we'd like you to test. There's a lot, so I'll give a brief overview class by class.</p>\
  \ \n     <blockquote> \n      <h3>Alchemist</h3> \n      <p>First off, we've implemented\
  \ some of the alchemist changes originally seen in the Resonance Test, so the alchemist\
  \ now can use infused reagents to create alchemical items for free each day. Also,\
  \ many of you said that you wanted more versatility in building an alchemist who\
  \ might focus on alchemical items other than bombs, so we've given the alchemist\
  \ several fields of research specialization, as many players suggested. All the\
  \ bomb improvement class features have been moved to the new bomber research field,\
  \ and if you want to be better with mutagens, or healing items, or poisons instead,\
  \ there are research fields for those, too! Your research field grants you a variety\
  \ of benefits, including eventually being able to use Quick Alchemy for free on\
  \ select low-level alchemical items from your specialty!</p> \n      <h3>Barbarian</h3>\
  \ \n      <p>We've heard you say that the barbarian's rage is weirdly predictable\
  \ and static, so we're trying out our most experimental change of all: after each\
  \ round, you roll an increasingly harder flat check to stay in rage (don't worry,\
  \ it starts at 0, so you always get at least 2 rounds of rage). Let us know whether\
  \ this helps give rage the feel of a more uncontrollable and emotional event rather\
  \ than a predictable ebb and flow!</p> \n      <h3>Bard</h3> \n      <p>Thanks to\
  \ some extremely good dialogue on the forums about confusion with bardic muses and\
  \ their associated feats, we've revamped the way these are constructed. Now, each\
  \ muse's feats are limited to that muse, but we've added a new feat to let you keep\
  \ all the flexibility you had before. Taking the Multifarious Muse feat lets you\
  \ gain a 1st-level feat from a different muse than the one you started with, and\
  \ qualifies you to take that muse's feats in the future. In essence, this keeps\
  \ all the benefits of the old system without any of the confusion of the prerequisites;\
  \ plus, it's even more flexible if more 1st-level feats come out for any of the\
  \ muses later.</p> \n      <h3>Cleric</h3> \n      <p>There's only really one feature\
  \ for one class that you've all told us time and again is too much: clerics get\
  \ too many uses of channel energy. We've reduced that, but rather than leave clerics\
  \ hanging, we've instituted a change to somatic components such that you can now\
  \ perform them even with your hands full. This mainly benefits two-handed clerics\
  \ and weapon-and-shield clerics (as well as those types of paladins), who now don't\
  \ need to take feats specifically to avoid this issue.</p> \n      <h3>Druid</h3>\
  \ \n      <p>We've increased goodberry healing as well as animal companion Armor\
  \ Class opportunities (especially if you don't want to use a lot of barding). But\
  \ the biggest change for druid is a major revamp of the wild order. Once again,\
  \ this took a lot of data from you all; those of you who participated in forum threads\
  \ about the wild order will see that many of those ideas made it into this revamp.</p>\
  \ \n      <h3>Fighter</h3> \n      <p>Fighter is one of the classes that you've\
  \ been saying is in the best shape, but that doesn't mean there aren't changes to\
  \ be made. As a start of an examination on opens, we've separated stances from opens.\
  \ While you can still use only one stance per round, stances are no longer opens,\
  \ which means that you can stance up and follow it with an open. This change also\
  \ helps monks, though they have fewer opens.</p> \n      <h3>Monk</h3> \n      <p>Speaking\
  \ of monks, at your suggestion, we've increased the power of ki strike, but we've\
  \ also opened up other avenues into gaining a ki pool. Want some huge mobility and\
  \ defense rather than an offensive boost? Try Ki Rush!</p> \n      <h3>Paladin</h3>\
  \ \n      <p>This is a biggie. The numbers are in, and you've made it clear that\
  \ we should change the name of this class so that it can handle champions of deities\
  \ of all alignments, and have said that you want the lawful good version to keep\
  \ the name \"paladin.\" We haven't changed the class name just yet, but I want to\
  \ make it very clear to everyone who wants the \"paladin\" name to remain on lawful\
  \ good that this is only temporary for the purpose of making the update manageable—\
  we're not going to make you all go through your playtest books and change the name\
  \ of the class every time it comes up; we'll handle that for you in the final book!\
  \ The basic deal is that we've left the lawful good option—the defender—and also\
  \ added the redeemer and the liberator, who swap out the last two edicts from each\
  \ of their codes for some particularly neutral good and chaotic good edicts (instead\
  \ of the lawful good edicts to obey authority and act honorably). Each version keeps\
  \ lay on hands, but the three variants have different reactions, with the lawful\
  \ good defender retaining Retributive Strike. Speaking of which, we've revamped\
  \ Retributive Strike, allowing you to protect your ally within 15 feet even if you\
  \ can't reach them, and we've added a 1st-level class feat to let you use Step or\
  \ ranged weapons to counterattack on behalf of an ally within that range. There's\
  \ a bunch more feats supporting the new paladin versions too. Lastly, everyone now\
  \ gets the lay on hands upgrade that was in Hospice Knight for free, so that feat\
  \ is no longer with us.</p> \n      <h3>Ranger</h3> \n      <p>Everyone's presented\
  \ significant analysis on the pros and cons of Hunt Target toward various play styles,\
  \ so we've made some changes to give you more flexibility, while also making Hunt\
  \ Target less complicated at its baseline. Essentially, you choose what kind of\
  \ ranger you want to be, either making a flurry of attacks at your target, making\
  \ fewer but more damaging attacks against the target, or gaining advantages on a\
  \ huge number of skills against the target. Also, you can use Hunt Target in exploration\
  \ mode while tracking the target and have it ready ahead of time!</p> \n      <h3>Rogue</h3>\
  \ \n      <p>You've responded extremely positively to the three choices for rogue's\
  \ technique, so much so that we feel comfortable expanding them out. Now each rogue's\
  \ technique has a few technique-specific feats!</p> \n      <h3>Sorcerer</h3> \n\
  \      <p>We've added the diabolic bloodline into the mix for all your infernal\
  \ needs. Additionally, we're expanding the role of the sorcerer's 10th level feats\
  \ (which currently include only the 10th-level bloodline power feat) by adding a\
  \ feat that makes all your bloodline spells spontaneously heightened all the time.</p>\
  \ \n      <h3>Wizard</h3> \n      <p>Wizard is an enigma, ranked high for power\
  \ among the classes but the only spellcaster ranked as uninteresting; the other\
  \ four spellcasters top the chart of most interesting, followed by alchemist, while\
  \ the wizard is several classes down. We've decided to double down on the wizard's\
  \ role as the consummate flexible prepared spellcaster, basically, the character\
  \ who can think ahead and turn their ability to prepare and adjust for the situation\
  \ into a major strength. How? Well for starters, everyone has been loving the Quick\
  \ Preparation feat, to such an extent that we decided to just give it to wizards\
  \ for free! Secondly, at higher levels, we're adding some preparation flexibility\
  \ across your spell levels, allowing you to pull tricks like using up two of your\
  \ 5th-level spell slots to prepare a 7th-level spell.</p> \n     </blockquote> \n\
  \     <p>So what do you think? Let us know how these new adjustments have been playing\
  \ out as you finish off <em>Doomsday Dawn</em> and save Golarion, or as you run\
  \ any other playtest games. The playtest will still be open through the end of the\
  \ year, so don't worry if you haven't been keeping pace. See you Thursday for the\
