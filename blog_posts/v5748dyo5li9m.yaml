  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Monday, November 23, 2015</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"\
  > \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Just as many people consider one place home\
  \ no matter where they live now (every so often, I still find myself saying “home”\
  \ as shorthand for Georgia), I’ve met many gamers who have what they consider their\
  \ \"home group\" even when life’s circumstances and opportunities take them to opposite\
  \ ends of the state, country, or planet. Fortunately, the quality of low-cost virtual\
  \ tabletop programs and communication software improves every year, and it’s easier\
  \ than ever to run a game when friends are thousands of miles apart. Even so, there’\
  s something really special about reuniting the band in person.</p> \n    <p>My home\
  \ group first formed about 16 years ago—and I now realize has been together for\
  \ more than half my life—and has involved perhaps a dozen different players over\
  \ the years. We were always close, but we became especially close thanks to the\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety\">Pathfinder Society Organized Play</a> campaign.\
  \ Playing scenarios as a home group soon led to our volunteering at Dragon*Con,\
  \ after which we began serving as store liaisons and traveling a much broader convention\
  \ circuit as a team. When the final installment of the <em>Eyes of the Ten</em>\
  \ story was about to come out, Mike Brock ran us through all four parts in one weekend,\
  \ making us (as I still understand it) the first group to finish the entire series.\
  \ Together, most of us hit 5-star status, and even those who haven’t yet GMed selflessly\
  \ and ferociously at countless events over that 30-month golden age. As you may\
  \ guess the story goes, I was the one who broke up the band by moving across the\
  \ country to work for Paizo. Earlier in 2012, we had begun the “post-retirement”\
  \ tradition by playing <a href=\"/products/btpy8l3i?Pathfinder-Module-Academy-of-Secrets\"\
  >Pathfinder Module: \"Academy of Secrets\"</a> with Joe Caubo as our GM. About a\
  \ week before I flew out to Seattle, Georgia’s current venture-captain Dan Cornett\
  \ oversaw <a href=\"/products/btpy8j5y?Pathfinder-Module-Tomb-of-the-Iron-Medusa\"\
  >Pathfinder Module: Tomb of the Iron Medusa</a> as a last hurrah, and since then\
  \ we had wistfully wondered when our –1 characters might tackle <a href=\"/products/btpy8ssi?Pathfinder-Module-The-Moonscar\"\
  >Pathfinder Module: \"The Moonscar\"</a>.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n\

  \ dragon miniature Nani Pratt painted as their cake-topper are in the bottom left.</em>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>When two of the members Colin Webster and Jen Broyles first\
  \ announced their wedding engagement, we celebrated the happy development. As the\
  \ excitement subsided, it both shames and amuses me to say that we paused and then\
  \ simultaneously suggested reuniting our gaming group to thrash some demons on the\
  \ moon. Given they had first met at our Pathfinder Society game, it felt appropriate.\
  \ You can see some earlier pictures of Colin and me in a <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lbgw?Battle-in-Kelmarane\"\
  >blog that featured our Legacy of Fire game</a>—more specifically Nani and Kyle\
  \ Pratt’s amazing 3-D Battle Market.</p> \n    <p>We left the honor of recruiting\
  \ a GM to Jen and Colin, and they picked a winner: the husband-wife co-GMs Sterling\
  \ and Jessica Metz from the Georgia area. I had met both of them on separate occasions;\
  \ Sterling was at a game day I stopped by last December, and I had the pleasure\
  \ of GMing Jessica’s underfoot monk through part of <a href=\"/products/btpy8tb0?Pathfinder-Online-Thornkeep\"\
  >Thornkeep</a> at a convention this past January. This weekend they brought their\
  \ A-game by presenting high-level threats. They were also exceedingly gracious when\
  \ we routinely demolished whatever tried to hurt us. It was a great time, and we\
  \ all walked away with some great stories.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ and Jen Webster</em>\n    </div> \n    <p>Including Sterling, whose two natural\
  \ 20s in a row resulted in my alchemist’s first death ever. I understand he is currently\
  \ building a small shrine to house the die that killed the developer’s main character.\
  \ AC 55, Sterling! You’d think that would be enough!</p> \n    <p>Thank you to Sterling\
  \ and Jessica for running a great game and being patient as our characters wasted\
  \ countless hours catching up with one another, recounting past deeds, and reigniting\
  \ old rivalries. Cheers to our old team, whose characters have adventured together\
  \ for five years now. Congratulations most of all to my dear friends Colin and Jen\
  \ Webster.</p> \n    <p>Now just to figure out when we’re playing through <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8go0\">\"The Witchwar Legacy\"</a>...</p> \n    <p>Has Pathfinder\
  \ helped you reunite your dream team and spend time with cherished comrades? Perhaps\
  \ you’re participating in a play-by-post with old pals, or you met at Gen Con and\
  \ have always shared a table for the interactive specials. We often think of how\
  \ Pathfinder Society facilitates pick-up games, but I’d love to hear about how special\
  \ events have brought far-flung friends back together.</p> \n    <p>John Compton<br>\
