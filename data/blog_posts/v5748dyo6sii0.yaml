  \     </div>\n     <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\"><em>I begin my\
  \ annotation holding death between my talons. An overly poetic beginning, that,\
  \ and one I will certainly change when I report back to my Lady. Perhaps this a\
  \ consequence of reading the Godsrain Prophecies, each with its dire tale of the\
  \ death of a god and everything that comes after. I am reminded of the year I read</em>\
  \ What Comes Down: A Treatise on Mortal Falls <em>and used the word defenestrate\
  \ so often in my papers that Lorminos asked me to limit the word to once per page\
  \ at most!</em></p>\n      <p><em>As my earlier field notes on these works detail,\
  \ I learned of the Godsrain Prophecies not long ago, and have acted with great haste\
  \ to locate as many as possible, despite my many doubts as to their accuracy. I\
  \ must confess that I have also felt a certain unanticipated exhilaration in bringing\
  \ rigor to a rumor, despite the grim contents of the documents once discovered.\
  \ I believe that I may almost understand the impulse of adventurers (a mortal drive\
  \ that remains an obscure field of study), though I likely took as much joy from\
  \ detailing my methods as I did in undertaking them. Research rarely moves at such\
  \ a rapid pace, but then rarely has any researcher been so motivated!</em></p>\n\
  \      <p><em>What to make of these “prophecies” is a wholly different matter, and\
  \ one that I must settle before reporting to my Lady, lest I stir up visions of\
  \ doom with no attempt at context or framing, no better than a doomsday caller singing\
  \ in the streets! Any thought of these being accurate seems at first impossible,\
  \ given the current failure of prophecy overall, and their author has yet to be\
  \ identified. I immediately recall the many false omens in the years after Aroden’\
  s death, many of which had Golarion perishing brutally a thousand times (and will\
  \ one day, I assume, make for a fascinating set of studies).</em></p>\n      <p><em>Still,\
  \ there is something about these pages that makes me ill at ease. The detail, perhaps,\
  \ or the nature of the futures they forecast. This is heightened, of course, by\
  \ the subject of the first of them, which I hoped never to find but must still document\
  \ faithfully, as I have below. Perhaps the thing that troubles me lies in this simple\
  \ question: how do you tell your Lady that she’s prophesied to die?</em></p>\n \
  \     <p><em>—Yivali, Apprentice Researcher for the Lady of Graves</em></p>\n  \
  \    <center>\n       <br>\n       <hr width=\"75%\">\n       <br>\n      </center>\n\
  \      <h2>The Death of Pharasma</h2>\n      <p>When Pharasma dies, she dies by\
  \ inches. She grasps for a prophecy beyond her reach and the skin on her fingertips\
  \ blisters. She dreams the lost feeling of futures foretold and wakes with a tooth\
  \ ground to ashes. She feels an uncertainty chilling the air, and her bones grow\
  \ cold and brittle. <em>What changed with Aroden’s death? Why has prophecy faltered?</em>\
  \ The questions race and turn and tumble, edges carving at her mind as she tries\
  \ to judge the mortal souls whose futures she’s unsure of.</p>\n      <p>Is it any\
  \ wonder that she shatters?</p>\n      <p>The god they called Survivor dies alone\
  \ inside her palace—cold, exhausted, broken. No psychopomps to judge her works,\
  \ no Atropos to take her reign. Most of her servants lose their power in the instant\
  \ she dies, and no one comes to place her in a plane for all eternity. The fear\
  \ of how she might be judged has kept her upright more than once, but in the end\
  \ it’s simply this—she is and then she isn’t. Pharasma ceases to be.</p>\n     \
  \ <p>Death does not pause for the Lady of Graves. Death does not stop for anyone.\
  \ Mortals succumb to the usual things—some in the arms of those who loved them,\
  \ some at the hands of those who did not. Some in a show of bravery, some in a haze\
  \ of regret, some drenched hot with sweat or fear or love or loss or anger. All\
  \ plunge into the River of Souls like jagged rocks sent tumbling, leaving eddies\
  \ in their wake that shift and roil the current. The river churns with energy, a\
  \ swirling froth of rapids, throwing souls from in its midst with no set rhyme or\
  \ reason. The guardians who watch it pass are nothing more than onlookers, as this\
  \ soul bound for Heaven is shunted off to Abaddon, and that one at the brink of\
  \ Hell is flung into Nirvana. With souls no longer guided to the places where they’\
  re most aligned, the outer planes turn turbulent, splintering to factions where\
  \ they once found harmony. Fights break out, and rescue missions; pacts and trades\
  \ and promises no sooner made than torn apart—a muddied bloodied mess of souls askew\
  \ for all eternity.</p>\n      <p>Pharasma’s former psychopomps, distracted by the\
  \ chaos or the torrents of the river or the sorrow of their grief, rarely see the\
  \ predators who feast within the river’s wake—daemons and worse who grab souls up\
  \ by the handful, taking them to sell or gift or simply disappear with.</p>\n  \
  \    <p>Among the mortals, resurrections now begin to falter, as souls are often\
  \ missing from the places where they’re sought. Even for those who never cared a\
  \ moment for Pharasmin things, the new finality of death leaves many saying prayers\
  \ for Pharasma, desperate for a sign that she might one day still reach out.</p>\n\
  \      <p>Her followers are hardest hit—the clerics and diviners, the midwives and\
  \ morticians—their boons no longer functioning, their spells bereft of power. Those\
  \ who battle the undead see their advantage dissipate, and some who cannot fight\
  \ or flee fall easily to undead foes, their victories turned to slaughters in a\
  \ hundred grim tableaus.</p>\n      <p>Urgathoa laughs, heartily, to see a foe defeated,\
  \ declaring 50 days of feasts and manifesting blood-soaked wine in any empty cup.\
  \ She calls upon her followers to press their new advantages, as those who fought\
  \ her worshippers are left to face a reckoning—some turning to another god whose\
  \ purpose fits their calling, some searching for a prophecy or ritual or sacrifice\
  \ that might bring back Pharasma and the surety she gave them, some finding other\
  \ pledges for their cause.</p>\n      <p>Above it all, a visage hangs and grins\
  \ upon the chaos—Groetus watching eagerly from just above the Spire. Some say the\
  \ crescent of his moon begins to wax in earnest, as we move ever closer to the end\
  \ times he desires.</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/58a6ebd8-0b5c-47b1-b5d6-881c43f2deee/EvolvingProhecyImage_Wk1_1300x2000.jpg\"\

  \ to note the cause of my Lady’s death as indirectly caused by the end of prophecy.\
