  description\">With the exception a few summer conventions releases, scenarios traditionally\
  \ come out on the last Wednesday of the month. This time that's December 31st, which\
  \ probably makes these adventures feel less like the December 2014 scenarios and\
  \ more like a capstone to an exciting year of <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety\">Pathfinder\
  \ Society Organized Play</a> plus a wonderful ringing in of the new yearâ€”at least\
  \ that's how I'm going to brand it. Both adventures start with time-honored, familiar\
  \ concepts from 2014 and while pursuing new plots that make 2015 particularly worth\
  \ celebrating.</p> \n    <p>One of the Society's old friends (and I use the term\
  \ loosely) resurfaced earlier in the season while Pathfinder agents investigated\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9985\">a case of magical espionage in Absalom</a>. Venture-Captain\
  \ Ambrus Valsin believes any threat to the city is a threat to the Society, and\
  \ an ally has since divined the the source of these incursions: Stonespine Island,\
  \ home to the infamous Okeno pirates and a generous helping of gnolls. In <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9a1z\"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #6-11: The Slave Master's Mirror</em></a>,\
  \ author Sam Polak sends the PCs through one of the most notorious slaver cities\
  \ on Golarion and into the rugged wilds to put an end to this villain's plans.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Just over a year ago, new initiates to the Society received a replayable\
  \ opportunity to learn what it really means to be a Pathfinder in <a href=\"/products/btpy92ci\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #5-08: The Confirmation</em></a>. It remains one\
  \ of the most popular scenarios published to date, and it quickly became apparent\
  \ that I should schedule a second Tier 1-2 adventure for release in Season 6. Back\
  \ in the spring, Mark Moreland and I concocted a basic outline that could match\
  \ The Confirmation's excellence, introduce newer players to another central feature\
  \ of the Society, and provide opportunities for replay with a different experience\
  \ each time. At PaizoCon, I pitched the idea to the author I knew could handle such\
  \ a challenge: Thurston Hillman. After months of bouncing ideas off each other,\
  \ I wrote a final outline, sent it off, and let Thursty run with it. The result\
  \ is <a href=\"/products/btpy9a1y\"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #6-10: The Wounded\
  \ Wisp</em></a>, a mundane assignment that quickly spirals into a gripping investigation\
  \ of the Pathfinder Society's past that takes the PCs to some of the Society's and\
  \ Absalom's most famous sites in pursuit of centuries-old secrets from the Grand\
  \ Lodge's darkest days. It dovetails nicely with The Confirmation, serving as a\
  \ great prelude, sequel, or even standalone adventure.</p> \n    <p>This weekend\
  \ I had the pleasure of being back in Georgia for the recent holiday and visiting\
  \ a few of the GeorgiaPFS events. I can proudly report that my 7th-level warpriest\
  \ pregenerated character had a blast in <a href=\"/products/btpy8u8s\"><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Society Scenario #4-06: The Green Market</em></a>, and the ranger Agna has finally\
  \ dispatched the first of her many pirate rivals in <a href=\"/pfsacg\">the Pathfinder\
  \ Society Adventure Card Guild</a> adventures. I hope that everyone else's end of\
  \ year has been as satisfying.</p> \n    <p>John Compton<br> <i>Developer</i></p>\
