  \ keeping one eye on the woman. She looked pale with illness and the constant clearing\
  \ of her throat did nothing to disprove the notion. She gave him a weak smile, more\
  \ grimace than grin. He continued leafing through the report.</p> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/ed3a107c-6971-4b08-b672-04649732c43c/073020_toulonvidoc.jpg\"\

  \ they’re all connected, Miss…”</p> \n     <p>“Ah, it’s Mrs. Kavint. Roverrint may\
  \ be gone, gods bless him, but he lives on in my heart and in my mind and I remain\
  \ a faithful woman.” Another grimace. “Yes, I’ve done the work to prove everything\
  \ that I can to show that—”</p> \n     <p>“You understand that you’re accusing Queen\
  \ Abrogail of high treason,” Toulon interrupted, “and that such accusations don’\
  t come lightly, right?”</p> \n     <p>“Y-yes, very much sir, but it’s all there!\
  \ The Queen sent her foolish cousin to incite the rebellion in Kintargo while secretly\
  \ supplying the rebels with weapons and supplies. It was her idea to destroy the\
  \ Menador Keep! Do you think the rebels had the means to do that on their own? Of\
  \ course not! And then I heard that one of those other Hellknights used it as a\
  \ cover to fake her death. Trust me. I’ve found the connections and I can see…”\
  </p> \n     <p>“Mrs. Kavint, that’s quite enough. I believe you. This evidence isn’\
  t airtight, but there’s a lot here we can work with.” Toulon stood from his desk\
  \ and walked to the door. “I greatly appreciate you bringing this to our attention,\
  \ and I promise to put our resources toward investigating this further. I’ll have\
  \ one of my knights escort you out.”</p> \n     <p>Mrs. Kavint sprung to her feet\
  \ with a speed in stark contrast to her age but then immediately returned to the\
  \ same hobbled walk she used to enter the office. Toulon made sure to not let on\
  \ that he noticed the irregularity.</p> \n     <br clear=\"all\"> \n     <p>“Thank\
  \ you so much, Lictor. You won’t regret this. Cheliax will learn the truth and you’\
  ll be a hero. The people need to know.” She reached out for his hand. “Thank you,\
  \ thank you!”</p> \n     <p>“Yes, of course, Mrs. Kavint.” He pulled his hand back\
  \ from the woman’s tight, sweaty grip. “You have a good day.”</p> \n     <p>Toulon\
  \ returned to his desk and opened the report once again. <em>There’s definitely\
  \ something here</em>, he thought to himself, attempting to shake the woman’s sweat\
  \ from his hand. His flicks of the wrist did nothing, and as he reached for a handkerchief\
  \ he noticed it wasn’t sweat at all, but some kind of thick mucus, probably due\
  \ to her illness. <em>Disgusting.</em></p> \n     <br> \n     <center>\n      <hr\

  \ of Belde!” announced the guard.</p> \n     <p>An old man hobbled into the throne\
  \ room. Abrogail watched as he continued his pathetic entry and she soon grew tired\
  \ of waiting. “Paraduke Thurivan claims you have important information for me,”\
  \ she yelled out as he continued his approach. “Know that I bestow you a great honor\
  \ in just allowing you entrance in my palace. Now, what have you brought for me?”\

  \ Macijauskas</p> \n     <p>Lord Roverrint removed his hat and gave a slight bow\
  \ to Abrogail. “My queen, I wish to thank you for your generosity. My family and\
  \ the people of Belde believe you to be a just queen and—” </p> \n     <p>“Out with\
  \ it, Lord Roverrint,” spat Abrogail.</p> \n     <p>“Yes, my queen. I believe that\
  \ the Order of the Scourge is plotting against you. I believe that they mean to\
  \ depose you with claims that you’ve committed treason against Cheliax.”</p> \n\
  \     <p>“Lord Roverrint, if I had to accept audience for every rumor of action\
  \ against my throne, I would never leave this room,” Abrogail replied with contempt.\
  \ “What evidence do you have of these claims?”</p> \n     <p>“I have acquired a\
  \ copy of the material that they plan to use as evidence against you, my queen.”\
  \ The old man produced a folio from within his robes, brimming with papers and scrolls.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“Bring it here, Lord Roverrint.”</p> \n     <p>“Of course, my queen.”\
  \ Just as he began to step forward, he entered a coughing fit that echoed throughout\
  \ the throne room. Abrogial watched on in disgust for a moment before sending Gorthoklek\
  \ to fetch the folio. The pit fiend’s steps reverberated like massive boulders colliding\
  \ against the ground, each step wreathed in the crackle of flames. He plucked the\
  \ folio from Roverrint’s trembling hands and returned to his place beside the throne.\
  \ Gorthoklek leafed through the pages in an instant and then produced an audible\
  \ huff before closing the folio.</p> \n     <br clear=\"all\"> \n     <p>“Gorthoklek\
  \ tells me that some of this evidence is flimsy. In fact,” she smiled, “he believes\
  \ that attempting to use some of this will actively hurt their case and put them\
  \ in an incriminating position. Well done, Lord Roverrint.”</p> \n     <p>Recovering\
  \ from his fit, Roverrint replied in a strained voice. “Thank you, my queen. I wish\
  \ only what is best for you and Cheliax. Now, is there a possibility of a reward?”\
  </p> \n     <p>“Yes, of course.” Abrogail waved over a guard. “See to it that Lord\
  \ Reverrint receives a handsome reward for his loyalty to Cheliax and his queen.\
  \ That will be all.”</p> \n     <p>Abrogail stared off in the distance as the guards\
  \ escorted Roverrint out of the throne room. <em>Damned Touloc. He definitely has\
  \ something here</em>, she thought to herself as the throne-room doors closed.</p>\

  \ \n     <p>A wild cackling echoed through the abandoned home. “Yes, it is all done,\
  \ Chemurr.” Mrs. Kavint threw herself to the ground beside Lord Reverrint. “The\
  \ Great Master’s will is done.” </p> \n     <p>Chemurr gave a pleased smile. “Very\
  \ well. Kavint, Roverrint, you have earned a few minutes to speak with the master.”\
  \ Chemurr extended her hand and several thick, slimy phlegm worms crawled out from\
  \ her sleeve. The worms crawled forward, up toward Kavint’s and Roverrint’s ears.\
  \ The two let out a terrible wail, one part agony and one part pleasure, as they\
  \ collapsed in a writhing pile, calling out for the Great Master.</p> \n     <p>“\
  The knights and her queen shall begin to play, and soon will we see who has the\
  \ will to stay.” A phlegm worm writhed about between Chemurr’s fingers. “All while\
  \ the Great Master watches and laughs.”</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n\
