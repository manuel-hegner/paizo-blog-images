  >Jasilia tried to go back down the ladder, but it was too late. The giant skeleton\
  \ on the wall top—crowned with a royal blue khepresh, holding a jewel-encrusted\
  \ scepter of pure gold, and dressed like the pharaoh himself—reached out a massive\
  \ bony hand and grabbed her by the wrist.</span></p> \n    <p>She felt herself lurch\
  \ up into the air, her head spinning as she looked down at the army of skeletal\
  \ soldiers swarming up the ladder beneath Nekhtep. A moment later she and the Risen\
  \ Guard, who'd had no choice but to follow her up, were both standing before the\
  \ regally dressed skeleton.</p> \n    <p>\"This way, my honored guests.\" The towering\
  \ creature whirled, his shendyt kilt swishing, and strode off with royal bearing,\
  \ flanked by a dozen skeletal guards. Several other fetid warriors surrounded Jasilia\
  \ and Nekhtep, prodding the captives with ancient-looking spears that were nonetheless\
  \ still effective.</p> \n    <p>The wall walk led them to an enclosed ramp set in\
  \ the stone, which they descended for some time, making countless turns along torchlit\
  \ corridors until a weary dizziness overcame Jasilia. Finally, the steep passageway\
  \ ended and the captives found themselves passing through a doorway into an elaborately\
  \ furnished banquet hall. A great teakwood table stood at the spacious room's center,\
  \ set with golden dinnerware and fancifully decorated ceramic plates that Jasilia\
  \ recognized as dating from the late Apsu Dynasty. At the head of the table sat\
  \ a gold-painted, throne-like chair, to one side of which sat a man—a <i>living</i>\
  \ man—with his back turned to her. At hearing the entourage enter the hall, he turned,\
  \ a wide smile breaking on a face that bore a remarkable likeness to those of the\
  \ Ruby Prince and Jasilia herself.</p> \n    <p>\"Ojan!\" she cried.</p> \n    <p>The\
  \ regal-looking skeleton grinned with a flap of moldering lip still attached to\
  \ his lower jaw and motioned to the guards to stand down. At the signal, Jasilia\
  \ ran forward and threw her arms around her brother, tears of joy welling in her\
  \ eyes.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500_DuneRunner_Ojan.jpg\"\

  \    </div> \n    <p>\"Sit, O Heritors of Yafeha, and let us discuss business!\"\
  \ The rasping voice of Mekshir's skeletal lord carried an eerie cheeriness that\
  \ raised the hairs on the back of Jasilia's neck.</p> \n    <p>She slid onto the\
  \ wooden bench beside her brother and looked at him questioningly. \"Heritors of\
  \ Yafeha?\"</p> \n    <p>The joy in Ojan's eyes disappeared. \"Watch it,\" he whispered,\
  \ eyeing the regal skeleton as he settled into the throne at the head of the table.\
  \ \"He's as mad as Nethys.\"</p> \n    <p>\"What?\" she whispered back.</p> \n \
  \   <p>\"Just wait, you'll see.\"</p> \n    <p>Once Nekhtep had joined the others\
  \ at the table, the skeletal lord clacked his bony hands together and addressed\
  \ the ghastly soldiers who had gathered near a doorway on the far side of the hall.\
  \ \"Guards! Have the wait staff bring me and my guests the first course so that\
  \ we may begin our negotiations.\" One of the skeletons marched out of the room\
  \ while the others stood at attention.</p> \n    <p>The lord of Mekshir settled\
  \ his hollow orbits on Jasilia. \"Forgive me, my dear Hephre, for not introducing\
  \ myself earlier. But perhaps you've recognized me already? Does High Theurgist\
  \ Fentet-Pesu, the honorable royal governor of Thuvia, sound at all familiar to\
  \ you? After all, your father, Pharaoh Yafeha I, tried to have me assassinated—\
  by the hand of my own lover, no less!\" Fentet-Pesu banged the pommel of his scepter\
  \ against the tabletop, the finish of which Jasilia noticed was deeply pitted, as\
  \ if Mekshir's lord had made a habit of striking the end of his baton there. Jasilia\
  \ recalled from Anathepses's account how Xerbystes's soldiers had witnessed their\
  \ undead captor bang his scepter in just such a manner.</p> \n    <p>\"My name isn't—\
  \"</p> \n    <p>Ojan silenced her with a glare and a barely perceptible shake of\
  \ his head.</p> \n    <p>\"But of <i>course</i> my sister Hephre recognizes your\
  \ most honorable lordship,\" Ojan said. \"Don't you, sister?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Uh...\
  \ well, of course.\" And in fact, she did recognize the name, though only from some\
  \ musty scrolls she'd read in the royal library of Sothis. The last Osirian governor\
  \ of what was then the province of Thuvia had indeed been assassinated by his lover,\
  \ though if Yafeha I had been behind the act, that knowledge had been lost to history.\
  \ The idea of such a conspiracy made a kind of sense, however, as the murder of\
  \ Thuvia's governor had occurred in the final days of the Apsu Dynasty, just as\
  \ Osirian power had begun to wane and the ancient province of Thuvia was abandoned.\
  \ Perhaps Yafeha had wanted to tie up loose ends and eliminate a potential rival.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>She was about to question Mekshir's lord about Yafeha's motives when\
  \ suddenly the remnants of putrescent flesh on Fentet-Pesu's face took on what Jasilia\
  \ could only interpret as a puzzled expression. \"Hephre?\" the skeleton rasped,\
  \ tilting his skull as if he were trying to recall something. \"But didn't Yafeha's\
  \ daughter die from an asp's bite as a young child? You... you can't be her! You're\
  \ all trying to trick me into—!\" With no warning, Fentet-Pesu's entire frame began\
  \ to shudder, his bony arms clattering on the tabletop as the seizure took hold.\
  \ Then, as abruptly as it began, the shaking ceased.</p> \n    <p>\"Ah, beautiful\
  \ Hephre!\" said Mekshir's lord, his tone once again cheerful. \"Perhaps after you\
  \ poison your father for me, I shall make you my queen and together we'll bring\
  \ back Osirion's glory! Of course, I'm no fool. I'll have to hold your dear brother\
  \ Tenshep hostage to make sure you go through with the assassination.\"</p> \n \
  \   <p>\"Poison... my father?\" Jasilia said. \"You mean Yafeha?\"</p> \n    <p>Nekhtep\
  \ began to rise, looking like he meant to attack their mad host, but Jasilia kicked\
  \ him under the table. The Risen Guard sat back down.</p> \n    <p>Ojan cleared\
  \ his throat and addressed Fentet-Pesu. \"We accept!\" he proclaimed cheerfully.\
  \ \"My sister will poison our father, Yafeha I, and then you will marry Hephre and\
  \ ascend to Osirion's throne. Done and <i>done</i>!\" Ojan slapped down his hand\
  \ as if to seal the agreement.</p> \n    <p>The skeletal lord rose and banged the\
  \ pommel of his scepter against the deeply scored tabletop. \"You dare refuse me?\"\
  \ he cried. \"You <i>dare</i> say <i>no</i> to me?\"</p> \n    <p>Ojan spread his\
  \ hands in exasperation. \"Here's me saying yes! Yes, and <i>only</i> yes. We'll\
  \ <i>do</i> it! Won't we, sister?\" He shot Jasilia a desperate look.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>\"Absolutely!\" Jasilia exclaimed, turning back to Fentet-Pesu with an eager\
  \ smile. \"I'll poison my father and then we'll rule Osirion together. When do we\
  \ start?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Nobody refuses the will of Pharaoh Fentet-Pesu and lives!\"\
  \ Mekshir's lord shrieked. Again, he banged his scepter. \"Soldiers, lock them up\
  \ until I can think of the most painful way for them to die! Now take them from\
  \ my presence!\"</p> \n    <p>The skeletal soldiers shambled across the room and\
  \ roughly seized their lord's three guests. There was little to do but allow the\
  \ soldiers to drag them away. It was clear to Jasilia now that Fentet-Pesu was as\
  \ mad as a rabid jackal and there was no use in trying to reason with him.</p> \n\
  \    <p> After passing down a long hallway, Jasilia and her two companions were\
  \ pushed through a towering doorway. The soldiers swung the massive stone door on\
  \ its pivots, sealing their prisoners in a spacious chamber. From the jewels, gold\
  \ coins, and other riches heaped in great piles across the room, Jasilia knew it\
  \ could only be Mekshir's legendary treasure vault.</p> \n    <p>Ojan beat his first\
  \ against the cold limestone door, then turned his back to it and sank to the ground\
  \ in apparent defeat. \"What did I tell you, Jas? Thuvia's honorable governor is\
  \ hopelessly insane. He's going to kill us, no matter what we say or do.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>Jasilia began pacing the chamber, heedless of the riches at her feet, her\
  \ mind working furiously. There <i>had</i> to be a way out of their situation. She\
  \ couldn't just give up.</p> \n    <p>She told herself that for the next hour as\
  \ she strode back and forth across the room. Finally, with no solution having come\
  \ to her, she lay down on a pile of coins and closed her eyes, exhausted.</p> \n\
  \    <p align=\"center\"> ∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n    <p>When Jasilia stirred to wakefulness\
  \ an indefinable time later, she found Nekhtep kneeling beside her, his warm, calloused\
  \ hand holding her own. She rose to an elbow, questioning Nekhtep with her eyes.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"It wasn't supposed to end this way.\" The normally stony Risen Guard\
  \ countenance was gone from Nekhtep's face, replaced by one of deep sorrow.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"By Abadar's gavel, I don't care about the ending,\" she said, pulling\
  \ her hand from his. \"It's the middle I wanted. You know, the part with the <i>living</i>\
  \ in it. Why couldn't we have had <i>that</i>?\"</p> \n    <p>\"I had to protect\
  \ you.\"</p> \n    <p>\"<i>You what</i>?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Damn it, Jasilia, I didn't\
  \ die for the pharaoh! I died for <i>you</i>.\"</p> \n    <p>Jasilia sat up, her\
  \ heart pounding. \"Say again?\"</p> \n    <p>\"I couldn't tell you.\" Nekhtep looked\
  \ away. \"You're too stubborn. You'd have gotten yourself killed.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  <i>I'm</i> the stubborn one?\" Then the echo of man's words finally reached her.\
  \ \"Gotten myself killed?\" She rose to her feet, flushed with anger and confusion.\
  \ \"Spill it, Nekhtep. <i>Now</i>.\"</p> \n    <p>The Risen Guard stood and shrugged.\
  \ \"No reason to hold back anything now. The Ruby Prince explained to me in no uncertain\
  \ terms that if we continued our relationship, he wouldn't just murder me—he'd kill\
  \ you, too, to keep dishonor from the Forthbringers.\"</p> \n    <p>\"He'd murder\
  \ me,\" Jasilia said flatly.</p> \n    <p>Nekhtep nodded wearily. \"I had to die\
  \ under his knife, and in so doing bind myself to him and swear never again to speak\
  \ of the matter or to show my feelings for you. In exchange, he would let you live.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Oh, he'd let me live, would he?\" A sharp laugh escaped Jasilia.\
  \ \"You <i>idiot</i>. But then, you never had an older brother, did you?\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>Now it was Nekhtep's turn to be stunned. \"What?\"</p> \n    <p>Ojan, who\
  \ couldn't help but overhear their conversation, snickered from the other side of\
  \ the chamber. \"Our brother would never harm Jas. We've broken every rule he's\
  \ ever made for us—and trust me, we've broken some big ones—but has he touched us?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Jasilia looked down at Nekhtep, her arms folded. \"Don't you get it?\
  \ I was never in any danger. You let my overprotective big brother bully you, plain\
  \ and simple.\"</p> \n    <p>Nekhtep's eyes took on a faraway look, and then hardened\
  \ as he fell to his knees on the mound of treasure. His fist slammed into the pile,\
  \ coins and jewels flying.</p> \n    <p>Perhaps it was the sudden shock of Nekhtep's\
  \ revelation—that the man had only turned away from her out of a misguided sense\
  \ that he had to protect her—that jolted Jasilia's mind into a state of utter focus.\
  \ As if everything was unfolding in slow motion, she watched as Nekhtep's fist again\
  \ slammed down onto the pile of treasure, but this time, instead of gold coins and\
  \ rubies flying into the air, she saw only sand. She could almost hear the mill\
  \ of her mind grinding away at the problem.</p> \n    <p>\"That's it!\" she cried\
  \ suddenly.</p> \n    <p>\"I'm sorry.\" Nekhtep looked glumly up at her. \"How could\
  \ I have known...?\"</p> \n    <p>\"No, no, you big beautiful idiot!\" Jasilia knelt\
  \ down and kissed a surprised Nekhtep on the lips. \"We can work out our mess of\
  \ a relationship later.\" She rose and strode over to the great stone door. Sensing\
  \ her excitement, Nekhtep and Ojan both got up and followed her.</p> \n    <p>Jasilia\
  \ turned to Nekhtep. \"When you hit the pile of treasure and sprayed coins everywhere,\
  \ I had a thought: There has to be something triggering the khamsins that keep burying\
  \ and unburying Mekshir over the centuries. Then I remembered the story I'd told\
  \ you from Anathepses's <i>Desert Empires</i>. And how one of the party of Xerbystes's\
  \ soldiers must have escaped.\"</p> \n    <p>\"And?\" Nekhtep asked.</p> \n    <p>She\
  \ grinned back at him. \"And now we test my theory.\" She began slapping the stone\
  \ door with her palms and yelling at the top of her voice.</p> \n    <p>\"I'll do\
  \ it!\" she cried. \"I'll murder my father and help your lord become pharaoh!\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Ojan shook his head skeptically. \"We've already tried that.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"And you don't think he's crazy enough to change his mind?\" she said.\
  \ \"All I need is a moment in his presence. Just one moment.\"</p> \n    <p>Her\
  \ brother shrugged. \"I'm game,\" he said, and began yelling and beating his palms\
  \ against the door as well. Nekhtep joined in, until at last the door swung forward\
  \ on its pivots.</p> \n    <p align=\"center\"> ∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n    <p>Jasilia and her\
  \ companions were back in the banquet hall, standing before the mad governor of\
  \ ancient Thuvia, who sat on his throne at the table's head as if he had never left\
  \ it since ordering their deaths.</p> \n    <p>\"Welcome, dear Hephre and honorable\
  \ Tenshep,\" the skeleton lord said with great cheer. \"And...\" He waved a bony\
  \ hand dismissively at Nekhtep. \"...whoever you are.\" Then the dark cavities of\
  \ his eyes settled on Jasilia. \"I have a proposition to make, O daughter of Yafeha.\
  \ Before you dismiss it, hear me out. It involves poison, the death of your father,\
  \ and the ransom of your brother...\"</p> \n    <p>Before Fentet-Pesu could go on\
  \ with his all-too-familiar proposal, Jasilia jumped up onto the table and bolted\
  \ across it, skidding to a halt just before the enthroned skeleton. So unexpected\
  \ was her outburst that Fentet-Pesu merely gaped up at her, the fleshy piece of\
  \ rot that was once his lower lip swinging beneath his exposed jawbone like a morbid\
  \ pendulum.</p> \n    <p>While Mekshir's lord was thus frozen by surprise, Jasilia\
  \ reached down and plucked the scepter from his skeletal hands. She twirled the\
  \ ancient artifact over in her hand until she at last saw the triggering mechanism\
  \ jutting from the back of the baton's head.</p> \n    <p>\"Been nice chatting with\
  \ you, Fentet-Pesu,\" she said. \"Enjoy the next few hundred years of oblivion.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Jasilia smashed the scepter's head as hard as she could against Fentet-Pesu's\
  \ skull, directing the blow so that it would engage the artifact's trigger. The\
  \ crown flew from his head upon impact, and the skeletal lord screeched in rage.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Bitter cold ran up Jasilia's arm, until her hand felt as if it would\
  \ shatter like ice. Reflexively, she dropped the scepter, which fell back into Fentet-Pesu's\
  \ welcoming grasp. He thrust out his bony arms to grab her legs, but she was already\
  \ jumping down from the table.</p> \n    <p>A howling, dusty wind swept into the\
  \ chamber from both of its entrances, guttering the torches in the wall sconces.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Jasilia grabbed Nekhtep and her brother by the shoulders and shoved them\
  \ toward the door through which they had first entered the hall. \"Unless you want\
  \ to wake up as a skeleton in a century or two—<i>run</i>!\"</p> \n    <p>Her companions\
  \ didn't need further coaxing. Jasilia joined them in barreling through the confused\
  \ band of soldiers that stood before the doorway. Together, the three adventurers\
  \ ran up the winding passage, hot dust and sand blowing into their faces. When they\
  \ finally emerged onto the wall walk outside, they could barely see one another\
  \ through the sandstorm's fury.</p> \n    <p>By now the storm had already blown\
  \ away the gruesome ladders up which she and Nekhtep had climbed to enter the fortress.\
  \ But the gale had already heaped up mounds of sand against the parapet. Though\
  \ the drop to the ground was still precipitous, they might just survive the fall.\
  \ There was nothing for it but to jump, which the three did, hand in hand.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Jasilia landed hard, and for several moments she lay there, stunned and\
  \ unable to move. Then Nekhtep was pulling her to her feet and half-carrying her\
  \ from the fortress.</p> \n    <p>She couldn't see Ojan anywhere in the black, roiling\
  \ sands. Thankfully, the slow-witted undead of Mekshir hadn't thought to take her\
  \ satchel from her. She reached into it and felt for her goggles. Even once she\
  \ got them on, she was still practically blind.</p> \n    <p>Suddenly a hand reached\
  \ out of the maelstrom and grabbed her own. She barely made out Ojan's form, but\
  \ she knew he must be suffering worse than her, since he had no burnoose to protect\
  \ his face from the suffocating winds. Bowing into the storm's fury, they ran from\
  \ the fortress.</p> \n    <p>As they made their way into the desert, a familiar\
  \ bleating came out of the dunes. Jasilia whistled through her teeth over the storm's\
  \ deep roar, and Yamala trotted up to her side. The camel was spooked, but apparently\
  \ glad enough to see her mistress that she obeyed Jasilia's command to let her and\
  \ her two companions mount.</p> \n    <p>She felt a hand touch her arm, and instantly\
  \ she could breathe normally again. Ojan, seated behind her and Nekhtep, must have\
  \ cast a spell on each of them, including Yamala, who forged ahead with renewed\
  \ strength.</p> \n    <p>Jasilia looked back into the khamsin, knowing the sands\
  \ must be growing higher around the fortress with each minute that passed. She wondered\
  \ how many decades or centuries would pass before Fenete-Pesu stirred beneath the\
  \ heavy sands and reactivated his scepter, summoning a khamsin to unbury Mekshir\
  \ once again.</p> \n    <p>Leaning back into Nekhtep's embrace, she realized she\
  \ didn't care. It was time for her to break free of such pointless cycles in her\
  \ own life. It was the future that mattered.</p> \n    <p><i>The gloriously messy\
  \ and uncertain future</i>, she thought, and smiled.</p> \n    <p align=\"Center\"\
