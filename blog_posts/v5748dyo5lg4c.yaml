  \ itemprop=\"description\">When we decided to make this month's Pathfinder Campaign\
  \ Setting volume, <a href=\"/products/btpy95zo\"><i>Occult Mysteries</i></a>, the\
  \ development team had perhaps the most fun I can remember in almost 4 years at\
  \ Paizo coming up with the different setting-specific mysteries we wanted to explore\
  \ in the book.</span></p> \n    <p>One of the largest challenges was determining\
  \ what, in a world where magic, gods, divination, and the afterlife were demonstrably\
  \ real, constituted the \"occult.\" In our world, research into demons and devils\
  \ is certainly occult, but is it in a world where one of the most powerful nations\
  \ in the Inner Sea is openly and proudly in cahoots with the legions of Hell?</p>\
  \ \n    <p>In the end, we decided that \"occult\" in Golarion meant anything that\
  \ wasn't known to the general population. So while your average commoner pig farmer\
  \ doesn't know how to cast a spell, he's aware that magic exists. He's not, however,\
  \ likely to know that some magicians can augment their spellcasting by quickly analyzing\
  \ the mathematical constants that bind reality together, or that if the stars are\
  \ in the right alignment certain types of magic are more potent than normal.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>As much as we wanted to reveal a lot of the hidden truths behind some\
  \ of Golarion's longest standing mysteries (Why did the gnomes leave the First World?\
  \ Who created the multiverse? What's the deal with the Aucturn Enigma countdown\
  \ clocks in Osirion?) we also wanted to maintain the mystery that has inspired players,\
  \ GMs, and ourselves and our writers to use these mysteries as jumping-off points\
  \ in their own adventures. Thus, we made sure that every answer we provided left\
  \ another (sometimes several) in its place.</p> \n    <p>Subscribers have already\
  \ started getting their copies of Occult Mysteries, and the <a href=\"/products/btpy95zo/discuss?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Occult-Mysteries#tabs\"\
  >discussions</a> about what reveals they're most excited about and what questions\
  \ these revelations have raised are exactly what we'd hoped for. Make sure you pick\
  \ up a copy of Occult Mysteries and see what lies hidden just below the surface\
  \ of the Pathfinder campaign setting.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\
