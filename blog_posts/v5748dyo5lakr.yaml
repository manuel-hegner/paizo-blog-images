  \ \n    <p>Cave raptors are sated; it's time to blog!</p> \n    <p>There comes a\
  \ time in every game product's life when a developer has to learn to let go; to\
  \ let his sweet, innocent babe go out, make mistakes, and grow into a book. A game\
  \ product needs to stay out late, crash the car, and hang out with the wrong crowd.\
  \ And that wrong crowd is the art director, in Paizo's case the amazing Sarah Robinson\
  \ and the undefeated James Davis.</p> \n    <p>Welcome to the jungle we call layout.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>When last we saw <a href=\"/pathfinderCompanion/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy87dj\"\
  ><i>Dwarves of Golarion's</i></a>'s art director, she was a childhood friend helping\
  \ to tutor the infant sourcebook in good grooming and healthy posture. But now that\
  \ editorial puberty has hit, the art director becomes a corruptive influence. She'll\
  \ introduce the book to page composition, gateway fonts, and the pagan ways of design.\
  \ While the developer cares about making a good text, the art director (or humble-yet-beautiful\
  \ production goblin) is only concerned with tarting the book up.</p> \n    <p>Once\
  \ development and editing are finished, layout is everything else. It means making\
  \ an attractive page that doesn't remind the reader of a junior-high science textbook.\
  \ It means making sure the words, the art, and all the stat blocks don't trip over\
  \ each other. It also means constantly harassing the developers and editors to cut\
  \ or add words and send material to work with in a timely fashion. The process is\
  \ arduous, often checking a work line by line for tight spacing or dangling widows\
  \ (who hang around poorly laid-out products to get their kicks; during last month's\
  \ move we uncovered no fewer than thirty-eight widows cleverly concealing themselves\
  \ in the recycling bin). For any given product, the process may take hours, days,\
  \ or even weeks, depending on how recently the art director has been fed.</p> \n\
  \    <p>In ye olden times, layout was performed by hand, using glue and a layout\
  \ churn to mock up a page and send it away to the printer by horseless carriage.\
  \ These days, much of the hard work of layout is performed by computer, where all\
  \ the trimming and gluing are handled digitally. The common computer terms \"Cut,\"\
  \ \"Paste,\" and \"Churn\" actually hail from these pre-computer layout processes.</p>\

  \    </div> \n    <p>Like a fancy show octopus with a mastery of sign language,\
  \ a well laid-out product is a joy to look upon and easy to understand. While the\
  \ prose might make a book beloved, its layout makes it popular, and often the only\
  \ difference between a bestseller and a discount special is how well each page presents\
  \ itself. Without good layout, even well-written books would languish in exile,\
  \ their hideous countenances creating a wall between themselves and the general\
  \ populace. Resentment would set in, and as their numbers grew alongside their discontent,\
  \ murmurs of revolution would spread. Cries of \"Viva la Composicion!\" would echo\
  \ through the winding streets, followed by bloody, horrific riots. Heads of editors\
  \ and writers alike would roll as the dispossessed texts yearned for justice, but\
  \ settled for vengeance.</p> \n    <p>To dodge that bloodshed, make sure to follow\
  \ up your writing and editing with a loving layout. The bourgeoisie will thank you\
  \ for your effort.</p> \n    <p>And now our baby manuscript has grown up into a\
  \ finished book! Or has it? Still nothing more than a digital file and a pile of\
  \ black-and-white printouts, <a href=\"/pathfinderCompanion/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy87dj\"\
  ><i>Dwarves</i></a> won't be it's own book until it has returned with a diploma\
  \ from one of several prestigious printers. Next week, we'll examine what goes on\
  \ once the book is out of Paizo's hands.</p> \n    <p>Crystal Frasier <br>Production\
