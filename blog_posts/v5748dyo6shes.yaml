  \ from an article printed in the 1st Rova 4720 edition of <em>The Serene Mask</em>.</b><br>\
  \ Recently, I had the good fortune to sit down with newly established venture-captain\
  \ Narsen and ask a few questions about his newest endeavor in the city of Xer, fostering\
  \ relations between the Pathfinder Society and our beloved nation of Razmiran. His\
  \ answers, as always, show the glory of Razmir’s blessings on his followers. I encourage\
  \ my readers to journey to Xer and visit the Lodge for yourself. -Talmat Urndrin</p>\
  \ \n      <p><b>What’s your full name and title?</b><br> <em>Narsen, no surname,\
  \ Mask of the Twelfth Step, Venture-Captain of the Exalted Lodge, Priest of the\
  \ Living God. For the sake of simplicity and posterity, you may call me simply Venture-Captain\
  \ Narsen.</em></p> \n      <p><b>How did you become an adventurer?</b><br> <em>Adventurer?\
  \ Me? Oh, I daresay not. I’m simply a scholar and holy man whose service to his\
  \ god and country requires consorting with a wide array of those who seek knowledge.</em></p>\
  \ \n      <p><b>How did you become a Venture-Captain in the Society?</b><br> <em>I\
  \ pursued the opportunity myself, petitioning both my superiors within the church\
  \ and the Pathfinder Society leadership at the Grand Lodge. Fortunately for me,\
  \ both parties discovered that they had mutual interests and those interests were\
  \ best served by allowing me to act as the liaison between the Pathfinder Society\
  \ and Razmiran.</em></p> \n      <br clear=\"all\"> \n      <p><b>Which School did\
  \ you train with?</b><br> <em>I’m afraid I did not have the opportunity to train\
  \ at one of the Society’s Schools. I was field commissioned as a reward for my efforts\
  \ to foster the alliance that allowed my lodge to be created. I have exchanged several\
  \ letters with the Master of Scrolls, Kreighton Shaine, however. A remarkable man\
  \ with a fascinating mind; I fancy we might be something resembling friends, though\
  \ we’ve yet to meet in person.</em></p> \n      <p><b>Did you support any Factions\
  \ during your adventuring career?</b><br> <em>Though I received my commission in\
  \ the field, I must admit that I’m quite fond of the Grand Archive’s goals and mission.\
  \ The pursuit and preservation of knowledge has been my own lifelong goal; knowledge,\
  \ after all, is the power to shape the world in its most basic form.</em></p> \n\
  \      <p><b>How do you find that your experience as a priest of Razmir helps you\
  \ with your job?</b><br> <em>Hmmm… I think that perhaps the best way to answer your\
  \ question is to say that Razmir helps those who help themselves. I receive Razmir’\
  s blessings because I am good at my job, not the other way around.</em></p> \n \
  \     <p><b>Who is the most formidable opponent you’ve dealt with?</b><br> <em>Oh,\
  \ Ambrus Valsin, without a doubt. My esteemed superior in the Pathfinder Society\
  \ received my initial request to open a lodge here with a great deal of skepticism,\
  \ and I could show you cabinets full of our many correspondences. He is a remarkable\
  \ intellect and unlike most men who possess such keen minds, he is keenly aware\
  \ of his own limitations. I daresay I respect him more than any rival, monster,\
  \ or heretic I have ever had to face.</em></p> \n      <p><b>What is some advice\
  \ you have for the newest Pathfinder recruits?</b><br> <em>Approach the world with\
  \ an open mind. Every face, every locale, every turn of phrase is a treasure chest\
  \ containing secrets shaped by generations. Accepting how little you know is the\
  \ first step in discovering how much the world has to offer.</em></p> \n      <p><b>Who\
  \ do you see as the Pathfinder Society’s ultimate foe?</b><br> <em>Time itself,\
  \ of course. Each day that passes, the last bearer of a secret that was once widely\
  \ known passes from the world. A temple built to withstand a millennium sees that\
  \ time end and crumbles to dust. As an organization that seeks to record the secrets\
  \ of the world, there is no enemy more capable of thwarting the Society’s goals\
  \ than time.</em></p> \n      <p><b>What do you never leave home without?</b><br>\
  \ <em>My mask and my wayfinder. I have two allegiances, the first to Razmir and\
  \ the second to the Pathfinder Society, and I am quite proud of both. I would never\
  \ deign to be seen without either.</em></p> \n      <p><b>Can you give us a funny\
  \ story about being a Pathfinder?</b><br> <em>I once met a fierce woman who had\
  \ dedicated her life to Sarenrae. Each time she comes to the Exalted Lodge, she\
  \ attempts to convince me that I am in need of her goddess’s redemption, and I try\
  \ to convince her that her zeal and intellect would carry her far in the priesthood\
  \ of Razmir. One day, she attempted to prove her goddess’s superiority by challenging\
  \ me to a spell duel. She had apparently come to the obviously false conclusion\
  \ that Razmir would not grant me magic to rival that given her by her goddess. I\
  \ acquiesced to her request and gathered witnesses for a formal duel. When the duel\
  \ began, she attempted to cast her first spell. I commanded her to sneeze in the\
  \ name of Razmir and she did so, losing her spell. We went through this perhaps\
  \ half a dozen times before she conceded. I fear she was quite unhappy about how\
  \ the duel played out, though I must say I found the situation humorous. Power lies\
  \ not in complexity, but in simplicity, and we should never assume that our beliefs\
  \ constitute facts. Only the truth is the truth; all else is deceit and conjecture.</em></p>\
  \ \n      <p><b>What is your favorite Golarion delicacy?</b><br> <em>A few months\
  \ ago, I traveled to Absalom to meet with Ambrus Valsin about some logistical matters.\
  \ While there, I was introduced to a Vudran baker named Arvya who made the most\
  \ delicious muffins I have ever tasted. I believe she used saffron and turmeric\
  \ along with some kinds of seeds and berries, and the taste bordered on the divine.\
  \ I offered her a job here at the Exalted Lodge but I’m afraid she declined. Apparently,\
  \ she had already made a quite lucrative arrangement with Ambrus to supply the Grand\
  \ Lodge with her delicacies while maintaining her business and interests in the\
  \ city. She also declined to sell me her recipe, though I have Chef Mayar here at\
  \ the lodge working diligently to unravel it, with full access to all the spices\
  \ and ingredients I could obtain from the markets in the City at the Center of the\
  \ World.</em></p> \n      <p><b>If you’re trying to impress someone visiting town,\
  \ where do you take them?</b><br> <em>Why, where else but the Exalted Lodge? A castle\
  \ built on the bones of history and darker things, forged from the allied fires\
  \ of Razmiri will and Pathfinder ingenuity. Save for Thronestep itself, there is\
  \ no place in all of Razmiran as impressive as this hallowed edifice.</em></p> \n\
  \      <p><b>What part of your lodge do you most enjoy spending time in?</b><br>\
  \ <em>Our library. As you have no doubt gathered from our conversation, I value\
  \ almost nothing so much as knowledge, and I daresay there is nowhere within a thousand\
  \ miles where one can find as much knowledge as in the tomes and scrolls stored\
  \ therein. Treatises on Razmir’s ascension to godhood, stories gathered from the\
  \ far corners of the world by Pathfinders of all creeds and persuasion, scrolls\
  \ retrieved from temples that stood in this region long before the fall of Aroden…\
  \ I am proud of this collection and avail myself of it whenever I can. I’ve not\
  \ yet read every piece of writing we have gathered but I certainly intend to do\
  \ so.</em></p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/8fec392e-ff95-420f-a457-4eb5bd01732a/100820_EXALTED-LODGE.png\"\

  \ finishes reading, folds the broadsheet, then hesitates before adding it to the\
  \ stack of read papers. He grabs a quill and parchment with which he writes a quick\
  \ note, then rings the bell on his desk. A gray-robed initiate answers his summons\
  \ immediately.</p> \n      <p>“Take this note to the scribes and ask them to send\
  \ a copy to the quartermaster of every lodge surrounding Lake Encarthan and in the\
  \ River Kingdoms posthaste. Have the scribes emphasize that finding a copy of the\
  \ Rova edition of <em>The Serene Mask</em> takes precedence over other tasks. Dismissed!”\
  </p> \n      <p>The Initiate grabs the note and rushes out the door.</p> \n    \
  \  <p>“Oh Narsen,” Ambrus mutters. “What words of yours are they omitting?”</p>\
