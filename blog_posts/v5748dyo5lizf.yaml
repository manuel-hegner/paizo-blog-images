  \ This year we're bringing a big pile of exciting titles, including <a href=\"/products/btpy9n5a\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Horror Adventures</em></a>, <a href=\"/products/btpy9nfl\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Player Companion: Legacy of Dragons</em></a>, and of course the\
  \ much-anticipated <a href=\"/products/btpy9l30\"><em>Pathfinder Society Pawn Collection</em></a>.\
  \ You'll see even more at the end of August, with <a href=\"/products/btpy9nft\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Player Companion: Haunted Heroes Handbook</em></a>, as well as <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy9ng0\"><em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Planes of Power</em></a>,\
  \ which serves as a key sourcebook for the upcoming <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5liu5\"\

  \ why stop there? Gen Con's traditionally the <a href=\"/pathfindersociety\">Pathfinder\
  \ Society Roleplaying Guild's</a> opportunity to release a few extra adventures.\
  \ This year, thanks to the July release date being so close to the convention itself,\
  \ it's almost as though they were one and the same—at least that's how it's felt\
  \ around here! As a result, we have 11 exciting adventures we're featuring at the\
  \ convention. Let's take a look!</p> \n    <p>Nearly six years ago, the Pathfinder\
  \ Society traveled to a promising archaeological site known as <a href=\"/products/btpy8g1o\"\
  >Azlant Ridge</a> outside Bloodcove at the edge of the Mwangi Expanse. Ever since\
  \ then, I've heard players ask what became of that site and if the Society had uncovered\
  \ more of its mysteries. At long last, we've returned, guided by contributor and\
  \ veteran Pathfinder Society author Ron Lundeen, taking your Tier 3-7 characters\
  \ deeper into the Terwa Uplands in <a href=\"/products/btpy9m04\"><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Society Scenario #7-27: Beyond Azlant Ridge</em></a>! This was also our opportunity\
  \ to depict the unflappable Juliet Dias, the expedition's manager shown below.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Something's rotten in the state of Thuvia, and although the Pathfinder\
  \ Society has <a href=\"/products/btpy9k9\">uncovered a vile plot</a> and <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9k93\">helped thwart it</a>, the mastermind is still on the loose.\
  \ Thankfully, a key member of the plot has reconsidered her loyalties and has reached\
  \ out to the Society for help, as she has learned that the villains intend to cast\
  \ the Thuvian city-states into civil war in a bid for personal power. Political\
  \ intervention isn't the Society's standard practice, but if a band of elite agents\
  \ can thwart this conspiracy, avert disaster, and also eliminate the ringleader\
  \ of the Korholm Agenda, it's worth entering hostile territory. Luis Loza brings\
  \ Season 8 to a climatic, Tier 7-11 close in <a href=\"/products/btpy9m03\"><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Society Scenario #7-28: Ageless Ambitions</em></a> in Aspenthar, domain of the\
  \ ambitious Prince Zinlo (pictured below)!</p> \n    <p>In April we began a grand\
  \ undertaking with <a href=\"/products/btpy9k93\"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario\
  \ #7-20: All for Immortality, Part 1: First Taste of Eternity</em></a>: the reintroduction\
  \ of dedicated, high-level content in the Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild.\
  \ So far the feedback we've received has been really encouraging—certainly making\
  \ us consider more Tier 12-15 content in the future—and working on the series (including\
  \ some ludicrous hard mode options) has been a lot of fun. Of course, high-level\
  \ content benefits from high-level settings, and what better place is there for\
  \ a Pathfinder to go than the heart of the Aspis Consortium. I've left the fate\
  \ of the Consortium is in your hands in <a href=\"/products/btpy9m02\"><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Society Scenario #7-29: All for Immortality, Part 3: Serpents Fall</em></a>!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>And because I'm a glutton for punishment, I took on a second adventure\
  \ during this busy time: an exciting sequel to last season's <a href=\"/products/btpy9cu0\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Special #6-98: Serpents Rise</em></a> that sends a motley\
  \ band of 8th-level Aspis agents and misfit hirelings deep into Nidal to infiltrate\
  \ a threat to the Consortium's authority. We debuted <a href=\"/products/btpy9lzy\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Special #7-98: Serpents' Ire</em></a> at PaizoCon 2016,\
  \ and it's undergone some polishing since then to trim its run-time, making it a\
  \ great fit for Gen Con this year.</p> \n    <p>The pregenerated character adventure\
  \ model has proven an exciting way to tell stories happening outside the Grand Lodge—\
  especially when showing what's in store for the campaign's next season. Developer\
  \ Linda Zayas-Palmer has also worked behind the scenes on many of our best scenarios\
  \ and the Campaign Clarifications document, and this time the stars aligned for\
  \ her to apply her narrative mastery and author the spectacular <a href=\"/products/btpy9mbd\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Special #7-99: Through Maelstrom Rift</em></a>. An organization\
  \ known as the Concordance of Elements has sensed a dangerous anomaly on the Plane\
  \ of Air, and the ruling council (including one of its representatives pictured\
  \ below) has dispatched an eclectic team representing the united elemental forces\
  \ to avert the looming disaster and discover its cause. If the idea of playing a\
  \ proud genie, a miniature dragon, or an elemental serpent made of living lava strikes\
  \ your fancy, don't miss this great adventure for 6th-level pregenerated characters.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Phew! Time to catch my breath for a moment.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\"\

  \   </div> \n    <p>In Season 4 of the campaign, the Society spent a lot of time\
  \ in Varisia. We've taken an extended break in the years since, but with the imminent\
  \ release of the updated <a href=\"/products/btpy9nme\"><em>Pathfinder Adventure\
  \ Path: Curse of the Crimson Throne</em></a>, the prospect of visiting Korvosa again\
  \ was just too good to pass up. You may recall that the Society has a good friend,\
  \ Zeeva Foxglove, who runs the nearby <a href=\"/products/btpy8u8s\"><em>Green Market</em></a>,\
  \ and she's contacted Venture-Captain Sheila Heidmarch with a desperate plea for\
  \ assistance. Scott Sharplin spins us an engaging urban adventure with mysteries,\
  \ plots, and just a hint of pseudodragons in the Tier 1-5 <a href=\"/products/btpy9mba\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-01: Portent's Peril</em></a>.</p> \n    <p>One\
  \ of the greatest strengths of Pathfinder Society scenarios as a medium is that\
  \ they allow us to explore such a wide variety of places in the course of a year.\
  \ I'm always looking for more ways to feature Tian Xia, and we planted a pretty\
  \ significant plot hook <a href=\"/products/btpy9cty\">near the end of Season 6</a>\
  \ in the hope of traveling to the sorcerer kingdom of Dtang Ma. An unlikely ally\
  \ (the friendly disembodied head pictured below) has pointed the Society to an abandoned\
  \ temple that still contains historical records dating back a millennium or more.\
  \ The PCs tread on sacred ground, though, and they must watch their step if they\
  \ are to scale a mountain, study this lost site, and save a lost soul. Contributor\
  \ Mikko Kallio shows off his story-telling talents in <a href=\"/products/btpy9mbb\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-02: Ward Asunder</em></a>, a Tier 3-7 adventure.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Two years ago, hundreds of Pathfinders <a href=\"/products/btpy97n3\"\
  >gathered in the halls of the sky citadel Jormurdun</a> to reclaim it for study.\
  \ The Society turned control of it over to the dwarves of the Five Kings Mountains\
  \ shortly thereafter, and they have industriously worked to restore their ancestral\
  \ home. The duergar of the nearby Darklands are none to thrilled about this development,\
  \ and in a recent attack, they captured a host of dwarves, put them in chains, and\
  \ began driving them south toward a future of slavery or sacrifice. Jormurdun has\
  \ asked the Society to intercept the duergar before they escape, but taking on such\
  \ a large force won't be easy. Mike Kimmel takes the PCs deep underground to gather\
  \ allies and launch a daring rescue in <a href=\"/products/btpy9mbc\"><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Society Scenario #8-03: Captives of Toil</em></a>, which has special opportunities\
  \ for members of the Liberty's Edge faction.</p> \n    <p>Wait, you want more? Sure,\
  \ I've got three more gems for you.</p> \n    <p>We're debuting a new set of six\
  \ 1st-level quests by Eleanor Ferron, and Jenny Jarzabski, and Landon Winkler. In\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9mb9\"><em>Honor's Echo</em></a>, the PCs assist a disenfranchised\
  \ Taldan nobleman, the descendant of the heroic Honaria Alcasti whom the empire\
  \ used as a scapegoat centuries ago. In order to restore the family's name, he and\
  \ the PCs search Taldor, Andoran, and Qadira for evidence of Honaria's good deeds\
  \ and make a case before one of Taldor's most influential figures. Like past quest\
  \ series, Honor's Echo is for 1st-level pregenerated characters, but we are decoupling\
  \ past quest series (i.e. <a href=\"/products/btpy98nh\"><em>The Silverhex Chronicles</em></a>\
  \ and <a href=\"/products/btpy9fi8\"><em>Phantom Phenomena</em></a>) from the pregenerated\
  \ character requirement.</p> \n    <p>Gen Con is also the debut of Pathfinder Academy,\
  \ an extension of previous years' Kids Track program. This year we're adding a five-quest\
  \ series dubbed Transitions that teach players key lessons—attacks of opportunity,\
  \ splash weapons, combat maneuvers, conditions, and more—as they graduate from the\
  \ <em>Beginner Box</em> to the full Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. After each short\
  \ lesson is an adventure that highlights those rules and follows the story of the\
  \ heroes tracking down villainous Aspis agents who have stolen holy relics from\
  \ Magnimar. By the end, the players are ready to participate in some Pathfinder\
  \ Society adventures. In fact, we've dedicated several tables to kid-friendly games—\
  some even run by young GMs! Seth Brummond, Andrew Hoskins, Bob Jonquet, Nathan King,\
  \ Lucas Servideo, and Michael VonHasseln contributed a combination of adventures,\
  \ lessons, and wisdom to make this project a reality.</p> \n    <p>Finally, there's\
  \ the big interactive event: <a href=\"/products/btpy9mbe\"><em>Pathfinder Society\
  \ Special #8-00: The Cosmic Captive</em></a> by Matt Duval! The asteroid known as\
  \ Aucturn's Tear flies through the solar system every 56 years, but strangely it\
  \ has begun glowing brightly in the night sky while opening portals to another realm\
  \ as it passes by planets. Hmmm... the more I talk about the story, though, the\
  \ more I spoil the adventure. Let's boil it down to a few key points. First, we're\
  \ exploring new design territory for interactive adventures, combining both traditional\
  \ aspects of the interactive experience with a host of new ways to affect other\
  \ tables. Second, it's loaded with elemental goodness—and not just the “I'm immune\
  \ to critical hits” elementals, but also fun elemental themes and locations. Third,\
  \ it's the first interactive adventure to combine the Roleplaying Guild and Adventure\
  \ Card Guild into one giant event. Finally, it's a stellar debut to an incredible\
  \ new season: The Season of the Stolen Storm!</p> \n    <p>We'll see you at <a href=\"\
