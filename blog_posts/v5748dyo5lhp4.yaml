  description\">Almost three weeks ago, the vigilantes of the world struck out from\
  \ the shadows and began to carve their own niches in <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/ultimateIntrigue\"\
  >a new open playtest</a>. After plenty of feedback and several playtests of the\
  \ vigilante, the vigilante returned to his lair to recover from his wounds and prepare\
  \ his toolbox for his next greatest challenge... and so, the vigilante returns,\
  \ with more tricks than ever before!</p> \n    <p>For those of you familiar with\
  \ the first playtest vigilante, there's some huge changes in the new versions. In\
  \ my opinion, the biggest of all was the change to the social identity. The first\
  \ round vigilante received set abilities in his social identities, but many playtesters\
  \ pointed out that every vigilante has a slightly-different take on their social\
  \ identity, so maybe they won't all have abilities befitting of Bruce Wayne. The\
  \ new version of the vigilante allows each vigilante to choose from a list of social\
  \ talents at odd levels, to complement his vigilante talents at even levels. This\
  \ allows you to prioritize the social abilities that are perfect for your own vigilante's\
  \ social identity. For instance, you can gain the ability to switch identities quickly\
  \ at a lower level... speaking of which, however, leads me to the second and perhaps\
  \ more important part of the change in how identities work. In the new version of\
  \ the vigilante, it only takes 1 minute to change identities even at 1st level (down\
  \ from 5 minutes). But beyond that, as many of you suggested in the discussion threads,\
  \ vigilantes can now use all their vigilante abilities in their social identity;\
  \ they just risk being exposed if they do!</p> \n    <p>The other huge change is\
  \ to the zealot specialization. In the first round, playtesters pointed out that\
  \ the zealot didn't have enough of its own identity as a specialization like the\
  \ others did, and too many of the abilities were similar to those of previous classes.\
  \ Following some very clever suggestions from the playtest forums, the revamped\
  \ zealot, inspired by superheroes with divine origins, chooses one of four potential\
  \ sources for his power and gains a special ability, new talent options, and some\
  \ changes to his spells known based on his choice. Whether you play an abyssal zealot\
  \ with claws (and the ability to gain rend!) or a fey zealot with the ability to\
  \ turn invisible while moving, the choice is yours!</p> \n    <p>There are a number\
  \ of other smaller changes within the talents and specializations as well. Together\
  \ they add up. For instance, many playtests of the stalker indicated that its unique\
  \ talents allowed it to play differently than the playtester first expected, and\
  \ now, with a few new talents, the specific ability to do full hidden strike damage\
  \ on every attack against a foe affected by startling appearance, and upgraded damage\
  \ on a full hidden strike (d8s instead of d6s), the stalker continues its path of\
  \ darkness. Meanwhile, the avenger has gained some upgrades and consolidation of\
  \ key talents that grant him some powerful abilities. For instance, now if you take\
  \ hard to kill, you don't just gain Die Hard; you gain other powers like the ability\
  \ to wait a round before dying of hit point damage (during which you can heal it\
  \ off). The warlock's biggest change is to the powerful mystic bolts option, which\
  \ now allows you to use it in conjunction with way more other abilities and ignores\
  \ spell resistance, in return for a decrease in damage that is more-or-less cancelled\
  \ by the ability to use it with the arcane striker talent (which you previously\
  \ couldn't) alone!</p> \n    <p>So whatever style of vigilante you might be, whatever\
  \ secret hides within your fragmented heart, find the strength within yourself to\
  \ go forth and right the wrongs you crave to right... or, you know, commit those\
  \ wrongs; we don't discriminate against evil vigilantes!</p> \n    <h2>Roleplaying\
  \ Guild Vigilantes</h2> \n    <p>As we announced in the <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lhmq\"\
  >last playtest blog</a> this version of the vigilante is legal for play in the <a\
  \ href=\"/pathfindersociety\">Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild</a>. The Chronicle\
  \ sheet for the vigilante is now available for all participating in the playtest\
  \ in organized play! Go ahead and grab it now!</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p\

  \ design process than usual and makes them easy to find!</p> \n    <p>In honor of\
  \ the new round of the playtest, I think I'm going to make a dedicated stalker thread\
  \ to have some stalker chats with you guys. See you there!</p> \n    <p>Mark Seifter<br>\
