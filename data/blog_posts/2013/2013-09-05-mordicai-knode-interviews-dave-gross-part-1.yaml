  >In honor of the newly released Pathfinder Tales novel <a href=\"/products/btpy90py\"\
  ><em>King of Chaos</em></a>, we've pulled out all the stops and asked noted reviewer\
  \ Mordicai Knode to do a new interview with Dave Gross, the author behind Count\
  \ Jeggare and Radovan, two of the most beloved characters in the Pathfinder universe!</span></p>\n\
  \             <p>In 2010, Mordicai Knode was the first person to post a review of\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy8g3n\"><em>Prince of Wolves</em></a> after galleys went\
  \ out at the American Book Association in New York. Since then he has written a\
  \ <a href=\"http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/11/varian-jeggare-and-radovan-virholt-are-the-new-fafhrd-and-gray-mouserpathfinder-tales-queen-of-thorns\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">comprehensive review of the first three Radovan and the Count\
  \ novels</a> as well as <a href=\"http://www.tor.com/blogs/2013/08/book-review-king-of-chaos-dave-gross\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">the very first review of King of Chaos</a> at <b>tor.com</b>.</p>\n\
  \             <p>Despite Dave trotting across North America in order to sign books\
  \ and speak on panels at shows like Gen Con and Worldcon, Mordicai managed to track\
  \ him down via email. Here's what they had to say...</p>\n             <p><b>Let's\
  \ get this started with a chicken or the egg question: Who came first in your imagination,\
  \ Radovan or Varian?</b></p>\n             <p>Yes.</p>\n             <p>The story\
  \ sketch that became <a href=\"/products/btpy8k9l\">\"Hell's Pawns,\"</a> a serial\
  \ novella originally appearing in the Council of Thieves Adventure Path, was based\
  \ on a pitch I'd previously sent another editor a few years earlier. He took eight\
  \ months to respond and then quietly vanished from said publisher, so the story\
  \ sketch lingered in my ideas folder. Since that pitch centered on a noble figure\
  \ that later became Varian, you could argue that he came first.</p>\n          \
  \   <p>However, for Pathfinder I reworked the outline both to set it in Golarion\
  \ and to freshen it up. At that stage I'd decided to tell the story from two alternating\
  \ points of view, but when I began outlining I realized I had room enough for only\
  \ one. Taking the Holmes and Watson stories as a model, I decided it was more interesting\
  \ to tell the tale from the POV of the assistant rather than the detective.</p>\n\
  \             <p>And then, because I'd been watching a lot of film noir the previous\
  \ month and felt a tough-guy sensibility worked well in the capital city of Cheliax,\
  \ I adopted the attitude of a hard-boiled antihero for Radovan.</p>\n          \
  \   <p>Thus, the existence of a character <em>like</em> Varian came first (and in\
  \ fact, Varian might have been his name in the previous incarnation), but the tone\
  \ and personality of Radovan came together before I fleshed out the count.</p>\n\
  \             <p><b>Were there any interesting variations in the characters as you\
  \ shaped them? Was Radovan always part-devil, was Varian always a half-elf who threw\
  \ up when he tried to cast a spell? Did they go through versions and drafts where\
  \ they were profoundly different, or did they step fully formed onto the page, like\
  \ Howard and Conan?</b></p>\n             <p>Varian was always an armchair wizard,\
  \ although the exact nature of his disability evolved after \"Hell's Pawns\" when\
  \ I first started conceiving \n              <link for all instances><a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8g3n\"><em>Prince of Wolves</em></a>. Other details, like Varian's\
  \ and Radovan's mutual worship of Desna, or Lady Luck, were seeds I planted toward\
  \ a vague end that started taking shape when I outlined the first novel.</p>\n \
  \            <p>From the start, I wanted both Varian and Radovan to be of mixed\
  \ parentage. In pitch stage, Radovan was a half-orc with a vaguely East Asian name.\
  \ James Sutter told me there was another half-orc in the works for Pathfinder fiction\
  \ and suggested I make my character what we now call a hellspawn. Hell-wrought half-breeds\
  \ are more common in Cheliax, where devils have supplemented the human legions for\
  \ the past few generations. Of course, being perverse, I decided that, while Radovan\
  \ was hellspawn, he wasn't descended from a devil in Cheliax.</p>\n            \
  \ <p>When it came to the name, when James suggested a Tian (Pathfinder's equivalent\
  \ of Asian) name was a bit too unusual for Cheliax, I went to one of my other favorite\
  \ cultural analogs: the Ustalavs, similar to Eastern Europeans. Radovan was not\
  \ the first name I considered, but the moment I typed it, I knew it was right for\
  \ the character.</p>\n             <p>The secret of Radovan's ancestry was just\
  \ a vague idea when I was writing \"Hell's Pawns,\" but by the time I was outlining\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy8g3n\"><em>Prince of Wolves</em></a>, I had generated\
  \ a few pages of notes about the centuries preceding his birth. His secrets have\
  \ been coming out one big blossom at a time in these four novels. I keep a growing\
  \ secret timeline and notes for future revelations. With what's revealed in <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8u7i\"><em>Queen of Thorns</em></a> and <a href=\"/products/btpy90py\"\
  ><em>King of Chaos</em></a>, Varian is starting to catch up with Radovan in terms\
  \ of learning, \"What is wrong with me?!\"</p>\n             <p><b>There is sometimes\
  \ a sort of anachronistic sense of humor in your work, along with fairly contemporary\
  \ attitudes among your characters. To me it seems like you excel at being inspired\
  \ by things outside the usual fantasy tropes of elves and knights—things like grindhouse\
  \ wuxia movies or Universal horror films—and translating them plausibly into your\
  \ ostensibly fantasy stories. Do you see yourself writing in a very narrow subgenre\
  \ of your own creation? Who else do you think hits the same sweet spot? (I have\
  \ in mind Alex Bledsoe's Eddie LaCrosse series, personally.)</b></p>\n         \
  \    <p>\"Anachronistic\" always strikes me as a funny word to apply to an alternate\
  \ world. Sure, there are some striking similarities between many of Golarion's cultures\
  \ and those of the real world, but the stories aren't taking place in our past.</p>\n\
  \             <p>Still, I get what you mean. Some readers think fantasy occurs only\
  \ in Middle-Ages or Renaissance Britain. I like to choose dialect and tone to suit\
  \ a character or a region of the setting. For instance, Radovan, as a lower-class\
  \ Chelaxian, speaks with a kind of low-class, pulp-era attitude, while Varian wouldn't\
  \ seem out of place if he walked onto the set of Downton Abbey. I try to make the\
  \ elves look and sound different from the crusaders without making them all sound\
  \ like some near-variation of Tolkien's creations.</p>\n             <p>As for bringing\
  \ in non-standard-fantasy influences, I'm not anywhere close to the first writer\
  \ to do that. I think it's been in fantasy since the beginning, but the popularity\
  \ of the Tolkienesque model makes us forget they exist. The writer who first opened\
  \ my eyes to a different model for fantasy was Roger Zelazny, whose Corwin of Amber\
  \ was, I believe, partly inspired by the Travis McGee novels of John D. McDonald.</p>\n\
  \             <p>Also, I just like to write about the stuff I love, which in addition\
  \ to fantasy adventure includes things like classic horror films, wuxia movies,\
  \ and detective fiction. I like dogs, so there's a dog. I like jokes, so there are\
  \ jokes. And while I'm not a violent person, I enjoy action scenes, both the swashbuckling\
  \ ones and the gritty ones that make you sick of fighting.</p>\n             <p>Once\
  \ on a convention panel, one of my colleagues suggested that blending genres—like\
  \ humor and horror in the <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em> TV series—was a recent\
  \ trend. I noted <em>Abbot and Costello meet Frankenstein</em>, as well as Bob Hope\
  \ in <em>Ghost Breakers</em>, and that was enough to persuade him that we've been\
  \ crossing the streams for ages in film, but it's been with us in all art forever.\
  \ This idea of keeping a genre \"pure\" seems like a recent invention of booksellers\
  \ who want to keep the shelves organized, made worse by sales and marketing people\
  \ who want to focus on narrow categories to make their jobs easier and maximize\
  \ sales.</p>\n             <p>Part of the reason I love Asian movies, and many other\
  \ movies made outside of Hollywood, is that they so often don't obey the one-genre\
  \ rule. The closest I've come to a \"regular\" fantasy novel is probably <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8u7i\"><em>Queen of Thorns</em></a>, although <a href=\"/products/btpy90py\"\
  ><em>King of Chaos</em></a> is also not as noticeably stream-crossing as the first\
  \ two books.</p>\n             <p><b>You write about Varian and Radovan in a number\
  \ of different formats—serialized in printed adventures, ebook novellas, online\
  \ serials, and plain old-fashioned novels—and they are all fully integrated into\
  \ your stories. Kasiya, the mummified vampire antagonist of <em>King of Chaos</em>,\
  \ originally appeared in \"A Lesson in Taxonomy\" online, for instance. How do you\
  \ approach the different formats, and how do you see your writing evolving in response\
  \ to it?</b></p>\n             <p>Foremost in my mind is the importance of keeping\
  \ the stories independent of each other. It might be fun to read them chronologically\
  \ (except \"A Lesson in Taxonomy\"—don't read that one first), but the scheme is\
  \ that you can come into the setting and the characters from any one of those doors.\
  \ Frankly, I think some are more successful at that than others. To new readers\
  \ I tend to recommend <a href=\"/products/btpy8g3n\"><em>Prince of Wolves</em></a>,\
  \ since it's a solid foundation for both the characters and the setting. Still,\
  \ although you'd be coming in on the fourth \"season,\" you should be able to start\
  \ with any of the short fiction or novellas, and now especially <a href=\"/products/btpy90py\"\
  ><em>King of Chaos</em></a>, and not feel lost.</p>\n             <p>The short stories\
  \ are the most difficult and in some ways the most rewarding of the stories. I always\
  \ find myself stripping away subplots and details I wanted to include but couldn't\
  \ without muddling a short piece with too much incident.</p>\n             <p>I\
  \ much prefer the room allowed in a novella or novel, in part because I love subplots\
  \ and small character moments that don't at first seem relevant to the story, but\
  \ when you look back at them, you go, \"Oh!\"</p>\n             <p>After writing\
  \ a short story, I always feel energized to write a better single chapter in the\
  \ next novel. While the novels aren't a series of short stories, I admire the way\
  \ George R.R. Martin makes so many of the chapters in his Song of Ice and Fire such\
  \ strong, stand-alone stories, even when he leaves them on a cliffhanger. I am certainly\
  \ moving toward emulating that structure as I go forward.</p>\n             <p><b>Have\
  \ you decided what posterity should call the series? \"Radovan and the Count\"?\
  \ \"Varian and Radovan?\"</b></p>\n             <p>While I prefer \"Radovan and\
  \ the Count\" for I don't know why, I also use R&amp;J or R&amp;V for shorthand.\
  \ My editor, James Sutter, tends to use Varian and Radovan or vice versa. I don't\
  \ know that it's important, but I tend to leave off Radovan's surname because it's\
  \ a plot point in <a href=\"/products/btpy8g3n\"><em>Prince of Wolves</em></a>.</p>\n\
  \             <p><b>If you could send Radovan and the Count to any non-Pathfinder\
  \ setting, what would you pick? Extra points for increasing specificity!</b></p>\n\
  \             <p>Now there's a question I've never considered before. Let's immediately\
  \ disqualify any of the nascent settings I've been sketching out for original work.</p>\n\
  \             <p>The boys would fit in very well to Leiber's Nehwon or Zelazny's\
  \ Amber, I bet. And they wouldn't be entirely out of place in the Forgotten Realms.\
  \ Now I wonder whether they'd be a natural fit for the Iron Kingdoms.</p>\n    \
  \         <p>Because I've chosen areas in Golarion in part because of their resemblance\
  \ to real-world locations (Ustalav as Eastern Europe, Tian Xia as Asia, Cheliax\
  \ as imperial/infernal Rome), a very loose historical setting might work, although\
  \ for some reason that one seems weirder than the near-fits of other fantasy worlds.\
  \ Maybe it's because of the high level of magic the boys have encountered in Golarion.</p>\n\
  \             <p><b>So, Dave, what is the craziest thing you've ever done as \"\
  research\" for a book?</b></p>\n             <p>While it doesn't seem crazy to me,\
  \ my wife's eyes still bulge when I mention the 140 kung fu movies I watched or\
  \ re-watched before, during, and long after writing <a href=\"/products/btpy8mfm\"\
  ><em>Master of Devils</em></a>. Fortunately, a surprising number of them are good,\
  \ and an even larger number were cheap.</p>\n             <p>From another angle,\
  \ the craziest thing I've done is learning a 10-year-old setting over a period of\
  \ just a few months. Granted, I had a lot of help and handholding, but that's the\
  \ one that felt like walking a high wire over a pit of fast-zombie tigers.</p>\n\
  \             <p><b>Do you consider Radovan and the Count to be \"gaining levels\"\
  \ as the books progress? It's a very high-level world, but as they go along in their\
  \ stories—learning more about their abilities, and picking up new tricks—it seems\
  \ that they are getting more capable, and more organic. Does that meta-fiction constraint,\
  \ of experience and levels, factor in to your mental calculus for the characters?</b></p>\n\
  \             <p>The short answer to your question is \"yes.\"</p>\n           \
  \  <p>But remember that they're both gaining and losing levels, learning new abilities\
  \ and losing some because of \"reasons.\" You're right to call that an instance\
  \ of meta-fiction, but it's not always a constraint. Sometimes the Paizo developers\
  \ and editors let me explore new directions with the rules, as long as there's a\
  \ story reason for it that still connects to the magic \"physics\" by story logic.</p>\n\
  \             <p>For instance, the whole business of Radovan's journey in <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8mfm\"><em>Master of Devils</em></a> brings him to a truly frightening\
  \ level of physical threat, but all he wants is to be free of the thing that gives\
  \ him that power. The outcome of that journey haunts him in <a href=\"/products/btpy8u7i\"\
  ><em>Queen of Thorns</em></a> and makes him look back on his brutal upbringing.\
  \ Sometimes the thing he hates the most is what he's been taught to be, what he's\
  \ \"built for.\"</p>\n             <p>Likewise with Count Jeggare's magical \"disability.\"\
  \ In game terms, there's no reason he shouldn't be able to cast spells, but I proposed\
  \ a reason for his problem to James Sutter very early on. In <a href=\"/products/btpy90py\"\
  ><em>King of Chaos</em></a>, I finally get to reveal why he's been handicapped all\
  \ these decades. But if you know the character, you can already imagine some of\
  \ the psychological obstacles he'll to continue to face even though he seems at\
  \ last to understand the true nature of his magical ability.</p>\n             <p>If\
  \ I can use the game mechanics to reflect a character's internal conflict, that's\
  \ what I try to do.</p>\n             <p><b>Conan winds up on the throne. We all\
  \ know that; we know that even when we read Conan stories from when he was a pirate\
  \ or a thief or a mercenary. Do you know the eventual fate of the Count and Radovan?</b></p>\n\
  \             <p>No.</p>\n             <p>That said, I have a ridiculous number\
  \ of story ideas cluttering my head, some of them focusing on the boys, but others\
  \ featuring some of the secondary characters from their novels. There are experiences\
  \ I want each of them to have, tests I'd like to see them face, losses they need\
  \ to suffer... and, to be perfectly honest, also some Golarion-shaking events I'd\
  \ like them to be a part of if and when the time comes that the shepherds of the\
  \ world are ready to release that particular catastrophe and will invite me to put\
  \ the boys into play.</p>\n             <p>I've shared a short wish list of these\
  \ events with James Sutter, James Jacobs, and Wes Schneider. One day maybe I'll\
  \ get an email that begins, \"You know how you said you'd like to write something\
  \ involving the return of <b>REDACTED</b> or a war between <b>REDACTED</b> and <b>REDACTED</b>?\
  \ That time is nigh!\"</p>\n             <p><em>Dave Gross recently launched a new\
