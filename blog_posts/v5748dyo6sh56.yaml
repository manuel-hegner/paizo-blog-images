  \     </div> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Zemir stepped\
  \ around a fetid pool of… something… and tried to breathe shallowly. Intellectually\
  \ he knew that either his mask was working or it wasn’t, and either way the worst\
  \ he’d suffer was a strong sense of nausea if he did get a whiff of unfiltered air.\
  \ But the horrid smell that penetrated the mask’s filters still made him want to\
  \ avoid taking deep lungfuls of the stuff. Which made it difficult to keep up with\
  \ Obozaya, as his vesk companion strode unfettered through the densely-packed market.</p>\

  \      </div> \n      <p>“I still do not understand you mammals!” Obozaya sounded\
  \ more amused than perplexed. “If the atmosphere’s odor is so terrible it turns\
  \ you into mewling monkeys, why not activate your environmental controls rather\
  \ than just using the breather mask?”</p> \n      <p>Zemir ignored the “monkeys”\
  \ jab. He was still relatively new to the crew of the Sunrise Maiden, hired for\
  \ his power to search through and bring things from various iterations of reality.\
  \ Obozaya was a respected, veteran member of the crew, and Zemir was better off\
  \ humoring her. If he could earn Obozaya’s trust, the rest of the crew would quickly\
  \ follow.</p> \n      <p>“There are two reasons.” Zemir sidestepped a group of haggling\
  \ kasathas and picked up his pace to walk next to the vesk. “The first is that I’\
  m not sure how much I trust this filter to pull the actual toxins out of the air,\
  \ given how much of the rotting-fish-and-eggs odor it lets in. Since we’re here\
  \ to get surplus air filters and pressurized tents so the rest of our crew can operate\
  \ on this planet long-term—longer than our armor’s environmental seals will last—\
  I’d like to test this model in the field. I don’t fully trust AbadarCorp’s marketing\
  \ claims.”</p> \n      <p>Obozaya nodded, her teeth flashing briefly in what Zemir\
  \ had come to believe was an expression of appreciation. Vesk might be one of a\
  \ dozen species immune to the toxins in this planet’s air, but she was pragmatic\
  \ enough that she certainly wouldn’t want her teammates hampered by nausea and weakness\
  \ if their mission ran more than a few days.</p> \n      <p>“Secondly... are we\
  \ being followed?”</p> \n      <p>Zemir did not change the tone of his voice at\
  \ all, and to her credit Obozaya did not spin to look around. Instead she simply\
  \ angled her path to skirt a denser part of the crowded market’s patrons. Zemir\
  \ fell in behind her, moving through the wake she made in the throng. Creatures\
  \ of half a dozen species cursed and stepped in behind them, shaking fists and raising\
  \ their chins in angry postures. Which meant it was easy for Zemir to spot the group\
  \ following them as they plowed into the already-agitated crowd, shoving sapients\
  \ out of their way while remaining quiet and taking on hunched postures, trying\
  \ to keep their profiles below the general level of the market’s customers.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>There were three of them, short and broad humanoids in heavy armor.\
  \ Zemir guessed they were lashuntas... or dwarves, though he had much less experience\
  \ with dwarves. Their equipment was worn and patched, but looked functional enough.\
  \ All three had laser rifles of some kind slung over their shoulders, and holstered\
  \ sidearms. Their armors’ environmental seals were active, protecting them from\
  \ the extreme discomfort of the atmosphere, and making their faces harder to discern.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>But their facial tattoos were clear enough. He shifted his view, searching\
  \ through nearby iterations of his own reality, and saw the three figures following\
  \ someone on this street, at this time, in most alternate realities. Their presence\
  \ here was not random.</p> \n      <p>Obozaya took a sharp turn onto another major\
  \ road and stepped to the side, allowing Zemir to pass her. She shot him a glance\
  \ with a raised brow ridge.</p> \n      <p>“Three of them, definitely following\
  \ us. Short, maybe korasha. Facial tattoos.”</p> \n      <p>“Golden League?” Obozaya\
  \ asked.</p> \n      <p>Zemir shrugged. “I don’t know the local families well enough\
  \ to hazard a guess. Would Golden League assassins be likely to want you dead?”\
  </p> \n      <p>Obozaya shook her head once, firmly, while unclipping the safety\
  \ strap from her stellar cannon. Zemir bit his lower lip, though his mask concealed\
  \ the expression. If they weren’t Xun assassins, then they were most likely just\
  \ robbers, possibly drawn by his own obvious good taste in equipment. In that was\
  \ the case, Obozaya and he could likely deal with them if it came to a fight, but\
  \ likely not without getting ejected from the market for getting flechette holes\
  \ in nearby shops. And even if he could talk their way out of expulsion, the shop\
  \ they were headed to for supplies might close for the day if there was talk of\
  \ a brawl in the street</p> \n      <p>Of course if they <i>were</i> robbers, their\
  \ main motivation would be to make a quick credit in a shakedown.</p> \n      <p>Zemir\
  \ put a hand on Obozaya’s arm. “Follow my lead.” </p>\n      <p>Her brow ridge went\
  \ up even higher, but she nodded. Just as the three tattooed pursuers rounded the\
  \ corner, Zemir stepped into the street and turned to face Obozaya.</p> \n     \
  \ <p>“NOW you want your back pay?”</p> \n      <p>Obozaya was clearly surprised,\
  \ but covered it quickly enough, especially since all eyes were on Zemir. She growled\
  \ at him, which he hoped was just her way of playing along.</p> \n      <p>“I’m\
  \ mortgaged to the hilt!” Zemir let exasperation leak into his voice. “I’ve even\
  \ been reduced to wearing cheap knock-off fashion. Not a thing on me is worth a\
  \ tenth its appearance. And since the family disowned me, I can’t turn to them for\
  \ support!”</p> \n      <p>At first the squat ruffians simply stood in shock and\
  \ stared at Zemir complaining to his apparent bodyguard, but as he continued to\
  \ describe the dire straits of his finances, and lack of extended family, their\
  \ expressions went from shock to sour. About the time he claimed he could pay Obozaya\
  \ in a week, when his next loan came through, the lashuntas—he’d seen at least one\
  \ antenna, so they must be lashuntas—turned as a group and trundled back the way\
  \ they’d come.</p> \n      <p>Once Zemir was sure they were out of earshot, he stopped\
  \ whining.</p> \n      <p>Obozaya chuckled. “Not how I’d have handled it, but effective.\
  \ But aren’t you worried word will get out that you‘re broke, and merchants will\
  \ refuse to talk to you?”</p> \n      <p>Zemir shrugged. “If we needed high-end\
  \ or custom goods that you can only buy with an appointment, maybe. All we need\
  \ are more filter masks. When we show the paramilitary surplus dealer our credits,\
  \ he won’t care about rumors.”</p> \n      <p>Obozaya seemed satisfied, and began\
  \ making her way toward the surplus shop again. “That taken care of... what was\
  \ the second reason you’re not using your environmental seals?”</p> \n      <p>Zemir’\
  s mask kept his predatory grin from being obvious, but his eyes did sparkle.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>“I want to know this miasma well enough that I can grab a cloud of\
  \ it from another iteration of reality. If I ever need to flood a room with it,\
  \ anyone unfamiliar with the stench is in for quite the shock.”</p> \n      <hr>\
