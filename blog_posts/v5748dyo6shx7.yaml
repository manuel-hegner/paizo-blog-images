  \   </div> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">As the white-bearded\
  \ man casually strolled across the rainy courtyard, shadowy figures kept pace with\
  \ him atop the buildings surrounding the square. The older man didn’t seem aware\
  \ of the dark shapes stalking him, first from a distance, then closer, along his\
  \ path. Nor did he show surprise when the ruffians stepped out of the shadows, blades\
  \ glinting. The tallest of the black-clad figures spoke with a low growl.</p> \n\
  \     <p>“Shouldn’t have gotten involved in War Hounder business, old man. We don’\
  t like folks asking questions about our dealings!”</p> \n     <p><em>“Well,</em>”\
  \ Ezren thought to himself, “<em>it’s about time</em>.”</p> \n     <p>Though confident\
  \ in his preparations, the wizard still summoned some basic defenses as the War\
  \ Hounders cautiously approached. A mage’s armor was, in his opinion, properly made\
  \ of magic. He layered a <em>shield</em> spell atop it for good measure.</p> \n\
  \     <p>One of the ruffians flung a dagger at Ezren as the rest moved to cut off\
  \ his escape routes… which he had no intention of taking.</p> \n     <p>“I’ve been\
  \ trying to get your attention for some time,” Ezren said calmly as the knife bounced\
  \ off his arcane shield. Unsurprisingly, the War Hounders ignored him. Ezren knew\
  \ they were aware of his wizardly training and understood their desire to take him\
  \ out quickly. If this had been a remotely fair fight, they’d be doing the right\
  \ thing. </p> \n     <p>Ezren did his best to avoid “fair” fights, though. A fair\
  \ fight was the result of poor research, and he prided himself on his scholarship.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>His two fastest attackers were a scarred human and a dwarf; each wielding\
  \ sword and dagger. Ezren reviewed a range of possible replies before settling on\
  \ a simple lightning cantrip. Not fully powered, something in the mid-range he knew\
  \ they’d survive. He wanted to deliver a message and getting the dead to deliver\
  \ messages was more… problematic.</p> \n     <p>Ezren concentrated on the essence\
  \ of lightning as he performed word and gesture to express that essence. Electricity\
  \ jolted from his open hand, arcing first to the human and then the dwarf. Neither\
  \ was quick enough to avoid his spell. The dwarf fell to the ground, flopping about\
  \ like a fish trapped in a tide pool. The human grunted and raised his sword… as\
  \ Merisiel’s thrown dagger buried itself in the back of his skull.</p> \n     <p>Ezren\
  \ was not so foolish as to provoke a guild of thieves without backup, and it was\
  \ gratifying to see the remaining War Hounders look stunned at Merisiel’s dramatic\
  \ entrance. A moment later, it was Ezren’s turn to be surprised as a fifth War Hounder,\
  \ a cloaked woman with two long daggers, launched herself between Merisiel and the\
  \ fallen dwarf.</p> \n     <p>The situation was still in hand… for now.</p> \n \

  \ \n     <br> \n     <p>“I know you can’t answer my questions.” Ezren’s sounded\
  \ calm as he turned in place, his cane held high to ward off the two-handed sword\
  \ blow from the War Hounder who’d been trying to sneak up behind him. “But when\
  \ you flee back to the Pyramid of the Dog, I want you to deliver your master a message.”\
  </p> \n     <p>The cloaked woman began dragging the dwarf’s twitching body back\
  \ into the shadows, tiny sparks of electricity continuing to bound off him across\
  \ the worn road’s shallow puddles. The attacker with the greatsword swung it again,\
  \ trying to cut Ezren in half with an attack powerful enough to force the wizard\
  \ to expend his arcane shield to counter it. Merisiel threw another dagger into\
  \ an apparently empty space… and the empty space grunted and spattered blood on\
  \ the street.</p> \n     <p>“I’d have sent a courier requesting an audience, but\
  \ none seemed willing to deliver my message, and I haven’t had any luck with public\
  \ notices.”</p> \n     <p>Ezren formed a new eldritch concept in his mind, and colors\
  \ sprayed out from his cane, hitting the greatsword-wielder full in the face. The\
  \ attacker’s eyes took on the same rainbow colors, and the scoundrel dropped his\
  \ sword as he staggered away unsteadily. The cloaked woman finished dragging her\
  \ fallen comrade out of sight, and Merisiel positioned herself to watch his back.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Ezren turned slowly, scanning the open square. The blinded War Hounder\
  \ was wandering aimlessly but could become a threat again within a minute or so.\
  \ The woman and dwarf were out of sight but could potentially be maneuvering to\
  \ make another assault. Merisiel would warn him if that were to happen. There was\
  \ another man…</p> \n     <p>At the edge of the square, a man clad in brown and\
  \ green lurked in the shadows. His drab clothing actually blended into the backdrop\
  \ of Absalom’s Puddles District better than the pure black of his compatriots. He\
  \ was bald with a full beard. He studied Ezren with a stern expression, single dagger\
  \ in hand, though he was well out of stabbing range. The War Hounder could, of course,\
  \ throw his blade. Or perhaps he knew some occult secret with which to blast Ezren’\
  s mind. </p> \n     <p>Trusting Merisiel to handle any other unforeseen threats\
  \ from behind, Ezren turned to face the bald man.</p> \n     <p>“You are, I take\
  \ it, in charge?”</p> \n     <p>The bald man waved a hand in casual denial. “I wouldn’\
  t say that. We aren’t strict in terms of rank or command, you see? More accurate\
  \ to say I’m wise enough not to be on the front line when confronting a wizard of\
  \ your… reputation.”</p> \n     <p>Ezren nodded in acknowledgment, though he suspected\
  \ the bald man had no idea who he was or what reputation he might possess. </p>\
  \ \n     <p>“May I assume,” asked Ezren, eyes still scanning for the missing dwarf,\
  \ “that if I were to ask you to carry a message to the oldest and wisest of the\
  \ War Hounders, you could see that it was received?”</p> \n     <p>“I’d be delighted.”\
  \ The bald man looked anything but delighted, but Ezren believed his message would\
  \ be delivered.</p> \n     <p>As Ezren was about to reply, the War Hounder who’\
  d dropped the greatsword snapped out of his befuddlement. He looked back and forth\
  \ between the wizard and the bald man. Merisiel was nowhere to be seen, but Ezren\
  \ knew she was nearby. He kicked the dropped greatsword toward his assailant who,\
  \ upon receiving a nod from the bald man, picked up his weapon and rushed to stand\
  \ beside his ally.</p> \n     <p>“I would <em>very</em> much like to know,” said\
  \ Ezren with as much iron as he could put in his voice, “what became of the papers\
  \ and effects of Nessian. Further, I represent a buyer who would pay well for them,\
  \ if they remain in War Hounder possession.”</p> \n     <p>The bald man tried to\
  \ look impassive, but his eyes showed a hint of surprise. Then he nodded again,\
  \ and gestured for the larger warrior to head out of the courtyard.</p> \n     <p>“\
  I assure you, that message shall be delivered.” </p> \n     <p>And with that he\
  \ followed after the taller man, both of whom were quickly enveloped by shadows.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Ezren smiled as he headed back toward the inn he was staying at in the\
  \ Foreign Quarter. He made sure to walk slowly so he could easily be followed, trusting\
  \ Merisiel to prevent further assaults. He suspected when the War Hounders attacked\
  \ him again tonight, they’d bring someone who could answer his questions.</p> \n\
  \     <p>And tonight at the inn, he and Merisiel wouldn’t be alone to receive them.</p>\
