  \ class=\"PTales\"></div></a> \n   <h1>Fingers of Death—No, Doom!</h1> \n   <p>by\
  \ Lucien Soulban</p> \n   <h2>Chapter Four: Caught Red-Handed</h2> \n   <p>\"We\
  \ let them out!\" Fife said, his voice edged with panic. They dashed through the\
  \ tall grass, Fife following in Darvin's wake.</p> \n   <p>\"You can't be sure of\
  \ that,\" Darvin said, though he suspected the truth of it.</p> \n   <p>\"We've\
  \ as good as killed that village!\"</p> \n   <p>\"Fife,\" Darvin said, spinning\
  \ around to grab his brother by the shoulders, but the halfling ran a good dozen\
  \ paces behind the longer-legged human. Darvin dropped his hands. \"By the Gods,\
  \ your voice carries.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Darvin!\" Fife protested.</p> \n   <p>\"Fife,\"\
  \ Darvin warned, and kept pace with the halfling as he whipped by. \"As you said,\
  \ the creatures had already venturing out to slit the throats of farmers. They could\
  \ leave the manse.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Then why not kill everyone?\" Fife said, \"I'll\
  \ tell you why. Because they only murdered those who stole from their master. But\
  \ once you broke the seal on the door...\"</p> \n   <p>\"So it's my fault?\" Darvin\
  \ demanded.</p> \n   <p>\"You just had to kick down the door.\"</p> \n   <p>\"It\
  \ was in the way!\"</p> \n   <p>\"It had a handle!\"</p> \n   <p>\"Oh.\" Darvin\
  \ slowed down a touch. \"That part won't be in the tales, will it?\"</p> \n   <p>\"\
  Come on, you egomaniacal yak!\"</p> \n   <p>The pair had reached the stables on\
  \ the edge of the village, the Andoren draft horses within snorting and tramping\
  \ the ground in their anxiety. All around them, shouts and cries of terror sounded\
  \ from villagers driven out of their homes by the things that crawled through their\
  \ windows. Villagers gripped pitchforks and sickles tightly, a few hefting rusting\
  \ blades of a more martial nature.</p> \n   <p>Too much, Darvin thought. He slowed\
  \ and stopped, the horror of it driving stakes through his feet. He watched numbly\
  \ as Fife ran to people, trying to get them to move, to act, to do something to\
  \ pierce the same fear that poisoned Darvin. Nobody heard the halfling, however;\
  \ to them all he was a child to be set aside with both hands, even when he kicked\
  \ and pulled the crawling thing off a terrified farmer who rolled around in the\
  \ dirt.</p> \n   <p>Fife looked to Darvin for help, but Darvin backed away—one step,\
  \ then two before he forced himself to stop. Only one thing mattered, he forced\
  \ his fear-addled brain to concede. Only one person.</p> \n   <p>Darvin grabbed\
  \ Fife by the shoulder.</p> \n   <p>\"We have to go,\" Darvin whispered, and began\
  \ pulling Fife along as the halfling bucked and screamed...</p> \n   <p></p>\n \
  \  <center>\n    ∗∗∗\n   </center>\n   <p></p> \n   <p> \"No, Darv!\" Fife said,\
  \ trying to free himself from his brother's iron grip.</p> \n   <p>\"Come on,\"\
  \ Darvin said, hoarsely, pulling the struggling halfling against his will.</p> \n\
  \   <p>\"No! Stop!\"</p> \n   <p>\"We have to go!\" Darvin shouted, dragging Fife\
  \ off his feet, but the halfling managed to jerk away, ripping his shirt in the\
  \ process.</p> \n   <p>\"We have to save them,\" Fife said, staring up into his\
  \ brother's eyes.</p> \n   <p>\"We can't!\" Darvin said, looking around.</p> \n\
  \   <p>Fife hesitated a moment. \"Darvin, the hero of the Mad Necromancer's Wars,\
  \ pulled his trusted blade from its sheath.\"</p> \n   <p>\"What?\" Darvin said,\
  \ blinking.</p> \n   <p>\"He set his eyes upon the imperiled village, ready to leap\
  \ into—\"</p> \n   <p>\"What are you doing?\" Darvin said.</p> \n   <p>\"In—into\
  \ the fray,\" Fife continued staring all around him as cries shot from the shadows\
  \ like arrows.</p> \n   <p>\"Stop it! That's just make-believe,\" Darvin shouted.\
  \ \"This isn't one of your blasted stories!\"</p> \n   <p>\"Everything's a story!\"\
  \ Fife shouted back with a voice that felt ready to tear itself apart. \"Who says\
  \ my stories aren't the ones we haven't lived yet?\"</p> \n   <p>Darvin stared down\
  \ at the halfling as though studying an alien, unfathomable thing. Then suddenly,\
  \ he shook his head, his eyes focusing. \"By the gods, you are mad.\"</p> \n   <p>\"\
  Only a little,\" Fife said, smiling sadly. Then he continued. \"Darvin, hero of\
  \ the Mad Necromancer's Wars and champion of plump maidens, princesses, and swordswomen\
  \ everywhere, unsheathed his trusted blade and leapt into the fray....\"</p> \n\
  \   <p>A small smile flickered on Darvin's lips. He inhaled sharply. \"Right. Hero.\
  \ Just make sure it's a suitably epic recounting.\" Then he darted into the crowd,\
  \ forcibly pulling the men and women into fighting circles around the children.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Fife nodded gratefully and then set to kicking and stabbing at the hands\
  \ that scrabbled after them. A handful of villagers fought to remove a hand about\
  \ the throat of another man—the merchant Cullins, Fife realized. Harvander was nowhere\
  \ to be seen. Perhaps he was already dead, or fled.</p> \n   <p>The halfling gripped\
  \ his small dirk tighter and ran toward the men. He jostled for place and edged\
  \ the blade for the hand about Cullins' throat. The bladed fingers were squirming\
  \ for the merchant's jugular.</p> \n   <p>\"No, you'll hurt him!\" someone yelled,\
  \ but Fife ignored him. He deftly sliced the first dorsal tendon between the thumb\
  \ and forefinger, and the hand came loose easily. The men stamped it into the ground\
  \ as Cullins coughed for breath. He rose to his feet with a heavy hand on Fife's\
  \ shoulder and checked his neck with the other. It bled, but not so fiercely that\
  \ he'd die.</p> \n   <p>Fife looked around, desperate for a solution as they ran\
  \ for the nearest circle of armed farmers. The hands darted in and out of the shadows\
  \ of the buildings, nicking and slicing with their blades before vanishing again.\
  \ Several bodies lay where they had fallen, still and no longer bleeding. Others\
  \ crawled or were dragged to safety, and yet the hands galloped fearlessly on the\
  \ tips of their sometimes broken digits, eager for mayhem, unfeeling of pain.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>The realization thundered inside Fife like a storm overtaking the plains.\
  \ He grabbed Cullins' arm just as they reached the circle of men and women.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"Is the temple sanctified?\" Fife asked.</p> \n   <p>\"Well, the priest\
  \ diddled Farmer Hoskin's daughter there,\" one of the men added helpfully.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"Once!\" a slender, bearded farmer (who Fife could only assume was Hoskins)\
  \ replied.</p> \n   <p>Cullins ignored the other. \"It should be,\" he said.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"Get everyone there. Go! It should protect you!\"</p> \n   <p>Cullins\
  \ nodded and shouted at the others to join him as they ran for the simple stone\
  \ building at the crest of a small hill. Fife let them go and turned back into the\
  \ town to find his brother.</p> \n   <p></p>\n   <center>\n    ∗∗∗\n   </center>\n\
  \   <p></p> \n   <p> Darvin knew he was no hero, but argue that with the adrenaline\
  \ coursing through his veins. He noticed the villagers running for the hill, the\
  \ cry carrying through the crowd to \"Fight your way to the temple!\" Though instinct\
  \ screamed at him to run, Darvin helped with the retreating stragglers, fending\
  \ off the hands that leapt and flew at them.</p> \n   <p>He heard a cry from a nearby\
  \ house—a woman's voice, or perhaps a child's. Two men glanced at the home, but\
  \ continued retreating. Darvin wanted to join them, but forced himself to remember\
  \ Fife's words.</p> \n   <p>\"Darvin, hero of the Mad Necromancer's Wars...\" he\
  \ muttered. The phrase was oddly comforting. He ran for the doorway, crushing a\
  \ hand that scampered near—far too near—under a hard boot.</p> \n   <p>The unlit,\
  \ one-room, wood-and-mud home lay disheveled. Straw bedding was scattered underfoot,\
  \ the stone hearth gasping out its last ember warmth. Backed into the far corner,\
  \ a young woman grabbed whatever lay in reach—wood figurines, serving plates, clay\
  \ cups—and lobbed them at the three hands that advanced on her like a pack of jackals.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Darvin acted before he could talk himself out of it, stabbing the closest\
  \ hand perched on the small table through with his blade. The impaled hand wriggled\
  \ and jerked on the end of his dagger, and the other pair turned on him instantly.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Furiously trying to whip the dying hand off his dagger, Darvion grabbed\
  \ the table and flipped it over between him and the advancing monstrosities. It\
  \ barely slowed the pair down as they sprang over the wood.</p> \n   <p>One hand\
  \ leapt for Darvin's shin, nicking it as he tried to sidestep. Hot pain flared up\
  \ his body and his pant leg grew wet; he fell backward as the other hand tried to\
  \ run between his splayed legs.</p> \n   <p>Darvin slammed his foot down again and\
  \ again on the nearest hand, trying to crush it, then settled for pressing it down\
  \ into the floor with his heel. The impaled hand continued to jerk at the end of\
  \ his blade, and Darvin slammed the dagger into the ground, pinning the monster\
  \ to the irregular slats of the wooden floor. But he'd lost track of the third hand\
  \ that had drawn blood while the one under heel struggled to free itself.</p> \n\
  \   <p>Darvin couldn't move. He heard something behind him and craned his head around\
  \ as a shadow moved in the corner of his eye. Fife materialized into view like a\
  \ ghost, stabbing the third hand through with his dagger, continuing to slam his\
  \ tiny blade home until it stopped moving.</p> \n   <p>\"Help me,\" Darvin said\
  \ as he struggled to kick the trapped hand under heel with his other boot, pain\
  \ shooting along his wounded leg. Fife set about helping Darvin dispatch the two\
  \ pinned creatures before both men had a chance to stop, breathe, and finally stare\
  \ at the wide-shouldered, wide-hipped woman huddling in the corner.</p> \n   <p>\"\
  A plump maiden,\" Fife whispered to him. \"I told you my stories just hadn't happened\
  \ yet.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Indeed,\" Darvin said, grinning at the woman and straightening\
  \ his clothing.</p> \n   <p></p>\n   <center>\n    ∗∗∗\n   </center>\n   <p></p>\
  \ \n   <div class=\"blurb360\">\n    <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Darvin.jpg\"\
  \ border=\"0\">\n    <br> \"Perhaps Darvin might one day prove a hero after all.\"\
  \n   </div> \n   <p>As Fife suspected, the hands couldn't cross the temple's threshold.\
  \ And slowly, the men and women of the village dispatched the single-minded hands,\
  \ with rocks, pitchforks, and scythes.</p> \n   <p>When Darvin and Fife approached\
  \ the temple gate with the woman, however, Cullins stepped in the way and whispered,\
  \ \"You two best be going.\"</p> \n   <p>Fife, full of heroic charge and heart thundering\
  \ with nervous excitement, said, \"But we just saved you!\"</p> \n   <p>Cullins\
  \ studied the halfling, his eyes hard. \"You brought those creatures here, did you\
  \ not?\"</p> \n   <p>Fife and Darvin exchanged quick glances. \"Not deliberately,\"\
  \ Fife said. \"And they were already escaping before, weren't they? Because the\
  \ townsfolk looted the manor.\"</p> \n   <p>\"You sent us there,\" Darvin said quietly,\
  \ a dangerous new note in his voice. \"You have equal guilt in this.\"</p> \n  \
  \ <p>Cullins nodded. \"Perhaps,\" he said, looking at the bewildered villagers.\
  \ \"But you're outsiders here. This is the only courtesy I can give you. Go, before\
  \ they regain their senses enough to blame you for this mess. Frightened people\
  \ do that.\"</p> \n   <p>Fife wanted to argue more, but he felt Darvin's hand on\
  \ his shoulder. \"Let's go,\" Darvin said.</p> \n   <p></p>\n   <center>\n    ∗∗\
  ∗\n   </center>\n   <p></p> \n   <p>Dawn touched the horizon, a passing glimpse\
  \ of what the day could be, and Darvin watched his brother carefully. The halfling\
  \ had a tendency to brood, weighed down by his thoughts and crushed by self-criticism.\
  \ Unlike most people with his disposition, however, Fife had turned that brooding\
  \ into a fine art, and Darvin could see the parables of disappointment in his brother's\
  \ stories, the roads of regret for paths not taken except, perhaps, in longing dreams\
  \ and sidelong glances. The business of the village weighed even heavier on him\
  \ for that.</p> \n   <p>Darvin nudged Fife.</p> \n   <p>\"What?\" the halfling demanded\
  \ sourly.</p> \n   <p>\"Are you getting shorter?\" Darvin said.</p> \n   <p>\"What?\"\
  </p> \n   <p>\"Isn't that how it works with halflings? The older you are, the shorter\
  \ you get?\"</p> \n   <p>\"Are you mad, you self-involved moose?\"</p> \n   <p>Darvin\
  \ shrugged. \"Then maybe it's just you,\" he said cheerfully, and continued onward\
  \ despite the pain in his bandaged leg.</p> \n   <p></p>\n   <center>\n    ∗∗∗\n\
  \   </center>\n   <p></p> \n   <p>They walked in silence a bit further, Fife glaring\
  \ up at Darvin. The human's chirpy attitude and perpetual grin suggested that all\
  \ trouble was destined to flow off his back. But Fife knew better. His brother needed\
  \ anchors in this world, an emotional connection to guide his feet along the path.\
  \ Darvin tended to hurdle obstacles, attracted by bright shiny things, almost entirely\
  \ self-involved. The number of times Darvin nearly got himself killed staggered\
  \ and frightened Fife. If Fife hadn't been there, to give Darvin pause, to remind\
  \ his brother that they shared in the repercussions of Darvin's actions, then Darvin\
  \ would have suffered for his enthusiasms. For that alone, Fife was glad to be a\
  \ burden that only brothers shared.</p> \n   <p>Still, it didn't mean that his brother\
  \ didn't get on his nerves occasionally.</p> \n   <p>A wicked thought occurred to\
  \ him.</p> \n   <p>\"Say, Darvin,\" Fife asked casually, \"do you know what the\
  \ word ‘incontinent' means?\"</p> \n   <p>\"Sure,\" Darvin replied. \"It means spanning\
  \ multiple continents, right?\"</p> \n   <p>\"Absolutely. I was thinking that my\
  \ next story of your adventures might involve some jungle exploration in Garund.\"\
  </p> \n   <p>Darvin grinned broadly and gripped the halfling about the shoulders.\
  \ \"See, that's why you're the writer!\"</p> \n   <p>Fife nodded. \"And you the\
  \ hero,\" he said. \"Oops—I meant the incontinent hero.\"</p> \n   <p>Darvin accepted\
  \ the title with a bow and a flourish, and the pair continued on toward the next\
  \ town, the rehearsing of another tall tale under way.</p> \n   <p><b>Coming Next\
