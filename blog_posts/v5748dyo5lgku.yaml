  >One book I've wanted to put out for as long as I've worked at Paizo has been a\
  \ gazetteer of different ships one could find in the Inner Sea region. Because ships\
  \ are mobile, a ship of any type can be found in just about any port, opening up\
  \ nearly endless options for Game Masters.</p> \n    <p>When <a href=\"/products/btpy991v\"\
  ><i>Ships of the Inner Sea</i></a> finally made it onto the production schedule\
  \ instead of my wish list, I wanted to make sure that the book could serve GMs in\
  \ a number of ways. The included ships, of which there are seven, range in challenge\
  \ rating from foes appropriate for parties of levels ranging from 4 to 15, and are\
  \ thus useful additions to all sorts of adventures. For those running the <a href=\"\
  /pathfinder/adventurePath/skullAndShackles\">Skull &amp; Shackles Adventure Path</a>\
  \ or otherwise using the ship-to-ship combat system presented in the <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8rwc\"><i>Skull &amp; Shackles Player's Guide</i></a>, each ship includes\
  \ statistics compatible with the system, allowing all seven vessels to be potential\
  \ prey for pirate PCs prowling the Fever Sea. Each ship is fully mapped (and gorgeously\
  \ so, by Jared Blando) for tactical combat and can be used as a potential PC or\
  \ enemy vessel. While the crew compliment of each vessel is enough to fill a book\
  \ by itself, each ship's chapter includes full statistics for its captain, one prominent\
  \ crewmember, and a generic sailor or passenger stat block.</p> \n    <p>To provide\
  \ more useful and general tools for GMs running nautical campaigns, we also included\
  \ a chapter on sailing the Inner Sea. This includes a glossary of nautical terms,\
  \ definitions of several different ship classes, and details on the region's most\
  \ traveled trade routes and the hazards that make them full of adventure potential.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Three of the authors who worked on the book live or have lived on functioning\
  \ boats, including naval vessels. Their knowledge of nautical terms, ship layouts\
  \ and life at sea really shows in their writing, and I was very lucky to be able\
  \ to get them all together for the project. It's the same reason we had Sutter write\
  \ about space aliens and Wes write about Infernal contracts; you're best at writing\
  \ what you know.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"http://static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderCampaignSetting/PZO9274-KrakenSpite.jpg\"\

  \ type: a half-page introduction, a ship portrait, and a full-body illustration.\
