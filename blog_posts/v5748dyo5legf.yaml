  /image/content/Blog/20130214-Ryan_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\">\n     </div> \n     <p>I've\
  \ tinkered with games ever since I was 8 years old and tried to make a solitaire\
  \ variant of Monopoly. (Spoiler: it was pretty awful.) In 2007, people started giving\
  \ me money to make and edit roleplaying games, and I became a full-time game designer\
  \ and editor in 2012. You might know me from various Evil Hat Productions or Margaret\
  \ Weis Productions products, various indie RPGs, my years of game podcasting, or\
  \ various places on the Internet where I've been prone to mouth off.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>Outside of playing tabletop RPGs, I'll throw down when it comes to playing\
  \ deckbuilding games, almost anything BioWare makes, and novel iOS games... though\
  \ my favorite game by far is called \"drinking scotch.\" If you want find out more\
  \ probably useless stuff about me (with the occasional piece of accidental wisdom),\
  \ visit my blog at <a href=\"http://ryanmacklin.com\" target=\"_blank\">RyanMacklin.com</a>.\
  \ Or follow him on Twitter, @RyanMacklin. Don't worry, I won't share that horrible\
  \ solitaire Monopoly variant.</p> \n     <p>Ryan Macklin<br> <i>Editor</i></p> \n\
