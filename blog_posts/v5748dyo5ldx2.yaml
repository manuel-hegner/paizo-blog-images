  \ itemprop=\"description\">Usually, I try to spread out international Pathfinder\
  \ Society blogs to every 3–4 weeks. However, with one sitting in my inbox, I didn’\
  t want to just hold onto it for a month. I had the pleasure of meeting Venture-Captain\
  \ Karim Majeri at PaizoCon UK in July. Not only did I meet him, but I was able to\
  \ GM a game for him and several other international Venture-Captains and Venture-Lieutenants.\
  \ I will just say that it was a very entertaining session of #3–25: Storming the\
  \ Diamond Gate. The Pathfinder Society organization in France is lucky in that they\
  \ are one of the three international regions that have Pathfinder RPG books translated\
  \ into their native language. This allows us to provide convention prize support\
  \ with French Pathfinder books. Karim was also kind enough to bring me several French\
  \ Pathfinder books, and the French Core Rulebook sits in my collection as one of\
  \ my favorite pieces.</span></p> \n    <p>Karim also is supported by Venture-Lieutenant\
  \ Benoit Gros in Geneva, Switzerland. I also met Benoit at PaizoCon UK, and between\
  \ them, I suspect we will see significant growth in France in the coming year.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Without further ado, I present to you Karim’s report on Pathfinder France.</p>\
  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>I’m Karim Majeri, the Venture-Captain for France\
  \ and surrounding French-speaking countries. I started to play Pathfinder RPG with\
  \ the Beta version, while at the same time running a Rise of the Runelord Adventure\
  \ Path campaign. Besides serving as a Venture-Captain for Pathfinder Society Organized\
  \ Play, I am also president of the Ligue Ludique, an association that promotes RPGs,\
  \ in particular D&amp;D and Pathfinder. The organization is based in Paris. We are\
  \ currently coordinating more than 150 events per year, including large conventions\
  \ that include Comic Con Paris, Monde du Jeu, Paris est Ludique, MayCon, and LudikXPerience\
  \ (our own convention).</p> \n     <p>The first Pathfinder Society event hosted\
  \ in France was several years ago. Past Pathfinder Society Campaign Coordinator\
  \ Joshua Frost attended an event in Lyon in the summer of 2010. Since that game\
  \ day, we have hosted numerous full Saturdays with many players in Lyon and in Paris.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>We are currently running many demos and campaigns in different shops\
  \ in Paris, including my own shop, La Carte Chance, located in the northern district\
  \ of Paris. I have taken the lead and recruited and trained quite a few new GMs\
  \ on how to run Pathfinder Society games. I’ve also created <a href=\"http://www.ligueludique.fr/index.php/jeux-de-roles/pathfinder-dd375/pathfinder-society.html\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">a dedicated webpage in French for French players who want to\
  \ start playing Pathfinder Society</a>.</p> \n     <p>Here in France, we have a\
  \ strong community of fans and you can find out much information from different\
  \ sources. Of course, we have the Ligue Ludique website mentioned above, but we\
  \ also have <a href=\"http://www.pathfinder-fr.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Pathfinder-FR</a>\
  \ (with a wiki, a forum and a lot of other information); PSOP, a website that collects\
  \ your sessions and characters’ info; and finally the <a href=\"http://www.black-book-editions.fr/index.php?site_id=59\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Black-Book Editions website</a>, which is the French editor\
  \ for Pathfinder RPG books.</p> \n     <p>The largest events in France and French-speaking\
  \ countries to play Pathfinder Society are Comic Con in Paris the first week of\
  \ July, Octogones in October in Lyon, Festival en Jeu in Belgium, and Imaginaire\
  \ at the end of November in Paris. There are also other conventions and you can\
  \ stay updated on future dates and information at the <a href=\"http://www.ligueludique.fr/index.php/jeux-de-roles/pathfinder-dd375/pathfinder-society.html\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">French PFS website</a> or on the <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/events\"\
  >Paizo event page here at paizo.com</a>.</p> \n     <p>The next step for growing\
  \ Pathfinder Society in France is to find some Venture-Lieutenants throughout different\
  \ regions in France. My hope is they will help promote the game and find new GMs\
  \ for Pathfinder Society. I have found quite a few players and GMs that are very\
  \ motivated, including my new Venture-Lieutenant, Benoit Gros, in Switzerland. I’\
  m currently recruiting for Venture-Lieutenants in or around Lyon, Rennes, Lille,\
  \ Bordeaux, Marseille, and Strasbourg. If you live in or around any of those regions,\
  \ please contact me at <i>webmaster@ligueludique.fr</i>.</p> \n     <p>Last, but\
  \ not the least, after Paizo Con UK (organized by UK Venture-Captain Dave Harrison\
  \ and Venture-Lieutenant Rob Silk), I have been highly motivated to organize a PaizoCon\
  \ France in Paris. The idea is to gather and welcome all the players in Europe together\
  \ in Paris. That’s my new project and I am working with BBE to plan it for the end\
  \ of August or beginning of September 2013. Thanks again to Dave and Rob for the\
  \ great time had at PaizoCon UK and the inspiration for a PaizoCon France.</p> \n\
