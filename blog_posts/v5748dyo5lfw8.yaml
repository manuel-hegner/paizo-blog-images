  \ Preview: Player Proxies</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Friday, February 21, 2014</p>\
  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> <span itemprop=\"description\">As we keep\
  \ marching toward the May release of the <a href=\"/products/btpy92s9\">Reign of\
  \ Winter</a> set of <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids\">Pathfinder\
  \ Battles</a> prepainted plastic figures, I want to take a little break from the\
  \ usual parade of monsters and creepy creatures to focus on four figures that work\
  \ great to model player characters, even if that was not their original intent.</span>\n\
  \    <p></p> \n    <p>One of the coolest things about basing some of our sets on\
  \ our popular <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath\">Pathfinder Adventure Path</a>\
  \ range is that it gives us a chance to include a lot of NPCs. Sometimes, said NPCs\
  \ are ancient crone queens and winter witches, but lots of other times they're adventurers—\
  making them perfect minis to represent your player characters. Reign of Winter has\
  \ a few such figures, and this week I'd love to show them to you.</p> \n    <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71459_PaleTowerGuard_500.jpeg\"\
  > <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71459_PaleTowerGuard_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Here's hoping your player character looks\
  \ a little bit like a guard in a winter fortress. If so, you'll appreciate the Pale\
  \ Tower Guard, a heavily armored warrior type drawn from the pages of the very first\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/reignOfWinter\">Reign of Winter</a> adventure.\
  \ In that adventure, the Pale Tower Guards go door to door looking for the rebel\
  \ Nadya Petska, bringing them into conflict with the player characters. The Pale\
  \ Tower Guard is a Medium, common figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\
  \ <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71459_Nadya_500.jpeg\"> <img src=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71459_Nadya_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"> </a>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>Speaking of Nadya Petska, she's also included in the set, and\
  \ she makes for one of the most gorgeously produced female adventurer figures in\
  \ the whole <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids\">Pathfinder Battles</a>\
  \ range. Because she's such a great figure, and because the rare slots are mostly\
  \ filled with even weirder creatures and NPCs, I decided to slate Nadya Petska into\
  \ the uncommon rarity. She is a Medium figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  > <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71459_Greta_500.jpeg\"> <img src=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71459_Greta_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"> </a>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>Nadya isn't the only awesome female warrior in the set. Here\
  \ we have Greta, a powerfully built barbarian who just happens to be the human form\
  \ of a Winter Wolf. She also happens to be a sweet figure for a human warrior or\
  \ barbarian player character. Greta is Medium, and is also uncommon. Some of you\
  \ will no doubt think that some of these figures should be rares, but I promise\
  \ you the rares in this set are CRAZY, and most of them don't make a ton of sense\
  \ to have in quantity. </p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71459_Ratibor_500.jpeg\"\
  > <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71459_Ratibor_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Our last figure this week is Ratibor the Bold, a\
  \ human barbarian who betrayed the witch queen Baba Yaga and who has been cursed\
  \ to guard her Dancing Hut forevermore. With a bow, shield, axe, and armor, he also\
  \ doubles as a villain, player character, or even a mook. This Medium figure is\
  \ slated at the uncommon rarity.</p> \n    <p>And that's it for this week. Next\
  \ week I think I'll unleash some of the rares to provide a bit more perspective\
  \ on why I decided to make most of these guys uncommon. It will all make perfect\
  \ sense shortly, as we depart the time and space of Golarion to check out some of\
  \ the set's truly WEIRD figures.</p> \n    <p>Until then, I remain…</p> \n    <p>Erik\
