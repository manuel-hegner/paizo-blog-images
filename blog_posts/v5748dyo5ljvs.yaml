  > \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Archetypes are a fascinating example of how\
  \ a game system can evolve over the course of time. The <a href=\"/products/btpy88yj?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Core-Rulebook\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Core Rulebook</em></a> doesn't mention archetypes at all—they weren't\
  \ introduced until the <a href=\"/products/btpy8fo1?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Players-Guide\"\
  ><em>Advanced Player's Guide</em></a>. Once players discovered how useful they were\
  \ to represent characters that weren't a perfect match for any character class,\
  \ but were close enough that only a few changes were necessary to represent them,\
  \ archetypes quickly became an extremely popular and common element of many Pathfinder\
  \ RPG releases from that point forward. They allowed characters to examine new character\
  \ concepts without needing to release whole new classes. A ranger who's an expert\
  \ in tactics and odd tricks but doesn't cast spells isn't a big enough conceptual\
  \ step to need a new character class, but it's difficult to represent without something\
  \ like the skirmisher or trapper archetypes.</p> \n    <p>One of the advantages\
  \ we had when designing Starfinder was that we could see what had worked well for\
  \ Pathfinder and use that as a starting place in design, rather than having to create\
  \ everything conceptually from scratch. It was clear early on that archetypes made\
  \ sense in Starfinder—after all, the game can have adventures set anywhere in an\
  \ entire galaxy, so there are bound to be cultures, traditions, organizations, and\
  \ training methods which adjust how characters do things beyond the influence of\
  \ their class, race, and theme. That let us look at how we wanted themes, classes,\
  \ archetypes, and feat selections to interact. So what sets archetypes apart from\
  \ those other character variables? Let's look at what the <a href=\"/products/btpy9ssr?Starfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Starfinder-Core-Rulebook\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em></a> says about archetypes.</p> \n    <blockquote>\
  \ \n     <p><i>An archetype is a character concept more specific and involved than\
  \ a theme, but not as comprehensive or broad as a class. Each archetype represents\
  \ a significant divergence from the abilities of a typical member of the core classes.\
  \ Archetypes provide an additional layer of control for players who want to fine-tune\
  \ their character's advancement. An archetype generally grants abilities that aren't\
  \ otherwise available to characters through a class, or it may grant easier access\
  \ to a specific set of appropriate abilities. In general, these abilities aren't\
  \ tied to the background of any one core class or theme and aren't available to\
  \ characters via other sources.</i></p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurb180\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7101-StarfinderExplorer.jpg\"\

  \ \n     <p><i>Illustration by Mirco Paganessi</i></p>\n    </div> \n    <p>So Starfinder\
  \ is using archetypes as sets of class features that represent a concept that isn't\
  \ tied to any one class, but shouldn't be available to every character simply by\
  \ taking a set of feats. Unlike Pathfinder archetypes, which must be designed for\
  \ a single specific character class it can be added to, Starfinder archetypes are\
  \ designed to be applicable to any character class. Each class has specific class\
  \ features it gives up at set levels (2nd, 4th, 6th, 9th, 12th, and 18th) if the\
  \ archetype provides an alternative class feature at that level (though not every\
  \ archetype will need to have alternate class features at all those levels). An\
  \ archetype thus becomes part of the class you attach it to, and that class loses\
  \ a pre-determined ability at the levels the archetype grants you an alternative.\
  \ For example, the <em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em> has two archetypes—the phrenic\
  \ adept and the Starfinder forerunner. The phrenic adept has alternate class features\
  \ at every level it can—2nd, 4th, 6th, 9th, 12th, and 18th—while the Starfinder\
  \ forerunner only provides alternate class features at 2nd, 4th, and 6th.</p> \n\
  \    <p>You must decide to add an archetype to a class when you gain the first class\
  \ level at which the archetype has an alternate class feature. For example, the\
  \ Starfinder forerunner archetype grants its first alternate class feature (trained\
  \ for trouble) at 2nd level. So if you take a second level of a class, and decide\
  \ to add the Starfinder forerunner archetype, you gain trained for trouble as a\
  \ class feature. What you give up depends on what class you took—a mechanic that\
  \ gains the archetype would not receive the mechanic trick normally available at\
  \ 2nd level, while a mystic would gain 1 fewer spells known for the highest level\
  \ of spell it can cast, and so on. Every class outlines what class feature it forgoes\
  \ if it has an archetype added that has an alternate class feature at that level.\
  \ Each class you take can have at most one archetype attached to it, and you cannot\
  \ attach the same archetype to more than one class if you multiclass.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>Archetypes are designed to represent sets of abilities you could reasonably\
  \ gain regardless of your class or theme, but that involve some sort of special\
  \ circumstance or training that makes them bad choices as feats. The phrenic adept\
  \ assumes you have gained some innate psychic powers, as a result of natural mutation,\
  \ specialized training, exposure to an ill-understood force such as an alien artifact,\
  \ and so on. The Starfinder forerunner represents the result of special training\
  \ given to members of the Starfinder Society who do advanced work to prepare for\
  \ Starfinder expeditions, and often serve as guides on such expeditions. Neither\
  \ is designed to be as all-encompassing as a full character class, but both represent\
  \ more new abilities than should be contained in 1 or 2 feats. As the Starfinder\
  \ RPG grows, we'll be looking for places it makes sense for a new option to be more\
  \ than a feat or theme but less than a class, and then using archetypes to make\
  \ those available to characters of any class.</p> \n    <p>As a preview of what\
  \ archetype features look like, here is the ability gained by the phrenic adept\
  \ at 4th level.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><b>Phrenic Defense (Ex)</b>: Your\
  \ psychic powers give you additional defenses against mental attacks. The first\
  \ time you fail a saving throw against a spell or effect with the emotion, fear,\
  \ mind-affecting, or pain descriptor (see page 269), you can spend 1 Resolve Point\
  \ as a reaction to immediately reroll the failed saving throw.</p> \n     <p>Even\
  \ if the second saving throw fails, your stronger defenses might reduce the effect\
  \ of the spell or ability. If the spell or ability deals damage, reduce the damage\
  \ done by an amount equal to your class level. If the spell or ability has a duration\
  \ of 2 rounds or longer, reduce its duration by half.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n\
