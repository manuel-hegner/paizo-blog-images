  \ Future of Pathfinder Society Organized Play, Part XIII: PaizoCon Success!!!</h1>\
  \ \n    <p class=\"date\">Monday, June 13, 2011</p> \n    <p>For hundreds of avid\
  \ Pathfinder Society players, this past weekend likely produced countless memories\
  \ that won't soon be forgotten. This weekend, after all, was PaizoCon, and one of\
  \ the pillars of the show was the wide array of Pathfinder Society games and special\
  \ events being run from Friday morning through Sunday afternoon.</p> \n    <p>We\
  \ planned for 16 active tables each slot and ended up pulling in extra GMs for nearly\
  \ every one, filling as many as 21 tables on Saturday morning. While there were\
  \ lines of hopeful players filling the hallway outside the four PFS gaming rooms\
  \ each slot, Hyrum and I are proud to say that not a single gamer was turned away\
  \ from Pathfinder Society play who showed up within 15 minutes of the start of a\
  \ slot. In total, we had nearly 80 tables go off, most of which were for brand-new\
  \ 1st-level characters created by participants new to the Society.</p> \n    <p>On\
  \ Friday night we ran an exclusive event called the Grand Melee, in which the Decemvirate\
  \ tested the participants to find the most skilled and most promising agents for\
  \ future endeavors. Over five continuous encounters, each tiered table was put up\
  \ against increasingly powerful foes, culminating in a combat rated at CR +4 for\
  \ the lowest tier and CR +5 for the higher tiers. In the end, the winning table\
  \ scored 173 points in Tier 1–2 (followed closely by a Tier 5–6 table with 164 points.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Not only did players compete with one another for special prizes in the\
  \ Grand Melee, but all of the event's GMs were battling to provide the hardest challenge\
  \ and the most enjoyable experience for their tables. In the end, the running was\
  \ close, but San Diego Venture-Captain Eric Brittain came out ahead. As a reward\
  \ for his GMing performance in the event, he will receive his next GM star for free,\
  \ bumping him from 2 to 3 in a single event.</p> \n    <p>Speaking of GM stars,\
  \ Hyrum and I were proud to see two active 4-star GMs earn their 5th stars during\
  \ the convention. Congratulations are in order for Kyle Baird and Missouri Venture-Captain\
  \ Jason Roeder. Welcome to the ranks of our most valued GMs, guys!</p> \n    <p>On\
  \ Saturday afternoon, Hyrum and I announced the five new factions, the names of\
  \ which were quickly tweeted and leaked onto the messageboards. We'll be covering\
  \ all five of these new player options in the coming weeks starting with the Grand\
  \ Lodge faction next week, so be sure to check the blog on Monday morning to see\
  \ more details than simply the basic premise and name of the first of our five new\
  \ factions.</p> \n    <p>Mark Moreland <br>Developer</p> \n   </blockquote> <!--\
