  \     </div> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">From low atmospheric\
  \ orbit, the crashed starship could have easily been mistaken for some great beast,\
  \ slain in the heat of battle. Its trajectory had cut a fiery and destructive swathe\
  \ through thick jungle, and here and there small bits of flame still licked at the\
  \ foliage, the steaming soil smoldering from the heat of the starship’s unexpected\
  \ collision, ending at its broken corpse. The hull had been nearly rent in two upon\
  \ impact, and shorn wiring, ducting, loose crates, and coolant spilled from within\
  \ like mechanical viscera.</p> \n      <p>As the day bled into twilight, from within\
  \ the darkness of the starship’s carcass, a life pod beeped rapidly. Kasa took a\
  \ pained gasp as she regained consciousness. She moved stiffly, feeling the distant\
  \ ache of what might have been a grievous injury. The life pod had flooded her system\
  \ with medical stabilizers, a failsafe to ensure functionality in the event of a\
  \ crash. As Kasa’s mental defenses churned into place, laced with the glittering\
  \ edge of the medical stimulant’s side-effects, she knew somehow that things couldn’\
  t possibly get much worse.</p> \n      <p>For a while, she lay in the coffin-snug\
  \ pod that had saved her life, her breath loud and metallic, her ears straining\
  \ to hear anything beyond from the stillness of her tight confinement. Wherever\
  \ the ship had made planetfall, she was likely safest in the life pod for the time\
  \ being. Kasa’s mind raced. Her eyes grew bleary with the threat of tears as panic\
  \ took hold in the illogical part of her brain. She blinked them away, taking a\
  \ deep breath and slowly counting objects within her view, a tool she adopted long\
  \ ago to help regain her composure when stressed. She was a scientist, first and\
  \ foremost, and that meant shedding fear of the unknown by making it known.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>With a grunt, Kasa found the panel along the wall near her thigh, fingertips\
  \ gliding over the interface to release the magnetic locks. The life pod’s lid slid\
  \ aside with a hiss, and she gingerly hauled herself over the lip and waited for\
  \ her vision to adjust to the darkness of the life support chamber. Blinking as\
  \ shapes came into sharper focus, the shadows slowly brightening to shades of illuminated\
  \ gray, Kasa made her way aft, stealing glances at the other life pods, all empty\
  \ or crushed, she noted with dismay.</p> \n      <p>As a scientist, she hadn’t been\
  \ needed on the bridge and thus had no idea where in the universe they—no, it was\
  \ only <em>she</em> who remained—could be. She knew, as the silence of isolation\
  \ stretched ever onward during her tentative search, that anybody who could answer\
  \ such a question had been killed in the impact. What magic or science could divine\
  \ her location and see to her rescue was lost for now. Perhaps even for good.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>It took her the better part of an hour to dig through the med-bay,\
  \ salvaging what stimulant packs she could find. The armory had survived the crash,\
  \ as had its door, which remained barred to her without proper authorization. Kasa\
  \ stared at the flickering interface, which flashed warnings and reported on various\
  \ system malfunctions that could be distilled into a single message: without brute\
  \ force or proper authorization overrides, she would find no weapons here.</p> \n\
  \      <p>That first night under alien stars, she was fitful and skittish. Several\
  \ times she nodded off, until fear exhausted her and she shut her eyes out of necessity.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Dawn came on suddenly, and Kasa was reminded that this world, its atmosphere,\
  \ its sun—or suns—were all variables in the new problem that unfolded before her.\
  \ She blinked wearily as her dry, exhausted eyes pricked in the alien air. With\
  \ a grunt, she unfurled herself from her crouch, stretching and shouldering her\
  \ pack. If the shuttle bay was intact, there was bound to be something working.\
  \ She rationalized that it had to be so; no circumstances could be so dire, after\
  \ all. Unfortunately, her path to the shuttle bay was too obstructed for her to\
  \ climb through, and she realized she would finally have to go outside and see if\
  \ another path presented itself. She backtracked but found that the only way out\
  \ would be up, through the ship’s now-open overhead. Beyond, she could only see\
  \ the forest canopy, still but for the occasional rustle of leaves, the cries of\
  \ unfamiliar fauna.</p> \n      <p>Grimly, Kasa began her ascent, using the ship’\
  s exposed wiring to haul herself up and onto the outer hull. It was a great effort,\
  \ and had any been there to witness her summit, they would have found her sprawled\
  \ across the sun-warmed hull, catching her breath before she finally sitting up\
  \ to look around.</p> \n      <p>All around her was dense, writhing jungle: trees\
  \ as tall as towers, with thick, obdurate vines crawling possessively around their\
  \ trunks and boasting vivid blossoms with pollen-rich stamen. Try as she might to\
  \ place the flora around her, nothing in the catalogue of her mind recalled even\
  \ the slightest comfort of familiarity. She shielded her eyes against the harsh\
  \ glare of the sunlight that beat through the treetops and discerned, just barely\
  \ visible through the overgrowth, a trail. It may have been abandoned, but a trail\
  \ meant this place was once inhabited, and that would suffice.</p> \n      <p>Fear\
  \ of the unknown gave way to Kasa’s inherent curiosity, and she picked a path along\
  \ the curve of the ship’s hull toward the shuttle bay. Much of the vessel had broken\
  \ apart in the crash, and she made short work of climbing down into the massive\
  \ bay. The collapsed half of the starboard bulkhead had taken all but one of the\
  \ three Explorer vehicles with it, but the remaining Explorer sat almost pristine,\
  \ save for a single crack along the window shielding. Kasa let herself smile at\
  \ the first good news she’d had since waking up.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  >Starfinder Galaxy Exploration Manual</a></p>\n      </div> \n      <p>Kasa ripped\
  \ through the jungle in the Explorer for hours, following the ancient overgrown\
  \ path. She took her time, checking for signs of intelligent life, and for a while\
  \ she thought all she would find would be jungle. But then the path opened into\
  \ a wider avenue; not quite paved, but clearly marked by the deliberate imprint\
  \ of civilization. She brought the Explorer to a halt, peering through the windows\
  \ to see jungle give way to more deliberate architecture. This ruin, though empty\
  \ of all life, was the surest sign of someone having lived here. Kasa popped the\
  \ hatch and climbed out of the vehicle to have a look around.</p> \n      <p>Whatever\
  \ else this was, it was a discovery—one that none but the forgotten ghosts of those\
  \ who once called this place home would bear witness. Kasa lamented not being able\
  \ to salvage her research equipment as she stood in the clearing, taking in the\
  \ moss-draped, domed towers like ancient mushrooms and arched doorways that stood\
  \ like portals to another world, waiting to be opened. Though the ruin had collapsed\
  \ around them, surrendering to the jungle, these remained, all seemingly built for\
  \ beings much larger than she.</p> \n      <p>“Giants?” She wondered incredulously,\
  \ her first word in hours, voice dry and reedy from disuse. She turned a slow circuit,\
  \ once again frowning at her inability to recognize any of the architecture, its\
  \ design at once ancient but still entirely too alien for her to get even an echo\
  \ of familiarity from it. Something about the jungle here was quieter, as if the\
  \ order once imposed upon it still lingered, beating back all save the hapless moss\
  \ that crawled along the ancient stone. She soon saw why.</p> \n      <p>The thing—\
  the <em>monolith</em>—was massive, jutting from the ground like a spear, and indeed\
  \ was so anachronistic in comparison to its surroundings that Kasa wondered how\
  \ it wasn’t the first thing she noticed. It was metal of some kind, she could tell\
  \ from first glance, emanating soft blue light from the markings along its surface.\
  \ Unlike the rest of the structures, it didn’t seem to warp to the ruinous touch\
  \ of time, and the vines of the jungle barely forayed onto its massive base, as\
  \ if the jungle itself were hesitant to claim the invasive structure. Kasa craned\
  \ her neck to peer upward. Its length seemed to vanish beyond the forest canopy,\
  \ bathing her in its light.</p> \n      <p>Tentatively, she raised a hand, reaching\
  \ out toward it. Perhaps it was an interface, albeit an ancient one. There could\
  \ be no harm in a simple touch.</p> \n      <p>There was a sudden rustle, and bursting\
  \ from the copse of trees beyond the ruin came several avian-simian creatures, taking\
  \ wing in unison. Fleeing.</p> \n      <p>Kasa took one more glance at the monolith,\
  \ rummaging in her pack for a datapad she’d salvaged from the wreckage. The device\
  \ flashed cheerful yellow warnings that there was no communications node available\
  \ for outside access, but she could still use the local capabilities. She did her\
  \ best to scan and document the relic before her, sweat prickling the nape of her\
  \ neck as she began to realize that she was no longer alone in the ruins, and that\
  \ whoever—or whatever—had sent the creatures into startled flight would be upon\
  \ her soon.</p> \n      <p>She turned, backing up to the monolith, the security\
  \ of its solidity offering her the only comfort and protection she could find in\
  \ this alien world. With her head against it, she could hear it thrumming—a faint,\
  \ rhythmic buzzing that seemed to come from deep underground, wherever the spire’\
  s roots held it firm to the jungle floor. Beyond that sound, Kasa heard and saw\
  \ nothing. The alien creatures had fled, leaving her alone with the monolith.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>As suddenly as lightning, the thrumming stopped, and in its place—\
  in her mind—Kasa heard, <em>felt</em>, a high-pitched shriek. There were words in\
  \ the cry, or the feeling, the meaning, behind words.</p> \n      <p>“<em>Help us</em>,”\
  \ they pled. “<em>Help us, Kasa! Free us…before it returns</em>.”</p> \n     </blockquote>\
