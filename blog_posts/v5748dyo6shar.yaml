  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">“COLLISION IN THIRTY SEC...”\
  \ Keskodai punched a flashing button and the ship computer fell silent, but the\
  \ cockpit was still roaring from re-entry. From behind, he heard the shrieking of\
  \ metal as the ship’s rear quarter twisted into collapsing fragments. </p> \n  \
  \   <p><em>If I can just get the nose up. Iseph would know what to do.</em> He was\
  \ pathing now, as the only other living occupant of the Hellknight ship shared his\
  \ telepathy</p> \n     <p>Raia dropped into the co-pilot seat next to him and began\
  \ to struggle with the controls. <em>Surely, this vessel must have an aerobraking\
  \ system for safe landing in an emergency?</em></p> \n     <p><em>And I’d gladly\
  \ use it, but all the controls are in devilspeak</em>! Keskodai waved a hand over\
  \ a control panel covered in infernal symbols.</p> \n     <p>Raia didn’t take her\
  \ eyes off the viewscreen before her.<em> Perhaps we should not have killed the\
  \ entire crew</em>.</p> \n     <p><em>They went to a Hell of their own making</em>.\
  \ Keskodai stared helplessly at the controls. <em>I’m just not ready to join them\
  \ yet</em>.</p> \n     <p>Their thoughts fell silent as the surface of the planet\
  \ rumbled ever closer. The shaking front viewscreen went yellow, then red, before\
  \ their eyes; re-entry was melting the ship. Beneath them, however, were endless\
  \ fields of white, a thick blanket of snow that rolled gently over hills and down\
  \ into deep drifts.</p> \n     <p><em>It must be one of those</em>, Raia pathed,\
  \ pointing to a set of six brilliantly flashing buttons on Keskodai’s side of the\
  \ cockpit. </p> \n     <p><em>But ... which?</em> He took a hand off the control\
  \ wheel and hovered over the array of buttons. Each bore indecipherable symbols.\
  \ He felt himself overwhelmed by the consequence of choice. How many chances would\
  \ he have to activate the proper system? If he picked the wrong one, would his choice\
  \ doom the vessel, himself, and Raia? Or could he try again? Was there some clue\
  \ here in the cockpit, written in letters that were twisted like fire but rigid\
  \ like prison bars, that would help him select the proper one? It was thrilling,\
  \ this paralysis. And every moment of indecision made the consequences vastly greater.\
  \ His antenna twitched and shivered in horrified delight.</p> \n     <p>Raia’s eyes\
  \ were wide with fear. They were less than a mile above the ground now, little more\
  \ than a meteor adorned with half-melted spikes. <em>Just pick one!</em></p> \n\
  \     <p>But he could not move</p> \n     <p>At the last instant, she lunged across\
  \ the cockpit for the controls. Keskodai felt the braking thrusters fire, and they\
  \ were both hurled from their chairs towards the viewscreen.</p> \n     <p>Then\
  \ came blackness. And silence.</p> \n     <p>Raia awoke first. Everything was tilted\
  \ at an angle. Crumpled in the cockpit’s nose, she tried to move. Pain. Broken shoulder.\
  \ Her last healing serum... in her belt. Thinking was hard. But as the fluid trickled\
  \ down her throat her head cleared. She was alive.</p> \n     <p>Keskodai lay on\
  \ the floor, in bad shape. His chitin was cracked. She didn’t understand his biology\
  \ but it wasn’t good. There was a box on the wall with a red vial on its face; she\
  \ didn’t need to read the Hellknights’ devil language to recognize it as a first\
  \ aid kit. Inside, a dermal stapler. The device made a ka-lunk sound as she put\
  \ Keskodai’s abdominal plates back together. She bit the cap off a tube of sprayflesh\
  \ and squeezed it out over the wound. It was all she could do.</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ cold wasn’t from her injuries. Hull plates had separated in the descent, and a\
  \ frigid wind outside blew snow sideways. She thumbed her environmental protections\
  \ and leapt out one of the holes, landing in a knee-high drift.</p> \n     <div\

  \     </div> \n     <p>The crash had attracted scavengers. Half a dozen, each big\
  \ as a shotalashu, with whip-like tails and massive lower jaws ending in projecting\
  \ tusks. “Calories must be exceptionally difficult to find in this biome,” she said,\
  \ not expecting them to respond. “So your hunger is understandable, but you will\
  \ find me more trouble than I’m worth.” Behind her, she heard Keskodai climbing\
  \ from the wreck.</p> \n     <p>Before the first one could lunge for her, she hurled\
  \ twin bolts of green force at it, and pieces of the creature flew away into the\
  \ freezing air, digitized into binary code. That surprised it, but the others charged.\
  \ Bringing her hands together, touching thumbs, she conjured a fan of emerald flame\
  \ and backed towards the ship. A white light spiraled out from over her shoulder:\
  \ Keskodai. His psychic blast overwhelmed one of the creatures; it fell writhing\
  \ in the snow, but the others were close now. She tried to levitate; one of the\
  \ creatures clamped down on her leg with its massive jaws and she cried out as pain\
  \ overwhelmed her. Desperate, she found her baton. It wouldn’t be enough.</p> \n\
  \     <p>But the frenzy abated. One of the animals sniffed the air, and the pack\
  \ made snuffling noises to each other. As Raia slowly slid down the side of the\
  \ hull into the snow, the beasts loped off.</p> \n     <p>Keskodai lowered himself\
  \ down and got an arm under Raia. <em>They can smell the Hellknight corpses</em>,\
  \ he told her. <em>Let’s hope they enjoy barbecue</em>.</p> \n     <p><em>We only\
  \ have a little time. If we have not found shelter by the time they come back...</em>\
  \ she winced as she tried to put weight on her leg.</p> \n     <p>Keskodai helped\
  \ her to her feet, and they limped to the top of a nearby hill. There wasn’t much\
  \ to see, but a river of unnaturally dark blue was barely visible in the distance.\
  \ They made for it.</p> \n     <p>The going was painful and slow. The snow stopped\
  \ falling, but it was still thick and the ground was impossible to see, until suddenly\
  \ only Keskodai’s long antennae were visible, the rest of him having fallen into\
  \ a deep drift. It was growing dark as they reached the river. Raia knelt down to\
  \ cup the water. “Antifreeze,” she said. It was the first they’d spoken since the\
  \ attack. They couldn’t drink this.</p> \n     <p>“You’re mad at me.” Keskodai indicated\
  \ no emotion, simply stating a fact.</p> \n     <p>“You shirren and your damn ...\
  \ choice paralysis!”</p> \n     <p>“I am sorry, Raia.”</p> \n     <p>“My history\
  \ teacher, Ms. Lueda, had a saying. ‘It is best to do the right thing. Next best\
  \ is to do something. Worst of all is to do nothing.’”</p> \n     <p>“I said I was\
  \ sorry.”</p> \n     <p>“Don’t they teach you anything in school?”</p> \n     <p>“\
  I did not go to school.”</p> \n     <p>That made her pause. She couldn’t imagine\
  \ it. “What?”</p> \n     <p>“My parents carried me with them, day after day. I learned\
  \ about life through their experiences. Just as I carry Chk Chk.” He patted the\
  \ armored cradle jar at his hip.</p> \n     <p>“Wait, you brought your son <em>here</em>?\
  \ Through all,” she gestured in the vague direction of the crash and nearly stumbled.\
  \ “That?”</p> \n     <p>“How else is he to learn?”</p> \n     <p>Raia’s leg was\
  \ numb with pain. She was cold, but her environmental protections were running fine.\
  \ That meant it wasn’t the weather. Shock was getting to her. She couldn’t stand\
  \ any longer. Lowering herself to the river bank, she lay back in the snow.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Keskodai knelt down beside her.</p> \n     <p>Still angry, she pulled\
  \ away from him ever so slightly. “What are you doing?”</p> \n     <p>“Healing your\
  \ injuries.”</p> \n     <p>“You’re empty. We used almost everything we had on the\
  \ Hellknights, and the rest on those scavengers.” </p> \n     <p>Was that a smile?\
  \ Raia couldn’t tell. “See, this is where your magic and mine differ,” he said,\
  \ placing a hand on her head. It wasn’t the leg that was killing her, he knew. It\
  \ was head trauma from the crash. “So long as I’m alive, I’m never empty.”</p> \n\
  \     <p>Her head began to clear. But as it did, Keskodai’s green head gained ugly\
  \ yellow bruises. Her leg stopped hurting, but cracks appeared in his chitin. One\
  \ of his antennae withered. She lurched up, grabbing him, and emphatically pathed,\
  \ Stop! He stopped.</p> \n     <p>“You didn’t have to do that, you ridiculous...”\
  \ She was speaking again. “Why did you do that?”</p> \n     <p>Now it was Keskodai’\
  s turn to fall flat on his back in the snow. She didn’t know how much damage he\
  \ had done to himself, but it was serious. Maybe fatal. “It was easy,” he said.\
  \ “There was only one choice.”</p> \n     <p>Raia still had the dermal stapler.\
  \ She dug it out, gave it a quick whack to break the ice that had formed around\
  \ the dispenser, and started <em>ka-lunking</em> the shirren back together. He began\
  \ to make a noise, a rapid hk-ik-ikking noise.</p> \n     <p>“Are you laughing?\
  \ Because from my perspective none of this is particularly funny.”</p> \n     <p>But\
  \ he only rose a hand toward the sky. She looked over one shoulder. </p> \n    \
  \ <p>The Sunrise Maiden emerged from the clouds. For the first time in days, Raia\
  \ smiled.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p style=\"font-weight: bold; line-height:\
