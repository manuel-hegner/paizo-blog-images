  \    </div> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">It's time to get spooky! Those Order\
  \ of the Amber Die folks delivered their report from the third chapter of <i>Doomsday\
  \ Dawn</i>, and now y'all can read about how it went for them (and see the pretty\
  \ pictures they took of their experience. If you intend of playing through this\
  \ adventure, maybe wait to read this blog after you're done so that you don't run\
  \ into any spoilers!</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>After our initial experiences\
  \ in <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo670md?Order-of-the-Amber-DieDoomsday-Dawn-Playtest\"\
  >Part One</a> and <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo6sg9p?Order-of-the-Amber-DieDoomsday-Dawn-Playtest\"\
  >Part Two</a> of the playtest, it was time for part three and our first adventure\
  \ by author Amanda Hamon Kunz. To set the atmosphere for the land of gothic horror,\
  \ our GM decided to render the old mansion on vinyl and bring it to life with some\
  \ custom pieces from <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/geordiejohnstudios/\">Geordie\
  \ John Studios</a>. Having full access to the mansion in 3-D allowed us to better\
  \ appreciate, explore, and eventually defend it. Then we surrounded our play area\
  \ with candles, put on some dark music, and ventured out toward Sombrefell Hall\
  \ on the shores of Lantern Lake.</p> \n     <h2>The Party</h2> \n     <p>In much\
  \ the way part two had certain guidelines for character creation, part three had\
  \ its own interesting challenge regarding party construction: a group in which every\
  \ member had access to healing. With that before us, we tried to make heroes that\
  \ fit into both the setting of Ustalav and conformed to the guidelines for part\
  \ three, while still allowing ourselves the opportunity for some character customization.\
  \ To add some mood to our interactions with each other, our GM decided that while\
  \ our characters all had ties to the Esoteric Order of the Palatine Eye, they didn't\
  \ necessarily know each other very well. Exploring an old mansion by candlelight\
  \ when we weren't completely secure with each other added tension, but we clicked\
  \ well enough when combat broke out.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-title\"><b>Casia\

  \     <h2>Highlights From Affair at Sombrefell Hall</h2> \n     <p>The narrative\
  \ structure of this part was entirely different from the first two. After the all-too-quiet\
  \ build up we experienced while exploring the mansion, things exploded into frantic\
  \ wave-by-wave action against undead. We rushed to build barricades along the mansion's\
  \ key entry points, and things started to feel like the best mashup of both Pathfinder\
  \ and Call of Duty: Zombies. Props to the author here, as tactical awareness was\
  \ just as valuable as the dozen channels our clerics fired off.</p> \n     <p>Our\
  \ first paladin of the playtest had a great showing, and it's hard to select a single\
  \ highlight out of her many: kill-stealing a wave of ghasts from the party, landing\
  \ a couple of clutch retributive strikes, and standing toe-to-pincer with a brain\
  \ collector at the end.</p> \n     <p>After several intense game hours of holding\
  \ back undead, resources were starting to run low and our potential for error grew.\
  \ Dan is laughing about a second stat like this, but a surprise appearance by an\
  \ aberration leading the undead resulted in another <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkyn?Order-of-the-Amber-DieThe-Azlant-Odyssey-Part-4\"\
  >\"own goal\" on his record</a>. Granted, he missed the identification roll, but\
  \ Tinryl healed it nonetheless when trying to channel it down. The ungrateful brain\
  \ collector returned the favor by dishing out two critical hits to the cleric in\
  \ the same round: 105 damage.</p> \n     <h2>Character Deaths</h2> \n     <p>None.\
  \ While we can chalk this up to the massive amount of healing power this party was\
  \ packing, it can't go without mention that we played a tight game when it came\
  \ to barricade placement.</p> \n     <h2>Current Situation</h2> \n     <p>What was\
  \ supposed to be an information-gathering mission to contact a professor on sabbatical,\
  \ became a five-hour scrap against a variety of undead and one of our best performances\
  \ in recent years. We did lose an NPC, a research assistant who hid well enough\
  \ in a bedroom--which happened to become a battleground. As we build characters\
  \ for part four, despite this being a playtest we're too competitive with ourselves\
  \ not to tally up our record: 2-1.</p> \n     <p>Follow Order of the Amber Die on\
