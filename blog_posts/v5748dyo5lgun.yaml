  articleBody\"> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">The inaugural season of the Pathfinder\
  \ Society Adventure Card Guild is underway, and players across the globe are testing\
  \ their mettle against not-so-lone sharks and a very frisky dragon turtle. Curious\
  \ about the story so far? You’ve come to the right place!</p> \n     <p>Before I\
  \ get to that, though, you should be aware that weekly scenario downloads will resume\
  \ in January, as the goblins in the Paizo workshop take a much-needed holiday.</p>\
  \ \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <strong>Beware, me hearties—story spoilers\
  \ for Adventure #1 of <a href=\"/pfsacg/products/season0\">Season of the Shackles</a>\
  \ lurk below.</strong>\n     </div> \n     <p>Adventure 1 begins with normal, friendly,\
  \ totally not-a-pirate you, innocently hiring passage on a Shackles ship for what\
  \ you thought was a, well, perhaps not a three<em>-hour</em> tour, but a nice safe\
  \ voyage from island to island. The ship’s navigator, one Jemma Redclaw, had other\
  \ plans.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb120\">\n      <a href=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/141223-JemmaRedclaw.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static4.paizo.com//image/content/Blog/141223-JemmaRedclaw_120.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n      <br>She seemed friendly. No hint of dastard to be seen.\n     </div>\
  \ \n     <p>Your first night aboard, as you slept the sleep of the naive, Redclaw\
  \ and her hand-picked band of sailors mutinied. You woke up on a pirate ship as\
  \ esteemed guests. Guests who were forced to participate in a seemingly endless\
  \ series of near-fatal encounters with sharks, a brine dragon, a disgusting undead\
  \ former captain, sharks, every angry animal on this side of the world, a lady who\
  \ seemed to be one-third octopus, one-third seacat, and one-third humanoid. You’\
  ll be having nightmares about that last one for a while.</p> \n     <p>After dispensing\
  \ with Captain Redclaw and her scurrilous band, you realized that a pirate’s life\
  \ can be a good one. You’ve got your own ship, your own crew (who seem to understand\
  \ the laws of personal hygiene in a way that Redclaw’s mates, unfortunately, did\
  \ not), and your eye on the horizon.</p> \n     <p>Next week, we’ll talk about Love\
  \ Plots and the naming of scenarios.</p> \n     <p>Before we go, though, a note\
  \ from Vic Wertz about <a href=\"/products/btpy96yw\"><em>Skull &amp; Shackles Adventure\
  \ Deck 4</em></a>: </p>\n     <blockquote> \n      <p>Due to a printer error, adventure\
  \ deck 4 of Skull &amp; Shackles, <a href=\"/products/btpy96yw\"><em>Island of Empty\
  \ Eyes</em></a>, included 6 copies of the henchman Gholdako and 1 copy of the henchman\
  \ Ghol-Gan Obelisk; it should have had 6 Ghol-Gan Obelisks and 1 Gholdako. And due\
  \ to our own error, it has 1 fewer Blink Spider than you’ll need when you have 6\
  \ players.</p> \n      <p>We’re going to solve this problem by making a pack of\
  \ cards that includes 5 Ghol-Gan Obelisks, 1 Blink Spider, and—in the interest of\
  \ turning lemons into lemonade—The Land of the Blind, a brand-new scenario that\
  \ makes use of those extra Gholdako cards. &nbsp;We’ll be providing that for free\
  \ to customers who purchased Island of Empty Eyes from paizo.com, and we’ll also\
  \ be sending copies through our distributors as well. With luck, we’ll have them\
  \ in time to send them out along with January’s release of Adventure Deck 5, <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy97lv\"><em>The Price of Infamy</em></a>.</p> \n      <p>In\
  \ the meantime, when you play the scenario \"Home Sweet Home,\" we suggest proxying\
  \ with Buccaneers (that is, setting the Ghol-Gan Obelisk to the side, adding Buccaneers\
  \ to the location decks instead, and referring to the Obelisk whenever you find\
  \ a Buccaneer).</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>Tanis O'Connor<br> <em>Adventure\
