  /store/v5748btpy7zdj\"><i>Crucible of Chaos</i></a> has been sent to the printer\
  \ and is due to come out next month. This module features a number of really cool\
  \ locations, including a crashed sky city. To get you salivating for this dangerous\
  \ adventure, here is a look at the final cover and the info from the back of the\
  \ module.\n   <p></p> \n   <blockquote> \n    <h2>Uncover the ruins of the flying\
  \ city</h2> \n    <p>Legends speak of an ancient culture that drifted through the\
  \ clouds atop immense floating cities. These same tales speak of a horrible catastrophe\
  \ that brought them low, but no one has discovered the true cause. Now, a mystical\
  \ compass has been discovered that seems to point to an unexplored valley, one that\
  \ just might hold the secrets of this lost empire. But will the same catastrophe\
  \ strike again?</p> \n    <p><i>Crucible of Chaos</i> is a journey-based adventure\
  \ for 8th-level characters compatible with the world's most popular fantasy roleplaying\
  \ game. This adventure contains details on the valley containing the crashed sky-city,\
  \ including the natives who live there, as well as information on those who brought\
  \ about the city's downfall.</p> \n    <p>This adventure is set in the unexplored\
  \ reaches of the Realm of the Mammoth Lords, one of the nations in the <i>Pathfinder\
  \ Chronicles</i> Campaign Setting, but it can be easily adapted for use in any setting.\
