  \ 2014</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p>After a relaxing vacation\
  \ last week, I'm back in force with a look at SIX upcoming figures for the Pathfinder\
  \ Battles line of prepainted plastic minis!</p> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\"\
  >This time we're going to take a look at the digital sculpts for Iconic Heroes Two,\
  \ which is set for a February 2015 release. The set will contain five of Pathfinder's\
  \ iconic characters, plus one associated creature. This is the second of several\
  \ such sets to release monthly starting in January. Check out the <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lgds\"\
  >preview of Iconic Heroes Set One</a> I posted a few weeks back for a look at the\
  \ first six figures. Iconic Heroes sets are \"visible\" sets, meaning you'll know\
  \ exactly what figures are in each \"fixed\" set. They retail for $29.99. WizKids\
  \ is making every effort to ensure that the figures receive \"premium\" sculpts\
  \ and paint jobs.</span></p> \n    <p>As part of that process, they've shifted the\
  \ Pathfinder Battles line to digital sculpts, which allows us here at Paizo a much\
  \ higher degree of control over the way the miniatures look and the colors used\
  \ to paint them. This is especially important with our iconic characters, all of\
  \ whom have key pieces of important equipment that must be reproduced in exacting\
  \ detail. While digital sculpts can look really cool, it's also impossible to show\
  \ all of the drybrushing and inking effects that the final figures will have, so\
  \ it's best to imagine that the final figures will share all of the details and\
  \ the general color scheme, but will look more \"finished\" and less \"clean\" than\
  \ the images provided below. We'll share paint masters as we get them from WizKids\
  \ (a process that is set to begin very shortly, so the wait may not be a long one!).</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Here we go!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20140912-Amiri.jpg\"\
  > <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20140912-Amiri_180.jpeg\"></a>\n \
  \   </div> \n    <p>Here we have Amiri, Iconic Barbarian. Amiri comes complete with\
  \ a nasty snarl and her huge frost giant sword positioned mid-swing. This version\
  \ of our iconic barbarian is in much more of a battle pose than the previous version\
  \ from <a href=\"/products/btpy8v0b\"><i>Shattered Star</i></a>, and I think people\
  \ are really going to dig her. The digital sculpting process has given us a lot\
  \ of good opportunity to make sure her face tattoo and belly scars look just right,\
  \ and I expect those details will carry through beautifully to the final figure.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20140912-Ezren.jpg\"\
  > <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20140912-Ezren_180.jpeg\"></a>\n \
  \   </div> \n    <p>Ezren, Iconic Wizard has fast become one of my favorite iconic\
  \ characters thanks to his excellent portrayal in both Dynamite's <a href=\"/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics\"\
  >Pathfinder Comics</a> and Big Finish's <a href=\"/pathfinder/legends\">Pathfinder\
  \ Legends</a> audio dramas. Here we see his cane raised mid-spell, and again the\
  \ digital sculpting has allowed us to meticulously reproduce all of the magical\
  \ implements hanging from his belt. Ezren has a really \"classic\" look to him that\
  \ makes this figure a great stand-in for any spellcaster or even any \"old man\"\
  \ adventurer.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20140912-Merisiel.jpg\"\
  > <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20140912-Merisiel_180.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>Another favorite from the comics and audio dramas is Merisiel,\
  \ Iconic Rogue. Our newest version of this fun character appears in charging-forward\
  \ battle pose, rapier high on the attack. All of her many daggers are represented\
  \ in sheaths on her back and hips. This is definitely a character you don't want\
  \ to run into in a dark alley, or an ally you definitely want to be flanking a monster\
  \ with.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20140912-Kyra.jpg\"\
  > <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20140912-Kyra_180.jpeg\"></a>\n  \
  \  </div> \n    <p>Kyra, Iconic Cleric was one of the very first Pathfinder Battles\
  \ figures we ever produced, and the quality of her cloak in particular set the high\
  \ standards we've been trying to match or exceed ever since. That figure, one of\
  \ four in our very first <a href=\"/products/btpy8l52\"><i>Beginner Box Heroes</i></a>\
  \ set, was wonderful. We hope to one-up it with this figure. I mean, we even made\
  \ sure the little tattoos under her eyes look correct! The pose in this case is\
  \ quite similar to the original figure, so it'll be interesting to compare how the\
  \ two came out (that pun, I assure you, was unintentional!).</p> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20140912-Harsk.jpg\">\
  \ <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20140912-Harsk_180.jpeg\"></a>\n \
  \   </div> \n    <p>Have you heard the <a href=\"/pathfinder/legends\">Pathfinder\
  \ Legends</a> audio dramas? One of the very best renditions of our characters in\
  \ that medium is Harsk, Iconic Ranger, my personal favorite dwarf in all of Pathfinder\
  \ lore. The Iconic Heroes Two version of Harsk favors his axe over his crossbow,\
  \ making this a nice change from the version we previously released in the <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8rqs\"><i>Rise of the Runelords</i></a> set. He's even got his signature\
  \ teapot along with his other gear on his back. Sweet!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  > <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20140912-Biter.jpg\"> <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20140912-Biter_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Did you know that Harsk's little-seen animal companion\
  \ is a badger named Biter? This Small figure marks Biter's first appearance in Pathfinder\
  \ Battles. You can use Biter along with Harsk or as an animal companion of another\
  \ character. He'll make a nice addition to the horde of animals (pigs, goats, ravens,\
  \ falcons, owls, and more!) that we've included in the line so far. Just don't let\
  \ him get too close to you when he's angry. He got his name for a reason!</p> \n\
  \    <p>Each set of Pathfinder Battles Iconic Heroes comes with a special <a href=\"\
  /pathfinder/adventureCardGame\">Pathfinder Adventure Card Game</a> card available\
  \ exclusively in these boxes. I've seen several of these cards already, and they're\
  \ designed to add fun, cool elements to the card game that players are sure to appreciate.\
  \ I mean, who wouldn't want a card for Harsk's Teapot?</p> \n    <p>That's it for\
  \ this week. Check back next week for another look at new minis from November's\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy96kb\"><i>The Lost Coast</i></a> set! WizKids brought\
  \ in the complete set of production run figures last week, and they look absolutely\
  \ fantastic!</p> \n    <p>See you in seven days!</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p>\
