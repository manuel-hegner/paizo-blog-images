  \ of Goblins</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Thursday, March 27, 2014</p> \n    <div\
  \ itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n     <p><span itemprop=\"description\">When I was\
  \ writing \"Burnt Offerings,\" I was focused mostly on the daunting task of setting\
  \ up an adventure that would not only present goblins as monsters you love to hate,\
  \ but also to launch an entire new product line. I was focused on how to make the\
  \ adventure simultaneously introduce the world to a new world while at the same\
  \ time feeling old-school enough that it felt nostalgic and familiar and comfortable.\
  \ I wanted readers of the first Adventure Path installment to enjoy the innovations,\
  \ but to feel more than ever that this was the same game they've enjoyed playing\
  \ for years.</span></p> \n     <p>I think it's fair to say that I never really stopped\
  \ to think what the characters sounded like, or how a 50 page adventure could translate\
  \ into an hour long audio drama.</p> \n     <p>When we sealed the deal with Big\
  \ Finish to produce <a href=\"/products/btpy91vs\">Rise of the Runelords as a full\
  \ cast audio adventure</a>, though, those were among the many questions we had to\
  \ answer. We worked closely with Big Finish from the start on both determining what\
  \ iconics should be featured in the story and what parts of the adventure needed\
  \ to be represented in the hour-long running time for each installment.</p> \n \
  \    <p>Choosing the characters, in retrospect, was relatively easy. The important\
  \ NPCs would be determined by what parts of the adventure we chose to adapt, so\
  \ it came down to the PCs as the main choices we had to make early on—we knew we\
  \ wanted four adventurers, since that's the basic assumption we make for the game...\
  \ but which four? In the end, we knew that just as the visuals of all our iconics\
  \ are so distinctive, we needed the voices to be distinctive as well. The first-time\
  \ listener needed to be able to tell the four heroes apart just by listening to\
  \ their voices. Furthermore, we wanted to choose the four iconic heroes from those\
  \ who were actually featured on the covers of Rise of the Runelords. Harsk and Ezren\
  \ made a lot of sense, because their voices—an old man's and a gruff dwarf's—were\
  \ so distinctive. Valeros was an obvious choice since he was the first iconic we'd\
  \ illustrated he's as close as we have to a \"main character\" among all the iconics.\
  \ And that was it for the initial party—but we needed one more. I pushed hard for\
  \ Merisiel, and not only because she's my favorite iconic—she's also an elf AND\
  \ a female character, two elements that were missing from the current lineup.</p>\

  \ without a dedicated healer in the group... but fortunately, when you get to control\
  \ all aspects of the story and don't have to worry about dice and chance throwing\
  \ curve balls at you, you can write the story so that the lack of a healer isn't\
  \ an issue.</p> \n     <p>And that brings us to the second part of the question—\
  how do you condense an adventure that can provide for hours and hours of game play\
  \ over the course of several days of gaming sessions into a single hour?</p> \n\
  \     <p>And it's here that Big Finish's writers stepped up big time. For each installment,\
  \ the authors write out a brief outline of what elements they want to focus on,\
  \ and then we at Paizo would go over the outlines and approve some elements and\
  \ make suggestions for others. Deciding what parts of the adventure are important\
  \ to cover and what parts are not made for some tough choices—the reduction of Nualia's\
  \ henchmen in number or the entire catacombs of wrath would have been great to hear,\
  \ but the storyline works without them as well. Once we approve the outline, then\
  \ the next step is for us to approve the full script—we'd go through page by page,\
  \ giving feedback from \"Harsk is spitting too much\" to \"Ameiko wouldn't say that,\"\
  \ and much more... and once that stage was done, the task of actually recording\
  \ the dialogue came next.</p> \n     <table class=\"table-spacing-large\" style=\"\
