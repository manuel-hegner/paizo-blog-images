  \  <p class=\"date\">Saturday, December 19, 2015</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"\
  > \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">The caravan pulled into the campsite. Suso watched\
  \ from the safety of the wagon while the adults made camp and tended to the animals.\
  \ The mild winter meant an extended traveling season, but tonight their wandering\
  \ paused long enough to celebrate the Ritual of Stardust. While most of their celebrations\
  \ of Desna arose spontaneously, the longest night and the longest day each year\
  \ held special reverence and rituals for the caravan's patron goddess. The company\
  \ had stopped two days early to give enough time to prepare for the special night.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Suso followed her grandmother throughout the preparations, asking questions\
  \ even though she already knew the answers. \"Grandmama, why do we add raisins to\
  \ the dough?\"</p> \n    <p>\"The raisins represent the stars in the sky.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"So why do we braid the dough?\"</p> \n    <p>\"The braid symbolizes\
  \ our winding path through this life, Suso.\"</p> \n    <p>Even though it broke\
  \ the rules of her game, Suso couldn't resist showing off a little. \"And you're\
  \ making a butterfly shape out of the dough to honor Desna!\"</p> \n    <p>\"Yes,\
  \ dear, you're correct.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Does that mean I can have one now?\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Her grandmother smiled. \"Nice try, Suso. They're for tomorrow.\" She\
  \ dumped a small mountain of raisins into the girl's outstretched palm, then shooed\
  \ her toward the door. \"These will have to hold you over. Now get!\"</p> \n   \
  \ <p style=\"text-align: center;\">∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n    <p>When dressing for the party,\
  \ the company pulled out its finest outfits, each of brightly colored flowing materials,\
  \ allowing free movement of limbs. Suso looked in her basket and chose a skirt dyed\
  \ in bright blue tones, a vest covered with mirrored discs, and a scarf with tassels\
  \ to tie about her waist. She swirled and twirled in front of her grandmother. \"\
  Grandmama, how do I look? Like a butterfly?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Very nice, Suso. But\
  \ it's still missing something.\" Her grandmother reached into the pouch at her\
  \ waist—the bag that held so many interesting things—and withdrew a rose quartz\
  \ crystal suspended from a thong. She placed it around Suso's neck. \"I think you're\
  \ old enough for a proper necklace, don't you?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Thank you, Grandmama!\
  \ Thank you!\" Suso hugged her grandmother tightly. Face pressed to the old woman's\
  \ stomach, she asked, \"Can I have a starknife too?\"</p> \n    <p>Her grandmother\
  \ laughed, making her stomach bounce. \"Not yet, little one. That must wait for\
  \ another season and another celebration.\"</p> \n    <p style=\"text-align: center;\"\
  >∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n    <p>As the sun set in the sky, the chosen members lit the bonfires\
  \ they had prepared. Five fires, set on the points of a star, ringed a large open\
  \ space. Those picked to light the fires took their places. Chosen from all walks\
  \ of life, they included the company's matriarch, the map-keeper, the lead hunter,\
  \ the newest baby with his parents, and a visitor from Brevoy who'd been traveling\
  \ with the company the past few months. They took lit brands and flung them into\
  \ the waiting stacks of wood. The flames crackled as the final fingers of light\
  \ retreated from the sky.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderCampaignSetting/PZO9267-DesnaShrine.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Suso shivered with excitement. Platters laden with meats,\
  \ roasted vegetables, and the special butterfly buns passed from hand to hand. Some\
  \ nights, there might not be enough food, but tonight the entire company would eat\
  \ its fill.</p> \n    <p>Throughout the feast, people rose in turn to sing, lifting\
  \ their voices to the stars. Some sang songs in homage to Desna, telling of her\
  \ association with the swallowtail butterfly, or citing passages from her holy text,\
  \ The Eight Scrolls. Others told of their travels, painting pictures of hard-to-reach\
  \ places and distant skies. A few sang of lucky encounters, in which Desna blessed\
  \ their endeavors. As the piles of food dwindled, people grabbed instruments and\
  \ accompanied the singers. Suso reached for a drum and pounded a beat, sometimes\
  \ in time with the song and sometimes counterpoint, whichever struck her fancy.\
  \ Members of the company started dancing, the firelight reflecting off the bangles\
  \ of their outfits as they spun and twirled.</p> \n    <p>Several hours of merriment\
  \ passed, the enthusiasm of the early hours ebbing to relaxation. Children curled\
  \ up in their parents' arms, exhausted from excitement and the late hour. Determined\
  \ to remain awake until the end, Suso rose to her feet and started a slow path around\
  \ the fires. As always, her grandmother tracked her passage with her eyes, watching\
  \ to make sure Suso didn't tumble into the flames.</p> \n    <p>Some time later,\
  \ Suso skipped back to her grandmother's side, holding a butterfly roll in her little\
  \ hands. She held out the desert. \"Share with me, Grandmama.\"</p> \n    <p>Her\
  \ grandmother reached out and broke off a small portion, \"Thank you, my dear.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>They looked toward the matriarch, who retrieved a pouch from behind\
  \ her seat and pulled herself to her feet. As the pouch passed from hand to hand,\
  \ each person removed a small handful of sand from its depths. As one, the company\
  \ turned to face the fires, a solid circle ringed by the star. Suso quickly popped\
  \ the last of her roll into her mouth and chewed as she scooped sand from the pouch.\
  \ Then she took her place between her grandmother and uncle.</p> \n    <p>As the\
  \ matriarch lifted her voice in invocation, the company threw the sand onto the\
  \ embers. The sand shimmered as it flew through the air, drifting down upon the\
  \ coals.</p> \n    <p>In her softest voice, Suso asked, \"Grandmama, why does the\
  \ sand sparkle?\"</p> \n    <p>People around the circle smiled. Suso's grandmother\
  \ leaned down and whispered, \"The sand is laced with bits of rose quartz, which\
  \ catches the light. We use it to symbolize the winking stars in the sky. Through\
  \ it, Desna witnesses our words spoken here tonight.\"</p> \n    <p>With one voice,\
  \ the people of the company began to chant to the starry sky:</p> \n    <blockquote>\n\
  \     <p><i>Follow the path, follow the stars, wherever your feet may take you.<br>\
  \ Over the plains, over the hills, through forest and grassy glen.<br> No matter\
  \ the time, no matter the trail, remember that you are loved.<br> I am with you,\
  \ She is above, until we're together again.</i></p>\n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Families\
  \ gathered their children, lovers their partners, and together the people of the\
  \ caravan made their way back to their wagons. Though travel would start again tomorrow,\
  \ tonight they would sleep and dream, secure in the wings of Desna's blessing.</p>\
