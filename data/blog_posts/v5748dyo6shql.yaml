  \ from the village of Mua’bri, I bear an earthenware cauldron, banded in lightning\
  \ and dusted with gold, that the potters of the village bequeath to your majesty\
  \ so that their work might be remembered forever...”</p> \n      <p>Kwibha listened\
  \ to the First Speaker of the Dragon Wardens with one ear, his attention more focused\
  \ on keeping warm. By tradition, these yearly negotiations were hold on this flat\
  \ mountaintop just across the valley from the city of Cloudspire, the air so cold\
  \ that Kwibha’s breath misted forth with every heartbeat. His late sister Jhirabi,\
  \ who’d been training to be a Dragon Warden, said the location actually had been\
  \ chosen because there were few other places where one could treat with a half-dozen\
  \ dragons, but Kwibha would never be so crass as to say so out loud.</p> \n    \
  \  <p><b>“…my rain-child’s third daughter is ready to leave the nest. It is time\
  \ for her to have a territory of her own, a hoard and home atop a good tree. Do\
  \ they still have that lightning-struck tree outside of Mua’bri…?”</b></p> \n  \
  \    <p>For a moment, Kwibha envisioned a group of stout dwarven farmers, dour-faced\
  \ and heavily armed, accompanied by a whimsical fledgling dragon the size of a sheep.\
  \ The farmers would likely be more dangerous. Still, one had to start somewhere,\
  \ and it was upon these formalized exchanges of gifts, territories, and protection\
  \ that the partnership of dwarf and cloud dragon had been built.</p> \n      <div\

  \  <br> \n      <p>Another hour passed, then a second and third, and Kwibha felt\
  \ the frost harden on the white scarf around his neck. Snow crunched underfoot as\
  \ he shifted his weight, and still the dragons and the First Speaker of the Dragon\
  \ Wardens continued their talks. Kwibha cast a sidelong glance at the First Speaker—\
  Jhirabi had said they were chosen for endurance as well as diplomacy.</p> \n   \
  \   <p>And then it was time.</p> \n      <p>“Noble kings,” the First Speaker said,\
  \ for all dragons are accorded the title of kings, “I present to you Second Speaker\
  \ Kwibha of the Bloodmarked.”</p> \n      <p>That was Kwibha’s cue. The dwarf strode\
  \ forward, marshalling every scrap of dignity he possessed. To any other dwarf,\
  \ Kwibha was a person of note, with his gold-embroidered kaftan of cashmere, amber-hilted\
  \ sword, and the scarlet ribbon tied about his brow. The dragons, Kwibha fervently\
  \ hoped, would be equally impressed.</p> \n      <p>“Noble kings of sky and cloud,\
  \ revered ancestors of the storm, you whose wrath is lightning and whose mercy is\
  \ the rain after a long drought,” Kwibha’s voice echoed off the mountaintops, finely\
  \ pitched to carry to the great beings clustered before him, “I come bearing an\
  \ offer from King Thabsing of K’Lereng, called the Blood-Eye.”</p> \n      <p><b>“\
  And what is this offer, Second Speaker?”</b> one of the dragons whispered with a\
  \ voice like the mist, soft yet inescapable. <b>“We have heard his plans of war\
  \ before and have little interest in them.” </b></p> \n      <p>“Today, he proposes\
  \ not war, but justice, not battle, but execution,” Kwibha said smoothly. He held\
  \ out a single hand in the traditional orator’s pose. “Know this, noble kings. On\
  \ the last day of the dry season, in the pirate city of Bloodcove where they celebrate\
  \ the Tempest Day, there will be a great auction of treasures taken from the drowned\
  \ land of Lirgen. Most of the Pirate Council of the Shackles plans to attend, and\
  \ we’ve heard that the Hurricane Queen herself, Tessa Fairwind, shall be present.”\
  </p> \n      <p><b>“And how do you know this thing will happen, Second Speaker?”\
  </b> another cloud dragon asked in a voice that thundered across the mountaintop,\
  \ causing drifts of snow to become tiny avalanches.</p> \n      <p>Kwibha hoped\
  \ they would ask him this. With a great flourish, he swept his arm out and bowed\
  \ genteelly to the assembled wyrms. “I know this, noble kings, for I shall conduct\
  \ the auction myself.”</p> \n      <p><em>This</em> caught the dragons’ attention—\
  and the attention of the Dragon Wardens, for that matter. Kwibha allowed himself\
  \ a small smile. It had taken nearly two years to make the proper introductions,\
  \ to pass himself from one pirate to the next in that stinking city. King Thabsing\
  \ had provided the Lirgeni artifacts, from where it was not entirely clear, but\
  \ it was Kwibha’s work that had brought this day about. Bloodcove was a very different\
  \ place from the orderly, harmonious citadel of Cloudspire, a place of violence,\
  \ greed, and broken oaths, but dwarves lived there as well. Buyers, mostly, to purchase\
  \ the pirates’ stolen goods and send them back to the Mbe’ke, but a few disgraced\
  \ sellers as well, who would trade with the Mbe’ke’s enemies. Kwibha had pretended\
  \ to be one such, and he didn’t know if he’d ever feel properly clean again.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>“The Free Captains are no fools, and they will expect treachery,” Kwibha\
  \ continued in the ensuing silence. “But they will expect it from each other or\
  \ myself. Their ships will be moored at harbor, their sailors carousing, their lieutenants\
  \ and weather-wizards accompanying their captains for protection. The vessels will\
  \ be virtually defenseless in the face of a sudden storm, honored lords of lightning,”\
  \ Kwibha paused, before adding the final bait, “and they will be heavily laden with\
  \ loot from a season’s successful piracy.”</p> \n      <p><b>“Your words intrigue,\
  \ Second Speaker,”</b> said the senior-most dragon in a voice crackling with frost.\
  \ <b>“We will weigh them and give an answer in three day’s time.”</b></p> \n   \
  \   <p><b>“A question, Emissary of the Bloodmarked,”</b> a younger dragon said,\
  \ leaning forward such that Kwibha could see the new scars on their horn, <b>“Your\
  \ king’s plan will destroy the ships, but what of the pirates themselves?”</b></p>\
  \ \n      <p>“A pirate without a ship, honored king, is like a turtle without a\
  \ shell,” said Kwibha, his smile colder than the snow of the mountain. “With the\
  \ Pirate Council trapped in Bloodcove, it will be a simple matter for King Thabsing\
  \ to march his armies down from the mountains and take the city. And then we will\
  \ try them, and we will sentence them, and we will hang these corsairs from every\
  \ tree and doorpost.”</p> \n      <p><em>And then, Jhirabi, you will finally be\
  \ avenged.</em></p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p style=\"font-weight: bold; line-height:\
