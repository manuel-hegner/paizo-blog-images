  \ border=\"0\" align=\"right\"></a> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>Starting off, Seoni\
  \ has a few precast spells, whose effects are already calculated in as part of her\
  \ stat block, including an extended <i>shield, mage armor</i>, and <i>stoneskin</i>.\
  \ She could increase these protections with <i>haste, mirror image</i>, and <i>resist\
  \ energy</i> if given a few rounds to prepare.</p> \n   <p>As a sorcerer, Seoni\
  \ can choose from one of ten different bloodlines. We chose the arcane bloodline,\
  \ which is the default bloodline for existing 3.5 sorcerers as it is the only bloodline\
  \ that grants a familiar. All bloodlines grant a number of bonuses as the sorcerer\
  \ gains levels, such as additional spells known (Seoni receives <i>identify</i>\
  \ at 3rd level, <i>invisibility</i> at 5th level, <i>dispel magic</i> at 7th level,\
  \ and <i>dimension door</i> at 9th level), a bonus class skill (Seoni receives a\
  \ free Knowledge skill of her choice), and a number of special bloodline powers\
  \ (which we will talk about in a bit). New to the final version of the game is bloodline\
  \ arcana. Each bloodline now grants a special bonus to a specific group of spells.\
  \ In Seoni's case, any time she casts a metamagic version of a spell that increases\
  \ the level by at least 1, the DC of that spell increases by +1 (total, not per\
  \ level increased). This means that if Seoni casts a still <i>lightning bolt</i>\
  \ the DC to halve the damage is increased to 21. Other bloodlines grant similar\
  \ abilities. For example, the destined bloodline grants the sorcerer a luck bonus\
  \ on saving throws for 1 round whenever she casts a spell with a range of personal.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>In addition to the arcane bond ability (which allows Seoni to have a familiar),\
  \ the arcane bloodline grants two additional abilities. The first is metamagic adept,\
  \ which allows her to cast metamagic spells without increasing their casting time.\
  \ At her current level, she can use this ability twice per day. It should be noted\
  \ that quicken spell has been changed to allow sorcerers to use it without increasing\
  \ the casting time, meaning that Seoni can save her metamagic adept ability for\
  \ extended and still spells. The second ability is new arcana, which grants Seoni\
  \ an additional spell known (she chose <i>stoneskin</i>).</p> \n   <p>If we were\
  \ to continue to advance Seoni, she would receive a school power at 15th level,\
  \ which would grant her a +2 bonus to the DC of all spells from one school of magic.\
  \ At 20th level, she would undergo an arcane apotheosis, which would allow her to\
  \ cast any metamagic spell without increasing the casting time and allow her to\
  \ burn spell slots to power magic items that expend charges.</p> \n   <p>Moving\
  \ on, we get to Seoni's spell list. There have been a few changes to some of these\
  \ spells, mostly to make them simpler to use, but in some cases to increase their\
  \ power a bit. <i>Ice storm</i>, for example, deals the same amount of damage, but\
  \ now also includes an effect that makes the area difficult terrain and imposes\
  \ a penalty on Perception checks.</p> \n   <p>Of all the spells in the game, none\
  \ has the power to bring things screeching to a halt faster than <i>dispel magic</i>.\
  \ Not only did this spell take a while to adjudicate, it also forced the target\
  \ to recalculate a host of statistics if the spell was particularly successful.\
  \ Now <i>dispel magic</i> requires only a single caster check, and the result is\
  \ applied to all the spells active on the target. It dispels the spell with the\
  \ highest caster level that it can affect. While this reduces its power a bit (although\
  \ it no longer has the +10 limit to the check), it makes the spell a whole lot easier\
  \ to use. <i>Greater dispel magic</i> still allows you to strip off multiple spells,\
  \ but it too only requires a single check. It dispels one spell per four caster\
  \ levels, taking out the spells with the highest caster level that it can effect.\
  \ I should note that you can still use either one of these spells to target a specific\
  \ spell to end that effect, allowing you to try and knock out the enemy's <i>fly</i>\
  \ or <i>stoneskin</i> when it really counts.</p> \n   <p><i>Mirror image</i> has\
  \ also received a bit of a facelift, making it simpler to use. Take a look.</p>\
  \ \n   <blockquote> <b>Mirror Image</b>\n    <br> <b>School</b> illusion (figment);\
  \ <b>Level</b> bard 2, sorcerer/wizard 2\n    <br> <b>Casting Time</b> 1 standard\
  \ action\n    <br> <b>Components</b> V, S\n    <br> <b>Range</b> personal\n    <br>\
  \ <b>Target</b> you\n    <br> <b>Duration</b> 1 min./level\n    <br> \n    <p>This\
  \ spell creates a number of illusory doubles of you that inhabit your square. These\
  \ doubles make it difficult for enemies to precisely locate and attack you.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>When <i>mirror image</i> is cast, 1d4 images plus one image per three\
  \ caster levels (maximum eight images total) are created. These images remain in\
  \ your space and move with you, mimicking your movements, sounds, and actions exactly.\
  \ Whenever you are attacked or are the target of a spell that requires an attack\
  \ roll, there is a possibility that the attack targets one of your images instead.\
  \ If the attack is a hit, roll randomly to see whether the selected target is real\
  \ or a figment. If it is a figment, the figment is destroyed. If the attack misses\
  \ by 5 or less, one of your figments is destroyed by the near miss. Area spells\
  \ affect you normally and do not destroy any of your figments. Spells and effects\
  \ that do not require an attack roll affect you normally and do not destroy any\
  \ of your figments. Spells that require a touch attack are harmlessly discharged\
  \ if used to destroy a figment.</p> \n    <p>An attacker must be able to see the\
  \ figments to be fooled. If you are invisible or the attacker is blind, the spell\
  \ has no effect (although the normal miss chances still apply).</p> \n   </blockquote>\
  \ \n   <p>I also want to take a moment to talk about Seoni's <i>staff of fire</i>.\
  \ Like the previous rules for staves, Seoni can cast all the spells in the staff\
  \ using her caster level (10th) instead of the staff's, which is only 8th. She can\
  \ also use her Charisma modifier and feat bonuses when calculating the save DCs.\
  \ Staves in the new rules contain a total of 10 charges, but they can be recharged.\
  \ Once per day, Seoni can expend a 4th level spell slot (the highest level spell\
  \ contained in the <i>staff of fire</i>) to add 1 charge to the staff. Most of the\
  \ staves have been rebuilt to work within these new rules.</p> \n   <p>That is about\
  \ all for this week. Next week Harsk comes stomping on to the stage as we take a\
  \ look at the iconic ranger. I hear he has favored terrain (the internet), so we\
  \ better watch out!</p> \n   <p> Jason Bulmahn <br> Lead Designer</p> \n  </blockquote>\
