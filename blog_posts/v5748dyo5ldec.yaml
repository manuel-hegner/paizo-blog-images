  \ Society in Croatia, Bosnia, and Slovenia (or South Eastern Europe Calling)</h1>\
  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Monday, May 7, 2012</p> \n   <p>Last month, we highlighted\
  \ Denmark and Venture-Captain Diego Winterborg's efforts to grow Pathfinder Society\
  \ there. We now shift our focus to southeast Europe. Venture-Captain Zrinka Znidarcic's\
  \ report on Pathfinder Society in Croatia, Bosnia, and Slovenia was a very interesting\
  \ read for me and I hope all of you find it interesting as well. </p>\n   <blockquote>\
  \ \n    <p>It is interesting being a Venture-Captain of the only multinational region\
  \ that encompasses three different countries (one of them being in the European\
  \ Union). But, here we are, after barely 9 months of Pathfinder Society presence\
  \ and it's already been a wild ride. From what I can tell, this presence promises\
  \ to continue and grow.</p> \n    <p>Geographically speaking, Croatia is a small\
  \ sliver of a country squished between Slovenia to the northwest and Bosnia and\
  \ Herzegovina to the southeast. The capital of Croatia is Zagreb and this is the\
  \ home base for Pathfinder Society in the tri-country region.</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>It all started like anywhere else—with a home group\
  \ and an overeager GM. I started gaming in 1996. After many years of playing, graduating\
  \ from the university, moving back home, and trying to find somebody to GM fantasy\
  \ roleplaying games, I learned that the only way to make anything happen game-wise\
  \ was to go ahead and do it (contrary to my usual disposition). I started my GMing\
  \ career in 2003, and as soon as Pathfinder Roleplaying Game appeared, we switched\
  \ all the characters and never looked back, going on to play Pathfinder Adventure\
  \ Paths (which we still do to this day).</p> \n    <p>At the time, Croatian fantasy\
  \ fandom had just two significant gaming conventions—Sferakon (the oldest Croatian\
  \ convention established in 1979) and Istrakon (established in 2000). At some point,\
  \ Sferakon had organized RPG events, but none since 2002. Most people were quite\
  \ happy with having home groups and there was little organized public play.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>With only two gaming stores that didn't do so well—one closing its business\
  \ and the other changing owners a few times and giving up on ordering RPG books—\
  there was no local support for RPGs. </p> \n    <p>The region didn't fare well either.\
  \ Our northern neighbor, Slovenia, organized several gaming conventions that didn't\
  \ really take root and the fandom had retreated mostly into individual home groups.\
  \ Bosnia and Herzegovina is still an unconquered land with almost no RPG players\
  \ I am aware of (please email me if you live there and are interested in organizing\
  \ Pathfinder Society).</p> \n    <p>But, several things happened. A lecture on the\
  \ Pathfinder Roleplaying Game at Istrakon 2010, followed by two tables of demo scenarios,\
  \ gained traction and interest and we had a fair number of interested players at\
  \ Istrakon 2011. At the end of August, my Venture-Lieutenant, Maja Skvorc, and I\
  \ announced the first PFS event in the only friendly local gaming store, Carta Magica.\
  \ We just wanted to see what would happen. With over 20 people showing it for that\
  \ first game day, it was clear there was a real interest for the Pathfinder RPG\
  \ and Pathfinder Society in Zagreb. </p> \n    <div class=\"blurb180\">\n     <a\
  \ href=\"/image/content/PathfinderSociety/20120507-Croatia6.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderSociety/20120507-Croatia6_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Currently using Carta Magica as the base\
  \ for regular weekly sessions, we now count on three tables (generally 12–16 players)\
  \ on regular basis. Higher-level characters are still a small minority so we've\
  \ just started scheduling one table for them. With the fluctuation of players, we\
  \ already have more than 70 people signed up on Warhorn.net for our scheduled events.\
  \ It is also interesting to note that most players are in their mid-twenties and\
  \ younger, and among the GMs, we have both experienced and new ones. In fact, several\
  \ of the most active GMs started playing tabletop roleplaying games initially with\
  \ Pathfinder Society.</p> \n    <p>Meanwhile, in Zagreb, a group formed in 2011\
  \ called SRP (Section for Roleplay) founded by Ana Rajner and Bozo Spoljaric. This\
  \ was the first such group dedicated to roleplaying games of all kinds (tabletop\
  \ and LARPs) with the goal of promoting and enabling play. Besides regular lecture-a-week\
  \ (Pathfinder RPG was their first), they also started organizing Game Days every\
  \ 2 to 3 months. This is where Croatian Pathfinder Society attracts the largest\
  \ numbers of players. So far, we have hosted three such events and we see promise\
  \ of even greater growth.</p> \n    <p>Another association is being established\
  \ as we speak at Igranje.org. They not only have tabletop games as primary interest,\
  \ but will also be able to provide completely free venue for Pathfinder Society\
  \ Organized Play. </p> \n    <p>It is really amazing to watch how tabletop gaming\
  \ has emerged in Croatia during the last year, and hopefully this is just the beginning.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Istrakon 2012 featured the first multiplayer session, <i>Year of the\
  \ Shadow Lodge</i>, and was the first big convention with a strong organized play\
  \ presence. With 12 tables in 2 days, it was a great success.</p> \n    <p>This\
  \ year, Sferakon was the host of Eurocon 2012 on April 26–29. Being mostly a literary\
  \ convention, never known for any significant gaming program, it was a great start\
  \ for Pathfinder Society at the oldest Croatian convention. Most importantly, a\
  \ group of Slovenian players were present all 3 days. They are more than willing\
  \ to start growing Pathfinder Society in Slovenia and we're already making plans\
  \ for the first Pathfinder Society event there.</p> \n    <p>The future looks bright\
  \ and interest in the game keeps growing as more people are coming back to the hobby.\
  \ Two new regional conventions have been announced, one in Sarajevo this summer\
  \ and one in Slovenia this November, and that will be an excellent chance to start\
  \ increasing Pathfinder Society outside our home base.</p> \n    <p>In the end I\
  \ want to send a huge thank you to all the GMs for their hard work, to all the players\
  \ who are the lifeblood of Pathfinder Society, and all the organizers who give us\
  \ the support to share the hobby we all love. I want to especially thank Mike for\
  \ having the faith in us and giving this weird little region a chance.</p> \n  \
