  \    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Last week, we shared a no-prep\
  \ character, Urok, to give you a brief glimpse at the orderly aphorite versatile\
  \ heritage. We have another NPC this week showcasing another unrevealed aspect from\
  \ <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq026k5?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Ancestry-Guide\"\
  ><em>Lost Omens Ancestry Guide</em></a>. This week we’re going to preview another\
  \ new versatile heritage: beastkin! I’ll talk a bit more about beastkin after showing\
  \ you the NPC, but for now, let’s look at our no-prep beastkin, Chea.</p> \n   \
  \  <h3>Chea, Student of Unfolding Wind</h3> \n     <p>Born to a large family of\
  \ werecrocodiles in the nation of Jalmeray, Chea was envied by her fellows for her\
  \ strange lack of the werecreature's curse. Chea's mother assured the girl that\
  \ her blessing proved she was meant for great things, though her bitter cousins\
  \ mocked her for her soft heart and lack of killer instinct. One night when she\
  \ was a teenager, she went out for a swim, sick of the insults and teasing from\
  \ her peers. The beastkin accidentally stumbled across an adventurer, who was stargazing\
  \ by the riverside. The strange woman didn't attack, however, instead introducing\
  \ herself as Nisha and inviting Chea to come look at the stars. Nisha pointed out\
  \ a glowing comet in the sky and told Chea that the star was actually an elemental\
  \ lord named Ranginori, and that Nisha's fellow adventurers, the Pathfinders, were\
  \ working to set Ranginori free. When Nisha left that evening, she gave her telescope\
  \ to Chea. From then on, Chea spent her nights gazing up to the glowing star, whispering\
  \ secret prayers in hope they might comfort the trapped god.</p> \n     <p>Chea\
  \ saw the moment her bright star burst across the sky, freeing Ranginori from his\
  \ uncounted years of imprisonment. Knowing the hard journey that Ranginori faced\
  \ ahead of him, Chea was among one of the first to pledge her faith to the elemental\
  \ lord. Encouraged by her mother, Chea approached the Monastery of Unfolding Wind\
  \ in Jalmeray. Though she had to hide her true nature from her fellow acolytes,\
  \ her determination saw her excel in her monk training. Yet when she returned to\
  \ visit her family after her initial studies were complete, she found them decimated\
  \ and scattered. The survivors gave confused, conflicted reports, but several of\
  \ them claimed that Pathfinders had attacked them.</p> \n     <p>Though Chea knew\
  \ her family weren't always saints, she found she couldn't let this go. The monk\
  \ now searches for answers to what truly happened, and vengeance for those who killed\
  \ her kin.</p> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/516e9c59-a320-4bbe-b485-a862cc091321/021821_Chea.jpg\"\

  \ \n     <p><b>Flying Kick</b> [two-actions] Chea launches herself at a foe. She\
  \ makes a Leap or attempts a High Jump or Long Jump. At the end of the jump, if\
  \ she’s adjacent to a foe, she can immediately Strike that foe with an unarmed attack,\
  \ even if the foe is in midair. She falls to the ground after the Strike. If the\
  \ distance she falls is no more than the height of her jump, Chea lands upright\
  \ and takes no damage.</p> \n     <p><b>Pack Tactics</b> If an enemy is within reach\
  \ of Chea and at least two of her allies, that enemy is flat-footed against Chea.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>Powerful Fists</b> Chea’s fist Strikes are treated as cold iron and\
  \ silver and don’t take penalties when making lethal attacks.</p> \n     <h4>Plot\
  \ Hooks</h4> \n     <p>Game Masters may consider the following plot hooks as a means\
  \ of integrating Chea into any Pathfinder Second Edition game.</p> \n     <ul> \n\
  \      <li>Chea seeks out the heroes in hopes of learning a new fighting technique\
  \ to give her a further edge in combat. She’s willing to share an aspect of her\
  \ training in return.</li> \n      <li>As the heroes leave a dungeon, some ruins,\
  \ or another adventuring site, Chea makes her presence known. She challenges the\
  \ heroes to a fight, believing them to be Pathfinders.</li> \n      <li>A whisper\
  \ on the wind guides the heroes to Chea. The monk notes that she’s received a message\
  \ from her god about the whereabouts of a gem that holds another elemental lord.\
  \ Chea believes it is her fate, and the heroes’, to rescue the trapped god.</li>\
  \ \n     </ul> \n     <h4>About Beastkin</h4> \n     <p>Beastkin is a blanket term\
  \ for any person who has gained the ability to partially or fully transform into\
  \ an animal through any number of means, while maintaining a balance with their\
  \ humanoid side. Beastkin might have a lineage that traces directly to werecreature\
  \ parents. Other beastkin might have received their abilities from a deity or even\
  \ as a result of polymorph magic. Regardless of their origin, a beastkin is tied\
  \ to a particular animal, such as bat, eagle, shark, spider, tyrannosaurus, wasp,\
  \ or wolf. This animal is known as the beastkin’s inherent animal. Beastkin feats\
  \ allow a beastkin to further tap into their animalistic connection and gain new\
  \ senses, the ability to fly or swim like their inherent animal, or even fully transform\
  \ into that animal in combat. Beastkin is a rare versatile heritage and you can\
  \ learn all about it when <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq026k5?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Ancestry-Guide\"\
  >Lost Omens Ancestry Guide</a> releases on February 24th!</p> \n     <p style=\"\
