  \ </div>\n     <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Welcome! We’re a\
  \ week out from PaizoCon and you’ve got a whole slate of reveals for new stuff to\
  \ look forward to: <em>Pathfinder Player Core 2</em>,<em>Pathfinder War of Immortals</em>,\
  \ <em>Pathfinder Howl of the Wild</em>, the list goes on! But some of you might\
  \ be looking back thinking, “Sure all this new stuff is great, but I’d really love\
  \ some updates and clarifications for some of these books I bought right before\
  \ the remaster started.”</p>\n      <p>Well, good news! We’ve got a slate of errata\
  \ for you. Right about now, you should find some new entries over at <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/pathfinder/faq\">https://paizo.com/pathfinder/faq</a> for <em>Pathfinder\
  \ Guns &amp; Gears</em>, <em>Pathfinder Rage of Elements</em>, <em>Pathfinder Lost\
  \ Omens Firebrands</em>, and <em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Ancestry Guide</em>. I’ll\
  \ let you read those entries to see the specifics, but some highlights include a\
  \ broad update in the <em>Ancestry Guide</em> entry for re-standardizing the flight\
  \ feats of certain ancestries like sprites and strix to bring them more in line\
  \ with the new standard we’ve set for ancestries with inherent flight following\
  \ the Remaster. We’ve also got a swath of minor updates to combination weapons to\
  \ align with the new standard set by the swap function of the Interact action in\
  \ the Remaster, and some much requested clarifications for <em>Rage of Elements</em>.</p>\n\

  \       <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\"></p>\n      </div>\n      <br>\n      <p>This\
  \ also marks the beginning of a return to normalcy for us following the flurry of\
  \ activity around the OGL events of last year and the need for us to pivot to the\
  \ Remaster project and the introduction of the ORC license. With all of that in\
  \ the rearview mirror and a clear road leading into a bright blue horizon ahead,\
  \ we’re looking to get back on track for the annual errata cycle we had announced\
  \ right before those plans got altered. As part of this pivot, we want to set some\
  \ clear expectations for what the future we’re working toward is going to look like\
  \ for FAQs and errata.</p>\n      <ul>\n       <li><strong>Hardcover Rulebooks:\
  \ </strong>This includes books like <em>Player Core</em>, <em>Guns &amp; Gears</em>,\
  \ <em>Rage of Elements</em>, etc. Our goal for this product line is for it to receive\
  \ two errata and FAQ cycles per year on an as-needed basis, one in the spring/summer\
  \ and one in the fall/winter. This current drop is the spring/summer cycle, so you\
  \ can expect one more errata update before the end of the year!</li>\n       <li><strong>Lost\
  \ Omens Books: </strong>This line of books will receive one errata and FAQ update\
  \ cycle per year on an as-needed basis, coinciding with one of the two hardcover\
  \ rulebook cycles.</li>\n       <li><strong>Adventures: </strong>Our Adventure Path\
  \ line is a monthly periodical and the player content produced in it is intended\
  \ for use with the associated adventures. The standard for player content presented\
  \ in adventures is that it is of uncommon or rare rarity and directly tied to the\
  \ story it is presented with; using this content outside of the associated adventure\
  \ inherently requires GM review and approval (or appropriate sanctioning for use\
  \ in Pathfinder Society organized play). We do not currently have any plans at this\
  \ time to include adventure content in a scheduled errata cycle. We may still do\
  \ errata around particular reprints, such as when compiling an adventure for a hardcover\
  \ release.</li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>So, that’s our roadmap for the errata and\
  \ FAQs going forward! If you’re planning on playing some Pathfinder Society games\
  \ at PaizoCon, make sure to check for any updates your character might have received!</p>\n\
  \      <p>Catch you next time!</p>\n      <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight:\
