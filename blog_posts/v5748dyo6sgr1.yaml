  \ far the largest of the meta-regions in the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01zoj?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-World-Guide\"\
  ><em>Lost Omens World Guide</em></a>, the High Seas consist of, well, all the seas\
  \ and oceans that cover Golarionâ€™s surface. And though the shape of these great\
  \ bodies of water remains largely constant, the sea is ever changing, with new,\
  \ unexpected threats and bounties awaiting over every horizon or washing ashore\
  \ with every wave. That said, not a lot has changed between Pathfinder's first and\
  \ second edition in this region, leaving more room for us to explore all new locations\
  \ and dive deeper into the lore of established but only lightly detailed locales\
  \ and organizations.</p> \n     <p>Among the areas given new revelations are the\
  \ Mordant Spire, the ancient elven outpost formed from the remains of a dead Azlanti\
  \ god; the utopian island nation of Hermea, where the benevolent gold dragon Mengkare\
  \ oversees a grand experiment to perfect humanity; tropical Mediogalti Island, home\
  \ to the pirate port of Ilizmagorti and the secret, jungle citadel of the Red Mantis\
  \ assassins cult!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190625-mordantspiresymbol.jpg\"\

  ></a> \n      <p>Illustration by Mirco Paganessi</p>\n     </div> \n     <p>The\
  \ region of the High Seas we've done the most with in Pathfinder's first decade\
  \ of development is the archipelago known as the Shackles, off Garund's western\
  \ coast. Here, in the shadow of the permanent hurricane called the Eye of Abendego,\
  \ the Free Captains of the Pirate Council rule their fellow buccaneers as much with\
  \ fear and the threat of violence as they do loyalty and the promise of coin. A\
  \ few years back, the Hurricane King Kerdak Bonefist was defeated by an ambitious\
  \ crew of pirates who'd begun their career as simple deckhands on the famed ship\
  \ <em>Wormwood</em>. Replacing Bonefist as the head of the Pirate Council and ruler\
  \ of Port Peril is Hurricane Queen Tessa Fairwind. To the pirates and other natives\
  \ of the Shackles, life is pretty much what it was before the edition change, but\
  \ the Free Pirates, no longer receiving bribes from the government of Sargava, have\
  \ ramped up their operations in the region, leaving the entire southern Arcadian\
  \ Ocean ripe territory for both potential cutthroats and privateers looking to quash\
  \ piracy at its source.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190625-tessafairwind.jpg\"\

  ></a> \n      <p>Illustration by Cynthia F.G.</p>\n     </div> \n     <p>One of\
  \ the most exciting parts of the High Seas region, however, are the lands and settlements\
  \ beneath the waves. New sites in the Inner Sea and Arcadian Ocean are presented\
  \ with exciting adversaries, political intrigues, and adventure seeds for any sea-faring\
  \ campaign. Among them are the aquatic elf city of Irim, the gillman enclave of\
  \ Kienek-Li off the Isle of Kortos, consisting of the coral Boneglade and the buoyant,\
  \ wooden Float, anchored to the ocean floor by giant chains, and the deep-trench\
  \ alghollthu city of Gholinom, dubbed the Passage Outward by its sinister masters.</p>\

  \ including both magical and mundane equipment useful in both maritime and underwater\
  \ exploration, seven new backgrounds such as the Hermean expatriate, scholar of\
  \ Azlant, and storm survivor, and the Red Mantis assassin archetype, allowing cultists\
  \ of the mantis god Achaekek to begin their training as early in their careers as\
  \ second level.</p> \n     <p>Next week, we'll head back to solid ground for a trip\
  \ through the Impossible Lands along the Obari Ocean! On Thursday, Pathfinder Tales\
  \ veteran Chris A. Jackson wraps up his trilogy of Tales of Lost Omens flash fiction\
