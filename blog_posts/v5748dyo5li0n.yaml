  description\">The majority of <a href=\"/products/btpy9g9v\"><em>Inner Sea Races</em></a>\
  \ focuses on how the human ethnicities and non-human races of Golarion see themselves,\
  \ are seen by others, fit into the world, and interact with one another. However,\
  \ Chapter 4 focuses on the mechanics of building and equipping characters of different\
  \ races and ethnicities, and contains a wealth of different traits, feats, spells,\
  \ and equipment for creating a vibrant character immersed in the culture and practices\
  \ of his or her homeland. It also features a handy heritage appendix, which summarizes\
  \ the mechanical effects of choosing a particular race for your character in one\
  \ place.</p> \n    <p>One of my favorite features in this chapter is a short section\
  \ written by Creative Director James Jacobs, explaining that a character raised\
  \ in a region where Taldane (Common) is not the most widely spoken tongue can choose\
  \ their regional language as their starting language instead of Common. From a mechanical\
  \ perspective, it makes sense to give all characters a language in common. However,\
  \ from an in-world perspective, it seems odd that a character born and raised in\
  \ Wati would grow up speaking Taldane and have to learn Osiriani as a second language,\
  \ rather than the other way around. So, I'm glad that <em>Inner Sea Races</em> allows\
  \ players and GMs to choose to represent that Taldane isn't a native tongue for\
  \ many of the residents of the Inner Sea region.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>Whenever\
  \ the Common tongue is listed as a race's starting language (or among the race's\
  \ available choices for starting languages or bonus languages), you can substitute\
  \ for Common any of the other widely used human languages listed on page 6 (for\
  \ example, an elf who was born and raised in Varisia might choose Varisian as one\
  \ of the bonus languages she knows due to a high Intelligence score, or a gnome\
  \ raised in an isolated monastery in Jalmeray might speak Vudrani as his native\
  \ tongue rather than Common). In these cases, Common always remains an option to\
  \ choose at a later date if you wish.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>In other\
  \ news: aquatic elf enthusiasts, rejoice! The heritage appendix in <a href=\"/products/btpy9g9v\"\
  ><em>Inner Sea Races</em></a> now presents the stats for aquatic elves in the same\
  \ format as those for all the other races of the Inner Sea region. You'll be able\
  \ to find them on page 242!</p> \n    <p>Jessica Price<br> <i>Project Manager</i></p>\
