  \ \n     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Greetings, players! Those\
  \ of you who are avid readers of the Paizo Blog know that when we release hardcovers,\
  \ we often release author blogs to give our authors a chance to talk about what\
  \ they wrote for the book. I decided that hardcover authors shouldn’t get to have\
  \ all the fun, so we’ve got not one, but two author blogs for Organized Play coming\
  \ your way!</p> \n      <p>This week’s blog features authors who wrote for Starfinder\
  \ Society’s Season 4: Year of the Data Scourge. In a couple weeks, we’ll be hearing\
  \ from the authors of PFS Year 3: Year of Shattered Sanctuaries. Enjoy!</p> \n \

  >SFS #4-02: Settling Accounts</em></h3> \n      <p>Hi all! I’m Alison Cybe (they/them),\
  \ and I’m pleased to say that Paizo has asked me to create a few adventures for\
  \ them. By now, you’ll have had a chance to play my most recent Paizo project, <a\
  \ href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02c6t?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-503-Combatants-Concerto-Fugue-of-the-Traitor\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Scenario 5-03: Combatant’s Concerto: Fugue of the Traitor</em></a>,\
  \ which is a murder mystery adventure in which you’re trying to root out an enemy\
  \ agent while also exploring themes of the crimes of imperialism and radical social\
  \ change conflicting with terrorism. But today I’ve been asked to discuss an earlier\
  \ work: <a herf=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq027p5?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-402-Settling-Accounts\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #4-02: Settling Accounts</em></a>.</p> \n     \
  \ <p>On one level, I’m super glad, because I had the chance to introduce a new species\
  \ into the Starfinder setting for this adventure. I wanted to write rabbitfolk because\
  \ they’re awesome, but I also wanted to make them feel genuinely different, new,\
  \ and unique to the setting. So I gave them their own unique culture, nature, and\
  \ physiology. But that isn’t all I wanted to do with the adventure. I’m not ashamed\
  \ to say that my adventures are political in nature. All art is political, and the\
  \ games we play are as much an artform as they are hobby. <em>Settling Accounts</em>\
  \ is an exploration into cultural contamination. It follows a Pact World celebrity\
  \ whose first contact with an indigenous species, while not aggressive or of ill-intent,\
  \ inadvertently causes significant and irreparable harm to the native culture. This\
  \ type of story isn’t restricted to fiction; it does and has happened countless\
  \ times across the world. We need look no further than studies into so-called cargo\
  \ cults or the “invasion via media” in countries such as Bhutan to see it occur.\
  \ Every year, we hear of more actions taken by nations to subsume and eradicate\
  \ indigenous cultures such as unmarked graves in Canada’s Indian residential schools\
  \ or the abuse of Australia’s Stolen Generation. We’re used to thinking of these\
  \ abuses as things of the past, but they happen today. They happen now. And they\
  \ do not require the point of a gun. They can happen with simple, thoughtless, arrogant\
  \ belief in one’s own correctness.</p> \n      <br> \n      <h3>Dennis Muldoon (he/him)<br>\
  \ <em style=\"font-size: 15;\">SFS #4-10: The Way In</em></h3> \n      <p>Hello!\
  \ I'm Dennis Muldoon (he/him), and in Season 4 of Starfinder Society I was delighted\
  \ to write both <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02aks?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-410-The-Way-In\"\
  ><em>SFS #4-10: The Way In</em></a> and the new interactive special, <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/products/btq02c83?Starfinder-Society-Special-499-A-Time-of-Crisis\"\
  ><em>SFS #4-99: A Time of Crisis</em></a>. These presented very different challenges\
  \ to write, and I enjoyed both quite a bit. For <em>The Way In</em>, I was inspired\
  \ to create an adventure that felt like an action movie, complete with a villain\
  \ monologue. My favorite part is the dramatic scene in the conclusion. For <em>A\
  \ Time of Crisis</em>, I really enjoyed the process of thinking through the challenges\
  \ PCs would face given the premise of the adventure, and then making sure they were\
  \ represented in the adventure. My favorite part was coming up with opportunities\
  \ for PCs to dictate how they solve problems and improve their situation.</p> \n\

  \ World’s Ambition;<br> PFS #3-17: Dreams of a Dustbound Isle</em></h3> \n     \
  \ <p>Hello! I’m Matt Duval and author for <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02d5f?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-317-Dreams-of-a-Dustbound-Isle\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-17: Dreams of a Dustbound Isle</em></a> and\
  \ <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02akt?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-411-A-Worlds-Ambition\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #4-11: A World's Ambition</em></a>. I also got\
  \ to write the return to Salvation’s End for this October, <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02dw9?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-510-Shadow-of-the-Vault-Lord\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #5-10: Shadow of the Vault Lord</em></a> as well\
  \ as some other adventures from prior years. Grateful to get asked back!</p> \n\
  \      <p>I went down a lengthy wiki-hole learning about gray goo scenarios for\
  \ <em>A World’s Ambition</em> and imagining the culture and environment that might\
  \ arise, but I also did a deep dive on robot dragons. I’d put dragons in everything\
  \ if they’d let me, and Jenny Jarzabski’s initial email already mentioned them.\
  \ Yes!! I also included some fun, subtle references that might clue in the observant\
  \ about the true nature of the adventure’s omnipresent antagonist.</p> \n      <p><em>The\
  \ Dustbound Isle</em> is packed with my other favorite things: surreal extraplanar\
  \ events, mysteries and puzzles for the players to solve, and so many tie-ins to\
  \ prior adventures. I pulled ideas for nightmares from <em>Pathfinder RPG Horror\
  \ Adventures</em>, my most-used PFS1 sourcebook.</p> \n      <p>And as for <em>Shadow\
  \ of the Vault Lord</em>… patience. Your doom comes soon enough, feeble heroes!</p>\

  \ <p>Heylo! I’m Ivis K. Flanagan, and I wrote <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02aku\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #4-12: A Festive Operation</em></a>. This scenario\
  \ takes the holidays celebrated through the month of Kuthona that Jenny first shared\
  \ with us and lets the players actually experience them. To me, holidays are about\
  \ families—the ones you’re given, the ones you’re making, and, most importantly,\
  \ the ones you choose to love. My goal with this “Starfinder Holiday Special” was\
  \ to help others feel that love and hopefully bring a smile as well. The reunion\
  \ at the end has to be my favorite part because it opens a surprise and brings together\
  \ family who chose to be.</p> \n      <p>Looking forward, I’m a contributing author\
  \ to a few announced and unannounced upcoming Paizo projects, including some cool\
  \ stuff coming in <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02d4w\"><em>Starfinder\
  \ Interstellar Species</em></a> this October. Outside of writing projects, I can\
  \ be found running Organized Play games, brewing plans for another year of Extra\
  \ Life fundraising shenanigans, and chilling with my cat. You can find me on twitter\
  \ <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NorseButterfly\">@NorseButterfly</a> where I am\

  ><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #4-15: Feuding Faiths</em></a>. Previously, I've\

  \ campaigns, and I'm currently the GM for the <em>Young and Adventurous</em> podcast\
  \ on the <a href=\"http://knowdirectionpodcast.com/\">Know Direction network</a>.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>For <em>Live Adventure Extreme!</em>, I had the great fortune to work\
  \ with Thurston Hillman as my developer. Getting to add a chapter to the Society’\
  s relationship with Zo! was a treat, and I really enjoyed the chance to take some\
  \ of the established NPCs and add to their stories. As part of my research for the\
  \ project I contacted Starfinder Developer Jenny Jarzabski, who had created the\
  \ wonderful announcer duo of Lethea and Quill, to make sure I got the tone of her\
  \ creations down accurately—I hope it worked!</p> \n      <p>In <em>Feuding Faiths</em>,\
  \ developer Jessica Catalan and I got to explore how religion works without a monopoly\
  \ on divine magic as such—very different than in pre-Gap Golarion! We also tried\
  \ to broaden the view of worshippers of each of the key religions, so that the “\
  bad guys” don’t always wear their guilt on their sleeve. (Or DO they? Hmm...) I\
  \ hope people enjoy them!</p> \n      <p>You can find me hopefully running a table\
  \ at a con sometime soon and as “Scott D. Young, Author” on the holosphere. (The\
  \ “D.” is important—ordinary Scott Young's are everywhere, and there are even a\
  \ couple of “Scott Young, Author” usernames out there!)</p> \n      <br> \n    \

  \ more of you might know me as a GM or Venture Captain over the last decade, I’\
  ve been fortunate to have recently seen <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02asb?Starfinder-Bounty-2-Test-Flight\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Bounty #2: Test Flight</em></a> released! Crafting <em>Test Flight</em>\
  \ was an extremely fun process—it allowed me to tap into my background in science\
  \ and engineering from when I was working towards a PhD in geophysics and as a researcher\
  \ for the U.S. Army, while also giving several nods to classic spaceborne science\
  \ fiction encounters at the same time. I’m most happy that the adventure allows\
  \ players to have so much agency in deciding how to tackle each challenge, allowing\
  \ it to be re-playable without feeling repetitive.</p> \n      <p>I'm also very\
  \ excited for the upcoming release of <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02dw7\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #4-05: The Arclord Who Never Was</em></a>. I don’\
  t want to get ahead of myself and give away any spoilers, but I will say this: make\

  \ Takedown</em></h3> \n      <p>Hello! I’m Kendra Leigh Speedling, a freelancer\
  \ for both Pathfinder and Starfinder. This past year, I wrote <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02c33?Starfinder-OneShot-3-System-Takedown\"\
  ><em>Starfinder One-Shot #3: System Takedown</em></a>, where a disparate group of\
  \ rebels must infiltrate a Veskarium military communications facility to broadcast\
  \ proof of the misdeeds of a corrupt Veskarium consul on Pulonis, the pahtra home\
  \ world. <em>System Takedown</em> has a unique twist: the rebels are livestreaming\
  \ the infiltration (with their location scrambled, of course) on the channel of\
  \ one of the PC pregens! So if you’re running the game on a stream yourself, your\
  \ players can respond to its chat as if it were the in-game one. I provided scripted\
  \ chat responses for games without an actual live chat, and I had fun coming up\
  \ with things viewers of a Starfinder vid channel might say. I also enjoyed the\
  \ chance to have the PCs strike back at the Veskarium’s colonization, and while\
  \ the adventure doesn’t free Pulonis, it does—hopefully!—make a part of it a nicer\
  \ place to live.</p> \n      <p>Other than <em>System Takedown</em>, my most recent\
  \ work has appeared in <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02aly?Starfinder-Drift-Crisis\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Drift Crisis</em></a> and <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02d8j?Pathfinder-Dark-Archive\"\
