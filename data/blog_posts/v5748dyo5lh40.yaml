  \ The inaugural season of the <a href=\"pfsacg\">Pathfinder Society Adventure Card\
  \ Guild</a> marches on, and I thought you might like an update on how the pirate\
  \ PCs are progressing.</p> \n     <h2>Avast, mateys! Story spoilers for Adventure\
  \ #2 of the Season of the Shackles lurk below!</h2> \n     <p>Love is in the air\
  \ here in the Inner Sea, and the Lady of Tidewater Rock needs your help to choose\
  \ a helpmeet! She's got a bevy of suitors, but her eye lingers on one \"Heartbreak\"\
  \ Hinsin, apparently despite his ominous name. There are many who'd raise an objection\
  \ at this proposed wedding, including the oh-so-charming Master Scourge, but you're\
  \ around to help ensure that love conquers all. Surely Hinsin's heartbreaking days\
  \ are over?</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\" style=\"margin: 10px 0;\"> <a\

  \ by Bryan Sola\n     </div> \n     <p>Having earned the lady's trust, you embark\
  \ on a mission to deliver supplies to an isolated settlement badly in need of supplies.\
  \ The hapless hamlet has fallen afoul of a tribe of marauding grindylows, and the\
  \ tentacled little terrors (yuck) are intercepting all attempts to reach them. Lady\
  \ Smythee has enlisted a ransacking goblin pirate and his weidling vessel to help\
  \ you sneak up on the grindylow hideout. After a whole lot of really gross-looking\
  \ monsters, and some truly incorrigible behavior from your goblin pirate ally, you\
  \ manage to get relief to the settlement, and Lady Smythee rewards you generously.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Apparently, your reputation precedes you among the aquatic denizens\
  \ of the Shackles, because a badly crippled fishfolk woman offers to handsomely\
  \ reward you for enacting a little vengeance upon the sea devils who maimed her\
  \ and stole her spawn. Pirates and revenge go hand in hand, so you eagerly set out\
  \ to slaughter some sea devils and make a little old lady happy.</p> \n     <p>Back\
  \ in the land of two-legged employers, \"Heartbreak\" Hinsin and Lady Smythee are\
  \ sponsoring a wedding regatta, and the prize is a sweet new ship. The rules of\
  \ the race: \"Many men enter; one man leaves.\" Your uncle Mad Max would be proud.\
  \ Will your doughty band of pirates have what it takes to take down the other sailors?\
  \ You'll have to play to find out!</p> \n     <h2>MOAR CARD SPOILERS</h2> \n   \
