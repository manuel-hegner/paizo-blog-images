  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Wednesday, August 6, 2008</p> \n   <p>So, if you'll allow\
  \ me a moment here to go off on a tangent that's near and dear to my black, twitching,\
  \ tainted heartâ€”let me talk for a bit about the demon lords of Golarion.</p> \n\
  \   <p>I've always been a fan of demons. I've written at length on my personal blog,\
  \ on messageboards, in editorials, and in various books about this admiration of\
  \ all things Abyssal. The one person I've met who can match (or exceed) this perfectly\
  \ normal and perfectly healthy obsession is Erik Mona. So with both of us pulling\
  \ some key strings behind the scenes of Golarion, it shouldn't be too much of a\
  \ surprise that demon lords are going to play a pretty key role in the world.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>With the new Second Darkness Adventure Path starting up, we'll be doing\
  \ quite a bit with those demon lords. In the months to come, you can expect to see\
  \ a few new demons popping into the Pathfinder Bestiary at times (including at least\
  \ one well over CR 20 menace), at LEAST one prestige class for demon worshipers,\
  \ and in <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy84bc\">Pathfinder #18</a>, an 8-page article\
  \ about the demon lords themselves. For those who can't wait that long, we've put\
  \ a preview into the hardcover <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy80ic\">Pathfinder Chronicles\
  \ Campaign Setting</a> that lists nearly 30 of the world's known demon lords.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>To long-time players of the game, many of the names on that list will\
  \ look familiar. Many of the names are from real-world mythology (perhaps with a\
  \ few spelling changes here and there), while more than a few are classic demon\
  \ lords that, thanks to Necromancer Games' Tome of Horrors, are open content. For\
  \ now, this list in the hardcover is pretty much all we've got on our demon lords,\
  \ but since so many of the demons are established names, I thought it'd be helpful\
  \ to list where they're all from.</p> \n   <p><b>Real-World Mythology</b>: Abraxas,\
  \ Aldinach, Baphomet, Dagon, Flauros, Haagenti, Kostchtchie, Lamashtu, Nocticula,\
  \ Orcus, Pazuzu, Shax, and Socothbenoth are all from various real-world myths (although\
  \ in some cases, like Orcus, the real-world inspiration is a mythological place\
  \ rather than a being).</p> \n   <p><b>Open Sources</b>: A few old favorites, like\
  \ Baphomet, Jubilex, Kostchtchie, and Pazuzu, appear in the <i>Tome of Horrors Revised</i>.\
  \ Of these, Jubilex is the only one who doesn't really have a real-world mythological\
  \ source. (Those interested in keeping track of which version is the open content\
  \ Jubilex and which one isn't the open one need look no further than the spelling\
  \ of his name, by the way.)</p> \n   <p><b>Brand New Demon Lords</b>: And that leaves\
  \ us with 16 brand new demon lords: the razor-edged Andirifkhu, the brutish simian\
  \ Angazhan, the mysterious sphinx Areshkagal, the poisonous and fungoid Cyth-V'sug,\
  \ the insectoid infestation Deskari (whose freaky swarming minions are illustrated\
  \ here), the froglike and ravenous Gogunta, the murderous werewolf Jezelda, the\
  \ ghoulish Kabriri, the creeping spider-thing Mazmezz, the deformed and hateful\
  \ hag Mestama, the dangerously seductive Sifkesh, the troll god Urxehl, the stony\
  \ gargoyle Xoveron, the dinosaurian troglodyte Xevgavizeb, and beautiful but vampiric\
  \ Zura. I <i>think</i> that's all of them. These guys and gals were created specifically\
  \ for Golarion (or in a few cases, imported from my own home-brew campaign world),\
  \ and beyond a few mentions elsewhere in print, we haven't said much about them\
  \ yet. That's a situation I hope to change over the next few months, though!</p>\
