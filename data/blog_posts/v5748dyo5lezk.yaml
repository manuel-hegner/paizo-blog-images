  \     <p><b>What does choosing to pick up at Gen Con mean?</b><br> Shortly before\
  \ the convention we will charge your card and, where appropriate, give you access\
  \ to the corresponding PDF. (This will happen at the same time as subscribers who\
  \ aren't picking up at Gen Con—your PDFs won't be delayed by choosing to pick up\
  \ at Gen Con.) For convention pickup, 7% sales tax will be added to your order—\
  but you won't pay any shipping fees. To guarantee availability of your subscription\
  \ items at Gen Con, you must pick up your subscriptions from the Paizo booth by\
  \ Saturday, August 17th when the exhibitor hall closes.</p> \n     <p><b>When do\
  \ I have to pick up my subscription by:</b><br> In order to make sure you are able\
  \ to get all of your subscription items, we recommend picking up your subscriptions\
  \ as soon as possible once you get to Gen Con. We are only able to ensure availability\
  \ of subscription products through Saturday when the exhibitor hall closes. You\
  \ can still come by for subscription pick up on Sunday, but we can't guarantee the\
  \ subscription items availability.</p> \n     <p><b>What do I need to pick up my\
  \ subscription items?</b><br> Bring your ID, and make sure you know what email address\
  \ you use for logging into Paizo.com.</p> \n     <p><b>What happens if I choose\
  \ to pick up at Gen Con but end up not being able to pick up my items?</b><br> If\
  \ you select the option on the website to pick up subscriptions at Gen Con but do\
  \ not actually pick them up at the show, the sales tax will be credited to your\
  \ account, you will be charged for shipping and we will ship your items to you as\
  \ soon as possible.</p> \n     <p><b>Is there anything else I might want to keep\
  \ in mind when deciding if I want to pick up my subscriptions at Gen Con?</b><br>\
  \ There is a lot of items that can be picked up this year! If you subscribe to multiple\
  \ subscription lines, you'll want to keep in mind how much room you have in your\
  \ suitcase, especially for the Adventure Card Game which is a very big box (14.25\
  \ x 12.75 x 4 inches)!</p> \n     <p><b>I can't make it to Gen Con, can my friend,\
  \ family member, partner, husband/wife pick up my subscriptions?</b><br> Nope, subscriptions\
  \ must be picked up by the account holder. We will not release subscription pick\
  \ ups to anyone but the subscriber.</p> \n     <p><b>What if I have more questions\
  \ about picking up subscription items?</b><br> Let customer service know! You can\
  \ email us, <a href=\"mailto:customer.service@paizo.com?Subject=Gen%20Con%20Subscription%20Pick%20Up\"\
  >customer.service@paizo.com</a>, you can post in the <a href=\"/messageboards/paizo/customerService\"\
  >customer service forum</a>, or give us a call (425-250-0800, Monday-Friday from\
  \ 10:00 AM - 5:00 PM Pacific time).</p> \n     <p>Can't wait to see you in Indy!</p>\
