  \  <h1>Varisia: Players Welcome</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Wednesday, May 9, 2007</p>\
  \ \n   <p>One of the biggest challenges when starting a new campaign is getting\
  \ your players invested in the world. Sure, you may have set up the adventure and\
  \ prepared all your notes, memorized your maps and picked out accents for the various\
  \ local NPCs the party will meet... but what about your players? They can't exactly\
  \ read the same source material you are without tripping over spoilers, and sitting\
  \ down for a three-hour lecture about the local history and customs of their home\
  \ region isn't most groups' idea of a fun first session. So how do you get that\
  \ information across?</p> \n   <p>For <i>Pathfinder</i>, we've made it easy. Instead\
  \ of all that hassle, you can just hand your players the <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7xpx\"\
  >Rise of the Runelords Player's Guide</a> (which you <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7xpn\"\
  >get as a free bonus if you sign up as a charter subscriber</a> before the first\
  \ book ships in August) and let them go to town, entirely spoiler-free. What's more,\
  \ each Adventure Path to come will have its own specific player's guide filled with\
  \ information to help players get their bearings in the world and craft unique,\
  \ interesting backstories for their characters... so much so that DMs will probably\
  \ want to pick a copy up for themselves as well.</p> \n   <p>Inside the player's\
  \ guide, you can expect to find: </p>\n   <ul>\n    <li>Full-page maps and art of\
  \ Sandpoint (the starting town from \"Burnt Offerings\") and Varisia (the whole\
  \ region the Adventure Path takes place in), plus detailed write-ups on both.</li>\
  \ \n    <li>World-specific information on the core races—the things that make elves,\
  \ dwarves, and all the rest unique in <i>Pathfinder</i> and <i>GameMastery Modules</i>.</li>\
  \ \n    <li>How to tailor the core classes to Varisia, and specifically to the Rise\
  \ of the Runelords Adventure Path. Trying to decide which deity or favored enemy\
  \ to pick? Unsure what your wizard's motivation to go adventuring is? This section's\
  \ for you.</li> \n    <li>New world-specific feats.</li> \n    <li>New non-magical\
  \ items and weapons popular in Varisia. (What the heck is a \"star knife\" or a\
  \ \"dogslicer,\" anyhow?)</li> \n   </ul>\n   <p></p> \n   <p>Since this is one\
  \ of the first detailed looks the public will be getting at Varisia and our campaign\
  \ setting as a whole, all of the information in the player's guide will eventually\
  \ be available online for free download in addition to the printed version. But\
  \ after seeing the amount of art and information presented in this 16-page booklet,\
  \ you might not want to wait... particularly since it's likely cheaper than any\
  \ of the snacks at your gaming table (and <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7xpn\">free\
  \ to subscribers</a>).</p> \n   <p>Still not excited? <i>Pathfinder</i> editor and\
  \ Adventure Path veteran Wes Schneider, who's writing the guide, kindly offered\
  \ this preview quote which shows that, despite its mysterious monuments, rich adventure,\
  \ and fierce independence, the land of Varisia isn't for everyone:</p> \n   <blockquote>\
  \ \n    <p><i>Savagery and regressivity epitomize the disfigured lands of Varisia.\
  \ Jagged mountain chains break the worthless, dusty clay at queer and reckless lengths.\
  \ Tangled forests grow wild with titan weeds—the flora of these fecund briars little\
  \ more than tenacious brambles. Blasted reaches of cracked earth and rolling scrub\
  \ form the parched paradises of all manner of backward savages, including the doomed\
  \ final generations of humanity's brutish ancestors. And everywhere the land bears\
  \ the scars of a forgotten people whose eroding ruins and savage attempts at artistry\
  \ litter a landscape already scarred by its own geological leprosy.</i> <br><b>—\
  Darvayne Gios Amprei, <i>Merciless: Abendigo, Belkzen, Varisia, and Other Hells</i></b></p>\
