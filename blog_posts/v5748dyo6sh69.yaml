  \    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">In the holovids, they make\
  \ stowing away look practically romantic.</p> \n     <p>Starship corridor lights\
  \ pulse, jump-suited crew members stand at their stations, and there’s our hero,\
  \ crouching dramatically in the foreground. She’s beautiful and savvy, her hair\
  \ flowing and streaked neon as she avoids detection by a laser’s edge. She darts\
  \ past enemies like a shooting star in the night, spiriting herself away in the\
  \ ship’s cargo hold. She steals her ride as easy as if she’d harnessed a runaway\
  \ enercycle. The plot moves on.</p> \n     <p>Except real life ain’t the holovids,\
  \ and I’m no hero. My name is Rayuhl Rengott. Technically, I’m a thief. Also technically,\
  \ I’m a murderer. That last one is patently false, but we’ll get to that later.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>I’m not beautiful or savvy, either. I hiss when I talk—and I don’t even\
  \ have hair. I’m as bald as the dead landscape of my beloved homeworld. Unlike most\
  \ of my fellow Eoxians, though, I’m very much alive.</p> \n     <p>Yes, there are\
  \ creatures on Eox other than just putrefied corpsefolk, skeletal bone troopers,\
  \ and necrovite spellcasters. And we aren’t all Absalom Station’s most foolhardy\
  \ traders or undead wannabes living in dystopian bubble cities.</p> \n     <p>Some\
  \ of us are living, breathing elebrians. Those long-skulled, dead-eyed, shrivel-skinned\
  \ monsters you think of when you hear the name “Eox”? They were once us, except\
  \ now they’re among the most powerful walking dead. And we are at their mercy.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>You seem confused. Fair enough. I’ll explain.</p> \n     <p>Long, long\
  \ before the Gap, a handful of elebrians survived our kin’s annihilation of the\
  \ world. As second-class citizens, we’ve lived on our destroyed planet for untold\
  \ generations ever since, passing flesh-and-blood legacies to our descendants. We\
  \ try to keep the ravenous undead at bay for a half-dozen decades or so before we\
  \ expire. We live only where our undead overlords deign to create hospitable environments\
  \ for us. We perform the jobs they graciously hand out—if we’re lucky, it’s hard\
  \ labor. If we’re not, we fight to the death for their amusement and profit in sick\
  \ events streamed galaxy-wide from the Halls of the Living.</p> \n     <p>Like I\
  \ said, we’re at their mercy. For most of us, it’s the only way to stay alive.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Which brings me to my current predicament. I’m peering out of the open\
  \ cargo bay of this starship I hopped from Absalom Station. All around me are desolate\
  \ hills, fossilized trees, miasmic eddies—you know, typical Dead Planet stuff. This\
  \ is Eox, all right, but it’s not my beloved home city of the Pyre. Instead, it’\
  s some desiccated place nearby, with the Pyre’s power-generating tower off in the\
  \ hazy distance. </p> \n     <p>And I’m staring right at the bone sage who issued\
  \ my death-warrant—a destroy-on-sight, as I believe the Eoxian authorities call\
  \ it—over high crimes of murder and theft from his personal palace.</p> \n     <div\

  \     </div> \n     <p>Remember when I said I wasn’t savvy?</p> \n     <p>I thought\
  \ I was stowing away on an AbadarCorp freighter bound for the loading docks of the\
  \ Pyre. The plan was simple. I’d slip into the city, meet up with my old Redbloods\
  \ crew, and help them pull a job big enough to buy a new life for all of us—one\
  \ meant for the living!— on Absalom Station. They’d lined up the heist in the elite\
  \ suites of the arcology, and I’d leveraged my Absalom connections. This job would\
  \ buy me a whole new identity, and it would afford my friends enough credits to\
  \ comfortably emigrate from this dead rock. Win-win.</p> \n     <p>Except for that\
  \ planet-blasted bone sage Kalantrodoch. He calls himself the Unburning. I call\
  \ him the Bum-squirming. He’s a rabid zombified squox-rat if there ever was one.\
  \ He also happens to rule the Pyre. And he’s the reason I had to flee Eox three\
  \ years ago. </p> \n     <p>Look, I was minding my own business—okay, okay, I had\
  \ broken into Kalantrodoch’s sky-mansion. I planned to steal some ancient tech artifact\
  \ the Redbloods had heard he’d smuggled in from Castrovel. I had the thing in my\
  \ hot little hands, too. It looked like a small datapad, but it was made from a\
  \ strange metal covered in Elven runes, and was meant to be strapped on the wrist\
  \ or ankle.</p> \n     <p>Just as I was ducking out of that awful place, I heard\
  \ footsteps coming into the vault. I hid behind some technosafes, and I heard Kalantrodoch\
  \ himself chatting in his horrifically sibilant voice to some of his cronies.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“We’ll put it in the water,” the bone sage had said. “In a fortnight,\
  \ our problem disa—”</p> \n     <p>Whatever <em>that</em> meant. I didn’t hear the\
  \ rest, because Kalantrodoch happened to walk past that particular technosafe at\
  \ that particular time, and the jig was up. He would have caught me and likely thrown\
  \ me into prison for life had I not had a vial of rotdust on me. I threw it in his\
  \ face and he breathed in ground-up undead skin. Corpses hate that—they find it\
  \ disgusting, on par with cannibalism. Go figure.</p> \n     <p>Anyway, it was just\
  \ the distraction I needed to duck out of the vault. From there, I slinked out of\
  \ the sky-mansion, and I promptly pawned the Castrovellian tech on the Station.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>That’s how I earned my death-warrant from Kalantrodoch the Unburning.\
  \ Why he decided to tell the Pact that I murdered someone is beyond me. I guess\
  \ he takes thefts from his personal home rather personally. Either way, it doesn’\
  t matter, because ol’ Bum-squirming has made sure I can never safely return to Eox\
  \ in my current identity. Hence the current plan. And my current predicament.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Because I can tell that the bone sage I’m seeing is Kalantrodoch by\
  \ his eyes, which do burn like some sort of unholy Asmodean forges. Why he’s out\
  \ here in the gods-forsaken wastelands outside the Pyre is beyond me. And why he’\
  s meeting an apparently legitimate Abadaran merchant is also a mystery. </p> \n\
  \     <p>My best bet is to creep undetected around these cases of cargo—probably\
  \ supplies for those monstrous necrovites in the arcology—and simply vanish. Then,\
  \ I’ve just got to hope my environmental protections last long enough for me to\
  \ hike the rest of the way to the Pyre. This job can still happen.</p> \n     <p>I\
  \ have to get dangerously close to Kalantrodoch as I pick my way around the ship’\
  s perimeter, though. I see he’s got two corpsefolk cronies with him. Ugh, at least\
  \ I don’t have to smell the stench of rotting flesh no doubt wafting up from them.\
  \ Thanks to the tympanal cluster implants in my ears, I can even hear what they’\
  re whispering to each other while they’re waiting for the Abadaran to review the\
  \ cargo manifest.</p> \n     <p>“That’s the crate,” Kalantrodoch says, nodding to\
  \ one small, inconspicuous box. “Undetectable, and the scientists promised it’d\
  \ work this time. They’ve learned much in three years.” </p> \n     <p>I stop cold,\
  \ heart racing. What is he saying?</p> \n     <p>“We’re just weeks away from ten\
  \ thousand fewer breathers.”</p> \n     <p>I stifle a shocked gasp. What I heard\
  \ three years ago suddenly makes sense.</p> \n     <p><em>Our problem disappears.\
  \ Ten thousand fewer breathers.</em></p> \n     <p>Kalantrodoch is planning to wipe\
  \ out most of the living elebrian population in the Pyre. With some sort of undetectable\
  \ poison? I can only imagine the horrors he means to visit on my kind. Our numbers\
  \ are well known, and for years the bone sage has subtly complained to Orphys that\
  \ his living workers are a drain on resources. </p> \n     <p>Looking around wildly,\
  \ I assess the scene. There are stacks and stacks of crated goods—this is not a\
  \ small shipment; Kalantrodoch is smuggling the highly illegal poison in with a\
  \ vast array of legitimate goods. That’s probably why he’s meeting the Abadaran\
  \ outside the city limits. </p> \n     <p>I do see a rack near me with a few high-octane\
  \ enercycles. I could take one of them and flee to the city. But they’re noisy,\
  \ and the walking corpses would blast me away before I could get too far. And I’\
  ve got to get to the city without heat on my trail, because I have to warn my friends.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Desperately hoping to find anything that might help, I start quietly\
  \ prying lids off crates. There’s one with a dozen second skin suits, one with assorted\
  \ computer circuitry, and finally, one I can work with.</p> \n     <p>A crate full\
  \ of grenades.</p> \n     <p>I’m going to have to time this perfectly if it’s going\
  \ to work. Thinking quickly, I lash the open crate of grenades to the back of one\
  \ of the bikes, then I grab another cycle. Standing between them like I’m leading\
  \ two prize show shotalashus, I slowly walk the bikes around the perimeter of the\
  \ site. </p> \n     <p>I position myself just out of sight of the bone sage and\
  \ the Abadaran. I’ll set one bike off riderless to distract them, I think. Then,\
  \ when chaos reigns, I’ll ride in the opposite direction—toward Pyre—and none of\
  \ them will be the wiser. The crate of grenades is mine, just in case I need any\
  \ weapons once I slink into the city.</p> \n     <p>It’s a great plan, I think,\
  \ as I start up the enercycles’ engines as quietly as I can. Until I realize I’\
  ve misjudged the bone sage and his cronies’ line of sight.</p> \n     <p>“A breather!”\
  \ one of the corpsefolk shouts, pointing in my direction. Both zombies pull out\
  \ massive arc rifles and level them in my direction.</p> \n     <p>Instinctively,\
  \ I rev the boom-cycle’s engine. Yanking a grenade out, I pull the pin and drop\
  \ it back into the crate. I let the boom-cycle fly toward the corpses and the Abadaran,\
  \ and I hop on the other cycle, shooting toward the spire in the distance.</p> \n\
  \     <p>The blast wave from the ensuing explosion nearly knocks me off balance.\
  \ I can hear the shrieks of Kalantrodoch and his minions. I hear nothing from the\
  \ Abadaran, and I can only hope that they survived.</p> \n     <p>I did say I wasn’\
  t a hero. </p> \n     <p>A few minutes pass as I zoom along the shriveled Eoxian\
  \ landscape toward the spire. When I dare to look back, it seems my plan didn’t\
  \ sideline ol’ Bum-squirming for as long as I’d hoped. He’s racing behind me on\
  \ a scorched enercycle, minions nowhere to be found, his long canines dripping with\
  \ acidic saliva and his horrific, fiery eyes screaming with rage. </p> \n     <p>“\
  Rengott!” he shouts. </p> \n     <p>Great. He knows it’s me. I kick the enercycle,\
  \ bobbing and weaving, hoping I’ll be able to lose him.</p> \n     <p>This could\
  \ be an awkward homecoming. I’ve just got to make it to Pyre alive…</p> \n    </blockquote>\
