  \    <p>by Richard Lee Byers</p> \n    <h2>Chapter Four: The Master's Table</h2>\
  \ \n    <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n     <p><span itemprop=\"description\"\
  >As more and more sunlight reached the canyon floor, Dron made a steadily increasing\
  \ effort to keep to the shade. Sometimes, even though raising his maimed hand made\
  \ his face twist with pain, he used it to shield his eyes.</span></p> \n     <p>\"\
  I take it,\" Kagur said, \"that ghouls generally hole up during the day.\"</p> \n\
  \     <p>Dron grunted.</p> \n     <p>\"Does that mean all your fellows will be resting\
  \ in the same cave where the demon is holding Eovath?\"</p> \n     <p>The ghoul\
  \ hesitated, as though pondering whether he dared lie or might gain any benefit\
  \ from doing so. At length, he said, \"No. Slaves not rest where Master rests. Might\
  \ touch Master's things. Might eat Master's prisoner.\"</p> \n     <p>If that was\
  \ true—and to Kagur's ears, it sounded true—it might be a bit of good fortune. Maybe\
  \ she could at least make her way to Eovath without fighting any more living corpses.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>That was assuming the demon wasn't leading its minions against her at\
  \ this very moment, but she doubted such was the case. The fiend had taken Eovath\
  \ first because it deemed a frost giant the greater prize. At the moment, it probably\
  \ wanted to concentrate on turning him undead, not hunting down the human who remained\
  \ at liberty. It would assume tonight was time enough for that.</p> \n     <p>Scowling,\
  \ Kagur vowed to prove that this time, it was the demon that was underestimating\
  \ its foe.</p> \n     <p>As the morning wore on, she and Dron began to encounter\
  \ the unnatural features that figured in campfire tales of Red Rune Canyon. Patches\
  \ of the walls had turned the hue of blood or obsidian black. In some places, the\
  \ discolorations had cracked open, and bubbling crimson sludge oozed forth like\
  \ pus from infected wounds, stinking of sulfur.</p> \n     <p>At another spot, the\
  \ creek took on a rusty hue, and the vague suggestion of anguished faces formed\
  \ and dissolved in the flow. Glimpsing them made Kagur's skin crawl, yet she felt\
  \ an urge to go on peering, a sense that if she could only make them out clearly,\
  \ she'd learn something she urgently needed to know.</p> \n     <p>But she also\
  \ realized that fascination was irrational and the result of some malign influence.\
  \ She jerked her head up and spotted a pallid something moving partway up the left\
  \ wall.</p> \n     <p>A ghoul perched on a ledge with an outcropping above it for\
  \ shade, an upward jut of stone at the edge of the drop providing cover like a parapet.\
  \ Kagur could only see the top of it, and wouldn't have been able to discern anything\
  \ at all if it hadn't straightened up to blow the curling ram's horn bugle it was\
  \ raising to its lips.</p> \n     <p>She snatched an arrow from her quiver, drew,\
  \ and loosed all in an instant. There was no time to aim properly. Luck was with\
  \ her, though, and the shaft still punched into the ghoul's head. The creature lost\
  \ its grip on the ram's horn and flopped back out of sight. The trumpet fell banging\
  \ and bouncing down the wall.</p> \n     <p>Kagur waited a moment to see if the\
  \ ghoul would reappear. When it didn't, she pivoted and aimed a second arrow at\
  \ Dron's face. Her guide flinched.</p> \n     <p>\"You said,\" Kagur gritted, \"\
  ghouls hide in their lairs when the sun is up. You didn't say there would still\
  \ be lookouts posted along the way.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Not know! New! Watching for\
  \ you!\"</p> \n     <p>Kagur took a breath and let it out slowly. \"Maybe. Anyway,\
  \ you and I are going to keep an eye out for any more of them. You want to spot\
  \ them before they spot us. Because—\"</p> \n     <p>\"If they give signal, you\
  \ kill me!\" Dron snarled. \"Understand!\"</p> \n     <p>As it turned out, they\
  \ didn't come across another sentry. Maybe the one watcher had been a casual afterthought.\
  \ Perhaps the demon assumed the tangled layout of the gorges would be enough to\
  \ keep Kagur wandering lost and confused until nightfall. As it might have, had\
  \ she not pressed a guide into service.</p> \n     <p>The sun had passed its zenith\
  \ when said guide halted and waved his maimed hand at the spot ahead where the gorge\
  \ they were following forked into two. \"Go right. See cave.\"</p> \n     <p>\"\
  We'll see it together.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Master say, 'Kill,' I kill. He say, I do—\
  no matter what.\"</p> \n     <p>Kagur frowned. She was reluctant to dispense with\
  \ Dron's assistance. But she also saw the sense in not taking him any farther if\
  \ the demon could compel him to attack her even against his will. Maimed he might\
  \ be, but he still had fangs and claws.</p> \n     <p>And if it was time to do without\
  \ him, should she kill him? A ghoul was unnatural and the enemy of all that truly\
  \ lived. Every such creature deserved destruction simply for being what it was,\
  \ and even had it been otherwise, now that Dron was crippled, it might actually\
  \ be merciful to grant him a fast and painless death.</p> \n     <p>But she couldn't.\
  \ Blacklions dealt honorably, even with the undead. \"Go, then.\" If it turned out\
  \ he'd led her falsely, it would be easy enough to run him down.</p> \n     <p>She\
  \ waited while Dron hobbled a little way back down the defile. Then she took a long\
  \ breath and laid another arrow on her bow. She crept forward and peered around\
  \ a slimy black- and red-striped outcropping into the right branch of the fork.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>As Dron had promised, a cave mouth opened onto the stones and sand of\
  \ the canyon floor and the creek flowing down the center. Unfortunately, another\
  \ ghoul lookout, the female with the dangling amber necklace, squatted just inside\
  \ the entrance. Squinting, the creature had a hood pulled up to shield its head\
  \ from the sun, but appeared morose and uncomfortable anyway.</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-MagicTable_360.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n      <br> The demon must use the table to help it transform prisoners.\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>Kagur stepped out into the open, drew her arrow to her ear,\
  \ and let it fly. At the same time, the ghoul spotted her and opened its fanged\
  \ mouth to shout.</p> \n     <p>The hurtling arrow plunged into the ghoul's chest.\
  \ Its cry silenced before it began, the living corpse flopped backward and lay motionless.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Kagur peered about to see if the creature's demise had gone undetected.\
  \ Seemingly so. She prowled onward to the opening. There she exchanged her bow for\
  \ her longsword, then skulked into the cave.</p> \n     <p>It wasn't entirely dark\
  \ inside. Not at first, anyway. The daylight coming in the entryway shined for a\
  \ dozen strides before the passage doglegged, and not far beyond that point, greenish\
  \ luminescence flickered from an opening in the left wall.</p> \n     <p>Stalking\
  \ onward, Kagur found the opening led to a side chamber that evidently contained\
  \ the demon's treasures—or at least a sparse but exotic collection of possessions.\
  \ A golden quill scratched letters in red on a parchment that somehow unwound more\
  \ and more of itself without ever reaching an end or making a great pile of used\
  \ paper. In a sluggishly moving painting, a bloody man and woman locked in a carnal\
  \ embrace gnawed off and devoured pieces of one another's flesh. The green light\
  \ danced from an egg-sized gem wreathed in emerald flame and reflected from an oval\
  \ looking glass floating in midair.</p> \n     <p>But there was no sign of Eovath.\
  \ Kagur would have to venture deeper into the cave to find him.</p> \n     <p>She\
  \ took a breath, steeling herself to do so. Then a notion came to her, and she turned\
  \ back to contemplate the mirror anew.</p> \n     <p>Like any proper Kellid, she\
  \ distrusted sorcery even when human beings rather than demons were the casters.\
  \ And a looking glass that hovered in the air was about as plainly enchanted as\
  \ any article could be. There was no telling what touching it might do. Yet if the\
  \ demon tried to use its horrible, debilitating gaze on her again, it might just\
  \ come in handy. </p> \n     <p>Gingerly, she took hold of the mirror's golden frame\
  \ and tugged. It moved it easily. When she tucked it under her arm, it made no effort\
  \ to drift upward or pull away, acting no different from an ordinary object. She\
  \ breathed a sigh of relief. </p> \n     <p>Then Eovath's deep voice bellowed, and\
  \ metal rattled and clashed.</p> \n     <p>Kagur nearly succumbed to the urge to\
  \ race in the direction of the sound. But stealth and caution might still serve\
  \ her brother better, and so she managed to hold herself to a fast stride rather\
  \ than a sprint.</p> \n     <p>The light failed as she stalked deeper, until she\
  \ was groping her way through utter darkness. But fortunately, that was only for\
  \ a few steps. Then she rounded a bend, and a trace of new light tinged the murk\
  \ up ahead.</p> \n     <p>At its end, the passage widened out into another chamber.\
  \ As she crept up to peek inside, metal clattered once again.</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ light in the chamber shined from a scattering of glowing stones and glinted on\
  \ an upright gray metal slab and the coils of chain that bound Eovath against it.\
  \ Projections clasping the sides of his head kept him looking straight forward,\
  \ and little hooks at the ends of thin, bent arms held his golden eyes wide open.\
  \ At the top of the apparatus, a leering molded face sneered out above the giant's\
  \ own.</p> \n     <p>Eovath writhed and struggled against his bonds, producing more\
  \ rattling and clashing, and the chains shifted and tightened like living things\
  \ to hold him in place. The metal face clenched its jaw with effort.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>The bat demon watched until even Eovath, for all his enormous strength and\
  \ endurance, had to leave off straining and catch his breath. Then, its clawed feet\
  \ clicking on the floor, it advanced on him, probably to try again to change him.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Kagur stepped out into the open. \"Stop!\" she snapped.</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ demon hissed and lurched around. Kagur looked straight into its crimson eyes,\
  \ as though she'd learned nothing from their previous encounter, and felt the power\
  \ the Abyssal creature had raised to corrupt Eovath stab at her instead. With a\
  \ surge of triumph, she jerked the looking glass up in front of her face.</p> \n\
  \     <p>Nothing happened.</p> \n     <p>She was still struggling to make sense\
  \ of that fact when clawed hands grabbed the mirror frame and ripped it from her\
  \ grasp. Manifestly unharmed by what she'd imagined to be a masterful ploy, the\
  \ demon spun the mirror behind it and released it to float.</p> \n     <p>\"That's\
  \ mine!\" the creature snarled, and lashed out at her with its claws.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>Kagur dodged aside and whipped out her longsword. When the demon snatched\
  \ for her again, she cut at its scaly forearm.</p> \n     <p>She connected solidly,\
  \ and her blade should have sliced deep and left the limb dangling maimed and useless.\
  \ But as she pulled the weapon back, she saw it had only nicked the demon. The fiend\
  \ laughed at her consternation.</p> \n     <p>Maybe her father had been mistaken.\
  \ Maybe there were some things that could hurt her and which she couldn't hurt back—\
  at least, not enough to matter.</p> \n     <p>No! There had to be a way, and she\
  \ was going to find it.</p> \n     <p>But it was difficult even to think in the\
  \ midst of this combat. The demon was strong and tricky, and pressed her relentlessly.\
  \ In addition to contending with its claw slashes, she had to remember to avoid\
  \ its gaze, and to stay alert for the slithering, thickening sensation that meant\
  \ it was trying to seize hold of her with magic.</p> \n     <p>Even so, she managed\
  \ to wound it two more times. But those gashes were nearly as shallow as the first,\
  \ and they stopped bleeding in a matter of moments.</p> \n     <p>She retreated,\
  \ and her back foot fetched up against a wall. The demon lunged, claws raking downward,\
  \ and she wrenched herself out of the way—but not quite far enough. A sting of pain\
  \ and a spreading wetness told her that the fiend's talons had cut her across the\
  \ shoulder blade.</p> \n     <p>She didn't think the slashes were deep, but couldn't\
  \ stop fighting to check. She could only come back on guard in the increasingly\
  \ forlorn hope of finally cutting deep enough for it to do some good.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>Or perhaps not. She belatedly realized that not all the noise in the cavern\
  \ came from her battle with the demon. Still chained to the table, Eovath was throwing\
  \ himself against his bonds again and again in an effort to break free.</p> \n \
  \    <p>A glance was enough to tell her that his efforts were still unavailing.\
  \ But maybe she could change that. </p> \n     <p>She faked a sidestep to the demon's\
  \ right, then charged forward on its left, the trick carrying her past the fiend's\
  \ talons. It still slapped her with a beat of its wing, but not hard enough to knock\
  \ her off her feet. She raised her sword high, leaped into the air, and cut at the\
  \ face at the top of the restraining rack with all her strength.</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ metal visage split, and the glinting gray mouth screamed. The lengths of chain\
  \ whipped and flailed.</p> \n     <p>At Kagur's back, the demon gave a screeching\
  \ hiss, and she spun around to face it once again.</p> \n     <p>It attacked as\
  \ savagely as before, nearly rending her twice in as many seconds. Then a huge battleaxe\
  \ whirled at its flank. As she'd hoped, hurting the chain-thing had enabled Eovath\
  \ to free himself and recover his weapon, and now he was joining the fight.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The demon dodged, and a blow meant to smash into its torso merely tore\
  \ a wing instead. Worse, Kagur judged that despite her brother's might, the resulting\
  \ rip was smaller than it should have been—like the gashes cut by her sword, they\
  \ somehow weren't enough to truly hurt the demon, and would probably heal in a matter\
  \ of moments. It might be that even she and Eovath fighting together couldn't dispatch\
  \ the demon in their usual fashion.</p> \n     <p>But maybe there was a different\
  \ way to kill it.</p> \n     <p>Kagur waited for a moment when Eovath attacked hard\
  \ and obliged the demon to focus on him. Then she darted to the floating mirror\
  \ and shattered it with her sword. The bat creature pivoted toward the crash and\
  \ screeched at the destruction.</p> \n     <p>\"Run to the other chamber!\" Kagur\
  \ shouted. \"Break everything!\" </p> \n     <p>Without hesitation, Eovath whirled\
  \ and dashed out into the tunnel.</p> \n     <p>Kagur's immediate objective was\
  \ simply to get everybody moving toward the mouth of the cave, and she expected\
  \ the demon to chase Eovath in the normal way. Instead, the creature paused for\
  \ an instant—then vanished.</p> \n     <p>She had a bad feeling about that. As she\
  \ sprinted after Eovath, she called out, \"Don't break things! Just get out!\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>When she passed the entrance to the green-lit treasure room, the demon\
  \ was inside. It had somehow blinked from its former location to its current one,\
  \ and now it goggled at her, surprised that she and the giant were racing right\
  \ on by without even trying to make good on her threat.</p> \n     <p>Eovath lunged\
  \ out into the sunlight, and Kagur scrambled out after him. Then, bursting into\
  \ view as suddenly as it had disappeared previously, the demon was before them,\
  \ crouched and ready.</p> \n     <p>Kagur darted around Eovath and cut the demon\
  \ across the ribs. The giant bellowed and buried his axe in the creature's torso,\
  \ and the bat thing stumbled backward. Judging by appearances, it had finally suffered\
  \ real pain and shock from a wound.</p> \n     <p>\"Into the creek!\" Kagur gasped.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Charging, using the axe still embedded in its body like a handle, the\
  \ giant bulled the demon backward. The creature snatched and scrabbled but failed\
  \ either to deter its foe or detach itself from the weapon before Eovath shoved\
  \ it down into the water.</p> \n     <p>\"Hold its head under!\" Kagur said.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Eovath dropped on top of the demon and wrapped his massive arms around\
  \ it, forcing its face below the surface. Kagur ran up beside the other two combatants\
  \ and, despite the risk of accidentally hitting her brother, stabbed the bat creature\
  \ repeatedly.</p> \n     <p>She no longer had any expectation that the resulting\
  \ wounds would kill it. But the punishment might keep it too distracted to use any\
  \ of its foul magic. And in a simple wrestling match, nothing could beat a frost\
  \ giant.</p> \n     <p>One and two at a time, ghouls started peering from their\
  \ hiding places, from burrows like shallow graves in the sandy ground and shadowy\
  \ depressions in the canyon walls. They might hate the daylight, but the commotion\
  \ had roused them even so. Kagur wracked her brain for a strategy that would allow\
  \ her and Eovath to contend with them and their master at the same time.</p> \n\
  \     <p>But then Eovath wheezed, \"I think we got it.\"</p> \n     <p>He straightened\
  \ up, gripped the demon by the neck, and hoisted it high, displaying it to the ghouls.\
  \ The fiend dangled limply as a rag doll, and its many wounds weren't puckering\
  \ shut anymore.</p> \n     <p>\"You see?\" Eovath croaked to the ghouls. \"The demon's\
  \ dead!\"</p> \n     <p>The ghouls exchanged glances. Then they started retreating\
  \ back into their holes and dark recesses. Maybe they feared to fight folk formidable\
  \ enough to kill their maker. Kagur supposed it was even possible they were grateful\
  \ for their liberation.</p> \n     <p>In any case, their withdrawal allowed her\
  \ to take a closer look at Eovath, and she caught her breath to see how many times\
  \ the demon had clawed him as it struggled to break free. \"Are you all right?\"\
  \ she asked.</p> \n     <p>\"I will be.\" Eovath dumped the demon corpse beside\
  \ the water. \"Thanks to my cunning sister.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Who shouldn't have\
  \ insisted on coming here in the first place. I'm sorry. I'll heed my elders and\
  \ be cautious from here on.\"</p> \n     <p>He grinned. \"Truly?\"</p> \n     <p>She\
  \ felt a smile tugging at her own lips. \"Well, maybe.\"</p> \n     <p><b>Coming\
