  \ \n      <h2>SUPPLY RUN</h2> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Droven could hardly\
  \ believe the twists and turns the last few days had taken. Month after month, season\
  \ after season, he’d traveled the continent of Arcadia, searching for passage back\
  \ to Absalom, an ocean away in the region known as the Inner Sea. He had spent more\
  \ than a few days in the last weeks carefully examining the soles of his metal-reinforced\
  \ boots. Long ago, he’d promised one of the first friends he’d made in Arcadia,\
  \ an old half-orc named Darv, that if he still hadn’t found a way back to Absalom\
  \ by the time the soles of wore thin, he’d return to Darv’s workshop to begin a\
  \ new life.</p> \n      <p>Instead, Droven had inadvertently aided one of his closest\
  \ friends from the Inner Sea, the goblin alchemist Fumbus, in a daring rescue against\
  \ a gang of smugglers, the Wreckers. Fumbus’s rescued friends were a powerful old\
  \ wizard named Ezren, a wise young cleric named Kyra, a cunning elf named Merisiel,\
  \ and a valiant warrior called Valeros.</p> \n      <p>Droven had at first been\
  \ afraid to tell the others they were as stranded as he was, but after some discussion\
  \ the group realized that they had almost everything they needed to make the journey\
  \ back to Absalom. Ezren and Kyra’s magic could calm the worst of the storms and\
  \ turn the currents in their favor, while Valeros’s strength and Merisiel’s cunning,\
  \ combined with Droven’s and Fumbus’s ingenuity, would allow them to build a sturdy\
  \ enough sea craft from the salvage of the Wreckers’ victims. </p> \n      <p>The\
  \ biggest problem was the lack of any known eastward currents bridging the Arcadian\
  \ Ocean to the continents of Avistan and Garund. Droven had heard tales of the legendary\
  \ current carrying Ulfen vikings to Port Valen in northern Arcadia and had even\
  \ seen the maps of the sea routes between Arcadia and Tian Xia, which shared a northern\
  \ land bridge with Avistan. Frustratingly, the northern route was only one way and\
  \ the western route presented unique geographic barriers Droven had never been able\
  \ to surmount. Making the trek in either direction, even accompanied by a group\
  \ of stalwart adventurers, was a fraught journey that would take months at least.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Instead, Droven had a plan that this group’s unique talents were particularly\
  \ suited for. While Valeros and company assembled a ship based on Droven’s blueprints,\
  \ the half-orc, his construct companion Whirp, and Fumbus would venture into the\
  \ abandoned lair of a reckless alchemist in the nearby jungles to retrieve the materials\
  \ necessary to assemble an alchemical engine capable of propelling their craft across\
  \ the Arcadian Ocean, regardless of winds or currents.</p> \n      <p>Droven had\
  \ marked the laboratory the first time he’d passed along this stretch of coast over\
  \ a year ago, though he’d been unwilling to delve too deep after encountering various\
  \ alchemical traps. But now, with the possibility of home so close and a trusted\
  \ companion at his side, Droven felt it worth the risk.</p> \n      <center>\n \
  \      <hr width=\"50%\">\n      </center> \n      <p>“Droven!”</p> \n      <p>“\
  Yes, Fumbus?”</p> \n      <p>“Ice?”</p> \n      <p>“I’m sorry my friend, I’m afraid\
  \ I don’t take your meanin–GAAH!”</p> \n      <p>Droven and Fumbus had bypassed\
  \ a variety of traps and strange monsters to the facility’s primary laboratory.\
  \ Things had been going remarkably well, with inventor, construct, and alchemist\
  \ each uniquely suited to disable the dangers laid by the paranoid alchemist who’\
  d built the place. Droven blamed himself for their current predicament, trapped\
  \ in a sealed room with an angry ooze climbing out of a broken glass tank.</p> \n\
  \      <p>Shaking the sting of an acidic tendril from his non-mechanical arm, Droven\
  \ yelled for Whirp. “Defensive formation zero zero three: barricade!”</p> \n   \
  \   <p>Responding to his maker’s command, Whirp leapt between his allies and the\
  \ approaching ooze, deploying thin, folded metal sheets within his chassis to create\
  \ a temporary barricade. As Droven ducked behind it, Fumbus cleared his throat.</p>\

  \   <p>“Miss you, Droven” Fumbus said, ducking an acidic pseudopod and swirling\
  \ a blue cannister around in his hand. “Ice?”</p> \n      <p>Droven’s good eye widened\
  \ in surprise as he finally realized what the goblin was asking. “Yes, Fumbus! As\
  \ much as you’ve got!”</p> \n      <p>Fumbus hurled the cannister at the ooze, freezing\
  \ a portion of its body but barely slowing its advance. As Droven fired a crossbow\
  \ bolt into the ooze’s mass only to watch it dissolve, he realized Fumbus’s concoctions\
  \ might be their only salvation. “More ice, Fumbus, quickly!”</p> \n      <p>Fumbus’\
  s right hand snatched an empty glass vial from one of his pouches while his left\
  \ darted from his tiled necklace to his pouches, and up… into his mouth. Furiously\
  \ chewing each component before spewing the macerated remains into his vial, Fumbus\
  \ quickly created a second vial of liquid ice and launched it at the encroaching\
  \ ooze before repeating the process.</p> \n      <p>Droven took careful aim at a\
  \ frozen section of ooze before firing his crossbow. As the icy chunk shattered\
  \ into pieces, Droven was relieved to see that the ooze seemed to shrink, its regeneration\
  \ stymied by the freezing cold. As Fumbus threw yet another liquid ice bomb, Droven\
  \ glanced at his friend and suppressed a worried frown. Fumbus smiled at Droven,\
  \ but the goblin’s saliva was frozen to his chin in icicles of drool, and his green\
  \ skin had taken on a distinctly bluish hue. Worse, the goblin’s teeth chattered\
  \ furiously, slowing down the liquid ice process. Seeing Fumbus’s predicament, Droven\
  \ quickly removed a few mechanical components from his backpack. He’d been working\
  \ on something the local Arcadians called a “cryomister,” a device intended to release\
  \ a controlled stream of freezing liquid. Droven had been struggling to complete\
  \ it due to his lack of familiarity with Arcadian alchemy, but Fumbus possessed\
  \ exactly what Droven lacked.</p> \n      <p>“Fumbus! Pour everything you’ve got\
  \ into this!”</p> \n      <p>Fumbus snatched up the proffered device and spewed\
  \ all the components in his mouth directly into its ammunition cartridge. Trying\
  \ hard not to think about what had just happened, Droven took the device back, activated\
  \ it, and tossed it at the broken glass tank from which the ooze poured. As the\
  \ cryomister sank into the acidic flow, chilling fog poured forth, solidifying the\
  \ ooze until only a blue-green statue remained.</p> \n      <p>Wiping shards of\
  \ frozen drool from his chin, Fumbus wasted no time in sacking the lab, quickly\
  \ identifying a variety of ingredients and reagents capable of fueling the alchemical\
  \ engine Droven intended to build. Struggling to his feet, Droven leaned on Whirp’\
  s body. His good arm was burned by acid, and he felt the weight of his prosthetic\
  \ limb keenly as he struggled to stand. The two friends and friendly construct quickly\
  \ gathered the materials they would need to assemble their engine.</p> \n      <p>“\
  Droven?”</p> \n      <p>“Yes, Fumbus?”</p> \n      <p>“Oozes terrible.”</p> \n \
  \     <p>“Yeah, Fumbus. They’re pretty bad.”</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p\
