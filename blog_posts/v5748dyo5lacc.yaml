  \ a Pro: Question Four</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Monday, June 8, 2009</p> \n\
  \    <p><i>4. You have been playing a campaign for many months, and your group suffers\
  \ a TPK. Do you fudge the rolls, contrive a reason for them to be brought back,\
  \ have them create new characters and pick up where the others left off, or just\
  \ scrap the campaign?</i></p> \n    <p><b>Lisa Stevens</b>: I've never had a TPK;\
  \ it's been close! (laughs) I'm a big believer in creating and building a campaign\
  \ over time. I've had key NPCs die and had to completely reinvent the story, but\
  \ I don't think I'd ever allow the PCs to get to the point where they are faced\
  \ with a TPK. It would ruin the story, and it would ruin my fun as the GM. I mean,\
  \ it would be like watching a season of CSI and halfway through they replaced all\
  \ of the characters and actors and never resolved any of the plot threads.</p> \n\
  \    <p><b>F. Wesley Schneider</b>: Yes, I usually try to save them. I mean, if\
  \ it's just one or two characters that die, then that's fine, you can pick up your\
  \ new character at the next town or dungeon. But if it's the entire group, then\
  \ yeah, I usually contrive some way for them to keep going. I mean, I've fudged\
  \ dice, I've had them maybe captured instead of killed, and so on.</p> \n    <p><b>James\
  \ Jacobs</b>: Every time I've had a TPK, that's been the end of the campaign. Start\
  \ over.</p> \n    <p><b>Erik Mona</b>: Depends. If... Well, it just depends.</p>\
  \ \n    <p><b>Jason Bulmahn</b>: Sometimes I'll fudge but I try to gauge the group\
  \ and see if they're interested in continuing. Sometimes I'll start a new group\
  \ and tackle the same storyline from a different perspective. Like for example let's\
  \ say they're all soldiers under a warlord and they all decide that he's evil and\
  \ turn against him but are all TPKed, well the next batch of characters they make\
  \ might be a bunch of villagers whose village was destroyed by the same warlord.</p>\
  \ \n    <p><b>Sean K Reynolds</b>: What I would probably do is have everyone create\
  \ secondary characters where it is their sole purpose to rescue the other group.\
  \ That way the players are <i>still</i> responsible for saving themselves.</p> \n\
  \    <p><b>Joshua J. Frost</b>: If everyone dies, it's over. A chance to start something\
  \ new.</p> \n    <p><b>James Sutter</b>: If it's my fault, I'm not against saying,\
  \ \"My bad,\" and resetting the encounter. But in general, this doesn't happen.\
  \ I do believe that character death is one of the most important parts of the game.\
  \ Even as a player, having a character die in a very dramatic way adds so much to\
  \ the experience. In fact, I've had campaigns where one of my PCs would get killed,\
  \ then create a new character, and for the next several sessions the plot would\
  \ revolve around their quest for revenge.</p> \n    <p><b>Chris Self</b>: I'll actually\
  \ roll back the last combat and let them retry. I'm the type of GM who pulls punches\
  \ if necessary. I see roleplaying games as more of a cooperative storytelling, and\
  \ TPKs are just no fun.</p> \n    <p><i>I've never had a TPK in any game I've ran,\
  \ more's the pity, but I think I would probably figure out a way to continue the\
  \ campaign if my players were really, really keen on continuing.</i></p> \n    <p>Hank\
