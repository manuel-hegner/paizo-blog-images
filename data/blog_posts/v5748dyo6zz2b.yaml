  ></a>\n     </div>\n     <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Ulka knew\
  \ the warmth of family for less than an hour. Her first cries were a wail of grief\
  \ for her parents, slaughtered alongside the rest of her hold in a brutal raid by\
  \ rival orcs. The murderers left the orphaned child untouched among the corpses,\
  \ prey for wolves or the elements to take, chortling and sporting among each other\
  \ for their cruelty. Empty Hand scouts found the babe not long after, screaming\
  \ in defiance at the heavens, as if daring the gods themselves to answer for their\
  \ sins.</p>\n      <p>The Empty Hand had come to recruit Ulka's people to the banner\
  \ of their leader, Grask Uldeth. A tiny bundle swaddled in boar skin was not the\
  \ prize they sought, but they obeyed their orders all the same. Ulka grew up a sullen\
  \ child in Urgir, troubled and quiet except for outbursts of unprovoked ferocity.\
  \ Far from considering this inappropriate, the orcs who raised Ulka were impressed\
  \ by her ferocity, encouraging her to turn her anger into a blade upon the battlefield.\
  \ Ulka resented them all for this, loathing those who saw her pain as an opportunistic\
  \ tool. Of course, this bitterness only made her tutors and caretakers prouder.</p>\n\
  \      <p>Ulka does not remember how she fell in with Grask’s second-in-command,\
  \ Ardax the White-Hair. All she recalls is that Ardax had little interest in her\
  \ temper or even her prowess in combat. Instead, Ardax would ask her questions she\
  \ didn't have the answer to or challenge her to seemingly simple games that were\
  \ far more complex than they first appeared. While this led to quite a few tantrums\
  \ from young Ulka, she appreciated these mental challenges far more than any other\
  \ lessons the Empty Hand inflicted on her.</p>\n      <p>She was eventually adopted\
  \ and raised by Ardax’s militant enforcers, the Closed Fist. This upbringing focused\
  \ on developing her martial prowess, with Ardax personally seeing to her instruction\
  \ in lessons of strategy and leadership. Ulka excelled in all categories, though\
  \ she could never quite match the older man’s uncanny prescience. Even now, though\
  \ Ulka scoffs at the thought of fate or prophecy, she wonders if Ardax sought her\
  \ out because he sensed something about her. For a while, she even dared to believe\
  \ she had found her place with him, her future.</p>\n      <p>Perhaps Ulka might\
  \ have one day commanded her own orc hold. Yet once again, death came to call upon\
  \ her. Once again, it strode past her without a nod and took everything away from\
  \ her.</p>\n      <br clear=\"all\">\n      <table class=\"image\" align=\"left\"\

  \      </table>\n      <br>\n      <p>It came on an evening like any other, when\
  \ Ulka was standing watch. As the moon hung high overhead, she began to feel a nagging\
  \ doubt in the back of her mind, so she checked on Grask Uldeth to discover the\
  \ warlord dead. His body was left on his throne, impaled on multiple swords. Guarding\
  \ was meant to have been a simple task, and yet she had seen nothing, heard nothing.\
  \ Such supreme failure, even if the assassination had been the result of powerful\
  \ magic, would lead to only the direst of consequences for her.</p>\n      <p>Ulka\
  \ knew her limits. She had no chance of unraveling the truth in her current position,\
  \ with her current skills and knowledge. Rather than let herself be used as a pawn,\
  \ to let others make her pain into another tool, she chose to flee Urgir. Ulka would\
  \ gather allies, finding plenty of orcs and others who were as cast aside and wronged\
  \ by the world as she was. She would build her power until an opportunity to avenge\
  \ Grask and reclaim her reputation presented itself.</p>\n      <p>Mercenary work\
  \ sustained her. It was plenty, and it was Hell. Together, she and her followers\
  \ clawed a living from troughs of bloody ground. Despite her stern orders and brutal\
  \ punishments, her efforts left too many orphans, yowling babes left to lament the\
  \ world's cruelty just as she had. Ulka refused to let her rage consume her, as\
  \ the Empty Hand had urged her in her youth, but she felt whatever passed as her\
  \ soul grew scabs and scars. Her commands became louder, more demanding, more vicious.\
  \ Her troops gave her the surname Oathshriek for her battle cry, which promised\
  \ violence to her enemies and even greater violence to her gods should she fall\
  \ in battle.</p>\n      <p>Death came to her again, this time laden with rewards.\
  \ While orcs could face prejudice among the people of the Inner Sea, many were happy\
  \ to hire orc mercenaries to slay their foes. Ulka proved herself over and over,\
  \ earning renown with Nirmathi irregulars, Druman Blackjackets, Isgeri border patrols,\
  \ and even Andoren Eagle Knights. Her victories soon preceded her, presenting new\
  \ opportunities with prestigious mercenary groups and local militaries alike. Money\
  \ flowed into her pockets, and bright young soldiers flocked to her flag. She sent\
  \ them into combat to their deaths, and they cheered her for it.</p>\n      <p>Gorum's\
  \ death brought further riches and ruin. Ulka is in high demand, able to pick and\
  \ choose her jobs as she likes. She knows she could even ride back into Urgir if\
  \ she wanted, to be welcomed back with open arms. Yet why should she? Nothing different\
  \ awaits her there, only more bloody battles as Belkzen fights with Tar-Baphon and\
  \ traitorous holds of orcs. More and more, Ulka knows the only home for her is among\
  \ the bones and ashes. The fighting blackens her soul, but to lay down her arms\
  \ would be cowardice. To refuse to fight for the helpless, to let others be slaughtered\
  \ like her family, would be immoral. And to find peace, to find a home, is impossible.\
  \ Nowhere in the world escapes the specter of war. Nowhere in the world is far enough\
  \ to run.</p>\n      <p>Ulka fights, surviving when others fall, waiting for the\
  \ day a foe finally strikes true and pierces her heart. She waits for the day she\
  \ can finally spit her dying breath at Pharasma's feet.</p>\n      <p style=\"margin-left:\
