  date\">Wednesday, December 29, 2010</p> \n   <p>Like it or not, it's the time of\
  \ the year when we reflect on the past and make plans for the future. Often this\
  \ means resolutions. Sure, there are the typical resolutions. You promise yourself\
  \ to avoid the temptations of gaming snacks (yeah, right!), exercise more (break\
  \ out that Wii or Kinect), and quit your favorite nasty habit (yet again). But what\
  \ about gaming resolutions? Have you thought about any of those yet? Well, to get\
  \ you in the mindset, here are a few from around the office.</p>\n   <p> </p>\n\
  \   <p>Game more! An impromptu poll around the office showed this was the most popular\
  \ gaming resolution at Paizo. While we're surrounded by games every day, and some\
  \ of us play in more games than our families might like, we're always hungry for\
  \ more.</p> \n   <p>Mark Moreland wants to play more systems in the New Year, and\
  \ he is not alone. That's always a goal here. If you couldn't tell, we all have\
  \ a geekish curiosity about games in general, especially RPGs, and are always willing\
  \ to play whatever game a brave and patient GM is willing to run.</p> \n   <p>As\
  \ for running games, there are many of us who are looking to start new campaigns\
  \ in 2011. Hyrum Savage wants to get his \"The Dregs\" campaign off the ground.\
  \ It's something he brainstormed with Owen Stephens a couple of months ago. The\
  \ premise is that everyone in the group was kicked out of their former adventuring\
  \ group for being, well... not very good at adventuring. That's right, we're all\
  \ going to playing the scrubs. Abilities are generated with 3d6s going straight\
  \ down the line on the character sheet. I've already rolled up my stats: Str 11,\
  \ Dex 7, Con 12, Int 10, Wis 8, Cha 6. While I don't expect my fighter—Muckle the\
  \ Chucklehead—to live very long, I do expect the game will feature much telling\
  \ of bad jokes and laughter, not necessarily in that order.</p> \n   <p>I'm trying\
  \ to finagle my way into running a Curse of the Crimson Throne campaign. I know\
  \ this will come into conflict with my wife's resolution of not have me run another\
  \ campaign, but I've already started collecting miniatures for this game, so that's\
  \ bad news for her.</p> \n   <p>Almost all of us are looking to be more productive\
  \ in our geekery come 2011. Crystal Frasier is looking to release more Pathfinder\
  \ and Mutants &amp; Masterminds PDFs, and many of us want to get ahead on our multitude\
  \ of projects, both at work and on the side. Everyone in the Tuesday minis-painting\
  \ crew is hatching grand plans for next year's painting. I'm sure that group's ranks\
  \ will swell at the start of 2011 when folks who are sorely behind on their minis\
  \ painting (Bulmahn!) will make the effort to turn over a new leaf in the New Year.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Some of our resolutions are just downright odd. One of James Sutter's\
  \ resolutions is to continue to spend James Jacobs's Sandpoint games yelling things\
  \ like \"BLOOD FOR THE BIRD GOD!\" and \"THE DARK LORD COMES!\" every time his character,\
  \ Kirin, sees a seagull. That and the well-meaning (but maybe futile) goal of not\
  \ being the flakiest person in whatever game he's playing. Good luck with that,\
  \ Sutter!</p> \n   <p>What about you? What gaming resolutions do you have for the\
  \ New Year? <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lbqq#discuss\">Talk back at us on the\
  \ Paizo messageboards</a> and don't get upset if we end up stealing some of your\
  \ resolutions as our own.</p> \n   <p>Stephen Radney-MacFarland <br>Pathfinder RPG\
