| summary  = Halcyon Speaker Dedication, Feat 6. Uncommon, Archetype, Dedication. Prerequisites: Magaambyan Attendant Dedication, member of the Magaambya of conversant rank. You devote much of your study to halcyon magic. You gain access to two common Halcyon cantrips and two common 1st-level halcyon spells. In addition to being able to cast your halcyon spells via your arcane or primal spell slots, you also gain a 1st-level halcyon spell slot. You can use your halcyon spell slots to spontaneously cast your halcyon spells. Special: You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the halcyon speaker archetype. Halcyon magic has been practiced by the Magaambya for a long time, but the researchers and staff at the university arenâ€™t content to rest on their laurels. The Magaambya has plenty of teachers to pass down their current traditions, but also continue researching ways that other traditions of magic might be combined: arcane magic pulsing with the power of the divine, or occult secrets locked away in ancient, primal monuments.
