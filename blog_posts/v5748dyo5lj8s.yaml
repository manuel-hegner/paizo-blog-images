  > \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">We're just a few short weeks away from the November\
  \ 23rd official release date for <a href=\"/products/btpy9kcu\"><em>Deadly Foes</em></a>,\
  \ the newest release in our prepainted plastic <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder\
  \ Battles</a> line from our partners at WizKids! As I write this, the Paizo warehouse\
  \ elves (almost certainly drow) are unpacking minis to be sold as singles, prepping\
  \ case subscriber orders, and overall getting our act together to release everything\
  \ on time. Meanwhile, I've been sneaking in and stealing figures left and right.\
  \ What value is there in absolute power if you don't allow it to absolutely corrupt\
  \ you, at least a little bit?</p> \n    <p>I'm VERY pleased with how <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9kcu\"><em>Deadly Foes</em></a> turned out, and think it's one of\
  \ our best sets yet. From great facial details to amazing \"tampo\" stamping of\
  \ intricate designs (mostly pentagrams), <a href=\"/products/btpy9kcu\"><em>Deadly\
  \ Foes</em></a> will soon prove to be just as popular outside the Paizo office as\
  \ it is inside.</p> \n    <p>Because you never quite know how these sets are going\
  \ to turn out until you see final production figures, earlier this afternoon I grabbed\
  \ two handfuls of my favorite figures from <a href=\"/products/btpy9kcu\"><em>Deadly\
  \ Foes</em></a> and ventured outside to take advantage of some rare November sunshine\
  \ here in Seattle. This gave me the chance for some \"candid\" photos of the final\
  \ production figures that I'd like to share with you today.</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20161104-Photo1_360.jpeg\"></a>\n \
  \   </div> \n    <p>Here we have the mighty Barzillai Thrune (rare), arch-villain\
  \ of the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/hellsRebels\">Hell's Rebels Adventure\
  \ Path</a>, leading a horrific ceremony to summon a devil from the depths of Hell.\
  \ With him, from left to right, are the Fire Diabolist (rare), the Priest of Asmodeus\
  \ (common), and the Thrune Enforcer (common). In the background we see examples\
  \ of the set's ultra-rare dungeon dressing pieces, which come 1-2 per case. Here\
  \ we have two candelabras, the Book of the Damned (which comes off its lectern),\
  \ and the Hellgate.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20161104-Photo2.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Great success! All hail mighty Asmodeus as a Bearded\
  \ Devil (uncommon) emerges from the Hellgate! What a joyous occasion for the forces\
  \ of evil! But wait, what's that dark shadow in the flames of the gate? Is something\
  \ else coming? Perhaps more than the diabolists bargained for?</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Oh nooooo! It's an almighty Pit Devil (rare)! Even the\
  \ evil servants of the diabolical House Thrune are on the run after the appearance\
  \ of this unwelcome guest! Run awaaaaay!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n\

  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Speaking of the Pit Devil, here he is standing next to\
  \ the <a href=\"/products/btpy92k6\">Fire Demon</a> from <a href=\"/products/btpy909j\"\
  ><em>Legends of Golarion</em></a>, by way of a size comparison. Demon? Devil? YOU\
  \ decide!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20161104-Photo5.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Here's a close look at some of the dungeon dressing in\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9kcu\"><em>Deadly Foes</em></a>. The Hellgate looks much\
  \ better to my eyes in hand than on the digital image, since you can make out the\
  \ writhing bodies of its frame much more easily. And take it from me, they're pretty\
  \ disturbing. These pieces make for great d√©cor in almost any frightful scene, and\
  \ I'm eager to add them to my own campaigns.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Hobgoblins are a major creature type in <a href=\"/products/btpy9kcu\"\
  ><em>Deadly Foes</em></a>. Here are a few of them (from left to right): the Hobgoblin\
  \ Archer, Hobgoblin Cleric, and Hobgoblin Alchemist, all of them commons.</p> \n\

  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>We've been adding characters from the villainous nation\
  \ of Cheliax to our \n     <link>Pathfinder Battles sets for years, and this set\
  \ is no exception. Some day soon I'll array all of these figures for a class photo,\
  \ but here are four from <a href=\"/products/btpy9kcu\"><em>Deadly Foes</em></a>:\
  \ the Thrune Enforcer, Priest of Asmodeus, Fire Diabolist, and Barzillai Thrune!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>And that's it for this week. Next week I'll show off more <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9kcu\"><em>Deadly Foes</em></a> figures \"in the wild.\" Let me know\
  \ if there are others from the set you'd like to take a closer look at, and I'll\
  \ do my best to accommodate.</p> \n    <p>Until then, I remain...</p> \n    <p>Erik\
