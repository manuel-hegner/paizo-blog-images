  \ itemprop=\"headline\">Meet the Iconics: Harsk</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Tuesday,\
  \ November 20, 2007</p> \n    <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n     <p>Not all dwarves\
  \ are meant for the mines. As a young dwarf, Harsk spent every spare moment outdoors\
  \ under the wide skies of southeastern Varisia, particularly at night beneath the\
  \ stars, where his keen vision made him a hunter without compare. While generally\
  \ uninterested in his family's traditional smithing, he still inherited enough of\
  \ their tinkering ability to construct his own crossbow, a heavy, highly accurate\
  \ weapon that few others are able to wind. Eschewing the company of his fellows,\
  \ few things made Harsk happier than crouching in a tree stand with his bow, listening\
  \ to the wind through the forest leaves and waiting for deer or larger prey to wander\
  \ by.</p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \n     <p>That all changed twenty\
  \ years ago, when his elder brother, a fine captain named Sigur, led a dwarven war\
  \ band from Janderhoff against a small party of giants that had descended from the\
  \ Mindspin Mountains to raid and pillage. Out of affection, Sigur offered his less-experienced\
  \ sibling the chance to come and prove himself as Sigur's chief scout and second-in-command.\
  \ Calm and peaceful by nature, Harsk turned him down, failing to see the honor his\
  \ brother was doing him until several days after the company had departed. Traveling\
  \ light and fast, Harsk caught up with his brother quicklyâ€”but not quickly enough.\
  \ Misjudging the size and skill of the raiding party, Sigur led his band into an\
  \ ambush, where it was slaughtered to the last dwarf. </p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\
  \ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \n     <p>With his brother's blood still fresh on his hands,\
  \ Harsk went mad with rage. That night, he stalked through the giants' camp like\
  \ a vengeful wraith, slaughtering giant after giant with his crossbow before melting\
  \ back into the forest, only to reappear elsewhere and take another victim. When\
  \ the last giant was left gurgling in the dust, Harsk took up his brother's axe\
  \ and slipped off into the trees, vowing to forever be the voice of justice in the\
  \ wild places, to keep balance and prevent the sacrifices of noble men like his\
  \ brother. </p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \n     <p>Harsk, like\
  \ many of his kind, is gruff and taciturn, but there ends most of his connection\
  \ to dwarven society. Something of a loner, he prefers to spend his time outdoors,\
  \ communing with nature, though he occasionally travels alongside others whose goals\
  \ match his own. Uninterested in the beer and ale that so characterize dwarves in\
  \ the minds of human society, Harsk instead drinks pot after pot of strong tea to\
  \ keep his senses sharp. While he never lets his brother's axe out of his sight,\
  \ he wields it only as a last resort, knowing that his true skills lie in the hunt\
  \ and striking from darkness. </p> \n     <p>James Sutter <br>Assistant Editor,\
