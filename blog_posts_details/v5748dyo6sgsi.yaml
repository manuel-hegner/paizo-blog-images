  alt: "A glimpse of the Saga Lands. The city seems to be hewn of stone, with two\
    \ fantastically gigantic statues guarding each side of this entrance. Each statue\
    \ depicts a person holding a long, thin staff in one hand, the top of which has\
    \ a kink in it. The other hand holds a large tablet close to the chest of the\
    \ statue. They are mirror images of each other."

    \ mask, a plume of red hair flowing from the back. Her cape is almost the same\
    \ color as her hair. She wields a long sword in her right hand."
