  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Thursday, September 9, 2010</p> \n   <p>As of this past\
  \ Gen Con, Pathfinder Society Organized Play has officially entered its third year\
  \ with the launch of Season 2. In addition to the 28 new scenarios players can expect\
  \ over the next year, Season 2 presents a new aspect of organized play that members\
  \ of our online community have been very vocal about wanting since the very beginning:\

  \  </table> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>Approximately half of the season's scenarios\
  \ will center around the Shadow Lodge, a mysterious organization set on destroying\
  \ the Pathfinder Society from within. These scenarios, as with most, can be played\
  \ in any order, but frequent PFS players will notice a lot of easter eggs between\
  \ adventures. There are already several scenarios available to kick off the plot\
  \ arc, but the biggest release of the season is one you won't see on the downloads\
  \ page.</p> \n   <p><i>Year of the Shadow Lodge</i> is an exclusive Pathfinder Society\
  \ Special by fan-favorite author Tim Hitchcock, designed to be run at any game store\
  \ or convention with at least three simultaneous tables of PFS. Spanning levels\
  \ 1â€“11, this scenario allows both new and seasoned players to take part in an epic\
  \ adventure to save the Grand Lodge itself! <i>Year of the Shadow Lodge</i> played\
  \ to rave reviews at both PaizoCon and Gen Con (at which 36 tables played simultaneously!),\
  \ and you can run it at your own event to the same response.</p> \n   <p>If you\
  \ run a local convention or organize Pathfinder Society at a game store (or if you\
  \ know the person who does), contact <a href=\"mailto:pathfindersociety@paizo.com?subject=Year\
  \ of the Shadow Lodge\">pathfindersociety@paizo.com</a> to find out how to get your\
  \ hands on this exclusive event! It won't be available for purchase on the paizo.com\
  \ web store until next summer when Season 3 begins, so launch Season 2 in style\
  \ with a memorable gaming experience only authorized events can offer.</p> \n  \
