  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Happy holidays, one and\
  \ all! Whether you're celebrating the season, stuck working, or enjoying business\
  \ mandated days off, I don't think it's an exaggeration to say we could all use\
  \ a bit of festive cheer this year. Winter traditions range from the sweet to the\
  \ downright malevolent (check out Krampus in our upcoming <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq024xj?Pathfinder-Bestiary-3\"\
  ><em>Bestiary 3</em></a>), but by far one of the strangest is the Welsh tradition\
  \ of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mari_Lwyd\" target=\"_blank\">Mari\
  \ Lwyd</a>. This spooky, shrouded creature has a horse's skull for a head. It shows\
  \ up either during Christmas or the New Year—depending on how much the local church\
  \ freaks out about its presence—and carols at the doorways to peoples' houses, <a\
  \ href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_xFo6Hifzk&amp;feature=emb_logo\" target=\"\
  _blank\">demanding entrance using Welsh rhymes</a>. Those who let the Mari Lwyd\
  \ inside must offer the creature hospitality, usually in the form of alcohol and\
  \ cheese. (Golarion scholars are still debating the absolute definition of “cheese”\
  , but the general rule is that if you have to ask if something counts, it doesn't.)</p>\

  \ target=\"_blank\">Wikipedia</a></p>\n     </div> \n     <p>Of course, most people\
  \ don't want to give up their holiday booze and cheese to a creepy skull-horse!\
  \ Those who seek to deny the Mari Lwyd entrance must sing back, telling it to leave.\
  \ The festive Welsh rap battle, known as Pwnco, continues until one party runs out\
  \ of ideas and is defeated. Should the Mari Lwyd lose, it will be on its way. If\
  \ it wins, the household invites it in, but only—most critically—after the occupants\
  \ make it promise to behave. Otherwise, the creature parties <em>too</em> hard,\
  \ wrecking the place in a joyous frenzy. </p> \n     <p>Many Pathfinder monsters\
  \ are wicked or hostile, but the Mari Lwyd is simply out to enjoy the season. Are\
  \ your characters and players up to challenge this frightening being to a contest\
  \ of rhymes? Or would they throw a Kraft Single at it and hope it goes away? </p>\
  \ \n     <h3>Mari Lwyd — Creature 11</h3> \n     <p><b>Uncommon, CN, Large, Fey</b></p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>Perception</b> +21; darkvision<br> <b>Languages</b> Common, Sylvan<br>\
  \ <b>Skills</b> Athletics +23, Diplomacy +19, Intimidation +21, Performance +21,\
  \ Thievery +20<br> <b>Str</b> +7, <b>Dex</b> +3, <b>Con</b> +5, <b>Int</b> +4, <b>Wis</b>\
  \ +2, <b>Cha</b> +6<br> <b>AC</b> 30; <b>Fort</b> +24, <b>Ref</b> +21, <b>Will</b>\
  \ +18<br> <b>HP</b> 190; Immunities persistent wassailing</p> \n     <p><b>Mostly\
  \ Harmless</b> The Mari Lwyd is out simply to enjoy the season. The Mari Lwyd's\
  \ attacks have the nonlethal trait when attacking creatures, unless those creatures\
  \ attempt a hostile action on the Mari Lwyd first.</p> \n     <p><b>Persistent Wassailing</b>\
  \ The Mari Lwyd cannot be disrupted by common means. It always knows if a building\
  \ is truly unoccupied or if the occupants can speak and hear and are merely refusing\
  \ to sing back, and it is immune to silence and similar effects of up to 5th level.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>Speed</b> 50 feet, swim 30 feet</p> \n     <p><b>Melee</b> [one-action]\
  \ jaws +24 (magical, reach 10 feet), <b>Damage</b> 3d10+10 piercing</p> \n     <p><b>Melee</b>\
  \ [one-action] hoof +24 (agile, magical, reach 10 feet), <b>Damage</b> 3d8+10 bludgeoning</p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>Pwnco</b> [three-actions] The Mari Lwyd begins a rhyming contest,\
  \ requesting entrance to a closed home, tavern, or other building that has occupants\
  \ who can respond in it. It rolls a Performance check. Before the Mari Lwyd's next\
  \ turn, one occupant must respond to the Mari Lwyd’s request by spending three actions\
  \ to Perform a song of their own. The DC for the respondent’s song is equal to the\
  \ result of the Mari Lwyd’s Performance check. If the building is occupied and no\
  \ one responds, this has the effects of a critical failure.</p> \n     <p><b>Critical\
  \ Success</b> The respondents win the Pwnco, causing the Mari Lwyd to depart.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>Success</b> The response is good, and the Pwnco continues. The Mari\
  \ Lwyd must use Pwnco again on its next turn. It takes a –2 circumstance penalty\
  \ to its Performance check or increases its current circumstance penalty by 2, whichever\
  \ is worse.</p> \n     <p><b>Failure</b> The respondents lose the Pwnco! The Mari\
  \ Lwyd demands hospitality, causing the door to unlock and open and any barriers\
  \ at the door to move out of the way. If the door is magically sealed, the Mari\
  \ Lwyd attempts to counteract the effect (counteract level 11, counteract modifier\
  \ +22). If no occupant of the building offers the Mari Lwyd alcohol or cheese before\
  \ the start of its next turn and demands that it behave itself, the Mari Lwyd can\
  \ use Festive Rampage at the start of its next turn.</p> \n     <p><b>Critical Failure</b>\
  \ As failure, but due to the ineptitude of the response, the Mari Lwyd counteracts\
  \ magical effects with a counteract level of 15 and modifier of +30, and it must\
  \ be offered twice as much alcohol or cheese.</p> \n     <p><b>Festive Rampage</b>\
  \ [free-action] <b>Requirements</b> The Mari Lwyd enters a building after winning\
  \ the Pwnco, and was not both told to behave itself and offered alcohol or cheese;\
  \ <b>Effect</b> The Mari Lwyd flies into a destructive celebratory rampage. As long\
  \ as the Mari Lwyd remains in the building, it gains resistance 10 to all damage\
  \ and its strikes ignore 10 Hardness. The Mari Lwyd loses the benefits of this ability\
  \ if it attacks a living creature, and typically smashes furniture instead.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>To every one of you, all the best.</p> \n     <p style=\"margin-left:\
