  \ is 100% Colombian coffee which Geek Grind Coffee Company harvests in the mountains,\
  \ sun-dried and roasted to perfection. The taste notes are ripe red fruits, green\
  \ apple, and vanilla, with medium body, low acidity. The caffeine content is somewhat\
  \ higher than average for a 100% Colombian. It is smooth, delicious, and perfect\
  \ for breakfast or after dinner via drip or french press. It is also outstanding\
  \ for espresso shots. The coffee is whole bean so you can grind as needed, according\
  \ to your use and brew style.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a\

  \ today for Geek Grind Coffee as it was when they started more than 40 years ago.</p>\
