  \ \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Lemme tell you why <a href=\"/products/btq01ws8?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Curse-of-the-Crimson-Throne-Adventure-Path\"\
  ><em>Curse of the Crimson Throne</em></a> is my favorite Pathfinder Adventure Card\
  \ Game set yet. It's totally self-indulgent. You've been warned.</p> \n    <p>Back\
  \ in 2007, I was helping Vic and Lisa launch the board game line that included Kill\
  \ Doctor Lucky, Stonehenge, and (my personal favorite) <a href=\"/products/btpy9r43?Yetisburg-Titanic-Battles-in-History-Volume-1\"\
  ><em>Yetisburg</em></a>. I got to be around Jason Bulmahn, James Jacobs, James Sutter,\
  \ Wes Schneider, and the rest of the original Pathfinder RPG design team. One day,\
  \ Wes came to me with a query.</p> \n    <p>\"Mike, do you know how to design a\
  \ tarot deck?\" Wes said.</p> \n    <p>In fact, I had waited years for someone to\
  \ ask me that question. In those days, I owned over a dozen tarot decks, and I had\
  \ long wanted to make a divination deck that could stand up next to Ravenloft's\
  \ tarokka, Discworld's caroc, and Everway. I'd just never had the chance.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Wes told me that the new RPG Adventure Path they were planning, Curse of\
  \ the Crimson Throne, would feature a storyteller deck, but nobody in the company\
  \ knew what to call it or how it could work. Or even how many cards it had.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Fifty-four,\" I said. \"The nine alignments times the six abilities.\
  \ Done.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Uh,\" said Wes. \"Yeah, you're designing our tarot deck.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>So we began work on what I dubbed \"<a href=\"/products/btpy8yt3?Pathfinder-Chronicles-Harrow-Deck\"\
  >The Harrow Deck</a>.\"</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/products/btpy8yt3?Pathfinder-Chronicles-Harrow-Deck\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/product/catalog/PZO/PZO9200_360.jpeg\"></a> \n\
  \     <p>The original Harrow packaging, designed by James Davis with art by Kyle\
  \ Hunter.</p>\n    </div> \n    <p>Now, this wasn't one of these everyone-in-the-world-figure-out-this-thing\
  \ projects. It was too niche of a design for that. Instead, Wes, the Jameses, artist\
  \ Kyle Stanley Hunter, and I just holed up and riffed for a couple of hours.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"What if there was a giant, but he was juggling?\" Wes would say.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Juggling an elephant?\" Kyle would reply.</p> \n    <p>\"And a unicorn,\"\
  \ Sutter would answer. \"Not juggling a unicorn. A different card with a unicorn.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"But with a pear on the end of her horn, and she can't get it off,\"\
  \ I'd say.</p> \n    <p>\"I have an odd idea for The Marriage,\" Jacobs would say,\
  \ and we'd keep going till it was done.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a\

  ></a> \n     <p>I'm sure we were sober when we thought of these.</p>\n    </div>\
  \ \n    <p>I had the mechanics worked out from the get-go, tasking Kyle with envisioning\
  \ six symbols we could float over the art in nine different alignment positions.\
  \ But, we needed more heft to this thing. We brought in my design partner Teeuwynn\
  \ Woodruff to create a divination mechanic and to write dozens of fascinating interpretations\
  \ of the nutball ideas we had come up with. Jason brought over an idea for a gambling\
  \ game called Towers based on my card alignment array. Mike McArtor (we miss ya,\
  \ bud) took on the editing and James Davis the graphics.</p> \n    <p>It was one\
  \ of the very few projects where nothing ever went backward. Everything anyone said\
  \ made it in. Because nothing—nothing at all—was too weird for the Harrow deck.\
  \ You can read more about the creation of that deck in <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo5la1k?A-Harrowing-Experience\"\
  >this ridiculous 2008 blog of mine</a>, and I encourage you to do so.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>In 2013, two card sets of mine came out. The first was <a href=\"/products/btpy97ei?Pathfinder-Cards-Deluxe-Harrow-Deck\"\
  >the Deluxe edition of the Harrow deck</a>.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  > <a href=\"/products/btpy97ei?Pathfinder-Cards-Deluxe-Harrow-Deck\"><img src=\"\
  //cdn.paizo.com/image/product/catalog/PZO/PZO3042.jpg\"></a> \n     <p>The Deluxe\
  \ Harrow Deck.</p>\n    </div> \n    <p>In this re-envisioned product, the cards\
  \ became tarot-sized and the overlay suit icons got replaced by alignment dots around\
  \ the edges, freeing up Kyle's art even more. It still functioned the same, with\
  \ the same names and imagery, but it sure looked a bit different.</p> \n    <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO3042-TheTheater.jpg\"\

  ></a> \n     <p>\"How you gonna do neutral?\" I asked. They figured it out.</p>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>Also in 2013, we had just finished core design on the first\
  \ Pathfinder Adventure Card Game set, Rise of the Runelords. Already, a buzz was\
  \ building about what we were concocting. Soon, we'd need to know what the second\
  \ PACG set would be.</p> \n    <p>\"It's Curse of the Crimson Throne,\" I said as\
  \ a final pronouncement. \"Because I want to make a totally new timer mechanic based\
  \ on the Harrow deck.\"</p> \n    <p>The finality of that pronouncement lasted about\
  \ 20 seconds. \"Whoa there, hoss,\" my collaborators said. \"We just spent a year\
  \ making your dumb thing work, and you want to start it over? Nope, and also nope.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>OK, so Skull &amp; Shackles. Fine. But, the third set for sure...</p>\
  \ \n    <p>I brought on Keith Richmond, as recounted in <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgms?Curse-of-the-Crimson-Throne-Comes\"\
  >this blog of his</a>, because for sure we were doing Curse real soon now. Except\
  \ we didn't. Wrath of the Righteous would be our plane-spanning epic tale, so Keith\
  \ cut his teeth on that. Then Mummy's Mask led us into the sands, and Keith helped\
  \ make that a reality. Also multiple seasons of organized play. Keith was working\
  \ on a lot of these game projects for us, but not the thing I actually brought him\
  \ on to make.</p> \n    <p>After Mummy's Mask, we needed to recalibrate. In 2018,\
  \ with many thousands of PACG cards out there, we wanted to cure some of the lingering\
  \ roughness in the game and give it a real cleanup. Finally, I said, \"Now. We're\
  \ doing Curse now. I'm getting my Harrow set.\"</p> \n    <p>Vic and Lisa agreed.\
  \ So we started in on Curse. I cannot tell you how liberating it felt to crack open\
  \ a Harrow deck and reimagine it a decade later. All of Kyle's mind-bending art,\
  \ all of those odd concepts that Wes and the Jameses and I kicked around, all the\
  \ ethereal meanings that Teeuwynn ascribed to every card—all of that was about to\
  \ become real. Cards now had to function. They had to mean one thing, not everything.</p>\

  ></a> \n     <p>New design by Sonja Morris, and a darn pretty one, says me.</p>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>Liz took the first pass on the Harrow blessings. She looked\
  \ at every weird idea that made it onto those cards and wrote whatever madness popped\
  \ into her head. Keith and Chad reworked her cool concepts. Aviva figured out how\
  \ everything should be said. I went through and made everything fit that original\
  \ Harrow vision.</p> \n    <p>Fifty-four new blessings, all themed to suits, was\
  \ the largest amount of blessings we'd ever designed at once. Not only did they\
  \ all need different play powers, but they also needed different \"when this is\
  \ the hour\" powers, and they all had to be different from the ones in the Core\
  \ Set. Most importantly, they needed to match whatever stories our original Harrow\
  \ deck put in your head.</p> \n    <p>After quite a bit of work, we had a new Harrow\
  \ deck for a whole new audience.</p> \n    <p>Except... we didn't have a harrowing,\
  \ per se. We had a few spells called various versions of Harrowing, and we had allies\
  \ called Harrowers, and we even had items called Harrow Decks.</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  ></a> \n     <p>Plus lots more Harrow cards.</p>\n    </div> \n    <p>But, we didn't\
  \ have any <em>divination</em>.</p> \n    <p>Keith figured that out. Well, he figured\
  \ a version of it out, but it was too big and complicated. Through many iterations,\
  \ we finally got down to something nice and simple. Each adventure, you'd gain a\
  \ Harrow blessing of the adventure's suit, which would affect your checks of the\
  \ related skill. Your harrow would follow you throughout the adventure, loading\
  \ itself into your hand at the start of each scenario. Sometimes you'd be thrilled\
  \ by what blessing governed your play; sometimes you'd be less thrilled. But, it\
  \ was yours for the adventure, like it or not.</p> \n    <p>Now and then, some of\
  \ the Harrow blessings were in players' decks, making the harrowing less fun. The\
  \ \"impossible rule\" covered this situation, and we made a rule that if we ran\
  \ out of blessings of the appropriate suit, we'd use ones of other Harrow suits.\
  \ A simple enough hack, but we wanted another approach.</p> \n    <p>So we tried\
  \ something else. We cracked one of my old Harrow decks to play the divination similarly\
  \ to the way Teeuwynn imagined it years earlier. Then we used the rules in the storybook\
  \ applying to whatever card each character got (assuming it was available). You\
  \ sure don't need a real Harrow deck for that purpose, but if you can get your hands\
  \ on one, you'll feel more deeply immersed in the adventure.</p> \n    <p>Along\
  \ with the whole team, Keith finally got <a href=\"/products/btq01ws8?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Curse-of-the-Crimson-Throne-Adventure-Path\"\
  ><em>Curse of the Crimson Throne</em></a> done like he wanted, and as a \"reward,\"\
  \ I made him be the president of my company. Me, I got my Harrow set. That time\
  \ a dozen years ago, when we made a crazy deck of cards that a generation of Pathfinders\
  \ interpreted in every possible way, was now part of my most adventurous project\
  \ for Paizo ever.</p> \n    <p>Sometimes Fate is a cruel mistress. But, sometimes,\
  \ if you just give her a chance, she smiles on you.</p> \n    <p>Mike Selinker<br>\
