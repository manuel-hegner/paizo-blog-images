  artist: "to check us out and pick up some of our newest products. Many got their\
    \ shiny new copies of GameMastery Module D1: Crown of the Kobold King, signed\
    \ by none other than author Nicolas Logue himself. We sold enough of the new GameMastery\
    \ Item Cards: Dragon's Trove deck to nearly empty the hoard (don't worry, we've\
    \ restocked it for Gen Con). But the big winners at the show were the Combat Pad\
    \ and the Critical Hit Deck. We had trouble keeping these hot products on the\
    \ shelf. Visitors who stopped by our booth on Saturday and Sunday got a special\
    \ treat, as we had a few early print copies of Pathfinder #1 on hand for fans\
    \ to flip through. I think you could hear the \"oohs\" and \"ahhs\" all the way\
    \ across the exhibit hall"

  artist: "yours truly... I guess I went a little kill-crazy). If you missed out on\
    \ your chance, you can always pick up Crown of the Kobold King (it should be arriving\
    \ in game stores any day now) or you can stop by our booth at Gen Con and try\
    \ your hand at our new delve event (based on GameMastery Module D2: Seven Swords\
    \ of Sin). With a bit of luck, that delve will have an even higher body count.\
