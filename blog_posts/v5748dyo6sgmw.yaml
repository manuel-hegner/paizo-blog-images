  \ \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">By now, you might have noticed an interesting\
  \ trend in the Alien Archives of the first few volumes of the <a href=\"/dawnofflame\"\
  >Dawn of Flame Adventure Path</a>. As is appropriate to the subject matter of these\
  \ adventures, <em>Fire Starters</em> introduces efreet and ifrits to the Starfinder\
  \ universe. In case you are unfamiliar, an efreeti is a genie from the Plane of\
  \ Fire, while ifrits are native outsiders who can trace their heritage to such beings\
  \ or other similar fiery entities. Really, no surprises for an Adventure Path that\
  \ takes place on (and in) the sun!</p> \n    <p>But then perhaps you noticed that\
  \ <em>Soldiers of Brass</em> features jann—genies whose nature is split across the\
  \ four elements—as well as sulis—native outsiders whose ancestors have connections\
  \ to the jann. Plus, this volume also includes sylphs—native outsiders who are descended\
  \ from beings from the Plane of Air, including djinn. But the stats for djinn are\
  \ nowhere to be seen... until you check out the Alien Archives of <em>Sun Divers</em>\
  \ that is!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7214-Suli.jpg\"\

  \ leaves the Planes of Earth and Water, and their respective genies and planar scions.\
  \ Unfortunately, you'll have to wait for the upcoming Dawn of Mud Adventure Path\
  \ for those!</p> \n    <p>Just kidding! You'll find the marid and shaitan genies,\
  \ as well as oreads and undines, in the upcoming volumes #17—<em>Solar Strike</em>—\
  and #18—<em>Assault on the Crucible</em>.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\

  \ \n    <p>Similar to the aasimar and tiefling planar scions introduced as playable\
  \ species in <em>Alien Archive 2</em>, all the elemental planar scions will also\
  \ be available as options for players. Each one provides slightly different ability\
  \ score adjustments. For examples, sylphs are bit more dexterous, while oreads have\
  \ powerful muscles. And each offers a different type of energy resistance; you won't\
  \ be surprised to know that ifrits are somewhat resistant to fire. But what sets\
  \ the planar scions apart from one another is that each receives a unique ability\
  \ tied to the elemental plane they can trace their ancestry to. Usually, this is\
  \ a simple spell-like ability, such as the undine's ability to cast energy ray at\
  \ will, though it can only deal cold damage. However, as sulis have an affinity\
  \ for all elements, they get a special ability that allows them to alter the type\
  \ of damage any weapon they wield can do for 1 round. A suli can set her boring\
  \ tactical doshko aflame and have it briefly deal half fire damage; she can even\
  \ do the same for her fist!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7213-Ifrit.jpg\"\

  \ \n     <p>Illustration by Mirco Paganessi</p> \n    </div> \n    <p>With the inclusion\
  \ of genies and elemental planar scions, we've added a healthy heaping of fantasy\
  \ to Starfinder's science-fantasy setting. We hope you enjoy them, and we can't\
  \ wait to see some cybernetically enhanced undines and power armor-wearing ifrits\
  \ out there!</p> \n    <p>Jason Keeley<br> <i>Developer</i></p> \n   </div> <!--\
