  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">I’m sorry, but that painting\
  \ isn’t for sale. This particular item I’m keeping for myself.</p> \n     <p>Why,\
  \ you ask? Well, there’s certainly worse ways to spend a rainy afternoon than in\
  \ sharing a story with friends like you, so if you’ve got the time to listen, I\
  \ can tell you a little bit about Crookcove, the Xarwins, and the house in that\
  \ painting.</p> \n     <p>I’ve got my own reasons to be interested in the place.\
  \ There, you see? At the top of the manor? A dome. A rotunda. An observatory. I’\
  ve had dreams of converting that manor’s observatory into a temple, a place where\
  \ anyone can come to observe the wonders of the Cosmic Caravan. But there’s a problem.\
  \ The manor itself is located at the remote southwestern corner of Ravounel, and\
  \ its ownership is kind of a tangled mess, one made worse by Ravounel’s secession\
  \ from Cheliax. No one seems to know who rightfully owns the place. There was a\
  \ sort of incident long ago, back when it was part of Cheliax, and the Chelish practice\
  \ of redactions did a number on the legal documents that hold the building’s fate.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Doesn’t help that Crookcove’s so far off the beaten path, or that the\
  \ government’s still got its hands full with more important things involving keeping\
  \ their independence, or that the closest point of civilization is so many miles\
  \ away.</p> \n     <p>Oh, and it certainly doesn’t help that they place is haunted.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>But I’m getting ahead of myself.</p> \n     <p>The town itself wasn’\
  t called Crookcove at first. It was founded by hellknights—the Order of the Gate,\
  \ to be precise—as a staging ground for the initial construction of Citadel Enferac,\
  \ way back in 4599. They called it “Crooked Cove,” on account of the shape of the\
  \ cove itself. Hellknights aren’t the most creative folks. In any event, Enferac’\
  s construction isn’t the story I’m telling.</p> \n     <p>The hellknights abandoned\
  \ their presence in Crooked Cove a few years after it was founded, and for a handful\
  \ of decades, the town was left to its own devices. The locals made a fair living\
  \ for themselves continuing to tend the mines and lumber operations the hellknights\
  \ started, but it wasn’t until the Thrunies took over the nation that Crooked Cove\
  \ attracted outside attention once again.</p> \n     <p>In the days following the\
  \ end of the Chelish Civil War, House Thrune began appointing minions into positions\
  \ of power throughout the nation. Most saw Ravounel as something of a backwater,\
  \ but not so a certain minor nobleman named Ioseff Xarwin. Details on how he managed\
  \ to secure the title of paracount are unclear, but what remains a matter of record\
  \ (in the few records you can find that aren’t redacted to the point of illegibility)\
  \ is that he was granted Crooked Cove as his seat of power.</p> \n     <p>Crooked\
  \ Cove had been largely untouched by the war, and according to my research, the\
  \ locals were initially wary of this new paracount and of the sprawling mansion\
  \ he’d started constructing on a bluff just outside town, but it wasn’t long before\
  \ their opinions changed. The people of Crooked Cove soon came to value the influx\
  \ of protection and support having a paracount provided, especially since Ioseff\
  \ allowed the townsfolk to largely retain their traditions and independence. He\
  \ saw to the construction of a church of Asmodeus, a tavern, a set of piers built\
  \ around a town hall that doubled as a shipyard, and a smelting house to support\
  \ the town’s trade, and in the span of a decade, Crooked Cove grew into a modestly\
  \ successful mining concern, and as long as the iron, lead, and copper in the hills\
  \ north of town continued to flow, Ioseff Xarwin left the townsfolk to their own\
  \ designs. In return, the flow of tax money and exports to Cheliax’s heartland continued\
  \ to guarantee Xarwin’s privacy.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\

  \ by Darko Stojanovic.</p>\n     </div> \n     <p>As a result of this pursuit for\
  \ privacy, further details were tough to track down, but I was able to determine\
  \ that Xarwin hadn’t chosen the site of his home idly. In one fragmentary letter\
  \ I regrettably wasn’t able to make copies of (and that was one of countless documents\
  \ lost in a fire a few months later), Xarwin himself hints that his “dreams were\
  \ instrumental in selecting the site, for the views of the night skies above seem\
  \ particularly inspiring.” He also mentioned in his letter that his “observatory’\
  s construction has surpassed all expectations.”</p> \n     <p>I did a bit more digging\
  \ and learned that Ioseff had a family as well—a wife and twin children. His wife,\
  \ Asethanna, was something of a well-known sculptor and painter, and by all accounts\
  \ the family lived their first many years in Crooked Cove in peace. But that didn’\
  t last. Something happened a decade and a half later. Again, details are hard to\
  \ come by, but from what little I’ve been able to piece together, the marriage crumbled\
  \ from within. Ioseff became more and more obsessed with his astronomical observations,\
  \ while Asethanna’s art started to grow darker and more sinister in theme.</p> \n\
  \     <p>It all came to a sudden end in 4657. Story goes that Asethanna fled the\
  \ manor one night with the twins, and that Xarwin grew increasingly hostile and\
  \ deranged. He let none visit his manor, and forbade the house servants from setting\
  \ foot off the manor grounds—at least, according to the account of one such servant\
  \ who claimed to have escaped from the manor. This unnamed servant apparently begged\
  \ for the local authorities to intervene, but they had no time to act on his claims.\
  \ The weather turned violent, with storms and floods devastating the town. And it\
  \ didn’t stop with violent weather. The people themselves turned violent as well.\
  \ Nightmares plagued the townsfolk when they slept, and when they woke the nightmares\
  \ pursued them in the form of brutality, cruelty, and suicide. It wasn’t long before\
  \ the townsfolk pulled up stakes and abandoned the place. Some say it was the storm\
  \ that damaged the town’s sign, others claim it was the last citizen to flee who\
  \ vandalized it, but to this day, those rare few who visit the place are greeted\
  \ by a sign welcoming them to “Crookcove.”</p> \n     <p>That’s about it, I’m afraid.\
  \ Other than stories of bad dreams by those rare few who stayed the night in the\
  \ region over the past several years, and some likely apocryphal tales of people\
  \ vanishing entirely after daring to enter Xarwin Manor itself, there’s little more\
  \ to learn about the place. There’s apparently no surviving heirs to the Xarwin\
  \ estate, and with Ravounel’s secession from Cheliax, the building’s been in government\
  \ escrow, pending whatever steps they need to take to unravel its legal status.\
  \ The manor itself is the only structure still standing in the region, with little\
  \ more than hollow shells of structures hinting at what was once a bustling mining\
  \ town down the hill below.</p> \n     <p>And all that brings us back to the painting.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>I started having my own dreams about Crookcove and Xarwin Manor a few\
  \ weeks after I picked up this painting, in any case. I’ve learned to trust my dreams—\
  they’re not always accurate in what they foretell, but they’re always worth paying\
  \ attention to, and there’s something in these dreams in particular that compel\
  \ me. Are they perhaps related to the same source of compulsive dreams that first\
  \ inspired Xarwin himself to build his home there? I can’t say other than that the\
  \ manor itself feels to me to be a place of power. A place of importance. A place\
  \ that should be restored and watched over. I’ve been saving up since then, and\
  \ one day soon I hope to be able to make the trip out to Ravounel, secure ownership\
  \ of the manor myself, and restore it. To rebuild it into a shrine to the Cosmic\
  \ Caravan. To find out what happened there.</p> \n     <p>I assume that you’ve deduced\
  \ by now what this painting depicts. Yes, here we see Xarwin Manor, in all its ruined\
  \ glory. I’ve had the fortune to interview no fewer than four people who visited\
  \ the ruins of Crookcove. None of them dared set foot in the manor proper, but they\
  \ all agree that the painting is spot-on in its accuracy in capturing the gloom\
  \ and menace the manor exudes today.</p> \n     <p>The part that bothers me about\
  \ it isn’t the brooding stance of the birds who seem to stand guard at the edge\
  \ of the frame, or the eerie glow that rises from beyond the central dome, or the\
  \ twisted reaches of the dead trees in the yard, or even the mysterious light in\
  \ the upstairs window.</p> \n     <p>The part that bothers me the most is the signature\
  \ and date on the painting’s reverse. The signature of Asethanna Xarwin, dated 4653\
  \ AR, four years before whatever doom came to Xarwin Manor and left it abandoned\
  \ over the ruins of a forgotten town.</p> \n     <p>—Wrin Sivinxi, owner of Wrin’\
