  \ second season, the <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgks?Starfinder-Society-Year-2\"\
  >\"Year of a Thousand Bites\"</a> begins! These two release scenarios set the tone\
  \ for our season, which ongoing Society fans might recognize as taking a bit of\
  \ a tonal shift from the overarching stories we had been telling. Without telling\
  \ too much about this upcoming year, it's safe to say that we'll be seeing fewer\
  \ jinsul-related problems and more concerns to be addressed back in the Pact Worlds!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Back in PaizoCon 2018, I had the privilege of a sitting at a table consisting\
  \ of five Obozaya's and an adopted \"Obo-Raia\" that went through <a href=\"/products/btpy9x0x?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-109-Live-Exploration-Extreme\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society #1-09: Live Exploration Extreme!</em></a>, as GMed by the\
  \ scenario's author, Organized Play Lead Developer John Compton. Along with being\
  \ a fantastic and memorable table, it also helped me select the author for our season\
  \ opener. Jenny Jarzabski (veteran Starfinder author of <a href=\"/products/btpy9x0w?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-107-The-Solar-Sortie\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society #1-07: The Solar Sortie</em></a> and <a href=\"/products/btq01vpt?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-129-Honorbound-Emissaries\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society #1-29: Honorbound Emissaries</em></a>) showcased her ability\
  \ to really push the reality TV angle of the scenario. This month's <a href=\"/products/btq01zn3?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-201-Pact-World-Warriors\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society #2-01: Pact World Warriors</em></a> takes Jenny's understanding\
  \ and puts it all into an amazing scenario where the PCs get the chance to play\
  \ on a variety of game shows to try and improve the Starfinder Society's standing\
  \ in light of a recent multimedia smear campaign. Beyond the fun theme of the scenario,\
  \ I'd strong suggest all our players arrange at least one sit down, if only to get\
  \ an introduction to an important up-and-coming NPC...</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  /products/btq01x4r?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-1017-On-Sevenfingerss-Sails\"><em>Fresh\
  \ from Pathfinder's Gloomspires</em></a>, author Tom Phillips eagerly picked up\
  \ June's second scenario and my shameless entreaties to bring his author talent\
  \ over to Starfinder. Like many scenarios, <a href=\"/products/btq01zn4?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-202-Waking-the-Past\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society #2-02: Waking the Past</em></a>, had its roots planted from\
  \ casual conversations between members of the Organized Play Team. In this case,\
  \ I'd just come off playing a popular video game that included a ceaseless force\
  \ that pursued the player throughout most the game. Combining elements of exploration\
  \ and survival horror, this month's second scenario really showcases that not all\
  \ problems can be defeated by pure combat strengthâ€”in fact, as a minor spoiler,\
  \ I'd suggest players for this scenario remember that escape is always an option!\
  \ From the stories I heard while at Origins, it's safe to say that this is a scenario\
  \ that makes a lot of long-lasting memories.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ></a> \n     <p>Illustration by William Marton</p>\n    </div> \n    <p>That brings\
  \ us to the end of this month's preview. Look forward to next month, where we reveal\
  \ a new introductory quest pack, as well as a higher tier scenario that takes us\
  \ back into the mysteries of the false moon known as Salvation's End. I can't wait\
  \ to start delving deeper into our upcoming second season and showing off just exactly\
  \ where the campaign is heading in the coming months; exciting times ahead, I assure\
  \ all of you!</p> \n    <p>Until next time,</p> \n    <p>Thurston Hillman<br> <i>Starfinder\
