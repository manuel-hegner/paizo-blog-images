  \ from the Delhi</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, November 18, 2008</p> \n \
  \  <p>The holidays are swiftly approaching, which means it's crunch time around\
  \ the Paizo offices as we race to get a bunch of awesome new products out the door\
  \ before all of us take time off to spend with our loved ones (parents, spouses,\
  \ Fallout 3).</p> \n   <p>The upside? We've got some <i>quality</i> books coming\
  \ out just in time for the gift-giving occasion of your choice! It's especially\
  \ true of Planet Storiesâ€”in addition to Henry Kuttner's <a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy81tx\"\
  ><i>The Dark World</i></a> and Leigh Brackett's masterful <a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy81tw\"\
  ><i>Hounds of Skaith</i></a>, December will see the release of Gary Gygax's <a href=\"\
  /planetStories/v5748btpy81ty\"><i>Death in Delhi</i></a>, the final of the three\
  \ standalone novels featuring Setne Inhetep, magical magistrate in the service of\
  \ Pharaoh himself. This time, Setne takes us east on an adventure through the heart\
  \ of an ancient India analogue filled with castes, corruption, and bloodthirsty\
  \ gods. We'll talk more about <i>Delhi</i> in weeks to come, but for now, check\
  \ out this scene snippet from Setne and Rachelle's treacherous journey to the lands\
  \ of the Peacock Throne:</p> \n   <blockquote> \n    <p>When it occurred, though,\
  \ the attack didn't come in a creeping manner. It was heralded by a wailing cry\
  \ which froze the blood of any victim not asleep. There was a silent rush of menacing\
  \ figures. It was impossible in the confusion of moonlight and shadow to tell how\
  \ many thugs were there. More than half a hundred, perhaps twice that number, and\
  \ one at least was capable of using potent heka. Whatever casting he sent at them,\
  \ both Inhetep and Rachelle were suddenly themselves again. That is, their Hindi\
  \ disguises were gone, and for the few heartbeats' time the change required, neither\
  \ could do aught but stand dazed, feeling the effects of the transformation.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Thugs!\" he managed to should to Rachelle. \"Stranglers of Kali!\"\
  </p> \n    <p>There was no free passage for the attackers, however. In a mere matter\
  \ of heartbeats after the time the practitioner among the crazed strangers activated\
  \ his casting, Magister Inhetep had triggered one of his own dweomers. There appeared\
  \ a sudden smoke arc as a hundred separate sparks winked into being. For a second\
  \ these motes glowed, in the next they brightened into a multi-hued array of blossoming\
  \ fires, and but a second after that each began its dance.</p> \n    <p>A flight\
  \ of them whizzed high in angry amber lines, making sounds as hornets do. Others\
  \ fluttered like butterflies with wings of flame. There were a dozen bright blue\
  \ serpentine paths traced along the ground, and violet arcs as if grasshoppers were\
  \ alight and on the move. Bright green embers jumped toward the onrushing attackers\
  \ as might insane frogs bent on meeting the assailants in midair. Some spiraled\
  \ aloft to spin and spit scintillating jets, which whirled crazily as their erratic\
  \ flight carried them outward from the wizard-priest who had invoked them, while\
  \ silvery and golden balls bounced and rolled forth in a determined fashion. Then,\
  \ finally, all hell broke loose...</p> \n   </blockquote> \n   <p>James Sutter<br>\
