              <p class="date">Tuesday, April 4, 2017</p>
              <p itemprop="description"><em>This is the eighth installment of our strategy blog written by game historian <a href="http://erzo.org/shannon/index.phtml" target="_blank">Shannon Appelcline</a>. You can read all the installments <a href="/paizo/blog/tags/adventureCardGameStrategy">here</a>.</em></p>
              <p>Though they're wholly good, boons can be hard encounters to deal with, because you must decide how much effort to expend when technically none is required. The catch is that you need to acquire <em>some</em> boons for the continued health of your deck. Prioritize their acquisition appropriately.</p>
              <h2>Spend the most effort to get cards for your deck</h2>
              <p>It's worth expending effort to get cards that would improve characters' decks, because improving decks is the name of the game. This means that you should prioritize the acquisition of cards from the current adventure deck, because they're likely to be better than what is currently in your group's decks. In addition, you should focus on any cards that will benefit <em>your</em> character. You'll know what the gaps are in your character's deck—where he's got a surplus of lower-level cards and which cards work well with his skills and powers. So it's easy to know when you should expend effort.</p>
              <p>Don't be afraid to discard and even bury cards to get boons of this sort. Be careful that you don't expend so many resources that you take a chance of losing the game... unless the card is <em>that</em> good, or unless you're losing already. In the latter case, go pig-from-hell wild and start expending <em>all</em> of your resources to get cool stuff.</p>
              <div class="blurbCenter">
               <img src="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-PR-PigFromHell_180.jpeg" alt="">
               <br><em>This card really doesn't have much to do with the topic—we just like saying “Pig from Hell.”</em>
              </div>
              <h2>Spend some effort to get cards for your hand</h2>
              <p>It's slightly less worthwhile to expend effort to collect boons that might be useful in your current game, but which you don't plan to keep. This includes allies and blessings that can give you turns, weapons that can let you attack, armor that can protect you, and spells that can do cool stuff.</p>
              <p>How much effort should you spend? That depends on how good the card is.</p>
              <p>For cards that can give you an exploration, like most blessings, it's worth spending a single blessing to guarantee (or nearly guarantee) its acquisition. Healing might allow you to see the new blessing more than once in a game, so at worst it's a break-even and at best it's an extra exploration later on. But one blessing should be the limit for a card you won't keep. And if you can instead expend a card that isn't worth an exploration (like Aid) or recharge a card to help, that's better.</p>
              <p>For cards that don't give you an exploration, it generally <em>isn't</em> worth spending a blessing, because you're effectively trading an exploration for it. However, acquiring a decent weapon or armor that would be helpful in the short term could be still be worth discarding a non-exploration-granting card or recharging something.</p>
              <p>And then you get to the bottom of the heap: cards that don't grant you a turn <em>and</em> aren't that great. Don't entirely ignore them; take a look and see if it serves a short-term purpose, like filling a gap in your hand. For example, if you don't have a weapon and you need a weapon, then it might be worth a minor cost to pick it up.</p>
              <p>Of course, context is always key. If you're going to have to stop exploring because you don't have a weapon in your hand, then clearly it's worth spending a blessing to get that weapon, but that's a relatively rare case.</p>
              <h2>Spend less effort to get fuel</h2>
              <p>Some characters can use cards for fuel: Lem can cycle them for spell bonuses, Lini can discard them to increase her stats, and Amiri can bury cards to get stat bonuses. For these characters, <em>all cards are useful</em>. As with any less useful cards intended just for your hand, it's probably not worth a blessing to acquire these cards, but it's definitely worth some effort. For a character that must <em>bury</em> cards for fuel, like Amiri, it's even more worthwhile, because she faces the danger of her deck decreasing in size over time (something that Lem rarely worries about).</p>
              <h2>Spend the least effort to get hit points</h2>
              <p>Remember that every card is, at the least, a hit point—something you can discard as damage. Since even the least useful card still has some value, it's <em>always</em> worthwhile to pick up a random card at no cost (and maybe at the cost of a recharge), even if you plan to throw it out at the end of the turn. Don't forget about your reveal and recharge abilities even when you're rolling for boons that are pure dross.</p>
              <h2>Spend at least some effort to gain trading stock</h2>
              <p>If you're playing <em>Mummy's Mask</em>, then you have an extra card-sink to think about: traders, who let you exchange boons you don't want (of a particular adventure deck number or higher) for something better. To avoid wasting this opportunity, make sure your party has picked up some extra boons by the time you win a scenario! You don't have to worry about this if you're just trading at the Sunburst Market, which has a cost of one boon: you'd usually be swapping something in your hand for something at the market, so no problem. But, the more specific a trader is, the higher his cost. For example, Agymah and Shardizhad require three boons for each of their items. Then you should worry!</p>
              <div class="blurbCenter">
               <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-SunburstMarket.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-SunburstMarket_180.jpeg" alt=""></a><a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6032-Shardizhadr.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6032-Shardizhad_180.jpeg" alt=""></a><a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6033-Agymah.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6033-Agymah_180.jpeg" alt=""></a>
               <br><em>You get what you pay for. Corollary: You pay for what you get.</em>
              </div>
              <p>To ensure that you <em>always</em> have enough trading stock for all your characters to trade, you need to have won a number of throwaway boons equal to the cost minus one for the trader that each player wants to visit. For example, if three players all wanted to visit Shardizhad and a fourth was going to the Sunburst Market, they'd need a total of six throwaway cards (plus the one each that they will usually be removing from their deck). However, this is probably an excessive count, because it's likely that many cards traders have to offer won't be any good for you. So, you'll only need enough throwaway boons for a few of the characters to trade — which is why trading stock is listed as the lowest priority here. If your group as a whole has already won a few non-interesting boons, you're probably fine. But maybe you need a few more if you plan to visit the more specific traders. However, if you're getting close to winning a scenario, and you don't have anything, then <em>spend a little effort to grab some boons</em> so that you can take full advantage of the traders at game's end.</p>
              <h2>Prioritize boons over banes</h2>
              <p>There's a big coda to this priority list of “boons to get”: You should generally work to encounter more boons than banes. Some of this is already covered in <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ljdt?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Strategy">Choosing Location Decks</a> and <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ljf8?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Strategy">Moving to New Locations</a>: you might choose to start at a location because its boon-heavy, or you might choose to move to a location because a boon is on top of a deck. But be aware that you can also manipulate your decks to maximize boons. Use Auguries to push monsters and barriers down to the bottom. Use a Magic Spyglass to look at the top three cards in a deck, and if they're all banes, find a way to reshuffle the deck—perhaps even by leaving a bane undefeated! Mind you, if you're playing Mummy's Mask, Trigger cards can make explicit examination more difficult, so in that game consider other means to maximize your boons, like moving away from a deck when you've cleared out most of the boons. Just remember: To acquire boons, you must encounter boons. (Some restrictions may apply; always worry about <em>closing</em> locations first!)</p>
