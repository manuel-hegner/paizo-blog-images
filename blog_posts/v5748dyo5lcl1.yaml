  \ class=\"PTales\"></div></a> \n   <h1>A Passage to Absalom</h1> \n   <p>by Dave\
  \ Gross</p> \n   <h2>Chapter Three: Peach Brandy</h2> \n   <p>My pronouncement of\
  \ death silenced the room. Everyone else stared as I knelt beside the corpse. I\
  \ watched for clues in their faces.</p> \n   <p>Lady Neverion clutched the nearest\
  \ arm, which happened to belong to Captain Qoloth. The hirsute ship’s master patted\
  \ the woman’s hands, but his eyes remained locked on the dead man. His grimace deepened\
  \ into a scowl.</p> \n   <p>Young Murviniel peered around the captain’s shoulder\
  \ with naked curiosity, his brow furrowing as he inspected the dead man’s countenance.\
  \ Whatever killed Menas Neverion had burst the veins in his eyes and colored his\
  \ face purple.</p> \n   <p>Beside the elf, the dwarves gaped at the dead man. Pekko\
  \ appeared confused, but considering his flushed cheeks and the two goblets in his\
  \ hands, I concluded he was simply inebriated. He raised a goblet toward his mouth,\
  \ but Jaska lay a hand on his arm and shook his head until Pekko noticed the sherry\
  \ glass lying beside the dead man. Pekko set both goblets carefully on a sideboard\
  \ and wiped his hands on his shirt.</p> \n   <p>I could not at first see Shadya.\
  \ She had retreated from the corpse until her back pressed against the ship’s bulkhead.\
  \ She pressed a fist against her mouth and stared at the floor, in either utter\
  \ revulsion or else an excellent facsimile of that emotion. When she saw Radovan\
  \ looking at her, she looked away.</p> \n   <p>A loud whistle pierced the silence.\
  \ At Qoloth’s signal, a crewman opened the door. </p>\n   <p>“Escort this lady to\
  \ the empty cabin.” The captain drew Charikla Neverion away from the corpse of her\
  \ husband.</p> \n   <p>“But sir, it is full of the dwarves’ extra cargo—”</p> \n\
  \   <p>“Then remove it.”</p> \n   <p>“Aye, sir. But where—?”</p> \n   <p>“I don’\
  t give a damn!” bellowed Qoloth. “Can’t you see the lady is distraught? You can\
  \ put the cargo on deck or in the bilge for all I care.”</p> \n   <p>“Wait, wait!”\
  \ sputtered Jaska. “The contents are fragile. I will go with you.”</p> \n   <p>Before\
  \ Qoloth could object, Lady Neverion shrieked.</p> \n   <p>“Ladybug, no!”</p> \n\
  \   <p>One of the lady’s tiny dogs lapped at the damp spot beside the fallen glass.\
  \ Radovan scooped up the tiny creature and snagged its mate before it too could\
  \ sample the spilled sherry. He poured the shivering dogs into Charikla’s arms,\
  \ and she hugged them to her breast while recoiling from him. To his credit, Radovan\
  \ pretended not to notice her disdain.</p> \n   <div class=\"blurb360\">\n    <a\
  \ href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Neverion.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Neverion_360.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    <br>\"Lady Neverion certainly seems distraught. But then,\
  \ when doesn't she?\"\n   </div> \n   <p>Qoloth’s head wobbled as though he were\
  \ stifling the urge to shout some more. Instead he simply steered Lady Neverion\
  \ toward his crewman before waving them and Jaska from the room. As the door closed\
  \ behind them, Qoloth muttered, “Gold—Fisted Abadar, couldn’t you have given the\
  \ fat fool his heart attack in Absalom?”</p> \n   <p>I suppressed the urge to stop\
  \ Qoloth from letting the others go, as the captain had already cautioned me not\
  \ to challenge his authority. Even so, I could not stop myself from correcting him.\
  \ “Lord Neverion did not die of natural causes. He was murdered.”</p> \n   <p>“\
  Poison?”</p> \n   <p>I nodded, tugging a handkerchief from my sleeve. </p> \n  \
  \ <p>“It was the sherry, wasn’t it?” Pekko slurred. He pressed the backs of his\
  \ hands against his cheeks and forehead. “Great gods and little fishes, he had only\
  \ two. I drank four. No, seven!”</p> \n   <p>I lifted the glass Menas had dropped,\
  \ careful to shield my bare skin with the handkerchief. In addition to the impression\
  \ of the dead man’s lips and a few remaining drops of sherry, I perceived a faint\
  \ discoloration around the outer rim of the glass.</p> \n   <p>“It would appear\
  \ you are in no danger,” I assured the dwarf.</p> \n   <p>Murviniel bent low to\
  \ examine the glass, placing his face close to mine in a careless gesture of familiarity.\
  \ His breath smelled of nettle tea as he whispered, “Satyr’s tears.”</p> \n   <p>The\
  \ faint blue tint of the otherwise unobtrusive stain led me to the same conclusion.\
  \ I stood. “You are familiar with poisons?”</p> \n   <p>Murviniel also stood. “\
  Not poisons especially, no,” he said. “But with herbs in general, yes. I suppose\
  \ I should have kept quiet.”</p> \n   <p>“Why?”</p> \n   <p>“Well, I’ve just made\
  \ myself a suspect, haven’t I?”</p> \n   <p>“Everyone is a suspect.”</p> \n   <p>“\
  I’m not,” said Qoloth. “Murder aboard ship’s bad for business. If Neverion’s death\
  \ is somehow related to this stolen book of yours, I expect you to sort it out before\
  \ we reach port.”</p> \n   <p>“Then you withdraw your objections to my using magic?”\
  \ Much as I deplore divination spells as a cheat, in this matter I was willing to\
  \ stoop. Allowing the power of the <i>Lacuna Codex</i> to be unleashed upon the\
  \ world was too terrible to consider, and it seemed quite possible that I would\
  \ discover a link between the theft and the murder.</p> \n   <p>Qoloth barked a\
  \ dismissive laugh. “When I told you there’s no magic aboard the <i>Sea Lion</i>,\
  \ I wasn’t objecting. I was stating a fact.”</p> \n   <p>I should have realized\
  \ sooner that the Katapeshi’s exorbitant fare included certain amenities not commonly\
  \ available on other vessels. Many wealthy travelers were happy to pay a premium\
  \ for protection from magical detection or attack while traversing the Inner Sea.\
  \ I had simply engaged the first available passage, heedless of the expense. </p>\
  \ \n   <p>“You cannot deactivate the effect?”</p> \n   <p>“I’m a sailor, not a sorcerer,”\
  \ said Qoloth. I saw no evidence of falsehood in his expression, but he was the\
  \ bold sort of man to whom big lies come easy.</p> \n   <p>“Very well,” I said.\
  \ “In that case, I wish to begin questioning those present. Would you be so good\
  \ as to have your crew escort the men to their cabins, there to remain until I visit?”\
  </p> \n   <p>Qoloth narrowed his eyes, perhaps deciding whether my request sounded\
  \ too much like a command. Now that the captain had endorsed my investigation, it\
  \ was imperative that I establish some measure of authority without undermining\
  \ his.</p> \n   <p>“Good,” he said. “Report to me at eight bells.”</p> \n   <p>The\
  \ ship’s cook had struck four bells just before we arrived at the Neverion’s cabin.\
  \ Informing the captain of my progress less than two hours hence would interrupt\
  \ what would doubtless prove an arduous inquiry. Nevertheless, if reaffirming Qoloth’\
  s authority in this manner would permit me greater freedom to investigate, I would\
  \ be content. I bowed my assent.</p> \n   <p>As the others departed, Qoloth whistled\
  \ up another pair of sailors to remove Neverion’s body to the cold locker. As the\
  \ corpse vanished from sight, Shadya spoke. “Please, Captain. Don’t leave me alone\
  \ with them.” </p> \n   <p>Qoloth paused at the door. He followed Shadya’s gaze\
  \ to Radovan, who offered him the little smile and a parody of a naval salute. </p>\
  \ \n   <p>“Allow me to apologize for the manner in which my associate retrieved\
  \ my purse,” I began. “I assure you that my inquiry will remain strictly verbal.”\
  \ While my apology was sincere, it also served to remind Qoloth of the circumstances\
  \ preceding Radovan’s frisking. Shadya had already proven herself less than trustworthy.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Qoloth summoned another sailor to stand watch inside the room. There was\
  \ little harm in that, I thought, so long as Shadya revealed nothing I wished to\
  \ keep from the captain’s ears. He did not seem a likely candidate for the theft,\
  \ but for the murder I knew I must not discount anyone.</p> \n   <p>The moment the\
  \ door closed behind Qoloth, Radovan said, “Knock it off, sister. You’re not fooling\
  \ anyone with the delicate routine. The captain’s this close to letting us toss\
  \ your room. I wonder what we’ll find tucked beneath your mattress.”</p> \n   <p>Rather\
  \ than intercede, I awaited her response. My bodyguard had chosen the proper tack.\
  \ My courtesy had granted Shadya an undue sense of security. Radovan, in his coarse\
  \ manner, had disrupted her cool facade.</p> \n   <p>She hesitated, but her countenance\
  \ still betrayed more shock than umbrage. Unless I misread her, she was truly surprised\
  \ by Neverion’s death. </p> \n   <p>“I didn’t know the man,” she said. “His wife\
  \ has a few tempting jewels, I admit, but there was nothing for me in his death.”\
  </p> \n   <p>“You did not partake of the sherry,” I said.</p> \n   <p>She hesitated,\
  \ and in her eyes I saw that she was considering her answer. “I almost did,” she\
  \ said. “I arrived shortly before you. When I went to greet our hosts, that woman\
  \ threw me such an icy glare that I thought better of it.”</p> \n   <p>All too well\
  \ I understood my peers’ ability to shun undesirables with a glance. So did Radovan,\
  \ who had experienced such snubs far more often than I.</p> \n   <p>“Very well.”\
  \ I signaled the sailor to open the cabin door. </p> \n   <p>“That’s it?” Shadya\
  \ sounded almost disappointed.</p> \n   <p>“That is all for now.” I bowed.</p> \n\
  \   <p>Radovan and I navigated the narrow passage to Murviniel’s berth, passing\
  \ a lone sailor who stood watch over the passenger cabins. Inwardly I approved of\
  \ the captain’s caution, but I wondered how well the crewman could overhear conversations\
  \ within the cabins. Judging from the sound of movement inside Murviniel’s cabin,\
  \ I expected the guard could hear anything spoken above a whisper.</p> \n   <p>The\
  \ elf spoke before I could greet him. “Lord Neverion served the sherry himself.\
  \ I didn’t notice anyone else handling the glasses, but I think one of the crew\
  \ set up their sideboard. I don’t know which one, but of course the captain would.”\
  </p> \n   <p>While pretending to listen, I observed Murviniel’s quarters. He had\
  \ strewn his personal belongings haphazardly throughout the small cabin. I lifted\
  \ a battered volume of spells from the bed. “You study magic?”</p> \n   <p>“Yes,”\
  \ said the elf. “My brother gave me his first spellbook. I’m not much past the cantrips,\
  \ I’m afraid.”</p> \n   <p>“The Society can always use another practitioner of the\
  \ arcane.”</p> \n   <p>Among the other swollen and dog-eared books that had escaped\
  \ Murviniel’s backpack, I spied a copy of my own <i>Bestiary of Garund</i> and thought\
  \ of his earlier fawning. Had he left it out in an obsequious gesture?</p> \n  \
  \ <p>Radovan recognized the book and understood the meaning of its presence. He\
  \ rubbed his eye in a rude gesture to indicate what he thought of Murviniel’s ploy.\
  \ It was only a matter of time before the elf solicited my support in his application\
  \ to the Pathfinder Society.</p> \n   <p>“What else can I tell you?” Murviniel said,\
  \ apparently oblivious to the communication that passed between Radovan and me.\
  \ “I arrived after the dwarves, but before everyone else. No one was talking of\
  \ anything but the motion of the ship and the favorable wind. The Qadiran girl and\
  \ the dwarf Jaska did not drink the sherry, but everyone else did. The other dwarf\
  \ was already half in his cups before he arrived. He and Neverion acted like old\
  \ friends, but I could have sworn they had never met before boarding the ship.”\
  </p> \n   <p>“What herbs do you carry in that pack of yours?”</p> \n   <p>“Ah,”\
  \ said the elf. His eyes brightened, the opposite of the usual reaction to my changing\
  \ the subject. “I thought you might ask, so I emptied my pack. Here, you can see\
  \ them all. Not much here, just these two pouches for tea. I’m not a practicing\
  \ herbalist. I’ve mostly just read a few books.”</p> \n   <p>In addition to the\
  \ nettle I detected on his breath earlier, I recognized a mélange of rosehips, hibiscus,\
  \ and peppermint commonly steeped as a relaxing tisane. Neither mixture was the\
  \ least bit toxic, and both suggested that Murviniel was of a delicate constitution,\
  \ probably suffering from some urinary dysfunction.</p> \n   <p>Before I could frame\
  \ a question he had not already anticipated, Murviniel came to his point. “If there\
  \ is any way I could assist you in this investigation, Your Excellency, I would\
  \ be only too happy to put myself at your service.”</p> \n   <p>I weighed the likely\
  \ distraction of the young elf’s assistance against any genuine help he might provide.\
  \ In truth, I had chosen to speak with him next only to give Pekko time to sober\
  \ up and fret about what I would ask him. Considering the famed fortitude of dwarven\
  \ drinkers, I decided the time was now. “We shall talk more tomorrow.”</p> \n  \
  \ <p>“But—is there nothing else?”</p> \n   <p>“Not at this time, thank you.”</p>\
  \ \n   <p>We left Murviniel gasping like a beached fish, his hopes frustrated. Radovan\
  \ smiled and scratched the back of his neck as we left the cabin. “Kid’s got it\
  \ bad.”</p> \n   <p>“We were all young once.”</p> \n   <p>“Even you?” he said. “\
  Somehow I can’t picture that.”</p> \n   <p>I stopped before the door to the dwarves’\
  \ cabin. My keen hearing detected no sound but the rhythmic creaking of the ship\
  \ as it rose and descended upon the waves. At my signal, Radovan rapped on the portal.\
  \ When no reply came, he tried the latch and found it unlocked. He opened the door\
  \ to reveal a small cabin crowded with several crates lodged between the two bunks.\
  \ On the tiny space of floor that remained sprawled Pekko. A few inches from his\
  \ hand lay a pewter flask and funnel, beside it a spilled bottle of liquid exuding\
  \ the unmistakable odor of peach brandy.</p> \n   <p>Pekko lay quite motionless,\
  \ his face the color of a ripe eggplant.</p> \n   <p><b>Coming Next Week:</b> Uncomfortable\
