  \ who viewed ten years and three children as a \"fling,\" he had hoped to rear homebody\
  \ children. Even with their halfblood status stretching the years he spent with\
  \ his treasured children, the old marshal shuddered at the knowledge that one was\

  \ took to the practical household arts and younger Milliceene pursued a love of\
  \ natural sciences, middle-born Lirianne lost herself for hours at a time in tales\
  \ of shining knights, devious fairies, and mighty dragons—all subjects absent from\
  \ her homeland of Alkenstar. Raised among bricks, smoke, and bureaucracy, the young\
  \ half-elf dreamed of the life of adventure and fantasy promised by the collection\
  \ of fairy tales left by her absent mother and her own ever-growing library of penny\
  \ dreadfuls. Naturally, she aspired to follow in her father's footsteps and become\
  \ a shieldmarshal, protecting Alkenstar from the hostile giants and hideous mutations\
  \ of the Mana Wastes. Preferring to keep his little girl safe at home, Dahmok calmly\
  \ explained she could never become a shieldmarshal, running with the first excuse\
  \ he could come up with—that her beloved long hair would become entangled in firearm\
  \ mechanisms. To his surprise, he awoke the next morning to discover Lirianne grinning\
  \ like a fool, with her long tresses roughly chopped, eagerly packed and ready to\
  \ follow him to work.</p> \n   <p>For twenty years, the little half-elf pushed herself\
  \ to meet ever more insane requirements laid down by her aging father. Schoolmates\
  \ nicknamed her \"the Phantom\" as she vanished often to practice her quick draw\
  \ or memorize technical volumes. Tutors and governesses thought her adle-brained\
  \ as she sat staring, redrawing engineer's schematics in her mind rather than follow\
  \ her lessons. Even before she was old enough to entertain her first romance, she\
  \ had mastered the construction and firing of a rifle, and could reckon complex\
  \ trajectories by eye alone.</p> \n   <p>An old man and long since retired by the\
  \ time his daughter reached womanhood, Dahmok could no longer forbid her entry into\
  \ the shieldmarshals. But the old patriot's influence lived on in his successors,\
  \ and to honor his service they assigned Lirianne to a quiet domestic position,\
  \ safeguarding farming settlements along the secure Alkenstar-Martel road. Ten years\
  \ of her life passed rounding up drunks and mediating water rights, eating away\
  \ at her passion for adventure in ways her father's disapproval never could. Her\
  \ childhood dreams eventually forgotten, Lirianne's steely eyes dulled with the\
  \ tarnish of a thousand mundane details.</p> \n   <p>It was kismet when a storm\
  \ of wild magic blew off the Spellscar Desert, past Alkenstar, and into her jurisdiction.\
  \ The rampant arcane energy, fallout from centuries of wizard warfare, warped space\
  \ and time around it. The magical swells lashed out, reshaping hillsides, boiling\
  \ sand into glass, and calling forth bizarre creatures from the dawn of history.\
  \ The only marshal at hand, Lirianne leapt into service. As townsfolk huddled in\
  \ their cellars and buildings crumbled into twisted forms of misbegotten wood and\
  \ bone, a bolt of green lightning lashed out, striking the half-elf even as she\
  \ confronted the storm's abominations.</p> \n   <p>Lirianne awoke soaking and half-drowned\
  \ on distant shores. The bizarre country was flush with thick forests and green\
  \ hills—plant life like she'd never seen. Wandering inland, she soon encountered\
  \ a lumber caravan beset by malicious fey. In a heartbeat, a childhood's worth of\
  \ stories welled up inside her, and she rushed into battle with a passion long since\
  \ forgotten. The grateful caravan loaded her with all the supplies and information\
  \ she could manage, confirming that her inexplicable odyssey had deposited her cleanly\
  \ in the midst of those same shining knights, devious fairies, and mighty dragons\
  \ who had occupied so much of her youth.</p> \n   <p>Now a wanderer in the strange\
  \ land of Avistan, Lirianne struggles to balance her resurgence of childhood wonder\
  \ and adult dedication to justice, all while confronting her long-ignored elven\
  \ blood. While thoughts of family and the familiar industrial life of Alkenstar\
  \ occasionally tug at her roaming heart, sights remain unseen and people remain\
  \ unsaved, and Lirianne will be damned if she'll fail in either. </p>\n   <p>Crystal\
