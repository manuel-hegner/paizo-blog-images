  \ <h3>Michael Sayre, Paizo Designer (he/him)</h3> \n      <p>Growing up, my grandpa’\
  s Tlingit stories showed me how storytelling works as a vehicle for culture and\
  \ values (and how it’s a great way to pass the time waiting for the fish to bite!)\
  \ Those stories of kushtaka and little men in the woods excited me, and I remember\
  \ hanging on my grandpa’s every word, realizing how his cadences and storytelling\
  \ devices had been passed to my uncles, who would use the same rhythm even for different\
  \ stories, which were all so hypnotic and mesmerizing. I remember the elders at\
  \ the rec center and other events who would tell stories I’d never heard before\
  \ but which were still so familiar.</p> \n      <p>Stories of Raven helped me contextualize\
  \ the cleverness and skill of Tlingit elders and leaders in a modern environment,\
  \ and I’d only continue to discover the value and power of some of those stories\
  \ as I grew older. Stories about Bear (both ally and obstacle) helped me realize\
  \ how strong people can be when I thought that people, especially me, were just\
  \ weak and flawed. All of those stories and experiences helped make me realize that\
  \ I wanted to tell stories of my own. Gunalchèesh ax eet yeelatûowu.</p> \n    \
  \  <p>Taking the first steps to telling those stories never would have happened\
  \ without the support of Goldbelt, our tribal corporation, that assisted me on numerous\
  \ occasions with education and health care related issues that would have forced\
  \ different life choices if I’d had to navigate them without a corporation representing\
  \ a rich tapestry of communities supporting me. What I am, all the Tlingit &amp;\
  \ Haida people of southeast Alaska helped me be.</p> \n      <br> \n      <h3>Jessica\
  \ Catalan, Paizo Developer (she/her)</h3> \n      <p>Hi everyone! My name is Jessica\
  \ Catalan (she/her), and I’m a Canadian, Métis freelancer author and Starfinder\
  \ Line Developer for the Starfinder Society. This year, Canada held its first National\
  \ Day for Truth and Reconciliation, an annual commemoration honoring the children\
  \ who died while attending residential schools and the survivors, families, and\
  \ communities still affected by the legacy of the residential school system. While\
  \ this is a step forward for us, reconciliation without action is just words and\
  \ there is much to be done. I’ll spare you the newscast. </p> \n      <p>I’m not\
  \ much of a speaker, but as many of us have realized over the past two years, while\
  \ one voice can be silenced, together we are strong, and we can be heard. So, in\
  \ addition to raising my voice and lending my support to Every Child Matters, MMIWG2S,\
  \ and other movements here in Canada, I can take two concrete steps I’d like to\
  \ mention today: reclamation and amplification.</p> \n      <p>Today, I’m here to\
  \ amplify. I encourage you to look at the other names on this blog—check out their\
  \ works, support them on ko-fi or patreon, back and purchase their projects, follow\
  \ them on social media. Hear them. Keep an eye out for other Indigenous works, such\
  \ as <em>Coyote &amp; Crow</em>, and support the people involved. And if you’re\
  \ an Indigenous TTRPG author who loves Starfinder and is struggling to have your\
  \ voice heard, reach out to me. I’m listening. </p> \n      <br> \n      <h3>Carlos\
  \ Cabrera, Paizo Contributor (he/him)</h3> \n      <p>Hi there, my name is Carlos\
  \ Cabrera. I am mixed, but I identify as Mexican, Indigenous (Mescalero Apache),\
  \ and Cape Verde (Portuguese and African). At first, I was going to write something\
  \ for both Hispanic Heritage Month and Native American Heritage Month, but when\
  \ I started looking into my family history—closer than I ever have before—I had\
  \ to take some time for myself. The facts were not very pretty, and history was\
  \ not kind to my family as early as either grandparent on my father’s side.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>I also grew up in a white household. My mother's family comes from\
  \ a variety of European countries, and even a little Cherokee as history also likes\
  \ to dictate. There are other idiosyncrasies there as well, but I recognize that\
  \ my upbringing comes with a certain amount of privilege. Earlier this year, I wrote\
  \ to the Mescalero Apache Reservation to see if my family had any affiliation. My\
  \ relief when I discovered they were not was short-lived. The facts of how my family\
  \ avoided that were not any prettier.</p> \n      <p>I think that is why I pledged\
  \ a copy of the <em>Coyote &amp; Crow</em> RPG to the reservation and continue to\
  \ write to this day. I hope it inspires someone to either get into games or go on\
  \ their own grand adventure, even if they don't have the luxury of walking out their\
  \ front door like I did. Maybe one day I can even pay them. I think that would be\
  \ my American Dream.</p> \n      <br> \n      <table class=\"image\" align=\"left\"\

  \ (they/them)</h3> \n      <p>Kúha’ahat, táy:sha’! I’m Shay Snow and I’m mixed Native\
  \ American. My family stems from two separate tribes—my mother’s tribe is Caddo\
  \ and my father’s tribe is Swampy Cree. Both tribes have strong matriarchal ties,\
  \ so when introducing myself I lead with my mother’s tribe and then follow-up with\
  \ my father’s tribe. I can’t speak on being just a Native TTRPG creator, but I can\
  \ speak on being a Caddo and Swampy Cree creator.</p> \n      <p>Being a Caddo creator\
  \ means crafting your words carefully, knowing that your language is dying. Being\
  \ a Caddo creator means trying to take all of the nuance of your language, the humor,\
  \ the care, the cadence that warms your heart and makes you want to move when it’\
  s spoken, and trying to put it into a language that your family was forced to adopt\
  \ and speak. Being a Caddo creator means trying to find rhythm and when you can’\
  t find it, forcing that rhythm into your work so that hopefully your words make\
  \ other people want to move and dance.</p> \n      <p>Being a Swampy Cree creator\
  \ means moving slowly through the minefield that is your history and trying to pluck\
  \ the safe bits out so that your heritage doesn’t accidentally cause you pain. Being\
  \ a Swampy Cree creator means knowing that some parts of your culture have been\
  \ taken and commodified and it’s now on your shoulders to look at those spirits\
  \ and offer your respect as you try to carefully tell their stories without causing\
  \ danger or harm. </p> \n      <p>Being a Native creator in 2021 has meant creating\
  \ and crafting with careful words and tools while also being painfully aware of\
  \ everything pouring into the news and media over the past year. It means writing\
  \ and trying to bring joy while burning sweetgrass and mourning over loved ones\
  \ lost recently and loved ones lost long ago and recently found.</p> \n      <p>My\
  \ name is Shay Snow, I live on unceded Caddo and Wichita land, and my family calls\
  \ me Little Jay.</p> \n      <br> \n      <p><b>To all members of our community\
  \ with indigenous heritage: thank you for all you do as creators, GMs, players,\
