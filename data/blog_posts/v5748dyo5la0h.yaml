  \ a Good Kobold Down</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Monday, May 5, 2008</p> \n   \
  \ <p>In <i>Revenge of the Kobold King</i> the PCs once again find themselves facing\
  \ perilous death in Darkmoon Vale, but this time they are working for a man as dangerous\
  \ as any monster prowling the shadowy forest. </p> \n    <p>Thuldrin Kreed, by far\
  \ the most powerful of Darkmoon Vale's lumber barons has long ruled Falcon's Hollow\
  \ with a clenched fist, feeding on the misery of its common folk. When some undetermined\
  \ and insidious force menaces his interests in the vale and leaves a camp of lumberjacks\
  \ slaughtered in the night, Kreed requires a band of brave fools to deal with the\
  \ threat. </p> \n    <p>Interested in the job? Have a little chat with Thuldrin\
  \ Kreed, Gavel of the Lumber Consortium: </p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>\"We\
  \ all know I'm a mean ol' bastard. I bleed these men and women for all they've got,\
  \ but I pay them square, and there ain't no chains on their wrists. You think I\
  \ don't care about these men? Then you're a fool. I need them. Sure I may grind\
  \ these men to paste with years of back-breaking toil, but whatever's out there\
  \ now is killing em. Nobody's puts a knife to my men but me. You go out there and\
  \ get what did this. I'll not have my men slaughtered like pigs. </p> \n     <p>\"\
  Boss Teedum's going with you to make sure you succeed. I do not trust a task like\
  \ this to outsiders alone. Those men deserve justice that's for certain, but more\
  \ importantly I'm not about to let anything threaten my interests in the Vale. If\
  \ you fail, get your bowels opened on a blade, find yourself between a monster's\
  \ jaws, or just plain loose the steel in your spine, Pay Day's there to pick up\
  \ what you drop and see it through. I'm not laying down for monsters, stumpy dwarf\
  \ ghosts or the prancing fey. This Vale is mine, and I'll keep it. I'll burn the\
  \ whole gods-be-damned forest to ash before I let someone take it from me.\" </p>\
