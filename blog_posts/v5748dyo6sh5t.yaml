  \ \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">I just wanted to update you with new information\
  \ about how the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting Paizo and what it means for you.\
  \ As you know, the situation is changing rapidly and the team here at Paizo is having\
  \ to take in new government rules, regulations, and health department guidance on\
  \ almost a daily basis.</p> \n     <p>On Monday, March 23rd, Washington State Governor\
  \ Jay Inslee issued a stay-at-home order for non-essential businesses. Most of Paizo\
  \ has been working from home for a while now, but our warehouse team had been continuing\
  \ to ship orders to distributors and paizo.com customers. Paizo will now be closing\
  \ our warehouse for two weeks starting on the evening of Wednesday, March 25 and\
  \ put those workers on a paid furlough during that time. The team is working hard\
  \ to finish March subscription shipments before this shutdown. After two weeks,\
  \ we plan to resume warehouse shipments unless the situation dictates that we do\
  \ otherwise. Our customer service team will continue to work from home answering\
  \ your questions. They have a thread on our forums to keep customers updated with\
  \ their progress on customer requests: <a href=\"https://paizo.com/threads/rzs42z7x?Paizo-Customer-Service-Status-Updates-What\"\
  >Paizo Customer Service Status Updates &amp; What to Do</a>.</p> \n     <p>We can\
  \ still fulfill PDF sales, and we will be launching a PDF sale later this week.\
  \ Buying PDFs is a great way to help Paizo get through these troubling times as\
  \ well as getting great gaming products at great prices! Watch for an email announcing\
  \ the sale in your inbox later this week.</p> \n     <p>I must also announce that\
  \ we have made the decision to cancel PaizoCon 2020. Though we and our partners\
  \ at the DoubleTree Hotel believe this is the best course of action for the safety\
  \ of our staff and attendees, this is particularly sad for us because we at Paizo\
  \ really enjoy having the chance to hang out with all of you and play games for\
  \ a weekend. There will be a number of options for dealing with your badge and banquet\
  \ ticket purchases, including rolling it forward to next year with a nice gift waiting\
  \ for you at PaizoCon 2021 to thank you for sticking with us through these times.\
  \ If you have purchased a badge, look for an email explaining your options soon.\
  \ Our customer service team would greatly appreciate if you could wait to contact\
  \ them about PaizoCon badge options until after we have sent out the email to badge\
  \ holders.</p> \n     <p>The staff has been hard at work from home. <em>The Pathfinder\
  \ Advanced Playerâ€™s Guide</em> and the Starfinder <em>Starship Operations Manual</em>\
  \ have both been sent to the printer to be delivered in time for Gen Con, and other\
  \ products are going to the printer each week. There is a light at the end of this\
  \ tunnel, and we want to make sure that there are new roleplaying game products\
  \ there for you to enjoy when we get through it.</p> \n     <p>Once again, thanks\
  \ so much for your kind words of support and your continued patronage of our products.\
  \ Together, we can get through these difficult times. We look forward to seeing\
  \ many of you at the gaming table soon.</p> \n     <p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\
