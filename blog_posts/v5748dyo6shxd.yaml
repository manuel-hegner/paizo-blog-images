  \ Fiction Day in the U.S., so it feels a bit like a communal unbirthday for every\
  \ author who writes weird fiction speculating about what <em>might</em> happen.\
  \ I took a stroll around the virtual office to talk with some of my colleagues,\
  \ who are science fiction authors and game designers themselves, and asked them\
  \ to talk about their personal connections to sci-fi, their inspirations, and what\
  \ kind of stories interest them. </p> \n      <table class=\"image\" align=\"left\"\

  \ come as a surprise to no one that my biggest sci-fi influences are largely comedic.\
  \ I mean, when faced with yawning infinite void of space, you just have to laugh,\
  \ right? For me, it probably started with <em>The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy</em>\
  \ in all its forms: books, radio play, text adventure, BBC series, and eventually,\
  \ major motion picture. There’s something so relatable about a hapless Earthling\
  \ being thrust into a galactic adventure of stolen spaceships, time travel, and\
  \ bureaucracy. From there, I would find Space Quest (featuring the first space janitor?),\
  \ <em>Red Dwarf </em>(“Everybody’s. Dead. Dave.”), <em>Callahan’s Crosstime Saloon</em>\
  \ (though that series is more a vehicle for puns than anything else), and Futurama\
  \ (best math jokes in the biz!). The goofier episodes of <em>The X-Files</em> and\
  \ <em>Farscape</em> are among my favorite. More recently, <em>Galaxy Quest</em>\
  \ and <em>Lower Decks</em> have taken their shots at that most venerable of sci-fi\
  \ institutions, Star Trek. Much of comedic sci-fi lovingly pokes fun at its own\
  \ genre or points at the foibles of the present through a sci-fi lens. And that’\
  s the kind of influence I try to bring to Starfinder when appropriate. Our iconic\
  \ biohacker hosts a family-friendly science-oriented vidshow that often leads to\
  \ more danger than it should. A group of skittermanders rescue their vesk boss from\
  \ a dangerous massage machine. I love adding those sorts of touches, and I hope\
  \ you enjoy them too! I can’t wait for you to see what’s next!</p> \n      <p style=\"\

  \      </table> \n      <p>My dad got me into science fiction at an early age, with\
  \ Heinlein’s <em>Rocket Ship Galileo</em>. Heinlein wrote a YA science fiction novel\
  \ every year, just in time for Christmas. It was a smart strategy. I don’t know\
  \ how many of those books I read: <em>Have Spacesuit Will Travel</em>, <em>The Star\
  \ Beast</em>, <em>The Moon is a Harsh Mistress</em>. In high school, I had my first\
  \ actual class on science fiction, which introduced me to everything from Asimov\
  \ and John Carter to <em>Riverworld</em> and Chalker’s <em>Well of Souls</em>; predictably,\
  \ my final project was a Well of Souls wargame I designed myself. In fact, by this\
  \ point, my science fiction intake was starting to be determined as much by games\
  \ as by novels; I spent my rainy days pouring over <em>Traveler’s Imperium</em>,\
  \ rolling random mutations in <em>Gamma World</em>, and playing <em>Star Fleet Battles</em>.\
  \ When I got to college, I wandered the campus bookstore looking for stuff I’d never\
  \ heard of before, and that got me to Phil Dick’s <em>Man in the High Castle</em>\
  \ and the <em>Mirrorshades</em> anthology, which broke open the cyberpunk genre.\
  \ It took me a couple of tries to figure out Dune. As a graduate student, I studied\
  \ science fiction under the great and much-missed Dr. George Slusser, curator of\
  \ the University of California Riverside’s Eaton Collection, one of the largest\
  \ collections of SF in the world. One day, on my way out of class, I told Slusser,\
  \ “You know, I want your job.” He said to me, “Stick around here long enough, you\
  \ might get it.” When he passed in 2014, I applied for that gig. I didn’t get it,\
  \ but no regrets. Now, I get to make science fiction instead of curate it, and some\
  \ of the things I’ve made are on the shelves of the Eaton Collection. I’ll take\
  \ that deal.</p> \n      <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold; line-height:\

  \ \n      <br> \n      <p>We’re standing next to each other at a convention. It’\
  s loud and crowded here in the dealer hall, but we’ve identified one another as\
  \ fellow sci-fi nerds; the awkward serendipity when two weirdos recognize each other\
  \ in the wild. We’ve been existing in a pandemic for two years at this point so\
  \ we desperately want to chat with someone new, so we’re eager to start a conversation.\
  \ Our hobby is our common ground, so we start talking about favorite works of sci-fi.\
  \ You list the various novels, video games, and films that first connected you to\
  \ a network of other minds imagining extraordinary realities. I tell you I’m inspired\
  \ by the works of Yoko Taro, Octavia Butler, Toni Morrison, Tade Thompson, and the\
  \ Strugatsky brothers. Then you ask one of those classic icebreaker questions: Which\
  \ Star Trek is your favorite?</p> \n      <table class=\"image\" align=\"left\"\

  \      </table> \n      <p>I shrug. I’m not really into Star Trek, but I watched\
  \ some with my parents growing up. (Star Wars’ western vibe was always more my jam,\
  \ but my dad’s a certified trekkie.) So I tell you that my favorite is Voyager.\
  \ Why? You ask. You’re correctly assuming Captain Janeway has something to do with\
  \ it. We rewind to my childhood. When my parents began watching Voyager, I was an\
  \ awkward girl with scabbed knees and an unflattering bowl cut. During the show’\
  s run, I transformed from invisible tomboy to sullen preteen. I hated my body and\
  \ wasn’t comfortable with the changes puberty was enforcing on it. I didn’t agree\
  \ with everything I saw in the world around me. I was powerless to change anything\
  \ and waiting for my real life to begin. Enter Seven of Nine, a badass with a crisp\
  \ Federation uniform and stylish pixie cut. She was everything I dreamed of becoming.\
  \ In her, I saw the future.</p> \n      <p>But she was more than a childhood role\
  \ model for me. Even though I never watched the entire series, Seven’s narrative\
  \ first sparked my interest in telling stories that explore the definition of humanity\
  \ and the nature of the soul. She was concrete evidence of a feminine person driving\
  \ her own narrative. And there were others like her. Ripley, Sarah Connor, General\
  \ Leia, and (much later) Furiosa became favorite characters and visions of powerful\
  \ femininity, canonized as goddesses in a new pantheon. I expect that of all my\
  \ space heroines, Seven of Nine had the deepest influence on me. </p> \n      <p>Now,\
  \ imagine yourself back in the convention hall. You listen politely to my explanation\
  \ and we gush about our favorite sci-fi characters for few more minutes. I ask you\
  \ another question, maybe about video games, and the ice is broken. We chat for\
  \ a while. We say goodbye and head off to our next destinations, happy to have met\
  \ and befriended a fellow nerd.</p> \n      <p>But, I digress. This is a blog about\
  \ sci-fi in general, not “POV: you meet me at a convention.” Sci-fi works have had\
  \ such an influence on my life, and it’s pretty amazing to be able to call myself\
  \ a sci-fi creator now. When experiencing sci-fi, we can dream of other worlds near\
  \ and far. We can hope for a bright solarpunk future and try to write it into being,\
  \ or examine the great conflicts of our own lives, our fears, our struggles, through\
  \ a lens that allows others to understand us better. Thanks to all of you for your\
  \ interest in other worlds, and expect the aliens, philosophical machines, mechs,\
  \ and space shenanigans to continue. </p> \n      <p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\
