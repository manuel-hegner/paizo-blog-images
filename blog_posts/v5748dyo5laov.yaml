  \ Plan Revealed As Many Local Hunting Dogs Found Dead</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\"\
  >Friday, December 11, 2009</p> \n    <p>Earlier this year, fellow intern Matt and\
  \ I were invited to begin playing in a Pathfinder RPG game run by local resident\
  \ Crystal Frasier. We accepted, and Matt, Ross Byers (later to leave us for reasons\
  \ involving Will saves and girl-cooties), and I began our quest to become... <i>The\
  \ Stuff of Legends</i>. Deciding to make my life difficult, I made Klar, the burly\
  \ and buff bluffing bard, Matt rolled up Zirithanis the hobo druid and Destroyer-of-Worlds-Fetcher-of-Dreams-Maxwell,\
  \ his longtime friend and goblin-hating murderous dog of war, while Ross Byers began\
  \ his quest as the excessive sorcerer, Aurelis. Our team assembled, <i>The Stuff\
  \ of Legends</i>' first dabble into adventuring follows.</p> \n    <p>Meeting with\
  \ the mayor, we understood that we were to stop mysterious sabotage attempts on\
  \ a hopeful resort town in the Varisian Gulf. Naturally, our business powwow was\
  \ interrupted by screams: Goblins had invaded the bathhouse! Having studied Goblinoid\
  \ languages in a Chelish Opera College, I tried to negotiate with them, but their\
  \ crude language and dubious use of the honorifics \"dog-lover\" and \"ugly-face,\"\
  \ made communication difficult. While I eventually gained their trust, my inquiries\
  \ into why they would invade a bathhouse were met with confusion over failed translations\
  \ of the words \"bath,\" \"clean,\" \"soap,\" and \"hot water.\" They began to suspect\
  \ that I wanted to cook them, eventually leading us to armed conflict.</p> \n  \
  \  <p> After Maxwell the Dog dispatched two of the goblins (Aurelis proved his worth\
  \ as an electric stove, cooking one with <i>shocking grasp</i>), we entered the\
  \ bathhouse, only to be ambushed again! Two stirges and a goblin sniper were difficult\
  \ foes, yet, with the ever-suspect \"oh, are you still singing?\" of bardsong, Maxwell\
  \ destroyed all opposition. Afterward, finding the public bath infested with vipers,\
  \ we left them for the town's pest control. When we later realized that was Zirithanis'\
  \ job, we went back and he charmed them into a wicker basket and left them at the\
  \ edge of town. When we later heard a picnicker was killed by vipers, we blamed\
  \ Zirithanis.</p> \n    <p> However, being playtest time, an unexpected enemy followed\
  \ us into town: the Goblin Oracle! She was one of the most feared enemies we have\
  \ ever fought, especially since we lacked Aurelis's help (he was sleeping off breakfast\
  \ in his 100-gp suite on the coast). Perhaps it was her big hat, or maybe the threat\
  \ of goblin rash from her two mangy rat-dogs, or maybe her fury over the sacked\
  \ child she took hostage that was greased out of her hands, but the strength of\
  \ her unusually fearsome blows felled both Zirithanis and me at different points.\
  \ Our leapfrog healing tactics took her by surprise, however, keeping us both in\
  \ the fight. In the end, Maxwell the Dog killed her, jumping over a mountain, stopping\
  \ a flood by barking, and then arriving home in time to snap her neck and take the\
  \ glory for himself. Next: Maxwell Defeats Giant Wheeled Eidolon and Eats It.</p>\
