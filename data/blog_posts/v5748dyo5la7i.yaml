  \ What Icing Is to Cake</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Monday, April 23, 2007</p>\
  \ \n    <p>I've made no secret of my obsession for new monsters. I love them. I\
  \ can never get enough of them. Will I ever use all the monsters I've collected\
  \ through my decades of RPG enthusiasm? Absolutely not. But I wouldn't give up any\
  \ of them.</p> \n    <p>Unlike magic items or spells, new monsters are things that\
  \ a GM can introduce into a game without fear that they'll disrupt a campaign. If\
  \ they prove too lame (as was the case of my home campaign's flying, slavering eraduâ€”\
  a sort of warthog-shark intended to be the \"new bulette,\" but who ended up being\
  \ glass-jawed, one-hit loser), it's easy enough to never use them again. But once\
  \ your PCs get your hands on things like new spells and new magic items, it's much\
  \ harder to back them out of the campaign without a lot of tears and thrown dice.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>With <i>Pathfinder</i>, we're embracing the new monster completely. Every\
  \ volume will feature a bestiary that spotlights roughly six new monsters. Some\
  \ of them will have roles in that month's adventure while others might just be there\
  \ to add flavor to our new campaign setting. A few might even be previews of an\
  \ Adventure Path years down the road. Some will be drawn from real-world myth, some\
  \ from cryptozoological reports, and some wholly from the minds of our authors.\
  \ Hopefully we'll all have some new favorite monsters in the months to come!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>But talking about monsters isn't enough. We don't have art in yet for\
  \ the six new monsters that are going to be in the first volume of <i>Pathfinder</i>\
  \ to support the first adventure, \"Burnt Offerings,\" but we do have descriptions\
  \ of them. And while names of these monsters are placeholders in many cases, their\
  \ descriptions are locked in. Check them out! (Warning: as with most of these blogs,\
  \ spoilers below!)</p> \n    <h2>Attic Whisperer</h2> \n    <p>This undead thing\
  \ resembles a child's skeleton with the paws and grinning skull of a fox. It is\
  \ gray and covered with cobwebs, and dust falls endlessly from its mouth. It holds\
  \ a ragged stuffed child's toy, its eyes pierced by pins, in its skeletal, fox-like\
  \ hands. The creature is dressed in a small sleeping gown that looks like it was\
  \ partially burned in a fire, as if it were the remains of a child who had died\
  \ in bed. </p> \n    <h2>Giant Gecko</h2> \n    <p>There are two breeds of giant\
  \ gecko in Varisia. The first is the size of a small horse or pony, maybe 8 feet\
  \ long from head to tail. His eyes are bright blue and his body brightly colored.\
  \ His open mouth holds hundreds of fangs, and his feet have large flat toes.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The second breed is much larger and more muscular, running about 14 feet\
  \ long from snout to tail tip. This gecko has horns and a ridge of spines running\
  \ down its back. Its eyes are bright red, and green smoking drool drips from its\
  \ mouth, indication of its venomous bite.</p> \n    <h2>Goblin Dog</h2> \n    <p>While\
  \ goblins ride worgs, wolves, and giant geckos when they can get them, most goblins\
  \ are stuck with these disturbing mounts. Shaped like a limber greyhound but with\
  \ a feral, ratlike face and tail, goblin dogs share their masters' hatred of real\
  \ dogs. Their front two paws are tiny, black, ratlike hands, and their attitudes\
  \ are all snarls and froth.</p> \n    <h2>Goblin Snake</h2> \n    <p>This strange\
  \ snakelike monster is about 6 feet long and coiled around the roots of a tree that\
  \ hang down from the roof of a cave. The snake has a black body with a thin racing\
  \ stripe down its flank. Its back is a ridge of tiny horns. Its head is actually\
  \ that of a goblin, but with a forked tongue and no ears. It has wide white snake\
  \ eyes and a large mouth with two large viper fangs in the front. Some sages hold\
  \ that goblin snakes are atrophied, deformed nagas, while most goblins believe that\
  \ they're reincarnated heroes sent back to this world to punish goblin enemies.</p>\
  \ \n    <h2>Runespawn</h2> \n    <p>Humanoid but deformed, the runespawn is an emaciated\
  \ horror with unnaturally long arms and legs. Its hands each have two talon-tipped\
  \ fingers and a thumb, and their legs bend like those of a dog. It's dressed in\
  \ tatters and rags that expose much of its skin; veins bulge all over their bodies,\
  \ forming dark blue or red patterns that look like twisted runes. Their flesh is\
  \ pale and hairless. The runespawn's heads are curiously elongated. They have only\
  \ a pair of slits for a nose, and their eyes are bulging and red, with no visible\
  \ eyebrows. Yet for all this horror, their mouths are the most disturbing, for their\
  \ lower jaw splits in half at the chin into pedipalps that end in tiny three-fingered\
  \ hands that writhe about, eager to feed delicious morsels into an open gullet with\
  \ a lolling tongue.</p> \n    <h2>Sandpoint Devil</h2> \n    <p>This critter is\
  \ heavily inspired by the northeastern U.S. legend of the Jersey Devil. The Sandpoint\
  \ version of this monster is a horrible horse-like creature with a fang-filled mouth,\
  \ large bat wings, and a reptilian tail. Rumored to have been birthed by a woman\
  \ cursed by Lamashtu, goddess of monsters and madness, the Sandpoint Devil is one\
  \ of the most famous local legends. Despite long-standing rewards for its capture,\
  \ it has never been caught. But when hunters and travelers go missing, chances are\
  \ you'll hear tell that the Sandpoint Devil got them.</p> \n    <p>James Jacobs<br>\
