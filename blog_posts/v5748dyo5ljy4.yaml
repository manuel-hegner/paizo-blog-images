  \ and Hacking in Starfinder</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Friday, July 7, 2017</p>\
  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"> \n    <p>So let's just put it out there: Like\
  \ many RPGs set in a universe with advanced technology, Starfinder has rules for\
  \ computers, and hacking computers. And, like nearly all RPGs that do so, these\
  \ rules aren't grounded in reality.</p> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">There\
  \ are lots of good reasons for this, ranging from no one working on the game being\
  \ an accredited IT security expert, to real-world computer issues often being slow,\
  \ boring, and not the sort of thing we particularly want to have Starfinder stories\
  \ focus on. Just as in Pathfinder we do not require people to be able to write in\
  \ (or even identify) iambic pentameter to be able to use the Perform skill or have\
  \ any archery skills at all to take Rapid Shot, we want people with no particular\
  \ computer knowledge to be comfortable with the Computers skill (and the devices\
  \ it works with) in Starfinder.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\">\n     <a href=\"\

  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>So, here are there basics. There is a Computers skill,\
  \ which at its most basic is defined as the ability to operate, manipulate, and\
  \ hack into computer systems. It's Intelligence based, cannot be used untrained\
  \ (though there is an exception), and is a class skill for envoys, mechanics, operatives\
  \ and technomancers. If you have access to a computer system's physical interface,\
  \ you don't need any other tools, but if not you need a hacking kit to attempt to\
  \ interact with a system.</p> \n    <p>If a computer is unsecured, a DC 10 Computers\
  \ check allows you to use its most basic functions, and unlike other Computers skill\
  \ tasks this can be done untrained if you take 20, so normally it isn't an issue\
  \ unless you're in a hurry. If a computer is secured, there are tasks you can perform\
  \ with the skill, all of which are built around defining computers with tiers, modules,\
  \ and systems.</p> \n    <p>Computers themselves are defined in their own section\
  \ in the equipment chapter. In general, a computer has an item level equal to double\
  \ its tier. A tier 1 computer might be something as simple as a common datapad,\
  \ while a tier 10 computer may be running an entire space station or handling major\
  \ systems for a large company. Beyond its tier, a computer is defined by its size,\
  \ user interface, access and authorization, basic function, modules (which define\
  \ what the computer can do or control beyond its basic functions, and may include\
  \ controlling other devices or computers), and countermeasures.</p> \n    <p>Computers\
  \ skill checks have DCs based on the tier and countermeasures of the computer they\
  \ are applied to, and generally take one round per tier of the computer. If you\
  \ hack a computer and beat the DC to do so by 20, you gain root access, and can\
  \ use the computer with no further checks. (And if you buy or build a computer,\
  \ it comes with root access for you.) Otherwise, each module or system you attempt\
  \ to manipulate requires its own check. As might be expected, there are various\
  \ modifiers, special abilities, and tool kits that can affect this base system,\
  \ but at its core the Computers skill allows a character to at least attempt anything\
  \ software- or hardware-related that an adventuring character is likely to need\
  \ to deal with.</p> \n    <p>The rules for computers also allow players to design\
  \ and buy or build their own. Most starships are also assumed to have a computer\
  \ with a tier equal to half the starship's tier, which can also be upgraded to help\
  \ operate various ship systems. A computer can have upgrades or countermeasures\
  \ installed to grant it new capabilities, make it more resistant to hacking, increase\
  \ its battery life, and so on. Below is a preview of part of one common upgrade,\
  \ the artificial personality.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <h3>Artificial Personality</h3>\
  \ \n     <p><i>An artificial personality is a program designed to allow a computer\
  \ to hold conversations in plain language with both users and creatures that lack\
  \ access. Such computers are often given a name and are capable of parsing expressions,\
  \ slang, social cues, tone of voice, and similar elements beyond a literal understanding\
  \ of spoken or written words. They can respond appropriately through algorithms\
  \ and lists of billions of known phrases and expressions, developed by programmers\
  \ over centuries to allow for extremely natural-sounding conversations. Such computers\
  \ can even display what appear to be emotions and insights. However, unlike androids,\
  \ computers with artificial personalities have not attained true consciousness.\
  \ The ability of an artificial personality to hold a conversation, learn names and\
  \ habits, and even give advice is based purely on its complex code and extensive\
  \ lexicons.</i></p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Owen KC Stephens<br> <i>Developer</i></p>\
