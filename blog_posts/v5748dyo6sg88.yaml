  \ a new version of Pathfinder. It's been over three weeks since we got underway\
  \ by encouraging everyone to play Part 1 of <i>Doomsday Dawn. </i>And play you did!\
  \ The outpouring of survey responses from those who completed \"The Lost Star\"\
  \ (Part 1) has truly been overwhelming. We've learned a lot about the game, but\
  \ there's still so much to explore! That is why, today, we're moving our focus to\
  \ Part 2 of <i>Doomsday Dawn</i>, titled \"In Pale Mountain's Shadow.\"</p> \n \
  \    <p>Before we move on, I want to stress that while we're shifting focus to Part\
  \ 2, it's still not too late for you to contribute to the surveys for Part 1 (which\
  \ you can find links to at pathfinderplaytest.com). We'll be keeping those surveys\
  \ open until the end of the year, and the results will be checked regularly as we\
  \ continue to analyze the data.</p> \n     <h2>In Pale Mountain's Shadow</h2> \n\
  \     <p>Starting today, we want to encourage everyone to play Part 2 of <i>Doomsday\
  \ Dawn</i>. Your GM will have all the details you need to create characters for\
  \ this adventure. You heard me correctlyâ€”you'll need to make new characters for\
  \ this part of the adventure. Don't throw away those sheets from Part 1 just yet,\
  \ though; we might revisit characters throughout this process.</p> \n     <p>Once\
  \ you've played through the adventure, we once again have surveys for you to fill\
  \ out to give us a sense of what everyone is playing and how the game is performing\
  \ in this new adventure. You can find the surveys at the links below:</p> \n   \
  \  <p><a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/PFPlaytestP2PC\">Player Survey</a><br>\
  \ <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/PFPlaytestP2GM\">GM Survey</a><br> <a\
  \ href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/PFPlaytestP2Op\">Open Response Survey</a></p>\
  \ \n     <p>Please note that just like last time, these surveys are ONLY for participants\
  \ who have completed Part 2 of <i>Doomsday Dawn</i>. Also, please ensure that you\
  \ complete all four pages of the Player Survey or GM Survey, since if you don't\
  \ complete the survey, it'll end up not being counted.</p> \n     <h2>Updates to\
  \ Death and Dying</h2> \n     <p>Before you begin your playthrough, we highly encourage\
  \ you to grab the newest version of the Pathfinder Playtest Update document. Inside\
  \ you'll find a host of changes to the game, as well as a revision to the Death\
  \ and Dying rules, which we made based on feedback from the first round of the playtest.\
  \ Make sure to incorporate these changes before you play your next game so you're\
  \ playtesting the latest version of the system.</p> \n     <h2>Results from The\
  \ Lost Star</h2> \n     <p>In case you missed it, we ran a stream on the Paizo Twitch\
  \ channel on Friday, called Doomsday Dawn Deconstructed, in which we explored some\
  \ of the survey results from Part 1 of <i>Doomsday Dawn</i>. Here are just a few\
  \ of the highlights from the surveys (mild spoilers ahead).</p> \n     <ul> \n \
  \     <li><b>Ancestry: </b>Of the characters made for Part 1, humans were the most\
  \ common (around 25%), followed by elves and goblins (around 15%) and dwarves (around\
  \ 12%). The other ancestries were around 6-8% each.</li> \n      <li><b>Class:</b>\
  \ Cleric, fighter, and rogue were the most common choice for class (around 12% each).\
  \ Most others fell between 6-9%.</li> \n      <li><b>Dying:</b> Around 6% of characters\
  \ were killed in Part 1 of <i>Doomsday Dawn</i>, with clerics dying the most often\
  \ (probably due to no one being able to heal the group's only healer).</li> \n \
  \     <li><b>Trivia:</b> 3 characters elected to venerate Asmodeus. 34 decided to\
  \ drink from the polluted fountain. Fewer than 1 in 8 alchemists completely expended\
  \ their ability to use Resonance Points during the adventure. Monks had the most\
  \ coin left over after creation, at 64 sp.</li> \n     </ul> \n     <p>There's so\
  \ much more for us to learn from this playtest, and we're truly grateful to all\
  \ of you that have taken the time to play our game and give us your feedback. We're\
  \ looking forward to seeing more as we get underway with Part 2. Good luck at your\
  \ next game!</p> \n     <p>Jason Bulmahn<br> <i>Director of Game Design</i></p>\
