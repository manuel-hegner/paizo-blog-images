  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">by Dave Gross</p> \n   <h2>Chapter Three: The Second Duel</h2>\
  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p>Vencarlo Orisini tried to draw his\
  \ rapier, but I lunged forward to strike the pommel and thrust it back into its\
  \ scabbard. \"Stop this nonsense at once!\"</p> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\"\
  >Vencarlo retreated, turning to free his blade. I stepped behind him, pulling the\
  \ scabbard and sword out of his grasp.</span></p> \n    <p>\"Orkatto, see Lady Seraphina\
  \ safely away.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I'll go with them,\" Cucuteni said, all too eager\
  \ to escape the quarrel erupting between me and my bodyguard. That was just as well.\
  \ I desired no witnesses to my chastising my servant.</p> \n    <p>\"I won't let\
  \ you take Blackjack,\" snapped Vencarlo. Once more he danced away, trying to draw\
  \ his blade. Once more I danced after him, thrusting my arm through the crook of\
  \ his elbow to prevent him from reaching the blade.</p> \n    <p>\"Calm yourself,\"\
  \ I told him. \"The trap is already sprung. Even now, the Korvosan guard are surrounding\
  \ the thief.\"</p> \n    <p>\"He's a hero! You would know that if you ever stepped\
  \ out of that Red Carriage and walked among the people.\" Vencarlo feinted right\
  \ before twisting left. With my hand upon his arm, I felt his muscles tense. Anticipating\
  \ his movement, I circled him, lifting his sword arm as if to allow him a turn.\
  \ Instead, I drew his sword from its scabbard.</p> \n    <p>I stepped back, smiling\
  \ as I showed that I had taken his blade with my left hand. He smiled back at me,\
  \ tossing my own rapier from his left hand to his right. He saluted me with my own\
  \ blade.</p> \n    <p>\"Whichever of us survives this night must thank Master Raneiro\
  \ for that trick.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Beware, Vencarlo. I have learned many others\
  \ since leaving the master's tutelage,\" I said. \"And you have only just begun\
  \ learning from him.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Blackjack!\" Surprising me, Vencarlo ran toward\
  \ the east wing of the museum. \"They have set a trap for you!\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Stop this at once!\" I ran after him.</p> \n    <p>The museum curator, my cousin,\
  \ had ordered only the foyer fully lighted for the evening's reception of Queen\
  \ Domina and Prince Eodred. In the east wing, only a few perpetual flame spells\
  \ illuminated the sign reading \"Local Legends,\" and I spied similarly muted lights\
  \ throughout the gloomy halls. I had not yet visited the latest exhibit upon this\
  \ visit to Korvosa. With luck, neither had Vencarlo, so we would be equally disadvantaged\
  \ in the darkness.</p> \n    <p>Chasing after my disobedient servant, I stopped\
  \ short as a hideous beast rose up before me. At my approach, an auditory spell\
  \ unleashed a horrible whinny as a pair of enormous wings flapped at my approach.\
  \ After a moment's uncertainty, I recognized it as the Sandpoint Devil.</p> \n \
  \   <p>Some disreputable \"naturalist\" had stitched together this patchwork falsity\
  \ from the preserved corpses of a stallion, a crocodile, and a dire bat. Later I\
  \ would have to speak to my cousin about this penchant for the tawdry and sensational.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Movement drew my eye past another exhibit, this one featuring a gruesome\
  \ waxwork of a local murderess. From the angle, I could not make out what was written\
  \ on the magically illuminated placard beneath the diorama. I leaped the low picket\
  \ fence surrounding the murder house. \"Vencarlo, come back here! I cannot ensure\
  \ your safety if you interfere with the guards.\"</p> \n    <p>The bravo's laugh\
  \ echoed through the darkened exhibits. I followed the sound, uncertain of its origin.\
  \ Rounding a tableau of a lone elven archer fighting a goblin tribe, I found myself\
  \ facing a masked man. The blade of his rapier glimmered in the dim enchanted light.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Without a thought, my body assumed the guard position. \"Surrender yourself,\"\
  \ I said. \"Upon my word as a count of Cheliax, you will face justice for your crimes.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>My foe stood silent and still. From the far end of the eastern wing\
  \ came a shout and a flurry of footsteps.</p> \n    <p>A moment of doubt caused\
  \ me to hesitate, but then I beat the man's blade with my own. It turned aside,\
  \ and with it the waxwork imposter before me. Glancing around, I saw no witness\
  \ to my folly—a small consolation. </p> \n    <p>I snatched up the brazier of perpetual\
  \ flames beneath the placard and held them closer to the wax figure. It was indeed\
  \ a depiction of the notorious thief, cloaked and cowled in black, a mask concealing\
  \ his lower face. But at its feet the placard read \"Blackjack, Hero of South Shore.\"\
  \ The rest of the tableau showed the figure standing before a woman and child in\
  \ rags, defending them from a pair of Sczarni cutthroats at the command of a sneering\
  \ landlord holding a fat purse.</p> \n    <p>A rope creaked above me. I held the\
  \ flames high to see another figure of the rogue swinging across the blackened gunwales\
  \ of a sailing ship with a frightened cabin boy under one arm. This one lacked the\
  \ mask of the first, and beneath him a wide-brimmed hat lay on the ground. A sign\
  \ hanging beside the figure read, \"Savior of the Lady Luck.\"</p> \n    <p>Another\
  \ exhibit depicted a grizzled Blackjack leaping from the back of one tentacled hulk\
  \ to plunge his sword through the maw of another. I knew of the incident in which\
  \ the creatures sometimes referred to as \"sewer hulks\" rampaged through the city.\
  \ It had occurred nearly thirty years earlier. The legend read, \"Hero of Old Korvosa.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Vencarlo, wait!\" As much as I wanted to prevent him from interfering\
  \ with my trap, I now also wanted an explanation. How could a man so reviled by\
  \ my peers be presented by my own cousin as a hero in a museum? I needed to know\
  \ more before I could—</p> \n    <p>\"He's here!\" cried a man from the far end\
  \ of the hall. The silhouettes of four men ran into the room, toward me.</p> \n\
  \    <p>On a catwalk above us, a cloaked figure laughed back at them. \"You fools\
  \ will never catch me!\" cried a voice I recognized despite his attempts to deepen\
  \ it. \"You will never catch Blackjack!\"</p> \n    <p>The voice belonged Vencarlo\
  \ Orisini. The evidence of his deception hung above me in the form of the unmasked\
  \ waxwork, whose disguise he had obviously stolen. Yet in the darkness his disguise\
  \ was more than enough to draw off the guards.</p> \n    <p>Holding the perpetual\
  \ flames above my head, I called out to the guards. \"It's a trick. He's leading\
  \ you away from the real Blackjack.\"</p> \n    <p>Even as I said the words, I debated\
  \ with myself whether to reveal Vencarlo's ruse. The guards arrived before I had\
  \ time to decide.</p> \n    <p>They were not Korvosan guards. I did not recognize\
  \ their uniforms, and their coarse expressions and unshaven cheeks suggested hired\
  \ rather than sworn men. They held the points of their blades toward me as they\
  \ approached.</p> \n    <p>\"What is the meaning—?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Stand down,\
  \ men. That is Count Jeggare, an ally.\" Gaspare Orkatto pushed past them, face\
  \ glistening with sweat. \"Did you see him, Your Excellency?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Who\
  \ are these men, Gaspare? I instructed you to use the city guard.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  You did, of course you did,\" he said, once more waving his fingers beside his cheek\
  \ in that nervous gesture of his. \"But I thought it better to enlist my own men.\
  \ If Blackjack is as clever as they say, he might notice if some of the Korvosan\
  \ guard were off the streets tonight.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I also asked you to look\
  \ after Lady Seraphina.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Oh, she is quite safe. I saw her and Lord\
  \ Cucuteni out of the museum before joining the pursuit. Did you see him? Did he\
  \ come this way?\"</p> \n    <p> \"It wasn't—\" Another motion caught my eye, this\
  \ one behind Orkatto and his men. A graceful figure moved between a pair of Shoanti\
  \ shaman waxworks, discernible only in the moment when it passed between me and\
  \ one of the perpetual flames spells. I pointed back toward the foyer. \"He went\
  \ that way!\"</p> \n    <p>With a curse, Vencarlo ran across the catwalk, leading\
  \ Orkatto and his guards out of the east wing. As they departed, I moved in the\
  \ opposite direction, toward the silent intruder.</p> \n    <p>\"Show yourself,\
  \ Blackjack.\" I lowered the point of my blade and peered into the darkness where\
  \ I knew he must be hiding. My half-elven vision revealed nothing more than the\
  \ flickering shadows. </p> \n    <p>I felt the prick of his rapier's tip against\
  \ my back. By enchantment or uncanny knack, he moved as swift and silent as a ghost.\
  \ The moment he spoke, I recognized the liquid tones of his voice. \"You have been\
  \ ill used, Your Excellency.\"</p> \n    <p>I turned, confident he would not strike\
  \ me from behind. \"So it would appear, Master Raneiro.\" </p> \n    <div class=\"\

  ></a>\n     <br>Raneiro is a master of the blade—and so much more.\n    </div> \n\
  \    <p>The masked figure nodded. Now that I had heard his voice, I recognized the\
  \ line of his chin, the faint stubble upon his skin. He motioned in the direction\
  \ the hired men had gone. \"You have noticed there are no Korvosan guards within\
  \ the museum?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Of course, but too late to understand Orkatto's intention.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"He means to kill me, not to bring me before a magistrate.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Why?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Have you not already deduced his reason? What\
  \ do you think I do with the jewelry I liberate from the parasites on this city?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>I thought of the tableaux surrounding us, and of Orkatto's recent\
  \ travails. \"The tenants of South Shore. You have been paying their rent.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Very good,\" said Raneiro. \"But as you said, too late.\"</p> \n  \
  \  <p>\"They are chasing after Vencarlo. You must leave before they discover the\
  \ ruse.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Without the jewels?\" Raneiro chuckled. \"I think you underestimate\
  \ our local hero.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Does Vencarlo know?\"</p> \n    <p>Raneiro shrugged.\
  \ \"He suspects. He is cleverer than he sometimes appears, and twice as skilled\
  \ with the blade. One day he will take over his father's academy, once he learns\
  \ to guard his tongue in political matters.\"</p> \n    <p>\"And your mask? Will\
  \ he take that as well?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Perhaps one day. Blackjack is more than\
  \ a man. He is a legend that must never die.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I will not help you\
  \ steal the jewels. But if you leave them, I will do everything in my power to ensure\
  \ your safe escape—and Vencarlo's.\"</p> \n    <p>\"How generous,\" Raneiro said,\
  \ his tone just short of sarcasm. Once more the tip of his blade pricked me, this\
  \ time above the heart. \"But I must decline your charity. Blackjack does not beg\
  \ for scraps. He recovers what the lords of Korvosa have stolen from the people.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>With a quick retreat, I raised my guard just in time to parry his\
  \ thrust—or so I thought. Raneiro bent his blade as its tip found its intended target,\
  \ a brass button upon my breast. Had he intended it, he would have driven his blade\
  \ through my heart.</p> \n    <p>From the far reaches of the museum, alarums rose\
  \ and subsided into the clamor of a chase. Above the shouts of Orkatto's men rose\
  \ a mocking laugh.</p> \n    <p>\"His laugh is quite good,\" said Raneiro. \"Don't\
  \ you agree?\"</p> \n    <p>\"I cannot allow you steal the jewels,\" I repeated.\
  \ \"But I promise to safeguard your identity.\"</p> \n    <p>\"You make the same\
  \ mistake as the local lords, my old friend,\" said Raneiro. \"It is no longer for\
  \ you to ‘allow.' The people of Korvosa will gladly toil for their bread, but they\
  \ will not abandon their homes to feed the avarice of men like Orkatto.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>My blade licked out twice, a feint and an adder's strike upon his arm—a\
  \ Taldan attack, one I hoped Raneiro had never seen. He parried it without effort,\
  \ and his riposte sent me into a retreating Elliendo defense.</p> \n    <p>He smiled\
  \ to see me pressed.</p> \n    <p>My retreating heel struck the base of another\
  \ exhibit. I froze as the claw of a stuffed owl-beast appeared beside my head. For\
  \ an instant I thought of the cliffs of Lepidstadt and the stand I had made against\
  \ my fellow students one drunken night. But then I had not faced a master of the\
  \ blade.</p> \n    <p>I could not continue to defend myself in such a tight spot.\
  \ Turning my latest parry into a bind, I dipped beneath the preserved beast's arm\
  \ and rolled across the open aisle. As I came up to one knee, I saw by his silhouette\
  \ that Raneiro had anticipated my move. His blade was fixed upon my eye, his rear\
  \ leg poised to lunge, his mouth a grim line of regret and determination.</p> \n\
  \    <p>A metallic hiss preceded a dull impact. Raneiro straightened, the point\
  \ of his sword dipping. His free hand moved with aching slowness to feel his back.\
  \ He coughed out a single syllable, \"Ah.\"</p> \n    <p>A lithe figure crouched\
  \ behind him. A chain dangled from one leather-clad hand, a dripping dart swinging\
  \ pendulously below. Shrouded eyes caught mine from beneath a deep cowl, but only\
  \ for an instant before the assassin dashed into the shadows.</p> \n    <p>I moved\
  \ to pursue, but then Raneiro dropped his blade and fell to one knee. I went to\
  \ him and felt the wound. Tasting a familiar poison in his blood, I knew his fate.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Master, let me get you out of here.\"</p> \n    <p>At the tone of my\
  \ voice, he too knew his fate. \"Yes,\" he said, his voice already weakening. \"\
  Find me a quiet place to die.\"</p> \n    <p align=\"center\"><b>Coming Next Week</b>:\
