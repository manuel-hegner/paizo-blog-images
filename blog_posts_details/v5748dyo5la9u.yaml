  artist: "Jason Engle is the black jinn, a spiteful being of elemental fury; these\
    \ creatures will harm mortals if they can. Vadid and Nahk Preview Purloiners Thought\
    \ by many, even among the jann, to be myths and dark legends, the black jinn are\
    \ an accursed and forgotten tribe of genies. Bearers of ill will and bringers\
    \ of destruction upon both mortals and their own kind, these living ill omens\
    \ are hateful creatures possessed by madness and a drive to call down ruin upon\
    \ any who intrude upon their desolate sanctums. The few black jinn encountered\
    \ on the Material Plane are thought of as terrors of the deep desert, arriving\
    \ in sudden sandstorms, brilliant with electrical fury, and disappearing just\
    \ as quickly to leave behind no trace of lost comrades or merely corpses, charred\
    \ or glazed in molten glass. Largely, black jinn are creatures of myth and legend,\
    \ but a handful of mortals know the terrible truth which few live long enough\
    \ to tell"
