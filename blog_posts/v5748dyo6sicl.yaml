  \ with Fola Barun and touring the Grand Lodge was a handsome man with tattoos and\
  \ <em>gorgeous</em> hair. Rumor is his name is Taiwalei and he hails from around\
  \ the Okaiyo Ocean. He’s been seen by a number of different agents shadowing venture-captains\
  \ and talking about leadership strategies, while also discussing the Maze of the\
  \ Open Road and its recent weird fluctuations. The most fascinating part, however,\
  \ is that he seems to be juggling the attentions of both Fola and our own Mr. Available,\
  \ Eando Kline! Who knows what that could bring come springtime?</p> \n     <div\

  \ appearing around the Grand Lodge? A djinni! Safa hails from Qadira, though according\
  \ to my sources, they’ve traveled as far as Jalmeray and, of course, all over the\
  \ Plane of Air! They showed up accompanied by Venture-Captain Esmayl ibn Qaradi—\
  no confirmation of romance between the two yet! Apparently, Safa recently saw the\
  \ end of a terrible genie-binding (good riddance, I say!) and is taking the time\
  \ to explore the Pathfinder Society and see what we’re all about. Rumor is that\
  \ they’re planning a trip out to Jalmeray soon and plan to act as leadership for\
  \ some Pathfinders. Looks like our venture-captains are about to get a breath of\
  \ fresh air!</p> \n     <p>That’s all I’ve seen so far! Tune in next month when\
  \ I go undercover to discover <em>who</em> Gorm has been visiting every Fireday,\
  \ <em>what</em> exactly is written in Kreighton’s secret journals, when we’ll see\
  \ an update from Sorrina’s new experiments, <em>where</em> the Waterfall has been\
  \ buying all of her dresses, and <em>why</em> I can’t seem to get into Ambrus’s\
  \ quarters anymore!</p> \n     <p>With adoration,<br> Your Beloved Venture-Gossip</p>\
