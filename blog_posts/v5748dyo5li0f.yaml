  \ again for last week's excellent <a href=\"http://paizo.com/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lhzh?Hawkmoons-Best-Character-Ever-Sajan\"\
  >Best Character Ever blog</a>, even though he was almost completely wrong. If you've\
  \ got a pitch for a blog, hit us up at pacg@paizo.com!</p> \n     <p itemprop=\"\
  description\">Now, let’s talk monks. The design team loves to talk about what makes\
  \ a monk a monk. Is it a desire for self-perfection and superior discipline? Ridiculous\
  \ aerial gymnastics? The ability to punch something really, really hard? Nobody\
  \ was willing to admit that one of these qualities was clearly more important than\
  \ the other two, so we just used all three. Let’s meet the band!</p> \n     <h2>Birdwoman,\
  \ or (The Unexpected Virtue of Wing Nuance)</h2> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ></a>\n      <br> <em>Fun fact: the design team immediately nicknamed this character\
  \ “Rooboocoop” after I named her. These are the people I <strike>have</strike> get\
  \ to work with.</em>\n     </div> \n     <p>First up is Rooboo, a tengu monk. As\
  \ anyone who’s played Skull &amp; Shackles through knows, tengu are Pathfinder’\
  s bird people. You’ve seen the Tengu Rookery and the Jinx Eater, but never a tengu\
  \ character.</p> \n     <p>My favorite thing about Rooboo is her avian power suite.\
  \ She can fly away from situations she can’t handle, and, like a magpie, she’s good\
  \ at grabbing shiny things. Movement is a bit of a thing with her, as you can see\
  \ from her Flowing Monk role. Move twice on a turn? No problem. Dance away from\
  \ trouble? Ain’t nothin’. She can even blow her allies out of harm’s way with some\
  \ downdraft action.</p> \n     <p>You’ll also notice she has a very unusual combat\
  \ power. We’ll get to that later.</p> \n     <h2>When Your Fist/Elbow/Knee/Foot\
  \ is a Hammer...</h2> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6809-AthnulFront.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6809-AthnulFront_180.jpeg\"></a> <a\

  ></a>\n      <br> <em>You may make the first strike. I shall make the last.</em>\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>Athnul, named after a character I played in a campaign long\
  \ ago, brings some old-school martial arts to the party. She’s a bare-handed terror\
  \ who takes Runelords Sajan’s unarmed strike and gives it a twist. She’s not here\
  \ to overcome barriers. Athnul is here to punch things until they die.</p> \n  \
  \   <p>Her Keen Strike Monk role is based on an archetype from <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9daq?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Inner-Sea-Races-Hardcover\"\
  ><em>Inner Sea Races</em></a> called the Hamatulatsu Master. This version of Athnul\
  \ is about finding the most effective way to cause pain, and she’s willing to help\
  \ her party members do the same. As a side note, I’m very fond of adding a little\
  \ support to a primarily self-sufficient character. This is a co-op game, after\
  \ all, and hybrid characters can show people the fun in playing a different kind\
  \ of character than the type they usually select. This Athnul also gains some spell-like\
  \ abilities, as represented by the Divine skill feat.</p> \n     <h2>Kamas and Rochins\
  \ and Temple Swords, Oh My</h2> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"\

  ></a>\n      <br> <em>Who's the best character now?</em>\n     </div> \n     <p>We’\
  ve also created a new version of our iconic monk Sajan for this deck, affectionately\
  \ referred to in-house as Stabby Sajan. As you can see, he’s interested in weapons\
  \ that have the Slashing trait, and he’s got a variant of his original blessing-recharge\
  \ power that’s got a little more kick to it. This Sajan is rarely without the means\
  \ to defend himself. Those who guard the temple don’t go unnoticed by the gods.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>We wouldn’t give you a Sajan that wants weapons and then leave you with\
  \ only a wellspring of resentment. Instead, we’ve created more than 10 new weapons\
  \ in this deck, including a fancier temple sword or two.</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  ></a>\n      <br> <em>Time to bust out your war fan katas!</em>\n     </div> \n\
  \     <p>These new temple swords use the Strength/Dexterity/Melee listing you might\
  \ remember from the <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy98sw?Pathfinder-Battles-Iconic-Heroes-Set-1\"\
  ><em>Iconic Heroes</em></a> promo card, while the bulk of the new weapons in this\
  \ class deck allow characters with the Acrobatics skill to show off a little. Any\
  \ character with the Acrobatics skill can make use of these, so the <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy97id?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Class-Deck-Rogue\"\
  >Rogue Class Deck</a>’s Wu Shen and the <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy97ie/discuss?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Class-Deck-Sorcerer\"\
  >Sorcerer Class Deck</a>’s Amaryllis just got a little love. (For a peek into the\
  \ design crystal ball, consider what other sorts of characters might use such weapons.)</p>\
  \ \n     <p>That’s it for this week. Next week, Paul Peterson returns with the goods\
  \ on Wrath of the Righteous’s <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9dao?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Wrath-of-the-Righteous-Adventure-Deck-5-Herald-of-the-Ivory-Labyrinth\"\
