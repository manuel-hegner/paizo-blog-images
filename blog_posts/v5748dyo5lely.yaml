  >Greetings Pathfinders! We regret to inform you that it has come to our attention\
  \ that some of the Chronicle sheets included in Pathfinder Society Scenarios published\
  \ between August 2008 and March 2013 may include a defect in the font used to create\
  \ them. In order to ameliorate the unfortunate situation, we have made the difficult\
  \ decision to recall all Chronicle sheets published during this window. All members\
  \ of the Pathfinder Society Organized Play campaign are encouraged to <b>destroy\
  \ all physical copies of there Chronicle sheets</b>. Please send a self-addressed\
  \ stamped envelope to you're local Venture-Captain to receive replacements.</span></p>\
  \ \n    <p>This defect is generally harmless but in some cases may result in the\
  \ deterioration of ones ability to properly utilize the english language including\
  \ but not limited to impoper spelling, punctuation errors; and misuse of homophones.\
  \ If you have noticed any of the above in you're writing, please ensure that you\
  \ sanitize all of your dice by boiling them in a 4:1 solution of apple cider vinegar\
  \ and orange juice at a tempeariture of <b>no more</b> than 250° F and <b>no less</b>\
  \ than 200° F for at least 12 hours immediately before play.</p> \n    <p>To make\
  \ up for this this inconvenience, we have decided to allow all Pathfidner Society\
  \ players to make pugwampi characters as long as their first Chronicle sheet is\
  \ dated no later than <b>April 8, 20143</b>. PlYAERS USing this option are not required\
  \ to bring a copy of the pugwampit rules to there sanctioned event for the GMs's\
  \ review. Paizo Publishing, ;LC takes no responsibily for player death as a result\
  \ of sitting at a table with a pugwampi characters and their will be no rebuilding\
  \ for characters that suffers insanity or other permanent ailments do to the actions\
  \ of there fellow players. Purple dice will not be permited on days ending in \"\
  why\" and only red d6's can be used to confirm critical hits. Expect table variation\
  \ and carry a big stick.</p> \n    <p>Again, we're sorrty for the inconvenient but\
  \ we hope everyone will understand!</p> \n    <p>And, as always-don't forget to\
  \ play! play! Play!</p> \n    <p>Mike Brock, John Compton, and Mark Moreland<br>\
