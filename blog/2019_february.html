               <p itemprop="description">Three-day US holiday weekends brings a plethora of conventions, especially in inclement weather months when indoor hobbies reign supreme. I just got back from GenghisCon in Aurora, Colorado, and leave tomorrow for Mace West in Asheville, North Carolina. The advantage of attending mid-sized shows comes in having time to focus on the community and interact with attendees on a personal level. Some of my favorite moments come from running games. Watching a player succeed at a skill or discover a bit of lore energizes me! Talking tips and tricks with other GMs allows me to take bits for my own toolbox. There are many facets of our organized play program that I enjoy working with, but interactions with our community usually tops the list.</p> 
               <p>Speaking of the Org Play programs, our current focus involves working through our to-do checklist of items for Pathfinder Society 2 and work towards making decisions based on our surveys from last fall and the finalized version of the Pathfinder rules. If your curious about the checklist, you can <a href="/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgia?Playtest-is-over-so-what-s-the-plan">read about it here</a>. We've pretty much wrapped discussion on factions. We look forward to introducing them to you once the art we ordered for them makes its way to the office. We are working to get decisions on replay.</p> 
               <p>One of our ongoing discussions is the <em>Guide to Play</em>. Looking over the survey data, a quick start guide received overwhelming support. Before the team starts their discussion, I want to delve deeper about what our community thinks of a quick start guide. As a baseline, I envision 4-10 pages in an easy to read format, compressing dense paragraphs into charts and examples where possible. Given the limited page count, what do you think is the most important information to include in this guide? I'd love to hear your thoughts in the comments below!</p> 
               <p>On the subject of guides. We decided not to change the format of the Starfinder Society guide this year. We think tackling one guide from the ground up poses enough of a challenge. It is our intention to update the SFS Guide for Year 2 to reflect the minor changes needed to bring it up to date before we launch the year at Origins. Once we have feedback on the new Pathfinder Society, we will look at how we can integrate changes in the Starfinder Society Guide for Year 3.</p> 
               <p>Next week will be our monthly Organized Playroundup. Join us then for stars, conventions, and other news!</p> 
               <p>Until next time—Explore, Report, Cooperate!</p>

               </div> 
               <p>We've already looked at the Skeletal Speaker figure, but it's not the only skeleton in the set. No, there are two more to form the backbone of your undead army. Here we have the Skeletal Samurai and Skeletal Soldier, Medium uncommon and common figures, respectively.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20190226-SkeletalSamurai.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20190226-SkeletalSamurai_360.jpeg"></a><a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20190226-SkeletalSoldier.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20190226-SkeletalSoldier_360.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Dry bones, dry bones, so many dry bones. Often missing from the armies of undeath are aquatic creatures, the drowned dead. Well, not anymore! The Draugr, a Medium common figure, can also serve as a blue-skinned zombie or other walking dead, but is particularly useful when you need the living dead to threaten a ship or coastal community.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20190226-Draugr2.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20190226-Draugr2_360.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>While all undead threaten to haunt the dreams of the living, only some are native to the Dreamlands themselves. One such example is the Lovecraftian horror known as a Leng Ghoul, represented here as a Medium common figure.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20190226-LengGhoul.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20190226-LengGhoul_360.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Last week I promised one final deity in the series, and none seemed more fitting for this set than Arazni, whose history is intertwined with the Knights of Ozem and the Whispering Tyrant. It was the dread lich who killed her when she was Aroden's herald, known as the Red Crusader, after all. Now, she rules the undead nation of Geb in the absence of its ghostly namesake. A Medium rare figure, Arazni will be particularly useful to GMs running the Tyrant's Grasp Adventure Path, the first adventure of which should be hitting store shelves before the end of the month.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20190226-Arazni.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20190226-Arazni_360.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Among the many artifacts linked to Arazni, none are more infamous than the Bloodstones of Arazni, a set of canopic jars holding her innards. Thus, when deciding on our final piece of set dressing, we used the image of these jars to make a pair of Canopic Jars suitable for any undead tomb. In practice, they came back smaller than I would have preferred, even if they are at the correct scale. In retrospect, we probably should have cheated their size up a bit and grouped them together into a bunch instead of being individual urns.</p>

               </div> 
               <p>Finally, we end our preview series with one of the most requested figures in Pathfinder lore. A figure originally made way back in 2005 in metal form in <i>Compleat Encounter: The Vault of the Whispering Tyrant</i> (the first appearance of the iconic lich, long before Pathfinder or Golarion were even a thing), the Whispering Tyrant has never had a prepainted plastic iteration. That ends now, however, with this Medium rare figure based on the Wayne Reynolds cover of <i>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: The Inner Sea World Guide</i>.</p>

               </div> 
               <p>Next week, we'll look at the contents of the set's premium piece, the Cemetery of the Fallen, with pictures of the final pieces on display at New York Toy Fair earlier in the month.</p>

               <p><i><a href="/products/btq01wlg?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-132-Acts-of-Association">Starfinder Society #1-32: Acts of Association</a></i>, like many scenarios, is the brainchild of a conversation Organized Play Lead Developer John Compton and I had during the course of a meeting. The Starfinder Society runs missions on far-off planets all the time, so it stands to reason that they would need to negotiate contracts and treaties to allow for such exploration, right? This month's first scenario is a repeatable scenario that delves into what the Society needs to do to secure some of those agreements. With randomized missions and a randomized visiting dignitary, <i>Acts of Association</i> provides a whole lot of replayability and what I expect to be even more memorable stories as a result of these randomized elements. Written by rising freelancer, Scott Young (who also wrote <i><a href="/products/btpya1y2?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-1003-Death-On-The-Ice">Pathfinder Society #10-03: Death on the Ice</a></i> and contributed to <a href="/products/btpy9zjz?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-916-Fallen-Family-Broken-Name"><i>Pathfinder Society #9-16: Fallen Family, Broken Name</i></a>) I suspect this scenario is going to be the cause of a lot of stories that I'll be hearing about in the upcoming "Convention Season."</p> 
               <div class="blurb180">

               </div> 
               <p>Our second February scenario, <a href="/products/btq01wlk?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-133-Data-Breach"><i>Starfinder Society #1-33: Data Breach</i></a>, brings us back to an investigation that's been happening all season long. Players and GMs alike may want to brush up on the events of <a href="/products/btpy9x0w?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-107-The-Solar-Sortie"><i>Starfinder Society #1-07: The Solar Sortie</i></a> and <a href="/products/btpy9zjx?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-114-Star-Sugar-Heartlove"><i>Starfinder Society #1-14: Star Sugar Heartlove!!!</i></a> before tackling <i>Data Breach</i>, which follows the ongoing investigation into a conspiracy against the Society. Written by Pathfinder Adventure Path and scenario veteran alike, Jim Groves (who has a bibliography too long for me to link), I was astonished at some of the excellent encounter mechanics included in this scenario. For players who want a different type of scenario challenge, all taking place with the backdrop of breaking into a high-security data facility, Jim's got you covered! On a more personal note, it's been great to see some of the story arcs coming together, and I am exceptionally excited to see the reactions of players after playing this scenario as it leads into the upcoming <a href="/products/btq01x4y?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-138-The-Many-Minds-of-Historia"><i>Starifnder Society #1-38: The Many Minds of Historia</i></a>.</p> 
               <p>That about does it for February's releases. Stay tuned in the coming weeks as we begin to reveal more Starfinder Society information, as well as more scenario previews. I have it on good authority that next month we'll be getting a much better look at our good friends, the jinsuls. I've also heard that the Starfinder Society, specifically one Radaszam, might have come into possession of a treasure map that needs some following up on…</p>

                <p><i>Illustration by Michele Giorgi</i></p>
               </div> 
               <p>We had a blast coming up with the premise for <i><a href="/products/btq01wlm?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-1014-Debt-to-the-Quah">Pathfinder Society Scenario #10-14: Debt to the Quah</a>,</i> a Tier 3-7 scenario that Adrian Ng executed beautifully as the author. Although many Pathfinders are capable scholars, there are the bad eggs—unscrupulous academics willing to do anything to become famous, self-absorbed explorers ready to misinterpret an ancient site to promote their pet theories, rage-fueled warriors using the Society as an excuse to swing greatswords at others, and reckless mages who hurl fireballs while fighting in libraries. The nature of a tabletop RPG like Pathfinder lends itself to explosive combats and the PCs who can survive those encounters, yet even though I comfortably acknowledge this, there's a part of me that dies a little whenever RPGs and video games show an archaeologist character blowing up ruins or hacking apart a priceless fresco to see if there's a secret passage on the other side. Due to my archaeology background, I really enjoy including an adventure every year or so that delves into archaeology's nuances and the ramifications of casting <i>ice storm</i> in a carefully preserved tomb.</p> 
               <p>The Pathfinder Society has made some positive inroads with the generally standoffish Shoanti people, such as in <i><a href="/products/btpy8u8s?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-4-06-The-Green-Market">Pathfinder Society Scenario #4-06: Green Market</a></i> and <i><a href="/products/btpy9tl5?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-822-Wrath-of-the-Fleshwarped-Queen">Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-22: Wrath of the Fleshwarped Queen</a></i>. As <i>Debt to the Quah</i> begins, though, the PCs learn that a former Pathfinder not only looted one of the Shoantis' most revered sites, but he also mistakenly presented it as a Thassilonian ruin in the latest Pathfinder Chronicle. Imagine how upset the combined Shoanti clans must be to learn of this desecration through a scholarly journal that adds insult by misattributing their accomplishments to another culture? It's the PCs' job to play damage control. Not only do they meet with the many Shoanti quahs' representatives to repair damaged relationships, but they'll also need to repair the damaged tomb their colleague left in ruins. Fortunately, the PCs have a few allies among the Shoanti, including the half-elf Cousin to All, illustrated by Michele Giorgi. This is a really fun adventure that delves into Shaonti lore that I'm sure you'll enjoy.</p> 
               <p>So even though archaeology's considered a "destructive science," just remember not to take that too literally the next time you want to chop your way through a wall with that adamantine greataxe. Looting is a natural part of RPGs, but let this be my reminder to respect archaeological sites overall in real life. It might seem cool to climb that pyramid or swipe some pottery sherds, but only by holding ourselves to a higher standard can we preserve and understand the past for future generations.</p> 
               <div class="blurb360">

                <p><i>Illustration by Leonardo Santanna</i></p>
               </div> 
               <p>In <i><a href="/products/btq01wln?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-1015-Tapestrys-Trial">Pathfinder Society Scenario #10-15: Tapestry's Trial</a>,</i> a Tier 7-11 scenario by Alex Greenshields, we are approaching the end of the Hao Jin Tapestry storyline, and we're doing it in a big way. Within the past year, the Society learned that the museum demiplane created by the legendary sorcerer Hao Jin was collapsing during <i><a href="/products/btpya1xz?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-1000-The-Hao-Jin-Cataclysm">Pathfinder Society Special #10-00: The Hao Jin Cataclysm</a></i>. The Society's extended the demiplane's life long enough to perform salvage archaeology jobs in <i><a href="/products/btq01vpr?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-1011-The-Hao-Jin-Hierophant">Pathfinder Society Scenario #10-11: The Hao Jin Hierophant</a></i> and <i><a href="/products/btq01wkq?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-1013-Fragments-of-Antiquity">Pathfinder Society Scenario #10-13: Fragments of Antiquity</a></i>, but new cracks are appearing. The Pathfinders have one last option to save the tapestry: finding and enlisting the creator herself, none other than the storied Ruby Phoenix, Hao Jin.</p> 
               <p>This scenario's been percolating for more than half the campaign's life, ever since Mark Moreland mentioned where Hao Jin's been for so long. Not only are the PCs traveling to Axis to meet Hao Jin in person, but they're also going to learn so much more about the Ruby Phoenix's past in the process. Add to that the strange possibilities for adventure in the Eternal City—including this eclectic inevitable illustrated by Leonardo Santanna—and you have one heck of a scenario. I'm reticent to share too much more than that just to avoid spoilers.</p> 
               <p>Well, I'll explore one element just a little more. Especially in Season 10, the team's been really interested in providing the players an opportunity to understand and respond to some major NPCs' ongoing stories, particularly NPCs who have been around for 5 or more years and so have inspired some strong feelings. I'll leave it at the <i>Tapestry's Trial</i> title being a play on words with multiple meanings, which we explore considerably in the scenario. I hope you enjoy the final encounter as much as I do.</p>

               </div> 
               <p>First on the list is the Razmir Cultist, a Medium common figure representing the rank and file members of Razmir's church. These are the laity of the faith and can often be found serving an influential priest or operating as enforcers of the church's will among the common folk of Razmiran. For such service, the depicted cultist has been elevated to the church rank of Herald of the Eighth Step, as indicated by their black robe and iron mask.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20190219-RazmirCultist.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20190219-RazmirCultist_360.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>The aforementioned Razmir Priest is the second in the series, in elegant purple robes. They wield no weapons but can cast spells like any other priest, and thus present as much a threat as an entire team of acolytes. Rarer than the common acolyte, the Razmir Priest is a Medium uncommon figure.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20190219-RazmirPriest.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20190219-RazmirPriest_360.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Since the <i>Ruins of Lastwall </i>set already features so many deities, it seemed wrong not to put the setting's newest god in a rare slot. Thus, I present to you one of the most impressive figures we've ever done, in my opinion: Razmir, Living God. The intricate gold detail on his cloak is awe-inspiring, and his commanding pose demands reverence. While he'd probably have you executed for the heresy, Razmir also makes for a more generic evil spellcaster in a homebrew campaign.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20190219-Razmir.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20190219-Razmir_360.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Though it's not the most flattering comparison, I can't help but think of Scar and his hyena lackeys in Disney's <i>The Lion King </i>whenever the topic of Razmir comes up around the office. So despite being far from the deserts of Qadira or Osirion, it seems fitting to show off this set's Hyena, a Medium common figure. There's not much to say about hyenas beyond that I find their "laughs" to be among the creepiest sounds made by any animal in the real world. Now I'm going to have that sounds stuck in my head just from thinking about it. The sacrifices I make for you all!</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20190219-Hyena.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20190219-Hyena_360.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>That's it for this week. Next time we'll look at the final six figures in the set and the last piece of set dressing, including one of the most requested minis since Pathfinder Battles started, and the final deity of the set. Until then, "row like you believe."</p>

               <p itemprop="description">We closed the official Pathfinder Playtest in December and are well on the way to finalizing the final manuscript for the Core Rulebook. Now that we are close to locking and loading what Pathfinder version two looks like, the organized play team is revisiting our surveys from this fall and using them to finalize decisions as to what the new version of Pathfinder Society looks like.</p> 
               <p><br> Some community members requested information on the replay rate for Pathfinder Society version 1 and release rate of version 2, among other topics. We aren't ignoring those questions, but before we can answer those, we needed to formulate a plan for Season 10. Good news is we have a title and basic outline for where the story is going. Bad news, we won't release any news on the upcoming Pathfinder Society storyline until the PaizoCon banquet the end of May. If you want to be there to hear it first, be sure to get your <a href="/paizocon#badges">PaizoCon badge and banquet ticket.</a>.</p> 
               <p>One of the topics of discussion during the planning meetings was the use of Year and Season. We tend to call them "Year of the X" but refer to them numerically as "Season X". For example, last year was both "Year of Faction's Favor" and "Season 9". This has the potential for confusion and so we are moving to use Year exclusively. This change starts with the release of the new Starfinder Society storyline at Origins, though you won't have to wait to June for spoilers. More information about the upcoming Starfinder Society Year of the ?? coming your way via blog in a few weeks!</p> 
               <p>To keep you updated, here's a list of a few of the topics we are focused on answering in the next few months. While not comprehensive, it hits the top tier of discussion material for the team.</p> 
               <ul> 
                <li>Playtest Point Rewards</li> 
                <li>Faction Names and Symbols</li>

               </ul> 
               <p>As a reminder, while the Playtest using Doomsday Dawn is over, Pathfinder Society players may still accumulate Playtest Points using the four Playtest Scenarios—<i><a href="/products/btpya1y3?Pathfinder-Society-Playtest-Scenario-1-The-Rose-Street-Revenge">The Rose Street Revenge</a></i>, <span><a href="/products/btpya1y4?Pathfinder-Society-Playtest-Scenario-2-Raiders-of-Shrieking-Peak"><i>Raiders of Shrieking Peak</i></a></span>, <span><a href="/products/btpya1y5?Pathfinder-Society-Playtest-Scenario-3-Arclords-Envy"><i>Arclord's Envy</i></a></span>, and <span><a href="/products/btpzgd7o?Pathfinder-Society-Playtest-Scenario-4-The-Frozen-Oath"><i>The Frozen Oath</i></a></span> until sometime mid-July. The exact cutoff is still to be determined.</p> 
               <p>So, until next week, stay warm and remember to; Explore, Report, Cooperate!</p>

               <p>Here we have three of the bug-people you'll find in <em>Ruins of Lastwall</em>: the Formian Worker (Small common), Formian Warrior (Medium uncommon), and Formian Queen (Large rare). Together, they should form quite the hive for Game Masters using them as either foes or allies of the party.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20190211-FormianWorker.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20190211-FormianWorker_360.jpeg"></a> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20190211-FormianWarrior.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20190211-FormianWarrior_360.jpeg"></a> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20190211-FormianQueen.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20190211-FormianQueen_360.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Formians aren't Pathfinder's only race of anthropomorphic bugs. <em>Ruins of Lastwall</em> also features the prepainted plastic miniatures debut of the Scorpionfolk (Large uncommon), a desert-dwelling race of centaur-like arachnids who guard ancient ruins and other places of power with religious zeal.</p>

               </div> 
               <p>While not technically a bug, the Warmonger Devil certainly has features resembling an arthropod. A Large uncommon figure, these denizens of Hell are sure to strike fear into any army they march to battle against.</p>

               </div> 
               <p>Our last two previews for the week aren't bugs, per se, but they are certainly bug-adjacent. The first is the Roiling Oil, a Large uncommon ooze designed to fit a Medium or smaller figure at its center, engulfing the poor creature with its suffocating slime.</p>

               </div> 
               <p>And finally, we have the Wormswarm Sorcerer (Medium rare), a sinister spellcaster whose body is composed entirely of a mass of wriggling worms.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20190211-WormswarmSorcerer.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20190211-WormswarmSorcerer_360.jpeg"></a>

A handful of heroes are caught up in these dire events, inadvertent bearers of legendary power destined to save or doom the world.

Yet many other types of characters—including resourceful rangers, cunning rogues, powerful wizards, and canny inquisitors—are appropriate for the <a href="/tyrantsgrasp">Tyrant's Grasp Adventure Path</a>.

               <p itemprop="description">This week, WizKids—our longtime partner for prepainted plastic Pathfinder miniatures—announced the first set to be released after the launch of Pathfinder Second Edition in August of this year. <em>Pathfinder Battles: Legendary Adventures</em> features 44 figures ranging in size from Small to Huge based on all new concept art for the next evolution of Pathfinder, much of it by iconic artist Wayne Reynolds himself!</p> 
               <p>Yes, you read that right. For the first time since 2012's <em>Pathfinder Battles: Rise of the Runelords</em> set, non-premium Huge figures will be included among the randomized figures in the set. Unlike the 2012 set, however, you won't need to buy a Huge booster, but rather will get either a Huge or Large figure in every four-figure booster.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">

               </div> 
               <p>While it's still early to begin previewing this set (we're still looking at April's <em>Pathfinder Battles: Ruins of Lastwall</em>, after all), it would hardly be an announcement befitting such huge news not to show off at least a few of the new figures in the set. Check out the Dragon Turtle (Huge uncommon), Chimera (Large uncommon), Fire Giant (Large uncommon), and Dwarf Sorcerer (Medium rare) for a sample of what's coming in September!</p>

               </div> 
               <p>The premium set releasing alongside these and 40 other figures is <em>Pathfinder Battles: Legendary Adventures Goblin Village</em>, which features tents, wooden palisades, and a number of other accoutrements and decorations befitting the game's most recognizable little trouble-makers. While I don't want to give away too many of the village's features in favor of a later reveal full of all the Easter eggs and continuity callbacks they represent, here are a few samples, including the palisade gate, a large tent, a pickle barrel, and a junk pile.</p>

               <p>But you don't have to wait until September to get your mitts on minis from <em>Legendary Adventures</em>! A non-randomized set of eight alternative paint figures will be available in the <em>Pathfinder Battles: Legendary Adventures Preview Pack</em> a month earlier to coincide with the official launch of Pathfinder Second Edition. These figures are the Goblin Dog-Slicer, Orc Charger, Bugbear Skulker, Orc Battler, Goblin Guard, Hobgoblin Soldier, Armored Elf Soldier, and Halfling Slinger. Notice the redesigned orcs and hobgoblins, and killer goblin and elf armor, all courtesy of Wayne's second edition concept sketches!</p>

               <p itemprop="description">For the past month, the organized play team worked on quite a few projects, from brainstorming what the Pathfinder Society looks like going forward, to monthly scenarios, to convention planning, and more. In a quest to provide as much content we can for Pathfinder Society players, the developers pulled together another bout of sanctioning, this time focusing on Seers of the Drowned City and War for the Crown. For the details, I turn to Michael Sayre.</p> 
               <blockquote> 
                <p>"<a href="/products/btpy9op2?Pathfinder-Module-Seers-of-the-Drowned-City"><em>Seers of the Drowned City</em></a>. <a href="/warforthecrown">War for the Crown</a>. What do these two very different adventures have in common? One’s set in Taldor, the other in the Sodden Lands, so that can’t be it. Maybe it’s the fact that they are both now officially sanctioned for Pathfinder Society play, complete with Chronicle sheets and sweet loot!</p> 
                <p>Paizo developers Luis Loza and Eleanor Ferron handled the vast bulk of the sanctioning on <em>Seers of the Drowned City</em>, so I’ll start by thanking them for all their hard work! As an RPG Superstar entry in our modules line, Seers of the Drowned City has a lot of really spectacular content. Rather than talk about what <em>Seers of the Drowned City</em> is, I’m just going to say that this exciting adventure is going to give you the opportunity to claim some of those amazing RPG Superstar finalist magic items for your characters to wield during their adventures as part of the Society.</p> 
                <p>War for the Crown is a robust and fairly unique adventure path that includes a lot of really cool hooks, from chances to join Taldor’s nobility to finding “relics,” unique magic items that grow with their wielder. Making those relics work in an organized play environment and outside of the more structured progression of an Adventure Path required a fair bit of discussion and experimentation, but ultimately we felt like these items were an important part of experiencing the Adventure Path and we didn’t want to relegate them to non-scaling items or more “mundane” versions of themselves. As a result, we’ve created boons and options to access these cool items in organized play and bring them with you from the Adventure Path into the wider gaming environment. If magic items and weapons don’t hold a ton of draw for you, never fear! You’ll also have the opportunity to join one of Taldor’s noble houses, claiming a house name and all the benefits and prestige that go along with it!”</p> 
                <p>You can find the chronicle sheets for the adventures on their respective product pages and on the <a href="/pathfindersociety/rpg/additional">Additional Resources Page</a>.</p>

               <h2>Campaign Coins</h2> 
               <p>Last fall, while at PaizoCon Asia-Pacific, I left a campaign coin in the hands of a trusted messenger. I learned last month the recipient received their coin, so this month I have the pleasure of announcing Paul Trani as that unnamed beneficiary. Vivat!</p> 
               <p>During January, I visited MagFest in Washington, D.C. and SCARAB in Columbia, South Carolina. While I did not have the privilege to present any campaign coins while at MagFest, I enjoyed recognizing several volunteers at SCARAB. The recipients’ spent hours working on growing their areas as well as answering questions on a variety of platforms and running games at large conventions. Stalwart supports of their communities, there would not be as robust an organized play presence without their efforts.</p> 
               <p>Huge huzzahs to the following!</p> 
               <ul>
                <li>Paul Trani (New #805, Received at PaizoCon AP 2018)</li> 
                <li>Amanda Plageman (New #806, Received at SCARAB 2019)</li> 
                <li>Matt Polkowsky (New #807, Received at SCARAB 2019)</li>
               </ul> 
               <p>If you know a deserving member of your community, please email me at&nbsp;organizedplay@paizo.com&nbsp;with their name, location, and the reasons you feel they should be recognized for their service. If you are able, please include what events they may attend in 2019 so that we can either make awards in person (preferred) or make arrangements for deliver.</p> 
               <h2>Stars and Novas</h2> 
               <p>January started off with a bang of conventions/game days and our gms spent hours offering games to their communities. Two GMs achieved their 5th star this month. Reaching this milestone means they ran 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios, as well as run a game for a venture-captain. A conservative estimate of time needed to reach 5-stars is 650 hours! To the GMs listed below, thank you very much for the time and energy you spend running Pathfinder Society games!</p> 
               <ul>
                <li>Joonas Frösen</li> 
                <li>Gary Tierney</li>
               </ul> 
               <p>Regarding novas, our technical team is working on implementing a new method of tracking. Investigating the code, we found an issue with how the system awards 4-stars when gms reach their 100th GM credit. Before we could add the 5-nova process , we had to stop and fix the issue. This issue is one of the top priorities and one we hope to solve soon.</p> 
               <p>I’ll update more when I have news!</p> 
               <h2>Convention Listing</h2> 
               <p>Want to attend a convention in the next few months? Check out the list below! The list includes all the event support requests received to date. If you see one missing, ping the organizer and have them submit a request for support or have them email me at [email]organizedplay@paizo.com[/email] to discuss their event. All of the conventions on the list maintain some type of web presence, be it website, social media page, or Warhorn listing, so if you are interested in attending in either capacity, check out their websites or contact the local venture-officer for more information!</p>

               <p itemprop="description">Well, we're at the halfway point of our series of blogs previewing the contents of the forthcoming <em>Pathfinder Battles: Ruins of Lastwall</em> prepainted plastic miniature set from WizKids. I've shown off the crusaders of Lastwall and their celestial allies, the agents of the lich lord known as the Whispering Tyrant, and the extraplanar exemplars of balance. Today we take a look at a handful of creatures that aren't necessarily involved in the conflict between the tyrant and the people of Lastwall but who nevertheless have embraced the forces of darkness.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">

               </div> 
               <p>Prime among these are the calligni, also known as dark folk, who reside in the depths of the Darklands beneath Golarion's surface. <em>Ruins of Lastwall</em> features three calligni figures who can make for a variety of challenging encounters for parties of low- to mid-level. The Small common Calligni Creeper showed itself way back in September and today its companions, the Small common Calligni Slayer and Medium common Calligni Stalker. While this leaves a few callignis out of the mix (dancers and callers, mostly), it should allow GMs running the newly released <em>Pathfinder Module: Cradle of Night</em> to represent some of the allies and enemies in the adventure with more accurate miniatures.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20190205-Slayer.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20190205-Slayer_500.jpeg"></a><a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20190205-Stalker.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20190205-Stalker_500.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Rounding out our Darklands inhabitants for <em>Ruins of Lastwall</em> is the Tomb Giant, a Large uncommon figure representing a member of this race of subterranean necromancers. It's a good thing they aren't big on cooperating with other races, because they would be a terror on the battlefields of Lastwall on the side of the Whispering Tyrant!</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20190205-TombGiant.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20190205-TombGiant_500.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>All three of the most recent previews of the set have shown off at least one outsider, so I guess I won't break that trend. Who better to appear in a blog about darkness than a creature from the Plane of Shadow? Here we have the Velstrac Evangelist, the most common type of kyton in the setting. A Medium common figure, collectors should be able to build quite a squad of these chain-bound (called, appropriately a link and a chain, depending on their exact number).</p>

               </div> 
               <p>Finally, a piece of dungeon dressing befitting a kyton: a torture rack. Whether you're putting a PC on it to raise the stakes for your players or simply setting one in a deungeon to set the mood and show what sort of inhabitants might live there.</p>

               </div> 
               <p>That's it for this week, but tune back in next time for an infestation of bugs, bug people, and other squirmy wormies you'll find in <em>Ruins of Lastwall</em>. Until then, beware of the dark!</p>

We've just unleashed <em><a href="/products/btq01w1y?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Wilderness-Origins">Pathfinder Player Companion: Wilderness Origins</a></em> and if you follow me, we can take a look at this beautiful volume as it hits bookshelves and the digital downloads of paizo.com as a PDF. Now be careful as we take a peek inside!</p> 
               <p>Now, the first thing you need to know about this book is that serves as a companion to <i><a href="/products/btpy9ujo?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Ultimate-Wilderness">Ultimate Wilderness</a></i>. This book is your go-to source to expand on the content from <i>Ultimate Wilderness</i> with new archetypes, feats, magic items, and so much more. Shifters can look forward to new animal aspects, like the boar and octopus aspects, new feats that allow you to apply a weapon's properties to your shifter claws, and even a new system to replace your claw attacks with alternate attack types, like bites, gores, and talons. Shifters looking to expand beyond the animal kingdom can make use of specialized archetypes like the swarm shifter, which eventually allows the shifter to become several swarms of vermin at once!</p> 
               <p>Players using the new races from <em>Ultimate Wilderness</em> can look forward to lots of options as well. Each of the three races receive new alternate racial traits to allow for further customization of these natural heroes. Gathlains can take feats that allow them meld with trees or call treants to their sides. Ghorans can harness the power of petals floating on the wind to create showers of blossoms that allow them to hide from their enemies. Vine leshys can extend their verdant natures to others, creating explosive growths that aid their allies!</p>

               </div> 
               <p>In addition to all of the options for these characters, we give a lot of love to our furry and scaly friends with new options for animal companions and familiars. Among these are several new archetypes. Some of my favorites include the apex species archetype for animal companions, which empowers your animal companion to gain extra abilities while in its home habitat, and the parasite archetype for familiars, which allows your familiar to attach itself to your foes and attempt to take them over! We also have lots of new feats for your companions and familiars and an expanded list of available animal companions for cavaliers, paladins, and rangers.</p> 
               <p>Other characters that are looking to tap into the power of the wilderness have plenty of options to look forward to in this book. Among these are several new magic flowers, spells that call upon the might of natural disasters, and other class abilities that tap into the power of nature such as new arcanist exploits, barbarian rage powers, kineticist talents, and witch hexes. Whether you're just roughing it or have become one with nature, make sure to check out <em>Pathfinder Player Companion: Wilderness Origins</em>!</p>
