  /products/btpy9n5a\"><em>Pathfinder RPG Horror Adventures</em></a> will be launching\
  \ at Gen Con 2016 and landing on store shelves! And while the GM is the one who\
  \ sets a lot of the atmosphere in a horror game, each player and character contributes\
  \ to the ambience—what better way to do that than to partake in horror-themed character\
  \ options? In this blog, I'll give you all a preview of the character options within\
  \ this book.</p> \n     <p>To start, let's look at one of the most mysterious and\
  \ anticipated sections: the corruptions! Corruptions grant your character new powers,\
  \ but they also stain your character with drawbacks and risk your character losing\
  \ control to the darkness within. Each corruption comes with a catalyst, which describes\
  \ how you might acquire, progress, and remove the main source of corruption, as\
  \ well as a number of manifestations that each grant you a gift and an associated\
  \ stain. There's also variants for useful corruptions, where you can ignore the\
  \ stains, and vile corruptions, where you have no control over the manifestations\
  \ but can ignore the gifts to help you fight off the corruption's influence. The\
  \ 11 corruptions are as follows: Accursed grants you powers of curses and revenge\
  \ like a hag or a fey. Deep one grants you aquatic abilities and other benefits\
  \ associated with deep ones. Ghoul grants claws, stench, paralysis, and other powers\
  \ related to ghouls and ghasts. Hellbound grants diabolical abilities like horns\
  \ and the ability to summon devils. Hive is related to a new subtype of aberration\
  \ created by a depraved annunaki; while normally hive larvae gestate in your body\
  \ for sustenance and then kill you, a hive corrupted character has survived a rare\
  \ metabolic symbiosis, gaining hive-related powers instead like a hive mind or acid\
  \ blood. Lich grants you powers related to a failed attempt at lichdom, including\
  \ necromantic mastery and a corpselike countenance. Lycanthropy grants you the ability\
  \ to shift form into an animal or hybrid as well as other lycanthropic powers. Possessed\
  \ grants you benefits from a second mind or soul within your body, such as letting\
  \ your possessing spirit give you another shot against Will saves. Promethean comes\
  \ about when you replace your body parts with construct parts, and it grants various\
  \ construct-related abilities, particularly resistances and immunities. Shadowbound\
  \ fills you with darkness and empties your life of joy, granting darkness and fear\
  \ abilities. Finally, vampirism grants vampire abilities like fangs and summoning\
  \ a rat swarm.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PZO1135-Corruptions.jpg\"\

  \     <br> <i>Illustration by Kiki Moch Rizky</i>\n     </div> \n     <p>Unlike\
  \ many other books, there's actually a brief section on new race rules with some\
  \ cool variant abilities that work well in a horror campaign. One fun example is\
  \ the halfling ability creepy doll, which lets you use freeze like a gargoyle in\
  \ order to appear to be a creepy-looking doll instead of a creature, and lets you\
  \ Intimidate larger humanoids without a penalty due to your size.</p> \n     <div\
  \ class=\"blurb360\">\n      <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PZO1135-HallowedNecromancer.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n      <br> <i>Illustration by Hugh Pindur</i>\n     </div> \n     <p>There's\
  \ plenty of horrific archetypes and class options as well! For instance, the blood\
  \ alchemist uses sentient lives to fuel her alchemy and can create alchemical circles\
  \ like an occultist in order to apply formulas to an area instead of himself. The\
  \ barbarian gains new rage powers including cult totem and daemon totem. The cleric\
  \ elder mythos cultist archetype is a cleric who uses Charisma instead of Wisdom\
  \ and is rather insane. Devolutionist druids devolve animals and humanoids into\
  \ feral ancestors (including their animal companion, a devolved humanoid). Hexenhammer\
  \ inquisitors mix blasphemous dark arts with their faith and must balance these\
  \ transgressions with penance. Cult hunter investigators seek out horrific cults\
  \ like your typical Lovecraft investigators. Kineticists gain the elemental whispers\
  \ wild talents, which allow them to make friends with a voice in their head and\
  \ even manifest it. Mediums can contact vile legendary spirits like the heretic,\
  \ which replaces the hierophant and helps you infiltrate a good religion and corrupt\
  \ it to evil. Hate-monger mesmerists can sow xenophobic hatred while applying touch\
  \ treatment without the touched creature realizing it. Talisman crafter occultists\
  \ can create talismans holding their spells that others can activate. Soul sentinel\
  \ paladins can help with confusion and corruptions with their mercies and become\
  \ immune to hexes and curses. Witch killer slayers are experts in hunting and killing\
  \ arcane spellcasters, including an ability called \"burn the witch\". Necrologists\
  \ are evil spiritualists that house vile undead within them, rather than phantoms.\
  \ Hangman vigilantes are whip and noose experts. Tatterdemalion witches command\
  \ fabric and thread and can stitch a creature's eyes or mouth shut. Finally, hallowed\
  \ necromancer wizards use their necromancy to destroy undead, rather than create\
  \ them.</p> \n     <p><a href=\"/products/btpy9n5a\"><em>Horror Adventures</em></a>\
  \ also has a variety of fun and horrifying feats, as well as feats to fight against\
  \ the encroaching darkness. For instance, Absorb Spirit lets you temporarily house\
  \ a rejuvenating spirit within you to prevent it from returning for a time, and\
  \ Disconcerting Knowledge lets you demoralize a foe with Knowledge checks to identify\
  \ its weaknesses. There's also plenty of monster feats (including one where a shapeshifter's\
  \ form change involves ripping out of its old body in a gruesome fashion), a small\
  \ assortment of story feats (like Twisted Love, where a horrible creature is in\
  \ love with you), and even four new styles: Brute Style lets you victimize prone\
  \ opponents like a rampaging kaiju, Deadhand Style allows you to manipulate fear\
  \ and eventually inflict negative levels with your unarmed strikes for ki, Kyton\
  \ Style lets you use a spiked chain as a monk weapon and eventually as a shield\
  \ as well as a weapon, and Maddening Style lets you strike at a foe's sanity and\
  \ eventually obliterate your fallen foes as <i>disintegrate</i>.</p> \n     <p>There\
  \ are dark spells from foul tomes as well as righteous incantations to defeat them.\
  \ The <i>death clutch</i> spell causes someone's heart to leap out into your hand\
  \ while <i>damnation</i> deals damage to nearby creatures in proportion to their\
  \ most powerful evil spell or spell effect. <i>Vile dog transformation</i> transforms\
  \ dogs into horrific servitors, and they dissolve into a stinking pile of gore and\
  \ bones at the end of the spell (if the dog trusts you, it takes a -4 penalty on\
  \ its save to avoid being transformed), while <i>holy javelin</i> impales an evil\
  \ creature, dealing ongoing damage and weakening them.</p> \n     <p>When it comes\
  \ to magic items, there are a variety of horrific items, like a withered heart you\
  \ can squeeze to damage your foes, an altar that lets you <i>animated dead</i> without\
  \ expending onyx, gloves that give you mouths on your hands, ad a mantle of darkness\
  \ that creates <i>deeper darkness</i> when you take a total defense. There's also\
  \ holy items like a holy symbol that dazzles your foes when you channel or use it\
  \ as a divine focus, a holy symbol that lets you calm down creatures by healing\
  \ them with your channel, and a monocle that helps protect you from reading something\
  \ that harm you (or your sanity!). There's also cursed items like the needful doll\
  \ that demands attention lest it give you nightmares, as well as artifacts like\
  \ the <i>dark grimoire</i>, which lets anyone cast any spell by studying it for\
  \ 1 hour per spell level (you even ignore material component costs by sacrificing\
  \ humanoid creatures—how convenient!).</p> \n     <p>And that's just a sampling\
  \ of the goodies in store for you. Stay tuned next week when we'll be focusing on\
  \ some of the cool GM tools and advice in the book!</p> \n     <p>Mark Seifter<br>\
