  artist: "far my favorite part of all the Gygax fiction I've read is his interpretation\
    \ of that most classic of fantasy tropes: the wizard's duel. While we got a taste\
    \ of such things in The Anubis Murders, the original Dungeon Master takes the\
    \ art to new heights in The Samarkand Solution, showing us the sort of arcane\
    \ power and creativity Magister Setne Inhetep is capable of when pushed to the\
    \ limit by an another wizard-priest as adept as himself. To see what I mean, check\
    \ out the following excerpt"
