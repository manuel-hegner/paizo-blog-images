  \  <p itemprop=\"description\">Deities and their domains are a big part of what\
  \ makes clerics special. Logan set the stage with <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkqb?Cleric-Class-Preview\"\
  >his cleric blog on Monday</a>, so now let's get into the weeds and take a look\
  \ at how we structured deities and domains.</p> \n    <h2>Basic Deities</h2> \n\
  \    <p>For each deity, we present some basic information, including areas of concern,\
  \ titles, alignment, edicts, anathema, and favored weapon. Most of these are familiar\
  \ or self-explanatory. One of the newer entries, anathema, is a concept Logan mentioned\
  \ on Monday. This entry provides examples of actions that violate the deity's tenets.\
  \ Let's take Shelyn as an example.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <h3>Shelyn</h3>\
  \ \n     <p>The Eternal Rose is the goddess of art, beauty, love, and music. She\
  \ seeks to one day redeem her corrupted brother Zon-Kuthon.</p> \n     <p><b>Alignment</b>\
  \ NG<br> <b>Edicts</b> be peaceful, choose and perfect an art, lead by example,\
  \ see the beauty in all things<br> <b>Anathema</b> destroy works of art or allow\
  \ one to be destroyed except to save a life or in pursuit of greater art, refuse\
  \ to accept surrender, strike first<br> <b>Favored Weapon</b> glaive</p> \n    </blockquote>\
  \ \n    <p>This entry gives you a good idea of how to play a Shelynite PC of any\
  \ class. For example, a fighter faithful Shelyn might consider wielding her goddess's\
  \ favored weapon, and even lay followers would likely feel terrible guilt at committing\
  \ anathema acts even though they face no mechanical consequence for doing so. But\
  \ what kind of cool stuff do you get if you're a cleric of a specific deity?</p>\
  \ \n    <h2>Clerics and Deities</h2> \n    <p>Your choice of deity is essential\
  \ when determining what type of cleric you play. A free-spirited and optimistic\
  \ Desnan cleric, a tyrannical and scheming Asmodean, and a self-reliant perfectionist\
  \ Iroran all relate to the world in different ways. We wanted to reflect this with\
  \ a variety of character customization options based on deity! We've included a\
  \ chart that indicates each deity's areas of concern, alignment (and the alignments\
  \ allowed for their clerics), type of channeled energy (positive, negative, or either),\
  \ signature skill, favored weapon, domains, and spells. For instance, here's Shelyn's\
  \ entry on that table:</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <div class=\"callout-block\"\
  > \n      <table class=\"table-spacing-large\" style=\"width: 100%;\"> \n      \
  \ <tbody>\n        <tr>\n         <td>Shelyn</td>\n         <td>Art, beauty, love,\
  \ and music</td>\n         <td>NG (LG, NG, CG)</td>\n         <td>Positive</td>\n\
  \         <td>Crafting</td>\n         <td>Glaive</td>\n         <td>Creation, family,<br>passion,\
  \ protection</td>\n         <td>1st: <i>color spray</i>,<br>3rd: <i>enthrall</i>,\
  \ 4th: <i>creation</i></td>\n        </tr>\n       </tbody> \n      </table> \n\
  \     </div> \n    </blockquote> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\">\n     <a href=\"\
  //cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20180427-Domains.jpg\"><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20180427-Domains_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n     <p><i>Illustration by Wayne Reynolds</i></p>\n    </div> \n    <p>The\
  \ deity's areas of concern include a brief restatement of her titles.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>You'll notice the alignment lists not only Shelyn's alignment of neutral good,\
  \ but also all the alignments her clerics could have in parentheses. Listing it\
  \ this way allows us (or you, for your own deities) to be more expressive when creating\
  \ deities. For instance, Norgorber now has slightly different alignments permitted\
  \ for his clerics depending on which aspect of the deity they worship! Or, you could\
  \ create a new deity of balance through opposing extremes who accepts only neutral,\
  \ lawful good, chaotic good, chaotic evil, and lawful evil clerics.</p> \n    <p>Listing\
  \ the type of channeled energy the deity grants allows for some really exciting\
  \ situations. For instance, Lamasthu may be an incredibly evil deity of nightmares,\
  \ but she's also a deity of the wild fecundity of the Abyss, so she allows her clerics\
  \ to choose negative or positive energy when channeling. You could even have a good\
  \ deity that granted only negative energy (none of the core deities worshiped in\
  \ the Inner Sea region of Golarion do so, but it could be possible for a deity like\
  \ Tsukiyo, perhaps, as part of his dualism with Shizuru) or an evil deity that could\
  \ grant only positive energy.</p> \n    <p>The deity's signature skill is in addition\
  \ to those all clerics gain, so Shelynite clerics always have the ability to reach\
  \ great heights in Crafting. Norgorberite clerics, in contrast, gain Stealth in\
  \ order to blend into the shadows, allowing them to fit in well with clandestine\
  \ groups.</p> \n    <p>What about those spells at the end? Those are three extra\
  \ spells that all clerics of Shelyn can prepare and cast! These aren't in any sort\
  \ of special \"domain slots\" like before; you can cast them as few or as many times\
  \ as you want. Oh, and Sarenrae has <i>fireball</i>!</p> \n    <p>But wait, Mark,\
  \ what about...</p> \n    <h2>Domains</h2> \n    <p>Pathfinder First Edition has\
  \ a list of domains that cover a variety of basic concepts but miss others entirely,\
  \ and they are fairly generic, which means they don't always convey the nuance of\
  \ why your deity has that domain. A great example of this was the Death domain and\
  \ all its undead spells not really fitting with Pharasma, the goddess of death who\
  \ hates undead.</p> \n    <p>One of the earliest and coolest innovations to domains\
  \ in Pathfinder appeared in the <em>Advanced Player's Guide</em>, where subdomains\
  \ altered domains to add nuance. In the playtest, we're bringing in that sort of\
  \ flexibility right away! Each domain has a basic power and an advanced power, and\
  \ because domain powers work as spells, creating a new domain that's perfect for\
  \ your world is as simple as adding two spells. This allowed us to include significantly\
  \ more domains in the game and will allow us to expand to even more domains with\
  \ ease. Here's the list of new domains that don't share a name with any of the old\
  \ domains (some names you might recognize from subdomains):</p> \n    <ul>\n   \
  \  <li>Ambition</li> \n     <li>Cities</li> \n     <li>Confidence</li> \n     <li>Creation</li>\
  \ \n     <li>Dreams</li> \n     <li>Family</li> \n     <li>Fate</li> \n     <li>Freedom</li>\
  \ \n     <li>Indulgence</li> \n     <li>Light</li> \n     <li>Might</li> \n    \
  \ <li>Moon</li> \n     <li>Nature</li> \n     <li>Nightmares</li> \n     <li>Pain</li>\
  \ \n     <li>Passion</li> \n     <li>Perfection</li> \n     <li>Secrecy</li> \n\
  \     <li>Truth</li> \n     <li>Tyranny</li> \n     <li>Undeath</li> \n     <li>Wealth</li>\
  \ \n     <li>Zeal</li>\n    </ul> \n    <p>These domains allow for a variety of\
  \ powers that can really give you the feel of playing a cleric of a specific deity,\
  \ both in combat and out! For example, take a look at this fun noncombat basic power\
  \ from the Indulgence domain:</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-title\"\
  >Enhance Victuals (Transmutation) <span class=\"stat-block-cr\">Power 1</span></p>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"stat-block\"><b>Casting</b> 1 minute (Material, Somatic, Verbal\
  \ Casting)<br> <b>Range</b> touch; <b>Target</b> 1 nonmagical pint of water or pound\
  \ of food</p> \n     <p>You transform the target into delicious fare, changing water\
  \ into wine or another fine beverage or enhancing food's taste and ingredients to\
  \ make it a gourmet treat. The transformation also attempts to counteract toxins\
  \ in the food or water. If you have Spell Points, you can add an additional pint\
  \ or pound for each additional Spell Point you spend. The feast vanishes if not\
  \ consumed.</p> \n     <p><b>Heightened (+1)</b> Increase initial and additional\
  \ pints or pounds by 1.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>So if you're a cleric of\
  \ Cayden Cailean or Urgathoa, you're going to be able to party in style. Since powers\
  \ are automatically heightened as you gain levels, that means for just 1 Spell Point,\
  \ a 7th-level cleric can make enough gourmet food for her whole adventuring party\
  \ to have a meal, and they'll be able to throw a banquet to serve an incredible\
  \ number of guests if they pour plenty of Spell Points into it during downtime.\
  \ That's all with only 1 minute to prepare, making them a wonderful host for any\
  \ occasion!</p> \n    <p>Meanwhile, the Fate domain has an advanced power that might\
  \ come in handy in a clutch. But I'll ask you before we dive inâ€”are you feeling\
  \ lucky?</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-title\">Tempt Fate\
  \ (divination, Fortune) <span class=\"stat-block-cr\">Power 2</span></p> \n    \
  \ <p class=\"stat-block\"><b>Casting</b> [[F]] Somatic free action; <b>Trigger</b>\
  \ You or an ally within range attempts a saving throw.<br> <b>Range</b> 120 feet;\
  \ <b>Target</b> you or a willing ally in range</p> \n     <p>If the triggering saving\
  \ throw's result is a success, it counts as a critical success. If it's a failure,\
  \ it counts as a critical failure, and the critical failure can't be reduced by\
  \ abilities that usually reduce critical failure, such as improved evasion. If the\
  \ triggering ability did not have both a critical success and critical failure condition,\
  \ tempt fate fails and your Spell Point is refunded.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n\
  \    <p>With tempt fate, you take your fate into your own hands, promising either\
  \ total vindication from your saving throw or total disaster! This was a favorite\
  \ of Jason's cleric of Pharasma in one of our playtests, and needless to say, it's\
  \ a better choice to use this for your strong saving throws than your weak ones.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>But what about Shelyn? Let's close by taking a look at two of the powers\
  \ from her granted domains, one for in combat and one for outside of combat:</p>\
  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-title\">Unity (Abjuration, Fortune)\
  \ <span class=\"stat-block-cr\">Power 2</span></p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block\"\
  ><b>Casting</b> [[R]] Verbal reaction; <b>Trigger</b> You and one or more allies\
  \ within range are targeted by a spell or ability that allows a saving throw.<br>\
  \ <b>Range</b> 30 feet</p> \n     <p>You allow your allies within range to use your\
  \ saving throw modifier instead of their own. Each ally decides individually which\
  \ modifier to use.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Unity is really useful for a\
  \ support cleric with good saving throw modifiers, and it's particularly great for\
  \ those dangerous area effects that require Will saving throws like a harpy's song,\
  \ since few allies will be able to match your cleric's Will modifier!</p> \n   \
  \ <blockquote> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-title\">Artistic Flourish (Transmutation)\
  \ <span class=\"stat-block-cr\">Power 2</span></p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block\"\
  ><b>Casting</b> 10 minutes (Material, Somatic, Verbal)<br> <b>Range</b> touch; <b>Target</b>\
  \ one item or work of art<br> <b>Duration</b> 24 hours</p> \n     <p>You infuse\
  \ the target with artisanal and artistic vision. Its quality increases to match\
  \ your proficiency rank in Crafting, to a maximum of expert. The target is a beautiful\
  \ and impressive piece for its new quality, but the effect is obviously temporary,\
  \ so it can't be sold for more than normal. This doesn't allow you to use the target\
  \ to Craft a magic item that requires the new quality or perform any other task\
  \ requiring a permanent item of that quality.</p> \n     <p><b>Heightened (4th)</b>\
  \ If you spend 1 additional Spell Point, the maximum quality increases to master.<br>\
  \ <b>Heightened (8th)</b> If you spend 2 additional Spell Points, the maximum quality\
  \ increases to legendary.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Not only is artistic\
  \ flourish a great way to express your character's inner artisan, but it can also\
  \ be of great use in a pinch when you could really use a very specific tool or item\
  \ of high quality. Legendary-quality items aren't cheap, after all! This is also\
  \ a great example of one way that using Spell Points allows us to play around a\
  \ bit more and make the spell more interesting by varying costs. You saw this a\
  \ bit earlier with <i>enhance victuals</i>, but here it's more than just the ability\
  \ to save extra castings for a large batch. These sorts of flourishes are possible\
  \ to word under a \"uses per day\" system, but it's awkward, and they're straightforward\
  \ to create and easy to understand with a Spell Point pool.</p> \n    <p>So who's\
  \ your favorite deity? What sorts of new domains can you imagine with this new system?\
