  \ Of Strong Character</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Friday, July 11, 2014</p> \n \
  \  <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">It's hard\
  \ to believe that PaizoCon is just a week behind us. In the mad rush to ship files\
  \ for the product catalog and the <a href=\"/products/btpy965u\"><i>Pathfinder RPG\
  \ Monster Codex</i></a> to the printer by the end of the day today, this week has\
  \ been every bit as busy as the one preceding the convention, if not a little bit\
  \ busier.</span></p> \n    <p>But, as I've said many times before, being busy is\
  \ no excuse for not showing off some Friday afternoon goodness, and this week we've\
  \ got some VERY good things to show off, or at least three figures that could very\
  \ well have \"good\" in their alignment.</p> \n    <p>All three are from November's\
  \ upcoming <a href=\"/products/btpy96kb\"><i>The Lost Coast</i></a> set of <a href=\"\
  /pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder Battles</a> prepainted fantasy miniatures. It's\
  \ a set that's shaping up to be one of my favorites, as the general theme allows\
  \ me to simply select miniatures based on fantastic art and the potential for lots\
  \ of use at the table. After several sets based on specific characters from our\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath\">Pathfinder Adventure Paths</a> (which I\
  \ obviously also love), it's a refreshing change.</p> \n    <p>Enough preamble.\
  \ Let's take a look at this week's reveals!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  > <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20140711-HaughtyAvenger.jpg\"> <img\

  0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Here we have the fantastic Haughty Avenger, from\
  \ page 113 of the <a href=\"/products/btpy8v3a\"><i>Pathfinder RPG NPC Codex</i></a>.\
  \ This remarkable half-elf makes a perfect player character for any well-dressed\
  \ Medium female adventurer, and she's \"generic\" enough that she could also work\
  \ as a guard or rank-and-file mook in a group of upper-class enemies. The Haughty\
  \ Avenger is an uncommon, Medium figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a\
  \ href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20140711-ShoantiGladiator.jpg\"> <img\
  \ src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20140711-ShoantiGladiator_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>That sound you hear is the crowd cheering for the\
  \ Shoanti Barbarian, whose earthbreaker weapon is ready for service against friends\
  \ or enemies, depending on the whims of the Game Master. This particular race/weapon\
  \ combination has been on our personal wishlist for a long time, as Shoanti show\
  \ up in several Pathfinder products, particularly those set in the realm of Varisia.\
  \ He works great as a player character or as an enemy (in the arena or otherwise).\
  \ The Shoanti Gladiator is a Medium, uncommon figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  > <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20140711-ForestShadow.jpg\"> <img src=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderBattles/20140711-ForestShadow_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\">\
  \ </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>This gentlemen prefers to be called \"The Forest Shadow,\"\
  \ the name under which he appears as a sample NPC in the <a href=\"/products/btpy88yj\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i></a>. When I was putting together the set list\
  \ for this set, my boss Lisa Stevens asked that I make sure to include some elves—\
  so I included perhaps my favorite elf image we've produced to date. This figure\
  \ is amazingly three-dimensional and awesome, and I think you're going to love him.\
  \ I predict many, many, many players using The Forest Shadow as their player character.\
  \ The Forest Shadow is a Medium, rare figure.</p> \n    <p>And that's it for this\
  \ week. I still don't have an update on WizKids' plans to address the \"Sad Feiya\"\
  \ issue from Reign of Winter, but I do know that they are moving forward with an\
  \ equitable solution that should please just about everyone who was underwhelmed\
  \ by that figure (which I imagine is just about everyone). The details of how to\
  \ pull off what they're planning are complicated, however, and they've asked me\
  \ to keep them hush-hush until they are absolutely certain with the details. I urge\
  \ you to be patient—I think you'll find that patience will pay off in this case.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Until next week's preview, I remain...</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p>\
