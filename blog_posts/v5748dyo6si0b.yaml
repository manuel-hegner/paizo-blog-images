  \ Transgender Day of Visibility (TDoV) is once again upon us! TDoV is an annual\
  \ day (March 31) to celebrate and show support for our transgender and gender-expansive\
  \ communities. It’s a day of empowerment, celebrating the lives and accomplishments\
  \ of these communities while raising awareness of the work that is still needed\
  \ to combat discrimination.</p> \n     <p>So let’s start with the good news, rare\
  \ as it might seem sometimes: the last couple of years have shown us that the needle\
  \ is moving in the right direction. According to <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/07/27/rising-shares-of-u-s-adults-know-someone-who-is-transgender-or-goes-by-gender-neutral-pronouns/\"\
  >Pew Research Center</a>, more than 42% of US adults in 2021 said they know or are\
  \ friends with a transgender and/or gender-expansive person, an increase from 37%\
  \ in 2017. Authentic portrayals of transgender and gender-expansive people are increasing\
  \ in popular culture, and we’re finally starting to see more transgender and gender-expansive\
  \ politicians elected. There are so many reasons to celebrate our community’s growth\
  \ and acceptance. </p> \n     <p>But this newfound visibility has brought ever greater\
  \ and more serious costs. Being transgender or gender-expansive in 2022 also comes\
  \ with fear, anger, and uncertainty, as the validity of our existence is under an\
  \ unprecedented assault. 2022 has already seen <a href=\"https://freedomforallamericans.org/legislative-tracker/anti-transgender-legislation/\"\
  >over 240 anti-LGBTQI+ bills filed with 34 states</a>, with the overwhelming majority\
  \ specifically targeting transgender people; this is roughly the same number of\
  \ anti-LGBTQI+ bills filed over the <em>entirety</em> of 2021. Over the past few\
  \ years, these bills have mostly focused on limiting discussion of gender identity\
  \ and sexual orientation in schools, limiting or preventing transgender athletes’\
  \ participation in sports, limiting bathroom access, and preventing the changing\
  \ or elimination of gender markers on licenses and birth certificates. </p> \n \
  \    <p>Though the sheer number of these bills is already cause for concern, they’\
  re also getting more aggressive. The authors of these bills now seek to completely\
  \ cut off access to life-saving gender affirming care and criminalize the parents\
  \ of transgender and gender-expansive youth and the providers of their medical care.\
  \ Two of the most egregious recent examples of this have been in Texas and Idaho.\
  \ In February, Texas Governor Greg Abbott directed the Department of Family and\
  \ Protective Services to investigate parents who provide gender-affirming medical\
  \ care to their transgender children for potential child abuse. Not to be outdone,\
  \ a bill passed by the Idaho House of Representatives (HB 675) would make it a felony,\
  \ punishable by life in prison, not only to provide gender-affirming treatment,\
  \ but to provide permission for a minor to receive it, or to permit a minor to travel\
  \ out of state to receive it.</p> \n     <p>Clearly, the transgender and gender-expansive\
  \ community is quite visible right now—to the extent that one might ask why we need\
  \ a specific day for visibility. The answer is simple: people who are questioning\
  \ their identity or working towards coming out publicly need to see transgender\
  \ and gender-expansive people who are happy, thriving, and living their best lives.\
  \ The more we are seen and accepted, the louder our voices can become.</p> \n  \
  \   <p>I’m proud to be a visible and publicly transgender person. This month will\
  \ mark 9 years since I came out as transgender. I was lucky to have a caring family\
  \ that helped me at each stage of my transition, but even with their unwavering\
  \ support, I would very likely not have been able to come out and find acceptance\
  \ with myself if it wasn’t for the courage of other transgender and gender-expansive\
  \ people showing me that it was OK to be me. I’m alive today because of those people\
  \ being very loud and very proud about who they are.</p> \n     <p>So how do we\
  \ keep transgender and gender-expansive people visible, and how do we counter this\
  \ recent wave of hate directed at people who only want to live a fulfilling life?\
  \ To my transgender and gender-expansive friends and colleagues: continue to have\
  \ the courage to make yourselves as visible as possible. Continue to live your best\
  \ lives and serve as inspiration for others who are about to embark on that journey,\
  \ who are struggling in their transitions, or who just need to see someone rocking\
  \ it to help them find inspiration to get through a tough day. Keep your heads up,\
  \ be loud and proud of who you are, and keep fighting like hell. </p> \n     <p>To\
  \ our allies: don’t get complacent. For those of you who don’t know, aside from\
  \ TDoV, the other main date the transgender and gender-expansive community observes\
  \ is November 20: Transgender Day of Remembrance, memorializing those we’ve lost.\
  \ Before the recent wave of legislation targeting transgender and gender-expansive\
  \ people, the attempted suicide rate among people who identified as such was around\
  \ 50%. Unfortunately, with the current attempts to deny gender-affirming care, this\
  \ number will likely only go up. </p> \n     <p>So I say this: to hell with keeping\
  \ us in your thoughts and prayers. Don’t wait until you lose a friend or colleague\
  \ forever before deciding to act. Transgender and gender-expansive people alone\
  \ can’t win this fight. We need your help in amplifying our voices, educating yourself\
  \ and others, donating to supportive groups, volunteering, voting out politicians\
  \ driven by hate and ignorance, and listening and providing love and support to\
  \ the transgender and gender-expansive people in your lives.</p> \n     <p>Each\
  \ of the amazing gains our community has made has been opposed by people who would\
  \ rather we stay hidden and excluded from society, or increasingly, would simply\
  \ prefer us dead. These are, and have always been, the stakes. We celebrate (and\
  \ fight for) Transgender Day of Visibility so there are fewer lives to mourn on\
  \ Transgender Day of Remembrance. </p> \n     <p></p>\n     <p style=\"margin-left:\
