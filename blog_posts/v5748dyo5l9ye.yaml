  date\">Saturday, August 16, 2008</p> \n   <p>We did it: We sold out of our entire\
  \ weekend's worth of stock of the <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy84o0\"><i>Pathfinder</i>\
  \ Roleplaying Game Beta Release</a> in less than two days. Less than one day plus\
  \ one hour, really. Ok, so less than 9 hours total. That's a lot o' copies.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>We're also mowing through <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy83la\">The Gamers:\
  \ Dorkness Rising</a> DVDs so fast that we had to have another very, very, very\
  \ large quantity overnighted to us here at the show—a quantity that ends in three\
  \ zeros.</p> \n   <p>At opening today we had only four copies of the <a href=\"\
  /store/paizo/v5748btpy80ic\"><i>Pathfinder Chronicles</i> Campaign Setting</a> hardcover\
  \ remaining; they sold out quickly.</p> \n   <p>Now that's I'm done showering you\
  \ with OUR accolades and successes, let me show you YOUR successes:</p> \n   <p><a\

  9\" vspace=\"6\" align=\"left\"></a> <br><br>Shot 1 of the Pathfinder Society Organized\
  \ Play room on Friday afternoon looking from the main entrance. What you see there\
  \ is a completely sold out slot—two full scenarios, 12 GMs each, 6 players per GM.\
  \ I'd like to swear here in excited glee, but I'll keep it PG and say, \"RAD!!!\"\

  \ border=\"0\" hspace=\"9\" vspace=\"6\" align=\"right\"></a> <br><br>Shot 2 of\
  \ the same room, same time, from the other entrance. The GMs that are standing are:\
  \ Michael Kortes (in white and red, front), Knight Errant JR from the Paizo boards\
  \ (in white t-shirt, middle), clight101 from the Paizo boards (just over JR's shoulder,\
  \ in grey), SheKaKa67 from the Paizo boards (black hat, top left), Lilith from the\
  \ boards (back right corner, green shirt), and Greg Vaughan (far right, green and\
  \ white striped shirt). There are many GMs in this picture from the boards—these\
  \ are the ones I can pick out of the picture.</p> \n   <p>Our community is awesome,\
  \ and without our community's awesomeness, we wouldn't be around. That's YOUR success,\
  \ community—being our support and our rock at shows like Gen Con (and stores, homes,\
  \ and cons beyond).</p> \n   <p>Keep spreading the word.</p> \n   <p>My hat's off\
  \ to you.</p> \n   <p>Joshua J. Frost<br> Director of Marketing</p> \n  </blockquote>\
