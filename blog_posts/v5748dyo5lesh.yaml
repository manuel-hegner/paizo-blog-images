  \   <p class=\"date\">by Chris A. Jackson</p> \n   <h2>Chapter Three: Blood and\
  \ Information</h2> \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"\
  description\">It was late, and the doors of Gozreh's temple were closed, but it\
  \ was not so late that a bit of judicious knocking didn't get a response. A young\
  \ acolyte cracked the door and squinted at Torius dubiously.</span></p> \n    <p>\"\
  Yes?\"</p> \n    <p>\"We need to speak to the high priest immediately!\" Torius\
  \ gestured to the stiff form in Grogul's arms. \"My friend...\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  The high priest is eating his supper.\" The acolyte seemed unmoved by the plea.\
  \ \"Perhaps tomorrow.\"</p> \n    <p>\"We are faithful to Gozreh!\" He produced\
  \ the small golden leaf on a chain from the neck of his robes. \"And we are not\
  \ without resources.\" A handful of gold reinforced the plea, and gained them entry.\
  \ </p> \n    <p>Like all temples to Gozreh that Torius had seen, this one was open\
  \ to the sky, its walls of joined driftwood servin...g only to keep out the unfaithful,\
  \ not the elements. In its center sat the traditional large pool of water, surrounded\
  \ by native plant life. Katapesh being Katapesh, however, this particular temple\
  \ was far from the humble hermitages and shrines one might find on a distant coast\
  \ or otherwise uninhabited island. The head priest wore fine robes, and looked as\
  \ if it had been some time since he last slept out under the open sky. He sat at\
  \ a beautiful wooden table next to the reflecting pool, and looked none too pleased\
  \ at being interrupted.</p> \n    <p>\"It's late, Captain.\" The aged priest wiped\
  \ the grease of his curried goat stew from his long beard. He squinted down at Snick's\
  \ corpse as if it somehow offended him. \"And there is no hurry. Perhaps in the\
  \ morning.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I've donated enough to your coffers in years past to\
  \ buy this temple thrice over,\" Torius seethed, one hand clenching the hilt of\
  \ his cutlass. \"We urgently require information that our friend may have learned\
  \ just prior to her death. I'm willing to pay whatever you deem fair.\"</p> \n \
  \   <p>\"Oh. Well, information comes easier than treatment of her... um... condition.\
  \ For a generous donation to the temple, we may be able to accommodate you.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"How generous?\" Grogul growled, his flinty eyes narrow.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  And before you answer, consider my longstanding, and potential <i>future</i> support\
  \ of this temple.\" Torius reached for his belt pouch.</p> \n    <p>After some haggling,\
  \ they came to an agreement, and the priest led them across the garden and over\
  \ to a stone slab, deeply engraved with the Gozreh's leaf symbol.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Place her there.\"</p> \n    <p>When Grogul complied, the priest produced a matching\
  \ leaf pendant from his robes and began a careful incantation. The symbol glowed\
  \ with a deep blue light, and Snick's morbid features suddenly stirred. Sightless\
  \ eyes blinked, and her mouth twitched, but her color remained the ashen hue of\
  \ death. Grogul muttered an oath and took a step back.</p> \n    <p>\"Ask your questions,\"\
  \ the priest instructed.</p> \n    <p>\"Snick!\" He stepped forward. \"Snick, I\
  \ need to know where they took Celeste!\"</p> \n    <p>\"Celeste...\" The gnome's\
  \ voice was raspy, undoubtedly the result of being garroted. \"They took her...\
  \ Don't know where.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I need to know about Caliel. What did he do\
  \ with Celeste?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Caliel!\" Her sightless eyes flung wide, pale lips\
  \ drawn back in a rictus snarl, she hissed, \"Traitor! He sold her to a man.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Torius' blood ran cold in his veins. \"To who? Who paid him?\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"Don't know... Didn't see his face... Wizard.\" </p> \n    <p>\"Blast!\"\
  \ Torius clenched his fists and thought furiously. \"Do you know where Caliel's\
  \ gone to?\"</p> \n    <p>\"No. South... Told his men Grand Arch at dawn.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Good! Thank you, Snick.\" He rested a hand on her cool shoulder. \"\
  You rest now.\"</p> \n    <p>The spell faded, and Snick's pale features stilled.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"It will be expensive to bring her back, Captain,\" the priest warned.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"I don't care. I'll pay it.\" Torius looked up at the heavens and a\
  \ shiver wracked his body. Could Celeste see the stars she so loved? Would she ever\
  \ observe the night sky again? He knew what she would become if that was denied\
  \ her for too long. He turned away without another glance at the priest. \"Come\
  \ on, Grogul. We've got to get back to the ship. We've got an appointment at the\
  \ Grand Arch at dawn.\"</p> \n    <p align=\"center\">∗∗∗</p> \n    <p>The crewmembers\
  \ of the <i>Stargazer</i> were with him. Pirates they might be, but loyalty to one\
  \ another was the key to their success and survival, and avarice was in their blood.\
  \ Consequently, the opportunities to repay the treason of fellow crewmembers and\
  \ reap a share of Caliel's payment for the sale of their navigator were serious\
  \ incentives. </p> \n    <p>Well before dawn, Torius, Grogul and a dozen pirates\
  \ were hidden among the simple homes along the road between Twilight Gate and the\
  \ Grand Arch Bridge. Just as the sun peeked over the sea, seven desert-cloaked riders\
  \ exited the gate astride fine mounts and headed toward the bridge.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Horses,\" Grogul muttered with a note of disdain. \"Figured that and brung a little\
  \ surprise.\" He delved into a large bag and withdrew a heavy bola.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Where'd you learn to use a thing like that?\" Torius eyed the ungainly device dubiously.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Wasn't always a pirate, Captain,\" the bosun replied with a grin.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Fine. Just don't tip our hand.\" He watched the riders closely; they\
  \ wore dust cloths across their faces, but he knew Caliel when he came close enough.\
  \ When they were in position, he gave a high-pitched whistle and stepped into the\
  \ street in front of the horses. Half his sailors stepped out beside him, and the\
  \ rest filled the street behind the riders. Every pirate bore a loaded crossbow.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"That's as far as you go, you mutinous piece of dog meat!\" Torius drew\
  \ his sword and the riders pulled their mounts to a halt.</p> \n    <p>\"Vin! How\
  \ in the depths of Hell—\"</p> \n    <p>\"The shipmate you murdered gave us just\
  \ enough information to find you, Caliel. Snick isn't here to cut her due out of\
  \ your traitorous hide, but I'll wager you got enough from selling my navigator\
  \ to pay a cleric for her return.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Snick's dead?\" Honest surprise\
  \ registered in the half-elf's eyes. \"Nosey gnome. I didn't mean for that to happen,\
  \ Torius. She killed herself with her own damned curiosity.\"</p> \n    <p>\"You\
  \ might sell that to the dung collectors, but not to me, Caliel. I'll make you a\
  \ deal. If you drop the gold you made from selling my navigator and tell me who\
  \ you sold her to, I'll let you be on your cowardly way. Otherwise...\" He gestured\
  \ to the bowmen.</p> \n    <p>\"Your <i>navigator</i> is a scaly monster, Vin!\"\
  \ The man hefted a long spear. \"And you're the coward! No stomach to be a <i>real</i>\
  \ pirate! We could have made <i>twice</i> what we got on that last take if you had\
  \ any stones! A hold full of silks and fifteen new slaves would have paid well,\
  \ and nobody would have been the wiser!\"</p> \n    <p>\"I told you when you came\
  \ aboard that I don't deal in people,\" Torius said, his voice low and dangerous\
  \ as he hefted his silver-hilted cutlass. \"And there wasn't time to take anything\
  \ more. You know that.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Because you don't have the balls to kill\
  \ a bunch of bloody merchants!\" Caliel hawked and spat. \"Did that scaly witch\
  \ of yours chew off your manhood, <i>Captain</i> Vin? Is that why you're so craven?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Tell me who you sold her to, Caliel, or I swear by Gozreh, I'll\
  \ take your head.\"</p> \n    <p>\"You mean you'll try!\" The riders kicked their\
  \ mounts into a charge, spears set like lances.</p> \n    <p>\"Fire all!\" Torius\
  \ shouted, and the crossbows cracked.</p> \n    <p>Three men fell, but Caliel and\
  \ the others rode on. There was not a faint heart among his crew, but pirates are\
  \ unaccustomed to facing a cavalry charge. They dove out of the way; only Grogul\
  \ remained, his tusks bared as he threw his bola. One of the horses went down screaming,\
  \ its rider pitching forward to land with a sickening crunch.</p> \n    <p>Torius\
  \ stood his ground, reaching for a pouch at his hip. He focused on the gleaming\
  \ tip of Caliel's spear and threw the pouch down hard, right in the horse's path.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>It was just a simple firecracker, but the sound spooked the horse, which\
  \ threw off Caliel's aim enough to save Torius's life. The tip of the spear creased\
  \ the captain's shoulder, but his cutlass caught the traitorous first mate squarely\
  \ in the stomach. Caliel fell from the saddle and landed in a bloody heap.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Another horse screamed in agony, and Torius heard Grogul bellow, but his\
  \ attention was fixed on Caliel. He dashed to where the man lay clutching the slithering\
  \ mass of his eviscerated abdomen. </p> \n    <p>He put the tip of his cutlass to\
  \ his first mate's throat and said, \"Who'd you sell her to? Tell me!\"</p> \n \
  \   <p>\"Or what?\" Caliel spat, his lips flecked with blood. \"You'll kill me?\"\
  \ He laughed horribly, then coughed, choking on his own blood.</p> \n    <p>\"Or\
  \ by Gozreh, your soul gets bound and sold to the foulest necromancer I can find.\"\
  \ He withdrew an ornate crystal vial from his belt—nothing but an empty perfume\
  \ bottle, but Caliel didn't know that—and pressed the tip of his cutlass into Caliel's\
  \ neck. \"There are things worse than death, my friend.\"</p> \n    <p>\"A poison-crafter\
  \ named Brojanni. Offered me enough for my own ship... The money's on my horse.\"\
  \ Caliel grinned through the blood. \"You said you'd let me live.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  I lied.\" Torius allowed the man a moment's realization before he ended his life\
  \ in one quick slash. It was better than he deserved.</p> \n    <p>\"Captain!\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Torius turned to see Grogul standing over a dead horse and rider.\
  \ Blood dripped from both his axe and the spear that transfixed his thigh. The boatswain\
  \ reached down and snapped the spearhead off, then yanked the shaft free. Torius\
  \ swallowed.</p> \n    <p>\"One got away.\" The half-orc pointed to the bridge where\
  \ the last of the traitorous pirates was riding at full gallop.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  I got what I needed, Grogul.\" He cleaned his sword and sheathed it. \"Have the\
  \ men round up the horses, and bind up that leg. Our traitorous first mate just\
  \ supplied us with sufficient funds to bring Snick back and heal your hairy carcass\
  \ up in the bargain.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Bah! Just a poke with a stick!\" the boatswain\
  \ claimed, barely limping as he shouted orders at the pirate crew.</p> \n    <p\

  ></a>\n     <br>Not even death fazes Snick.\n    </div> \n    <p>\"This isn't good,\
  \ Captain.\" Snick huddled in a blanket, her face flushed a living hue as she recovered\
  \ from her brush with death. \"Not only is Brojanni a wizard, he's an alchemist\
  \ specializing in poisons, which explains why he wanted Celeste! And he's alchemist\
  \ guild. The Pactmasters won't like it if we storm his fancy home.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  I'm guild, too, and he stole my navigator!\"</p> \n    <p>\"You're guild?\" Grogul\
  \ asked, taking another swig of his medicinal fish oil whiskey. The smell of it\
  \ nearly made Torius retch.</p> \n    <p>\"Merchantmen's guild,\" Torius explained.\
  \ \"Can't sell anything in this city without it.\"</p> \n    <p>\"That's not going\
  \ to do you much good, Captain, because technically, he didn't steal Celeste. He\
  \ <i>bought</i> her, which is perfectly legal.\" Snick shivered and clutched her\
  \ blanket closer. \"The masks won't like it if you kill him.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I\
  \ don't want to <i>kill</i> him, Snick. I just want Celeste back.\" Torius suppressed\
  \ a shiver of his own, and began to wonder why he was feeling like he'd just woken\
  \ up from a two-day binge.</p> \n    <p>\"So we go in quick, take her, and give\
  \ him a swig of that memory-enema potion,\" Grogul suggested, taking another deep\
  \ draught.</p> \n    <p>Torius swallowed hard and tried to think. Grogul's idea\
  \ wasn't half bad, but they would have to make sure it happened like that, quick\
  \ and without repercussions. The last thing he needed was to tangle with the Pactmasters.\
  \ Katapesh was his home port; if he lost his standing here, he'd be cast adrift.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Okay, we do like Grogul suggested. Quick in and out, and the good Master\
  \ Brojanni doesn't even remember that we were there.\" He shivered again.</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"You okay, Captain?\" Grogul squinted at him.</p> \n    <p>\"I'm fine.\"\
  \ He reached for a bottle of spiced rum that he kept for his own medicinal purposes.\
  \ \"Snick, I think we'll need to bring your babies out of bed for this one, and\
  \ I'll need to make a trip to the Repository. We'll need gold to do this right.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"How much gold?\" Grogul's eyes narrowed in worry.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  All of it, I think.\" Torius suppressed another shiver. \"When you confront a spellcaster,\
  \ it's best to have a few tricks on hand.\"</p> \n    <p><b>Coming Next Week:</b>\
