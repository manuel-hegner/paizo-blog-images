  \  <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">“A new game?” Kesara asked, her\
  \ old Vudrani hands already sweeping the drouge pieces off the embroidered cloth,\
  \ milk-pale jade and black onyx figurines vanishing like magician’s coins between\
  \ her bony fingers.</p> \n     <p>Guan Kai shrugged, smiling, and uncapped his flask\
  \ of blackdream liqueur. He waved it at Kesara, chuckling when she wrinkled her\
  \ nose in disgust at the offer, as she always did. Unoffended, Guan Kai sipped the\
  \ murky, anise-scented drink. “What choice do I have? You’ve cleared the board.\
  \ Just when I was winning, too.”</p> \n     <p>“There was no winning that game.”\
  \ Kesara dealt new pieces onto the cloth with the swift flourishes of a professional\
  \ gambler, which Guan Kai supposed she was, after a fashion. “This one will be better.\
  \ New pieces, new board. Very friendly.” With a motion, Kesara substituted the black\
  \ jackals from the original set with a pair of lions from her near-inexhaustible\
  \ supply of alternate pieces. Playfully, she set two pennies carefully on the lions’\
  \ heads like little copper crowns, then spun them with a flick of her fingertips.\
  \ The metal disks twirled momentarily atop the figures before clattering dully onto\
  \ the cloth.</p> \n     <p><em>So</em>, Guan Kai thought, <em>she wants to bargain\
  \ a secret about some instability in Taldor.</em></p> \n     <p>“Speaking of friends,”\
  \ Kesara asked casually, “do you still have yours in the Chrysanthemum Court?”</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Guan Kai took another pull from his flask. “Naturally. A man as old\
  \ as I either has no friends, or too many to count. One’s habits add up to the sum\
  \ of one’s life, as the sages say.”</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n   \

  \ \n     <br> \n     <p>“Do they? I wouldn’t know. I’m a dewy spring blossom, myself.”\
  \ Kesara’s eyes vanished into her wrinkles when she laughed. She plucked the white\
  \ jade elephants from the board and made a show of hesitating before she replaced\
  \ them. “Now which of my little pieces would best serve your side? I presume, after\
  \ a lifetime’s likeability, you could name 16 close friends in the Court?”</p> \n\
  \     <p>She was feeling him out, trying to see which of the Successor States of\
  \ Lung Wa might offer the best price for her information. Guan Kai pretended to\
  \ ignore the bait. It was ridiculous for him to offer anything; Kesara hadn’t even\
  \ hinted what secret she was trying to sell. How could he know who wanted it? “\
  I’m an easy man to like. Even in Shenmen, I might find a few friends.”</p> \n  \
  \   <p>“Oh, no, not Shenmen. Just the name of that haunted place gives me chills.”\
  </p> \n     <p>“No need to worry. It’s very far from here.” Information about the\
  \ Imperial Court of Taldor was unlikely to be of value to the Successor States,\
  \ he meant.</p> \n     <p>“The Court isn’t far at all.” Kesara lifted her chin,\
  \ nodding to the high white tower of the Starstone Cathedral behind them. “Just\
  \ on the other side of that great gaudy sundial.”</p> \n     <p>Ah, so her secret\
  \ wasn’t being dangled for the Successor States themselves, but for their envoys.\
  \ The Chrysanthemum Court was the unofficial embassy for dignitaries from all the\
  \ many kingdoms of Tian Xia. Business that was too risky or sordid to pass through\
  \ diplomatic channels often wound up there.</p> \n     <p>This game had suddenly\
  \ become more interesting. Guan Kai took another sip from his flask, then capped\
  \ it with a flourish and set it aside. His blood was warm enough without the liquor.\
  \ “I can hardly choose a piece without seeing the sample available for selection.”\
  </p> \n     <p>“I suppose that’s fair.” Rather than offering him a choice of white\
  \ pieces, however, Kesara plucked an onyx boar from her case and set it between\
  \ the lions. It was an ugly, pugnacious thing, its glittering tusks thrust out in\
  \ belligerent menace.</p> \n     <p>Baronet Ghazolain. His family crest carried\
  \ a boar against crossed spears, and he’d recently arrived in Absalom as part of\
  \ the Taldan diplomatic delegation. Scarcely a month had passed since the baronet\
  \ arrived in the City at the Center of the World, yet already foul rumors followed\
  \ him. Tales abounded of stained altars covered in clandestine artifacts, inhuman\
  \ chants and cries from his quarters at night, and grim-faced servants who nursed\
  \ unexplained wounds and then disappeared altogether.</p> \n     <p>Or so people\
  \ said. Guan Kai had learned to dismiss most such rumors—they were true only rarely,\
  \ and useful even less. But now, it made sense why Kesara was angling for a buyer\
  \ from the Successor States: the baronet was also said to be urgently litigating\
  \ some kind of family claim in Amanadar, a former Taldan colony now counted among\
  \ the 16 Successor States of Lung Wa.</p> \n     <p>“Interesting,” Guan Kai said.\
  \ “I would have thought the boar should go on my side.”</p> \n     <p>“I assure\
  \ you, the boar is opposed to any piece you might choose,” Kesara said. Her rheumy\
  \ eyes were sharp and intense beneath their clouds of age as she split her fingers\
  \ into a triangle around the boar’s head. An old sign, from when they’d first played\
  \ at spycraft, as children.</p> \n     <p><em>Danger</em>. Danger that would seize\
  \ your throat and twist your head off without trying.</p> \n     <p>Guan Kai smiled.\
  \ “Really? Fascinating. Then I shall choose a devil, for a beast so fearsome deserves\
  \ an equally formidable foe.” He’d kept his answer malleable on purpose. The devil\
  \ could certainly represent Chu Ye, ruled by oni, but it could just as easily mean\
  \ Cheliax. The Western devil-binders were always willing to pay for dangerous secrets,\
  \ even those that didn’t concern them.</p> \n     <p>Kesara shook her head. Her\
  \ gaze lingered on a pair of dogs pulling a wagon in the street. The animals greeted\
  \ one another cheerfully, interrupting their own work to wag tails and exchange\
  \ sniffs. “Look there, behind you. Some creatures understand the value of loyalty.\
  \ Some people, too. I said this should be a friendly game—you’d be well advised\
  \ to keep only true friends on your board, and fiends are never that. But, of course,\
  \ you’re free to choose the pieces that suit your strategy. I can only make suggestions.”\
  </p> \n     <p><em>Ah, so</em>. Guan Kai felt peculiarly warmed by Kesara’s warning.\
  \ Seventy years they’d played the game together, though she owed him no favors.\
  \ They’d been rivals as often as allies, and each had betrayed the other far too\
  \ many times for any attempt at tallying to be worthwhile.</p> \n     <p>Still,\
  \ in this, she warned him. This information was too explosive to be entrusted to\
  \ treacherous hands.</p> \n     <p>And now he understood. Kesara didn’t want to\
  \ sell her secret after all. She wanted help. Baronet Ghazolain was involved in\
  \ something so terrible that the 10,000 whisperers of Jalmeray were reaching out\
  \ to Guan Kai, and his friends, for aid. And they were sending that request as secretly\
  \ as they knew how, lest the baronet’s spies catch a whisper of their plea.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“Very well,” Guan Kai said. “I choose the dragon and the rat.”</p> \n\
  \     <p>Kesara nodded. A tiny knot of tension softened in her shoulders. <em>She\
  \ must be terrified</em>, Guan Kai thought, <em>if her worry shows so plainly</em>.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>But Kesara had spent 70 years learning to control such fear, and her\
  \ voice was calm as aloe. “Let our game begin.”</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p\
