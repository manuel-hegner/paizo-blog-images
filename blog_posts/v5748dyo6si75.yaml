  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">...I and Wes Schneider took\
  \ over the big conference room at Paizo and began to work out what Pathfinder Adventure\
  \ Path was going to do to follow up its first official campaign for the Pathfinder\
  \ Roleplaying game. We knew we wanted to do a sandbox-based Adventure Path (in part\
  \ because we were excited by the challenge, and in part because there was a lot\
  \ of call and request for something like that from Pathfinder gamers at large),\
  \ and by the end of an afternoon-suddenly-become-evening-without-us-noticing, we’\
  d sketched out Kingmaker, the idea for building a kingdom, the grid-based settlement-construction\
  \ concept, and the basic ideas for the region in which the campaign would take place.\
  \ I went on to craft the outline for the Adventure Path and started hiring authors,\
  \ while Wes focused on writing a detailed gazetteer for the Stolen Lands that would\
  \ appear in the <em>Guide to the River Kingdoms</em> alongside the launch of <em>Kingmaker</em>\
  \ itself.</p> \n     <p><em>Kingmaker</em> would go on to become one of our most\
  \ successful Adventure Paths, inspiring not only a novel, but two different video\
  \ games and eventually the core of an entire rulebook, <em>Ultimate Campaign</em>.\
  \ Going back to revise it all was a huge lift, but at the same time, there was a\
  \ sense of comfort and nostalgia as I returned to the original adventures. Memories\
  \ of the scramble to get the first volume, Stolen Lands, done in time to get it\
  \ to the printer returned as well—I had the help of author Tim Hitchcock to create\
  \ the central encounters for this adventure on a VERY tight schedule but wrote a\
  \ fair-sized chunk of the framing and “connective tissue” to bring together the\
  \ Stag Lord’s Fort, the Sootscale Kobolds, and more into one sandbox to explore.\
  \ Beyond this, though, the task of finishing off the remaining five adventures fell\
  \ to other amazing authors.</p> \n     <p>So, without further ado, let me share\
  \ some of the memories several of the original Kingmaker Adventure Path’s authors\
  \ had when they looked back on their time helping to create one of Paizo’s most\
  \ beloved campaigns!</p> \n     <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold;\

  \ Run Red</b><br> Working on <em>Kingmaker</em> happened at a time of some major\
  \ changes in my life, so I have some strong memories associated with it. <em>Rivers\
  \ Run Red</em> was the second Adventure Path volume I wrote for Paizo, and I loved\
  \ having the opportunity to put in homages to some classic wilderness adventures\
  \ I had played when I was younger. I was also writing the adventure just before\
  \ my wedding, and to top everything off, I was on my honeymoon when Paizo offered\
  \ me a job!</p> \n     <p>A few months later, following a move from Europe back\
  \ to the USA that was longer than a trek through the Stolen Lands, I found myself\
  \ working on <em>Kingmaker</em> as an editor. I felt privileged to contribute to\
  \ the AP not only as an adventure author, but also as an editor, helping to craft\
  \ and polish what I still believe is one of the best sandbox wilderness adventure\
  \ campaigns out there. I’m super pleased to see it updated to Pathfinder Second\
  \ Edition, giving gamers a whole new chance to chart their destinies and build kingdoms\
  \ of their own! </p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Jason Nelson</h3> \n     <p><b>War of\
  \ the River Kings</b><br> Kingmaker was a ton of fun to work on, blending PC-level\
  \ adventure with kingdom-level threats and high-level skullduggery. I started with\
  \ the tournament, building out not just standard medieval events but also adding\
  \ some wahoo flair suited to high-level characters in a magical world. The villain\
  \ was different, too, with Irovetti as a bombastic foil for the PCs, a braggart\
  \ and pretender but treacherous and dangerous, putting himself forward as this gracious\
  \ neighbor and really showing them a good time while working to stab them in the\
  \ back. I never even really saw him as evil, just a rival who had his own ambitions\
  \ and saw the PCs were in the way. The warfare was a challenge because while we\
  \ had all the basics of the kingdom rules, we really didn't have the specifics of\
  \ mass combat done yet, so the original version was more event-based, I think with\
  \ the villains using fey magic to flood the heroes' capital city. My lasting memory\
  \ of writing my adventure, though, was somewhat bittersweet, as my brother Brian\
  \ passed away shortly before I finished it. He and I had picked up the hobby together\
  \ as kids, and even in his final months, we got together with my kids and played\
  \ a few more times. I appreciated Paizo including a dedication to him in the original\
  \ adventure.</p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Richard Pett</h3> \n     <p><b>Sound of\
  \ a Thousand Screams</b> I’m beyond excited about seeing <em>Kingmaker</em> released\
  \ as another fabulous Paizo super-tome and updated to fit Pathfinder Second Edition.\
  \ What a fantastic adventure path to work on with such talented folks.</p> \n  \
  \   <p>One of the things I particularly recall about those days was the Adventure\
  \ Path segment outlines were much more raw, just over a paragraph of backstory for\
  \ my section with, “A great menace coming over the PCs’ realm and the nymph’s followers\
  \ harassing the PCs. With First World blooms heralding the arrival of the nymph.”\
  </p> \n     <p>My first draft synopsis was a long way from the finished article.\
  \ I did like that title though.</p> \n     <p>The line that really strikes me as\
  \ joyful in looking over the old emails from the wonderful Wes was, “You’ve got\
  \ a TON of flexibility here, so make it cool.”</p> \n     <p>Well, I hope the <em>Sound\
  \ of a Thousand Screams</em> is cool, the sparking ideas back and forth—throwing\
  \ in the jabberwock for example—was such great fun, and whilst this adventure sticks\
  \ out as one of the hardest to complete (writing <em>Wormwood Mutiny</em> was slightly\
  \ trickier with so many untouchable NPCs in a low-level adventure), it was certainly\
  \ the most rewarding.</p> \n     <p>The really wonderful thing about working with\
  \ such talented folks was seeing how the adventure developed and how James performed\
  \ his incredible magic on my final draft—soaking the adventure with <em>Bestiary\
  \ 2</em> monsters and dragons to name but two things.</p> \n     <p>It was such\
  \ a great honor to be a part of this wonderful AP and the Paizo family. Thank you,\
  \ James, and thank you, Wes.</p> \n     <p>Huzzah!</p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Neil\
  \ Spicer</h3> \n     <p><b>Blood for Blood</b><br> Writing for <em>Kingmaker</em>\
  \ felt like the culmination of a long-held dream and a trial by fire. It was a banner\
  \ year for me in 2009. I’d won RPG Superstar. I’d finished my turnover for <em>Realm\
  \ of the Fellnight Queen</em>. And, like every other freelancer, I hoped to someday\
  \ write for the flagship product line, but fully expected I’d have to work my way\
  \ up to it over many months or years. Then, out of the blue, Wes Schneider asked\
  \ if I could take on 30,000 words in two months because <em>Kingmaker</em>had fallen\
  \ behind. My exact words to him were: “HOLY CRAP!!! Are you freakin’ serious!?!?!?\
  \ Yes! YES! A thousand times YES!” I know, because I kept the email. That’s how\
  \ much it meant to me. I gave everything I could to it, thundering into my word\
  \ count like a raging barbarian, knowing I couldn’t let Paizo down. It was my first\
  \ BIG assignment. It tested me in all the right ways. I learned so much from it,\
  \ and I’ll always be grateful for that opportunity.</p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Greg\
  \ A. Vaughan</h3> \n     <p><b>The Varnhold Vanishing</b><br> What to say about\
  \ designing <em>The Varnhold Vanishing</em>? It came at a perfect time when I was\
  \ wanting to explore several very different ideas in an adventure or adventures:\
  \ I was interested in doing something Roanoke-ish... check. And I really liked the\
  \ idea of a settlement/fortress less well-established than the usual stone keep\
  \ that had become sort of the adventure standard, something with more of a colonial\
  \ America feel to it like the blockhouse and stockade at Varnhold... check, check.\
  \ I had recently read Pressfield’s <em>Last of the Amazons</em>, and the chance\
  \ to do something with steppes horsefolk really appealed to me as well, not to mention\
  \ his description of the “Gate to Hell” giving the perfect entry to Vordakai’s tomb...\
  \ check, check, check! The growing setting that was Golarion and its first foray\
  \ into a sandbox-style world exploration with <em>Kingmaker</em> gave me the opportunity\
  \ to do it all at once, and with a powerful undead cyclops to boot. What more could\
  \ you ask for?</p> \n    </blockquote> \n   </div> <!-- tags: Community, Authors,\
