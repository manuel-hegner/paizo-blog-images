  \ \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">As we brainstorm adventures, the team often\
  \ comes up with ideas that we have to shelve for months or even years before they\
  \ come to fruition. When we were looking at our season's schedule months ago, we\
  \ had several open Tier 3-7 slots, and at long last there was the opportunity to\
  \ realize one of my dream two-part series that's perfect for the Halloween season.\
  \ It's been floating in my head since a shortly after <a href=\"/products/btpy93m4?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-5-16-Destiny-of-the-Sands-Part-3-Sanctum-of-the-Sages\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #5-16: Destiny of the Sands, Part 3: Sanctum of\
  \ the Sages</em></a>, which has a somewhat famous and temporary character augmentation.\
  \ The idea that we could use that concept for something as strange as a monstrous\
  \ template, though... that's always been a bit of a dream. Thankfully, Linda was\
  \ ready to take the lead on developing our Mysteries Under Moonlight series, and\
  \ she's going to jump in to say some more.</p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <div\

  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #10-07: Mysteries Under Moonlight, Part 2: The\
  \ Howling Dance</em></a>, a Tier 3-7 scenario by Crystal Malarsky. Crystal has a\
  \ real knack for atmosphere, which is perfect for this spooky adventure. Race into\
  \ the haunted Mushfens swamp on the trail of an evil being who has been spreading\
  \ corruption through Magnimar and beyond. Save innocent spirits from a creeping\
  \ malevolence, face your fears, and put an end to a terrifying ruler. Trust me,\
  \ the grinning skull surrounded by tormented spirits so delightfully illustrated\
  \ by Leonardo Santanna does not have your PCs's best interests in mind.</p> \n \

  \  <p style=\"clear: both;\">My first love in the Pathfinder campaign setting was\
  \ far and away Katapesh, both where my first AP experience takes place in Legacy\
  \ of Fire, but also the adopted home of my first Pathfinder Society character. We've\

  /products/btpy9tld?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-900-Assault-on-Absalom\"><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Society Special #9-00: Assault on Absalom</em></a>, and Katapesh feels like the\

  \ Society: organizing his own retirement party! It's not all fun and games though,\
  \ as the PCs must navigate a treacherous web of ambition, betrayal, and worse when\

  \ the half-orc potions merchant Phlegos Dulm, finally comes to a head as each makes\
