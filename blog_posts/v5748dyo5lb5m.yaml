  > \n    <p>Only those who refuse to see truth are truly blind. Such is the verdict\
  \ of Alahazra, bride of the sun and prophet of the burning sands.</p>\n    <p> </p>\n\
  \    <p>Alahazra was born in a small Rahadoumi town east of Manaket, one of the\
  \ many way stations on the caravan route known as the Path of Salt, which leads\
  \ from Azir all the way to distant Sothis and takes its name from the waves of the\
  \ Inner Sea and the dried tears of the slave chains that march along it. The daughter\
  \ of a wealthy and widowed wainwright, Alahazra wanted for nothing, growing up with\
  \ the best tutors money could buy, all the time being groomed for a potentially\
  \ lucrative marriage, or perhaps even induction into the Occularium, Manaket's prestigious\
  \ wizard's college.</p> \n    <p>All of that changed on the morning when sixteen-year-old\
  \ Alahazra woke to find herself suddenly and inexplicably blind, her eyes clouded\
  \ by a white mist that gave her only vague outlines of her surroundings. Beside\
  \ himself with grief, her father called in the best healers to be found in the godless\
  \ land, only to discover that the situation was worse than he could have imagined.\
  \ For when the bards with the healing touch reached out to the fevered child, they\
  \ were suddenly cast back by a blast of flames that burned the girl's sickbed but\
  \ left her magically unharmed. Yet even this might have been bearable, had the fleeing\
  \ bards not revealed the rest of their discovery: that the girl's flames bore no\
  \ hint of sorcery or arcana. Though Alahazra's staunchly atheist father could scarcely\
  \ believe it, his proper Rahadoumi household harbored a burgeoning cleric.</p> \n\

  \   </table>\n  </div> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>Confronted by her enraged father\
  \ and frightened by the new abilities that she felt burning inside her skin, Alahazra\
  \ protested her innocence loud and long, but to no avail. Sickened by what he saw\
  \ as a betrayal of both his trust and his national pride, Alahazra's father did\
  \ his daughter a final kindness and cast her out with no more than the clothes on\
  \ her back, instructing her to run before the Pure Legion arrived to take her into\
  \ custody—and let her gods be her new family, for she no longer had one in Rahadoum.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Blind, weak, and weeping with frustration and rage, Alahazra stumbled\
  \ southeast into the desert, seeking what meager shade and water the badlands had\
  \ to offer. For days she wandered, seeking only to put distance between herself\
  \ and any pursuers who might still seek revenge for her presumed heresy, until at\
  \ last she collapsed in the lee of a dune, dehydrated and dying.</p> \n   <p>It\
  \ was there, staring up through milky cataracts at the burning ball of the sun and\
  \ letting the wind slowly bury her in the hot sand of the dunes, that Alahazra had\
  \ her first revelation. Behind those ruined eyes, a vision of debilitating color\
  \ suddenly exploded. In it, Alahazra saw herself not as she was, but as she one\
  \ day would be—strong, proud, and fierce. In that moment, Alahazra understood that\
  \ she was more than just a girl. She was a force of the desert—a voice of sun, sand,\
  \ and flame—and she would bring its truth to the people, whether they were ready\
  \ for it or not. Baking slowly in the hot coals of the great Garundi desert, Alahazra\
  \ came to know herself, and in doing so first harnessed the magical flames that\
  \ had been building inside her.</p> \n   <p>With the aid of her newfound abilities,\
  \ Alahazra moved steadily east, crossing into Thuvia and following the Path of Salt\
  \ until she finally came to rest in Osirion. There she roamed as she willed through\
  \ the great cities and barren plains, offering wisdom and healing to the righteous\
  \ and cleansing fire to the wicked. In time, her notoriety grew, offering her passage\
  \ into higher social circles, and it's whispered that she made consorts and admirers\
  \ of several powerful men, possibly even entering the court of the Ruby Prince.\
  \ Alahazra herself, however, speaks little of her past. For her, only the future\
  \ is a concern, and her duty is to defend it as best she can, with a clarity of\
  \ vision that disdains sight.</p> \n   <p>Now a grown woman, and still attractive\
  \ enough to turn the heads of slaves and rich men alike, Alahazra is kind but distant,\
  \ often letting conversation drop in favor of taking in the sounds and smells of\
  \ her environment. When she does speak, in her low, throaty voice, her words have\
  \ the weight of command. Alahazra has little patience for fools (most notably those\
  \ who let money or pride blind them to truth and justice), yet also has a soft spot\
  \ for orphans, and in her own stern way often sees herself as the mother to her\
  \ adventuring companions. Though she maintains that she has never worshiped a god—\
  the cornerstone of her bitterness toward both her father and her homeland—she has\
  \ come to respect a wide variety of deities, whom she refers to as \"powerful and\
  \ strategic allies.\" And while her detractors might call her cold, in battle Alahazra's\
  \ burning rage—especially toward injustice and intolerance—still comes roiling out\
  \ in a wall of divine flame. </p> \n   <p>James L. Sutter <br>Fiction Editor</p>\
