  \ Program Announced!</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Monday, September 26, 2016</p>\
  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Today is\
  \ special—two blogs on one day! Lots of PFS goodness! First up, a new program aimed\
  \ at rewarding purchases made at Friendly, Local Game Stores or other retail establishments\
  \ that offer Pathfinder Society space for games. This has been in the works for\
  \ some time and I am exited to reveal it to our playerbase!</p> \n    <p>Later today,\
  \ John Compton introduces the newest Pathfinder Society scenarios—<a href=\"/products/btpy9oih\"\
  ><em>#8-04 Wardens of Sulfer Gulch</em></a> and <a href=\"/products/btpy9oii\"><em>#8-05\
  \ Ungrounded But Unbroken</em></a>.</p> \n    <p>Without further ado...</p> \n \
  \   <h2>Retail Incentive Program</h2> \n    <p>Back in March, at GAMA Trade Show,\
  \ Erik and I announced a program for retailers that would encourage players to purchase\
  \ items from their stores. Since then, the PFS team drafted ideas, solicited feedback\
  \ from stores and VOs, made revisions, and are now ready to try the program. We\
  \ may need to tweak it from here, but we want to give it some time in the field\
  \ before we start making changes. Once launched, if you have feedback, post it as\
  \ a comment or email it to <a href=\"mailto:pathfindersociety@paizo.com\">pathfindersociety@paizo.com</a>.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Right now, the program is focused on the <em>Roleplaying Guild Guide</em>.\
  \ To those playing Adventure Card Guild—don't despair. We haven't forgotten you!\
  \ I just didn't want to hold the program while we explored options for card scenarios.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>In writing the program, we observed that not all PFS games are held in\
  \ FLGS space. Sometimes they are in community halls or sporting halls that also\
  \ house a refreshment stand or other sales outlet. Thus we named it retail, not\
  \ retailer, and offer it as a tool for any location with a retail outlet patronized\
  \ by Pathfinder Society players.</p> \n    <p>We realize that demographics are different\
  \ and each retail location should decide what is best for their business, thus participation\
  \ in the retail incentive program is <b>not</b> mandatory. Locations utilizing the\
  \ program should advertise its presence to their clientele.</p> \n    <p>For countries\
  \ outside the US, an approximate equivalent of local currency is used. For example,\
  \ $10 USD = 7. 67 British Pound or 13.27 Australian Dollars or 8.96 Euro, so round\
  \ to the closest .25 and use that figure. This doesn't mean you have to look up\
  \ the exchange rate each game day, just use the general exchange rate.</p> \n  \
  \  <p>Please note, the benefits gained from the retail purchase program stack with\
  \ benefits a player receives from the reroll program. </p>\n    <h3>The Details</h3>\
  \ \n    <p>This proposal grants a benefit to the entire table, scaling depending\
  \ on how much money someone spent.</p> \n    <p>Game stores and other retail locations\
  \ are an important part of the Pathfinder Society community, and it's important\
  \ to support them so that there's always a public venue for organized play events.\
  \ Players can now redeem receipts in exchange for a modest benefit shared by the\
  \ entire table—all as a way of thanking players for supporting their game stores.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Redeeming a receipt simply involves showing it to the GM, who marks the\
  \ receipt to denote that it was used. A player can only use a receipt in this way\
  \ on the same day as she made the purchase, and only for events held at that venue.\
  \ A player can acquire and redeem a receipt during play so long as doing so would\
  \ not significantly disrupt gameplay, though it must occur before an encounter begins.\
  \ The receipt need not be for Paizo products; the storeowner may include any products\
  \ the venue sells as qualifying purchases.</p> \n    <p>At any time during an event,\
  \ players may redeem receipts from their purchases worth $10 or more to gain a single-use\
  \ benefit that applies to all of the PCs at the table. If the total combined receipts\
  \ provided by one or more players are $50 or more, all players receive an enhanced\
  \ benefit. No matter how many receipts the players have, the table can never use\
  \ the same benefit more than once during a game session; they can, however, gain\
  \ both benefits during a session.</p> \n    <p>All of the PCs gain the following\
  \ benefit:</p> \n    <ul>\n     <li><i>Harder to Kill:</i> Treat the character's\
  \ Constitution as 5 points higher than normal for the purpose of determining when\
  \ hit point damage would kill him. For the enhanced benefit, treat the character's\
  \ Constitution as 10 higher.</li>\n    </ul> \n    <p>Each player may also choose\
  \ to use one of the following during the game:</p> \n    <ul>\n     <li><i>Cheaper\
  \ Healing:</i> Before the end of the session, you can use the benefit to reduce\
  \ the Prestige Point cost of one spellcasting service of the healing subschool by\
  \ 1 (minimum 0). For the enhanced benefit, you can instead reduce the cost by 2.</li>\
  \ \n     <li><i>Recover from Wounds:</i> The PC recovers hit points equal to twice\
  \ their character level. For the enhanced benefit, each PC also recovers 2 points\
  \ of ability damage to one ability score. This benefit can only be used outside\
  \ of combat.</li> \n     <li><i>Bonus Wealth:</i> If you do not use the subsidized\
  \ healing benefit above, you can instead choose to roll twice and take the higher\
  \ result when rolling a Day Job check. For the enhanced benefit, you also increase\
  \ the gold you earn from the day Job result by 50% (maximum 300 gp total).</li>\n\
  \    </ul> \n    <p>So there you have it—the Retail Incentive Program. We will update\
  \ the <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/policies\">policy section of the website</a>\
  \ as soon as possible and the policy will appear in the next version of the <em>Roleplaying\
  \ Guild Guide</em>. As this is a new program, we appreciate constructive feedback.\
  \ Remember to post it here or send it to <a href=\"mailto:pathfindersociety@paizo.com\"\
  >pathfindersociety@paizo.com</a>.</p> \n    <p>Don't forget to check back later\
  \ for John's blog!</p> \n    <p>Until next week: Explore, Report, Cooperate!</p>\
