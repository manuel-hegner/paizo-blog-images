  \     <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\"></p> \n      </div> \n      <p>This month, we\
  \ released a spooky new adventure, <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq021w2?PACS-Standalone-Adventure-1-A-Night-at-Bloodthorne-Manor\"\
  >Pathfinder Adventure Card Society #1: A Night at Bloodthorne Manor</a>, which is\
  \ a stand-alone adventure not related to the ongoing Year of Rotting Ruin plot.\
  \ When a group of children dared each other to spend a night at a dilapidated manor\
  \ house that was rumored to be haunted, most of them expected an evening of scary\
  \ stories imagining what may lurk in the darkness. But the seemingly abandoned house\
  \ was far from empty. Explore the mysteries of the manor, meet its occupants—both\
  \ living and dead—and get the children back home safe. This adventure is designed\
  \ to be particularly flexible. It’s set up for play at Tier 1, 2, 3, or 4, so you\
  \ can easily pick the level that works best for your group.</p> \n      <div class=\"\

  \ style=\"font-size: 13px;\"></p> \n      </div> \n      <p>For Pathfinder Society\
  \ (second edition) players, we released two scenarios and one quest yesterday. Organized\
  \ Play developer James Case describes March’s scenarios:</p> \n      <p>Our first\
  \ adventure this month is <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq022x0\">Pathfinder\
  \ Society (second edition) Scenario #1-14: Lions of Katapesh</a>! This repeatable\
  \ scenario for levels 1—4 by Adam Meyers features exactly what it says in the title,\
  \ as the PCs travel to Katapesh to assist goblin merchant Yigrig Moneymaker with\
  \ a problem; his expedition to build a bridge between two promising trading partners\
  \ is being attacked by lions! The heroes will have to figure out what’s causing\
  \ the cats to hunt down the goblin expedition, which is led by Yigrig’s son, Zig.</p>\

  >Pathfinder Society (second edition) Scenario #1-15: The Blooming Catastrophe</a>,\
  \ by Mikhail Rekun. In this adventure for levels 1—4, the Pathfinder Society has\
  \ their hands full as a new threat has come to Finedar Forest—a rapidly growing\
  \ population of corrupted leshys that seem Abyss-bent on attacking anyone who enters\
  \ the forest. This nature-themed adventure will be especially appropriate for heroes\
  \ aligned with the Verdant Wheel faction, whose leader, Urwal, is on-site to try\
  \ to restore the forest and figure out why the leshys seem to hate anyone wearing\
  \ a <i>wayfinder</i>.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/022720_Urwal.jpg\"\

  s quest by Dennis Muldoon is <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq022wz\">Pathfinder\
  \ Society (second edition) Quest #7: A Curious Claim</a>, for levels 3–6. The PCs\
  \ must travel to Druma to investigate an insurance claim for an “accidentally lost\
  \ shipment” that some suspect may not have been as accidental as it seems. The PCs\
  \ will have to get past both aquatic undead as well as agents dispatched by one\
  \ of the Society’s major rivals if they hope to get to the bottom of the matter.</p>\
