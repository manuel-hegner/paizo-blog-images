               <p itemprop="description">Another year is in the bag, and with it, thousands of pages of Pathfinder Roleplaying Game content, ranging from new a whole new range of psychic classes in <a href="/products/btpy9egu"><em>Occult Adventures</em></a> to facing off against the demons of the Abyss in <a href="/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/wrathOfTheRighteous"><em>Pathfinder Adventure Card Game: Wrath of the Righteous</em></a>! Here's a few highlights from 2015.</p> 
               <h2>Pathfinder Adventure Path</h2> 
               <div class="blurb180">
                <a href="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PZO1132-RampagingGolem.jpg"><img src="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PZO1132-RampagingGolem_180.jpeg"></a>
                <br>Yes, I was attracted in my younger years to the occult.
                <br><em>Illustration by Emiliano Petrozzi</em>
               </div> 
               <p>Deep within the Mindspin Mountains, a big problem stirred, kicking off the <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/giantslayer">Giantslayer Adventure Path</a> with <a href="/products/btpy9aub">"Battle of Bloodmarch Hill"</a>! As you might surmise from the title, you face a whole lotta giants in this AP, from hill to storm and pretty much all kinds in-between. The Order of the Amber Die ran the entire Giantslayer Adventure Path in six sessions, one per volume, and we <a href="/paizo/blog/tags/giantslayer">shared their exploits on the blog previously</a>. This year also saw the start of the 17th Adventure Path with <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/hellsRebels">Hell's Rebels</a>, which included the milestone 100th volume, <a href="/products/btpy9grm">"A Song of Silver"</a>!</p> 
               <h2>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game</h2> 
               <p>Jefe, what is a plethora? Four hardcover <a href="/pathfinderRPG">Pathfinder Roleplaying Game</a> books, that's what. The <a href="/products/btpy99sk"><em>Strategy Guide</em></a>, <a href="/products/btpy9c25"><em>Pathfinder Unchained</em></a>, <a href="/products/btpy9egu"><em>Occult Adventures</em></a>, and <em><a href="/products/btpy9g9x">Bestiary 5</a></em> all made its way out to fans everywhere this year, bringing a host of advice, new rules options, psychic characters, and critters a-plenty for everybody's game. The wyrmwraith proved pretty popular, winning our <a href="http://paizo.com/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5li95?Do-You-Think-Flattery-Will-Keep-You-Alive"><em>Bestiary 5</em> Battle Royale contest</a>!</p> 
               <h2>Pathfinder Campaign Setting</h2> 
               <p>Pairing nicely along with <a href="/products/btpy9egu"><em>Occult Adventures</em></a> is setting-specific releases of <a href="/products/btpy9hdt"><em>Occult Realms</em></a> and <a href="/products/btpy9g21"><em>Occult Bestiary</em></a>! Esoteric horrors and secrets await in those tomes, but there's also <a href="/products/btpy9g9v"><em>Inner Sea Races</em></a>, a hardcover compilation expanding upon the many members (and possible player characters) of the Inner Sea! The <a href=""><em>Inner Sea Monster Codex</em></a> gives a heapin' helpin' of new options for the game master as well (along with the return of the <a href="/pathfinder/accessories/maps/flipMatClassics"><em>Pathfinder Flip-Mat Classics</em></a> and a redesigned <a href="/products/btpy9fkg"><em>Combat Pad</em></a>).</p> 
               <h2>Pathfinder Module</h2> 
               <div class="blurb180">
                <a href="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderModules/PZO9549-DreamSpider.jpg"><img src="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderModules/PZO9549-DreamSpider_180.jpeg"></a>
                <br>Don't rest your head.
                <br><em>Illustration by Dave Allsop</em>
               </div> 
               <p>You may not be aware of this...but we kinda like adventure 'round these parts! <a href="/products/btpy9au7">"Daughters of Fury"</a> was penned by RPG Superstar 2014 winner Victoria Jaczko, while Nicolas Logue returned with <a href="/products/btpy9grq">"Feast of Dust"</a>, and Master of Mysticism Brandon Hodge penned <a href="/products/btpy9grs">"The House of Hook Street"</a> (which just might make you afraid to close your eyes at night). If you're looking for something level- or region-specific, don't miss out on the <a href="/pathfinder/adventureFinder">Pathfinder Adventure Finder</a>, which includes hundreds of adventures from Paizo and third-party Pathfinder publishers!</p> 
               <h2>Pathfinder Player Companion</h2> 
               <p>There were quite a few fan-favorite releases for players this year, including (but certainly not limited to) <a href="/products/btpy9e1c"><em>Cohorts &amp; Companions</em></a>, <a href="/products/btpy9c23"><em>Melee Tactics Toolbox</em></a>, and <a href="/products/btpy9hdy"><em>Weapon Master's Handbook</em></a>! Players picking up a copy of <a href="/products/btpy9egu"><em>Occult Adventures</em></a> might also want to grab <a href="/products/btpy9grw"><em>Occult Origins</em></a>, which provides new spells, feats, and rituals that tie into some of Golarion's history.</p> 
               <h2>Pathfinder Adventure Card Game</h2> 
               <p>The world-changing events of the <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/wrathOfTheRighteous">Wrath of the Righteous Adventure Path</a> made for an epic conversion to the <a href="/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/">Pathfinder Adventure Card Game</a>, and the Season of the Righteous brought the <a href="/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/wrathOfTheRighteous">Wrath of the Righteous Adventure Card Game</a> to <a href="/pathfinderSociety">organized play</a>. From lowly mortals dabbling in affairs beyond their ken to challenging demon lords in their home realms, <a href="/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/wrathOfTheRighteous">Wrath of the Righteous</a> is not for the faint-hearted heroes!</p> 
               <p>And in conclusion, here's some more art from this year's releases!</p>

                <p>Linxia Benzekri was born and raised in Khari, the Chelish enclave on the northwest corner of Garund. Although ethnically Garundi, Linxia always thought of herself as Chelaxian. After all, Khari had been part of Cheliax since long before she was ever born, and though Linxia's parents kept their Garundi surname, they gave her a traditional Chelish first name. Her family long ago abandoned the clan ties that define many Garundi, and while Linxia's grandparents still occasionally spoke Osiriani in private, it was never spoken in her own home, and Linxia never bothered to learn her native tongue. To Linxia, the mighty ruins of the Arch of Aroden that tower above Khari were more a symbol of her heritage than the city's Rahadoumi sandstone architecture.</p> 
                <p>When Linxia was still a child, her parents sent her to an Asmodean convent. Both of Linxia's parents were successful merchants and traders, and though they were not religious, they felt it was important for their eldest child to receive a good education if she were to join the family business. At the convent, Linxia learned the grand history of Cheliax, how House Thrune unified a warring nation with the blessings of Asmodeus, and the necessity of laws based on those of Hell itself to preserve an ordered society.</p> 
                <p>Linxia returned home a teenager, now a loyal Chelish citizen ready to do her part to support the empire. But she was taken aback when she overheard her parents talking with an old family friend about a secret cabal of Garundi gentry who wanted to return Khari to "its rightful home" of Rahadoum. Horrified that her parents were involved in such a treasonous plot, Linxia reasoned that her parents' friend must have lured them into the conspiracy, so she immediately reported them to the city guard, the dottari.</p> 
                <p>That night, two Hellknights of the Order of the Rack—dressed in their characteristic night-black armor and flayed-skin cloaks—came to Linxia's house to arrest her parents for sedition. As her parents were hauled away in chains, loudly proclaiming their innocence and begging the impassive Hellknights to show mercy, Linxia only watched in silence. If her parents were truly innocent, then she trusted the law to exonerate them.</p> 
                <p>Linxia's parents were judged guilty that same night, and the next morning, Linxia went to the city square to witness their sentences: scourged with whips until their backs looked like the exposed musculature of the Hellknights' armor, crucified, and then disemboweled. Through it all, Linxia watched without emotion. She was not happy to see her parents' excruciation, but neither did she feel sadness. Even though she still believed her parents were duped, they had been found guilty of treason and had to be punished. The law had spoken. </p> 
                <p>Three days later, when her parents finally succumbed to their tortures and died, Linxia made a decision: she would become a Hellknight herself. Her parents' crime was not their own—they had been misled by a friend, and paid the price. As a member of the Order of the Rack, however, she could help protect other innocents from such dangerous whispers and prevent them from suffering the same fate. The Hellknights personified the law and order that guarded civilization and prevented it from sliding back into barbarity; people like the "friend" who had deceived her parents were criminals whose actions threatened the very fabric of society.</p> 
                <p>As a symbol of her dedication, Linxia shaved her head and got a tattoo of the Order of the Rack's symbol—a spiked torture wheel—on her forehead, so every time she looked in the mirror she would be reminded of her goal, her purpose, and the terrible consequences of failure. Linxia traveled to Avistan and presented herself at the gates of Citadel Rivad, headquarters of the Order of the Rack, and was accepted into the order as an armiger, a Hellknight squire in training.</p> 
                <p>Linxia devoted herself to her new calling, honing her mind and body for the trials that lay ahead. She had received basic combat training at the Asmodean monastery, but under the tutelage of the Hellknights, she learned to fight in heavy armor, mastered the sword and whip, and learned strategy, tactics, and engineering. When not practicing the arts of war, Linxia obsessively studied in Citadel Rivad's library, memorizing the tenets of the Hellknights' philosophy, the Measure and the Chain. To strengthen her resolve and desensitize herself to pain, Linxia regularly and willingly underwent the Order of the Rack's reckoning, purging herself of weakness and undisciplined thoughts by drinking boiling water until her throat scarred and left her voice a ragged rasp.</p> 
                <p>Before Linxia could become a full Hellknight, however, the Order of the Rack had a test for her loyalty. One of Linxia's brothers had been arrested for attempting to rekindle the spark of rebellion that had been stamped out in Khari with her parents' execution. He had been tried, found guilty, and brought to Citadel Rivad for sentencing. Without hesitation, Linxia drew her sword, and looking straight into her brother's eyes, beheaded him without remorse. Like her parents, Linxia's brother had broken the law. Justice was served.</p> 
                <p>With her training complete, her loyalty and dedication to the law tested and found sufficient, Linxia faced her final task: single combat with a summoned barbazu. All around her, many of her fellow armigers failed in this final trial, slain by the devils' barbed glaives or succumbing to infernal wounds and infections they suffered at the hands of the fiends. But Linxia succeeded, emerging bloodied but triumphant, her studies, training, and most of all, her determination, leading her to victory.</p> 
                <p>When she had recovered from her ordeal, Linxia was accorded the full rank of Hellknight and granted the symbol of her station: a suit of Hellknight plate armor, bearing the same flayed musculature motif as the Hellknights who had arrested and executed her parents. Now Linxia serves as a righteous bastion of law against the chaos of insidious knowledge, corrupt philosophies, and rebellious thought. With her sword, she enforces conformity and justice to preserve a peaceful and ordered society—no matter the cost.</p>

               <p>It's also been a great year for new talent, whether that's the four new authors I learned about through the Open Call program or the 21 other authors (both familiar and new) whose names have appeared on the 31 adventures we've published over the past twelve months. Perhaps most significantly of all, Linda Zayas-Palmer joined the development team, greatly helping us not only give each scenario the development time that it deserves but also providing us additional time to plan out the rest of Season 7 and Season 8.</p>

               <p>That's not to say that we've accomplished quite everything that we had hoped. There are still some sanctioning projects on the back burner, but I look forward to the long flights to and from seeing family to catch up on my <a href="/pathfinder/tales">Pathfinder Tales</a> reading list. I've also packed the last few volumes of the <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/ironGods">Iron Gods Adventure Path</a> to work on those Chronicle sheets.</p> 
               <p>So let's look at what's coming out right before your New Year's celebrations—both of which take us to uncharted territory. In fact, despite neither one being terribly Christmas-y at first glance, both of them promote the virtue of helping someone in need.</p> 
               <p>In <a href="/products/btpy9hgz"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #7-12: The Twisted Circle</em></a> by Jon Cazares, the Pathfinders set out from Katapesh in order to investigate the disappearance of an Osiriani researcher who has spent the last several years studying the Mana Wastes. The trail leads to a tight-knit community south of Alkenstar, where the proud villagers endure and thrive despite the bizarre magical events that sweep through the area. I'm really looking forward to stories about this Tier 1-5 scenario, as it really lends itself well to building atmosphere, fun dialogue, and uncovering one of the spell-scarred region's secrets.</p> 
               <p>We can also look forward to <a href="/products/btpy9hh0"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #7-13: Captive in Crystal</em></a> by Monica Marlowe (RPG Superstar 2015). In this Tier 5-9 adventure, the Society needs a team to track down whatever remains of five Pathfinders who disappeared years ago while using a strange <em>wayfinder</em>. Chief among those missing in action was Sorrina Westyr, the Society's former Master of Spells until a decade ago, when Aram Zey filled the vacancy. I've wondered for a long time who preceded the current three Masters of Scrolls, Spells, and Swords, and I had an opportunity to explore one of them while writing an entry in <a href="/products/btpy99sa"><em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Lost Treasures</em></a>. Now at last we get to follow up on that loose thread and learn what befell Sorrina Westyr and her team. I'll give you one hint in the form of an art preview: an imposing shaitan genie with the kind of muscles that cause Seltyiel to weep with envy and drive Sajan to make a new year's resolution to do more crunches. If you want your Pathfinder Society character to look this cool, take heart! This scenario also revisits one of the boons I've received the most questions about in the past year, and as a special gift to you, you don't need to have it on the same character who plays this adventure.</p> 
               <p>I'd love to share more of the art, but there's some major spoiler material among them; I want to give folks a month or so to play through the adventures before I add it to a blog. After all, 'tis the season for avoiding spoilers, thanks to the new Star Wars movie's release. As of writing this blog, I still haven't seen it, but no doubt that will have changed by the time this goes live.</p> 
               <p>May your 2015 conclude peacefully, safely, and with some great gaming memories!</p>

               <p>Our community shined bright in 2015! <a href="/paizocon">PaizoCon</a> and Gen Con were amazing successes for Paizo, turning out an ever growing number of gamers, and leaving our staff in awe of the wonderful folk out there who support Pathfinder and Paizo. In fact, this year we formed a <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lhdw">dedicated community team</a> just to accommodate you all and plan for future community events, provide online support, and outreach through more outlets than before.</p> 
               <p>This year also meant a lot of new Paizo faces. We've added three new developers (Amanda Hamon Kunz, Crystal Frasier, and Linda Zayas-Palmer) who work on our Adventure Path, Campaign Setting, Pathfinder Society, and other various lines, as well as two new editors (Jason Keeley and Josh Vogt).

               <p itemprop="description">The <a href="/products/btpy9gry">second issue of Pathfinder Hollow Mountain</a> just debuted, bringing along with it an unsettling revelation. As it turns out, Seoni, Valeros, Kyra, Merisiel, and Ezren aren't the only adventurers exploring Thassilon's ruins. Demons and undead, deadly traps and lethal magic fill the ancient halls of Hollow Mountain, but those threats pale in comparison to four of Pathfinder's most unscrupulous iconics: Meligaster, Damiel, Oloch, and—of course, my personal favorite—Seltyiel.</p> 
               <p>In outlining the Hollow Mountain comic series, Erik Mona, James Sutter, and I all had preferences on which issues we wanted to write. Dividing things evenly, we knew we each had two parts to play with. Erik had great ideas for the densest, most dungeony meat of the story, while Sutter wanted the bookends. As for me, I wanted the issues with the bad guys.</p> 
               <p>As you can see from the cover, Hollow Mountain #2 reveals that the iconic heroes aren't alone in the dungeon. Fresh from their faceoff in <a href="/products/btpy9cvj">Pathfinder Origins #3</a>, Seoni and Seltyiel butt heads again, now as leaders as their respective adventuring parties. To his side, Seltyiel's recruited several of Pathfinder's most morally flexible iconic characters, leading them in a quest for gold and glory—but mostly gold.</p> 
               <p>Talking brass stats, though: we've known for a long time that Seltyiel's not a nice dude—past character sheets clearly note his lawful evil alignment. Clearly greed, charm, and great fashion sense go a long way when it comes to being an able member of any adventuring group. Seltyiel's the organizing force behind these rival adventurers, but he doesn't have any illusions about his team's loyalty: they don't work for him, but rather for a promised payday. It's not secret that Seltyiel's my favorite of the iconics, so I'm absolutely loving getting another opportunity to give him a voice—especially the smirking, sarcastic one I always imagine him having.</p> 
               <p>By the same sinister token, Meligaster is chaotic evil. As a manipulator, he's climbing his way to the top on the backs and shoulders of enemies and allies alike. And what his ambition won't win him, his mesmerist powers will. At his heart, I think Meligaster's a coward, but unfortunately for everyone around him he's trained his entire life (and his considerable occult powers) to assure that no one ever finds that out.</p> 
               <p>Damiel's an interesting case, as he's chaotic neutral. He's brilliant, but also arrogant, utterly self-serving, and not interested in making friends. Damiel brings his mastery of alchemy into Hollow Mountain, curious about what ancient insights and strange reagents it might hold. Despite not being evil, though, he might be the most calculating and inhuman (in-elven?) of the explorers. This makes him a fascinating character to write, as what he's feeling never enters into his motivations.</p> 
               <p>Lastly, there's Oloch, another chaotic neutral character. With his battle fervor and devotion to Gorum, though, actual Pathfinder players might find him the most relatable member of Seltyiel's team. He's along for the treasure, sure, but there's also glory and adventure to be had, placing him staunchly on the line between brutal foe and potential ally. We've all had a lot of fun with Oloch, and the Star Trek fans among us have had to be careful not to write him too "Klingon."</p> 
               <p>As the shadows of Seoni and her team, Seltyiel and his troupe are every bit as clever and driven. <a href="/products/btpy9gry">Hollow Mountain #2</a> kicks off the two groups' clash, a rivalry running the rest of the series and that promises to leave our heroes wondering what's worse: an ancient wizard's deathtrap dungeon or other adventurers.</p> 
               <p>If you're like me and always find yourself rooting for the bad guys, you're going to dig the newest, nefarious issue of Hollow Mountain. Pick it up right here at paizo.com or at your favorite place to buy comics!</p>

               <p>Over my years in PFS, no matter where I traveled, I met fantastic artists. Their creations enhanced their tables and brought an added layer of "WOW" to their games. Unfortunately, most of these creations stay in their local areas and unless you're fortunate enough to live close by, you don't get to share in the fun. I intend this contest as way for our global community to share their creations and see what people are up to in other areas of the world.</p> 
               <p>The theme this time is a hand-painted Pathfinder Society mini. Whether a favorite player character or a beloved NPC, as long as it is from the Pathfinder Society and your creation it counts.</p> 
               <p>The prize? Gift certificates to paizo.com! First place will win $25 and three runners up will get $15 each.</p> 
               <p>The crunchy bits for entering:</p> 
               <ul>
                <li>You may only enter once</li>

               </ul> 
               <p>Entries will be accepted until <b>12:00 PM Pacific time on January 11, 2016</b>. Voting will open on January 14, 2016 and continue until February 5.</p> 
               <p>Our global community spans many cultures—no matter when and where your celebration, the Pathfinder Society team wishes you an enjoyable and joyful time. Stay safe and remember to set your calendars forward to 4716!</p>

              <div itemprop="articleBody"> 
               <p itemprop="description">Making <a href="/products/btpy9iln">December's Pathfinder Adventure Path SoundPack</a> for the second chapter of <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/hellsRebels"><em>Hell's Rebels</em></a> has been amazing! Not only because I got to build a complete SoundSet for underwater exploration and combat (so cool, making all my normal sounds wishy washy and strangely muted), not only because I got to build a Xorn, and a Rope Golem (except I can't call either of them by their real names, because OGL), but mainly because I got to work with two of my favourite voice actors again.</p> 
               <p>Morgan Rands, I met at PaizoCon, and this year he donated a series of roars that we chose to be the official Pathfinder <a href="/products/btpy9f04">Green Dragon</a> for the amazing <a href="/products/btpy9f04"><em>Dragon's Demand SoundPack</em></a>. The horror and sheer guttural intensity of what Morgan gave at the microphone cannot be underestimated, so when he offered to give more sounds whenever I needed something I couldn't pass up the offer. Since then Morgan has given all sorts of bits and pieces, including the King Chess Piece voices and the Dice Roller sounds for our brand new shiny <a href="https://catan.syrinscape.com/?paizoblog" target="_blank"><em>Catan SoundSet</em></a> in the Board Game Player. And for <a href="/products/btpy9iln"><em>Turn of the Torrent</em></a> Morgan didn't disappoint! From Barzillai's sneering Proclamations to the slightly disturbing snarls of the three headed cerberi.</p> 
               <p>Morgan Jenkins, I met at PaxAus, and this year I spoke on a Panel he ran about Tabletop Gaming for Visually Impaired people. It was extremely informative and inspiring. Morgan does great things for a not insignificant group of gamers, for example encouraging us at Syrinscape to add interface scaling to our Apps (already done = you can make the buttons bigger) and high contrast backgrounds (in the works now = making the backgrounds black). Morgan has a seemingly endless hoard of voices bouncing round in his head, and for <a href="/products/btpy9iln"><em>Turn of the Torrent</em></a> he gave me a trio of extremely peculiar and quite inebriated NPCs to populate the wonderfully seedy tavern the "Tooth and Nail". These characters (who even sing), will enable GMs to deliver an amusing and genuinely memorable break from slaying and looting in any Pathfinder adventure.</p> 
               <p>It's wonderful having these two great guys on the end of an email. All I have to do is type in, "Right, are you keen to give me a slightly psychopathic, disturbed, but competently deadly human Expert/Fighter/Rogue?" and before I can say, "mixing up the pretty sounds" I've got an inbox full of several thousand bytes of viscous Pathfinder audio gold.</p> <iframe style="width: 560px; height: 315px; display: block; margin: 0 auto;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iWpwHOQBvqQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> 
               <p>So thank you so much Morgans! Since the beginnings of Syrinscape, we have been keen to use community created content and voice acting rather than just standard commercial sample packs. That's one of the reasons I love freesound.org, where I am able to use great recordings made by keen amateurs, and best of all put their names in lights inside our app. One of these days one of my fantastic contributes is going to get a lead role in a feature film after a big producer with an even bigger cigar hears their voice in a Syrinscape Pathfinder SoundSet. That'll be a great day.</p> 
               <p>If you are a <a href="/products/btpy9dhp">Syrinscape Fantasy</a> or <a href="/products/btpy9dhr">SuperSyrin Subscriber</a> you'll see these SoundSets live in the Fantasy Player already as well as stand alone "Seedy Tavern" and "Flooded Dungeon" versions very soon. If you're not a Subscriber you can still hear them by grabbing <a href="https://store.syrinscape.com/subscriptions/trial-supersyrin/?paizoblog" target="_blank">a free 30 day trial sub</a>, which unlocks everything we've ever made.</p> 
               <p>And remember, if you're another Morgan (or Morganette), don't hesitate to get in contact with us to see if you might just have exactly what we are needing in our next Pathfinder Adventure Path SoundPack.</p>

              <p class="date">Saturday, December 19, 2015</p> 
              <div itemprop="articlebody"> 
               <p itemprop="description">The caravan pulled into the campsite. Suso watched from the safety of the wagon while the adults made camp and tended to the animals. The mild winter meant an extended traveling season, but tonight their wandering paused long enough to celebrate the Ritual of Stardust. While most of their celebrations of Desna arose spontaneously, the longest night and the longest day each year held special reverence and rituals for the caravan's patron goddess. The company had stopped two days early to give enough time to prepare for the special night.</p> 
               <p>Suso followed her grandmother throughout the preparations, asking questions even though she already knew the answers. "Grandmama, why do we add raisins to the dough?"</p> 
               <p>"The raisins represent the stars in the sky."</p> 
               <p>"So why do we braid the dough?"</p> 
               <p>"The braid symbolizes our winding path through this life, Suso."</p> 
               <p>Even though it broke the rules of her game, Suso couldn't resist showing off a little. "And you're making a butterfly shape out of the dough to honor Desna!"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, dear, you're correct."</p> 
               <p>"Does that mean I can have one now?"</p> 
               <p>Her grandmother smiled. "Nice try, Suso. They're for tomorrow." She dumped a small mountain of raisins into the girl's outstretched palm, then shooed her toward the door. "These will have to hold you over. Now get!"</p> 
               <p style="text-align: center;">∗ ∗ ∗</p> 
               <p>When dressing for the party, the company pulled out its finest outfits, each of brightly colored flowing materials, allowing free movement of limbs. Suso looked in her basket and chose a skirt dyed in bright blue tones, a vest covered with mirrored discs, and a scarf with tassels to tie about her waist. She swirled and twirled in front of her grandmother. "Grandmama, how do I look? Like a butterfly?"</p> 
               <p>"Very nice, Suso. But it's still missing something." Her grandmother reached into the pouch at her waist—the bag that held so many interesting things—and withdrew a rose quartz crystal suspended from a thong. She placed it around Suso's neck. "I think you're old enough for a proper necklace, don't you?"</p> 
               <p>"Thank you, Grandmama! Thank you!" Suso hugged her grandmother tightly. Face pressed to the old woman's stomach, she asked, "Can I have a starknife too?"</p> 
               <p>Her grandmother laughed, making her stomach bounce. "Not yet, little one. That must wait for another season and another celebration."</p> 
               <p style="text-align: center;">∗ ∗ ∗</p> 
               <p>As the sun set in the sky, the chosen members lit the bonfires they had prepared. Five fires, set on the points of a star, ringed a large open space. Those picked to light the fires took their places. Chosen from all walks of life, they included the company's matriarch, the map-keeper, the lead hunter, the newest baby with his parents, and a visitor from Brevoy who'd been traveling with the company the past few months. They took lit brands and flung them into the waiting stacks of wood. The flames crackled as the final fingers of light retreated from the sky.</p> 
               <div class="blurb360">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderCampaignSetting/PZO9267-DesnaShrine.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderCampaignSetting/PZO9267-DesnaShrine_180.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Suso shivered with excitement. Platters laden with meats, roasted vegetables, and the special butterfly buns passed from hand to hand. Some nights, there might not be enough food, but tonight the entire company would eat its fill.</p> 
               <p>Throughout the feast, people rose in turn to sing, lifting their voices to the stars. Some sang songs in homage to Desna, telling of her association with the swallowtail butterfly, or citing passages from her holy text, The Eight Scrolls. Others told of their travels, painting pictures of hard-to-reach places and distant skies. A few sang of lucky encounters, in which Desna blessed their endeavors. As the piles of food dwindled, people grabbed instruments and accompanied the singers. Suso reached for a drum and pounded a beat, sometimes in time with the song and sometimes counterpoint, whichever struck her fancy. Members of the company started dancing, the firelight reflecting off the bangles of their outfits as they spun and twirled.</p> 
               <p>Several hours of merriment passed, the enthusiasm of the early hours ebbing to relaxation. Children curled up in their parents' arms, exhausted from excitement and the late hour. Determined to remain awake until the end, Suso rose to her feet and started a slow path around the fires. As always, her grandmother tracked her passage with her eyes, watching to make sure Suso didn't tumble into the flames.</p> 
               <p>Some time later, Suso skipped back to her grandmother's side, holding a butterfly roll in her little hands. She held out the desert. "Share with me, Grandmama."</p> 
               <p>Her grandmother reached out and broke off a small portion, "Thank you, my dear."</p> 
               <p>They looked toward the matriarch, who retrieved a pouch from behind her seat and pulled herself to her feet. As the pouch passed from hand to hand, each person removed a small handful of sand from its depths. As one, the company turned to face the fires, a solid circle ringed by the star. Suso quickly popped the last of her roll into her mouth and chewed as she scooped sand from the pouch. Then she took her place between her grandmother and uncle.</p> 
               <p>As the matriarch lifted her voice in invocation, the company threw the sand onto the embers. The sand shimmered as it flew through the air, drifting down upon the coals.</p> 
               <p>In her softest voice, Suso asked, "Grandmama, why does the sand sparkle?"</p> 
               <p>People around the circle smiled. Suso's grandmother leaned down and whispered, "The sand is laced with bits of rose quartz, which catches the light. We use it to symbolize the winking stars in the sky. Through it, Desna witnesses our words spoken here tonight."</p> 
               <p>With one voice, the people of the company began to chant to the starry sky:</p> 
               <blockquote>
                <p><i>Follow the path, follow the stars, wherever your feet may take you.<br> Over the plains, over the hills, through forest and grassy glen.<br> No matter the time, no matter the trail, remember that you are loved.<br> I am with you, She is above, until we're together again.</i></p>
               </blockquote> 
               <p>Families gathered their children, lovers their partners, and together the people of the caravan made their way back to their wagons. Though travel would start again tomorrow, tonight they would sleep and dream, secure in the wings of Desna's blessing.</p>

               <p itemprop="description">Last week, James gave a run down on the path to Pathfinder #100 <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5liav">in this blog</a>. Now I'm here to talk a bit about the contents of this special volume—<a href="/products/btpy9e8f"><em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #100: A Song of Silver</em></a>.</p> 
               <p>First off, since James wrote the adventure for this volume, we needed someone to develop it and I was the man for the job. Normally we don't sub in another developer for an adventure in an Adventure Path in order to maintain continuity, but when the developer running the Adventure Path is the adventure's author it makes it easy for someone to step in. I'm pretty sure James knew the story he wanted to tell, and he was readily on hand for any questions I had.</p> 
               <p>The next cool thing about this volume of Pathfinder—at least for me—was that I had the chance to get the publisher to write an article for me. He's a busy man, but I managed to convince Erik Mona to pen the Aroden article. It's a good thing too. If he didn't agree we wouldn't have run the article, because as Aroden's creator, Erik was the only man for the job.</p> 
               <p>The biggest new addition to this volume is the Friends and Foes section where we present an NPC inspired by every Adventure Path we've done so far—from <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/riseOfTheRunelords"><em>Rise of the Runelords</em></a> to <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/giantslayer"><em>Giantslayer</em></a>. These NPCs provide a GM with a new character to introduce to their campaigns, and the write up gives plenty of suggestions for the NPC's role in other Adventure Paths than the one they are primarily associated with. Best yet, I made sure to get some of your favorite Adventure Path writers to create these NPCs. It was a lot of fun wrangling all these authors to present this special retrospective. Be sure to check out the introduction to see who wrote which character.</p>

               <p>Finally, since James indulged himself and put one of his characters into the adventure, I decided to do something similar and nab half of the bestiary for myself (James did the other two monsters). At this past <a href="/paizocon">PaizoCon</a>, I ran a game that featured a monster that I designed especially for the adventure. I also was on a panel with artist Jason Engle and the art team where we talked about monster design while Jason sketched up a new critter based on the conversation. When we were done with the panel I was shocked by how much what he drew looked like the monster I designed for my adventure, and I knew what I had to do. I talked with Sarah Robinson, and we ended up getting Jason to turn the sketch into final art so that we could use the art for my monster that I suddenly planned to inject into this volume. And that's how the telgrodradt ended up in Pathfinder Adventure Path #100.</p>

Getting to <a href="/products/btpy9grm"><em>Pathfinder #100</em></a> has been a long and fun road, and it's a great accomplishment for any monthly publication. I'm proud to be on the team that gets these books into your hands every month. Here's to the next 100 (and much, much more)!</p>

               <p>Never before have we revealed so many secrets about this Hell-bound nation, from its politics and history to its diverse cities to everyday life under the iron thumb of House Thrune. Among many other things, this gorgeous 64-page book also lays out the stark reality of crime and punishment in Chelish society, as illustrated below.</p>

               <p>If traveling through the infernal empire is more your style—those tines are rather confining, after all—the book also offers an array of magnificent location art and maps, as well as accompanying details. Take this illustration of Khari and the Arch of Aroden, for example.</p>

               <p>Of course, all of these Chelish places would be little more than window dressing if it weren't for the complex folks who inhabit them. The book discusses dozens of individuals who play vital roles in shaping Cheliax and its myriad locations into living, breathing places ripe with intrigue and opportunities for adventure. Below are illustrations of two such individuals, as well as a sneak peek at one of the book's six new monsters!</p>

               <p>This month, we're looking at <a href="/products/btpy9e43"><em>Bloodbound</em></a>, a book that's both harder and easier to write about than any other—because its author is none other than Paizo Editor-in-Chief F. Wesley Schneider!</p> 
               <p itemprop="description">Wes and I have been working together—and writing together—for more than a decade at this point.

               </div> 
               <p>So when we started publishing Pathfinder fiction, I encouraged him to audition. It can be intimidating to try something new under the eyes of your colleagues—just because we work here doesn't give any of us a free pass to a novel, and we're often each other's harshest critics—but Wes persevered. He started out with a web fiction story, <a href="/pathfinder/tales/serial/shatteredSteel">"Shattered Steel."</a> Then he wrote the Pathfinder's Journal <a href="/products/btpy8qgc"><em>Guilty Blood</em></a> (also starring Ailson Kindler) in the <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/carrionCrown"><em>Carrion Crown Adventure Path</em></a>. At that point, I knew without doubt that he could write an amazing novel, and told him as much.</p> 
               <p>I'll let Wes talk about the more than two years that passed between the final outline of <a href="/products/btpy9e43"><em>Bloodbound</em></a> and the completion of its manuscript, but suffice to say, Wes worked <i>extremely</i> hard on this book, and it shows. The dialogue is snappy. The landscape—Ustalav, of course—is lovingly rendered, providing the perfect introduction to the gothic cities and streets Wes has been building for years. The characters are fun and compelling—and not just the protagonists! The book focuses on Larsa (illustrated here), a royal investigator and dhampir, and Jadain, a young priestess of Pharasma, as they track down a deadly rogue vampire. As you might expect, their odd-couple dynamic is fascinating. (After all, Pharasma hates undead, but a dhampir's only <i>part</i> dead... right?) Yet my favorite characters were the side characters—the crotchety former adventurer Ailson Kindler, and the delightfully snarky, foppish vampire Considine. (Seriously, if you like characters like Seltyiel—or Wes himself, for that matter—you're going to <i>love</i> Considine.)</p> 
               <p>So now, many years after we first started talking about it, <a href="/products/btpy9e43"><em>Bloodbound</em></a> is out in the world. I couldn't be prouder of how the book turned out, nor of Wes for writing it (even if it <i>does</i> rob <a href="/products/btpy94r3"><em>The Redemption Engine</em></a> of the coveted "longest Pathfinder novel ever" award).</p> 
               <p>I hope you enjoy the book as much as I did—and if you check it out, please post reviews! Books live or die on the strength of their reviews, and this one deserves a long life (though as Considine shows us, undeath is pretty okay, too).</p>

              <div itemprop="articlebody"> 
               <p>Hello, Pathfinders. Today's blog is a grab bag of PFSACG updates from me and designer Keith Richmond about Season of the Righteous, Season of the Runelords, and more!</p> 
               <h2>Season of the Righteous Story Update</h2> 
               <p itemprop="description">It was a long ride over heaps and hordes of demons (and probably more than a few brave crusaders), but Season of the Righteous is finally coming to its glorious end. Let's recap the story so far with a <i>whole lot of spoilers</i>:</p> 
               <h3><a href="/products/btpy9ewl">Adventure 1-1: Herald's Chosen</a></h3> 
               <p>The Herald of Iomedae, also known as the Hand of the Inheritor, has divined that demons are up to no good. (When are they not?) The Herald chose the best and brightest crusaders available (plus maybe a Darago or two who snuck in). You cleared the fortress city of Kenabres of a gathering horde (herd? stampede?) of fiendish minotaurs, as well as a gaggle of demon-summoning, polymorphing witches. You then cut your way past the Fiendish Tree ruler of Storasta to save Fort Clearwater from demonic invasion—and from itself. By the end of the adventure, you were not only granted mythic power for your deeds, but you were hot on the trail of an obvious trap, and the Herald <i>totally</i> knew how to safely spring it.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZOACGS0101A-Herald.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZOACGS0101A-Herald_180.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <i>Iomedae chose her Herald for his wisdom and good judgment.</i> 
               </div> 
               <h3><a href="/products/btpy9fkd">Adventure 1-2: War for the Worldwound</a></h3> 
               <p>Sound the horns, beat the drums, and let sing the tenors of war! With a Rallying Cry, and over the bodies of a few (or more than a few) demonic mongrels, you gathered a powerful army to your side. You led them fearlessly against armies of cultists, undead, and demons in order to reach Raliscrad. But the Herald's confidence proved to be hubris: he sprung the demons' trap and was somehow spirited away. Even as you did all you could to keep your army alive, the wardstone in Kenabres shattered. You laid waste to armies of evil, but the demonic hordes are seemingly endless. With the loss of Kenabres, the line of wardstones, and the Herald, have you already lost the war?</p> 
               <h3><a href="/products/btpy9g8v">Adventure 1-3: Lexicon of Paradox</a></h3> 
               <p>You got together with the hero-studded cast from Dave Gross's <a href="/products/btpy90py"><em>King of Chaos</em></a> to try and track down the <i>Lexicon of Paradox</i>, an artifact rumored to hold the secret to closing the Worldwound. Dispatching a trio of hags and the sangudaemon Ommors, you made your way to Undarin, stronghold of the Worldwound's creator. Kasiya, a powerful vampire, thwarted your plans to stealthily retrieve the Lexicon, but at Greengrove Keep you thwarted him quite permanently. The succubus Yavalliska used the moment of chaos to seize the power of the Lexicon to become a god, but she was also vanquished, though at horrible cost...</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZOACGS0103E-Oparal.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZOACGS0103E-Oparal_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZOACGS0103E-Radovan.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZOACGS0103E-Radovan_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZOACGS0103E-Jeggare.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZOACGS0103E-Jeggare_180.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <i>If you have a problem, if no one else can help...</i> 
               </div> 
               <h3><a href="/products/btpy9h4s">Adventure 1-4: The Mighty and the Righteous</a></h3> 
               <p>Though your comrades thought you dead, you know that no righteous hero would be kept down by merely being hurled into the Abyss. After a rocky descent, you acclimated to the chaos and horror of the place. It wasn't a pretty picture, but you learned of a way back through the Worldwound. It took a mighty show of force, and you had to play some of the demons off against each other, but you returned to Mendev.</p> 
               <h3><a href="/products/btpy9h4t">Adventure 1-5: Herald's Vengeance</a></h3> 
               <p>It was finally time to get some payback for the kidnapped Herald of Iomedae. You cut a wide swath through the Worldwound and defeated horrors that have plagued the area for centuries, including the Herald's 12-armed kidnapper. You then rushed off to rescue both the Queen and the <i>Lexicon of Paradox</i> from a plague of shadow demons and from Khorramzadeh himself.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-Khorramzadeh.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-Khorramzadeh_180.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <i>Didn't think we'd make you wait until adventure 6 to fight him, did you?</i> 
               </div> 
               <h3><a href="/products/btpy9hw5">Adventure 1-6: The Last Crusade</a></h3> 
               <p>At long last, your quest comes to an end. At the head of an army of crusaders, you smashed your way through to Undarin. Along the way, you completed a number of quests, including joining the Pathfinder Society to free Jormurdun. Areelu Vorlesh was busy performing a ritual to hurl all of Golarion into the Rasping Rifts, so you kicked her out of Undarin. True heroes are rarely content to rest on their laurels, so you went down and punched Deskari in the nose a few times to get his attention.</p> 
               <p>With Deskari defeated and the Worldwound closed, now it's time for a long break. Right?</p> 
               <h3><a href="/products/btpy9ikn">Scenario 1-P: Dread Lord Rising</a></h3> 
               <p>Surprise! It ain't over yet—we've snuck in a special bonus scenario that can only be played by characters that have gained the reward from the Season of the Righteous Adventure Path. This time it's all about you (and whether you get eaten).</p> 
               <p>As you defeated Deskari, he cashed in a favor with his father Pazuzu and set the more powerful demon prince of the air on your trail. After all, Pazuzu is hungry for power and you're positively dripping with the stuff.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZOACGS0100-PE-Pazuzu.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZOACGS0100-PE-Pazuzu_180.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <i>He'd like fries with you.</i> 
               </div> 
               <p>As final proof of your mythic might, your reward is the everlasting favor of Iomedae: access to the mythic paths Sword and Shield of Iomedae. That should spice up any future replays of Season of the Righteous!</p> 
               <h2>Season of the Runelords Launch</h2> 
               <p>Keith, Mike, and Tanis have had a blast crafting Season of the Righteous for you. We just can't stop coming up with delicious ways to take the game we've made and spin it into new stories. There's been a lot of clamoring for a return to our original Base Set, <a href="/products/btpy951a"><em>Rise of the Runelords</em></a>, and we aim to please. Season of the Runelords will debut at <a href="http://wintfan.baldmangames.com" target="_blank">Winter Fantasy</a> in fabulous Fort Wayne, Indiana from February 3-7, 2016.</p> 
               <p>That week, we'll release the first scenario in Adventure 1 of Season of the Runelords, as we've been calling it internally. Winter Fantasy attendees will get the chance to play through all of Adventure 1 and Adventure 2 well in advance of their release dates, so come freeze your toes off with us in February!</p> 
               <h2>One More Thing</h2> 
               <p>Tanis promised "and more" above, so here's a sneak peek at some boons from January's <a href="/products/btpy9e8d">Barbarian Class Deck</a>!</p>

               <p>The Venture-Officer team saw reorganization with the addition of the Regional Venture-Coordinators and Venture-Agents. While I've been posting about the promotions and resignations of Venture-Captains and Venture-Lieutenants, I haven't said much about the others. The Regional Venture-Coordinators' jumped in with both feet and are working hard to get a handle on PFS in their areas and increase communication with the Venture Team. Positives in my book!</p> 
               <div class="blurb180">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PFS-Desk.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PFS-Desk_180.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>So far, I've processed the applications of 66 new Venture-Agents and have another 60ish to process early this week. If the stars align and the winds are right, the 120ish new agents will join the team at the New Year. Their main task involves bringing events to venues near you, spreading the goodness that is PFS. If you know of a venue that could host PFS, but isn't, find <a href="/pathfinderSociety/about/regionalCoordinators">your local Venture Officer on our roster</a> and let them know!</p> 
               <p>Besides the Venture-Officer reorganization, I'm working with the team on another initiative. Charity resides near and dear to my heart. While a Venture-Lieutenant, I co-founded CrispyCon, with Venture-Lieutenant Carol Tierney. All of the profits from CrispyCon went to charity. Over the years, we supported the British Polio Foundation, the Peterborough Neo-Natal Unit, and Sarcoma UK, to name a few. When I left the UK, Carol and Venture-Captain Chris Brockley Blatt morphed CrispyCon into 3XP and continued the charity tradition. This November, they raised £1295 for the Red Cross, SANE, and TOFS. In this spirit of charity, in 2016, we are adding two boons to the rotation. These boons are specifically to aid in raising funds for established charities. There are a few criteria, of course, that the Venture-Officers will confirm before submitting their convention information. If you feel your convention qualifies, contact your local Venture-Officer to participate.</p> 
               <p>Speaking of boons. Currently, most boons reach players hands at conventions. The PFS team discussed the forum posts where players noted they couldn't always attend cons, put our heads together, and came up with a few new programs. The first is a Welcome to the Society boon for new players and is for a person's XXXXX-1 character. We designed the boon with an eye to surviving those first scenarios while learning the ropes. We also added GameDay boons to the mix, designed to bridge the gap between weekly sessions and conventions. Right now, I tasked the Regional Venture-Coordinators to identify GameDays in their regions, so that we can distribute support worldwide. I'll publish more information on the GameDay program in the upcoming weeks.</p> 
               <p>Boons are to the Roleplay Guild as Rewards are to the Adventure Card Guild. I'm working with Tanis on similar benefits for new Card Guildies. Several Convention Rewards exist and will make their way to Conventions and GameDays near you offering Adventure Card Guild play.</p> 
               <p>These aren't the only tasks I've worked on over the past 11 weeks, but I need to keep something up my sleeve for future blogs. One hint—get your paintbrushes and glue guns ready!</p> 
               <p>Until next time—Explore, Report, Cooperate!</p>

               <p itemprop="description">With the January release date for <a href="/products/btpy9er4"><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a> right around the corner and everything entering "pause" territory for the upcoming holiday, I don't have any new figures to show off for this week's <a href="/pathfinderbattles">Pathfinder Battles</a> previews.

(These figures hit the Paizo warehouse too late to go out with December subscription shipments, and will be fulfilled in late-December/January.)</p> 
               <p>WizKids has continued their tradition of providing amazing paint jobs for the entire <a href="/pathfinderbattles/iconicHeroes">Iconic Heroes</a> line, and <a href="/products/btpy9f9q">Set 4</a> is certainly no exception. Below, I've outlined the six figures in the set with "final" photographed images of the actual release figures. Sometimes, zooming in super close on figures like this has a way of highlighting some of a figure's minor blemishes, but overall I think these photos are a good representation of what you get in the box.</p> 
               <p>Let's take a look!</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/IconicHeroes-Crowe.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/IconicHeroes-Crowe_360.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>First we've got Crowe, Human Bloodrager, from the <a href="/products/btpy978v"><em>Pathfinder RPG Advanced Class Guide</em></a>. Crowe puts the "show" in Shoanti. Did you know superstar Pathfinder artist Wayne Reynolds based the look of Crowe on his own Pathfinder character? While I have little doubt that Wayne could produce an absolutely KILLER paint job on a blank Crowe figure, I also have little doubt that there is only Wayne Reynolds, and we can't all be great at art. For the rest of us, <a href="/products/btpy9f9q"><em>Iconic Heroes Set 4</em></a> does all the work, resulting in a beautiful figure.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/IconicHeroes-Lirianne.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/IconicHeroes-Lirianne_360.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Our first crack at Lirianne, Half-Elf Gunslinger, came in the <a href="/products/btpy8xg6"><em>Skull &amp; Shackles</em></a> set. While I adore the attention to detail and fine points of the costuming on that figure, I was never quite satisfied with the way Lirianne's face sort of fell into the overall composition, leading to a somewhat compromised miniature altogether. I'm pleased to report that <a href="/products/btpy9f9q"><em>Iconic Heroes Set 4</em></a> does away with compromise to present a figure that is awesome from top to bottom.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/IconicHeroes-Hakon.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/IconicHeroes-Hakon_360.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Next up is Hakon, most famous for being the iconic skald in the <a href="/products/btpy978v"><em>Advanced Class Guide</em></a>, but more beloved to me personally for being the brother of the greatest Pathfinder RPG character who ever lived, Ostog the Unslain*. Hakon's face tattoos and eye tampos look better in hand than under the unforgiving magnification of digital photography, and overall I'm very pleased with how he turned out. He works great for any kind of axe-wielding warrior, and I can see this piece getting a lot of use at my table fighting with or against the player characters.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/IconicHeroes-Jirelle.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/IconicHeroes-Jirelle_360.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>By my eyes, this figure turned out the best in the entire set. Here we have Jirelle, Half-Elf Swashbuckler, again from the <a href="/products/btpy978v"><em>Advanced Class Guide</em></a>. Jirelle has a remarkably complex costume, so I've always been a little concerned with how the final figure would turn out. I needn't have worried. She looks fantastic.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/IconicHeroes-Shardra.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/IconicHeroes-Shardra_360.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Although the straight-on angle of this photo makes it difficult to see, my favorite thing about the Shardra, Dwarf Shaman figure is its three-dimensionality. I think this is the best dwarf we've created for Pathfinder Battles so far, and the morningstar/censer combination makes her great for any kind of ceremonial dwarf—a race that always stands on ceremony.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/IconicHeroes-Kolo.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/IconicHeroes-Kolo_360.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Shardra would feel quite lonely without her spirit animal Kolo, a rambunctious rock lizard. Perfect for use as a familiar, animal companion, or even just a random lizard in a subterranean encounter, Kolo has a message on its little scroll that says: Beware! I kick ass.</p> 
               <p>And that's it for <a href="/products/btpy9f9q"><em>Iconic Heroes Set 4</em></a>! I'll be back next week with one more preview for 2015, and after that, we'll all have visions of brand new minis dancing in our heads!</p> 
               <p>Until then, I remain,</p>

               <p>Time flies when you're on a deadline every single month.</p> 
               <p itemprop="description">It surely doesn't feel like 100 months have passed since <a href="/products/btpy7zkr">"Burnt Offerings,"</a> the first volume of the <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath">Pathfinder Adventure Path</a>, showed up on my desk. A lot has changed for me in those 100 months—I've moved my place of residence, my job's moved ITS place of residence, I've lost more than 150 pounds, I've gained countless new friends and industry contacts, and more.

I couldn't be prouder of how this volume turned out... or more nervous, frankly. I hope folks like the adventure!</p> 
               <p>It was as early as <em>Wrath of the Righteous</em> that Erik Mona started putting the 100 Bug in my head, of course. At that time, it was still years in the future, but it was pretty obvious that, barring cataclysmic apocalypse-related events, we WERE going to make it to that stage. "What should we do for volume 100?" became an increasingly pressing question. The answer was more complicated than one might initially think, since the way math works meant that volume 100 of Pathfinder Adventure Path wouldn't coincide nicely with any other significant event—it wasn't going to be the first or last volume of an Adventure Path, nor would it sync up with any other notable Paizo-related anniversaries. It was, in fact, smack in the middle of an Adventure Path, and that raised some challenges.</p> 
               <p>The end result, of course, is now out for folks to see. <a href="/products/btpy9grm">Pathfinder Adventure Path #100</a> is 32 pages longer than any other volume of the Adventure Path. It's the first one to contain a foldout poster (presenting an awesome depiction of the first 102 volumes of the Adventure Path along with a minis-scale map of an encounter area that plays a key role three times in the campaign—twice in this adventure!). It's the first one where we've spent more than half a page discussing one of the setting's most talked-about and mysterious characters—the dead god Aroden. (And no, we still don't tell you HOW he died.)</p> 
               <p>And of course, I fully admit to certain self-indulgences I made along the way. What's the point of being Creative Director if you can't claim volume 100's adventure as one you write? Or if you can't put one of your favorite characters in the adventure? Of course, I went even beyond that—I wrote the adventure, one of the commemorative NPCs, and two of the monsters (Adam will be around later to talk more about that half of the book and more). And I didn't just put one of my favorite characters in the adventure—I put her on the cover.</p> 
               <p>Anyway, enough about that! There's a lot more going on in <a href="/products/btpy9grm">"A Song of Silver"</a> than my pet NPCs—so go grab your copy and check it out! Or if you don't have a copy handy yet... then check out some of the incredible art from volume 100 below!</p>

            <p itemprop="description">I remember that I sent a really disturbing nursery rhyme to my players a few days before the first <em>House on Hook Street</em> sessions, and that it was sometime around 2007. A few weeks previously, our group had one of those typical post-game "the thrill-is-gone/I've-seen-it-all/memorized-the-bestiary/bought-the-tshirt" laments that we've all felt at some point, and I recall another player boldly challenged me for something truly fresh and surprising, but using existing materials.

               </div> 
               <p>I recently got a chance to develop an adventure written by my good friend Brandon Hodge. It also turns out I got to develop an updated version of an adventure that Brandon ran for our group nearly 10 years ago.</p> 
               <p>Brandon has a solid background as a scholar of the esoteric and occult, and after he was brought on as a consultant for <a href="/products/btpy9egu"><em>Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures</em></a>, we knew that he'd be the best fit for an adventure that would tie in to that book. After running the idea past him, he immediately had an idea for the adventure pitch—one he knew well from years back. Since I've been friends with Brandon since high school and since I'd been a player in that adventure, it made me the best choice to develop it... and that adventure is <a href="/products/btpy9grs"><em>Pathfinder Module: The House on Hook Street</em></a>.</p> 
               <p>Of course, the adventure has changed from when I was with my home group back in Texas, and I think it's even better. I'll let Brandon get a few words in about the history and process.</p> 
               <blockquote> 
                <p itemprop="description">I remember that I sent a really disturbing nursery rhyme to my players a few days before the first <em>House on Hook Street</em> sessions, and that it was sometime around 2007. A few weeks previously, our group had one of those typical post-game "the thrill-is-gone/I've-seen-it-all/memorized-the-bestiary/bought-the-tshirt" laments that we've all felt at some point, and I recall another player boldly challenged me for something truly fresh and surprising, but using existing materials. So, I picked up the gauntlet.</p> 
                <p>And that's how <em>The House on Hook Street</em> was born. The original adventure predated the Pathfinder RPG by a couple of years, but it was still set in Golarion, though in the recently debuted streets of Riddleport rather than Old Korvosa. Back then, my longtime pal Adam Daigle and I were just enthusiastic players in a couple of weekly games in Austin, and Daigle was just beginning to sniff around the industry, and trying to drag me along with him. With his encouragement, I wrote this new adventure in the <em>Dungeon Magazine</em> format with the intention that maybe—just maybe—I'd get it published.</p> 
                <p>And because the re-write shifted the original plot enough that it isn't spoiler material anymore, the mechanic I used to 'file off the serial numbers' of monsters involved a bloodthirsty thieves' guild using tainted potions, with transmogrifying results that let me use some of my favorite creatures in new and horrifying ways, keeping my players guessing at every turn even as I was peering menacingly from the other side of an open <em>Monster Manual</em>. It was part of the challenge, after all, and I just went wild: thieves who "overdosed" on tainted <i>elixirs of hiding</i> essentially used the stats for shadows but dragged their discarded corpses behind them, while tainted <i>potions of gaseous form</i> let other thieves exhale their souls as weird belker-things. Just don't ask me about the poor sap that overdosed on a tainted <i>potion of tongues</i>—it's way, way worse than you think, and, yes, the horrifying legacy of that encounter made its way into the final product. See if you can spot it!</p> 
                <p>My players went crazy trying to figure out what was happening, and I loved the results enough to keep the adventure in my back pocket. When <em>Occult Adventures</em> came along and Erik asked me to write an adventure using those materials, I knew I finally had the perfect tools to bring the greater story to life. And by shifting the setting to Korvosa, I got to revisit some of my favorite material from my friend Nick Logue and the <em>Curse of the Crimson Throne Adventure Path</em>, and I think you'll appreciate the results!</p> 
                <p>I recently ran the rewritten adventure again as a playtest, with two members of that old group getting to revisit <em>The House on Hook Street</em>. Sadly, Daigle couldn't join us, and just had to deal with my constant updates and pictures of the action, some of which I've included here. I'm happy to say my players were blown away with the adventure's latest incarnation, and just as surprised with the twists and turns as their first time through. That, and there's about 50 hours of gameplay packed in between these covers, so I think you're getting your money's worth.</p>

                <p>So, it'll be yours now. You'll get to revisit Old Korvosa and witness its transformation yourselves, and I know you'll have as much fun with it as we did. And how cool is it that after all of our years of friendship, that I get to work right alongside Daigle as my developer on an adventure he actually played in nearly a decade ago, before we even got into the biz? Pretty damned cool, if you ask me!</p>

               <p>One of the things I remember from that adventure long ago, aside from being creeped out by Brandon's description of his reskinned antagonists, was getting frustrated with getting to an enemy and just hacking through the floor. (I think something might have even been on fire.) One of the things that I'll remember about <i>this</i> adventure is getting to work on cool and creepy material from Brandon while he sent me the aforementioned "constant updates and pictures of the action." I swear I got at least one email or text per page of adventure during the process.</p>

               <p>It was fun setting this in Korvosa, as it was a great way to show that occult elements are always lurking in the shadows, waiting for intrepid adventurers to peel back the layers and discover the esoteric bits hiding beneath. Pick up <a href="/products/btpy9grs"><em>The House on Hook Street</em></a>, gather your friends for adventure, and let us know how it went!</p>

               <blockquote> 
                <h2>Chapter One: Deserving Victims<br> <i>Larsa</i></h2> 
                <p>Both were victims.</p> 
                <p>She ground against him, forcing hips away from the soot-smeared stone of the alley wall, hands grasping, mouth gnawing.</p> 
                <p>His breath came as a gasp but left as a growl. Hands struggled with her dress's collar. Hairy fingers dug in her skin.</p> 
                <p>Had I been a passerby, glimpsing them sidelong from the street, I might have been envious. Even knowing what they were, some voyeuristic urge stopped me on the slick shingle overlook. The appeal of hard and soft flesh aside, I wondered which of the pair was more the monster.</p> 
                <p>Clothes fell away, hardly barriers at all, the straps of her provocatively innocent dress following his tailored coat. Peasant cloth dangled from her waist, skin milky in the alley's slats of mist-webbed moonlight. He barely spared a hungry glance before diving back to her kisses, a coarse hand pinning her shoulder to the bare brick. Her own light touch played him like the moist rim of a wine glass, the results just as audible.</p> 
                <p>I couldn't hear their words, but the timbre of their murmurs gave away a predictable script. Gravelly whispers threatened pleasures. Feigned naivete filled her response with blushes. His hand slipped behind him, reaching for the grips of the tool jammed in the back of his belt, no longer hidden under his big coat. The steel of workman's shears scored the gloom—shears that had, in preceding weeks, pruned at least four similar alley flowers. Her&nbsp;slitted eyes didn't see, her head falling back under an assault of bruising kisses. The blades came up.</p> 
                <p>Here it was.</p> 
                <p>Like a whip crack, the motion was too fast even to blur. With a snip and splash the shears clattered to the boggy cobbles.</p> 
                <p>There was no pleasure in his second gasp. </p> 
                <p>Pale arms that had strained to enfold him a moment earlier now bit into his skin like viciously pulled reins. Her kiss on his neck was deeper now, sharper and hungrier. He struggled, but only now, with jaws at his neck, did he realize that he wasn't the predator.</p> 
                <p>A shame. I'd hoped she'd be the one surprised. Few humans could match her experience, though—she'd likely been hunting in the city for decades. She might have continued, too, if she played by the rules. Now she'd become a problem.</p> 
                <p>My problem.</p> 
                <p>I dropped from my vantage. Heavy with the night's cold mist, my cloak slapped the stained cobbles. Her eyes were on me even as her mouth worked her lover's neck. Greedy thing, she was more chewing than drinking—obviously not of the sort of stock anyone taught manners. I straightened and pulled my sword, its silvered length catching a glimmer of moonlight through the dull haze.</p> 
                <p>Her eyes locked on mine, watching but obviously not considering me enough of a threat to risk losing her meal. The struggling in her grip was weakening, the man gradually accepting a warm, lethargic futility—the best part. I closed cautiously.</p> 
                <p>She came up, as if for the air she didn't need, gasping lewdly as she did. Sweat and blood trailed from her mouth in ribbons. She'd been sloppy, blood coursing down her jaw and chest. Daintily, she touched her hand to her lips, stained fangs glistening behind her fingers. A practiced pout poured over the shoulder of her current beau. "You can be next."</p> 
                <p>Very sloppy. My blade leapt up, obviously faster than she'd expected. A slender white digit arced into the air and plunked into the mud. It didn't bleed.</p> 
                <p>Her scream was not that of a blushing maid. Shrill with shock, it cracked, reaching a pitch like a shrieking hawk. Her lover barreled into me, thrown backward as she extracted herself from his embrace. I spun out of the way, surprised to hear him grunt as the muddy cobbles met his face.</p> 
                <p>My sword came back up for the milkmaid. The alley was empty. My eyes went higher, and so did a missile from my belt. The dart sounded like a wasp for the instant it flew, jabbing its silver stinger into a blood-drenched neck. She'd leapt up one of the alley's crumbling tenement walls—an elementary trick.</p> 
                <p>"Bitch!" Pain growled through the word. She sprang. I slid back. Even with a belly full of blood she was likely faster than I, but I was still quicker than she thought. Nails like claws sliced past my face, digging into filthy alley stone. It wasn't a jarring miss, though—she landed like a bounding cougar and pounced again.</p> 
                <p>My sword was between us, its hilt wrapped with the copper chain of an angelic ankh—the holy icon of Sarenrae, goddess of the sun. She skidded and reeled, expecting the symbol to flare with divine light. </p> 
                <p>"You are forbidden to hunt in this part of the city." I brandished the talisman as though I had faith in it. "Explain yourself."</p> 
                <p>"I have refined tastes." Even stained and exposed, she postured. "I hunt where I choose."</p> 
                <p>"You hunt where your master allows. You hunt where his truce isn't threatened."</p> 
                <p>She tittered, again raising a coy hand to her mouth. It came back wet. "I have no master."</p> 
                <p>"Your arrogance threatens more than you understand."</p> 
                <p>"You mean we threaten you mortals." She started to circle me. "Had that old coward not betrayed his kind with his truce, the only humans in this city would be mindless casks, waiting to be drained."</p> 
                <p>"Overestimation is a disease of the lowborn."</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">

                </div> 
                <p>She sneered. "Your end could have been pleasant, had you the sense not to insult your betters."</p> 
                <p> It was my turn to laugh. "You had to trick a human into an alley. He wasn't under your control—he was planning to kill you. Was his mind too difficult to overpower? Or perhaps your will was too weak?"</p> 
                <p>Her eyes smoldered in the gloom. "How dare—" </p> 
                <p>"Speaking of control, not even a rat has come to your aid. Where are your minions, mistress?" I produced a match and ran my nail across its head, the crisp white flame dramatically lighting her snarl. She was ready to pounce.</p> 
                <p>"But most pitiful," I dropped the match into the muck between us, "is that." </p> 
                <p>On the ground between us lay her dainty, mud-stained digit. </p> 
                <p>"There's no magic in this blade, Your Ladyship. So apparently you're still mortal enough to be cut up by our weapons." I leveled the sword at her face. "You're not my better. You're hardly even fit to call yourself vampire. You're just some bored immortal's stray spawn."</p> 
                <p>Baring her fangs and screeching, she rushed me, crushing the match underfoot. </p> 
                <p>She wanted me dead. Good. There'd be no tricks now. She might not be a true vampire—at least, not as the full-bloods would consider it—but she was still deadly enough.</p> 
                <p>She lashed out wildly, claws blurring. I kept ahead of her, scoring several nicks across her forearms. The bloodless wounds knitted shut with unnatural speed, but her reckless rush gave me plenty of opportunities to make more. </p> 
                <p>Her chirping laugh echoed off the alley walls as I gave ground. A stroke across her stomach killed the noise, the gash deep enough to make her gush blood that wasn't her own. With a sound more gurgle than growl, she grabbed the blade as it freed itself from her midsection. The silver bit deep into her grasp. I thrust to impale her, but the sword didn't budge. Death lent her unnatural strength, and she yanked the blade from my hands. It clattered down the alleyway, toward her forgotten meal. My emptied hands snapped up, one covering my heart, the other reflexively trying to hold her off as she came. She slammed into me, pinning me against the wall just as her lover had trapped her moments before. </p> 
                <p>She locked her nails around my neck. "Scream!"</p> 
                <p>The chill of her hands caused my breath to catch. Death, palpable and endless, washed over me, an arctic wave seeking to erode my soul. While blood kept vampires fed, the chill of their lifeless essence leeched mortal life, freezing a living spirit to death.</p> 
                <p>Fortunately, I liked the cold.</p> 
                <p>"What?" She blinked, baffled as to why her touch wasn't sapping my life. I flashed her a smile, and in that last moment she understood. </p> 
                <p>I twisted, pulling a hawthorn stake from my bandolier, then lunged. The sharpened wood drove home, her weak, wet skin splitting like a reptile egg. A rigidity more appropriate to the deceased seized her body, freezing her face in a look of wide-eyed realization. </p> 
                <p> I pushed, and black locks trailed her stiff fall. She struck the stone with hardly a thud. The stake quivered, but stayed firmly planted through her heart.</p> 
                <p>She wasn't dead—or, rather, she wasn't destroyed. The stake would hold her paralyzed and unaware so long as it remained in place. A final destruction required a bit more effort.</p> 
                <p>At the other end of the alley, I was surprised to find the big man weakly struggling to pull himself against a wall, blood oozing between thick fingers clasped to his neck. I paid his groans no mind and retrieved my blade. </p> 
                <p>Back with my quarry, I performed the necessary field dressing—removing her head. It was a practiced grotesquery, and I hacked through the cold meat with a butcher's half attention. A trickle of gore—none of it her own—reminded me why I hated doing this right after the creature had fed. Finishing the work, I dragged the decapitated corpse to the alley's eastern mouth, propping it against a wall sure to be hit by the morning sun. The dawn would reduce the vampire's body to ashes, assuring no second resurrection.</p> 
                <p>A whimper drew my attention back to the bleeding man. Dropping the vampire's head into the stained sack I used for exactly that purpose, I turned back to the would-be murderer. </p> 
                <p>Past him, a carriage soundlessly pulled up at the far end of the alley.</p> 
                <p>I didn't hold back any of the curses that leapt to mind.</p> 
                <p>Stiff black clothes held a stiff-backed driver, a human in his late fifties who regarded the bodies and incriminating stains with disinterest.</p> 
                <p>"He's expecting you," he said in his perpetually bored voice. Despite the formality, I knew it was an order.</p> 
                <p>Damn. This was sure to further ruin an already perfectly unpleasant night. "I'm almost done."</p> 
                <p>The driver's expression didn't so much as twitch, yet I could tell he disapproved.</p> 
                <p>To hell with him.</p> 
                <p>I retrieved the bleeding man's heavy shears and knelt at his side. He couldn't resist me pulling his hand away, uncovering his torn neck. The spawn had been brutal, but he'd survive.</p> 
                <p>He let me scrutinize the wound closer, obviously mistaking my intentions. He hardly whimpered when my mouth clapped over the deepest wounds, fangs tearing the tortured flesh back open. I pressed his arm against the wall and drank fast, draining him like I was throwing down a shot. I didn't like sharing from the same flask as my quarry, but if the evening was taking the turn I feared, I wouldn't have another chance.</p> 
                <p>Anyway, he deserved it.</p>

               </div> 
               <p>We've mentioned all three of these characters in previous blogs, but now I've got a chance to go into a little more detail. Our design goal for this deck was to make three characters that play differently but can each use the full range of cards in the set effectively. So even characters that aren't, say, Pack Lords can make good use of Animal allies.</p> 
               <p>When the design team thinks of druids, we think of three main features: animal companions, wild shape abilities, and nature spells. So we designed each druid to showcase a different one of these features. As Paul mentioned last week, Class Deck Lini is all about the Animal trait. So we made her some new friends!</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6810-GiantWeasel.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6810-GiantWeasel_120.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6810-Stag.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6810-Stag_120.jpeg"></a>

               <p>Gronk, as you might infer from his art, is a master of shapeshifting. He's in tune with the flora and fauna of the forest, and can alter his form to serve the situation. In testing, he proved quite self-sufficient, and I think he'll be a popular choice.</p>

                <br> <i>Everyone loves the Swiss Army elf.</i> 
               </div> 
               <p>Maznar is the classic “nature's wrath” druid, wielding elemental magic to zap his enemies and succor his friends. I love his art—it immediately told me what sort of character he'd be. Maznar is a follower of the Green Faith, a natural spiritual tradition that abhors abominations and reveres wild things and places. Acolytes of this faith wander the world as a sort of magical park ranger, keeping things as they should be.</p>

               <p>Evil is insidious, it's not always the person stabbing you in the face repeatedly, but instead, it's the person whispering honeyed words into your ears. You've all been victim to it. I've seen you lot, swayed by the <a href="http://paizo.com/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5li3n">promises of the occult</a> or <a href="http://paizo.com/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5li4f">tales of black markets</a>. The crafter of those words was quite skilled. It's my understanding that her hand helped guide the words that fill the tome of which I am to speak.</p> 
               <p>What am I here to discuss? I'm here to talk about evil. Specifically, I'm here to talk about <a href="/products/btpy9he0"><em>Pathfinder Player Companion: Agents of Evil</em></a>.</p> 
               <p>The noblest of soul, or the most depraved mind, can willingly walk the path of service to an evil power. It's important to note that such bondage does not inherently turn one into a force for evil. In this guide, you'll read about bad beginnings, sad stories, and monstrous motivations.</p> 
               <p itemprop="description">For those of you without a maligned past or similarly dark ambitions, there are evil patrons aplenty—from the Aspis Consortium to the Whispering Way—who willingly seek agents to do their bidding.

               <p>All can benefit from the knowledge on fighting the supposed 'forces of good'. Learn strategies to employ against agathions, angels, archons, and azatas alike—most certainly useful for those battling the <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinder/adventurePath/hellsVengeance">rising rabble of the Glorious Reclamation</a>.</p> 
               <p>Contained within the intricate script of this tome are poisons of the foulest sort, with additional necrotoxins—whose sort you've likely learned of from Golarion's black markets. Even the more misunderstood races can learn some skill in service to evil powers, from fetchling magi clouding the vision of their enemies, to tiefling alchemists brewing bombs of pure hellfire.</p> 
               <p>Ah... it appears I may be telling you too much, and our time is growing short.</p> 
               <p>Luckily, there's far too many magic items and spells to adequately describe in this place. I could discuss the withershot muskets, crafted by the servants of the daemonic harbinger Cixyron. Or perhaps you'd like to hear of the Aspis Consortium's success with the aboleth-designed ioun spite bracers.</p>

               <p>Interested?</p> 
               <p>Well, I suppose I could tantalize you with the necromantic spell blood tentacles that does... well, it does exactly what you might expect.</p> 
               <p>Sadly, there's just too much to talk about in a place such as this.</p> 
               <p>Except... Well, I wouldn't be properly evil without mentioning one last seductive item from this volume of inequity. The insinuator is an antipaladin archetype that purely embodies a path of pure self-interest. These paragons of self shun bonding with a single deity, instead living an existence bartering with any power that seems likely to grant them the power needed to meet their own goals.</p> 
               <p>Now I must go. But before I do, I must thank Crystal Frasier and Owen K.C. Stephens for the opportunity to work on this book. If anything, I am truly an agent of their far-reaching evil.</p>

               <p>In this moment, between the month of thanks and the month of celebration, I wish to do a bit of both. Our volunteers are the backbone of Pathfinder Society and without the hours they put into preparing games, organizing venues, coordinating tables, and leading their communities, PFS wouldn't exist. I only listed a few of the ways they help, and I appreciate all the effort expended on our mutual hobby.</p> 
               <p>With a heavy heart, I say goodbye to those that left the volunteer crew. The hours you spent spreading the love are greatly appreciated. So I raise a glass and offer a toast – Cheers to you and best wishes on your next endeavors.</p> 
               <p>But hellos accompany goodbyes. So I would introduce to you the new members of the Venture-Officer crew. Some names are familiar, as they accepted promotion from Venture-Lieutenant to Venture-Captain. Others are new to the team. Welcome and thank you for stepping up to lead PFS in your area.</p>

               <p>Besides the new officers, there are a few others that I would like to recognize this month. GMs take many hours out of their schedule, preparing to run tables. Some like to make fancy terrain, paint special miniatures of non-player characters and monsters, laminate handouts, and other additions that are not necessary, but do highlight their tables. To achieve 5-star ranking as a GM, they put in over 750 hours of game time to run 150 games, as well as all the prep time. They tackled special events, such as the interactive specials. It is my pleasure to introduce you to our newest 5-star GMs:</p>

                <li>Eric Bennett</li> 
                <li>Daniel Luckett</li>

                <li>Andrew Hollingshead</li> 
                <li>Liam Fisher</li> 
                <li>Jesse Riggs</li> 
                <li>Chad Newman</li> 
                <li>Zachary Hall</li>

                <li>Guy Martelle</li>
               </ul> 
               <p>The awesomeness of our volunteers humbles me, as without their commitment to the campaign there would be no Pathfinder Society. Again, to all the volunteers, thank you for your effort and commitment to our great Society!</p> 
               <p>I know there are several conventions going on between now and the end of the year (and we just finished up three others). If you're in the US, choices include Gaymer X, Geekonomicon, MoatCon, Georgia PFS Weekend, and a 48-hour Charity Marathon. Outside the US, there is DAU, Kena Con!, MacquarieCon, KRD Game Days, and the Swiss End of the Year Con.</p>

               <p>It's been a long road to get here—over eight years ago, Paizo released <a href="/products/btpy7zkr">"Burnt Offerings"</a>, the first part of the <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/riseOfTheRunelords">Rise of the Runelords Adventure Path</a>. Roughly 9,504 pages later, here we are at the super-sized 100th volume in <a href="/products/btpy9grm">"A Song of Silver,"</a> with 132 pages of content for your perusal and gaming pleasure. In addition to the 10th-level adventure penned by Creative Director James Jacobs, new monsters, and the Pathfinder Journal by Stephanie Lorée, we've added extra content for this volume. Publisher Erik Mona opens up and tells of the faith of the god Aroden, whose death over one hundred years ago caused catastrophe after catastrophe in the Inner Sea (and beyond). Each of the previoius <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/">Adventure Paths</a> have one of their NPCs detailed and given further background, such as Garavel from <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/legacyOfFire">Legacy of Fire</a>!</p>

Lone Wolf Development and Paizo have teamed up to establish a new digital standard by delivering Pathfinder content through <a href="http://getrealmworks.com" target="_blank">Realm Works</a>, the ENnie award-winning campaign suite.</p> 
               <p>This new partnership will make the entire Pathfinder portfolio available through the upcoming Realm Works Content Market. Pathfinder Adventure Paths, Modules, Campaign Setting volumes, Player Companions, and rulebooks alike can soon be used in ways GMs have only dreamed of. The Content Market will debut in early 2016 with some of your favorite Pathfinder Adventure Paths and Modules, after which we'll begin introducing rules and setting material.</p> 
               <h2>So Why Should You Care?</h2> 
               <p>What sets Realm Works apart from PDFs, Wikis, and other options? Consider just a few ways Realm Works takes digital content to a whole new level:</p> 
               <ul>
                <li><b>Make It Yours</b>—formerly static, published content is now fully customizable, so there's no need for stickies or maintaining separate notes</li> 
                <li><b>Integrates with Your World</b>—seamlessly weave published content into your own campaign, with everything in one convenient place</li> 
                <li><b>Instantly Find Anything</b>—readily explore your realm through extensive links and relationships, full-text searching, and tag-based filtering</li> 
                <li><b>Navigate with Maps</b>—simply click on map pins to view the details of a location, or quickly navigate to the map containing a specific place</li> 
                <li><b>Ready to Share with Players</b>—no more extracting pictures from a PDF, masking out portions of maps, or repeating details multiple times while players take copious notes; reveal details with a few mouse clicks during the game and even let players access material in-between sessions</li> 
                <li><b>Know What's Known</b>—track what information the players have (and haven't) learned with ease, including explored map regions</li> 
                <li><b>Organized for GMs</b>—efficiently access everything needed to run an adventure; Realm Works does all the heavy lifting, converting a traditional module to content that can be readily used at the table</li> 
                <li><b>Instant Session Recaps</b>—review a complete rundown of what the players learned in previous sessions</li>
               </ul>

               <p itemprop="description">I've stood by as my fellow designers on the <a href="/pathfinder/adventureCardGame">Pathfinder Adventure Card Game</a> have spoken their pieces on which character they believe to be the best ever and I've held my tongue.

I needed to wait until all the pieces were in place, all the correct products produced and available to the fans... all the evidence available, so I could show definitively and without fear of serious rebuttal that the best character ever is Lini.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6001-Lini-Token-Front.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6001-Lini-Token-Front_180.jpeg"></a> 
               </div> 
               <p>Lini is the O.G. Best Character Ever. She was my go-to character during the original playtests of the <a href="/pathfinder/adventureCardGame">Pathfinder Adventure Card Game</a>, and she quickly earned a reputation as "pushing the power envelope." It wasn't so much that any single power she had was too broken, but she became an engine that made the game easier for everyone. That engine is largely preserved in her <em>Rise of the Runelords</em> form.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6001-Lini-Front.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6001-Lini-Front_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6001-Lini-Back.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6001-Lini-Back_180.jpeg"></a> 
               </div> 
               <p>The key component of her awesomeness isn't her powers (amazing though they are). It's the fact that she has 6 spell slots in her deck. There are very few characters with that many spell slots, and almost none of them are divine casters. This gives Lini the ability to fill her deck with Healing spells, which not only keep her and her companions alive, but more importantly recycle the cards in Lini's discard pile—including the healing spells themselves! She has a nearly infinite engine for playing her cards over and over again.</p> 
               <p>Her powers have great synergy with this engine. She doesn't have to use her spell slots for attacks because she can simply discard a card to get a base d10 on combat checks. She can also add 1d4 to <em>any</em> of her checks by revealing an ally that has the Animal trait. This essentially gives her that bonus to every check she makes, as long as she doesn't discard or otherwise lose her ally.</p> 
               <p>Her roles build on this rock-solid foundation. Shapeshifter increases her ability to deal with monsters, and Wild Warden makes her more likely to recharge all of those Cures she's going to cast.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6001-Lini-Shapeshifter.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6001-Lini-Shapeshifter_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6001-Lini-WildWarden.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6001-Lini-WildWarden_180.jpeg"></a> 
               </div> 
               <p>I'm not really sure why you'd need more evidence than that to declare her the best character ever, but just for fun, let's take a look at her <em>Skull and Shackles</em> incarnation. This version pushes her toward using her Animal allies instead of revealing them by letting you put them on top of her deck, and increases her combat die from a d10 to a d12. The Feral Druid lets her reveal a Divine card to attack, and the Aquamancer lets her put Attack spells back on top of her deck instead of recharging them. It's a veritable forest of powers and directions to take the character!</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6011-Lini-Aquamancer.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6011-Lini-Aquamancer_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6011-Lini-FeralDruid.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6011-Lini-FeralDruid_180.jpeg"></a> 
               </div> 
               <p>The newest entry in Lini's powerhouse portfolio is from the upcoming <a href="/products/btpy9dyj"><em>Druid Class Deck</em></a>. Once again, she gets to reveal Animal allies for an effect, but in this case she sends them out to attack! This power gives her a minimum of 1d10+1d6+3 on a combat check, and it's easy to increase with feats. The Pack Lord role can increase this attack by another 2d6, and gives her the power to acquire any animal allies her friends might miss. The real jewel in this new Lini's crown, however, is the Menhir Savant, which is unique among all of the characters we've ever made. This new role gives her huge advantages for hanging out at closed locations, including healing all other characters each turn!</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6810-Lini-Front.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6810-Lini-Front_180.jpeg"></a>

               </div> 
               <p>As you can see, there are many different viable choices you can make when you decide to play Lini. She can focus on turning into huge animals, casting attack spells, or (my personal favorite) creating an unstoppable healing engine. Lini doesn't have any bad choices, and this makes her the Best. Character. Ever.</p> 
               <p>Until then, I remain,</p>
