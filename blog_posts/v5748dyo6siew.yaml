  \ Sayre here to give you your next peek into the Remaster project with a look at\
  \ the updated ranger, appearing in <em><a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02eoj?Pathfinder-Player-Core\"\

  \ A red headed dwarf holding an axe in each hand \"></a> \n      <p style=\"font-size:\
  \ 13px;\"></p> \n     </div> \n     <p>The ranger is a wilderness warrior, a character\
  \ who’s good with weapons, good with animals, good in the wilds, and who can sprinkle\
  \ just a little bit of magic into their repertoire if they feel like it. By and\
  \ large, this is one of the classes that most people consider to be solid and effective,\
  \ good at its role both thematically and mechanically. While we’re not inclined\
  \ to fix things that aren’t broken, the ranger being a generally solid and effective\
  \ class pre-Remaster didn’t mean we didn’t have some notable opportunities to go\
  \ in and spruce a few things up, improving the general progression and experience.\
  \ I’ll be talking about a few of those things here.</p> \n     <p>The magical element\
  \ of the ranger is often one of its more understated aspects, but it’s one people\
  \ really care about. Originally, ranger focus spells, called warden spells, were\
  \ added to the class after the fact in the <em>Advanced Player’s Guide</em>, and\
  \ one of the downsides to this was that since they weren’t built into the class\
  \ originally, the class didn’t have mechanisms in place to ensure that the ranger’\
  s spellcasting proficiency improved as the character leveled up. In the Remaster,\
  \ we’ve baked the spellcasting progression directly into the ranger’s core chassis,\
  \ ensuring that class features like Ranger Expertise and Masterful Hunter naturally\
  \ progress the ranger’s spellcasting proficiency all the way up to master. We also\
  \ streamlined the feats that the ranger uses to accrue their warden spells and recategorized\
  \ the spells into easily referenced groups; the 1st-level Initiate Warden feat allows\
  \ you to choose from any of the initial warden spells (which are all of the ranger’\
  s focus spells that start at 1st rank), and there are regularly paced feats all\
  \ the way up to the 10th-level Peerless Warden feat that gives you access to the\
  \ strongest ranger focus spells available, which are focus spells that all start\
  \ at 5th rank.</p> \n     <p>Along with the general improvements to spellcasting,\
  \ we also added some new feats to help make certain builds pop and shine a bit more\
  \ brightly. Precision rangers who like combining warden spells with big shots from\
  \ crossbows will likely appreciate the Warden’s Reload feat shown below, which allows\
  \ them to reload as a free action once per round when they cast a warden spell;\
  \ this combines nicely with staple spells like <em>gravity weapon</em> to increase\
  \ your weapon damage or spells like <em>ranger’s bramble</em> that damage and immobilize\
  \ your foes, making them easy targets for you to pick off from a safe distance!</p>\

  ></p> \n     </div> \n     <p>Ranger snares are going to be the one thing not appearing\
  \ in <em>Player Core</em> that were originally available to the class; snares were\
  \ kind of the least satisfying of the options available to the ranger and the least\
  \ used options, so we’ve pulled those out of the class. They’ll be appearing in\
  \ <em>Player Core 2</em> alongside the Snarecrafter archetype, with a much-needed\
  \ facelift.</p> \n     <p>There were also a few places where we had feats that many\
  \ people saw as being taxes that you had to pay to accomplish a specific flavor.\
  \ For example, the Crossbow Ace feat that originally appeared in the <em>Pathfinder\
  \ Core Rulebook</em> was written under the assumption that all crossbows were simple\
  \ weapons, and so it provided a damage bonus that essentially converted those simple\
  \ weapons into martial weapons whenever you took certain actions like using Hunt\
  \ Prey or reloading. This ended up having a couple issues. On the one hand, the\
  \ damage bonus was big enough that the feat felt like a “must have” if you were\
  \ going to be using a crossbow, crowding out build versatility and other options.\
  \ On the other hand, the feat was actively fighting with the ranger’s play loop;\
  \ if you were Tracking your prey before combat began and you had your crossbow in\
  \ hand loaded and ready for the fight, you didn’t have any way to get your damage\
  \ bonus! Playing the character the way that everything in the game was telling you\
  \ to play your character was leading to situations where you couldn’t use the abilities\
  \ you were supposed to be using in the situations you were supposed to be using\
  \ them. </p> \n     <p>To address those issues, we added a martial crossbow, the\
  \ arbalest, so that you could expect a more reasonable damage output without needing\
  \ to pay a feat tax. While we had the patient open on crossbows, we also adjusted\
  \ them to make them their own weapon group, with a damage-oriented critical specialization\
  \ that deals 1d8 persistent bleed damage plus additional bleed damage equal to the\
  \ weapon’s item bonus to attack rolls. If you preferred the bow critical specialization\
  \ they had before, you can add that back onto your crossbow with the <em>grievous</em>\
  \ rune, which makes it so that getting a critical hit with your crossbow when you\
  \ have the critical specialization adds the bleed damage and also pins the target\
  \ to an adjacent surface until they Interact to pull the bolt free.</p> \n     <div\

  \ \n     </div> \n     <p>With the basic damage outlay on crossbows addressed via\
  \ the core weapon system, we were able to make reloading more fun and tactical with\
  \ the feat space that was opened up. In addition to options like the Warden’s Reload\
  \ feat I mentioned previously, we’ve also reworked Crossbow Ace and similar options\
  \ to function more like the gunslinger’s various reload abilities, giving you additional\
  \ things you can do to reinforce your playstyle with reload weapons while improving\
  \ your ability to achieve the kind of cinematic tactical maneuvering that the class\
  \ was always aiming to provide.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\
