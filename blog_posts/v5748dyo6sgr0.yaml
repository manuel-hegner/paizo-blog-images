  \ Roleplaying Game is set to launch on August 1st, and in anticipation, we thought\
  \ it was time to take a look at the game and give you a sense of what you can expect\
  \ from the new version of the rules! Starting with this blog and continuing every\
  \ week until release, we are going to be looking at different aspects of the game,\
  \ from a broad overview to some of the finer details of character generation and\
  \ adventure design. Taken together, these blogs should give you a head-start on\
  \ learning the game and bringing it to your table!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ by Setiawan Lie</p>\n     </div> \n     <h2>What is Pathfinder all about?</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>At its heart, Pathfinder Second Edition is the same type of game as\
  \ first edition. You take on the role of a sword &amp; sorcery adventurer of your\
  \ own design, going on daring adventures for a chance at fame and fortune. One player\
  \ takes on the role of Game Master, helping to adjudicate the actions of player\
  \ characters, nonplayer characters, and monsters, weaving all of them together to\
  \ form a compelling story—one that everyone at the table helped to create!</p> \n\
  \     <p> Of course, as a game, Pathfinder is a lot more than just telling stories.\
  \ It is a system of rules that defines how the world works, and for Second Edition\
  \ we wanted to make sure that this game “engine” was easy to understand and interpret,\
  \ both for players and Game Masters! And while we made sure that creating and advancing\
  \ your character was a clean and intuitive as it could be, we also ensured that\
  \ the game allowed your choices—your vision for your character—to truly matter.\
  \ The decisions you make in Pathfinder define your character, expressed not just\
  \ in the story but in the rules as well. </p> \n     <h2>Core Mechanic</h2> \n \
  \    <p>Pathfinder is a narrative roleplaying game, meaning that you describe what\
  \ your character is attempting to do while the Game Master describes how the story\
  \ and world unfolds around you. Whenever there is doubt or uncertainty in actions,\
  \ you will be called upon to make a check, which requires you to roll a d20 and\
  \ add a modifier based on your character’s proficiency at that particular challenge.\
  \ These checks come in many forms, from swinging a sword to climbing a cliff to\
  \ dodging a roaring fireball. The result of your check, as interpreted by the GM,\
  \ determines whether or not you succeed at your task, and might even decide whether\
  \ or not your character survives!</p> \n     <p>In Pathfinder Second Edition, proficiency\
  \ determines nearly every important statistic used by your character during play.\
  \ How skilled are you with a longbow? How good are you at Stealth? What is your\
  \ aptitude for casting illusion magic? All of these statistics, and many more, are\
  \ defined by your proficiency in the statistic. </p> \n     <p>Proficiency is gained\
  \ through the choices you make in building your character. If you are untrained,\
  \ you get no bonus at all, but you can still add a modifier from a relevant ability\
  \ score to represent your raw talent. If you are trained, you add your level plus\
  \ 2, along with any other relevant modifiers. If you are an expert, you add 4 instead.\
  \ Masters add 6, and characters with legendary proficiency add 8. This basic formula\
  \ applies to nearly everything in Pathfinder Second Edition, making it easy for\
  \ you to see where you stand and understand what your chances are at overcoming\
  \ the challenges the game puts in front of you. </p> \n     <h2>Facing Danger</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>The world of Pathfinder is a dangerous place. Vampires lurk in forgotten\
  \ tombs, trolls prowl in the mountains, and deadly dragons await atop mounds of\
  \ priceless treasure. These threats—and many more—await your character as they explore\
  \ the story, and more often than not, such encounters will end with a thrilling\
  \ combat.</p> \n     <p>Combat in Pathfinder is much more structured than the freeform\
  \ narrative play of the rest of the game. During combat, participants take turns,\
  \ during which the number of things that can be accomplished is limited. On your\
  \ turn, your character will get to take three actions. Many of these will be what\
  \ are called basic actions, like moving, drawing a weapon, opening a door, or making\
  \ an attack. Some might be special actions that only your character can take, based\
  \ on the choices you made during character creation. Casting spells, performing\
  \ amazing martial stunts, or utilizing special class features like rage are all\
  \ examples of special actions.</p> \n     <p>Just because your turn is over does\
  \ not mean that you do not have an opportunity to participate in the combat. Some\
  \ characters can take special reactions that allow them to interrupt the flow of\
  \ play on other characters’ turns. You might dodge an incoming attack, block with\
  \ your shield, or even attempt to counter an enemy’s spell. Each character can only\
  \ take one reaction between turns though, so you have to make it count!</p> \n \
  \    <p>Combat continues until one side is defeated, gives up, or retreats, but\
  \ these deadly encounters are just one way that you might resolve conflict. You\
  \ might use skills or magic to sneak past foes, or you could try to talk your way\
  \ out of a fight, relying on guile and charm to win the day. Ultimately, the way\
  \ you approach danger in Pathfinder is up to you, and your chance at success depends\
  \ on the choices you make for your character! </p> <!-- yes this is a table. please\

  \ \n     <p>Pathfinder Second Edition empowers you to tell your own story, no matter\
  \ what side of the table you occupy. Players have a wide variety of choices in making\
  \ their character, giving them the tools to bring their idea to life. Your choice\
  \ of ancestry, background, and class define the major parts of your character, but\
  \ they are just the beginning. Your choice of skills, feats, and gear say a lot\
  \ about the player character you are portraying and as you gain power, the new choices\
  \ you get to make speak to your hero’s journey. You can come up with a plan for\
  \ your character’s growth, or you can let their adventures influence your decisions.\
  \ It’s up to you!</p> \n     <p>Taking on the role of Game Master brings a whole\
  \ different kind of flexibility to your role at the table. As GM, you get to shape\
  \ the overall narrative, defining the actions of villains, monsters, and all of\
  \ the nonplayer characters that make up the world. You provide the adversaries that\
  \ the PCs must face if they hope to succeed, and your narrative forms the backdrop\
  \ that allows the characters to grow and triumph. Pathfinder provides a wide range\
  \ of tools to help you in this vital task, from guidelines on how to build balanced\
  \ encounters to narrative advice, and guidance on how to create a welcoming play\
  \ environment. Within the pages of the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01zp3?Pathfinder-Core-Rulebook\"\
  >Core Rulebook</a> you will also find a wealth of treasure to award to your PCs\
  \ when they succeed and a bunch of devious traps to guard the treasure. Most importantly,\
  \ the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01zp4?Pathfinder-Bestiary\">Bestiary</a>\
  \ contains over 400 monsters waiting to face off against your PCs, from shambling\
  \ undead to fiendish demons.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190624-1.jpg\"\

  \ \n     <p>In the coming weeks, we are going to be looking at various aspects of\
  \ Pathfinder Second Edition to give you a better idea about how each part of the\
  \ game works. Next week, we are going to go over the steps you take when making\
  \ and leveling up a character, but make sure to come back every week as we take\
  \ a deep look at the new combat system, explore creating your own adventures, and\
  \ provide a bunch of tips and tricks for using Pathfinder to tell your stories!</p>\
