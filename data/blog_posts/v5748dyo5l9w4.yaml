  \ \n    <p class=\"date\">Thursday, December 11, 2008</p> \n    <p>Before I get\
  \ into the new open call format as well as the next round of open calls, I want\
  \ to talk about the submissions for Pathfinder Society Scenarios #19 &amp; 20. I\
  \ received nearly as many submissions for 19 &amp; 20 as I did for 17 &amp; 18,\
  \ but the difference this time was that I received almost all of them for 19: <i>Skeleton\
  \ Moon</i>. The other scenario, 20: <i>Demon Haunts the Devil's Hall</i>, received\
  \ an incredibly low number of submissions, and after looking through them again\
  \ and again none of the submissions wowed me sufficiently to select the submitter\
  \ as the author. I then spent some time thinking about our submissions process and\
  \ I think our process may be to blame for the reduction in submissions for 20. I\
  \ asked for 20 to include a non-SRD monster (the nabasu) that many submitters probably\
  \ weren't familiar with and I asked for no undead (because we've been undead heavy\
  \ lately) in a scenario where the monster (again, the nabasu) could potentially\
  \ create undead with one of its powers. These two errors on our part, I believe,\
  \ led to a serious reduction in submissions and because the pool was so small, there\
  \ weren't a lot to choose from. In the end, I had to choose none of them. Instead,\
  \ we've removed <i>Devil's Hall</i> from the schedule, to appear later in season\
  \ 1, and replaced it with a later scenario I'd planned to assign rather than open.\
  \ So for the 19 &amp; 20 round, I'll select an author for 19 only and the new 20\
  \ will be written by an existing freelancer.</p> \n    <p>That brings us to the\
  \ open call round for 21 &amp; 22. I'm going to test a more open format for both,\
  \ though I'm still going to suggest a few key items on each—items that are necessary\
  \ either for art resources or simply to keep game play spread around the Inner Sea\
  \ region. These restrictions will be relatively minor and shouldn't hamper creativity\
  \ overmuch. I am, however, opening this test with a few caveats:</p> \n    <p>1.\
  \ Don't break our world. If you submit something that breaks part of our world,\
  \ it'll be auto-rejected. The scenarios are one-shot, 4-hour adventures—epic story\
  \ arcs, world-shattering events, wars, mass famine, etc. don't have a place in them.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>2. Understand Pathfinder Society Organized Play before you submit. Specifically,\
  \ understand that the Pathfinder Society is an organization of vagabond scholars,\
  \ thrill-seeking treasure hunters, and extreme explorers. They are not necessarily\
  \ the \"good guys,\" they don't get \"hired\" for their adventures, and they're\
  \ not generally looking to make the world a better place. Submitting generic 3.5\
  \ \"save the day\" adventure ideas will decrease your chances of getting to write\
  \ one. There are plenty of resources out there to give you a feel for the Society:\
  \ the <a href=\"http://paizo.com/pathfinderSociety/scenarios/v5748btpy84k4\">Guide\
  \ to Pathfinder Society Organized Play</a>, <a href=\"http://paizo.com/pathfinder/adventurePath/riseOfTheRunelords/v5748btpy7zkr\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder</i> #1</a>, and the <a href=\"http://paizo.com/store/downloads/pathfinder/pathfinderChronicles/v5748btpy84eo\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Chronicles Campaign Setting</i></a> all have information on the Pathfinder\
  \ Society. </p> \n    <p>3. I need to feel that you've read or played a few scenarios\
  \ before submitting. I'll get this sense through your proposal—our scenarios have\
  \ a very specific flow to them and your outline should follow this flow. Read one\
  \ or two before submitting.</p> \n    <p>4. Pathfinder Society scenarios must be\
  \ no more offensive than PG-13. Scenarios are played in public at public settings\
  \ and children will be playing them. As an aside, the number of submissions that\
  \ involve violence toward children is staggering—no more of those, please.</p> \n\
  \    <p>5. This is not a contest. This is more like an interview for a job—you're\
  \ showing me your best idea and I'm deciding if the combination of idea and writing\
  \ skill equals you being selected as our next scenario author. I need authors—not\
  \ winners.</p> \n    <p>6. Finally, I just don't have time to return every submission\
  \ with feedback. I did that with the first round, for 17 &amp; 18, and it stretched\
  \ my resources and time very thin. </p> \n    <p>Rules for submitting Pathfinder\
  \ Society scenario outlines are as follows:</p> \n    <p>1. Based on the guidelines\
  \ for the current round, write a 750-word outline that includes the following:</p>\
  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>a. A title—the more evocative the better</p> \n \
  \    <p>b. A brief introduction that acts as a prologue for the scenario</p> \n\
  \     <p>c. A brief summary of how the PCs proceed through each encounter</p> \n\
  \     <p>d. A brief summary of each encounter—minimum five encounters</p> \n   \
  \  <p>e. A brief conclusion—what happens if the PCs fail or succeed</p> \n     <p>f.\
  \ You <b>no longer</b> need to submit mission ideas with your outline</p> \n   \
  \ </blockquote> \n    <p>2. By the due date, email your outline to <a href=\"mailto:josh@paizo.com?subject=SCENARIO%20NAME_YOURLASTNAME\"\
  >josh@paizo.com</a> with the subject line <b>SCENARIO NAME_YOURLASTNAME</b>. Your\
  \ summary must be in a MS Word document, Notepad, or Real Text format—these are\
  \ files ending in <b>.doc</b>, <b>.txt</b>, or <b>.rtf</b>. Your file must be titled\
  \ SCENARIO NAME_LAST NAME, i.e., PerilsofthePiratePact_Dayon.</p> \n    <p>3. Include\
  \ your full legal name, email address, physical mailing address, and a contact phone\
  \ number at the top of your submission—this text does <i>not</i> count toward your\
  \ word count. </p> \n    <p>4. Please allow 72 hours for a response before resending\
  \ your submission. </p> \n    <p>The current open call is for Pathfinder Society\
  \ Scenarios #21 &amp; 22—the May releases. The full schedule for this submission\
  \ period is as follows:</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>• 12/11/08—Open call begins</p>\
  \ \n     <p>• 12/19/08—Submissions due by 11:59 p.m. Pacific Time</p> \n     <p>•\
  \ 1/9/09—Submissions review completed—selections and rejections notified</p> \n\
  \    </blockquote> \n    <p><b>Guidelines</b></p> \n    <p>**<b>SPOILER ALERT: Do\
  \ not read the guidelines below if you wish to avoid spoilers for upcoming scenarios.</b>**</p>\
  \ \n    <p><b>Pathfinder Society Scenario #21</b><br> Suggested Title: <i>The Eternal\
  \ Obelisk</i><br> Setting: Qadira<br> Monster: A medusa<br> Level Range: Tier 5–\
  9; tiers 5–7 and 8–9</p> \n    <p><b>Pathfinder Society Scenario #22</b><br> Suggested\
  \ Title: None<br> Setting: Rural Cheliax<br> Monster: Open<br> Level Range: Tier\
  \ 7–11; tiers 7–8 and 10–11</p> \n    <p>PLEASE NOTE: Pathfinder Society Scenarios\
  \ are written with a 4-hour time limit in mind. Your outline should reflect 4 hours\
  \ of solid game play.</p> \n    <p>Joshua J. Frost <br>Events Manager</p> \n   </blockquote>\
