                <p itemprop="description">When we first started brainstorming the three new ancestries we intended to put into the <i>Lost Omens Character Guide</i>, leshies weren’t even on the list. We knew we didn’t want to overlap with the ancestries that are going to show up in the recently announced <i>Advanced Player’s Guide</i>, but that still left us with far too many contenders for the mere three ancestry slots we had available.

As we debated, Mark Seifter came in with a message from himself and the rest of the Design Team: “What about leshies?”</p> 
                <p>Well, what <i>about</i> leshies?</p> 
                <p>Much like their introduction into Pathfinder 1E, leshies gained incredible traction in a short amount of time, and they managed to cinch the last, coveted spot as an early ancestry for Pathfinder 2E. We know leshies aren’t for everyone, but we recognized their presence was an opportunity to emphasize some of the truly unique aspects of the Age of Lost Omens as a setting. While many ancestries have unique and challenging viewpoints by the standards of humanity, leshies are separated from both flesh and mortality as we understand it.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/083019_LeafLeshy.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com//image/content/Blog/083019_LeafLeshy_360.jpeg" alt="A tall, graceful humanoid composed of tree branches and leaves cradles a huge seed pod in its hands."></a> 
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">Illustration by Ksenia Kozhevnikova</p> 
                </div> 
                <p>Leshies are a combination of the physical and the supernatural. The true heart of a leshy is a nature spirit, but these spirits don’t have bodies and can't easily affect the material world on their own. It’s only when a master of primal magic creates a suitable vessel for a spirit, and a spirit accepts that vessel as a body, that a leshy is born. Once a leshy is created, they could theoretically live forever—though the dangers of Golarion mean this rarely occurs—and leshy souls don’t go to the Boneyard upon death like those of mortals. Instead, destroying a leshy simply frees their primal spirit back into nature; that spirit could even be summoned into another leshy body at some point in the future. Reincarnated leshies tend to put most of their memories of their past lives aside, but that doesn’t mean they forget everything, and a newborn leshy might choose to pursue a particularly treasured friend or important cause from a previous existence. </p> 
                <p>Like hobgoblins, leshies are an Uncommon ancestry. In the case of leshies, this is because many leshies don’t travel beyond their homes, instead staying to protect and tend to the natural places they sprung from and treasure. I often envision leshies to be something akin to the kodama from the film <i>Princess Mononoke</i>, or other strange creatures from Miyazaki movies—regular townsfolk aren’t going to stab such a mystical forest spirit on sight, but it would still be very strange to see one come into a shop and ask to buy some rope! Big changes have come to Golarion of late, however, and that means more and more leshies are starting to venture out from their forests and caverns, shyly investigating the cities and towns of other peoples as they set forth to hold back a spreading darkness. </p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/083019_GourdLeshy.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/083019_GourdLeshy_360.jpeg" alt="A humanoid with tree-branch limbs, a mantle of leaves and flowers across its shoulders, and a decoratively carved gourd in place of its head."></a> 
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">Illustration by Ksenia Kozhevnikova</p> 
                </div> 
                <p>Leshies get 8 Hit Points from their ancestry, are Small, and have a speed of 25 feet. A leshy speaks Common and Sylvan, plus any additional languages they might pick up. Leshies lack vulnerable organs and veins, giving them an ability boost to Constitution, and have the tranquility and experience of an immortal nature spirit, getting another ability boost in Wisdom. They also get one free ability boost to put in any score. Leshies don’t cling to old memories and can be a little empty-headed—in the case of gourd leshies, literally! —so they get an ability flaw to Intelligence. In addition, leshies don’t eat like most PCs do, instead gaining sustenance from the sun or from rotting matter (though leshies have discovered a way to create bottled nutrients for themselves if they find themselves needing such a precaution).</p> 
                <p>Leshies can also do fun and unusual things with their crafted plant bodies, such as the ability granted by the following ancestry feat:</p> 
                <div style="border:2px solid #5d0104; margin: 1em 0"> 
                 <table style="font-weight: bold;" cellspacing="0">

                    <td style="background-color: #5d0104; color: #fff; padding:0.25rem">SEEDPOD</td>
                    <td style="background-color: #5d0104; color: #fff; padding:0.25rem">FEAT 1</td>

                   </tr>
                  </tbody>
                 </table> 
                 <p style="padding:0.5rem; margin:0">Your body produces a nearly endless supply of hard seedpods. You gain a seedpod ranged unarmed attack that deals 1d4 bludgeoning damage; these Strikes have the manipulate trait. On a critical hit, a seedpod bursts, issuing forth a tangle of vegetation that imposes a –10‐foot circumstance penalty on the target’s Speed for 1 round. Seedpods do not add critical specialization effects.</p> 
                </div> 
                <p>The leshy ancestry entry also suggests some common Core Rulebook backgrounds appropriate for leshies. Nomad or scout might be unsurprising rules and roleplaying recommendations, but be sure to also check out specific backgrounds from the Lost Omens World Guide for other appropriate options such as the Wildwood Local background!</p>

               <blockquote> 
                <p>Keith here to kick off the first in a long series of blogs discussing the new versions of the iconic characters that we did in Core. When designing these characters, we did things in roughly this order:</p> 
                <ol> 
                 <li>Delve into the character’s current backstory.</li> 
                 <li>Evaluate the character’s capabilities in the RPG.</li> 
                 <li>Examine the character’s new art.</li> 
                 <li>Examine every old version of the character to cherry-pick the best parts (using designer definitions of best).</li> 
                 <li>Focus on powers and capabilities that would feel good in any and every adventure we make from here on out.</li> 
                 <li>Make sure the final result feels different enough in play from the previous versions that veterans aren’t bored.</li> 
                </ol> 
                <p>Some things changed with Pathfinder’s new edition, like Valeros using a shield, Harsk dual-wielding axes, Fumbus... existing. Little things like that.</p>

                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">For when you really need to play <i>all</i> the blessings on your check.</p> 
                </div> 
                <p>Hawkmoon, an invaluable contributor on of our forums, <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo5lhzh?Hawkmoons-Best-Character-Ever-Sajan">once wrote all about how Rise of the Runelords Sajan was the best character ever</a>. One of my goals for the new Sajan was making sure he felt different, but still passed “the Hawkmoon test.” Thankfully, Hawkmoon was excited for the changes and liked the new Sajan.</p>

                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">I think CD Sajan stole all of RotR Sajan’s weapons.</p> 
                </div> 
                <p>With Monk Class Deck Sajan, we switched away from the multiple blessings and punching to focus on his use of slashing weapons, particularly that temple sword he’s often holding. This version was dubbed <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo5li0f?I-Do-Not-Seek-Answers-But-Rather-to">Stabby Sajan</a>. We also bumped Sajan to a starting hand size of 5, which is a huge quality of life improvement for a class that’s supposed to feel agile.</p>

                </div> 
                <p>I’ve played a number of monks in the RPG, and one aspect that I felt we could focus more on is how versatile and well-rounded monks are in the RPGs. Or, at least, try to be. They are great at all saves, have a fair number of useful skills, and really like having a good Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, and Wisdom. Monks are pretty much the example class for Multiple Ability Dependence, where you need more abilities than you can afford to increase. Core tries to emphasize the monk’s versatility in a few ways by giving Sajan a more human monk-like array of “okay but not great” stats, and by letting you be “pretty good” (though not great) at more things by recharging your blessings on any check and having more skills. </p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/082319_WeaponStarknife.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/082319_WeaponStarknife_360.jpeg" alt="Starknife, Weapon 0: Knife, Melee, Ranged, Piercing, Finesse."></a> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/082319_WeaponDogslicer.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/082319_WeaponDogslicer_360.jpeg" alt="Dogslicer, Weapon 0: Sword, Melee, Slashing, Finesse."></a> 
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">Punch, kick, slash, stab. Sajan’s no one-trick pony. Four tricks, maybe.</p> 
                </div> 
                <p>Core Sajan keeps a couple weapons in his deck, because he’s got a sword and dagger prominent in his artwork. Thankfully, Core includes some more weapons that use Acrobatics, and knives in Core can be used to help others.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/082319_SajanBlessingCalistria.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/082319_SajanBlessingCalistria_360.jpeg" alt="Calistria's Sting, Blessing 1, Deity: Calistria, Divine, Veteran."></a> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/082319_SajanBlessingGrandmother.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com//image/content/Blog/082319_SajanBlessingGrandmother_360.jpeg" alt="Grandmother Nightmare, Blessing 3, Deity: Lamashtu, Divine."></a> 
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">Sajan doesn’t need to worship a deity to make good use of their blessings.</p> 
                </div> 
                <p>Another benefit that Sajan derives from Core that isn’t obvious at face value is that Core has so many more diverse blessings. As a character who likely blesses every turn, with blessings as his primary card type, this lets you really customize Sajan’s deck in an interesting way. Want to be ready to avenge? Pack a Calistria’s Sting. Want extra dice against monsters, and you’re okay fighting the occasional summon? Grandmother Nightmare has your back. Nothing to worry about there.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/082319_BlessingBigSky.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/082319_BlessingBigSky_360.jpeg" alt="The Big Sky, Blessing 1, Suit: Hammers, Harrow, Veteran. WHEN THIS IS THE HOUR: At the start of your turn, you may remove 1 of your scourges."></a> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/082319_BlessingSickness.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/082319_BlessingSickness_360.jpeg" alt="The Sickness, Blessing 1, Suit: Shields, Harrow, Veteran. WHEN THIS IS THE HOUR: When you suffer damage, suffer the scourge Plagued."></a> 
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">Challenge: have Sajan play all 54 Harrows at least once in one adventure path.</p> 
                </div> 
                <p>Curse’s Harrow blessings open up an entire world of character capabilities for Sajan. Cycling The Big Sky lets you deal with scourges. The Sickness is a good blessing to save for slightly riskier rolls, when you need to make checks a little easier. </p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/082319_SajanRoleExiled.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/082319_SajanRoleExiled_360.jpeg" alt="Sajan, Role 0, Exiled Padaprajna: The goddess Suyuddha teaches anyone who will listen, whether by word or fist."></a> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/082319_SajanRoleIroran.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/082319_SajanRoleIroran_360.jpeg" alt="Sajan, Role 0, Iroran Dedicant: Knowing yourself means first knowing everything else."></a> 
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">Wonder how often Sajan’s roles are mispronounced?</p> 
                </div> 
                <p>Both roles offer a reroll option, since you’re probably rolling a bunch of dice at most things, but you don’t necessarily have a great bonus. Padaprajnas master all aspects of warfare, so that role offers better skill and proficiency with weapons alongside improved teamwork feats. Iroran Dedicant focuses more on perfection of self, improving his unarmed fighting skills and giving him ways to turn any roll into success. Iroran Dedicant also offers a unique ability (not for everyone) to shift around your skill and card feats as you play, letting you adapt to different adventures and correct past choices you might regret.</p> 
                <p>And that’s our new Sajan. In testing, we found him more flexible and interesting to play and advance. Hopefully, you’re enjoying him too!</p>

                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190827-starstonecathedral.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190827-starstonecathedral_500.jpeg" alt="The ivory spires of Absalom's iconic Starstone Cathedral soar into the sky."></a> 
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">Illustration by Mirco Paganessi</p> 
                </div> 
                <p>Our first stop is at Absalom, home of the Starstone Cathedral and a little group known as the Pathfinder Society. Among the various tools of the trade for Pathfinders are their iconic <i>wayfinders</i>. Before the formulaic <i>wayfinders</i> of the modern day became commonplace, the Society created each <i>wayfinder</i> individually and some of these older <i>wayfinders</i> are still found here and there. Along with the <i>archaic wayfinder</i>, visitors to Absalom may take one of the backgrounds available, like the Pathfinder Hopeful background, and the Pathfinder agent archetype! </p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190827-archaicwayfinder.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190827-archaicwayfinder_500.png" alt="Archaic Wayfinder, Item 2. Uncommon, Evocation, Magical. An archaic wayfinder functions as a compass and acts as a repository for one cangtrip cast into it."></a> 
                </div> 
                <p>From Absalom, we head to the northeastern reaches of Avistan and arrive in the Broken Lands. The area is known for the countless independent states of the River Kingdoms, the fractured politics of Brevoy, the mystifying technology of Numeria, the glory of Razmiran, the blighted Sarkoris Scar region, and the crusaders of Mendev who now have a chance to rest with a closed Worldwound. Characters from the Broken Lands might take the Sarkorian Reclaimer background if they wish to reclaim the Sarkorian homeland from the demons that wander there or even learn the storied and ancient tradition of the Aldori swordlords by taking the Aldori duelist archetype. Of course, how can you be a swordlord without the Aldori dueling sword?</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190827-aldoriduelingsword.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190827-aldoriduelingsword_500.png" alt="Aldori Dueling Sword, Item 1. Uncommon, Finesse, Versatile(P). An Aldori dueling sword is a slim, single-bladed dueling sword with a slight curve and a sharp, reinforced point."></a> 
                </div> 
                <p>Next, let’s head southeast to the Eye of Dread, a land marked by recent devastation and war. The rise of the Whispering Tyrant and his armies meant bad news for the Hold of Belkzen, Lastwall, and Ustalav, while the rise of the Ironfang Legion caused disruptions among Molthune and Nirmathas, culminating in the founding of the hobgoblin nation of Oprak. While characters from the Broken Lands might choose to take the fight to ol’ Tar-Baphon by taking the Lastwall sentry archetype, you might be more inclined to play a hobgoblin from Oprak (using the hobgoblin ancestry from the upcoming <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01zt4?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Character-Guide">Lost Omens Character Guide</a>). For you hobgoblin players out there, consider taking the Onyx Trader background.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190827-onyxtrader.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190827-onyxtrader_500.png" alt="Onyx Trader, Background. Oprak doesn't share the secrets of the Onyx Vault with many, but you are one of the lucky few to be permitted into the heart of the nation."></a> 
                </div> 
                <p>Now we head further south to the wonders of the Golden Road. This is land full of cosmopolitan cities with bustling marketplaces and ancient ruins holding lost secrets and treasures. From the countless tombs of Osirion, to the Night Stalls of Katapesh, to the miraculous sun orchid elixir of Thuvia, to the great caravan cities of Qadira, or the mechanical innovations of Rahadoum, there is adventure to be found.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190827-merab.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190827-merab_500.jpeg" alt="A tree-lined walk leads to the ornate front entryway of an elaborate temple, topped by a winged female statue and featuring multiple white obelisks looming in the background."></a> 
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">Illustration by Mirco Paganessi</p> 
                </div> 
                <p>The Golden Road features a number of exciting new rules. If your character is looking to sneak off with the relics from the region, you might consider taking the Black Market Smuggler background. If you want to be tough as nails, you might take the living monolith archetype. PCs that want to live forever could consider trying to claim the sun orchid elixir for themselves or just enjoy a bit of pesh. Rahadoumi characters can even consider taking the Godless Healing feat to improve the power of science and medicine on their own bodies.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190827-godlesshealing.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190827-godlesshealing_500.png" alt="Godless Healing, Feat 2. Prerequisites: Battle Medicine, can't have a patron deity. You recover an additional 5 Hit Points from a successful attempt to Treat your Wounds or use Battle Medicine on you."></a> 
                </div> 
                <p>We then set sail from Rahadoum out to the open seas. The High Seas region is home such areas like the Shackles, Hermea, and Medoigalti Island, but not all locales here are at sea level. In fact, you can visit underwater settlements like the aquatic elf city of Irim or the algolthu settlement of Gholinom. PCs looking to visit these sites might do well to get a set of swim fins to help their swimming or a jellyfish lamp to help navigating the dark depths of the ocean. Such PCs will probably take the Undersea Enthusiast background. PCs that prefer to stay on dry land could choose to set out to Mediogalti Island and join up with the Red Mantis Assassins, taking their archetype in the process. The archetype grants proficiency with sawtooth sabres and at later levels even allows you to transform into a mantis yourself!</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190827-mantisform.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190827-mantisform_500.png" alt="Mantis Form, Focus 4. Uncommon, Polymorph, Transmutation. Cast: somatic, verbsal. Duration: 1 minute. You become a mantis. You gain the effects of insect form, heightened to mantis form's level, and you can only transform into a mantis."></a> 
                </div> 
                <p>If we travel into the Inner Sea and head east, we eventually reach the Impossible Lands. So named because of the impressive and awe-inspiring nations it bears, the Impossible Lands region is home to Geb, Nex, the Mana Wastes, and Jalmeray.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190827-houseofperfection.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190827-houseofperfection_500.jpeg" alt="A three-tiered pagoda-like building with golden roofs and red trim sits surrounded by lush forest."></a> 
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">Illustration by Ainur Salimova</p> 
                </div> 
                <p>Characters from the Impossible Lands have a number of impressive options to choose. You could choose to join one of the Houses of Perfection in Jalmeray, taking the student of perfection archetype in the process. The archetype features an option for each of the Houses of Perfection’s four monasteries and is a great pick for anyone who is an expert in unarmed attacks. You could instead seek the secrets of the archmagi Nex by taking the Eye of the Arclords feat or Nexian Mystic background.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190827-nexianmystic.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190827-nexianmystic_500.png" alt="Nexian Mystic, Background. Your initiations into the Nexian mysteries and the philosophies of the Arclords of Nex grant you a preternatural comprehension of the arcane underpinnings of existence."></a> 
                </div> 
                <p>Once we head inland, we reach the Mwangi Expanse. This vast jungle is home to the people of Vidrian, the nation formerly known as Sargava, the flooded ruins of the Sodden Lands, and the dozens of city-states that dot the Mwangi Expanse. Characters from the Mwangi might be lizardfolk (again, see the <i>Lost Omens Character Guide</i>!) or one of the Mwangi orcs that takes the Blessed Tattoo feat to defend themselves from the influence of the demon lord Angazhan. Of particular note is the Magaambya, the oldest arcane academy in the Inner Sea region, located in Nantambu. Characters who are members of the Magaambya might take the magic warrior archetype or the Magaambya Academic background.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190827-magaambyaacademic.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190827-magaambyaacademic_500.png" alt="Magaambya Academic, Background. You studied magic at the prestigious Magaambya academy in Nantambu, learning magical traditions dating back to Old-Mage Jatembe and earning a pedigree respected by magical scholars almost everywhere."></a> 
                </div> 
                <p>Returning to Avistan, we land in the region known as Old Cheliax. This region is home to one of the oldest nations on Avistan as well as one of the oldest. Visitors to Old Cheliax can go see Isger, Nidal, Ravounel, and, of course, Cheliax.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190827-kintargo.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190827-kintargo_500.jpeg" alt="A massive ivory dome decorated with spires and towers sits on a hill overlooking the walled seaside city of Kintargo."></a> 
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">Illustration by Mirco Paganessi</p> 
                </div> 
                <p>Characters from the Old Cheliax region have plenty of backgrounds to choose from, such the Thrune Loyalist background or the Chelish Rebel background for those who aren’t as happy with Queen Abrograil and her rule. The region’s archetype is the Hellknight armiger, which represents a Hellknight in training. Characters can take the archetype as early as second level. A fun fact about the archetype is that it is designed to dovetail into the full-fledged Hellknight archetype that is premiering later in the Lost Omens Character Guide.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190827-hellknightarmigerdedication.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190827-hellknightarmigerdedication_500.png" alt="Hellknight Armiger Dedication, Feat 2. Uncommon, Archetype, Dedication. Prerequisites: member of a Hellknight order; trained in heavy armor as well as your order's favorite weapon. Access: You are from  Old Cheliax. Your Hellknight training teaches you to terrorize others into compliance, but you also study the stricture and hierarchy of Hell."></a> 
                </div> 
                <p>As we continue north, we reach the Saga Lands. The Saga Lands region is one of the most storied areas in Pathfinder’s history and is home to the newly-founded New Thassilon, the Lands of the Linnorm Kings, the Realm of the Mammoth Lords, Irrisen, and Varisia.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190827-eurithina.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190827-eurithina_500.jpeg" alt="Citizens mill about a wide dirt road between two rows of high-roofed structures, one of which is decorated with red paper lanterns.

                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">Illustration by Ainur Salimova</p> 
                </div> 
                <p>With so many lands steeped in magic, it’s no surprise that the region offers a number of magical options. Saga Lands characters could be a time-displaced character from New Thassilon with the Thassilonian Traveler background. Those with ties to the witches of Irrisen might look forward to the return of the <i>snowball</i> spell. Of course, you might not have innate magic, especially if you have the Mammoth Speaker background. No worries, my magicless friends! You can now take the runescarred archetype, which requires no spellcasting prowess whatsoever, and cover yourself in magical runes to gain new magical abilities!</p>

                <p>Finally, as we wrap up our mechanical tour, we arrive in the Shining Kingdoms. It doesn’t get more traditional high fantasy than this region! With areas like Druma, Kyonin, the Five Kings Mountains, Galt, Andoran, and Taldor, the Shining Kingdoms are perfect for games starring knights in shining armor. Characters from the region could be from the wilds of the Verduran Forest with the Wildwood Local background or be a more sophisticated, city type with the Taldan Schemer background. Fans of intrigue might consider taking the Lion Blade archetype. Not all of the content here is fun and exciting for players, though, as is evident with the entry for Galt’s <i>final blades</i>. If you’re the type who wants to be a hero for the people, you could even consider joining the Eagle Knights of Andoran!</p>

                <p>Well, we made it around the Inner Sea Region and we just scratched the surface on what’s available in the <i>Lost Omens World Guide</i>! If this taste of dozens of backgrounds, ten archetypes, and so much more was enticing, consider picking up the book! I’m excited for all players, be they Pathfinder veterans or newcomers to Second Edition, to check out this book. Golarion is an exciting for games, so go and tell some great stories!</p>

               <blockquote> 
                <p>“Down!” </p> 
                <p itemprop="description">Navasi grabbed Keskodai and yanked him around the corner, sending him sprawling as lasers sliced through the space he’d occupied a moment before. She returned fire, then ducked back behind cover and glared at the shirren. “I thought I told you to go in disguise!”</p> 
                <p>From the floor, Keskodai looked up at her, mental voice radiating confusion. “But I <i>am</i> in disguise.”</p> 
                <p>Navasi squinted. “You look exactly the same.”</p> 
                <p>“The same?!” The shirren’s throat-teeth splayed wide in shock. “I took off my headpiece! I <i>shaved my moustache!</i>”</p> 
                <p>Navasi leaned closer. Sure enough, the chitin above his mouthparts was smooth. She fought the urge to put her head in her hands, instead settling for thrusting her plasma pistol around the corner and firing blind. Doing her best to keep her voice level, she said, “I don’t think that was enough.”</p> 
                <p>“But it’s my signature style! It’s how everyone recognizes me!”</p> 
                <p>Navasi entertained a brief but deeply fulfilling fantasy of throttling the shirren right there. Was it even wrong to strangle a death priest, ethically speaking? Wouldn’t sending him to Pharasma be like giving a dance-pop fan the chance to meet Sylix the Siren? </p> 
                <p>But the first rule of captaining was not killing your own people, even when they really deserved it. Instead, she took a calming breath and said, “You’re right—they must have been using advanced facial recognition software.” Then she darted her head around the corner.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/image002.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/image002_500.jpeg" alt="Navasi, the iconic envoy, peeks around the corner of a starship corridor, narrowly dodging a yellow energy beam fired by a four-armed security robot at the opposite end."></a>

                </div> 
                <p>Her fusillade of plasma bolts had produced the desired effect—sort of. The gangsters had indeed pulled back out of the line of fire, as she’d hoped. But in their place, they’d sent in a security bot. </p> 
                <p>Where in the worlds had these lowlifes gotten a patrol-class model? The thing stalked toward her with a fluid mechanical gait, mirrored face scanning. </p> 
                <p>She wasn’t quick enough. Even as she jerked backward, the robot fired, a line of crackling electricity burning down the corridor. It missed her face, but her scarf wasn’t so lucky—the artificial lightning burned straight through its trailing end, flames curling up from singed threads.</p> 
                <p>“Damn it, Keskodai! That’s coming out of your share!” She snapped off another blind shot, then cued coms. “Quig! We need evac. Like, yesterday.”</p> 
                <p>“Copy that, fearless leader.” The rat’s voice came smooth and calm. “They see through Keskodai’s disguise?”</p> 
                <p>“Advanced facial recognition software,” Keskodai said. The priest didn’t even have the grace to sound embarrassed.</p> 
                <p>Quig clucked his tongue. “I figured something was up. The bay started swarming with Iovan’s thugs—I had to take off to keep them from boarding the ship.”</p> 
                <p>“You’re not in the docking bay?” Navasi’s heart lurched. She’d known in her heart that escape wouldn’t be easy—there was only one way off this station, so of course Iovan and his goons would try to cut them off. But this was a whole new level of busted.</p> 
                <p>“Don’t worry, Captain, I’ve got you an alternative.” Quig sounded even more self-satisfied than usual, if such a thing were possible. “There’s a maintenance lock at the apex of the main dome. I’ll be there in ninety seconds.”</p> 
                <p>“The main dome?!” Navasi couldn’t believe what she was hearing. “You want us to go <i>back</i> to the casino?” </p> 
                <p>“They’ll never expect it.”</p> 
                <p>“That’s because it’s stupid!”</p> 
                <p>“But it’s <i>our</i> kind of stupid.” Keskodai sounded positively cheerful. He crouched in a sprinter’s stance. “Ready when you are, Captain. May Pharasma bless us.”</p> 
                <p>“I’d rather she continue ignoring us.” But Navasi crouched as well. “Ready? Go!”</p> 
                <p>They burst from behind the corner, back the way Keskodai had come. The security bot was closer now, the emboldened gangsters creeping along behind it. Navasi raised her pistols, but even as she fired Keskodai darted forward, one hand to his temple. He thrust out with the other, and a wave of invisible force blasted outward, bowling bot and thugs backward like they’d been sucked out an airlock.</p> 
                <p>Then they were past them, tearing out of the corridor and into the grimy little station’s central casino. Glowing game machines and tables of crusty-looking spacers and only slightly less crusty courtesans packed every available inch, creating a maze of colors and chimes. Above it all rose a tall, transparent dome revealing the stars beyond—and the looming shape of her own ship as Quig matched the station’s rotation.</p> 
                <p>“There!” Navasi pointed to a ladder climbing one of the support struts, then vaulted up onto a felt-topped table, scattering chips and holograms. She leapt to the next table, then the next, using them like stones in a river crossing, Keskodai hot on her heels.</p> 
                <p>They reached the ladder. Behind them, the trail of angry shouts grew louder.</p> 
                <p>She climbed. Ten feet up, she looked back and realized Keskodai wasn’t following. “Kesk! Come on!”</p> 
                <p>The shirren had his head bowed, mouthparts clacking as he prayed aloud. Then he lifted his hands to the wall and began to climb, spidering up the dome’s sheer face faster than Navasi on her ladder.</p> 
                <p>Well, good for him. Navasi grit her teeth and climbed harder. </p> 
                <p>Her back itched, waiting for the bullet or laser blast. They were completely exposed out here on the wall, but that was part of the point: if they were lucky, nobody would dare shoot at them for fear of puncturing the dome and venting the whole place. </p> 
                <p>Of course, if they were unlucky, some drunken gangster wouldn’t think of that until it was too late. Long-term thinking wasn’t exactly these folks’ strong suit. It all came down to luck—appropriate enough for a casino, she supposed.</p> 
                <p>Above, Keskodai reached the airlock and cycled it open, clambering inside. Navasi’s shoulders burned as the angle of the ladder increased, the dome’s pitch threatening to peel her backward off a wall rapidly becoming a ceiling. Leaned back at this angle, she could see the bright gleam of the <i>Maiden</i> as Quig nestled it down against the hatch.</p> 
                <p>She was almost to the apex now, the ladder nearly horizontal, forcing her to hook her ankles around each rung, the floor a dizzying distance below. She leaned her head back, concentrating on the hatch.</p> 
                <p>Keskodai’s inverted head popped out of it, the casualness of his climbing magic giving her momentary vertigo as her brain tried to convince her that the two of them were right-side up, and the rest of the world was upside down.</p> 
                <p>“Faster!” he shouted in her brain. </p> 
                <p>On the floor below, something coughed. There was a single instant of blurred motion, and then the ladder between them exploded in a fireball.</p> 
                <p>Navasi’s hands tore free of the ladder. Suddenly she was hanging, arms waving helplessly as she dangled from a foot wedged painfully between two rungs.</p> 
                <p>“Captain!” Keskodai was out of the hatch in an instant, skittering across the dome’s underside until he reached her. He leaned down and she grabbed his hand, letting him aid her in the world’s worst abdominal crunch until she could bend double and catch the ladder’s rungs again.</p> 
                <p>Or what was left of them. Between her and the hatch, the last twenty feet of the ladder had been blown completely clear of the wall, nothing left to cling to but smooth, transparent polycarbon and jagged shards of white-hot metal. </p> 
                <p>Twenty feet or twenty miles, it didn’t matter—the hatch might as well be in another star system.</p> 
                <p>Except that next to her, her priest stuck to the dome as if he were a magnet.</p> 
                <p>“Keskodai!” she shouted. “Can you cast that spell on me?”</p> 
                <p>“I’m sorry, Captain—that was the last of my spells. But I’ve got the next best thing.” He turned, thrusting his armored butt in her direction. “Get on my back!”</p> 
                <p>“Your back?” She looked at his skinny limbs. “You can’t carry me! We’ll both fall!”</p> 
                <p>“Maybe!” he chirped. “If so, we’ll go meet the Lady together!” As she’d predicted, he didn’t sound particularly upset at the idea.</p> 
                <p>She had a choice, then. She could order him to save himself, to leave her to the gangsters or gravity. He might even do it. She was his captain, after all.</p> 
                <p>But that would violate the <i>real</i> first rule of captaining: You trusted your people. Always.</p> 
                <p>She let go of the ladder and swung out, grabbing for his shoulders.</p> 
                <p>The scramble into the hatch was a stomach-churning blur, Navasi clinging to the shirren like a baby monkey on its mother’s back. But then they were through, the airlock cycling behind them, making one final lurch up into the ship’s cockpit to collapse on the floor.</p> 
                <p>“Howdy, boss.” Quig swiveled the pilot’s seat to face them. “Where to?”</p> 
                <p>“Anywhere,” Navasi gasped. “Just out of here, please.”</p> 
                <p>“You got it.” Quig tapped a command on the console, and the engines engaged. Then he spun back sharply, furry eyebrows rising.</p> 
                <p>“Keskodai!” he blurted. “What happened to your ’stache?”</p>

                <p>Ketchi twitched his long moustache at Wik's sarcasm. "Since reports of those curs and other slavers setting up operations in the area have been so prevalent, and I can't really <i>tell</i> if that's Coriv's crew in the cage from here, I’ll go with the big blue crossed swords painted on the wall. Even if that’s not our friends, <i>someone’s</i> clearly in need of our help."</p> 
                <p>"Keep it down, both of you!" Layali's dark eyes shone like chips of obsidian above her face scarf. She wore the scarf to hide the scars she'd received while a slave for speaking disrespectfully to her master. If there was anything on Golarion she hated more than slavers, Ketchi didn't know what it was. "I count seven slavers. There may be more inside the ruins. We need to free Coriv's crew to even the odds."</p> 
                <p>"Think the one in the crow's cage is alive?" Wik asked.</p> 
                <p>"We'll find out later." Layali flexed her hand on the hilt of her sword. "First, we open the cage."</p> 
                <p>"Diversion?" Ketchi suggested. "I <i>love</i> diversions. They’re my specialty!"</p> 
                <p>"Crazy gnome," Wik hissed.</p> 
                <p>Ketchi winked at the half-elf. "You bet your pointy ears. Aren't we all?"</p> 
                <p>"Valid point," Wik admitted.</p> 
                <p>"Quiet!" Layali pointed to the left. "Draw them off that way, Ketchi. Wik, you cover him. I'll slip through the ruins and open the cage." She patted the heavy satchel full of weapons. "Tell Darik and Bosk they're our rear guard. When all hell breaks loose, they come in."</p> 
                <p>"Right." Ketchi slipped back through the underbrush as silent as a ferret to where the warriors were hiding. He tapped Darik on his armored shoulder and took some satisfaction in the big knight's surprise.</p> 
                <p>"Bloody gnome! Don't startle me like that!"</p> 
                <p>"Shhh!" Ketchi held a finger to his lips and whispered the plan. Bosk frowned through his thick Ulfen beard, but Darik nodded. "Just wait for the screaming to start, then come running."</p> 
                <p>"Screaming?" Bosk narrowed his eyes. "Hyena-men don't scream."</p> 
                <p>Ketchi twirled his moustache. "No, but <i>I</i> do." He slipped into the brush and worked his way around the camp, confident that the slavers wouldn't hear, see, or smell him. The crew had done this many times, and knew their jobs. In this instance, they were rescuing fellow Firebrands—a team of Bellflower tillers—instead of slaves or refugees, but it amounted to the same thing. How Coriv's crew had been captured in the first place did concern the gnome, but not overmuch. In his opinion, prisoners existed to be freed, regardless of who they were or how they got there.</p> 
                <p>Finally in place, Ketchi peered over a fallen log to assess the situation. The slavers crouched around a firepit, arguing and gnawing on haunches of meat. Hopefully that meat wasn't one of Coriv's people. Smoke wafted from one of the old monastery's chimneys, so there were probably more. No matter; once they freed Coriv's crew, the odds would be in their favor.</p> 
                <p>Ketchi unwound the long scarf from his belt, quietly cleared his throat, and meowed.</p> 
                <p>Fourteen furry ears swiveled as one toward the noise. Ketchi grinned and meowed again, louder. Their bloody muzzles rose from their meal, noses sniffing the air. Another meow, and the slavers snarled and spat back and forth in their barking, yipping language. Ketchi didn't need an interpreter. <i>Come on you canine cretins, come and get the nice kitty</i>. He meowed again, and three of the four slavers rose to investigate. The others watched them approach the edge of the camp.</p> 
                <p>Beyond them, Layali crept along the edge of the monastery toward the cage. <i>Perfect!</i> Ketchi cupped his hands around his mouth and summoned his quirky arcane talent. "Meeeeow!" The sound seemed to come from a clump of bushes some fifty feet beyond his hiding place.</p> 
                <p>The slavers snarled and strode forth, stepping over the log where Ketchi hid. They had their swords out now, and crouched low to inspect the bushes.</p> 
                <p><i>Showtime!</i> Ketchi dashed forth and leaped to scramble up the nearest slaver's back, flinging his scarf up and around his stunned target's eyes.</p> 
                <p>"Yeeehaw! <i>Ride</i> that dog!" Ketchi dug his heels into the thrashing slaver's neck and belted out a bawdy rhyme. "Oh, I'm a dog rider, a dog rider is me, tra-la-la, tra-la-la-lee."</p> 
                <p>The slaver thrashed and howled. His two companions brandished their weapons, but couldn't slash at Ketchi without risking taking off their friend's head. The others lurched up from the campfire and charged. Beyond them, Layali worked on the cage lock. Wik stood from his hiding place and sent an arrow into the rearmost of the charging slavers. Darik and Bosk charged from hiding, weapons drawn, but so far, all attention remained fixed upon Ketchi.</p> 
                <p><i>As it should be</i>, he thought, belting out another verse, struggling to keep hold of his scarf among his blindfolded mount’s thrashing.</p> 
                <p>Then everything went sideways.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/082919_BadDogs.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/082919_BadDogs_500.jpeg" alt="An armored knight with a sword and shield and a half-elf with a long bow battle four ferocious gnolls, while a masked humanoid frees captives from a wooden cage in the background."></a>

                </div> 
                <p>A cloaked figure appeared in the window of the monastery, her voice crying out an arcane phrase accented by growls and clacking teeth. The slaver Ketchi was riding, and all the rest of them for that matter, suddenly grew in stature to ogre-height. Ketchi hung on and belted out another verse, but drew a dagger with his free hand, just in case. Wik felled one of the enlarged slavers with a lightning-fast volley, but another of the beast-men threw a spear and caught Bosk in the stomach. The warrior folded over like a sawdust doll. Darik bellowed a battle cry and shattered his enemy's shield with a sword stroke.</p> 
                <p>Ketchi drove his dagger into the slaver's neck and continued his ballad, shifting the theme from one of distraction to encouragement. He sprinkled helpful hints to his allies among his lyrics while dodging the slaver's clumsy attempts to drag him off.</p> 
                <p>Layali had the cage open, and handed out swords to Coriv's crew as they poured out. Several of them dashed into the monastery, and more shouts rang out as they clashed with the robed spellcaster and any other slavers in the ruin.</p> 
                <p>Ketchi stabbed again, and Wik felled yet another slaver with two shots to the chest. Then another slaver lashed out with a long whip. The leather wrapped around Ketchi's neck and jerked hard enough to cut his song short and unseat him. He held his grip on the scarf, however, unbalancing the slaver as he fell.</p> 
                <p>Ketchi landed hard enough to knock the wind out of his lungs, but he got a hand around the whip to keep it from throttling him. The slaver he'd stabbed had dropped his sword, but lunged at the fallen gnome, jaws wide. Ketchi jerked the whip hard and rolled. Slavering jaws snapped closed an inch from his shoulder. The whip wielder brought his shield down hard, and the edge caught the gnome on the knee.</p> 
                <p>Ketchi howled in pain, "Ayeee, I'll never dance again!"</p> 
                <p>The shield came up for another blow, but two arrows thunked into the slaver's throat. He looked suddenly surprised and fell backward. The other, however, landed on Ketchi like a fallen tree, clawed hands grasping and jaws wide.</p> 
                <p>"<i>Bad</i> dog! No biting the nice gnome!" Ketchi drew another dagger and thrust deep into that maw. The teeth closed on his arm and he howled in pain again, but the slaver went limp as it bit down on the gnome’s upturned blade.</p> 
                <p>Quiet...</p> 
                <p>The fight was over. Coriv's crew waved from the monastery window and reached out to pull the crow's cage in. The shape inside moved, alive at least. Darik knelt to Bosk, pressing a bottle to the old warrior's lips.</p> 
                <p>Ketchi tried to pry the slaver’s jaws open, but they seemed to be locked closed. "A little help, please!" He tried again, but failed to pry the teeth from his arm. "I seem to have a <i>dog</i> attached to my arm!"</p> 
                <p>"Need a hand?" Wik reached down with a knife to carefully slice the seized jaw muscles.</p> 
                <p>"I nearly <i>lost</i> a hand." He winced as the bite relaxed and the teeth came free. "Thanks! Nice shooting, by the way." Ketchi unwound the whip from his neck and cleared his throat. His knee throbbed, his voice rasped, and his arm was bleeding.</p> 
                <p>"Nice performance." Wik drew a potion bottle from his satchel and handed it down. "And nice riding."</p> 
                <p>"I'm thinking of taking the act on the road." Ketchi downed the sweet elixir and sighed in bliss as the pain faded. He lurched up to his feet and tested his knee, then his voice. "La-la-la! What do you think; Ketchi the dog-riding gnome and his canine companions?"</p> 
                <p>"I think you need to keep the day job." Wik chuckled and clapped his friend on the shoulder.</p> 
                <p>"Yeah, probably right." Ketchi toed the dead slaver and grinned. "Firebrand's pretty much a full-time gig."</p>

At the same time, the organized play team updated the Pathfinder Adventure Card Guild into the Pathfinder Adventure Card Society.

                <blockquote style="font-style:italic"> 
                 <p>Hi, I’m Jonathan and I’m one of the Venture Lieutenants for the Seattle region.&nbsp; We play weekly at the Mox Boarding House in Bellevue, which is one of the local staple game stores in the region.&nbsp; We are currently running through the previous Season, Season of Tapestry’s Tides.</p> 
                 <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190828-normalscenario.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190828-normalscenario_500.jpeg"></a> 
                 </div> 
                 <p>We have about 8-9 or so players a week, and often this presents to us a logistical dilemma - how do we balance out our party?&nbsp; The RPG side of the Pathfinder Society can often have this type of dilemma, but we often need to go through a much longer period of time with the same characters and parties - this could be fatal in higher level scenarios!</p> 
                 <p>Some days, we balance out our party perfectly, with a Strength character at each table, a Dexterity character, some healing, some Arcane… and then some time ago, we had a scenario where we decided to seat people according to when they arrived.&nbsp; We ended up with a party of Athnul, Hayato, Lirianne, and Seltyiel, and a party of Alahazra, 2 Linis, and Radillo. Guess where most of the high level weapons ended up? The poor weapon users keep telling us to share, and yet this has happened not once, but twice.&nbsp; Worse yet, this scenario just happens to punish non-magic users. Luckily, the martial table managed to make it through.</p> 
                 <p>One of the things I like the most about the Pathfinder Card Society scenarios is that the developers often use Society scenarios to test out interesting concepts.&nbsp; The concept of the Defensive Stance in Mummy’s Mask and the siege scenario was actually previewed in Season of the Runelords.&nbsp; When I first played that scenario, everything about it seemed new and different - I think I played way too many “defeat and corner the villain” scenarios at that point.&nbsp; Tapestry’s Tides also has a scenario like this:</p> 
                 <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190828-nineships.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190828-nineships_500.jpeg"></a> 
                 </div> 
                 <p>Instead of having locations, the scenario in question required you to fight on ships, then beat the actual ship to close the location.&nbsp; Luckily you didn’t actually need to close all 9 locations to win - that would have been a nightmare!</p> 
                 <p>With all the cards we bring every week to host a game, the box runners often have to find creative storage solutions.&nbsp; One of the box runners brings a set in a card bandoleer. I bring something that looks somewhat like a rounded-off suitcase.&nbsp; And one of the box runners has an actual, honest-to-goodness Pathfinder Adventure Chest:</p> 
                 <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190828-adventurechest.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190828-adventurechest_500.jpeg"></a> 
                 </div> 
                 <p>I’m very glad for the people in my region who are interested enough in the game to play through these Seasons.&nbsp; It has been great playing together with them and I hope to do this for a long time.</p>

Most of the adventure is a base invasion; some might even call it a “dungeon crawl in space.” But how was I to avoid the pitfalls that a dungeon crawl can bring?</p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190828-crucible.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190828-crucible_500.jpeg" alt="the crucible" align="left" style="padding-right: 25px; padding-bottom: 25px;"></a> 
                <p>The way I saw it, <em>Assault on the Crucible</em> had to have multiple paths. There had to be several competing factions inside the base, and more than one way for the PCs to gain critical information they could then use to make interesting choices. I set a goal for myself: I wanted an adventure in which every table had a different experience. It’s my hope that, when players get together to share their stories of the Crucible, no two groups will have the same story to tell.</p> 
                <p>I also wanted to create a sense of urgency and tension. This led to the development of a countdown system that represents General Khaim’s attack on the Burning Archipelago on the surface of the sun. The longer the PCs take in the Crucible, the more damage is done to the Archipelago; every encounter forces the PCs to make a choice: Is this a fight we absolutely have to have? I also added encounters that allow the PCs to undermine Khaim’s forces directly, partially rewinding the Countdown.</p> 
                <p>This is a high-level adventure, which means accommodating PCs armed with big, splashy, abilities. I spent a lot of time thinking about how PCs could quickly gather information with arcane eye, a mechanic’s scoutbot, an operative with cloaking field, or divination and mind probe. In an adventure filled with outsiders, dismissal and planar binding become important spells. I didn’t want to create a bunch of roadblocks to these powers. Instead, I wanted to make an adventure in which player characters had to use all their big guns if they were to have a chance of success. I wanted to not just permit and reward the use of high-level abilities, I wanted to make them an absolute necessity.</p> 
                <p>There’s so much more I could say about <em>Assault on the Crucible</em>. Writing it was a tremendous challenge, and I had the incredible help and support of Chris S. Sims, developer on this project and my friend. But my turn for talking is done, and now it’s your turn. </p> 
                <p>I want to know how you survived the Crucible… <em>if</em> you survived!</p>

                <p itemprop="description">Here we are at the last preview of the forthcoming <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01ztb?Pathfinder-Battles-Legendary-Adventures">Pathfinder Battles: Legendary Adventures</a> set of pre-painted plastic miniatures from our partners at WizKids. Over the last few weeks, we’ve seen all the Huge creatures and the player character- and NPC-appropriate figures in the set, but we’ve still got some of the set’s most menacing foes to show off today!</p> 
                <p>First, let’s look at the Orc Brawler and Orc Warlord, rounding out Legendary Adventures’s five orc figures. The brawler, the third common orc in the set, will round out many GM’s warbands, and shows off the new orc knuckle dagger weapon that debuted in Pathfinder Second Edition earlier this month. The warlord, for his part, occupies a rare slot in the set, and features a blasting horn to rally the orc hordes against their foes—perhaps against the undead armies of the Whispering Tyrant.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/082619_009_Orc_Brawler.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/082619_009_Orc_Brawler_500.jpeg" alt="Orc Brawler"></a> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/082619_037_Orc_Warlord.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/082619_037_Orc_Warlord_500.jpeg" alt="Orc Warlord"></a> 
                </div> 
                <p>If you didn’t get enough undead in previous Pathfinder Battles sets, like the undead-heavy Ruins of Lastwall set that came out this spring, we’ve got a few more to collect next month! Among the many monsters in the Pathfinder Bestiary that got a makeover between editions were the shadow, wraith, and wight, which all appear in this set as Uncommon medium figures. We really wanted to accentuate the spectral nature of the shadow and wraith, and you’ll notice the miniatures use translucent plastic to give them an eerie sense of not being fully there. The wight, with its bright red eyes and imposing pose, can also serve as a unique skeletal champion among a party of lower-level, mindless undead.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/082619_020_Shadow.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/082619_020_Shadow_360.jpeg" alt="Shadow"></a> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/082619_021_Wraith.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com//image/content/Blog/082619_021_Wraith_360.jpeg" alt="Wraith"></a> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/082619_023_Wight.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/082619_023_Wight_360.jpeg" alt="Wight"></a> 
                </div> 
                <p>Now that I’ve got that nightmare fuel firmly planted in your subconscious, how about an actual, literal nightmare? This Large rare figure is more than just the black horse with flaming hooves of past editions—it’s a horse corpse with a burning core of infernal flame. Whether that flame burns hotter than the hatred the beast feels for its rider’s enemies is something you’ll have to find out on your own, I just don’t recommend you find out the hard way.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/082619_041_Nightmare.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/082619_041_Nightmare_500.jpeg" alt="Nightmare"></a> 
                </div> 
                <p>Finally, we have the lonesome Yeti, a Large uncommon figure based on the new art in the <em>Pathfinder Bestiary</em> (which was itself based on the actual appearance of yetis in the real world). Don’t let this guy’s conehead fool you, though—he’s not from France, but he’d sure wreak havoc if let loose there!</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190827-yeti.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190827-yeti_500.jpeg" alt="It's a Yeti! Mouth open and snarling!'"></a> 
                </div> 
                <p>And with that, we’ve now seen all 44 figures (and variants) in the set. Pathfinder Battles: Legendary Adventures releases next month, and pre-orders and subscriptions are available right now. Secure your booster, brick, or case now and prepare for a life of legendary adventure!</p>

            <p itemprop="description">Nearly 20 years after the Goblinblood Wars devastated the nation of Isger, an army of hobgoblins marched toward conquest once more. Led by the formidable commander General Azaersi—who had lost everything in the Goblinblood Wars, as so many others had—the so-called Ironfang Invasion swept across the lands of Nirmathas and northern Molthune with what seemed like an unstoppable momentum. Yet the residents of Nirmathas managed to unite in their hour of need, rallied by a group of militia commanders that proved a match for the Ironfang Legion’s legendary general. In a move that surprised nearly everyone, the heroes of Nirmathas chose to show mercy to the merciless, sparing the general and suing for peace.

               <blockquote> 
                <p itemprop="description">Nearly 20 years after the Goblinblood Wars devastated the nation of Isger, an army of hobgoblins marched toward conquest once more. Led by the formidable commander General Azaersi—who had lost everything in the Goblinblood Wars, as so many others had—the so-called Ironfang Invasion swept across the lands of Nirmathas and northern Molthune with what seemed like an unstoppable momentum. Yet the residents of Nirmathas managed to unite in their hour of need, rallied by a group of militia commanders that proved a match for the Ironfang Legion’s legendary general. In a move that surprised nearly everyone, the heroes of Nirmathas chose to show mercy to the merciless, sparing the general and suing for peace. Azaersi agreed and pulled her armies back to her mysterious base of operations, the <i>Vault of the Onyx Citadel</i>, before officially founding the nation of Oprak in the mountains.</p> 
                <p>Which is a fancy story, but what does that have to do with playable hobgoblins? General Azaersi might have signed temporary non-aggression treaties with Nirmathas (and somewhat ominously, with Nidal), but that’s a far cry from welcoming the hated Ironfang Legion into human cities. In this case, it’s Tar-Baphon’s fault—the rise of the Whispering Tyrant suddenly has the flesh and blood, living and breathing hobgoblins looking like much more pleasant neighbors in comparison. Some highly optimistic diplomats even hope to convince the Ironfang Legion to help fight Tar-Baphon’s forces. After all, what are hobgoblins without a war?</p>

                <p>That’s the question we’re asking Pathfinder 2E players to help answer while they play in the Age of Lost Omens. Whether Azaersi is simply rebuilding her forces in order to invade again or has instead turned her ambitions toward economic conquest instead of martial, Oprak is currently a nation at peace. For a society comprised mostly of Goblinblood orphans and veterans, who have only known combat and preparation for combat since childhood, this sudden shift has led to a great deal of restlessness, soul-searching, aimless depression… and in some, curious exploration. Where previously the most brutal and efficient hobgoblins were the ones that excelled, less vicious hobgoblins are now carving a place for themselves as explorers and envoys to non-hobgoblin peoples.</p> 
                <p>Hobgoblins are an Uncommon ancestry. This might seem confusing, as Uncommon usually suggests that something must be found through effort in-game, and PCs can hardly switch ancestries mid-character! In this case, Uncommon is what we use to indicate that a particular ancestry is not necessarily found (or appropriate as PCs) in all areas of the Inner Sea region. A hobgoblin soldier PC would not fit well into the War for the Crown Adventure Path, for example—but that same PC could easily be found in the Eye of Dread meta-region, or even touring the lands of Nidal or Varisia. With that said, Azaersi’s control over the <i>Vault of the Onyx Citadel</i> means a hobgoblin can theoretically be found anywhere, as the general has managed to create magical pathways to regions as far-flung as the hobgoblin nation of Kaoling in Tian Xia!</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/082319_KaoLingHobgoblin.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com//image/content/Blog/082319_KaoLingHobgoblin_360.jpeg" alt="A Kao Ling hobgoblin in an ornate mask dual-wielding a sword and axe."></a>

                </div> 
                <p>Hobgoblins get 8 Hit Points from their ancestry, are Medium, and have a speed of 25 feet. A hobgoblin speaks Common and Goblin, plus any additional languages they might pick up. Hobgoblins have incredible endurance and are trained for physical discipline, giving them an ability boost to Constitution, and they possess keen minds, getting another ability boost in Intelligence. Like most ancestries, they also get one free ability boost to put in any score. Hobgoblins were originally created from goblins, however, meaning the two ancestries share an ability flaw to Wisdom. With these traits, hobgoblins seem like they’d be perfectly suited to be wizards… if not for the absolute, bone-deep loathing they hold toward almost all magic. Oops!</p> 
                <p>In fact, hobgoblins hate magic so much that they can choose the Elfbane Hobgoblin ancestry, which can help them resist spells:</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/082319_ElfbaneHobgoblin.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/082319_ElfbaneHobgoblin_500.jpeg" alt="Elfbane Hobgoblin. Hobgoblins were engineered long ago from the unreliable and fecund goblins, to be used as an army against the elves. Although the elves ultimately freed the hobgoblins from their bondage, some hobgoblins retain ancestral resistance to magic, which they refer to as “elf magic.” You gain the Resist Elf Magic reaction. RESIST ELF MAGIC (reaction). Trigger: You attempt a saving throw against a magical effect but haven’t rolled yet. Your ancestral resistance to magic protects you. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to the triggering saving throw. If the triggering effect is arcane, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus instead."></a> 
                </div> 
                <p>The hobgoblin ancestry entry also suggests some <i>Core Rulebook</i> backgrounds you might choose that are common for those of hobgoblin ancestry, but be sure to also check out specific backgrounds from the <i>Lost Omens World Guide</i> for other appropriate options, such as the Onyx Trader or Goblinblood Orphan backgrounds!</p>

               <blockquote> 
                <p>The light on the door pad blinked from red to green.</p> 
                <p itemprop="description">“Okay, you’re in.” Even though she was holed up in the data center, hacking the locks remotely, tension made Raia whisper. “The tracker chip I planted says Averly is in there. We need to get to him before they do... whatever it is they do to people.”</p> 
                <p>“Understood.” Keskodai stood from his place in the shadows. “I’m headed in.”</p> 
                <p>“Good hunting, Keskodai.”</p> 
                <p>Keskodai reached down to the child at his belt. “Ready, Chk Chk?”</p> 
                <p>Safe inside his canister, Chk Chk tapped his larval beak-tooth against the transparent polycarbon, treating Keskodai to a blast of confidence and enthusiasm.</p> 
                <p>Of course Chk Chk was confident. As far as he knew, his father was invincible. As was Chk Chk himself, for that matter. After all, hadn’t they survived one hundred percent of their adventures so far?</p> 
                <p>Keskodai knew better, yet some part of him still stood a little straighter at his child’s vision of him. Wasn’t that what drove every parent? A desire to be the person their child imagined them to be?</p> 
                <p>He stepped forward and keyed the door.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/082219_CathedralsOfTheMind.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/082219_CathedralsOfTheMind_500.jpeg" alt="Keskodai, the iconic mystic, unleases a blast of psychic energy against an enemy Gray alien, who clutches his head in pain as the magic washes over him."></a>

                <p>It swept aside, revealing a room full of strange equipment. Pumps whirred and hissed, spotlights stabbing down through the gloom to illuminate a shaved human lying nude on the central table. That was their contact, all right. Robotic arms like something out of Keskodai’s medical bay prodded at the inert body, injecting fluids or implanting subdermal machinery. And standing over it all—</p> 
                <p>The gray jerked upright, its movements an eerie, strobe-light stutter. It stretched a hand toward Keskodai, and he felt the sudden press of its mind—an overwhelming impulse to freeze, to sleep. It tugged at his synapses, seeking to reshape them with the force of its will.</p> 
                <p>But shirren already escaped such slavery once. Keskodai raised his pistol and fired.</p> 
                <p>The shot was dead-on: straight to the heart, the sort of merciful deathblow Keskodai thought of as the Lady’s Grace. Yet it passed through the gray like it was a hologram, the creature’s flesh seeming to ripple out of phase with reality. For a nanosecond, it was gone, and then it was there again, the bullet ricocheting harmlessly off the wall behind it.</p> 
                <p>Keskodai, on the other hand, had no such protections. He dove sideways behind a bank of machinery as the thing sighted its own weapon and fired, needles driving deep into the doorjamb.</p> 
                <p>So be it, Keskodai thought. If mercy wasn’t an option...</p> 
                <p>He stood, one hand out for focus, and shoved his way inside the gray’s head.</p> 
                <p>The creature’s mind was truly alien. In some ways, the neural pathways were structurally similar to Keskodai’s own, but without shared context or a known starting point, the thought processes that ran along them were nearly impossible to decipher. He’d heard Raia speak of different types of computer encryption, and this was like that—he could see the <i>shapes</i> of ideas, gliding past him like leviathans in a darkened sea, without having any idea what they <i>meant</i>.</p> 
                <p>But you didn’t need to know how something worked to smash it. Keskodai focused his magic and <i>pushed</i>.</p> 
                <p>The gray doubled over, screaming soundlessly as Keskodai’s spell surged through its neurons, scrambling synapses. Keskodai felt a momentary pang of regret—then plastered over it with the memory of what these creatures had done on Thersius 4. He pushed again, expanding his mental presence inside the creature’s skull, inflating until there was no room for anything else.</p> 
                <p>The creature gave a final twitch and collapsed to the ground.</p> 
                <p>Keskodai gasped and let the magic drop, grabbing the console for support as his mind dizzily readjusted to being back in his own body. He put one hand to Chk Chk’s canister—safely intact.</p> 
                <p>“I’m sorry you had to see that,” Keskodai said. </p> 
                <p>Chk Chk responded with a wave of fierce pride. </p> 
                <p>Keskodai tapped the canister in negation. “No, Chk Chk. That wasn’t good. Necessary, perhaps, but never good. Minds are sacred—they’re what make each of us unique. To shatter one like that, even in self-defense, is to take a sledgehammer to a cathedral.”</p> 
                <p>Chk Chk’s response was dubious, the telepathic sentiment accompanied by a rare image flash: Pharasma’s spiral, glowing in the air above Keskodai’s head.</p> 
                <p>The message was clear: if the Lady of Graves was content to let Keskodai take lives, then so was Chk Chk.</p> 
                <p>Keskodai’s antennae drooped in a sigh. He’d been worrying about this more and more, lately. Had his faith in Pharasma made Chk Chk too cavalier about death? Of course he couldn’t expect a larva to understand when it was acceptable to cut short a life, the differences between a death that furthered Pharasma’s plan and one that furthered your own. All the child saw was a father grown comfortable with killing. </p> 
                <p>Keskodai had never wanted to indoctrinate the child. Show him the galaxy, yes, and teach him as best he could, but it was crucial that Chk Chk feel free to walk his own path. </p> 
                <p>And one day, no doubt, he would. He’d leave Keskodai behind, the same way Keskodai had left his own parents. After years of constant company, Keskodai would be truly alone once more.</p> 
                <p>But there was no time to worry about that now. Keskodai hurried to the operating table. With the gray’s death, the robotic arms had gone limp—psychically driven, perhaps? That could be useful in Keskodai’s own medical bay. But he yanked them free, casting his senses down into the man’s flesh and letting the healing magic flow.</p> 
                <p>Except that it wasn’t needed. The man—their contact, who had called himself Averly—seemed perfectly healthy. Whatever the gray had implanted in him, it didn’t seem to be harming him. He didn’t even seem to be sedated, by any conventional or magical means. </p> 
                <p>Yet he didn’t wake at Keskodai’s touch. Keskodai shook him harder, slapping him gently on the cheeks, then less gently. He even spat on a battery and pressed its contact points to the man’s skin, shocking him. Yet still the man slept.</p> 
                <p>And now, Keskodai thought to himself, we set another bad example...</p> 
                <p>“Chk Chk,” he said. “Remember what I said about minds being sacred? That’s why you should normally never invade a friend’s without their consent. But sometimes, we must hurt to heal.”</p> 
                <p>And with that, he dove once again into the mind of another.</p> 
                <p>This intrusion was gentler—an attempt to read a book, not tear out its pages. The comatose man’s thoughts were a familiar human structure, yet in some ways that made the content stranger. The man wasn’t quite asleep, but neither was he awake. His thoughts routed around the edges of strange, artificial holes. Yet certain images recurred. A face... a ship...</p> 
                <p>A warning. Keskodai broke contact and cued his coms. “Raia?”</p> 
                <p>“Keskodai! Did it work? Is our contact okay?”</p> 
                <p>Keskodai looked down at the comatose man, locked inside his alien dreams.</p> 
                <p>“After a fashion,” he said. “But listen—we need to get back to Navasi and the others. Immediately.”</p> 
                <p>He could feel her come alert. “Why?” </p> 
                <p>Keskodai lifted the unconscious man in his arms and turned toward the door.</p> 
                <p>“Because I know who they’re going after next.”</p>

                <p>As Starfinder Society players are aware, I am responsible for the psychedelic-colored, four-tusked walrus aliens, the morlamaws. If you haven’t had a chance to play Starfinder Society Scenario #1-08: <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9x0y?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-108-Sanctuary-of-Drowned-Delight">Sanctuary of Drowned Delight</a>, then I hope you enjoy your introduction to these bizarre but orderly creatures of the deep sea in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01zof/">Alien Archive 3</a>. I certainly didn’t expect when I first wrote them how much they were going to resonate with players, and I was delighted to get to expand on the morlamaws, their home, and what they’re up to now. I got to ask such questions as what kind of musical instruments work underwater and how would morlamaws dance? My original task when writing the scenario was to create something memorable and distinct from other underwater aliens, and I certainly feel like I succeeded there. Hope you all enjoy!</p>

                <p>Jinsuls were the Big Bad of Starfinder Society Season 1: Year of the Scoured Stars, and they certainly had a larger-than-life presence—both as antagonists and as the source of endless hashtags like #LegBladesForDays and #VivaKadrical. Despite Season 1 being full of aliens, jinsuls were the first species we encountered that felt truly <i>unknown</i>; we just didn’t know what they wanted—except to kill us. As creatures created with Organized Play in mind, I designed the jinsuls to specifically combat certain common builds—casters, operatives, and melee fighters. While no one jinsul can counter all of them, I wanted to give GMs the flexibility when building these to add in abilities based on the party composition of their players. Even low-level jinsuls without extra special abilities are endlessly entertaining, and they toe the fun line between “this could really kill us!” and “phew, we took that one down!” I hope to see jinsuls spread far across the Starfinder universe, and that they stop doing biomedical experiments on adorable sharktopus space puppies. </p>

                <p>Z-z-zap! Dirindi are an electrically attuned race who love to use their spell like ability as a joy buzzer to give each other playful zaps in greeting. Those who are not adventurers often have no idea how annoying these zaps are to other people. I decided early that dirindi playfulness would translate into a love of stories and humor. Their relationship with the facts is sometimes hazy, making their newscasts simultaneously wildly inaccurate and incredibly popular.</p> 
                <p>Dirindi are one of the two races that co-govern the Liavaran moon Arkanen. Collaborating with Katina Davis, who wrote Sazarons, we decided that our races were best buddies who complement each other well. Dirindis provide creativity, optimism, and ideas, while the scholarly sazarons make sure projects stay on schedule and on budget. I hope they spark joy in your games.</p>

                <p>I DEFINITELY didn’t just write these so I can have one named Kazooie and an uplifted bear named Banjo. NOPE NOT AT ALL. In all seriousness, I wrote these charismatic, enigmatic folks for those kinds of people in your life that you instantly fall in love with—not necessarily romantically, but those that are the life of the party and have that uncanny ability to get along with anyone. I met a lot of these kinds of people in L.A. We became fast friends, but everyone’s just kinda doing their own thing and eventually drift apart. Espraksas are usually in your life short-term, because nothing gets in the way of their life goals of traveling the universe and learning everything they can before returning to their home world. I guess it’s kind of sad, but never fear—espraksa friends will always remember you, and who knows, maybe their travels will take them to your home planet!</p>

                <p>The cephalumes were initially created at the Designing Aliens panel of PaizoCon 2018, with Jason Keeley, Lyz Liddell, Luis Loza, Joe Pasini, and guest artist Taylor Fischer, where the audience and panelists collaborated to develop a creature while Taylor illustrated it. It was important to maintain the elements that resonated most with the audience, such as their liquid hydrocarbon environment, but also add enough new material to still make a fun read for everyone who participated. One of my favourite things about the cephalumes is the way they communicate. They 'speak' Lumos, a visual language comprised of sequential blinks of their racial bioluminescence. When other races communicate in Lumos, I imagine they make clicking sounds, or apply tactile pressure, in place of each blink.</p>

                <p><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq0205s?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-205-Meeting-of-Queens">Starfinder Society Scenario #2-05: Meeting of Queens</a> was written by Kiel Howell and brings us back to the Pact World of Castrovel. This time, we’re going to explore a continent that the Society has yet to really explore: the Colonies, home of the ant-like formians. The formians only recently ceased their war with another of Castrovel’s prominent species, the lashuntas. Long ago, the formians warred against themselves, and a great gathering known as the Meeting of Queens paved the way for the formians to come together as a unified people. This month’s scenario has the PCs join a recreation of this historic event, joining with the first ever lashunta-delegation allowed to participate. Readers may remember Kiel from his work on <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01wkn">Starfinder Society Scenario #1-30: Survivor’s Salvation</a> and should look forward to another scenario filled with excellent NPC interactions and unique challenges.</p>

                <p>Our second August scenario comes from Pathfinder and Starfinder Society veteran, Mike Kimmel. I knew I wanted to get Mike onboard with our first two-part scenario, and he really knocked it out of the park with <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq0205t?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-206-The-Stumbling-Society-Part-1-Sangoros-Lament">Starfinder Society Scenario #2-06: The Stumbling Society, Part 1: Sangoro’s Lament</a>. OK, so there’s a lot to parse from that long title. First, it’s a two-parter, and while it and next month’s follow-up, Starfinder Society Scenario #2-08: The Stumbling Society, Part 2: Sangoro’s Gifts, don’t need to be played one after another, we would highly recommend groups do their best to arrange the two scenarios in order. Secondly, this scenario references a major figure from the Society’s past: Sangoro, the vesk responsible for creating the Exo-Guardians faction. Sufficed to say, there’s some lore delving that’s going to happen about the Exo-Guardians former base of operations, lost around the time of the Scoured Stars incident. Finally, this scenario really kicks off some of the overarching year storyline that we’re telling, so I highly recommend that players (both new and veteran) slot this on their schedules as soon as they can!</p>

                <p>That’s it for this month. Come back on September 18th, when we provide some previews of our next batch of scenarios. We’ve already given a bit of a preview for one scenario, which is <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sguj?Choosing-the-Future-Path">something set to change the face of the Starfinder Society worldwide campaign</a>! Be sure to stop by and check our preview blog for that scenario, and the sequel to this month’s two-parter opening. Otherwise, next week brings another guest blog, regarding Pathfinder Adventure Card Society, and some discussion of where we are at with Pathfinder Society (2nd edition) launch.</p> 
                <p>For those of you wondering where this month’s Pathfinder Society scenario previews are... well, <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgso?Pathfinder-Societys-Gen-Con-2019-Scenarios">we’ve already released those in advance for GenCon</a>!

Everything adds up to make for an amazing experience for everyone!</p> 
                <p>How does a relatively small regional convention such as SkålCon grow to get national, even international, attention? With a little help from our friends. Thurston Hillman, for one. He was instrumental in helping our convention get off the ground. His willingness to help in a myriad of ways, regardless of what it was we asked him to do, went a long way in ensuring we could put on our little convention the following years. Thurston also helped spread the word about our community’s dedication to the idea of SkålCon. Every year, I meet more and more people, most of whom I had never met before, who ask me when SkålCon is and if they can volunteer. Why? Because Thursty, that’s why.</p> 
                <p>While every convention is different, so our experience will be different than yours, Paizo event support is consistant. They have the ability to help you promote your convention. work with you to find the appropriate level of support for your convention, be it one that seats 15 or 150 tables over a weekend, and ask “How can we help make your convention better?” Most of the Org Play team has a Venture Corps background and were once doing what you are planning to do, so they understand the challenges of hosting an event. Paizo is in a position to give you the right level of support no matter what size convention you are running, and we encourage you to use them as a resource.</p> 
                <p>What do we do with the collected donations? We give them to Tubman, which helps women, men, youth and families throughout the Twin Cities who have experienced relationship violence, elder abuse, addiction, sexual exploitation or other forms of trauma. You can learn more about their mission at <a href="http://www.tubman.org">www.tubman.org</a>.</p> 
                <p>Finally, I want to share a few words from Tubman’s Director of Communications, Emily Truscott:</p> 
                <p>“Since 2015, SkålCon participants and organizers have contributed nearly $20,000 and countless diapers, food items, clothing, and toiletries to support the people who need Tubman’s services. People come to Tubman due to domestic violence, sexual assault, addiction, and many other situations, and the support from the community means so much—not only in the tangible necessities, but because it sends a message to our clients that people care about them. Knowing that the community is supporting them while they go through these life-changing situations can make a huge impact on someone’s life. All of us at Tubman are grateful for the SkålCon community and what they’ve done for people at Tubman.”</p> 
                <p>SkålCon is September 20-22 2019 at Crowne Plaza Minneapolis West and we invite you to join us! Our website <a href="http://www.skalcon.org">http://www.skalcon.org</a> has all the information you need to attend.</p>

But there are plenty of more worldly foes, too. In Starfinder, even seemingly innocuous things can become deadly, such as the ferromagnetic ooze, seen here engulfing our unfortunate mechanic, Quig, as his trusty drone, Scout, attempts to give him a lift without getting pulled in too.</p>

                <p>But it’s not all bad news for adventurers! <i>Alien Archive 3</i> includes 19 new playable species, including dessamars, who have a larval and an adult form, complete with different statistics and abilities. Pictured here is a raxilite, a capital-T Tiny plant creature that uses its LFAN (Lifting Floret Activiation Network) to deftly handle items designed for larger creatures.</p>

                <p>Of course, we crammed a lot of other player options into this book too; over 50 new options include armor, weapons, starship systems, augmentations, spells, and a whole lot more. Since we mentioned the ferrofluid ooze, check out this armor upgrade based on its vibration-dampening properties:</p>

                </div> 
                <p>Perhaps the most exciting player option we introduced in <i>Alien Archive 3</i> is our new creature companion system! Now you can have a pet, a battle buddy, or even a mount. We included premade companions for you to choose from, such as tashtari (also known as laser wolf) pups, serpentine mounts, and curious shape-changing oozes. A simple series of feats lets you exert increasing control over your companion, letting you choose how deeply to develop your bond.</p>

                <p itemprop="description">Over the last few weeks, we’ve looked at a number of monsters featured in the upcoming <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01ztb?Pathfinder-Battles-Legendary-Adventures">Pathfinder Battles: Legendary Adventures</a> set of pre-painted plastic miniatures from our partners at WizKids, but we haven’t yet jumped into the many player-character options the set supports. Luckily, when we were gearing up for the launch of Pathfinder Second Edition, we asked iconic Pathfinder artist Wayne Reynolds to produce some concept art of what the various ancestries of the game would look like if designed from the ground up. This resulted in some slight changes in proportions among halflings and dwarves, for example, that we wanted to make sure were reflected in the earliest set released after Second Edition’s launch.</p> 
                <p>First, let’s look at dwarves! The set features three dwarves to cover a variety of character rolls: the uncommon Dwarf Champion and Dwarf Rogue and the rare Dwarf Sorcerer. These figures can, respectively, easily double for a Toragdan cleric or fighter, a knife-wielding monk or spellcaster, and a bard, cleric, or wizard.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/081919_Dwarf_Champion.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/081919_Dwarf_Champion_360.jpeg" alt="A heavily armored Dwarf Champion wields an axe in his right hand."></a> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/081919_Dwarf_Rogue.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/081919_Dwarf_Rogue_360.jpeg" alt="A Dwarf Rogue brandishes a fist dagger in her right hand."></a> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/081919_Dwarf_Sorcerer.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/081919_Dwarf_Sorcerer_360.jpeg" alt="A white-haired Dwarf Sorcerer confidently wields a staff on her right hand, purple magic swirling around her."></a> 
                </div> 
                <p>Next alphabetically we have elves, whose first figure in the set appeared in the Legendary Adventures Preview Pack earlier this month. A variant version of the same sculpt is included in the full set as a common figure we showed off two weeks ago. The second elf in the series is actually two different figures based on the same mold, one wielding two swords and the other drawing a bow. Elf Ranger is a Medium uncommon figure with an a/b designation to its collector’s number.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/081919_Elf_Ranger_1.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/081919_Elf_Ranger_1_500.jpeg" alt="A sword-wielding Elven Ranger stalks his prey."></a> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/081919_Elf_Ranger_Bow.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/081919_Elf_Ranger_Bow_500.jpeg" alt="A bow-wielding Elven Ranger stalks his prey."></a> 
                </div> 
                <p>Gnext come the gnomes! Legendary Adventures features two gnomes, both Small: the common Gnome Rogue and rare Gnome Fighter. The rogue can double as just about any lightly-armored gnome character, though her brightly colored hair and outfit might make her stand out a bit. The polearm-wielding fighter can likewise serve as a champion or barbarian, so long as you’re fine with his colorful and mismatched armor.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/081919_Gnome_Rogue.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/081919_Gnome_Rogue_500.jpeg" alt="A dagger-wielding Gnome Rogue in a colorful traveling outfit with a number of staves crossed on her back."></a> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/081919_Gnome_Soldier.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/081919_Gnome_Soldier_500.jpeg" alt="A heavily armored Gnome Soldier with a green beard and eyebrows stands at attention, halberd at the ready."></a> 
                </div> 
                <p>Ever in the shadow of their taller kin, halflings round out the PC options in today’s preview. The Preview Pack included the Halfling Slinger, whose alternative paint scheme we showed off previously, but we’ve also got two rare halflings in the set that I believe are the coolest halfling minis ever produced. The Halfling Druid exhibits the multifunctional nature of many halfling items with her staff holding a teapot that also probably has magic spell components or healing herbs in it. Meanwhile, the aged Halfling Wizard makes up for his diminutive size with a stern look and a fiery spell effect.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/081919_Halfling_Druid.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/081919_Halfling_Druid_500.jpeg" alt="A Halfling Druid wields a staff in her left hand and a translucent blue shield in her right."></a> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/081919_Halfling_Wizard.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/081919_Halfling_Wizard_500.jpeg" alt="A bald-headed Halfling Wizard with bushy sideburns scowls over his eyeglasses as he raises a glowing yellow gem in his right hand."></a> 
                </div> 
                <p>Not all roughly human-shaped figures in the set are appropriate for PCs, or even restricted to Medium or Small sizes. The Ashen Man, for example, who first appeared in the Pathfinder Playtest adventure Doomsday Dawn, has the potential to be a recurring villain in the Age of Lost Omens, and his plans and influence extend far beyond the constraints of that module. A Large rare figure, the mysterious foe can stand in for any enlarged spellcaster or mist-shrouded undead.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/081919_Ashen_Man.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/081919_Ashen_Man_500.jpeg" alt="A faceless, robed humanoid figure, gray ash pouring from his sleeves and cowl, wields a staff covered with spidery red veins and capped with what appears to be a human heart."></a> 
                </div> 
                <p>But why stop at Large figures when the Legendary Adventures set allows the chance to do some of the Huge giants we’ve been unable to produce in plastic form thus far? Check out the Storm Giant and both versions of the Cloud Giant (all Huge uncommon figures) to complete your core Bestiary giant collection!</p>

                </div> 
                <p>Next week we’ll wrap up our previews of Legendary Adventures with a look at the remaining beasties lurking in the shadows, sure to challenge player characters everywhere!</p>

               <blockquote> 
                <p>If you are new to our work, for the past several years the Order has been completing projects for the Paizo blog. Our most recent work, The Azlant Odyssey, started in 2017—paused to complete the <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgfm?Order-of-the-Amber-DieDoomsday-Dawn-Playtest">Pathfinder Playtest</a>—and is now nearing its conclusion with volumes five and six of the Ruins of Azlant Adventure Path! For those looking to refresh themselves on the campaign, here are the first four parts:</p> 
                <p>The Azlant Odyssey <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkc1?Order-of-the-Amber-DieThe-Azlant-Odyssey-Part-1">Part 1</a>, <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkfm?Order-of-the-Amber-DieThe-Azlant-Odyssey-Part-2">Part 2</a>, <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo5lksq?Order-of-the-Amber-DieThe-Azlant-Odyssey-Part-3">Part 3</a>, and <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkyn?Order-of-the-Amber-DieThe-Azlant-Odyssey-Part-4">Part 4</a>.</p> 
                <p>We have been to the semi-finals of an Adventure Path plenty of times before, but what worried our party about part five of this particular AP was what we knew about our goal. The information we gathered told us that inside the Alabaster Trident, a massive tower built during the age of thriving Azlant, resided a lich who had spent the last few 10,000 years creating a legion of undead abominations. In our chase to stop a veiled master from securing a weapon of catastrophic power, we had to go to the Alabaster Trident and seek out this lich. The tower sank along with Azlant; therefore, we expected to face many levels of undead in a submerged dungeon-crawl, and there was no guarantee we would find air within. There wasn't a single one of us that didn't fear ending up like the lich's name, "Auberon the Drowned."</p> 
                <p>This marathon also carried with it some out-of-game emphasis for us, as it would mark our 150th published adventure completed since the founding of the Order in 1987. With such an occasion on hand, we'd have a full house with extra live-NPCs throughout. Our talented rookie, Robert Pontious, flew in from Rhode Island with his hair and beard dyed grey to match his role as Ezren. Author and <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo5ldj9?Meet-the-Intern-Savannah">former Paizo intern Savannah Broadway</a> arrived from Seattle to attend her first marathon since <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo5lk5x?Order-of-the-Amber-DieThe-Strange-Aeons">The Strange Aeons Experiment</a>; she would take the role of Aoinse, an awakened clockwork servant of Amaznen.</p> 
                <p>To add to the immersion of this multi-day dive into a submerged tower, our GM turned down the air-conditioning to a cool 63 degrees, and we kept the lights low in the areas that were not lit. Most significantly though, the master craftsmanship of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BlackBardStudios">Black Bard Studios</a> took this marathon to new heights, by creating an entire scale model of the Alabaster Trident that stood about 8 feet high! Room-for-room and level-for-level, it was an accurate 3D model which allowed us to perfectly experience this adventure's spatial challenges. Further, as we explored the tower throughout the course of the marathon, we removed each level and kept it on display as a constant reminder of the architectural layout of the tower.</p>

                 <li><b>Adventure</b>: <i>Pathfinder Adventure Path #125: Tower of the Drowned Dead</i></li> 
                 <li><b>Marathon Length</b>: 80 hours, 5min</li>

                </ul> 
                <h2>Highlights From "Tower of the Drowned Dead"</h2> 
                <ul> 
                 <li>We faced plenty of clockworks in the tower, even a nightmarish gargantuan clockwork infused with the soul of a kraken—and there was no way in the nine layers of Hell we were fighting it. Instead, we scouted the level and brought down the wall closest to the stairway it was guarding. We just needed Valeros (an aquanaut) and Koloshkora (locathah ranger) to go base-to-base with it for a couple of rounds while the rest of us swam past. No worries though, we had aquatic life insurance in the form of <i>freedom of movement</i>.</li> 
                 <li>Beneath the Alabaster Trident was a level known as the "Vaults," a secluded place of horror and torture. The master of the Vaults, an aboleth nosferatu sorcerer, calmly explained that it must destroy our party to save us from an undead fate similar to itself. A round-one <i>sunbeam</i> from Kyra ended the fight in twelve seconds—lights out.</li> 
                 <li>Keen senses were vital when trying to stay one step ahead of Auberon, who knew early on that we were inside his home. Our Player Captain, Matt Hardin, managed to get Koloshkora to touch a 68 Perception at just 12th level. Mark it down.</li> 
                 <li>If you thought the author would keep you in one place the whole time, welcome to the Omen Dominion: a timeless demiplane that predated even the Alabaster Trident. We went from spending forty-five session hours underwater, to being surrounded by the lively sounds of a forest. It was here that we got to choose the ending we wanted and decided to engage in our first-ever negotiations with a lich.</li> 
                </ul>

                <h2>The Odyssey</h2> 
                <p>Handling the challenges involved with submerged dungeon-crawling was definitely one of the tougher experiences we've faced as adventurers over the decades. This is OAD though, and we were ready for it with a strong playbook and spell stack: <i>slipstream</i>, <i>life bubble</i>, <i>ride the waves</i>, and <i>greater longstrider</i> were key factors in our win. Actually, between our <i>apparatus</i> of the crab and an Elven <i>folding boat</i> we came across (which we boldly rechristened as the <i>Even Deeper</i>), we're traversing ancient Azlant in style!</p> 
                <h2>Character Deaths</h2> 
                <ul> 
                 <li>Author Ron Lundeen is no stranger to putting our characters down. Heck, in our playthrough of <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo5ljda?Order-of-the-Amber-DieThe-Strange-Aeons">Dreams of the Yellow King</a>, Ron's animate dream killed one of his own prominent NPCs. He's always fair though. This time a banshee wailed and Ezren missed his save.</li> 
                 <li>It's quite possible that no creature strikes more fear into the hearts of Order members than a shining child. Apparently, an aquatic shining child does exist, and it's called a pelagic child. They are sometimes encountered in pairs, or even two pairs as happened in this adventure. It didn't take long for the Amber Die to deliver a critical hit with a <i>searing ray</i>, which removed Aoinse from our roster. Adam Daigle bears some responsibility for the cruelty of pelagic children as well, so the author and managing developer could kindly apologize to our party (and Mikko Kallio) for permanently destroying our beloved clockwork priestess.</li>

                <h2>Current Situation</h2> 
                <p>We cut a deal with Auberon for information, and now we're headed back to the undersea city of Talasantri to drop off the daughter of one of our merfolk friends. After that, we'll check on the colony of Talmandor's Bounty for a quick resupply and to make sure things are in good shape before we head to the location of a secret Azlanti facility called the Compass. We learned that this facility stores several (yes, several) doomsday devices, and we expect it to be at least partially underwater. Our equipment is solid, our spell selections are on point, and party coherency is at its peak. Yeah, let's get a little cockier than we were in the previous blog: This is the best position we've had when staring down the final volume of any Adventure Path. Veiled masters, you're not in control anymore.</p>

                <p> At least, that's always been the theory. In practice, many of these disparate cultures haven't gotten the setting support they deserved. That's why when we set out to decide on the topic for the second of our new World Guides, Luis Loza quickly suggested a book that outlined the people of Golarion, especially those not well-covered in the Core Rulebook. In the <em>Lost Omens Character Guide</em>, we provide the information and mechanics to allow our players to create character concepts from all over the world. Just as importantly, we also sought to provide a more focused vision of what these people looked like! </p> 
                <p> The <em>Lost Omens Character Guide</em> makes heavy use of a rules concept introduced to the Rarity system in the Lost Omens World Guide: Access. Many of the ancestry feats in this book have a specific basis in the distinct traditions of various cultures and ethnicities, and as such, are listed as Uncommon rules options. The Access entry on these feats lists the criteria that allow a character to gain automatic access to a rules element. For example, the Erutaki people have a tradition of creating magical scrimshaw constructs; an Erutaki PC that meets the prerequisites can gain immediate access to the feat that represents that ability below, while another PC would have to learn the skill from an Erutaki carver or otherwise gain GM permission to take the feat. </p>

Prerequisites: You have a spellcasting class feature with the divine or primal tradition 
Access Erutaki ethnicity.
You know the truth behind old stories that tell of sending a fetish of bone and sinew to seek vengeance. These old magics allow you to conjure constructs with ease. Add the summon construct spell to your spell list. The constructs you summon have a distinct ivory scrimshaw appearance, and if you include a drop of blood, lock of hair, or other portion of a creature's body as part of the spell's material component, the summoned construct gains a +4 status bonus to Perception checks to sense or locate that creature.

                <p> That's not to say there aren't a few ancestry feats that are entirely dependent on heritage. For example, those of Nidalese ancestry can find the blessings of Zon-Kuthon manifesting as they grow stronger, granting the ability to see in darkness and other shadowy powers. Since these feats come as a direct result of Zon-Kuthon's pact with the people of Nidal, only Nidalese characters can take them—while a PC could try to gain access to such feats by seeking out Zon-Kuthon himself, as the three Kellid horselords that founded Nidal once did, such a bargain would likely have far more dramatic results than a few extra human ancestry feats. </p>

                <p> Inside the <em>Lost Omens Character Guide</em>, you'll find more heritages and ancestry feats for each of the Core ancestries that help to support a variety of ethnicities, both new and old. For instance, we've mentioned the mountain-dwelling Mbe'ke tribe of dwarves that live in the Mwangi Expanse in passing—we've now provided a new dwarven heritage to grant those dwarves an affinity with the dragons that they worship, but can also be used to represent dwarves with a connection to azers, the fiery god Angradd, or other elemental forces! </p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190816-elemental_heart_dwarf.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190816-elemental_heart_dwarf_500.jpeg" alt="ELEMENTAL HEART DWARF
Whether through a connection to Torag's forge, the azers of the Plane of Fire, or another source, you can exude a burst of energy. Mbe'ke and Taralu dwarves of the Mwangi Expanse believe this heritage is a gift from dragons or elemental spirits. Choose one of the following damage types: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. Once chosen, this can't be changed. You gain the Energy Emanation activity.
ENERGY EMANATION [two-actions]
Evocation, Primal
Frequency once per day
Energy bursts forth from your body. You deal 1d6 damage of your chosen type to all adjacent creatures (basic Reflex save using your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher). At 3rd level, and every 2 levels thereafter, this damage increases by 1d6. "></a>

                <p> In addition to new ethnicities, the <em>Lost Omens Character Guide</em> offers a more detailed look at some familiar cultures within the setting. For instance, inside this book lies the true name of the Snowcaster elves, as well as a number of secrets about their true origins. Of course, this knowledge only raises more questions, such as whether the events that created the modern-day culture of the Snowcasters are also connected to a peculiar oddity of the elven goddess Findeladlara. As an aside, the Snowcasters have always had a distinct look, but when ordering art for the <em>Lost Omens Character Guide</em>, I asked for a specific addition to their silhouette—a pair of antler-like blades that the elves can quickly combine with other gear to transform into skis or a sled. These allow the Snowcasters to move rapidly over snow and ice, and also makes them somewhat intimidating at a distance, which might explain why many outsiders claim Snowcaster elves are demon-worshipping cannibals. </p> 
                <p> To those of you who love multiclassing, there is also a new elven heritage available to any elf of a certain age that might be of interest: </p>

In your long life, you've dabbled in many paths and many styles. Choose a class other than your own. You gain the multiclass dedication feat for that class, even though you don't meet its level prerequisite. You must still meet its other prerequisites to gain the feat.

                <p> With gnomes, we're taking the opportunity to emphasize that not all ancestries view ethnicity in the same way as humans do. Gnomes especially tend to possess a riot of unusual hair, eye, and skin colors that can often seem disconnected from genetics entirely. When gnomes speak of their ethnicities, they are usually referring to a natural affinity toward different kinds of magic that a gnome might possess—due to their souls' abrupt disconnect from their ancestral home in the First World, gnomes are more affected by nearby sources of magic when they are growing up. For example, gnomes who grow up near sources of divine power have more affinity with magic that changes reality or creates figments, while the unsettling fell gnomes have a stronger connection to occult magic or dark fey. </p> 
                <p> While goblins often receive little distinction from adventurers beyond what color splatter they leave behind, the recent slowing of humanoid/goblin aggressions has allowed the differences between goblin cultures to become better understood. The forest goblins of the Chitterwood lived through the Goblinblood Wars (more accurately, many of them did not live), which has given them a different approach to life when compared to the wilder goblins of Varisia. A relatively quick goblin lifespan and a traditional worship of Lamashtu means that goblins can also adapt to new environments very quickly, leading to some startling physiological differences between certain goblin ethnicities. The frost goblins of the north have blue skin and occasionally blue fur, but the most striking ethnicity of goblin is likely the monkey goblin, which possesses a long tail! A heritage for monkey goblins is provided for those who wish to play these unusual offshoots: </p>

You have a powerful tail, likely because you descend from a community of monkey goblins. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Athletics checks to Climb, you gain Combat Climber as a bonus feat, and you reduce the number of free hands required to Climb or Trip by one."></a>

                <p> Finally, we have halfling ethnicities, including a number of new cultural groups that don't simply copy the traditions of the taller humans around them. I'll leave most of them for those who pick up the book, but I'd be remiss not to mention Luis Loza's favorite of the bunch: the Othoban halflings, who he fondly refers to as "Time Halflings." What are time halflings? The answer involves the city of Xin-Edasseril and the events of the Return of the Runelords adventure path—after all, you didn't think there were only humans in that city, did you? </p> 
                <p> Tune in next week when we'll be here to talk about some of the new ancestries that will be appearing in the <em>Lost Omens Character Guide</em>! </p>

               <blockquote> 
                <p itemprop="description">Iseph crept through the empty museum, footsteps soundless on the tiled floor. All around the android, monsters loomed—alien creatures propped up in glass-walled display cases, their exhibits pumped full of inert gas to prevent the corpses' decay. In the dim emergency lighting, some of them almost looked alive. But of course that wasn't how places like this worked. </p> 
                <p> Iseph paused at the entrance to their destination. Pulling the tube from their belt, they blew a soft puff of dust through the doorway. </p> 
                <p> Laser lit up red, crisscrossing the small room. Iseph made a mental map of their locations, burning them into short-term memory even as the dust drifted to the floor and they disappeared again. </p> 
                <p> Bending low, Iseph slithered beneath the first laser, then arched high over the second. Of course, the android's cloaking field could bend lasers without breaking them, the same way it was currently foiling the thermal imaging cameras, and would have beaten the visual spectrum cameras if Iseph hadn't already hacked them to loop the footage. But Iseph had a certain level of professional pride, and laser tripwires were novice stuff—the sort of thing you put in because it looked impressive to clients, not because it deterred professionals. Dancing around them was so easy it was almost insulting. But of course the museum's security couldn't have known whom they'd be dealing with. </p>

                </div> 
                <p> The crystal stood alone atop a display pedestal, glowing softly. Inside its cylindrical viewing case, it balanced incongruously on a single metal point, its lower half an elaborate setting of wires and circuitry. </p> 
                <p> Rerouting the arcano-electric security seal on the case itself was more of a challenge, but still too easy for someone of Iseph's skill. The android added the appropriate relays, synched them, and popped the case free. </p> 
                <p> With nothing left between Iseph and the crystal, the android considered the pedestal's pressure sensor. It was a classic mechanism—the sort of thing you saw everywhere from ancient temples to modern bank vaults—yet still remarkably difficult to deal with. The era when you could just swap in a similarly sized rock as you snatched away the treasure was long gone, if it had ever truly existed. </p> 
                <p> Iseph knew the right tool for the job—a specialized lifter-and-pump mechanism that you anchored outside the pressure sensor, then attached to your target. The pump drew up liquid from a reservoir in the anchor, inflating a sack atop the sensor at the exact same rate as the crane arm lifted the prize free, making sure the weight remained constant. But it was expensive, and by necessity single-use. Iseph couldn't be expected to have one on hand. </p> 
                <p> It was a perfectly reasonable test to fail, yet something about it stuck in Iseph's craw. It was just so pedestrian. If— </p> 
                <p> A glint at the crystal's base caught their eye. There—a single metal flake, its color slightly off from its surroundings. </p> 
                <p> Iseph smiled. A magnetic proximity alarm. Electromagnetic sensors inside the pedestal would be calibrated to the alloy of that tag, sensing its exact composition and distance. Move it, and you'd disrupt the invisible magnetic fields and trigger the alarm. </p> 
                <p> And Iseph almost hadn't seen it. Here, at last, was some quality security work. Getting past it would require time and finesse. </p> 
                <p> Iseph snatched the crystal off its pedestal. </p> 
                <p> Alarms blared, accompanied by the clangs of security gates slamming down across exits throughout the museum. Iseph dropped their cloaking field, briefly considered waving to the thermal cameras, then sprinted back through the exhibits. </p> 
                <p> Security guards came rushing through the main entrance just as Iseph neared it—two humans, a ysoki, and a full half-dozen humanoid security bots, all positioned between the android and the exit. They didn't even give a warning, just opened fire with arc emitters and pulsecasters, the air humming and crackling with electricity. </p> 
                <p> Well, that isn't very professional. Iseph dove for shelter behind an exhibit featuring some sort of star-nosed lizard. The android drew their own pistol and leaned out to return fire, winging one of the humans. </p> 
                <p> It was tempting to keep firing—to show them all just who they were dealing with. But nine was probably too many, even for Iseph, and besides, the android had promised: only enough combat to sell it. Which meant it was time for the hard part. </p> 
                <p> This is going to hurt. Wincing in anticipation, Iseph slipped the crystal into an armored pouch, then stood and darted around the corner, straight for one of the patrol bots. </p> 
                <p> The blast caught Iseph full in the chest, sending them sprawling as electricity overloaded circuits and set muscles twitching. Someone kicked the gun from Iseph's hand, and then the android was staring up at a circle of angry faces and mirrored robotic lenses. </p> 
                <p> The human Iseph had shot clutched at his injured shoulder. “An android?” he snarled. “I'd have thought one of you half-bots would be too smart to try stealing from the Galactic Heritage Foundation.” He patted Iseph down roughly, eyebrows rising as he pulled the crystal from its case. “The Songstone! You've got a good eye, for a thief.” </p> 
                <p> “I'm not the thief here.” Iseph pointed at the Songstone. “That crystal stores the psychic memories of the Parelnesi tribes going back a thousand generations—their whole culture is in there! It doesn't belong in a museum.” </p> 
                <p> “That's exactly why it belongs in a museum,” the guard snapped. “That kind of history is too valuable to leave on some backwater world. Besides, they obviously couldn't protect it.” </p> 
                <p> “No,” Iseph acknowledged with a nod. “But they could hire somebody to get it back.” </p> 
                <p> The guard smirked. “And look how well that went.” </p> 
                <p> Iseph matched his smile. “I don't know, I think it's going pretty well.” </p> 
                <p> The ysoki guard wrinkled her snout. “How do you figure?” </p> 
                <p> As if on cue, the six security bots swiveled in unison, pointing their weapons at the guards. </p> 
                <p> Over the museum's intercom, a familiar voice said, “Weapons down, please.” </p> 
                <p> “What?” The lead guard gaped, pistol hanging loose as he stared down the barrels of his robots' arc emitters. </p> 
                <p> “You didn't really think I tripped your alarm by accident, did you?” Iseph stood, shaking out the last pins and needles of the stun bolt. The android reached out and plucked the crystal from the guard's grip. “I just needed to lure you all away from the security station long enough for the others to get in there and work their magic.” </p> 
                <p> The intercom clicked on once more, ringing with Raia's smooth tones. </p> 
                <p> “The museum is now closed,” she announced. “All jewel thieves, please proceed to the nearest exit...” </p>

                <p itemprop="description">This week, the Starfinder Society team previews upcoming plans for the campaign. Given that we’re getting well underway with our second season of play, it’s time to talk about something that’s been on everyone’s mind: what’s happening with our First Seeker? </p> 
                <p> Since the beginning of the Year of Scoured Stars, Luwazi Elsebo has led the Society, tirelessly working to maintain the organization. With the climactic conclusion of the Scoured Stars storyline in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01zn5"><em>Starfinder Society #2-00: Fate of the Scoured God</em></a>, Luwazi declared her intentions on stepping down from leadership. Having accomplished the mission of keeping the Society together and stopping the threat from the Scoured Stars, she completed her First Seeker mandate. Recognizing the need for a proper transition of leadership, Luwazi will oversee the election to get a new First Seeker, then retire. </p> 
                <p> This is where all of you come in. </p> 
                <p> Arriving at the end of September, <em>Starfinder Society #2-07: Four for the First</em>, is a new scenario that’s set to introduce us to the four candidates vying for First Seeker. These candidates aren’t just random NPCs, but are characters who have been selected from among members of our campaign—<a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgkh?April-Update-Second-Seekers-Novas-Spotlights">we told you</a> that Second Seekers boon would be important! This scenario sets the stage for allowing our campaign members to vote on their desired choice for the Society’s future leader. Since Four for the First is so important, we wanted to make sure we got the word out well in advance, so everyone has time to prepare. Now, let’s go over some of the key dates. </p> 
                <p> </p>
                <ul> 
                 <li> <strong>September 20th</strong> - we’ll be doing our normal scenario preview blogs that highlights Four for the First and the other monthly release. This blog will include a non-active link to a survey page. </li> 
                 <li> <strong>September 25th</strong> - Starfinder Society #2-07: Four for the First releases to the public. At the same time, the associated survey page goes live. Players from across the world can vote on their preferred candidate, helping shape the future of the Starfinder Society campaign! </li> 
                 <li> <strong>November 19th at 11:59 PST</strong> - the survey closes. This gives our community two full months to play Starfinder Society #2-07: Four for the First and vote for one of the First Seeker candidates. </li> 
                 <li> Sometime in early 2020, we’ll reveal the results of the vote, which will help to shape the direction of Starfinder Society’s third year of play, scheduled for launch at Origins Game Faire June 17th 2020. </li> 
                </ul> 
                <p></p> 
                <p> Exciting times ahead! </p> 
                <p> Just as we’ve revealed some information now to make organizers lives much easier, the team would also like to take an opportunity to discuss some key points about <em>Four for the First</em>. </p> 
                <p> </p>
                <ul> 
                 <li> This scenario is structured much like a quest pack, where the PCs get to perform a mission of importance to each of the First Seeker candidates. </li> 
                 <li> Since so much of this scenario involves the PCs getting to know specific candidates and the types of missions to expect from them, this scenario somewhat eases the restrictions on run time. If you want to play this scenario over two sessions to make sure none of the interactions feel rushed, please do so. </li> 
                 <li> Because we want players to get to know the candidates, and understand that may take multiple play-throughs, <em>Four for the First</em> will be a repeatable scenario. </li> 
                 <li> Though players may experience the scenario multiple times, only one vote per player counts. </li> 
                </ul> 
                <p></p> 
                <p> Ok, so that’s a lot of information, but we really wanted to get it out there as soon as possible. We look forward to the upcoming release of <em>Four for the First</em> because it’s really going to take the living aspect of the Starfinder Society to the next level. </p> 
                <p> Until next time,</p>

                <p>We decided on an online version after reviewing the feedback from our guide survey last fall. Actually, most of the changes we made came from that survey. Going online allows for quick updates, instead of waiting until the launch of a new Year. This flexibility means a player no longer has to search through blog posts and multiple documents to determine character legality. It also means we can adjust our new campaign based on player feedback, especially important as we settle into the new edition. </p> 
                <p> Other guide highlights –<br> • Included a quick start guide<br> • Revised organization<br> • Charts and examples for new processes<br> • Best practices more reflect how the community utilizes the program<br> • Renamed Additional Resources/Campaign Clarifications to Character Options </p> 
                <p>The current guide is an interim step, as the guide team looks at different platforms that will accomplish our goals. Some of our short-term desires include removing the alphabetical search function at the top that isn’t very functional, adding a means of downloading content as a pdf file. Based on user feedback, we also a method of printing and the inclusion of robust searching engine on our to-do list. </p> 
                <p>To aid users in tracking changes, we included a version history and changelog on the top of the main page. Please check back often and make sure you have the most up to date version.</p> 
                <p>As with all changes, we expect bumps and hiccups. We’ve opened a forum thread for guide commentary. Please add your feedback to <a href="https://paizo.com/threads/rzs42p8u?Feedback-PFS-Guide-to-Play#1">this thread</a>.</p> 
                <p>Come back later to hear what is in store for the Starfinder Society in regards to the Second Seekers. </p> 
                <p>Until next time – Explore, Report, Cooperate!</p>

                <p itemprop="description">Last week we started looking at the forthcoming Pathfinder Battles: Legendary Adventures set of pre-painted plastic miniatures from our partners at WizKids. This week we’ll explore the Goblin Village premium set that releases alongside the Huge booster-based set. </p> 
                <p>Longtime goblin fans will notice a lot of nods to past goblin adventures in this premium set. When we first started designing this set, I knew we needed to include iconic goblin elements from Pathfinder’s long history, and we plumbed not just our past adventures like <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy7zkr?Pathfinder-1-Rise-of-the-Runelords-Chapter-1-Burnt-Offerings">Burnt Offerings </a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy8j5w">We Be Goblins!</a>, but also the <a href="https://paizo.com/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics/goblins">“Goblins!”</a> comics from Dynamite Entertainment.</p> 
                <p>Included in the set are the following components:</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> 
                 <table width="50%"> 
                  <tbody>

                </div> 
                <p>With one Goblin Village premium set, a GM will get enough components to set up a full 360° palisade wall, large enough to hold most of the other components based on the needs of their campaign. That might be a series of tents and the tribe’s magic pig in its pen, or a clutch of goblin babies, ready to present adventurers with a moral quandary about what to do with these innocent balls of destruction. It might be a bonfire to honor the junk effigy worshiped by the superstitious tribe, or a war council overseen by the presiding chief. The possibilities are endless!</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter" style="padding-bottom: 25px;"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190812-village1.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190812-village1.jpg" alt="A closeup of a goblin village, focused on a large goblin tent with a gate across the opening." width="250"></a> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190812-village2.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190812-village2.jpg" alt="Three goblin tents sit inside a circular gated area.

A group of goblin babies stand nearby." width="250"></a> 
                </div> 
                <p>The Chief Goblin is presented in a sitting position and is removable from the throne, and is the same figure as the Goblin Chieftain (Small rare) in the main set.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter" style="padding-bottom: 25px;"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190812-goblin_chieftain.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190812-goblin_chieftain.jpg" alt="A goblin chieftain with both hands in the air. The left hand holds a mace with a skull on the end, spikes poking through the openings." width="250"></a> 
                </div> 
                <p>In addition to the goblin babies (unbased) and both versions of the goblin chief, Legendary Adventures also includes a number of goblinoid figures appropriate for both player characters and adversaries. The only goblin that has yet to be revealed is the goblin ankle-slasher (Small uncommon), as both the preview and standard versions of the goblin dog-slicer and goblin guard appeared in previous blogs, and we looked at the goblin horse-chopper “sculpt-share” last week.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter" style="padding-bottom: 25px;"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190812-goblin_ankle_slasher.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190812-goblin_ankle_slasher.jpg" alt="A goblin with weapons in each hand, ready to slash any ankles that make themselves available." width="250"></a> 
                </div> 
                <p>Goblins aren’t the only goblinoids in Legendary Adventures, though. Both hobgoblins and bugbears got conceptual makeovers by Wayne Reynolds during our early days of developing Pathfinder Second Edition, and we couldn’t pass up the opportunity to include some figures based on Wayne’s designs in this set. In this set, you will find the bugbear mauler (Medium common), hobgoblin sharpshooter (Medium common), hobgoblin commander (Medium rare), and bugbear butcher (Medium rare) as well as those goblinoids already released in the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01ztd?Pathfinder-Battles-Legendary-Adventures-Preview-Pack">Legendary Adventures Preview Pack</a>.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter" style="padding-bottom: 25px;"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190812-bugbear_mauler.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190812-bugbear_mauler.jpg" alt="A bugbear mauler, large rectangular shield in the left hand, right arm raised with a weapon similar to a glaive.

                </div> 
                <p>And while they’re not particularly thematically linked to the goblinoids of this blog, but because I’d be remiss not to show off a Large or Huge figure from the set at every opportunity, here are the pteranodon (Large uncommon) and boar demon (Huge rare).</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190812-pteranadon.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190812-pteranadon.jpg" alt="A large prehistoric-looking bird with a long face and beak, wings up as though flying." width="250"></a> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190812-boar-demon.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190812-boar-demon.jpg" alt="A huge demonic-looking boar, mouth open in a large grin." width="250"></a> 
                </div> 
                <p>Next week we’ll look at the many player character ancestries represented in this set and some of the giant foes the Huge booster format allows GMs to add to their games.</p>

                <p>My first Gen Con was exciting! Getting the chance to meet so many of you and share our love of gaming was an absolute blast. Now that the dust has settled, I'd like to take a look at what went down.</p> 
                <p> For those who missed being there, the crew over at <a href="http://knowdirectionpodcast.com/" target="_new">Know Direction</a> helped bring the show to you at home! Our <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/officialpaizo">Twitch</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/Paizoinc" target="_new">Youtube</a> channels will soon have all of the seminars and juicy revelations.

                <p> So many of you greeted us at the Paizo booth! When I was able to step out of the streaming room to stop by and visit, I saw tons of gamers enjoying Pathfinder and Starfinder. It was great to see them playing demos right next door to the booth. I want to thank the GM volunteers who helped show off the magic of Starfinder and Pathfinder! </p>

                </div> 
                <p> Upstairs in the Sagamore Ballroom, the Pathfinder, Starfinder, and Pathfinder Adventure Card Societies had amazing turnouts and hosted several awesome multi-table events! If you want to see some of us having fun with the NPC announcements, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3nzkR7X-R4" target="_new">I was allowed to do one of the voices here</a>. I got to talk to a fair amount of you in the ballroom and witness the fantastic community Organized Play brings to the table. I'm proud and thankful of all of our leaders and volunteers for making this Gen Con super exciting! </p>

                </div> 
                <p> Now for the announcements about future products! Of course, we talked about Pathfinder products that have already been revealed, like the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01y0o?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-World-Guide">Lost Omens World Guide</a>and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01zpx?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Character-Guide">Lost Omens Character Guide</a>. Then we unveiled the Pathfinder Bestiary Pawn Box, Pathfinder Weapon &amp; Armor Cards, Pathfinder Bestiary Battle Cards, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01zq7?Pathfinder-Gamemastery-Guide">Gamemastery Guide</a>, Bestiary 2, and Advanced Player's Guide. That last one will be a 256-page hardcover with four new classes (Investigator, Oracle, Swashbuckler, and Witch), ten ancestries and heritages (Aasimar, Catfolk, Changeling, Dhampir, Duskwalker, Kobold, Orc, Ratfolk, Tengu, and Tiefling), and tons of archetypes, general feats, spells, and magic items. The free public class playtest will drop in October! </p>

                <p></p> 
                <p> We also announced that the evolution of Golarion would focus on Absalom in the year to come. Here's the lineup: Lost Omens Gods &amp; Magic hardcover, the Extinction Curse Adventure Path set on Starstone Isle (Kortos), <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01zrc/discuss?Pathfinder-Adventure-The-Dead-Gods-Hand#1">The Dead God’s Hand</a> 128-page adventure will feature Aroden lore, the Absalom: City of Lost Omens hardcover and Poster Map Folio will set you up for the Agents of Edgewatch Adventure Path. This AP will be a "cops and robbers" story set in urban Absalom. </p>

                <p> On the other side of the Gap, our beloved Starfinder is going strong and exploring beyond the Pact Worlds! Of course, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01zof?Starfinder-Alien-Archive-3">Alien Archive 3</a> and the <a href="https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventurePath/attackOfTheSwarm">Attack of the Swarm Adventure Path</a> will both invade on August 28.

                <p></p> 
                <p> Starfinder products that should already be on your radar are the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01yef?Starfinder-Character-Operations-Manual">Character Operations Manual</a>, with three new classes, the <a href="https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventurePath/threefoldconspiracy">Threefold Conspiracy Adventure Path</a>, and the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01zpl?Starfinder-Deck-of-Many-Worlds">Deck of Many Worlds</a>. Did you catch that we have started Starfinder Iconic Encounter fiction here on paizo.com? </p>

                <p itemprop="description">“‘Fix the shuttle,’ she says. ‘It’s only a little banged up,’ she says.” Angry clanging noises came from beneath the deck, followed by Quig’s face popping up out of the engineering access bay. He waved a spanner angrily. “Next time Navasi wants to sign us up for a salvage mission, she can patch the junker, and <i>I’ll</i> stay on the <i>Maiden</i> and watch for pirates!”</p> 
                <p>Altronus stared down from the hallway, both sets of arms crossed. “I’m sure the captain was just expressing confidence in your abilities.”</p> 
                <p>“Yeah?” Grease-smeared ears twitched above Quig’s mask. “Well <i>I’m</i> sure that this rustbucket isn’t going anywhere without a miracle. I’ve wired together every battery we’ve got to charge the capacitors, but the reactor containment field is totally shot. If I fire it up without the magnetic bottle in place, they’ll be finding pieces of us all the way out on Aucturn.”</p> 
                <p>“Is there anything I can do to help?”</p> 
                <p>“Sure. You can tell our fearless leader that unless she wants to abandon our score to the rest of the jackals, we’re gonna remain stranded on a barren rock approximately three times the size of my furry brown ass, with no way to call in a tow because—<i>oh yeah</i>—this whole job is technically illegal.” The spanner made another wild circle, nearly clipping Altronus’s knee. “I swear by my grandmother’s tail, I—”</p> 
                <p>“Anything <i>else</i> I can do? To help with the repairs?”</p> 
                <p>Quig sighed and let the spanner droop. “Go outside and get a look at the right main thruster for me. Let me know if the nozzle housing looks intact.”</p> 
                <p>“Right.” Grateful for the chance to escape the ysoki’s incessant, undignified complaining, Altronus walked to the hatch and cycled the airlock.</p> 
                <p>The air beyond was thin, and bitterly cold. The sarcesian colonists who had once tried to make this asteroid habitable had long since abandoned the project, and Altronus’s lungs burned with strain and frost as he struggled to process what little air their machines had left behind.</p> 
                <p>Yet as it always did, the nearness to vacuum soothed him even as it stung. Out here, there was no barrier between him and the cosmos. The cold he felt was the same cold that wrapped the stars. The song of the Cycle hummed in his veins like background radiation.</p> 
                <p>He walked around to the back of the shuttle. From the outside, the damage looked worse—for all Altronus’s faith in the captain, he had to admit that Quig had a point. The fact that they were even close to getting the thing flying again was a testament to the ysoki’s skill. He reached up with his highhands and hauled himself easily up into the engine’s darkened mouth.</p> 
                <p>“Quig? Altronus?” Navasi’s voice crackled over coms. “Are you still at the shuttle?”</p> 
                <p>“Where else would we be?” Quig snapped. “Listen, Captain, this thing—”</p> 
                <p>“Stow it. Raia’s got life forms on scanners. Half a dozen of them, moving fast in your direction. Raia and I will intercept as many as we can with the <i>Maiden</i>, but some of them will reach you before we do.”</p> 
                <p>“Acknowledged, Captain.” Altronus turned and leapt down from the engine, his descent gruelingly slow in the meager gravity. “How much time do we have?”</p> 
                <p>But the answer was already coming over the crater’s rim: three round-shelled creatures, their front ends writhing masses of tentacles, two of which were longer than the others and heavily scaled. They skimmed along like antigrav speeders above the asteroid’s surface, their shells glimmering metallically in the light of Altronus’s mote. One instant they were at the ridge, and the next they were at the shuttle’s side—halfway between Altronus and the hatch.</p>

                </div> 
                <p>“Altronus!” Quig appeared in the open airlock. “Get in here!”</p> 
                <p>“Working on it,” Altronus muttered. Then he stepped forward, careful not to launch himself off the asteroid’s surface, and raised his voice. </p> 
                <p>“Greetings, friends.” He lifted all four hands in what he hoped was a universal sign of peace. Would tentacled creatures even recognize the gesture? Raia would probably know. “I mean you no harm. My name is Altronus Barasul Dovenayan, a kasatha of House—”</p> 
                <p>A distortion rippled across the creatures’ shells, blue lines that weren’t quite lightning tracing down their tentacles. </p> 
                <p>Altronus froze. “Easy, friends. I—”</p> 
                <p>The creatures <i>pulsed</i>.</p> 
                <p>Altronus flew forward, dragged off his feet by some invisible force. He landed in the dust and rolled, barely avoiding lashes from the closest creature’s main tentacles. He yanked his pistol free of its holster, but the creatures pulsed again. This time, the pull on his body was weak enough that he could brace against it, but the gun lurched from his hand, slapping against the side of the creature’s shell and sticking there like—</p> 
                <p><i>Of course</i>. Magnets! Now that he had the idea in his head, he could feel the variation in the pull—the force exerted on the metal components of his armor, but none on the plates themselves. If he squinted, he could see the lines of magnetic fields around the creatures, dust-like metallic fines from the asteroid’s surface forming a cloud that pulsed like breath. </p> 
                <p>Quig’s swearing flooded the coms. Altronus looked over and saw the ysoki splayed out across one of the creature’s shells, pinned to it by his junkyard of a spacesuit.</p> 
                <p>Beneath his scarf, Altronus smiled.</p> 
                <p>The creatures thought they’d disarmed him. They didn’t realize that the gun was just a tool. </p> 
                <p><i>Altronus</i> was the weapon.</p> 
                <p>He stilled his mind, letting the false divisions between him and the universe fall away. </p> 
                <p>He was not Altronus. He was not kasatha. He was matter: forged in the heart of a star, pulling and pulled by every atom in the cosmic dance. He was energy: uncreateable, undestroyable, a momentary configuration of an eternal process.</p> 
                <p>He was everything. He was nothing.</p> 
                <p>And he was going to <i>wipe the floor</i> with these worm-faced bastards.</p> 
                <p>He stretched his consciousness down, into the asteroid, finding the thread of its gravitational pull and strengthening it. This time, when the creatures pulsed, he stood firm, tethered to the rock’s surface. With his lowright hand, he reached up and grabbed his mote, feeling the white-hot stellar energy distending into its familiar blade.</p> 
                <p>There was a sharp pop, like an electrical arc, and something slammed into Altronus’s side, spinning him halfway around. He looked down at the metallic barb protruding from his armor, and had just enough time to think the word <i>harpoon</i> before the creature pulsed again. The force yanked him sideways, threatening to rip him in two as the creature’s magnetic tether competed with his own gravitational anchor.</p> 
                <p>Well, one of those he could control. He dropped the anchor, lurching through the air toward the barb-thrower, stellar blade extended. The sudden rush caught the creature off-guard, and alien eyes widened as the blade struck home. The creature thrashed, tentacles sliding across Altronus’s armor as he slid his glowing blade free and thrust again. And again. </p> 
                <p>The creature’s strange antigravity cut out, dropping them both to the ground. Before Altronus could regain his feet, new tentacles wrapped him up from behind, pinning his arms to his sides. </p> 
                <p>The thing’s grip was like industrial machinery, the coiled tentacles crushing. Trying hard to ignore creaking bones and empty lungs, Altronus cast his mind out to Mataras, the blazing sun at the heart of the Pact Worlds. Delving down into its flaming seas, he made his consciousness a conduit, and let the fire flow.</p> 
                <p>Flames burst from his body in all directions, a tiny supernova burning tentacles to ash. He spun, chest heaving as the pressure around it relented, and brought his blade up.</p> 
                <p>The creature lay flat against the ground, charred tentacles twitching spasmodically. Off to one side, Quig stood next to the corpse of his own attacker, yanking tools free from its shell.</p> 
                <p>Alien eyes rolled in terror as Altronus pinned his beast to the rock with one foot, placing the tip of his blade inches from its eye. </p> 
                <p>Altronus coughed. “Let’s try this again, friend. I mean you no harm. And you don’t mean me any harm either, do you?” He waggled the blade.</p> 
                <p>The creature stared up at him, but made no move to protest. It just lay there, its shell wrapped in softly pulsing lines of magnetic fields.</p> 
                <p><i>Magnetic fields</i>. Altronus turned to his companion. “Quig. Is the reactor’s magnetic containment still broken?”</p> 
                <p>“Yeah, why?”</p> 
                <p>Altronus stared down into the creature’s eyes.</p> 
                <p>“Because I’ve got a crazy idea.”</p>

                <h2>Team News</h2> 
                <p>As announced on Saturday night at Gen Con, the organized play team underwent some changes in personnel. After eight years on the team, lead developer John Compton is moving to the Starfinder team as a Senior Developer. With heartfelt thanks for all the energy and effort expended on org play, we wish him the best in his new role at Paizo. As he departs, we experience a smooth transition, as developer Linda Zayas-Palmer steps into the organized play lead developer role. She brings six years of org play experience, as well as several more as a volunteer coordinator for Pathfinder Society, to the role and we are excited to see her influence on our storylines and scenarios. Both Michael Sayre and Thurston Hillman remain part of the organized play team. In the next few weeks, we will be working with Pathfinder Society managing developer Adam Daigle to evaluate further team needs.</p> 
                <h2>Organized Play Foundation News</h2> 
                <p>A few pieces of business as it relates to our relationship with the Organized Play Foundation (OPF) and volunteers.</p> 
                <p>First, we’ve moved the Pathfinder Society (2nd edition) Guide to Play to the Organized Play Foundation website. The direct link is <a href="http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/paizo/guides/">http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/paizo/guides/</a>. At present, it is online only, but we are working on a version that is print to pdf. The surveys we did last fall indicated much of the playerbase wanted an online version. Being online also makes it a living document that we can update as needed, instead of once a year.</p> 
                <p>Which brings us to the second point. We have three OPF volunteers tackling special projects. I’d like to take a moment to introduce them to you and welcome them to their new positions.</p> 
                <p><b>Jared Thaler</b> – responsible for the OPF website and online guide. He is currently working on improving the guide for use at games and will be rolling it out shortly. The version on the website now is a temporary version to get the rules to the communities running Pathfinder (2nd edition). He will update the version # and date on the front page when changes are made, so check there first!</p> 
                <p><b>Barb Wilkins</b> – responsible for volunteer onboarding. She is working on reviewing current volunteer rosters and sending out new NDAs for signing. If you’ve been waiting for your appointment, there should be an end in sight.</p> 
                <p><b>Bob Jonquet</b> – responsible for Event Team coordination for Paizo-sponsored conventions (PAX Unplugged, PaizoCon, UK Games Expo, Origins, and Gen Con). He will work with the organizing committees of those events to ensure a consistent, positive experience for all volunteers and attendees.</p> 
                <p>Thank you to all three of them for stepping in and filling some gaps in our organizational structure. We hope that having some focused attention on these areas will resolve some of the issues over the past year.</p> 
                <h2>Redistricting the Regions </h2> 
                <p>With the launch of Pathfinder Society (2nd edition) we moved some regions around and appointed several new Regional Venture Coordinators. Check out the new list here: <a href="http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/encyclopedia/volunteer-coordinators/">http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/encyclopedia/volunteer-coordinators/</a></p> 
                <h2>Campaign Coins</h2> 
                <p>Gen Con gave us the opportunity to recognize several longstanding volunteers with Campaign Coins. While each recipient had individual qualifications for receiving the award, they all shared a love of their communities and a willingness to serve. I hope we created some stardust moments for these individuals. They all seemed shocked at the recognition and I caught a few of them still in the middle of their volunteer efforts in the Sagamore. </p> 
                <p>Please take a moment to thank the following community members for their efforts on behalf of our gaming community and congratulate them on receiving new Org Play numbers!</p>

                <h2>Stars</h2> 
                <p>Gen Con rang to the sound of games being played and a few 5-star and 5-nova evaluations as well. Over the past month, several GMs reached the summit of 5-star mountain. To achieve this milestone, GMs run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios, as well as run a game for a venture-captain. A conservative estimate of time needed to reach 5-stars is 650 hours! To the GMs listed below, thank you very much for the time and energy you spend running Pathfinder Society games! Three cheers on your achievement!</p> 
                <p>Andrew Harasty<br> Joe Bouchard<br> Matt Duval<br> Phil Lucas<br> Ivis Flanagan<br> Sean Duncan<br> Johanathan Kopp<br> Mark Taylor<br> Sam Pitcheralle<br> Matt Wrycraft </p> 
                <p>As we pivot on the release of Pathfinder Society (2nd edition), Pathfinder, we would like to reiterate that this is not the end of the road for the Society (1st edition) campaign. Just as scenarios still count for event support and players can still earn boons at events, games ran will still count towards star requirements. So, don't worry if you're not quite to your goals, there will still be time to reach for the stars.</p> 
                <h2>Novas &amp; Glyphs</h2> 
                <p>Several GMs completed 5-nova evaluations over the past month. The rubric is working as intended. It looks like we will have the tech updates in the next few weeks, so evaluators will be able to input the results. Until then, please email them to me at <a href="mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com">organizedplay@paizo.com</a> for compilation.</p> 
                <h2>Convention Listing</h2> 
                <p>We have organized play activities at quite a few conventions in the upcoming months, so if you want to get your game on, check out the list below! The list includes all the event support requests received to date. If you see one missing, ping the organizer and have them submit a request for support or have them email me at <a href="mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com">organizedplay@paizo.com</a> to discuss their event. All of the conventions on the list maintain some type of web presence, be it website, social media page, or Warhorn listing, so if you are interested in attending in either capacity, check out their websites or contact the local venture-officer for more information!</p>

                <p>Each of our team had a different favorite memory of Gen Con and I asked everyone to send me theirs. Unfortunately, Linda was out today and didn’t send one in, so we will have to include hers in a later blog. To keep this blog from growing too long, we’re putting them behind spoiler tags. Please take a moment to share our memories and experiences and consider adding yours to the comments. We hope to see you at a convention soon, where we can make these types of memories with you.</p>

                 <p>My favorites revolve around handing out campaign coins and spending time with the fabulous group of volunteers. These experiences bring me back, convention after convention, and Gen Con 2019 was no different. This year, it seemed like there were more smiles, more happy faces, more enjoyment of games then I had seen before. It is a joy to sit on the stage in the Sagamore and look out over the tables, watching everyone play. I noticed a change in our demographics this year. There were more female GMs, more youth players than ever before. This speaks to the welcoming nature of our communities and to those organizing games, thank you for making our hobby accessible to all.</p> 
                 <p>To everyone I met, for everyone I interacted with, to all those that played or GMed, thank you for supporting our programs and our games. I hope to see you soon! </p>

                 <p>2019 marks my 9th Gen Con representing Paizo and my 7th working for the company as an employee. In many ways, the show had all of the beloved touchstones I’ve come to expect, such as the tremendous multi-table interactive specials, the many appreciative fans, the on-the-ground problem-solving, the enthusiastic volunteers, the late-night discussions, the crush of eager customers on the opening day, the launch of new adventures (like <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01zna?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-100-Origin-of-the-Open-Road">Pathfinder Society Scenario #1-00: Origin of the Open Road</a>, whose debut I oversaw on Thursday night), and the opportunity to show off our products to all comers—including <a href="https://twitter.com/Archaeotagh/status/1158140210187788288?s=20">the last Starfinder Beginner Box sold just a minute before the dealers hall closed</a>. On the other hand, this convention was bittersweet, for just before traveling to Indianapolis <a href="https://paizo.com/threads/rzs42o8o?Changing-Positions-on-the-Organized-Play-Team">I had accepted a new position at Paizo: senior developer</a>. In that capacity, I’ll be consulting occasionally on organized play story arcs as needed, yet the majority of my energy will go toward Starfinder’s print products. Although we broke the news to various parties earlier at Gen Con, the formal announcement happened on Saturday night—fittingly as the last multi-table interactive event of Pathfinder Society in the first edition was kicking into gear.</p> 
                 <p>Organized play will always be special to me. It’s how I learned some of my best lessons in GMing (ask me about <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy8kae?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-304-The-Kortos-Envoy">The Kortos Envoy</a>). It’s where I’ve met some of my best friends and closest collaborators. It’s what’s helped launch the writing careers of dozens of talented authors for Paizo and beyond. And it will continue to be a passion of mine at the office, at the gaming table, and at many conventions I’ll attend going forward. Little exemplifies those feelings quite like Gen Con, which so lives up to its title: “Best Four Days in Gaming.” I’ll catch you at the next one!</p>

                 <p>Wow, GenCon 2019, what a year! I spent most of the convention working alongside Tonya in the Sagamore Ballroom, where I got to see thousands of players enjoying our many games. Every year, without fail, GenCon gives me the opportunity to speak with our GMs and players from across the world, and hear what their thoughts on our games. It’s a perfect chance to realize the impact of what we do here on the Organized Play Team and to get some valuable feedback to incorporate into future work. Thanks to everyone who stopped by, said hi, gave feedback, or told a fun story about their tables. As always, I’m looking forward to next year!</p>

                 <p>Let me just say: what an amazing GenCon! It was absolutely incredible to see the energy and excitement as thousands and thousands of people picked up the new edition, played the demos, participated in organized play up in the Sagamore Ballroom, and just generally had a blast playing the products we’ve all been working so hard on. There wasn’t a single of the convention that I didn’t enjoy, and I had so many opportunities to interact with many of the amazing members of our community.</p> 
                 <p>I want to take a moment to specifically thank the wonderful Org Play GMs who came out ready to give our players an enjoyable and memorable experience. It’s the GMs who go the extra mile to make their games fun and exciting, and to create positive memories and experiences, that really make GenCon such an awesome convention. It’s the folks who go above and beyond to keep players excited to sit at our tables that keep our community strong and vibrant.</p> 
                 <p>Word has probably gotten around by this point that this was John Compton’s last GenCon as a member of the organized play team. I want to thank John for all of the wisdom and guidance (not to mention countless hours and words!) that he’s shared with me and everyone who’s participated in the organized play program for the better part of the last decade. Best of luck in your new role with the Starfinder team John, I’m excited to see what you’ve got in store for us!</p>

                <p itemprop="description"><a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sght?Pathfinder-Battles-A-Huge-Announcement">Back in February</a>, we announced the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01ztb?Pathfinder-Battles-Legendary-Adventures">next set of Pathfinder Battles pre-painted plastic miniatures from our partners at WizKids—Legendary Adventures</a>—and showed off a handful of the figures in the set, including the Huge dragon turtle and some of the pieces of the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01ztc?Pathfinder-Battles-Legendary-Adventures-Goblin-Village-Set">Goblin Village premium set</a> releasing at the same time. </p> 
                <p>It’s been a while, but now that Pathfinder Second Edition is out and we’ve got a bit of time to catch our breath, it’s time to look at the rest of the set, which comes out in September.</p> 
                <p>Since we first announced that Legendary Adventures would include Huge miniatures, one of the figures we heard the most hope for was the aquatic alghollthu, whose meddling in the affairs of humans in ancient times had an incredibly devastating effect on the fate of Golarion. Well, I’m happy to report that the alghollthu is in fact in the set! With an uncommon rarity, this staple of tabletop fantasy is sure to make a splash in campaigns across the world.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190805-algholithu.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190805-algholithu_500.jpeg" alt="3d sculpt of an algholithu miniature: a green fish-like creature with red fins and 4 tentacles sprouting near its front. It has three red eyes lined up vertically in the front of its face."></a>
                </div> 
                <p>One of the challenges of assembling this set was that we knew it would be coming out after the release of Pathfinder Second Edition, but the production lead times meant that we had to have art references to WizKids long before the final art for the Core Rulebook and Bestiary were in from our many artists. Breaking from our normal operating procedures, we used concept art and character sketches—many of which came from none other than iconic Pathfinder artist Wayne Reynolds—to make many of the figures. Take, as an example, the kobold soldier, kobold scout, and kobold scalecaster figures below. While we showed off kobolds’ new look back in the spring with the formal announcement of the Pathfinder Bestiary, we worked with WizKids to sculpt and color these figures from black-and-white sketches from Wayne last summer. The trio of Small figures are common and uncommon in rarity and should combine to make a memorable warband of what are sure to be a new fan favorite ancestry.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190805-kobolds.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190805-kobolds.jpg" alt="3 kobold miniature figures. On the left, a red kobold holding a staff before him. The staff is pointed on both ends and looks deadly. In the center, a green kobold wields a large dagger in its left hand and a hand crossbow in its right.  On the right, a blue kobold appears to be a spellcaster, wielding a staff high in the air in his left hand while a blue 'glow' comes from his right." width="800"></a>
                </div> 
                <p>Kobolds aren’t the only draconic creatures in Legendary Adventures, though. Check out the Huge blue dragon, a rare figure who really dominates the battlefield with its size and intimidating features.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190805-bluedragon.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190805-bluedragon_500.jpeg" alt="Blue-scale dragon miniature, large wings unfurled."></a>
                </div> 
                <p> Along with the announcement of Legendary Adventures, we also showed off all 8 figures in the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01ztd?Pathfinder-Battles-Legendary-Adventures-Preview-Pack">Legendary Adventures Preview Pack</a>, available this month. Each of these figures appears in the full set as a common figure with a new color scheme, giving collectors twice as many options when using them in play. Here are the final versions of the goblin dog-slicer, goblin guard, halfling slinger (all Small), orc charger, bugbear skulker, orc battler, hobgoblin soldier, and armored elf soldier (all Medium). </p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190805-pblap.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190805-pblap.jpg" alt="8 miniatures shown: a goblin dog-slicer with a lowered sword in hand, goblin guard with large bladed weapon - taller than the guard itself - resting on the ground in hand, halfling slinger, charging orc charger, bugbear skulker with diamond shield and mace, orc battler with sword in hand and additional arrows or spears strapped on the back, hobgoblin soldier with hexagon shield on arm, long spear and pointed sword in hand, and armored elf soldier holding a long sword aloft." width="650"></a>
                </div> 
                <p> And since you’ve all been so patient, here are previews of two of the "weapon swap" versions of figures above, which both appear in the uncommon rarity: the goblin horse-chopper and orc rampager (Small and Medium, respectively). </p>

                <p> Just this weekend, Vice-President of Marketing &amp; Licensing Jim Butler and Licensing Manager Glenn Elliott showed off some stunning pictures of the Goblin Camp premium set, which you should be able to find on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/officialpaizo">Paizo’s official Twitch channel</a> now, and on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKEdQmZIhBiPwG7SdQU9oUA">our YouTube channel</a> soon.

                <p itemprop="description">Today is the day! <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfinder">Pathfinder Second Edition</a> is officially here, on store shelves, at online retailers, and soon on game tables all across the world. It’s been more than three years since we first started work in earnest on the new edition, and after all that time—and with the assistance of tens of thousands of playtesters—Pathfinder Second Edition is ready for action!</p> 
                <p>With your help, we’ve developed the familiar Pathfinder rules to make them easier to learn and faster to play without sacrificing the deep character customization that has always been one of Pathfinder’s strongest elements. If anything, Pathfinder Second Edition gives players more opportunities to customize their heroes than ever before. GMs will find more tools for creating dynamic and interesting encounters baked right into the core rules, and even the most familiar monsters of the fantasy genre have new abilities sure to interest even the most experienced RPG veterans.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/080119-innersea.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/080119-innersea_500.jpeg" alt="The Inner Sea."></a>
                </div> 
                <h2>The Core Rules</h2> 
                <p>Everything starts with the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01y0k?Pathfinder-Core-Rulebook">Pathfinder Core Rulebook</a>, 640 pages of rules covering character creation, encounters, exploration, treasure, magic, and more: everything players and GMs need to play and run the new game. With 12 character classes, dozens of backgrounds, and fully developed ancestries including halfling, human, elf, dwarf, gnome, and goblin, players have a near-limitless combination of choices that give even characters with the same class and ancestry a unique gameplay experience.</p> 
                <p>The <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01y0m?Pathfinder-Bestiary">Pathfinder Bestiary</a> presents game statistics and adventure-inspiring lore for more than 400 creatures. Packed with all-new art and completely redesigned monsters, the Bestiary presents an entirely new stat block format designed to speed up play, as well as tons of imaginative new attacks and abilities that take full advantage of Pathfinder Second Edition’s overhauled rules.</p> 
                <h2>Adventures</h2> 
                <p>A new edition is a great opportunity to start a new campaign, and the first monthly installment of the Age of Ashes Adventure Path launches today. <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01y0p?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-Hellknight-Hill">Pathfinder Adventure Path #145: Hellknight Hill</a> kicks off the new campaign in style when strange invaders spill out from an abandoned Hellknight fortress near the heroes’ home village. Secrets uncovered during an exploration of the ruins lead the party all over the world and threaten to unleash an age of draconic tyranny and terror that only the heroes can prevent!</p> 
                <p><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01y0q?Pathfinder-Adventure-The-Fall-of-Plaguestone">Pathfinder Adventures: The Fall of Plaguestone</a> is a 64-page stand-alone adventure for first-level characters designed to tell the story of how your adventuring party first met and became companions. A short job as caravan guards gets much more complicated when the caravan master is poisoned, and the heroes are forced to solve the murder—or hang for it! The <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01y0r?Pathfinder-FlipMat-The-Fall-of-Plaguestone">Pathfinder Flip-Mat: Fall of Plaguestone</a> sets the scene with key encounter areas ready for use with miniatures, helping GMs pull players even further into the fantasy.</p> 
                <p>If you’re looking for a single-session adventure to give the new rules a spin, Paizo’s <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfinderSociety">Pathfinder Society Organized Play</a> program has four Pathfinder Society Scenarios available for download now. In <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01znb?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-101-The-Absalom-Initiation">The Absalom Initiation</a>, the heroes join up as the newest Pathfinder Society agents, rubbing shoulders with veterans and embarking on their new adventuring careers. <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01znc?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-102-The-Mosquito-Witch">The Mosquito Witch</a> puts the heroes on the trail of a mysterious cryptid in the swamps of the cutthroat River Kingdoms. In the perilous ruins of Lastwall, where the undead armies of the Whispering Tyrant prowl a ravaged wasteland, Pathfinder Society agents race against time to save priceless artifacts and missing-in-action colleagues in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01znd?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-103-Escaping-the-Grave">Escaping the Grave</a>. With a running time of about 1 hour, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01zne?Pathfinder-Society-Quest-1A-The-Sandstone-Secret">The Sandstone Secret</a> presents a fast and furious dungeon crawl and a fun first look at the Pathfinder rules.</p> 
                <p>Pathfinder Society also provides a set of <a href="/products/btq01zt5?Community-Use-Package-PF2E-Iconics-Pregenerated-Characters">pregenerated characters</a> that allow you to skip character creation and jump right into the action. A fifth Pathfinder Society Scenario, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01zna?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-100-Origin-of-the-Open-Road">Origin of the Open Road</a>, delves into the history of the Pathfinder Society over the course of a thrilling 5th-level adventure designed specifically for use with pregenerated characters.</p> 
                <h2>Accessories</h2> Pathfinder Second Edition Launch Day also brings several new accessories you’ll want to check out. The <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01y0s?Pathfinder-Character-Sheet-Pack">Pathfinder Character Sheet Pack</a> provides custom character sheets for each class, putting the focus on those abilities most important to your character. You can also download a free basic Pathfinder Second Edition character sheet in <a href="https://paizo.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/PZO2101-CharacterSheet-Color.pdf">color</a> or <a href="https://paizo.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/PZO2101-CharacterSheet-BW.pdf">black-and-white formats</a>. Helpful charts and beautiful art combine in two brand new Pathfinder GM Screens (pick your preference between <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01y0t?Pathfinder-GM-Screen">horizontal</a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01y0u?Pathfinder-GM-Screen">vertical</a> orientations). Our new <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01y0w?Pathfinder-Condition-Card-Deck">Pathfinder Condition Cards</a> put the details of the game’s commonly encountered conditions in the hands of players, reducing page flips and keeping the focus on the action. We’ve also updated our popular <a hfref="https://paizo.com/products/btq01y0v?Pathfinder-Combat-Pad">Pathfinder Combat Pad</a> initiative tracker, still the best way to keep track of turn order in combat.
