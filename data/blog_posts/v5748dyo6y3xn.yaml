  \ Posada.</p>\n      </div>\n      <br>\n      <p>When human civilization clawed\
  \ its way out from the Age of Darkness thousands of years ago, the Magaambya was\
  \ one of the first flickers of light. Founded by Old-Mage Jatembe and his Ten Magic\
  \ Warriors in the jungles of the Mwangi Expanse, the school still embraces their\
  \ legacy as the Inner Sea region’s oldest school of magic.</p>\n      <p>The school\
  \ has recently begun to take a more active role in the wider world. Magaambyans\
  \ see the Convocation as part of that broader effort, an extension of their teachers’\
  \ efforts in offering aid to the scattered Sarkorian people and helping gather their\
  \ stories.</p>\n      <p>All five of the school’s branches of study are represented\
  \ among the Magaambyan delegates. Although the school sees these branches as part\
  \ of the same whole, the branches take on very different roles in the Magaambya\
  \ and at the Convocation. The storytelling Uzunjati branch is the best known outside\
  \ the school, but Emerald Boughs are prepared to navigate social situations while\
  \ Tempest-Sun Mages gear up to fight a different continent’s demons.</p>\n     \

  \ long after their masks and artifacts are returned to their homes. Although the\
  \ tree might look out of place in the north’s harsh winters, the stories told beneath\
  \ its boughs know no seasonal boundaries.</p>\n      <p>The Uzunjati presence at\
  \ the Convocation can be felt strongly in other ways, as they pass on their stories\
  \ and the magic contained within them. They even return a tale of old Sarkoris,\
  \ brought to life by that story and their magic, as a gift to their hosts.</p>\n\
  \      <p>But all five branches of the Magaambya do share a common teaching in the\
  \ wizardly <b>School of Rooted Wisdom</b>. Beyond the shared teachings of Old-Mage\
  \ Jatembe, each branch has grown from it in a different direction over the millennia,\
  \ whether exploring the theory of magic as a Cascade Bearer or the boundaries of\
  \ the physical world as a Rain-Scribe.</p>\n      <br>\n      <h2>Monastery of the\

  \ Waves by Sandra Posada.</p>\n      </div>\n      <br>\n      <p>As one of the\
  \ Houses of Perfection, the Monastery of the Unbreaking Waves seeks enlightenment\
  \ and martial inspiration in one of the elements. In their case, it is the flexible\
  \ and unyielding progress of water, flowing around and wearing away all obstacles.</p>\n\
  \      <p>For centuries, only three Houses of Perfection stood in Jalmeray, representing\
  \ air, earth, and fire. The Monastery of the Unbreaking Waves had been destroyed\
  \ by one of its rivals and pulled into the sea by a great tsunami. It’s only recently\
  \ that their teachings were returned to the surface with the help of the Pathfinder\
  \ Society. Although still rebuilding toward its original heights, that history has\
  \ brought this monastery to the Convocation to prevent such a tragic loss from repeating\
  \ itself.</p>\n      <p>Beyond this philosophical connection with the elements,\
  \ each House of Perfection learned many of their techniques directly from the genies\
  \ associated with their element. In the Unbreaking Waves’ case, they learn from\
  \ faydhaan, who are known for their diplomatic nature and flexible thinking.</p>\n\

  \      </div>\n      <br>\n      <p>As the buildings and membership of the monastery\
  \ are rebuilt, so are its techniques. Recovered ancient scrolls, once thought lost\
  \ forever beneath the waves, offer a foundation to rebuild on, but new blood and\
  \ ideas are revitalizing the school’s curriculum.</p>\n      <p>The core techniques\
  \ of the Unbreaking Waves are still practiced by monks, empowering themselves with\
  \ understanding of water and breath. Always metaphorical and philosophical, the\
  \ waves can also become crushingly real in the hands of an experienced monk. But,\
  \ even among the order’s traditional monastic practices, new blade stances and techniques\
  \ aim to challenge their old rivals among the Monastery of Untwisting Iron.</p>\n\
  \      <p>The new approaches can be seen most clearly among those studying the <b>Resurgent\
  \ Maelstrom</b>. Combining faydhaan spells and techniques with mortal ingenuity,\
  \ a magus can use the power of water to turn any tool into a weapon and embrace\
  \ their transience by shattering them against their foes.</p>\n      <br>\n    \

  \      </div>\n      <br>\n      <p>The University of Lepidstadt, despite being\
  \ at the forefront of medical and technological advancement, is not always well\
  \ regarded in its native Ustalav. Many would call it a home of graverobbers and\
  \ monstrous experiments, although the medical students find the results quite educational.</p>\n\
  \      <p>The university students, even those focusing on less controversial fields\
  \ of study, find the Convocation a breath of fresh air. Certainly, the Kith are\
  \ noisy and the Magaambyans may have uncomfortable questions about what exactly\
  \ is inside the Lepidstadt exhibit, but the constant pressure and automatic judgment\
  \ is lessened. Sadly, it can’t last forever, and eventually the students will have\
  \ to return to their dimly lit halls and sinister rumors.</p>\n      <p>Some students\
  \ have an additional cause to celebrate. The university once accepted Sarkorians\
  \ fleeing the demons who overran their land, although Ustalav at large was by no\
  \ means welcoming, and many descendants of Sarkorian refugees among Lepidstadt’\
  s delegation are able to visit their ancestral homeland for the first time.</p>\n\

  \ </div>\n      <br>\n      <p>Law, theology, and even wizardry are all taught at\
  \ Lepidstadt, but it’s best known for medicine. Lepidstadt surgeons are among the\
  \ best in the world, both as healers and in theoretical understanding. They attribute\
  \ this to the hands-on experience of dismantling cadavers and practicing on volunteers.\
  \ Whether the newest techniques can be used to open an enemy’s veins or stir dead\
  \ flesh to a parody of life is a question best left for campfire tales.</p>\n  \
  \    <p>The School of Science has also begun to make a name for itself, although\
  \ it’s beset with its own controversies. A number of Stasian coils, covered with\
  \ arcing electricity and interacting with subtler occult energies, have been smuggled\
  \ into the school for experiments. The most recent breakthroughs involve using those\
  \ coils to treat glass, creating a variety of gadgets that can drive off otherworldly\
  \ beings or steal away part of a target’s aura.</p>\n      <p>Perhaps their most\
  \ complicated work is their exhibit, a scientific and occult marvel that takes the\
  \ shape of a heavy cabinet spiked with Stasian coils. The electricity, through shapes\
  \ and symbols and a crackling voice, seeks to answer questions posed to it. Although\
  \ even the Lepidstadt students aren’t necessarily sure what’s inside it, they do\
  \ ask that people stop trying to exorcize it.</p>\n      <br>\n      <h2>School\
