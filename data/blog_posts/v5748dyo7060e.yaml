  \      <p>Time flies in the Drift, huh? It seems like just yesterday we released\
  \ two new classes for you to play around with, and it’s already past time for a\
  \ wrap up! The Starfinder Second Edition tech class playtest featuring the mechanic\
  \ and technomancer formally concluded on May 30th. Since then, the Starfinder team\
  \ has been eagerly and diligently reading every word that’s been submitted on the\
  \ playtest surveys. And remember: even though the playtest is over, you can still\
  \ use the playtest mechanic and playtest technomancer until the two classes are\
  \ officially released, including in Starfinder Society Organized Play.</p>\n   \

  \   </div>\n      <br>\n      <p>The <strong>mechanic</strong> was overall a hit,\
  \ but we have some tune-ups planned for the class before the final release. We noticed\
  \ players had trouble using mines and turrets when fighting flying enemies and in\
  \ zero gravity environments, so we’re looking into ways to make them a little more\
  \ three-dimensionally compatible. Many players were confused about how and when\
  \ turrets can be repaired, deployed, and deactivated and we will be looking into\
  \ options to make sure that if your turret is stolen by a disgruntled enemy, you\
  \ can still participate in the fight to retrieve your little buddy. We are also\
  \ looking into sprucing up mods, potentially opening ways to affect allies’ weapons\
  \ and making mods last a little longer, but we need to run more internal testing\
  \ before we can make any promises!</p>\n      <p><strong>Technomancer</strong> requires\
  \ some significant changes to make the class easier to play, less action starved,\
  \ and add in more class features they can use with technology. We are currently\
  \ looking at retooling Overclock Gear, perhaps combining it with more versatile\
  \ Magic Hacks to highlight each programming language’s gear and shifting the focus\
  \ of some of its class features away from spellshapes. We are also introducing minions\
  \ called minibots you can purchase with credits as early as level 1. Minibots can\
  \ help adventurers of any class with simple tasks, like recording video or carrying\
  \ a single small item.</p>\n      <p>These are just a few of the potential changes\
  \ we’re planning to test out internally. We’ve had a blast reading your feedback\
  \ and hearing about your playtest experiences. Thanks again for your participation\
  \ in the Starfinder tech class playtest!</p>\n      <p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\
