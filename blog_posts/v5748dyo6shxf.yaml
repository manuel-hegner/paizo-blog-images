  \     </div> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">“You stand\
  \ defeated, Voradni Voon!” Melika shouted, brandishing her tin sword at Elophos.\
  \ The older actor bellowed, throwing his hands up in a defiant gesture meant to\
  \ cover a quick tightening of the straps holding on his minotaur horns, which had\
  \ begun to slide dangerously sideways.</p> \n      <p>“Never!” Elophos cried, trotting\
  \ back a few showy steps as he finished steadying his headgear. Horns secured, he\
  \ charged forward again, thrusting his sword at Melika. “So long as he stands, Voradni\
  \ Voon is not defeated!”</p> \n      <p>“The earth has swallowed your army. Your\
  \ centaurs are dead, your harpies scattered like frightened pigeons. Surrender!”\
  \ Melika jabbed at Elophos’s midsection. The thrust was absurdly slow and clumsy—\
  old Halvorash would have boxed her ears for signaling the lunge with her eyes and\
  \ feet so long before she struck—but the flaws that would have doomed her in an\
  \ alley fight were virtues on the stage. An audience wasn’t a footpad with a shank;\
  \ you were <em>supposed</em> to help them see what was coming.</p> \n      <p>“\
  Voradni Voon will devour your heart and claim your godhood, puny human!” Elophos\
  \ roared, swinging his stubby sword in broad arcs. Both actors’ weapons were shortened,\
  \ letting them maximize the number of swings they could make before reaching each\
  \ other onstage. Melika was impressed that Elophos managed to fit six full arcs\
  \ in before he closed on her. He must have tweaked his pacing; he’d only ever managed\
  \ five before.</p> \n      <p>She dropped to one knee, exaggerating the height difference\
  \ between them, and thrust upward, gripping her abbreviated sword’s hilt with both\
  \ hands like a spear. Another absurdity for the stage, but it roused an anticipatory\
  \ cheer from the audience, and then an expectant hush.</p> \n      <p>Elophos didn’\
  t disappoint them. Menacingly he stalked forward, having backed away in mock apprehension\
  \ as Melika crouched. He charged straight onto the up-thrust point, then staggered\
  \ back with a thunderous gasp, his sword arm pinwheeling in feigned death agonies.\
  \ “Nooo!”</p> \n      <p>“You would not stand defeated, Voradni Voon, so you must\
  \ fall,” Melika intoned, striking a heroic pose, as Elophos crumpled slowly to the\
  \ stage boards, clutching the blade “impaled” into his chest to keep it from falling.</p>\

  ><em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Absalom, City of Lost Omens</em></a></h3>\n      </div>\
  \ \n      <br> \n      <p>The audience burst into cheers. Elophos skipped back to\
  \ his feet, handed Melika her sword, and shared a bow as the curtains came down.\
  \ No sooner had the gold-fringed cloth dropped over them than they hopped down the\
  \ back stairs, moving aside so the stage crew could clear their painted scenery\
  \ and set up the next troupe’s props.</p> \n      <p>Already, the painted wooden\
  \ harpies and centaurs from <em>The Defeat of Voradni Voon</em> were being loaded\
  \ onto wagons to be carted away for storage. They’d performed the act six times\
  \ today, moving from stage to stage across Absalom, and now they were done. The\
  \ sun was sinking westward, and night was soon to drop a final curtain on Foundation\
  \ Day.</p> \n      <p>It had been glorious—but now, already, Melika felt the warmth\
  \ of the crowds and her own joy stealing away from her as swiftly as the fading\
  \ light.</p> \n      <p>Melika sighed. She pulled off the papier-mache crown and\
  \ false mustache she’d worn as Aroden, unhooked the gaudy, gold-lined cape that\
  \ she’d swirled through six victories over Voradni Voon, and folded them up, along\
  \ with her dreams, inside the box that Elophos’s troupe would soon pack away.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>She wasn’t an actor, not really, not like the rest of them. Melika\
  \ was just a serving girl. That morning, she’d been carrying a pitcher of wash water\
  \ through the commons, just as the visiting troupe learned that their original Aroden\
  \ was chained to her chamber pot following an encounter with a bad eel pie.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>As the actors were absorbing the bad news, one of the inn’s cats ran\
  \ under Melika’s feet. She’d jumped, side-stepped, and recovered without spilling\
  \ a drop. This impromptu demonstration led Elophos to conclude that she was strong\
  \ and nimble enough to handle the fight choreography, about the right size to fit\
  \ into Aroden’s costume, and therefore an adequate substitute for the show that\
  \ they were contractually obligated to put onstage in two hours.</p> \n      <p>“\
  You’ll have ten lines,” he’d told her as he buckled the green-gold cape around her\
  \ shoulders and pasted the horsehair mustache onto her face. “You can do it. Ten\
  \ lines, and it doesn’t even matter if you get them wrong.”</p> \n      <p>She hadn’\
  t gotten them wrong. Six times she’d performed, each better than the last, as she\
  \ learned to draw out the crowd and channel its energy into joy.</p> \n      <p>And\
  \ now it was over. Playing at the actor’s life had been fun, but Melika had siblings\
  \ to feed and a sickly mother to tend. That painted crown wasn’t real gold, and\
  \ it wouldn’t keep her family clothed.</p> \n      <p>Heroism seemed so simple on\
  \ stage. Maybe that was what people really liked to cheer, more than Aroden: the\
  \ uncomplicated surety of right and wrong. The odds were stacked, the lines were\
  \ scripted, and the heroes of legend never had anyone but themselves to think about.\
  \ Their families were always conveniently faraway or dead—or at the very least,\
  \ dependent on the same dramatic acts that the hero was already poised to commit.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Heroes on a stage didn’t have to be quietly reliable for those they\
  \ loved. Their bravado was just like their fighting: showy and false, with none\
  \ of the dirt or desperation that grimed real struggle.</p> \n      <p>Melika sighed.\
  \ Though false, the dream was tempting. It surely was a pretty crown. And she’d\
  \ probably never again touch cloth as fine as that cloak’s, stained and threadbare\
  \ though it was.</p> \n      <p>“You alright?” Elophos asked, vigorously toweling\
  \ his sweat-matted hair. Six mock fights under the heavy, horned pelt of Voradni\
  \ Voon had left him soaked.</p> \n      <p>“I need to get back to work,” Melika\
  \ told him.</p> \n      <p>He counted out the money, then paused. “It’s Foundation\
  \ Day. You don’t have the day off to celebrate?”</p> \n      <p>“Someone has to\
  \ work for other people to celebrate,” Melika pointed out, dryly, but only after\
  \ she’d pocketed the coin. You didn’t talk back before you got their money. “You\
  \ didn’t think all those mugs of beer poured or washed themselves, did you?” It\
  \ occurred to her that maybe he <em>did</em> think that. Nobody had ever said that\
  \ actors were overburdened with good sense.</p> \n      <p>Elophos just shrugged.\
  \ “But it’s Foundation Day.”</p> \n      <p>“It is. So I should get back. They’\
  ll need me.”</p> \n      <p>“You could stay with us. Be an actor. You’re a natural\
  \ on stage.”</p> \n      <p>“For less than what I earn now?” Melika snorted. She’\
  d worked hard for that inn job. Decent pay, extra food, sometimes clothes or even\
  \ boots that drunk patrons left behind. If Elophos had ever been half as cold and\
  \ hungry as she’d been before the inn, he would know what it meant to give that\
  \ up.</p> \n      <p>“It might not be less. Not for long.” His speculative look\
  \ was greedy enough that she almost believed him. “You’ve got talent.”</p> \n  \
  \    <p>“Talent and a houseful of hungry siblings. Guess which one yells louder.”\
  </p> \n      <p>“Well, think about it.” Elophos tossed the towel over his shoulder.\
  \ “A lot of us will be headed to the Wounded Wisp after sundown, if you think you\
  \ can get away from washing those beer mugs for a bit. Talk to some people. Make\
  \ some friends. Perhaps you’ll see that the stage pays well enough to keep a houseful\
  \ of hungry siblings fed.”</p> \n      <p>“Maybe.” Melika walked away, through the\
  \ thronging crowds of revelers, other people’s joy and laughter scattered around\
  \ her like flower petals. She didn’t begrudge their happiness. It meant good tips.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>And as she walked, she turned Elophos’s suggestion around and around,\
  \ like a coin in her pocket she was debating how to spend. Maybe she did have talent.\
  \ Maybe she could feed her family that way. Maybe it wasn’t stupid to spend an hour\
  \ finding out.</p> \n      <p>The Wounded Wisp...</p> \n     </blockquote> \n  \
