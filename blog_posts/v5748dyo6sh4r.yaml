  \ a Bestiary Bundle!</b><br> Using accessories can really enhance your game, and\
  \ I couldn’t be more excited for people to get their hands on the new <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/products/btq0206k?Pathfinder-Bestiary-Battle-Cards\">Pathfinder\
  \ Bestiary Battle Cards</a>. I helped put them together and during the process I\
  \ was constantly thinking how they could make a game easier by just plucking out\
  \ the cards you need for the session and not have to flip through the Bestiary.\
  \ You can even throw together a quick encounter by grabbing a few cards from the\
  \ box, plucking the corresponding pawns from the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq0206t?Pathfinder-Bestiary-Pawn-Box\"\
  >Pathfinder Bestiary Pawn Box</a>, and slapping down a Flip-Mat on your table. Since\
  \ I was thinking about it, I did just that and want to share it with all of you.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The encounter below is intended for 3rd-level Pathfinder characters.\
  \ If you don’t have a 3rd-level character and don’t want to make one for this encounter,\
  \ pick up one of the 3rd-level pregens <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01zt5?Community-Use-Package-PF2E-Iconics-Pregenerated-Characters\"\
  >here</a>.</p> \n     <p>It takes place in an area of rugged badlands, although\
  \ you could set this pretty much anywhere gnolls could be found, deserts, plains,\
  \ or hills. For this encounter, consider using the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01zyv?Pathfinder-FlipMat-Ambush-Sites-MultiPack\"\
  >Pathfinder Flip-Mat: Ambush Sites Multi-Pack</a>.</p> \n     <p>You’ll need the\
  \ following pawns and cards from the Bestiary Pawn Box and Bestiary Battle Cards:</p>\
  \ \n     <ul> \n      <li>Gnoll Hunter</li> \n      <li>Hyena</li> \n      <li>Pugwampi\

  \     <h3>Badlands Ambush Moderate 3</h3> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p>\"Tasked\
  \ with delivering vital supplies to an isolated outpost, you’ve been traveling through\
  \ the rocky badlands of western Katapesh. Worried about attacks by bandits and other\
  \ threats of the desert, your group has been traveling along a nearly dry riverbed\
  \ to keep your profiles low.\"</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>The PCs aren’\
  t alone on their trek. A lone gnoll hunter named Magorek has been out hunting with\
  \ her trusted hyena for food to provide food for her band. Unfortunately for her,\
  \ she picked up a couple of tag-alongs—a pair of mischievous pugwampis. Magorek\
  \ isn’t pleased with the fawning gremlins following along, but she hadn’t run them\
  \ off yet thinking that they might provide a useful edge in case she comes across\
  \ any threats too big for her to handle. In her search for prey, Magorek stuck to\
  \ the dry riverbed in hopes of finding game that came to the small stream to drink.\
  \ </p> \n     <p><b>Creatures</b>: It’s here where Magorek hears the PCs footfalls\
  \ echo down the rocky walls of the riverbed. She can’t yet see the PCs, but her\
  \ keen survival skills let her know that there are more than just a couple people.\
  \ Unsure if she can take the group, she quiets the bickering pugwampis and takes\
  \ cover to hide. The PCs are unaware that they’re about to walk into an ambush.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Magorek stays hidden, waiting to see the PCs so she can size them up.\
  \ Unafraid of the threat and certain she can take the PCs—and bring home meat to\
  \ her fellow gnolls—Magorek attacks as soon as the PCs are within 40 feet. One of\
  \ the pugwampis see her draw her bow and follow suit. When combat starts, the hyena\
  \ rushes to the closest PC, savages them with its powerful jaws, and attempts to\
  \ drag the character back to the gnoll. One of the pugwampis stays back with Magorek\
  \ and fires at the PCs, while the other runs to the group sword drawn. If the hyena\
  \ manages to successfully use its Drag action on a PC, Magorek drops her bow and\
  \ engages the PCs in melee on her next turn. The toadying pugwampi, of course, follows.\
  \ If Magorek is reduced to 10 Hit Points or fewer, she takes the time to drink one\
  \ of her lesser healing potions (see Treasure below). If Magorek is reduced to 5\
  \ Hit Points or fewer, she shamefully attempts to flee, showing no concern for her\
  \ companions.</p> <a href=\"http://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/022820_GnollWarriorjpg.jpg\"\
