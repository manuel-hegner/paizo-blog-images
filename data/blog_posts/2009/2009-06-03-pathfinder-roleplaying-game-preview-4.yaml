  \ border=\"0\" align=\"right\"></a>\n           <blockquote>\n            <p>Let\
  \ me tell you a little story.</p>\n            <p>For months now, stories were spreading\
  \ about brutal attacks made against merchant caravans making their way through the\
  \ Mindspin Mountains. While not uncommon during this time of year, the savagery\
  \ of the attacks and the reports of a giant man, bedecked with ice, caught Harsk's\
  \ attention. Not a week later, Harsk was high up the mountains, casting about for\
  \ a trail. He had already encountered a pair of slaughtered caravans, when he found\
  \ one that was recently attacked. Fresh boot prints in the snow confirmed his suspicions.\
  \ It was a frost giant. For two days he followed the trail without fault, leading\
  \ deeper into the mountains before ending at the mouth of a deep, dark cave. Sneaking\
  \ inside, the wily dwarf quickly found his prey, sorting through a vast pile of\
  \ ill-gotten loot. The giant had no idea that death had come for him as Harsk took\
  \ aim with his trusted crossbow.</p>\n            <p>This is the sort of situation\
  \ a ranger like Harsk dreams of. Having caught the giant in a cave, he has immense\
  \ bonuses against the behemoth. Using his favored terrain bonuses, Harsk received\
  \ a +2 on all Survival skill checks when tracking the giant through the mountains.\
  \ In the caves (which count as underground), this bonus increases to a +4. It also\
  \ applies to his initiative (giving him a great chance at going first), Perception,\
  \ and Stealth checks. His favored enemy bonuses against giants of +6 applies to\
  \ Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks made against the\
  \ giant, but more importantly, it applies to his attack and damage rolls. Added\
  \ up, these bonuses give him a +32 bonus on Survival checks to track the giant in\
  \ the caves (+30 in the mountains) and a +28 to avoid being spotted as he sneaks\
  \ up to within 30 feet for the attack.</p>\n            <p>Assuming Harsk gets the\
  \ drop on the giant, he can use Pinpoint Targeting during the surprise round to\
  \ ensure he gets a hit. This feat allows him to make a single attack as a standard\
  \ action that ignores armor, natural armor, and shield bonuses to AC (which drops\
  \ the giant's AC down to 8). If he wins initiative, he can then take a full attack\
  \ against the giant. Using Deadly Aim (which allows him to take a –3 penalty on\
  \ attack rolls to gain a +6 bonus on damage rolls, just like Power Attack but for\
  \ ranged weapons), his bonus on these attacks comes out to +19/+19/+14/+9 with each\
  \ attack dealing 1d8+14 plus 1d6 electricity and 2d6 from the <i>axiomatic</i> quality.\
  \ If Harsk hits with all 4 attacks (and the surprise attack, which deals a little\
  \ less damage), his average damage is around 138 points of damage, which is just\
  \ enough to put the giant in his grave.</p>\n            <p></p>\n            <p>If\
  \ Harsk really wanted to ensure success, he would denote the giant as his quarry\
  \ before combat begins. This ability is gained at 11th level and it allows a ranger\
  \ to select a creature that matches one of his favored enemy types as his quarry,\
  \ granting him a +2 bonus on attack rolls and automatically confirming all critical\
  \ hits against the target. He can also take 10 on Survival checks to track his quarry\
  \ while moving at full speed without penalty. Although Harsk can have no more than\
  \ one quarry at a time, he can select a new quarry 1 hour after his previous quarry\
  \ is slain.</p>\n            <p>Now, this is not exactly a fair fight, as Harsk\
  \ is built to kill giants in caves, but rangers are built to excel in specific circumstances.\
  \ Against other enemies or in other environments, they are still capable combatants,\
  \ but they really shine when hunting their favored enemies or while adventuring\
  \ in their favored terrain.</p>\n            <p></p>\n            <p>Harsk also\
  \ possesses the hunter's bond class feature, which allows him to grant any allies\
  \ within 30 feet half of his favored enemy bonus against one foe as a move action.\
  \ Once given, this bonus lasts for 3 rounds. He could have taken an animal companion\
  \ instead, but we will discuss those in more detail during the druid preview. For\
  \ now, remember that if Harsk were to take an animal companion, his effective druid\
  \ level would be 8th (not 5th, as it was in 3.5).</p>\n            <p>In addition,\
  \ Harsk has a few spells to aid him in his struggles. He now casts spells with a\
  \ caster level equal to his ranger level –3 (instead of half his ranger level).\
  \ His progression has also been improved a bit, giving him a few extra spells. Of\
  \ special note is <i>summon nature's ally III</i>, which allows him to summon a\
  \ boar, a wolverine, or even 1d3 Small earth elementals. Take a look at the following\
  \ lists for more examples (some might even say this was a sneak peak at the <a href=\"\
  /pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy85k5\"><i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i></a>).</p>\n      \

  \    <p></p>\n            </blockquote>\n            <p>Harsk has a few other abilities\
  \ as well. Swift tracker allows Harsk to move his normal speed while using Survival\
  \ to track and reduces the penalty to –10 while moving at twice his normal speed.\
  \ Track now grants a bonus on Survival checks made to follow tracks equal to 1/2\
  \ his ranger level. This change was made because everyone can track now using Survival,\
  \ making the ability redundant. At higher levels, Harsk would gain additional favored\
  \ enemies and terrains, additional combat style feats (additional archery feats\
  \ in Harsk's case), improved evasion, camouflage, hide in plain sight, and at 20th\
  \ level, the master hunter ability. This ability allows him to kill his favored\
  \ enemies with a single bolt, assuming they fail their saves. He can also use this\
  \ ability to deal nonlethal damage equal to the target's hit point total, allowing\
  \ him to bring his prey back alive.</p>\n            <p></p>\n            <p>That\
  \ covers the ranger. Come back next week and enter the domains of Kyra, the iconic\
