  \ after we announced the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/giantslayer\">Giantslayer\
  \ Adventure Path</a>, Wes was contacted by a group of maniacs who had plans to run\
  \ marathon sessions of the Adventure Path and do a full and thorough report. Since\
  \ I work on the Adventure Paths, I took over coordinating with those hardcore gamers,\
  \ and I'm happy to be able to present the first of six reports we'll feature here\
  \ on the blog.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <h2>The Giantslayer Endeavor</h2> \n\

  \     </div> \n     <p>Pathfinder fans: How far have you taken your devotion to\
  \ the game? What's the longest session you have ever played? We are <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/orderoftheamberdie\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Order of the Amber Die</a>, an association of Pathfinder players,\
  \ and for nearly 3 decades we have been playing marathon sessions of 48 hours, 72—\
  even one 96-er. Last summer, we <a href=\"/threads/rzs2rhtg\">documented our journey\
  \ through the <em>The Emerald Spire Superdungeon</em></a>, which was completed in\
  \ just 35 days (195 hours). Now we're going for something much bigger. In fact,\
  \ we're trying to do something so grand that we haven't been able to find documentation\
  \ for anything this ambitious since the founding of the world's oldest fantasy roleplaying\
  \ game.</p> \n     <p>Welcome to The Giantslayer Endeavor!</p> \n     <p>From March\
  \ through August, 2015, we are attempting to play all six volumes of the Giantslayer\
  \ Adventure Path. Each volume will be played in a marathon of roughly 48-72 hours,\
  \ and maybe we'll throw in another 96-er to close out. Better yet: we're documenting\
  \ the whole thing as a contribution to the RPG community. We don't know if we will\
  \ succeed; we don't even know if our lives, careers, and loved ones can handle this.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>To add extra challenge over the years, we have evolved our game into\
  \ what we now call \"Xtreme Pathfinder.\" Playing only published adventures, we\
  \ use the rules, our GM brings the adventures to life as written, and we try our\
  \ best to beat what the authors throw at us. Character death is accepted as part\
  \ of the game, and we don't ask for leniency from Paizo's authors. If Pathfinder\
  \ could be made into a competitive sport between a party and a module, our game\
  \ would be it.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb180\">\n      <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderAdventurePath/20150404-Photo3.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderAdventurePath/20150404-Photo3_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Why Giantslayer? It's as courageous of an adventure\
  \ path as has ever been published. You don't have to be a veteran to understand\
  \ the nigh-irreproachable aura that surrounds the name Gary Gygax. It takes the\
  \ heroism of Iomedae herself to even tread near the sacred ground that was G1-2-3,\
  \ Against the Giants, and yet that's exactly what Paizo has done. We have played\
  \ through Gygax's series twice in serious form, and from the very first moments\
  \ of \"Battle of Bloodmarch Hill\", Paizo has made it clear that this will be no\
  \ rehash—they will carve their own path through the halls of the big folk.</p> \n\
  \     <h3>Highlights from our Experience with \"The Battle of Bloodmarch Hill\"\
  </h3> \n     <p>The maps were as unique and detailed as we had hoped. We spent an\
  \ entire Saturday exploring a map that was literally (and figuratively) a sandbox\
  \ at 9 ft. x 5 ft (with some amazing miniatures painted by <a href=\"http://bluetablepainting.com/\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Blue Table Painting</a>). During a climactic battle for a barricade\
  \ played on this depiction of Trunau's inner quarter, Zadim the slayer hurled back\
  \ an unexploded grenade just in time for it to detonate at the feet of the surprised\
  \ orc who threw it.</p> \n     <p>Though we spent nearly half of the marathon roleplaying\
  \ our way through an intricate investigation (props to the author for opening Giantslayer\
  \ with a curveball), the rest of the module was packed with tough fights. With TPK\
  \ looming in a tactically complex encounter, a 4th-level Crowe the bloodrager took\
  \ on—and took down—two dire wolves by himself to put the other members in position\
  \ for the win. Clutch.</p> \n     <p>Author Patrick Renie provided our group with\
  \ something that despite having more than 140 years of combined experience at the\
  \ table, we had never been a part of: a tug of war.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ></a> \n     </div> \n     <h3>Character Deaths</h3> \n     <p>At the close of a\
  \ frenzy that is being called \"the 19-rounder,\" a final orc shield-breaker wielding\
  \ a shotel stood his ground against Oloch the warpriest. The Amber Die that is our\
  \ namesake delivered back-to-back 20s, killing Oloch and earning the orc a place\
  \ beside his lord Nulgreth.</p> \n     <p>During a special operation to destroy\
  \ a siege engine, Quinn the investigator found himself grappled by orc bombardiers,\
  \ forced into a catapult, and then launched 50 ft. in the air—well over the walls\
  \ of Trunau. A hard landing marked his death as one of our most unforgettable.</p>\
  \ \n     <h3>Current Situation</h3> \n     <p>The adventure proved difficult, and\
  \ the party is in rough shape. They had to sell almost everything earned (a significant\
  \ haul) to bring their slain companions back to life. They are entering <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9c1v\">\"The Hill Giant's Pledge\"</a> with two characters that are\
  \ under-level, and only three possessions of importance. We play a tight game to\
  \ create intensity, and CRs will not be adjusted down. Luckily, one of these items\
  \ is an artifact.</p> \n     <h3>Best Quote from Marathon Part 1</h3> \n     <p>Aerick\
  \ (Oloch): \"I slept in the same 5-foot square that I roleplayed for 77 hours.\"\
