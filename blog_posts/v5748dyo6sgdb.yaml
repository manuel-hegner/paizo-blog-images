  Know Direction, Spotlights and Conventions!!</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Thursday,\
  \ November 8, 2018</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  \ style=\"display:none;\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PFSUpdates2.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PFSUpdates2_180.jpeg\"></a>\n    </div>\
  \ \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">I'm amazed how quickly this year's flown by.\
  \ It seems only yesterday I booked my tickets for MarsCon and now we are rapidly\
  \ approaching my final convention of the year. The events this year provided many\
  \ opportunities to meet and interact with members of our community. I look forward\
  \ to U-Con this weekend and visiting more Society members. Hanging out with our\
  \ players and GMs is one of my favorite parts of being the Organized Play Manger.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Besides conventions, another favorite part of my job is the program planning\
  \ aspect. Over the past few weeks, the team's done quite a bit of brainstorming\
  \ on the wrap-up to Pathfinder Society version 1 and the launch of Pathfinder Society\
  \ version 2. On the Starfinder front, we're well into Season 2 program planning\
  \ and have even glanced at Season 3. So many storylines! For those of you looking\
  \ to plan convention schedules, it is our intention to launch the new season of\
  \ Pathfinder Adventure Card Guild at PaizoCon, Starfinder Society at Origins, and\
  \ Pathfinder Society version 2 at Gen Con.</p> \n    <p>If you want an update to\
  \ our thoughts on the future of Pathfinder Society, Organized Play Lead Developer\
  \ John Compton and I were on Know Direction yesterday. We discussed many of the\
  \ topics posted on the Paizo.com blogs over the past few months, as well as answered\
  \ questions from the community. Visit <a href=\"http://knowdirectionpodcast.com/2018/11/know-direction-188-pathfinder-societys-future/\"\
  >Know Direction's website</a> to watch the interview!</p> \n    <h2>Campaign Coins</h2>\
  \ \n    <p>While in Australia at PaizoCon Asia-Pacific, I left two coins in the\
  \ care of one of the area's Venture Officers and asked him to present the coins\
  \ on behalf of the organized play team. Until this is done, I'm keeping the recipient's\
  \ name quiet. Hopefully we can announce the worthy inductees in the first of December\
  \ blog.</p> \n    <p>If you know a deserving member of your community, please email\
  \ me at<u><a href=\"mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com\">organizedplay@paizo.com</a></u>\
  \ with their name, location, and the reasons you feel they should be recognized\
  \ for their service. If you are able, please include what events they may attend\
  \ in 2018/2019 so that we can either make awards in person (preferred) or make arrangements\
  \ for deliver.</p> \n    <h2>Stars and Novas</h2> \n    <p>All the conventions over\
  \ the past months gave lots of opportunities for GMs to achieve the requirements\
  \ and qualify for their 5<sup>th</sup> star. To achieve this milestone, GMs run\
  \ 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios,\
  \ as well as run a game for a venture-captain. A conservative estimate of time needed\
  \ to reach 5-stars is 650 hours! To the GMs listed below, thank you very much for\
  \ the time and energy you spend running Pathfinder Society games! Huge congratulations\
  \ on your achievement!</p> \n    <ul> \n     <li>Gregory Ison</li> \n     <li>Sam\
  \ Sampson</li> \n     <li>Bruce Legge</li> \n     <li>Dennis Muldoon</li> \n   \
  \  <li>Nicholas Ruchlewicz</li> \n     <li>Terry Kaden</li> \n    </ul> \n    <p>The\
  \ organized play team formulated their first draft of the 5-nova qualifications\
  \ and are soliciting feedback from a variety of sources. We should have an update\
  \ next month!</p> \n    <p>Looking forward to Pathfinder Society version 2, I've\
  \ seen suggestions for using either Glyphs (using the Symbol of the Open Road) or\
  \ Sigils (using the Sihedrion) for the GM designator. Thanks to those that have\
  \ voted! I'd like one more month of data gathering before we make a decision. You\
  \ can find the poll<a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgav?October-Update-PAX-Unplugged-Spotlights-and#19\"\
  >in the following blog</a>. If you haven't voted, you have until 1st Dec to do so.</p>\
  \ \n    <h2>PAX Unplugged</h2> \n    <p>The organization team is in the process\
  \ of sending out volunteer schedules, but we still need a few volunteers to run\
  \ Pathfinder Playtest demos in the Exhibition Hall and some scenarios in the Organized\
  \ Play room. We have a few hotel spaces left for out-of-town volunteers. If you\
  \ are interested in volunteering, we still have a few spaces available. To sign\
  \ up, complete the <a href=\"https://goo.gl/forms/Winpf95cZt55SPJC2\">volunteer\
  \ questionnaire</a>.</p> \n    <p>For players, there are still a few seats available\
  \ for pre-registration on warhorn.net . To facilitate both advance signups and onsite\
  \ attendees, we allocated the first 4 seats at every table to warhorn, with seats\
  \ 5&amp;6 available for signup onsite daily from 8 am. Visit <a href=\"https://warhorn.net/events/paizo-org-play-pax-unplugged\"\
  >https://warhorn.net/events/paizo-org-play-pax-unplugged</a> to register for games.</p>\
  \ \n    <h2>Convention Listing</h2> \n    <p>Want to attend a convention in the\
  \ next few months? Check out the list below! The list includes all the event support\
  \ requests received to date. If you see one missing, ping the organizer and have\
  \ them submit a request for support or have them email me at <a href=\"mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com\"\
  >organizedplay@paizo.com</a>to discuss their event. All of the conventions on the\
  \ list maintain some type of web presence, be it website, social media page, or\
  \ Warhorn listing, so if you are interested in attending in either capacity, check\
  \ out their websites or contact the local venture-officer for more information!</p>\
