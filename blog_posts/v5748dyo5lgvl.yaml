  > \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Back in November, the <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety\"\
  >Pathfinder Society</a> team met for <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lgqn\">a marathon\
  \ meeting</a> to discuss campaign changes that would improve the organized play\
  \ campaign by making it easier to prepare, run, and play scenarios. Rather than\
  \ unleash a huge number of changes all at once, I have been introducing these changes\
  \ gradually over the course of several months, and the recent December scenarios\
  \ are a good way to check in and observe the progress toward these goals.</p> \n\
  \    <h2>Lower Reference Count</h2> \n    <p>The goal is to reduce the number of\
  \ referenced hardcover books to four per scenario, including the <a href=\"/products/btpy88yj\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</em></a>. I definitely got close to that with\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9a1y\"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #6-10: The Wounded\
  \ Wisp</em></a>, which had five listed sources; I admit having to exceed this metric\
  \ here just because the replayable scenario has a much longer roster of monsters\
  \ and therefore references three Bestiaries, though a GM can run the adventure using\
  \ only one. <a href=\"/products/btpy9a1z\"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #6-11:\
  \ The Slave Master's Mirror</em></a> also has five (upon further review, I cut the\
  \ <em>Pathfinder RPG NPC Codex</em> reference), but in a way there are only four\
  \ such books required. Why? Keep reading.</p> \n    <h2>Bestiary References</h2>\
  \ \n    <p>Another goal is to provide an appendix that includes all <em>Bestiary</em>\
  \ and <em>NPC Codex</em> stat blocks, making it less of a burden for a GM to bring\
  \ all of the necessary references to a game and prepare the adventure. As always,\
  \ <em>The Wounded Wisp</em> is a strange exception just because of the randomized\
  \ encounter tables, so the adventure includes the necessary stat blocks for at least\
  \ one option in each encounter. <em>The Slave Master's Mirror</em> includes full\
  \ pages from the gnoll chapter of the <a href=\"/products/btpy9926\">Monster Codex</a>,\
  \ which is a fair representation of what we'll see in scenarios in the future. </p>\n\
  \    <h2>Scenario Length</h2> \n    <p>The third and final goal that I want to address\
  \ is scenario length, which has gradually become longer and longer over time. We\
  \ didn't publish any Tier 5-9 or 7-11 scenarios last month, so it's a little early\
  \ to start counting encounters to see if I truly began reducing the number. Nonetheless,\
  \ I paid special attention to <em>The Slave Master's Mirror</em>, a Tier 3-7 scenario,\
  \ to ensure the types and number of encounters it contains were conducive to completing\
  \ the adventure in around four hours. Next month we'll see <a href=\"/products/btpy9am5\"\
  >the first Tier 7-11 adventure of 2015</a>, and we'll put the revised scenario writing\
  \ guidelines to the test.</p> \n    <p>John Compton<br> <em>Developer</em></p> \n\
