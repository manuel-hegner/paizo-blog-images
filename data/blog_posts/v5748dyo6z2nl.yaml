  \ This was my first Pathfinder assignment for Paizo, though my contribution to <em>Curtain\

  \ jester, and puppeteer Performers! My thought going in was “performers have many\
  \ faces,” so I'd love for you to bring those many sides to your table. If you liked\
  \ my work here, then you might enjoy checking out some more of my writing in <em>Howl\
  \ of the Wild</em>, or some of my personal and collaborative work at my website\

  \ Thank you for checking out the <em>NPC Core</em> and happy rolls!</p>\n      <br>\n\
  \      <h3>Jamie Trollope (he/him)</h3>\n      <p>Hi! I'm Jamie Trollope, a researcher\
  \ and writer who’s been playing and GMing TTRPGs for over 30 years. I’ve written\
  \ for various third-party products, including the NPC Index line, and was lucky\
  \ enough to get to work on <em>NPC Core</em>. Getting to write about halflings was\
  \ a real joy—storytelling and food are two of my greatest loves, so it felt like\
  \ the perfect match. I'm incredibly grateful to have been part of this project and\
  \ to have worked alongside so many talented people.</p>\n      <br>\n      <h3>Ruvaid\
  \ Virk (he/him)</h3>\n      <p>Heyo! I'm Ruvaid (he/him) a real-life NPC that happens\
  \ to write for Paizo sometimes. You might know me from some of my previous work\
  \ such as the bloodrager archetype from <em>War of Immortals</em>, Hongal's entry\
  \ in <em>Tian Xia World Guide</em>, the vishkanya ancestry from <em>Impossible Lands</em>,\
  \ or the Starfinder horror bounty <em>Echoes of Woe</em>. For this cool book, I\
  \ worked on the themed spell lists section, to provide your NPC spellcasters some\
  \ fun thematic flair. If you like, you can follow me on Blue Sky <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/darthruvaider.bsky.social\"\
  >@darthruvaider.bsky.social</a> for any future updates. Cheers, and happy gaming!</p>\n\

  \ Wang (he/him)</h3>\n      <p>Hello, I'm Grady Wang and one of the cofounders of\
  \ the Gallant Goblin, a TTRPG review channel and publisher. I've had the honor to\
  \ write for Tian Xia, Season of Ghosts, and Spore War, as well as for the Infinite\
  \ Masters program on Pathfinder Infinite, developing products such as the <em>Queerfinder</em>series\
  \ and <em>Rare Ancestries: Ifrit Genies</em>. I was thrilled to contribute the kobold\
  \ section for <em>NPC Core</em>, as I love these scheming little reptiles in all\
  \ their forms. The chaos they can unleash with traps and pets makes them so fun\
  \ to add to any game. But if you just want to cuddle them, we also make kobold plushies\
  \ at <a href=\"https://koboldplush.com\">https://koboldplush.com</a>!</p>\n    \
  \  <br>\n      <h3>Andrew White</h3>\n      <p>Hi, I’m Andrew White! You may remember\
  \ me from other cool Paizo things like <em>Secrets of Magic</em>, <em>Guns &amp;\
  \ Gears</em>, <em>Book of the Dead</em>, <em>Rage of Elements</em>, <em>Howl of\
  \ the Wild</em>, and being the Digital Products Lead here at Paizo! For this particular\
  \ project, I had a blast (pun not intended, but now that I see it, I’m leaving it\
  \ in) writing up a whole bunch of bomb-throwing hobgoblin and steampunky engineer\
  \ entries, including two of my favorite fantasy archetypes: “dangerous lunatic in\
  \ power armor with freeze ray” and “even more dangerous lunatic who flies around\
  \ with the help of a tank of explosive rocket fuel strapped to their back”. You\
  \ can find me reposting smarter, funnier people on Bluesky at <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/plaguecontrol.bsky.social\"\
  >@plague control.bsky.social</a>.</p>\n      <br>\n      <h3>Basil Wright (he/they/xe)</h3>\n\
  \      <p>Hi, I'm Basil (he/they/xe). Most people know I'm a lover of scoundrels,\
  \ so it makes sense that I ended up making some fun criminals for this book. I wanted\
  \ to harness my inner crimeboy while making these characters, and I really hope\
  \ you can feel the seediness as you read. This was a really fun project to work\
  \ on, and I hope everyone has fun playing. You can find more of my work on my website\
