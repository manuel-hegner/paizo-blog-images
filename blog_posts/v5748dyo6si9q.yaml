  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Creating a dangerous dungeon\
  \ to challenge adventurers is a lot of work. While the various architecture aeons,\
  \ drafter devils, engineering elementals, and other dungeon designing minions here\
  \ at Paizo are generally great at their job, there are some times when the rooms\
  \ they create don’t quite hit the mark. While we typically just set those aside\
  \ for incineration at a later date, we were running out of space at the delving\
  \ warehouse. To clear up a bit of space, we figured that we could just set a few\
  \ of those unused rooms out on the curb for anyone to pick up. So, today on April\
  \ Fools’ Day, we invite you to come on by and grab any of these rooms and throw\
  \ them into your next dungeon!</p> \n     <p><b>Rooms Designed by Cosmo Eisele (Director\
  \ of Sales), Vanessa Hoskins (Developer), and Luis Loza (Creative Director)</b></p>\

  \  <br> \n     <h3>Chamber of Bouncing</h3> \n     <p>This large chamber looks inconspicuous\
  \ at first glance. There are open doorways at either end of the chamber. The floor\
  \ and walls of the room are magically enchanted to forcibly bounce creatures that\
  \ come in contact with them. A creature that moves through the room finds itself\
  \ springing and bouncing around. Every time the creature moves 5 feet, they are\
  \ bounced 10 feet in the same direction. This bouncing doesn’t count against the\
  \ creature’s movement. Creatures that collide against a wall are bounced back 10\
  \ feet in the opposite direction. Alternate versions of these chambers include trapped\
  \ doorways that magically move along the length of the walls, making it difficult\
  \ to reach an exit while bouncing around, or glass walls within the room that are\
  \ effectively invisible to the naked eye and serve to block the bouncing in the\
  \ chamber.</p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Crawler’s Room</h3> \n     <p>This room contains\
  \ a miniaturized version of the very building in which it’s located. The miniature\
  \ building takes up the entirety of the room, blocking access to the door on the\
  \ opposite of the chamber. The miniature’s doorways are large enough for a person\
  \ to crawl inside. Creatures that enter the room are subject to a magically-enhanced\
  \ gravity, causing the creatures to collapse to the ground. Reaching the other side\
  \ of the room requires crawling through the building replica and traversing the\
  \ miniaturized dungeon. The miniature version of this room doesn’t contain its own\
  \ miniature and is instead filled with small piles of treasures.</p> \n     <br>\
  \ \n     <h3>Grand Sycamore Ballroom</h3> \n     <p>This vast chamber is large enough\
  \ to contain a legion. Hanging high on the walls, out of the reach of most, are\
  \ massive tapestries displaying legendary heroes, each standing thrice as tall as\
  \ they would appear in life. The room is filled with a carefully positioned pattern\
  \ of round tables, each surrounded by eight chairs, and sporting different colored\
  \ adornments, arranged in broad sections. In the center of the room, against the\
  \ far wall, stands a magnificent stage. A long table at the front edge of the stage\
  \ has four chairs for the Grand Coordinator and their closest officers. Several\
  \ double doors exit the room on all four sides.</p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Helpful\
  \ Warning Room</h3> \n     <p>This 10-foot-by-20-foot room has a packed dirt floor\
  \ and unlocked wooden doors at both ends. In the center of the room there is a long\
  \ gash cut through the dirt, and a notched and rusty shield stuck into the floor\
  \ in the exact center of the gouge and room. Scrawled upon the shield, in an obviously\
  \ unskilled hand, is the word “TRAP!” written in red paint with an arrow pointing\
  \ straight up. Following the arrow up shows an enormous greataxe attached to the\
  \ ceiling and rigged to swing through the room when a barely concealed tripwire\
  \ is tripped. This obviously is the source of the gouge, and the swinging axe is\
  \ easily avoided when the trap is tripped. Upon closer inspection, there is another\
  \ scrawled word on the head of the axe itself in the same red paint: “BOOM!” This\
  \ word is painted on top of a <em>fireball rune</em> (<em>Core Rulebook</em> 524),\
  \ which goes off when the axe head swings within 20 feet of the party.</p> \n  \
  \   <br> \n     <h3>Visualizer Chamber</h3> \n     <p>The walls of this room are\
  \ decorated with colorful artwork. All objects and creatures within the room have\
  \ their appearance drastically altered, resembling stylized artwork that’s made\
  \ up of small groupings of black, cyan, magenta, and yellow dots. Anytime a creature\
  \ would speak or make some other sound within this chamber, the sound doesn’t occur\
  \ normally. Instead, a large image of the words or sound effect appears in the air\
  \ near the creature. This alteration to appearance and sound doesn’t prevent creatures\
  \ from acting normally, casting spells, and so on. </p> \n    </blockquote> \n \
