  artist: "all but the truly desperate, as they represent the openings to a vast and\
    \ complex series of ankheg nests. For the most part, the warring ankheg armies\
    \ are content to battle each other in their leagues of underground tunnels, noticeable\
    \ to those above only as a low buzzing, though foolhardy travelers might occasionally\
    \ witness a colony raising a new mound entrance with frightening speed and efficiency.\
    \ Every few years, however, runoff"
