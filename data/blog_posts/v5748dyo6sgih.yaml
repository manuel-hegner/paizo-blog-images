  \ the lovely countdown to what I like to call \"Convention Season\" which, for the\
  \ Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild, really kicks off at <a href=\"http://originsgamefair.com/\"\
  >Origins</a>. Luckily, February's scenarios also provide an excellent new recruitment\
  \ option to our GMs in the field, and a scenario that continues a plotline many\
  \ players have (rather vocally) expressed interest in. So, how about we dig into\
  \ this month's scenarios!</p> \n     <p><i><a href=\"/products/btq01wlg?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-132-Acts-of-Association\"\
  >Starfinder Society #1-32: Acts of Association</a></i>, like many scenarios, is\
  \ the brainchild of a conversation Organized Play Lead Developer John Compton and\
  \ I had during the course of a meeting. The Starfinder Society runs missions on\
  \ far-off planets all the time, so it stands to reason that they would need to negotiate\
  \ contracts and treaties to allow for such exploration, right? This month's first\
  \ scenario is a repeatable scenario that delves into what the Society needs to do\
  \ to secure some of those agreements. With randomized missions and a randomized\
  \ visiting dignitary, <i>Acts of Association</i> provides a whole lot of replayability\
  \ and what I expect to be even more memorable stories as a result of these randomized\
  \ elements. Written by rising freelancer, Scott Young (who also wrote <i><a href=\"\
  /products/btpya1y2?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-1003-Death-On-The-Ice\">Pathfinder\
  \ Society #10-03: Death on the Ice</a></i> and contributed to <a href=\"/products/btpy9zjz?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-916-Fallen-Family-Broken-Name\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Society #9-16: Fallen Family, Broken Name</i></a>) I suspect this\
  \ scenario is going to be the cause of a lot of stories that I'll be hearing about\
  \ in the upcoming \"Convention Season.\"</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb180\">\n \
  \     <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/StarfinderSociety/20190222-HiraLanzio.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/StarfinderSociety/20190222-HiraLanzio_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Our second February scenario, <a href=\"/products/btq01wlk?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-133-Data-Breach\"\
  ><i>Starfinder Society #1-33: Data Breach</i></a>, brings us back to an investigation\
  \ that's been happening all season long. Players and GMs alike may want to brush\
  \ up on the events of <a href=\"/products/btpy9x0w?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-107-The-Solar-Sortie\"\
  ><i>Starfinder Society #1-07: The Solar Sortie</i></a> and <a href=\"/products/btpy9zjx?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-114-Star-Sugar-Heartlove\"\
  ><i>Starfinder Society #1-14: Star Sugar Heartlove!!!</i></a> before tackling <i>Data\
  \ Breach</i>, which follows the ongoing investigation into a conspiracy against\
  \ the Society. Written by Pathfinder Adventure Path and scenario veteran alike,\
  \ Jim Groves (who has a bibliography too long for me to link), I was astonished\
  \ at some of the excellent encounter mechanics included in this scenario. For players\
  \ who want a different type of scenario challenge, all taking place with the backdrop\
  \ of breaking into a high-security data facility, Jim's got you covered! On a more\
  \ personal note, it's been great to see some of the story arcs coming together,\
  \ and I am exceptionally excited to see the reactions of players after playing this\
  \ scenario as it leads into the upcoming <a href=\"/products/btq01x4y?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-138-The-Many-Minds-of-Historia\"\
  ><i>Starifnder Society #1-38: The Many Minds of Historia</i></a>.</p> \n     <p>That\
  \ about does it for February's releases. Stay tuned in the coming weeks as we begin\
  \ to reveal more Starfinder Society information, as well as more scenario previews.\
  \ I have it on good authority that next month we'll be getting a much better look\
  \ at our good friends, the jinsuls. I've also heard that the Starfinder Society,\
  \ specifically one Radaszam, might have come into possession of a treasure map that\
  \ needs some following up onâ€¦</p> \n     <p>Until next time,</p> \n     <p>Thurston\
