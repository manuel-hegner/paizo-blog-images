  \ Loot!</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, July 17, 2012</p> \n    <p>Rumor has\
  \ it that everyone, both players and GMs, love to get their hands on new gear. From\
  \ the new sword that would be perfect for your PC—or even better in the hands of\
  \ a villain—to a wizard’s staff, gear and magic items have always been an exciting\
  \ part of the game. Fortunately for all those treasure seekers out there, we’re\
  \ just five weeks away from Gen Con and the release <a href=\"/products/btpy8tmc\"\
  ><i>Ultimate Equipment</i></a>, the next exciting hardcover book for the Pathfinder\
  \ Roleplaying Game.</p> \n    <p>The new toys in this book are divided up into a\
  \ series of handy chapters, starting with nonmagical weapons, armor, and gear. The\
  \ book then moves on to present endless pages on new magic items, from rods, staves,\
  \ and rings, to artifacts and intelligent items. This mighty tome contains more\
  \ wondrous items than any other book in the Pathfinder library, conveniently divided\
  \ up by the slot that it occupies.</p> \n    <p>Over the next five weeks, we are\
  \ going to be looking at some of the items in this book, but instead of just showing\
  \ off a few spreads, I thought this would be a great excuse to take a look at the\
  \ random treasure generation system found in the appendix. Each week, I’ll use the\
  \ system to generate a few pieces of treasure for you to drool over. This week,\
  \ we’re going to start out with something simple: the treasure trove of a goblin\
  \ tribe. Assuming the entire tribe is approximately a CR 5 encounter, we’ve got\
  \ 2,300 gp worth of loot to assign. Since goblins are humanoids, they can have a\
  \ wide variety of treasure types, so we are going to go with Treasure Type D: Coins\
  \ and Small objects. As you can see, this table has a variety of entries for me\
  \ to choose from, but to equal 2,300 gp, I’m going to take a 2,000 gp entry and\
  \ a 300 gp entry. I could mix it up with some other tables as well, but I’m going\
  \ to keep it simple this week. Rolling up the two entries, I get the following:</p>\
  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><b>2,000 gp Reward (total value 1,910 gp)</b><br>\
  \ 60 gp, 5 pp, <i>potion of levitate, scroll of hydraulic torrent,</i> and a <i>scroll\
  \ of mass cure light wounds</i></p> \n     <p><b>300 gp Reward (total value 482\
  \ gp)</b><br> 40 sp, 28 gp, <i>potion of bull’s strength</i>, and a <i>scroll of\
  \ flaming sphere</i></p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Each reward gives the GM a\
  \ series of additional rolls to make in the appendix and throughout the rest of\
  \ the book to determine treasure to assign for the encounter. If I instead wanted\
  \ a bunch of minor treasures, I could have bought four 500 gp rewards and one 300\
  \ gp reward. The result would have been a lot more coins and lower-priced items.\
  \ You might notice that my 300 gp reward came out a bit over, while the 2,000 gp\
  \ reward ended up a bit under (with the total coming out at 2,392 gp). The system\
  \ is balanced so that over time, most of your treasure rolls should average out\
  \ to give the party the right amount of treasure. </p> \n    <p>Well, that about\
  \ wraps up this week. Now that we’ve covered some of the basics, next week we’ll\
  \ be fighting a trio of vengeful mummies to see what loot they might have, and will\
  \ be taking a look at some of the brand new items you can find in this book.</p>\
