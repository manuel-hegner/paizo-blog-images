  artist: "Jan Knappert. In the pages of this reference guide, sandwiched between\
    \ the entries for Jilani and Jiris (the Arabic form of the name George, apparently),\
    \ is a fairly long explanation of jinns. Knappert explains that in Islamic countries,\
    \ spirits are divided among jinns, shaytans, ifrits, and marids, and that in Ancient\
    \ Persia some jinns and other evil spirits were referred to as div (which also\
    \ have a role as a new breed of fiends in Legacy of Fire). The entry goes on to\
    \ illustrate examples of genies"
