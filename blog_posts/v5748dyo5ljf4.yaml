  \ Back Again</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Friday, December 30, 2016</p> \n   <div\
  \ itemprop=\"articlebody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Only another day remains\
  \ of 2016, and in these last 360-some-odd days, we've released almost 100 new products\
  \ into the world! Ranging from rulebooks to classic adventures, character reference\
  \ and card game action, the year has been jam-packed with new and exciting projects\
  \ for Paizo. Let's take a look at some of the highlights!</p> \n    <p>A world of\
  \ intrigue holds endless possibilities! This year the new vigilante character class\
  \ was added to the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game lineup, as well other subtle and\
  \ devious gameplay options, in <a href=\"/products/btpy9j6p\"><em>Ultimate Intrigue</em></a>,\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9l37\"><em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Inner Sea Intrigue</em></a>,\
  \ and <a href=\"/products/btpy9l2w\"><em>Pathfinder Player Companion: Spymaster's\
  \ Handbook</em></a>. And to challenge your cunning heroes, we provided a library\
  \ of foes to drop into your encounters with the <a href=\"/products/btpy9oo7\"><em>Villain\
  \ Codex</em></a>!</p> \n    <p>Speaking of foes... what about your PCs? Some of\
  \ you took up the opportunity to be the bad guys in this year's <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/hellsVengeance\"\
  >Hell's Vengeance Adventure Path</a>, where each character had the role of being\
  \ an evil character in the diabolical empire of Cheliax.</p> \n    <p>If you weren't\
  \ down with Thrune, perhaps your group made the decision to test their sanity in\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9nfu\"><em>Pathfinder Module: Gallows of Madness</em></a>,\
  \ or our current Adventure Path, <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/strangeAeons\"\
  >Strange Aeons</a>? We've unleashed a number of terrifying options in this summer's\
  \ hardcover release <a href=\"/products/btpy9n5a\"><em>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game:\
  \ Horror Adventures</em></a>, as well as <a href=\"/products/btpy9op8\"><em>Horror\
  \ Realms</em></a> and the <a href=\"/products/btpy9nft\"><em>Haunted Heroes Handbook</em></a>.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>And, if that weren't enough, we decided to revisit an old classic and\
  \ update <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/curseOfTheCrimsonThrone\">Curse of\
  \ the Crimson Throne</a> in a new hardcover edition! This fan-favorite rereleased\
  \ with new gorgeous artwork, is now compatible with the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game,\
  \ and has a number of additions that make it a gem for any roleplaying game collection.\
  \ This wasn't the only adventure we decided to make the trek back for, though! Pathfinder\
  \ Adventure Card Game fans have begun to journey through the sands in <a href=\"\
  /pathfinder/adventureCardGame\">Mummy's Mask</a>!</p> \n    <p>With this many projects,\
  \ 2016 had something for everyone! Other releases included: Pocket Editions of the\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9kfe\"><em>Pathfinder Core Rulebook</em></a> and <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9pl4\"><em>Bestiary</em></a>, RPG Superstar winning modules <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9j6u\"><em>Down the Blighted Path</em></a> and <a href=\"/products/btpy9op2\"\
  ><em>Seers of the Drowned City</em></a>, as well as new and old discoveries in <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy9ng0\"><em>Planes of Power</em></a> and <a href=\"/products/btpy9op9\"\
  ><em>The First World, Realm of the Fey</em></a>.</p> \n    <p>Don't worry, I didn't\
  \ forget, a new chapter began this year with the announcement of the <a href=\"\
  /starfinder\">Starfinder Roleplaying Game</a>! While we don't have anything new\
  \ to show off right this moment, be sure to keep your eyes out in the coming months\
  \ and get ready for Starfinder's launch in August 2017.</p> \n    <div class=\"\
