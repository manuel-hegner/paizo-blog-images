  ></a>\n       <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\"></p>\n      </div> \n      <h3>Entu\
  \ Colony</h3> \n      <blockquote> \n       <p>Entu colonies begin their life cycle\
  \ as a collection of minuscule spores. Over time, the spores fuse together through\
  \ intricate networks of mycelia that function similarly to neurons, creating sapient\
  \ and mobile fungal colonies. These structures generate conscious thought and obtain\
  \ sensory information about the colony’s environment.</p> \n       <p>In their first\
  \ weeks of life, entu spores gradually coalesce into amorphous pools of opalescent\
  \ slime with malleable pseudopod-like organs. At this stage, colonies can communicate\
  \ telepathically with other creatures using a lexicon of sensory and emotional concepts.\
  \ Entu colonies can reproduce asexually once they reach maturity, typically six\
  \ months after they first sprout mycelia. Most of the resulting spores integrate\
  \ into the parent colony, but some may split off to form a separate colony.</p>\
  \ \n       <p>Thought not parasitic, entu colonies feed on emotion and thought.\
  \ In fact, some seek to consensually merge with other sentient creatures rather\
  \ than form into full-fledged and independent colonies. Instead of harming their\
  \ host, an entu fungus’s adaptable cells mimic the host’s brain and nerve tissue.\
  \ Their mycelia intertwine with their host’s central nervous system, creating new\
  \ synapses and enhancing sections of the host’s brain. Despite inhabiting the host’\
  s body, the entu fungus retains a separate consciousness which intertwines with\
  \ its host through shared functional memories and sensory input. The resultant symbiotic\
  \ life-form, called an entu symbiote, eventually attains self-awareness, complex\
  \ thought, and even linguistic ability. Entu integration can sometimes result in\
  \ entu symbiotes’ offspring already being seeded with the fungal life integrated\
  \ into their bodies and brains; this development has led to the “uplifting” of entire\
  \ species of previously non-sapient animals.</p> \n       <p>The nelentu, one of\
  \ the founding species of the Kreiholm Freehold, is a prominent example of a successful\
  \ symbiosis that spans generations. Originally a species of bat-like animals called\
  \ neleks that evolved on Agillae-2, these once unintelligent, fruit-eating creatures\
  \ encountered entu spores early in their evolution and willingly became their hosts.\
  \ The two species formed a society based on this symbiosis. Today, nelentus inhabit\
  \ tiered jungle-cities built around green spaces, known as Gardens of Thought, where\
  \ they cultivate entu spores for future generations. Nelentus consider themselves\
  \ to be one species, referring to themselves and other nelentus using plural pronouns\
  \ in deference to their dual nature.</p> \n       <p>Entu fungi of all kinds seek\
  \ constant exposure to emotion and thought to thrive, and those involved with symbiotes\
  \ prioritize their hosts’ physical needs. They prefer to enter symbiotic relationships\
  \ with creatures who can benefit from their cellular mimicry, living as long as\
  \ the host creature does—and dying along with it. Entu colonies, on the other hand,\
  \ can survive for up to 300 years.</p> \n      </blockquote> \n      <p>The entu\
  \ are two-playable-races-in-one!</p> \n      <blockquote> \n       <h3>Entu Colonies</h3>\
  \ \n       <p><b>Ability Adjustments</b>: +2 Int, +2 Cha, –2 Str<br> <b>Hit Points</b>:\
  \ 2<br> <b>Size and Type</b>: Entu colonies are Small oozes. Amorphous: An entu\
  \ colony has the amorphous universal creature rule (page 152).<br> Entu Colony Senses:\
  \ An entu colony has blindsight (emotion) with a range of 60 feet.<br> Limited Ooze\
  \ Benefits: See page 34.<br> Limited Telepathy: Entu colonies have limited telepathy\
  \ with a range of 30 feet. Tactical Symbiosis: See page 34.<br></p> \n       <h3>Entu\
  \ Symbiotes</h3> \n       <p><b>Ability Adjustments</b>: +2 Int<br> <b>Hit Points</b>:\
  \ 4<br> <b>Size and Type</b>: Entu symbiotes are Small, Medium, or Large animals\
  \ with the entu symbiote subtype. Entu Symbiote Senses: An entu symbiote has blindsense\
  \ (emotion) with a range of 30 feet and low-light vision.<br> <b>Extrasensory Perception</b>:\
  \ The mycelia integrated into an entu symbiote’s nervous system allow them to perceive\
  \ ambient thoughts and emotion. They gain a +2 racial bonus to Perception and Sense\
  \ Motive checks.<br> <b>Limited Augmentations</b>: The only augmentations that can\
  \ be installed in an entu symbiote’s brain are datajacks and the mechanic’s custom\
  \ rig.<br> <b>Limited Telepathy</b>: Entu symbiotes have limited telepathy with\
  \ a range of 30 feet.<br> <b>Natural Weapons</b>: Entu symbiotes have the natural\
  \ weapons universal creature rule with a kinetic damage type chosen at character\
  \ creation.<br> <b>Symbiotic Enhancement</b>: At character creation, an entu symbiote\
  \ chooses a fly speed (Ex, average), burrow speed, climb speed, or swim speed, matching\
  \ thematically the type of animal on which the entu symbiote is based. The entu\
  \ symbiote has that speed with a value of 20 feet.<br></p> \n      </blockquote>\
