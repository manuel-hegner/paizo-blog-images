                     2 to 4 players take turns to draft and play colorful (and colorblind-friendly) hexagonal tiles to match specific patterns and meet their own secret objective. With several dozen pattern cards, variable objectives, and a game state that's constantly in flux, you'll never play the same way twice. Simple setup, easy-to-learn rules, and a short play time of around 30 minutes means there's always time for one more game…</p>

                   <p>Pathfinder and Starfinder Infinite is a program that allows you to create content (adventures and locations; monsters; character classes, archetypes, and backgrounds; fiction; etc.) based on Paizo’s intellectual property (IP), including Pathfinder’s Lost Omens campaign setting, and to make some money while you’re at it. Your work might even be recognized by the community and earn you an invitation into the Infinite Masters elite creator program.</p>

                   <p>Titles are ranked by an average of units sold and revenue earned and presented in alphabetical order. Asterisks indicate titles that have been on a best-seller list previously. Because they’ve consistently topped the list, and due to the number of their titles that typically take up spots, “Team+” and “Team Index” have asked to be removed from the calculations for ongoing top performers lists. This will allow newer publishers or book series to get more attention. Thanks, all!</p>

                   <p>The <em>Monstercology Galatica</em> is an attempt to catalog and describe all of the many and varied creatures that we share the galaxy with. We understand that with millions of stars and billions of worlds—plus those that visit the galaxy from other planes—this is a nearly impossible endeavor.

                   <p>A certain type of adventurer resides in the vast frontiers of space—wayfarers and drifters, hunters whose next meal rides on their cunning, their aim, and the price on their bounty's head. They carve out their existence beyond the fringes of civilization; the easy life is as alien to them as another man's gun, and just as fickle. They prefer the unpredictable and uncharted, far from prying eyes and folks what ask too many questions. Never tied to one place, these vagabonds stay strange and savvy, doing what they can to keep alive. When the galaxy needs a job done, they call for the rough and tumble space cowboy.</p>

Inside, you’ll find a spread of the latest mech creations of the Outer Sphere, deadly carnivorous mechform mimics, oozes that can slip inside a mech to throttle the operator or take over the machine entirely, and more. This book provides a variety of themed threats for use in mech combat at all levels of play, and all mechs within were made in accordance with the recommended alternative rules for creating NPC mechs from&nbsp;<em>Starfinder Tech Revolution</em>.&nbsp;</p>

                   <p>We’ve also got another Starfinder Bounty for all of you</p>
                   <p>Aucturn isn’t usually a great place to set up shop, but some corporations see the complete lack of regulations as a plus. When things go wrong, though, it’s up to “independent contractors” to deal with the issues. That’s you. Things have gone wrong, and Agent Bright, a representative of the Clearbright Institute of Discovery, a corporate conglomerate shrouded in mystery, contacts the PCs with an offer. It’ll be up to you to see if various deeds done on Aucturn ever see the light of day. This will likely be the first time on Aucturn for most of you, but I wouldn’t recommend taking in the sights.</p>

                   <p>Hello, Pathfinders and welcome to the new year!</p>
                   <p>This month is a double feature of scenarios, so buckle up!</p>
                   <p>First, the Pathfinder Society is paying Valashinaz a favor by traveling to an old temple that used to be a place of worship for her, but has since been abandoned after a terrible tempest! The Pathfinders will need to travel to her temple and collect the large collection of skymetals that were left as offerings long ago, while making sure that they don’t anger the spirits that still linger on the island. The Pathfinders have been warned that there may be akatas on the island, but since there aren’t any inhabitants, they should all be hibernating, right?</p>
                   <p>...right?</p>

                   <p>During those misadventures, the Pathfinder Society will also be sending a group of junior agents to attend and poke around a high-society auction in Niswan, in the hopes of collecting more information about the mysterious Benefactor that appeared at the end of the last year. It should be a night of elbow-rubbing, delicious pink chai, and gawking at fancy baubles; however, it wouldn’t be a party with Pathfinders if nothing went wrong! It seems that the auction may be attended by some partygoers that have no plans to pay for their treasures!</p>

                   <h2>Design Goals</h2>
                   <p>Overall, monsters were working well statistically and thematically, so there weren’t any changes to the basics of how monsters work. Instead, we focused on making the book gorgeous, expansive, and full of great monsters! We had several big goals for <em>Monster Core</em>.</p>
                   <p><strong>Match the Remaster Rules:</strong> We adjusted monster rules that needed to match new terminology or rules. For instance, changing “negative healing” to “void healing,” using “Reactive Strike,” and swapping out spells that were in <em>Core Rulebook</em>, but not <em>Player Core</em>.</p>
                   <p><strong>Collect the Greatest Hits:</strong> The most classic monsters mingle with new creations! This book is focused on creatures that you can use over and over in all sorts of games. Most creatures came over from the first <em>Bestiary</em>, with some updates. But we also graduated some monsters that appeared in <em>Bestiary 2</em> and <em>Bestiary 3</em> to the main monster book, including serpentfolk, herexens, marsh and shadow giants, phantoms, scarecrows, and more! Monster Core also brings several Pathfinder First Edition monsters into Second Edition, including bogwids and the sargassum heap (formerly sargassum fiend).</p>
                   <p><strong>Replace Some OGL Monsters:</strong> We cut several creatures that we were using from the OGL as we move to the ORC license and a set of creatures more specific to Pathfinder and Golarion. Where possible, we put in creatures that fill a similar role in adventure-building. For example, the sargassum heap mentioned above replaces another lurking 6th-level plant creature! We’ve also created exciting new devils, dragons, and other new threats in classic categories.</p>
                   <p><strong>Match the Mythology:</strong> For a great many creatures that originated in folklore, their abilities and look were based on sources like pulp novels and TV shows. Eleanor Ferron spearheaded an effort to take creatures like rakshasa, oni, dragon turtles, and coatls closer to their source material. Making them more authentic while ensuring they still match Golarion’s lore was a massive undertaking!</p>
                   <p><strong>Pack it Full!:</strong> Lastly, we wanted to include as many monsters as we could reasonably fit. Variety makes for memorable campaigns, adventures, and encounters, so getting more monsters in the book was great. The book is longer than the first <em>Bestiary,</em> but beyond that, we fit more stat blocks into several sections—dinosaurs have the same number of pages, but 10 creatures instead of seven.</p>
                   <p>There were also some changes that weren’t primary goals. Low-level monsters had high AC too often, and Michael Sayre did a pass to make the low-level experience more even. There wasn’t a level –1 plant or fungus for <em>summon plant or fungus</em>, so Landon Winkler made the sprigjack, a weaker twigjack.</p>
                   <br>
                   <h2>Wrap Battle</h2>
                   <p>On streams and other previews, we’ve talked quite a bit about hags, devils, and other monsters that had pretty big revisions. Let’s take a moment to go over an example of a smaller change. Mummies, beyond being classic horror monsters, make for great undead to include in musty tombs and dungeons. But the <em>Bestiary</em> version was primarily based on causing despair and imposing a rotting curse. They can be pretty static, so we were looking for something new to put into our basic mummies to make them more interesting, much like we reassessed them when creating new mummies for <em>Book of the Dead</em>.</p>
                   <p>Since the mummy guardian and mummy pharaoh were originally created with sophisticated chemical processes, we landed on an alchemical theme. You can see the special actions the mummy guardian can now use in combat, and how they reinforce the creature’s theme in a unique way!</p>

                   <h3>Mummy Guardian — Creature 6</h3>
                   <p>Medium, Mummy, Undead, Unholy<br><strong>Perception</strong> +16; darkvision<br><strong>Languages</strong> Necril, plus any one language they knew while alive<br><strong>Skills</strong> Athletics +15, Stealth +11<br><strong>Str</strong> +4, <strong>Dex</strong> +0, <strong>Con</strong> +2, <strong>Int</strong> –2, <strong>Wis</strong> +4, <strong>Cha</strong> +2<br><strong>AC</strong> 23; <strong>Fort</strong> +14, <strong>Ref</strong> +10, <strong>Will</strong> +16</p>
                   <p><strong>HP</strong> 125, void healing (page 360); <strong>Immunities</strong> bleed, death effects, disease, paralyzed, poison, unconscious; <strong>Weaknesses</strong> alchemical 5 (see alchemical weakness), fire 5</p>
                   <p><strong>Alchemical Weakness</strong> The guardian’s weakness to alchemical items not only applies to damage from alchemical items, but the guardian also takes 5 damage when splashed with non-damaging alchemical items or dosed with alchemical poisons, even if they’re immune to their other effects.</p>
                   <p><strong>Blighted Consumption</strong> [reaction] (curse, divine, poison) <strong>Trigger</strong> A creature within 30 feet eats or drinks (including an alchemical item or potion); <strong>Effect</strong> The food or drink burns like the caustic substances fed to the mummy before its death. If the creature fails a DC 24 Fortitude save, they become sickened 2 after they finish the consumption and can’t reduce their sickened condition while within 30 feet of any mummy.</p>
                   <p><strong>Speed</strong> 20 feet</p>
                   <p><strong>Melee</strong> [one-action] fist +16 (agile), <strong>Damage</strong> 2d10+7 bludgeoning plus Choking Pain</p>
                   <p><strong>Choking Pain</strong> [one-action] (divine, illusion, mental, void) <strong>Requirements</strong> The mummy’s last action was a successful fist Strike; <strong>Effect</strong>The mummy shares the pain of its dying moments with the target of that Strike. That creature takes 3d8 void damage with a DC 24 basic Will save. If the creature critically fails the saving throw, it can’t speak for 1 round, including to Cast a Spell.</p>
                   <br>

                   <p>Of course, we wouldn’t have been able to pull this off at all without having such an amazing group of authors working on the adventures and their support articles. So instead of dancing around spoilers and trying to figure out what to say about this final adventure without revealing too much, let’s hear from two of the authors for this book!</p>
                   <p>(A final note about the art I’m featuring in this blog post—none of it is technically from the adventure itself, but from support articles, so there shouldn’t be anything in these images that will particularly spoil things for anyone who’s eager to discover Season of Ghosts’ surprises as players!)</p>

                   <h3>Jeremy Blum</h3>
                   <p>I'm Jeremy Blum and my articles in Season of Ghosts volumes 3 and 4 will be my first published Paizo projects! For volume 3, I got the chance to flesh out nindorus based on James Jacobs' initial notes, and detailing the intricacies of a delicious new fiend variant was a blast. As for volume 4, let's just say that I was able to write up character options inspired by aspects of Buddhism. I look forward to seeing how players use them!</p>
                   <p>Aside from Season of Ghosts, I've penned portions of the upcoming <em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Tian Xia</em><em>World Guide</em> and <em>Tian Xia Character Guide</em>as well as <em>Pathfinder Howl of the Wild</em>. I've also designed Pathfinder conversions for the Korean-themed Undying Corruption setting by Nine Heavens Press, contributed lore to the Chinese-inspired Banner Clans faction in Three Sails Studios’ miniatures wargame <em>Margrave: The Marcher Lords</em>, and most recently worked on several Renegade Games Studios projects that are still under wraps. Check out my portfolio and feel free to follow me (I use the name Pixel Grotto on Twitter and Bluesky) to share stories of how nindorus have made your life miserable.</p>
                   <br>
                   <h3>Liane Merciel</h3>
                   <p>I was both super excited and nervous to be asked to contribute to this Adventure Path.</p>
                   <p>Like a lot of you, I have been a Forever GM for a... well, forever, basically. I think the last time I got to be a PC was, uh, 2006 maybe? No, wait, I did get to play Fumbus for 20 glorious minutes at PaizoCon 2019. So yeah, that’s the last time I was a player in a tabletop campaign.</p>
                   <p>Possibly because of this (vengeful? Me? Never!), my home campaigns are skewed heavily toward horror in all its many and glorious forms. If my players aren’t white-knuckling it and/or grossed out at least once per story arc, I believe that I have failed.</p>
                   <p>Trying to pull off a horror game as a published adventure, though, was a totally different kind of challenge. My GM’ing style is reactive: I see how the players respond to NPC X or Encounter Y and tailor the interaction accordingly. Writing an adventure for players I’ve never met, at tables I’ll never see, using a set of rules that was in flux at the time, was probably more terrifying than anything I’ve ever inflicted on my PCs.</p>
                   <p>But I look forward to putting them through the game later, just to make sure.</p>

                   <p>One final note: If you’re the kind of person who enjoys a good <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOHNx3GvTFbFjc9YQlm9OfybjLw7CZDzO">Adventure Path trailer</a> (that is, a person of culture and taste), you may have taken special notice of the music underscoring the visuals of our latest Season of Ghosts trailer. Those haunting melodies were composed by Filip Melvan of <a href="https://michaelghelfistudios.com/">Michael Ghelfi Studios</a>, with whom we’re excited to announce we’ve entered into an official partnership! Beginning with Season of Ghosts, Michael and his team of award-winning composers will be composing all-new original soundtracks uniquely tailored to accompany selected past and future Pathfinder Adventure Paths!</p>
                   <p>We’ll have plenty more to say in the weeks to come, but for the time being, we’ll leave it at this: players who like to incorporate music into their games can expect a lot of exciting auditory surprises in store!</p>
                   <p>Actually, you know what? That’s not fair. We can’t just tell you about this amazing music and not give you a sample to whet your appetite. <a href="https://downloads.paizo.com/mgs/01_Season_of_Ghosts.mp3">Here’s the title track</a> from the upcoming “Season of Ghosts” album right now, suitable for all your ghost-thwarting, village-protecting, below-the-web-blooming needs!</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 13px;">Here’s Jenny GMing for one of many amazing demo tables at PAXU!</p>
                   </div>
                   <br>
                   <p><b>PAXU Demo</b><br><b>Map</b>: <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02ee8">Starfinder Flip-Mat: Mining Operation</a><br><b>Character Level</b>: 3rd</p>
                   <p>The goal of this demo was to test out what we’ve been working on internally with a wider pool of players and see some early reactions from the community. I won’t be going into extreme detail about everything we tested in the demo, especially since some of those rules may have changed after we implemented feedback and prepared the Playtest Rulebook for the printer over the past two weeks! If you want the full experience, you’ll have to find me or one of my teammates at an upcoming convention or wait for the next batch of demos we’ll no doubt be cooking up for GenCon!</p>
                   <p>Players chose from the following premade characters:</p>
                   <ul>
                    <li>Envoy</li>
                    <li>Mystic</li>
                    <li>Operative</li>
                    <li>Solarian</li>
                   </ul>
                   <p><b>The Fight</b><br>
                     The players approached from the north of a seemingly abandoned mining site strewn with cranes, vehicles, crates, and other large objects providing that sweet, sweet cover. A massive pit in the center of the map created an obstacle for characters favoring melee combat styles. But these lucky gamers were playing a game that favors ranged combat (YEEHAW!) so they all had a ranged damage option in the form of guns! <em>Pew pew pew</em>! Even so, some attacks and abilities perform better in closer quarters. The solarian’s playstyle focuses on getting close to enemies and hitting them with powerful attacks from their solar weapons, and some of the mystic’s spells don’t work from too far away—so not everyone thought it was a good idea to camp out at the edge of the map behind the safety of cover. (Just the operative. Always. So tacticool.)</p>
                   <p>As the players investigated the mine, a trio of pirates popped out from behind cover and fired the first shots of the battle. These pirates were packing guns of their own—machine guns! This meant they could shoot from a distance or get close and unleash a rain of bullets on multiple targets with automatic fire. The pirates’ tactics were to shoot once from a distance, then move in and switch to spraying auto-fire to <em>pew pew </em>as many of their enemies as possible.</p>
                   <br>
                   <p><b>Tactics and Playtesting</b><br>
                     Changing the pirates’ tactics changed the encounter. I experimented with some different tactics and eventually settled into a routine of two pirates following their normal tactics, while a third perched behind a toolchest (cover) on top of the crane. Sometimes, it was like running two battles in one: a sniper fight between crane guy and the operative, and the chaos of machine gun space pirates versus everyone else. Other times, the players disrupted this setup—they gravity welled crane guy off his perch, attacked him with his own shadow, and more! Poor crane guy!</p>
                   <p>The point is, different groups always used different tactics. Patterns emerged, of course. Generally, the operative hung back and kept in cover while sniping, while the mystic slung spells and <em>pew pew</em>’d from a medium distance. Sometimes the mystic even got into melee and used their painglaive to share their emotions with the enemy on a more personal level. The solarian usually charged into battle, either going after the sniper (RIP crane guy) and using abilities to try to drag him off his perch or intercepting the gunners on their way toward the party. The envoy had a lot of choices between shooting and giving directives like Get in There! to boost everyone’s speed, or Kiss It Better to “heal” someone with temporary HP. No two groups I GM’d for used exactly the same combination of actions. Considering each premade character only contained a snapshot of the rules we’ll be playtesting later this year, you should expect a lot of fun choices when you build your first playtest characters.</p>
                   <p><strong>A Note About Pregens<br></strong> he StarFriends (as we members of the Starfinder team call ourselves) each designed one of the premade characters available for the demo. Dustin created the mystic, Jessica whipped up an envoy, Mike crafted a solarian, and Jenny built an operative. Thursty designed the encounter, so we gave the boss a pass this time!</p>
                   <div class="blurbCenter">
                    <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/1fb9c129-3dbc-4e28-9111-329326f96a10/PAXU2023_Crit.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/1fb9c129-3dbc-4e28-9111-329326f96a10/PAXU2023_Crit.jpg" width="80%" style="padding: 10px;" alt="A group of players sitting around a table at the PAX unplugged convention"></a>
                    <p style="font-size: 13px;">Here’s Jenny CRITTING that amazing demo table! Oh no!</p>
                   </div>
                   <br>
                   <p><strong>Bonus Encounter<br></strong> If the players ROFLstomped the pirates, say with a string of crits, the demo had a second encounter loaded in the chamber so the demo wouldn’t run disappointingly short. A fourth pirate gunner and his hacked robot ally emerged from a building and attacked the party right after they defeated the pirates. The robot advanced and went <em>pew pew pew </em>with its laser rifle while the pirate crept up behind it, using her hacked tank-bot as mobile cover until she reached spray-and-pray range. The robot might power down at half HP or use its healing nanites to keep fighting longer, depending on the group. Only a handful of groups played the bonus encounter, including the Cosmic Critters. More about that in a minute.</p>
                   <p><strong>A Veskmas Miracle<br></strong>Playing games with nufriends in the community is always a great time. Thanks to all you gamers at PAX: Unplugged who wandered over to the Paizo tables to try Starfinder 2. Thank you to the GMs who volunteered their time to run demo tables—y’all are some space badasses!</p>
                   <p>Speaking of space badasses, in addition to the public playtests, I had the honor of playing the demo with the wonderful casts of Atomless, Cosmic Crit, and No Quest for the Wicked. They really kept me on my toes with their rolls and roleplay. You can listen to the Cosmic Critmas demo <a href="https://cosmiccrit.com/">here</a>; my sessions with Atomless and No Quest are coming soon!</p>
                   <p><strong>But I Want More!</strong><br>

                   <br>
                   <p>Speaking of <em>Monster Core</em>, you might have seen the big dragon on the cover. This is an adamantine dragon, one of the new primal dragons in the book. Primal dragons draw on the magical energies of the natural world. These dragons tend to be the most bestial among dragons. As a result, they tend to be bulkier with more animalistic features like horns and spines. Some primal dragons even grow natural features on their bodies, like small plants.</p>
                   <p>The adamantine dragon—one of the skymetal dragons—got its name due to the adamantine that covers its body. The magic that flows through them draws adamantine to their bodies like a magnet, though some of these dragons naturally grow adamantine on their body, slowly replacing their hard scales with the skymetal as they age. Regardless of how the adamantine clings to their bodies, these dragons are tough. They’re so tough that they have a strong resistance against physical attacks. The claws and jaws of an adamantine dragon also allow them to burrow through dirt or even solid stone, sometimes emerging from beneath the ground to ambush their prey.</p>
                   <p>Adamantine dragons tend to use their shovel-like mouths to scoop up chunks of earth, consuming whatever rocks and unfortunate creatures are swept up in their bites. Instead of a typical dragon breath, adamantine dragons belch up all of these rocks, unleashing a veritable avalanche from within their bodies. While adamantine dragons typically don’t have the ability to cast spells, they make up for it with their hardy bodies and powerful blows.</p>
                   <p>So, that’s a little bit on the adamantine dragon! Don’t forget to check out this dragon and all of its draconic friends when <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02ej4?Pathfinder-Monster-Core"><em>Monster Core</em></a> releases in March. Stay tuned for more draconic previews in the coming weeks. Next time, we’ll take a look at the mysterious and cunning conspirator dragon. See you then!</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">Hello, Pathfinders and Starfinders! 2024 is going to be an incredibly exciting year for Paizo. This year, we’re releasing major Pathfinder rulebooks, including <em>Howl of the Wild</em>, the <em>Lost Omens Tian Xia World Guide</em>, and <em>Player Core 2</em>, as well as launching the playtest for Starfinder’s new edition!</p>
                   <p>We’d like to invite you to be part of the excitement by volunteering as an Organized Play GM! Our volunteer GMs are the best of the best, the cream of the crop, and the most helpful skittermanders in the galaxy. Last year, our volunteers ran over 1,000 games online and in person, and we’re looking to exceed that in 2024!</p>
                   <p>If you love our games so much that you want to introduce new players to them, and if you’re ready to GM on the biggest stages we can offer, then we want you to join the team! Even if you’ve never run Pathfinder or Starfinder Society before, our support team will make sure that you have everything you need to run your best games ever.</p>
                   <p>New this year, all GMs who run games at Premier or Premier Plus events will receive a $15 paizo.com voucher per block, which can also be spent in the Paizo booth at Gen Con in Indianapolis. Those who volunteer for more blocks may receive badges to the show, PDF or print products, or hotel rooms based on their commitment.</p>
                   <p>At this time, we’re accepting GMs for <strong>PaizoCon Online </strong>and <strong>Gen Con Indianapolis</strong>; information about Gen Con Online will come once Gen Con provides more information about the event. We’ve also included information from our friends at <strong>Origins</strong>; while Paizo won’t have an official presence there, we’re recognizing them as a Premier event, which means additional rewards for GMs and players. Who knows, maybe you’ll even see some Paizo staff at the event!</p>

                   <h2>PaizoCon Online 2024</h2>
                   <p>PaizoCon Online 2024 will take place online from May 24-27, 2024. It will have a physical component in the form of our PaizoCon@ program; see <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sih9?PaizoCon-Your-Local-Game-Store">last week’s blog</a> for more details. New content at this show includes the launch of Starfinder Society Year 7 (the final year for Starfinder first edition), the new Starfinder Society interactive special, and new Pathfinder Society scenarios.</p>
                   <p>Please note that this year we will be scheduling all PaizoCon Online events on <a href="https://tabletop.events/">Tabletop.Events</a>. As such, GMs will need to create a free account prior to completing the volunteer form.</p>
                   <p>We are currently seeking volunteers for the following roles:</p>
                   <ul>
                    <li><strong>Game Master</strong>: Run tables of Organized Play Scenarios, Bounties, and Quests.</li>
                    <li><strong>Headquarters (HQ)</strong>: Answer player and GM questions, seat players, handle conflicts and disputes, and report games after completion.</li>
                   </ul>
                   <p>Please read this important information before applying:</p>
                   <ul>
                    <li>Volunteer applications will be reviewed and accepted or rejected by the PaizoCon Organizing Committee. Filling this form out <strong>does not guarantee acceptance</strong>; you will receive an email with further information from the PaizoCon committee.</li>
                    <li>PaizoCon Online schedules will be <strong>assigned</strong> by the committee. You will be asked for your preference of system and level, but you will not necessarily be able to choose the specific scenario(s) you run. There is a free-form field at the end of the form to enter specific requests, though there’s no guarantee they will be honored.</li>
                    <li>Reward information is listed in the table below. GMs who do not qualify for a badge will still need to purchase one if they wish to play games.</li>
                    <li>Applications will be processed on a rolling basis, beginning no later than <strong>March 1</strong>. The earlier you get your application in, the more likely it is you’ll get the scenarios you want. Please be patient while we put the final details of the convention together internally before we send out GM emails!</li>
                    <li>Adventure authors interested in running tables of scenarios they have written should fill out this form and then follow up by emailing paizoorgplayhq@gmail.com. Anybody interested in running games outside of the Organized Play offerings (such as Infinite content, homebrew content, or games from other publishers) will be able to propose events once tickets go on sale. Stay tuned for future information!</li>
                    <li>Any questions about the GM signup process should be sent to the committee at <a href="mailto:paizoorgplayhq@gmail.com">paizoorgplayhq@gmail.com</a>.</li>

                   <p>Gen Con Indianapolis will take place in Indianapolis, Indiana from August 1-4, 2024. While we intend to participate in Gen Con Online, this application is <strong>only</strong> for the in-person show. New content at this show includes the launch of Pathfinder Society Year 6, the new Pathfinder Society Special, and the second run of the Starfinder Society interactive special. It will also feature the launch of the Starfinder Second Edition Playtest!</p>

                    <li><strong>Demo GM</strong>: Run quick demos for new players, giving them a short Pathfinder/Starfinder experience before quickly turning the table over for the next group. Our Demo GMs may receive an Exhibitor badge in compensation for the fast and furious nature of the position, subject to availability.</li>
                    <li><strong>Board Game Demo GM</strong>: Run demo tables for Goblin Firework Fight and Elemental Stones. Applicants should have strong board game knowledge (both our games and general board games) and preferably have related demo experience.</li>
                    <li><strong>Academy GM</strong>: Run games for young children (under 18) and their families, and provide a safe, welcoming environment for our youngest gamers. This position requires proof of a completed background check (employment in education, public service, or something similar may be accepted as verification that you have completed a background check).</li>

                   <h2>Origins 2024</h2>
                   <p>Ohio Org Play will again be sponsoring Pathfinder and Starfinder Society at Origins Game Fair from June 19-23, 2024, at the Greater Columbus Convention Center.</p>
                   <p>For those who have not been to Origins in the past, the convention runs from mid-day Wednesday to mid-day Sunday, for a total of 12 event slots. We set our scenario-length slots up as 5 hours of gaming, with 1 hour meal breaks between sessions to give our GMs plenty of time to eat and re-energize. More about Origins can be found here: <a href="https://www.originsgamefair.com/">https://www.originsgamefair.com/</a></p>
                   <p>We are currently seeking volunteers for the following roles:</p>
                   <ul>
                    <li><strong>Game Master</strong>: Run tables of Organized Play Scenarios, Bounties, and Quests.</li>
                    <li><strong>Headquarters (HQ)</strong>: Answer player and GM questions, seat players, handle conflicts and disputes, and report games after completion.</li>
                   </ul>
                   <p>Volunteer applications will be reviewed by the organizing committee. Filling the volunteer form out does not guarantee acceptance. As this is a large con with many moving parts, GM schedules will be assigned by the committee and sent out in order of volunteering. <strong>Volunteer early to lock in your preferences!</strong> Once your schedule is assigned and you confirm, you are considered committed to attending the event.</p>
                   <p>We value each of our volunteers who help to make this event happen. As a reward, we have Ohio Org Play shirts, water bottles, badges, accommodations for you or your vehicle, and bonus Achievement Points to send your way. But wait! This year, there’s more! Paizo has generously stepped in to provide voucher rewards to our GM volunteers this year, as well as free product for those who volunteer for more slots. Here’s a grid to keep track of everything:</p>

               <p itemprop="description">Elemental Stones is an abstract tile-placement and pattern-matching game for 2 to 4 players, in which you take on the role of powerful elemental sovereigns by placing and transforming tiles of five elements (fire, water, earth, wood, and metal)—with air as a sixth, wildcard element—in a constant struggle for dominance.

                   <p itemprop="description">Elemental Stones is an abstract tile-placement and pattern-matching game for 2 to 4 players, in which you take on the role of powerful elemental sovereigns by placing and transforming tiles of five elements (fire, water, earth, wood, and metal)—with air as a sixth, wildcard element—in a constant struggle for dominance. Today we want to give you a peek into how the game came to be and what you can expect find inside the box.</p>
                   <p>Designed by me (Joe Pasini) along with Jason Bulmahn, <em>Elemental Stones</em> is the first release in the Paizo Games line, which will consist of tabletop games designed, developed, and published by Paizo. We’re excited to bring you all-new game expressions that, while inspired by and connected to the rich worlds of Pathfinder and Starfinder, explore the opportunities presented by modern games, separate from pen-and-paper roleplaying games.</p>
                   <p>Elemental Stones began life as an inkling of a game inspired by the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02eju">Rage of Elements</a> hardcover book, which dives deep into the system of elements in Pathfinder (including two newly supported elements, metal and wood). We knew we wanted a simple-to-learn, highly replayable game that would involve the elemental cycle, placing satisfying objects on a board, and competing for elemental dominance, in the form of—what else—victory points. Early prototypes of a dotted grid with constellation-like patterns grew into a more robust hex-shaped grid and tokens with a relatively simple ruleset. With just a few tweaks along the way, this design allows for nuanced strategy and tactics each time you play.</p>
                   <p>Of course, as with any idea making its way from concept to concrete creation, there were some growing pains. Various card types were added, patterns shifted and changed, scoring metrics were constantly in flux, and the component list was rather fluid throughout early playtests. For example, we realized players would end up with extra stones at the end of most games and, as a result, would have less meaningful choices when choosing stones in later rounds. We eventually hit upon the idea of awarding points for having majorities in each type of stone as a way to solve two problems with one solution (if only there were a stone-related idiom for that… oh well). Everything about the game went through similar iterations, from the several other ways you can score points all the way to the production side, where we worked diligently with our manufacturer to create tiles that are just the right weight, size, and feel. In the end, we created a game that is quick and easy to play with up to four players in about 30-40 minutes, making it a perfect warm-up to your Pathfinder game night—or you can play multiple rounds for a whole evening of fun.</p>

                   <h3><strong>Great for Players and Game Masters on the Go</strong></h3>
                   <p>Designed for the modern player and Game Master, our Mobile Pathfinder VTT is a great solution for those seeking the thrill of Pathfinder on the go. When you’re playing with our Mobile VTT, you can play anywhere, anytime.</p>
                   <p>Computers and laptops have always been the main devices to play, while mobiles and tablets have been companion devices.</p>
                   <p>We are turning that concept on its head. A mobile phone is all you need to play.&nbsp;</p>
                   <h3><strong>The Player Core Toolkit - The Entry Phase</strong></h3>
                   <p>Our Player Core Toolkit is the entry phase of our VTT. It contains character creation, character sheets, dice rolling with automatic modifiers, and integrated rules accessible on the fly.</p>
                   <p>The Character Creator now contains all classes, ancestries, and heritages available in Pathfinder Player Core with assisted level-up on the way.</p>
                   <p>You can access some rule snippets without owning Paizo’s <em>Player Core</em>. More in-depth rules are accessible for free if you have purchased the Player Core PDF from Paizo*, or you can purchase the Player Core PDF with integration to our platform from us at Natural Pengu for $19.99.</p>
                   <h3><strong>The Next Phase - Mobile VTT Coming On Monday!</strong></h3>
                   <p>But that's not all. We're not just offering a character sheet – we are a full-fledged Virtual Tabletop. Maps, tokens, Game Master tools, and everything you need to create an immersive campaign are on the way with a basic early access version opening on Monday. We are committed to providing a comprehensive Mobile VTT experience that caters to every aspect of your Pathfinder adventure. With these coming functionalities, you can play with a complete VTT, all easily used through a web browser on your phone.</p>
                   <h3><strong>Early Access: Shape the Future with Us</strong></h3>
                   <p>Even though all classes have been tested, our VTT remains in the beta phase with many bugs to be found. You can choose a free plan, or a $1 plan, and get Early access to all of the Player Core Toolkit features.</p>
                   <p>By choosing our $2 plan you will also get Early access to the Natural Pengu Mobile VTT, when it becomes available on Monday.</p>
                   <p>These are limited time offers and prices may increase with time as the platform evolves. So get these low prices while you can! With your support we can keep developing the Natural Pengu Mobile VTT into something truly great.</p>

                   <p>While working on quests, we realized that their 2-hour length was a good sweet spot for younger attention spans, and so we decided to start using this new label on qualifying quests. What that means to us is that the adventure in question should be suitable for younger players without turning off veterans. It should avoid themes of horror or violent imagery, encourage creative solutions, and also employ nonviolent resolutions wherever possible. If there’s a fight, it shouldn’t be against something too scary or too human. The goal here is that if you’ve got a younger child, student, or sibling who can do the addition required to play the game, you can pull out one of these adventures and feel confident that they’ll have as much fun as you will.</p>
                   <p>Happy gaming to all our players, no matter how old!</p>

                   <p>We hope you’ll try the new sheet out, though, and make note of all the things you wish the current sheet could do while comparing it to the new sheet. There will be a feedback form, easily accessed within the community preview sheet, where you can submit your thoughts directly to the team. They plan to adjust their roadmap frequently to ensure you’re getting the features you want the most!</p>
                   <p>In case you haven’t seen the original blog post, this initial community preview of the sheet will include a couple of exciting improvements over the existing sheet:</p>

                   <p>We’ve got a great year coming up for you all! The Pathfinder Remaster continues to roll out, the Starfinder 2 playtest will launch, and we’ve got several great conventions spinning up. Not a lot has happened since our last blog (and not to give too much away, but I’m actually writing this four days after the December update went live), so let’s focus on what’s coming soon!</p>
                   <br>
                   <h2>Digital Adventure Releases</h2>
                   <p>These adventures will be available on January 31, 2024.</p>
                   <h3>Pathfinder Society</h3>

                   <br>
                   <h2>Premier Plus Convention Recruitment</h2>
                   <p>Are you interested in joining the legion of Paizo volunteers to help us put on some of the best conventions around? Then tune into the blog on <strong>January 18</strong>, when we’ll be posting recruitment for PaizoCon Online and Gen Con Indy GM volunteers! Our volunteers run Pathfinder and Starfinder Society games for hundreds of players, and we’d love to have you join us. Whether it’s your first time GMing or you’re a seasoned veteran, our team will welcome you and give you everything you need to give the players a fantastic experience.</p>
                   <p>This year, I’m pleased to announce that GM rewards for each slot will be increased to a $15 voucher. That means for every slot you run, you get $15 to spend on our webstore or in our booth at Gen Con on anything you like!</p>
                   <br>
                   <h2>Pathfinder Remaster &amp; Guide to Organized Play Updates</h2>
                   <p>At the end of December, we published some updates to the <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/characteroptions">Pathfinder Society Character Options</a> page and the <a href="https://lorespire.paizo.com/tiki-index.php?page=pfs2guide._.Pathfinder-2e-Remaster">Remaster Guidelines page</a>. The primary change here was to re-allow certain spellhearts we previously banned, with some clarifications about how to handle them after the Remaster’s removal of spell schools. It’s heartening to see that we’re getting fewer and fewer questions about rules clarifications, that means things are being answered in a timely manner! Please don’t hesitate to let us know about any outstanding issues.</p>
                   <p>The <a href="https://lorespire.paizo.com/tiki-index.php?page=Pathfinder-Society-(Second-Edition)-Guide-to-Organized-Play">Guide to Organized Play</a> has also been updated! Primarily, this change is to bring text in line with the remaster: changing “flat-footed” to “off-guard,” “spell level” to “spell rank,” and so on. We’ve also added citations referencing both the <em>Player Core</em> and the <em>Core Rulebook</em> where appropriate.</p>
                   <br>
                   <h2>Sanctioning</h2>
                   <p>After a quiet December, the sanctioning machine roars back to life! This month, expect to see the release of sanctioning documents for the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02eai?Starfinder-Scoured-Stars-Adventure-Path"><em>Starfinder Scoured Stars</em></a><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02eai?Starfinder-Scoured-Stars-Adventure-Path"><em> Adventure Path</em></a>, which I’m <em>extremely </em>excited about, as well as the <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/seasonOfGhosts"><em>Pathfinder Season of Ghosts Adventure Path</em></a>. Additionally, the Starfinder Society Character Options page will be updated with sanctioning for the material found in the <em>Angels of the Drift</em> comic series.</p>
                   <p>In March, we’ll be dropping sanctioning for <em>Seven Dooms for Sandpoint</em>, as well as the new <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02et8?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-Seven-Dooms-for-Sandpoint"><em>Pathfinder Monster Core</em></a>.</p>
                   <br>
                   <h2>GM Ranks</h2>
                   <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the 5th milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios, as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains (program dependent). A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th milestone is 650 hours!</p>
                   <p>This month, we had two GMs earn their 5th rank!</p>
                   <p><strong>5th Glyph (PFS2)</strong>: Landon Hatfield, Eric Parker</p>
                   <br>
                   <p>Happy new year, everybody! Until next time - Explore! Report! Cooperate! And get ready for convention signups!</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">Happy New Year! Welcome to the exciting reveal of our <a href="https://downloads.paizo.com/Starfinder_FieldTest_3.pdf"><b>third Starfinder Second Edition Field Test</b></a>.</p>
                   <p>It’s a new year and a new Field Test release! The Field Tests include early, behind-the-scenes previews of rules the Starfinder development team is playtesting internally in preparation for the <em>Starfinder Playtest Rulebook</em> release later this year. Our latest offering includes a preview of two ancestries appearing in the <em>Playtest Rulebook</em>, as chosen by community vote. We’re excited to announce the winners of that vote and the ancestries we’ll be featuring in today’s Field Test: the android and vesk!</p>
                   <p><strong>Ancestries</strong> are the updated version of what were known as <em>species</em> (also called <em>races</em> in older products) in Starfinder First Edition. Ancestries are an important part of Starfinder’s “cantina feel,” a term referring to the sci-fi trope of a spaceport bar packed with all kinds of aliens. In this context, it means players get to create and play as alien characters, and every planet or space station in the setting is teeming with weird and wonderful sapient lifeforms that player characters might interact with. Our goal is to keep the cantina open, so to speak, while we update existing Starfinder ancestries to be compatible with the new edition.&nbsp;</p>
                   <p>Starfinder ancestries might look familiar to those of you who play Pathfinder Second Edition. Starfinder First Edition players might notice the new ancestries are a bit of a departure from what you’re used to, but don’t panic! In Starfinder Second Edition, each ancestry entry includes more content than the small sidebar allotted to them in Starfinder First Edition.</p>
                   <p>In existing Starfinder books, you’ll often see a species boiled down to a list of statistics with a handful of abilities. Presenting species this way allowed the Starfinder team to introduce many playable options right away, but there was little players could do to define their character’s progression—via their species—beyond the initial selection. In some specific cases, a species was so numerically superior that they were the obvious “best” choices (we’re looking at you, SROs!). This was fantastic for certain players but didn’t always reward players interested in exploring different options. In the new edition of Starfinder, we want to create deeper meaning and context for ancestries that you’re going to play or feature in your campaigns. This means including more space for narrative lore related to each ancestry and information on how it fits into the setting, as well as progression-based selections to help further customize a character of that ancestry.</p>
                   <p>In addition to a set of starting adjustments and abilities, ancestries in Second Edition get access to ancestry feats. A character gains an ancestry feat at 1st level and then another at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th-level. Ancestry feats explore different paths within each ancestry and grant more powerful abilities as a character progresses—allowing you to customize your character beyond what was possible in Starfinder First Edition. The team’s been experimenting with some interesting new options, like expanding lashunta psychic powers or introducing a type of shirren that grows wings!</p>

                   <p>Today’s Field Test focuses on the constructed androids and the reptilian vesk. Androids and vesk are both staple ancestries in Starfinder, but each represents a very different part of the design spectrum. Androids already exist in Pathfinder Second Edition (see <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq026k5">Pathfinder Lost Omens: Ancestry Guide</a>), so the Starfinder team updated the ancestry to be compatible with the “ancient androids” who once walked lost Golarion while creating new options to represent the changes in culture and technology that separate the Starfinder setting from its distant past.</p>
                   <p>Meanwhile, vesk is an ancestry that’s never appeared in Pathfinder Second Edition, giving us a blank canvas to work with. Our intent was to keep the spirit of the First Edition vesk while exploring new build types, from movement-based shenanigans to different forms of natural melee attacks, and more.</p>
                   <p>The team is excited to see what you think of our initial foray into ancestry design for the new edition. We also <strong>strongly suggest </strong>you read the foreword in this document, which may reveal some important news related to what ancestries you can expect to see in the <em>Starfinder Playtest Rulebook</em> releasing this summer!</p>
                   <p>Stay tuned for our upcoming Paizo Live! where members of the Starfinder team will further discuss the Field Test, as well as give more hints about what we have planned for the new edition of Starfinder.</p>

                   <p>Hello, Pathfinders!<br>
                     This month is full of new gossip and <em>fascinating</em> new people popping up and around the Grand Lodge!</p>
                   <p>First off, we’ve been sending so many people over to <em>Jalmeray</em> and I am <em>so jealous</em>. I bet the weather is warm and lovely and the people are handsome and beautiful and gorgeous, and the food is delicious! But, alas, your Venture-Gossip must stay where their heart is: Absalom!</p>
                   <p>(At least until I get shipped off again for sneaking into private areas…)</p>
                   <p>Who have I seen lately? Well!</p>
                   <p>A new socialite has appeared on the scene! I haven’t <em>actually</em> seen her in person, since last month I was in the Mwangi Expanse talking about ships, <em>ugh</em>. But she’s apparently quite wealthy and quite lovely, keep your eyes peeled for Duchess Hesla Embersplitter!</p>
                   <p>Oh, right, I was asked to mention this:</p>
                   <p>If any of you have seen Kitsch’s favorite marble pestle, she’d appreciate it if you’d make sure it makes its way back to the Office of Procurement and Supplies before the end of the year. She needs it to powder some poison arrows and help prepare her popular ginger and cardamom cookies for the holiday party. She last saw the pestle when she was putting it in her left cheek pouch.</p>
                   <p>Anyway!</p>
                   <p>The Waterfall has been wandering around the Grand Lodge lately, sending people on all sorts of missions to various islands! I tried to poke my head into a meeting and was informed by her that my “natter wasn’t currently re­­quired for such a delicate meeting.” If any of you know what that word means, I’m eager to learn myself.</p>
                   <p>A handsome visitor has come to visit our own Fola Barun, perhaps for a lovely Crystalhue dinner? He’s a lovely fellow by the name of Yellick Broadcoat and seems to have rolled into town just in time for the festival of the winter solstice!</p>

                   <p>The original plan to present Season of Ghosts as a four-part Adventure Path was originally born out of a desire to set up the 200th volume of Pathfinder as a special double-sized book (more on that in a few months), but now that Season of Ghosts is coming out, I’m particularly pleased with two things that came about because of this choice. First, it let me organize the Adventure Path according to the four seasons, which gave the adventure authors some fun themes to work with and encouraged everyone to come up with some memorable uses for downtime in the campaign. Second, it let me structure the story using kishotenketsu (special thanks again to James Case for the great suggestion)! This is a traditional four-act story structure used in Chinese, Korean, and Japanese narratives in which the major turning point/narrative crescendo/plot twist of the story happens not in the final act, but the penultimate one. Hence my comment in the previous paragraph about this adventure serving as Season of Ghosts’ climax! This gives us an entire adventure (coming next month) to focus on the results and ramifications of the story and wrap things up with some new and intense developments of their own, resulting in what I think is not only a truly memorable campaign, but in what is certainly one of the Adventure Paths I’m the proudest to have been a part of. (And not just because it let me get a lot of cat artwork in print!)</p>

                   <p>Hi everyone! I’m Dan Cascone, and I’ve crawled out from under my rock to join Eleanor Ferron in writing <em>No Breath to Cry</em>. You may remember me from contributions to books such as <em>Pathfinder Dark Archive</em>, <em>Pathfinder Treasure Vault</em>, <em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Highhelm</em>, and the upcoming <em>Pathfinder</em><em>Howl of the Wild</em>. I look forward to hearing about all your horrible deaths and triumphant victories over the challenges we’ve put in the adventure.</p>
                   <br>
                   <h3>Eleanor Ferron</h3>
                   <p>Hello! I'm Lost Omens senior developer Eleanor Ferron, and I teamed up with co-author Dan Cascone to write the third volume of the Season of Ghosts Adventure Path, <em>No Breath to Cry</em>. As a fan of Asian horror and horror-adjacent media such as <em>Onmyouji</em>, <em>Kuon</em>, and <em>Fatal Frame</em>, as well as the supernatural shenanigans of <em>Inuyasha</em> and <em>Goblin: The Great and Lonely God</em>, I enjoyed getting to bring all these inspirations into the world of Pathfinder. I hope you survive your time in Willowshore, and hopefully even have fun doing so. Be nice to foxes, don't go near the baskets, and always carry a camera to catch ghosts.</p>
                   <br>
                   <h3>Michelle Y. Kim</h3>
                   <p>Hi, this is Michelle! I’m a Korean American TTRPG writer and designer who contributed some backmatter to Season of Ghosts, and I am so excited for you all to meet some truly terrible little guys (and maybe not so little guys) in the haunted lands of Shenmen. As a lover of both folklore and horror, this project was a delight, and I look forward to hearing about everyone’s adventures. Currently I'm working on a Joseon Dynasty setting supplement for <em>Good Society: A Jane Austen RPG</em> by Storybrewers Roleplaying, which I talked a bit about on the Asians Represent! Podcast. You can find me on Twitter as @_missmyk_ or at Bluesky at @missmyk.bsky.social. I've recently joined the Paizo team as a developer and will be helping create more wild adventures from the other side of the screen!</p>

                   <h3>Eren Ahn (they/them)</h3>
                   <p>Hello! I’m Eren (they/them, primarily), and you’ll see some of my work in the upcoming Lost Omens Tian Xia books for Pathfinder Second Edition. My family didn’t have too many winter traditions growing up (I got presents on Christmas for the first ten years of my life and tteokguk (rice cake soup) on New Year’s after that), but since I started living on my own, I adapted some traditional dongji rituals to celebrate the solstice. For me, this means making patjuk (red bean porridge) and leaving a small bowl of it on my windowsill overnight for any wandering spirits. I’m fond of winter, cold snaps and polar vortexes and all, and it’s a calming ritual to look forward to in my generally fast-paced life.</p>
                   <br>
                   <h3>James Jacobs (he/him)</h3>
                   <p>I’m James Jacobs (he/him), Narrative Creative Director for Pathfinder, and for me, the winter holidays are traditionally when I wander some 800 miles south to spend time with my family and to relax in my hometown of Sandpoint/Otari/Point Arena. There were a few years there during the pandemic when this tradition got interrupted, but things are mostly back to normal there. Bad weather might step in to keep me here in Washington (as it has a few times in the past), but otherwise the long journey south beckons with its promises of hanging out with family, relaxing in the redwoods of Northern California, visiting some local landmarks (during Thanksgiving I visited the Point Arena Lighthouse, which is the tallest lighthouse on the west coast of the United States, and which you’ve also seen if you watched movies like <em>Forever Young</em> or <em>Need for Speed</em>), and hoping for a bigfoot sighting or two.</p>

                   <p>Hi everyone, I’m Joshua Birdsong. I am a designer for Paizo. I am very excited and humbled to be part of such an amazing team, and I look forward to helping create some awesome books for all of you! My favorite holiday tradition is consuming an entire container of chocolate hazelnut pirouline wafers on Christmas day! If you need to get in touch, you can find me on Twitter at @impr0phet. Don’t forget to be awesome!</p>

                   <h3>Lynne M. Meyer (she/they)</h3>
                   <p>Hello! I’m Lynne (she/they), the newest member of Paizo’s editing team. I’m pagan but grew up in a Protestant family. My holidays aren’t complete without pfeffernusse, a traditional German spice cookie. When I was growing up, my German grandmother lived with us and taught me to bake. She had pfeffernusse every Christmas—and only at Christmas. I looked forward to it every year.</p>
                   <p>When she passed, the tradition stopped. Years later, when I started dating the man who’d become my husband, I decided to bring it back. I even used my grandmother’s antique measuring cups.</p>
                   <p>It turned out that pfeffernusse is his favorite cookie! Pfeffernusse became my signature bake. Pre-pandemic, I’d make as many as ten dozen to share with our families. Times are different now, and those celebrations are happy memories. Circumstances make it difficult to see our families in person, and I’ve since lost my father as well as a brother.</p>
                   <p>Yet pfeffernusse remains part of my Yule. It’s the one holiday tradition I keep without fail. It ties me to my past and my present with love. Every year, when the aroma of anise hits me, I’m a little girl again, celebrating Christmas with my family.</p>

                   <h3>Rue Dickey (they/he/xe)</h3>
                   <p>Growing up and living in a very mixed-culture household means I celebrate a wide variety of holidays during December (Christmas Eve with my in-laws, Chanukah, the Solstice, and “Witch-mas” with my mom—Christmas day, but it’s goth and we make hot chocolate and exchange gifts). One tradition that transcends all of these holidays, though, is making fudge!</p>
                   <p>I use my grandmother’s fudge recipe (included below), which has been handwritten, photocopied several times, and taken a picture of via a phone to wind up in my hands. It makes 5 pounds of fudge—no more, no less, and no ratio editing allowed. And now you can make it too!</p>
                   <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
                   <ul>
                    <li>4 ½ cups of white sugar</li>
                    <li>2 cubes (8 oz) of butter</li>
                    <li>1 (12 oz) can of evaporated milk</li>
                    <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
                    <li>18 oz semi-sweet chocolate chips (or semi-sweet chocolate, chopped)</li>
                    <li>1 (7 oz) jar of marshmallow fluff</li>
                    <li>2 cups chopped nuts (optional)</li>
                   </ul>
                   <p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
                   <ol>
                    <li>Cook the sugar, butter, evaporated milk, and vanilla over medium heat until the mixture comes to a slow boil.</li>
                    <li>Beat with electric mixture for seven (7) minutes, continuously. 
                     <ol>
                      <li>My wife and I take turns holding the mixer for this step, as it can start to ache.</li>
                     </ol></li>
                    <li>Remove from heat.</li>
                    <li>Add in chocolate chips, marshmallow fluff, and nuts (optional).</li>
                    <li>Stir until all ingredients are well mixed.</li>
                    <li>Pour into 13” x 9” baking pan and chill in fridge until set (about 2 hours). 
                     <ol>
                      <li>If you’re like me and want to eat hot, kind of un-set fudge, half an hour on the counter is enough to make it cool enough to eat, but still warm and soft.</li>
                     </ol></li>
                    <li>Cut into cubes and enjoy.</li>
                   </ol>
                   <p>(Makes five pounds)</p>

                   <p>Here in Argentina the holidays are during summertime. In the coast city in which I live, we usually spend the days going to the beach, and resting at home after that. Some card and board games are often played as well. On Christmas and New Year's Eve I meet with my family, and many others from my father's family, and get some asado (fantastically grilled meat from here). After midnight, once presents are opened, or exchanged, or a toast is made if it's New Year's Eve, it's time to meet with friends, where we spend the rest of the night playing games, might get a holiday-themed one-shot going, and go see the sunrise together when it comes.</p>

                   <p>Hello again Pathfinders!<br>
                     This month we’ve got another quest for you. It turns out the previous queen of Irrisen left numerous magical dollhouses in storage within her palace at Whitethrone. The current queen, Anastasia—short on allies and trying to make sense of the strange magics of the land she now rules—has turned to the Pathfinder Society to investigate, and sent one of the dollhouses over to Absalom. However, with the various threats to the Society that have occurred in the past year, both the dollhouse and the investigation have been largely ignored. This is quite unfortunate for you, our intrepid adventurers, for magical schemes of the hag we all love to hate, Aslynn, have inadvertently reactivated the dollhouse’s magic. As it turns out, these dollhouses were once magical prisons, shrinking prisoners down to doll size. Can you find a way to escape the Winter Queen’s Dollhouse?</p>
                   <p><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02es8?Pathfinder-Quest-16-The-Winter-Queens-Dollhouse"><em>Pathfinder Quest (Series 2) #16: The Winter Queen's Dollhouse</em></a> is an adventure suitable for even our youngest Pathfinders (and any others who happen to be 1st- through 4th-level) written by Brite Cheney.</p>
                   <p>We hope you all love it!</p>

                   <p>Over in Arcadia this month, the Pathfinder Society has been asked to participate in an old ceremony meant to reestablish good relations with local spirits and ensure the continued safety of the settlement of Niishan. This is a great honor, one bestowed on the Society for their work last year to repatriate the star gun Hatahasi back into their home. As the Pathfinders explore the village and work to prepare for the first night of the festivities, they’ll need to contend with a spirit of the land who’s not so sure about their presence.</p>
                   <p>Once the sun goes down, a spirit of unnerving size and unwavering fury awaits, ready to see Niishan’s ceremony fail so that he may seek revenge…</p>

                   <p>Happy adventures, Pathfinders! And keep warm during these long nights!</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">Hello everyone, and happy December! This blog is a week later than usual because I’ve just returned from PAX Unplugged, which was a tremendous success! It was our first visit since 2019, as well as my first visit overall, so I wasn’t sure what to expect. My worst fear was that nobody would be interested in our games, and we’d be sitting around all day bored out of our skulls.</p>
                   <p>I am delighted to report that we had the exact <em>opposite</em> problem. We got a <em>ton</em> of attention from attendees, many of whom were excited to talk about the Pathfinder Remaster and pick up the newest books. Our retail partner, Card Titan, ran out of books by the end of the show!</p>
                   <p>But by far the biggest star throughout was Starfinder 2! We ran alpha demos of the game, which were a roaring success. We had attendees waiting <em>hours</em> in line to play, and everyone who walked away from the table was excited about the new edition. I can’t wait until we get to start showing it off to a wider audience!</p>
                   <p>With that said, let’s dive into our update!</p>
                   <br>
                   <h2>Digital Adventure Releases</h2>
                   <p>These adventures will be available on December 20, 2023.</p>

                   <h2>Lorespire Wiki</h2>
                   <p>Last month, the hosting for the Guides to Organized Play went down for a couple of very chaotic weeks. I’m delighted to announce that they are back online in their new home, the <a href="http://lorespire.paizo.com/">Lorespire Wiki</a>! You can access this wiki at <strong>lorespire.paizo.com</strong>. This is a Paizo-hosted server, so it should remain online for as long as the rest of our website is.</p>
                   <p>Our Guide Team has been hard at work both restoring service and updating the Pathfinder Society Guide to be in line with the Remaster. In coming weeks we’ll also be looking at hosting additional resources here, such as region homepages to help players find games. Stay tuned for new and exciting things on this front!</p>
                   <br>
                   <h2>Pathfinder Remaster</h2>
                   <p>The Pathfinder Remaster launched last month to great success! The books have been flying off the warehouse shelves, and Pathfinder Society characters are converting like never before! A reminder that the guidelines for these changes are available on the <a href="https://lorespire.paizo.com/tiki-index.php?page=pfs2guide._.Pathfinder-2e-Remaster">Lorespire Wiki</a>.</p>
                   <p>We’ve made a couple of updates to the <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/characteroptions">Character Options</a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/faq">FAQ pages</a> since the launch, so be sure to keep an eye on those for future changes. Thank you all for your patience and understanding, and for your helpful questions in the forum threads as we stamp out any issues. It’s our hope that all this work will make the launch of <em>Player Core 2</em>next summer as smooth as possible.</p>
                   <br>
                   <h2>2024 Major Conventions</h2>
                   <p>This is just a heads-up that very soon, we’ll be soliciting GMs for PaizoCon Online as well as Gen Con Indy! Stay tuned to the Paizo blog for more information on this in January but mark your calendars now. We’re hoping to make both conventions better than ever before, and to do that we need talented volunteers like you!</p>
                   <br>
                   <h2>GM Recognition</h2>
                   <h3>Campaign Service Coins</h3>
                   <p>This month, several new Campaign Service Coins were awarded at local conventions! We award these coins to members of the community who have gone above and beyond to provide an exceptional program to the community at large. Campaign Coins are awarded based on nominations; if you believe someone in your community is deserving of this award (whether they are a Venture Officer or not), send an email to organizedplay[at]paizo[dot]com with their name and the reasons they deserve the award.</p>
                   <p>Congratulations to:<br><strong>Wally Waltner</strong>, who now holds a campaign coin and OP ID #872<br><strong>Barb Crase</strong>, who now holds a campaign coin and OP ID #901<br>
                     and <strong>Nicholas Ruchlewicz</strong>, who now holds a campaign coin and OP ID #906</p>
                   <h3>GM Ranks</h3>
                   <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the 5th milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 must be special scenarios, as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains (program dependent). A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th milestone is 650 hours!</p>
                   <p>This month, we had one GM earn their 5th rank!</p>
                   <p><strong>5th Glyph (PFS2)</strong>: Doug Edwards (our third 5/5/5 GM!)</p>
                   <br>
                   <p>That’s all from me! Until next time - Explore! Report! Cooperate! I’ll see you next year!</p>

                   <p>The Pathfinder Society is invited by Mayor Deyahi to take part in a special traditional ceremony known as the Festival of Fire! This ceremony has been performed for generations and is always an honor for the group of warriors chosen to defend the sacred bonfire. While it's expected that there will be several spirits and undead appearing throughout the evening, what Niishan is unaware of is the fact that an unknown figure has been watching the ceremony for its entirety, waiting for the time that the warriors are weak enough to make their move. With the Pathfinders appearing to fill this role, they see their chance to attack and make Niishan feel their ancient wrath. It's up to the PCs to hold off this villain and the other spirits, ensuring that the ceremony is successful and Niishan remains safe!</p>

                   <p>A Pathfinder Society Quest designed for 1st- through 4th-level characters, playable in 2-3 hours.</p>
                   <p>The ruler of Irrisen, Queen Anastasia, found a number of strange dollhouses when going through her aunt's vaults. She sent one to the Pathfinders for study. When Aslynn's magic was unleashed in the vaults of Skyreach, the dollhouse's magic was reactivated. In reality, these dollhouses were prisons that would shrink down those who angered Elvanna, the former queen. Now the magic is poised to ensnare the PCs. What's more, the animate doll servants have awakened as poppets, and while some are happy to help, others are not so welcoming.</p>

                   <p><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02efv">Starfinder Enhanced</a> takes center stage this go around. This includes clarifications on how the enhanced witchwarper can take advantage of their alternate class features, some significant boosts to biohacker snipers and medics, and fixes to the DC of some troublesome feats. We also updated the back-matter of a handful of Adventure Path volumes, including the starsinger archetype from <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02asc?Starfinder-Adventure-Path-47-Nightmare-Scenario">Starfinder Adventure Path #47: Nightmare Scenario</a> and the plane-touched species from <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02dv1?Starfinder-Adventure-Path-46-The-Perfect-Storm">Starfinder Adventure Path #46: The Perfect Storm</a>. Almost every hardcover has some level of errata, but perhaps the biggest change involves some clarifications to the Starfinder Roleplaying Game system itself, including official clarification that you can now intentionally hit a willing ally without an attack roll, and an explanation of how characters with a 0 ft reach can engage in melee combat! There are many other changes and, as always, we welcome more questions, comments, and feedback on our Rules Questions <a href="https://paizo.com/community/forums/starfinder/rules">forums</a>. And feel free to discuss this errata right here on this blog post!</p>
                   <p>Continued thanks to our Organized Play Program for finding many of these concerns!</p>
