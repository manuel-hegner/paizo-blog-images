  artist: "Become a Hero! Leave the ordinary behind and take your first step into\
    \ a world of amazing fantasy adventure with the Pathfinder Beginner Box! This\
    \ box contains everything you need to learn how to play the Pathfinder roleplaying\
    \ game, including rules to create your own fantasy hero and tools to tell your\
    \ own incredible stories. On a personal note, I hope that veterans will enjoy\
    \ using it to introduce Pathfinder to new players, that curious players from other\
    \ RPGs will get a taste of the abundance of accessories we offer, and that people\
    \ who have never played an RPG will find it easy to dive into alongside their\
    \ friends!"

  artist: "Work Hard, Play Hard Life isn’t easy on the edge—not while working for\
    \ EJ Corp, anyway. The Company keeps you too poor to quit, desperate for your\
    \ next bonus. So when a series of jobs go bad, you know who they’re gonna blame:\
    \ you. It’s time to kick loose from the Company, with a little help from a drow\
    \ crime boss. If his crazy plan works, you just might be calling your own shots\
    \ from here on out. We are working on the new Adventure Path trailer video and\
    \ plan to show it off in early December. We are considering a rebellious Western\
    \ music acoustic soundtrack to suit the genre. Shiny."

  artist: "Prison Breakers The Edgewatch agents have been disgraced and the primarch\
    \ thrown behind bars! In this, their darkest of hours, the heroes must delve into\
    \ Absalom’s criminal underbelly in order to reach the light. After earning the\
    \ favor of one of Absalom’s most notorious crime lords, they infiltrate the Black\
    \ Whale, Absalom’s infamous floating prison, to rescue the primarch and clear\
    \ their names. The Agents of Edgewatch Adventure Path continues with “Belly of\
    \ the Black Whale,” a complete adventure for 15th- to 18th-level characters."

  artist: "Whether the heroes are trying to flag down a robo-taxi for a night on the\
    \ town or hopping a grav-train to the next city over, no Game Master wants to\
    \ spend time drawing every ticket kiosk and waiting room bench. Fortunately, with\
    \ Paizo's latest Starfinder Flip-Mat, you don't have to! This line of gaming maps\
    \ provides ready-to-use science-fantasy set pieces for the busy Game Master. This\
    \ double-sided map features a grav-train platform on one side and a waiting room\
    \ and robo-taxi stand on the other. Don't waste time sketching when you could\
    \ be playing. With Starfinder Flip-Mat: Transport Hub, you'll be ready the next\
    \ time your players need a ticket out of town!"
