  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Thursday, January 6, 2010</p> \n   <p>Howdy, everyone!\
  \ So, hot on the heels of the announcement of \"<a href=\"/paizo/blog/tags/designTuesdays\"\
  >Design Tuesdays</a>,\" I'm here to unveil the first installment of \"Golarion Day!\"\
  \ Every Thursday, we'll try to do a post that expands the world of Golarion in some\
  \ small way. Sometimes, this might be a tiny new rules element. Other times, it\
  \ might be a bit of lore. It could be a brief look into an upcoming product or an\
  \ interview with someone who's worked on the world of Golarion. Or, as in today's\
  \ case, it could be a quick update of older rules to the current Pathfinder RPG\
  \ system. Let me know what you think, and if you have any special requests for future\
  \ Golarion Days, let me know that as well!</p> \n   <p>So, back in the day in the\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinder/campaignSetting/v5748btpy81xy\"><i>Guide to Korvosa</i></a>,\
  \ we told you about a group of rangers called the Sable Company. Exported from my\
  \ homebrew game (where they were known as Skyriders), these highly trained city\
  \ guards patrol the skies above Korvosa on hippogriffs that they've bonded with.\
  \ In <i>Guide to Korvosa</i>, we handled this bit of fun flavor by simply introducing\
  \ a new feat: \"Sable Company Marine,\" which let rangers select hippogriffs as\
  \ an animal companion. And for a few years, all was well and good.</p> \n   <p>Then\
  \ we went and did something unthinkable. We changed games. And in the <a href=\"\
  /pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8auu\"><i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i></a>, we didn't even\
  \ bother to keep the poor hippogriff around. The griffin was there, sure, but no\
  \ sign of his less cultured kin.</p> \n   <p>I'll be honest. I was a bit surprised\
  \ to see the hippogriff become the most-missed monster from the <i>Bestiary</i>.\
  \ I would have assumed something bigger and badder, like missing titans or nightwalkers\
  \ or inevitables would get folks riled up, but I was wrong. So when it came time\
  \ to do <a href=\"h/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8hif\"><i>Bestiary 2</i></a>, it was\
  \ obvious what monsters we needed to include—chief among them was the hippogriff.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>But the job still wasn't finished, because we'd also changed the way rangers\
  \ get animal companions, and we'd even changed the way animal companions work.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>So, until we actually get around to revisiting Korvosa's Sable Company\
  \ in print (which, I bet, we'll do some day in the future), check out the following\
  \ rules for allowing rangers to gain hippogriffs as animal companions. Note that\
  \ we've changed the way you gain a hippogriff from a mere feat to a ranger archetype—\
  this is because hippogriffs are pretty powerful creatures as far as animal companions\
  \ go, and not all rangers have the right stuff to serve in the Sable Company. It\
  \ requires the sacrifice of some traditional ranger training in order to master\
  \ a bond with a hippogriff, in addition to being a member of the Sable Company itself.\
  \ It's up to your GM whether the Sable Company is hiring. (Basically, you need your\
  \ GM's permission to select this archetype, and your GM may require your character\
  \ to perform certain duties as befits your responsibilities in the Sable Company.)\
  \ In fact, if your GM's cool with it, you can adjust the adjustments and flavor\
  \ of the archetype so that other classes can get access to hippogriffs as riding\
  \ companions—you can even use these rules as a sort of template to open up \"animal\
  \ companions\" for similarly powered magical beasts. Because who wouldn't want to\
  \ play a halfling ankheg rider?</p> \n   <p>Anyway, here you go: Pathfinder-compatible\
  \ updates for the Sable Company of Korvosa!</p> \n   <blockquote> \n    <h1>Ranger\

  \ a hippogriff with great skill, you have also formed a close bond with a particular\
  \ mount. A Sable Company Marine has the following class features:</p> \n    <p><b>Hippogriff\
  \ Companion</b>: You can gain a hippogriff as a companion. This ability works identically\
  \ to hunter's bond when used to gain an animal companion, but can only be used to\
  \ gain a hippogriff (see below for rules for hippogriff companions). You gain a\
  \ +2 bonus on Ride checks made when riding your hippogriff companion, and whenever\
  \ you are within 20 feet of your hippogriff, it gains a +2 morale bonus on all saving\
  \ throws made against fear effects. This ability replaces favored terrain and hunter's\
  \ bond.</p> \n    <h1>Hippogriff Companions</h1> \n    <p><b>Starting Statistics</b>:\
