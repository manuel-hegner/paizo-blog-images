  \ Beyond</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Friday, March 13, 2009</p> \n    <p><i>After\
  \ yesterday's fateful misadventure, we have decided against heavily drinking Qadiran\
  \ firewine before plumbing the depths of the Vault in the future. Today, dear readers,\
  \ we promise to fetch only the finest art from the Golem's boundless treasury. Presented\
  \ here are the axiomites and astradaemons from <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy84bb\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Chronicles: The Great Beyond</i></a>, illustrated by Sarah Stone.\
  \ Our deepest apologies for the errors of our last theft.</i></p> \n    <p><i>Vadid\
  \ and Nahk</i> <br>Preview Purloiners</p> \n   </blockquote> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderChronicles/PZO9209-Axiomite.jpg\"\

  \ border=\"0\" align=\"right\"></a> \n   <blockquote> \n    <p>The lords, caretakers,\
  \ and architects of the eternal city of Axis, the axiomites possess a wide variety\
  \ of outward forms, oddly unlike the uniformity displayed by their fellow natives,\
  \ the hive-dwelling formians. A random cross-section of axiomite society contains\
  \ those who resemble flawless, perfect humanoids of all descriptions—typically humans,\
  \ elves, tieflings, dwarves, halflings, giants, and even gnomes—but these outward\
  \ shapes belie their true forms, which can be seen briefly whenever the axiomites\
  \ move or perform any complex actions. During such moments, their bodies partly\
  \ dissolve into glowing clouds of golden, crystalline dust. The clouds move and\
  \ contort on their own accord, temporarily congealing into twisting lines of mathematic\
  \ symbols and complex tangles of equations. Each axiomite is actually an immortal\
  \ construct of living, intelligent mathematics approximating a humanoid shape.</p>\
  \ \n   </blockquote> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderChronicles/PZO9209-Astradaemon.jpg\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderChronicles/PZO9209-Astradaemon_120.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\" align=\"left\"></a> \n   <blockquote> \n    <p>Astradaemons appear\
  \ as ghostly, faintly phosphorescent, rail-thin humanoids with exaggeratedly long\
  \ limbs. The fiends also have a seemingly random number of translucent tentacles\
  \ trailing from their backs, shoulders, and upper arms, which wave and weave through\
  \ the air. Their bizarre forms possess heads that are skeletal, elongated, and vaguely\
  \ piscine, reptilian, or canine, always bearing hungry rictus grins. Wicked, curved\
  \ claws sprout from their hands and feet, and each creature’s tail moves in rhythm\
  \ with its tentacles, typically hanging toward the ground and almost doubling its\
  \ length. As the perpetually ravenous servitors of Abbadon’s archdaemons, the astradaemons’\
  \ touch is corruptive and damaging to the spiritual material of souls. Their touch\
  \ and especially their bite can cause horrific damage, akin to that of a wraith,\
  \ to anything they attack. Most feared, however, is their ability to utterly consume\
  \ the souls of those killed in their proximity, feeding off of their essence or\
  \ dragging it back to their fiendish overlords.</p> \n   </blockquote> <!-- tags:\
