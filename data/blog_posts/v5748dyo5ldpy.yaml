  \ Preview: Oh, For a Muse of Fire!</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, July 31,\
  \ 2012</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><i>The massive burning blade of the fire\
  \ giant whipped through the air in a horizontal stroke, just inches above Merisiel’\
  s head. She deftly lunged to the side to avoid the deadly strike, but singed one\
  \ of her long graceful ears in the process.</i></p> \n     <p><i>“Your assistance\
  \ would be greatly appreciated,” she shouted at Valeros, who was busy fending off\
  \ a pack of flaming hounds across the room. Her lunge transformed into a roll past\
  \ the giant’s right knee, the blade of her dagger finding purchase in a seam of\
  \ his ensorcelled armor. Roaring with pain, the giant pulled back and raised his\
  \ sword overhead. </i></p> \n     <p><i>Avoiding the flaming maws of the hell hounds,\
  \ Valeros brought his blade down on the head of one of the snapping beasts, dousing\
  \ its fires for good before turning to take on a pair of the hounds coming up from\
  \ behind. “I’m beginning to think the diadem of the giant lord might not be worth\
  \ this price!”</i></p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\"\
  >Valeros might be unsure, but you are definitely going to want to get your hands\
  \ on all the valuable items packed in the pages of <a href=\"/products/btpy8rcd\"\
  ><i>Ultimate Equipment</i></a>, due out in just 3 weeks. This preview includes more\
  \ treasure from this mighty tome—specifically, the loot from a CR 11 encounter with\
  \ a fire giant and a pack of hell hounds.</span></p> \n    <p>Fire Giants are humanoids\
  \ that can possess a number of different treasure types, but for this encounter\
  \ we are going to be focusing on Type E: Armor and Weapons with a splash of Type\
  \ B: Coins and Gems. With 10,500 gp worth of loot to give out, we are sure to have\
  \ some great items.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><b>Treasure Type E: Armor and\
  \ Weapons<br> 8,000 gp Reward (total value 8,000 gp)</b><br> <i>+1 defiant full\
  \ plate</i> (humanoid [elf]), <i>+1 greatsword</i></p> \n     <p><b>Treasure Type\
  \ B: Coins and Gems<br> 2,500 gp Reward (total value 2,450 gp)</b><br> 600 gp, opal\
  \ (worth 450 gp), unworked topaz gemstone (worth 300 gp), diadem set with a single\
  \ flawless black pearl (worth 1,100 gp)</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Looks like\
  \ Merisiel is going to have a difficult time hurting that fire giant. One of the\
  \ great things about this system is the ability to customize the treasure to suit\
  \ the needs of the encounter. Even if you feel like rolling randomly on the many\
  \ tables throughout the book, you can still pick and choose specific pieces to enhance\
  \ your encounters. This week, I made sure that the most valuable gemstone was actually\
  \ a piece of jewelry (the rules for creating and pricing jewelry can be found in\
  \ the preview spread from last week looking at art objects); that way it would fit\
  \ the story I was trying to tell.</p> \n    <p>Well, that wraps up this week. Next\
  \ week, our brave heroes will be going for some big treasure, while trying to plunder\
  \ the lair of an ancient white dragon!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n \
