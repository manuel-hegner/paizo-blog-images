  artist: "combining a various different mythological and literary sources. So I guess\
    \ I shouldn't have been surprised when, in his final novel, he did it one last\
    \ time. At first, I balkedâ€”up to this point, Infernal Sorceress had been a fairly\
    \ hard-edged and gritty fantasy romp. What were a bunch of talking weasel-people\
    \ doing here? Yet once I got past my initial knee-jerk reaction (which said that\
    \ such things were better off left in one of Brian Jacques's Redwall novels),\
    \ I realized that, in fact, they fit the story perfectly. After all, what's the\
    \ point of fantasy if not to mix things up and make the reader question their\
    \ standard assumptions? In throwing in something totally out of left field, Gygax\
    \ was rattling my cage and reminding me that there's more to the genre than just\
    \ the same old white-bread elves and dwarves we all know and love. And besides,\
    \ their accents are totally adorable. So with that said, I thought I'd offer you\
    \ all the first (and quite possibly last) appearance of the ferretfolk: Below,\
    \ Ferret stared a second in horror. What little light there was danced and swayed\
    \ wildly, but it was sufficient to show him the ugly mandibles and head of the\
    \ steelback as the monster came up into the cave. The hole's exit was a tight\
    \ fit for it, but the myriapod was forcing its hard body through it all too quickly.\
    \ Each segment through gave it two more legs with which to haul the rest of it\
    \ out to get at its prey. \"Oh, crap! Now what?\" Ferret cursed as he turned to\
    \ look for a really fast means of getting up to the passage he wasn't sure would\
    \ save them"
