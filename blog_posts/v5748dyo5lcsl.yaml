  \ class=\"PTales\"></div></a> \n    <h1>Blood and Money</h1> \n    <p>by Steven\
  \ Savile</p> \n    <h2>Chapter Two: The Masquerade</h2> \n    <p>The fact that someone\
  \ wanted him dead was a bitter pill for Isra to swallow, but not a particularly\
  \ surprising one. Act like an idiot long enough, splashing the cash and taking it\
  \ as gospel that every woman in the city had been put there for your pleasure, and\
  \ you were going to incur a certain amount of jealousy. That was just part of the\
  \ image he had cultivated to hide the Nightwalker from prying eyes. And he was good\
  \ at it. No one in their right mind would suspect Isra Darzi was capable of anything\
  \ beyond getting drunk and making passes at the lithe, long-legged ladies.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Of course there was the risk that went along with the kind of women he chased—\
  or rather the husbands of these beautiful creatures, who had the nasty habit of\
  \ thinking they owned them. But that was all just part of the game.</p> \n    <p>And\
  \ Isra was rather fond of the game.</p> \n    <p>No, the thing that disturbed him\
  \ was the fact that, of all the assassins in the city, the Nightwalker had been\
  \ hired to carry out the kill. The Nightwalker was by far the most sought-after\
  \ killer in Katapesh. His contracts commanded vast sums of money because they were\
  \ <i>always</i> completed. Always. Like death and taxes, the Nightwalker was one\
  \ of the few things that could be relied upon. Which of course made this whole thing\
  \ slightly farcical. How was he supposed to kill himself and uphold the legend of\
  \ the Nightwalker without actually killing himself?</p> \n    <p>At least three\
  \ people knew his services had been retained: the client, his agent Mirza, and him.\
  \ Mirza wouldn’t talk—it wasn’t in his interest to slay the legend, not when he\
  \ lived off the commissions it brought in. So that left the client.</p> \n    <p>When\
  \ someone wanted a man dead, it usually went one of three ways: One, they blustered\
  \ and shouted about it drunkenly in a tavern, making idle threats. Two, they made\
  \ some half-assed attempt themselves and generally botched it. Or three, they got\
  \ serious about it. And the Nightwalker was very much part of option three.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>So the question was twofold: who wanted him dead, and of that long list\
  \ of jilted lovers, cuckolded husbands, and bankrupted merchants he’d left trailing\
  \ in his wake, who could afford the price?</p> \n    <p>He felt reasonably sure\
  \ he could discount the traders, given that when he was through with them they were\
  \ invariably too poor to rub two coins together.</p> \n    <p>Katapesh was a thriving\
  \ city. Anything and everything could be and was traded, no matter how exotic or\
  \ expensive. In any mercantile hub there were rich men—lots of them. Where one man\
  \ could profit at the misfortune of another, it was assured that the rich and powerful\
  \ would cluster around like vultures waiting to pick off the dead and dying. Isra\
  \ had rivals. He wasn’t naive enough to think otherwise. Two or three were certainly\
  \ wealthy enough, but they were also the closest things he had to friends. Not that\
  \ friendship meant they could be ruled out. How many times had one friend stabbed\
  \ another in the back?</p> \n    <p>Then there were the jealousies that went hand-in-hand\
  \ with being family. His own brother-in-law, Faris, married to his sister, Sana,\
  \ made no secret of his envy. But Faris was a coward. He was the kind of man who\
  \ chose option one, getting drunk and blowing hot air, listing all of the tortures\
  \ he’d visit on Isra’s skin. But once the drink had worn off Faris would crawl back\
  \ under his stone. Isra had very little time for the man, but his sister seemed\
  \ to be taken in by his “charms.” They had a young son, Munir, who thought his father\
  \ could do no wrong, though the boy’s affection was not always returned. Invariably\
  \ when Isra went round to play the favorite uncle, Munir would end up with his arms\
  \ wrapped around the assassin’s legs, begging him not to go.</p> \n    <p>But if\
  \ it was one of this select group of suspects—friends and family—then from what\
  \ he knew of them, they were all more than capable of carrying out the killing themselves,\
  \ and would quite probably have enjoyed it. They certainly weren’t afraid of getting\
  \ their hands dirty. So that would have put them squarely in the option two category.\
  \ It all came down to means, motive, and opportunity. He couldn’t control means,\
  \ but the client certainly had them, as well as a motive. What he could control\
  \ was the opportunity.</p> \n    <p>Isra already had the first inklings of a plan\
  \ coming together in his mind. He needed to draw the knife for his would-be killer.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>It would need to be carefully orchestrated. But if he could manipulate\
  \ his enemy into attacking him, and make sure it happened in front of a whole host\
  \ of witnesses who would willingly testify to the seemingly unprovoked assault,\
  \ full of outrage and shock that one of their own could go bad, he could kill three\
  \ birds with the one proverbial stone.</p> \n    <p>Well, kill one bird—the client.\
  \ Safeguarding both his identity as the Nightwalker and the assassin’s untarnished\
  \ reputation were more like protecting the other two birds, if you were going to\
  \ be picky about it.</p> \n    <p>Of course it would have been a lot easier if he\
  \ knew who wanted him dead.</p> \n    <p></p>\n    <center>\n     ∗ ∗ ∗\n    </center>\n\
  \    <p></p> \n    <p>The social scene was such that two days was not considered\
  \ to be too short notice for a party; exclusivity demanded a certain amount of secrecy,\
  \ after all. Lavish banquets could be brought together in a matter of hours. But\
  \ then, with the market stalls filled to overflowing with every treat imaginable—\
  and many unimaginable—Katapesh was a gourmand’s paradise. The cost was of no concern.\
  \ Wealth necessitated a certain extravagance as far as Isra’s carefully cultivated\
  \ reputation was concerned.</p> \n    <p>Invitations had been dispatched to the\
  \ great and the good, the rich, the devious, the powerful and the influential—in\
  \ short, anyone who was anyone in the city received the enigmatic card with the\
  \ time, the date, and Isra Darzi’s crest. He liked the simplicity of it, treating\
  \ the invitation as a summons rather than a request. It appealed to his sense of\
  \ importance in terms of the social structure of the city. He was fairly certain\
  \ that whoever wanted him dead would be there, blindly oblivious to the fact that\
  \ they were the guests of honor.</p> \n    <p>Knowing the way the mind worked, Isra\
  \ was fairly safe in thinking that anyone who failed to attend could be ruled out.\
  \ Hosting the party—and a masquerade at that—was effectively painting a target on\
  \ his own back. The masks assured a level of anonymity that would make it so much\
  \ more difficult for any would-be killer to resist the chance to wield the knife\
  \ himself.</p> \n    <p>It all came down to managing the opportunity. Isra had to\
  \ ensure that each of his suspects had equal chance, not only to slit his throat,\
  \ but to get away with it—hence the masks. They offered the illusion of facelessness,\
  \ and in his experience cowards were braver when they didn’t think people could\
  \ see them.</p> \n    <p>The notion of a masked ball appealed to Isra’s sense of\
  \ humor. On the morning of the masquerade he had a second package delivered to each\
  \ of the four men he suspected of wanting him dead: animal masks. There was a different\
  \ one for each of his would-be killers, each reflecting his own thoughts on the\
  \ strengths and weaknesses of the recipient’s personality: a calopus, a jackal,\
  \ a lizard-skinned razorscale, and a mongrel dhabba in turn. It amused Isra to take\
  \ the joke a little further, and along with each mask was a note assuring the guest\
  \ that his host would be donning an ass’s head.</p> \n    <p>In fact, Isra had no\
  \ intention of actually being at the gala for more than a few minutes, and certainly\
  \ not in the guise of an ass. Yet such was the expectation when it came to Isra\
  \ Darzi, ever the joker, and the deception could only help with his shell game.\
  \ In reality, Isra would be far up above the party, lurking among the rafters or\
  \ in the shadows of the eaves. Watching. He had tethered his proverbial goat as\
  \ bait, now all he had to do was wait and see who came for it.</p> \n    <p></p>\n\
  \    <center>\n     ∗ ∗ ∗\n    </center>\n    <p></p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\"\

  \n    </div> \n    <p>Isra donned his mask. He had chosen to be a great black-feathered\
  \ bird. Guests were still arriving, and the chatter as they mingled was at first\
  \ muted, the music of the string orchestra swelling to fill the domed chamber, its\
  \ echo giving the notes a haunting quality as they swam around the animals below.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Dragon danced with camelopard, lion with janni and sand eel. Robbed of\
  \ their features, every woman was more beautiful simply by the grace of her movement,\
  \ the curve of hip and thigh, and the suppleness of her limbs as she moved across\
  \ the dance floor. Each man, on the other hand, seemed to take on the persona of\
  \ his chosen mask, the bulls pushing through the crowd, the pugwampis skirting the\
  \ edge and watching the women, the calopi prancing and the peacocks preening. Human\
  \ behavior never ceased to amaze Isra, and here, playing out beneath him on the\
  \ dance floor and around its skirts, was a perfect encapsulation of city life and\
  \ the social strata of Katapesh. The pig and the boar, he saw, gravitated to the\
  \ food, eating with their hands.</p> \n    <p>The music changed, the tempo picking\
  \ up. It was reflected on the dance floor with the animals moving gracefully from\
  \ partner to partner, taking hands, bowing heads, drawing bodies close in the anonymity\
  \ of their masks so that they might push up against each other in ways they never\
  \ would have dared without them. </p> \n    <p>The ass moved through the crowd,\
  \ tossing his head back and braying every now and then, before leading a swan onto\
  \ the dance floor. The ass assayed a bow, and then began a crudely amusing courtship\
  \ dance. For five minutes he was very much the center of attention. Isra took the\
  \ opportunity to slip down from the rafters, moving swiftly and surely to the balcony,\
  \ then from the balcony down into the press of bodies below. The mask was snug.\
  \ Sweat trickled down the back of his neck, mingling with the stitched feathers\
  \ to make a heady musk.</p> \n    <p>Isra moved freely amongst the assembled guest\
  \ without actually getting involved in conversation with anyone. After all, everyone\
  \ knew the ass was the host. No one wondered or cared about the great bird flitting\
  \ through their midst. He kept visual contact with his doppelganger, never letting\
  \ the ass’s head out of sight. He hadn’t prepped his stand-in beyond telling the\
  \ man to make sure he was seen, to play the gracious host, to flirt outrageously\
  \ with the women, and to carouse and make merry—meaning the actor had no idea quite\
  \ how much danger he was in. As long as he remained the centre of attention he’\
  d be relatively safe, though of course more than one assassin used the sheer exposed\
  \ nature of public gatherings and the press of the throng to cover his actions.\
  \ But those were professionals. Isra was dealing with ruthless businessmen here,\
  \ not ruthless killers, though they did share certain instincts. It was when Isra\
  \ gave the signal for the ass to move out onto the balcony, out of prying eyes,\
  \ that things could turn interesting. </p> \n    <p>Isra slipped out through the\
  \ balcony doors. He had driven three metal spikes into the wall to make a ladder.\
  \ Success or failure came down to preparation, and that meant controlling every\
  \ variable he could possibly control. He climbed them quickly, pressing his back\
  \ to the sandstone. He was gambling that any would-be assassin wouldn’t look up.\
  \ It was a safe bet. The killer would want to drive the knife home and get off the\
  \ balcony fast. Anything over a few seconds out there would increase the chance\
  \ of discovery.</p> \n    <p>The ass’s head lingered with a small group of women\
  \ for a while before making his excuses. The balcony doors opened, and the man came\
  \ through. He leaned on the balcony rail, taking the night air. It was a blessed\
  \ relief to be out here in the cool, and for once Isra found himself hoping it would\
  \ take the killer a while to pluck up the courage to do the deed, just so that he\
  \ could enjoy the relief from the sweaty heat of the ballroom. </p> \n    <p>No\
  \ one else came through the doors for five minutes, and then the only visitor was\
  \ a woman intent on getting him alone. She came up behind the ass’s head, wrapped\
  \ her arms around his waist and whispered something into his cauliflower ear. The\
  \ decoy brayed out a laugh, slapped the woman on her own ass and sent her scurrying\
  \ back into the ball.</p> \n    <p>Isra’s muscles began to cramp, but he’d spent\
  \ hours in worse situations. It was all about discipline and keeping the blood circulating.\
  \ He flexed and relaxed his thighs, working the individual muscles one at a time.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>He lingered a few minutes more, and with nothing happening was about\
  \ to give up on the fishing expedition and send the decoy back inside, ready to\
  \ believe that he’d been wrong, when the unmistakable head of the black jackal peered\
  \ in through the balcony arch. His brother-in-law, Faris.</p> \n    <p>Isra didn’\
  t move. He willed Faris to announce himself, to come out onto the balcony and slap\
  \ the ass heartily on the back, all good friends together. </p> \n    <p>Any hope\
  \ Isra still maintained was dispelled by Faris’s single furtive glance. The jackal\
  \ gave a signal to someone else behind him, then disappeared back into the crowd\
  \ of revelers. The music swelled again, then lowered, partygoers whooping and cheering\
  \ as the belly dancers began. The bells on their hips and toes and wrists replaced\
  \ the strings, creating an entirely new melody.</p> \n    <p>A woman, wearing the\
  \ head of a meerkat, slipped out through the door and onto the balcony. There was\
  \ nothing seductive about her movement, and she clearly had no intention of flirting\
  \ with the ass. It took Isra a heartbeat to realize Faris’ game: he had bought another\
  \ assassin with him.</p> \n    <p>Isra slipped down from his perch without so much\
  \ as a whisper from the fabric of his clothing, and half-stepped, half-stumbled\
  \ deliberately into the meerkat’s back, pushing her off balance, then grasping at\
  \ her as though to hold himself up, just a moment before her blade would have plunged\
  \ into his stand-in’s back. The meerkat cried out in surprise, losing her balance,\
  \ but before she could react, Isra swept her feet out from beneath her and dropped\
  \ onto her back, driving his knee into the base of her spine, hard. He cuffed her\
  \ around the temple with the hilt of his knife with enough force to leave her reeling,\
  \ and then looked up at the confused decoy. </p> \n    <p>“She's drunk,” Isra said.\
  \ “I will take care of her. You’ve done well, but you can go now.”</p> \n    <p>The\
  \ ass nodded, maintaining the silence he’d been paid for, and went back inside to\
  \ enjoy the gyrations of the belly dancers. It was the way of things. He had done\
  \ what he had been paid for, no more, no less, and no explanations were needed.\
  \ After all, he had no idea that Isra been playing the part of guardian angel, nor\
  \ how close the assassin’s blade had come.</p> \n    <p>Isra slipped his hands beneath\
  \ the meerkat’s mask and pulled it off to get a proper look at the woman. He didn’\
  t recognize her, but her pale complexion marked her as an outsider. The fear was\
  \ only evident in her eyes, and she was quickly mastering that.</p> \n    <p>Isra\
  \ bent down so that his face was only inches from her ear, and whispered, “Do you\
  \ know who I am?”</p> \n    <p>The woman didn’t try to move—not that she could have\
  \ with his weight pressing down on her.</p> \n    <p>“I am Isra Darzi,” he said,\
  \ slipping the blackbird mask from his face. He placed it on the floor next to her\
  \ mask. He saw the momentary realization flicker through her eyes. He was the mark,\
  \ and she’d been fooled into showing her hand. </p> \n    <p>“Yes,” he whispered,\
  \ nodding. “But I am also so much more than that. You might know me by another name.\
  \ They call me the Nightwalker.”</p> \n    <p>The woman struggled desperately, wriggling\
  \ around like a worm beneath him, but no matter how fiercely she fought him, she\
  \ couldn’t free herself from the pressure of Isra's knee in the base of her spine.\
  \ </p> \n    <p>She tried to cry out, but the assassin pressed her face so hard\
  \ to the floor that she could barely spit out a muffled groan, and that was more\
  \ than drowned out by the cheers for the belly dancers. </p> \n    <p>Isra grasped\
  \ a tangle of the woman’s hair, yanking her head back, and then leaned in close,\
  \ like a lover, wrapping his free hand around her neck and up beside her jaw. He\
  \ didn’t say a word as he released her hair and brought his hand around to cup her\
  \ other cheek. He gave both a sharp twist. She twitched, dead nerves giving one\
  \ last command to her muscles, bucking beneath him, and lay still. </p> \n    <p>He\
  \ had been taught the technique as a child, killing chickens for the kitchen table.\
  \ There wasn’t much different between the physiognomy of the species when it came\
  \ to their necks and the damage breaking them caused. Killing, done properly, was\
  \ about ending life, not enjoying the suffering of the victim.</p> \n    <p>Isra\
  \ slipped the bird mask back onto the dead woman and picked up the discarded mask\
  \ that she had been wearing. </p> \n    <p>Faris would be looking for her to re-join\
  \ the festivities, and despite the obvious biological differences, Isra and the\
  \ woman were actually a similar build, so if he moved quickly there was every chance\
  \ he might pass for her as he slipped back into the crowd of bodies. </p> \n   \
  \ <p>But first he had to dispose of the corpse.</p> \n    <p>He pitched the dead\
  \ woman off the balcony, wincing at the crash it made as it landed in the bushes,\
  \ and turned to go back inside. </p> \n    <p>Isra caught the briefest glimpse of\
  \ someone rushing away from the balcony doors. Someone who wasn’t supposed to have\
  \ been at the masquerade. Someone that may well have witnessed everything. Someone\
  \ who, more tellingly, might well have heard everything... </p> \n    <p>That in\
  \ itself wouldn’t have been cause for undue concern. Loose ends could always be\
  \ tied up. But Isra knew it wasn’t going to be that simple. He couldn’t believe\
  \ the damned fool Faris had brought Munir—his own son, and Isra’s nephew—with him\
  \ to the party.</p> \n    <p>Isra really didn’t want to have to kill the boy. </p>\
  \ \n    <p>But, all things considered, he would happily wring his brother-in-law’\
  s neck.</p> \n    <p><b>Coming Next Week:</b> Threats and promises in Chapter Three\
