  >Well met, adventurers! I travel here from the far-off lands of Hero Lab, bringing\
  \ good tidings for GMs and players alike. Sit by the fire and heed my tales, and\
  \ you shall discover how Hero Lab makes it easier to run your games!</p> \n    \

  \ \n     <p>As a GM who's been running Pathfinder and its forebears for almost 20\
  \ years, I'm always on the lookout for new ideas and stories to share with my players.\
  \ Luckily, Paizo has the answer -Pathfinder's Adventure Paths have become indispensable\
  \ tools for GMs like me, with nearly 100 pages of story, background information,\
  \ and combat encounters released every month. We already include player content\
  \ from each Adventure Path for free, and we're excited to announce that we're now\
  \ bringing the encounters to Hero Lab!</p> \n     <p>The first Adventure Path up\
  \ for release is the classic <em>Rise of the Runelords Anniversary Edition</em>.\
  \ This new add-on package for Hero Lab gives you everything you need to run the\
  \ combat encounters from <em>Rise of the Runelords</em>, including full details\
  \ for every NPC and monster—even those referenced from other sourcebooks.</p> \n\
  \     <p>That means if a monster comes from the <em>Bestiary</em>, or an NPC uses\
  \ a class from <em>Ultimate Combat</em> or gear from <em>Ultimate Equipment</em>,\
  \ no problem! Hero Lab provides all the information you need to run the encounters,\
  \ all included in this one convenient package. No more worrying about whether you\
  \ have the right books or Hero Lab packages, or looking up statblocks during the\
  \ game—this new package provides everything you need for use in all the <em>Rise\
  \ of the Runelords</em> encounters. Every encounter and NPC is available to view,\
  \ print, or use within Hero Lab's integrated Tactical Console.</p> \n     <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20150424-HL-Tactical.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20150424-HL-Tactical_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>And there's more! Are your players over- or under-levelled,\
  \ or has an extra player unexpectedly dropped in to your game? Hero Lab has you\
  \ covered - not only are all the Adventure Path encounters pre-built and ready to\
  \ use, you can customize them to your heart's content by bumping up (or down) each\
  \ adversary's challenge rating in seconds. With just a few clicks, you can add and\
  \ remove templates, class levels, or even entire groups of enemies with our built-in\
  \ Encounter Builder. Hero Lab automatically recalculates all the NPC and monster\
  \ stats based on your changes, and the encounter is ready for use in seconds.</p>\
