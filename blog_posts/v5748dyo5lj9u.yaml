  \ \"Why is Jason Keeley giving me a saucy look?\" The answer is that that's his\
  \ best captain's expression, thank you very much! As the developer in charge of\
  \ polishing and expanding the starship rules (originally written by Jason Bulmahn),\
  \ Jason K. currently spends a lot of time alone in the conference room, battling\
  \ himself in epic starship battles, depicted here by shark and goblin pawns. It's\
  \ lonely out there, constantly dying in space, but his suffering is necessary to\
  \ make sure the starship construction rules are balanced.</p> \n    <p>Oh, did I\
  \ forget to mention that in <a href=\"/starfinder\">Starfinder</a>, you'll be able\
  \ to build and customize your own starship? It's true. In addition to a robust starship\
  \ combat system including different roles for each player (you can see some examples\
  \ of the special maneuvers called pilot stunts illustrated there in the foreground),\
  \ there's also a thorough system by which both players and GMs can upgrade their\
  \ starships with new weapons, power cores, and other advanced systems. We've said\
  \ since the beginning that we think the best starships are practically characters\
  \ in their own right—the Millennium Falcon, the Serenity, etc.—so we wanted to make\
  \ sure that players could customize their ships and make them unique, while also\
  \ allowing GM to craft tons of unique foes.</p> \n    <p>Did we succeed? You'll\
  \ have to tell us, but I have great confidence that the Jasons can... ahem... make\
  \ it so.*</p> \n    <p>James L. Sutter<br> <i>Creative Director</i></p> \n    <p\
  \ class=\"tiny\">*Yeah, I know I made a Picard joke when Jason's clearly doing a\
  \ Captain Kirk impression. Deal with it.</p> \n   </div> <!-- tags: Starfinder Roleplaying\
