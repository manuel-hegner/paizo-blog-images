  \ Kevin Andrew Murphy</p> \n   <h2>Chapter Three: The Garland of Eglantine</h2>\
  \ \n   <p>The innwife woke me at dawn. I’d spent the night beside the fire. Someone\
  \ had picked my pocket during the night, so the gold Norret had given me was gone.\
  \ All I had left was the little horn spoon.</p> \n   <p>The innwife made it clear\
  \ that if I bought breakfast or even ale, I could stay, but if not, I should go.\
  \ I left, stepping out into the cold morning.</p> \n   <p>Cries of “Gardyloo!” came\
  \ from up and down the street. Maids and goodwives threw open windows, emptying\
  \ chamber pots. Piss and night soil spattered the cobbles, running down to the grate\
  \ that led to the sewers below. Horrible stories were told about those sewers, but\
  \ nothing could be more awful than the stench. I wished I had one of the paper nosegays\
  \ Norret and I had spent hours making, but had to make do with the woodsmoke on\
  \ my clothes.</p> \n   <p>A moment later, I realized I was crying.</p> \n   <p>I\
  \ bit my lip and forced the tears back. Life in Galt was harsh, and I had no illusions.\
  \ Madame Eglantine was a witch, and she’d warned us not to pry into her business.\
  \ What that business was, I could only guess. Summoning devils like the vile Chelaxians?\
  \ Worshiping nightmares from beyond the stars? Smuggling nobles out of Galt?</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Whatever it was, it was awful enough that my brother had decided to do\
  \ something about it. But the witch had won.</p> \n   <p>How she had won was the\
  \ question. My brother could be injured, dead, drugged, or even turned into a toad\
  \ for the witch to feed flies and taunt.</p> \n   <p>Given Madame Eglantine’s ties\
  \ with the Revolutionary Council, the cruelest possibility was that he would join\
  \ the next cart of condemned to feed the guillotine.</p> \n   <p>The window of the\
  \ uppermost gable of the house at the top of the street popped open and a familiar\
  \ female voice cried out a warning. The night soil flew down and the window snapped\
  \ shut, the little diamond panes frosted from the inside to ensure the old woman’\
  s privacy.</p> \n   <p>She was unusually late. Normally Madame Eglantine would have\
  \ done this before dawn, giving her time to go down to the kitchen and fix breakfast\
  \ for the guests.</p> \n   <p>I steeled my courage and made my way back to the familiar\
  \ house. I slipped in as one of the other boarders stepped out—the old wizard Norret\
  \ had got the manuscript from, off to take his morning constitutional before returning\
  \ for breakfast.</p> \n   <p>The rooms Norret and I had shared were bare as when\
  \ we moved in. The only change was a pile of ashes in the grate. The air smelled\
  \ strongly of irises and alchemist’s fire.</p> \n   <p>I made my way to the dining\
  \ room. The other boarders greeted me kindly, inquiring as to when Norret would\
  \ be by and how his research was going. I shrugged. The old wizard returned shortly,\
  \ reeking of cherry tobacco and snuff.</p> \n   <p>A half-hour late, Madame Eglantine\
  \ came in, bearing a tray heavy with pork pies and mirabelle plums. “My pardon,\
  \ gentlemen. There will be no croissants this morning. I missed the baker’s boy\
  \ when—”</p> \n   <p>“Where’s my brother?”</p> \n   <p>The old witch looked at me,\
  \ shocked, but quickly regained her composure. “My dear child, you’re still here?\
  \ I thought you left with him last night. Your brother gave notice and cleaned out\
  \ all his things.”</p> \n   <p>“I waited at the tavern. He never came.”</p> \n \
  \  <p>A look passed among the guests, a sad one, and the old wizard turned to me\
  \ and said, “Did he leave you no money?”</p> \n   <p>“A little. My pocket was picked.”\
  </p> \n   <p>There were more sad looks and tut-tutting. The old wizard produced\
  \ a few silver coins and pressed them into my hand. “You must take care of yourself\
  \ now, Orlin.”</p> \n   <p>Madame agreed. “I’m not in the business of charity. You’\
  re welcome to stay for breakfast, but you’re almost a grown man. Inquire at the\
  \ workhouse, or perhaps with the army.”</p> \n   <p>“My brother would not abandon\
  \ me.”</p> \n   <p>She looked very sad, but it was an actress’s look from a melodrama,\
  \ a practiced expression of grief that had nothing to do with the cold glittering\
  \ little black eyes behind the half-moon spectacles. “I’m sorry, but you are not\
  \ the first child in Isarn to believe that, nor will you be the last.”</p> \n  \
  \ <p>“People are only human,” the old wizard agreed sadly.</p> \n   <p>I did not\
  \ mention that my brother had given up a fortune to bring me back to life. I only\
  \ burst into tears and ran from that house, unable to think how to save Norret.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>I had no way of knowing that he was not already dead. But if you’re from\
  \ Galt, you know that the only <i>truly</i> final death comes from one of the Final\
  \ Blades.</p> \n   <p>No one knows that better than myself. Even coming back wrong\
  \ is better than not coming back at all.</p> \n   <p>My handkerchief fluttered out\
  \ of my pocket, drying my tears without me touching it. <br> “Th-thank you, Rhodel,”\
  \ I snuffled, retrieving it. I blew my nose and put it away.</p> \n   <p>I still\
  \ had hope. The witch had gone with the lie that Norret had abandoned me, not that\
  \ he’d pried into whatever awful thing went on in her attic. That meant that she’\
  d have trouble having him arrested and sent off to meet Madame Margaery.</p> \n\
  \   <p>The Gray Gardeners always asked questions, sometimes even after people died.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>I thought about what I knew of Madame Eglantine. The only way into her\
  \ apartment was the door at the end of the upstairs hall, set with many locks and\
  \ charms. Once I’d glimpsed a spiral stair beyond it, thick with cobwebs. I could\
  \ only guess that there would be another door with far more dangerous locks at the\
  \ top of the stair. All the windows locked from the inside. To get up to the gables\
  \ would mean scaling three stories and a slate roof. The boarding house also had\
  \ a climbing rose—an eglantine, like its owner. The vine was heavy with little white\
  \ blossoms, thick with thorns, and infested with famished bees, the fat little garden\
  \ spiders that preyed upon them, and the wasps that preyed upon them in turn.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Madame only left her attic to fix breakfast and supper, meet with tradesmen,\
  \ and tend her beloved garden. The only time she left the house was to attend an\
  \ execution, which was a general holiday. That was also the only time the cook fires\
  \ were banked.</p> \n   <p>I saw a halfling walking down the street. He was wearing\
  \ a short cap and a pair of heavy gloves, and had a wire brush over his shoulder.\
  \ The only parts of him that weren’t covered with soot were the gilded buttons on\
  \ his coat.</p> \n   <p>I stepped into his path. “Teach me your trade.”</p> \n \
  \  <p>The halfling looked up at me and laughed. “Not that I ain’t always lookin’\
  \ fer apprentices, but ye’re too tall, lad, and y’look like ye’re gonna get a dem\
  \ site bigger before ye’re done.” He then turned more serious. “Parents tossed ye\
  \ out? Tell y’wot. Y’can touch me buttons fer luck fer free and be on yer way with\
  \ me best wishes. Sound right?”</p> \n   <p>“How about I buy you a glass of wine\
  \ and you tell me about your trade?”</p> \n   <p>“Halfling size or human size?”\
  </p> \n   <p>“Your choice.”</p> \n   <p>He grinned. “That’d be halfling size. It’\
  s bigger.”</p> \n   <p>I ended up buying the whole bottle with a couple of the wizard’\
  s silver pieces, but found I what I needed to know. Most of what I needed I already\
  \ had—a cap and a pair of stout gloves. What I didn’t have, I didn’t need either.\
  \ I had no interest in cleaning Madame Eglantine’s chimney, with or without a wire\
  \ brush.</p> \n   <p>The halfling did an excellent impression of the mistress of\
  \ the boarding house: “‘Yes, citizen, I am quite aware of the perils of chimney\
  \ fires. Be that as it may, I have spells to clean my chimney, and I’m more limber\
  \ than I appear. Indeed, I think you’d be quite surprised at how small a space I\
  \ can fit into...’” He snorted. “Nasty old harridan. Lost a few snakesmen to her\
  \ back in the day. Steer clear of that one if’n y’know what’s good.”</p> \n   <p>“\
  Snakesmen?”</p> \n   <p>“Burglars,” the halfling confessed drunkenly. “Second-story\
  \ men. Never seen hide nor hair of ’em ag’in. Bet she turned ’em inta mice an’ fed\
  \ ’em to the cat.”</p> \n   <p>Feeding someone to a familiar was awful magic, but\
  \ Madame Eglantine did not have a cat that I knew of. The only pets Madame appeared\
  \ to have were garden spiders.</p> \n   <p>There were a great many of them in the\
  \ garlands of eglantine that twined around the boarding house. I climbed the rose\
  \ the next day, after watching Madame and half her boarders leave for the executions.\
  \ I couldn’t believe my luck—the windows of Norret’s and my old rooms had been left\
  \ open to air. They still smelled very strongly of iris.</p> \n   <p>I brushed the\
  \ little spiders from my clothes, then went to the fireplace. It was still warm.\
  \ The hearth fire had been banked in the kitchen. But not for long.</p> \n   <p>I\
  \ took the wine bottle from the inn, reached up the flue, and dropped it down the\
  \ chimney.</p> \n   <p>There was dim tinkle and the sound of a small explosion.\
  \ Norret had taught me the formula for extinguisher grenades. It had taken the last\
  \ of the wizard’s silver at the apothecary, but was worth it.</p> \n   <p>I waited\
  \ for the fumes to clear, then stuck my head up the flue. It was dark, and soot\
  \ drifted down over my face. I did as the chimneysweep had told me. I tied my scarf\
  \ over my face and pulled my cap low over my eyes, then worked my way up slowly.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>There were handholds in the brick, but the safest way up was bracing my\
  \ back against the back of the chimney and my feet against the front. I wormed my\
  \ way upward, higher and higher, until I found the next flue, the one that led to\
  \ Madame Eglantine’s attic apartment.</p> \n   <p>I came down carefully, expecting\
  \ that I might step directly into a cauldron, but her fireplace only had an iron\
  \ hook at the back. It held a slab of Madame’s delicious bacon smoking over the\
  \ hob. Another hook held a kettle for Madame’s tea. The fire was out save for a\
  \ few banked coals, but the ashes smelled of applewood.</p> \n   <div class=\"blurb360\"\

  \    <br> \"Madame Eglantine is more than she appears.\"\n   </div> \n   <p>I moved\
  \ the fire screen aside and ducked out into the apartment, shaking the soot off\
  \ onto the hearthrug. The apartment was the most cobwebbed place I’d ever seen.\
  \ Madame might want her guests to tidy up after themselves, but had clearly never\
  \ seen fit to clean her own rooms. What I had taken for frosted glass was a thick\
  \ film of cobwebs on the inside of all the windows. It made the light far dimmer\
  \ than day, but still brighter than it had been in the chimney.</p> \n   <p>There\
  \ were cases of books and bric-a-brac, shelves containing the oddments and curios\
  \ of a lifetime. Then I turned and saw the mantel. My heart stopped cold.</p> \n\
  \   <p>Where a scholar might keep the bust of a great philosopher, or an artist\
  \ might place a single skull for still lifes, Madame Eglantine had done them one\
  \ better. On the mantel was a row of bell jars like you’d use for growing vegetables\
  \ or protecting mantel clocks. But under each jar was a severed head, preserved\
  \ by magic or alchemy, fresh as they day they were chopped. Their eyes were wide\
  \ and staring, their mouths half open. I expected them to start speaking any moment.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>They did not, but as I stumbled away, I wished they had, for they could\
  \ have warned me not to look at what I saw next.</p> \n   <p>Stretched out on a\
  \ table was a corpse—without its head, without its hands, without a great many parts.\
  \ At first I thought Madame Eglantine must be an anatomy student or necromancer,\
  \ but then I saw the chart, like a doctor might use, but marked like a butcher’\
  s with notes like <i>brisket</i> and <i>good for paté</i>. I realized that Madame\
  \ Eglantine must be some horrible hag or ogre wife like in the stories. Suddenly\
  \ the bacon hanging on the hob didn’t seem so appealing.</p> \n   <p>Then I saw\
  \ Norret.</p> \n   <p>He was poisoned. I sensed it immediately. He was hanging in\
  \ a great spiderweb strung in one corner. I rushed to him, but before I touched\
  \ him, I stopped, remembering the terrible stickiness of such webs from the bard’\
  s stories. I ran and got the fireplace poker and used it to rip the webs away.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>He was still alive, but paralyzed and poisoned. And it was then that I\
  \ sensed poison again. But this poison was moving.</p> \n   <p>It was a spider.\
  \ A garden spider like the little ones in the roses outside, squat and brown and\
  \ marked with a cross like a festival cake frosted to keep pixies from dancing on\
  \ it. But this spider was the size of a crab.</p> \n   <p>It scuttled toward me.\
  \ I smashed it with the fireplace poker, hitting it with the hook. It hissed like\
  \ a pastry dropped into hot fat and scuttled away. I stepped back. Then the hearth\
  \ broom levitated, swatting at it—Rhodel trying to help, but only swatting it on\
  \ the backside.</p> \n   <p>It leapt at me.</p> \n   <p>I swung the poker, but it\
  \ went wild. I lost my grip, the iron bar striking one of the bell jars.</p> \n\
  \   <p>It shattered. The head bowled across the floor, eyes blinking.</p> \n   <p>I\
  \ caught the spider. It bit at me, drooling poison, but my gloves were stout. I\
  \ shoved it against the mantel with one hand. With the other, I reached for my belt\
  \ knife, hoping to stab it. My hand closed around something smaller than expected,\
  \ and I realized that I had grabbed the little horn spoon instead.</p> \n   <p>It\
  \ didn’t matter. The handle was ivory and pointed, and had come from a unicorn.\
  \ I jammed it in, point first, again and again, stabbing it over and over until\
  \ the horrible monster vomited blancmange. It died with a shudder.</p> \n   <p>I\
  \ was crying again. I went and got the poker and used it to rip the webs away from\
  \ Norret. Somewhere in his gear he had a jewel that had once belonged to Dabril’\
  s duke, a magic ruby set in a glove that could neutralize poison. If I could just\
  \ find it, I might heal him, and we could both escape this chamber of horrors.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>“I believe,” said a voice behind me, “you are looking for this.”</p> \n\
  \   <p>I turned. Madame Eglantine stood framed in the doorway, taking Norret’s jeweled\
  \ glove out of her knitting bag.</p> \n   <p><b>Coming Next Week:</b> Further horrors\
