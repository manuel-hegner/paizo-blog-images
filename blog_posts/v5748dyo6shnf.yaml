  \ April as the National Autism Awareness Month in the US and of April 2nd as World\
  \ Autism Awareness Day, we wanted to take a moment to talk about autism and gaming.\
  \ For this, we reached out to our friends at Game to Grow, a 501(c)(3) non-profit\
  \ organization dedicated to the use of games for therapeutic, educational, and community\
  \ growth. Game to Grow’s weekly therapeutic social skills groups help approximately\
  \ 150 participants each week around the world become more confident, creative, and\
  \ socially capable using games of all kinds. Participants are frequently working\
  \ on social challenges associated with autism, ADHD, social anxiety, or depression.\
  \ Playing games in a safe, supportive, and fun environment helps them build meaningful,\
  \ supportive friendships while developing valuable skills to flourish socially on\
  \ their own terms. In addition to group services, Game to Grow's comprehensive training\
  \ program empowers mental health professionals, educators, and community advocates\
  \ around the world to use innovative game-based strategies to enrich their own communities.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>There are many different intersections between autism and gaming. In\
  \ this blog, we’re highlighting the personal experience of three individuals associated\
  \ with Game to Grow: a client who uses the program, the volunteer coordinator of\
  \ Game to Grow, and one of their trainees. We thank each of them for sharing their\
  \ stories with our gaming community. Game to Grow founder and Executive Director\
  \ Adam Davis and his staff have created supporting and nurturing environments for\
  \ all players, as well as developing training for Game Masters and industry professionals\
  \ to support individuals with autism. For more information on Game to Grow and how\
  \ you can get involved, visit <a href=\"http://www.gametogrow.org/\" target=\"_blank\"\

  \ <br> \n     <p>For this occasion, I’d love to talk about autistic representation\
  \ in games or the benefits of role-playing games to neurodiverse people—but, being\
  \ autistic with a penchant for deep dives into subjects of interest, there is no\
  \ way I can satisfactorily cover that in the 500 odd words available. Instead, I’\
  m going to share a simple but effective intervention that can be used at any table,\
  \ and which can have a big positive impact for all players, with some unique advantages\
  \ for autistic ones. Full credit to the wonderful folks over at Game to Grow, who\
  \ taught most of my group this technique when we were attending a therapeutic GM\
  \ training</p> \n     <p>In my wonderful roleplaying group, we start each session\
  \ with a check-in question asked by the GM. This can be literally almost anything—\
  last time we played it <em>was what is your favorite bird</em>? But it could just\
  \ as well have been <em>what’s a childhood memory you would like to change? Or if\
  \ you could have a conversation with anyone at all, who would you choose?</em></p>\
  \ \n     <p>We, the players, answer for ourselves, and—when applicable—also for\
  \ our characters. Depending on the question, the insights here can be profound,\
  \ intriguing, or hilarious. Our dwarf barbarian’s favorite bird is a sparrow because\
  \ <em>they’re small, a bit grungy, and always willing to take on something bigger\
  \ than themselves</em>, much like him. </p> \n     <p>When we have put down the\
  \ dice for the evening, everyone answers two more questions, and these are the same\
  \ every session. First, everyone gives a highlight to another player for making\
  \ their session awesome, and second—this one is the kicker—everyone shares something\
  \ that was challenging about the session, or something they’ve learned.</p> \n \
  \    <p>So why is this a good thing for me as an autistic gamer?</p> \n     <p>Firstly,\
  \ this ritual creates a social space where it is not only allowed but <em>encouraged</em>\
  \ for every player to share their unique perspective on the game, and to express\
  \ when something has been difficult. For me as an autistic who sometimes needs to\
  \ ask for support or accommodation, this helps level the playing field, so to speak,\
  \ and creates a structured way for me to express things that are challenging when\
  \ they happen. The repetitive nature and timing of the questions also help me feel\
  \ less anxious about speaking up in a social context. Finally, asking and answering\
  \ these questions facilitates honest, authentic communication, which is not only\
  \ great for me as an autistic who struggles with small talk and polite pretense,\
  \ but in a very real way brings the whole group closer together. Some of the best\
  \ times we’ve had as a group have been the hour-long conversations after the sessions,\
  \ which grow organically out of the tone and intention set by the check-in and -out\
  \ questions.</p> \n     <p>All told, it’s an exercise in connection and trust which\
  \ helps me as an autistic bridge the gap that can sometimes be present between myself\
  \ and neurotypical fellow players and feel like an equal and valued member of the\
  \ group. For me, that’s the best part. </p> \n     <p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\

  \  <br> \n     <p>Saroc the Bard is an excellent negotiator. I, on the other hand,\
  \ am not. Saroc the Bard is an amazing wordsmith. I continually struggle to find\
  \ the right expressions. Playing RPGs has helped me understand Autism and myself\
  \ by teaching me better conversation skills, self-advocacy, and learning social\
  \ cues. For my entire life, it has been difficult for me to have a decent conversation\
  \ with people as I have a tendency to ramble. Playing RPGs has helped me get better\
  \ at the balance of back and forth talking that good conversations require and neurotypical\
  \ people take for granted. Various RPGs have also taught me how important and easy\
  \ it is to stand up for myself. By practicing in the controlled environment of an\
  \ RPG, I have learned to have the confidence to tell someone how I am truly feeling\
  \ or to stop them when they’ve interrupted me. I have also learned how to identify\
  \ certain social cues, like when someone wants to talk, or is feeling uncomfortable.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>Living with Autism has given me a unique ability to do some things\
  \ that other people find difficult, like finding solutions from multiple angles.\
  \ Having these abilities has come at a social and emotional cost. Though it is easy\
  \ for me to make friends, it’s often difficult for me to be aware of how my behavior\
  \ affects them. I have often felt alone, even when I’m with my friends. But playing\
  \ RPGs has helped me find people like me; I don’t have to deal with Autism by myself.\
  \ I have been able to see the positives in what I am capable of doing, instead of\
  \ focusing on the negatives of what I’m incapable of doing. Playing RPGs has made\
  \ coping with the chaos of the world much easier by giving me problems I am easily\
  \ able to solve. Because of this, I am able to find solutions to my real-world problems.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Autism is a spectrum disorder, and even two people with the same diagnosis,\
  \ like Asperger’s, process the world very differently. RPGs allow for a wide variety\
  \ of characters; thus, anyone can find a character that fits them. Something that\
  \ is amazing about RPGs is that people can write the backstories for their characters.\
  \ Being able to include skills my character has that I’ve wanted has made learning\
  \ those skills easier, like communicating, negotiating, and self-respect. Learning\
  \ these skills in a group that won’t judge me for making mistakes has made playing\
  \ more fun and enjoyable. Since I started playing Saroc 4 years ago, I have learned,\
  \ quite honestly, to love myself.</p> \n     <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight:\

  \ name is Shawna Spain, but my online handle is likesevenspoon. I was diagnosed\
  \ as Autistic in my mid-twenties, and my reactions were a mix of relief that I knew\
  \ what was wrong with me, finally, and a kind of anger that my brain was so different\
  \ that I couldn't be \"normal.\" It's been about a decade, and I finally don't feel\
  \ a desire to be normal—I am happy being me. I am pretty awesome. </p> \n     <p>When\
  \ I was first diagnosed, my doctor encouraged me to engage in structured social\
  \ activities and when I was like, how even do you do that, he suggested I invite\
  \ people over for board games. So, I joined a TTRPG game, and played board games\
  \ with people and felt a comfort in those interactions because there are RULES.\
  \ And everyone just agrees to follow them. Which is like real life, except unlike\
  \ real life, the rules for these games are written down. Which is awesome. I finally\
  \ found a world where my brain was less of a hindrance and more of a great thing.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>I am a great storyteller, and the framework of the game gives me\
  \ a place to relax and have energy to tell those stories. That means a lot to me.\
  \ I can exist in a space for all humans and have fun and meaningful relationships.\
  \ I can be successful at things, learn things, and play. For someone who grew up\
  \ branded a weirdo, made fun of for the way I talked, got into fights when someone\
  \ called me stupid, this is a whole new world. I belong alongside all of these other\
  \ humans who want to play a game and participate in the collaborative telling of\
  \ a story. I can practice skill sets that I can use in other parts of my life. After\
  \ all, being the GM of a game is often using skills that a manager would need in\
  \ their real-life job. Think about it. There are objectives, and you need to get\
  \ a group of people to complete them. You need to make it engaging and fun and set\
  \ everyone up to be a success. Same skill set. </p> \n     <p>I want more people\
  \ to play TTRPGs. I want them to be safe spaces for the Neurodivergent community.\
  \ I want more Autistics to be able to learn the same things I have, and feel the\
  \ same confidence, and find friends and joy.</p> \n     <p style=\"margin-left:\
