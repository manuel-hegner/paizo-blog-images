  \     <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\">We are fully recovered from\
  \ our first marathon of <em>Sky King’s Tomb</em> and ready to tell the tale! If\
  \ you didn’t catch the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo70oix?The-Sky-Scions\"\
  >introduction</a> to this project, we’re playing as a family of dwarves from Clan\
  \ Firecask, complete with different generations to represent our players’ out-of-game\
  \ ages. Each marathon of this project also features Order of the Amber Die members\
  \ from decades past, and for our opening marathon we reached all the way back to\
  \ the 1980s when our group first began. Before co-founding the Order with our GM,\
  \ Andrew Woodworth and Adam went as Darth Vader and a stormtrooper for Halloween\
  \ in 1985; they even have the same birthday and grew up as neighbors in New Jersey.\
  \ Andy stayed active in the Order until the 2000s, and returned to the table for\
  \ the first time in twenty years for this marathon – his debut playing Pathfinder!</p>\n\
  \      <p>Joining us as a guest for this marathon was Brandon Gillam of Runehammer,\
  \ who played as Renck Firecask, a venerable scribe, tattoo artist, and keeper of\
  \ clan recipes. Brandon held his own in Pathfinder 2E and lasted to <a href=\"https://www.runehammer.online/post/the-o-a-d-epiphany\"\
  >share the story</a> of his first Amber Die marathon. Having an artist along for\
  \ the ride meant that many of the scenes from our playthrough were sketched out\
  \ as they happened, so we’ve included our favorite piece with this blog!</p>\n \
  \     <ul>\n       <li><strong>Adventure</strong>: <em>Mantle of Gold</em></li>\n\
  \       <li><strong>Marathon Length</strong>: 59 hours</li>\n       <li><strong>Session\
  \ Hours</strong>: 32 hours</li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>Our journey began in the\
  \ undisputed center of dwarven culture: the Sky Citadel of Highhelm. When we sat\
  \ down at the table, each of us had a folder waiting for us with our character’\
  s name on it. Inside, our GM had placed four high-quality maps printed from the\
  \ <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02ehs?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Highhelm\"\
  >Highhelm hardcover</a>; each map depicted one level of the city: King’s Crown,\
  \ King’s Heart, Stonebreach, and The Depths. For the entirety of our marathon, we\
  \ never left the city and never wanted to. We toured some sites that even a family\
  \ of dwarves who grew up in Highhelm hadn’t seen before, and enjoyed the massive\
  \ sandbox that this adventure offers. Our goal was to build our clan’s reputation\
  \ higher before an important festival, and we counted at least a dozen quests that\
  \ we completed in that pursuit.</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a\

  \     <h2><strong>Highlights from <em>Mantle of Gold</em>:</strong></h2>\n     \
  \ <p>□ As Highhelm is the most influential of Sky Citadels, it is connected to the\
  \ rest of Golarion in ways that make languages essential, and tutors are always\
  \ in demand. Disa Firecask, known to us as “Mama Disa,” volunteered to become a\
  \ language instructor at a prestigious school in King’s Crown. Teaching the children\
  \ of Goldhilt clans is taken seriously, and Disa was expected to submit lesson plans,\
  \ a pacing guide, and closely follow the curriculum. Disa is a cleric of Folgrit,\
  \ so the children loved her—yet the stern headmaster insisted on evaluating her\
  \ skills in the classroom. Disa dropped THREE natural 20s across four rolls to become\
  \ Teacher of the Month!&nbsp;</p>\n      <p>□ We were made aware of a problem at\
  \ the Cloudspire Embassy, an important location that secures the connection between\
  \ Avistan and Garund’s dwarves. Upon arriving, we were told that a cloud dragon\
  \ brought from Garund for protection was not adjusting well to the caverns of its\
  \ new home. This dragon, Mharsilekinass the Jewel, presented a challenge we were\
  \ not wholly prepared for: something akin to a bored teenager. After finding pleasure\
  \ in ambushing us (with initiative rolled), the dragon challenged us to a game of\
  \ <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02eh8?Pathfinder-Elemental-Stones\">Elemental\
  \ Stones</a>; if we won, it agreed to behave, but if we lost, we had to amuse the\
  \ dragon for a week. We stopped our session, broke out the board game, and our GM\
  \ proceeded to defeat us. Renck Firecask, our bard, stepped up to entertain. A week\
  \ later, Renck and “Mharzy” had something to show us: a neck tattoo worthy of a\
  \ wyrm!</p>\n      <p>□ The sport of basilisk is appreciated in Highhelm in a way\
  \ that the Philadelphia Eagles fans around our table can identify with. When a star\
  \ player for the Highhelm Hodags had to drop from the team’s roster, our chances\
  \ of winning the Avistan Championship were in jeopardy. Tryouts were held, with\
  \ siblings Thorgreigir and Salthrun Firecask in attendance. While Thorgreigir clutched\
  \ his rolls and made the team, he now had to perform in front of the whole city.\
  \ We were down by a score for most of the contest, but with our GM blasting the\
  \ dwarven version of “Seven Nation Army” and crowd noise in our favor, the championship\
  \ came down to the last play. Thorgreigir executed a move the team had worked on,\
  \ and went deep for an over-the-shoulder basket catch. One Hero Point later, we\
  \ stormed the field as only champions could.</p>\n      <p>□ You think you might\
  \ know what <em>Sky King’s Tomb</em> Adventure Path is like? Volume one delivered\
  \ the off-guard condition to our GM, and that’s hard to do. In total, we played\
  \ a bit over half of <em>Mantle of Gold, </em>which utilized FOUR different subsystems\
  \ from the <em>GM Core</em>: Reputation, Influence, Victory Points, and Infiltration.\
  \ One subsystem would have been interesting, two would have had us talking. With\
  \ four, author John Compton delivered something that changed the flow of our gameplay\
  \ in a way we’ve never experienced and are still processing—and we loved it.</p>\n\
  \      <p>□ There was a truly embarrassing scene that begs description. The forges\
  \ of the dwarven city were in dire need of assistance due to a recent labor strain.\
  \ We showed up in the hopes of earning reputation, but knew we were in trouble when\
  \ the ifrit dwarf in charge of “Burntown” asked to see our hands. She wanted smiths\
  \ and was sent a family of brewers. We failed check after check, with Torag himself\
  \ turning his head away from us. Drothgyr Firecask played music for inspiration,\
  \ but it only resulted in more beer breaks. The crossbow we repaired, well, it fired\
  \ two feet down and to the left. The shield we crafted, we felt bad even calling\
  \ it done. As for the fence we tried to build, we told ourselves it probably wasn’\
  t for actual use, right?</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"\

  \ 13px;\"></p>\n      </div>\n      <h2>The Scions</h2>\n      <p>Every family,\
  \ every clan, every gaming group that has lasted decades will have its own practices\
  \ and traditions passed down to its scions. Order of the Amber Die is here all these\
  \ years later because of what our members have passed down to each other since our\
  \ inception. The first member to show up with a legal notepad and special pen was\
  \ Andy; he referred to his session notes as a “log,” and while as kids we had no\
  \ idea what it was for, it changed our sessions forever. The log was overly detailed,\
  \ with exact damage numbers for every attack and spell. Still, we found ourselves\
  \ referring back to it between sessions to keep track of locations, items, or NPCs\
  \ we had met—the log helped us succeed. In future campaigns, someone would step\
  \ up to keep notes based on the tradition of Andy’s logs. The log changed forms\
  \ to suit the player keeping it; some preferred a scrapbook with pictures and quotes\
  \ from our sessions. While this might seem commonplace today, we didn’t know any\
  \ other groups in our junior high school that were keeping notes like we were back\
  \ in 1990. At least a half-dozen members have kept the log since, but the record\
  \ for the most detail sits with a scion who holds the torch that Andy once lit.\
  \ Karee Vogrin’s notes for this marathon sit at 9,101 words, are nearly twenty-five\
  \ pages, and will be posted to our Google Classroom where all players have access\
  \ to them.</p>\n      <h2><strong>Character Deaths:</strong></h2>\n      <p>□ None,\
  \ Folgrit watched over us.</p>\n      <h2><strong>Best Quote from Marathon 1:</strong></h2>\n\
  \      <p>(a marketing discussion stalls out around the table, ending in a squabble)</p>\n\
  \      <p>Renck Firecask: “I can see where the acumen comes from in this family.”\
  </p>\n      <p>Zuls Firecask: “It skips a generation.”</p>\n      <h2><strong>Current\
  \ Situation:</strong></h2>\n      <p>As the festival approaches, we succeeded in\
  \ growing the reputation of Clan Firecask, and then some! At the basilisk championship\
  \ we released our clan’s newest beer, Battle Axe, and became next year’s sponsor.\
  \ We earned the key to our very own tavern, even if it was overgrown with fungi.\
  \ We formed new friendships, one with a dwarf named Elbert Glassgrinder who cheered\
  \ us on and often bought us breakfast. One morning, Elbert told us his name is actually\
  \ Krohan, and confessed that he had both stolen AND lost the clan dagger of none\
  \ other than King Taargick, the Sky King. We spit out our beer—<em>come again</em>?\
  \ Lightly trusting Krohan for now, we are off to recover what he thinks is the lost\
  \ clan dagger…&nbsp;</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/815ffb6f-d444-4912-91a8-26ef588b7fc3/SkyScions_FungiShop3.jpg\"\
