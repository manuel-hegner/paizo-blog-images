  \ Play at PaizoCon 2018!</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Wednesday, April 18, 2018</p>\

  \ \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Convention planning involves lots of juggling,\
  \ starting with what scenarios to offer. As an organizer, you want to schedule games\
  \ players can participate in. The need for schedule juggling amplifies when we look\
  \ at the Paizo-sponsored conventions—PaizoCon, Origins, and Gen Con. For those,\
  \ we need several spotlight events, new scenarios, and a balance of the current\
  \ season's offerings. At one of the organized team meetings a few months back, we\
  \ decorated a white board with products releasing by August 2018 and started shuffling\
  \ things around.</p> \n    <p>One of our top considerations is what the season meta-plot\
  \ looks like and making sure we have coherent story paths. For Year of the Serpent,\
  \ we included all the meta-plot scenarios at both PaizoCon and Gen Con. For Year\
  \ of the Stolen Storm, we tried to make sure we had a variety of elemental scenarios\
  \ together so that con attendees could see each of the elemental planes. This year,\
  \ for Year of the Faction, there wasn't an overarching meta-plot outside of the\
  \ factions helping the Pathfinder Society, and there weren't multi-scenario arcs\
  \ in the vein of <a href=\"/products/btpy9ret?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-818-Champions-Chalice-Part-1-Blazing-Dangerous-Trails\"\
  ><em>#8-18: Champion's Chalice Part 1</em></a> and <a href=\"/products/btpy9s14?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-821-Champions-Chalice-Part-2-Agents-of-the-Eye\"\
  ><em>#8-21: Champion's Chalice Part 2</em></a>. So we looked at each factions' story\
  \ arc and tried scheduling them together.</p> \n    <p>For PaizoCon, we offered\
  \ the newest scenarios, including previews of <a href=\"/products/btpy9zk4?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-9-20-Fury-of-the-Final-Blade\"\
  ><em>#9-20: Fury of the Final Blade</em></a> and <a href=\"/products/btpy9zk5?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-9-21-In-the-Grandmaster-s-Name\"\
  ><em>#9-21: In the Grandmaster's Name</em></a>. I'm especially excited to see the\
  \ reaction to the latter, as Grandmaster Torch's name elicits such varied responses\
  \ from our playerbase. Plus, the premier of the third installment of our modular\
  \ special on Sunday night! 50 tables running the same event—<em>#8-99C: The Solstice\
  \ Scar—Version C</em>! Come see what has befallen Medda and crew in the past year!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Speaking of premiers—join GMs John Compton, Linda Zayas-Palmer, Lyz Liddell,\
  \ Leo Glass, and Chris Sims as they preview the first of the Pathfinder Society\
  \ Playtest Adventures—<em>#1 Rose Street Revenge</em>. These are lottery events\
  \ using pregenerated 1st level characters. Look for them in the catalog when it\
  \ goes live. A small teaser from the soon to be product page:</p> \n    <blockquote>\
  \ \n     <p>Less than a year has passed since the Fiendflesh Siege, in which Absalom\
  \ fended off an invading coalition of demonflesh constructs and the living dead.\
  \ The siege lord offered freedom to any slave in Absalom willing to aid in the city's\
  \ defense, and since that grand manumission, the city's slave trade has practically\
  \ disappeared. The Pathfinder Society is one of many organizations that opened its\
  \ doors to Absalom's newest citizens. However, several of the ex-slaves have been\
  \ turning up dead, in other cases disappearing entirely. The Society doesn't often\
  \ investigate serial killings, but one of its newest recruits is the latest victim.\
  \ It's time for a band of Pathfinders to follow the clues, uncover these crimes,\
  \ and end this threat.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>On the Starfinder side,\
  \ we have most of the recent catalog and previews of <a href=\"/products/btpy9zjx?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-1-14-Star-Sugar-Heartlove\"\
  ><em>#1-14: Star Sugar Heartlove!!!</em></a> and <a href=\"/products/btpy9zjy?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-1-15-Save-the-Renkrodas\"\
  ><em>Save the Renkrodas</em></a>. Who doesn't love some Strawberry Machine Cake?</p>\

  \ running in the ballroom, there are many other special events featuring the organized\
  \ play crew. There are panels on Starfinder Society, Pathfinder Society (with bonus\
  \ Pathfinder Society Playtest information) and Pathfinder Adventure Card Game. In\
  \ addition, the 10,000 Lakes Gaming Crew (those Minnesota people!) have sponsored\
  \ an afternoon's worth of games. If you wish to add a game to the schedule, <a href=\"\
  /paizocon/eventSubmission\">follow this link</a> for more information.</p> \n  \
  \  <p>Interested but haven't gotten your tickets? Here's a handy link to the <a\
  \ href=\"/paizocon\">main PaizoCon 2018 page</a> for all your ticketing and informational\
  \ needs.</p> \n    <h2>Volunteer Opportunities</h2> \n    <p>GMs should have received\
  \ their PaizoCon schedules last week. There are a few GMs that are \"waitlisted\"\
  \ pending schedule acceptance. We had more volunteers than scheduled games. This\
  \ is mixed result, as I hate to turn volunteers away, but I'm pleased we won't have\
  \ empty tables.</p> \n    <p>Gen Con is a different matter. <b>We still need volunteers!</b>\
  \ While we filled the demo team and XX, there is still room to run Pathfinder Society\
  \ Playtest Adventures, Starfinder Society fare, or Pathfinder Society Year of Factions'\
  \ Favor and the soon to be announced next season! Volunteers receive benefits based\
  \ on how many blocks they contribute. Rewards include 4-day badges, ¼ hotel rooms\
  \ in the downtown Westin, credit to paizo.com, a copy of a Paizo print product (choices\
  \ include <a href=\"/pathfinderplaytest\"><em>Pathfinder Playtest Standard Hardcover\
  \ Edition</em></a>, <a href=\"/products/btpy9x02?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Planar-Adventures\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder RPG Planar Adventures</em></a>, <a href=\"/products/btpy9xdl?Starfinder-Armory\"\
  ><em>Starfinder RPG Armory</em></a>, or a bundle of 3<a href=\"/pathfinder/cardgame/expansions\"\
  >Pathfinder Adventure Card Game Add-On Decks</a>. Interested? <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkem?A-Call-to-Vol-IIGen-Con-2018\"\
  >Check here for more information and to complete a volunteer questionnaire.</a></p>\
  \ \n    <p>So I thought there would be room to cover Origins' offerings as well\
  \ as PaizoCon, but looking at the length I think this blog is long enough. I'll\
  \ save the Origins' information for another blog.</p> \n    <p>Tune in next week\
  \ when we preview April's Starfinder Society and Pathfinder Society scenarios.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Until next time—Explore, Report, Cooperate!</p> \n    <p>Tonya Woldridge<br>\
