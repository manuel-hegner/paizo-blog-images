  Find the Path\"></a> \n     </div> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Paizo is pleased\
  \ to announce that Find the Path is now an officially licensed partner! They have\
  \ been producing a high-quality actual-play podcast of the Mummy's Mask Adventure\
  \ Path since May of 2018. Now, they are expanding to provide a podcast of the Tyrant's\
  \ Grasp Adventure Path, exclusively to subscribers via Patreon.</p> \n     <p>\"\
  Tyrant's Grasp is an important story connecting Pathfinder editions. It is a grand\
  \ finale for the first edition and sets the stage for the events to unfold in the\
  \ Age of Lost Omens. We are excited to have Find the Path bring it to life and make\
  \ it accessible to players both new and old,\" said Jim Butler, VP of Marketing\
  \ and Licensing.</p> \n     <p>Comprised of a group of longtime friends, Find the\
  \ Path produces content that invites gamers and non-gamers alike into the world\
  \ of Golarion during the Age of Lost Omens and the Pathfinder RPG. Known for their\
  \ strong grasp of the rules and cooperative table dynamics, Find the Path tells\
  \ engaging and exciting stories full of diverse, multifaceted characters and epic\
  \ fantasy adventure. Their deep understanding and respect for real-world history\
  \ and culture truly bring Golarion to life for listeners, and their ability to seamlessly\
  \ weave explanations of the rules into the story is an excellent way for those who\
  \ want to play Pathfinder. Along with high-quality audio and a respectful attitude\
  \ toward each other and listeners, Find the Path is building a vibrant, positive\
  \ community.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/091019_FindThePathCast.jpg\"\

  We've been playing Pathfinder Adventure Paths together for going on seven years,\
  \ so it's unbelievable to get to partner with Paizo. One of the important things\
  \ that Find the Path brings to the Pathfinder community is the idea that you don't\
  \ have to be a professional actor or comedian to have fun playing this game and\
  \ that there's a place at the table for everyone,\" said Jessica Peters, Partner\
  \ at Find the Path Ventures, LLC</p> \n     <h2>Mummy's Mask Adventure Path</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>The adventure begins in the Osirion city of Wati, where a lottery is\
  \ being held for intrepid explorers who want to investigate the Necropolis. A criminal-turned-monk,\
  \ a black marketeer, a priest of Horus, and a painter join together as the Doorkeepers\
  \ of the Duat to see what secrets the Half Dead City holds for them. Can the Doorkeepers\
  \ uncover the mysteries of the Necropolis and save not just Wati, but all of Osirion?\
  \ Listen to find out.</p> \n     <p>Mummy's Mask play episodes release weekly on\
  \ Tuesday morning. Mummy's Mask After Party episodes release on the Saturday morning\
  \ following every third play episode. </p> \n     <h2>Tyrant's Grasp Adventure Path</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>In this Patreon-exclusive podcast, the Find the Path crew plays through\
  \ Paizo's Tyrant's Grasp Adventure Path. Five normal, everyday people find themselves\
  \ pulled into an adventure where the fate of Ustalav, and perhaps the world, is\
  \ at stake. The adventure begins in the small town of Roslar's Coffer where a woodworker,\
  \ a barmaid, a rancher, and a cemetery caretaker are preparing for the yearly Remembrance\
  \ Moon festival celebrating those who gave their lives defending Lastwall. Just\
  \ as the festival begins, our four heroes see a flash of light and awaken entombed\
  \ in a crypt. Now they must figure out a way to get home before all is lost!</p>\
