  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">After over a year and a\
  \ half of hard work, today is when we at Roll For Combat launch our <a href=\"http://kickstarter.rollforcombat.com/\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Kickstarter for the RPG Superstar <em>Battlezoo Bestiary</em></a>,\
  \ the culmination of the RPG Superstar contest from last year finally assembled\
  \ in hardcover book format. However, we didn’t stop there! Not only are we launching\
  \ the Bestiary, but we’re also launching the new Monster Parts System, the <em>Battlezoo\
  \ Ancestries: Dragons</em> hardcover book, and the new level 1-10 Jewel of the Indigo\
  \ Isles Adventure Path, all for Pathfinder Second Edition!</p> \n     <p>However,\
  \ rather than discuss these new books myself, I thought the authors of these projects\
  \ should speak for themselves.</p> \n     <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight:\

  \     </center> \n     <p><b>Mark Seifter, Author of the Monster Parts System &amp;\
  \ Battlezoo Ancestries: Dragons</b></p> \n     <p>Hi everyone, Mark Seifter here,\
  \ talking to you today, not in my role at Paizo, but as the author of a brand new\
  \ system for treasure you’ll find in the upcoming <em>Battlezoo Bestiary</em>, which\
  \ you can get at <a href=\"http://kickstarter.rollforcombat.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\
  >http://kickstarter.rollforcombat.com/</a>. With monster part crafting, you can\
  \ replace or enhance the default treasure distribution system for Pathfinder with\
  \ an all-new take that allows you to upgrade your items with monster parts from\
  \ the creatures you defeat so that they level up along with your character and gain\
  \ new powers. </p> \n     <p>Whether you want to use the new system exclusively,\
  \ just a little, or somewhere in between, I built out three different variations\
  \ so you can choose the one that’s right for your group—and I did all the math,\
  \ so you don’t have to! I generated new tables that let the GM know how to hand\
  \ out monster parts in a way that allows plenty of cool upgrades but is also fully\
  \ balanced with Pathfinder under the normal rules. I also included sidebars if you\
  \ want to combine the system with other variant rules that alter treasure, like\
  \ relics and automatic bonus progression. For a sneak peek, check out this quick\
  \ start guide for players, taken from the book itself:</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  \ 13px;\"></p>\n     </div> \n     <br> \n     <p>As if that’s not cool enough,\
  \ there are also a few neat rules options for characters who use monster parts to\
  \ power their abilities, which you can use in your game whether or not you’re using\
  \ the monster part system. The big ones are the monster mage archetype, which lets\
  \ you learn and cast spells from defeated monsters, and the vestige hunter archetype,\
  \ which enables you to take feats to gain special abilities used by the monsters\
  \ you’ve defeated. The vestige hunter can incorporate the defeated monster’s vestige\
  \ into their equipment or into their own body. For instance, if you took the feat\
  \ to gain a breath weapon from a defeated monster, you could bathe in the dragon’\
  s blood to gain a breath weapon or build a dragon head onto your shield so that\
  \ it can unleash a breath weapon... and that’s not a random example! You can actually\
  \ see the iconic monster mage in her blue robes and the iconic vestige hunter with\
  \ his dragon head shield on the cover of <em>Battlezoo Bestiary</em>!</p> <a href=\"\

  \   <p>I’m also writing <em>Battlezoo Ancestries: Dragons</em>, which will allow\
  \ you to play dragons as PCs. I know allowing dragon PCs in the game sounds like\
  \ it could be overpowered, but I’ve carefully balanced them with other options using\
  \ archetypes to allow you to spend both class feats and ancestry feats to unlock\
  \ additional draconic abilities. I’m so sure that the dragons won’t be disruptive\
  \ that if that isn’t the case, you can contact me on my Arcane Mark Twitch channel\
  \ or Discord, and we’ll figure out how to make it work. Players, you can tell your\
  \ GMs that too if they’re uncertain! So come along with me on this journey as I\
  \ pursue my passion project to bring the dragon ancestry to life and explore the\
  \ myriad possibilities with 40 different dragon heritages based on the 39 true dragons\
  \ of Pathfinder and one brand new dragon native to the Indigo Isles!</p> \n    \

  \ \n     <p>One of my favorite movies growing up was <em>Hook</em>, Steven Spielberg’\
  s wonderful rendition of the story of Peter Pan. The movie seemed readymade for\
  \ nostalgia tripping—nearly every millennial of a certain age can vividly recall\
  \ the scene in which Peter must use his imagination to conjure the neon-colored\
  \ “neverfood” at the Lost Boys’ banquet dinner. Rewatching <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPCzjHPS--U\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">the scene</a>, I was pleased with how accurately I’d remembered\
  \ the radioactive hues of the fantastical goop, which the boys raucously fling at\
  \ one another in a food fight for the ages.</p> \n     <p>The g’mayun, Jeffrey Anderson’\
  s prize-winning entry to the 2020 RPG Superstar competition, evoked the same feelings\
  \ of boisterous bonhomie and motley mayhem I experienced while watching <em>Hook</em>\
  \ all those years ago. Like the Lost Boys, g’mayuns are merrymaking pirates of a\
  \ benign yet bacchanalian bent, unwilling to “grow up” or submit to the rigid rules\
  \ of other societies. The cultural legacy of g’mayuns—a history of demonic corruption\
  \ and divine redemption—is both tragic and triumphant, similar to the bittersweet\
  \ story of the grown-up Peter Pan. Yet, their parrot-like bodies, rainbow-hued irises,\
  \ and carefree way of life are as delightful as Spielberg’s technicolor neverfood\
  \ and the Lost Boys’ jubilation.</p> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/bafe2c2a-76da-490e-af2a-6ee451dfdcae/083121_02.Gmayun.png\"\

  \ <p>After developing the g’mayun for Roll For Combat’s <em>Battlezoo Bestiary</em>,\
  \ I could hardly resist devising a Pathfinder campaign populated with these beautiful\
  \ bird-folk. Brainstorming the series’ story and setting with Stephen, Linda, and\
  \ Ron, I had as much fun as a kid at a food fight. The result, the Jewel of the\
  \ Indigo Isles Adventure Path, is everything a Hook-loving mischief-maker could\
  \ ask for: a thrilling journey of grand adventure, high-stakes challenges, and bountiful\
  \ buried treasures. The characters start their adventure with a seemingly simple\
  \ goal—find the missing fortune of the famous pirate Poppy von Barnacle—but they\
  \ soon find themselves at the center of an epic swashbuckling tale spanning the\
  \ tropical Indigo Isles. All the while, the party will meet countless monstrous\
  \ foes and unusual friends, each drawn from the 100+ new monsters in the Battlezoo\
  \ Bestiary, along with a horde of new creatures we’ve written specifically for this\
  \ campaign.</p> \n     <p>Jewel of the Indigo Isles is the kind of fun, colorful\
  \ story that makes me feel like a kid again, and I can’t wait to share it with you.\
  \ I hope you find this series as rejuvenating as I do and that, above all, it ignites\
  \ your imagination.</p> \n     <p><b>Ron Lundeen, author of book #2, Voyage to Runaway\
  \ Reef (for levels 4-6)</b></p> \n     <p>Greetings! I’m Ron Lundeen, and I have\
  \ the pleasure of writing the second adventure in this campaign, “Voyage to Runaway\
  \ Reef.” I love having an adventure that calls back to the classic stories of sailing\
  \ through dangerous waters in search of a greater prize, like Homer’s Odyssey and\
  \ the adventures of Sinbad the Sailor. I’m old enough to have run the D&amp;D adventure\
  \ <em>M1: Into the Maelstrom</em>, which was, I later realized, mostly a fantasy\
  \ reworking of the <em>Odyssey</em>. </p> \n     <p>In these classic tales, the\
  \ excitement is in the fanciful places the heroes visit, and “Voyage to Runaway\
  \ Reef” is no different. The heroes visit Bluebell Island, which contains the town\
  \ of Seaview and the lively orpoks, a new ancestry that I know people are going\
  \ to love. The heroes must also visit other islands, including the ominous Moonshadow\
  \ Island and, of course, Runaway Reef, populated by another new ancestry, the chochori.\
  \ The adventure contains a lot of island-hopping fun, but I get to provide even\
  \ more of it in the volume’s gazetteer showcasing the Indigo Isles. Time to set\
  \ sail for adventure!</p> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/75264d6e-a610-46ea-a87c-24ca5cb776db/083121_Orpok_FINAL.png\"\

  \ #3, Battle at Barnacle Bay (for levels 7-10)</b></p> \n     <p>I’m excited to\
  \ be working on the third volume of the Jewel of the Indigo Isles Adventure Path.\
  \ Without getting into spoiler territory, I can say that this part will be full\
  \ of cinematic adventure and opportunities for your motley band of characters to\
  \ show off just how strong they’ve become. My experience as a GM and author up to\
  \ this point has mostly been in the world of Golarion, so it’s fun to be part of\
  \ building a setting from the ground up. In this new world of Alacar, all gods are\
  \ part of a paradigm known as the Balance.</p> \n     <p>Through the Balance, gods\
  \ exist in groups, usually pairs, representing connected concepts such as Life and\
  \ Death or Fire and Water. Though these gods of opposing forces may come into conflict,\
  \ they must also ensure that their counterparts’ strength does not dwindle too much.\
  \ Whenever a god dies, their partner in the Balance dies as well. Among mortals,\
  \ the Balance is more than just a matter of discussion for theological scholars;\
  \ the ideology also helps define how people interact with the divine. For just as\
  \ the god of Water could not extinguish the god of Fire, so too do the followers\
  \ of the god of Water know that nothing good can come of attempts to quench the\
  \ god of Fire’s influence.</p> \n     <br clear=\"all\"> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
