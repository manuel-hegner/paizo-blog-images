  \ \n   <p>by Andrew Penn Romine</p> \n   <h2>Chapter Three: Buried in the Sky</h2>\
  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">Captain\
  \ Najh Semekh and his two soldiers formed a wall between Shaba Alemas and me. Drawn\
  \ scimitars gleamed cold with starlight, while Najh's knife dripped rancid black\
  \ fluid. I drew my own dagger, trying to catch Shaba's eyes, but they were hidden\
  \ in pools of shadow. The sleeping roc stirred, the sound of its feathers ruffling\
  \ like the canvas of a ship under sail.</span></p> \n    <p>Shaba raised a hand.\
  \ At first I thought it in supplication to the assassin, but the words that tumbled\
  \ from her mouth were more like a prayer. A calloused finger flew to her lips, shushing\
  \ Najh, and suddenly all sound died away. </p> \n    <p>A wise precaution, as waking\
  \ the roc would likely doom us all. Still, the magical silence did nothing to hinder\
  \ the satrap's assassins, while simultaneously preventing me from using my own magic\
  \ to salvage the situation. The soldiers advanced, their booted feet silent across\
  \ the sand-blown floor.</p> \n    <p>Fortunately, in addition to magic, I had learned\
  \ a different sort of craft at Aunt Jaffira's knee—the geometries of knife work\
  \ and the weak places where a halfling's blade might bite deepest. Najh's brows\
  \ lifted in surprise as I stepped forward. Perhaps he had not expected me to fight.\
  \ A mere astrologer does not pose much of a threat to a trained soldier, even if\
  \ that astrologer is a convicted thief.</p> \n    <p>A thief with a destiny. </p>\
  \ \n    <p>I plunged my knife into the back of a soldier's knee, feeling the leather\
  \ of his high boot pop like a split sausage casing. His legs buckled, and he fell\
  \ hard to the floor, his mouth open in a ragged, soundless scream. I rewarded him\
  \ with my fiercest grin, one I was sure that Aunt Jaffira would approve of, then\
  \ acquainted his face with the sole of my boot. I imagined a satisfying crunch to\
  \ accompany the spray of blood from his nose. The man sprawled senselessly upon\
  \ the landing of the precarious stair. </p> \n    <p>Shaba, her blade still in its\
  \ scabbard, evaded her assailant's slash and kicked hard at his ankle. He fell sideways,\
  \ colliding with his comrade on the stairs, mute profanities reddening his face.\
  \ Najh leapt clear of the fray, scimitar in one hand, poisoned knife in the other.\
  \ His handsome face was pinched with doubt. </p> \n    <p>So much for the would-be\
  \ assassins of the Pierced Rose. </p> \n    <p>One of the fallen soldiers fought\
  \ to rise from the tangle of limbs and stumbled—or so I first thought. Only when\
  \ several stones fell away from the edge of the landing did I realize the truth.\
  \ The fragile stair was giving way. The fellow made a fruitless attempt to leap\
  \ over the buckling stonework to the relative safety of the nest, but his efforts\
  \ only hastened the disintegration of the stair. He and his companion vanished into\
  \ the gloom below. They fell in eerie silence, and not a stone thundered or echoed\
  \ at the bottom. </p> \n    <p>Najh retreated, putting his back to the wall and\
  \ the gap in the floor to his right. He choked on a lungful of dust rising from\
  \ the subsidence below. I turned my knife toward him. Once more, the phantom sound\
  \ of sails rippled in my ears. </p> \n    <p>\"Oh dear,\" I whispered, glancing\
  \ to my left. Shaba's spell had fallen along with the soldiers. </p> \n    <p>Distracted\
  \ as I was, Najh readied himself for a thrust, but a sudden resonant wind arose.\
  \ The steady drawing of air prickled the hairs of my neck. A flicker of motion danced\
  \ in Najh's wide stare, his eyes reflecting the danger like mirrors. </p> \n   \
  \ <p>\"Raaaarrrrrrrrrrwwwkkkkkkk!\"</p> \n    <p>Forgetting Najh, I turned to face\
  \ the peril rising behind me. A pair of hungry white moons rose into view. An enormous\
  \ beak flashed like hammered brass, and at its center a pale, fleshy tongue dripped\
  \ with slime. The roc stood, buffeting us with grit and a stench like a camel pit\
  \ in the heat of summer. </p> \n    <p>To his credit, the assassin was only momentarily\
  \ deterred. He swept his blade at my head, and when I jumped aside, he surged forward\
  \ to face Shaba. She had still not drawn her sword. </p> \n    <p>\"Your pacifist\
  \ dreams end tonight, Shaba Alemas. There will be no more resistance within Sarenrae's\
  \ church. Qadira's glory will be her own.\" </p> \n    <p>Shaba unbelted her sword,\
  \ though she still refused to draw it from its scabbard. </p> \n    <p>\"That is\
  \ for Sarenrae to determine,\" she said. </p> \n    <p>\"How about you and the halfling\
  \ ask her yourself?\" </p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Najh.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> Najh makes a much better assassin than he does an expedition leader.\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>\"If it's all the same to both of you, I'd rather live!\" I\
  \ shouted.</p> \n    <p>The roc screamed its disagreement. </p> \n    <p>The great\
  \ bird lunged forward, shredding stone with its black talons. The whole of the tower\
  \ swayed, rolling the eggs, the Eye, and what was left of our expedition decidedly\
  \ toward the shattered rim of the parapet. The roc took momentarily to the air,\
  \ confused in its blindness. The Eye of Azzah broke free of the clutch of eggs and\
  \ accelerated toward the edge of the tower. The heat of its passing pressed me back,\
  \ but Shaba cried out and threw herself in front of the globe to try and halt its\
  \ precarious slide. </p> \n    <p>Najh advanced with a triumphant smile and drove\
  \ his blades at the distracted hermit. </p> \n    <p>\"Burn,\" I commanded, spraying\
  \ flames at the pouncing assassin. Caught within the roiling blast, Najh howled\
  \ and dropped his sword. His charred fist retained its hold on his dagger, however,\
  \ and he turned the fury of his glare upon me. </p> \n    <p>\"You'll regret that,\
  \ you little cur!\" </p> \n    <p>I ran, but the shaking tower caused me to veer\
  \ closer to the panicking roc. The beast's cries pierced my eardrums nearly as effectively\
  \ as Shaba's mantra of silence. It grabbed blindly at the nest, trying to save the\
  \ eggs but only making matters worse. The floor trembled and stones dropped away\
  \ from the edge of the tower, clattering down the sides as they fell. The giant\
  \ bird's cries grew shriller as the nest fell apart and the eggs rolled freely.\
  \ I narrowly avoided a downward-flashing beak, Najh dogging my heels.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>I looked up to see the blind eyes of the roc shining in the starlight. Perhaps\
  \ it dimly recognized the tasty morsel running directly beneath it. The threads\
  \ of its fate had nearly unraveled—the beast was old, blind, and sick. The desert\
  \ air that eddied and pooled at the tips of its feathers sang to me. It could barely\
  \ stay aloft. </p> \n    <p>Najh's blade swished in the air behind me, trying to\
  \ sever the threads of my own destiny. </p> \n    <p>I risked a glance over my shoulder\
  \ at Shaba. She had managed to halt the Eye from its plunge, her arms wrapped around\
  \ it. Her face was contorted in a rictus of pain. The heat must have been incredible,\
  \ and I marveled that the hermit could maintain such a grip. The stench of cooking\
  \ flesh filled the air, and I knew Shaba wouldn't be able to hold it much longer.\
  \ </p> \n    <p>Then I ran straight into a wall of reeking feathers, and had no\
  \ further time to contemplate Shaba's predicament. Filthy barbs snatched at my hair\
  \ and plucked at my beard, entangling me in the bird's plumage. Najh had me at his\
  \ mercy.</p> \n    <p>Yet fate was not so kind to Najh Semekh. With a groan like\
  \ the earth itself splitting apart, Shaba rose to her feet, hefting the Eye of Azzah\
  \ in her blistering hands. With a last, worshipful glance at the writing upon the\
  \ stone, she hurled it at Najh. </p> \n    <p>What it must have cost her to give\
  \ up that stone! And she did it for me.</p> \n    <p>The stone struck Najh across\
  \ the kidneys, sending him staggering backward. </p> \n    <p>Right into the blind\
  \ pecking of the roc. </p> \n    <p>Whatever the roc could see, it sensed that at\
  \ least one violator of its nest was within striking distance, and the great bronze\
  \ curve of its beak lunged down and plucked the would-be assassin from the floor.\
  \ The attack dislodged me from the vile black feathers, and I tumbled to the ground.\
  \ </p> \n    <p>To his credit, Najh made a valiant fight of it. Despite the razor-keen\
  \ grip of the beak slicing into his torso, he still struggled, managing to puncture\
  \ one milky eye with his poisoned blade. The roc lifted fully into the sky, blanketing\
  \ the tower in a black snow of feathers. With one talon like a cage of wrought iron,\
  \ it tore the assassin from its beak.</p> \n    <p>Well, most of him anyway. Much\
  \ of the rest vanished into the roc's pink gullet or fell as crimson rain upon me.\
  \ </p> \n    <p>But the roc was gravely injured by Najh's final blow. It wheeled\
  \ in a frenzied spiral, pulverizing stones and smashing sun-rotted timbers. I struggled\
  \ to rise in the heaving chaos. I cried out to Shaba to come nearer, but even as\
  \ the words formed on my lips, the top of the tower gave way with a roar that drowned\
  \ out even the roc's dying screech. The surge of rubble carried us all—Shaba, myself,\
  \ the Eye of Azzah, and the roc itself—out into the nocturnal abyss of the Ketz\
  \ sky. </p> \n    <p>A miasma of stinging dust enfolded me, choking out sight and\
  \ sound and air. But I had already prepared my call to the desert winds, and they\
  \ congealed beneath me in a pillar like the very breath of the dunes. I righted\
  \ myself in the column of air and searched the roiling clouds for the hermit.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>A fold of homespun wool, fluttering within the billowing dust, caught\
  \ my eye. A ribbon of her long black hair caught the delicate glint of starlight,\
  \ and in that brief flash I knew that she had never been destined to be buried in\
  \ the sky like her revered Azzah. Greater things lay in store. </p> \n    <p>At\
  \ my command, the desert winds shifted again, and a finger of air unwound from the\
  \ body of my rescuing pillar, stretching out to catch her and slow her fall. </p>\
  \ \n    <p>The rest of the debris crashed into the desert in a clangorous rumble,\
  \ burying both the roc and the Eye of Azzah. We touched down atop the rubble several\
  \ moments later, raising only the barest cloud of dust. </p> \n    <p>Shaba grimaced\
  \ when she saw the ruin. </p> \n    <p>\"The satrap nearly had his wish, halfling.\
  \ You were right.\" She spat a muddy gob of dust. </p> \n    <p>\"It pains me to\
  \ be so.\" </p> \n    <p>Shaba crouched for long minutes without reply, sifting\
  \ through the debris. Her hands were blistered from the Eye's touch, and I wondered\
  \ how she could stand to move them at all. After some few minutes I grew impatient\
  \ to return to the tower and see if any of the treasures in the interior remained\
  \ unburied, yet I forced myself to wait. At last, she pulled a fist-sized chunk\
  \ of heatstone from the pile. Only fragments of Azzah's final words remained. Shaba's\
  \ expression was as shattered as the Eye. </p> \n    <p>\"The Eye is destroyed,\"\
  \ I said.</p> \n    <p>\"But you're safe,\" she replied. I couldn't tell if it was\
  \ a curse. </p> \n    <p>There was a long pause. Then at last I asked the question\
  \ that hung over us. \"Why did you save me, Shaba? It cost you the stone, yet you\
  \ didn't hesitate.\"</p> \n    <p>A rare smile bloomed on her face. It was the crooked\
  \ grin of someone unused to such expressions of mirth, but I decided I liked it\
  \ when Shaba smiled. </p> \n    <p>\"Perhaps it was your destiny, Kazzar.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>I returned her smile and plucked a large black feather from between two\
  \ stones. Such a treasure, even with its barbs kinked from the fall, would make\
  \ a mighty pen, or perhaps adorn a fine new turban.</p> \n    <p>\"We could piece\
  \ the stone back together,\" I suggested. </p> \n    <p> \"But it would take many\
  \ days to gather all the fragments, while the satrap yet plots.\" She tumbled the\
  \ fragment of the Eye in her hands. \"I had hoped Azzah's stone would unify our\
  \ temple, but perhaps my own words will have to serve for now.\" </p> \n    <p>\"\
  We can't go back to Katheer,\" I said. \"At least not yet.\" </p> \n    <p>Shaba\
  \ had climbed down from the rubble to the rocky sand. The sky brightened almost\
  \ imperceptibly. Sarenrae's glory would rise above the horizon soon. Her hermit-priest\
  \ raised an eyebrow at me. </p> \n    <p>\"No, it's the best time to return. It\
  \ will unbalance the conspirators. Force the satrap and his allies among the high\
  \ priests to acknowledge me. I will not be intimidated. How about you, Haron esh\
  \ Kazzar?\" </p> \n    <p>I decided, just for that moment, to let Sarenrae's star\
  \ guide my fate, and followed the priest back to where the camels waited.</p> \n\
