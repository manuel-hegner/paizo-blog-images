  \ \n     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Greetings, Starfinders!\
  \ Earlier this year we announced that Fame would be going away, and this naturally\
  \ prompted a number of questions. We’ve combed through the ensuing discussions and\
  \ we’re here today to present answers! Many of these will be added to the Starfinder\
  \ Society FAQ pages or other locations as appropriate, but I wanted to consolidate\
  \ them all in one place as a reference.</p> \n      <h3>Conversion of Fame to AcP</h3>\
  \ \n      <p>Let’s start with the big one. When we announced this transition, we\
  \ promised we’d get a way to convert your unspent fame to Achievement Points.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>We’re not doing that.</p> \n      <p>Instead, we are outright stealing\
  \ adopting what I refer to as “The HMM Proposal.” <b>Every Starfinder session played\
  \ prior to May 31, 2021 will retroactively award 2 Achievement Points to both players\
  \ and GMs.</b> This is the simplest way to handle this, as well as the fairest.\
  \ It prevents headaches, having to dig out old Chronicle Sheets, and look, it’s\
  \ just a really clean system, why mess with a great idea?</p> \n      <p>Yes, it\
  \ technically rewards the players who spent all their Fame, but those players are\
  \ also our most invested players. Personally, I’m cool with them getting a little\
  \ extra.</p> \n      <p>These points should be awarded no later than <b>next Friday,\
  \ the 12th</b>. If you notice old SFS sessions that aren’t awarding Achievement\
  \ Points after that, please email orgplayreportingerrors@paizo.com and I’ll take\
  \ a look!</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/3248759d-7414-446b-b50b-bd2c7f7bdc33/031121_TrainBattle.jpg\"\

  \ style=\"font-size: 13px;\"></p>\n      </div> \n      <br> \n      <h2>Other General\
  \ Questions</h2> \n      <h3>Changing Quest Pack Reporting</h3> \n      <p>One weird\
  \ wrinkle we came across was because quest packs can be completed across multiple\
  \ sessions, a player could end up with more Achievement Points than anticipated.\
  \ As a result, I’m going to add some extra reporting options for Starfinder Quests.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>If you complete all four parts of a quest pack in one session, reporting\
  \ won’t change for that. However, if you only complete some of the quests, you will\
  \ now be able to report each segment individually and it will award the correct\
  \ amount of Achievement Points. Again, this will be in place by next Friday; there’\
  s no need to retroactively correct old sessions, but if you see any issues, email\
  \ orgplayreportingerrors@paizo.com!</p> \n      <h3>Unapplied Fame</h3> \n     \
  \ <p>Any Fame that has been earned but not yet applied (e.g., from an Adventure\
  \ or playing a pregen at a higher level) must be applied and spent by December 31.\
  \ As Fame cannot be spent after that date, any unapplied and unspent Fame will be\
  \ lost.</p> \n      <br> \n      <h2>Boon-Specific Questions</h2> \n      <p>In\
  \ addition to general questions, there were a few questions that came up about specific\
  \ boons that required Fame to function. Be aware there are some scenario spoilers\
  \ in this section!</p> \n      <h3>Inequity in Faction Boons</h3> \n      <p>Currently,\
  \ some Factions have more boons available for purchase in the online boon store\
  \ than others; in particular, the Second Seeker factions are a little light. It\
  \ is our intention to fill in the gaps in the matrix as the developers have time\
  \ to create new boons.</p> \n      <h3>Starfinder of Note</h3> \n      <p>The Starfinder\
  \ of Note boon has not yet been added to the Achievement Points system. At this\
  \ time, we will not be adding the boon back, simply because we do not currently\
  \ have any definite plans to use the submissions in future products. If and when\
  \ we decide to bring back fan submissions (e.g., if we need a new First Seeker or\
  \ similar), we’ll look at bringing back the boon. Any past submissions are still\
  \ on file, and should the boon make a return, those submissions will also be considered.</p>\
  \ \n      <h3>Instructor Boon (Luwazi Elsebo/Ehu Hadif)</h3> \n      <p>The current\
  \ text of the Instructor boon for Ehu Hadif in the Achievement Points system is\
  \ as follows:</p> \n      <blockquote> \n       <p style=\"font-family:'Courier\
  \ New'\">You dedicate some of your time off to training an up-and-coming Starfinder\
  \ recruit. This boon represents time spent outside of adventuring that you’re taking\
  \ to train a potential new Starfinder. At the end of every adventure you have this\
  \ boon slotted, record the total amount of Reputation you earned with the Second\
  \ Seekers (Ehu Hadif). You can expend your Downtime at the end of an adventure to\
  \ increase the boxes marked off for this boon by 1. Once you have accrued 40 marked\
  \ boxes with this boon, your student has come into their own and is ready to become\
  \ a full-fledged Starfinder (a new character). Have your GM mark the Chronicle Sheet\
  \ where you accomplished this, and keep a copy of this boon with your new character.\
  \ When your new character reaches 5th level, instead of choosing four ability scores\
  \ to increase, you can choose five. Otherwise you follow all other rules for leveling\
  \ up. This bonus applies only at 5th level.</p> \n       <p style=\"font-family:'Courier\
  \ New'\">Special: You can apply this boon only to one new character, and only once\
  \ the objectives have been completed.</p> \n      </blockquote> \n      <p>The same\
  \ text should be used for the Luwazi Elsebo iteration going forward.</p> \n    \
  \  <h3>Lone Agent</h3> \n      <p>The Lone Agent boon was a convention reward that\
  \ allowed you to convert Reputation earned into an immediate discount on a Fame\
  \ boon purchase. After December 31, 2021, <b>this boon will no longer function</b>.\
  \ We tried to keep the list of boons that outright would not work small, and in\
  \ this case converting it would require a full rewrite. Our apologies to Lone Agent\
  \ fans.</p> \n      <h3>SFS 1-01: The Commencement</h3> \n      <p>Change the text\
  \ of the Faction’s Friend boon to the following:</p> \n      <blockquote> \n   \
  \    <p style=\"font-family:'Courier New'\">By assisting various factions of the\
  \ Starfinder Society, you have proven yourself as a dependable asset. By slotting\
  \ this boon, if you would fail to earn Reputation at the end of an adventure by\
  \ failing to fulfill a success condition, you can check one of the boxes on this\
  \ boon. Doing so reminds your current championed faction of your past exploits,\
  \ and you still earn 1 Reputation with that faction as if you had successfully fulfilled\
  \ the condition. You can use this boon only if you would also gain at least 1 XP\
  \ for completing the adventure.</p> \n      </blockquote> \n      <h3>SFS 1-14:\
  \ Star Sugar Heartlove!</h3> \n      <p>Change the Scoured Stars Memorial boon’\
  s text to the following:</p> \n      <blockquote> \n       <p style=\"font-family:'Courier\
  \ New'\">Thanks to your efforts on Songbird Station, the Starfinder Society earned\
  \ immense publicity from the Strawberry Machine Cake concert. Organizations and\
  \ people across the Pact Worlds now go out of their way to assist the Starfinder\
  \ Society. You can check the box next to this boon to do one of the following:</p>\
  \ \n       <ul> \n        <li style=\"font-family:'Courier New'\">Ignore the Achievement\
  \ Point cost of having your body recovered.</li> \n        <li style=\"font-family:'Courier\
  \ New'\">Ignore the Achievement Point cost of purchasing the Starship Towing boon.</li>\
  \ \n       </ul> \n       <p style=\"font-family:'Courier New'\">Checking this box\
  \ does not require purchase of the relevant boon via the Achievement Points system.</p>\
  \ \n      </blockquote> \n      <h3>SFS 1-38: The Many Minds of Historia</h3> \n\
  \      <p>The Steadfast Protector boon will be added to the Chronicle Boons section\
  \ of the online boon store. It will require completion of SFS 1-38, as well as Tier\
  \ 3 Reputation (25+ Reputation) with the Exo-Guardians and will cost 8 Achievement\
  \ Points. The version listed on this Chronicle Sheet will cease to be purchasable\
  \ as of December 31, 2021, though its benefits may still be used by characters that\
  \ have already spent the required Fame.</p> \n      <h3>SFS 2-16: A Scoured Home</h3>\
  \ \n      <p>Change the last sentence of the Nuclear Tools boon to the following:</p>\
  \ \n      <blockquote> \n       <p style=\"font-family:'Courier New'\">If you are\
  \ not an izalguun, you may perform the same upgrade by spending an additional 10%\
  \ of the cost of the upgrade (1,650 UPBs) to work with an izalguun Starfinder.</p>\
  \ \n      </blockquote> \n      <p>We hope this answers all the outstanding questions\
  \ about the transition away from Fame for Starfinder Society! If you have any questions\
  \ about these changes or any other topics we missed, please let us know in the comments.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Until next time - Explore! Report! Cooperate! And go spend your new\
  \ Achievement Points!</p> \n      <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold;\
