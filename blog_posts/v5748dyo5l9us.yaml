  \ \n   <blockquote> \n    <h1><br>The Fabled Appendix - Erik Mona (Part 2)</h1>\
  \ \n    <p class=\"date\">Wednesday, February 18, 2009</p> \n    <p>This is the\
  \ second part of my interview with Erik Mona about the sources of inspiration he\
  \ would list if Paizo created its own \"Appendix N.\" In today's blog, Erik discusses\
  \ the books and ideas that inspired his creation of Osirion and Cheliax, two of\
  \ the best-known regions of the Pathfinder Chronicles campaign setting.</p> \n \
  \   <blockquote> \n     <p><b>David</b>: What historical, mythological, or fictional\
  \ sources did you use to develop Osirion? I know you mentioned <i>The Sirius Mystery</i>\
  \ on the message boards. Any other sources like this?</p> \n     <p><b>Erik</b>:\
  \ I've always been interested in Ancient Egypt. In terms of books, one of my favorites\
  \ was a collection of illustrations made by the surveyors who traveled with Napoleon's\
  \ army throughout Egypt. Napoleon's scientific surveys of Egypt were a major inspiration\
  \ for the whole concept of the Pathfinder Society—a group of explorers and treasure\
  \ seekers whose level of altruism can vary greatly.</p> \n     <p>Another source\
  \ of inspiration was the book you mentioned, Robert Temple's <i>The Sirius Mystery</i>.\
  \ Temple introduces the concept that alien astronauts, aquatic beings from a planet\
  \ orbiting the Dog Star, came down and gave culture to the Ancient Egyptians. After\
  \ reading this, I immediately had visions of aqueducts, waterways, and pools surrounding\
  \ Egypt, with aboleths swimming in their depths, commanding the people to construct\
  \ enormous monuments. In fact, the name \"Osirion\" comes from this mixture of Egyptian\
  \ culture and alien influences, as it plays off of the names Sirius and Osiris.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>David</b>: What's the story behind Cheliax? When did you come up\
  \ with the idea of having a nation of devil-worshippers? What were your primary\
  \ sources of inspiration?</p> \n     <p><b>Erik</b>: I grew up in Minnesota, and\
  \ while I was visiting the state capital I saw an image that became indelibly burned\
  \ into my brain, of a Christian monk preaching to a group of American Indians. Since\
  \ then, the idea of religious colonization has always been in the back of my mind.\
  \ A while ago, I designed a miniatures-based game just for fun. I wanted the game\
  \ to have a lot of inherent conflict, so I came up with the idea of a fantasy society\
  \ that discovers gateways to another world rich in resources. I wanted to make the\
  \ game about colonization and the conflicts that arise from that, so I decided that\
  \ I needed several factions that had antipathy for each other. For one of the factions,\
  \ I went back to that image for the missionary—except instead of the Christian cross,\
  \ I made their icon a pentagram. This took the theme I was aiming for—religious\
  \ colonization—and made it undeniably, inherently evil.</p> \n     <p>For the faction's\
  \ title, I used the name of an evil empire I had created for a piece of sword and\
  \ sorcery fiction that I wrote in college. At the time, I had named this empire\
  \ Chelan because of a horrible family vacation that we had at Lake Chelan in Washington\
  \ State. After I moved to Washington, I wanted to change the name, but at the same\
  \ time to make it sound more evil. Cheliax, in Golarion, originally started out\
  \ in my mind as a colonial power—Arcadia being the stand-in for the unexplored continent\
  \ that was in my miniatures game.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Thus ends the\
  \ second part of my interview with Erik about his sources of inspiration. In the\
  \ conclusion, Erik reveals how his miniatures game gave birth to several other Golarion\
  \ nations and explains how <i>Thundarr the Barbarian</i> fits into the whole picture.\
  \ Sources of inspiration abound!</p> \n    <p>David Eitelbach<br> Editorial Intern</p>\
