  >We're about two weeks from the official release date of the <a href=\"/products/btpy91pu\"\
  >Wrath of the Righteous</a> set of <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids\"\
  >Pathfinder Battles</a> prepainted plastic figures, which means our previews for\
  \ this set will soon come to an end. This week we focus on the final six figures\
  \ in the 55-mini set, leaving next week for a final, triumphant look at the demon\
  \ lord Deskari, the case-incentive limited edition promotional figure for this set.</span></p>\
  \ \n     <p>Following that, we'll begin to clear away the snow covering our NEXT\
  \ set, <a href=\"/products/btpy92s9\">Reign of Winter</a>, but let's not get too\
  \ far ahead of ourselves for today. Instead, let's take one last look at some of\
  \ the evil creatures and antagonists in store for you in those <a href=\"/products/btpy91pu\"\
  >Wrath of the Righteous</a> booster packs!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ border=\"0\"> </a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Here we have an Apocalypse Locust, a\
  \ great-looking figure that actually snuck its way into this set thanks to a mistake\
  \ we made here at Paizo. You may recognize the locust from the pages of the <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy91ds\">Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4</a>, making it one of the fastest\
  \ creatures to make the leap from a bestiary to a miniature in the whole time we've\
  \ been doing this. That's because the Apocalypse Locust was actually supposed to\
  \ be a <i>different</i> locust demon, the equally hideous Derakni Demon from page\
  \ 43 of <a href=\"/products/btpy8yvk\">Pathfinder Campaign Setting: The Worldwound</a>.\
  \ The Derakni, as servants of the locust demon lord Deskari, arch-demon of the Wrath\
  \ of the Rightous campaign, are prevalent monsters throughout the Adventure Path.\
  \ Somewhere behind the scenes (I blame myself), we mixed up our locust demons, and\
  \ the wrong one made it into the set. Happily, both the Apocalypse Locust and the\
  \ Derakni Demon are the same size, and look quite similar (hence our mistake), so\
  \ the error resulted in a more or less perfect proxy (I personally think the Apocalypse\
  \ Locust looks cooler). There will not be a Derakni Demon figure in this set—an\
  \ oversight I hope to fix as soon as I can slip one into a future set. Until then,\
  \ we've got this guy, who really is all kinds of cool. The Apocalypse Demon is a\
  \ Large, uncommon figure.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71408_Grimslake_500.jpeg\"\
  > <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71408_Grimslake_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"> </a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Speaking of <a href=\"/products/btpy8yvk\">Pathfinder\
  \ Campaign Setting: The Worldwound</a>, our friend the Grimslake here comes from\
  \ that very same reference book! Grimslakes are nauseating creatures that dwell\
  \ on Abyssal battlefields, feeding from the demonic dead. Those suckers on its tail\
  \ can suck the bone marrow from your body, so you really don't want to get too close\
  \ to these things. This is up there on the list of the most disturbing figures we've\
  \ made to date, and it makes a perfect proxy for any kind of gross worm monster\
  \ you might need. The Grimslake is a Large, uncommon figure.</p> \n     <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71408_StauntonVhane_500.jpeg\"\
  > <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71408_StauntonVhane_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"> </a>\n     </div> \n     <p>This former paladin now serves the dark\
  \ powers of the Abyss and plays a critical role in the campaign's second adventure,\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy90qb\"><i>Sword of Valor</i></a>. And I honestly can't\
  \ tell you much more than that without including major spoilers, so I'll leave it\
  \ at saying he is probably the best dwarf figure we've done to date, and his armor\
  \ and paint scheme make him great to pair with the <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lfh4\"\
  >Deskari Cultist</a> we previewed many many weeks ago. Staunton Vhane is a rare,\
  \ Medium figure.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71408_Nocticula_500.jpeg\"\
  > <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71408_Nocticula_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"> </a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Not all demons are enormous monsters with giant\
  \ claws and huge fangs. Some of them, in fact, are rather alluring. Such is the\
  \ case with Nocticula, demon lord of assassins, darkness, and lust. She was the\
  \ first succubus and a full-on demigoddess in her own right, and the bad news is\
  \ that the player characters may have to fight her. The good news is, you'll have\
  \ the perfect mini for the job. Nocticula stands about a head higher than most Medium\
  \ figures, giving her a sense of gravitas on the battlefield. WizKids did a great\
  \ job on the fine details of this figure, from the intricate hand crossbow to the\
  \ magical runes etched into her wings. She also has three tails and feet made of\
  \ red-hot magma. Nocticula is a Medium figure slated at the rare rarity.</p> \n\
  \     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71408_Gimcrak_500.jpeg\"\
  > <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71408_Gimcrak_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"> </a>\n     </div> \n     <p>We probably won't do another demonic familiar after\
  \ this set (or all that many demons in general—at least for a while), but when we\
  \ saw Wayne Reynolds's art for this little bastard on the cover of <a href=\"/products/btpy921g\"\
  >Pathfinder #78</a> we couldn't resist bringing him to prepainted plastic to faithfully\
  \ serve his master, whom we'll get to in a moment. Gimcrak here is more than an\
  \ ordinary demonic familiar, for he's also a <i>witch's</i> familiar, granting him\
  \ (and his master) extraordinary powers. He also has an adorable leather mask and\
  \ some great sculpting for such a small figure. Gimcrak is a Small (really Tiny,\
  \ but on a Small base for stability) creature slated at the rare rarity.</p> \n\
  \     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71408_AreeluVorlesh_500.jpeg\"\
  > <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71408_AreeluVorlesh_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"> </a>\n     </div> \n     <p>The last regular-sized figure in the\
  \ Wrath of the Righteous set is Areelu Vorlesh, the creator of the Worldwound and\
  \ the demon lord Deskari's most powerful servitor. Arguably, this half-succubus\
  \ witch/demoniac/archmage (CR 27!) is the \"big bad\" of the entire <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/wrathOfTheRighteous\"\
  >Wrath of the Righteous Adventure Path</a>, and WizKids has delivered with a great-looking\
  \ figure. From her metal gauntlet to her looming wings, this figure has a ton of\
  \ dimensionality to it that makes it a true stand-out. Areelu Vorlesh is a rare,\
  \ Medium figure, and is very likely the last succubus-type figure we'll make in\
  \ a long time. Having done about a half-dozen, I'd say we've covered this niche\
  \ effectively (or uncovered it, if you're in a particularly succubussy mood).</p>\
  \ \n     <p>And that's it for the regular figures in the <a href=\"/products/btpy91pu\"\
  >Wrath of the Righteous</a> set! Next week we'll take one last, lingering look at\
  \ the absolutely enormous Deskari, and then it's off to a set that perfectly matches\
  \ our cold weather this week.</p> \n     <p>I hope you all had a great New Year's\
  \ Eve, and that your holiday celebrations were full of festivity, gaming, and lots\
  \ of cool miniatures!</p> \n     <p>We'll see you next week!</p> \n     <p>Erik\
