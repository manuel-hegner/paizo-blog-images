  s ancestry determines which people they call their own, whether it’s diverse and\
  \ ambitious humans, insular but vivacious elves, traditionalist and family-focused\
  \ dwarves, or any of the other folk who call Golarion home. A character’s ancestry\
  \ and their experiences prior to their life as an adventurer—represented by a background—\
  might be key parts of their identity, shape how they see the world, and help them\
  \ find their place in it.</em></p> \n      <h3>Ancestries</h3> \n      <p><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Player Core</em> introduces a variety of ancestries, each with their own heritage\
  \ subgroups. These ancestries and heritages express a character’s culture and influence\
  \ their attributes and abilities.</p> \n      <p>You can get special attribute boosts\
  \ and flaws for your ancestry, such as a goblin getting better Dexterity and Charisma\
  \ and worse Wisdom, or you can freely customize your attributes for any ancestry\
  \ to play exactly the character you want.</p> \n      <p>The ancestries included\
  \ in <em>Pathfinder Player Core</em> are: dwarf, elf, gnome, goblin, halfling, human,\
  \ leshy, and orc.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/30540723-c4b8-4d0c-acf0-2847181e98d8/PZO12001_Ancestries01.png\"\

  \ peoples of Golarion are many, and they have a long history of intermingling or\
  \ dabbling with forces capable of altering the very fabric of a mortal body or soul.\
  \ The children born to such parents might have traits from each of their parents\
  \ or physiological manifestations of the forces their ancestors were influenced\
  \ by, manifesting as a specific heritage. </em></p> \n      <p>In order to reflect\
  \ the great diversity of ancestries and cultures in Golarion, <em>Pathfinder Player\
  \ Core</em> introduces versatile heritages—extra options including mixed ancestries\
  \ and extraplanar origins. The most common among these are aiuvarins and dromaars,\
  \ which represent a mix between human heritage and elven or orc heritage, respectively,\
  \ in whatever way best fits the story of your character and their family.</p> \n\
  \      <p><em>Though a character can have only one heritage and one lineage feat,\
  \ the possible permutations of a character’s background and family tree are virtually\
  \ unlimited. An aiuvarin character might still have a changeling parent whose nature\
  \ is visible in the coloration of their eyes even if they don’t have access to changeling\
  \ ancestry feats, and a pitborn dwarf might very well have an ancestor with fey\
  \ influences on their bloodline, reflected with a fey muse or patron gained through\
  \ their class alongside their ancestral fiendishness. </em></p> \n      <div class=\"\
