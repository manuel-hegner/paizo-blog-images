  Dungeons of Golarion</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Thursday, June 23, 2011</p> \n\
  \    <p>If they weren't such an excellent place to make quick money, I doubt I'd\
  \ ever want to go into an actual dungeon. As it stands, I try to make it a practice\
  \ to only venture into the ones that are worth the trouble. I'm not a fan of slinking\
  \ through sewers, skulking about in guano-reeking caves, or sneaking through a ruin\
  \ that's been picked over by thousands of lesser explorers. Give me a megadungeon\
  \ any day, though. Not only are these things immense (and thus filled with immense\
  \ amounts of treasure), but they also tend to be dripping (sometimes literally)\
  \ with history and lore and stories that can date back hundreds or even thousands\
  \ of years. When you get skunked in a dungeon in the treasure department, it's nice\
  \ to at least come out of there with a wider appreciation of ancient Thassilonian\
  \ art, experience with strange Numerian technology, or tales of close calls with\
  \ primeval wonders and horrors.</p> \n    <p>The Egorian vaults have a fair amount\
  \ of information about the megadungeons of the Inner Sea region, but there are six\
  \ of them that someone seems particularly interested in. Hollow Mountain in Varisia,\
  \ the Red Redoubt of Karamoss just outside of Absalom, the lost dwarven mines of\
  \ Zolurket, Andoran's Candlestone Caverns, the mysterious Pyramid of Kamaria in\
  \ Osirion, and, of course, Gallowspire. The files include several maps of specific\
  \ levels found in all six of these megadungeons, along with sketches of cutaway\
  \ views of the complexes as well. And extensive notes on the monsters, traps, and\
  \ (oh yes!) treasures said to be found within.</p> \n    <p>Some neat stuff. So\
  \ of course I stole it all. I've sent the notes on to a contact in Magnimar, and\
  \ she's going to see to it that they're <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy8g78\">bound and\
  \ distributed</a>. They should be arriving soon—within the month. Until then, though,\
  \ I thought folks would be interested in perhaps a few images of some of the critters\
  \ said to dwell in the dungeons.</p> \n    <p>I don't know about you, but they certainly\
  \ <i>look</i> like the type of monsters who would keep a lot of treasure in their\
  \ lair! I've got my fingers crossed!</p> \n   </blockquote> \n   <div align=\"center\"\
