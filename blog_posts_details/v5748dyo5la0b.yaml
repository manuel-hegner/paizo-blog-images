  artist: "the treacherous trader Amnir. While it's a bit longer than the usual excerpts\
    \ we post here, I hope you'll find it as captivating as I do. Amnir rode along\
    \ the line of wagons. \"Close up there. Close up. Smartly now! Let them see your\
    \ weapons. On your guard, watch my lance point, and keep moving.\" The broken\
    \ towers were grouped around an open circle, which had a huge lump of something\
    \ in the middle that might once have been a monument to civic pride. Three figures\
    \ stood beside the monument. They were gaunt. Tuck-bellied, long-armed, slightly\
    \ stooped. They wore tight-fitting garments of an indeterminate gray color, hoods\
    \ covering narrow heads. Their faces were masked against the wind. The masks were\
    \ worked in darker threads with what appeared to be symbols of rank. The three\
    \ stood immobile, alone, and the ragged doorways of the buildings gaped darkly\
    \ on either hand. Stark's nostrils twitched. A smell of living came to him"
