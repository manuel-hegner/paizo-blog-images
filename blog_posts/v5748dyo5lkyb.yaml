  \ released for Gen Con is huge, especially since it typically combines all the scenarios\
  \ for July and August at once. This year's been an exception insomuch as the number\
  \ of scenarios is positively immense with 15 different adventures across four different\
  \ campaigns: 6 <a href=\"/pathfindersociety/rpg\">Pathfinder Society</a> scenarios,\
  \ 4 <a href=\"/pathfindersociety/rpg\">Starfinder Society</a> scenarios, 3 <a href=\"\
  /store/pathfinder/pathfinderSociety/pfsrpg/scenarios/pathfinderPlaytest\">Pathfinder\
  \ Society Playtest</a> scenarios, and 2 <a href=\"/pathfindersociety/acg\">Pathfinder\
  \ Adventure Card Guild</a> adventures! It's so much that we're breaking our preview\
  \ blogs into three different posts.</p> \n    <p>Thankfully, preparing so many adventures\
  \ has been much more approachable thanks to our growing organized play staff. To\
  \ reflect this, I've asked each scenario's respective developer to chime in with\
  \ their own perspective on these excellent adventures.</p> \n    <p>Speaking of\
  \ scenarios, by now Gen Con GMs should have received many of these in their downloads\
  \ already. As of the time I'm writing this, we've completed all of our work on #9-24,\
  \ #9-25, #10-01, #1-18, #1-19, Playtest #2, Playtest #3, and (just now) #10-00.\
  \ Many of these have already been arriving in GM downloads, and most of the other\
  \ adventures are just going through final checks over the next day or two. That\
  \ means that anything you don't have yet should be arriving soon. Keep in mind that\
  \ when we cued Gen Con GMs to receive these scenarios, you would have received a\
  \ notice that you have them in your downloads; this is a placeholder file that's\
  \ replaced with the actual file once they're on the website. We're regularly running\
  \ the report to grant new scenarios as they're finalized.</p> \n    <p>With that,\
  \ let's get a preview of the Pathfinder Society adventures coming up.</p> \n   \

  ><i>Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild Scenario #1-08: Sanctuary of Drowned Delight</i></a>.\
  \ <i>Beneath Unbroken </i>Waves takes the PCs to the islands and waters off the\
  \ coast of Jalmeray, where the Pathfinders meet a group of undines who have discovered\
  \ the ruins of a monastery containing martial arts techniques lost to Golarion…\
  until now! It's not all fun and games in this coastal setting though, as the PCs\
  \ will also encounter deadly threats like this individual illustrated by Maja Djeke!</p>\

  \ Ever since Season 7, the organized play team's been including more seeker-level\
  \ (i.e. level 12+) content in the campaign, which is a delight because it opens\
  \ up a whole new caliber of narrative. A year ago, the <a href=\"/products/btpy9tld?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-900-Assault-on-Absalom\"\
  >Pathfinder Society helped thwart</a> the so-called Fiendflesh Siege that threatened\
  \ Absalom. In doing so, we learned that several of the Society's old foes had teamed\
  \ up to coordinate the siege, and the Pathfinders have taken it upon themselves\
  \ to personally track down these villains. Agents realized their first victories\
  \ in Qadira in this season's <a href=\"/store/pathfinder/pathfinderSociety/pfsacg/season4\"\
  >Adventure Card Guild scenarios</a>, and we've now cornered two of the masterminds\
  \ in the Five Kings Mountains. There they've taken over an ossuary sacred to Magrim—\
  dwarven god of the afterlife also featured in the upcoming <a href=\"/products/btpya17f?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Faiths-of-Golarion\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Faiths of Golarion</i></a>—and established such\
  \ potent defenses that only an elite team of Pathfinders stand any chance. <a href=\"\
  /products/btpya18i?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-925-Betrayal-in-the-Bones\"><i>Pathfinder\
  \ Society Scenario #9-25: Betrayal in the Bones</i></a> is a Tier 12-;15 scenario\
  \ that concludes Season 9 on a high note. Not only has the author Tom Phillips brought\
  \ his storytelling flair and devious encounter design to bear, but the scenario\
  \ also answers numerous questions that we've been waiting to reveal since as early\
  \ as Season 2. How did an ex-venture-captain use that fateful wish? Why did a particular\
  \ faction leader take the actions she did? And how will it all end in these final\
  \ confrontations?</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\">\n     <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderSociety/20180718-RubyPhoenix.jpg\"\

  \ The Year of the Ten kicks off with a multitable interactive special for both the\
  \ Roleplaying Guild and the Adventure Card Guild: <i>#10-00: The Hao Jin Cataclysm</i>\
  \ (links here for the <a href=\"/products/btpya1xz?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-1000-The-Hao-Jin-Cataclysm\"\
  >Roleplaying Guild</a> and <a href=\"/products/btpya1zl?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Guild-Adventure-1000-The-Hao-Jin-Cataclysm\"\
  >Adventure Card Guild</a> versions). Long ago, the legendary sorcerer Hao Jin built\
  \ a demiplane by tearing locations and peoples out of Golarion and stitching them\
  \ together into an eclectic realm, bound together by the strength of her magic.\
  \ The Pathfinder Society has made numerous excursions into this Hao Jin Tapestry\
  \ demiplane over the years, cataloguing sites of forgotten history and forging alliances\
  \ with isolated cultures. However, the demiplane is now in critical condition. Unless\
  \ the Pathfinder Society acts quickly, the plane's very fabric will rip apart. It\
  \ won't be an easy fix, however. The Society's allies on the Hao Jin Tapestry are\
  \ in peril, as malevolent forces prey upon the chaos and actively accelerate the\
  \ destruction. Even the tapestry's own repair mechanisms have malfunctioned horribly\
  \ and now terrorize its inhabitants. Will you help save the demiplane from certain\
  \ destruction? Mike Kimmel is the author for the RPG portion of this adventure,\
  \ and Ron Lundeen wrote the ACG portion. If you want to discover the role this magnificent\
  \ phoenix (illustrated by Marko Horvatin) has to play in the adventure, come join\
  \ us at Gen Con or another convention near you.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\"\
