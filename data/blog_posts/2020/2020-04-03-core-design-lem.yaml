  >Valeros</a>. Today I’m going to talk about friend and boon companion to everyone\
  \ (unless perhaps your name is Meligaster), the iconic bard <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo5la2j?Meet-the-Iconics-Lem\"\
  >Lem</a>.</p>\n              <p>“Player types” is one of those perennial topics\
  \ in games and game design, equally as likely to come up in discussion of everything\
  \ from the first tabletop RPG to the latest AAA console title. Anyone who’s looked\
  \ into any of the academic, professional, or hobby-level study of games and gaming\
  \ is likely to have run across at least one attempt to analyze things from the player\
  \ point of view. Whether it’s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartle_taxonomy_of_player_types\"\
  >Bartle’s Taxonomy</a>, lists of fantasy roleplaying archetypes, <a href=\"https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerArchetypes\"\
  >3 well-known player psychographics</a>, or the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNS_theory\"\
  >G/N/S model</a>, both gamers and game designers frequently revisit the (important!)\
  \ idea that different parts of games are better for different kinds of game experiences.\
  \ There are many examples of this in PACG, but few stand out as clearly as our awesome\
  \ halfling helper, Lem.</p>\n              <p>When we first put together characters\
  \ for <em>Rise of the Runelords</em>, we knew that we wanted Lem to be good at all\
  \ sorts of things. As a bard, we wanted him to have a bunch of skills. Mike flat-out\
  \ refused to let him out the door without Knowledge. Gaby wanted him to be charming\
  \ and friendly, and Paul and I both wanted to make sure that he was good enough\
  \ at a variety of things that he could choose to fill any gaps in your particular\
  \ party. That said, he’s a halfling with a troubled history, so he clearly had some\
  \ weaknesses. We gave him a large Knowledge bonus, made him a Charisma powerhouse\
  \ to sometimes rival Seoni, and made sure he had a respectable starting point for\
  \ Ranged weapons and both Arcane and Divine spellcasting. For his cards list, he\
  \ has a good spread of card types, letting him dabble in any type while also giving\
  \ him multiple choices for focus. A large hand size represents his inherent versatility\
  \ as well as a relative fragility, and the option to get into either weapons or\
  \ light armor means that he can make use of almost any card you find.</p>\n    \
  \          <p>For most people, though, Lem’s powers are really where he shines brightest.\
  \ With a long list of skills and proficiencies, we knew that we’d need his powers\
  \ to be relatively concise (a theory that I think we proved, the bad way, in Skull\
  \ &amp; Shackles). We wanted to emphasize his helpfulness and his versatility, so\
  \ he got one power for each. The first lets him spend cards from his hand to help\
  \ other nearby characters at <em>whatever they wanted to do</em>. This power has\
  \ a cost—putting a card from your hand on the bottom of your deck—which helps make\
  \ it an interesting choice. Over time, players are likely to realize that this “\
  cost” is often a benefit: if you have cards in your hand that are useful some of\
  \ the time, but just not right now, you can tuck them away for later use, opening\
  \ up space to draw new cards without the increased risk of death that comes from\
  \ just discarding at the end of your turn.</p>\n              <p>The second power\
  \ helps create the “just the thing!” moments, since it’s easy for him to swap out\
  \ a “good, but not right now” card for an especially relevant card from his discard\
  \ pile. These two powers together let Lem invest in a wide variety of cards, even\
  \ cards with potentially niche utility. If you find that a particular card isn’\
  t useful right now, you can recharge it to help (first power) or swap it for something\
  \ more relevant in your discard pile (second power). There’s also an element of\
  \ mastery at play here—once you get a good handle on the game, you realize that\
  \ after Lem casts a spell, he might want to recharge it—and thus get it back for\
  \ “free,” but not immediately. Or he might want to fail to recharge it, so he can\
  \ swap another spell for it next turn. The latter approach costs him a “hit point”\
  \ if he’s going to take damage, but it lets him have more control over when he has\
  \ certain key cards in his hand.</p>\n              <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n\

  or a lot—of help from Lem.</p>\n              </div>\n              <p>When we were\
  \ putting together characters for <em>Skull &amp; Shackles</em>, we knew we wanted\
  \ to change things up a little. Ideally, the characters would feel recognizably\
  \ themselves, but would also be changed by their experiences at sea. (If you’re\
  \ familiar with Lem’s history, you probably understand that falling victim to a\
  \ press gang is especially transformative for him!) While S&amp;S was letting us\
  \ swap in some new iconics, we all agreed we wanted to bring back Lem in some form:\
  \ Swashbuckling Lem, Sea Captain Lem, Dread Pirate Lem.</p>\n              <p>With\
  \ that in mind, and with apparently wanton disregard for the extra pain we were\
  \ dropping on the shoulders of the Paizo layout team (<em>To Sonia, Crystal, and\
  \ Sarah: we apologize. Deeply. Again.</em>), we added Craft to Lem’s list of skills\
  \ (enabling both Alchemy and ship repair) and gave him our new power for Finesse\
  \ weapons. This new, tougher Lem swapped a spell out for a weapon, dropped hand\
  \ size by one, and gained weapon proficiency. His “resourcefulness” power was reduced\
  \ to let him get back recharged cards more quickly (by shuffling), and his “helping”\
  \ power was increased to let it apply to himself. It’s still possible to build a\
  \ super-helpful Lem, but now he can also be a bit more selfish if he wants.</p>\n\

  \ of a modern major pirate lord!</p>\n              </div>\n              <p>For\
  \ his <em>Bard Class Deck</em> treatment, we wanted to change the focus again, so\
  \ we looked more to the magical side of bardishness—but not bardiche-ness. (This\
  \ also contrasted nicely with the other bards in that deck.) Class Deck Lem got\
  \ a die bump to the top-end d12 Charisma, pushed his hand size back up to variety-and-fragility,\
  \ and focused his powers more on spells. His helping power gained a new trick: if\
  \ he used a Healing card to help others, he also got a little self-healing out of\
  \ it; everybody wins!</p>\n              <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n         \

  \ Balm.</p>\n              </div>\n              <p>Finally, we come to the new\
  \ <em>Core Set</em>. We wanted to build a friendly, helpful, “classic” Lem, using\
  \ our new templates and layout methods. The switch to a vertical layout let us add\
  \ yet another skill to one of our skill-monkey characters without causing the designers\
  \ so much pain (again, we’re sorry!); this let us give Lem Acrobatics out of the\
  \ gate, which makes him seem more like the halfling he is, and also opens up some\
  \ weapons options without requiring two lines of powers text. Adding Instrument\
  \ proficiency lets us cleanly represent his facility without recourse to the clumsy\
  \ “if you have the Bard or Skald trait” wording on each instrument.</p>\n      \
  \        <p>His Knowledge and spellcasting skills drop back down to “great” (from\
  \ “outstanding”), and his first power lets him make up the difference when it counts\
  \ most. His deck list spreads out evenly while giving him at least one weapon (you\
  \ might choose a strong Acrobatics-based weapon, or one of Core’s new helpful weapons).\
  \ Finally, his second power gives him back some of that resourcefulness while avoiding\
  \ the potential repetitive play concerns I always drone on about, and also moves\
  \ the processing to the end of the turn (while the next player is likely already\
  \ starting).</p>\n              <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n               <a href=\"\

  \ Both roles are meant to reflect the performance aspects of Lem, with Busker offering\
  \ access to some nifty street-performer tricks for getting by, especially in Urban\
  \ settings (my favorite being “I’m afraid I cannot fight you… <em>but they can!</em>”\
