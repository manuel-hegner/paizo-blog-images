  >Hello! Allow me to introduce myself. I am Payton Smith, Paizo's new Social Media\
  \ Producer. While I’ve only been here a few weeks, I’ve been working closely with\
  \ the creative team to harness the excitement of Pathfinder Second Edition. The\
  \ drive and passion I've seen to create a version of Pathfinder that is easier to\
  \ learn, faster to play, and yet endlessly customizable is inspiring. It is now\
  \ my privilege to share their enthusiasm with all of you on the <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/officialpaizo\"\
  \ target=\"_new\">official Paizo Twitch channel</a>! </p> \n     <p>Starting this\
  \ Friday, and throughout the next three weeks, please join me as I bring our designers\
  \ to the camera to talk about Pathfinder Second Edition, live. Throughout the stream,\
  \ we encourage you to come on over and ask us your burning questions. We will also\
  \ be giving away SWAG to select stream participants, and if we get 500+ concurrent\
  \ viewers, we will also give away a Pathfinder Second Edition Core Rulebook to one\
  \ or more viewers! See the eligibility note below for more details.</p> \n     <div\

  \ alt=\"A close-up of the Fumbus coins from the first picture. They are a brassy\
  \ looking coin with Fumbus the goblin engraved on them. Above him, the word Pathfinder\
  \ curves along the edge of the coin. Below him, the words Second Edition 2019.\"\
  > \n     </div> \n     <p>Here's the schedule (all times Pacific):</p> \n     <div\
  \ style=\"padding-left: 30px; padding-right: 30px;\"> \n      <p> <strong>\"Character\
  \ Creation\" with Mark Seifter</strong><br> Friday, July 12th, 1:00 p.m. - 2:00\
  \ p.m. </p> \n      <p> Pick the brain of Designer Mark Seifter as he explains Pathfinder\
  \ Second Edition's extensive character customization system. How do you determine\
  \ stats? What choices do you have? What kind of classes are there? How customizable\
  \ are they? </p> \n      <p> <strong>\"Playing the Game\" with Logan Bonner</strong><br>\
  \ Wednesday, July 17, 1:00 p.m. - 2:00 p.m. </p> \n      <p> We all need to know\
  \ the basics of how to play and how Pathfinder Second Edition makes your gaming\
  \ experience more streamlined and intuitive. That's where Logan Bonner comes in.\
  \ Logan will be showing off combat, magic, exploration, the action economy, and\
  \ more. Get into the nitty-gritty of Pathfinder Second Edition's game mechanics.\
  \ </p> \n      <p> <strong>\"Advancing Your Character\" with Stephen Radney-MacFarland</strong><br>\
  \ Friday, July 19, 1:00 p.m. - 2:00 p.m. </p> \n      <p> So now that you've been\
  \ playing your character, overcoming hazards, slaying monsters, and gaining experience\
  \ throughout your adventures, how does leveling work? Senior Designer Stephen Radney-MacFarland\
  \ will join me to elaborate on how your character concept can be brought up to the\
  \ next level. How do you add skills and feats? Maybe you'd like to multiclass? You\
  \ don't want something generic, you want something that's uniquely your own. You're\
  \ going to love the tremendous amount of customization and paths you have to explore\
  \ during the leveling process! </p> \n      <p> <strong>\"The World as We Know it\"\
  \ with James Jacobs</strong><br> Wednesday, July 24, 1:00 p.m. - 2:00 p.m. </p>\
  \ \n      <p> What is in store for your character in the world of Golarion in the\
  \ Age of Lost Omens? We will start with the basics and grow from there with Pathfinder\
  \ Creative Director James Jacobs to elaborate on the detailed countries, biomes,\
  \ creatures, and stories available for you to explore--including our first adventure\
  \ path for Second Edition: Age of Ashes. </p> \n      <p> <strong>\"Running the\
  \ Game\" with Jason Bulmahn</strong><br> Friday, July 26, 1:00 p.m. - 2:00 p.m.\
  \ </p> \n      <p> Who motivates the monsters? Who controls the villagers asking\
  \ you for help? Will the dangerous red dragon kidnap the helpless maiden? Why does\
  \ this darn key keep bringing our party such bad luck? Jason Bulmahn will be sitting\
  \ with me and demonstrating how to wield the cosmic power as a Game Master in Pathfinder\
  \ Second Edition! </p> \n     </div> \n     <p> The clock is ticking. Gen Con 2019\
  \ and the launch of Pathfinder Second Edition release is soon. Learn a thing or\
  \ two about this amazing game as we count down to #Pathfinder2E! </p> \n     <p><a\
