  ></a>\n     </div>\n     <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\">The local\
  \ apparitions were increasingly inhospitable as Samo and Nahoa made their way to\
  \ the feet of the mountains and into the sun-blasted wastes that the orcs of Belkzen\
  \ claimed as their hold. Though her grandmother’s spirit was with her as always,\
  \ the little spirits she knew best from the north—those of river and wave or those\
  \ who hid in the shade of the taiga—had stayed behind in the places to which they\
  \ were accustomed when Samo headed south.</p>\n      <p>She had reached out to the\
  \ spirits of this unfamiliar place looking for aid and information only to be met\
  \ by a recalcitrant and surly apparition who seemed to chase away any other local\
  \ entities. He was Orc and he was Battle, though Samo doubted he was any particular\
  \ orc or specific battle; rather, he seemed an amalgamation of the most prominent\
  \ attributes of this hard place. Her grandmother’s presence had retreated to the\
  \ back of her mind as she made this new spirit the primary focus of her meditations,\
  \ seeking to establish a bond that would allow her to draw upon their knowledge\
  \ of their environs. The spirit warred and wrestled with her as they communed, though\
  \ she sensed no malice; it seemed instead that the spirit’s language was simply\
  \ one of conflict. Perhaps, she quickly realized, fortunately so.</p>\n      <p>A\
  \ pair of spine-covered, wild-eyed boars snorted their challenge from a nearby rocky\
  \ protuberance, the hard-edged nails of their feet tearing troughs in the earth.</p>\n\
  \      <p>“Nahoa,” Samo cried, “watch out!”</p>\n      <p>The large man smiled a\
  \ grim smile as he looked up at the bristle boars. Samo felt an echo of approval\
  \ from the orcish battle spirit she had been entreating, the apparition’s former\
  \ reticence slipping away as their knowledge of battle and Belkzen filled her mind,\
  \ along with some other interesting information.</p>\n      <p>“Do you see there,\
  \ up behind them, Nahoa?” Samo’s question was met with a nod from her mighty companion,\
  \ though he did not take his eyes off the dangerous creatures.</p>\n      <p>“I\
  \ do.” Nahoa’s hands gripped his spear tightly before he thrust down into the ground.\
  \ “Piglets, it would seem. Food in the mountains must be scarce for them to have\
  \ brought their whole family to hunt and scavenge this far in search of it. Maybe...”\
  </p>\n      <p>Without finishing his thought, the former farmer reached into his\
  \ pack, feeling around until his fingers closed on a leaf-wrapped package. Pulling\
  \ it forth, he carefully unsealed it, revealing a cluster of smoked tubers he’d\
  \ prepared a few days earlier. He threw the bundle carefully toward the boars, hoping\
  \ the food might be enough to persuade them to stand down. His offering was perhaps\
  \ too late or too aggressively delivered, however, for as the tubers sailed through\
  \ the air, so too did the spine-covered bodies of the two boars.</p>\n      <p>Samo\
  \ reached for her magic to fling spears of light and spirit at the boars only to\
  \ find the battle apparition all too eager to respond with their own power instead.\
  \ Magic of joyful aggression whirled through her, and before she realized it, she\
  \ was springing into battle alongside Nahoa. The large warrior had left his carved\
  \ spear behind, clearly hopeful that his great strength could subdue at least one\
  \ of the beasts without orphaning their young and stranding them to a slow death\
  \ by starvation.</p>\n      <p>As Nahoa and the larger of the two boars crashed\
  \ to the ground in a tumble of red-stained dust, Samo’s war gavel spun in her hand\
  \ with remarkable lightness, crashing into the other beast with a strength and impact\
  \ beyond what her slight frame should have been capable of. She turned with the\
  \ impact, letting the boar’s quills scratch along the wooden plates of her armor\
  \ as she prepared another strike. The battle spirit’s magic guided her, and she\
  \ howled out a word in Orcish—no doubt the spirit’s language coursing back through\
  \ their bond—that caused her war gavel to strike with unnatural accuracy, amplified\
  \ by a power that enabled the gavel to tear soul as much as flesh.</p>\n      <div\

  \      <br>\n      <p>The boar squealed in pain and danced away as Nahoa surged\
  \ up from the ground, lifting his own boar over his head and hurling the creature\
  \ back toward the outcropping from which it had first approached. Both boars, in\
  \ quite unboarlike fashion, fled back to their young, one snatching up the bundle\
  \ of tubers as it went. Samo unleashed a mighty Orcish war cry, proclaiming her\
  \ victory, as the magic of the battle apparition finally left her.</p>\n      <p>As\
  \ she turned sheepishly toward Nahoa to apologize for the display, she realized\
  \ that her companion was more badly wounded than had been initially apparent. Even\
  \ as the mighty young man cast her a weak grin of confidence, he collapsed to the\
  \ ground, his body covered in brutal tears and punctured through with dozens of\
  \ quills. Samo rushed to his side, pulling the quills from his flesh using the techniques\
  \ taught to her long ago. As she did so, she concentrated on pushing the battle\
  \ apparition aside to allow her grandmother’s nurturing spirit to flow through her\
  \ once more. The war spirit gave ground grudgingly, and Samo laid aside her clan\
  \ hat as sweat dripped down her brow, finally pushing the battle apparition to the\
  \ back of her consciousness and allowing her grandmother to reassert herself in\
  \ Samo’s soul. As she did so, healing magic from their bond flowed freely through\
  \ Samo and into Nahoa’s wounded flesh.</p>\n      <p>When the last of Nahoa’s wounds\
  \ sealed closed, the big man opened one eye to look at Samo.</p>\n      <p>“How\
  \ about next time, I go first, and you hang back and protect me with your magic,\
  \ eh? I’m getting tired of waking up to you covered in my blood.”</p>\n     </blockquote>\n\
