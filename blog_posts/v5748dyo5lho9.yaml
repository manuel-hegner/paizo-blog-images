  \ on a Drunken God</h2> \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"\
  description\">The forests and low hills surrounding them were as bucolic as anything\
  \ the bards described at Cayden's Rest, but Jed's spirits remained low as he followed\
  \ his new companions over the quickly diminishing trail. </p> \n    <p>It was his\
  \ fifth day on the old dirt road. His back ached and his haunches were sore from\
  \ the jostling. The chain shirt didn't fit right—or, rather, his father was a bit\
  \ thinner in his prime than Jed was today. He was hungry, and while he was rationing\
  \ his ale supply, there were but two small barrels left. </p> \n    <p>And of course,\
  \ he had undertaken this momentous quest in the only manner of conveyance he had\
  \ available—the brew-temple's mule cart. His thinking was that the others' horses\
  \ wouldn't be burdened by the camping gear, including the tents Jed had purchased\
  \ at the last minute on his way out of Augustana. </p> \n    <p>Silvestrae and Corogan\
  \ didn't use the tents. They simply slept on the ground. Corogan was nice about\
  \ it, saying he preferred the open air. As for Silvestrae, her disdain was silent\
  \ but palpable. After the first night, Jed left the tents in the cart and slept\
  \ outside with the others—which was one of the primary reasons, though by no means\
  \ the only one, why his back was killing him. </p> \n    <p>The ale he brought,\
  \ on the other hand, was more welcome, and it was going fast. Corogan seemed to\
  \ limit himself to a tankard each evening, but Silvestrae seemed to put away the\
  \ rest of the massive half-orc's share in addition to her own. And yet she held\
  \ her drink well. Jed had put one of his more experimental brews in the cart along\
  \ with a few others, and the half-elf immediately noted the lemon verbena hiding\
  \ behind the hops. She was his kind of customer... at least when it came to ale.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The trail took them northward toward the Arthfell Mountains, long the\
  \ home of Andoran's more rustic denizens. Those who dwelled in the cities thought\
  \ of these hillfolk as little better than barbarians, and the few Jed had met at\
  \ Cayden's Rest certainly fit the bill. Yet they were thoroughly Andoren—fiercely\
  \ independent and desirous of little more than the right to keep farming their land\
  \ and hunting the herds in those inhospitable mountains. </p> \n    <p>So when a\
  \ representative of the hillfolk traveled all the way to Almas with terrible tales\
  \ of the dead rising in the Nogortha Necropolis and sweeping through their lands\
  \ with flame and doom, the Golden Legion had immediately assigned Corogan to investigate.\
  \ </p> \n    <p>In Jed's view, at least, Corogan was one of those rare Eagle Knights\
  \ whose sense of righteousness and justice did not impair his practicality. That\
  \ was evident from his close friendship with Silvestrae, whose modest magical ability\
  \ seemed only to augment her skills at stealth and deception. They bickered occasionally—\
  actually, she bickered at the half-orc, who accepted her barbs with grace and humor—\
  but theirs seemed to be a bond of experience and respect.</p> \n    <p>And loss.\
  \ They spoke little of Rafe, the cleric who died in Cayden's Rest, and Jed was too\
  \ circumspect—and perhaps a touch too intimidated—to ask. Jed knew his presence\
  \ was keeping them from true haste. He could only hope he would be of some use before\
  \ the end. </p> \n    <p>\"Keep up, Caydenite!\" Silvestrae called from up ahead\
  \ on the trail, riding among the shadows of the afternoon sun.</p> \n    <p>Grimacing,\
  \ Jed cupped his hands to his mouth to shout after her. \"The road's getting worse!\
  \ I won't be able to get through soon!\"</p> \n    <p>It was as if Silvestrae's\
  \ disdain and Corogan's weary patience were tangible magic beams, smacking Jed in\
  \ the face. </p> \n    <p>Corogan deftly guided his horse back around toward Jed.\
  \ \"All right. Let's get you on that mule, along with as much of your gear as we\
  \ can. Except for those tents.\"</p> \n    <p>Jed slid off the cart and started\
  \ unhitching the mule, while Corogan began lifting everything out. The half-orc\
  \ was strong, as strong as any Jed had seen, but was possessed of such quiet strength\
  \ and decency that even Jed, who prided himself on his treatment of others, wondered\
  \ if he had been giving half-orcs in general enough consideration. </p> \n    <p>Silvestrae,\
  \ meanwhile, was content to stay on her horse and look utterly impatient with the\
  \ whole thing—except when the two barrels of ale were unloaded. She was willing\
  \ enough to sling one onto her horse's back, even when she had to finally climb\
  \ down from her mount and wrestle it out of the wagon herself.</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Corogan does what it takes for Andoran.</i>\n    </div> \n \
  \   <p>And that's when a twig snapped off toward the trees. Corogan looked up...\
  \ then looked down again, shaking his head in quiet disgust. \"Damn it all...\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Jed's heart raced as he suddenly found himself and his companions\
  \ surrounded by at least a dozen haggard, filthy humans with bows and arrows at\
  \ the ready. </p> \n    <p>\"Whoa! Hey, now!\" Jed yelled, raising his hands. \"\
  We're just traveling the road here! This is still Andoran, is it not?\" The sound\
  \ of Silvestrae's hand slapping her forehead somehow didn't distract Jed from looking\
  \ at the men and women surrounding them. \"Come now, who's in charge here?\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>A rather large, muscular woman dropped her aim for a moment. \"I am,\
  \ and you'd best explain yourselves before we fill you with arrows.\"</p> \n   \
  \ <p>Jed stepped forward, despite Corogan grasping at his shoulder. \"Of course,\
  \ my dear lady. I am Jeddah Cailean, priest of Cayden. These are my companions,\
  \ the lady Silvestrae and Corogan, Eagle Knight of Andoran. Surely you see his sigil?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>The woman snorted and a few of the others chuckled. \"Sigils are cheap,\"\
  \ she said. \"And we ain't had no food to eat in a week, since we been drove off\
  \ our land. So you best step away from that wagon before we send you to meet your\
  \ drunk god.\"</p> \n    <p>Jed looked to Silvestrae and Corogan, and both looked\
  \ ready to unsheathe their blades and have at it. The odds weren't as bad as they\
  \ seemed, for the ambushers seemed to be mostly unarmored and ill-equipped, and\
  \ a few were indeed looking quite thin and wan. Thieves, certainly—but why? They\
  \ had to know their chances were slim against three strong adventurers... well,\
  \ two, at least.</p> \n    <p>\"Cayden, lend me that silver tongue of yours,\" Jed\
  \ whispered in prayer. \"And be quick about it before blood is spilled.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>He then looked up at the woman with a divinely enhanced smile. \"How about\
  \ this instead: Tell your people to lower their bows, and we'll partake of some\
  \ of Cayden's ale together. And you can tell me what's driven you and yours to such\
  \ desperate measures, eh?\"</p> \n    <p>The woman looked wide-eyed at Jed for a\
  \ long moment, even as Silvestrae began to unsheathe her sword. Then the woman smiled.\
  \ \"All right, then. Ale in hand is better than blood on the ground. Stand down!\"\
  </p> \n    <p>With but a little confusion and murmuring, the bandits lowered their\
  \ bows and stowed their arrows, and Jed turned to Silvestrae and Corogan with a\
  \ smile. \"Better to lose a barrel of ale and gain some knowledge of the area, eh?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Corogan responded with a smirk and a clap of Jed's shoulder, while\
  \ Silvestrae merely frowned as she shoved her blade back in its scabbard. \"A waste\
  \ of good ale on these grubs,\" she muttered.</p> \n    <p style=\"text-align: center;\"\
  >∗∗∗</p> \n    <p>The \"grubs\" in question were indeed local hillfolk, driven from\
  \ their homes some months past by the sudden surge of undead in their lands. They\
  \ had left their village with only the clothes on their backs, and what little could\
  \ be thrown into packs and baskets. Many were left huddling around fires at night,\
  \ exposed to the elements or trying to find rest in makeshift shelters. Food was\
  \ scarce, as the tilled fields were far away and the mindless undead had no compunction\
  \ about killing game and leaving the carcasses to rot, such was their hatred of\
  \ all life. </p> \n    <p>\"And so we came down to the road to try our hand at briganding,\"\
  \ said the woman, whose name was Toska. With some soap and clean clothes, Toska\
  \ might have simply been seen as fiercely maternal. But here along the road, wearing\
  \ dirty rags and full of anger, she almost rivaled Corogan in savage mien. \"Fact\
  \ is, though, nobody travels this road much except farmers and tinkers—no real food\
  \ nor gold. So we try to catch a few fish, maybe some squirrels and rats. And we\
  \ starve while them skeletons and zombies sit on our lands.\"</p> \n    <p>They\
  \ were seated around a fire, the sun having gone down an hour ago. The first barrel\
  \ of ale was gone, and the second newly tapped, much to Silvestrae's great annoyance.\
  \ But the ale—along with Jed's simple spell of charming—had the desired effect.\
  \ The mood had lightened considerably, and most importantly to Jed, nobody got hurt.\
  \ </p> \n    <p>Jed had thought to ask one of the hillfolk to serve as guide, but\
  \ when he asked Corogan about it during a pause in the drinking, the half-orc merely\
  \ snorted. \"Not necessary. I can follow the land to the necropolis. We bring along\
  \ one of these people, we'll be slowed down. Can't protect 'em, either. Best to\
  \ leave them be.\"</p> \n    <p>And so Jed went back to the revelry. He took the\
  \ time to talk with each of the men and women—and a few older children mixed among\
  \ them—to ensure they were as healthy and hale as could be expected. He used his\
  \ divine gifts to create a bit of water and food they might share—sadly, not enough\
  \ to fill all their stomachs, but it was better than nothing. </p> \n    <p>One\
  \ after another, the hillfolk drifted off to sleep. There were but two left standing—\
  actually, sitting slouched on a log and singing off-key in slurred voices—when Corogan\
  \ nudged Jed awake. \"We're leaving,\" he said. </p> \n    <p>Jed looked to see\
  \ Silvestrae already on her horse—and Jed's mule already packed and waiting for\
  \ him. \"Now? In the middle of the night?\"</p> \n    <p>Corogan nodded, and Jed\
  \ could see him work up the patience to explain. \"You did well to make friends\
  \ with them. We have a little more information now, and no one was killed. But we\
  \ can't have them following us. Or changing their minds about wanting our stuff.\
  \ Let's go.\"</p> \n    <p>Jed staggered to his feet, wincing at the pain in his\
  \ back and haunches once more, and staggered toward his mule, clumsily mounting\
  \ it and following the others quietly away from the camp. By daybreak, they had\
  \ reached the point where the trail began rising toward the stark, gray peaks of\
  \ the Arthfell Mountains. </p> \n    <p>As daylight strengthened, the road grew\
  \ less traveled. By lunch—a meal that Jed missed more than he cared to admit at\
  \ this point—the trail became more ambitious. By the time the sun disappeared behind\
  \ the tallest mountain peak, all three companions had to walk their mounts to avoid\
  \ tumbling off the foot-wide dirt path and into a ravine. </p> \n    <p>Yet Corogan\
  \ insisted on going forward, convinced that a clearing was just around a bend. It\
  \ took three such bends and a half hour of steep climbing in the growing dark, but\
  \ he was correct. The trail emerged into a small mountain meadow. Buildings rose\
  \ in the distance, dimly lit by the dwindling rays of sun escaping around the peaks.\
  \ </p> \n    <p>\"We can shelter there,\" Jed said. \"Perhaps they even have a bed\
  \ and some ale.\"</p> \n    <p>Silvestrae tsked loudly. \"There are no lights there,\
  \ priest. It's probably been abandoned by the hillfolk. And if it is, that means\
  \ there's undead about.\"</p> \n    <p>Jed turned to Corogan, hoping he might have\
  \ a different take, but the half-orc's weapons were already drawn—a battle-ax in\
  \ one hand, a short sword in the other. \"To the right,\" he hissed. \"Movement.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Silvestrae began whispering words of power and a moment later disappeared\
  \ from view. Jed drew his rapier, forgetting its power for a moment and starting\
  \ at the magical blade's light. </p> \n    <p>A soft moan came from up ahead. Jed\
  \ turned—and saw several figures shuffling down the path toward them. </p> \n  \
  \  <p>\"Zombies,\" Corogan said quietly. \"About twenty or so.\"</p> \n    <p>Jed\
  \ could only see six—and that terrified him even more. He turned to Corogan, only\
  \ to see the half-orc eyeing him expectantly. Right. This is why I'm here.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Stepping forward, Jed took the tankard hanging from his belt and held it\
  \ aloft in his left hand, a voice in the back of his head critiquing the move. It\
  \ was the first time he had ever faced undead, let alone tried to focus his god's\
  \ power to turn them. </p> \n    <p>He cleared his throat and spoke out into the\
  \ darkening sky. \"In the name of Cayden Cailean, I command you to be gone!\" </p>\
  \ \n    <p>Nothing. </p> \n    <p>No power flowed through him as it did when he\
  \ cast his spells. There was no flash of light, no clap of thunder. There was nothing\
  \ except a growing chorus of moans, the shuffling of feet through dirt and grass,\
  \ and the growing stench of rotting flesh. </p> \n    <p>\"Damn it, Cayden,\" Jed\
  \ shouted, his voice breaking. \"You put me here for this! Get rid of these things!\"\
  </p> \n    <p>The zombies kept coming. </p> \n    <p><b>Coming Next Week:</b> Flesh\
