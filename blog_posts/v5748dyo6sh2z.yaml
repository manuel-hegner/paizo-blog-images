  >Lost Omens: Gods &amp; Magic!</a></p> \n     </div> \n     <p>Long, long ago, in\
  \ a small and forgotten corner of the Immortal Principality of Ustalav, there lived\
  \ a girl named Krisalla. She was a child of uncommon patience, and this drew Shyka\
  \ to her, for the Eldest knew the value of a mortal who could let time unspool properly.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>One evening, as the brief summer moths were flying thick through the\
  \ twilight, the Eldest appeared before the child. “Do you wish to touch your hand\
  \ to destiny?” they asked.</p> \n     <p>Krisalla looked up at the blue-gowned figure,\
  \ who appeared to her an ageless woman with light brown skin and a silver-capped\
  \ braid, at once human and unearthly. “How?”</p> \n     <p>“You will lay low a sorcerer\
  \ of terrible power, an unliving monstrosity who will come to grip all Ulcazar in\
  \ his bony fist. You will end his reign of cruelty and will become a hero to those\
  \ who survive to remember your name. But this will not come without cost.”</p> \n\
  \     <p>“What cost?” Krisalla asked, for she was a child of Ustalav and knew the\
  \ grim ways of its curses.</p> \n     <p>“One life,” Shyka answered. “Not yours.”\
  </p> \n     <p>“I accept,” Krisalla said.</p> \n     <p>From a hidden sheath in\
  \ their sleeve, Shyka drew out a scroll bound by a white ribbon figured with cracked\
  \ hourglasses. This scroll came from Shyka’s Archives, where the records of the\
  \ future were penned in the past. They held it out to Krisalla, and as the girl\
  \ took it from Shyka’s slender fingers, the Eldest flickered and shifted to an androgynous\
  \ youth in the same garb, but now with a different symbol at the neck.</p> \n  \
  \   <p>Krisalla showed no surprise at this, for why should one be surprised by the\
  \ transformations of a god? “What shall I do with the scroll?”</p> \n     <p>“Read\
  \ it if you like,” Shyka said, “though most mortals are happier without knowing\
  \ their futures. Otherwise, hold it safe. When the time to do more comes, you will\
  \ know.”</p> \n     <p>Then the Eldest was gone, and Krisalla was alone.</p> \n\
  \     <p>Decades passed. The girl became a woman, married, had three daughters of\
  \ her own. Her husband fell ill and died; her children became mothers in turn. </p>\
  \ \n     <p>And in this time, at first from afar, a cold and withered shadow began\
  \ to stretch across Ulcazar. Bones and wraiths rose up from the dark places in the\
  \ mountains, and they gathered into an army of the hateful dead. Rumors of the lich-king\
  \ at their head grew ever closer and more urgent, until finally Krisalla, now an\
  \ old woman, knew that the day for Shyka’s gift had come.</p> \n     <p>She opened\
  \ the scroll. With fearful eyes and trembling hands, she read what Shyka had written,\
  \ long ago or long before. Then she rolled it up again, and closed her eyes over\
  \ her tears, and sent for her youngest daughter.</p> \n     <p>“You must flee Ulcazar\
  \ at once,” Krisalla told her daughter, “or it will mean your life. The sorcerer-lich\
  \ Darocath is coming, and it is written by a god that he will kill you in Ulcazar.\
  \ Therefore, you must go to Amaans with all haste, because if you stay here, you\
  \ will surely die.”</p> \n     <p>“Yes, mother,” her daughter said, and fled.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>But neither mother nor daughter knew that Darocath had already come\
  \ to Ulcazar. The lich’s armies held the border village of Borsov, and there they\
  \ caught Krisalla’s daughter. Darocath’s creatures killed her, but not before their\
  \ master heard of the woman who had tried to flee Ulcazar to escape a god’s prophecy.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Struck by curiosity, Darocath ordered his forces to Krisalla’s village,\
  \ where they seized the old woman. From her he took the story and the scroll, and\
  \ then he left her weeping with her family as he swept off to study the Eldest’\
  s message. He scanned impatiently past the tale of Krisalla’s life, and he saw the\
  \ words written for him:</p> \n     <p>“You will come to the House of Eternity,”\
  \ it said, “and you will die.”</p> \n     <p>Darocath laughed, amused as he had\
  \ not been in centuries, as he read the instructions Shyka had given him for finding\
  \ his way in. “I am dead,” the lich said to his lieutenants, “and I do not fear\
  \ time’s watcher.”</p> \n     <p>Indeed, for years piled upon years, Darocath had\
  \ sought a way into the House of Eternity, for it was the manipulation of time and\
  \ the mysteries of the future that had intrigued the lich beyond his mortal span.\
  \ Now all those secrets had been given to him freely, and he would not be intimidated\
  \ away from using that key.</p> \n     <p>Abandoning his army, Darocath ventured\
  \ through a breach into the First World, and then followed the tangled and treacherous\
  \ path that Shyka had set for him to the House of Eternity.</p> \n     <p>The Eldest\
  \ met him there. “Lich.”</p> \n     <p>“Many.” Darocath studied Shyka with the same\
  \ half-forgotten savor of curiosity. The lich had trained his sight to see across\
  \ a certain span of time, and so he saw Shyka as a figure blurred across multiple\
  \ faces and heights. “You invited me here.”</p> \n     <p>“To die,” Shyka agreed.\
  \ “Would you like to visit the Archives?”</p> \n     <p>“What will you allow me\
  \ to read?” Darocath asked. He had no intention of obeying the Eldest’s restrictions,\
  \ but he was curious.</p> \n     <p>“Everything,” Shyka said. “I will let you walk\
  \ the Archives as I do.”</p> \n     <p>Suspicious but intrigued, the lich climbed\
  \ the mountain stairs after the Eldest, circling around the castle’s crumbling base\
  \ until they came at last to the gaping maw of its entrance, pitted with rusting\
  \ spikes and shards of age-discolored wood. Inside, the House of Eternity was in\
  \ equal disrepair, all dust and cobwebs and stale gray gloom.</p> \n     <p>Yet\
  \ though the Archives’s books sagged on shelves of mold-spotted wood and its scrolls\
  \ were brittle and yellowed by time, its grandeur awed Darocath. The lich scarcely\
  \ glanced at the scholars’ books; it was Shyka’s writings he had come for. “You\
  \ will let me read these?”</p> \n     <p>“Yes,” the Eldest said.</p> \n     <p>So\
  \ Darocath went into the Archives.</p> \n     <p>For a year and a day he absorbed\
  \ himself in the Eldest’s journals of the future, while in the world outside, his\
  \ army collapsed from neglect and infighting, and the spell-wards of his tower crumbled\
  \ for want of tending. The lich forgot his own experiments into manipulating the\
  \ strands of time, for why should he labor so arduously to uncover the secrets that\
  \ were already laid out for him?</p> \n     <p>All that the lich wanted to know\
  \ was his. Any question he could conceive of was answered and had been answered\
  \ before ever he imagined it. In the Archives of Shyka the Many, he saw the map\
  \ of time laid bare of its mysteries, and so Darocath came to realize a terrible\
  \ thing.</p> \n     <p>To live this way, in all moments at once, was to exist without\
  \ curiosity. It was to realize that all his efforts at mastering his own fate came\
  \ to a nullity, and that the illusions of choice and control were just that, and\
  \ that even he, a creature of unfathomable brilliance and magic, could not escape\
  \ the slow snares of fate.</p> \n     <p>All was known, and all was written, and\
  \ nothing was left to wonder.</p> \n     <p>The lich sat with this truth in silence\
  \ and turned it over in his mind for a day and a night. Darocath could see no flaw\
  \ in his conclusion. The answers were written in the Archives; the outcome was foreordained.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>And so he plucked out the stone that held his unliving heart, and placed\
  \ it on a plinth in surrender, and let himself collapse into dust and despair.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>And in a dusty corner of the Archives, on a page buried in an unremarkable\
  \ book that the mighty lich had never thought to open, the lettering changed minutely.\
  \ But only minutely. Because, in Darocath’s story, the ending did not change.</p>\

  \ \n    <p>On the northern reaches of Varisia’s Lost Coast stands Windsong Abbey,\
  \ a forum for interfaith discussion tended by priests of nearly twenty faiths and\
  \ led by a legacy of Masked Abbesses. At the dawn of the Age of Lost Omens, Windsong\
  \ Abbey suffered as its faithful fought and fled, but today it has begun to recover.\
  \ A new Masked Abbess guides a new flock within, and the <i>Windsong Testaments</i>—\
  parables about the gods themselves—are once again being recorded within the abbey’\
  s walls. Some of these Testaments are presented here as Golarion’s myths and fables.\
  \ Some parts may be true. Other parts are certainly false. Which ones are which\
  \ is left to the faithful to decide.</p> \n   </div> <!-- tags:  Web Fiction, Pathfinder\
