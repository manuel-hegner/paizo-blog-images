  \     <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\"></p> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Greetings,\
  \ friends! It's that time of year again where we begin to assemble our organizing\
  \ committees for our major conventions!</p> \n     <p>Now, we haven't done this\
  \ in at least a year, if not longer, so let's talk about what that means. For our\
  \ major shows (such as PaizoCon and Gen Con), we have a volunteer organizing committee\
  \ that runs our organized play space. This group works closely with me, as the Organized\
  \ Play Coordinator, to determine the schedule, recruit GMs, and get them everything\
  \ they need to make the show a success!</p> \n     <p>Obviously, there's a <em>lot</em>\
  \ about 2022 that's up in the air. If we've learned anything from the past two years,\
  \ it's that we can't predict the future. However, I want to share what our current\
  \ plans are, with the understanding that they may change significantly.</p> \n \
  \    <p>We are currently investigating running our major shows as <b>hybrid shows</b>.\
  \ This would mean that we would have both a physical presence at the event as well\
  \ as online offerings, featuring the same scenarios that are premiering at the physical\
  \ shows. As a result, we're looking for applicants who have the ability to assist\
  \ with both physical and online events. Safety requirements and all those sorts\
  \ of things will be announced well in advance of physical shows, we're not ready\
  \ to talk about those yet, but rest assured that Organized Play will be following\
  \ the latest CDC Guidelines as well as the show's safety policies to keep attendees\
  \ safe.</p> \n     <p>Below is some specific information about the shows we're currently\
  \ looking to form committees for: <b>PaizoCon 2022</b>, <b>Gen Con 2022</b> and\
  \ <b>PaizoCon Europe 2022</b>. There may be additional shows added to the major\
  \ convention schedule next year (such as PAX Unplugged), and if we add more, we'll\
  \ do a similar call for committee members. There are some positions we know we're\
  \ looking for, but we're also seeking general interest for all our shows; let us\
  \ know if you're interested and what skills you bring to the table!</p> \n     <p>Please\
  \ note that joining a committee is a significant commitment; there is a lot of preparation\
  \ work to do to get ready for a show, and especially coming out of two years of\
  \ not having physical shows, we'll be doing a lot of rebuilding to figure out our\
  \ new processes. Committee members are compensated with convention rewards as if\
  \ they had GMed the maximum number of slots at the convention. Additionally, committee\
  \ members who are not already Venture Officers are granted benefits for the year\
  \ at the VL or VC level, depending on their position. Note that anybody is free\
  \ to apply for a committee; we welcome those who are not already Venture Officers!</p>\
