  \ itemprop=\"description\">This week I'm revealing two amazing figures from June's\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9bc6\"><em>Dungeons Deep</em></a> set of <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\"\
  >Pathfinder Battles</a> prepainted plastic figures. The idea behind this set is\
  \ to present high-utility figures based around a rough \"dungeon\" theme. This allows\
  \ us to include whatever figures we want to, rather than attempting to adapt a specific\
  \ adventure or Adventure Path. That's resulted in a few \"dealer's choice\" selections,\
  \ letting us pick whatever we want for no reason other than \"we think it looks\
  \ cool.\"</p> \n     <p>Up until about a two years ago, \"we think it looks cool\"\
  \ really meant \"Erik Mona thinks it looks cool,\" as before that point I was more\
  \ or less solely responsible for the selections in each set. That all changed when\
  \ we added our Licensing Coordinator Michael Kenway to our team to help me out with\
  \ the miniatures and other projects that involve working with teams outside the\
  \ Paizo office to create cool Pathfinder-related content. Mike has been an invaluable\
  \ assistant to me as he ushers sculpts, paint plans, comic sketches, soundsets,\
  \ and scripts through the approval process.</p> \n     <p>But Mike Kenway is much\
  \ more than just a paper-pusher. He got his start here at Paizo as an editorial\
  \ intern, and has always had a keen interest in the Pathfinder RPG. In fact, every\
  \ day at noon you can find Mike in our employee break room, running or playing in\
  \ a daily Pathfinder campaign with several members of the Paizo staff. He knows\
  \ his stuff, and his attention to detail is absolutely amazing.</p> \n     <p>So,\
  \ a few sets back, I decided to reward Mike's excellent work by giving him an opportunity\
  \ to choose a miniature of his own to include in a set—I think it was Legends of\
  \ Golarion. Unfortunately, that set was the first to see a scale-back in the number\
  \ of figures per set from 55 to 45, and Mike's enthusiastic selection didn't make\
  \ the original cut for a variety of reasons. But it's been waiting silently in the\
  \ shadows since then, eager for a chance to spread carnage when a slot became available.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Mike's first choice was this horrific Bone Golem:</p> \n     <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150417-BoneGolemFront.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150417-BoneGolemFront_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>The Bone Golem appears on page 133 of <a href=\"/products/btpy8odu\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3</em></a>, where it clocks in at CR 8 and includes\
  \ a creeptastic power known as \"Bone Prison,\" in which it tosses some of its constituent\
  \ bones at you to form a cage of bones that crushes you. A great guy to have at\
  \ a party, or to protect the evil lair of a necromancer. In the image above we see\
  \ the Bone Golem from the front, a jumble of skulls, ribcages, and muscle tissue\
  \ just waiting to give a great big bear hug to your deserving player characters.\
  \ The detail on this figure is insane. Take a look at his back:</p> \n     <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150417-BoneGolemBack.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150417-BoneGolemBack_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>More skulls. Maybe one day he'll add yours to his collection?\
  \ The Bone Golem is a Large, rare creature. Way to go, Mike!</p> \n     <p>While\
  \ we're on the subject of golems, let's check out the set's other major construct:</p>\
  \ \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150417-ClockworkGolem.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150417-ClockworkGolem_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Here we have the Clockwork Golem, from page 137 of\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy8hif\"><em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2</em></a>. If you're\
  \ familiar with that book, you'll note that the design here is quite different.\
  \ While the original version has a cool illustration, it didn't really sell the\
  \ \"clockwork\" element as much as we would have liked, and its unusual limbs seemed\
  \ ill-suited for a 3D miniature. So we had the creature re-illustrated for the <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy90q0\"><em>Pathfinder Pawns Bestiary 2 Box</em></a>, and\
  \ that's the version we used as the basis for this miniature. The Clockwork Golem\
  \ is a Large, rare figure.</p> \n     <p>And that's it for this week! To make sure\
  \ you don't miss either of these two cool figures, please consider setting up a\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy8o6b\">Pathfinder Battles Ongoing Case Subscription</a>!</p>\
  \ \n     <p>I'll be back next week (unfortunately one year older, as my birthday\
  \ is Tuesday) with a special birthday treat—my personal favorite figures from the\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9bc6\"><em>Dungeons Deep</em></a> set!</p> \n     <p>Until\
  \ then, I remain...</p> \n     <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p> \n    </div>\
