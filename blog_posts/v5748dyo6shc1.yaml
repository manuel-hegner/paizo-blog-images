  \    </div> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">When the explosions\
  \ started, Navasi’s first thought was, <em>This should speed up the wait, at least.</em></p>\
  \ \n     <p>They’d been hired to escort a caravan running supplies to one of the\
  \ smaller colonies just in the Diaspora. Rather than provide security on ship, their\
  \ employer had told them it would be more efficient to use small, single-person\
  \ starfighters to counter the raiding tactics of the local pirates. Which meant\
  \ traveling to the military supply station nearest to the caravan, Okira Station,\
  \ where the Pact Worlds government stored surplus ships. </p> \n     <p>The plan\
  \ was to sign some the leases, pay some rental fees, pick fighters, and rendezvous\
  \ back with the caravan when it came out of Drift. Navasi had mixed feelings about\
  \ the job, since she was technically wanted dead or alive in the Diaspora by the\
  \ Sixth Finger, the interplanetary thieves’ guild she once worked for. </p> \n \
  \    <p>But a job was a job. </p> \n     <p>As office workers ran out of the building\
  \ in panic, Navasi and her team moved to the nearest window to survey the situation.\
  \ Navasi couldn’t help but smile at the fleeing civilians. The bureaucrats in Okira\
  \ had been doing their utter best to bore her team to death, loading them with long\
  \ waits and endless waiver forms rather than part with any of their precious fighters.\
  \ Those pen pushers all seemed to have vanished now that the guns were out, leaving\
  \ Navasi and her team to their own devices. </p> \n     <p>Outside, swarms of steel-gray\
  \ fighters with cockpits of crimson glass flew strafing patterns over the outpost.\
  \ Navasi wondered for a moment if the Sixth Finger had finally caught up to her.\
  \ But she knew that was wrong. This wasn’t the pirates’ style. Nor did any of these\
  \ ships display the familiar sigils. </p> \n     <p>If the Sixth was going to even\
  \ the score, they’d send someone to do it up close and personal. There seemed to\
  \ be no pattern to this raid beyond “do as much random damage as possible.” No,\
  \ this attack had nothing to do with her or her crew. They were just unlucky bystanders\
  \ who happened to be caught in the crossfire. Already, Okira Station security was\
  \ launching its own ships in response, leading to that deadly, graceful ballet of\
  \ single-fighter combat. </p> \n     <p>Navasi was still wondering what they should\
  \ do when Obo, ever spoiling for a fight, ignited her doshko and said, “Don’t suppose\
  \ these cowards will put boots on the ground. Very well, let’s go kill them in the\
  \ sky.”</p> \n     <p>Navasi was aware that Obo thought she relied on diplomacy\
  \ too much. In this instance, though, she was inclined to share the vesk’s preferred\
  \ tactic. There was a time for talk, but they were already past it. Right now, it\
  \ was time for fire and chrome. </p> \n     <p>“Obo’s right,” she said. “It’s not\
  \ safe on the ground. Everyone pick a ship.”</p> \n     <p>The vesk grinned as Navasi\
  \ vaulted over the front desk and opened the computer terminal. Pathetically simple\
  \ security took only a moment to override. After that, a few seconds of searching\
  \ allowed her to find the docking bay level outside their building. She punched\
  \ in the release codes and disarmed all the docked fighters’ cryptolocks. </p> \n\
  \     <p>“Are you sure, captain?” Velloro asked. Navasi followed the lashunta’s\
  \ stare to Barsala. Navasi knew Velloro could fly, but they both knew Barsala had\
  \ only minimal piloting skills. The kasatha scientist was brave, reliable, but she\
  \ preferred to work on the ground and provide backup on a ship. These single-person\
  \ fighters were incredibly intuitive—a child could fly one—and they’d all practiced\
  \ in simulators to prepare, but that mattered little if you were flying up against\
  \ space raiders who knew what they were doing. </p> \n     <p>“Well, we wanted to\
  \ take these fighters for a practice ride, right?” said Navasi, leaping back over\
  \ the counter. “What better way to get a field test? Barsala, just stick close to\
  \ us.”</p> \n     <p>The walls shuddered under the impact of more artillery, causing\
  \ dislodged dust to rain from the ceiling. Alarms screamed. It wouldn’t do to stay\
  \ here and have the office collapse on their heads. Better to return the favor and\
  \ see these bastards off. Who knows? The Okira Station officials could be so grateful\
  \ that Navasi might be able to squeeze a discount out of them.</p> \n     <p>“The\
  \ fighters out there have been unlocked and primed for takeoff,” Navasi said, leading\
  \ them toward the door. “Fan out once we’re in the open! Don’t run in a straight\
  \ line—don’t give them anything easy to shoot at.”</p> \n     <p>Easy to say, harder\
  \ to do. Still, this wasn’t her crew’s first time getting shot at. They left the\
  \ stale office air and entered a smoky hell. Overhead, most of the raiders were\
  \ occupied by Okira Station’s deployed response, but more than enough were still\
  \ concentrating on doing as much damage as they could. </p> \n     <div class=\"\

  \ by Tomasz Chistowski</p>\n     </div> \n     <p>Velloro formed a shield out of\
  \ concentrated entropy and moved forward. Barsala followed behind, hesitant, no\
  \ doubt trying to decide which ship would be best. Heedless of the destruction raining\
  \ down on them, Obo ran straight for the starfighter with the biggest guns. Navasi\
  \ saw one that reminded her of the ships she flew back when she was a pirate with\
  \ another name. That would do nicely. </p> \n     <p>She’d just started to board\
  \ her choice when she heard Barsala cry out. The kasatha biohacker stumbled but\
  \ got to her feet quickly, her eyes wide. She still hadn’t chosen a fighter. She\
  \ also didn’t notice the raider’s ship barreling down on her, guns blazing. </p>\
  \ \n     <p>But Velloro did. Entropy shield raised, he leapt in front of Barsala\
  \ as the two were enveloped in a fiery explosion. </p> \n     <br> \n     <hr> \n\
  \     <br> \n     <p>Velloro felt zero hesitation leaping in front of Barsala. He\
  \ was the Castrovel Crusher and could take the damage. Not only was protecting others\
  \ instinctual for him, he was only returning the favor. Had not Barsala treated\
  \ all their wounds countless times? </p> \n     <p>He didn’t hesitate. He never\
  \ did, which was how he’d won in the arena all those years. </p> \n     <p>Still,\
  \ the raider’s plasma blast was more powerful than he anticipated. It burned through\
  \ his entropy shield, dissipating it, overwhelmed the energy and platemesh layers\
  \ of his armor, burning him up inside and out. He tried to dissipate the heat as\
  \ best he could, but the pain was intense. When the smoke cleared, Velloro looked\
  \ down at his blistered and cracked skin and his shredded armor. He’d survived,\
  \ but it was a near thing. He wasn’t sure about flying now, though. </p> \n    \
  \ <p>Barsala’s head eclipsed his view of the smoky sky. </p> \n     <p>“Hold still,”\
  \ she said and quickly brought out her medkit. In moments, she injected him with\
  \ several syringes of various colors and applied salves where the burns looked the\
  \ worst. Through his hazy vision, Velloro admired the calm poise on the kasatha’\
  s face. </p> \n     <p>Then he noticed something else as well. </p> \n     <p>“\
  There’s a two-person fighter over there,” Velloro said. “I can fly, you can shoot.”\
  </p> \n     <p>“That sounds like a fair trade,” Barsala said as she injected more\
  \ restoratives. Already, he felt worlds better and leapt to his feet. </p> \n  \
  \   <p>“Wait, one more,” Barsala said. She pulled forth a green syringe. “If I’\
  m going to rely on your reflexes, I want them to be sharp.” Velloro hated the idea\
  \ of stims to make him fight better—it felt uncomfortably close to cheating—but\
  \ if they were both going to fly, it wasn’t just his life in the balance. He nodded\
  \ and Barsala plunged the injector into him. Immediately, he felt his senses crackle\
  \ as though electric. Time seemed to slow. The air smelt of melted plastic and sulfurous\
  \ flame. </p> \n     <p>Navasi and Obo had already taken off. Best to follow them.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“After you, friend,” Velloro said, as the biohacker jumped in the two-person\
  \ cockpit. </p> \n     <p>“Velloro. Barsala, do you copy?” Obo’s voice growled over\
  \ the fighter’s intercom. “What’s your status? Are you all right?”</p> \n     <p>“\
  Why Obo, I didn’t know you cared,” said Barsala. </p> \n     <p>“I’m a little worse\
  \ for wear,” Velloro said, “but Barsala patched me up quick.”</p> \n     <p>“Glad\
  \ to hear it,” cut in Navasi from her own fighter. Velloro could see her ship moving\
  \ to engage the raiders. “Now get to the sky. Time for a little payback.”</p> \n\
  \     <p>“Roger that,” said Velloro as he fired up the fighter’s engines. “You ready,\
  \ Barsala?”</p> \n     <p>He heard the weapon systems on their ship’s go live with\
  \ a deadly hum. When Barsala spoke, the kasatha scientist no longer sounded scared.\
