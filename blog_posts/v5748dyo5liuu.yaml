  > \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">I've got a lot of favorite parts of the Pathfinder\
  \ campaign setting—if you've been following along for the last few years, there's\
  \ a good chance you already know a few of them. Since we created the Pathfinder\
  \ world, I've had a chance to explore the pits of Hell in the <a href=\"/products/btpy8a6f\"\
  ><em>Book of the Damned</em></a>, some of Golarion's mightiest treasures in <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8u7k\"><em>Artifacts &amp; Legends</em></a>, and the gothic nightmare\
  \ of Ustalav in both <a href=\"/products/btpy8j5u\"><em>Rule of Fear</em></a> and\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9e43\"><em>Pathfinder Tales: Bloodbound</em></a>. But\
  \ in all that time there hasn't been a good opportunity to fully detail my favorite\
  \ of Golarion's countless organizations. With the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/hellsRebels\"\
  >Hell's Rebels</a> and <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/hellsVengeance\">Hell's\
  \ Vengeance</a> Adventure Paths, though, that's changed. This month, at long last,\
  \ you'll learn more than has ever been revealed about the Pathfinder world's most\
  \ infamous champions of law: the Hellknights.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\"\

  \ their first appearance in the <a href=\"/products/btpy8bd9\"><em>Rise of the Runelords\
  \ Player's Guide</em></a>, Hellknights have been a part of the Pathfinder campaign\
  \ setting. In those crazy frontier days of Golarion's creation, we didn't have all\
  \ the setting's details fully defined. As a result, part of the goal of the player's\
  \ guide for our first Adventure Path was to fake it. To that end, I wrote in a whole\
  \ weave of loose ends, threads suggestive of places yet to be visited, threats without\
  \ faces, and groups bound to be enemies or allies. One of these organizations—described\
  \ among the ranks of paladins, if you can believe it!—were the Hellknights. There\
  \ wasn't much more than a name for the group, but the grim title immediately stuck,\
  \ so much so that we got our first glimpse of these dark armored crusaders as early\
  \ as <a href=\"/products/btpy8029\"><em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #2: The Skinsaw\
  \ Murders</em></a>.</p> \n    <p>Over time there'd be drips and drabs revealing\
  \ more on the Hellknights, particularly in our campaign setting hardcovers and in\
  \ two meaty articles I wrote for <a href=\"/products/btpy8b8h\"><em>Pathfinder Adventure\
  \ Path #27</em></a> and <a href=\"/products/btpy8b9h\"><em>#28</em></a>. Liane Merciel's\
  \ newest novel, <a href=\"/products/btpy9e45\"><em>Pathfinder Tales: Hellknight</em></a>,\
  \ also has more than a little to do with these grim mercenaries. But beyond those\
  \ books, there hasn't been a ton more on the relentless order. It's been too long.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The drought ends now.</p> \n    <p>Today presents the first of three\
  \ previews of <a href=\"/products/btpy9ipr\"><em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Path\
  \ of the Hellknight</em></a>. While my name's on the book's cover as author, this\
  \ title owes most of its coolest bits to star developers Amanda Hamon-Kunz and John\
  \ Compton, who not just contributed a host of ingenious new player options, but\
  \ made me sound like I know what's what. Creative Design Director Sarah Robinson\
  \ also somehow managed to outdo herself once again, not just by wrangling incredible\
  \ art, but by creating a gorgeous interior evocative of dark iron and bloody crimson.\
  \ As for the content, today I'll show you a bit from the first chapter, a section\
  \ that provides an overview of the Hellknights as a whole, the group's history,\
  \ methods, philosophies, and the like. Throughout this series I'll also be showing\
  \ off snippets and symbols of all seven of the major Hellknight orders, starting\
  \ with the Order of the Chain and Order of the Gate.</p> \n    <h2>Order without\
  \ Mercy</h2> \n    <p><a href=\"/products/btpy9ipr\"><em>Path of the Hellknight</em>'s</a>\
  \ first chapter focuses on the Hellknights as an organization, their history, their\
  \ unyielding philosophy—the Measure and the Chain—and more of the traditions and\
  \ trails that bind their distinct orders. There's also a fantastic piece of art\
  \ depicting the Hellknights' founder, Daidian Rhul, along with details on his deeds\
  \ and mysterious disappearance. The section also includes a discussion of what it\
  \ means to play a Hellknight character. Being zealots, Hellknights are similar to\
  \ paladins in some ways and bring with them some of the challenges one might expect\
  \ with inflexible heroes. To that end, the section includes big picture advice for\
  \ players and GMs alike planning to bring Hellknight characters into their games—\
  such as the following.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><b>Hellknight Philosophy\
  \ at the Table:</b> Hellknights seek to embody supreme order, refuse to compromise\
  \ their ideals, and do everything they can to uphold their philosophies. People\
  \ and circumstances that don't fit into their definition of order must be stamped\
  \ out to meet their vision of progress. For some, this extends to whole religions,\
  \ cultures, or philosophies. When making a character, discuss with your group whether\
  \ a Hellknight character is right for your party—Hellknights and law-breaking characters\
  \ are unlikely to work well together. Also, discuss with the group and GM how appropriate\
  \ themes of intolerance are in your game. Behaving in ways that make other players\
  \ uncomfortable simply because your character is a Hellknight is neither respectful\
  \ nor fun. Consider that lawful neutral Hellknights of any order tend to focus on\
  \ the harsh judgment of societal vices, while lawful good characters usually work\
  \ at the organization's fringes, hunting down criminals and bringing justice to\
  \ civilization's frontiers. Lawful evil members are the ones who tend to commit\
  \ acts of prejudice and intolerance. Remember that every Hellknight order has members\
  \ focused on different tasks, meaning that it's your choice whether your member\
  \ of the Order of the Nail is either a righteous traveling judge or a vicious murderer—\
  make the character that's right for your entire group.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n\
  \    <p>Beyond this introduction chapter, the book spends considerable space focusing\
  \ on the various Hellknight orders. Each section features details on the order's\
  \ organization, philosophy, citadel, prominent members, tenets, suggested rules\
  \ for Hellknight characters, and new options for Hellknight heroes and villains.\
  \ Every one of these chapters begins with an overview of fundamental information,\
  \ including rules elements that tie in with the new Hellknight Obedience feat—an\
  \ option similar to <a href=\"/products/btpy94wj\"><em>Inner Sea Gods</em></a>'\
  \ Divine Obedience feat—which grants a host of new powers to an order's most fanatical\
  \ members. All one has to do is take the feat... and perform an excruciating daily\
  \ reckoning. I'll show off the reckonings here, but the powers themselves can wait\
  \ for now.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderCampaignSetting/PZO9293-CitadelGheradesca.jpg\"\

  \ this first chapter, <a href=\"/products/btpy9ipr\"><em>Path of the Hellknight</em></a>\
  \ turns its attention to each of the major Hellknight factions. For this first preview,\
  \ here are a few glimpses of the Order of the Chain and the Order of the Gate.</p>\
  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <div class=\"blurb180\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderCampaignSetting/PZO9293-OrderOfTheChain.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderCampaignSetting/PZO9293-OrderOfTheChain_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n      <br> <i>Illustration by Damien Mammoliti</i>\n     </div> \n     <p\
  \ class=\"stat-block-title\">Order of the Chain</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block\"\
  ><b>Symbol</b> hand wrapped in chains<br> <b>Headquarters</b> Citadel Gheradesca,\
  \ near Corentyn<br> <b>Leader</b> Lictor Uro Adom (LN male human fighter 5/Hellknight<sup><a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy8ief\">ISWG</a></sup> 7)<br> <b>Members</b> guards, sleuths,\
  \ trackers, victims of outlaws<br> <b>Armor Features</b> lock-and-chain design,\
  \ manacle-like gauntlets, helms reminiscent of iron prisoners' masks<br> <b>Favored\
  \ Weapon</b> flail<br> <b>Reckoning</b> Crush your limbs with tightened chains.\
  \ Gain a +2 bonus on combat maneuver checks when attempting to disarm, grapple,\
  \ or trip opponents.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>The Order of the Chain counts\
  \ among its ranks the greatest Hellknight bounty hunters and jailors. Believing\
  \ that everyone has a vital role to play in society, the order seeks to remove those\
  \ who irredeemably deny their place and who actively impede civilization's progress.\
  \ Rather than slaying criminals and nonconformists outright, the Order of the Chain\
  \ forces most of its captives into lengthy terms of service in work camps. The most\
  \ dangerous malefactors are sequestered in the order's fortress-prison, Citadel\
  \ Gheradesca. Few criminals surrender easily, and so members of the Order of the\
  \ Chain train in a variety of fields: tracking, criminal psychology, investigation,\
  \ and interrogation, to name a few. Little strikes greater dread in a lawbreaker\
  \ than knowing she's become a Hellknight of the Chain's quarry.</p> \n    <p>Along\
  \ with details on the structure and fugitive hunting techniques of the group, players\
  \ of Order of the Chain Hellknights can also expect a variety of new rules and uses\
  \ for restraints, from fetters and iron masks to new uses for common manacles.</p>\

  \ \n    <p>Punishment is a response to the failure of law. To the members of the\
  \ Order of the Gate, true order can be achieved only when criminal behavior is quelled\
  \ before it is committed—preferably before it is even considered. The Order of the\
  \ Gate doesn't seek to convince every free-willed creature of a lawful society's\
  \ virtues, because its members believe that forces stronger than rhetoric must be\
  \ used to prevent the sickness of criminal impulse. Thus, the Order of the Gate\
  \ employs magic to enforce its vision of law.</p> \n    <p>Would-be Order of the\
  \ Gate Hellknights can look forward to learning a measure of this spellcasting order's\
  \ secrets, including invasive new scrying techniques, methods for shielding spellcasters,\
  \ and the order's connections to planes beyond.</p> \n    <p>Keep on the lookout\
  \ for more previews of <a href=\"/products/btpy9ipr\"><em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting:\
  \ Path of the Hellknight</em></a>, as I'll be covering the rest of the major Hellknight\
  \ orders soon, along with plenty more glimpses of the dreads to come.</p> \n   \
