  \     </div>\n     <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Hi, everyone!<br>\n\
  \        It’s hard to believe that the <em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Tian Xia Character\
  \ Guide</em> releases tomorrow! This book brings Asian-inspired fantasy and folklore—\
  from the ancient to the modern—to your table in a torrent of character options.\
  \ The book contains six new playable ancestries, tons of new heritages, pages of\
  \ archetypes and feats, and more to build whatever kind of Tian character captures\
  \ your imagination, whether that’s a peachchild leshy that fights with a magical\
  \ lightning familiar, a tanuki in high-tech armor wielding a <em>frost fair</em>\
  \ glaive, or a yaksha cultivator who follows the heretical path of the bitter scholar.</p>\n\
  \      <p>When we started the Tian Xia project back in 2022, we knew we couldn’\
  t do it alone—only by pooling the passion, knowledge, and shared experiences of\
  \ our stellar cast of writers and designers could we bring the (now gold ENNIE award\
  \ winning!) <em>Tian Xia World Guide</em> to vibrant life or dream up the spooks\
  \ and frights of the Season of Ghosts Adventure Path. <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6to7l?Meet-the-Tian-Xia-Authors\"\
  >You might have heard from some of our authors back in April</a> with the release\
  \ of the <em>World Guide</em>, but we wanted to give everyone a chance to talk about\
  \ their inspirations in the <em>Character Guide</em> as well. Hear from some of\
  \ them below!</p>\n      <p>From all of us, thank you for supporting Tian Xia! This\
  \ vast continent is yours to explore, and we can’t wait to hear what sort of stories\
  \ you tell!</p>\n      <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold; line-height:\

  \ <p>안녕하세요! It's Eren again. I'm absolutely thrilled to have written the new dokkaebi\
  \ goblin heritage! It's been a complete joy to turn the goblin creatures of my childhood\
  \ into something I hope you will delight in. If you ever come across a pot randomly\
  \ at the side of the road, make sure to leave a little treat for the dokkaebi napping\
  \ inside!</p>\n      <p>As always, you can find me chatting about my writing on\
  \ <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/erenahn.bsky.social\">Bluesky</a> and everything\
  \ else on <a href=\"https://www.twitter.com/chromathesia\">Twitter</a>. Hope to\
  \ see y'all around!</p>\n      <br>\n      <h3>Jeremy Blum (he/him)</h3>\n     \
  \ <p>I worked on both the Tian Xia World and Character Guides, and it was a joy\
  \ to contribute to both. For the <em>World Guide</em>, I took Amanandar into a new\
  \ era and turned it into Linvarre, and I also wrote bios for the Avistani gods worshipped\
  \ in Tian Xia, as well as new info on our favorite estranged tengu lovers, Hei Feng\
  \ and Lady Jingxi. For the <em>Character Guide</em>, I wrote Tian innovation feats\
  \ for the inventor class. Can you spot all the references I stuffed in there? There's\
  \ Double Dragon, Dragonball, G Gundam, Street Fighter, the '70s Japanese Spider-Man\
  \ TV show (EMISSARY FROM HELL!), Megaman, and Voltron!</p>\n      <p>When I'm not\
  \ working on Paizo books, I'm a co-designer on <a href=\"https://www.threesailsstudios.com/mappamundirpg\"\
  ><em>Mappa Mundi: An Exploration + Ecology RPG</em></a> for Three Sails Studios.\
  \ It's a TTRPG about exploring the wild and observing the behaviors of monsters\
  \ like a naturalist, and it takes place in a fantastical world vaguely inspired\
  \ by Eurasia. If you like Tian Xia, please check us out, since I've just finished\
  \ writing up the lore for our Chinese-inspired region of Zoumung! For more news\

  \      <p>I am so ecstatic to have worked on the Samsaran ancestry with Kienna Shaw!\
  \ We both wanted to create a world that thrived on cooperation, even in the frigid\
  \ lands of their homeland Zi Ha. It's a brilliant ancestry that incorporates some\
  \ fundamental aspects of Buddhism—samsara, reincarnation, impermanence, karma, and\
  \ enlightenment—and while adapted to a fantasy setting, we tried to ensure that\
  \ we drew authentically from this way of life. Their power comes from the beginningless\
  \ cycle of rebirth and attainment of knowledge as a result. It is truly humbling\
  \ to have been able to incorporate a way of life and teachings that has so greatly\
  \ influenced my own.</p>\n      <br>\n      <h3>Rick Chia (any!)</h3>\n      <p>Hey,\
  \ that’s me! I had the pleasure of writing the handful of critters and blorbos in\
  \ the companions and familiars section. I myself am taught in the soul-sucking ways\
  \ of media production, in many mediums, forms, and (hopefully more) projects.</p>\n\

  \      <h3>Hiromi Cota (they/them)</h3>\n      <p>Haitai! Wannee Hiromi yaibiin!\
  \ I’m Hiromi, and my main contribution to the <em>Tian Xia Character Guide</em>\
  \ was the tsukumogami poppet heritage. For those unfamiliar, tsukumogami are tools\
  \ and other household objects that have gained a spirit through use and/or age.\
  \ They’re one of my favorite creatures in Japanese folklore. As a playable heritage,\
  \ tsukumogami have characteristics that reflect their original utility, as well\
  \ as feats to customize their abilities. As living objects, they're cute and a little\
  \ spooky.</p>\n      <p>My favorite part of the section is a feat called Minuscule\
  \ Mentee, which allows your tsukumogami character to have their own poppet familiar,\
  \ which they will presumably mentor and look after. It’s a lovely way to expand\
  \ the tsukumogami community and gain a little buddy to help your character in their\
  \ travels. I look forward to seeing players try this out and potentially create\
  \ all-tsukumogami parties!</p>\n      <p>I had loads of fun working on Tian Xia,\
  \ and I still have more fun Pathfinder things coming! Once I can talk about them,\
  \ you’ll see details on my Bluesky account <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/hiromicota.bsky.social\"\

  \ &amp; Magic</em>, and <em>Absalom, City of Lost Omens</em>. For the <em>Lost Omens\
  \ Tian Xia Character Guide</em>, I had fun contributing lore inspired by the folktales\
  \ I had grown up with.</p>\n      <p>In my non-gaming related life, I am an educator\
  \ actively promoting diverse voices and experiences. I deliver lectures/presentations\
  \ on regional and cultural studies of the Middle East and North Africa. I also bring\

  \    <h3>Kienna Shaw (she/they)</h3>\n      <p>Hi there! I’m Kienna, and I had the\
  \ pleasure of reimagining the samsaran ancestry alongside Alyx Bui. As a worldbuilding\
  \ nerd, it was an exciting creative challenge to expand the lore of this beloved\
  \ ancestry, ground it within the new version of Tian Xia, and bring it up to date\
  \ with the play philosophy of Pathfinder Second Edition. I wanted to delve into\
  \ what “enlightenment” means for the samsarans, making it a concrete goal that can\
  \ be achieved through many different paths. Whether your samsaran aims to fully\
  \ understand the world through studying a niche subject, mastering a skill, or exploring\
  \ the wondrous dangers of the continent, I hope you’ll find the ancestry’s story\
  \ and roleplay opportunities as rich and rewarding as I did.</p>\n      <p>Writing\
  \ the samsarans for the <em>Tian Xia Character Guide</em> along with the gods Yaezhing\
  \ and Jin Li in the <em>Tian Xia World Guide</em> was a fantastic experience from\
  \ start to finish. You can find me and my other TTRPG work on Twitter as <a href=\"\

  \      <br>\n      <h3>Tan Shao Han</h3>\n      <p>I'm happy the <em>Tian Xia Character\
  \ Guide</em> will reach you soon! Working on Tian Xia for Pathfinder Second Edition\
  \ has been the highlight of my freelance career so far!</p>\n      <p>My <em>Character\
  \ Guide</em> contributions include designing the yaksha ancestry, lore and consulting\
  \ for the wayang ancestry, and hybrid studies and an archetype inspired by wuxia\
  \ and xianxia.</p>\n      <p>As a SEAsian Buddhist, yaksha stories have interested\
  \ me since youth, alongside tales of nagas (whose lore I also got to consult for\
  \ in <em>Pathfinder Monster Core</em>). These yakshas I've created are inspired\
  \ by different stories, filtered through my own perspective as a devotee. While\
  \ you won't find the yakshas in Tian Xia as analogous of any one yaksha tradition,\
  \ my hope is that our work will be true to the ethos and themes of these spirits.</p>\n\
  \      <p>I am also happy to create new lore for the wayangs. I tried to recenter\
  \ SEAsian perspectives by integrating integrated elements of Javanese mysticism\
  \ (kejawèn) as well as themes of SEA's history of anti-colonial struggle. One day,\
  \ we shall all be free! Well, in closing, it is my hope to inspire you to find out\
  \ more about SEA's history and culture through our games. Thank you!</p>\n     \
