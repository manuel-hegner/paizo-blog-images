  \ Untimely Demise</h1> \n   <p>by Robin D. Laws</p> \n   <h2>Chapter Four: Reckoning</h2>\
  \ \n   <p>\"Need I remind you?\" Naphrax asked his prisoner.</p> \n   <p>Tears further\
  \ wet Gaval's bloodied cheeks. \"Of what?\"</p> \n   <p>\"Of what we know.\"</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"You're wrong.\"</p> \n   <p>Jordyar jabbed the poker in Gaval's face.\
  \ \"You've replaced Aruhal in his comely wife's bed, haven't you?\"</p> \n   <p>Gaval\
  \ held his chin up. \"I love Seriza, and Seriza loves me. That doesn't mean I've\
  \ heard of this treasure.\"</p> \n   <p>\"She spoke nothing of it?\" Naphrax snorted.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Outrage stirred Gaval from his agonized stupor. \"She and Aruhal had nothing.\
  \ She'll be better off with my takings, humble as they are!\"</p> \n   <p>\"Liar,\"\
  \ Naphrax spat.</p> \n   <p>Holding the poker out of sight behind him, the dwarf\
  \ sidled up to Gaval, grimacing out a rotten-toothed smile. \"What Aruhal did to\
  \ us is not your fault, boy. But by standing in our way, feeding us ridiculous untruths,\
  \ it becomes your fault. Don't you see that?\"</p> \n   <p>\"How many times do I\
  \ have to tell you?\"</p> \n   <p>\"If you won't spill,\" Naphrax said, \"we'll\
  \ take the woman, and do the same to her.\"</p> \n   <p>Jordyar pressed the glowing\
  \ poker to the prisoner's leg. Gaval screamed, the smoke of burning fabric giving\
  \ way to the steam of blackening flesh.</p> \n   <p>At the window, Ontor looked\
  \ to Luma, his expression asking: are we going to let this happen?</p> \n   <p>Luma\
  \ waved him to silence, then reached into the citysong for the vein of venom that\
  \ pulsed below the city's skin. Magnimar's settlers brought with them their Chelish\
  \ tradition of settling affairs with arsenic, belladonna, and kingsleep. Luma took\
  \ in this dark harmony and projected it outward, to the blood-spotted tunic worn\
  \ by the howling Gaval. In this town, to hear that a man was an apothecary was to\
  \ think not only of healing, but its opposite.</p> \n   <p>Luma's magic-inflamed\
  \ senses confirmed it: tiny speckles of poison dotted his tunic, were ground as\
  \ grime into his fingerprints. She couldn't tell what variety, with so little of\
  \ it still left. But she would bet it was the kind that made an already sick man\
  \ die from seeming natural causes–of pleurisy, say.</p> \n   <p>\"We need him,\"\
  \ said Luma. With a turn of her head she indicated an opposite window, not far from\
  \ the second imprisoned man, the cleric Rieslan. \"It will help if you can get him\
  \ free–that will make it three against two.\"</p> \n   <p><span itemprop=\"description\"\
  >Ontor nodded and was gone. Moments later she saw him appear at the other window.\
  \ Jordyar once more laid the poker on Gaval, this time applying it to his chest.\
  \ Naphrax watched with stoic attention. Fully occupied by Gaval's shrieking and\
  \ squirming, neither man noticed Ontor's acrobatic contortions as he fit himself,\
  \ legs first, through the tiny window. He dropped to the floor with a muffled thud\
  \ that at last turned their heads, but only in time to see him draw his knife and\
  \ slash open the ropes binding Rieslan. Then he bounded up to grab the holy symbol\
  \ from the rafter, tossed it to the priest, and threw his knife at Naphrax. The\
  \ spellcaster only barely managed to duck out of the way, yet the blade succeeded\
  \ in interrupting his gesticulations and spoiling whatever spell he meant to cast.</span></p>\
  \ \n   <p>Luma, meanwhile, shifted her awareness to another vault of the city's\
  \ memory. Her mind traveled to the spires and rooftops, from the heights of the\
  \ Arvensoar barracks tower to the great stone snake encircling the Hippodrome. From\
  \ the mystic vibrations of these structures she pulled out the countless times they'd\
  \ been struck by lightning. Converting them from past thought to present memory,\
  \ she brought into being a vertical bolt of blue energy. It materialized above the\
  \ dwarf, striking the crown of his bald head. He sizzled and convulsed, the poker\
  \ flying out of his hands.</p> \n   <p>Naphrax started to cast a spell at her, but\
  \ Rieslan, holy symbol clutched between gnarled fingers, came up behind him, chanting.\
  \ He shoved his hand past the sorcerer's vest and onto his bare skin. A swirl of\
  \ angry energy shunted from the old priest's fingers into Naphrax's breastbone.\
  \ The sorcerer staggered back, clutching his chest, his arm going stiff.</p> \n\
  \   <p>A wolfish look came over the priest. \"That sluggish heart of yours can't\
  \ take another of those. Can it, Naphrax?\"</p> \n   <p>\"I should have killed you\
  \ in Kaer Maga,\" said the sorcerer, sweating.</p> \n   <p>\"I should have killed\
  \ you in that awful tavern, the moment we met,\" said Rieslan.</p> \n   <p>Jordyar,\
  \ his clothes still steaming slightly, staggered and reached for his axe, positioning\
  \ himself for a lunge against Ontor. Luma called down another lightning bolt, striking\
  \ him as before, and he dropped to one knee, panting. </p> \n   <p>Luma crawled\
  \ through her window, a few last tendrils of summoned fog purling away from her.\
  \ \"Are we done here, gentlemen?\"</p> \n   <p>Naphrax still hadn't caught his breath.\
  \ \"He hasn't told us.\"</p> \n   <p>Ontor cut Gaval's bonds. </p> \n   <p>The freed\
  \ prisoner rose, quaking; Luma indicated his soiled trousers. \"You terrified him.\
  \ You think he wouldn't have sold out the widow in a heartbeat, if he thought it\
  \ would spare him?\"</p> \n   <p>Gaval struggled to form words. \"I take exception\
  \ to—\"</p> \n   <p>Luma cut him off. \"This is not a good time for you to talk.\"\
  </p> \n   <p>He hung his head.</p> \n   <p>\"My brother and I,\" Luma said, \"are\
  \ leaving, with Gaval. He and I have a separate matter to discuss. What the three\
  \ of you do is of no concern to us. You have nothing to gain from further hostilities,\
  \ and would not prevail. Are we agreed, or shall I punctuate that with a lightning\
  \ bolt?\"</p> \n   <p>\"Agreed,\" grunted Naphrax. The others said nothing, so,\
  \ each holding one of the quaking man's arms, Luma and Ontor withdrew–through the\
  \ front door, this time.</p> \n   <p>\"Where do you live, apothecary?\" Luma asked.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"Above my uncle's shop, in Vista.\"</p> \n   <p>To the southeast lay\
  \ the Seerspring Gardens, where they could hire a hansom, and get him to his home\
  \ in the Summit. </p> \n   <p>\"So,\" said Luma, \"let me guess. When you began\
  \ to console her, Seriza was not yet a widow.\"</p> \n   <p>\"I would never...\"\
  \ Gaval tried to pull away, but she held him tight, as did her brother. </p> \n\
  \   <p>\"If we ask her neighbors how often they saw you around before Aruhal died,\
  \ will they tell the same story?\"</p> \n   <p>Gaval slumped into her. \"Very well.\
  \ But I beg your discretion. Calumnize me all you like, but spare the lady's reputation.\"\
  </p> \n   <p>As they crossed an intersection, Luma saw a lurker one street down,\
  \ paralleling their progress. She stopped and waved Rieslan over. The river-priest\
  \ hesitated, then complied, his gait sheepish. \"Never was much for sneaking,\"\
  \ he said, joining the others.</p> \n   <p>\"That was Aruhal's job,\" said Luma,\
  \ moving on. \"Your old comrades have patched up their grievances, it would seem.\"\
  </p> \n   <p>Rieslan fell into step, at her elbow. \"It won't last. Are you sure\
  \ you haven't guessed where the treasure is?\"</p> \n   <p>She shook her head; lying\
  \ was easier when confined to gesture alone. \"When did the four of you have your\
  \ falling out, precisely?\"</p> \n   <p>\"We learned to hate one another long before\
  \ the Demonsweald. But it was after we captured the reliquary that Naphrax and Jordyar\
  \ decided it would be better if Aruhal were cut out of the deal.\"</p> \n   <p>Luma\
  \ raised her faint auburn eyebrow. \"And you had nothing to do with that?\"</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Rieslan made a sour face. \"Let's say, I absented myself from discussions.\"\
  </p> \n   <p>\"A sin of omission, then.\"</p> \n   <p>The old priest laughed. \"\
  My god hungers for the last breaths of the drowning. His moral demands are flexible.\"\
  </p> \n   <p>\"And how did they inform Aruhal of the new arrangement?\"</p> \n \
  \  <p>\"With axe and spell.\" The priest's chuckle suggested that it hardly needed\
  \ saying. </p> \n   <p>\"One more question,\" said Luma. \"Who researched this treasure?\
  \ Aruhal?\"</p> \n   <p>\"Another correct surmise, my dear.\"</p> \n   <p>They parted\
  \ with him at the gardens, and rode with Gaval in the cab. As soon as he was seated,\
  \ the tortured man passed out.</p> \n   <p>\"You were good back there,\" said Ontor.</p>\
  \ \n   <div class=\"blurb360\">\n    <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Ontor2.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Ontor2_360.jpeg\" border=\"0\"\
  ></a>\n    <br> Nothing phases Ontor—not even death.\n   </div> \n   <p>If only\
  \ the others had seen it, thought Luma. Maybe Ontor would tell them. She considered\
  \ asking him to, but knew it would spoil the effect.</p> \n   <p>Arriving at Derexhi\
  \ House, Luma went straight to the library, which smelled of leather, wine, and\
  \ her father's olibanum cologne. Muttering curses at Randred's haphazard reshelving\
  \ habits, she hunted until she found the folio labeled \"Acts and Legends of the\
  \ Holy.\" Giving silent thanks for its alphabetical arrangement, she found the entry\
  \ for the holy warrior Lovag, whose reliquary had so muddled her assignment. To\
  \ Ontor she read aloud:</p> \n   <p>\"And Lovag was betrayed by his companions,\
  \ and slain. Lo, his last loyal servants did burn his body and entomb his bones,\
  \ placing it in a golden reliquary. Even reduced to ashes, Lovag's passion for the\
  \ justice of his great god Aroden burned bright. When the traitor priests beheld\
  \ the shining vessel, he rose from his celestial rest to smite them.\"</p> \n  \
  \ <p>\"What does that mean?\" her brother asked.</p> \n   <p>Luma closed the book\
  \ with a thump. \"It means I think we just found the treasure they've all been looking\
  \ for.\"</p> \n   <p align=\"center\">∗∗∗</p> \n   <p> In the marbled mausoleum,\
  \ Luma and Ontor searched the shelves for Aruhal's name. Near the iron-gated entrance,\
  \ a callow attendant held himself in a posture of bland discretion. He held in his\
  \ hand the document authorizing the disinterment.</p> \n   <p>\"Grave-robbing's\
  \ just not the same when you have the deceased's permission,\" Ontor whispered.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Luma found the brass nameplate bearing the client's name. With the key\
  \ supplied by the attendant, she opened the wood-paneled door to Aruhal's niche.\
  \ Inside rested a large ceramic urn. Luma removed it and set it on the marble table\
  \ in the middle of the crypt's vestibule, where flowers and offerings of incense\
  \ were placed.</p> \n   <p>\"That's not made of gold,\" Ontor said. \"I thought\
  \ the book said Lovag's reliquary was made of gold?\"</p> \n   <p>Luma pulled out\
  \ her sickle and bashed its hilt against the urn. The porcelain crumbled into shards,\
  \ revealing the golden, gem-encrusted reliquary hidden within.</p> \n   <p>Ontor\
  \ addressed the attendant. \"You must have seen this when you poured the ashes in.\
  \ Aruhal trusted you not to switch it?\"</p> \n   <p>The crypt-keeper placed a hand\
  \ over his heart. \"Terrible oaths to the death-goddess bar us from such chicanery.\"\
  </p> \n   <p>Again Luma opened her mind to the strain of citysong that ran thick\
  \ with toxin. She wasn't sure if the spell would work on a man's ashes, but it did–\
  they lit up with the same malicious speckles she'd perceived on Gaval's tunic. </p>\
  \ \n   <p>She smiled. \"Got you,\" she whispered.</p> \n   <p align=\"center\">∗\
  ∗∗</p> \n   <p> Seriza and Gaval perched together, agitated, spines straight, on\
  \ the edge of the divan in the widow's sitting room. Though the swelling had gone\
  \ down on his face, Gaval still showed the signs of his beating and torture the\
  \ day before. Luma almost felt pity for them. If they'd been smart, they wouldn't\
  \ be here, but rather on a boat to anywhere else right this moment.</p> \n   <p>\"\
  So the dwarf was right?\" Seriza said, trembling. \"Aruhal did have a treasure after\
  \ all?\"</p> \n   <p>Luma gestured to the furniture crate she'd pressed into service\
  \ as temporary transport for the urn. \"As I said in my message, he left an inheritance.\
  \ But we were to perform an investigation before giving it to you.\"</p> \n   <p>They\
  \ deserved this, she reminded herself. When Aruhal discarded the saint's remains\
  \ to make room for his own, he no doubt assumed it would be his erstwhile companions\
  \ who'd face this fate. To be murdered for the oldest reason of all–a spouse clearing\
  \ the way for a new lover–felt too cheap, too ordinary, for the complex effort Aruhal\
  \ had expended for his prearranged revenge.</p> \n   <p>Luma hauled loose the crate's\
  \ lid. She picked up the urn and placed it in front of Aruhal's killers, setting\
  \ it down on a low table.</p> \n   <p>Seriza lit up with avarice; she squeezed Gaval's\
  \ hand, squealing her delight. Her excitement overcame his wariness, and he reached\
  \ out to caress the urn's lid.</p> \n   <p>Bursts of green steam vented from holes\
  \ in the urn. The widow and her lover reared back as the unearthly vapor coalesced\
  \ into a blob of floating ectoplasm, and then into an eerie, translucent specter\
  \ in the shape of an old man. It surging through the urn and table into Gaval, where\
  \ bony fingers unfurled and locked around the startled man's throat. </p> \n   <p>Gaval's\
  \ skin whitened and flaked; his hair turned from brown to gray to shocking white.\
  \ His face a mask of terror, he pitched over onto the divan, drained of life. The\
  \ groaning spirit then turned on Seriza. </p> \n   <p>\"No!\" the widow shrieked,\
  \ scrabbling backward on the couch. \"Not you!\" </p> \n   <p>Then all words were\
  \ cut off by those glowing, ephemeral fingers. For a moment, the sitting room was\
  \ filled with the sound of flailing limbs—and then two corpses lay on the divan.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>The spirit twisted, spiraling toward Luma, who prepared herself to call\
  \ down lightning against it. As it hung in the air before her, its contorted face\
  \ calmed. Then the entire apparition dissipated and was gone.</p> \n   <p>Luma waited\
  \ until it was clear that the manifestation had concluded, then called out to the\
  \ man hidden in the hope chest behind the divan. \"I thought you weren't much for\
  \ sneaking.\"</p> \n   <p>\"You detected my presence, did you?\" Rieslan lifted\
  \ the lid and poked his head out. He stared at the urn, still sitting on the low\
  \ table.</p> \n   <p>Luma put her hands on her hips. \"Do you want it? It should\
  \ go back to the mausoleum, but my family wasn't hired to protect it forever. Our\
  \ contract is complete.\"</p> \n   <p>Rieslan scratched at his beard. \"Those are\
  \ Aruhal's ashes in there, and not the saint's?\"</p> \n   <p>\"That's right.\"\
  </p> \n   <p>\"That quite diminishes its value. Still...\" He reached out for the\
  \ urn—then pulled up short, gazing at the shriveled corpses splayed on the divan.\
  \ \"You know, I think I've abruptly lost my desire for this object.\" He unfolded\
  \ the rest of long frame out of the chest and stepped around the couch. He doffed\
  \ his skullcap and bowed to Luma.</p> \n   <p>\"To your health, my lady.\"</p> \n\
  \   <p>Then he let himself out.</p> \n   <p>When he'd been gone for a slow count\
  \ of ten, the door to the kitchen swung open. Ontor, hand on the hilt of a knife,\
  \ sauntered in and leaned over the two ash-skinned corpses, inspecting their terrified\
  \ expressions. \"So the old priest left without making a play for it, huh?\"</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"He's apparently learned a new appreciation for caution.\"</p> \n   <p>Ontor\
  \ whistled. \"I guess you're never too old to learn, but still—what do you want\
  \ to bet that in a few days we hear reports of an old sorcerer and a bald dwarf\
  \ found dead in Aruhal's crypt?\"</p> \n   <p>\"I won't put any money against that,\"\
  \ Luma said, but her mind wasn't on the banter. Inside, she was already thinking\
  \ of the praise she would receive when they returned home—from her father, who would\
  \ give it willingly, and from the rest of her siblings, who would finally be able\
  \ to see what an indispensable part of the team she was. Even they would have to\
  \ admit that she'd executed the mission to perfection.</p> \n   <p>Surely they would.</p>\
