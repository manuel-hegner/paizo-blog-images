  \  <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">The <em>Lost Omens Travel Guide</em>\
  \ has been out for a few weeks and we wanted to take a break from all our travels\
  \ throughout the Inner Sea to highlight the authors who made the book possible.\
  \ There’s been a lot of love for <em>Travel Guide</em> and we wanted to give these\
  \ authors a chance to share their excitement for the book, as well as some information\
  \ about themselves and their projects. If you’ve enjoyed these authors’ work, let\
  \ them know in the comments below or by following them on social media!</p> \n \
  \     <h3>Luis Loza<br> <em style=\"font-size: 15;\">Senior Developer</em></h3>\
  \ \n      <br> \n      <h3>Rigby Bendele (they/them)</h3> \n      <p>My contributions\
  \ to this book consisted of the \"What People Know\" (page 70) and \"Nature and\
  \ Animals\" (page 96) sections. Much of my writing comes from my life, and when\
  \ I wrote the nature section, I went back to my days as a nature camp counselor\
  \ and how my relationship with the world around me changed when I was truly immersed\
  \ in it. While I think that it's easy to get away from the mundane reality of survival\
  \ in a fantasy game, I hope that this section inspires players and GMs to think\
  \ about how their characters would interact with the physical world (and that many,\
  \ many people will enjoy buying pet possums for their characters!).</p> \n     \

  \ and I'm always delighted to be back with my Pathfinder family! I wrote the Cuisine\
  \ chapter (page 38) (including its recipes!) for <em>Travel Guide</em>, and I had\
  \ so much fun writing it that it may just be my favorite contribution to date. I\
  \ had the idea early on to make the author somewhat monstrous—simultaneously reveling\
  \ in the reader's attention while smugly gloating or antagonizing them. The result\
  \ was Maharajah Lakadbaghasura, a rakshasa of sophistication and renown, and I hope\
  \ he wins over some fans! Special thanks to everyone in the Pathfinder community\
  \ who has tried out the recipes. I've been watching your reviews and they're so\
  \ much fun!</p> \n      <p>That brings me to some exciting news—I'm in the process\
  \ of opening Portland's first tabletop roleplaying brewpub with some very talented\
  \ people! TPK Brewing Co. is a majority queer, women-of-color-owned craft brewery\
  \ coming to Portland, Oregon, in 2023. Waiting for you there will be an ale for\
  \ every tale and a staff of full-time professional Game Masters ready to run your\
  \ favorite games. You can learn more at <a href=\"http://tpkbrewing.com/\">tpkbrewing.com</a>\

  \      <h3>Dustin Knight</h3> \n      <p>Greetings, Pathfinders! Dustin Knight here,\
  \ host of <a href=\"http://www.infiknight.net/\">Infiknight Reviews</a>! I'm still\
  \ thrilled to have been assigned the trade section of Travel Guide (page 32). Pre-industrial\
  \ fantasy armchair economics is my jam, and being able to spend a week completely\
  \ obsessing over the price of wool in 13th century Europe helped me pin down realistic\
  \ price points that take into account everything from taxes to spoilage while still\
  \ accurately reflecting the prices of equipment in Pathfinder Second Edition. I\
  \ loved being able to scatter a bunch of Easter eggs throughout my section, especially\
  \ in the art orders, and I can't wait to see if our readers catch them all! If you\
  \ want a hint for one of the more obscure references you can check out my <a href=\"\

  \ enjoy working on sections like that (you might recognize my name from <em>Monsters\

  \ TTRPG project, and I'm also pushing my own TTRPG system to playtest! If you want\

  \ \n      <p>Hi, I'm Stephanie Lundeen, Ph.D., and I've been a freelance writer\
  \ and editor for years. The <em>Travel Guide</em> is my favorite Lost Omens book\
  \ yet. I love world-building—it's my favorite part of writing for Pathfinder. And\
  \ I love traveling in real life and reading travel guides, so this was a perfect\
  \ project for me. It turns out that an imaginary travel guide is even better! Plus,\
  \ to write the Folklore, Mythology, and Religion sections (page 80), I got to do\
  \ lots of research (no joke here, I love to research) as well as be creative. I'm\
  \ so excited to have been a part of this great addition to Golarion, truly one of\
  \ the richest fantasy worlds around.</p> \n      <p>In addition to writing for—\
  and playing a lot of—Pathfinder, I play Starfinder! I'm part of an actual-play Starfinder\
  \ podcast, Intrepid Heroes (<a href=\"http://knowdirectionpodcast.com/category/podcasts/intrepid-heroes/\"\
  >http://knowdirectionpodcast.com/category/podcasts/intrepid-heroes/</a>). I also\

  \ where my humble name graces the cover.</p> \n      <p>In the <em>Travel Guide</em>,\
  \ I wrote the Crime &amp; Law section (page 64), in which our humble hostess, tiefling\

  \ one reviewer called her) describes all the ways in which you can get in and out\

  \ through the Radiant Citadel</em>, and <em>Hunter: The Reckoning Fifth Edition</em>,\
  \ among others. For <em>Travel Guide</em>, I had the absolute pleasure of writing\
  \ two sections – retired assassin Alvinia Lodge’s entry on Time &amp; The Calendar\
  \ (page 6) and tiefling art reviewer Deraaka’s section on Art &amp; Architecture\
  \ (page 50).</p> \n      <p>While there was so much to love about this project,\
  \ including my browser tabs full of dance styles, water clocks and blackout poetry,\
  \ my favorite part was thinking about the ways that living in Golarion makes everything\
  \ from the daily ticking of the clock to the most elaborate expressions of creativity\
  \ different and special. I also deeply enjoyed exploring the ways that culture and\
  \ place impact the way different folks in Golarion tell time, create art, and build\
  \ the structure of their worlds, all through the voices of two people who live there.\
