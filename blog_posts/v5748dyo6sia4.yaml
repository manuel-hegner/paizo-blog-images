  \     <p itemprop=\"description\">Today we’re giving you a sneak peek into our two\
  \ upcoming multi-table interactive events for the 2023 Paizo Organized Play season!\
  \ Every year, Pathfinder Organized Play and Starfinder Organized Play each release\
  \ one multi-table event that can be played with as few as three tables and well\
  \ over 150+ tables at the world’s largest gaming events. These are intended to be\
  \ epic adventures where players work alongside each other to accomplish monumental\
  \ feats and battle great evils. In the past, these events were tied to key story\
  \ points for Organized Play. In recent years, our special events have been standalone\
  \ adventures that tell exciting but isolated stories, making them usable at conventions\
  \ and special events for many years to come. This year, we’re continuing this trend,\
  \ with two exciting interactive events that are standalone, so they can be enjoyed\
  \ by anyone at any time.</p> \n     <p><a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02eey?Starfinder-Society-Special-599-Battle-for-the-Bulwark\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society Special #5–99: Battle for the Bulwark</em></a> debuts at\
  \ PaizoCon 2023 and brings us back to a location many fans have been clamoring to\
  \ learn more about: Sangoro’s Bulwark.</p> \n     <p>Sangoro’s Bulwark was once\
  \ among the most fortified Starfinder Society strongholds outside the Pact Worlds.\
  \ Serving as the headquarters of the Exo-Guardians faction, the massive stone and\
  \ metal fortress was located on a hidden planet in the Vast surrounded by interplanar\
  \ anomalies. It was impossible to locate, much less attack—or so the Exo-Guardians\
  \ assumed.</p> \n     <p>Shortly after the Scoured Stars Incident, in which the\
  \ majority of the Starfinder Society was trapped in a distant trinary star system,\
  \ Sangoro’s Bulwark was lost to unknown forces. No distress signals or survivors\
  \ ever reached Absalom Station. Fearing that the dangerous weapons, technology,\
  \ and experiments stored at Sangoro’s Bulwark would fall into dangerous hands, a\
  \ covert mission to the nearby site of Arsenal was sanctioned, which revealed that\
  \ the Arsenal had been looted and that that Sangoro’s Bulwark was obscured by a\
  \ cloak of magical darkness and would require a sizable contingent to reclaim.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Now, Ixthia the Unbreakable, leader of the Exo-Guardians factions, has\
  \ organized a massive operation to reclaim Sangoro’s Bulwark, rescue any survivors,\
  \ and destroy whatever foul forces dared take the lives of the Starfinders stationed\
  \ there. Stand alongside Ixthia, Radaszam, and Venture-Captain Naiaj in the Battle\
  \ for the Bulwark! This adventure is written by Lysle Kapp and Cole Kronewitter,\
  \ and is intended for 1st- through 8th-level characters.</p> \n     <p style=\"\

  >Pathfinder Society Special #4-99: Blessings of the Forest</a></em> debuts at Gen\
  \ Con 2023 and delves into the forests of Kyonin at the behest of Queen Telandia.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Along the banks of the River Lunel, one of the many rivers that flow\
  \ through Fireani Forest, sits the town of Folien. Folien is a small village, but\
  \ very important as it sits on a ley line node. Specifically, the point of convergence\
  \ for all of these ley lines lies within the basement of the temple to Yuelral in\
  \ the center of the town. This village has existed peacefully and comfortably for\
  \ decades, fostering a community of creativity and support. However, among the depths\
  \ of the forest sits the Tanglebriar, and Treerazer’s appointed generals are as\
  \ quickly chosen and promoted as they are demoted and thrown aside. One such shamed\
  \ demon seeks her revenge on her former leader and has stolen something of great\
  \ importance to him, which she plans to use to corrupt the ley lines and summon\
  \ someone stronger. She’s found a willing partner in a shamed Kyonin noble, who\
  \ seeks to see Kyonin as we know it destroyed and driven to its knees before him.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Queen Telandia has received word of this threat and reached out to the\
  \ Pathfinder Society for assistance through the last remaining member of the Leaves\
  \ of Talhindir, Venture-Captain Viore Ciobanu. Join him as he, Fola Barun, and Eando\
  \ Kline make the journey to Folien and stand against the demonic forces that threaten\
  \ the safety of Fireani Forest! This adventure is written by Ivis K. Flanagan and\
  \ Dennis Muldoon, and is intended for 1st- through 8th-level characters.</p> \n\
