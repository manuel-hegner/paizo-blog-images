  description\">Last Friday we took a look at the envoy. As soon as we announced the\
  \ operative as a class, many fans began to theorize it would act as the \"star thief,\"\
  \ and wondered how it would be different from the rogue class in Pathfinder. There\
  \ are certainly some thematic similarities between the two classes, but just as\
  \ a 16th-century highwayman's tactics and skills were different from a modern hacker's,\
  \ a character with a knack for stealth, security systems, and unexpected attacks\
  \ in Starfinder should be significantly different from a Pathfinder rogue. We need\
  \ a class that can easily serve as spy, assassin, thief, hacker, investigator, and\
  \ trailblazer. That was the spark for the operative, which gets the following description\
  \ in the <a href=\"/products/btpy9qy1\"><em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em></a>:</p>\
  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><i>You're a shadow. You move swiftly, strike suddenly,\
  \ and always have an escape plan. You're a consummate professional, and always get\
  \ the job done, whether it's scouting enemy lines, hunting down criminals, stealing\
  \ and smuggling items, or assassinating key figures. As an operative, you're skilled\
  \ in a wide variety of disciplines and specialties, and use speed, mobility, and\
  \ your quick wits rather than relying on heavy weapons. You excel at the art of\
  \ surprise, whether it's sniping targets from cover or striking while their backs\
  \ are turned. Your cause may be righteous, but you have no problem fighting dirty—\
  achieving your objective is all that matters.</i></p> \n    </blockquote> \n   \
  \ <p>The operative is very much a character skilled at working outside the norms\
  \ of society. Whether committing crimes, hunting criminals, or just living on the\
  \ fringes, operatives find ways to get things done, though their methods don't always\
  \ meet with public approval. This takes skill, so the operative gets 8 skill points\
  \ per level, and 16 class skills. Operatives also get the operative's edge class\
  \ feature granting a bonus to all skill checks (as well as initiative checks). The\
  \ class also receives special bonuses at 7th level with any skill in which the character\
  \ has the Skill Focus feat.</p> \n    <p>The operative knows that sometimes getting\
  \ things done means doing some damage, and the class gains a fair base attack bonus,\
  \ poor Fortitude saves but good Reflex and Will saves, light armor, and proficiency\
  \ (and eventually specialization) with basic melee weapons, small arms, and sniper\
  \ weapons. The operative can augment the damage done with basic melee weapons and\
  \ small arms with his trick attack.</p> \n    <p>Trick attack may sound on the surface\
  \ like Pathfinder's sneak attack, but it works very differently. An operative can\
  \ attempt a trick attack regardless of the combat situation—it's not restricted\
  \ to targets that are flanked or have the flat-footed condition. Instead, the operative\
  \ must make an opposed skill check (normally Bluff, Intimidate, or Stealth, though\
  \ class features can alter that) to gain an advantage over his foe for the trick\
  \ attack to function. At higher levels, the operative can also apply penalties to\
  \ foes hit with a trick attack, beginning with the flat-footed and off-target conditions\
  \ and expanding from there (potentially even applying such effects to sniper weapon\
  \ attacks).</p> \n    <p>Because operatives have different methods and thus focus\
  \ on different techniques, each operative selects a specialization. We present seven\
  \ specializations in the core rulebook—daredevil, detective, explorer, ghost, hacker,\
  \ spy, and thief. Each has an effect on that operative's trick attack (a detective\
  \ can use Sense Motive to activate her trick attack, for example), and grants bonuses\
  \ to specific skills and access to new abilities.</p> \n    <p>Finally, operatives\
  \ also have exploits—special tricks they learn as they gain levels to help customize\
  \ their abilities. While the selection of exploits is fairly small at first, they\
  \ expand as the operative levels up, making increasingly powerful exploits available.\
  \ Here's a sample of a 10th-level exploit (though the ghost specialization receives\
  \ it at 5th level):</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <h3>Cloaking Field (Ex)</h3> \n\
  \     <p class=\"stat-block\">You can bend light around yourself and muffle any\
  \ minor sounds you make, allowing you to nearly vanish when not moving. Even when\
  \ you move, you appear only as an outline with blurry features. This cloaking field\
  \ doesn't make you invisible, but it does make it easier to sneak around. Activating\
  \ the cloaking field is a move action. While the cloaking field is active, you can\
  \ use Stealth to hide, even while being directly observed and with no place to hide.\
  \ Attacking doesn't end the cloaking field, but it does end that particular attempt\
  \ to hide. If you remain perfectly still for at least 1 round, you gain a +10 bonus\
  \ to Stealth checks (which doesn't stack with invisibility) until you move.</p>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"stat-block\">Your cloaking field lasts for up to 10 rounds before\
  \ it becomes inactive. While inactive, the cloaking field recharges automatically\
  \ at the rate of 1 round of cloaking per minute.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>We\
  \ already looked at the envoy last week, and we'll present more information on the\
  \ remaining five classes in the coming weeks. And, of course, you can read the full\
  \ classes this August when the <a href=\"/products/btpy9qy1\"><em>Starfinder Core\
  \ Rulebook</em></a> is released at Gen Con!</p> \n    <p>Owen K.C. Stephens<br>\
