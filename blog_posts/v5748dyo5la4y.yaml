  \ Awesome</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Thursday, September 13, 2007</p> \n   <p>I\
  \ don't know about you, but I have a love/hate relationship with maps in RPG gaming.\
  \ Back in middle school when I first got into the hobby, we might have had a few\
  \ miniatures to represent characters, plus \"terrain\" made from dice, pencils,\
  \ and those little plastic tables that come in the center of your pizza box. It\
  \ wasn't until much, much later, when someone introduced me to D&amp;D 3.5, that\
  \ I finally saw the light and realized that things like battlemats add immeasurably\
  \ to the roleplaying experience.</p> \n   <p>With that realization, however, came\
  \ a new problem: mapping is <i>hard</i>. Even after years of practice, it's still\
  \ annoying to have to stop right in the middle of a crucial scene and scramble to\
  \ count squares and draw out a new room in its entirety each time PCs go through\
  \ the door. (I also have a tendency to spill drinks on the battlemat, but that's\
  \ really my own fault.) </p> \n   <p>Which is where something like our new <a href=\"\
  /store/v5748btpy7y0s\">Flip-Mat: City Market</a> comes in handy. Every village worth\
  \ its salt has a market, so why waste valuable game time drawing it out over and\
  \ over? With City Market, the work's already done for you, and your PCs are free\
  \ to look through every door with impunity. Plus, if you decide you want to switch\
  \ up the layout, just flip it over and use the blank paving beneath the grid to\
  \ build your own town. As with all our Flip-Mats, you can draw on the durable, laminated\
  \ cardstock with wet erase, dry erase, or even permanent marker and still wipe it\
  \ right off when you're done. </p> \n   <p>All of which means that if I were about\
  \ to run, say, the first section of \"Burnt Offerings,\" I'd definitely consider\
  \ checking out City Market and using the time saved to pack in even more goblin-related\
  \ activities.... </p> \n   <p>James Sutter <br>Assistant Editor, <i>Pathfinder</i></p>\
