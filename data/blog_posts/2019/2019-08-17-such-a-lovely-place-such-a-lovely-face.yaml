  \ Age of Lost Omens is the diversity of setting. From classic staples like dragonslaying\
  \ and piracy to outlandish adventures fighting robot scorpions in a rugged wasteland,\
  \ no matter what genre of game you want to play, you can likely find a spot on Golarion\
  \ to suit your interest. With that diversity of setting comes a diversity of people.\
  \ Every nation has its own vibrant cultures, traditions, and ethnicities—not just\
  \ among humanity, but among all of the ancestries found within the Inner Sea region.\
  \ In Golarion, the home of the shattered clans of the Five Kings Mountains, the\
  \ tunnel-dwelling Kulnett of Geb, the dragon-worshiping Mwangi tribes of the Mbe'ke\
  \ and the Taralu, and the completely subterranean grondaksen, there's no such thing\
  \ as playing \"just\" a dwarf.</p>\n              <div style=\"font-size: 13px;\r\

  \              </div>\n              <p>At least, that's always been the theory.\
  \ In practice, many of these disparate cultures haven't gotten the setting support\
  \ they deserved. That's why when we set out to decide on the topic for the second\
  \ of our new World Guides, Luis Loza quickly suggested a book that outlined the\
  \ people of Golarion, especially those not well-covered in the Core Rulebook. In\
  \ the <em>Lost Omens Character Guide</em>, we provide the information and mechanics\
  \ to allow our players to create character concepts from all over the world. Just\
  \ as importantly, we also sought to provide a more focused vision of what these\
  \ people looked like!</p>\n              <p>The <em>Lost Omens Character Guide</em>\
  \ makes heavy use of a rules concept introduced to the Rarity system in the Lost\
  \ Omens World Guide: Access. Many of the ancestry feats in this book have a specific\
  \ basis in the distinct traditions of various cultures and ethnicities, and as such,\
  \ are listed as Uncommon rules options. The Access entry on these feats lists the\
  \ criteria that allow a character to gain automatic access to a rules element. For\
  \ example, the Erutaki people have a tradition of creating magical scrimshaw constructs;\
  \ an Erutaki PC that meets the prerequisites can gain immediate access to the feat\
  \ that represents that ability below, while another PC would have to learn the skill\
  \ from an Erutaki carver or otherwise gain GM permission to take the feat.</p>\n\

  You know the truth behind old stories that tell of sending a fetish of bone and\
  \ sinew to seek vengeance. These old magics allow you to conjure constructs with\
  \ ease. Add the summon construct spell to your spell list. The constructs you summon\
  \ have a distinct ivory scrimshaw appearance, and if you include a drop of blood,\
  \ lock of hair, or other portion of a creature's body as part of the spell's material\
  \ component, the summoned construct gains a +4 status bonus to Perception checks\

  \           <p>That's not to say there aren't a few ancestry feats that are entirely\
  \ dependent on heritage. For example, those of Nidalese ancestry can find the blessings\
  \ of Zon-Kuthon manifesting as they grow stronger, granting the ability to see in\
  \ darkness and other shadowy powers. Since these feats come as a direct result of\
  \ Zon-Kuthon's pact with the people of Nidal, only Nidalese characters can take\
  \ them—while a PC could try to gain access to such feats by seeking out Zon-Kuthon\
  \ himself, as the three Kellid horselords that founded Nidal once did, such a bargain\
  \ would likely have far more dramatic results than a few extra human ancestry feats.</p>\n\

  \ lies the true name of the Snowcaster elves, as well as a number of secrets about\
  \ their true origins. Of course, this knowledge only raises more questions, such\
  \ as whether the events that created the modern-day culture of the Snowcasters are\
  \ also connected to a peculiar oddity of the elven goddess Findeladlara. As an aside,\
  \ the Snowcasters have always had a distinct look, but when ordering art for the\
  \ <em>Lost Omens Character Guide</em>, I asked for a specific addition to their\
  \ silhouette—a pair of antler-like blades that the elves can quickly combine with\
  \ other gear to transform into skis or a sled. These allow the Snowcasters to move\
  \ rapidly over snow and ice, and also makes them somewhat intimidating at a distance,\

  \             <p>With gnomes, we're taking the opportunity to emphasize that not\
  \ all ancestries view ethnicity in the same way as humans do. Gnomes especially\
  \ tend to possess a riot of unusual hair, eye, and skin colors that can often seem\
  \ disconnected from genetics entirely. When gnomes speak of their ethnicities, they\
  \ are usually referring to a natural affinity toward different kinds of magic that\
  \ a gnome might possess—due to their souls' abrupt disconnect from their ancestral\
  \ home in the First World, gnomes are more affected by nearby sources of magic when\
  \ they are growing up. For example, gnomes who grow up near sources of divine power\
  \ have more affinity with magic that changes reality or creates figments, while\
  \ the unsettling fell gnomes have a stronger connection to occult magic or dark\
  \ fey.</p>\n              <p>While goblins often receive little distinction from\
  \ adventurers beyond what color splatter they leave behind, the recent slowing of\
  \ humanoid/goblin aggressions has allowed the differences between goblin cultures\
  \ to become better understood. The forest goblins of the Chitterwood lived through\
  \ the Goblinblood Wars (more accurately, many of them did not live), which has given\
  \ them a different approach to life when compared to the wilder goblins of Varisia.\
  \ A relatively quick goblin lifespan and a traditional worship of Lamashtu means\
  \ that goblins can also adapt to new environments very quickly, leading to some\
  \ startling physiological differences between certain goblin ethnicities. The frost\
  \ goblins of the north have blue skin and occasionally blue fur, but the most striking\
  \ ethnicity of goblin is likely the monkey goblin, which possesses a long tail!\
  \ A heritage for monkey goblins is provided for those who wish to play these unusual\
  \ offshoots:</p>\n              <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n               <a href=\"\

  \ I'd be remiss not to mention Luis Loza's favorite of the bunch: the Othoban halflings,\
