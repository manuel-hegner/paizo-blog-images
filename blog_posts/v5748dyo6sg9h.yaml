  description\">Gen Con lands a little earlier each year, and while that ambitious\
  \ publication schedule means there's tons of new material that arrives in early\
  \ August, it means nearly two months before the next scenarios arrive in late September.\
  \ The long wait is nearly over! The team's been working on a variety of <a href=\"\
  /pathfindersociety/rpg\">Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild</a> scenarios that\
  \ highlight northwestern Avistan in dramatically different ways. Let's hear from\
  \ the developers who worked on each one.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><b>Linda\
  \ Zayas-Palmer (Organized Play Developer):</b> What better way to celebrate the\
  \ approach of Halloween than with some spooky scenarios? This month, we're kicking\
  \ off a new Tier 3-7 two-part series with <a href=\"/products/btpzgd7n?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-1005-Mysteries-Under-Moonlight-Part-1-Testament-of-Souls\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Society Scenario #10-05: Mysteries Under Moonlight Part 1: Testament\
  \ of Souls</i></a>, by Alex Augunas. The city of Magnimar is well known for its\
  \ monuments and the blessings they provide to those who perform the proper rituals\
  \ before them. Now, however, several of the monuments have been corrupted by necromantic\
  \ energy from an unknown source. Out-of-control flames and the eerie moans of lost\
  \ spirits haunt Magnimar's people. Magnimar's Lord-Mayor Grobaras has hired an investigator—\
  illustrated below by Tadas Sidluahskas—but with the situation worsening rapidly,\
  \ the Varisian Council has asked the Pathfinder Society to step in and put an end\
  \ to the corruption. If the PCs succeed here, they'll receive a unique blessing\
  \ that they can use to be particularly awesome in <a href=\"/products/btq01va3?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-10-07-Mysteries-Under-Moonlight-Part-2-The-Howling-Dance\"\

  \ Sayre (Organized Play Developer):</b> I'm really excited to talk about this month's\
  \ Tier 7-11 adventure <a href=\"/products/btpzgd7m?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-1004-Reavers-Roar\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Society Scenario #10-04: Reaver's Roar</i></a> from Steven Hammond.\
  \ <i>Reaver's Roar </i>takes the PCs to the town of Roslar's Coffer in Lastwall,\
  \ where local legend has it a magical helm blessed by Sarenrae lies in the heart\
  \ of an ancient temple known as the Bastion of Light, guarded by a fearsome beast.\
  \ Will the PCs survive the Reaver of Roslar's Coffer, or will someone beat them\
  \ to the prize? And who exactly is this individual illustrated by Dion Harris, and\
  \ what does he have to do with the mysteries hidden within the Bastion?</p> \n \
  \    <p><b>John Compton (Organized Play Lead Developer):</b> Normally we'd have\
  \ just two Pathfinder Society scenarios per month, but with the ongoing <a href=\"\
  /pathfinderplaytest\">Pathfinder Playtest</a>, we wanted to ensure that there would\
  \ be plenty of playtest material. This month we release the fourth and final Pathfinder\
  \ Playtest scenario: <a href=\"/products/btpzgd7o?Pathfinder-Society-Playtest-Scenario-4-The-Frozen-Oath\"\
  ><i>The Frozen Oath</i></a>, a Tier 10 adventure written by Ron Lundeen. The Pathfinder\
  \ Society's increasingly reached out to freelance explorers to map areas, survey\
  \ regions, and perform other long-term studies. Although goblins aren't renowned\
  \ for their scholarly rigor, an increasing number of them have sought out work with\
  \ the Society. A group of Frostfur goblins recently set out into the chilly Crown\
  \ of the World, and only one has returned, carrying a stone tablet that suggests\
  \ the group found a large monument tied to the legendary explorer Aganhei! With\
  \ the summer solstice over, the PCs need to move swiftly to reach the site while\
  \ the warm weather lasts.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb360\">\n      <a href=\"\

  \      <br> <i>Illustration by Tom Ventre</i>\n     </div> \n     <p>Unlike the\
  \ previous three Pathfinder Playtest adventures, this scenario DOES NOT include\
  \ pregenerated characters. As you schedule this scenario, it is important that you\
  \ either include enough time for your players to build characters or have them create\
  \ characters ahead of time.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Speaking of pregenerated\
  \ characters, the team's been continually revising the pregenerated character format\
  \ with the help of our senior graphic designer Emily Crowell. She's created several\
  \ different styles that prioritize different features, such as grouping similar\
  \ information together, presenting an overview of a character's abilities on the\
  \ front page, using a vertical or landscape format, and more. Our aim's to get the\
  \ pregenerated character survey done soon, including some of these pregenerated\
  \ character formats as visuals to get your feedback on the current formats, the\
  \ changes we've explored, and what else you'd like to see.</p> \n    <p>In the meantime,\
  \ be sure you're continuing to playtest Pathfinder's second edition and provide\
  \ us your feedback through the surveys.</p> \n    <p>John Compton, Michael Sayre,\
