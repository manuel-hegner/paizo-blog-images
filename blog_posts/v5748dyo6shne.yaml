  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">“Annnd with a terrifying\
  \ tail whip to the jaw, the Taiga Tyrant is down! She’ll be feeling <em>that</em>\
  \ in the morning! Our winner is the Summer Swordsman of Ekkeshikaar!”</p> \n   \
  \  <p>Cheers resounded through the stadium as the announcer floated high above,\
  \ her voice booming. Triangular pennants lowered in defeat from one corner of the\
  \ arena, as triumphant sunflower bouquets showered down from another.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>Lei took in the sights and sounds as she walked the arena, steaming basket\
  \ in both hands. Usually, she parked the cart outside to cook buns while her daughter\
  \ worked the crowd, but the scamp had run off to “scope out the competition at the\
  \ exhibition matches.” She’d suspiciously taken enough to feed both her and her\
  \ two friends, and she’d been gone for hours. Now, Lei was selling buns herself,\
  \ but to be honest, it was a welcome change to be inside the arena even if the stairs\
  \ were doing a number on her knees. </p> \n     <p>“Speaking of, if you want to\
  \ <em>not</em> feel that in the morning, that last match was sponsored by Plum Rain’\
  s plum wine! For a deluge of flavor and a clear-sky taste, try Plum Rain today!”\
  \ the announcer chirped as attendants ran out to sweep the arena and recover the\
  \ few remaining non-vaporized pieces of the Taiga Tyrant’s spear.</p> \n     <p>“\
  Auntie! Two char siu, two black sugar! Make it fast!” a young man in a feathered\
  \ hat, clearly a merchant, called from a small throng around a nearby railing. As\
  \ Lei ambled over, her eye caught on a pile of coins, and next to it, a bespectacled\
  \ priest with a ledger and slate. Wagers on the tournament, then. She opened her\
  \ basket and passed out the orders, collecting a few blade-shaped coins in payment.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“Fancy a bet?” the young merchant asked.</p> \n     <p>Lei didn’t usually\
  \ indulge, but she caught a glance of the next two contestants readying themselves.\
  \ In one corner a lean Vudrani monk in blue performed a series of warm-up stretches,\
  \ and in the other, a young green-clad warrior paced back and forth. Lei took a\
  \ closer look and played the match out in her mind. Why not? “Blue holds upper hand\
  \ for seven moves, then Green wins in three.” Lei put down the coins she’d just\
  \ collected on the railing. </p> \n     <p>The merchant laughed into his bun. “\
  Maybe you’ve been too busy baking to actually catch the fights, but that guy’s been\
  \ trouncing his competition all day. The girl’s just some initiate out of Indapatta,\
  \ not even fully graduated. I couldn’t possibly take such a bet from someone of\
  \ your...” He looked at Lei’s stained apron, “...means.”</p> \n     <p>Well, no\
  \ mercy then. The baker dumped her earnings for the day out onto the railing. “\
  Three <em>consecutive</em>.”</p> \n     <p>The merchant closed his mouth, opened\
  \ it, and elected to take a bite instead. “You know what, it’s your coin. I meet\
  \ and accept whatever odds the Ministry sees suitable. Witness?”</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ priest nodded. “The Ministry of Numbers and Fortune recognizes this wager and\
  \ sets eight-to-one odds for the skilled baker, pursuant Article 3.51.01 of the\
  \ Gambling Code. By Abadar’s gaze, the deal is sealed.” The Ministry’s judgement\
  \ was as impartial as it was absolute.</p> \n     <p>The peppy human megaphone floating\
  \ above the arena clapped her hands. “Ladies and gentlemen, now that the staff has\
  \ finished disarming the ice snares from that last match—at least, most of them,\
  \ I think—it’s about time to make like a sky chariot and get this show on the air!\
  \ Contestants, take your places, and let fate guide your fists!”</p> \n     <p>“\
  Ready?”</p> \n     <p>Lei smiled. By the end of the day, she’d be sitting in a fine\
  \ hotel room overlooking the bay, with one of those luxurious balcony baths to soak\
  \ her knee in.</p> \n     <p>“Fight!”</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a\

  \ 13px;\">Illustration by Kent Hamilton</p>\n     </div> \n     <p>The man let out\
  \ a roar and opened his fingers into a clawlike form before leaping forward.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“Southern Panther,” Lei and the merchant muttered in unison, before\
  \ their eyes met with a smile. It was always nice when the competition knew their\
  \ stuff. The monk blazed his way across the ground, and the other warrior barely\
  \ blocked the strike, catching a slash across the cheekbone. He followed up with\
  \ a swift flurry of attacks, and the initiate didn’t fare much better, barely turning\
  \ away each.</p> \n     <p>“Two moves to Blue.”</p> \n     <p>“He has the advantage\
  \ in speed,” the merchant said, and Lei didn’t argue—the girl was outclassed. She\
  \ tried some sort of spinning backhand, but her opponent ducked easily and whirled\
  \ around before delivering a series of palm strikes that shone with silver light.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“Moves three and four to Blue.”</p> \n     <p>“Good qi control as well,”\
  \ the merchant observed. </p> \n     <p>“Coating his strikes for extra impact,”\
  \ Lei agreed.</p> \n     <p>The girl leapt in the air to try a kick, but the monk\
  \ brought his silvered fists together, releasing the energy in a ripple that blasted\
  \ upward and caught the initiate in the jaw. Her momentum halted, he sent her reeling\
  \ back with an uppercut. From there, it was simple for him to knock her to the ground\
  \ with a sweeping kick of his own.</p> \n     <p>“Five, six, and seven to Blue.”\
  </p> \n     <p>Rather than pressing the attack on a downed opponent, though, he\
  \ waited. One of those warriors’ codes, no doubt. The initiate’s chest rose and\
  \ fell once, and Lei felt like she could hear it even over the crowd’s roar. </p>\
  \ \n     <p>“He shouldn’t have let her catch her breath,” Lei said, leaning forward\
  \ in her seat.</p> \n     <p>“What’s the harm?”</p> \n     <p>The girl in green\
  \ leapt up, full of energy once more, like she hadn’t just spent the last minute\
  \ knocked about by one of the top fighters on the continent. She swung, and though\
  \ the monk brought his arm up, her fist accelerated mid-hook, snaking around his\
  \ guard like a leaf on the wind. She connected with his jaw, driving him twenty\
  \ paces back, to wild cheers.</p> \n     <p>“You said some school in Indapatta?\
  \ That uniform’s the Academy of Golden Arms, and that’s their signature technique—\
  cycling their breath through their organs to generate elemental energy. Air brings…\
  \ speed and flexibility, I believe.” Lei suppressed a smile. “You’re probably too\
  \ young to remember the last time there was Golden Arm in the tournament.”</p> \n\
  \     <p>“After seven moves in Blue’s favor, one to Green.”</p> \n     <p>The monk\
  \ had regained his footing, but the other warrior raised her fist and wind spiraled.\
  \ Another exhalation brought an eruption of lightning, crackling and splitting into\
  \ four strands that shot in each cardinal direction. The electricity speared toward\
  \ the audience, but it crashed against transparent walls of power cast by the Grand\
  \ Judge herself, Hao Jin. The audience gasped, and for one great moment, tens of\
  \ thousands in the Grand Arena—young and old, from all across Golarion, many not\
  \ even sharing a language—were united as their attention hung in this one moment.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>This… <em>this</em> was why Lei loved the Ruby Phoenix Tournament. Not\
  \ for the fights, not for the fun, not even for the business it brought her little\
  \ food cart. This.</p> \n     <p>The lightning spears converged into a single great\
  \ lance pointed at the monk, who crossed his bracers and met the attack valiantly.\
  \ Sparks splashed about him, and the glow around his wrists betrayed that his focus\
  \ was now solely on defense. The blast pushed him back even as he defended, and\
  \ his foot slipped ever so slightly on the sand. His center of balance tipped.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“Two to Green.” The merchant wiped his brow.</p> \n     <p>As the storm\
  \ abated and the monk moved to correct his footing and resume his attack, his opponent\
  \ snapped her hand back with a gasp of power. A pulse, and the monk’s arms—or rather,\
  \ his bracers—jerked toward her, and with no grounded stance, there was precious\
  \ little to stop him from flying forward. </p> \n     <p>“Our initiate’s lightning\
  \ technique has magnetized the bracers on our silent, handsomely chiseled fighter,\
  \ and she’s drawing him closer at extreme speed!” the announcer blathered. “I wonder\
  \ if she’ll teach me that in time for ballroom season!”</p> \n     <p>The girl planted\
  \ her feet, twisted her hips, and drove her fist forward with all her might, delivering\
  \ a single punch to the monk’s sternum as he flew into her at breakneck speed.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The match was over.</p> \n     <p>“Seven moves at Blue’s advantage,\
  \ followed by victory in three consecutive by Green. The baker has it.” The magistrate’\
  s fingers moved on an imaginary abacus before he swiftly divided out all but a tiny\
  \ portion of the coins and passed them to Lei. The merchant stared slack-jawed.\
  \ Lei opened her basket, and seeing there was only one bun left, she put it in the\
  \ merchant’s mouth before scooping his money in—it was the least she could do.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>She turned out of the arena. She’d close up a bit early today, and tomorrow,\
  \ she and her daughter would take the day off to catch some matches from a proper\
  \ arena seat. </p> \n     <p>Now, to see about that hotel room, the one with the\
  \ balcony bath.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p style=\"font-weight: bold; line-height:\
