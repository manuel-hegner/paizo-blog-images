  \  </div> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Characters living\
  \ in the Age of Lost Omens have the unique benefit of being able to speak directly\
  \ with their gods and have these gods directly influence the world around them.\
  \ This is especially true of player characters, who typically have a direct line\
  \ to their given gods, particularly in the case of faithful classes like champions\
  \ and clerics. You can think of <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq021wf?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Gods-Magic\"\
  ><i>Lost Omens Gods &amp; Magic</i></a> as a catalog to help you decide not only\
  \ what faith your character can follow, but also what benefits you gain for said\
  \ worship.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/011020_erastilworshipper.jpg\"\

  \      <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Art by Michele Esposite</p> \n     </div> \n\
  \     <p>The most obvious benefit is new options for your character. Gods &amp;\
  \ Magic has new domains, equipment, feats, and spells for all faithful types, but\
  \ we wanted to make sure that these options were not simply limited to characters\
  \ who were champions and clerics. Faith is important to all manner of character\
  \ in Golarion, whether you are a barbarian praying to Gorum for strength or an investigator\
  \ praying to Zohls for guidance on the latest case. As a result, many of the options\
  \ contained in the book are available to all classes and are meant to encourage\
  \ players to play up the faithful sides of their characters. A great starting point\
  \ for these options is with the new background featured in the book. </p> \n   \

  \ alt=\"Whether in a monastery, a religious household, or just as part of your everyday\
  \ life, your upbringing was steeped in the traditions of a faith or philosophy.\
  \ You might remain committed or you may have turned from your childhood creed, but\
  \ your skills are still founded in your devotion.\r\nChoose two ability boosts.\
  \ One boost must be to an ability specified in the Divine Ability entry for your\
  \ deity, and one is a free ability boost.\r\nYou’re trained in your deity’s associated\
  \ skill, and you gain Assurance with that skill. You gain a Lore skill with a subcategory\
  \ associated with your deity (Abadar Lore, for instance).\"></a> \n      <p style=\"\

  \ background ties into your deity’s Divine Ability, a selection of two different\
  \ ability scores that best represents your faith. Abadar, for example, has Constitution\
  \ and Intelligence listed as his Divine Ability while Zon-Kuthon has Constitution\
  \ or Wisdom. Every deity in the book features a Divine Ability, allowing this background\
  \ to function with any deity necessary for your character concept. </p> \n     <div\

  \ we also present several feats. Most of these feats are available to all characters,\
  \ allowing any faithful to gain benefits from their devout worship. As a note, some\
  \ of these feats are restricted to particular faiths, such as the Sanctify Water\
  \ feat that only functions for followers of a good or evil deity as it allows you\
  \ to create <i>holy water</i> or <i>unholy water</i> respectively. Other feats are\
  \ tied to specific classes, like Sacred Ki which allows monks to convert the damage\
  \ from their ki blast into an alignment that matches that of their deity. One particular\
  \ favorite of mine is Battle Prayer, which allows you to blast a foe with the power\
  \ of scripture!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/011020_battleprayer_500.png\"\

  \ as this book is titled <i>Gods &amp; Magic</i>, one would assume that there is\
  \ plenty of magic. Oh, boy, is there! This book features 14 pages of new spells\
  \ and focus spells. Again, as we didn’t want to lock these spells to only characters\
  \ with domains, a large portion of these spells are part of the arcane, occult,\
  \ or primal traditions, making them perfect additions to your bard’s repertoire\
  \ or your wizard’s spell book. Some of these spells include old classics that have\
  \ been updated for Second Edition like <i>anticipate peril, ill omen, shifting sand</i>,\
  \ and of course, <i>cup of dust</i>!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\

  \ for 1 hour.\r\nSuccess The creature is fatigued for 1 round.\r\nFailure The creature\
  \ is immediately afflicted by thirst as if it hadn’t had a drink in days. It becomes\
  \ fatigued and takes 1d4 damage each hour that can’t be healed until it quenches\
  \ its thirst. No amount of drinking can quench the creature’s thirst during the\
  \ spell’s duration.\r\nCritical Failure As failure but the creature takes 2d4 damage\
  \ each hour, twice as much as usual for thirst.\r\nHeightened (+3) The thirst becomes\

  \ failure.\"></a> \n      <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Cup of Dust</p> \n     </div>\
  \ \n     <p>Although these spells aren’t part of the divine tradition, it doesn’\
  t mean that clerics are out of luck when it comes to these spells. Many of these\
  \ new spells are on the list of cleric spells granted by a deity, allowing worshippers\
  \ of the correct god to gain these new spells, too! Are you sad that you missed\
  \ out on <i>time beacon</i>, the cool new spell that allows you to turn back the\
  \ clock and undo negative effects on you? Worry not! Just follow Shyka the Many\
  \ or… erm… Yog-Sothoth and you can have this cool spell, too!</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  \     <p>Magic takes many forms. For clerics, a significant portion of their magic\
  \ is in the form of domains. Gods &amp; Magic features 18 new domains that run the\
  \ gamut of different concepts and themes. The Dust domain, for example, calls upon\
  \ the power of the gods to dry and crumble what opposes you, allowing you call swirling\
  \ dust with the dust storm spell. The void domain, on the other hand, lets you rend\
  \ reality and create a rift that pulls creatures toward it with door to beyond.\
  \ These new domains also cover general concepts that we didn’t have a chance to\
  \ include in the Core Rulebook like the cold domain.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ be removed with an Interact action, which causes it to melt harmlessly without\

  \ \n     </div> \n     <p>Finally, let’s take a look at some of the cool equipment\
  \ featured in this book. Most of the deities featured in <i>Gods &amp; Magic</i>\
  \ are ones that are being updated to Pathfinder Second Edition. Where we could,\
  \ we tried to make sure these deities are exactly the same as they were originally,\
  \ only swapping out things like the strength domain for the might domain where necessary.\
  \ As a result, we needed to update a good number of favored weapons or even create\
  \ brand new favored weapons for the new deities premiering in this book.</p> \n\

  \ \n     </div> \n     <p>These weapons range from classics like bladed scarf, fighting\
  \ fan, and khopesh to brand new weapons like the polytool, a metal rod with several\
  \ tools folded inside. The polytool is the favored weapon of Casandalee and her\
  \ faithful, allowing her followers to always have whatever tool they need for a\
  \ given task, be it crafting or fighting enemies. In addition to these new weapons,\
  \ we also provide a number of new magic items, each with ties to a particular faith.\
  \ These include the <i>bottomless stein</i>, a stein for Cayden’s faithful that\
  \ never runs empty, the <i>dagger of eternal sleep</i>, a dagger used by Achaekek’\
  s followers that automatically critically hits a sleeping target, and Urgathoa’\
  s <i>dreadsmoke thurible</i>.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\
