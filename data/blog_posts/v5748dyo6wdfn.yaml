  \     </div>\n     <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\">“Auntie, below\
  \ you!” Nahoa’s spear crackled, lightning scouring its barbs free of blood and gristle\
  \ as he pulled it from a spined skull. The boat rocked under his feet as the creature\
  \ spasmed and slid below the waves.</p>\n      <p>Samo shifted her feet in response\
  \ to Nahoa’s warning. The spirits of Valmdas Bay, each a tiny wrasse made of water,\
  \ responded so quickly that it was almost like they’d predicted her signal, and\
  \ in a spray of mist, they carried her across the seafoam. A second set of needle-sharp\
  \ jaws erupted right where Samo had been, but they caught only water.</p>\n    \
  \  <p>Nahoa sighed in relief. He’d seen the wise practitioner rend undead under\
  \ blades of light and convince the very earth to spit its burning blood forth, but\
  \ Nahoa had been taught to always take care of his elders. It was why he’d insisted\
  \ they splurge on a boat across the bay instead of hiking the long way around—less\
  \ to save time, more to make sure that the ferryman and his grandson would be safe\
  \ in these monster-infested waters. Nahoa looked down to check on them, only to\
  \ find the pair clearly in their element, the old man with a hand on the tiller\
  \ and the boy bailing water from the boat.</p>\n      <p>As he turned back to the\
  \ ocean, Nahoa found himself facing the sea serpent’s maw. <em>Oh.</em> His next\
  \ thought was of how beautiful the clouds looked, his body turned skyward as he\
  \ skipped across the water in the wake of the serpent’s blow before he crashed into\
  \ a rocky outcropping. Nahoa’s head reeled a bit from the impact… no, not the impact.\
  \ Nahoa looked at where the beast’s fangs had sunk into his shoulder, and even through\
  \ his tattoos, he could see his veins begin to darken with venom.</p>\n      <p>Nahoa\
  \ wasn’t worried. He’d been wounded before, by something much greater than this,\
  \ and he’d left the encounter not just with his life, but something more. He reached\
  \ deep into his soul, drawing forth his spark of divine power, and pushed it into\
  \ his body, the scar on his chest beginning to glow with light. <em>That</em> had\
  \ been a wound, one that would stay with him forever—this was barely a scratch by\
  \ comparison. The scar blazed, and as light rippled outward from it across Nahoa’\
  s skin, his wounds closed, without even a break in his tattoos where the fangs had\
  \ been.</p>\n      <p>In the distance, the sea serpent reared its head back to strike\
  \ at the boat. Samo danced in the air, her magic growing into roots and vines to\
  \ pull the boy to safety. The old ferryman was left on the boat, though, and Samo\
  \ wouldn’t be able to reach him in time.</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n\

  \      </div>\n      <br>\n      <p>The spark pulsed as its energy coursed over\
  \ Nahoa before coming to illuminate the eyes in the stone owl mask at his waist.\
  \ <em>Be brave</em> it said, pulling the young man forward. The waves between him\
  \ and the serpent were too broad to cross, but he crossed them anyway. The serpent\
  \ was too large for him to possibly grab, but he grabbed it anyway, his belt filling\
  \ his body with divine strength as he wrestled the beast away from the ferryman.\
  \ Was this how it felt, to be above mortal concerns? Like all you needed to do to\
  \ cut an enemy down or to be where you wanted to be was simply to will it, to simply\
  \ <em>make it happen</em> and have it be done? Nahoa flung the serpent back into\
  \ the water as Samo’s vines pulled the ferryman to safety. Then, the moment of transcendence\
  \ passed, and Nahoa was mortal once again.</p>\n      <p>The waters went still.\
  \ Nahoa flipped his spear underhand and watched the waves. A spine cut the surface\
  \ and Nahoa lashed out, but the serpent dove below before he could pierce it. A\
  \ tail emerged on the other side of the boat, and once again Nahoa’s arm was too\
  \ slow. Coils began to surround it from below the water, out of reach, and without\
  \ the steady hand of the ferryman, the boat lurched dangerously.</p>\n      <p>Samo\
  \ approached to lend aid, but Nahoa extended a hand as he dropped his spear. If\
  \ he couldn’t find the creature, he’d just make sure he didn’t have to. He drew\
  \ his power inwards, back from his relics, and there was silence. Like the tide\
  \ drawing out far enough to leave the corals exposed, before the wave crashed down.\
  \ Like the tradewinds driving up the mountain cliffs, before the rains fell. Like\
  \ a voice grew quiet, before it let loose a great confession. Nahoa’s power grew\
  \ and grew as it spiraled within him. He had seized that spark of gods high in the\
  \ sky, and in this moment, the sky would bend to his command.</p>\n      <p>Nahoa\
  \ laughed as he spun his arms, and his cry echoed like thunder as the sky opened.\
  \ To the north, spring lightning seared the sky. To the east, summer monsoons churned\
  \ the water’s surface. To the south, red leaves sliced in melancholy. And to the\
  \ west, hail drove deep into the water. Then, Nahoa’s laugh and the storm’s howl\
  \ faded, and a moment later, the serpent’s body floated to the surface, each section\
  \ bearing different wounds.</p>\n      <p>Samo returned to the boat, the ferryman\
  \ and his grandson in tow. As the sage returned, Nahoa had only one question for\
  \ his traveling companion. He pointed to the water, where a few hailstones still\
  \ floated on the surface.</p>\n      <p>“What are those?”</p>\n     </blockquote>\n\
