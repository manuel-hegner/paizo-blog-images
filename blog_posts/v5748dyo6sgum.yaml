  \     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Iseph crept through the empty\
  \ museum, footsteps soundless on the tiled floor. All around the android, monsters\
  \ loomed—alien creatures propped up in glass-walled display cases, their exhibits\
  \ pumped full of inert gas to prevent the corpses' decay. In the dim emergency lighting,\
  \ some of them almost looked alive. But of course that wasn't how places like this\
  \ worked. </p> \n      <p> Iseph paused at the entrance to their destination. Pulling\
  \ the tube from their belt, they blew a soft puff of dust through the doorway. </p>\
  \ \n      <p> Laser lit up red, crisscrossing the small room. Iseph made a mental\
  \ map of their locations, burning them into short-term memory even as the dust drifted\
  \ to the floor and they disappeared again. </p> \n      <p> Bending low, Iseph slithered\
  \ beneath the first laser, then arched high over the second. Of course, the android's\
  \ cloaking field could bend lasers without breaking them, the same way it was currently\
  \ foiling the thermal imaging cameras, and would have beaten the visual spectrum\
  \ cameras if Iseph hadn't already hacked them to loop the footage. But Iseph had\
  \ a certain level of professional pride, and laser tripwires were novice stuff—\
  the sort of thing you put in because it looked impressive to clients, not because\
  \ it deterred professionals. Dancing around them was so easy it was almost insulting.\
  \ But of course the museum's security couldn't have known whom they'd be dealing\
  \ with. </p> \n      <div style=\"font-size: 13px;\r\n    float: left;\r\n    text-align:\

  \ alt=\"Iseph stands in a darkened museum surrounded by priceless items in glass\
  \ cases. Before him is a pedestal with a glowing crystal. He holds the case's cover\
  \ in his left hand and reaches for the crystal with his right. \"></a>\n       <br>\
  \ Illustration by Alberto Dal Lago\n      </div> \n      <p> The crystal stood alone\
  \ atop a display pedestal, glowing softly. Inside its cylindrical viewing case,\
  \ it balanced incongruously on a single metal point, its lower half an elaborate\
  \ setting of wires and circuitry. </p> \n      <p> Rerouting the arcano-electric\
  \ security seal on the case itself was more of a challenge, but still too easy for\
  \ someone of Iseph's skill. The android added the appropriate relays, synched them,\
  \ and popped the case free. </p> \n      <p> With nothing left between Iseph and\
  \ the crystal, the android considered the pedestal's pressure sensor. It was a classic\
  \ mechanism—the sort of thing you saw everywhere from ancient temples to modern\
  \ bank vaults—yet still remarkably difficult to deal with. The era when you could\
  \ just swap in a similarly sized rock as you snatched away the treasure was long\
  \ gone, if it had ever truly existed. </p> \n      <p> Iseph knew the right tool\
  \ for the job—a specialized lifter-and-pump mechanism that you anchored outside\
  \ the pressure sensor, then attached to your target. The pump drew up liquid from\
  \ a reservoir in the anchor, inflating a sack atop the sensor at the exact same\
  \ rate as the crane arm lifted the prize free, making sure the weight remained constant.\
  \ But it was expensive, and by necessity single-use. Iseph couldn't be expected\
  \ to have one on hand. </p> \n      <p> It was a perfectly reasonable test to fail,\
  \ yet something about it stuck in Iseph's craw. It was just so pedestrian. If— </p>\
  \ \n      <p> A glint at the crystal's base caught their eye. There—a single metal\
  \ flake, its color slightly off from its surroundings. </p> \n      <p> Iseph smiled.\
  \ A magnetic proximity alarm. Electromagnetic sensors inside the pedestal would\
  \ be calibrated to the alloy of that tag, sensing its exact composition and distance.\
  \ Move it, and you'd disrupt the invisible magnetic fields and trigger the alarm.\
  \ </p> \n      <p> And Iseph almost hadn't seen it. Here, at last, was some quality\
  \ security work. Getting past it would require time and finesse. </p> \n      <p>\
  \ Iseph snatched the crystal off its pedestal. </p> \n      <p> Alarms blared, accompanied\
  \ by the clangs of security gates slamming down across exits throughout the museum.\
  \ Iseph dropped their cloaking field, briefly considered waving to the thermal cameras,\
  \ then sprinted back through the exhibits. </p> \n      <p> Security guards came\
  \ rushing through the main entrance just as Iseph neared it—two humans, a ysoki,\
  \ and a full half-dozen humanoid security bots, all positioned between the android\
  \ and the exit. They didn't even give a warning, just opened fire with arc emitters\
  \ and pulsecasters, the air humming and crackling with electricity. </p> \n    \
  \  <p> Well, that isn't very professional. Iseph dove for shelter behind an exhibit\
  \ featuring some sort of star-nosed lizard. The android drew their own pistol and\
  \ leaned out to return fire, winging one of the humans. </p> \n      <p> It was\
  \ tempting to keep firing—to show them all just who they were dealing with. But\
  \ nine was probably too many, even for Iseph, and besides, the android had promised:\
  \ only enough combat to sell it. Which meant it was time for the hard part. </p>\
  \ \n      <p> This is going to hurt. Wincing in anticipation, Iseph slipped the\
  \ crystal into an armored pouch, then stood and darted around the corner, straight\
  \ for one of the patrol bots. </p> \n      <p> The blast caught Iseph full in the\
  \ chest, sending them sprawling as electricity overloaded circuits and set muscles\
  \ twitching. Someone kicked the gun from Iseph's hand, and then the android was\
  \ staring up at a circle of angry faces and mirrored robotic lenses. </p> \n   \
  \   <p> The human Iseph had shot clutched at his injured shoulder. “An android?”\
  \ he snarled. “I'd have thought one of you half-bots would be too smart to try stealing\
  \ from the Galactic Heritage Foundation.” He patted Iseph down roughly, eyebrows\
  \ rising as he pulled the crystal from its case. “The Songstone! You've got a good\
  \ eye, for a thief.” </p> \n      <p> “I'm not the thief here.” Iseph pointed at\
  \ the Songstone. “That crystal stores the psychic memories of the Parelnesi tribes\
  \ going back a thousand generations—their whole culture is in there! It doesn't\
  \ belong in a museum.” </p> \n      <p> “That's exactly why it belongs in a museum,”\
  \ the guard snapped. “That kind of history is too valuable to leave on some backwater\
  \ world. Besides, they obviously couldn't protect it.” </p> \n      <p> “No,” Iseph\
  \ acknowledged with a nod. “But they could hire somebody to get it back.” </p> \n\
  \      <p> The guard smirked. “And look how well that went.” </p> \n      <p> Iseph\
  \ matched his smile. “I don't know, I think it's going pretty well.” </p> \n   \
  \   <p> The ysoki guard wrinkled her snout. “How do you figure?” </p> \n      <p>\
  \ As if on cue, the six security bots swiveled in unison, pointing their weapons\
  \ at the guards. </p> \n      <p> Over the museum's intercom, a familiar voice said,\
  \ “Weapons down, please.” </p> \n      <p> “What?” The lead guard gaped, pistol\
  \ hanging loose as he stared down the barrels of his robots' arc emitters. </p>\
  \ \n      <p> “You didn't really think I tripped your alarm by accident, did you?”\
  \ Iseph stood, shaking out the last pins and needles of the stun bolt. The android\
  \ reached out and plucked the crystal from the guard's grip. “I just needed to lure\
  \ you all away from the security station long enough for the others to get in there\
  \ and work their magic.” </p> \n      <p> The intercom clicked on once more, ringing\
  \ with Raia's smooth tones. </p> \n      <p> “The museum is now closed,” she announced.\
  \ “All jewel thieves, please proceed to the nearest exit...” </p> \n      <div style=\"\
