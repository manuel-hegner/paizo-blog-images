  \ <blockquote> \n    <h1><br>Powerful Words</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Tuesday,\
  \ May 17, 2011</p> \n    <p>It is just about here. The newest addition to the Pathfinder\
  \ RPG line releases this week and you should be able to find <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy8g7s\"\
  ><i>Ultimate Magic</i></a> online or at your local game store any day now. For our\
  \ final look into this mighty tome of magic, we are going to look at the Words of\
  \ Power chapter.</p> \n    <p>Words of power is an alternative system of spellcasting\
  \ that allows the wordcaster to create spells using any of the words that he knows.\
  \ While these spells still consume specific slots, what goes in each slot each day\
  \ depends entirely upon what words the wordscaster knows and how he wants to combine\
  \ them.</p> \n    <p>This system went through significant revision throughout the\
  \ playtesting process. Originally, the system was based on points, with each word\
  \ added to a spell costing a set amount. A wordcaster could add nearly any number\
  \ of words so long as the spell slot in question had enough points to pay for them.\
  \ While this was supremely flexible, most found the point tracking to be too cumbersome\
  \ and prone to abuse. The new system allows a wordcaster to add one effect word\
  \ of a level equal to the spell slot used, or multiple words of a lower level. In\
  \ addition, each spell can have one of a number of different target words (which\
  \ are not counted against the total number of words in the spell) and they can include\
  \ one or more meta words (which add power and flexibility to the spell). This means\
  \ that most spells can be built quite easily if that is what the caster wants (which\
  \ is certainly the case on the GMs side of the screen), but each can also be carefully\
  \ crafted out of multiple words to create interesting and unique effects. Take the\
  \ following effect words for example.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><b>Accelerate\
  \ (Time)</b><br> <b>School</b> transmutation; <b>Level</b> alchemist 2, bard 2,\
  \ magus 2, sorcerer/wizard 2, summoner 2<br> <b>Duration</b> 1 round/level<br> <b>Saving\
  \ Throw</b> Will negates (harmless); <b>Spell Resistance</b> yes (harmless)<br>\
  \ <b>Target Restrictions</b> selected<br> The target of a wordspell with this effect\
  \ word can take one additional move action each turn. This move action can come\
  \ before, after, or between other actions, but not during a full-round action.<br>\
  \ <b>Boost</b>: If the target takes a full-attack action, it can, instead of taking\
  \ an extra move action, make one additional attack at its highest attack bonus.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>Perfect Form (Body)</b><br> <b>School</b> transmutation; <b>Level</b>\
  \ alchemist 4, bard 4, cleric 4, druid 4, magus 4, sorcerer/wizard 4, summoner 4<br>\
  \ <b>Duration</b> 1 round/level<br> <b>Saving Throw</b> Will negates (harmless);\
  \ <b>Spell Resistance</b> yes (harmless)<br> <b>Target Restriction</b> personal,\
  \ selected<br> The target of a wordspell with this effect word receives a +4 enhancement\
  \ to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p><i>Accelerate</i>\
  \ is a simple enough word, granting its target an additional move action. <i>Perfect\
  \ form</i> is also relatively straight-forward, granting a +4 bonus to physical\
  \ ability scores. One of the great things about this system is that the two could\
  \ be combined by any class capable of casting both into one 5th-level wordspell\
  \ that enacts both effects simultaneously.</p> \n    <p>Things get really interesting\
  \ with the addition of meta words. These words allow a spellcaster to access even\
  \ greater powers without, necessarily, using up a higher spell slot. For example,\
  \ the <i>boost</i> meta words can be used with the <i>accelerate</i> word to grant\
  \ an extra attack instead of a move action. Boosting the selected target word allows\
  \ a wordspell to affect more than one target, but this has the side effect of increasing\
  \ the level of spell by three levels. While meta words add a great deal of flexibility\
  \ to how a wordcaster uses his magic, there is a limit to the number of meta words\
  \ a wordcaster can use per day. Take a look at this powerful meta word.</p> \n \
  \   <blockquote> \n     <p><b>Irresistible</b><br> <b>Level</b> 5<br> Targets of\
  \ a wordspell with this meta word must roll their saving throws twice and take the\
  \ worse result. This meta word increases the level of all the effect words in the\
  \ wordspell that allow a saving throw by two levels.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n\
  \    <p>As you can see, there are a great deal of possibilities with the words of\
  \ power system, especially with over 120 effect words at your disposal. And with\
  \ that, we wrap up our look at <i>Ultimate Magic</i>. We hope you use it to add\
  \ a bit of magic to your game. In the coming months, expect to hear a lot about\
  \ the companion to this book, <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy8ies\"><i>Ultimate Combat</i></a>,\
  \ due out in August. Until then.</p> \n    <p>Jason Bulmahn <br>Lead Designer</p>\
