  \ &amp; 28</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Thursday, February 12, 2009</p> \n   <p>Hello\
  \ and welcome to another installment of the Pathfinder Society Scenario Open Call.\
  \ Last week I selected the authors for scenarios #23 and #24 and they are, respectively:\
  \ Steven Robert (<i>Tide of Morning</i>) and Tim Hitchcock (<i>The Decline of Glory</i>).\
  \ Congratulations, guys!</p> \n   <p>That brings us to the open call round for #27\
  \ and #28 (#25 and #26 were assigned). This month's open call is the last open call\
  \ for OGL 3.5 and the last open call until September. I'll repeat that: this is\
  \ the last open call until September. So if you're waiting to get involved or submit,\
  \ this is your last chance for a while. With the launch of the Pathfinder Roleplaying\
  \ Game and the fact that we have to start writing scenarios with the new rules in\
  \ the next few months, we've decided to assign the first PRPG scenarios to current\
  \ scenario authors who could include those authors selected to write #27 and #28.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>As always, keep the following guidelines in mind when submitting:</p>\
  \ \n   <blockquote> \n    <p>1. Don't break our world. If you submit something that\
  \ breaks part of our world, it'll be auto-rejected. The scenarios are one-shot,\
  \ 4-hour adventures—epic story arcs, world-shattering events, wars, mass famine,\
  \ etc. don't have a place in them.</p> \n    <p>2. Understand Pathfinder Society\
  \ Organized Play before you submit. Specifically, understand that the Pathfinder\
  \ Society is an organization of vagabond scholars, thrill-seeking treasure hunters,\
  \ and extreme explorers. They are not necessarily the \"good guys,\" they don't\
  \ get \"hired\" for their adventures, and they're not generally looking to make\
  \ the world a better place. Submitting generic 3.5 \"save the day\" adventure ideas\
  \ will decrease your chances of getting to write one. There are plenty of resources\
  \ out there to give you a feel for the Society: the <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/scenarios/v5748btpy84k4\"\
  >Guide to Pathfinder Society Organized Play</a>, <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/riseOfTheRunelords/v5748btpy7zkr\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Adventure Path</i> volume #1</a>, and the <a href=\"/store/downloads/pathfinder/pathfinderChronicles/v5748btpy84eo\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Chronicles Campaign Setting</i></a> all have information on the Pathfinder\
  \ Society. </p> \n    <p>3. I need to feel that you've read or played a few scenarios\
  \ before submitting. I'll get this sense through your proposal—our scenarios have\
  \ a very specific flow to them and your outline should follow this flow. Read one\
  \ or two before submitting.</p> \n    <p>4. Pathfinder Society Scenarios must be\
  \ no more offensive than PG-13. Scenarios are played in public at public settings\
  \ and children will be playing them. No more submissions that include violence toward\
  \ children, please.</p> \n    <p>5. This is not a contest. This is more like an\
  \ interview for a job—you're showing me your best idea and I'm deciding if the combination\
  \ of idea and writing skill equals you being selected as our next scenario author.\
  \ I need authors—not winners. And I really want to stress the <i>author</i> part\
  \ of that. Only send me your best work that is reflective of your writing style.\
  \ I can teach someone the rules system—I can't teach someone to write.</p> \n  \
  \  <p>6. I just don't have time to return every submission with feedback. Feel free\
  \ to post your rejected proposals to the Pathfinder Society messageboards for peer\
  \ review. For those of you not submitting, please give feedback to those who do\
  \ and are rejected. </p> \n    <p>7. Lastly, I posted some general feedback on recent\
  \ submissions <a href=\"/paizo/messageboards/paizoPublishing/pathfinder/pathfinderSociety/scenarioSubmissionTalk/scenarioSubmissionAdvice\"\
  >here</a>. Please read that thread before submitting. It'll help. I promise.</p>\
  \ \n   </blockquote> \n   <p>Rules for submitting Pathfinder Society Scenario outlines\
  \ are as follows:</p> \n   <blockquote> \n    <p>1. Based on the guidelines for\
  \ the current round, write a 750-word outline that includes the following:</p> \n\
  \    <blockquote> \n     <p>a. A title<br> b. A brief introduction that acts as\
  \ a prologue for the scenario<br> c. A brief summary of how the PCs proceed through\
  \ each encounter<br> d. A brief summary of each encounter—minimum five encounters<br>\
  \ e. A brief conclusion—what happens if the PCs fail or succeed<br> f. You <b>no\
  \ longer</b> need to submit mission ideas with your outline</p> \n    </blockquote>\
  \ \n    <p>2. By the due date, email your outline to <a href=\"mailto:josh@paizo.com?subject=SCENARIO%20NAME_##_YOURLASTNAME\"\
  >josh@paizo.com</a> with the subject line <b>SCENARIO NAME_SCENARIO#_YOURLASTNAME</b>.\
  \ Your summary must be in a MS Word document, Notepad, or Real Text format—these\
  \ are files ending in <b>.doc</b>, <b>.txt</b>, or <b>.rtf</b>. Your file must be\
  \ titled SCENARIO NAME_SCENARIO#_LAST NAME, i.e., PerilsofthePiratePact_17_Dayon.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>3. Include your full legal name, email address, physical mailing address,\
  \ and a contact phone number at the top of your submission—this text does <i>not</i>\
  \ count toward your word count. </p> \n    <p>4. Please allow 72 hours for a response\
  \ before resending your submission. </p> \n    <p>The current open call is for Pathfinder\
  \ Society scenarios 27 &amp; 28—the July releases and last OGL 3.5 scenarios. The\
  \ full schedule for this submission period is as follows:</p> \n    <blockquote>\
  \ \n     <p>• 2/12/09—Open call begins<br> • 2/20/09—Submissions due by 11:59 P.M.\
  \ Pacific Time<br> • 3/6/09—Submissions review completed—selections and rejections\
  \ notified</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p><b>Guidelines</b></p> \n    <p>**<b>SPOILER\
  \ ALERT: Do not read the guidelines below if you wish to avoid spoilers for upcoming\
  \ scenarios.</b>**</p> \n    <p><b>Pathfinder Society Scenario #27</b><br> Suggested\
  \ Title: <i>Our Lady of Silver</i><br> Setting: Qadiran City (political intrigue\
  \ scenario that pits wealthy merchant lords against one another)<br> Monster: Open<br>\
  \ Level Range: Tier 5–9; tiers 5–6 and 8–9</p> \n    <p><b>Pathfinder Society Scenario\
  \ #28</b><br> Suggested Title: <i>Lyrics of Extinction</i><br> Setting: Mwangi Expanse\
  \ (ancient culture destroyed by fell song—travel to the ruins to recover a copy\
  \ of it)<br> Monster: Open<br> Level Range: Tier 7–11; tiers 7–8 and 10–11</p> \n\
  \    <p>PLEASE NOTE: Pathfinder Society Scenarios are written with a 4-hour time\
  \ limit in mind. Your outline should reflect 4 hours of solid game play.</p> \n\
