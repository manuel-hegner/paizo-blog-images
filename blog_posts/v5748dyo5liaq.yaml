  half vampire, half human. In the gritty streets and haunted peaks of Ustalav, she's\
  \ an agent for the royal spymaster, keeping peace between the capital's secret vampire\
  \ population and its huddled human masses. Meanwhile, in the cathedral of Maiden's\
  \ Choir, Jadain is a young priestess of the death goddess, in trouble with her superiors\
  \ for being too soft on the living. When a noblewoman's entire house is massacred\
  \ by vampiric invaders, the unlikely pair is drawn into a deadly mystery that will\
  \ reveal far more about both of them than they ever wanted to know....</i></p> \n\
  \     <blockquote> \n      <h2>Chapter One: Deserving Victims<br> <i>Larsa</i></h2>\
  \ \n      <p>Both were victims.</p> \n      <p>She ground against him, forcing hips\
  \ away from the soot-smeared stone of the alley wall, hands grasping, mouth gnawing.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>His breath came as a gasp but left as a growl. Hands struggled with\
  \ her dress's collar. Hairy fingers dug in her skin.</p> \n      <p>Had I been a\
  \ passerby, glimpsing them sidelong from the street, I might have been envious.\
  \ Even knowing what they were, some voyeuristic urge stopped me on the slick shingle\
  \ overlook. The appeal of hard and soft flesh aside, I wondered which of the pair\
  \ was more the monster.</p> \n      <p>Clothes fell away, hardly barriers at all,\
  \ the straps of her provocatively innocent dress following his tailored coat. Peasant\
  \ cloth dangled from her waist, skin milky in the alley's slats of mist-webbed moonlight.\
  \ He barely spared a hungry glance before diving back to her kisses, a coarse hand\
  \ pinning her shoulder to the bare brick. Her own light touch played him like the\
  \ moist rim of a wine glass, the results just as audible.</p> \n      <p>I couldn't\
  \ hear their words, but the timbre of their murmurs gave away a predictable script.\
  \ Gravelly whispers threatened pleasures. Feigned naivete filled her response with\
  \ blushes. His hand slipped behind him, reaching for the grips of the tool jammed\
  \ in the back of his belt, no longer hidden under his big coat. The steel of workman's\
  \ shears scored the gloom—shears that had, in preceding weeks, pruned at least four\
  \ similar alley flowers. Her&nbsp;slitted eyes didn't see, her head falling back\
  \ under an assault of bruising kisses. The blades came up.</p> \n      <p>Here it\
  \ was.</p> \n      <p>Like a whip crack, the motion was too fast even to blur. With\
  \ a snip and splash the shears clattered to the boggy cobbles.</p> \n      <p>There\
  \ was no pleasure in his second gasp. </p> \n      <p>Pale arms that had strained\
  \ to enfold him a moment earlier now bit into his skin like viciously pulled reins.\
  \ Her kiss on his neck was deeper now, sharper and hungrier. He struggled, but only\
  \ now, with jaws at his neck, did he realize that he wasn't the predator.</p> \n\
  \      <p>A shame. I'd hoped she'd be the one surprised. Few humans could match\
  \ her experience, though—she'd likely been hunting in the city for decades. She\
  \ might have continued, too, if she played by the rules. Now she'd become a problem.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>My problem.</p> \n      <p>I dropped from my vantage. Heavy with the\
  \ night's cold mist, my cloak slapped the stained cobbles. Her eyes were on me even\
  \ as her mouth worked her lover's neck. Greedy thing, she was more chewing than\
  \ drinking—obviously not of the sort of stock anyone taught manners. I straightened\
  \ and pulled my sword, its silvered length catching a glimmer of moonlight through\
  \ the dull haze.</p> \n      <p>Her eyes locked on mine, watching but obviously\
  \ not considering me enough of a threat to risk losing her meal. The struggling\
  \ in her grip was weakening, the man gradually accepting a warm, lethargic futility—\
  the best part. I closed cautiously.</p> \n      <p>She came up, as if for the air\
  \ she didn't need, gasping lewdly as she did. Sweat and blood trailed from her mouth\
  \ in ribbons. She'd been sloppy, blood coursing down her jaw and chest. Daintily,\
  \ she touched her hand to her lips, stained fangs glistening behind her fingers.\
  \ A practiced pout poured over the shoulder of her current beau. \"You can be next.\"\
  </p> \n      <p>Very sloppy. My blade leapt up, obviously faster than she'd expected.\
  \ A slender white digit arced into the air and plunked into the mud. It didn't bleed.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Her scream was not that of a blushing maid. Shrill with shock, it cracked,\
  \ reaching a pitch like a shrieking hawk. Her lover barreled into me, thrown backward\
  \ as she extracted herself from his embrace. I spun out of the way, surprised to\
  \ hear him grunt as the muddy cobbles met his face.</p> \n      <p>My sword came\
  \ back up for the milkmaid. The alley was empty. My eyes went higher, and so did\
  \ a missile from my belt. The dart sounded like a wasp for the instant it flew,\
  \ jabbing its silver stinger into a blood-drenched neck. She'd leapt up one of the\
  \ alley's crumbling tenement walls—an elementary trick.</p> \n      <p>\"Bitch!\"\
  \ Pain growled through the word. She sprang. I slid back. Even with a belly full\
  \ of blood she was likely faster than I, but I was still quicker than she thought.\
  \ Nails like claws sliced past my face, digging into filthy alley stone. It wasn't\
  \ a jarring miss, though—she landed like a bounding cougar and pounced again.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>My sword was between us, its hilt wrapped with the copper chain of\
  \ an angelic ankh—the holy icon of Sarenrae, goddess of the sun. She skidded and\
  \ reeled, expecting the symbol to flare with divine light. </p> \n      <p>\"You\
  \ are forbidden to hunt in this part of the city.\" I brandished the talisman as\
  \ though I had faith in it. \"Explain yourself.\"</p> \n      <p>\"I have refined\
  \ tastes.\" Even stained and exposed, she postured. \"I hunt where I choose.\"</p>\
  \ \n      <p>\"You hunt where your master allows. You hunt where his truce isn't\
  \ threatened.\"</p> \n      <p>She tittered, again raising a coy hand to her mouth.\
  \ It came back wet. \"I have no master.\"</p> \n      <p>\"Your arrogance threatens\
  \ more than you understand.\"</p> \n      <p>\"You mean we threaten you mortals.\"\
  \ She started to circle me. \"Had that old coward not betrayed his kind with his\
  \ truce, the only humans in this city would be mindless casks, waiting to be drained.\"\
  </p> \n      <p>\"Overestimation is a disease of the lowborn.\"</p> \n      <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8530-Cover.jpg\"\

  \  <br><i>Illustration by Lucas Graciano</i>\n      </div> \n      <p>She sneered.\
  \ \"Your end could have been pleasant, had you the sense not to insult your betters.\"\
  </p> \n      <p> It was my turn to laugh. \"You had to trick a human into an alley.\
  \ He wasn't under your control—he was planning to kill you. Was his mind too difficult\
  \ to overpower? Or perhaps your will was too weak?\"</p> \n      <p>Her eyes smoldered\
  \ in the gloom. \"How dare—\" </p> \n      <p>\"Speaking of control, not even a\
  \ rat has come to your aid. Where are your minions, mistress?\" I produced a match\
  \ and ran my nail across its head, the crisp white flame dramatically lighting her\
  \ snarl. She was ready to pounce.</p> \n      <p>\"But most pitiful,\" I dropped\
  \ the match into the muck between us, \"is that.\" </p> \n      <p>On the ground\
  \ between us lay her dainty, mud-stained digit. </p> \n      <p>\"There's no magic\
  \ in this blade, Your Ladyship. So apparently you're still mortal enough to be cut\
  \ up by our weapons.\" I leveled the sword at her face. \"You're not my better.\
  \ You're hardly even fit to call yourself vampire. You're just some bored immortal's\
  \ stray spawn.\"</p> \n      <p>Baring her fangs and screeching, she rushed me,\
  \ crushing the match underfoot. </p> \n      <p>She wanted me dead. Good. There'd\
  \ be no tricks now. She might not be a true vampire—at least, not as the full-bloods\
  \ would consider it—but she was still deadly enough.</p> \n      <p>She lashed out\
  \ wildly, claws blurring. I kept ahead of her, scoring several nicks across her\
  \ forearms. The bloodless wounds knitted shut with unnatural speed, but her reckless\
  \ rush gave me plenty of opportunities to make more. </p> \n      <p>Her chirping\
  \ laugh echoed off the alley walls as I gave ground. A stroke across her stomach\
  \ killed the noise, the gash deep enough to make her gush blood that wasn't her\
  \ own. With a sound more gurgle than growl, she grabbed the blade as it freed itself\
  \ from her midsection. The silver bit deep into her grasp. I thrust to impale her,\
  \ but the sword didn't budge. Death lent her unnatural strength, and she yanked\
  \ the blade from my hands. It clattered down the alleyway, toward her forgotten\
  \ meal. My emptied hands snapped up, one covering my heart, the other reflexively\
  \ trying to hold her off as she came. She slammed into me, pinning me against the\
  \ wall just as her lover had trapped her moments before. </p> \n      <p>She locked\
  \ her nails around my neck. \"Scream!\"</p> \n      <p>The chill of her hands caused\
  \ my breath to catch. Death, palpable and endless, washed over me, an arctic wave\
  \ seeking to erode my soul. While blood kept vampires fed, the chill of their lifeless\
  \ essence leeched mortal life, freezing a living spirit to death.</p> \n      <p>Fortunately,\
  \ I liked the cold.</p> \n      <p>\"What?\" She blinked, baffled as to why her\
  \ touch wasn't sapping my life. I flashed her a smile, and in that last moment she\
  \ understood. </p> \n      <p>I twisted, pulling a hawthorn stake from my bandolier,\
  \ then lunged. The sharpened wood drove home, her weak, wet skin splitting like\
  \ a reptile egg. A rigidity more appropriate to the deceased seized her body, freezing\
  \ her face in a look of wide-eyed realization. </p> \n      <p> I pushed, and black\
  \ locks trailed her stiff fall. She struck the stone with hardly a thud. The stake\
  \ quivered, but stayed firmly planted through her heart.</p> \n      <p>She wasn't\
  \ dead—or, rather, she wasn't destroyed. The stake would hold her paralyzed and\
  \ unaware so long as it remained in place. A final destruction required a bit more\
  \ effort.</p> \n      <p>At the other end of the alley, I was surprised to find\
  \ the big man weakly struggling to pull himself against a wall, blood oozing between\
  \ thick fingers clasped to his neck. I paid his groans no mind and retrieved my\
  \ blade. </p> \n      <p>Back with my quarry, I performed the necessary field dressing—\
  removing her head. It was a practiced grotesquery, and I hacked through the cold\
  \ meat with a butcher's half attention. A trickle of gore—none of it her own—reminded\
  \ me why I hated doing this right after the creature had fed. Finishing the work,\
  \ I dragged the decapitated corpse to the alley's eastern mouth, propping it against\
  \ a wall sure to be hit by the morning sun. The dawn would reduce the vampire's\
  \ body to ashes, assuring no second resurrection.</p> \n      <p>A whimper drew\
  \ my attention back to the bleeding man. Dropping the vampire's head into the stained\
  \ sack I used for exactly that purpose, I turned back to the would-be murderer.\
  \ </p> \n      <p>Past him, a carriage soundlessly pulled up at the far end of the\
  \ alley.</p> \n      <p>I didn't hold back any of the curses that leapt to mind.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Stiff black clothes held a stiff-backed driver, a human in his late\
  \ fifties who regarded the bodies and incriminating stains with disinterest.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>\"He's expecting you,\" he said in his perpetually bored voice. Despite\
  \ the formality, I knew it was an order.</p> \n      <p>Damn. This was sure to further\
  \ ruin an already perfectly unpleasant night. \"I'm almost done.\"</p> \n      <p>The\
  \ driver's expression didn't so much as twitch, yet I could tell he disapproved.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>To hell with him.</p> \n      <p>I retrieved the bleeding man's heavy\
  \ shears and knelt at his side. He couldn't resist me pulling his hand away, uncovering\
  \ his torn neck. The spawn had been brutal, but he'd survive.</p> \n      <p>He\
  \ let me scrutinize the wound closer, obviously mistaking my intentions. He hardly\
  \ whimpered when my mouth clapped over the deepest wounds, fangs tearing the tortured\
  \ flesh back open. I pressed his arm against the wall and drank fast, draining him\
  \ like I was throwing down a shot. I didn't like sharing from the same flask as\
  \ my quarry, but if the evening was taking the turn I feared, I wouldn't have another\
  \ chance.</p> \n      <p>Anyway, he deserved it.</p> \n     </blockquote> \n   \
