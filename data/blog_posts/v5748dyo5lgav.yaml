  \ Class Guide Preview: Brawler</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, July 15, 2014</p>\
  \ \n    <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n     <p><span itemprop=\"description\"\
  >The monk is a disciplined martial artist who spends years of practice to perfect\
  \ his body and mind. A lawful paragon, the monk has strange and mysterious ki powers.\
  \ But sometimes you don't want to play Bruce Lee. Sometimes you want to be Chuck\
  \ Norris. No rules, no discipline, just a headbutt, a kick in the face, and a sucker\
  \ punch. Bloody, ugly, but effective. If that's what you want, the <a href=\"/products/btpy95d1\"\
  ><i>Advanced Class Guide</i></a> has the class you've been waiting for.</span></p>\
  \ \n     <p>From the very first playtest version, the Brawler has also possessed\
  \ some key features. She had full base attack bonus and rocked the monk's unarmed\
  \ strike damage. She kept all her abilities in light armor (so appropriately, she\
  \ is brutal in brawling armor). And she had a unique key feature all her own, martial\
  \ maneuvers, now with a new name in the final version that better carries the awesomeness\
  \ of the abilityâ€”martial flexibility. Martial flexibility is the brawler's answer\
  \ for the disciplined abilities that the monk learns from all those years of study\
  \ and perfection. With her flexible mind and intuitive grasp of close-quarters combat,\
  \ the brawler has seen pretty much every trick in the book throughout her many bar\
  \ brawls, arena fights, and adventuring combats. Martial flexibility allows her\
  \ to spontaneously gain access to just the right combat feat (or later feats!) for\
  \ her situation. Did someone splash ale in your eyes? Gain Blind-Fight. A spellcaster\
  \ giving you the blues? Try Disruptive and Spellbreaker, maybe with an added dash\
  \ of Step-Up. Giant enemy archer? Just take Deflect Arrows and they can kiss their\
  \ Manyshot goodbye (after which you hit their weak point for massive damage).</p>\

  ></a>\n      <br>Illustration by Ramon Puasa Jr\n     </div> \n     <p>During the\
  \ playtest, we were all out on the forums bringing back our data, which revealed\
  \ a few things. Mainly, we all discovered that martial flexibility was awesome,\
  \ but the brawler could use some more tricks that she could rely on consistently\
  \ and that are unique to her. Have you ever wished you could hit that weakling wizard\
  \ right beneath the jaw in just the right spot to knock him out in one hit? As of\
  \ the second playtest version, the brawler gained the ability to dish out an instant\
  \ knockout blow starting at level 13 with a devastating DC based on the brawler's\
  \ Str or Dex score (your choice!). Furthermore, she gained the ability to use Awesome\
  \ Blow without being size Large, eventually gaining the ability to dropkick the\
  \ tarrasque 10 feet, knocking it prone, despite being size Medium.</p> \n     <p>As\
  \ of the end of the playtest, the brawler was already awesome, and she seemed to\
  \ have found a good place, but there were still a few observations from playtesters\
  \ that led to some tweaks for the final version. First of all, the final brawler\
  \ can deal increased damage with the close weapon group (growing at a slightly reduced\
  \ rate from her unarmed damage), letting her brawl with everything at her disposal.\
  \ Second, the knockout ability appearing at level 13 and then growing to 3 uses\
  \ per day at level 16 seemed rather late and sudden. So the final version? She can\
  \ start her instant knockout attacks at level 4! And just wait until you see the\
  \ frankly mind-boggling feat novas you can pull off with her new capstone!</p> \n\
  \     <p>If standard brawler flavor isn't enough, brawler has some of the most evocative\
  \ archetypes in the book. Instead of using unarmed strikes, the Exemplar can inspire\
  \ allies like a bard and teach them teamwork feats. If you want a brawler like Bane\
  \ who is at her best due to chemical enhancements, the Mutagenic Mauler has your\
  \ back. And the Shield Champion throws her shield like Captain America. I mean look\
  \ at that Shield Champion. It seems like she's about to punch you in the face right\
  \ after the shield hits you and leaves you reeling. How cool is that? And that's\
  \ only the first half of the archetypes in the book!</p> \n     <p>So to recap,\
  \ the brawler is the monk's rowdy cousin, more interested in kicking ass than contemplating\
  \ koans. The brawler is the Chuck Norris base class, and she's not afraid to get\
  \ her hands dirty. Are you?</p> \n     <p>Mark Seifter<br> <i>Designer</i></p> \n\
