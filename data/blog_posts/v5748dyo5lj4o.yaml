  \     <p itemprop=\"description\">We're three weeks from the official release date\
  \ of <a href=\"/products/btpy9oco\"><em>Pathfinder Worldscape #1</em></a>, the first\
  \ issue of the new Pathfinder comic series from Dynamite! Worldscape crosses over\
  \ the Pathfinder heroes Valeros, Seoni, Kyra, and Merisiel with a host of sword\
  \ &amp; sorcery superstars including Red Sonja, John Carter of Mars, Tarzan, Thun'da,\
  \ Fantomah, and more! In addition to six monthly issues of pulse-pounding inter-dimensional\
  \ adventure, each issue includes a Pathfinder RPG rules appendix that contains official\
  \ game statistics for the series' guest stars, new race information for the unique\
  \ creatures that appear in the series like Barsoomian green Martians, and so on.\
  \ I'm writing the series, and taking the lead on the game design portions of the\
  \ appendices. That's a huge honor, of course, but it's also a significant responsibility.\
  \ When presented with such a cool opportunity, the last thing I want to do is mess\
  \ it up!</p> \n     <p>I've spoken at length about the characters, plot, and origins\
  \ of <a href=\"/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics/worldscape\"\
  >Pathfinder Worldscape</a> with <a href=\"http://www.bleedingcool.com/2016/08/23/pathfinder-meets-hyboria-barsoom-golarion-and-more\"\

  \ target=\"_blank\">Things from Another World</a>, but every Wednesday from now\
  \ until the end of the series, I plan to peel back the skin of the RPG side of <a\
  \ href=\"/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics/worldscape\"\
  >Pathfinder Worldscape</a> right here on the Paizo Blog, in a new series I'm calling\
  \ Worldscape Workbook.</p> \n     <p>How did I choose which characters to adapt?\
  \ Why did I make this or that decision about how to bring their weird powers, equipment,\
  \ or racial abilities into the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game? I'll be letting you\
  \ know right here every week with a look into my thought process, as wrong-headed\
  \ as that may sometimes prove to be.</p> \n     <p>I'm thrilled to be able to bring\
  \ so many amazing characters from the sword &amp; sorcery, pulp, and comics tradition\
  \ to Pathfinder, and the resulting discussions around the Paizo editorial office\
  \ were interesting enough that I thought you would appreciate a fly-on-the-wall\
  \ look at how it's all gone down so far.</p> \n     <p><a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lj46\"\
  >Last week</a>, I kicked off the Worldscape Workbook with a look at Red Sonja's\
  \ (in)famous \"chainmail bikini,\" and how I jumped through several hoops and ran\
  \ into some development dead-ends trying to figure out how to make it work in Pathfinder.\
  \ In the end, I decided Sonja's skimpy armor wasn't armor at all, and resolved to\
  \ use a special archetype to give her the Armor Class oomph necessary to go toe-to-toe\
  \ with some of the nastiest customers of the Hyborian Age.</p> \n     <p>But as\
  \ archetypes modify specific Pathfinder RPG class abilities, before I could get\
  \ to the details of Red Sonja's archetype, I knew I had an even more important question\
  \ to answer: What is Red Sonja's class?</p> \n     <p>The easy, almost reflexive\
  \ answer, is that Red Sonja is a barbarian. Her past as the daughter of a chieftain\
  \ in the Hyrkanian Steppes is more barbaric than cosmopolitan, to be sure, but (as\
  \ with most things), the \"simple\" solution really isn't the best, and isn't very\
  \ true to her character as presented in the comic books.</p> \n     <p>Which, actually,\
  \ brings up a fair point. Red Sonja first appeared in a 1973 Conan the Barbarian\
  \ comic written by Roy Thomas and illustrated by Barry Windsor Smith. A natural\
  \ female foil for the hard-headed Conan, comic book Sonja drew inspiration from\
  \ Conan creator Robert E. Howard's Red Sonya (note the \"Y\"), a swashbuckler historical\
  \ adventure character from the 1934 story \"Shadow of the Vulture.\" In the more\
  \ than 40 years since that original comic appearance, Sonja has had scores of writers\
  \ and artists, all of whom brought their own approach to the character. Like many\
  \ multi-decade comics heroes, there are a lot of \"takes\" on Sonja's origin, personality,\
  \ and skill set.</p> \n     <p>To prepare for <a href=\"/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics/worldscape\"\
  >Pathfinder Worldscape</a>, I read about 100 Red Sonja comics, ranging from her\
  \ original 1970s adventures (published by Marvel) to the most recent issues of her\
  \ current series from our partners at Dynamite. For key character details, I focused\
  \ most strongly on writer Gail Simone and artist Walter Giovani's landmark 18-issue\
  \ run that kicked off with the re-imagined origin of Red Sonja in the <a href=\"\
  http://www.dynamite.com/htmlfiles/viewProduct.html?PRO=C1606904817\" target=\"_blank\"\
  >Queen of Plagues</a> story arc from 2013. While keeping the most important elements\
  \ of Sonja's origin and character intact, Simone's revamp gave Red Sonja more agency\
  \ even before the tragedy that put her on the path of the warrior. Gone was the\
  \ empowering goddess Scathach, the 1970s source of Red Sonja's fighting prowess.\
  \ Gone was her ridiculous vow of chastity to only bed men who had bested her in\
  \ combat. And gone, too, were other depressing elements of sexual violence to Sonja's\
  \ origin story that probably seemed appropriate to a male comics writer in the early\
  \ 70s, but which are grating and deeply un-empowering by modern standards.</p> \n\
  \     <p>For me, the Simone reboot keeps or amplifies everything that makes Red\
  \ Sonja a compelling character while jettisoning the lamer elements of the original\
  \ origin, creating a hero who cut her way to greatness under her own power as opposed\
  \ to a puppet of a mostly absent chastity-obsessed war goddess. Opinions probably\
  \ differ, but I considered it a vast improvement. I therefore turned mostly to the\
  \ 2013 arc for issues related to Red Sonja's early life, which of course plays directly\
  \ into decisions about her official Pathfinder class.</p> \n     <p>As I read through\
  \ my huge pile of Red Sonja comics, it became very clear to me that Red Sonja was\
  \ not a barbarian at all, at least by the standards of the Pathfinder rules. For\
  \ starters, while Red Sonja certainly displays anger and combat prowess throughout\
  \ her adventures, she doesn't \"rage\" in the traditional Pathfinder sense. Her\
  \ anger and fury doesn't translate into short bursts of greater power. In fact,\
  \ over the course of her adventures, \"Strength\" isn't really emphasized at all.\
  \ During a recent Conan/Red Sonja crossover, Red Sonja's speed and, in game terms,\
  \ Dexterity, were emphasized in direct contrast to Conan's Cimmerian brawn. Comic\
  \ book Conan may, in fact, be a barbarian, but it's simply not a good fit for Red\
  \ Sonja.</p> \n     <p>Ok, then, maybe she's something funky and off-beat like the\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy978v\"><em>Advanced Class Guide's</em></a> brawler, or\
  \ even a swashbuckler? Well, maybe, but for major heroes like Red Sonja and John\
  \ Carter, I wanted to use one of the Pathfinder game's core base classes to start\
  \ with, because I imagine these comics will be drawing in people who are roughly\
  \ familiar with the primary Pathfinder game rules, but maybe not with our secondary\
  \ or tertiary class books. So I decided to close that particular door before delving\
  \ too deeply into it myself.</p> \n     <p>What about a fighter? Red Sonja is undoubtedly\
  \ known for combat prowess, swordcraft, and bow skill. In Pathfinder terms, she's\
  \ definitely in the d10 Hit Die camp, with the resulting \"best\" Base Attack Bonus\
  \ progression that goes with it. Fighter certainly qualified on that front. The\
  \ class would also load up Sonja with a bunch of cool combat feats, which would\
  \ make her an even more formidable opponent—a design goal I definitely did not want\
  \ to overlook.</p> \n     <p>All that said, fighter provided one major challenge,\
  \ above and beyond the fact that Armor Training is one of the fighter's most important\
  \ class features, and I'd already decided that Red Sonja basically didn't wear armor.\
  \ I could always use Sonja's archetype to \"swap out\" Armor Training for something\
  \ that gave her an Armor Class bonus when not wearing armor, but when you take away\
  \ the fighter's Armor Training and Armor Mastery, there isn't an awful lot of other\
  \ goodies left over to trade out for other archetype powers. And, after reading\
  \ 100 Red Sonja comics, I knew I had some other powers I wanted to give her.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>That led me to consider a solution that, when originally posted to my\
  \ Facebook fan page before my reading spree, didn't seem to make a whole lot of\
  \ sense. What about the ranger?</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a\
  \ href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderComics/20160928-Tracking.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderComics/20160928-Tracking_500.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>A close look at Red Sonja's origin story suggested\
  \ that the idea had a lot of merit. To recap, Red Sonja was the daughter of a chieftain\
  \ of the Hyrkanian Steppes, a huge land in the east of Robert E. Howard's Hyborian\
  \ Age. When she was 12, marauders sacked her village and murdered the rest of the\
  \ family, making vengeance a huge part of Sonja's motivation from almost the very\
  \ beginning. Almost. Consider this interaction between Sonja and her father, shortly\
  \ before the raiders arrive, when the family is out on a hunt.</p> \n     <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n      <img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderComics/20160928-BestHunter.jpg\"\
  >\n     </div> \n     <p>So, by the age of 12, Red Sonja is \"better with a bow\
  \ than anyone in our village,\" and she knows \"every bit of woodlore we can teach.\"\
  \ Her father further adds, \"No one can shoot or track better.\" That's compelling\
  \ evidence and probably enough to make the case alone, but there's more.</p> \n\
  \     <p>Throughout the series, Sonja' enemies call her \"Sonja the Hunter,\" an\
  \ appellation she mentions herself, as well. In Simone's second story arc, <a href=\"\
  \ http://www.dynamite.com/htmlfiles/viewProduct.html?PRO=C1606905295\" target=\"\
  blank\">The Art of Blood and Fire</a>, a southern potentate named Emperor Samala\
  \ hires \"Sonja the Hunter\" to track down the world's six greatest artisans for\
  \ a party commemorating his imminent death and entombment. \"I need a tracker,\"\
  \ he says on the following page.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <img\
  \ src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderComics/20160928-EmperorSamala.jpg\"\
  >\n     </div> \n     <p>Want more proof? Here's Red Sonja tracking a group of fish-men\
  \ through a watery swamp. Note also that Sonja uses a shortbow in this scene, which\
  \ she does commonly throughout the series—further proof that I needed to figure\
  \ out a way to work her ranged combat expertise into her overall rules presentation.</p>\
  \ \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderComics/20160928-Upwind.jpg\"\
  >\n     </div> \n     <p>Lastly, Red Sonja shows strong animal affinity throughout\
  \ her many appearances, and seems to especially despise cruelty to animals. In the\
  \ aforementioned Conan/Red Sonja crossover (published by current Conan publisher\
  \ Dark Horse under arrangement with Dynamite and co-written by Simone and former\
  \ Pathfinder comics writer Jim Zub), Red Sonja encounters a cruel animal trainer\
  \ named Kalayah, who later appears as one of Emperor Samala's \"greatest artisans\
  \ in the world,\" much to Sonja's ire. Check out the way she talks about Kalayah's\
  \ horrible treatment of his performing animals.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n      <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderComics/20160928-VSKalayah.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderComics/20160928-VSKalayah_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Spoiler alert: It doesn't end well for Kalayah.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>So that's several signifiers that point in the direction of a ranger:\
  \ Excellent bow skills, total mastery of woodlore, respect and affinity for animals,\
  \ tracking ability so strong her reputation as a hunter spreads to the leaders of\
  \ distant foreign nations. And one more thing so common I didn't even bother looking\
  \ for images to prove it to you—Red Sonja constantly fights with two weapons, another\
  \ hallmark of the Pathfinder ranger.</p> \n     <p>Of course, the Pathfinder RPG\
  \ ranger has a lot of class features that aren't appropriate for Red Sonja. She\
  \ doesn't have an animal companion. She doesn't seem to favor a particular type\
  \ of enemy over any other. She doesn't have what Pathfinder calls \"favored terrain.\"\
  \ And, perhaps most importantly, she doesn't cast spells.</p> \n     <p>While those\
  \ inappropriate class features look like they disqualify the ranger from contention,\
  \ in fact I was thrilled to have them. Staying competitive without wearing armor\
  \ is a pretty major power, and I had other elements—such as Red Sonja's \"Curse\
  \ of Hyrkania\" death vow—that were also going to be necessary to keep her competitive\
  \ with other d10 Hit Die warrior types.</p> \n     <p>Making those powers work would\
  \ mean swapping out significant, powerful, and frequently useful class features—\
  exactly the type of \"inappropriate\" class features provided by the ranger.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>To me, that looked an awful lot like a solution.</p> \n     <p>Red Sonja\
  \ is a ranger.</p> \n     <p>She's not just a ranger, though. She's a ranger with\
  \ the very special \"sword-devil\" archetype, which I'll begin to go into in next\
  \ week's installment of the Worldscape Workbook!</p> \n     <p>Until then, please\
