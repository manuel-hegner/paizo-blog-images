  \           <h1>Certainty</h1>\n           <p>by Liane Merciel</p>\n           <h2>Chapter\
  \ One: The Crusade</h2>\n           <blockquote>\n            <p>There aren't many\
  \ old paladins.</p>\n            <p>Mostly we die. Spend year after year fighting\
  \ everything from boggards to balors, and sooner or later one of them will take\
  \ off your head. Or you succumb to rice-water fever while wandering in the bowels\
  \ of a festering swamp. Or that smiling innkeeper with the dirty jokes turns out\
  \ to be a secret cultist of Norgorber and slits your throat while you snore.</p>\n\
  \            <p>Few of us last ten years.</p>\n            <p>We don't all die on\
  \ the battlefield, though. Sometimes it's quieter than that. Sometimes it's as simple\
  \ as a loss of certainty.</p>\n            <p>Live in the world long enough, and\
  \ you lose sight of the lines between good and evil. There aren't many true innocents\
  \ out there. Maybe none. The maiden you save from a dragon grows into a mean old\
  \ drunk who harangues her neighbors and kicks her dogs. The merchant you rescue\
  \ from bandits turns out to be a cheat who's abandoned a dozen bastards around the\
  \ Inner Sea.</p>\n            <p>And evil? Evil is no easier. Most criminals are\
  \ only men, and stupid and frightened ones at that. But they're the easiest to punish;\
  \ they've done wrong, and know it, and will pay the price.</p>\n            <p>The\
  \ great evils trouble me more. Devils are evil. Diabolists, worse: they enable the\
  \ fiends in our world. But I look at Cheliax—my poor, cursed homeland—and wonder\
  \ whether grim peace is not, truly, better for the commoners than the civil war\
  \ they had before, or the perpetually churning bloodshed in Galt. I hear of the\
  \ Gray Corsairs' raids, and wonder whether it was worth the drowning of three galleys\
  \ to strike a blow against slavers. The galley rowers were slaves too. Might they\
  \ not have preferred to live, even if in chains?</p>\n            <p>I don't know.\
  \ I haven't known for a long time.</p>\n            <p>I am not the first of my\
  \ brethren to succumb to doubt. Ours is a high and narrow road. It's easy to falter,\
  \ easy to fall. Almost impossible to climb back up.</p>\n            <p>Most never\
  \ try.</p>\n            <p>Some surrender to the emptiness, living out their days\
  \ in a slow gray mire. Some rebel, blaming the gods for their failures instead of\
  \ themselves, and seek out new, malevolent masters.</p>\n            <p>A few join\
  \ grand crusades, dying in a blaze of glory that might—<em>might</em>—be bright\
  \ enough to blot out the stain of sin. That's always struck me as the best way.\
  \ Find the easy choices, the clear lines. Die a hero. Let no one see the doubt.</p>\n\
  \            <p>I joined the grandest crusade of them all.</p>\n            <p></p>I\
  \ went to the Worldwound. \n            <br>\n            <p align=\"center\">∗\
  \ ∗ ∗</p>\n            <br>\n            <p>It was a snowy, bitter morn when I came\
  \ to the gates of Kenabres. For the past ten days I had been studying the wardstones\
  \ in the distance. They shadowed the lines of the road like an endless march of\
  \ tombstones, commemorating the thousands who had died in Sarkoris and the thousands\
  \ more that would die trying to save the rest of Avistan from that fate. Commemorating\
  \ me, maybe.</p>\n            <p>Behind the wardstones the sky was smudged soot-black,\
  \ stained by a fire that would roar unsated until it devoured the world. I never\
  \ saw anything stirring in that poisoned air, but the red-bellied clouds were warning\
  \ enough. Here lay the end of the world.</p>\n            <p>I did not come to Kenabres\
  \ alone. On the road I had fallen in with other desperate, damned souls. Some wanted\
  \ to confront death on their own terms; others wanted to live, at least for one\
  \ more day, and had nowhere to do it but here.</p>\n            <p>During the journey\
  \ I learned some of their names and some of their reasons. Jelani was a Thuvian\
  \ sand-dancer who said she was dying of a wasting disease, though I saw no mark\
  \ of it on her. Her parents lived in poverty on the far side of the Inner Sea, and\
  \ even after she learned she was ill, she sent her earnings to them rather than\
  \ paying a healer's fee. She had heard that Queen Galfrey offered free healing to\
  \ anyone who joined the crusade, and had come in hopes that the rumor was true.\
  \ Even if it wasn't, she said, better to die for an honorable cause than rot in\
  \ a sickbed.</p>\n            <p>Most of my companions were less noble. Robbers,\
  \ blasphemers, cattle thieves. The best of the lot was a mere debtor, cast in with\
  \ the others when he borrowed to fuel his gambling and found the dice fickle as\
  \ ever. All of them had been offered a choice between the gallows and the Worldwound.\
  \ All had chosen to go north, though few had any training in arms and none had been\
  \ properly schooled in sword or lance. Not one of them expected to leave Mendev\
  \ alive.</p>\n            <p>These were my new comrades-in-arms. They made me glad\
  \ I had already forsaken my oaths, and bitter that I had fallen so low. In my old\
  \ life I would have sent them to the hangman or lopped their heads off myself. Now\
  \ I could only hope they'd prove less dangerous at my back than the demons would\
  \ be to my face.</p>\n            <p>The people of Mendev seemed nearly as suspicious\
  \ of their saviors as I was. We spotted sentries ranging ahead of us a day's walk\
  \ from the fortress town, and at the gates were greeted by bearded men in hard-used\
  \ mail. Pots of acrid incense burned in the hollow merlons, draping the walls in\
  \ curtains of ghostly white smoke. I smelled cedar and clove, and something else,\
  \ unfamiliar, that tickled my nose and left me light-headed. Magic? If so, it was\
  \ none I had seen before.</p>\n            <p>While archers kept arrows trained\
  \ on us from the walls, a priest wearing Iomedae's radiant sword ordered us to doff\
  \ our hoods, baring our faces to the cold. I turned my eyes away from the symbol\
  \ of my old goddess, gritting my teeth at the touch of her magic <em>outside</em>\
  \ me—always and forever, outside—but the priest didn't seem to notice. He chanted\
  \ over us, beseeching Iomedae to show the truth of our natures, and only when he\
  \ was satisfied that we were not demon-touched did the gates open at last.</p>\n\
  \            <p>\"You must forgive us,\" he said. \"We have hard troubles here.\"\
  </p>\n            <p>No one answered him. What was there to say? We all knew of\
  \ his nation's troubles. They were why we had come, willingly or not.</p>\n    \
  \        <p>Inside the walls I saw more scars from Kenabres' long struggle. It would\
  \ have been impossible to tell from walking through it that this town held the attackers,\
  \ not the besieged. There were no cats in its streets, and the alleys held more\
  \ rat-traps than rodents: the people had eaten their pets and were reduced to snaring\
  \ vermin for food.</p>\n            <p>Peddlers crowded every corner, doing a brisk\
  \ business in amulets and potions that promised protection from demons. I saw few\
  \ women, and most of those were either painted bawds or Kellid giant-hunters, as\
  \ wild and dangerous as their men. Mendev's wives and children had been sent to\
  \ safety long ago. I wondered how many had become widows and orphans since then.</p>\n\
  \            <p>The gate guards shepherded us to a long, low building that served\
  \ as a barracks. Banners and pennons from a hundred nations, city-states, and petty\
  \ lordlings hung from its walls in a riot of dusty color. Among them hung stranger,\
  \ grimmer trophies: weapons and battle-flags taken from vanquished foes in the Worldwound.\
  \ I spotted a few skeletal claws and carapaces mounted in the corners. No skulls,\
  \ though. Even dead—even taken as a prize of war—no one wanted those eyes on them\
  \ as they slept.</p>\n            <p>A one-armed soldier seated at a battered desk\
  \ took down our names and skills. His face had been dissolved by acid, perhaps in\
  \ the same attack that took his arm; his cheeks hung down to his collar in ripples\
  \ of shiny pink slag, and he looked half demon himself. Only one eye had been spared,\
  \ but that eye narrowed sharply when I gave my name for his book.</p>\n        \
  \    <p>\"Ederras.\" He flicked a glance at my shield, then looked back at me, coolly\
  \ appraising. \"No title? No talents?\"</p>\n            <p>I wondered if he recognized\
  \ the golden wings painted on the oak, or if it was something else that had betrayed\
  \ me. Perhaps I should have discarded the shield along with my blessed sword and\
  \ the helm I was no longer worthy to wear... but the shield held one of the few\
  \ enchantments that still worked for me, and I was loath to face the Worldwound\
  \ with no magic.</p>\n            <p>\"No title,\" I said. \"No talents.\"</p>\n\
  \            <p>He didn't press me, moving on to the next man—Persil, a brewer exiled\
  \ after his beer sickened and killed a dozen revelers at a Merrymead celebration.\
  \ He swore it was an accident, and I believed him, but that hadn't saved the stammering\
  \ youth from the local swordlord's justice.</p>\n            <p>None of the others\
  \ admitted to much until the scarred soldier came to Jelani. She gave her name,\
  \ acknowledged her lack of title, and smiled when he asked for her talents.</p>\n\
  \            <p>\"Fire and sand,\" she said, lifting a hand. A tiny whirlwind spun,\
  \ sparkling, over her palm. It seemed to be made up of gold motes rather than ordinary\
  \ dust. Each speck glowed with its own fiery light. That light shone strangely on\
  \ her face; at that moment she seemed inhuman, her pupils replaced by dark flame,\
  \ her skin the glossy bronze of a Vudrani idol. She was not speaking loudly, yet\
  \ her voice filled the barracks and quelled all other sound. \"The heat of the desert\
  \ wind. The blaze of the unfailing sun. Those are the powers I command, Mendevian.\
  \ Will they do?\"</p>\n            <p>The soldier shrugged with his good arm, drawing\
  \ a stylized flame next to Jelani's name. \"If not, you'll soon find out. Battle\
  \ magic or builder's?\"</p>\n            <p>Jelani closed her hand. The fire died;\
  \ that strange light passed. She seemed a harmless girl again. \"Battle.\"</p>\n\
  \            <p>The soldier smiled for the first time since he'd seen us. \"Good.\"\
  \ He fanned his quill over the ink to dry it, then closed his book. \"You'll get\
  \ your weapons now.\"</p>\n            <p>\"I have weapons,\" one of the cattle-thieves\
  \ protested. He was a shaggy, slope-browed brute of a man, and he carried an axe\
  \ to match.</p>\n            <p>The one-armed soldier was unimpressed. \"Are they\
  \ blessed? Cold-forged? No? Not likely to give a demon any trouble, then. You can\
  \ swing that axe until your beard goes gray, but if you're not wielding cold iron\
  \ you won't leave a scratch on any of the beasts you're like to face here. The weapons\
  \ we'll give you aren't fancy. No engravings, no gilt, no pretty little master's\
  \ mark. But they can make those bastards bleed.\"</p>\n            <p>\"You'll want\
  \ holy water, too,\" said a Kellid woman. Triangles and knotted circles in red ochre\
  \ covered her shoulders and collarbones, vanishing into the deerskin tunic she wore.\
  \ \"Not little vials like you carry in the south. Skins of it. Some of the demons\
  \ have acid or stinking slime. Use the water to wash it off. Use the water to kill\
  \ them, too, if you lose your sword. But don't waste it. Might need to drink it.\
  \ Other water turns to poison near the Worldwound sometimes. Holy water's safer—\
  as long as it lasts.\"</p>\n            <p>\"We won't throw you out there like raw\
  \ meat to wolves,\" the one-armed soldier said, reading the fear on the faces around\
  \ him. \"I won't lie: our need is desperate, and we're not training Andoren knights\
  \ here. We don't have <em>time</em> to drill you for ten years in the training field.\
  \ But we won't be sending you out against balors before you've learned to hold a\
  \ sword, either. If you've never fought, we'll teach you. Until then, you'll tend\
  \ animals, help the healers, brew whitesmoke for the pots. The work we do in town\
  \ is as important as anything that happens on the wardstones.</p>\n            <p>\"\
  If you <em>do</em> know how to fight, however, we'll be sending you out once you're\
  \ armed.\" He looked directly at me as he said it. I returned his gaze, impassive.\
  \ \"Our battle never ends. This is like no war you've ever fought.\"</p>\n     \
  \       <p>\"I've never fought in any war,\" Persil mumbled.</p>\n            <p></p>\"\
  You're in one now.\" The soldier grinned. \"Welcome to the Worldwound.\" \n    \
