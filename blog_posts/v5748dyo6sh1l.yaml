  \    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">With the holiday season upon\
  \ us, December also brings a slightly early release for Organized Play scenarios—\
  which works because it gives our community something to play during the holidays\
  \ and allows the Organized Play Team to enjoy some days off! Our releases this month\
  \ take us to two extremes of our level range, with a level 1–4 scenario and then\
  \ our first foray into higher levels with our inaugural offering for levels 9–12.\
  \ Let’s dive right in.</p> \n     <p><a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq022bi?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-213-Storm-of-the-End-Times\"\
  ><b>Starfinder Society #2-13: Storm of the End Times</b></a>, a scenario for levels\
  \ 1-4 from Starfinder Society veteran Nicholas Wasko, takes us to a place first\
  \ mentioned in our <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy9u7x?Starfinder-Society-Quest-Into-the-Unknown\"\
  >initial quest pack</a>: the oceanic world of Wealdriad. Sent to observe a rare\
  \ natural phenomenon, the PCs must balance their roles as ambassadors, scientists,\
  \ and researchers as they set-up on Wealdriad’s mysterious basalt pillars. Of course,\
  \ not everything goes according to plan, and the PCs must step-up to stop one of\
  \ the visiting groups from ruining the entire viewing. Storm of the End Times is\
  \ appropriate for low-level play, while also providing some interesting new lore\
  \ on one of Starfinder’s most popular species! </p> \n     <p>Here’s just one of\
  \ the NPCs that the PCs have the chance to meet during this scenario</p> \n    \

  \ \n     </div> \n     <p>As our ongoing Year of a Thousand Bites metaplot ramps\
  \ up, so does the need for higher level adventurers. <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq022bj?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-214-Data-Purge\"\
  ><b>Starfinder Society #2-14: Data Purge</b></a>, by Cole Kronewitter, is our first\
  \ scenario for levels 9-12 and brings together a group of PCs for one of the most\
  \ audacious missions yet: breaking into the Lorespire Complex. I want to tell a\
  \ whole bunch of stories about this adventure, but I think it’s best for players\
  \ to experience this scenario for themselves. Luckily for everyone out there, Cole\
  \ has done an amazing job of putting together a “reverse-heist” that involves a\
  \ lot of different encounter types, some career capstone-level encounters, and even\
  \ a bit of time to just sit back and snack on an apple or two. </p> \n     <p>Here’\
  s a shot of an interesting NPC who the PCs may meet inside the Lorespire campus.</p>\

  \ \n     </div> \n     <p>That’s it for December’s preview. I hope everyone can\
  \ spend some time over the holidays relaxing, spending time with family and loved\
  \ ones, and (of course) getting in some games of Starfinder Society. Stay tuned\
  \ for January’s preview, when we come back with a pair of scenarios that take us\
  \ somewhere we’ve never explored and a return to a planet we haven’t been to since\
  \ the early days of Season 1.</p> \n     <p>Join us for next week’s blog, when our\
  \ newest developer James Case gives us his take on life, the universe, and being\
  \ a part of the organized play team.</p> \n     <p>Until next time,</p> \n     <p\
