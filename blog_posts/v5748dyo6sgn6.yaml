  \ I began my freelance career with Paizo on a little book called the <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy99s4?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Giant-Hunters-Handbook\"><em>Giant\
  \ Hunter's Handbook</em></a>. Here I am years later actually working at Paizo and\
  \ getting to close the book on the Player Companion line. It's kind of a bittersweet\
  \ moment as I've come to grow the line, but I know its new, younger sibling, the\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btq01y0o?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-World-Guide\"><em>Lost Omens\
  \ World Guide</em></a>, will be a great line in its own right!</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  ></a> \n     <p>Illustration by Nathanael James</p>\n    </div> \n    <p>To celebrate\
  \ the Player Companion's ride off into the sunset, we wanted to go out with something\
  \ big. This is how <a href=\"/products/btq01yji?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Chronicle-of-Legends\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Player Companion: Chronicle of Legends</em></a> came about. There's\
  \ a lot of material in the ten years of Pathfinder First Edition's history. From\
  \ humble beginnings with the Advanced Player's Guide to the fantastic and powerful\
  \ Mythic Adventures to the weird and enigmatic Occult Adventures, there is enough\
  \ material to run games for years to come. However, there are always stones to be\
  \ turned! We wanted to take a chance to poke around in the less explored sections\
  \ of the game and blaze new trails while we still had our chance and this book was\
  \ our shot at doing just that! To best present all of the fresh new ideas we wanted\
  \ to present, we decided to present the book as if it were snippets and entries\
  \ from the various issues and volumes of the <em>Pathfinder Chronicles</em>. Each\
  \ section has a fun little excerpt from a volume that presents the exciting ideas\
  \ of the section and hints at some of the great stories throughout Golarion's history.</p>\
  \ \n    <p><em>Chronicle of Legends</em> is packed to the brim with brand new options\
  \ that carve out new mechanical space for first edition. One of these options is\
  \ the new exemplar traits. These traits are more powerful versions of the traits\
  \ you know and love except that they can grow in power based on your other traits.\
  \ For example, the Traveler of a Hundred Lands trait allows you to gain more class\
  \ skills for every two regional traits you have. Another set of new options are\
  \ the battle standards for cavaliers and samurai that will enable you to replace\
  \ your banner with a new standard that gives a different set of options or the gunslinger\
  \ and swashbuckler renowned deeds that swap out existing deeds for new abilities.</p>\

  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderPlayerCompanion/PZO9496-Ritualist_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n     <p>Illustration by Alyssa McCarthy</p>\n    </div> \n    <p>For those\
  \ with a spellcasting bent, there are several new options to show your mastery of\
  \ magic. You might unlock the secrets of powerful spells like rival's weald, which\
  \ can permanently transform your enemies into trees. Instead, you can take the Magic\
  \ Trick feat to expand your prowess with specific spells. The feat allows a spellcaster\
  \ to concentrate a fireball into a smaller area that deals more damage or even break\
  \ it up into smaller explosions that you can toss all over the battlefield.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>We also have new magic items with a twist for you! You can look into\
  \ special items known as legacy items. These unique magic items from Golarion's\
  \ history grow in power alongside their owner and even become more powerful after\
  \ completing specific tasks. If you wear Amatatsu Aganhei's <em>trailblazer's boots</em>,\
  \ you will be quicker and hardier in dangerous environments. If you manage to walk\
  \ 1,000 miles in the boots, you can also designate your surroundings as your favored\
  \ terrain. In addition to legacy items, we also have new equipment sets. These are\
  \ specific items that grow in power and even grant new abilities as you collect\
  \ the set. Collecting <em>Beastmaster</em>'s Will grants you the movement of the\
  \ great beasts of nature and eventually the hunter's animal focus ability.</p> \n\
  \    <p>As many groups will be wrapping up campaigns in anticipation of second edition,\
  \ we wanted to provide support for high-level characters as well. It doesn't get\
  \ any higher than 20th level, so we have new capstones for these characters! These\
  \ include the likes of the inquisitor's team leader ability that allows her to share\
  \ several of her teamwork feats or the kineticist's unbridled power ability that\
  \ empowers her blasts. If you prefer, we also have generic capstones that are available\
  \ to most any class like the perfect body, flawless mind ability that allows you\
  \ to increase your ability scores to legendary amounts or won't stay dead which\
  \ allows you to come back after death over and over again. Whether your class is\
  \ core, alternate, base, hybrid, occult, or unchained, you have a new capstone option!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>What if you have a prestige class, though? Well, we have something for\
  \ you, too! The prestige class has gone relatively unsupported for years, so we\
  \ wanted to make up for lost time. This book presents new feats for each of the\
  \ prestige classes in the <em>Core Rulebook</em>. This includes feats like Storm\
  \ of Arrows that allow arcane archers to target twice as many foes with their hail\
  \ of arrows. We also have two new prestige classes, the esoteric knight and ritualist,\
  \ to provide support for some of our occult classes. In fact, we had so much support\
  \ for our prestige classes that we couldn't fit them all in the book! One of the\
  \ options we wanted to present were new archetypes specifically for prestige classes.\
  \ Since we don't have space in the book for them, you get them here, our treat!</p>\

  ></a> \n     <p>Illustration by Michele Giorgi</p>\n    </div> \n    <h2>Prestige\
  \ Archetypes</h2> \n    <p>The following archetypes are available for prestige classes.\
  \ These archetypes replace specific abilities of the prestige class much in the\
  \ same way that archetypes do for standard classes. Each prestige archetype has\
  \ unique requirements that replace the prestige class's standard requirements. You\
  \ must meet these requirements before you can take the first level of the prestige\
  \ class with the associated prestige archetype.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <h3>Deadeye\
  \ Devotee (Arcane Archer Archetype)</h3> \n     <p>Dedicated followers of Erastil\
  \ become closer to their god by mastering archery and caring for each other. They\
  \ can tap into the power of the Elk Father, who guides and empowers their arrows.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><strong>Requirements</strong>: To qualify to become a Deadeye devotee,\
  \ a character must fulfill all the following criteria.<br> <em>Alignment</em>: Lawful\
  \ good, lawful neutral, or neutral good.<br> <em>Deity</em>: Must worship Erastil.<br>\
  \ <em>Base Attack Bonus</em>: +6.<br> <em>Feats</em>: Point Blank Shot, Precise\
  \ Shot, Weapon Focus (longbow).<br> <em>Spells</em>: Must be able to cast 1st-level\
  \ divine spells.<br> This alters requirements.</p> \n     <p><strong>Spells per\
  \ Day</strong>: At the indicated levels, a Deadeye devotee gains new spells per\
  \ day as if he had also gained a level in a divine spellcasting class he belonged\
  \ to before adding the prestige class. He does not, however, gain other benefits\
  \ a character of that class would have gained, except for additional spells per\
  \ day, spells known (if he is a spontaneous spellcaster), and an increased effective\
  \ level of spellcasting. If a character had more than one divine spellcasting class\
  \ before becoming a Deadeye devotee, he must decide to which class he adds the new\
  \ level for purposes of determining spells per day.<br> This alters spells per day.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><strong>Energy Arrow (Su)</strong>: At 4th level, when casting either\
  \ a cure or inflict spell, a deadeye devotee can create an arrow composed of positive\
  \ or negative energy. This ability allows the devotee to use the bow's range rather\
  \ than the spell's range to make a ranged touch attack. The physical damage that\
  \ would be dealt from a mundane arrow is converted into additional damage to the\
  \ inflict spell or into additional healing for a cure spell. A spell cast in this\
  \ way is a standard action and the deadeye devotee can fire the arrow as part of\
  \ the casting. If the arrow misses, the spell is wasted.<br> This replaces seeker\
  \ arrow.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <blockquote> \n     <h3>Thought Thief (Arcane\
  \ Trickster)</h3> \n     <p>A thought thief will happily rip ideas from their victim's\
  \ head and their gold from their purse.</p> \n     <p><strong>Requirements</strong>:\
  \ To qualify to become a thought thief, a character must fulfill all the following\
  \ criteria.<br> <em>Alignment</em>: Any nonlawful.<br> <em>Skills</em>: Disable\
  \ Device 4 ranks, Escape Artist 4 ranks, Knowledge (arcana) 4 ranks.<br> <em>Spells</em>:\
  \ Ability to cast mage hand and at least one psychic spell of 2nd level or higher.<br>\
  \ <em>Special</em>: Sneak attack +2d6.<br> This alters requirements.</p> \n    \
  \ <p><strong>Mental Assault (Su)</strong>: At 3rd level, once per day as a standard\
  \ action, a thought thief can pinpoint a target's trauma and exploit weakness with\
  \ a deluge of psychic power. This is a melee touch attack that deals damage equal\
  \ to her sneak attack damage and grants the thought thief control of the target\
  \ as <em>dominate person</em> for a number of rounds equal to her thought thief\
  \ level. A successful Will save (DC = 10 + the thought thief's level + her Charisma\
  \ modifier) negates the dominate effect. A thought thief can only use this ability\
  \ against a target that is susceptible to her sneak attack, such as a target she\
  \ is flanking. This attack has no effect on creatures without an intelligence score.\
  \ At 7th level, a thought thief can use this ability twice per day.<br> This replaces\
  \ impromptu sneak attack.</p> \n     <p><strong>Unseen Compulsion</strong>: At 5th\
  \ level a thought thief can hide the effects of any spell she casts with the mind-affecting\
  \ and compulsion spell descriptors. Creatures that observe her casting such a spell\
  \ can attempt a Sense Motive check to notice the spell (DC = 15 + the thought thief's\
  \ ranks in Bluff + the thought thief's Charisma modifier). Creatures that fail their\
  \ check are unaware of any effects of the thought thief's spell.<br> This replaces\
  \ tricky spells.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>As you can see, there's a lot\
  \ to love in <a href=\"/products/btq01yji?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Chronicle-of-Legends\"\
  ><em>Chronicle of Legends</em></a>. Make sure to snag your copy from paizo.com or\
  \ from your local gaming store. It's going to be legendary!</p> \n    <p>Luis Loza<br>\
