  \ class=\"PTales\"></div></a> \n    <h1>The Box</h1> \n    <p>by Bill Ward</p> \n\
  \    <p><a href=\"/pathfinder/tales/serial/theBox\">Click here to read this story\
  \ from the beginning.</a></p> \n    <h2>Chapter Two: Where the Heart Is</h2> \n\
  \    <p>It had been a busy day.</p> \n    <p>Kostin, sucking on split knuckles,\
  \ tried to look nonchalant as he waited near the entrance to the courtyard. \"Looks\
  \ like rain again,\" he said to the hatchet-faced Sczarni blade that eyed him like\
  \ a bird of prey studying a mouse. The guard did not reply.</p> \n    <p>Kostin\
  \ nodded good-naturedly, as if they were two old friends completely comfortable\
  \ sharing each other's silence. He casually let his gaze wander over the peeling\
  \ plaster of the courtyard arch, studying the thug out of the corner of his eye\
  \ as he did so. The man's clothing was a loose-fitting bloused shirt, brocaded at\
  \ the sides in red and yellow, spilling out from a tight woven vest in crazy-quilt\
  \ style. His trousers were a faded crimson stuffed into sailor's boots. He wore\
  \ more jewelry than a dockyard trollop, and his hair hung in heavy black curls to\
  \ the center of his chest.</p> \n    <p>Noticing the scrutiny, the guard shifted,\
  \ hooking his thumb into his broad sash, resting his hand close to the curved knife\
  \ he wore naked and gleaming at his side like the chip-edged cutlass of some Shackles\
  \ pirate. You had to admire the Sczarni, Kostin thought; they really played the\
  \ whole Varisian thug act to the hilt.</p> \n    <p>Granted, Kostin himself had\
  \ been playing at the same game scant hours ago—but at least he didn’t look like\
  \ he’d just stepped down from a covered wagon.</p> \n    <p>\"Come,\" said another\
  \ Sczarni stalking up out of the courtyard proper. \"The kapteo will see you.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Nice talking to you,\" Kostin said with a smirk to his minder, before\
  \ pivoting on his heels to leave.</p> \n    <p>\"<i>Muschi-uepoi</i>,\" the guard\
  \ spat at his back. Kostin's stride wavered for the blink of an eye, then he kept\
  \ moving.</p> \n    <p>It was the old, familiar insult: <i>muschi-uepoi</i>, or\
  \ “mossback.” One of the highest forms of contempt in the Varisian lexicon. A verbal\
  \ dart most appropriate for cowards and nestlings who had never gone out to travel\
  \ the world, citified dandies who had fallen from the true ways of the People and\
  \ turned away from their heritage. As far back as Kostin could remember, he had\
  \ been told this—told that he was not a real Varisian.</p> \n    <p>Rather amusing,\
  \ then, to think that poor Donal Carent, Kostin's informer at Dockway’s south impound\
  \ lot, had utterly no notion of this. No, for Donal, Kostin was the sum total image\
  \ of the Varisian criminal underworld—a veritable Sczarni bandit chief. That was\
  \ probably why, when Kostin had paid him a surprise visit this morning fresh from\
  \ sifting through the ashes of what had once been his home, Donal only needed minor\
  \ persuading to spill everything he knew.</p> \n    <p>Kostin sucked again at the\
  \ cut on his knuckle, and thought of the damned box as he followed the Sczarni thug\
  \ to the kapteo's tent.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Sczarni.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Sczarni_360.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n     <br> Among the Sczarni, a shoemaker is never just a shoemaker.\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>Tent. Here they were in Magnimar, a city that boasted more\
  \ buildings than it did people to live in them for much of the year, and the chief\
  \ of the Wreckwash Blades lived in a damned tent. The courtyard was central to an\
  \ entire block of tenements, all bursting with the Blades' families, but the kapteo\
  \ himself maintained the central position in what resembled a typical Varisian traveling\
  \ camp. Tents and wagons littered the area, as did the slow cookfires of a dozen\
  \ potato-faced matrons, busy monitoring their spicy <i>chap'vwlash</i> trail stews\
  \ with one eye while keeping the other fixed on the chaos of their barefoot grandchildren.\
  \ An ironsmith pounded out nails at an open-air anvil, a turner hunched over a foot-pumped\
  \ lathe, and a gaggle of women took turns milling at a portable grindstone. If it\
  \ were not for the clotheslines stretching overhead from window to window, Kostin\
  \ would have forgotten he was in the city at all.</p> \n    <p>They came up short\
  \ of the kapteo's tent, a green silk dome that was as humble in size as it was rich\
  \ in material. Kostin's escort snapped his fingers for attention and performed a\
  \ curious gesture, a raising and parting of the hands before the face. \"Do this\
  \ when you enter. Let me see you try.\"</p> \n    <p>Kostin obeyed, imitating the\
  \ gesture perfectly and adding a few flourishes of his own.</p> \n    <p>\"Good\
  \ enough,\" the guard grunted. Kostin thanked him.</p> \n    <p>The man spat on\
  \ the ground. \"I do not show you for your thanks, muschi-uepoi, but only so that\
  \ you do no dishonor to the kapteo.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Well, thanks anyway,\" Kostin\
  \ muttered as he stepped inside the tent.</p> \n    <p>In the smoky light of a single,\
  \ sputtering lantern, the kapteo of the Wreckwash Blades was hard at work mending\
  \ shoes.</p> \n    <p>\"Ah… Kapteo Giuleppeschi…?\" Kostin asked, confused. Could\
  \ this really be the captain of a criminal clan?</p> \n    <p>\"Sit,\" said the\
  \ old man, not bothering to look up from the floor and the simple leather shoe he\
  \ was hunched over. Arrayed about him were well-worn tools of the shoemaker's trade.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Kostin performed the gesture of obeisance he had been shown, uncertain\
  \ if the man had even seen it, and sat down cross-legged on a brocaded pillow.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Waiting in silence, Kostin watched the kapteo's strong hands draw sinew\
  \ thread through the tough old leather of the shoe. After a space of time that Kostin\
  \ could not measure, the kapteo spoke.</p> \n    <p>\"In life,\" he said, putting\
  \ down the shoe and raising his washed-out blue eyes to look directly at Kostin\
  \ for the first time, \"we do what we must. My father made shoes, and so I have\
  \ the skill. Your father was a good man, Kostinnavolus, and so I wonder why you\
  \ are perhaps a bad one?\"</p> \n    <p>Startled to hear his full name from the\
  \ mouth of a stranger, Kostin blurted, \"You didn’t know my father.\"</p> \n   \
  \ <p>The kapteo nodded. \"True. I only knew of him. There was a time when I knew\
  \ all the comings and goings of the People from Rag's End to the Underbridge. He\
  \ was a good man, as you know. He would not cross silver with us, with any clan.\
  \ And for that we loved him in our way—he was as the stone that does not feel the\
  \ storm. A strong man is like that, yes? Do you follow?\"</p> \n    <p>\"I…\" Kostin\
  \ was at a loss for words. He glanced down at his dirty breeches, ash-smeared from\
  \ the scorched remains of his father's home. He was conscious for the first time\
  \ of smelling like smoke.</p> \n    <p>\"But you are here, now.\" The kapteo grinned,\
  \ leaning back in evident satisfaction. \"And that can only mean you have failed\
  \ him, yes? You are a boy in trouble, a boy in a man's body, just as any nestling\
  \ who has hid like a child from the world.\" It was said mildly, matter-of-factly,\
  \ but the venom of the old man's words was palpable.</p> \n    <p>Kostin, anger\
  \ kindled, locked eyes with the kapteo and bared his teeth.</p> \n    <p>\"A friend\
  \ is an enemy's enemy,\" Kostin quoted the old Varisian saying. \"It's the same\
  \ in every language, <i>kapteo</i>. I'm not here for a handout, and Desna take your\
  \ insults. I'm here to make a deal about the Shoanti.\"</p> \n    <p>The kapteo\
  \ raised one bushy white eyebrow and gestured for Kostin to continue.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>\"The worst scum in Beacon Point—what do they call themselves? The Iron Eaters?\
  \ Something ridiculous. We both want them out of the picture—only you have an agreement\
  \ with the Night Scales not to touch them. They're the Scales' blunt instruments\
  \ in this part of town, and they push and push at you and all you can do is complain\
  \ to <i>navedo</i> bosses that life isn't fair.\" Kostin stopped, took a breath,\
  \ and noticed his hands were knotted into fists. \"I can get rid of them.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>A calculating look crept into the old man's eyes. \"If one pretends the\
  \ Scales will ignore what they can surely find out about such a deal, what do you\
  \ want from us?\"</p> \n    <p>Kostin named his figure.</p> \n    <p>The kapteo\
  \ licked his lips before speaking. \"A lot of coin. It will take time to raise such\
  \ a loan.\"</p> \n    <p>Kostin hissed a choice Varisian oath and slammed his hand\
  \ into the ground between them, sending a leather-punch skittering across the carpets.\
  \ The old man's eyes flashed fire, and his hand slipped to the hilt of his blade.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"It isn't a loan, you old cheat. Either I get it done, in which case\
  \ it's payment. Or I don't—in which case I'm dead, either at their hands or yours.\
  \ And I don't need coin. Hacksilver, trade bits, ingots—hell, dinnerware is fine,\
  \ just have it for me by this time tomorrow. I have people that need to get paid.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>The kapteo shook his head, his anger giving way to amusement. \"Too\
  \ much risk. I cannot say yes to this. But it is good to see the spirit of the People\
  \ is still in you, mossback.\"</p> \n    <p>Kostin leaned back and smiled. \"You\
  \ don't know the best part yet, kapteo. I admit that I'm an unknown quantity to\
  \ you—my abilities in this area cannot be seen as a guarantee. But the real risk\
  \ you’re talking about is retaliation from the Scales.\" Kostin scrutinized the\
  \ old man, noting his interest. \"But the Scales grow tired of their alley dogs,\
  \ and they've already tried to arrange the killing of the Shoanti Azahg, the mad\
  \ shaman that holds their leash.\"</p> \n    <p>\"And I am to take your word at\
  \ this? You would say anything; I see revenge in your eyes.\"</p> \n    <p>Kostin\
  \ stood. Reaching into his pocket, he pulled forth a wad of fire-blackened cloth,\
  \ its former intricate and multi-hued pattern barely discernable. It was his <i>kapenia</i>,\
  \ his family scarf. The story of his parents and his parents' parents, the story\
  \ of his life before it had been given him. He dropped the ruined thing before the\
  \ old man.</p> \n    <p>The kapteo smoothed the garment with bent fingers, and said\
  \ nothing.</p> \n    <p>\"This time, tomorrow. It's enough time to check my story.\
  \ One of Symirkova's brats down at the Bazaar can tell you all about the Kellid\
  \ freelancer who took a shot at Azahg, and how the deal was brokered by a couple\
  \ of town guards called Marster and Dennebris. Maybe you've already heard of that\
  \ pair—they certainly run their mouths enough. The girls of half-a-dozen Lowcleft\
  \ dance halls had plenty to repeat about those two, about how they like to go around\
  \ spending Night Scales silver and playing the big men.\"</p> \n    <p>Kostin declined\
  \ to mention the remaining link in the chain of information he had uncovered this\
  \ morning—that it was Donal Carent that had sent him sniffing after Marster and\
  \ Dennebris, the two men that had rolled into Dockyard impound one day with a cartful\
  \ of supposedly confiscated sundries and a false bill of lading. Their cargo had\
  \ disappeared by the end of the day, gone home in the pockets and pouches of a score\
  \ of guards and officials. All their cargo, that is, except for a black, wizard-locked\
  \ box.</p> \n    <p>The kapteo spoke after a moment's consideration, \"If this is\
  \ true, then the Scales will take care of our problem for us.\"</p> \n    <p>Kostin\
  \ shook his head. \"The Scales want to cut off the head of the beast, to better\
  \ control it. If they do that, your problem doesn't go away. If you back me on this,\
  \ what's left of the Shoanti will turn tail and scatter and the Scales won't press\
  \ the issue. It's the <i>navedo</i> way—they won't blood feud over a pack of foreign\
  \ gutter grubbers that they have already grown tired of.\"</p> \n    <p>Kostin paused,\
  \ studying the kapteo as he sat motionless in the dim interior, the old man's hands\
  \ moving delicately over the ruined fabric of the Dalakcz kapenia.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Let it be Sczarni silver,\" Kostin interjected into the silence that had fallen\
  \ between them, \"and a Varisian hand that accomplishes this task. That is <i>our</i>\
  \ way.\"</p> \n    <p>The kapteo nodded, once, decision made. \"Tomorrow you will\
  \ have your silver, if what you say is true. Desna walk with you, Kostinnavolus,\
  \ and may she light your path.\"</p> \n    <p>\"And yours, kapteo. My thanks.\"\
  \ Kostin bowed and slipped from the tent, fighting to keep a grin off of his face.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Outside the sky had cleared, and the first stars of early evening stood\
  \ out like hard diamonds in the fading blue. A day ago he had brought the box into\
  \ his home, the home he had watched burn from the fifth floor of the Rope Works\
  \ building while bucket teams scrambled to douse it. A day ago his life had changed\
  \ forever.</p> \n    <p>It was time to hit back. Time to cash in some favors, make\
  \ some promises, and build his team.</p> \n    <p><b>Coming Next Week:</b> Careful\
