  \ \n    <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, July 15, 2008</p> \n    <p>Do I have your attention\
  \ yet? I thought so. That's one nice thing about nerd culture (a term I use in the\
  \ most affectionate way)—we've got some easily recognizable triggers. For better\
  \ or for worse, there are certain touchstones that all of us in a given nerd subgroup\
  \ are familiar with (and no, I don't mean lolcats). I'm talking about the big stuff—\
  the media that shaped our favorite genres so irreversibly that there's really no\
  \ extricating the two. Sure, you can theorize about how modern fantasy might have\
  \ evolved if Tolkien had left those manuscripts in his bottom drawer, but really,\
  \ it's something of a moot point.</p> \n    <p>Which is why I'm so excited about\
  \ <i><a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy80ht\">Worlds of Their Own</a></i>.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Still following? I mean, let's just look at the author list here for a second.\
  \ In the same book, we've got Monte Cook, Elaine Cunningham, Richard E. Dansky,\
  \ Ed Greenwood, Jeff Grubb, Gary Gygax, Paul S. Kemp, J. Robert King, William King,\
  \ James Lowder, Will McDermott, R. A. Salvatore, Steven Savile, Lisa Smedman, Michael\
  \ A. Stackpole, Greg Stafford, Greg Stolze, and Nancy Virginia Varian. That's <i>huge</i>.\
  \ These are folks who have, through their shared-world fiction and gaming accomplishments,\
  \ left an indelible mark on our subculture. And in <i><a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy80ht\"\
  >Worlds of Their Own</a></i>, editor Jim Lowder (who's done some pretty seminal\
  \ work himself, with his bestselling Ravenloft novels, among others) turns these\
  \ authors loose to write in worlds of completely their own design, where their word\
  \ is final and not subject to an intellectual property's owner. Needless to say,\
  \ the work is stunning—I mean, we've got half a dozen New York Times bestsellers,\
  \ Nebula award winners, and more here—and often surprising to those only familiar\
  \ with an authors' shared-world stories.</p> \n    <p>As it would be a huge task\
  \ to try and explain each of these authors' impact, I decided to just pick two today\
  \ and show off chunks from their stories. But who to choose? William King? Richard\
  \ Dansky? Some of the authors I was able to set aside for future blog posts—after\
  \ all, this is not the first time Planet Stories or <i>Pathfinder</i> has worked\
  \ with folks like Gary Gygax, Elaine Cunningham, or Ed Greenwood, nor will it be\
  \ the last. In the end, though, I had to go with the two who inspired the title\
  \ of this post: R. A. Salvatore and Michael A. Stackpole.</p> \n    <p><b>R. A.\
  \ Salvatore</b> is probably the biggest success story in shared-world fiction. With\
  \ his creation of the dark elf hero Drizzt Do'Urden for the Forgotten Realms, he\
  \ blew the doors off the shared-world industry and went on to write numerous popular\
  \ creator-owned series, from his Spearwielder's Tales to the Crimson Shadow stories.\
  \ His piece in <i><a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy80ht\">Worlds of Their Own</a></i>,\
  \ \"Mather's Blood,\" is set in the world of Corona, home of his DemonWars saga.\
  \ Check it out:</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p> On one of those gusts came a cry\
  \ of anguish that sliced the heart of Mather Wyndon, a scream of pain and fear from\
  \ a voice that he knew well. </p>\n     <p> He drew out his sword and used it to\
  \ lead the way through the tangle of branch and snow, pushing out into the frigid\
  \ air, trying to orient himself and determine the direction of Bradwarden's howl.\
  \ The wind was from the northeast still, and it had carried Bradwarden's cry, so\
  \ Mather set out that way, circumventing Dundalis, the smoke of the many chimneys\
  \ thick in the air. Soon he found a path cut through the drifts—by goblins, he knew,\
  \ though he could hardly see on this dark night. He didn't dare light a torch, fearing\
  \ to make himself a target, but he understood his disadvantage here. Goblins were\
  \ creatures of caves and deep tunnels. They could see much better in the dark than\
  \ even an elven-trained ranger.</p> \n     <p> Mather was not surprised when he\
  \ came through one large drift and caught a flicker of movement to the side, a missile\
  \ flying straight for him. </p>\n     <p> He sent his energy into Tempest, and the\
  \ sword flared with angry light. He brought the blade whipping about, intercepting\
  \ the hurled spear and knocking it harmlessly aside, and then slashed back, deflecting\
  \ a second.</p> \n     <p> The third got through...</p> \n    </blockquote> \n \
  \   <p><b>Michael A. Stackpole</b> is probably best known for his wildly popular\
  \ X-Wing: Rogue Squadron series, which breathed new life into the most famous pilots\
  \ of the Star Wars universe. He's also done work for Battletech, has numerous creator-owned\
  \ projects such as the DragonCrown War and the Age of Discovery series, and in 2008\
  \ had an asteroid named after him. This story, \"Keeping Score,\" is set in his\
  \ Purgatory Station universe:</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>The ambush seared\
  \ scarlet light through the mauve jungle. Sara had felt it coming a heartbeat before\
  \ beams flicked out—things had gotten too quiet for a second. The enemy fire manifested\
  \ as full shafts of light instantly linking shooter and target, then snapping off,\
  \ since light traveled far too fast for even the most augmented eyes to see it as\
  \ tiny bolts. Ruby spears stabbed down from high branches, or slanted in from around\
  \ the boles of trees, here and there, as the Zsytzii warriors shifted impossibly\
  \ fast through the jungle.</p> \n     <p> Sara cut left and spun, slamming her back\
  \ against the trunk of a tree. Her body armor absorbed most of the impact and she\
  \ continued to spin, then dropped to a knee on the far side of the tree and brought\
  \ her LNT-87 carbine up. The green crosshairs on her combat glasses tracked along\
  \ with the weapon's muzzle, showing her where it was pointed. The top barrel stabbed\
  \ red back at the ambushers, burning little holes through broad leaves and striping\
  \ trunks with carbonized scars. Fire gouted from the lower barrel as chemical explosives\
  \ launched clouds of little flechettes at the unseen attackers.</p> \n     <p> To\
  \ her right Captain Patrick Kelloch, the fire team's leader, laid down a pattern\
  \ of raking fire that covered their right flank while she concentrated on the left.\
  \ Flechettes shredded leaves and vaporized plump, purple lotla fruit. She thought\
  \ she saw a black shadow splashed with green, and hoped one fewer laser was targeted\
  \ back at her, but the Zsytzii were harder to hit than she'd ever found in virtsims.</p>\
  \ \n     <p> Bragb Bissik, the team's heavy-weapons specialist, stepped into the\
  \ gap between the two human warriors. Underslung on his massive right forearm were\
  \ the eight spinning rotary-barrels of the Gatling-style Bouganshi laser cannon.\
  \ Into each barrel was fed a small lasing cell, consisting of a chemical reagent\
  \ that released a lot of energy really fast. The cell converted that energy into\
  \ coherent light of great power and intensity that blazed for almost a second once\
  \ the reaction had been started. The cannon whined as the barrels spun. The red\
  \ beams slashed in an arc, nipping branches from trees and burning fire into the\
  \ jungle's upper reaches.</p> \n     <p> The weapon spat the smoking lasing cells\
  \ out into a pile at the hulking Bouganshi's feet. The brilliant red beams bathed\
  \ him in bloody highlight. Hulking and broad-shouldered, the Bouganshi could have\
  \ been a demon from any number of human pantheons, and Sara hoped the Zeez would\
  \ find him purely terrifying.</p> \n     <p> As Bragb's fire raked the higher branches,\
  \ two beams stabbed out from the ground to hit the Bouganshi's broad chest...</p>\
