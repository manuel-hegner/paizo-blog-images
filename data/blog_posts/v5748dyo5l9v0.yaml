  \ Around! Part II</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, February 10, 2009</p> \n\
  \    <p>Greetings, fellow Paizonians! Last week, Hank Woon and I upgraded our messageboard\
  \ status from \"Pathfinder Subscriber\" to \"Editorial Assistant\"—that's right,\
  \ we're the newest interns here at Paizo!</p> \n    <p>I'm David Eitelbach, and\
  \ I'm as excited (or more so) as many of you probably imagine I would be to get\
  \ a gig at Paizo. At 23 years old, I'm the youngest member of the Paizo team. My\
  \ glorious years at college came to an end just as the economy flushed itself down\
  \ the toilet, so without a job and the prospects of finding a career looking dim,\
  \ I applied for the editorial internship —hoping beyond hope that Paizo would want\
  \ me as badly as I wanted to work for them. If I was going to spending my copious\
  \ amounts of free time reading <i>Pathfinder</i> anyway, why not do it at Paizo\
  \ and get some editing experience under my belt? Amazingly (it seemed to me), I\
  \ got the job... er, internship.</p> \n    <p>When I stepped into the Paizo offices\
  \ for the first time, I finally understood how Charlie must have felt as he explored\
  \ Willy Wonka's chocolate factory—there are roleplaying goodies everywhere! Every\
  \ staff member's desk is piled high with toys; they have a mammoth collection of\
  \ pulp science fiction and fantasy books, including original, tattered anthologies\
  \ of every issue of <i>Amazing Stories</i> (it doesn't get more exciting than that\
  \ for an H. P. Lovecraft fan); the shelves of their library are lined with dozens\
  \ upon dozens of RPG products (including, to my glee, two Forgotten Realms Grey\
  \ Boxes); and awesome Wayne Reynolds' cover art for upcoming Pathfinder Chronicles\
  \ books are tacked to cubicle walls. I was in heaven.</p> \n    <p>That feeling\
  \ of elation? Yeah, it's still here, a week later. This is the only time in my memory\
  \ when I've been sad to leave work and excited to come in the next day. I spend\
  \ my hours at the office reading and editing the <i>Pathfinder</i> articles I used\
  \ to pore over during my free time, and I'm proud to help make Paizo products the\
  \ best in the industry. Plus, I get free copies of all of their products, which\
  \ is the very definition of awesome.</p> \n    <p>I have great plans for the blog:\
  \ creating Paizo's very own \"Appendix N,\" spotlight articles on various regions\
  \ of Golarion with tips for sandbox-style of play, Planet Stories tie-ins to <i>Pathfinder</i>,\
  \ and generally talking about the cool things that happen around the office. After\
  \ all, interning at Paizo is my nerd-dream come true, and everyone else should have\
  \ a chance to see just how awesome it is!</p> \n    <p>David Eitelbach<br> Paizo\
  \ Editorial Intern</p> \n   </blockquote> <!-- tags: Interns --> \n  </div> <a href=\"\
