  > \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">I can't believe it's already Friday, which\
  \ means it's time for another installment of the Friday Publisher Preview! I'm still\
  \ a bit giddy from our recent in-office review of the paint masters for November's\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9er4\"><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a> set of prepainted\
  \ plastic <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder Battles</a> miniatures. The\
  \ set looks absolutely fantastic, and I couldn't be happier with the communications\
  \ and production standards WizKids and Paizo have been able to achieve with this\
  \ set. It really feels like we are firing on all cylinders at the moment, and I'm\
  \ thrilled to think of what the future has in store.</p> \n     <p>We've spent some\
  \ time recently focusing on the NPCs, townfolk, and bar denizens of the set, so\
  \ this time around I wanted to get back to the monsters. In this caseâ€”bugbears!</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Since the very start, I've had a personal goal to have at least one\
  \ kind of \"focus creature\" per set. My experience shows that if you can get multiple\
  \ figures of one type (say, orcs, goblins, and the like) in the same set, paint\
  \ application and sculpt details tend to be more consistent. For this set, my focus\
  \ creatures are ghouls (most of which we've previewed already) and bugbears (most\
  \ of which we haven't).</p> \n     <p>I previewed the <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lhkh\"\
  >Bugbear Tyrant</a> back in June. This week, I'd like to show some of his companion\
  \ bugbears. A tyrant isn't a tyrant without someone to boss around, after all.</p>\
  \ \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150911-BugbearLurker.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150911-BugbearLurker_360.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>Up first this week is the brutish Bugbear Lurker, whose image\
  \ comes from the opening illustration of the bugbear section of the <a href=\"/products/btpy9926\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder RPG Monster Codex</em></a>. His statistics appear on page 25 of\
  \ that volume. Bugbear Lurkers double as any kind of nasty bugbear menace, so I\
  \ decided to slot this guy into the common rarity to help you build up a small gang\
  \ of them. The Bugbear Lurker is a Medium figure.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n      <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150911-BugbearMystic.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150911-BugbearMystic_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Next is the Bugbear Mystic, our take on the bugbear\
  \ bloodmage from page 26 of the <a href=\"/products/btpy9926\"><em>Monster Codex</em></a>.\
  \ It's also a goal of mine to create both male and female figures for all the major\
  \ humanoid races, and in this case the Monster Codex has been something of a godsend\
  \ in terms of art reference. The Bugbear Mystic is also a Medium common, all the\
  \ better for building a little bestial cult of your very own.</p> \n     <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150911-BugbearFleshGlutton.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150911-BugbearFleshGlutton_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Perhaps my favorite bugbear in <a href=\"/products/btpy9er4\"\
  ><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a> is the Bugbear Flesh Glutton, from page 22 of\
  \ the <a href=\"/products/btpy9926\"><em>Monster Codex</em></a>. These unruly beasts\
  \ so love the taste of intelligent creatures that they have grown to a disgustingly\
  \ large size. The Bugbear Flesh Glutton is a Large, uncommon figure, perfect for\
  \ peppering your growing bugbear brood with a few loutish brutes.</p> \n     <p>These\
  \ three bugbears add to the Bugbear Tyrant to flesh out the Pathfinder bugbear ranks\
  \ (which also includes a base common Bugbear Warrior from <a href=\"/products/btpy909j\"\
  ><em>Legends of Golarion</em></a> and the bow-wielding Bugbear Hero from way back\
  \ in the <a href=\"/products/btpy8rqs\"><em>Rise of the Runelords</em></a> set.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>What other humanoid \"focus creatures\" would you like to see in future\
  \ sets? Drop some suggestions in the comments and we'll chat about it until next\
  \ week, when I return with another batch of previews from <a href=\"/products/btpy9er4\"\
