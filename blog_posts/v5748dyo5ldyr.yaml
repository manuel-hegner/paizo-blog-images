  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">Wails\
  \ regularly echo through the eastern wing of Gravecharge, Pharasma's cathedral in\
  \ the university city of Lepidstadt. Yet such aren't the breathless screams of the\
  \ dead that so often ring through the corners of Ustalav, but rather the cries of\
  \ life. Since its construction, Gravecharge has maintained a clean and well-supervised\
  \ hospice for sick and orphaned youths. Just as the goddess Pharasma concerns herself\
  \ with the transition of life to death, so does she cherish even the most tragic\
  \ lives.</span></p> \n    <p>Imrijka came to Gravecharge in the arms of a city watchman,\
  \ wrapped in a tattered uniform and held at arm's length. The guard claimed his\
  \ patrol had found \"the thing\" during their dawn patrol to the Spiral Cromlech,\
  \ a Kellid ruin overlooking the city that was notorious for ill fortune and mysterious\
  \ disappearances—but never for mysterious appearances. Hearing a babe bawling amid\
  \ the moon-bleached standing stones, the guards bold enough to investigate momentarily\
  \ took her for some stray fiend-child and almost slew her amid the eerie ruins.\
  \ Identifying her as a half-orc infant did little to stay the hands of those ready\
  \ to mete out death, but the argument that matters of life and death should be left\
  \ to Pharasma sheathed the blades of those not truly eager to spill a child's blood—\
  regardless of the color of her skin.</p> \n    <p>Dubbed Imrijka after Gravecharge's\
  \ first high priestess, Imrijka Castavelik, the pistachio-skinned girl was cleaned,\
  \ clothed, and given a place among the cathedral's other orphans. At first she terrified\
  \ those youths, being larger, stronger, and more vicious in her biting than some\
  \ children double her age. But only for a time. The priestesses of Pharasma explained\
  \ the mysteries of their goddess's will and the vastness and variety of her creations,\
  \ teaching the children that they were blessed to have such a unique new sister.\
  \ For a time, behind the cathedral's walls, that was even the truth.</p> \n    <div\

  \     <br> Illstruation by Wayne Reynolds\n    </div> \n    <p>When she was old\
  \ enough to understand and be understood, Imrijka reported to the offices of Jarlos\
  \ Teym, Gravecharge's high exorcist, for the first time. He asked her a great deal\
  \ about her life, how she felt about her studies, the clergy, the other children,\
  \ and if there was anything he could do to make things more comfortable for her.\
  \ A shy girl, Imrijka declined. Subsequent discussions bent toward the future, Imrijka's\
  \ dreams, her prayers, and her vision for a long life. Finally, though, after months\
  \ of building a rapport with the girl, Teym asked about her past. But for Imrijka,\
  \ life began with the cathedral, priestesses, and other orphans. Teym pressed, insisting\
  \ on answers, even verifying them with magic. After one particularly intense interview,\
  \ a confused Imrijka finally started asking her own questions: Why did it matter?\
  \ Why did Teym care? Couldn't what she might be outweigh what she might have been?</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Deeming her mature enough to know, Teym explained his tenacity: someone\
  \ had come to adopt Imrijka. Thrice. Every Kuthona for the past 3 years. First came\
  \ a man dressed like a count's footman, articulate and with more questions than\
  \ answers. He left after raising the clergy's suspicions with his too-pointed inquiries\
  \ about Imrijka. A year later he returned, this time with a human woman of vulpine\
  \ beauty who claimed to be Imrijka's mother—though her apparent age made that only\
  \ the barest possibility. It was Teym's own suspicions and skill at discerning lies\
  \ that kept the strangers from Imrijka, and the unusual pair left with wordless\
  \ detachment. Finally, only a few months past—days before Teym's first meeting with\
  \ Imrijka—the two strangers returned, led by a man dressed in white and silver.\
  \ The bold newcomer spoke as one used to being obeyed and demanded Imrijka be handed\
  \ over to him. Teym personally denied him, insisting to know what right he had to\
  \ the girl. A father's right, the man persisted. The high exorcist ordered them\
  \ out of the cathedral in that instant, but before they obeyed the man in white\
  \ smiled. \"She's not like us,\" he said, eyes glimmering. \"Excellent.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>Despite Teym's explanation, Imrijka understood only that her parents had\
  \ come for her and that the high exorcist had sent them away. She held back both\
  \ questions and tears, nodding blankly until Teym excused her. But she didn't return\
  \ to her room. Rather, she exited through the front doors of Gravecharge and out\
  \ onto the snowy streets—where someone waited.</p> \n    <p>A man in white sat upon\
  \ the icy benches of the nearby circle, slowly feeding bits of shredded meat to\
  \ the crows. Seeing Imrijka enter the plaza through the flurry of sound-deadening\
  \ snow, he rose and walked toward her. Wary, she approached. In his gloved hand\
  \ appeared a strange token, a disk etched with barbaric symbols and a figure impaled\
  \ upon a spear. She reached for it.</p> \n    <p>A merciless iron arrow shattered\
  \ the man's hand, sending the strange icon spiraling into the snow. Teym stood across\
  \ the circle, another arrow nocked in his bent hawthorn bow. Around him whipped\
  \ the black-edged crimson of Pharasma's inquisitors, woven flames that engulfed\
  \ any flakes the whirling wind blew against them. \"Back, girl,\" he commanded in\
  \ a voice Imrijka had never heard him use.</p> \n    <p>The man in white might have\
  \ been carved of ice. He had never flinched. Though the icon was knocked away, a\
  \ tangle of disjoined fingers and bloodless flesh-ribbons remained outstretched\
  \ toward Imrijka. Her small tusks clattered against her teeth, but she didn't scream.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Another time, dear,\" the man whispered, just for her. Then the snow\
  \ whirled around him. For a moment he seemed to be one with the cold, a blizzard-born\
  \ prince. Then he was gone, leaving Imrijka cold and frightened—but not alone. High\
  \ Exorcist Teym's cloak around her was heavy, and warm, and smelled strongly of\
  \ tobacco and dust—what Imrijka imagined a grandfather should smell like. It didn't\
  \ smell anything like the man in white.</p> \n    <p>Until Imrijka reached maturity\
  \ and was fully able to defend herself, she rarely left Gravecharge Cathedral. When\
  \ finally she did, it was in the crimson and black of an initiate inquisitor of\
  \ Pharasma's faith. Even after the retirement of High Exorcist Teym, she continued\
  \ to serve the church and the man she'd adopted as her grandfather, assisting him\
  \ in his more scholarly pursuits as a consultant on religious antiquities at the\
  \ University of Lepidstadt. She's traveled much of Ustalav and beyond—guarded an\
  \ expedition to the boney towers of Kalexcourt, spent a night in the haunted hotel\
  \ known as House Beumhal, been shouted off the porch of retired monster hunter Ailson\
  \ Kinder (but not before getting her copy of <i>Hunter's Moon</i> signed), and had\
  \ numerous other adventures. She regularly returns to Gravecharge, where several\
  \ of her childhood companions have grown into positions within the church's sphere\
  \ of influence—including Brel Vhalsik, an argumentative Kellid theologian with whom\
  \ she shares a complicated relationship. But increasingly her interests and Teym's\
  \ research send her beyond Ustalav's borders, where she treads with her goddess's\
  \ blessing, bringing judgment to all who would violate the laws of life and death.\
  \ In her travels she's faced significant prejudice, but tales of Pharasma's \"monster\
  \ monster-hunter\" and Imrijka's ever-present arsenal convince most bigots to keep\
  \ their fool mouths firmly shut. Through it all, she's never seen the man in white\
  \ again—at least, not with total confidence, as there have been far too many shadows\
  \ and half-recognized faces to be sure. She recovered his strange gift on that snowy\
  \ day and wears the disk openly, hoping that someone someday might recognize it\
  \ and lead her to some hint of where she came from and who she was. But for now,\
  \ the future holds far greater promises for Imrijka, and she strides into it boldly,\
  \ confident in her faith, where she's going, and who she is.</p> \n    <p>F. Wesley\
