  \ who peppers his blogs with puns and ridiculous word plays, often dessert-based?\
  \ Does it bother you so much that you fantasize about stabbing him in the back,\
  \ but federal and local statutes (along with those pesky pangs of morality) stop\
  \ you? Well, I have good news! You can play a rogue and take out your frustrations\
  \ on your friend's monsters!</p> \n     <p>Last week, Jason presented a preview\
  \ of the Pathfinder Second Edition fighter class, giving you a peek into our process\
  \ when designing classes for the new game. This week, I am happy to present the\
  \ fighter's favorite combat companion—the rogue!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb360\"\

  ></a> \n      <p><i>Illustration by Wayne Reynolds</i></p>\n     </div> \n     <p>The\
  \ design goals for the rogue were simple: she had to be nimble, skillful, and able\
  \ to take full advantage when enemies are unaware. The new class design achieves\
  \ this through a mix of classic and new mechanics.</p> \n     <h2>Rogue Features</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>I'm sure it will surprise no one that the first class feature the rogue\
  \ gets is sneak attack. It works much like you would expect, granting extra d6s\
  \ of precision damage when she strikes a flat-footed foe. Flanking a foe is the\
  \ easiest way for the rogue to make her foe flat-footed, but at 1st level, she also\
  \ gets the surprise attack feature. Thanks to surprise attack, during the first\
  \ round of combat, the rogue treats any creature that has not taken its turn yet\
  \ as if it were flat-footed.</p> \n     <p>But wait, there's more! In addition to\
  \ dealing extra damage when attacking flat-footed foes, at 9th level the rogue also\
  \ applies debilitating strikes to such attacks, allowing her to entangle or enfeeble\
  \ her foes on top of the normal punishment. As her level rises, she has the opportunity\
  \ to expand the conditions applied with debilitating strikes and increase the number\
  \ of conditions applied, leading up to a potential instant kill with her Master\
  \ Strike at 19th level.</p> \n     <p>So, the rogue is a ruthless combatant bringing\
  \ pain and misery to her foes, but that's only half of the story. She is also a\
  \ master of skills. Not only does she gain training and proficiency increases in\
  \ more skills than other classes, but she gains skill feats at an accelerated rate\
  \ (one per level instead of one every other level). And while Deception, Stealth,\
  \ and Thievery and all of the skill feats attached to those iconic rogue skills\
  \ may seem like obvious choices, the rogue's mastery of a wide variety of skills\
  \ makes her one of the most versatile classes in the game—her breadth of knowledge\
  \ and abilities means she's extremely useful in every mode of play.</p> \n     <p>If\
  \ you want to play a dungeon-delving rogue, stock up on skill feats expanding on\
  \ Acrobatics, Athletics, Stealth, and Deception to gain skill feats that let you\
  \ do things like kip up from prone for free, jump from wall to wall, and move stealthily\
  \ at full speed. If you want to be a savvy con artist bilking the rich and vain,\
  \ focus on Deception, Diplomacy, Performance, and Society. If you want to play a\
  \ fence or burglar with a semblance of respectability, focus on Crafting, Intimidation,\
  \ and the like. Your options are so rich that you can easily create a mix of these\
  \ types of rogues and many further variations.</p> \n     <h2>Rogue Feats</h2> \n\
  \     <p>Bridging the gap between the murderous and the skillful are the various\
  \ class feats available to the rogue. The few of you lucky enough to playtest the\
  \ rogue at Gary Con X or the GAMA Trade Show became acquainted with Nimble Dodge,\
  \ a reaction that increases the rogue's Armor Class by 2 at a whim. And that's pretty\
  \ cool, but the rogue's tricks don't stop there. At 2nd level, a rogue could take\
  \ Mobility, allowing her to move at half her speed and ignore all sorts of reactions\
  \ triggered by movement, such as attacks of opportunity. And at 4th level, there's\
  \ a rogue feat called Reactive Pursuit, which allows the rogue—as a reaction—to\
  \ chase after foes trying to disengage from her constant stabbings.</p> \n     <p>Avoiding\
  \ attacks and getting into position are all fine and dandy, but occasionally rogues\
  \ have a hard time lining up flanking. The 4th-level feat Dread Striker allows you\
  \ to treat frightened creatures as flat-footed, which is pretty good, but if you\
  \ want even greater flexibility for positioning, check out Gang Up at 6th level.\
  \ That feat allows you to treat an enemy as flat-footed when it's within the melee\
  \ reach of you and one of your allies, no matter your positioning. If that's not\
  \ good enough, wait until 14th level, when you can take Instant Opening—with a few\
  \ choice words or a rude gesture, you can make a single creature within 30 feet\
  \ flat-footed to your attacks until the end of your next turn.</p> \n     <p>Rogues\
  \ are slippery characters, both physically and mentally. Cognitive Loophole lets\
  \ the rogue ignore a mental effect for a round before it fully takes hold. At 16th\
  \ level, a rogue can parlay her proficiency in Deception to become a Blank Slate,\
  \ which makes her immune to detection, revelation, and scrying effects.</p> \n \
  \    <p>Of course, many of the rogue's class feats also increase her fighting potential.\
  \ One of my favorites is the 6th-level feat Twist the Knife. With this feat, as\
  \ long as you have just hit a foe and applied your sneak attack damage, you can\
  \ apply persistent bleed damage equal to half your current sneak attack dice. That's\
  \ sure going to leave a mark.</p> \n     <p>All this has only scratched the surface\
  \ of the rogue. In the end, this class is a toolbox of tricks, cunning, and mayhem,\
  \ adaptable to a variety of situations in and out of combat. Its design allows you\
  \ to focus on the kind of rogue you want to play, from a ruthless slayer who infiltrates\
  \ dungeons to a swindler charming away coin from gullible townsfolk, or even a hard-boiled\
  \ hunter of fugitives. It's up to you!</p> \n     <p>Stephen Radney-MacFarland<br>\
