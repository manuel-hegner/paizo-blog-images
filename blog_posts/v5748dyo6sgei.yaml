  \ </div> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">With the release of the <a href=\"/starfinderplaytest\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Character Operations Manual</em> Playtest</a>, the <a href=\"/starfindersociety\"\
  >Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild</a> is also opening its doors to a limited\
  \ form of playtest. Since these classes won't be released until late 2019, we're\
  \ looking at allowing players the chance to try these classes out during the playtest\
  \ period.</p> \n    <p><b>Playtest Period</b>: The availability for these rules\
  \ runs from the publishing of this post until the end of the playtest period (<b>January\
  \ 16th, 2019</b>.) Once this period has expired, players can no longer use the <em>Starfinder\
  \ Character Operations Manual</em> Playtest classes until the publication of the\
  \ book in late 2019.</p> \n    <p><b>How It Works</b>: Given the smaller volume\
  \ of scenarios that Starfinder Society has compared to Pathfinder Society, we've\
  \ elected not to force players to choose between playtesting new classes on new\
  \ characters or ignoring the playtest to continue with existing characters. As a\
  \ happy medium between these options, we're opening up Society play for the playtest\
  \ classes via the use of custom created characters that operate much like our pregenerated\
  \ characters. We believe this should encourage players to test the waters with custom\
  \ builds, be it with current scenarios or through our growing stable of repeatable\
  \ options.</p> \n    <p><b>Creating a Playtest Character</b>: Prior to playing a\
  \ scenario in the playtest period, a player can determine if they want to playtest\
  \ one of the new classes. Depending on the tier of the scenario, the player can\
  \ then use a 1st-, 4th- or 8th-level character using one of the classes in the <em>Starfinder\
  \ Character Operations Manual</em> Playtest and created using the following guidelines:</p>\
  \ \n    <ul>\n     <li><b>Classes</b>: The character must have all levels in a single\
  \ playtest class. Although multiclassing ramifications are important for the playtest\
  \ as a whole, we're keeping to single classes in the organized play portion of the\
  \ playtest for simplicity.</li> \n     <li><b>1st Level</b>: The character can be\
  \ created using the character creation rules presented in the <em>Starfinder Core\
  \ Rulebook</em> and <em>Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild Guide</em>.</li> \n\
  \     <li><b>4th Level</b>: This character follows the same rules as above, except\
  \ it can select one 4th level armor or weapon and one 3rd level armor or weapon.\
  \ In addition, the player can spend up to 4,000 credits on other available equipment.</li>\
  \ \n     <li><b>8th Level</b>: This character follows the same rules as above, except\
  \ it can select one 8th level armor or weapon and one 7th level armor or weapon.\
  \ In addition, the player can spend up to 18,000 credits on other available equipment.</li>\n\
  \    </ul> \n    <p><b>Credit</b>: The credit earned for playing a playtest character\
  \ follows the same rules and guidelines as presented on page 7 of the <em>Starfinder\
  \ Society Roleplaying Guild Guide</em>. This means that you must choose which of\
  \ your characters will receive the credit at the beginning of the adventure. Credit\
  \ must be assigned to characters of lower level than the playtest character.</p>\
  \ \n    <p><b>Resolving Conditions</b>: We recognize that players taking the opportunity\
  \ to playtest these characters are performing a service for the game and campaign.\
  \ As a result, whenever a player playtests a 4th- or 8th-level version of these\
  \ characters, the cost to purchase a raise dead is reduced to 6 Fame and subsequent\
  \ restorations to remove the negative levels are only 1 Fame each. This means that\
  \ there's still some risk to your established characters, but the penalty for dying\
  \ as a playtest character is far less onerous than it would be for a normal character\
  \ or pregenerated character.</p> \n    <p><b>Applying Credit</b>: As we want to\
  \ encourage extra play of the higher-level versions of these classes, we're also\
  \ going to open up the rules for applying credit when playing a playtest character.\
  \ A player using a non-1st-level playtest character may choose to apply the earned\
  \ Chronicle sheet to an existing Organized Play character. To do so, simply replace\
  \ the credits earned on the Chronicle sheet with credits from the list below that\
  \ match the level range of the existing player character.</p> \n    <ul>\n     <li><b>Levels\
  \ 1-2</b>: 720 credits (2,160 credits for Adventure Path module)</li> \n     <li><b>Levels\
  \ 3-4</b>: 1,460 credits (4,380 credits for Adventure Path module)</li> \n     <li><b>Levels\
  \ 5-6</b>: 4,085 credits (12,255 credits for Adventure Path module)</li> \n    \
  \ <li><b>Levels 7-8</b>: 5,835 credits (17,505 credits for Adventure Path module)</li>\n\
  \    </ul> \n    <p><b>Shields</b>: As a special note, the availability of shields,\
  \ as presented with the vanguard class, are available for all playtest characters\
  \ (biohacker, vanguard and witchwarper) to try out. However, shields cannot be purchased\
  \ for other organized play characters.</p> \n    <p>With all this in mind, we encourage\
  \ our players to take an active part in the playtest, both by sharing your opinions\
  \ online in the <a href=\"/community/forums/starfinder/playtest\">Playtest forums</a>\
  \ and by <a href=\"/starfinderplaytest\">completing the playtest surveys</a>. We\
  \ hope that by opening up the means in which players can create and customize characters\
  \ for the playtest, that we can see some unique and fun builds using these new classes\
  \ and that such tests will provide the design team with priceless \"field agent\"\
  \ feedback!</p> \n    <p>I look forward to hearing from each of you about your experiences\
  \ with the <em>Starfinder Character Operations Manual</em> classes and am even more\
  \ excited to see these classes join the roster of Starfinder classes officially\
  \ in late 2019.</p> \n    <p>Thurston Hillman<br> <i>Starfinder Society Developer</i></p>\
