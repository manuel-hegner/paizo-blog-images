  \    <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Greetings, ‘Finders! We’re\
  \ excited to join our Latine contributors in celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month,\
  \ which runs from September 15th – October 15th here in the United States of America!\
  \ Since 1988, this cultural heritage month has celebrated Hispanic and Latine contributions\
  \ to culture, science, history, and art!</p>\n      <p>This year’s theme is “Pioneers\
  \ of Change: Shaping the Future”—a focus on Hispanic and Latine people paving the\
  \ way for future generations. As part of our call for contributors, we asked folks\
  \ who those pioneers were in their own lives!</p>\n      <p>But enough from me.\
  \ Let me turn it over to some of our lovely Latine writers!</p>\n      <br>\n  \

  \ Blomquist (he/him)</h3>\n      <p>¿Qué es la que hay? For those who don’t know\
  \ me, I’m Joe, a Nuyorican freelancer known for scene-stealing ambiance and annoyingly\
  \ attractive NPCs (just ask my devs). But today I get to talk about one of the pillars\
  \ in my family: my granduncle, Rudy.</p><a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/59b0470c-1450-4de8-b011-4b715adaf322/rudy-hernandez-pic4.jpg\"\

  \ style=\"font-size: 13px;\"></p>\n      <p>In 1960, the Washington Senators (eventually\
  \ the Minnesota Twins) signed the first Dominican-born pitcher in Major League Baseball,\
  \ Rudy Hernández (beating Juan Marichal by two weeks). Rudy grew up in New York,\
  \ with our family avoiding much of Trujillo’s reign in the Dominican Republic (despite\
  \ a few of El Jefe’s diplomats coming from our family). In those days, most of the\
  \ Dominican and Puerto Rican players were close, playing in the Caribbean winter\
  \ leagues, and it was his friend, Roberto Clemente, who finally convinced Rudy to\
  \ become a pitcher. After pitching for both incarnations of the Washington Senators,\
  \ Rudy continued in Triple-A baseball throughout the 60s. Eventually, he became\
  \ a scout for the Orioles and Cubs and returned to Puerto Rico to coach for the\
  \ Department of Sports and Recreation, for Orlando Cepeda’s baseball school, and\
  \ to run his own baseball camp in San Juan. He passed in 2022.</p>\n      <p>Baseball\
  \ wasn’t my sport, but that never mattered to Tío Rudy. For as little time as I\
  \ got to spend with him, his tireless cultivation of Caribbean Latine talent for\
  \ the sport he loved inspired my own desires to help grow our community with new\
  \ and diverse voices. He taught me to persevere despite setbacks and how to set\
  \ my goals high while still being flexible enough to change the game as needed.</p>\n\

  \      </div>\n      <br>\n      <h3>Carlos Cabrera (he/they)</h3>\n      <p>Hi\
  \ everyone! For this year’s theme, I wanted to focus on the person who helped set\
  \ me on my path: my late father.</p>\n      <p>To begin, I can say I definitely\
  \ got my sense of humor from him. We are a mixed-race family, and he used to say\
  \ that he was Cornucopian because he was so many things and that he came from Cornucopia.\
  \ In my childhood, I grew up with a younger sister and two older brothers. It wasn’\
  t until much later that I found out I had even more siblings, but back when it was\
  \ just the four of us, my brothers and I each had a separate video game console.\
  \ I had an Intellivision, Felipe had a Vectrex, and Esteban (we all call him Rico)\
  \ had a Colecovision. Later, when I upgraded to an NES and then the SEGA Genesis,\
  \ I found the game that made me decide what I wanted to do with my life— <em>Flashback:\
  \ The Quest for Identity</em> (womp womp).</p>\n      <p>There’s a lot I wish I\
  \ could show my dad nowadays, but most importantly of all, I want to tell him that\
  \ it worked. At least part-time, anyway. I’m sure for him it would be more than\
  \ enough.</p>\n      <br>\n      <center>\n       <hr width=\"75%\">\n      </center>\n\
  \      <br>\n      <p>We welcome our Hispanic and Latine community members to share\
  \ their stories in the comments!</p>\n      <p>In solidarity,</p>\n      <p style=\"\
