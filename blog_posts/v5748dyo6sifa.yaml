  \    </div> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">It’s that time\
  \ of year where company presidents look into the future, comparing what it costs\
  \ to produce and create game products today versus what it did last year–and how\
  \ those costs will change in the year to come. No one likes to raise prices, but\
  \ doing so is a necessity. Paizo is not immune to economic factors like inflation,\
  \ nor industry-wide fluctuations in cost-of-goods, labor, or shipping and logistics,\
  \ and we must periodically adjust our prices to reflect rising costs. Let’s break\
  \ things down.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/a9350a71-428c-45a3-9ed3-2321e68c5fb1/PZO2113RageofElements_PZO7121PortsofCall_1920.png\"\

  \ \n     </div> \n     <h2>Bounties, Quests, and Scenarios (PDF)</h2> \n     <p>Bounties\
  \ and Quests are standalone short digital adventures, usually designed to be played\
  \ for up to 2 hours. We’ll be increasing the price of these from $4.99 to $5.99.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Society scenarios are adventures suitable for a single gaming session\
  \ of around 4-5 hours. Many are part of an overarching theme for a particular year,\
  \ so it’s possible to weave an entire campaign out of these scenarios one session\
  \ at a time. Currently, scenarios are priced at $5.99 for “regular” scenarios and\
  \ $7.99 for higher-level scenarios, which are generally longer and take longer to\
  \ develop and edit. Very soon, we will standardize the price for ALL Society scenarios\
  \ (regardless of level) to $8.99. Special “interactive” scenarios will increase\
  \ from $14.99 to $19.99.</p> \n     <p>These price changes will be retroactive for\
  \ all previously released products as of October 25th. If you have some gaps in\
  \ your collection going back to the very beginning of Pathfinder Society in 2007,\
  \ you may wish to backfill your collection before these new prices go into effect.</p>\
  \ \n     <h3>Other PDF Products</h3> \n     <p>We don’t plan any other PDF price\
  \ changes beyond <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6si5r?Paizo-PDF-Pricing-Changes\"\
  >what we announced last year</a>.</p> \n     <h2>Price Changes</h2> \n     <p>We\
  \ will be increasing prices on accessories, softcover, and hardcover books. The\
  \ amount of this increase varies by product type, but here are some examples.</p>\
  \ \n     <ul> \n      <li>Flip-Mats: $19.99 (+$3)</li> \n      <li>Flip-Mat Multi-Pack:\
  \ $29.99 (+$5)</li> \n      <li>96-page Adventure Paths: $29.99 (+$3)</li> \n  \
  \    <li>Pocket Editions will range in price from $26.99 to $34.99 based on page\
  \ count.</li> \n      <li>Hardcover prices will vary in price based on page count.\
  \ That might seem obvious, but it’s a change from us keeping MSRP the same across\
  \ wide page counts. Here are a couple of baseline examples. \n       <ul> \n   \
  \     <li>128-page: $44.99</li> \n        <li>192-page: $59.99</li> \n        <li>256-page:\
  \ $69.99</li> \n        <li>304-page plus map: $79.99</li> \n        <li>Special\
  \ Edition covers add an additional $20 to the retail price.</li> \n       </ul>\
  \ </li> \n     </ul> \n     <p>You’ll see the above price changes reflected in products\
  \ that begin releasing in April of 2024, as well as reprints of older products.</p>\
  \ \n     <h2>Holding the Line on the Core</h2> \n     <p>Contrary to what I’ve outlined\
  \ above, we’ll keep the price of the hardcover Core books (<a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02ej2\"\
  >Player Core</a>, <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02eok?Pathfinder-GM-Core\"\
  >GM Core</a>, <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02ej4?Pathfinder-Monster-Core\"\
  >Monster Core</a>, and <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02ej5/discuss?Pathfinder-Player-Core-2\"\
  >Player Core 2</a>) at $59.99 through at least the first printing. We feel these\
  \ books are essential first purchases for Pathfinder players and want to hold the\
  \ line on price increases as long as possible to reduce the barrier of entry for\
  \ new players.</p> \n     <h2>Paizo and the Environment</h2> \n     <p>For years,\
  \ Paizo has printed our products using ecologically friendly soy-based ink rather\
  \ than petroleum or other vegetable-based inks. Soy ink results in richer and more\
  \ vibrant colors that require less ink on every page. We’ll definitely keep soy\
  \ inks in Paizo products, but I wanted you to know about it, since it’s not something\
  \ we’ve made a big deal about or discussed in the past.</p> \n     <p>What is new\
  \ is that we’re changing to FSC-certified paper. This means that the paper Paizo\
  \ uses will come from ecologically sourced forests that prohibit deforestation (replacing\
  \ the trees they harvest with new growth), require biodiversity and old forests\
  \ to be protected, protect the rights of Indigenous Peoples, and ensure that Paizo\
  \ has a sustainable source of paper for many years to come. To learn about the Forest\
  \ Stewardship Council or delve into the certification process <a href=\"https://fsc.org/en\"\
  >visit their website</a>.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/7c27d25e-64ce-4722-a04b-8d0d393f65d8/FSC.jpg\"\

  \   <p>Paizo is not switching to recycled paper, which is significantly more expensive\
  \ and has a vastly different look and feel. FSC paper is a mix of new and recycled\
  \ paper, and you won’t be able to tell the difference between new products and old\
  \ ones without looking for the FSC label.</p> \n     <p>We’re making changes in\
  \ shipping supplies as well. We’ve switched to using starch peanuts and air pockets\
  \ in store shipments. We’re also phasing out the use of foam packing corners (for\
  \ cardboard ones) and have switched all of consumer box packaging from U-Line to\
  \ <a href=\"https://www.alliancepackaging.net/\">Alliance Packaging</a>, who use\
  \ an average of 50% recycled paper in their boxes. Your products will continue to\
  \ be shipped as safely and securely as we can make them, only with more thought\
  \ put into the environmental and social impacts of what we do.</p> \n     <p>Thanks\
  \ again for supporting Paizo!</p> \n     <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight:\
