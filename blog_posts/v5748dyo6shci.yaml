  \ into his chair scratching a muttonchop with calloused fingers while waiting for\

  \ Gorm replies. “It’s a hard thing, knowing where to send our best talent, and how\
  \ to get them there prepared to face the kinds of things we Pathfinders are bound\
  \ to face. Besides, if we tried something that reckless, Fola would drag us both\
  \ outside by our ears and thrash us one by one while making the other watch so they\
  \ know what’s coming for them! And she’d be right to do it.” Scratching his belly\
  \ under his vest, Gorm’s hand suddenly comes away holding a frothing mug, which\
  \ he quickly downs. “A scotch might be better right about now,” he mutters, before\
  \ raising his head to look Ambrus directly in the eyes. “I suppose we need to let\
  \ those three know they’re on their own, eh?”</p> \n       <p>Ambrus releases a\
  \ breath he hadn’t meant to hold and reaches for the pen that will magically convey\

  \ request for backup had set the tone for this pensive afternoon.</p> \n       <p>“\
  You want me to write ‘em?” Gorm asks, eyes brimming with sympathy for both Ambrus\
  \ and the waiting agents whose request for aid the steward was about to deny.</p>\
  \ \n       <p>“No, they deserve to hear it from me,” Ambrus says. “I put them there,\
  \ I won’t let anyone else be the one to tell them that they need to find their own\
  \ way to a safe evacuation point.” Ambrus pauses for a moment, and then glances\
  \ at Gorm with a pleading and apologetic look in his eyes. “But maybe do me one\
  \ favor? Go grab me one of Arvya’s muffins from the kitchen and bring back a carafe\
  \ of coffee. It’s going to be a long afternoon.”</p> \n       <br clear=\"all\"\

  description\">It’s been a long, hectic couple months, but I think overall, they’\
  ve been good. We got the Achievement Point system up for Pathfinder Second Edition,\
  \ loaded with boons and ready for use! Sanctioning for the Advanced Player’s Guide\
  \ beat the book to your eyes by a couple weeks, and Lost Omens Legends followed\
  \ quick behind, along with a wave of new iconic pregenerated characters! The last\
  \ batch of level 5 pregens will be releasing very soon, with Seoni, Seelah, Harsk,\
  \ Sajan, Lem, and Lini leveling up to join the ranks of their compatriots. </p>\
  \ \n      <p>As we worked through the tasks of creating pregens, a couple years\
  \ ago for Starfinder and over the last year for Pathfinder (second edition), the\
  \ team made some fundamental decisions about the place of pregens at the table.\
  \ We evaluated our own experiences and reviewed feedback from the Pathfinder (first)\
  \ edition campaign, as well as solicited feedback from volunteer coordinators and\
  \ GMs. After much consideration, the team decided that releasing level 7 or 9 pregens\
  \ held more drawbacks than benefits and that we would not produce pregens at higher\
  \ levels for either campaign. As a result of the decision not to include 7th level\
  \ or higher pregens, we are making some program-wide changes regarding legal table\
  \ limits and the use of pregenerated characters at tables. The following rules take\
  \ effect immediately and will be included in future iterations of the Guide to Organized\
  \ Play for each campaign.</p> \n      <p>For tables at levels that have pregens\
  \ available. GMs can now run up to two pregenerated characters to fill a table up\
  \ to the four-person minimum. The GM can control these pregens themselves or designate\
  \ one or more players to control the additional character(s), so long as the player\
  \ agrees to do so. This should help our smaller lodges and Society home groups participate\
  \ in our program and continue firing and reporting games.</p> \n      <p><b>For\
  \ higher level Pathfinder (second edition) play:</b></p> \n      <ul style=\"list-style-type:none;\"\
  > \n       <li>In Level 7+ adventures, we are reducing the minimum number of players\
  \ to three. This opens up a “hard mode” playthrough experience that should be satisfying,\
  \ though we want to caution you that, as the adventures are designed for a minimum\
  \ of four players, they will be more difficult than normal. To play with three players,\
  \ add Challenge Points for a hypothetical fourth player as follows:</li> \n    \
  \   <br> \n       <ul style=\"list-style-type:none;\"> \n        <li>Groups of three\
  \ players whose total Challenge Points are less than 12 add 2 to their Challenge\
  \ Point total to determine their final Challenge Point scaling and encounter adjustments,\
  \ winding up in the adventure’s lower level range. </li> \n        <br> \n     \
  \   <li>Groups of three whose total Challenge Points are 12 or higher add 4 Challenge\
  \ Points to their total value to determine their final Challenge Point scaling and\
  \ encounter adjustments, winding up in the adventure’s higher-level range. </li>\
  \ \n       </ul> \n      </ul> \n      <p>The first Level 7-10 scenario won’t release\
  \ until June, so those of you getting ready to play at that level range can begin\
  \ to plan accordingly, and those of you out there who only have two players can\
  \ begin filling the remaining two seats with pregens and reporting your games.</p>\
  \ \n      <p><b>For higher level Starfinder play:</b></p> \n      <ul style=\"list-style-type:none;\"\
  > \n       <li>For levels that go above 8th (the current highest level of our pregenerated\
  \ characters), we’ll be allowing groups to play with a 3-player minimum. Note, these\
  \ smaller table sizes are strictly for players who willingly play expecting that\
  \ the adventure will be harder. As with other instances of hard mode, all players\
  \ at a table need to opt into the hard mode before starting the game.</li> \n  \
  \     <br> \n       <li>These 3-player adjustments offer no additional scaling (beyond\
  \ the already existing 4-player adjustment) and do not grant extra rewards... well...\
  \ except for the obvious bragging rights! I for one can’t wait to see how well a\
  \ group of 3 PCs handles the higher-level range in Rise of the Vault Lord!</li>\
  \ \n      </ul> \n      <p>As with all program changes, we will evaluate them over\
  \ the next few months to see if they are helping us achieve our aim, which is getting\
  \ more games to successfully occur. We will keep an eye on this thread in upcoming\
  \ months for feedback on these changes. </p> \n      <p>Have a good one everyone,\
  \ and until next time- Explore! Report! Cooperate!</p> \n      <p style=\"margin-left:\
