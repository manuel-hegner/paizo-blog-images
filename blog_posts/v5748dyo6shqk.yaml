  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">While the writers of our\
  \ Paizo products are always credited in the front and back of the books, a simple\
  \ name in a byline doesn’t give readers much information on the people who work\
  \ to bring the setting to life! I know some of you have been clamoring to know who\
  \ wrote what section in the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq027ot/discuss?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-The-Mwangi-Expanse\"\
  ><em>Mwangi Expanse</em></a>, so I reached out to the authors of the book with the\
  \ intent of promoting them—as well as any other personal work they would like to\
  \ share—so that new fans of their work could find other projects, RPG products,\
  \ websites, livestreams, and more to enjoy!</p> \n     <p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\

  \ Adams</h3> \n     <p>Greetings, I am Laura-Shay Adams, a part-time writer and\
  \ full-time nerd. The amount of excitement I experienced at being able to contribute\
  \ to Senghor was probably not entirely healthy, but warranted. Getting to provide\
  \ and create perspective regarding the day-to-day life within the city and fleshing\
  \ out some of the prominent businesses made me fall in love with Golarion all over\
  \ again. The setting has so many strengths, and using it as a creative backdrop\
  \ to offer such a wide array of cultural flavors that add so much to storytelling\
  \ is honestly a joy. Each Lost Omens book that has come out has become my favorite,\
  \ but the <em>Mwangi Expanse</em> area will be near and dear to my heart for decades\
  \ to come. </p> \n     <p>If you are interested in seeing some of the homebrew projects\
  \ I’ve come up with for my personal campaigns, one-shots, or my freelancer rates,\
  \ drop by my website <a href=\"https://world-invader.com/\" target=\"_blank\">https://world-invader.com</a>\
  \ or contact me via email, at contact.us@world-invader.com. Or if anyone is hosting\
  \ a game set in the Mwangi Expanse and needs an extra player, I am your lady if\
  \ our times align.</p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Mariam Ahmad</h3> \n     <p>Hello,\
  \ I’m Mariam Ahmad (they/them). I’m a queer South Asian freelance writer, and I\
  \ am so honored to have been a part of this book, my first with Paizo. For <em>Mwangi\
  \ Expanse</em>, I had the pleasure of contributing lore on the Taralu and penning\
  \ Amakell Inre and her draconic companion, Sahiba. My favorite part of this process\
  \ was not just putting imagination to paper, but seeing it brought to life by the\
  \ wonderful artists. </p> \n     <p>I’ve also written for other indie games, such\
  \ as Thirsty Sword Lesbians and Rookwood. When I’m not writing or working on cultural\
  \ consultancy projects, I stream on Huetopia as the GM of Kahaaniyaan and run a\
  \ podcast called The Musafirs. Both are all Q-BIMPoC actual plays that are set in\
  \ Sarzameen, my custom South Asian fantasy setting. If you want to see updates on\
  \ things I do, as well enjoy pictures of food, cats and fibre arts, you can follow\
  \ me on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/media_junkie\" target=\"_blank\">@media_junkie</a>.</p>\
  \ \n     <br> \n     <h3>Jamal Brown</h3> \n     <p>Hey What’s happening! I’m Jahmal\
  \ “Mad Jay” Brown, and I’m a contributing author on <em>Mwangi Expanse</em>. The\
  \ Karina, Solar Ibis and the Zinba are my babies! During the design process I imagined\
  \ big encounters focusing on these creatures. I know you’re not supposed to have\
  \ a favorite kid. . . but mine are the Karina!</p> \n     <p>I also worked on Mzali\
  \ and Senghor, two big and very different cities in the Expanse. The final product\
  \ looks FANTASTIC! I’m glad I got to be a part of this project of so many amazing\
  \ authors. You can catch up with my other works on <a href=\"http://www.madjayzero.com/#_blank\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">www.madjayzero.com</a>, and I am on twitter @madjayzero. I write\
  \ about the games I run, game design, and facilitating game sessions. I’m currently\
  \ doing layout work on my latest Kickstarter project, Lifted, a supers setting Zine.</p>\

  \ heck, back at it again with the writing! I’m Allie Bustion, freelance game designer\
  \ and writer with indie projects of my own but also work on games like <em>Thirsty\
  \ Sword Lesbian</em>s (“Shinsei Galactic Puroresu: Revolution - The Final Engagement”\
  ) and <em>Brinkwood: The Blood of Tyrants</em> (“The Scene Is Dead, Long Live The\
  \ Scene”). I wrote a good chunk of things for <em>Mwangi Expanse</em>, but I think\
  \ my favorite are the Song’o. I put a lot of the joyful parts of being Black from\
  \ my childhood into them, and I’m super excited to share it with you all.</p> \n\

  \ writer and designer. For the <em>Mwangi Expanse</em> book, I got to contribute\
  \ various locations in Mzali and Senghor and had a blast. The Mzali Archives, the\
  \ Sunlit Inn, the Mixing Mingle, and Burash’s Lost and Found are just a few of the\
  \ entries I got to dream up! I’m really happy with the finished product and grateful\
  \ to get to contribute alongside all these wonderful people. In my spare time, I\
  \ write stories, come up with my own games and homebrews, and craft!</p> \n    \

  \ Solatra Lilac Harvinkai, credited as Sasha Laranoa Harving, and I wrote the Taralu\
  \ dwarves! I was really glad to flesh out a culture I’d worked on prior in the <em>Pathfinder\
  \ Lost Omens: Character Guide</em>’s dwarf section, and I am excited for you all\
  \ to see what wonders it has in store. I’ve been involved with a number of third-party\
  \ publishers for Pathfinder and Starfinder as well, and I live in Chicago with my\
  \ fiancee and my roommate, both also regular players in my games. If you’d like\
  \ to hire me for freelance work, you can reach me at condochimp@gmail.com. Thanks!</p>\

  \ by now. If you’re new here, let me tell you. I am Michelle Jones, freelance writer\
  \ and game designer. I got to write several of the deity entries for <em>Pathfinder\
  \ Lost Omens: Mwangi Expanse</em>, as well as a couple of bestiary entries, and\
  \ collaborated with some very talented authors to reintroduce everyone to the city\
  \ of Mzali. If you wanna know more, be sure to check out my twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Aleshakills\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">@AleshaKills</a>. I will be going into more detail about everything\
  \ I wrote the moment the book hits the streets. </p> \n     <p>I promise you, <em>Mwangi\
  \ Expanse</em> has everything you wanted and everything you didn’t know you needed.\
  \ And Strength of the Thousands is gonna be possibly the greatest Adventure Path\
  \ ever. I’m not biased just because my name is on it, I swear. See you all again\
  \ on the 7th.</p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Travis Lionel</h3> \n     <p>Hello, my\
  \ name is Travis Lionel also known on the internet as Rabbit. I worked on <em>Pathfinder\
  \ Lost Omens: Mwangi Expanse</em>, specifically the sections on the People of Mzali\
  \ and the Bright Lions. I did a lot of research on western and middle Africa as\
  \ well as usede my own experiences as a black American and those of my African brothers\
  \ and sisters. The most fun I had was studying how pre-colonized Africans lived\
  \ among the Savannahs. Since working on this project, I’ve primarily been diving\
  \ into video game livestreams via Twitch ( <a href=\"https://twitch.tv/EightBitRabbits\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">https://twitch.tv/EightBitRabbits</a> ). Here I talk about storytelling,\
  \ how I learned to write and worldbuild, and, of course, role-playing games, such\
  \ as <em>Pathfinder: Kingmaker</em>. For those who enjoy what I wrote and would\
  \ like me to work on their projects as well, feel free to send business inquiries\
  \ to <a href=\"mailto:Travis.TheBlanketFort@gmail.com\">Travis.TheBlanketFort@gmail.com</a>.\
  \ It’s kind of crazy going from the eleven year old in Catholic school turning biblical\
  \ lore into super hero stories to where I am now. Hopefully, you guys enjoy the\
  \ work many of us put into this project. </p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Hilary Moon\
  \ Murphy</h3> \n     <p>My name is Hilary Moon Murphy. In real life, I am a librarian,\
  \ freelancer, and enthusiastic Organized Play Game Master. I am so proud to be a\
  \ part of this book! I wrote the section on the Sodden Lands, which included both\
  \ the flooded city Hyrantum and the fierce Terwa Lords. Being able to update Hyrantum\
  \ and reimagine what has happened with that flooded city and the rest of the Sodden\
  \ Lands was a true pleasure. When we last saw Hyrantum, it was a sad and downtrodden\
  \ shadow of its former glory. But Hyrantum is undergoing a new boom with a surprising\
  \ new group of immigrants. . . To find out more, you really should purchase this\
  \ book!</p> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/f97625ff-349b-4c05-8722-ffa740d3aa81/20210713-alijae-half-elf.png\"\

  \     <h3>Mikhail Rekun</h3> \n     <p>Здравствуйте, уважаемые читатели! (Hello,\
  \ dear readers!) My name is Mikhail Sergeyevich Rekun, and you may know me from\
  \ past Lost Omen books, such as <em>Legends</em> (where I wrote Baba Yaga), <em>Ancestries</em>\
  \ (tieflings and duskwalkers), and the <em>Character Guide</em> (humans). On those\
  \ occasions that Eleanor and Luis don’t need my humble assistance, I’m a Russian-American\
  \ historian and educator with a book and everything.</p> \n     <p>For this book,\
  \ I wrote the Mbe’ke dwarves, the Mwangi Jungle, and my personal favorite, the gnolls.\
  \ My very first PC, way back in the misty depths of time, was a gnoll fighter, and\
  \ I’ve been on a one-man crusade to get the loveable, furry lugs made into an acceptable\
  \ PC ancestry ever since. Which, thanks to this excellent book, they are, so do\
  \ check them out.</p> \n     <p>I should also mention that when not writing for\
  \ Paizo, I’m working on <em>Ourichor: Fulcrum of the Luminant Age</em>, an upcoming\
  \ campaign setting set in a world of lost suns, teleporting rats, and people who\
  \ can drink your personality traits. Check out our Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LuminantA\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">https://twitter.com/LuminantA</a>! Our first Kickstarter project\
  \ is almost ready to release, so keep an eye out for what’ll come next. You might\

  \ and I’m excited for y’all to get to see my work on the <em>Pathfinder Lost Omens:\
  \ Mwangi Expanse</em> sourcebook for Pathfinder 2nd Edition. I had the honor of\
  \ writing “Reclaiming the Expanse,” as well as penning the cities of Jaha and Osibu\
  \ for the book. </p> \n     <p>Earlier this year, you may have read my work on <em>Van\
  \ Richten’s Guide to Ravenloft</em> with Wizards of the Coast, and if you follow\
