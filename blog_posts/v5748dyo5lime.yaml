  >Last week, a bunch of us attended the GAMA Trade Show, the hobby game industry's\
  \ annual spring showcase event. I did a few interviews there, including this one\
  \ from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVc9uQIg3Vs#t=19m00s\" target=\"\
  _blank\">noted Pathfinder ACG fan Eric Summerer of the Dice Tower</a>, where I lead\
  \ off with some information on <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5li5d\"><em>Mummy's\
  \ Mask</em></a>, <a href=\"/products/btpy9jcw\"><em>Goblins Fight!</em></a>, and\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9k5m\"><em>Goblins Burn!</em></a> before launching into\
  \ other stuff Lone Shark Games is doing.</p> \n    <p>Going to GAMA always makes\
  \ me reminisce, because it was four years ago almost to the day when I walked into\
  \ GAMA 2012 with a wine box containing a humble prototype called \"Saints\" under\
  \ my arm. Lead Developer Chad Brown and I had whipped up a set of cards based on\
  \ a concept by me and my friend Rian Sand. It carried with it a modern horror story,\
  \ but fundamentally it could work with any sufficiently adaptable story-based property.\
  \ We weren't sure what we were going to do with it, but we resolved that we would\
  \ know that by the end of the show. My first meeting was the one I wanted to work\
  \ out the most, with Paizo's Erik Mona and Jeff Alvarez.</p> \n    <p>Across the\
  \ table in my hotel room, I said something like, \"Now, this game isn't Pathfinder.\
  \ But you guys are smart enough to know what it would look like if it was Pathfinder.\"\
  \ After playing for an hour, Jeff and Erik looked at each other and—after a bit\
  \ of uncomfortable silence where they figured out who was gonna talk first—Erik\
  \ said, \"This is amazing. We have to talk to Vic and Lisa, but I think we want\
  \ to do this.\"</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-Cover.jpg\"\

  \ by Wayne Reynolds</i>\n     <br>Cover Image for the <em>Rise of the Runelords\
  \ Base Set</em>\n    </div> \n    <p>A week later, our team had a plan to make a\
  \ game with our friends at Paizo. It would require a year of investment as we rebuilt\
  \ the game to work with the richest set of material we could imagine. The game expanded\
  \ in its reach: Originally designed to scale from low-level metahuman to moderate-level\
  \ metahuman, now it had to scale from fresh-faced cub adventurer to near-godlike\
  \ titan of sword and sorcery. The stories would be big, based on Paizo's vaunted\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath\">Adventure Paths</a>. And we picked probably\
  \ the biggest story we could right out of the gate: the modern classic <a href=\"\
  /pathfinder/adventurePath/riseOfTheRunelords\"><em>Rise of the Runelords</em></a>.\
  \ This set would take Chad's personality: expansive, complex, and all-inclusive.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>By the GAMA Trade Show of 2013, Chad, Gaby Weidling, Paul Peterson, Tanis\
  \ O'Connor, and I had finished design on the <a href=\"/products/btpy951a\"><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Adventure Card Game: Rise of the Runelords Base Set</em></a>, edited by Vic Wertz\
  \ and Judy Bauer, and made into a real-looking game by Sarah Robinson and her team.\
  \ I showed up to GAMA with a pre-production copy—the <i>only</i> pre-production\
  \ copy. Sales savant Cosmo Eisele and I tucked ourselves in a tiny room in the top\
  \ floor of the conference center at Bally's. I mean, it was no bigger than the interior\
  \ of a VW Beetle. We showed the game to distributors and retailers five at a time\
  \ at a nonstop clip. At this point, we guessed we had a pretty good game. Maybe\
  \ a minor hit with people who'd stopped playing the Pathfinder RPG. Maybe bigger,\
  \ if the cards broke right.</p> \n    <p>I think you know how that went. To our\
  \ surprise, the <a href=\"/products/btpy951a\"><em>Rise of the Runelords Base Set</em></a>\
  \ blew the walls off Gen Con 2013, becoming the number one hit of the show. It was\
  \ a vastly bigger reaction than we imagined we'd get. Most interestingly, only a\
  \ small portion of the game's fan base had ever played the Pathfinder RPG, or for\
  \ that matter any RPG. What Paizo and Lone Shark created was a new genre, if only\
  \ we managed to get more of it done.</p> \n    <p>As we came home from Indianapolis,\
  \ our teams agreed we needed to make another base set that could show off some more\
  \ tricks that the system could perform. We settled on the pirate-themed <a href=\"\
  /pathfinder/adventureCardGame/skullAndShackles\"><em>Skull &amp; Shackles</em></a>—\
  and were already two months late on our design. With ships and sharks galore, this\
  \ would become Gaby's set: rollicking, inventive, challenging to figure out. Emblematic\
  \ of the set was our first promo character, the highly popular goblin <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy96ie\">Ranzak</a>.</p> \n    <p>To make our lives more difficult,\
  \ we also began a line of seven <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/classDecks\"\
  >Class Decks</a> that would allow for a new style of organized play. What that style\
  \ of organized play would become was anyone's guess. Tanis hopped over from Lone\
  \ Shark to Paizo to figure that out. What emerged was the groundbreaking Season\
  \ 0 of the <a href=\"/pfsacg\">Pathfinder Society Adventure Card Guild</a>. Season\
  \ of the Shackles was Tanis's \"set\": adventurous, clever, mildly strange <i>[also\
  \ winning and fun at parties—Tanis]</i>. I don't mind saying that we barely knew\
  \ what we were doing, but it worked. People came out in droves to play with strangers\
  \ at conventions and retail shops.</p> \n    <p>By GAMA 2014, we had picked up some\
  \ new friends along the way. UltraPRO created <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/accessories\"\
  >a line of boffo accessories</a>, including playmats, deck boxes, and deck protectors.\
  \ WizKids gave us <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles/iconicHeroes\">six sets of miniatures</a>\
  \ in which we embedded promo cards for all our iconic characters. And DriveThruCards\
  \ constructed a fantastic <a href=\"http://www.drivethrucards.com/builder/pathfinder\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">community card creator</a> so that all our fans could make their\
  \ own cards.</p> \n    <p>Meanwhile, the Lone Shark team grew. We added designers\
  \ Liz Spain and Keith Richmond to the club right as we were developing <a href=\"\
  /pathfinder/adventureCardGame/wrathOfTheRighteous\"><em>Wrath of the Righteous</em></a>.\
  \ GAMA 2015 saw the release of Paul's set: gigantic, intricate, over the top. Everything\
  \ that could happen in a PACG set happened here: army battles, mythic power, retainers,\
  \ characters introduced midway through the adventure path. Wrath had no limits.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>We continued pounding away at the corners of the game with three new\
  \ waves of Class Decks, now available in a <a href=\"/products/btpy9ewj\">monthly\
  \ subscription</a>. We followed up Season of the Shackles with a new tier system\
  \ for <a href=\"/pfsacg/products/season1\">Season of the Righteous</a>, written\
  \ by Keith, Tanis, and I. And Tanis introduced a whiz-bang new format for tournaments\
  \ at Gen Con: the <a href=\"/blog/v5748dyo5lhtk\">PACG Open</a>.</p> \n    <p>Oh,\
  \ and there was <a href=\"https://pathfinder.obsidian.net\" target=\"_blank\">this\
  \ cool thing from Obsidian</a>, developed in collaboration with us. Pathfinder Adventures\
  \ is the digital realization of everything that's cool about PACG, without any of\
  \ the less cool fuss and bother of setup and cleanup. You'll get it in just a few\
  \ weeks.</p> \n    <p>By GAMA 2016, we were closing the books on <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5li5d\"\
  ><em>Mummy's Mask</em></a>, which became Liz's set: crafty, historical, just a little\
  \ insane. The team also started work on wave 5 of the class decks, bringing our\
  \ total of developed class decks to a mind boggling 20 decks. (You don't know yet\
  \ what #19 and #20 are. Stay tuned.) By GAMA 2016, adding together all the sets,\
  \ expansions, class decks, guild adventures, accessories, and miniature sets, we\
  \ were almost at 100 different things we'd designed or approved for PACG. It's a\
  \ very big game with a whole lot of ways to play.</p> \n    <p>All that in four\
  \ short years. More soon, I promise, including what we hope will be Keith's set\
  \ in 2017. It's been a fun ride, so thanks for coming along!</p> \n    <p>Mike Selinker<br>\
