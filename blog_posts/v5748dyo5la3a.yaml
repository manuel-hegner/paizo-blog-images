  \ <h1>Planet Stories Subscriptions</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Friday, December\
  \ 14, 2007</p> \n   <p>I don't have a lot of time to read these days. It seems like\
  \ every time I turn around, there's more work to be done, or a social engagement...\
  \ you all know the drill. So when it comes to buying novels, I tend to be pretty\
  \ conservative. There are so many books to sift through out there that buying at\
  \ random, or based on a 30-second perusal, just isn't viable—who can afford to start\
  \ reading a random novel, only to realize halfway through that it sucks? It's inefficient,\
  \ and as a result, I rarely pick up a book that hasn't already been recommended\
  \ by someone I trust.</p> \n  </blockquote> <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7x8c\"><img\

  >Planet Stories subscription option</a> is so amazing. This isn't some big churn-and-burn\
  \ corporate fiction imprint—it's a shortlist of book recommendations straight from\
  \ Erik Mona himself (with a little vetting from science fiction and fantasy scholar\
  \ Pierce Watters, plus yours truly). Every one of these books bears his stamp of\
  \ approval, and if you're perusing this site, odds are you share some of Erik's\
  \ tastes. In fact, as he explains in his editorial, simply being a gamer is enough\
  \ of a reason to pick up some of these novels—after all, you didn't think the genre\
  \ just sprang full-formed from nowhere, did you? Gygax and his roleplaying contemporaries\
  \ drew heavily on ideas from many of the authors we're featuring, and you might\
  \ be surprised how inspiring and relevant some of those texts remain. More than\
  \ just fun reading, these books are practically a correspondence course in the history\
  \ of sci-fi and fantasy—our genre's Great Books series. </p> \n   <p>Now, at last,\
  \ you can sign up to have them delivered to your door each month as they come out...\
  \ and at 20% off the cover price! What's more, if you sign up before the new year,\
  \ you have the option of purchasing any or all of the books that have already come\
  \ out at the same 20% discount. </p> \n  </blockquote> <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7x8b\"\

  \ This is Robert E. Howard, creator of Conan. This is Michael Moorcock, the mind\
  \ behind Elric of Melniboné. This is Leigh Brackett, who wrote <i>The Empire Strikes\
  \ Back</i>, and C. L. Moore, one of the first female SF authors, who created both\
  \ Northwest Smith and Jirel of Joiry (<i>the</i> original female sword-and-sorcery\
  \ protagonist). This is Gary Gygax, without whose creation of Dungeons and Dragons\
  \ our industry would not exist. </p> \n   <p>As C. J. Cherryh writes in her introduction\
  \ to <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7zdo\"><i>Northwest of Earth</i></a>, \"This is an\
  \ important book. Read it. Make sure your kids and grandkids read it. It's timeless,\
  \ and it's that good.\" As much could be said for all the books in our line. </p>\
  \ \n   <p>So please, this holiday season, check out the new <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7zxx\"\
  >Planet Stories subscriptions</a>, then sit back and let Uncle Erik make a few recommendations....\
