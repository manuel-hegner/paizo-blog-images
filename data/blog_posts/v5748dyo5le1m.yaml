  \ Time</h1> \n    <p>by Dave Gross</p> \n    <h2>Chapter One: The Night Visitor<br><i>Varian</i></h2>\
  \ \n    <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n     <p>The old servant fumbled with the\
  \ keys. The glow of the lantern transformed his gnarled hands into dried roots.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><span itemprop=\"description\">At my side, Arnisant growled a warning.\
  \ The instant I touched the Shadowless Sword, a gloved hand covered mine in a gesture\
  \ doubtless intended to reassure me. Instead, the unwelcome touch raised the hairs\
  \ on my neck. My pulse remained calm, however, a reminder of the strange transfiguration\
  \ of my lately sundered heart.</span></p> \n     <p>Invisible a moment earlier,\
  \ a woman glanced up at me. The shadow beneath her voluminous hood offered no impediment\
  \ to my half-elven vision, yet I perceived only a platinum mask inlaid with blue\
  \ gemstones. I had seen that mask only a few hours earlier, on one of the Decemvirate,\
  \ the anonymous inner circle of the Pathfinder Society. </p> \n     <p>I showed\
  \ Arnisant a hand sign. The wolfhound's growl ceased.</p> \n     <p>\"I'll take\
  \ those, Timon.\" The woman released my hand and reached for the lantern and keys.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>I recognized the servant's name. As he surrendered the lantern, I saw\
  \ that the wrinkles on his face and hands were the result not of age but of horrific\
  \ burns.</p> \n     <p>\"Timon of Korvosa,\" I said. \"The Timon who stole the captain\
  \ of the Sable Company's steed. The Timon who eloped with Chief Redmuzzle's daughter.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>He bowed, stiff from his wounds but with a crooked smile acknowledging\
  \ his pleasure at the recognition.</p> \n     <p>\"Eloped?\" The masked woman fidgeted,\
  \ keys rattling, light bobbing. \"Wasn't Chief Redmuzzle a goblin of the Mushfens?\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"The marriage was strictly a matter of self-preservation,\" said\
  \ Timon.</p> \n     <p>\"But goblins hate humans.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Shortly before\
  \ encountering Redmuzzle's tribe, I ran afoul of a marsh witch—\"</p> \n     <p>\"\
  Green Sobeska!\" I recalled his decades-old report in the Pathfinder Chronicles.\
  \ \"From the hag you retrieved several fragments of the tablets of Xanderghul. She\
  \ transmogrified you into a goblin as you fled her grotto.\"</p> \n     <p>\"I am\
  \ flattered that you remember, Venture-Captain.\"</p> \n     <p>Timon's use of my\
  \ Society title pleased and irritated me in equal portion. After my infuriating\
  \ audience with the Decemvirate, I remained uncertain of my status. In my long absence,\
  \ they had reassigned all of my field agents to others, leaving me a venture-captain\
  \ in name only.</p> \n     <p>\"Thank you, Timon.\" The woman's cool tone indicated\
  \ dismissal.</p> \n     <p>For a moment I wished Radovan were with me so that he\
  \ might slip a few coins into the retired Pathfinder's withered hand.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>As Timon withdrew, the woman brushed past me and opened the door. Before I\
  \ could identify her perfume—something Qadiran—the mingled scents of old paper,\
  \ parchment, and leather poured out of the building. The woman snapped her fingers.\
  \ Two rows of yellow lamps flickered to life along a pair of long reading tables.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Ranks of bookshelves surrounded the tables. Like tombs in a catacomb\
  \ lay thousands of old, damaged, or misfiled volumes of arcane and mundane lore.\
  \ The curators of the Grand Lodge's many libraries would determine which to restore\
  \ for general use and which to retire.</p> \n     <p>I felt a pang of sympathy for\
  \ the forgotten books and for Timon.</p> \n     <p>\"Are you sure you wouldn't rather\
  \ use one of the libraries?\" she asked.</p> \n     <p>\"I enjoy the solitude.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"It's better for sulking, isn't it?\" She saw the effect of her\
  \ remark in my posture. \"No, no, I'm sorry, Varian. That isn't how I meant to begin.\
  \ Here, I brought you a gift in honor of your long-awaited return from Tian Xia.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>She produced a goblet from beneath her cloak. I stifled my annoyance\
  \ at her familiar address, made all the more infuriating by her own anonymity. Since\
  \ my return to the Grand Lodge, no one but Timon had addressed me as \"Venture-Captain.\"\
  \ In default of that title, anyone less than a prince should address me as \"Your\
  \ Excellency,\" or at least as \"Count Jeggare.\"</p> \n     <p>She set the goblet\
  \ on a reading table and produced a pair of bottles. The curling labels seized my\
  \ attention: the wine came from my own vineyards in Western Cheliax, two of the\
  \ finest vintages ever produced in the Inner Sea. </p> \n     <p>Decades earlier\
  \ I had sent such bottles to certain of my field agents, who reported their excursions\
  \ to me for fact-checking, annotation, and ultimately submission to the Decemvirate\
  \ for potential inclusion in the Pathfinder Chronicles. Could this woman be Medesha?\
  \ Khirsah? It should not surprise me to learn that either of those talented women\
  \ had entered the Society's innermost circle.</p> \n     <p>I studied what little\
  \ I could see beneath the mask: sea-green eyes, coral lips, and a long, fair chin.\
  \ The enchantments of a Decemvirate mask could very well extend beyond the features\
  \ it covered, even disguising the wearer's voice. Perhaps the masked stranger was\
  \ not a woman, perhaps not even human.</p> \n     <p>As she poured the wine, I noticed\
  \ that the corks of both bottles had been previously drawn and reinserted.</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"You will join me, of course.\"</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb360\">\n\
  \      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Emissary.jpg\"><img src=\"\

  \     <br> The Decemvirate has a flair for the dramatic.\n     </div> \n     <p>\"\
  I hoped you would ask.\" She produced a second goblet from beneath her cloak. She\
  \ filled both vessels and allowed me to choose.</p> \n     <p>Her gesture only heightened\
  \ my caution, despite the seeming absurdity that a member of the Decemvirate would\
  \ poison me on the grounds of the Grand Lodge. I chose the goblet nearest me. As\
  \ I nosed the wine, she lifted the other goblet and said, \"To old friends.\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Whoever they are.\" I put the goblet to my lips to cover my sarcasm.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The wine covered my palate with ripe cherry balanced with a hint of\
  \ black olive and tobacco. After a moment's savor, I let the wine trail down my\
  \ throat, relishing its decades-mellowed character.</p> \n     <p>The woman admired\
  \ her goblet before setting it down. \"Patience has its rewards.\"</p> \n     <p>By\
  \ her tone, I knew she had prepared that remark.</p> \n     <p>I gestured for her\
  \ to sit, taking the chair opposite as Arnisant settled at my foot. He laid his\
  \ head upon his crossed forepaws and closed his eyes.</p> \n     <p>\"Believe me\
  \ when I say I understand your frustration,\" she began. Uttering my thoughts on\
  \ that proposition seemed impolite after accepting a drink, so I smiled. \"All right,\
  \ I can't possibly understand your frustration. But I can imagine that you feel\
  \ you deserve an explanation.\"</p> \n     <p>\"And you feel I do not deserve one?\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"I'm not saying that. I'm saying you must trust that we know what\
  \ we are doing.\"</p> \n     <p>\"What I know is that I accepted, without explanation,\
  \ a mission to retrieve this Celestial Pearl.\" Even as I named the artifact, I\
  \ felt the cool pulse of half of its former contents within my breast. My brief\
  \ death and subsequent resurrection by virtue of the dragon's heart was one of several\
  \ intentional lacunae in my report to the Decemvirate. \"During my absence, no effort\
  \ was mounted to aid or rescue me and my—\"</p> \n     <p>\"We had no message from\
  \ you.\"</p> \n     <p>\"So you say. I sent three before misadventure prevented\
  \ further communication.\"</p> \n     <p>\"So <i>you</i> say.\" She drained the\
  \ rest of her wine and refilled the goblet as I seethed. Once again, I noticed the\
  \ eerie calm of my heartbeat even as the muscles in my neck drew painfully tight.\
  \ \"The truth is that I believe you, Varian. Others do as well. What I don't believe\
  \ is that all the wizards of the Grand Lodge are lying about receiving no messages.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"It takes only one to sow deceit.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Your concerns\
  \ are noted. And...\" She looked toward the door and peered into the darkness between\
  \ the book stacks. Beside me, Arnisant lay still, breathing steadily. Surely he\
  \ would have scented any intruder, so I took her gesture for more mummery. \"The\
  \ oaths of the Decemvirate are more demanding than those of the Society at large.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"If nothing else, my tenure in the Society should afford me the\
  \ courtesy of an explanation. What was the purpose of my fetching the Celestial\
  \ Pearl? Why can I not see the <i>Lacuna Codex</i>? Why will no one explain—?\"\
  </p> \n     <p> \"I'm sorry, Varian. Already I've told you more than I should. You\
  \ must place your faith in the judgment of the Decemvirate.\"</p> \n     <p>\"As\
  \ Eando Kline did?\"</p> \n     <p>She sighed. \"I knew you would throw that in\
  \ my face.\"</p> \n     <p>\"The machinations of the Decemvirate seem to be driving\
  \ away the most promising members of the Society even as others retire.\"</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"Kline's mistake was to place his judgment over that of the Decemvirate.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"Was that a mistake?\"</p> \n     <p>\"You don't have all the information.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"Perhaps if I did—\"</p> \n     <p>\"It is strictly need-to-know—\
  \"</p> \n     <p>\"I am a Pathfinder. By definition, I <i>need to know</i>.\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>She made a silent snarl, a gesture reminding me of Radovan's big smile,\
  \ except for her perfect white teeth. I raised an eyebrow, half amused at the image\
  \ she presented.</p> \n     <p>She let out a sigh and shook her head. \"Try to resist\
  \ the impulse to have the last word tomorrow. You might get it.\"</p> \n     <p>\"\
  Perhaps tomorrow I will want it.\"</p> \n     <p>\"I beg you not to follow Ollysta's\
  \ example, Varian. Don't throw away a long and distinguished career for the sake\
  \ of pride.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Honor.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Semantics.\"</p> \n     <p>\"\
  Only to someone who has forgotten the difference.\"</p> \n     <p>She pushed back\
  \ from the table, jostling the bottles and goblets. \"Enjoy the wine. Timon will\
  \ return later to unlock the door.\"</p> \n     <p>As she walked away, I took her\
  \ advice and resisted the impulse to have the last word. When she slammed the door\
  \ shut behind her, I opened my satchel.</p> \n     <p>Arranging my remaining riffle\
  \ scrolls, I set out a pot of ink, two compartmentalized boxes full of various material\
  \ essences, dozens of blank riffle scrolls, a blank journal, another half-filled\
  \ with my notes and sketches from Tian Xia, and my latest grimoire.</p> \n     <p>It\
  \ was to fill the latter volume that I had come to this repository. While I had\
  \ learned many new spells during my time at Dragon Temple, I wished to add others\
  \ to my repertoire now that I was no longer an armchair arcanist but a practicing\
  \ wizard.</p> \n     <p>Draining my goblet, I selected a riffle scroll and raised\
  \ the cup. With two fingers I pinned a riffle scroll against the heel of my palm\
  \ and thumbed the edge. The pages zipped past with a satisfying burp. Arcane light\
  \ surrounded the goblet.</p> \n     <p>Holding it high, I searched the stacks for\
  \ the tomes I sought. The organization was more or less as I remembered. Soon I\
  \ returned to the table with three books of spells.</p> \n     <p>For a few minutes\
  \ I indulged the nostalgic reflex, lingering over the names and annotations of the\
  \ Pathfinder wizards who had fallen in the field. Two had once reported to me as\
  \ their venture-captain. The other had been a friend, one whose humorous letters\
  \ I could recite almost verbatim.</p> \n     <p>After pouring another goblet of\
  \ wine, I set to work. Hours later, I had inscribed several long-desired spells.\
  \ As I finished copying an interesting illusion, I lifted the second bottle to find\
  \ that it, too, was empty. A wave of fatigue fell over me. I shook my head, and\
  \ the feeling passed.</p> \n     <p> Arnisant distracted my thought with a loud\
  \ and abrupt snore. Placing my toe against the dog's ribs, I reconsidered jostling\
  \ him but instead withdrew my foot. Like Radovan and me, he had endured a long,\
  \ arduous journey. The loyal hound deserved his rest.</p> \n     <p> \"A loyal dog\
  \ does deserve his rest.\" A liquid voice echoed my thoughts as a masked man stepped\
  \ into the lamplight.</p> \n     <p>He wore a mask of hammered gold painted with\
  \ enamel at brows, lips, and beard. Beneath jeweled arm rings, crisp linen wound\
  \ tight around his arms. He wore a breastplate of compressed peacock feathers and\
  \ a pleated scarlet kilt. From one hip hung a khopesh in a jeweled half-sheath.\
  \ From the other dangled a pair of bound books and a miniature chariot of elm, ash,\
  \ and sycamore. Scents of myrrh, sandalwood, cedar, and attar of roses flowed from\
  \ him.</p> \n     <p>The stranger's obscured face rose in an imperial gesture, and\
  \ he said, \"Although you are a most disloyal dog, Count Jeggare, you too shall\
  \ have the rest you deserve—a final rest.\"</p> \n     <p><b>Coming Next Week:</b>\
