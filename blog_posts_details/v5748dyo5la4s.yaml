  artist: "and hear what the imaginations behind Pathfinder, GameMastery, and more\
    \ have to say about the future of the industry? Kicking things off, Erik Mona\
    \ sat down with Chris Pramas of Green Ronin to discuss the announcement of 4th\
    \ edition and what that means for the Open Game License and d20 publishing, which\
    \ leads them into a discussion of Paizo's new ventures, high-level play, and more.\
    \ And of course, it wouldn't be Erik without a significant foray into the \"storied\
    \ history of Greyhawk.\" Click here to check out the 73-minute behemoth (guaranteed\
    \ to keep your brain alive at work through that long post-lunch lull!) and get\
    \ the inside dirt"
