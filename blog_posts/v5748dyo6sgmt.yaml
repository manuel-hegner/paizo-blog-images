  \ treatises on magic was at the heart of his Iconic Encounter <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgjg?Iconic-Encounter-Puzzle-Box\"\
  >a few months ago</a>. Others, however, like the <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo5la75\"\
  >iconic sorcerer, Seoni</a>, gain their magical abilities from their blood, whether\
  \ that's a hint of an extraplanar power or simply legendary ancestors from ages\
  \ long past. Enjoy the following piece of short fiction from James L. Sutter in\
  \ the next entry into our series of Iconic Encounters—brief vignettes of the iconic\
  \ characters showcasing the myriad stories you can tell with Pathfinder Second Edition.</p>\

  \    <blockquote> \n     <p>The gargoyles hit like a ton of bricks—which they were,\
  \ more or less. Valeros went flying as the leading statue-beast slammed into him,\
  \ and if not for Kyra grabbing his leg as he sailed past, he might have tumbled\
  \ from the roof entirely. Seoni only barely managed to dodge the two that came for\
  \ her, their stony wings chipping shards from the parapet as they swooped in for\
  \ the kill.</p> \n     <p>Valeros didn't bother to stand. From his position flat\
  \ on his back, he thrust upward with his sword. Steel sparked and screeched across\
  \ stone pectorals, barely scratching one of the beasts as it glided past, claws\
  \ raking at his armor.</p> \n     <p>Behind him, light blazed from 'Kyra's holy\
  \ symbol, casting long shadows against the dusk.</p> \n     <p>\"It's no good!\"\
  \ the cleric shouted, lashing out ineffectively with her own blade. \"They're not\
  \ evil!\"</p> \n     <p>\"You could have fooled me!\" Valeros rolled aside as claws\
  \ gouged stone like bread dough, leaving deep furrows. He barely blocked a second\
  \ strike with his shield. \"Cayden's cup, how do we hurt these things?\"</p> \n\
  \     <p>How indeed? Seoni raised her staff, then hesitated. Would fire even touch\
  \ these stone monstrosities? Or lightning?</p> \n     <p>Best to be safe. She let\
  \ her eyes defocus, turning her sight inward—down inside herself, to the roiling\
  \ core. Across her skin, tattoos flared to life, their blue light feeding back into\
  \ her, running like ley lines into her soul.</p> \n     <p>For Ezren, magic was\
  \ a memory—the struggle to record and remember, his wizardry dry and academic. For\
  \ Kyra, it was channeling the power the divine, making herself a vessel for the\
  \ sun goddess's holy flame.</p> \n     <p>For Seoni, it was both of these and neither.\
  \ The power came to her like a memory, but it was not her memory. The power that\
  \ filled her was not a god's, but her own people's, a thousand generations flowing\
  \ through her veins. With it came their whispers—shards of lives she'd never lived,\
  \ voices long since turned to dust. Uncounted faces staring back from inside her.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Sigils blazed in the air before her. They spun around her hands, then\
  \ shot forward like darts, smashing through the gargoyles' stone flesh in bloodless\
  \ explosions. The monsters screamed in shock and pain, banking away from the tower.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Seoni smiled, but only briefly. She'd proved the creatures could be\
  \ hurt, but her missiles were too weak to take on all of them singlehanded. Wearing\
  \ them down would take too long, and already the beasts were wheeling around for\
  \ another pass.</p> \n     <p>Yet something about the creatures' twisted visages\
  \ tugged at her memory.</p> \n     <p>Or maybe not her memory...</p> \n     <p>Falling\
  \ back into the shelter of the cathedral's doorway, she closed her eyes. Shutting\
  \ out the snarls of the enemy and the shouts of her friends, she sought new voices—\
  those flowing through her blood. They surged louder, surrounding her as she asked\
  \ her silent question.</p> \n     <p>A storm of images, whirling and chaotic. Faces\
  \ familiar and foreign, seasons flickering past like lightning. A flash of stone\
  \ wings. The glint of a blade too bright for steel...</p> \n     <p>Seoni's eyes\
  \ snapped open. \"Adamantine! They're vulnerable to adamantine!\"</p> \n     <p>Kyra\
  \ dodged another claw swipe and looked over at her, her own eyes wide. \"Those blades\
  \ in the crypt! The ones the knights were buried with!\"</p> \n     <p>\"Then what\
  \ are we waiting for?\" Through bruises and blood, Valeros grinned. \"Looks like\
  \ the church is going to make a donation to us for a change!\"</p> \n    </blockquote>\

  \ Thursday for another new entry in the series. Until then, Pathfinders, may the\
  \ power of your ancestors flow through your veins.</p> \n    <p>Mark Moreland<br>\
