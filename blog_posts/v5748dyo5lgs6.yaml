  \ \n    <p>I could swear I've written this blog before, and I could swear it has\
  \ started a different way each time.</p> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">In fact,\
  \ this blog has been about a year in the making, ever since I took a copy of Paizo's\
  \ second 64-page model with me over Thanksgiving break to begin working on that\
  \ adventure's sanctioning document. It's been through about four revisions since\
  \ then, each one not quite turning out as I had envisioned before other priorities\
  \ put an end to my edits.</p> \n    <p>Something changed with this last go-around.\
  \ I put an end to saying, \"No, this is too silly to be a boon\" and began asking,\
  \ \"What needs to happen to make this a boon?\" I began taking out some of the weird\
  \ limitations and tweaked the language in the Seeker Arc Option section (yes, a\
  \ seeker arc option!) to make it easier to schedule and play. I began experimenting\
  \ with ways to let the player choose the rewards. I began to open up some stranger\
  \ options, and I began to write something other than a number in the \"GP Gained\"\
  \ box. In the end, the Chronicle sheets began to look like the Chronicle sheets\
  \ should for a high-level module full of clockwork, mutants, and gunpowder: awesome.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Really there's only one thing left to begin: playing <a href=\"/products/btpy92lr\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Module: Wardens of the Reborn Forge</em></a>, now sanctioned for\
  \ the <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety\">Pathfinder Society Organized Play</a> campaign.\
  \ One important thing has come to an end: the long wait for this fine opportunity\
  \ for high-level play. You can download the rules and Chronicle sheet on the <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy92lr\">product page</a> or the <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/about/additionalResources\"\
  >Additional Resources page</a>.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\
