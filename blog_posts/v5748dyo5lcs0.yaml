  \   </div> \n   <p>Since I have been involved with Pathfinder Society, one thing\
  \ I have heard mentioned by players on numerous occasions is that they wish they\
  \ could learn more about Golarion and incorporate that knowledge into their Pathfinder\
  \ Society character. After thinking on different ways to make this happen, it occurred\
  \ to me that Golarion has quite a few holidays mentioned in <a href=\"/store/games/roleplayingGames/p/pathfinderRPG/paizo/pathfinderCompanion/v5748btpy8lvb\"\
  ><i>Faiths of Balance</i></a>, <a href=\"/store/games/roleplayingGames/p/pathfinderRPG/paizo/pathfinderCompanion/v5748btpy8odc\"\
  ><i>Faiths of Corruption</i></a>, <a href=\"/store/games/roleplayingGames/p/pathfinderRPG/paizo/pathfinderCompanion/v5748btpy8j60\"\
  ><i>Faiths of Purity</i></a>, and <a href=\"/store/games/roleplayingGames/p/pathfinderRPG/paizo/pathfinderChronicles/v5748btpy8ief\"\
  ><i>The Inner Sea World Guide</i></a>. As in the real world, where holidays are\
  \ important to all of us, holidays in Golarion are important to our characters and\
  \ the NPCs spread out across the world.</p> \n   <p>Every so often, I will write\
  \ a blog that details a holiday in Golarion to help Pathfinder Society characters\
  \ share in the spirit of the holiday. Creative Director James Jacobs wrote the description\
  \ below for the first holiday in this series: Jestercap, mentioned on page 249 of\
  \ <a href=\"/store/games/roleplayingGames/p/pathfinderRPG/paizo/pathfinderChronicles/v5748btpy8ief\"\
  ><i>The Inner Sea World Guide</i></a>. At the end of the description, you will find\
  \ a special Pathfinder Society Chronicle sheet you can download and apply to a Pathfinder\
  \ Society character.</p> \n   <p>Jestercap occurs at the end of the month of Lamashan,\
  \ traditionally on the 27th (although a few regions have taken to moving the exact\
  \ day around slightly so it always falls on the last Starday of the month, allowing\
  \ people who wish to celebrate in excess to have the following day of rest to recover).\
  \ While Jestercap has been embraced with excited open arms by the gnome communities\
  \ of the Inner Sea region, its original genesis is said to have been in one of Taldor’\
  s coastal cities not long after King Aspex the Even-Tongued broke from the nation,\
  \ significantly weakening Taldor’s power and beginning that nation’s long decline.\
  \ The holiday was originally intended to distract the distraught Taldan populace\
  \ with a night of revelry and comedic entertainment, but the antics of jesters simply\
  \ weren’t enough. Over the course of the first few years, Jestercap evolved from\
  \ a holiday of observation to a holiday of participation. Today, the holiday is\
  \ a time where anyone can pull pranks or jokes or japes on companions, on neighbors,\
  \ and (most typically) on rivals, with the understanding that provided no lasting\
  \ harm is done, any humiliations inflicted before midnight are to be taken in stride.\
  \ Of course, come morning the day after, there are inevitably jokes that went too\
  \ far, and grudges and feuds borne from Jestercap antics have a way of lingering\
  \ for months to follow.</p> \n   <p><strike>Download the Jestercap Boon! - (115\
