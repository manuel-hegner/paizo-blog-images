  description\">First, you realize you are floating.</p>\n              <p>Have you\
  \ always been floating? That feels both accurate and also not quite true. The concept\
  \ of floating is certainly core to your experience, but perhaps not core to who\
  \ you are.</p>\n              <p><em>“We are many things.”</em></p>\n          \
  \    <p>The thought is not yours, but it comes from within you. You are concerned,\
  \ certainly. But not fearful. You are neither surprised by this not-yours thought\
  \ coming from within yourself nor frightened by it. Why does an unknown thought\
  \ not frighten you?</p>\n              <p><em>“You are clinging to the I. You know\
  \ you are just one of many. We are more than the sum of our parts, but we were less\
  \ without you.”</em></p>\n              <p>Intellectually, you suspect that you\
  \ should not be comforted by the fact that more thoughts you do not recognize are\
  \ coming from within the concept you accept as your ‘self.’ But the ideas have a\
  \ familiarity. They are not threatening or alien. You have thought them before…\
  \ or at least felt them being thought.</p>\n              <p>You are not seeing\
  \ or hearing. Just feeling. Feeling the gravitational pull of a far-away body that\
  \ gives you a sense of down, though that is counteracted by something within you.\
  \ Thus, the floating. You have a sense of your body, but cannot quite envision what\
  \ form it takes. Do you have eyes, ears? Is your hide soft and thin, or thick and\
  \ rough?</p>\n              <p><em>“Our hide is what we need it to be. You understand\
  \ this.”</em></p>\n              <p>You realize this is true. Your body is not a\
  \ static thing, not a rock anchored in the mountain of a single form. Your flesh\
  \ and mass and the gasses within you are a set of possibilities. Options, guidelines,\
  \ and possibilities are compressed into every part of you. If you wanted to reach\
  \ out, your tendrils could reach this far or, if you desired, this much farther…\
  </p>\n              <p><em>“Recce?”</em></p>\n              <p>That is <em>also</em>\
  \ not your thought, but it does <em>not</em> come from within you. The word is more\
  \ than a word, it is a concept. A name. A name you should know, that should be familiar,\
  \ but isn’t. Not anymore. How many origins of throughs <em>are</em> there in and\
  \ near your mind?</p>\n              <p><em>“Recce is an old concept. You know this.\
  \ There is no mere Recce anymore,”</em> the within-you thoughts think.</p>\n   \
  \           <p><em>“But… they are in there, aren’t they?”</em> The outside-you thought\
  \ responds.</p>\n              <p>You feel annoyance. Isn’t this <em>your</em> mind?\
  \ Why are there so many other thoughts wandering around within it, having a debate\
  \ without you? And shouldn’t they respect your ownership of this mental space?”\
  </p>\n              <p><em>“No.”</em></p>\n              <p><em>“Yes, of course!”\
  </em></p>\n              <p>That didn’t help.</p>\n              <p><em>“When we\
  \ were separate, we did warn you her presence would confuse us. You insisted on\
  \ having her here. We predicted she would make things more difficult.”</em> The\
  \ inside-you voices make a good point.</p>\n              <p><em>“I’m not making\
  \ things more difficult!”</em> You are unsure if the outside-you voice is correct.\
  \ <em>“I am… was… Recce’s friend. You told us this would be a complex process. They’\
  ve been away so long, spent so much time with us. Recce wanted me here, so now you\
  \ should want me here.”</em></p>\n              <p>You do want Ellethyr here.</p>\n\
  \              <p><em>“Why?”</em></p>\n              <p>She is your friend.</p>\n\
  \              <p><em>“Still?”</em></p>\n              <p>You feel doubt, but only\
  \ briefly. Yes, still. Ellethyr is your friend, so she is the friend of everything\
  \ that contains you. Everything you will become. Everything you choose to be part\
  \ of.</p>\n              <p><em>“We share your mind, but we are not convinced. Why\
  \ are you so sure she is still our friend, when we are now so different?”</em></p>\n\
  \              <p>You explore the body connected to your mind once more, and sounds\
  \ join the sensation of floating. A low, steady hum you know to be an air skimmer’\
  s antigravity engine. You don’t worry about how you know that. The quiet sound of\
  \ your own tendrils—ones you recognize and also many that feel new and different\
  \ to you—swaying and brushing past one another. Even, steady breathing that doesn’\
  t match the sensation of air being taken into your own body.</p>\n             \
  \ <p>You realize it’s Ellethyr’s breathing. She is close enough for you to hear\
  \ her breath.</p>\n              <p>You focus on the idea of your breath, and now\
  \ you add smells to the physical and aural sensations you can perceive. The distinctively\
  \ clean, slightly disinfected smell of a sealed environmental system’s air. A hint\
  \ of worn resin and woven biosilk brings the concept of an insectile haan immediately\
  \ to your mind. The smells of a mid-range air-skimmer, which you know you have smelled\
  \ hundreds of times before. But also something else, something out of place among\
  \ the scents of fittings manufactured from haan materials.</p>\n              <p>It\
  \ is flowery, herbal, faint but distinct. Not a smell normally to be found among\
  \ the haan, or in a mid-range air skimmer. You know it is a scent connected to Castrovel.\
  \ A storm blossom, your mind helpfully offers, which you know is common in the wild\
  \ but also grows in vast greenhouses in the lashunta city-state of Komena. There\
  \ it is pressed to create an oil which is often used to maintain equipment and weapons.\
  \ Used by lashunta soldiers, mechanics, and…</p>\n              <p>And Ellethyr.</p>\n\
  \              <p>The scent connects to a forgotten place in your brain, the physical\
  \ chemicals that combine to lock the smell into brain cells and allow you to access\
  \ a flood of set-aside memories.</p>\n              <p><em>You are exploring the\
  \ ship that will be your new home for weeks, perhaps months. You glide into the\
  \ cargo bay, where a short, stocky lashunta woman is unpacking weapons from a crate.\
  \ The smell of storm blossom oil fills the air. She turns and looks you dead in\
  \ your largest eye. Unflinching, she offers a hand in greeting. “I’m Ellethyr, the\
  \ hired gun of this outfit.” </em></p>\n              <p><em>Ellethyr stands beside\
  \ you in a corridor. Laser bolts flash from the corridor’s far end, but she steps\
  \ in front of you, into the path of the deadly beams. Her armor absorbs much of\
  \ the energy, but not all of it. You trust Ellethyr will protect you as you hack\
  \ the escape hatch’s access codes.</em></p>\n              <p><em>You hover near\
  \ a table, where several bipeds with bilateral symmetry are sitting, eating, laughing.\
  \ Ellethyr is one of them. She pours a dark liquid from a bottle into a mug and\
  \ offers it to you. You extend a tendril out to accept, but it is the gesture that\
  \ matters, not the drink.</em></p>\n              <p>You feel the other motes of\
  \ consciousness sharing your body and your brain follow you to the wave of memories\
  \ unlocked by the trace scent. They take each memory in turn, savoring them like\
  \ delicacies, and sorting them among the memories brought by other pieces of what\
  \ is now the greater <em>you</em>. The integration of these thoughts brings with\
  \ it integration of identity and purpose.</p>\n              <p>The air skimmer’\
  s passenger compartment contains just your collective—a mass of tendrils, organs,\
  \ and biological chemical factories much larger than the one part of you known as\
  \ Recce used to be—and a slightly-concerned looking lashutna woman in heavy armor\
  \ that suits her sturdy frame well. The canopy containing the compartment is clear,\
  \ revealing a vast city of floating rings, intricately linked supports and slowly\
  \ spinning structures, all floating in a vast sea of pink, purple, and crimson clouds.</p>\n\

  \              <p>The collective decides to form a mouth, and you speak.</p>\n \
  \             <p>“Beautiful, isn’t it?”</p>\n              <p>Ellethyr’s expression\
  \ shifts into her trademark lopsided grin.</p>\n              <p>“You okay, Recce-and-friends?”\
  \ You had forgotten the sound of her voice, firm but not hard. Or, at least, you\
  \ had misplaced the memory of the sound.</p>\n              <p>Speech feels awkward.\
  \ You switch back to telepathy.</p>\n              <p><em>“We are fine, friend Ellethyr.\
  \ Any time a collective joins with one that has clung to individuality so long there\
  \ is a process of… adjustment. That will take time, but it is going well.”</em></p>\n\
  \              <p>Her mental communication is as firm as her voice.</p>\n      \
  \        <p><em>“And, do you still think this was a good idea? I know you had concerns\
  \ about some of the things we found in our travels…”</em></p>\n              <p>Your\
  \ Collective brings the knowledge of the part of you that was Recce into focus and\
  \ combines it with the knowledge of the half-dozen other barathus that make up your\
  \ whole. Ancient runes. A shattered weapon that killed suns. Fold gates torn apart\
  \ millions of years ago. Each fact itself holds only modest interest, but when combined\
  \ with the knowledge of all the barathus who had gone out to gather knowledge, all\
  \ returned and joined into your new form…</p>\n              <p>A chill runs down\
  \ the tendrils of your whole collective, and you make a decision that you shall\
  \ be known as Harbinger.</p>\n              <p>Your thought to Ellethyr is tinged\
  \ with worry.</p>\n              <p><em>“Less a good idea than a necessary one.\
  \ We hope we can count on you in the days ahead, as Recce did.”</em></p>\n     \
  \         <p>“Why,” Ellethyr asks aloud. “What’s coming?”</p>\n              <p>You\
  \ form a new mouth to speak a single word.</p>\n              <p>“Devastation.”\
