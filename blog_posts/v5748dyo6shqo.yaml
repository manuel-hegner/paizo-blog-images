  >Year 3: Year of Shattered Sanctuaries</a>, the Pathfinder Society finds itself\
  \ under attack as dangerous threats loom over lodges across the Inner Sea. Fortunately,\
  \ the Society’s recruitment efforts over the past two years have been successful.\
  \ To represent these changes as well as other developments in Pathfinder lore, we’\
  ll be updating several of the Pathfinder Society Achievement Point boons to make\
  \ it easier to create characters of several different ancestries. These adjustments\
  \ will go into effect when Year 3 launches on August 19th.</p> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/f207f4f4-7b11-4475-b270-fff087f98952/071521_CatfolkLibrarian.png\"\

  \ Verdant Wheel unlocked the secret of allowing anyone to establish enough of a\
  \ connection to primal magic to call upon a leshy familiar (as seen in the Achievement\
  \ Points store), word of the faction’s deeds spread among the more powerful nature\

  https://paizo.com/products/btq022x2?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-115-The-Blooming-Catastrophe\"\
  ><em>#1-15: The Blooming Catastrophe</em></a> fought against and ultimately freed\
  \ a group of Abyss-scarred leshys from the influence of the demonic realm, some\
  \ of whom took the opportunity to join the Pathfinder Society. New leshy agents\

  ><em>Lost Omens Character Guide</em></a> without a boon (just like kobolds are freely\
  \ accessible to players who have the Pathfinder Advanced Player’s Guide). While\
  \ we figured that the early access provided by boons was a fair benefit for a reduction\
  \ from 80 AcP to 40 AcP that lizardfolk have, we wanted to grant something special\
  \ for the other half of leshy’s price reduction. If you already have a leshy boon\
  \ at the time that this change goes live, you’ll be able to redownload your existing\
  \ leshy boon with an upgrade, granting the character the benefits of a successful\
  \ resurrect ritual the first time they die, just like the Second Chance boon in\
  \ the Achievement Points store!</p> \n     <br clear=\"all\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/2b1db9e8-0a59-475f-a026-15f86312f6c9/071521_JungleLizardfolk.png\"\

  \ In southern Garund, the Pathfinder Society recently reestablished a long-lapsed\
  \ trading arrangement with the trading city of Ekkeshekar, whose people are predominantly\
  \ lizardfolk (also known as iruxis). Thanks to the successes of the player characters\

  ><em>#1-23: Star-Crossed Court</em></a>, iruxis from in and around Ekkeshekar have\
  \ taken interest in the Pathfinder Society’s mission. The release of Lost Omens:\
  \ The Mwangi Expanse provides plenty of new material for people to craft stories\
  \ for lizardfolk characters from this general region of the world. Additionally,\
