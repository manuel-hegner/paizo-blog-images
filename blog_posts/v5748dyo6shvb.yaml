  \ grab that artifact everyone’s after, and then call your getaway pilot for an extraction\

  ><em>Starfinder One-Shot: The Great Grav-Train Robbery</em></a>, written by Andrew\
  \ White, can be completed in a single 3- to 4-hour session and includes four 6th-level\
  \ pregenerated antiheroes whose stories and motivations tie into the plot of the\
  \ adventure. (Pregenerated characters for this adventure are also available as a\
  \ <a href=\"https://downloads.paizo.com/PZOSF1002E+The+Great+Grav+Train+Robbery+Pregens.pdf\"\
  >free download</a>.) If players create their own characters, they can use the adventure\
  \ background to customize their characters to the adventure. This adventure can\
  \ be easily used on virtual tabletops, run off digital devices, or printed out and\
  \ played at a table.</p> \n     <p><em>Author: Andrew White</em><br> Andrew White\
  \ (he/him) is the lead front-end developer on paizo.com and a Pathfinder and Starfinder\
  \ freelance contributor who has written for projects including the Advanced Player's\
  \ Guide, Bestiary 3, Secrets of Magic, Guns &amp; Gears, Tech Revolution, Drift\
  \ Crisis, and Book of the Dead. He also recently wrote a piece of web fiction about\
  \ a bunch of goblins heroically burning down a village with assistance from a giant\
  \ pig. He has a Twitter where he mostly just retweets his more eloquent colleagues\

  \   <h2>About the Pregenerated Characters </h2> \n     <p>The boss recruited a ragtag\
  \ band of miscreants for this job, all of them active players in Pan’s criminal\
  \ underworld for some time. They consider themselves independent contractors and\
  \ are already familiar with each other by reputation, if not by personal experience.\
  \ While each has their own reasons for taking up a life of crime, they all share\
  \ one thing in common: animosity toward the Ixo Syndicate, which means the opportunity\
  \ to rob them is almost as tempting as the payday.</p> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/86b7da87-5041-46c3-8b9f-332e98285483/PZOSF1002E_TheGreatGravTrainRobberyAdventure.jpg\"\
