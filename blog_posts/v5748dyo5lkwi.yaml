  \ \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Happy Independence Day to our players and volunteers\
  \ in the US, happy “got rid of them” day to the United Kingdom community and a belated\
  \ Happy Canada Day to our neighbors up north! The first whirlwind of convention\
  \ is over and I'm taking a day to rest, relax, and enjoy friends and family. Thursday,\
  \ I'll be back with my nose to the grindstone, working on all the tasks needed to\
  \ bring the Sagamore Ballroom at Gen Con to life, planning out the last few bits\
  \ of travel for 2018, and looking at plans for 2019 and beyond.</p> \n    <p>To\
  \ our volunteers, some good news! I've updated all requests dated through June 17th.\
  \ I'm pulling down the next batch this week and will work on getting those processed.\
  \ So if your waiting on being named a Venture-Officer, haven't seen an update to\
  \ your account, and the request was filed before June 17th, please have the request\
  \ resubmitted. To all new venture officers, welcome to the team. To those leaving\
  \ the venture-officer team, thank you for your efforts in making your gaming community\
  \ thrive!</p> \n    <h2>Campaign Coin</h2> \n    <p>During the staff trip to Origins\
  \ in Columbus, I had the opportunity to recognize two outstanding volunteers. One\
  \ is currently a bedrock of the Cincinnati volunteer community, as well as returning\
  \ Origins volunteer. Please congratulate <b>Brent Bowser</b>, whose new org play\
  \ number is 793.</p> \n    <p>The second recipient is a familiar face in the Northeast\
  \ region. He spent countless hours as a Venture-Lieutenant and then a Venture-Captain,\
  \ as well being a mainstay organizer of org play at the annual <a href=\"http://www.thebodhanagroup.org/about-the-convention\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Save vs. Fear event</a> put on by the Bodhana group. For his\
  \ efforts in the community, we recognized <b>Bobby Harring</b> with a campaign service\
  \ coin #794.</p> \n    <p>If you know a deserving member of your community, please\
  \ email me at organizedplay@paizo.com with their name, location, and the reasons\
  \ you feel they should be recognized for their service. If you are able, please\
  \ include what events they may attend in 2018. This is especially helpful if they\
  \ will be at an event with a member of the organized play team (see further down\
  \ the blog for that list of events.)</p> \n    <h2>Stars and Novas</h2> \n    <p>Convention\
  \ season and a robust gaming schedule came together to provide more Pathfinder Society\
  \ GMs with a chance to earn their 5th Star. To achieve this milestone, GMs facilitate\
  \ 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 are special scenarios,\
  \ as well as run a game for a venture-captain. A conservative estimate of time needed\
  \ to reach 5-stars is 650 hours! To the GMs listed below, congratulations on reaching\
  \ this milestone! To all GMs that achieved 5* status, thank you very much for the\
  \ time and energy you spend running Pathfinder Society games! Your efforts are greatly\
  \ appreciated.</p> \n    <ul>\n     <li>William Cheung</li> \n     <li>Albert Cohen</li>\
  \ \n     <li>Daniel Knipfer</li> \n     <li>Maggie Keeble</li> \n     <li>Ian McHugh</li>\n\
  \    </ul> \n    <p>Starfinder Society has a few GMs that reached their 3-nova milestone\
  \ in the month of June. After reading through much discussion on both what GMs would\
  \ like to see in Starfinder Society and what GMs hope to have for Pathfinder Society\
  \ 2, I think we are close to having a process for awarding a 5th Nova. I'm working\
  \ to put it together for the Org Play team. From there it will go to the Venture-Officer\
  \ team and then to our players. It is my intention to have a commentary period before\
  \ we put it into play and will link any discussion threads in a future blog.</p>\
  \ \n    <h2>Volunteer Opportunities</h2> \n    <p>We still have badges and rooms\
  \ available for Gen Con volunteers. If you are interested in volunteering to run\
  \ events, especially Starfinder Society or the Interactives, please visit <a href=\"\
  https://goo.gl/forms/pxUyPSyeIK9dfwbl2\" target=\"_blank\">the Gen Con 2018 volunteer\
  \ questionnaire</a> for more information and to register. To sweeten the pot a bit\
  \ more, one of the GM rewards is a copy of a book and one of the available choices\
  \ is the Pathfinder Playtest Rulebook.</p> \n    <h2>Convention Listing</h2> \n\
  \    <p>Feedback is that our publishing the convention schedule helps our players\
  \ and GMs allocate their free time. So we will continue to do so! Here is the current\
  \ list of all events that requested support from the Organized Play team. All of\
  \ the conventions on the list maintain some type of web presence, be it website,\
  \ social media page, or Warhorn listing, so if you are interested in attending in\
  \ either capacity, check out their websites or contact the local venture-officer\
  \ for more information! If you know of a convention running Society games that is\
  \ not on this list, encourage the organizer to contact me at <a href=\"mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com\"\
  >organizedplay@paizo.com</a> to discuss their event.</p> \n    <div class=\"callout-block\
