<div itemprop="articleBody">

<div class="blurbCenter" style="display: none;"><a href="/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PathfinderPlaytest-BlogPreview.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PathfinderPlaytest-BlogPreview_360.jpeg"></a></div>

<p itemprop="description">Welcome to the Pathfinder Playtest! Along with all the other members of the Design Team and the rest of the Paizo staff, we'd like to thank you for your time, dedication, and enthusiasm. Without you, we could not hope to make the best possible version of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. Your feedback, thoughts, concerns, and criticism are vital to our process&mdash;we literally can't do it without you!</p>

<p>So, let's talk about all the ways you can help us playtest the newest version of Pathfinder! Starting on Thursday, August 2, make sure to grab the free PDF of the <em>Pathfinder Playtest Rulebook</em> and make your first character. If you are planning on being your group's Game Master, download the free adventure <em>Doomsday Dawn</em> and start reading through Part 1 of the adventure. Make sure to also grab the free <em>Pathfinder Playtest Bestiary</em> PDF, since it contains all of the adversaries you will need to run the adventure.</p>

<p>Once you've gathered a group together, plan on playing regularly over the next few months as we make our way through all seven parts of the adventure. <em>Doomsday Dawn</em> is broken up into seven distinct chapters, each of which tests different levels and different aspects of the game. Make sure to set aside some time to give us your feedback as well. We are including surveys this time around to collect your thoughts and help you get your feedback to us as quickly and efficiently for you as possible, so taking part in the playtest could not be easier!</p>

<h2>Playtesting with Doomsday Dawn</h2>

<ol><li>Before play begins, make sure to download the Playtest Tracking PDF (which will be available starting Thursday, August 2) to help you keep track of a few important pieces of information that we'll ask about later in the surveys. Note that the PDF contains a sheet for GMs and a sheet for players.</li>
<li>Play a chapter of <em>Doomsday Dawn</em>. We highly recommend you start with Part 1 and play the adventure in order so that you fully experience the story, but if you can only play some of the parts, that's OK!</li>
<li>Fill out the surveys that correspond to the chapter you just played (either the GM survey or the player survey, plus general feedback if you want to give some free responses). You'll be able to find links to the surveys at pathfinderplaytest.com starting on Thursday, August 2. Surveys for Parts 2-7 will go live as we progress through the playtest (see the playtest schedule below). We recommend filling out each survey soon after you play the chapter so the memory is fresh, but don't worry about memorizing any fine details; that's what the Tracking PDF is for!</li>
<li>Go back to Step 2 and play another part of the adventure until you're done with Doomsday Dawn! We'll be focusing on each part in order, according to the playtest schedule.</li></ol>

<h2>Playtesting with the Pathfinder Society</h2>

<ol><li>Before play begins, make sure to grab the Society Playtest Tracking PDF (which will be available starting Thursday, August 2) to help you keep track of a few important pieces of information that we'll ask about later in the surveys.</li>
<li>Play one of the Pathfinder Society playtest scenarios.</li>
<li>Fill out the survey corresponding to the scenario you just played (the player or GM survey, plus the general feedback survey if you want to give some free responses). We recommend filling out any surveys soon after you play the scenario so the memory is fresh, but don't worry about memorizing any fine details; that's what the Tracking PDF is for.</li>
<li>Go back to Step 2 and play a different scenario. You can also replay any of the scenarios to try out a new class, ancestry, or other combination!</li></ol>

<h2>Playtesting with Custom Adventures</h2>
<p>There aren't any step-by-step instructions for playtesting using your own adventures. You're in charge! Use the rules in the <em>Pathfinder Playtest Rulebook</em> and <em>Pathfinder Playtest Bestiary</em> to create any sort of adventure you want. To make sure your data are as strong as possible, try to keep to the guidelines in the rulebook and avoid setting any house rules, as these limit what we can learn from your responses. For instance, if you run a monster much stronger than the guidelines and then report that the PCs were easily defeated, we can't tell how they might have fared under normal conditions. Other than that, the sky's the limit.</p>

<h2>General Surveys</h2>
<p>In addition to the adventure-specific surveys, we will also be releasing general surveys that we would like everyone to complete, focusing on ancestries, character classes, play mechanics, and more! We want to give you a chance to playtest a bit before we launch those surveys, but when they go live, you'll find the links with the other surveys at <a href = "http://pathfinderplaytest.com">pathfinderplaytest.com</a>.</p>

<h2>Discussions</h2>
<p>In addition to responding via the surveys, you can engage with other players and designers over on our forums, discussing the rules of the game and possibilities for the future. While we want to focus on actual play feedback, we also want to hear your ideas about the game.</p>

<h2>Playtest Schedule</h2>
<p>The playtest officially gets under way on August 2, 2018, and runs through the end of the year, closing on December 31, 2018. During that time, we will be focusing on various parts of the Doomsday Dawn adventure, making our way toward the dramatic conclusion in mid-November. Check out the following schedule so you can plan your games accordingly.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><b><em>Doomsday Dawn</em>, Part 1</b>: 1st-level characters, playtest begins 8/2/18<br />
<b><em>Doomsday Dawn</em>, Part 2</b>: 4th-level characters, playtest begins 8/27/18<br />
<b><em>Doomsday Dawn</em>, Part 3</b>: 7th-level characters, playtest begins 9/10/18<br />
<b><em>Doomsday Dawn</em>, Part 4</b>: 9th-level characters, playtest begins 9/24/18<br />
<b><em>Doomsday Dawn</em>, Part 5</b>: 12th-level characters, playtest begins 10/8/18<br />
<b><em>Doomsday Dawn</em>, Part 6</b>: 14th-level characters, playtest begins 10/22/18<br />
<b><em>Doomsday Dawn</em>, Part 7</b>: 17th-level characters, playtest begins 11/5/18</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Watch Us and Chat Live</h2>

<p>You can also follow along with the playtest on the <a href = "https://www.twitch.tv/officialpaizo" target = "_blank">Paizo Twitch stream</a>. Once the playtest is underway, we will be hosting a live stream every week where we play the game and talk about the results of the playtest so far. Videos from that stream will be archived on our <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/PaizoInc" target = "_blank">YouTube channel</a> if you miss the live broadcast. We will also be doing a playtest wrap-up every two weeks as we move from one part of the playtest adventure to the next. Expect to hear all about the results of the playtest and what changes are being made based on your feedback and comments!</p>

<p>How do you plan on participating in the playtest? Do you have any other questions about the process you'd like to ask us? Let us know in the comments below!</p>

<b>Spoiler:</b> <input type="button" value="Show" class="spoilerButton" onclick="toggleSpoiler(this)"><div class="spoiler-text">
<p>While the PCs were working hard to obtain the approval of First Emperor Taldaris's spirit in Axis (as recounted in John Compton's excellent adventure, <a href="/products/btpy9x04?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-The-Reaper-s-Right-Hand"><em>The Reaper's Right Hand</em></a>), assassins murdered Princess Eutropia!</p>

<p>Some of these conflicts are intellectual, while others are definitely not.<br /><i>Illustration by Miguel Regod&oacute;n Harkness</i></p></div>

<p><i>Illustration by Miguel Regod&oacute;n Harkness</i></p></div>

<p>This mighty deed is merely the first step in a thrilling adventure that will put high-level heroes to the test. Amber assembled a ton of exceptional encounters&mdash;so many that I'm not sure how she fit them all into a single adventure&mdash;and Crystal tied them very neatly to the rest of the adventure path. Several of the PCs' former enemies and allies influence this story, but it is the legendary figures from Taldor's history that really steal the show. You may have noticed the, well, shall we say, <i>suspiciously favorable</i> histories of Taldan emperors in the inside cover of each of the adventure path's volumes. The PCs meet each of them here, vying with these legendary spirits for control of young Prince Carrius's soul.</p>

<p>It's quite common for us to end an adventure path with a "Continuing the Campaign" article, and War for the Crown is no different. In addition to providing adventure hooks regarding several loose ends, Crystal's article presents an in-depth subsystem to determine what kind of ruler Eutropia becomes at the end of the campaign. So much of Eutropia's legacy is tied up in the PCs' decisions and victories throughout the entire adventure path that her ultimate leadership style rests on their actions. Will history call her Eutropia the Kind, Eutropia the Builder, Eutropia the Measured&hellip;or even Eutropia the Bloody?</p>

<p>Bring your War for the Crown campaign to a stunning conclusion and create a lasting legacy in your world!</p>

<p>The Ironfang Invasion Adventure Path pits the PCs against a fearsome hobgoblin army known as the Ironfang Legion. Many of the boons Luis and Eleanor wrote for this militant adventure tie into building a militia to fight back against the Legion, recruiting NPCs to your cause and gaining a suite of thematic abilities suitable for any warleader. Don't worry though, the boons from these Chronicles are still going to be useful and effective if you decide to play in campaign mode and apply them to a different character who never sallied forth against the Legion!</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderSociety/20180725-RuinsofAzlant.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderSociety/20180725-RuinsofAzlant_500.jpeg"></a></div>

<p>Ruins of Azlant will take you to colonies and ancient "ruins." The Chronicle sheets and boons reflect the Azlanti connection, offering everything from allies on and near the island of Ancorato to extremely rare <i>ioun stones</i>! Once again, while the boons provided by these Chronicle sheets are written to help enhance your characters' connections to the story and setting, they'll still be powerful and useful in their own right if you decide to apply them to another character after completing the Adventure Path. You can locate the sanctioning documents from the individual<a href="/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/ironfangInvasion">Ironfang Invasion</a> and <a href="/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/ruinsOfAzlant">Ruins of Azlant</a> product pages and <a href = "/pathfindersociety/rpg/additional">Additional Resources</a>.</p>

<p>With the Ironfang Invasion and Ruins of Azlant sanctioning wrapped and ready for your perusal, we've got a few much-sought-after modules that are primed for our next round of sanctioning releases. Until then, happy gaming, everyone!</p>

  <h1>Multiclassing and Archetypes</h1>
  <p class="date"><time datetime="2018-07-27T19:00:00Z">Jul 27, 2018, 12:00 pm</time></p>
  <p itemprop="description">One of the trickiest parts of the rules is multiclassing. At its heart, multiclassing allows you to build almost any character you can envision, taking parts from multiple classes to build the perfect version of your character. Making these rules play well with the rest of the game, unfortunately, has always been a challenge. Concepts that really should work together just fell flat, leaving you with a character who could not perform at its level and keep pace with single class characters. This was especially the case for certain classes, like most spellcasters, that had a central class feature or features that you would fall sharply behind in if you weren't constantly progressing in that class.</p>

<div itemprop="articleBody">

<div class="blurbCenter" style="display: none;"><a href="/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PathfinderPlaytest-BlogPreview.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PathfinderPlaytest-BlogPreview_360.jpeg"></a></div>

<p itemprop="description">One of the trickiest parts of the rules is multiclassing. At its heart, multiclassing allows you to build almost any character you can envision, taking parts from multiple classes to build the perfect version of your character. Making these rules play well with the rest of the game, unfortunately, has always been a challenge. Concepts that really should work together just fell flat, leaving you with a character who could not perform at its level and keep pace with single class characters. This was especially the case for certain classes, like most spellcasters, that had a central class feature or features that you would fall sharply behind in if you weren't constantly progressing in that class.</p>

<p>Suffice to say, when it came time to redesign the system for the Pathfinder Playtest, we knew that multiclassing needed work.</p>

<p>Then came the <a href="/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkvj?Archetypes-for-All">rules for archetypes</a>. The new design for this emblematic part of the game allows archetypes to be taken by any class, so you can decide exactly how much you want to invest into an alternative path for your character. The more we worked on that system, the more it began to sound like it shared almost exactly the same goals as multiclassing. Our thought was, shouldn't they just be the same system?</p>

<p>Multiclass archetypes are one of the more experimental parts of the Pathfinder Playtest. So much so that there are only four of them in the book, one for cleric, one for fighter, one for rogue, and one for wizard. Just like ordinary archetypes, you must take a special dedication feat to gain access to the archetype, but you cannot be of the same class as the archetype (so you can't take the rogue dedication feat if you are already a rogue). Let's take a look at one of these feats.</p>

<blockquote>
  
<p class = "stat-block-title">Wizard Dedication <span class = "stat-block-cr">Feat 2</span></p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">Archetype, Dedication, Multiclass</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Prerequisites</b> Intelligence 16, trained in Arcana</p>
<hr style = "margin: 0.5rem 0;" />
<p class = "stat-block-1">You cast spells like a wizard and gain a spellbook containing four arcane cantrips of your choice. You gain access to the Cast a Spell activity and the Material Casting, Somatic Casting, and Verbal Casting actions. You can prepare two cantrips each day from those found in your spellbook. You're trained in spell rolls and spell DCs for casting arcane spells and in attacks you make with arcane spells. Your key spellcasting ability for these spells is Intelligence. You can use wands, scrolls, and staves, but only for spells of a spell level you can cast. Arcana is a signature skill for you.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Special</b> You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the wizard archetype.</p>
  
</blockquote>
    
<p>Right away, this lets you cast a few simple cantrips; allows you to use wands, scrolls, and staves; and makes Arcana a signature skill for you (meaning you can advance your proficiency in the skill to master and legendary). Like other dedication feats, once you've taken Wizard Dedication, you gain access to other wizard archetype feats, each of which makes you a more powerful master of the arcane arts. Take a look.</p>

<blockquote>
 
<p class = "stat-block-title">Basic Wizard Spellcasting <span class = "stat-block-cr">Feat 4</span></p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">Archetype</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Prerequisites</b> Wizard Dedication</p>
<hr style = "margin: 0.5rem 0;" />
<p class = "stat-block-1">Add two level 1 spells to your spellbook. You gain a single level1 spell slot that you can use to prepare a level 1 spell from your spellbook. At 6th level, add two level 2 spells to your spellbook, and you gain a level 2 spell slot that you can use to prepare a level 2 spell from your spellbook. At 8th level, add two level 3 spells to your spellbook, and you gain a level 3 spell slot that you can use to prepare a level 3 spell from your spellbook.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">Even though you can cast spells, the spell level of your cantrips and arcane powers is half your level rounded up.</p>
  
</blockquote>

<p>This feat pays dividends all the way up through 8th level, giving you more spells you can cast, and if you take it later on in your career, you get all of that spellcasting all at once. Better still, there are additional feats you can take to gain spells of up to 8th level! But let's say you want to be even more of a wizard&mdash;you want to get some of the other class features that make wizards fun to play. Take a look at these feats.</p>

<blockquote>
  
<p class = "stat-block-title">Arcane School <span class = "stat-block-cr">Feat 4</span></p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">Archetype</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Prerequisite</b> Wizard Dedication</p>
<hr style = "margin: 0.5rem 0;" />
<p class = "stat-block-1">Select one school of magic from those found in the wizard class. You gain the level 1 school power tied to your school and a pool of Spell Points equal to your Intelligence modifier that you can use to cast that power.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">If you already have a pool of Spell Points, use the higher ability score to determine the pool, as normal, and your Spell Point pool increases by 1.</p>

<p></p>

<p class = "stat-block-title">Basic Arcana <span class = "stat-block-cr">Feat 4</span></p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">Archetype</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Prerequisites</b> Wizard Dedication</p>
<hr style = "margin: 0.5rem 0;" />
<p class = "stat-block-1">Gain a level 1 or level 2 wizard feat of your choice.</p>

<p></p>

<p class = "stat-block-title">Advanced Arcana <span class = "stat-block-cr">Feat 6</span></p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">Archetype</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Prerequisites</b> Basic Arcana</p>
<hr style = "margin: 0.5rem 0;" />
<p class = "stat-block-1">Gain one wizard feat. For the purposes of meeting its prerequisites, your wizard level is equal to half your level.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Special</b> You can select this feat more than once. Each time you select it, you gain a new wizard feat.</p>
  
</blockquote>

<p>There's even a feat that gives you additional spell slots of every level except for your two highest, giving you more versatility in your spellcasting. It's important to note that these powers come at the cost of some of the flexibility of your primary class, but not at the cost of core features. A cleric who multiclasses into fighter will keep all of her spellcasting abilities, but she will have to trade out some of the feats that allow her to be better at casting <i>heal</i> or at using domain powers in exchange for increased proficiency in weapons and armor, added hit points, and the ability to make attacks of opportunity. You might even choose to multiclass into several classes. You could play a cleric who, in addition to all her cleric spells, also has up to 8th-level druid spells and 8th-level wizard spells, though such a three-tradition spellcaster would have few cleric feats to speak of!</p>

<p>Well, that about covers the rules for multiclassing in the Pathfinder Playtest. If these archetypes work, you can expect to see one for each class in the final version of the game, giving you the flexibility to build characters that draw on more than one class to make their concept click. We hope you'll give these a try during the playtest and let us know what you think!</p>

<p itemprop="description">While the hundreds upon hundreds of weapons, suits of armor, and items in <a href="/products/btpya1rr?Starfinder-Armory"><i>Starfinder Armory</i></a>, can <i>technically </i>exist in a vacuum (space joke!), none of them amount to much without a skilled user.

Plus there's a new archetype that brings the Augmented, a growing cultural movement of self-modification, to any character who wants to hack their body to perfection.</p>

<p>Envoys get a slew of improvisations and expertise talents that make them even stronger team supports, granting allies extra actions to quaff serums or reload weapons. They can also become even better battlefield medics, demolition experts, and computer whizzes!</p>

<p>Mechanics learn new tricks and even get additional drone mod options: you might teach your drone the Barricade feat or install cybernetic or magitech augmentations into its chassis. What's magitech, you ask? A new type of augmentation with dozens of options, included in <i>Armory</i>!</p>

<p>Mystics forge a new connection, which introduces two new spells (marked with asterisks) that any mystic can learn:</p>

<div class = "blurb360"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/20180726-HumanMystic.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/20180726-HumanMystic_180.jpeg"></a>

<blockquote>

<p class = "stat-block-title">GENETURGE</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">You are connected to the very building blocks of life, adept at altering your DNA code and that of others. You may see augmentation as a natural part of evolution, or the ultimate form of self-improvement that drives life towards enlightenment, or even a perversion of the natural order undertaken to venerate dread gods. With your enhanced understanding of biotech, you might be a famous self-help expert, a sinister fleshwarper, or an adaptable xenoseeker surveying mysterious planets in the Vast.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Associated Deities:</b> Eloritu, Oras, Triune (Casandalee), Yaraesa</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Associated Skills:</b> Life Science and Medicine</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Spells:</b> 1st&mdash;<i>detect augmentation*</i>, 2nd&mdash;<i>spider climb</i>, 3rd&mdash;<i>remove affliction</i>, 4th&mdash;<i>reject augmentation</i>*, 5th&mdash;<i>modify memory</i>, 6th&mdash;<i>regenerate</i></p>

</blockquote>

<p>Operatives find more than a dozen new exploits, including pistol whip, knee shot, and utility belt. A new operative specialization, gadgeteer, emphasizes expertise in Engineering and Sleight of Hand.</p>

<p>Solarians have new revelations, including two new zenith revelations! With one, you can transform into a swarm (as the monster subtype) of thousands of flaming pinpoints; the other lets you pull a creature outside the confines of space and time. Like you do.</p>

<p>Soldiers get a new fighting style, called shock and awe, that focuses on overwhelming enemies with auditory and visual stimuli. They also have a bevy of gear boosts, including ones that enhance their use of disintegrator and sniper weapons (and yes&mdash;powered armor!).</p>

<p>Technomancers score new magic hacks (expend a spell slot to forge a magical, grenade-like matrix of volatile energy!) and spells (including <i>animate armor</i>, which, yes, can work on powered armor!).</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline">Pathfinder Society Playtest Scenarios</h1>

<p class="date">Wednesday, July 25, 2018</p>

<div itemprop="articlebody">

<div class="blurbCenter" style="display:none;"><a href="/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PFSUpdates2.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PFSUpdates2_180.jpeg"></a></div>

<p itemprop="description">One of the advantages of this team's creating organized play scenarios for the better part of a decade (it surprises me that I can truthfully say that) is that we're now very familiar with how Pathfinder Society scenarios are laid out, how we word certain things, and countless other nuances. Introducing Starfinder Society gave us (especially Thurston Hillman) lots of opportunities to tweak our models to fit a new game system, and in many ways it prepared us for the changes we've made in Pathfinder's Second Edition. Sure, some of these are editorial minutiae like no longer splitting whether we use the preposition "on" or "to" when referring to bonuses on rolls versus bonuses to static values (e.g. AC or CMD). Others are more apparent, such as how we arrange encounters, where we place tactics, and how we calculate treasure. Learning these new styles and adapting them to organized play has been an experience, and we're hoping that this is a first step toward presenting great scenarios in the upcoming campaign.</p>

<p>One of the most unexpected updates for us was how Second Edition shapes those Knowledge checks that appear at the beginning of most scenarios (right after the adventure briefing). In the current edition's Pathfinder Society scenarios, these provide increasingly specific, esoteric, and/or useful information based on the result of a PC's Knowledge check. Some of Second Edition's underlying math, <a href="/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkod?Critical-Hits-and-Critical-Failures">the different levels of success</a>, and other factors make it so that this start-of-scenario tradition has to evolve, and Michael, Linda, Mark, and I brainstormed lots of different approaches to handling these opening skill checks to learn more. We found that there's not one perfect solution in theory, so we've used a different model in each of the playtest adventures releasing in August. As we launch these scenarios, we'll also be posting survey links to solicit your feedback. As you can imagine, we're eager to hear how each of these information-gathering systems worked for your table.</p>

<p>But hey, that's enough nuts and bolts. If you'd like to know more about the Pathfinder Society playtest process, check out the <a href="/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkxl?Pathfinder-Society-3-Organized-Playtest">Organized Playtest</a> blog. Let's dive into the stories!</p>

<p>The early public previews of Pathfinder's second edition have relied on two particular adventures. Most of our playtesters so far have experienced our demo, in which the PCs clash with a cruel Asmodean zealot and his small army of undead. Beginning at PaizoCon, we also debuted <i><a href="/products/btpya1y3?Pathfinder-Society-Playtest-Scenario-1-The-Rose-Street-Revenge">Pathfinder Society Playtest #1: The Rose Street Revenge</a></i> as a lottery event that's also appeared at Origins and PaizoCon UK. In the wake of <a href="/products/btpy9tld?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-900-Assault-on-Absalom">Absalom's grand manumission event</a>(kudos, Liberty's Edge faction!), the city's former slaves have found new homes there as the newest free citizens. However, someone seems to hold a grudge. Known as the Rose Street Killer, this villain has systematically killed or abducted these freed people, and the latest victim is a recent recruit of the Pathfinder Society. In this series of four quests for 1st-level characters, the PCs follow exciting leads in order to unmask the killer and put an end to the attacks once and for all. Not only do these adventures involve a visit to the Society's unlikely kobold allies beneath Absalom, but there's also a chance to explore the Puddles, a flooded district where volunteer Muckrucker guards (like the one illustrated here by Kenneth Camaro) keep the peace. We expect this quest series by Leo Glass, Thurston Hillman, Joe Pasini, and Linda Zayas-Palmer will be many players' first and fun introduction to Second Edition.</p>

<p>Linda took the lead on our next scenario, so let's hear from her directly.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The first of our offerings for 5th-level characters is <a href="/products/btpya1y4?Pathfinder-Society-Playtest-Scenario-2-Raiders-of-Shrieking-Peak"><i>Pathfinder Playtest Scenario #2: Raiders of Shrieking Peak</i></a>, by developer Luis Loza. When Pathfinder agent Inisa Ardaali recovered a relic from Iomedae's ascension, she took every precaution to get it back to Absalom safely. Instead of sailing directly into Absalom's harbor, she landed in nearby Diobel and hired a nondescript caravan to cover the rest of the distance overland. Despite her preparations, however, her caravan did not reach its destination. They fell prey to an unexpected group of bandits, leaving the survivors to limp back to Diobel empty-handed. The PCs pick up the robbers' trail and set off into the perilous wilderness. Will they forge new alliances with those they find along they way or let their blades do the talking? It's up to you to decide. How would you respond to this fellow swooping down out of the sky, as illustrated by Josef Kucera?</p>

<br /><i>Illustration by Javier Charro</i></div>

<p>Want more 5th-level adventure possibilities? Look no further than <a href="/products/btpya1y5?Pathfinder-Society-Playtest-Scenario-3-Arclords-Envy"><i>Pathfinder Society Playtest #3: Arclord's Envy</i></a> by Lyz Liddell. This adventure does many things we've always dreamed of: it's a story that takes place in Nex, resoundingly reflects its setting in the encounters, and at long last shows off the Nexus House (the oldest Society lodge outside of Absalom)! What's more, we've introduced the lodge's three caretakers, most notably the esteemed gnome Sebnet Sanserkoht (illustrated here by Javier Charro). The 5th-level PCs are in charge of a daring whodunit that hinges on a recently discovered text written by the archmage Nex himself. This is no mundane investigation, though&mdash;not in a capital city run by wizards, maintained by elementals, and guarded by a pair of titanic golems! Because it's possible to replay these playtest scenarios for credit, this scenario includes some flexibility for the GM to vary parts of the investigation and the culprits themselves in order to keep players on their toes every time.</p>

<p>And don't forget that we'll also have a 10th-level scenario coming out in September! In the meantime, get ready for three great adventures to kick off the playtest at Gen Con in style!</p>

<p>(And surveys. Don't forget the surveys!)</p>

<p class="date">Tuesday, July 24, 2018</p>

<div itemprop="articleBody">

<div class="blurbCenter" style="display: none;"><a href="/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PathfinderPlaytest-BlogPreview.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PathfinderPlaytest-BlogPreview_360.jpeg"></a></div>

<p itemprop="description">As some of you have no doubt noticed, we haven't said much about half-elves and half-orcs except to confirm that they'll be part of the Pathfinder Playtest. Of all of the ancestry choices in Pathfinder, these were two of the trickiest to design. With the way that the feats are structured, it would be easy enough to just list the feats from both parents (plus some unique options), but that quickly led to cherry-picking the best of both. Moreover, that approach didn't address the base statistics of the ancestry that are very important to overall balance, such as starting hit points and speed.</p>

<p>In the end, we decided to make both half-elves and half-orcs an addition to the human ancestry. You start by selecting human, then take the corresponding heritage feat to represent your diverse ancestry. Let's take a look at the half-elf feat.</p>

<blockquote>
  
<p class = "stat-block-title">Half-Elf <span class = "stat-block-cr">Feat 1</span></p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">Heritage, Human</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">Either one of your parents was an elf, or one or both were half-elves. You have pointed ears and other telltale signs of elven heritage. You gain the elf trait. Select two of the following benefits: elven speed (increase your Speed by 5 feet), elven tongue (add Elven to your list of languages), gifted speaker (you are trained in Diplomacy), or low-light vision (you can see in dim light as well as you can in bright light). In addition, you can select elf, half-elf, and human feats whenever you gain an ancestry feat.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Special</b> You can select this feat twice. The second time, it loses the heritage trait and you gain the other two benefits.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This approach comes with a number of advantages. First off, it lets us make a half-elf that truly does have some of the advantages of both ancestries, while still allowing you to pick the parts that you think best represent your character's upbringing. Grew up among elves? Then picking up the Elven language makes sense. Had to explain yourself to the humans you grew up with? Then being trained in Diplomacy might be the way to go. As with all of our ancestries, we wanted the choice of being a half-elf or half-orc to be meaningful to your character and expressive of the backstory that you've decided to create. This ancestry feat gives a lot of benefits; to get similar benefits, you would normally use a general feat to pick up Adoptive Ancestry, which grants you access to the ancestry feats from another ancestry (as long as they don't have physiological requirements) to represent your deep connection to another ancestry's culture and traditions. However, being a half-elf gives you access to human feats, elf feats, and half-elf feats (including feats with physiological components), as well as two additional benefits.</p>

<p>At this point, you might be saying, wait, what about humans in general? Let's take a look at some of their options. At its core, human is a very flexible ancestry, with choices like Natural Ambition to gain an extra 1st-level class feat, General Training to gain an extra 1st-level general feat, and Skilled to gain training in two additional skills. However, humans also have fun options for particular builds, like this one for a character who wants to reduce the penalties for being untrained.</p>

<blockquote>
  
<p class = "stat-block-title">Clever Improviser <span class = "stat-block-cr">Feat 1</span></p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">Human</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">You've learned how to handle situations where you're out of your depth. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to checks for skills in which you're untrained.</p>

</blockquote>
    
<p>Of course, this approach for half-elves and half-orcs means that we needed to include a few orc feats in the book so players would get the complete experience of being a half-orc. Take a look at this classic feat.</p>

<blockquote>
      
<p class = "stat-block-title">[[R]] Orc Ferocity <span class = "stat-block-cr">Feat 1</span></p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">Orc</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Frequency</b> once per day</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Trigger</b> You're reduced to 0 Hit Points.</p>
<hr style = "margin: 0.5rem 0;" />
<p class = "stat-block-1">Fierceness in battle runs through your blood, and you refuse to fall from your injuries. When this feat is triggered, you avoid being knocked out and remain at 1 Hit Point.</p>

<p>This allows the half-orc to stay in the fight after taking a felling blow, even a really big hit or a critically failed save against a dragon's breath attack!</p>
<p>In addition to allowing you to choose any feat from both ancestries, we were also able to design a few ancestry feats specifically for half-elves and half-orcs. Take a look at this half-elf feat.</p>

<blockquote>
  
<p class = "stat-block-title">Inspire Imitation <span class = "stat-block-cr">Feat 5</span></p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">Half-Elf</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">You inspire your allies to great feats through your own actions. Whenever you critically succeed at a skill check, you automatically qualify to take the Aid reaction when attempting to help an ally at the same skill check, even without spending an action to prepare to do so.</p>

</blockquote>
  
<p>This means that when you critically succeed, you can Aid your ally at no extra cost to yourself, which is particularly useful if your ally needs some help doing something at which you excel.</p>

<p>Beyond what this means for half-elves and half-orcs, using an ancestry feat to unlock a more diverse heritage gives us a lot of options for the future. For instance, aasimars, tieflings, and other planar scions come from a wide variety of ancestries in Golarion, instead of just defaulting to human. In Pathfinder First Edition, there's a sidebar to that effect, but it provides no mechanical adjustments for non-human planar scions beyond their size category. The playtest treatment would allow you to build a character whose ancestry really reflects their combined heritage. And if your setting has half-elves and half-orcs where the other parent isn't human, say half-orc/half-dwarf characters, you can just allow the half-orc feat for dwarf characters and the rest of the work is already taken care of. This also opens up a lot of design space (in the form of feats) to explore what otherworldly parentage might mean, giving you different options based on what type of outsider has influenced your heritage, similar to the popular subcategories of aasimar and tieflings (pitborn, musetouched, and so on). Having a solar in the family might grant access to entirely different feats than if your ancestors were blessed by a hound archon.</p>

<p>Now, this approach is a little different than what we've done in the past, so we are going to be asking a few questions about this through surveys during the playtest. We're keen to hear what you think about half-elves and half-orcs in the playtest. Why not roll one up and give it a try?</p>

<div class="blurbCenter" style="display: none;"><a href="/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20180723-Preview.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20180723-Preview_360.jpeg"></a></div>

<p itemprop="description">Druids are practitioners of primal magic, which blends vital essence (the essence of life, instinct, and faith) with material essence (the essence of matter and the natural world). Thus, primal traditions are rooted in an instinctual connection with and faith in the surrounding world: the cycle of day and night, the turning of the seasons, and the natural selection of predator and prey. Druids are the iconic primal spellcasters; they call upon the power of nature for magic through their deep faith, as opposed to primal sorcerers, who harness the power of fey or other natural creatures that flows through their blood to access the same sorts of primal energies.</p>

<p>Since this is the last class, before we go deeper into the druid's mechanics, I want to show you some extra pieces each class has that you might not know about. Every class entry starts with some bullet points to help you get a feel for what playing the class might be like.</p>

<h2>Playing a Druid</h2>
<p>Players of druid characters might approach gameplay in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>During combat, you call upon the forces of nature to defeat your enemies and protect your allies. You can cast spells drawing upon primal magic to summon deadly animals to fight at your side, grant resilience to you and your friends, or heal their wounds. Depending on your bond to nature, you might also call upon powerful elemental magic or even change shape into a terrifying beast to fight with tooth and claw.</li>
<li>During social encounters, you represent balance and a reasoned approach to problems, looking for solutions that not only are best for the natural world, but also allow the creatures within it to live in harmony and peace. You often propose compromises that allow both sides to gain what they truly need, even if they can't have all that they desire.</li>
<li>In exploration mode, your skills in nature are invaluable. You can track down enemies, navigate through the wilderness, or use your spells to detect any magical auras around you. You might even ask wild animals to assist your group in your travels with their extraordinary senses and scouting abilities.</li>
<li>In downtime mode, you might craft magic items or potions. Alternatively, your tie to nature might lead you to tend to an area of the wild, befriending its beasts and healing the wounds caused by civilization. You might even attempt to teach people sustainable techniques that allow them to subsist off the land without harming the natural balance.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Roleplaying a Druid</h2>
<p>Druids are the living embodiment of nature, acting as its agent; you protect the wild places from harm and speak for their interests in more civilized lands.</p>

<h3>If You're a Druid, You Likely...</h3>
<ul>
<li>Have a deep and meaningful respect for the power of nature.</li>
<li>Are in constant awe of the natural world, eager to share it with others but cautious of their influence.</li>
<li>Treat plants and animals as allies in your quest, working with them toward your goals.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Others Probably...</h3>
<ul>
<li>View you as a representative of nature, and might even assume you can control it.</li>
<li>Assume you're a recluse who avoids society and cities, preferring to live in the wild.</li>
<li>Treat you as a mystic, similar to a priest, but answering only to the forces of nature.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Illustration by Wayne Reynolds</i></p></div>

<h2>Spellcasting</h2>
<p>Druids are full prepared spellcasters, able to cast the same number of spells per day as the cleric and bard, rather than gaining extra spells through bloodlines or schools as the sorcerer and wizard do. However, just as the cleric has channel energy and the bard has compositions, the druid has more than enough tricks up her sleeve to make her a primal powerhouse. And figuring those out starts with...</p>

<h2>Orders</h2>
<p>As the druid's initial architect, Jason pulled the concept of orders from the sidelines of lore directly into the spotlight, making your choice of order a major part of your druid. As with the bard's muse, you can choose abilities that belong to another order, but unlike for the bard, you gain extra benefits from feats and abilities that belong to your own order, incentivizing you to check out your own order's feats first. An order member gains a new skill and an order power that druids of other orders can't gain, and each order adds its own component to the basic druid anathema forbidding actions like despoiling nature. The four orders presented in the playtest are animal, leaf, storm, and wild, though more orders are all but certain to arise.</p>

<h3>Animal</h3>
<p>An animal druid (known by names like druid of the claw or druid of the wing depending on her preferred animal) has a strong connection to animals. She is trained in Athletics, which is a signature skill for her. She also gains the <i>heal animal</i> order power (exclusive to that members of order) and the Animal Companion feat. Committing wanton cruelty to animals or killing them unnecessarily is anathema to her. (This doesn't prevent her from defending herself against animals or killing them cleanly for food.)</p>

<p>This is the order that's all about having the coolest animal companion. Other druids can easily get an animal companion (and they're a solid choice for all druids) and take the same upgrade feats, but with each feat, the animal order druid will get something cool or extra for the animal. As an example, an animal druid's companion can have multiple specializations, which are like animal companion archetypes, if the animal druid commits more to this path.</p>

<h3>Leaf</h3>
<p>A druid of the leaf reveres plants and the bounty of nature, acting as a caretaker and warden for the wilderness, teaching sustainable techniques, and helping areas regrow after disasters or negligent humanoid expansion. She is trained in Diplomacy, which is a signature skill for her. She also gains the Leshy Familiar druid feat and the <i>goodberry</i> order power (exclusive to that members of order). Committing wanton cruelty to plants or killing plants unnecessarily is anathema to her. (This doesn't prevent her from defending herself against plants or harvesting them if necessary for survival.)</p>

<p>This style of druid is all about plants, with options including Verdant Metamorphosis, where you flat-out become a plant, and the druid of the leaf's leshy familiar, which has more powers than a typical familiar. Let's check out Verdant Metamorphosis to see a special benefit only druids of the leaf receive:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class = "stat-block-title">Verdant Metamorphosis <span class = "stat-block-cr">Feat 18</span></p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">Druid</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">Leaf Order</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">You transform into a plant version of yourself. You gain the plant trait and lose any trait that's inappropriate for your new form (typically humanoid). You can change from a form that looks mostly like your old self into a tree or any other non-creature plant as an action (this action has the concentrate trait). Perception checks don't reveal your true form, but a creature can attempt a Nature or Survival check against your class DC to determine that the plant is new to the surrounding area. While in this form, you can observe everything around you, but you can't act other than to spend an action (this action has the concentrate trait) to change back, which ends your turn. In this form, your AC is 30, your TAC is 20, only conditional bonuses, conditional penalties, and circumstance bonuses and penalties can affect you, and you treat all successes and critical successes on Reflex saves as failures.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Special</b> If you are a druid of the leaf order, if you transform into a non-creature plant and take your daily rest during daylight hours, the rest restores you to maximum Hit Points and removes all non-permanent drained, enfeebled, sluggish, and stupefied conditions.</p>

</blockquote>

<h3>Storm</h3>
<p>A druid of the storm carries nature's fury within her, channeling it to terrifying effect and riding the winds and storms. She is trained in Acrobatics, which is a signature skill for her. She also gains the Storm Born druid feat and the <i>tempest surge</i> order power (exclusive to that members of order). Creating unnatural weather patterns that could be damaging to the local environment (such as by using a 9th-level <i>control weather</i> ritual) is anathema to her.</p>

<p>In addition to healing magic, the primal list contains powerful energy blasts, including <i>fireball </i>and other spells newly available to druids. Armed with this magic, druids of the storm are elemental dynamos who focus on the power of the tempest, flying around in storms and ignoring penalties from weather. Notably, their <i>tempest surge </i>order power is an extremely good blast for a 1 Spell Point power, particularly after if they take a feat that ups the d10s to d12s. Let's take a look, since you'll be slinging it around a bunch of times each day.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class = "stat-block-title">Tempest Surge <span class = "stat-block-cr">Power 1</span></p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">Air</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">Electricity</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">Evocation</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Casting </b>[[A]] Somatic Casting, [[A]] Verbal Casting</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Range</b> 30 feet;<b> Targets</b> one creature</p>
<hr style = "margin: 0.5rem 0;" />
<p class = "stat-block-1">You surround a foe in a swirling storm of violent winds, roiling clouds, and crackling lightning. The storm deals 1d10 electricity damage to the target, depending on their Reflex saving throw.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Success</b> Half damage.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Critical Success</b> No damage.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Failure</b> Full damage, and the target is sluggish 1 for 1 round.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Critical Failure</b> Double damage, and the target is sluggish 2 for 1 round.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Heightened (+1)</b> The damage increases by 1d10.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>After increasing the damage to d12s, the damage scales at the same rate as <i>lightning bolt</i>. But it doesn't just deal damage! The sluggish condition penalizes AC, attack rolls, and Reflex saves, so taking double damage on the critical failure is just the beginning of the horrible pain. When we were playtesting, every creature that critically failed against <i>tempest surge </i>was in for a very bad round.</p>

<h3>Wild</h3>
<p>The savage, uncontrollable call of the natural world infuses a druid of the wild, granting her the ability to change her shape into the ferocious form of a wild creature. She is trained in Intimidation, which becomes a signature skill for her. She also gains the Wild Shape druid feat and the <i>wild claws</i> order power (exclusive to that members of order). Becoming fully domesticated by the temptations of civilization is anathema to her. (This doesn't prevent her from buying and using processed goods or staying in a city for an adventure, but she can never come to rely on these conveniences or truly call such a place her permanent home.)</p>

<p>Notice the wild order druid starts with Wild Shape? Any druid with Wild Shape feats gets a free extra casting of certain polymorph spells, heightened to her highest possible level, eventually rising up to two free castings if the druid takes enough Wild Shape feats. But the thing that makes a wild order druid particularly different is that, in addition to these, she gains a number of additional bonus castings of these spells equal to her Strength modifier (if it's more than 1). That means a druid of the wild tends towards higher Strength than a typical member of other orders.</p>

<h2>Druid Features</h2>
<p>Aside from an order, you gain spellcasting and primal spell proficiency at the same levels as all the other spellcasters, new spell levels at every odd level save 19th, expert proficiency in primal spells at 12th level, master proficiency at 16th level, and legendary proficiency at 19th level. You also get the secret Druidic language (don't teach it to nondruids&mdash;that's anathema!) and wild empathy, which lets you use Diplomacy to Make a Request of animals, and possibly of plants if you're a leaf order aficionado.</p>

<h2>Druid Feats</h2>
<p>I covered many feats that connect to orders, but many feats aren't affiliated, like this powerhouse:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class = "stat-block-title">[[F]] Leyline Conduit <span class = "stat-block-cr">Feat 20</span></p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">Druid</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">Metamagic</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Frequency</b> once per minute</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Trigger</b> You start to cast a spell of 5th level or lower that has no duration and a maximum of 2 spellcasting actions.</p>
<hr style = "margin: 0.5rem 0;" />
<p class = "stat-block-1">You add a Somatic Casting action to the casting of the triggering spell, and you don't expend the prepared spell as you cast it.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This means every minute, you can cast a 5th level or lower spell without expending it. That's really useful! There are some interesting effects of how Jason designed this feat, though, that make it more than just a simple repetition, particularly the fact that you can use Leyline Conduit only if you were already able to cast the spell, meaning you had to prepare it and then avoid using it up by casting it without Leyline Conduit. So the feat gives you somewhat limitless uses of the spell, but if you really need to cast it again before the minute is up, while Leyline Conduit is unavailable, you'll expend the spell for real (at least for the rest of the day).</p>

<h2>Animal Companions</h2>
<p>Before I go, let's talk about animal companions. While Jason was deep in preliminary design of the druid, he bestowed upon me a strange primal chart of flowing options, almost in Druidic itself, and explained it to me. This chart combined all the best aspects of the 4th- and 7th-level animal companion advancements with animal companion archetypes and new unique features for each different animal, all while moving away from having to make tons of basic feat selections for the companion. What I built from that chart was the first draft of the animal companion system in the playtest. Let's show off the companion most often overlooked in Pathfinder First Edition, the noble bear. The bear has generated a plethora of threads dedicated to how neglected it is, so let's see how the playtest handles it.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class = "stat-block-title">Bear</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">Your companion is a grizzly, panda, polar bear, or other type of bear.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Size</b> Small</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>[[A]] Unarmed</b><b>Strikes</b> jaws, <b>Damage</b> 1d8 piercing;</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">claw (agile), <b>Damage</b> 1d6 slashing</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Abilities</b> Str, Con</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Hit Points</b> 8</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Skill</b> Intimidation</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Senses</b> scent</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Speed</b> 35 feet</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Work Together Benefit</b> Your bear mauls your enemies when you create an opening. Until your next turn, all your weapon Strikes against a creature your bear threatens deal 1d8 additional slashing damage. If your bear has a specialization, the additional slashing damage increases to 2d8.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Advanced Maneuver</b> Bear Hug</p>
<p></p>
<p class = "stat-block-title">[[A]]Bear Hug</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Requirements </b>Your last action was a successful claw Strike.</p>
<hr style = "margin: 0.5rem 0;" />
<p class = "stat-block-1">Make another claw Strike against the same target. If your Strike hits, the target is also grabbed, as if you had succeeded at the Grapple action.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The bear starts out Small. Don't worry&mdash;when it grows up, it can eventually become a Large bear (in the first book, too; there's no need to wait). The bear's boost in Strength and d8 damage die for its jaws make it the most directly damaging companion, tied with the snake, which it edges out in terms of Constitution, Hit Points, and land Speed. (The snake, for its part, has better AC and lots of special Speeds.) The Work Together benefit is something you can have the bear do instead of attack, and it again deals the most direct damage, adding 1d8 (later 2d8) to the damage of your weapon Strikes. The bear is a great companion for someone who plans, much like the bear itself, to wade into the thick of the fight. Finally, the bear can eventually learn the Bear Hug advanced maneuver. This maneuver essentially means that if the bear hits twice in a row, it gets a free automatic grapple. Handy for keeping foes in place!</p>

<p>So that about wraps up the druid. If you were a druid, which of the four orders would you be?</p>

<p itemprop="description">The folks from Order of the Amber Die are back again! Get ready to dive into adventure with a new report from their latest marathon session running through <a href="/products/btpy9sk6?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-124-City-in-the-Deep"><i>Pathfinder Adventure Path #124: City in the Deep</i></a>! Be forewarned, though! There are spoilers aplenty in this report. (Maybe just look at the awesome pictures if you're playing through this.)</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Going into volume four of the Ruins of Azlant Adventure Path, we had a couple of pieces of information about what lay ahead; these included following a lead about a veiled master, and knowing that we were headed to the underwater city of Talasantri. We originally scheduled our usual four-day run, but during play we endeared ourselves to the city and adjusted our schedules to make this a slow-burning marathon of nearly a week, culminating with fireworks and food on the 4th of July!</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20180721-Lionfish1.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20180721-Lionfish1_360.jpeg"></a>

<p>To create immersion for our visit to an underwater city, we surrounded our play area with a 360-degree panorama of undersea scenes matching the coral streets of Talasantri (including a merfolk evocative of many we'd encounter). To capture the effect of jellyfish lanterns lighting the city, we employed string lights of appropriate colors, along with sparkling underwater lighting effects from our local Halloween store. As we toured establishments in the city, we were enraptured by music from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhJLO5pFKTI">Aquasonic</a>, played completely underwater. Lastly, our tabletop itself glimmered with the craftsmanship of both <a href="http://bluetablepainting.com/">Blue Table Painting</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BlackBardStudios/">Black Bard Studios</a>, who helped bring Talasantri to life for us.</p>

<li>Adventure: Pathfinder Adventure Path #124: City in the Deep</li>
<li>Marathon Length: 125 hours, 50min</li>
<li>Session Hours: 60hrs, 15min</li>
</ul>
<h2>Highlights From "City in the Deep"</h2>
  
<ul>
<li>Our biggest concern was how it was going to play out being underwater for so long. Matt, a veteran of the Order and our "Player Captain Emeritus," supervised the party's toolkit for underwater adventuring. He made it so that we were able to enjoy our time in the deep without having to stress too much about the lack of air, cold temperatures, and pressure damage. Spells like <i>endure elements</i>, <i>water breathing</i>, <i>waterproof</i>, and <i>ride the waves</i> (combined with a <i>rod of metamagic extend</i>) were easy enough to keep track of. At the same time, certain items ensured that we had backup measures: <i>pearl of the sirens</i>, <i>necklace of adaptation</i>, <i>apparatus of the crab</i>, and pressure pills (from the <a href="/products/btpy9toq?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Aquatic-Adventures"><i>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Aquatic Adventures</i></a> sourcebook.</li>
<li>Our list of friends and alliances continued to grow. Nieran Codali, a Mordant Spire elf rescued from the bottom of <a href="/products/btpy9uk2?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-123-The-Flooded-Cathedral"><i>The Flooded Cathedral</i></a>, considered it essential to accompany us after he saw that three of our four iconics were human; since, as he explained to Merisiel openly, the humans were certain to fail. Though he sometimes refers to us as "the bastards of Azlant" and talks about our humans in the third person, we wouldn't have survived the final battle without him.</li>
<li>While exploring the island of Blood Lily Cay in search of an ancient weapon, we spotted a ruined temple through the foliage. Facing its divine guardian/broken soul coatl turned into a 26-round combat worthy of any World Cup elimination match. Unfortunately, our first "own goal" of the campaign also occurred, when Kyra cast a <i>mass cure light wounds</i> in an attempt to damage the creature she assumed was undead (without successfully identifying it). Instead, she healed the coatl at a crucial moment, ensuring we'd have to retreat in defeat.</li>
<li>Some BIG creatures live under the waves, and we're starting to meet them. The best God of War boss fights couldn't hold a candle to watching Valeros go into melee alone against a gargantuan dire shark, and later a colossal shipwrecker crab. The aquanaut beat them both.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Odyssey</h2>
<p>Talasantri looked unlike anywhere we'd ever been, and yet much of the city functioned like plenty of places we had been. We shopped, got invited to parties, became caught up in local intrigues, and the relationships we built ended up being more important to our success than any treasure we found. We had to pick our friends wisely though, and there were certainly options: aristocratic merfolk, proud aquatic elves, shady cecaelias, and plenty more. Kyra's ability to hit a DC 52 Diplomacy check certainly came in useful, but most citizens were indifferent to surface folk, so Dan still had to roleplay his way into positions to use it. Ezren even fell for a merfolk who styled herself as the "Arcanic Researcher" of the city, and was invited to view her collection of rare magic items (a visit he wouldn't discuss with us). We're keeping the large map we printed of Talasantri, and we'll be going back in this campaign&mdash;or another.</p>
  
<h2>Character Deaths</h2>
<ul>
<li>Merisiel was able to corner a deep merfolk sorcerer after minutes of chasing his multiple castings of <i>dimension door</i>. Facing only the elf, the merfolk cast defensively and gambled on a <i>disintegrate</i>. From just a foot away, he reached out a finger toward the rogue&mdash;natural 20. The critical hit was almost inevitable, and Merisiel's saving throw was a tragic natural 1. So 26d6 became 52d6, and our GM wanted to roll it all at once. We scoured the house for d6s, and everyone pitched in some of their own. Total damage? 192. The single highest amount of damage ever delivered by a spell in OAD history.</li>
<li>When draugr are protecting a shrine of Dagon with <i>keen</i> greataxes, Power Attack, and times 3 critical multipliers, some PCs are going to wind up face down. Kyra took 57 points of damage in three hits, and Merisiel took 106 points of damage in two hits. At least they went out together.</li>
<li>An out-of-water excursion threw off some adventuring routines we had established, and we stumbled into two ambushes by the aptly named Blood Lilies. Koloshkora and Ezren found out through experience that the plants were highly poisonous, too.</li>
</ul>
  
<h3>Best Quote From Marathon 4</h3>
<p>(While crossing the ocean floor at 20 ft. speed.)</p>
<p><b>Valeros:</b> "Can't this thing go any faster?"</p>
<p><b>Merisiel:</b> "Not with the old man driving."</p>
<p><b>Ezren:</b> "This is maximum speed, thank you."</p>

<h2>Current Situation</h2>
<p>We've discovered that our quarry, the veiled master named Ochymua, seeks a weapon with the power to devastate Golarion. For assistance, it seems Ochymua contacted an ancient lich named Auberon the Drowned&mdash;which means now we seek this same lich. Armed with two <i>aberration bane</i> weapons and a ranger with a +6 favored enemy bonus, we're locked and loaded as we head into part five of this Adventure Path. We have three words for all alghollthu who oppose us: BRING IT ON.</p>

<div class="blurb180" style="display:none;"><a href="/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180329-Preview2.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180329-Preview2_180.jpeg"></a></div>

<p itemprop = "description"><i>Francesco <a href="/people/Doppelschwert">"Doppelschwert"</a> Silvestri tackles the latest Homebrew Special challenge with his new Pathfinder Adventure Card Gamecampaign: Emerald Legacy. He totally had me at "Sharkomancer."&mdash;Mike</i></p>

<p>Now that <a href="/products/btpy9vmz?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Ultimate-Combat-AddOn-Deck"><i>Ultimate Combat</i></a> and <i><a href="/products/btpy9x03?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Ultimate-Equipment-AddOn-Deck">Ultimate Equipment</a></i> are out, so Hayato and Reiko are available as playable characters, I'm finally ready to proudly present my latest longtime project: Emerald Legacy, a new homebrew Adventure Path for <a href="/store/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/adventures/skullAndShackles">Skull &amp; Shackles</a>!</p>

<p>Before we get into specifics, let's start with a short rundown of the setting. In the prologue, you start in Absalom and are hired as mercenaries by the Tian noble Hiro Yamashi to join his expedition to the Shackles, where his brother Masao has fled after stealing a family heirloom. In order to get the heirloom back, you'll chase Masao and his henchmen through several exotic locations, discovering his plans along the way. Once you find out what he's up to, will you be able to stop him in time? I certainly hope so!</p>

<p>When I started this project, I first looked back on all the experience I gathered while working on my first homebrew AP <a href="/community/blog/v5748dyo5lk5g?Homebrew-Special-Revenge-of-the-Wicked">Revenge of the Wicked</a>. While I'm very happy with how RotW turned out, I have to admit that setting up the box is rather complicated, so I wanted to improve on this aspect in Emerald Legacy. At the same time, I wanted to change a lot of things to give the set my own spin and try out some new ideas.</p>

<p>The one thing from RotW I was absolutely sure that I wanted to keep was the great appearance of the cards made by Ludwig Orsingher, and so I asked him to help me out with this project again. Luckily, he agreed, and he made both the awesome logo as well as the great realizations of all the custom cards for Emerald Legacy, a contribution for which I want to express my deep gratitude.</p>

<p>With that said, let's have a look at what Emerald Legacy has in store for you!</p>

<h2>Your ship is your upgradeable base of operations.</h2>
<p>I like it when RPGs give you the option to have your own upgradeable base&mdash;a place for your heroes to return to between adventures. In the RPG version of Skull &amp; Shackles, you can earn your own island; it's also a central mechanic in the popular Kingmaker AP. For Emerald Legacy, I decided early on that I wanted a base to be important both in the narrative as well as mechanically. My solution for this was to make the <i>Shirofune</i>, an upgradeable ship that grows alongside you during the course of the AP. (You might think that the concept of a floating fortress is a fantasy trope, but warships like these were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atakebune">actually used in Japan during the 16th and 17th century</a>.)</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180720-Shirofunefront.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180720-Shirofunefront_180.jpeg"></a><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/220180720-Facilities.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180720-Facilities_360.jpeg"></a><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180720-CargoTable.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180720-CargoTable_360.jpeg"></a>
<br /><i><b>Note:</b> The artwork on the Shirofune card above was done by myself, and is not covered by the <a href="/community/communityuse">Paizo Community Use Policy</a></i>.</p></div>

<p>My idea was to set up the <i>Shirofune</i> much like a character. Instead of skills, though, there are ship facilities, which produce cards from an upgrade box you can customize yourself with 3 class decks, another AP, or Skull &amp; Shackles itself. This allows you to give the set a distinct flavor by adding your favorite expansions. (The <i><a href="/products/btpy9hvy?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Monk-Class-Deck">Monk Class Deck</a></i> and the Ultimate Combat and Ultimate Equipment decks make excellent candidates for a Tian theme.) From a narrative point of view, your choice of upgrade box corresponds to the people that were hired to work on the ship.</p>

<p>And instead of a cards list, there's a list of cargo that you get to add as plunder to your ship at the beginning of each scenario! These cards can be used as an income for boons, as payment for the cards from the upgrade box, or to use the ship card's power (discussed below).</p>

<h2>You'll never walk alone.</h2>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180720-HiroYamashi.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180720-HiroYamashi_180.jpeg"></a><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180720-UmikoSensei.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180720-UmikoSensei_180.jpeg"></a><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180720-RagingWave.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180720-RagingWave_360.jpeg"></a>
<br /><i>For once, no one expects you to save the world all by yourself.</i></p></div>

<p>While your party plays an essential role in the story of Emerald Legacy, you're not the only ones working toward your goal of stopping Hiro's brother Masao. Important NPCs will regularly help you out as cohorts, and when everything else fails, you can resort to calling the Order of the Raging Wave to help you out! This seafaring monk order has travelled with Hiro from Tian Xia to support him on his quest, and their leader Umiko Sensei acts as your mentor during the journey.</p>

<p>In exchange for a little donation in the form of a plunder card, they will temporarily replace your role card, gladly taking care of your problems for you. This role card is the third step of turning your ship into a character by having its crew earn power feats. Over the course of the AP, you can have them learn all kinds of useful tricks to cover the weaknesses of your party. You could very well play through Emerald Legacy with 1d4 in Wisdom without the need to despair at the first sight of the infamous Siren Caller!</p>

<h2><b>You have rivals, and there are sidequests connected to them.</b></h2>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180720-KazetheRuthless.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180720-KazetheRuthless_180.jpeg"></a><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180720-Sidequests.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180720-Sidequests_180.jpeg"></a><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180720-ElizmaratheBrazen.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180720-ElizmaratheBrazen_180.jpeg"></a>
<br /><i>Instead of pirates vs. ninjas, it will be you vs. pirates AND ninjas!</i></p></div>

<p>For this AP, I thought it would be cool to fight against a rivaling party with opposing goals. While you are fighting on Hiro's side, his brother Masao has a band of loyal followers that you will meet several times throughout your journey. To keep them fresh and relevant, I made them veterans and introduced villain feats, which grant them additional powers over time. Since you get to choose those powers, you can start with the least disruptive powers for your party, but you will eventually be forced to make what I hope to be hard choices. Additionally, each villain has a theme that will influence the rules of the scenario they appear in. For example, there is usually a scenario rule related to examining cards when Kaze is around. By encountering these villains several times, it was possible to flesh them out more, and I didn't need to make a huge number of custom cards you would use just once.</p>

<p>In Emerald Legacy, sidequests are the only way to earn loot cards, and they have minor and major consequences for later parts of the AP and the ending of the story! I've introduced 2 sidequests for each villain, giving you even more opportunities to interact with them.</p>

<h2>You'll get into all kind of crazy situations.</h2>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180720-ShrineofSealing.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180720-ShrineofSealing_180.jpeg"></a><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180720-OgreMage.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180720-OgreMage_180.jpeg"></a><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180720Hirgenzosk.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180720Hirgenzosk_180.jpeg"></a>
<br /><i><b>Note:</b> The artwork on the Shrine of Sealing card above was done by myself, and is not covered by the <a href="/community/communityuse">Paizo Community Use Policy</a>.</i></p></div>

<p>I'll openly admit that when I make my homebrew adventure paths, I often try to incorporate my favorite mechanics from the official material, which you can consider as my love letter to the game. In particular, Mummy's Mask had a big influence on many of Emerald Legacy's cards and scenarios.</p>


<div class = "blurb360"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180720-Shen.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180720-Shen_360.jpeg"></a>
<br /><i>Illustration by Ben Wootten</i>.</p></div>

<p>However, I also try to come up with new mechanics and ways to make the game feel different from what you are used to. Emerald Legacy contains a new type of scenario that I like to think of as "Showdown Scenarios." These all use the Shrine of Sealing, a location where characters are not allowed to start. No matter what you do, the villains will eventually all end up in the Shrine of Sealing, and you need to close all other locations before you can win. Assuming you win the fight against a villain, it's actually better not to temporarily close any locations in these scenarios, which has a major impact on how you can approach them.</p>

<p>Here's a short list of my favorite 5 features from other Emerald Legacy scenarios, in no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a self-proclaimed "sharkomancer" that lets you roll on a shark table.</li>
<li>You can reunite a dinosaur with its lost baby (or keep it for yourself&mdash;I'm not judging).</li>
<li>There is an anti-magic zone that your casters won't like very much.</li>
<li>You can encounter a tribe of grindylows living inside of Hirgenzosk.</li>
<li>Depending on how you play, you may or may not encounter the guy to the right.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to try out Emerald Legacy, you can find the free PDF and further information in <a href="/threads/rzs2v7wk?Emerald-Legacy-Adventure-Path">this thread</a>. I'm still updating the PDF as well, so any feedback is welcome!</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy the AP and can use it to scratch your Tian Xia itch until the day we can have an official card game version of Jade Regent :) Until next time!</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline">Running the Game</h1>
<p class="date">Friday, July 20, 2018</p>

<div itemprop="articleBody">

<div class="blurbCenter" style="display: none;"><a href="/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PathfinderPlaytest-BlogPreview.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PathfinderPlaytest-BlogPreview_360.jpeg"></a></div>

<p itemprop="description">As the Pathfinder Playtest begins, Game Masters will need to quickly get up to speed with the new rules. The Game Mastering chapter of the <a href="/products/btpya0ae?Pathfinder-Playtest-Rulebook-Hardcover"><i>Pathfinder Playtest Rulebook</i></a> is here to help you out! It covers the responsibilities of a GM, gives advice on running sessions, and teaches you how to adjudicate the rules of the game. Because this is a playtest, there aren't details about creating your own campaign or adventures, but rest assured, this information will appear in the Pathfinder Second Edition rulebook!</p>

<h2>Running Modes of Play</h2>
<p>A large section of the Game Mastering chapter runs through the special concerns of running the three modes of play: encounters, exploration, and downtime. The specific rules governing those modes appear in the Playing the Game chapter, so this chapter instead talks about how to set the pace of the game as you GM. Exploration and downtime get the most focus here, since most the rules for running encounters are addressed in Playing the Game. The section on exploration goes over exploration tactics characters might adopt, and gives advice on what to do when players want to choose tactics that aren't included in the default options. It also addresses how to begin and end encounters, including some advice on how to use the new initiative rules of the playtest. The section on downtime shows you how to play out a single downtime day at the table, and how to cover long periods of downtime quickly and keep them interesting. It also talks about buying and selling items and retraining abilities.</p>

<h2>Difficulty Classes</h2>
<p>Setting DCs is one of your major tasks as GM, and the rulebook covers how to create two different types of DCs: those that are appropriate for a certain level and those that are static challenges in the world. This first category is great when you need the DC of an obstacle created by an enemy of a certain level but don't have all their statistics, when you set the DC to Craft an item of a particular level, and so on. Levels and categories of difficulty are given in a table so you can pick a DC quickly. The level is based on your opposition's level, and the category depends on the particular situation. Here's a portion of that table.</p>

<div class = "callout-block indent" style = "width: 350px;">
<table class = "table-spacing-large">
<thead><tr><th><b>Level</b></th><th><b>Trivial</b></th><th><b>Low</b></th><th><b>High</b></th><th><b>Severe</b></th><th><b>Extreme</b></th></thead><tbody><tr><td>0</td><td> 9</td><td>10</td><td>12</td><td>14</td><td>17</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>10</td><td>12</td><td>14</td><td>15</td><td>18</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>11</td><td>13</td><td>15</td><td>16</td><td>19</td></tr></tbody></table></div>

<p>Static challenges are everything from climbing a tree to identifying a minor noble. These tasks don't really get more difficult if the PCs are higher level, but can still be expressed in terms of level and difficulty category. The guidelines explain how to select a level and category of difficulty. For instance, climbing a rope that's hanging in mid-air is a level 1 task, so it's normally a high DC (14), but it might have a low DC (12) if you can brace yourself against a wall while climbing through a narrow area, and maybe even a trivial DC (10) if you can brace against two walls. Because static DCs don't increase as the PCs advance in levels, eventually low-level static tasks will become nearly automatic for them. We give guidelines here for GMs crafting their own adventures, but it's ultimately up to them what level and DC tasks are. (In published adventures, this information is still provided.)</p>

<p>As you can see, the rules for DCs intentionally put far more choice in your hands as the GM. Rather than having a long list of DCs and modifiers pre-defined, we wanted to let the GM assess the particulars of any given situation and then use some simple tools to set the DC, rather than needing to calculate a DC based on rules that aren't always exactly suitable to the challenge facing the players.</p>

<p>This section also speaks to some particular categories of skill DCs for crafting, gathering Information, performing for an audience, practicing a trade with Lore, recalling knowledge with skills like Arcana or Lore, or training an animal.</p>

<h2>Rewards</h2>
<p>This section contains some rules not directly related to <i>Doomsday Dawn</i>, but that we want people to take a look at and use if they create their own campaigns during the playtest. One thing that shows up is rules on awarding Experience Points. This includes XP awards for accomplishments, so that you'll have guidance for when the group pulls off important tasks that aren't encounters or hazards. As noted previously, it normally takes 1,000 XP to level up, but there are also options for varying the players' advancement speed by having a new level every 800 XP or 1,200 XP. If you're playtesting your own campaign, you might want to have characters level up every 800 XP so you get a chance to playtest more levels of the game!</p>

<h2>Environment and Hazards</h2>
<p>The last section of the Game Mastering chapter briefly summarizes environments and the rules for hazards (such as traps, environmental dangers, and haunts). These are covered in more detail in the <i>Pathfinder Playtest Bestiary</i>. They'll be in the final version of Pathfinder Second Edition's core rulebook, but the <i>Playtest Rulebook</i> didn't have quite enough space for the whole thing!</p>

<p>Are you looking forward to GMing playtest games? What changes are you hoping to see? Are you going to run <i>Doomsday Dawn</i>, or try some of your own adventures too? Sound off in the comments!</p>

<p itemprop="description">Attendees of PaizoCon 2018 might have noticed something new and unusual in the program booklet: a page with a map of Varisia overlaid with a grid, accompanied by a challenge to seek out a packet of puzzles and solve the mystery of the <i>virtuous sihedron</i>.</p>


<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20180719-PuzzleHuntMap.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20180719-PuzzleHuntMap_360.jpeg"></a></div>

<p>Why, that was just the annual PaizoCon Puzzle Hunt coming back strong! We debuted this event last year, and it went over so well, we were able to increase its exposure and present an even more exciting and involved set of puzzles. But we know not everyone can make it to the convention, so we are proud to present the entire thing here for you! Check the link below, which contains everything you need to participate in this year's puzzle hunt... except, of course, your wits. Unfortunately, we can't offer any prizes for completing this puzzle hunt (or for discovering the secret secondary puzzle that hides within), but rest assured we will be back in 2019 with another set, as well as some new partners in this endeavor!</p>

<p style = "text-align: center; font-weight: bold;"><a href = "/include/PaizoCon2018PuzzleHunt.zip">Download the PaizoCon 2018 Puzzle Hunt!</a> &mdash; <span class = "tiny">3.1 MB zip/PDF</span></p>

<h2>What is a puzzle hunt?</h2>
<p>A puzzle hunt is a series of linked puzzles, with the answer to each being a word or phrase. Those words and phrases are used in the puzzle on the first page of the PDF to generate the hunt's final solution. Figuring out how that puzzle works is part of the challenge!</p>

<h2>Who made this, anyway?</h2>
<p>Once again, that's us! We challenged ourselves from last year to add more visual elements to these new puzzles, creating what we hope are a diverse array of interesting mind-bending enigmas. But we couldn't have done it without the aid of Art Director Sonja Morris, who created all of the puzzle hunt's outstanding graphics!</p>

<h2>What do I do if get stuck?</h2>
<p>First, put the puzzle down and come back at it in an hour or so with a fresh mind. Perhaps you'll spot something you hadn't seen before. Be sure to reread the instructions at the top of the page; sometimes clues are hidden in there! If all that fails, feel free to ask for a hint on the Paizo.com forums. There's no shame in getting a nudge from a fellow solver, and perhaps you can help her in return with a different puzzle!</p>

<p itemprop="description">There's a lot to talk about this blog, so we're just going to jump right into the exciting set of releases coming out in just a few weeks.</p>

<p><a href="/products/btpya0a2?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-1-18-The-Blackmoon-Survey"><i>Starfinder Society Scenario #1-18: The Blackmoon Survey</i></a>, by Paizo veteran Jesse Benner, showcases the Starfinder Society's first foray to the undead world of Eox. When Starfinder agents and undead workers start disappearing from a Starfinder-operated excavation site near the infamous Blackmoon mountain, it's up to the PCs to make the trip to Eox and uncover what's happening. This Tier 1-4 scenario involves heavy investigation along with some interesting encounter set-ups that the Organized Play team is very curious to hear reactions about.</p>

<p><i>This scenario has no special scenario tags.</i></p>

<div class = "blurb180"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/StarfinderSociety/20180718-Zafeldrin.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/StarfinderSociety/20180718-Zafeldrin_120.jpeg"></a>
<br /><i>Illustration by Graey Erb</i></p></div>

<p>The second July scenario is our second venture into the (currently) lofty heights of Tier 5-8. You might recognize Matt Duval's name from several prominent Pathfinder Society Scenarios, and he did an excellent job putting together <a href="/products/btpya0a3?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-119-To-Conquer-the-Dragon"><i>Starfinder Society Scenario #1-19: To Conquer the Dragon</i></a>[/url]. Sometimes, I tend to obfuscate what happens during the course of a scenario, but I think that this particular entry might be just a little bit self-explanatory. I mean, sometimes the PCs just need to punch a dragon in its smug face. Also, there's some extra special bonus lore points for PCs who come into this scenario having played <a href="/products/btpy9zjw?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-1-13-On-the-Trail-of-History"><i>Starfinder Society Scenario #1-13: On the Trail of History</i></a>.</p>

<p><i>This scenario has the starship tag.</i></p>

<div class = "blurb180"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/StarfinderSociety/20180718-Sparklemane.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/StarfinderSociety/20180718-Sparklemane_120.jpeg"></a>
<br /><i>Illustration by Graey Erb</i></p></div>

<p>Our next Gen Con release (technically an August release, but who's counting?) is a return to a fan favorite. <a href="/products/btpya0dv?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-1-20-Duskmire-Accord-9"><i>Starfinder Society Scenario #1-20: Duskmire Accord 9</i></a> is a pretty unique Tier 1-4 scenario that resumes the Society's ongoing exploration of the megacomplex known as Salvation's End. The scenario's author, Brian Duckwitz, maintained the ongoing momentum that the campaign has had with its exploration of Salvation's End. I don't want to say too much about this scenario, but I think it's ok to just let the art speak for itself.</p>

<p><i>This scenario has no special scenario tags.</i></p>

<div class = "blurb180"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/StarfinderSociety/20180718-Nighthopper.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/StarfinderSociety/20180718-Nighthopper_120.jpeg"></a>
<br /><i>Illustration by Nicolas Espinoza</i></p></div>

<p>Finally, Gen Con has us return to a world we haven't set foot on since last year: the ghibrani homeworld of Elytrio. Written by Paizo's own, Jason Keeley, <a href="/products/btpya0dw?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-1-21-Yesteryears-Sorrow"><i>Starfinder Society Scenario #1-21: Yesteryear's Sorrow</i></a> directly follows up on events from <a href="/products/btpy9tt0?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-103-Yesteryears-Truth"><i>Starfinder Society Scenario #1-03: Yesteryear's Truth</i></a>. The results from countless tables were tabulated to decide the future of the ghibrani people, and that future gets a bit of a push in this scenario&hellip; along with a heavy look into the past of what has become a fan-favorite species in Starfinder! Be aware that playing the previous scenario is not required, and in fact, this scenario was intentionally written so it could be equally enjoyed by characters who haven't previously interacted or learned about the ghibranis.</p>

<p><i>This scenario has the Faction (Exo-Guardians) tag.</i></p>

<p>That's it for our new releases at Gen Con 2018! This covers both the July and August releases for the Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild, but rest assured that the team is hard at work on future scenarios. As for now, I'm going to get back to working on sanctioning the upcoming <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpya1rr?Starfinder-Armory"><i>Starfinder Armory</i></a> and <a href="/products/btpya1rp?Starfinder-Adventure-Path-The-Reach-of-Empire">the first installment</a> of our upcoming Against the Aeon Throne adventure path. No rest for the wicked it seems&hellip;</p>

<p>Until next time,</p>

  <p itemprop="description">Every year, the number of scenarios released for Gen Con is huge, especially since it typically combines all the scenarios for July and August at once.

<p itemprop="description">Every year, the number of scenarios released for Gen Con is huge, especially since it typically combines all the scenarios for July and August at once. This year's been an exception insomuch as the number of scenarios is positively immense with 15 different adventures across four different campaigns: 6 <a href="/pathfindersociety/rpg">Pathfinder Society</a> scenarios, 4 <a href="/pathfindersociety/rpg">Starfinder Society</a> scenarios, 3 <a href="/store/pathfinder/pathfinderSociety/pfsrpg/scenarios/pathfinderPlaytest">Pathfinder Society Playtest</a> scenarios, and 2 <a href="/pathfindersociety/acg">Pathfinder Adventure Card Guild</a> adventures! It's so much that we're breaking our preview blogs into three different posts.</p>

<p>Thankfully, preparing so many adventures has been much more approachable thanks to our growing organized play staff. To reflect this, I've asked each scenario's respective developer to chime in with their own perspective on these excellent adventures.</p>

<p>Speaking of scenarios, by now Gen Con GMs should have received many of these in their downloads already. As of the time I'm writing this, we've completed all of our work on #9-24, #9-25, #10-01, #1-18, #1-19, Playtest #2, Playtest #3, and (just now) #10-00. Many of these have already been arriving in GM downloads, and most of the other adventures are just going through final checks over the next day or two. That means that anything you don't have yet should be arriving soon. Keep in mind that when we cued Gen Con GMs to receive these scenarios, you would have received a notice that you have them in your downloads; this is a placeholder file that's replaced with the actual file once they're on the website. We're regularly running the report to grant new scenarios as they're finalized.</p>

<p>With that, let's get a preview of the Pathfinder Society adventures coming up.</p>

<div class = "blurb360"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderSociety/20180718-Falehetu.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderSociety/20180718-Falehetu_180.jpeg"></a></div>

<p><b>Michael Sayre (organized play developer):</b> I enjoyed a journey across Golarion as I developed scenarios that took me from the ocean depths, to the savannas of the Mwangi Expanse, all the way to the Crown of the World, so I'll jump right in to sharing some of that journey with you!</p>

<p>The first scenario I'll be discussing is the Tier 5-9 adventure <a href="/products/btpya18h?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-924-Beneath-Unbroken-Waves"><i>Pathfinder Society Scenario #9-24: Beneath Unbroken Waves</i></a> from Kate Baker&mdash;who also wrote <a href="/products/btpy9x0y?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-108-Sanctuary-of-Drowned-Delight"><i>Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild Scenario #1-08: Sanctuary of Drowned Delight</i></a>. <i>Beneath Unbroken </i>Waves takes the PCs to the islands and waters off the coast of Jalmeray, where the Pathfinders meet a group of undines who have discovered the ruins of a monastery containing martial arts techniques lost to Golarion&hellip;until now! It's not all fun and games in this coastal setting though, as the PCs will also encounter deadly threats like this individual illustrated by Maja Djeke!</p>

<div class = "blurb360"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderSociety/20180718-Muhlia.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderSociety/20180718-Muhlia_180.jpeg"></a></div>

<p><b>John Compton (Organized Play Lead Developer):</b> Ever since Season 7, the organized play team's been including more seeker-level (i.e. level 12+) content in the campaign, which is a delight because it opens up a whole new caliber of narrative. A year ago, the <a href="/products/btpy9tld?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-900-Assault-on-Absalom">Pathfinder Society helped thwart</a> the so-called Fiendflesh Siege that threatened Absalom. In doing so, we learned that several of the Society's old foes had teamed up to coordinate the siege, and the Pathfinders have taken it upon themselves to personally track down these villains. Agents realized their first victories in Qadira in this season's <a href="/store/pathfinder/pathfinderSociety/pfsacg/season4">Adventure Card Guild scenarios</a>, and we've now cornered two of the masterminds in the Five Kings Mountains. There they've taken over an ossuary sacred to Magrim&mdash;dwarven god of the afterlife also featured in the upcoming <a href="/products/btpya17f?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Faiths-of-Golarion"><i>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Faiths of Golarion</i></a>&mdash;and established such potent defenses that only an elite team of Pathfinders stand any chance. <a href="/products/btpya18i?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-925-Betrayal-in-the-Bones"><i>Pathfinder Society Scenario #9-25: Betrayal in the Bones</i></a> is a Tier 12-;15 scenario that concludes Season 9 on a high note. Not only has the author Tom Phillips brought his storytelling flair and devious encounter design to bear, but the scenario also answers numerous questions that we've been waiting to reveal since as early as Season 2. How did an ex-venture-captain use that fateful wish? Why did a particular faction leader take the actions she did? And how will it all end in these final confrontations?</p>

<div class = "blurb360"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderSociety/20180718-RubyPhoenix.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderSociety/20180718-RubyPhoenix_180.jpeg"></a></div>

<p><b>Linda Zayas-Palmer (organized play developer)</b>: The Year of the Ten kicks off with a multitable interactive special for both the Roleplaying Guild and the Adventure Card Guild: <i>#10-00: The Hao Jin Cataclysm</i> (links here for the <a href="/products/btpya1xz?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-1000-The-Hao-Jin-Cataclysm">Roleplaying Guild</a> and <a href="/products/btpya1zl?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Guild-Adventure-1000-The-Hao-Jin-Cataclysm">Adventure Card Guild</a> versions). Long ago, the legendary sorcerer Hao Jin built a demiplane by tearing locations and peoples out of Golarion and stitching them together into an eclectic realm, bound together by the strength of her magic. The Pathfinder Society has made numerous excursions into this Hao Jin Tapestry demiplane over the years, cataloguing sites of forgotten history and forging alliances with isolated cultures. However, the demiplane is now in critical condition. Unless the Pathfinder Society acts quickly, the plane's very fabric will rip apart. It won't be an easy fix, however. The Society's allies on the Hao Jin Tapestry are in peril, as malevolent forces prey upon the chaos and actively accelerate the destruction. Even the tapestry's own repair mechanisms have malfunctioned horribly and now terrorize its inhabitants. Will you help save the demiplane from certain destruction? Mike Kimmel is the author for the RPG portion of this adventure, and Ron Lundeen wrote the ACG portion. If you want to discover the role this magnificent phoenix (illustrated by Marko Horvatin) has to play in the adventure, come join us at Gen Con or another convention near you.</p>

<div class = "blurb360"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderSociety/20180718-Bosk.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderSociety/20180718-Bosk_180.jpeg"></a></div>

<p><b>Linda:</b> Author Nicholas Wasko brings us the first Tier 1-5 of the season, <a href="/products/btpya1y0?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-1001-Oathbreakers-Die"><i>Pathfinder Society Scenario #10-01: Oathbreakers Die</i></a>. In most places, guilds that trade in death would have to operate undercover. In the setting for this scenario, Daggermark, the Assassins Guild and the Poisoner's Guild are effectively part of the government. Here, a Pathfinder agent who knows too much has been marked for death. The local Venture-Captain Istivil Bosk, illustrated below by Tom Ventre, has concocted a daring plot to save his life. Is your PC brave and skilled enough to save an ally without falling prey to an assassin's blade?</p>

<div class = "blurb360"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderSociety/20180718-SheWhoDevours.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderSociety/20180718-SheWhoDevours_180.jpeg"></a></div>

<p><b>Michael:</b> Moving on to our Tier 3-7 offering forces us to ask the question: "Do ants have bones in Golarion, or do the bones just belong to the ants?" <a href="/products/btpya1y1?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-1002-Bones-of-Biting-Ants"><i>Pathfinder Society Scenario #10-02: Bones of Biting Ants</i></a>, by Sean McGowan, takes place in the savannas of the Mwangi Expanse, where the PCs have been summoned to assist the lone survivor of a past Pathfinder expedition. Daring the many dangers of the sweltering savannas, the PCs must help Ulfen skald Stuinvolk Hundrakson reclaim not just the lost relics of his previous expedition, but also a piece of himself that never escaped the deaths of his allies. Bad memories and Mzali border-guards won't be the fearsome threats the party faces though, as this fearsome foe illustrated by Akim Kaliberda shows!</p>

<div class = "blurb360"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderSociety/20180718-Svala.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderSociety/20180718-Svala_180.jpeg"></a></div>

<p><b>Michael:</b> The final stop in my personal tour around Golarion takes us far away from warm coastal waters and sultry savannas, to a markedly different setting. <a href="/products/btpya1y2?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-1003-Death-On-The-Ice"><i>Pathfinder Society Scenario #10-03: Death On The Ice</i></a>, by Scott D. Young, sees Venture-Captain Bjersig Torrsen sending the PCs on a chilling trek north to the Crown of the World, where a Pathfinder expeditionhas uncovered more than they bargained for beneath the polar ice. The PCs won't be alone on their dangerous journey though, as the snowy owl Kuokei leads the party ever-northward towards his master, the ranger and archaeologist Svala Ice-Rider. Svala's Varki ancestry gave her the insight to begin unraveling an ancient riddle from the Pathfinder archives, but will the PCs find the last piece of the puzzle in time to rescue Svala from a frigid fate? I hope so, because if not, this might be the only time you get to see Svala's illustration from artist Benjamin Widdowson!</p>

<p>Join us next week for a look at our upcoming Pathfinder Society Playtest scenarios!</p>

<div itemprop="articleBody">

<p itemprop="description">Powered armor&mdash;high-tech defensive suits that move under their own power rather than using the muscles of the wearer&mdash;have a long history in science-fantasy stories, dating all the way back to E.E. "Doc" Smith's 1937 Lensman novel <i>Galactic Patrol </i>(one reason the Lensman books appear in the <a href="/products/btpy9qy1"><em>Starfinder Core Rulebook's</em></a> Inspirational Media list).

There are five suits of powered armor in the Core Rulebook, which is just enough to give an idea of how such gear works in the game, but certainly isn't anywhere near enough to cover all your possible powered armor needs.</p>

<p>Happily, there's a good deal more in <a href="/products/btpya1rr?Starfinder-Armory"><em>Starfinder Armory</em></a>.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/20180717-PowerArmorSpread.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/20180717-PowerArmorSpread_500.jpeg"></a>
<br /><i>Illustrations by Leonardo Borazio</i></p></div>

<p>The book includes 18 total suits, from the scrapper's rig (item level 4) to the starguard (item level 20), with at least one at each item level and two at item level 17). Six of those suits are Medium, eleven are Large, and one is Gargantuan. While most of them are technological items five (<i>celerity rigging</i>, <i>extradimensional armor</i>, <i>kyton bloodsuit</i>, <i>spellcaster's aegis</i>, and <i>stag-step suit</i>) incorporate magic into their core design and are hybrid items.</p>

<p>In addition to providing more than three times the number of suits as the <i>Core Rulebook</i>, Armory provides some general power armor rules, covering weapon slots, hybrid powered armor&hellip; and how to improve a suit of powered armor to be a higher item level. This system allows a character to spend credits to boot a suit of powered armor's item level, EAC and KAC bonuses, and even (if you boost it by enough item levels) its maximum Dexterity, Strength bonus, and number of upgrade slots. These improvement rules are designed to allow a player who builds a character around a specific design of powered armor, they don't have to take a suit of a different size or environmental movement or operational range just to keep their armor relevant when gaining character levels.</p>

<p>In addition to just offering more suits at more item levels, Armory also provide powered armors design for specific situations. The explorer's cradle is design for days-long missions of investigation in harsh environments. The personal submersible operates underwater, and allows you to breath water and survive great depths even without using its environmental protections. The reactor guard similar protects you from radiation, even when its environmental protections aren't active. The <i>spellcaster's aegis</i> is specifically designed to allow magic-savvy characters to manipulate its built-in runes for more effective dispel efforts and greater protection against spells.</p>

<p>Whether you are an armor storm soldier looking for a suit to improve with you as you gain levels, or a mystic who has decided the best offense is a good defense, <i>Starfinder Armory</i> has the powered armor to meet your needs!</p>

<p itemprop="description">The bard&mdash;it's arguably the most iconic support character. For some reason, bards are often the butt of goofy jokes, even though they're powerful force multipliers who can contribute to just about every aspect of play. Bard is one of my favorite classes in Pathfinder, and it has some of the most exciting changes of any of the classes in the Pathfinder Playtest, but I'm going to start you with a big one first. Are you sitting down yet? OK, good:</p>

<p>Bards are full 10-level spellcasters.</p>

<h2>Spellcasting</h2>

<p>As before, bards are spontaneous spellcasters who make up for having not quite as many spells as the other spontaneous caster, the sorcerer, by having special bardic performances. But this time around, bards don't have a delayed spellcasting progression. Instead, they have one fewer spell in their repertoire and one fewer spell slot per day at each spell level, compared to the sorcerer. That's pretty awesome already, but here's the even cooler part: bards have collected all sorts of esoteric bardic knowledge since forever, right? With an offbeat spell list that combines mental magic, a handful of unique additions, and a little bit of healing, bards are the primary occult spellcasters, blending mental and spiritual essences. That brings bards, whose spell list has grown with far less than that of wizards, to the forefront among the other primary spellcasters. This has given us the opportunity to create a bunch of cool never-before-seen bard spells for the playtest. Also, as I mentioned in the <a href = "/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkpv?All-About-Spells">spells blog</a>, bards can replace the Somatic Casting and Verbal Casting components of spellcasting by playing a musical instrument, in case you want a bard who plays the violin to cast his spells! But what about their performances? How do those come into play?</p>

<h2>Compositions</h2>
<p>Compositions are a special type of spell that only bards gain. You might be thinking these are probably powers like other classes, right? Not so! In exchange for their slightly lower number of spells bards get, most of their compositions are cantrips, usable at will, meaning you no longer need to worry about running out of bardic performance rounds per day. Not only that, they're often cast with a single action. They start out with a composition that will likely look familiar.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class = "stat-block-title">Inspire Courage <span class = "stat-block-cr">Cantrip</span></p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">Cantrip, Composition, Emotion, Enchantment, Mental<br />
<b>Casting</b> [[A]] Verbal Casting<br />
<b>Area</b> 60-foot aura<br />
<b>Duration</b> 1 round</p>
<p class = "stat-block">You inspire your allies with words or tunes of encouragement. You and all allies in the aura gain a +1 conditional bonus to attack rolls, damage rolls, and saves against fear.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Usually, a bard can cast only one composition per turn and have only one active at a time.</p>

<p>Bards have powers and Spell Points in addition to their compositions. Many bard powers allow you to manipulate and customize your performances as you desire, including increasing the duration, granting a more significant bonus (an extremely powerful benefit), or having multiple compositions active at a time. Typically, these extra benefits require a successful Performance check to activate and provide an even more powerful effect on a critical success. Take for example, lingering composition.</p>

<div class = "blurb360"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20180716-Lem.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20180716-Lem_360.jpeg"></a>
<p><i>Illustration by Wayne Reynolds</i></p></div>

<blockquote>
<p class = "stat-block-title">Lingering Composition <span class = "stat-block-cr">Power 1</span></p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">Enchantment, Power<br />
<b>Casting</b> [[F]] Verbal Casting; <b>Trigger</b> You finish casting a cantrip composition with a duration of 1 round.</p>
<p class = "stat-block">You attempt to add a flourish to your composition to extend its benefits. Attempt a Performance check. The DC is usually a high-difficulty DC of a level equal to the highest-level target of your composition, but the GM can assign a different DC based on the circumstances. The effect depends on the result of your check.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Success</b> The composition lasts 2 rounds.<br />
<b>Critical Success</b> The composition lasts 3 rounds.<br />
<b>Failure</b> The composition lasts 1 round.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But altering your performances with special modifications like this is just one of several paths represented by a new bardic class feature…</p>

<h2>Muses</h2>
<p>A bard's inspiration comes from a unique place&mdash;his muse. There are three muses in the Pathfinder Playtest.  The first is maestro, focused on powers that alter compositions. Next is lore, focused on Occultism, willpower, and unusual knowledge. The third is polymath, focused on being a jack of all trades with increased skills and ability to handle unexpected situations, including the ability to keep a spellbook to prepare a small number of new spells to add to your repertoire each day. As befits the individualistic nature of a performer's muse, none of the initial muse abilities are exclusive, so you can use your feats to traverse as deeply as you want into the abilities from each path; your muse merely represents a starting point on your bardic journey.</p>

<p>For example, if you select the maestro muse at 1st level, you gain the Lingering Composition bard feat (granting you the lingering composition power detailed above) and add soothe to your spell repertoire, but any bard can take this feat or learn this spell&mdash;selecting the maestro muse just grants them as a default.</p>

<h2>Bard Features</h2>
<p>As a bard, you gain spellcasting and occult spell proficiency at the same levels as the other spellcasters, new spell levels at every odd level except 19, expert proficiency in occult spells at 12th level, master proficiency at 16th level, and legendary proficiency at 19th level. You also have the most trained skills at 1st level except for rogues, just barely edging out rangers. Finally, you begin play at 1st level with two compositions, the inspire courage cantrip (which has been detailed above) and the counter performance power.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class = "stat-block-title">Counter Performance <span class = "stat-block-cr">Power 1</span></p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">Composition, Enchantment, Fortune, Mental, Power<br />
<b>Casting</b> [[R]] Verbal Casting or [[R]] Somatic Casting; <b>Trigger</b> You or an ally within 60 feet must roll a saving throw against an auditory or visual effect.<br />
<b>Area</b> 60-foot aura</p>
<p class = "stat-block">You protect yourself and allies through performance. Choose an auditory performance if the trigger was auditory or a visual performance if it was visual, then roll a Performance check for the chosen performance. You and allies in the area can use the higher result of your Performance check or their saving throws.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since you need to use only a reaction to cast counter performance, rather than needing to activate it ahead of time like in Pathfinder First Edition, creatures that rely on visual or auditory effects will have a really hard time messing with you!</p>

<h2>Bard Feats</h2>
<p>Bard feats tend to fall in two categories: feats associated that are loosely associated with one of the three muses, and those that grant you a new composition.</p>

<p>For instance, the Cantrip Expansion feat at 4th level allows you to add two cantrips from the occult spell list to your spell repertoire, which can come in handy for those bards with the lore or the polymath muses. The powerful 14th-level Allegro feat, on the other hand, grants you the following cantrip to add a spring to an ally's step.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class = "stat-block-title">Allegro <span class = "stat-block-cr">Cantrip</span></p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">Cantrip, Composition, Emotion, Enchantment, Mental<br />
<b>Casting</b> [[A]] Verbal Casting<br />
<b>Range</b> 30 feet; <b>Targets</b> one ally<br />
<b>Duration</b> 1 round</p>
<p class = "stat-block">You perform rapidly, speeding your ally. The ally is quick and can use the action to Strike, Stride, or Step.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There's plenty of favorites in there from among bardic masterpieces from Ultimate Magic too, like house of imaginary walls, which Cosmo used with his goblin bard to mime a box around my ranger, trapping me with a dangerous enemy while Cosmo remained safe and sound.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, bards now have a vast number of quality-of-life improvements, while fundamentally staying true to the way they worked before. Fellow bard fans, what do you think?</p>

<p class="date">Friday, July 13, 2018</p>

<div itemprop="articleBody">

<div class="blurbCenter" style="display: none;"><a href="/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20180430-Preview.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20180430-Preview_360.jpeg"></a></div>

<p itemprop="description">When it comes to using game rules to simulate a fantasy setting, one thing that's always been in the background in Pathfinder has been the idea that certain monsters, types of armor, and so on are more common in some areas than in others. For instance, Pathfinder First Edition's rules for the Knowledge skill rely on the fact that some monsters are more commonly known, though it doesn't really define which are which. Meanwhile, there are circumstances such as the spell <i>Echean's excellent enclosure </i>from <i>Rival Guide </i>where knowledge of a spell is closely guarded by its creator (in this case, an evil 20th-level wizard).</p>

<p>To make it easier for players and GMs to engage in worldbuilding, whether playing in Golarion or your own setting, we've created a formalized framework for the Pathfinder Playtest&mdash;using the categories common, uncommon, rare, and unique&mdash;that you can use to help determine the tone of a setting, region, or adventure. These are relative terms; while we list suggested rarities for various rules elements, they naturally vary from place to place even within the same campaign setting. For instance, in the playtest, a longsword is listed as common, and a katana is listed as uncommon, but in a game focused around Japanese fantasy (or, in Golarion, Minkai or Minkai-influenced nations in Tian Xia), a katana would be common and a longsword might be uncommon.</p>

<h2>Common</h2>
<p>Something is common if it's ubiquitous in its category, like any of the core races and core classes, longswords, <i>fireball</i>, <i>bracers of armor</i>, and the like. All characters can select common options without restriction.</p>

<h2>Uncommon</h2>
<p>Something is uncommon if it's a little rarer, but still possible to find or use if you are deeply interested in it. These options are a bit weirder, more complicated, or known to fewer people, so they haven't spread across the world as much. Many uncommon options explicitly become available to a character as they proceed along a path that teaches them about that option. For instance, all domain powers in the playtest are uncommon spells, but clerics are granted access to domain powers through their deities. Characters from a given region, ethnicity, religion, or other group in your world might gain access to uncommon options associated with it. To go back to our previous example, even in a game set in the Inner Sea region of Golarion, if your character hailed from Minkai in her background, you and the GM might decide that you should gain access to Eastern weapons instead of, or in addition to, Western ones.</p>

<p>Story events in your game are another way a character could gain access to uncommon options. For instance, Stephen previously mentioned in the <a href="/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkq6?Secrets-of-Alchemy">blog on alchemical items</a> that you would have to get the formula for drow sleep poison from the drow; it's an uncommon option. But in your campaign, if your alchemist was captured by the drow and forced to brew poisons for them, the GM might add drow sleep poison and other uncommon options to the formulas available to your alchemist! Uncommon options make amazing rewards to find in adventures, and they can be found at a much higher rate than rare options, since they are more common in the world.</p>

<h2>Rare</h2>
<p>Something is rare if it's extremely difficult to obtain without doing something special in-world to find it. This means that rare options involve interplay between the player and the GM, or are granted by the GM directly. There's no way to get access to these through choices in your character build alone. Rare options are spells known only to the ancient runelords, techniques passed down by the grandmaster of an ancient monastery in the Wall of Heaven mountains, golem-crafting secrets of the Jistka Imperium, and the like.</p>

<h2>Unique</h2>
<p>Something is unique if there's only one. Most artifacts are unique, as are certain monsters, like the Sandpoint Devil or Grendel. No artifacts appear in the <i>Playtest Rulebook</i>, so in the playtest only a few <em>Doomsday Dawn</em> monsters and hazards are unique.</p>

<h1>Uses of Rarity</h1>
<p>So how is this system useful to you?</p>

<h2>Worldbuilding and Emulating Genres</h2>
<p>First of all, your group can really alter the flavor and feel of the game by changing around the commonness of certain elements, allowing for a wide variety of genre play and settings through a relatively simple system. This is a big tool in your toolkit for worldbuilding. What would a world be like where the wizard was uncommon, or where all healing magic was rare? You can create a new subgenre or setting simply by shifting around the assumptions of what elements are common, uncommon, and rare. The rarities in the <em>Playtest Rulebook</em> are meant to show a good baseline for a typical Pathfinder campaign and make for a solid default if you're not straying to far from classic fantasy, but I can't wait until people start posting their modified schemes for all sorts of different concepts, from prehistoric to horror, and from low-magic (all magic is uncommon or rare) to super high fantasy mash-up (everything is common!).</p>

<h2>Mechanical Diversity without Cognitive Overload</h2>
<p>While some groups go for a kitchen sink approach to available options, many groups want to allow options from other books but are tend to stick to the core content because of the sheer mental load of learning, using, and preparing for all of those options, especially on the GM. With rarity, you have a framework for adding more material without just opening the fire hose: you start with common content (for a new group, probably the things labeled as common in the book) and you expand into mastering uncommon and rare content only as it appears in your game. If a particular rare spell hasn't shown up in the game, you don't have to worry about how it might interact with your character's build or your NPC's plot in the same way you might otherwise. A player can bring some desired uncommon or rare options to the GM, who can get a feel for the rules involved and decide when and how to introduce those options to the campaign. If the PC is interested in spells and items from ancient Osirion, perhaps the PCs find a new quest that takes them there, or is contacted by an Osirionologist NPC who's willing to trade her Osirian secrets for the PCs' help with a different adventure.</p>

<p>We love games with plenty of options, but we also want to consider fans who've told us that though they love new options, they started becoming overwhelmed by just how many options there are in Pathfinder First Edition. With the rarity system, you can enjoy the best of both worlds.</p>

<h2>Awesome Rewards</h2>
<p>One thing that can be tough in Pathfinder First Edition is giving a reward to a PC whose player has already looked up all the options and bought or crafted all the items they really want, learned all the spells they really want, and so on, even if some of those items and spells really seemed like they wouldn't be available on the open market. Rarity allows a GM to give rewards that aren't easily available without needing to homebrew a brand new item or ability every time, and allows players who gain rarer options to feel special and important.</p>

<p>When you emerge from a Thassilonian tomb with a rare spell few have seen in millennia, wizards' guilds might start salivating over that knowledge. Will you keep it to yourself? Will you sell it to select wizards for a pretty penny? Will you spread the knowledge to all who desire it, possibly making the spell uncommon or even common in your setting? Or will you keep it to yourself to show off for the spellcasters you meet who have never heard of it? Only you can decide, giving you the power to make a permanent mark on the setting.</p>

<p>So how are you most excited to use the new rarity system?</p>

Why don't you take a look through this <a href="/products/btpya1rr?Starfinder-Armory">catalog of brand-new weaponry</a>, and we'll find you a great weapon at an honest price.</p>

<p>What's that? You want powered armor? That guy's not here 'til next week. Besides, the best defense is a good offense&mdash;and I've got some real offensive stuff here! Take these disintegrator weapons&mdash;they'll melt your face&hellip; OFF! Well, your enemies' faces. Or face-like appendages. You know what I mean.</p>

<p>And hey, if disintegration isn't your style, not to worry! I've got more than 650 weapons on offer, in more than 150 makes, with 46 new weapon special properties and half a dozen critical hit effects. Wanna keep your hands free while blasting away with a shoulder laser? Put a weapon with the integrated special property into an armor upgrade slot! Wanna scare the nutrition paste outta your enemies? Hit em with a psychic-wave cannon and let its demoralize critical hit effect do the work! Whatever your preferred flavor of proactive self-defense, you'll find it here.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/20180712-ArmorySpread.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/20180712-ArmorySpread_500.jpeg"></a>
<br />This spread of weapons represents fewer than 5 percent of the new weapons in <a href="/products/btpya1rr?Starfinder-Armory"><i>Starfinder Armory</i></a>. Oddly specific developer note: <a href="/products/btpya1rr?Starfinder-Armory"><i>Armory</i></a> introduces 42 3rd-level weapons&mdash;auspicious!
<br /><i>Illustration by Kent Hamilton</i></p></div>

<p>And I'm not even counting the new ammunition (phasing sniper rounds strike your fancy?) or dozens of new grenades and solarian weapon crystals. So buy today&mdash;I'm even throwing in free installation of a sniper scope with the purchase of any small arm, or free integration of a null-space gunner harness with any heavy weapon. Why lug around that rail cannon when you could carry it in your pocket as a 1-1/2 inch disk? Of course, I'm happy to sell you any of two dozen other weapon accessories, if you prefer.</p>

<p>Great doing business with ya, and happy hunting!</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline">Pathfinder Society 3: Organized Playtest</h1>

<p class="date">Wednesday, July 11, 2018</p>

<div itemprop="articlebody">

<div class="blurbCenter" style="display:none;"><a href="/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PFSUpdates2.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PFSUpdates2_180.jpeg"></a></div>

<p itemprop="description">The past few months have been busy for the organized play team, from many of us traveling to give fans sneak peaks of <a href="/pathfinderplaytest">the Pathfinder Playtest</a> to our developing a huge number of scenarios to launch at PaizoCon, Origins, and Gen Con (more on those Gen Con adventures in several upcoming preview blogs). We've also been discussing many of the features in a Second Edition Pathfinder Society campaign, as we introduced in our <a href="/community/blog/v5748dyo5lklx?Pathfinder-Society-2-Expanding-on-the-FAQ">initial playtest blog</a> as well as the <a href="/community/blog/v5748dyo5lko1?Pathfinder-Society-2-Replay-Rewards-and-Rebuilds">blog that followed</a>. We'll be getting into some of our ideas&mdash;including some possibilities for incentivizing special events without gating material&mdash;and takeaways from your feedback shortly after Gen Con.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I want to confirm and reinforce what you'll be seeing at Gen Con and beyond for the Pathfinder Society Playtest.</p>

<h2>1: What to Play</h2>
<p>Paizo has created 11 different adventures for you to playtest, and we're including them all in the organized play playtest.</p>
<p><a href="/products/btpya0ag?Pathfinder-Playtest-Adventure-Doomsday-Dawn"><i>Pathfinder Playtest Adventure: Doomsday Dawn</i></a> (August 2nd): The biggest playtest adventure resource by far is this series of 7 adventures that span a wide range of levels. Some of these are "traditional" adventures, whereas others are designed to stress-test different parts of the game. A common estimate is that each of these adventures runs about twice the length of a Pathfinder Society scenario, though it will vary by your group, play style, and familiarity with the rules.</p>

<p><i><a href="/products/btpya1y3?Pathfinder-Society-Playtest-Scenario-1-The-Rose-Street-Revenge">Pathfinder Society Playtest #1: The Rose Street Revenge&nbsp;</a></i>(August 6th): This is a series of four quests (short adventures intended to take about 40-;60 minutes each). Explore Absalom, clash with a variety of foes, catch a murderer, and emerge as heroes.</p>

<p><a href="/products/btpya1y4?Pathfinder-Society-Playtest-Scenario-2-Raiders-of-Shrieking-Peak"><i>Pathfinder Society Playtest #2: Raiders of Shrieking Peak</i></a> (August 6th): This is a scenario (about 4-;5 hours) for 5th-level characters, taking the PCs into the Isle of Kortos's wilderness to rescue a missing comrade and recover a lost relic.</p>

<p><i><a href="/products/btpya1y5?Pathfinder-Society-Playtest-Scenario-3-Arclords-Envy">Pathfinder Society Playtest #3: Arclord's Envy</a></i> (August 6th): This is a scenario for 5th-level characters that takes place in the wondrously arcane nation Nex. Solve a murder in the capital city, where mages, golems, and elementals rule.</p>

<p><i>Pathfinder Society Playtest #4: The Frozen Oath</i> (September 26th): This is a scenario for 10th-level characters, taking the PCs into the frozen Crown of the World. There they'll fight with all manner of arctic menaces while uncovering an ancient ruin. We'll have a product page up for this scenario soon.</p>
<p>Beyond that, Paizo's also excited to receive any homebrew adventure data. Just keep in mind that 1) that style of game doesn't earn any organized play credit (see below) and that 2) one big advantage of having printed adventures to playtest is that they control for more variables in the playtest process and thus provide information that's easier to process and compare.</p>

<div class = "blurb360"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderSociety/20180711-Valeros.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderSociety/20180711-Valeros_360.jpeg"></a>
<p><i>Valeros is pumped and ready to playtest!</i></p></div>

<h2>2: Characters</h2>
<p>The playtest experience is distinct from the current Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild campaign. That means you aren't bringing your existing Pathfinder Society characters to the table&mdash;at least not directly. There are two different ways we're handling player characters.</p>

<p><b>Build Your Own Character:</b> In Pathfinder Society, you have to play a certain number of times to reach a particular level. In order to playtest a wide range of levels, we're not using that organic character growth model in the playtest. Instead, each of these adventures is made for characters of a particular level, and you get to build a character of that level and just show up.</p>

<p><b>Play a Pregenerated Character:</b> The organized play team is providing a set of pregenerated characters (we're currently working on six of them with a possible seventh character) at both 1st and 5th levels. That's perfect for Pathfinder Playtest Scenarios #1-3, especially when running <i>The Rose Street Revenge</i> as a demo or when playing these adventures at conventions. You can also use the 1st-level pregenerated characters for the first <i>Doomsday Dawn</i> adventure with some minor modifications&mdash;or your own home games, if you like.</p>

<p>Doesn't that leave plenty of adventures in which there won't be a pregenerated character option? Yes. We're providing a good array of pregens for our first few adventures, but creating pregenerated characters for all of the levels represented isn't practical. Paizo's also really interested to hear about the character-building process&mdash;if it was easy, intuitive, hard in places, et cetera. This does make it important to factor this into your playtest schedule, though (see the General Advice below).</p>

<h2>3: Earning Credit</h2>
<p>Back in March, we introduced <a href="/community/blog/v5748dyo5lko1?Pathfinder-Society-2-Replay-Rewards-and-Rebuilds">a "prize table" method of earning playtest credit</a> (see the end of the linked blog). The more we discussed and refined the concept, the more we liked it.</p>

<p><b>Playtest Points:</b> At the back of each Pathfinder Society Playtest scenario, you'll find a pair of half-page tracking sheets. Each asks you to record the adventure you played, the date completed, the GM's organized play number, the GM's initials, and a reminder to fill out that adventure's survey (see below). That means that instead of receiving a different Chronicle sheet for each adventure, you'll just fill in a single line of information. If you fill up your tracking sheet, just grab a new one and starting filling it in, too. Just keep these sheets together, much like you would your character's Chronicle sheets!</p>

<p>In addition, for each of these adventures you will earn a number of Playtest Points (PTP).&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Earn 1 PTP for each playtest quest played. It's absolutely fine to play all of <i>The Rose Street Revenge</i> in one sitting and record it as a single event.</li>
<li>Earn 4 PTP for each playtest scenario played.</li>
<li>Earn 4 PTP for each chapter of <i>Doomsday Dawn</i></li>
<li>For every 4 PTP someone earns by being a GM, they'll receive 1 bonus PTP.</li>
</ul>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderSociety/20180711-ReportingSheet.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderSociety/20180711-ReportingSheet_500.jpeg"></a></div>

<p>As we approach the launch of Pathfinder Society's Second Edition campaign, we'll post the different ways that you can redeem these points for special character options. These aren't intended as major power upgrades but rather as fun tools, backgrounds, and other options to thank you for contributing to the playtest process.</p>

<p><b>Replay:</b> You can freely replay these 11 playtest adventures for credit; in fact, you'll likely learn something new about the game each time you play an adventure. Just be sure your foreknowledge of any story and encounters doesn't ruin the experience for others at the table. We expect there will be plenty of playtest rewards, so by replaying some adventures and gaining extra PTP, those points aren't going to go to waste.</p>

<p><b>Reporting:</b> How are we tracking how many PTP you've earned? Although your tracking sheets are a handy record, you'll be purchasing rewards using your accumulated PTP reported on paizo.com. Yep, reporting is important. Think of this as a trial run for how we can provide ongoing rewards once we launch the new campaign, so help us report events dutifully so that we might distribute, say, ancestry boons in the future.</p>

<p>But what's your character name? Your character number? Your faction? Go ahead and make up a name used in playtesting. For your number, use <b>XXXXX-15XX</b> (for example, 11300-1501 for a first character, 11300-1502 for the second, etc.). It's easy to go overboard in creating characters by making loads of characters, so you might want to stick to just a few numbers or one character number per playtest class. Whichever strategy you choose, the playtest points you earn are cumulative to the campaign; you don't need to assign credit to the same character.</p>

<h2>4: Surveys</h2>
<p>Surveys are going to be a major vector for soliciting feedback during the playtest process, and that includes the organized play events. In addition to several general-purpose surveys, each of the playtest adventures will have associated surveys&mdash;often including a different survey for the players and for the GM&mdash;that seek scenario-specific information. Once the playtest launches at Gen Con on the first weekend of August, you'll be able to find these surveys at <a href="/pathfinderplaytest"><b>paizo.com/pathfinderplaytest</b></a>. Keep in mind that Paizo will periodically add more surveys to that site to secure more information and better pace the playtest feedback.</p>

<p>In particular when running chapters of <i>Doomsday Dawn</i>, keep in mind that there might be specific numbers to track during gameplay. If you are the GM, please take a look at the survey beforehand so that you can record these values and report them accurately later.</p>

<h2>5: General Advice</h2>
<p><b>Plan for Building Characters:</b> In the Characters section above, I noted that there will only 1st- and 5th-level pregenerated characters available. This comes with a really important consideration: plan for building characters <b>AT or BEFORE your playtest events</b>. That might mean gathering your group together the day before the event to run a character-building session. It might mean scheduling the event to start an hour earlier to build in time for this process. If someone shows up without a character for Pathfinder Society Playtest #1, 2, or 3, they can always grab a pregenerated character. For #4, though? It's important to have that character ready to go. Work out with your group, your store, or your community what makes the most sense.</p>

<p>How much gold does your higher-level character start with? Each PC should be built using the character wealth numbers for their respective levels found on page 348 of the <i>Pathfinder Playtest Rulebook</i> (see Table 11-2).</p>

<p><b>Plan for Teaching Rules:</b> I've now run many hours of our convention demo and the <i>Rose Street Revenge</i> quests, and I've found it's possible to convey a nice overview of the rules in about 10 minutes. However, I could readily stretch that out to three times that length, especially in answering questions. As with planning for building characters, you'll want to schedule a little time for teaching the rules.</p>

<p><b>Assess Your Area's Needs:</b> Just figure out what's best for your region, your gaming space, or your home group. It might make sense to run a few big events, meet regularly to run part of a scenario at a time, or create temporary playtesting groups to tackle the larger <i>Doomsday Dawn</i> adventures. Take the time to discuss it with your community. There's no one right answer.</p>

<p>We're excited to see what you think of the new edition and our excellent new adventures! Next week we'll provide previews of the upcoming July and August Pathfinder Society and Starfinder Society scenarios, and the following week we'll preview the increasingly imminent Pathfinder Playtest scenarios.</p>

Stephens! Though your heroes have tangled with agents of the Corpse Fleet in past volumes, this particular adventure has more undead than you can shake a stick at!</p>

<p>The <a href="/products/btpya1ai?Starfinder-Adventure-Path-Empire-of-Bones"><i>Empire of Bones</i></a> of the title is a massive ultranought flagship of the Corpse Fleet larger than some cities. It leads an armada of other hostile vessels, intent on seizing control of the ancient alien superweapon known as the Stellar Degenerator. Which would certainly mean the death of every living thing in the Pact Worlds system and possibly beyond. No pressure! Your characters have survived up this point, and are probably more than up to the task of infiltrating the <i>Empire of Bones</i> and taking over the bridge, right? You will only have to face bone troopers, corpsefolk, and ghouls, as well as Starfinder versions of baykoks, kurobozus, mohrgs, and pale strangers. Oh, and did I forget to mention the gatecrasher, a horrific blend of powered armor and necromancy-infused flesh?</p>

<p>Even with a few surprises along the way, this adventure is sure to be a walk in the park&mdash;no, not park. Graveyard. A walk in the graveyard. Enjoy and good luck!</p>

<h2>Bloodlines</h2>

<p>You pick your bloodline at 1st level, which tells you which spell list you use: arcane, divine, primal, or occult (the last of the four magical traditions, which we'll cover in a future blog!). It also defines some of the spells you know. For instance, the demonic bloodline gives you the divine spell list and the <i>fear</i> spell at 1st level, in addition to two other spells that you choose yourself from the divine list. In some cases, the special spells from your bloodline come from other lists. For example, the demonic bloodline gives you <i>slow</i> when you learn 3rd-level spells (for the sin of sloth) and <i>disintegrate</i> when you learn 6th-level spells. There are a couple more. How about we look at that whole bloodline entry and you can make your own guesses about which ones are from other lists?</p>

<blockquote>
<h2>Demonic</h2>
<p class = "stat-block-1">The demons of the Abyss debase all they touch, and one of your ancestors fell victim to their corruption. You're burdened with dark thoughts and the desire for destruction. This urge can be overcome if you choose to fight it, but the beauty of sin calls to you always.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Spell List</b> divine (<i>Pathfinder Playtest Rulebook</i> 200)</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Signature Skills</b> Athletics, Deception, Intimidation, Religion</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Granted Spells</b> Cantrip: <i>detect magic</i>; 1st: <i>fear</i>; 2nd: <i>resist energy</i>; 3rd: <i>slow</i>; 4th: <i>divine wrath</i>; 5th: <i>banishment</i>; 6th: <i>disintegrate</i>; 7th: <i>divine decree</i>; 8th: <i>power word stun</i>; 9th: <i>meteor swarm</i></p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Bloodline Powers</b> Initial Power: <i>glutton's jaws</i>; Advanced Power: <i>swamp of sloth</i> (2); Greater Power: <i>abyssal wrath</i> (2)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can see that the bloodline also determines your most important skills and gives you some bloodline powers. We've talked about powers before (see the <a href="/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkqb?Cleric-Class-Preview">cleric preview</a>. These are special spells you can get only from specific classes, and they are cast using Spell Points rather than spell slots. They also automatically heighten to the highest level of spell you can cast. You start out with a number of Spell Points per day equal to your Charisma modifier, and if you have the demonic bloodline, you gain the<i> glutton's jaws </i>power, which you can cast at a cost of 1 Spell Point.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class = "stat-block-title">Glutton's Jaws <span class = "stat-block-cr">Power 1</span></p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">Necromancy</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Casting </b>[[A]] Somatic Casting, [[A]] Verbal Casting</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Duration</b> 1 minute</p>
<hr style = "margin: 0.5rem 0;" />
<p class = "stat-block-1">Your mouth transforms into a shadowy maw bristling with pointed teeth. These jaws grant you an unarmed attack you're trained in, dealing 1d6 piercing damage. They have the finesse trait.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">Attacks with your jaws have the following enhancement.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Enhancement</b> If the target was living, gain 1d4 temporary HP.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Heightened (2nd)</b> Your jaws gain the effects of a <i>+1 weapon potency rune</i> (a +1 item bonus to attack rolls and an additional damage die) and the temporary Hit Points increase to 2d4.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Heightened (4th)</b> The jaws gain the effects of a <i>+2 weapon potency rune</i> and the temporary Hit Points increase to 3d4.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Heightened (6th)</b> The jaws gain the effects of a <i>+3 weapon potency rune</i> and the temporary Hit Points increase to 4d4.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Heightened (8th)</b> The jaws gain the effects of a <i>+4 weapon potency rune</i> and the temporary Hit Points increase to 5d4.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At higher levels, you'll get to make a swampy morass that makes creatures slothful or call forth the dangers of an Abyssal realm.</p>

<p>The number of bloodlines in the <em>Pathfinder Playtest Rulebook</em> is fairly small, since we want to see how people react to the new style of the class with just a subset of the bloodlines. In the book, you'll see the following bloodlines: aberrant (occult), angelic (divine), demonic (divine), draconic (arcane), fey (primal) and imperial (arcane). That last one comes from the magical traditions of ancient mortals and matches our iconic sorcerer, Seoni!</p>

<h2>Spontaneous Spellcasting</h2>
<p>This is our first preview of a spontaneous spellcaster! The sorcerer gets the same number of spells per day as a wizard, but she has a number of spells she knows permanently instead of preparing them from a spellbook every day. The spells she knows make up her spell repertoire. That means she can choose which spell to cast each time she casts a spell instead of needing to plan ahead. It's worth noting that the sorcerer now learns spells at the same character level as the wizard: 2nd-level spells at 3rd level, 3rd-level spells at 5th level, and so on.</p>

<p>As you level up, you learn new spells and can replace some of the spells you previously had with new ones. This lets you get rid of some spells that were great options when they were at your highest level but maybe aren't worth casting anymore.</p>

<p>The sorcerer's spellcasting is based on her inborn magical potency, so she uses her Charisma for her spell rolls and spell DCs. Because Charisma also adds to Resonance Points, the sorcerer can make up for some of her limited spell choice compared to the wizard's spellbook by supplementing her spell selection with more scrolls, staves, and wands.</p>

<h2>Sorcerer Features</h2>
<p>Many of the sorcerer's class features were explained under bloodline, as most of them tie back to that choice. The sorcerer gains her advanced power at 6th level and her greater bloodline power at 10th level. As with other spellcasters, her proficiency with spell rolls and spell DCs increases to expert at 12th level, master at 16th, and legendary at 19th.</p>

<p>The sorcerer gets one other class feature, called spontaneous heightening. As mentioned before, some spells in your lower-level spell slots get less useful as you go up in level. However, there are some spells you might want to cast with any of your slots. The spontaneous heightening feature lets you choose two spells at the start of each day that you can cast as their heightened versions using any of your spell slots. That means that if you want your angelic sorcerer to be able to cast 1st-level <i>heal</i>, 2nd-level <i>heal</i>, and 3rd-level <i>heal</i>, you can choose your 1st-level <i>heal</i> spell with spontaneous heightening rather than needing to learn the spell in your spell repertoire at all three spell levels. Then you can cast a 1st-level <i>heal</i> to top off someone's Hit Points when they're almost at full and still cast a 3rd-level <i>heal </i>in the middle of a fight to really save someone from the brink!</p>

<h2>Sorcerer Feats</h2>
<p>The sorcerer's feats primarily deal with her spells. Sorcerers get metamagic feats, many of which they share with other casters. One we haven't shown off yet is Overwhelming Spell at 8th level, which lets a spell that deals acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage ignore the first 10 points of a target's resistance.</p>

<p>If you want to make a blaster, you can pick up Dangerous Sorcery, which increases the damage of your spells by their spell level (with the exception of cantrips). You can also take Blood Magic at 8th level, which uses the magical potential in your blood to grant temporary Hit Points to you or a target of your spell if you're bleeding when you cast it.</p>

<p>One of my favorite cycles of feats are the evolution feats, which reinforce the themes of each magical tradition. Arcane Evolution makes your arcane sorcerer trained in a skill and lets you add a spell from a scroll to your spell repertoire for the day when you prepare each morning. Divine Evolution lets you channel energy like a cleric. Occult Evolution gives you a skill and lets you pick a spell with the mental trait to add to your repertoire each day. Finally, Primal Evolution lets you cast <i>summon nature's ally</i> as an innate spell once per day at the highest spell level you can cast.</p>

<p>How about a 20th-level feat? Sorcerers can take a feat to gain 10th-level spells of their tradition, but you might want to look at other options, like Wellspring Spell. This metamagic feat lets you cast a 5th-level or lower spell once per minute without expending the spell slot!</p>

<p>What sort of predictions do you have for the bloodlines? What spells will they get? Does this new scheme make you more or less likely to play a sorcerer? Do you want to try out a gnome fey sorcerer? How about an angelic sorcerer with the <i>heal</i> spell? Let us know in the comments, and start preparing for when you get the book!</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline">It’s a Trap!</h1>
<p class="date">Friday, July 6, 2018</p>

<div itemprop="articleBody">

<div class="blurbCenter" style="display: none;"><a href="/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20180326-Preview2.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20180326-Preview2_360.jpeg"></a></div>

<p itemprop="description">Hazards are some of the most common challenges in Pathfinder, apart from monsters, and the most common hazards are traps. Most of the hazards in the Pathfinder Playtest are traps, but there are also environmental hazards like mold and quicksand, or even haunts. Rather than have different rules for each type of hazard, in the playtest, hazards all have a unified format, though how you might find them and deal with them can be quite different.</p>

<h2>Noticing a Hazard</h2>
<p>Most hazards can be noticed using Perception, although simple or obvious magical hazards are easily noticeable via <i>detect magic </i>and similar magic. Some hazards are so easy to locate that you might notice them even if you aren't even searching. Other hazards might be created or hidden in a particularly devious way and require a certain proficiency rank to notice them before it's too late, even if you're searching. (The rogue's Trap Finder feat improves this even further in the case of traps, but any character with legendary Perception can find any Perception-based hazard&mdash;not just rogues!) These harder-to-locate hazards don't appear until higher levels, since it's incredibly unlikely to encounter a level 1 trap created by a legendary crafter, though that doesn't mean all high-level hazards are hard to notice. For instance, the most dangerous example hazard below, the Armageddon Orb, is trivial for almost anyone to notice.</p>

<h2>Disabling a Hazard</h2>
<p>The skill needed to disable a hazard varies. Traps are usually disabled via Thievery, environmental hazards via Nature or Survival, and haunts via Occultism or Religion, though there are exceptions in every category. Many hazards require a certain number of successes before they are fully disabled, and a critical success typically counts as two successes. A critical failure means you've accidentally triggered the hazard! Many physical hazards can also be destroyed by brute force. In many cases, breaking the trigger mechanism might set the trap off prematurely, which you might be able to do from a safe distance. We felt it was really important to make dealing with hazards a more narrative experience without taking lots of extra time or requiring the GM to make up details on the spot, and so every skill that can be used to disable a hazard is listed in the stat block, along with a description of the how a PC would use that skill to do so.</p>

<h2>Simple or Complex?</h2>
<p>Out of everything in the playtest, hazards may be the one component for which you can get the best preview right now. How? Starfinder. We had already created an early framework for hazards by the time Starfinder came around, so when I was asked to create a framework for Starfinder's traps, I adapted what we had for the Pathfinder Playtest, and the rest of the <a href="/products/btpy9qy1"><em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em></a> team liked what they saw. We've refined the playtest's system since then, which means that we have two main types of hazards: simple hazards that trigger, take their reaction, and are then done, and complex hazards that roll into initiative and shift the game into encounter mode until the PCs deal with them (or at least escape).</p>

<h2>For Example&hellip;</h2>
<p>Let's take a look at several sample hazards!</p>

<blockquote>
<p class = "stat-block-title">Hidden Pit <span class = "stat-block-cr">Hazard 0</span></p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">Mechanical, Trap</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Stealth</b> DC 16</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Description</b> A trapdoor covers a 10-foot-square pit that is 20 feet deep.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Disable</b> Thievery DC 12 to remove the trapdoor, making the trap no longer hidden (Perception DC 0 to notice)</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>AC</b> 10, <b>TAC</b> 7; <b>Fort</b> +1, <b>Ref</b> +1</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Hardness</b> 4 (trapdoor); <b>Immunities</b> critical hits, object immunities, precision damage</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">[[R]] <b>Pitfall</b></p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Trigger</b> A creature walks onto the trapdoor.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Effect</b> The triggering creature falls in and takes falling damage (typically 10 bludgeoning damage). That creature can use the Grab Edge reaction to avoid falling.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Reset</b> The trap still causes falling damage if anyone falls in, but the trapdoor must be reset manually for the trap to become hidden again.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ah, the pit, the most basic of all simple traps. Anybody can find a hidden pit, even if they aren't searching for it, because the Stealth DC doesn't require a proficiency rank. If someone walks onto the trapdoor, the pit uses its reaction to open up, and the triggering creature might fall. The Disable entry explains how a character can pop the trapdoor off and make the pit obvious to all. Still might want to be careful crossing, though!</p>

<blockquote>
<p class = "stat-block-title">Armageddon Orb <span class = "stat-block-cr">Hazard 23</span></p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">Magical, Trap</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Stealth</b> DC 10 or <i>detect magic</i></p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Description</b> A roiling red orb, forged from a drop of Rovagug's blood, rains fire from the sky when a specified condition is met.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Disable</b> Thievery DC 51 (legendary) to imbue thieves' tools with aspects representing Asmodeus and Sarenrae and use them to drain away the orb's power over 10 minutes, taking 5 fire damage each round during that time</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">[[R]] <b>Burn It All</b> (divine, evocation, fire)</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Trigger</b> A special condition set by the trap's creator, typically on the event of her death.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Effect</b> Fire rains from the sky in a 100-mile radius, dealing 10d6 fire damage to creatures and objects in the area (Reflex DC 46 for half damage, or no damage on a critical success). Any creature reduced to 0 Hit Points in this way dies instantly. This is not enough damage to completely burn away a forest or level a mountain or city, but it typically kills most creatures in the area.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This one was pure, over-the-top fun to write. What would a level 23 hazard even look like? This one is really obvious but incredibly difficult to disable. The effect's damage is not even remotely a threat to high-level PCs&mdash;but if they care about any NPCs in the region, chances are they're not going to want to set this thing off!</p>

<blockquote>
<p class = "stat-block-title">Bloodthirsty Urge <span class = "stat-block-cr">Hazard 10</span></p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">Haunt</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Stealth</b> DC 29 (trained)</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Description</b> An object imbued with echoes of a vicious mind tries to kill someone who comes near.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Disable</b> Religion DC 27 (master) to exorcise the spirit or Diplomacy DC 29 (expert) to talk it down</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">[[R]] <b>Quietus</b> (emotion, fear, illusion, mental, occult)</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Trigger</b> A creature moves within 10 feet of the haunted object.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Effect</b> The haunt takes control of the triggering creature, forcing it to attack itself. The creature is affected by <i>phantasmal killer</i> (DC 25), except that instead of mental damage, the damage type is based on a weapon the creature has drawn, an object it holds, or its unarmed attack damage if it's holding nothing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here's an example of a haunt. As you can see, it uses the same basic framework as the other hazards, so once you learn the rules, you can use them flexibly for almost any hazard you can dream up! In this case, a PC could use Religion to exorcise the haunt, but a character could also potentially use Diplomacy to talk it down. Still, the master of Religion has the advantage with an easier DC. You could even imagine an adventure where it matters how the PCs deal with a hazard. Perhaps exorcising a haunt using Religion helps sanctify the area, while using Diplomacy might persuade the spirit to impart some hints to the PCs about what happened before it departs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class = "stat-block-title">Spinning Blade Pillar <span class = "stat-block-cr">Hazard 4</span></p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">Complex, Mechanical, Trap</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Stealth</b> +10 (trained) or DC 24 (expert) to notice the control panel</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Description</b> A metal pole with three razor-sharp spinning blades is hidden in the floor, connected to trigger plates in up to eight floor tiles and a hidden control panel within 30 feet.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Disable</b> Thievery DC 18 (trained) twice on the pillar, or Thievery DC 16 (expert) once on the control panel deactivates the entire trap</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>AC</b> 19, <b>TAC</b> 15; <b>Fort</b> +6, <b>Ref</b> +10</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Hardness</b> 11 (2 dents) on the pillar, denting the panel causes the trap to stay constantly active and prevents disabling the panel; <b>Immunities</b> critical hits, object immunities, precision damage</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">[[R]] <b>Rising Pillar</b> (attack)</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Trigger</b> A creature steps on one of the floor tiles.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Effect</b> The trap pops up in a grid intersection and makes a spinning blade attack against one adjacent creature (if any), then rolls initiative.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Routine</b> (3 actions) On its initiative, the trap spends its first action making a spinning blade attack against each adjacent creature, its second action to move straight in a random direction (roll 1d4 to determine the direction), and its third action to attack each adjacent creature. This trap doesn't take a multiple attack penalty.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Speed</b> 10 ft.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">[[A]] <b>Melee</b> spinning blade +12, <b>Damage</b> 2d10+5 slashing</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Reset</b> The trap deactivates and resets after 1 minute.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the first complex trap ever created for the game. It was also responsible for the first death in the game, as Logan kept rolling randomly for the blade's movement, which just happened to be wherever Stephen's rogue had moved while trying to avoid it&mdash;and then it rolled right back over him after he fell unconscious. Note that the complex trap has a Stealth bonus, rather than just a DC, since it actually rolls for initiative in encounter mode (using Stealth). If your party has an expert in Thievery who can find the hidden panel (we didn't; our expert lay bleeding on the ground), this hazard is actually a breeze to disable, but even a trained character can disable it with patience, and a not-so-patient character can always smash it apart with enough big hits to deal 11 or more damage.</p>

<p>So what do you think? Care to hazard an opinion?</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline">July Stars, Volunteers, Conventions & More!</h1>

<p class="date">Wednesday, July 4, 2018</p>

<div itemprop="articlebody">

<div class="blurbCenter" style="display:none;"><a href="/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PFSUpdates2.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PFSUpdates2_180.jpeg"></a></div>

<p itemprop="description">Happy Independence Day to our players and volunteers in the US, happy “got rid of them” day to the United Kingdom community and a belated Happy Canada Day to our neighbors up north! The first whirlwind of convention is over and I'm taking a day to rest, relax, and enjoy friends and family. Thursday, I'll be back with my nose to the grindstone, working on all the tasks needed to bring the Sagamore Ballroom at Gen Con to life, planning out the last few bits of travel for 2018, and looking at plans for 2019 and beyond.</p>

<p>To our volunteers, some good news! I've updated all requests dated through June 17th. I'm pulling down the next batch this week and will work on getting those processed. So if your waiting on being named a Venture-Officer, haven't seen an update to your account, and the request was filed before June 17th, please have the request resubmitted.  To all new venture officers, welcome to the team.  To those leaving the venture-officer team, thank you for your efforts in making your gaming community thrive!</p>

<h2>Campaign Coin</h2>
<p>During the staff trip to Origins in Columbus, I had the opportunity to recognize two outstanding volunteers. One is currently a bedrock of the Cincinnati volunteer community, as well as returning Origins volunteer. Please congratulate <b>Brent Bowser</b>, whose new org play number is 793.</p>

<p>The second recipient is a familiar face in the Northeast region. He spent countless hours as a Venture-Lieutenant and then a Venture-Captain, as well being a mainstay organizer of org play at the annual <a href = "http://www.thebodhanagroup.org/about-the-convention" target = "_blank">Save vs. Fear event</a> put on by the Bodhana group. For his efforts in the community, we recognized <b>Bobby Harring</b> with a campaign service coin #794.</p>

<p>If you know a deserving member of your community, please email me at organizedplay@paizo.com with their name, location, and the reasons you feel they should be recognized for their service. If you are able, please include what events they may attend in 2018. This is especially helpful if they will be at an event with a member of the organized play team (see further down the blog for that list of events.)</p>

<h2>Stars and Novas</h2>
<p>Convention season and a robust gaming schedule came together to provide more Pathfinder Society GMs with a chance to earn their 5th Star. To achieve this milestone, GMs facilitate 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 are special scenarios, as well as run a game for a venture-captain. A conservative estimate of time needed to reach 5-stars is 650 hours! To the GMs listed below, congratulations on reaching this milestone! To all GMs that achieved 5* status, thank you very much for the time and energy you spend running Pathfinder Society games! Your efforts are greatly appreciated.</p>

<ul><li>William Cheung</li>
<li>Albert Cohen</li>
<li>Daniel Knipfer</li>
<li>Maggie Keeble</li>
<li>Ian McHugh</li></ul>

<p>Starfinder Society has a few GMs that reached their 3-nova milestone in the month of June. After reading through much discussion on both what GMs would like to see in Starfinder Society and what GMs hope to have for Pathfinder Society 2, I think we are close to having a process for awarding a 5th Nova. I'm working to put it together for the Org Play team. From there it will go to the Venture-Officer team and then to our players. It is my intention to have a commentary period before we put it into play and will link any discussion threads in a future blog.</p>

<h2>Volunteer Opportunities</h2>
<p>We still have badges and rooms available for Gen Con volunteers. If you are interested in volunteering to run events, especially Starfinder Society or the Interactives, please visit <a href = "https://goo.gl/forms/pxUyPSyeIK9dfwbl2" target = "_blank">the Gen Con 2018 volunteer questionnaire</a> for more information and to register. To sweeten the pot a bit more, one of the GM rewards is a copy of a book and one of the available choices is the Pathfinder Playtest Rulebook.</p>

<h2>Convention Listing</h2>
<p>Feedback is that our publishing the convention schedule helps our players and GMs allocate their free time. So we will continue to do so! Here is the current list of all events that requested support from the Organized Play team. All of the conventions on the list maintain some type of web presence, be it website, social media page, or Warhorn listing, so if you are interested in attending in either capacity, check out their websites or contact the local venture-officer for more information! If you know of a convention running Society games that is not on this list, encourage the organizer to contact me at <a href = "mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com">organizedplay@paizo.com</a> to discuss their event.</p>

<h2>2018 Organized Play Staff Travel</h2>
<p>I've updated the organized play staff itinerary for the rest of 2018. These aren't all the events that will have Paizo staffers in attendance and some of the events have staff members beyond the organized play team. If you're at any of the events listed below, please stop by the booth or organized play space and say hi!</p>

<p>If you are an event organizer and want to invite us out at your event in 2019, drop an email to organizedplay@paizo.com before next summer. I'm working on compiling all of the requests now and am looking to submit a preliminary schedule to Paizo executives in August, so that we can try to get all decisions wrapped by the end of the year.</p>

  <h1>Farewell to Crystal</h1>
  <p class="date"><time datetime="2018-07-03T19:00:00Z">Jul 3, 2018, 12:00 pm</time></p>
  <p itemprop="description">A couple of weeks ago Crystal Frasier let me know that she'd be moving on from Paizo to focus on her freelancer career. I was terribly saddened by this news, but I can't say I was wholly surprised. Crystal is an excellent developer and writer, but she's also an amazing artist, illustrator, cartographer, and has been knocking it out of the park with her comics. However, don't fret too much, Crystal has told me that she still wants to write for us as a freelancer, so you'll still be getting her top-notch adventures, monsters, and articles on some of the things she loves. As we do here at Paizo when one of our greats departs, I've collected some heartfelt thoughts and well wishes from the staff to send Crystal off!</p>

However, don't fret too much, Crystal has told me that she still wants to write for us as a freelancer, so you'll still be getting her top-notch adventures, monsters, and articles on some of the things she loves. As we do here at Paizo when one of our greats departs, I've collected some heartfelt thoughts and well wishes from the staff to send Crystal off!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Jason Tondro (Editor): </b>"I've only had the pleasure of knowing Crystal as a coworker for a few months, but I have long admired her work in and for the industry. Crystal has made gaming both smarter and more just, and it's no surprise that she's now got so much work on her plate that she can't afford to stay with us here at Paizo. But in this case, what's bad for Paizo is good for everyone, and I'm looking forward to seeing more of Crystal's work on an even larger stage. Sincere congratulations, Crystal, and please just keep on doing what you're doing."</p>

<p><b>Chris Sims (Developer): </b>"Unfortunately for me, I don't yet know Crystal as well as I might have liked. I do know she brings a ton of craft and skill to this team. More than that, though, she adds a lot of humor and insight. I can't count how many times we've all enjoyed a moment of levity or I've been left rethinking something because of what Crystal said during a conversation or meeting. It's plain we're all better off with her here. It's also clear we'll miss her when she's not. That said, we're lucky she'll still be available for freelance gigs. Don't forget about us, Crystal! All the best to you, too!"</p>

<p><b>Owen KC Stephens (Starfinder Design Lead):</b> "Crystal was one of the people I was most excited to get to work with when I was hired at Paizo, and I can safely say the experience has been very much worth it. Her game industry career goes back longer than mine does and she's succeeded at many more roles, giving her a vast wealth of knowledge and experience I've been happy to draw on and learn from. As sad as I am to lose her from my daily work routine, I am excited to see what she does in her new endeavors!</p>
<p>We'll miss you Crystal!"</p>

<p><b>Adam Daigle (Managing Developer):</b> "I'm not crying, YOU'RE CRYING!</p>
<p>Over the years I have known Crystal as a friend, freelancer, and then coworker. When I first came to Paizo, Crystal was in another department, so I didn't get to see her that much during the normal workday, but when she moved into the editorial department as a developer, we sat right next to each other. We were both working on the Adventure Paths and had each other to cheer on, commiserate with, and of course crack jokes with. We both grew up on the Gulf Coast and have a shared love for trash animals, and we often loved to confuse and weird out other members of the crew with our strange bayou lore. I'm not only going to miss not having my swamp sister around for those reasons, but also because Crystal is brilliantly creative, extremely funny, and one of the most skilled storytellers I've had the pleasure to read and work with. Kick ass on your future endeavors, Crystal! I can't wait to see what you create!"</p>

<p><b>Mark Seifter (Designer):</b> "I first learned who Crystal was roughly 7 years ago, when I started to realize that so many of my favorite Pathfinder Society scenarios, and my favorite module The Harrowing, were written by the same author, and I first met her when she gave me a Harrow reading at the Paizocon Grand Convocation. I later learned that Crystal is as talented at so many other aspects of adventure development as she is at writing adventures, whether it be maps and art, characterization, plotline, you name it. For my money, Crystal's adventures are some of the best in the business, and it's really no surprise that my Pathfinder group opted to play Ironfang Invasion followed by War for the Crown. Those Adventure Paths are just that good, and if you're reading this and haven't checked them out yet, you should. Crystal leaving to pursue full-time freelance is a loss for Paizo, but our loss is the freelancing community's gain. I'll be looking for her name on all sorts of exciting new projects now, just like 7 years ago. But honestly? I never stopped."</p>

<p><b>Sonja Morris (Art Director):</b> "When I started at Paizo, Crystal was a member of the art department, and she helped me navigate the complex web that <i>was</i> our file storage system. Without Crystal's assistance, I am certain the <i>Pathfinder Adventure Card Game: Rise of the Runelords</i> would not have made it to the printer on time, and I don't know what I would have done without her help! Her quick wit is always good for a giggle, or a belly laugh, depending on the gag. Over the years, as she's moved around the company, I have seen her grow both professionally and personally and I can't wait to see what she does next. I am sure what ever it is it will be magnificent!"</p>

</div>

<p><b>Ron Lundeen (Developer):</b> "I have nothing but wonderful things to say about Crystal, and that probably frustrates her a lot. We've worked closely together as freelancer-developer for years, and as cubicle mates for just over 6 months. She's highly regarded in this industry (and others!) precisely because she's insightful, talented, and really, really hardworking. Early on, Crystal insisted that my relentless optimism wouldn't spoil her crusty pessimism (you'll see she put a Pessimist campaign trait in the Tyrant's Grasp Player's Guide to reinforce her position). And oh, how I've tried! In the end, though, I'm counting her departure as a checkmark on the optimism side of the board, because she's going on to exciting products, fun work, and a great life&mdash;you'll see!"</p>

<p><b>Linda Zayas-Palmer (Developer):</b> "The first time I talked to Crystal was right after a panel at PaizoCon 5 or 6 years ago. I'd recently had a wonderful time running a module she wrote, the Harrowing. I remember sitting there starstruck for a while, psyching myself up to go up to her and tell her how much I loved her writing and to compliment her awesome purple hair. I can't really call this meeting Crystal, since in my excitement, I forgot to introduce myself and just awkwardly fangirled over her for a few minutes. She was very nice about it though :)</p>
<p>I met Crystal for real when she started working as a developer right around the same time that I joined Paizo. And I have to say, I admire her more now than I did as a fan. Crystal is a compassionate, funny, and extremely talented person. She is a wellspring of creative ideas, lovely art, punny humor, and references to 80's and 90's pop culture. It's been a pleasure to be on a team with her. We'll miss you, Crystal! Whatever projects you take on next, I'm sure you'll knock them out of the park."</p>

<p><b>Jason Keeley (Developer):</b> "I have only known Crystal for a couple of years, but the nice things I have to say about her could probably fill a hardcover. She is talented, funny, clever, and only threatened to drink me under the table like once or twice. We are going to miss her so much. Hopefully, I will still get to game with her so this better not be goodbye forever! We still have that "Pigs in Space" campaign to do!"</p>

<p><b>Lyz Liddell (Editor):</b> "Crystal is the game designer I want to be when I grow up. She's brilliant, creative, fun, passionate, clever, dedicated to positive and diverse representation in our products, and not afraid to speak her mind. I've learned a ton by working on the materials she's developed, and I'm going to miss working with her."</p>

<p><b>Leo Glass (Editor):</b> "While I haven't worked with Crystal long, it was clear on day one how her endless creativity and sense of humor make the world around her a better place. I will miss all the laughter she brought to our team, but wish her the best of luck with her next journey. (And look forward to reading all of the super-awesome products she plans to write!)"</p>

<p><b>Stephen Radney-MacFarland (Senior Designer):</b> "I met Crystal before I came to Paizo. She was in the first game design class I ever taught at the Art Institute of Seattle. She was a fantastic student, someone who I always knew would go far in any pursuit. She had this tremendous mix of analytical force and creative talent that I enjoyed and respected. Hell, I still do. She's only gotten better at her various crafts. Crystal leaving Paizo is a loss for us as a company, but is to the benefit of all the rest of geekdom and beyond. Go forth and conquer, Crystal. It is your destiny."</p>

<p><b>John Compton (Organized Play Lead Developer):</b> "Before I joined Paizo in 2013, I only knew Crystal by reputation, from her module-writing fame to fan's gushing experiences about her Harrow readings at PaizoCon. After five years with her as my colleague, I can confirm that whatever positive things you've heard? They're true. Anything negative? You can't prove it; we helped her hide the bodies.</p>
<p>Crystal's a wonderful coworker and collaborator, especially in smaller meetings where we can feed on one another's enthusiasm and build upon each other's ideas as happened with projects like War for the Crown. She brings a playfulness to brainstorming, passion to adventures, and a range of accents to the gaming table&mdash;all while being so practiced in visual arts that she can idly illustrate characters or sketch maps with more skill than the rest of us can manage with our undivided attention. Beyond that, she's been an outspoken advocate for diversity in Paizo's products, promoting minorities' visibility in our stories in positive ways and showing the rest of us how we can do the same.</p>
<p>Crystal has been a source of inspiration and wisdom in my time at Paizo, and it's helped push me to try and return the favor at least half as often. I hope that we'll have more opportunities to collaborate in the future."</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20180703-Lunch1.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20180703-Lunch1_500.jpeg"></a>

<p><b>Logan Bonner (Designer): </b>"What an utterly delightful person. What a talented, engaged, and thoughtful coworker. What a champion for justice and compassion. Since I came to Paizo, I've been amazed by Crystal over and over. She's an excellent example, out there being an inspiration to new writers that not only can they do this, they might someday be <i>almost as good as Crystal Frasier</i>.</p>
<p>Crystal has been an institution here at Paizo, and now she's going off to become her own institution. A majestic, terrifying institution.</p>
<p>As she sails off into the sunset aboard her Footski, I can almost hear her cursing our names, but kindly, as is her way. We'll miss that clever cursing. Thank you for being a friend, a colleague, and a force of nature. Dammit, we'll miss you!"</p>

<p><b>Amanda Hamon Kunz (Managing Developer): </b>"When I first started working at Paizo three years ago, I was star struck by the thought that I would be working with <i>the</i> Crystal Frasier. Crystal was a titan of the industry&mdash;a woman who had done so much, from designing and laying out products to creating awesome art to writing some truly impressive first- and third-party products. But once I walked into the office, I realized that not only are all of those things absolutely true, even more than I realized as a freelancer, but that Crystal is also one of the most creative, most energetic, most uniquely awesome people I have met. As the months and years rolled on, Crystal taught me a lot about being a creative, but she also taught me how to be a better person and how to always fight for what I believe is right. She became one of my closest friends in the office, and I'm a better person for it. Crystal, as sad as I am to see you leave, and as much as I will deeply miss your incredible presence here, I know that you have fantastic things ahead of you. I can't wait to see what you do next. I will always be here to cheer you along from the sidelines."</p>

<p><b>Judy Bauer (Managing Editor):</b> "Crystal cares a LOT, and it shows. Her writing is always exciting, with frequent moments of hilarity (the attack of the crawling hands in <i>Pathfinder Adventure Path #79</i>!), but when it's serious, it's SERIOUS&mdash;her foreword to <i>Pathfinder Adventure Path #117</i> brought me to tears. It also shows in her relationships at work: she's been a mentor, a friend, and a source of inspiration for many at Paizo over the years. And it shows in her life: she's politically active, and a strong voice for representation and justice. I'm going to miss her enthusiasm and intensity so much!</p>
<p>Crystal, all the best luck with your (many) new ventures, and I hope to get to edit much more of your awesome writing in the future!"</p>

<p><b>Chris Carey (Senior Editor):</b> "I've known Crystal for almost ten years now. She first came on board as an intern in Paizo's art department when we were still over at the old office building, and I think she may be the most recent hire to be able to still remember the stained carpets and the tiny, cramped workspace that penned in the editorial staff over there. Of course, Crystal left the art department back in the day and has been an outstanding game developer and Pathfinder writer for years now, both developing and authoring some of the most enjoyable and creative turnovers to come across the editors' desks. But more than that, she has made Paizo a more enjoyable place to work with her laughter and wit and uniquely Crystal sense of humor. I'll miss you, Crystal, but I'm excited for the path that lies ahead of you!"</p>

<p><b>Mark Moreland (Franchise Manager): </b>"I first met Crystal at the second PaizoCon, way back in 2009. I recall her approaching Erik Mona and Sarah Robinson about possibly interning at Paizo and how envious I was of her simply for living in close proximity to the office and having the guts to get a foot in the door. Just over a year later, I moved across the country to join her at Paizo, and she was one of my most helpful cube-mates until the first of many desk reshuffles happened. Every time the ongoing game of musical cubes put us near one another, I was always ecstatic. There are many fun people in this office, but few are as funny, intelligent, and creative as Crystal, and she has an aura effect that gives morale bonuses to these same stats to everyone in a 30-foot radius.</p>
<p>I first developed Crystal's work when I tackled her innovative Pathfinder Society Scenario, <i>Below the Silver Tarn</i> just a few months after I took over the Pathfinder Society Organized Play campaign back in 2010. Her unique encounter designs, incredible mapping skills, and layered storytelling quickly put her at the top of my "would work with again" list, and made her the ideal candidate to write one of my all-time favorite Pathfinder adventures, <i>Pathfinder Module: The Harrowing</i>. We knew we wanted to make an adventure wherein the PCs travel inside a harrow deck and meet the creatures and threats on the cards themselves, and there was no one else on the list of potential authors other than Crystal. Her ability to interweave 54 random illustrations into a cohesive narrative with a deep, expansive mythology and a subsystem of using the harrow deck itself to augment gameplay resulted in a product I am incredibly proud to have worked on.</p>
<p>That's not the only time Crystal made me look good, either. I had the pleasure of working closely with her on the back matter of the Ironfang Invasion and War for the Crown adventure paths, and she developed <i>Taldor, The First Empire</i> into a better final book. She's also had an immeasurable influence on how I look at issues of inclusion and diversity in game design, and the different perspectives she brought to the creative process over the years has made an indelible mark on my narrative sensibilities.</p>
<p>I'll miss having you around the office, Crystal, but am overjoyed that you've promised to continue writing for both Pathfinder and Starfinder in your newfound free(lance) time. The future for someone with your myriad talents is certainly bright, and I wish you all the best. Don't be a stranger!"</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline">Ranger Class Preview</h1>
<p class="date">Monday, July 2, 2018</p>

<div itemprop="articleBody">

<div class="blurbCenter" style="display: none;"><a href="/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20180702-Preview.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20180702-Preview_360.jpeg"></a></div>

<p itemprop="description">Rangers have a long tradition in heroic adventure. Whether they're portrayed as lone striders keeping the edges of the wilderness free of the threats that lurch forth from the world's shadows, as hunters tracking down fugitives or beasts, or as skilled archers serving as a scouting force for a local lord or group of village elders, rangers have a special place in our fantastical imagination.</p>

<p>For the Pathfinder Playtest, we decided to cleave closer to the core principles of the ranger&mdash;a rough and tumble warrior in the wild, possibly of the wild himself. Because of this, the most significant change we made to the class was that it no longer has spellcasting ability, at least as a default. Of course, this doesn't mean we have to abandon this aspect of the Pathfinder First Edition ranger forever. Because of the way classes are now structured, it would be easy to create a spellcasting build of the ranger later using Spell Points (like the paladin), but for the Playtest, we are trying out a a spell-less ranger.</p>

<p>But enough of what the ranger doesn't have. Let's take a look at what he does.</p>

<h2>Ranger Features</h2>
<p>First and foremost, the ranger is a hunter. In Pathfinder First Edition, you picked creature types or subtypes that you were skilled at hunting. There are few things more frustrating than playing a ranger who rarely&mdash;or worst of all, never&mdash;encounters their favored enemies. It also led to some players who tended to play in more human-centric campaigns picking the human subtype, even if their backgrounds may have pointed to better choices for favored enemies.</p>

<p>This time we made the ranger hunting ability a bit more flexible, based on some popular ideas from the guide archetype and the slayer's studied target. At 1st level, rangers gain the Hunt Target feature.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class = "stat-block-title">[[A]] Hunt Target</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">Ranger</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Requirements</b> You can see or hear the target.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">You designate a single creature within 100 feet as your target and focus your attacks against that creature. While hunting that creature, you gain benefits for focusing your attacks. As long as all your attacks in a round are against the target you're hunting, the multiple attack penalty you take on the second attack is -4 (-3 with an agile weapon) instead of -5, and -8 (-6 with an agile weapon) instead of -10 on the third and any further attacks in the round. You also ignore the penalty for making ranged attacks against the target you're hunting within your second range increment. You also gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception checks when you Seek your target and a +2 circumstance bonus to Survival checks when you Track your target.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">You can have only one creature designated as the target of your hunt at a time. If you use Hunt Target against a creature when you already have a creature designated, the prior creature loses the designation and the new target gains the designation. In any case, this designation lasts until your next daily preparation.</p>
</blockquote>

<div class = "blurb360"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20180702-Ranger.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20180702-Ranger_360.jpeg"></a>
<p><i>Illustration by Wayne Reynolds</i></p></div>

<p>There are many class feats and some higher-level abilities that augment the ranger's Hunt Target. For example, at 17th level, the masterful hunter feature decreases the ranger's multiple attack penalty to -3 (or -2 with agile weapon) with his second attack and -6 (or -4 with agile weapons) on his third or further attack, and he can ignore the penalty against the target of his hunt in the second or third range increment, assuming that he has at least master proficiency in the weapon he is. Speaking of which, like the fighter, the ranger gains weapon mastery for a group of weapons, though he gains it at 13th level instead of at 3rd level like the fighter. At 19th level, the ranger gains the swift target feature, which allows him to use Hunt Target as a free action triggered before he makes his first Strike each round, so he's never without a target to hunt! The specifics of the Hunt Target ability make the ranger excel at a variety of combat styles, especially his traditional two-weapon fighting (since you can decrease the multiple attack penalty with agile attacks to be incredibly small) and archery (since you eliminate some of the most common ranged increment penalties). Of course, a ranger with a less traditional style, like a greatsword with a reduced multiple attack penalty, works great too!</p>

<p>Other class features allow the ranger to stalk and avoid his foes. At 5th level, he gains trackless step. At 7th level, he gains evasion (followed by improved evasion at 15th level). He gains nature's edge at 9th level, which allows him to treat enemies in natural difficult terrain or in difficult terrain resulting from a snare (more on snares later!) as flat-footed. Come 11th level, he gains the wild stride feature, which allows him to ignore or minimize the effects of difficult terrain.</p>

<h2>Ranger Feats</h2>
<p>Class feats, of course, determine the flavor of individuals within a class, and the ranger is no different. Specific ranger feats allow him to gain an animal companion at the same progression as a druid's, though potentially with special benefits that only a ranger can obtain. Other feats will enable him to further focus on his weapon choice, including a whole string of feats that allow him to specialize in two-weapon fighting.</p>

<p>Some fun feats allow the ranger to use his knowledge and senses to aid his allies as well as himself. Here are a couple of my favorites.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class = "stat-block-title">Monster Hunter <span class = "stat-block-cr">Feat 1</span></p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">Ranger</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">When you critically succeed to identify a target you're hunting with Recall Knowledge, you (and your allies, if you tell them) gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your next attack roll against it, but not against other creatures of that species. The creature is bolstered.</p>

<p class = "stat-block-title">[[F]] Scout's Warning <span class = "stat-block-cr">Feat 4</span></p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">Ranger</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Trigger</b> You are about to roll Perception for initiative.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">You audibly or visually warn your allies of danger, granting them a +1 circumstance bonus to their initiative rolls.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Harkening back to the hunter's bond class feature in Pathfinder First Edition, these feats allow the ranger to support the rest of the group with increased flexibility in how he chooses to do so, and these are just a few. The ranger can expand on Monster Hunter to grant even more benefits with a successful Recall Knowledge and even share the benefits of Hunt Target with other PCs (pretty much any martial class will love this benefit). And while flanking-savvy fighters might be a rogue's traditional best friend, the 12th-level Distracting Shot feat allows the ranger who hits a target with two ranged attacks in the same turn to leave that critter flat-footed until the start of the ranger's next turn. This helps fast rogues bring the pain quickly and farther away from more heavily armored support.</p>

<p>Another group of feats allows you to create snares. (Told you I'd get to that!)</p>

<h2>Snares</h2>
<p>Like alchemy, the ability to create snares is granted by a general feat (Snare Crafting). And like alchemists, rangers have the potential to lift general snare crafting to greater heights.</p>

<p>What are snares? Well, they're small portable hazards, very similar to traps, which can be set up in a short period of time (usually 1 minute). While it's unlikely that you will set up a snare in the midst of combat, they are perfect tools to arrange a battleground to your advantage. For instance, remember the nature's edge class feature that allows you to treat enemies in difficult terrain as flat-footed? Here's the most basic snare that creates difficult terrain.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class = "stat-block-title">Slowing Snare <span class = "stat-block-cr">Snare 1</span></p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">Consumable, Mechanical, Snare, Trap</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Price</b> 2 gp</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">A square with this snare becomes difficult terrain when the first creature enters it, and then it is destroyed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Other snares set off alarms, trip, or deal damage to those entering the area of a snare. Grab some alchemical items, and you can deal even more damage with a snare.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class = "stat-block-title">Freezing Snare <span class = "stat-block-cr">Snare 8</span></p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">Cold, Consumable, Mechanical, Snare, Trap</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Price</b> 50 gp</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">You set a trio of liquid ice bombs to explode in unison when a creature enters the freezing snare's square. The target must attempt a DC 22 Reflexsave.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Success</b> The target takes 1d8 cold damage.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Critical Success</b> The target is unaffected.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Failure</b> The target takes 3d8 cold damage and is hampered 10 until the end of its next turn.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Critical Failure</b> The target takes 6d8 cold damage and is hampered 10 until the end of its next turn.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Craft Requirements</b> three vials of liquid ice</p>

<p>Ranger feats that deal with snares allow you to learn more of them as your Crafting rank increases, lets you set them up faster (even in the middle of combat), and increases snares' DCs to match your class DC. Always make sure that your allies know where you hid your snares, or no bonus to attack rolls or initiative that you grant them will make up for the damage and humiliation you might cause.</p>
