  >Pathfinder Adventure Card Game release, </a><a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/wrathOfTheRighteous\"\
  ><em>Wrath of the Righteous</em></a>. As usual, each character in the set will have\

  \ available in two packs: one containing the 7 characters from the <a href=\"/products/btpy9a46\"\
  ><em>Wrath of the Righteous Base Set</em></a>, and one containing the 4 characters\
  \ from the <a href=\"/products/btpy9a47\"><em>Character Add-On Deck</em></a>.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Speaking of the Base Set, here's your first look at the finished box,\
  \ which features an all-new cover painting by Wayne Reynolds.</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  \ trade show and received lots of raves!</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>On to the characters!</p>\
  \ \n    <h2>Base Set</h2> \n    <p><b>Alain</b><br> Alain the cavalier makes his\
  \ ACG debut in this set, and he comes to the party with a shocking lack of tragedy\
  \ in his backstory. Alain is an entitled scion of nobility who grew to manhood entirely\
  \ convinced of his own competence in all things. As a brash young man, Alain gathered\
  \ whatever funds and personal effects he could carry. He then declared himself a\
  \ sellsword, setting off for the \"crimson poetry of the fray.\" Today, whether\
  \ leading soldiers in a suicidal charge or booting serving girls out of his bed\
  \ in the morning, Alain cares little about the people around him. More than money,\
  \ love, or lust, Alain cares about his reputation. With every encounter, he strives\
  \ to increase his own legend, whether as a scoundrel or saint. Perhaps the only\
  \ creature he truly values is his horse, Donahan. Exceedingly well trained, and\
  \ having accompanied Alain for longer than any of his human compatriots, Donahan\
  \ represents everything Alain looks for in a partner: absolute loyalty, absolute\
  \ trust, and absolute obedience. Donahan is a new type of card called a cohort—\
  we'll explain how those work in an upcoming blog.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/Playmat-Alain_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p><b>Balazar</b><br> Summoner Balazar and his eidolon Padrig\
  \ make their debuts in Wrath of the Righteous. Balazar grew up in the magical academies\
  \ of Quantium in Nex after that region's Arclords stole him from his family. More\
  \ interested in pranks and anarchy than his studies, Balazar was inevitably expelled.\
  \ He set off on the road to Ecanus, a city infamous for its twisted magical experiments.\
  \ The masters of Ecanus sought one who could look into a rift known as the Void\
  \ Chasm and maintain his sanity. As they forced the gnome to stare into the Void,\
  \ he heard a voice. \"I will help you,\" it said in reassuring tones. \"Give me\
  \ form and allow me to leave this prison, and you and I will become as one.\" Balazar\
  \ imagined a huge snakelike creature with a beak, and Padrig took form. Now the\
  \ gnome and his strange companion wander the world, having fun and causing trouble\
  \ in equal measure. Like Alain's horse Donahan, Padrig is a cohort card.</p> \n\

  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p><b>Enora</b><br> Enora the halfling arcanist makes her\
  \ ACG debut in this set. She's motivated by a love of knowledge. Enora was a star\
  \ student at the Occularium, a child of two professors at the august center of arcane\
  \ learning. While performing field research in a half-flooded temple to Nethys,\
  \ the god of magic, Enora uncovered a stone tablet that radiated a magical aura\
  \ unlike anything she had ever encountered before. Touching her hand to the tablet\
  \ flooded Enora's mind with magical revelations, knowledge beyond her wildest dreams,\
  \ and a sense of a much vaster world of magical discovery than she had ever imagined.\
  \ Today, Enora travels the Inner Sea searching for knowledge, be it secular or religious\
  \ in nature.</p> \n    <p><b>Harsk</b><br> ACG fan-favorite Harsk returns for a\
  \ third time! Few things made young Harsk happier than crouching in a tree stand\
  \ in southeastern Varisia with his crossbow, listening to the wind through the forest\
  \ leaves and waiting for deer or larger prey to wander by. After the brutal slaughter\
  \ of his brother by giants, however, Harsk's view of his place in the world changed.\
  \ Now the dwarven ranger seeks to forever be the voice of justice in wild places,\
  \ preserving nature's balance and preventing the sacrifices of noble men like his\
  \ brother.</p> \n    <p><b>Imrijka</b><br> Imrijka the inquisitor makes her Adventure\
  \ Card Game debut in Wrath of the Righteous. Half-orc orphans aren't a common sight\
  \ in the church of Pharasma, goddess of fate and death, but Imrijka isn't a common\
  \ half-orc. She wears a mysterious disk that might hold the key to the truth of\
  \ her parentage. Taken in by the church's high exorcist and trained as an inquisitor,\
  \ Imrijka brings judgment to all who would violate the laws of life and death. Imrijka's\
  \ seen it all, and she faces the future with courage and faith.</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/Playmat-Imrijka_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p><b>Kyra</b><br> Kyra's third appearance in the Adventure\
  \ Card Game pits her against demons and heretics, but facing off against long odds\
  \ is nothing new to this cleric of Sarenrae. Kyra grew up in the shadow of one of\
  \ the Dawnflower's shrines. When bandits attacked her small town, Kyra watched as\
  \ the priestesses did their best to reason with them—and when that came to naught,\
  \ she decided to end them before they could do more damage. Unfortunately, the bandits\
  \ were too strong, and the village burned. Kyra was one of the few survivors. On\
  \ the smoking ruins of the shrine, she swore her life and sword arm to Sarenrae.\
  \ She pledged to protect those who could not protect themselves, vowing not to spare\
  \ the blade when the time for redemption passes.</p> \n    <p><b>Seelah</b><br>\
  \ Fans of the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/wrathOfTheRighteous\">RPG version\
  \ of the Wrath of the Righteous Adventure Path</a> will not be surprised to see\
  \ our iconic paladin Seelah make her second appearance here. Seelah first encountered\
  \ warriors in Iomedae's service in the town of Solku, where her family had fled\
  \ after witnessing horrible atrocities in the land of Geb. When a group of Iomedae's\
  \ knights arrived to defend Solku from marauding gnolls, Seelah was immediately\
  \ taken with their beautiful, shining armor. Within an hour, she had stolen a particularly\
  \ fine helm with a golden bird upon its brow. Days later, Seelah was wracked with\
  \ guilt and horror as she saw the paladin whose helm she had stolen struck down\
  \ by a blow to the head from a gnoll's flail. As penance, Seelah joined the knights\
  \ of Iomedae, hoping to carry on the good work that the fallen paladin might have\
  \ done. You'll note that one of Seelah's powers mentions the new Corrupted trait—\
  we'll talk about that in an upcoming blog too!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <h2>Character Add-On Deck</h2> \n    <p><b>Adowyn</b><br>\
  \ Adowyn the hunter and her wolf Leryn make their first appearance in Wrath of the\
  \ Righteous. As a girl, Adowyn accompanied her father into the perilous Fangwood\
  \ on a trading expedition. One night a diseased bear charged into their camp, savaging\
  \ Adowyn's father before she could even cry out. Using the bow her father had carved\
  \ for her, she sank arrow after arrow into the beast, tears streaming down her cheeks.\
  \ At last, the bear fell. The creature was dead—but so was her father. Adowyn spent\
  \ months in the blighted forest alone, mourning her father and learning to survive\
  \ by wit and arrow. During her isolation, she rescued a lean gray wolf and nursed\
  \ it back to health, giving it her father's name as a last measure of grief and\
  \ farewell. Now Adowyn and Leryn wander the Inner Sea region as bounty hunters,\
  \ searching fruitlessly for the mother she left behind. Leryn is a cohort card in\
  \ Wrath.</p> \n    <p><b>Crowe</b><br> The Shoanti bloodrager Crowe debuts in Wrath\
  \ of the Righteous. Crowe was born under an auspicious sign during a thunderstorm\
  \ that scoured the Storval Plateau one burning autumn evening. As a youth, Crowe\
  \ often got into fights and then claimed he didn't remember how the scraps had started.\
  \ He would feel his heart beating against his ribs. He would hear the blood thrumming\
  \ in his ears, and that would be the last thing he recalled. After these amnesiac\
  \ rages took the lives of a dozen horses and several of his tribe members one night,\
  \ Crowe set out on his own with only his rage, his shame, and the power of the storm\
  \ that coursed through his blood to help him make his way.</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p><b>Seoni</b><br> Back by popular demand, Seoni makes\
  \ her third appearance in this set. The tattooed sorceress has long wandered the\
  \ world, though her goals remain a mystery. Seoni's runic tattoos play an influential\
  \ role in her personality. Coming from a culture where tattoo magic maintains a\
  \ strong following, hers are simultaneously a manifestation of her power and a tool\
  \ to aid in her castings. The sheer number adorning her skin, as well as the similar\
  \ patterns woven into her clothes, are a mark of status among her tribe, although\
  \ many of the so-called \"civilized\" residents of Varisia look upon such body modification\
  \ with distaste.</p> \n    <p><b>Shardra</b><br> Dwarven shaman Shardra Geltl makes\
  \ her Adventure Card Game debut here. As she grew into adolescence, Shardra discovered\
  \ that objects could speak to her. The voices of stone and wood kept her company\
  \ when her outward existence became fraught. They taught her much about the stories\
  \ and histories of her people. A fall while out walking brought Shardra into an\
  \ ancient cavern. Her journey into that holy place began her lifelong friendship\
  \ with a spirit creature resembling a tuatara, whom she named Kolo. With Kolo the\
  \ crag tuatara at her shoulder, Shardra now wanders the world, uncovering lost treasure\
  \ and listening to the tales it has to tell. Kolo is a cohort card in Wrath.</p>\
