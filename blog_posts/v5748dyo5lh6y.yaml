  articleBody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Paizo and <a href=\"http://drivethrucards.com\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">DriveThruCards</a> have been cooking up a couple of delicacies\
  \ for the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame\">Adventure Card Game</a> connoisseur.\
  \ Steve Wieck of DriveThruCards has details below!</p> \n    <h2>Card Creator</h2>\
  \ \n    <p>Paizo and DriveThruCards are delighted to announce their partnership\
  \ and today's release of the <a href=\"http://drivethrucards.com/PACG\" target=\"\
  _blank\">Pathfinder Adventure Card Game Community Card Creator</a>. That's quite\
  \ a mouthful isn't it? Even making it an acronym, PACGCCC, isn't much better. Let's\
  \ call it the Card Creator.</p> \n    <p>So what is the Card Creator? It's a web\
  \ application at DriveThruCards that lets you create, print, and share your own\
  \ cards ideas for PACG. <a href=\"http://drivethrucards.com/PACG\" target=\"_blank\"\
  >You can check it out here!</a></p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\

  \ src=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20150225-CardCreator_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>The Card Creator allows you to:</p> \n    <ul>\n    \
  \ <li>Create your own cards</li> \n     <li>Purchase your created cards in print\
  \ for $0.50/card.</li> \n     <li>Keep your card private.</li> \n     <li>List your\
  \ card publicly on DriveThruCards, allowing other PACG fans to see your card, comment\
  \ on it, and purchase it.</li>\n    </ul> \n    <p>Using the creator is easy. Just\
  \ choose your card type, and then upload some card art.</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  ><img src=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20150225-CardArt_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>We've worked with Fiery Dragon Productions and Fat Goblin\
  \ Games to make an array of stock art available to you as a micro-license for $0.40.\
  \ You can also upload your own art or public domain art. Then create your card text\
  \ and attributes before finalizing the card.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ><img src=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20150225-CardText_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>We've gone to Herculean effort to match the card backs\
  \ as closely as possible to the <a href=\"/products/btpy92zj\"><em>Skull &amp; Shackles</em></a>\
  \ cards, so that cards you create and print can be shuffled in seamlessly with your\
  \ existing cards. To avoid any confusion, though, all community created cards are\
  \ clearly indicated as such. The traditional expansion icon in the upper left corner\
  \ of the card is replaced with a Community Created Card logo.</p> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20150225-CommunityLogo.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20150225-CommunityLogo_360.jpeg\"\

  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>This clearly differentiates the official cards designed\
  \ by Mike Selinker and the card game team from the unofficial cards designed by\
  \ the community. Speaking of Mike Selinker, now might be a great time to review\
  \ Mike's post that offers a <a href=\"/threads/rzs2r6ax\">guidelines on creating\
  \ PACG cards</a>.</p> \n    <p>Then, please come and <a href=\"http://drivethrucards.com/PACG\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">give the card creator a try</a> or <a href=\"http://www.drivethrucards.com/browse.php?cPath=10442_21393\"\
  \ target=\"target = \" _blank>check out the cards the community is already creating</a>\
  \ with this new tool!</p> \n    <h2>Errata Decks</h2> \n    <p>Today we're also\
  \ releasing errata decks on DriveThruCards for any PACG fan who wants to play with\
  \ fully corrected <a href=\"/products/btpy951a\"><em>Rise of the Runelords</em></a>\
  \ cards. There are a few different errata decks, and you'll want to check the printing\
  \ of your cards to know which errata deck is for you. The first <em>Runelords</em>\
  \ printing was manufactured in China and the second was done in the USA. The card\
  \ backs produced by each printer vary a bit in color, so to have errata cards most\
  \ closely match your existing cards, you should get the errata decks customized\
  \ for your printing. Not sure if you have a first printing or second printing? Check\
  \ the fine print on the back of your box. The first printing will read, \"Printed\
  \ in China\" and the second will say, \"Printed in the USA.\"</p> \n    <p>Naturally,\
  \ there are more errata cards for the first printing, as many cards were corrected\
  \ in the second printing. The first printing errata cards are available in three\
  \ separate decks or as one bundle of all the cards. The second printing errata cards\
  \ come all in one deck.</p> \n    <ul> \n     <li><a href=\"http://drivethrucards.com/product/138468/Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Complete-Errata-Set-RoR-1st-printing\"\

  \    </ul> \n    <p>Tanis would like to add that the <a href=\"pfsacg\">Adventure\
  \ Card Guild</a> cards created exclusively for the Season of the Shackles will soon\
  \ be uploaded to the Card Creator, so you can play your way through that story without\
  \ proxies.</p> \n    <p>We hope you enjoy using the Card Creator and updating your\
  \ <em>Rise of the Runelords</em> collection with the Errata Decks!</p> \n    <p>Steve\
