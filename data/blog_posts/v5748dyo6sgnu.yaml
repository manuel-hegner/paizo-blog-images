  \     </div> \n     <p>\"Pardon...\"</p> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Over\
  \ the din of the bustling street market the young boy's cry reached the passing\
  \ nobleman. \"Pardon me, my lord. Are you seeking the god rock? Do you need the\
  \ courage to take the leap? The blessing of one who passed the test?\"</p> \n  \
  \   <p>The nobleman ignored him, but the young merchant persisted, obviously recognizing\
  \ the robed figure's wealth from the quality of his clothes and the confidence in\
  \ his step. \"I have here the tears of Iomedae herself, shed when she learned of\
  \ Aroden's death!\" The boy pushed through the crowd, following the nobleman, waving\
  \ a tiny vial that undoubtedly contained ordinary water. \"My lord?\"</p> \n   \
  \  <p>The nobleman paid the boy no mind and walked through the throng seemingly\
  \ oblivious to the solicitations of its eager vendors.</p> \n     <p>All along the\
  \ Avenue of the Hopeful it was the same racket. Everyone had some divine relic to\
  \ sell: a tabard supposedly worn by Iomedae in the Shining Crusade; a barroom dart\
  \ thrown by a mortal Cayden Cailean; a blood-rusted dagger said to have been wielded\
  \ by Norgorber himself. They were all fake, of course, but the visitors that streamed\
  \ down this road every day to look at the Starstone Cathedral didn't know that—\
  or pretended not to out of willful ignorance. Sometimes even the merchants believed\
  \ the veracity of their claims, their fraud offset by their misplaced good intentions.</p>\

  ></a> \n      <p>Illustration by Federico Musetti</p>\n     </div> \n     <p>Among\
  \ themselves, the charlatans hocking these wares claim the cathedral is the straight\
  \ man in their cons. Its very presence adds an air of mystery and divine authority\
  \ to the propositions, no matter how obvious the counterfeit relics are. How could\
  \ it not? Inside the towering ancient shrine, suspended in the center of an unfathomably\
  \ deep pit, lay a chunk of rock that fell from the heavens millennia ago amid the\
  \ untold devastation of Earthfall. Those who brave the cathedral, passing all of\
  \ its cunning tests, defeating its deadly guardians, and surviving to touch the\
  \ Starstone exit the cathedral as gods. Many have tried over the centuries since\
  \ Aroden constructed the cathedral to protect the holy relic within, but only three\
  \ have ever succeeded. Unsurprisingly, it is Absalom's most visited tourist spot—\
  the epicenter of the City at the Center of the World.</p> \n     <p>\"Just two silver\
  \ weights!\"</p> \n     <p>The nobleman was now so far from the desperate tear-merchant\
  \ that the boy's last cries were all but lost to the sounds of the city. The kid\
  \ was new to the street and if he didn't soon fall in with one of the many organized\
  \ rings of counterfeiters and con artists who worked in tandem to move their merchandise,\
  \ he'd undoubtedly end up like so many others in the Ascendant Court, picking pockets\
  \ to turn a profit from even the most discerning of customers. Those with experience\
  \ working the God's Market knew not to waste their time with this particular nobleman,\
  \ either as a customer or a mark.</p> \n     <p>Lord Synarr arrived in the city\
  \ only six months ago, and since then he has walked the avenue every morning to\
  \ gaze upon the Starstone Cathedral. At first, he was swarmed by kids hawking sacred\
  \ items and protective talismans, but over time, they learned not to bother. Lord\
  \ Synarr never spared even a single copper for any of their wares, he never once\
  \ inspected their goods. He only diverted his attention from the Starstone Cathedral\
  \ at the end of the Avenue of Hopefuls for the hopefuls themselves—those adventurers,\
  \ demagogues, and zealots ambitious (or foolhardy) enough to plan their own run\
  \ on divinity.</p> \n     <p>In a bid to prove their worthiness, most set up in\
  \ one of the God's Market's many empty stalls and proselytize to what small audience\
  \ they can wrest away from their competition. Some preach a message that speaks\
  \ to a particular listener, or are charismatic enough to enthrall the crowd with\
  \ their pageantry, and convert real followers from among the masses. On any given\
  \ day a half-dozen or more hopefuls line the avenue, preaching their new faith,\
  \ offering indulgences for coin, or performing rituals to prepare themselves for\
  \ their journey.</p> \n     <p>For his first few weeks in Absalom, Lord Synarr stopped\
  \ at each one as he made his way down the avenue, listening to the articles of the\
  \ hopefuls' soon-to-be faiths before stoically moving on. The enigmatic noble no\
  \ longer tarries before such aspirants, but he listens carefully to their tirades\
  \ as he walks past, sometimes even smiling smugly to himself when a hopeful exhibits\
  \ particular skill at capturing the crowd's attention.</p> \n     <p>Today, Lord\
  \ Synarr witnessed a Keleshite trade prince offering a golden scabbard to Golinarth,\
  \ the hulking hopeful who always wears a wooden skeleton mask and claims to have\
  \ come back from the dead to become the god of second chances—one more rube offering\
  \ wealth for miracles that would never materialize. A few yards further down the\
  \ avenue, Ryni the Jest, a prankster hoping to become a god of mirth, gave the stern\
  \ noble an unreciprocated wink of acknowledgment before turning his attention back\
  \ to the butt of his public ridicule. The lord had his suspicions that the clown\
  \ never actually intended to attempt the Test of the Starstone, but was simply amassing\
  \ followers to start his own cult of personality.</p> \n     <p>A half-orc woman\
  \ with a lilting accent offered Lord Synarr a score of rings, pendants, and bracelets\
  \ tied to a velvet pillow. \"Welcome back, my lord. Taking the test today?\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The noble didn't flinch, continuing his leisurely stroll toward the\
  \ cathedral without a second glance in the merchant's direction.</p> \n     <p>\"\
  I got a new one, I did. Lets you walk on air.\" Her arm shot toward the end of the\
  \ avenue like an arrow loosed from a hunter's bow. \"Fttt—straight over the pit!\"\
  \ Recognizing that her daily pitch to her regular \"customer\" would have the same\
  \ results today as it had the last six months, she turned her attention seamlessly\
  \ to a wide-eyed gnome wearing Mwangi fashion to Synarr's left. \"How about you,\
  \ chum?\"</p> \n     <p>Lord Synarr doubted any of the woman's jewelry was even\
  \ magical, much less powerful enough to help someone cross the yawning expanse that\
  \ separated the Starstone Cathedral from the surrounding city. Some fool, he was\
  \ sure, would slip the ring on and dive headfirst into the abyss, cursing the merchant\
  \ the whole way down. His dark eyes twinkled at the thought. One more shrine for\
  \ the cathedral of the Failed, if even that.</p> \n     <p>Finally arriving at the\
  \ edge of the chasm, Lord Synarr stopped for a moment and looked at the ancient\
  \ temple. He was not the only one to hesitate near the precipice, and he had noted\
  \ other regulars with their own routines in his time performing this daily ritual.\
  \ Very few of them had lasted longer than a month or two, either giving up on their\
  \ hopes of godhood or having perished in the attempt. Lord Synarr would be neither\
  \ distracted nor a failure; he had one shot, and he would only attempt it when the\
  \ time was right.</p> \n     <p>The robed lord turned to the left and walked around\
  \ the chasm, the same route he took every day.</p> \n     <p>As he walked, his gait\
  \ embodying both purpose and tranquility, Lord Synarr's thoughts turned to the temples\
  \ adorning the grand plaza surrounding the pit. Iomedae and Cayden Cailean, two\
  \ of the four whose apotheosis occurred mere yards away, had monuments here, built\
  \ by their faithful as testaments to their success. A bridge spanned the chasm between\
  \ each temple and the Starstone Cathedral, a physical manifestation of the gods'\
  \ connection to the Starstone through which they attained divinity. The ascended\
  \ god Norgorber, second after Aroden to pass the test, was far too secretive to\
  \ put his temple out in the open. Those, like Lord Synarr, who studied the Starstone\
  \ Cathedral could guess in which direction Norgorber's temple lied from the alignment\
  \ of the third bridge, which appeared to point toward nothing in particular.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Lord Synarr ended his circuit of the Ascendant Court each day before\
  \ the ruined fourth bridge across the mighty chasm. The missing span once pointed\
  \ to the city's great temple to Aroden, who had raised the Starstone from the ocean\
  \ depths along with the entire Isle of Kortos and in so doing captured his own spark\
  \ of divinity. Though the bridge and even Aroden himself are gone, the temple still\
  \ stands, now serving as the Chelish embassy. Despite the addition of the infernal\
  \ insignias of House Thrune, Lord Synarr could still make out symbol of Aroden's\
  \ eye that was once emblazoned above the grand entry, a negative outline in old\
  \ dirt and moss.</p> \n     <p>The noble ended his daily stroll here to remind himself\
  \ of his own mortality. While Lord Synarr welcomed the dignity and experience the\
  \ gray in his hair and the lines at the corners of his eyes indicated, he could\
  \ too easily allow the comforts afforded by his vast wealth distract him from the\
  \ unwelcome truth that unless he passed the Test of the Starstone, he too would\
  \ die. Though Aroden, god of humanity, may have died, Lord Synarr would not, he\
  \ told himself.</p> \n     <p>His gaze turned from the repurposed Arodenite temple\
  \ toward the towering cathedral at the city's heart. From this vantage point, he\
  \ didn't see the gulf separating him from the home of divinity, and the sights and\
  \ sounds of the bustling metropolis fell away. With the focus of an owl trained\
  \ on its unsuspecting prey, he was aware only of the Starstone Cathedral and the\
  \ power within. And just like every other day, he said one word, quietly to himself,\
  \ before turning and walking back to his stately manor and the day's extravagances.</p>\
