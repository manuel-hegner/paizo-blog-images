  > \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">I'm a huge fan of audiobooks, so you can imagine\
  \ my excitement as both an author and an editor to say the following words:</p>\
  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><a href=\"http://audible.com/pathfinder\" target=\"\
  _blank\"><b><i>Paizo and Audible have partnered to release the entire Pathfinder\
  \ Tales novel line as audiobooks—and the first wave is available now!</i></b></a></p>\
  \ \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Along with Publisher Erik Mona and various other\
  \ staff members, I've been working on this deal for more than a year, and it's been\
  \ torture keeping it secret. We've just released slightly over half of the <a href=\"\
  /pathfindertales\">Pathfinder Tales</a> backlist, with the rest releasing in mid-January.\
  \ And of course, Tor/Macmillan will continue to produce new audiobooks as they come\
  \ out. Which means that very soon, every Pathfinder novel ever released will be\
  \ in audiobook form! You can find all 17 books currently available and listen to\
  \ samples at <a href=\"http://audible.com/pathfinder\" target=\"_blank\">audible.com/pathfinder</a>.</p>\

  ></a> <a href=\"/products/btpy90py\"><img src=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/product/catalog/PZO/PZO8516_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> <i>These awesome stories and more of our Pathfinder Tales novels\
  \ are now available through Audible!</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>One of the best things\
  \ about the way Audible has approached these books is the amazing team of narrators\
  \ they've assembled. For the last several months, my phone's been ringing day, night,\
  \ and weekends as the narrators make sure they get pronunciations right for every\
  \ character, city, and monster. (I actually spent a whole layover on the flight\
  \ home from Gen Con sitting in an airport carefully speaking monster names into\
  \ my phone—I'm sure the folks sitting near me thought I was summoning a demon via\
  \ teleconference.) Not only is it fun to have a huge range of voices reading the\
  \ books, but it's gratifying to see the narrators equally passionate about the work—\
  not only are they all skilled voice artists, but some were already playing Pathfinder!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Yet that's not the only announcement I've been dying to make. While I\
  \ mentioned it a bit on social media when it first went live, <b><i>all of the Pathfinder\
  \ Tales novels are now available on Kindle</i></b> through Amazon. It's something\
  \ I've been working on since literally before the first novel released, and I'm\
  \ thrilled that our relationship with Tor has allowed us to finally get every Pathfinder\
  \ Tales novel released in all the major formats—including the biggest contender\
  \ in the ring.</p> \n    <p>It's a proud day for Pathfinder Tales. So whether you\
  \ prefer to read in hard copy, on an e-reader, or while driving to work*, I hope\
  \ you check out the novels!</p> \n    <p>James L. Sutter<br> <i>Executive Editor</i></p>\
  \ \n    <p class=\"tiny\">* Actually, that last one only applies if you're reading\
  \ via audiobook—otherwise you should probably keep your eyes on the road.</p> \n\
