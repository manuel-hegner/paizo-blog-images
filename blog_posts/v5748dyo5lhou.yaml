  \ shreds of meat off what appears to be a thighbone. He occasionally feeds a morsel\
  \ to the Magic Bird sitting on his shoulder.</i></p> \n     <p><b>Ranzak (humming):</b>\
  \ ...come on pirates, do your duty. Ranzak's ready for some booty!</p> \n     <p><i>Ranzak\
  \ snickers. Ekkie enters, skipping and swinging a dogslicer in a wide circle as\
  \ she moves. Ekkie's brother's skull, Plarg, is wedged under one of her arms.</i></p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>Ekkie:</b> Hiya, Ranzak! Whatchu' eatin'?</p> \n     <p><b>Ranzak:</b>\
  \ Bits of tiny flapping demon. Longshanks say \"imp.\" Imp imp imp. Good with sauce.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>Ekkie:</b> Everything better with sauce!</p> \n     <p><b>Ranzak:</b>\
  \ What we do today, Ekkie?</p> \n     <p><b>Ekkie:</b> Ekkie think we talk about\
  \ how great goblins is.</p> \n     <p><b>Ranzak:</b> Good way to start most days.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>Plarg:</b> ...</p> \n     <p><b>Ekkie:</b> Good point, Plarg. Whole\
  \ world should know why goblins is best adventurer party.</p> \n     <p><b>Ranzak:</b>\
  \ Especially when goblins find big dumb longshanks to stand near! 'Specially with\
  \ big longshanks to stand behind!</p> \n     <p><b>Ekkie:</b> Yes, is best for longshanks—\
  I calls 'em shields of meat or \"pre-dinners\"—to think they is in charge and is\
  \ being nice to goblins, protecting goblins from mean old monsters. Best longshanks\
  \ for this is called pal-a-dims. Meat shield stand in front while goblins sneak\
  \ around back, taking all the stuff.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n  \

  ></a> \n     </div> \n     <p><b>Ranzak:</b> When adventurer party is ALL goblins,\
  \ sometimes things can be slow, because all goblins want stuff, but not all goblins\
  \ want to stand in front. Better with paladims.</p> \n     <p><b>Ekkie:</b> Ekkie\
  \ see how Ranzak steals stuff real good then sneaks ahead to steal more stuff when\
  \ he find good stuff. This good plan, but Ranzak gots to stay sorta close to the\
  \ paladims in case a bigbad comes.</p> \n     <p><b>Ranzak (looking around frantically,\
  \ prepared to hide):</b> <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130222-Reta.jpg\"\
  >Reta?</a> Where?!</p> \n     <p><b>Ekkie (sighing and bopping Ranzak on the head):</b>\
  \ She not here, dummy. Ekkie means big, nasty ol' monster.</p> \n     <p><b>Magic\
  \ Bird:</b> SQUAWK!</p> \n     <p><b>Ekkie:</b> Exactly.</p> \n     <p><b>Ranzak:</b>\
  \ Ranzak see how Ekkie fight rats and cats and snakes real good by herself and scares\
  \ bigbads away so they goes and fights at other places. That smart!</p> \n     <p><b>Ekkie:</b>\
  \ So together, Ekkie and Ranzak make bigbads run away to other places, and take\
  \ all the stuff. Ekkie's pretty sure that's what it say in longshanks book under\
  \ picture of \"adventurer.\"</p> \n     <p><b>Ranzak:</b> Eww, books!</p> \n   \
  \  <p><b>Ekkie:</b> Sometimes books are mixed in with stuff to steal. Longshanks\
  \ trade books for meat; Ekkie learn this when she in Big-Time Thief Guild. That\
  \ also where she learn to speak with semicolons.</p> \n     <p><b>Plarg:</b> ...</p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>Ekkie:</b> Good point, Plarg.</p> \n     <p><b>Magic Bird:</b> SQUAWK!</p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>Ranzak (laughing):</b> Truth, Magic Bird.</p> \n     <p><b>Ekkie:</b>\
  \ Hmm, with Ekkie and Ranzak, you get four adventurers for price of two!</p> \n\
  \     <p><b>Ranzak:</b> That good bargain!</p> \n     <p><i>Ekkie and Ranzak stare\
  \ out into space for a beat.</i></p> \n     <p><b>Ekkie:</b> World should also know\
  \ that because of stuff-stealing and bigbad-scaring, goblins search places really\
  \ fast. Fastest of all adventurers!</p> \n     <p><b>Ranzak:</b> And goblins maybe\
  \ not good at clearing out all places, like temples or magic places, but good at\
  \ most.</p> \n     <p><b>Ekkie:</b> And when time comes to fight biggest bad, Ekkie\
  \ turns to devoted paladim friend and cheers. While going through pockets for loose\
  \ stuff.</p> \n     <p><b>Ranzak:</b> So, in end, is clear that goblins is best\
  \ characters ever. Accept no substitutes.</p> \n     <p><b>Ekkie:</b> What's a character?</p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>Plarg:</b> ...</p> \n     <p><b>Magic Bird:</b> SQUAWK!</p> \n  \
