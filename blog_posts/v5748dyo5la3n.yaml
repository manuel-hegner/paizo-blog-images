  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, November 27, 2007</p> \n   <p>The fey of Darkmoon\
  \ Vale were not always evil. For decades they lived and played under the spreading\
  \ branches of the forest, content to remain close to the land that sustained them.\
  \ But recently, things have changed within the forest. The establishment of the\
  \ lumber mill in Falcon's Hollow has given rise to a veritable army of woodsmen\
  \ bent on leveling the forest and plundering its wealth of darkwood. Hunters and\
  \ trappers have descended into the forest, seeking furs and trophies to take back\
  \ to the markets of Andoran. Slowly but surely, the creatures within the forest\
  \ began to change. Anger and fear replaced the capricious playfulness of its fey\
  \ guardians, and the icy grip of hate descended on the land. Far away, in her frozen\
  \ palace in Irrisen, the Witch Queen sensed opportunity, and dispatched a cold rider\
  \ to Darkmoon Vale.</p> \n   <p>With the first breath of winter's frost he arrived\
  \ in the forest, and as ice and snow descended upon the land, his corrupting presence\
  \ wormed its way into the hearts of the fey, transforming them into creatures of\
  \ nightmare. </p> \n   <p>In <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7x86\"><i>E1: Carnival of\
  \ Tears</i></a>, the PCs must face off against this implacable foe who seeks to\
  \ drive the humans from Falcon's Hollow, and in so doing, gain an unbreakable hold\
  \ over the fey creatures that live there. Cold Riders are terrifying armored majesties,\
  \ clad in sable cloaks of frost, a pair of almost ridiculously large crystal-blue\
  \ antlers cresting their dread helms of ice and steel. These dark monsters were\
  \ once princes of the forest. Brought living before the Witch Queen, she stole their\
  \ songs and their love of green and beauty and replaced them with cold hate. The\
  \ riders are her knights gallant and her favored minions in her war on the sun,\
  \ the green, and all things that recoil from her frigid touch. They delight in perversion,\
  \ slaughter, and the corruption of other fey. It is their solemn duty to bring fresh\
  \ souls and candidates for transformation into cold riders back to their queen's\
  \ court, and they relish this charge. The paired mini-whirlwinds of effervescent\
  \ frost swirling in their visors can chill the hearts of the most stalwart with\
  \ a frigid glance, and the vapor-fog floating from them often takes the shape of\
  \ their former fair features, screaming in silent agony and twisting into malformed\
  \ wisps in the rising wind. </p> \n   <p>Jeremy Walker <br>Assistant Editor, GameMastery</p>\
