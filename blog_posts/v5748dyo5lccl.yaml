  \ Society Organized Play, Part XVII: Use the Pathfinder Society's Resources To Do\
  \ Good in the World</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Monday, July 11, 2011</p> \n   <p><i>When\
  \ the existence of so many factions within the Pathfinder Society began to become\
  \ apparent, many were dismayed, especially those who took umbrage at the Society's\
  \ resources being used for ethically questionable purposes or personal gain. Unable\
  \ to eliminate such elements as the Shadow Lodge from the ranks of the organization,\
  \ an influential group of Pathfinder clerics, paladins, and servants of good-aligned\
  \ deities banded together to form their own faction—the Silver Crusade—as an answer\
  \ to these undesirable offshoots of the Society. While a crusade in name only, the\
  \ Silver Crusade models itself after the staunchly good silver dragon, making a\
  \ valiant effort to use the Society's influence, reach, and resources to do good\
  \ throughout the Inner Sea region and beyond.</i></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <div\

  \ \n   <p> If there's one thing the faction system has taught us since Pathfinder\
  \ Society Organized Play began just a little less than three years ago, it's that\
  \ players want to be good guys. Until now, that means most people have been playing\
  \ Andoren Pathfinders who fight against tyranny, oppression, and slavery. But what\
  \ about those paladins who don't want to be asked to act against the law or clerics\
  \ who are less concerned with politics than they are healing the sick and helping\
  \ the downtrodden?</p> \n   <p>The answer, of course, is the focus of this week's\
  \ blog, the fourth of five new factions and one I expect to be very popular among\
  \ players currently in Andoran only because of lack of other \"good\" options. This\
  \ faction is the Silver Crusade, led by Sarenite paladin Ollysta Zadrian, an ex-Pathfinder\
  \ with countless connections within the organization. While the faction's name may\
  \ bring to mind knights in shining armor and religious zealotry, it's less a traditional\
  \ campaign or holy war than a crusade of the mind and motivations—a group of like-minded\
  \ Pathfinders set on helping one another spread the word and good will of their\
  \ respective faiths wherever the Decemvirate may send them.</p> \n   <p>Continuing\
  \ our previews of Pathfinder Society tie-in content in the forthcoming <i>Pathfinder\
  \ Society Field Guide</i>, here's a look at one of the faction-specific prestige\
  \ awards members of the Silver Crusade can purchase with their Prestige Points once\
  \ they've earned enough Fame.</p> \n   <blockquote>\n    <b>Beacon of Good (Fame\
  \ 5, 2 PP)</b> The Shining Crusade gives you a <i>shining wayfinder</i> (see page\
  \ 55) emblazoned with the emblem of a silver dragon. If you lose your <i>shining\
  \ wayfinder</i>, you can purchase a new one for an additional 2 PP. Members of the\
  \ Silver Crusade who are caught selling <i>shining wayfinders</i> for their own\
  \ profit are exiled, and must switch factions.\n   </blockquote> \n   <p>Now I bet\
  \ you're wondering what a <i>shining wayfinder</i> is, right? It wouldn't be much\
  \ of a tease if I gave you everything, though, would it? Oh, okay. You've been patiently\
  \ reading these for 17 installments now, so I guess I can give a bit more: a <i>shining\
  \ wayfinder</i> functions like a normal <i>wayfinder</i>, but also lets the user\
  \ cast <i>detect evil</i> at will and <i>protection from evil</i> on herself once\
  \ per day.</p> \n   <p>That's all you get from me this week, though. No more. You're\
  \ just going to have to wait until next Monday for me to talk about the fifth and\
  \ final new faction: the Shadow Lodge! Have a good week, Pathfinders.</p> \n   <p>Mark\
