  \      <p id=\"entry1\"><b>1</b><br>\n       Pathfinder is known for its rich world,\
  \ full of storytelling potential, deep and meaningful character building, and a\
  \ tactical play experience, and with <em>Quest</em>, we can bring all of that to\
  \ a wider board game audience. So, while the game will feel immediately familiar\
  \ to fans of the RPG, we worked hard to ensure that the story and overall mechanics\
  \ of this game were approachable and easy to learn for new players as well.</p>\n\
  \      <p id=\"entry2\"><b>2</b><br>\n       One unexpectedly intricate challenge\
  \ was designing our set of 17 modular, double-sided map tiles so that they are interesting,\
  \ reusable in unique ways, line up nicely, and don’t take up too much table space.\
  \ And there was much triple- and quadruple-checking to make sure no single encounter\
  \ required you to use both sides of the same tile!</p>\n      <p id=\"entry3\"><b>3</b><br>\n\
  \       I can’t wait to hear stories from players about how their character builds,\
  \ along with the items they’ve found, challenges they’ve attempted, and tactics\
  \ they’ve used, have combined in truly unique ways to make for awesome gameplay\
  \ moments. Even when playtesting the same encounters over and over, we never saw\
  \ things play out the same way, and my favorite thing is watching players find clever\
  \ and unexpected synergies that emerge from a series of relatively simple choices.</p>\n\
  \      <p id=\"entry4\"><b>4</b><br>\n       Our primary goal while making <em>Quest</em>\
  \ was to shoot for as approachable an adventure board game as possible while giving\
  \ players the right amount of interesting decisions—not too few as to feel repetitive,\
  \ but not so many as to overwhelm—and also to make choices matter! You’ll find that\
  \ as you play out each encounter, each adventure, and indeed throughout the narrative\
  \ of the entire campaign, your group’s particular makeup and choices through the\
  \ story leads to their own unique tale.</p>\n      <p id=\"entry5\"><b>5</b><br><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Quest</em> is a cooperative fantasy adventure board game for 1 to 4 players. In\
  \ <em>Quest</em>, you will play through a series of adventures, each one consisting\
  \ of several encounters presented to you in the Adventure Book. Each encounter tells\
  \ you what challenges you might face, both while exploring the world and while in\
  \ combat. Challenges often require dice rolls to complete and depending on your\
  \ result, you will get sent to the Challenge Book to learn your fate!</p>\n    \
  \  <p>Throughout each adventure, you will be asked to make important choices that\
  \ shape the overall outcome of the story. At the end of each adventure, you will\
  \ level up and get ready to take on even more challenging foes and dangers in the\
  \ next adventure!</p>\n      <p>If you want to learn more, check out our <a href=\"\

  entry6\"><b>6</b><br>\n       Finding the right point of balance in a game like\
  \ this can be tremendously difficult, especially when each combat features new monsters\
  \ and characters frequently gain new items and abilities. While everybody wants\
  \ to win, we also want to ensure that the victory feels earned— through clever choices,\
  \ tactical teamwork, and a little bit of luck. Both the player and monster statistics\
  \ went through several rounds of revision and playtesting to ensure that we got\
  \ the sweet spot that we wanted. The fights are tough, but if you play smart and\
  \ work together, you should win the day.</p>\n      <p id=\"entry7\"><b>7</b><br>\n\
  \       This entry is not pointed to by anything, so if you're reading it, you must\
  \ love secrets—that's great! We crammed <em>Pathfinder Quest</em> full of little\
  \ surprises, whether it's the achievements you can check off (eventually unlocking\
  \ a unique item), special uses for your character’s background or class abilities,\
  \ lots of narrative twists and turns, and maybe even a secret passage. Oh, and when\
  \ we say you shouldn't look through the item deck? You really shouldn't...</p>\n\
