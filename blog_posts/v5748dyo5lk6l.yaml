  \ I get to tell you about the most fun I've had designing the Pathfinder Adventure\
  \ Card Game. It's time to talk about the <i><a href=\"/products/btpy9s2o\">Hell's\
  \ Vengeance Character Deck 1</a></i>, the first half of the two-part evil block\
  \ in the PACG line.</p> \n    <p>When we first thought of adapting the <a href=\"\
  /pathfinder/adventurePath/hellsVengeance\">Hell's Vengeance Adventure Path</a>,\
  \ we knew we couldn't resist some of our darker impulses. These guys work well in\
  \ groups, but not in a way that benefits everyone equally. Playing them takes some\
  \ selfishness.</p> \n    <p>The first trio of these rotters is the more martial\
  \ half of the team; we saved the sneakier folks for the <a href=\"/products/btpy9sjy\"\
  >next deck</a>. First up, the interrogator extraordinaire, Linxia the Hellknight.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6823-LinxiaTokenFront.jpg\"\

  ></a> \n     <p>So many spikes!</p>\n    </div> \n    <p>I don't think we've made\
  \ a character more lawful than Linxia. She demands order, and not the for-the-good-of-all\
  \ kind. Take a look at that last power on Knight of the Rack. It sounds good, right?\
  \ A character can banish a boon to add a turn to the scenario—but wait, it's a boon\
  \ of the character's favored card type. The stuff you like. Linxia is going to be\
  \ saying \"You don't <i>really</i> need that\" a lot, and you will find yourself\
  \ agreeing with her.</p> \n    <p>And that second checkbox on the Knight of the\
  \ Rack's second power! It's <i>totally</i> like healing. When James Ernest and I\
  \ went to a Vegas time-share presentation, we had a sleazy agent who said things\
  \ like \"It's like taking money from this pocket and putting it into that pocket!\
  \ Except this pocket is in <i>my</i> pants.\" Linxia's like that. She's the first\
  \ character I can remember who heals you for your own <i>bad</i>.</p> \n    <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6823-UrgrazTokenFront.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6823-UrgrazTokenFront_180.jpeg\"></a>\

  ></a> \n     <p>I think he sharpens his beard.</p>\n    </div> \n    <p>The Antipaladin\
  \ Urgraz has a phrase we've used exactly once on a character before: \"increase\
  \ the damage.\" When we gave it to the <a href=\"/products/btpy9k5m\"><em>Goblins\
  \ Burn! Class Deck</em></a>'s Zibini, we didn't expect our playtesters to take it.\
  \ They took it. A lot. But that was on a checkboxed power on a role. This is on\
  \ the main power on the character card. Along with a handy ability to discard cards\
  \ from other players' decks.</p> \n    <p>Then when Urgraz gets into his roles,\
  \ it gets even more colorful. You can redirect that damage you'd suffer from failing\
  \ a check to someone else. You can take cards other people bury and put them in\
  \ your hand. Now, of course, you should really give those back afterward.</p> \n\
  \    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6823-LazzeroTokenFront.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6823-LazzeroTokenFront_180.jpeg\"></a>\

  ></a> \n     <p>At least the hat is nice.</p>\n    </div> \n    <p>The Cleric Lazzero\
  \ has his own painful sort of healing. And he does some magnificent things with\
  \ blessings of a particular evil type. Good news: Quite a few of the blessings in\
  \ here are Corrupted. But the even better news is that power which says \"You may\
  \ ignore the Corrupted trait on a blessing you play on your (□ or any) check.\"\
  \ That sounds great, right?</p> \n    <p>Hey, let's just check the rules on that.\
  \ The Golden Rule says \"If a card tells you to ignore something, the thing you're\
  \ ignoring never has any effect <i>on you</i>.\" Those last two words are really\
  \ important. Because Lazzero's happy to give you that d12 on whatever you're doing.\
  \ But you sadly don't have his ability to ignore the Corrupted trait. And so this\
  \ stuff happens.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6823-BlessingOfMephistopheles.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6823-BlessingOfMephistopheles_180.jpeg\"\

  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6823-Jheraal_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n     <p>Does Mephistopheles really \"bless\" people?</p>\n    </div> \n\
  \    <p>That doesn't sound so fun if you're the beneficiary of Lazzero's largesse,\
  \ but to Lazzero it sounds great! All the major devils get new Corrupted blessings.\
  \ Some of them do great things at a price. If you're Urgraz, it might be a price\
  \ <i>other</i> people pay.</p> \n    <p>The spells in this deck do some things we\
  \ haven't had spells do before; that theme is followed through in a big way in the\
  \ next deck. The allies have a nice evil feel too: some imps and devils, a few hellknights,\
  \ and even a Redeemer Blacksmith to temper what I'm about to show you.</p> \n  \
  \  <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6823-Bloodblade.jpg\"\

  ></a> \n     <p>I feel dirty already.</p>\n    </div> \n    <p>Here's my favorite\
  \ thing about this deck: It comes with its own redemption card, similar to the one\
  \ in the <a href=\"/products/btpy9a46\"><em>Wrath of the Righteous Base Set</em></a>.\
  \ If you have it, you can redeem the boons when you play Wrath, or via methods such\
  \ as banishing that Asmodean Disciplines. (You can even banish that book to redeem\
  \ itself.)</p> \n    <p>And oh, the things you get to do. Banish allies you encounter\
  \ to heal yourself. Grab monsters and turn them into fireballs. Deal damage to other\
  \ characters to reduce damage dealt to you. All the things an evil person would\
  \ want to do, and feel good doing it.</p> \n    <p>Sound like fun? Trust me, it\
  \ is. And wait till you see Deck 2!</p> \n    <p>Mike Selinker<br> <i>Adventure\
