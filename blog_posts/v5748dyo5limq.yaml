  \ law and order at any cost. For devil-blooded Jheraal, a veteran Hellknight investigator,\
  \ even the harshest methods are justified if it means building a better world for\
  \ her daughter. Yet things get personal when a serial killer starts targeting hellspawn\
  \ like Jheraal and her child, somehow magically removing their hearts and trapping\

  \ The Scholar's Murder<br> <i>Jheraal</i></h2> \n     <p>Birds cared nothing for\
  \ murder.</p> \n     <p>Sweetly they sang from the branches of the fig and lemon\
  \ trees that wreathed the grounds of Vaneo Celverian, the city manor of proud, ancient\
  \ House Celverian. Under the elegant tile roofs and gilded balustrades, all might\
  \ be in panic, but nothing disturbed the birds among their sun-dappled leaves. They\
  \ sang and sang, bright as joy, while down below, mortal men and women struggled\
  \ to grasp the enormity of loss.</p> \n     <p>They'd suffered a staggering one,\
  \ Jheraal knew. Master Othando Celverian, second and favored son of Lord Abello\
  \ Celverian, heir to his house and hope of his family's future, had been murdered\
  \ in the night. Others had been killed, too, but in Cheliax, only one of those deaths\
  \ really mattered.</p> \n     <p>Out on the grand lawn, a semicircle of maids, grooms,\
  \ cooks, and washerwomen in white and gold-slashed blue stood where they'd been\
  \ turned out for her inspection. Every one of House Celverian's servants was a picture\
  \ of shock and grief. The younger maids held handkerchiefs to their tear-puffed\
  \ eyes, while the older servants muttered about what they'd do when they found their\
  \ master's killer.</p> \n     <p>Both the sobbing and the plotting died abruptly\
  \ when Jheraal rode into the servants' view. One did not cry before Hellknights,\
  \ and one certainly did not conspire to commit crimes. A sullen hush fell over the\
  \ Celverian household as Jheraal's chestnut destrier trotted across the graveled\
  \ path, coming to a halt before the chief steward.</p> \n     <p>He was a tall man,\
  \ spare and elegant and silver-haired, and although Jheraal was framed against the\
  \ sun, he looked up into its full glare without blinking. \"Sir?\"</p> \n     <p>\"\
  I'm here to investigate the murders.\" Jheraal removed her fearsome, devil-visaged\
  \ helm, allowing the servants to see her face.</p> \n     <p>It caused a stir, as\
  \ she had known it would. House Celverian's people were well trained, and other\
  \ than a gasp from one of the youngest grooms and a few tightened mouths and half-steps\
  \ backward, none showed an overt reaction to her appearance. But Jheraal read their\
  \ shock all the same.</p> \n     <p>The hellspawn taint ran strong in her. Jheraal's\
  \ skin was white as snow and covered with fine, soft scales, each one edged with\
  \ a faint shimmer of copper. A pair of four-inch horns, curved and sharp as a goat's,\
  \ poked through her bronze-streaked black hair. They fitted into the hollows of\
  \ the horns in her helm, and had indirectly served as inspiration for the same.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>It was not unheard of for the devil-blooded to serve among the Hellknights,\
  \ but neither was it common. In Cheliax, hellspawn were widely considered to be\
  \ no part of proper society, and few of them received the training in arms or spellcraft\
  \ needed to gain acceptance into the Hellknight orders' ranks. Yet here she was,\
  \ armored in the scarred breastplate and horned helm that marked her as a full Hellknight\
  \ sworn to the Order of the Scourge.</p> \n     <p>The chief steward, a consummate\
  \ professional, tipped his head downward in an extremely correct nod, affording\
  \ Jheraal precisely the degree of courtesy that her status warranted. \"It is our\
  \ honor. Should we be expecting any of your associates?\"</p> \n     <p>As he spoke,\
  \ his eyes flicked to the star of bleeding lashes painted on Jheraal's shield. That\
  \ was the Scourge's sigil, and the steward's unspoken query was clear: <i>Will the\
  \ Order of the Rack be coming?</i></p> \n     <p>It was a delicate question. The\
  \ Hellknight Order of the Rack, based in Citadel Rivad near Westcrown, was the primary\
  \ order of Hellknights in the city. Jheraal's order, the Scourge, was less well\
  \ known and much less strongly represented, which was both advantage and disadvantage:\
  \ it gave her greater independence, but fewer resources to call upon.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>Less currency with the common people, too. As Westcrown had long been troubled\
  \ by rumblings of dissent, Her Imperial Majestrix, Queen Abrogail Thrune II, had\
  \ granted the Order of the Rack wide-sweeping authority to detain, question, and\
  \ even execute suspected rebels in the city.</p> \n     <p>And although the Order\
  \ of the Rack held the preservation of peace to be its highest duty, the methods\
  \ it chose to achieve that duty were not always peaceful. In much of Westcrown,\
  \ the order had a fearsome reputation. Few Wiscrani were glad to see them coming.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>House Celverian, Jheraal recalled, might have more reason than most\
  \ to be wary where the Order of the Rack was concerned. There had been some trouble\
  \ with the eldest son, who'd gotten caught up in the idealistic fervor of the young.\
  \ He hadn't been accused of any serious wrongdoing, and his father's influence had\
  \ hushed any whiff of scandal, but nevertheless the boy had been sent packing to\
  \ a crusader's exile in Mendev.</p> \n     <p>That had been years ago. Well over\
  \ a decade, in fact. But fear could take a long time dying, and Jheraal couldn't\
  \ blame the servants of House Celverian for being cautious.</p> \n     <p>\"The\
  \ Order of the Rack has no part in this investigation,\" she said. Some of the servants\
  \ relaxed visibly at her words. Out of long habit, Jheraal noted their faces, as\
  \ well as those of the servants who didn't blink at all. \"The dottari will assist\
  \ in whatever capacity they can, but they will not send a separate investigator.\
  \ In this matter, I serve both the throne and my order. All of us wish to see your\
  \ master's killer brought to justice. You have my condolences for your loss.\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"We are grateful for your kindness. I have the honor of being Belvadio,\
  \ chief steward of this house. Lord Abello Celverian should be arriving late tonight\
  \ or early tomorrow. In the meantime, the household staff is at your disposal.\"\
  \ The chief steward clapped his hands, signaling the end of the assembly. In a flurry\
  \ of curtseys and bows, the maids, cooks, and house servants dispersed. Jheraal\
  \ dismounted, and one of the grooms led her horse away. Two servants, a pair of\
  \ boys who looked no older than fourteen, remained behind at the steward's signal.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Achio and Tirol were the first to discover the... the... what had\
  \ been done,\" Belvadio said, clearing his throat. \"They found Nappandi, one of\
  \ our guards, lying in the hedges and came together to wake me a little after midnight.\
  \ I hastened to wake the young master, and that is when we found him. Master Othando\
  \ had been murdered in his study, where he was accustomed to read nearly until dawn.\
  \ There are still two servants unaccounted for. We have not found their bodies,\
  \ but I fear the worst.\" The chief steward took a breath, quavering only slightly.\
  \ \"Where would you like to begin?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Show it to me as you found\
  \ it.\" Jheraal had no reason to doubt the steward's honesty, but if there were\
  \ any gaps in his story, she expected that it would be easiest to find them by walking\
  \ alongside Belvadio and seeing whether the evidence matched his words.</p> \n \
  \    <p>\"Of course. Please, this way.\" With a courtly bow, Belvadio led his armored\
  \ guest through the gardens' fragrant shade toward the honeysuckle-threaded hedges\
  \ that encircled the vaneo. Overhead, the birds continued their merry, oblivious\
  \ song.</p> \n     <p>Although House Celverian's main seat lay in the hinterlands,\
  \ and its manor in Westcrown was not as grand or expansive as the sprawling estates\
  \ called vira, it took several minutes for them to reach the bloodstained spot by\
  \ the walls where Nappandi's body had been found.</p> \n     <p>There wasn't much\
  \ blood. Only a few brownish drops, already mostly soaked into the earth, and a\
  \ patch of crushed clover near the base of the hedges where the body had lain. In\
  \ the darkness, screened by the dense thorned shrubs, it might have been a long\
  \ time before anyone noticed a body at night.</p> \n     <p>Jheraal crouched and\
  \ looked for tracks that might have been left by the killer, but found none. Either\
  \ Nappandi's assailant had known how to hide them, or the servants had already trampled\
  \ out those traces.</p> \n     <p>She straightened with a clanking of steel and\
  \ leather. \"Your guard kept a regular patrol?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Yes. Every hour\
  \ on the hour. Nappandi was extremely diligent. He would never have missed a round,\
  \ nor been a minute late on his circuit.\"</p> \n     <p><i>Predictable, then. Easily\
  \ evaded.</i> The lack of struggle suggested that the killer had never been seen.\
  \ He could have slipped by if he'd wanted, but instead he'd chosen to kill the guard.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Was anything taken from his body?\" Jheraal asked.</p> \n     <p>\"\
  Yes. A ring of keys. Nappandi had keys to most of the vaneo, other than the master's\
  \ private rooms and the wine cellar. That was the only thing I could see that was\
  \ stolen. Do you wish to examine the body?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Later. Show me where\
  \ you went and what you did after you found him.\"</p> \n     <p>Belvadio glanced\
  \ at the two boys behind him. They hung back nervously while Jheraal examined the\
  \ blood-speckled grass. \"After Achio and Tirol told me what they'd found, and I\
  \ had confirmed with my own eyes that this was no prank, we went together to inform\
  \ the master. I also sent word to the captain of our household guard that there\
  \ was a murderer at large in the vaneo.\"</p> \n     <p>\"How many guards do you\
  \ have?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Four.\" The steward grimaced, shaking his head. \"Three,\
  \ with Nappandi dead. But none of the others saw whoever did this.\"</p> \n    \
  \ <p>Jheraal nodded. Three household guards were unlikely, in her estimation, to\
  \ present much difficulty for someone who could kill one of their number so easily\
  \ and silently. That they had seen nothing meant little. There was no need to insult\
  \ their honor by saying so, however. \"Show me to Master Celverian's study.\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"At once.\" With another neat bow, Belvadio strode toward the manor,\
  \ the two younger servants trailing him like puppies. A few steps from the servants'\
  \ door, he hesitated. \"Do you wish to follow precisely the same path we took? These\
  \ halls are... not grand enough for guests, I fear. I would not wish to cause any\
  \ insult.\"</p> \n     <p><i>He is worried about offending the Hellknights.</i>\
  \ Belvadio's concern about ushering her through the servants' door might have been\
  \ reasonable if he'd been dealing with the touchiest of high Chelish lords, but\
  \ she had no illusions that a steward who'd spent his entire life in service to\
  \ a great house really believed that her rank was so exalted, or her skin so thin.\
  \ This was caution and nothing but.</p> \n     <p>Jheraal snorted. \"I'm not a duchess,\
  \ Belvadio. I won't be insulted by walking through the service door. Just show me\
  \ where you went.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Forgive my presumption.\" Producing a ring of\
  \ keys from some unseen pocket inside his blue coat, Belvadio unlocked the door\
  \ and stepped aside to hold it open. \"The young master's library will be up the\
  \ stairs and to the right.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Lead on.\"</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  \ <br><i>Illustration by Jason Rainville</i>\n     </div> \n     <p>He took her\
  \ past the larder and buttery, through the kitchens, and up a flight of well-worn\
  \ wooden stairs. No footprints stood out here, either.</p> \n     <p>At the top\
  \ of the stairs, they reached the discreet little door that separated the servants'\
  \ quarters from the nobles' halls. Quilted padding covered the servants' side of\
  \ the door, insulating their superiors from any unwanted noise or smell that might\
  \ drift up from the kitchens. The other side of the door, Jheraal noted, was painted\
  \ white and adorned with gilded scrollwork. All the unsightliness—and all the function—\
  was on the servants' side.</p> \n     <p>Although the servants' halls had been lit\
  \ only by the daylight that streamed through their small, cloudy windows, enchanted\
  \ lights shone serenely along the ceiling and upper walls of this corridor. Wide\
  \ picture windows overlooked the manor's gardens, while carpets in faded blue and\
  \ white sank under Jheraal's booted feet. The carpets were lush at the periphery\
  \ but worn in the centers. That they hadn't been replaced suggested that House Celverian\
  \ wasn't as rich as it had been in years past. No surprise. Failing fortunes were\
  \ common among the old nobility that had declined to align strongly enough with\
  \ House Thrune.</p> \n     <p>Nevertheless, it was lovely. The airy beauty of the\
  \ upper hall was marred only by the faint whiff of blood that grew stronger as they\
  \ approached an open door on the right.</p> \n     <p>\"In there,\" Belvadio whispered.\
  \ The color had drained from his face.</p> \n     <p>They hadn't moved the body.\
  \ The mortal remains of Othando Celverian remained in the overstuffed armchair where\
  \ he had presumably died. A linen sheet covered his slumped form imperfectly, trailing\
  \ over part of the desk in front of him. A carafe and half-full wineglass rested\
  \ on a silver tray near his elbow. Papers spilled across the floor by his side,\
  \ along with a fallen candle stub trailing a comet's tail of wax spatters.</p> \n\
  \     <p>Jheraal stepped forward to examine him, taking care not to disturb the\
  \ papers. \"This is all as you found it?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Almost. There was...\
  \ a cleric came before you. Udeno of Abadar. He looked over the master and said\
  \ there was nothing he could do. Other than his examination, and the sheet I placed\
  \ over the master, nothing has been touched.\"</p> \n     <p>The Hellknight nodded\
  \ without looking up. With as much delicacy as she could muster, she lifted the\
  \ sheet that covered Othando Celverian.</p> \n     <p>He had been a young man. Twenty-five,\
  \ she guessed. Maybe a year or two to either side. Slim, handsome, with the soft\
  \ hands and pale skin of a scholar who spent little time outdoors. Drying blood\
  \ spilled from a single deep puncture wound on the side of his neck and darkened\
  \ his sleeping robe in a crooked fan that widened as it stretched toward the floor.\
  \ More blood painted the carpet behind him and to the side, and a single brownish-red\
  \ fingerprint smudged his right arm near the elbow.</p> \n     <p>Othando's own\
  \ hands were clean. That bloody fingerprint had come from someone else.</p> \n \
  \    <p>His face was buried in the pages of the book he'd been reading. When Jheraal\
  \ lifted Othando's head, she saw that his eyes were wide and his lips slightly parted.\
  \ The breeze from an open window fluttered dark blond hair across his brow. She\
  \ couldn't tell if he had been talking, trying to cry out, or just gasping for breath\
  \ in his last extremity, but it seemed that he'd been looking at someone when he\
  \ died. The spill of blood from his wound suggested that he had turned toward, and\
  \ then away from, something or someone at his back.</p> \n     <p>The killer? It\
  \ was tempting to conclude that Othando must have seen his assassin. If he had,\
  \ his shade might answer a cleric's prayer and identify his attacker.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>Jheraal had been an investigator long enough to know that such hopes almost\
  \ always proved futile. Something as simple as a mask or hood sufficed to prevent\
  \ recognition, as every professional killer knew, and the dead were blessed with\
  \ no more knowledge than they'd had in life. The Hellknight had worked on dozens\
  \ of murders in the twelve years of her investigative career, all across Cheliax\
  \ and its vassal states, and never once had she seen the spirit of an assassin's\
  \ victim able to identify his killer. Amateurs might be named by the dead. Professionals\
  \ never were.</p> \n     <p>That didn't mean she had no use for magic. Only that\
  \ its use had to be less easily anticipated by her target.</p> \n     <p>She glanced\
  \ at the open book. Drying blood gummed its pages and darkened the illustrations,\
  \ but the lettering remained clear. It looked to be a collection of Taldan heroic\
  \ stories—disgraced knights winning back the honor of tarnished houses, second sons\
  \ and valiant daughters carving names for themselves in savage lands, heroes who\
  \ vanquished monsters and won the love of their people. Tales to stir excitement\
  \ into a quiet life.</p> \n     <p>The letters that had blown onto the floor appeared\
  \ to be correspondence: invitations to various social events from other Wiscrani\
  \ nobility, orders from his lord father at the family estate, and an unfinished\
  \ letter from Othando himself to his exiled brother in Mendev.</p> \n     <p>Drawing\
  \ the sheet back over the body, Jheraal stepped sideways to examine the desk. Two\
  \ of the drawers were partly opened. One held signets in gold and bronze, sticks\
  \ of sealing wax, unsharpened quills, a paring knife, and a wrinkled paper sachet\
  \ of sugar-rolled mints. The other was empty save for a few faded stains at the\
  \ bottom. The remaining drawers were locked.</p> \n     <p>She motioned to the desk.\
  \ \"Was anything taken from here? Or from Master Celverian himself?\"</p> \n   \
  \  <p>\"I cannot be certain,\" Belvadio admitted. \"The master's study was private.\
  \ I did not notice anything stolen, but some small theft might have escaped my notice.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"How busy would the household have been at that hour?\"</p> \n \
  \    <p>The steward took a moment to think it over. \"We had no guests at the vaneo,\
  \ and no entertaining planned for the next few days. Other than one or two of the\
  \ under-cooks in the kitchen and the guards making their rounds, everyone should\
  \ have been sleeping. Achio and Tirol were out only because they were making mischief.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"Was it Master Celverian's custom to leave that window open?\" Jheraal\
  \ gestured to the skylight, although she already knew the answer. That window was\
  \ too high to be opened without the aid of a ladder, and she had seen none in the\
  \ study.</p> \n     <p>Belvadio frowned, confirming her guess. \"Pleasant as the\
  \ weather is, no. The master was concerned that nothing should damage his books—\
  not rain or sun or snow. The window was only to admit light to assist his reading.\
  \ He never opened it.\"</p> \n     <p>\"You said there were two other servants missing?\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"Chiella and Nodero.\" The steward fidgeted with a button, then\
  \ caught himself and stopped, smoothing his coat. \"Chiella was here when I sounded\
  \ the alarm. I saw her with my own eyes. No one recalls seeing Nodero after he retired\
  \ to his room last night. Both were gone by the time I found the master, or soon\
  \ after.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Do you believe they might have played some role in this?\"\
  </p> \n     <p>Belvadio shook his head vehemently. \"Impossible. No one loved House\
  \ Celverian more than Nodero and Chiella. Their loyalty is beyond question.\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"You're sure of that? How?\"</p> \n     <p>The silver-haired man exhaled.\
  \ With a quick, uncomfortable glance at Jheraal, he said: \"House Celverian has\
  \ always been adamant that everyone in its service is to be dealt with fairly, as\
  \ fits each person's talents and disposition, and that no one is to be slighted\
  \ on account of their ancestry.\" Belvadio's eyes flickered to the carpet, avoiding\
  \ her, on the word \"ancestry.\"</p> \n     <p>The missing servants were hellspawn,\
  \ then. No other reason for that discomfort. And not everyone on the staff was as\
  \ accepting as their master had been, judging from the reception she'd gotten on\
  \ the lawn.</p> \n     <p>\"Those who offend this policy are dismissed without references,\
  \ which is a death sentence for employment among the great houses. The young master,\
  \ like his father, was an uncommonly enlightened man, and he was fiercely beloved\
  \ by all who had the good fortune to serve him. It is inconceivable that either\
  \ Chiella or Nodero would ever have done anything to hurt him, or to damage the\
  \ honor of his house.\"</p> \n     <p>\"As you say.\" It sounded like burnishing\
  \ the virtues of the dead to her, but perhaps Othando Celverian really had been\
  \ a saint among men. \"I'll visit the church of Abadar to speak with the cleric\
  \ who examined Master Celverian, and then return to the Order of the Rack's garrison.\
  \ Please send word when his father, Lord Celverian, arrives in Westcrown.\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Of course.\" He followed her back out of the manor, keeping always\
  \ two paces behind and a half-step to the side, like the most discreet of ghosts.\
  \ As they reached the servants' door, however, the steward took a small step forward.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Truly,\" he said, dropping his reserve for a moment and letting her\
  \ see the real anguish beneath, \"I don't believe Chiella or Nodero could have had\
  \ any part in this horror, let alone both of them together. Never. In my bones,\
  \ I know they are innocent. But I do believe someone might try to use them to discredit\
  \ their kind. Not everyone approved of the master's views on hellspawn, and some\
  \ of the servants I was forced to dismiss might seek revenge for their disgrace.\"\
  </p> \n     <p><i>No servant could afford to hire an assassin with that much skill.</i>\
  \ They might have aided in the killer's plots, but they couldn't have been the driving\
  \ force. \"Did he have enemies among the nobility?\"</p> \n     <p>\"The young master?\
  \ No. He was being courted by some of the lesser houses with marriageable daughters,\
  \ but as yet he had chosen none, so no one had reason to be insulted by his refusal.\
  \ He had no position at court and no place in political schemes, and his hobbies\
  \ were harmless. Master Celverian was a dreamer and a scholar. He was no threat\
  \ to anyone.\"</p> \n     <p>\"What about the rest of his house?\"</p> \n     <p>Belvadio\
  \ opened the door. Outside, the sun was a glory and the birds were singing, and\
  \ Westcrown's life went on. Even within the vaneo's walls, the rhythms of the day\
  \ were returning. A washerwoman pinned damp sheets to her lines. Across the yard,\
  \ a stocky, freckle-faced boy carted muck from the stables. Already, the night was\
  \ beginning to recede in their memories.</p> \n     <p>\"Their mistakes are in the\
  \ past,\" the steward said, returning Jheraal to the city.</p> \n     <p style=\"\
  text-align: center;\">∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n     <p>The cleric of Abadar had little to tell\
  \ her. Yes, he had gone to the vaneo that morning. Yes, he had seen Master Celverian's\
  \ corpse. No, he had no suspicions regarding how the murder might have been carried\
  \ out, nor about who would have had a motive to strike at House Celverian's younger\
  \ son.</p> \n     <p>\"It's what they do, isn't it?\" Udeno shrugged. \"The courts\
  \ are snake pits. No surprise when one gets bitten by a viper.\"</p> \n     <p>Jheraal\
  \ hadn't argued, but as she walked down the temple's steps back into the canal-lined\
  \ streets of Westcrown's Rego Sacero, she'd thought, <i>Not like this</i>.</p> \n\
  \     <p>It was true that the Chelish nobility spent an inordinate amount of time\
  \ plotting against each other, and that espionage and assassination were well-used\
  \ weapons in their arsenals. But it was also true that blatant, barefaced murder\
  \ was considered extremely bad form.</p> \n     <p>Cheliax prided itself on being\
  \ a nation governed by law. Its killers might disguise their doings as hunting accidents,\
  \ food poisoning, or highway robberies gone wrong. The more cunning and ambitious\
  \ might even go so far as to trump up criminal charges and let the royal executioners\
  \ take their enemies' heads.</p> \n     <p>But they <i>did</i> disguise their murders,\
  \ because otherwise they invited the full wrath that Cheliax visited upon all those\
  \ who broke its laws.</p> \n     <p>The assassination of a well-born scholar in\
  \ his study was precisely the sort of crime that offended Her Imperial Majestrix\
  \ and insulted her rule. That it had happened in Westcrown, which chafed at its\
  \ loss of prominence under House Thrune and needed little provocation to stoke its\
  \ smoldering discontents into new flame, made the investigation more urgent. And\
  \ that the victim had been an eligible young bachelor who was actively courted by\
  \ several Wiscrani houses added an edge of intrigue. Jheraal guessed that there\
  \ were several furious dowagers who were eager to learn which of their rivals might\
  \ have destroyed their daughters' prospects.</p> \n     <p>For all these reasons,\
  \ it was exceedingly important that she find the killer.</p> \n     <p>No one had\
  \ said this, of course. Not explicitly. The mere fact of her assignment made it\
  \ clear enough. Jheraal was of the Order of the Scourge, and she had been chosen\
  \ to investigate a crime in a city where the Order of the Rack held sway. There\
  \ were any number of messages bound up in that, but the key one was that Her Imperial\
  \ Majestrix expected results. Failure was not to be countenanced. That was why Jheraal,\
  \ of all the investigators available to the Hellknights, had been singled out and\
  \ sent to serve. The Queen wanted answers, and Jheraal was meant to find them.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The obvious course was to question Lord Celverian. But the lord hadn't\
  \ yet arrived in Westcrown, so Jheraal returned to Taranik House, the Order of the\
  \ Rack's base of operations in the city, to see whether any messages had come.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>There was one. The courier, a towheaded halfling boy, was standing in\
  \ the foyer and filling his satchel with new missives when Jheraal arrived. He dropped\
  \ the packet he was holding and waved excitedly when he saw her. \"Jheraal! Hellknight\
  \ Jheraal!\"</p> \n     <p>Jheraal raised a hand to calm him. \"What?\"</p> \n \
  \    <p>\"I have a message of utmost urgency. Utmost! From Durotas Tuornos. His\
  \ rundottari found bodies in Rego Cader. Two from House Celverian. The durotas said\
  \ you'd want to know immediately. Here—he wrote this for you, but it only says the\
  \ same thing.\" The boy held out a folded slip. It had been hastily written. The\
  \ ink soaked through the cheap paper.</p> \n     <p>\"He was correct.\" The Hellknight\
  \ took the letter, gave it a cursory look, and put her horned helm back on. Rego\
  \ Cader, the long-abandoned Dead Sector of the city, was infamously perilous, full\
  \ of thieves and murderers and worse. Even the dottari, Westcrown's city guard,\
  \ didn't like to linger in those blighted ruins. Rego Cader was so dangerous that\
  \ it had its own division of the guard—the rundottari, or \"ruin wardens\"—dedicated\
  \ exclusively to holding back the threats that proliferated in that sector. \"Bodies,\
  \ you said. Where, exactly? Are they still there?\"</p> \n     <p>\"I don't know.\"\
  \ The halfling said, fumbling to pick up the packet he'd dropped, \"but Durotas\
  \ Tuornos is on the Obrigan Gate. He hoped that you would hurry. He hoped, also,\
  \ that you would send word to the capital. For a wizard.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Why?\
  \ Aren't there enough wizards in Westcrown?\"</p> \n     <p>\"I don't know.\" The\
  \ boy shook his head in helpless confusion. He closed his overstuffed bag and went\
  \ to the door. \"The durotas didn't tell me, not really. All he said was that there\
  \ was magic in this. Deviltry. And... \" he swallowed, \"and that the dead might\
  \ not be dead.\" </p>\n    </blockquote> \n    <p style=\"text-align: center;\"\
