  >Season of Factions' Favor</a>, our current—and weirdest—Adventure Path for the\
  \ Pathfinder Adventure Card Game is well underway. Designed by Keith Richmond with\
  \ story by Katina Davis, Adventure 1, <a href=\"/products/btpy9wen?Pathfinder-Society-Adventure-Card-Guild-41-Chasing-Yellow-Sails\"\
  ><em>Chasing Yellow Sails</em></a>, kicked off at Gen Con, leading the adventurers\
  \ into the slave markets of Okeno in pursuit of a captured criminal. It's a rollicking\
  \ adventure, and the upcoming Adventure 2 is also a mindbender.</p> \n    <p>But\
  \ it's our first free promo scenario, the newly released <a href=\"/products/btpy9who?Pathfinder-Society-Adventure-Card-Guild-4P-Murder-in-the-Marketplace\"\
  ><em>Murder in the Marketplace</em></a> that takes place between those adventures,\
  \ that I think everyone will talk about for some time.</p> \n    <p>When the Pathfinder\
  \ Society's John Compton and Tonya Woldridge first approached me about their plans\
  \ for this Adventure Path, they had to answer the burning question: How do we justify\
  \ the inclusion of our upcoming <a href=\"/products/btpy9s2o\"><em>Hell's Vengeance\
  \ Character Deck 1</em></a> and <a href=\"/products/btpy9sjy\"><em>Deck 2</em></a>?\
  \ The characters in Hell's Vengeance are all unrelentingly evil. Unlike in the RPG\
  \ side of organized play, the ACG can handle evil characters. So characters like\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy97ic\">Wrathack</a>, <a href=\"/products/btpy97ib\">Tontelizi</a>,\
  \ and <a href=\"/products/btpy97id\">Wu Shen</a> are all street-legal. But with\
  \ Hell's Vengeance, these folks have a purpose. They work as a team. An evil team.\
  \ For evil.</p> \n    <p>To make it clear why they would work with good guys, we\
  \ needed to justify their inclusion in the story arc. I won't spoil for you why\
  \ they're there. But I will tell you the way we set it up, because it's cool. Designed\
  \ by Keith and written by Linda Zayas-Palmer, <em>Murder in the Marketplace</em>\
  \ is not one scenario, it's three. Each one is a battle to find and defeat one of\
  \ the Deck 1 iconics: the cleric Lazzero, the hellknight Linxia, or the antipaladin\
  \ Urgraz. You can play any one of the scenarios you want, or all three. Because\
  \ the purpose is not only to defeat these baddies, it's to <i>unleash</i> them.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>If you win one of these Murder-fests, you get a special reward. Here's\
  \ Lazzero's, with Linxia's and Urgraz's following the same pattern.</p> \n    <blockquote>\
  \ \n     <p>Each player may, for each future scenario, choose to exchange his character\
  \ that completed this scenario with Lazzero from <em>Hell's Vengeance Character\
  \ Deck 1</em>. Lazzero gets the same number of skill, power, and card feats as the\
  \ exchanged character, as well as all other applicable rewards that character has\
  \ earned (including any valid deck upgrades and a role card if appropriate). Build\
  \ Lazzero's deck from the <em>Hell's Vengeance Character Deck 1</em> box using the\
  \ Hierarchy from the <a href=\"/products/btpy98no\"><em>Pathfinder Society Adventure\
  \ Card Guild Guide</em></a>. The exchanged character receives any rewards and upgrades\
  \ from the scenario. Report the character as Unlocked Cleric Lazzero.</p> \n   \
  \ </blockquote> \n    <p>When you unlock this character, you can swap him in for\
  \ any other Adventure Card Guild character that completed that version of P1. At\
  \ any time. At any <i>tier</i>. You don't have to build up the character over time.\
  \ You just pick a character to swap for and say \"I want to play this scenario with\
  \ the guy in the devil hat here.\" Or the woman with the forehead tattoo. Or the\
  \ guy with the crossbow bigger than his body. Whatever. And something similar will\
  \ occur between adventures 2 and 3 for the Deck 2 characters.</p> \n    <p>Why do\
  \ they get this amazing flexibility? I already told you that. It's because they're\
  \ evil. And rules are for suckers. We'll have a preview of Deck 1 next time, and\
  \ you can see what I mean.</p> \n    <p>Mike Selinker<br> <i>Adventure Card Game\
