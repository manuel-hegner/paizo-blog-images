  \ </div> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">While we all live moment-by-moment,\
  \ we are also shaped by our past. This is especially true for adventurers. After\
  \ all, very few elves at the ripe age of 14 think to themselves, \"Hey, I think\
  \ I'm going to become a barbarian.\" There is a path that leads the character to\
  \ their class. It might synergize obviously with the class's discipline, or at first\
  \ blush it might seem a non sequitur, but the path is there.</p> \n     <p>In the\
  \ Pathfinder Playtest, your ancestry talks a bit about your past, but it also speaks\
  \ to your present and the promise of the future, by virtue of the fact that you\
  \ continue to gain ancestry feats through the course of your adventuring career.\
  \ But to help you dig deeper into your past, you'll choose a background.</p> \n\
  \     <p>Generally, backgrounds allow you to select a bit of backstory that mechanically\
  \ affects the current state of your character. The first thing it does is grants\
  \ you a pair of ability boosts (with some limitations on one of those ability boosts),\
  \ and then it grants a skill feat tied to the theme of your background and proficiency\
  \ in a Lore skill that also ties into the background. For instance, here is an old\
  \ chestnut:</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb360\">\n      <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20180406-ElfDwarf.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20180406-ElfDwarf_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n      <p><i>Illustration by Wayne Reynolds</i></p>\n     </div> \n     <blockquote>\
  \ \n      <h3>Blacksmith (Background)</h3> \n      <p>You were a blacksmith or a\
  \ blacksmith's apprentice, and during countless hours toiling at the forge, you\
  \ learned how to smith armor and weapons. Perhaps you worked hard each day and dreamed\
  \ of adventure each night, or perhaps the adventuring life was thrust upon you by\
  \ a pivotal event.</p> \n      <p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength\
  \ or Intelligence, and one is a free ability boost.</p> \n      <p>You gain the\
  \ Specialty Crafting skill feat for blacksmithing, and you're trained in the Smithing\
  \ Lore skill.</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>Sure, it's a bit cliche, but it's\
  \ a fun cliche. Before becoming a fighter, you were a blacksmith's apprentice. Maybe\
  \ you crafted your sword or suit of armor and decided to protect home and hearth\
  \ from monsters. But take a closer look at the background. It's more flexible than\
  \ that. It's also an excellent background for an alchemist or another character\
  \ who wants to specialize in crafting. Since you can boost Intelligence via this\
  \ background, and Intelligence is the key ability score for both Crafting skill\
  \ and the alchemist class, you can refocus this background into that of an intelligent\
  \ tinkerer who uses innovation rather than toil to create metal objects. And who\
  \ knows? Maybe later on in your career, you can fuse your background with other\
  \ skill feats to invent a new form of alchemical armor or some kind of metal construct.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Not all backgrounds have to do with gainful employment; others deal\
  \ with the circumstances of your upbringing that you can parlay into useful skills.\
  \ Here is another example of a classic fantasy trope:</p> \n     <blockquote> \n\
  \      <h3>Street Urchin (Background)</h3> \n      <p>You eked out a living by picking\
  \ pockets on the streets of a major city, never knowing where you'd find your next\
  \ meal. While some folk adventure for the glory, you adventure as a means of survival.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or Intelligence,\
  \ and one is a free ability boost.</p> \n      <p>You gain the Pickpocket skill\
  \ feat, and you're trained in the Underworld Lore skill.</p> \n     </blockquote>\
  \ \n     <p>While a classic rogue background, this background also has enough flexibility\
  \ to serve as a perfectly fine background for a wizard or alchemist, and that's\
  \ only if you dwell on the limited ability boost. Remember, one of the ability boosts\
  \ if free, so you can play against type and still make a perfectly reasonable character.\
  \ Imagine a paladin with this background, which isn't so hard if you know anything\
  \ about a certain iconic paladin...</p> \n     <p>Not all backgrounds are so all-encompassing,\
  \ though. After all, your background not only deals with activity but also your\
  \ personal focus. You may have been an apprentice blacksmith, even for a long while,\
  \ but retained none of its benefits because you were too busy dreaming about being\
  \ a Pathfinder.</p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <h3>Pathfinder Hopeful (Background)</h3>\
  \ \n      <p>You've long wanted to join the adventurous Pathfinder Society, a world-spanning\
  \ organization of relic hunters. This aspiration has led you to take up the dangerous\
  \ life of an adventurer eager to make a name for yourself and gain the attention\
  \ of the Pathfinder Society.</p> \n      <p>Choose two ability boosts. One must\
  \ be to Strength or Intelligence, and one is a free ability boost.</p> \n      <p>You\
  \ gain the Additional Lore feat, and you're trained in the Pathfinder Society Lore\
  \ skill.</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>While the boosts are similar to that\
  \ of the blacksmith background, the skill selection is, of course, different. I\
  \ can easily picture this background as that of a young dreamer, toiling away when\
  \ she must but finding whatever time she can to read various Pathfinder Chronicles\
  \ (both real and forged) and honing her body and mind for the chance to join the\
  \ Pathfinder Society.</p> \n     <p>Incidentally, this is not a background you will\
  \ find in the Pathfinder Playtest Rulebook. While that weighty tome provides 19\
  \ backgrounds, you'll find six more backgrounds in the Pathfinder Playtest Adventure:\
  \ Doomsday Dawn. Those six are tailor-made for the adventure, granting the opportunity\
  \ for small, sometimes incidental perks during play for those who take them and\
  \ allowing you to tailor your character to the story. This is one of the chief benefits\
  \ of the background systemâ€”it can be used to make very general backgrounds or to\
  \ tailor specific backgrounds to an adventure or a campaign.</p> \n     <p>And so\
  \ there you have it; that's the skinny on backgrounds. What kind of backgrounds\
  \ can you imagine?</p> \n     <p>Stephen Radney-MacFarland<br> <i>Senior Designer</i></p>\
