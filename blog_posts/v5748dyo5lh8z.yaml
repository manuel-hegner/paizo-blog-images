  \ <p>Some of you may recall <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5laj3\">an upstart goblin\
  \ poking around the Paizo offices some five years ago</a>, stealing ears and feeding\
  \ the cave raptors. A goblin who vanished—under mysterious circumstances no less—\
  after her ill-advised journey into the wildest depths of the warehouse.</p> \n \
  \    <p>That goblin was me. I have returned! Rejoice!</p> \n     <p>For those of\
  \ you less versed in goblin lore: I am Crystal Frasier, author, illustrator, cartographer,\
  \ and Paizo's newest assistant developer. What does an assistant developer do, you\
  \ ask? That is an excellent question! I'm glad you asked! Moving on...</p> \n  \
  \   <p>As I mentioned, I spent a fun five years working for Paizo as a production\
  \ assistant and digital products assistant before leaving for a spell to make it\
  \ on my own as a freelance writer, artist, and general awesome girl. But a freelancer's\
  \ life is an isolated one, and without my shining smile to warm their days, Paizo\
  \ employees began to wilt.* So for my own good and theirs, I have returned to beam\
  \ my glorious radiance down. Also to develop books and edit statblocks—but mostly\
  \ the beaming.</p> \n     <p>I've been gaming since the early nineties, when my\
  \ love of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles comics lead me into the seedy world of the\
  \ Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Other Strangeness roleplaying game. From this\
  \ harmless gateway RPG, I explored Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Silver Age Sentinels,\
  \ GURPS, West End's Star Wars, and eventually Pathfinder. In those few minutes a\
  \ week when I'm not playing tabletop games, reading game manuals, running games,\
  \ writing game material, or dreaming about running games for Hayley Atwell, I like\
  \ to read comics, make candy, and walk my corgi, Calamity.</p> \n     <p>It's good\
  \ to be back.</p> \n     <p>Someone's got to feed those cave raptors!</p> \n   \
  \  <p>Crystal Frasier<br> <i>Assistant Developer</i></p> \n    </blockquote> \n\
  \    <p>Please join us in welcoming Crystal back to Paizo!</p> \n    <p>F. Wesley\
  \ Schneider<br> <i>Editor-in-Chief</i></p> \n    <p class=\"tiny\">*Wes's Note:\
