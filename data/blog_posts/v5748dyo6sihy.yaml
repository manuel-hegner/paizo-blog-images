  \ It’s been a while since we’ve done one of these blogs, and in that time, we’ve\
  \ added some wonderful new folks to the Creative Department and had a couple of\
  \ former Paizo creatives return to lend their expertise to Pathfinder and Starfinder.\
  \ Since it has been a while, some of these folks have been with us for quite a few\
  \ months, but you didn’t know that and that’s no reason not to join us in welcoming\
  \ them. It’s been great having new people and new voices on the team in design,\
  \ development, art, and edit to add their keen experience and varied experiences\
  \ to the fabric of the Paizo Creative Department.</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \      <h3><strong>Michelle Kim</strong></h3>\n      <p>Hey everyone! I’m Michelle,\
  \ a developer on Pathfinder’s Narrative team. I started off as a freelance writer\
  \ for Paizo so you’ll see my name pop up in projects like&nbsp;<em>Season of Ghosts,\
  \ Howl of the Wild,&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Lost Omens Divine Mysteries&nbsp;</em>as\
  \ well as some other unannounced products down the pipeline. I’m a big fan of horror\
  \ ttrpgs like&nbsp;<em>Call of Cthulhu</em>,&nbsp;<em>Ten Candles</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Bluebeard’\
  s Bride</em>&nbsp;but also a huge sucker for mecha games like&nbsp;<em>Spectres\
  \ of Brocken.&nbsp;</em>I’ll play almost anything; crunchy? Yes. Narrative? Also\
  \ yes.I have a few personal projects in the works including a Joseon setting supplement\
  \ for&nbsp;<em>Good Society: A Jane Austen RPG</em>. If you want to find me on socials,\
  \ I’m on Twitter at @_missmyk_ and on Bluesky at @missmyk.bsky.social.</p>\n   \
  \   <br>\n      <h3><strong>Lynne Meyer</strong></h3>\n      <p>Hello! I’m Lynne\
  \ (she/they), a queer, autistic, chronically ill femme originally from Chicago.\
  \ Since joining the editing team last June, I’ve been living my best Leslie Knope\
  \ life in Indiana and working on incredible stuff I can’t wait for you all to see.</p>\n\
  \      <p>Named a 2021 Queer in Games Awardee by Rainbow Game Jam, I’m best known\
  \ for my work on the ENNIE Award-winning Uncaged: Goddesses and Uncaged Anthology.\
  \ In my free time these days, I’m usually doing one of three things: playing the\
  \ Chief Medical Officer in my Star Trek Adventures home game; doting on Izzy, my\
  \ ancient, beloved kitty; or drinking way too much coffee as I wrap writing for\
  \ the upcoming All the Witches TTRPG. I’m an unapologetic dice goblin, an em dash\
  \ enthusiast, and an octopus stan who thinks that the Dumbo Octopus is the cutest\
  \ thing ever. Come say hello on Bluesky (@lynnemeyer.bsky.social) and Twitter (@Lynne_M_Meyer).</p>\n\
  \      <br>\n      <h3><strong>Joshua Birdsong (he/him)</strong></h3>\n      <p>Hello\
  \ Paizo fans! I am Joshua Birdsong. I am now the newest Designer on the Rules &amp;\
  \ Lore team. I am very excited to work among such an experienced team, and I am\
  \ still (and hopefully always will be) learning so much. I cannot wait to help make\
  \ awesome stuff for our game! I believe my first debut will be in Monster Core!\

  \      </div>\n      <h3>Adriana Gasperi</h3>\n      <p>I am Adriana Gasperi from\
  \ Caracas, Venezuela, I am a graphic designer, traditional and digital illustrator,\
  \ and fine artist in Portland, Oregon since 2017. I have been painting cats since\
  \ 1995 my brand name is Gatos Ilimitados (unlimited cats)&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/adriana.gasperi.art/\"\
  >https://www.instagram.com/adriana.gasperi.art/</a>&nbsp;and lately I have been\
  \ also painting all kinds of animals, and pet portraits. I have been vegan for the\
  \ animals for about 8 years and belong to an international group of vegan artists\
  \ called The Art of Compassion Project where we donate art related to animals and\
  \ veganism. I live with my husband and 6 cats in downtown Portland. I love my job\
  \ at Paizo and also the diversity and inclusiveness of the company, I enjoy working\
  \ from home. I am a true crime documentary and podcast fan, Serial Killers is one\
  \ of my favorite podcasts, as thrillers and horror movies (especially classics),\
  \ film noir, American Horror Story, and all their new ones like American Crime Story,\
  \ actually everything Ryan Murphy creates and produces, The Shinning and Psycho\
  \ are two of my favorite movies.</p>\n      <br>\n      <h3>Jason Keeley</h3>\n\
  \      <p>Who, me? I guess you could say that I’m one of those “returning faces,”\
  \ having come back to Paizo last year to take a position as a Senior Developer on\
  \ the Pathfinder Rules &amp; Lore Team! In my career at Paizo, I’ve been an editor,\
  \ a developer of Starfinder Adventure Paths, and more! I’m thrilled to be working\
  \ with second edition and with the rest of this team, who are an honest-to-goodness\
  \ bunch of rock stars. You can find me at herzwesten on a lot of the social medias\
  \ and if you want to see the type of things I get up to in my spare time, check\
  \ out This Compleat Breakfast (a game about cereal mascots) on my <a href=\"https://herzwesten.itch.io/this-compleat-breakfast\"\
  >itch.io page</a>!</p>\n      <br>\n      <h3>Felix Dritz (he/him)</h3>\n      <p>Greetings\
  \ fellow finders of the paths and stars! I’m Felix, one of the editors who sift\
  \ through the many words you read. This means I check for general errors, discrepancies,\
  \ formatting, and ensure it has that recognizable Paizo style.</p>\n      <p>I was\
  \ first introduced to Pathfinder Organized Play in 2016 by accident, and I never\
  \ left. So many kind and supportive people adopted me into this community, and I’\
  m overjoyed that I get to support the games they love. It’s been a surreal journey\
  \ to get here, but now I’m at a desk editing for a game I adore and the community\
  \ I love.</p>\n      <p>When not editing for Paizo, I’m usually homebrewing my ever-expanding\
  \ Pathfinder 2nd Edition setting. If I’m not editing or writing, then I’m likely\
  \ playing Pathfinder, GMing at local game stores, mashing buttons on a videogame\
  \ controller, or cooking. I’m not active on social media, but I hope to meet you\
  \ around the table someday!</p>\n      <br>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n\

  \      <h3>Bill Fischer</h3>\n      <p>Bill Fischer has been creating strange and\
  \ terrifying worlds for role-playing games for over 30 years. He is the author of&nbsp;<em>The\
  \ Runewild Campaign Setting</em>&nbsp;published by Sneak Attack Press and has done\
  \ both writing and editing for Kobold Press, Goodman Games, Roll For Combat, AAW\
  \ Games, and EN Publishing. He lives in Minneapolis, MN with his partner and children.</p>\n\
  \      <br>\n      <h3>Mike Kimmel</h3>\n      <p>Hello! I’m Mike Kimmel, and I’\
  m thrilled to be the newest member of the Starfinder team. Since coming on board\
  \ in September 2023, I’ve been hard at work with my colleagues to create Starfinder\
  \ Second Edition. While my prior work as a developer for Pathfinder Society Organized\
  \ Play mostly involved adventure design, I’ve been able to stretch my narrative\
  \ and game design muscles on the Starfinder team in all sorts of interesting ways\
  \ these past few months. Alas, I can’t talk much about the things I’m working on—\
  yet—but stay tuned for more Starfinder news in the coming weeks! I can’t wait for\
  \ you to see what we’ve got in store for you.</p>\n      <p>Aside from working on\
  \ games, I like to play them, too! I’m a fan of cooperative games of all kinds,\
  \ and I also enjoy relaxing with a nice cup of tea and a challenging permadeath\
  \ videogame. When I get a chance to run an RPG campaign, I tend to lean into horror\
  \ themes—the spookier the better. If you’d like to chat about games, recommend a\
  \ good book to me, or play some chess, you can find me on various Paizo-related\
  \ Discord channels or drop me a line at <a href=\"mailto:mike.kimmel@paizo.com\"\
  >mike.kimmel@paizo.com</a>. Please note that I am not accepting glitch gremlins\
  \ or other mischief at this time!</p>\n      <br>\n      <h3>Simone D. Sallé (she/they)</h3>\n\
  \      <p>Hi again! I’ve been in the Paizo orbit as a temp, freelance, and full-time\
  \ contracted editor since 2018. I joined the staff as a senior editor in 2022 and\
  \ have been having a wonderful time wrangling words with the creative team ever\
  \ since! While we’ve worked on a lot of great projects lately, I’m particularly\
  \ excited for everyone to see &lt;em&gt;<em>Pathfinder Howl of the Wild</em>&lt;/em&gt;\
  \ in May, which has some extremely fun new ancestries and mechanics, incredible\
  \ art, and a heartfelt story.</p>\n      <p>Unsurprisingly, words and games fill\
  \ a lot of my time outside of work as well: I have a spreadsheet of SFF book recs\
  \ for anyone who asks, a handful of Pathfinder and indie TTRPG campaigns on my calendar,\
  \ and an overflowing queue of Steam games that I frequently ignore to revisit Subnautica\
  \ (my beloved). I also do freelance editorial work as Wildwood Editing for projects\
  \ like Queerfinder and Luminant Age. I’m grateful to my Disreputable Dog, Penny\
  \ Kibeth, for reminding me to take a break from screens and get some fresh air every\
  \ day.</p>\n      <p>Editors largely operate behind the scenes, and our best work\
  \ is invisible, but I can confidently say that I work with some of the finest professionals\
  \ in the industry, and it’s a delight to learn, grow, and help shape the games I\
  \ love with them and everyone else at Paizo. I’m not as active on social media these\
  \ days, but if you track me down I’m always thrilled to discuss conscious language\
  \ in storytelling, the merits of style guides, and how we can make our worlds—both\
  \ real and imagined—better for everyone.</p>\n     </blockquote>\n    </div><!--\
