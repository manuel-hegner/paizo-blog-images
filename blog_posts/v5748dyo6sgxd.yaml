  \ here to kick off another new series of blogs. Each blog in this series will attempt\
  \ to do a behind-the-scenes look at an adventure in an adventure path. We’ll start\
  \ with Edge of Anarchy, the first <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01ws8?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Curse-of-the-Crimson-Throne-Adventure-Path\"\
  >Curse of the Crimson Throne</a> adventure, but there are plenty more Adventure\
  \ Paths after that. Each blog will include anecdotes from design and suggested options\
  \ for changing the difficulty of scenarios or spicing up replay. I invite you to\
  \ “Play It Your Way” my way. It’s fun! (Warning: Many of these suggestions increase\
  \ the complexity and/or difficulty of the game, so are most appropriate for experienced\
  \ players!)</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/091319_TheHarrows.jpg\"\

  \ alt=\"Harrow Suit Effects: Adventure 1-6\"></a> \n      <p style=\"font-size:\
  \ 13px;\">Harrow of Keys really spices up Edge of Anarchy.</p> \n     </div> \n\
  \     <p>In Curse of the Crimson Throne, each adventure is associated with a specific\
  \ Harrow suit, so consider adding the Harrows wildcard that corresponds to the Harrow\
  \ suit for that adventure. For Edge of Anarchy, that’s the Harrow of Keys. If you\
  \ don’t want to just increase the difficulty by adding a wildcard, you could make\
  \ the game a little easier by starting each scenario with a free exploration of\
  \ the Base and making the Base not close if it’s out of supporters. That’s an easy\
  \ way to make the supporters a lot more accessible to the whole group, which might\
  \ be more fun for some groups. </p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\

  \ Captain Hook.</p> \n     </div> \n     <p>The Adventure Path's introductory scenario\
  \ is 1★: Haunted Fortunes. It’s adapted from (and shares its name with) the first\
  \ part of the first chapter of the RPG Adventure Path. I think it’s my favorite\
  \ introduction to an RPG Adventure Path: Each character is invited to think of some\
  \ reason to hate a despicable criminal, Gaedren Lamm, then gets to rescue a bunch\
  \ of orphans on the way to bringing justice to him. Drawn together by this mutual\
  \ hatred and a mysterious fortune-telling, you instantly create a party and dive\
  \ right into play. When I ran it for my wife, her character had two reasons to hate\
  \ Lamm: he’d kidnapped her and her twin sister, and he’d fed my wife’s character\
  \ to his alligator. (Don’t worry: she got better. Sort of. She also eventually found\
  \ her sister. Sort of.)</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/091319_ThePerils.jpg\"\

  \ <del>and profit</del>!</p> \n     </div> \n     <p>For this scenario I’d additionally\
  \ consider any of the Perils wildcard Wearisome, the Onslaughts wildcard Impoverished,\
  \ or the Perils wildcard Hostile (in roughly increasing order of difficulty). Wearisome\
  \ isn’t too painful at this level, but it does keep people’s turns from getting\
  \ too long. Impoverished lets you start with a better hand, at the cost of losing\
  \ some cards and being closer to death; not ideal, but also not too bad in your\
  \ first scenario. Hostile makes a lot more checks a lot more dangerous, so is a\
  \ good pick for those seeking a real challenge. Villain scenarios can also often\
  \ use an extra location to increase difficulty for experienced groups, so I’d add\
  \ the next location on the list; if you’re a group of 6, I’d add Abandoned Shacks.\

  >So loyal he still wears his uniform while committing his treason.</p> \n     </div>\
  \ \n     <p>The next scenario is 1A: A City Gone Mad. The villain here, Verik Vancaskerkin,\
  \ doesn’t actually know about the dastardly deeds of the thugs working for him,\
  \ so if you manage to find the Evidence or talk him into surrendering, you get a\
  \ bonus ally and blessing for your trouble. Which is great. Apparently it’s news\
  \ to Verik that people calling themselves “The Cow Hammer Boys” and operating out\
  \ of a shop called “All The World’s Meat” at the address “22 Stirge Street” were\
  \ up to no good, where “no good” is selling people meat. No, not selling people\
  \ meat—selling people meat. Cannibalism. (I’m not sure how that term works if you’\
  re an elf eating a dwarf, though.) When I ran the RPG and the PCs reported what\
  \ they found to Verik, I assumed the proper reaction to “Sir, the men have been\
  \ moonlighting as assassins who turn people into ribeyes. Also, how was dinner last\
  \ night?” would be shocked bewilderment followed by vomiting.</p> \n     <p>I’d\
  \ recommend the Perils wildcard Deadly here. I also like adding a location (Alley\
  \ for 6 characters). After that, I’d use any of Wearisome, Impoverished, or Hostile,\
  \ especially if you didn’t use them in Haunted Fortunes. </p> \n     <div class=\"\

  >Before playing 1B: The Ambassador’s Secret, please observe its FAQ.</a> </p> \n\
  \     <p>The next scenario is an example of the ‘Solve the Mystery’ style scenario,\
  \ where you get free examinations that let you move cards around between locations\
  \ while you try to deal with Trigger barriers. I made the first test scenario of\
  \ this type for <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy9g8v\">Season of the Righteous\
  \ 3</a>, based on a concept I’d intended for this very path. I got to experiment\
  \ with the format a bunch more in other seasons, especially Season of the Plundered\
  \ Tombs. This scenario also led to my favorite testing anecdote ever: After the\
  \ monster Giant Fly was shuffled randomly into the location Spider Nest, the tester\
  \ commented “Either a bad idea for the fly, or it's off to get revenge for its kind,”\
  \ to which another tester asked “Well, how big are the spiders?” I supplied the\
  \ above picture, and got a prompt response of “Bad idea then.”</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ Perils wildcard Ablaze, dealing Poison damage instead of Fire, is a very thematic\
  \ (albeit painful) option for this scenario. To increase the difficulty, consider\
  \ shortening the first scenario power to just “At the end of your turn, you may\
  \ examine the top card of your location,” or changing the final phrase to “then\
  \ put that card on top of a random location.” Requiring an additional Evidence (by\
  \ removing the “or equal to” from the second scenario power) is also a solid option.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Scenario 1C: The Dead Warrens can easily be the toughest scenario in\
  \ the adventure. This is true for thematic reasons and also because it was originally\
  \ the final scenario of the adventure. For story and pacing reasons, we wanted to\
  \ keep the chase after Trinia and the execution together. </p> \n     <p>The Perils\
  \ wildcard Confusing is a perfectly thematic choice for this Derro-filled scenario.\
  \ I also like the Onslaughts wildcard Monstrous, but I’d require that all of the\
  \ monsters have the Undead trait (you’ll need to find them before building locations).\
  \ If you’re playing on Legendary and haven’t increased # to 2, this scenario could\
  \ really use it since level 2 has a bunch of Undead.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ resolving a city chase\"></a> \n      <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Chase rules\
  \ can get a little wacky in both the RPG and ACG.</p> \n     </div> \n     <p>Scenario\
  \ 1D: Kingkiller is one of several ways we’ve run “chase” scenarios. In the RPG,\
  \ you often make choices about which way to go, such as “leaping between rooftops”\
  \ or “balancing on the plank that leads across” that let you use different skills\
  \ and mix up the difficulty of options. The location Rooftop’s power to choose between\
  \ two barriers whenever you encounter a barrier is entirely inspired by this mechanic.\
  \ This scenario can be pretty quick and easy, which might feel nice for anyone who\
  \ had a tough time with the previous scenario. </p> \n     <p>On the other hand,\
  \ if you’re looking for more of a nail-biter, I’d encourage at least one of two\
  \ modifications to this scenario to increase difficulty: First, remove the scenario’\
  s automatic closing from defeating the Fugitive. This means that you’ll have to\
  \ defeat a barrier to close each Rooftop location, and if you fail, closing will\
  \ require either emptying it or shuffling the Fugitive back into it. It really changes\
  \ up the feel of the chase. Second, when the Fugitive is defeated and is shuffled\
  \ into another location, I’d instead shuffle the Fugitive and a new barrier into\
  \ a stack, then shuffle each into a random location (different locations if possible).</p>\
  \ \n     <p>That’s more than enough for this blog. I can probably do Adventure 2\
  \ more succinctly, right?</p> \n     <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight:\
