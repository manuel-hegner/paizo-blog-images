  \ \n     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Yoon was only eight when\
  \ she learned of fire; the power to command and control flames awoke within her,\
  \ as it had within her grandmother, and her grandmother's grandmother before her.\
  \ Fire was a good friend to have, for Yoon was on a journey across Tian Xia, fleeing\
  \ her old home of Minkai and heading down the coast to Hwanggot, the land her parents\
  \ had left decades ago. Her flame kept her warm at night and protected her from\
  \ monsters and bandits, and she had friends she met along the road to teach her\
  \ survival and point her toward the next village or inn.</p> \n      <p>But on a\
  \ night trekking across Hongal, the cold winds blew down from the Crown of the World,\
  \ and even Yoon's flame wasn't enough to keep her warm. With precious little wood\
  \ to be found on the arid steppes, Yoon broke her wooden walking club in half and\
  \ set it aflame with a wave of her hand. It had been a gift from her parents, one\
  \ of the last things she had left of them, and though Yoon was loath to lose it,\
  \ she knew they would rather she be safe.</p> \n      <p>Sitting by the campfire,\
  \ Yoon thought of them. They had been immigrants in Minkai, with precious little\
  \ to sustain themselves. Her mother had been an explorer and a warrior, sacrificing\
  \ time with her family to bring good coin home from jobs on the road. Her father\
  \ had stayed home to work the fields and to take care of Yoon and her grandmother,\
  \ though he had aspirations of becoming a court scribe. But though they had little,\
  \ her family made sure Yoon's life was as happy as possible, providing a good education,\
  \ the freedom of childhood, and what little presents they could afford—her favorite\
  \ being a stuffed animal named Gom-Gom. Though the little toy was clearly stitched\
  \ together from what mismatched, discarded pieces of other dolls her parents could\
  \ buy cheaply, they had made it with love, and Yoon loved it in return (even if\
  \ one of his eyes had gotten stolen by the Risucho in the Forest of Spirits).</p>\
  \ \n      <p>When Yoon's mother fell in battle to monsters from the deep, her father\
  \ fell too into a great depression, increasingly ground down by the ill treatment\
  \ of a corrupt local government official. When Yoon’s father tried to organize a\
  \ resistance, he was cut down by soldiers, and Yoon would have been as well, had\
  \ her grandmother not protected her by summoning the flames, trading her life for\
  \ Yoon's safe future. Now, Yoon had only Gom-Gom left. But her grandmother had told\
  \ Yoon of uncles and aunts and cousins back in Hwangott, the land her family had\
  \ emigrated from. Yoon would find them.</p> \n      <p>As Yoon traveled south, she\
  \ grew into an experienced explorer, just like her mother had been. She fought off\
  \ oni in Chu Ye, evaded the fanatical Tidecallers in Wanshou, and protected merchants\
  \ from lingering spirits in the lands of Linvarre newly reclaimed from the ghosts\
  \ of Shenmen. Along the way, the etiquette and poise that her grandmother had labored\
  \ to teach Yoon fell away, replaced by a rugged survivalism, a brashness (and sharp\
  \ tongue) learned from traveling with all sorts of miscreants, and the unassailable\
  \ confidence of adolescence. </p> \n      <br clear=\"all\"> \n      <table class=\"\

  \ the city of Mallaru, Yoon reached the sea, and she was presented with a choice.\
  \ She could continue her journey on foot, passing through yet more armies, monsters,\
  \ and dangers along the road. Or she could board a passenger ship from the harbor,\
  \ making her way to Hwanggot safely. The old Yoon would have balked at a journey\
  \ across the water—it had almost drowned her in childhood and its monsters had taken\
  \ her mother. She hesitated, for long enough that the ship cast off and began to\
  \ disappear out of the harbor.</p> \n      <p>Yoon was tired. Her fear had cost\
  \ her a decade. A decade spent wandering Tian Xia, and while the journey had forged\
  \ her into the warrior she always wanted to become, it would keep her from her homeland\
  \ no longer. Why should it? There was water in her blood just as sure as there was\
  \ air in her lungs. There was metal and wood lodged forever in her skin from countless\
  \ scraps along her journey. There was earth under her nails from ten years on the\
  \ road. But above all else, there was fire in Yoon's heart—the fire of her family,\
  \ her strongest weapon and most steadfast ally, driving her to cross half a continent\
  \ to make her way home. </p> \n      <p>The heart is a gate, her grandmother had\
  \ said, and as the emotion gripped Yoon, she saw for the first time what lay on\
  \ the other side: a world of endless and purest flame, the Plane of Fire sharing\
  \ the tiniest of its embers. Yoon felt her connection to the realm surge with the\
  \ realization, and with it, her power. Fire overflowed, burning its way through\
  \ Yoon's body. An explosion bloomed, blackening the cobblestones.</p> \n      <p>Yoon\
  \ soared through the air in a trail of sparks, whooping with the joy of a teenager\
  \ flying for the first time. The harbor grew smaller underneath her, then held in\
  \ place as she reached her apex and gravity gripped her. Yoon refused to fall—she\
  \ had always loved heights. She summoned her flames anew, blasting herself higher\
  \ still, then again, shooting herself over the water toward the ship. She wasn't\
  \ the least bit tired. The Plane of Fire was inexhaustible, so why shouldn't her\
  \ flames be as well? Allowing herself to hang in the air one last time, Yoon aimed\
  \ herself at the ship and struck the deck like a shooting star, the morning mist\
  \ glittering in her waning sparks.</p> \n      <p>The ship would soon reach Yoon's\
  \ homeland, and Yoon would then have a new adventure to set off on. She would fear\
  \ nothing again.</p> \n      <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold; line-height:\
