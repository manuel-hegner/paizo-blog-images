  date\">Tuesday, July 5, 2011</p> \n   <p>If you've ever crawled out from the depths\
  \ of the Abyssal sea of Ishiar after battling Dagon and his infinite number of monstrous\
  \ creations for days on end, you may have an idea of what finals week of my last\
  \ quarter at Western was like. The stress was immense, and I'm just as confused\
  \ as you are as to what the Shadow in the Sea was doing in Bellingham, Washington.\
  \ Nonetheless, I emerged victoriousâ€”or at least alive. When I found out I got the\
  \ job for Pathfinder Developer at Paizo a few weeks later, it was like breaking\
  \ through the Outer Rifts and finding myself in Elysium. I'd done it! I'd finished\
  \ college and gotten the job and was now working in the same offices as the authorial\
  \ titans of roleplaying lore! Hooray!</p> \n   <p>I'd gotten a taste of what it\
  \ was like to work among the titans over a year ago, while I was Editorial Intern\
  \ at Paizo. I shared a cube with Crystal, and it was a bit quieter around the office,\
  \ and I was paralyzed most days with excitement and anxiety at the mere prospect\
  \ of being in the same building as all these writers whose names I had seen countless\
  \ times on the books among my shelves at home.</p> \n   <p>Now, I share a cube with\
  \ the editors, Judy, James, and Chris, and Wes says I'll be moving over to the developer\
  \ side in a while. It's not as quiet in the office, since the company's grown a\
  \ lot even since just last year, and there are a ton of new faces since I last stepped\
  \ foot in the building. It's exciting to work alongside both people I've worked\
  \ with before and those whose names I've only seen in print, and I'm looking forward\
  \ to contributing my humble services alongside these industry giants. They've got\
  \ me working hard already, and I'm currently concentrating on <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy8kgw\"\
  ><i>Faiths of Corruption</i></a> and the <i>Jade Regent Player's Guide</i>, which\
  \ are going to be totally sweet, let me tell you.</p> \n   <p>While my joining the\
  \ Paizo team is pretty exciting in and of itself (<i>I'm</i> excited anyway!), I\
  \ am also pleased to report that the <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/prd/\">PRD</a> has\
  \ been updated to include rules from both <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8hif\"\
  ><i>Bestiary 2</i></a> and <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8k8r\"><i>Ultimate\
  \ Magic</i></a>. Check it out!</p> \n   <p>Patrick Renie <br>Developer</p> \n  </blockquote>\
