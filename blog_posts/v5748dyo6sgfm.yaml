  \    </div> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Before letting the folks from the\
  \ Order of the Amber Die get their final thoughts regarding the Playtest out there,\
  \ I want to thank them for the heroic effort they made in getting this material\
  \ to all of us. It was great not only hearing about the play experience and seeing\
  \ the thorough data, but it was also amazing to gaze at the gorgeous pictures. So,\
  \ thanks to the Order of the Amber Die! Take it away, y'all!</p> \n    <blockquote>\
  \ \n     <p>In the Order, as with many role-playing groups, we hold several planning\
  \ sessions before beginning any major campaign or project. Of equal importance to\
  \ us, however, is having at least one session of reflection following each such\
  \ endeavor. These are fairly casual, with each of us taking turns going around the\
  \ table discussing our favorite aspects of an Adventure Path, in-game or out-of-game\
  \ problems we encountered, or even answering the usual list of discussion questions\
  \ our GM has written on a dry erase board. We also like to go through the photos\
  \ that didn't appear on the Paizo Blog or our social media, laughing at some of\
  \ the more candid moments from a project. By the end of a good session of reflection,\
  \ we've always got a list of improvements we want to make for next time. We're excited\
  \ to be able to share some of those reflections here, including several fun photos\
  \ of various aspects of our playtest experience.</p> \n     <p>Before reading these\
  \ reflections, it might be helpful to catch up on both our experiences and data\
  \ from our previous playtest blogs:</p> \n     <p><a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo670md?Order-of-the-Amber-DieDoomsday-Dawn-Playtest\"\

  \     <p><b>Sean:</b> Three-action economy</p> \n     <h2>GM Reactions</h2> \n \
  \    <p>Here I'll provide two common points addressed in my GM open surveys.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Very early on in the playtest, resonance seemed to establish itself\
  \ as one of the most significant new changes to the game. As a GM who witnessed\
  \ a dozen or more full campaigns during the 3.5/3.75 era, I saw plenty of examples\
  \ of the use and possible abuse of magic items and was excited from about the prospect\
  \ of a solution in the new edition. With the introduction of resonance, gone are\
  \ the days of buff stacks, quivers stuffed with <i>wands of cure light wounds</i>,\
  \ or saddlebags full of my favorite culprit from version 3.5: <i>wand of lesser\
  \ vigor</i>. Along with our custom initiative board, OAD even had our \"Buff Tracker\
  \ 2011,\" which will soon be gathering dust with some of our other defunct materials\
  \ from previous editions. We know full well what it did to our campaigns to employ\
  \ an overabundance of such magic, and while we still had a good time in those years,\
  \ I'm eager to see how the game plays with the addition of resonance. While we still\
  \ haven't seen the final version of resonance, I appreciated both the effort Paizo\
  \ made to provide balance with magic usage, and the courage it took to do so.</p>\
  \ \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20181220-WrapUp-3.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20181220-WrapUp-3_500.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \      <br> <i>Inside the \"Map Room\" of the Order's HQ, where parts 2 and 3 were\
  \ drawn.</i>\n     </div> \n     <p>After seven scenarios of observation, the Pathfinder\
  \ Playtest clearly established itself at our table as a game with a high amount\
  \ of mobility compared to the previous edition. The absence of universal attacks\
  \ of opportunity, coupled with the three-action economy, created a feel of fluidity\
  \ in the great majority of our combats. Just as it felt like no monster or character\
  \ could be cornered easily, it also seemed as if no one was truly safe in the back\
  \ ranks of the marching order anymore. Even the very concept of marching order felt\
  \ like a loose term, since once each character received their first three actions\
  \ in a combat, everything was up in the air. The game may have seemed a bit fast\
  \ at first—perhaps even scary—especially for the players whose combat routines had\
  \ been established for years. As the scenarios rolled on, however, I watched them\
  \ adapt and develop new tactics, eventually finding a comfortable existence within\
  \ the broader confines of the playtest's combat. This being said, there were actually\
  \ quite a few points throughout the playtest where battles broke the limits of the\
  \ standard 24\" x 30\" Flip-Mat. As such, I ran some of the applicable encounters\
  \ on different sizes of maps (36\" x 36\", 27\" x 39\", 30\" x 40\", and 40\" x\
  \ 60\"). In the end, the larger maps all felt more comfortable and better able to\
  \ accommodate the play found in the playtest, with 36\" x 36\" feeling near perfect,\
  \ and 40\" x 60\" being enjoyable but far more luxury space than necessary.</p>\
  \ \n     <h2>Player Captain Reactions</h2> \n     <p>I'll try my best to summarize\
  \ what all of the players have wanted to see addressed, as well as some of my own\
  \ reflections. (Matt, Player Captain)</p> \n     <p>One change that proved interesting\
  \ was the new critical success/failure system. Of course, the rules for critical\
  \ hits with weapons are different now, but the bigger change seemed to be critical\
  \ successes and failures for spells. Prior, the wildest fluctuations in damage during\
  \ a round seemed to occur from massive critical hits from x3 or x4 weapons (often\
  \ power attacking to boot). Now, the greatest variability seems to come from area-of-effect\
  \ spells where multiple enemies are forced to make saving throws. The variety of\
  \ effects from a critical success (usually no effect) to a critical failure (usually\
  \ double effect) is significant, and it made spells more interesting and unpredictable\
  \ throughout the playtest.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"\
  //cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20181220-WrapUp-4.jpg\"><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20181220-WrapUp-4_500.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n      <br> <i>A completely normal moment with Fumbus at the table.</i>\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>All of the players enjoyed the inclusion of hero points in\
  \ the new system, and we were fortunate to see the entire range of options for their\
  \ use. Most common, was to see one of our players toss two tokens into the center\
  \ of the table and go for a re-roll when it mattered (often a saving throw or special\
  \ attack). The act by itself amplified the emotion already present at the table\
  \ during an important roll. If Desna blessed the re-roll with success, there was\
  \ even louder rejoicing—but if not—the groans were that much deeper. Keeping an\
  \ eye on spellcasters throughout the playtest (I actually played five casters out\
  \ of six), it was fun to occasionally see someone throw down all three hero points\
  \ to gain an extra action, thereby casting two spells in one round. And of course,\
  \ every player at one time or another had a lone hero point stashed away, pocketed\
  \ to save their life. Perhaps the best part of hero points was that using one meant\
  \ having to describe your actions in a heroic light, and thereby made combat more\
  \ vivid and entertaining.</p> \n     <h2>Challenges</h2> \n     <p>We really wanted\
  \ to get a head start on the playtest in August before the two-week playtest windows\
  \ began, but because we needed to play everything with the most recently released\
  \ errata, we couldn't be too far in front and instead had to fit everything into\
  \ the scant two-week segments. There was a lot to cram into each of the many fourteen-day\
  \ cycles: learn new errata, make new characters, prep a new scenario, complete GM\
  \ surveys, player surveys, open surveys, compile data for the blog, select photos\
  \ from the previous session, then actual play took place, and we'd repeat it all\
  \ over again. For the final six weeks, our GM took to leaving his entire living\
  \ room set up as our playtest studio.</p> \n     <p>From the planning stage to this\
  \ final blog, our playtest experience lasted nearly six months. A lot can happen\
  \ to any role-playing group in that time: two of our members began different careers,\
  \ one prepared to welcome 170 new students on the morning after emerging from the\
  \ Tomb of Tular Seft, while another was helping their own young children adjust\
  \ to the demands of nursery school, and one of us even experienced the birth of\
  \ his first child, wishing us well as he headed for a daring new adventure. Yet,\
  \ the Order's commitment to each other over the years has always helped us work\
  \ through life's obstacles and see our campaigns to completion, and the playtest\
  \ was no different.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20181220-WrapUp-5.jpg\"\

  \      <br> <i>The Order running part two of the playtest at PAX Unplugged.</i>\n\
  \     </div> \n     <h2>Final Thoughts and Thanks</h2> \n     <p>A shout out goes\
  \ to <a href=\"http://bluetablepainting.com/\">Blue Table Painting</a>, who brought\
  \ our iconic miniatures (and the kraken) to life. Another goes to the skilled team\
  \ at <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Keltic-Greene-318426871574638/\">Keltic\
  \ Greene</a>, who love to build elaborate gaming studios in their spare time. A\
  \ warm thanks to Sarah McIlvaine, who sat with the Order at our high school lunch\
  \ table in the 90s, and still supports us by printing everything from high quality\
  \ maps to the character placards we used in the playtest. Lastly, it was both an\
  \ honor and a pleasure to have the Order be among the vanguard of this new era;\
  \ our deepest thanks go out to the community for their encouragement, our Patrons\
  \ for their support, and the staff at Paizo for their boundless efforts to improve\
  \ the game we so revere.</p> \n     <p>As we eagerly await future announcements\
  \ regarding the final version of Pathfinder Second Edition, the Order is closing\
  \ in on completing our 150th published adventure in 2019. 150 could likely be the\
  \ highest number of published adventures ever completed and would make a nice number\
  \ to retire on. Maybe we did consider it, but there are still too many dungeons\
  \ and too many adventures out there not to continue onward.</p> \n     <p>And continue\
  \ we shall.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20181220-WrapUp-6.jpg\"\
