  \ Event at PaizoCon 2011!</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Wednesday, April 13, 2011</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Are you attending PaizoCon 2011? (If not, tickets are <a href=\"/paizocon\"\
  >still available!</a>) If yes, have you thought about volunteering to run an event\
  \ at the show? What makes PaizoCon so great isn't just the interaction with the\
  \ Paizo staff or the ability to play in a staff-run game, it's also the ability\
  \ to sit and game with your fellow Paizo community members as well as <b>run</b>\
  \ a game for those community members! We're not beholden to a single system at PaizoCon.\
  \ Want to run a Pathfinder RPG one-off? Great! How about a board game slot where\
  \ you teach some folks your favorite board game ever? Also great! How about you\
  \ playtest an upcoming scene in your home campaign with a willing audience? Perfect!\
  \ There's no end to the ideas you could develop and run at PaizoCon 2011.</p> \n\
  \   <p>We're only taking event submissions until April 27, 2011 (2 weeks from today).\
  \ So post below in the following format:</p> \n   <p>Title:<br> System:<br> Short\
  \ Description:<br> Number of Players (Min/Max):<br> Character Level:<br> Pregens\
  \ Provided (yes/no):<br> Maturity Rating (Everyone (6+)/Teen (13+)/Mature (18+)):</p>\

  \ Society volunteers for PAIZOCON 2011! Volunteers will receive $10 in Paizo.com\
  \ store credit useable whenever they want to use it, for each slot they volunteer\
  \ for, plus an awesome volunteer package of product in addition to the attendee\
  \ bag o' goodies. (And I mean AWESOME! As in, we only had to drive it 3 miles from\
  \ our warehouse AWESOME. Like, we're really close to the show so we can bring really\
  \ cool stuff AWESOME!)</p> \n   <p>Look through the list below and email me the\
  \ games/slots you can volunteer for!</p> \n   <p>Here's where we need help:</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Friday 9:00 A.M. to 12:00 P.M.<br> Need: 16</p> \n   <p>Friday 12:00 P.M.\
  \ to 5:00 P.M.<br> Need: 16</p> \n   <p>Friday 6:00 P.M. to 11:00 P.M. (Grand Melee)<br>\

  \ 1:00 P.M. to 6:00 P.M.<br> Need: 16</p> \n   <p>Sunday 8:00 A.M. to 1:00 P.M.<br>\
  \ Need: 16</p> \n   <p>There are 6 slots in which we need volunteer assistance.\
  \ In order to get the goody bag mentioned above, you need to volunteer for a minimum\
  \ of 2. The more volunteers I get for these events, the more events we can run.\
  \ So please take some time to run one or two events and help Paizo and the Pathfinder\
  \ Society make this the best PaizoCon possible!</p> \n   <p>We hope to have the\
  \ event schedule live for sign-ups very soon. Details forthcoming.</p> \n   <p>At\
  \ this time we're only seeking volunteers from those who have purchased a badge\
  \ and plan to attend the show.</p> \n   <p>All volunteers can email me: hyrum.savage@paizo.com\
  \ with the subject line PAIZOCON 2011 Volunteer.</p> \n   <p>Hyrum Savage <br>Marketing\
