  \  <p class=\"date\">Monday, August 11, 2008</p> \n   <p>Ever since we started the\
  \ Pathfinder Chronicles Campaign Setting, I've been thinking about the stars. Sure,\
  \ developing the planet of Golarion is a blast, but what's <i>beyond</i> it? Look\
  \ at how many stories we've managed to tell (and are currently gearing up to tell!)\
  \ in just one region of one worldâ€”how many more could be out there on the eleven\
  \ planets and dozens of moons in just Golarion's solar system? More importantly,\
  \ how strange would they be? What dark mysteries and untold wonders reside on worlds\
  \ not bound by Golarion's rules of evolution and magic?</p> \n   <p>Unfortunately\
  \ for me, the stories weren't mine to explore. Publisher Erik Mona, though certainly\
  \ open to suggestions, had staked his claim early on the solar system. Though both\
  \ of us, as part of the <a href=\"/planetstories/\">Planet Stories</a> team, love\
  \ science fiction, his is a much pulpier view of the cosmos than mine. Where I saw\
  \ hard science, astronomy, and almost unfathomable cultures at all stages of technological\
  \ advancement, he saw Burroughs' war-torn Barsoom and Otis Adelbert Kline's lush\
  \ Venus, filled with hard-jawed warriors and beautiful princesses wearing scanty\
  \ moon-garments. Quietly, I shuffled my hopes of gas giants with floating sentient\
  \ jellyfish and tidally heated moons into my desk drawer and moved on.</p> \n  \
  \ <p>That is, until Erik got himself too busy with the Pathfinder Chronicles Campaign\
  \ Setting and needed somebody to cover for him.</p> \n   <p>The result is <a href=\"\
  /pathfinder/v5748btpy81to\"><i>Pathfinder</i> #14's</a> extensive overview of Golarion's\
  \ solar system. Through Erik's love of pulp-era sword-and-planet, and my own affinity\
  \ for hard SF, we came away with a compromise that I hope has something for everyone.\
  \ Whether you're into steam punk or cosmic horror, bug-eyed aliens or familiar faces,\
  \ our system has you covered. </p> \n   <p>Except for robots. Managing Editor Wes\
  \ Schneider has long since made it public knowledge that his primary goal in life\
  \ is to keep me from putting robots into our world all willy-nilly. (NOTE: There\
  \ may still be robots.)</p> \n   <p>In any case, from Bretheda to Eox, Aballon to\
  \ the Diaspora, I hope you enjoy the worlds we've created for you. To help give\
  \ you a taste of what's to come, here's the entry for Akiton, the Red Planet:</p>\
  \ \n   <blockquote> \n    <p><b>Akiton, the Red:</b> Colder and harder than Golarion,\
  \ Akiton is a planet of brave four-armed warriors, their lances and flechette rifles\
  \ gleaming against a backdrop of rust-red rock and sand. Monsters roam these cold\
  \ mountains and desolate plains, and tyrannical empires raise stark and beautiful\
  \ cities in the dried beds of ancient oceans. The tribes of the Shobhad-neh, 12-foot-tall\
  \ behemoths capable of wielding a sword in each of their four hands, are fiercely\
  \ territorial, and few sane creatures would challenge a single warrior girded in\
  \ his battle harness, let alone one of the warbands and raiding parties that constantly\
  \ redraw the giants' borders. Yet there are other races here as well: the timid\
  \ and crafty Ysoki rat-men, or the red-skinned lizardfolk who hunt the great sand\
  \ serpents with only crude spears and teeth. Perhaps strangest of all are the Contemplatives\
  \ of Ashok, into whose soft and throbbing brain-sacs the ether occasionally whispers\
  \ secrets of things past and those left to come.</p> \n   </blockquote> \n   <p>\
