  \    <p class=\"date\">Wednesday, March 9, 2011</p> \n    <p>With the Carrion Crown\
  \ Adventure Path finally unleashed, this seems like a perfect time to give folks\
  \ bold enough to venture into Pathfinder's most frightening campaign just a hint\
  \ of what's in store.</p> \n    <p>To start off, let's take a look at the volume\
  \ that kick-starts the terror: <a href=\"/pathfinderAdventurePath/carrionCrown/v5748btpy8ihy\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Adventure Path</i> #43: The Haunting of Harrowstone</a>. Of course,\
  \ you have Mike Kortes's foray into dread with the adventure itself, wherein the\
  \ PCs are all that prevent a spectral prison riot from spilling out from the fire-scarred\
  \ ruins of Harrowstone Prison and overwhelming the sleepy Ustalavic village of Ravengro.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Beyond the adventure, Kortes takes us onto the shadowed streets and into\
  \ the clustered homes of Ravengro, as peaceful and quiet a community as you're likely\
  \ to find in the Ustalavic county of Canterwall's rural countryside (which you learn\
  \ all the secrets of in <a href=\"/pathfinderCampaignSetting/v5748btpy8g75\"><i>Pathfinder\
  \ Campaign Setting: Rule of Fear</i></a>). This gazetteer gives GMs everything they'll\
  \ need to bring the adventure's setting to life, with all the details and insights\
  \ necessary to bring dread into the homes and hearts of the PCs and their newest\
  \ allies.</p> \n    <p>Next up is Brandon Hodge's treatise on the horrifying traps-meet-the-supernatural\
  \ threats known as haunts. Originally introduced all the way back in <a href=\"\
  /pathfinder/adventurePath/riseOfTheRunelords/v5748btpy8029\"><i>Pathfinder Adventure\
  \ Path</i> #2: The Skinsaw Murders</a> and refined in the <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8ffn\"\
  ><i>GameMastery Guide</i></a>, this has been our first opportunity to give sadistic\
  \ GMs a whole library of some of fiction's and film's most horrifying unnatural\
  \ effects. Fact is, Brandon gave us WAY more menace than a single article could\
  \ contain... but I'll get back to that in a few.</p> \n    <p>In a new series in\
  \ the Pathfinder's Journal I get to explore my favorite corner of Golarion from\
  \ a different vantage. This time around, Laurel Cylphra, a wastrel on the streets\
  \ of Ustalav's decomposing former capital, gets dragged into a tale of revenge,\
  \ wronged spirits, and terrors that could drive even a Pathfinder into retirement.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Finally, Adam Daigle and intern-turned-author Patrick Renie unleash denizens\
  \ of dread with the first in a horrific series of Pathfinder Bestiaries, with creatures\
  \ of classic terror like Spring-Heeled Jack, old monsters given terrifying twists,\
  \ new rules for haunted animated objects, an option for accursed characters with\
  \ the changeling, and others like the beheaded and ectoplasmic templates that still\
  \ leave me with a sinister smirkâ€”I can't wait to use some of these guys!</p> \n\
  \    <p>So, that's what's in store if you haven't already checked out <a href=\"\
  /pathfinderAdventurePath/carrionCrown/v5748btpy8ihy\"><i>Pathfinder Adventure Path</i>\
  \ #43: The Haunting of Harrowstone</a>. Now, for those of you who were patient enough\
  \ to stick with me this far, check out what's below. Like I said, Brandon's article\
  \ on haunts ran over the space we had allotted for it, but rather than trash that\
  \ awesome content, I've kept it safe and plan to dole out new haunts as each volume\
  \ of the Carrion Crown releases. So, for those of you looking for more menace to\
  \ throw into Harrowstone, here are a couple of new low-level haunts.</p> \n    <blockquote>\
  \ \n     <p><b>Fool's Flare (CR 2)</b><br> Many spirits resent the intrusion of\
  \ lights brought by the living into their dark domains, and exert a supernatural\
  \ influence on torches and lanterns to show their objections to the trespass of\
  \ torchbearers.</p> \n     <p><b>Fool's Flare CR 2<br> XP 600</b><br> CE haunt (10-ft.\
  \ radius)<br> <b>Caster Level</b> 2nd<br> <b>Notice</b> Perception DC 15 (to feel\
  \ a cold, unearthly draft)<br> <b>hp</b> 4; <b>Trigger</b> proximity; <b>Reset</b>\
  \ 1 day<br> <b>Effect</b> This haunt triggers a <i>pyrotechnics</i> spell on torches\
  \ or lanterns brought into its area. In some instances, torches flare brightly with\
  \ a blinding light before plunging the area into darkness, as per the fireworks\
  \ effect, but in others the light sputters and dies, the extinguished source giving\
  \ off a smoke cloud effect (save DC 13 versus secondary effects).<br> <b>Destruction</b>\
  \ A <i>daylight</i> spell cast in the area permanently drives out the haunt.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>Rolling Fire (CR 4)</b><br> Also known as a faeu boulanger, rolling\
  \ fire is a trapped soul that was lost in a tragic fire fatality. The haunt manifests\
  \ as a spectral sphere of ectoplasmic fire that seeks to scorch and burn the living\
  \ in a grisly reenactment of the conflagration that created it.</p> <b>Rolling Fire\
  \ CR 4</b>\n     <br> <b>XP 1,200</b>\n     <br> CE persistent haunt (30-ft.-radius\
  \ open area or marshland)\n     <br> <b>Caster Level</b> 4th\n     <br> <b>Notice</b>\
  \ Perception DC 15 (to smell burning flesh)\n     <br> <b>hp</b> 18; <b>Trigger</b>\
  \ proximity; <b>Reset</b> 1 day\n     <br> <b>Effect</b> The haunt appears as a\
  \ large ball of spiritual flame emitting agonizing screams. The haunt attacks the\
  \ first creature that enters its area as a <i>flaming sphere</i> spell (save DC\
  \ 13).\n     <br> <b>Destruction</b> Turning one's coat inside out confuses the\
  \ faeu boulanger and prevents attack. A knife must then be stuck blade-up in the\
  \ ground of the haunt's area; when the roaming spectre rolls over the blade, it\
  \ impales itself and is destroyed.\n     <p></p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Watch\
  \ this spot in the coming weeks for more haunts and other Carrion Crown previews.\
  \ But if you're still craving more info on the new campaign, be sure to check out\
  \ the free <a href=\"/pathfinderAdventurePath/carrionCrown/v5748btpy8j0q\"><i>Carrion\
  \ Crown Player's Guide</i></a> and the discussions constantly going on in the <a\
  \ href=\"/paizo/messageboards/paizoPublishing/pathfinder/adventurePath/carrionCrown\"\
  >Carrion Crown Messageboards</a>. There's already a ton of great stuff in those\
  \ threads for folks who want to make this campaign as horrifying as possible, and\
  \ for those less interested in turning up the terror in their adventures. But you\
  \ won't know until you take the first step, so knot up your courage and click any\
  \ of the links above to learn all about our newest terror... if you dare.</p> \n\
