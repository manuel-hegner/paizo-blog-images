              <p>No fewer than three songs echoed through Hide and the deer kami as they strolled past the vendors lining the streets of Kasai. Unseen drums shook the air, the bass felt as much as it was heard, while flutes and shamisen competed for the rest of the matsuri’s soundscape. Hide’s stomach gurgled, but the festival food they passed—fried chicken, grilled octopus, and omelet-wrapped sausage—were ill-suited to either of their diets.</p>
              <p><em>Ask her if she has one in green.</em>&nbsp;The deer kami’s words appeared in Hide’s mind, as if revealed by receding mist. Similarly, Hide realized they were standing in front of a stall festooned with colorful strings of flowers and staffed by a woman in gray robes.</p>
              <p><em>Nn. I will, Mister Kami.</em></p>
              <p><em>Because it’s my favorite color.</em></p>
              <p><em>Nn. I understand.</em>&nbsp;Hide turned to the flower vendor’s stall.&nbsp;<em>If you’d just allow me to—</em></p>
              <p>“Taking your pet for a walk?” murmured the vendor from beneath her mask.</p>
              <p>“No, he’s not a pet, he’s...” Hide trailed off as he realized the woman’s eyes were not on him. She snorted and turned her attention to Hide.</p>
              <p>“Apologies, sir. I was speaking to your companion.”</p>
              <p>“<em>I</em>&nbsp;was the pet?” Hide asked, barely holding his incredulity at bay.</p>
              <p>“What can I do for you, sir?” the woman continued, without missing a beat.</p>
              <p>“Do you have any green flowers?”</p>
              <p>“Not exactly, sir, but I could apply a treatment to some yellow ones. The string won’t stay fresh as long, but—”</p>
              <p>The kami pranced excitedly, hooves tippy-tappying in the dirt road. This time, the words he was trying to convey were completely unintelligible to Hide, though the sentiment was clear.</p>
              <p>“I think we’ll take one.”</p>
              <p>“Wonderful. I’ll just—”</p>
              <p>Whatever the vendor said next was lost as the kami’s words washed over Hide.&nbsp;<em>Tell her she doesn’t have to wrap it.</em>&nbsp;The vendor cocked her head slightly and paused gathering her supplies, waiting for her customers’ mental conversation to complete.</p>
              <p>“He wants to wear it?” the vendor asked.</p>
              <p>“He wants to wear it,” said Hide. “How did you know?”</p>
              <p>“Kami often have particular tastes,” replied the vendor. She tugged her mask up a little higher, then laid an ornament of yellow flowers across her table and started waving a wand over it. Blue and green sparks cascaded from her hand, so quickly and brightly that Hide jerked his head away and blinked rapidly. If the sparks caused the masked vendor any discomfort, she didn’t show it. Nor did she show the gold coins that appeared in her hand in a telltale subtle shimmer of transportation magic; they’d disappeared from Hide’s purse while he was blinded by the sparks.</p>

              <p>“May I ask,” Hide began, “Why are you dressed in gray while your stall is so colorful?”</p>
              <p>The vendor’s eyes sank slightly, and Hide realized the woman had been smiling under her mask until now.</p>
              <p>“Life everywhere in Minkai under the Jade Regent was... challenging. We all did what we had to do. And we don’t know what we’ll have to do next.”</p>
              <p>Hide was suddenly very aware of the gold chains adorning his robes. His purse felt wrong. The pause lingered too long.</p>
              <p>“I didn’t hurt anyone. I just... relocated things and information. Hence the dark gray,” the woman continued.</p>
              <p>“I understand. I’ve done similar things. I’m sorry for asking so indelicately.”</p>
              <p>“May I ask you a question, sir?” the vendor inquired.</p>
              <p>“Of course.”</p>
              <p>“Why are you a kami’s traveling companion?”</p>
              <p>“This place was all forest once, you know?” said Hide. “That’s a silly statement. I apologize. Obviously, this was once forest. Everything was forest at one time. I mean to say that my friend remembered this place as it was and wanted to return—to see what we humans had done with the space and the trees.”</p>
              <p>A smiling crinkle returned to the woman’s eyes. “How nice. I hope he’s not too put off by what he sees.” She paused and shifted her attention to the deer kami. It took a moment for Hide to realize the kami was mentally speaking with her once more.</p>
              <p>“That’s a very charitable view of humanity, Mister Kami. Thank you.” The merchant said. She faced Hide again. “Now, it’s my turn to apologize. He pointed out that you didn’t answer my question. Why do you follow the kami?”</p>
              <p>“Ah. You’re right. I didn’t,” Hide admitted. He looked to his companion somberly. “It’s something of my calling. After I traded in my sword for a political office, I found myself knowing too much to sleep soundly. I do not think the Empress will return the kami’s lands to them, but that doesn’t mean that kami like Green Rush here should have to stay confined to their forest.”</p>
              <p>“So, you’re a chaperone?” the vendor asked.</p>
              <p>“Something like that. Perhaps more of a bodyguard, truly.”</p>
              <p>Green Rush turned his head towards Hide, as the razor-sharp points of his antlers caught the light.&nbsp;<em>Truly?</em></p>
              <p>“A bodyguard in the same sense that a professional fighter needs someone to limit the danger to would-be aggressors,” Hide answered aloud.</p>
              <p>“I thought you said you put down your sword,” probed the vendor as she leaned over her stall’s counter, holding the newly green flower string out for Green Rush.</p>
              <p>“I don’t need to use a blade to defend, just as you don’t need to use your hands to collect payment.”</p>
              <p>The vendor’s eyes went wide, and she froze as Green Rush’s deadly antlers surrounded her hands. “I—” she started.</p>
              <p>“I’m not judging you.” Hide cut her off. “I told you I’ve done similar things. I’m not even upset. You’re doing something nice for our kami guest, making sure he has his favorite color. That’s more than most would do.” Hide lifted his pouch slightly, checking its weight. “Yes, that seems like a fair trade. And it will undoubtedly help you transition to a more... conventional vocation, yes?”</p>
              <p>“Yes. Of course, sir,” said the vendor, her relief reducing her voice to a mere whisper. She finished tying the flower string to Green Rush’s antlers, pushed herself upright, and regarded her customers once more. “Will that be all, honored guests?”</p>
              <p>“I think there’s just one more detail we need to take care of.”</p>
              <p>Beneath the vendor’s mask, a whimper started to form, despite Hide’s calm smile.</p>
              <p>“Could I get a receipt? I need one so I can file a reimbursement with the Empress’ government.”</p>
