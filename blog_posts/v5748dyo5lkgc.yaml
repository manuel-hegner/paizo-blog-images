  \ and a fan of nerd culture, I have been blessed in many ways for the past three\
  \ years. One way, and how some of you might recognize me, is that I was honored\
  \ to be part of a show called “Dragons and Stuff” all last year. It is now “Dragons\
  \ and Things,” and we play a homebrew campaign live on Friday nights for our dedicated,\
  \ wonderful fans. I am also blessed by playing Yukon Cornelius in the national tour\
  \ of “Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer, the Musical,” based on the the ani-magic movie,\
  \ every November and December. It is a blast. However, the drawback to having these\
  \ two exhilarating jobs is time constraints. I cannot do both at the same time.\
  \ But this year, I decided to combine my two worlds into an experience I will never\
  \ forget.</p> \n      <p>I knew I wouldn't be able to exist without Pathfinder for\
  \ two months. Playing consistently for so long ignited my passion for the story.\
  \ I loved being a PC and feared becoming the evil, soul-stealer that led the group.\
  \ But when Humble Bundle advertised their Paizo sale for Extra Life, I decided to\
  \ strap on my GM boots and give it a go. I scoured over books. I carefully plotted\
  \ who my first group would be. I dreamed of machinations of torment for my future\
  \ players. Most importantly, I devised a plan. I would get my cast mates of “Rudolph”\
  \ as excited about Pathfinder as I am and run my friends through an epic quest.\
  \ I knew it would be difficult, but when is GMing ever not difficult?</p> \n   \
  \   <p>Through rehearsals, I helped these new players through character creation\
  \ and backstory. Then it was time for my wife (one of those players) and I to pack\
  \ our lives into two bags and three carry-ons and venture forth. You can imagine\
  \ how hard it is to pack up the necessary equipment for Pathfinder as well as preparing\
  \ for a two month away-from-home endeavor, but we made it work. We arrived at the\
  \ airport, received quizzical looks for having a map sticking out of my backpack,\
  \ and were stopped by airport security to search my bag of d20s. Through all of\
  \ this, nothing was going to stop me.</p> \n      <p>I sat down at our first official\
  \ game in Fort Worth, TX, and felt prepared. I asked the front desk for an area\
  \ where a group could meet to play a game. They peered at one another with questioning\
  \ glances. To them, I looked like a bearded sack of trouble. As I saw their minds\
  \ about to say “no,” I clarified that it wasn't drinking games or anything nefarious\
  \ but to play a nerdy RPG. They heaved a sigh of relief, giggled slightly, and showed\
  \ me a nice room where we could play.</p> \n      <p>Preparing encounters was easy,\
  \ but I wanted the environment to be pristine. I played with lighting, something\
  \ that was surprisingly easy on the road. Once, I even brought down lamps from three\
  \ separate rooms. I adjusted the dimness of two corners of the room, completely\
  \ extinguished a panel of lights, and set the lighting above the table to a perfect\
  \ level where it would draw my players in without straining their eyes. I had my\
  \ iPad filled with important Paizo documents on one side, my phone with <a href=\"\
  http://paizo.com/companies/syrinscape\">Syrinscape</a> on the other, and beautiful\
  \ <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy8b4s?Pathfinder-Dice-Legacy-of-Fire\"\
  ><i>Legacy of Fire Pathfinder Dice</i></a>. The work was worth it when my players\
  \ arrived flabbergasted. It was time to unleash the <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy8osv?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Beginner-Box\"\
  ><i>Beginner Box</i></a> on my friends.</p> \n      <p>There are many interesting\
  \ problems that occur when you are playing a game without home-field advantage,\
  \ the first of which I learned that night. If you are not clear about the time frame\
  \ in which you plan to play, someone will come and kick you out of your beautiful\
  \ playing space. Tension mounted as a group of goblins trapped and disarmed twos\
  \ of the five PCs. The rest watched in horror as I scurried in for the kill, when\
  \ suddenly security barged in and told us we had been there too long and must leave.\
  \ So much for dealing with generous front desk staff. It was getting late, but we\
  \ couldn't end the session like that. We packed up the mat, dice, computer, iPad,\
  \ phone, character sheets, minis and GM screen and headed upstairs. Our rooms were\
  \ very small. It was difficult to fit everyone inside, and I could tell that the\
  \ delay had ruined the moment. Not to mention it gave time for the cleric to think\
  \ up <i>obscuring mist</i> and escape scot free. They were tired and the moment\
  \ gone. Yet, the story was all they could talk about the next morning. They were\
  \ so excited about the growth of their characters, the story that was unfolding,\
  \ and NPCs that they loved to hate. So, we decided to play again that night. We\
  \ had a four hour bus drive from Fort Worth to Austin, and we were ready.</p> \n\
  \      <p>We hopped from one location to the next playing games. We went from Austin,\
  \ in a room deemed “The Murder Room” due to the staff requiring that we be locked\
  \ in, to Fayetteville, Arkansas where we practically played poolside. We had days\
  \ of rest in between; after all, you cannot play a three hour session after three\
  \ shows of “Holly, Jolly Christmas” being sung into your face during the day. We\
  \ spent most of our time travelling by bus, extolling our tales to curious cast\
  \ mates, and late nights/early mornings would be filled with passerbys peaking their\
  \ heads into conference rooms to figure out what undead creature these strange guests\
  \ were</p> \n      <p>talking about. The game ravaged forward, and they ended the\
  \ <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy8osv?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Beginner-Box\"\
  ><i>Beginner Box</i></a> triumphantly. In my heart, I knew there was more story\
  \ to tell, so I continued their journey with a homebrew. But, many other cast mates\
  \ wanted a part of the tapestry I was weaving for their companions. It didn't take\
  \ me long to decide that I could multitask and take another group through the same\
  \ box. Afterall, I knew the module. How hard could it be?</p> \n      <p>On the\
  \ next bus ride, a particularly long travel day, I helped five brand new players\
  \ roll up characters, along with leveling up my five previous players on a bumpy\
  \ bus. I was exhausted, but I knew (due to time) that I should start right away.\
  \ They went to the closest game store to purchase dice, and when that store had\
  \ a terrible selection (as some small town stores do), they found a different one.\
  \ Honestly, it was all going swimmingly. One group played at nights whenever we\
  \ could sleep in the next day, while the other group would play the mornings on\
  \ those same days. I lost some sleep, but didn't care. My friends were having the\
  \ time of their lives. Unfortunately for me, the most distracting and frustrating\
  \ moments for both parties happened on each of their respective “last nights.”</p>\
  \ \n      <p>The second party, with minimal time, was able to get through the <a\
  \ href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy8osv?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Beginner-Box\"\
  ><i>Beginner Box</i></a>. It was in Columbus, Ohio, that their story, with me at\
  \ the helm, would close. I knew the game itself had gripped their attention and\
  \ they would want to continue to play, but Ohio proved to be difficult. The fanciest\
  \ hotel we stayed in was also the stingiest. They told me I could play in a private\
  \ dining room, yet withheld information that this room was actually public and the\
  \ doors could not be closed. They showed me to another group area (this one had\
  \ kids climbing over the chairs) and told me this was another option. After an hour\
  \ and a half haggling with the front desk, I was able to secure a room. They forced\
  \ me to pay for a cleaning fee, but the story was more important than a measly twenty\
  \ five dollars. It was an interesting situation to be in. Normally, I would feel\
  \ confident and prepared for a session, but this aggravation uneased me. In a moment\
  \ of clarity, I realized this night wasn't about me or my struggles. It was about\
  \ their tale. When we ended, emotions around the room were high. Blood was spilled,\
  \ characters died, and heroes formed.</p> \n      <p>The original party felt similar\
  \ sensations, but the situation was much different. With the tour ending, we played\
  \ our last session in a LaQuinta check in/breakfast nook in Abilene, Texas. This\
  \ group took their characters from Texas to Alabama, Michigan, Wisconsin and many\
  \ other states only to end up in Texas again. The perfect moment arose in game.\
  \ The sorceress walked slowly around the spirit of her deceased husband as he revealed\
  \ the true nature of her djinni bloodline. As I was about to drop the bomb, a disheveled\
  \ man barged to the front desk complaining about water pressure in his room. Later\
  \ an elf laid unconscious at the feet of a bearded devil as the group slowly backed\
  \ away from the deadliest villain they faced. With his evil intentions made clear,\
  \ he struck the rouge with a coup de grace. The players jaws dropped. And they jumped\
  \ with surprise as the front desk staff clambered about cleaning the coffee machine.\
  \ Obviously, this was not an ideal situation, but I had already learned this lesson.\
  \ The words flowed from my mouth without fear or hesitation of what these other\
  \ guests or staff thought. The rest of the world dissipated as I sat with my friends\
  \ at a real table that now existed in an imaginary world only we inhabited. The\
  \ players cried, laughed, died, rose again, and defeated the enemy.</p> \n     \
  \ <p>In the same sense, I defeated my own enemies. I had many fears when deciding\
  \ to GM, especially in such a unique situation. The fear of telling pure strangers\
  \ that I was playing an RPG in their hotels lived in me. The fear that I could not\
  \ adequately perform the story was real. The fear that I was not good enough existed.\
  \ In the end, all fears fell away as I learned that you don't need to be perfect\
  \ to do this. You don't need the perfect map or the perfect knowledge. You don't\
  \ even need a quiet, secluded space. You need people who are willing to dive in\
  \ with you and swim in the deep end.</p> \n      <p>I guarantee that more of my\
  \ friends are interested in playing. They haven't told me so, but I know that they\
  \ are out there. I refuse to let time get in my way, to let my fears drive me away\
  \ from something I love. As GMs, we are duty-bound to tell stories to players who\
  \ are interested. And if doing two or three shows a day, traveling on a bus to a\
  \ new city or state every night, and living out of a suitcase didn't stop me, what's\
  \ your excuse?</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p><i>Ben Burch</i><br>Twitter/Instagram\
