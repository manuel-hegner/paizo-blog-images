  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">The\
  \ next set of <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids\">Pathfinder Battles</a>\
  \ prepainted plastic miniatures, <a href=\"/products/btpy96kb\">The Lost Coast</a>,\
  \ revisits the land of Varisia, the setting of several Pathfinder <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath\"\
  >Adventure Paths</a> and other sourcebooks. As we've show in previous previews,\
  \ this gives us the opportunity to fill in a few gaps from previous sets like <a\
  \ href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/riseOfTheRunelords\">Rise of the Runelords</a>\
  \ and <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/shatteredStar\">Shattered Star</a>, but\
  \ tidying up old set lists and satisfying my OCD and completionism is not the main\
  \ goal of the set.</span></p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <p>The main goal of <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy96kb\">The Lost Coast</a> is to provide great monsters and adversaries\
  \ for \"traditional\" Pathfinder campaigns. After a sojourn to other worlds in <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy92s9\">Reign of Winter</a> and a jaunt up to the demon-lands\
  \ of the Worldwound in <a href=\"/products/btpy91pu\">Wrath of the Righteous</a>,\
  \ we were in the mood for something decidedly mainstream. </p>\n    <p> </p>\n \
  \   <p>And it's difficult to get more mainstream than lizards!</p>\n    <p> </p>\n\
  \    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71576_GiantFrilledLizard.jpg\"\
  > <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71576_GiantFrilledLizard_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Up first this week is the Giant Frilled\
  \ Lizard, a terrible foe from the pages of the <a href=\"/products/btpy8auu\"><i>Pathfinder\
  \ RPG Bestiary</i></a>. With an unusual yellow/gold hide and an extremely dynamic\
  \ pose, this Large lizard is enough to make your player characters drop their own\
  \ tails in terror! The Giant Frilled Lizard is a Large, uncommon figure.</p>\n \
  \   <p> </p>\n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71576_ForestDrake.jpg\"\

  0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>As a creature type, drakes have really come into\
  \ their own in Pathfinder. They offer a great lower-level alternative for dragon\
  \ encounters, and it doesn't hurt that almost all of them have received fantastic\
  \ illustrations over the various Pathfinder Bestiaries. As far as \"sets\" go, drakes\
  \ are one that I absolutely want to complete. We've already done the <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy93om\">Frost Drake</a> and <a href=\"/products/btpy93on\">Rift Drake</a>,\
  \ and more are on their way. This set presents the Forest Drake, from page 107 of\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy8hif\"><i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2</i></a>. I love the\
  \ way the Forest Drake leans forward into a menacing pose. His tail and horns echo\
  \ the forest motif of his artwork, resulting in a very dynamic little dragon! Actually,\
  \ he's not very little at all, dominating his Large base. The Forest Drake is an\
  \ uncommon figure.</p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71576_MedBrassDragon.jpg\"> <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71576_MedBrassDragon_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Pathfinder Battles finally cracks into\
  \ the goodly metallic dragons with this Medium Brass Dragon! Based directly off\
  \ of artwork by Ben Wootten, this little guy would be right at home standing next\
  \ to a player character paladin or a good NPC you don't want your players to tangle\
  \ with. It has a very naturalistic pose and great sculpt detail. The Medium Brass\
  \ Dragon is a Medium, rare figure.</p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <p>And that's it for this\
  \ week's previews! Join us next week as we reveal more figures from the <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy96kb\">Lost Coast</a> set! Until then, please consider setting up\
  \ an <a href=\"/products/btpy8o6b\">ongoing Pathfinder Battles Case Subscription</a>\
  \ to make sure you don't miss a single figure!</p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <p>Erik Mona<br\
