  \ class=\"PTales\"></div></a> \n   <h1>Mother Bears</h1> \n   <p>by Wendy N. Wagner</p>\
  \ \n   <h2>Chapter One: Waking the Bear</h2> \n   <p>Kran tapped his slate, louder\
  \ this time, and Jendara gave in, looking up from her ledger. The boy's blue eyes\
  \ gleamed as his chalk squeaked, underlining the word \"please\" a second time—\
  his equivalent of begging. Jendara's lips moved as she read the note.</p> \n   <p>\"\
  You want to play marbles on the beach? With some village boys?\" </p> \n   <p>He\
  \ nodded his head, making the yellow tassels of his cap dance. The tip of his nose\
  \ was pink from the cold sea air.</p> \n   <p>She grunted. \"Just don't take too\
  \ long. Captain Vorrin wants to catch the outgoing tide, and that means all packed\
  \ up by sunset.\" </p> \n   <p>He swiped his slate with his sleeve, scribbled a\
  \ thanks, and then darted down the gangplank. Jendara's eyes followed him along\
  \ the pier until he cut over to the small strip of beach. She trusted Kran more\
  \ than most mothers trusted their eight-year-olds, but she liked knowing where he\
  \ was. He didn't get social invitations very often. There weren't many on the islands\
  \ who could read, or who'd go near a god-touched boy with no speech.</p> \n   <p>She\
  \ realized she was holding her quill too tightly, and put it down. Anyway, someone\
  \ was approaching the ship-turned-market square: a big man with the dung-crusted\
  \ boots of an island farmer. He reminded Jendara of her father, and she tried not\
  \ to smile at him. Bad enough being a woman in this business; it wouldn't do to\
  \ look soft.</p> \n   <p>\"You got something real heavy in that pack of yours.\"\
  \ She cleared the ledger and writing case off the table to make room for his wares.\
  \ She'd been buying lots of ivory and whalebone this trip—always in high demand\
  \ on the mainland—but whatever he carried in his pack looked soft. Furs, maybe.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"Ayuh. It's a load alright.\" The man dropped his bag with a thud that\
  \ made the table creak. He undid the knotted ties and the sack slid open, revealing\
  \ a pile of deep brown furs. </p> \n   <p>\"What did you catch?\" The fur felt sleek\
  \ and oily beneath her fingers, the hairs coarse. </p> \n   <p>He didn't answer\
  \ at first, working with the bag. Now Jendara could see that this great mass wasn't\
  \ a stack of pelts, but one magnificent hide, and her heart quickened. This could\
  \ be worth a lot of gold to the right buyer. </p> \n   <p>He began unfolding the\
  \ hide. \"It's big.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Grizzly?\"</p> \n   <p>\"Ayuh.\" He shifted\
  \ on his feet, frowning as he recollected. \"It was in with the sheep, killing anything\
  \ that moved. Had to protect my stock.\"</p> \n   <p>A paw hit the ship's deck,\
  \ and she could see claws longer than her own hand. She couldn't imagine facing\
  \ something so huge gone on a killing spree. \"How'd you kill it?\"</p> \n   <p>\"\
  Arrow through the eye. Then I jumped on its back and cut its throat.\" He'd uncovered\
  \ the head, well cured and massive, but marred by a white patch of fur like a lightning\
  \ bolt down the nose. \"Woulda kept it, but the wife said it was probably unlucky,\
  \ way it was acting. Figured you'd give me a fair price for it.\"</p> \n   <p>Jendara\
  \ mentally calculated a few figures. It was a good pelt, and she knew a dealer in\
  \ Magnimar looking for quality winter furs. She named her price, and the farmer\
  \ grinned hugely. He spat on his palm and stuck it out, just as her father had done\
  \ every deal he ever struck. She spat on her own and shook as fiercely as he did.\
  \ </p> \n   <p>\"We should drink. This deal is good for both of us.\"</p> \n   <div\
  \ class=\"blurb360\">\n    <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Yul.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Yul_360.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\
  \    <br> \"Yul is a typical islander—gruff and hard, but kind all the same.\"\n\
  \   </div> \n   <p>She looked out at the docks. No one else approached, and the\
  \ sun was already low in the sky. She doubted anyone further would be looking to\
  \ trade with her. \"All right.\"</p> \n   <p>Someone laid a hand on her shoulder.\
  \ \"You two mind a little company?\" </p> \n   <p>Jendara shrugged. She hadn't heard\
  \ Vorrin behind her, but wasn't surprised by his sudden appearance. Her husband,\
  \ Ikran, had asked Vorrin to look after her and Kran as he'd lain bleeding out on\
  \ the deck of a captured caravel. She couldn't hold it against either of them, much\
  \ as she wanted to. </p> \n   <p>\"You have a name, Bear Hunter?\" Vorrin put out\
  \ his hand. \"I'm Vorrin, captain of this ship.\"</p> \n   <p>The farmer's lips\
  \ thinned as he took Vorrin's measure. Vorrin's close-cropped black hair and thin\
  \ mustache were a strike against him here on the archipelago. His accent, city-fine,\
  \ didn't help. The farmer hooked his thumbs in his belt, a conspicuous rejection\
  \ of the hand. \"I am Yul.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Lead us to the nearest ale, friend.\"\
  \ Jendara stepped between the two men, hurrying Yul down the gangplank. She could\
  \ feel Vorrin's eyes on her back, and could easily imagine the irritated expression.\
  \ He abided the Ironbound Archipelago because she wanted to do business here, because\
  \ he loved his nephew and believed in keeping his word. But he didn't like this\
  \ cold, rough land.</p> \n   <p>The crunch of gravel beneath her boots made Jendara\
  \ smile. It had been one thing to leave the islands for the man she loved, but she'd\
  \ never felt right when she was away. Here the stone lay just beneath the tough\
  \ heath, and the beaches were long stretches of gray rock and gravel. Even the land\
  \ was hard here. It went without saying that the people worked hard, fought hard,\
  \ and grew hard as frozen leather under the wind's cold buffeting.</p> \n   <p>But\
  \ business had been brisk in this town, and the wind a constant reminder that she\
  \ had a trade route to finish before the winter sea grew too rough for Vorrin's\
  \ ship, the <i>Milady</i>. Jendara hadn't taken a moment to visit the village. It\
  \ wasn't so different from the place where she'd grown up. The steep peaks of the\
  \ house roofs stood out from the green turf climbing up the walls, the houses themselves\
  \ snuggled down into the earth. They could withstand any storm, stay warm in any\
  \ gale—little tough houses for big tough people.</p> \n   <p>A donkey huffed at\
  \ her as they passed a lean-to where animals could wait out of the weather. Jendara\
  \ patted its shaggy head and then hurried to catch up as Yul pushed opened the nearest\
  \ door, releasing the pungent tang of peat smoke and spilled ale. </p> \n   <p>Jendara\
  \ stepped inside and was struck by the realization that she had been here before.\
  \ She could remember sitting at the little bar, rubbing oils into the backs of her\
  \ still-itching hands, tossing back drinks that burned her throat but eased the\
  \ fresh sting of the tattoos. She touched the back of her hand, the now-old ink\
  \ covered by fingerless gloves. She could easily imagine the black jolly rogers\
  \ beneath the wool, puffy and peeling as they had that night. So it must have been\
  \ the end of her first pirate tour, pockets loaded and a lust to prove herself filling\
  \ her heart.</p> \n   <p>Yul nodded at the barkeep, a shaven-headed man as broad\
  \ as Yul and just as bearded. The man filled three tankards in quick succession,\
  \ sliding them down the bar without a word. Jendara drank a long pull of the foaming\
  \ stuff.</p> \n   <p>\"Well, well, if it ain't the famous Jendara. I thought the\
  \ rumors of you turning respectable were gullshit, but look at you out here, drinking\
  \ with the farmers.\"</p> \n   <p>Jendara put down her tankard with deliberate softness.\
  \ She turned to face the voice—one of those nasty, thin voices she'd come to associate\
  \ with cowards. There was no point ignoring it: men like this only responded to\
  \ intimidation. She folded her arms across her sheepskin vest and let her ice-blue\
  \ eyes speak for her.</p> \n   <p>A short and dirty man stood in front of the nearest\
  \ table, where a knot of men sat drinking. The little man sneered. He wasn't a native—\
  the brown hair and narrow jaw, far too small for all his yellow teeth, proved that.\
  \ From the waves of fish stench wafting off his layered sweaters, she imagined him\
  \ a very minor pirate who made ends meet by fishing.</p> \n   <p>The worst kind\
  \ of pirate. The jolly rogers on the back of her hands felt suddenly hot, as if\
  \ Besmara, chief bitch and goddess of all pirates, agreed with Jendara's pronouncement.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>She peeled off her gloves slowly, letting everyone in the bar see the\
  \ tattoos.</p> \n   <p>\"Jenny, Jenny, Jenny.\" The weasely man took a swig of beer\
  \ and grinned down at her. She remembered him now. He'd once asked Ikran for a position\
  \ on their boat, and she'd had to throw him overboard when he didn't like Ikran's\
  \ answer. Gorg. That was his name.</p> \n   <p>Gorg's grin grew wider as he leaned\
  \ toward her. \"You still watching over that mute brat of yours?\"</p> \n   <p>The\
  \ jolly roger seemed to laugh as her knuckles connected with Gorg's face, splitting\
  \ the skin over his cheekbone with the force of the blow. He screamed and dropped\
  \ to his knees—not incapacitated, but going for his boot knife. Jendara lashed out\
  \ with her heel, launching the man backward across the room.</p> \n   <p>She hadn't\
  \ paid attention to other men at the table, but they must have been Gorg's friends,\
  \ because they exploded up from their seats, snarling. Men screamed. Knives hissed\
  \ free of their scabbards. Jendara laughed and slipped her axe free of her belt.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>The weapon's haft shook with its own mirth as she brought the blunt end\
  \ down on a man's skull, then jerked her arm backward, slamming the handle's butt\
  \ into another man's solar plexus. Both sailors dropped. Jendara looked around for\
  \ more, but Grog was already draped senseless across a chair, and the last of his\
  \ companions was currently dangling from Vorrin's fist, toes not quite touching\
  \ the floor.</p> \n   <p>The tavern door flew open, the low light of afternoon like\
  \ a lighthouse beam cutting through the thick air. A man stood framed in the doorway.\
  \ Jendara recognized him as Vorrin's first mate. Silence filled the room.</p> \n\
  \   <p>Vorrin released the man he'd been holding up by the sweater-front. The sailor\
  \ crumpled to the ground. \"Tam? Something the matter?\"</p> \n   <p>\"Ayuh.\" The\
  \ word reminded Jendara that Tam was a fellow islander. He hesitated in the doorway.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"Well what, man?\"</p> \n   <p>\"It's the boy.\" Tam stepped inside,\
  \ bobbing his head uncomfortably. \"I saw a whole group of lads come racing up from\
  \ the beach, laughing like loons. But Kran weren't with 'em.\" </p> \n   <p>Jendara\
  \ felt her knees go soft, and she put her hand down on the bar to steady herself.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"Looked down the beach, but there weren't no sign of the boy. Figured\
  \ we ought to go look for him.\"</p> \n   <p>Jendara sheathed her axe and moved\
  \ toward the door. Vorrin clapped his hand on her shoulder. \"Don't go off half-cocked.\"\
  </p> \n   <p>She shook his hand loose. \"I've got to find my son.\"</p> \n   <p>\"\
  No purpose going by yourself,\" Yul warned. \"Folks don't tolerate strangers around\
  \ here.\"</p> \n   <p>Jendara's lips thinned. She knew it was true—knew the close-knittedness\
  \ of islanders—but resented it anyway. \"He isn't like other boys. There's been\
  \ trouble other places.\"</p> \n   <p>Yul didn't ask for details, but opened the\
  \ door. \"I'll help you look for him.\"</p> \n   <p>Jendara nodded curtly, rage\
  \ boiling her veins, some of it residual, some of it the goddess's, and most of\
  \ it for anyone who might hurt her child. Beyond Yul's shoulder, a knot of sniggering\
  \ boys huddled under the lean-to where the donkey had waited. A growl bubbled up\
  \ in Jendara's throat.</p> \n   <p>\"You don't know they've done anything wrong,\"\
  \ Vorrin whispered.</p> \n   <p>But she did, just from their wicked laughter, their\
  \ covert glances. She did know, from the hush that fell over the little group as\
  \ they saw the strangers coming their way. A shiver of cold warning ran down her\
  \ spine. </p> \n   <p>One of the boys held a yellow tassel between his fingers.\
  \ A yellow tassel just like the ones she'd sewn onto Kran's hat.</p> \n   <p><b>Coming\
