  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Last week, we updated the\
  \ <a href=\"http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/encyclopedia/pfs2guide/\"><em>Guide\
  \ to Organized Play: Pathfinder Society</em></a>. While we understand the timing\
  \ of the update was unfortunate given my scheduled absence, we had a perfect storm\
  \ of available collaborators, convention schedules, staffer movement, and blog slot\
  \ vacancies. I’m passionate about my role as OPM, but I still need to take a breather\
  \ and I used a limited opportunity to do so. Today we’re trying to address some\
  \ of the feedback we received, in particular how to bring existing characters up\
  \ to date. We plan to continue the conversations as needed, so please keep constructive\
  \ criticism coming our way.</p> \n     <h3>Schools</h3> \n     <p>All characters\
  \ with points in Spells, Scrolls, or Swords remove the points and any benefits conferred\
  \ by their old School training. Then choose one of the five current options - Spells,\
  \ Scrolls, Swords, Generalist, or Field Commission and apply benefits as outlined\
  \ in the Year 2 Guide. Characters who choose Field Commission do not apply “extra\
  \ downtime” retroactively.<br> Characters with points in Field Commission remove\
  \ points but have no other changes.</p> \n     <h3>Fame/Boons</h3> \n     <p>Of\
  \ all the revisions, removing Boons/Fame is the biggest. We’ve gotten feedback for\
  \ quite a few years that Pathfinder Society is just too convoluted and confusing\
  \ to get going. After ten years of program adjustments and changes, the team agreed.\
  \ Many streamlines/improvements came with the Pathfinder (second edition) ruleset\
  \ and, as GMs of the campaign, organized play needed to lean into those changes.\
  \ We spent hours discussing what was integral to the Society and what we could trim,\
  \ and boon slotting/Fame was at the top of the trim list. The biggest reason is\
  \ that we had a way to move the math/learning curve to the backside and not make\
  \ it a 10-page section of the Guide. In an ideal world, we would have done this\
  \ at edition change. Unfortunately, it took Covid, no traveling, and the addition\
  \ of the OPA for us to have capacity to deep delve into revisions. So we decided\
  \ to do it before everything settled. There will be some growing pains, but on the\
  \ other side we should have a system that allows for customization for the players\
  \ that want it and can be ignored by players who don’t want to engage with the system.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>The conversion period has several phases. </p> \n     <ul style=\"\
  list-style-type:none;\"> \n      <li><b>Phase 1</b>: Fame Accrual. As of the start\
  \ of Year 2 (31 July 2020), scenarios/quests/bounties don’t grant fame. Any chronicles\
  \ issued between 31 July and 15 September that have Fame awards are grandfathered\
  \ in as accurate.</li> \n      <li><b>Phase 2</b>: Boon Purchase. As of 31 December\
  \ 2020, Fame boons can no longer be purchased.</li> \n      <li><b>Phase 3</b>:\
  \ Game Rewards rollout. Starting 1 October 2020, boons unlocked at the Liked level\
  \ are available for purchase. We will roll out Admired boons shortly and Revered\
  \ after that. The delay in rollout allows for OP developers to watch the interaction\
  \ between the boons and make sure we address any conflicts before adding another\
  \ level. Goal is to have all boons rolled out by 31 October.</li> \n      <li><b>Phase\
  \ 4</b>: Conversion. We are finishing a conversion system and will announce the\
  \ particulars within the next few weeks. We hoped to have it done already, but the\
  \ perfect storm above also caused issues here.</li> \n      <li><b>Phase 5</b>:\
  \ New Unlocks. We will continue to monitor the program, including purchases, and\
  \ may add new options at future points in the campaign.</li> \n     </ul> \n   \
  \  <p>There are two rules for Game Rewards tied to factions. </p> \n     <ol> \n\
  \      <li>Purchased Fame boons remain valid for use with the limitations in place\
  \ when they were purchased (only one Capstone boon, for example).</li> \n      <li>Boons\
  \ with the same name have the purchase limitations as listed on the Boon tab of\
  \ My Organized Play and play limitations as listed in the <em>Guide to Organized\
  \ Play: Pathfinder Society</em>.</li> \n     </ol> \n     <h3>Home Region</h3> \n\
  \     <p>Each character should choose a location as their home region. This can\
  \ be as granular as a city or as broad as a nation. The home region opens up language\
  \ options per page 432 of the <em>Core Rulebook</em>. Other rulebooks that have\
  \ language options follow the same access rules. Please note that Varki is a choice\
  \ if the region of origin is Land of the Linnorm Kings. A player can unlock other\
  \ regional based options through the World Traveler AcP reward.</p> \n     <h3>Other\
  \ Clarifications</h3> \n     <p>Bounties - These adventures are not part of the\
  \ Pathfinder Society line of scenarios/quests, but they are produced by the Organized\
  \ Play team. Thus we are able to auto-sanction them at time of production instead\
  \ of issuing sanctioning documents. It is our intention that Bounties run at Society\
  \ events are for PFS legal characters. GMs running Bounties outside of Society credit\
  \ can choose to run in PFS mode or Campaign mode. We’ll get this language updated\
  \ in the Guide shortly.</p> \n     <p>Learning Spells - Some members of the community\
  \ raised questions about how their cleric and druid characters could use the new\
  \ spells from the <em>Advanced Player’s Guide</em>. We’re happy to provide a solution!\
  \ Any prepared spellcaster can use the Learn a Spell activity to learn any common\
  \ spells they have access to from tutors at the Grand Lodge. This adds no additional\
  \ material cost beyond the standard cost for the Learn a Spell activity.</p> \n\
