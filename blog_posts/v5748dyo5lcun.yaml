  \ Veils Celebration</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Monday, November 21, 2011</p> \n\
  \   <p>The Jestercap <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lcs0\">blog and boon</a> seemed\
  \ well received last month so I decided to try out another holiday this month.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Seven Veils is mentioned on page 249 of <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy8ief\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: The Inner Sea World Guide</i></a>. We are advised\
  \ it is a celebration of brotherhood between all civilized races, marked by interracial\
  \ masquerade balls. I thought this seemed like a neat holiday and decided it should\
  \ be expanded upon.</p> \n   <p>Once again, creative Director James Jacobs wrote\
  \ the description the holiday, and you will find a special Pathfinder Society Chronicle\
  \ sheet you can download and apply to a Pathfinder Society character.</p> \n   <div\
  \ class=\"blurb180\">\n    <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderSociety/MasterSpy.jpg\"\

  \    <br> Illustration by Eric Belisle\n   </div> \n   <blockquote> \n    <p>Diversity\
  \ is a fact of life in the Inner Sea region—not only do numerous human ethnicities\
  \ mix and live among each other throughout the area, but races entirely separate\
  \ from humanity dwell there as well. It’s not uncommon to see elves brushing shoulders\
  \ with humans in marketplaces, gnomes working as merchants in dwarven settlements,\
  \ or tengus serving aboard ships mostly helmed by humans. Indeed, two of the more\
  \ widespread races in the Inner Sea region—the half-orc and the half-elf—are the\
  \ specific results of diverse unions.</p> \n    <p>The holiday known as Seven Veils,\
  \ which takes place on the 23rd of Neth in most realms found in the Inner Sea region,\
  \ is a celebration of this diversity—a time when social boundaries break down even\
  \ further in a day-long event filled with dancing, feasting, and courting. The evening\
  \ traditionally closes out with the Seven Veil masquerade, a ball wherein the participants\
  \ wear disguises that either hide their actual race and/or gender (often using minor\
  \ magical trinkets and spells) or specifically disguise these features as entirely\
  \ new characteristics. At the end of the ball, the participants remove their disguises\
  \ to their partners, often with unpredictable and sometimes delightfully awkward\
  \ results. Traditionalists and conservative minds often find the Seven Veils masquerades\
  \ to be scandalous or off-putting, yet they remain particularly popular in most\
  \ of the larger cities of the land.</p> \n    <p>Historians note that the original\
  \ \"Dance of the Seven Veils\" has a much different genesis than one promoting diversity—\
  the mysterious cult of Sivanah, goddess of illusions, mystery, and reflections,\
  \ is generally cited as the source of this festival, and indeed, worshipers of the\
  \ goddess (herself known as the Seventh Veil) count the 23rd of Neth as one of their\
  \ most sacred of days. What rituals the church of Sivanah performs on this date,\
  \ however, are unknown to outsiders, for the cult enjoys its secrets. This secrecy\
  \ has, unsurprisingly, given rise to all manner of sinister rumor, yet when Seven\
  \ Veils rolls around each year, its eager participants are quick to set aside rumor\
  \ in preference for the night’s fun and games.</p> \n   </blockquote> \n   <p>I\
  \ am interested in reading your thoughts, not only on Jestercap and Seven Veils,\
  \ but also on future holiday write-ups and boons. This is especially true in regard\
  \ to the various equinoxes and solstices.</p> \n   <p><s>Download the Seven Veils\
