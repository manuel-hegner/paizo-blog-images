  \ Online and the Emerald Spire</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Thursday, December 6,\
  \ 2012</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\"\
  >Our sister company <a href=\"http://goblinworks.com\">Goblinworks</a> is busy developing\
  \ Pathfinder Online, a sandbox-style MMORPG game based on the Pathfinder world.\
  \ In celebration of them raising $200k in the first week of their Kickstarter initiative,\
  \ and to thank our fans for their continued support, Paizo is thrilled to announce\
  \ today new reward tiers for the <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1675907842/pathfinder-online-a-fantasy-sandbox-mmo\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Pathfinder Online fundraiser</a>. These tiers add awesome new\
  \ content to the Pathfinder world, we're sure you'll agree!</span></p> \n    <p>The\
  \ biggest news, literally and figuratively, is the launch of the <i>Emerald Spire\
  \ Superdungeon</i>, what will become the largest official Pathfinder RPG dungeon\
  \ ever published. The <i>Emerald Spire Superdungeon</i> includes 32 pages of source\
  \ material detailing the area around Fort Inevitable, one of the starter towns in\
  \ the Pathfinder Online game. It will also add at least four, 8-page dungeon levels,\
  \ designed by Pathfinder superstars Richard L. Baker, F. Wesley Schneider, Wolfgang\
  \ Baur and James L. Sutter. The Superdungeon will be accompanied by the <i>Emerald\
  \ Spire Dungeons Flip-Mat Multi-Pack</i>, a set of Pathfinder Flip-Mats presenting\
  \ each dungeon level in tabletop miniatures scale.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\"\

  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>As the Kickstarter funding grows, so does\
  \ the Superdungeon. When the $250k sub-goal is met, I will come out of game design\
  \ semi-retirement to add an original dungeon level to the book. As each $100k sub-goal\
  \ is met thereafter, new levels by superstar designers will be added. By the time\
  \ the Kickstarter reaches its $1 million funding goal, the <i>Emerald Spire Superdungeon</i>\
  \ will encompass 12 dungeon levels in 128 pages, accompanied by 6 double-sided Flip-Mats\
  \ in the <i>Emerald Spire Dungeons Flip-Mat Multi-Pack</i>. But it won't stop there!\
  \ As additional stretch goals are met, the Emerald Spire will become even larger,\
  \ and the number of Flip-Mats will grow. </p> \n    <p>Also, a new RPG Print Pack\
  \ has been added to the Kickstarter reward tier. Backers at any pledge level can\
  \ get the RPG Print Pack for an additional $100 (plus $15 shipping outside of the\
  \ U.S.). The RPG Print Pack includes a hardcover print edition of the <i>Emerald\
  \ Spire Superdungeon</i>, which will feature an exclusive Kickstarter cover by Wayne\
  \ Reynolds; a print edition of the <i>Emerald Spire Dungeons Flip-Mat Multi-Pack</i>;\
  \ a print edition of the Pathfinder Tales novel <i>The Crusader Road</i> by Richard\
  \ L. Baker, and an Emerald Spire Campaign Cards game accessory.</p> \n    <p>New\
  \ WizKids Pathfinder Battles Miniatures will be added to the Pathfinder Online Kickstarter\
  \ as rewards for all of the Crowdforger backer levels, which start at $100. The\
  \ miniatures will all be drawn from the <i>Emerald Spire Superdungeon</i>, starting\
  \ with the Bloodbriar Goblin Raider. A second miniature, the Shadowfire Elemental,\
  \ will be unlocked when the Kickstarter reaches $300K, with additional miniatures\
  \ revealed for each $100K raised. This means that starting at $250,000, a new reward\
  \ will be offered for every $50K reached, alternating between new dungeon levels\
  \ for the <i>Emerald Spire Superdungeon</i> and new Pathfinder Battles prepainted\
  \ plastic miniatures!</p> \n    <p>With the success of this Kickstarter, Pathfinder\
  \ Online is targeted for a mid-2014 Beta. As stretch goals are reached beyond the\
  \ base funding level, this target date will move up as more resources are brought\
  \ to bear on getting Pathfinder Online finished. </p> \n    <p>The <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1675907842/pathfinder-online-a-fantasy-sandbox-mmo\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Pathfinder Online Kickstarter Campaign</a> is in progress and\
  \ concludes at 2:00 GMT on January 14, 2013. We look forward to your being involved\
  \ in the development of Pathfinder Online â€“ the voice of the fans will be at the\
  \ core of what we do, and we thank you for your support.</p> \n    <p>Lisa Stevens<br>\
