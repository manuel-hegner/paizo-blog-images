  \ our first big look at the Firebrands, a brand new organization premiering in the\
  \ <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01zt4?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Character-Guide\"\
  >Lost Omens Character Guide</a> (releasing in just a few weeks!). While new organizations\
  \ are fun, people familiar with the Age of Lost Omens will have lots of classics\
  \ to look forward to as well. Pathfinder has had plenty of iconic figures throughout\
  \ its history including our <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/tags/iconicEncounters\"\
  >iconic characters</a> like Seelah and Valeros, as well as the Gray Maidens that\
  \ featured on the back of the original Core Rulebook. Among some of these more memorable\
  \ figures are the Hellknights, the imposing paragons of law.</p> \n      <div class=\"\

  \ \n      </div> \n      <p>The Hellknights are a widespread organization that spans\
  \ the Inner Sea region, though many of its orders are located within Cheliax. At\
  \ its core, the organization is dedicated to enforcing and upholding law and order.\
  \ The Hellknights believe the letter of the law to be absolute and understand that\
  \ without a commitment to law, the world is under threat of succumbing to the terrors\
  \ of chaos and disorder.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20191920-rackhellknight.jpg\"\

  \ 13px;\">Illustration by Maichol Quinto</p> \n      </div> \n      <p>Hellknights\
  \ follow a massive set of laws and virtues known as the Measure and the Chain. The\
  \ Measure collects all of the countless laws and strictures that make up the Hellknights’\
  \ code. These laws take inspiration from the structure and order of Hell itself,\
  \ with many Hellknights seeing the order of Hell as something to aspire to and emulate.\
  \ The Chain presents the Hellknights’ most important virtues: order, discipline,\
  \ and mercilessness. Keeping these ideals in mind, the Hellknights seek out lawbreakers\
  \ and those who threaten the stability of order, punishing them to the utmost extent\
  \ of the law regardless of the crimes committed. Compassion of any kind leads to\
  \ anarchy and, as all are guilty of some infraction, no mercy shall be spared for\
  \ those who break the law.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20191920-godclawhellknight.jpg\"\

  \ who want to become Hellknights will have to undergo rigorous training to even\
  \ be considered for entrance into the Hellknights. This training is represented\
  \ in the form of the Hellknight armiger archetype, originally found in the <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/products/btq01zoj?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-World-Guide\">Lost Omens\
  \ World Guide</a>. Since every Hellknight has to be an armiger first, it’s a very\
  \ important archetype for would-be Hellknights. In fact, it’s so important that\
  \ we decided to expand on the archetype just a bit by providing new feats to support\
  \ it! Once you go through the process of becoming an armiger, you are faced with\
  \ the Hellknight Test in which you fight a devil in one on one combat. Succeed and\
  \ you become a full-fledged Hellknight. Fail and you die. Pretty simple. Once you\
  \ become a Hellknight, you have access to the Hellknight’s signature armor!</p>\
  \ \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20191920-hellknightplate.png\"\

  \ Bulk 4; AC Bonus +6; Dex Cap +0; Check Penalty –3; Speed Penalty –10 feet; Strength\
  \ 18; Type Heavy; Group Plate. Few armors in the entire Inner Sea region are as\
  \ memorable as the iconic Hellknight plate. While each order has their own flourishes,\
  \ Hellknight plate is instantly recognizable to any who know of the Hellknights.\
  \ Hellknights go to extreme measures to punish non-Hellknights who get their hands\
  \ on Hellknight plate, and the reward is not usually worth the risk, as the armor\
  \ is functionally similar to full plate.\"></a> \n      </div> \n      <p>The Hellknights\
  \ are not a monolith. Though every Hellknight follows the Measure and the Chain,\
  \ the organization is broken into several orders, each of which have a different\
  \ focus. The Order of the Chain (who were the stars of a recent <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgwo?Tales-of-Lost-Omens-Rat-Trap\"\
  >piece of fiction</a> by Liane Merciel) are dedicated to tracking down criminals\
  \ who have eluded the hand of the law, at least for the moment. The Order of the\
  \ Pyre instead focuses on rooting out religions, philosophies, and scientific endeavors\
  \ that could disrupt the status quo. The Hellknights have seven major orders, which\
  \ are detailed in the book as well as several smaller orders that feature brief\
  \ descriptions.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20191920-pyrehellknight.jpg\"\

  \ 13px;\">Illustration by Maichol Quinto</p> \n      </div> \n      <p>Characters\
  \ that become members of the Hellknights must join one of these orders in order\
  \ to become a full-fledged Hellknight. Because each order has a distinctive focus,\
  \ we wanted to provide options to characters that better represent their affiliation\
  \ with their respective orders. To that end, we created a new set of feats, Order\
  \ Training and Advanced Order Training, to allow Hellknight characters to gain unique\
  \ abilities that are only available to their order. Both of these feats are available\
  \ to Hellknights, Hellknight Signifers, and Hellknight armigers, so you can access\
  \ these abilities regardless of where you are along your career path. The Order\
  \ Training feat gives you lesser abilities, like the Order of the Nail’s ability\
  \ to ignore non-magical difficult terrain, while the Advanced Order Training gives\
  \ greater power, like the blessing available to members of the Order of the Godclaw.</p>\

  \ alt=\"Blessing of the Five, Greater Benefit. Concentrate, Divine, Healing, Manipulate,\
  \ Necromancy, Positive. Frequency once per day. You call out to the Godclaw to heal\
  \ your allies. You cast the three-action version of heal, heightened to a level\
  \ 1 lower than half your level rounded up. You can select up to four creatures in\
  \ the area to remain unaffected by the spell. You can instead use this ability to\
  \ bring a creature within 30 feet that has died within the last round back from\
  \ the dead. If you do, the creature is restored to 1 hit point and is doomed 1 for\
  \ 24 hours.\"></a> \n      </div> \n      <p>Unfortunately, we only had enough space\
  \ to get order abilities for the seven major orders. If and when we get a chance\
  \ to look at the Hellknights again (maybe in a book focused on Old Cheliax? Who\
  \ knows! Let us know if you want that!) we will get a chance to expand further on\
  \ the orders and provide new options. In addition to the above options, the book\
  \ provides details on the various ranks among the Hellknights, such as Maralictor\
  \ and Paralictor, as well as information on the Lictors of each of the Hellknight\
  \ orders. Of course, I would be remiss if I didn’t mention one of the biggest options\
  \ available in this book: the Hellknight and Hellknight signifier archetypes!</p>\

  \ \n      </div> \n      <p>Building off of the Hellknight armiger archetype, these\
  \ two archetypes allow Hellknight characters to reach their full potential. Hellknights\
  \ are fierce warriors clad in Hellknight armor and bringing about brutal justice\
  \ wherever they go. Hellknights are the big, tough combatants among the organization\
  \ and have different abilities to represent that, like the scaling of their proficiency\
  \ in Hellknight plate and attacks like the Blade of Law.</p> \n      <div class=\"\

  \ have witnessed breaking or disrespecting the law or otherwise acting disorderly.\

  \ chaotic. Whether or not the target is chaotic, you can choose to convert all the\
  \ physical damage from the attack into lawful damage.\"></a> \n      </div> \n \
  \     <p>Hellknight signifers on the other hand are more focused on spellcasting.\
  \ They typically provide support to other Hellknights on the battlefield, but are\
  \ no less dangerous and dedicated than their fellow Hellknights. Signifers wear\
  \ unique masks that in addition to being quite intimidating, also grant unique abilities.\
  \ For example, with the Signifer’s Sigh feat you gain darkvision and lessen the\
  \ effects of being dazzled, while Gaze of Veracity feat allows you to cast <i>glimpse\
  \ the truth</i> as a focus spell.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\

  \ Prerequisites spellcasting class feature, Hellknight Armiger Dedication, lawful\
  \ alignment, member of a Hellknight order, passed the Hellknight Test. You have\
  \ bolstered your force of will with the power of the Measure and the Chain. Upon\
  \ initiation, you receive a signifier mask, often devoid of eyeholes or other decorative\
  \ features. The mask doesn’t obscure your vision, though it makes it impossible\
  \ for others to see your eyes. While wearing your signifer’s mask, you gain +1 circumstance\
  \ bonus to Deception checks to Lie, Intimidation checks, and Deception DCs against\
  \ Sense Motive. You gain expert proficiency in Intimidation (or in another skill\
  \ in which you’re trained of your choice if you were already an expert in Intimidation)\
  \ as well as in your choice of Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion. Special:\
  \ You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats\
  \ from the Hellknight signifer or Hellknight armiger archetypes.\"></a> \n     \

  \ consider joining their ranks, make sure to read Amanda Hamon’s work in the Lost\
  \ Omens Character Guide. If you like the idea of playing a knight, but prefer to\
  \ focus more on saving the day and helping others rather than just brutally upholding\
  \ the law, consider checking out our preview of the Knights of Lastwall next week!\
