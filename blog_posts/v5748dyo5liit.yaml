  \   <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">This month\
  \ is exciting for a host of reasons. First, February marks the anniversary of when\
  \ I began working at Paizo, and I'll soon observe the conclusion of my third year\
  \ on the job. February is also when I first started playing <a href=\"/pathfindersociety\"\
  >Pathfinder Society</a> as part of a home group in Georgia six years ago, which\
  \ eerily makes this the point at which I have participated in the campaign for an\
  \ equal amount of time as a participant and volunteer as I have as an employee.\
  \ I plan on celebrating this curious milestone by continuing work on an exciting,\
  \ upcoming project for the organized play campaign—one I'll reveal soon enough!\
  \ In a more official sense, you'll note that both Linda and I are brandishing <a\
  \ href=\"/paizo/about/contact\">deadlier titles</a> that we trust will keep the\
  \ pugwampis at bay.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb180\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PZOPSS0509-Valais.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PZOPSS0509-Valais_180.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \      <br> <i>Illustration by Mathias Zamęcki</i>\n     </div> \n     <p>In other\
  \ news, we're also taking this opportunity to update the <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/about/additionalResources\"\
  >Additional Resources page</a> with material from both January and February. Linda\
  \ and I also investigated several inconsistencies the community has pointed out,\
  \ so you'll see some small changes to some books. Most of these are noting that\
  \ a familiar legal in one source is, in fact, legal in another source—and other\
  \ such nuances. We've also updated several of the adventure sanctioning documents,\
  \ including those for Pathfinder Adventure Path: Reign of Winter (some minor errors\
  \ that don't affect the Chronicle sheets), Pathfinder Module: Wardens of the Reborn\
  \ Forge (added a limit to an ability on the fourth Chronicle sheet), and Pathfinder\
  \ Adventure Path: Carrion Crown (added a limit to an ability on the second Chronicle\
  \ sheet). These changes are retroactive, and I have made a note of that on the Additional\
  \ Resources page.</p> \n     <p>This month we're also releasing two scenarios I've\
  \ wanted to deliver for a long time. The first is <a href=\"/products/btpy9hux\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #7-16: Faithless and Forgotten, Part 2: Lost Colony\
  \ of TaldorM</em></a>, a Tier 1-5 adventure that continues our three-part homage\
  \ to the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/hellRebels\">Hell's Rebels</a> and\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/hellsVengeance\">Hell's Vengeance</a> Adventure\
  \ Paths by sending the Pathfinders on a tour of southern Cheliax. This month the\
  \ PCs travel to Kharijite, the sliver of territory Cheliax seized from Rahadoum\
  \ over 500 years ago, to explore an archaeological site that shatters what we understand\
  \ of Taldan history. Sure, I'm as excited about Taldor as anyone else, but what\
  \ I've really looked forward to—ever since I learned that the Pathfinder Society\
  \ is an archaeological organization—is an archaeological adventure. I'm an archaeologist\
  \ by training, and it's always been a struggle to reconcile that archaeology can\
  \ be lots of fun in practice, yet the study of stratigraphy, potsherds, and meter-wide\
  \ trenches just doesn't translate well to a roleplaying game. It was while writing\
  \ the outline for Faithless and Forgotten that I realized this passion could finally\
  \ find a home. I entrusted it to RPG Superstar finalist Kalervo Oikarinen, and he\
  \ delivered an awesome adventure that highlights all the themes I wanted while maintaining\
  \ all the action and excitement we would expect from a scenario!</p> \n     <p>For\
  \ more than two years now, I've had player after GM after Venture-Captain approach\
  \ me and ask when we'd see the return of the fan-favorite NPC Valais Durant (featured\
  \ in <a href=\"/products/btpy92cj\"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #5-09: The Traitor's\
  \ Lodge</em></a>). I can confirm the answer is February 2016, with the release of\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9huy\"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #7-17: Thralls\
  \ of the Shattered God</em></a>, a Tier 5-9 adventure with special opportunities\
  \ for the Silver Crusade faction! The Fifth Mendevian Crusade has wound down in\
  \ our campaign's continuity, and Mendev has uncovered an ancient Sarkorian site\
  \ in the reclaimed land. Ever eager to document history, Venture-Captain Jorsal\
  \ of Lauterbury has asked a team of his more experienced agents to salvage the secrets\
  \ before Mendev settles the area. Curiously, though, Valais Durant has asked to\
  \ accompany the PCs. What does she sense about this site, and what will it reveal\
  \ about her past? Linda and I knew we needed an author well versed in our continuity,\
  \ tapped into the community's appreciation of Valais, and talented to do the story\
  \ justice. We're glad that Andrew Hoskins accepted the challenge and wrote such\
  \ a fun adventure that you can enjoy beginning this Wednesday.</p> \n     <p>John\
