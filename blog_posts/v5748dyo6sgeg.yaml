  ><em>Starfinder Character Operations Manual</em> Playtest</a> begins now!</p> \n\
  \    <p>This playtest focuses on three new classes for the upcoming <em>Starfinder\
  \ Character Operations Manual</em>, a sourcebook full of new character options that\
  \ is scheduled to release in late 2019. First up is the biohacker, a brilliant super-scientist\
  \ who analyzes their enemies and creates injections that can help allies or hinder\
  \ foes. Biohackers specialize in scientific fields of study and utilize a scientific\
  \ method that is either studious and methodical, or instinctive and improvisational—\
  the hallmarks of any good mad scientist! Next is the vanguard, a martial character\
  \ who excels in melee fighting and channels the entropic forces of the universe\
  \ to manipulate their surroundings, bolster themselves and their allies, and power\
  \ their devastating unarmed strikes. Finally, we present the witchwarper. This Charisma-based\
  \ spellcaster pulls from alternate realities to power their magic and alter the\
  \ environment and even nearby creatures to the witchwarper's advantage. This playtest\
  \ is your chance to get a look at early versions of these classes and have a hand\
  \ in their development before they hit shelves next year!</p> \n    <h2>Playtesting\
  \ the Classes</h2> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\">\n     <a href=\"/starfinderplaytest\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/StarfinderPoster_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>The <em>Character Operations Manual</em> Playtest launches\
  \ today, <b>December 3, 2018</b>, and runs through <b>January 16, 2019</b>. So how\
  \ can you help playtest these new classes? First, download the free PDF of the <em>Character\
  \ Operations Manual</em> Playtest from <a href=\"/starfinderplaytest\">starfinderplaytest.com</a>.\
  \ Then make up some characters using the new rules. We're most interested in feedback\
  \ from actual play, so it's best if you can get some friends together and play a\
  \ few sessions using the new classes. If possible, make up characters at different\
  \ levels to get a sense of how they work at different points in their careers. There's\
  \ no playtest adventure to go along with these classes—you can use them in existing\
  \ adventures like Starfinder Society scenarios or Starfinder Adventure Paths, or\
  \ in adventures or mock combats that you create yourself. It might be helpful to\
  \ take some notes during play, so you can remember your thoughts on the experience\
  \ after the game session. To gather the most useful data for this playtest, we ask\
  \ that you avoid using house rules and play these characters using only published\
  \ rules from the Starfinder RPG.</p> \n    <h3>Playtesting in the Starfinder Society</h3>\
  \ \n    <p>Players participating in the <a href=\"/starfindersociety\">Starfinder\
  \ Society Roleplaying Guild</a> can also join in the worldwide playtest. From now\
  \ until the playtest's completion, players can create unique custom characters of\
  \ levels 1, 4 and 8 to test the new classes with. These custom characters use many\
  \ of the same rules as pregenerated characters, though the Organized Play team has\
  \ slightly relaxed the rules in order to encourage playtesting these new classes.\
  \ Look for more information on the specifics in a follow-up Organized Play blog\
  \ post later today.</p> \n    <h3>Surveys</h3> \n    <p>Our primary means of collecting\
  \ feedback for the playtest is through surveys that we would like everyone participating\
  \ in the playtest to complete. There is one survey for each class, so please fill\
  \ out the survey for each class you play. If you get the chance to try out all three\
  \ classes, that's great! But it's okay if you can only play one or two of the classes—\
  just fill out the survey or surveys for those classes. Links to the surveys can\
  \ be found on the <a href=\"/starfinderplaytest\">playtest page</a>. Please make\
  \ sure you've filled out your surveys by <b>January 16, 2019</b>.</p> \n    <p>In\
  \ addition to responding via the surveys, you can engage with other players and\
  \ designers on the <a href=\"/community/forums/starfinder/playtest\">Playtest forums</a>,\
  \ discussing the new classes and possibilities for the future. While we want to\
  \ focus on actual play feedback, we're interested in hearing all of your ideas about\
  \ the classes. You can also join us on <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/officialpaizo\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Paizo's Twitch channel</a>. We host a live Starfinder stream\
  \ every Wednesday, where we talk about all things Starfinder—including the Character\
  \ Operations Manual Playtest.</p> \n    <p>What are your thoughts about the playtest?\
  \ Do you have any questions about the playtest process? Let us know in the comments\
