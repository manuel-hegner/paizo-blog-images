  \    <p class=\"date\">by Chris A. Jackson</p> \n    <h2>Chapter Four: A Matter\
  \ of Commerce</h2> \n    <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> <span itemprop=\"description\"\
  ><p>A nondescript wagon creaked down a dark street of the Inner City, the back piled\
  \ high with canvas-covered wares and the caravaneers perched on the seat and rails.\
  \ A single horseman rode beside the wagon, looking ill at ease in the saddle. The\
  \ wagon stopped just before entering a wide, curved avenue, across which loomed\
  \ an impressive stone mansion. To the casual eye, it looked just like one of the\
  \ dozens or hundreds of wagons that passed through Katapesh each day.</p></span>\
  \ \n     <p>It wasn't.</p> \n     <p>\"If the wizard I paid was any good, Celeste's\
  \ up there.\" Torius pointed to the tower atop the mansion.</p> \n     <p>\"Looks\
  \ like Brojanni's still up,\" Snick said from the driver's seat, nodding up at the\
  \ lights blazing through the upper windows.</p> \n     <p>\"That can't be helped.\"\
  \ It had taken four days to set this up; Torius was not going to let Celeste remain\
  \ prisoner one night longer.</p> \n     <p>A spiked wrought iron fence encircled\
  \ the place, inside which strode four human guards, each bearing a loaded crossbow\
  \ and the leashes of two snarling hyenas. </p> \n     <p>\"Don't like dogs,\" the\
  \ pirate beside Snick complained.</p> \n     <p>\"Shouldn't have to deal with them.\"\
  \ Torius nodded to the nearest guard. \"Him, however, you'll have to take out, or\
  \ he'll shoot me and you'll need a new captain.\"</p> \n     <p>\"And the downside\
  \ of that would be...\" Snick said with a grin.</p> \n     <p>\"Just get us set\
  \ up, Snick!\" Torius wiped his brow and checked his bag of tricks. His hands were\
  \ shaking again, blast it, and he couldn't stop sweating. He'd finally realized\
  \ the source of his symptoms: the absence of his navigator, or more precisely, her\
  \ venom, to which he apparently had become both inured and addicted.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>\"Here.\" Snick passed him a small bottle. \"Drink it.\"</p> \n     <p>\"What\
  \ is it?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Pesh brandy; it'll help the shakes.\"</p> \n     <p>He\
  \ wondered how much she knew about the origin of his shakes, then unstoppered the\
  \ bottle and took a pull, feeling its sweet warmth set his stomach afire. \"Thanks.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"Get ready.\" She glanced at the hourglass that synchronized them\
  \ with three similar wagons on parallel streets. \"It's almost time.\"</p> \n  \
  \   <p>Torius doffed his kaftan, revealing a stout harness over studded leather\
  \ armor. He took a bottle from his belt and downed the contents; Brojanni was a\
  \ poison master, so a preemptive cure seemed a good precaution.</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ crewmen pulled the canvas off of Snick's baby, already loaded with a special stone-biter\
  \ bolt. A long, light rope was threaded through the bolt's eye; one end they clipped\
  \ to the horse's saddle, the other to a heavy ring in the front of Torius's harness.\
  \ A second line, which was wound around a spring-tensioned drum bolted to the wagon,\
  \ they clipped to the back of his harness. This was a tensioning line; without it\
  \ he would be dragged right into the menacing fence.</p> \n     <p>\"You're sure\
  \ about all this, Snick?\" He took a deep, calming breath.</p> \n     <p>\"Trust\
  \ me, Captain.\" She gave him another grin, holding up the glass and gripping the\
  \ ballista's trip cord. \"I triple-checked everything. Ready?\"</p> \n     <p>\"\
  Hell no!\"</p> \n     <p>\"Too bad.\" Snick pulled the cord. The ballista cracked\
  \ sharply as it shot the bolt into the night. From adjacent streets, three more\
  \ bolts shot toward the mansion. Three of the four hit their marks, lodging deep\
  \ in the stone above the tower's highest window; one glanced off an embrasure and\
  \ fell. Their assault force had just been reduced by one quarter. </p> \n     <p>Torius\
  \ said a short prayer and snapped, \"Go!\" to the horseman.</p> \n     <p>The man\
  \ applied his spurs and the horse bolted back down the street, pulling the line\
  \ though the bolt's eye and yanking Torius from the wagon. He felt like he was being\
  \ torn in half; one rope pulled him forward while the tensioning line pulled him\
  \ back to keep the angle of his ascent above the deadly fence. As he cleared the\
  \ tines, he saw a guard below raise his crossbow, but a hail of bolts cut him down\
  \ before he could fire and Torius allowed himself to breathe. Glancing to his left,\
  \ he saw Grogul and Joss also ascending toward the window.</p> \n     <p>When his\
  \ feet were firmly planted against the window's narrow ledge, he unclipped the tensioning\
  \ line. Grogul and Joss arrived, the former grinning his tusky grin, the latter\
  \ looking pale but ready. </p> \n     <p>He had no doubt that Brojanni had some\
  \ type of ward on his tower windows, but this was where another of his preparations\
  \ came into play. Torius slipped out the wand he had purchased for this venture—\
  at a cost that made him nauseous when he thought about it—pointed it at the window\
  \ frame and whispered, \"Negate.\"</p> \n     <p>Nothing happened.</p> \n     <p>Three\
  \ possibilities flashed into Torius' mind: the wand was a fake and he would have\
  \ to hunt down and kill the merchant he'd purchased it from, the window had no enchantment\
  \ for the wand to dispel and he had just wasted a charge, or the wand had worked\
  \ and it was safe. Only one out of the three would get him killed, which wasn't\
  \ bad odds considering the stupidity of attacking a spellcaster in his own home.\
  \ He glanced at Grogul and shrugged.</p> \n     <p>\"Bah!\" The boatswain kicked\
  \ in the ornate leaded glass and swung through the opening. Torius followed, and\
  \ Joss came last.</p> \n     <p>As they rolled to their feet, he heard the sound\
  \ he had been dreading; the chanting of a wizard casting magic. He swept his wand\
  \ in an arc, looking for the source. There were myriad tables, cages, boxes, barrels,\
  \ shelves and alchemical apparatuses, but no wizard. Then he realized his mistake,\
  \ and discharged the wand in the direction of the wizard's voice.</p> \n     <p>Too\
  \ late.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb360\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500_EvilWizard.jpg\"\

  0\"></a> \n      <br>Brojanni learned a valuable lesson about dealing with pirates.\
  \ Or perhaps not.\n     </div> \n     <p>Lightning cracked out of thin air, blasting\
  \ Grogul against the wall. Torius leapt to the attack, wand in one hand, sword in\
  \ the other, as Brojanni winked into visibility. Before he could close the gap,\
  \ the wizard cast a handful of dust before him and began another spell, but Torius\
  \ was ready this time.</p> \n     <p>\"Negate!\"</p> \n     <p> Nothing happened.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Torius grinned and advanced.</p> \n     <p>The wizard threw a vial at\
  \ his assailants' feet, and it burst into a noxious cloud. The acrid vapor stung\
  \ Torius' eyes and nose, but he felt no other ill effects. Chalk one up for the\
  \ pre-emptive cure, he thought triumphantly.</p> \n     <p>Torius and Joss stepped\
  \ forward, swords poised to strike.</p> \n     <p>Brojanni backed against the door.\
  \ \"How dare you invade my home, you damned pirate!\"</p> \n     <p>\"How dare you\
  \ steal my navigator, you trite bastard!\" Torius shot back. \"Tell us where she\
  \ is and you live.\"</p> \n     <p>\"I didn't steal your pet naga, Captain. Your\
  \ own first mate did that for me. I am <i>not</i> going to hand over my property\
  \ to a common thief, and my guild will have your head if you kill me.\"</p> \n \
  \    <p>\"And <i>my</i> guild will have <i>your</i> head for arranging her kidnapping!\"\
  \ Torius placed the tip of his cutlass against the man's chest. \"Now, hand her\
  \ over.\"</p> \n     <p>Brojanni's face abruptly softened from a sneer to a smile.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Captain, please, we're both businessmen. The naga's venom is all I\
  \ want. When mixed with refined pesh, it makes an interesting poison. I expect to\
  \ make a fortune from it. A fortune we could share.\" He raised his hands in submission.\
  \ \"This is simply a misunderstanding in a delicate matter of commerce. I see no\
  \ reason why we can't reach a mutually beneficial agreement with no guild involvement.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"Like what?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Sell me her venom! If you sign a contract\
  \ to bring me regular shipments, I'll give you the naga.\"</p> \n     <p>Torius\
  \ opened his mouth to tell the wizard what he could do with his contract, then heard\
  \ distant shouts from beyond the door.</p> \n     <p>\"Those are my guards, Captain,\
  \ and I daresay there are more than you can oppose. Decide quickly!\"</p> \n   \
  \  <p>Torius's mind raced. \"Five hundred gold per ounce, six ounces per month,\
  \ guaranteed.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Three hundred and ten ounces per month.\"</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"Four hundred and eight per month.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Done!\"</p> \n  \
  \   <p>Torius lowered his sword. \"Where is she?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Just behind that\
  \ wall, Captain.\" Brojanni produced a key from his sleeve.</p> \n     <p>\"Joss,\
  \ see to Grogul. We just made a deal.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Aye, sir!\"</p> \n     <p>\"\
  This way, Captain.\" Brojanni stepped to the shelf-lined wall. He moved a pot and\
  \ fit the key into a hole. Silently, the entire wall swung out.</p> \n     <p>Inside,\
  \ Celeste lay restrained by an iron collar chained to two bolts in the walls. The\
  \ room was crowded with other devices and a table laden with vials of pearly white\
  \ liquid. </p> \n     <p>She rose on her coils, her dark eyes wide. \"My captain!\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"Release her!\" Torius's hand began to sweat on his sword hilt.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Captain, please. The monster is dangerous without the enspelled collar.\
  \ Let me place a charm on it for our protection.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Fine. Do it now.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>Torius tensed as the wizard cast his spell, then stepped over and\
  \ touched the iron collar; it glowed briefly and fell away. \"Your owner has come\
  \ for you, Celeste. You can go with him as soon as we sign a simple contract.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"Of course,\" she said, slithering submissively after them.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Back in the outer room, Brojanni bent over his desk to gather paper\
  \ and quill. Torius sidled over next to Celeste and aimed his wand.</p> \n     <p>\"\
  Negate!\" he whispered</p> \n     <p>This time, something happened.</p> \n     <p>Celeste\
  \ coiled and struck, sinking her fangs into Brojanni's neck. He reeled, and again\
  \ she bit him, hissing with rage. The wizard fell against the desk, and she sunk\
  \ her fangs into his chest, flexing her powerful body before releasing him. Brojanni\
  \ slumped to the floor, gasping for breath, his skin nearly as pale as Celeste's.\
  \ Once more, she reared back, ready to strike.</p> \n     <p>\"Celeste! Enough!\"\
  \ Torius stepped forward, but she turned and hissed at him.</p> \n     <p>\"This\
  \ man...\" she seethed, \"this <i>beast</i> chained me and kept me from seeing the\
  \ stars! He forced me to trade my venom for a mere glimpse of the sky! I'll have\
  \ him dead!\"</p> \n     <p>\"Wait, Celeste! Please. It's complicated. We can't\
  \ kill him. It'll start a guild war.\" He stepped between them and turned to give\
  \ her a secret wink. \"In fact, I'll need to give him the antidote to your venom\
  \ right away.\" He turned to Brojanni and handed him a large flask. \"Drink this.\
  \ It'll ease the poison. Quickly!\"</p> \n     <p>The wizard took the flask and\
  \ drank greedily, then slumped back. His hand dropped to the floor, releasing the\
  \ flask as his eyes glazed over with forgetfulness.</p> \n     <p>Celeste hissed\
  \ angrily. \"You...you mean to let him live? After what he did to me?\" She lashed\
  \ her tail. He'd seen her agitated before when she'd been too long from the stars,\
  \ but never this bad.</p> \n     <p>\"At least he won't remember it.\" Torius looked\
  \ down at the man's slack face. \"Trust me, if I could kill him, I would. Do you\
  \ have any idea how much that elixir he just gargled was worth?\"</p> \n     <p>\"\
  We gotta go, Captain!\" Grogul rumbled. He and Joss were busy barricading the door.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Grogul! You okay?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Bah! Nothin' but a little burn.\"\
  \ He brushed charred leather away from the healing scar on his chest. \"Joss fixed\
  \ me up. But we better get before this door gives way.\"</p> \n     <p>\"We've got\
  \ to go, Celeste. Now! I'll make it up to you.\" He pulled out a potion vial and\
  \ held it while she drank. He heard Joss gasp as she morphed into a beautiful nude\
  \ woman, but he didn't have time to deal with that right now. He draped a cloak\
  \ across her shoulders and the four of them dashed for the window.</p> \n     <p\
  \ align=\"center\">∗ ∗ ∗ </p> \n     <p>The stars shone like jewels overhead as\
  \ <i>Stargazer</i> sailed beyond the glow of Katapesh. Torius stepped out onto the\
  \ deck, his hands behind his back. Celeste was coiled at the rail, gazing up and\
  \ swaying sinuously with the roll of the ship while the crew tended to their duties\
  \ around her.</p> \n     <p>\"For you.\" Torius held out an exquisite sextant wrought\
  \ in bright silver.</p> \n     <p>Celeste's smile gleamed as she floated it out\
  \ of his hands. She peered through the lens and hissed with delight. Leaning close,\
  \ she nipped his neck; the faint rush of weakness and euphoria was like a breath\
  \ of sea breeze, and Torius sighed.</p> \n     <p>\"You must have done well with\
  \ the sale of the Gods' Tears to afford such an instrument,\" she said.</p> \n \
  \    <p>Torius looked around guiltily to ensure that none of the crew stood within\
  \ hearing, then whispered, \"Actually, after paying the crew and buying that, the\
  \ money's mostly gone. We've got to find a rich merchant ship if we're to keep in\
  \ provisions.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Then I will find one for you,\" Celeste agreed,\
  \ turning her face to the night sky. \"And the stars will be our guide!\"</p> \n\
