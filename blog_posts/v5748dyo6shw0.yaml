  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Welcome, Archivists. I’\
  m James Case, here for your debrief on the playtest for <em>Pathfinder Dark Archive</em>!\
  \ First, thank you all for taking the time to try out the psychic and the thaumaturge\
  \ and for filling out surveys, talking about the classes on forums and chat servers,\
  \ making blog posts and videos, and all in all helping us make the classes the best\
  \ we can be! Now that the playtest has wrapped, we wanted to talk about some of\
  \ the feedback we saw and the directions we’re starting to take class revisions.\
  \ While we’re still in the middle of discussions, development, and analysis, we\
  \ thought we’d check in. Keep in mind that both classes will get a ton of small\
  \ updates across the board, as well as more feats, class path options, and the like,\
  \ so we’re just going to focus on the big changes here! </p> \n     <h2>Psychic:</h2>\

  \ psychics\"></a></td>\n       </tr> \n      </tbody>\n     </table> \n     <p><b>Main\
  \ Takeaways:</b>We tried something a little different from the conventional spellcaster\
  \ model with the psychic’s lower number of spell slots and strong focus on …focus...\
  \ cantrips, amps, and other special powers, with conventional slotted spells filling\
  \ a more supplemental role. The overwhelming majority of you responded that you\
  \ preferred this approach over a conventional spellcaster approach; however, much\
  \ of the feedback also indicated that while what the psychic got in exchange for\
  \ this reduced spell loadout was very interesting, it didn’t feel powerful or useful\
  \ enough to make up for the difference in lost spell slots. So, a major direction\
  \ of change for the psychic will be to retain the “fewer spell slots” and “cantrip/amp\
  \ focus” class role, but adjust the power level of the supplemental pieces so that\
  \ you can truly feel like you’ve unleashed the awesome power of your mind. I’ll\
  \ get into some of the approaches we’re taking in each point below.</p> \n     <p>We\
  \ also wanted to get a sense in the playtest of what you all thought of the general\
  \ tone and genre of the class. This was pretty conclusive—over two-thirds of respondents\
  \ said the more magical cast was working for them, so we’ll be staying the course\
  \ here as well!</p> \n     <p><b>Spells and Spellcasting:</b> A strong majority\
  \ of respondents stated that they preferred the playtest arrangement of the psychic’\
  s spellcasting and key ability scores, so we’ll be sticking to those and keeping\
  \ the psychic as a spontaneous occult spellcaster whose subconscious mind gives\
  \ them a thematic choice of key ability score between Intelligence and Charisma.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>I also want to call out that, as with past spellcaster playtests, the\
  \ specific spells granted on the conscious minds drew only on spells we had already\
  \ published, so some needed to be chosen for role (“a damaging spell here” or “\
  a scouting spell here”) and easy understandability even if they were a little outside\
  \ the theme—for instance, <em>magic missile</em> was a stand-in for a more on-theme\
  \ damaging level 1 spell on the distant grasp psychic. The final <em>Dark Archive</em>\
  \ book will introduce several new spells with the psychic in mind for thematically\
  \ tighter granted spells!</p> \n     <p><b>Psyche:</b> The ability to unleash your\
  \ psyche to amp spells for free was originally intended to let psychics really feel\
  \ like they got to be masters of focus by cheating the Focus Point caps. However,\
  \ the fact that psychics had almost unlimited Focus Points took up a lot of the\
  \ power budget for the class, rippling into the psyches needing to come online later\
  \ and have both benefits and drawbacks, as well as affecting the power of amps (which\
  \ I'll touch on next). Therefore, one of the biggest changes we’ll be making to\
  \ psychic is to remove this aspect of Unleash Psyche, and then redistribute that\
  \ power through the rest of the class for a more consistent play experience. </p>\
  \ \n     <p>Consistent feedback also showed that while psyches were interesting\
  \ when unleashed, most combats didn’t last long enough after the third turn to make\
  \ getting into the psyche feel worthwhile (meaning that much of the psychic’s power\
  \ was tied up in a feature they had inconsistent access to). While we don’t want\
  \ to make Unleash Psyche an “assumed first-turn action” in the vein of Rage, Hunt\
  \ Prey, or similar, we do want to make it easier to do. Thankfully, with the removal\
  \ of psyche’s role as a source of unlimited Focus Points, we have a lot of options\
  \ for making it more accessible, as well as for adding more punch, such as effects\
  \ that happen when your first Unleash your Psyche, more special abilities that happen\
  \ automatically when you are unleashed, or the ability to end your psyche earlier\
  \ for a single big benefit.</p> \n     <p><b>Amps:</b> Amps are one of the major\
  \ parts of the psychic, and most respondents stated that they found these options\
  \ very interesting—Mark tells me that amps scored among the highest for “interesting”\
  \ of any class we’ve playtested—but also that they felt weak in comparison to normal\
  \ focus spells. They were! Since Unleash Psyche meant that you could amp your focus\
  \ cantrips 5 or more times in a single combat, as opposed to a hard maximum of 3,\
  \ those amps needed to be a little under the balance point of spells like <em>fire\
  \ ray</em>. While psychics will retain their focus on amps, they likely won’t have\
  \ such an outsized number of them, so we have plenty of room to now bring the power\
  \ scale of amps back up.</p> \n     <p><b>New Stuff!:</b> Of course, we always increase\
  \ the number of options between the playtest and the final class! In addition to\
  \ the new spells that will be added in Dark Archive, the psychic will of course\
  \ be gaining new feats and choices of both conscious and subconscious minds. In\
  \ honor of our new iconic psychic, Thaleon, I’ll share his conscious mind, which\
  \ is called the tangible dream. This path focuses on materializing and projecting\
  \ the user’s thoughts into the physical world, allowing you to conjure walls, blades,\
  \ and other constructs of force (or astral thread, or ectoplasm, as your character\
  \ concept fits) around the battlefield!</p> \n     <p>I’m getting a vision… It’\
  s… of Mark, talking about the thaumaturge!</p> \n     <br> \n     <h2>Thaumaturge:</h2>\

  \ Mark Seifter here for a post-playtest report for the thaumaturge class. I first\
  \ want to thank you all for participating in the playtest by running and playing\
  \ games, posting your playtest results and analysis, answering surveys, and having\
  \ good discussions! In particular, the playtest was happening during a pretty challenging\
  \ period for us at Paizo, and I appreciate how all of you in the playtest stepped\
  \ up your game compared to earlier playtests with extremely civil discourse, keeping\
  \ repetitive points to a minimum so I could keep up with all the new ideas, and\
  \ just really engaging with each other’s ideas and feelings in good faith to talk\
  \ about different directions. </p> \n     <p>Overall, people really liked the thaumaturge,\
  \ with a strong good feeling from the majority of players, but there were definitely\
  \ some areas where it needed tweaking or rethinking, usually in a way that didn’\
  t detract much for most playtesters but did in a big way for a small number of them.\
  \ This left the thaumaturge in an interesting situation, with about as many people\
  \ who were about as many huge fans of the class as the highest-ranking class we’\
  ve ever playtested, but then that small number with especially low rankings. The\
  \ great news about that is that it left a clear path forward. </p> \n     <p><b>Main\
  \ Takeaways:</b> The one thing I wasn’t sure about was whether playtesters would\
  \ like our new vision of the thaumaturge or would prefer something more similar\
  \ to the first edition occultist. What I discovered is that you really like the\
  \ martial thaumaturge concept, by an overwhelming majority, and want it to remain\
  \ a magpie picking up from all four traditions. However, there was a desire to make\
  \ it clearer how the class fantasy works with respect to exerting your force of\
  \ personality to convince the universe, as well as to add more capacity to the class’\
  s skills so that Charisma-based skills are front and center to match the intro lore\
  \ about being persuasive. The changes to Esoteric Antithesis and Find Flaws (see\
  \ below) may help with this as well to allow better advantage of your Charisma key\
  \ ability score, while freeing up a broader variety of character concepts—this will\
  \ let players freely choose whether to lean more heavily on magical learning or\
  \ more on making things up as you go along as best fits the character. We’ll also\
  \ be making a variety of quality-of-life changes based on other playtester proposals.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>New Implements:</b> As the playtest mentioned, we’ll be adding up\
  \ to nine implements (three each granting active, reactive, and passive abilities).\
  \ Of the four new implements, one of them will be the tome (or a ledger, notebook,\
  \ or similar object), a passive implement that mysteriously writes down information\
  \ about everything around you to assist you. The other implements are one to let\
  \ you inspire and lead your allies, one to debuff your enemies, and one that misleads\
  \ your enemies’ attacks, but I’ll leave it up to you to figure out what implements\
  \ those might be!</p> \n     <p><b>Esoteric Antithesis and Find Flaws:</b> One thing\
  \ I’ve learned from these playtests is that our playtesters tend to be our most\
  \ dedicated and experienced players (and even if you’re new to Pathfinder, you are\
  \ very experienced with tabletop RPGs in general). So, whenever even our most experienced\
  \ playtesters think a mechanic is complicated, I think I should take another look\
  \ at that. People loved the benefits for these abilities but thought they were complex,\
  \ and that they sometimes had issues being tied directly to Recall Knowledge. Our\
  \ plan is to disentangle Esoteric Antithesis from Recall Knowledge (with a feat,\
  \ like investigators’, to pick up a free Recall Knowledge if you want that), instead\
  \ just flat-out forcing your will on the universe with a check to establish a connection\
  \ (I’m thinking a name like “Forge Connection”). One consequence of this is that\
  \ even on a failure, you can forge a connection, but a success or critical success\
  \ will give you more. Additionally, while a high majority of players really liked\
  \ the playtest benefit from Esoteric Antithesis, there were some good ideas about\
  \ how to open up to allow a variety of benefits to allow for more playstyles. So,\
  \ we’re looking at offering multiple benefits a thaumaturge can pick from when you\
  \ successfully forge a connection. This separates out the benefit where you apply\
  \ a creature’s highest weakness and the benefit where you create a new weakness\
  \ as two options, to handle the feedback people gave about situations where they\
  \ were already applying a creature’s highest weakness due to preparation for the\
  \ encounter. It also allows you to gain new benefits, for instance, when you might\
  \ prefer a special buff or debuff instead of simply more damage. Right now, we’\
  re toying with the idea of having a different connection for each implement, as\
  \ some folks also thought implements could use one more unique power, and then have\
  \ more connections available through feats</p> \n     <p><b>Pacts:</b> People loved\
  \ the story of the pacts—in fact, they wanted them to have stronger effects, and\
  \ many wanted the option for any character, even non-thaumaturges, to gain them.\
  \ We had actually planned on including similar pacts in a yet-unannounced part of\
  \ the book, but based on your feedback, we also expanded the pacts into a full-on\
  \ pact binder archetype for anyone to take! Opinions were pretty varied about their\
  \ rarity, perhaps the most mixed we’ve ever gotten in a multiple choice question\
  \ for paths moving forward, so we’ll take that into account moving forward.</p>\
  \ \n     <br clear=\"all\"> \n     <h2>A Glimpse, A Hunch, A Flicker of the Future:</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>Hey, thanks for sticking around! Here’s something coming up in <em>Dark\
  \ Archive</em>—while the book is still in development and various things might change\
  \ a little, I wanted to give a sneak peek into a new type of player option coming\
  \ up in the cryptids file, one of the eight casefiles of the <em>Dark ArchiveM</em>.</p>\
  \ \n     <h3>Creature Echo Feats</h3> \n     <p>Creature echoes are a new type of\
  \ feat that grant you special powers based on exposure to an unusual creature. These\
  \ are rare and usually only occur after a significant event involving the creature.\
  \ Imagine a town where people have, one by one, begun to turn to stone. You might\
  \ spend many months tracking down the cause of the phenomena, only to eventually\
  \ find it was an ancient creature with a petrifying gaze living deep under the town.\
  \ However your encounter with the creature goes, the following feat might echo with\
  \ you if you survive:</p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p><b>Stone Skin — Feat 12</b><br>\
  \ Rare, Transmutation<br> <b>Prerequisites</b> You have been petrified.</p> \n \
  \     <p>It might have been a medusa, dracolisk, or even a fossil golem; regardless\
  \ of the source, you were the target of some petrifying effect, and an element of\
  \ that stony gaze has remained with you, both protecting and slowly consuming you.\
  \ Your limbs are coated with a layer of stone that rests atop your skin. You gain\
  \ a stone fist unarmed attack which deals 1d8 bludgeoning damage, has the shove\
  \ trait, and is in the brawling weapon group; unlike a normal fist, it does not\
  \ have the agile or finesse traits. As your life force ebbs, this petrification\
  \ spreads over more of your body to form a stony armor. When you have fewer than\
  \ half your maximum Hit Points, your stone fist unarmed attack increases its weapon\
  \ damage die from 1d8 to 1d10 and you gain resistance to physical damage equal to\
  \ your Constitution modifier. </p> \n      <p>If you would gain the dying condition,\
  \ you can choose to instead be permanently petrified to avoid the risk of death.\
  \ Counteracting this petrification requires a casting of <em>stone to flesh</em>\
  \ of a spell level equal to at least half your level, as well as a counteract check\
  \ against the hard DC for your level. Each time you recover from petrification caused\
  \ in this way, you gain a new scar on your skin in the shape of a long, thin crack.</p>\

  \ go, I want to say thanks to the awesome writers whose work is featured in the\
  \ book. We’re in the middle of development and I gotta say, they’ve done some strange,\
