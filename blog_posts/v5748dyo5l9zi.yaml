  \ Traits</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Monday, June 23, 2008</p> \n   <p>In the first\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderCompanion\">Pathfinder Companion</a>, the <a href=\"\
  /store/v5748btpy81x7\">Player's Guide</a> to the Second Darkness Adventure Path,\
  \ we introduce a new mechanic for tying your character's background and history\
  \ into the gaming world as a whole. These are Character Traits, a concept we first\
  \ introduced in the Curse of the Crimson Throne Player's Guide, where the trait\
  \ you pick gives you not only a small bonus to your character, but ties him or her\
  \ into the Adventure Path's storyline from the start. Starting with the Pathfinder\
  \ Companions, we're solidifying this system into something you can use not only\
  \ for Adventure Paths, but for any campaign.</p> \n   <p> At its core, a Character\
  \ Trait is approximately equal in power to half a feat—in fact, at one point, we\
  \ considered calling them \"Half Feats\" but abandoned that idea when we realized\
  \ it implied a point-based system that didn't really exist (there's no such thing,\
  \ for example, as a \"Double Feat\"). At the start of a new campaign, you can pick\
  \ two traits for your character—in effect, gaining a bonus feat that you tailor\
  \ from two different categories of options. Yet a Character Trait isn't just another\
  \ kind of power you can add on to your character—it's a way to quantify (and encourage)\
  \ building a character background that fits into the world of Golarion. Think of\
  \ Character Traits as \"story seeds\" for your background; after you pick your two\
  \ traits, you'll have a point of inspiration from which to build your character's\
  \ personality and history. Alternatively, if you've already got a background in\
  \ your head or written down for your character, you can view picking his traits\
  \ as a way to quantify that background, just as picking race and class and ability\
  \ scores quantifies his strengths and weaknesses.</p> \n   <p>At the start, there'll\
  \ be 40 different basic traits to choose from (ten each, split over the categories\
  \ of Combat Traits, Faith Traits, Magic Traits, and Social Traits), along with six\
  \ Second Darkness specific traits (these'll be more like the traits we introduced\
  \ at the start of Curse of the Crimson Throne), but that certainly won't be the\
  \ end of the matter. The goal is to continue presenting additional traits in the\
  \ Pathfinder Companions to come—traits based on your character's race, homeland,\
  \ and religion. Eventually, the pool of traits you'll be able to choose from should\
  \ cover just about any type of character background you'd ever want!</p> \n   <p>One\
  \ more thing: Character Traits are for PCs. If a GM wants an NPC to have traits,\
  \ that NPC will need to \"buy\" them with the Additional Traits feat. Player characters\
  \ are special; they're the stars of the game, after all, and if they have an advantage\
  \ over the NPCs of the world in this way, that kind of makes sense. The pregenerated\
  \ characters presented in Pathfinder and the modules will not have bonus traits\
  \ selected for them—we're leaving those choices to you if you wish to use one of\
  \ them as a PC.</p> \n   <p>James Jacobs <br> <i>Pathfinder</i> Editor-in-Chief</p>\
