  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">“You\
  \ have sixty seconds to eject your stolen cargo before my gunners blast you out\
  \ of the sky,” Brigadier Tassada Kor barks into the comms, watching the battle from\
  \ her position on the bridge. The decorated vesk officer commands the dreadnought\
  \ <em>Talon’s Razor, crewed by</em> 435 stalwart souls loyal to the Veskarium, and\
  \ she did not tolerate pirates in her corner of space. The targets of her ire, three\
  \ smaller ships darting and wheeling in the viewport in front of her, spit lasers\
  \ as they arced close before speeding out of range of her vessel’s firing arcs.\
  \ The <em>Razor’s</em> hull shakes violently, sparks raining into the black as enemy\
  \ weapons slam into the shields. Tenacious opponents, Tassada admired them for it,\
  \ but their insolence must end. When Tassada directed her crew to the outskirts\
  \ of Veskarium space to investigate reports of piracy, she unintentionally kicked\
  \ a hornets’ nest of smugglers and their mercenary escorts. The vessels in her crosshairs\
  \ now were the last of the ragtag armada challenging the <em>Talon’s Razor</em>.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Tassada grins, feeling the thrum of the gatling cannons firing as her\
  \ gunners retaliated. A spray of cartridges slams into one of the enemy ships and\
  \ it explodes into bits of metal. Tassada wheels her mobility chair forward to better\
  \ focus her cybernetic eye on the wreckage. Aided by her augmentation’s magnification\
  \ capabilities, she quickly pinpoints a cluster of escape pods and a polycarbonate\
  \ cube stamped with the Veskarium’s official seal. </p> \n      <p>“That’s one way\
  \ to take back our cargo,” Tassada tells her crew, not bothering to switch channels,\
  \ wanting the remaining smugglers to hear. “Engineering, report.”</p> \n      <p>“\
  Our super orbital particle cannon is back online.” A male voice replies. Tassada\
  \ grips the doshko holstered to her chair in anticipation.</p> \n      <p>“What\
  \ are you waiting for?” She yells at the gunners. “Fire at will!” A blast of blazing\
  \ white light envelops the viewport, searing the image of disintegrating spacecraft\
  \ onto Tassada’s retina. </p> \n      <center>\n       <hr width=\"50%\">\n    \
  \  </center> \n      <p>“My crew easily overpowered the pirates near sector 5 and\
  \ are detaining survivors. Unfortunately, we were not able to recover all the stolen\
  \ goods,” Tassada explains. She taps a claw against the datapad, sending the report\
  \ off to her superiors. Needing a place to dock the heavily damaged dreadnought\
  \ for repairs, she heads to Spaceport 5.1. Encountering an electrical storm on the\
  \ approach means grounding the <em>Talon’s Razor</em> for some time, though being\
  \ this close to the satellite grants Infosphere access, and she decides to be prudent\
  \ and file her report while her crew lands the craft.</p> \n      <p>Tassada frowns\
  \ at an incoming transmission signal from her datapad. “Brigadier Kor, this is Command\
  \ 5. We received reports of a squad of pahtra insurrectionists absconding with a\
  \ cache of experimental weapons. They are suspected to be in this sector now. Track\
  \ them down and make sure the weapons don’t make it into the hands of the rebels\
  \ on Vesk-6.”</p> \n      <p>The brigadier growls at the thought of rebels stealing\
  \ Veskarium property while she idles in the spaceport. She scrolls through the station’\
  s secure feeds while composing an acceptable response to her superior. She stops\
  \ at a docking request from a Starfinder vessel. Scanning the associated records,\
  \ Tassada discovers the Starfinders docked at Spaceport 5.1 four days ago and just\
  \ completed repairs to their own ship. A working ship and a capable crew were all\
  \ she needed. </p> \n      <p> “It’s not over yet.” Tassada mutters as she heads\
  \ to the Starfinder ship. </p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
