  \ Unleashed: 10 Infernal Secrets</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Friday, July 10, 2015</p>\
  \ \n    <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Just in\
  \ time for the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/hellsRebels\">Hell's Rebels</a>\
  \ and Hell's Vengeance Adventure Paths, <a href=\"/products/btpy9b9s\"><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Campaign Setting: Hell Unleashed</em></a> hits later this month. For this entry\
  \ into the Unleashed series, Jerome Virnich and I broadened the book's focus to\
  \ encompass more than just dragons, just undead, or just any one creature type.\
  \ Instead, we investigate a spectrum of Hell's servants, be they immortal fiends,\
  \ damned mortals, or more terrible things in-between. Also expect a few other nasty\
  \ tricks you've never seen in an Unleashed book before.</p> \n     <p>So you're\
  \ as prepared as you can be for the coming blasphemy, here are 10 infernal topics\
  \ in <em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Hell Unleashed</em> that your party paladin\
  \ doesn't want you to read.</p> \n     <ol>\n      <li><b>Roads to Hell:</b> Before\
  \ you can face the horrors of Hell you have to get there. Learn more about gates,\
  \ spells, ferrymen, and talismans that provide direct routes to Hell—or that bring\
  \ it to you!</li> \n      <li><b>Manifestations:</b> Learn how to conjure forth\
  \ manifestations, new haunt-like dangers that allow divinities—both fair and foul—\
  to exert their wills upon the mortal plane. Along with these new rules you'll find\
  \ examples of foul miracles for all of Hell's archdevils, and more.</li> \n    \
  \  <li><b>The Book of the Damned:</b> Learn more than ever before about Golarion's\
  \ most infamous tome, <em>The Book of the Damned</em>, including its history, its\
  \ lingering masters, how to conduct research within the book, and the god-like being\
  \ that guards its secrets.</li> \n      <li><b>The Cult of Lies:</b> Hell has many\
  \ allies in the mortal world. In once such case, a cult of Asmodeus on the cusp\
  \ of breaching the border between the mortal world and Hell. This elaborate encounter\
  \ features customizations to make it a threat for a wide range of play, making it\
  \ an appropriate climax to either an adventure or an entire campaign.</li> \n  \
  \    <li><b>Exorcism:</b> Fiends sometimes wear the fairest of faces, and their\
  \ disguises aren't always illusions. Can you defeat a zebub devil? What if that\
  \ disgusting devil is firmly rooted inside the body of a 12-year-old?</li> \n  \
  \    <li><b>Everything has its Price:</b> Whether you're striking a deal with a\
  \ contract devil or your trading artifacts in the legendary Market of Breaths, everything\
  \ has a price. Yet Hell rarely accepts currency as mundane as gold. What would you\
  \ trade for power, immortality, or a chapter from the <em>Chronicle of the Righteous</em>?\
  \ Once you've decided you're buying, it's just a matter of finding who's selling.</li>\
  \ \n      <li><b>Living Blasphemies:</b> Not all of Hell's denizens are devils.\
  \ Asuras, immortal beings with grudges against the gods, also strike from Hell's\
  \ depths against pious mortals. The Flowering Jasmine Monastery has fallen to one\
  \ such living-heresy. Can you, and your faith, survive what that holy place has\
  \ become?</li> \n      <li><b>Test of the Hellknights:</b> Before any armiger can\
  \ call herself a Hellknight, she must survive a lethal test: defeat a devil in single\
  \ combat. Learn more about the Hellknights' most infamous rite of passage, with\
  \ details on its strictures, testing grounds, and devils to confront would-be Hellknights\
  \ of all levels.</li> \n      <li><b>The Gate to Dis:</b> The passage between Hell's\
  \ first layer, the wasteland of Avernus, and its second, the metropolis of Dis,\
  \ is one of the most traveled routes in all the planes. The Forked Pyre guards that\
  \ passage, twin spires flanking an endless volcanic cascade. Infernal Duke Furcas\
  \ oversees the orderly passage of the damned through his realm to the torments beyond.\
  \ Learn more about one of Hell's most notorious warlords, his eon-old fortress,\
  \ traits for all infernal dukes, and details on their infernal demesnes.</li> \n\
  \      <li><b>Visions of Hell:</b> Glimpse the face of Hell with one of Pathfinder's\
  \ most METAL covers ever, by Remko Troost. Inside, you'll also see more of Dis,\
  \ depictions of infernal personalities, and maps for every diabolical locale.</li>\n\
