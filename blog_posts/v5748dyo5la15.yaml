  \ Mess with the Wizard-Priest</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, April 1, 2008</p>\
  \ \n   <p>He's back! After taking several months to introduce you to some of the\
  \ <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7x8c\">other</a> <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7zdo\">legendary</a>\
  \ <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7x8b\">authors</a>in our <a href=\"/planetstories\"\
  >Planet Stories</a> line, we've come back around to the source and released <i><a\
  \ href=\"/store/v5748btpy7zdq\">The Samarkand Solution</a></i>, Gary Gygax's successor\
  \ to <i><a href=\"/store/v5748btpy80bn\">The Anubis Murders</a></i>. Though the\
  \ book stands alone (and indeed, all of the Gygax novels we're publishing can be\
  \ read in any order), this adventure once more follows the adventures of Ægyptian\
  \ Magister Setne Inhetep, wizard-priest to Pharaoh himself.</p> \n   <p>Temporarily\
  \ bereft of his bewitching bodyguard, Rachelle, Setne heads down to the city of\
  \ On for some rest and relaxation, only to run across the path of a notorious assassin.\
  \ As the nobles around him begin dropping like flies, Setne is quickly drawn into\
  \ a web of intrigue that finds him working both with and against the local government\
  \ and the evil church of Set. In a city where seemingly everyone is guilty of something,\
  \ a treasonous conspiracy is forming that could shake Ægypt all the way to the halls\
  \ of Pharaoh's palace. But can Setne get to the bottom of things before he himself\
  \ becomes the next victim? </p> \n   <p>For those who enjoyed <i><a href=\"/store/v5748btpy80bn\"\
  >The Anubis Murders</a></i>, I think it's safe to say that you'll enjoy <i><a href=\"\
  \ /store/v5748btpy7zdq\">The Samarkand Solution</a></i> even more. Gygax truly hits\
  \ his stride in this book, and the biggest selling point for me is the introduction\
  \ of Inspector Tuhorus, the hard-bitten city cop assigned to work with Setne. The\
  \ only thing better than one quick-witted protagonist is two of them, and it's fun\
  \ to see someone make the ever-confident Setne a straight man against his will.\
  \ If <i><a href=\"/store/v5748btpy80bn\">The Anubis Murders</a></i> broke some molds\
  \ by presenting an honest-to-goodness mystery in a fantasy setting, <i><a href=\"\
  \ /store/v5748btpy7zdq\">The Samarkand Solution</a></i> pushes the envelope even\
  \ farther by adding an element of the classic \"buddy cop\" film. Toss in Setne's\
  \ desperate attempts to avoid the attentions of the—*ahem*—<i>affectionate</i> and\
  \ beautiful Lady Xonaapi, and the novel ends up somewhat racier than its predecessor\
  \ as well. But really, for me, reading a Gygax novel is all about the magic, and\
  \ Samarkand certainly doesn't disappoint on that count, as can be seen in the following\
  \ excerpt: </p> \n   <blockquote> <i></i>\n    <p><i>A gigantic mass of living flames\
  \ shifted, hot-violet spots fixing themselves upon the magister as if they were\
  \ eyes. In fact they </i>were<i> eyes, and red-orange fires parted and a mouth spoke.\
  \ \"You come to your death, fool! Run away, little man, or I shall sear your flesh\
  \ and boil your blood ere I consume you!\" </i></p><i> <p>\"If you thought you could\
  \ do that, efreet, you'd act, not boast,\" Inhetep shouted back. \"Return now to\
  \ your infernal realm, or it is I who will quench you!\" Although the magister had\
  \ expected to encounter some form of creature from the Spheres of Fire, this near-demoniac\
  \ in its most potent form came as a surprise, but he didn't allow the monster to\
  \ have an inkling of that. Even as he spoke, the ur-kheri-heb made preparations\
  \ to carry out his threat. </p> <p>The towering creature of hellfire form reached\
  \ out to grab its antagonist, then withdrew its fiery arm with a shrieking howl\
  \ as it contacted the freezing water. Its cry hurt Inhetep's ears, and the hemisphere\
  \ trembled, bulging in where the efreet had struck it, then restored itself to smoothness\
  \ again. It was noticeably smaller. \"Son of a newt!\" the fire being roared. \"\
  I'll soon have you out of that bubble and fry you slowly for your presumptuousness!\"\
  \ </p> <p>With that, the flame-limbs struck down upon the shielding water, pounding\
  \ upon it again and again. The monstrous thing howled in pain as it sought to destroy\
  \ Inhetep's protection, but it was enraged and determined. Inside his watery shell,\
  \ Inhetep worked desperately. He had to both maintain his defense and mount an offense\
  \ against the efreet. No mere defense could prevail for long in such conditions\
  \ as these. He worked with precision even as the water which protected him hissed\
  \ and wavered and shrank to little more than a few inches of liquid but a foot above\
  \ his sweating head. There was a sudden eruption of steam, and as vapors of superheated\
  \ stuff rose round Setne, the priest-wizard called out, \"Now, thing of perdition,\
  \ you are doomed!\"</p></i> \n   </blockquote> \n   <p> James Sutter <br> <i>Planet\
