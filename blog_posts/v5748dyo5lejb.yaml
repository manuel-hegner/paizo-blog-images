  \ itemprop=\"description\">One thing the Venture-Officers and I have noticed is\
  \ that there tend to be questions that continually come up on the messageboards\
  \ about pushing animals to do something, animals using trained tricks, and other\
  \ such issues regarding animal companions, familiars, etc. The newly released <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy8w7p\"><i>Animal Archive</i></a> added several new tricks\
  \ that a lot of GMs were hand-waving. I received numerous emails asking for clarification.\
  \ Instead of replying to each email separately, I thought the community could be\
  \ better served with a blog post.</span></p> \n     <p>The Ontario Venture-Captain,\
  \ Adam Mogyordi, has written Mergy's Methods in the past and posted on both paizo.com\
  \ messageboards and the <a href=\"http://www.ontariopathfinders.com/\" target=\"\
  _blank\">Southern Ontario Pathfinder Lodge website</a>. Not only have these been\
  \ popular, but players have advised they have been very helpful articles to explain\
  \ confusing rules and the like. I reached out to Adam and he was thrilled to write\
  \ something to help clear up some common confusions players and GMs might have about\
  \ animal companions. Thanks, Adam! Below is the article he wrote for the Pathfinder\
  \ Society community.</p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p><i>Animal Archive</i> gives\
  \ druids and other pet classes a wide range of new options. To utilize these options,\
  \ a review of the basics is a good place to start. Today I want to go over some\
  \ of the rules that go with handling an animal for GMs and players. There are some\
  \ benchmarks Handle Animal users need to meet, and I also have some tips for handlers\
  \ and their GMs.</p> \n      <p><b>New Tricks:</b> There are 18 new tricks available\
  \ in <i>Animal Archive</i>, and some of these may be taken more than once! But while\
  \ you now have much more freedom in what your pet can know how to do (my personal\
  \ favorite new one is Bombard), there is also a side to this that some players may\
  \ find displeasing. The addition of a Flank trick and an Aid trick means that pets\
  \ do not, by default, know how to perform these, even if they know the Attack trick.\
  \ If you command your companion to attack, it will take the most direct route. If\
  \ you want your companion to always flank, you now need the Flank trick. If your\
  \ companion doesn't know one of these tricks, pushing your companion with a successful\
  \ DC 25 Handle Animal check is also an option.</p> \n      <p><b>Handling Your Companion:</b>\
  \ Some players and GMs hand-wave this, but it's important to note that just because\
  \ your pet knows a trick doesn't mean it can perform the trick on command. Animal\
  \ companions certainly cannot read your character's mind, and that's why we need\
  \ to use the Handle Animal skill. A trick the animal knows is DC 10 and is a move\
  \ action. A trick it does not know is a full-round action at DC 25. There are, however,\
  \ a few ways to make this easier.</p> \n      <p>Druids and other classes with the\
  \ animal companion feature get a +4 circumstance bonus when handling their own companion\
  \ from the Link class feature. This also allows them to handle an animal as a free\
  \ action, or use a move action to push the animal. Keep in mind you may still only\
  \ perform the free action on your turn, so even if your animal wins initiative,\
  \ it's not going to automatically do what you want before can you order it.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>With Link, we can set some benchmark numbers a companion class needs.\
  \ The DC to command an animal to perform a trick it knows is only 10, but this increases\
  \ to 12 if the animal is injured or has taken nonlethal or ability score damage.\
  \ With the +4 bonus from Link, the magic Handle Animal modifier you want to hit\
  \ is +5. If you have a +5 modifier at level 1, you are guaranteed to always command\
  \ your uninjured animal companion (the number for an injured companion is +7). GMs\
  \ may wish to log what the player's Handle Animal skill is at the start of the game\
  \ so that they know when to ask for a roll.</p> \n      <p><b>Smart Kitty:</b> If\
  \ you have increased your animal companion's intelligence score to 3 using various\
  \ means, then great! You can now have your companion learn any feat it can physically\
  \ perform, and it can put ranks into any skill. What this increase does not accomplish,\
  \ however, is any advantage in commanding your companion whatsoever. It's still\
  \ the same DC 10 to handle and DC 25 to push. It may still only learn six tricks\
  \ plus your druid bonus tricks. However, for every point of Intelligence it gains\
  \ above 2, that is three more tricks it can learn. A smart animal will have more\
  \ versatility without needing to rely on pushing.</p> \n      <p><b>Why druids don't\
  \ dump Charisma?:</b> So how do we reliably overcome DCs like 25 at reasonable levels?\
  \ I think Skill Focus (Handle Animal) is certainly an option for some druids who\
  \ see themselves as dedicated animal companion users. There is also the training\
  \ harness item from page 76 of the <i>Advanced Race Guide</i> that will give you\
  \ another +2 bonus on these checks. The most important thing is to not dump Charisma.\
  \ If your druid has a Charisma score of 7, you are likely looking at a 20% chance\
  \ of your animal ignoring you at 1st level. If you want to reliably push your companion,\
  \ you are going to make it much more difficult with a negative Charisma modifier.</p>\

  \ please feel free to reply in the comments below. Adam and I will do our best to\
  \ try to answer those in a timely manner.</p> \n     <p>Mike Brock<br> <i>Pathfinder\
