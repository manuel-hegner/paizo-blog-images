  >Liar's Blade</a><i>, Rodrick is handsome, charming, quick-witted—and totally devoid\
  \ of morals. Fortunately for him, his best friend Hrym—a talking sword with a blade\
  \ of living ice—is just as single-minded when it comes to acquiring gold. The pair\
  \ prefer to win their money by tricking those less deserving of it—which is to say,\
  \ everyone else—while expending as little effort as possible. Yet when a mysterious\
  \ patron offers them a lucrative job far to the north, the dastardly duo may find\
  \ themselves in over their heads (or hilts)....</i></span></p> \n    <h2>Chapter\

  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Why would anyone want to meet at a circle\
  \ of standing stones?\" Rodrick leaned against one of the mossy monoliths and gazed\
  \ up at the darkening sky. \"Who wants to talk business out in the woods? I prefer\
  \ taverns for this sort of thing. Taverns are traditional. It's easy to get a drink\
  \ in them. Also, I live above one. Very convenient.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Our mysterious\
  \ prospective employer obviously doesn't want to be seen in public with you,\" Hrym\
  \ said from behind Rodrick, voice muffled. \"I can't say I blame him.\"</p> \n \
  \   <p>\"Possibly he doesn't want to be seen at all.\" Rodrick rubbed the faint\
  \ scratches on his cheek where one of the tavern wenches had raked him with her\
  \ fingernails yesterday. He'd only made a <i>suggestion</i>—and he'd even offered\
  \ a fair price. How was he to know she was a newlywed who took her vows seriously?\
  \ At least she was married to a milkwater shopkeeper and not one of Tymon's countless\
  \ over-muscled gladiators, or Rodrick might have faced more serious injury. \"Maybe\
  \ he's a fugitive from justice or something. We do have some history of working\
  \ with criminals.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Besides one another, you mean?\" Hrym said. \"\
  And anyway, what justice? We're in the River Kingdoms. In Tymon, no less, where\
  \ most arguments are settled by the parties mutually agreeing to beat each other\
  \ bloody. But suppose it is some rank villain. Would you turn down the job?\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"I might. I'm an honest man now, Hrym—at least on this side of the border.\
  \ And at this point in time. As far as anyone knows. It's easier to make a profit\
  \ off a dishonest man, true. But you have to admit, this is a suspicious way to\
  \ organize things, luring me out here all alone. Present company excepted.\" Rodrick\
  \ was relatively comfortable with his position, standing with his back against a\
  \ great huge block of stone, with sightlines as clear as he could get in the forest.\
  \ At least no one would be able to stab him in the kidneys. But there were still\
  \ too many shadows gathering for his liking. \"Picking the lock and leaving a note\
  \ on my pillow. Telling me to come here at dusk if I'd like to make some money.\
  \ And leaving me that little bag of gold as, what, an incentive? A deposit? A retainer?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Lovely gold,\" Hrym said dreamily. \"Just pile it up and let me\
  \ sleep on it, I'll be happy as happy can be.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Yes, I know. You\
  \ have such simple tastes. I still say we should have just taken the bag of coin\
  \ and scampered off. I'm tired of Tymon. The only reason I stayed around after we\
  \ lost all those bets at the arena was because we were too poor to travel in style.\
  \ But we've got a bit of money now—\"</p> \n    <p>\"Yes, but if we leave, we'll\
  \ miss out on making <i>more</i> gold,\" Hrym said, practical as always. \"It's\
  \ not like we have any other prospects for gainful or illicit employment at the\
  \ moment, and that little purse won't last long. Not with the way <i>you</i> run\
  \ through money. You spent the last of our savings on the second-prettiest wench\
  \ in the tavern, you may recall.\"</p> \n    <p>\"The first prettiest was unavailable,\"\
  \ Rodrick said absently. \"But, look, don't you think anyone stupid enough to give\
  \ me a bag of money <i>in advance</i> is, by definition, too stupid to work for?\
  \ Trusting my reliability doesn't say much for their judgment.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Or they could be stupid enough for us to make a <i>lot</i> of money off them,\"\
  \ Hrym said.</p> \n    <p>Rodrick pondered. \"Fair point. \"</p> \n    <p>A moment\
  \ later, the underbrush rustled, and a figure stepped forward from the shadows.\
  \ Not quite short enough to be a halfling or dwarf, but definitely on the small\
  \ side for a human, draped in a bulky cloak that seemed to hint at some concealed\
  \ deformity—a hump, perhaps, or an off-center surplus head. The cloak was made of\
  \ good fabric, though, dark green and richly embroidered along the edges with peculiar\
  \ spiral patterns in dark blue thread. </p> \n    <p>\"I am Zaqen,\" the figure\
  \ said, voice pitched high enough that Rodrick guessed the speaker was female, though\
  \ it was hard to be sure. \"You are Rodrick, of Andoran?\"</p> \n    <p>\"I'm from\
  \ all over,\" Rodrick said. \"And I'm pleased to meet you.\" He gave her one of\
  \ his more roguish smiles, because it never hurts to be charming.</p> \n    <p>Zaqen\
  \ giggled, and Rodrick's smile slipped a notch. People who giggled for no reason\
  \ worried him. </p> \n    <p>\"Is it true,\" she said, \"that those who hire you\
  \ also hire ...your sword?\"</p> \n    <p>\"A warrior isn't much good without his\
  \ sword.\" In truth, despite the rumors he'd caused to be spread throughout the\
  \ region, Rodrick wasn't much of a fighter. He preferred to stab people from concealment\
  \ if stabbing was called for—but one had to keep up appearances.</p> \n    <p>Zaqen\
  \ sidled closer. \"Yes, but ...you have a <i>special</i> sword?\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Special is a good word for me,\" Hrym said. \"Also ‘amazing' and ‘wonderful' and\
  \ ‘amazingly wonderful'—\"</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Zaqen.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Zaqen_360.jpeg\" border=\"0\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> There must be more to Zaqen than meets the eye.\n    </div> \n\
  \    <p>\"The sword talks!\" Zaqen said. \"How marvelous. I'd assumed that was an\
  \ exaggeration.\" She craned her head, trying to get a glimpse of the magical weapon\
  \ sheathed on Rodrick's back.</p> \n    <p>\"I am no <i>it</i>,\" Hrym said. \"‘\
  He' would be better, or any honorifics you choose.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Apologies, O\
  \ mighty blade,\" Zaqen said, her tone deeply amused.<i></i></p> \n    <p>Rodrick\
  \ sighed. Of course she'd heard about the sword. The only people who wanted Rodrick\
  \ for himself alone in recent years were magistrates, city guards, and the occasional\
  \ irate spouse. </p> \n    <p>\"May I see it—I mean, him?\" Zaqen scuttled a few\
  \ steps closer, almost obscenely eager.</p> \n    <p>\"Yes, let me out of this sheath,\"\
  \ Hrym demanded. \"I can't see anything.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Your senses are <i>magical</i>,\"\
  \ Rodrick said. \"It's not as if you have eyes. I don't understand how a leather\
  \ scabbard can possibly impede your vision.\" But he stepped away from the standing\
  \ stone, reached over his right shoulder, grasped the hilt of the longsword, and\
  \ drew Hrym smoothly from his scabbard, holding him aloft to sparkle in the ...well,\
  \ twilight. Noonday sun would have been more dramatic.</p> \n    <p>Hrym <i>was</i>\
  \ looking especially radiant tonight, though: a blade of living ice nearly four\
  \ feet long, transparently crystalline at the impossibly sharp edges shading to\
  \ milky white inward, and on through to a shimmering blue at the center, with steam\
  \ rising in smoky tendrils from all along his length in the humid air. </p> \n \
  \   <p>\"There,\" Rodrick said. \"Meet Hrym, my partner. If this was all some elaborate\
  \ ruse to lure me out here to steal my sword, you might wish to reconsider. The\
  \ last person who picked up Hrym without permission lost half his arm to frostbite.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Though if you offered me sufficient coin, say enough to fill the\
  \ empty hollow of a medium-sized drained lake—\" Hrym said.</p> \n    <p>\"Hush,\
  \ you,\" Rodrick said.</p> \n    <p>\"No.\" Zaqen was suddenly businesslike. \"\
  I am not here to steal your blade. I am here to invite you to join me, and my patron,\
  \ on a sacred quest.\"</p> \n    <p>\"A quest!\" Hrym said. For a sentient sword\
  \ of living ice with no tongue, mouth, or even vocal cords, his voice was remarkably\
  \ human. Hrym sounded like an old man who'd spent several decades running a shop\
  \ that never offered credit, smoking a clay pipe on a porch and pontificating, and\
  \ teaching his nephews dirty jokes. \"I love quests. A sacred one, no less.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"A quest,\" Rodrick repeated, and sighed. \"Well. It's not as if anyone's\
  \ ever died horribly on one of <i>those</i>. Where is this patron of yours?\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"My master is busy with devotional matters. He is a very holy man.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"A holy man?\" Now Rodrick did frown. \"What variety of holy? The\
  \ kind who disapproves of gambling and drinking, or the kind who likes sacrificing\
  \ innocent virgins on altars of black stone, or ...?\"</p> \n    <p>\"The very wealthy\
  \ kind of holy,\" Zaqen said. \"And he has no interest in your morality, or lack\
  \ thereof. As long as you can protect and aid us on our journey, he will be pleased,\
  \ and you will be <i>generously</i> rewarded.\"</p> \n    <p>\"And as for the other\
  \ thing, you're hardly a virgin,\" Hrym said. \"So let your mind rest easy on that\
  \ point.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Let's have a few details,\" Rodrick said. \"Or even broad\
  \ outlines. Where are we going, why are we going there, who's trying to kill us\
  \ along the way, and what are you offering to pay?\"</p> \n    <p>\"We are going\
  \ to Brevoy.\" Zaqen lifted her face to look at Hrym, still shining in the dusk.\
  \ Her face was entirely human, though not particularly pretty: snub nose, thin lips,\
  \ eyes of two different colors, one blue and one green—and the eyes looking in just\
  \ <i>slightly</i> different directions, lending her gaze a fishlike quality. \"\
  To the very edge of any map <i>you're</i> likely to have seen. We seek a sacred\
  \ artifact of great power, locked away for millennia. No one in particular is trying\
  \ to kill us, but the River Kingdoms are dangerous places, and parts of Brevoy are\
  \ little better. And, of course, where there are great treasures, there are often\
  \ powerful guards, and other interested parties seeking the same prize ...My master\
  \ and I are not without resources, but neither of us is particularly skilled with\
  \ weapons, and simply having a strong man with a long blade in our party will act\
  \ as a deterrent against many common bandits—\"</p> \n    <p>\"He asked about payment,\"\
  \ Hrym said. \"That's the one part I actually care about, so don't forget to address\
  \ it, please.\"</p> \n    <p>Zaqen cocked her head, doubtless wondering—as many\
  \ had before—what a magical sword could possibly want with gold. \"My master is\
  \ traditional. We will pay all expenses, of course. If you help us reach our goal,\
  \ Rodrick, we offer your weight in gold as reward.\" She paused. \"Or an equivalent\
  \ value in gems, treasure, property, or a promissory note drawn on a leading bank\
  \ of Absalom.\"</p> \n    <p>\"His <i>current</i> weight in gold, or his weight\
  \ at the end of the journey?\" Hrym said sharply. </p> \n    <p>Zaqen blinked. \"\
  Excellent question. Astute. Forward-thinking. Let's say ...at the end of the journey?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Hmm,\" Hrym said. \"I don't like it. Long overland journeys tend\
  \ to cause weight loss. But he's hardly stout now, so I think we can do better.\
  \ You'd better start eating richer foods, Rodrick. I want you so fat you can't sit\
  \ on a horse by the time we reach Brevoy.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Those terms are acceptable,\"\
  \ Rodrick said calmly. His <i>weight</i> in treasure? That would be enough to fill\
  \ a nice chest for Hrym to use as a bed, with plenty left over for Rodrick to live\
  \ in the manner to which he devoutly hoped to become accustomed. And then there\
  \ was the artifact she'd mentioned—surely <i>that</i> would be worth a bit of coin\
  \ to the right buyer.</p> \n    <p>\"What's the artifact?\" Hrym asked. Rodrick\
  \ suppressed a wince. Hrym had a bad habit of tipping their hand.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  It is a holy relic,\" Zaqen said. \"Of no intrinsic value, and worthless to anyone\
  \ but my master's particular sect.\"</p> \n    <p>Rodrick nodded. \"I understand.\"\
  \ Maybe what she said was even true. But if this holy man's cult could pay a man's\
  \ weight in gold just for a chaperone, what would they pay in ransom for the relic\
  \ itself?</p> \n    <p>\"When do we leave?\" Hrym said.</p> \n    <p>\"Meet us here\
  \ tomorrow,\" Zaqen said. \"Two hours before twilight.\"</p> \n    <p>Rodrick frowned.\
  \ \"You want to travel by night?\"</p> \n    <p>She shrugged, one shoulder dipping\
  \ lower than the other. \"My master sets the schedule. I gather there is a place\
  \ to camp some two hours from here, where he wishes to spend the night.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"Who pays the coin calls the tune.\" Rodrick bowed. \"I'll see you then.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Zaqen disappeared back into the underbrush, walking with a strange,\
  \ hitching gait, but with surprising speed. </p> \n    <p>\"Well then,\" Rodrick\
  \ said. \"I suppose that's settled. Let's head back to the Bloodied Flail and spend\
  \ our advance money.\"</p> \n    <p>\"You'd better keep enough gold to scatter over\
  \ the bottom of a drawer in our rooms,\" Hrym said. \"I don't intend to sleep on\
  \ bare wood again.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Sleep! As if you sleep.\" Rodrick slipped away\
  \ from the standing stones, working his way along the old footpath in the direction\
  \ of Tymon. The woods right around the city weren't especially dangerous—because\
  \ of the gladiatorial arena, Tymon had the highest concentration of heavily armed\
  \ warriors in the River Kingdoms, and they were all obliged to provide a certain\
  \ amount of civil defense—but there were always bandits with no sense of self-preservation\
  \ and skulking agents from the neighboring country of Razmiran, which coveted the\
  \ wealth of Tymon. The value of caution was a lesson Rodrick had learned long ago.\
  \ Though the exact lesson was more like, \"Be cautious when no one is watching;\
  \ if you want to impress someone, be ostentatiously bold, if the odds favor success.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Rodrick wasn't a coward, but he found that getting in too many fights\
  \ tended to make his muscles hurt, which detracted from his enjoyment of sex, sleep,\
  \ and other sensual pleasures.</p> \n    <p>They made it back to the main road without\
  \ encountering thieves, thugs, spies, or mad wild beasts. Alive and walking with\
  \ coins jingling in his pocket—what a pleasant sensation. Hrym was back in his sheath,\
  \ keeping quiet. People tended to notice talking swords made of living ice. They\
  \ gaped, or plotted to steal said magical sword, or just asked far too many tedious\
  \ questions, so Hrym seldom spoke in public. There was also the element of surprise\
  \ to consider. Discovering that your enemy was armed with <i>another enemy</i> had\
  \ given many an opponent pause over the years. </p> \n    <p>Rodrick stopped by\
  \ the gates to greet Chumley, the night guard he'd befriended on his first day in\
  \ the city. That was one of Rodrick's little rules: if at all possible, get on friendly\
  \ terms with the fellows capable of opening a gate and letting you slip out unnoticed\
  \ in the middle of the night. The guard helped him tie Hrym's hilt to the scabbard\
  \ with a bit of rough twine. In Tymon, ordinary people had to bind up their weapons\
  \ or leave them with the guards while they were inside the walls, while full-fledged\
  \ gladiators could use bare daggers for jewelry if they liked.</p> \n    <p>Rodrick\
  \ strolled through the gate, nodding at the few familiar faces he saw, especially\
  \ the heavily scarred ones. These were not people you wanted to have for enemies.\
  \ </p> \n    <p>Most of the wooden and stone shops along the central thoroughfare\
  \ were still open, though soon only the bars and betting parlors would be doing\
  \ business. Off in the distance, the roughly palatial Champion's Fortress loomed\
  \ above almost all the other buildings, overshadowed only by the Arena of Aroden,\
  \ by far the largest structure in town. Rodrick had gone to a couple of the fights\
  \ there—the ones he'd bet on most heavily—but his seats were so terrible he'd barely\
  \ been able to see anything except the head of his \"sure thing\" rolling off across\
  \ the sand at the match's conclusion. Blood sports weren't really his preferred\
  \ game. Give him a nice bit of back-alley gambling instead, especially if he could\
  \ provide the dice.</p> \n    <p>\"Aroden.\" Rodrick paused to gaze at the arena.\
  \ \"Some god <i>he</i> turned out to be. Greatest scam ever perpetrated, don't you\
  \ think? He claimed he was going to come back from the heavens and deliver us all\
  \ from evil, and when the time came, he was a no-show. How many times have I pulled\
  \ the same trick at an inn? ‘Oh, I'll come back tonight and settle my bill.' Ha!\
  \ Of course, they say Aroden died, which is a fairly good reason to miss an appointment,\
  \ as these things go.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I met Aroden once.\" Hrym voice was low and\
  \ muffled. </p> \n    <p>Rodrick frowned. \"What? <i>The</i> Aroden? Didn't he stroll\
  \ away from our mortal plane ten thousand years ago?\"</p> \n    <p>Hrym was silent\
  \ for a moment. \"Maybe I'm thinking of someone else,\" the sword mumbled. \"You\
  \ humans all start to look the same after a while.\"</p> \n    <p>Rodrick shook\
  \ his head. \"He was Azlanti—the <i>last </i>Azlanti. I doubt he looked much like\
  \ the rest of us—\"</p> \n    <p>\"Bipedal. One head, with hair on it. Two arms.\
  \ Close enough.\"</p> \n    <p>Rodrick snorted. It was often impossible to tell\
  \ if Hrym was boasting, lying, deluded, or genuinely ancient. Even the sword himself\
  \ often seemed unsure of his true history. But what mattered now was their future.\
  \ If they were off on a long, harsh journey tomorrow, they'd better enjoy tonight.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Their current home was a room above the Bloodied Flail, close enough\
  \ to the arena to hear the screams of the crowd if the wind was right. Despite the\
  \ tavern's name, and the sign bearing an image of a multi-headed whip dripping crimson\
  \ paint, the Flail wasn't a particularly violent or rough tavern. That was just\
  \ the aesthetic in Tymon, the city of gladiators: blood, weapons, severed heads\
  \ dangling by their hair, and so forth. For all that the place was founded on blood,\
  \ it was one of the more <i>polite</i> places Rodrick had spent time. Something\
  \ about the fact that every third person you met was a seasoned arena fighter bristling\
  \ with weapons prompted people to mind their manners.</p> \n    <p>Rodrick kicked\
  \ the mud off his boots before pushing through into the Flail's common room—the\
  \ owner had given him the rough side of her tongue the first time he tracked in\
  \ muck, and he believed in staying on good terms with one's landlady, at least until\
  \ it came time to skip out on the final bill. </p> \n    <p>It was only just nightfall,\
  \ so the place wasn't too full yet, and he got a spot next to the bar. The prettiest\
  \ waitress, Sonya—the one he'd propositioned, getting a slap complete with fingernails\
  \ for his trouble—narrowed her eyes at him and disappeared into the back, but Sweet\
  \ Jill approached with a smile and poured him a mug of beer. He took a sip and smacked\
  \ his lips. \"Much obliged. Have I told you how your hair reminds me of the embers\
  \ of—\"</p> \n    <p>\"Save it.\" She kept smiling, but he saw now that her eyes\
  \ were serious. \"Flirt with me tomorrow, if you're still alive.\"</p> \n    <p>Rodrick\
  \ raised one eyebrow in what he knew to be a charming and suggestive way. \"Unless\
  \ you're planning to <i>ride</i> me to death—\"</p> \n    <p>\"It's Sonya,\" she\
  \ said. \"She didn't like the way you talked to her.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I suppose\
  \ I could apologize, though I can't imagine why her feelings should be hurt. I would\
  \ hardly seek the company of a woman who wasn't beautiful and exceptional and amazing,\
  \ present company most definitely included, so really it was a <i>compliment</i>\
  \ when I asked—\"</p> \n    <p>\"You're from out of town.\" Jill sounded sad, which\
  \ was worrisome. \"You didn't know any better. I tried to tell her that, but she's\
  \ still upset. Most of our patrons know better than to try and have it off with\
  \ her.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I didn't know she was married,\" Rodrick said. \"Let alone\
  \ <i>newly </i>married. I would have held my tongue if I'd realized.\" Not entirely\
  \ true, but he would have approached things differently. \"Why are we talking about\
  \ such tedious things when I have a bag of gold and—\"</p> \n    <p>\"You should\
  \ probably leave town.\" She tried to nudge him off his barstool with her hip. </p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"But <i>why</i>? Her husband is a fine man, I have no doubt, but he\
  \ runs a shop, and it's not even something frightening like a weapon shop or a butcher\
  \ shop. It's a general goods store. The man isn't likely going to challenge me to\
  \ a—\"</p> \n    <p>\"No,\" said a voice from behind him, a deep bass rumble full\
  \ of amusement. \"But her brother might.\"</p> \n    <p align=\"center\"><b>Want\
