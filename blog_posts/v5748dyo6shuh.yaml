  \    </div> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">“Typically, when\
  \ a patrol is sent out to escort a diplomat, they can handle themselves!”</p> \n\
  \     <p>Amircia winced, took a moment to reload her pistol, and took aim at the—\
  eyes? hands?—eye-hands of the blood painter closest to her. “<em>Typically</em>,\
  \ our patrols don’t get surrounded by aberrations.” A clean shot straight through\
  \ the appendage, and she was already moving in with her machete to sever the wounded\
  \ limb.</p> \n     <p>Rahaksenwe snorted, adjusting her hold on her spider gun.\
  \ She took a breath in time with the gun’s pulsing and fired, covering another blood\
  \ painter in webbing. Taking advantage of the shrieking creature’s immobilization,\
  \ she moved closer, stomping on its torso, and fired the poison shot right into\
  \ its face. “It’s just interesting to me that you didn’t need an escort into Port\
  \ Valen, but you felt I needed an escort into Jolizpan. On your left!”</p> \n  \
  \   <p>“And clearly I was correct!” Amircia turned in time to catch the blasted\
  \ aberration’s teeth around her blade instead of her shoulder. A muttered prayer\
  \ under her breath as she positioned her pistol alongside the machete, eliminating\
  \ another blood painter with a shot before it could attempt to make art out of her.\
  \ She spun around, aiming at another one of the creatures before it could reach\
  \ Rahaksenwe and swearing when she heard the audible click of her pistol jamming.\
  \ “Another one!”</p> \n     <p>“Got it!” Rahaksenwe took a half-step back, adjusting\
  \ the spider gun once more to fire webbing at the blood painter’s feet, causing\
  \ it to trip and stumble across the tree roots. </p> \n     <p>Amircia took advantage\
  \ of the creature’s clumsiness, finishing it off with her machete before taking\
  \ a moment to catch her breath and look around. “Is this... all of them?”</p> \n\
  \     <p>“Seems like it, though I have been wrong before.” Rahaksenwe leaned against\
  \ a tree and slid into a sitting position. She let out a breath and returned her\
  \ spider gun to its proper place on her back. “You did well, thank you,” she said\
  \ softly, feeling her connection to the creature she’d made the weapon from.</p>\

  >Pathfinder Guns &amp; Gears</a></h3>\n     </div> \n     <br> \n     <p>“Are you\
  \ hurt?” Amircia looked the other woman over, concerned about her well-being and\
  \ wanting to be on the move as quickly as possible.</p> \n     <p>Rahaksenwe shook\
  \ her head, getting to her feet. “No, thank Desna. They caught your patrol by surprise,\
  \ but by the time they’d revealed themselves I was already armed and ready. How\
  \ far until the city?”</p> \n     <p>“A little less than a day. Strange that they\
  \ would attack so close to the city and not come after you when you were alone.”\
  \ Amircia nudged one of the bags of the blood painters and frowned, shaking her\
  \ head. “Strange that they’re here at all, really.”</p> \n     <p>“Perhaps the beauty\
  \ of the skyline drew them here.” Rahaksenwe gestured to a small, clear space in\
  \ the trees. “Through here you can see the city outline against the mountains. It\
  \ took my breath away. Maybe they wanted to make it theirs, too.”</p> \n     <p>Amircia\
  \ followed her to the clearing and smiled a bit, looking at the outline of Jolizpan.\
  \ “Maybe.” She glanced back at the scene they had left behind and grew somber. “\
  We should be on the move. I don’t want to attract any other creatures and I’ll need\
  \ to organize a larger, better trained patrol to come back for our soldiers.”</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Rahaksenwe nodded solemnly, adjusting her pack and gesturing for Amircia\
  \ to lead the way. “Remember, I am not as sure-footed as you. Let an old woman keep\
  \ up.” She chuckled softly at Amircia’s snort and followed her lead.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>“Your gun.” Amircia commented after they’d walked for some time. “It’s a beast\
  \ gun.” She glanced sideways at Rahaksenwe, her statement just as much a question\
  \ as it was a declaration.</p> \n     <p>“Correct. I inherited this one from my\
  \ grandmother.” Rahaksenwe unholstered her spider gun, feeling it grow warm to her\
  \ touch as the magic activated. “She was there to see me off on my hunt to find\
  \ the ogre spider and she was there to welcome me back with herbs and soup when\
  \ I returned with the components needed.” She smiled a bit at the memory before\
  \ holstering the gun once more.</p> \n     <p>“So, she was also one to scope the\
  \ battlefield before firing a single shot?” Amircia asked, adjusting her headdress\
  \ after ducking beneath a swinging branch.</p> \n     <p>Rahaksenwe nodded, wiping\
  \ sweat from her forehead. “She was. She taught me to look and listen before firing\
  \ and to make sure that I kept myself at advantage. Not like my nephew, who spends\
  \ all year with his screech shooter that he built from a snowy owlbear. He rolls\
  \ into town like he’s never seen an angry auntie before!”</p> \n     <p>“Did your\
  \ grandmother oversee his ritual, too?” Amircia asked curiously, using her machete\
  \ to clear the path before them. The sun was starting to dip below the horizon,\
  \ and she didn’t like the odd silence that had fallen over the jungle along with\
  \ the storm clouds overhead. It felt like the creatures in the jungle, usually so\
  \ chatty and busy before a storm, were preparing for something big.</p> \n     <p>“\
  No.” Rahaksenwe sighed, shaking her head. “She’d already left us by the time he\
  \ was old enough to hunt on his own. I oversaw his ritual. I’m proud of him, even\
  \ if he is too cocky for his own good. Makes sense his gun chose him.”</p> \n  \
  \   <p>Amircia chuckled before pausing and tilting her head. She held an arm out,\
  \ stopping Rahaksenwe in her tracks. “Do you hear that?”</p> \n     <p>“The thunder?”\
  </p> \n     <p>Amircia shook her head, earrings clinking softly. “The screaming.\
  \ Sounds like a drake of some kind.”</p> \n     <p>Rahaksenwe took a second to listen\
  \ before frowning and taking out her spider gun. “Do you have more bullets?”</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“I always have more bullets. Do you have more energy?”</p> \n     <p>Rahaksenwe\
  \ cracked a smile, dropping her pack and squaring up alongside Amircia as the sound\
  \ of crashing foliage and thundering footsteps drew close. “I always have more energy\
  \ for a good hunt. Lead the way, old friend.”</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p style=\"\
