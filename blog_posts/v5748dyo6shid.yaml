  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Today we continue a series\
  \ sampling the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq026jv?Starfinder-Alien-Archive-4\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Alien Archive 4</em></a>!</p> \n     <p>If you are new to Starfinder,\
  \ the Alien Archives hold a trove of tools for players and GMs alike. </p> \n  \
  \   <p>For players “AA4” holds a dozen races with full rules, letting you play everything\
  \ from a fungus-uplifted animal to a humanoid made of magical coral. Last week we\
  \ looked at the astriapi. We showcase at the copaxi below.</p> \n     <p>For GMs\
  \ there are nearly 100 uncanny life-forms both classic and new, from the batlike\
  \ grioth and horrifying brain collector to the vengeful endling and dreaded plasmalisk.\
  \ Grafts were established in the Appendix 1: CREATING MONSTERS AND OTHER NPCS in\
  \ the first <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujg?Starfinder-Alien-Archive\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Alien Archive</em></a>. They were further developed or expanded\
  \ upon the subsequent <a href=\"https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/rulebooks\">Alien\
  \ Archive</a> volumes. </p> \n     <p>Now, <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq026jv?Starfinder-Alien-Archive-4\"\
  ><em>Alien Archive 4</em></a> adds species grafts—new rules for grafting the strange\
  \ physical traits of other species onto your own character, creating a staggering\
  \ array of customization options!</p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p>SPECIES GRAFTS</p>\
  \ \n      <p>This section introduces a new type of augmentation known as a species\
  \ graft, giving you the ability to partially transcend your species by taking on\
  \ the racial traits of other species. Species grafts follow the rules for augmentations\
  \ (<a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy9ssr?Starfinder-Core-Rulebook\"><em>Starfinder\
  \ Core Rulebook</em></a> 208), in that they are installed in specific systems on\
  \ your body. Once installed, they become a part of your body and generally can’\
  t be affected by abilities that destroy or disable objects. Most of these augmentations\
  \ are installed into the more common systems.</p> \n      <p>Species grafts can\
  \ be cybernetics, biotech, magitech, nanite enhancements, or any other form of augmentation.\
  \ A specific species graft might describe its form, but that is merely an example.\
  \ Your GM might decide what a species graft looks like when you purchase one or\
  \ you might determine its specifics when you craft it. This doesn’t affect how a\
  \ species graft functions—only its appearance.</p> \n      <p>The benefits of a\
  \ species graft don’t stack with the benefits granted by a racial trait of the same\
  \ name. For example, a vesk character can’t benefit from the armor savant graft.</p>\
  \ \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>Read more about the new rules, how they are different\
  \ from other augmentations, and see the list of over 20 species grafts in your copy\
  \ of Alien Archive 4. Here are a couple of samples to entire you! </p> \n     <blockquote>\
  \ \n      <p>CHEEK POUCHES GRAFT — SYSTEM Throat<br> PRICE 3,900 — LEVEL 6</p> \n\
  \      <p>Ysoki’s cheeks are remarkably stretchy, and they use this to their advantage.\
  \ Durable skin implanted in your own cheeks affords you the same benefit. You can\
  \ store up to 1 cubic foot of items weighing up to 1 bulk in total in your new cheek\
  \ pouches, and you can transfer a single object between hand and cheek as a swift\
  \ action. You can disgorge the entire contents of your pouches onto the ground in\
  \ your square as a move action that doesn’t provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>LASHUNTA MAGIC GRAFT — SYSTEM All Hands<br> PRICE 3,200 — Level 5</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Most lashuntas have the ability to cast minor spells, even if they\
  \ haven’t formally studied spellcasting. With tiny attuned crystals or magically\
  \ aligned plates in your palms, you can cast daze and psychokinetic hand at will\
  \ and detect thoughts once per day as spell-like abilities. The caster level for\
  \ these effects is equal to your level.</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <center>\n\

  \ style=\"font-size: 13px;\"></p>\n     </div> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p>Copaxis\
  \ evolved from copi, an unintelligent, coral-like organism that once covered their\
  \ home world—the now heavily industrialized planet Tabrid Minor. Copi exhibit a\
  \ supernatural attunement to the universe’s gravitational forces, and for ages,\
  \ copaxis harnessed this organism’s power to create floating cities where they lived\
  \ for centuries in a near-utopia.</p> \n      <p>The Signal changed copaxi society\
  \ forever in 3 AG when copaxi inventors discovered how to refine copi into a semi-organic\
  \ alloy suitable for constructing starships. Conflicting ideologies arose between\
  \ traditionalists who clung to their people’s ancient mysticism and technological\
  \ innovators who wished to explore the stars. These differences led to violence\
  \ and, eventually, all-out war. The ensuing struggles toppled the established order,\
  \ nearly destroyed copaxi mystical traditions, and led copaxis to abandon their\
  \ flying cities in pursuit of industrialization. The newly united copaxis decimated\
  \ the planet’s copi, simultaneously fueling a technological revolution while also\
  \ severing their connection to the copi’s supernatural power.</p> \n      <p>Thanks\
  \ to their world-spanning government’s fearful suppression of its past for decades,\
  \ modern copaxis have only recently begun uncovering their planet’s history. Most\
  \ admit that Tabrid Minor has suffered as a result of rapid industrialization, but\
  \ few know the extent of the damage or comprehend their ancestors’ sacrificed connection\
  \ to copi. Fewer still know the history of robotic life on the planet, for the government\
  \ strictly monitors such technology and has instilled a superstitious fear of anything\
  \ resembling a sentient machine in the populace. After Tabrid Minor began petitioning\
  \ the Pact Worlds for protectorate status several years ago, the planet’s government\
  \ increased its crackdown on historical introspection, fearing the world’s fraught\
  \ past might undermine its chances of being accepted.</p> \n     </blockquote> \n\
  \     <p>Read more about the cotopaxi in Alien Archive 4, including these racial\
  \ traits:</p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p><b>Natural Communicator</b>: A copaxi\
  \ quickly adopts new forms of communication. Each time a copaxi gains a rank in\
  \ Culture, they learn two languages rather than one language.</p> \n      <p><b>Regenerative\
  \ Evolution</b>: A copaxi gradually reshapes their body and neural networks to overcome\
  \ new challenges. Each time a copaxi gains a level, they can retrain all the choices\
  \ of one previous character level, as though they had used a mnemonic editor (<a\
  \ href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy9ssr?Starfinder-Core-Rulebook\"><em>Core\
  \ Rulebook</em></a> 226). They must have qualified for any new selections at the\
  \ retrained level.</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>The <em>Alien Archive 4</em>\
