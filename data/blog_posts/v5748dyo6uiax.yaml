  \ There’s less than two weeks remaining in the Battlecry! playtest for the new commander\
  \ and guardian classes, so if you haven’t had a chance to register your feedback,\
  \ report to <a href=\"https://paizo.com/pathfinderplaytest\">https://paizo.com/pathfinderplaytest</a>\
  \ to download the PDF and find the links to the surveys. There’s been a lot of interest\
  \ in the playtest so far—it was downloaded more times than the original Pathfinder\
  \ playtest in the first few days!—but we can use every last one of your forward\
  \ reports. Of course, the boffins back at home base have been paying attention to\
  \ what you’ve had to say so far in the surveys and on the forums and are starting\
  \ to formulate ways to make these classes even better.</p>\n      <p>We’ll have\
  \ a lot more intel from the feedback front once the playtest closes. It’s too early\
  \ to note what exactly we’ll be tweaking and how we’ll be changing it, but here\
  \ are a couple little tidbits of information.</p>\n      <ul>\n       <li>The commander\
  \ will receive more tactics for a diverse set of playstyles, especially master and\
  \ legendary tactics!</li>\n       <li>We saw that there was some confusion about\
  \ the Hardness and statistics for the commander’s banner, so we’re already looking\
  \ to make sure that will be clarified.</li>\n       <li>Similarly, we have noticed\
  \ a few wording issues with the guardian’s threat technique and have flagged that\
  \ class feature for future work.</li>\n       <li>We’re also closely examining the\
  \ numbers of the guardian’s Taunt ability, with the hopes of creating something\
  \ that will really sing.</li>\n      </ul>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n\

  \ de Beek.</p>\n      </div>\n      <br>\n      <p>I’d also like to share a couple\
  \ of anecdotes from my own playtests of the guardian! The first, which occurred\
  \ over PaizoCon weekend, saw a 4th-level party dealing with a “swamp witch,” who\
  \ was just an ogre glutton and a boggard swampseer working together. The guardian\
  \ of that party used Area Cover to turn a successful basic Reflex save into a critical\
  \ success, preventing the group’s fighter from taking any damage! For the second\
  \ playtest, we put together some 16th-level characters to face an ancient adamantine\
  \ dragon! The guardian’s ability to withstand damage was put to the test, but he\
  \ stood firm against the threat and even managed to grapple the fearsome opponent\
  \ for a round. Overall, these playtests have allowed me to see the classes in action\
  \ and better understand how people might play them, which will help the team better\
  \ refine their mechanics.</p>\n      <p>We don’t yet have sketches for our new iconics\
  \ but rest assured that Wayne Reynolds is in the trenches producing his usual stellar\
  \ art. Personally, I’m so excited about what we’ve got in store for these two characters.\
  \ Now, you might be able to guess some facts about one of the iconics, but I’m certain\
  \ you’re going to be surprised by the other one! If you’ve got some theories, I’\
  d love to hear them in the comments!</p>\n      <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight:\
