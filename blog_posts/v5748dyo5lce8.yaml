  \ E. Vardeman</p> \n  <h2>Chapter Four: Last Stands</h2> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>\"\
  We should leave,\" Beeah said, tears in her eyes. \"If what you say is true, we\
  \ can't fight Lord Suvarian.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Who is he?\" piped up young Rayallan.\
  \ The boy looked around curiously. Rorr caught his breath looking into the boy's\
  \ face. He saw Ulane there, never quite sure what was going on but interested all\
  \ the same. And usually wrong when he decided.</p> \n   <p>\"He thinks he's got\
  \ the right to take our property,\" Fren said.</p> \n   <p>Rorr wasn't sure about\
  \ his older stepson. Some of Beeah shone through, but none of her fearfulness. And\
  \ Fren lacked the wide-eyed wonder Rayallan showed. He wished the boy were older.\
  \ He could use a strong arm protecting his back.</p> \n   <p>\"He is a petty lord,\
  \ like—\" He bit off the rest. There was no point describing Suvarian in terms they\
  \ wouldn't understand. \"I've seen men like him. Thievery is always their first\
  \ move.\"</p> \n   <p>\"He's got a lot of armed men,\" Rayallan said. \"Fren said\
  \ there were half-orcs. I've never seen one.\" The longing in the boy's voice also\
  \ reminded Rorr of his brother. Never quite brave enough to explore his world, but\
  \ always certain something lay just beyond the horizon. Ulane had died unfulfilled\
  \ in so many ways.</p> \n   <p>But he'd had a loving wife and two fine sons. Rorr\
  \ let out breath he hadn't realized he held.</p> \n   <p>\"If we run, we will have\
  \ nothing. The harvest will be lost. The house and everything in it will be destroyed.\"\
  </p> \n   <p>\"We can take some things...\" Beeah looked around in despair.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"The Torvans probably thought the same. If they got away, it was with\
  \ little more than what they wore.\"</p> \n   <p>\"That was a lot of grain that\
  \ burned,\" Fren said. A wild light came to his eyes. \"You should have seen it\
  \ blow up. It was like—\"</p> \n   <p>\"Like what will happen to our grain, to our\
  \ house and barn unless we fortify,\" Rorr said. At some point listening to his\
  \ sons and watching his wife agonize over losing hard-won furniture and keepsakes,\
  \ he had decided. They would fight.</p> \n   <p>\"How?\"</p> \n   <p>\"Board the\
  \ windows. Rayallan, you're good with a hammer. See to using that pile of cut planks\
  \ out back.\"</p> \n   <p>\"I'm good with a hammer? You mean it? Yes!\" He rushed\
  \ off, excited at being praised—and needed. Rorr hoped that the boy would live to\
  \ brag about it.</p> \n   <p>\"What can we do?\" Beeah asked. Fren scowled at his\
  \ mother as she wrapped her arms around him in a fiercely protective hug. \"Fren\
  \ and I can help.\"</p> \n   <p>\"They use fire arrows. Water will keep anything\
  \ surrounding the arrow from burning, but the arrow itself cannot be extinguished.\"\
  </p> \n   <p>\"Tongs,\" Fren said suddenly. \"Fire tongs. And heavy gloves. I can\
  \ pluck the arrows out that way!\"</p> \n   <p>Rorr nodded. It wasn't likely to\
  \ work the way his son thought, but it might save some damage.</p> \n   <p>\"What\
  \ are you going to do?\" Beeah wrapped her arms around herself as if she were cold.\
  \ She shook. Rorr moved to comfort her, then realized there was no time. He heard\
  \ the pounding of hooves in the distance.</p> \n   <p>He swung about and went to\
  \ the oak where the hole among its roots still beckoned. Dropping to his knees,\
  \ he pulled the final oilcloth-wrapped package from the ground. He stripped away\
  \ the thick cloth and gripped the sword within. It felt familiar in his hand, bringing\
  \ with it memories of other times. He settled the buckler on his left arm, adjusted\
  \ his greaves, then went out to face the riders before they had a chance to set\
  \ fire to his house.</p> \n   <p>A quick glance over his shoulder showed his younger\
  \ son hammering furiously to fasten the wood over the windows. Rayallan paid attention\
  \ to nothing but his work. Every blow of his hammer drove a nail in. Some took two\
  \ strikes, but Rorr approved. Through the open door he saw his wife and other son\
  \ moving furniture so the doorway could be blocked in a few seconds.</p> \n   <p>He\
  \ had no more time to consider how the defense went. A dozen riders approached,\
  \ slowing and finally coming to a halt.</p> \n   <p>\"You're still here,\" the lead\
  \ rider called. He urged his horse forward a few yards, cutting the distance between\
  \ them in half. He wore light plate armor emblazoned with the sigil the others had\
  \ worn. An articulated glove on his right hand curved around the saddle horn. His\
  \ ungloved left hand dangled free at his side but was only inches away from a large\
  \ shield, also decorated with the gerfalcon rampant.</p> \n   <p>\"It's my land.\"\
  \ Rorr held his sword at his side and partially behind him to hide it from the man.</p>\

  I'm Lord Suvarian.\"</p> \n   <p>Rorr knew the lord expected a reply. He remained\
  \ silent.</p> \n   <p>Suvarian bristled and drew his sword, brandishing it over\
  \ his head.</p> \n   <p>\"You defy me, man of dirt. You are a farmer. I am lord\
  \ of all these lands! Go to your knee! Show me respect.\"</p> \n   <p>\"You're a\
  \ cattle herder who takes on airs,\" Rorr shot back. \"Are you truly royalty? Or\
  \ are you some squire's bastard son out to make a name for himself?\"</p> \n   <p>Suvarian\
  \ roared and galloped forward, sword slashing. Rorr stepped to the left side of\
  \ the lord's horse, forcing the man to awkwardly reach across his body in a futile\
  \ attempt to land a blow. Before he could gauge the proper distance, he was past\
  \ Rorr and fighting to wheel his horse about.</p> \n   <p>Rorr looked at the other\
  \ soldiers. They wore heavier armor than the men he had killed. None carried a bow\
  \ and arrow. That brought a slow smile to his lips. He might have destroyed all\
  \ their bowstrings, or perhaps these were Suvarian's personal guard and fancied\
  \ themselves swordsmen. They sat awkwardly on their horses and seemed uneasy with\
  \ their weapons.</p> \n   <p>\"These are back-stabbers, not fighters,\" Rorr said.\
  \ He pointedly turned his back on the dozen soldiers and faced Suvarian. \"Take\
  \ them and go. I have work to do.\"</p> \n   <p>Rorr widened his stance as Suvarian\
  \ prepared for another attack.</p> \n   <p>\"I have wasted enough time. Leave or\
  \ die!\"</p> \n   <p>\"How many of your men have I killed already? I lost count.\
  \ A battle scribe will be needed for the tally if you refuse to leave now.\"</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"You? You, a farmer?\" Suvarian barked the words, but a hint of uncertainty\
  \ came and he looked over at his guardsmen. He boasted for them—and to bolster his\
  \ own courage. The failed first attack had obviously unsettled him. \"Give this\
  \ whelp a sword. I would fight him.\"</p> \n   <p>\"After I kill you,\" Rorr asked,\
  \ \"your men will depart?\"</p> \n   <p>Suvarian laughed. It carried a hint of madness\
  \ in it.</p> \n   <p>\"You cannot slay an armored knight. I am lord of these lands\
  \ and a master swordsman!\"</p> \n   <p>A rider came up with a sheathed sword. He\
  \ threw it to the ground beside Rorr.</p> \n   <p>\"Then your death will be mourned\
  \ near and far.\" Rorr kicked the sword aside without looking at it. \"I prefer\
  \ to use my own.\" </p> \n   <p>He lifted the sword from where he had held it at\
  \ his side. Sunlight glinted off the intricate hilt, the fine etching on the blade,\
  \ the wicked, slightly curved tip and the edge so sharp that it cut through the\
  \ air without even the softest whisper.</p> \n   <p>The soldier who had dropped\
  \ the sheathed sword moved away a few yards. He called to the others, \"He has an\
  \ Aldori dueling sword!\"</p> \n   <p>This caused momentary furor among the men.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"Where did you find the sword, farmer?\" Suvarian called. \"You can hurt\
  \ yourself with such fine steel.\"</p> \n   <p>\"I never so much as nicked myself\
  \ through three border wars.\" Rorr lifted the sword to display the intricately\
  \ decorated boss at the end of the hilt.</p> \n   <p>\"A swordlord's seal. Where\
  \ did you steal that, plowboy?\" Suvarian sounded less sure of himself.</p> \n \
  \  <p>\"It has been my soul and companion for four years.\"</p> \n   <p>The lord's\
  \ face drained of blood. \"You are a thief and a liar!\"</p> \n   <p>\"I challenge\
  \ you, Suvarian. Fight or leave my land now!\"</p> \n   <p>The soldiers murmured\
  \ when their lord did not instantly move to slay the impudent peasant.</p> \n  \
  \ <p>\"You,\" Lord Suvarian called to them. \"Yorrial, Juston, Jerra—kill him! Fight\
  \ him!\"</p> \n   <p>\"I challenged <i>you</i>, Suvarian.\"</p> \n   <p>\"All of\
  \ you, attack! Kill him!\" Suvarian tried to force his horse to back away, but the\
  \ animal balked.</p> \n   <p>His warriors milled about until one finally let out\
  \ a battle cry and galloped forward. Rorr looked from Suvarian to the attacking\
  \ soldier. He took a quick double step to the side, ducked, threw up his buckler\
  \ to deflect the slash, and straightened his bowed legs. His sword tip found the\
  \ spot at the vulnerable bottom of the rider's armor. Rorr felt first resistance,\
  \ then none, then resistance again as the blade drove through internal organs. As\
  \ the rider toppled, Rorr yanked back his blade. He held it high, letting the dead\
  \ soldier's blood run down the small channels on the Aldori sword so the others\
  \ could see.</p> \n   <p>A second warrior started an attack, then veered away.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Rorr turned his back on the tiny knot of fighters and faced Suvarian.\
  \ The man fought to control his horse. Rorr walked forward, tongue clacking at a\
  \ pace and frequency to unsettle the horse further. It had worked before during\
  \ many battles where he had faced impossible odds. It worked again.</p> \n   <p>The\
  \ horse reared and tossed Suvarian to the ground. The lord landed hard on his back\
  \ and struggled to sit up. His armor wasn't full plate, but the pretender found\
  \ it too heavy to move.</p> \n   <p>Rorr stopped a pace away, eyeing the fallen\
  \ lord. Suvarian screeched like an owl as Rorr slashed. The shriek turned to a blubbering\
  \ sob as Suvarian realized the cuts had done nothing but sever the leather straps\
  \ holding his armor.</p> \n   <p>\"Stand and fight,\" Rorr said coldly. \"If you\
  \ don't, I'll kill you like a rabid dog.\"</p> \n   <p>Suvarian rolled from side\
  \ to side, then shucked off the armor like a snake molting its skin. He struggled\
  \ to hands and knees, then forced himself to stand. He clutched his sword in a clumsy\
  \ double-handed grip.</p> \n   <p>\"I'll cut out your eyes and feed them to crows,\"\
  \ Suvarian said in a shaky voice.</p> \n   <p>Rorr tapped his cheek with the boss\
  \ at the end of his hilt in silent prayer to Gorum. Then he flashed the sword in\
  \ a mocking salute. </p> \n   <p>Suvarian attacked. His assault was primitive, and\
  \ Rorr hoped that his own untrained sons would have done better, had he handed them\
  \ a sword.</p> \n   <p>A quick flurry of parries and a simple thrust sent Suvarian\
  \ staggering away, a long cut across his torso.</p> \n   <p>\"Kill him, you cowards!\
  \ Do as I order!\" Suvarian gripped his weapon fearfully, more like an ax than a\
  \ sword. His eyes widened in fear as Rorr slashed the air. The lord switched from\
  \ threatening to cajoling. \"A thousand acres of pastureland to whoever kills him.\
  \ Two thousand!\"</p> \n   <p>Rorr heard nothing behind him to hint that any of\
  \ Suvarian's soldiers found the offer intriguing enough to die for. He stamped his\
  \ foot and sent Suvarian scuttling away.</p> \n   <p>\"You don't deserve to die\
  \ by my sword—not <i>this</i> sword, with so proud a history.\" Rorr thrust the\
  \ blade into the ground so hard it quivered for several seconds. He saw calculation\
  \ come to Suvarian's eyes. The lord's courage returned as Rorr advanced, weaponless.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"You are a fool, farmer.\" Suvarian screamed and charged.</p> \n   <p>Rorr\
  \ watched, gauged where the pretender's foot would be planted, then swept up his\
  \ shovel where it had been thrust into the ground at the middle of a plowed row.\
  \ He swung the tool with his right hand as he parried Suvarian's thrust off the\
  \ buckler. The tiny shield whined with the impact—and Suvarian fell facedown, tripped\
  \ up by the shovel's shaft.</p> \n   <p>The man tried to rise, but Rorr's patience\
  \ was at an end. He gripped the shovel handle with both hands and swung, batting\
  \ the sword away. A foot in the middle of Suvarian's back forced him flat again\
  \ and pinned him there.</p> \n   <p>A quick look up told Rorr what he needed. None\
  \ of Suvarian's brigands made a move to aid their lord.</p> \n   <p>\"You should\
  \ not prey on those unable to fight back,\" Rorr said.</p> \n   <p>\"I'll see you\
  \ executed!\"</p> \n   <p>\"No, you won't.\" The shovel rose and fell. Suvarian's\
  \ head rolled away and stared off down a plowed row, as if making a final examination\
  \ before approving the straight furrow and deep, even cut.</p> \n   <p>Rorr left\
  \ the shovel buried in the ground, walked deliberately back to where his sword thrust\
  \ up. He withdrew it from the dirt, prepared for a fight against the remaining soldiers.\
  \ </p> \n   <p>Only dust met his eyes. When the cloud settled, his view was unobstructed\
  \ all the way to the trees at the far side of his land, save by the occasional bush\
  \ or sapling. Those would be removed as autumn plowing went on.</p> \n   <p>He turned\
  \ and saw Beeah and his two children. Fren and Rayallan stared openmouthed at Suvarian's\
  \ body. His wife's eyes never left him.</p> \n   <p>\"I'll tend to this,\" he said.\
  \ \"Go back to the house. You did a good job of fastening the planks over the windows,\
  \ Rayallan. Now get your brother to help you remove them.\"</p> \n   <p>\"There's\
  \ no more?\" Fren sounded disappointed.</p> \n   <p>\"Go,\" Rorr said, but there\
  \ was no crack of command in his voice. He was no longer a commander of men. A father\
  \ directing his sons was more appropriate now.</p> \n   <p>\"Aw, Pa,\" protested\
  \ Fren. Then he punched his brother in the shoulder and challenged him to race back\
  \ to the house. Only when they were halfway back did Beeah step up.</p> \n   <p>\"\
  I don't understand,\" she said. \"How—?\" She looked at Suvarian, then jerked away\
  \ from the gory sight.</p> \n   <p>\"No one threatens my family or my land.\"</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Fear widened her eyes—fear of her husband.</p> \n   <p>\"We have work\
  \ to do.\"</p> \n   <p>She opened her mouth to speak, then clamped it shut once\
  \ more as she shook her head.</p> \n   <p>\"I'll plow. When the boys are done with\
  \ the house, send them back. There will be work for them in the fields.\"</p> \n\
  \   <p>\"He was a lord,\" she said, her voice cracked with emotion. \"He will have\
  \ an heir.\"</p> \n   <p>\"He was nothing but a brigand.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Someone\
  \ else will come. If not his heir, then another in his company. What will we do\
  \ then?\"</p> \n   <p>Rorr looked at his wife and held up the shovel. She recoiled.\
  \ He drove the blade into the ground, then heaved the dirt high into the air. Wind\
  \ caught the soil and scattered it. Beeah backed off, then almost ran to the farmhouse.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Rorr took a deep breath, threw the shovel aside, and went to harness the\
  \ plow horse. It took close to a half-hour to return to the field with the horse\
  \ dutifully pulling the plow. Rorr spit on his hands and bent forward to guide the\
  \ plow. There was real work to be done.</p> \n   <p>He didn't even look up when\
  \ the cougar howled in the distance.</p> \n   <br> \n   <p><b>Coming Next Week</b>:\
