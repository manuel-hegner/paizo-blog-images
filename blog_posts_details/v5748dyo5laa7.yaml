  artist: "the likes of authors such as Leigh Brackett, Henry Kuttner, and Gary Gygax\
    \ has been a labor of love for Publisher Erik Mona, Senior Editor Pierce Watters,\
    \ and Editors James L. Sutter and Christopher Paul Carey. It's with great pride,\
    \ then, that we announce that Gary Gygax's Infernal Sorceress has been nominated\
    \ for an Origins Award! Take a look at the back cover copy: \"The underworld of\
    \ the Iberian Peninsula is a dangerous place, filled with cutthroats and swindlers,\
    \ and no pair is more infamous than the gaunt man known as Ferret and the broad-shouldered\
    \ mercenary Raker. Yet when the swashbuckling comrades are framed for the one\
    \ crime they didn't commit, the scoundrels are faced with a choice: bring the\
    \ true culprits to justice, or dance a gallows jig. In order to do so, they'll\
    \ need to pull out all their tricks, stretching magic and muscle to their limit\
    \ as they invade castles, battle subterranean monsters, and bluff their way through\
    \ courts of nobles and shape-shifters in their search for revenge. Yet can even\
    \ this canny, ruthless duo prevail against the beautiful witch that plots their\
    \ downfall?\" Gary's writing style was certainly unique, and for those interested\
    \ in his influence on the modern English lexicon, this article by Stephen Chrisomalis\
    \ is worth checking out. Among other things, the article discusses how he popularized\
    \ the little-used words eldritch and psionic, and effectively created the word\
    \ dweomer whole cloth. Well worth the read! David Eitelbach Editorial Intern"
