  \ itemprop=\"description\"> Last week, I <a href=\"http://paizo.com/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ldsh?Reaper-Miniatures-Bones-An-Evolution-Of-Gaming\"\
  >posted a blog from the floor of Gen Con</a> letting you know about Reaper's <a\
  \ href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1513061270/reaper-miniatures-bones-an-evolution-of-gaming-min\"\
  \ target=\"nofollow\">Bones Kickstarter</a> for their unpainted plastic miniatures.\
  \ At the time, they were just passing $565,000, heading towards the first Pathfinder\
  \ miniatures stretch goal, adding nine Pathfinder goblin minis to their package,\
  \ plus the option to buy the Red Dragon from the cover of the Pathfinder RPG Core\
  \ Rulebook.</span></p> \n    <p>Well, your support blew the roof off their Kickstarter;\
  \ as i write this, it has just passed $1,500,000. And Reaper's next goal, at $1,540,000,\
  \ will bring four more iconic Pathfinder characters. Four <i>more</i>? Yep—since\
  \ my last email, Reaper announced a second Pathfinder stretch goal that was quickly\
  \ achieved, adding seven of our iconic characters: Seelah (paladin), Damiel (alchemist),\
  \ Merisiel (rogue), Feiya (witch), Valeros (fighter), Amiri (barbarian), and Seoni\
  \ (sorcerer). They also added the option to buy the awesome Jabberwock from the\
  \ cover of the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 for only $10. And their latest goal adds\
  \ Bones minis for Kyra (cleric), Ezren (wizard), Lem (bard), and Seltyiel (magus).</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The best deal in miniatures gaming history keeps getting better and better.\
  \ Right now, a $100 pledge (the \"Vampire\" level) will get you 200 Bones minis\
  \ and a metal Sophie the succubus. That means the Bones figures cost only 50 cents\
  \ each! Wow! And if you don't want the metal Sophie, it has been announced that\
  \ you'll be able to opt out of it for $25 credit to put towards other minis, such\
  \ as the gargantuan Nethyrmaul the Undying undead dragon, designed for Reaper by\
  \ Wayne Reynolds!</p> \n    <p>There are only three days left to back this Kickstarter,\
  \ so don't hesitate. This will be the last time that I send you a friendly reminder,\
  \ one gamer to another. I want to see Reaper succeed with this Kickstarter because\
  \ bringing cheaper miniatures to the hobby benefits the whole industry. But I particularly\
  \ wanted to let you, my gamer friends, know so you can get in on the minis deal\
  \ of a lifetime.</p> \n    <p>And as more of us get involved, the deal gets better\
  \ for everyone. If this Kickstarter behaves like most, we could blow through quite\
  \ a few more stretch goals before all is said and done, meaning we'll get even more\
  \ miniatures for our pledges. All you have to do is get involved. I've been told\
  \ that they have more Pathfinder stretch goals waiting in the wings!</p> \n    <p>Many\
  \ of the staff members here at Paizo have already backed this Kickstarter, and I'm\
  \ expecting we'll have quite a few painting parties around the office once they\
  \ arrive. Join in the fun and get involved with the Reaper Miniatures Bones Kickstarter.\
  \ People will be talking about this one for years to come. Are you on board?</p>\
