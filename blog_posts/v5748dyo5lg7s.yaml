  description\">Darvin wasn't sure whether the bluff worked or not, but the result\
  \ was the same. The sewer rats were chasing Darvin and Fife and the two storytellers\
  \ were chasing the assassin, trying to make him believe the pack was under their\
  \ control.</span></p> \n    <p>In the face of the swarm, the half-orc panicked and\
  \ clambered up the blockage of branches, tree limbs, uprooted clumps of soil, and\
  \ stones. When he reached the top of the embankment, he began kicking at the debris\
  \ in desperation. </p> \n    <p>He's trying to dislodge the rubble and flood the\
  \ tunnel, Darvin realized, but that could collapse the whole dam, washing them all\
  \ away.</p> \n    <p>\"Grab him!\" Darvin shouted, snaring one leg while nimble\
  \ Fife leaped up to grab the other. The half-orc screamed in his mad scramble to\
  \ dislodge rubbish. More water poured through the opening.</p> \n    <p>The rats\
  \ were less than ten feet away now, the king among them screeching furiously and\
  \ driving the rats forward.</p> \n    <p>Fife planted his feet against the slopes\
  \ and yelled, \"Pull him down or the rats will never eat his eyes!\" </p> \n   \
  \ <p>Darvin gave him a look and shook his head, but the half-orc screamed and dislodged\
  \ more debris in his panic. </p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\">\n     <a href=\"\

  \ </div> \n    <p>A rumbling followed that shook the tunnels themselves, and a big\
  \ beam of timber shifted, firing a jet of compacted mud and slop that shot down\
  \ the passageway.</p> \n    <p>Darvin and Fife stumbled back, and only then did\
  \ Darvin remember the rats. The rats had come to a stop, water roaring through the\
  \ small gaps of the dam, wood creaking under tremendous pressure, the half-orc crying\
  \ triumphantly.</p> \n    <p>Then it all came down, the pressure of the dam firing\
  \ smaller debris like arrow shot. A chair leg shot past Darvin's head, and he yanked\
  \ Fife away just as the top of the dam disintegrated and cut a trough down its center.\
  \ A V-shaped cascade of water shot through, and Darvin was running down the slope,\
  \ grabbing a handful of Fife's damp cloak.</p> \n    <p>Debris-strewn water punched\
  \ straight down the spine of the tunnel, cutting a line through the swarm. The rats\
  \ were scattered, and even their king turned its eaten tail to the flood and ran\
  \ along the side, pulling its retinue with it.</p> \n    <p>Darvin and Fife stuck\
  \ to the walls of the tunnel, but the breach widened and Darvin watched in horror\
  \ as the flood fanned out toward them. </p> \n    <p></p>\n    <p align=\"center\"\
  >∗ ∗ ∗</p>\n    <p></p> \n    <p>Fife pulled behind his half-brother, the flood\
  \ splashing around his ankles and almost shoving him into Darvin. Debris tumbled\
  \ past them, along with the half-orc who screamed as he sailed past.</p> \n    <p>A\
  \ moment later, the assassin disappeared over the arc of the tunnel's slope and\
  \ Fife and Darvin followed on their butts.</p> \n    <p>\"Wheee!\" Fife cried, throwing\
  \ his hands up.</p> \n    <p>Around them, dozens of rats scrambled for purchase\
  \ and vanished back under the churning tumult. Some climbed atop Fife and Darvin\
  \ and dug in with teeth and claws, but the pair tore them off.</p> \n    <p>From\
  \ behind them came a roar that shook the tunnel, and Fife realized that the rest\
  \ of the dam must have given way. In his mind, he saw the wall of pent-up water\
  \ and timber from the mills that had fallen into the storm channels. Anyone caught\
  \ inside that avalanche would be crushed utterly. </p> \n    <p>\"Darvin!\" Fife\
  \ shouted, but his brother had already understood the danger. They grabbed at walls,\
  \ at grooves and rough stone. Darvin tried to hook the edge of a side-feeder, but\
  \ only slowed himself enough for Fife to slam into him and send them both spinning\
  \ around.</p> \n    <p>Rats bit at them, and pebbles and stones sent flying stung\
  \ them as the avalanche bore down. Fife spun in front of Darvin as his half-brother\
  \ grabbed at the edge of another side-tunnel and lost his grip. A log toppled end\
  \ over end past them and down the slope. They were on the verge of getting swept\
  \ away.</p> \n    <p>A dark spot loomed on the wall and Fife threw his weight behind\
  \ his bag. The momentum hooked him on the side-feeder's edge, his legs kicking against\
  \ the flood that tried to yank him back out. A great weight struck him. Fife almost\
  \ lost his grip, the pressure of Darvin's weight crushing. A moment later, the weight\
  \ was gone. Fife almost cried out in panic, but Darvin was pulling him into the\
  \ collector.</p> \n    <p>Pieces of the broken plug rumbled past them, timbers and\
  \ rocks slamming into the wall with crushing force. The ceiling groaned, the walls\
  \ shook, as the sewer collapsed under the sudden punishment.</p> \n    <p>Fife was\
  \ horrified as masonry crashed down around them, water pushing into the side passages\
  \ like geysers. Fife didn't feel Darvin pulling him until he himself scrambled to\
  \ his feet and began running. </p> \n    <p>\"Are we heroes yet?\" Darvin yelled\
  \ over the tumult. </p> \n    <p>\"Shut up!\" Fife said. The rising water raced\
  \ past his shins, panicking rats clambering up them both. Fife spun and scraped\
  \ the walls to dislodge them. Sometimes Darvin struck rats from him, and sometimes\
  \ he from Darvin.</p> \n    <p>There was no way around it, however: the waters pushed\
  \ them along and they had no recourse but to follow the flow down the spiral of\
  \ the sewers. Rumbles followed elsewhere as parts of the flooded and strained tunnels\
  \ collapsed. Then a thundering that sounded all too close was followed by a horrific\
  \ crash. </p> \n    <p>The brick wall behind them exploded as a battering ram of\
  \ a tree smashed through, followed by a surge of water that swept over them. Fife\
  \ was off his feet instantly and, in the tumult, he could see Darvin fighting to\
  \ swim. Fife extended his backpack to Darvin, sputtering and screaming for him to\
  \ grab hold...</p> \n    <p></p> \n    <p></p>\n    <p align=\"center\">∗ ∗ ∗</p>\n\
  \    <p></p> \n    <p></p> \n    <p>Darvin blinked, blinked again. He was... somewhere.\
  \ A domed stone ceiling stretched overhead, held in place by the ribs of arches.\
  \ His head thundered, his sides hurt, his right arm numb.</p> \n    <p>\"Fife?\"\
  \ He raised his head, looking around. His numb arm was wrapped around the strap\
  \ of Fife's sodden bag, but no Fife. Despite the pounding in his head, he sat up.\
  \ His head swam before the room steadied. Fife squatted next to a pile of rags,\
  \ a makeshift torch in his hand.</p> \n    <p><i>Not rags... a body</i>. \"The assassin?\"\
  \ he asked.</p> \n    <p>Fife shook his head and continued thumbing through the\
  \ tome next to the body. \"The wizard from the first group our employers sent,\"\
  \ he said. \"It's a spellbook, I think.\"</p> \n    <p>Darvin groaned, his back\
  \ popping and snapping as he stood and stretched. \"Is that safe? Wizards are tricky.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Fife shrugged. \"I don't think he was all that good. Most of the baubles\
  \ were colored glass, and not all that impressive.\"</p> \n    <p>\"You searched\
  \ his body?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Yes.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I'm so proud of you!\" </p> \n\
  \    <p>The persistent thundering Darvin heard was the runoff from the feeder tunnels\
  \ emptying into the circular chamber. A wooden grate braced with iron brackets covered\
  \ the floor and sieved the water pouring in to somewhere below, but splintered logs,\
  \ large rocks, shattered crates, and more covered the floor, all too large to fall\
  \ through the grate. </p> \n    <p>Three bodies in total, torn and cut and savaged,\
  \ lay in indignant repose. Darvin dropped Fife's bag next to him and searched through\
  \ the bodies, plucking at coin pouches. </p> \n    <p>\"How'd we get all the way\
  \ there?\" he asked, nodding to where he'd awoken. The nearest tunnel was a good\
  \ dozen feet away, the castoff a steady gush of noise.</p> \n    <p>\"I dragged\
  \ you to the side.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Pff, you're not strong enough.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Okay, I kicked and rolled you like a barrel,\" Fife said, engrossed in the book.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"That I believe. Can you read that?\"</p> \n    <p>Fife smiled. \"No,\
  \ but I get the gist of it. Now this symbol is either warmth or fiery death.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"I'm sure the wizard carried around a spell of snuggly warmth.\" Darvin\
  \ found a beautiful stiletto blade weighted expertly. He slipped it into his belt.\
  \ </p> \n    <p>He reached for another body when he saw the pair of large gleaming\
  \ red eyes glaring at him.</p> \n    <p>\"Uh,\" was all he managed before the eyes,\
  \ teeth, and claws were on him.</p> \n    <p></p> \n    <p></p>\n    <p align=\"\
  center\">∗ ∗ ∗</p>\n    <p></p> \n    <p></p> \n    <p>A shout shook Fife from his\
  \ studies, the rubble around them a sudden fury of rustling and squeaks. Darvin\
  \ thrashed, something large and brown and glinting with teeth clawing at him.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>More rats darted forward, leaping nimbly toward them, and Fife swung\
  \ his torch, striking the closest. The angry embers of red eyes surrounded him.\
  \ He raced to his brother who wielded a stiletto blade Fife had never seen before.\
  \ The king rat leaped away as the halfling jabbed the torch at it, but Darvin managed\
  \ a slash across its hind flanks. </p> \n    <p>The large rat hissed and darted\
  \ off, sending the other rats into a panic. </p> \n    <p>\"Get it!\" Fife said.\
  \ \"Before they rally!\"</p> \n    <p>Fife and Darvin scrambled over logs and clumps\
  \ of moss. The large rat darted from hole to niche, but Fife jammed his torch into\
  \ the shallow warrens, driving it back out. Darvin slashed at it and any rat too\
  \ brave for its own good, helping Fife outflank the bigger rodent and kicking down\
  \ precarious hovels to scatter the packs.</p> \n    <p>The king rat ran for the\
  \ nearest tunnel a dozen feet away along the curved wall. It vanished under a plank\
  \ and Fife jammed his torch beneath; something sharp and unforgiving stung his hand.\
  \ He yelped, dropping the torch as he fell back. The large rat was atop the plank\
  \ in a blur of fur, leaping for the halfling. </p> \n    <p>\"Fife!\" </p> \n  \
  \  <p>The stiletto flashed by, overshooting the king. Suddenly, it sheared down\
  \ sharply, impaling the rodent through the back and into the wood. </p> \n    <p>The\
  \ rats stopped suddenly, Darvin and Fife themselves stunned silent. The king rat\
  \ thrashed against the blade momentarily, and then stilled. With that, the rats\
  \ vanished into the nearest holes, the spell broken.</p> \n    <p> \"Did you see\
  \ that?\" Darvin shouted, exultant. \"The way I made it curve down?\"</p> \n   \
  \ <p>\"I think the dagger's magical.\"</p> \n    <p>\"It's that wrist thing that\
  \ I do.\"</p> \n    <p>\"The one that makes you miss everything? Birds, bottles,\
  \ the sides of barns? The dagger's magical.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I was incredible,\"\
  \ he was flicking his wrist appreciatively.</p> \n    <p>\"Magic will do that,\"\
  \ Fife said, touching the pommel. He pulled it from the rat and handed it back to\
  \ Darvin.</p> \n    <p> Darvin sheathed the dagger as Fife collected his backpack\
  \ and the book of spells. He had much studying to do.</p> \n    <p>\"Come on,\"\
  \ Darvin said. \"We have a knife gate to open.\"</p> \n    <p>Fife smiled. \"Really?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Yeah. Heroes don't leave such things unfinished, right?\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"Right,\" Fife said, beaming ear to ear.</p> \n    <p></p> \n    <p></p>\n\
  \    <p align=\"center\">∗ ∗ ∗</p>\n    <p></p> \n    <p></p> \n    <p>The rains\
  \ stopped two nights ago, leaving the stars free to shine brightly over Oregent.\
  \ The streets remained muddy but traversable, the bells sounding out loud and clear\
  \ as lumber workers returned home from a day of repairs. </p> \n    <p>Along the\
  \ portway, crews had erected a lattice of wooden beams to repair the street that\
  \ had collapsed into the sewers. As Darvin and Fife moved past the construction,\
  \ the Halfling tore down a wall poster: a drawing of them as the heroes who had\
  \ opened the knife gates and saved Oregent from flooding. He folded the poster,\
  \ and pocketed it with a grin.</p> \n    <p>\"Are you sure you don't want to stay\
  \ and enjoy the celebrations?\" Darvin asked, looking back. He'd never had a party\
  \ thrown in his honor, but there was only so much mead he could drink. </p> \n \
  \   <p>\"I'm sure,\" Fife said with a smile. \"Besides, who was it who taught me\
  \ to leave when the going was still good?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Did I? That sounds entirely\
  \ too responsible to be me.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Well, you didn't exactly say it as\
  \ you did live it by outstaying your welcome.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Which time?\" Darvin\
  \ said, defensively.</p> \n    <p>\"Every time,\" Fife pointed to the river lands\
  \ beyond. \"Shall we?\"</p> \n    <p>Darvin smiled. \"More misadventures await.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"To more misadventures,\" Fife agreed, shouldering his pack and stepping\
  \ in line with his brother.</p> \n    <p>\"You still made me taste poo water,\"\
  \ Darvin said.</p> \n    <p>Fife merely smiled.</p> \n    <p align=\"center\"><b>Coming\
