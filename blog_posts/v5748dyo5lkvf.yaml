  \ \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">When talking about the planes, you can't skip\
  \ talking about the planes' most powerful entities. So we're going to chat about\
  \ the gods for a little bit.</p> \n    <p>In <a href=\"/products/btpya1am?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Planar-Adventures\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Roleplaying Planar Adventures</i></a>, all 20 of the core deities\
  \ are presented in the book, each with a deity stat block. These stat blocks aren't\
  \ actual stats for the gods, and they have some of the information you're familiar\
  \ with from places like <a href=\"/products/btpy94wj?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Inner-Sea-Gods-Hardcover\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Inner Sea Gods</i></a>. However, the presentation\
  \ here includes some new things as well. The stat blocks cover things like domains,\
  \ favored weapons, and sacred animals and colors, but it also helpfully collects\
  \ information like allies, enemies, holy days, worshipers, minions, and the gods'\
  \ heralds. The stat blocks also list each of the deities' divine realms and points\
  \ you to which page in the book features more details on that realm. What's new\
  \ and exciting about these is that it also includes something new—divine gifts.</p>\

  \   <p>Divine gifts are boons that gods bestow on devout followers who achieve a\
  \ legendary task or perform a particularly pious act. These divine gifts are unique\
  \ to each god or goddess and allow the GM to spice up the rewards in their game.\
  \ They work as excellent rewards when treasure just doesn't cut it. Divine gifts\
  \ should only be used rarely or else they run the risk of feeling underwhelming\
  \ or watering down the experience. If used against players (or used to favor a specific\
  \ character) using divine intervention has the potential to upset and alienate your\
  \ players. Divine gifts should be used to forward the story and reward significant\
  \ events in the narrative of the campaign. As such, they should only be handed out\
  \ once per player per campaign—but, hey... as the GM you're the god of the world\
  \ you present, so you can what you want.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\">\n  \

  \ \n    <p>Here are a few examples of some divine gifts.</p> \n    <h3>Pharasma's\
  \ Divine Gift</h3> \n    <p>The recipient is not affected by the next effect, damage,\
  \ or other event that would otherwise kill him.</p> \n    <h3>Sarenrae's Divine\
  \ Gift</h3> \n    <p>As the sun rises over the recipient's home world, he can perform\
  \ a 10-minute prayer (this may be part of his daily ritual to prepare spells) to\
  \ invoke the Dawnflower. For the next 24 hours, all healing effects the character\
  \ generates heal the maximum amount of damage possible. In addition, during this\
  \ time he can cast <i>breath of life</i> and <i>heal</i> as spell-like abilities\
  \ 3 times each (CL 20th).</p> \n    <h3>Torag's Divine Gift</h3> \n    <p>The recipient\
  \ can perform a 10-minute prayer (this can be part of her daily ritual to prepare\
  \ spells) to gain divine insight into defense and strategic situations for the next\
  \ 24 hours. During this time, the character gains a pool of 20 defense points. She\
  \ can allocate these points among any number of recipients as untyped bonuses to\
  \ AC or on saving throws, to a maximum of 5 points per target (a single target can\
  \ receive this bonus only to AC or to saving throws, not both). She can reallocate\
  \ these points as a standard action any point during these 24 hours, but each time\
  \ she does so, the total pool of defense points available for the next allocation\
  \ is reduced by 5.</p> \n    <p>That's it for now with all this deity discussion,\
  \ but a little later I'll be back to talk about some of the other sections of <a\
