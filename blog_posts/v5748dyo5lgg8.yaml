  \ Resource Roundup</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, September 2, 2014</p> \n\
  \   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">Many\
  \ of you have already got your hands on <a href=\"/products/btpy97ax\">Pathfinder\
  \ Adventure Path #85: \"The Fires of Creation,\"</a> the first volume of the <a\
  \ href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/ironGods\">Iron Gods Adventure Path</a>. Dedicated\
  \ readers, eager fans, and other messageboard fanatics (<i>you know who you are</i>)\
  \ have been clamoring for us to do something more with Numeria since the nation\
  \ first appeared in the Campaign Setting, but adding in laser guns and robots isn't\
  \ something you do without a considerable amount of preparation. So, to support\
  \ the Iron Gods Adventure Path we went all out with a number of releases intended\
  \ to fully flesh out the campaign and provide fun and interesting options for players\
  \ and GMs alike.</span></p> \n    <p>While you wait for the next volume—<a href=\"\
  /products/btpy97az\">Pathfinder Adventure Path #86: \"Lords of Rust\"</a>—check\
  \ out the wealth of resources we've provided to help you enjoy the Iron Gods Adventure\
  \ Path.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderAdventurePath/PZO9086-TechnicLeague.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderAdventurePath/PZO9086-TechnicLeague_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br>Illustration by Lucio Parrillo\n    </div> \n    <p>The first thing\
  \ we needed were rules for all the technological wonders found in Numeria, so we\
  \ came up with <a href=\"/products/btpy98i0\"><i>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Technology\
  \ Guide</i></a>. This 64-page book not only presents dozens of examples of high-tech\
  \ equipment, but it also provides new feats, spells, archetypes, and even a prestige\
  \ class suited to mastering Numeria's technological wonders. We didn't want to make\
  \ it so that people <i>had</i> to buy this book to run the Iron Gods Adventure Path,\
  \ so we made sure to include all the rules from the <i>Technology Guide</i> in the\
  \ <a href=\"/prd\">Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Resource Document</a> (aka PRD).\
  \ Our own resident robot recently remodeled the PRD to not only include this resource,\
  \ but to also spiff up the place a bit. And it looks great! Have you seen it? Why\
  \ not? Go, now. Go check it out.</p> \n    <p>Now that the rules were covered, we\
  \ knew we'd need a good gazetteer of Numeria to allow GMs to really flesh out that\
  \ part of Golarion. Knowing that there wouldn't be enough space in the back matter\
  \ of the Adventure Path to provide all this information, we got to work on <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy978l\"><i>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Numeria, Land of Fallen Stars</i></a>.\
  \ This 64-page book talks about the nation's history, goes into detail about its\
  \ settlements and people, provides hazards to watch out for while exploring the\
  \ land, and outlines some of the most compelling adventuring sites and hooks to\
  \ keep a group playing in Numeria for years.</p> \n    <p>We couldn't let the GMs\
  \ have all the fun, so we knew we needed some exciting options for characters too.\
  \ Instead of just doing one Player Companion to support the Iron Gods Adventure\
  \ Path, we spread it out over two books. <a href=\"/products/btpy978r\"><i>Pathfinder\
  \ Player Companion: People of the River</i></a> talks about the multitudes of people\
  \ that live along the Sellen River, the largest river system in Avistan that reaches\
  \ all the way up through Numeria. This Player Companion also include the campaign\
  \ traits for players eager to jump into an Iron Gods campaign.</p> \n    <p>Also\
  \ providing support for players hoping to play a stranger race in an Iron Gods campaign,\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy98i4\"><i>Pathfinder Player Companion: People of the Stars</i></a>\
  \ provides character options for some of the most popular aliens in the Campaign\
  \ Setting, new ways to incorporate astronomy into your games, and dozens of new\
  \ traits, feats, gear, and other new mechanics all steeped in some Distant Worlds\
  \ flavoring.</p> \n    <p>Finally, as with every Adventure Path, we also put out\
  \ the free to download <a href=\"/products/btpy98lf\"><i>Iron Gods Player's Guide</i></a>\
  \ that provides advice and suggestions about making characters that fit the themes\
  \ of the Iron Gods Adventure Path and excel at the challenges presented in the campaign.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Players and GMs running an Iron Gods campaign would also do well to check\
  \ the messageboards to see all the fan-made goodies and shared advice from dozens\
  \ of on-going campaigns. I hope everyone has as much fun playing in this Adventure\
  \ Path as we've had working on all this material. Charge your batteries and strap\
  \ on your gear. Let's go to Numeria!</p> \n    <p>Adam Daigle<br> <i>Developer</i></p>\
