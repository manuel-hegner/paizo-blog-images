  \ is a rare occasion when a person can combine two fun events into one. On this\
  \ Monday after the Super Bowl, I get to do just that!</p> \n    <p>First, I want\
  \ to welcome two new Venture-Captains to the ranks in areas that have been in serious\
  \ need of strong organization for some time. The first is St. Louis, Missouri. Originally,\
  \ St. Louis wasn’t on my list. However, that quickly changed when Brett Sweeney\
  \ emailed his interest in becoming a Venture-Captain. He provided a very good resume\
  \ and some outstanding answers to my interview questionnaire. There already seems\
  \ to be a very strong base of players in the region and I am excited to see how\
  \ Pathfinder Society grows in St. Louis, as well as the rest of Missouri, now that\
  \ we have the entire state covered with an awesome group of Venture-Officers.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>I also get very excited when we are able to assign a Venture-Captain\
  \ to a region, or in this case a state, that has had little to no Venture-Officer\
  \ presence, but has been longing for someone to step up to the task of organizing\
  \ Pathfinder Society. I’ve known Martin Shelby for more than 10 years, have played\
  \ roleplaying, board, card and miniatures games with him during that period, and\
  \ know his organizational and gaming skills are up to the task. When he moved from\
  \ Atlanta to Nashville last year, I already had my sights on setting him up as a\
  \ Venture-Captain there. We talked about it last year at Gen Con and he wasn’t prepared\
  \ to take over the reigns. However, five months later, he has decided that he would\
  \ like to see how fast he can grow Pathfinder Society in middle Tennessee. He will\
  \ be our first Venture-Captain in Tennessee and I foresee good things happening\
  \ for the growth of Pathfinder Society in the state.</p> \n    <p>Now, on to the\
  \ second fun event for this week—another holiday blog (and anyone who knows me knows\
  \ how much I love a good brew)! Creative Director James Jacobs wrote the below description\
  \ of Merrymead and you will find a special Pathfinder Society Chronicle sheet you\
  \ can download and apply to a Pathfinder Society character. Merrymead is mentioned\
  \ on page 248 of <a href=\"/products/btpy8ief\"><i>Pathfinder Campaign Setting:\
  \ The Inner Sea World Guide</i></a>.</p> \n    <p>The month of Calistril is much\
  \ anticipated, if only because it signifies the end of winter and the inevitable\
  \ (and usually much welcomed) onset of spring. And no time is more infused with\
  \ this eager anticipation than the second day of the month—a day set aside in most\
  \ areas of the Inner Sea as the holiday known as Merrymead. A key element of Merrymead,\
  \ of course, is the consumption of the last of the previous season’s alcohol. Traditionally,\
  \ this is intended to be little more than a communal sharing of mead supplies (a\
  \ legacy of the holiday’s original origins in central Druma), but today, most celebrants\
  \ use Merrymead as an excuse to get completely smashed on whatever source of booze\
  \ is available. In high societies, aristocrats celebrate with the uncorking of bottles\
  \ specifically set aside for the event, while in the city slums, roving gangs of\
  \ celebrants carouse from bar to bar. It is here that the notorious “mead riots”\
  \ generally happen, when not-quite-drunk-enough merrymakers, faced with the inevitable\
  \ situation of there being more carousers than alcohol, grow violent and destructive.\
  \ Cities with strong histories of mead riots generally draw upon additional troops\
  \ from the militia to help keep the peace... yet sometimes, it can be hard to draw\
  \ upon those troops when they themselves have been looking forward to their own\
  \ Merrymead celebrations!</p> \n    <p>Welcome to our new Venture-Captains and Blesse...\
  \ hic... Happ... hic... fun Merrymead all!</p> \n    <p><s>Click here to download\
