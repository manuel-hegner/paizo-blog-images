  \ (and Didn't Say) About the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game at PaizoCon</h1> \n\
  \    <p class=\"date\">Thursday, June 1, 2017</p> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\"\
  >Every year for the past four years, I have gone onstage at the <a href=\"/paizocon\"\
  >PaizoCon</a> banquet and talked about upcoming releases for the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame\"\
  >Pathfinder Adventure Card Game</a>. This year, that didn't happen. This is because\
  \ I wasn't ready to say what everyone wanted me to say: what the name of the next\
  \ base set is. I do have one in mind, but what we want to do with it isn't something\
  \ we're sure we <i>can</i> do with it.</p> \n    <p>The adventure card game has\
  \ been way more successful than we ever imagined. We're now four base sets, 24 expansion\
  \ decks, four and a half <a href=\"/pfsacg\">Pathfinder Society Adventure Card Guild</a>\
  \ seasons, and 20 Class Decks into the release cycle, and that's not even counting\
  \ the things we've finished but not released. Plus, there's another whole adventure\
  \ card game, <a href=\"http://lonesharkgames.com/games/apocrypha/\" target=\"_blank\"\
  >Apocrypha</a>, that my company Lone Shark Games is about to release, and it does\
  \ some things in different ways than the Pathfinder ACG does. We'd be fools not\
  \ to learn from all of that. So here are our plans.</p> \n    <h2>What We Expect\
  \ to Do With the Next Base Set</h2> \n    <p>Each PACG Adventure Path is massive.\
  \ To play it you have to make a huge commitment: $180 at retail. And playing one\
  \ base set doesn't make playing another any cheaper. Plus, when we change from one\
  \ Organized Play season to the next, we make you crack open a box you might not\
  \ yet own. We have big expensive game boxes and relatively inexpensive tuckboxes,\
  \ but very little in the middle. The big boxes don't fit so great on many retailers'\
  \ shelves, and some retailers put the smaller boxes behind the register, making\
  \ them harder to buy.</p> \n    <p>So we'd like to change the product mix and presentation\
  \ of the game. We're asking ourselves a lot of questions. Do you really need a new\
  \ Cure card every time we start a new storyline? Does every chapter of an adventure\
  \ have to use exactly 110 cards? Is there a way we can introduce a location in Adventure\
  \ 4 and use it again in Adventure 5 without violating the <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ljfr?How-the-Afghanistan-Principle-Affects-Game\"\
  >Afghanistan Principle</a>? What if we want a new Adventure Path to have a lot more\
  \ monsters (or a lot fewer armors) than we put into Rise of the Runelords? Does\
  \ it make sense that scenarios are limited to the number of words we can fit onto\
  \ a single card? Does story really have to be constrained to a couple inches of\
  \ text on a handful of cards?</p> \n    <p>And also: Not every story we want to\
  \ tell is a sprawling Adventure Path that takes RPG characters from 1st-level pipsqueak\
  \ to 20th-level potentate. There are a lot more tales in the Pathfinder catalogue.\
  \ We'd like to be able to tell some of the smaller ones too.</p> \n    <p>If you've\
  \ played a Pathfinder Society Adventure Card Guild game, you know that we've already\
  \ explored some of these questions. PFSACG adventures feature much more story, wildly\
  \ complex scenarios, and deep cross-adventure development. We've even experimented\
  \ with smaller stories in the 2-part Season of the Goblins. And now it's time to\
  \ bring all that to the bigger picture.</p> \n    <p>But it's important to recognize\
  \ that these big changes we're talking about are primarily about presentation, not\
  \ game mechanics. We're not talking \"PACG: Second Edition\" here; we don't need\
  \ to change the rules and mechanics much more than we <i>usually</i> change them\
  \ for a new Base Set. Let's be explicit: we're not going to invalidate your old\
  \ cards. The things we've made so far will play just fine with things from the next\
  \ base set, and we'll give you easy fixes for anything that doesn't, like when we\
  \ changed \"before the encounter\" to \"before you act\" between Rise of the Runelords\
  \ and Skull &amp; Shackles.</p> \n    <p>We have a lot of theories as to how all\
  \ these things will work, and what Adventure Path is best to go with such a rethinking.\
  \ When last week came around, Paizo asked me if I was ready to talk about it. I\
  \ wasn't. So Vic stood up at the banquet and announced that we aren't going to release\
  \ a new base set until Gen Con 2018 at the earliest. We're going to try a lot of\
  \ things; some of them won't work, and that's going to cost us time. And once we\
  \ do figure out what we want, we'll have to make some prototypes: new boxes, a new\
  \ tray... maybe even multiple trays. So maybe the 2018 holiday season is more likely,\
  \ or even Spring 2019. But we won't leave you with a vacuum in the meantime.</p>\
  \ \n    <h2>What We Expect to Do With the Class Decks</h2> \n    <p>We expect to\
  \ continue releasing Class Decks with as many cool ideas as we can think of. Decks\
  \ for August through October went to the printer last week; decks for November through\
  \ February are in active development, and decks for March through May are... um,\
  \ <i>on deck</i>. (We've started unofficially calling them character decks, because\
  \ at best half of the new ones revolve around a single class. Of the next seven\
  \ decks starting in August, only two—<a href=\"/products/btpy9qy9\"><em>Magus</em></a>\
  \ and <a href=\"/products/btpy9sxh\"><em>Hunter</em></a>—are single-Class Decks.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>I talked a little about those two at the PACG seminar at PaizoCon. The\
  \ <em>Magus Class Deck</em> fills a giant hole in the product line, as we don't\
  \ have a focused Arcane/Melee deck. In addition to a new take on Seltyiel, we're\
  \ introducing PACG's first angelkin (you might call her an aasimar), alongside a\
  \ character that has appeared twice in the RPG line. (I'm expecting your guesses\
  \ in the discussion thread!)</p> \n    <p>The <em>Hunter Class Deck</em> is Adowyn's\
  \ set, and it's loaded with animals. In fact, it's a pretty darn good alt-Ranger\
  \ deck, which is one way of addressing another concern of players at PaizoCon: that\
  \ the initial seven Class Decks—the ones that had four characters in them—had a\
  \ smaller set of boons to choose from than the subsequent three-character Class\
  \ Decks. If you want another way to play Harsk, you can get pretty far with the\
  \ <em>Hunter Class Deck</em>. (We're thinking about ways to upgrade those initial\
  \ seven too. Nothing to say yet on that front, but it's in our brains.)</p> \n \
  \   <p>The other five decks in these waves—<a href=\"/products/btpy9s2e\"><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Tales</em></a>, <a href=\"/products/btpy9s2o\"><em>Hell's Vengeance 1</em></a>\
  \ and <a href=\"/products/btpy9sjy\"><em>Hell's Vengeance 2</em></a>, and <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9teh?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Occult-Adventures-Character-Deck-1\"\
  ><em>Occult Adventures 1</em></a> and <em>Occult Adventures 2</em>—let us flex our\
  \ design muscles in ways we've never done. I didn't have much to say at the con\
  \ about <em>Occult Adventures</em> since those decks aren't designed. But I did\
  \ talk about <em>Tales</em>: In addition to the characters of Radovan, Varian, and\
  \ Celeste, <em>Tales</em> has all new allies, and a whole lot of them at that. They\
  \ work together in interesting ways, too. If you like Zae, Keren Rhinn, and Appleslayer\
  \ from <a href=\"/products/btpy9n4o\"><em>Gears of Faith</em></a>, you'll be rewarded\
  \ for keeping them together.</p> \n    <p>The so-called \"evil iconics\" in the\
  \ <em>Hell's Vengeance</em> decks take the more <i>antisocial</i> behavior demonstrated\
  \ by our goblin characters to a new level. And these might be the best characters\
  \ to play in Wrath of the Righteous. On the PACG panel, Pathfinder Society coordinator\
  \ Tonya Woldridge mentioned that the evil characters in PACG are your only opportunity\
  \ for playing evil characters in Pathfinder Society. Speaking of which...</p> \n\
  \    <h2>What We Expect to Do With Organized Play</h2> \n    <p>Tonya unveiled Season\
  \ of Factions' Favor, the next season of PACG Organized Play, which will debut at\
  \ Gen Con in August and conclude at next PaizoCon in May. Plotted by Tonya and John\
  \ Compton, SoFF will weave into the Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild Year of\
  \ Factions' Favor storyline, which in turn will weave into the War for the Crown\
  \ storyline in the Pathfinder Adventure Path line. Season of Factions' Favor will\
  \ use the Mummy's Mask set, just like Season of Plundered Tombs did.</p> \n    <p>SoFF\
  \ will also do something we've never done before: tie new Class Deck releases directly\
  \ into the storyline. A pair of special scenarios will explain exactly how those\
  \ evil <em>Hell's Vengeance</em> folks wind up working for the Pathfinder Society.\
  \ It'll be really cool.</p> \n    <p>That may or may not be the only season we launch\
  \ between now and the next base set. At PaizoCon, I sat down to play the unofficial\
  \ We Are Dragons \"season\" by Tyler Beck and 2017 Pathfinder Society Volunteer\
  \ of the Year David Jacobson, where the main characters are kobolds. I'm not saying\
  \ we're going to make that official, but man, kobolds are wicked fun.</p> \n   \
  \ <h2>What We Expect to Do With the Digital Game</h2> \n    <p>Our partners at Obsidian\
  \ also had some great news at PaizoCon. Their <a href=\"https://pathfinder.obsidian.net\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Pathfinder Adventures app</a>, currently available exclusively\
  \ for iOS and Android phones and tablets, is coming to PC and OS X soon.</p> \n\
  \    <p>And oh man, did the crowd love it when this was revealed:</p> \n    <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20170601-RiseOfTheGoblins.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20170601-RiseOfTheGoblins_500.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Rise of the Goblins will introduce five new scenarios\
  \ inspired by <a href=\"/products/btpy8j5w\"><em>We Be Goblins</em></a> and our\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderSociety/pfsacg/season2b\">Season of the Goblins</a>,\
  \ with Ranzak and Poog of Zarongel as playable characters, plus alternative goblin\
  \ skins for the 11 core iconics. And new asymmetrical goblin dice. If goblins could\
  \ read, they'd be cheering this news right now.</p> \n    <h2>What We Don't Expect\
  \ to Do Any Time Soon</h2> \n    <p>The Starfinder Adventure Card Game, that's what.\
  \ <a href=\"/starfinder\">Starfinder</a> was the buzz of PaizoCon, and all anyone\
  \ could ask me about was whether we were making a Starfinder ACG. I crushed that\
  \ speculation dead on the spot. One of the main reasons we decided to make Pathfinder\
  \ our first adventure card game was the ten thousand or so pieces of awesome Pathfinder\
  \ art that we could use. Starfinder has less than ten thousand pieces of art at\
  \ this point. A <i>lot</i> less. (But it is all awesome. In particular, Remko Troost's\
  \ iconics. Sweet stuff.) With PACG, it also helped that we had great storylines\
  \ to adapt, but the first Starfinder Adventure Path, Dead Suns, won't be completed\
  \ until next June.</p> \n    <p>So, maybe ask me about that next PaizoCon, or the\
  \ one after. Meanwhile, we've got a whole lot of work to do on Pathfinder. Thanks\
  \ for reading, and thanks to PaizoCon for having us there!</p> \n    <p>Mike Selinker<br>\
