  \ \n     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Hi everyone, Roll for\
  \ Combat Director of Game Design Mark Seifter here! 2023 has already been a wild\
  \ year for Roll for Combat and the entire RPG industry, but it’s also the start\
  \ of something exciting: the <a href=\"https://battlezoo.com/products/year-of-monsters-pdf?variant=40610707341412\"\
  ><em>Battlezoo Ancestries: Year of Monsters</em></a>! With <em>Year of Monsters</em>,\
  \ you can play a creative monster ancestry each month of 2023, plus receive a final\
  \ compilation book as a capstone with additional content! </p> \n      <p>The ancestries\
  \ are demons, gremlins, intelligent weapons, dungeons expanded (you can get the\
  \ original dungeon ancestry for free at <a href=\"https://battlezoo.com/products/free-item-battlezoo-ancestries-dungeons?variant=40493131694180\"\
  >https://battlezoo.com/</a>), oni, nymphs, doppelgangers, minotaurs, slimes, sthenos,\
  \ mimics, and sidhe. Each ancestry will receive at least twice as much content as\
  \ a standard-size ancestry, such as those presented in the <em>Pathfinder Core Rulebook</em>\
  \ or <em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Ancestry Guide</em>, and some of them have been expanded\
  \ to add versatile heritages, double-length content, and more surprises! </p> \n\
  \      <p>The <em>Year of Monsters</em> subscription comes with:</p> \n      <ul>\
  \ \n       <li>Thirteen ancestry PDFs—one for each ancestry, and then the expanded\
  \ <em>Year of Monsters Compilation</em> book at the end of the year.</li> \n   \
  \    <li>The Foundry VTT module, which will automatically update itself 13 times\
  \ with the latest ancestries throughout the year.</li> \n       <li>Thirteen ancestry\
  \ files for import into Pathbuilder 2e.</li> \n       <li>No less than 21 digital\
  \ assets for each ancestry.</li> \n       <li>A private invitation to join our design\
  \ team for special design streams, one per month for each ancestry, and have your\
  \ ideas heard as we incorporate them into an expanded compilation at the end of\
  \ the year. </li> \n      </ul> \n      <p>In addition to everything listed above,\
  \ you can get the final compilation book in hardcover at <a href=\"https://battlezoo.com/products/battlezoo-ancestries-year-of-monsters-hardcover-pdf-vtt?variant=40610748465252\"\
  >https://battlezoo.com/</a>.</p> \n      <p>Finally, while we still recommend the\
  \ full experience with Foundry VTT integration and special design streams where\
  \ you can join the design team for the ancestries and have us add your ideas, we\
  \ also want to make <em>Year of Monsters</em> available and affordable to as many\
  \ people as we can. To that end, we’ve worked with one of the Pathfinder 2e discord\
  \ moderators, ink, to put out a special club aimed at new players and old who would\
  \ like just the PDFs and digital assets of <em>Year of Monsters</em> for a lower\
  \ price: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder2e/comments/10dxmgq/rpathfinder2e_group_event_battlezoo_digital/\"\

  \ expensive the Digital Monsters Pledge will be. <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe-QCE0F3Dk8R2n8SfPUS6GzrICa_qdJO5YJM-V-vdZDASwfw/viewform\"\
