  s me, Luis Loza! I am saddened to say that we are at the end of our draconic journey.\
  \ Last week, we took a look at the mighty and benevolent <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sij4?Be-Not-Afraid\"\
  >empyreal dragons</a>. This week, we close out our exploration of dragons by looking\
  \ into the crystal ball and revealing the mysterious omen dragons. Let’s have a\
  \ look!</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/17f6f720-2aee-44b2-ac67-e0bab73e76b2/OccultOmenDragonDesign_3000x1090.png\"\

  \ This dragon has strange, twisting shapes among its body and horns, and sports\

  \ 13px;\">Illustration by Kent Hamilton</p>\n      </div>\n      <br>\n      <p>Omen\
  \ dragons are tied to the occult tradition, granting them strange powers. In the\
  \ case of omen dragons, those powers are connected to prophecy and fortune-telling.\
  \ Although proper prophecy no longer works in the world, short-term fortunes like\
  \ those explored via <em>augury </em>still function. Beyond that, fortunes become\
  \ less accurate, but might still have nuggets of truth within them. It’s these short-\
  \ to medium-length fortunes in which an omen dragon dabbles.</p>\n      <p>Every\
  \ omen dragon is constantly seeing glimpses of possible futures. These dragons’\
  \ occult nature compels them to share what they see with the relevant parties, regardless\
  \ of the people involved or the nature of the future glimpsed. The dragon usually\
  \ shares this future through their prophetic wings. An omen dragon’s wings have\
  \ a reflective inner portion that is much like a mirror. The dragon can use their\
  \ ability to allow another person to glimpse their future, sometimes months into\
  \ the future, within the wings. Since an omen dragon has no other information beyond\
  \ what it shares in the glimpse, they leave the task of deciphering the vision and\
  \ dealing with the future to the people involved.</p>\n      <p>Omen dragons have\
  \ a number of additional abilities tied to the fate and prophecy. Every omen dragon\
  \ is unbound by the restrictions of fate, making them immune to fortune and misfortune\
  \ effects except when the omen dragon chooses to be subject to them. They can also\
  \ twist the immediate future to force misfortune on foes who attempt to attack the\
  \ dragon. Even the breath weapon of an omen dragon is tied to fate and future. An\
  \ omen dragon’s breath grants victims a small taste of an omen dragon’s power, inundating\
  \ the victim with countless visions of possible futures that can overwhelm.</p>\n\
  \      <p>As they’re always seeing these future glimpses, omen dragons often collect\
  \ items and treasures related to the future. Omen dragon hoards tend to be smaller\
  \ than that of a typical dragon, but most omen dragons maintain several hoards at\
  \ once. Most of these hoards hold items of some future importance, such as a weapon\
  \ that will strike down a great power or a relic that can save an entire village.\
  \ People who want or need these items can speak with the dragon in an attempt to\
  \ claim the items, but doing so can be a difficult feat!</p>\n      <p>That’s the\
  \ omen dragon, and with that we’ve finished our look at all the dragons in <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/products/btq02ej4?Pathfinder-Monster-Core\"><em>Monster Core</em></a>!\
  \ The book has been out for a few days now and I’m sure some of you reading this\
  \ already had access to your PDFs or received your physical copies and learned about\
  \ the omen dragon. In a way, you got to see the future before others, making you\
  \ not unlike an omen dragon! I want to thank everyone who followed these draconic\
  \ previews and I hope you’ve had a good time reading them. Also, special thanks\
  \ to Kent Hamilton for his incredible work and being a great collaborator in helping\
  \ create these dragons. These dragons wouldn’t be what they are without him!</p>\n\
  \      <p>As the author for the new dragons, I’ve been excited to talk about them,\
  \ but I’m more excited to hear how everyone uses them in their games. I look forward\
  \ to exciting stories in the months and years to come!</p>\n     </blockquote>\n\
