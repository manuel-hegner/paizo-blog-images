  artist: "one of our favorite artists and creative minds, Downer creator Kyle Stanley\
    \ Hunter. Much as he did in Dungeon, each month Kyle will be giving us his unique\
    \ take on a key monster found in that month's volume of Pathfinder. For \"The\
    \ Skinsaw Murders,\" for instance, he's produced a fearsome ghoul, and future\
    \ adventures will bring ogres, giants, and more. We're all super-excited to have\
    \ Kyle onboard for this and some other super-exciting secret projects a bit farther\
    \ down the road, and for those of you unfamiliar with his work, I highly recommend\
    \ checking out Downer: Wandering Monster or his personal website at www.superunicorn.com/kyle/,\
    \ both of which contain galleries featuring dozens more of his trademark \"mini\
    \ monsters.\" James Sutter Assistant Editor, Pathfinder"
