  \ \n     <blockquote> \n      <p>Hello everyone!</p> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\"\
  >Wow, as of the time I’m writing this the last couple weeks have been eventful,\
  \ to say the least. One event that would be an absolute shame to overlook is this,\
  \ the <em>Guns &amp; Gears</em> author blog! Below are an array of the freelancers\
  \ who helped make <em>Guns &amp; Gears</em> possible. I want to note not everyone\
  \ involved had the time to write or submit an introduction for themselves, so please\
  \ keep an eye on the credits of the final book to see everyone else who helped make\
  \ this project possible!</p> \n      <p>I do want to call special attention to one\
  \ freelancer who is both an incredibly strong author and designer and who won’t\
  \ get the recognition she deserves unless I use this opportunity to give it her\
  \ but let me open with a bit of a story. In publishing, sometimes things go wrong—\
  this is especially true when you’re undertaking back-to-back ambitious projects\
  \ like <em>Secrets of Magic</em> and <em>Guns &amp; Gears</em> that are looking\
  \ to use new and unique templates or delivery methods for conveying information.\
  \ Without getting too lost in the weeds, let me just note that basically all those\
  \ things that can go wrong did go wrong at some point or another over the course\
  \ of this project. One result of this was that we had to reimagine the presentation\
  \ of quite a few elements in <em>Guns &amp; Gears</em> during development.</p> \n\
  \      <p>Now, Jessica Redekop was absolute dynamite during this project. She provided\
  \ insights and assistance to less experienced authors and designers, was an unfailing\
  \ voice of support and positivity, and turned over some incredibly cool design work.\
  \ Sadly, <em>none</em> of that work appears in <em>Guns &amp; Gears</em>. Through\
  \ no fault of her own, all of Jessica’s work ended up being in sections of the book\
  \ that were heavily reworked in ways that required us to cut her submissions. I’\
  ve done what I can to make sure at least some of those submissions make their way\
  \ into other books so you’ll still get to see the incredible work Jess did, but\
  \ I want to take this moment to note that even though none of her words appear in\
  \ this book and she is not credited as a writer, Jess is very much a part of the\
  \ team that made <em>Guns &amp; Gears</em> the (in my humble opinion) incredible\
  \ book it is.</p> \n      <p>With that out of the <em>way</em>, this blog is already\
  \ way longer than it’s probably supposed to be, so I’m going to shut my digital\
  \ mouth and let my amazing freelancers speak for themselves!</p>\n      <p> </p>\n\

  \   <h3>Jessica Catalan</h3> \n      <p>Hi everyone! My name is Jessica and I’m\
  \ a full-time freelance author. I’ve contributed to over thirty projects for Paizo,\
  \ including <em>Secrets of Magic</em>, <em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em>, <em>Tech\
  \ Revolution</em>, “The Gilded Cage,” and <em>PFS #3-99: Fate in the Future</em>.\
  \ My upcoming releases include <em>Lost Omens Grand Bazaar</em>, <em>Book of the\
  \ Dead</em>, <em>SFS #4-09: Through Sea and Storm</em>, and <em>Galactic Magic</em>!</p>\
  \ \n      <p>I wrote a wide range of material for <em>Guns &amp; Gears</em>, including\
  \ feats, vehicles, cursed and intelligent guns, a bunch of fun gizmos, and (my personal\
  \ favorite) the dwarves of Dongun Hold. Contributing to this project was a blast\
  \ and I hope it inspires.</p> \n      <br> \n      <h3>Andrew D. Geels</h3> \n \
  \     <p>Hi everyone! My name is Andrew D. Geels, and I wrote a number of items,\
  \ hazards, and siege engines for Guns &amp; Gears. I’ve been freelance writing for\
  \ Paizo for a couple years now, starting back with “Rise of New Thassilon.” In addition\
  \ to writing, I stream a variety of stuff at twitch.tv/pinstripedbarbarian where\
  \ we’re currently going through The Slithering on Friday nights. I also have a blog\
  \ at pinstripedbarbarian.com where I discuss all sorts of game design topics and\
  \ share a bunch of character and monster designs. You can find me on Twitter <a\
  \ href=\"https://twitter.com/pinbarbarian\">@pinbarbarian</a>.</p> \n      <br>\
  \ \n      <h3>Dustin Knight</h3> \n      <p>Greetings, Pathfinders! I’m honored\
  \ to have the opportunity to pen such entries as the Bullet Dancer archetype and\
  \ the Lucky Draw Bandolier. Working together on this project with so many talented\
  \ creators was incredible! I’m a blogger on the Know Direction Network, PFS Venture\
  \ Lieutenant in King County, and host a Pathfinder Twitch Show every Tuesday and\
  \ Friday! You can check out more of my work on DriveThru RPG, the 52-IN-52! Project,\

  \ Loza</h3> \n      <p>Hey, there! Luis here! It’s me, that developer who works\
  \ on the Lost Omens line. I got to do quite a bit of work for <em>Guns &amp; Gears</em>,\
  \ most notably writing the automaton ancestry. I’ve always loved big robots and\
  \ getting to update the automatons I originally wrote for 1E was a great time. I\
  \ hope everyone has fun playing them! If you want to check out some of my other\
