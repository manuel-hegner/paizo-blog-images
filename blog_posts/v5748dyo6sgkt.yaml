  \ \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">We're now over a month into our Iconic Encounters\
  \ web series, so it's only natural that we'd get to Lini, the iconic gnome druid,\
  \ sooner rather than later. This week's piece of flash fiction from James L. Sutter\
  \ finds the intrepid adventurer alone in the Darklands with only her faithful companion,\
  \ Droogami, to aid her in battling a sinister, fleshwarped foe.</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  \     Lini ducked just as the spider-lady flung a gob of green acid. It spattered\
  \ across Droogami’s fur instead, sending up a waft of sickly acrid smoke. The leopard\
  \ snarled, contorting in pain. \n     <p>“Droo! Don’t bite it!” Lini closed her\
  \ eyes, stretching out her mind-hands to feel for the big cat’s wound. There—a twisted,\
  \ blackened feeling, like the trail of a summer wildfire. She reached out to the\
  \ life around her, begging and borrowing from the mushrooms and water bugs of the\
  \ strange cave, redirecting their shared energy. In her mind’s eye, she pictured\
  \ rain pattering down across that forest scar, feeding dormant seeds, calling forth\
  \ the first green shoots of regrowth. </p>\n     <p>She opened her eyes. Where the\
  \ acid had burned, the leopard’s flesh had healed to gray-pink scar tissue, already\
  \ beginning to sprout fur. </p>\n     <p>Droogami yowled again. </p>\n     <p>“\
  Oh, hush! It’ll grow out!” Lini turned back just in time to dodge a swipe of the\
  \ arachnid abomination’s claws. </p>\n     <p>The fleshwarp shouted something in\
  \ a language that sounded like snapping twigs, but that Lini was pretty sure <i>wasn’\
  t</i> the language of twigs. If twigs could speak to anyone, Lini was fairly confident\
  \ they’d talk to <i>her</i>, not this gross spider-lady. </p>\n     <p>And she really\
  \ was gross. Who’d ruin a perfectly good giant spider by fusing half an elf to it?\
  \ Let alone a rude one like this. </p>\n     <p>One of the spear-like spider legs\
  \ shot out, catching Droogami in the chest and flinging the cat sideways against\
  \ the wall. Droogami hissed and surged back to his feet. </p>\n     <p><i>Definitely</i>\
  \ rude. Lini fell back toward the mushroom patch and reached for the green essence\
  \ that flowed through nature. </p>\n     <p>Not, like, <i>literal</i> green—everything\
  \ growing in these caves was purple or glow-pink or fishbelly white. But it was\
  \ all still part of the green within Lini, Droogami, and even the fleshwarped dark\
  \ elf: the endless cycles of the natural world that bound all things. The things\
  \ that grew down here might not match the hills and forests she was used to, but\
  \ that didn’t matter. Being a druid meant finding the natural in everything. You\
  \ took your forest with you. She reached out to all the little lives—the skittish\
  \ minds of the crawlers and burrowers, the sleeping spirits of the fungus, the unseen\
  \ parasites in their water-drop empires—and asked for help. </p>\n     <p>They answered\
  \ in a rush, vines bursting forth from nowhere to tangle the dark elf aberration’\
  s legs. She screeched and fell sideways, slashing with her claws, but for every\
  \ vine she severed three more took hold. She turned toward Lini, one fist wreathed\
  \ in black flame. </p>\n     <p>Droogami pounced, landing on the angry arachnid\
  \ from above and driving her down into the writhing mass. The vines immediately\
  \ wrapped him up as well—there was only so much discretion you could ask from a\
  \ plant, magical or otherwise—but unlike the spider-lady, he had no interest in\
  \ breaking free. As the vines bound them closer together, he snarled and took the\
  \ dark elf’s neck in his mouth, biting down just hard enough to draw blood. </p>\n\
  \     <p>The fleshwarp went still, flame winking out as she took the hint. </p>\n\
  \     <p>“Sorry about his breath,” Lini observed in the language of elves. She picked\
  \ her way closer, hopping from mushroom to mushroom. “I’ve tried to show him how\
  \ to scrape his teeth with twigs, but he’s too stubborn. And you wouldn’t <i>believe</i>\
  \ some of the things he’s eaten down here.” She wrinkled her nose. “Or maybe you\
  \ would. I don’t know what you believe. That’s your business.” She seated herself\
  \ cross-legged at the edge of the vines. </p>\n     <p>Through the waving tendrils,\
  \ the spider-lady watched the gnome with angry, unblinking eyes. Lini drew her scythe,\
  \ tapping it thoughtfully against her cheek. </p>\n     <p>“<i>My</i> business,\
  \ on the other hand, is finding where those slavers took our friends. And since\
  \ Droogami here can smell them on you, we’d like to ask you a few questions...”\
  \ </p>\n    </blockquote> \n    <p>If you liked this week's Iconic Encounter, you\
