  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">As\
  \ I write this, the brand new <a href=\"/products/btpy909j\">Legends of Golarion</a>\
  \ set is in retail stores and in the hands of or on the way to subscribers. WizKids\
  \ is hard at work on the next set, January's <a href=\"/products/btpy91pu\">Wrath\
  \ of the Righteous</a>, and today they've also announced the NEXT full set in the\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids\">Pathfinder Battles</a> line,\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy92s9\">Reign of Winter</a>. Reign of Winter is set to\
  \ release in April, and will contain 55 figures inspired by <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/reignOfWinter\"\
  >that wintry Adventure Path</a>. It will also include a brand new <a href=\"/products/btpy8yj4\"\
  >Gargantuan White Dragon</a> figure as a promotional case incentive piece, but I'll\
  \ talk more about that when I have an actual image to show you. Suffice it to say\
  \ for now that the figure will be based on one of the most gorgeous and impressive\
  \ pieces of draconic art in Paizo's arsenal of awesome art.</span></p> \n    <p>But\
  \ April is a long way away, and we've still got a ton of <a href=\"/products/btpy91pu\"\
  >Wrath of the Righteous</a> figures to preview before January. So let's get this\
  \ demon-show on the left-hand path, shall we?</p> \n    <p>This week I want to focus\
  \ primarily on Baphomet, demon lord of beasts and labyrinths. This creature has\
  \ a long history in fantasy gaming, and an even longer history in real world mythology.\
  \ Golarion's version mixes elements of the beast's occult design (by way of Eliphas\
  \ Levi) with Baphomet's traditional role as founder of the minotaur race to create\
  \ one of the major antagonists of the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/wrathOfTheRighteous\"\
  >Wrath of the Righteous</a> Adventure Path. I've already revealed <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lf8v\"\
  >a look at the unpainted Baphomet sculpt</a>, but today I'm pleased to reveal the\
  \ creature's wicked paint master.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderBattles/20131025-Baphomet_500.jpeg\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20131025-Baphomet_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Baphomet is a (very) Large, rare figure.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20131025-Minotaur2_500.jpeg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20131025-Minotaur2_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>And since Baphomet is the Lord of Minotaurs, it only\
  \ made sense to include a new Minotaur in this set. We previously released a <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy8qjh\">Minotaur</a> in our very first set, <a href=\"/products/btpy8mq6\"\
  >Heroes &amp; Monsters</a>. And while that version was perfectly fine, he always\
  \ seemed a bit runty to me, so I decided to take this opportunity to add a new one\
  \ to the line. This new Minotaur is a Large, uncommon figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20131025-Hepzamirah_500.jpeg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20131025-Hepzamirah_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Speaking of minotaurs, here we have Hepzamirah, the\
  \ Daughter of Baphomet and an imposing enemy in her own right. A unique nephilim\
  \ NPC, Hepzamirah is one of Baphomet's most favored servants and a major antagonist\
  \ in the <a href=\"/products/btpy91pu\">Wrath of the Righteous</a> campaign. She\
  \ could easily double as some sort of half-minotaur or unique demon as well. The\
  \ sculpt on this figure is absolutely incredible. Hepzamirah is a Large, rare figure.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-Minagho_500.jpeg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-Minagho_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>This here is Minagho, a lilitu demon rogue who serves\
  \ as one of the key villains of the Adventure Path. She doesn't have much to do\
  \ with Baphomet, but she does have horns, so I'm including her in this week's batch.\
  \ The eyeless Lilitu demons are born from foul spirits of temptation, and this one\
  \ in particular has specialized in the corruption of faith. Minagho is a Medium,\
  \ rare figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-BaphometCultist_500.jpeg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-BaphometCultist_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Every evil demon lord needs a cultist.\
  \ In the case of Baphomet, they tend to take the form of warriors wearing horned\
  \ helmets and wielding elaborate pole arms. This evil figure will help to fill out\
  \ your Abyssal armies, but also doubles as a credible female pole-arm-wielding player\
  \ character or even a non-evil soldier (if you absolutely must). The Baphomet Cultist\
  \ is a Medium, common figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-DeskariCultist_500.jpeg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-DeskariCultist_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Last up this week is the Deskari Cultist,\
  \ a scythe-wielding maniac who has sworn his eternal soul to Deskari, demon lord\
  \ of locusts (more on him in a future preview). This figure also lacks horns, but\
  \ he makes up for it with elaborate engravings on his chitinous armor. He's cool,\
  \ he's Medium, and he's common.</p> \n    <p>And that's it for this week. Tune in\
  \ next Friday for another look at upcoming figures from the <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids\"\
