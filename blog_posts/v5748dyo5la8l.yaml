  \ align=\"left\" hspace=\"12\">\n   <br> \n   <p><b>Lou Agresta</b><br> Fantasy\
  \ game design crept up on Lou Agresta in 2005, when diamondthrone.com accepted his\
  \ first articles on true names. Until then a writer of travelogues, indie comics,\
  \ fashion essays, and torturous, self-indulgent philosophy tracts, his more recent\
  \ adventure credits include SAW #1 and #12 of the Trodoon Gate Saga (LPJ Designs),\
  \ <i>The Bloody Fix</i> and <i>The Punctured Vein</i> with Rone Barton (O0negames),\
  \ and Pathfinder Society Scenario #8: <i>Slave Pits of Absalom</i>. Lou is one of\
  \ six authors from the Great City Campaign Setting (0onegames), a contributor to\
  \ Sinister Adventures, and chief-scribbler over at the RPGAggression blog. A member\
  \ of the Werecabbages freelance writer's guild, he also had his fingers in both\
  \ the GM Gems and PC Pearls collaborations (Goodman Games) and has made guest appearances\
  \ as Cthu-Lou on the Atomic Array podcast. Lou's set piece, slated for Pathfinder\
  \ #24, will likely prove the last of its kind. <i>Dungeon</i> acquired his first\
  \ adventure, written with Nicolas Logue, then canceled the magazine, leaving Lou\
  \ forever haunted by the fear he is somehow responsible. Lou lives somewhere in\
  \ upstate NY with his wife, daughter, a dog, and a couple of horses. While he has\
  \ sometimes worn a kilt and ridden a tractor, no one has ever caught him doing both.</p>\

  \ was born in Japan and raised in the United States. He started gaming when the\
  \ red Basic D&amp;D boxed set came out. Rob currently lives in Prague, Czech Republic,\
  \ where he is an English teacher by day and freelancer by night. Rob made it to\
  \ last year's RPG Superstar Top 4 with a combination of coin belts, ziggurat-filled\
  \ jungles, and monkey-goblins. Thus far he has contributed to the <i>Pathfinder\
  \ Chronicles Campaign Setting</i>, several <i>Pathfinder</i> Bestiaries, and the\
  \ upcoming <i>Dungeon Denizens Revisited</i>. Rob is currently scrambling to finish\
  \ writing the final installment of the upcoming Legacy of Fire Adventure Path, \"\
  The Final Wish.\"</p> \n   <br clear=\"all\">\n   <br>\n   <img src=\"/image/content/RPGSuperstar/JasonNelson.jpg\"\

  \ is in the job market as a professor of education (have doctorate, will travel!)\
  \ and a devoted Christian who lives in Seattle, Washington with his two kids, Allen\
  \ and Meshia, and has been gaming since 1981. He's hardcore enough that he uses\
  \ the name of his first-ever D&amp;D character, Tjaden, in his email address, and\
  \ he's also devious enough to have slipped the name of his fiancee into the <i>Pathfinder\
  \ Chronicles Campaign Setting</i>, to her great amusement and delight. Jason was\
  \ some combination of lucky and good enough to make the Final Four in the inaugural\
  \ RPG Superstar and has also written a number of adventures and articles for <i>Dungeon</i>\
  \ and <i>Dragon</i> magazines (ah, memories) and over a hundred webcolumns for Wizards\
  \ of the Coast, including the long-running \"Save My Game\" and \"Behind the Screen.\"\
  \ More recently, he has contributed to <i>Dungeon Denizens Revisited</i> and several\
  \ <i>Pathfinder</i> Bestiaries, co-wrote <i>Osirion: Land of the Pharaohs</i>, and\
  \ is the author of \"The End of Eternity\", the fourth adventure in the Legacy of\
  \ Fire Adventure Path. It's awesome! You should totally go buy a copy!</p> \n  \

  \ the shadow of North Carolina's Blue Ridge mountains, Neil Spicer started gaming\
  \ in the early '80s. His first foray into RPG design began with a simple fanzine\
  \ devoted to Alternity's Star*Drive and Dark.Matter campaign settings titled Action\

  \ <p>Below is just a small sampling of the events you can expect to see and participate\
  \ in at PAIZOCON 2009. Event sign-ups will go live in May. We still have a few badges\
  \ left—don't be left out, buy yours today! In addition to the events below, Pathfinder\
  \ Society members of all levels and experience will be able to participate in a\
  \ Friday night interactive penned by Erik Mona and Joshua J. Frost that's sure to\
  \ keep people talking for years!</p> \n   <p><b>Pathfinder Society Scenario #23:<br><i>Tide\
  \ of Morning</i> by Steven Robert (for Tier 1–5)</b><br> Venture-Captain Dennel\
  \ Hamshanks sends you to convince an Andoren druid named Hemzel to allow the Pathfinder\
  \ Society to study his recently discovered lorestone, a minor magical item that\
  \ unlocks some of the mysteries of the ancient Andoren druid circles. When you arrive\
  \ and find Hemzel murdered and the lorestone missing, you must race against time\
  \ to recover the lorestone and stop Hemzel's murderers from using it against the\
  \ druids of Andoran.</p> \n   <p><b>Pathfinder Society Scenario #24:<br><i>The Decline\
  \ of Glory</i> by Tim Hitchcock (for Tier 1–7)</b></p> When the son of a famous\
  \ Pathfinder gains control of his father's holdings in Taldor, the Pathfinder Society\
  \ decides to build a new lodge there as a base to explore the many ruins of that\
  \ crumbling empire. Unfortunately, the Taldan Phalanx has its eye on the holdings\
  \ and an ancient curse has turned many of the residents into the walking dead. Can\
  \ you survive the tangled web of Taldor's politics and fight off the echoes of the\
  \ past or will you, too, see your glory decline?\n   <p></p> \n   <p><b>Pathfinder\
  \ Society Scenario #25:<br><i>Hands of the Muted God</i> by Clinton J. Boomer (for\
  \ Tier 5–9)</b><br> When the man who would be the Muted God wordlessly stepped beyond\
  \ the gates of the Starstone's Cathedral, his thousand and one faithful ringing\
  \ the Ascendant Court watched with the silent contemplation that is their highest\
  \ sacrament. When he failed to emerge, many of his penitents abandoned their vows\
  \ but a small sect remained loyal and worshipful. You and your fellow Pathfinders\
  \ are sent into the mountains north of Absalom to follow the path of a doomed party\
  \ and uncover the secrets of the Muted God. His loyal band of followers, called\
  \ the Hand, will stop at nothing to keep you away from their shrine—even forming\
  \ an alliance with some of Golarion's most evil denizens.</p> \n   <p><b>Pathfinder\
  \ Society Scenario #26:<br><i>Lost at Bitter End</i> by Joshua J. Frost (for Tier\
  \ 7–11)</b><br> When a Pathfinder Society Priest of Nethys disappears in northern\
  \ Geb while studying the Mana Wastes, the Society sends you to uncover his whereabouts\
  \ and find his journals. Arriving in the town of Bitter End, you find it deserted\
  \ but for a few mysterious creatures never before seen on Golarion. Those creatures\
  \ quickly lead to more and soon you're embroiled in a mystery that could affect\
  \ the very fabric of reality. Will you solve the mystery of Bitter End or find yourself\
  \ lost forever in the Mana Wastes?</p> \n   <p><b>Cursed Lot: New Beginnings, GMed\
  \ by Jason Bulmahn</b><br> Last year, a group of brave, but horribly cursed adventurers\
  \ set out on a brave adventure. While one succeeded to be rid of his terrible curse,\
  \ the rest suffered and even worse fate. This year, a new band of unfortunately\
  \ cursed heroes takes on an even greater challenge... to rescue a missing dog. How\
  \ hard could that be?</p> \n   <p><b>Fires Over Brinestump, GMed by James Jacobs</b><br>\
  \ It's been three years since the last time goblins have been a problem on the Lost\
  \ Coast, but last night, a band of Licktoad Goblins from the Brinestump Marsh lit\
  \ a merchant wagon on fire. The lone survivior almost made it to the town of Sandpoint\
  \ before dying of his burns, and shortly after his body is discovered, fireworks\
  \ bloom over Brinestump Marsh, lighting the night sky south of Sandpoint in an unmistakable\
  \ display of goblin celebration. Why are the Licktoad Goblins on the march? Who\
  \ gave them fireworks? Does this herald the advent of another goblin invasion of\
  \ the town of Sandpoint? A Pathfinder RPG adventure for six 1st level characters.</p>\
  \ \n   <p><b>Into the Scarlet Monastery, GMed by Sean K Reynolds</b> The zealots\
  \ of the Scarlet Monastery have been a blight on the world for three years. Reviled\
  \ by all, they hate against all nonhumans, accuse their enemies of spreading plague,\
  \ and lynch innocents in the name of their crusade. Now is the time to defeat their\
  \ Commander. But are two orc warriors, a troll mage, a warlock, an undead rogue,\
  \ and a minotaur druid up to the task?</p> \n   <p><b>Before Nightfall, a PFPRG\
  \ Playtest for a work in progress, GMed by F. Wesley Schneider</b><br> Forsaken,\
  \ some places are best left to their haunted memories and the shadows of things\
  \ best left forgotten. On the Ustalavic frontieer, one such ruin has long loomed\
  \ over the lives and nightmares of the local peasents, a monument to terrors that\
  \ can never be forgotten. Now a terrible new life has returned to the dreaded citadel,\
  \ one that seeks to renew the horrors of centuries past. Take up arms and explore\
  \ the deadly grounds and labyinthine courtyards of a soon to be infamous gothic\
  \ castle, offer your advice and feedback on what makes for exciting horror roleplaying,\
  \ and participate in the creation of a terrifying new adventure written in the tradition\
  \ of one of the most famous horror RPG modules of all time.</p> \n   <p><b>Short\
  \ Fiction Workshop</b><br> Paizo Fiction Editor James L. Sutter and Editor Christopher\
  \ Paul Carey critique your short fiction! James and Chris will critique your story\
  \ from an editorial viewpoint and go over it with you, focusing especially on the\
  \ opening and those red flags editors use to quickly reject stories, helping you\
  \ hone your writing and make it past an editor's initial cut. Please note that workshopping\
  \ will be on a first-come, first-served basis during the listed timeslot—you can\
  \ sign up so you don't have to wait around the whole time.</p> \n   <p><b>Pathfinder\
  \ Society Scenario Open Call Workshop</b><br> A future Pathfinder Society Scenario\
  \ for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game will be decided on at PAIZOCON 2009! Soon,\
  \ Paizo's Events Manager Joshua J. Frost will put out an open call for one of the\
  \ fall Pathfinder Society Scenarios—a call that can only be answered by attendees\
  \ at PAIZOCON 2009! All who contributed may attend this workshop where Joshua will\
  \ go over why each scenario was and wasn't accepted. For a unique look inside the\
  \ creative mind of the guy who brings you your monthly installment of Pathfinder\
  \ Society scenarios, look no further than this seminar! This event will be capped\
  \ at 20 attendees.</p> \n   <p>... and much, much more! Don't delay—sign up for\
  \ PAIZOCON 2009 today!</p> \n   <p> Joshua J. Frost <br>Events Manager</p> \n  </blockquote>\
