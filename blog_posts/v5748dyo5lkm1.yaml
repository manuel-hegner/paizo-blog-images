  \ </div> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Ever since the first Pathfinder Adventure\
  \ Card Game Class Decks were released, you have been able to use Adventure Path\
  \ characters of the same class as your deck in the <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/acg\"\
  >Pathfinder Society Adventure Card Guild</a>. This has been a great way to add more\
  \ variety to PFSACG character options (in case the 88 Class Deck characters aren't\
  \ already enough for you!).</p> \n    <p>The latest version of the <em>Pathfinder\
  \ Society Adventure Card Guild Guide</em> extends this to work with decks that contain\
  \ characters of more than one class. For example, since the <em>Pathfinder Tales\
  \ Character Deck</em> contains a wizard, you can use Ezren with that deck. And certain\
  \ PFSACG adventure rewards unlock the ability to use specific characters with specific\
  \ decks.</p> \n    <p>So, I decided to make a list of all the additional characters\
  \ that you can use with each deck, including those you can only unlock with Chronicle\
  \ sheets or boons. Every Class and Character deck has at least one additional playable\
  \ character!</p> \n    <ul>\n     <li><i>Alchemist Class Deck</i>: Damiel (Skull\

  \ \n    <p>Whew! That's a lot of possibilities! Some of these options are total\
  \ win for the characters, such as unlocking the Hunter deck for any Ranger. But\
  \ there are a few that are more strange and interesting. Let's talk about a few\
  \ of these, shall we?</p> \n    <p>The <em>Pathfinder Tales</em> deck has the most\
  \ new options. The deck contains Varian (a wizard), Radovan (a rogue), and Celeste\
  \ (a sorcerer). The Wizard, Rogue and Sorcerer Class decks are among the first that\
  \ were released, so they didn't include any cards from some of the more recent base\
  \ sets. The Tales deck has plenty of new cards, so let's see what fun things we\
  \ can do giving those cards to a character who has otherwise been left a bit behind\
  \ as far as card selection goes: Seoni from Wrath of the Righteous.</p> \n    <p>Seoni's\
  \ Element Master role works best with spells that have the Acid, Cold, Electricity\
  \ or Fire traits, of which the Tales deck includes many. When you choose this role,\
  \ she gains a free power to reduce damage of a type matching one of these traits.\
  \ She can also take a feat to add a flat +4 to her checks that have one of those\
  \ traits, and another feat to let her auto-recharge items with those traits, so\
  \ items like Necklace of Fireballs and Wand of Flame are excellent choices for her.</p>\

  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PZO6822-AcadamaeScholar_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n     <p>You can just imagine Seoni's delight when she finds this wand in\
  \ some dark dungeon.</p>\n    </div> \n    <p>Has your Seoni been frustrated by\
  \ the Trigger trait in either of the Mummy's Mask-based seasons? Grab the Tales\
  \ ally Eando Kline, who gives you the ability to ignore non-villain Trigger powers.\
  \ Or pick up the duo of Acadamae Student and Acadamae Scholar, who work together\
  \ to make your Arcane checks oh-so-good. Or grab Jelani or Isiem, who can add the\
  \ Cold or Fire trait to your combat check with a simple recharge. And there's a\
  \ Blessing of the Elements in the Tales deck, an obvious choice for fiery Seoni.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Next, let's take a look at the new Occult Adventures decks. Both include\
  \ characters from the <em>Mummy's Mask Base Set</em>, including <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ljbw?That-One-Time-I-Lied-About-My-Best-Character\"\
  >my best character ever</a>. Mavaro can be played using any of <i>four</i> other\
  \ class decks, so he has had access to plenty of excellent boons throughout his\
  \ long and storied career. However, some of the boons in <em>Occult Adventures 2</em>\
  \ are just too perfect for him to pass up.</p> \n    <p>For example, Mavaro has\
  \ his own sword, The Missing Eye. It's a fine weapon, and is especially good at\
  \ taking out demons. And it gives him a bonus on Fortitude or Perception checks\
  \ when he really needs it. Even better, if he displays it, he gains four useful\
  \ skills equal to his Intelligence: Strength, Melee, Wisdom and Divine. If you'd\
  \ like to use him as a spellcaster, there are some excellent spells that use his\
  \ Knowledge or Perception for effects or recharge checks, both of which he has a\
  \ bonus to, such as Mind Thrust, Object Reading, and Kinetic Blast.</p> \n    <div\

  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PZO6827-ShrunkenHead_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n     <p>There are a lot of reasons why Mavaro is my favorite character,\
  \ but I think the top one is his rockin' dad bod.</p>\n    </div> \n    <p>Have\
  \ you found yourself taking a bunch of Mental damage that can't be reduced? You\
  \ should really pick up the Crystal Mail, which will let you recharge those cards\
  \ instead of discarding them. Or perhaps you could hang the Shrunken Head on your\
  \ belt, letting you ignore a monster's powers that happen before you act. Also check\
  \ out the Mindblade, who lets you use your Perception skill for your combat check.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>I hope I've convinced you already of the potential value of some of these\
  \ deck unlocks, but now let's really go off the deep end with the Hell's Vengeance\
  \ character decks! I'm going to start with Deck 2, which contains Zelhara the Inquisitor,\
  \ thereby allowing us to use Imrijka from Wrath of the Righteous. In her quest to\
  \ root out evil and corruption, Imrijka has never been afraid to use tactics that\
  \ might make some people squirm, so I can imagine she would embrace some less-than-legal\
  \ items if she got hold of them, and that's exactly what the <em>Hell's Vengeance\
  \ 2</em> deck does for her.</p> \n    <p>First, there are a ton of great Ranged\
  \ weapons that she can use her unique Ranged: Strength +1 skill with, such as the\
  \ Galvanic Chakram +1, the Spirit Blade, or my favorite, the Stalker's Crossbow.\
  \ Of course, that crossbow has the Corrupted trait, but there are ways that Imrijka\
  \ can get around the penalties that trait imposes, like the Redeemer Blacksmith\
  \ or the Channel Corruption spell.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a\
  \ href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PZO6020-ImrijkaCharacterFront.jpg\"\

  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PZO6824-BladeLash_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n     <p>Imrijka has never been too concerned with getting her hands dirty,\
  \ and using a Corrupted weapon for the sake of good intentions is still good, right?\
  \ Guys? Where are you going?</p>\n    </div> \n    <p>Excellent spells like Blade\
  \ Lash and Steal Soul are here for the taking as well. The Sniper's Studded Leather,\
  \ Shackles of Compliance, and Robe of Bones are all fantastic items that Imrijka\
  \ can use to streak fear into her enemies, and those animated Undead allies... well,\
  \ she normally wouldn't make use of those as a Pharasmin, but desperate times call\
  \ for desperate measures.</p> \n    <p>Last but not least, let's look at <em>Hell's\
  \ Vengeance 1</em>. This deck includes Lazzero, a cleric of Asmodeus. He's evil\
  \ and grouchy and people just generally don't like him much, but perhaps there's\
  \ another cleric that can bring some divine light into this deck? I'm talking about\
  \ Kyra, my friends. No, not Drelm. Kyra. Yes, you heard me right.</p> \n    <p>Kyra\
  \ is a goody-two-shoes, and everyone knows it. She's a staunch supporter of Sarenrae,\
  \ hates dead things, and tries to bring light and happiness to all. But not this\
  \ Kyra. Maybe this version of Kyra lost the love of her life Merisiel in a fight\
  \ with a vampire, and was turned by that vampire to serve his dark bidding? However\
  \ it happened, this is not the undead-hating Sarenrae-loving Kyra we all know and\
  \ love... this is something else, and there are plenty of ways for her to get out\
  \ her newfound aggression using <em>Hell's Vengeance 1</em>. Interested in using\
  \ a flaming hammer to strike down some weaklings? Check out Sinderbos, and maybe\
  \ boost your combat with a fun spell like Instrument of Agony or Circle of Evil.\
  \ Or perhaps just burn them to death with your Hellfire Halo.. </p> \n    <div class=\"\

  ></a> \n     <p>Look into her eyes and tell me there's a shred of decency left in\
  \ her. Oops, you probably shouldn't have looked <b>directly</b> into her eyes...</p>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>There are fun allies to capture, like the devil Suurlahetas\
  \ or the Asmodean High Priest. There are a dizzying array of new Corrupted blessings\
  \ to choose from as well, like the Blessing of the Prince of Lies, which lets you\
  \ bury it and all other cards in your hand to straight up succeed at a check against\
  \ a boon or non-villain bane.</p> \n    <p>Now, I'm not going to lie to you and\
  \ tell you that playing evil Kyra will be easy. Neither the Rise of the Runelords\
  \ nor the Wrath of the Righteous versions of her have as many ways to deal with\
  \ the penalties of Corrupted boons as the characters that come in the deck do, so\
  \ she'll have to rely on things like Channel Corruption and the Redeemer Blacksmith.\
  \ If you're looking for a challenge, though, bringing Kyra over to the dark side\
  \ might just be up your alley.</p> \n    <p>That's it for this edition of \"Tyler\
