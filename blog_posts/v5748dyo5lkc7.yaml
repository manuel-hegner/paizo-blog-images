  \ to Vol—PaizoCon 2018!</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Monday, December 18, 2017</p>\
  \ \n    <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"> \n     <p>In prior years, it seemed that\
  \ we had a distinctive convention season with a slower period during the winter.\
  \ This model doesn't work anymore, as PAX Unplugged extended the season into mid-November,\
  \ and next year pushes it further back into early December, while Martin Luther\
  \ King Junior's birthday weekend is the launch of the new convention season.</p>\
  \ \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">The new season brings with it several Paizo-sponsored\
  \ conventions with a large organized play presence. PaizoCon, Gen Con, Origins,\
  \ as well as travel to other shows such as UK Games Expo, PaizoCon UK, and PaizoCon\
  \ OZ. Planning for these conventions started several months ago. Over the past few\
  \ months, Paizo staff worked hard on updating the Attendance policy. With it completed\
  \ and releasing to the public this month (along with updates the PaizoCon area of\
  \ paizo.com), tickets sales are soon to follow. One of my goals includes offering\
  \ volunteer slots for Paizo-sponsored conventions before the ticket sales open.\
  \ This allows volunteers to make plans with their friends before purchasing tickets.\
  \ Thus, we moved the call for volunteers from its usual February timeslot to today.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>We have a few big changes from last year. We hope this streamline some\
  \ of the processes or bring more options for attendees at the convention.</p> \n\
  \     <p>First, we changed the nomenclature from session or slot to block. Each\
  \ block is 5 hours. This unifies the terminology from the event support form used\
  \ by our event organizers and keeps things consistent across the board.</p> \n \
  \    <p>Second, we ditched using the Tier system to describe how many volunteers.\
  \ It is a RPGA holdover that caused confusion, as the lower number the tier, the\
  \ more slots a person volunteered. Also, we have tiers for our scenarios, so having\
  \ tiers for volunteers caused some confusion in our data. This year, you register\
  \ for the number of 5 hour blocks you wish to volunteer.</p> \n     <p>Third change\
  \ is overnight madness! Following on the success of having overnight games at Gen\
  \ Con 50, we are trying it out at PaizoCon. We will schedule some tables of Pathfinder\
  \ Society or Starfinder Society, but there will be a limited number of tables available\
  \ on a first-come, first-served basis for attendees wishing to play other games.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Fourth, afternoon tables may be submitted to the PaizoCon event system.\
  \ When Sara Marie requests submissions from third parties, feel free to submit items\
  \ for Pathfinder Society or Starfinder Society. Any tables not allocated through\
  \ the system by the time submissions will be available on site with first-come,\
  \ first-served priority.</p> \n     <p>Finally, we are setting a 7 block maximum\
  \ for volunteering. We want people to take a break and see what the convention has\
  \ to offer. PaizoCon is a celebration of Paizo, its staff, and community and we\
  \ want you to experience different aspects of it. Oh, and eat. We really want you\
  \ to have time for food, rest, and showers.</p> \n     <p>Last year, we utilized\
  \ 78 GMs, Card Guild organizers, and HQ volunteers to ensure organized play activities\
  \ at PaizoCon ran smoothly. I anticipate the same needs again this year, depending\
  \ on how many blocks each volunteer requests. We have a few new choices for volunteers\
  \ this year. As we are running overnight games, we will need a handful of GMs to\
  \ run games through the wee hours of the morning. We are also looking for two HQ\
  \ volunteers for the afternoon block to man the information desk and two for the\
  \ overnight block, when they would be manning the info desk but mainly focused reporting\
  \ prior blocks game information. Due to the limited number of places, space fills\
  \ up quickly, so I recommend signing up as soon as you know you can commit to the\
  \ event.</p> \n     <p>Volunteer slots are scheduled as follows:</p> \n     <blockquote>\
