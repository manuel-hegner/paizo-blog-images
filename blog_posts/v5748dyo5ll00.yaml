  \ </div> \n    <p>Hello! We just came back from a highly successful Gen Con, where\
  \ we showed off the newest stuff for the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game, including\
  \ the debut of the <a href=\"/products/btpy9xdn?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Ultimate-Wilderness-AddOn-Deck\"\
  ><em>Ultimate Wilderness Add-On Deck</em></a>. It falls to me to guide you through\
  \ the wonders therein, and I'm thrilled to do so, because it allows me to talk about\
  \ mushrooms.</p> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Yes, <i>mushrooms</i>! The fleshiest,\
  \ most spore-bearing fruiting body of a fungus you'll find in the moistest, least\
  \ welcoming shadows of the forest. I get to tell you all about them, because I'm\
  \ a fun guy. (See, if anyone else on my team had volunteered to do this blog, they\
  \ could have stopped me from making that joke.) [<b>Vic:</b> So very, very tempted\
  \ to delete that, but Erik Mona says not to stand between a man and his puns...\
  \ much.]</p> \n    <p>The reason the subject of mushrooms is so fond to me is that\
  \ there is an epochal divide on the PACG design team. There is one group (headed\
  \ by me, Liz, and Paul) that believes mushrooms are the best! And there is another\
  \ (headed by Chad, Gaby, and Tanis) that believes mushrooms are the <i>actual devil</i>.\
  \ (Keith pretends to split the difference, but we all know he's just placating us\
  \ mushroom enthusiasts.) So those of us who love mushrooms relish any opportunity\
  \ to wax poetical about squishy, fleshy mushrooms in front of the others.</p> \n\
  \    <p>So I shall! The <em>Ultimate Wilderness Deck</em> is filled with them. Here\
  \ are three.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6832-CloudPuff.jpg\"\

  ></a> \n     <p>The delight of mycophagists everywhere.</p>\n    </div> \n    <p>Let's\
  \ address the elephant ear mushroom in the room first: The trait PLANT is not <i>quite</i>\
  \ accurate, since everyone knows mushrooms aren't plants. But we needed things that\
  \ worked on Plants to affect these cards, so we ignored the biological distinction.\
  \ I figure everyone in Golarion thinks mushrooms are plants, even the ones that\
  \ shriek all the time.</p> \n    <p>Once you get past that, you'll love that the\
  \ deck is filled with tons of Plants, all of which have that great kicker on the\
  \ bottom of the card. Basically, these plants don't count as in your hand when you\
  \ set your hand size. So you can have a whole lot of them. They <i>grow</i>, you\
  \ see.</p> \n    <p>There are also some Plant allies as well.</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  \ \n    <p>And if you like having animals around, why not turn into them? We have\
  \ <i>nine</i> new spells of the aspect type we introduced in the <em>Hunter Class\
  \ Deck</em>. The aspects are the first spells to have the Animal trait. They're\
  \ kinda creepy looking, but in a good way.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  >Zova</a>, the iconic shifter. The shifter is straight out of <a href=\"/products/btpy9ujo?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Ultimate-Wilderness\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Wilderness</em></a>, and Zova has been a favorite of\
  \ ours since the R&amp;D team started cooking her up. We started designing this\
  \ deck before the RPG rules were finished, then reconciled things as the shifter...\
  \ well, took shape, as it were.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\

  \ to Zova's hand size. It's the first hand size line with text in it, because Zova\
  \ has the spell Shapechange hardwired into her character. Every turn, you can pick\
  \ your hand size from three (or even five!) options. No more dying because you drew\
  \ too many cards, maybe ever.</p> \n    <p>Then when you get good at playing with\
  \ a variable hand size, you can either blow everything up with Fire and Acid, or\
  \ just be a lycanthrope.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\

  ><em>Ultimate Wilderness Add-On Deck</em></a> is the shiftiest deck we've ever made,\
  \ and we're thrilled to end the Ultimate series with it. Now we're taking a break\
  \ from class decks to focus everything on the new Core Set and Curse of the Crimson\
  \ Throne. Thanks for letting us put out 27 decks in the Class Deck and Add-On lines.\
  \ We hope to make more someday! For now, enjoy <em>Ultimate Wilderness</em>!</p>\
