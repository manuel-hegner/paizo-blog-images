  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">by Adam Heine</p> \n   <h2>Chapter Three: Human Problems</h2>\
  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p>\"Don't answer,\" Allyra hissed.\
  \ \"Where's the back entrance?\"</p> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Before Blit\
  \ could reply, the worm-eaten door crashed open. An enormous green man with incisors\
  \ the size of tent spikes ducked and stepped inside. Odim and two other Banshees\
  \ walked in behind him. Gedrak carried nothing—he didn't really need to—but the\
  \ other three held clubs and torches.</p> \n    <p>\"Well.\" Gedrak looked over\
  \ at Allyra with a frown. \"That's unexpected.\"</p> \n    <p>\"It's not what it\
  \ looks like.\" Blit stepped forward, open hands pleading.</p> \n    <p>Gedrak glowered\
  \ at him like he was a cockroach. \"It looks like you're cheating me, Patch Man.\
  \ I pay you to get rid of evidence, not take it home.\"</p> \n    <p>\"She wasn't\
  \ dead, Gedrak!\" Blit clenched his fists. \"I'm not paid to do your murders for\
  \ you. If your men are too sloppy—\"</p> \n    <p>Gedrak cut him off with one massive\
  \ hand. \"Save it, Blit. We're through with you anyway. Nothing personal. We're\
  \ just tying up loose ends, and that includes patching up the Patch Man.\" He looked\
  \ at Allyra, chuckling at his own stupid joke.</p> \n    <p>Allyra was already halfway\
  \ to him, though, warhammer in the air. Gedrak's surprise lasted only a moment.\
  \ He lurched into the attack, taking most of it on his leathery hide. Then he threw\
  \ a fist like a battering ram into her stomach and knocked her down.</p> \n    <p>She\
  \ coughed, a small amount of blood trickling down her chin. \"Don't worry, Blit.\
  \ I'll get us out of here.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Are you kidding?\" Blit said. \"Just\
  \ stay close and don't... don't do that again.\"</p> \n    <p>Gedrak snapped his\
  \ fingers, and the other thugs rushed toward Blit. But you didn't live your whole\
  \ life as a demonspawn without learning how to dodge a pitchfork (or club, in this\
  \ case, but the principle was the same). Blit ducked and rolled. Then he snatched\
  \ an extract, popped it open, and drank it one smooth motion.</p> \n    <p>Immediately,\
  \ he felt a rush of speed in his legs. He grabbed Allyra and ran at superhuman speed\
  \ toward the room's back door.</p> \n    <p>Odim cut him off. Blit shot a hand into\
  \ his coat, but before he could decide which extract would help him, Allyra—who\
  \ wasn't nearly as injured as she'd looked—slammed her hammer into Odim's chest,\
  \ knocking the wind out of him.</p> \n    <p>Gedrak marched toward them, drawing\
  \ his jagged blade. \"Where you gonna run to? We'll just hunt you, you know. We\
  \ have to clean up all our messes.\"</p> \n    <p>Blit laughed, snapping a fingerful\
  \ of pine dust into a vial behind his back. \"When have you ever cleaned up your\
  \ own mess, Gedrak?\" Then he tossed the vial at the half-orc's feet. It exploded\
  \ in a burst of flame and light. Gedrak howled. Pieces of the wall cracked and crumbled,\
  \ and the whole building groaned ominously.</p> \n    <p>Blit grabbed Allyra's hand\
  \ and dashed past the wounded Odim. The other Banshees ran after them, but they\
  \ were too slow to keep up now. The building's back entrance was locked, but Allyra\
  \ smashed it open with no trouble. Then Blit whipped together another incendiary\
  \ cocktail and, when they were well into the street, tossed it back into the building\
  \ where it detonated on impact. The doorframe and most of the stones around it collapsed\
  \ immediately.</p> \n    <p>They ran down the street, Blit tugging, half-dragging\
  \ Allyra forward with his artificial speed, when suddenly the ground beneath them\
  \ shook and the air rumbled. Blit turned around. The old townhouse—what had been\
  \ his home for the past several months—collapsed into a gigantic pillar of smoke\
  \ and rubble.</p> \n    <p>He stared, hardly able to breathe. The Puddles was his\
  \ home; it was supposed to be his last home—really, who can't find a niche in the\
  \ City at the Center of the World? Well, Blit couldn't. He was hunted now, dispossessed,\
  \ just like in every other place he'd tried to live.</p> \n    <p>Something tugged\
  \ his arm. It took him some time to realize it was Allyra. \"Look,\" she said.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>He blinked and tried to see past the disaster that was his last chance\
  \ at a normal life. Nothing came out of the rubble, but in the dust he distinctly\
  \ saw the shadow of a half-orc making his way around.</p> \n    <p>\"Right.\" He\
  \ swallowed. Then he took Allyra's hand again and led her at a jog (for him—for\
  \ her it was more like a sprint) to Plashet Alley.</p> \n    <p style=\"text-align:\
  \ center;\">∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n    <p>Blit was completely out of extracts by the time they\
  \ reached Plashet. He untied a string around one of the under-barbs on his leg,\
  \ extracted a small key, and used it to unlock a door slapped together from old\
  \ cargo pallets.</p> \n    <p>Allyra stumbled into the dark room and collapsed on\
  \ the floor. Blit took a little more care to lock the door behind them and cover\
  \ the gaps in it with a darkcloth. Then he fell onto the padding in the corner and\
  \ fell asleep.</p> \n    <p>He woke first and lit a candle for Allyra's sake. The\
  \ hideout was a small stone room, barely big enough for the desk in it and two people\
  \ to stretch out on the floor. He sat down and began replenishing the extracts he'd\
  \ used the night before. He had much to prepare if he was going to leave Absalom\
  \ forever.</p> \n    <p>He didn't know what time it was when Allyra finally stirred.\
  \ \"What is this place?\" she said groggily.</p> \n    <p>\"Backup lab.\"</p> \n\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Gedrak only cares about the bottom line.</i>\n    </div> \n\
  \    <p>Allyra pulled herself up, looking in wonder at the chemicals, flasks, and\
  \ other odd materials collected in various drawers on the desk. Of course, she hadn't\
  \ seen what he'd had in the rowhouse. This was nothing. Still, it felt nice to impress\
  \ her.</p> \n    <p>\"Why do you have a backup lab?\"</p> \n    <p>He snorted. \"\
  You think this is the first time I've been run out of my home? Look at me, Allyra.\
  \ I'm an aberration. A beast.\"</p> \n    <p>\"No, you're not! You're a—\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"What? Human?\" He stared at his hands, his bulging gut. They were pretty\
  \ much the only human parts about him. Then just inches down it all turned to hell.\
  \ \"Not hardly. Not ever. That's why I became an alchemist. I wanted to find something\
  \ that would make me human permanently.\" He poked a vial of greenish fluid, eliciting\
  \ a variety of angry, black swirls. \"I've gotten nowhere. My greatest achievements\
  \ are the disguise you saw me in and this damn mutagen, which does the opposite.\
  \ It makes me more me—hideous and feral. That's the last thing I want.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"You're not the only fiend-blooded man in the world, you know. You're not\
  \ even the only one I've met. It doesn't define you.\" She reached up a hand to\
  \ touch him.</p> \n    <p>Blit batted it away. \"You know why I came to the Puddles?\"\
  \ he barked. \"Why I didn't set up shop in the Coins or the Foreign Quarter like\
  \ a human alchemist? I've lived in a dozen villages. I helped people, you know?\
  \ Love brews, healing potions, whatever they needed, if I knew how to make it.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"But no matter how helpful I was, no matter how long I lived in a place,\
  \ I was never a part of the place. Nobody trusts the hellspawn. Something bad happens—\
  crop fails, some gaffer bites it, a member of the city guard gets killed—guess who\
  \ gets blamed? Doesn't matter that I saved their skins a hundred times, oh no! It's\
  \ a worldview thing, see? Once you dehumanize someone, they become the source of\
  \ every bad thing. Doesn't matter what you do, it's what you are, and eventually\
  \ they always turn on you.\"</p> \n    <p>Allyra had the good sense to turn away\
  \ when he said that. Good. He was afraid he'd been too subtle.</p> \n    <p>\"I'm\
  \ sorry, Blit. I—\"</p> \n    <p>He waved it off. \"Eh. I'm sorry I let my guard\
  \ down. By now you'd think I'd know better than to trust anyone.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  What? But you can... God, for someone so nice, you're pretty self-absorbed, you\
  \ know that? I like you, Blit.\"</p> \n    <p>That stopped him. After a moment,\
  \ he remembered to close his mouth.</p> \n    <p>\"I...\" She tossed her hands into\
  \ the air. \"I was a swamp hag, okay? There's no excuse for how I used you. I mean,\
  \ it was a greater good thing—you were our best source for most of the guilds—but\
  \ that doesn't make it right. I'm truly sorry, and if I ever lie to you again, you\
  \ have my permission to burn down my house after you take whatever looks good to\
  \ you. Can we square that?\"</p> \n    <p>He stared at her for a while, still caught\
  \ on the words \"I like you.\" Nobody had ever said that to him before—not even\
  \ lying. Eventually, he nodded.</p> \n    <p>\"Okay.\" She tucked a lock of hair\
  \ behind one ear. \"Okay. So can I tell you who I am? What I know? Because there\
  \ are some really important things happening—I'm sorry, okay, I know it was your\
  \ home and it was the latest tragedy in a tragic life—but even more important than\
  \ that. People are in danger, and I'm not going back out there to face the bad guys\
  \ unless I trust the person I'm with and he can trust me, okay?\"</p> \n    <p>He\
  \ nodded again, not because he knew what she was talking about, but mostly because\
  \ he wanted the truth and she seemed more than willing to offer it.</p> \n    <p>She\
  \ nodded, staring at a spot on the wall to her right. \"So, we—most of the Puddleglut,\
  \ I mean—aren't just Caydenites. We've been spying on the guilds in the Puddles\
  \ for a long time now, passing our information on to Caydenite cells in the other\
  \ districts so they can stop the worst of the guilds' activities.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  You were kind of my main source of info about the Banshees.\" She finally looked\
  \ him in the eye. She had the good sense to look embarrassed. \"We knew about Gedrak\
  \ and Hollis already, and then I used—\"</p> \n    <p>\"Wait, who?\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Hollis. The guard you found last week. He's a Token Guard from the Coins and a grit\
  \ addict. I used what I knew to fill the gaps in your story, then did a little investigating\
  \ of my own. Apparently, Hollis tried to blackmail Gedrak for some free grit, and\
  \ Gedrak didn't take kindly to that.\"</p> \n    <p>Blit chuckled. He'd guessed\
  \ right about that first meeting after all. \"So what the hell happened last night?\
  \ Gedrak met with someone important, I know that much. Was it about Hollis? The\
  \ Puddleglut?\"</p> \n    <p>Allyra took a deep breath. \"Her name is Talish.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Her tone implied much. The question mark above Gedrak's name came\
  \ to Blit's mind again.</p> \n    <p>\"We didn't know enough about her. We thought\
  \ she was just a middleman for the Banshees' smuggling operations, but apparently\
  \ she's more important than that. I spied on them last night—alone, which I shouldn't\
  \ have been—and heard enough. The watch is putting pressure on her because of the\
  \ missing guard, so she ordered Gedrak to destroy it all, everything that could\
  \ possibly tie their operations to her.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Their loose ends,\" Blit\
  \ said, remembering Gedrak's words.</p> \n    <p>Allyra nodded. \"You. Me. The Puddleglut.\
  \ They're folding up their whole operation, and leaving nothing to chance.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"That's good, though, right? The Banshees are done. No more smuggling.\
  \ You and I just need to get out of Absalom.\"</p> \n    <p>She looked him in the\
  \ eye, a pained expression on her face. \"No, they're destroying everything, Blit.\
  \ Grit, weapons, pesh... even the slaves.\"</p> \n    <p>It bothered Blit that Allyra\
  \ knew more about his employers than he did, but that didn't change anything. \"\
  That's got nothing to do with me.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Slaves, Blit! They're going to\
  \ kill them! Stuff them in a warehouse and burn it down like the Puddleglut. We\
  \ have to do something.\"</p> \n    <p>Blit laughed. \"No, we definitely don't.\
  \ We were nearly killed last night—you twice.\"</p> \n    <p>She sulked at that.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Maybe you need to find out what happened to the other Caydenites, but\
  \ I need to leave Absalom for good before Gedrak and his goons find out where I've\
  \ gone. I can't risk my life for a bunch of slaves.\"</p> \n    <p>\"They're people,\
  \ Blit.\"</p> \n    <p>\"So am I!\"</p> \n    <p>Allyra did the last thing he expected\
  \ then: she slapped him hard in his bony face. It hurt more than he cared to admit.\
  \ \"You just finished telling me how dehumanized you are, how outcast. Well think\
  \ about this, Blit: they can't leave Absalom. They can't just go to another town\
  \ or village and pretend everything's okay. They. Are. Slaves. However hard your\
  \ life has been, you have your freedom. You're still alive.\"</p> \n    <p>Blit\
  \ fell onto his stool (he wasn't sure when he'd stood up), and for a long time,\
  \ neither of them said anything. He looked away and exhaled slowly. \"I'm not saying\
  \ I've got it worse,\" he said finally. \"But we're all in danger here, and I can't...\
  \ I can't help them. I'll be lucky if I can help myself.\"</p> \n    <p>Many minutes\
  \ of silence stood between them. Eventually, Blit turned back to his work, eminently\
  \ conscious of her gaze on his back, her staccato breaths.</p> \n    <p>\"I was\
  \ wrong, Blit,\" she finally said. \"I would've sworn you were good underneath,\
  \ too.\"</p> \n    <p>Blit winced when she slammed the door.</p> \n    <p>He pounded\
  \ a fist into the desk. \"Fine,\" he growled at no one. \"Go and die!\"</p> \n \
  \   <p>At least he would live. And if Allyra didn't, well, that's what she wanted,\
  \ right? A worthy sacrifice for Cayden's glory. Either that or the slaves would\
  \ be free. Everybody got what they wanted.</p> \n    <p>He looked over his makeshift\
  \ lab, at the potions and mutagens he'd spent years perfecting, all in pursuit of\
  \ the discovery that would make him permanently human. Then his personal hell would\
  \ be over. He'd be like everyone else.</p> \n    <p>Except he wouldn't, would he?\
  \ He'd still be Blit, no matter what he did to his body.</p> \n    <p>He dug his\
  \ nails into his palms. Then he pounded the desk again once, twice, thrice. Beakers\
  \ rattled. Jars fell over. He pounded and pounded until finally his hands flew to\
  \ his cloak, tucked a dozen vials into the pockets, and he ran outside shouting,\
  \ \"Allyra! Wait!\"</p> \n    <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Coming Soon:</b>\
