  articlebody\"> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">A dark wind blows through the\
  \ Paizo offices (or at least through mine) on this chilly January afternoon, but\
  \ that wind brings good portents of something very, very evil. Four of our favorite\
  \ Pathfinder iconic heroes are coming to the world of the <em>Kingdom Death: Monster</em>\
  \ nightmare horror miniatures game, so I'm taking the opportunity of today's usually\
  \ minis-filled publisher preview blog to tell you all about it, because honestly,\
  \ I'm super excited about this project!</p> \n     <p><em>Kingdom Death: Monster</em>\
  \ is currently in the final day of its record-shattering <a href=\"http://kck.st/2iO1ZZQ\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Kickstarter campaign</a>, the largest ever for a game—tabletop\
  \ or otherwise—in Kickstarter's history. It's a success the game richly deserves.\
  \ <em>Kingdom Death: Monster</em> is one of the best-looking hobby games I've ever\
  \ played, and one of the most interesting campaign-style minis game I've ever come\
  \ across. The current Kickstarter is for a \"1.5\" update of the original, which\
  \ many of us at Paizo purchased the first time around a few years ago. Many Paizonians\
  \ play after-hour <em>Kingdom Death</em> games here at work, and the game's crazy\
  \ atmospherics and innovative gameplay keep us coming back for more.</p> \n    \

  \      <br> <i>Erik Mona plays a pre-release version of </i>Kingdom Death: Monster<i>\
  \ at Gen Con 2015.</i>\n     </div> \n     <p>For me, the big appeal is the miniatures.\
  \ Simply put, <em>Kingdom Death</em> has some of the most gorgeous miniatures in\
  \ my entire personal collection, featuring jaw-dropping designs. They're also produced\
  \ at a slightly larger scale than, say, <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder\
  \ Battles</a> figures, which allows for easier painting and greater sculpt detail\
  \ without being so large that you can't use them with a 5-foot grid or with other\
  \ 35 mm figures.</p> \n     <p>I've always dreamed of seeing the Pathfinder iconic\
  \ characters as <em>Kingdom Death</em> figures, and I'm happy to say that, thanks\
  \ to the newly announced <a href=\"http://kck.st/2hWleM2\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Pathfinders\
  \ of Death</em> expansion</a>, that dream (nightmare?) is now a reality.</p> \n\
  \     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20170106-Merisiel.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20170106-Merisiel_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p><em>Pathfinders of Death</em> will include official\
  \ <em>Kingdom Death: Monster</em> unpainted figures for Pathfinder iconic characters\
  \ Merisiel, Valeros, Kyra, and Seoni, as well as rules to play them in the game.\
  \ Minis collectors not interested in the full game can pledge at the $5.00 level\
  \ and then add the set as a $60 add-on, but as a player of the game I've got to\
  \ say that would be a mistake. For the first KD Kickstarter I focused on minis over\
  \ the game, and later learned how amazing the gameplay is and I had to purchase\
  \ some of the expansions on the secondary market at inflated prices. Don't overlook\
  \ the game, is what I'm saying.</p> \n     <p>Above we see the <em>Kingdom Death</em>\
  \ version of Merisiel, Pathfinder's iconic rogue. Most <em>Kingdom Death</em> characters\
  \ awaken naked in a shadowy nightmare realm with only a rock as a weapon, but our\
  \ Pathfinder characters appear fully armed and armored, with new rules for more\
  \ heroic characters in a world that usually involves very little hope indeed.</p>\
  \ \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20170106-Valeros.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20170106-Valeros_360.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>Here's an early look at Valeros, who has picked up some characteristically\
  \ <em>Kingdom Death</em> magic items on his journey into nightmare. He is one tough\
  \ customer, and that sword he's got is probably the most metal sword he's ever held\
  \ before. Wow!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/20170106-Kyra.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/20170106-Kyra_360.jpeg\"></a>\n     </div> \n  \
  \   <p>We haven't seen Seoni, yet, but Kyra here just arrived in the Paizo offices\
  \ and sailed through the approval process without a hitch. Those of you familiar\
  \ with the world of <em>Kingdom Death</em> no doubt know that characters in the\
  \ game are often fairly naked, with several optional figures falling into a \"pin-up\"\
  \ category with, let's call it a different approach than the one you're used to\
  \ seeing in Pathfinder. We wanted to make sure that our heroes, while absorbing\
  \ some of the appeal of the KD visual aesthetic, were nonetheless still the Pathfinder\
  \ heroes you know and love. A pinup version of Kyra, for example, was never on the\
  \ table.</p> \n     <p>Let me circle back on that point for just a moment. As a\
  \ note for those not already familiar with the game (and who didn't infer it from\
  \ everything above), <em>Kingdom Death</em> is the reason the phrase \"for mature\
  \ audiences only\" was invented. <em>Kingdom Death</em> explores every form of horror\
  \ you can imagine—and many you hopefully can't imagine—going to extremes we'd never\
  \ explore in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. We want to make it clear that this\
  \ arrangement does not signal some new direction for the Pathfinder RPG or the content\
  \ you'll find in our products. It does, however, signal the chance for you to get\
  \ insanely high-quality miniatures of your favorite Pathfinder characters. So, forewarned,\
  \ make the decisions right for you and your gaming group.</p> \n     <p>For now,\
  \ these figures are available exclusively through the <a href=\"http://kck.st/2iO1ZZQ\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\"><em>Kingdom Death: Monster</em> Kickstarter campaign</a>, which\
  \ ends in less than 24 hours. We may find a way to bring some limited quantity of\
  \ these figures to folks who miss out on the campaign months and months and months\
  \ down the road, but if you want to be absolutely certain to get them, I urge you\
  \ to back the project while you still can. We love these miniatures and the game\
  \ here at Paizo, and hope that you will enjoy these figures as well.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>And that's it for this momentous week. There will be NO Publisher Preview for\
  \ the next two weeks, as I head to Hawaii for a MUCH needed family vacation. When\
  \ I return I will bring an epic feast of <a href=\"/products/btpy9qab\"><em>Crown\
  \ of Fangs</em></a> previews for you to enjoy.</p> \n     <p>Until then, I remain...</p>\
