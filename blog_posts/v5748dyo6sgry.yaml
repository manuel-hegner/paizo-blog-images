  \     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">In the history of Golarion,\
  \ no empire has reached the heights of influence nor seen that influence ripped\
  \ away by revolutionaries and anarchists than Cheliax—at least if modern accounts\
  \ of Chelish history are to be believed. But in today’s Cheliax, ruled by Her Infernal\
  \ Majestrix, Queen Abrogail II of the Thrice-Damned House of Thrune, the truth is\
  \ malleable and is often altered to support the reigning regime rather than objective\
  \ fact. From the outside, Cheliax appears as a failing state, whose territories\
  \ have slipped through its fingers in the wake of decades of tyrannical rule by\
  \ devil-worshipping nobles more concerned with their own power than the plight of\
  \ their people, an empire in decline despite its own claims to the contrary. </p>\

  \      </div> \n      <p>At the heart of the Old Cheliax meta-region is Cheliax\
  \ itself. Two recent revolutions (one successful, the other not so much) within\
  \ their borders have shown the people the precarious position their government and\
  \ aristocracy find themselves in. In response to growing anti-Thrune sentiment,\
  \ the infernal agents of the throne have redoubled their efforts to stamp out any\
  \ discord and promote the propagandic party line of both House Thrune and the church\
  \ of Asmodeus. Despite this, the downtrodden and abused commoners of Cheliax know\
  \ of the success of the Silver Ravens in Ravounel and of the folly of mounting an\
  \ overt assault on House Thrune as the Glorious Reclamation attempted to do, and\
  \ they have adapted. With the help of the Firebrands and allied organizations like\
  \ the Twilight Talons of Andoran and the halfling abolitionists of the Bellflower\
  \ Network, small cells of dissenting Chelish revolutionaries are gaining a foothold\
  \ in the deep shadows. Will the agents of the crown, the Hellknights sworn to maintain\
  \ law and order, and the Asmodean church be enough to put out any new sparks of\
  \ freedom that may take light in the dry kindling of the authoritarian regime?</p>\

  \ </div> \n      <p>The successful revolution that has so effectively inspired the\
  \ people of Cheliax to consider alternatives to the status quo is that of Ravounel.\
  \ Formerly a Chelish archduchy, Ravounel began its struggle for sovereignty in 4716\
  \ AR behind the revolutionaries of Kintargo known as the Silver Ravens. At the same\
  \ time, the Iomedaen crusaders of the Glorious Reclamation attacked Cheliax in Westcrown\
  \ far to the south. Its armies and resources split between the two fronts, Cheliax\
  \ could only win one war, and in 4717 House Thrune was forced to recognize Ravounel’\
  s independence. Today, Ravounel’s focus is on building the foundation of a stable\
  \ government to last for generations to come and establishing trade with its neighbors\
  \ along Avistan and Garund’s western coasts.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ run vertically down each side of this shield and one down the center. A set of\
  \ black and white laurel branches are set at the bottom of the shield and rest of\
  \ each side.  Above the shield is a silver diamond-shaped symbol incorporating wings\
  \ for the three lower points.\"></a> \n       <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Illustration\

  \ shares a border with the shadow-shrouded nation of Nidal—the oldest continuous\
  \ nation state in the entire region. Founded by followers of Zon-Kuthon emboldened\
  \ during the Age of Darkness, the isolationist nation is ruled by a secret cabal\
  \ of shadowcasters known as the Black Triune. During the period of Chelish expansion\
  \ known as the Everwar, Cheliax formally annexed Nidal, though the latter never\
  \ truly ceded its independence to Chelish rule. Instead, the Black Triune maintained\
  \ near total control of the shadowy nation by Chelish grace. Even under control\
  \ of House Thrune, Nidal has been left largely to its own devices, though the common\
  \ ground between Zon-Kuthon’s and Asmodeus’s faiths have strengthened the nations’\
  \ alliance.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190716-shadowflamerift.jpg\"\

  \     </div> \n      <p>In Isger, to Cheliax’s northeast, however, things are not\
  \ so cordial. Isger is a vassal in every form of the word, with its ruler, Hedvend\
  \ VI little more than a thrall under Abrogail’s iron rule. Despite its close ties\
  \ to Cheliax, Isger gets little benefit from its powerful liege state’s influence,\
  \ instead sending its resources to Cheliax with little in return. This dynamic was\
  \ never more evident than two decades ago, when the goblins of Isger’s Chitterwood,\
  \ under hobgoblin commanders, attacked much of the unprotected countryside surrounding\
  \ the forest. During the ensuing Goblinblood Wars, the armies not only of Cheliax\
  \ but Andoran and Druma had to come to the Isgeri’s aid, and casualties were high\
  \ on both sides. Even 20 years on, Isger is still recovering from the bloody conflict,\
  \ but a glimmer of hope has arisen, for among the surviving goblins, a new alliance\
  \ of likeminded tribes has begun reaching out to the local human population in the\
  \ hopes of preventing future conflicts between goblinoids and other ancestries from\
  \ causing the same level of devastation. And with the undead threat around Lake\
  \ Encarthan growing, the Isgeri largely welcome any allies they can get as their\
  \ government largely ignores their needs in order to lick their Chelish masters’\
  \ boots.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190716-chitterwood.jpg\"\

  \ Chelish rebel, Goblinblood orphan, or Thrune loyalist, as well as the Hellknight\
  \ Armiger archetype, which allows members of all classes to begin their journey\
  \ as a keeper of law and order as early as 2nd level! Look for a new piece of horror-tinged\
  \ flash fiction from Liane Merciel later this week as the Tales of Lost Omens series\

  \ the frontier region of Varisia and its larger meta-region of the Saga Lands.</p>\
