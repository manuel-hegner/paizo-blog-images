  \ team recently released a new project in partnership with Paizo: <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02eat?FoundryVTT-Pathfinder-2E-Tokens-Bestiary\"\
  >a comprehensive artwork and token pack</a> that covers every creature in the <em>Pathfinder\
  \ Bestiary</em>, <em>Bestiary 2</em>, and <em>Bestiary 3</em> for Pathfinder Second\
  \ Edition.</p> \n     <p>In the last few days we’ve been overwhelmed by the positive\
  \ response to this release, and we couldn’t be more pleased to see people enjoying\
  \ our hard work. We’ve also been flooded with questions about our process, so we\
  \ thought we’d take this opportunity to pull back the curtain a little bit and share\
  \ something about how this product was made and the team that brought it to life.</p>\

  \ \n     <br> \n     <h3>Nath (Anathema)</h3> \n     <p>For those who don't know\
  \ me, I'm Anathema or Nath—or Shane if we want to use real names—the Project Coordinator\
  \ for Foundry VTT and one of the people responsible for helping to bring premium\
  \ content for Pathfinder to the Foundry VTT community. I'm often joined in matters\
  \ like this by Viviane, who works in content production, most notably on our Pathfinder\
  \ releases. A little later in this article we’ll also hear from Ian, who subcontracted\
  \ with us to actually do the work of converting more than a thousand pieces of artwork\
  \ into the tokens so many of you have purchased and are enjoying.</p> \n     <p>I'd\
  \ like to begin by expressing my gratitude to the Pathfinder community for all the\
  \ support for the Foundry VTT premium content projects. Without the awesome community\
  \ surrounding Pathfinder Second Edition for Foundry VTT, I’m not sure we would be\
  \ nearly as successful as we have been at bringing this content to you! </p> \n\
  \     <p>It probably won't be a surprise for you to read that the \"token pack project\"\
  \ came about as a result of feedback from the community. For months—perhaps even\
  \ years—people had been asking for a token pack for use in their Pathfinder games.\
  \ When we were deciding early on which Paizo projects to offer first, it came up\
  \ then, but for several reasons we didn't want it to be the very first product we\
  \ brought to the community. Tackling the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02eap?Pathfinder-Beginner-Box-Bundle\"\
  >Pathfinder Beginner Box</a> and <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02dso\"\
  >Abomination Vaults Adventure Path</a> made a much bigger splash and, I feel strongly,\
  \ got exactly the right kind of attention. Once we had those successes under our\
  \ belt, producing a token pack was an obvious next step, but with such a rich setting\
  \ as Golarion there are a lot of questions about where to start:</p> \n     <ul>\
  \ \n      <li>What does the community most want to see in a token pack?</li> \n\
  \      <li>Where are the logical boundaries for the creatures and characters the\
  \ token packs should contain?</li> \n      <li>What would provide the best experience\
  \ for users without an unnecessary maintenance burden?</li> \n      <li>Is there\
  \ a way we can provide some benefit to Pathfinder First Edition players and GMs?</li>\
  \ \n      <li>Is there any way to offer token packs that better support Pathfinder\
  \ Society?</li> \n      <li>Should make a token pack per book?</li> \n      <li>Should\
  \ we try to group them based on theme instead?</li> \n      <li>Is there a way we\
  \ can make this beneficial for a wider audience outside of the mainstream Pathfinder\
  \ Second Edition players?</li> \n     </ul> \n     <p>…and so many more.</p> \n\
  \     <p>When it came down to it, the bestiaries were the obvious choice. The community\
  \ has been very vocal about wanting tokens for all the creatures in the bestiaries,\
  \ and it solved a lot of questions about whether we should group by book or not.\
  \ It also provided the best opportunity to provide some support to players and GMs\
  \ who still lean on Pathfinder First Edition, or those participating in Organized\
  \ Play events, as both groups have a lot of overlapping demand for bestiary creatures.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>However, those of you who have been following the content Foundry VTT\
  \ produces will know by now: we don't do things small. As we see it, if we're going\
  \ to tackle creating tokens for the bestiaries, we aren't going to only do one book\
  \ at a time. The project is already going to require a lot of time for organization,\
  \ and if we're going to organize art for 400 creatures, why not make it 1,200? Besides,\
  \ there aren't many cases out there where you can buy more than a thousand tokens\
  \ and portraits to use in your game at a single price point. </p> \n     <p>One\
  \ thing we all agreed on very early was the importance of including a blank copy\
  \ of the token ring, so that players and GMs would be able to have their own tokens\
  \ match the style of the token pack. While Ian will give some tips and tricks on\
  \ getting your tokens to look consistent, for those who really want to understand\
  \ the exact techniques we used: <a href=\"https://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donordrive.team&amp;teamID=60699\"\
  >The Pathfinder Second Edition Volunteer Development Team has been raising money\
  \ for Extra Life</a>. If they raise $10,000 or more (at the time of writing, they\
  \ have already raised a staggering $9,683), I have previously offered to record\
  \ and release a detailed instructional video that will cover every aspect of our\
  \ token production process.</p> \n     <p>Once we knew what the scope of the project\
  \ was going to be (approximately 1,200 creatures’ worth of art, <em><b>twice</b></em>)\
  \ and it was approved by Paizo, Cora began to tackle the monumental effort of organizing\
  \ all the different parts of the project into a sensible and usable state. </p>\

  m Viviane, and I’m a content developer at Foundry VTT as well as a project manager\
  \ for the Pathfinder Token Pack: Bestiaries. I worked extensively on our Abomination\
  \ Vaults and Beginner Box releases, and you might also know me as the community\
  \ manager of the all-volunteer team that develops the Pathfinder Second Edition\
  \ system on Foundry VTT. I’m currently running the Strength of Thousands Adventure\
  \ Path for my own group, who’re just into book 3 of the adventure.</p> \n     <p>One\
  \ of the main things that we committed to very early on was that, in one form or\
  \ another, every single creature should have artwork. At times, that can be trickier\
  \ than it sounds; only a fraction of Paizo’s excellent creature artwork is inside\
  \ the bestiaries themselves. So, when we decided to tackle this project, my first\
  \ job was to create a definitive list of what we had, what we needed, and how we\
  \ were going to fill the gaps.</p> \n     <p>I started by creating a list of every\
  \ single creature that appears in these three publications—not just names, but also\
  \ their ID in the system database, their size, and any other relevant data about\
  \ them that might be needed later down the line. </p> \n     <p>Once I had my shopping\
  \ list in hand, I dug through the bestiaries, the pawn boxes, and the battlecards\
  \ before looking a little further afield. For instance, we found a portrait for\
  \ the kapoacinth (a swimming variant of the gargoyle) in the Blood Lords Adventure\
  \ Path, and our eagle is from the Strange Aeons Adventure Path in Pathfinder First\
  \ Edition. I was very lucky to have Ian’s help here—he has a truly uncanny ability\
  \ to spout off the source book and page number for just about any artwork you can\
  \ think of, like a magician pulling a rabbit out of a hat.</p> \n     <p>In a couple\
  \ of places, we filled our gaps by making minor edits to existing artwork, like\
  \ carefully recoloring the chimera and dracolisk so there would be options for individuals\
  \ of every draconic exemplar. When that wasn’t enough, I ceded the stage to Anathema,\
  \ whose compositing work is what gave us a complete set of petitioners, the living\
  \ graffiti, and plenty of other incredible pieces.</p> \n     <p>The help we got\
  \ from Paizo in this process was, of course, invaluable, and we couldn’t have done\
  \ it without support from them, especially Andrew White and Luis Loza, who helped\
  \ to ensure we had every piece of artwork we needed, and offered advice and input\
  \ when needed to make sure our composites fit with the lore of the Pathfinder universe.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Once we had all of the artwork formatted, renamed, and entered into\
  \ the spreadsheet (and we’d ensured nothing was left out), I passed over my collection\
  \ to Ian for the token creation process and started packaging the module for release.\
  \ That included deciding on a folder structure for our assets, so that it’d be easy\
  \ for people to find the artwork they were looking for. It also meant setting up\
  \ the image mapping functionality, so that all of the artwork would seamlessly be\
  \ inserted into your Foundry compendiums as soon as you enabled the module. As we\
  \ got closer to release, I also took some demo screenshots for the store page, created\
  \ banner images, joined my colleagues on a livestream to talk about the impending\
  \ release, and just generally continued to try to make everything go as smoothly\
  \ as possible. </p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/1605397c-a2fb-4c25-9096-c9989a3c766b/PFFoundry_Tokens_02.png\"\

  \ (SpartanCPA)</h3> \n     <p>Hello everyone! I’m Ian, better known among the Foundry\
  \ VTT community as SpartanCPA. I am one of the two lead data coordinators for the\
  \ volunteer development team for the Pathfinder Second Edition game system, and\
  \ generally speaking, I’m the one “in charge” of the NPC stat blocks. I joined the\
  \ team on a whim a few years ago and decided that a good use of my free time was\
  \ auditing the NPC stat blocks for <em>Bestiary 2</em>, and around a month later,\
  \ the format I had worked out became our go-to format for all of the monsters. As\
  \ far as games I’m currently a part of, I run a homebrew story centered around Alkenstar,\
  \ a conversion of Rise of the Runelords, and I’m playing in a <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02dsn?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-Fists-of-the-Ruby-Phoenix\"\
  >Fists of the Ruby Phoenix</a> campaign. It’s hard to find any free time I <em>don’\
  t</em> devote to Pathfinder these days.</p>\n     <p> </p>\n     <p>I'm very particular\
  \ when it comes to the art that I show my players during a game, which is one of\
  \ the reasons I gravitated to Paizo games in the first place. The first time I opened\
  \ the system on Foundry VTT, I was initially amazed that every single stat block\
  \ is just there to be used—just drag and drop and you are good to go. (Provided\
  \ you had your own art…) My second thought, after seeing the “Mystery Man” picture\
  \ on all of the compendiums was, \"I'm going to have to fix this.\"</p> \n     <p>I\
  \ meticulously sorted artwork from all Paizo sourcebooks I own, for both editions\
  \ of Pathfinder, and tagged each piece with my own naming scheme to easily find\
  \ and create my own tokens to get as much coverage in the compendium as I possibly\
  \ could. Viviane said above that I have an uncanny track of the Paizo art—I can\
  \ definitely say I've put in the time to get there.</p> \n     <p>When I started\
  \ on this project, I was given the raw art files from Nath and Cora, as well as\
  \ a template token ring file chosen by Foundry VTT, and was essentially set free\
  \ to complete the tokens as I saw fit. I was asked to take special advantage of\
  \ some of the features available on Foundry, such as the extended pop-outs where\
  \ possible, and I think they came out extremely well. Some of the tokens I’m especially\
  \ proud of are the elder wyrmwraith, the mist stalker, and the storm giant. These\
  \ tokens show a number of little enhancements we were able to make, such as the\
  \ transparent wing membranes on the wyrmwraith, and the glowing eye in the center\
  \ of the fog of the mist stalker. These little effects aren’t available anywhere\
  \ else besides this token pack, and I believe they really make it stand out. That\
  \ said, while I think I was able to make the tokens pop, I would also like to say\
  \ that the underlying artwork itself was stellar, and I give first kudos to the\
  \ artists who made the originals.</p> \n     <p>The token-making process itself\
  \ was purposely made to be flexible, so that the ring chosen could work with any\
  \ orientation of art or creature body type. (Which is more important than you’d\
  \ expect—we did have 1,200+ tokens to make, after all.) We included the token rings\
  \ in the module as well, so you can make tokens for your player characters, or other\
  \ monsters, in the same style! Quick tip: If there is smoke approaching the edges\
  \ of the token frame, such as with the adamantine golem, or especially the mist\
  \ stalker from before, be very careful to not have a hard line at the token edge.\
  \ It’s generally a good idea to make that token a bit bigger to allow the smoke\
  \ to billow out naturally. There are more tips I could give to <em>really</em> make\
  \ your tokens pop, but if you want all the secrets, you’ll have to take Nath up\
  \ on his offer and push the Extra Life donations past $10,000 raised. It’s a good\
  \ cause, and we are almost there! </p> \n     <p>I’m immensely happy to have had\
  \ a part in this project with Foundry and Paizo. Each company was extremely flexible\
  \ with any requests I had, and I was able to put some of my own touches on some\
  \ of the iconic monsters that many people get to use in their own games going forward.\
  \ </p> \n     <h3>What’s Next?</h3> \n     <p>With the release of <em>Pathfinder\
  \ Token Pack: Bestiaries</em>, we can turn our thoughts to planning the next release\
  \ in this product line. We've been happy to see such a positive outpouring of support\
  \ from the community, and we feel confident we can continue this trend for quite\
  \ some time. Thankfully, we’re at no risk of running out of material to work with!\
  \ Paizo has several decades’ worth of top-quality artwork in their vaults, and we’\
  ve already got some ideas about what to tackle next, as well as plenty of great\
  \ suggestions from the community. Working with Paizo has helped us create a product\
  \ that we’re immensely proud of, and I hope everyone continues to enjoy it the way\
  \ we do.</p> \n     <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold; line-height:\
