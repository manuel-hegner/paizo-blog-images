  \      <p>Hi everyone, I’m Jacob W. Michaels (he/him), one of the writers of PFS\
  \ Year 6’s <em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #</em><em>6-00 Salt of the Ocean</em>,\
  \ which was my first special. This was a pirate adventure, so I looked at classic\
  \ pirate stories for inspiration, including <em>Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse\
  \ of the Black Pearl</em> (but so many others too; more than I can really list).\
  \ I had so much fun trying to bring as many nautical and piratical references to\
  \ the adventure as possible, giving players a great chance for underwater fights\
  \ and thematic sailing moments—I had a blast creating pirate demons and a demonic\
  \ pirate ship. I also loved delving into Pathfinder history, too, since this adventure’\
  s background dated to the earliest days of the Society. I hope everyone got as much\
  \ of a kick out of Averill Quint calling their modern Pathfinders “tomb robbers\
  \ and demon worshippers” because he thinks they’re trying to loot Pathfinder property\
  \ as I did. Lastly, shout out to my co-author, Rigby Bendele. This was my first\
  \ time co-writing a scenario and it was smooth sailing (sorry, couldn’t resist one\
  \ more nautical reference…) working with Rigby and making sure our two halves of\
  \ the adventure meshed.</p>\n      <br>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n   \

  \     <h3><em>PFS2 #6-05: Silver Bark, Golden Blades</em></h3>\n      <p>Hello all,\
  \ my name is Hilary Moon Murphy (aka Hmm)! One of my favorite scenarios to GM was\
  \ <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq021ce?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-106-Lost-on-the-Spirit-Road\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #1-06 Lost on the Spirit Road</em></a>, so of course\
  \ I wanted to create a companion piece for it.</p>\n      <p>My goal was to create\
  \ a truly repeatable adventure: one that would continue to surprise players no matter\
  \ how many times they played it previously. Inspired by two ‘make your own dungeon’\
  \ adventures in PF1, <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy9oik?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-807-From-the-Tome-of-Righteous-Repose\"\

  ><em>Beyond the Halflight Path</em></a>, I decided to have two separate dungeons,\
  \ three possible bosses, and to allow GMs to put their monsters and traps anywhere\
  \ on the map.</p>\n      <p>My favorite part of <em>Silver Bark, Golden Blades</em>\
  \ was including the Risuchō, the adorable network of squirrel-rabbit mail carriers\
  \ that are the primary postal service of the Forest of Spirits. Being able to showcase\
  \ them made me so very happy.</p>\n      <p>If you enjoy my adventures, please look\

  \      <h3><em>PFS2 #6-08: Upon Wheels and Rime</em></h3>\n      <p>Greetings Pathfinders!\
  \ My name is Dave Nelson, a name you've probably seen on several Pathfinder books\
  \ throughout the years, but never on a Society Scenario. That changed last year,\
  \ when I got tasked to write <em>Pathfinder Society Scenario </em><em>#6-08: Upon\
  \ Wheels and Rime</em>. Starting Golarion's journey towards trains (something I've\
  \ wanted the setting to have for a while) was both a big honor and tricky task for\
  \ my first Scenario. However, it seems I did something right, as it is not only\
  \ the most requested adventure of the year but was also nominated for an Ennie.\
  \ I want to thank everyone who played and enjoyed the scenario and look forward\
  \ to seeing how the development of the train progresses (hopefully on chicken legs).\
  \ If you want to keep up with what I'm doing next you can follow me on BlueSky @davicthegrey.bksy.social\

  \      <h3><em>PFS2 #6-09: The Power of Legends</em></h3>\n      <p>Hi folks! I’\
  m Linda Zayas-Palmer (she/her), former development manager for Paizo’s narrative\
  \ team and current full-time freelancer. For Year 6, I wrote <em>Pathfinder Society\
  \ Scenario </em><em>#6-09: The Power of Legends</em>. With the release of <em>War\
  \ of Immortals</em> on the horizon, the org play team tapped me to write an adventure\
  \ to highlight the new mythic rules. I have fond memories of playing around with\
  \ mythic abilities in the Destiny of the Sands series for First Edition Pathfinder\
  \ Society. While Destiny of the Sands features Pathfinder agents in the middle of\
  \ their careers, Power of Legends takes characters who are among the Society’s strongest\
  \ and gives them reality-bending powers to strike down their foes. So naturally,\
  \ the PCs needed some larger-than-life opposition. The main villain’s a doozy, but\
  \ the other encounters the PCs fight all have their own mythic tricks to them too.\
  \ The scenario’s runtime is longer than a typical PFS adventure, so if you’re a\
  \ GM planning to throw this trial at your players, I recommend carving out an extra\
  \ hour or two.</p>\n      <p>You can find me on my Youtube stream Arcane Mark on\
  \ Tuesdays at 8pm Eastern and Saturdays at 1pm Eastern (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@arcanemark2562\"\
  >https://www.youtube.com/@arcanemark2562</a>), and on the Arcane Mark Discord (<a\
  \ href=\"http://tiny.cc/arcanemark\">tiny.cc/arcanemark</a>). My most recently released\
  \ works are the Pathfinder Society<em> Battle of Hellknight Hill</em> special event\
  \ that debuted at GenCon, as well as Roll For Combat’s <em>Battlezoo Bestiary: Elemental\
  \ Storm</em>, which I developed and also wrote for.</p>\n      <br>\n      <h2>Joseph\
  \ Blomquist (he/him)</h2>\n      <h3><em>PFS2 #6-12: The Burning of Greensteeples</em>\
  \ and <em>PFS2 #6-99: Under the Eye of the Mantis</em></h3>\n      <p>Welcome back\
  \ to the fun, friends! You’re just in time for everything to Hells with the coming\
  \ season of aggression—especially from Cheliax. I’ll be your guide for … no wait…\
  \ I wrote stuff!</p>\n      <p>I’m Joseph Blomquist (he/him), and you’ve seen my\
  \ words in the <em>Starfinder Galaxy Guide,</em><em>Mechageddon!,</em> a bunch of\
  \ backmatter in various Pathfinder and Starfinder AP volumes, quite a few PFS and\
  \ SFS adventures, and a slew of other Paizo products and games around the industry.\
  \ This season, I was tapped for two very different Pathfinder Adventures.</p>\n\
  \      <p>The first, #<em>6-12: The Buring of Greensteeples</em> was a return to\
  \ one of my favorite (and most polarizing) adventures, #<em>3-04: The Devil-Wrought\
  \ Disappearance</em>. Shay asked if I would be interested in bookending that exploration\
  \ into Varian Jeggare’s home, and I leapt at the chance. Not only did I get to wrap\
  \ up some hanging storylines I set up in 3-04, but I hinted at another from #<em>4-02\
  \ Return to the Grave</em>, and set up a bit of the overarching theme of Season\
  \ 7!</p>\n      <p>Then came #<em>6-99: Under the Eye of the Mantis.</em> For this\
  \ GenCon special, I was paired with one of my favorite people, Michael Bramnik,\
  \ and found that our styles complement each other perfectly (Good job Devs!). Mike\
  \ and I wanted to give multi-table players some new experiences in PFS specials,\
  \ and I think we did a great job, bringing recent storylines together while bringing\
  \ back classic or forgotten NPCs. It was a ton of fun to work on.</p>\n      <p>You\
  \ can find me at the blog I never update <a href=\"http://www.underwearontheoutside.com/\"\
  >www.UnderwearOnTheOutside.com</a> or as @Doctormono on Bluesky. Stay tuned, I have\
  \ more Paizo work coming this year, and I can’t wait for you to have a chance to\
  \ dive in.</p>\n      <br>\n      <h2>Alison Cybe (they/them)</h2>\n      <h3><em>PFS2\
  \ #6-15: Lost and Forgotten</em></h3>\n      <p>Hi there, I'm Alison Cybe (they/them,\
  \ at least for as long as our benevolent UK government allows me to use such pronouns),\
  \ and I designed <em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #6-15: Lost and Forgotten</em>.</p>\n\
  \      <p>When I designed this adventure I wanted to create a light, puzzle-oriented\
  \ dungeon crawl where the tension wasn’t in whether the party survived, but in how\
  \ they explored. The aim was flexibility—letting tables approach challenges at their\
  \ own pace, try things in any order, and focus on interaction and creativity without\
  \ feeling like they’d “failed” their way out of progress.</p>\n      <p>Some reviewers\
  \ took this to mean “the rolls don’t matter.” In truth, they matter in the same\
  \ way a chess move matters—you can play badly and still finish the game, but your\
  \ choices shape the state of the board. Time pressure, resource attrition, and the\
  \ shifting initiative bonuses in the second act were all designed to be felt cumulatively\
  \ rather than ending the scenario on a single failed check. Pathfinder Society scenarios\
  \ must work for a broad range of tables, so the safety net is intentional—especially\
  \ in puzzle-centric adventures where a single failed roll shouldn’t brick the experience\
  \ for everyone else. Likewise, the “helpful” NPC wasn’t there to take over, but\
  \ to keep momentum at tables where the GM might otherwise have to stall play until\
  \ someone guessed the One True Answer™. I'm truly sorry that people did not enjoy\
  \ this adventure.</p>\n      <p>You can find me on Bluesky and Facebook as Alison\
  \ Cybe, where I post about writing, gaming, and occasionally pictures of my cat\
  \ pretending to solve riddles better than my playtest groups.</p>\n      <br clear=\"\

  \ #6-18: Symposium on a Fallen God</em> It gave me a great chance to play with aspects\
  \ of the Godsrain that I hadn't even thought about, warshards! I felt inspired during\
  \ the writing of this scenario by both academic debates and rap battles. The ability\
  \ to use your knowledge and vocabulary to not only educate, but make fun of your\
  \ opponent in a friendly manner. I was also told I could get to dig into the great\
  \ rules for the exemplar class to make an enemy and I hope people found the encounter\

  \ contributor and proud father of two amazing teens and one orange cat. My most\
  \ recent scenario for Pathfinder Society was #6-19, <em>What Walks Again</em>. What\
  \ a treat to be able to bring back the evil mastermind of a previous Adventure Path,\
  \ long thought dead. I love being able to work with characters and stories that\
  \ have history to work around while developing new bits of lore. Trying to create\
  \ a stat block that was both evocative of the original fiend, and yet made sense\
  \ with the story, was a real challenge. The Paizo freelance community is wonderful,\
  \ though, and I was able to get a seasoned team of scenario authors to playtest\
  \ the final combat. That, plus Shay Snow's development magic, and a storied NPC\
  \ behind the scenes make for a final encounter that I hope will be memorable.</p>\n\
  \      <p>Coming in September, <em>Starfinder Society Scenario #1-06Magic in the\
  \ Mist</em> is my first scenario of Starfinder Second Edition, and I'm really looking\
  \ forward to doing more in the Starfinder Universe in future. You can find me on\
  \ Discord (gm_lamplighter) and at various online conventions throughout the year.</p>\n\
  \      <br>\n      <h2>Hiromi Cota (they/she)</h2>\n      <h3><em>PFS2 Quest #24:\
  \ Tanuki Trouble</em></h3>\n      <p>Hai tai! Greetings, Pathfinders! I had a lot\
  \ of fun crafting <em>Tanuki Trouble</em>, and I hope you had even half as much\
  \ fun playing it! If you haven’t had the chance to play it, <em>Tanuki Trouble</em>\
  \ is a light-hearted adventure designed for players of all ages, with everything\
  \ from a raucous party to an opportunity to play matchmaker to exciting combat.\
  \ As you might expect from the name, it features tanuki, one of Tian Xia’s cutest\
  \ ancestries and one of my favorite creatures from Japanese folklore. Tanuki are\
  \ traditionally very whimsical and fun-loving, which made having Kodomi Village\
  \ embroiled in an out-of-control prank war a natural fit. It also meant that I could\
  \ ask for art of a tanuki holding a pie-launching crossbow, which makes me smile\
  \ every time I see it.</p>\n      <p>In other Pathfinder news, I worked on <em>Pathfinder\
  \ Lost Omens: Draconic Codex</em>, which is due to come out in about a month. I\
  \ can’t wait for GMs to introduce players to my draconic children. If you want to\
  \ find out what I worked on for the book, stay tuned to my BlueSky account @hiromicota.</p>\n\
