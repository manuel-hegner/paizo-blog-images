  \ itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Of the many pleasant\
  \ surprises we at Paizo have run into since Pathfinder's inception, one of the biggest\
  \ remains the popularity of our iconic characters. Perhaps we shouldn't have been\
  \ surprised—after all, when Wayne Reynolds is doing the art, it's hard to not fall\
  \ in love with whoever's getting painted. But when you get right down to it, the\
  \ iconics were created to be tools. (And one might argue that some of them still\
  \ are—we're looking at you, Alain!) The whole reason for their existence was to\
  \ keep us from having to explain to each new artist what made a ranger a ranger\
  \ and a rogue a rogue—we could just hold up Merisiel and say \"draw her.\" But people\
  \ started asking questions about the backstories, and before long we were writing\
  \ Meet the Iconics blogs and seeding little bits of iconic fiction in the hardcover\
  \ chapter introductions. Yet we held off on doing more, always feeling like the\
  \ time wasn't yet right.</p> \n     <p>Then came Pathfinder comics. Before the contract\
  \ with Dynamite even hit the table, we knew that we'd found our chance to bring\
  \ the iconics to life. With Jim Zub as our writer, we knew the iconics were in good\
  \ hands, and it was a thrill to sit back for a change and watch them go.</p> \n\
  \     <p>But we still had far more iconics than just that core team, and after several\
  \ story arcs, we really wanted to tell more tales from the main series characters'\
  \ early lives. So Erik Mona came up with the idea of <a href=\"/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics/pfComicsOrigins\"\
  >Pathfinder Origins</a>, a place for us to explore how our heroes got to be who\
  \ and where they are, as well as introduce some of our other favorite iconics. With\
  \ Jim busy on other projects, it was up to three of us Paizo staffers—Publisher\
  \ Erik Mona, Editor-in-Chief F. Wesley Schneider, and Executive Editor James L.\
  \ Sutter—to chart the course.</p> \n     <p>Since Erik's already spoken at length\
  \ about the first issue, we brought in Wes and James to talk about issues two and\
  \ three, both available now!</p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <div class=\"blurb180\"\

  ></a>\n      </div> \n      <h2><em>Pathfinder Origins #2</em></h2> \n      <p>I\
  \ think it's no secret that getting to write for comics is something of a dream\
  \ come true for all three of us. While we'd all written our share of art orders,\
  \ to be able to see an entire story come to life in the hands of a talented artist\
  \ is a special kind of thrill, and it still hasn't worn off. (As everyone who sits\
  \ near me in the office can attest, I still can't help but crack up every time I\
  \ look at Vint the ratfolk from issue #2.)</p> \n      <p>For me, there was never\
  \ any question of which characters I most wanted to write—a Kyra and Seelah team-up\
  \ was simply too good to pass up, for a number of reasons. It's <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy8oda?Pathfinder-Tales-Deaths-Heretic\"\
  >well</a> <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy94r3?Pathfinder-Tales-The-Redemption-Engine\"\
  >established</a> that I like writing about religion in Pathfinder, and here was\
  \ an opportunity to show interactions between two characters of different good-aligned\
  \ faiths. I wanted to show that paladins don't have to be gruff hard-liners or sticks-in-the-mud,\
  \ and to explore that interplay between righteousness and redemption. And most of\
  \ all, I wanted a cover that was two badass women-of-color warriors in sensible\
  \ armor—which Stjepan Sejic (of Rat Queens, Witchblade, and more) delivered and\
  \ then some.</p> \n      <p>Many thanks to everyone who's already picked up the\
  \ issue (and double thanks to anyone who's reviewed it!). I can't wait to come back\
  \ and show you all issue #4, in which the torturers of Nidal learn why locking up\
  \ Merisiel causes more problems than it solves... </p> \n      <p>James Sutter<br>\
  \ <i>Executive Editor</i></p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <blockquote> \n      <h2><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Origins #3</em></h2> \n      <p>Seoni got short shrift. Being the second character\
  \ to get a <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5la75\">Meet the Iconics</a> blog in Pathfinder's\
  \ earliest days, her write-up lacks much of the in-world detail of those that came\
  \ later. While we got a bit more on Seoni's background in scattered pre-generated\
  \ character write-ups and in the <a href=\"/products/btpy8sdq\"><em>NPC Codex</em></a>,\
  \ details on her remained pretty thin for a long time. That changed a bit with issue\
  \ 5 of <a href=\"/products/btpy921r\"><em>Pathfinder Dark Waters Rising</em></a>.\
  \ In there, Jim Zub presented a grim flashback to Seoni's youth—the manifestation\
  \ of her magic, getting her tattoos, and interactions with other Varisians. It was\
  \ more than we'd seen before, but also raised several even more tantalizing questions.</p>\
  \ \n      <div class=\"blurb180\">\n       <a href=\"/products/btpy9cvj\"><img src=\"\
  //static2.paizo.com/image/product/catalog/DYN/DYN0021-B_180.jpeg\"></a>\n      </div>\
  \ \n      <p>Hazy details weren't the only complexity we had with Seoni, though.\
  \ Over the years, we heavily detailed the Varisian people and their culture—Seoni's\
  \ culture. Gradually, a bit of a gulf formed between Seoni's appearance and what\
  \ we'd defined as the Varisians' traditional look. So what's the deal?</p> \n  \
  \    <p>Then, atop that heap of quandaries, there was the ever-popular question:\
  \ Why's Seoni dress like that?</p> \n      <p>Mysterious history, atypical appearance,\
  \ distinctive dress—oh, and did I mention she's lawful neutral too? Despite being\
  \ one of our most popular iconics, Seoni sure seemed to present more questions than\
  \ answers. So, when the chance to work on the Pathfinder Origins series came up,\
  \ I knew I wanted a crack at figuring some of those mysteries out!</p> \n      <p>As\
  \ a result, <em>Pathfinder Origins #3</em> reveals more about Seoni than we've ever\
  \ seen before. Want to know about her life exploring Varisia? There's a good bit\
  \ of that. Want to know about her family? Turns out Seoni looks a lot like her mom\
  \ and has a little brother. How'd she wind up with her robes? Well, they didn't\
  \ look like that to begin with. What's the real story with her tattoos? That's exactly\
  \ what she's trying to find out.</p> \n      <p>For all the details about Seoni's\
  \ past, though, the real story's about her early days learning what it means to\
  \ be an adventurer and a leader. She's not taking the easy road either, navigating\
  \ the rigid city of Korvosa, dealing with Hellknights, and reawaking ancient Thassilonian\
  \ magic. Fortunately, in the course of things, she learns something her magic's\
  \ really good for and that her strength comes from more than just slinging spells.\
  \ The comic presents the perfect medium not just to show off more of Varisia, but\
  \ also to highlight Seoni's personal brand of explosive problem solving. Overall,\
  \ I think folks are really going to dig learning about one of Pathfinder's most\
  \ dynamic characters, while still wanting to know more about the leader of the iconic\
  \ team.</p> \n      <p>Oh, and my personal favorite iconic, Seltyiel, shows up.\
  \ I figured that if we're showing some skin, we'd better make sure there's something\
  \ for everyone.</p> \n      <p>F. Wesley Scheider<br> <i>Editor-in-Chief</i></p>\
