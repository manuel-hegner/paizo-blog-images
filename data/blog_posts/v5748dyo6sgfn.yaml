  \ \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">This year's been a busy one, particularly with\
  \ all of the work that's gone into creating Pathfinder Playtest scenarios, reviewing\
  \ feedback, discussing the Second Edition organized play program's structure, and\
  \ conveying that in a bunch of really big blogs. While that's been really productive\
  \ from a looking-to-the-future perspective, it's been less fulfilling in the present\
  \ because we had fallen way behind in our <a href=\"/pathfindersociety/rpg/additional\"\
  >Additional Resources</a> and <a href=\"/pathfindersociety/rpg/clarifications\"\
  >Campaign Clarifications</a> process. Over the past 8 weeks, the developers have\
  \ revisited how we approach these books, devised better ways to streamline the whole\
  \ process, and pushed through numerous months' content. You may have seen the Additional\
  \ Resources update two weeks ago, and we're pleased to have another release going\
  \ up later today! With this, we've addressed every book published in 2018 except\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btq01vb0?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Martial-Arts-Handbook\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Player Companion: Martial Arts Handbook</em></a> (it's coming in\
  \ our next update).</p> \n     <p>As the organized play campaigns are community-led\
  \ programs, we appreciate having the input of our community's leaders in evaluating\
  \ which content to include. This wouldn't have been possible without the ongoing\
  \ efforts of our volunteer review teams, led by Venture-Captain Alexander Lenz.\
  \ Helping him in this endeavor are James Anderson, Sasha Lindley Hall, Þórarinn\
  \ Sigurðsson, and many more. These teams of venture-officers read through the Campaign\
  \ Setting, Player Companion, and RPG hardcover books searching for any ambiguities\
  \ and mechanics that could be disruptive in the organized play environment, flagging\
  \ these for the developers to review. It helps us resolve so many more clarifications\
  \ from the start and speeds up the process considerably, and we're very appreciative\
  \ of their work helping keep these documents up to date.</p> \n     <p>As we look\
  \ ahead, we're already working on January's update (<em>Pathfinder Player Companion:\
  \ Wilderness Origins</em>, <em>Pathfinder Player Companion: Martial Arts Handbook</em>,\
  \ and <em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #138: Rise of New Thassilon</em>). Going forward,\
  \ our goal is to update the Additional Resources and Campaign Clarifications documents\
  \ either on the products' street dates or very shortly thereafter.</p> \n     <p>But\
  \ we're not just bringing you more player options; we're also sanctioning more playable\
  \ content. In addition to <a href=\"/products/btpy9op2?Pathfinder-Module-Seers-of-the-Drowned-City\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Module: Seers of the Drowned City</em></a> and <a href=\"/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/warForTheCrown\"\
  >Pathfinder Adventure Path: War for the Crown</a> getting finished up soon (expect\
  \ a blog next month), Thurston Hillman brings three new adventures into Starfinder\
  \ Society to help elevate your PCs to new level heights—while also taking them to\
  \ new, terrifying depths.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"\

  \ \n      <p>We're also proud to announce the sanctioning of the <a href=\"/store/starfinder/adventurePath/signalOfScreams\"\
  >Signal of Screams Adventure Path</a>! While the <a href=\"/products/btq01w1s?Starfinder-Adventure-Path-12-Heart-of-Night\"\
  >third and final adventure</a> of the series will release soon, we wanted to make\
  \ sure that this adventure path got out as quickly as possible to our players. I\
  \ suspect this adventure should see play from our most experienced Starfinders,\
  \ as its higher-level range makes it a perfect opportunity to play through with\
  \ some of your mid- to high-level characters. Unlike our other adventure paths,\
  \ Signal of Screams does not include a repeatable first scenario; this is intentional,\
  \ as the Adventure Path's serious horror themes make it less suitable for repeated\
  \ play. Luckily, you can still use other replay methods (such as a being a member\
  \ of a <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo5ll08?Faction-Focus-Second-Seekers\">certain\
  \ faction</a>) if you really want to experience the \"torment\" over again. Just\
  \ be careful—PCs going through the Signal of Screams Adventure Path are likely to\
  \ come out… changed!</p> \n      <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/paizo-images/image/download/PZO7210-Rules.zip\"\
