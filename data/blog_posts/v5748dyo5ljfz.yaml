  \ itemprop=\"articlebody\"> \n     <p>It's time for another <a href=\"/products/btpy9qib\"\
  >Qadira</a> preview!</p> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Although residents of\
  \ the Inner Sea region often think of Keleshites as a monolithic people, the reality\
  \ is a lot more complex. The Empire of Kelesh has made efforts to encourage a unified\
  \ Keleshite identity, but talking about \"Keleshites\" as if they were a single\
  \ culture (which residents of Avistan, especially, tend to do) is about as accurate\
  \ as talking about \"Avistani\" (which residents of Casmaron, to be fair, also tend\
  \ to do). Just as the Chelaxians tend to have very different cultural practices\
  \ from the Ulfen and Varisian customs and history differ greatly from those of the\
  \ Shoanti, the various cultures that make up the Empire of Kelesh have widely varied\
  \ practices and histories. The average resident of the major cities of Kelesh is\
  \ of mixed heritage, but in less urbanized areas, people still practice traditions\
  \ that date back five millennia or more.</p> \n     <p>Qadirans tend to think of\
  \ themselves as Qadiran first, Keleshite second, and whatever other ethnic identity\
  \ they may claim third, but those histories still shape their identities and practices.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>There are six peoples credited with creating the Empire of Kelesh, corresponding\
  \ to the seven virtues Keleshites believe they exemplify—the seventh is the unified\
  \ Keleshite identity, though rumor has it that there was once a seventh culture\
  \ that has been erased from the historical record.</p> \n     <p><b>Althameri</b>:\
  \ The once-nomadic Althameri tribes founded the Empire, and still form most of its\
  \ noble class and merchant houses. Althameri still hold to their tribal identities,\
  \ and many still live in deep desert holds and practice traditional ways, including\
  \ a unique form of Sarenism. Most of what people outside of Casmaron consider \"\
  Keleshite\" comes from the Althameri culture; even Keleshites with no Althameri\
  \ descent often imitate Althameri dress and practices as a sign of prestige. The\
  \ virtue associated with the Althameri is zeal.</p> \n     <p>Althameri use a first\
  \ name followed by a matronymic indicated with the prefix al-. For example, Yaqib\
  \ al-Marah is Yaqib, son of Marah. They may include a tribal identifier when introducing\
  \ themselves to other Althameri, but most city-dwelling Althameri consider this\
  \ information private. If needed, they may append their city of residence or birth\
  \ to the end of their name distinguish themselves from another individual with the\
  \ same name.</p> \n     <p>Most Keleshites who do not strongly identify with another\
  \ ethnicity follow this naming convention.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb360\">\n\

  ></a>\n      <br> <i>Illustration by Eric Kenji</i>\n     </div> \n     <p><b>Aishmayar</b>:\
  \ The Aishmayar were an ancient, settled culture when the Althameri were still nomads\
  \ eking out bare survival from the harsh deserts. Famed for their pacifism and dedication\
  \ to the arts, they were the first people conquered by the Althameri. Their lack\
  \ of written records has caused them to become an enigmatic founding myth in Kelesh.\
  \ Though only a few noble families can prove Aishmayar descent in contemporary Kelesh,\
  \ it is common for artists, actors, and socialites to claim it to enhance their\
  \ status. The virtue associated with the Aishmayar is grace.</p> \n     <p>The Aishmayar\
  \ generally used a string of names, the first given to them at birth, and another\
  \ two to four earned throughout their lifetime based on achievements or personality\
  \ characteristics, such as Nur-Iqar-Shamah. Particularly desperate celebrities sometimes\
  \ effect an Aishmayar name, but doing so is generally considered gauche in the extreme.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>Khattibi</b>: The Empire of Khattib once occupied a large swath of\
  \ the territory now controlled by Kelesh, especially the jungles and rich farmland\
  \ of Casmaron's southern coast. They are famous for feats of physical engineering\
  \ and their great libraries, but their inability to match their physical infrastructure\
  \ with similarly robust social systems caused them to overextend and become a tempting\
  \ target for Keleshite conquest, especially as they controlled the trade routes\
  \ that brought goods from Vudra and Tian Xia into Casmaron. The vast majority of\
  \ the citizens of Kelesh are primarily of Khattibi descent. The virtue associated\
  \ with the Khattibi is inventiveness.</p> \n     <p>Khattibi names originally put\
  \ an individual's family name first: Sadikci-Darya is Darya of the Sadikci family,\
  \ though in recent centuries it has become more common to reverse the order, e.g.\
  \ Darya Sadikci.</p> \n     <p><b>Mideans</b>: The other great empire absorbed by\
  \ the Keleshites was Midea, which warred with Khattib for most of its existence\
  \ and claimed many of the port cities of Khardaji Bay. The Midean love of efficiency\
  \ and organization inspired an unprecedented financial system that includes some\
  \ of the oldest still-operating banks on Golarion. Mideans are enthusiastic patrons\
  \ of the arts and the oldest families are devoted to civil service. The virtue associated\
  \ with the Mideans is elegance.</p> \n     <p>Mideans tend to use personal names\
  \ followed by a patronymic or family name, such as Mizha ibn Illiar, but as with\
  \ the Khattibi, they increasingly drop the prefix, e.g. Mizha Illiar.</p> \n   \
  \  <p><b>Susianam</b>: Known as the People of the Tides, or Susians in Taldane,\
  \ the Susianam are believed to have begun wandering Casmaron after a disaster destroyed\
  \ their homeland. The clergy of their moon god go veiled and are accompanied by\
  \ tattooed bodyguards. Though they are now a rare minority, the Susianam contributed\
  \ both many of the irrigation systems that allowed Kelesh to bridge the harsh deserts\
  \ between arable areas of Casmaron and founded its navy. The virtue associated with\
  \ the Susianam is adaptability.</p> \n     <p>A Susian generally goes only by a\
  \ first name, though the clergy sometimes bestow epithets upon other members of\
  \ their faith, which become part of their names.</p> \n     <p><b>Tzorehiyi</b>:\
  \ Believed to share ancestral roots with the Althameri and Kara peoples, the Tzorehiyi\
  \ still prefer to live in the steppes and grasslands of Casmaron. Their tribes control\
  \ security for most of the trade routes and provide most of the agricultural labor\
  \ that supports Kelesh's major cities. The virtue associated with the Tzorehiyi\
  \ is honor.</p> \n     <p>The Tzorehiyi tend to use a first name followed by their\
  \ tribe's name, such as Nerzad Batgui.</p> \n     <h2>More Introductory Kelish!</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>Since people seemed to like it last time, here are a few more Kelish\
  \ words—these are terms of endearment and forms of address.</p> \n     <blockquote>\
  \ \n      <h3>Endearments</h3> \n      <p>Little dove (term of affection for children)<br>\
  \ <i>yunifah</i><br> (yoon-ee-FAH)</p> \n      <p>Little falcon (term of affection\
  \ for children, especially mischievous/bold ones)<br> <i>tzaherhyifah</i><br> (tzah-herh-yee-FAH)</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Spice of my life (term of affection)<br> <i>reqethnayyah rukhni</i><br>\
  \ (reh-keth-NAI-yah rukh-NEE)</p> \n      <p>My sun (term of affection, considered\
  \ blasphemous/profane)<br> <i>tzorenellni</i><br> (tzor-eh-NEL-nee)</p> \n     \

  \ official<br> <i>ridathan</i><br> (ree-dah-THAHN)</p> \n      <p>kinsman/kinswoman\
  \ (used not for actual kin, but for fellow Keleshites, fellow tribespeople, etc.\
  \ to emphasize a connection, generally in the presence of people who don't share\
  \ that connection)<br> <i>nithveqalah</i> (neeth-veh-kahl-LAH)</p> \n     </blockquote>\
