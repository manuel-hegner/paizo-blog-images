  \  <p><span itemprop=\"description\">First off, did you know that our first set\
  \ of Pathfinder Battles minis, <a href=\"/products/btpy8mq6?Pathfinder-Battles-Heroes-Monsters\"\
  >Heroes &amp; Monsters</a>, was just nominated as the <a href=\"http://www.enworld.org/forum/news/326444-announcing-2012-gen-con-en-world-rpg-awards-nominees.html\"\
  \ target=\"nofollow\">Best Miniatures Product of the year</a> for this year's Gen\
  \ Con/EN World ENnie Awards? We're enormously proud of such a strong showing with\
  \ our very first set, and given the leaps and bounds of improvement on sculpts,\
  \ painting, and packaging we've experienced since then, I'm very excited to see\
  \ how the <a href=\"/products/btpy8rqs?Pathfinder-Battles-Rise-of-the-Runelords\"\
  >Rise of the Runelords</a> set does at next year's awards!</span></p> \n    <p>But\
  \ in order to complete production on the Rise of the Runelords set, we had to get\
  \ every miniature just right. And there was one little bastard in the set who seemed\
  \ to elude our efforts until—quite literally—the very last few minutes of the pre-production\
  \ process.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PZO1116-ShiningChild.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PZO1116-ShiningChild_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n     <br><i>Illustration by Eric Belisle</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>There\
  \ he is, the final miniature to be revealed in the Rise of the Runelords set. The\
  \ Shining Child. He's a kind of glowy outsider from the edges of the multiverse,\
  \ summoned by the ancient wizards of Thassilon to do their bidding in the era of\
  \ the Runelords' dominion. This creature has been a favorite here in the office\
  \ since we introduced it way back in <a href=\"/products/btpy80hm?Pathfinder-4-Rise-of-the-Runelords-Chapter-4-Fortress-of-the-Stone-Giants\"\
  >Pathfinder Adventure Path #4</a>, and we always knew we wanted to make a miniature\
  \ of it. </p> \n    <p>The creature's first appearance, by artist Jonathan Wayshak,\
  \ was absolutely gorgeous, but also enormously abstract and literally impossible\
  \ to sculpt into a three-dimensional miniature (that's the thing about those light-based\
  \ outsiders, you know). When we included the Shining Child in <a href=\"/products/btpy8hif?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Bestiary-2\"\
  ><i>Bestiary 2</i></a>, we asked artist Eric Belisle to create a more physical version\
  \ of the creature, still infused with eerie light effects and still otherworldly\
  \ and spooky. His image is the one posted above, and it's become the definitive\
  \ \"look\" for the shining children in the meantime.</p> \n    <p>So when we sat\
  \ down to create the list of figures we wanted in the Rise of the Runelords set\
  \ to support the new <a href=\"/products/btpy8tc0?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-Rise-of-the-Runelords-Anniversary-Edition\"\
  >Rise of the Runelords Adventure Path Anniversary Edition</a>, we gleefully added\
  \ the Shining Child to the list. After all, we'd been working with WizKids to add\
  \ several miniatures with clear plastic effects in the set, and since this guy was\
  \ translucent and composed of living light, he would be the perfect candidate!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>It would be easy!</p> \n    <p>I've subsequently learned that nothing\
  \ is truly easy when it comes to making little plastic men, especially when you\
  \ get into weird plastic effects. In the months that followed our decision to include\
  \ the Shining Child in our set, he rapidly became the most difficult figure from\
  \ a production perspective.</p> \n    <p>For starters, the Shining Child is size\
  \ Small, making him a bit more difficult to sculpt than some of the larger figures.\
  \ That turned out to not be such a big problem, as WizKids has great sculptors.\
  \ The initial sculpt, which has since vanished into the dark depths of my email\
  \ in-box, sailed through approvals without a single comment. It looked great.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Then we started trying to figure out how to paint it, and the real trouble\
  \ began. Take another look at that image. The guy's clearly kind of transparent,\
  \ so we figured we'd start with a fully clear plastic base. We needed some purple\
  \ highlights, and some splatters of yellow or gold paint to sell the light effects,\
  \ but that ought to be simple enough, right? Oh yeah, and it had to look like light\
  \ was coming out of the creature's eyes and mouth. No problem, right?</p> \n   \
  \ <p>In an email entitled \"Shining Child, the Bane of My Existence,\" WizKids'\
  \ production manager sent along these three \"options\" from the factory, based\
  \ on our original paint step specifications:</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/RunelordsMinis-badchildren.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/RunelordsMinis-badchildren_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Yeah, not so great. You can see the hint\
  \ of the awesome sculpt in these images, but the clear effect was really making\
  \ it difficult to pick out details. WizKids did their best with an opalescent paint\
  \ effect on the creature's hair, but I knew no one would be happy with this miniature,\
  \ because both the WizKids production team and I weren't happy with the miniature.\
  \ Also, it didn't look enough like the art to really sell it as a Shining Child.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>So we went back to the drawing board, from a color point of view. Taking\
  \ a look at Belisle's original art, we realized that he had done a great job simulating\
  \ a clear figure by starting with a white base. So we sent word to the factory.\
  \ Any chance you can try that?</p> \n    <p>Well, they tried, anyway.</p> \n   \
  \ <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/RunelordsMinis-whitechild.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/RunelordsMinis-whitechild_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>At this point I could see we were headed\
  \ in the right direction, but still a good distance from the finish line. For starters,\
  \ the figure looked like it had been dipped in White Out, and the face had actually\
  \ taken a step backward. I knew this was to be a common miniature in the set, but\
  \ I wanted to make sure it wasn't also hideously ugly, so I sent WizKids back to\
  \ the drawing board. </p> \n    <p>At this point, the WizKids production manager\
  \ got so fed up trying to filter our painting instructions to the factory that he\
  \ sat down with a bunch of \"blank\" figures and simply started painting them himself.\
  \ He rapidly turned around a control figure that came closest to the mark of everything\
  \ we had tried so far when he sent me this picture:</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/RunelordsMinis-finalchild.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/RunelordsMinis-finalchild_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>I thought it looked much better, but needed\
  \ to see it in person. As you've probably noticed comparing our blog photos to the\
  \ final miniatures, sometimes pictures don't really do a figure justice. Sometimes,\
  \ you've just got to hold the figure in your hand to properly judge it. Happily\
  \ (and by a sort of cosmic coincidence), WizKids' production manager happens to\
  \ live about 10 minutes from my apartment, so nearing the last day we could possibly\
  \ fix this without trainwrecking the schedule for the set, he stopped by my place\
  \ for a quick review of his personally finished paint master. </p> \n    <p>I thought\
  \ it looked great in person, and at long last gave him the go-ahead to put the figure\
  \ into production.</p> \n    <p>The end result is a Shining Child that actually\
  \ looks like a Shining Child. A figure that utilizes the clear plastic while still\
  \ possessing depth. It honestly turned out to be one of my favorite figures in the\
  \ entire set.</p> \n    <p>But holy moley, it was a pain in the ass to make, so\
  \ I wanted to save it for last so I could tell you the whole, gory story. </p> \n\
  \    <p>Thanks, Shining Child. You proved that sometimes, it's the best children\
  \ who come in last.</p> \n    <p>Next week, we'll begin our tour of the very next\
  \ Pathfinder Battles set: The Shattered Star!</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona <br> <i>Publisher</i></p>\
