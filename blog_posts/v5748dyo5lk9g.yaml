  \ our <a href=\"http://paizo.com/paizo/blog/tags/adventureCardGameHomebrew\">Pathfinder\
  \ Adventure Card Game homebrew series</a> with a look at True Dragons of Absalom\
  \ by David Jacobson (<a href=\"http://paizo.com/people/TheryonStormrune\">Theryon\
  \ Stormrune</a>) and newly crowned Pathfinder Society ACG Online Play venture-captain\
  \ Tyler Beck (<a href=\"http://paizo.com/people/cartmanbeck\">Cartmanbeck</a>).\
  \ </i></p> \n     <p>At PaizoCon 2016, with help of ACG organized play coordinator\
  \ Tanis O'Connor, we debuted a series of adventures based on the incredibly popular\
  \ <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy8j5w?Pathfinder-Module-We-Be-Goblins\"\
  >We Be Goblins</a> modules that Paizo has been releasing as part of <a href=\"http://www.freerpgday.com/\"\
  >Free RPG Day</a> over the last few years. We had enjoyed playing the RPG versions\
  \ of the scenarios so much, and had fallen in love with the tempestuous goblin characters\
  \ detailed in the modules, so it was natural to try to convert them. We even convinced\
  \ Tanis to create a special boon for the event (one coveted by many an ACG player\
  \ since then). Then, before Gen Con 2016, we were honored to be asked to help adapt\
  \ these into the official Pathfinder Adventure Card Guild <a href=\"http://paizo.com/pathfinder/pathfinderSociety/pfsacg/season2b\"\
  >Season of the Goblins</a>!</p> \n     <p>We were thrilled by how well received\
  \ our goblins content had been, so we decided to set to work on another set of adventures\
  \ for PaizoCon 2017. There were more We Be Goblins modules we could use for inspiration,\
  \ but one of our good friends, Elizabeth Corrigan (<a href=\"http://paizo.com/people/EliandraGiltessan\"\
  >Eliandra Giltessan</a>), has some sort of personal distaste for goblins—crazy,\
  \ right??—so she asked us to consider kobolds instead. Coincidentally, one of our\
  \ all-time favorite Pathfinder Society scenarios features kobolds: Thurston Hillman's\
  \ (in)famous <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9cu6?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-6-99-True-Dragons-of-Absalom\"\
  >True Dragons of Absalom</a>! Anytime Paizo provides pregen characters like the\
  \ ones in that scenario, they beg to be adapted.</p> \n     <p>True Dragons of Absalom\
  \ brings players into the slightly crazed mindset of Absalom's sewer-dwelling kobold\
  \ tribe, the Sewer Dragons. These kobolds are given a field commission by Venture-Captain\
  \ Drandle Dreng himself to serve the Pathfinder Society in tracking down the perpetrators\
  \ of a plot involving the Sewer Dragons' turf and a shadowy group calling themselves\
  \ the Onyx Alliance. Just as exciting as the story, however, is the chance to run\
  \ through an organized play scenario as a kobold, a race not normally legal for\
  \ Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild play… and the pregenerated kobolds that come\
  \ with that scenario do not disappoint.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n\

  \ bard who, rather than buffing her allies, annoys her enemies into submission with\
  \ her high-pitched screeching and drumming.</i>\n     </div> \n     <p>So, we set\
  \ about adapting the pregens for our game. Everyone who's familiar with Pathfinder\
  \ kobolds knows that if there's one thing that kobolds are renowned for, it's their\
  \ traps. They LOVE setting traps. We obviously had to translate this deadly proclivity\
  \ into character powers, so we came up with a brand-new mechanic for trap-setting.</p>\
  \ \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20171116-TrapsettingRules.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n      <br> <i>Traps aren't just for rogues and rangers! Varanog's magic traps\
  \ will make cinders out of the most resilient <s>adventurers</s> …I mean monsters</i>!\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>The nice thing about the trap-setting mechanic is that it\
  \ gives you the chance to get cards out of your hand while setting up for combat\
  \ checks later on. You could even set a trap or two at your current location, then\
  \ move away and let one of your less combat-oriented allies jump over and obliterate\
  \ a monster.</p> \n     <p>Once we adapted all six characters, we had to decide\
  \ on the rest of the storyline. We wanted to have more than a single ACG adventure,\
  \ so we dove into the <a href=\"http://paizo.com/pathfinder/modules\">Pathfinder\
  \ Modules</a> archive and found the perfect solution: We would also adapt <a href=\"\
  http://paizo.com/products/btpy7yqz?GameMastery-Module-D1-Crown-of-the-Kobold-King\"\
  >Crown of the Kobold King</a> and <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy83w1?Pathfinder-Module-D15-Revenge-of-the-Kobold-King\"\
  >Revenge of the Kobold King</a>. This would give us inspiration for tons of excellent\
  \ characters for our special adventure path, including Jeva the werewolf-child;\
  \ the deadly forge-spurned; and Merlokrep, the kobold king himself.</p> \n     <div\

  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>As a bit of a tangent, a lot of the scenarios we were\
  \ putting together were set in the sewers of Absalom. Did you ever realize how difficult\
  \ it is to design an entire adventure based in a sewer system? We had to pull locations\
  \ from several different base sets, as well as create a couple of new sewer locations\
  \ which were reused throughout the entire Adventure Path. We playtested and modified\
  \ these until we were satisfied, and it was a bit tougher than we'd imagined.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>We designed a bunch of dragon-themed boons, and even commissioned art\
  \ for a bunch of them by the gifted and talented Keera McNeill; check out more of\
  \ her work at <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/VividAsLife/\">Vivid As Life Illustrations</a>)!\

  \     <p>We'd like to take a moment at this point to recognize that these cards\

  \ likes hats. When Hats loses one of his hats, he gets mad. He has only a single\
  \ role, the Master Collector, which helps him collect even more hats. I think you\
  \ can see the pattern emerging here. When we sat down to play True Dragons at PaizoCon\
  \ 2017, one of the first things a player asked was \"Is Hats in this?” so we knew\
  \ we'd made a good choice including him as an unlockable character.</p> \n     <p>Speaking\
  \ of PaizoCon, Mike Selinker himself showed up and sat down to play with us, and\
  \ really enjoyed the characters and scenarios. He also pointed out mistakes and\
  \ suggested improvements in the scenarios and cards with such precision and care\
  \ that it would have been impossible not to know that he does this for a living.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>We've really enjoyed designing and running these special adventures\
  \ for PaizoCon, and we're going to continue doing it. For PaizoCon 2018, we've got\
  \ a very <i>piratey</i>, <i>gobliny</i> campaign planned; if you're planning to\
  \ attend, we can't wait to see you there!</p> \n     <p><i>Tyler Beck and David\
