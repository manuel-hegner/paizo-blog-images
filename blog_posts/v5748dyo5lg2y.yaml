  \ Changemakers Using Kingmaker</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Thursday, April 24, 2014</p>\
  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">My\
  \ name is Ben Parkinson and I have been interested in roleplaying for most of my\
  \ life. For the last five years I have been running a project in Uganda, which trains\
  \ indigenous youth in Uganda to become social entrepreneurs, sometimes known as\
  \ change makers. Our project is known as the Butterfly Project because it relies\
  \ on the concept that nurturing youth can transform them into Butterflies, capable\
  \ of changing the community in which they live and we are very proud of the young\
  \ people we have been working with, most of which come from slum areas in Kampala\
  \ and some from remote village areas.</span></p> \n    <p>I originally thought of\
  \ the value of roleplaying when I was in Nigeria. Children there were using their\
  \ own creativity to make games from local materials and I felt strongly that the\
  \ minimal materials needed for roleplaying—just some dice and maybe a pen and paper—\
  could be made available in village areas very easily. Similarly, children in slums\
  \ have very little inspiring to do and I felt that these children I was beginning\
  \ to get to know loved the creativity of monsters and were going to benefit from\
  \ seeing themselves as heroes, when poverty eats away at confidence to be able to\
  \ effect change.</p> \n    <p>I developed a roleplaying group in Uganda in 2010\
  \ with some youth and we started with Keep on the Shadowfell and moved through The\
  \ Trollhaunt Warrens by 2013, after an enforced break in 2012. I am a fan of 4th\
  \ Edition and the brightest kids enjoyed the complexity of the battles, though I\
  \ felt that the game was not achieving my purpose of trying to stimulate creativity,\
  \ teamwork and problem-solving, as the game was orientated more towards combat.\
  \ Also, the issue became worse not better, as the players became more experienced,\
  \ as everything became even more complicated in the same way and played towards\
  \ the combat tactics.</p> \n    <p>I had run Crown of the Kobold King online a few\
  \ years ago and I thought also starting at Level 2 might work better for the group,\
  \ who, other than Joseph and Brian, had never run a roleplaying game before—more\
  \ hit points meant they could make more mistakes! The game was a real hit and the\
  \ kids were every session excited and enthusiastic to be there. The Kobold King\
  \ wiped out the whole group except Lem and Merisiel and so they had to sell most\
  \ of their treasure to pay for the resurrection bills. Then I noticed how involved\
  \ they were with their characters and that they discussed their adventures with\
  \ their friends in between sessions and so momentum was building.</p> \n    <p>The\
  \ group wanted a new adventure, so I looked through the other adventures I owned\
  \ which seemed to be suitable for a new group. We switched to W3 Flight of the Red\
  \ Raven and I asked Joseph whether he would take over being GM. He agreed and ran\
  \ more or less the whole adventure on his own, as he is a very bright kid and will\
  \ be a future star of Uganda, given the chance. Readers should be aware that English\
  \ is the third language for these children, so reading is much more of a chore for\
  \ them. Most of the children living around survive on one meal a day—usually the\
  \ same thing—and so it is not always obvious which sorts of activities they might\
  \ enjoy. With Joseph as GM, I had wondered that maybe the group would lose interest,\
  \ but actually I think interest has grown since Joseph took over—all credit to him—\
  AND he has prompted others to believe that they can GM too.</p> \n    <p>Their enthusiasm\
  \ inspired me to think more broadly and so I wondered whether we could work with\
  \ some of our potential changemakers and social entrepreneurs, seeing whether we\
  \ could run a more challenging thoughtful group, where they were making more human\
  \ decisions, which might help them in their own development as leaders. I owned\
  \ a pdf of Kingmaker and this seemed to be the ideal vehicle for this idea. So,\
  \ I recruited a young leaders group, including Joseph (The GM), Brian, Patrick,\
  \ Barbara, Kenneth and Oswaldo and, to further challenge them, we used some of the\
  \ advanced character classes from Master of the Fallen Fortress. Joseph (14) chose\
  \ the complex Summoner; Brian (13), a great roleplayer, computer trainer and problem-solver,\
  \ chose Imrijka the Inquisitor; Patrick (13) who wants to be an engineer, the Alchemist;\
  \ Barbara (14) who has a project empowering girls against child abuse, wanted Lini\
  \ the Druid; Kenneth, who is the editor of the Acholi Quarter Youth News, chose\
  \ Alhazra the Oracle; and Oswaldo, who is a Ugandan taekwondo champion, Sajjan the\
  \ monk.</p> \n    <p>I didn't want the group to just focus on fighting, as had been\
  \ happening previously, so we started straightaway explaining that they were going\
  \ to be kings and that they had to act like leaders and that some problems would\
  \ be difficult to solve and perhaps not have immediately obvious solutions. They\
  \ were challenged to act as a team when preparing for the bandits right at the start\
  \ and then I gave responsibilities for the mapmaking, the treasure record-keeping,\
  \ the rations and timeframe and, later, the city statistics.</p> \n    <p>They were\
  \ stunned at the Stag Lord's fight that one of the \"bandits\" seemed to be fighting\
  \ on their side and this prompted them to think differently about their adversaries.\
  \ They are looking for allies now, rather than adversaries, when they adventure,\
  \ so that they can improve the quality of their city. Damiel was slain by a wandering\
  \ shambling mound and the party rallied around to see what could be sold to bring\
  \ him back. They are now looking for people who might have sighted trolls, as their\
  \ city unrest plummets. However, the most interesting discussions came from when\
  \ a visitor was undermining them in the city. Should we kill him? Should we discredit\
  \ him? Should we banish him?</p> \n    <p>Last week, Imrijka, using his alignment\
  \ detection ability, noticed a lot of evil women entering the city, so we shall\
  \ see where this leads and whether they see this as a priority, or further exploration...</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Kingmaker has been a backdrop, though, to an explosion in interest in\
  \ roleplaying. We now have six GMs and perhaps 30 young people starting to participate\
  \ in roleplaying here, so we are trying to figure out how to use what resources\
  \ we have to develop an RPG timetable. Brian is also running a group entirely of\
  \ girls and he has taken them through \"The Deadly Mine\" and I hope he will start\
  \ them on Pathfinder Society Organised Play. We use figures from Descent 2, a homemade\
  \ map, and various dice gathered from different places, and we use the computer\
  \ or print out the pdfs when running the adventures.</p> \n    <p>The next project\
  \ will be to take our GMs out into remote Northern Uganda (many are native Acholi\
  \ speakers) and test the reaction from local children to the dice and adventure.\
  \ Our objective will be to assess the sessions as a new and fun mechanism to assess\
  \ which children might be best at making decisions, solving problems and acting\
  \ for the good of all and then bring them onto our changemaker programme and they\
  \ will then be taught how to solve problems in their communities.</p> \n    <p>Lastly,\
  \ culture is very important in Uganda. Recent legislative changes here have demonstrated\
  \ some alternative thinking and we are not about to use roleplaying to suggest or\
  \ impose actions outside of the culture. We plan to continue to vet the adventures\
  \ ahead of them being run too, to ensure that they are suitable for the group we\
  \ are working with. The game is simply a creative stimulus, which teaches children\
  \ what they are good at and enhances their life skills. By teaching young GMs how\
  \ to GM, we hope we are building their confidence, helping their reading and other\
  \ academic studies, helping them to be leaders and also, because a GM's role is\
  \ not to kill the party, to be considerate in making the adventure fun for the players,\
  \ not just for the GM! GMs will even learn problem-solving from their players, who\
  \ also learn from each other and, since poverty is not negatively influencing their\
  \ make believe life, finding solutions to challenges can flourish.</p> \n    <p>The\
