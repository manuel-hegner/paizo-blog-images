  >This past year has been a big wild ride. We launched Starfinder to great success,\
  \ had a busy Gen Con watching the book fly off the shelves, and put out some amazing\
  \ books that aren't set in space. We've even had some changes in our line-up, with\
  \ changing job titles and responsibilities that helped a number of us take a step\
  \ up. 2017 has been full of excitement (and a little chaos, but what creative endeavor\
  \ doesn't have at least a little chaos?). It's been a busy year for everyone here\
  \ at Paizo, and I wanted to give the developers and designers a chance to talk about\
  \ some of the projects they've worked on this year that they've enjoyed working\
  \ on the most. Being a creator can be rough sometimes, and it's important to feel\
  \ pride about the things you've helped make.</p> \n    <p class=\"tiny\">*Any developer\
  \ or designer not included in this blog was far too busy to contribute to this blog\
  \ I sprung on them. Sorry folks!</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><b>Logan Bonner\
  \ (Designer)</b><br> Most of my stuff that came out in 2017 feels like I worked\
  \ on it a million years ago. I had a big hand in the underlying math and class design\
  \ of Starfinder, and it was so much fun going into deep design and play with foundational\
  \ concepts in a way we rarely get to do with the more established Pathfinder. I\
  \ also worked up the monster creation rules, based on work I initially did for <a\
  \ href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Unchained</i>,</a> during the <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ssr?Starfinder-Core-Rulebook\"\
  ><i>Starfinder Core Rulebook</i></a> creation process. Seeing them make their way\
  \ to the public in <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujg?Starfinder-Alien-Archive\"\
  ><i>Alien Archive</i></a> was exciting! And speaking of exciting, the highlight\
  \ of the year was seeing Starfinder fly off the shelves at its Gen Con launch. I\
  \ was there Thursday morning, went on my scheduled break, and when I came back,\
  \ it was gone! Mind-blowing!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"\

  \ 2017 has been a truly exciting year in the game design mines... but as with most\
  \ years, the things I have been working on have yet to even be announced! So, here\
  \ is to 2018 and all of the amazing things I am looking forward to sharing with\
  \ all of you in the coming months!</p> \n     <p><b>John Compton (Organized Play\
  \ Lead Developer)</b><br> Although its copyright date shows 2016, <i><a href=\"\
  http://paizo.com/products/btpy9qcl?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-113-What-Grows-Within\"\
  >Pathfinder Adventure Path #113: What Grows Within</a> </i>ended up hitting shelves\
  \ in 2017, marking not only the first Adventure Path volume of the year but also\
  \ the first one I wrote. It was a great experience and a great opportunity to create\
  \ some really weird characters (including Hoshbagh) and present desperate PCs with\
  \ desperate situations. The process also prepared me for writing the second volume\
  \ of the Starfinder Adventure Path, <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujm?Starfinder-Adventure-Path-Temple-of-the-Twelve\"\
  ><i>Temple of the Twelve</i></a>, which let me draw on my archaeology training to\
  \ invent a host of academics—both qualified and absurd—and a lost culture on a hitherto\
  \ undocumented continent.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"\

  ></a> \n     </div> \n     <p>On the organized play front, I'm proud of helping\
  \ Thurston Hillman get the Starfinder Society program up and running, especially\
  \ in the changes we incorporated into the Guide (like the new approach to boons)\
  \ and the plans we've set in motion for more than a year of great adventures. In\
  \ the meantime, Pathfinder Society's been creating great adventures and accomplishing\
  \ big things. In 2017 we wrapped up the Season 8 plotline, culminating in the excellent\
  \ <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9tl9?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-825-Unleashing-the-Untouchable\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8–25: Unleashing the Untouchable</i></a> that has\
  \ ramifications across the inner planes.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n\
  \      <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/20171221-MaiChun.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/20171221-MaiChun_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n     </div> \n     <p><b>Adam Daigle (Managing Developer)</b><br> I had\
  \ a hand in thirteen books that came out in 2017, by either being the developer\
  \ for the whole book or pitching in on a book with another development lead. (I\
  \ had a lighter hand in a whole bunch more, but those contributions aren't terribly\
  \ noteworthy and are frankly quite boring.) Of all of these, I'd have to say that\
  \ the one thing I'm most proud of is the <a href=\"http://paizo.com/pathfinder/adventurePath/ruinsOfAzlant\"\
  ><i>Ruins of Azlant Adventure Path.</i></a> This was the first Adventure Path where\
  \ I got to fully run the show, so to speak. I got to outline the Adventure Path\
  \ and form the excellent team of writers who brought it to life. Working with all\
  \ of them was a developer's dream, and seeing this Adventure Path go from ideas\
  \ to real books that people are playing and enjoying has been a highlight of my\
  \ work year. I was also happy to get more information about my lil' fear babies,\
  \ the sahkils, in <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9tok?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Book-of-the-Damned\"\
  >Book of the Damned</a>.</p> \n     <p>My favorite personal development over this\
  \ past year has been stepping up to lead the best damn group of developers in the\
  \ business. I can't wait to share some of our efforts in 2018. Onward and upward!</p>\
  \ \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/20171221-PZO90126Foreword.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/20171221-PZO90126Foreword_360.jpeg\"></a> \n   \
  \  </div> \n     <p><b>Thurston Hillman (Starfinder Society Developer)</b><br> As\
  \ many know, this was my first year working for Paizo. I had been freelancing for\
  \ Paizo for a while, but this was the year I took on the Starfinder Society Developer\
  \ position and got to work on helping to build an entirely new Organized Play program\
  \ (alongside Tonya, John, Linda, and several others.) It's hard to pinpoint a single\
  \ \"best moment” in this year, but I think I have to go with Gen Con 2017, where\
  \ we officially launched the <a href=\"http://paizo.com/starfinderSociety\">Starfinder\
  \ Society Roleplaying Guild</a>. Along with getting to see our new game in action,\
  \ it was an incredible experience seeing GMs from across the world coming to help\
  \ run the first games of Starfinder Society. Given how we've just announced several\
  \ (but not all) of our plans for 2018, I suspect next year's PaizoCon, Origins,\
  \ and Gen Con (ok, and SkålCon) will be full of new Starfinder Society stories!</p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>Amanda Hamon Kunz (Development Coordinator)</b><br> Wow, 2017 has\
  \ been busy! I've worked on a whole bunch of products, but I think the highlight\
  \ for me has to be the Starfinder RPG. I really enjoyed working on some of the core\
  \ system design of our new science-fantasy game as a member of the Starfinder design\
  \ team; you'll see my fingerprints all over the <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ssr?Starfinder-Core-Rulebook\"\
  ><i>Starfinder Core Rulebook</i></a>'s tactical rules, equipment, and magic chapters,\
  \ as well as chunks of the character creation and setting chapters and beyond. It's\
  \ very rewarding to see our game's positive reception among fans, and to be involved\
  \ with so many great Paizo team members to help create it and get it out into the\
  \ world. Similarly, writing the third Starfinder Adventure Path volume, <a href=\"\
  http://paizo.com/products/btpy9xa2?Starfinder-Adventure-Path-Splintered-Worlds\"\
  ><i>Splintered Worlds</i></a>, was also a huge highlight of 2017 for me. I had a\
  \ ton of fun creating the creepy atmospheres and plots that pervade that adventure,\
  \ from a Dead Space-inspired cultist base to macabre adventures among the undead\
  \ residents of Eox. I'll avoid spoilers and stop there! Regardless, a lot happened\
  \ in 2017, and it's exciting to think about what 2018 may bring.</p> \n     <div\

  \     </div> \n     <p><b>Jason Keeley (Developer)</b><br> Of course, I am very\
  \ proud about the release of Starfinder, whose popularity has surpassed all of our\
  \ expectations. But while we were putting the finish touches of the <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ssr?Starfinder-Core-Rulebook\"\
  ><i>Starfinder Core Rulebook</i></a>, I was already up to my waist in <a href=\"\
  http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujg?Starfinder-Alien-Archive\"><i>Alien Archive</i></a>,\
  \ corralling most of those weird beasties and fascinating aliens. I couldn't be\
  \ more excited to have worked on a roleplaying game where a party can consist of\
  \ a floating jellyfish being, an albino minotaur, a humongous brain, and a lizard\
  \ person that can shoot blood out of her eye! On a personal note, I am also thrilled\
  \ to have written the articles on Hadregash and Cyth-V'sug that appeared in the\
  \ <a href=\"http://paizo.com/pathfinder/adventurePath/ironfangInvasion\">Ironfang\
  \ Invasion Adventure Path</a>. Two different evil gods, but both so fun to write.\
  \ And one of them let me indulge in writing some very gross stuff. I'll leave it\
  \ to you to figure out which deity is more disgusting: the militaristic barghest\
  \ or the demon lord of fungus and parasites.</p> \n     <p><b>Rob McCreary (Creative\
  \ Director, Starfinder)</b><br> This past year was all about Starfinder for me,\
  \ most notably the <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ssr?Starfinder-Core-Rulebook\"\
  ><i>Starfinder Core Rulebook</i></a>. But I'm especially happy with <i><a href=\"\
  http://paizo.com/products/btpy9tmf?Starfinder-Adventure-Path-Incident-at-Absalom-Station\"\
  >Incident at Absalom Station</a></i>, the adventure I wrote for the <a href=\"http://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventurePath\"\
  ><i>Dead Suns Adventure Path</i></a>. Besides kicking off the Starfinder Adventure\
  \ Path, <i><a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9tmf?Starfinder-Adventure-Path-Incident-at-Absalom-Station\"\
  >Incident at Absalom Station</a></i> was also the very first adventure published\
  \ for Starfinder. The project presented a number of challenges, not the least of\
  \ which was the fact that we didn't have the final Starfinder rules when I started\
  \ writing it! But that didn't stop me, and it did give me the chance to bring one\
  \ particular monster from Pathfinder to Starfinder—the akata, which I've loved ever\
  \ since it first appeared back in <i><a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy85ed?Pathfinder-14-Second-Darkness-Chapter-2-Children-of-the-Void\"\
  >Pathfinder Adventure Path #14: Children of the Void</a></i>. I also had a lot of\
  \ fun designing the PCs' first starship, the Sunrise Maiden, which is the Starfinder\
  \ iconic characters' ship too. I've really enjoyed hearing about people's experiences\
  \ running and playing the adventure on the messageboards, and can't wait to see\
  \ how people respond to the rest of the adventures in the Dead Suns campaign!</p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>Joe Pasini (Developer)</b><br> In the first few months of this year,\
  \ I was a contract editor for Paizo, hustling with a fantastic group of people to\
  \ get Starfinder, a brand new RPG, out the door. Now, as the year comes to a close,\
  \ I'm a developer for that same RPG, and I couldn't be more proud of the collective\
  \ effort (including my small part) that it took to bring this game to the world.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>In the summer and fall, I got to work with Adam Daigle, Crystal Frasier,\
  \ and Amanda Hamon Kunz (listed alphabetically, because I'll always be an editor\
  \ at heart) to put out a couple rad Player Companions (<i><a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujq?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Antiheros-Handbook\"\
  >Antihero's Handbook</a></i> and <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9wzt?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-People-of-the-Wastes\"\
  ><i>People of the Wastes</i></a>) and the back matter of the first volumes of the\
  \ <a href=\"http://paizo.com/pathfinder/adventurePath/warForTheCrown\">War for the\
  \ Crown Adventure Path</a>. Learning at the feet of such titans of the industry\
  \ was enlightening, humbling—and frickin' awesome.</p> \n     <p>Here's to an epic\
  \ 2018!</p> \n     <p><b>Owen K.C. Stephens (Starfinder Design Lead)</b><br> It\
  \ likely comes as no surprise that the thing I am proudest of that I worked on in\
  \ 2017 is Starfinder. My work on the <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ssr?Starfinder-Core-Rulebook\"\
  ><i>Starfinder Core Rulebook</i></a> was mostly done in 2016, though some of that\
  \ work bled into the early weeks of this year, but I'm not even talking about just\
  \ the rulebooks. With Starfinder, I have gotten to be on the ground floor of a new\
  \ RPG line again, and that comes with a lot of work beyond the rulebooks. I have\
  \ enjoyed being part of planning a universe, and expanding it to new places, brainstorming\
  \ new concepts and new adventures, discussing which of the things we don't have\
  \ yet we want (and which we don't), and when and how to present them. I'm part of\
  \ a brilliant team that's setting the tone and course for a brand new venture, and\
  \ I am proud of both the work we've done and what we have in the pipeline.</p> \n\

  \     </div> \n     <p><b>Linda Zayas-Palmer (Developer)</b><br> I'm bad at picking\
  \ favorites, so I won't pick just one. I'm pumped about Season 9 of Pathfinder Society,\
  \ the Year of Factions' Favor, and proud of the work I put into building the overarching\
  \ story. After seeing the reception to several scenarios, especially <i><a href=\"\
  http://paizo.com/products/btpy9tlb?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-902-A-Case-of-Missing-Persons\"\
  >Pathfinder Society Scenario #9-02: A Case of Missing Persons</a></i>, I'm looking\
  \ forward to seeing what people think of the ways these plots in unfold later in\
  \ the season. Another fun project I worked on this year was a pair of flexible <a\
  \ href=\"http://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/acg\">Pathfinder Adventure Card Guild</a>\
  \ adventures, <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9who?Pathfinder-Society-Adventure-Card-Guild-4P1-Murder-in-the-Marketplace\"\
  ><i>#4–P1: Murder in the Marketplace</i></a> and <i><a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9xek?Pathfinder-Society-Adventure-Card-Guild-4P2-Dangerous-Cargo\"\
  >#4–P2: Dangerous Cargo</a></i>. I play the ACG almost every week, and there's something\
  \ amazing about watching my friends have fun with something I wrote. And finally,\
  \ I would be remiss if I didn't mention my first published race: the vine leshy\
  \ from <i><a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Ultimate-Wilderness\"\
  >Ultimate Wilderness</a></i>. More leshys makes for a better game.</p> \n     <p><b>Mark\
  \ Seifter (Designer)</b><br> \"The math is going to be completely different, but\
  \ also it needs to be fully compatible with all the Pathfinder monsters.\" Doing\
  \ both of those things in Starfinder seemed like a tall order, so one of my absolutely\
  \ coolest moments was when I plugged all the required constraints together, working\
  \ alongside Logan, and tweaked all the variables along until finally…it clicked!\
  \ I found an arrangement that would allow the brand new combat math, no longer balanced\
  \ around making attacks at –10 or –15 at higher levels, to mesh directly with numbers\
  \ right out of the table in the back of the <i><a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy8auu?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Bestiary\"\
  >Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Bestiary</a></i>. There was literally a single path\
  \ to victory, a ray of light in the sea of numbers. I was able to lay it out, and\
  \ sure enough, Starfinder characters have math that interacts completely smoothly\
  \ with the numbers on Pathfinder foes, while retaining a combat dynamic all their\
  \ own!</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Adam Daigle<br> <i>Managing Developer</i></p>\
