  \ is live!</a></p> \n     <p>I know that it's hard to believe, but the <em>Pathfinder\
  \ Playtest Rulebook</em> is less than 2 weeks old, and we've already learned so\
  \ much about the game. Feedback for the first part of <em>Doomsday Dawn</em> and\
  \ the three Pathfinder Society adventures is pouring in through our surveys and\
  \ <a href=\"/community/forums/pathfinder/playtest\">the paizo.com forums</a>. While\
  \ there are some interesting early trends in the data that point at a few things\
  \ that are going to need some work, we want to avoid getting into any of the fine\
  \ details until the first part of the playtest is over (in just about 2 weeks).\
  \ Until then, we'd like to talk about a number of other things.</p> \n     <h2>Rules\
  \ Updates</h2> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Starting today, you're going to\
  \ begin seeing some rules updates from the team to clarify or fix issues with the\
  \ current draft of the playtest. Rather than focusing on typos or other small errors,\
  \ we're going to try and keep the updates restricted to things that we think are\
  \ problematic to the gameplay if left as-is. In the coming weeks, you might also\
  \ see us replace entire subsystems of the game, if warranted by playtest feedback.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The updates themselves are broken into two categories. The first is\
  \ critical updates. These are issues that distort the game heavily and should be\
  \ fixed immediately. The second category, just called updates, refers to rules that\
  \ are important enough to warrant a fix, but that have a relatively limited impact\
  \ at the game table. There are plenty of other changes we're noting as well, but\
  \ most of these will have little to no impact on the current state of the game.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>You can find the current updates by going to the downloads section on\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinderplaytest#downloads\">PathfinderPlaytest.com</a>. After you\
  \ download the PDF, you'll get an email notifying you of additional changes whenever\
  \ we post an update!</p> \n     <h2>Playtest Surveys</h2> \n     <p>As mentioned\
  \ above, some of the playtest surveys are now live! If you have completed your playthrough\
  \ of Part 1 of <em>Doomsday Dawn</em> or of any of the three Pathfinder Society\
  \ playtest scenarios, then we have some surveys for you! For those of you who have\
  \ not, I have a couple of reminders.</p> \n     <ul> \n      <li>If you are playing\
  \ <em>Doomsday Dawn</em>, make sure your group has the playtest tracking forms,\
  \ which are located at <a href=\"/pathfinderplaytest\">PathfinderPlaytest.com</a>.\
  \ These will help GMs and players track a few vital statistics during play that\
  \ you might otherwise forget when it comes time to take the surveys.</li> \n   \
  \   <li>The surveys are only for people who have completed Part 1 of <em>Doomsday\
  \ Dawn</em> or one of the three available Pathfinder Society playtest scenarios.\
  \ Each adventure has a survey for Game Masters and a survey for players. <em>Doomsday\
  \ Dawn</em> also has an open response survey, allowing you to give more descriptive\
  \ feedback of your experience.</li> \n      <li>General surveys asking about classes,\
  \ ancestries, and other mechanics will come out next month (giving everyone a chance\
  \ to get in some play time first).</li> \n      <li>The surveys are each a few pages\
  \ long (usually 4 main sections) and most should take you no more than about 10-15\
  \ minutes to complete. Please make sure you go all the way to the end of the survey!</li>\
  \ \n      <li>Here are the links for the surveys:</li> \n     </ul> \n     <blockquote\

  \ Next</h2> \n     <p>For the remainder of the playtest, you can expect to see a\
  \ blog from the design team once per week looking at the playtest, talking about\
  \ where we're at, what we've learned, and where we're going. In addition, you can\
  \ find us livestreaming <em>Doomsday Dawn</em> as we play through the adventure\
  \ in the office with staff. Finally, after each part of the playtest is over, you\
  \ will find us on the Twitch stream talking about what we've learned from the playtest\
  \ and taking questions from the room and from the forums. It's sure to be a lot\
  \ of fun, and you will be able to watch it all live over at <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/officialpaizo\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">twitch.tv/officialpaizo</a>.</p> \n     <p>Until next time,\
  \ keep playing and sending us that feedback. We've only just begun on our journey\
  \ to make a better Pathfinder, and we need your help to see it through! Will you\
  \ join our noble quest?</p> \n     <p>Jason Bulmahn<br> <i>Director of Game Design</i></p>\
  \ \n     <p><i>Join the Pathfinder Playtest designers every Friday throughout the\
  \ playtest on our <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/officialpaizo\" target=\"_blank\"\
  >Twitch Channel</a> to hear all about the process and chat directly with the team.</i></p>\
