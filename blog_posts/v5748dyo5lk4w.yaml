  \ Determined</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Monday, September 18, 2017</p> \n   <div\
  \ itemprop=\"articlebody\"> \n    <p>Starfinder is doing phenomenally well. Player\
  \ feedback has been great, sales have been great... but one thing has not been great.\
  \ </p>\n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Shortly after we began shipping <em>Starfinder\
  \ Core Rulebooks</em> out, our customers started reporting issues with the binding,\
  \ in both the regular and limited editions. Unfortunately, no manufacturing process\
  \ is perfect, so there are always going to be a handful of issues, but by the time\
  \ we came back from Gen Con, we had received more complaints than we would expect\
  \ for a print run this size. We talked to our printer about it, and sent them some\
  \ samples demonstrating the issue. They agreed that there was a problem, and they\
  \ are doing everything they can to help us make it right for anyone who was affected.</p>\
  \ \n    <h3>What's the Problem?</h3> \n    <p>Our hardcovers use a method called\
  \ <i>case binding</i>. First, each group of 16 pages (a <i>signature</i>) is sewn\
  \ together. Next, all of the book's signatures are stacked into a <i>book block</i>,\
  \ and the book block is stitched together. Then, a fabric reinforcement strip called\
  \ a <i>spine lining</i> is adhered to the book block to give it additional stability,\
  \ and the book block is attached to the cover by adhering the book's endpapers to\
  \ it. (Note that the spine lining itself is not glued to the spine of the book.\
  \ This is intentional: it helps the book lie flatter when open.)</p> \n    <p>The\
  \ problem some customers are seeing with their <em>Starfinder Core Rulebooks</em>\
  \ is that the fabric lining strip isn't properly attached to the book block, separating\
  \ after minimal use. This issue is occurring only with a small fraction of <em>Starfinder\
  \ Core Rulebooks</em>, so if you have been using your book and it doesn't currently\
  \ show any sign of the lining strip separating, it probably won't occur with normal\
  \ use.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <img src=\"/image/content/Blog/20170918-Binding.jpg\"\
  > \n     <p>In this photo of a book with a defective binding, the pages of the book\
  \ are not attached to the yellow-and-white fabric lining strip at the bottom.</p>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <h3>How Do I Get My Book Replaced?</h3> \n    <p>If you have a\
  \ <em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em> with a defective binding, don't hesitate to\
  \ have it replaced.</p> \n    <ul>\n     <li>If you bought it from Paizo at Gen\
  \ Con or through paizo.com, please send a picture or two demonstrating the problem\
  \ with your book to <a href=\"mailto:customer.service@paizo.com?Subject=Starfinder-Core-Rulebook-Binding\"\
  >customer.service@paizo.com</a>. (Please be aware that our customer service team\
  \ is currently working through a significant backlog, so it may take several days\
  \ for us to respond.)</li> \n     <li>If you bought it from a store, return it to\
  \ that store by Friday, October 27. You should be able to get an exchange from them\
  \ or reserve a replacement if the retailer is out of stock. They will in turn receive\
  \ an exchange or credit from the distributor they bought it from, and the distributor\
  \ will do the same with us. (We have already contacted our distributors regarding\
  \ this issue, so your store should be able to work with them to address this issue.)\
  \ If your store remains unable or unwilling to help you let us know at <a href=\"\
  mailto:customer.service@paizo.com?Subject=Starfinder-Core-Rulebook-Binding\">customer.service@paizo.com</a>;\
  \ include the store's name and location so we can work with our distributors to\
  \ ensure everyone is on the same page.</li>\n    </ul> \n    <h3>When Will My Book\
  \ Be Replaced?</h3> \n    <ul>\n     <li>If you bought the regular edition from\
  \ paizo.com, we will send out your replacement as quickly as possible, likely within\
  \ 1 to 6 business days of responding to your email.</li> \n     <li>If you bought\
  \ the regular edition from a store, they may be able to replace it for you immediately.\
  \ However, the <em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em> is sold out in many places, and\
  \ we don't expect the reprint to reach stores until the second half of November;\
  \ if your store is sold out, you may need to wait until then. Check with them to\
  \ be sure.</li> \n     <li>If you bought the limited edition from paizo.com or at\
  \ Gen Con, we currently don't have replacement stock. Our printer is going to ship\
  \ us replacement copies of the limited edition along with the regular edition reprint,\
  \ which we currently estimate will reach our warehouse in the first half of November.</li>\n\
  \    </ul> \n    <h3>Should I Wait for the Reprint to Arrive?</h3> \n    <p>There's\
  \ no need to wait for the reprint before requesting to have your book replaced.\
  \ We are checking the books we're sending out, and you should be able to check any\
  \ replacement your retailer has. And in the case of the limited edition, though\
  \ we won't be able to ship your replacement right away, we can put the order into\
  \ the system at any time so it will be ready to go when stock arrives. (The reprint\
  \ will not have any changes apart from than the words \"Second Printing\" on the\
  \ masthead page—it should otherwise be identical to a properly bound first-printing\
  \ copy in every way.)</p> \n    <p>Paizo and our printer have high standards for\
  \ quality, and we are very sorry for this inconvenience. We will do what we can\
  \ to make getting replacements a quick and easy process.</p> \n    <p>—The Paizo\
