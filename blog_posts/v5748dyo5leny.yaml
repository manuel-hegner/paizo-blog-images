  \ \n    <p>This week I’d like to put the spotlight on four Small figures from the\
  \ set, each of which packs a punch considerably tougher than their statures might\
  \ otherwise suggest.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/SkullAndShackles-Bloodbug.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/SkullAndShackles-Bloodbug_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Up first we’ve got a nasty winged pest\
  \ we like to call the Bloodbug. The southern seacoasts of Golarion swarm with these\
  \ guys, who have appeared in many of our adventures since the very beginning. I’\
  m thrilled to finally have this figure available through our Pathfinder Battles\
  \ line, as it’s one fans have been demanding for some time. And I must say, getting\
  \ the size correct was a real chore that involved three different sculpts before\
  \ we got it perfect. I think you’ll love him (and, predictably, your players will\
  \ probably HATE him). Of course, you’ll need a lot of them, so we’ve slated the\
  \ Bloodbug at the common rarity.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a\
  \ href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/SkullAndShackles-VineChoker.jpg\"><img\
  \ src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/SkullAndShackles-VineChoker_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Bloodbugs also swarm in the jungles of\
  \ Garund, where they are far from the greatest of an adventurer’s worries. Bugs\
  \ are one thing, but you’ve got to look out for an environment where even the plants\
  \ try to kill you. Such is the case with this fine fellow, the Vine Choker. He’\
  s not actually a plant, but Vine Chokers have adapted natural camouflage that helps\
  \ them blend into their environments, making it easier for them to sneak up on you\
  \ and wring your neck. Because these guys often attack in groups, we’ve slated this\
  \ figure at the common rarity.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderBattles/SkullAndShackles-Rosie.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/SkullAndShackles-Rosie_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Since we started the Pathfinder Battles\
  \ line, folks have been asking for more halfling miniatures, and I’m pleased to\
  \ report that this set has two of them. The first is the ever-charming Rosie Cusswell,\
  \ a fellow crewmate press-ganged into the same crew that the PCs find themselves\
  \ on as the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/skullAndShackles\">Skull &amp; Shackles</a>\
  \ campaign begins. With her fiddle in hand, Rosie doubles as a great player character\
  \ figure for a female halfling bard. She is slated at the rare rarity.</p> \n  \
  \  <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/SkullAndShackles-Eel.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/SkullAndShackles-Eel_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Not all halflings are so much fun as good old Rosie.\
  \ Here we have a slippery little miscreant known as the Eel, a male halfling alchemist\
  \ with a penchant for chucking bombs. I don’t want to give away how and when this\
  \ character appears in the campaign, but rest assured, he arrives with a bang. The\
  \ Eel also doubles as a great PC figure for a male halfling alchemist, and is slated\
  \ at the rare rarity.</p> \n    <p>And that’s it for this week. There are still\
  \ a ton of awesome figures just over the horizon, so until next week, man the crow’\
  s nest and keep your eyes peeled. There’s pirates in these shark-infested waters!</p>\
