  >Darvus reached out to bat the rifle bore away and had his palm blown through for\
  \ his trouble. He screamed at the spurt of blood.</span></p> \n    <p>She dropped\
  \ the rifle even as her other hand closed on the butt of her pistol. All evening\
  \ she'd debated how to play this out once she had the Andorens and her quarry in\
  \ the same place. \"Surrender or die, Chelaxians!\" she cried.</p> \n    <p>As hoped,\
  \ the words gave her startled and horrified allies pause. Perhaps it would also\
  \ convince Dronsbech that the little force was united. </p> \n    <p>Dronsbech lashed\
  \ out with his cane, discharging a blast of lightning that sent Lisette flying toward\
  \ the window. She crumpled beside a mystified Karag, her gun tumbling toward the\
  \ corner.</p> \n    <p>Vech shouted something about halting in the name of Andoran\
  \ as she threw herself to her feet, ignoring the tingling in her extremities.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Lisette pulled at the second pistol even as Karag swiped at the nobleman\
  \ with his axe. At least the dwarf didn't doubt her. Dronsbech dodged, and Darvus\
  \ the supposed servant extended his crippled hand, fingers flicking in an arcane\
  \ gesture. Lisette wasn't sure about the nature of the spell, but it set the poor\
  \ dwarf twisting with a grimace. Dronsbech himself dropped behind Darvus, so Lisette\
  \ shot the sorcerer. This time the bullet caught him in the chest, and he stayed\
  \ down.</p> \n    <p>Vech again shouted for everyone to put down their weapons.\
  \ Lisette was running out of time. If Dronsbech kept his cool, he could talk his\
  \ way free, and she'd be hard pressed to escape a hanging.</p> \n    <p>He didn't,\
  \ though. As the aristocrat shot to his feet, his features rippled like flowing\
  \ water, his form broadening. In place of the kneeling nobleman sat a powerful hellspawn\
  \ with red-gold skin and immense forward-pointing horns. His lower half was virtually\
  \ identical to his assumed shape, yet his upper body was so layered in muscle that\
  \ he had burst the seams of his shirt and coat. The hair that crowned his high forehead\
  \ now seemed more like a furred spearhead. </p> \n    <p>She ripped her sword free\
  \ of its sheath.</p> \n    <p>The young guard, Culcumber, extended a shaking sword\
  \ toward the Chelaxian; Dronsbech batted him into the book case with a contemptuous\
  \ laugh, then lashed out again with the cane, now resembling a tiny stick in his\
  \ oversized hand. Another lightning blast hurled the charging Vech over the back\
  \ of the desk.</p> \n    <p>Lisette's eyes flicked to her pistol, which had slid\
  \ to the corner beside the window. Karag still lay on the floor, Kerrigan's rifle\
  \ strapped to his back. There'd be no help from that quarter. Culcumber and Vech\
  \ were both down and groaning. </p> \n    <p>Dronsbech—or, as she knew him, Kryllic—\
  spoke in a low, dangerous rumble as he stalked toward her, teeth bared in a jaw\
  \ open impossibly far. \"How did you find me?\"</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Kryllic_500.jpeg\"><img\
  \ src=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Kryllic_360.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\
  \     <br>No wonder Kryllic relies on magical disguises.\n    </div> \n    <p>\"\
  I followed the stench.\" She drew her sword, backing toward the pistol. Out of the\
  \ corner of her eye, she saw the dwarf shaking his tousled mane of hair. She needed\
  \ to buy time. \"There's more after me, you know. I told the whole guard force.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"You lie.\"</p> \n    <p>\"You can't tell, can you? Go ahead—try\
  \ to read my mind. Darvus couldn't, either.\"</p> \n    <p>\"You've ruined years\
  \ of work.\" Kryllic raised the cane, then turned his head at the sound of a noise\
  \ behind him.</p> \n    <p>The dwarf had leveled the rifle. His shot burned past\
  \ Kryllic's face and shattered the window. Lisette threw herself at the pistol,\
  \ rolled to her knee, and fired.</p> \n    <p>Kryllic, stomping toward the dwarf,\
  \ cried out in agony as the bullet, both holy and silver, took him in the back of\
  \ the skull. He weaved drunkenly, then suddenly found himself impaled on the end\
  \ of Culcumber's sword tip.</p> \n    <p>With that, he dropped, bleeding all over\
  \ his lovely carpet. Culcumber, face stricken, stabbed his motionless body again\
  \ and again.</p> \n    <p>\"I think he's dead,\" Lisette pointed out.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>Panting, the boy relented, his eyes round as saucers.</p> \n    <p>From outside\
  \ she could hear screams, but all the footsteps sounded as though they were running\
  \ away.</p> \n    <p>\"Sorry I missed,\" Karag said. </p> \n    <p>Lisette shrugged.\
  \ \"You did fine.\"</p> \n    <p>Vech climbed to his feet from behind the desk,\
  \ adjusted his uniform coat. His lips twitched in fury, setting his mustaches wobbling.\
  \ \"Would you mind telling me what just happened? What about your bowman?\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>She frowned at the mention of her adversary, but kept her temper under\
  \ control as she ticked off the salient points. \"I misled you about the bowman\
  \ so Kyrllic and Darvus wouldn't read your minds and be alarmed.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  You lied to us?\" the lieutenant rumbled.</p> \n    <p>\"I just killed two agents\
  \ of Cheliax,\" Lisette said calmly. She had begun, almost without thinking, to\
  \ clean and prime her pistol. \"You should be thanking me.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Wait,\"\
  \ Karag said. \"You planned all this?\"</p> \n    <p>\"I improvised some of it,\"\
  \ Lisette admitted.</p> \n    <p>\"So all that about the bowman,\" Culcumber prompted.\
  \ \"That was a lie too?\"</p> \n    <p>\"No,\" she said tightly. \"The bowman is\
  \ after him.\"</p> \n    <p>\"So there's no bounty on the bowman?\" the dwarf asked\
  \ angrily.</p> \n    <p>\"There's a bigger bounty on Dronsbech. You'll be snagging\
  \ four hundred sails for him, Karag. Maybe I'll throw in ten for the boy, too, since\
  \ he delivered the death thrust. Several times.\"</p> \n    <p>Culcumber was still\
  \ too glassy-eyed to respond to the jibe.</p> \n    <p>\"I still don't follow all\
  \ of this,\" Vech said. \"If Dronsbech—\"</p> \n    <p>\"Kryllic,\" Lisette corrected.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Whatever his name was,\" Vech said testily, \"could read minds, why\
  \ couldn't he read yours?\"</p> \n    <p>\"I planned ahead and brought a charm to\
  \ protect me. But he or Darvus could have read your mind like a book. Darvus tried\
  \ to do it when you came in earlier. Didn't you notice the way he was looking at\
  \ all of you? They were cautious, but not suspicious, because they could tell all\
  \ three of you believed my tale. If I'd told you the truth—\"</p> \n    <p>\"But\
  \ someone really was firing arrows earlier this evening,\" Vech protested.</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"Yes,\" Lisette said. How thick was he? \"The bowman.\" </p> \n    <p>The\
  \ lieutenant's expression cleared. \"So you were using us to help you get this bounty\
  \ before the bowman could get Dronsbech himself!\"</p> \n    <p>There came the sound\
  \ of pounding feet, and then the shouting escalated as the door was pushed open.\
  \ The guards who'd scattered to the perimeter thundered into the room. If not for\
  \ Vech's uniform and the strange corpse, things might have gotten deadly, fast.\
  \ </p> \n    <p>Matters really weren't settled until late into the night, and even\
  \ then it seemed like almost half the city guard was there interviewing the staff,\
  \ the guests, and the hired guards, none of whom admitted any knowledge about Kryllic's\
  \ true nature or motives.</p> \n    <p>She and Karag waited to the side through\
  \ it all. She tried not to think about the bowman. There'd been a chance, of course,\
  \ that she'd catch him making a play at the same time. Finally, though, she'd been\
  \ lucky. At that thought, her lips twisted into a bitter smile.</p> \n    <p>Karag\
  \ had been silent for a very long time, and his gruff question startled her. \"\
  You think maybe you could teach me how to shoot?\"</p> \n    <p>She considered the\
  \ dwarf. \"First I have to teach you how to load.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Okay, then.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>This was a little unexpected. Her smile grew more genuine. \"I tell\
  \ you what: I could use someone to ready the weapons. If you can load and prime\
  \ fast, I can keep up a good steady stream of fire. Let's try it out for a week\
  \ and see how quick you are.\"</p> \n    <p>Karag nodded once. \"Sounds fair.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>She grew conscious of the toll of a distant, lonely bell. \"The bowman's\
  \ my next target,\" she said. \"I could use backup. It's a decent bounty. Not as\
  \ good as Kryllic's, but decent.\"</p> \n    <p>\"So all that about revenge—you\
  \ were just making all that up.\" He shook his head. \"You're a cold one, alright.\
  \ I thought this whole thing was a matter of vengeance, when really it was all about\
  \ the money.\"</p> \n    <p>\"It's always about the money,\" she lied. </p> \n \
