  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">by Evey Brett</p> \n   <h2>Chapter Two: The Pirate Den</h2>\
  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">At sunset,\
  \ Anandi returned to the captain's villa where a few silver coins to the doorkeeper\
  \ saw him inside. The party had already begun, made lively by the musicians and\
  \ acrobats in the ballroom. The human man seated in the chair covered in velvet\
  \ and gold filigree was obviously the captain. A thick brown beard trailed down\
  \ his chest, resting lightly on the blue brocade coat studded with golden buttons\
  \ and trim. The jeweled goblet in his hand was already filled with wine and a servant\
  \ stood by with a bottle at the ready.</p> \n    <p>A line of admirers had formed\
  \ to vie for his attention. Anandi sighed. It was going to be a long night before\
  \ he had a chance to get near enough to introduce himself, let alone arrange for\
  \ a meeting. Annoyed, he scanned the room, looking for an alternative opportunity.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Ravi was easy to spot, and he wasn't the only prostitute working the\
  \ room. At least a dozen women were there in tight, low-cut dresses. Two other pretty\
  \ young men flirted with one guest after another.</p> \n    <p>Yet Ravi was different.\
  \ He clung to the men, letting them pour wine down his throat in exchange for a\
  \ kiss. Twice, one of the men drew him off into a secluded corner from which they\
  \ emerged flushed and disheveled. The drunker Ravi got, the worse the men treated\
  \ him.</p> \n    <p>I'd never let my students be so ill-used. Never.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Enjoying yourself?\"</p> \n    <p>Anandi turned, surprised to see the captain at\
  \ his side. \"Yes, sir. I am. I appreciate your generosity.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Good.\"\
  \ He sipped his wine. \"I've been told you wanted to speak with me.\"</p> \n   \
  \ <p>\"On behalf of a friend, yes. I'm told you're the man to see if I want a good\
  \ selection of magical items.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Aye, that's true.\" He eyed Anandi.\
  \ \"Why don't you come back tomorrow afternoon and we'll have a bit of a chat about\
  \ just what you're looking for?\"</p> \n    <p>\"I will. Thank you.\"</p> \n   \
  \ <p>Laughter came from the corner, where a shirtless Ravi was on his hands and\
  \ knees lapping up a puddle of spilled wine. Anandi's stomach curdled, but the captain\
  \ laughed. \"Fine boy, isn't he? My favorite.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Indeed,\" Anandi\
  \ said, and excused himself before his anger caused him to say something he'd regret.</p>\
  \ \n    <p style=\"text-align: center;\">∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n    <p>Anandi took a room at\
  \ the dilapidated museum that had been refitted to serve as an inn, paying extra\
  \ to have the space to himself. He barred the door and kept a knife under his pillow,\
  \ trusting neither the proprietor nor his customers. The wine and delicacies from\
  \ the party rested sourly in his stomach. </p> \n    <p>The image of Ravi, kneeling\
  \ on the floor and grinning like a dog, wouldn't leave his head. The young man was\
  \ starved for affection, as many addicts were. Anandi had seen enough of them to\
  \ know the pain they were desperate to cover up, but he'd never had much luck finding\
  \ a way to help them.</p> \n    <p>Better he stays here, where he belongs.</p> \n\
  \    <p>The echoes of drunken carousing meant a fitful sleep punctured by images\
  \ of Ravi dying, wasting away in pesh-induced dreams, knifed, or meeting some other\
  \ equally brutal end. He couldn't see any better options at the Conservatory; Ravi\
  \ was ignorant, unkempt, and far too wild to fit in.</p> \n    <p>It doesn't matter.\
  \ I just need him for information. A courtesan doesn't love anyone, especially another\
  \ courtesan. The love he held in reserve for Asa had hardened him to anyone else's\
  \ attentions, anyway.</p> \n    <p>By the time Anandi staggered out of bed in the\
  \ late morning, he'd firmly convinced himself that it was absolutely impossible\
  \ to take Ravi back to the Conservatory.</p> \n    <p>No matter how much he wanted\
  \ to.</p> \n    <p style=\"text-align: center;\">∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Ravi lives his life in the moment.</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>\
  \ \"Back for more?\" the pirate asked as Anandi approached the villa. </p> \n  \
  \  <p>\"Captain asked to meet with me this afternoon,\" Anandi replied. </p> \n\
  \    <p>\"Cap's busy for a bit. He said to tell you to wait.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Ravi\
  \ around, then?\" He scanned the villa and grounds, but Ravi was nowhere in sight.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Boy's... indisposed.\"</p> \n    <p>From the derisive way the woman\
  \ spoke, he guessed Ravi was either high or sleeping off wine sickness. He wasn't\
  \ surprised after everything that had happened the night before, but he was concerned.\
  \ \"Perhaps I could take a look at him. I've a knack for healing.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Ain't a good idea, fancy man. Best to leave him be. There're a few other boys hereabouts.\
  \ Might be one of them could do you just as well.\"</p> \n    <p>Anandi slipped\
  \ off the ruby-and-gold ring one of his patrons had given him for protection. \"\
  I'm afraid Ravi's quite captured my interest. I'd like to see him.\" He held out\
  \ the ring.</p> \n    <p>The pirate fitted it to her finger then admired the way\
  \ it glinted in the sunlight. \"He's in the little room next to the captain's, which\
  \ is the one with that balcony. Cap lets Ravi sleep it off there, sometimes.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p> Anandi hurried inside, ignoring the catcalls and snide comments from\
  \ the crew scattered throughout the interior. He found the room easily enough, but\
  \ just as he'd feared, it reeked with sickness. Neither was it particularly habitable.\
  \ The crumbling plaster walls were speckled with mold, and the only furniture was\
  \ a rotting bed, a three-legged night table propped against the wall and a splintering\
  \ chair. The occasional squeak and rustle of tiny clawed feet hinted at other occupants\
  \ that, to Anandi's relief, stayed out of sight.</p> \n    <p>Ravi was splayed on\
  \ the bed, pale and unconscious. The worn blanket barely covered his nakedness,\
  \ leaving numerous welts and bruises visible. Anandi laid a hand against his forehead\
  \ and frowned at the heat emanating from the young half-elf's body. </p> \n    <p>Ravi\
  \ opened his eyes at the touch. \"I need some pesh. I need...\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  You need something to settle your stomach.\" He opened the door and peered about.\
  \ Finding a halfling dressed as a servant, he tossed her a coin and she ran off\
  \ to fetch some hot water and broth. When she brought them, he dug through his pockets\
  \ for one of his packets of herbs and dropped them in the mug of hot water. \"Drink\
  \ this.\"</p> \n    <p>Ravi wrinkled his nose. \"It smells vile.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  So do you. Drink it anyway.\" Anandi helped Ravi sit up enough to swallow the contents\
  \ a few sips at a time. </p> \n    <p>When Ravi lay back down, he said, \"Hey. There's\
  \ only one of you now.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Good.\"</p> \n    <p>\"You going to pay\
  \ me for my time?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Shut up and eat.\"</p> \n    <p>Ravi gave him\
  \ a pout, but he let Anandi spoon-feed him the broth. \"Why you being so nice?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"You aren't used to it, are you?\" Inwardly, he was glad. It would\
  \ make his job that much easier.</p> \n    <p>\"That ain't true. I got a nice room\
  \ and all sorts of pretties from my friends.\"</p> \n    <p>\"But I'm not asking\
  \ for anything in return.\"</p> \n    <p>Ravi was silent as he finished the rest\
  \ of the broth. \"You're an odd one, fancy man.\" </p> \n    <p>There was a sharp\
  \ knock. Anandi turned in time to see Captain Maldak open the door. \"How's he doing?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Anandi was in no mood to be civil. \"As well as can be expected after\
  \ a night of carousing.\"</p> \n    <p>The captain shrugged. \"He's used to it.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Your crew was rough with him last night.\" He drew the blanket back\
  \ just enough to expose the welts and bruises along Ravi's back.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  They usually are. Not much I can do. Boy makes his own choices. Here, Ravi.\" He\
  \ tossed a small bottle onto the mattress. Ravi pounced on it and tore at the cork\
  \ with his teeth. Then he stuck the bottle between his lips and drank greedily.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The stink of sour cactus milk turned Anandi's stomach, but he resisted\
  \ the temptation to snatch the bottle away. Now wasn't the time to break him of\
  \ the habit, not when it was likely one of his few pleasures.</p> \n    <p>Sighing\
  \ happily, Ravi nuzzled the pillows. Within a few minutes, the tension left his\
  \ body, and he wore a glazed, vacant expression. </p> \n    <p>\"That's a good boy.\"\
  \ The captain strode over and patted Ravi's cheek. \"He'll be all right by tonight.\
  \ You'll see,\" he said to Anandi.</p> \n    <p>Anandi hoped he wouldn't be here\
  \ long enough for that. Seeing Ravi's poor treatment sickened him.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Share a drink with me, fancy man. Looks like you could use one.\"</p> \n    <p>Reluctant\
  \ as he was to leave Ravi, the opportunity was too good to pass up. Anandi followed\
  \ the captain next door. The room was as gaudy as Anandi would have expected for\
  \ a wealthy captain's lodgings. The silken bedclothes were piled high with pillows.\
  \ The desk and chairs were covered in gilt, as was the bed. Anger filled him again\
  \ that Ravi was treated poorly when the captain lived so well.</p> \n    <p>The\
  \ captain gestured to a small table. \"Sit.\" He picked up a decanter and two glasses\
  \ and joined Anandi. As he poured, he said, \"Now, suppose you tell me your real\
  \ interest in prowling around my villa.\"</p> \n    <p>\"As I told your guard, I'm\
  \ in the market for an item for a certain wizard friend of mine.\" He waited until\
  \ the captain drank before taking a sip of the wine. Delicious.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Magic trinkets and the sort? My hold's full of them. I might be willing to let you\
  \ have one or two, for the right price.\"</p> \n    <p>\"You're generous, sir, but\
  \ the item I seek wouldn't be kept so casually in a ship's hold. It's far too dangerous\
  \ should it fall into the wrong hands.\"</p> \n    <p>The captain's face showed\
  \ nothing. \"And there's some reason you think I have this... item with me?\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Rumors. That's all. My patron sent me to find out.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  What, exactly, are you looking for?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Just a little thing, really.\
  \ A small brass bottle engraved with sigils of binding and capped with a tiger-headed\
  \ stopper.\"</p> \n    <p>The captain laughed and slapped the table so hard the\
  \ glasses jumped. \"You take me for a fool. The Bottle of the Bound has been lost\
  \ for centuries. And even if I did find it, what use would it be to me? I don't\
  \ know the word to release the fiendish army within it, let alone the one to put\
  \ it back.\"</p> \n    <p>No one did, although it was rumored the bottle could be\
  \ opened and the army freed without the proper words. The consequences if that happened\
  \ would be disastrous, which was likely why the Maurya-Rahm wanted the bottle in\
  \ safekeeping.</p> \n    <p>\"I assure you, sir, that bottle is not to be found\
  \ on my ship nor anywhere in this villa.\"</p> \n    <p>Anandi believed him. No\
  \ one would keep such a valuable item on a ship prone to attack and storms. But\
  \ that doesn't mean he doesn't know where it's at. There were so many ruins on Veedesha\
  \ it would be easy to hide such a small thing as a bottle and almost impossible\
  \ to find it without aid. \"I appreciate your candor, Captain. And I would be interested\
  \ in looking at some of your other treasures.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Of course. This way.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>They spent an hour sorting through the captain's trove. Anandi picked\
  \ out and paid for a few knickknacks, items of little interest to the Maurya-Rahm.\
  \ In the end, he expressed his disappointment and took his leave on what, he hoped,\
  \ were good terms.</p> \n    <p>When he went back to Ravi, the half-elf had the\
  \ glazed expression of someone who'd just had a most pleasant dream. \"Hey, fancy\
  \ man. Care to join me?\" He threw back the covers.</p> \n    <p>Anandi stared pointedly\
  \ at the floor. \"No. I've got business to attend to.\" Anything to get out of this\
  \ festering stinkhole.</p> \n    <p>\"Like finding that bottle?\"</p> \n    <p>Fixing\
  \ his gaze on Ravi's face—only his face—Anandi asked, \"What bottle?\"</p> \n  \
  \  <p>Ravi reached under the bed for his clothes. \"I ain't stupid. That old bottle.\
  \ The one Cap probably told you he didn't have. I'll show you where it's at, for\
  \ a price.\" </p> \n    <p>\"Which is?\" Anandi held out a hand to steady the half-elf,\
  \ who teetered as he dressed. </p> \n    <p>The sly smile hinted at something Anandi\
  \ knew all too well. \"Show you when we get there.\"</p> \n    <p><b>Coming Next\
