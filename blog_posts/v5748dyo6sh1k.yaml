  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Welcome to December, Pathfinders!\
  \ As we stated a few weeks ago, our December scenarios arrive a few weeks early\
  \ so that our players have them for the holiday season. If you’re wondering what\
  \ kind of adventures we have in store for you, good news! That’s what James Case\
  \ and I are here to talk about.</p> \n     <p>The first of this month’s adventures\
  \ is a repeatable adventure for levels 1-4. In <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq022bg?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-110-Tarnbreakers-Trail\"\
  ><b>Pathfinder Society Scenario #1–10: Tarnbreaker’s Trail</b></a>, written by the\
  \ author of <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01zsq?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-1004-Reavers-Roar\"\
  >Reaver’s Roar</a>, Steven Hammond, the PCs are called to the unforgiving Lands\
  \ of the Linnorm Kings to participate in a grueling race. Starting in the Ulfen\
  \ city of Kalsgard and traveling to the heart of the Varki nation of Icemark, the\
  \ Balgirdtrek celebrates the travels and trials of an ancient linnorm king named\
  \ Balgird and now serves as an event celebrating the new age of cooperation between\
  \ the Ulfen and Varki peoples. Unfortunately, not everyone is happy to see the Pathfinder\
  \ Society represented in this race and the PCs will need to contend not only against\
  \ the harsh environment but with sabotage from some of their less scrupulous competition.\
  \ In the tradition of scenarios like <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy9k95?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-7-22-Bid-for-Alabastrine\"\
  >Bid for Alabastrine</a>, Tarnbreaker’s Trail is rife with opportunities for roleplay\
  \ but light on combat. </p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/121219_OrgPlayPFSRetiringChampion.jpg\"\

  \ \n     </div> \n     <p>The second scenario of the month, written by yours truly,\
  \ Michael Sayre, is <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq022bh?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-111-Flames-of-Rebellion\"\
  ><b>Pathfinder Society Scenario #1–11: Flames of Rebellion</b></a>. Continuing this\
  \ season’s metaplot, the PCs travel to the town of Sauerton in the Andoran countryside\
  \ in search of clues that the Society’s leaders can use to unravel the secrets of\
  \ the mysterious Open Door Pact. The PCs won’t be in the countryside for long though,\
  \ as their mission leads them to the long-abandoned tower known as Diggen’s Rest.\
  \ Well, as they soon discover, long-abandoned by someone at some point. </p> \n\

  \     </div> \n     <p>For this month’s quest, we turn the blog over to organized\
  \ play developer James Case</p> \n     <p>Last but not least (except kind of because\
  \ it is shorter since it’s a quest), we have a holiday-themed adventure for the\
  \ festive season in <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq022bt?Pathfinder-Society-Quest-5-The-Dragon-Who-Stole-Evoking-Day\"\
  ><b>Quest #5: The Dragon Who Stole Evoking Day</b></a>, written for levels 3–6 by\
  \ Paizo developer Luis Loza. The desert city of Sothis is getting ready for Evoking\
  \ Day, a sacred day full of feasting, dancing, brilliant magic and pyrotechnics\
  \ in celebration of Nethys, the God of Magic. Unfortunately, this year it seems\
  \ that one resident finally had enough of the constant explosions disturbing their\
  \ sleep and stole the wands and fireworks needed for the festivities. The PCs must\
  \ track down the culprit and get the holiday supplies back.</p> \n     <div class=\"\
