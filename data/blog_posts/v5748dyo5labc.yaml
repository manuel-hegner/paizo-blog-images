  0\" align=\"right\"></a> \n   <blockquote> \n    <p>First off, the new Valeros is\
  \ designed to dish out the hurt, but his AC is a bit low for a character of his\
  \ level. He can fix this in combat by using Combat Expertise, which at his level\
  \ gives him a +4 dodge bonus to his AC (which also adds to his Combat Maneuver Defense,\
  \ but more on that later) but taking a –4 penalty on attack rolls for 1 round. He\
  \ can also used Power Attack to add +8 damage on attacks made with his longsword\
  \ and +4 damage on attacks made with his shortsword by taking an additional –4 penalty\
  \ on attack rolls. He would probably not want to use both at the same time, but\
  \ he can mix it up as dictated by the situation. If he manages to hit one target\
  \ with both his longsword and shortsword in the same round, he deals an additional\
  \ 1d10+4 points of damage thanks to Two-Weapon Rend.</p> \n    <p>All of this assumes\
  \ that Valeros begins his turn adjacent to an enemy. If not, he can charge up and\
  \ make a single attack with his longsword using both Power Attack and Improved Vital\
  \ Strike. This devastating attack is made at a +23 bonus and it deals 3d8+21. Note\
  \ that Valeros can move 30 feet during this charge, despite wearing a breastplate.\
  \ This is due to his armor training, which allows him to move at full speed while\
  \ wearing such armor.</p> \n    <p>You might notice a new statistic in Valeros'\
  \ stat block. CMD, which stands for Combat Maneuver Defense. This statistic is the\
  \ DC for anyone else to perform a combat maneuver, such as bull rush, disarm, or\
  \ grapple, against Valeros. This statistic is derived from his CMB +10 plus a number\
  \ of other modifiers (Dexterity and deflection bonuses in this case). Note that\
  \ Valeros adds his weapon training bonuses to his CMD whenever anyone tries to disarm\
  \ or sunder weapons from those groups (he also adds these bonuses to combat maneuver\
  \ checks made using weapons from those groups).</p> \n    <p>Lastly, Valeros has\
  \ some fun magic items at his disposal. You can never go wrong with a <i>necklace\
  \ of fireballs</i> (type V), especially when you are wearing fire resistant armor.\
  \ The <i>periapt of wound closure</i> protects him from bleed damage, which is a\
  \ bit more common with some of the new higher-level feats (Bleeding Critical comes\
  \ to mind). Lastly, the <i>ring of the ram</i> is a great toy for a fighter like\
  \ Valeros to control the battlefield a bit. Using just 1 charge allows him to make\
  \ a bull rush combat maneuver at a +17 bonus, which should be enough to push smaller\
  \ monsters around.</p> \n    <p>That's about all for this week. There are a few\
  \ other tidbits hidden in the stat block for the math savvy, but I will leave those\
  \ for the messageboards to puzzle out. Next week, in part 3 of our 14-week preview,\
  \ we're going to take a close look at Seoni, the iconic sorcerer. And by close,\
  \ I mean very close, close enough to examine her blood.</p> \n    <p> Jason Bulmahn\
