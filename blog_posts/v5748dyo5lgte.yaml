  > \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Can you smell the season's tidings in the air?\
  \ No, not the crisp-cold scent of pine logs in your neighbor's fireplace in the\
  \ wintry morning breeze. It's the smell of fresh ink and cardstock. Welcome to that\
  \ special time of year, boon and bane to gamers everywhere.</p> \n     <p>With BGG.CON\
  \ behind us, we wave goodbye to another convention season as all the treasures they\
  \ promised now appear in Friendly Local Game Stores across the land. Our arms are\
  \ laden with new games to play and hope for a long snow day lingers on our bright,\
  \ eager faces—board game season is here!</p> \n     <p>As holiday schedules wreak\
  \ havoc on dedicated adventuring groups, there's treasure to be snatched from Old\
  \ Man Winter's icy grip... if you dare! Or, to put it another way, no one wants\
  \ to spend another family gathering sulking in the corner and searching her pudding\
  \ for plums when there's adventuring to be done!</p> \n     <h2>Tip 1: Play with\
  \ Strangers! (or as strange as you can get)</h2> \n     <p>Have you played PACG\
  \ with strangers yet? I highly recommend it. It's the fun of Pathfinder in bite-sized,\
  \ no-DM-needed pieces in a handy, portable box. Organized play through the <a href=\"\
  /pfsacg\">Adventure Card Guild</a> also has the magical power to be more fun than\
  \ it should be, even with the most incongruous of game groups. This is where I could\
  \ ramble on about the nuances of the cooperative game design principles that guided\
  \ the game's development, but let's just say a wizard did it. And no, Mike Selinker\
  \ is not actually a wizard. (He's a sorcerer—it's a nuanced but important distinction.)</p>\

  ></a> \n     </div> \n     <p>One of the best parts of my job is getting to play\
  \ games with all kinds of people. BGG.CON was especially delightful, getting to\
  \ play with fans of the game and new players alike. I got to outrun ghosts with\
  \ a power gamer whose character deck is tuned like a well-oiled machine. I hammered\
  \ Hammerheads with a father and daughter pair who, much to their delight, won with\
  \ a pirate (as Jirelle the swashbuckler) and uncovered buried treasure while sporting\
  \ both an Eye Patch and a Parrot.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\

  \ Try Organized Play</h2> \n     <p>So your regular gaming group is in shambles\
  \ this month because one does not simply incur the disappointment of grandmas. Or,\
  \ locked in your wintry fortress, you've already played through the S&amp;S adventures\
  \ so far. Enter the glorious balm of <a href=\"/pfsacg/products\">Pathfinder Society\
  \ Adventure Card Guild scenarios</a>, played in your very own home!</p> \n     <p>Slip\
  \ them into your Base Set on their own (for an off-the-books experience) or play\
  \ with <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/classDecks\">Class Decks</a> and\
  \ the <a href=\"/products/btpy98no\"><em>Guide to Adventure Card Guild Organized\
  \ Play</em></a>. You can break out Card Guild scenarios for a quick dose of fresh\
  \ PACG without the guilt of cheating on your regular adventuring group. Would Sir\
  \ or Madam enjoy a shark-hunting rampage? Might I suggest <a href=\"/products/btpy992e\"\
  ><em>Season of the Shackles Scenario 1-B: The Lone Shark</em></a>?</p> \n     <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZOACGS0001E-LoneShark.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZOACGS0001E-LoneShark_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n     </div> \n     <h2>Tip 3: Snow Day Marathon!</h2> \n     <p>Forget the\
  \ cold and gloom outside; spend your snow day with hot toddies and hours free to\
  \ chase down villains all over the Shackles. How far can you get through the Skull\
  \ &amp; Shackles adventure path in one day?</p> \n     <p>Don't have a snow day?\
  \ No problem. 'Tis the season for holing up with friends on a weekend once the gilded\
  \ lights come down. (Who am I kidding? I consider it an accomplishment if I clear\
  \ up the decorations by Valentine's.) Happy Board Game Season, everybody!</p> \n\
