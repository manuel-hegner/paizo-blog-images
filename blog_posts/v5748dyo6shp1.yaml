  description\">I thought about writing “no musings, head empty, only PaizoCon” in\
  \ this space but <s>Tonya told me I couldn’t</s> I decided against it. Instead,\
  \ I’m going to take this space to give a shout-out to some people who went above\
  \ and beyond in making PaizoCon Online happen this year. Please note that I’m writing\
  \ this two days <em>before</em> the convention due to deadlines, so if I forgot\
  \ someone, I can still blame Convention Brain.</p> \n     <p>First up, the PaizoCon\
  \ Online Organizing Committee: <b>David Peevers, Ivis Flanagan, and Mike Bramnik</b>,\
  \ who volunteered days of their lives (probably weeks, if we total them up) to coordinating\
  \ all our GMs for Organized Play games. The event <em>literally</em> would not have\
  \ happened without the three of them, and they all deserve a tropical vacation somewhere.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Next, our HQ volunteers for PaizoCon Online: <b>Aerine Caerwyn, Barb\
  \ Crase, Nicole Heits, Katrina Hennessy, Sebastian Hirsch, Alex Lenz, Rich Lowe\
  \ (Stunt Monkey), Elizabeth “Betsy” Nold, and Betty Osthoff</b>. You’ll recognize\
  \ these names as “those people who were everywhere on the Discord server,” as they\
  \ got walk-ups seated, coordinated with GMs, and just generally made sure all the\
  \ machinery was running smoothly. <b>Eric Nielsen</b> gets a special shout-out to\
  \ himself, as he programmed the reporting tool used by our GMs to report their games.\
  \ <br> [Tonya’s Note: We really couldn’t pull off an event without all our volunteers—\
  the organizing committee, GMs, and HQ—and we thank them from the deepest depths\
  \ of our hearts! A huge huzzah to them for stepping up and providing over 800 games\
  \ to our attendees! I’m honored to be part of such a fabulous community!]</p> \n\
  \     <p>Finally, I want to recognize some of our Paizo staffers. First, I want\
  \ to thank <b>Aaron Shanks</b> and <b>Leah Beckelman</b>, our Marketing team, put\
  \ together the streams, blogs, and emails for the weekend, as well as <b>John Feil</b>\
  \ for the giveaways you all enjoyed. <b>Linda Zayas-Palmer, Thurston Hillman, Jenny\
  \ Jarzabski,</b> and <b>Mike Kimmel</b> are my colleagues on the Organized Play\
  \ Team who worked their tails off to get scenarios out to our GMs <em>much</em>\
  \ earlier than ever before. Finally, a big thank you to all our Paizo staff who\
  \ moderated or participated in panels and Discord discussions; the staff participation\
  \ is what makes PaizoCon what it is.<br> [Tonya’s Note: And a huge thanks to Alex\
  \ Speidel for taking on the bulk of the Org Play planning and organizing so I could\
  \ focus on pulling things together. He is amazing and an integral part of our operations!\
  \ To Alex and all the Paizo staff for doing such a fantastic job on PaizoCon, hooray!]</p>\
  \ \n     <p>All right, that’s enough words from me. Let’s do this again next year,\
  \ yeah?</p> \n     <h2>Starfinder Society Year 4</h2> \n     <p>Last weekend at\
  \ PaizoCon Online, we launched Year 4 of Starfinder Society! Remember that <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shoe?Starfinder-Society-Year-4-Rule-Changes\"\
  >the rules in the latest Guide update</a> are now in effect, and <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shng?Starfinder-Society-Update-Year-4-Program-Changes\"\
  >all scenarios played from this point on should not award Fame, but do award Achievement\
  \ Points</a> for Starfinder Society.</p> \n     <p>We hope you enjoyed the new scenarios\
  \ at PaizoCon Online, and we look forward to unraveling the mysteries of the Year\
  \ of the Data Scourge!</p> \n     <h2>Pathfinder Society Year 3</h2> \n     <p>Now\
  \ that Starfinder Society’s new storyline has launched, our attention is turning\
  \ to Pathfinder Society. We encourage Pathfinder Society players to read the blog\
  \ next Thursday to learn exciting news about Year 3!</p> \n     <h2>Sanctioning</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>In the lead-up to PaizoCon Online, we put our various noses to the grindstone\
  \ to get plenty of new content sanctioned for play! The following content has been\
  \ sanctioned in the past month:</p> \n     <p><b><a href=\"https://paizo.com/pathfinderSociety/characteroptions\"\
  >Pathfinder Society (second edition)</a></b></p> \n     <ul> \n      <li><a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/products/btq027mn?Pathfinder-Bestiary-3\"><em>Bestiary 3</em></a></li>\
  \ \n      <li><a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq027ug?Pathfinder-OneShot-2-Dinner-at-Lionlodge\"\
  ><em>One-Shot #2: Dinner at Lionlodge</em></a></li> \n      <li><a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq027qf?Pathfinder-Adventure-Malevolence\"\
  ><em>Malevolence</em></a></li> \n     </ul> \n     <p><b><a href=\"https://paizo.com/starfindersociety/characteroptions\"\
  >Starfinder Society</a></b></p> \n     <ul> \n      <li><a href=\"https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventures/adventurePath/devastationArk\"\
  >The Devastation Ark Adventure Path</a></li> \n      <li><a href=\"https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventures/adventurePath/flyFreeOrDie\"\
  ><em>Fly Free or Die Adventure Path</em></a></li> \n      <li><a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq027uo?Starfinder-OneShot-1-Band-on-the-Run\"\
  ><em>One-Shot #1: Band on the Run</em></a></li> \n     </ul> \n     <p>Do note that\
  \ while Chronicle Sheets and reporting are now available for the Starfinder Adventure\
  \ Paths, their character options are not yet; we aim to have these out by the end\
  \ of the month, but they are taking just a little bit longer due to PaizoCon preparations.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Next on our agenda are <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq027ot?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-The-Mwangi-Expanse\"\
  ><em>Lost Omens Mwangi Expanse</em></a>, the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/fistsOfTheRubyPhoenix\"\
  ><em>Fists of the Ruby Phoenix</em> Adventure Path</a> and the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/strengthOfThousands\"\
  ><em>Strength of Thousands</em> Adventure Path</a> for Pathfinder Society (second\
  \ edition), the character options from <em>Fly Free or Die</em> and <em>Devastation\
  \ Ark</em>, the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq027ud?Starfinder-Galaxy-Exploration-Manual\"\
  ><em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em></a> and <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq026l2?Starfinder-Adventure-Junkers-Delight\"\
  ><em>Junker’s Delight</em></a> for Starfinder Society, and the outstanding Pathfinder\
  \ Society (first edition) content. Now that we’re caught up with the content in\
  \ both active programs, we hope to continue sanctioning at or near the product release\
  \ dates going forward.</p> \n     <h2>Campaign Coins and Order of the Wayfinder</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>At the end of PaizoCon Online, we gave out several Campaign Coins to\
  \ exemplary volunteers. These volunteers have gone above and beyond the call of\
  \ duty, and are recognized with a metal coin and an updated Organized Play ID number.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Jared Thaler &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>842</b><br> Mark Koopman &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>843</b><br>\
  \ Eric Nielsen &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>844</b><br> Michael Tracey &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>845</b></p>\
  \ \n     <p>In addition, each year we select one person to receive the Order of\
  \ the Wayfinder. This award recognizes a volunteer whose efforts on a particular\
  \ project merit the highest honor the Society can give. We consult with the previous\
  \ recipients to make our determination.</p> \n     <p>For 2020, we have awarded\
  \ the Order of the Wayfinder to <b>Jesse Davis</b>, RVC of the Online region. Without\
  \ Jesse’s work setting up the Online region, we never would have made it through\
  \ the transition into online play during the pandemic. He has been a tireless advocate\
  \ for online play, and we’re happy to grant him this award, as well as Organized\
  \ Play ID <b>105</b>.</p> \n     <h2>GM Recognition</h2> \n     <p>Whether stars,\
  \ novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial\
  \ amount of time. To achieve their fifth milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of\
  \ which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios, as well as\
  \ run between one and three games for venture-captains (program dependent). A conservative\
  \ estimate of the time needed to reach the fifth milestone is 650 hours!</p> \n\
  \     <p>Two GMs received their fifth star in the past month. In addition, we are\
  \ pleased to announce our first 5-Glyph GM for Pathfinder Society (second edition)!</p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>5th Star (PFS1)</b>: Erika Emrick, Dave Williamson<br> <b>5th Glyph\
  \ (PFS2)</b>: Eric Nielsen</p> \n     <p>Congratulations to our new 5-Star and 5-Glyph\
  \ GMs, and thank you for your dedication! If you believe you have achieved your\
  \ 5th rank but haven’t been announced, email us at <a href=\"mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com.\"\
  >organizedplay@paizo.com</a>.</p> \n     <h2>Upcoming Conventions</h2> \n     <p>Last\
  \ week, we posted <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shoh?PaizoCon-Europe-Online-2021-Tickets-GM\"\
  >an update on PaizoCon Online Europe</a>. If you’re interested in GMing or playing\
  \ at this event, where we’ll be launching Year 3 of Pathfinder Society, check out\
  \ that post!</p> \n     <p>In addition, we’ve got a new shiny page for you: our\
  \ brand new <a href=\"https://paizo.com/conventions\">Paizo Conventions calendar</a>!\
  \ This page will list any convention that has filed for event support. Clicking\
