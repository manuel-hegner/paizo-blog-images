  artist: "stone of at least 1-foot thickness or lead sheathing, as well as by force\
    \ effects. Contact with blightburn causes immediate pain, blistering of skin,\
    \ and 2d6 points of fire damage per round. In addition, the radiation poisons\
    \ anyone within 60 feet with blightburn, a deadly disease (Fort DC 22, Incubation\
    \ instantaneous, 1d6 Con/1d6 Cha); victims of this sickness grow increasingly\
    \ frail as sores erupt on their bodies, hair falls out, and bones grow shockingly\
    \ brittle. Teleportation spells function poorly in areas where blightburn is presentâ€”\
    in order to successfully cast such a spell in a cavern that has blightburn crystals\
    \ in its walls or to teleport to such a location, a spellcaster must succeed on\
    \ a DC 30 caster level check. James Jacobs Pathfinder Editor-in-Chief"
