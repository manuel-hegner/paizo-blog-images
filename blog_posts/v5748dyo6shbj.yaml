  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">With the release of the\
  \ <em>Starfinder Tech Revolution Playtest</em>, the Starfinder Society Organized\
  \ Play Program is also opening its doors to a limited form of playtest, specifically\
  \ for the nanocyte class. Since this class won't be released until 2021, we're looking\
  \ at allowing players the chance to test out this new during the playtest period.\

  \ The availability for these rules runs from the publishing of this post until the\
  \ end of the playtest period (September 18th, 2020.) Once this period has expired,\
  \ players can no longer use the Starfinder Tech Revolution Playtest class until\
  \ the publication of the book in 2021.</p> \n     <p><b>How It Works</b>: We're\
  \ opening up Society play for the playtest class via the use of custom-created characters\
  \ that operate much like our pregenerated characters. We believe this should encourage\
  \ players to test the waters with custom builds, be it with current scenarios or\
  \ through our growing stable of repeatable options.</p> \n     <p><b>Creating a\
  \ Playtest Character</b>: Prior to playing a scenario in the playtest period, a\
  \ player can determine if they want to playtest the new class. Depending on the\
  \ tier of the scenario, the player can then use a 1st-, 4th- or 8th-level character\
  \ using the nanocyte class presented in the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/starfinderplaytest\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Tech Revolution</em> Playtest</a> and created using the following\
  \ guidelines:</p> \n     <ul> \n      <li><b>Class</b>: The character must have\
  \ all levels in the nanocyte class. Although multiclassing ramifications are important\
  \ for the playtest as a whole, we're keeping to single classes in the organized\
  \ play portion of the playtest for simplicity.</li> \n      <li><b>1st Level</b>:\
  \ The character can be created using the character creation rules presented in the\
  \ <em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em> and <em>Guide</em> to <em>Organized Play: Starfinder\
  \ Society</em>.</li> \n      <li><b>4th Level</b>: This character follows the same\
  \ rules as above, except it can select one 4th-level armor or weapon and one 3rd-level\
  \ armor or weapon. In addition, the player can spend up to 4,000 credits on other\
  \ available equipment.</li> \n      <li><b>8th Level</b>: This character follows\
  \ the same rules as above, except it can select one 8th-level armor or weapon and\
  \ one 7th-level armor or weapon. In addition, the player can spend up to 18,000\
  \ credits on other available equipment.</li> \n     </ul> \n     <p><b>Credit</b>:\
  \ The credit earned for playing a playtest character follows the same rules and\
  \ guidelines as presented on page 7 of the <em>Guide to Organized Play: Starfinder\
  \ Society</em>. This means that you must choose which of your characters will receive\
  \ the credit at the beginning of the adventure. Credit must be assigned to characters\
  \ of lower level than the playtest character. </p>\n     <p><b>Resolving Conditions</b>:\
  \ We recognize that players taking the opportunity to playtest these characters\
  \ are performing a service for the game and campaign. As a result, whenever a player\
  \ playtests a 4th- or 8th-level version of these characters, the cost to purchase\
  \ a <em>raise dead</em> is reduced to 6 Fame and subsequent restorations to remove\
  \ the negative levels are only 1 Fame each. This means that there's still some risk\
  \ to your established characters, but the penalty for dying as a playtest character\
  \ is far less onerous than it would be for a normal character or pregenerated character.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>Applying Credit</b>: As we want to encourage extra play of the higher-level\
  \ versions of the nanocyte, we're also going to open up the rules for applying credit\
  \ when playing a playtest character. A player using a non-1st-level playtest character\
  \ may choose to apply the earned Chronicle Sheet to an existing Organized Play character.\
  \ To do so, simply replace the credits earned on the Chronicle Sheet with credits\
  \ from the list below that match the level range of the existing player character.</p>\
  \ \n     <ul> \n      <li>Levels 1-2: 720 credits (2,160 credits for Adventure Path\
  \ module)</li> \n      <li>Levels 3-4: 1,460 credits (4,380 credits for Adventure\
  \ Path module)</li> \n      <li>Levels 5-6: 4,085 credits (12,255 credits for Adventure\
  \ Path module)</li> \n      <li>Levels 7-8: 5,835 credits (17,505 credits for Adventure\
  \ Path module)</li> \n     </ul> \n     <p><b>Mechs</b>: Organized Play does not\
  \ have a direct connection with the mech playtest that is occurring simultaneously\
  \ with the nanocyte playtest. However, we strongly recommend that members of the\
  \ Paizo Organized Play community get involved with testing the new mech system and\
  \ providing feedback. Weâ€™ve made sure that the mech survey captures Organized Play\
  \ member involvement, so we can further analyze the impact our community has on\
  \ these various playtests.</p> \n     <p>With all this in mind, we encourage our\
  \ players to take an active part in the playtest, both by sharing your opinions\
  \ online in the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/forums/starfinder/playtest\"\
  >Playtest forums</a> and by completing the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/starfinderplaytest\"\
  >playtest surveys</a>. We hope that by opening up the means in which players can\
  \ create and customize characters for the playtest, that we can see some unique\
  \ and fun builds using this new class and that such tests will provide the design\
  \ team with priceless \"field agent\" feedback!</p>\n     <p> </p>\n     <p>I look\
  \ forward to hearing from each of you about your experiences with the <em>Starfinder\
  \ Tech Revolution</em> nanocyte class and am even more excited to see this class\
  \ join the roster of Starfinder classes officially in 2021.</p> \n     <p style=\"\
