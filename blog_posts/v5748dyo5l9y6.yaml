  \ Fight!</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, August 26, 2008</p> \n   <p>Last time\
  \ I discussed how Otis Adelbert Kline, author of <i><a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy80hr\"\
  >The Swordsman of Mars</a></i>, ties into the overall idea of Planet Storiesâ€”a forgotten\
  \ master in the Edgar Rice Burroughs tradition, who set precedents both through\
  \ his own work and as a member of the <i>Weird Tales</i> editorial staff (not to\
  \ mention as the literary agent for Conan creator Robert E. Howard). This week,\
  \ however, I'd like to focus the spotlight on the one reason for republishing <i><a\
  \ href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy80hr\">The Swordsman of Mars</a></i> that we haven't\
  \ talked about yet:</p> \n   <p>Because it's <i>fun</i>.</p> \n   <p>In order to\
  \ illustrate that, I've picked one of my favorite sections and included a snippet\
  \ from it here. Though there are a number of memorable scenes, one of my favorite\
  \ things about Kline is the new monsters he invents, and this scene features not\
  \ just one, but <i>three</i> of his motley creations... and that's just on one page.\
  \ Let's hear it for authors who aren't stingy with their beasties!</p> \n   <blockquote>\
  \ \n    <p>For some time the Earth-man was too busy getting his breath to take note\
  \ of his surroundings. Then he looked around for his mount, and saw it swimming\
  \ directly away from him at a distance of about three hundred yards. Although the\
  \ gawr was moving at a speed which he could not possibly hope to equal, he was about\
  \ to set out in futile pursuit when a huge and terrible reptilian head suddenly\
  \ reared itself between them, a scaly, silver neck. The monster looked first at\
  \ the retreating gawr, then at the man, and evidently deciding that the latter would\
  \ be the easier prey, began gliding swiftly toward him.</p> \n    <p>Thorne glanced\
  \ around him. Although it seemed utterly futile for him even to attempt to make\
  \ the shore, about a quarter of a mile distant, where a dense fringe of trees nodded\
  \ over the water, no other avenue of escape was open to him, and he struck out desperately.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>It was manifest from the start that he could not hope to outstrip his\
  \ fearful aquatic enemy. As he forged ahead with long, powerful overhand strokes,\
  \ he glanced back from time to time, and saw that the monster was swiftly gaining\
  \ on him. Soon the terrific pace began to tell on him. His arms grew numb, and it\
  \ seemed that they moved automatically, while breathing momentarily became more\
  \ difficult. But the thought of those dreadful jaws, now gaping close behind him,\
  \ spurred him on. </p> \n    <p>With the shore but two hundred feet distant, he\
  \ felt this last ounce of strength ebbing. A backward glance showed his monstrous\
  \ pursuer so near that it was arching its neck for the kill. Then just ahead of\
  \ him he noticed a tiny ripple of water, and there emerged a pair of jaws like those\
  \ of a crocodile, but larger than those of any crocodile he had ever seen or heard\
  \ of. There followed a broad, flat head, and thick neck, both covered with glossy\
  \ fur, the head black, the neck ringed with a bright yellow band.</p> \n    <p>Hemmed\
  \ thus between the two aquatic monsters, he did the only thing left for him to do.\
  \ Filling his lungs, he plunged beneath the surface and dived under the oncoming\
  \ beast. For a moment he heard the rush and swirl of the swimming thing above him,\
  \ and felt the eddying currents which it kicked downward and backward. These passed,\
  \ he forged onward, remaining under water until compelled to return to the surface\
  \ for air.</p> \n    <p>When he had shaken the water out of his eyes, Thorne saw\
  \ a fearsome sight. The two monsters had met, and were engaged in a terrific struggle.\
  \ The silver-gray scales of the one which had been following him flashed in the\
  \ sun as it endeavored to shake off its small adversary which had seized it by the\
  \ lower lip.</p> \n    <p>Suddenly it reared its head until the black-furred creature\
  \ was drawn completely out of the water, and he saw that the latter was a web-footed\
  \ animal about as large as a full-grown terrestrial lion, with short legs and a\
  \ leathery, paddle-shaped tail which was edged with sharp spines. With the exception\
  \ of the tail and claws, the body was covered with fur. The scaly monster shook\
  \ its head, dislodging its smaller enemy and losing most of its lower lip in the\
  \ process. Then, as the furry creature splashed into the water, it arched its neck\
  \ and struck.</p> \n    <p>Thorne expected to see the smaller creature instantly\
  \ slain. Instead he saw a startling demonstration of its superior cunning and quickness.\
  \ With a speed his eye could scarcely follow, it avoided the lunge of that terrible\
  \ head, and turning, seized the slender, stalklike neck of its adversary in its\
  \ own relatively large jaws. One powerful crunch, and the battle was over. The severed\
  \ head sank from sight, and the huge body, floundering about with reptilian tenacity\
  \ to life, churned the water to a foam and sent huge waves scurrying in all directions.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>So absorbed had he been in this strange battle that Thorne had momentarily\
  \ forgotten his own exhaustion and the peril that menaced him. Now, as the victor\
  \ turned from the carcass of its vanquished enemy and swam straight toward him,\
  \ the realization of his danger redoubled. He struck out for the shore, essaying\
  \ the fast overhand stroke he had previously used on the surface, but his weary\
  \ muscles had reached the limit of their endurance. A few feeble efforts, and a\
  \ backward glance at the swiftly moving beast, convinced him that he was doomed.\
  \ Better death by drowning than in those horrible jaws. He filled his lungs and\
  \ dived. At a depth of about fifteen feet he found a large water plant to which\
  \ he clung with his last remaining strength. </p>\n    <p>But it seemed he was not\
  \ even to be given his choice of deaths. Suddenly he became aware of the dark object\
  \ in the green water above him. Then a huge jaw closed around his waist...</p> \n\
