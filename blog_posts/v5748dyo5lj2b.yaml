  \    </div> \n    <p>Hey there! Josh Vogt speaking... er... typing. I hate to interrupt\
  \ your regularly scheduled Pathfinder Tales blog post that James Sutter usually\
  \ provides, but he's so focused on Starfinder these days that I think I can steal\
  \ his slot without him noticing until it's too late... </p> \n    <div class=\"\

  >If you ever get the chance to meet Wendy Wagner in person, you'll likely come away\
  \ a little dazzled by the joyful energy she projects. It's practically impossible\
  \ to not to get swept up in her enthusiasm about any topic you happen to latch on\
  \ to, be it a favorite recipe or a fantastic horror flick. Whatever the project,\
  \ Wendy is sure to bring a real passion to it.</p> \n    <p>The thing is, this same\
  \ energy comes through in her writing. In her first Pathfinder Tales novel, <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy94r1\"><em>Skinwalkers</em></a>, Wendy introduced us to Jendara, an\
  \ ex-pirate who'd given up her marauding ways to try and raise her son. However,\
  \ raids by a brutal clan of shapeshifters threatens the safety of her island home,\
  \ and Jendara must use her wits and axe-wielding prowess to defend those she cares\
  \ for at all costs.</p> \n    <p>Reading <em>Skinwalkers</em> made me realize I'd\
  \ never want to get into a cage match with Wendy, because she refuses to pull a\
  \ punch. Her characters feel incredibly vibrant and alive. Her action scenes leave\
  \ you breathless. Her descriptions can be brutally detailed (did I mention her penchant\
  \ for horror, both subtle and shocking?). So when I heard that Wendy would be tackling\
  \ another Pathfinder Tales novel, <a href=\"/products/btpy9j5o\"><em>Starspawn</em></a>,\
  \ I was thoroughly excited, even before I found out the premise would be... </p>\
  \ \n    <p>Vikings versus Cthulhu.</p> \n    <p>Vikings. Versus. Cthulhu.</p> \n\
  \    <p>I mean, come on—I could practically see Wendy grinning with glee at being\
  \ able to pit seafaring barbarians against Lovecraftian horrors. And I knew she'd\
  \ do a smashing job of it, too.</p> \n    <p>In <em>Starspawn</em>, Jendara returns,\
  \ and is once more trying to find a measure of peace in life. Yet the stars are\
  \ aligned against her, and when an unnatural tsunami devastates the area, it leaves\
  \ a mysterious island in its wake. Strange structures, murderous cultists, and mind-twisting\
  \ art are just a few of the disturbing elements Jendara and her crew encounter on\
  \ exploring the new island—but these are hardly the most terrifying things they'll\
  \ be forced to face before the end.</p> \n    <p>So get ready for Wendy to ramp\
  \ up the adventure, the horror, and the thrills, all while delving into the sanity-skewing\
  \ intersection of the Elder Mythos and Golarion—a perfect appetizer to get you in\
  \ the mood for the new <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/strangeAeons\">Strange\
  \ Aeons Adventure Path</a>. I know I'll be enjoying the adrenaline rush the whole\
  \ way.</p> \n    <p style=\"clear: both;\">Josh Vogt<br> <i>Editor</i></p> \n  \
