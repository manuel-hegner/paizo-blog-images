  \ \n       <p><b>What’s your full name and title?</b><br> <em>Venture-Captain Sigvard\
  \ Tornkvist the Risen.</em></p> \n       <p><b>How did you become an adventurer?</b><br>\
  \ <em>In my village, tucked away on the border of Molthune and Nirmathas, lived\
  \ a retired Pathfinder. He would tell stories of his adventures, and I’d share my\
  \ visions. After sharing visions of a rising tide engulfing a floating city lit\
  \ by a radiant white stone and of monkeys climbing a black basalt tower, he sponsored\
  \ my admission to the Pathfinder Society. I trained at the Grand Lodge, then entered\
  \ active duty as a Pathfinder agent</em></p> \n       <p><b>How did you become a\
  \ Venture-Captain in the Society?</b><br> <em>After defeating the Thorned Monarch,\
  \ we established the Lodge of the Open Road. Gregaro Voth, being both ancient and\
  \ tied to the lodge, felt he wasn’t the person to lead. For my contributions to\
  \ the Society over the years, Eliza offered the position to me. In Voth I found\
  \ a kindred soul and his experience supports my knowledge of the Society. I think\
  \ we make a perfect pair.</em></p> \n       <p><b>Did you support any Factions during\
  \ your adventuring career?</b><br> <em>I aided several Factions. First, Osirion.\
  \ I fell in love with the sandswept valleys and rugged mountainous peaks while reading\
  \ the ancient tomes during training. I traveled there at the first opportunity,\
  \ and when I died at the hands of a manticore, the Ruby Prince arranged my return\
  \ and granted me a position in the Risen Guard. When Amenopheus fell out of favor\
  \ with the Ruby Prince, I followed Amenopheus to the Scarab Sages as he pursued\
  \ knowledge of his past. After his removal as leader in favor of Tahonikepsu, I\
  \ continued to support the Sages. As their mission wrapped up, I focused more on\
  \ service directly to the Society, helping behind the scenes with research and divinations.</em></p>\
  \ \n       <p><b>What is some advice you have for the newest Pathfinder recruits?</b><br>\
  \ <em>Don’t discount divination magics. I’ve heard talk that it isn’t a real school\
  \ of magic, that it’s practitioners are lesser magicians. I cannot count the times\
  \ my knowledge of a situation allowed my team to effectively handle a situation.\
  \ In all the years of adventuring, teams I was in lost less than five allies, and\
  \ of those we beseeched Pharasma to return all but one to life. Even my own death\
  \ was preventable, if I would have focused and prepared instead of just running\
  \ into the fray.</em></p> \n       <p><b>Who is the most formidable opponent you’\
  ve dealt with?</b><br> <em>Grandmaster Torch. Even my skills didn’t allow me to\
  \ see his layer upon layer upon layer situation. So much to unpack from his beginnings\
  \ as a Pathfinder to his later works. In the end, he embodies such pathos that one\
  \ can’t help but feel for him. I expect it is why I and my fellow Pathfinders allowed\
  \ him to leave the field alive when we last met.</em></p> \n       <p><b>Who do\
  \ you see as the Pathfinder Society’s ultimate foe?</b><br> <em>Ourselves. In our\
  \ hubris, we do not prepare. By not preparing, we allow travesty to happen. We knew\
  \ the Whispering Tyrant would escape, for what prison is secure? But we chose to\
  \ not keep close enough eye on his doings. We should have known there was corruption\
  \ in the Decemvirate. Anonymity and the resources of the Society cannot but tempt\
  \ someone to baser acts. Only in preparation can we hope to defeat any new travails.\
  \ </em></p> \n       <p><b>Do you have any rituals or habits you perform while adventuring?</b><br>\
  \ <em>I start the day with a cup of tea and a divination ritual. Once I glean a\
  \ sense of what is to come, I am ready to start my day. The last thing I do before\
  \ bed is check my crossbow, making sure the string is good and it will work if needed.\
  \ For while I wield the power of the arcane, nothing can compare to a tidy bolt\
  \ between the eyes of an enemy.</em></p> \n       <p><b>Do you have a set group\
  \ you adventure with?</b><br> <em>My first assignment was to the Blakros Museum\
  \ of Absalom. They were having issues with a strange mist. My companions on that\
  \ journey were Tragar, a dwarven ranger, Aramil, a half-elf alchemist, and Bo-Dean,\
  \ a Gebbite follower of Asmodeus, and Grinkle, a gnome infiltrator. Unfortunately,\
  \ Grinkle flew from the top of a ziggurat and retired from Pathfinding shortly afterward.\
  \ But the rest of us worked well together, so we formed a core group and spent many\
  \ years wandering together. Eight years later, we settled down and unfortunately\
  \ grew apart, though I do keep in regular contact with Bo-Dean and sporadic contact\
  \ with Aramil. I haven’t heard from Tragar in some years. We were planning one final\
  \ adventure together, but alas, it hasn’t happened.</em></p> \n       <p><b>What\
  \ do you never leave home without?</b><br> <em>My spellbook. It is gorgeous old\
  \ leather tome with the Osirian scarab on it. My parents commissioned it upon my\
  \ completion of my Confirmation. It reminds me of them and holds my most important\
  \ possession. Without it, I would be lost. Though if you asked my companions, it\
  \ would be my crossbow. </em></p> \n       <p><b>When you’re not working for the\
  \ Society, how do you spend your time?</b><br> <em>Is there such a thing as not\
  \ working for the Society? It’s been such a part of my life for the past 15 years.\
  \ I do like to read, and the Society has a number of tomes I haven’t gotten to yet.\
  \ I also like to putter in the kitchen, something moving to the Open Road Lodge\
  \ allows more freedom to do. The cooks of the Grand Lodge did not approve when I\
  \ tried to intrude on their domain, so I retreated quickly. Though they did provide\
  \ some tasty pastries as consolation for my defeat.</em></p> \n       <p><b>What\
  \ is your favorite Golarion vacation spot?</b><br> <em>Magnimar. I spent several\
  \ months there some years back, aiding the Venture-Captains Heidmarch. The city\
  \ displays such beauty and the mysteries left behind by the Runelords. I could spend\
  \ years diving into the history of it all and not scratch the surface. Plus the\
  \ weather is more temperate. I do enjoy Osirian history, but it can get a bit hot\
  \ in Sothis. </em></p> \n       <p><b>What is your favorite delicacy?</b><br> <em>Rolled\
  \ cinnamon cakes with just a touch of sweet drizzle on the top. While plain is good,\
  \ I prefer mine filled with chopped bits of apple or raisins. A roll and a cup of\
  \ rich black tea is the perfect way to start a morning. During my travels, I’ve\
  \ been seeking out regional variations. Some countries swap out the cinnamon for\
  \ a spice mix of clove, nutmeg, cinnamon, ginger, and allspice, others make the\
  \ cinnamon into a paste before smearing it in the bread. I heard that Vudrans make\
  \ a similar dish with chili as a component, but I’ve not tried it yet.</em></p>\
  \ \n       <p><b>What’s your favorite place in the Lodge of the Open Road?</b><br>\
  \ <em>The Gardens, particularly near the roses and floral arches. The Lodge is lush\
  \ and green, a perfect idyll, manifested by Gregaro from the fabric of the demiplane.\
  \ I enjoy it when he will join me, as he is a window into the Society, our past,\
  \ and what we can learn to lead into the future. He has so many stories, and I’\
  m appreciative he shares them with me.</em></p> \n       <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
