  \ Oz 2017, There and Back Again</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Thursday, November 9,\
  \ 2017</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\"\
  >In October 2017, I travelled to New Zealand to take part in PaizoCon Oz 2017. My\
  \ first opportunity to attend PaizoCon Oz, the prospect filled me with lots of excitement\
  \ and a bit of trepidation. I hadn't journeyed to the Pacific in almost ten years.\
  \ It is a long plane flight, involves crossing the International Date Line, and\
  \ meant visiting a country I was unfamiliar with outside of movies. But the lure\
  \ of meeting a large group of hitherto unknown Society members, gauging their interest\
  \ in our newest organized play program, Starfinder Society, and playing a game in\
  \ the Green Dragon Inn at Hobbiton outweighed my trepidation and so I made my way\
  \ across the Pacific Ocean.</p> \n    <p>The trip over did nothing to allay my concerns.\
  \ My first flight was delayed on the tarmac to the point many of us on the plane\
  \ thought we would miss the outbound flight from Los Angeles Airport (LAX) to Sydney.\
  \ We got to LAX only to find the issues that had caused the first delay also delayed\
  \ the Sydney flight. After waiting several hours, we boarded, but then had a medical\
  \ emergency that delayed us further. Luckily I had left four hours between landing\
  \ in Sydney and my hop to Auckland, so there wasn't stress about missing the final\
  \ leg of my journey. At last, I boarded my final flight and landed in Auckland,\
  \ New Zealand, at the northern tip of the North Island. Grabbing my rental vehicle,\
  \ I set out for Matamata and Hobbiton.</p> \n    <p>My first impression of the island\
  \ nation was its beauty. As I drove through rolling green hills and saw the flocks\
  \ of sheep, broken now and then by a few houses, I pondered the unsettled nature\
  \ of the country. There are people in New Zealand, but not like there are in Seattle.\
  \ Here, we are packed in, with our green spaces protected by government mandate,\
  \ zealously guarded by city councils and state governments. There, while I'm sure\
  \ the government is making sure the hills remain open, it gives a sense of being\
  \ unsettled, untamed land. Beautiful, but awkward when you haven't eaten in several\
  \ hours and cannot find anything open. It turned dark as I made it to Matamata,\
  \ found an open fast food restaurant, and made my way to the B&amp;B on the outskirts\
  \ of town that I was to call home for the next 5 days.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderSociety/20171109-Matamata_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Morning dawned with chirping birds, lowing cattle, baaing\
  \ sheep, and the smell of coffee. Breakfast entailed toast, cereal, and the freshest\
  \ kiwi I've ever eaten. I reunited with a pair of UK players as well as Seattle\
  \ VC Louis and his family. We spent the morning driving to the coast and dipping\
  \ our feet in the Pacific Ocean. The views were breathtaking and I put my feet in\
  \ the water, expecting warm water, until I remembered New Zealand was just finishing\
  \ winter and heading into spring. I quickly removed myself from the chilly surf\
  \ and contented myself with gathering a small handful of seashells for my collection.</p>\

  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>After a yummy lunch of lamb kebab, we returned to Matamata\
  \ and headed to the convention site, the local club. Matamata Club is a large complex\
  \ housing a restaurant, pool tables, bowling greens, and meeting rooms of various\
  \ sizes and shapes. The New Zealand Venture-Captains, Glen Irving and Paul Trani,\
  \ previously secured use of all the meeting space. In addition, they worked with\
  \ the site on an event menu; ensuring food would be delivered to starving gamers\
  \ most hours of the convention. The bar stocked a variety of drinks to keep us from\
  \ getting parched. Their attention to detail regarding site and food extended to\
  \ every aspect of the convention. There were GM boxes on the tables, with maps,\
  \ pens, Welcome boons, dice towers, and chocolate. A resources table included pregenerated\
  \ characters, pawns and bases, as well as some of the more commonly used forms.\
  \ The HQ table was laden with Taniwas (New Zealand dragons) of all colors, bags\
  \ of dice, participant goody bags, and paperwork. Stalwart volunteers staffed the\
  \ table all weekend, answering questions and keeping things running smoothly. VCs\
  \ Glen and Paul have a most excellent group of people working with them on all the\
  \ organizational aspects of the convention.</p> \n    <p>Thursday afternoon was\
  \ Slot 0 games, as people travelled in from New Zealand, Australia, the US, and\
  \ the UK. I found my table and set up for a run of <a href=\"/products/btpy9u7x?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Quest-Into-the-Unknown\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society Quest: Into the Unknown</em></a>. Four hours later, we had\
  \ delved onto a mystery planet, shot some goblins in space, and returned safely\
  \ to Absalom Station. There was lots of laughing, much \"pew pewing\" and an overall\
  \ enjoyable time.</p> \n    <p>Friday morning kicked off smoothly and we had three\
  \ blocks of games. That afternoon, I ran another game, this time a retired Pathfinder\
  \ Society scenario, and then played <a href=\"/products/btpy9s15?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-899-The-Solstice-Scar-Version-A\"\
  ><em> Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-99: The Solstice Scar—Version A</em></a>.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>I love watching the multi-table interactive specials in action, seeing\
  \ how people decide to tackle the obstacles and what choices they make to move the\
  \ storyline along.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderSociety/20171109-SolsticeScar.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderSociety/20171109-SolsticeScar_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Saturday started with running another scenario, then\
  \ participating in Writing for Paizo workshop with Legendary Games owner Jason Nelson\
  \ and freelancer/RPG Superstar Matt Goodall. Of course, everyone was waiting for\
  \ the big event on Saturday—the trip to Hobbiton and the chance to play Pathfinder\
  \ in the Green Dragon Inn. The visit lived up to all expectations. Driving through\
  \ more sheep laden hills, I imagined myself in Middle Earth, getting ready for Bilbo's\
  \ 111th birthday part. I've been a fan of the Lord of the Rings books and movies\
  \ for so long, and watched/read so much back matter for them, that the journey to\
  \ Hobbiton took on almost a pilgrimage type quality.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderSociety/20171109-Hobbiton.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderSociety/20171109-Hobbiton_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Our guide mentioned that almost 33% of visitors hadn't\
  \ read the books or seen the movie. They tour the set because a friend or family\
  \ member told them they should. Then I remembered the movies are over 10 years old\
  \ and the books written in very formal English and realized that, despite the growing\
  \ popularity of what we refer to as \"geek/nerd culture\", there are people out\
  \ there that haven't been exposed to the awesomeness that is LotR.</p> \n    <p>We\
  \ spent over an hour walking the set. I started at the front of the pack, but soon\
  \ lagged behind, taking photos. My poor phone battery. I ran through it once, hooked\
  \ up a battery pack and then ran through it. The level of detail in the hobbit houses\
  \ was superb. At each one, there were items and decorations that gave insight into\
  \ who lived there and their occupation. Coming down the hill from Bag End, we gathered\
  \ on the party green. There our guide noted that we needed to get into a festive\
  \ mood. He would sing the Green Dragon Inn song ala Peregrine Took. We were to dance\
  \ along and he would not stop singing until we all were dancing. I think he thought\
  \ it would take longer to get us moving, but as you can see <a href=\"https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipN6EV74RttwSyRa1GEkpwo_RG-Xtv3Sdhu7-fXUoEyeYQZhg31efji7ZF2peWB0hQ/photo/AF1QipNu1qa-eXm-e6SWyhZ-M592r9Kc3q3489-N1Ar6?key=RE5rc0JhbHQyNDMtc3JOcV92cVM5YmxHNC1uc1FR\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">in this video</a> we all were in a festive mood!</p> \n    <p>Once\
  \ done with dancing, we headed over the bridge and into the inn, where we were greeted\
  \ by mugs (not pints, you have to go to Bree for those) of ginger beer, cider, or\
  \ ale. To accompany the drinks, we had a hobbit's feast. The sense of camaraderie\
  \ and friendship in the inn made the food taste even better. I really enjoyed meeting\
  \ new people and getting a chance to socialize away from the gaming table.</p> \n\
  \    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderSociety/20171109-HobbitFeast.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>After dinner, the staff cleared the crockery and we set\
  \ up to run <a href=\"/products/btpy9tld?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-900-Assault-on-Absalom\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #9-00: Assault on Absalom</em></a>. I played at\
  \ one of the high tier tables. Our GM, VC Guy Martell, kept us on point so well\
  \ that we finished combats and at one point had time to stand, stretch, and use\
  \ the loo. We intrigued our guides so much talking about the event during the tour\
  \ that they joined in and played their first ever games. Will have to check in and\
  \ see if they are continuing their Pathfinder journey.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Despite the late night Saturday, we rose early Sunday\
  \ to start another full day of Society play. Once again I ran one, played one. I\
  \ can now claim two GM credits as a Starfinder GM. Think I need to get a move on,\
  \ if I'm ever going to reach 1 Nova. My last game was one of the new Season 9 adventures.\
  \ We went really off the rails and made what should have been a brief social encounter\
  \ the highlight of the scenario. Thanks to my fellow players and the GM for some\
  \ fantastic roleplay and an enjoyable end to PaizoCon Oz.</p> \n    <p>After the\
  \ convention, I took two days and saw more of the island. I drove by Mt. Doom, on\
  \ my way to Wellington, where I visited the WETA exhibits, stood on the rocky shores\
  \ of the southern tip of the island, and strolled through an 19th century graveyard.\
  \ Unfortunately, the trip had to end, so I had another drive up the island to Auckland,\
  \ through more of the rolling hills and green pastures. The scenery amazed me in\
  \ how there are clear delineations between each type of landscape and you go from\
  \ one to another in a blink of an eye.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n \

  \ Glen Irving and Paul Trani for taking the lead on the convention, to their team\
  \ that made it happen, to the GMs that gave up their time to run games, and to the\
  \ players for traveling to the site and participating in the games. Without any\
  \ of the above, this event would not have been successful. I, and Paizo, appreciate\
  \ the energy and effort you expend on behalf of the organized play community.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>I highly, HIGHLY, recommend putting PaizoCon Oz on your travel schedule.\
  \ Its moderate size gives a full slate of offerings while keeping the community\
  \ feel. A little bird mentioned next year's PaizoCon Oz may be in Brisbane, Australia,\
  \ though the collective Venture-Officers of Australia and New Zealand are still\
  \ discussing the issues and will announce more in the upcoming months.</p> \n  \
  \  <p>Meanwhile, back in North America, the team is deep into planning Pathfinder\
  \ Society RPG Season 10, Starfinder Society Season 2, and Pathfinder Society ACG\
  \ Season 5, as well as maintaining operations on Seasons 9/1/4 and working on program\
  \ updates. I cannot wait to share some details with you in a future blog!</p> \n\
  \    <p>Until next time—Explore, Report, Cooperate!</p> \n    <p>Tonya Woldridge<br>\
