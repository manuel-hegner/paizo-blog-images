  \ Just Keeps Coming</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, October 28, 2008</p> \n\
  \   <p> Paizo is a very busy place. For any given month we're publishing six or\
  \ more books, plus novels, item cards, and maps. I feel like those vaudeville acts\
  \ where the guy's spinning plates on top of poles, keeping them all balanced. </p>\
  \ \n   <p>I love it. I love being busy—I'd rather be busy than bored. Since I started\
  \ at Paizo in July, I've developed at least 12 different products. And that doesn't\
  \ count planning for future products (like the <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG\">Pathfinder\
  \ RPG</a>) or giving feedback on other peoples' projects. Sure, sometimes we get\
  \ behind, but I often say, \"Nothing makes a person more productive than the last\
  \ minute,\" and we buckle down and work that much faster. </p> \n   <p>This very\
  \ day I'm helping finish up <i><a href=\"/store/v5748btpy81x9\">Osirion, Land of\
  \ Pharaohs</a></i> and <a href=\"http://paizo.com/pathfinder/pathfinderChronicles/v5748btpy81tv\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Chronicles Guide to Absalom</i></a>, doing back cover copy for an\
  \ as-yet-unannounced surprise, starting a development pass on <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy84b9\"\
  ><i>Dragons Revisited</i></a>, doing a quick development pass on Pathfinder Society\
  \ scenario #7, doing a pagination for <i><a href=\"/store/v5748btpy81qp\">Clash\
  \ of the Kingslayers</a></i>, writing an art order for <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy84ba\"\
  ><i>Guide to Katapesh</i></a>, and reviewing sketches for the next item cards set.\
  \ Phew! It's fast-paced and crazy, but it is very satisfying when the books arrive\
  \ in the warehouse and I know that our team worked really hard to get them done.\
  \ And this is a fairly typical day. I checked our schedule page for October and\
  \ of this month's releases, I developed or helped develop four of them and wrote\
  \ another. You may think that working for a game company is nothing but sitting\
  \ around, rolling dice, and eating pizza, but it's actually a lot of intense crunch-time\
  \ labor. </p> \n   <p>One of the editors of <i>Dragon</i> back in the '80s or '90s\
  \ wrote an editorial about the monthly magazine business, and how you're always\
  \ counting down toward the issue's deadline. The first day of working on a magazine\
  \ is Deadline Minus 30, the next is Deadline Minus 29, and so on. And the day after\
  \ you ship the book isn't Deadline Plus One—it's Deadline Minus 30 for the <i>next</i>\
  \ issue. It never stops! You always have something to work on.</p> \n   <p>Speaking\
  \ of which, I have three more things I need to finish before the end of the day.\
  \ Time for some caffeine fuel! And maybe some delicious pie....</p> \n   <p> Sean\
  \ K Reynolds<br> <i>Developer</i></p> \n  </blockquote> <!-- tags: Guide to Katapesh,\
