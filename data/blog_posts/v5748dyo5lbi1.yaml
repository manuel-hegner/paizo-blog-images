  \ new art?</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Thursday, October 7, 2010</p> \n    <p>It's\
  \ no secret that the most popular entries in this blog are art previews, and we\
  \ love showing off the beautiful work of all the great artists who have created\
  \ the visual look and feel of Golarion and the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. But\
  \ all the attention on art has brought to our attention the bargaining power we\
  \ hold as your art peddlers.</p> \n    <p>Players in the Pathfinder Society Organized\
  \ Play campaign have probably noticed that Season 2 has centered around the mysterious\
  \ Shadow Lodge, and we plan to carry this theme through to the end of the year.\
  \ We're also planning an even more intricate metaplot for Season 3, in which PCs'\
  \ successes, failures, and faction prestige will have a direct impact on future\
  \ scenarios and world canon as a whole. But this means that we need to see a much\
  \ higher rate of reporting from GMs and event coordinators.</p> \n    <p>With the\
  \ <a href=\"/paizo/news/v5748eaic9nci\">announcement</a> this week of our first\
  \ 13 PFS regional coordinators (whom we're calling Venture-Captains, naturally)\
  \ it's now even easier for PFS participants to get event support and organizational\
  \ assistance near their local game store or convention, but there are surely uncounted\
  \ sessions that have gone unreported in the past few years. We need to see these\
  \ numbers, as they'll allow us to focus resources toward where you play, as well\
  \ as plan for the future of the Society, as we see what scenarios are played most\
  \ often, and which factions have the most players and average prestige.</p> \n \
  \   <p>So! If we see 600 newly reported PFS sessions in the month of October, I'll\
  \ preview some exclusive new art from the upcoming <i><a href=\"/pathfinder/campaignSetting/v5748btpy8dd7\"\
  >World Guide: The Inner Sea</a></i>. We will be previewing the book when its release\
  \ date approaches, but my gut tells me you want to see some art sooner rather than\
  \ later. So get out there and start a PFS group for your friends or at your local\
  \ game store! Report that session you ran over the summer that you haven't yet.\
  \ Show us you want the art <i>now</i>!</p> \n    <p>P.S. (from Hyrum) If you report\
  \ over 700 tables, we'll spoil a piece of art James Jacobs specifically said not\
  \ to reveal.</p> \n    <p>Mark Moreland <br>Developer</p> \n   </blockquote> <!--\
