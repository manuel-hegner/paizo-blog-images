  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Monday, November 15, 2010</p> \n   <p>Coming to work at\
  \ Paizo is like coming home. When I first started working at Wizards of the Coast\
  \ I worked with Erik, had regular chats with Jason, and Lisa and Sean were always\
  \ nearby, stalking the shadows, waiting to strike.</p> \n   <p>Those were good times\
  \ and I'm looking forward to revive them in my new digs. I'm excited about doing\
  \ more work on the Pathfinder RPG. Throughout the development of 4e I watched its\
  \ rise with keen interest. As a subscriber, I was already a Paizo fanboy. I wanted\
  \ to see the solutions that Paizo would put forward, because I love RPGs and I know\
  \ there is never a single solution to a design challenge. I also wanted to see my\
  \ friends succeed.</p>\n   <p> </p>\n   <p>Paizo's solutions were stellar and so\
  \ it was no surprise that the successes have been triumphant.</p>\n   <p> </p>\n\
  \   <p> When I left Wizards and was invited to work on the <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide</i></a> as a freelancer, I jumped at\
  \ the chance. When Paizo invited me to join their staff, I eagerly leaped again.\
  \ Now amidst many old friends and quite a few new ones, I look forward to making\
  \ sure that you, the Pathfinder player, get the game you deserve with each and every\
  \ product: a game that's exciting, evocative, and fun. So my job is to make sure\
  \ you at least get what you're accustomed to and more. It's going to be a fantastic\
  \ challenge.</p>\n   <p> </p>\n   <p>Now let's confirm some crits!</p>\n   <p> </p>\n\
