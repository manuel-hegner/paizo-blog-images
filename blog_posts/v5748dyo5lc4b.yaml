  \ Society Organized Play, Part VI: Establish Order, No Matter the Costs</h1> \n\

  \ border=\"0\" align=\"right\"></a> \n   <p><i>The proud empire of Cheliax once\
  \ spread across two continents, but fell to diabolical rule after 30 years of civil\
  \ war following Aroden's death. Chelaxians believe their nation superior to the\
  \ others in the Inner Sea region, and won't let something as simple as the death\
  \ of their patron god prevent them from attaining their prophesied age of glory.\
  \ The ruling House Thrune and its allies rose to power amid chaos, and established\
  \ order with the help of the armies of Hell; they maintain control decades later\
  \ with the same regimented organization of their infernal minions. Though Cheliax\
  \ already controls the Arch of Aroden, and thus the western entrance to the Inner\
  \ Sea, Queen Abrogail II's strategists know that control of Absalom is vital if\
  \ Cheliax hopes to establish order throughout the region. They believe that victory\
  \ is well within their grasp, and that it will come on the backs of the weak.</i></p>\
  \ \n   <p>We led off the parade of factions two weeks ago with a look at Andoran,\
  \ which is far and away the most popular faction. Though Andoran's neighbor geographically\
  \ (and alphabetically in the list of ten factions), Cheliax couldn't be more different\
  \ than its freedom-fighting rivals. Not only are the lawful-evil tendencies of the\
  \ organization at direct odds with the chaotic good spirit of liberty, but the faction\
  \ has also been the least popular in terms of active members in all three seasons\
  \ of Pathfinder Society Organized Play.</p> \n   <p>It doesn't take a genius to\
  \ figure out why, though. These are the \"bad guys\" of the Pathfinder Society campaign.\
  \ They're the ones who send players on missions to spread the influence of Hell\
  \ and the Infernal armies of the House of Thrune. If there's one thing we can learn\
  \ from the trend in membership between the Andoran and Cheliax factions, it's that\
  \ players want to be heroes!</p> \n   <p>So what happens to Cheliax going forward?\
  \ So far, nothing, though faction leader Paracountess Zarta Dralneen's flagging\
  \ leadership has certainly caught the eye of her superiors. It'd really be a shame\
  \ for her to be punished personally for the fact that she represents the \"bad guy\
  \ faction.\" I know I'd personally hate to see her replaced, since I love reading\
  \ her innuendo-drenched faction missives. I just hope Queen Abrogail and her lackeys\
  \ are as amused by her suggestive tone and rampant hedonism as most Cheliax faction\
  \ players are.</p> \n   <p>Luckily, we won't be gauging a faction's success on its\
  \ membership numbers next season, but rather the rate at which active members succeed\
  \ at faction missions. And while there are many disparaging things the champions\
  \ of good can say about Cheliax, that they aren't dedicated isn't one of them. Then\
  \ again, we've already said there will be another \"good guy\" faction next year.\
  \ What would happen to Cheliax's resolve if we were to add another \"bad guy\" to\
  \ keep things even? Will newly added prestige awards allowing Cheliax faction PCs\
  \ of all classes to advance in the ranks of the Hellknights be enough to keep the\
  \ already low number of faithful from jumping ship? Only time (and maybe some prayers\
  \ to Asmodeus) will tell.</p> \n   <p>Check back next Monday for a look at the new\
  \ scenarios and special events we'll be offering at Gen Con to celebrate the launch\
  \ of Season 3!</p> \n   <p>Mark Moreland <br>Developer</p> \n  </blockquote> <!--\
