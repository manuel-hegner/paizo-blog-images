  \ \n    <p class=\"date\">Wednesday, February 22, 2012</p> \n    <p>by Hugh Matthews</p>\
  \ \n    <p><i>In <a href=\"/products/btpy8qih\"></a></i><a href=\"/products/btpy8qih\"\
  >Song of the Serpent<i></i></a><i>, veteran thief Krunzle the Quick gets caught\
  \ burgling the house of a powerful Kalistocrat of Druma, and in exchange for his\
  \ life agrees to attempt a dangerous mission to recover the merchant's runaway daughter.\
  \ Such things are not so easily done, however, and in this chapter Krunzle has just\
  \ been captured by the thugs in charge of a thriving mining town...</i></p> \n \
  \   <h2>Chapter Four: A Promising Young Troll</h2> \n    <p>When he awoke this time,\
  \ he was at least unbound. He was lying on his back on a wooden floor in a dark\
  \ place. But he knew he was not alone from the hubbub of voices and motion around\
  \ him. Something startling had happened—no, frightening, he thought as his senses\
  \ fully reassembled themselves and reported for duty—and a crowd of people were\
  \ reacting to it by putting as much distance between themselves and the something\
  \ as their circumstances allowed.</p> \n    <p>But their circumstances were not\
  \ liberal; the mob had not gone far away, though the panicky cries and curses suggested\
  \ they would have liked to. Krunzle also suspected that, given the chance, the unseen\
  \ melee of forms struggling against each other in the darkness would have welcomed\
  \ the opportunity to bathe—surely, nobody wanted to reek of filth, sweat, rotten\
  \ meat, and untreated sores. And over it, a strong stink of charred meat.</p> \n\
  \    <p>His head ached, but at least it was clear. He sat up, and as he did so he\
  \ heard from behind him the tramping of hard-soled boots on planks, accompanied\
  \ by a faint light that grew stronger. He turned his head and, seeing vertical stripes\
  \ of light, realized that they were gaps between the timbers of a heavy door. Someone\
  \ was approaching the other side, carrying a light.</p> \n    <p>A rattle of iron\
  \ keys, then the turning of an unoiled lock, and now the door was pushed in. A big\
  \ man armed with a club bent to peer under the low lintel of the doorway, extending\
  \ the oil lamp into the room. \"What's all the ruckus?\" he said.</p> \n    <p>He\
  \ didn't seem to have directed the question at Krunzle, and the thief used the presence\
  \ of the light to look about him. He was sitting on the floor of a large room, its\
  \ walls made of squared-off logs. The room contained three or four score men—ragged,\
  \ filthy, scrofulous-looking men—who were crowded in a group against the far wall,\
  \ their eyes large in the lamplight.</p> \n    <p>The eyes were frightened and focused\
  \ on Krunzle—except he now saw that the mob's collective gaze kept going to something\
  \ on the floor between him and them. Something man-sized and man-shaped that, when\
  \ the fellow with the lamp came into the room, casting more illumination on the\
  \ scene, was revealed to be a man. Or at least most of one. And what was left of\
  \ him was dead.</p> \n    <p>The man with the club stepped past the thief and bent\
  \ to examine the body. Krunzle took the opportunity to rise. He thought about making\
  \ a break through the open door, but decided he was far too wobbly on his feet.\
  \ And for all he knew, in the blackness that seemed to be outside this jail—for\
  \ ragged men, a strong door, and a man with a key and a club all said jail to Krunzle—\
  he'd run straight over the lip of the gorge.</p> \n    <p>The corpse was that of\
  \ a heavily muscled man with a scarred face and no hands or forearms. Above where\
  \ his elbows should have been were charred stumps, still smoking. His eyes were\
  \ wide open, as was his mouth, creating an impression that his final emotion had\
  \ been huge and painful surprise.</p> \n    <p>The jailer made a noise of confirmation,\
  \ straightened, and poked the club gingerly in Krunzle's direction. \"You,\" he\
  \ said, \"back off. Over in that corner, and stay there.\" When the traveler raised\
  \ both hands in a gesture of non-confrontation and did as he was bid, the man with\
  \ the club pointed at a couple of the ragamuffins and said, \"You two, haul this\
  \ out and dump it in Skanderbrog's trough.\"</p> \n    <p>The indicated pair crept\
  \ forward, took the corpse's ankles, and began to drag it toward the door. \"Wait,\"\
  \ said the jailer, then stooped to rifle the body's rags, which Krunzle noted were\
  \ in better condition than any of those worn by the other men in the cell. Having\
  \ found and pocketed a few items, the man with the club said, \"Carry on.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>He remained in the room, eyeing Krunzle warily, until the corpse detail\
  \ returned. Then he pointed the club at the thief again, said, \"No more trouble,\"\
  \ and left, taking the lamp with him.</p> \n    <p>Krunzle heard the key turn in\
  \ the lock again. Before the light went, he had seen rags and sacking on the floor\
  \ near him. He scooped these into a pile, then lay down. Over on the other side\
  \ of the room, he heard stirrings and mutterings and a few curses as the crowd of\
  \ ragged men composed themselves for what remained of the night.</p> \n    <p>None\
  \ of them came too near Krunzle, for which the traveler was grateful. Their stench\
  \ was not to his liking. He raised a hand to carefully waggle his jaw, poked with\
  \ his tongue at the loosened tooth, and contemplated the general ache in his skull.\
  \ He had known worse.</p> \n    <p>He needed sleep. Tomorrow would bring more information\
  \ about his predicament, and perhaps some means of improving it. His last thought\
  \ was to wonder again what Skanderbrog was.</p> \n    <center>\n     <p>∗ ∗ ∗</p>\n\
  \    </center> \n    <p>Krunzle, along with the other slaves, was roused at dawn\
  \ by the clanging of an iron bar on an iron triangle hung outside the strongroom.\
  \ The door was flung open by another man with a club, and the slaves roused themselves\
  \ from where they had slept on the floor and rushed outside. The thief rose and\
  \ followed.</p> \n    <p>He found himself on a broad platform made of planks, close\
  \ to the edge of the gorge. The ragged men were clustered around a big cauldron\
  \ near the door to the barracks. They'd taken rough wooden bowls and were dipping\
  \ them into the big pot and slurping the contents. More tough-looking men with cudgels—\
  some of them had coiled whips at their belts—stood around, some of them telling\
  \ the ragged men to hurry up and finish.</p> \n    <p>Krunzle went to the pile of\
  \ bowls, found one that was not too encrusted with dried remnants of previous meals,\
  \ and moved toward the cauldron. He could not help but notice that those in his\
  \ path—or even well wide of it—moved out of his way. Even the bruisers seemed chary\
  \ of coming too close to him.</p> \n    <p>He dipped the bowl into the stuff in\
  \ the pot—some kind of pasty gruel afloat with chunks of spoiled vegetables—and\
  \ brought it to his lips. It tasted like pig swill, the kind given to swine who\
  \ were not highly prized by their owner. But he reasoned that the day was not likely\
  \ to offer better nourishment, and he remembered someone saying last night that\
  \ he would be \"moving baskets of ore.\" That was not work to be undertaken on an\
  \ empty stomach.</p> \n    <p>He saw the red-bearded Ulfen who had beaten him at\
  \ Wartnose's behest come down from the town and speak a word with a big-shouldered\
  \ guard who looked to be in charge. The thief recognized this one too: he had been\
  \ one of the men who had come to take him from Room Thirteen. Now Redbeard went\
  \ back the way he had come and the head guard cast his gaze over the workers, until\
  \ he found the one he was looking for. \"Raimeau!\" he called. \"You show the new\
  \ man what to do!\"</p> \n    <p>A gangling young man with long locks of prematurely\
  \ gray hair got up from where he'd been eating, drained the final few drops of gruel\
  \ from his bowl, then wiped its wet inner side with a finger to lick off the absolutely\
  \ last remnants. He tossed the bowl onto the heap of others and came very slowly\
  \ toward the traveler, his hands extended in a gesture that said he hoped for no\
  \ trouble.</p> \n    <p>Krunzle noticed that Raimeau's eyes went from his to the\
  \ thing around his neck and back again. The traveler put the facts together. To\
  \ the young man he said, \"You have no need to worry about this,\"—he moved a hand\
  \ to indicate Chirk—\"as long as you leave it alone.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Have no fear,\"\
  \ said the other. \"Seeing what happened to Chenax was instruction enough for me.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Chenax was the man with no hands?\"</p> \n    <p>\"He was, though\
  \ he had a very hard pair of fists before he met you, and had no qualms about using\
  \ them.\"</p> \n    <p>At that moment, a whistle blew and the slaves moved toward\
  \ the edge of the platform. \"Work?\" said the thief.</p> \n    <p>\"Work,\" said\
  \ Raimeau. \"We'll be hauling baskets of ore from the face up to the crusher. Watch\
  \ where you put your feet, because there are no railings on the ledge or the scaffolding.\
  \ One misstep, and you'll be joining Skanderbrog for dinner. Like Chenax is about\
  \ to do for breakfast.\"</p> \n    <p>The thief focused on the immediate. \"Are\
  \ Chenax's shoes still available?\" He indicated his stockinged feet. \"Mining is\
  \ no work for the unshod.\"</p> \n    <p>\"They will be if Skanderbrog hasn't had\
  \ breakfast yet. He usually doesn't bother to peel his fruit.\"</p> \n    <center>\n\

  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n     <br> \"So this is a Skanderbrog.\"\n    </div> \n    <p>Skanderbrog,\
  \ it turned out, was a name—a name that had been given to a juvenile male troll\
  \ by his mother, who after nursing him through childhood and teaching him the rudiments\
  \ of trollery, had handed young Skanderbrog the forequarter of a deer and sent him\
  \ down from the mountains to see if he could establish a territory for himself and\
  \ get on with life. But Skanderbrog had been unable to find a niche that was not\
  \ already occupied by larger and more experienced trolls. Starving, he had come\
  \ down to forage on the outskirts of Ulm's Delve. After eating a couple of unsuccessful\
  \ gold-panners—they made poor meals, being half-starved themselves, living off leaves\
  \ and roots while striving for the elusive gleam in the pan—he had been trapped\
  \ in a pit that Wartnose's mage had caused to be dug and lined with charms.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The man with the wart on his nose was, as the thief might have expected,\
  \ the same Boss Ulm by whose order Ulm's Delve barred \"thieves, filchers, bun-passers,\
  \ vagrants, and holy-fakers.\" The skeletally thin wizard he employed was Mordach\
  \ the Prudent, and the red-bearded Ulfen was Brundelaf, the outfit's chief enforcer.\
  \ He even knew the name of the brawler who had clipped him: Little Fost, he was\
  \ called—apparently there was a larger version somewhere in the world. The thief\
  \ thought he would as lief as not be spared the experience of making Big Fost's\
  \ acquaintance.</p> \n    <p>Raimeau was both the knowledgeable type and the sort\
  \ who liked to tell what he knew. As they descended the scaffolding then stepped\
  \ off the trestle-work to where a broad ledge had been cut in the rock face, he\
  \ filled Krunzle in on the history of Ulm's Delve. By the time they had wrested\
  \ a pair of sturdy shoes from the feet of dead, handless Chenax, laid in a broad\
  \ wooden trough at one end of the ledge, near a cave sealed behind a grillwork of\
  \ black metal, the thief was well briefed.</p> \n    <p>Boss Ulm had established\
  \ himself quite solidly here in the Rumples, as this stretch of hilly country was\
  \ called. Hearing of the gold strike and the rush of goldbugs into the region, he\
  \ had come with his henchmen to establish the first saloon, brothel, and hardware\
  \ emporium—in tents at first, though a sawmill was one of his earliest accomplishments,\
  \ so that he could put up more enduring structures.</p> \n    <p>Once the instant\
  \ town was booming, and Brundelaf and Little Fost and the others had eliminated\
  \ any doubts as to who was in charge, Ulm had begun to think larger thoughts. He\
  \ had hired Mordach the Prudent and set him the task of locating the source of the\
  \ alluvial gold that had the prospectors lining the river's banks, panning and sluicing.\
  \ The mage had cast his runesticks and questioned a number of subterranean beings\
  \ he managed to summon and bind. Finally, he had marked a spot halfway up the south\
  \ side of Starkriven Gorge, as the sheer canyon upriver from the town was called.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Ulm had established a claim to the gorge by the simple expedient of sending\
  \ his bullyboys to throw out the handful of gold-hunters who were trying to work\
  \ the gravel beneath the swift-running water at its bottom. He then moved the infant\
  \ town to the edge of the chasm and began to develop a mine.</p> \n    <p>Mines\
  \ require miners. These Ulm acquired by the simplest and least costly of measures:\
  \ he promulgated several ordinances, signed by himself as de facto Reeve of Ulm's\
  \ Delve. He knew that gold camps attract more than goldbugs; they attract several\
  \ categories of persons who are skilled in separating prospectors from their pokes\
  \ of dust and the occasional nugget. Boss Ulm made many of these activities illegal—\
  the penalty for engaging in such banned enterprises was to be sentenced to an indefinite\
  \ span of labor in the mine or the sawmill. He soon had a sizable, though resentful,\
  \ work force.</p> \n    <p>Ulm had them build a trestle-work of timbers from the\
  \ gorge's bottom to its top, and cut a wide ledge at the level where the seam of\
  \ gold within the rock came closest to the rock face. Some of his enslaved card\
  \ sharps, cutpurses, badger-gamers, and sandbaggers were set to hacking their way\
  \ through to the gold, while others carried baskets of split rock to the surface,\
  \ piling up the ore where Ulm had put more of his prisoners—there seemed to be an\
  \ unending supply—to building him a crushing mill.</p> \n    <p>In the early days,\
  \ the work had gone slowly, but the pace speeded up considerably when Mordach was\
  \ able to bring Skanderbrog—in massive leg fetters of hammered iron—into the picture.\
  \ Accommodating the troll required extra shoring up of the scaffolding, the cutting\
  \ into the rock of a cell barred with a thick grill of charmed iron—the cell outside\
  \ which Chenax waited to make his final contribution to Boss Ulm's wealth—and the\
  \ manufacture of a huge hammer and chisel scaled to the young monster's size. But\
  \ the investment was worth it. After a couple of the least-motivated workers were\
  \ delegated to become troll-fodder, in full view of the rest of the work force,\
  \ the mine's productivity increased severalfold.</p> \n    <p>Krunzle was on the\
  \ ledge with Raimeau, trying on the dead man's shoes—they almost fit—when the whistle\
  \ blew again. \"We should leave here,\" the other man said. \"Skanderbrog's coming\
  \ out.\" As he spoke, a creak of metal on metal announced that the iron grillwork\
  \ covering the opening at the end of the ledge was being winched upward on unseen\
  \ cables. The thief needed no more encouragement but went quickly back the way they\
  \ had come.</p> \n    <p>The young troll emerged into the morning light, blinking.\
  \ Krunzle could see that he was not full grown: his undertusks thrust up no more\
  \ than a few inches and he was barely twice the thief's height, even allowing for\
  \ the stooped, bent-kneed stance that was common to his species. But his months\
  \ of enslavement to Boss Ulm, each day spent swinging a hammer with a head as big\
  \ as a man's torso to drive a long, thick chisel into resisting rock, had put even\
  \ more muscle onto Skanderbrog's arms and shoulders than most mature trolls ever\
  \ achieved. Trolls were generally averse to hard labor, preferring to make their\
  \ livings by leaping from concealment onto passersby of whatever species. After\
  \ overwhelming their prey with sudden, massive violence, they would sit down immediately\
  \ to eat them raw. Trolls actually preferred cooked food, but most were too lazy\
  \ to bother gathering fuel and going through the process of kindling a fire.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Skanderbrog's attention was drawn to the trough. He picked up Chenax\
  \ in both his talon-tipped hands and brought his long snout down to sniff the body's\
  \ charred arm-stumps. He clearly found the scent unpleasant, and delicately pulled\
  \ Chenax's upper limbs from their sockets, much like a man twisting the wings off\
  \ a cooked fowl, and threw them into the gorge.</p> \n    <p>The iron entrance to\
  \ his cave closed behind him. He ignored it, and hunkered down on his haunches.\
  \ A single twist of his wrist and Chenax's head popped off in his hand. He tossed\
  \ the morsel into his mouth and Krunzle heard it crunch between the wide molars.\
  \ Skanderbrog chewed, it seemed to the traveler, quite thoughtfully for a troll,\
  \ his gaze moving across the crowd of slaves ranged over the flat and inclined surfaces\
  \ of the scaffolding. He focused most clearly, however, on Mordach the mage, who\
  \ had come down from above, along with a crew of torch-bearing men from Boss Ulm's\
  \ cadre of enforcers. </p> \n    <p>While Skanderbrog made short work of the rest\
  \ of Chenax, spitting out a metal belt buckle before swallowing the last of his\
  \ meal, the men formed a double line of fire across the ledge between the troll\
  \ and any possibility of his escape up or down the trestle-work. Mordach took up\
  \ a position behind the twin rows of lit torches, raised his hands skyward, so that\
  \ his sleeves fell back from his stick-thin arms, and shouted several harsh syllables.\
  \ </p> \n    <p>The troll reacted as if he had experienced a sudden toothache. He\
  \ shook his head, spittle flying from his black lips and prominent bottom tusks,\
  \ and got to his feet. The look he gave the mage and the torchmen would have rendered\
  \ Krunzle in instant need of a toilet, preferably one behind a locked and troll-proof\
  \ door, but the men did not flinch. One or two of them even jeered and made rude\
  \ noises with their tongues and lips.</p> \n    <p>Skanderbrog took only three steps,\
  \ then paused where a sheet of canvas covered something against the gouged rock\
  \ of the cliff face. He bent and threw back the heavy fabric as if it were the lightest\
  \ cloth; beneath were his hammer and chisel. Mordach sent another string of syllables\
  \ his way, and the young troll took up the tools and faced the rock. He set the\
  \ chisel's edge into a crack, drew back the hammer, and slammed it forward. The\
  \ collision gave off an almost musical chink, and a chunk of rock separated from\
  \ the cliff and fell at Skanderbrog's feet. He swiveled, stooped, and bashed the\
  \ hammer against the lump of stone, smashing it into fragments. Then he turned,\
  \ straightened, put the chisel back against the wall, and repeated the process.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The torchmen parted enough for Mordach to step through to the fore. The\
  \ troll eyed him askance but continued to cut rock from the cliff face and reduce\
  \ it to smaller pieces. The mage's arm moved in a sweeping motion aimed at the ledge,\
  \ and a rune carved into the nail of his index finger glowed with a light that made\
  \ Krunzle's eyes ache, even at a distance. A smoking line appeared on the floor\
  \ of the ledge just short of the growing pile of rock fragments. The troll paused\
  \ in his work, sniffed at the air above the line, and growled. Then he went back\
  \ to work.</p> \n    <p>Mordach and the torch-bearers departed, climbing the scaffolding's\
  \ steps back up to the town, though not before the wizard favored Krunzle with a\
  \ considering gaze. When the steps were cleared, the overseers hurried the slaves\
  \ to form two parallel lines from the ledge up to the top of the gorge. Baskets\
  \ were passed down from above until every man had one. The thief and his minder\
  \ were pressed into line, becoming two links in what would become a continuous double\
  \ chain to move baskets up and down the scaffolding. </p> \n    <p>Now a slave with\
  \ a long-handled iron rake stepped up to Skanderbrog's growing pile of broken stone.\
  \ Gingerly, the man extended the tool and pulled some rock across the line, which\
  \ had now ceased to smoke but remained plain on the ledge's surface. As the rake's\
  \ heavy tines grated on the stone, the troll paused in his labors and turned his\
  \ head slightly toward the sound. Immediately, another slave, whose only function\
  \ appeared to be to watch Skanderbrog, hissed a warning. The rake man stepped back.\
  \ But the troll only growled again, then with a grunt, swung the hammer against\
  \ the chisel head. The first man in the basket chain scooped rock into his basket\
  \ then passed it to the slave beside him, who passed it in turn to the next man.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>And so went the morning. For the first hour, Krunzle was in the upward-moving\
  \ chain, taking a loaded basket from his left and passing it to his right. It took\
  \ about half a minute for a basket to be loaded with Skanderbrog's output, so that\
  \ every thirty seconds he had to bear a load for a few moments. At first, it wasn't\
  \ hard, but as the minutes piled up, his shoulders and lower back began to ache,\
  \ and his forearms to cramp. Raimeau was opposite him in the second chain, passing\
  \ empty baskets downward to where the troll kept making fresh material for them\
  \ to shift.</p> \n    <p>After an hour, a whistle blew and the two chains changed\
  \ jobs. Krunzle welcomed the relief. But all too soon, it seemed, the whistle sounded\
  \ again, and he was back to the hard life. By now the sun was well up, and the rock\
  \ face caught and reflected its heat. Sweat ran down the thief's face and chest,\
  \ soaked his shirt to his back, made his eyes sting with its salt. He reminded himself\
  \ that he had sworn never to engage in brute labor—a vow he had seldom broken, and\
  \ then only at the order of a magistrate who could command guardsmen with whips\
  \ and truncheons to enforce their sentences.</p> \n    <p>The whistle blew again,\
  \ and Krunzle was back to passing empty panniers. \"Do we get lunch?\" he said to\
  \ Raimeau, working opposite him.</p> \n    <p>\"More gruel,\" was the answer. The\
  \ man next to Raimeau made a face. \"Sometimes with a cat or a few rats in it.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Krunzle grunted. It was time to find a new occupation. But he was\
  \ surprised at the idea that emerged from the back of his mind—until he realized\
  \ that the thought had not been his, but Chirk's.</p> \n    <p><i>Are you insane?</i>\
  \ he thought back at the snake. <i>Even here I am too close to the troll</i>.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>But the thought formed: after lunch, the snake wanted him to take the\
  \ place of the man with the rake.</p> \n    <p><i>Why?</i> But in a moment, he knew\
  \ the reason. Chirk wanted to have a conversation with Skanderbrog. <i>You are insane</i>,\
  \ Krunzle thought. <i>No one ever benefited from a conversation with a troll, unless\
  \ it was the troll—a little diversion before dinner.</i></p> \n    <p>The word formed\
  \ in his mind: <i>Nonetheless</i>.</p> \n    <p><i>No</i>, returned the thief, <i>and\
  \ that is final</i>.</p> \n    <p>But it wasn't. Chirk showed him pictures: Mordach\
  \ the Prudent dissolving the thief in a vat of acid, then draining it away to retrieve\
  \ the unharmed bronze serpent from among his smoldering bones; Mordach sliding Krunzle\
  \ into a blue-flamed furnace, then raking through the ashes for the again-unharmed\
  \ Chirk; Mordach coating the traveler with a sticky, sweet syrup and staking him\
  \ down between two great anthills, returning later to—</p> \n    <p><i>Enough!</i>\
  \ said Krunzle. <i>He will do one of these things?</i></p> \n    <p>A moment later\
  \ he knew that Mordach was delayed only because he had not yet decided which of\
  \ these methodologies would create a maximum reduction of Krunzle with a minimum\
  \ effect upon the object around his neck. The mage was known, after all, as \"the\
  \ Prudent.\"</p> \n    <center>\n     <p>∗ ∗ ∗</p>\n    </center> \n    <p>Lunch\
  \ was gruel and rotten pumpkin. Krunzle found a few flakes of gray meat in his,\
  \ and swallowed them without comment. The work had given him an appetite as well\
  \ as an acute awareness of several muscle groups that he had always taken for granted.\
  \ He cataloged his aches and pains and swore to himself that Boss Ulm would one\
  \ day render up an accounting for each and every one of them.</p> \n    <p>While\
  \ they were eating, Mordach the Prudent returned and, with the torchmen to shield\
  \ him, renewed the strength of the boundary spell he had cast that morning. Then\
  \ he went back to town, throwing Krunzle a considering gaze as he passed.</p> \n\
  \    <p>The whistle blew and the thief said to Raimeau, \"Come, and quickly.\" They\
  \ descended the rough wooden steps as lightly as could be allowed by Krunzle's ill-fitting\
  \ shoes and the prospect of plunging to a deadly battering on the rocks below. By\
  \ the time the basket lines were reformed, he was standing near the mage's deadline—\
  still visible, though no longer smoldering—with the rake in hand. Raimeau was beside\
  \ him, wearing a look of deep uncertainty when he wasn't casting fearful sideways\
  \ glances at the troll, the monster sitting with his back against the wall, glowering\
  \ at them and the rest of the uncooperative world.</p> \n    <p>The man who had\
  \ used the rake before said, \"Give me that.\" To add emphasis, he scooped up a\
  \ fist-sized rock and cocked his arm.</p> \n    <p>But it seemed to the traveler\
  \ that the man did not have the full conviction that the implied threat required.\
  \ <i>Chirk?</i> he thought.</p> \n    <p>Instead of an answer from the recesses\
  \ of his mind, Krunzle saw the man lower his arm. The chunk of rock rattled among\
  \ others in a basket, and the fellow—and his assistant, though not without a muttered\
  \ threat to Raimeau—joined the basket chain.</p> \n    <p>The gray-haired man was\
  \ regarding the thief with even more trepidation than when they had first met. \"\
  What?\" said Krunzle, turning to where Skanderbrog was levering himself to his splay-toed\
  \ feet and taking up his tools again.</p> \n    <p>\"You don't know?\" said Raimeau,\
  \ keeping his voice low.</p> \n    <p>\"Assume I don't.\" Krunzle raked a pile of\
  \ rock toward the man whose job it was to fill the baskets.</p> \n    <p>\"The snake,\"\
  \ his partner whispered. \"It glowed, kind of purple, but when you look at it too\
  \ long black spots start floating before your eyes. It did that when Chenax tried\
  \ to take it.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Oh, that,\" said Krunzle, \"of course. I'm familiar\
  \ with the effect.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Get to work!\" The shout came from above, where\
  \ one of Ulm's bullyboys was pushing his way down the steps between the lines of\
  \ basketmen, and reaching for a whip coiled at his belt. Krunzle turned and began\
  \ to rake rock.</p> \n    <p>Skanderbrog hacked at the cliff face as if it were\
  \ his direst enemy. The muscles of his shoulders and arms bulged and flexed as he\
  \ swung the hammer that seemed to weigh no more than a switch of willow. Raimeau\
  \ watched the troll closely, speaking a warning whenever the creature gave over\
  \ attacking the wall of rock and turned to smash the boulders at his feet into pebbles.\
  \ For that phase of the operations, the thief and his helper stood well back.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Even so, a flying shard opened Krunzle's cheek. He felt the sting, then\
  \ a warm trickle making its way down through the dust on his face. The troll looked\
  \ up from his work, snuffling, his nostrils dilated. He stared at Krunzle, and for\
  \ a few seconds the traveler knew what it was to be a rabbit undergoing inspection\
  \ by a fox. Though he was well beyond the mage's line, still he took a step backward.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>As he did so, words formed in the back of his mind. He pushed them back\
  \ where they had come from, saying, <i>I don't think so. One of my longstanding\
  \ rules is not to draw the attention of man-eating monsters. It has served me well\
  \ so far and—</i></p> \n    <p>A jolt of pain shot up from the base of Krunzle's\
  \ spine to rattle his skull. He felt an even larger one forming where the first\
  \ had begun, like a thundercloud boiling up on the horizon.</p> \n    <p><i>Well,\
  \ if you insist</i>, he thought. Ideas began to form in his mind, a strategy for\
  \ gaining the troll's cooperation. Krunzle watched the sequence of thoughts unravel,\
  \ then said, in his inner voice, <i>No</i>.</p> \n    <p>A jolt of pain shot up\
  \ from his spine again. He spasmed, hissing, so that Raimeau looked at him in alarm.\
  \ The thief ignored the man and the troll, which had also glanced his way, and said\
  \ to Chirk, <i>I did not say ‘no' to the project, but only to your approach.</i></p>\
  \ \n    <p>He was surprised to hear a voice, soft and sibilant, speak in his head.\
  \ <i>It makes sense</i>, came the reply. <i>The creature must hate Ulm and Mordach.\
  \ A chance to take revenge—</i></p> \n    <p>Krunzle cut off the voice. <i>You are\
  \ collecting crumbs, ignoring the cake.</i></p> \n    <p><i>How so?</i></p> \n \
  \   <p><i>Let me show you.</i> He received no response and took the silence for\
  \ acquiescence. Aloud, he spoke to the troll in a carrying whisper: \"Skanderbrog!\
  \ Do you enjoy your work?\"</p> \n    <p>The creature was back at work on the rock\
  \ face. Krunzle saw it regarding him from the corner of one eye while the hammer\
  \ and chisel continued to gouge out chunks of gold-bearing ore. Over the clink of\
  \ iron on iron, he heard a deep-throated growl. \"You mock me?\" Skanderbrog said.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Don't mock him,\" said Raimeau. A full-body shiver had taken possession\
  \ of Krunzle's helper. \"He doesn't like being mocked.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I cannot\
  \ pass the line,\" said the troll, \"but these can.\" He nudged the pile of broken\
  \ rocks with the end of the chisel.</p> \n    <p>\"It's true,\" said Raimeau. \"\
  Boss Ulm had a half-orc overseer named Horkak who used to stand just clear of Mordach's\
  \ line. He would mimic Skanderbrog's labors and make uncomplimentary comparisons.\
  \ One day, the troll picked up a piece of ore and threw it at him. The boundary\
  \ spell heated the stone so greatly that it exploded in Horkak's face. He fell into\
  \ the gorge and broke on the rocks.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Horkak tasted bad,\" Skanderbrog\
  \ said. \"Too much gristle.\" He turned his head to look Krunzle up and down. \"\
  You will be more tender.\"</p> \n    <p>The thief would have gladly ended the conversation\
  \ at that point, but Chirk was insistent. \"I do not mock,\" Krunzle said. \"I wondered\
  \ if you had had enough of working for Boss Ulm. If you might want to move on.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Skanderbrog addressed himself to the rock face. \"I do not like to\
  \ work,\" he said. \"But before I was captured, I starved. I ate frogs and dug for\
  \ worms. I tried to make a place for myself in a cave on the edge of Grunchum's\
  \ territory, but he drove me away. The same happened when I went into the land of\
  \ his neighbor, Brugga. Here, at least I eat well and do not sleep on wet leaves.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Krunzle smiled to himself as he raked the cracked ore toward the men\
  \ who filled the baskets. \"Still,\" he said, \"it's no life for a promising young\
  \ troll.\"</p> \n    <p>The hammer rang on the chisel. Another great wedge of rock\
  \ fell at Skanderbrog's feet. \"It is true; I am not content,\" he said. \"But I\
  \ am resigned to my fate.\"</p> \n    <p>Krunzle let a few moments pass, then he\
  \ said, \"What kind of weapon does Grunchum wield? Or Brugga?\"</p> \n    <p>Skanderbrog\
  \ turned to smash the wedge of gray stone. He cocked his head, remembering. \"They\
  \ are traditionalists,\" he said, \"and favor the long cudgel. They are not particularly\
  \ adept, but they make up for it in sheer power.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Do they eat well?\
  \ As well as you have been eating this past little while?\"</p> \n    <p>It was\
  \ obviously not a question that had occurred to the troll, if indeed questions ever\
  \ did. \"Now that I think of it,\" Skanderbrog said, \"probably not. The odd deer.\
  \ Or a bear when they're still in winter sleep.\"</p> \n    <p>\"And would either\
  \ of them have developed the kind of muscles that now adorn your upper body?\" Krunzle\
  \ said.</p> \n    <p>Again, the troll took a long moment while the dull teeth of\
  \ his mentality engaged the issue. \"Grunchum was big-bellied, but his legs were\
  \ spindly for a troll. Brugga looked as if he had had a good winter. But he's getting\
  \ long in the tooth.\"</p> \n    <p>Krunzle nodded. \"So would either of them expect\
  \ to be confronted by a well-fed, hard-shouldered young challenger armed with an\
  \ iron-headed hammer? Not to mention a sharp iron spike that he could throw like\
  \ a spear?\"</p> \n    <p>The troll paused, the hammer poised. He held the chisel\
  \ out at arm's length and studied it. \"I would have to think about that,\" he said.\
  \ He set the iron spike into a crevice, and brought the hammer down. Splinters of\
  \ rock flew.</p> \n    <p>\"You might also think,\" Krunzle said, \"about how comfortable\
  \ a territory an enterprising troll might make by combining both Grunchum's and\
  \ Brugga's. You did say they were neighbors?\"</p> \n    <p>Skanderbrog had gone\
  \ back to cutting more rock from the cliff. He did not answer, but his expression\
  \ was as thoughtful as his kind could manage.</p> \n    <p><i>We'll let it cook\
  \ for a while</i>, Krunzle told Chirk.</p> \n    <p><i>Where did you learn about\
  \ trolls?</i> the snake said.</p> \n    <p><i>I know nothing about trolls in particular</i>,\
  \ said the traveler, <i>but I know what it is to be young and seeking for a place\
  \ in an uncooperative world. Don't you?</i></p> \n    <p>Chirk was a while in responding.\
  \ My history, it said at length, is different from yours.</p> \n    <p><i>Yet we\
  \ are both bound to another's service, aren't we?</i></p> \n    <p>The snake was\
  \ even longer in giving an answer, so that the traveler thought he would receive\
  \ none. Finally, he heard, <i>You should know that I am not as easily gulled as\
  \ a troll.</i></p> \n    <p><a href=\"/products/btpy8qih\"><b>Purchase the whole\
