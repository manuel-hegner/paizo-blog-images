  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">May is Asian Pacific Islander\
  \ Heritage Month! In this blog, we wanted to give the members of our community the\
  \ chance to introduce themselves and talk about their experiences and influences\
  \ in their own words. Enjoy!</p> \n     <h3>James Case (he/him), Designer</h3> \n\
  \     <p>Hi! It’s James again, still here, still hapa. One of the things I’ve noticed\
  \ more in this last year is that being mixed means your identity can sometimes feel\
  \ like it doesn’t quite belong to you, since it can feel contingent on where you\
  \ happen to be—I mean, I didn’t feel particularly Hawaiian or Asian compared to\
  \ baseline when I lived in… literal Hawaii or Asia. As I’ve been trying to meet\
  \ more API voices in the RPG space, I’ve often found myself staring at, say, a social\
  \ media post calling for “Asian American devs” and wondering if the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVR3B01NxiM\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Tribunal of Mixed Asian Heritage</a> would be okay with me responding\
  \ to it, or whether they need me to wait for something that says “Asian American—\
  and mixed!—devs.” It’s a trip.</p> \n     <p>Regardless! This time last year, I\
  \ could only hint at a few projects still under wraps, but this year, I’m happy\
  \ to report my Ruby Phoenix volume is coming soon and I’ve scattered several Hawaiian\
  \ influences through our books! My favorite has been the nightmarchers, a Hawaiian\
  \ ghost story that my grandfather (now 101!) told me when I was young, and which\
  \ I could show him on a recent trip back home. And there’s more to come~</p> \n\
  \     <p>You can find me on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/toriariaria\"\
  >@toriariaria</a>, where I talk about RPGs some and about J-Rock a lot, so come\
  \ say hi!</p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Dana Ebert (she/her)</h3> \n     <p>I'm a mixed-race\
  \ Filipino-American transgender woman from Portland, OR, where I'm a professional\
  \ Game Master, TTRPG writer, and voice actress. I was a contributor to <em>Pathfinder\
  \ Lost Omens: The Grand Bazaar</em>, and I'm so incredibly excited for you all to\
  \ see the fantastic things that are going into that book! My upcoming projects include\
  \ a submission for <em>Unbreakable Vol. 2</em>, an #OwnVoices anthology of adventures\
  \ inspired by Asian mythology and folklore that's slated for release later this\
  \ year. I'm also a voice actress in <em>League of Ultimate Questing: Battle Axis</em>,\
  \ an actual-play podcast where adventuring is a major league sport, complete with\
  \ sports commentary and hilarious fake ads for in-world products. You can follow\
  \ what I do on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mistressdanarpg\" target=\"\
  _blank\">@MistressDanaRPG</a>, where I'm looking forward to talking more in-depth\
  \ about my Pathfinder contributions as they're released!</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  \ Pathfinder Developer</h3> \n     <p>My grandfather was Nisei, a Japanese American\
  \ son born to first generation Japanese immigrants to America. Being mixed race\
  \ has always left me with a complicated relationship with my heritage, and there\
  \ are times when I hardly think I should be included in this blog! But I have always\
  \ had an interest in the stories and culture of Japan. At Paizo, I've worked to\
  \ try to showcase Asian characters and creatures—not just as foreign abstracts,\
  \ but as a critical part of the Inner Sea. Most recently, I've been happy to bring\
  \ tengu and kitsune to your tables as playable ancestries!</p> \n     <br> \n  \
  \   <h3>John Godek III (he/him)</h3> \n     <p>Hi! I’m John and my mother was from\
  \ the Philippines, where I lived when I was very young. I am an avid TTRPG player\
  \ and GM, playing out of the Emerald City Lodge in Seattle, and having achieved\
  \ my 5th Nova earlier this year. I am also the executive producer for several RPG-oriented\
  \ podcasts on the Know Direction Network: Intrepid Heroes, an actual play for Paizo\
  \ APs; Presenting, where I interview folks in the gaming industry; and Digital Divination,\
  \ where Paizo developer Ron Lundeen and I chat about Starfinder and RPG topics in\
  \ general. Over the past couple years I have had the opportunity to contribute to\
  \ several Paizo products, including the <em>Starship Operations Manual</em> and\
  \ upcoming <em>Galactic Magic</em> hardcovers, the backmatter for two upcoming adventure\
  \ paths, and another unannounced Paizo hardcover. I have also contributed to six\
  \ issues of <em>Stellar Options</em> from Legendary Games, a collection of Starfinder\
  \ player options. When I am not busy with gaming related activities, I am a university\
  \ professor in the Seattle area, teaching entrepreneurship and marketing. Prior\
  \ to that, I was an officer in the US Coast Guard where I sailed the seven seas\
  \ and circumnavigated North America, completing scientific work in the Arctic and\
  \ Antarctic, and law federal enforcement operations on both the East Coast and West\
  \ Coast of the US.</p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Joshua Kim (they/them)</h3> \n   \

  \     <p>When I adapted the creation myth of Pan-gu in 2019, I never dreamed that\
  \ it would lead to me writing for the company whose work got me into TTRPG. A full\
  \ year has passed since I started freelancing and wow, it's been a journey. <em>Bestiary\
  \ 3</em>, Ruby Phoenix, <em>Grand Bazaar</em>, and more to come! All done from the\
  \ other side of the Pacific, thanks to the Internet!</p> \n     <p>Thinking back,\
  \ while my cultural identity and knowledge was crucial in helping me land many early\
  \ gigs, I have to say that being Asian for me in TTRPG space is... complicated.\
  \ Even just typing this took me several attempts because there are so many talking\
  \ points I hesitate to bring up, either because it would need very long explanations,\
  \ or because it might invite controversy. </p> \n     <p>To put things vaguely,\
  \ when your culture comes from a place that constantly threatens to erase your home\
  \ country from existence (and you along with it), there's a lot of conflicting feelings\
  \ and delicate dancing to do every time you put out work inspired by the culture.\
  \ You can't erase the history that made you, nor can anyone else. However, if stating\
  \ your identity blatantly might result in backlash, would you ever be ready for\
  \ the consequences?</p> \n     <p>I haven’t an answer, but I know I am still writing.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>You can see what I'm up to via my Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/senhhs\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">@SenHHS</a>. Also, I'll be at the Ruby Phoenix panel at PaizoCon\
  \ Online, so come say hi!</p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Ruvaid Virk (he/him)</h3> \n\
  \     <p>Hi everybody! I’m Ruvaid, a Pakistani-American, and among the newest crop\
  \ of freelancers to write for Paizo. <em>Bestiary 3</em> was my first assignment,\
  \ and I have more work in the upcoming Fists of the Ruby Phoenix AP and <em>Secrets\
  \ of Magic</em>. Please look forward to it!</p> \n     <p> Growing up, I didn’t\
  \ even know what TTRPGs were. It wasn’t until I entered college and met some of\
  \ my closest friends that I even got a chance to play my first tabletop game, a\
  \ little thing called Pathfinder. So, to have the opportunity to be a part of this\
  \ blog and have my name show up in Pathfinder books honestly still feels surreal.\
  \ </p> \n     <p> I’m glad to be a part of such a welcoming community, and I’ve\
  \ had a great time meeting awesome people. Thanks for having me, and I can’t wait\
  \ to put more content out there for you all to enjoy. </p> \n     <p>I also have\
  \ a Discord group where I organize PFS2e games every Saturday morning at 9am EDT/6am\
  \ PDT that anyone interested is welcome to join! Outside of tabletops, I enjoy practicing\
  \ calligraphy when I can. I also love bad puns, playing board games, reading and\
  \ writing fantasy, and playing the critically acclaimed MMORPG <em>Final Fantasy\
  \ XIV</em>.</p> \n     <p>You can find me on Twitter (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Darth_Ruvaider\"\
