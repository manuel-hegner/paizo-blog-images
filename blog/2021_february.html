                <h3>Phinelli’s Miracle Elixir — Severe 3</h3> 
                <p>Edolpho Phinelli, the notorious con artist, has developed a new scheme. He’s selling an elixir that he claims can heal wounds, erase scars, and regrow hair. The citizens that live in the red light district are buying it by the case-full. Edolpho is looking to get rich quick! Fast enough to hop on a ship out of the city with enough earnings to set himself up in a new town.</p> 
                <p>The elixir is, of course, a watered-down minor elixir of life mixed with several inexpensive alchemical reagents. The effects are an intense euphoria followed by a heavy hangover unless more of the elixir is ingested. He’s selling each dose for 1 gp. While the brew does restore 1d2–1 Hit Points, the fumes the imbiber belches carry tuberculosis (<em>Pathfinder Gamemastery Guide 118</em>), exposing themselves and anyone around them for 1 hour after they’ve consumed the elixir.</p> 
                <p>An outbreak of tuberculosis has started to spread throughout the district and the city guard are getting desperate. They suspect that this new “miracle cure” might have something to do with it, but their forces are spread thin due to the disease and a long-standing labor dispute. They’ve hired the adventurers to investigate and point them toward Edolpho’s last known location—a shipping crate dais overlooking the canal.</p> 
                <p><b>Creatures</b>: Edolpho stands above a crowd of roughly a dozen onlookers, waving his arms and barking his well-rehearsed pitch. Two burly assistants flank the charlatan, holding up vials of his wares and waving them enticingly in the audience’s faces. If the adventurers approach him looking to incite violence, then Edolpho’s two “assistants” step in to carry out their true role as bodyguards, putting themselves between the PCs and their employer, and trying to push any attackers into the adjacent canal. Given his control of the rapt crowd and the carefully staged environment, Edolpho uses Performance instead of Perception when rolling initiative.</p> 
                <p>He also attempts to turn the fervent (and quite addicted) crowd against the adventurers. If the adventurers succeed at a DC 18 Diplomacy or Deception check to persuade the crowd that the elixir is toxic, then the commoners disperse as soon as violence commences. Otherwise, they fervently attempt to defend their elixir supplier.</p> 
                <p>Any commoner who is damaged immediately flees. If the bodyguards reach 5 Hit Points or fewer, they surrender. Edolpho attempts to flee if he reaches 10 Hit Points or fewer but refuses to surrender. If cornered, he attempts to bribe the adventurers.</p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/5dbf9f48-726d-425b-a6b6-8416288f1f35/022521_Merchant.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/5dbf9f48-726d-425b-a6b6-8416288f1f35/022521_Merchant.jpg" align="left" width="400" style="padding: 10px;" alt="A grizzled merchant holding their coat open to show off their potions and wares to sell"></a>

                <p>But this book has more than new ancestries. It’s chock-full of new lore, heritages, and feats to expand the ancestries and versatile heritages from the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq023ih?Pathfinder-Advanced-Players-Guide">Advanced Player’s Guide</a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01zt4?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Character-Guide">Pathfinder Lost Omens: Character Guide</a>--so if your character’s ancestry and heritage aren’t from the Core Rulebook, there’s probably something new for you on the <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/characteroptions">Character Options</a> page! One of the ancestries featured in this book, the azarketi, will be featured in a book that hasn't been released yet: Absalom, City of Lost Omens. In the meantime, the ancestry’s rules appear as a <a href="https://paizo-images.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/image/download/Azarketi+Ancestry.pdf">free download here</a>, and we’ve gone ahead and sanctioned them as well.</p> 
                <p>Speaking of expanding your horizons beyond the Core Rulebook’s ancestries, you can now receive Pathfinder Society credit for playing <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq023hg?Pathfinder-Adventure-The-Slithering">The Slithering</a>. Play as a kobold, lizardfolk, orc, or catfolk on a quest to save the city of Kibwe from a horrific curse. This brings us current in sanctioning Pathfinder Adventures for credit in the Pathfinder Society.</p> 
                <p>This month’s update to the Character Options page also includes updates to the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01zp4?Pathfinder-Bestiary">Pathfinder Bestiary</a>. The update to the Bestiary opens up the Bestiary languages to characters who have means of learning uncommon languages, like your Multilingual PCs. I know folks are wondering about Bestiary 2 as well. We’ve started work on it, but it’s a bigger project, so we’ll need a bit more time. Once that’s ready, we’ll be sure to let you know.</p> 
                <p>We’re still working on the next project for Starfinder sanctioning and will have more information in the March update blog next week.</p>

                <h3>Expanded Ancestries and Heritages</h3> 
                <p>The first half of the book provides an in-depth look at ancestries and versatile heritages that premiered in previous book. Each entry presents information on how each ancestry or heritage fits in the Lost Omens setting as well as provide new ancestry feats, heritages, and lineages. The section includes the following entries.</p> 
                <p><b>Aasimar (Calder CaDavid):</b> Aasimars result from celestial influence, but only rarely are they literally descended from celestials, more often coming from special blessings or the residual energies in holy places. This book presents three new lineages, emberkin, idyllkin, and plumekith, for aasimars descended from peris, agathions, and garudas respectively.</p> 
                <p><b>Azarketi (Jessica Catalan):</b> Often known as “gillmen” or “Low Azlanti,” azarketis are the descendants of the Azlanti Empire. They survived Earthfall by being mutated by their foes, the alghollthus, to become an aquatic people tied forever to seas and waterways—but their history draws them back to the land. This book presents new azarketi options, exploring their magical connection to water and adds the inured, murkeyed, spined, and tactile azarketi heritages.</p> 
                <p>Check out the Azarketi ancestry today with this <a href="https://paizo-images.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/image/download/Azarketi+Ancestry.pdf">pdf download</a>!</p> 
                <p><b>Catfolk (David N. Ross):</b> Native to the nation of Murraseth in southern Garund, catfolk are feline humanoids who believe they were created to hunt down threats to Golarion as a whole. This book presents new options to double down on catfolk’s agility and luck and adds the flexible, liminal, and sharp-eared catfolk heritages.</p> 
                <p><b>Changeling (Isabelle Thorne):</b> The offspring of wicked hags, changelings are often left in the cradles of their mortal parent’s people and raised without understanding what makes them different. They often feel disconnected from their communities early in life, the subtle call of their hag mother coaxing them to abandon those they love. This book presents the moon may, snow may, veil may, and virga may lineages for changelings descended from moon hags, winter hags, blood hags, and storm hags respectively.</p> 
                <p><b>Dhampir (Lyz Liddell):</b> Dhampirs are mortals descended from a living and a vampiric parent. Marked forever by their hungers, some may learn to draw strength from the blood of others, while others drink subtler substances, such as pain. This book presents three new lineages, adhyabhau, cel rau, and ru-shi, for dhampirs descended from psychic, strigoi, and jiang-shi vampires.</p> 
                <p><b>Duskwalker (Mikhail Rekun):</b> Reincarnated souls, duskwalkers gained leave to have one more chance at life. All duskwalkers have strong connections to their previous identities, but each must decide for themselves whether to learn more about their past or forge a new path. This book contains options for duskwalkers based on how their previous life ended.</p> 
                <p><b>Hobgoblin (Owen K.C. Stephens):</b> Many hobgoblins have been drawn toward the nation of Oprak, which seeks to forge pacts and earn respect through methods other than war and conquest. While clearly related to their goblin cousins, hobgoblins are less frenetic and more careful planners. This book contains options for hobgoblins to assist their fellow warriors or to tap into the legendary Cantorian Spring—the source of the hobgoblin ancestry—to gain healing effects. It also introduces the shortshanks and steelskin hobgoblin heritages.</p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/c1266455-b649-4567-b8ee-bb277569c79b/022421_cactusleshy.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/c1266455-b649-4567-b8ee-bb277569c79b/022421_cactusleshy.jpg" align="left" width="300" style="padding: 10px;" alt="A cactus leshy.

                <p style="font-size: 13px;">Art by Alex Stone</p> 
                <p><b>Kobold (Owen K.C. Stephens):</b> These expert trap makers often live in secluded places that most other ancestries eschew. Kobolds operate in a world of larger, stronger creatures who often dismiss them—until these cunning survivors reveal what they can unleash on their foes. This book contains options for kobolds to improve their use of traps and kobold weapons, and even to grow draconic wings. It also includes the caveclimber and tunnelflood kobold heritages.</p> 
                <p><b>Leshy (Linda Zayas-Palmer):</b> Leshys are immortal spirits temporarily given mortal forms in bodies made of plants and fungi. Created by powerful primal rituals, leshys come into the world fully formed and self-sufficient, independent of any settlement or even the ritualist that gave them form. This book grows the leshy options by adding the cactus, fruit, lotus, root, and seaweed leshy heritages.</p> 
                <p><b>Lizardfolk (Patchen Mortimer):</b> The powerful reptilian lizardfolk call themselves iruxi and have a history that stretches back thousands of years. Patient and confident, lizardfolk explorers travel from their ancient nations to explore the world of younger ancestries and kingdoms. This book contains options for lizardfolk to gain insights from astrology or power from the bones of their ancestors and adds the cloudleaper and woodstalker lizardfolk heritages.</p> 
                <p><b>Orc (Calder CaDavid):</b> Orcs were driven from their homelands by the dwarven Quest for Sky and thrust into a foreign world where they had to carve a place for themselves. A troubled history of warfare and grudges has left most orcs at odds with other surface ancestries. This book contains options for orcs to gain power from special painted warmasks. It also introduces the battle-ready, grave, and winter orc heritages.</p> 
                <p><b>Ratfolk (Patchen Mortimer):</b> Small rodentlike humanoids, ratfolk are clever, adaptive, and communalist. Known amongst themselves as ysoki, ratfolk are natural explorers, travelers, and, most of all, merchants. This book contains options for ratfolk to squish, sneak, roll, and otherwise move about. It also adds the snow and tunnel rat heritages.</p> 
                <p><b>Tengu (Eleanor Ferron):</b> The beaked and feathered tengu originate from Tian Xia. Nearly always in the minority, tengu have learned to use their knack for languages and blades to find space for themselves. This book contains options for tengu to store magic in specially made fans and adds the dogtooth and wavediver tengu heritages.</p> 
                <p><b>Tiefling (Mikhail Rekun):</b> Tieflings are planar scions born with a fiendish stain in their blood. Though tieflings are not inherently evil, they are often mistrusted and many do find that fiendish powers and associated temptations come easily. This book presents the beastbrood, riftmarked, and shackleborn lineages for tieflings descended from rakshasas, qlippoths, and velstracs respectively.</p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/7bd85011-51db-4e3f-af37-57669668fdd9/022421_enshrakorc.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/7bd85011-51db-4e3f-af37-57669668fdd9/022421_enshrakorc.jpg" align="left" width="300" style="padding: 10px;" alt="An Enshrak orc.

                <h3>New Ancestries and Heritages</h3> 
                <p>The latter half of the book introduces new ancestries and heritages to Pathfinder Second Edition. Some of these entries include old favorites making their second edition premiere and even includes some brand new entries, each with their own rules options. The section includes the following entries.</p> 
                <p><b>Android (Jessica Catalan):</b> Brought to Golarion by a starship crash in the land of Numeria, androids are half organic, half-machine lifeforms produced by alien technology. Though often looked upon with fear by superstitious communities surrounding the crash site, changing politics and the rise of the android goddess Casandalee have led to androids expanding their influence in nearby regions. The section includes feats that allow androids to tap into the power of their nanites and the artisan, impersonator, laborer, polyglot, and warrior android heritages.</p> 
                <p><b>Aphorite (Andrew Mullen):</b> Aphorites are beings with a mortal base infused with the pure essence of law by the enigmatic axiomites of Axis. Originally designed to form a diplomatic bridge between the perfect logic of the axiomites and the constant contradictions of free-willed creatures, aphorites’ ability to choose has seen them grow beyond their original intent and into their own people. This versatile heritage allows a character use the crystalline motes that cover their body to conceal themselves or their allies.</p> 
                <p><b>Beastkin (Luis Loza):</b> While most werecreatures are cursed with bloodlust at the sight of the full moon, some of their kin are born without this dire affliction. These beastkin are a source of respect and envy among their fellows, as they also lack werecreatures’ burning vulnerability to silver. This versatile heritage allows for characters with a connection of animals of any type that can tap into their animalistic instincts and senses.</p> 
                <p><b>Fetchling (Andrew Mullen):</b> Fetchlings are scions of Ancient Azlant who escaped the cataclysm of Earthfall by fleeing to the Shadow Plane. As generations passed, more and more supernatural gloom seeped into these refugees until they evolved into something beyond their human origins. Fetchlings can gain control over their shadows and are shaped by the bright, deep, liminal, resolute, and wisp fetchling heritages.</p> 
                <p><b>Fleshwarp (Ron Lundeen):</b> Fleshwarps are beings transformed either by magic or by technology beyond Golarion’s ken. Most commonly, they result from drow or other sinister forces transforming their victims out of sadism, yet fleshwarps can also be created from scratch through magical or alchemical manipulation of raw tissue. Fleshwarps are capable of transforming their bodies further to gain darkvision or grow new weapons. Depending on the nature of their transformation, a fleshwarp will have the created, mutated, shapewrought, or technological fleshwarp heritage.</p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/832395d7-dd45-495d-ba1f-4bbc1b2669fc/022421_eaglekin.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/832395d7-dd45-495d-ba1f-4bbc1b2669fc/022421_eaglekin.jpg" align="left" width="300" style="padding: 10px;" alt="An eaglekin.

                <p style="font-size: 13px;">Art by Rashad Pozdnyakov</p> 
                <p><b>Ganzi (Isabelle Thorne):</b> Born wherever and whenever they’re least expected, these scions of chaos rarely conform to any overarching culture among themselves. Ganzi reside in the greatest numbers in the nation of Holomog, with their influence spilling out into Nex, Geb, and the Mwangi Expanse. The ganzi versatile heritage allows characters to tap into the power of chaos and produce random magic or new body parts.</p> 
                <p><b>Geniekin (Jessica Redekop):</b> Kin to the elements and infused with the power of the planes within the Inner Sphere, geniekin live scattered all over the world, especially wherever extreme environments provide a conduit to primal energy. Most commonly found in Katapesh and Qadira, many geniekin gather in small communities both within and outside of major cities. Geniekin include five new versatile heritages: ifrits, keepers of elemental fire; oreads, wardens of elemental earth; sylphs, followers of the freedom of elemental air; undines, individuals adaptable like elemental water; and sulis, embodiments of the complex relationships between multiple elements.</p> 
                <p><b>Kitsune (James Case):</b> Kitsune change shapes as easily as clothing, often living undetected among other peoples. Though these mischievous tricksters almost never gather in numbers large enough for political clout, their natural charisma and cunning mean they can have a significant impact on worldly events. Kitune are wielders of powerful magic and have the celestial envoy, dark fields, earthly wilds, empty sky, and frozen wind kitsune heritages.</p> 
                <p><b>Sprite (Mark Seifter):</b> As denizens of the First World, sprites sometimes tire of their realm where choices hold no permanence and consequences don’t matter. These Tiny fey venture into the Material Plane in hopes of making their own mark. Sprites can empower their wings to grant them flight and sprite heritages vary to include draxies, grigs, luminous sprites, melixies, nykterasm, and pixies.</p> 
                <p><b>Strix (Samantha Phelan):</b> These avian humanoids maintain small populations within Cheliax and the surrounding environs. Long persecuted by the humanocentric rule of House Thrune, strix have been enemies of the Chelaxian state for almost a century. This section provides feats that allow strix to take to the skies and attack with their wings, as well as the nightglider, predator, scavenger, shoreline, and songbird strix heritages.</p> 
                <p><b>Ancestral Gear (Luis Loza):</b> The book’s final section provides new weapons and magic items with ties to the ancestries of Golarion.</p>

                <h3>Vizaix, Reluctant Mercenary</h3> 
                <p>Vizaix owes his life to a ysoki scavenger named Arlos who helped him narrowly escape being press-ganged by Akitonian munitions smugglers. Vizaix is known to smile at Arlos’s jokes from time to time and even calls the ysoki his friend, but he has trouble believing other people like him, given gnolls’ reputations as bloodthirsty cannibals. It doesn’t help that Vizaix has trouble reading others’ emotions and intentions—he relies heavily on Arlos in most social situations.</p> 
                <p>Arlos recently encouraged Vizaix to put his skills to good use, explore Near Space, and make a few more friends. The gnoll is offering his services as a mercenary, hired security, or hunter, especially with smaller crews where he won’t have to remember so many names. When he wants to ease into conversations with potential employers, Vizaix tells one of Arlos’s jokes—even if he doesn’t “get” them himself, he has found that the jokes help others see him as more than just a gnoll and a soldier.</p> 
                <p>When he is overstimulated—especially after a battle or heated social confrontation—Vizaix needs several minutes alone to calm his anger. He recenters himself by methodically checking his equipment and muttering punchlines. Though he is uncomfortable around others, he values teamwork and has a stronger sense of personal accountability and morality than many gnolls, especially when it comes to his companions.</p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/9dbed918-6aca-4ef8-b98a-ffd2e72bb6ab/022421_Gnoll.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/9dbed918-6aca-4ef8-b98a-ffd2e72bb6ab/022421_Gnoll.jpg" align="left" width="350" style="padding: 10px;" alt="A hyena-headed humanoid wears yellow, futuristic armor and wields a space rifle."></a>

                <h3>Plot Hooks</h3> 
                <p>Game Masters might consider the following plot hooks as a means of integrating Vizaix into any Starfinder game.</p> 
                <ul> 
                 <li>Vizaix has learned that his most recent employers are using funds from their last job to fund an illegal poaching outfit. He has inside knowledge about their plans, and their ship, but he needs help to sabotage their efforts.</li> 
                 <li>The ysoki, Arlos, is looking for someone to go in search of Vizaix, who was working security on a starship in the Diaspora that has been missing for 3 months.</li> 
                 <li>Vizaix hates the instability of mercenary life, but he is having trouble getting more permanent employment. He asks to accompany the PCs on a mission, hoping his association with them leads to further opportunities.</li> 
                </ul>

            <p itemprop="description">Hey everyone! Michael Sayre here, ready to discuss the Pathfinder Guns &amp; Gears playtest that just wrapped up! We’ve had some time to go over the survey results and contextualize all of the amazing posts, videos, and playtest reports you all shared during the course of the playtest. Now that we’ve had a chance to go over that data ourselves and make some decisions, we’re here to talk to you a bit about the direction we’d like to take. Keep in mind, while we’re going to talk about some broad points here, there are likely to be dozens of little changes throughout both classes—covering everything from adding more feats and class options to minor tweaks in the way existing abilities or options function. Just because we don’t mention something here doesn’t mean it won’t get some kind of love and attention during development. We’re just hitting the highlight reel!

                <h3>Gunslinger</h3> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/f68010b7-5697-402c-8ccc-b840849b0b0d/012221_PZO2109_Gunslinger01.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/f68010b7-5697-402c-8ccc-b840849b0b0d/012221_PZO2109_Gunslinger01.jpg" align="left" width="300" style="padding: 10px;" alt="pathfinder guns and gears second edition playtest gunslinger iconic with a large rifle over her shoulder"></a> 
                <p>Not surprisingly, a lot of the feedback on the gunslinger focused on the execution of firearms and the Reload mechanic. We also collected some really remarkable data related to the gunslinger ways, so I want to be sure to spend some time exploring what that data could mean for us going forward. Finally, I’m going to talk a bit about the types of gear that weren’t present in the playtest, but that should have a significant impact thanks to inclusion in the final release.</p> 
                <p><b>Firearms</b>: Firearms remain a divisive subject when it comes to fantasy roleplaying games, and this particular iteration was no exception, though we did learn some interesting information. The first and most relevant data point suggests that the version of guns we have in the playtest are far and away the most popular choice for how people want to see firearms executed in this edition, so we’re going to stick pretty close to that model. That being said, there are opportunities for improvement here.</p> 
                <p>The first thing I’ll note is that the final version of <em>Guns &amp; Gears</em> is going to have more than double the number of firearms than the playtest had. This is going to include things like one-handed scatter weapons and guns that fire big, relatively slow-moving rounds that have a higher base damage die but no fatal property. We also plan to incorporate quite a few other variations on the theme that you’ll have to wait to see more of in the final book!</p> 
                <p>We also embraced a conservative approach to firearm design going into this playtest, keeping the ranges very tight to represent the relative inaccuracy of these kinds of smooth bore weapons and using primarily preexisting weapon traits that people already know how to use. As we go through and develop all of the firearms, we’ll consider opportunities to explore these options: such as extending the range of a few different weapons, potentially introducing new traits that do a better job of telling the story of a firearm, and addressing small oversights in the playtest options. For example, the penalty and action cost for unsteady probably shouldn’t apply to a prone character, so adding that clarification should enhance the usability of unsteady weapons while also adding interesting new dynamics to feats like Hit the Dirt!</p> 
                <p><b>Reload</b>: Reload times inspired a lot of constructive debate during the playtest. Many people found that they were an important part of the story of firearms and greatly preferred the tone and era of weapons we used in the playtest, feeling that they were a more natural fit for a fantasy world than things like revolvers and cartridge-loaded rifles. Others felt like the action cost of reloading was a real stumbling block that got in the way a player making the character they wanted. Running Reload was an incredibly popular feat choice for really helping people maximize the value of that action. Consequently, we’re looking at granting each of the gunslinger ways their own unique Reload action. For example, gunslingers who choose the way of the sniper could receive a built-in action to Reload and Hide or Take Cover. We’ll also likely use some of the additional feats that will appear in the final version of the class to expand your options for more robust Reload activities even more, giving gunslingers a highly efficient action economy with lots of ways to interact with the battlefield.</p> 
                <p><b>Gunslinger Ways</b>: So, normally in any playtest for a class that has multiple “subpath” options, there’s a clear first-place choice that selected significantly more often by players. That was not the case with the gunslinger ways. While there were small variations between the number of people choosing a given way, they were each so close to a third of the total respondents that it was clear that each of these concepts has just as much draw and appeal as the others. As a result, it’s pretty likely that each of these ways will be present in the final release, though with some changes informed by the experiences from this playtest. A lot of the feedback we received also suggested some possibilities for new ways that weren’t featured in the playtest, so we’ll be looking into those as well. Expect these concepts to stick around but their execution to evolve in multiple ways (pun intended) going forward.</p> 
                <p><b>Gear</b>: This is one area where I wish we’d just had a little more time before the playtest to show you what we’ve got lined up, as I think that would have had a really positive impact on some playtesters’ experiences. That said, I think this is as good a place to give you a sneak peek at what’s ahead as any. First, let me just say this. Yes, we plan to include bayonets in the final release. </p> 
                <p>More than that, we’re looking at an entire section of the book that explores black powder and the things you can do with it (like leaving a trail of powder you can light on fire to blow up a powder keg) and the things you can’t (like igniting it underwater). We are going to include cool options and accessories you can use to customize your gun, though, and that’ll feature options for using your preferred weapon in just about any environment, including underwater. We’re looking at all kinds of choices for accessories, from scopes to holsters, bandoliers to weaponized bipod/tripods, and just about anything else you can think of to customize your gunslinger. There’s always going to be more cool ideas for a product than you can fit into the page count, but we’ll continue to provide players as much variety and as many unique avenues for their character builds as we can.</p> 
                <p>And that’s about all I’ve got for you at the moment. I’ll pass this over to Mark so he can talk about the inventor!</p>

               </blockquote>
              </div> 
              <p>Hi everyone! Mark Seifter here for a post-playtest report for the inventor class. I want to start off by thanking you all so much for your feedback, and especially for the way you've given it to us. At the start of the playtest, I mentioned that since we had two playtests so close to each other, we needed the community's help to avoid too many circular arguments and focus on new data and analyses on various topics. And boy did you deliver! So thank you for giving us great data, ideas, and feedback. This helps make it easy for us to follow along and incorporate your ideas. In terms of the ratio of insights to arguments, this playtest has one of the best I've ever seen, and that starts with you. </p> 
              <p>Overall people really liked the inventor, almost as much as the swashbuckler with a big gap before the summoner, gunslinger, and a few others that are clustered below. But that doesn't mean that there aren't things about the class that need to change. Brigh knows, I even announced in the “Welcome to the Inventor” thread that unstable had to change after we accidentally didn't use the version asked about in the survey! Thank you for bearing with me on this journey and also at looking past the roughness with unstable to really dig deep on every other aspect of the class, which needed a close eye too.</p> 
              <p><b>Unstable</b>: The unstable trait will change. My goal is to make the trait present a gamble that weighs risk versus reward. Unlike the playtest version, you'll always get to perform the action when you take the risk. The gamble will be whether something goes wrong, causing something bad to happen in addition to the action succeeding. I have one very exciting idea for this that I can't share yet until I'm sure it works. In the meantime, if you want to keep playing your inventor in your home game, you can just roll the flat check after you use the unstable ability (including the first time) to see if you can use it again. I'm hoping the final version will be more exciting than that, but that should work okay for now. </p> 
              <p><b>Gadgets</b>: We will be adding a fun gadgets feat path for the inventor to make special gadgets each day! It won't be mandatory, as most playtesters expressed that they didn’t want it to be. It will be nice to include it as an option so a player can opt in to the complexity that comes with having to read through a big gadget section.</p> 
              <p><b>Innovations</b>: Playtesters asked for more options for modifications and feats for innovations, and the final version will add more of them. All of you inventor playtesters really captured the weird science vibe and had some great ideas, and I took careful and extensive notes. For example, giving the construct companion with a ranged attack a "turret mode" option sounds like a lot of fun, and playtesters had some great ideas for ways to increase the construct's abilities at the expense of the inventor's actions. This helps lend support the playstyle of inventors who want to hang back and let the construct do the work. In that vein, I'm strongly considering giving the construct innovation inventor the baked in ability to spend two actions to give the construct three. This will allow the construct to move and Explode, for example, and helps avoid friendly fire.</p> 
              <p><b>Overdrive</b>: While the inventor's special powers are dispersed throughout several abilities, playtesters were interested in consolidating a little more of them into Overdrive, and that's something I'm definitely looking into. If that occurs, expect to see Overdrive scale a bit more than it does now, especially on a success. Hopefully, I’ll be able to do so just enough to make a big difference.</p> 
              <p>These are just a few of the ways in which I'm tinkering and tweaking my invention thanks to your notes and efforts. In the end, expect the class to look extremely similar to the way it does right now, except with several little improvements in almost every area that will really add up in the long run. </p> 
              <p>Thanks for reading! For sticking to the end, we’re throwing in an advance treat from the book, an intelligent weapon! The final version is very likely to be one of the new types of gun in the book, but this version for the blog uses the basic pistol so you can throw it into your game right away and have it start mouthing off at enemies.</p> 
              <h4>Sunken Pistol — Item 8</h4> 
              <p><b>Rare, CN, Arcane, Enchantment, Intelligent</b><br> </p>
              <p><b>Usage</b> held in 1 hand; Bulk 1<br> <b>Perception</b> +12; precise vision 30 feet, imprecise hearing 30 feet<br> <b>Communication</b> speech (Common)<br> <b>Skills</b> Intimidation +19, Navigation Lore +14, Sailing Lore +14<br> <b>Int</b> +0, <b>Wis</b> +2, <b>Cha</b> +4<br> <b>Will</b> +16</p> 
              <p>A <em>sunken pistol</em> is imbued with the unfulfilled desires and insatiable greed of its previous wielder, a notorious pirate drowned at sea. Once a beautiful and artistically wrought weapon, a <em>sunken pistol</em> is coated in a fine layer of dried salt and is encrusted with barnacles. Each shot fired from this <em>+1 striking flintlock pistol</em> is coated in a layer of salty ectoplasm, and has the effects of a ghost touch rune. You can shoot the <em>sunken pistol</em> underwater, even when using black powder ammunition.</p> 
              <p>A <em>sunken pistol</em> urges you to amass a horde of treasure even a dragon would be proud of. The methods used to acquire these riches matter not to the greedy pirate pistol, so long as you amass and hoard excessive wealth. Above all else, a <em>sunken pistol</em> desires the return of its own treasure, which might rest in the wreck of its sunken ship’s hold or be hidden on a dangerous island.</p> 
              <p>In pursuit of treasure, a <em>sunken pistol</em> offers nautical and navigation advice to you, though it refuses such aid during less lucrative ventures. If you prove a profitable partner, the <em>sunken pistol</em> aids you in combat by Demoralizing your opponents (see the first Activation below). If you prove charitable or unwilling to retrieve its treasure, the <em>sunken pistol</em> turns its ire on you, Demoralizing you during combat until you relent. If you repeatedly refuse the <em>sunken pistol</em>, it would be wise to not accept <em>water breathing</em> from it, as it might attempt to drown you to allow a more suitable wielder to acquire it from your corpse. The sunken pistol can use the following activations.</p> 
              <p><b>Activate</b> [one-action] command; <b>Frequency</b> once per minute; <b>Effect</b> The <em>sunken pistol</em> curses and insults a creature it can see, attempting an Intimidation check to Demoralize that creature.</p> 
              <p><b>Activate</b> [three-actions] command; <b>Frequency</b> once per day; <b>Effect</b> The <em>sunken pistol</em> casts <em>water breathing</em> on you as a 3rd-level arcane spell. The <em>sunken pistol</em> can Dismiss this spell, so be sure to keep the gun happy if you’re relying on its good graces to breathe!</p>

               <p>First, from Aballon, we have two sizes of SRO (Small and Medium commons) as well as the eye-covered predator known as the Sharpwing (Large rare).</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/e394f71b-6ca2-46cf-a8aa-a6251078e611/022221_SRO-small.jpg"><img width="30%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/e394f71b-6ca2-46cf-a8aa-a6251078e611/022221_SRO-small.jpg" hspace="5" alt="Starfinder SRO Small mini figure"></a> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/3d920281-7bb8-4ec1-8553-28001c03a5c8/022221_SRO-medium.jpg"><img width="30%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/3d920281-7bb8-4ec1-8553-28001c03a5c8/022221_SRO-medium.jpg" hspace="5" alt="Starfinder SRO Medium mini figure"></a> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/5fafaaf0-776f-4c81-aec7-6068efc47a60/022221_Sharpwing.jpg"><img width="30%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/5fafaaf0-776f-4c81-aec7-6068efc47a60/022221_Sharpwing.jpg" hspace="5" alt="Mini figure of a Sharpwing, a purple, winged, alien, covered in yellow eyes"></a>

               <p>Next, hailing from Castrovel is the Formian Warrior (Medium uncommon), the plantlike people known as the Khizar (Medium uncommon), the three-legged laser-wolves known as Tashtari (Medium uncmmon), and the predatory Vracinea (Large rare). (The <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shk5?Set-Course-For-Planets-of-Peril">ksarik</a> was among the first figures we revealed, so you’ve already seen that one!)</p>

               <p>Skipping Absalom Station and moving straight on to the red planet of Akiton, we have the four-armed giant Shobhad (large uncommon). Hailing from the Diaspora asteroid belt is the winged Sarcesian Sniper (Large uncommon). We cruise past a few more planets since we’ve already seen the <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shk5?Set-Course-For-Planets-of-Peril">dragonkin</a>, but we must stop at Liavara to glimpse the Bantrid (Small uncommon) who makes its home on the shepherd moon of Hibb. While Liavara itself is home to the entities known as dreamers, they’re physiologically identical to the <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shk5?Set-Course-For-Planets-of-Peril">barathus</a> of neighboring Bretheda, and they showed up at the very beginning of this journey, so we’ll move on to the last stop on the trip: the mysterious planet of Aucturn, where the Orocoran (Medium rare) lives.</p>

While I’d love to go on and explore more amazing aliens in plastic form, right now I’m going to take a break. Lie down. Get some rest. The strangely melodious tinnitus that has accosted me since we left Aucturn is growing to an unbearable cacophony, and I must get sleep. While I slumber in dreams I’m sure will be nothing but pleasant, may you all enjoy your new Starfinder miniatures, friends, and stay safe!</p>

               <p>It seems unfair to only let players take these classic fantasy species for a spin in the Pact Worlds, so here are some rules for GMs. Use these creature subtype grafts when crafting NPCs of the associated species.

               <p itemprop="description">Last week, we shared a no-prep character, Urok, to give you a brief glimpse at the orderly aphorite versatile heritage. We have another NPC this week showcasing another unrevealed aspect from <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq026k5?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Ancestry-Guide"><em>Lost Omens Ancestry Guide</em></a>. This week we’re going to preview another new versatile heritage: beastkin! I’ll talk a bit more about beastkin after showing you the NPC, but for now, let’s look at our no-prep beastkin, Chea.</p> 
               <h3>Chea, Student of Unfolding Wind</h3> 
               <p>Born to a large family of werecrocodiles in the nation of Jalmeray, Chea was envied by her fellows for her strange lack of the werecreature's curse. Chea's mother assured the girl that her blessing proved she was meant for great things, though her bitter cousins mocked her for her soft heart and lack of killer instinct. One night when she was a teenager, she went out for a swim, sick of the insults and teasing from her peers. The beastkin accidentally stumbled across an adventurer, who was stargazing by the riverside. The strange woman didn't attack, however, instead introducing herself as Nisha and inviting Chea to come look at the stars. Nisha pointed out a glowing comet in the sky and told Chea that the star was actually an elemental lord named Ranginori, and that Nisha's fellow adventurers, the Pathfinders, were working to set Ranginori free. When Nisha left that evening, she gave her telescope to Chea. From then on, Chea spent her nights gazing up to the glowing star, whispering secret prayers in hope they might comfort the trapped god.</p> 
               <p>Chea saw the moment her bright star burst across the sky, freeing Ranginori from his uncounted years of imprisonment. Knowing the hard journey that Ranginori faced ahead of him, Chea was among one of the first to pledge her faith to the elemental lord. Encouraged by her mother, Chea approached the Monastery of Unfolding Wind in Jalmeray. Though she had to hide her true nature from her fellow acolytes, her determination saw her excel in her monk training. Yet when she returned to visit her family after her initial studies were complete, she found them decimated and scattered. The survivors gave confused, conflicted reports, but several of them claimed that Pathfinders had attacked them.</p> 
               <p>Though Chea knew her family weren't always saints, she found she couldn't let this go. The monk now searches for answers to what truly happened, and vengeance for those who killed her kin.</p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/516e9c59-a320-4bbe-b485-a862cc091321/021821_Chea.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/516e9c59-a320-4bbe-b485-a862cc091321/021821_Chea.jpg" align="left" width="400" style="padding: 10px;" alt="A human woman covered in crocodile’s scales is clad in monk’s robes.

               <p><b>Melee</b> [one-action] fist +19 (agile, finesse, magical, nonlethal, unarmed), <b>Damage</b> 2d6+11 bludgeoning</p> 
               <p><b>Melee</b> [one-action] jaws +19 (agile, finesse, magical, unarmed), <b>Damage</b> 2d4+11 piercing</p> 
               <p><b>Ranged</b> [one-action] wind crash +19 (agile, nonlethal, propulsive, range 30 feet, unarmed), <b>Damage</b> 2d6+11 bludgeoning</p> 
               <p><b>Monk Focus Spells</b> DC 25, attack +17; <b>5th</b> (3 Focus Points) <em>ki rush</em> (Core Rulebook 401), <em>ki strike</em> (Core Rulebook 401), <em>unfolding wind rush</em> (Lost Omens World Guide 83) <em>wild winds stance</em> (<em>Core Rulebook</em> 402)</p> 
               <p><b>Change Shape</b> [one-action] (concentrate, polymorph, primal, transmutation) Chea changes between her humanoid shape or hybrid shape. She gains a jaws unarmed Strike while in her hybrid shape.</p>

               <p><b>Flying Kick</b> [two-actions] Chea launches herself at a foe. She makes a Leap or attempts a High Jump or Long Jump. At the end of the jump, if she’s adjacent to a foe, she can immediately Strike that foe with an unarmed attack, even if the foe is in midair. She falls to the ground after the Strike. If the distance she falls is no more than the height of her jump, Chea lands upright and takes no damage.</p> 
               <p><b>Pack Tactics</b> If an enemy is within reach of Chea and at least two of her allies, that enemy is flat-footed against Chea.</p> 
               <p><b>Powerful Fists</b> Chea’s fist Strikes are treated as cold iron and silver and don’t take penalties when making lethal attacks.</p> 
               <h4>Plot Hooks</h4> 
               <p>Game Masters may consider the following plot hooks as a means of integrating Chea into any Pathfinder Second Edition game.</p> 
               <ul> 
                <li>Chea seeks out the heroes in hopes of learning a new fighting technique to give her a further edge in combat. She’s willing to share an aspect of her training in return.</li> 
                <li>As the heroes leave a dungeon, some ruins, or another adventuring site, Chea makes her presence known. She challenges the heroes to a fight, believing them to be Pathfinders.</li> 
                <li>A whisper on the wind guides the heroes to Chea. The monk notes that she’s received a message from her god about the whereabouts of a gem that holds another elemental lord. Chea believes it is her fate, and the heroes’, to rescue the trapped god.</li> 
               </ul> 
               <h4>About Beastkin</h4> 
               <p>Beastkin is a blanket term for any person who has gained the ability to partially or fully transform into an animal through any number of means, while maintaining a balance with their humanoid side. Beastkin might have a lineage that traces directly to werecreature parents. Other beastkin might have received their abilities from a deity or even as a result of polymorph magic. Regardless of their origin, a beastkin is tied to a particular animal, such as bat, eagle, shark, spider, tyrannosaurus, wasp, or wolf. This animal is known as the beastkin’s inherent animal. Beastkin feats allow a beastkin to further tap into their animalistic connection and gain new senses, the ability to fly or swim like their inherent animal, or even fully transform into that animal in combat. Beastkin is a rare versatile heritage and you can learn all about it when <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq026k5?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Ancestry-Guide">Lost Omens Ancestry Guide</a> releases on February 24th!</p>

               <h3>Pathfinder:</h3> 
               <p>For February we have an impressive slew of three scenarios on the release docket! First off, the PCs venture into the borders of Oprak to negotiate an agreement with the new hobgoblin nation in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq026nx?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-212-Snakes-in-the-Grass">Pathfinder Society #2–12: Snakes in the Grass</a> by Lysle Kapp. Then in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq026ny?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-213-A-Gilded-Test">Pathfinder Society #2–13: A Gilded Test</a> by Kalervo Oikarinen, a group of Pathfinders gets to the bottom of a growing threat in the Taldan capital of Oppara. Finally in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq026nz?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-214-Lost-in-Flames">Pathfinder Society #2–14: Lost in Flames</a> by Dennis Muldoon, the PCs continue to explore the depths of Iobaria in order to stop an ancient cyclops ritual that could spell disaster for the region!</p>

Last week we looked at the set’s starships, including three vesk models, so let’s look at some of the creatures from the Veskarium you can find in the set.</p> 
               <p>The Pahtra Stalker we revealed <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shk5?Set-Course-For-Planets-of-Peril#discuss"></a> makes its home on Vesk-6, while the helpful Skittermander (Small common) and the decidedly less helpful Stridermander (Medium uncommon) hail from Vesk-3. Skittermanders are known for their bright colors, and we knew we couldn’t get away with making just one. But the set only had so many slots and we didn’t want to take up too many of them with a single alien species, even one as popular as skittermanders. The solution, at least for now, is in alternate-paint promos, of which we made two. We’ll have more information in the future about how you can get your six hands on these little guys. In future sets, if we have alternate-paint figures built into the main set, skittermanders will likely make a reappearance there. </p>

               <p>While the Veskarium was initially at odds with the peoples of the Pact Worlds, the two warring star systems had to put their differences aside to face an enemy that threatened both of them: the Swarm! Perfect for use in the <a href="https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventures/adventurePath/attackOfTheSwarm">Attack of the Swarm! Adventure Path</a>, the three Swarm figures in Planets of Peril are sure to be the buzz of any playgroup.

               <p>Since most of the remaining aliens in the set call the Pact Worlds home (and thus would make an excellent theme to explore next week), let’s look at some of the aliens from other parts of the galaxy you’ll find in <em>Planets of Peril</em>, as you might encounter them on a journey across the galaxy. </p> 
               <p>First is the Jinsul Warrior (Medium common), which Starfinder Society players should recognize immediately (and which I won’t say much more about to avoid spoilers for past Starfinder Society plots). And since you’re not likely to get to the jinsuls’ home without going through the Drift, how about a Garaggakal (Medium rare), an outsider native to the hyperspace plane? Along the way, you might need to deal with an infestation of Electrovores (Small common), for which you consult an Orashu Headteacher (Medium uncommon) for advice, and ultimately employ an Uplifted Bear (Large uncommon) to handle them with brute force. Sadly, when you emerge from the Drift, you find the wreckage of another starship, its crew exposed to the vacuum of space and now haunting the area as dread Nihili (Medium common).</p>

           <p itemprop="description"><em>Sixteen point five two eight… move the seven</em>… Taihei tried to hold the quantities in his head, but they jittered and danced. No matter, he could manage. He dipped a brush into his inkstone and found a patch on the back of his right wrist where a cluster of silver dots raised in precise intervals against his golden skin, counted off ten dots, drew lines on either side, and covered seven dots with ink. <em>Leaving three. Now… what was the trajectory coefficient again…</em> he felt for a second like the answer was close, before the chirping of bell crickets pierced the tearoom-turned-study. </p>

               <p itemprop="description"><em>Sixteen point five two eight… move the seven</em>… Taihei tried to hold the quantities in his head, but they jittered and danced. No matter, he could manage. He dipped a brush into his inkstone and found a patch on the back of his right wrist where a cluster of silver dots raised in precise intervals against his golden skin, counted off ten dots, drew lines on either side, and covered seven dots with ink. <em>Leaving three. Now… what was the trajectory coefficient again…</em> he felt for a second like the answer was close, before the chirping of bell crickets pierced the tearoom-turned-study. </p> 
               <p>The remainders and decimals and factors scattered immediately. Taihei groaned, crumpled his sheet of paper, and threw it to join its fellows in the corner. As a distant chime rang, he retrieved a heavily notched metal rod from his writing case and made a small cut in it to mark the time before going to wash off in a basin by the door. <em>Another hour, another year.</em></p> 
               <p>The entrance examination for the College of Celestial Study would come in a few months with the snows, and Taihei couldn’t come back empty-handed <em>again</em>—he’d failed six times already, and this was getting embarrassing. <em>You wouldn’t even use half these formulas in the field, we have counting boards and number familiars for that.</em> Taihei just wanted to peer within a star, to chart the comets as they flowed through the sky, but he’d be earthbound forever if he couldn’t get into the program first. </p> 
               <p>Taihei allowed himself a moment to find his favorite constellations before getting back to study, but he couldn’t see a thing through the neighbor’s persimmon trees, which seemed to almost be mocking him—they’d shot up sometime when he wasn’t looking, sealing off the courtyard in a riot of red leaves and orange fruit. It made for a picturesque sight at least: persimmons, courtyard, and harvest moon, even a small fox in frame near the koi pond. “Must be nice, to just be a fox. You don’t have to worry about trajectories or tests, do you?” </p> 
               <p>“I’ll have you know I have two degrees from the College myself, so I find I rarely have to worry anymore” the fox stated matter-of-factly. </p> 
               <p>He bowed to Taihei before striding forward on four legs, though only two remained by the time he reached the door as his form blurred and shifted to that of a wavy-haired elf man in a professor's robes and pleated trousers. “And once I’m done with you, you won’t have to either.”</p> 
               <p>“Taihei, remember to clean up before your new tutor arrives!” Taihei’s mother called from the house, unfortunately a hair too late to save him the embarrassment. Sheepishly, the student slid open the door and placed a cushion on the floor, but the man strode right past him, taking a seat on the edge of the table instead</p> 
               <p>“So, out with it, why can’t you seem to pass the exam? Shouldn’t you be able to just…” the professor appraised Taihei, noting a golden mote flickering off his arm,” I don’t know, <em>aphorite</em> this?”</p> 
               <p>Taihei seethed at the assumption that being born under the sign of Axis somehow granted immediate knowledge of trigonometry and calculus, though he remembered his manners and prevented the emotion from reaching his face. “I’m afraid that numbers are my weakest subject. I’m not sure how to understand what they all mean in the real world.”</p> 
               <p>“In that case,” the fox in elf shape coughed into a fist, and when he withdrew his hand, a curious crystal ball sat in it, glowing soft and blue, “we should simply hammer all possible test questions into you so thoroughly that you’ll pass the test even if you don’t understand.” He tapped the orb, which floated across the room to hover in front of Taihei. “Write down your answers to the following questions. Beginning immediately.” Before Taihei could voice his confusion at this novel teaching strategy, the orb began reciting:</p> <b>
                <ul> 
                 <li>“List the seventeen most common alchemical components of an extraplanar being in reverse alphabetical order of closest-affinity celestial body, beginning from Aucturn”</li> 
                 <li>“Compute trajectory of this model of a transiting comet with a fey toroid structure and…”</li> 
                 <li>“What is the average density of a sixth-order star, assuming Positive Energy gateways have mass according to Gyoen’s Third Theorem of…”</li> 
                </ul></b> 
               <p>Taihei was overwhelmed swiftly and ruthlessly. He began trying his best to answer the questions, but no sooner had he begun writing than his teacher cleared his throat. “Keep in mind that the exam is 258 questions, so you’ll need to average one question every 90 seconds.” </p> 
               <p>“Y-yes... of course, Professor.” Taihei desperately tried to rejoin his train of thought. The orb carried on:</p> <b>
                <ul> 
                 <li>“Solve for X to yield the minimum possible amount of teleportation inaccuracy given a conjurer using …”</li> 
                 <li>“If ten human ganzi assistants and one brilliant kitsune professor are each holding a planar tuning fork, then…”</li> 
                </ul></b> 
               <p><em>Wait, wha—</em></p> 
               <p>“You know,” the professor interrupted again, “What if you just found a way to visualize the problems? Or like a feeling or something. Why, I used to be terrible at changing forms, but look at me now!” The professor waggled his long elven ears as they shifted back into those of a fox. “I just think of a sensation I connect with being a kitsune, like the feeling of grass under paw, and it comes to me.”</p> 
               <p>“That…” Taihei struggled to find a polite way to tell his teacher to please shut up, missing a question about two ships leaving Sakakabe (one at noon, the other at midnight) in the process, “That’s very helpful.”</p> <b>
                <ul> 
                 <li>“The aforementioned brilliant kitsune professor is planning a three-day planar expedition. How much fried tofu should his students gift him to ensure his rations are…”</li> 
                </ul></b>

               </div> 
               <p>“Oh, this one’s very important!” the professor noted most unhelpfully, and Taihei looked up to see he had fully resumed fox form and was now pacing across the desk, stepping in Taihei’s inkstone each time.</p> 
               <p>“Professor, you’re tracking paw prints on my practice tests,” Taihei pleaded, on his very last nerve.</p> <b>
                <ul> 
                 <li>“Solve for X, where X is the number of years an aphorite who can’t perform basic calculations without scribbling on his arms will attempt the entrance exam before…”</li> 
                </ul></b> 
               <p>“Okay, that does it!” Taihei snatched the orb from the air and ran to the door. Looking out into the courtyard, he spied a nest under the eave of the neighbors’ estate, recently abandoned by migrating swallows. In that moment, he wanted nothing more than to throw the orb into the nest, but those blasted trees were in the way and he didn’t have a clear shot. </p> 
               <p>No matter. He could manage.</p> 
               <p>Taihei’s eyes darted around the courtyard, taking in angles and forces. He felt his mind… not expand, exactly—the opposite. Connect. Point to point. Intention joined result. He flung the orb, feeling its complete trajectory even before it had left his hand. It skipped twice off the surface of the pond. It spun as it struck the tiles of the courtyard wall and flew high into the sky. And it danced in the autumn night as a breeze adjusted its path ever so slightly to the left, before it fell perfectly between the branches of the trees to land in the abandoned nest. </p> 
               <p>No sooner had it touched down than something strange happened. The trees that Taihei had tried so hard to avoid shimmered in the night air, dissolving into ghostly blue flames, and when Taihei had finished rubbing his eyes, they were gone and the sky was visible once more. Rather than the blue sphere, a roasted chestnut sat perfectly in the swallows’ nest. </p> 
               <p><em>Huh</em>. “The coefficient was zero point nine two,” Taihei said to himself, perfectly recalling the problem he had been working on earlier, every page in his textbook, and where he had forgotten one of his sandals that morning. The strange clarity left him as subtly as it arrived, but in its wake, he felt like he understood just a little bit more of the test than he had in years.</p> 
               <p>“Oh, very nice! It looks like you’re one of those students that learns better by doing. That’ll make the rest of this so much more fun.” </p> 
               <p>Taihei looked back at the desk to once more see an elf, eating from a bag of chestnuts. The professor flicked a wrist and the glowing orb reappeared in his hand, and as he absentmindedly tossed it into the air, nothing came back down. As he strode to the door and waved one of his tails from beneath his robes, illusory equations and vectors sprung into glowing existence around the courtyard, illuminating each phase of Taihei’s throw in precise and clear mathematical detail.</p> 
               <p>“I think,” Taihei said slowly, “you’re probably the worst teacher I’ve had.”</p> 
               <p>“You know, for some reason, I get that a lot,” the fox said in mock offense. He tossed a chestnut to Taihei before popping seven more in his mouth. “Now, do that again, and this time, let's go through the calculations, step by step.”</p>

I enjoy working in Human Resources and working at Paizo has given me the opportunity to work in a very diverse work environment. Working at Paizo has opened my eyes to the RPG world and how beneficial it can be to be part of such a community, especially during these uncertain times. These communities connect individuals and provide a means to still feel a part of something bigger than themselves while in isolation. I admire what we do here.</p>

               <h3>Travis “Rabbit” Lionel (he/him)</h3> 
               <p>Travis, circa 1994. Writer, gamer, black guy. Growing up, I was always told I wasn’t black enough or I was trying too hard to “act white” due to my hobbies and interests. I always loved games like Final Fantasy and became invested into tabletop games such as Magic: The Gathering and Pathfinder 1st Edition by the beginning of high school. However, I never let these things stop me from loving my blackness, my history and my hobbies no matter how far removed. Okay, that’s partially true; I did have some identity issues. Now, I’m in a position to not only show that black people can participate in these hobbies, but centralize themselves into the hobby as well. I was blessed with the opportunity to work with Paizo on Lost Omens: The Mwangi Expanse in 2020. I wanted this to be a chance for an African inspired setting to have a black voice on it as often we have so few chances to make African settings anymore than mud huts. I also wanted to show little black children that tabletop games and other hobbies are not the exclusive domains of white people and that everyone is welcome.</p> 
               <p>I love love love, 2nd Edition Pathfinder and I hope to continue playing and working on it in the future. In addition, you can find me on Twitch (<a href="https://twitch.tv/eightbitrabbits" target="_blank">https://twitch.tv/eightbitrabbits</a>) giving lots of opinions about games of both the tabletop and video variety here.</p>

               <h3>Erin Roberts (she/her)</h3> 
               <p>I'm a new(ish) freelancer for Paizo, but I have been a writer for some time, telling stories of impossible magic, maybe-one-day technology, and all-too-real things that go bump in the night (feel free to check me out on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/nirele" target="_blank">@nirele</a>). I am also a child (and current resident) of East Coast cities like New York and DC, with roots in the Deep South and Panama, who grew up in a family that ensured that the lessons and pride and continued journey of Black history were a fundamental part of who I am.</p> 
               <p>One of the reasons that I enjoy writing so much is that I love to tell a good story, but also that I love to think about the story beneath the story, the iceberg that the tales we spin are only the very tip of. After all, even the silliest, most ridiculously fluffy pieces of creative work teach you a little something, from who gets to shape the world to what places make interesting backdrops to which stories are worth telling. Part of why I love my creative work is that I have the opportunity to bring who I am to the page, to add the people and places and stories that I know from my experience as a Black woman to the undercurrents of the collective tale we’re telling, and to lift up the power of community, the fight against injustice, the distinction between race, culture, and destiny, and the deep importance of collective joy.</p> 
               <br> 
               <h3>Isis Wozniakowska (she/her)</h3> 
               <p>I’m one of Paizo’s newer freelancers. I’ve written for the upcoming Secrets of Magic book and my first Starfinder scenario, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027ms?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-321-Frozen-Ambitions-Renewals-Blight">#3-21: Frozen Ambitions: Renewal's Blight</a>, was just announced. I’ve been involved with Organized Play off and on for five years, but I’ve really become a more active member within the past two. I also both play and GM Paizo APs and adventures regularly. You might have even heard me in the most recent Starfinder Society special voicing Luwazi Elsebo, a role which I’d be happy to reprise anytime (wink wink).</p> 
               <p>I’m the daughter of a Black woman and a Polish immigrant man. My mother is a Blues musician, and a former belly dancer, which ended up giving me a Black music and musical history education in my childhood. She has also always been a major science fiction and superhero movie nerd. She and her siblings loved watching Star Trek as kids and seeing a Black woman like Uhura on screen each week inspired all of them.</p> 
               <p>The first time I showed my mother a picture of a Black elf in one of my Pathfinder books she got so excited that she bought elf ears for herself for Halloween because she’d never seen a classic fantasy race that looked like her.

               <h4>Urok, Kobold Infiltrator</h4> 
               <p>When the Yioxat tribe of kobolds was subjugated by a local devil, its members feared that their children might be corrupted by their parents' unwilling agreements with Hell. Yet when Urok cracked open his shell, his caretakers were shocked to see the kobold hatchling had unique gold and silver scales, unlike even the scales of a metallic kobold. Though his soul was unclaimed by the forces of evil, Urok grew up arrogant and overbearing, enforcing the strict order that the devil imposed on his tribe. He was quick to realize that his fellows weren't carrying out their tasks as efficiently as they could be, and his efforts to organize his tribe more effectively always seemed to fail. It was only after investigating that he realized how much the Yioxats were deliberately undermining his efforts, as they despised their devil overlord, and despised Urok by association.</p> 
               <p>Though he was heavily tempted to double down on his attempts to control, Urok instead fled, hiding in the wilderness as he tried to make sense of his life until this point. It was there that a Yioxat dragon sorcerer found him. The sorcerer explained that the Yioxat tribe had warded Urok's egg against evil influence before he was born, to protect him from the risk of Hell claiming his soul. Realizing that he had repaid his people's kindness with oppression, Urok decided to serve the law by returning sovereignty to his tribe. Though he doesn't want to approach his fellows just yet, he keeps watch over them, looking for an opportunity to kill the devil and free his family. However, this has also resulted in Urok clashing with well-meaning adventurers who seek to destroy the Yioxat tribe without realizing the kobolds are unwilling servants.</p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/b3bdca0b-06e2-4e62-9c8c-b6449bf95acb/021221_urok.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/b3bdca0b-06e2-4e62-9c8c-b6449bf95acb/021221_urok.jpg" align="left" width="350" style="padding: 10px;" alt=": A small kobold is covered in brilliant golden scales.

               <p><b>Perception</b> +18; darkvision, low-light vision<br> <b>Languages</b> Aklo, Common, Draconic, Infernal, Undercommon, Utopian<br> <b>Skills</b> Acrobatics +20, Arcana +20, Athletics +13, Deception +16, Devil Lore +20, Diplomacy +16 Nature +16, Intimidation +16 Occultism +20, Religion +16, Society +20, Stealth +20, Survival +16, Thievery +20, Yioxat Tribe Lore +20<br> <b>Str</b> +0, <b>Dex</b> +4, <b>Con</b> +0, <b>Int</b> +4, <b>Wis</b> +2, <b>Cha</b> +2<br> <b>Items</b> <em>+1 striking returning dagger</em><br> <b>AC</b> 27; <b>Fort</b> +15, <b>Ref</b> +21, <b>Will</b> +18<br> <b>HP</b> 140</p> 
               <p><b>Preemptive Reconfiguration</b> [reaction] <b>Frequency</b> once per day; <b>Trigger </b>Urok would take bludgeoning piercing, or slashing damage; <b>Effect</b> Urok’s body anticipates the blow and the impact area briefly reorganizes into a strengthened tissue lattice that blunts the attack. He gains resistance 9 against the triggering damage type, which applies against the triggering damage</p> 
               <p>Urok can expend his daily use of Crystalline Dust when using this reaction. If he does, his daily use of Preemptive Reconfiguration isn’t expended and he can use it a second time.</p> 
               <p><b>Speed</b> 25 feet</p> 
               <p><b>Melee</b> [one-action] dagger +19 (agile, finesse, versatile S), <b>Damage</b> 2d4+8 piercing</p> 
               <p><b>Ranged</b> [one-action] dagger +19 (agile, finesse, thrown 10 feet, versatile S), <b>Damage</b> 2d4+8 piercing</p> 
               <p><b>Crystalline Dust</b> [two-actions] <b>Frequency</b> once per day; <b>Effect</b> Urok disperses the crystalline motes coating his body as a haze. He becomes concealed, though he can’t use this concealment to Hide or Sneak. The motes stay within an inch of his skin, move with you, and last for 4 rounds.</p> 
               <p><b>Draconic Exemplar</b> green dragon</p> 
               <p><b>Kobold Breath</b> [two-actions] (arcane, evocation, poison) Urok breathes a poisonous mist that deals 5d4 poison damage in a 15-foot cone (DC 25 basic Fortitude save). He can’t use Kobold Breath again for 1d4 rounds. </p> 
               <p><b>Mastermind</b> If Urok successfully identifies a creature using Recall Knowledge, that creature is flat-footed against his attacks until the start of his next turn; if he critically succeeds, it’s flat-footed against his attacks for 1 minute.</p> 
               <p><b>Skirmish Strike</b> [one-action] <b>Frequency</b> once per round; <b>Effect</b> Urok either Steps and then Strike, or Strikes and then Steps.</p> 
               <p><b>Sneak Attack</b> Urok’s Strikes deal an additional 2d6 precision damage to flat‑footed creatures.</p> 
               <h4>Plot Hooks</h4> 
               <p>Game Masters may consider the following plot hooks as a means of integrating Urok into any Pathfinder Second Edition game.</p> 
               <ul> 
                <li>Urok arrives in the same town as the heroes. He is met with unwelcoming glances and even fear from the townsfolk. The pleading kobold asks anyone who will listen that he is in need of cold iron weapons to slay the devil that terrorizes his kin.</li> 
                <li>A local noble tasks the heroes with clearing the Yioxat kobold tribe from the nearby wilderness. As they approach the tribe, Urok makes himself known and attempts to force the heroes away.</li> 
                <li>A fleeing Urok runs into the heroes as they are travelling. He is holding a large egg and shoves it into the heroes’ hands. He explains the egg has been warded and needs to be kept away from evil eyes before he runs away.</li> 
               </ul> 
               <h4>About Aphorites</h4> 
               <p>Aphorites were first forged by axiomites to serve as liaisons between their lawful progenitors and frustratingly unpredictable mortal allies.

                <p><em>Kia Ora from Aotearoa, the Land of the Long White Cloud, home of Hobbiton, Xena, and both of the Conchords, my home: New Zealand! I am Paul Trani, one of the Venture Captains of this exquisite place, and just like you, I have seen my role-playing game practice change dramatically this past year, in both how and why I game. With respect to the latter, I am so grateful for the Organized Play (OP) community, both in-person and virtual, for preserving (slightly) my sanity, and when the opportunity to give back came around, I critically failed my Will save. On purpose. </em></p><em> <p>And so I find myself the chairperson of the Onboarding Task Force, a newly-created volunteer group of venture officers working to help new players discover the world of Pathfinder Society (PFS) and wow! am I both excited and humbled by the talented people that populate this group. The taskforce team is made up of Daniel Baker, Douglas Hahn, Katrina Hennessy, Kevin Baumann, Kristin Wilhite, Michael VonHasseln, Peter Nalepa, Nicole Heits, Kiela Butson, Kara Kramer-Rapp, Dustin Knight, and Joel Hager.</p> <p>But Paul, you ask, doesn’t New Zealand have an official wizard? Yes, he lives in Christchurch - you can look it up, but I’d like to tell you about what the Onboarding Task Force has been doing in the course of the past four months</p> <p>We started work with a specific request - reduce the barriers to entry for new players. In the current mostly-digital world, that translated to finding a way to transition the chronicle sheets to allow for treasure and scenario rewards to be tracked differently. We created a format that can be used either physically or electronically and we’re continuing to look at more ways that this can be tracked even more simply. You can find the <a href="https://www.orgplayfoundation.org/join/new-players-pop/" target="_blank">tracking tools here</a>.</p> <p>Since that time, we’ve been asked to do a few more things. We’ve been working extra hard on helping you to take characters from that cool new <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfinder/beginnerbox">Pathfinder Beginner Box</a> that you or a loved one got for Christmas and played all the way through. We’re publishing a guide that will help transition characters built with Beginner Box rules into full-fledged Pathfinder Society Characters. You can find the guide here: <a href="https://www.orgplayfoundation.org/pf2bb/" target="_blank">Beginner Box conversion guide</a>.</p> <p>We’ve got lots more in the pipeline that we’re working on, which will post to the Organized Play Foundation website when finished. We’re really excited about our new projects and can’t wait to show them to you. </p> <p>Our team is here to help the community get involved in organized play. Got a suggestion? We’re always open to new ideas. You can send them to me at <u>we.be.dunedinpfs@gmail.com</u>. </p> <p>It’s a pleasure to be helping bring the new generation of Golarionites to the Starstone, as it were, and we on the Onboarding Team wish you all the natural 20s that are coming to you. </p> </em>
                <p><em>Cheers!</em></p>

               <p><b>Logan Harper, Customer Service</b> – Hi! I’m Logan (she/her). I’m a bit of a hobbit who you can usually find curled up with my pups watching movies.

Feel free to follow me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/LoganHarper_" target="_blank">@LoganHarper_</a></p> 
               <p><b>Kyle Hunter, Art Director</b> (November) (he/him) – After about 15 years, I’m back! I was part of the original WotC Periodicals crew that split off to form Paizo. Even stranger, I worked with Sarah and Sonja on Nintendo Power in the 1990s! Wrote and drew the comic Downer in the later days of Dungeon Magazine. In addition to designing the Paizo logo, I created the droid manufacturing logos for Star Wars.</p>

When I’m not playing games, I’m probably outside. I love the great outdoors—cycling, hiking, and rock climbing are some of my favorite activities. I sometimes ramble about various topics on Twitter, <a href="https://twitter.com/jenjski" target="_blank">@jenjski</a>. See you in space!</p>

               <p><b>Lee Rucker, Project Coordinator</b> – Hello! I’m Lee (they/them). When I’m not wrangling projects, I mostly spend my time playing games (all kinds), hanging with friends (digitally these days), and reading. I hope to utilize my skills in organizing, process improvement, and planning to help make everyone’s lives less stressful here. </p> 
               <p><b>Levi Steadman, Tech</b> – Hello, I’m Levi (he/him). I’m a Michigander who has been playing Pathfinder for half his life adjusting to my new life here in the PNW. I’ve joined the team to help with the QA process for the website and automated some of the monotonous QA tasks that tend to slow things down. When I’m not doing my day job or playing Pathfinder I’m almost always playing MMOs with my wife and our friends back in Michigan.</p>

               <p>When I’m not editing, I enjoy learning about nature, cross-stitching, watching horror movies, and petting my dog.

               <p>Most Paizo employees continue to work from home and we have no return date scheduled. Many of us have yet to meet face-to-face, but we have Happy Hours every other Friday hosted by Devinne Caples, our HR Generalist. This also means our Customer Service team is unable to take calls directly in the office they continue to work via email, the forums, and the main Paizo voicemail box. We thank you for your support, patience, and patronage. </p>

              <blockquote> 
               <p itemprop="description">The creature ripped out the man’s throat with its claws, blood spraying across the leaf-littered forest floor. Its furry bulk pinned the body to the ground. Lips pulled back from razor-sharp teeth as a low, ripsaw growl rumbled deep in the thing’s throat.</p> 
               <p>Leaning close, the lupine head sniffed at its victim’s pulsing neck. Then the beast threw back its head, spine arching. Its shrill howl split the chill, nighttime air.</p> 
               <p>“AWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!” </p> 
               <p>“Archie? Archie, stop! Archibol Frigasson the Third!”</p> 
               <p>The creature’s howl stopped abruptly. It blinked, looking around in confusion.</p> 
               <p>“Goria... what?” </p> 
               <p>“Stop. There could be more bandits, you little twit. Calm down.”</p> 
               <p>Archie cleared his throat. “Ah. Of course. My apologies. I quite got carried away.”</p> 
               <p>Archibol rose carefully to his feet. He was not particularly tall, but his broad shoulders and thick arms gave him a hulking quality. His gray fur shone almost white in the light of the full moon. For a moment, he looked down on his blood-soaked hands with wonder, then blinked. He crouched and pulled at the dead man’s cloak, gathering enough fabric to start meticulously cleaning his claws and fur.</p> 
               <p>“Archie? We good?” Goria asked, her voice like gravel rolling around in a dry bucket. The blades of her daggers flashed as she twirled and pushed them into scabbards at her hips. Although the woman was both preternaturally quick and strong, she looked neither. Long, stitched scars zig-zagged everywhere across her flabby skin. It was as if someone had patched Goria together from dozens of long-dead, mismatched bodies. </p> 
               <p>Which, of course, is precisely what Archibol’s mad father had done, years before he had turned to polymorph experiments upon his only son. The two oddities had clung to each other ever since their escape.</p> 
               <p>“Of course, big sister, of course. Heh. Nothing to fear. Merely lost in the moment.”</p> 
               <p>Goria watched him with a milky, unblinking stare. An awkward moment of silence passed.</p> 
               <p>The wolf-man cleared his throat again. “Right. Everyone accounted for, then? Where’s our lovely oracle?”</p> 
               <p>“I’m here, Archibol!”</p> 
               <p>He could smell her before she emerged from the shadows, the scent of an open grave. Normally, Ashka Midnighter was a young, doe-eyed kayal—a shadow person—her pale skin and white hair seeming as if all color had drained from her and giving her an exotic beauty. Now, however, her cheeks were sunken, her perfect smooth skin marred by rot. She still moved gracefully, though, skipping gleefully through branches and leaves and hardly making a sound.</p> 
               <p>“Ah, splendid. I say, Ashka. Do these oracular powers of yours hurt you when they desiccate your body so?”</p> 
               <p>Her cracked lips split into a wide grin. “Of course not! Oh, I feel a bit tired, but I’m fine. Ready for more adventure!” She hopped on one foot and thrust a fist into the air. </p> 
               <p>“Hrmph. As my new ward, my dear, I must insist we do some investigation to determine any long-term negative effects from putting your body through such an ordeal.”</p> 
               <p>Ashka looked down at her exposed, decaying arms with glowing, white eyes. “It’s just the mystery of the bones, Archibol. I get glimpses into death, and death reaches back out to me. But it’s temporary, silly. Don’t worry.”</p> 
               <p>“Still, data is knowledge, eh? I would be comforted with some empiricism behind your changes. For now, though,” he grunted as he stood, hands cleaned. “We appear to have more pressing concerns.”</p> 
               <p>The three of them looked around the clearing, dappled by moonlight. </p> 
               <p>A dozen bodies lay scattered. </p> 
               <p>“What a simply preposterous disaster,” Archibol grunted. “Alright, let us begin with the facts.”</p> 
               <p>“Blast it, Archie...” Goria growled.</p> 
               <p>“How long have you known me? We must always begin with the facts.”</p> 
               <p>She rolled her patchwork eyes but did not argue.</p> 
               <p>“Now,” he began reciting, as if giving a university lecture, one clawed finger raised. “Nobleman Cammack Guthor’s caravan left Caliphas at dusk this evening, headed to a remote holiday estate. The nobleman traveled with,” Archibol’s eyes roamed the clearing. “Two servants, one carriage driver, and... let’s see, one, no, two armed guards. The carriage was led off the road to this clearing, where Guthor and his entire party were slain. Their rather impressive store of valuables has been gathered in sacks.”</p> 
               <p>Archibol began moving, stepping gingerly between corpses.</p> 
               <p>“When we arrived, we found four men and two women dressed in matching cloaks and leather armor, all armed, picking through the sacks. Each wore a red mask painted with the visage of...” he leaned down and fingered one of the wooden masks. Its bulbous nose and leering smile might have been comical in a different setting. </p> 
               <p>Ashka appeared silently at his shoulder. “Ooo! I know! Devil masks!” she clapped enthusiastically. “Like from a carnival.”</p> 
               <p>Archibol nodded once. “Devils, yes. Some fanciful conceit in pursuit of notoriety, I suppose. And calling themselves the Tricksters! As if they were some famous band of villains instead of a two-copper band of thugs.”</p> 
               <p>Goria nudged one of the bandits disdainfully with a boot. “Trying to sneak wearing red in a forest. Idiots.” </p> 
               <p>Archibol grunted. “Indeed. Alright, we have six dead victims, including our Ustalavic nobleman. However, thanks to us, we also have six dead Tricksters.” He scratched at his chin, lost for a moment in thought. “I say! How long do you suppose it would take to waylay the carriage, lead it here, kill everyone, and pick through their belongings?”</p> 
               <p>Goria shrugged one shoulder. “Hour?”</p> 
               <p>Archibol looked up to the full moon. “And yet it’s before midnight. Blast! The scroll we intercepted correctly identified Guthor as the target of the ambush, but why did the Tricksters strike early? We should have left one of the bandits alive for questioning.”</p> 
               <p>“Yes,” Goria frowned, the stitches on one cheek going taut. She looked at him pointedly. “We definitely should have.”</p> 
               <p>Archibol avoided her gaze. “Well, then. I propose we begin examining how the Tricksters arrived at the ambush point. Perhaps we can track them back to—” </p> 
               <p>Someone nearby groaned.</p> 
               <p>No sooner had Archibol’s wolf-like ears flicked at the sound, than he was bounding across the clearing to a low bush. Goria followed protectively close behind. </p> 
               <p>Both pairs of eyes looked down on an older, pale-skinned human man in an ornate breastplate, his legs tangled in the bush and the rest sprawled out of sight of the clearing. A dented helm lay nearby. </p>

               </div> 
               <p>“Ho ho!” Archibol exclaimed. “We have ourselves a thirteenth! One of Guthor’s guardsmen, it seems. My dear fellow, it looks as if you’ve taken quite a blow to the head. Please allow me to help you up. We have a number of questions as we pursue those who waylaid you.”</p> 
               <p>The man groaned again and rolled onto his back. He blinked once, twice.</p> 
               <p>“Yeaargh!” the man squealed. “Werewolf!”</p> 
               <p>“Ah,” Archibol chuckled. “Honest mistake. Actually, you see, I am—”</p> 
               <p>The guard’s wild eyes swiveled to Goria. “M-monster!”</p> 
               <p>“Now listen here, good fellow. That’s hardly fair,” Archibol frowned. “I believe you’ve got the wrong—”</p> 
               <p>Ashka’s grave smell washed over them as she approached. The man yelped, “Zombie!” before fainting dead away.</p> 
               <p>“Bother,” Archibol sighed. “Not again.”</p>

               <p>We have a stream this Friday (2/12) from 4:15 PM - 6 PM Eastern on our Twitch (<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/levelup_ttv" target="_blank">twitch.tv/levelup_ttv</a>) where Shawn, our Corporate Manager and one of the leads on this project, will be building out characters from all sorts of systems to show you how to build your character's dice set! </p> 
               <p>We wanted to also announce that for our final days we will be unlocking ALL color combinations and five more spell glyphic designs we had yet to unlock! We couldn't bring ourselves to keep them from you as you're all near and dear to us as our first group of backers and hope you'll follow us in our journey forward. </p>

               <p>We have a huge announcement or three coming soon but let's focus on what we have at hand. At the completion of the campaign we must wait 14 days before the Backerkit can be opened to you. As soon as we can, we will have that available to you and we will be closing it 14 days after opening it. There is a possibility of extending if we have a significant number of backers that have yet to pledge, but we are trying to turn this around as fast as possible and are simply waiting for the orders to be processed to get started. Hopefully, all of this preparation amounts to everybody getting their dice much earlier than expected, but let's temper our expectations just in case of, you know, another worldwide pandemic or something happening. </p> 
               <p>We hope you have the best of times until we can all get together again at conventions and the like!</p>

              <blockquote> 
               <p itemprop="description">The <em>Pathfinder</em> core rules contain 289 spells by our count. <em>Savage World Adventure Edition</em> includes 54 powers. When it came time to figure out how to translate the expansive, robust <em>Pathfinder</em> magic system to work in the smaller, dynamic <em>Savage Worlds</em> power system, we had to boil everything down to their core.</p> 
               <p>As designers, one of the most useful tools we have is constraining the problem. When you’re staring down the barrel of holding nearly three hundred spells in your head all at once to figure out how to combine and represent them, it’s too much for anyone to handle. But if we categorize these items and constrain them to a pre-defined structure, they’re much more manageable.</p> 
               <p>What do spells in Pathfinder accomplish? In general terms, we can assign all Pathfinder spells up to three of the following trait categories (in order of how core that trait is to the spell) and effectively summarize what they do: </p> 
               <ul> 
                <li>Deal Damage</li> 
                <li>Deal Damage in an Area</li> 
                <li>Heal</li> 
                <li>Heal in an Area</li> 
                <li>Buff an Ally</li> 
                <li>Buff Allies in an Area</li> 
                <li>Debuff an Enemy</li> 
                <li>Debuff Enemies in an Area</li> 
                <li>Remove an Effect</li> 
                <li>Remove Effects in an Area</li> 
                <li>Cause a Social Effect</li> 
                <li>Cause Social Effects in an Area</li> 
                <li>Mimic the Usage of a Skill</li> 
                <li>An Impossible Effect </li> 
               </ul> 
               <p>Now that we’ve got everything grouped, we can organize the spells into buckets. If we look at the spells that “Deal Damage” or “Deal Damage in an Area,” the list trims down to 31 spells:</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/5105298d-b7be-4b01-bf49-bad24c45829a/020921_31Damage Spells.JPG"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/5105298d-b7be-4b01-bf49-bad24c45829a/020921_31Damage Spells.JPG" width="80%" hspace="5" alt="A list of thirty-one Pathfinder spells in an excel spreadsheet that deal damage or damage in an area"></a>
                <p style="font-size: 13px;"></p>
               </div> 
               <p>That’s a lot less to think about all at once! We grouped both damage traits because we know that in <em>Savage Worlds</em>, our direct damage powers either damage everything in an area already (<em>blast, burst, &amp; damage field</em>) or have a way to hit multiple targets at once (<em>bolt</em>). Our next step is to figure out which of those spells we can reproduce the effect of using our existing powers.</p> 
               <p>We need to understand our toolset to finish our work, so let us digress for a moment and describe how powers work in <em>Savage Worlds</em>. Instead of having spell slots of different levels, you have a pool of Power Points. Each power has a listed cost you spend when you successfully activate that power (a roll of four or greater on your arcane skill). In addition to the base cost, most powers also have Power Modifiers that increase the power’s cost to give it extra effects. They also have trappings: the narrative description of how the power functions that the player defines when they gain the power.</p> 
               <p>For example, the bread-and-butter direct damage power in <em>Savage Worlds</em> is bolt. It costs one Power Point, shoots out at range, and deals a base of 2d6 damage. It also has the Damage Power Modifier that increases our base damage by 1d6. Remember, we don’t have hit points in <em>Savage Worlds</em>, so doing an extra d6 damage at any point is a pretty good damage bump.</p> 
               <p>With trappings alone, we can use bolt to mimic <em>call lightning, lightning bolt, magic missile</em>, and <em>scorching ray</em>. Magic missile has many additional rules that tie into Pathfinder’s specific systems, but otherwise is just like <em>bolt</em>; it’s a ranged attack that hits a target to deal damage.</p> 
               <p><em>Scorching ray</em> is more or less <em>bolt</em> with a fire trapping. Suppose we wanted to fire multiple rays in a single round. Instead of using the baked-in rays per four levels mechanic of <em>Pathfinder</em>, we’d leverage the Multi-Action economy of <em>Savage Worlds</em> to cast our fire-trapping <em>bolt</em> up to three times in a single round. And that’s before we use any new Power Modifiers from our work-in-progress <em>Fantasy Companion</em>. Like Onslaught, that lets us fire two <em>bolts</em> per activation. In the end, the list looked like this:</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/104b9458-4782-45d9-bfe6-f0735995debc/020921_SWADEVersions.JPG"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/104b9458-4782-45d9-bfe6-f0735995debc/020921_SWADEVersions.JPG" width="80%" hspace="5" alt="The list of Pathfinder spells from earlier with how you would cast those spells as powers in Savage Worlds.]"></a>
                <p style="font-size: 13px;"></p>
               </div> 
               <p><em>Cloudkill</em> is an excellent example of how a mechanically complex spell can be re-created in <em>Savage Worlds</em> using our Power Modifiers and trappings. It’s based on <em>damage field</em>, which deals 2d4 damage to everyone adjacent to the caster by default. Well, to start, <em>cloudkill</em> automatically kills creatures below three hit dice, kills creatures from four to six hit dice on a failed save, and deals constitution damage to anything with more than six hit dice.</p> 
               <p>In <em>Savage Worlds</em>, 2d4 isn’t going to wipe out a lot of folks outright, so let’s up the damage to 3d6 Heavy Damage using the new exalted Power Modifier, Greater Damage Field. Against most Extras (minor NPCs like most goblins that tend to die quickly), that’s going to be vicious, while our Wild Cards (player characters and tougher creatures) will have a chance to get out unharmed.</p> 
               <p>The next piece of the puzzle is the size of <em>cloudkill</em>. It’s a 20-ft. radius, 20 ft. high cloud. The Radius modifier expands our damage field to a Small Blast Template (that’s a 4-yard diameter in <em>Savage Worlds</em>, about 12 feet across). Well, that’s smaller than its <em>Pathfinder</em> cousin, so we can pause a moment and consider if <em>damage field</em> needs an edited version of Radius that lets us use a Large Blast Template (12 yards diameter, or 36 feet across). Given that taking damage every round is much more lethal in <em>Savage Worlds</em> than <em>Pathfinder</em>, probably say not. Even Wild Cards will start to wither and die if they’re in a 3d6 Heavy Damage field for a few turns, so constraining our <em>cloudkill</em> to a smaller size works better for our game.</p> 
               <p>Next, we need to address how <em>cloudkill</em> can be placed anywhere within 100 ft. + 10ft./level in <em>Pathfinder</em> and moves away from the caster at 10 feet per round. First, we must accept a difference in the presumption of scales between our two games. In <em>Savage Worlds</em>, we generally assume you use your powers within the scope of an encounter instead of at long distances, limiting the ranges of our powers. That said, by using Mobile we can let the caster move their <em>damage field</em> up to their arcane skill on each of their turns. That means we take the maximum number from their arcane skill die (anywhere from a d4 to a d12+#), and the cloud moves that far. That’s between 8 and 24 yards (24 to 72 feet). We trade a higher range for the cloud’s starting location for the ability to move it to a specific spot on each of our turns. On average, the two balance out so we can move on.</p> 
               <p>As Mike Barbeau (the chief designer on the <em>Rise of the Runelords</em> conversion) pointed out, one of the things GMs love to do with <em>cloudkill</em> is block line of sight for their players. Taking damage in a cloud is one thing; not finding your way out is another level of pain. To that end, we can use the universal modifier (these are available to almost every power in <em>Savage Worlds</em>) Shroud to mimic this effect. It doesn’t completely block line of sight in the same way, but given that the Savage <em>cloudkill</em> is more lethal to our player characters, that’s preferred.</p> 
               <p>We describe our <em>damage field</em> as a noxious, yellow cloud to assign its trapping, and we have our <em>Savage Worlds</em> version of <em>cloudkill</em> ready to <strike>murder</strike> encounter player characters everywhere! Sometimes, however, our existing toolkit isn’t large enough to encompass everything we want a power to do in <em>Pathfinder® for Savage Worlds</em>. A great example of this is <em>disintegrate</em>! It’s an iconic spell with an effect that doesn’t have a strong translation in the existing powers, so we get to have some fun and create something new. If we look at the other effects of <em>disintegrate</em>, we can see it fits mostly under <em>bolt</em>, so we can get away with just adding a new Power Modifier that looks like this:</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/a7344ccd-ca3d-4e75-a9c7-ab5061a5feb3/020921_Disintegrate.JPG"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/a7344ccd-ca3d-4e75-a9c7-ab5061a5feb3/020921_Disintegrate.JPG" width="80%" hspace="5" alt="The Power Modifier that makes a bolt disintegrate a target in Pathfinder® for Savage Worlds. Disintegrate (+2) If the bolt incapacitates a creature, it immediately dies, and its body disintegrates. If the target is an object, everything in a Small Blast Template disintegrates."></a>
                <p style="font-size: 13px;"></p>
               </div> 
               <p>By building spells using our existing tools, we can exemplify the breadth of expression our powers system allows and capture the expanse of <em>Pathfinder</em> spells in our game. When we encounter spells outside of our usual portfolio or too cool to resist making anew in <em>Savage Pathfinder</em>, we follow the existing principles behind our system to expand our powers and their modifiers to capture the spell’s essence.</p> 
               <p>Without a doubt, the category that resulted in the most new powers was the “An Impossible Effect.” This was the catch-all category for spells that had effects you couldn’t replicate without the usage of magic.</p> 
               <p>We don’t want to give too much away, but we grouped these spells to inspire some of our new powers for <em>Savage Pathfinder</em>:</p>

               <p>A handful of starship miniatures were produced a few years ago by Ninja Division and players seemed to like being able to get multiple ships around a single theme—specifically the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9ub5?Starfinder-Miniatures-Corpse-Fleet"><em>Eoxian Corpse Fleet</em></a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9ub4?Starfinder-Miniatures-Pact-Worlds-Fleet">Pact Worlds fleet</a>. So when it came time to pick the ships to include in Planets of Peril, we decided to do something similar, this time offering three Veskarium ship models. Here you can see the BMC Mauler, Norikama Dropship, and Vindicas Tyrant, which are uncommon, rare, and rare, respectively. (Note also that all starships, regardless of their size, are represented on a single hex, so they’re all on 1-inch bases.)</p>

               </div> 
               <p>We had originally included only these three starships in the set, in part because we weren’t sure what ratio of creatures to ships was right for the set. We knew that we didn’t want common starships, as most of the time a combat is between the PCs and only a few other combatants. Most GMs, we figured, would need just one copy of any given model.</p> 
               <p>Fastforward a few months, to when WizKids approached us about pulling some figures out of the set to release earlier as the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq024sv?Starfinder-Battles-Galactic-Heroes"><em>Galactic Heroes</em></a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq024su?Starfinder-Battles-Galactic-Villains"><em>Galactic Villains</em></a> blister packs. We now had to replace those figures, and used that opportunity to not only add a dozen creatures that didn’t make the initial cut (for what was, at the time, a 30-figure set), but also to add another two starships at the uncommon rarity. These, we knew, needed to be something that would be useful to GMs and players both (given their uncommon status) and applicable to the most possible adventures. Thus, we landed upon including the Starfinder Society’s Drake and Pegasus. Each ship was presented at a variety of tiers and were, at the time, the only two ships available to every Starfinder Society party. </p>

               <p>We hope folks find them useful and that we get the opportunity to include a Gorgon sometime down the road.</p> 
               <p>Next week, we’ll return to previews of the myriad aliens and monsters you’ll find in <em>Planets of Peril</em>, so strap on your jetpacks and recharge your laser rifles. Until then, Starfinders, be safe and roll 20s.</p>

               <p>PS - WizKids really went above and beyond with the promo images they provided to show off the set’s contents. These are final production models pulled from a retail case. Let us know in the comments what you think of these (compared to the renders we’ve shown in the past, or the photos of the miniatures on plain white backgrounds) and we’ll work with WizKids to perfect future blogs. Thanks for your feedback thus far, and we look forward to continue working with the community to best promote Pathfinder and Starfinder Battles.</p>

               <p>This encounter is Average difficulty for a group of PCs flying a tier-4 starship, but your PCs may be higher or lower in level. “False Flags over Castrovel” is an Easy encounter for 5th-level PCs, Challenging for 3rd-level PCs, Hard for 2nd-level PCs, and Epic for 1st-level PCs.</p> 
               <h3>False Flags over Castrovel — CR 2</h3> 
               <p>The player characters have just arrived in their starship at Castrovel and are on course to their landing destination when they receive a message over their ship’s comms</p> 
               <center>
                <hr width="70%">
               </center> 
               <p>“This is <em>Blue Talon 1</em>, ordering you to stand down. Repeat, this is the <em>Blue Talon 1</em>. Land for inspection. You must comply immediately.”</p> 
               <center>
                <hr width="70%">
               </center> 
               <p>The <em>Blue Talon 1</em> comes into view on the PCs’ sensors, along with an identical ship; they are single-seat interceptors. They transmit codes identifying the craft as the <em>Blue Talon 1</em> and <em>Blue Talon 2</em> and indicating they are a patrol squadron for the Pact Worlds defensive fleet. A PC who succeeds at a DC 19 Sense Motive check can tell that the interceptors are moving to attack. A PC who succeeds at a DC 21 Computers or Profession (bounty hunter or smuggler) check recognizes that the codes are fake. A PC who succeeds by 5 or more notices the codes were altered to conceal that the ships are flagged as “AWOL.”</p> 
               <p> The <em>Blue Talons</em> aim to make the PCs hesitate long enough for the interceptors to close in before the PCs understand their hostile intentions. The pilots do not respond to any attempts to communicate and fight until the PCs’ ship is disabled.</p> 
               <p><b>Starship Combat</b>: The PCs’ starship begins three hexes away from a short edge of the map. The <em>Blue Talons</em> enter the map from the long edge. In battle, the Blue Talons use their fast speed to harry the PCs with hit-and-run tactics. When the PCs move to pursue one ship, the other moves to attack from another direction.</p> 
               <p><b>Hazard</b>: This combat occurs in the third-highest layer of Castrovel’s atmosphere. Castrovel has a normal atmosphere, so a starship can move up to 3 hexes without taking damage each round. A starship takes Hull Point damage to its forward quadrant equal to the starship’s tier × 2 for every hex moved each round beyond 3. If a <em>Blue Talon</em> has 50% or more Hull Points remaining, its pilot accepts this damage if they can gain an advantageous position. Furthermore, a storm coming in over the ocean is a moderate obfuscation hazard for any ship flying over the water. This imposes a –2 penalty on gunnery and Piloting checks, as well as Computers checks that use a starship’s sensors.</p>

Just like the Character Options page, this update both refreshes the look of the pages and will make it easier for the Organized Play team to publish content. We’re still tweaking these pages, so you may see some changes in how the content is organized, but if you have feedback, let us know! We’ve kept the <a href="https://paizo.com/organizedplay/legacy/faq">Pathfinder Society (first edition) pages</a> in the legacy format.</p> 
               <p>Eagle-eyed players will notice that the Pathfinder Society FAQ page currently contains the full text of a number of boons. You’ve been asking for a place to view the full text of boons before buying them, and now we’ve got one! Any boon that is more complicated than its short description will have its text published on this page. Boons that unlock ancestries or similarly self-evident boons will not have their text published. </p> 
               <p>The FAQ page also contains the full text of our Year 2 Chronicle Boons. As we discussed in <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shk2?Pathfinder-Society-Digitization-Update">last week’s blog</a>, there is an issue where GMs cannot download these boons after running the game, so we’re pleased to offer this workaround. <b>Any GM with a chronicle sheet for running a Year 2 scenario with a boon attached can use the full text as published on the FAQ page instead of downloading the boon</b>. Once the bug is fixed, these boons will be removed from the FAQ page to avoid spoilers.</p> 
               <h2>Fame</h2> 
               <p>Last week, we updated the community regarding our <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shk2?Pathfinder-Society-Digitization-Update">Pathfinder Society digitization efforts</a>. At this point, Fame is no longer a spendable currency and we are not tracking it in any way. Reputation still exists and unlocks benefits for characters via the Achievement Point system on your “My Organized Play” page. You can see your current Reputation with the factions (note, it is called Fame on the webpage in a holdover from Pathfinder Society (first edition), which is something we have queued to fix.)</p> 
               <h2>Sanctioning</h2> 
               <p>We caught up on some of the outstanding tasks, as well as kept up with our goal of day one sanctioning. Last month, we finished up <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq026k1?Pathfinder-Adventure-Troubles-in-Otari">Troubles in Otari</a> and added the character options from the <a href="https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventures/adventurePath/threefoldconspiracy">The Threefold Conspiracy</a> to the Starfinder Society Additional Resource document. By the end of this month, we hope to have <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq023hg/discuss&amp;page=last?Pathfinder-Adventure-The-Slithering">The Slithering</a> and another update to Starfinder Society Additional Resouces. We also are on target to have <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq026k5?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Ancestry-Guide">Lost Omens: Ancestry Guide</a> ready on release day (February 24th). We haven’t forgotten the Pathfinder (first edition) outstanding items, but we haven’t had the capacity to dip back into that system yet.</p> 
               <h2>GM Achievements</h2> 
               <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the 5th milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios, as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains (program dependant). A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th milestone is 650 hours!</p> 
               <p>We had one GM earn their 5th star this month. No GMs earned their fifth Nova or Glyph.</p> 
               <p><b>5th Star</b>: Dawn Upson</p> 
               <p>Congratulations on your achievement, Dawn!</p> 
               <h2>Conventions</h2> 
               <p>Convention season is just around the corner, and we’re starting to kick up planning for our major conventions. We hope to have information on how to volunteer soon! In the meantime, there are plenty of local events offering Paizo Organized Play. If you don’t see a convention on the list that you think should be there, contact the event organizer and ask them to register their event for organized play support.</p>

              <blockquote> 
               <p itemprop="description"><em>Flowers. Puh.</em></p> 
               <p>Teph grumbled as he trudged over the uneven ground. The tended dirt path was long gone by now, and his boots felt every bump of root and pinch of pebble. In the distance, well past the canopy and out of sight, thunder growled. The boy pulled his jacket tighter, hoping the storm would miss them tonight; he still had one more task before he could return home.</p> 
               <p>Gathering splitheart flowers. </p> 
               <p>The spiky, red flowers were a favorite of Mom’s, and they had just started to burst, revealing their perfect, crimson seeds. <em>The seeds fight off mosquitos. The leaves you boil for fevers.</em></p> 
               <p>Also, Teph noted, Mom liked to turn the petals into a paste to deepen the shade of her lips. He’d even tried it once himself, but found it altogether unpleasant; it smelled funny and he didn’t like how dark it made his mouth. He liked his lips just fine the way they were, thank you. Why did girls even <em>like</em> lip-color?</p> 
               <p>He arrived at the patch of splitheart and drew out his gathering pouch. Selecting only the ripest of the prickly flowers, he gathered each with a pinch of his fingers and a quiet word of thanks to the earth.</p> 
               <p>He arrived at the patch of splitheart and drew out his gathering pouch. Selecting only the ripest of the prickly flowers, he gathered each with a pinch of his fingers and a quiet word of thanks to the earth.</p> 
               <p>Flower picking. Teph rolled his eyes. This was not what heroes did.</p> 
               <p>The thought lingered as Teph wound his way back home. Real heroes got to solve mysteries, fight evil creatures, and save the day. Some day, he’d be a hero, like the ones in his favorite book, <em>The Grand Adventures of the Golden Wayfarers</em>. He’d be fast like Celadir Wind-Blown, dancing from rooftop to rooftop, his arrows always finding their mark. He’d be strong like Ukhul the Just, defending the helpless with a swing of his mighty sword. And he’d be wise and magical, like Zuridani Sunborn, summoning the elements themselves to help him win the day.</p> 
               <p>Teph painted his fingernails silver so they glittered when he moved his hands—just like Zuridani’s hands sparkled when he cast his spells. He even knew what his familiar would be: a fae dragon with one of its insectile wings blue and the other green—just like its eyes would be. Just like Teph’s were.</p> 
               <p>With his heroic heart and brave soul, he’d solve the world’s mysteries and save the day, and everyone would finally welcome him in the city instead of stare, distrusting. He wouldn’t have to keep a low profile or avoid the city at all; instead, they’d build him a tower of his own right in the middle of town, and his dad would never have to leave home again!</p> 
               <p>He’d make them welcome his mom, too, and make everyone apologize to them—for everything. For the ugly names they called him. For the horrible accusations they leveled at her.</p> 
               <p>The air grew colder, as did the boy’s mood; Teph knew in his stomach that the storm would arrive before dawn. Best not to dawdle. He skipped his usual extra stop at the eldest annon tree, and instead retraced his steps to the dirt path that led home. </p> 
               <p>The cottage just within the woods’ edge had been carefully built between the trees, with wild grasses and long stalks of cultivated herbs bending lazily in the chilling wind. The area was thick with the smell of herbs, intermingled with the sharp, stinging scent of the coming rains. It was usually a comfort. Usually a feeling of safety.</p> 
               <p>Right now, though, it was...<em>off</em>.</p> 
               <p>The heavy front door was halfway open, and no light could be seen from within. The decorative wreath and spiraling horn they kept on the door had been knocked off and lay, unloved, in the dirt. The comfort of being home disappeared, sinking heavily into his stomach with the weight of fear. What happened? Where was Mom? Did she need help?</p> 
               <p>The butterflies in his stomach warred with the excitement pounding in his chest. This was his moment. The first of many. He could be a hero, if he could just push back his fear.</p> 
               <p>Steeling himself, Teph crouched low, like Celadir might. Moving slowly, carefully, he approached the cracked door, senses alert for anything <em>off.</em></p> 
               <p>One step. Another. And then he was at his door.</p> 
               <p>What would Celadir do? Right. Check for traps. Trip-wires. Sounds of monsters past the doors.</p> 
               <p>…There was nothing.</p> 
               <p>Silence lay in wait just beyond, a stillness that made him hold his breath to quiet his own heartbeat. Fear was okay. Even Dad had said so. Fear was okay as long as it didn’t stop you completely.</p> 
               <p>He reached for the spiraling horn, the only potential weapon nearby, and his fingertips winked silver at him. His “magic,” there with him. It seemed to settle his heart and bring additional resolve; he knew this place inside and out. He would be okay. He would find whatever had broken into his home and bring it to justice.</p> 
               <p><em>One day I will save everyone. Let it start with this.</em></p> 
               <p>His fingers tightened around the curled horn, and with a mighty roar to make Ukhul the Just proud, Teph knocked the door completely open and charged inside, ready to fight.</p> 
               <p>The burst of sound startled the large figure shadowed in the corner, and it jumped to attention. Drawing itself to its full, massive height and towering over the boy, the shadows rolled off of a bent, pockmarked hide. The wrinkled, gnarled face loomed large, glowing, green eyes placed low on the face and emphasizing a hunched back and strong muscles. Magic gathered at two gnarled, meaty fists, and mighty Teph…screamed a high-pitch scream.</p> 
               <p>So did the figure.</p> 
               <p>The book the figure held flared as an illumination spell revealed the craggy, lined face of the green hag made plain. Teph barked out a surprised yelp and launched himself at it, dropping the curved horn and winding his arms tight around her. </p> 
               <p>The hag’s arms matched the boy’s, wrapping him up tightly. With the shock melting from her face, she squeezed him. “Sprout! You scared me.”</p> 
               <p>“Mom,” gasped Teph. “I saw the door and it wasn’t closed right and the wreath and knocker were on the ground and—”</p> 
               <p>Mom chuckled softly at the stream of words flowing from Teph’s mouth. “There, there, Sprout. All is well; I was just resting a bit. Catch probably just knocked the wreath loose trying to get in.” She looked around, her vivid, emerald eyes landing on her familiar. The spindly monkey drew the edge of the tablecloth around himself and chittered guiltily.</p> 
               <p>“See, there you go,” Mom said. “Did you bring the splitheart? Your father’s sure to be home soon.”</p> 
               <p>Teph nodded, handing over his collecting pouch and immediately starting for the bookshelf. He was safe, Mom was safe, and <em>The Grand Adventures of the Golden Wayfarers</em> called to him. </p> 
               <p>“Ah-ah,” Mom croaked, re-lighting the room’s mirrored lantern and letting her illumination spell fade. “Bath first. Story time later.”</p> 
               <p>“Mooooom,” whined Teph, giving up the path to the bookshelf even as he complained.</p> 
               <p>Several scrubbings later, after a change into fresh clothes, Father was home and the family basked in the glow of an over-full dinner table and a warm fire in the hearth.</p> 
               <p>Mom always made fantastic dinners, but they especially shone when Dad came home. The flatbreads were rolled tight and sliced extra-thin. She’d roasted peppers and tomatoes, skewering them between perfect, tender squares of meat. Roast honey-squash sweetened the air and lent a mouth-watering contrast to the sharp spice of the peppered rice. And for dessert? Hot cassava cakes with cold custard. </p> 
               <p>It almost made it worth the <em>icky stuff.</em></p> 
               <p>Teph knew he should be happy; not everyone had parents who loved each other so much. Not everyone even had parents. And especially someone like him, a callow may with a human father and a hag mother; the relationship that birthed the changeling was something special. Something genuine.</p>

               <p>That didn’t stop him from being grossed out every time Dad came home, all lovey-dovey kissy-sissy. Tonight, it had been flowers and a poem. </p> 
               <p>“From seven bright meadows I gathered you flowers,<br> From seven great trees I gathered the dew,<br> And long have I been gone, just counting the hours<br> And following my heart’s Call here, home to you.”</p> 
               <p><em>Eww.</em></p> 
               <p>After clearing the food from the table, Teph grabbed <em>The Grand Adventures of the Golden Wayfarers</em> and high-tailed it into the garden. The rain hadn’t started yet; he could still get a few stories in before they called him for bedtime. He lit his lantern and settled onto the cracked stone bench near the weeper tree. </p> 
               <p>Partway through the second story, the trees <em>groaned</em> suddenly, snapping the boy’s attention as something at the edge of the garden erupted from the ground. Twisting, sharp, and half-hidden by the shadows, the thing creaked and crackled, sinews twisting in the dim light of the boy’s lantern.</p> 
               <p>And then it was silent again. Still. And not for the first time today, Teph’s heart raced as he faced down a potential danger. Hiding in the weeper tree’s folds, he carefully aimed his lantern in the direction of the <em>thing</em>, and paused as he tried to understand the sight.</p> 
               <p>It was…a tree, but not. Spiraling grains of branches twisted about themselves over and over, like a strange series of veins making one large, tall structure. The wood looked old and petrified, as though it hadn’t just been born from nothing.</p> 
               <p>Was it….a tooth? It couldn’t be; it was definitely wood. He knew that much at first glance. A giant, petrified wooden tooth, swirling and vein-like.</p> 
               <p><em>No</em>, something in his mind insisted. Not just a tooth. Something far better! A <em>mystery</em>!</p> 
               <p><em>Real heroes solve mysteries, fight evil, and save the day. Let it start with this. </em></p> 
               <p>Eyes wide, heart pounding excitedly, Teph stepped toward the tree.</p>

               <p>In Starfinder AP #1, the first iconic encounter takes place at a loading dock on Absalom Station, so it’s only fitting that our first premium set of Starfinder Battles miniatures is also a docking bay. This piece features a two-person cargo transport vehicle with detachable trailer, a bench for waiting passengers or resting crew, and a variety of cargo containers in several size, shape, and color configurations. These are perfect for providing cover for any battles that might break out while your party is loading or unloading their starship, and work well as accents with any number of Starfinder Flip Mats and Flip-Tiles.</p>

               <p>No docking bay would be complete without aliens and starfarers to inhabit it. In two of the above scenes you can see the Pahtra Stalker (Medium Uncommon) and Cybernetic Golem (Large Uncommon), either of which you could find in a docking bay. Heck, since there are player character rules for the pahtra, you could even be one of them meeting the other one! The possibilities are endless.</p>
