  \  </div>\n     <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Paizo’s made a name\
  \ for itself on its adventures—even before the rise of the Pathfinder RPG, we were\
  \ creating standalone adventures and Adventure Paths. There’s an old industry adage\
  \ that “adventures don’t sell,” and while it’s true that a product like an adventure,\
  \ which is aimed only at the GM, will sell less than a product aimed at players,\
  \ I’ve never agreed with the theory that creating and publishing adventures is a\
  \ waste of resources. To me, adventures are the whole point of an RPG—without adventures,\
  \ GMs have nothing to run and players have nothing to play.</p>\n      <p>While\
  \ a custom-created adventure by your own GM will always be able to speak to your\
  \ table’s gaming preferences, creating adventures takes a lot of work. With published\
  \ adventures, a GM can not only save a lot of time in preparing for a game or a\
  \ campaign, but also find inspiration in them or learn how adventures are written,\
  \ both of which help a GM get better at their craft. And when you don’t have a group\
  \ to game with, even the simple act of reading a published adventure can help you\
  \ feel that you’re still connected to your hobby until you find a new group to game\
  \ with.</p>\n      <p>Published adventures have another advantage as well—they create\
  \ shared experiences for gamers to talk about. It’s one thing to be at a convention\
  \ or go online to talk about an adventure your PCs went on and how you barely made\
  \ it out of the dungeon alive, but when you’ve done this with a published adventure,\
  \ other gamers out there in the world who have been on the same adventure feel a\
  \ connection to your game, and a greater discourse can be born out of that experience\
  \ much in the same way as talking with friends about a recent movie or video game\
  \ everyone’s been watching or playing.</p>\n      <p>As big a part of Paizo’s history\
  \ as adventures are, it’s no surprise that we have several categories of adventures\
  \ to choose from—and with the recent adjustments to our Adventure Path lengths and\
  \ the formats of our standalone Adventures, I figured it’s time to chat a little\
  \ bit about how Paizo’s three categories of published adventures are different,\
  \ so you can figure out which category works best for your current campaign. Adventures\
  \ are broken down into three size categories: Small, Medium, and Large.</p>\n  \
  \    <h2>Small: Scenarios and Quests</h2>\n      <p>Our shortest adventure offerings\
  \ are Scenarios and Quests. These PDF-only products give you a shorter game experience\
  \ meant to play out over the course of two hours or so (in the case of a quest)\
  \ or a single game session (a scenario). These are all part of Paizo’s Organized\
  \ Play program, but they work just as well for a home game that needs a quick encounter\
  \ or a short filler adventure in between longer storylines. You can think of a Scenario\
  \ or a Quest as a short film.</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a\

  \      </div>\n      <br>\n      <h2>Medium: Standalone Adventures</h2>\n      <p>Our\
  \ standalone Adventures have recently undergone an upgrade—from this point onward,\
  \ starting with the upcoming adventure <em>Prey for Death</em>, our standalone adventures\
  \ will be hardcover 128-page books. A standalone Adventure will typically present\
  \ a single storyline that covers several sessions of gaming—as a general rule, you\
  \ can expect your characters to gain somewhere between 3 to 6 levels over the course\
  \ of a single standalone Adventure. This format allows us to explore larger storylines\
  \ that need more room than a single volume of an Adventure Path to play out, but\
  \ that don’t require the commitment to a three-part campaign—and also allow us to\
  \ get a bit more experimental (such as with <em>Prey for Death</em>, which expects\
  \ the players to all be Red Mantis Assassins—or at least closely allied with them!).\
  \ We’ve got some more fun experiments in the works going forward for this line,\
  \ so stay tuned! You can think of a standalone Adventure as a feature-length movie.</p>\n\

  \      <br>\n      <h2>Large: Adventure Paths</h2>\n      <p>Our Adventure Paths\
  \ have been going strong for over 200 volumes, and while we’ve made some adjustments\
  \ to their length (shifting from six-part campaigns down to three-part ones), this\
  \ line of adventures isn’t going anywhere. An Adventure Path is published in three\
  \ volumes that come out monthly; it can cover months or even years of gaming. You\
  \ can expect your PCs to gain about 10 levels over the course of an entire Adventure\
  \ Path. This format lets us tell long, sprawling stories that cover a wide range\
  \ of themes, to explore ongoing events in the world of Golarion, and to present\
  \ new parts of the world in great detail. You can think of an Adventure Path as\
  \ a season of episodes for a television series.</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
