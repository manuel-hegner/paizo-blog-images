  \    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Hello everyone! It's your friendly\
  \ cyber-neighborhood Venture Captain Tyler again, bringing you a quick discussion\
  \ about the options that we have as players in the Pathfinder Adventure Card Society.\
  \ (Note the new branding!). First I'll talk about the stunning number of characters\
  \ you can choose from, and then I'll talk about the mindboggling amount of content\
  \ there is to play through.</p> \n     <p> We have a LOT of character options now.\
  \ So many that I found it a daunting task when I started typing all of them out.\
  \ So, instead, I decided to do something a bit more fun… I made a graph! (Yes, I'm\
  \ a huge nerd, we all are, deal with it!)</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n      <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190701-unlocksfull.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190628-unlocks_500.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n      <p>Click on the image for a larger, more readable version!</p>\n \
  \    </div> \n     <p>There are a total of 32 class decks and 162 characters you\
  \ can play in PACS! (I'm counting Aric and the Red Raven as one playable character\
  \ even though they have 2 character cards.) In the graph, I've listed the characters\
  \ in the format \"Name (Deck or Box)\" in order to distinguish where they came from.\
  \ I've also listed some specific scenarios, adventures, or other means of unlocking\
  \ certain decks for certain characters. Altogether, the decks, characters, and means\
  \ of unlocks make up the nodes of the graph. </p> \n     <p> The edges of the graph\
  \ represent the way in which a character is available for any given deck. Most of\
  \ these are yellow arrows with the word \"Free\" on the label. This means that you\
  \ can use this character with the associated deck without any additional requirement.\
  \ Obviously, you can use, the monk Rooboo with the the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy9hvy\"\
  ><em>Monk Class Deck</em></a> she came in. But the PACS Guide also says you can\
  \ swap any character with any other character of the same class. For example, the\
  \ Pathfinder Tales deck includes the wizard Varian, so you can replace him with\
  \ any of the other 9 PACG wizards: Varian from Curse of the Crimson Throne; Darago,\
  \ Ezren, Melindra, or Radillo from the Wizard Class Deck; Nyctessa from Hell's Vengeance\
  \ 2; or Ezren from RotR, Mummy's Mask, or the Core Set. (The Tales deck also gives\
  \ you free access to 9 rogues and 8 sorcerers—that's 27 \"Free\" characters to choose\
  \ from!) </p> \n     <p> The new <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01yju?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-We-Be-Heroes\"\
  ><em>We Be Heroes?</em> Free RPG Day adventure</a> includes 4 new goblin characters:\
  \ Crimsi the ranger, Grenek the barbarian, Pizazz the bard, and Siathorn the druid.\
  \ The rule I described above means they can be played with the Class Deck corresponding\
  \ to their respective classes, but thanks to a table on page 8 of the most recent\
  \ PACS Guide, they can also be played with the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy9jcw\"\
  ><em>Goblins Fight! Character Deck</em></a> (Crimsi and Grenek) or <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy9k5m\"\
  ><em>Goblins Burn! Character Deck</em></a> (Pizazz and Siathorn). Looking at the\
  \ graph, you'll notice another connection for Crimsi: the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy9sxh\"\
  ><em>Hunter Class Deck</em></a>. This is thanks to a beautifully written adventure\
  \ reward from Season of Factions' Favor Adventure 4: \"Each player unlocks the ability\
  \ to play all characters that have the Ranger trait using the Hunter Class Deck.\"\
  \ This is one of several character unlocks that are achieved through completing\
  \ specific sets of scenarios, with the best example of these being my buddy Mavaro\
  \ from Mummy's Mask, who can be played with a total of FIVE different decks, four\
  \ of them through adventure completion unlocks. These unlocks are represented on\
  \ the graph by maroon or orange nodes with names in the format \"S4A4\" for Season\
  \ 4 Adventure 4, or \"S5-5E\" for Season 5 Scenario 5E. </p> \n     <p> There are\
  \ four new characters in the <em>Curse of the Crimson Throne</em> adventure path,\
  \ three of whom don't have a matching Class Deck. But fear not! Page 9 of the PACS\
  \ Guide gives us decks for these characters, with Kess the Brawler using the <a\
  \ href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy9e8d\"><em>Barbarian Class Deck</em></a>,\
  \ Quinn the Investigator using the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy9x03\"\
  ><em>Ultimate Equipment Add-on Deck</em></a>, and Hakon the Skald using the <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/products/btpy9pl6\"><em>Warpriest Class Deck</em></a>. (Crimson\
  \ Throne's other character, Varian the Wizard, starts off with <em>three</em> deck\
  \ options—Wizard, Tales, and Hell's Vengeance 2—so he's versatile from day one.)\
  \ And don't forget that you can add an Ultimate Add-On Deck to a Class Deck or Character\
  \ Deck, or add a Class Deck or Character Deck to an Ultimate Add-On Deck (as described\
  \ on page 8 of the PACS Guide), giving you loads of choices for your card upgrades!\
  \ </p> \n     <p> There's one more character on the graph that I'd like to specifically\
  \ point out: Arueshalae from the Wrath of the Righteous base set. Arueshalae—or\
  \ Aruey, as I like to call her <em>(please don't tell her that)</em>—was unlocked\
  \ way back in season 1 for a few lucky convention-goers who were able to pick up\
  \ a specific convention boon. It allowed them to use her with the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy97id\"\
  ><em>Rogue Class Deck</em></a>—but only in Season of the Righteous. Now, however,\
  \ there is a new way to unlock our succubus friend, and play her in any scenario!\
  \ </p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190628-aruey.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190628-aruey_500.jpeg\"></a>\
  \ \n      <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\">My friend Aruey, always willing to help\
  \ out her friends... and smite some serious demon butt.</p>\n     </div> \n    \
  \ <p>The <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy9g8v?Pathfinder-Society-Adventure-Card-Guild-Adventure-13-Lexicon-of-Paradox\"\
  ><em>Season of the Righteous Adventure</em> 3 PDF</a> was updated recently: the\
  \ reward for that adventure now unlocks Arueshalae with the Hell's Vengeance 2 deck.\
  \ This reward is retroactive, so if you have completed all 4 scenarios of <em>Season\
  \ of the Righteous Adventure 3: Lexicon of Paradox</em>, you have already earned\
  \ the following reward: </p> \n     <p><span style=\"border-top: 1px solid #fff;\

  \ margin: 0 auto; background: rgba(128,128,128, 0.3); width: 75%; display: block;\
  \ position: relative;\"> Each player unlocks the ability to play Arueshalae from\
  \ the<em> Wrath of the Righteous Demon's Heresy Adventure Deck</em> using the <em>Hell's\
  \ Vengeance 2 Character Deck</em>. When Arueshalae is Tier 3 or higher, you may\
  \ add the loot cards Spherewalker Staff, Starbow, and Swallowtail Bracers to your\
  \ Class Deck box.</span> <br style=\"clear: all;\"> </p> \n     <p> A huge number\
  \ of players just gained a new character to play... and she's quite the character,\
  \ with a cohort and several Owner boons coming along with her. I recommend adding\
  \ the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy9vmz\"><em>Ultimate Combat Add-On\
  \ Deck</em></a> when playing with her, for maximum arrow-based destruction! </p>\
  \ \n     <p> I know a lot of our players out there are concerned with compatibility\
  \ of the old class decks with the new <em>Core</em> and <em>Curse</em> cards. The\
  \ folks at Lone Shark and Paizo have heard you, and they've been hard at work on\
  \ some creative solutions. Make sure you check out the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/pathfinder/cardgame/conversion\"\
  >Conversion Guide</a>, especially the Characters and Roles section. </p> \n    \
  \ <p> Also, <a href=\"https://paizo.com/threads/rzs42kvo?Guide-60-released#2\">Vic\
  \ recently made a post</a> that gives us an option for trying out some new cards\
  \ in our class decks, letting you swap any class deck card for any Core or Curse\
  \ card that has the same name! You'll need to own copies of these cards, and you'll\
  \ need to come up with innovative ways to make sure your cards don't end up mixed\
  \ up with those of the box that you're using to play (I recommend a small sliver\
  \ of colored Post-It Note stuck to your cards). Or, you can play online with us\
  \ over in the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/campaigns/PFSACGFlaxseedOnDeckAdventureCardGuildLodge/recruiting&amp;page=last\"\
  >Flaxseed On Deck play-by-post lodge</a>, where your cards will never get mixed\
  \ up because they're digital! </p> \n     <p> </p>\n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ content that has been released in regular Adventure Path form! The last of these,\
  \ released just this month, is a four-scenario adventure written by David Jacobson\
  \ and myself, outlined and developed by Linda Zayas-Palmer, with rules text from\
  \ Keith Richmond. Working on this was a blast, particularly since it let us draw\
  \ inspiration from David's and my fan-made Adventure Card Game adventures that we've\
  \ run at PaizoCon the past several years, including our own take on <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo5lk9g\"\
  ><em>Season of the Kobolds</em></a>. </p> \n     <br clear=\"all\"> \n     <p> Up\
  \ next is Year 6: Year of Rotting Ruin (Uses Core and Curse; 6 adventures, Tiers\
  \ 1–6)—the first adventure drops at Gen Con on August 1! </p> \n     <p> And it\
  \ doesn't even stop there! <em>The Dragon's Demand</em>, <em>Curse of the Crimson\
  \ Throne</em>, and <em>We Be Heroes?</em> have also been sanctioned for PACS play.\
  \ Each product page below includes a link to a sanctioning document that details\
  \ the changes that need to be made for PACS play: </p> \n     <p> </p>\n     <ul>\
  \ \n      <li><a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01ws7?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Core-Set\"\
  ><em>Core Set: The Dragon's Demand</em></a> (Core and optionally any AP; 3 adventures;\
  \ Tiers 1–3–but with unlimited replay at Tiers 1–6 for the random scenario, effectively\
  \ giving you an <em>endless supply</em> of fresh PACS scenarios!) </li> \n     \
  \ <li> <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01ws8?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Curse-of-the-Crimson-Throne-Adventure-Path\"\
  ><em>Curse of the Crimson Throne</em></a> (6 adventures with 1 bonus scenario; Tiers\
  \ 1-6) </li> \n      <li> <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01yju?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-We-Be-Heroes\"\
  ><em>We Be Heroes?</em></a> (1 adventure, Tier 1) </li> \n     </ul> \n     <p></p>\
  \ \n     <p> In addition, Linda announced at PaizoCon that we will soon be seeing\
  \ some standalone PACS adventures that can be played at several different tiers,\
  \ so stay tuned for more news on that front. There are so many new options for play,\
  \ my head is spinning! </p> \n     <p> That's it for me today. I'm sure you can\
  \ tell that I'm excited about all of the new content and character options that\
  \ we have available to us now and moving forward, and I'm sure the comments section\
  \ of this blog will quickly include a rousing debate over the best ways to play\
  \ some of the characters shown in the graph. (I'll likely start off the comments\
  \ by expanding my <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkm1?Making-the-Most-of-Character-Unlocks\"\
  >previous list of best secondary decks</a> to add to any given character.) Thanks\
  \ for reading, and I look forward to playing with as many of you as I can! </p>\
