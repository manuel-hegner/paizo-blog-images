  \   </div> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">The bonds of\
  \ family are strong and can blind even the gods to atrocity and awfulness. And no\
  \ deity knows better the dangers of trusting one’s sibling than Shelyn, sister of\
  \ Zon-Kuthon.</p> \n      <p>In the earliest days of mortal life on Golarion, there\
  \ was no Zon-Kuthon. None suspected what dark fate awaited Shelyn’s brother Dou-Bral,\
  \ and indeed the two deities were, in many societies, worshiped as a single faith,\
  \ an inseparable pair devoted to the pursuit of song and joy. But even among the\
  \ ranks of the divine, nothing is forever. The most dour and depressed take a lesson\
  \ in this, alas, in that a mortal’s limited time on the world is a blessing. For\
  \ the longer one lives, the more chances you’ll have of facing betrayal from those\
  \ you once held most dear.</p> \n      <p>Arguments between siblings are part of\
  \ the parcel, and both Shelyn and Dou-Bral had had their share of squabbles before,\
  \ but the clash that would shatter their familial ties was something so overwhelming\
  \ that it changed both deities forever. Whatever the cause of the great dissonance\
  \ between the siblings, the results were undeniable. Dou-Bral abandoned his faithful\
  \ and reality alike, leaving his sister to grieve and mourn as if he had perished.\
  \ The prayers of Dou-Bral’s faithful went unheard, and those of the faith who survived\
  \ this betrayal were welcomed into Shelyn’s church even as the goddess herself struggled\
  \ with the results of that great sadness. It would be ages before anyone heard again\
  \ of Shelyn’s brother, but when they did, they—Shelyn included—would have rather\
  \ remained forever in mourning.</p> \n      <p>For when he returned, he was no longer\
  \ Dou-Bral. He had become Zon-Kuthon. Unknown to the gods or the faithful, Dou-Bral\
  \ had not only abandoned his family and followers, but reality itself. He had traveled\
  \ to the very depths of the Outer Rifts, pushing beyond borders held in fear by\
  \ the most ancient dwellers in those unknown Abyssal depths, to emerge into the\
  \ Beyond Beyond. And what he found there destroyed him. And what he found there\
  \ reincarnated him. A cycle of death and rebirth taken place outside of the auspices\
  \ of Pharasma herself, Dou-Bral ended and Zon-Kuthon began.</p> \n      <p>Forever\
  \ changed and transformed from the unimaginable ordeals and torments suffered during\
  \ his absence, Zon-Kuthon did not immediately seek his family’s pardon upon his\
  \ return, yet as different as he had become from what had been before, enough of\
  \ Dou-Bral remained within the tormented frame of the new god of loss and pain for\
  \ Shelyn to take notice.</p> \n      <p>Zon-Kuthon repaid Shelyn’s extended hand\
  \ of forgiveness with trauma and agony, piercing the flesh of her hand with his\
  \ razored nails. When she cried out in pain and again offered forgiveness, Zon-Kuthon\
  \ responded by slaughtering their father, Thron. The mutilated god twisted and broke\
  \ and reshaped Thron into his own enslaved herald, the Prince in Chains, an act\
  \ that provoked Shelyn into something she had never before engaged in—battle.</p>\

  \      </div> \n      <p>The siblings’ combat shook the pillars of reality, and\
  \ on worlds spread throughout the Material Plane, things of beauty withered and\
  \ wept and bled and died. Zon-Kuthon had grown powerful indeed from his exposure\
  \ to that which transformed him Beyond the Beyond, but Shelyn was empowered by her\
  \ own righteousness. The battle ended in a draw as Shelyn wrested away Zon-Kuthon’\
  s murderous glaive. She’d hoped that separating him from what she believed to be\
  \ the source of his corruption would set him free, but in the time of horrors that\
  \ followed, she realized that the glavie itself was not the source—that her brother\
  \ was now forever a slave to loss. As news of Zon-Kuthon’s treatment of his father\
  \ and sister spread among the gods, an unsettling schism began to form. Some took\
  \ offense at the acts and called for Zon-Kuthon’s execution. Others expressed admiration\
  \ for his cruelty and professed support in pursuit of a change to divine order.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Abadar, forever protector of society, be it among mortals or the divine,\
  \ saw the rumblings of civil war among the gods and took action. He offered Zon-Kuthon\
  \ a choice to accept banishment to the prison realm of Xovaikain on the Plane of\
  \ Shadow for as long as the sun hung in the skies above Golarion, and in return\
  \ offered the Midnight Lord a single item from the First Vault. Zon-Kuthon agreed\
  \ and chose from the vault the First Shadow, and once again left the ranks of the\
  \ divine.</p> \n      <p>There are those who say Zon-Kuthon knew of the promise\
  \ of Earthfall, and even others who dared imply he had a hand in its engineering.\
  \ Whatever the case, the Age of Darkness blotted out the sun above Golarion, and\
  \ Zon-Kuthon was released from what should have been eternal imprisonment. In that\
  \ time, though, tempers had cooled. Zon-Kuthon took his gift of the First Shadow\
  \ and used it to transform his one-time prison into his planar realm and cemented\
  \ his divine rule over the nation of Nidal, but he was careful to moderate his atrocities\
  \ so as to avoid arousing the wrath of the other gods. And while his evil lingers\
  \ in the literal shadow of greater dangers, much as the nation of Nidal’s cruelties\
  \ are overshadowed by the more blatant mayhem and tyranny of neighboring Cheliax,\
  \ Shelyn has not forgotten. Still she seeks a method of redeeming her lost brother.\
  \ Still she seeks a way to save him from the horrors Beyond Beyond. And those who\
  \ know and love the goddess of love can only pray themselves she finds a way, lest\
  \ what transformed her brother so long ago find new despair to ripen within.</p>\

  \ \n      <p>James Jacobs is the Creative Director for Pathfinder. While he was\
  \ there at the beginning of Golarion’s creation, many of the deities worshiped by\
  \ that world’s heroes and villains had already existed for decades before. Goddesses\
  \ and gods like Desna and Rovagug, Sarenrae and Abadar, Achaekek and Zon-Kuthon\
  \ first established their faithful among PCs and NPCs alike in James’ home campaign\
  \ in the late 80s and early 90s. Sharing them with the world as deities of the Pathfinder\
  \ setting, seeing players and creators come to love and hate them (and in some cases\
  \ cosplay as them), has been a career highlight.</p> \n      <p style=\"font-weight:\
  \ bold; line-height: 14px\">About the Windsong Testaments</p> \n      <p>On the\
  \ northern reaches of Varisia’s Lost Coast stands Windsong Abbey, a forum for interfaith\
  \ discussion tended by priests of nearly twenty faiths and led by a legacy of Masked\
  \ Abbesses. At the dawn of the Age of Lost Omens, Windsong Abbey suffered as its\
  \ faithful fought and fled, but today it has begun to recover. A new Masked Abbess\
  \ guides a new flock within, and the <i>Windsong Testaments</i>—parables about the\
  \ gods themselves—are once again being recorded within the abbey’s walls. Some of\
  \ these Testaments are presented here as Golarion’s myths and fables. Some parts\
  \ may be true. Other parts are certainly false. Which ones are which is left to\
  \ the faithful to decide.</p> \n     </blockquote> \n    </div> <!-- tags:  The\
