  artist: "the end of the first adventure, it should be. It's a small spoiler to players\
    \ who see the cover, but that's less important than having an eye-catching cover\
    \ in the first place, really. But there's a world of difference between showing\
    \ off an illustration of a character and posting an extensive back story for that\
    \ character. For the iconic heroes, this was never a problem since they don't\
    \ actually appear in the adventures. Going forward, though, it's probably not\
    \ a good idea to spell out exactly what an NPC's role in the adventure is. One\
    \ thing to keep in mind, though, is that just because an NPC shows up on a cover\
    \ doesn't mean that NPC is a bad guy. We'll be putting potential allies of the\
    \ PCs up on the cover now and then as well. Pictured here, for example, is an\
    \ elven general named Allevrah. She's a pretty important member of Kyonin's military\
    \ forces, and has certainly seen her share of battle (note her clipped ear—the\
    \ result of a close call in a battle against a babau assassin—wound whose scar\
    \ she wears with pride as a trophy). Her role in Second Darkness is pretty important—\
    important enough that we chose to illustrate her on the Gen Con alternate cover\
    \ to Pathfinder #13, but if you want to know what that role is, I'm afraid you'll\
    \ have to play the adventure! James Jacobs Pathfinder Editor-in-Chief"
