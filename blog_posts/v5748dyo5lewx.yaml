  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">After\
  \ two weeks of focusing on the <a href=\"/products/btpy8zd9\">Undead Horde</a>,\
  \ it's time to get back into the water for more previews from August's upcoming\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy8xg6\">Skull &amp; Shackles</a> set of 55 prepainted plastic\
  \ miniatures!</span></p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130607-Elder.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130607-Elder_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Up first this week is a terror from below the seas,\
  \ an undead creature known as an Elder Brykolakas. This shapechanging undead menace\
  \ appears in <a href=\"/products/btpy8tc6\">Pathfinder #59</a>, and if the player\
  \ characters aren't very careful, they may end up facing hordes of them. Accordingly,\
  \ we've assigned this figure to the common rarity.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130628-Barnabas_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Here we have the pirate lord Barnabus Harrigan, the\
  \ cover-model for <a href=\"/products/btpy8rcc\">Pathfinder #55</a> and the captain\
  \ of the good ship <i>Wormwood</i>. Your players will have plenty of reasons to\
  \ hate Captain Harrigan, so we thought it important to include a miniature for the\
  \ inevitable battle against him. The figure doubles nicely for any kind of pirate,\
  \ thug, barbarian, or even a player character. Barnabus Harrigan is slated at the\
  \ uncommon rarity.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130628-Tessa.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130628-Tessa_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Not all pirate lords of the Shackles are right bastards\
  \ like Barnabus Harrigan. A few of them might even turn out to be allies. Such is\
  \ the case with Tess Fairwind, Mistress of Quent and captain of the sloop-of-war\
  \ <i>Luck of the Draw</i>. Tessa turns out to be one of the most valuable allies\
  \ in the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/skullAndShackles\">Skull &amp; Shackles\
  \ Adventure Path</a>, making her a must-have figure. She also makes a great figure\
  \ for a swashbuckler PC. We've put her at the uncommon rarity.</p> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130628-CannonGolem.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130628-CannonGolem_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>BOOM! The impressive Cannon Golem leaps off the pages\
  \ of <a href=\"/products/btpy8odu\">Bestiary 3</a> and into your Skull &amp; Shackles\
  \ campaign with this amazing miniature. Clocking in at CR 15 and packing a hell\
  \ of a gunpowder punch, this menace is one your players will not soon forget! This\
  \ Large figure is slated at the Rare rarity.</p> \n    <p>That's it for this week.\
  \ Tune in next Friday for a very special “from the PaizoCon floor” post with new\
  \ reveals we hope you'll really enjoy! In the meantime, please consider setting\
  \ up an <a href=\"/products/btpy8o6b\">Ongoing Pathfinder Battles Case Subscription</a>\
  \ to make sure you don't miss a single figure!</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p>\
