  \ \n     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Nkayah yawned from her\
  \ post in the tall tree. The job of scouting and protecting wanderers was always\
  \ more exciting on the move. On the move, she had to stay on her toes, taking silent\
  \ cover behind trees or climbing into the jungle canopy to maintain line of sight\
  \ with the strangers and visitors who passed through Ekujae lands. She lived for\
  \ the silent chase as she assessed outsiders’ motivations. For over a century and\
  \ a half, Nkayah had ensured non-Mwangi travelers posed no threat to the Ekujae,\
  \ and that they didn’t release any of the myriad evils trapped within the heart\
  \ of the jungle—intentionally or not.</p> \n      <p>It was an important job that\
  \ Nkayah took with the seriousness it deserved, but it could also be incredibly\
  \ boring. Like right now, as she strained to keep from nodding off while watching\
  \ two foreigners talk about, well, something. It didn’t help that the dwarf and\
  \ half-orc interlopers spoke a language completely foreign to her. It sounded similar\
  \ to the Avistani language the Aspis Consortium agents from Bloodcove spoke when\
  \ they needed to hide their awful deeds, but she had no linguistic training to confirm\
  \ it. Despite not knowing what they were saying, the experience she’d earned over\
  \ decades of training made her confident that their intent wasn’t malicious. But\
  \ they were stumbling—loudly—through a very ancient Serpentfolk ruin, and that meant\
  \ that they still posed a threat.</p> \n      <p>She strained her jaw as she stifled\
  \ a yawn and adjusted her position to ensure she didn’t get too comfortable. A wilderness\
  \ nap could wait until the pair of foreigners moved beyond her territory and became\
  \ someone else’s responsibility. Whatever they sought, the longer they spent out\
  \ in the open like this, the longer they were in danger of needing more than just\
  \ surveillance. Sometimes it helped to remember that even these boring parts of\
  \ the job ultimately kept the innocent and defenseless wanderers of their lands\
  \ safe, as well as protecting her people and the world at large.</p> \n      <p>The\
  \ dwarf and her half-orc companion let out a series of surprised shouts, snapping\
  \ Nkayah’s attention back to the moment. Doubtless, she wasn’t the only one in the\
  \ area reminded of the visitors’ presence by their arguing. They seemed at odds\
  \ about what to make of one particular section of the ruin, a strange stone that\
  \ Nkayah had never noticed here before. Perhaps the situation wasn’t quite as boring\
  \ as she’d thought!</p> \n      <p>She scurried from branch to bough, until she\
  \ found herself balanced on a long, lonely limb directly over the foreigners. She\
  \ was close to them, no more than ten feet above the half-orc’s head, so they could\
  \ easily see her if they looked up, but they were too engrossed in the strange stone\
  \ formation. As long as she didn’t draw their gaze, they wouldn’t be looking up\
  \ any tiem soon. </p> \n      <p>The formation was a cone of rough stone, nearly\
  \ seven feet from base to point, that rose like an incisor from the ground. It wasn’\
  t worked stone like the rest of the Serpentfolk ruin, and it lacked the ophidian\
  \ motifs and iconography that denoted the ancient Ydersian structures for what they\
  \ were. This looked both organic and completely at odds with the natural order,\
  \ and it was no wonder it had so grasped the visitors’ attention. The dwarf held\
  \ her hand a few inches from the stalactite’s surface, but didn’t touch it, as though\
  \ sensing for an aura of evil.</p> \n      <p>No, she wasn’t feeling an aura, but\
  \ rather a steady stream of frigid air blowing from the stone’s otherwise smooth\
  \ surface. Now that she recognized it, Nkayah could feel the steady airflow herself,\
  \ and even at this distance. The chill made the skin on her arms prickle with gooseflesh.\
  \ This certainly warranted more investigation, but she had to focus on her charges—\
  the dwarf and the half-orc, not the ruin, which she’d be able to come back to once\
  \ the pair no longer presented a threat. And the louder they got, the greater that\
  \ threat grew.</p> \n      <p>Doubtless, her counterparts from nearby were already\
  \ on their way to see what the fuss was about. Nhayah shook her head and loosened\
  \ the harness holding her weapons to her body. This was going to get worse before\
  \ it got better.</p> \n      <p>Her instincts proved accurate when the sound of\
  \ arrows in flight drew her attention away from the outsiders and toward the edge\
  \ of the ruins. She wasn’t the only Ekujae in the area anymore.</p> \n      <p>The\
  \ dwarf and half-orc were still loudly arguing about the cold stone tooth. They\
  \ hadn’t noticed the arrival of Nkayah’s kin, and she knew they wouldn’t hear her\
  \ either as she skittered effortlessly away, mere feet above their heads. Without\
  \ losing sight of the foreign travelers, Nhayah darted in towards the site of the\
  \ arrows’ impact.</p> \n      <p>It didn’t take long to find one, embedded into\
  \ the trunk of a gnarled tree: a darkwood arrow with dull gray fletching, clearly\
  \ Ekujae-made. If she were on the ground, it would be at eye-level, meaning whatever\
  \ they were shooting at was not terribly large. As she dropped down and pulled the\
  \ arrow out to inspect it, her teeth clenched instinctively. Nkayah glanced at her\
  \ surroundings to locate the arrow’s source, but knew her compatriots were as good\
  \ at remaining unseen as she was. She’d see them when they wanted to be seen, just\
  \ as they likely didn’t know she was there until she revealed herself.</p> \n  \
  \    <p>The arrowhead was tipped with cold iron, finely sharpened, and faintly tingling\
  \ with magical energy that pulsed lightly into her fingertips. Though the spell\
  \ was no longer active, she knew what its presence meant.</p> \n      <p>“Demons”\
  \ she hissed, still too soft for her charges to hear, even if they weren’t now yards\
  \ away and engrossed in their investigation. She wished she could scream at them.\
  \ <em>Leave it alone, you fools. Leave our lands and stop meddling in things you\
  \ don’t understand!</em></p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"\

  \   </div> \n      <p>She pulled her bow from her back and swung back up into the\
  \ branches with her free arm. She moved swiftly back to her spot where she’d previously\
  \ kept watch and aimed her bow across the clearing in the direction she knew this\
  \ threat would come from. She hadn’t yet determined whether the demon was somehow\
  \ tied to the cold-air stone or simply drawn to the site by the outsiders, but regardless,\
  \ the pair didn’t deserve to die at the claws of a vicious demon just because they\
  \ were loud.</p> \n      <p>The underbrush rustled as the threat approached, and\
  \ she notched a cold iron arrow of her own. A hulking form, only partially visible\
  \ through the jungle’s dense foliage, emerged. She fired. The arrow flew true, and\
  \ the dark form hissed as its iron head burned across its demonic body. The dwarf\
  \ and her companion, suddenly aware that they weren’t alone in the ruins, stared,\
  \ paralyzed with fear, and barely mustered the strength to look up and see Nkayah\
  \ above them, fearless, with another arrow at the ready. She released the bowstring;\
  \ the arrow flew and then… darkness.</p> \n      <p>She cursed as she dropped from\
  \ the tree, racing for where her charges once stood, but could not find them in\
  \ the darkness. The cool, constant airflow from the stone tooth let her know where\
  \ it stood, where the dwarf and half-orc had been a moment before. She listened\
  \ for their voices, but they were either too scared to scream or already lost. Then,\
  \ her ears caught other voices, two of them, in her own tongue.</p> \n      <p>“\
  Hunters!” she called back in kind. “Speak again so that I may find you. I am a scout.\
  \ I can navigate to you in this darkness.”</p> \n      <p>The elves obeyed and signaled\
  \ to her in hushed tones, somewhere off to her left. She made her way to them, slowly,\
  \ not wanting to injure herself on a bit of the ruin she could not see. It took\
  \ some time but finally, she connected with another form. The other thankfully stood\
  \ firmly despite the collision.</p> \n      <p>“I am Nkayah of the Bat Clan. My\
  \ mother was of the Hawk Clan. You’re demon hunters?”</p> \n      <p> The erratic\
  \ sound of the others’ steps told her they were fumbling in the dark. “I am Kayoye,”\
  \ the voice to her right began, “of the Velociraptor Clan. My mother is of the Gecko\
  \ clan, and we hunt all forms of evil in this jungle. Today’s prey just happened\
  \ to be a demon.”</p> \n      <p>“And I am Dafiyi, also of the Velociraptor Clan.\
  \ My mother is of the Python clan. The darkness should wear off shortly. This is\
  \ not its first attempt to escape us today.”</p> \n      <p>Nkayah sighed. Waiting\
  \ without being able to see anything at all was incredibly frustrating, but she\
  \ stood alert, with a firm grasp on her bow and an arrow at the ready. Soon, the\
  \ demon’s magical cloak of darkness disappeared as swiftly as it had descended,\
  \ and the dim, green-tinted light of the sun through jungle canopy flooded her sight.\
  \ Finally able to see, the elves clustered together, back-to-back, and notched arrows,\
  \ centuries of experience between them allowing the trio to work seamlessly as a\
  \ defensive unit despite just meeting moments earlier. They rotated clockwise, six\
  \ sharp eyes and six keen ears scanning the jungle from leaf-strewn floor to branch-woven\
  \ canopy for any threat. The demon was gone, and no trace of the dwarf and the half-orc\
  \ remained.</p> \n      <p>Nkayah cursed and kicked a piece of rubble. She rolled\
  \ the events of the past few minutes over in her head: the serpentfolk ruins, the\
  \ new-yet-ancient otherworldly stalactite, the demon, and the demon hunters now\
  \ flanking her. </p> \n      <p>It was a coincidence. The cold-blowing stone and\
  \ the demon were unrelated. That made things more interesting, perhaps, but also\
  \ more complicated.</p> \n      <p>Dafiyi stared at the ground in concentration\
  \ and muttered an incantation to himself, then pointed to the east. “Kayoye and\
  \ I still have a demon to kill. We found it before, and we’ll find it again. And\
  \ you?”</p> \n      <p>Nkayah surveyed the trees around her, searching for an answer.\
  \ It came to her in the form of two familiar voices yelling in distress. The dwarf\
  \ and half-orc were still alive!</p> \n      <p>She nodded to her kin and smirked,\
  \ “Sounds like I still have two charges that need my protection, and what do you\
  \ know? They seem to be in the same direction! I’ll have to return to check on <em>that</em>\
  \ later.” She tilted her head toward the mysterious stone amid the ruins.</p> \n\
  \      <p>Swiftly and silently, she made her way through the dense jungle toward\
  \ the frantic voices to the east. Dafiyi and Kayoye fell into step just behind her.\
  \ This was more like it, she thought to herself. The job of protecting wanderers\
  \ was always more exciting on the move.</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p style=\"\
