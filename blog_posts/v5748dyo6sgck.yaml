  \    </div> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">As we draw ever closer to the end\
  \ of the playtest, there are still a number of questions we need to ask you about\
  \ the way the game works and how that's conveyed to you in the book. Today, we're\
  \ launching a pair of surveys that do just that, one focusing on presentation and\
  \ another focusing on magic.</p> \n    <h2>Presentation</h2> \n    <p>First up,\
  \ we have a survey looking at the presentation of the book. This survey looks at\
  \ our use of symbols, color, and language to convey game rules to you. We tried\
  \ some experimental things with the <a href=\"/products/btq01vb7?Pathfinder-Playtest-Rulebook\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Playtest Rulebook</em></a>, and want to know what you think of these\
  \ tests. Your answers will help us determine what the final version of the game\
  \ actually looks like. When you're ready to take this survey, follow the link below.</p>\
  \ \n    <p><a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/PFPPresentation\"><b>Presentation\
  \ Survey</b></a></p> \n    <h2>Spells and Magic</h2> \n    <p>Next up, we've opened\
  \ up a survey to look at how spells and magic items work in the game. This isn't\
  \ the first time we've asked about these topics, but previously, it's always been\
  \ in the context of other surveys with other goals. This time, we want to know specifically\
  \ what you think about how magic works in the Pathfinder Playtest.</p> \n    <p>One\
  \ of our primary goals in designing the playtest rules was to ensure that spells\
  \ and magic items are still an integral part of the game, but also to make sure\
  \ characters who don't rely heavily on such abilities aren't overshadowed. We did\
  \ this in a variety of ways, but there are some places where it seems clear that\
  \ the restrictions may have taken away a bit too much from magic and its role in\
  \ the game. This survey looks at ways that we might add some sizzle back into your\
  \ <i>lightning bolt</i> and some charm into your, well, <i>charm</i>.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>In particular, there are three levers we can manipulate to add power and versatility\
  \ to magic that we want you to think about when taking this survey:</p> \n    <ol>\
  \ \n     <li>Number of spells per day.</li> \n     <li>Chance that a spell will\
  \ succeed (or that foes will fail saving throws).</li> \n     <li>Power of individual\
  \ spells.</li> \n    </ol> \n    <p>Once you've given those some thought, you can\
  \ find the survey at the link below.</p> \n    <p><a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/PFPSpellsMagic\"\
  ><b>Magic Survey</b></a></p> \n    <h2>Looking Forward</h2> \n    <p>Finally, I\
  \ want to take a moment to talk about where we're at right now in the playtest and\
  \ where we're heading in the future. We've gotten a lot of data about the game,\
  \ and much of it has been synthesized into a very large list of tasks and things\
  \ that we need to do to the game before it goes to the printer next year. In the\
  \ coming months, the playtest will draw to a close, and there will be no additional\
  \ public updates to the rules while we focus on making changes to the game.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>That said, we're not going to leave you without an idea of where things\
  \ are going. Next week, we'll be dropping an absolutely huge Update 1.6, which adds\
  \ or adjusts aspects of every class in the game! This ranges from a small alteration\
  \ in stances that affects the fighter to major changes for the alchemist and paladin.\
  \ We think you'll see a lot of your concerns addressed in some of these changes,\
  \ and the best part is, these are just a fraction of what we're doing behind the\
  \ scenes to make the game even better!</p> \n    <p>As always, I want to thank each\
  \ and every one of you for participating in this playtest. The game is really shaping\
  \ up to be something great, and you helped make that happen!</p> \n    <p>Jason\
