  description\">Avast, me hearties! The Good Ship Pathfinder Battles has passed the\
  \ intriguing Isles of PaizoCon and soon we will be upon the great continent of Gen\
  \ Con. We've recently seen the release of the <a href=\"/products/btpy8ww8\">We\
  \ Be Goblins!</a> Builder Series, the <a href=\"/products/btpy8yj4\">White Dragon\
  \ Evolution</a> Encounter Pack, and the <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lex5\">Konkrud</a>\
  \ convention special promotional figure (which we'll also have at Gen Con). Just\
  \ this last weekend at the PaizoCon Preview Banquet we announced the next full set\
  \ of 55 figures, entitled <a href=\"/products/btpy909j\">Legends of Golarion</a>,\
  \ scheduled for release in October. Rumors abound of an additional set by the end\
  \ of the year, and the sea-salt smell of new announcements is in the briny air.</span></p>\
  \ \n     <p>But forget all of that for a moment, because we've still got a few images\
  \ to show off from the <a href=\"/products/btpy8xg6\">Skull &amp; Shackles</a> set,\
  \ which will come out in August. With all of the other exciting things happening\
  \ with Pathfinder Battles these days, it's important to remember that Skull &amp;\
  \ Shackles rises the bar from its awesome predecessor <a href=\"/products/btpy8v0b\"\
  >Shattered Star</a>. On its release, I'm confident folks will consider it among\
  \ the very best prepainted plastic miniatures sets ever released. And with a ton\
  \ of aquatic and pirate-themed monsters that have never previously appeared in prepainted\
  \ plastic, I'm confident that most of you are going to adore these figures as much\
  \ as I do.</p> \n     <p>But enough preamble. Raise the mainsail! It's time for\
  \ previews!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-PirateSailor.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-PirateSailor_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>You can't have a pirate Adventure Path without a\
  \ bunch of pirates, and our first preview this week reveals a rank-and-file female\
  \ buccaneer we like to call the Pirate Sailor. It goes without saying that this\
  \ common figure easily doubles as a player character or any kind of nautical NPC.</p>\
  \ \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-Wererat.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-Wererat_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Pirate holds are filled with all kinds of scumbags\
  \ and reprobates, and as far as Pathfinder creatures goes, it's hard to get more\
  \ scummy and reprobatey than a Wererat. Whether paired with the Rat Swarm in this\
  \ set or the Dire Rat in <a href=\"/products/btpy8mq6\">Heroes &amp; Monsters</a>\
  \ or simply encountered on his own, this hybrid-form Wererat is a common figure,\
  \ making it a great foundation of an entire encounter based around wererats. He's\
  \ pretty great in-hand, and a very useful rendition of a frequently encountered\
  \ creature, in the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/skullAndShackles\">Skull\
  \ &amp; Shackles Adventure Path</a> or otherwise.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  /image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-Paeta_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n \
  \    </div> \n     <p>Last up this week is Paeta, an unusual spider creature encountered\
  \ in the Skull &amp; Shackles Adventure Path. To my knowledge, this type of creature\
  \ has never come out in prepainted plastic, and we think she makes a wonderful debut.\
  \ This Large figure is slated at the rare rarity.</p> \n     <p>That's it for this\
  \ week. Only a few more figures to show off before we shift over to <a href=\"/products/btpy909j\"\
  >Legends of Golarion</a> in a couple of weeks!</p> \n     <p>See you here in seven\
  \ days!</p> \n     <p>Captain Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher of the Shackles Isles</i></p>\
