  \ I receive about Pathfinder Society Organized Play, whether it be in person when\
  \ I am visiting different regions, through emails, or on the messageboards, what\
  \ I hear most is that non-convention-goers have little to no chance to obtain some\
  \ of the convention-only boons that are offered at regional shows. The most popular\
  \ of these boons are the racial boons, which open up the player's options to choose\
  \ a unique race. I have thought long and hard on how we can even out things for\
  \ those players who are not able to attend a convention for whatever reason.</span></p>\
  \ \n    <p>First, let me clarify that we will always have special boons that can\
  \ only be obtained at conventions. These will consist of a multitude of various\
  \ options, from extending the range of the Day Job earnings chart to unique races.\
  \ Our regional and national conventions and larger game days are where we garner\
  \ the biggest PR for our game. But that doesn't mean I don't want to offer the chance\
  \ of getting cool boons, especially racial boons, to members of our player base\
  \ who don't attend conventions.</p> \n    <p>At these regional conventions, players\
  \ only receive approximately a 10% chance to receive any boon that is provided at\
  \ the convention. I don't think it is unreasonable to offer a similar chance to\
  \ non-convention players.</p> \n    <p>One tool that has finally been opened to\
  \ me is I am able to filter play of individual scenarios, and to see every reported\
  \ table and every Pathfinder Society number that was at that table. I am also able\
  \ to filter dates so I can see exactly how many tables of a specific scenario were\
  \ reported over a specified time. Playing around with this new tool got me to thinking\
  \ about how I could utilize it for the benefit of the entire Pathfinder Society\
  \ player base.</p> \n    <p>My initial thought is that when a scenario presents\
  \ something unique, such as helping a race like ratfolk, catfolk, or dhampirs (and\
  \ no, I am not advising one way or another whether either of these races will make\
  \ an appearance in Season 5), it might be possible to offer these races (or whatever\
  \ races were aided in a specified scenario) via a lottery type of system. While\
  \ I certainly don't want to flood the OP with a zoo of races (such as making them\
  \ available on a Chronicle sheet for everyone who plays the specified scenario),\
  \ I don't think it is a bad thing to occassionally give a limited pool of players\
  \ the chance to play a new race, similar to the Grippli boon at Gen Con this year,\
  \ as long as we control the flow of how many become available. With that said, my\
  \ thinking is that after the first month or two of a specified scenario, I would\
  \ randomly select from all tables that reported success in the specified scenario.\
  \ All the players and GMs of the randomly selected tables would then have the unique\
  \ Chronicle sheet sent directly to them.</p> \n    <p>Maybe this is or isn't the\
  \ best way to offer unique boons to the entire playerbase, especially those who\
  \ can't or won't attend conventions. However, it is the start of a working idea\
  \ I am still toying with that would offer an equal chance to everyone who plays\
  \ the specified scenario in a specified time limit. If you think this is a horrible\
  \ idea, please offer a solution for how we can make it better. I would very much\
  \ like to hear your feedback on what you think of the above system, or hear your\
  \ thoughts on any other suggestions you might have for how to best utilize this\
  \ new tool I have been given. As always, your feedback and comments help to strengthen\
  \ the community at large, and without your feedback and participation, Pathfinder\
  \ Society wouldn't be as awesome as it is today. I look forward to reading all of\
  \ your comments.</p> \n    <p>Mike Brock<br> <i>Pathfinder Society Campaign Coordinator</i></p>\
