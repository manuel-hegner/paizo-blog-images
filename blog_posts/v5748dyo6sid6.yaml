  \     <p>Before I became president, I was leading negotiations with the UPW to create\
  \ the tabletop industry’s first-ever collective bargaining agreement. This wasn’\
  t an easy task, and we didn’t always see eye-to-eye on all the issues, but we worked\
  \ together for more than a year and found compromises to create an agreement that\
  \ I believe works for both the company and its employees. That’s not the end of\
  \ the process, of course, as the leadership team continues to work with the union\
  \ on many day-to-day matters that running a company requires. </p> \n     <p>We’\
  ve had customers and companies reach out to us in concern about the unionization\
  \ process. Yes, becoming unionized is serious business and brings significant changes,\
  \ but it’s also brought an opportunity for the union and the management team to\
  \ form stronger bonds that will serve us well in the future. To other business leaders\
  \ in the industry who are concerned about unionization, I offer the immortal words\
  \ of Douglas Adams: <em>Don’t Panic!</em></p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Rise of the\
  \ ORC</h3> \n     <p>As some of you noticed earlier this year, there was a thing\
  \ that happened with the Open Gaming License (OGL). Paizo and other publishers made\
  \ the decision to leave the OGL and begin publishing under the Open RPG Creative\
  \ (ORC) license. This wasn’t a decision we took lightly, but Paizo can no longer\
  \ operate under a license that a corporate giant believed they could change, shake\
  \ up, or cancel whenever it wanted to. </p> \n     <p>That decision had other impacts,\
  \ however. <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02d54?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-Abomination-Vaults\"\
  >Abomination Vaults 5E</a>, Starfinder’s <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02eai?Starfinder-Scoured-Stars-Adventure-Path\"\
  >Scoured Stars</a> and Mechageddon! Adventure Paths, the <em>Lost Omens Tian Xia\
  \ Character Guide</em>, and Pathfinder’s <em>Howl of the Wild</em> rulebook all\
  \ had to move to 2024 to make room for the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02ej2?Pathfinder-Player-Core\"\
  ><em>Player Core</em></a> and <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02ej3?Pathfinder-GM-Core\"\
  ><em>GM Core</em></a> ORC Remastered rulebooks coming out in November.</p> \n  \
  \   <p>The shift to the ORC license will also necessitate a change to our Compatibility\
  \ License and Community Use Policy. We’ll have those available for public comment\
  \ soon, and final versions will be released before the new Remaster books come out\
  \ in November. We’re also taking the opportunity to introduce a new fan policy I\
  \ think many artisans are going to love.</p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Reorganizations</h3>\
  \ \n     <p>I’ve been working with other members of Paizo’s leadership team to streamline\
  \ operations throughout the company. The biggest changes have been merging the customer\
  \ service team into the sales team, organized play into the marketing team, and\
  \ the entirety of marketing under the sales and operations teams. These independent\
  \ silos weren’t working the way they should, and now that they’re all under the\
  \ same umbrella, they better share and work toward common goals to support our customers,\
  \ distributors, and local game stores. </p> \n     <p>The creative team also saw\
  \ some changes, primarily merging teams that specialize along narrative (organized\
  \ play scenarios, standalone adventure modules, and Adventure Paths), rules &amp;\
  \ lore (Lost Omens and general Pathfinder rulebooks), and Starfinder lines. We’\
  ve also added the ability for us to create games outside of our traditional RPG\
  \ fold, and you’ll see the first of those efforts, <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02eh8?Pathfinder-Elemental-Stones\"\
  >Elemental Stones</a>, launch this fall. Pre-order it today!</p> \n     <br> \n\
  \     <h3>Mostly Remote</h3> \n     <p>With virtually all of Paizo working remotely\
  \ since the start of the pandemic, we decided that Paizo would remain a remote workforce\
  \ even after most lockdown protocols ended. We’re in the process of closing down\
  \ our Redmond offices and warehouse, and we’ll be moving our warehouse operations\
  \ a few miles up the road to Woodinville over the coming months. Outside the warehouse\
  \ team, Paizo employees have additional states eligible for remote work (currently\
  \ Colorado, Indiana, Maryland, Minnesota, Oregon, and Washington).</p> \n     <p>As\
  \ we vacate the Redmond offices, we’ll likely have some downtime for Paizo.com and\
  \ the forums as we move those servers to a new data center. We’ll let you know about\
  \ that when we get a bit closer to the move.</p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>New Technology</h3>\
  \ \n     <p>We’ve been operating Paizo’s finances on basic software for decades,\
  \ but the time has come to invest in a new platform that can give us the business\
  \ intelligence and integrations we need. Too many people at Paizo spend hours every\
  \ week manually building reports from Excel files, so this change should result\
  \ in a win for everyone. We’re in the final stages of moving over to a shiny new\
  \ financial and analytics platform, which we’ll then use to integrate with a…</p>\
  \ \n     <br> \n     <h3>New Store</h3> \n     <p>Yup. We’ll be replacing the current\
  \ Paizo Store with a shiny new one. We’re still working out timelines for that,\
  \ so stay tuned for future updates. The new finance platform needed to happen first,\
  \ since the store needs to plug into something that can handle all the data. Some\
  \ of the goals of the new store are to: </p> \n     <ol> \n      <li>Provide a responsive\
  \ design across mobile, web, and tablet.</li> \n      <li>Allow for an easy checkout\
  \ process with more payment methods available.</li> \n      <li>Offer a more robust\
  \ reward program than the current Paizo Advantage.</li> \n      <li>Allow for more\
  \ robust subscription options, like the ability to skip a shipment or start with\
  \ a specific book.</li> \n      <li>Allow sidecarts for subscribers.</li> \n   \
  \   <li>Better organization and a Paizo-branded experience.</li> \n     </ol> \n\
  \     <br> \n     <h3>New Forums</h3> \n     <p>The community is important to us,\
  \ and we are investigating new platforms to provide a better forum experience (along\
  \ with preserving the content of the current forums). As we finalize our decision,\
  \ we’ll provide more updates to the community. </p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Licensing</h3>\
  \ \n     <p>Paizo’s goal with licensing is to serve the Pathfinder and Starfinder\
  \ communities with amazing products from partners that resonate with gamers. We\
  \ want to make your game experiences better, whether you play around the table at\
  \ home, across a virtual table, or at your favorite local game store or convention.\
  \ We’re looking for partners with a passion for the Pathfinder and Starfinder brands\
  \ that can bring experiences to you in new ways and attract a wider audience. </p>\
  \ \n     <p>That’s why we partnered with Owlcat on the <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/640820/Pathfinder_Kingmaker__Enhanced_Plus_Edition/\"\
  ><em>Kingmaker</em></a> and <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1184370/Pathfinder_Wrath_of_the_Righteous__Enhanced_Edition/\"\
  ><em>Wrath of the Righteous</em></a> games, and also why we’ve partnered with BKOM\
  \ on <a href=\"https://www.bkomstudios.com/news/battle-endless-waves-of-the-undead-in-pathfinder-gallowspire-survivors/\"\
  ><em>Gallowspire Survivors</em></a> and the <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bkomstudios/pathfinder-abomination-vaults\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder: Abomination Vaults</em></a> ARPG. Not only are these games fun\
  \ for a large number of current Pathfinder and Starfinder players, but they’ll also\
  \ bring in <em>nufriends</em> to experience tabletop for the first time.</p> \n\
  \     <p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bringing those new players into our games means\
  \ making character creation easy, which we’ve done by partnering with <a href=\"\
  https://app.demiplane.com/nexus/pathfinder2e\">Demiplane</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wolflair.com/hlo/\"\
  >Hero Lab Online</a>. We have more work to do for new players, but we’re leveling\
  \ up with new tools and an awesome community to guide them to amazing gaming experiences.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The <a href=\"https://www.pathfinderinfinite.com/\">Pathfinder Infinite</a>\
  \ and <a href=\"https://www.starfinderinfinite.com/\">Starfinder Infinite</a> programs\
  \ have allowed community creators across the world a generous license to produce\
  \ their own Pathfinder and Starfinder material using Paizo’s intellectual property,\
  \ and make money for their efforts. Both communities continue to grow, and we're\
  \ seeing more new, innovative material from Infinite creators every month.</p> \n\
  \     <br> \n     <h3>Pathfinder Fiction</h3> \n     <p>The fiction industry has\
  \ been struggling for years outside a handful of very successful authors, and our\
  \ previous <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Pathfinder-Tales-26-book-series/dp/B08NZ2ZWQ1\"\
  >Pathfinder Tales</a> novels had the same challenges. We’re going to be trying out\
  \ some new strategies to ensure making novels is profitable, but that means we need\
  \ to create one!</p> \n     <p>Novels let us tell stories in ways that our game\
  \ products can’t and can reach a wider audience of fantasy readers, so I’m pleased\
  \ to announce that we’ve greenlit a standalone Pathfinder novel for release in 2024.\
  \ What that novel is about, and who its amazing author is, will be revealed in due\
  \ time—but prepare to be entertained (and for some major, longstanding canon questions\
  \ to be answered)! </p> \n     <p>I’m really excited about the future, and I look\
  \ forward to working with the Paizo team and our community to bring Pathfinder and\
  \ Starfinder to wider audiences. What can you do to help? Take the opportunity to\
  \ invite someone new to your gaming group, never miss another release by <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/store/subscriptions\">signing up for a subscription</a>, make\
  \ a leap into the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/pathfinderSociety/getstarted\">Pathfinder\
  \ Society</a> and <a href=\"https://paizo.com/starfindersociety/getstarted\">Starfinder\
  \ Society</a>, and support your favorite local game store as you continue to explore\
  \ the worlds of Pathfinder and Starfinder.</p> \n     <p>Thanks again for supporting\
  \ Paizo! Here’s to continuing to create lifelong friendships through gaming. </p>\
