  \ Vale Preview</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Wednesday, May 7, 2008</p> \n    <p>We're\
  \ getting ready to send <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy80ib\"><i>Guide to Darkmoon Vale</i></a>\
  \ off to the printer. Here's a brief excerpt about the hated Lumber Consortium to\
  \ whet your appetites until the book hits the shelves.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n\
  \     <h2>Lumber Consortium</h2> \n     <p>A holdover from the days when Andoran\
  \ existed as a province of Cheliax, the Lumber Consortium has watched its fortunes\
  \ and influence wane with the rise of democracy. Although a mere shadow of what\
  \ it was at its height, the Lumber Consortium nonetheless continues to exert incredible\
  \ influence over certain regions and communities, particularly in the wild corners\
  \ of Andoran. Nowhere is this continued power more obvious than in Darkmoon Vale,\
  \ where the consortium's major tree-felling operation occurs.</p> \n     <p><b>Management:</b>\
  \ No one man controls the consortium. A board of directors, all of whom share a\
  \ controlling interest in the endeavor, oversees the operations of the collective,\
  \ forming long-term and large-scale strategies and leaving the day-to-day operations\
  \ to on-site foremen (known as gavels). The powerful and unscrupulous men who sit\
  \ on the board of directors include lumber barons and timber magnates, all of whom\
  \ made their fortunes on the backs of lumberjacks and at the expense of the forests.\
  \ Never a group possessing high moral standards, members of the board have become\
  \ increasingly sadistic and cruel as their power has eroded. Whispers tie a few\
  \ of the directors to the mysteriously sinister Aspis Consortium.</p> \n     <p>Two\
  \ gavels—down from the heyday of the consortium's power, when more than a dozen\
  \ of such men existed—maintain absolute control over the last of the consortium's\
  \ holdings. In Darkmoon Vale, the gavel is Thaldrin Kreed, a hateful and hate-filled\
  \ man whose sadistic and cruel ways keep the town pinned under his callused thumb.\
  \ As a gavel, Thaldrin Kreed has absolute control over the consortium's presence\
  \ in Darkmoon Vale, including its employees and hard assets. As long as he squeezes\
  \ out a larger profit each year, Thaldrin Kreed can do no wrong in the eyes of the\
  \ consortium (whose barristers have saved the gavel from the gallows on at least\
  \ four occasions). With the passage of each year, though, it becomes ever more difficult\
  \ for Kreed to increase his profits, resulting in ever-more horrific displays of\
  \ exploitation and greed.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p> Mike McArtor <br>Editor</p>\
