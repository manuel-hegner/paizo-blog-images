  \ \n    <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, September 13, 2011</p> \n    <p>Ever since we\
  \ announced our Pathfinder Battles prepainted fantasy miniatures line in partnership\
  \ with WizKids, members of the Paizo community have wanted a way to subscribe. Due\
  \ to the special nature of randomly assorted blind-packaged miniatures produced\
  \ by another company, it’s taken us about a month to pull together the appropriate\
  \ website code to make it happen. I’m pleased to announce that today we are ready\
  \ to reveal the Pathfinder Battles subscription plan, as well as some associated\
  \ details about how you can make sure you don’t miss the exciting (and extremely\
  \ limited-edition) <a href=\"/store/byCompany/w/wizKids/featuredBrands/pathfinderMiniatures/v5748btpy8mwc\"\
  >Huge Black Dragon premium miniature</a> from December’s Heroes &amp; Monsters set!\
  \ Best of all, the entire system is ready immediately, and you can <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy8o6b\"\
  >begin your Pathfinder Battles ongoing subscription</a> <i>today</i>!</p> \n   \
  \ <p>Our new <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy8o6b\">Pathfinder Battles ongoing subscription</a>\
  \ allows you to specify the number of cases you would like to receive of each major\
  \ Pathfinder Battles set release. The first set, <a href=\"/store/byCompany/w/wizKids/byProductType/pathfinderMiniatures/v5748btpy8mq6\"\
  >Heroes &amp; Monsters</a> ships in December, with a follow-up set, Rise of the\
  \ Runelords, in June. We currently anticipate that future sets will appear about\
  \ every 4 months.</p> \n    <p>In addition to major randomly packaged sets, WizKids\
  \ plans to release several nonrandom Encounter Packs. These packs are not included\
  \ in your subscription, but your subscription will allow you the opportunity to\
  \ purchase them at reduced cost.</p> \n    <p>Each major Pathfinder Battles set\
  \ will also include at least one limited-edition premium miniature. For Heroes &amp;\
  \ Monsters, the premium miniature is the fearsome Huge Black Dragon ($14.99), usually\
  \ available only to retailers on a 1-per-case basis.</p> \n    <p>Your ongoing Pathfinder\
  \ Battles subscription provides the following benefits:</p> \n    <ul>\n     <li>The\
  \ right to purchase one limited-edition case premium miniature at 75% off its normal\
  \ retail price per case ordered.</li> \n     <li>Discount code good for 20% off\
  \ our price on one Encounter Pack per case ordered.</li> \n     <li>20% off our\
  \ price on paizo.com purchases of loose, unpackaged Pathfinder Battles miniature\
  \ singles to help you fill in your collection.</li>\n    </ul> \n    <p>We expect\
  \ all of our Pathfinder Battles sets to sell out relatively quickly, as the red-hot\
  \ demand for this product has exceeded our expectations. An ongoing Pathfinder Battles\
  \ subscription is your best chance to get the latest figures before they run out!</p>\
  \ <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy8o6b\">Sign up today</a> to ensure that your Pathfinder\
  \ Battles ongoing subscription starts with the very first release, Heroes &amp;\
  \ Monsters. Only those who preorder by October 1st and subscribers will be guaranteed\
  \ a chance to purchase the <a href=\"/store/byCompany/w/wizKids/featuredBrands/pathfinderMiniatures/v5748btpy8mwc\"\
  >Huge Black Dragon</a> premium miniature, so we encourage interested parties to\
  \ preorder or subscribe as soon as they can. We will continue to offer Heroes &amp;\
  \ Monsters as the starting point of your subscription as long as we can guarantee\
  \ that we will have enough premium miniatures to cover subscriber demand. When this\
  \ is no longer the case, we will shift subscriptions to begin with the following\
  \ release.\n    <p></p> \n    <p>We’ve assembled a handy <a href=\"/paizo/faq/v5748nruor1g0\"\
  >Frequently Asked Questions</a> to cover the subscription plan in greater detail,\
  \ and plan to monitor the comment thread of this blog post to handle any questions\
  \ we haven’t thought of yet.</p> \n    <p>Thanks for your patience with us as we’\
  ve put this new subscription option into place. We hope you’ll consider it worth\
  \ the wait. You won’t have to wait much longer, though, for the Heroes &amp; Monsters\
  \ are on the march!</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p> \n   </blockquote>\n\
