  \ for Classic Encounters</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Thursday, September 29, 2016</p>\
  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">This week,\
  \ on my preview for the <a href=\"/products/btpy9nme\">hardcover edition of Curse\
  \ of the Crimson Throne</a>, I wanted to talk a little bit about the new art. When\
  \ preparing this book, Sarah Robinson and I realized something pretty quickly—we\
  \ were going to have to order a LOT of new art. First of all, for modern Adventure\
  \ Paths, we've moved away from vertical half-page illustrations, so all of those\
  \ we used for scenes the first time around were going to have to be re-ordered and\
  \ recreated. Second of all, in those early days, we were still experimenting with\
  \ what the \"Pathfinder Look\" was going to be for our art, and not all of the art\
  \ styles we tried out in those early days are ones that we've stuck with, so that\
  \ made for MORE art we had to re-order and recreate. And finally, we didn't want\
  \ to reprint much art that we'd since used in hardcover books—a fair amount of the\
  \ artwork from Curse of the Crimson Throne actually ended up in the <em>Pathfinder\
  \ RPG Core Rulebook</em>, such as the fight against the giant devilfish (page 185\
  \ of the <em>Core Rulebook</em>), the Red Mantis Cinnabar (page 203), or Eva's first\
  \ design for the Gray Maiden (not only on page 198, but on the back cover of the\
  \ book).</p> \n    <p>In short, we found it really easy to find excuses to add artwork\
  \ to the new book.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderAdventurePath/PZO1021-Half1.jpg\"\

  \    </div> \n    <p>The amount of new artwork in the hardcover edition is enormous,\
  \ with most of the significant NPCs now getting a full body illustration instead\
  \ of a simple portrait, and with additional half-page illustrations for key encounters\
  \ and scenes in the story. And it's those new half-page illustrations I'm going\
  \ to show off today, without context (so as to minimize spoilers) and in some cases\
  \ illustrating brand new encounters in this version of the Adventure Path. One thing\
  \ I will say, though, is that each of these illustrations is taken from one of the\
  \ six parts of the campaign. If you've played Curse of the Crimson Throne before,\
  \ see if you can guess which illustrations come from what part! And if you've never\
  \ played Curse of the Crimson Throne, consider these six images as teasers for the\
  \ perils and excitement that await you!</p> \n    <p>James Jacobs<br> <i>Creative\
