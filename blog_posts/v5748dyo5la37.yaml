  \ border=\"0\" hspace=\"12\" align=\"right\"></a> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>Towers\
  \ is a simple gambling game for two to four players. At the start of the game, six\
  \ special cards are laid out from the <i>Harrow Deck</i>, forming the base of the\
  \ towers. Each player is dealt a hand of three cards. Players take turns placing\
  \ cards from their hand onto the towers, trying to rid themselves of as many cards\
  \ as possible while blocking the way for opponents to do the same. If you can't\
  \ play some of your cards, they accrue as debt owed to the other players. As the\
  \ game progresses it becomes harder and harder to play your cards and your debt\
  \ can really spiral out of control. The game comes to an end when no one can play\
  \ any more cards. At that point, each player's debt is tallied and players must\
  \ pay the difference to those with a lower value. </p> \n   <p>The game is simple\
  \ to learn, but has some complex strategy for those who are eager to fleece their\
  \ opponents. A word of caution: This game can be addictive and I would hate to see\
  \ someone lose a <i>vorpal sword</i> over a few bad hands. </p> \n   <p>Jason Bulmahn<br>\
