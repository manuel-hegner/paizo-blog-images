  \ \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Hope everyone in the northern hemisphere had\
  \ a good end of summer and that our southern hemisphere folks’ winter wasn’t too\
  \ unbearable. We have lots of news, so diving right in!</p> \n     <h2>PAX Unplugged\
  \ 2019</h2> \n     <p>The end of 2019 is in sight and planning for 2020 continues\
  \ apace. PAX Unplugged has room for a few more volunteers. Visit <a href=\"http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/paizo\"\
  >www.organizedplayfoundation.org/paizo</a> for more information or to complete a\
  \ volunteer questionnaire. The organizing committee of Bradley Fiske and Shannon\
  \ Petrosky, advised by Premier Event Team Coordinator Bob Jonquet, will be reaching\
  \ out to volunteer applicants in the near future as plans solidify and schedules\
  \ come together.</p> \n     <h2>Pathfinder Society (second edition) Character Rebuild</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>If you’ve joined us for our first few weeks of the Pathfinder Society\
  \ campaign, you know that we still have a few bugs to work out to get the campaign\
  \ running smoothly. Between improving and fleshing out the Pathfinder Society Guide\
  \ to Play, fixing issues with reporting scenarios, getting the Achievement Points\
  \ chart online, and other bits and pieces that have come up, we’re working hard\
  \ to get the campaign to a place we can all be proud of. On top of all of that,\
  \ we know that players and GMs are all learning an entirely new game system.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>We’d like to give our community time to explore, learn, and not worry\
  \ about looking back on their past character decisions and wishing they had made\
  \ different ones. To that end, we’ll be releasing a free, limited-time boon on the\
  \ Achievement Points chart, which you can apply immediately to rebuild your character.\
  \ The window for applying this boon will close on September 19th. Rebuilding will\
  \ continue to appear on the Achievement Points chart after that date, but it will\
  \ no longer be a free option. </p> \n     <p>Thank you to all our players and GMs\
  \ who jumped in and provided feedback! We cannot have a campaign without you all\
  \ and we greatly value your communication.</p> \n     <h2>Campaign Coins</h2> \n\
  \     <p>We had no new additions to the recipient roster this month. </p> \n   \
  \  <h2>Stars</h2> \n     <p>As we said before, even though publication of Pathfinder\
  \ Society (first edition) scenarios wrapped in July, we are still supporting the\
  \ program. This includes GMs earning their 5th star for running games. This month,\
  \ two GMs obtained their last star. To achieve this milestone, GMs run 150 games,\
  \ of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios, as well\
  \ as run a game for a venture-captain. A conservative estimate of time needed to\
  \ reach 5-stars is 650 hours! To the GMs listed below, thank you very much for the\
  \ time and energy you spend running Pathfinder Society games! Huge kudos on your\
  \ achievement!</p> \n     <p>Maite Donker<br> Aaron Tysen </p> \n     <h2>Novas\
  \ &amp; Glyphs</h2> \n     <p>We’re manually compiling the data from the rubric\
  \ reviews while we work to get the online reporting in place! Please send any reviews\
  \ to <a href=\"mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com\">organizedplay@paizo.com</a>.</p>\
  \ \n     <h2>Convention Listing</h2> \n     <p>We have organized play activities\
  \ at quite a few conventions in the upcoming months, so if you want to get your\
  \ game on, check out the list below! The list includes all the event support requests\
  \ received to date. If you see one missing, ping the organizer and have them submit\
  \ a request for support or have them email me at <a href=\"mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com\"\
  >organizedplay@paizo.com</a> to discuss their event. All of the conventions on the\
  \ list maintain some type of web presence, be it website, social media page, or\
  \ Warhorn listing, so if you are interested in attending in either capacity, check\
  \ out their websites or contact the local venture-officer for more information!</p>\
