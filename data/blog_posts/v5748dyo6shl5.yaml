  \     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Hey everyone! Michael Sayre\
  \ here, ready to discuss the Pathfinder Guns &amp; Gears playtest that just wrapped\
  \ up! We’ve had some time to go over the survey results and contextualize all of\
  \ the amazing posts, videos, and playtest reports you all shared during the course\
  \ of the playtest. Now that we’ve had a chance to go over that data ourselves and\
  \ make some decisions, we’re here to talk to you a bit about the direction we’d\
  \ like to take. Keep in mind, while we’re going to talk about some broad points\
  \ here, there are likely to be dozens of little changes throughout both classes—\
  covering everything from adding more feats and class options to minor tweaks in\
  \ the way existing abilities or options function. Just because we don’t mention\
  \ something here doesn’t mean it won’t get some kind of love and attention during\
  \ development. We’re just hitting the highlight reel! Also, feel free to stick around\
  \ to the end of the blog to check out a preview of one of the cool new options that’\
  ll be included in the final release of Guns &amp; Gears!</p> \n      <h3>Gunslinger</h3>\
  \ <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/f68010b7-5697-402c-8ccc-b840849b0b0d/012221_PZO2109_Gunslinger01.jpg\"\

  \ align=\"left\" width=\"300\" style=\"padding: 10px;\" alt=\"pathfinder guns and\
  \ gears second edition playtest gunslinger iconic with a large rifle over her shoulder\"\
  ></a> \n      <p>Not surprisingly, a lot of the feedback on the gunslinger focused\
  \ on the execution of firearms and the Reload mechanic. We also collected some really\
  \ remarkable data related to the gunslinger ways, so I want to be sure to spend\
  \ some time exploring what that data could mean for us going forward. Finally, I’\
  m going to talk a bit about the types of gear that weren’t present in the playtest,\
  \ but that should have a significant impact thanks to inclusion in the final release.</p>\
  \ \n      <p><b>Firearms</b>: Firearms remain a divisive subject when it comes to\
  \ fantasy roleplaying games, and this particular iteration was no exception, though\
  \ we did learn some interesting information. The first and most relevant data point\
  \ suggests that the version of guns we have in the playtest are far and away the\
  \ most popular choice for how people want to see firearms executed in this edition,\
  \ so we’re going to stick pretty close to that model. That being said, there are\
  \ opportunities for improvement here.</p> \n      <p>The first thing I’ll note is\
  \ that the final version of <em>Guns &amp; Gears</em> is going to have more than\
  \ double the number of firearms than the playtest had. This is going to include\
  \ things like one-handed scatter weapons and guns that fire big, relatively slow-moving\
  \ rounds that have a higher base damage die but no fatal property. We also plan\
  \ to incorporate quite a few other variations on the theme that you’ll have to wait\
  \ to see more of in the final book!</p> \n      <p>We also embraced a conservative\
  \ approach to firearm design going into this playtest, keeping the ranges very tight\
  \ to represent the relative inaccuracy of these kinds of smooth bore weapons and\
  \ using primarily preexisting weapon traits that people already know how to use.\
  \ As we go through and develop all of the firearms, we’ll consider opportunities\
  \ to explore these options: such as extending the range of a few different weapons,\
  \ potentially introducing new traits that do a better job of telling the story of\
  \ a firearm, and addressing small oversights in the playtest options. For example,\
  \ the penalty and action cost for unsteady probably shouldn’t apply to a prone character,\
  \ so adding that clarification should enhance the usability of unsteady weapons\
  \ while also adding interesting new dynamics to feats like Hit the Dirt!</p> \n\
  \      <p><b>Reload</b>: Reload times inspired a lot of constructive debate during\
  \ the playtest. Many people found that they were an important part of the story\
  \ of firearms and greatly preferred the tone and era of weapons we used in the playtest,\
  \ feeling that they were a more natural fit for a fantasy world than things like\
  \ revolvers and cartridge-loaded rifles. Others felt like the action cost of reloading\
  \ was a real stumbling block that got in the way a player making the character they\
  \ wanted. Running Reload was an incredibly popular feat choice for really helping\
  \ people maximize the value of that action. Consequently, we’re looking at granting\
  \ each of the gunslinger ways their own unique Reload action. For example, gunslingers\
  \ who choose the way of the sniper could receive a built-in action to Reload and\
  \ Hide or Take Cover. We’ll also likely use some of the additional feats that will\
  \ appear in the final version of the class to expand your options for more robust\
  \ Reload activities even more, giving gunslingers a highly efficient action economy\
  \ with lots of ways to interact with the battlefield.</p> \n      <p><b>Gunslinger\
  \ Ways</b>: So, normally in any playtest for a class that has multiple “subpath”\
  \ options, there’s a clear first-place choice that selected significantly more often\
  \ by players. That was not the case with the gunslinger ways. While there were small\
  \ variations between the number of people choosing a given way, they were each so\
  \ close to a third of the total respondents that it was clear that each of these\
  \ concepts has just as much draw and appeal as the others. As a result, it’s pretty\
  \ likely that each of these ways will be present in the final release, though with\
  \ some changes informed by the experiences from this playtest. A lot of the feedback\
  \ we received also suggested some possibilities for new ways that weren’t featured\
  \ in the playtest, so we’ll be looking into those as well. Expect these concepts\
  \ to stick around but their execution to evolve in multiple ways (pun intended)\
  \ going forward.</p> \n      <p><b>Gear</b>: This is one area where I wish we’d\
  \ just had a little more time before the playtest to show you what we’ve got lined\
  \ up, as I think that would have had a really positive impact on some playtesters’\
  \ experiences. That said, I think this is as good a place to give you a sneak peek\
  \ at what’s ahead as any. First, let me just say this. Yes, we plan to include bayonets\
  \ in the final release. </p> \n      <p>More than that, we’re looking at an entire\
  \ section of the book that explores black powder and the things you can do with\
  \ it (like leaving a trail of powder you can light on fire to blow up a powder keg)\
  \ and the things you can’t (like igniting it underwater). We are going to include\
  \ cool options and accessories you can use to customize your gun, though, and that’\
  ll feature options for using your preferred weapon in just about any environment,\
  \ including underwater. We’re looking at all kinds of choices for accessories, from\
  \ scopes to holsters, bandoliers to weaponized bipod/tripods, and just about anything\
  \ else you can think of to customize your gunslinger. There’s always going to be\
  \ more cool ideas for a product than you can fit into the page count, but we’ll\
  \ continue to provide players as much variety and as many unique avenues for their\
  \ character builds as we can.</p> \n      <p>And that’s about all I’ve got for you\
  \ at the moment. I’ll pass this over to Mark so he can talk about the inventor!</p>\

  \ <p>Hi everyone! Mark Seifter here for a post-playtest report for the inventor\
  \ class. I want to start off by thanking you all so much for your feedback, and\
  \ especially for the way you've given it to us. At the start of the playtest, I\
  \ mentioned that since we had two playtests so close to each other, we needed the\
  \ community's help to avoid too many circular arguments and focus on new data and\
  \ analyses on various topics. And boy did you deliver! So thank you for giving us\
  \ great data, ideas, and feedback. This helps make it easy for us to follow along\
  \ and incorporate your ideas. In terms of the ratio of insights to arguments, this\
  \ playtest has one of the best I've ever seen, and that starts with you. </p> \n\
  \    <p>Overall people really liked the inventor, almost as much as the swashbuckler\
  \ with a big gap before the summoner, gunslinger, and a few others that are clustered\
  \ below. But that doesn't mean that there aren't things about the class that need\
  \ to change. Brigh knows, I even announced in the “Welcome to the Inventor” thread\
  \ that unstable had to change after we accidentally didn't use the version asked\
  \ about in the survey! Thank you for bearing with me on this journey and also at\
  \ looking past the roughness with unstable to really dig deep on every other aspect\
  \ of the class, which needed a close eye too.</p> \n    <p><b>Unstable</b>: The\
  \ unstable trait will change. My goal is to make the trait present a gamble that\
  \ weighs risk versus reward. Unlike the playtest version, you'll always get to perform\
  \ the action when you take the risk. The gamble will be whether something goes wrong,\
  \ causing something bad to happen in addition to the action succeeding. I have one\
  \ very exciting idea for this that I can't share yet until I'm sure it works. In\
  \ the meantime, if you want to keep playing your inventor in your home game, you\
  \ can just roll the flat check after you use the unstable ability (including the\
  \ first time) to see if you can use it again. I'm hoping the final version will\
  \ be more exciting than that, but that should work okay for now. </p> \n    <p><b>Gadgets</b>:\
  \ We will be adding a fun gadgets feat path for the inventor to make special gadgets\
  \ each day! It won't be mandatory, as most playtesters expressed that they didn’\
  t want it to be. It will be nice to include it as an option so a player can opt\
  \ in to the complexity that comes with having to read through a big gadget section.</p>\
  \ \n    <p><b>Innovations</b>: Playtesters asked for more options for modifications\
  \ and feats for innovations, and the final version will add more of them. All of\
  \ you inventor playtesters really captured the weird science vibe and had some great\
  \ ideas, and I took careful and extensive notes. For example, giving the construct\
  \ companion with a ranged attack a \"turret mode\" option sounds like a lot of fun,\
  \ and playtesters had some great ideas for ways to increase the construct's abilities\
  \ at the expense of the inventor's actions. This helps lend support the playstyle\
  \ of inventors who want to hang back and let the construct do the work. In that\
  \ vein, I'm strongly considering giving the construct innovation inventor the baked\
  \ in ability to spend two actions to give the construct three. This will allow the\
  \ construct to move and Explode, for example, and helps avoid friendly fire.</p>\
  \ \n    <p><b>Overdrive</b>: While the inventor's special powers are dispersed throughout\
  \ several abilities, playtesters were interested in consolidating a little more\
  \ of them into Overdrive, and that's something I'm definitely looking into. If that\
  \ occurs, expect to see Overdrive scale a bit more than it does now, especially\
  \ on a success. Hopefully, I’ll be able to do so just enough to make a big difference.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>These are just a few of the ways in which I'm tinkering and tweaking\
  \ my invention thanks to your notes and efforts. In the end, expect the class to\
  \ look extremely similar to the way it does right now, except with several little\
  \ improvements in almost every area that will really add up in the long run. </p>\
  \ \n    <p>Thanks for reading! For sticking to the end, we’re throwing in an advance\
  \ treat from the book, an intelligent weapon! The final version is very likely to\
  \ be one of the new types of gun in the book, but this version for the blog uses\
  \ the basic pistol so you can throw it into your game right away and have it start\
  \ mouthing off at enemies.</p> \n    <h4>Sunken Pistol — Item 8</h4> \n    <p><b>Rare,\
  \ CN, Arcane, Enchantment, Intelligent</b><br> </p>\n    <p><b>Usage</b> held in\
  \ 1 hand; Bulk 1<br> <b>Perception</b> +12; precise vision 30 feet, imprecise hearing\
  \ 30 feet<br> <b>Communication</b> speech (Common)<br> <b>Skills</b> Intimidation\
  \ +19, Navigation Lore +14, Sailing Lore +14<br> <b>Int</b> +0, <b>Wis</b> +2, <b>Cha</b>\
  \ +4<br> <b>Will</b> +16</p> \n    <p>A <em>sunken pistol</em> is imbued with the\
  \ unfulfilled desires and insatiable greed of its previous wielder, a notorious\
  \ pirate drowned at sea. Once a beautiful and artistically wrought weapon, a <em>sunken\
  \ pistol</em> is coated in a fine layer of dried salt and is encrusted with barnacles.\
  \ Each shot fired from this <em>+1 striking flintlock pistol</em> is coated in a\
  \ layer of salty ectoplasm, and has the effects of a ghost touch rune. You can shoot\
  \ the <em>sunken pistol</em> underwater, even when using black powder ammunition.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>A <em>sunken pistol</em> urges you to amass a horde of treasure even\
  \ a dragon would be proud of. The methods used to acquire these riches matter not\
  \ to the greedy pirate pistol, so long as you amass and hoard excessive wealth.\
  \ Above all else, a <em>sunken pistol</em> desires the return of its own treasure,\
  \ which might rest in the wreck of its sunken ship’s hold or be hidden on a dangerous\
  \ island.</p> \n    <p>In pursuit of treasure, a <em>sunken pistol</em> offers nautical\
  \ and navigation advice to you, though it refuses such aid during less lucrative\
  \ ventures. If you prove a profitable partner, the <em>sunken pistol</em> aids you\
  \ in combat by Demoralizing your opponents (see the first Activation below). If\
  \ you prove charitable or unwilling to retrieve its treasure, the <em>sunken pistol</em>\
  \ turns its ire on you, Demoralizing you during combat until you relent. If you\
  \ repeatedly refuse the <em>sunken pistol</em>, it would be wise to not accept <em>water\
  \ breathing</em> from it, as it might attempt to drown you to allow a more suitable\
  \ wielder to acquire it from your corpse. The sunken pistol can use the following\
  \ activations.</p> \n    <p><b>Activate</b> [one-action] command; <b>Frequency</b>\
  \ once per minute; <b>Effect</b> The <em>sunken pistol</em> curses and insults a\
  \ creature it can see, attempting an Intimidation check to Demoralize that creature.</p>\
  \ \n    <p><b>Activate</b> [three-actions] command; <b>Frequency</b> once per day;\
  \ <b>Effect</b> The <em>sunken pistol</em> casts <em>water breathing</em> on you\
  \ as a 3rd-level arcane spell. The <em>sunken pistol</em> can Dismiss this spell,\
  \ so be sure to keep the gun happy if you’re relying on its good graces to breathe!</p>\
