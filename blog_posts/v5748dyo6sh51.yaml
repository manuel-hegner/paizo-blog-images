  \  <p><i>Legacy of the Lost God</i> is a Pathfinder adventure written by Jenny Jarzabski\
  \ for four 5th-level characters. This adventure continues the Extinction Curse Adventure\
  \ Path, a six-part, monthly campaign in which the heroes lead a traveling circus\
  \ as they unravel a plot to eradicate all life from the islands of the Inner Sea.\
  \ This adventure also includes information about catfolk of Golarion and the villainous\
  \ xulgaths, as well as new monsters and circus-themed rules.</p> \n     <p>For some,\
  \ that is as much of a reveal as you want and you might want to go and back and\

  \ Wonders arrives in bustling Escadar, eager for fortune and fame. The heroes must\
  \ confront foul forces in a buried temple to learn more about the looming threat\
  \ facing the Starstone Isles. Their investigations put the heroes on a collision\
  \ course with their circus’s greatest rival: the cruel catfolk Mistress Dusklight,\
  \ ringmaster of the Celestial Menagerie! The Extinction Curse Adventure Path continues\
  \ with “Legacy of the Lost God,” a complete adventure for 5th- to 8th-level characters.”\

  \ the most player-friendly lore in this volume is the <i>Catfolk of Golarion</i>\
  \ article by David N. Ross.</p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p>“With many of the\
  \ most prominent physical features of felines, catfolk make an impression virtually\
  \ everywhere they are encountered—which is all over, considering their propensity\
  \ for travel and adventure. In addition to catlike personality features such as\
  \ curiosity and pride, they have a rich shared culture and often know much more\
  \ about the situations they find themselves in than they let on. Indeed, the story\
  \ of catfolk is a story of nobility and confidence, of wit and guile, and of exploration\
  \ and friendship to the highest degree.</p> \n      <p>While catfolk are well known\
  \ for their strong sense of individuality, they share a number of common characteristics\
  \ that differentiate them from other people of Golarion. They are almost universally\
  \ curious, making them natural adventurers and voyagers as well as scholars and\
  \ researchers. Many are gregarious and talkative—social traits reinforced by upbringings\
  \ that emphasize strong bonds with close friends, whom catfolk refer to as their\
  \ found kin. They are equally at home in cities as well as in the wild, though their\
  \ tendency to inadvertently meddle in others’ affairs sometimes pushes them to the\
  \ fringes of non-catfolk societies, where they socialize with similarly capricious\
  \ people such as tengus and kitsunes.”</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>For more\

  \ deeper, some Game Masters who don’t intend to run this Adventure Path might want\
  \ to adapt or adopt this troglodyte lore for their campaign. Enjoy this excerpt\
  \ from <i>Among The Xulgaths</i> by Andrew Mullen.</p> \n     <blockquote> \n  \
  \    <p>“None of Golarion’s Darklands denizens are as prolific— or as underestimated—\
  as xulgaths. Called troglodytes by the surface‐dwellers who see them as little more\
  \ than foul‐smelling brutes, these lizard‐like humanoids once ruled a vast empire\
  \ beneath Golarion’s surface during the Age of Legends, and powerful xulgath psychic\
  \ leaders commanded legions of formidable warriors amid grand obsidian temples and\
  \ stone ziggurats. Now, xulgath civilization—if it can even be called that—exists\
  \ in disparate fragments spread throughout the Darklands and in the dark corners\
  \ of the world’s outer crust, and craven groups of scavengers, backstabbers, and\
  \ cannibals fight among themselves for control of petty caverns and scraps of food.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Ancient xulgath civilization spread from a massive subterranean vault\
  \ called Vask, in the deepest layer of the Darklands, Orv. In the time of xulgath\
  \ dominance, Vask was filled with lush vegetation and kept safe from the Darklands’\
  \ ambient radioactive energies by the nurturing glow of six mysterious orbs known\
  \ as \"cavern hearts.\" Beneath this quickening luminescence, the xulgaths thrived,\
  \ establishing large communities around mysterious stepped pyramids. Impressive\
  \ aqueducts, fungus farms, and vermin ranches supported the xulgaths’ orderly—if\
  \ bloody— society as it spread throughout the vault.”</p> \n     </blockquote> \n\
