  \ <p itemprop=\"description\">By my count, we've got 11 figures left to preview\
  \ for November's <a href=\"/products/btpy9kcu\"><em>Deadly Foes</em></a> set of\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder Battles</a> prepainted plastic gaming\
  \ figures. I've decided to break down those figures over three different previews\
  \ in the coming weeks, with this being the first of the \"home stretch.\" After\
  \ that, I have piles and piles of even newer stuff to show off, but that's getting\
  \ a bit ahead of myself. Some of my favorite figures in <a href=\"/products/btpy9kcu\"\
  ><em>Deadly Foes</em></a> have yet to make their preview debut, so before we get\
  \ to 2017 stuff, let's take a breath and appreciate the wonders yet to come in 2016.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160916-SewerBeast.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160916-SewerBeast_360.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>First up this week is the Sewer Beast, a beloved (and re-named)\
  \ creature from the very first <a href=\"/products/btpy8auu\"><em>Pathfinder RPG\
  \ Bestiary</em></a>! This popular denizen of dungeons and sewers alike makes his\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder Battles</a> debut with art inspired\
  \ by Wayne Reynolds's cover of <a href=\"/products/btpy81xw\"><em>Pathfinder Adventure\
  \ Path #7: Edge of Anarchy</em></a>, which we're reprinting next month as part of\
  \ the incredible <a href=\"/products/btpy9nme/\">Curse of the Crimson Throne Adventure\
  \ Path hardcover</a>. Those of you playing that epic campaign will find this a most\
  \ helpful miniature indeed, as will anyone whose adventures routinely take them\
  \ to the smellier part of a city's infrastructure. My favorite part of this figure\
  \ are the eyestalks, complete with their very own tampo'd eyes. Spooky! The Sewer\
  \ Beast is a Large, uncommon figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n   \

  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Gamers have been asking for proteans in <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\"\
  >Pathfinder Battles</a> for ages, and I'm happy to report that <a href=\"/products/btpy9kcu\"\
  ><em>Deadly Foes</em></a> gives us our first opportunity to answer those prayers\
  \ directly, and in the best possible way! Again using classic Wayne Reynolds Pathfinder\
  \ art as inspiration (this time the cover of <a href=\"/products/btpy87uz\"><em>The\
  \ Great Beyond</em></a>), WizKids's talented digital artists have brought this creature—\
  completely original to Pathfinder—to three glorious dimensions. I'm thrilled with\
  \ the complex color guide (seven different colors on this one!), and overall the\
  \ final figure is just delightful to drop on the table. There will definitely be\
  \ more proteans to come, but we had to begin with the one that started it all! The\
  \ Keketar Protean is a Large, rare figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160916-ArcanePillar.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160916-ArcanePillar_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Just last week, in the FANTASTIC and VERY HELPFUL thread\
  \ of minis suggestions that accompanied the weekly preview blog (we're seriously\
  \ stealing at least a dozen figure ideas from that thread), at least one poster\
  \ mentioned the need for regular old pillars as dungeon dressing in a future <a\
  \ href=\"/pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder Battles</a> set. While I'm not sure the\
  \ glowing runes on this Arcane Pillar count as a \"regular\" pillar (you'll have\
  \ to wait for the NEXT set for that!), I can deliver a pillar of some kind much\
  \ sooner than many of you probably anticipated. With glowing runes along one side,\
  \ the Arcane Pillar makes a versatile piece that can be used in just about any dungeon\
  \ encounter. I like the idea of running a gauntlet of three sets of these, in which\
  \ crossing the plane of the inward-facing runes causes some kind of horrific magical\
  \ effect. Fun! The Arcane Pillar is a randomly inserted dungeon dressing piece that\
  \ takes the place of an uncommon figure. While collation is never guaranteed, the\
  \ idea is that each case should include at least one of them.</p> \n    <p>And that's\
  \ it for this week, leaving us two more four-figure previews for <a href=\"/products/btpy9kcu\"\
  ><em>Deadly Foes</em></a> in the weeks to come.</p> \n    <p>Feel free to keep posting\
  \ figure suggestions to the comments. Mike and I read them assiduously and will\
  \ definitely consider them for the setlist we're currently building.</p> \n    <p>Thanks\
  \ again for your interest in and support of the <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder\
  \ Battles</a>. It's a labor of love for everyone involved, and your support makes\
  \ it possible.</p> \n    <p>See you next week!</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p>\
