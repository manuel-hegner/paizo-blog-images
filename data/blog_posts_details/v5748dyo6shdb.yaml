  alt: "A female half-orc pirate captain and a white-skinned male human adventurer\
    \ with a scar across his face are having a heated discussion over a war map in\
    \ a cramped ship’s cabin. A somber-looking male dwarf with ruddy skin and fine\
    \ armor looks on, while a female elf with dark skin reads a scroll, seemingly\
    \ oblivious to what’s going on around her"
