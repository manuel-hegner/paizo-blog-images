  \   </div> \n   <h1>Pathfinder Battles Preview: Spidery Secrets!</h1> \n   <p class=\"\
  date\">Friday, November 17, 2011</p> \n   <p>With the very first Pathfinder prepainted\
  \ miniatures, <a href=\"/store/byCompany/w/wizKids/featuredBrands/pathfinderMiniatures/v5748btpy8l52\"\
  >Pathfinder Beginner Box Heroes</a>, in stores now, interest in the <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids\"\
  >Pathfinder Battles</a> miniatures line has really heated up. Now that many of you\
  \ have our first four miniatures in hand, it should be clear that WizKids is shooting\
  \ for very high quality sculpts and paint jobs on all of the Pathfinder Battles\
  \ miniatures. I think <a href=\"/store/byCompany/w/wizKids/featuredBrands/pathfinderMiniatures/v5748btpy8mq6\"\
  >Heroes &amp; Monsters</a> keeps up (and in some cases exceeds) the high quality\
  \ standards set by <a href=\"/store/byCompany/w/wizKids/featuredBrands/pathfinderMiniatures/v5748btpy8l52\"\
  >Beginner Box Heroes</a>, and in a few short weeks, you’ll be able to see what I’\
  m talking about with your own eyes.</p> \n   <p>Until then, we’ve got more previews\
  \ to reveal! The early January release date for Pathfinder Battles <a href=\"/store/byCompany/w/wizKids/featuredBrands/pathfinderMiniatures/v5748btpy8mq6\"\
  >Heroes &amp; Monsters</a> is fast approaching, and I find that we’ve pretty much\
  \ announced all of the 40 miniatures in the set. I wanted to include at least one\
  \ complete surprise this week, and this penultimate look brings us a single miniature\
  \ away from a complete set reveal. We’ll get to that last one next week or beyond,\
  \ but for now, let’s look at some creepy critters from <a href=\"/store/byCompany/w/wizKids/featuredBrands/pathfinderMiniatures/v5748btpy8mq6\"\
  >Heroes &amp; Monsters</a>!</p> \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    <a href=\"\
  /image/content/Blog/111711-Spider_360.jpeg\"><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/111711-Spider_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n   </div> \n   <p>First up we have the Giant Spider, a nasty,\
  \ poisonous fellow who clocks in at the common rarity. Bright red coloration is\
  \ nature’s way of saying “I’m going to kill you,” and in this regard the Giant Spider\
  \ is just as deadly as the bright red <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lcty\">Venomous\
  \ Snake</a> we showed off a couple of weeks ago. Don’t forget your antivenom!</p>\
  \ \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/111711-Skeleton_360.jpeg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/111711-Skeleton_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n \
  \  </div> \n   <p>This Skeleton makes a good buddy for the Giant Spider, in that\
  \ they’d both probably feel at home in the same sort of desolate dungeon environments.\
  \ They also both make excellent adversaries for low-level adventurers. Both of them\
  \ are commons. Many of the folks here in the office who see the Skeleton say, “\
  wow, he looks just like he stepped out of a Ray Harryhausen movie!” Which is nice\
  \ to hear, as it’s exactly what we were going for. If you look closely you can see\
  \ a nice inking effect that WizKids added to the Skeleton’s shield to better sell\
  \ the wood grain. It looks wonderful in person.</p> \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n    <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/111711-Caveweaver_360.jpeg\"><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/111711-Caveweaver_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n   </div> \n   <p>Sure, a Medium Giant Spider is cool, but\
  \ take it from me. A Large Giant Caveweaver Spider is much, much cooler. This guy\
  \ absolutely towers over lesser spiders, and he’s even been useful in scaring a\
  \ few of our “adult” employees who have a very childish reaction to spiders (I’\
  m looking at you, Bulmahn). Heh, heh, heh. Though you can’t quite see it in these\
  \ photographs, the Giant Caveweaver Spider has a really cool red design on its back\
  \ that is sure to have your player characters (and Jason Bulmahn) scampering for\
  \ the exit. Everyone will be glad to hear that this is a rare miniature, so it’\
  ll thankfully be a long time before these guys overrun the Earth.</p> \n   <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/111711-Lineup_360.jpeg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/111711-Lineup_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n   </div>\
  \ \n   <p>Lastly, I wanted to provide a group photo of this week’s previews, so\
  \ you can get a sense of just how huge that Giant Caveweaver Spider really is. Imagine\
  \ that the Skeleton is the same height as a normal man, and you’ll get a strong\
  \ idea that messing around with the Giant Caveweaver is a really, really bad idea!</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Ok, ok, ok. I hear the skeptics already. There’s nothing terribly revolutionary\
  \ about spiders and skeletons, no matter how cool they might look.</p> \n   <p>To\
  \ which I say, fair enough. So next week, I’m going to show you a \n    <link>Heroes\
  \ &amp; Monsters figure with a feature unlike anything you’ve seen before in a prepainted\
  \ miniature! I still can’t believe how awesome and innovative it is, and it’s been\
  \ sitting on my desk for a month!</p> \n   <p>As usual, I’ll try to monitor the\
  \ discussion thread here on the blog. Let me know if there’s anything in particular\
  \ you’d like to see from the set, and I will make sure we cover it shortly!</p>\
