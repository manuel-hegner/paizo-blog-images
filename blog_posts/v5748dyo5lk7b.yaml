  >The first hardback sourcebook for Starfinder is <a href=\"/products/btpy9ujg?Starfinder-Alien-Archive\"\
  ><em>Alien Archive</em></a>, a book with scores of npcs and monsters drawn from\
  \ numerous species and rules for creating brand new creatures. That obviously makes\
  \ it a book GMs are going to get a lot of use out of. But there's a great deal more\
  \ to it than just a bestiary of space monsters. <em>Alien Archive</em> has lots\
  \ of additional material that's useful to players, from new player character races\
  \ to new equipment options and even a whole set of summoning spell rules.</p> \n\
  \    <p>While there are stat blocks appropriate for GM use with every species, 22\
  \ of them also give the traits that allow the creation of player characters of that\
  \ race. The races that receive the racial traits to allow them to be used as player\
  \ characters (along with their size when it is different from Medium, and their\
  \ type and subtype if any) are: barathu (aberration), contemplative (monstrous humanoid),\
  \ draelik (humanoid, draelik), dragonkin (Large dragon), drow (humanoid, elf), formian\
  \ (monstrous humanoid), space goblin (small humanoid, goblin), gray (small humanoid,\
  \ gray), haan (Large monstrous humanoid), ikeshti (small humanoid, ikeshti), kalo\
  \ (monstrous humanoid, aquatic), maraquoi (humanoid, maraquoi), nuar (monstrous\
  \ humanoid), reptoid (humanoid, reptoid, shapechanger), ryphorian (humanoid, rhyphorian),\
  \ sarcesian (Large humanoid, sarcesian), shobhad (Large monstrous humanoid), skittermander\
  \ (Small humanoid, skittermander), urog (Large magical beast), veranthi (humanoid,\
  \ veranthi), witchwyrd (monstrous humanoid), and wrikreechee (monstrous humanoid,\
  \ aquatic). While some of those races are familiar to players from Pathfinder or\
  \ earlier Starfinder products, others appear here for the first time.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>As a sample of the new kinds of creatures available to players, here are the\
  \ racial traits for wrikreechees, chitinous natives of the watery planet of Akchios.</p>\

  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <h3>Wrikreechee Racial Traits</h3> \n     <p class=\"\
  stat-block-1\"><b>Ability Adjustments</b>: +2 Con, +2 Int, -2 Dex</p> \n     <p\
  \ class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Hit Points</b>: 4</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"\
  ><b>Size and Type</b>: Wrikreechees are Medium monstrous humanoids with the aquatic\
  \ subtype.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Amphibious</b>: Wreikreechees\
  \ are able to breath both water and air normally.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block\"\
  ><b>Cooperative (Ex)</b>: Wrikreechees spend much of their lives in close contact\
  \ with one another, learning to predict their neighbors' reactions and coordinate\
  \ their actions.\LA wrikreechee gains a +2 bonus to skill checks for the aid another\
  \ action and to attack rolls to provide harrying fire. A creature using the aid\
  \ another action to assist a wrikreechee's skill check gains a +2 bonus to her check.</p>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"stat-block\"><b>Darkvision</b>: Wrikreechees have darkvision\
  \ with a range of 60 feet.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block\"><b>Sheltering (Ex)</b>:\
  \ A wrikreechee instinctively knows how to exploit sources of cover. When a wrikreechee\
  \ is benefiting from partial cover, cover, or improved cover, the granted bonus\
  \ to its AC and Reflex saves increases by 1. Snag (Ex): Thanks to the feathery material\
  \ lining its forelimbs, a wrikreechee is adept at grabbing small prey. A wrikreechee\
  \ gains a +4 bonus to attack rolls when attempting to grapple a creature smaller\
  \ than itself. As a full action, a wrikreechee can make two attempts to grapple\
  \ a creature with a -4 penalty to the attack rolls.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block\"\
  ><b>Wrikreechee Movement</b>: A wrikreechee has a base speed of 20 feet and a swim\
  \ speed of 30 feet.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <div class=\"blurb180\">\n   \

  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Beyond the expansion of 22 new players races, many of\
  \ the creature entries also include equipment that can potentially be made from\
  \ a slain monster (such as the bones cestuses that can be crafted from a crest-eater),\
  \ or that is an advanced item most often found in the possession of members of a\
  \ specific race (such as the grays' memory expunger) or even a whole new kind of\
  \ technology (such as the nuar's multifunction maze-core technology). Each piece\
  \ of new equipment is tied to a new race in some specific way, allowing players\
  \ to know what kinds of gear is preferred by members of various races, or to allow\
  \ them to benefit from overcoming foes that can be usefully turned into equipment\
  \ that may not otherwise be available.</p> \n    <p>Finally, <em>Alien Archive</em>\
  \ includes the summon creature variable-level spell, which is available to both\
  \ mystics and technomancers. This spells allows spellcasters to select four types\
  \ of planar creatures that can be summoned, ranging from angels, devils, and other\
  \ outsiders to elementals, shadow creatures, or even beasts from the First World\
  \ (only for mystics) or robots drawn from pieces scattered through the Astral Plane\
  \ (only for technomancers). Where appropriate, specific creatures from the <em>Alien\
  \ Archive</em> are available as choices to be summoned by the spell, but a series\
  \ of simple templates ensures a wide range of generic outsiders can also be called\
  \ upon. If a mystic wants to focus on summoning good outsiders, it's possible to\
  \ have an agathion, angel, archon, and azata at every spell level the mystic can\
  \ cast summon creature.</p> \n    <p>While not every player may wish to use equipment\
  \ from distant cultures, and GMs may not make all the new potential player character\
  \ races available in every campaign, the ability to have new life forms and new\
  \ civilizations impact player options is an important part of the information presented\
  \ in <a href=\"/products/btpy9ujg?Starfinder-Alien-Archive\"><em>Alien Archive</em></a>.</p>\
