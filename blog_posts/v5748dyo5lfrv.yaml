  \ \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">A few weeks ago, most of the Pathfinder\
  \ Adventure Card Game development team landed in Dallas with a mission: to play\
  \ all 30 sessions of the <i>Rise of the Runelords</i> campaign by the end of BoardGameGeek.Con.\
  \ That meant six sessions a day for five days, playing adventures we hadn't opened\
  \ since the playtests in February. For us, it was a trip down memory lane.</span></p>\
  \ \n    <p>But for more than a hundred gamers, it was an exposure to the future\
  \ of the game. Sure, they knew how to beat goblins. Staring down gargantuan dragons,\
  \ giant thaumaturges, and succubus queens was another matter entirely. </p> \n \
  \   <p>We'd built six characters: Valeros, Merisiel, Lem, Ezren, Kyra, and Harsk.\
  \ Developer Paul Peterson arrived a day late, so he didn't get to make his personal\
  \ favorite character, Lini. (This was a tactical decision on my part: If we included\
  \ Lini, Paul would never let anyone else play her.) With our sextet ready to go,\
  \ we waded into BGG.Con hoping to find some people who wanted to play a game with\
  \ us.</p> \n    <p>Developer Tanis O'Connor had built us a schedule which we intended\
  \ to carefully adhere to—and then I blew it out of the gate by launching the Attack\
  \ on Sandpoint an hour early. Tanis is used to this. I'm not the easiest person\
  \ to keep on a timetable.</p> \n    <p>Within an hour, our Wednesday signups were\
  \ overflowing. We barreled through \"Burnt Offerings\", teaching new players and\
  \ giving veterans a chance to show off their skill. But then our big problem evinced\
  \ itself: At this breakneck pace, with new players at every session, the characters\
  \ were getting to be…odd. Good, solid boons were being chucked in the box in favor\
  \ of flashy cards. And that meant one thing: Suddenly, we were losing games.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>We back-to-back nosedived the last two \"Burnt Offerings\" scenarios,\
  \ Approach to Thistletop and Thistletop Delve. In the Delve, my team ended with\
  \ villain-fail with two cards in the blessings deck, then villain-fail with one\
  \ card in the blessings deck. It was brutal. Tanis said, “We have no time to die!”\
  \ We resolved that we wouldn't lose again all weekend.</p> \n    <p>So between scenarios\
  \ of \"The Skinsaw Murders\" on Thursday, we looked at the character rebuilds and\
  \ see if we could make a few strategic decisions. Harsk didn't need another Potion\
  \ of Healing as much as he needed a Spyglass. The Merisiel player—whoever that was\
  \ at the time—kept tossing out Ilsoari Gandethus, and developer Chad Brown kept\
  \ tossing him back in. Auto-evading the Sandpoint Devil is something that can't\
  \ be overvalued.</p> \n    <p>And then some crazy stuff started happening. In Them\
  \ Ogres Ain't Right, the first scenario of \"Hook Mountain Massacre\", Paul found\
  \ the villain on turn 1 with an Augury. In the next scenario, Here Comes the Flood,\
  \ we rescued 13 of the 15 available allies through blind luck. Then in Battle at\
  \ the Dam, Paul's team closed three locations on the first three turns.</p> \n \
  \   <p>And all of that paled to my tweet during \"Hook Mountain Massacre's\" final\
  \ scenario, Into the Mountains: “First turn villain, third turn villain, fourth\
  \ turn villain.” Gah.</p> \n    <p>On Friday afternoon, the convention stopped briefly\
  \ for a moment of silence for the 50th anniversary of JFK's assassination. You don't\
  \ realize how loud 3,000 gamers are until they all decide to hush themselves at\
  \ once. Quite the moment.</p> \n    <p>Back at the table, we were cruising. We had\
  \ a few touch-and-go sessions during adventure 4, \"Fortress of the Stone Giants\"\
  . The Black Tower nearly killed a couple of characters, with its overabundance of\
  \ harpies and difficult locations. (You are not going to like the combo of Courtyard\
  \ and Giant Lair, I promise you.) But going into Friday night, we were feeling confident\
  \ of our chances to complete the marathon on time, with no casualties.</p> \n  \
  \  <p>Then, oh yeah, \"Sins of the Saviors\" did its level best to shatter that\
  \ confidence. Adventure 5's scenario Rimeskull is a weird one, with lots of big\
  \ stone heads blowing up all around us. We were ripping through it, looking like\
  \ we'd have a victory with 15 blessings to go – until we weren't. Like by a lot.\
  \ We had our first encounter with a big-time dragon, and it broke us over and over.\
  \ Suddenly, we were staring at one card in the blessings deck and a unpromising\
  \ sink-or-swim roll in my hands. I nailed it by 1.</p> \n    <p>And now we were\
  \ racing a different threat: the weather. On Saturday night, Dallas was being hit\
  \ by an improbable ice storm, and flights were being cancelled all over the place.\
  \ Now we didn't know if we'd even have people around to play. But we weren't going\
  \ to let a little hail (in Dallas!) take us out. Our characters were now titans,\
  \ bristling with artifacts and the favor of the gods.</p> \n    <p>It was fitting\
  \ that the impending blizzard mirrored our most difficult task of the weekend, Sunday\
  \ morning's scenario 3 of \"Spires of Xin-Shalast\". That's called Scaling the Mhar\
  \ Massif, a giant mountain cliff, and it's terrifying. There's a location called\
  \ the Death Zone, and – no, check that. There are <i>many</i> locations called the\
  \ Death Zone, and they lived up to their name. Harsk, Ezren, and Lem were all at\
  \ next-turn-we-die when we hit the top of the peak.</p> \n    <p>With the convention\
  \ closing around us, we assayed our last task, Into the Eye. This is a make-or-break\
  \ throwdown against Karzoug the Claimer, who is the toughest thing in the game.\
  \ The scenario rips your cards away from you, so much so that TableTop producer\
  \ Boyan Radakovich realized that he might die <i>before he took his first turn</i>.\
  \ We really didn't have a chance against Karzoug, with all of us at death's door,\
  \ until by some miracle we skated out with a victory just as they were turning off\
  \ the lights.</p> \n    <p>Amazingly, we realized that we'd just played almost 60\
  \ hours of gameplay, and never once got tired of the game we were playing. We have\
  \ more than 100 people to thank for playing with us (especially our handler, Felipe!),\
  \ and we hope to try it again with Skull &amp; Shackles next year. Thanks for having\
  \ us, BGG.Con!</p> \n    <p>Mike Selinker<br> <i>Designer, Pathfinder Adventure\
