  /pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder Battles</a> set, and until they do (which should\
  \ happen imminently, but at this point is unlikely before the Christmas holiday)\
  \ I can't show off any of the numerous awesome images I'd love to unleash on you\
  \ as a special gift from Santa.</p> \n    <p>But leaking images out of the elves'\
  \ workshop before their time is a good way to disappear in a suspicious sleigh accident,\
  \ so I'm afraid there's nothing I can do but look over these images myself and smile\
  \ about what's in store.</p> \n    <p>What is in store, you ask? Let's do a quck\
  \ recap of what we (I) know so far:</p> \n    <ol>\n     <li> <p itemprop=\"description\"\
  >Starting in January we've got at least six monthly <a href=\"/products/btpy98sw\"\
  >Iconic Heroes Sets</a>, each featuring six premium sculpts with premium paint jobs\
  \ and six exclusive cards for use with the smash hit <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame\"\
  >Pathfinder Adventure Card Game</a>. We've already revealed the contents of the\
  \ first three sets in digital form. For the first set, we've shown every step in\
  \ the process, from digital sculpt to paint master to final production figures.\
  \ I'm looking at my own sample of those final figures right now, and I'm still amazed\
  \ we were able to pull of the quality of detail on the set. It's really going to\
  \ set a new standard for paint application on prepainted figures.</p> <p>Folks have\
  \ been asking for nonrandom \"visible\" prepainted plastic figures since the very\
  \ beginning, and at least as far as <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder Battles</a>\
  \ is concerned, this is exactly what people have been demanding from the start.\
  \ I certainly hope all advocates for the line have plans to buy these. If for whatever\
  \ reason they don't sell well, I think it's fair to say we'll probably never see\
  \ another release like this in the future.</p> <p>No pressure.</p> <p>We're currently\
  \ shipping the most recent full set, <a href=\"/products/btpy96kb\"><em>The Lost\
  \ Coast</em></a>, to positive reviews. If you're considering an <a href=\"/products/btpy8o6b\"\
  >Ongoing Pathfinder Battles Subscription</a>, now would be a great time to sign\
  \ up. Subscribers who have had at least one full release ship to them will be eligible\
  \ for a 30% discount on <a href=\"/products/btpy98sw\">Iconic Heroes</a> sets. In\
  \ order to unlock this discount for the first set, which releases in late January,\
  \ you've got to have a full set ship before then. No time like the present for a\
  \ present to youself!</p></li> \n     <li><p>We currently plan to release two full\
  \ sets in 2015, one in the Spring and one in the Winter. I've approved paint masters\
  \ for the entire Spring set, and I've got to say it includes some of my favorite\
  \ models we've produced to date. This will be the first set to benefit from digital\
  \ sculpts, and the degree of control that's given us over fine details is really\
  \ staggering. As usual, this set will \"flesh out\" a couple of key monster types\
  \ (including a major one people have been demanding from the start, but which we've\
  \ not yet included in a single set).</p> <p>Both sets will include a type of figure\
  \ we've also never done before, and these special figures will be in addition to\
  \ the normal number of figures per set (45). I can't reveal more on pain of death,\
  \ but this is one of the elements I'm most excited to share with you.</p></li> \n\
  \     <li><p>The second set in 2015 is currently scheduled to include a VERY special\
  \ case incentive figure unlike anything we've ever done before. I'm super stoked\
  \ about it. It's so special that it may not happen. The workshop elves are still\
  \ measuring and evaluating, but ooooh, boy it'll be awesome. We're in the process\
  \ of reviewing digital sculpts from this set.</p></li> \n     <li><p>The line is\
  \ healthy, and we're continuing to plan into 2016 and beyond. I'm currently pulling\
  \ together the set list for the first 2016 set, and am always looking for new ideas\
  \ to fill in the blank spots.</p> <p>What figures are you especially hoping we include\
  \ in future sets? I'll give some oblique hints in the comments below if people make\
  \ particularly good guesses, and I look forward to translating some of your suggestions\
  \ into the setlists I'm working on now! Help a brother out!</p></li>\n    </ol>\
  \ \n    <p>Things are going to go dark here in the Friday Publisher Preview for\
  \ the next two weeks as the Publisher takes a much-needed winter vacation. We'll\
  \ be back on January 9, and I certainly hope I have some cool new images to reveal\
  \ then.</p> \n    <p>In the meantime, have a very Merry Christmas, and try to get\
  \ some gaming in over the holidays!</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p>\
