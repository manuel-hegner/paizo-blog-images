  \ \n   <p><span itemprop=\"description\">If you heard the trumpeting and roar of\
  \ cheers last week, that was us, as we just sent our first hardcover of 2013, <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy8vdl\"><i>Ultimate Campaign</i></a>, off to the printer.\
  \ This is just the beginning of that book's long journey from the realm of electronic\
  \ files into the real world, but now that it's out of our hands we can start sharing\
  \ some of the secrets locked away within this guide to greater gaming.</span></p>\
  \ \n   <p>So, without too many spoilers, here are ten tantalizing teasers about\
  \ <i>Ultimate Campaign</i> to tide you over while it's printing.</p> \n   <blockquote>\
  \ \n    <p><b>10. Do Over!</b> Ready for something different? Wish you hadn't taken\
  \ that one suboptimal feat at first level? Eager to test out the newest base class?\
  \ The choices you made yesterday don't have to sour the game you're playing today\
  \ now that you have complete rules allowing characters to retrain class features,\
  \ whether they be feats and skill ranks or entire class levels!</p> \n    <p><b>9.\
  \ There's a Table for That.</b> How many siblings does your dwarf character have?\
  \ What were your parents' professions? What has your alchemist character been up\
  \ to before you started playing him? What is your relationship to your fellow adventurers?\
  \ You'll know, because with the background generator, there are tables for all that\
  \ and much, much, much more.</p> \n    <p><b>8. Build a Legend.</b> The downtime\
  \ system unlocks awesome new challenges for your character to take on between adventures,\
  \ like creating a headquarters for your adventures, starting a tavern, or even building\
  \ a castle. With downtime, use your wealth, influence, and magic to shape your game\
  \ world like never before.</p> \n    <p><b>7. You're the Boss.</b> Downtime isn't\
  \ just about building structures; it's also about building groups. Once you've constructed\
  \ a temple to your own glory, you're going to need sycophants to staff it. Cults,\
  \ mercenary companies, thieves guilds, ships crews, and more are ready and awaiting\
  \ your orders.</p> \n    <p><b>6. Alain Is a Jerk.</b> Sutter and I tackle the fiction\
  \ snippets at the start of each chapter, and this time around you'll love to hate\
  \ our pompous iconic cavalier.</p> \n    <p><b>5. It's Going To Be Good To Be the\
  \ King.</b> Are you the heir to a lost dynasty, seeking to reclaim your throne?\
  \ Of course you are! And now you can turn your quest into a benefit for your character\
  \ with story feats, a new breed of feat that helps drive you toward a character\
  \ objective and that gets even better once you achieve your goal.</p> \n    <p><b>4.\
  \ Play Harry Potter.</b> Or Arya Stark, or Aang the Last Airbender, or whomever\
  \ your favorite young hero might be, with rules for playing young characters.</p>\
  \ \n    <p><b>3. Theater of War.</b> A dramatic system for running massive battles\
  \ gives you a way to quantify your tales of battle. Lead skirmishes between war\
  \ bands, decide the outcome of legendary battles, or even take your nation's knights\
  \ toe to toe against the towering tarrasque!</p> \n    <p><b>2. On Your Honor.</b>\
  \ Honor points allow your valorous knight, your noble samurai, your rogue with a\
  \ criminal code, or any other character with rigid guiding principles to gain benefits\
  \ from their strict lifestyles. Choose a code to live by or create your own!</p>\
  \ \n    <p><b>1. Kneel Before Me!</b> The Kingdom Building rules popularized during\
  \ the Kingmaker Adventure Path have been revised and expanded, allowing you to found\
  \ a dynasty, build cities, and chart the course of your nation in more depth and\
  \ with more control then ever before!</p> \n   </blockquote> \n   <p>Look for more\
