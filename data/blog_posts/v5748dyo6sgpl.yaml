  \ to become the baseline assumption of the Pathfinder setting between first and\
  \ second editions is the Whispering Tyrant's escape from his centuries-old prison\
  \ to once again terrorize the nations of the living. The specifics of how he breaks\
  \ free from Gallowspire and the direct results of that escape play out in the <a\
  \ href=\"/tyrantsgrasp\">Tyrant's Grasp Adventure Path</a>, which wraps up next\
  \ month with <em>Midwives to Death</em>. Needless to say, things for the lands on\
  \ Lake Encarthan's western coast are NOT. GOOD.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ we've hinted at with the name of the most recent set of Pathfinder Battles miniatures,\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles/ruinsoflastwall\"><em>Ruins of Lastwall</em></a>\
  \ (available now!), the Knights of Ozem who stood vigil over Gallowspire since the\
  \ Shining Crusade met an unfortunate end, and are now scattered throughout the Inner\
  \ Sea region, licking their wounds and trying to muster support for taking the battle\
  \ back to the Isle of Terror, where Tar-Baphon has made his new headquarters. For\
  \ more information on what became of Lastwall, check out the Tyrant's Grasp Adventure\
  \ Path. Without giving too many spoilers of the whys and hows, I'll just say that\
  \ what was formerly Lastwall is now the undead-haunted realm known as the Gravelands.\
  \ Things sound totally awesome there, right?</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \    </div> \n     <p>To the south, the conflict between the nations of Molthune\
  \ and Nirmathas has cooled considerably, thanks to the events of the Ironfang Invasion\
  \ Adventure Path and the advent of a larger threat in the region. Despite the ceasefire\
  \ between the warring nations, tensions remain high, and agents of the Whispering\
  \ Way would certainly love to see the people of both nations return to fighting\
  \ one another rather than directing their military efforts toward the armies of\
  \ the undead.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderLostOmens/20190611-DeadlyRivalry.jpg\"\

  ></a> \n      <p>Illustration by Ksenia Kozhevnikova</p>\n     </div> \n     <p>The\
  \ other notable result of the Ironfang Invasion Adventure Path was the establishment\
  \ of a new hobgoblin nation in the Mindspin Mountains. General Azaersi rules Oprak\
  \ from the newly founded capital of Hunthul, but the mountains of Golarion's surface\
  \ aren't the full extent of the fledgling nation's territory. Thanks to a powerful\
  \ artifact giving the hobgoblins access to the natural resources of the Plane of\
  \ Earth, the kingdom also stretches into the elemental planes. Azaersi's expansionist\
  \ tendencies have been redirected toward mercantile growth, and if she gets her\
  \ way, Oprak could soon become more of an economic threat to its neighbors than\
  \ it is a military threat.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderLostOmens/20160611-VaultOfTheOnyxCitadel.jpg\"\

  \ \n     <p>With the fall of Lastwall and the rise of the Whispering Tyrant's third\
  \ period of rule, the orcs of Belkzen have broken from tradition and refused to\
  \ rally to the lich's side. That places them in the unfortunate role of being among\
  \ the first bulwarks against the undead's expansion beyond the Gravelands and will\
  \ try the governing abilities of the region's new ruler, Overlord Ardax the White-Hair.\
  \ I'm sure a nation of disparate orc tribes will do fine in uniting to quell the\
  \ burgeoning threat to their south and east. What could go wrong?</p> \n     <p>Players\
  \ whose characters hail from this region will find eight new backgrounds including\
  \ cursed family, onyx trader, and Whispering Way scion, as well as the Lastwall\
  \ sentry archetype!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderLostOmens/20190611-Unyielding.jpg\"\
