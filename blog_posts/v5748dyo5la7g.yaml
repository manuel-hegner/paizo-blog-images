  \ April 26, 2007</p> \n   <p>When we decided to set both <i>Pathfinder</i> and the\
  \ GameMastery modules in the same unique campaign world, one of the first issues\
  \ we as a staff had to tackle was the pantheon. As <i>Pathfinder</i> Editor-in-Chief\
  \ James Jacobs regularly points out, without compelling deities, the game is much\
  \ less funâ€”and not just for clerics. Before you can know anything about a person\
  \ or culture, you have to know who's pulling the strings (or who they think is pulling\
  \ them, anyway). Judging by the response to our <a href=\"/paizo/messageboards/pathfinder/general/pollWhatPartOfPathfinderDoYouWantToKnowMoreAbout\"\
  >\"What do you want to know about Pathfinder?\"</a> thread on the messageboards,\
  \ most of you feel the same way.</p> \n   <p>Since gods are so central to a campaign\
  \ setting, everyone on the design staff (and a fair number of people who technically\
  \ aren't) had an opinion. Many were the long Friday afternoon meetings spent hotly\
  \ debating whether the goddess of love is necessarily good, or whether she should\
  \ be given the Trickery domain. Whether the gods created the people, or the people,\
  \ through their belief, created the gods. Whether druids needed a god, and if so,\
  \ whether or not clerics could worship it. How to make a home-and-harvest god cool\
  \ enough that people would actually want to play a cleric of one. In the end, however,\
  \ the chaff was blown away, and our exhausted team found itself staring at a list\
  \ of twenty core gods, with the provision that the door would be left open for numerous\
  \ lesser deities as things evolved. And while most of the names and many of the\
  \ concepts were admittedly swiped wholesale from the exhaustively documented (we're\
  \ talking <i>hundreds</i> of pages) pantheon of Jacobs' homebrew game world, the\
  \ resulting list bears each of our marks.</p> \n   <p>While the full pantheon will\
  \ be presented in detail in the <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7xpx\"><i>Rise of the\
  \ Runelords Player's Guide</i></a>, which will be available for purchase and free\
  \ online download this summer, we wanted to preview part of it here on our blog\
  \ first. Presented below is a brief snippet on the six gods worshipped most frequently\
  \ in Sandpoint, the location of the first Rise of the Runelords adventure.</p> \n\

  \ Old Deadeye</b> <br>LG god of farming, hunting, trade, and family <br><i>Domains:</i>\
  \ Animal, Good, Law, Plant <br><i>Favored Weapon:</i> longbow</p> \n   <p><b>Sarenrae,\
  \ the Dawnflower</b> <br>NG goddess of the sun, redemption, honesty, and healing\
  \ <br><i>Domains:</i> Fire, Good, Healing, Sun <br><i>Favored Weapon:</i> scimitar</p>\
  \ \n   <p><b>Shelyn, the Eternal Rose</b> <br>NG goddess of beauty, art, love, and\
  \ music <br><i>Domains: </i>Air, Good, Luck, Protection <br><i>Favored Weapon: </i>glaive</p>\
  \ \n   <p><b>Desna, Song of the Spheres</b> <br>CG goddess of dreams, stars, travelers,\
  \ and luck <br><i>Domains: </i>Chaos, Good, Luck, Travel <br><i>Favored Weapon:</i>\
  \ starknife</p> \n   <p><b>Abadar, Master of the First Vault</b> <br>LN god of cities,\

  \ <br>N god of nature, weather, and the sea <br><i>Domains: </i>Air, Animal, Plant,\
  \ Water <br><i>Favored Weapon: </i>trident</p> \n   <p>Of course, any good pantheon\
  \ requires far more than a list of domains, and each one of these deities has his,\
  \ her, or its own quirks and backstory that will be explored in lavish detail in\
  \ <i>Pathfinder</i>'s supplementary material... but more on that later. Stay tuned\
  \ for further god-related updates in the coming weeks, and as always, we'd love\
  \ to hear your questions and comments on our messageboards.</p> \n   <p>James Sutter\
