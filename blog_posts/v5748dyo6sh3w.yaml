  \ \n     <h2>Achievement Points – Pathfinder Society (second edition)</h2> \n  \
  \   <p itemprop=\"description\">The last week saw great progress on the backlog\
  \ of organized play tasks. I’ve reviewed resumes for the new Organized Play Associate\
  \ position, posted a blog with Pathfinder Society (second edition) sanctioning,\
  \ and made progress on onboarding our venture-officer volunteers from the Organized\
  \ Play Foundation. There are other tasks, that we aren’t quite ready to reveal,\
  \ that got crossed off the to-do list. While not over the hill, we made progress\
  \ up the slope.</p> \n     <p>One of the outstanding tasks I’m working on is the\
  \ Achievement Point (AcP) system. We found a few small bugs – GM credit and GM AcP\
  \ credit are currently linked – and need a few improvements – scaling the amount\
  \ to accommodate points earned for quests – before we can roll the system out. We\
  \ are testing the system and moving the bar forward but are still a few weeks out\
  \ from implementation.</p> \n     <p>To bridge the gap and allow players to determine\
  \ how to spend their points once the system goes live, we decided to release the\
  \ first round of rewards. We haven’t decided how often to change things, but plan\
  \ on leaving this in place for a minimum of three months, to give players time to\
  \ reach their goals. When we do decide to rotate the offerings, we will announce\
  \ our intentions and give a good amount of time for players to acquire points and\
  \ purchase. This gap will most likely be a month long, but we will watch feedback\
  \ once the system goes live and make final decisions then. As with our other programs,\
  \ the first rotation or two will be where we work the bugs out and fine tune the\
  \ processes.</p> \n     <h3>Achievement Point Chart #1: </h3> \n     <table> \n\

  \ January, we had the pleasure of recognizing longtime venture-officer <b>Jason\
  \ Avery</b>, VC New Hampshire, as recipient. He may now use <b>#827</b>! Huzzah\
  \ and thank you for your efforts on behalf of the gaming community. </p> \n    \
  \ <h2>Novas</h2> \n     <p>Congratulations to our first Nova recipients:</p> \n\
  \     <ul> \n      <li>Gary Norton</li> \n      <li>Natalie Kertzner</li> \n   \
  \   <li>Glen Parnell</li> \n     </ul> \n     <p>As with stars, 5-nova GMs run 150\
  \ games, of which 50 are unique scenarios and 10 are interactive events. They also\
  \ run at least three evaluation games under the purview of a Venture-Captain, who\
  \ evaluate the GM using <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/453xdj9oi6ol7ya/5_%20Rubric-publisheddraft.xlsx?dl=0\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">this rubric</a>. Not a small time committment! Congratulations\
  \ again to our first ever 5-nova GMs.</p> \n     <p>Keep those assessments coming!\
  \ Venture-Captains, to log evaluation games, please use <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfQH9FbQtZ1afA5-IqgDG4v-QD262rk_oqKjv9eSsJZnGIGaw/viewform\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">this form</a> to submit evaluations.</p> \n     <h2>Stars</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>We had one GM reached their 5th star in January. Doing so indicates\
  \ a commitment to organized play, as to achieve this milestone, GMs must run 150\
  \ games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios,\
  \ as well as run a game for a venture-captain. A conservative estimate of time needed\
  \ to reach 5-stars is 650 hours! </p> \n     <p>Congratulations to <b>Aerine Caerwyn</b>\
  \ on achieving her 5th star!</p> \n     <h2>Glyphs</h2> \n     <p>I mentioned it\
  \ under the Achievement Point entry but wanted to note it here as well. We are having\
  \ issues with the separation of GM Achievement Points and GM table credit. Until\
  \ we get this issue resolved, counts aren’t accurate. Once we do get it fixed, we\
  \ will get the symbol in place and people can start announcing their Glyphs.</p>\
  \ \n     <h2>Convention Listing</h2> \n     <p>Convention season 2020 is well under\
  \ way! You can play in Society games at any of the conventions listed below! The\
  \ list includes all submissions as of 4 February. If you see one missing, ping the\
  \ organizer and have them submit a request for support or have them email me at\
  \ organizedplay@paizo.com to discuss their event. All of the conventions on the\
  \ list maintain some type of web presence, be it website, social media page, or\
  \ Warhorn listing, so if you are interested in attending in either capacity, check\
  \ out their websites or contact the local venture-officer for more information!\
