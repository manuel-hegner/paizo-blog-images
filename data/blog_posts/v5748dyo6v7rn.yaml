  \ a bagel outside my window. I smell it in my coffee from down the street (not the\
  \ coffee from up the street—the coffee from the other street, or the coffee from\
  \ the corner; this is Seattle, after all). For the oracle, coming in <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/products/btq02ej5?Pathfinder-Player-Core-2\"><em>Pathfinder Player\
  \ Core 2</em></a>, is Remastered.</p>\n      <p>Oracles are divine spellcasters\
  \ who draw their power not from prayer or devotion to a deity, but from a firsthand\
  \ connection to the great mysteries of the universe. This connection is a double-edged\
  \ sword, though, as gazing too deeply into these mysteries results in terrible backlash\
  \ in the form of a divine curse. While this unique relationship with the divine\
  \ and its “power at a price” theme offer strong and appealing roleplaying hooks\
  \ that are very Golarion (what <em>is</em> the role of an oracle in a world where\
  \ prophecy is lost?), the original oracle was often thought of as intimidatingly\
  \ complex or as a class that made the player jump through hoops to unlock its potential.\
  \ The Remastered oracle has been changed in ways both large and small to reduce\
  \ its complexity and pain points, while still allowing players who want to risk\
  \ fate to draw upon their curse to gain power.</p>\n      <p>The big change: instead\
  \ of an oracle’s curse giving them a large suite of abilities, some of which are\
  \ buffs, some of which are debuffs, and some of which might go either way, the oracle’\
  s curse now just strictly debuffs the player. We’ve done it—no, no, no, come back;\
  \ I promise this made the class stronger!</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \  <p>Because the classic oracle’s curses boosted some stats while lowering others,\
  \ it could be unclear whether being cursed was a benefit you were trying to get\
  \ ASAP or a price you had to strategically work around. In the Remaster, they’re\
  \ always a price, which lets us significantly dial up the power that you get for\
  \ paying it and keeps the trade-off simple to understand: “Cheat the rules of creation\
  \ for power, and you get cursed.” The new oracle’s <b>cursebound trait</b> appears\
  \ not on their focus spells, but instead on specific feats and other actions that\
  \ have a notable advantage over similarly leveled feats, like cheating the action\
  \ economy, letting you automatically learn about your target without a skill check,\
  \ or other similar benefits. Each mystery grants a cursebound ability at level 1\
  \ to let them draw on this power, like Foretell Harm.</p>\n      <h3><b>Foretell\
  \ Harm [free-action] — Feat 1</b></h3>\n      <p><b>Cursebound, Divine, Oracle</b><br><b>Frequency</b>\
  \ Once per round<br><b>Requirements</b> Your previous action was to Cast a non-cantrip\
  \ Spell that dealt damage.</p>\n      <p>Your magic echoes ominously as you glimpse\
  \ injury in the target’s future. At the beginning of your target’s next turn, it\
  \ takes damage equal to twice the triggering spell’s rank as a seemingly random\
  \ and minor misfortune finds it. The damage and type of misfortune is of a type\
  \ matching the spell; for instance, if you dealt fire damage, a flame might spontaneously\
  \ ignite on them or they might burn a hand on their torch. The target is then temporarily\
  \ immune to Foretell Harm for 24 hours.</p>\n      <p>However, whenever you use\
  \ a cursebound ability, your <b>cursebound condition</b> increases in value. This\
  \ is a unique condition that appears only in the oracle class. As your cursebound\
  \ condition increases, the deleterious effects of your curse increase as well, like\
  \ giving you a penalty to certain saving throws or a weakness to certain damage\
  \ types. Like the classic oracle, the remastered oracle can tolerate higher and\
  \ higher cursebound values as they increase in level, letting them use more cursebound\
  \ abilities.</p>\n      <p>While most of these curse effects are relatively simple,\
  \ we do know that a lot of oracle players enjoyed the more disruptive curse effects\
  \ that could really throw variety into your battle. We’ve kept many of these as\
  \ cursebound feats, like Meddling Futures (where sprits vie for control over your\
  \ body) or Thousand Visions (where visions of the future grant you great perception\
  \ within a short range, but overwhelm your senses beyond it), which are now selectable\
  \ by any mystery. Now, oracle players who want to opt into this complexity can do\
  \ so, and oracles who want more straightforward benefits can keep it simple.</p>\n\
  \      <br>\n      <h3>Other Changes</h3>\n      <p>We’ve also made several smaller\
  \ changes throughout the oracle! In no particular order:</p>\n      <ul>\n     \
  \  <li>We’ve made it easier to tailor your oracle's spell list to your mystery.\
  \ Each mystery now grants three thematic spells to an oracle’s repertoire, and all\
  \ oracles automatically gain a divine access class feature about halfway through\
  \ their career that lets them expand this list further.</li>\n       <li>We’ve doubled\
  \ the number of available domains for oracles who want to harness domain magic.\
  \ All mysteries now grant four related domains—now your battle oracle might gain\
  \ the destruction domain, or your cosmos oracle the star domain!</li>\n       <li>We’\
  ve added dashes of ominous, portentous, delirious flavor throughout the class to\
  \ really make you feel like you’re channeling otherworldly powers.</li>\n      \
  \ <li>With more streamlined mysteries and curses, we had room to add a greater number\
  \ of unique oracle feats, a thing that was often cited as lacking in the classic\
  \ oracle. Take a look at a unique feat for ancestors or battle oracles: The Dead\
  \ Walk!</li>\n      </ul>\n      <br>\n      <h3><b>The Dead Walk [two-actions]\
  \ — Feat 10</b></h3>\n      <p><b>Cursebound, Divine, Oracle</b><br><b>Prerequisites</b>\
  \ ancestors or battle mystery</p>\n      <p>You beseech warrior spirits to come\
  \ forth and aid you. Two ghostly warriors manifest within a 30-foot emanation of\
  \ you and each attempt a Strike against an adjacent enemy, using your spell attack\
  \ modifier, and then disappear. The warriors’ Strikes each deal 4d6 spirit damage,\
  \ and the warriors can flank with one another and with you and your allies. If you\
  \ are cursebound 2 when you use The Dead Walk, you instead summon three warriors,\
  \ and if you are cursebound 3, you instead summon four warriors. The warriors disappear\
  \ at the start of your next turn.</p>\n      <p>We’re getting close to the release\
  \ of <em>Player Core 2</em>, with ancestries, archetypes, and more, so be sure to\
  \ subscribe to the Rulebook line, pre-order the book, or make a note to swing by\
  \ our booth at Gen Con to check things out—and keep an eye on the future for the\
  \ last of our Remaster class previews!</p>\n      <p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\
