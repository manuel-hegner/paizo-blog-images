  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Raia crouched behind a stack\
  \ of crates, camouflage membrane turned to full power, focused on powering up the\
  \ warehouse’s maintenance terminal. Once her enchantments opened up the interface,\
  \ she plugged the jack into her custom wrist mount and said into her comm, “I’m\
  \ in.” </p> \n     <p>“You know,” answered Navasi. “I’ve never heard anyone say\
  \ that on a job. Outside of an action holovid, anyway.”</p> \n     <p>“Those soap\
  \ writers wish they wrote plots as good as my life,” Raia answered. “About to go\
  \ virtual. Stay put until you get my beacon. After I trip security, I’m going to\
  \ need a fast exit.”</p> \n     <p>“‘After’ you trip security?” said Navasi. “Don’\
  t you mean ‘if’? Say you mean ‘if,’ Raia.”</p> \n     <p>Raia laughed and said,\
  \ “Going virtual.” </p> \n     <p>The world around her vanished. Raia could still\
  \ see, hear, and even feel and taste, but in this glowing, in-between world, meant\
  \ to represent the digital flow of the local infosphere, sensation was different.\
  \ Here, she was different. And much more powerful. </p> \n     <p>Raia had been\
  \ hired by a politician to expose a cult. She’d taken the job, not for money, but\
  \ for a favor. Months ago, Starfinder Society probes had discovered yet another\
  \ inhabited planet along the edges of Near Space, which ancient star charts named\
  \ Sigerro. Preliminary scans indicated Sigerro’s inhabitants possessed a rich culture\
  \ and advanced technology. Many interested parties hoped to be on the first diplomatic\
  \ team sent to meet their people, but such assignments would be determined by the\
  \ Directorate in accordance with Pact World protocol. </p> \n     <p>Luckily, Elxur\
  \ Droj, the verthani politician in charge of the Directorate’s diplomatic corp,\
  \ was also a Seeker in his spare time—one of a group of infosphere conspiracists\
  \ hoping to expose the wide-spread religion called the Disciples of Grace. Instead\
  \ of helping the poor and sick, Seekers believed the Disciples were secretly corrupt\
  \ slavers bent on taking over the Pact Worlds. Elxur not only believed this, he\
  \ hoped to use their exposure to run for higher political office.</p> \n     <p>After\
  \ approaching Elxur through her usual aliases, Raia had managed to secure a deal.\
  \ If she could procure evidence of corrupt Disciple activity, Elxur would approve\
  \ her request to be part of the diplomatic team on Sigerro.</p> \n     <p>The Disciples\
  \ of Grace certainly weren’t spending all their credits on charity, no matter how\
  \ well they laundered their donations. Raia had been able to locate a warehouse\
  \ on Verces used by one of their shell companies for off-the-books shipments. If\
  \ she could acquire shipping manifests, Elxur should grant her a place on the diplomatic\
  \ mission.</p> \n     <p>Now, Raia stood on a floating platform in seemingly endless\
  \ digital chasm. Once she leapt, there was no turning back. Checking to make all\
  \ her defenses and countermeasures were in place, she dove into digital void.</p>\

  all\"> \n     <br> \n     <p>It was like freefall, glorious freefall, except instead\
  \ of wind, breezes of bytes and floods of information cascaded all around her.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>As long as Raia kept falling, standard security measures shouldn’t be\
  \ able to track her presence, so fast was she moving from one node to the next.\
  \ Yet this also made acquiring the right data hard.</p> \n     <p>Everywhere she\
  \ looked, she saw secure files as floating screens—and each image they depicted\
  \ was disturbing. People being led away in chains. Priests changing form in private.\
  \ These weren’t shipping manifests, but they might be better. Like a hungry child\
  \ in an orchard, Raia plucked as many files as she could into her avatar for later\
  \ study. She didn’t have much time before the system’s internal security caught\
  \ on to her falling simulation and—</p> \n     <p><em>VHHT VHHHT VHHHHHT</em></p>\
  \ \n     <p>Suddenly, instead of descending down an endless void, Raia was approaching\
  \ hard ground fast. A digital wall of spiky security code had manifested—which could\
  \ shatter Raia’s persona on impact. They’d detected her more quickly than anticipated.\
  \ Upgraded security. Definitely more cutting edge than a charitable religion should\
  \ have access to. </p> \n     <p>Instead of smashing into the wall of code, Raia\
  \ activated another program, buffering her processors through the node, her digital\
  \ persona appearing to float gently to the ground. </p> \n     <p>Where she was\
  \ instantly surrounded by glowing-red virtual security countermeasures. Vicious,\
  \ cutting-edge anti-hacker programs, which in the virtual resembled crimson piranhas\
  \ coated in blood-red razor wire, swirling in on themselves. </p> \n     <p>“Aren’\
  t you just the cutest things,” she muttered. They rushed at her, but Raia had come\
  \ ready for something like this.</p> \n     <p>With the grace of an acrobat, she\
  \ dodged their serrated tentacles—prodding counterhacks trying to penetrate her\
  \ avatar and learn her identity. Just when it seemed the countermeasures might be\
  \ too numerous to evade, Raia pulled her next trick. In a flash of green, two digital\
  \ versions of Raia stood surrounded by the menacing security programs. Both fled\
  \ in different directions. The security countermeasures, momentarily confused, split\
  \ up to chase both.</p> \n     <p>While her decoy fled, Raia dove behind a digital\
  \ gleaming column and amped up her camouflage code, similar to the weave she’d been\
  \ using in the real world. She blended completely into the digital wall around her.\
  \ As the last security countermeasure flew past, Raia pounced, landing atop it,\
  \ clawing both hands inside its glowing carapace.</p> \n     <p>With the precision\
  \ of a surgeon, she copied its access privileges and modified its instructions.\
  \ Once finished, the drone glowed the same green as her persona’s glowing functions.\
  \ It sped off to fight its former companions, while Raia used its security clearance\
  \ to copy the shipping manifests she’d originally been hoping to “borrow.” </p>\
  \ \n     <p>A crackle and a beep indicated a message coming over her comm in the\
  \ real world. “Raia? Things are getting pretty hot. Alarms everywhere and bots are\
  \ summoning private security teams to your location.”</p> \n     <p>Time to rabbit.\
  \ Raia exited the hacking sequence, copied data securely stored in her rig. She\
  \ turned on her beacon and sprinted toward the street, already spotting Navasi’\
  s hovercar blasting around the corner. </p> \n     <p>As she prepared to leap onto\
  \ the vehicle, Raia wondered what she’d been able to acquire. She didn’t know exactly\
  \ what was on those files, but it should be enough to get her on the diplomatic\
  \ team. Either way, she’d make sure never to donate to Disciples of Grace in the\
  \ future.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p style=\"font-weight: bold; line-height:\
