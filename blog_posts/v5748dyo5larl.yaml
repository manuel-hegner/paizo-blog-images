  \   <p>As the new <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures\">Reaper Pathfinder\
  \ minis</a> roll into (and just as quickly out of) the warehouse, it makes me appreciate\
  \ how crafty Paizo fans can be. With all the miniatures, sets, props, and stage\
  \ plays we've seen kitbashed together around here, it's easy for even the unstoppable\
  \ Paizo warband to feel humbled. And of all these projects, miniatures occupy a\
  \ special place in most gamers' hearts. Something about having that 25mm scale representation\
  \ of your character touches a special, squishy place in every geek's heart. My own\
  \ collection of painted minis rivals even that of Czarina Catherine the Great (little\
  \ known fact: Cat was gonzo for 1st Edition, and ran a game of Traveller every other\
  \ Thursday), but EPA lead regulations and simple goblin humility prevent me from\
  \ sharing them here.</p> \n    <p>To get you geared up for your brand new Pathfinder\
  \ Reaper minis, here's a quick collection of links to help teach and inspire every\
  \ crafty Paizo fan. </p> \n    <p>In the last few weeks, the <a href=\" /paizo/messageboards/community/gaming/gamerLife/paintingMiniatures&amp;page=1\"\
  >Paizo messageboards</a> have been buzzing with painting tips, tricks, and (most\
  \ of all), examples. With active discussions and a welcoming group familiar with\
  \ the Pathfinder line, this is your best place to get started and learn from a friendly\
  \ group you might already know. Even the official Paizo Paintmeister, Sean K Reynolds\
  \ contributes to the discussions and offers insider tips. If you don't need to pick\
  \ up the basics, it never hurts to hobnob with fellow Paizonians, show off your\
  \ work, bask in the admiration of the faceless masses, and know for just a brief\
  \ moment how it feels to be a world-famous goblin blogger and production specialist.\
  \ Also it facilitates that sense of community that makes Paizo fans the best of\
  \ the best.</p> \n    <p>If you love the idea of having a tiny metal avatar of yourself,\
  \ but don't know where to start, then one of the best places to learn is the <a\
  \ href=\"http://minipainting-guild.net/\" target=\"nofollow\">Miniature Painting\
  \ Guild</a>. They feature several handy tutorials for all skills levels, as well\
  \ as forums and a large gallery. My personal favorite: a catalog of \"restored\"\
  \ miniatures, rescued from terrible paint jobs by the Guild's loyal members. And\
  \ if you're simply one of the Paizonians with more time than money, the Miniature\
  \ Painting Guild also offers professional paintings services on commission.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Once you're comfortable with the basics, <a href=\"http://www.reapermini.com/\"\
  \ target=\"nofollow\"> Reaper Miniatures</a> offers some of the best figures in\
  \ the industry, covering hundreds of niches and character archetypes. Searching\
  \ the Reaper catalog the old-fashioned way, while exciting, can take weeks, so be\
  \ sure to try out their Figure Finder to pick out exactly the right miniature for\
  \ your character needs. Or just browse through their Inspirational Gallery for ideas\
  \ to customize your own painting work. Once you know what models you want, you can\
  \ order most any of them here in the <a href=\"/store/byCompany/r/reaperMiniatures\"\
  >Paizo storefront</a> and combine them with the latest Pathfinder supplements and\
  \ GameMastery items you'll doubtless be using with them.</p> \n    <p>Of course,\
  \ old-fashioned pewter miniatures are only the beginning: everything from repurposed\
  \ game tokens and children's toys to your favorite illustrations can be turned into\
  \ prime gaming minis with a little creativity and know-how. I've seen a man run\
  \ a game with nothing but miniatures molded by his own, gnarled hands from Sculpy,\
  \ and my great-grandmother ran tactical table wargames with an entire Napoleonic\
  \ regiment made from the piled entrails of her fallen enemies. The smell was horrendous,\
  \ but it gave her a certain psychological edge. As gamers, we share a lot of creative\
  \ outlets, but few that are so easily appreciated and constantly in play as our\
  \ minis. For some of us, minis were even that neat little gimmick that first got\
  \ us into gaming. So lay your hands on some lead and show off your skills in the\
  \ forums, and let us revel in this common facet of gaming culture. As the immortal\
  \ Steve Martin put it: Let's get small.</p> \n    <p>Crystal Frasier <br>Production\
