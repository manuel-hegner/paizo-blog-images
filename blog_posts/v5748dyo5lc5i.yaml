  \ border=\"0\" align=\"right\" hspace=\"9\"></a> \n    <p>For many months now, a\
  \ good portion of the staff here at Paizo has been slaving away in secret, working\
  \ on a project that has only been mentioned in hushed tones and vague inferences.\
  \ While its existence has become common knowledge, few outside the halls of Paizo\
  \ know much about this rumored product. Well, the time for secrecy is over! Now\
  \ it is time to take our first look at the <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy8kgt\"><i>Pathfinder\
  \ Roleplaying Game Beginner Box</i></a>!</p> \n    <p>Personally, I have wanted\
  \ to do this project since the early days of the Pathfinder RPG. A beginner set\
  \ not unlike this one is what got me into gaming over 20 years ago. While I can't\
  \ go into all the details of this impressive box just yet, it is time to give you\
  \ some of the basic details about what to expect from the <i>Beginner Box</i> and\
  \ what it will contain.</p> \n    <p>First off, this box is designed to contain\
  \ everything that a new gamer needs to begin playing the Pathfinder RPG, from dice\
  \ and pawns to a simplified rules set and an exciting starter adventure. There are\
  \ enough rules in this box to take characters all the way up to 5th level, and plenty\
  \ of tools for the GM to create countless hours of play. But that's not all. Take\
  \ a look at this list of components.</p> \n    <ul>\n     <li>A 64-page <i>Hero's\
  \ Handbook</i>, detailing character creation, spells, equipment, and general rules\
  \ for playing the game</li> \n     <li>A 96-page <i>Game Master's Guide</i> packed\
  \ with adventures, monsters, magical treasures, and advice on how to narrate the\
  \ game and control the challenges faced by the heroes</li> \n     <li>A complete\
  \ set of 7 high-impact polyhedral dice</li> \n     <li>More than 80 full-color pawns\
  \ depicting tons of heroes, monsters, and even a fearsome black dragon</li> \n \
  \    <li>Four pregenerated character sheets to throw you right into the action</li>\
  \ \n     <li>Four blank character sheets to record the statistics and deeds of your\
  \ custom-made hero</li> \n     <li>A durable, reusable, double-sided Flip-Mat play\
  \ surface that works with any kind of marker</li>\n    </ul> \n    <p>Suffice it\
  \ to say, that is a lot to pack into one box. I am going to have a lot more to say\
  \ about this particular product in the coming months (especially during the banquet\
  \ at this year's <a href=\"/paizocon\">PaizoCon</a>). Until then.</p> \n    <p>Jason\
