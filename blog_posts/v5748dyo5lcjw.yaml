  \ Society Recap</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Monday, August 15, 2011</p> \n   <p>It's\
  \ been over a week since Gen Con wrapped up, and a little less than that since we\
  \ returned to business as usual here at Paizo HQ. But even though we're back in\
  \ the swing of deadlines and such, the rush of Pathfinder Society at Gen Con still\
  \ has me feeling high!</p> \n   <p>Over the course of four days and ten slots, we\
  \ seated over 3,000 excited Pathfinders, many of whom played their first Pathfinder\
  \ Society scenario during the convention. And though we sold out almost every event\
  \ months before the show, I'm proud to say that nearly everyone who wanted to get\
  \ into a game with generic tickets was able to do so. We only had to turn people\
  \ away in two of the ten slots!</p> \n   <p>Our Friday night special, <i>Blood Under\
  \ Absalom</i>, was a smashing success, and we were able to get everyone who wanted\
  \ to play a seat, pulling in extra tables from the hall to ensure that no one was\
  \ left out. The result was 51 tables (out of a sold-out 45) of Pathfinders of all\
  \ levels running through the same adventure, GMed by none other than the incomparable\
  \ Tim Hitchcock.</p> \n   <p>In addition to the rewards all players get for surviving\
  \ a Pathfinder Society Scenario, we had additional prizes that players and GMs could\
  \ try to win by unlocking the Pathfinder Society treasure chest. Inside were signed\
  \ copies of hardcover rulebooks, free map packs and flip mats, Pathfinder Tales\
  \ novels, and even exclusive Pathfinder Society boons. Some players walked away\
  \ with Chronicle sheets granting them access to non-core races like aasimar, tiefling,\
  \ tengu, and dhampir, and everyone who played a scenario or delve got a Gen Con\
  \ exclusive boon granting them weapon proficiency with one Eastern weapon from <a\
  \ href=\"/store/v5748btpy8mcz\"><i>Ultimate Combat</i></a>. For those Pathfinder\
  \ Society players and GMs who couldn't make it to the show, we'll be trying similar\
  \ promotions at regional conventions and game stores in the coming months, spearheaded\
  \ by our invaluable Venture-Captains, so keep an eye out for your chance to get\
  \ some exclusive Pathfinder Society Chronicles in your area.</p> \n   <p>Thanks\
  \ to everyone who spent valuable time and money ensuring Gen Con 2011 was the most\
  \ successful Pathfinder Society convention to date. Without all our Venture-Captains,\
  \ HQ volunteers, and over 50 GMs per slot, thousands of gamers would have missed\
  \ out on the launch of the Year of the Ruby Phoenix and hours of fun exploring Golarion!\
  \ Keep an eye on this blog in the coming months for early information about our\
  \ plans of next Gen Con, including how you can volunteer to help make Gen Con 2012\
  \ an even bigger success!</p> \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    <a href=\"/image/content/JadeRegent/PZO9049_Ameiko.jpg\"\
