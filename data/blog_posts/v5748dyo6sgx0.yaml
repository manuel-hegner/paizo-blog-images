  \ \n     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">“There's nothing we can\
  \ do—all systems are jammed! Prepare for emergency landing!”</p> \n      <p>As Captain\
  \ Navasi's frantic voice echoed throughout the <i>Sunrise Maiden</i>'s bridge, a\
  \ sinking feeling settled into the pit of Zemir's stomach.</p> \n      <p>There\
  \ were many realities in which the <i>Maiden</i> was an unreliable starship, but\
  \ this wasn't one of them. Something wasn't right. </p> \n      <p>But that didn't\
  \ change the fact that the ship was quickly plummeting into the atmosphere of an\
  \ uncharted planet in the Vast. If the crew didn't act quickly, that desolate rock\
  \ would be their grave.</p> \n      <p>Pushing aside his fear, Zemir leaned back\
  \ in his chair and cleared his mind. In an instant he sorted through a thousand\
  \ iterations of this crash landing and clung to just one—the one where everyone\
  \ survived.</p> \n      <p>“Hard to starboard!” Zemir boomed. “Aim for that plateau—\
  it's our only shot!”</p> \n      <p>“You heard him!” Navasi shouted, cutting in\
  \ the ship's retro-thrusters to try to slow its descent. “All hands! Starboard side!”\
  </p> \n      <p>Obozaya and Quig scrambled to the captain's terminal, the bulky\
  \ vesk's eyes wide with adrenaline and the scraggly ysoki shrieking profanities.\
  \ They forced their weight onto the controls, pulling the levers far past their\
  \ safety points, desperately hoping the ship could find the landing spot Zemir had\
  \ seemingly pulled from thin air.</p> \n      <p>“That's it,” Zemir encouraged them,\
  \ clinging to the single survival scenario he foresaw. “We're going to make it!”\
  </p> \n      <p>The <i>Maiden</i>'s proximity sensor screamed a warning. The ship\
  \ slammed three times into the hard ground. But sure enough, thanks to the reality\
  \ Zemir had plucked like a grain of sand from an infinite beach, they crashed in\
  \ one piece.</p> \n      <p>Once Navasi caught her breath, the captain stumbled\
  \ over to Zemir and clapped him on the back.</p> \n      <p>“Another day, another\
  \ of your mysterious magic tricks,” she said, grinning with relief. “I don't suppose\
  \ the universe told you <i>why</i> we all just nearly died in a fiery crash, did\
  \ it?”</p> \n      <p>Obozaya strode up behind Navasi, glowering with anger now\
  \ that the danger had passed. “If there is an enemy here, Zemir, tell us. It is\
  \ dishonorable to sabotage the ship,” she growled.</p> \n      <p>Zemir forced a\
  \ characteristic chuckle and shook his head. His companions knew his powers didn't\
  \ work that way.</p> \n      <p>“Look, I don't have all the answers,” Zemir said.\
  \ He grinned impishly. “Where we are, and why we're here—well, I'll need some help\
  \ figuring that out.”</p> \n      <p>Just then, a telltale pinging rang out from\
  \ the <i>Maiden</i>'s comms. Quig slid over to examine the readout.</p> \n     \
  \ <p>“Hey,” the gruff ysoki barked. “While you three are over there solvin' the\
  \ world's mysteries, somebody near us on this rock needs help. Distress signal incoming.”\
  </p> \n      <p>Hesitating, Navasi turned toward Quig. “But the ship—how damaged\
  \ are we?”</p> \n      <p>“Structural damage minimal. I'll reset our systems and\
  \ we'll be peachy again in an hour. Seems we just hit an electronics-jamming field.”\
  </p> \n      <p>Obozaya hefted her doshko and looked at the captain, who nodded.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>“If someone else hit that field and <i>didn't</i> have someone with\
  \ Zemir's talents aboard, it's possible there's another crew outside lying on death's\
  \ door,” Navasi said. “Obo, Quig—you up for a search and rescue? Zemir and I'll\
  \ watch the systems.”</p> \n      <p>The vesk and ysoki nodded, saluted their captain,\
  \ and headed toward the ship's airlock. </p> \n      <p>Zemir's eyes narrowed. Again,\
  \ the subtlest of ripples tickled his senses. Something was <i>not</i> right, but\
  \ without any sense of what or why, Zemir did the only thing he could.</p> \n  \
  \    <p>“I'll join the rescue,” he said, winking to Navasi and striding purposefully\
  \ to catch up with his companions. “You saw that green sky? Seems like a view I\
  \ can't miss.”</p> \n      <p>The captain nodded, and the three set off for the\
  \ source of the distress signal. Despite the rocky planet's abandoned desolation,\
  \ its atmosphere was surprisingly friendly. Helmets off, the crew sauntered past\
  \ chalky rock formations, skirting steep valleys and stagnant pools of dark liquid.\
  \ Knowing Zemir's love of culture and cuisine, Quig joked about making the witchwarper\
  \ a “sludge soufflé,” while Obozaya missed the jest and offered to share traditional\
  \ vesk baking recipes.</p> \n      <p>It was strangely like any other friendly stroll—\
  until the twinge in the back of Zemir's mind became a nauseating wave. Gritting\
  \ his teeth through the mental assault, Zemir saw dozens of beady eyes and vicious\
  \ tusks beginning to rise from crevices in the surrounding rock.</p> \n      <p>The\
  \ creatures' hulking, scaled forms and snake-like tongues were unmistakable.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>“Riveners!” Zemir shouted. “It's an ambush!”</p> \n      <p>The tines\
  \ of her doshko roaring to life, Obozaya gave a fearsome battle cry and lunged toward\
  \ the nearest riveners—powerful and nearly mindlessly aggressive lizard-like monsters\
  \ often used as shock troops. Not to be outdone, Quig snatched his flamethrower\
  \ from his back and braced himself to unleash a gout of flaming petrol.</p> \n \
  \     <p>But Zemir stood back, the wisdom of infinite possibilities settling on\
  \ his shoulders. </p> \n      <p>The odds, he noted, were not in the companions'\
  \ favor. Zemir counted a dozen riveners rushing toward him and his friends, who\
  \ were already beginning to falter. And Zemir was certain he saw a different humanoid\
  \ form scuttle away from the battlefield. </p> \n      <p>The twinges he felt made\
  \ sense now. There was another witchwarper at hand—that's why everything from the\
  \ moment the <i>Maiden</i>'s systems jammed until now felt like it existed in the\
  \ reality next door. Someone was out to destroy Zemir and his friends, and it seemed\
  \ they were willing to change existence itself to do it.</p> \n      <p>Not if Zemir\
  \ could help it, he thought, as he scrambled atop a rock formation high above the\
  \ fray. </p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/101019_Zemir.jpg\"\

  \ \n      <p>Gritting his teeth and stretching out his arms, Zemir focused his mind\
  \ and began to call just a taste of a terrible world into their own. Hellfire rained\
  \ down from the sky, the ground boiled into lava, and grasping hands sprang from\
  \ the rocky earth to clutch at the slavering riveners' feet.</p> \n      <p>Of course,\
  \ much of it was an illusion. Zemir's friends knew that; they had witnessed his\
  \ raw power unleashed before. Still, Obozaya and Quig turned to stare at Zemir in\
  \ terrified, respectful awe.</p> \n      <p>The riveners, on the other hand, screamed\
  \ with horror as the spectral hands grabbed at them and the hellfire burned through\
  \ their skin and flesh.</p> \n      <p>“Finish them off!” Zemir shouted. He leapt\
  \ off the rock formation to pursue the opposing witchwarper. “Do <i>not</i> follow\
  \ me!”</p> \n      <p>Purple robes billowing behind him, Zemir dashed to the ravine\
  \ where he'd seen the mysterious humanoid figure disappear. But when he vaulted\
  \ down, a different sight stole his breath.</p> \n      <p>Instead of a person,\
  \ there was merely a metal hatch set into the ground. It was partially ajar, revealing\
  \ a passage that led deep below. And on the hatch was a familiar crest: a stylized\
  \ “IEM.”</p> \n      <p>The crest of the Institute for Extraordinary Minds.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>An academy for witchwarpers. </p> \n      <p>Specifically, Zemir's\
  \ alma mater—and one whose masters held a fierce vendetta against the fugitive who\
  \ abandoned three of his classmates in an alternate reality many years ago.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Reflexively, Zemir lifted his comm unit to his mouth to warn Navasi\
  \ back on the <i>Maiden</i>. His past had come to call, and now they were all in\
  \ danger.</p> \n      <p>“Captain, they've found me,” he said.</p> \n      <p>No\
  \ response.</p> \n      <p>“Captain?”</p> \n      <p>A scream, and then nothing\
  \ but static.</p> \n      <div style=\"border: 1px solid rgb(49,0,0); background:rgb(230,225,219);\
