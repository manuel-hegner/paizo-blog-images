  \ rushs into Ambrus’ office, excitedly waving a parchment in the air. Her hurried\
  \ entrance caused enough of a disturbance to rustle the papers lying on his desk.\
  \ He glances up from the paper in hand, a look of irritation briefly passing over\
  \ his features. </p> \n       <p>Laying the parchment onto the stack before him,\
  \ Ambrus took a deep breath. “What is it this time, Janira?” he asks, trying to\
  \ keep the exasperation from his voice. </p> \n       <p>“Great news from Pathfinders\
  \ to the east! They’re holding a version of our Convocation in their area. With\
  \ a pool! And beer! And people! Now I just need to convince the Decemvirate that\
  \ I should attend.” She bounces on the balls of her feet, her uncontainable enthusiasm\
  \ preventing her from standing still.</p> \n       <p>“I’m sure they will say yes.\
  \ Just complete the necessary request paperwork.” He reaches into his right desk\
  \ drawer and draws out a roll of parchment, looks up at the lively halfling, then\
  \ sighs and dips his quill into the inkpot on his desk. “How about I help, since\
  \ you don’t look like settling down to write anytime soon. What are the particulars?”\
  </p> \n       <p>Together, they completed the paperwork. “Thanks for helping!” Janira\
  \ leans over and gives Ambrus a quick hug, then hurries to the door. “You’ll file\
  \ that today, yes? I don’t want to wait too long for an answer!” Before he can reply,\
  \ she opens the door, finding a large group of Pathfinders waiting outside. The\
  \ group parts, allowing her to move into the corridor. Ambrus’ chuckles briefly\
  \ and motions the Pathfinders to enter. A faint “goodbye” drifts back into the room,\
  \ caught on the breeze, as Janira runns to her next encounter.</p> \n      </blockquote>\

  \  <p>We are pleased to announce the launch of PaizoCon Francia under the direction\
  \ of Regional Venture-Coordinator Benoît Gros. In his words, “After 6 consecutive\
  \ years, GardenCon evolves into PaizoCon Francia. Come enjoy the only open-air PaizoCon\
  \ in the beautiful Geneva countryside. Not convinced yet? How about a laidback schedule,\
  \ local craft beer, and tables played in English or French to fulfill your mid-August\
  \ gamers needs! Still not convinced? Did we mention there's also a pool?”</p> \n\
  \      <p>PaizoCon Francia will be held at the Route de la Craz, Thônex, Geneva,\
  \ from <b>August 13th to 16th, 2020</b>. More details will appear as the organizing\
  \ team passes them to us, including registration information.</p> \n      <p><em>Before\
  \ you go</em>…We have a procedural announcement that we will include in our next\
  \ monthly update, but that we wanted to announce to our society GMs and organizers\
  \ before the first week of May.</p> \n      <p>Feedback from our communities regarding\
  \ tables for Pathfinder Society (second edition) indicates that 7-player tables\
  \ aren’t working. So, we are phasing them out. Starting as soon as possible, we\
  \ ask GMs to move to 6-player tables. We are giving a transition period so that\
  \ we don’t cause issues for conventions and events already planned. As of June 1st,\
  \ seven players will not be legal tables. In cases of 7 players, the tables should\
  \ be split into two. This will make a more balanced experience and works better\
  \ within the scaling mechanisms of the program.</p> \n      <p>That’s all for today.\
  \ Come back next week when we preview the April scenarios and quest. Until then,\
  \ may you all stay safe and remember to Explore, Report, Cooperate, Wash Hands!</p>\
