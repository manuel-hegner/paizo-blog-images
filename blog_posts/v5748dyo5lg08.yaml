  \   <p class=\"date\">by Christopher Paul Carey</p> \n   <h2>Chapter Two: Pursuit</h2>\
  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">Nekhtep\
  \ looked down at Jasilia as they stood in the shadow of the great dune, his expression\
  \ puzzled. \"How could you know where they've taken Ojan? And who's 'they'?\"</span></p>\
  \ \n    <p>Even in her distress, Jasilia noted that Nekhtep had broken protocol\
  \ and chosen not to use one of her twin brother's many formal titles.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>She looked off into the east, tracing the trail of frost-laden sand until it\
  \ disappeared among the dunes. \"Have you ever heard of Mekshir?\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Mekshir?\" Nektep beetled his brow. \"An ancient outpost or fortress or something,\
  \ right?\"</p> \n    <p>\"That's the one.\"</p> \n    <p>\"But Mekshir was supposed\
  \ to have been buried by a khamsin thousands of years ago.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Well,\
  \ it looks like it got unburied.\"</p> \n    <p>Jasilia grabbed her brother's khopesh\
  \ from the Risen Guard's hand and set off along the roughly three-foot-wide band\
  \ of frost, ignoring Nekhtep's calls for her to stop.</p> \n    <p>A moment later,\
  \ Nekhtep was beside her. A hand fell on her arm. \"Jasilia.\" </p> \n    <p>She\
  \ turned on him, her anger welling up. \"What, Nekhtep? No 'O Heritor' or 'My Most\
  \ Spectacular Pain-in-the-Ass Princess'? My brother—heir to my <i>other</i> royal\
  \ brother, the all-powerful, know-it-all Ruby Prince—has been taken by undead, and\
  \ <i>now</i> you want to take the time get personal?\"</p> \n    <p>Nekhtep winced,\
  \ and Jasilia immediately regretted her words.</p> \n    <p>\"Look, I'm sorry,\"\
  \ she said, \"it's just—\"</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500_DuneRunner_Jasilia.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500_DuneRunner_Jasilia_360.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n     <br>Jasilia doesn't give up easily.\n    </div> \n   \
  \ <p>Nekhtep threw down his heavy bag of armor and equipment. \"Just tell me about\
  \ Mekshir,\" he said, in that calm and reassuring voice she used to love. \"You\
  \ were about to explain who took him and how you know.\" </p> \n    <p>She took\
  \ a deep breath and exhaled slowly.</p> \n    <p>\"It's the trail.\" She motioned\
  \ to the strip of icy sand beside them. \"Pick up your bag and let's get moving\
  \ before it melts. We can talk on the way.\"</p> \n    <p>Nekhtep did as he was\
  \ bade and they set off, footing their way between the dunes.</p> \n    <p>\"I've\
  \ read about the history of Mekshir in the royal library at Sothis.\" Jasilia panted\
  \ her words as she proceeded at a brisk pace over the sand. \"It was a military\
  \ base guarding what was then a border of the Osirian province of Thuvia. A khamsin\
  \ struck it toward the end of the Apsu Dynasty, and it was never formally heard\
  \ from again.\"</p> \n    <p>\"'Formally'?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Anathepses mentions\
  \ two more accounts of Mekshir in his <i>Desert Empires</i>. The first was in –\
  598 AR—\" She made a mental calculation. \"Two hundred and forty-three years after\
  \ Mekshir was buried, if you want to be exact. Seems a caravan on its way to Eto\
  \ came across a trail of frost on the sand just like this one. They sent off one\
  \ of their scouts to follow it, and when he never came back, they sent off another.\
  \ A few nights later, a band of undead attacked. The caravanners fought them off,\
  \ but in the aftermath they found the two scouts among the fallen enemies, both\
  \ rotting with the stench of the undead they'd become. The other attackers—skeletons\
  \ with putrefying flesh still hanging from their bones—were all wearing military\
  \ regalia, and their shields bore the ancient seal of Mekshir.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  And the other account?\"</p> \n    <p>\"According to Anathepses, it didn't end quite\
  \ so well. Legend says a squad of Xerbystes I's army ran across Mekshir after a\
  \ monstrous khamsin struck western Osirion and unburied it. The commander and his\
  \ soldiers were captured by the fortress's undead sentries and brought before the\
  \ skeletal lord that ruled over the place. The strange thing is, when the ruler\
  \ interrogated the captives, he seemed to have no clue about the Keleshite interregnum.\
  \ Banged his scepter in a blind rage whenever the commander mentioned it.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"You said it ended badly,\" Nekhtep said.</p> \n    <p>Jasilia nodded.\
  \ \"While Xerbystes's soldiers were holding court with the fortress's lord, another\
  \ khamsin swept up out of nowhere and reburied Mekshir, along with the captive Keleshites.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Nekhtep laughed. \"Then how did anyone learn of their story?\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Anathepses doesn't say.\" When Nekhtep gave her a skeptical look, she\
  \ said, \"Look, you know how spotty the details are in these old histories. Presumably\
  \ one of the party escaped.\"</p> \n    <p>The Risen Guard stopped walking and placed\
  \ his hands on his hips, surveying the seemingly endless dune field from the top\
  \ of the rise as sweat beaded down his brown cheeks.</p> \n    <p>\"You're not going\
  \ to like what I'm about to say,\" he said, \"but hear me out. We're not going to\
  \ get far without the camels. We should head west, follow the Junira north until\
  \ we hit the caravan route. Then we can hitch a ride east to Shiman-Sekh and get\
  \ aid from the Risen Guard contingent stationed there to mount a rescue mission.\
  \ If we head out into the deep desert alone and the trail melts before—\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>Jasilia cleared her throat and pointed to Nekhtep's left. The Risen Guard\
  \ turned slowly to be greeted by the bleating of a camel strutting up the side of\
  \ the dune, its reins dragging over the sand. When it reached the top, the great\
  \ dromedary loped past Nekhtep and knelt down on all four legs directly before Jasilia.\
  \ </p> \n    <p>\"There, there, Yamala.\" She rubbed the beast's side. \"I wasn't\
  \ going to leave you behind.\" She leveled an accusatory gaze at Nekhtep. Then,\
  \ taking up the reins, she swung a leg over the low point between the beast's shoulders\
  \ and mounted bareback. \"You coming?\"</p> \n    <p>Nekhtep didn't look happy,\
  \ but finally he spread his hands in surrender and got onto the beast behind Jasilia.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Jasilia felt herself shift back against Nekhtep's muscular form as the\
  \ camel rose to its feet. For a brief moment she allowed herself to be comforted\
  \ by the feel of her ex-lover's embrace. Then, as the camel swung them forward,\
  \ she squirmed and tried to scoot forward out of his encircling arms. He only held\
  \ on to her tighter.</p> \n    <p>\"Don't get any ideas, Risen One,\" she said.\
  \ \"You gave up that option when you decided to die under the Ruby Prince's blade.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"For the record,\" he said, \"I still think this is a bad idea. We've\
  \ only got so much water.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Then you'll die again, but this time\
  \ for a worthy cause: trying to save the life of Osirion's royal heir.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"Or we'll all die and I'll lose you twice.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Hey, you could\
  \ have had me, remember? It didn't mean anything to me that you were a commoner.\
  \ I agreed to flee the country with you, but you wouldn't have it.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  When I swore an oath to the pharaoh that our relationship was over, I had no idea\
  \ he would show his 'compassion' by making me your bodyguard.\" Nekhtep's jaw tensed.\
  \ \"But I don't regret my decision to go under the blade.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Why?\"\
  \ Jasilia's heart pounded.</p> \n    <p>\"There were... other considerations.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Like <i>what</i>?\"</p> \n    <p>The only answer was the throaty\
  \ roar of the camel as she guided it toward the trail of unearthly frost. Jasilia\
  \ urged Yamala into a trot and they made their way east into the sun's ruthless\
  \ gaze.</p> \n    <p align=\"center\">∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n    <p>Though the trail left by\
  \ the undead lasted longer in the heat of the day than any mundane frost had a right\
  \ to, by noon it had all but vanished. Within the next hour, it was gone completely.\
  \ Still, Jasilia and Nekhtep pushed on to the east. They had followed the trail,\
  \ threading through valleys of sand and climbing the faces of myriad dunes and down\
  \ their precipitous slipfaces, long enough that Jasilia, with her long-practiced\
  \ desert senses, had a rough estimate of their quarry's direction. Even so, they\
  \ were heading into the deep desert, and she knew how far off course they might\
  \ find themselves if they deviated even a tenth of a degree from their intended\
  \ destination.</p> \n    <p>Nekhtep, for his part, had remained quiet since the\
  \ outset of their journey. It was as if he had decided it was better to let Jasilia\
  \ come to understand the futility of their quest on her own rather than press the\
  \ matter. At least that was her best guess. Who knew what the man was thinking?\
  \ It wasn't important anyway. All that mattered now was getting Ojan back.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Jasilia cursed. \"We must be halfway to the Glazen Sheets by now!\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Not even a quarter of the way, I'm afraid.\" Nekhtep shook his flask,\
  \ his features creased with worry as the water sloshed hollowly within. \"You know\
  \ the old saying. 'A walk in the desert is worth four in Sothis.'\"</p> \n    <p>Jasilia\
  \ said nothing. She could feel the truth of the adage as the sand gave way beneath\
  \ the camel's every step. She could feel it in the rise of every dune they climbed,\
  \ in every slight detour they took through the valleys of sand. All of these things\
  \ conspired to elongate the distance to their destination, wherever it might lie.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The hardship of desert travel was a lesson she had learned in her bones\
  \ from an early age, when she and Ojan had been but rebellious children escaping\
  \ into the sands to elude the ever-watchful eyes of their strict and ever-so-boring\
  \ royal keepers. <i>Dune runners</i>, one of their tutors had once spat at the two\
  \ twins, as if it were a curse. The intractable royal siblings had immediately seized\
  \ on the epithet, pridefully signing their runaway notes with the sobriquet before\
  \ each escape attempt, setting it in the royal case to give the title the proper\
  \ respect: <i>Give our regards to our brother, His Majesty the Pharaoh. Yours truly,\
  \ The Dune Runners</i>.</p> \n    <p>The memory brought a smile to her lips, and\
  \ she mused on how little things had changed. Did not the Ruby Prince still forbid\
  \ their research expeditions into the deep desert? Were not multiple squads of the\
  \ Risen Guard at this very moment scouring the every crook and qanat across the\
  \ land in search of the now-adult twins? Had not her older brother—knowing full\
  \ well Jasilia and Ojan would stubbornly ignore his royal command not to leave Sothis\
  \ and instead run off to pursue their insatiable inquiries into Osirion's past—\
  assigned Nekhtep to be her ever-present bodyguard to ease his worries?</p> \n  \
  \  <p>She licked her cracked lips, feeling the scant moisture upon them immediately\
  \ evaporate into the dry air. As they paused to let Yamala catch her breath after\
  \ cresting a steep dune, Jasilia looked back and noticed Nekhtep staring intently\
  \ to the northeast. She turned to follow his gaze, a thrill of both exhilaration\
  \ and fear running through her as her vision settled on the object of his interest.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Wavering in the heat perhaps two miles ahead, immense turreted bulwarks\
  \ of reddish stone rose up, half buried, out of the steep and drifting sands. Figures\
  \ made tiny by distance swarmed like ants between the crenellated wall walks, while\
  \ droves other of small forms swathed the great rises of sand shrouding the lower\
  \ portions of the massive structure. The latter figures seemed to be concentrated\
  \ along the base of the walls, where great clouds of dust wafted on the wind as\
  \ if kicked up by the workers' furious excavation of the fortress from the dunes.\
  \ All told, the horde swarming the sands must have numbered at least a hundred,\
  \ and that didn't account for any others that might reside within the walls.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"What was that you said about going to Shiman-Sekh to get reinforcements?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>In answer to her question, Nekhtep began to turn Yamala back around\
  \ the way they had come. Even as he did so the strong winds shifted, buffeting them\
  \ with a malodorous gale. It was a stench all too familiar to Jasilia—the fetor\
  \ of the crypt.</p> \n    <p>Yamala reared back, bleating in terror and nearly throwing\
  \ her riders to the scalding sands. Nekhtep's arm tightened viselike about Jasilia.\
  \ She heard the sound of steel on leather as the Risen Guard drew his blade.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The patrol of undead soldiers came at them from all directions.</p> \n\
