  \    </table> \n    <p><b>Question #4 Solution:</b> This week's question was incredibly\
  \ tough, but congratulations are due to Rob McCreary, who gave the correct answer\
  \ of \"7 pounds.\" Rob will receive a pair of <i>Rise of the Runelords Item Card</i>\
  \ decks and a signed copy of the limited edition alternate cover version of <i>Patherfinder\
  \ #1</i>.</p> \n    <p>To solve this riddle, you need to know a couple of things.\
  \ First, you need to know that <i>Pathfinder #3</i> contains a wandering monster\
  \ chart for Varisia on page 71. Second, you need the overland movement charts from\
  \ pages 162 and 164 of the PH. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, to correctly\
  \ answer this question, you need to remember that giants have a chance of carrying\
  \ salt in their bags (MM page 120). Taking the information given, the journey there\
  \ and back requires a total of 8 days in the mountains and 20 days on the plateau.\
  \ With a 20% chance of encounter per hour (and not just while traveling, but more\
  \ on this below), you would run into 38.4 encounters in the mountains and 96 while\
  \ traversing the plateau. Of these encounters, 20% of the mountain encounters would\
  \ be with giants, while only 10% of those in the plateau would be against these\
  \ salt-carrying behemoths. If each encounter was against 4 giants, each with 5 items\
  \ in its bag, you would gather a total of 345.6 items from their bags. Of these,\
  \ 1 in 50 would be a 1-pound bag of salt. So, upon returning to Skull's Crossing\
  \ you would have 6.912 pounds of salt, rounded up to 7. Due to the phrasing of the\
  \ question, some of you assumed that encounters only occurred while traveling, which\
  \ would cut the number of encounters by 2/3. Due to this confusion, I also decided\
  \ to accept any answer of \"2.\"</p> \n    <p>We received a total of 37 entries\
  \ for this particular question, with a wide variety of numbers, from 0 to 68,000.\
  \ What was more interesting, though, were the answers by those who assumed it was\
  \ a trick question or just decided to submit a joke. The first answer we received\
  \ was simply, \"potato.\" We knew we had a good question when that one popped into\
  \ the inbox. In the following days, we got answers such as \"as much as you started\
  \ with,\" \"rock salt or sea salt?,\" and my personal favorite, \"I would have zero\
  \ pounds of salt on me, upon my return, since I'm trying to cut down on my intake.\"\
  \ A hearty congratulations are due to all seven entrants who managed to get the\
  \ correct answer on this one, and I think you can all look forward to more twisted\
  \ puzzlers like this one in future contests.</p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <p>Jason Bulmahn\
