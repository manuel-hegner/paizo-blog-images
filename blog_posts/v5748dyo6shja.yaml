  \    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Over the past couple months,\
  \ there’s been a lot of speculation about what our next book might be, and what\
  \ classes and rules might be contained within its pages. Wonder no more! It is my\
  \ pleasure to announce <em>Pathfinder Guns &amp; Gears</em>, slated for release\
  \ in late fall of 2021.</p> \n     <p>Golarion is a world of magic and mystery,\
  \ but it’s also a world of clockwork soldiers, pistol-twirling pirates, and marvelous\
  \ innovations. With gnome tinkers in Absalom, clockwork mages in New Thassilon,\
  \ dwarf snipers in Alkenstar, and the gun mages of distant Arcadia, Golarion offers\
  \ a wide array of character concepts that haven’t been supported in Pathfinder Second\
  \ Edition until now. <em>Guns &amp; Gears</em> will include rules for siege engines,\
  \ firearms, clockwork inventions, and vehicles unlike anything released so far.\
  \ On top of that, we’ll be introducing two new classes, both of which you’ll be\
  \ able to see <a href=\"https://paizo.com/pathfinderplaytest\">in this month’s playtest</a>.</p>\

  \ Art by Roberto Pitturru</p>\n     </div> \n     <p>The first class marks the return\
  \ of a Pathfinder First Edition favorite. As many of you have probably guessed,\
  \ the gunslinger has returned! This is a brand-new version of an old favorite: the\
  \ gunslinger has been rebuilt from the ground up with new subclasses and abilities\
  \ unique to Pathfinder Second Edition, including a sniper subclass specializing\
  \ in devastating opening attacks. Bonus points for those of you who might not be\
  \ as enthused about having firearms in your home games: we’re playtesting the gunslinger\
  \ with built-in options for replacing firearms with crossbows. Now, your snipers\
  \ and drifters can find their place in any campaign! And no, playing a character\
  \ with this option won’t require a feat or archetype!</p> \n     <p>The gunslinger\
  \ is joined by the first class entirely new and unique to Pathfinder Second Edition:\
  \ the inventor. Master gadgeteers, inventors can interact with mechanical devices\
  \ in the heat of combat to influence the direction of the fight, leverage their\
  \ powerful innovations to deal out devastating attacks, or transform themselves\
  \ into unbreakable armored bulwarks. Other inventors might prefer to instead rely\
  \ on their trusty clockwork companions to hold the line while these PCs use their\
  \ skills and cunning to heal or support the party.</p> \n     <p>With the launch\
  \ of today’s playtest, you’ll be able to check both of these classes out for yourself\
  \ and see what they bring to the game! We’re excited to hear your thoughts and insights\
  \ over the next month as we work to make these new classes the best they can be.</p>\
