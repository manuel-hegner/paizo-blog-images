  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Wednesday, May 21, 2008</p> \n   <p><a href=\"/store/v5748btpy80ib\"\
  >Darkmoon Vale</a> is a dangerous place (indeed, it hosts the modules D0, D1, D1.5,\
  \ E1, and LB1). Probably the most dangerous place in Andoran. But it does not exist\
  \ in a vacuum. To give you a sense of place regarding the vale and what's around\
  \ it, we present you with this sneak peek at the forthcoming <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy80ib\"\
  ><i>Guide to Darkmoon Vale</i></a>.</p> \n   <blockquote> \n    <h2>Neighbors</h2>\
  \ \n    <p>While civilization seems to actively avoid Darkmoon Vale, it has little\
  \ problem developing in the areas surrounding the insular vale. The following descriptions\
  \ offer a brief look at the largest or most influential civilized locations of interest\
  \ near Darkmoon Vale. The interaction of these locations with Valers varies greatly.</p>\
  \ \n    <p><b>Highhelm:</b> An ancient and expansive dwarven Sky Citadel within\
  \ and beneath lofty Emperor's Peak, Highhelm remains the center of dwarven culture\
  \ on Avistan, as it has for millennia. Northeast of Highhelm, dwarves control the\
  \ Five Kings Mountains with unquestioned authority, and passage among the many high\
  \ peaks remains relatively safe from living dangers. Dwarven caravans from Highhelm\
  \ seldom come to Darkmoon Vale, as most of them head west into Isger or Molthune.\
  \ Roughly two or three times a decade, though, a group of Highhelm merchants gathers\
  \ together and sends a caravan along the treacherous scree-covered trails that wind\
  \ perilously through the mountains. The dwarves prefer to hire dozens of mercenaries\
  \ to augment their tough dwarven guards and to act as arrow-fodder and spear-catchers\
  \ during the inevitable attacks on these wealthy caravans. </p> \n    <p><b>Oregent:</b>\
  \ This large city several miles south of Darkmoon Vale houses the main office of\
  \ the Lumber Consortium as well as its massive factory-like forges and sawmills.\
  \ The government and people of Oregent consider themselves friends and allies of\
  \ Darkmoon Vale, and particularly of Falcon's Hollow. Most newcomers to the vale\
  \ originate in Oregent, either as citizens of that city or as travelers passing\
  \ through from points south and east. In addition to company policies and replacement\
  \ lumberjacks, Oregent also provides Darkmoon Vale with its main connection to the\
  \ greater world beyond. Information flows into Olfden and Falcon's Hollow through\
  \ Oregent, and many Valers suspect the news provided to them also flows through\
  \ a Lumber Consortium filter, painting the company in the best possible light. </p>\
  \ \n    <p><b>Inn of the Wood:</b> Situated a short day's walk south of Olfden,\
  \ Inn of the Wood is a popular place to relax for those traveling to or from Darkmoon\
  \ Vale. The inn is the easiest place to find the sheriff of the Shire of Elberwick,\
  \ Cage Blunnde. It is also the only safe place to spend a night between Olfden and\
  \ Oregent, so it is frequently crowded. (For more information on the inn, see <a\
