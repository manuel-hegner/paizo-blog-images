  description\">When I joined Obsidian Entertainment last year, because of my background\
  \ as a tabletop game designer, I was asked if I wanted to work with the <a href=\"\
  https://pathfinder.obsidian.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Pathfinder Adventures</a> team.\
  \ Even though it meant having to work with Mike Selinker—<i>Hi, Mike!</i>—it sounded\
  \ like an awful lot of fun to go back to my card game roots for a bit and, frankly,\
  \ I flat-out love the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame\">Pathfinder Adventure\
  \ Card Game</a>. So I said yes—of course I'd love to see what cool things we could\
  \ bring to the game on the electronic side that simply aren't possible in the physical\
  \ space.</p> \n    <p>Our biggest goal was to expand replayability to make sure\
  \ the electronic version of the game is an amazing value with tons and tons of fun\
  \ gameplay. The first step was working out the difficulty system that Nathan has\
  \ <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5likm\">already talked about</a>, which allows you\
  \ to play the same scenario multiple times and still have it feel fresh and fun.\
  \ The wildcard powers in particular mix things up so that even when you replay the\
  \ same scenario you just completed, things still feel new.</p> \n    <p>But that's\
  \ still essentially replaying the same scenarios that many of us have already played\
  \ over and over. Couldn't we use the computer running the game to generate a new\
  \ adventure whenever we want one, so that we'll <i>always</i> have fresh scenarios\
  \ to play? Thus, the concept of Quest Mode was born: Mixing and matching existing\
  \ scenario powers, locations, villains, and henchmen to create new experiences.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/20160517-Screen1.jpg\"\
  >\n     <br> <i>Quest Mode, engaged!</i>\n    </div> \n    <h2>How Random Is Too\
  \ Random?</h2> \n    <p>Randomness is great, but sometimes things that are truly\
  \ random are also truly terrible—my first CD player's random mode once repeated\
  \ the same song four times in a row. That's entirely possible in a truly random\
  \ system (even if there's only a 1:1,728 chance of it happening on a 12-song album),\
  \ but it's still not what you want. Randomness is supposed to keep things fresh!</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20160517-Screen2_360.jpeg\"\
  >\n    </div> \n    <p>So we looked at places where randomness would result in less\
  \ fun. A perfect example of this is the scenario Local Heroes. It's a fun scenario,\
  \ but it completely breaks down in Quest Mode's \"grab a scenario and add a villain\
  \ and some henchmen\" mechanic. First problem: there's no villain! And what if you're\
  \ randomly given a bunch of locations that don't have many allies—or <i>any</i>\
  \ allies? The whole thing can grind to a halt.</p> \n    <p>So we pulled things\
  \ like this out of the pool of possible combinations. If a card wasn't going to\
  \ play nice with Quest Mode, it had to step away from Quest Mode... for now. We\
  \ ended up with 10 scenario powers, 10 villains, more than 20 sets of henchmen,\
  \ and multiple maps, so there are more than 10,000 different adventures to be had—\
  and that's before you start calculating different location configurations (and linkages\
  \ for Legendary difficulty!) and possible wildcard combinations.</p> \n    <p>We\
  \ do have the ability to build connections beyond pure randomness, so as we're able\
  \ to spend more time developing Quest Mode, more \"hand-crafted\" adventures will\
  \ be appearing. Certain combinations of scenarios, villains, and maps that are designed\
  \ to work together will appear together more frequently (or even exclusively together).</p>\
  \ \n    <h2>Bring on the XP!</h2> \n    <p>Another cool thing we can do in Quest\
  \ Mode is bring the game a little closer to its tabletop RPG roots. We knew as soon\
  \ as we started talking about this mode that we wanted to use an XP and leveling\
  \ system where you'd get XP for each monster and obstacle you overcome in addition\
  \ to the usual rewards for finishing a scenario. That level of granularity for tracking\
  \ progression would get in the way with the tabletop game, but it's something we\
  \ can do well in the electronic space. That meant we could have many levels for\
  \ progression, and therefore more rewards.</p> \n    <p>Speaking of progression,\
  \ we need to call out and give a big thanks to the Pathfinder Society—the <a href=\"\
  /pfsacg\">PFS Adventure Card Guild</a> progression system gave us a very clear path\
  \ for developing our Quest Mode progression.</p> \n    <h2>The Future of Quest Mode</h2>\
  \ \n    <p>So, that's a little look at the history of Quest Mode. But what does\
  \ the future hold? One of the first new things coming to Quest Mode will be hand-crafted\
  \ scenarios that deliver new scenarios, villains, and henchmen that players haven't\
  \ seen before, and special combinations that raise the challenge level higher than\
  \ we've seen before—with commensurate rewards, of course! And after that?</p> \n\
  \    <p>Well, the obvious direction is \"bigger and better.\" Frankly, I'm not allowed\
  \ to tell you too much more yet. But the thing to remember is that since Quest Mode\
  \ is outside the boundaries of the Rise of the Runelords storyline that Paizo and\
  \ Lone Shark delivered, Obsidian has a bit more freedom to roam and present new\
  \ characters, stories, and rewards! I know that I'm genuinely excited about it,\
  \ and I think everyone will really enjoy it.</p> \n    <p>David Williams<br> <i>Pathfinder\
