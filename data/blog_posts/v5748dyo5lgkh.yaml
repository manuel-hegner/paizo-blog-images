  \ \n    <p class=\"date\">by Dylan Birtolo</p> \n    <h2>Chapter One: The Man in\
  \ the Woods</h2> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Marra crept forward, easing her\
  \ weight from her heel onto the flat of her foot, making sure that no branches snapped\
  \ underneath her weight and betrayed her presence. She held her bow at her side,\
  \ an arrow nocked in place and locked under her forefinger. It was too early to\
  \ bring the weapon to bear; the distance was too great. She needed to be closer\
  \ to make an accurate shot. In front of her, an elk reached down to rip up some\
  \ grass with his teeth, blissfully unaware of her presence. The animal snorted and\
  \ jerked its head up.</p> \n    <p>Marra froze. If she stood still, he might not\
  \ notice her. The elk looked around and sniffed at the air, its large nostrils flaring.\
  \ Marra held her breath.</p> \n    <p>After a few seconds, the animal lowered its\
  \ muzzle back to the ground and continued to graze. The tension in Marra's shoulders\
  \ eased as she saw the elk go back to its routine. This was as close as she dared\
  \ to get. Any closer and she would risk spooking the beast. It had been a long time\
  \ since she had some fresh hide to tan and she couldn't afford to let this specimen\
  \ get away. She was already deeper in the Fangwood than she had ever been, and these\
  \ woods were far from safe, even before the bandits.</p> \n    <p>Marra pushed the\
  \ thought from her mind. She didn't have time to worry about that now. She raised\
  \ her bow and pointed the arrow at her target. In her mind's eye, she pictured the\
  \ path the arrow would take and where it would sink deep into the elk's flesh. She\
  \ breathed in deeply and eased the air out. Once she finished exhaling, she drew\
  \ back to her cheek and loosed the arrow in one smooth motion.</p> \n    <p>The\
  \ arrow whistled as it cut through the air and landed with a solid thunk deep in\
  \ the elk's side just behind his left foreleg. The elk bolted, sprinting forward\
  \ and crashing through the underbrush without even bothering to look for its attacker.\
  \ Marra snatched another arrow from the quiver on her hip, but by the time the shaft\
  \ was nocked, the elk was too deep in the brush for her to have a shot. She kept\
  \ the arrow in place, but lowered the bow to her side as she walked forward.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Her steps were slow and measured as she followed the elk's obvious trail.\
  \ There was no need to rush. The wound was deep and she was confident she had pierced\
  \ the animal's lung. If so, the elk's run would be short and she'd soon be back\
  \ on her way to her tannery. If not, there was no way she would catch a fleeing\
  \ elk. Up ahead, the sounds of the animal's mad dash continued, spooking birds out\
  \ of the trees with the sudden noise. </p> \n    <p>As she walked, Marra's thoughts\
  \ fled back to the bandits. They'd been more active recently, even north of the\
  \ Marideth River. She knew they were Molthuni. Everyone knew it was the Molthuni.\
  \ But their strong and honorable allies to the north in Lastwall claimed that it\
  \ was just a simple bandit problem internal to Nimrathas and did not require any\
  \ intervention on their part. At least that was the story Marra heard the last time\
  \ she had taken her leather to Tamran. The politics of the situation sickened her.\
  \ She wished there was something that she could do to chase the Molthuni off, but\
  \ she wasn't a politician or a noble, and there was little more a tanner could do\
  \ than help to keep her own home and neighbors safe.</p> \n    <p>Marra grabbed\
  \ a fallen piece of wood in her right hand and used it to hack at the branches around\
  \ her as she walked. With each stroke she remembered the last time the bandits raided\
  \ her village. She was working in the shop and heard the screams, rushing out still\
  \ carrying her tongs and carving knife. Four men rode into the village with torches\
  \ and swords, too well made to be the spoils of scavenging. They trampled anyone\
  \ too slow to get out of their way. They didn't attempt to make demands; they attacked,\
  \ threw their torches into whatever flammable roof or crop they could find, and\
  \ fled. The villagers were lucky and managed to keep the fire from spreading and\
  \ causing too much damage.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb180\">\n     <a href=\"http://static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-KnightlyMission-Marra.jpg\"\

  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n     <br> At heart, Marra Silvermoon is no simple tanner.\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>Up ahead, a loud crash followed by silence signaled the fall\
  \ of the elk and jerked Marra back to the present. She dropped her stick and picked\
  \ up her pace. It wasn't long before she came upon the animal collapsed in the dirt.\
  \ The beast's chest rose and fell as it struggled to breathe, legs twitching across\
  \ the ground. The arrow had broken off, but Marra could see the wound, the small\
  \ hole still pouring out blood that bubbled as the elk exhaled. Marra took her knife\
  \ from her belt and ended the elk's suffering.</p> \n    <p>She unslung her pack\
  \ and took out the leather and cord inside. With practiced motions, she created\
  \ a simple travois and laid it next to the elk corpse. Putting her bow aside, she\
  \ knelt down next to the corpse and began cleaning it, cutting off large strips\
  \ of skin to treat back at her workshop and large strips of meat for food. She wrapped\
  \ the meat inside the skin to protect it before she laid it on the sled in pieces.\
  \ There was no way she could drag the entire corpse. A lot of it would go to waste,\
  \ but she would take back as much as she could drag.</p> \n    <p>Cleaning the animal\
  \ was difficult work and it wasn't long before sweat beaded on her brow. She reached\
  \ up and brushed the back of one arm across it, careful to make sure none of the\
  \ blood dripped into her eyes. As she lowered her arm, she heard a low rumbling\
  \ growl off to her left. Marra flicked her eyes in that direction, not wanting to\
  \ make any sudden motions.</p> \n    <p>Between a few of the trunks she saw a group\
  \ of three wolves stalking forward, the one in front growling as it peeled back\
  \ its lips. Marra glanced back at her bow, useless on the ground a few feet away.\
  \ Her fingers flexed on her carving knife. It wasn't much, but it was all she had.\
  \ The wolves took a few more steps and then froze, the one in front looking bigger\
  \ as its fur stood up. Yet it did not advance, and the others didn't circle around.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Wolves were something she knew, having watched them and dealt with them\
  \ all her life. Marra's legs tensed in anticipation as she slowed her breathing,\
  \ paying attention to the sounds around her while she unfocused her eyes from the\
  \ wolves in front of her. They were not the real threat. They were the distraction,\
  \ there to keep her from running away.</p> \n    <p>A snap from behind burst her\
  \ into motion. She pivoted on her right foot, moving out of the way and leading\
  \ with her knife in a vicious spin. The wolf that charged her from behind tried\
  \ to spring back when she moved, but it wasn't fast enough. Her blade cut deep into\
  \ the animal's shoulder, tearing through the flesh and making it yelp as it retreated\
  \ from her attack.</p> \n    <p>Now that she was moving, Marra looked around and\
  \ saw five wolves surrounding her, including the one she had just injured. It was\
  \ the largest and she guessed it would be the leader. Despite its injury, it stalked\
  \ back and forth in front of her, just out of her reach. Every few steps it would\
  \ lunge forward and snap, but spring back before she had a chance to attack. The\
  \ other wolves moved around to circle her and the fresh elk carcass.</p> \n    <p>Marra\
  \ knew she needed to end this quickly. There was no way she'd stand for long against\
  \ a pack of wolves. Her only hope was to deal with the alpha and hope the others\
  \ fled. She took a step back, then another, turning to make sure she never left\
  \ her back to one wolf for too long. Every time she turned away, one of them would\
  \ snap forward, never close enough to connect but getting closer and bolder with\
  \ each lunge. Out of the corner of her eye, Marra saw her bow resting on the ground\
  \ next to her foot. She dug her boot into the soft ground, getting it underneath\
  \ the bow.</p> \n    <p>Marra spun again, this time turning to face the alpha. She\
  \ threw her knife at the beast, but it jumped to the side before the weapon came\
  \ close. She hadn't expected to hit. Even before the wolf's feet touched the ground\
  \ again, she kicked the bow up, catching it in her left hand. She whipped an arrow\
  \ out of her quiver and nocked it, pulling back and letting fly in the space of\
  \ a breath. The arrow slammed into the wolf's chest and the beast let out a sound\
  \ that was both a howl of pain and yip of surprise. Marra spun, getting a second\
  \ arrow ready and launching it at one of the wolves behind her. The missile streaked\
  \ past the wolf, but was close enough to graze its skin as it passed. Marra didn't\
  \ wait to see animal's reaction, spinning with a third arrow ready to face the next\
  \ closest attacker.</p> \n    <p>The wolves turned and fled as Marra loosed her\
  \ third arrow, striking a wolf in the backside. It ran faster, trying to catch up\
  \ to its pack mates. Marra watched them run, ready to attack again if they turned,\
  \ but having no interest in pursuing them. She already had her prize and it was\
  \ more meat and pelt than she could carry back.</p> \n    <p>Once the wolves were\
  \ gone, Marra reclaimed her dagger and rushed to finish the job of collecting as\
  \ much as she could drag. She kept her bow close to her body and tried to stay alert\
  \ to the forest around her. It wasn't long before she had the travois loaded as\
  \ much as she dared. She cleaned off her blade before tucking it back into her belt\
  \ and used the dirt and fallen leaves to clean her hands as best she could. Satisfied\
  \ with her prize, Marra grunted as she picked up the front end of the travois and\
  \ started the long trek back home.</p> \n    <p>It was slow going, bringing the\
  \ meat and hide back through the woods. Marra took a different path, one that would\
  \ bring her straight back rather than following the game trails like she did on\
  \ her way in. Her path was not subtle or quiet, but she wasn't concerned about other\
  \ predators. Most of them resided deeper in the woods and each step brought her\
  \ close to safe territory.</p> \n    <p>So it shocked her into stillness when she\
  \ heard a loud crash in front of her. Marra rushed to unhitch herself from the travois,\
  \ trying to make sure she could fight or flee depending on the situation. She had\
  \ just gotten out of the harness when a group of three elk cut across her path and\
  \ then bounded away. That didn't make sense. They would have been able to smell\
  \ the elk carcass and would never have run toward her, unless something scared them\
  \ enough to override their innate precautions. Marra crept forward, curious to know\
  \ what could have spooked them.</p> \n    <p>As she peered around a tree, she saw\
  \ what had made the animals panic. A man in armor rested against the trunk of a\
  \ tree, sprawled out as if he had fallen there. His chainmail shirt was torn in\
  \ a few pieces, but the solid breastplate was still intact. He had engraved leather\
  \ pauldrons and leather armor on his arms as well. A sword lay in the dirt near\
  \ him, just a few inches from his hand. He did not appear to be breathing.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Marra walked up to him, looking around for any signs of what might have\
  \ killed him, but the only thing she saw was the trail he carved getting to this\
  \ place before collapsing. When she got next to his body, she reached down and held\
  \ her hand in front of his face. He wasn't breathing.</p> \n    <p>When she rolled\
  \ the man onto his back, she saw why—he had a large hole in his chainmail on his\
  \ side just below his breastplate. The wound smelled of rotted flesh and Marra had\
  \ to hold her breath to calm her churning stomach.</p> \n    <p>For several moments\
  \ she knelt there, looking over the corpse. When her gaze fell upon his belt buckle,\
  \ she gasped in surprise. It was engraved with the symbol of the knights of Lastwall.</p>\
