  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Today, during Paizo Publisher\
  \ and Chief Creative Officer Erik Mona’s “Paizo in 2020 and Beyond” seminar from\
  \ Gen Con Online’s virtual main stage, we announced a partnership with Beadle &amp;\
  \ Grimm’s, whose high production values on campaign support materials for D&amp;D\
  \ have been incredibly well-received in recent years. They approached us not about\
  \ making campaign props and such, but rather for something entirely new that both\
  \ they and we here at Paizo HQ are incredibly excited about: Complete Character\
  \ Chronicles! I’ll let the guys from Beadle &amp; Grimm’s explain their vision and\
  \ plan themselves, but wanted to officially welcome them to the Paizo family and\
  \ express our enthusiasm about what’s to come.</p> \n     <p style=\"margin-left:\

  \ \n     <blockquote> \n      <p>Over the past year or so, people have become increasingly\
  \ aware that Beadle and Grimm aren’t just random names we invented for marketing\
  \ purposes – they were actual characters that we played and loved for many years.\
  \ </p> \n      <p>With that awareness came a lot of questions – who were they? Where\
  \ did they adventure? What heroic feats did they accomplish? And we found ourselves\
  \ struggling to provide good answers. The passage of time made names and dates hard\
  \ to remember, and we often found ourselves mixing up one adventuring party with\
  \ another. What we were missing, we realized, was a book where all of our journeys\
  \ and exploits were immortalized – a sort of scrapbook for those characters and\
  \ the lives they lived. And that’s where the Complete Character Chronicle was born.</p>\

  \ Chronicles.</p>\n      </div> \n      <p>We had always wanted to work with Paizo,\
  \ so we set up a meeting and pitched them the idea. What if you could have a single\
  \ book that contained everything about one character, from birth to death? It would\
  \ need to be part journal, part character record, part scrapbook, and would also\
  \ need to contain the key reference pages from all the core rulebooks, so that you’\
  d have every rule, feat and spell right there at your fingertips. Would they allow\
  \ us access to all their rules, all their best art, and all their newest updates,\
  \ so we could make this the best character book of its kind?</p> \n      <p>Thankfully,\
  \ their answer was “Yes”. In fact, it was “Hell yes, and how can we help?” which\
  \ is about the best thing you can possibly hear. Now we’re working like mad to live\
  \ up to that promise. We want this to be the best character journal that you’ve\
  \ ever seen. We want it to be epic. We want it to be Platinum, because that’s what\
  \ your character deserves.</p> \n      <p>We’re grateful to Paizo for welcoming\
  \ us into their family. Please join the mailing list for our <a href=\"https://beadleandgrimms.com/pathfinder/kickstarter/chronicles\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Kickstarter this Fall</a>, and let us know what you want to\
  \ see next. We can’t wait to hear from you.</p> \n      <p>Sincerely,</p> <a href=\"\
