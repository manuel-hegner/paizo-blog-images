  \ itemprop=\"description\">It's been over a year since we introduced a new Paizo\
  \ editor to you all, but it's now my great pleasure to announce our latest hire:\
  \ Senior Editor Lyz Liddell, who has officially joined our ranks here in house after\
  \ almost 6 years of working with us remotely, first as a freelancer and then as\
  \ a contractor! I'll let her introduce herself in her own words...</p> \n    <blockquote>\
  \ \n     <p>Hullo, folks! I'm Lyz, and I'm sorta new around here! I just started\
  \ as a Real Employee™ this month, but I've been editing for Paizo in ever-growing\
  \ quantities for close to 6 years now, lurking in the wild realms of Contract Employment\
  \ (also known as Columbus, Ohio). Before that I was a freelance editor for a whole\
  \ bunch of d20/3.5 publishers, going back to the 3.5 heyday of the early aughties.\
  \ I've been gaming since high school, starting with 2nd Edition D&amp;D, Vampire:\
  \ The Masquerade, and Shadowrun as my go-to games. I've been riding the Pathfinder\
  \ wave since the days of the playtest for the original game (yeah, that paperback\
  \ beta rulebook in 2008). So I'm both a veteran and a noob, but either way, I'm\
  \ excited to be here!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <img src=\"\
  //cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190520-Lyz.jpg\">\n     </div> \n     <p>As\
  \ an editor, I make the words good, with a healthy dose of also making sure the\
  \ words work well in the context of the game and society at large—I'm a huge proponent\
  \ of inclusivity in gaming and work to throw out habits and tropes that marginalize\
  \ people or perpetuate harmful stereotypes. My hope, as an editor, is that you never\
  \ notice my work as you're enjoying the latest Pathfinder and Starfinder products—\
  because we've succeeded in presenting things clearly and cleanly with a minimum\
  \ of errors.</p> \n     <p>When I'm not editing, I'm often writing (mostly fantasy\
  \ novels and RPG material), cycling, cooking, canoeing, costuming, hiking, or performing\
  \ weird old music (I specialize in medieval, renaissance, and baroque woodwinds).\
  \ I realized my 3-year goal of driving to the office last month (a journey of 2,400\
  \ miles), and I am loving the Pacific Northwest! Even more, I'm loving the (admittedly\
  \ surreal at times) reality of sharing a workspace with the fantastic Paizo staff.</p>\
  \ \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Please join all of us in welcoming Lyz to Paizo!</p>\
