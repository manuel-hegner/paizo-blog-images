  date\">Monday, November 26, 2007</p> \n   <p>Recently, I put up a <a href=\"http://paizo.com/paizo/messageboards/gameMastery/general/helpUsGiveYouWhatYouWant\"\
  >messageboard thread</a> soliciting questions we might answer in the blog, and now\
  \ Sutter's tapped me to actually answer one of those questions. So here I go:</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Messageboard regular Dungeon Grrrl asks, \"When you decide to develop\
  \ a region, how do you go about it? Is there a process for the writing of a basic\
  \ bible, or is the final version generated whole-cloth? Is there a development process\
  \ that happens after the writers tackle it? Do you have big meetings where people\
  \ spitball ideas?\"</p> \n   <p>Let's take these one at a time. </p> \n   <p><b>When\
  \ you decide to develop a region, how do you go about it?</b></p> \n   <p>The very\
  \ first thing that gets decided is which region or area we want to develop. The\
  \ needs of adventures (whether adventure paths in <i>Pathfinder</i> or scattered\
  \ modules) take center stage. The <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7zdc\"><i>Guide to Korvosa</i></a>,\
  \ for example, fleshes out the city in which the Curse of the Crimson Throne adventure\
  \ path occurs. The <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy80ib\"><i>Guide to Darkmoon Vale</i></a>,\
  \ on the other hand, delves into the region where we set <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7xpy\"\
  ><i>D0: Hollow's Last Hope</i></a>, <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7yqz\"><i>D1: Crown\
  \ of the Kobold King</i></a>, <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7x86\"><i>E1: Carnival of\
  \ Tears</i></a>, and the LB series of GameMastery Modules. </p>\n   <p>Once we figure\
  \ out where we want the book to cover, we need to find someone to write it. For\
  \ Korvosa, that entailed James Jacobs walking up to me one day and saying, \"Do\
  \ you want to write Korvosa?\" You can guess my answer. For Darkmoon Vale, it was\
  \ Erik who asked me the same question (with the same reply). </p>\n   <p>At that\
  \ point, we have where we want to set the book and we have an author. The third\
  \ step is to brainstorm what we want to see in the book (in terms of NPCs, locations,\
  \ monsters, and events). </p>\n   <p>After that, it's just the author putting his\
  \ nose to the grindstone and writing ~50,000 words. </p> \n   <p><b>Is there a process\
  \ for the writing of a basic bible, or is the final version generated whole-cloth?</b></p>\
  \ \n   <p>The final version is pretty much generated whole-cloth. We have a Golarion\
  \ world-bible that we can all access and that parts of will turn into the <a href=\"\
  /store/v5748btpy7zda\"><i>Pathfinder Chronicles Gazetteer</i></a>, which helps us\
  \ with world consistency, but the final version of a guidebook <i>becomes</i> the\
  \ bible for the area in which it focuses.</p> \n   <p><b>Is there a development\
  \ process that happens after the writers tackle it?</b></p> \n   <p>Yes. Once I\
  \ completed Korvosa, James took a read-through to look for things he needed for\
  \ the adventure path that I forgot to add or didn't know about. Then I took a week\
  \ or so, added in all that stuff, and handed over Korvosa version 1.2, which Jeremy\
  \ Walker currently has and is editing. Because there are only four pages of rules\
  \ stuff in Korvosa, his development pass is probably going to be more like an editing/consistency-check\
  \ pass.</p> \n   <p><b>Do you have big meetings where people spitball ideas?</b></p>\
  \ \n   <p>Yes. We start off with a brainstorming meeting. For <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7zdc\"\
  ><i>Guide to Korvosa</i></a>, the brainstorm consisted of James Jacobs, Wes Schneider,\
  \ and myself, with Nick Logue, Richard Pett, and Tito Leati contributing awesome\
  \ ideas via email. For <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy80ib\"><i>Guide to Darkmoon Vale</i></a>,\
  \ the brainstorm group consisted of the entire R&amp;D staff plus Josh Frost and\
  \ Jeff Alvarez. </p>\n   <p>The team sits down and decides what sorts of NPCs, monsters,\
  \ and locations need to appear in the book. No real details get put out at this\
  \ point, because we're just trying to hit on the major aspects of the book. The\
  \ details get left to the author, for the most part. </p> \n   <p>I hope this helps\
  \ to give you a glimpse into Paizo Behind the Scenes. Feel free to throw follow-up\
  \ questions at me and the rest of the R&amp;D gang on the messageboards. Thanks\
  \ for reading!</p> \n   <p>Mike McArtor <br>Associate Editor, GameMastery </p> \n\
