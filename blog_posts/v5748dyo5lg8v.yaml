  >Three weeks ago</a>, we briefly discussed the impact of faction PCs' decisions\
  \ in the campaign and how these decisions have shaped the direction that these factions\
  \ are going. The following week on the <a href=\"http://35privatesanctuary.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;id=35&amp;Itemid=34\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Know Direction podcast</a>, John Compton expanded on what this\
  \ evolution might entail for many factions: name changes, shifting goals, and even\
  \ changes in leadership. <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lg87\">Most recently</a>,\
  \ we shared how the Andoran an Cheliax factions are developing over time.</span></p>\
  \ \n    <p>As advertised over a year ago, the so-called nation-based factions have\
  \ spent the past season (or longer for some like the Cheliax faction) distancing\
  \ themselves from their parent countries to embrace less territorial and more broadly\
  \ philosophical endeavors. When the Pathfinder Society Organized Play leaders began\
  \ discussing how factions would change, we looked at the reporting numbers contributed\
  \ by players worldwide and carefully considered how the faction might change to\
  \ reflect this information while still appealing to a large percentage of its members.\
  \ For example, members of the Silver Crusade faction tend to be good guys, so changing\
  \ that faction to be neutrally aligned would discourage a lot of players.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Both of our factions for today tap into the past in the hope of creating\
  \ a better world, though their methods and vision of what constitutes \"better\"\
  \ differ. Be warned that there are some light spoilers from Season 5 scenarios referenced\
  \ below—particularly for the Scarab Sages and developments that appear in the <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy93m0\"><i>Destiny of the Sands</i></a> trilogy.</p> \n  \

  \   <h2>Scarab Sages: Unlock the Wisdom of the Past for a Brighter Future</h2> \n\
  \     <p>Nearly two years ago, agents of the Osirion faction brought a collection\
  \ of Thassilonian relics to offer to the Ruby Prince Khemet III. One of these relics\
  \ was cursed, and it afflicted the Ruby Prince with a terrible wasting affliction.\
  \ Despite the faction's attempts to find a cure, they were unable to remove the\
  \ curse, and the monarch resorted to powerful magic to be rid of it. Disappointed\
  \ by Amenopheus and his agents both for overlooking the curse and failing to remove\
  \ it, Khemet III dismissed the Sapphire Sage and the Pathfinder allies from his\
  \ service.</p> \n     <p>Season 5 has given Amenopheus ample time to catch up on\
  \ past projects, including researching the mysterious order of Jeweled Sages to\
  \ which he belongs (and appeared to be the last surviving member). About a year\
  \ ago we discovered that he is not alone, when faction PCs began to hear rumors\
  \ about the Diamond Sage and learned the secret history of the Jeweled Sages (as\
  \ well as how Amenopheus gained his power and wisdom). With the assistance of Osirion\
  \ faction PCs, the two sages have reestablished their order independent of the Osirian\
  \ state, intent on recruiting new sages to those replaced millennia ago, securing\
  \ ancient secrets, and disseminating that lore to modern innovators to spark a new\
  \ golden age of thought and technology. Working with the Pathfinder Society to unearth\
  \ these secrets is only logical.</p> \n     <p>How will the Osirion faction be different?\
  \ Although the faction may not be a direct agent of Osirion, there's still a great\
  \ deal in that nation that ties into the Jeweled Sages; the faction will still have\
  \ plenty to do in its old stomping ground. The faction is also interested in recruiting\
  \ new sages, which means recovering the lost sage jewels and finding worthy inheritors\
  \ of that power. The leadership of the faction remains up in the air, so there's\
  \ still time to influence that aspect. Despite these subtle shifts, the faction\
  \ remains a strong choice for scholars and Osirion enthusiasts alike.</p> \n   \
  \  <h2>Sovereign Court: Nobility United for a Common Cause</h2> \n     <p>For an\
  \ empire in decline, war is both a blessing and a curse. On one hand it drains resources\
  \ from already dwindling coffers. On the other hand, it provides a cause to rally\
  \ behind, spurring squabbling houses to cooperate and struggling industries to increase\
  \ production. Such was Lady Gloriana Morilla's thinking when she tried to convince\
  \ the Taldan nobility to send more support to Mendev to combat the Worldwound. In\
  \ numerous campaigns that united nations against a common evil, Taldor had led the\
  \ charge, so why not do so again and return Taldor to the spotlight?</p> \n    \
  \ <p>Although Lady Morilla found a few like-minded allies at home, many of her peers\
  \ laughed off the idea. Sending more troops north would leave the southern border\
  \ vulnerable to Qadiran aggression, argued some, whereas others simply laughed off\
  \ the idea as idle fancy by an upstart who had spent more time in Absalom than in\
  \ Oppara. Since words were not enough, Lady Morilla raised a self-styled Army of\
  \ Exploration (which sees action in an upcoming scenario) with the assistance of\
  \ Taldor faction PCs. The idea had been to inspire Taldor's leadership to party\
  \ less and lead more. In this regard she failed, for the majority have not changed\
  \ their attitudes and view her campaign as an amusing curiosity. Taldor is not a\
  \ lost cause, but its inertia is too great for the faction to change it on its own.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Instead, Lady Morilla is examining some of the unintended fruits of\
  \ the faction's work—in particular the stronger relationships she has with several\
  \ noble houses in other nations. What if, rather than work exclusively in Taldor,\
  \ the faction instead worked through other nations' leadership to create a network\
  \ of like-minded aristocrats that all promote the virtues of nobility and strong\
  \ governance? This secretive sovereign court would have an agenda all its own, not\
  \ one tied to any one nation. Under Lady Morilla's leadership, the faction focuses\
  \ on second-tier nobility of each nation, using them to act as the powers behind\
  \ their respective thrones to steer national policy. Perhaps years or decades in\
  \ the future, this shared vision will birth a new continent-spanning empire through\
  \ politics rather than conquest—one that will bring prosperity and peace to the\
  \ Inner Sea region.</p> \n     <p>What does this mean for the Taldor faction? Glory\
  \ and politics are still central themes for the faction, and it's still a great\
  \ home for those who love both audacious action and court intrigue. Nothing stops\
  \ PCs from being active in Taldor, but the goal is now something bigger and bolder.\
  \ Of course, the Pathfinder Society is happy to have the Sovereign Court as an ally,\
  \ for friendly nobles are more likely to allow Pathfinders into countries where\
  \ the Society had once been banned.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Happy gaming!</p>\
