  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">by Josh Vogt</p> \n   <h2>Chapter One: Blind Beggar’s Bind</h2>\
  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p>\"Alms!\" Larem called to the afternoon\
  \ marketplace crowd. \"Have mercy and spare a coin. A blind man's blessing brings\
  \ good fortune.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Droble gamman! Obbly tolt!\"</p> <span itemprop=\"\
  description\"><p>Larem winced as Dargley spouted his usual gibberish. He leaned\
  \ over and nudged his fellow beggar.</p></span> \n    <p>\"You're to keep your lips\

  \ may be blind, but he's still more perceptive than most people.\n    </div> \n\
  \    <p>Despite the leather strap over his eyes, Larem sensed Dargley beaming a\
  \ grin in clueless innocence, the attitude that had defined his existence since\
  \ the head injury. Sighing, Larem took up his beggar bowl and shook the three copper\
  \ coins it held. </p> \n    <p>\"Alms,\" he cried. \"Desna smiles upon those who\
  \ pity the downtrodden.\"</p> \n    <p>Shouting rose above the din of Magnimarian\
  \ hawkers, livestock, and cart traffic. </p> \n    <p>\"Outta the way. Move it,\
  \ you low-browed dungknuckles. You's never seen a man with no legs? Move it or I'll\
  \ bite your arse and piss on your robe.\"</p> \n    <p>Larem sighed again. Had Beetle\
  \ been drinking? Where'd he get the coin for it? </p> \n    <p>\"Kick me again and\
  \ you'll be missing some tasty toes.\"</p> \n    <p>Larem tuned one ear to listen\
  \ for any gangs or guard patrols while the other picked up Beetle's shuffling approach.\
  \ Grunts alternated with slaps of flesh on stone as Beetle swung along on his hands\
  \ until he plopped onto the mat to Larem's left. The man reeked of sour wine, and\
  \ the air about him gained an oily texture that made Larem want to scrub his face\
  \ with sackcloth.</p> \n    <p>\"Thanks for that,\" Larem said. \"We'll be lucky\
  \ if anyone gets near us for the rest of the day. What've I told you about threats?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Beetle snorted. \"They work well enough for this lot. Looking down\
  \ on me like I's dirt.\"</p> \n    <p>\"People look down on you because you don't\
  \ come above their waistlines,\" Larem said. \"You just decide to take it personally.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Bilgrew mothy woll!\"</p> \n    <p>\"Too true, Dargley. Beetle needs\
  \ to control his anger before someone runs him over with a coach.\"</p> \n    <p>Beetle\
  \ spat into the dirt. \"Let 'em try. First horse that tries to stamp me out will\
  \ get its hooves ripped off.\"</p> \n    <p>Larem couldn't hide a smile at the idea.\
  \ Once Beetle might've followed through on such a threat. Oversized shoulders and\
  \ hands had lent him a freakish strength that made him a feared fighter in their\
  \ band before...well... </p> \n    <p>Before this. Now those muscled arms only served\
  \ to drag Beetle's mangled half-a-body around Beacon's Point, hauling him from one\
  \ alehouse to another.</p> \n    <p>Beetle gargled mucus and spat again. \"Listen,\
  \ lads. I've got news.\"</p> \n    <p>Larem held his bowl out, though he knew no\
  \ one stood near enough to toss. \"I don't care which minor noble is mucking about\
  \ with which courtesan at the House of Welcome.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Shut it. Or I'll\
  \ start spreading rumors that you've got good eyes under there.\"</p> \n    <p>Larem\
  \ adjusted the blindfold covering the acid-scarred pits where his eyes used to be.\
  \ \"What's this news, then?\"</p> \n    <p>Beetle rubbed his hands, calluses scraping\
  \ like rough stone on leather. \"They found another body stuffed in a sewer drain.\
  \ Just outside the north end of Washers' Row.\"</p> \n    <p>Larem stiffened. \"\
  Same as the other three?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Ayup. Head gone. Chest split wide and\
  \ all the innards gutted.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Any clue as to the dead's identity?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"City watch was stumped, but ol' Beetle knows his rascals. It were\
  \ Tolly. He went missing from his spot down by the docks last week and I spotted\
  \ that bird tattoo on his ankle when they hauled him away—the ugly pigeon he always\
  \ loved showin' off.\"</p> \n    <p>\"It was an osprey. And if so, that's four deaths.\
  \ All victims from Rag's End.\"</p> \n    <p>Dargley pressed in close and moaned.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Larem patted his knee. \"Not to fear. Nobody would snatch you in the\
  \ middle of a crowded market.\"</p> \n    <p>Beetle cleared his throat with the\
  \ grace of a rusty hinge. \"So...what's we gonna do about it?\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Do?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Course. I ain't spouting off 'cause I love me pretty voice.\"\
  \ He dropped to a hoarse whisper. \"A fiend's loose in Magnimar—right 'ere in this\
  \ neighborhood, you betcha—and nobody dealt death to fiends like the Bloody Blade\
  \ Brothers.\"</p> \n    <p>Larem slumped. \"We aren't those men anymore. Haven't\
  \ been in a long time. There's nothing we can do but pray whoever—or whatever—is\
  \ behind the murders is dealt with quickly.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Serious?\" Beetle's\
  \ fetid breath huffed over Larem. \"It's been two months and ain't nobody got a\
  \ lead on the bastard. Not even those Caydenites what set up the new bar 'cross\
  \ the street from The Pig—and I made sure to check in with them a few times to be\
  \ sure.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I thought you were banned from there after stealing those\
  \ bottles of holy wine.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Not my fault they didn't lock the place\
  \ up nice and tight. 'Sides, who's gonna turn down a petitioner seekin' a bit of\
  \ courage to brave these dangerous streets? But all them priests are passin' out\
  \ is worthless talismans and prayers.\"</p> \n    <p>\"A cleric's protective measures\
  \ are nothing to be scoffed at.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Yeah? Look where they got us. I\
  \ mean... don't, y'know, <i>look</i>... but...\"</p> \n    <p>Larem grimaced. \"\
  I know what you mean. It doesn't change anything. We're not in any shape to confront\
  \ such a foe.\"</p> \n    <p>\"You's afraid.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I'm pragmatic.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Beetle gripped his arm hard enough to make him drop his bowl. Coins clinked\
  \ about.</p> \n    <p>\"Rag's End folks be our people now. Who's gonna protect 'em\
  \ but us? City watch don't give a spit who gets splattered, 'cept for having to\
  \ clean up the mess. Nobles figure a few beggar deaths means less on the streets.\
  \ Jaijarko and his Sczarni thugs only care if it means another gang edgin' in on\
  \ their territory.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Your point?\"</p> \n    <p>\"M'point is this\
  \ is a cause. A reason to fight!\"</p> \n    <p>\"For you, being looked at askance\
  \ is reason to fight.\"</p> \n    <p>This time the gobbet of spit struck Larem's\
  \ cheek. \"Lost your sight and lost your courage. I's shamed to squat beside you.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Beetle continued grumbling as he propped up on his hands and lugged\
  \ himself off. Larem patted the stones and dirt until he found the three copper\
  \ coins and replaced them in the bowl.</p> \n    <p>Dargley plucked at his tunic.\
  \ \"Plobbem gardley toodle?\"</p> \n    <p>Larem wiped at his grimy cheek with a\
  \ filthier sleeve. \"He'll sleep off his anger and rejoin us tomorrow.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"Smolley chargarlum?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Yes. I'm sure.\" He fished out a\
  \ coin and placed it in Dargley's hand. \"Go get yourself a hot bun. I'll meet you\
  \ by the main fountain in front of the Merchants' Guildhall in a couple hours. We're\
  \ sure to encounter a few generous souls there.\" </p> \n    <p>\"Wobbum!\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Dargley's footsteps pattered away, and Larem settled into his usual begging\
  \ routine. Odd to feel so alone within the throng of merchants, browsers, and buyers.\
  \ And why the twinge of guilt at brushing off Beetle's urgings?</p> \n    <p>Foolish\
  \ to think any of them possessed a fraction of their former skill. Foolish to believe\
  \ they could still make a difference.</p> \n    <p>When the swell of afternoon commerce\
  \ ebbed, he gathered his meager belongings. The cheap dagger he kept under his mat\
  \ got rolled up inside it. He then used the rolled mat to tap his way out of the\
  \ market, bowl outstretched as he shuffled past shops, stables, and warehouses.\
  \ He headed for Dockway, following the main road along Beacon's Point's docks. </p>\
  \ \n    <p>The salty tang of the sea briefly wiped away the stink of the dirty,\
  \ sweating crowds. Then the smell returned in force as he shuffled through one of\
  \ the area's many slums. There, the ramshackle buildings crowded closer, casting\
  \ cold shadows. Social chatter turned to mutters, whimpers, and grumbles, and the\
  \ air grew pungent with unwashed refuse.</p> \n    <p>As he passed one alley—noted\
  \ by the extra echo to his steps—several people moved to stand in his way. His rolled\
  \ mat bumped a set of shins, and he stopped, jingling the coins in his bowl while\
  \ internally bracing.</p> \n    <p>\"Pity the destitute and enjoy blessed dreams.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>The nearest man, a heavy breather who smelled of burnt oil, snatched\
  \ the bowl away and dumped the coins out. </p> \n    <p>\"You owe our master a hundred\
  \ times this,\" came his smoke-roughened voice.</p> \n    <p>Larem swallowed. \"\
  As I explained last week, Samphy, the salves didn't work. I won't pay for ineffective\
  \ remedies.\"</p> \n    <p>The flung bowl caught Larem in the forehead, and he stumbled\
  \ back a step. He resisted the urge to rub his skull, knowing weakness only encouraged\
  \ thugs to greater cruelty. </p> \n    <p>\"You calling Master Ulus a liar?\" Samphy\
  \ had perfected the art of threatening growls. To Larem, who had heard much worse\
  \ from fanged beasts as they attempted to devour him, the gang enforcer's sounded\
  \ a pale imitation.</p> \n    <p>\"I make no such claims. However, even if I were\
  \ to pay, it's only been a week since your last visit. How was I to procure funds\
  \ in such a short time?\"</p> \n    <p>The gut-punch dropped him to his knees. The\
  \ second blow cracked his head to the stones, where he lay gasping as red and yellow\
  \ explosions flashed through the darkness of his skull.</p> \n    <p>Samphy crouched\
  \ beside him. \"Master Ulus doesn't enjoy having his reputation as a healer slighted.\
  \ He also doesn't enjoy welchers. Now, I'm to collect the bill or collect a body.\
  \ I'd prefer the first, but if there's no other choice...\" He patted Larem's cheek.\
  \ \"You've got one more week.\"</p> \n    <p>One of Samphy's companions trod on\
  \ an ankle as they stepped over him, drawing a last gasp of pain before they headed\
  \ off. </p> \n    <p>Once alone, Larem felt about until he retrieved the bowl. Clutching\
  \ it and the mat—with the dagger still inside—he crawled into the nearby alley to\
  \ huddle and recover. </p> \n    <p>At least Beetle and Dargley hadn't been around.\
  \ He'd never told them how he'd squirreled away a last pouch of gold from their\
  \ adventures, then squandered it on false hope and fake healing elixirs peddled\
  \ by the local Sczarni thugs. He should've seen the con coming a long way off, even\
  \ without eyes.</p> \n    <p>Now not even hope remained.</p> \n    <p>Footsteps\
  \ approached. A single person this time. Had Samphy or one of his lackeys returned?</p>\
  \ \n    <p>He groaned as he gathered himself. \"If I didn't find payment in a week,\
  \ what will a few minutes have accomplished?\" </p> \n    <p>A rattle alerted him\
  \ to a coin tossed into his bowl. His trained ears figured it for silver. </p> \n\
  \    <p>Surprised, he raised his head and tried to fix on his unknown benefactor.\
  \ The person stood before him, a deeper zone of silence in the quiet street. Waiting\
  \ for...? Ah, of course. Larem swallowed blood and smiled crookedly.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Desna will embrace your soul, kind... sir?\"</p> \n    <p>He plucked up the offering\
  \ to bless it with a kiss. </p> \n    <p>And froze.</p> \n    <p>The pall of death\
  \ suffused the coin, an unearthly chill that iced his blood. True silver, by the\
  \ polish of it, and new enough that he easily picked out the skull engraved on either\
  \ side.</p> \n    <p>A burial coin. The type folks sometimes placed over a corpse's\
  \ eyes before it was entombed.</p> \n    <p>The presence chuckled—a liquid, putrescent\
  \ sound, accompanied by a wave of graveyard stink.</p> \n    <p>\"Hello, Larem,\"\
  \ it whispered. \"I've been looking for you.\"</p> \n    <p align=\"center\"><b>Coming\
