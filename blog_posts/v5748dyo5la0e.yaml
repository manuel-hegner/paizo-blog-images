  date\">Thursday, May 8, 2008</p> \n    <p>The <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy82t7\"><i>Pathfinder\
  \ Chronicles Gazetteer</i></a> is out now and receiving rave reviews. In case you\
  \ haven't had a chance to check it out yet, here's an excerpt of what you're missing.\
  \ I have a soft spot for Shelyn, since she was my first major contribution to the\
  \ campaign setting, so here's the first official look at her, straight from the\
  \ pages of the Gaz.</p> \n    <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderChronicles/PZO1105-Shelyn_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\" align=\"right\"> \n    <blockquote> \n     <h2>Shelyn</h2> \n   \
  \  <p><b>The Eternal Rose</b> <br>Goddess of beauty, art, love, and music <br><b>Alignment:</b>\
  \ NG <br><b>Domains:</b> Air, Charm, Good, Luck, Protection <br><b>Favored Weapon:</b>\
  \ Glaive <br><b>Centers of Worship:</b> Absalom, Galt, Sargava, Taldor <br><b>Nationality:</b>\
  \ Taldan</p> \n     <p>An ancient story tells of how Shelyn stole the glaive <i>Whisperer\
  \ of Souls</i> from her half-brother Zon-Kuthon in an attempt to redeem him. Obviously,\
  \ this didn't work, but to the intelligent weapon's great frustration, neither do\
  \ its continued attempts to corrupt or influence her. </p> \n     <p>All depictions\
  \ of Shelyn, regardless of race or ethnicity, show her as a young woman barely out\
  \ of her youth, with eyes of blue or silver. </p> \n     <p>Shelyn's ankle-length\
  \ chestnut hair bears several strands colored bright red, green, and gold. She always\
  \ wears tasteful clothing and jewelry that accentuates her beauty without revealing\
  \ too much of it. Shelyn preaches (and practices) that true beauty comes from within,\
  \ and she favors romances not based solely on lust. Clerics of Shelyn endeavor each\
  \ day to create something of beauty, whether artistically or through unconventional\
  \ forms, such as a gardener tending a flower garden.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n\
  \    <p>And, of course, because their histories tie them together, here too is the\
  \ foul Zon-Kuthon (who also appears in the upcoming <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy80i7\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder</i> #11</a>).</p> \n    <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderChronicles/PZO1105-Zon-Kuthon_120.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\" align=\"right\"> \n    <blockquote> \n     <h2>Zon-Kuthon</h2> \n\
  \     <p><b>The Midnight Lord</b> <br>God of envy, pain, darkness, and loss <br><b>Alignment:</b>\
  \ LE <br><b>Domains:</b> Darkness, Death, Destruction, Evil, Law <br><b>Favored\
  \ Weapon:</b> Spiked chain <br><b>Centers of Worship:</b> Belkzen, Cheliax, Geb,\
  \ Irrisen, Nidal, Varisia <br><b>Nationality:</b> Alien</p> \n     <p><i>The Umbral\
  \ Leaves,</i> which chronicle the history of Zon-Kuthon, claim that he was once\
  \ the half-brother of the beauty goddess Shelyn, but that his envy over her talents\
  \ led him to commit terrible acts against her and her works. For his crimes, the\
  \ gods of Golarion banished Zon-Kuthon to the Plane of Shadow, there to reside for\
  \ as long as the sun hung in the sky. Unfortunately, in the depths of the Age of\
  \ Darkness, Zon-Kuthon emerged from his prison to a benighted Golarion and wept\
  \ tears of joy. Here was a world ripe for the conquering, hidden from the light\
  \ of the stars and cloaked in fear and entropy. </p> \n     <p>Zon-Kuthon is almost\
  \ never depicted by his followers, but his presence manifests as a deep darkness\
  \ lurking in the center of paintings, and as a standing doorway that leads only\
  \ to emptiness. </p> \n     <p>The Midnight Lord wreaked terrible havoc upon the\
  \ world in the Age of Darkness, but his malign influence has mostly been purged\
  \ over the years. The lone exception to this is the Shadow Court of Pangolais, the\
  \ secret rulers of Nidal. In this dark nation, the faith of the Midnight Lord still\
  \ rules supreme, the leaders issuing edicts from their pitch-black council chambers.</p>\
