  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><b>Here’s a look behind the scenes at Paizo’s internal\
  \ playtests.</b></p> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Welcome to the second blog\
  \ following up on the recent announcement of <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sidk\"\
  >Starfinder Second Edition</a>. You can read the first blog <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sidw\"\
  >here</a>!</p> \n     <p>For those of you who don’t know me, I’m Thurston Hillman,\
  \ the Managing Creative Director for Starfinder. Basically, that means that I guide\
  \ the creative vision for the Starfinder brand, while also managing the great folks\
  \ who work on the Starfinder Roleplaying Game. Today, as we continue our open playtest\
  \ experience, I wanted to give you a behind-the-scenes look at some of the internal\
  \ playtesting we’ve been doing here at Paizo!</p> \n     <p>As a heads up, the playtests\
  \ I’m talking about here took place before our Gen Con announcement, so I’m sure\
  \ the online discourse about the new edition has already been buzzing. Sorry I can’\
  t capitalize on any memes yet.</p> \n     <p>So up until this point, the team had\
  \ been doing some immediate stress tests of new classes under the GMing stewardship\
  \ of our Director of Game Design, Jason Bulmahn. These involved some themed adventures\
  \ about a starship that went too cloze to the Horizon of an Event, or a deadly jungle\
  \ encounter where we learned the creature hunting us could bleed and so we could\
  \ kill it. The playtests we’re reviewing here take place after those, bypassing\
  \ some of our rockier initial class design, and instead focused on exploring some\
  \ other aspects of Starfinder in a new game engine.</p> \n     <h2>Playtest #2:\
  \ Blackpowder Guns in My Space Adventure?!</h2> \n     <p><strong>Map:</strong><a\
  \ href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02d7g?Starfinder-FlipMat-Drift-Crisis\">Starfinder\
  \ Flip-Mat: Drift Crisis</a><br> <b>Character Level</b>: 5th</p> \n     <p>This\
  \ second playtest, once again GM’d by myself and attended by the same group of PCs,\
  \ happened a week after the previous test and involved a SPECIAL MYSTERY GUEST.\
  \ The goal of the second playtest was to test out some issues we’d discovered in\
  \ our prior playtests. We also decided to add a guest player:</p> \n     <ul> \n\
  \      <li><strong>Gunslinger:</strong> Michael Sayre (Pathfinder Rules &amp; Lore\
  \ Manager)</li> \n     </ul> \n     <p>Yes, today’s test was to see how a Pathfinder\
  \ gunslinger (from <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq029xk?Pathfinder-Guns-Gears\"\
  >Guns &amp; Gears</a>) would operate in a Starfinder party and get a sense of the\
  \ relative playstyles and power levels. Michael was gracious enough to give us a\
  \ few hours of his time and bring in his esteemed character, Griestly Peppercorn,\
  \ a Way of the Sniper gunslinger to work alongside Jessica’s operative sniper. Also,\
  \ Griestly had heard that we were “fightin’ space fascists” and suddenly travelled\
  \ through time to help. Just normal Starfinder things.</p> \n     <p>This fight\
  \ had the PCs travelling through relatively narrow 10-foot hallways and engaging\
  \ in some medium to long-range firefights with more of the Aeon Guard. The first\
  \ encounter involved battling yet more Aeon Guard troops with laser rifles, though\
  \ this time they were supported by a hovering drone.</p> \n     <p>The players deployed\
  \ really strong tactics, with the soldier once again providing some mobile cover\
  \ and firing area weapons to suppress foes. The mystic used their Song connection\
  \ ability to provide an Inspire Courage-esque buff to the group, and the witchwarper\
  \ tossed in damage spells while using their aura to provide a speed buff to allies\
  \ starting inside their aura. The operative had some middling rolls this playtest\
  \ game, but still managed to provide long-range support in the form of consistent\
  \ damage and occasional debuffs (like a very useful clumsy condition that stacked\
  \ well with a lot of other effects going on).</p> \n     <p>Then there was the gunslinger.\
  \ I don’t know about y’all, but I think this Pathfinder game has some really powerful\
  \ classes. They might need to look at how they balance things over on that side\
  \ of the digital cubicle. \U0001f609</p> \n     <p>OK, maybe it’s just me being\
  \ a bit salty, because Michael’s gunslinger opened with a critical of 31 damage\
  \ against the Aeon Guard drone. This explosive opening was then followed by the\
  \ gunslinger using the Soldier as mobile cover to perform a covering reload and\
  \ then unleashing more shots into the drone, which quickly ended it. Then on his\
  \ next turn, a follow-up charge with a bayonet into close melee (something the operative\
  \ avoided doing as they stayed back to take long-range shots) put the gunslinger\
  \ in the thick of things and provided an opportunity to deal out a 47 damage critical\
  \ on a backshot against one of the troops. With the drone down, the remaining Aeon\
  \ Guards didn’t really stand much of a chance against the party’s onslaught.</p>\

  \ 13px;\"></p> \n     </div> \n     <br> \n     <p>That’s when I pulled out the\
  \ big guns and went right into the next encounter, with only a few rounds of rest\
  \ in-between. The next fight opened with an immense Aeon Guard robot, which trundled\
  \ down the halls and fired a line weapon that dealt 25 damage to both casters and\
  \ 50 to the soldier. For reference, our witchwarper had 36 Hit Points total, and\
  \ the soldier only had 83. Area of effect weapons will be common in Starfinder,\
  \ and positioning is going to be key.</p> \n     <p>Then Michael decided his anachronistic\
  \ gunslinger needed to crit again. Half of the robot’s health disappeared. I’m not\
  \ bitter. No, not me. Never.</p> \n     <p>At this point, the team had started reconsidering\
  \ our earlier assessment that the operative might be overtuned, based on the gunslinger’\
  s sheer damage output and ability to take multiple shots in a round—Starfinder sniper\
  \ weapons currently have an unwieldy trait that prevents repeated firing each round,\
  \ giving them the feel of really meaty single shot weapons that you want to plan\
  \ your turn around.</p> \n     <p>But then, Michael got greedy. He fired again.\
  \ He misfired. Goodbye, arquebus.</p> \n     <p>Suddenly, the whole combat dynamic\
  \ shifted as the fight became a struggle for life and death as the spellcasters\
  \ tried to work out how to best handle the robot. For reference, the Aeon Guard\
  \ robot was essentially a retooled golem statblock that replaced magic immunity\
  \ with a 40-foot line ice gun it could fire with two actions. This necessitated\
  \ some tactics of hiding in hall alcoves and positioning farther away to avoid being\
  \ hit, in the operative’s case.</p> \n     <p>After taking out the supporting Aeon\
  \ Guards, the group turned their attention to the robot, who had now cut the gunslinger\
  \ off from the others and had him in a corner. As a massive fangblade bore down\
  \ on the poor time-displaced gunslinger, my dice betrayed me, and I landed two critical\
  \ misses and a miss. This stay of execution gave the team all the time they needed\
  \ to bring their arsenal of abilities online and take the robot down with a stream\
  \ of constant (albeit resistance-reduced) damage and debuffs.</p> \n     <p>One\
  \ standout moment of the session played out a few rounds before this, as the gunslinger\
  \ took a blow from the robot and was in desperate need of healing, but the mystic’\
  s vitality network was tapped out. Luckily, the mystic had a spell just for that:\
  \ motivating ringtone. This in-testing spell currently works akin to the soothe\
  \ spell, but it plays off the mystic ringing your comm unit and causing an uplifting\
  \ tune to play that restores Hit Points and provides a save bonus as long as the\
  \ song continues. Sadly, there was one problem with this strategy for our time-travelling\
  \ friend, as Dustin soon realized and shouted, “OH NO! The gunslinger doesn’t have\
  \ a cellphone!” Again, normal Starfinder things.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \     <br> \n     <p>Our test with the gunslinger was revealing. It provided the\
  \ team more details on some of our new spells that we’d want to tweak or get tighter\
  \ verbiage on. It gave us a better look at how cover interacts with tactics in our\
  \ game, especially in those iconic hallway fights where PCs are going to use corners\
  \ and allies for impromptu cover. Finally, it let us see how the operative and gunslinger\
  \ would work together in a party. Overall, the experience went better than we hoped,\
  \ as the gunslinger felt more like a class that could spike good rolls and flirt\
  \ with danger by taking extra shots and risking misfires, while the operative was\
  \ firing single shots each round but generally putting out consistent damage without\
  \ the risk of losing their weapon—Jessica’s terrible rolls this session notwithstanding.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The team left this second playtest with lots of notes and ideas, but\
  \ overall, with a sense that these two games really can work together and provide\
  \ some fun and dynamic ways to play. On the design front, we realized new ways to\
  \ combine the strengths of tried-and-true Pathfinder mechanics and the brand new\
  \ mechanics we’re designing for this new edition of Starfinder. Thanks again to\
  \ Michael Sayre for taking a moment to jump into the future and help us perform\
  \ this outlandish playtest with a time-displaced gunslinger!</p> \n     <p>Stay\
  \ tuned to this space for more behind-the-scenes looks at our playtests, news about\
  \ our ongoing releases, and discussions about Starfinder Second Edition!</p> \n\
