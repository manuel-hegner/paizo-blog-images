  \ Enjoy!</p> \n    <h1><br>What Are the Six Trials?</h1> \n    <p>In modern times,\
  \ The Six Trials of Larazod is best known as the fictional account of a Chelish\
  \ tiefling named Larazod Rilsane. Larazod receives a vision from Asmodeus in which\
  \ the dark god unveils a prominent Chelish magistrate—the sinister Paraduke Montigny\
  \ Haanderthan—as a traitor to Cheliax, who has compacted with demonic powers and\
  \ plans to bring the worship of Asmodeus to a sharp and brutal end. Burning with\
  \ unholy justice and diabolical purpose, Larazod, along with his stalwart companions,\
  \ sets out to expose the highly placed traitor Haanderthan. They are greatly overmatched,\
  \ as Larazod is a minor scion of a piddling noble house whose influence lies tattered\
  \ in the wake of Thrune's seizure of power in Cheliax. Undaunted, Larazod vows a\
  \ smoldering blood oath to Asmodeus to see the traitor fall before Haanderthan's\
  \ actions bring the dark glory of Cheliax low.</p> \n    <p>Larazod's actions swiftly\
  \ bring him to the attention of the Paraduke, who has the young tiefling scooped\
  \ up in the crushing grasp of the law and brought before his dark tribunal for questioning.\
  \ There, a dire confrontation ensues wherein Larazod reveals his vision and heaps\
  \ accusations upon Haanderthan in full view of a well-attended tribunal session.\
  \ Outrage and scandal threaten to topple the order of things, and Larazod's enemies\
  \ grow in number. Only one high-placed member of the tribunal takes his part—a beautiful\
  \ daughter of House Sarini and rival of Haanderthan named Ilsandra. A sultry love\
  \ affair between Ilsandra and Larazod develops as the pair seeks to topple the treacherous\
  \ Haanderthan. </p> \n    <p>Haanderthan, using the awesome influence granted a\
  \ man of his stature, forces Larazod to undergo six trials to prove the truth of\
  \ his accusations, stating, \"If Asmodeus truly granted you this vision, then his\
  \ almighty black hand shall shield you from dismemberment and disembowelment in\
  \ the trials we've planned. Surely your faith does not waver?\" Larazod agrees to\
  \ the trials, blasting the magistrate with unholy oaths to see his foolish plans\
  \ undone. </p> \n    <p>The trials follow. Combat with foul beasts and grievous\
  \ tortures leaves Larazod and his companions brutally maimed both in body and soul.\
  \ At its climax, though, Larazod emerges unharmed and is vindicated as Asmodeus\
  \ himself drags the nefarious magistrate to Hell. </p> \n    <p>Despite the spectacle\
  \ and fame of this piece, perhaps the most interesting aspect of the play is that\
  \ it is rarely performed to completion. The reality of these trials in their most\
  \ lethal form—as the play's stage directions detail—prove so intense that nearly\
  \ every performance ends in the gruesome onstage death of the actors playing Larazod\
  \ and his companions, those who vow to join him in his darkest hour and face the\
  \ trials alongside him. </p> \n    <h1><br>Historical Notes on the Piece</h1> \n\
  \    <p>The writer of The Six Trials of Larazod was a legendary playwright of House\
  \ Sarini named Lokoris. Writing throughout the 4640s, Lokoris was a minor scion\
  \ of his house who rose to prominence through his gifts of the quill, and who maintained\
  \ a complete aloofness from political rhetoric or commentary in his many other successful\
  \ black comedies and heart-breaking tragedies. A signature of his style was the\
  \ combination of the comic and the serious, a hitherto unexplored mixture of human\
  \ experience in Chelish drama. Lokoris was a devout follower of Asmodeus in his\
  \ personal life, and yet his plays were known for their ability to present characters\
  \ from all walks of life and even different faiths more vividly and realistically\
  \ than his contemporaries. </p> \n    <p>The age old play known as Six Trials of\
  \ Larazod was considered an outrageous piece, even more so after Lokoris’s revisions\
  \ to the classic—wherein Larazod, a common man, defies the will of a corrupt magistrate.\
  \ Rewriting this classic plot into both a violent celebration and sideways denouncement\
  \ of the new Chelish regime, Lokoris transformed it into one of the most avant-garde\
  \ and sadistic plays in the country’s history. In its time one performance caused\
  \ widespread riots throughout the city of Westcrown. Lokoris was soon revealed as\
  \ the playwright, not only ending his career but resulting in his disappearance.\
  \ He was never found or heard from again, but common theory holds he was swept up\
  \ by agents of House Thrune and his soul consigned to some bleak corner of Hell\
  \ for all eternity—an ironic twist of life imitating art. </p> \n    <p>The play\
  \ was banned for over 50 years then revived by a later troupe, whose playing of\
  \ the piece in the outer regional theatres of Cheliax met with great success (though\
  \ they went through actors quickly as the trials devoured a few each night). However,\
  \ as the play began to pick up traction among larger and more respectable troupes,\
  \ the play proved untenable once more. A production by a highly regarded troupe\
  \ in Egorian resulted in the audience storming the stage and tearing apart the actors\
  \ playing both Larazod and Haanderthan. </p> \n    <p>Since, the play is oft discussed\
  \ in drama academies and among the well-read elite of Cheliax but has never received\
  \ a serious staging. Until now. </p> \n    <h1><br>The Three Larazods</h1> \n  \
  \  <p>There have been several restagings of Lokoris’s The Six Trials of Larazod\
  \ in the last dozen years, but these have been from a much adapted and markedly\
  \ less lethal text bearing more in common with the original, centuries old text.\
  \ Finding a \"Lokoris version” or a classic “Original Larazod” now is not easy,\
  \ but texts arise from time to time. As such, audiences attending the play often\
  \ don't know from which text the actors will be performing, with those expecting\
  \ a night of theater instead finding themselves attending a bloodbath and visa versa.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>In the modern readaption, as in the original, Tybain merely serves as\
  \ comic relief (even most Lokoris versions cut many of his blasphemous musings on\
  \ Aroden's power and what not). Additionally, the entire endgame of the plot is\
  \ often reworked, and the character of Ilsandra much changed. In this revision,\
  \ Ilsandra is a succubus who delivers a false vision onto Larazod to urge the youth\
  \ to topple Montigny Haanderthan—in this version vindicated as a true patriot, falsely\
  \ accused through abyssal treachery. Therein, Ilsandra is the real culprit, Larazod\
  \ the flawed tragic hero, and Haanderthan a true believer in Asmodeus under false\
  \ accusation. Obviously, this reading of the play is far more palatable to most\
  \ nobles' sensibilities and on occasion receives patronage and stagings. The Lokoris\
  \ version, while deadlier and far more of a spectacle, sees a tiefling triumphing\
  \ over one of the rulers of the land and seems to encourage defiance against the\
  \ aristocracy—features that, regardless of the villain's corruption, do not sit\
  \ well with the noblesse. </p> \n    <h1><br>Dramatis Personae</h1> \n    <p>Being\
  \ those to face damnation and torments most foul amid the Six-Fold Trial. </p>\n\
  \    <p><b>LARAZOD RILSANE</b>: A tiefling at a time when being a tiefling isn't\
  \ easy. To most Chelaxians, tieflings are considered a distasteful mixing of pure\
  \ bloodlines and diabolic influences based not on thoughtful and potent compacts\
  \ and bargains, but rather a crude relationship and mere carnal episode bearing\
  \ rotten fruit. Larazod is a low-ranking scion of a lesser house and has no real\
  \ influence. He achieved nominal acclaim as an officer in the Everwar but has never\
  \ really been recognized as a hero. He is an odd choice for Asmodeus's messenger,\
  \ but his faith in the Dark Lord is peerless and unquestioning. He is a simple and\
  \ low-ranking member of society who is chosen nonetheless by Asmodeus to right a\
  \ terrible wrong through faith alone.</p> \n    <p><b>DENTRIS MALAGRADA</b>: An\
  \ old, cantankerous wizard and a retainer in Larazod's family for as long as anyone\
  \ can remember. He has forgotten more about magic than most wizards ever knew. While\
  \ his magic is rusty, his mind is otherwise sharp, and his rapier wit cuts down\
  \ most foes before violence is even an option in their mind. As snarly and grumpy\
  \ as he is, he loves Larazod like a son, and though he tries to talk the zealous\
  \ youth out of his dire course of action several times, he still marches steadfastly\
  \ into death and dismemberment with his tiefling master once his sound advice is\
  \ ignored. He is the character who most often moves audiences to tears, and his\
  \ death during the trials often leaves no dry eye in the house.</p> \n    <p><b>TYBAIN\
  \ OBEISAN</b>: A paladin of Aroden who is drawn to close kinship with Larazod not\
  \ by common religion, but rather by the mutual power of their faith in their own\
  \ respective gods. The religious discourse between these two characters in the original\
  \ manuscript illuminates just how close faiths can be, even when diametrically opposed.\
  \ Tybain serves mostly as comic relief in this play, though theorists claim his\
  \ original purpose was far more dramatically interesting, and meant to serve as\
  \ insightful religious and political commentary. However, most of this was cut in\
  \ staged adaptations for obvious reasons, and only the comic bits involving this\
  \ character remain. The actor cast as Tybain traditionally dies first in the Trials\
  \ and usually to audience applause.</p> \n    <p><b>ILSANDRA</b>: The diabolic daughter\
  \ of House Sarini who falls in torrid lust/love with Larazod. Whether or not Ilsandra\
  \ really loves the young soldier turned tyrant-toppler is a topic of much heated\
  \ debate among noteworthy drama critics. Many insist she is just using the boy to\
  \ take down her rival. Either way, no one can deny her canny, Machiavellian mind\
  \ and demure use of both her charms and wiles to come out on top in the play's conclusion\
  \ (whether Larazod survives or not).</p> \n    <p><b>DROVALID VORCLUNE</b>: Para\
  \ Inquisitor of the Tribunal, a deeply pious giant of a man whose flesh is one long\
  \ taut veneer of scar tissue. He is a self-flagellant whose zealous love of his\
  \ duties as head torturer is matched only by his zealous belief in Asmodeus's will.\
  \ Assigned to administer soul-rending tortures to Larazod, the giant is converted\
  \ by the tiefling's unyielding devotion to his beliefs and decides to assist the\
  \ unlikely prophet through the remainder of his trials.</p> \n    <p><b>MONTIGNY\
  \ HAANDERTHAN</b>: The sadistic, traitorous, and demon-corrupted paraduke of Cheliax\
  \ who engineers and oversees Larazod's trials. Arrogant and self-serving, he uses\
  \ his lofty station in an attempt to deflect Larazod's accusations and put an end\
  \ to both his accuser and his political rivals. His fate is decided, though, as\
  \ soon as he defies Asmodeus's chosen servant.</p> \n    <p><b>BAILFF</b>: The left\
  \ hand and herald of magistrate Haanderthan. This nameless servant of the court\
  \ introduces the feared paraduke and speaks no more, though his ominous presence\
  \ lingers throughout the trial.</p> \n    <p><b>THE PRINCE OF DARKNESS</b>: The\
  \ archfiend and lord of Hell himself, whose hand shields Larazod throughout his\
  \ trials and who ultimately exacts his own judgment upon both the accused and the\
  \ accuser.</p> \n    <br clear=\"all\"> \n    <p>Wes Schneider<br> Managing Editor</p>\
