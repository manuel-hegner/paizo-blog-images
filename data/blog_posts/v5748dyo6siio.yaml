  >fortune dragon</a> last time. This time things are a little different. You’ll see\
  \ what I mean once I start to tell you about the horned dragon. Let’s have a look!</p>\n\

  \      <p>One of the challenges with the update to the Second Edition remastered\
  \ rules was having to leave a lot of old favorites behind. In addition to classic\
  \ spells, notable magic items, and other memorable mechanics, we also had to leave\
  \ behind some monsters. Unfortunately, in some cases, a variety of reasons makes\
  \ leaving behind strigiform-ursine hybrids or cuboid gels the best option for us.\
  \ There are other cases where a bit of cleaning up and a makeover leads to something\
  \ we can still use in the new remastered environment. That’s the approach we took\
  \ with the horned dragon—a dragon who you might previously remember for its focus\
  \ on the color green.</p>\n      <p>Horned dragons are our second primal dragon\
  \ offering in <em>Monster Core</em>. Like other primal dragons, horned dragons are\
  \ powerful and more bestial than other dragons. This manifests most notably in the\
  \ form of their massive, paired horns. In addition to simply striking others with\
  \ their horns, a horned dragon charges their prey and impales these unfortunate\
  \ victims on the horn. Once impaled, the prey is stuck and goes wherever the dragon\
  \ goes until the prey manages to escape impalement.</p>\n      <p>Beyond that, the\
  \ horned dragon should feel relatively familiar. Their personalities are relatively\
  \ the same, their other abilities such as their poison breath and twisting tail\
  \ reaction are still around, and they still generally live in forested regions and\
  \ swamps. When updating monsters for the remaster, we wanted to make these changes\
  \ as unintrusive as possible and allow updated monsters to generally fill the same\
  \ role they had prior to their update.</p>\n      <p>We also took these opportunities\
  \ to update monsters in interesting ways where we could, thus the shift from the\
  \ dragon’s color to their horn and the addition of their impaling charge. The change\
  \ in focus allows us to make the dragon more of our own and even opens them for\
  \ future possibilities. While the horned dragon in <em>Monster Core</em> is green\
  \ and lives in forests, there’s a decent chance you could see a blue horned dragon\
  \ that lives in a lake or a tan horned dragon that lives in a desert sometime in\
  \ the future!</p>\n      <p>That’s our look at the horned dragon! Make sure to keep\
  \ an eye out for this dragon and lots of other new dragons when <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02ej4?Pathfinder-Monster-Core\"\
  ><em>Monster Core</em></a> releases in March. Stay tuned for more draconic previews\
  \ in the coming weeks. Next time, we’ll take a look at the majestic empyreal dragons.\
  \ See you then!</p>\n      <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold; line-height:\
