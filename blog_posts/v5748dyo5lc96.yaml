  \ Robin D. Laws</p> \n  <h2>Chapter Two: The Hole</h2> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>\
  \ On massive, clawed legs, the forest-beast bounds toward the elves and their captives.\
  \ Its beady eyes, shielded by rootlike extrusions, seem to lock onto Gad. It stops\
  \ to snort and paw the ground. </p> \n   <p>Gad can't help but wonder: why him?</p>\
  \ \n   <p>It can't be that he's the only human present. There are two in the press-gang\
  \ now.</p> \n   <p>Then he understands: he's bruised and limping from the thrashing\
  \ Ethundel gave him. He reads as the weakest prey.</p> \n   <p>Dualal's lesser subordinates\
  \ pose for flight. Ethundel preempts them, sweeping his sword from the imposing\
  \ scabbard mounted on his back. \"For you, milady!\" he bellows. Meadow-grass churning\
  \ beneath his boots, he runs for the forest-beast. It shifts its attention to the\
  \ shouting warrior. It charges. Ethundel stands ready to pivot when it reaches him,\
  \ but misjudges its speed. It butts him full-on. His wiry body flies into the air.\
  \ He lands with a thud. The creature, spraying leafy sputum, rears to crush him\
  \ beneath elephantine feet.</p> \n   <p>Ethundel rolls, seizes the hilt of his dropped\
  \ sword, and stabs up into the beast's scaly belly. Gouts of pulpy blood gush from\
  \ the wound. The elf reaches to withdraw his stuck blade. The creature bucks away\
  \ before he can grasp it. Ethundel pulls out a dagger.</p> \n   <p>Finally shocked\
  \ from their daze, his comrades rush with drawn longswords to join him. </p> \n\
  \   <p>Dualal remains in place. She reaches for the spiraled wand strapped to her\
  \ back. Green energy swirls up the spirals to collect around its globular tip. With\
  \ a snap of her wrist, Dualal lobs the gathered energy into the air. It arcs onto\
  \ the creature's back.</p> \n   <p>The beast freezes in mid-leap. Its position insupportable,\
  \ it thumps over on its side. Dualal calmly ambles over to it.</p> \n   <p>The elves\
  \ have left Gad and the second prisoner on their own.</p> \n   <p>\"Let's go,\"\
  \ the young man says.</p> \n   <p>Gad shakes his head. \"They'll catch up,\" he\
  \ says, words muffled by the gag.</p> \n   <p>The creature isn't breathing. The\
  \ wand's magic has stilled even its involuntary reactions. Dualal, impassive, watches\
  \ it suffocate. Even in death it remains rigid.</p> \n   <p>\"She wouldn't use that\
  \ on us, would she?\" the prisoner asks.</p> \n   <p>Gad points to his mouth, as\
  \ if to say, <i>I can't answer, I'm wearing a gag</i>.</p> \n   <p></p>\n   <center>\n\
  \    ∗ ∗ ∗\n   </center>\n   <p></p> \n   <p>For several hours Ethundel leads the\
  \ party deeper into the wildwood. Signs of corruption grow ever more frequent. The\
  \ ground cover becomes a slick fungal mass. Blackened spores swell the surfaces\
  \ of rocks and boulders. Bloated insects the color of corpse-flesh hang like bats\
  \ from withered branches.</p> \n   <p>Clustering firs give way to an expanse strewn\
  \ with vine-choked logs. These thin out as the group trudges into a vast circle\
  \ of dead vegetation. Diffuse smoke rises from a fire ahead. Temporary shelters,\
  \ fastidiously constructed from scrap wood, huddle on the edge of a pit. On its\
  \ lip, elven archers—Gad counts three of them and assumes there will be more—stand\
  \ with exaggerated ease. Their weapons point down into the hole.</p> \n   <p>Ethundel\
  \ seizes Gad by the back of the neck and shoves him onward. He hisses into Gad's\
  \ ear, his breath hot and vaguely sweet. \"Here's where you learn humility, churl.\"\
  </p> \n   <p>The pit has been quarried from an earthy soil thick with chunks of\
  \ shattered limestone. Ethundel manhandles Gad toward its edge. A treacherous ramp\
  \ composed of loose gravel leads down into the pit. Ethundel means to steer Gad\
  \ short of it, to heave him directly into the hole. It's a fifteen, maybe twenty-foot\
  \ drop.</p> \n   <p>\"Good Ethundel!\" Dualal warns. Ethundel snarls, changes course,\
  \ and jostles Gad onto the ramp. The prisoner stumbles, recovers, and slides down\
  \ to its floor level without twisting an ankle. He contemplates the connection between\
  \ the elf leader and her chief bullyboy. Not lovers, he decides: It's the wrong\
  \ kind of heat. It smacks more of an unbidden, unexamined mother-son pull. Perhaps\
  \ between a mother who has never had a son and a son who has never known his mother.\
  \ Gad stores the theory for later use.</p> \n   <p>He surveys his new surroundings.\
  \ Dried meal coats the side of an empty gruel-pot. Heaps of dirt and gravel periodically\
  \ shed their pebbles. Planks of fresh-cut deadwood cover a deeper hole in the pit's\
  \ center.</p> \n   <p>A dozen prisoners sit in exhausted stupor on hard-packed dirt.\
  \ Shackles bind their ankles. They are pale, undernourished, water-starved. Eleven\
  \ humans, three of them women, and a female halfling. Gad gives himself a plausible\
  \ interval, and checks to see that none of his captors are looking, before seating\
  \ himself next to the latter.</p> \n   <p>It hurts to see her in this state. Under\
  \ chosen circumstances, Vitta would be impeccably turned out. No matter how deep\
  \ the dungeon, she'd be powdered and rouged, her clothing spotless, her hair piled\
  \ and secured by an intricate copper lattice. Grime coats her forehead. Her usually\
  \ plump cheeks have sunk. </p> \n   <p>\"You all right?\" he asks.</p> \n   <p>She\
  \ stares ahead, speaking without moving her lips. \"Remind me again why I got volunteered\
  \ to get caught first.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Your expertise in matters subterranean. Your\
  \ mastery of traps, engineering, hazards...\"</p> \n   <p>\"An annoyingly correct\
  \ answer.\"</p> \n   <p>\"They've been putting you to work?\"</p> \n   <p>\"Also\
  \ remind me, once this rip is over, to never lift another rock.\" She steals a sideways\
  \ glance. \"You got kicked around some, too.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Got to sell the gaffle.\"\

  \ She lifts a flat, chalky stone. Beneath it lies a torn rag tied into a bundle.\
  \ Vitta pats it, eliciting the telltale sound of cut gems rubbing up against each\
  \ other. \"Rubies. Found them down in the works. Behind a locked panel no one else\
  \ saw.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Dualal naturally insists that all swag is turned over to\
  \ her, to disperse as she deems fit.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Naturally. You've got that\
  \ look.\"</p> \n   <p>\"What look?\"</p> \n   <p>\"That look that says we're not\
  \ going to get to keep these.\" Vitta replaces the stone.</p> \n   <p>\"We're here\
  \ for the big steal.\"</p> \n   <p>\"This little steal could feed a village for\
  \ a year.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Not that you'd use it for that.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Who would?\"\
  </p> \n   <p>His expression kept safely flat, Gad laughs.</p> \n   <p>\"Bad tidings,\"\
  \ Vitta says, shifting her eye-line to guide Gad's gaze.</p> \n   <p>Ethundel has\
  \ taken aside one of the humans. Unlike the others, this man wears no shackles.\
  \ He towers above the elf warrior, outweighing him by fifty pounds of muscle. He's\
  \ all jaw and naked cranium, framing a pinched and narrow face. The elf speaks into\
  \ his cauliflowered ear. He nods obediently.</p> \n   <p>\"That's Stokh,\" says\
  \ Vitta.</p> \n   <p>\"Let me guess. Jailhouse stooge.\"</p> \n   <p>\"There's always\
  \ one,\" says Vitta.</p> \n   <p>\"Ethundel has taken a dislike to me.\"</p> \n\
  \   <p>\"Inexplicable.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Looks like I'll have to watch my back.\"\
  </p> \n   <p>\"So nothing new, then.\"</p> \n   <p>Stokh breaks from Ethundel. He\
  \ attempts to be subtle as he assesses Gad.</p> \n   <p>\"Better break for a while.\"\
  </p> \n   <p>Vitta hobbles away from him. Half an hour later, when the elven guards\
  \ are inattentive, they drift back together. </p> \n   <p>\"Want the breakdown on\
  \ the complex?\"</p> \n   <p>\"Sure,\" says Gad.</p> \n   <p>\"Two thousand years\
  \ old, give or take. Definitely elven. Not purpose-built, but a reuse of an existing\
  \ structure. The room forms are organic. Shaped as if the roots of a gigantic tree\
  \ withdrew to somewhere else, leaving behind a hollow. It's all wood and earth,\
  \ eternally suspended in a state between dead plank and living plant.\"</p> \n \
  \  <p>\"What did they use it for? The elves who built it, or grew it, or whatever?\"\
  </p> \n   <p>\"Originally? Vaults. Probably a treasury and armory. Quite a full\
  \ one, judging by the size of the place. There's royal crests everywhere.\"</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"Whose crests?\"</p> \n   <p>\"Am I an expert on the heraldry of second-millennium\
  \ backwoods elven royalty? You should have brought Calliard.\"</p> \n   <p>\"He's\
  \ not to be found. And yes, I also hate small-team rips. But there's a limit to\
  \ the number of captures we could believably fake.\"</p> \n   <p>\"I'm complaining,\
  \ not re-airing the plan,\" says Vitta. \"At any rate, the complex. Maybe sometime\
  \ after it was first excavated, it became a shelter for noncombatants in a time\
  \ of war.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Something has to be going badly, for elves to live belowground.\"\
  </p> \n   <p>\"That's understatement for you. And then its last use: Like we thought,\
  \ a prison. To keep something in, and to prevent any bunch of later fools from letting\
  \ it out. Once they had it sealed in, they laid in a gaggle of impressive traps\
  \ and filled the whole thing up with rocks and dirt.\"</p> \n   <p>\"You figure\
  \ they got the plants to do that for them, too?\"</p> \n   <p>\"No, they did it\
  \ by hand. Whatever's in there, they truly wanted it to stay.\" </p> \n   <p>\"\
  And you reckon it did?\"</p> \n   <p>\"If it got out, it was through tons of tightly\
  \ packed debris, not to mention some very impressive traps.\"</p> \n   <p>\"So preferably,\
  \ we steer well clear of it.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Preferably,\" says Vitta.</p> \n  \
  \ <p></p>\n   <center>\n    ∗ ∗ ∗\n   </center>\n   <p></p> \n   <p>In the morning\
  \ they are roused with sword-butts. Elven guards kick them until they stand. They\
  \ remove the prisoners' shackles, clanking them into a heap. The longer-held captives\
  \ know what to do: they pull the boards from the hole within the hole.</p> \n  \
  \ <p>\"Down you go,\" the amber-headed elf commands. </p> \n   <p>The prisoners\
  \ form a queue. One by one they descend into a shaft, climbing with the aid of precarious\
  \ spikes thrust into stone and root. </p> \n   <p>\"We want to be near the front,\"\
  \ Vitta tells Gad. </p> \n   <p>He edges in, with Vitta right behind him. The others\
  \ are happy to give him his berth. The forward part of the job is evidently the\
  \ hardest and most hazardous.</p> \n   <p>Stokh sees him and pushes his way into\
  \ the line, too. The wretched captives seem surprised. Gad guesses that he doesn't\
  \ generally take point.</p> \n   <p>The shaft takes them twenty feet down, where\
  \ it meets a narrow tunnel. Metal buckets line the passage. </p> \n   <p>Stokh shoulders\
  \ Gad into the rocky wall. He presses, pinning him there. \"You're not going to\
  \ cause trouble here.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Why do you care?\" Gad demands.</p> \n   <p>Stokh\
  \ stinks of brandy, a provision not granted the other prisoners. \"We're nearly\
  \ there. Then the elves let us go. Safe. Don't you ruin it.\"</p> \n   <p>Before\
  \ Gad can reply, Stokh storms down to the head of the procession.</p> \n   <p>Ethundel\
  \ is up ahead. </p> \n   <p>Gad strides up behind Stokh. He waits. Then speaks:\
  \ \"Hey, bald-head. What liberties do you allow the elves, in trade for that brandywine?\"\
  </p> \n   <p>At first Stokh is too shocked to move. He recovers, turns, and swings\
  \ a knobby fist. Gad ducks. He pushes into the bigger man. Stokh grabs him and shoves,\
  \ pushing Gad into Ethundel. The elf withdraws, stiffening in revulsion.</p> \n\
  \   <p>\"Cease this now, louse-ridden scum!\"</p> \n   <p>Gad slips past to catch\
  \ up with Vitta.</p> \n   <p>Stokh's outraged breathing fills the passageway.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>The tunnel jogs to bypass a formation of hard quartz. Vitta grabs Gad\
  \ by the back of the tunic. He stops short before brushing a section of quartz slathered\
  \ in a wet, gluey substance. Above it juts a copper spout, now stuffed with rags.\
  \ A man's corpse, mummified by the glue, adheres to the rock.</p> \n   <p>\"Glue\
  \ trap,\" says Vitta.</p> \n   <p>\"I can see that,\" says Gad.</p> \n   <p>The\
  \ passageway abruptly ends. Its rough terminal wall grants room for four laborers\
  \ to have at it with pick-axes. Vitta takes an axe for herself, and hands another\
  \ to Gad.</p> \n   <p>\"Welcome to the hole,\" she says.</p> \n   <p>They dig, freeing\
  \ stones, releasing cascades of dry soil. Other prisoners scurry up to gather the\
  \ debris into buckets. They send it brigading down the passageway, each bucket passed\
  \ from hand to hand.</p> \n   <p>They toil until they're dizzy and ready to drop.\
  \ Their captors dole out miserly portions of water and gruel. When workers waver,\
  \ the swordpoints come out.</p> \n   <p>By the time they're allowed to stumble from\
  \ the excavation, night has fallen. Gad staggers to the wall of the outer pit and\
  \ collapses. Sleep takes him immediately.</p> \n   <p>When he awakens, it is with\
  \ Stokh's steely fingers around his windpipe.</p> \n   <br> \n   <p><b>Coming Next\
