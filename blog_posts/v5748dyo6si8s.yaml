  \ \n     <br> \n     <p>It's a new creative team, a new party of Iconics, new lands\
  \ of Golarion to explore, and unforgettable moments galore in the brand-new adventure.\
  \ Paizo and Dynamite are teaming up once more to offer not only a thrilling tale,\
  \ but also extra features that players can bring right to their next game nights!\
  \ It's been nearly five years since the last major <em>Pathfinder</em> saga in comics,\
  \ the critically acclaimed Spiral of Bones from writer Crystal Frasier. Since then,\
  \ the world of Pathfinder in-game and in real world popularity has exploded even\
  \ more. With recent record-smashing sales of sourcebooks and more, it's the perfect\
  \ time for fans of the game to experience this classic alternate avenue of adventure!</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"I'm thrilled to be back writing <em>Pathfinder</em> comics, and even\
  \ more exciting to be writing a whole new party of Iconics meeting and adventuring\
  \ together for the very first time,\" said writer Fred Van Lente.</p> \n     <div\

  \ <br> \n     <p> In <em>Wake the Dead</em>, the tantalizing prospect of a rendezvous\
  \ with a Gebbite defector in possession of priceless secrets from that undead nation\
  \ draws together a diverse group of adventurers in the Nexian metropolis of Ecanus.\
  \ Van Lente has assembled an all-new party, spotlighting Iconics who, before now,\
  \ have only graced the four-colored pages as guest stars. Readers will get to hang\
  \ out with Quinn the investigator, Sajan the monk, Lem the bard, and Seelah the\
  \ champion, while readers of the original hit series by writer Jim Zub and others\
  \ get reacquainted with Harsk the dwarf ranger! When they all find themselves cornered\
  \ by the city's remorseless Deathsealers, can the Iconics band together for survival\
  \ and escape a city full of hostile wizards alive? </p> \n     <p>Fred Van Lente\
  \ has been playing tabletop RPGs for years, going back to the classic \"red box\"\
  \ basic sets, which he received as a kid like many his age. Eventually, he was introduced\
  \ to the world of <em>Pathfinder</em> and played regularly for years. Recently,\
  \ he wrote the epic comic spotlighting Fumbus the alchemist, available initially\
  \ on Kickstarter. He's been contributing prose stories to the mythos on the Paizo\
  \ site for a while too. Beyond the world of roleplaying, Van Lente is beloved for\
  \ his work on hallmark comics titles like <em>Amazing Spider-Man</em>, <em>Incredible\
  \ Hercules</em>, <em>Marvel Zombies</em>, <em>Archer &amp; Armstrong</em>, <em>The\
  \ Comic Book History of Comics</em>, and more.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ is joined by artist Eman Casallos, who will bring his dungeon master-esque storytelling\
  \ to the page. Artists Steve Ellis and Biago d'Alessandro also contribute covers\
  \ to issues, in addition to Casallos. d'Allesandro's covers for each issue of the\
  \ series will also connect to form a larger image when collected together.</p> \n\
  \     <p>Each issue of <em>Pathfinder: Wake the Dead</em> features premium cardstock\
  \ covers, making a top tier product for collectors and something durable that will\
  \ survive the rigors of the gaming table. Issues also come with bonus material useful\
  \ for players of the game. These will include playable character stats for the iconic\
  \ paladin Seelah, new character options for inhabitants of the magical military\
  \ city of Ecanus, and more. And all of these extra features are officially sanctioned\
  \ by the <a href=\"\">Pathfinder Society</a>!</p> \n     <p>Paizo and tabletop fans\
  \ can stay tuned too, as the first ever <em>Starfinder</em> comic series is right\
  \ around the corner too! More information about that series will be revealed soon!</p>\
