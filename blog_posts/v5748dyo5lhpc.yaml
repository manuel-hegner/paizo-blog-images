  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Saturday, July 11, 2015</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"\
  > \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Whenever there is a new patch for <a href=\"\
  http://goblinworks.com\" target=\"_blank\">Pathfinder Online</a>, it's like being\
  \ a kid in a candy store, or getting the new rulebook with that class you've been\
  \ dying to play! New options that expand the game are really fun to play around\
  \ with <i>and</i> they have the benefit of changing things up enough to make it\
  \ interesting. The tenth patch for Pathfinder Online (lovingly referred to as EE10)\
  \ brings a bunch of new stuff into the game!</p> \n    <h2>I Used a Mule... and\
  \ I Like It!</h2> \n    <p>In a game which simulates a real-world economy, moving\
  \ resources and finished goods from one side of the map to the other without help\
  \ is a daunting and time-consuming task. Even a character optimized for hauling\
  \ heavy loads can carry only a small amount of something heavy like iron ore or\
  \ coal, not to mention the bulk resources that settlements need to grow and become\
  \ more advanced.</p> \n    <p>Enter the mule, the ornery equine whose ability to\
  \ haul heavy loads is legendary. In EE10, players will be able to hire mules to\
  \ help them carry heavy loads across the map. Either buy a set of saddlebags from\
  \ the auction house, or craft a set with your leatherworker character, then proceed\
  \ to the muleteer adjacent to the bank to get your own friendly mule for six hours!\
  \ The mule will follow you around like a puppy dog... as long as you don't go too\
  \ fast and leave him in the dust. If you do, he will sit down on his hind legs and\
  \ pout until you come back into range, at which time he will leap up and run to\
  \ you with a happy grin on his face.</p> \n    <p>When left for more than a minute\
  \ though, the mule will no longer be attached to you. Once a mule becomes unattached,\
  \ anybody (including you) can come up to him and acquire him, at which point he\
  \ will happily follow his new owner around. So you'll want to get back to him quickly.\
  \ If the mule isn't acquired by anyone within 15 minutes, it will die from loneliness\
  \ and leave a husk that can be looted in the next half hour. After that time, whatever's\
  \ left in the husk goes away for good.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n \

  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderOnline/20150711-LaurethoronMule_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br><i>Laurethoron hires a mule at the bank before heading out.</i>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>While playing around with my new mule friend, I found that\
  \ he worked great for gathering resources. As you go around gathering, he will dutifully\
  \ follow you and allow you to dump the stuff you find onto him for the first four\
  \ hours that you have him. (For the last two hours, you may only remove goods from\
  \ your mule.) This means that you can effectively stay out gathering for hours without\
  \ having to spend a bunch of time running back to town every time you become too\
  \ encumbered.</p> \n    <p>The downside to the mule, though, is that a bandit who\
  \ sees a mule is going to (probably correctly) assume that there's profit to be\
  \ had by taking your mule. Doing so will give them a reputation hit unless you are\
  \ being feuded by them (attacking a mule is the same as attacking you for reputation\
  \ loss), but the gains could outweigh that penalty. On the other hand, the mule\
  \ is almost always slower than a running human, especially when loaded down with\
  \ stuff. So if the bandit takes the mule for himself, he'll have to make a slow\
  \ getaway, giving you a chance to bring some friends in to hunt him down. A bandit\
  \ who wants to run off will have to take only what he can carry, leaving the mule\
  \ for you to reacquire, minus a few choice pieces of your stash.</p> \n    <p>The\
  \ mule is definitely a game changer in a virtual world where goods are regionalized\
  \ and bank vaults aren't global. I can't wait to see how it shakes out!</p> \n \
  \   <h2>I Fought Nhur Athemon... and I Won!</h2> \n    <p>The other big feature\
  \ coming this weekend is the first server-wide event, the Wrath of Nhur Athemon.\
  \ As I mentioned in last week's blog, this event is centered around the removal\
  \ of the towers that have dotted the landscape in our War of the Towers mini-game.\
  \ But now their time is done; Nhur Athemon has other uses for them.</p> \n    <p>Testing\
  \ the escalation, four of us decked out in Tier 2 gear with a bunch of expendables\
  \ such as potions and greater tokens, and set out to free a hex from Nhur Athemon's\
  \ influence. I don't want to give too many spoilers, but beating this escalation\
  \ is all about finishing off the various quests, not killing the monsters that defend\
  \ the hex (though sometimes those two things will align). The minions of Nhur Athemon\
  \ had some tasty loot on them—some of the best I had seen in the game to date! Tier\
  \ 2 and even Tier 3 recipes, spells, and maneuvers dropped into our greedy hands.\
  \ There were even a handful of the new recipes for creating settlement buildings—\
  things folks are going to really want come early August when you'll be able to start\
  \ building your own settlements from scratch!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderOnline/20150711-LaurethoronNhurathemon.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderOnline/20150711-LaurethoronNhurathemon_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br><i>Laurethoron battles Nhur Athemon one on one.</i>\n    </div>\
  \ \n    <p>This escalation event also unveiled the first of the new Azlanti crystals,\
  \ Pathfinder Online's twist on Pathfinder RPG's ioun stones. Everybody who participates\
  \ in beating down the escalation gets a crystal for their efforts. Crystals have\
  \ their own slot on your character and we plan to introduce different crystals in\
  \ future monthly events. Eventually, you'll be able to take lesser Azlanti crystals\
  \ and craft them into much more powerful versions.</p> \n    <p>Of course, befitting\
  \ all the great loot, Nhur Athemon turned out to be the deadliest escalation that\
  \ we had faced to date. Between the four of us–a heavily armored melee fighter,\
  \ a ranged fighter, a cleric, and a wizard—we died 22 times over the course of the\
  \ escalation. We got better at fighting Nhur Athemon as we went along, so I expect\
  \ that we will have slightly less deaths the next time we face off against him,\
  \ though his minions are nevertheless deadly. With the right mix of potions and\
  \ spells, you can give yourself an advantage, but it will take trial and error (and\
  \ a few deaths in the process) to figure this out. And in the end, Nhur Athemon\
  \ and his hoodlums are still going to give you a fierce battle. What fun!</p> \n\
  \    <p>For newer players, we have made The Shadow of Nhur Athemon, an easier version\
  \ of this event that will appear in certain hexes. With some +2 Tier 1 feats and\
  \ some spells and potions, you will have a tough fight on your hands. This escalation\
  \ doesn't drop the high-end loot that the main one does, but it will give new players\
  \ some nice things to play around with in the game, including the Azlanti crystal\
  \ drop.</p> \n    <h2>Player Spotlight: Jokken</h2> \n    <p>I met Jokken as part\
  \ of the leadership of Stoneroot Glade and the Coal Road Alliance. At the start\
  \ of the game, he and his allies were hampered by being isolated in the northwest\
  \ corner of the map, away from all the action. Rather than letting that become a\
  \ negative, he and his compatriots in the northwest have managed to create a thriving\
  \ haven for characters interested in dealing with some of the NPC challenges in\
  \ PVE far away from the PVP drama happening in the southeast part of the map. Now\
  \ they are one of the fastest-growing areas of Pathfinder Online. Let's hear from\
  \ Jokken himself about how this all came about:</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>I\
  \ love Pathfinder Online. It touches core aspects of my interests and life as few\
  \ other things do: Fantasy tabletop RPGs, Online Multi-User Dungeons, and a vibrant,\
  \ evolving community. Like many of my peers, I came upon fantasy roleplaying with\
  \ the classic D&amp;D \"red box\" in the mid-1980s. Thanks to Mr. Mentzer, I still\
  \ desperately want to punch that Bargle fellow in the nose. That grudge and the\
  \ stirring art of Larry Elmore gave birth to a passionate obsession that has lasted\
  \ 30 years. What started in my friend's basement as ten-year-old children rolling\
  \ dice for hours upon end, slaying caves full of trolls and bears for magic and\
  \ plunder, evolved into the rich 12-hour-a-week tabletop gaming experience I enjoy\
  \ today.</p> \n     <p>My love for Paizo began with <em>Dragon</em> Magazine. Along\
  \ with Neil Gaiman's \"Sandman\" comic and Robert Jordan's \"Wheel of Time\" series,\
  \ <em>Dragon</em> and <em>Dungeon</em> were the cornerstone of my adolescent escape\
  \ experience. Grabbing those magazines from my local bookstore each month and poring\
  \ over them cover-to-cover brought joy that is completely untranslatable to adult\
  \ life. Given my endearment of such works, my weekly group and I were on board with\
  \ the launch of Pathfinder RPG Alpha, running the entirety of the Second Darkness\
  \ Adventure Path under that system. Since then, our multiple weekly gaming sessions\
  \ have been filled with adventure paths, Pathfinder Society scenarios, and mythic\
  \ homebrew. With a diversified pot of interests, I'm a 3-star Pathfinder Society\
  \ GM and, along with my dear friend venture-captain Eric Clingenpeel, I organize\
  \ an annual convention hosted in a winery/brewery. (If you're in the Mid-Michigan\
  \ area at the end of August, join us at <a href=\"https://www.warhorn.net/events/tavern-con-2015\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Tavern Con 2015</a>!)</p> \n     <p>When not rolling dice, working,\
  \ or volunteering on community projects, I'm playing MMOs. That experience began\
  \ in the days of yore when I'd log my Packard Bell 486/66 machine onto a much younger\
  \ internet and get lost in text-based MUDs such as GemStone III and Tarmon Gai'don.\
  \ One can not thank TinyMUD enough for turning a floundering middle-school typist\
  \ into a keyboardist extraordinaire. Games like Asheron's Call and EverQuest came\
  \ calling in the '90s along with an eventual transition to a seven-year experience\
  \ in World of Warcraft.</p> \n     <p>By the end of 2013, my interest there had\
  \ lost its steam. The glory of the theme park MMO was waning. That's when the Pathfinder\
  \ Online Tech Demo Kickstarter hit my radar. After reading all I could on the burgeoning\
  \ product, I wanted it and I wanted it now. When the second Kickstarter came along\
  \ I got a chance to vote with my wallet and help to make this dream come to be.\
  \ I didn't have the bankroll to become an alpha backer, but last August I was very\
  \ pleased to buy access to Early Enrollment and begin my life in the River Kingdoms.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Those early days were simply the best. I still miss clobbering goblins\
  \ with the flat side of my axe and tussling with the \"Werewolf of Rathglen.\" The\
  \ experience of interacting with a game world that evolves and changes 24/7 is impossibly\
  \ enticing. Many of the friendships garnered in those early days of development\
  \ are the seeds of the community to come.</p> \n     <p>With January and the launch\
  \ of Early Enrollment, we hit the ground running. We had pledged to life in the\
  \ west and became enamored with the ideal of living on the frontier. With no handouts\
  \ or guidance from an alpha aristocracy, we are a people on the range with nothing\
  \ but bootstraps and grit. The bonds of our Alpha experience held our little cadre\
  \ together. We are Stoneroot Glade, Talonguard, and Tavernhold, and we are here\
  \ to stay. We slowly built what we have from the salted earth up, and did it without\
  \ a training manual. It is tedious and painful at times, but endlessly rewarding.\
  \ In lockstep, we embraced \"hard is fun.\"</p> \n     <p>There were so many awesome\
  \ days the first couple of months. In week one, we kitted out in starter gear and\
  \ hastily crafted +1's and set ourselves upon a wild and dangerous wilderness. We'd\
  \ do crazy things, like spend a 5-hour evening tussling with Moloch Cultists, nervously\
  \ ferrying coin and the occasional piece of Tier 2 loot back to the bank as a break\
  \ from being roasted alive. Gutgluts (a tribe of goblin ghouls) were a numerous\
  \ mainstay. We endeavored without end to push them back around Guardheim and away\
  \ from our lands. I was stunned not just by those undead fiends but also at the\
  \ resolve of my companions. I think the pinnacle of our grit in the Tier 1 days\
  \ was clearing out a Ripping Chains goblin tribe at the full 26,000 strength with\
  \ four unrelenting souls, a pile of gear, and a free weekend. Making a safe place\
  \ for new recruits is important to us. It came from the blood, sweat, and tears\
  \ of the dedicated.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderOnline/20150711-Jokken.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n      <br><i>Jokken and his Stoneroot Glade compatriots rest at one of their\
  \ shrines.</i>\n     </div> \n     <p>We decided early that we'd be a free people.\
  \ Freedom and brotherhood became the cry of the western settler. We looked at the\
  \ collectivist play going on in the east and put it at our backs. We would be a\
  \ collection of engaged clans, a tribe of diversifying interests with constructive\
  \ gameplay at its heart. We have a lot of sand in the western sandbox, and our desire\
  \ to pile it up is ravenous. We advance through hard work and fair trade. Meritocracy\
  \ has become the way of the west. We're a land where everyone is born a slobbering\
  \ infant and worth is built on one's ambition and resolve.</p> \n     <p>Looking\
  \ at the community growing across the map, we saw the Empire of Xellias focusing\
  \ on an engaging and exciting PvP-centric experience, the Free Highlanders fighting\
  \ for justice and glory in the north, and the Everbloom Alliance churning the cogs\
  \ to manufacture an industrial complex and great civilization in the southeast.\
  \ \"Where do we fit?,\" we pondered. Largely, we inherited the role of player-versus-environment\
  \ by necessity. We were a small band of settlers compared to the rest of the server,\
  \ with five escalation sources and three monster home hexes in our region. We would\
  \ either forge ourselves into the most skilled and efficient force tackling those\
  \ threats, or we would die trying. To that end, we did both spectacularly. We do\
  \ not like being overrun by infected hexes, therefore, by force of will we do not\
  \ get overrun. Molochs, Ustalavs, Mordant Spire, and Elemental invasions meet our\
  \ mettle and are no more. One can walk from Talonguard to Tavernhold and have little\
  \ to fear.</p> \n     <p>Our latest (and perhaps proudest) endeavor is the creation\
  \ of the Coal Road: a bridge between east and west; a lifeline of communication\
  \ over the distance between our kingdoms. The Coal Road is a physical thing, much\
  \ like the Silk Road of Marco Polo fame. It stretches from Forgeholm and Blackfeather\
  \ Keep at the edge of the Eastern lands, into the Southern Echo Peaks, through depot\
  \ stops in Callambea and Alderwag, into the Western Echo Woods, before coming into\
  \ the heart of our society in the Bulwark Hills, connecting Tavernhold to Stoneroot\
  \ Glade and Talonguard, then turning South to a cozy tavern on the Highwater Plains.\
  \ It is a conveyance from east to west and back again; a path for those of brave\
  \ heart and bold endeavors to journey and seek their self-made futures and fortunes.\
  \ It is also a fantastic <a href=\"http://coalroad.com/\" target=\"_blank\">online\
  \ resource</a>, a place for citizens across the River Kingdoms to communicate and\
  \ trade with the peoples of the west; an open channel of diplomacy where new relationships\
  \ can be fostered and new trade opportunities found. In either incarnation, all\
  \ who are respectful of their neighbor are welcome to join the Coal Road. Its stones\
  \ come from the ore of our land, the mortar, the triumph and tears of our ambitions.\
  \ We hope you like it.</p> \n     <p>The future holds limitless possibility that\
  \ none can predict. Even our seers of Desna and Pharasma are silent on the subject,\
  \ but I, as many, look forward to meeting it head on.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n\
