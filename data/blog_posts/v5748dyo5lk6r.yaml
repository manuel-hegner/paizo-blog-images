  \     </div> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Eh? Is that you, girl? It's about\
  \ time! I have a blasted archive to run, and I can't lollygag all day in some café\
  \ waiting for a single customer! I'm Gloamont Sanderson, genealogist to kings! I\
  \ don't care if I was the one who insisted on meeting here. My time is valuable!</p>\
  \ \n     <p>And this? Your family? This is the kind of trouble I don't want walking\
  \ through my front door. So thank you for that.</p> \n     <p>So you want to know\
  \ about your mother, and unlike those cheapskate sorcerers you had the coin to cover\
  \ my considerably expenses. Well, it's been six weeks and have I got bad news for\
  \ you.</p> \n     <p>I found her.</p> \n     <p>But before we reach deep inside\
  \ this squirming sack of ettercrap I've opened, let's take a step back. There I\
  \ was, handsome shopkeep that I was, minding my little business when a healthy young\
  \ woman walks in with coin in her purse and mud on her boots. That combination means\
  \ one thing: Adventurer. And adventurers mean trouble. You get yourselves mixed\
  \ up in drama and intrigue and five-generation curses and then you come to me to\
  \ dig up the dirt on your behalf. Last adventurer I took work from wanted me to\
  \ research his \"friend's\" grandparents, so he could travel back in time and murder\
  \ some evil overlord none of us have even heard of yet!</p> \n     <p>That can't\
  \ be healthy.</p> \n     <p>But all you want is to meet your mom. Gave me a sob\
  \ story about never feelin' like you belong anywhere, but girl, no teenager feels\
  \ like they belong anywhere. But you're persistent. I hate persistence. And so I\
  \ take the job before I notice your blue eyes. Not very common among garundi. I\
  \ thought to myself, maybe mom's an Ulfen lass sailing south, and your daddy couldn't\
  \ fess up to a little foreign indiscretion. I'd be remiss if I didn't admit to a\
  \ certain fondness for family gossip. It's what makes me so good at my job.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>But no. No Ulfen on any passenger manifests in or out of Botosami near\
  \ the time of your birth. Not many passengers at all—storms kept 'em away. Unseasonable\
  \ storms. Your mother's storms.</p> \n     <p>Your mother is Panrael, the Thunder\
  \ of the Jagged Reach. A storm hag. A nasty one, too, by all accounts. Vengeful,\
  \ cunning, short-tempered, possessive. Persistent. Yeah.</p> \n     <p>You're a\
  \ \"changeling,\" a \"virga may\" if you want it a little honey to wash that vinegar\
  \ down. And don't shake your head at me, because I may be irritable and arrogant\
  \ but I'm never wrong. Hag blood runs in your veins; old magic from places people\
  \ never walk. I don't care if you've never cast a spell in your life, when you're\
  \ mama gets ahold of you, she'll tear away every trace of humanity and decency that\
  \ keeps it bottled up, and you'll be like her. They're like cuckoos, leaving their\
  \ eggs with some other fool bird to raise, and once you're ripe they come back to\
  \ pluck you... and I, I lost that bird metaphor along the way. Apologies.</p> \n\

  ></a> \n      <p><i>Illustrations by Ken Hamilton</i></p>\n     </div> \n     <p>You\
  \ understand, though, that you are in great danger, yes? And by proximity, so am\
  \ I! I obtained your half-sister's folio in an auction selling all her belongings\
  \ after she wandered out into the rain one night and never returned. She had also\
  \ been researching Panrael; assembled extensive notes not just your mother, but\
  \ hags and what they're capable of. I'm not a paranoid man, but your mother almost\
  \ certainly has already called to her and transformed her, and that means now there\
  \ are now two storm hags on your scent, and two storm hags who likely know I bought\
  \ this folio!</p> \n     <p>And hags hate each other, especially mama and daughter!\
  \ If there's two of them, that means they want three to make a coven. A coven means\
  \ power, and power is the only thing hags love more than they hate. With a little\
  \ training they can tap that bond for more magic, meaner spells, perform rituals\
  \ to make spies or jinxes or curse a family for five generations! <i>My family line\
  \ is impeccable and does not need a curse, thank you quite plainly!</i></p> \n \
  \    <p>Your best bet is to do like me and find yourself a witch. I know, wizards\
  \ seem educated and sorcerers seem powerful and you'd think a cleric would be ideal\
  \ for repelling ancient evil, but hags don't give one whit about mortal gods. They\
  \ worship power, and hags and witches draw from the same primeval font. Hell, some\
  \ witches get their power by way of a hag, but you don't want to go to one of those.\
  \ A witch can outwit a hag, because they're at least a little bit hag themselves.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Yes, even boy witches. Do you want to nitpick or do you want advice?</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Kids these days.</p> \n     <p>Find yourself a nice vellemancer, they're\
  \ wish-granters. Not as buff as an efreeti, but also a lot less likely to enslave\
  \ you for a thousand mortal lifetimes. That doesn't work, look up an arakineticist—\
  they throw curse magic around like hags do, and some of 'em can even turn that kind\
  \ of magic back on a source. There are witch-hunters, too, like hexbreakers and\
  \ malice binders, but I don't know how they'd take to a half-hag girl knocking at\
  \ their door. If you're particularly vindictive, track down a hag-riven; they're\
  \ changelings like you, but they escaped their mothers before they could be turned\
  \ all hag. They're mean, and bloodthirsty, and want someone to take out all that\
  \ misplaced aggression on. Great buncha ladies.</p> \n     <p>Now get out, and stay\
  \ away from the woods. And the coast! Take the folio, too; I'm not giving your family\
  \ any other reason to come looking for me! You're the third changeling I've worked\
  \ up a genealogy for, and it never ends well. No one should see the inside of a\
  \ stewpot more than once in a lifetime.</p> \n     <p>Crystal Frasier<br> <i>Developer</i></p>\
