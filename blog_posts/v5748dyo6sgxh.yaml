  \ World Guide</a> can help answer things like “Where are you from?” and “Where are\
  \ you going?,” I think that the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01zt4?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Character-Guide\"\
  >Lost Omens Character Guide</a> tries to help answer an even more critical question:\
  \ “Who are you?” The Character Guide offers great information on <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgut?Such-a-Lovely-Place-Such-a-Lovely-Face\"\
  >ethnicities</a> for our core ancestries and even new ancestries to choose from!\
  \ However, there’s more to your character than your ancestry. Almost as important\
  \ as your ancestry is the people you know and with whom you associate. Are you a\
  \ member of the local guard or thieves’ guild? Did you join up with your nation’\
  s army? Are you part of a doomsday cult or a church of an obscure deity? </p> \n\

  \      </div> \n      <p>The organization or organizations you join can have just\
  \ as an important role in your character’s life as their class or ancestry. Because\
  \ of this, we wanted the Character Guide to also take a look at some of the notable\
  \ organizations in the Inner Sea region. This includes obvious groups like the Pathfinder\
  \ Society, but also organizations that have had less time in the spotlight over\
  \ the years like the Magaambya Academy. For the Character Guide, we landed on five\
  \ spots for major organizations which include the Hellknights (lawful), Knights\
  \ of Lastwall (lawful good), Magaambya Academy (neutral good), and the Pathfinder\
  \ Society (neutral). After we decided on these four, we realized that chaotic characters\
  \ didn’t really have an obvious group to join. Some back and forth happened and\
  \ eventually I pitched an idea for a brand new organization and thus, the Firebrands\
  \ were born. (If you missed it, we even had a preview of their shenanigans with\
  \ some <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgwc?Tales-of-Lost-Omens-Bad-Dogs\"\
  >fiction</a> by Chris A. Jackson a few weeks back!)</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ by Michele Esposito</p> \n      </div> \n      <p>Who are the Firebrands? Depends\
  \ on who you ask! Some people say they are rebels and rabble rousers who travel\
  \ the Inner Sea region to fight tyranny and help the oppressed. Others say that\
  \ they are just grandstanders with a penchant for fashion and drawing attention\
  \ to themselves. In a way, they’re both right. The Firebrands began life as rebels\
  \ when the people of Vidrian reached out to the people of Ravounel in an act of\
  \ solidarity shortly after the founding of both new nations. In the process, the\
  \ Vidric rebels and the Silver Ravens met up and realized that they both still had\
  \ that rebellious fire and wanted to join up and continue fighting oppression. Eventually\
  \ word of these first Firebrands got out and, in an attempt to ask for their aid,\
  \ some rebels in Galt publicly declared themselves as Firebrands. While not officially\
  \ part of the original group, these Firebrands had that same fighting spirit and\
  \ others believed them to be part of the organization, too.</p> \n      <div class=\"\

  \  </div> \n      <p>This leads to more and more people declaring themselves Firebrands\
  \ and things getting out of hand. Eventually, some Free Captains do it to stick\
  \ it to the man, which in turn becomes a trend among others. This fad of “joining”\
  \ the Firebrands escalates to a whole movement of people doing so for the thrill\
  \ of going around and doing daredevil acts and having fun. These Firebrands in turn\
  \ draw lots of attention away from the rebellious side of the group and then we\
  \ have the Firebrands of today. If you’re playing a Firebrand, you might choose\
  \ to go in on the fun and gaudy lifestyle, drawing throngs of people to hear about\
  \ your latest exploit. In that case, you might end up taking the Entourage skill\
  \ feat.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190913-entourage.png\"\

  \ and maintaining an entourage takes a lot of work. In fact, only the most well-known\
  \ Firebrands have the popularity to draw large groups of people. If you’re not popular\
  \ enough yet, maybe it’s time to go and delve another ancient ruin or wear some\
  \ more eye-catching clothing! You can always head to the Vaunter’s Carnival—a yearly\

  \ Firebrands as a mask to go around and help those in need. Maybe putting on a persona\
  \ is still too much. In that case, the Firebrands are also perfect at helping you\
  \ remain anonymous, as anyone can join the group. In fact, the Firebrands make use\
  \ of gear to keep their deeds hidden like the <i>insistent door knocker</i>, the\
  \ <i>unmemorable mantle</i>, and one of my favorite first edition items, <i>snapleaf</i>!</p>\

  \ feather fall and a 2nd-level invisibility spell for 1 minute or until you stop\
  \ falling, whichever comes first.\"></a> \n      </div> \n      <p>Many of the options\
  \ featured in the organizations section of the Character Guide are uncommon or rarer\
  \ options. Some of these, like the <i>snapleaf</i> above, are widespread enough\
  \ that you can acquire them even without a connection to the organization. For those\
  \ that are less common, it’s generally a simple matter of joining up with the organization.\
  \ Each section features details on how to join these groups, allowing GMs and players\
  \ to work together to get characters membership as their respective stories allow.\
  \ For the Firebrands, it’s actually a simple process: go somewhere that has a lot\
  \ of people and publicly declare yourself a Firebrand. You did it! You’re a first\
  \ mark Firebrand! Moving up in the ranks is a bit tougher than that, though. You\
  \ have to gain a reputation and eventually have to have a recognized second mark\
  \ Firebrand officially accept you as a Firebrand. Once this happens, you have become\
  \ a second mark and gain access to most of the section’s rules options, including\
  \ the new Firebrand braggart archetype!</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\

  \ boasting and trying to do as many death-defying deeds as possible, placing your\
  \ reputation on the line in the process. Firebrand braggarts can make big boasts\
  \ about something they’re about to do, such as a Long Jump over a chasm, and if\
  \ they succeed, gain a bonus to other Long Jump checks for a while as they ride\
  \ high on their success. If they fail, however, they take a penalty to further checks\
  \ for some time as their bruised ego recovers. Later feats allow braggarts to taunt\
  \ their foes to trick them into letting their guard down, do fun stunts that let\
  \ them dance around the battlefield, and even defy death by their sheer determination\
  \ alone. The Firebrand braggart archetype is a double-length archetype taking up\
  \ two pages and the Firebrand Braggart Dedication feat is available starting at\
  \ 4th level.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190913-daringact.png\"\
