  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Hazards are some of the most\
  \ common challenges in Pathfinder, apart from monsters, and the most common hazards\
  \ are traps. Most of the hazards in the Pathfinder Playtest are traps, but there\
  \ are also environmental hazards like mold and quicksand, or even haunts. Rather\
  \ than have different rules for each type of hazard, in the playtest, hazards all\
  \ have a unified format, though how you might find them and deal with them can be\
  \ quite different.</p> \n    <h2>Noticing a Hazard</h2> \n    <p>Most hazards can\
  \ be noticed using Perception, although simple or obvious magical hazards are easily\
  \ noticeable via <i>detect magic </i>and similar magic. Some hazards are so easy\
  \ to locate that you might notice them even if you aren't even searching. Other\
  \ hazards might be created or hidden in a particularly devious way and require a\
  \ certain proficiency rank to notice them before it's too late, even if you're searching.\
  \ (The rogue's Trap Finder feat improves this even further in the case of traps,\
  \ but any character with legendary Perception can find any Perception-based hazard—\
  not just rogues!) These harder-to-locate hazards don't appear until higher levels,\
  \ since it's incredibly unlikely to encounter a level 1 trap created by a legendary\
  \ crafter, though that doesn't mean all high-level hazards are hard to notice. For\
  \ instance, the most dangerous example hazard below, the Armageddon Orb, is trivial\
  \ for almost anyone to notice.</p> \n    <h2>Disabling a Hazard</h2> \n    <p>The\
  \ skill needed to disable a hazard varies. Traps are usually disabled via Thievery,\
  \ environmental hazards via Nature or Survival, and haunts via Occultism or Religion,\
  \ though there are exceptions in every category. Many hazards require a certain\
  \ number of successes before they are fully disabled, and a critical success typically\
  \ counts as two successes. A critical failure means you've accidentally triggered\
  \ the hazard! Many physical hazards can also be destroyed by brute force. In many\
  \ cases, breaking the trigger mechanism might set the trap off prematurely, which\
  \ you might be able to do from a safe distance. We felt it was really important\
  \ to make dealing with hazards a more narrative experience without taking lots of\
  \ extra time or requiring the GM to make up details on the spot, and so every skill\
  \ that can be used to disable a hazard is listed in the stat block, along with a\
  \ description of the how a PC would use that skill to do so.</p> \n    <h2>Simple\
  \ or Complex?</h2> \n    <p>Out of everything in the playtest, hazards may be the\
  \ one component for which you can get the best preview right now. How? Starfinder.\
  \ We had already created an early framework for hazards by the time Starfinder came\
  \ around, so when I was asked to create a framework for Starfinder's traps, I adapted\
  \ what we had for the Pathfinder Playtest, and the rest of the <a href=\"/products/btpy9qy1\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em></a> team liked what they saw. We've refined the\
  \ playtest's system since then, which means that we have two main types of hazards:\
  \ simple hazards that trigger, take their reaction, and are then done, and complex\
  \ hazards that roll into initiative and shift the game into encounter mode until\
  \ the PCs deal with them (or at least escape).</p> \n    <h2>For Example…</h2> \n\
  \    <p>Let's take a look at several sample hazards!</p> \n    <blockquote> \n \
  \    <p class=\"stat-block-title\">Hidden Pit <span class=\"stat-block-cr\">Hazard\
  \ 0</span></p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">Mechanical, Trap</p> \n     <p class=\"\
  stat-block-1\"><b>Stealth</b> DC 16</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Description</b>\
  \ A trapdoor covers a 10-foot-square pit that is 20 feet deep.</p> \n     <p class=\"\
  stat-block-1\"><b>Disable</b> Thievery DC 12 to remove the trapdoor, making the\
  \ trap no longer hidden (Perception DC 0 to notice)</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"\
  ><b>AC</b> 10, <b>TAC</b> 7; <b>Fort</b> +1, <b>Ref</b> +1</p> \n     <p class=\"\
  stat-block-1\"><b>Hardness</b> 4 (trapdoor); <b>Immunities</b> critical hits, object\
  \ immunities, precision damage</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">[[R]] <b>Pitfall</b></p>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Trigger</b> A creature walks onto the trapdoor.</p>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Effect</b> The triggering creature falls in\
  \ and takes falling damage (typically 10 bludgeoning damage). That creature can\
  \ use the Grab Edge reaction to avoid falling.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"\
  ><b>Reset</b> The trap still causes falling damage if anyone falls in, but the trapdoor\
  \ must be reset manually for the trap to become hidden again.</p> \n    </blockquote>\
  \ \n    <p>Ah, the pit, the most basic of all simple traps. Anybody can find a hidden\
  \ pit, even if they aren't searching for it, because the Stealth DC doesn't require\
  \ a proficiency rank. If someone walks onto the trapdoor, the pit uses its reaction\
  \ to open up, and the triggering creature might fall. The Disable entry explains\
  \ how a character can pop the trapdoor off and make the pit obvious to all. Still\
  \ might want to be careful crossing, though!</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p class=\"\
  stat-block-title\">Armageddon Orb <span class=\"stat-block-cr\">Hazard 23</span></p>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">Magical, Trap</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"\
  ><b>Stealth</b> DC 10 or <i>detect magic</i></p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"\
  ><b>Description</b> A roiling red orb, forged from a drop of Rovagug's blood, rains\
  \ fire from the sky when a specified condition is met.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"\
  ><b>Disable</b> Thievery DC 51 (legendary) to imbue thieves' tools with aspects\
  \ representing Asmodeus and Sarenrae and use them to drain away the orb's power\
  \ over 10 minutes, taking 5 fire damage each round during that time</p> \n     <p\
  \ class=\"stat-block-1\">[[R]] <b>Burn It All</b> (divine, evocation, fire)</p>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Trigger</b> A special condition set by the\
  \ trap's creator, typically on the event of her death.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"\
  ><b>Effect</b> Fire rains from the sky in a 100-mile radius, dealing 10d6 fire damage\
  \ to creatures and objects in the area (Reflex DC 46 for half damage, or no damage\
  \ on a critical success). Any creature reduced to 0 Hit Points in this way dies\
  \ instantly. This is not enough damage to completely burn away a forest or level\
  \ a mountain or city, but it typically kills most creatures in the area.</p> \n\
  \    </blockquote> \n    <p>This one was pure, over-the-top fun to write. What would\
  \ a level 23 hazard even look like? This one is really obvious but incredibly difficult\
  \ to disable. The effect's damage is not even remotely a threat to high-level PCs—\
  but if they care about any NPCs in the region, chances are they're not going to\
  \ want to set this thing off!</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-title\"\
  >Bloodthirsty Urge <span class=\"stat-block-cr\">Hazard 10</span></p> \n     <p\
  \ class=\"stat-block-1\">Haunt</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Stealth</b>\
  \ DC 29 (trained)</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Description</b> An object\
  \ imbued with echoes of a vicious mind tries to kill someone who comes near.</p>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Disable</b> Religion DC 27 (master) to exorcise\
  \ the spirit or Diplomacy DC 29 (expert) to talk it down</p> \n     <p class=\"\
  stat-block-1\">[[R]] <b>Quietus</b> (emotion, fear, illusion, mental, occult)</p>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Trigger</b> A creature moves within 10 feet\
  \ of the haunted object.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Effect</b> The\
  \ haunt takes control of the triggering creature, forcing it to attack itself. The\
  \ creature is affected by <i>phantasmal killer</i> (DC 25), except that instead\
  \ of mental damage, the damage type is based on a weapon the creature has drawn,\
  \ an object it holds, or its unarmed attack damage if it's holding nothing.</p>\
  \ \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Here's an example of a haunt. As you can see, it\
  \ uses the same basic framework as the other hazards, so once you learn the rules,\
  \ you can use them flexibly for almost any hazard you can dream up! In this case,\
  \ a PC could use Religion to exorcise the haunt, but a character could also potentially\
  \ use Diplomacy to talk it down. Still, the master of Religion has the advantage\
  \ with an easier DC. You could even imagine an adventure where it matters how the\
  \ PCs deal with a hazard. Perhaps exorcising a haunt using Religion helps sanctify\
  \ the area, while using Diplomacy might persuade the spirit to impart some hints\
  \ to the PCs about what happened before it departs.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n  \
  \   <p class=\"stat-block-title\">Spinning Blade Pillar <span class=\"stat-block-cr\"\
  >Hazard 4</span></p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">Complex, Mechanical, Trap</p>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Stealth</b> +10 (trained) or DC 24 (expert)\
  \ to notice the control panel</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Description</b>\
  \ A metal pole with three razor-sharp spinning blades is hidden in the floor, connected\
  \ to trigger plates in up to eight floor tiles and a hidden control panel within\
  \ 30 feet.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Disable</b> Thievery DC 18 (trained)\
  \ twice on the pillar, or Thievery DC 16 (expert) once on the control panel deactivates\
  \ the entire trap</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>AC</b> 19, <b>TAC</b>\
  \ 15; <b>Fort</b> +6, <b>Ref</b> +10</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Hardness</b>\
  \ 11 (2 dents) on the pillar, denting the panel causes the trap to stay constantly\
  \ active and prevents disabling the panel; <b>Immunities</b> critical hits, object\
  \ immunities, precision damage</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">[[R]] <b>Rising\
  \ Pillar</b> (attack)</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Trigger</b> A creature\
  \ steps on one of the floor tiles.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Effect</b>\
  \ The trap pops up in a grid intersection and makes a spinning blade attack against\
  \ one adjacent creature (if any), then rolls initiative.</p> \n     <p class=\"\
  stat-block-1\"><b>Routine</b> (3 actions) On its initiative, the trap spends its\
  \ first action making a spinning blade attack against each adjacent creature, its\
  \ second action to move straight in a random direction (roll 1d4 to determine the\
  \ direction), and its third action to attack each adjacent creature. This trap doesn't\
  \ take a multiple attack penalty.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Speed</b>\
  \ 10 ft.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">[[A]] <b>Melee</b> spinning blade\
  \ +12, <b>Damage</b> 2d10+5 slashing</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Reset</b>\
  \ The trap deactivates and resets after 1 minute.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n   \
  \ <p>This is the first complex trap ever created for the game. It was also responsible\
  \ for the first death in the game, as Logan kept rolling randomly for the blade's\
  \ movement, which just happened to be wherever Stephen's rogue had moved while trying\
  \ to avoid it—and then it rolled right back over him after he fell unconscious.\
  \ Note that the complex trap has a Stealth bonus, rather than just a DC, since it\
  \ actually rolls for initiative in encounter mode (using Stealth). If your party\
  \ has an expert in Thievery who can find the hidden panel (we didn't; our expert\
  \ lay bleeding on the ground), this hazard is actually a breeze to disable, but\
  \ even a trained character can disable it with patience, and a not-so-patient character\
  \ can always smash it apart with enough big hits to deal 11 or more damage.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>So what do you think? Care to hazard an opinion?</p> \n    <p>Mark Seifter<br>\
