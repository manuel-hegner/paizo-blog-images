  \ to write for some of my favorite ancestries – aasimar and orcs in <em>Lost Omens\
  \ Ancestry Guide</em>. I’ve been a freelancing TTRPG writer for a little over two\
  \ years and loving every moment. I’ve written for previous Lost Omens books, the\
  \ PFS adventure (1-22) <em>The Doom of Cassomir</em> and several adventures for\
  \ the subscription service Dungeon in a Box. I hosted and ran the actual-play and\
  \ GM discussion podcast Mythos Manual, which post-modern plague may actually get\
  \ back to. I work in television production and live in Los Angeles with my cat,\
  \ dog and fiancé. Follow me on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CaDavidCalder\"\

  \ Catalan and I wrote androids and azarketi for <em>Lost Omens Ancestry Guide</em>.\
  \ I’ve been freelancing for Paizo’s Pathfinder and Starfinder RPGs for nearly two\
  \ years. In that time I’ve contributed to twenty three projects for Paizo (and counting!),\
  \ including <em>Advanced Player’s Guide</em>, <em>Lost Omens Legends</em>, <em>Starship\
  \ Operations Manual</em>, <em>Alien Archive 4</em>, five Organized Play scenarios,\
  \ and a variety of other products that will release over the next year or so. In\
  \ between freelancing and parenting, I occasionally find time to update <e href=\"\

  \ Hey, everyone! I’m Lyz Liddell, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lyzmaytweet/status/1296135733208465408?s=20\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">former</a> designer and editor for Pathfinder, back on the job\
  \ to nurture my beautiful goth children: dhampirs! When I created this versatile\
  \ lineage for the Advanced Player’s Guide, there was so much more we wanted to do\
  \ than we had space for, so it was a delight to put those ideas into action for\
  \ the Lost Omens Ancestry Guide. Dhampirs in fiction bear an unfortunate and long-held\
  \ association with violence and loss, but I wanted to break those assumptions in\
  \ Pathfinder so you have the freedom to tell any stories you want with these physically,\
  \ socially, and emotionally complex characters. I hope you enjoy them!\n      <p></p>\
  \ \n      <br> \n      <h3>Ron Lundeen</h3> \n      <p>I’m Ron Lundeen, a developer\
  \ on the Pathfinder Adventure Path line here at Paizo. I really wanted to write\
  \ up the fleshwarps for this book, because they could be tentacled and gross. I\
  \ initially thought of them only as grotesque creations for players who want to\
  \ be a monster (which their ancestry feats really reflect), but as I thought about\
  \ fleshwarps' place in the world, I realized that even these physically distinct\
  \ people would have conventions, hopes, goals, and self-images of their own. Incorporating\
  \ these thoughts made them a much deeper and more flavorful ancestry. With a fleshwarp,\
  \ you can still \"just be the monster,\" or you can explore what it means to have\
  \ a shockingly inhuman appearance in a world of wonders and terrors. Plus, Gaping\
  \ Flesh is maybe my favorite feat I've ever written. You can check out my RPG advice,\
  \ including an entire free Pathfinder Second Edition Adventure Path I wrote, on\

  s been a thrill contributing articles to <em>Pathfinder Adventure Path</em>(most\
  \ recently “Prisons of the Inner Sea”) and several Pathfinder 2e hardcovers. <em>Lost\

  \ \n      <br> \n      <h3>Andrew Mullen</h3> \n      <p>Hello from the US Southwest!\
  \ I'm Andrew Mullen, who you might know from Old-Mage Jatembe's section of Lost\
  \ Omens Legends and xulgath culture in the Extinction Curse Adventure Path. For\
  \ Lost Omens Ancestry Guide, I worked on fetchlings and aphorites. I've always liked\
  \ shadows' place in fantasy, but as someone who doesn't play much with the chaos/law\
  \ axis, aphorites were a new challenge. I quite enjoyed thinking through what it\
  \ means to have an intrinsic connection to order!<br> Ancestries aside, and assuming\
  \ this blog presents authors in alphabetical order by last name, I'm going to scoop\
  \ Mikhail's bit - we're working on a third-party project!<br> Was the world plunged\
  \ into darkness because the prior civilization exsanguinated god to death, and when\
  \ his eyes closed the stars went out? Was it because the wreckage of the gods' civil\
  \ war blotted out the sky? In <em>Ourichor: Fulcrum of the Luminant Age</em>, there's\
  \ no certain answer: this truth is a matter of faith. The Luminant Age is a Weird\
  \ Fantasy world with a robust, nuanced take on fictional culture. But that level\
  \ of detail doesn't mean an impenetrable mess of lore! We want players to be able\
  \ to dive right into a game, even one that takes into account the power struggles\
  \ and intrigues of a technological renaissance fueled by god's blood.<br> Oh, and\
  \ we've got vampire anteater dogs and flying rays with gardens on their backs! Adorable!<br>\

  \ читатели! (Hello, dear readers!) My name is Mikhail Sergeyevich Rekun, and you\
  \ may remember me from <em>Lost Omen Legends</em> (Baba Yaga) PFS 1-15 <em>Blooming\
  \ Catastrophe</em>, and PFS 2-8 Frosty Mug, amongst a great deal of other writing.\
  \ In my significantly more boring daily existence, I’m a Russian-American historian\
  \ and educator, presently working in China.<br> In <em>LOAG</em>, I wrote the entries\
  \ for the tieflings and the duskwalkers. Duskwalkers and I go way back—my very first\
  \ assignment for Paizo was writing Duskwalker feats for the <em>Plane-Hopper’s Handbook</em>,\
  \ and my first ‘big’ Paizo assignment was the <em>Half-Dead</em> backmatter in AP139\
  \ <em>The Dead Roads</em>.<br> Here and today, though, I want to mention a new project\
  \ I’m working on, a bit outside of the Paizo umbrella. <em>Ourichor: Fulcrum of\
  \ the Luminant Age</em> is an upcoming third-party setting for Pathfinder Second\
  \ Edition, a Weird Fantasy Swashbuckler set in a world without stars, where players\
  \ will have a chance to set the course of history—or maybe just get run over by\
  \ it, as the case may be.<br> It’s still early days, but we have a Twitter at <a\
  \ href=\"https://twitter.com/LuminantA\" target=\"_blank\">https://twitter.com/LuminantA</a>\

  \ adventures. This book is also a major milestone for me: my 50th contribution to\
  \ Paizo's catalog! Although I'm best-known as a writer for Paizo's various lines,\
  \ I also develop rules and write new content for other clients including Petersen\
  \ Games, Raging Swan Press, AAW Games, Legendary Games, and a dozen more using rules\
  \ for Pathfinder (both editions), Starfinder, and D&amp;D. This time, I'm excited\
  \ to revisit catfolk and provide them with some new tricks! I previously wrote some\
  \ of their <em>Inner sea Races</em> mechanics in first edition and helped flesh\
  \ out their lore in <em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #152: Legacy of the Lost God</em>.\
  \ My next major release will be my first Adventure Path installment, \"Ready? Fight!\"\

  \ Edition.<br> In Lost <em>Omens Ancestry Guide</em>, I created the sprites. I'm\
  \ a big fan of fey, and I wanted to express that in this section. Plus, since I\
  \ was also working on Bestiary 3, I was able to coordinate adding three brand new\
  \ types of sprites in both books, as heritages and new creatures: Thanks to the\
  \ creativity of Eleanor and Luis, we came up with draxie (dragon sprites), melixies\
  \ (insect sprites, often bees), and nyktera (bat sprites)!<br> Check out my twitch\
