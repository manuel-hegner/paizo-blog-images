  \ \n    <p itemprop=\"description\"><i><a href=\"/products/btpy9cqn\">Firesoul</a>\
  \ is a tale of Jiri, who was found as an infant in the ashes of her village and\
  \ taken in by a neighboring shaman to be trained as a powerful jungle druid. When\
  \ Aspis Consortium mercenaries release an ancient evil that burns her adopted home\
  \ to the ground, Jiri must gather a group of her own to uncover the secrets of a\
  \ lost nation and stop the fire spirit—and the greedy treasure hunters trying to\
  \ leash it for their own ends—before it lays waste to the entire Mwangi Expanse.</i></p>\
  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <h2>Chapter Two: The Pyre</h2> \n     <p>There were\
  \ no animals.</p> \n     <p>Jiri could still hear them in the jungle all around,\
  \ the birds, monkeys, and bats, but their familiar cries were all distant. Even\
  \ more unsettling, no insects flashed iridescent in the thin sunbeams that filtered\
  \ down through the canopy, or swirled around her, eager to feast on her blood or\
  \ sweat.</p> \n     <p>Ever since she was old enough to walk, Jiri had been warned\
  \ never to pass the statue of the Mango Woman.</p> \n     <p>What tainted aura warned\
  \ the animals to stay away?</p> \n     <p>Whatever it was, it touched the plants,\
  \ too. Around her, the undergrowth grew thinner, sparser. The ground beneath the\
  \ trees finally turned into empty red earth, mottled with patches of gray. Scarred\
  \ ground, burned ground. The trees that arched over them looked the same: Their\
  \ bark looked charred, and their leaves curled in, tattered and black. Twisted,\
  \ injured, dying, they clawed at the empty sky, and the mud steamed between their\
  \ roots.</p> \n     <p>\"There's something here.\"</p> \n     <p>Jiri barely breathed\
  \ the words, but Oza caught them. The old shaman nodded, but his hand touched his\
  \ mouth.</p> \n     <p>Jiri locked her teeth together. They were hunting, and she\
  \ should be silent, but...It was in the ground, in the tortured trees, in the air:\
  \ a smell like smoke, a faint brush of heat. Some spirit touched the world here,\
  \ something old and terrible, and Jiri burned with its presence.</p> \n     <p>With\
  \ a deep, silent breath, Jiri forced the feeling back, locked it down and drifted\
  \ like a shadow behind her teacher as he stalked forward. Just ahead of them, past\
  \ the crumbling corpses of a few more trees, the Pyre rose.</p> \n     <p>It stood\
  \ in the middle of a small, shallow lake, the black water a still mirror that refused\
  \ to reflect the clouds and sun overhead. The Pyre stood like a stony splinter in\
  \ the water's dark eye, a jagged rock cracked and blackened, as if touched by some\
  \ ancient inferno. Ashes crowned its shattered peak, and the air over them twisted\
  \ with a shimmer of heat.</p> \n     <p>Jiri stared at that warped curtain and her\
  \ concentration disintegrated.</p> \n     <p><i>Like flames, like...</i>In her head\
  \ she saw fire and flame, dancing all around her. Tall and beautiful, and everything\
  \ was turning to smoke and ash, burning and rising and whirling and going away,\
  \ even the screams...</p> \n     <p>Oza's fingers pinched hard on her earlobe, and\
  \ Jiri gasped into the palm of his other hand, the one he pressed against her lips.\
  \ The shaman's dark eyes were inches from hers, blocking the Pyre, staring at her\
  \ until she nodded. Then he slowly took his hands away. Angry at herself, Jiri looked\
  \ past him at stone and ash and—</p> \n     <p>Jiri jerked her eyes away from the\
  \ broken mirror of heat that hovered over those ashes. She didn't understand what\
  \ it was that she had seen there, but she didn't want to see it again.</p> \n  \
  \   <p><i>I don't.</i></p> \n     <p>Instead, she forced her eyes to trace over\
  \ the fire-blackened cliff that the ashes rested on. Halfway up she found the door,\
  \ the opening like a wound in the rock. The stone that had once covered it like\
  \ a scar now lay in the water below, a slab the size of a hippo, and Jiri wondered\
  \ how the intruders had moved it.</p> \n     <p><i>And how do we move it back?</i></p>\
  \ \n     <p>Oza touched Jiri's hand, motioning for her to stay by the blackened\
  \ trunk of the dead tree they had crept up behind. Then he stepped into the open\
  \ and began to chant. Rough and low-pitched, the words scraped through the shaman's\
  \ lips, a call to the bones of the earth.</p> \n     <p>They answered.</p> \n  \
  \   <p>The ground shifted at the pool's edge, stone tearing through dirt skin. Oza's\
  \ hands rose, and mud twisted like tendons around the rough rock, snapping it together\
  \ into a crude parody of a man. An avalanche on thick legs, the elemental towered\
  \ over them, staring down at the man who had called it into the world with gleaming\
  \ eyes of gem. When Oza pointed, the earth spirit lurched into the water and splashed\
  \ toward the Pyre, its rough hands reaching.</p> \n     <p>Stone ground against\
  \ stone when the elemental grasped the great slab, and dirty water poured from its\
  \ body as the rocks that formed it shifted. Slowly the earth spirit began to lift\
  \ the massive boulder, scraping it against the Pyre's cliff face, until at last\
  \ it raised it back into place, covering the door's dark opening. Jiri watched the\
  \ stone man work, so tense with triumph that she almost missed it when the water\
  \ behind the elemental began to swirl.</p> \n     <p>The thing broke the surface\
  \ of the pool with a roar, sunlight flashing off slick green skin and black scales.\
  \ Smaller than the elemental, but still much larger than Jiri, it looked like some\
  \ hideous amalgamation of gorilla, crocodile, and toad. Lunging up, it dug great\
  \ claws deep into the mud and stone flesh of the elemental. It pulled the giant\
  \ back, and its teeth flashed. The sound of those great fangs scraping against stone\
  \ tore the air like a shriek.</p> \n     <p><i>Not a beast, not a spirit—gods and\
  \ ancestors, what </i>is<i> that thing? </i>Jiri was scrambling back, her spear\
  \ up, a puny, useless threat raised between her and the monster.<i> And how can\
  \ it smell so bad?</i></p> \n     <p>It reeked of stagnant water and dead things,\
  \ rot and gangrene and something else, something acrid and bitter and unnatural.\
  \ The smell made Jiri's stomach heave, her eyes run, and she had to wipe her tears\
  \ away to see the thing snarl and attack again.</p> \n     <p>The monster's claws\
  \ gouged deep into living earth as it pulled itself up, climbing the elemental.\
  \ Lunging forward, it drove its fangs into the earth spirit's head. With a vicious\
  \ twist of its neck, the scaly thing ripped the lumpy stone head free from the thick,\
  \ muddy shoulders and spat it down into the dark water.</p> \n     <p>Terror and\
  \ nausea tore through Jiri, but she held her place, not running. Forcing herself\
  \ to look away from the battle, she found Oza. His eyes met hers, flashing with\
  \ warning.</p> \n     <p>\"They left us a demon, Jiri. Stay back, and be ready to\
  \ run.\"</p> \n     <p>The shaman turned away from her before Jiri could answer\
  \ that. His hand drew a circle over his head, and he shouted for the spirits of\
  \ fire. A spark gathered in Oza's hand, grew bright and hot into a flame that shot\
  \ away from him, toward the demon.</p> \n     <p>The fire twisted in the air, thickened,\
  \ red flame taking the shape of a mamba racing with gaping jaws toward the demon\
  \ that still had its claws deep in the elemental's stony back. As Oza's spell neared\
  \ it, the stinking thing jerked its claws apart, making mud gout like black blood\
  \ as it tore the earth-wrought spirit apart, roaring with triumph. Then the fire\
  \ serpent slammed into it, and the roar into a howl. For a moment, the demon stood,\
  \ a misshapen shadow wrapped in flame. Then it fell, vanishing beneath the dark\
  \ water with a splash.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb360\">\n      <a href=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Firesoul-Jiri.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n      <br>For Jiri, fire solves many problems.\n     </div> \n     <p>\"\
  Is it—\" Jiri started, eyes watering from the sickening smell of the demon, but\
  \ Oza cut her off.</p> \n     <p>\"No.\" His hands were moving, drawing jagged lines\
  \ in the air as he called the spirits again.</p> \n     <p><i>He hasn't told me\
  \ to run yet.</i></p> \n     <p>That was something, wasn't it? And before it had\
  \ fallen, the elemental had shoved the stone back over the gap that had been opened\
  \ in the Pyre. Jiri watched the dark water shimmer, and for the first time since\
  \ the demon had surfaced she felt her own power, burning like a coal beneath the\
  \ dead ashes of her fear.</p> \n     <p>Stepping from her hiding place, Jiri reached\
  \ for the spirits. When she felt them answer, felt life and resilience boil into\
  \ her, she moved forward and brushed her hand across her teacher's back, letting\
  \ the power flow into him.</p> \n     <p>\"Thank you,\" Oza said, voice harsh with\
  \ strain as he held tight to the magic the spirits had given him. \"Now by all those\
  \ who came before you, stand back.\"</p> \n     <p>For a moment Jiri didn't move,\
  \ her hands hot with magic. But she couldn't disobey Oza. She took one step back,\
  \ another, and then the water before them split.</p> \n     <p>The demon broke the\
  \ surface roaring, claws reaching, eyes flashing hate and hunger. Oza roared back,\
  \ cutting the air before him with his spear, and the water between the demon and\
  \ the shaman shattered with spray. Vines exploded up, green and thick as a man's\
  \ leg, twisting into knots around each other as they rose. Thorns covered the vines,\
  \ long as spearpoints, and they scraped over the demon's hide as the great tangle\
  \ surged over it.</p> \n     <p>Jiri felt anger and triumph burn through her, and\
  \ without thinking she raised a hand. A flash of fire burst from her palm, striking\
  \ the demon, barely singeing it.</p> \n     <p>\"Back,\" Oza snapped again, and\
  \ then he began to call out another summoning.</p> \n     <p>In the water, the demon\
  \ tore at the vines. Thorns gouged it, but their sharp points couldn't penetrate\
  \ its reeking hide. The demon ignored them, ripped one of its arms free, and lashed\
  \ out.</p> \n     <p>Oza moved back, barely staying out of reach of those huge claws,\
  \ and finished his call. The water behind the demon surged and swirled, roiled by\
  \ the thing taking shape beneath its surface.</p> \n     <p>Rumbling something like\
  \ a curse, the demon pulled itself free of the vines and lunged after Oza, claws\
  \ spread. Jiri shouted and threw fire again, barely a spell, more her rage and fear\
  \ flung out into the world to destroy. But her attack sizzled to nothing against\
  \ the thing's slimy hide.</p> \n     <p>The demon swung its head and tiny crocodile\
  \ eyes found Jiri. Its thin lips skinned back, showing its terrible teeth, and the\
  \ monster hunched like a toad, ready to spring.</p> \n     <p>Jiri stared at the\
  \ demon, knowing it was going to kill her, but she raised her spear and called for\
  \ the spirits, determined to draw blood before she died.</p> \n     <p>Then the\
  \ tentacles caught it.</p> \n     <p>Striking like snakes, they wrapped around the\
  \ demon, a hundred suckers biting down. In the black water, the slimy, giant-eyed\
  \ thing Oza had pulled from the spirit world clacked the beak that lay in the center\
  \ of its nest of tentacles and jerked the demon back.</p> \n     <p>\"Jiri, go.\"\
  \ On the muddy bank, Oza was reaching for his necklace. \"Run!\" he shouted, and\
  \ the word slipped into a roar as the shaman changed, grew claws and fangs and black-striped\
  \ fur.</p> \n     <p>Jiri clutched her spear, paralyzed.</p> \n     <p><i>But we're\
  \ winning.</i></p> \n     <p>Tentacles wrapped the demon, and the great tiger Oza\
  \ had become slashed its claws between them, spilling stinking gouts of blood. If\
  \ Jiri stayed—</p> \n     <p>The demon threw back its head, and roared a word.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The twisted, evil power of it broke the air. It tore through Jiri's\
  \ body like poisoned hooks, filled her lungs like filthy water. The world shuddered\
  \ around her, dimmed, and Jiri felt herself being ripped away, sent into darkness.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><i>No.</i></p> \n     <p>She held on with all that she could, straining\
  \ for light, for heat, for life, and suddenly she was back in her body, sprawled\
  \ retching in the mud. Dully, she could see the demon, laughing as it tore limp\
  \ tentacles off its hide. The massive tiger crouched before it, his gray-shot muzzle\
  \ bent and dripping blood.</p> \n     <p>\"Oza,\" Jiri groaned.</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ cat raised his head and his eyes met Jiri's, old and stern. Then he turned and\
  \ leapt at the monster, roaring, even as the demon wrapped its claws around him.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Oza,\" Jiri said again, but she pulled herself up, made herself turn\
  \ and stagger away, doing what those eyes had ordered her to do. Stumbling into\
  \ a run, she whispered as she moved, begging the spirits to hide the tracks of her\
  \ passage.</p> \n     <p>Running beneath the dead trees, Jiri tried not to listen\
  \ to the booming laughter that echoed behind her, hideous and triumphant.</p> \n\
