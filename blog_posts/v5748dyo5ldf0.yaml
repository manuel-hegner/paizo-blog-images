  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Friday, May 4, 2012</p> \n   <p>We're getting close to\
  \ having revealed all of the miniatures in the upcoming <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids\"\
  >Pathfinder Battles</a> set, <a href=\"/products/btpy8rqs\">Rise of the Runelords</a>!\
  \ It seems like only a few weeks ago that I started showing of sculpts and paint\
  \ masters, but in fact it's been months, and as I type this the production run of\
  \ miniatures is trundling through the factory. All of the paint schemes have been\
  \ approved, all the decisions have been made, and now all that's left is the waiting\
  \ for the early August release.</p> \n   <p>Well, the waiting and a few more previews,\
  \ that is!</p> \n   <p>Two weeks ago I promised something ugly, and today I'm fulfilling\
  \ that dark pledge with three figures from the murkier side of the set. These are\
  \ nasty dudes you <i>definitely</i> don't want to run into in a dark alley, and\
  \ all three of them make creepy additions to your game table.</p> \n   <div class=\"\

  /image/content/Blog/20120504-Ogrekin_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n   </div> \n\
  \   <p>Up first is the Ogrekin, a nasty in-bred half-ogre whose clan is the centerpiece\
  \ of “The Hook Mountain Massacre,” the third chapter in the <a href=\"/products/btpy8mqq\"\
  >Rise of the Runelords Adventure Path</a>. With rippling muscles and a deformed\
  \ (really gross) head, this bruiser wanders the wilderness looking... well, let's\
  \ just say he's “looking for love,” and leave it at that. This common miniature\
  \ is technically Medium-sized, but he's pushing the top-end of that scale, and makes\
  \ for a really intimidating figure.</p> \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    <a\
  \ href=\"/image/content/Blog/20120504-FacelessStalker.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/20120504-FacelessStalker_120.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n   </div> \n   <p>Faceless Stalkers were created in ancient\
  \ times by the mysterious aboleths as interlocutors with the various air-breathing\
  \ races of the surface world. Via a painful biological process, the creatures can\
  \ warp and contort their form to take on the appearance of an enemy. When not pretending\
  \ to be your wife or best friend, these guys run around in the gross, misshapen\
  \ form revealed here. The photograph above doesn't quite show off the nasty detail\
  \ of reddish ink in all of the nooks and fleshy crannies along this guy's skin (especially\
  \ on his back). The Faceless Stalker is statted up in <a href=\"/products/btpy8hif\"\
  >Bestiary 2</a>, but even if you don't have that resource, this common figure doubles\
  \ as any kind of hideous humanoid. Ick!</p> \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n \
  \   <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/20120504-SkinsawCultist.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/20120504-SkinsawCultist_120.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n   </div> \n   <p>Last up today we have a friendly neighborhood\
  \ initiate in the local cult of homicidal slasher maniacs, known to the denizens\
  \ of Varisia as the Skinsaw Cultist! This common figure makes a nice rank-and-file\
  \ cultist. His skinsaw mask and war razor root him firmly in the Pathfinder Campaign\
  \ Setting, while his robes and general creepiness make him a good troop-builder\
  \ for a wicked cult in any campaign.</p> \n   <p>That's it for this week. I've only\
  \ got a few more sculpts to show off, but I promise that some absolutely amazing\
  \ stuff is still waiting to be shown! Come back next week for another early look\
  \ at <a href=\"/products/btpy8rqs\">Rise of the Runelords</a> Pathfinder Battles\
  \ miniatures!</p> \n   <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p> \n  </blockquote> <!--\
