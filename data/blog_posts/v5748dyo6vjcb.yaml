  \     </div>\n     <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\"></p>\n      <p>Everyone\
  \ on the Starfinder team agrees that the setting is our favorite part of the game.\
  \ As stewards of Starfinder, we’re more interested in preserving and expanding lore\
  \ than we are in reinventing it, but a new edition is the perfect time to update\
  \ our beloved setting. Here are a few exciting changes you can look forward to in\
  \ Starfinder Second Edition!</p>\n      <p><strong>Aucturn explodes!</strong> That’\
  s right, everybody; we’re kicking Starfinder Second Edition off with a bang and\
  \ blowing up one of the Pact Worlds! For those who weren’t keeping up, Aucturn is\
  \ the most distant, mysterious planet in the sun’s orbit (kind of like Pluto), except\
  \ it has a toxic atmosphere and is crawling with monsters like orocorans and carrion\
  \ wheels. Yikes! To make things worse, most people who live on Aucturn are cultists\
  \ of eldritch gods. That said, though it was a pretty weird place, nobody expected\
  \ it to explode!</p>\n      <p>Many people in the Pact Worlds believed Aucturn was\
  \ really an egg. There was even a cult dedicated to nurturing the eldritch being\
  \ inside it, and it’s rumored that the planet’s ruler drank his power from the unborn\
  \ monstrosity. Well, it turns out they were right—Aucturn <em>is</em> an egg, and\
  \ it just hatched. As you can imagine, this immediately caused problems in Pact\
  \ Worlds space and across the whole galaxy. Magic went haywire, planets got knocked\
  \ out of orbit, people experienced bizarre visions, and a strange new god called\
  \ the Newborn emerged into cosmic consciousness. The weirdness isn’t going to end\
  \ anytime soon, but it all starts with the playtest. Play<a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02ez5?Starfinder-Second-Edition-Playtest-Adventure-A-Cosmic-Birthday\"\
  ><em>A Cosmic Birthday</em></a><em>, </em>a playtest module for 1st-level characters,\
  \ if you want to experience the disaster/miracle of the Newborn’s emergence firsthand.&nbsp;</p>\n\
  \      <p><strong>Pulonis declares independence! </strong>Pulonis (formerly known\
  \ as Vesk-6) was defeated and occupied by the Veskarium for a long time, but its\
  \ war for freedom never truly ended. While Veskarium forces were stretched thin\
  \ during the Drift Crisis, Pulonis finally achieved independence. Soon after, Pulonis\
  \ joined the Pact alliance as the first full member not located in the Pact Worlds\
  \ system. Starfinder Second Edition is celebrating Pulonis by adding pahtras as\
  \ a core ancestry and Meyel the Dancing Fury (their patron god) as a core deity.\
  \ Surely this won’t upset the Veskarium, right? Well, speaking of that…</p>\n  \
  \    <p><strong>Azlanti Star Empire challenges the Veskarium!</strong> It’s the\
  \ war we’ve all been waiting for—let them fight! The Pact Council must have been\
  \ feeling pretty smug about the Veskarium getting distracted right after the stunt\
  \ they pulled with Pulonis, until they realized that an interstellar war has far-reaching\
  \ consequences even for those who aren’t involved. If you want to be part of Starfinder\
  \ history and experience the beginning of this war, play<a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq047ul?Starfinder-Second-Edition-Playtest-Adventure-Empires-Devoured\"\
  ><em>Empires Devoured</em></a>, a playtest module for 10th-level characters.</p>\n\

  \ You’ll notice that old favorites like Oras and Triune have been joined by some\
  \ new divine faces. We’ve added the patron gods of the Azlanti Star Empire and Pulonis,\
  \ as well as two completely new deities that emerged after recent cosmic events,\
  \ to the list of core deities. Now your character can be a rune-scourged follower\
  \ of Lissala, a graceful warrior of Meyel, study the enigma of the Newborn, or channel\
  \ pain into art for Zon-Shelyn. You can read more about all the gods, old and new,\
  \ in the<a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02ez4\"><em>Starfinder Playtest\
