  \    <p itemprop=\"description\">All it takes is a cursory browse of the Paizo forums\
  \ to see that paladins are not just the most contentious class in Pathfinder, they\
  \ are the most contentious conversation topic. Weeks before we previewed the class,\
  \ multiple threads with thousands of posts arose in advance, filled with passionate\
  \ fans with many different opinions and plenty of good ideas. Turns out, the Paizo\
  \ office isn't too different.</p> \n    <h2>The Quest for the Holy Grail</h2> \n\
  \    <p>Early last year, I went on a sacred quest through the office and surveyed\
  \ all the different opinions out there about paladins. Turns out, almost everyone\
  \ had slightly different thoughts. But there was one element in common: whether\
  \ they wanted paladins of all alignments, paladins of the four extreme alignments,\
  \ lawful good paladins and chaotic evil antipaladins, lawful evil tyrant antipaladins,\
  \ or even just lawful good paladins alone, everyone was interested in robust support\
  \ for the idea that paladins should be champions of their deity and alignment. That\
  \ is to say, whatever alignments paladins have, they should have an array of abilities\
  \ deeply tied into that alignment.</p> \n    <p>Since that was the aspect of the\
  \ paladin that everyone agreed upon, that's what we wanted to make sure we got right\
  \ in the playtest. But given the limited space for the playtest, we chose to focus\
  \ on getting that aspect fine-tuned for one alignment, and so in this book we're\
  \ presenting only lawful good paladins. That doesn't mean antipaladins and tyrants\
  \ are gone (there's even an antipaladin foe in one of the adventures!) or that the\
  \ door is closed to other sorts of paladins down the road. We'll have a playtest\
  \ survey on the matter, we're open to more opinions, and even among the four designers\
  \ we have different ideas. But we want to focus the playtest on getting lawful good\
  \ paladins right, first and foremost. If or when we do make more paladins and antipaladins,\
  \ having constructed a solid foundation for how an alignment-driven champion functions\
  \ will be a crucial step to making all of them engaging and different in play.</p>\

  ></a> \n     <p><i>Illustration by Wayne Reynolds</i></p>\n    </div> \n    <h2>The\
  \ Code</h2> \n    <p>Tell me if you've heard this one before: My paladin was brought\
  \ to a court where she was forced to testify under oath to tell the whole truth,\
  \ by a legitimate authority, about the whereabouts of certain innocent witnesses,\
  \ but she knows that if she answers the questions, a villain is going to use that\
  \ information to track down and harm the innocents. It's the \"Inquiring Murderer\"\
  \ quandary from moral philosophy set in a way that manages to pin you between not\
  \ just two but three different restrictions in the old paladin code. Sure, I can\
  \ beg and plead with the judge that the information, if released, would harm innocents,\
  \ but ultimately if the judge persists, I'm in trouble. These sorts of situations\
  \ are some of the most common paladin threads on the forums, and they're never easy.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>With the playtest presenting the opportunity, I wanted to analyze the\
  \ paladin's code down to basic principles and keep all the important roleplaying\
  \ aspects that make paladins the trustworthy champions of law and good we've come\
  \ to expect while drastically reducing, and hopefully eliminating, the no-win situations.\
  \ Here's what it looks like at the moment.</p> \n    <h3>Code of Conduct</h3> \n\
  \    <p>Paladins are divine champions of a deity. You must be lawful good and worship\
  \ a deity that allows lawful good clerics. Actions fundamentally opposed to your\
  \ deity's alignment or ideals are anathema to your faith. A few examples of acts\
  \ that would be considered anathema appear in each deity's entry. You and your GM\
  \ will determine whether other acts count as anathema.</p> \n    <p>In addition,\
  \ you must follow the paladin's code below. Deities often add additional strictures\
  \ for their own paladins (for instance, Shelyn's paladins never attack first except\
  \ to protect an innocent, and they choose and perfect an art).</p> \n    <p>If you\
  \ stray from lawful good, perform acts anathema to your deity, or violate your code\
  \ of conduct, you lose your Spell Point pool and righteous ally class feature (which\
  \ we talk more about below) until you demonstrate your repentance by conducting\
  \ an <i>atone</i> ritual, but you keep any other paladin abilities that don't require\
  \ those class features.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <div class=\"callout-blurb\"\
  > \n      <h4>The Paladin's Code</h4> \n      <p>The following is the fundamental\
  \ code all paladins follow. The tenets are listed in order of importance, starting\
  \ with the most important. If a situation places two tenets in conflict, you aren't\
  \ in a no-win situation; instead, follow the most important tenet. For instance,\
  \ if an evil king asked you if innocent lawbreakers were hiding in your church so\
  \ he could execute them, you could lie to him, since the tenet forbidding you to\
  \ lie is less important than the tenet prohibiting the harm of an innocent. An attempt\
  \ to subvert the paladin code by engineering a situation allowing you to use a higher\
  \ tenet to ignore a lower tenet (telling someone that you won't respect lawful authorities\
  \ so that the tenet of not lying supersedes the tenet of respecting lawful authorities,\
  \ for example) is a violation of the paladin code.</p> \n      <ul> \n       <li>You\
  \ must never willingly commit an evil act, such as murder, torture, or casting an\
  \ evil spell.</li> \n       <li>You must not take actions that you know will harm\
  \ an innocent, or through inaction cause an innocent to come to immediate harm when\
  \ you knew your action could reasonably prevent it. This tenet doesn't force you\
  \ to take action against possible harm to innocents or to sacrifice your life and\
  \ future potential in an attempt to protect an innocent.</li> \n       <li>You must\
  \ act with honor, never cheating, lying, or taking advantage of others.</li> \n\
  \       <li>You must respect the lawful authority of the legitimate ruler or leadership\
  \ in whichever land you may be, following their laws unless they violate a higher\
  \ tenet.</li> \n      </ul> \n     </div> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>So let's\
  \ break down what's the same and what's different. We still have all the basic tenets\
  \ of the paladin from Pathfinder First Edition, with one exception: we've removed\
  \ poison from the tenet of acting with honor. While there are certainly dishonorable\
  \ ways to use poison, poisoning a weapon and using it in an honorable combat that\
  \ allows enhanced weaponry doesn't seem much different than lighting the weapon\
  \ on fire. However, by ordering the tenets and allowing the paladin to prioritize\
  \ the most important tenets in the event of a conflict, we've cut down on the no-win\
  \ situations. And of course, this opens a design space to play around with the tenets\
  \ themselves, something we've done by incorporating one of the most popular non-core\
  \ aspects for paladins...</p> \n    <h3>Oaths</h3> \n    <p>Oaths allow you to play\
  \ around with the tenets of your code while also gaining mechanical advantages.\
  \ For instance, the Fiendsbane Oath allows you to dish out near-constant retribution\
  \ against fiends and eventually block their dimensional travel with an Anchoring\
  \ Aura. Unlike in Pathfinder First Edition, oaths are feats, and you don't need\
  \ an archetype to gain one.</p> \n    <h2>Paladin Features</h2> \n    <p>As many\
  \ of you guessed when Jason mentioned it, paladin was the mystery class that gains\
  \ the highest heavy armor proficiency, eventually reaching legendary proficiency\
  \ in armor and master proficiency in weapons, as opposed to fighters, who gain the\
  \ reverse. At 1st level, you also gain the Retributive Strike reaction, allowing\
  \ you to counterattack and enfeeble any foe that hits one of your allies (Shelyn\
  \ save those who strike your storm druid ally). You also get <i>lay on hands</i>,\
  \ a single-action healing spell that not only heals the target but also raises their\
  \ AC for a round to help prevent future damage. Combine that effect used on yourself\
  \ with a raised shield, and you can make it pretty hard for a foe to hit you, and\
  \ it helps recovering allies avoid another beating.</p> \n    <p><i>Lay on hands</i>\
  \ is the first of a paladin's champion powers, which include a whole bunch of elective\
  \ options via feats. One of my favorites, gained automatically at 19th level, is\
  \ <i>hero's defiance</i>, which makes a paladin incredibly difficult to take down.\
  \ It lets you keep standing when you fall to 0 HP, gives you a big boost of Hit\
  \ Points, and doesn't even use up your reaction! Leading up to that, you gain a\
  \ bunch of fun smite-related boosts, including the righteous ally class feature\
  \ that you saw mentioned in the code. This is a 3rd-level ability that lets you\
  \ house a holy spirit in a weapon or a steed, much like before, but also in a shield,\
  \ like the fan-favorite sacred shield archetype!</p> \n    <h2>Paladin Feats</h2>\
  \ \n    <p>In addition to the oath feats I mentioned when talking about the code,\
  \ paladins have feats customized to work with the various righteous ally options,\
  \ like Second Ally, a level 8 feat that lets you gain a second righteous ally. There\
  \ are also a variety of auras that you can gain to improve yourself and your allies,\
  \ from the humble 4th-level Aura of Courage, which reduces the frightened condition\
  \ for you when you gain it and at the end of your turn for you and your allies,\
  \ to the mighty 14th-level Aura of Righteousness, which gives you and your allies\
  \ resistance to evil damage. Feats that improve or alter your <i>lay on hands </i>include\
  \ mercy feats, which allow you to remove harmful conditions and afflictions with\
  \ <i>lay on hands</i>, up to and including death itself with Ultimate Mercy. And\
  \ we can't forget potent additional reactions like Divine Grace, granting you a\
  \ saving throw boost at 2nd level, and Attack of Opportunity at 6th level.</p> \n\
  \    <p>To close out, I'll tell you about one more popular non-core paladin ability\
  \ we brought in, a special type of power called...</p> \n    <h3>Litanies</h3> \n\
  \    <p>Following their mold from <em>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat</em>, litanies\
  \ are single-action Verbal Casting spells that last 1 round and create various effects.\
  \ For instance, <i>litany of righteousness </i>makes an enemy weak to your allies'\
  \ attacks, and <i>litany against sloth </i>slows down an enemy, costing it reactions\
  \ and potentially actions as well. One of the coolest story features of the litanies\
  \ against sins is that they now explicitly work better against creatures strongly\
  \ aligned with their sin, so a dretch (a.k.a. a sloth demon) or a sloth sinspawn\
  \ treats its saving throw outcome for <i>litany against sloth</i> as one degree\
  \ worse!</p> \n    <p>Just as a reminder to everyone, please be respectful to each\
  \ other. Many of us have strong opinions about the paladin, and that's OK, even\
  \ if we each have different feelings.</p> \n    <p>Mark Seifter<br> <i>Designer</i></p>\
