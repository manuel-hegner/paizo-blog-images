  artist: "the way), it's worth remembering that a lot of the streets and freeways\
    \ out this side are on hills. And when you mix snow and hills, you get icy chutes\
    \ that can only be navigated by things like white dragons who have the icewalking\
    \ ability. Anyway, rant about ranting aside, the reason there's been a dearth\
    \ of blogs lately is that very few of us at Paizo have been able to get into the\
    \ office lately, and as a result, blog writing has kinda been set aside. I'm sitting\
    \ at home, typing this blog with a blanket on my shoulders and a space heater\
    \ aimed at my feet, after having ventured outside to snap the following picture.\
    \ It was while I took the picture that I think I heard that yeti stomping around\
    \ somewhere. I ain't going back outside till he's been driven off by the local\
    \ sasquatches, who, of course, aren't coming out until the snow goes away. Stupid\
    \ sasquatches. You can never trust them to be there when you need them... James\
    \ Jacobs Editor-in-Chief"
