  \ <br><i>Illustration by Wayne Reynolds</i>\n      </div> \n      <p>The path of\
  \ the initiate is long and fraught with danger. For Rivani, the journey began as\
  \ a young girl of 12 in the teeming city of Chendras, in the distant land of Vudra.\
  \ Born the seventh daughter of a minor functionary in the court of a great rajah,\
  \ Rivani seemed set to follow her sisters into a life of government service. Always\
  \ a precocious child, Rivani took well to her studies, spending hours in her master's\
  \ library studying tomes she could barely comprehend. She especially favored lavishly\
  \ illustrated accounts of harrowing victories over fantastic creatures, or voluminous\
  \ surveys of distant lands and their many peoples, monsters, and mysteries. Rivani\
  \ thrilled at imagining herself traveling to those distant lands as a questing hero,\
  \ and soon these whimsical idylls consumed her every thought. As her revels grew\
  \ more vivid, Rivani grew more distant from her sisters, putting her presumed future\
  \ as a courtier at risk.</p> \n      <p>The rishis at court saw promise in the young\
  \ girl's whimsy, and implored the rajah to put Rivani to the Trial of the White\
  \ Lotus, a simple test to determine a child's mental aptitudes. After a series of\
  \ intelligence and motor skill challenges, the rajah's poets probed Rivani's knowledge\
  \ of the world's esoteric nature. They were surprised to discover that Rivani's\
  \ reading had already set her on the path to spiritual development. She knew of\
  \ the growth of the soul through reincarnation, of the astral body and the etheric\
  \ double, and of the distant planes that house them. She knew also the rudiments\
  \ of ki, the energy force that binds all living things into a spiritual family.\
  \ In terms of esoteric theory, Rivani knew more than most third-year chelas. A promising\
  \ child, indeed.</p> \n      <p>But it all came down to the Trial of the White Lotus.\
  \ Following the minor challenges, the rishis brought Rivani to a secret room within\
  \ the onion dome of the rajah's highest tower, and there revealed a lush garden\
  \ of fabulous flowers and colorful plants. Here was a verris bulb from distant Kaladay,\
  \ there a purple jonquil from mythical Hermea. A massive quanlum bush—identical\
  \ to the specimen allegedly recovered by Khiben-Sald himself on the far planet of\
  \ Castrovel—dominated a far wall, next to a collection of ghorus seeds floating\
  \ in a nutrient tank. And at the center of the room lay a pedestal, and on that\
  \ pedestal a simple white lotus—Rivani's final challenge.</p> \n      <p>\"Cast\
  \ forth your mind,\" the rishis bade her. \"Merge your life essence with that of\
  \ the flower and realize that you and she are but tongues of the same flickering\
  \ cosmic flame.\" Rivani closed her eyes and concentrated on regulating her breath,\
  \ relying on techniques she'd read inscribed upon an archaic manuscript of palm\
  \ leaves by a lost yogi brotherhood. With each exhalation, she pushed her consciousness\
  \ deeper beyond her physical body into the scintillating emanations of ki that comprised\
  \ her health aura. At first, Rivani wasn't sure if she simply imagined that it was\
  \ so, but when her mind conjured the thought of her aura touching upon that of the\
  \ white lotus, she felt her spirit lighten, and a beatific calm overcame her.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Sensing a breakthrough, the rishis instructed Rivani to infuse her\
  \ ki with that of the plant, to meld her mind with its animating force and open\
  \ its closed petals. As she considered their instruction, Rivani pictured the bulb\
  \ of the lotus opening one petal at a time. From within the flower glowed a coruscation\
  \ of colorful energy Rivani inherently knew represented the force of life itself.\
  \ It flourished within the tiny cup of the white lotus, but it burned with an intensity\
  \ that echoed that of the sun. At that moment Rivani realized—not just read, but\
  \ truly realized—that all life, hers, the flower's, even the sun's, were but aspects\
  \ of the same glorious creation. As her conviction grew deeper, as the petals of\
  \ the white lotus opened faster and faster, Rivani became aware that her mind also\
  \ opened itself one petal at a time. Sweat dripped from her brow, threatening to\
  \ distract from her spiritual unfoldment by reminding her of the limits of her physical\
  \ body, but still Rivani delved deeper. </p> \n      <p>In her mind's eye, Rivani\
  \ stepped further and further into the light until she could no longer distinguish\
  \ herself from the flower. But she felt other presences, too. The poets of the court\
  \ were also part of the fabric of life, and Rivani brushed against their innermost\
  \ thoughts without even meaning to. She saw their anticipation, their pride, their\
  \ amazement at her unexpected power. She saw too their betrayals, their scandalous\
  \ secrets, and their venal, immoral ambitions. Rivani had passed the Trial of the\
  \ White Lotus, but none of the rajah's rishis celebrated her victory.</p> \n   \
  \   <p>Instead, certain that her unexpected foray into their consciousness had revealed\
  \ secrets that could threaten their status at court, the rishis proclaimed Rivani\
  \ a mahatma reborn, the vessel of a world teacher consciousness returned to Golarion\
  \ to guide the people into a new age. Just not in Vudra. </p> \n      <p>With the\
  \ blessings of a rajah nervous about his advisors' tales of Rivani's mind-reading\
  \ prowess, the rishis dispatched their blessed student across the sea to the Isle\
  \ of Jalmeray, there to further study among the adepts of the Houses of Perfection.\
  \ Each of the that institution's three monasteries welcomed their honored visitor\
  \ from the East, but the Monastery of Unblinking Flame in particular seemed most\
  \ eager to accept her into their ranks. Even as far away as Chendas, Rivani had\
  \ heard tales of the Houses of Perfection and their \"impossible\" entrance trials.\
  \ Steeling herself for the test of a lifetime, Rivani prepared, as her books instructed,\
  \ to outwit an efreeti. </p> \n      <p>Instead, white-robed warrior monks escorted\
  \ her to the monastery's courtyard garden for an audience with Anandala, the order's\
  \ ageless sovereign. She denied Rivani's entrance to study at the monastery, for\
  \ she was to be a teacher, not a student. \"Everything you could teach us you read\
  \ in a book,\" she said. \"We have read books. Go out into the world and learn to\
  \ live. Once you know something for yourself, come back to Jalmeray and teach us\
  \ what you have learned.\"</p> \n      <p>Thereafter, Rivani spent several months\
  \ as a librarian's assistant in Quantium before fleeing the city after becoming\
  \ a pawn in the psychic espionage and infighting of the Council of Three and Nine.\
  \ From there she ventured to Absalom, spending most of a year as a translator for\
  \ the esoteric manuscripts department of the Forae Logos before conflict with a\
  \ fellow librarian drummed her out on the streets. Although she still reads voraciously\
  \ and is seldom found without a well-thumbed book or two, Rivani henceforth swore\
  \ off finding the world's secrets in musty libraries, and finally set out to make\
  \ some discoveries of her own.</p> \n      <p>A life filled with so much travel\
  \ has filled Rivani with a wanderlust that borders on fatalistic. Her relationships\
  \ burn intensely but briefly, as she constantly guards against delving too deeply—\
  accidentally or otherwise—into the minds of her friends and lovers. She seems always\
  \ fixated on the next stop on her journey, and while of a generally kind nature\
  \ and friendly demeanor, she takes it as a matter of faith that she will soon be\
  \ moving on, and avoids long-lasting, deep connections with others. Rivani loves\
  \ nothing more than to share stories of her travels and cultural explorations, and\
  \ to receive the tales of others in return. Through all of this she's begun to develop\
  \ her own philosophy, but it will be many years, and many many more adventures to\
  \ come, before she will be ready to share her wisdom with the world. </p> \n   \
