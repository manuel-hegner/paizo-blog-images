  \  </div>\n     <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\">I’ve always been\
  \ a fan of the immersion factor that music and sound bring to TTRPGs. I have fond\
  \ memories from the olden times of collecting sound effect CDs from the Halloween\
  \ store to use as background ambience for dungeon-crawling sessions (and then probably\
  \ going through far too much effort trying to make the setting and the encounters\
  \ at least sort of match the audio). Granted, those weren’t always the best—if you’\
  ve never had the pleasure of engaging in a tense roleplaying session that keeps\
  \ getting interrupted by random screams and cackling like an extra in a rubber clown\
  \ mask at a third-tier state fair funhouse, you’re missing out—but fortunately,\
  \ the breadth and quality of <a href=\"https://syrinscape.com/pathfinder/\">available\
  \ sound and ambience options</a> have come a long way since then.</p>\n      <p>Music\
  \ is the same way. When you’re sitting around the table and your GM hits play on\
  \ something from the “Conan the Barbarian” soundtrack, you know it’s time for some\
  \ bad guys to get sworded and/or sorceried. When you hear that Shire theme from\
  \ the “Lord of the Rings” soundtrack, you know you’re about to enter a pastoral\
  \ little hamlet full of relatable NPCs that your GM will make you fall in love with\
  \ before shamelessly brutalizing and/or endangering them to raise the emotional\
  \ stakes. There’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3PfF-Huv2g\">a track\
  \ on the “Pirates of the Caribbean” soundtrack</a> that I’ll always associate with\
  \ a particularly nail-biting combat against a BBEG (more than I associate it with\
  \ the movie itself) just because it happened to come on at exactly the right time.</p>\n\
  \      <p>Anyway, where was I going with this? If you read the final paragraph of\
  \ <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sihk?Frights-of-Spring\">our\
  \ Season of Ghosts blog</a> last week, you may have caught our announcement that\
  \ Paizo has officially partnered with <a href=\"https://michaelghelfistudios.com/\"\
  >Michael Ghelfi Studios</a>—one of the industry’s leading producers of music and\
  \ audio specifically tailored for TTRPGs—to produce original music for select and\
  \ upcoming Pathfinder Adventure Paths! You can go check out our official <a href=\"\
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIffCZu6POg\">Season of Ghosts Adventure Path trailer</a>featuring\
  \ a taste of that music, and download the first track—aptly titled “Season of Ghosts”\
  —absolutely free, <a href=\"https://downloads.paizo.com/mgs/01_Season_of_Ghosts.mp3\"\
  >right here!</a></p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <iframe width=\"\

  \      </div>\n      <p>Well, I’m excited to announce that our next two Adventure\
  \ Paths—<a href=\"https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurepath/sevendoomsforsandpoint\"\
  >Seven Dooms for Sandpoint</a> and <a href=\"https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurepath/wardensofwildwood\"\
  >Wardens of Wildwood</a>—will both receive full-length soundtrack albums of their\
  \ own, which we hope to release alongside the first volume of each Adventure Path\
  \ so that you can use it to set the stage for your adventures from day one. Each\
  \ album is being created completely from scratch by a member of Michael Ghelfi’\
  s award-winning team of composers, working from input provided by each Adventure\
  \ Path’s lead developer on key themes, inspirations, major characters, and story\
  \ beats. It’s our hope that, not only will this awesome music enhance your games\
  \ today, but that years from now you’ll be able to listen to a track from one of\
  \ these albums and immediately associate it with a memorable NPC or moment from\
  \ your own campaign, much as I associate <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogHUNhevD20\"\
  >this track</a> with the time my character critically fumbled and accidentally dropped\
  \ his weapon off the side of a boat.</p>\n      <p>We’ll be offering each of these\
  \ albums as complete downloads on the Paizo store, and shortly after release, they’\
  ll also be available on Michael Ghelfi Studios’ <a href=\"https://michaelghelfi.bandcamp.com/\"\
  >Soundcloud</a>, <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/artist/17njitvUNAIx81UoflmQyi\"\
  >Spotify</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDed9jQ1Y1gKeyjvkyFGkCA\"\
  >YouTube</a>, and probably anywhere else you like to purchase digital music. Oh,\
  \ and just because we think it’s cool, we’ll also be including the complete Seven\
  \ Dooms for Sandpoint album with the adventure module for Foundry VTT, all cued\
  \ up and ready to score your valiant attempts to save Sandpoint from utter destruction.</p>\n\
  \      <p>And there’s more on the way! We can’t share all of our plans just yet,\
  \ but we <em>can</em> heavily insinuate that we don’t plan on stopping here. Watch\
  \ this space!</p>\n      <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold; line-height:\
