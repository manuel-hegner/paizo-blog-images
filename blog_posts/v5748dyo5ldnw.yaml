  \ \n   <h2>Chapter Four: The Burdens of History</h2> \n   <p>They left the midnight\
  \ mirror without speaking.</p> \n   <p>Once on the other side, safely back in the\
  \ Cathedral of Bones, Isiem snatched up the fallen shroud of silk and swept it back\
  \ over the glass. Then he sat heavily on the bed, shuddering, as Ascaros sank to\
  \ the floor beside him.</p> \n   <p>\"You can't go back,\" Isiem said.</p> \n  \
  \ <p>Ascaros did not reply. He laid his staff across his lap, thumbing its silver\
  \ adornments over and over in repetitive circles.</p> \n   <p>\"You can't,\" Isiem\
  \ repeated, more urgently. \"Silence is a trap.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Is he?\" Ascaros\
  \ asked, as if the answer were of no great concern.</p> \n   <p>\"Everything he\
  \ said was meant to bait you. His false candor, the sly promises of power, the allusions\
  \ to your predecessors' failures, even the mention that two others had refused his\
  \ offer, so that you wouldn't be tempted by pride to be the first to say no... it\
  \ is all calculated to bring you into his grasp.\"</p> \n   <p>\"My ancestor's gifts\
  \ are all curses,\" Ascaros replied. He raised his bad arm in its sling, plucking\
  \ at the linen bandages that concealed the dead gray flesh. \"He left hundreds of\
  \ children, the shae said... and of those hundreds, I am the last. What an honor.\
  \ How proud he must be.\" He shook his head bitterly. \"The sorcery in my blood\
  \ is killing me already. What does it matter, then, if Silence wants to do the same?\"\
  </p> \n   <p>\"Is that what you want? A quicker end?\"</p> \n   <p>\"No. What I\
  \ want is a way out. From all of this.\" Ascaros gestured to the cathedral's walls,\
  \ to all the decades upon decades of human bones that hemmed them in. \"Perhaps\
  \ the shae can give me that. One way or another. Failing that, I'll take a better\
  \ chance of surviving the Dusk Hall.\"</p> \n   <p>\"You don't need him for that.\"\
  </p> \n   <p>\"You don't need him for that.\" Ascaros's smile was brief and weary.\
  \ \"We've discussed this before, Isiem. You truly have no idea what the Dusk Hall\
  \ is like for someone without your gifts. It'll only get worse now that we're working\
  \ individually with the masters. You can't help me anymore. But Silence can.\"</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"Even if that help is not freely given?\" Isiem pressed. \"You would\
  \ be the same as our masters, then. Forcing another to do your will with no regard\
  \ for its own.\"</p> \n   <p>Ascaros's lips thinned. He looked away, feigning an\
  \ intense interest in the arrangement of the bones upon their door. \"I could offer\
  \ him a limited term. Ten years, then a guarantee of freedom. After millennia in\
  \ the mirror, that would be nothing to him. But for me... it might be enough to\
  \ find a way out of Mesandroth's curse. By embracing undeath, maybe. Finishing the\
  \ transformation that began before I was born.\" He shook his head in frustration.\
  \ \"I don't know if that's the right path, or if it would work. But the shae might.\"\
  </p> \n   <p>\"What about Voraic?\"</p> \n   <div class=\"blurb360\">\n    <a href=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Voraic.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Voraic_360.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    <br> The punishment for betrayal in Nidal is far worse\
  \ than death.\n   </div> \n   <p>\"We should talk to him again.\" Ascaros stood,\
  \ leaning on his staff. \"In here. I want to see him face the mirror.\"</p> \n \
  \  <p>Isiem inclined his head. He left his friend in their room and went to find\
  \ one of the Over-Diocesan's lackeys. \"Bring us the apprentice, Voraic,\" he said\
  \ when he found one. He took a seat on a bench of bones in the hallway until the\
  \ acolyte returned with the man.</p> \n   <p>Voraic looked worse than he had the\
  \ last time Isiem had seen him. His skin was almost as gray as his clothing. His\
  \ fingers trembled visibly with exhaustion; weariness had scored deep lines across\
  \ his face. And yet even through his bone-deep tiredness and guarded caution, the\
  \ fear in him was plain.</p> \n   <p>\"My time is precious,\" Voraic said as soon\
  \ as Isiem rose to greet him. \"I have work.\"</p> \n   <p>\"We won't keep you from\
  \ it for long,\" Isiem said, ushering him smoothly into the room. He locked the\
  \ door behind their guest with a quiet click.</p> \n   <p>\"What are you doing?\"\
  \ Voraic asked, turning back in alarm as Isiem turned the key. There were many locks\
  \ on their door, and Isiem turned them all.</p> \n   <p>\"Asking questions,\" Ascaros\
  \ answered coolly. He pointed the silver-capped head of his staff at the mirror\
  \ behind its veil. \"What do you know about that?\"</p> \n   <p>\"Nothing,\" Voraic\
  \ stammered. He knotted his hands together, wringing them in unconscious circles.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Ascaros gave him a thin, humorless smile. He wound the spiked chain of\
  \ his holy symbol through his fingers and folded his hands in prayer, squeezing\
  \ the barbs between his palms until both hands were studded with crimson droplets.\
  \ A pulse of magic emanated from his maimed hands, filling the room with a flare\
  \ of muddy red light and then receding. Isiem could still feel the enchantment in\
  \ the air, however, and he knew the other two could as well.</p> \n   <p>\"Try it\
  \ again,\" Ascaros said, unbinding his hand. The wounds had faded to small pink\
  \ dots. \"What do you know about the mirror?\"</p> \n   <p>Voraic's tongue flicked\
  \ out nervously to wet his lips. His hands moved faster, over and over each other,\
  \ strangling his fingers in fear. Silently his mouth moved, forming a protest that\
  \ Ascaros's spell quashed—</p> \n   <p>—no, Isiem realized in a flash of sudden\
  \ terror, that's not a lie. That's a spell.</p> \n   <p>Fire exploded at Voraic's\
  \ feet. Isiem flung himself away to escape it. In the corner of his eye, he saw\
  \ Ascaros do the same, taking cover behind the midnight mirror. It fell to the floor\
  \ with a resounding crash, although the sight was obscured behind a rush of scarlet\
  \ flames. The fireball Voraic had summoned was a sickly crimson thing, its colors\
  \ murky and uncertain.</p> \n   <p>There was nothing uncertain about its heat. The\
  \ mirror's shroud burst into flames and, almost as quickly, into ash. The bed shielded\
  \ Isiem from the worst of the explosion, but he still felt the blaze through his\
  \ clothes and the incongruously gentle drift of his own burning hair against his\
  \ cheek.</p> \n   <p>Through it all, Voraic stood still in a pillar of torment,\
  \ engulfed in clinging fire and screaming wildly as he burned. His spell had not\
  \ been directed at the shadowcallers, not really; it was meant for himself. The\
  \ agony of burning alive was nothing compared to what the Kuthite inquisitors would\
  \ do to him if he were taken alive. This was his escape.</p> \n   <p>Ascaros stopped\
  \ it. He tore one of the heavy black drapes from the walls and knocked the burning\
  \ wizard to the ground. The shadowcaller tossed the drape over Voraic and held it\
  \ down to smother the flames, adding a few kicks for good measure.</p> \n   <p>\"\
  Misery take the fool,\" he snarled, shoving a hand in through the drapes to pull\
  \ Voraic back from death's brink. Sweat and soot blackened his brow, but Ascaros's\
  \ concentration was untouched. \"Help me,\" he snapped at Isiem. \"Hurry. The Over-Diocesan's\
  \ minions will be here soon. The idiot's attempt was hardly subtle.\"</p> \n   <p>Isiem\
  \ nodded and fumbled through the drapes, ignoring his own pain. He caught hold of\
  \ the man's hands: a sticky, sloughed mess of raw flesh and bubbled skin. Several\
  \ of the fingers were gone; he couldn't tell how many. He closed his hands over\
  \ Voraic's, pressing each ruined mass into a ball, and prayed for Zon-Kuthon's cruel\
  \ mercy.</p> \n   <p>The Midnight Lord answered, and Voraic's mangled hand healed.\
  \ Isiem continued to press down, fusing the man's remaining fingers—dead or alive—\
  into the pulp of his palms. The flesh healed over itself, trapping the fingers like\
  \ flies in amber. It was an effective, if grisly, safeguard against spellcasting.\
  \ There would be no further surprises.</p> \n   <p>Slowly Voraic came back to consciousness\
  \ as the healing magic flowed through him. The flames had ruined him. One of his\
  \ eyes was gone, its socket a molten pit. His nose was a scab of charred meat pocked\
  \ by two holes. The silver hoops in his ears had been blasted into globs of bubbled\
  \ metal that dripped onto his shoulders. If he lived, he would be a monster... but\
  \ there was no one in this room, Isiem thought, who intended for him to live long.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Ascaros dug his fingers savagely into the apprentice's cheek, yanking\
  \ his face up so that their gazes met. \"What do you know about the mirror?\"</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Voraic's mouth twitched. His shoulders sank under the weight of the drapes\
  \ that still covered his body. \"I have been inside,\" he admitted in a feeble croak.\
  \ \"I have spoken to the shae.\"</p> \n   <p>Ascaros jerked his fingers, flopping\
  \ Voraic's head as though he were a fish on a hook. \"You killed my aunt at his\
  \ instigation.\"</p> \n   <p>\"No. Not at the shae's instigation.\" The wizard rolled\
  \ his good eye at the toppled mirror, staring at it without seeming to really see\
  \ it. \"Silence offered to help. He gave me the tools and the opportunity. But I\
  \ would have done it on my own eventually, with or without him.\"</p> \n   <p>\"\
  Why?\" Ascaros released his grip and stepped back. He sounded genuinely curious.\
  \ \"Misanthe saved you. She plucked you from the Hovels and gave you not just survival,\
  \ but a chance at greatness.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Should I be grateful for that? She\
  \ took me from one hell to another. A worse one, I think.\" Voraic's burned lip\
  \ curled, cracking at the edges. \"And she murdered my mother.\"</p> \n   <p>\"\
  How did you do it?\" Isiem asked.</p> \n   <p>\"Silence taught me the spell. It\
  \ was Misanthe's secret sorcery; no one knew that magic but her. Her refusal to\
  \ teach it to anyone else—even her apprentice—was famous. It was a traceless weapon,\
  \ or as near to one as I could manage.\" Voraic grimaced, shifting under the drapes\
  \ in a futile attempt to find a less painful position. \"But I would have done it\
  \ even if I'd known I would be caught.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Did he teach you anything\
  \ else?\" Ascaros demanded.</p> \n   <p>\"Yes.\" Voraic's remaining eye squinted\
  \ at the shadowcaller for a moment. Then he wheezed a strangled, mirthless sound\
  \ that might have been a laugh. \"Why, did he promise to share those secrets with\
  \ you? It's tempting, isn't it? Centuries of lore at your beck and call. He isn't\
  \ lying. He has the knowledge. But if you’re asking whether it's worth dealing with\
  \ the shae...\"</p> \n   <p>\"Is it?\"</p> \n   <p>Voraic closed his eye and let\
  \ his head loll back. The ribboned flesh of his cheek blew in and out with each\
  \ breath he took. \"Look what became of your aunt. Look what became of me. All Silence\
  \ says is true: he invites you to destruction.\"</p> \n   <p>Isiem glanced at his\
  \ friend, but Ascaros did not return his look. \"How did you get into the mirror?\"\
  \ Ascaros pressed, still intent on the apprentice. \"It only admits those of my\
  \ blood.\"</p> \n   <p>\"The blood doesn't have to be in you.\" Weakly, Voraic reached\
  \ for a blackened chain around his neck. The links had become stuck to the man's\
  \ melted flesh, but Ascaros plucked it away with callous ease. Attached to the chain\
  \ was a small vial, its glass shattered by the dying apprentice’s convulsions. A\
  \ charred rime clung to the inner surfaces of the few fragments that remained. \"\
  I wore hers, and it was enough.\"</p> \n   <p>Ascaros's face hardened. He jerked\
  \ the broken vial off Voraic's neck, snapping the damaged chain. \"Does anyone else\
  \ know this?\"</p> \n   <p>\"No. Misanthe might have suspected... but it was a routine\
  \ task for me to clean her tools after her prayers, so unless Silence told her,\
  \ she would not have known that I kept the blood, or why.\" Voraic coughed out another\
  \ miserable laugh. \"Kill me and the secret dies too. But you will have to hurry.\
  \ The Over-Diocesan's servants are coming. Give me a quick death, and I won't shout\
  \ your secret loudly enough for them to hear.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Consider it done.\"\
  \ Ascaros drew the dagger at his belt and plunged it into the empty socket of Voraic's\
  \ missing eye. The apprentice thrashed under the heavy drape, kicking spasmodically\
  \ for several seconds and then stopping.</p> \n   <p>Ascaros withdrew the dagger\
  \ and wiped it off on the thick black cloth. Before he could sheathe it, a sharp\
  \ knock sounded at their door.</p> \n   <p>\"Open,\" a woman's voice ordered, \"\
  or suffer.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Of course,\" Ascaros called back, standing. He turned\
  \ toward the door, but before he could take two steps, Isiem caught his arm.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"What will you tell them?\" Isiem whispered. He canted his head meaningfully\
  \ toward the overturned mirror. Resting lopsided on its halo of chains, the mirror\
  \ seemed almost ordinary, by the standards of Nidalese decor. Yet one needed only\
  \ a glance at its response to Ascaros's reflection to see that it was anything but.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"The truth,\" Ascaros whispered back. \"Voraic murdered my aunt as revenge\
  \ for his mother's death. She allowed him to learn the spell that he used to kill\
  \ her. He attacked us when we confronted him, and we killed him in self-defense.\
  \ The mirror is useless to anyone not of its creator's line, so there is nothing\
  \ for them to gain by taking it.\"</p> \n   <p>\"That isn't the truth,\" Isiem protested.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Another knock struck their door. This one sounded like it had been delivered\
  \ by a mailed fist, not a bare hand. \"Open.\"</p> \n   <p>\"It is,\" Ascaros hissed\
  \ back. He yanked his arm free and hurried to the door, making a noisy show of struggling\
  \ with the locks. Several had been damaged by the fiery blast, so his efforts were\
  \ not entirely feigned. \"It is true enough to pass the clerics' spells, and true\
  \ enough to keep us safe. What greater truth could you want?\"</p> \n   <p>Unable\
  \ to find an answer quickly, Isiem changed tacks. \"What of the mirror? Silence?\
  \ Do you still intend to offer him a term of ten years?\"</p> \n   <p>Ascaros hesitated.\
  \ He turned back halfway, his expression caught somewhere between desperate hope\
  \ and desperate terror. He gripped the misshapen knob of the bottom lock as tightly\
  \ as a drowning man clinging to a final frayed strand of rope.</p> \n   <p>Then\
  \ the practiced mask of stoicism slid back over his face, and he forced the last\
  \ lock free.</p> \n   <p>\"It's not your burden, Isiem,\" he said, standing aside\
  \ for the Over-Diocesan's agents to open their door. \"Silence is mine.\"</p> \n\
