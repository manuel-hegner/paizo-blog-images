                <p>We strive to use gaming to reduce the stigma around talking about suicide prevention and mental health. Tables are composed of both TTRPG streamers and auction winners who have bid for seats to play with them. We place an emphasis on having a diverse group of GMs and players and accessible tables and games.</p> 
                <p>Jasper’s Game Day is an IRS designated 501(c)(3) non-profit that raises funds for suicide prevention and awareness. Net proceeds are donated to suicide prevention and awareness charities, crisis centers, and hotlines. We use gaming to build community and spread our mission that You are Not a Critical Failure.

                <p>Greetings Starfinders,</p> 
                <p itemprop="description">Two weeks ago, we implemented tech that successfully fixed a number of issues with the Achievements Points system. While there are still some tweaks we’d like to make, the system is at a stage where we are ready to introduce Achievement Points for Starfinder Society. We’ve got a few other changes in the pipeline as well, so read on for a full explanation of what’s coming for the Starfinder Society!</p> 
                <br clear="all"> 
                <h3>New Guide to Organized Play</h3> 
                <p>Approximately two weeks before PaizoCon Online, we intend to release the new version of the Guide to Organized Play: Starfinder Society. This will be a digital guide hosted on the OPF website, much like the Pathfinder Society version. This will enable us to make changes and clarifications more rapidly, as well as make it more searchable. At this point, there are no major rules changes planned for Year 4, though we have several program changes we’ve outlined below.</p> 
                <h3>Introduction of Starfinder AcP</h3> 
                <p>Beginning <b>May 28, 2021</b>, all reported Starfinder games will earn Achievement Points (Starfinder) for the boon store. These points will be earned at the same rate as the Pathfinder Society: 4 points for players and 8 points for GMs in a 4-hour scenario. These will also be granted the 1.25x multiplier at conventions and locations under the Regional Support Program, and a 1.5x multiplier at Tier 1 conventions and Paizo-sponsored/licensed events.</p> 
                <p>AcP (Starfinder) will be used to purchase Starfinder boons in the online store, available on the Boons tab of the My Organized Play page. We’ve started publishing boons that will be ready at launch to give an idea of what will be available, and will continue to add to this list until launch.</p> 
                <p>Achievement Points for Starfinder Society will <b>not</b> be retroactive to the start of the campaign. If you played prior to this date, you already earned Fame for those scenarios, as well as additional boons for certain events. We will include an online version for each chronicle boon going forward, though paper boons in circulation are valid for use. </p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">
                 <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/3248759d-7414-446b-b50b-bd2c7f7bdc33/031121_TrainBattle.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/3248759d-7414-446b-b50b-bd2c7f7bdc33/031121_TrainBattle.jpg" width="80%" hspace="5" alt="Battle taking place on the top of a high speed train"></a>
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;"></p>
                </div> 
                <h3>Removal of Fame for Starfinder Society</h3> 
                <p>With the introduction of Achievement Points, we will be saying goodbye to the Fame system. Here are the important dates for this process.</p> 
                <p><b>Today</b>: This information is posted. Nothing changes; games played after today still earn Fame until May 28.<br> <b>May 28</b>: Games played on or after this date do not earn Fame. GMs should not award Fame, though players may still spend Fame on the boons listed in the Year 3 Guide.<br> <b>November 4</b>: In our monthly update blog, we will share information on how to convert any remaining unspent Fame to Starfinder Achievement Points.<br> <b>December 31</b>: Any unspent and unconverted Fame is lost.</p> 
                <p>Any Fame boons that are purchased between now and December 31 will function in perpetuity. We’re not taking away anything that’s already been purchased, and you will be able to use those boons as long as the SFS campaign exists.</p> 
                <h3>Why Are You Doing This?</h3> 
                <p>There are several reasons for our switch to the Achievement Points system, for both Pathfinder and Starfinder Society, and we wanted to talk about a couple of them with you.</p> 
                <p>The first reason is to encourage reporting of games. To be very frank: we rely a lot on the data we get from the reporting system. We’ve used it to influence the story of our living campaigns over the years, but lately, we’ve also been doing a fair amount of analysis on what games the community is playing, as well as when and how you all are playing them. We have found that the AcP (Pathfinder) system encourages reporting, which ensures our data is as accurate and complete as it can be. This ultimately lets us produce a better game, and it’s extremely important to Organized Play.</p> 
                <p>The second reason is equality. In the past, there were many boons that you could only get by going to a certain convention or event, which is not possible for everyone. In a global campaign, we can’t ask our Australian players to fly to Indianapolis just for the chance to play their favorite species. Even closer to home, going to a major convention is a significant expense that many can’t afford. The Achievement Points system lets everyone earn points at the same rate and spend them on what they want most. It’s another step toward being the most inclusive version of the Society that we can be.</p> 
                <h3>I Have Questions/Comments/Concerns!</h3> 
                <p>Great! That’s what this post is for.</p> 
                <p>The comments section below is open. Please treat this as an open thread for questions, because we’ll be reading and answering as many as we can. Remember the forum rules as you do so: be respectful and civil in your questions, and understand that while elements of the plan may change, there’s no argument that is going to make us totally change course. Any answers we give will be folded into either the Guide for Year 4 or the Starfinder Society FAQ page as appropriate, so you’re not having to cite random forum comments for clarifications.</p>

                <p>There are many different intersections between autism and gaming. In this blog, we’re highlighting the personal experience of three individuals associated with Game to Grow: a client who uses the program, the volunteer coordinator of Game to Grow, and one of their trainees. We thank each of them for sharing their stories with our gaming community. Game to Grow founder and Executive Director Adam Davis and his staff have created supporting and nurturing environments for all players, as well as developing training for Game Masters and industry professionals to support individuals with autism.

                <p>For this occasion, I’d love to talk about autistic representation in games or the benefits of role-playing games to neurodiverse people—but, being autistic with a penchant for deep dives into subjects of interest, there is no way I can satisfactorily cover that in the 500 odd words available. Instead, I’m going to share a simple but effective intervention that can be used at any table, and which can have a big positive impact for all players, with some unique advantages for autistic ones. Full credit to the wonderful folks over at Game to Grow, who taught most of my group this technique when we were attending a therapeutic GM training</p> 
                <p>In my wonderful roleplaying group, we start each session with a check-in question asked by the GM. This can be literally almost anything—last time we played it <em>was what is your favorite bird</em>? But it could just as well have been <em>what’s a childhood memory you would like to change? Or if you could have a conversation with anyone at all, who would you choose?</em></p> 
                <p>We, the players, answer for ourselves, and—when applicable—also for our characters. Depending on the question, the insights here can be profound, intriguing, or hilarious. Our dwarf barbarian’s favorite bird is a sparrow because <em>they’re small, a bit grungy, and always willing to take on something bigger than themselves</em>, much like him. </p> 
                <p>When we have put down the dice for the evening, everyone answers two more questions, and these are the same every session. First, everyone gives a highlight to another player for making their session awesome, and second—this one is the kicker—everyone shares something that was challenging about the session, or something they’ve learned.</p> 
                <p>So why is this a good thing for me as an autistic gamer?</p> 
                <p>Firstly, this ritual creates a social space where it is not only allowed but <em>encouraged</em> for every player to share their unique perspective on the game, and to express when something has been difficult. For me as an autistic who sometimes needs to ask for support or accommodation, this helps level the playing field, so to speak, and creates a structured way for me to express things that are challenging when they happen. The repetitive nature and timing of the questions also help me feel less anxious about speaking up in a social context. Finally, asking and answering these questions facilitates honest, authentic communication, which is not only great for me as an autistic who struggles with small talk and polite pretense, but in a very real way brings the whole group closer together. Some of the best times we’ve had as a group have been the hour-long conversations after the sessions, which grow organically out of the tone and intention set by the check-in and -out questions.</p> 
                <p>All told, it’s an exercise in connection and trust which helps me as an autistic bridge the gap that can sometimes be present between myself and neurotypical fellow players and feel like an equal and valued member of the group. For me, that’s the best part. </p>

                <br> 
                <p>Saroc the Bard is an excellent negotiator. I, on the other hand, am not. Saroc the Bard is an amazing wordsmith. I continually struggle to find the right expressions. Playing RPGs has helped me understand Autism and myself by teaching me better conversation skills, self-advocacy, and learning social cues. For my entire life, it has been difficult for me to have a decent conversation with people as I have a tendency to ramble. Playing RPGs has helped me get better at the balance of back and forth talking that good conversations require and neurotypical people take for granted. Various RPGs have also taught me how important and easy it is to stand up for myself. By practicing in the controlled environment of an RPG, I have learned to have the confidence to tell someone how I am truly feeling or to stop them when they’ve interrupted me. I have also learned how to identify certain social cues, like when someone wants to talk, or is feeling uncomfortable. </p> 
                <p>Living with Autism has given me a unique ability to do some things that other people find difficult, like finding solutions from multiple angles. Having these abilities has come at a social and emotional cost. Though it is easy for me to make friends, it’s often difficult for me to be aware of how my behavior affects them. I have often felt alone, even when I’m with my friends. But playing RPGs has helped me find people like me; I don’t have to deal with Autism by myself. I have been able to see the positives in what I am capable of doing, instead of focusing on the negatives of what I’m incapable of doing. Playing RPGs has made coping with the chaos of the world much easier by giving me problems I am easily able to solve. Because of this, I am able to find solutions to my real-world problems.</p> 
                <p>Autism is a spectrum disorder, and even two people with the same diagnosis, like Asperger’s, process the world very differently. RPGs allow for a wide variety of characters; thus, anyone can find a character that fits them. Something that is amazing about RPGs is that people can write the backstories for their characters. Being able to include skills my character has that I’ve wanted has made learning those skills easier, like communicating, negotiating, and self-respect. Learning these skills in a group that won’t judge me for making mistakes has made playing more fun and enjoyable. Since I started playing Saroc 4 years ago, I have learned, quite honestly, to love myself.</p>

                <p>My name is Shawna Spain, but my online handle is likesevenspoon. I was diagnosed as Autistic in my mid-twenties, and my reactions were a mix of relief that I knew what was wrong with me, finally, and a kind of anger that my brain was so different that I couldn't be "normal." It's been about a decade, and I finally don't feel a desire to be normal—I am happy being me. I am pretty awesome. </p> 
                <p>When I was first diagnosed, my doctor encouraged me to engage in structured social activities and when I was like, how even do you do that, he suggested I invite people over for board games. So, I joined a TTRPG game, and played board games with people and felt a comfort in those interactions because there are RULES. And everyone just agrees to follow them. Which is like real life, except unlike real life, the rules for these games are written down. Which is awesome. I finally found a world where my brain was less of a hindrance and more of a great thing. </p> 
                <p>I am a great storyteller, and the framework of the game gives me a place to relax and have energy to tell those stories. That means a lot to me. I can exist in a space for all humans and have fun and meaningful relationships. I can be successful at things, learn things, and play. For someone who grew up branded a weirdo, made fun of for the way I talked, got into fights when someone called me stupid, this is a whole new world. I belong alongside all of these other humans who want to play a game and participate in the collaborative telling of a story. I can practice skill sets that I can use in other parts of my life. After all, being the GM of a game is often using skills that a manager would need in their real-life job. Think about it. There are objectives, and you need to get a group of people to complete them. You need to make it engaging and fun and set everyone up to be a success. Same skill set. </p> 
                <p>I want more people to play TTRPGs. I want them to be safe spaces for the Neurodivergent community. I want more Autistics to be able to learn the same things I have, and feel the same confidence, and find friends and joy.</p>

               <blockquote> 
                <p itemprop="description">“Annnd with a terrifying tail whip to the jaw, the Taiga Tyrant is down! She’ll be feeling <em>that</em> in the morning! Our winner is the Summer Swordsman of Ekkeshikaar!”</p> 
                <p>Cheers resounded through the stadium as the announcer floated high above, her voice booming. Triangular pennants lowered in defeat from one corner of the arena, as triumphant sunflower bouquets showered down from another.</p> 
                <p>Lei took in the sights and sounds as she walked the arena, steaming basket in both hands. Usually, she parked the cart outside to cook buns while her daughter worked the crowd, but the scamp had run off to “scope out the competition at the exhibition matches.” She’d suspiciously taken enough to feed both her and her two friends, and she’d been gone for hours. Now, Lei was selling buns herself, but to be honest, it was a welcome change to be inside the arena even if the stairs were doing a number on her knees. </p> 
                <p>“Speaking of, if you want to <em>not</em> feel that in the morning, that last match was sponsored by Plum Rain’s plum wine! For a deluge of flavor and a clear-sky taste, try Plum Rain today!” the announcer chirped as attendants ran out to sweep the arena and recover the few remaining non-vaporized pieces of the Taiga Tyrant’s spear.</p> 
                <p>“Auntie! Two char siu, two black sugar! Make it fast!” a young man in a feathered hat, clearly a merchant, called from a small throng around a nearby railing. As Lei ambled over, her eye caught on a pile of coins, and next to it, a bespectacled priest with a ledger and slate. Wagers on the tournament, then. She opened her basket and passed out the orders, collecting a few blade-shaped coins in payment.</p> 
                <p>“Fancy a bet?” the young merchant asked.</p> 
                <p>Lei didn’t usually indulge, but she caught a glance of the next two contestants readying themselves. In one corner a lean Vudrani monk in blue performed a series of warm-up stretches, and in the other, a young green-clad warrior paced back and forth. Lei took a closer look and played the match out in her mind. Why not? “Blue holds upper hand for seven moves, then Green wins in three.” Lei put down the coins she’d just collected on the railing. </p> 
                <p>The merchant laughed into his bun. “Maybe you’ve been too busy baking to actually catch the fights, but that guy’s been trouncing his competition all day. The girl’s just some initiate out of Indapatta, not even fully graduated. I couldn’t possibly take such a bet from someone of your...” He looked at Lei’s stained apron, “...means.”</p> 
                <p>Well, no mercy then. The baker dumped her earnings for the day out onto the railing. “Three <em>consecutive</em>.”</p> 
                <p>The merchant closed his mouth, opened it, and elected to take a bite instead. “You know what, it’s your coin. I meet and accept whatever odds the Ministry sees suitable. Witness?”</p> 
                <p>The priest nodded. “The Ministry of Numbers and Fortune recognizes this wager and sets eight-to-one odds for the skilled baker, pursuant Article 3.51.01 of the Gambling Code. By Abadar’s gaze, the deal is sealed.” The Ministry’s judgement was as impartial as it was absolute.</p> 
                <p>The peppy human megaphone floating above the arena clapped her hands. “Ladies and gentlemen, now that the staff has finished disarming the ice snares from that last match—at least, most of them, I think—it’s about time to make like a sky chariot and get this show on the air! Contestants, take your places, and let fate guide your fists!”</p> 
                <p>“Ready?”</p> 
                <p>Lei smiled. By the end of the day, she’d be sitting in a fine hotel room overlooking the bay, with one of those luxurious balcony baths to soak her knee in.</p> 
                <p>“Fight!”</p>

                </div> 
                <p>The man let out a roar and opened his fingers into a clawlike form before leaping forward.</p> 
                <p>“Southern Panther,” Lei and the merchant muttered in unison, before their eyes met with a smile. It was always nice when the competition knew their stuff. The monk blazed his way across the ground, and the other warrior barely blocked the strike, catching a slash across the cheekbone. He followed up with a swift flurry of attacks, and the initiate didn’t fare much better, barely turning away each.</p> 
                <p>“Two moves to Blue.”</p> 
                <p>“He has the advantage in speed,” the merchant said, and Lei didn’t argue—the girl was outclassed. She tried some sort of spinning backhand, but her opponent ducked easily and whirled around before delivering a series of palm strikes that shone with silver light.</p> 
                <p>“Moves three and four to Blue.”</p> 
                <p>“Good qi control as well,” the merchant observed. </p> 
                <p>“Coating his strikes for extra impact,” Lei agreed.</p> 
                <p>The girl leapt in the air to try a kick, but the monk brought his silvered fists together, releasing the energy in a ripple that blasted upward and caught the initiate in the jaw. Her momentum halted, he sent her reeling back with an uppercut. From there, it was simple for him to knock her to the ground with a sweeping kick of his own.</p> 
                <p>“Five, six, and seven to Blue.”</p> 
                <p>Rather than pressing the attack on a downed opponent, though, he waited. One of those warriors’ codes, no doubt. The initiate’s chest rose and fell once, and Lei felt like she could hear it even over the crowd’s roar. </p> 
                <p>“He shouldn’t have let her catch her breath,” Lei said, leaning forward in her seat.</p> 
                <p>“What’s the harm?”</p> 
                <p>The girl in green leapt up, full of energy once more, like she hadn’t just spent the last minute knocked about by one of the top fighters on the continent. She swung, and though the monk brought his arm up, her fist accelerated mid-hook, snaking around his guard like a leaf on the wind. She connected with his jaw, driving him twenty paces back, to wild cheers.</p> 
                <p>“You said some school in Indapatta? That uniform’s the Academy of Golden Arms, and that’s their signature technique—cycling their breath through their organs to generate elemental energy. Air brings… speed and flexibility, I believe.” Lei suppressed a smile. “You’re probably too young to remember the last time there was Golden Arm in the tournament.”</p> 
                <p>“After seven moves in Blue’s favor, one to Green.”</p> 
                <p>The monk had regained his footing, but the other warrior raised her fist and wind spiraled. Another exhalation brought an eruption of lightning, crackling and splitting into four strands that shot in each cardinal direction. The electricity speared toward the audience, but it crashed against transparent walls of power cast by the Grand Judge herself, Hao Jin. The audience gasped, and for one great moment, tens of thousands in the Grand Arena—young and old, from all across Golarion, many not even sharing a language—were united as their attention hung in this one moment.</p> 
                <p>This… <em>this</em> was why Lei loved the Ruby Phoenix Tournament. Not for the fights, not for the fun, not even for the business it brought her little food cart. This.</p> 
                <p>The lightning spears converged into a single great lance pointed at the monk, who crossed his bracers and met the attack valiantly. Sparks splashed about him, and the glow around his wrists betrayed that his focus was now solely on defense. The blast pushed him back even as he defended, and his foot slipped ever so slightly on the sand. His center of balance tipped.</p> 
                <p>“Two to Green.” The merchant wiped his brow.</p> 
                <p>As the storm abated and the monk moved to correct his footing and resume his attack, his opponent snapped her hand back with a gasp of power. A pulse, and the monk’s arms—or rather, his bracers—jerked toward her, and with no grounded stance, there was precious little to stop him from flying forward. </p> 
                <p>“Our initiate’s lightning technique has magnetized the bracers on our silent, handsomely chiseled fighter, and she’s drawing him closer at extreme speed!” the announcer blathered. “I wonder if she’ll teach me that in time for ballroom season!”</p> 
                <p>The girl planted her feet, twisted her hips, and drove her fist forward with all her might, delivering a single punch to the monk’s sternum as he flew into her at breakneck speed.</p> 
                <p>The match was over.</p> 
                <p>“Seven moves at Blue’s advantage, followed by victory in three consecutive by Green. The baker has it.” The magistrate’s fingers moved on an imaginary abacus before he swiftly divided out all but a tiny portion of the coins and passed them to Lei. The merchant stared slack-jawed. Lei opened her basket, and seeing there was only one bun left, she put it in the merchant’s mouth before scooping his money in—it was the least she could do.</p> 
                <p>She turned out of the arena. She’d close up a bit early today, and tomorrow, she and her daughter would take the day off to catch some matches from a proper arena seat. </p> 
                <p>Now, to see about that hotel room, the one with the balcony bath.</p>

                <h3>About the Cast</h3> 
                <h4>Troy Lavallee</h4> 
                <p>Troy Lavallee is the co-founder and CEO of The Glass Cannon Network. His adventures in role-playing began in the mid-90s with Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2nd Edition. After a 20 year hiatus from tabletop gaming, his love for the hobby was furiously rekindled when introduced to Pathfinder in 2011. After receiving an MFA in Acting from Columbia University in 2003, Troy spent the better part of two decades pounding the pavement as an actor, writer, producer and stand-up comedian in New York City. The Glass Cannon Network was born out of a love not only for gaming but for using the collaborative nature of RPGs to create epic serialized stories that have the potential to rival anything on Network television. Troy is the primary Gamemaster for the Network but also plays several characters on their Patreon exclusive shows considered both highly entertaining and GM nightmares that would never be allowed in home games. You can follow Troy on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/troylavallee/" target="_blank">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/troylavallee" target="_blank">Twitter</a> at @troylavallee</p> 
                <h4>Noura Ibrahim</h4> 
                <p>Noura is an actor and live streamer. She has played Jahan in the mobile app game Ingress by Niantic Labs (makers of Pokemon Go!) and has made worldwide in-character appearances at Anomaly events. As a live steamer, you can find her playing Nahara on the new official Dungeons and Dragons show Black Dice Society. Noura is best known for her role as Ib on the Vampire The Masquerade chronicle LA By Night, as well as Ezmerelda D’Avenir on Realmsmith’s Curse of Strahd campaign Into The Mist. She appears as Jasmine on the all Princess D&amp;D show Damsels, Dice and Everything Nice on Pixel Circus, and as Nox Arya on Cyberpunk Red GM’ed by Cyberpunk creator Mike Pondsmith. She can also occasionally be found streaming Call of Cthulhu, World of Darkness, and other ttrpg systems on QueueTimes, The Glass Cannon Network, and Stream of Blood. Noura earned her black belt in Kuk Sool Won while living in South Korea where she also studied horseback riding and became a member of The Korean Archers Association …because who doesn’t want to be a real life action hero?</p> 
                <h4>Alica Marie</h4> 
                <p>"TTRPG Addict" Alicia Marie is a costume artist and designer, author (The Booty Bible), accessibility awareness advocate and fitness pro who turned her love of super-physiques, comic books, video game and fantasy art into a creative career. Most known for her classic costume nods to Mortal Kombat, Star Trek and Marvel superheros, Alicia, who calls herself a “compulsive maker,” creates character looks for media companies like Warner Brothers, Netflix, Amazon Prime and for game developers like Netherrealm (Mortal Kombat) and Gearbox (Borderlands). She has also designed character looks for celebrity clients such as platinum recording artist Megan Thee Stallion and WWE superstar Ronda Rousey. Alicia is the physical inspiration for some of the fighting characters you see in popular video games. In May, she was introduced as a playable character in Sony Interactive/Illfonic’s new game PREDATOR: Hunting Grounds. Alicia, who likes to refer to herself as “walking technology” or a “cyborg” following cochlear implant surgery to restore her ability to hear speech and sound, is also a voice for accessibility for the deaf and hard-of hearing. When she isn’t working on a new costume-look, you can find Alicia at the gym, or of course, playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons or other RPG systems LIVE on Twitch. You can follow Alicia on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/AliciaMarieBODY/" target="_blank">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/AliciaMarieBODY" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@aliciamariebody?lang=en" target="_blank">TikTok</a> at @AliciaMarieBODY</p> 
                <h4>Skid Maher</h4> 
                <p>Skid has been nerding it up since 1982, when his uncle Sinclair gifted him the Basic D&amp;D set (the Tom Moldvay edition) for his ninth birthday. It was all downhill from there, as he subsequently dabbled in such classic games as Champions, Gamma World, Judge Dredd RPG, Ghostbusters RPG, Robotech RPG, Top Secret, Tunnels and Trolls, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles RPG (before it was a stupid cartoon), Middle Earth Role-Playing, Beyond the Supernatural, Twilight 2000, Price of Freedom, Mechwarrior, and Traveller. Nowadays he spends most of his time developing gaming and media projects with the Mozzlestead production company, and obsessively watching Ralph Bakshi's Lord of the Rings. He also had a letter read on Late Night with David Letterman, and was briefly a very minor celebrity on Japanese TV. Oh, and once he saw a blimp.</p> 
                <h4>Joe O’Brien</h4> 
                <p>Joe O’Brien is the Co-Founder and COO of the Glass Cannon Network. He began playing Pathfinder in 2011 and has a special place in his nerd heart for the systems and the adventures published by Paizo. On the Glass Cannon Network, Joe has been the GM for Pathfinder Society Scenarios, and a Pathfinder Second Edition conversion of The Emerald Spire Superdungeon. Currently, you can hear him as a player on The Glass Cannon Podcast, Raiders of the Lost Continent, and Legacy of the Ancients, all playing Pathfinder First Edition Adventure Paths. You can also catch him on Twitch or YouTube as a cast member on Androids &amp; Aliens (an official Starfinder Actual Play), Glass Cannon Live!, New Game, Who Dis? (Cyberpunk Red, Alien RPG (Game Mother), Call of Cthulhu), and Blood &amp; Blades: The Tin Whistles (a shared-universe tabletop experience playing Blades in the Dark produced by Stream of Blood). He is the Handler on Get in the Trunk, a Delta Green Actual Play Podcast Series produced by the Glass Cannon Network. He is excited to work directly with several members of the Paizo team on this project who, over the years, have consistently reinforced the respect and admiration he has for the love that goes into their work. He hopes to one day play in a Pathfinder game where, in a pivotal moment, with his companions relying on him, he can roll anything above a 5. He won’t hold his breath, though. For Highbury!</p> 
                <p>Don’t miss the first <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/standalone/pfOneShots">Pathfinder One-Shot: Sundered Waves</a> adventure and the liveplay.</p> 
                <p>We’re excited to see you all on Saturday, May 29 at 6 p.m. Pacific at <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/officialpaizo" target="_blank">twitch.tv/officialpaizo</a>!</p>

                <p>The Shrine tiles are dedicated to Pathfinder Deities who are watching the heroes’ struggles in the Arena. Heroes can increase their charisma and reach a Shrine Tile to be the chosen of such Deities. Each Deity grants a different bonus.</p> 
                <p>The next important update concerns the monsters’ cards of the core set. We showed in the last update all the eighteen miniatures finished and now their profiles are ready too. </p> 
                <p>Each monster can have a close and a ranged attack. If a monster takes by surprise a hero, its damages’ output increase dramatically. The most powerful monsters have special abilities, allowing them to reach heroes even behind a corner or a wall, regenerate themselves, destroy heroes’ objects. You can see all the monsters’ cards and the Shrine Tiles <a href="https://www.giochiunitiinternational.com/pathfinder-arena/">in the Official Page</a> of the project. </p> 
                <p>In the last update we shared the news of the second survey aimed to the community: twelve monsters were voted to be included in the second expansion. Here are the winners of each tier:</p> 
                <ul style="list-style-type:none;"> 
                 <li>Tier1: Goblin Pyro (a group of 2-3 miniatures)</li> 
                 <li>Tier 2: Gargoyle</li> 
                 <li>Tier 3: Nightmare</li> 
                 <li>Tier 4: Mummy Pharaoh</li> 
                </ul> 
                <p>One last survey is now online and it is on our Day1 bonus. Once the crowdfunding campaign will kick-off, the day 1 backers will get one amazing miniature of a Dragon for free and it is up to you choose which one!</p> 
                <p>The possibilities are: Young Red Dragon, Young Black Dragon, Young Blue Dragon, Young Green Dragon</p> 
                <p>Join the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/403722200813208">Facebook group</a> to vote for your favorite dragon and your future day1 bonus!</p> 
                <p>The crowdfunding date is yet to be determined, as well as the platform hosting it. Subscribe to the <a href="https://www.giochiunitiinternational.com/pathfinder-arena/">Pathfinder Arena webpage</a> to be updated on this project and be notified of the crowdfunding campaign. </p>

                <p>We’ve long had partnerships with Astral, d20Pro, Fantasy Grounds, and Roll20, and each continues to support both our games to varying degrees. Starting today, we also offer <a href="https://paizo.com/store/gaming/accessories/virtualTableTop/foundryVirtualTabletop">premium content for Foundry Virtual Tabletop as well</a>.

                <p>You can purchase the <a href="https://paizo.com/store/gaming/accessories/virtualTableTop/foundryVirtualTabletop">first five Pathfinder Bounties for $5 each right now</a>, and we’re looking into how we can add more great Foundry-compatible modules in the future! These are something of a test for us, as they’re converted internally (rather than by someone at Foundry Virtual Tabletop) and are hosted here on the Paizo store. Let us know how the process works and what other premium content you’d like to see and we’ll build out a plan to expand our offerings.</p> 
                <p>We’re continuing to look into our options for getting more accessories like item cards, pawn/token sets, and other products you’ve all come to expect from both Pathfinder and Starfinder onto our various VTT partners’ stores, so let us know what you want to see and we’ll try to make it happen.</p> 
                <p>Regardless of how much longer we’re all living under the restrictions of the pandemic, VTTs are here to stay, and we want to make it as easy as possible for you to enjoy our many Pathfinder and Starfinder products on them for years to come.</p>

                <p><b>By Vanessa Hoskins</b></p> 
                <h3>Zhang Yong, Spirit Tender</h3> 
                <p itemprop="description">In the great fighting tournaments across Tian Xia, a competitor will occasionally perish in the heat of battle. Sometimes their lust for battle, desire to win, or enduring competitive spirit lingers, often resulting in a haunting. When this happens, it’s up to a ghost eater to defeat the lingering soul to send it to the afterlife.</p> 
                <p>Ten years ago, during the previous Ruby Phoenix Tournament, Yong was a boy of 13 years working as a water carrier, though he dreamed of one day fighting in the tournament and making a name for himself, especially to set him apart from his many accomplished human, orc, and half-orc cousins. Yong imagined showing the world his skill, determination, and fierce grasp on life and excelling at something all his own. That very grasp saved his life when an errant undead specter disrupted a match, tearing through the ringside where Yong was carrying water. Though he was gravely injured in the incident, Yong was brought into the care of the tournament’s resident ghost eater and, from her, learned how to fight the corruption of lingering souls.</p> 
                <p>Now, Yong is one of the tournament’s most renown ghost eaters, tasked with cleansing any haunts, ghosts, or spiritual phenomena that remain after a particularly grueling battle. Though he sometimes shudders at the memory of that terrifying day ten years ago, through sheer determination, he carries on, finding that in guiding these souls to rest, he’s found not just a way to purge the ghosts of his own past, but a rare talent as a spirit tender, one all his own.</p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/49996c94-6839-45cb-a766-eb7d66beb5a4/042321_ZhangYong.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/49996c94-6839-45cb-a766-eb7d66beb5a4/042321_ZhangYong.jpg" align="left" width="450" style="padding: 10px;" alt="A male half-orc is dressed in silken robes and has his leg and arm raised in a martial arts pose, the glow of a mystical force surrounding his rag-wrapped foot.]"></a>

If he critically failed on the triggering saving throw, he also takes 2d6 persistent mental damage and cannot use this ability again while taking persistent mental damage.</p> 
                <p><b>Speed</b> 45</p> 
                <p><b>Melee</b> [one-action] soul strike +23 (agile, finesse, nonlethal, unarmed), Damage 2d8+14 bludgeoning (plus 1d6 lawful against chaotic targets)</p> 
                <p><b>Ranged</b> [one-action] greater ghost charge +23 (range 10 feet, thrown), Damage 3d8 positive plus 3 positive splash damage</p> 
                <p><b>Disrupting Strikes</b> [one-action] Yong calls forth positive energy from within to help him destroy undead. His weapons and unarmed Strikes gain the effects of a <em>greater disrupting</em> property rune until the start of his next turn (DC 31).</p> 
                <p><b>Reach Beyond</b> Yong has learned to move his spiritual energy past himself to attack spirits where others can’t. He can make melee Strikes against incorporeal creatures that are inside solid objects as long as the object is within his reach. An incorporeal creature inside of a solid object is hidden, requiring him to succeed at a DC 11 flat check when he targets it. He can spend an action, which has the concentrate trait, to focus on a creature inside of a solid object. If he does, the next melee Strike he makes this turn requires him to succeed at only a DC 6 flat check to affect the creature.</p> 
                <p><b>Soul Dance Stance</b> [one-action] Yong begins a stance that aligns him with the River of Souls, allowing him to make soul strike attacks that seem almost incorporeal. These deal 1d8 bludgeoning damage; are in the brawling group; and have the agile, finesse, nonlethal, and unarmed traits. Soul strikes treat cover against living and incorporeal undead targets as degree less severe (greater cover becomes standard cover, standard cover becomes lesser cover, and lesser cover is ignored).</p> 
                <h4>Plot Hooks</h4> 
                <p>Game Masters can use the following plot hooks to integrate Zhang Yong into their ongoing Pathfinder campaigns.</p> 
                <ul> 
                 <li>The players’ competitors could be having trouble with a particularly powerful haunt or ghost disrupting a practice space and wish to seek Yong’s aid to purge it.</li> 
                 <li>The competitors hear of Yong’s childhood trauma, and how those memories cause him distress today. They may wish to help the young man face those fears and move past the pain.</li> 
                 <li>The ghost of Yong’s former master has risen for this decade’s Ruby Phoenix Tournament, thinking she is still the head ghost eater. Yong is having trouble facing his old master alone and seeks the players’ competitors for guidance and assistance sending his old master safely to Pharasma’s court.</li> 
                </ul>

                <p itemprop="description">With <a href="http://www.paizo.com/paizocon">PaizoCon Online</a> coming up and Year 3 on the horizon, we thought we’d take a moment to talk about how to create a Pathfinder Society character and show you the different options available to players. I’ve got my friends “Zonya” and “Minda” here to help me out; any resemblance to actual persons with whom I work is purely coincidental, I <em>assure</em> you.</p> 
                <p>For this blog, we’ll be following the steps outlined in the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01zp3?Pathfinder-Core-Rulebook">Pathfinder Core Rulebook</a> as well as the <a href="https://organizedplayfoundation.org/Lorespire/pfs2guide._.Character-Creation">Character Creation section of the Guide to Organized Play</a>. </p> 
                <h3>Available Character Options</h3> 
                <p>Pathfinder uses a system of rarity to describe how widespread its rules options are in the game world. When building your character, be sure to check the <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/characteroptions">Pathfinder Society Character Options page</a>, which describes how this rarity system applies in Pathfinder Society. This page lists all of the books that have rules you can use for your character, and details which rules are available to you. It also provides some rules clarifications and other useful information. </p> 
                <p>The Character Options page also lists the rules for owning copies of the books. Generally, in order to use options from a book outside the Core Sources (the <em>Core Rulebook</em>, <em>Pathfinder Bestiary</em> and the <em>Lost Omens World Guide</em>), you must own the book where the option is published. However, playing some adventures grants boons that let you use the options from that adventure without owning the book.</p> 
                <p>Many Uncommon or Rare options require a boon which can either be earned as a result of playing a particular adventure or purchasing the boon with Achievement Points. Players/GMs earn Achievement Points every time they play/run a game; if you’re looking for a quick way to boost your AcP, join games at conventions, which grant bonus AcP. Games run at a local game store or other event may also grant this bonus; check with the event’s organizer to see if they qualify.</p>

                <h3>Creating a Concept</h3> 
                <p>Each of our three players have arrived at their concepts differently. You can start wherever you like to find a concept: pick a class or ancestry you’d like to try, a spell or ability you want to build around, or just find inspiration in another fictional character!</p> 
                <p><b>Zonya</b> is a seasoned Pathfinder Society (first edition) player, and wants to make the jump to second edition to play with her friends. She knows she wants to play a typical Pathfinder who upholds the core tenets of the Society: Explore, Report and Cooperate.</p> 
                <p><b>Alex</b> recently picked up the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq023ih?Pathfinder-Advanced-Players-Guide">Advanced Player’s Guide</a> and is enamored by the <a href="http://2e.aonprd.com/Classes.aspx?ID=14" target="_blank">Oracle</a> options. He thinks they’re fun and full of flavor and looks forward to playing up the curse drawbacks. He also has a ton of Achievement Points, which he earned from playing and GMing Pathfinder Society games, so he’s looking to spend some of them on some options.</p> 
                <p><b>Minda</b> only plays <a href="http://2e.aonprd.com/Ancestries.aspx?ID=14" target="_blank">leshys</a>, it’s sort of her staple. Looking through the new <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq026k5?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Ancestry-Guide"><em>Lost Omens Ancestry Guide</em></a>, she sees the art of the fruit leshy and decides she wants to use it as inspiration.</p> 
                <h3>The ABCs of Character Building</h3> 
                <p>Next, our players are going to select their ABCs: Ancestry, Background and Class. These are the basic building blocks of any character; more information can be found in Chapter 1 of the Pathfinder Core Rulebook. </p> 
                <p>Zonya had an orc character she loved to play in Pathfinder Society (First Edition), so she’s going to build his daughter using the <a href="http://2e.aonprd.com/Ancestries.aspx?ID=8">half-orc heritage</a>. To build for exploration, she decides this character is a <a href="http://2e.aonprd.com/Classes.aspx?ID=9">ranger</a> with an <a href="http://2e.aonprd.com/AnimalCompanions.aspx">animal companion</a>, with an eye to taking the <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Feats.aspx?ID=1292">Ferocious Beasts</a> feat later. She’s also considering the <a href="http://2e.aonprd.com/Archetypes.aspx?ID=13">Pathfinder Agent Archetype</a> for second level, to signify the character’s devotion to the Pathfinder Society. It is an Uncommon archetype, but she sees it’s legal for all characters on the <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/characteroptions">Character Options page</a>. For the background, she considers <a href="http://2e.aonprd.com/Backgrounds.aspx?ID=20">Herbalist</a>, but eventually settles on <a href="http://2e.aonprd.com/Backgrounds.aspx?ID=32">Scout</a>, deciding that as a Strength-based ranger, she wants to spend more time ahead of the group in case of an ambush.</p> 
                <p>Alex is looking through the <a href="https://paizo.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/Store.woa/wa/browse?path=organizedPlay/myAccount/rewards#tabs">Boons section</a> of his My Organized Play page, and decides that the time has come to purchase his <a href="http://2e.aonprd.com/Ancestries.aspx?ID=17">Catfolk Ancestry boon</a>. He registers the new character and purchases the boon, downloading a copy to save for his records. As a <a href="http://2e.aonprd.com/Mysteries.aspx?ID=5">Flames Mystery Oracle</a>, this character is looking to have excellent Reflex saves and Acrobatics, so he decides to lean into that, taking the <a href="http://2e.aonprd.com/Feats.aspx?ID=2315">Catfolk Dance feat</a> and the <a href="http://2e.aonprd.com/Heritages.aspx?ID=92">Flexible Catfolk Heritage</a>. For Background, he goes with the <a href="http://2e.aonprd.com/Backgrounds.aspx?ID=2">Acrobat</a> background, flavoring this character as a former performer who blended their flames and acrobatic prowess to entertain the crowds.</p> 
                <p>Minda is very familiar with the process to purchase the Leshy Ancestry boon from her <a href="https://paizo.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/Store.woa/wa/browse?path=organizedPlay/myAccount/rewards#tabs">Boons page</a>, and can practically do it in her sleep. Because <a href="http://2e.aonprd.com/Heritages.aspx?ID=100">fruit leshys</a> produce fruit which heals, she decides to make them a <a href="http://2e.aonprd.com/Classes.aspx?ID=5">Cleric</a> to focus on healing. She’d love to worship a <a href="http://2e.aonprd.com/Deities.aspx?ID=221">Green Man</a>, but unfortunately <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027mn?Pathfinder-Bestiary-3"><em>Bestiary 3</em></a> isn’t available yet on the <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/characteroptions">Character Options page</a>. Instead, she decides her deity is <a href="http://2e.aonprd.com/Deities.aspx?ID=8">Gozreh</a>. A character can be fully rebuilt until they’re played at level 2, so if Bestiary 3 is sanctioned soon, she might switch! As a <a href="http://2e.aonprd.com/Doctrines.aspx?ID=2">Cloistered Cleric</a>, she gains the <a href="http://2e.aonprd.com/Feats.aspx?ID=265">Domain Initiate Feat</a> so she can get <a href="http://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=467">Vibrant Thorns</a> from the <a href="http://2e.aonprd.com/Domains.aspx?ID=22">Nature domain</a>; it’s an Uncommon Spell, but the Feat grants her access.</p> 
                <p>The three players finish filling out their character sheets and purchase equipment following the steps in the <em>Core Rulebook</em>. At this point, they have complete Pathfinder characters, but Pathfinder Society adds a couple of extra choices to make prior to your first game.</p> 
                <h3>Society Training and Factions</h3> 
                <p>To represent a character’s involvement with the Society, each character selects a <a href="https://organizedplayfoundation.org/Lorespire/pfs2guide._.Character-Creation#Membership_in_the_Pathfinder_Society">Pathfinder Training option</a>. These options provide <a href="https://organizedplayfoundation.org/Lorespire/pfs2guide._.Player-Basics#Table_4-1_School_Consumables">additional consumables</a> at the beginning of each scenario, or in the case of a Field Commissioned agent, additional Downtime after each scenario.</p> 
                <p>Zonya’s half-orc ranger heard about the Society in stories from her parents growing up. As a result, Zonya decides to reflect this by taking the Scrolls training, which grants Pathfinder Society Lore. She also plans to get some good use out of the <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=90"><em>eagle-eye elixir</em></a> she’ll get for free each scenario.</p> 
                <p>Alex goes back and forth, but eventually elects to make his catfolk oracle a Field Commissioned agent. This will give him more Downtime to Earn Income with his Circus Lore, and he takes the Mercantile Lore as his bonus. </p> 
                <p>Minda trains her leshy cleric with the Spells school, figuring that there’s never a wrong time to have an extra scroll of <em>heal</em> on hand, just in case. She takes the Herbalism Lore the school offers as well.</p> 
                <p><a href="https://organizedplayfoundation.org/Lorespire/pfs2guide._.The-World-of-Golarion#Factions">Factions</a> represent special interests within the Pathfinder Society. Characters don’t have to choose just one faction; at the beginning of each session, you’ll choose what faction to champion and earn reputation for at that table. Still, it’s good to look over the factions and pick the one you’ll likely spend the most time representing.</p> 
                <p>For our three sample characters, Zonya chooses the <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/factions/horizon-hunters">Horizon Hunters</a> for her ranger and Minda naturally chooses the <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/factions/verdant-wheel">Verdant Wheel</a> for her leshy. Alex is unsure, as none of the Factions feel perfectly correct, so he’ll take the opportunity to let his character meet the faction leaders in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01znb?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-101-The-Absalom-Initiation"><em>PFS #1-01: The Absalom Initiation</em></a> or the upcoming <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027s8?Pathfinder-Society-Intro-2-United-in-Purpose"><em>PFS Intro #2: United in Purpose</em></a>. Until then, he’ll take the default option of the Horizon Hunters.</p> 
                <hr width="50%"> 
                <p>And that’s it! Our three players now have new Pathfinder Society characters, in no time at all! Have any other tips for character building in PFS, or do you have a cool new build you’re looking forward to fleshing out? Share them below!</p> 
                <p>If you’re looking for more information on how to get involved with the Pathfinder Society, contact your local <a href="https://paizo.com/organizedplay/regions">Regional Venture Coordinator</a>, who can get you connected with the local lodge in your area.</p>

              <p>And now, let’s talk about Year 3’s “season finale.” You all knew it was coming, right? The Vast Experiment series follows the Society’s bid to commission a new generation of starships. On the brink of achieving this goal, the Exo-Guardians and Wayfinders launch a co-op mission to travel to a distant settlement near a deactivated Drift Beacon. The Starfinders find themselves walking into a trap set by a mysterious enemy. Does the Starfinder Society stand on the edge of destruction?

               <p>Our PaizoCon Europe organizers are hard at work putting together the schedule for the event! As a reminder, this convention will see the premiere of Pathfinder Society Year 3, so you’ll definitely want to check it out. Schedule, registration information, and a call for GMs will be available shortly, so keep an eye here for breaking news!</p> 
               <h3>Gen Con / Gen Con Online (September 17-19)</h3> 
               <p>While we wait for details from Gen Con on the full plan for this event, the organizing committee are busy making plans behind the scenes and the organized play developers are full steam ahead on shenanigans. Gen Con and Gen Con Online will see the premiere of our new interactive specials for the year, PFS2 3-99 and SFS 3-99, a set of interconnected specials where the actions taken in one affect the outcome of the other. More details on these specials will be released soon!</p> 
               <p>The Gen Con Organizing Committee has also put together a GM Interest form, found below. Please note that this form is <b>NOT</b> a GM signup form; filling it out does not guarantee you a spot to GM, nor does it commit you to anything yet. That form will come later, this is just to gauge GM interest in both the physical and online event. Take a few minutes to fill it out if you’re interested in running games in any form!</p>

               <p itemprop="description">Is there a more elegant way to title this post? Probably, but this is the most direct.</p> 
               <p>Hey there, my name is Fred Van Lente, and I’m thrilled to join the Paizo community by writing the <b>Pathfinder: Fumbus</b> one-shot comic book currently (or about to be)<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dynamiteent/pathfinder-fumbus?ref=project_link" target="_blank"> Kickstarted</a>. I’m best known for writing comics like <b>Amazing Spider-Man</b>, <b>Marvel Zombies</b>, <b>Archer &amp; Armstrong</b>, <b>Cowboys &amp; Aliens</b>, <b>Action Philosophers</b> (<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/eviltwinco/action-philosophers-vol-1-hooked-on-classics" target="_blank">currently in a Kickstarter for a color version itself</a>), but my very first published book was an RPG supplement for <b>Call of Cthulhu</b>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4449292-the-new-orleans-guidebook" target="_blank">The New Orleans Guidebook</a>, so it’s been very cool to come back to my roleplaying roots. </p> 
               <p>I am a pretty avid TTRPGer myself. I’ve got a monthly game I run and I’m in a weekly group where we rotate the games and gamemastering duties. (Both currently Zoom-based, alas.) <b>Pathfinder</b> is one of the systems I’ve most enjoyed playing; in this photo I am with Rhys, my sea elf druid who made it to 7th level in the <b>Skulls &amp; Shackles</b> campaign. This watercolor I’m holding was painted by my fellow player and accomplished cartoonist, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/worldwidecox/?hl=en">Alex Cox</a>. Hey Paizo, you ever need another iconic druid, I submit this handsome lad for your approval. </p>

               </div> 
               <br> 
               <p>We also ran <b>We Be Goblins!</b> in my weekly group (I was Chuffy Lickwound, whose face might make you sick, but whose knife is awful quick) so it was cool to bring to life Fumbus, everyone’s favorite goblin alchemist, in a new adventure that is the next installment of the long-running Pathfinder comics series—but you don’t need to be familiar with the previous adventures of Seoni, Merisiel, Valeros and friends to enjoy this one. And in addition to the graphic novella itself, there’s a lot of neat new playable goodies* in the back of the book for all your goblin alchemy needs. </p> 
               <p>So, if that sounds like something you’d be into, head over to the Kickstarter campaign and pledge! And once again, happy to be here—thanks for having me. </p> 
               <p>*Character options in Pathfinder: Fumbus were made by Paizo and are pre-approved for use with the Pathfinder Society Organized Play program!</p>

              <blockquote> 
               <p itemprop="description">I’m sorry, but that painting isn’t for sale. This particular item I’m keeping for myself.</p> 
               <p>Why, you ask? Well, there’s certainly worse ways to spend a rainy afternoon than in sharing a story with friends like you, so if you’ve got the time to listen, I can tell you a little bit about Crookcove, the Xarwins, and the house in that painting.</p> 
               <p>I’ve got my own reasons to be interested in the place. There, you see? At the top of the manor? A dome. A rotunda. An observatory. I’ve had dreams of converting that manor’s observatory into a temple, a place where anyone can come to observe the wonders of the Cosmic Caravan. But there’s a problem. The manor itself is located at the remote southwestern corner of Ravounel, and its ownership is kind of a tangled mess, one made worse by Ravounel’s secession from Cheliax. No one seems to know who rightfully owns the place. There was a sort of incident long ago, back when it was part of Cheliax, and the Chelish practice of redactions did a number on the legal documents that hold the building’s fate.</p> 
               <p>Doesn’t help that Crookcove’s so far off the beaten path, or that the government’s still got its hands full with more important things involving keeping their independence, or that the closest point of civilization is so many miles away.</p> 
               <p>Oh, and it certainly doesn’t help that they place is haunted.</p> 
               <p>But I’m getting ahead of myself.</p> 
               <p>The town itself wasn’t called Crookcove at first. It was founded by hellknights—the Order of the Gate, to be precise—as a staging ground for the initial construction of Citadel Enferac, way back in 4599. They called it “Crooked Cove,” on account of the shape of the cove itself. Hellknights aren’t the most creative folks. In any event, Enferac’s construction isn’t the story I’m telling.</p> 
               <p>The hellknights abandoned their presence in Crooked Cove a few years after it was founded, and for a handful of decades, the town was left to its own devices. The locals made a fair living for themselves continuing to tend the mines and lumber operations the hellknights started, but it wasn’t until the Thrunies took over the nation that Crooked Cove attracted outside attention once again.</p> 
               <p>In the days following the end of the Chelish Civil War, House Thrune began appointing minions into positions of power throughout the nation. Most saw Ravounel as something of a backwater, but not so a certain minor nobleman named Ioseff Xarwin. Details on how he managed to secure the title of paracount are unclear, but what remains a matter of record (in the few records you can find that aren’t redacted to the point of illegibility) is that he was granted Crooked Cove as his seat of power.</p> 
               <p>Crooked Cove had been largely untouched by the war, and according to my research, the locals were initially wary of this new paracount and of the sprawling mansion he’d started constructing on a bluff just outside town, but it wasn’t long before their opinions changed. The people of Crooked Cove soon came to value the influx of protection and support having a paracount provided, especially since Ioseff allowed the townsfolk to largely retain their traditions and independence. He saw to the construction of a church of Asmodeus, a tavern, a set of piers built around a town hall that doubled as a shipyard, and a smelting house to support the town’s trade, and in the span of a decade, Crooked Cove grew into a modestly successful mining concern, and as long as the iron, lead, and copper in the hills north of town continued to flow, Ioseff Xarwin left the townsfolk to their own designs. In return, the flow of tax money and exports to Cheliax’s heartland continued to guarantee Xarwin’s privacy.</p>

               <p>As a result of this pursuit for privacy, further details were tough to track down, but I was able to determine that Xarwin hadn’t chosen the site of his home idly. In one fragmentary letter I regrettably wasn’t able to make copies of (and that was one of countless documents lost in a fire a few months later), Xarwin himself hints that his “dreams were instrumental in selecting the site, for the views of the night skies above seem particularly inspiring.” He also mentioned in his letter that his “observatory’s construction has surpassed all expectations.”</p> 
               <p>I did a bit more digging and learned that Ioseff had a family as well—a wife and twin children. His wife, Asethanna, was something of a well-known sculptor and painter, and by all accounts the family lived their first many years in Crooked Cove in peace. But that didn’t last. Something happened a decade and a half later. Again, details are hard to come by, but from what little I’ve been able to piece together, the marriage crumbled from within. Ioseff became more and more obsessed with his astronomical observations, while Asethanna’s art started to grow darker and more sinister in theme.</p> 
               <p>It all came to a sudden end in 4657. Story goes that Asethanna fled the manor one night with the twins, and that Xarwin grew increasingly hostile and deranged. He let none visit his manor, and forbade the house servants from setting foot off the manor grounds—at least, according to the account of one such servant who claimed to have escaped from the manor. This unnamed servant apparently begged for the local authorities to intervene, but they had no time to act on his claims. The weather turned violent, with storms and floods devastating the town. And it didn’t stop with violent weather. The people themselves turned violent as well. Nightmares plagued the townsfolk when they slept, and when they woke the nightmares pursued them in the form of brutality, cruelty, and suicide. It wasn’t long before the townsfolk pulled up stakes and abandoned the place. Some say it was the storm that damaged the town’s sign, others claim it was the last citizen to flee who vandalized it, but to this day, those rare few who visit the place are greeted by a sign welcoming them to “Crookcove.”</p> 
               <p>That’s about it, I’m afraid. Other than stories of bad dreams by those rare few who stayed the night in the region over the past several years, and some likely apocryphal tales of people vanishing entirely after daring to enter Xarwin Manor itself, there’s little more to learn about the place. There’s apparently no surviving heirs to the Xarwin estate, and with Ravounel’s secession from Cheliax, the building’s been in government escrow, pending whatever steps they need to take to unravel its legal status. The manor itself is the only structure still standing in the region, with little more than hollow shells of structures hinting at what was once a bustling mining town down the hill below.</p> 
               <p>And all that brings us back to the painting.</p> 
               <p>I started having my own dreams about Crookcove and Xarwin Manor a few weeks after I picked up this painting, in any case. I’ve learned to trust my dreams—they’re not always accurate in what they foretell, but they’re always worth paying attention to, and there’s something in these dreams in particular that compel me. Are they perhaps related to the same source of compulsive dreams that first inspired Xarwin himself to build his home there? I can’t say other than that the manor itself feels to me to be a place of power. A place of importance. A place that should be restored and watched over. I’ve been saving up since then, and one day soon I hope to be able to make the trip out to Ravounel, secure ownership of the manor myself, and restore it. To rebuild it into a shrine to the Cosmic Caravan. To find out what happened there.</p> 
               <p>I assume that you’ve deduced by now what this painting depicts. Yes, here we see Xarwin Manor, in all its ruined glory. I’ve had the fortune to interview no fewer than four people who visited the ruins of Crookcove. None of them dared set foot in the manor proper, but they all agree that the painting is spot-on in its accuracy in capturing the gloom and menace the manor exudes today.</p> 
               <p>The part that bothers me about it isn’t the brooding stance of the birds who seem to stand guard at the edge of the frame, or the eerie glow that rises from beyond the central dome, or the twisted reaches of the dead trees in the yard, or even the mysterious light in the upstairs window.</p> 
               <p>The part that bothers me the most is the signature and date on the painting’s reverse. The signature of Asethanna Xarwin, dated 4653 AR, four years before whatever doom came to Xarwin Manor and left it abandoned over the ruins of a forgotten town.</p>

               <p itemprop="description">Have you ever had a beloved family pet expire due to old age, illness, or getting hit by an errant enercycle? The Pet Revitalization Project (PRP) would like to help return your best friend back to your side. This Eoxian company will use special silicon-based technology to revitalize your pet, keeping their personality, friendliness, and loyalty intact*. Many will find their pets stronger, more resilient, and hardier than before revitalization; works great on guard animals!</p> 
               <p>Though this technology was previously only available to the richest and most well connected individuals, new sources of resin and modern techniques have driven the cost of revitalization down. The PRP would like to extend these savings to you and your family. If you and your family are without the means to afford pet revitalization, the PRP has set aside a fund to aid in the swift return of your perished pet.</p> 
               <p>Pet revitalization is only viable for a short time after a pet’s expiration without proper body preservation techniques, leading some owners to preemptively revitalize their pets, ensuring their pets will remain with them always. Don’t you want your best friend to be your best friend forever? Contact the PRP today!</p> 
               <p>This message has been paid for by the Pact Worlds Commission for Unliving Rights, the Eoxian General Council, and the Eoxian Office of Pact Worlds Ambassadorship.</p>

               <h4>REVITILIZED PET SQUOX — CR 5</h4> 
               <p><b>XP 1,600</b><br> Silicon mummy squox (<em>Starfinder Alien Archive 4</em> 75, <em>Alien Archive 2</em> 118)<br> N Tiny undead<br> <b>Init</b> +5; <b>Senses</b> blindsense (scent) 30 ft., darkvision 60 ft., low-light vision; Perception +11</p>

               <p><b>STATISTICS</b><br> <b>Str</b> +2; <b>Dex</b> +5; <b>Con</b> —; <b>Int</b> –4; <b>Wis</b> +0; <b>Cha</b> +3<br> <b>Skills</b> Acrobatics +16 (+20 to balance, escape, or tumble), Athletics +11 (+19 to climb), Stealth +16<br> <b>Other Abilities</b> solar battery (1 point), unliving</p> 
               <p><b>SPECIAL ABILITIES</b></p> 
               <p><b>Constructed Shell (Ex)</b> For effects targeting creatures by type, a silicon mummy counts as both a construct and as undead (whichever type allows an ability to affect them for abilities that affect only one type, and whichever is worse for abilities that affect both types)</p> 
               <p><b>Silicon Casing (Ex)</b> A silicon mummy’s protective exterior and nonfunctional organs limit critical damage; the mummy has a 25% chance to ignore the extra damage dealt by a critical hit and gains a +4 bonus to saves against critical hit effects.</p> 
               <p><b>Solar Battery (Ex)</b> A silicon mummy can absorb solar energy in the form of Solar Reserve Points (SRP), which they can spend in place of Resolve Points. For every 8 hours a silicon mummy spends exposed to the light of a star, the mummy gains 1 SRP, to a maximum number of SRPs equal to one-third their CR (1 for a mummified prophet). For every week a silicon mummy absorbs no stellar energy, they lose 1 SRP. However, the mummy can intentionally enter a state of hibernation to lose only 1 point per 20 years, and although the mummy is aware of their surroundings and can fully animate as a move action, they are staggered for 1d4 hours afterward. As a swift action, a silicon mummy can expend 1 SRP to enhance either their next melee attack, ranged attack, or spell before the end of their turn. An enhanced attack gains a +2 circumstance bonus to its attack roll and deals an additional 3d6 damage if it hits. An enhanced spell increases the spell’s saving throw DC by 2.</p> 
               <p><b>Squox Tricks (Ex)</b> A squox can use Acrobatics to jump instead of Athletics. In addition, a squox can use its Acrobatics bonus as its attack bonus when it attempts a dirty trick, disarm, or trip combat maneuver. If the squox succeeds at a dirty trick maneuver, it can choose only between the entangled and off-target conditions. A squox’s tail, two front paws, and mouth count as hands free for a disarm attempt.</p> 
               <h4>PLOT HOOKS</h4> 
               <p>Game Masters might consider the following plot hooks as a means of integrating a revitalized pet into any Starfinder game.</p> 
               <ul> 
                <li>The PCs attempt to break into the home of a corporate executive, only to find an augmented squox guarding the interior.</li> 
                <li>A PC takes the Squox Companion feat, but later wants to ensure their little friend can survive the rigors of higher-level combat.</li> 
                <li>Murders in an Aballonian archology trace back to a group of silicon mummy animals, kept as house pets and guard animals that have somehow formed a telepathic network and started to attack those who would abuse them.</li> 
               </ul>

               <p>First off, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027l1?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-217-Lost-Maid-of-Anactoria"><em>PFS 2-17: Lost Maid of Anactoria</em></a> by Scott Young has the PCs travel to the nation of Ustalav to investigate a missing “local celebrity” in a small village. There’s more to this story than meets the eye, beginning with the fact that this celebrity is a mummified bog corpse! With little time, and horrific beings stalking the village outskirts, the PCs need to pull out all the stops to solve the disappearance and return the Maid of Anactoria to her home.</p>

               <p>Next up, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027l2?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-218-The-Fanciful-March-of-Urwal"><em>PFS 2-18: The Fanciful March of Urwal</em></a> by Hilary Moon Murphy takes the PCs back to distant Iobaria to help the faction leader of the Verdant Wheel commune with a powerful force. The PCs must attend to Urwal as he enters a dangerous trance in order to reach a mysterious destination. With demonic forces arrayed against them, it’s up to the PCs to pull out all the stops to defend one of the Society’s most important leaders. Also, the ending for this scenario has a pretty shocking reveal that veterans of Pathfinder Society Organized Play won’t want to miss out on!</p>

Michaels sends a group of Pathfinders off to the volcanic region of Droskar’s Crag to follow up on a lead from a group of prospectors. Learning of a hidden mountainside entrance that is believed to connect to a sprawling complex, the PCs travel into the mountains to learn exactly what dwells within the Pallid Peak.</p>

Directly charged by the Society’s leadership, the PCs travel to Sarkoris to enlist the aid of the Godcaller Nelket and the eidolon Dolok Darkfur of the Farheaven Clan in freeing a Pathfinder leader possessed by a dark spirit. When the PCs arrive, they find Dolok in the midst of a ritual to cleanse a part of the former Worldwound, and must act quickly to protect the Farheaven Clan and complete the ritual.</p>

               <p>A crew of scoundrels, rogues, and misfits finds it hard to survive in a galaxy where everyone has a price. Targeted by a crime boss and his army of enforcers, preyed upon by faceless mega-corporations, and hounded by rivals, the crew of the Free Trader Oliphaunt line up the big score that will at last make them rich beyond their wildest dreams. But when their many enemies join forces and the crew loses it all, they find out there's two things in the galaxy that can't be bought: freedom... and revenge.</p>

This volume also includes a series of "Side Jobs"—short mini-adventures the GM can insert into the campaign at any time—as well as a collection of new and dangerous aliens and details on the corporations that dominate the galaxy.</p>

               <p><b>By Chris Sims</b></p> 
               <p itemprop="description">The Haunter of the Dark, an aspect of the chaotic evil Outer God, Nyarlathotep, whispers to its loyal servants, the grioths (<em>Starfinder Alien Archive 4</em> 40–41), that something dire has awakened in the depths of the Pact Worlds sun. An elder being long imprisoned has broken free and moves toward the realm of mortals. Reading the portents, a grioth eclipse seer named Drenrika has determined that her raiders should be on Castrovel in the city of Candares during a springtime blood moon there in order to learn more about the burgeoning evil. And so, Drenrika enacted the eldritch rituals required to open a portal to Candares during the lunar eclipse.</p> 
               <p>Drenrika opened her gate in Candares’s Temple of the Dawnflower, an edifice almost as old as the city itself. Murderous grioth raiders mercilessly dealt with the temple’s clergy and poured into the city streets to murder and loot. They took out power substations to plunge parts of the city into darkness.</p> 
               <p>A survivor from the temple, a damaya lashunta mystic named Syell Yllsuoda, reports that the grioth leader remains in the sanctuary, awaiting something. Taking her down might close the grioth portal and strand the raiders without hope of reinforcements or retreat. The PCs are just the force for this decisive strike.</p> 
               <h3>Grioths in the Sanctuary — CR 8</h3> 
               <p>After fighting through the shadowy city streets, the PCs come to the Temple of the Dawnflower. Within its sanctuary, just beyond an ancient orrery, stands a lightless portal (represented with a “P” on the map) issuing a frigid wind. This portal is a powerful magical phenomenon of the conjuration school. A PC can suppress it for 1d4 rounds with a targeted dispel magic (dispel check DC 15) plus 1d4 rounds per 5 points by which the check exceeds the DC. If Drenrika dies or retreats through the portal, it closes 1 round later. To non-grioths, this portal is like a solid plane of stone.</p>

               <br> 
               <p><b>TACTICS</b></p> 
               <p><b>During Combat</b> The grioths open with mindshock. Half the grioths engage the PCs in melee, while the other half keep aloft and mobile, engaging if their comrades fall. Their main goal is to keep the PCs off Drenrika.</p> 
               <p><b>Morale</b> While Drenrika lives, the grioths fight to protect her. If she dies or flees, these raiders try to flee through the portal.</p> 
               <br>

               <br> 
               <p><b>SPECIAL ABILITIES</b></p> 
               <p><b>Mindshock (Su)</b> Once per day as a standard action, a grioth can unleash a wave of violent psychic energy. Each non grioth creature within 30 feet takes 2d6 damage and is shaken for 1d4 rounds. A creature that succeeds at a DC 12 Will save takes half damage and negates the shaken condition. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p> 
               <p><b>Psychotomimetic Saliva (Ex)</b> Grioth saliva is laced with psychotropic toxins that overload a victim’s neurological pathways, causing intense, rapid fire hallucinations, confusion, and violent seizures. Creatures that are immune to mind affecting effects are immune to this poison.</p> 
               <br> 
               <h4>Psychotomimetic Saliva</h4> 
               <p><b>Type</b> poison (injury); <b>Save</b> Fortitude DC 12</p>

                </rm></p> 
               <br> 
               <p><b>TACTICS</b></p> 
               <p><b>During Combat</b> Drenrika flies and uses high perches to maintain distance from her attackers. She casts her spells to separate the PCs and throw their attack into chaos. While she fights, she barks at her troops in Grioth, saying things such as, “We must hear the prophecy! Drive these fools away!”</p> 
               <p><b>Morale</b> When she falls to 19 or fewer Hit Points, Drenrika retreats through her portal.</p>

               <p><b>SPECIAL ABILITIES</b></p> 
               <p><b>Mindshock (Su)</b> As grioths, but the Drenrika can use this ability three times per day, and the DC is 16. A creature that succeeds at the save is immune to Drenrika’s mindshock for 24 hours.</p> 
               <p><b>Psychotomimetic Saliva (Ex)</b> As grioths, but the DC is 16.</p>

                <li>Pathfinder Society Year 3 will premiere at <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shm9?PaizoCon-Worldwide">PaizoCon Europe Online</a>, August 19-22!

                <li>The interactive specials for Pathfinder and Starfinder Society will premiere at Gen Con, September 16-19. These interactive specials are linked specials; the events of the Pathfinder special will affect the Starfinder event, so we encourage convention organizers to schedule both. Thurston and Jenny gave our authors a great concept to work with, and we’re excited for them to tell you more!</li> 
                <li>Finally, Linda dropped some exciting teasers for the Pathfinder Adventure Card Society special at PaizoCon Online: Ron Lundeen is the author, and it’s going to give players a chance to experience a new facet of the PACS stories they’ve enjoyed over the history of the program. </li> 
               </ul> 
               <p>We hope you’re looking forward to what we have in store over the next few months! Convention season is nearly upon us, which is both exciting and terrifying. But enough of my rambling, let’s see what else we’ve got to announce.</p> 
               <h2>Events</h2> 
               <p>We hope you all enjoyed the Double Points weekend for the new Pathfinder One-Shot, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027oe?Pathfinder-OneShot-1-Sundered-Waves"><em>Sundered Waves</em></a>! We had over 150 tables reported during that release weekend and are very pleased with the response. We’re looking at our release schedule to see when our next special event of this type might be, so stay tuned to the blog for future announcements.</p> 
               <p>Tonight at 6pm Pacific time, player signups for <a href="http://www.paizo.com/paizocon">PaizoCon Online</a> will open! Don’t forget to join the <a href="http://paizo.events/">Discord server</a>(direct link = paizo.events) for the latest news and updates. The <a href="https://warhorn.net/events/paizocon-online-2021">PaizoCon Warhorn</a> also includes our stream schedule; you’re free to sign up as a “player” to help plan your schedule for the event.</p> 
               <h2>Sanctioning</h2> 
               <p>The big sanctioning news this month is for our Starfinders: we have a brand new <a href="https://paizo.com/starfindersociety/characteroptions">Starfinder Society Character Options page</a>! This page updates the look to match the Pathfinder Society page and make it more user-friendly. In addition, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq026jv?Starfinder-Alien-Archive-4"><em>Alien Archive 4,</em></a> is now sanctioned for play! While you will need a boon to use any of the new races to build a PC, the equipment and class options contained in the book are now available to you. You’ll also notice that we’ve expanded the Core Sources to include the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujg?Starfinder-Alien-Archive"><em>Starfinder Alien Archive</em></a>.</p> 
               <p>On the Pathfinder side, we’re sanctioning <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/abominationVaults"><em>Abomination Vaults</em></a> and expect to complete it in the next two weeks, but no later than the end of April. We’ll post about it when it’s done!</p> 
               <p>Both of our Character Options pages have also added links to the errata for books which have had errata released. We hope this change will make the pages even more useful to our players. We’ll be looking at sanctioning the two One-Shots scheduled for release at PaizoCon next so that they’re ready for the event. After that, our upcoming sanctioning schedule includes the <a href="https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventures/adventurePath/devastationArk"><em>Devastation Ark</em> Adventure Path</a> for Starfinder, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027mn?Pathfinder-Bestiary-3"><em>Bestiary 3</em></a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027qf?Pathfinder-Adventure-Malevolence"><em>Malevolence</em></a> for Pathfinder, and have started working on <a href="https://paizo.com/tyrantsgrasp"><em>Tyrant’s Grasp</em></a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/returnOfTheRunelords"><em>Return of the Runelords</em></a> for Pathfinder (first edition). </p> 
               <h2>GM Achievements</h2> 
               <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the 5th milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios, as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains (program dependant). A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th milestone is 650 hours!</p> 
               <p>Two GMs received their fifth star in the past month. We have no new 5 Nova or 5 Glyph GMs to announce.</p> 
               <p><b>5th Star (PFS1)</b>: <em>Juan Sanchez and Andrew Torgerud</em></p> 
               <p>Congratulations to our new 5 Star GMs, and thank you for your dedication! If you believe you have achieved your 5th rank but haven’t been announced, email us at <a href="mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com">organizedplay@paizo.com</a>.</p> 
               <h2>Conventions</h2> 
               <p>In addition to PaizoCon Online, we have a number of conventions offering Pathfinder and Starfinder Society! </p>

               <h3>Nosferotter</h3> 
               <p>When encountering a nosferotter, take care how you proceed. They are very polite and almost charming when they ask your party to spare a skull and a few fingers, for the younglings of course. If you refuse, a romp of baby nosferotters will encircle the party. They are so small and fuzzy, quite cute in fact. What is this, nibbling on toes? Oh my, chewing on fingers… Oh dear… argh!</p> 
               <p>Can usually be found juggling small rocks, skulls, and finger bones.</p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/a71d65e0-c160-4341-83d9-b9205ef47cff/040121_Nosferotter.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/a71d65e0-c160-4341-83d9-b9205ef47cff/040121_Nosferotter.jpg" align="left" width="400" style="padding: 10px;" alt="Nosferotter, a bipedal otter with long claws and a cloak-like body"></a>

               <h3>Alien Arr-chive</h3> 
               <p>Some believe alien arr-chives are distant relations to ghorans and raxilites, but arr-chives remain close-mouthed about their species’ origins. After all, knowledge of other species and creatures is their stock in trade. And they use that wealth of information to aid in their constant piracy. </p>

               <p><b>Target Weak Spot (Ex)</b> As a move action, an alien arr-chive can size up an opponent with a successful Perception check (DC = 20 + the target’s level or CR). If successful, the arr-chive’s next attack that hits that creature deals an additional 4 points of damage, as long as that attack is made before the end of the arr-chive’s next turn.</p>

               <h3>Psstpsstmitl</h3> 
               <p>Few creatures delight in causing senseless chaos more than the feared psstpsstmitl. These felines look startlingly similar to domestic cats except for their towering size, the largest recorded sighting being over 70 feet tall at the shoulders. Though psstpsstmitls are ferocious predators and will eat nearly anything, many survivors of psstpsstmitl attacks report the colossal cats simply batting them around like toys, sending humanoids flying in various directions before appearing to grow bored and unceremoniously departing. Many adventurers swear that the monstrous felines simply enjoy wreaking havoc upon the battlefield, rather than being primarily motivated by food, though some reports describe the psstpsstmitl snatching provisions to eat after growing bored of knocking about its victims.</p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/7f836b80-27d9-4098-8d09-3c1a2da7a9a2/040121_Psstpsstmitl.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/7f836b80-27d9-4098-8d09-3c1a2da7a9a2/040121_Psstpsstmitl.jpg" align="left" width="400" style="padding: 10px;" alt="Psstpsstmitl, a very large feline similar to domesticated cats "></a>

               <h3>Dessert Drake</h3> 
               <p>Kin to the desert drake, among others, dessert drakes are kinder and gentler than their elemental relatives. Their scales range from pale custard to a crispy golden brown, and many dessert drakes accessorize their scales by painting colorful flowers and patterns. Dessert drakes love to conceptualize and bake new cakes, cookies and pastries, and are known to share their latest batches with nearby settlements and wayward travelers. Spoiler forums on the infosphere claim that bakers are auditioning to compete in a competition known as “The Great Triaxus Drake-Off,” judged by several prominent dessert drakes.</p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/f0146b17-04a8-4b98-a274-9c464eb2422f/040121_DessertDrake.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/f0146b17-04a8-4b98-a274-9c464eb2422f/040121_DessertDrake.png" align="left" width="400" style="padding: 10px;" alt="Kin to the desert drake, among others, dessert drakes are kinder and gentler than their elemental relatives.

               <h3>Nonsequitaur</h3> 
               <p>Many a Game Master may need to spice things up and interject a moment of tension in the middle of a confusing puzzle or long social engagement, and think “hey, a quick combat here would do the trick!” A centaur is a classic creature, but how would I justify having a centaur in the middle of this fancy dinner party in idk the Darklands or whatever? When no monster quite fits the situation, there’s always the nonsequitaur, a curious creature that is exactly like a centaur, except that it appears when you least expect it.</p>

               <p><b>HP</b> 40</p> 
               <p><b>You Should Have Paid Attention to the Centaur</b> [reaction] <b>Trigger</b> A creature ends its turn without attacking, casting spells at, using skills on, or otherwise acknowledging the nonsequitaur; <b>Effect</b> The nonsequitaur dominates all forms of interaction. It uses MORE! CENTAURS! as a reaction.</p> 
               <p><b>Forget about Me?</b> [reaction] <b>Trigger</b> The nonsequitaur leaves the field of view of all of the PCs; <b>Effect</b> The nonsequitaur feels ignored. It uses MORE! CENTAURS! as a reaction.</p> 
               <p><b>At Least That's Over</b> [reaction] <b>Trigger</b> The nonsequitaur is reduced to 0 Hit Points; <b>Effect</b> It isn't, not yet. The nonsequitaur uses MORE! CENTAURS! as a reaction, then dies.</p>

               <p><b>MORE! CENTAURS!</b> [two-actions] The nonsequitaur decides that this could be improved by more centaurs. It causes another nonsequitaur to spontaneously come into being in an unoccupied space within 60 feet. Before you ask, YES this summoned nonsequitaur can use MORE! CENTAURS! as well, NO this is not a design oversight. I write the blog, them's the breaks.</p>

               <h3>Floolf</h3> 
               <p>Frozen tundras are inhospitable places at the best of times, but the floolf is one such creature that has adapted to life in this most forbidding of landscapes. Their dense, long fur makes them appear extremely fluffy, which keeps their body temperatures well regulated. Like the chinchilla, floolves are hunted for their fur, but unlike the small rodent, floolves are considerably dangerous. Many an opportunistic soul has attempted to get rich quick by hunting and trapping floolves for their pelts, but such ventures rarely end in anything but a bonus snack for a hungry pack. </p> 
               <p>While floolves are highly social creatures, it is not unheard of for individuals to wander away from the pack for short periods of time. They are known for being highly defensive, swiftly and viciously attacking whatever they view as a threat. However, there are tales of people, particularly the very young or very old, who have become lost overnight near floolf territory and been approached by a solitary floolf who will curl up around them until dawn breaks, then lead them back to the nearest town or settlement.</p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/8bad6653-480d-49f5-b86f-1c8de3ea4a7a/040121_Floolf.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/8bad6653-480d-49f5-b86f-1c8de3ea4a7a/040121_Floolf.jpg" align="left" width="400" style="padding: 10px;" alt="A small, fuffy, canine-like creature"></a>

               <p><b>Pack Attack</b> The floolf’s attack deals 1d8 extra damage to creatures within the reach of at least two of floolf’s allies.</p> 
               <p><b>Cute Aggression</b> Floolf pups are so adorable that any creature that is either a mammal, or has an Intelligence above 3 that sees or touches a floolf pup must succeed at a DC 27 Will save or it will defend the floolf pup with its life. This effect ends when the creature is no longer able to perceive the pup. If the creature can speak, anytime it remembers the floolf pup, it feels a compulsion (Will save DC 15) to tell their story of the encounter, invariably ending with the phrase, “I would die for that floolf.”</p>
