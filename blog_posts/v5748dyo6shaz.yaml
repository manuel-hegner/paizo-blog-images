  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">The fire in the forest clearing\
  \ flickered merrily without wood or any sounds of crackling. Four fish sizzled on\
  \ a blue-bronze pan, placed to the side to cool enough to safely eat. Candles and\
  \ incense sticks were set in the earth, smoke rising from the smoldering tips to\
  \ curl upward into the night. The occupant of the tidy campsite was absolutely stunning,\
  \ her outfit rival to the leading lady of any royal court, her hair glowing like\
  \ flame in the light. Yet the most notable thing, the thing that should have given\
  \ Qiu's partners a bit of a clue, was the elaborate green mansion that loomed behind\
  \ her, a home fit for nobles in the middle of a forest.</p> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/071620_haojin.jpg\"\

  \ 13px;\">Art by Vladislav Orlowsk</p> \n     <p><em>You would have to be an idiot\
  \ to go near her. That's a fox woman if I ever saw one</em>, Qiu thought to themself.\
  \ So of course, Qiu's ox-brained partners had decided to rob the woman, and nothing\
  \ the bandit had said could dissuade the rest of their party. Qiu had finally given\
  \ up and left them to their fates, promising to be at their backs.<em> And stay\
  \ at their backs, far out of sight.</em></p> \n     <p>Qiu shouldn't have even been\
  \ that close. Maybe they felt they should at least stay and see what happened—that\
  \ they at least owed their companions that much for the victories and spoils that\
  \ the others had shared with them over the years. Maybe it was the woman. It had\
  \ been so long since Qiu had seen another fox hiding behind a human face, another\
  \ person who Qiu knew was truly like them.</p> \n     <p>Qiu watched their companions\
  \ approach. Yahui was being dramatic, as usual, trying to scare the woman with his\
  \ friendly-traveler-turned-threatening-robber act, as if anyone believed he was\
  \ ever friendly. Qiu instinctively ducked behind a tree as the woman stood up. Best\
  \ not to be in the splash zone if any bits of giblets came flying their way. Even\
  \ so, they couldn't help but lean an eye out to peek. The woman's hair seemed to\
  \ lose its gravity as she conjured magic power around her...</p> \n     <p>...and\
  \ then burst into flame, as her form morphed into that of a gargantuan bird of fire.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><em>Phoenix</em>, Qiu thought, their jaw dropping open in absolute stupor.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Yahui and the others weren't any more dignified, dropping their swords,\
  \ falling to the ground, trying desperately to crawl backward away from the searing\
  \ beast. They were bullies, not trained warriors. As they scrambled to their feet\
  \ to escape, the phoenix gestured with a wing, causing a wall of fire to encircle\
  \ the clearing. The magic blaze engulfed the trees, and yet the leaves and boughs\
  \ did not blacken or burn. Yahui noticed, the same as Qui did, and decided to try\
  \ his luck by leaping through the inferno. He was rewarded by his hair and clothes\
  \ bursting into flames, and he shrieked in panic as he rolled against the ground\
  \ to put himself out.</p> \n     <br clear=\"all\"> \n     <p>It was too much for\
  \ Qiu to take, the shock causing them to lose their grip on their form. Qiu felt\
  \ a muzzle and white fur popping out from their human guise, and rode the transformation\
  \ a little further, shifting all the way past a tailed humanoid into a small, four-legged\
  \ forest creature. If they were lucky, they could pretend to be a common fox—oh,\
  \ but it had been a mistake, a terrible mistake; the heat was unbearable in this\
  \ shape, and Qiu found themself blindly darting out into the clearing to get away\
  \ from those terrible embers and the pain of singed fur and whiskers.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>The woman looked human again by the time Qiu finished rubbing their paws on\
  \ their snout. No chance she hadn't noticed them now, a snow-white fox in the middle\
  \ of her clearing, icy breath fogging in the warm air. Qiu gulped and looked around\
  \ at their fellow bandits, though they knew their companions would be no help. At\
  \ least Yahui looked like he would survive, though he'd likely be burned and missing\
  \ his eyebrows for a while. </p> \n     <p>“Banditry is punished by execution, in\
  \ these lands,” their captor said. “Or at least, so it was. The law may have changed,\
  \ for I have been absent a long age.”</p> \n     <p>It hadn't, but Qiu didn't feel\
  \ it necessary to say that. The other bandits gibbered something unintelligible.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>“But what I do now is also unlawful. So are all tragedies—to be\
  \ caught between honor and humanity,” the woman mused, apparently deciding that\
  \ responses were optional. She gestured to Qiu, then lowered her hand to the ground\
  \ in a clear summons to approach. “You are a huli jing? Let us speak.”</p> \n  \
  \   <p>Qiu didn't bother trying to act dumb. It would be futile. This woman was\
  \ <em>ancient</em>—it showed in her speech, and her power, and her eyes.</p> \n\
  \     <p>“That's not a name I've heard used in a long time,” Qiu said, slipping\
  \ back into their true shape, a fox-faced humanoid with two tails, so that they\
  \ could more easily speak. Already they could hear the more common names for their\
  \ kind whispered among their bandit colleagues. Fox-demon. Liver-eater. Qiu would\
  \ never be able to work with them again after this. They surprised themself by feeling\
  \ a sense of mourning at that. </p> \n     <p>“I am Qiu. What can this humble huli\
  \ jing do for you?” Qiu asked, giving a sitting bow. They did their best to speak\
  \ formally, out of respect, but Qiu felt more like they had managed to land on pretentious\
  \ instead. </p> \n     <p>“I am Hao Jin,” the woman introduced politely, and Qiu\
  \ at last understood, and believed it. </p> \n     <p>The Ruby Phoenix. The most\
  \ powerful sorcerer of a nation and of an age. Perhaps of all ages. There were plenty\
  \ of children named in her honor, but Qiu doubted any possessed the raw magic they\
  \ had just witnessed.</p> \n     <p>She continued, graciously ignoring their expression,\
  \ “I am looking for a dead-people.”</p> \n     <p>“A dead-people?” Qiu echoed. It\
  \ wasn't a phrase they were familiar with, and the literal words didn't quite make\
  \ sense. There were corpses a plenty in this forest, and likely some undead as well,\
  \ but they didn't feel like what Hao Jin was asking for.</p> \n     <p>“This is\
  \ no longer the word that is used?” Hao Jin asked, after a moment of hesitation.\
  \ “A people that the empire of Lung Wa declared dead. Their houses are to be destroyed,\
  \ their records of lineage burned. Their language must never be spoken. Their name\
  \ will become a myth. They are erased. They are no longer real.”</p> \n     <p>Qiu\
  \ chewed their gums at the weight of those words. <em>Dead-people</em>. “I do not\
  \ know how anyone could find such a group. Even Lung Wa is something of a myth,\
  \ these days.”</p> \n     <p>“I remembered their name, in defiance. They were the\
  \ Xijae people. They lived here once,” Hao Jin said, standing up to walk inside\
  \ her ornate green mansion and gesturing for Qiu to follow. When they entered, they\
  \ found a museum room graced with armfuls of jewelry, books, and scrolls in a mysterious\
  \ writing. Costumes and headdresses, every thread and color vibrant and pristine.\
  \ Qiu reached out before they could stop themself, eyes open in awe as they examined\
  \ the embroidery and delicately worked metal. They'd never seen patterns like these\
  \ before, never seen this artistic style. It had been <em>erased</em>. Erased before\
  \ Qiu had been born, <em>stolen</em> without them ever knowing—but wait a moment...</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“I've seen these before,” Qiu said after a long thought, rolling a jade\
  \ and silver bead between their fingers. “There was an old man who made them in\
  \ a village forty li to the south.”</p> \n     <p><em>We robbed his shipment blind,</em>\
  \ Qiu did not say. They were starting to feel very bad about that. “I don't know\
  \ if he's still alive, but...”</p> \n     <p>“Show me the way,” Hao Jin commanded,\
  \ before Qiu could think of how to finish that sentence. She stepped back outdoors\
  \ to set her pans and plates back in her house, ushering Qiu outside as well. Qiu\
  \ watched in awe as the building shrunk down to the size of a child's wooden toy\
  \ in her hands. She glanced at the other bandits, seeming to weigh their fate in\
  \ her hands before she evidently decided they weren't worth the distraction. With\
  \ a wave of the sorceress' arms, the wall of fire surrounding the camp vanished.\
  \ Qiu thought they heard her trying to say 'Go forth and do no evil' or something\
  \ else with suitable gravitas, but the bandits were running and screaming before\
  \ she could get that far.</p> \n     <p>“Come,” Hao Jin said, with a sigh at the\
  \ robbers' antics. A gust of wind blew out her campfire; another lifted the two\
  \ of them into the air. They shot up above the earth, to a height that sent Qiu's\
  \ head spinning—or maybe it was the speed, or the thin air. They barely managed\
  \ to keep consciousness to point out the tiny speck below with one shaking claw.\
  \ The descent was no slower or easier, leaving Qiu gasping for breath as Hao Jin\
  \ approached the village on foot, having been kind enough to the nerves of the residents\
  \ not to land in the middle of their town. </p> \n     <p><em>Now is the time to\
  \ run</em>, Qiu thought. </p> \n     <p>But just the memory of the phrase <em>dead-people</em>\
  \ sent them staggering into the town on the heels of the sorceress. Qiu could see\
  \ that she had taken out the strand of beads Qiu had picked out, holding them up\
  \ to a tiny crowd of four people, as another man hurried out from inside his small\
  \ house with a woman following behind him. By the time Qiu reached the scene, the\
  \ man was holding out his own hand, a trio of similar jade beads presented in his\
  \ palm for Hao Jin to see.</p> \n     <p>“I was given these for safekeeping a long\
  \ time ago,” Hao Jin said, pulling some of her ancient books from seemingly nowhere.\
  \ She offered them to the man with a humble bow. “It has been long past the age\
  \ when I should have returned them. Please, forgive me.”</p> \n     <p>Qiu could\
  \ see the emotions run rampant across the man's face as he carefully took the book\
  \ and opened it. Confusion, morphing into recognition, then disbelief. Then a profound\
  \ and deep-cutting sadness, one that ran back generations, one that could never\
  \ be healed, but perhaps now could be soothed.</p> \n     <p>“My grandfather spoke\
  \ this,” the village man said, sharply turning his face away so that the ancient\
  \ book's precious, forgotten language could not be smeared and ruined by his tears.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>The former bandit watched the villagers crowd around Hao Jin, their\
  \ voices blending in questions and exclamations. A breeze rustled through Qiu’s\
  \ fur, and they suddenly felt a cold loneliness buried within their chest. </p>\
