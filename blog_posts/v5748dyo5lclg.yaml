  \ fed!\n    </div> \n    <p>Hi there! My name is Meredith Kniest, and I'm the latest\
  \ edition of the Paizo Intern. I've been asked to explain a bit about myself and\
  \ my experience at Paizo so far, which frankly is an awesome relief from staring\
  \ at Excel spreadsheets. Oh, the joys of interning.</p> \n    <p>I'm currently a\
  \ senior at the University of Washington studying English and French. After having\
  \ scoured internship postings in the greater Seattle area for months, and with gloomy\
  \ national job forecasts echoing about my brain in the available space between Shakespeare\
  \ and Balzac, I was beginning to resign myself to a long and dismal job search.\
  \ That's when I came across Wesley's ad for an editing internship with Paizo. With\
  \ a peculiar amount of trepidation did I apply—after all, the closest I've ever\
  \ come to playing a tabletop RPG was creating fantasy adventures for my little brother\
  \ using Playmobil people and Lincoln Logs, long ago, in the dusty days before Zelda\
  \ took her first three-dimensional step, when Doug was the best show on television.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Three weeks into the position, I've learned a great deal about the Pathfinder\
  \ universe, though I still feel like the greenest noob since Leeroy Jenkins, especially\
  \ around the other Paizo employees, whose daily conversation—<i>Hey, have we ever\
  \ used flying cats as monsters?</i> and <i>Do we have a rule for wading through\
  \ water?</i>—flits by my ears like Miles Davis at a fifth-grade band concert.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>My first intern assignment is to continue a job begun by interns of yesteryear:\
  \ cataloging all of the Pathfinder rules not included in the <i>Core Rulebook</i>.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Yes, ALL of them.</p> \n    <p>It took me a couple of days to comprehend\
  \ the daunting scale of this task. It's doubtful that it will be finished by me.\
  \ Or by anyone, ever. I was discouraged, I won't lie. I had hoped to really wow\
  \ my new employers with amazing ninja cataloging skills. (Hey, I take pride in my\
  \ work. It keeps me going after caffeine has worn off.</p> \n    <p>However, I've\
  \ been finding solace and diversion in the compelling, sometimes morbid storytelling\
  \ that seems to make Pathfinder unique. I'm used to video game storytelling. Pathfinder\
  \ is on a whole new, deeper, infinitely more variable and complex level than video\
  \ games are capable of. Often I completely forget to catalog a rule or a stat block\
  \ because I'm gripped by the lycanthropy of Duristan Silvio Ariesir or the perversions\
  \ of the Runelords of Runeforge.</p> \n    <p>Feel free to send me your prayers,\
  \ your derision, or any obscure Pathfinder rules you can think of. I'll be here,\
  \ reading about the Blood Veil in Korvosa and, possibly, forgetting to do my job.</p>\
