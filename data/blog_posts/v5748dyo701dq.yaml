  \ by Pixoloid Studios</p>\n      </div>\n      <br>\n      <p>New Ancestries<strong><br></strong>Let’\
  s deep dive into those 10 ancestries, shall we? I love meeting alien nufriends!</p>\n\
  \      <p><strong>Android:</strong> Play a synthetic humanoid with an artificial\
  \ body and a real soul. Androids have enjoyed a few upgrades since the era of Lost\
  \ Golarion, so even if you’ve already played an android in Pathfinder, you should\
  \ check out the new options!</p>\n      <p><strong>Barathu:</strong> Have you ever\
  \ wanted to become an enigmatic alien with a bizarre form? How about a floating\
  \ blimplike entity that can merge with other creatures and rewrite their own genetic\
  \ code? Barathus got you covered for weird and wonderful.</p>\n      <p><strong>Human:</strong>\
  \ These adaptable survivors from Lost Golarion are a legacy ancestry with new options.\
  \ What more do I need to explain? You’re a human, right? (Aren’t you?)</p>\n   \
  \   <p><strong>Kasatha:</strong> These traditionalists traveled aboard a worldship\
  \ called the <em>Idari</em> from a faraway home world. Instead of colonizing the\
  \ worlds they found, they remained aboard the <em>Idari</em>. Kasathas have four\
  \ arms, always cover their nose and mouth in public, and sometimes carry puzzleblades,\
  \ a traditional weapon that’s ritualistically assembled each day.</p>\n      <p><strong>Lashunta:</strong>\
  \ If you like the idea of playing a humanlike alien, consider a lashunta. They’\
  re psychic humanoids who choose how they evolve at puberty, becoming a burly warrior\
  \ or graceful enhanced scholar—or perhaps becoming someone entirely different and\
  \ unpredictable.</p>\n      <p><strong>Pahtra:</strong> Pahtras are cat people from\
  \ a rebel planet who are known for their achievements in magic and music. Their\
  \ home world Pulonis just declared independence from the Veskarium empire and joined\
  \ the Pact Alliance. I’ve heard they don’t put up with any imperial nyansense nowadays.</p>\n\
  \      <p><strong>Skittermander: </strong>That’s me, Captain Concierge! We’re energetic,\
  \ six-armed people with colorful fur who love to give our allsix helping our nufriends\
  \ and old pals every day! You’ll never regret having a skittermander on your team!</p>\n\
  \      <p><strong>Vesk:</strong> Vesk are scaled humanoids with a powerful physique\
  \ and warmongering reputation. They even think they conquered the skittermander\
  \ home world, Oeddertchonk, but who are they kidding? I know a lot of vesk who defy\
  \ that reputation—they can be anyone they want to be, just like you.</p>\n     \
  \ <p><strong>Ysoki:</strong> Pathfinder players might recognize the clever, flexible\
  \ ratfolk who tend to love tinkering with technology. Their small bodies make them\
  \ really comfy with space travel—just like us skittermanders!</p>\n      <p><strong>Versatile\
  \ heritages</strong> are special heritages characters of any ancestry can take.\
  \ Anyone can become a borai or prismeni.</p>\n      <p><strong>Borai:</strong> Created\
  \ by botched resurrections and necromantic experiments, a borai is an undead soul\
  \ attached to a living body. In addition to fitting in at every goth club in the\
  \ galaxy, they get creepy abilities from their connection to the grave.</p>\n  \
  \    <p><strong>Prismeni:</strong> Prismenis are touched by the energy of the Drift,\
  \ a recently discovered hyperspace plane, or have a deep connection to spectra,\
  \ the elusive “Drift Angels” who are native to hyperspace. Most of them have rainbow\
  \ hair, flighty personalities, and become ace pilots.</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \       Illustration by Pixoloid Studios</p>\n      </div>\n      <br>\n      <h2>New\
  \ Classes</h2>\n      <p>One of the most exciting parts of any game is trying out\
  \ new classes! Here’s who you can be in Starfinder Second Edition.<br><br><strong>Envoy:</strong>\
  \ You’re the face of the party and the self-proclaimed battle leader (or cheerleader,\
  \ mascot, boss, whatever)! Boost your friends and trip up your enemies by giving\
  \ out directives, then lead by example to grant your team extra buffs.</p>\n   \
  \   <p><strong>Mystic:</strong> You have a connection to a primeval force of the\
  \ universe, and you channel powerful magic and healing through bonds with your allies.\
  \ You are a healer and spellcaster, with classic Pathfinder spells plus new magic\
  \ from the future.</p>\n      <p><strong>Operative:</strong> You have a deadly aim\
  \ and a keen set of tactics to take down powerful enemies. You’re likely a scout,\
  \ infiltrator, or spy for your party, and you’re a primary damage dealer.</p>\n\
  \      <p><strong>Solarian:</strong> You cycle between the powers of gravity and\
  \ light, manifesting solar weapons and unleashing stellar energy in flashy attacks.\
  \ You’re a close-quarters combatant relying on your mobility to stay out of danger.</p>\n\
  \      <p><strong>Soldier:</strong> You unleash heavy weapons on foes while protecting\
  \ your allies. Soldiers are close-quarters combatants who use powerful area weapons\
  \ or two-handed weapons and wear heavy armor.</p>\n      <p><strong>Witchwarper:</strong>\
  \ You’re a living paradox who can warp reality with powerful spells and manifest\
  \ the infinite possibilities of the multiverse in your current reality. You’re also\
  \ a powerful spellcaster with access to familiar favorites from Pathfinder and flashy\
  \ new magic from the future.</p>\n      <p><strong>Archetypes:</strong><em>Player\
  \ Core</em> brings you archetype options for each class, plus a new archetype that\
  \ lets you become a galactic explorer with the famous spacefaring society: <strong>Starfinder\
  \ Field Agent!</strong></p>\n      <h3>But what about tech classes?</h3>\n     \
  \ <p>I get it, you want drones and magic hacks and deployable mines! The Starfinder\
  \ Tech Playtest (April 21<sup>st</sup> to May 30<sup>th</sup>) features the <strong>mechanic</strong>\
  \ and <strong>technomancer </strong>classes. Mechanic and technomancer will be appearing\
  \ in a future book which the StarFriends haven’t told me about yet.</p>\n      <div\

  \     <p>If you’re going on an adventure in outer space, you need a starship, and\
  \ it doesn’t hurt to know your way around a computer console. That’s why we’re introducing\
  \ two new skills, <strong>Computers</strong> and <strong>Piloting</strong>, to represent\
  \ taking control of a starship or hacking into a secure computer system. Starfinder\
  \ has a bundle of new Lore skills too—Fashion Lore, Junker Lore, Vidgame Lore, and\
  \ Technology Lore are some of my favorites.</p>\n      <h2>New Feats</h2>\n    \
  \  <p>The Starfinder team had fun coming up with cool feats to show off how skills\
  \ work in Starfinder Second Edition. You can create your own temporary Barricade\
  \ on the battlefield, become a Phreaker and learn to hack without a toolkit, gain\
  \ a free augmentation with Augmented Body, and more! Plus you’ll notice many of\
  \ your favorite feats from Pathfinder Second Edition, like Battle Medicine and Toughness.</p>\n\

  \ Player Core!</em><br>\n         Illustration by Gunship Revolution</p>\n     \
  \ </div>\n      <br>\n      <h2>New Equipment</h2>\n      <p><em>Starfinder Player\
  \ Core</em> contains an armory of new gear to outfit your character for their galactic\
  \ adventures. Instead of using magical runes to upgrade your items, in Starfinder\
  \ Second Edition tech equipment follows an improvement system we like to call CTASEUP.\
  \ Most characters start out with commercial gear, but gradually upgrade to tactical,\
  \ advanced, superior, elite, ultimate, and paragon versions.</p>\n      <p><strong>Tech\
  \ Gear:</strong> Whatever you need for exploration, we’ve got you covered with medical\
  \ supplies, adventuring equipment, entertainment devices, and more. Chug a sharpshooter\
  \ serum to improve your aim, use your comm unit as a flashlight, or slap a medpatch\
  \ on an injury.</p>\n      <p><strong>Armor:</strong><em>Player Core</em> has all\
  \ kinds of neato options like kyokor plating—that’s armor made from the scaly hide\
  \ of a kaiju.</p>\n      <p><strong>Shields:</strong> Raising a shield is always\
  \ a solid tactic on any planet, and you’ll enjoy checking out tech like the retractable\
  \ irising shield or hardlight phase shield.</p>\n      <p><strong>Weapons:</strong><em>Player\
  \ Core</em> has everything from laser rifles to dueling swords. There’s some wild\
  \ weapons in here—a neural lash you control psychically, a cutlass glimmering with\
  \ stolen lives, a singing spear, and a nasty little number called the painglaive,\
  \ a motor-powered fangblade mounted to a polearm.</p>\n      <p><strong>Upgrades:</strong>\
  \ Most armor and weapons are customizable, with slots for one or more upgrades.\
  \ Upgrades include everything from environmental protections to jetpacks or magical\
  \ holoprojectors that change your gear’s appearance. <strong>Solarian crystals</strong>\
  \ are a special type of upgrade that boost a solarian’s solar weapon attacks.</p>\n\
  \      <p><strong>Grenades:</strong> Grenades are consumable items that explode\
  \ in a small radius, dealing different types of damage and creating different effects.\
  \ In Starfinder Second Edition, throwing a grenade doesn’t require you to make an\
  \ attack roll. Instead, you chuck it at the target, and any creatures in range make\
  \ a Reflex save against your class DC. Just be careful where you throw those electromag\
  \ grenades. They cause tech creatures to glitch out and that could be a problem\
  \ for your friend Captain Concierge.</p>\n      <p><strong>Magic Items:</strong>\
  \ Have you ever wanted a special contact lens that lets you peer into the record\
  \ of all mortal experience? What about a crystal <em>diva’s microphone</em> that\
  \ amplifies your voice and performance? A pocket dimension in a backpack? Starfinder\
  \ magic items can do all this and more.</p>\n      <p><strong>Augmentations:</strong>\
  \ Augmentations are a special type of gear surgically implanted into your body that\
  \ modifies your anatomy. If you want to breathe fire, just head down to the clinic\
  \ and get a dragon gland implanted in your throat. Flying is no problem with ultralight\
  \ wings installed into your arms or other alien appendages. There are different\
  \ types of augmentations in this book: biotech, magical, magitech, and tech. Augmentations\
  \ also include apex items that permanently increase your attributes.</p>\n     \
  \ <h2>New Spells</h2>\n      <p>With two new spellcasting classes in this book,\
  \ you’ll find a trove of brand new spells plus many of your old favorites from Pathfinder.\
  \ In this chapter, you can give yourself a <em>glow up</em> or summon a <em>phantasmal\
  \ fleet</em> of starships to bombard your enemies.</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \  <br>\n      <h2>Playing the Game</h2>\n      <p>Most importantly, <em>Starfinder</em><em>Player\
  \ Core</em> teaches you how to play Starfinder Second Edition and acts as a reference\
  \ for play sessions. <em>Starfinder GM Core</em> has even more information about\
  \ environment rules, hazards and traps, vehicles, and more—but that’s a topic for\
  \ another time! Keep your eyes and other sensory organs on this space for the next\
