  > \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Time to catch you up on the story so far in\
  \ <a href=\"/pfsacg/products/season2\">Season of the Runelords</a>! (There be <i>plot\
  \ spoilers</i> below.) While I'm discussing SotRu, allow me to apologize for the\
  \ persistent delays in its release schedule. We're working hard to improve the process\
  \ for subsequent products, and the entirety of the season will be available for\
  \ play at Gen Con.</p> \n    <p>The season begins with a lowly party of wannabe\
  \ adventurers banding together to visit the town of Sandpoint, with an eye toward\
  \ becoming famous heroes like those who defeated Karzoug, the ancient Runelord of\
  \ Greed. (This adventure is loosely based on the events of the <a href=\"/products/btpy921r\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder: Dark Waters Rising</em></a> comics by Jim Zub.) Sandpoint being\
  \ Sandpoint, you run into some nasty, filthy goblins before you even get into town.\
  \ These particular goblins are even more disgusting than usual: they're covered\
  \ in oozing, mottled pustules that have a tendency to pop.</p> \n    <p>After you\
  \ dispatch the goblins, you barely make it into the city limits before the mayor\
  \ turns you around and sends you after the black dragon who's treating Sandpoint's\
  \ cattle farms as his personal all-you-can-eat buffet. Unfortunately, instead of\
  \ vanquishing Black Fang and saving the day, you just make him really mad and he\
  \ swears vengeance against the town. Being a hero is not as easy as it looks.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>In an attempt to curry favor with the town council, you investigate the\
  \ matter of the mutated goblins, and discover that someone's been up to no good\
  \ in the wilds around town. After suffering goblin explosions of various types,\
  \ you discover that a devotee of Lamashtu has set up her own mutant gobbo factory\
  \ as a first course, feeding the goblins some sort of heinous potion to turn them\
  \ explode-y. The main dish will be her spawning some sort of abomination linked\
  \ to the Mother of Monsters. It's nice when it's easy to tell what the right course\
  \ of action is, huh?</p> \n    <p>With the Lamashtu-spawn and its incubator taken\
  \ care of, you return to Sandpoint to find the council member who led you into the\
  \ goblin trap. Turns out he's the manipulator behind all the shenanigans, and he\
  \ needs a good thumping before he uses some of the aforementioned potion on the\
  \ dragon that's got it in for the town. It would be great if you could stop him\
  \ before that happens, wouldn't it?</p> \n    <p>Ah, well. Beating down mutant dragons\
  \ is good practice for heroes like you.</p> \n    <p>Having saved/wrecked the town\
  \ of Sandpoint, you feel ready for a greater challenge/would like to avoid being\
  \ run out of town on a rail, so you make for Magnimar, famed City of Secrets. (This\
  \ adventure is inspired by the <a href=\"/products/btpy9dxu\"><em>City of Secrets</em></a>\
  \ comics, also by Jim Zub.) You arrive just in time for Xanderghul's Night (he was\
  \ the Runelord of Pride) and just in time to save a wedding from some demonic party\
  \ crashers.</p> \n    <p>Your convenient heroics bring you into the orbit of Lieutenant\
  \ Kasadei of the City Watch, who has a number of tasks for irregulars with good\
  \ instincts and timing. Kasadei sends you into Underbridge, a promising-sounding\
  \ area of Magnimar, where some rogues' guilds are having a bit of a turf war. Your\
  \ diplomatic abilities, though rusty, should prove sufficient to the task of fairly\
  \ divvying up whatever they're fighting over.</p> \n    <p>Next up is an investigation\
  \ into some shapechanging shenanigans, in which some prominent local citizens are\
  \ being impersonated. Turns out the creepy doctor with the sanatorium is behind\
  \ it all, which is completely shocking. The prominent local citizens are pleased\
  \ with your work, so you are promoted to guarding a special exhibit at the Museum\
  \ of Ages from the expected assaults of some Cultists of the Crimson Eye. The Pathfinder\
  \ Society (and local luminary Sheila Heidmarch) are pleased with your work, and\
  \ remunerate you well. Time to head to Hollow Mountain!</p> \n    <p>Well, once\
  \ you figure out who's murdering all these priests of Sarenrae, anyway.</p> \n \
  \   <p>Ever since you decided to become heroes, you've had your eye on Hollow Mountain.\
  \ It's imposing, it's isolated, and the top of it is carved to resemble Alaznist,\
  \ the Runelord of Wrath, who is said to have reigned over her territory from the\
  \ mountain itself. (This adventure is loosely based on the encounters at the end\
  \ of each <a href=\"/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics/hollowMountain\"\
  ><em>Hollow Mountain</em></a> comic by various awesome authors.)</p> \n    <p>You\
  \ pay a ship's captain to drop you off on the shores of Rivenrake Island, home to\
  \ both the Mountain and the ruins of an old Thassilonian city, Xin-Bakrakhan. Time\
  \ to plunder the ruins for sweet loot! Surely everything that lived here died a\
  \ long time ago.</p> \n    <p>Wrong. Wrong. You were wrong about everything here\
  \ being dead. This place has angry, angry inhabitants. Because you're mighty adventurers,\
  \ you triumphed, but that was not a pleasant experience. Some things you can't unsee.\
  \ Still, you found a passageway that heads down into the stone, and therefore theoretically\
  \ into Hollow Mountain. Heroic stories tell you that secret ways are better ways\
  \ for exploring, so you set off.</p> \n    <p>Hey, this cavern has a big tower in\
  \ it! Towers mean mages, which means pricy magic items and other valuables. As it\
  \ turns out, it also means some sort of clockwork sentries and a nasty tower guardian.\
  \ The cavern also has other stuff in it, and it messes with your stuff and tries\
  \ to kill you, because that's the sort of place this is. This is what you wanted:\
  \ adventure and danger and glory. You repeat that to yourself as you wipe splattered\
  \ polyp and fungal spores off your face. Soon, you'll be inside the mountain, and\
  \ you'll make your bones and feature in all the bard's songs.</p> \n    <p>Until\
  \ next time, Pathfinders!</p> \n    <p>Tanis O'Connor<br> <i>Adventure Card Game\
