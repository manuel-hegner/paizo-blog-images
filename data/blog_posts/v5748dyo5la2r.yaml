  \ \n    <p class=\"date\">Wednesday, January 9, 2008</p> \n    <p> One of the early\
  \ lessons I learned working on adventures for <i>Dungeon</i> was that RPG players\
  \ have an extra level of demands when it comes to dragons. You can throw pretty\
  \ much any other monster into an adventure without worry, but if you want to include\
  \ a dragon, you'd best be sure said dragon has a history and personality. And honestly,\
  \ the readers are right (as they often are). Dragons shouldn't be throwaway encounters.\
  \ They shouldn't just wander by as a result of a wandering monster result. In <i><a\
  \ href=\"/pathfinder\">Pathfinder</a></i>, I'm going to try to make sure that whenever\
  \ we have a dragon appearing in the adventure, he or she has a story. Especially,\
  \ as in the case of <i>Pathfinder</i> #5, when the dragon appears on the cover.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The white dragon on the cover is Arkrhyst—called Freezemaw by the Shoanti—\
  an old white dragon who has lived on Rimeskull for 50 years. In his youth several\
  \ centuries ago, Arkrhyst was a great and hated enemy of the Shoanti; his raids\
  \ on the nomads of the Velashu Uplands and the western Storval Plateau were legendary,\
  \ and many of those tribes still sing of these dark times, and of the countless\
  \ heroes who sought out his home on Rimeskull to defeat him. None accomplished this\
  \ goal, but as Arkrhyst grew older, his urge to raid grew less. Content now with\
  \ the reputation he earned, he sleeps for years at a time on his considerable store\
  \ of treasure, dreaming of his youthful rampages.</p> \n    <p>Of course, Freezemaw's\
  \ only one of many menaces that wait for PCs brave enough to seek out the legendary\
  \ dungeon of Runeforge in <i>Pathfinder</i> #5—but he's certainly one of the adventure's\
  \ more memorable villains!</p> \n    <p> James Jacobs <br> <i>Pathfinder</i> Editor-in-Chief</p>\
