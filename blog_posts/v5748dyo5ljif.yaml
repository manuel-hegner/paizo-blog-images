  >Hard to believe the year passed so fast, but it's time again to invite people to\
  \ help out with Pathfinder Society activities at <a href=\"http://gencon.com\" target=\"\
  _blank\">Gen Con</a>. As in prior years, Paizo is once again a co-sponsor with our\
  \ booth on the Exhibit Floor, seminars galore, and activities in the Sagamore Ballroom.\
  \ But we have a few changes in store as well. So grab some coffee, get comfortable,\
  \ and see what Organized Play has up its sleeve for the \"Best Four Days in Gaming!\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Several weeks ago, I put out a call for volunteers to fill Department\
  \ Head and Lead positions at Gen Con 50. It pleases me greatly to introduce this\
  \ year's team. They and the PFS team will work closely to make Gen Con 50 the smoothest\
  \ and most awesome event to date!</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <h3>Leads</h3> \n\
  \     <p>Jon Cary, Bob Jonquet, Todd Morgan, and Lucas Servideo</p> \n     <h3>Department\
  \ Heads</h3> \n     <p>Kelly Brummond, Seth Brummond, Kevin Hanley, Tina Saunders,\
  \ Walter Sheppard, Mark Stratton, and Dominick Trascritti.</p> \n    </blockquote>\
  \ \n    <p>What plans we have for this year! <a href=\"/pfsacg\">Adventure Card\
  \ Guild (ACG)</a> returns with play from all published Seasons, including Season\
  \ of Plundered Tombs and Season of the Goblin. Back as well is the ever-popular\
  \ Gen Con Open, bigger and badder than ever. On the <a href=\"/pathfindersociety\"\
  >Roleplaying Guild (RPG)</a> side, we're offering a variety of scenarios from the\
  \ current Year of the Stolen Storm, as well as some retro events from past Seasons.\
  \ Season 9 takes off as well, though you'll have to wait until PaizoCon to hear\
  \ the <del>devious</del> <del>diabolical</del> awesome plots concocted by John and\
  \ the PFS team.</p> \n    <p>Following in the footsteps of last year's interactive,\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9mbe?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-800-The-Cosmic-Captive\"\
  ><em>8-00: The Cosmic Captive</em></a>, Friday night's interactive will include\
  \ both ACG and RPG components. Saturday evening will have a large event for RPG\
  \ and Sunday sees the finals of the ACG Gen Con Open! The team has a few surprises\
  \ up our sleeves, but the time is not yet ripe to share them. Once the schedule\
  \ is finalized, we will share with our players via blog and Gen Con's event page!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Back again is Pathfinder Society Academy (PSA) returns, bigger than ever.\
  \ This year, we reserved 15 tables for youth-friendly games. The schedule includes\
  \ lessons—Beginner, Advanced, and Transitions—similar to prior years, as well as\
  \ full scenarios from the Pathfinder Society catalog. Having a dedicated area for\
  \ our youth and their families gives us the opportunity to offer positive experiences\
  \ in a youth-friendly format.</p> \n    <p>At this time, we are still in discussions\
  \ about what to do with our demo space. Until those are concluded, I don't want\
  \ to make any announcements. Once we decide, we will reach out to the volunteer\
  \ pool to fill the slots.</p> \n    <p>The past few years saw the HQ volunteers\
  \ and the GM volunteers on vastly different schedules. While this helped with some\
  \ of the logistics and people moving, the HQ slots were long and mixed groups couldn't\
  \ match up their schedules. This year, we are trying a different approach. HQ schedules\
  \ are shorter, but start an hour before the slot starts. We've adjusted the session\
  \ requirements per Tier accordingly and returned the store credit to $10/slot for\
  \ all volunteers.</p> \n    <p>The biggest change, besides HQ volunteer scheduling,\
  \ is the addition of Midnight Madness. Well, midnight is a bit of a misnomer, since\
  \ the slot starts at 2:00 AM. So I'll call it the \"overnight\" slot. We are keeping\
  \ it small as we test the waters and see how many people are up and wanting to game.\
  \ So our games this year run around the clock - (8:00 AM to 1:00 PM, 2:00 PM to\
  \ 7:00 PM, and 8:00 PM to 1:00 AM, 2:00 AM to 7:00 AM), with the exception of Sunday\
  \ (9:00 AM to 2:00 PM). I also need a few volunteers to help set up Wednesday Morning\
  \ and teardown Sunday Afternoon. If you are interested in either of these slots,\
  \ which don't count towards your Tier requirements but do earn store credit and\
  \ pizza, please indicate your interest in the Notes section of the Volunteer Questionnaire.</p>\

  \ putting the call out with the intent that we can let all prospective volunteers\
  \ know their status before the Gen Con housing lottery goes live on February 12th,\
  \ since housing in downtown Indianapolis is at a premium. As a side note, you need\
  \ to have a badge to register for the housing. So if you volunteer as a Tier 3-4\
  \ volunteer and want housing downtown, you must purchase a GM badge from <a href=\"\
  https://www.gencon.com\" target=\"_blank\">Gen Con</a> and proceed to register for\
  \ the lottery. When I receive our GM badge allocation, I will add a GM badge to\
  \ your account and you may request a refund of the badge you purchased. This is\
  \ the only way to access the housing lottery! For Tier 1-2 volunteers, I will send\
  \ your housing information when our block is assigned in June.</p> \n    <p>Related\
  \ to housing is roommate preference. To save my sanity when doing room assignments,\
  \ volunteers may request either one roommate (to fill a bed) or three (to fill a\
  \ room). It is imperative that roomies put each other on their questionnaire—so\
  \ Bob lists Jon and Jon lists Bob and I put them in a room together. If you list\
  \ someone that doesn't list you back, then I do not guarantee you will wind up in\
  \ the same room. There is also a choice for \"no preference\". When assigning rooms,\
  \ I tend to group like together. There is a Notes section of the questionnaire to\
  \ supply more information. If there is anything I should take into consideration\
  \ when placing you in a room, please add it here!</p> \n    <h2>Summary (TL;DR)</h2>\
