  \ of Varisia</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Wednesday, June 6, 2007</p> \n   <p>As\
  \ mentioned in previous blog posts, the Varisian region contains three prominent\
  \ human ethnicities:</p> \n   <p><b>Chelaxian: </b>Monument-haunted Magnimar and\
  \ imperial-minded Korvosa vie for control of southern Varisia. In these cities and\
  \ the numerous vassal settlements of each, the majority of the populace can trace\
  \ their ancestry to the sharp-featured people of Cheliax. Those of Chelish descent\
  \ possess dark hair and eyes contrasted by pale skin—along with a taste for artistic\
  \ fineries and high art.</p> \n   <p><b>Shoanti: </b>Across the northeastern reaches\
  \ of Varisia, the seven ardent tribes of the Shoanti make their homes. A turbulent\
  \ people adhering to traditions unchanged in hundreds of years, these natives live\
  \ harsh lives, preying upon predators and eking what they can from an unforgiving\
  \ land.</p> \n   <p><b>Varisian: </b>Passionate and fiercely independent, Varisians\
  \ (shown in the sketch presented here) lend their name to their homeland. While\
  \ these clannish wanderers can be found in many lands, nowhere are larger populations\
  \ found than in the land of their ancestors.</p> \n   <p>Insular and adhering to\
  \ an ancient, nomadic way of life, extended families of Varisians form wandering\
  \ communities, traveling wherever fate directs them. Varisians don't believe in\
  \ claiming land and thus see no hardship in their nomadic lifestyle. While nature\
  \ provides for most of their needs, these wanderers often visit the cities and towns\
  \ of settled people to trade art and curios from their travels, earn coin by entertaining\
  \ and performing small jobs, and sometimes to con and steal from the unwary—a practice\
  \ indulged often enough to make Varisians widely distrusted and unwelcome by those\
  \ not of their society.</p> \n   <p>The typical Varisian possesses deep olive skin\
  \ and hair that ranges from black to auburn, often worn long by both men and women.\
  \ Customary tattooing leads most to exhibit complex patterns and symbols significantly\
  \ different from those worn by the Shoanti who share their homeland. As wanderers\
  \ and often entertainers, Varisian dress tends toward extremes, from functional\
  \ garb fit for traveling to wildly impractical dress meant to accentuate their dancing,\
  \ exotic tattoos, and naturally fit forms.</p> \n   <p>Wesley Schneider <br>Associate\
