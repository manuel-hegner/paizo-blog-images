    \ he firmly holds a pointed staff upright. It stands taller than him and near\
    \ the top it has a rectangular, almost hammer shaped section with a sitting green\
    \ cat on the side. The man is dressed in pleated brown robes with wide complementary\
    \ stripes, and wears steel shoes. A wide belt carries two buckled pouches on his\
    \ left side, one smaller than the other. He wears a piece of shoulder armor secured\
    \ by by a wide dark red sash with a silver disc attached to protect his joints\
    \ and has a rolled headscarf that is topped by a conic, pointed hat with a green\
    \ ball near the top of the point. He appears to be wearing a shoulder wrap that\

  alt: "Power attack. Two actions. Feat 1. Fighter. Flourish. You unleash a particularly\
    \ powerful attack that clobbers your foe but leaves you a bit unsteady. Make a\
    \ melee Strike. This counts as two attacks when calculating your multiple attack\
    \ penalty. If this Strike hits, you deal an extra die of weapon damage. If you’\
    re at least 10th level, increase this to two extra dice, and if you’re at least\
    \ 18th level, increase it to three extra dice."

  alt: "Brutish Shove. One action. Feat 2. Fighter. Press. Requirements: You are wielding\
    \ a two-handed melee weapon. Description: Throwing your weight behind your attack,\
    \ you hit your opponent hard enough to make it stumble back. Make a Strike with\
    \ a two-handed melee weapon. If you have a target that is your size or smaller,\
    \ that creature is flat-footed until the end of your current turn, and you can\
    \ automatically Shove it, with the same benefits as the Shove action (including\
    \ the critical success effect, if your Strike was a critical hit). If you move\
    \ to follow the target, your movement doesn’t trigger reactions. This Strike has\
    \ the following failure effect: The target becomes flat-footed until the end of\
    \ your current turn."
