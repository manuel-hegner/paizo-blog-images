  artist: "Frank Belknap Long back in 1929 in his short story, \"The Hounds of Tindalos,\"\
    \ but they should be no strangers to those familiar with the Call of Cthulhu roleplaying\
    \ game published by Chaosium (itself one of the longest-lived continually-in-print\
    \ RPGs everâ€”check them out at chaosium.com). Any self-respecting gamer looking\
    \ for more inspiration on the hounds of Tindalos (or cosmic horror of any flavor)\
    \ should certainly check out the huge line of books and adventures that have been\
    \ produced for Call of Cthulhu for more. The actual game stats for the hounds\
    \ as they appear here are pretty different than those"
