  \ a Convention</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Wednesday, January 10, 2018</p> \n \
  \   <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">One of the\
  \ questions I often get asked is \"how do I get organized play events started in\
  \ my area?\" There are many ways to answer this question, and I've turned to Venture-Lieutenant\
  \ Carol Tierney in the UK to give her take. I've known Carol for years and her and\
  \ I started planning conventions together. Before I turn it over to her, a bit of\
  \ background.</p> \n     <p>In July 2010, my husband, Christopher (Crispy), attended\
  \ PaizoCon UK II. He returned to our house excited to continue running and playing\
  \ in the Pathfinder Society Organized Play campaign (PFS). He gathered a few people\
  \ from work and a couple weeks later started advertising Pathfinder Society games.\
  \ He registered it on paizo.com and we started running PFS with event number 2886.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>A year later, we both attended PaizoCon UK III, where he introduced\
  \ me to many people he had been telling me stories about for the prior year. Our\
  \ Society event kept attracting new players (and GMs) and we had a regular Wednesday\
  \ night game. We also added a few new players to our home campaign. One of our home\
  \ players, Jester, asked if their friend, Carol, could come along. \"Of course,\"\
  \ was our answer. Carol and Jester became fixtures of our gaming group. So much\
  \ that they joined us on our pilgrimage to PaizoCon UK IV in 2012.</p> \n     <p>At\
  \ the end of PaizoCon, I asked the visiting Campaign Coordinator, Mike, what I needed\
  \ to do to run a convention and get Paizo support. His answer was short and sweet—\
  \"Plan it and send me an email.\" As we packed up to head home, I mentioned to Carol,\
  \ Jester, and Crispy that all one needed to do to hold a convention was plan the\
  \ event and send an email to Brock. Carol thought this great news. She jumped in\
  \ feet first and we spent the car journey home discussing logistics of our first\
  \ event. CrispyCon (event 15862) occurred 4 months later, in November 2012, with\
  \ over 85 tables of play. CrispyCon II followed in June 2013 and CrispyCon III in\
  \ November 2013, when Chris Brockley-Blatt joined the organization team.</p> \n\
  \     <p>When we left England in 2014, the event had a change of name to 3XP and\
  \ continues to this day. Carol and Chris BB expanded their scope, planning events\
  \ throughout the UK, including the upcoming Contingency in Hampshire, England. Carol\
  \ wrote up her thoughts on planning conventions and I'm taking this opportunity\
  \ to share them with our community. Though we automated some of the event support\
  \ processes, the main criteria for running an event is still, \"plan it and let\
  \ us know!\"</p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p><i>From Carol—</i></p> \n      <p><i>\"\
  The Wyrd Sisters\" started literally because we went to a Pathfinder convention\
  \ and came away thinking we could do that. A dangerous thought which has led to\
  \ Tonya becoming OPM, and Chris Brockley-Blatt and myself taking VO positions in\
  \ the UK. We have also organized several Pathfinder events each year and are now\
  \ two-thirds of the organizing team for Contingency, one of the UKs biggest open\
  \ gaming events. We have also raised £10,000 for charity, made a ton of friends\
  \ and had a huge amount of fun along the way.</i></p> \n      <p><i>So, if you find\
  \ yourself thinking, \"I want to run a convention,\" my advice is to go for it.\
  \ Especially if you are lucky enough to have a fabulous friend or two who is willing\
  \ to do it with you. Don't tell everyone, but Pathfinder/Starfinder conventions\
  \ can be surprisingly easy to run. Of course, an event like Contingency with 500+\
  \ players over 5 days is going to take a stupid amount of work but if you start\
  \ small, you can definitely do it.</i></p> \n      <p><i>Contraption and 3XP are\
  \ at the easy end of con-running. These are one/two day events for between 25 and\
  \ 75 people. Now that we have our systems in place they take very little work. So\
  \ this is our system—hopefully it will encourage you to start your own mini conventions</i></p>\
  \ \n      <p><i>First of all you need to know you have a pool of GMs available to\
  \ run games—when it comes to selling tickets people are going to want to be guaranteed\
  \ a seat in a game in every slot so you can only sell as many tickets as you have\
  \ spaces available. We are lucky enough in the UK to have loads of really great\
  \ GMs who will happily give up their time to attend conventions and run games, but\
  \ if you only have a couple of GMs you need to plan for a smaller event. GMs are\
  \ your greatest asset, so we always try to make them know they are appreciated.\
  \ At the very least, they should get a discount on attending and the chance for\
  \ some time off to play and socialize. If you don't know many GMs talk to your local\
  \ Venture-Officer (VO) team. They can help put you in touch with GMs (and will often\
  \ be willing to run games themselves) - if you can't round up enough GMs your event\
  \ will not work, so make sure you have this step covered before you go any further.</i></p>\
  \ \n      <p><i>Once you have your team sorted, the hardest part is picking the\
  \ right date. There are loads of gaming events on throughout the year, so finding\
  \ a date that's not too close to an existing event can be a challenge and you want\
  \ to avoid clashing with holidays or celebrations where people will want to be with\
  \ their families. In the UK, there are lists of RPG conventions (<a href=\"https://www.philmasters.org.uk/RPGs/conventions.htm\"\
  >https://www.philmasters.org.uk/RPGs/conventions.htm</a> and <a href=\"http://ukroleplayers.com/\"\
  >ukroleplayers.com</a>) plus the Pathfinder/Starfinder events list on paizo.com.\
  \ Make sure you know what is happening and when and once you have your date make\
  \ sure it gets added to any published calendars straight away so no-one else books\
  \ the same date afterwards.</i></p> \n      <p><i>Next, find your location. Contraption\
  \ started in a function room of a pub, 3XP in a community center, but there are\
  \ other options like hotels, conference centers, libraries and church halls. All\
  \ you need is somewhere with decent lighting and enough tables and chairs for everyone\
  \ where your gamers can be kept away from any non-gamers using the same venue. You\
  \ may be able to find a pub that will give you the room for free in return for having\
  \ a captive audience who will buy food and drink throughout the day. If not, there\
  \ are options available in all price brackets.</i></p> \n      <p><i>In the UK.\
  \ most RPG conventions cost around £5 per game slot to attend, so starting small\
  \ with just 2 game sessions and 20 people playing in each gives a budget of £200\
  \ to pay for your venue. Check that the venue hire includes Public Liability Insurance.\
  \ If it doesn't you need to factor that into your budget as well. It should go without\
  \ saying that you should budget based on the minimum attendance you expect. We always\
  \ try to raise money for charity with Wyrd Sisters events, and making sure all the\
  \ costs are covered up front is essential if you are going to do this. Make sure\
  \ you keep a careful eye on the costs. You don't want to end up in debt and your\
  \ venue is the biggest cost. If you keep that affordable you won't go wrong.</i></p>\
  \ \n      <p><i>The last thing you need is a name—ideally something that will stand\
  \ out from the other events so people will remember you, and then you can start\
  \ to promote and organize the event.</i></p> \n      <p><i>The first thing Wyrd\
  \ Sisters do at this stage is set up an event on <a href=\"https://www.warhorn.net/\"\
  >Warhorn</a>. Warhorn is a fantastic resource for anyone organizing gaming events.\
  \ It does all the table planning for you with minimum effort, serves as a website\
  \ for the event, and will even collect your admission fees. Make sure your budget\
  \ includes a donation to keep the site running.</i></p> \n      <p><i>Once the Warhorn\
  \ site is set up and ready to go, write an announcement and post it to every forum\
  \ and social media outlet you can think of. Pro tip—if you set up a Facebook group\
  \ for your event, you can keep people informed in the run up to the event, and going\
  \ forwards the group is where you start next time knowing you will reach your core\
  \ players quickly without having to go looking. Every time you have some news, post\
  \ an update. Don't be surprised if it takes a while for people to sign up, most\
  \ people need to read about something new three or four times before they decide\
  \ to commit to it so you need to keep the event fresh in people's minds. Post when\
  \ games are added to the schedule, talk about your awesome GMs and what they will\
  \ be running, give travel and accommodation updates and so on—keep the conversation\
  \ going.</i></p> \n      <p><i>Do not rely entirely on social media. Ask your gaming\
  \ friends to tell all their gaming friends about the con. Make sure they're all\
  \ coming, invite them personally. Put up flyers for your con in local games shops,\
  \ book shops, etc. If you go to other events take flyers. Send out press releases\
  \ to local news channels. Create a Google Alert for your con. That way, as soon\
  \ as Google notices anyone post about your con, they'll send you an email and you\
  \ can go join the discussion. The easiest mistake you can make is not advertising\
  \ enough. People will only come if they know your event is happening.</i></p> \n\
  \      <p><i>When joining in the discussions remember that you are the face of your\
  \ event. Moaning about players or GMs or anything else related to your event is\
  \ likely to put people off attending. Share the good stuff and you'll make people\
  \ feel enthusiastic for the event.</i></p> \n      <p><i>Once your event is confirmed\
  \ talk to your local VOs /RVC and ask about con support—this is where Paizo really\
  \ excels, there are people who can offer advice and support and if you will be reporting\
  \ 15 or more games of PFS/SFS, you will also qualify for gift vouchers, boons to\
  \ use at the event, and free scenarios for your GMs. You need to apply at least\
  \ 2 months before the event but sooner is better.</i></p> \n      <p><i>Other things\
  \ to consider in the run up to the event: You'll need to make sure people know how\
  \ to get there—check out parking and public transport and make that information\
  \ known. If you are running a two or more day event you'll also need to circulate\
  \ details of where people can stay. People are going to need food/drink. If you\
  \ aren't in a venue that sells food and drink, you'll need to let people know to\
  \ bring their own or where to buy locally. In these days of online takeout ordering\
  \ it's pretty easy, but make sure the venue is ok with people bringing in greasy/smelly\
  \ food. If you want to raise a bit of money for charity think about a tuck shop\
  \ or cake stall. We always have snacks and drinks on offer at 3XP and have found\
  \ the easiest way is to have an honesty pot for donations and let people help themselves.\
  \ Our players are incredibly generous when they know any profit is going to a good\
  \ cause and it means we don't need staff running the stall. We also have unlimited\
  \ tea and coffee on hand, we've found it works best to sell mugs and give away the\
  \ drinks. It's better for the environment than disposable cups and having players\
  \ own the mugs means they do the washing up, not us!</i></p> \n      <p><i>If you\
  \ are using <a href=\"https://www.warhorn.net/\">Warhorn</a>, you can keep track\
  \ of any players who have not found games to play and speak with them before the\
  \ event to make sure this is by choice rather than lack of selection. You'll also\
  \ be able to see which games fill fastest and if any are not working out so you\
  \ can change the schedule if you need to. Check this regularly.</i></p> \n     \
  \ <p><i>On the day, you will want to have a member of staff available at all times.\
  \ There will be questions and hiccups. We usually find that once the first game\
  \ session has started things quiet down, but even if it is really quiet having a\
  \ member of staff available is essential, they will be needed for collecting reporting\
  \ sheets, helping people find games, directing food deliveries, liaising with the\
  \ venue, selling raffle tickets, issuing boons and all sorts of other things you\
  \ won't have thought of before one of your players asks.</i></p> \n      <p><i>People\
  \ always forget what they have signed up to play, so make sure you print out a copy\
  \ of the sign ups from Warhorn and have it handy. This will also come in useful\
  \ when players need to change games. For example, their 8th level character died\
  \ in the last game so they no longer have a character in tier, or they've played\
  \ a few games since they signed up and have leveled up so they are now too high\
  \ for that game or they realize they already played the game they were signed up\
  \ for. You can also use the Warhorn sheet to keep track of the reporting sheets,\
  \ ticking off each game as it is handed on. You can print reporting sheets for the\
  \ games from the event page on paizo.com, make sure you have plenty available as\
  \ reporting games is essential.</i></p> \n      <p><i>If you qualify for boons,\
  \ you'll want to have them printed and prefilled a much as possible so they just\
  \ need to be signed. You'll also need to decide how you are going to distribute\
  \ them. Whether you pick names out of a hat or give them as a reward for good role\
  \ play or heroic deaths, roughly 1 in 10 players should get one.</i></p> \n    \
  \  <p><i>You will need to have a stack of pregenerated characters (pregens) at every\
  \ level available and a few new player numbers. Laminating the pregens means you\
  \ won't have to keep reprinting them every time, especially if you also provide\
  \ a wet erase pen to use with the sheet.</i></p> \n      <p><i>It's always a good\
  \ idea to have a stationery box available with pens, pencils, sharpeners, erasers\
  \ and note paper. Marker pens and colored card are great for quick signage and don't\
  \ forget Blutack and rubbish bags.</i></p> \n      <p><i>If you have Internet access\
  \ in your venue, you can report games as they happen. This is the ideal way of doing\
  \ it, as you'll have access to the players and GMs so can deal with mistakes and\
  \ omissions as they crop up. Mistakes will crop up and not just with the reporting.\
  \ Don't think that is a failing of your event—the only failing is if you don't act\
  \ to sort them out when you notice them. You aren't aiming for perfection, just\
  \ to give people a fun time.</i></p> \n      <p><i>Finally—when the event is over,\
  \ ask for feedback. Ask people what they liked and what they would change and you'll\
  \ get some great ideas which will help you make your next event even better. Trust\
  \ me, there will definitely be a next event, nothing beats the feeling you get when\
  \ you see a room full of happy Pathfinders/Starfinders playing together - reporting,\
  \ exploring and co-operating because you made it happen.</i></p> \n      <p><i>Carol</i></p>\
