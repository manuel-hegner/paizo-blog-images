                   <p itemprop="description">Today we’re going to pull back the curtain on our two upcoming multi-table interactive events for the 2022 Paizo Organized Play season. If you’re not familiar, Pathfinder and Starfinder Organized Play release yearly multi-table events that can be played with as few as three tables and well over 150+ tables at the world’s largest events.

                   <p>Some of you may notice that the level ranges have dipped down a bit from what we’ve previously offered. There are a few reasons for this. We wanted to make sure these events offered a select level range to make it easier for event organizers to run and to ensure that these can be offered easily as walk-up events for new players at events around the world. Secondly, we’re trying to bridge some of the cognitive load that is required to run these events. As of right now there are effectively four scenarios worth of content in one of these interactives. Adding on additional level ranges makes them exceptionally tricky to slot for events and for GMs to prepare for properly. But worry not, we’ll have more high-level content coming in the future (in addition to the always growing repertoire of sanctioned content). Finally,because the workload on interactives is immense, it takes a lot of time and effort for Paizo’s extremely talented staff of developers, editors, and artists to complete. We want to make sure that these events can still continue without adding undue stress or delays on other projects for our staff, so this change is an important step in achieving that goal.</p>

                   <p><em>Starfinder Society #4–99: A Time of Crisis</em> debuts at PaizoCon 2022 and is Organized Play’s first foray into the upcoming <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02aly?Starfinder-Drift-Crisis"><em>Drift Crisis</em></a> event. In this adventure, a large group of Starfinders heads out on a routine archaeological mission, only to find themselves caught in the first event of the Drift Crisis. To survive the challenges to come, groups of characters from local communities or around the world need to come together and work as a team. In this exciting event, we’ll be giving characters the opportunity to answer, “Where were you during the Drift Crash?”—an event that kicks off the Drift Crisis and can be followed-up in all aspects of the Starfinder setting. Written by veteran author Dennis Muldoon, this interactive is intended for 1st to 6th level characters and is split into level range 1–4 and 3–6 to better help event organizers.</p> 
                   <p><em>Pathfinder Society #3–98: Expedition into Pallid Peril</em> is set to release in early August with a GenCon 2022 debut. In this multi-table event, the PCs head into the mountain region of Droskar’s Crag in search of the entrance to a fabled lost dwarven city. Prior expeditions involved lone groups of Pathfinders, such as <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027ni?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-219-Enter-the-Pallid-Peak"><em>Pathfinder Society #2–19: Enter the Pallid Peak</em></a> and more recently <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02apj?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-310-Delve-the-Pallid-Depths"><em>Pathfinder Society #3–10: Delve the Pallid Depths</em></a>. This expedition is the largest yet, with several Pathfinder groups set to explore the mountain ruins in hopes of finding the entrance to the lost dwarven city of Raseri Kanton, which is believed to be lost somewhere within the so-called Pallid Peak. The amazingly talented Rigby Bendele has put together a masterpiece adventure for multiple players. This event is intended for 1st to 6th level characters and is split into level range 1–4 and 3–6 to better help event organizers.</p> 
                   <p>That’s all for today’s blog! Look forward to more information on these interactives as we get closer to the big conventions of the year.</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">The crowd in front of the vast chasm surrounding the Starstone Cathedral was slightly larger today than most days. Visitors from all over Golarion stopped by the great pit every day to marvel at the ancient edifice at its center, to dream of the stone hidden away behind its massive walls, lethal traps, and immortal guardians. It was said that the <em>Starstone</em> granted immeasurable power to any who could touch its crystalline surface and pass the final test of spirit. Those who succeeded became gods. Most simply fell to their deaths in the chasm outside and the rare few who made it in the cathedral were usually never heard from again.</p> 
                   <p>Normally, an attempt by one of the “hopeful” would draw a huge crowd of locals and visitors alike, all interested to see if the would-be god could even make it across the chasm. The celebration was usually all in good fun, if you could call someone risking their life for immortality fun, but it could turn unruly in an instant, the mob demanding the poor soul fling themselves into danger. In either case, it was good business for those of us who ran shops in the Ascendant Court, selling sweet treats and chilled wine. </p> 
                   <p>But not today. </p> 
                   <p>Today was the fourth supposedly prophesized moment of ascension for Dyrani, and business was terrible.</p> 
                   <p>Her first attempt was almost a year ago. The Osiriani woman had only been on the Avenue of the Hopeful for a few weeks at that time, and although she didn’t have a large throng of supporters, she still drew a good crowd to hear her tale and see her make the attempt. For over an hour she spoke of her accomplishments, from the moment of her birth under an auspicious sign, to the tremendous thunderstorm that bore down upon her parent’s small home giving her a connection to the rains and floods, the crops, and the land. The people listened to her claims of connection to the harvest and how she could be counted on to bring rain to struggling farmers and ensure a season of plenty for all upon her ascension. They even saw her plant a simple seed into the ground and encourage it to grow, yet when it came time for her to leap, something changed. She looked out at the chasm and declared that it was not the right time.</p> 
                   <p>“The seed was not yet ready to sprout,” she said, adding that once the plant has matured, she would take the test.</p> 
                   <p>Suffice to say, there were more than a few jeers and cries. But for all the disappointment, Dyrani benefitted quite a bit from the show. For the next few months farmers, gardeners, and food merchants began to stop by her rustic stall on the Avenue and pay their respects to her and the growing plant. They say it never hurts to get in early with new gods. Even if only one in a thousand passed the test, those who do are sure to remember any who believed in them from the start. For my part, I sold a lot of harvest breads and orange tea to her faithful.</p>

                   </div> 
                   <br> 
                   <p>Dyrani even gathered a few devotees to aid in her preparations. She anointed each in a grand ceremony, dubbing them the High Priest of Rains, the High Priestess of Sowing, and the High Priest of Harvest, respectively. They were mostly harmless, wearing ridiculous hats and making pronouncements about the weather. Most would-be-gods attracted a few desperate fools, even when they had nothing to give other than vague promises about the future. The feeling of importance, of belonging was often enough. The avenue was usually cluttered with these supplicants, shouting edicts and making the case for their still-mortal deity. It wasn’t bad for business, really. Most visitors came just to see this spectacle, even if there was no attempt that day. Some of my best days selling sweet pastries have been after a good brawl between the high priests of various would-be faiths. No one wins... except us.</p> 
                   <p>The second attempt was scheduled for later that summer. By this time, Dyrani had amassed a vast crowd of followers, and there was a festival happening in the Grand Bazaar, so the city was swollen with visitors. The Avenue and the Court were packed with people, many of whom began drinking and chanting for Dyrani just after dawn. Her High Priests were there of course, collecting tithes in vast cornucopias made from straw. From the moment I saw them, I knew it was not going to be the day. These hopeful never go through with the test when the coin is flowing freely. There’s still too much to be gained. Later that day, the High Priestess of Sowing pronounced that Dyrani had read the tea leaves (from my stall no less!) and decided that the most auspicious time to take the test would be at the end of the harvest, so that she could prove her worth to all the other gods and make this year a harvest like no other. Fortunately for the harvest deity, another hopeful made the attempt later that afternoon, screaming as he plummeted into the void. I think he wanted to be the god of fish or some such nonsense. </p> 
                   <p>Over the next few months, Dyrani’s appearance changed significantly. Gone were her woolen dresses—now she wore elegant silk embroidered with golden wheat. Her simple grapevine crown was replaced with a wreath of bejeweled golden leaves, and now she carried a massive silver scythe, so that all might know that the goddess of the harvest was near. It had been a good few months for her and her faithful, as the donations came flooding in from visitors and locals alike. But as the end of the harvest drew close, there were signs of stress. </p>
                   <p>The High Priest of Rains quit one afternoon after a heated debate about the upcoming attempt. I think I saw him making poses at the end of the avenue, worshipping another perpetual hopeful. The High Priestess of Sowing stopped working the street for donations after a local gang stole her cornucopia. Only the High Priest of Harvest remained loyal, doing whatever was asked, but he was a zealot, having lost his entire family to famine some years back. I wouldn’t be surprised if he leapt into the pit after Dyrani on her day.</p> 
                   <p>When harvest finally came, the crowd was sizable, but it was clear most didn’t think Dyrani would actually go through with it. All were disappointed when the sacred plant was revealed. It was withered and brown. Defeated, Dyrani called off the attempt, claiming she had been sabotaged by agents of Urgathoa, who wouldn’t dare let such a powerful deity ascend. The boos were some of the loudest I’ve ever heard. Nearly all her supplicants quit in the following days, stealing her finery and looting her treasury.</p> 
                   <p>It was a hard winter for the would-be goddess. By the spring, it was just her and the High Priest of the Harvest. Their clothes were stained, and the silver scythe had been tarnished.</p> 
                   <p>And that brings us to today. My shop is toward the end of the Avenue, right across from the vast chasm surrounding the Cathedral. The spectacle is all but gone. Dyrani has drawn right up to the edge. There’s no cheering, no chants, just silence and the sound of the wind. As the clouds break, a shaft of sunlight illuminates the young woman. She looks exhausted, as most do after their long journey down the Avenue, but as she looks up into the sun, its warmth shining upon her, she steps out, over nothing…</p>

                   <p>In <em>Pathfinder Goblin Firework Fight</em>, you are a goblin rampaging through the small town of Sandpoint, stealing the fireworks from their upcoming festival and using them to cause all sorts of mayhem and panic. At the end of the game, the goblin with the most fireworks will be crowned winner and the “bestest goblin of the raid!” </p> 
                   <p>The game is played over a number of rounds. Each round, every goblin gets to take one loot token from the town’s treasure pile. These tokens might represent useful tools or valuable treasure, like fireworks, dogslicers (goblin knives), or shields. Unfortunately, the tribe’s most fearsome beast, a pig called Squealy Nord, is also hiding in the treasure, bringing mayhem and chaos to any who draw his token from the pile. You never know what you might get!</p> 
                   <p>The game continues until the town’s pile of loot tokens is empty and the goblin with the most fireworks is declared the winner! </p> 
                   <p>Available for preorder now in the webstore, <em>Pathfinder Goblin Firework Fight</em> is the first stand-alone game from Paizo in years, and is slated for a March 30, 2022 release.</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">Hello Starfinders!<br> Earlier this month, we announced Starfinder Society Year 5: <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shz7?Starfinder-Society-Year-5-Announcement#25">Year of Redemption’s Rise</a>. While the previous blog post is packed full of information on the year itself, today we’re focusing on one of the two new factions you can expect to see in the Year of Redemption’s Rise: the Advocates!</p> 
                   <h2>The Advocates</h2> 
                   <p>When Zigvigix, former leader of the Exo-Guardians, emerged from their recent convalescence to find the Starfinder Society splitting apart at the seams, their heart broke. They had suffered more than most during the Data Scourge, but they still sympathized with those around them: the citizens whose lives were upended or cut short and the Starfinders who felt shame and suspicion. Determined to mend the widening rifts between agents and offer them the support they needed to recover, Ziggy founded a new faction: the Advocates. </p> 
                   <table class="image" align="left"> 
                    <caption align="bottom" style="font-size: 13px;">

                     </tr> 
                    </tbody>
                   </table> 
                   <p>Ziggy’s passion, heart, and understanding caused the faction’s ranks to quickly swell. Members of the Advocates are sometimes referred to as “Heartloves” as a nod to both their mission and Ziggy’s favorite band (Strawberry Machine Cake).</p> 
                   <p><b>Faction Leader</b>: Zigvigix (LG host shirren soldier) was a long-standing member of the Exo-Guardians. They suffered severe injuries prior to the Scoured Stars, which prevented them from taking part in that ill-fated expedition. Despite being overwhelmed with survivor’s guilt, Zigvigix took up leadership of the remaining Exo-Guardians. During the Data Scourge, they were taken prisoner by the Scourge’s perpetrator, who later used the shirren’s cybernetics to infect Guidance with a corrupting virus. Zigvigix tore out their own cybernetic implants to prevent the digital infection from spreading and has only recently recovered from the ordeal. Though Zigvigix admits they have much healing to do, they take comfort in their relationship with Celita, their favorite sugar-pop music, and the support of their colleagues and community.</p> 
                   <p><b>Motto</b>: We’re here for you!</p> 
                   <p><b>Year 5 Goal</b>: The Advocates aim to heal the widening rifts between factions, unite the squabbling Starfinder agents into an accepting, loving, and supportive community, and encourage the Starfinder Society to do good throughout the Pact Worlds and beyond.</p>

                   <br> 
                   <p><b>Boons</b>: Like all our factions, the Advocates have a slate of unique boons available for purchase with Achievement Points by members of the Advocates faction with the appropriate amount of Reputation. Today we’re revealing three of these boons! Note that these boons are not yet final and may change slightly before release.</p> 
                   <p><b>Loyal Friend (Slotless Boon)</b>:<br> Your strong bonds of friendship help center your thoughts. You gain a +1 morale bonus to saving throws against the confused condition. When you have the confused condition and would be forced to attack an ally, you instead do nothing but babble incoherently.<br> <b>Requirements</b>: 5+ Reputation with Advocates<br> <b>AcP Cost</b>: 2</p> 
                   <p><b>Protector’s Offense (Slotless Boon)</b>:<br> You’ve trained to protect your allies from harm as often as you protect yourself. When you successfully strike a target with a melee attack using a weapon with the block special property and increase your AC against that target, your adjacent allies gain a +1 enhancement bonus to their AC for 1 round against melee attacks from that same target. This bonus only applies as long as they remain adjacent to you.<br> <b>Requirements</b>: 15+ Reputation with Advocates<br> <b>AcP Cost</b>: 4</p> 
                   <p><b>Determined Medic (Slotless Boon)</b>:<br> You’ve trained for innumerable emergency situations and are a capable combat medic in a pinch. Once per adventure as a standard action, you can treat a willing, adjacent creature to remove one of the following conditions: frightened, nauseated, paralyzed, shaken, sickened, or staggered. This doesn’t end the effect that caused the condition, and the target can regain the condition from any source as normal.<br> <b>Requirements</b>: 25+ Reputation with Advocates<br> <b>AcP Cost</b>: 4</p> 
                   <p>I hope you’ve enjoyed this sneak peek at the upcoming Advocates faction! Come back at the end of the month when we reveal information on the Cognates!</p> 
                   <p>Wishing you all the best, Starfinders! Take care of each other out there.</p>

Please note these signups are <b>only</b> for the physical event in Indianapolis. Once Gen Con provides us with more information about their timeline for Gen Con Online, we’ll be in touch with volunteer information.</p> 
                   <p>Before you fill out the volunteer form, here is some important information:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>Volunteer applications will be reviewed and accepted or rejected by the Gen Con Organizing Committee. Filling this form out <b>does not guarantee acceptance</b>; you will receive an email with further information from the Gen Con committee.</li> 
                    <li>Gen Con Indy schedules will be <b>assigned</b> by the committee. You will be asked for your preference of system and level, but you will not necessarily be able to choose the specific scenario(s) you run. The committee’s intention is to assign people to run the same scenario multiple times during the weekend. There is a free-form field at the end of the form to enter specific requests, though there’s no guarantee they will be honored.</li> 
                    <li>Reward information is listed on the <a href="https://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/communities/paizo/popvo/">Organized Play Foundation website</a>. GMs who don’t qualify for a badge will still need to purchase one.</li> 
                    <li><b>IMPORTANT NOTE FOR 2022</b>: Paizo has a very limited number of rooms for GMs. In the past, we have been able to guarantee all 7-slot GMs will be housed; this is <b>not guaranteed for 2022</b>. Please see <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x6JsIvle-OfFWYE2uXl2pxb8NdrshY_0z5v_1MdkAts/edit?usp=sharing">this document</a> for more information.</li> 
                    <li>Volunteers will be accepted on a rolling basis and schedules should be assigned within a week of your application. Once your schedule is assigned and you confirm, you are considered to be committed to attending the event.</li> 
                    <li>Adventure authors interested in running tables of scenarios they have written should fill out the volunteer form and then follow up by emailing genconleads@gmail.com. Please note we have a limited number of tables and the schedule is fairly locked-in at this stage, but we’ll do our best to get you slotted into your scenario if it’s on the schedule.</li> 
                    <li>In-person attendees and guests will be required to show proof of vaccination and wear masks. Other venues in the area (such as the hotels) may have less stringent requirements in common areas. Therefore, we will enforce our requirements in Paizo-controlled spaces such as the Sagamore ballroom. Failure to comply may result in your expulsion and a potential ban from future major conventions.</li> 
                    <li>Any questions about the GM signup process should be sent to the committee at genconleads@gmail.com.</li>

                   <h2>Advice For Publishers</h2> 
                   <p>Over the 5+ months Pathfinder and Starfinder Infinite have been live, I’ve noticed some trends in what seems to resonate with the audience, what sells well, and what makes the content creators the most money for their effort and passion. I thought I’d take this opportunity to pass on some advice for the benefit of the entire Infinite community, but specifically for the benefit of those of you who are putting time and efforts into making products for the platforms.</p> 
                   <p>First, a good cover goes a long way. I can’t stress how important even a single image and readable text are on your cover. Even using one of the many monster or NPC illustrations that have been made available on the Paizo Blog over the years, or in the Pathfinder/Starfinder Infinite art packs, seems to have a noticeable effect on sales. If you’re having trouble deciding what image to use, or can’t figure out how to use the templates provided on the Infinite platform, consider reaching out to other community creators for help and advice. Everyone can remember their first attempt, and most folks are happy to pay their knowledge and experience forward (as long as you aren’t expecting them to lay out your entire book.)</p> 
                   <p>Second, proofread your product description! While a picture is worth a thousand words, if one of the few dozen words someone can see before deciding to buy a product is misspelled, that word is an outlier and certainly worth an entire picture unto itself. Run any text the public is going to see by a second set of eyes, even if it’s a significant other, member of your gaming group, or a friend online. It’s easy to overlook our own mistakes, and often something we’ve overlooked a dozen times will be immediately caught by someone on their first readthrough. How you describe your product is as important as the product itself, so give that sales copy one extra read before you post it.</p> 
                   <p>Next, consider making content that specifically supports or builds on new or popular releases, be it additional NPCs or encounters for an Adventure Path, shops and plot hooks for a region or settlement, or a short story set in the leadup to or aftermath of a major event in the setting. It’s been a few months since folks got their hands on <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02ap2?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Absalom-City-of-Lost-Omens"><em>Absalom, City of Lost Omens</em></a>, and we’re going to start promoting Absalom-based content with a special banner and other marketing pushes. Expect similar support for the forthcoming Starfinder Drift Crisis meta-event and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02aly?Starfinder-Drift-Crisis">hardcover</a>. And eventually, we’d love to have enough content tied to specific APs to break those out into their own content hubs. Such publications have a built-in audience of GMs and players who are already invested in the associated campaigns and can increase your products’ reach and sales.</p> 
                   <p>Finally, don’t undervalue your work. While the options to make your product free or pay what you want exist, far too often publishers fall back on these due to a lack of confidence in their work’s ability to sell at higher prices. Don’t do that! You worked hard on your product and people will give you money for it. My experience has shown that they’ll usually give you another 20-50% more than you think it’s worth. So, if you’re stuck at pricing your product, have some faith in yourself and the quality of your work and set it for $2, $5, whatever, instead of setting that same amount as a suggested price. Products offered for free (or free transactions of pay-what-you-want products) also don’t get counted by the site’s algorithms when determining bestsellers or best-seller badges, so even something getting a lot of downloads isn’t necessarily going to get more attention after if falls off the new releases list.</p> 
                   <h2>Other DriveThruRPG News</h2> 
                   <p>While not directly Infinite-related, I wanted to also draw attention to other offerings on the DriveThruRPG storefront. Most notably, we’ve now got nearly 20 out-of-print Pathfinder titles available for Print-on-Demand, including all 4 out-of-print volumes of the Shattered Star Adventure Path, <a href="https://www.pathfinderinfinite.com/product/359514/Pathfinder-Module-The-Emerald-Spire-Superdungeon-PF1?affiliate_id=2791261"><em>The Emerald Spire Superdungeon</em></a> (in hard- and soft-cover), the <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/359637/Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-1-Burnt-Offerings-Rise-of-the-Runelords-1-of-6Limited-Edition-cover?affiliate_id=2791261">Karzoug limited edition cover of Pathfinder AP #1, and both </a><a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/369643/GameMastery-Module-D0-Hollows-Last-Hope"><em>Hollow’s Last Hope</em></a> and <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/374105/GameMastery-Module-D1-Crown-of-the-Kobold-King?affiliate_id=2791261"><em>Crown of the Kobold King</em></a> in their original 3.5 incarnations (look for their Pathfinder Second Edition conversions in the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02ase?Pathfinder-Adventure-Crown-of-the-Kobold-King-Anniversary-Edition?affiliate_id=2791261"><em>Crown of the Kobold King Anniversary Edition</em></a> coming later this year). You can also find digital versions of all of the Pathfinder comics from our partners at <a href="https://www.pathfinderinfinite.com/browse/pub/20642/Dynamite-Entertainment?affiliate_id=2791261">Dynamite Entertainment</a> and Pathfinder and Starfinder material in other languages from our translation partners like <a href="https://www.pathfinderinfinite.com/browse/pub/3963/Devir?affiliate_id=2791261">Devir</a> and <a href="https://www.pathfinderinfinite.com/browse/pub/3444/Ulisses-Spiele?affiliate_id=2791261">Ulisses Spiele</a>. Keep your eyes peeled for new Pathfinder Tales short fiction available in eBook format for the first time, coming soon exclusively to DriveThruFiction.</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">Today, Owlcat Games and META Publishing have launched Inevitable Excess – the first story DLC for <em>Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous</em> together with a major free update (patch 1.2).</p>

                   <p>The Inevitable Excess DLC will take players on new adventures set just before the moment of their greatest triumph: victory over the Worldwound. The new story will require all the hero's high-level abilities and mythic powers to battle with near invincible opponents.</p> 
                   <p>Areelu Vorlesh's experiment was about more than just Golarion and the Abyss. Many powerful entities could not stay away from the war between mortals and demons. Some participated personally, while others observed from afar, asking questions – is this experiment too dangerous for Golarion, for the planes, for the universe? And as the hero of the Fifth Crusade strode toward the inevitable battle with Areelu Vorlesh, the primordial inevitable Valmallos, the keeper of magic, sensed an impending threat to the universe, and turned to the Commander.</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>Play a new story that complements the main campaign storyline. Import your character from the main campaign with all their companions, or create a new one to find out what exactly has troubled the keeper of magic.</li> 
                    <li>At the beginning of the adventure, the character will be high level – with both standard and mythic options available. Fight new mythic opponents who threaten the peace of the planes. Use your entire arsenal of mythic abilities!</li> 
                    <li>Visit Axis – the birthplace and home of the inevitables, the machine aeons, exploring every corner of this plane and finding a way through a dungeon full of dangers.</li> 
                    <li>Export achievements to the main campaign. After completing this DLC, new powers will become available to the character in the main campaign right before the official start of the Fifth Crusade.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p>The DLC is available as a part of the Season Pass, as well as via a standalone purchase on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1184370/Pathfinder_Wrath_of_the_Righteous/">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/pathfinder_wrath_of_the_righteous">GOG</a>, and the <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/p/pathfinder-wrath-of-the-righteous">Epic Games Store</a> for $12.99.</p> 
                   <p>A new patch (1.2) is now available and features over 500 tweaks and fixes for the crusade, various mythic paths, and other aspects of the game. The full list of updates can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSyKg5gyNmZvnDgCWkexGufi1Sh4s-qkBVATeN-zRgFQL-m2CiCJjdkqquepApKGvaK0m5cOOBr-XPB/pub">here</a>.</p>

                   <p>For those waiting patiently for Gen Con volunteer information, I’m meeting with the Gen Con committee this week to work on putting the final pieces into place. I’m hoping to have volunteer signups open in the next couple of weeks.</p>

                   <p><a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shz7?Starfinder-Society-Year-5-Announcement">As we announced last week</a>, Year 5 of Starfinder Society is titled “Year of Redemption’s Rise!” We’ll be launching this year’s storyline at PaizoCon 2022, both online and at the physical show, with three brand-new scenarios. Strap in, Starfinders, and get ready for a year like you’ve never seen!</p> 
                   <p>It was also announced that five new species will be made always-available, and three new factions will be opened up to all Starfinders. Information on these changes, as well as any other new rule changes, will be discussed further in a blog prior to PaizoCon focused specifically on these changes. We don’t have any other major program changes planned at this time, but if we change course, we’ll be sure to let you know well before PaizoCon.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h2>Sanctioning</h2> 
                   <p>We didn’t have any new material sanctioned this month, mostly because there wasn’t much more material to sanction yet! Behind the scenes, we’re starting to work on <em>Book of the Dead</em>, which I anticipate we’ll have ready for its street date. We’re also working on polishing off sanctioning for the <em>Tyrant’s Grasp</em> AP, the last of our PF1 Adventure Paths to be sanctioned, and we’re looking ahead to <em>Lost Omens Knights of Lastwall</em>, the <em>Quest for the Frozen Flame</em> and <em>Horizons of the Vast</em> APs, and even the <em>Drift Crisis</em> rulebook. </p> 
                   <p>While I have you all here, there were a couple other topics I wanted to touch on.</p> 
                   <p><b>Retroactive Sanctioning:</b> In the past, there have been questions about how to handle chronicle sheets for adventures that have been sanctioned after a group completes the adventure. Previously the guidance has been that while this is technically illegal, there were ways to skirt the system by having a fake wrap-up session, which is silly and weird, so I’m doing away with that loophole.</p> 
                   <p>Going forward, if an adventure is sanctioned after your group completes it, your GM is <b>absolutely permitted</b>. (and encouraged!) to issue chronicles for all interested players. These chronicles should be applied as if your group had finished the session on the day you receive the chronicle. You couldn’t, for example, retroactively apply it to a character at an earlier date and bump all their future chronicles up in level; this breaks the timestream and makes the Hounds of Tindalos mad.</p> 
                   <p><b>Updated Sanctioning Documents:</b> Wayyyyy back in August we <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shrt?Organized-Play-Update-Increased-Rewards-for">announced an update to our sanctioning documents</a> and the increase in Reputation that would come along with it. And then, y’know, we had a busy few months. However, I am now pleased to announce that the project has been finished! All sanctioning documents have been fully updated and should reflect the most recent version of the rules. Please let me know if you encounter any issues!</p> 
                   <p>Normally this would be where I’d put GM Recognition, but this month I don’t have any new 5-rank GMs to announce. Instead, I’ll just thank all our GMs, especially those who have volunteered already for PaizoCon and Gen Con. You’re all fantastic and we literally wouldn’t be able to do this without you!</p> 
                   <p>Until next time - Explore! Report! Cooperate! And don’t forget to sign up for PaizoCon!</p>

                   <h2>SUPPLY RUN</h2> 
                   <p itemprop="description">Droven could hardly believe the twists and turns the last few days had taken. Month after month, season after season, he’d traveled the continent of Arcadia, searching for passage back to Absalom, an ocean away in the region known as the Inner Sea. He had spent more than a few days in the last weeks carefully examining the soles of his metal-reinforced boots. Long ago, he’d promised one of the first friends he’d made in Arcadia, an old half-orc named Darv, that if he still hadn’t found a way back to Absalom by the time the soles of wore thin, he’d return to Darv’s workshop to begin a new life.</p> 
                   <p>Instead, Droven had inadvertently aided one of his closest friends from the Inner Sea, the goblin alchemist Fumbus, in a daring rescue against a gang of smugglers, the Wreckers. Fumbus’s rescued friends were a powerful old wizard named Ezren, a wise young cleric named Kyra, a cunning elf named Merisiel, and a valiant warrior called Valeros.</p> 
                   <p>Droven had at first been afraid to tell the others they were as stranded as he was, but after some discussion the group realized that they had almost everything they needed to make the journey back to Absalom. Ezren and Kyra’s magic could calm the worst of the storms and turn the currents in their favor, while Valeros’s strength and Merisiel’s cunning, combined with Droven’s and Fumbus’s ingenuity, would allow them to build a sturdy enough sea craft from the salvage of the Wreckers’ victims. </p> 
                   <p>The biggest problem was the lack of any known eastward currents bridging the Arcadian Ocean to the continents of Avistan and Garund. Droven had heard tales of the legendary current carrying Ulfen vikings to Port Valen in northern Arcadia and had even seen the maps of the sea routes between Arcadia and Tian Xia, which shared a northern land bridge with Avistan. Frustratingly, the northern route was only one way and the western route presented unique geographic barriers Droven had never been able to surmount. Making the trek in either direction, even accompanied by a group of stalwart adventurers, was a fraught journey that would take months at least.</p> 
                   <p>Instead, Droven had a plan that this group’s unique talents were particularly suited for. While Valeros and company assembled a ship based on Droven’s blueprints, the half-orc, his construct companion Whirp, and Fumbus would venture into the abandoned lair of a reckless alchemist in the nearby jungles to retrieve the materials necessary to assemble an alchemical engine capable of propelling their craft across the Arcadian Ocean, regardless of winds or currents.</p> 
                   <p>Droven had marked the laboratory the first time he’d passed along this stretch of coast over a year ago, though he’d been unwilling to delve too deep after encountering various alchemical traps. But now, with the possibility of home so close and a trusted companion at his side, Droven felt it worth the risk.</p>

                   <p>“Droven!”</p> 
                   <p>“Yes, Fumbus?”</p> 
                   <p>“Ice?”</p> 
                   <p>“I’m sorry my friend, I’m afraid I don’t take your meanin–GAAH!”</p> 
                   <p>Droven and Fumbus had bypassed a variety of traps and strange monsters to the facility’s primary laboratory. Things had been going remarkably well, with inventor, construct, and alchemist each uniquely suited to disable the dangers laid by the paranoid alchemist who’d built the place. Droven blamed himself for their current predicament, trapped in a sealed room with an angry ooze climbing out of a broken glass tank.</p> 
                   <p>Shaking the sting of an acidic tendril from his non-mechanical arm, Droven yelled for Whirp. “Defensive formation zero zero three: barricade!”</p> 
                   <p>Responding to his maker’s command, Whirp leapt between his allies and the approaching ooze, deploying thin, folded metal sheets within his chassis to create a temporary barricade. As Droven ducked behind it, Fumbus cleared his throat.</p>

                   <br> 
                   <p>“Miss you, Droven” Fumbus said, ducking an acidic pseudopod and swirling a blue cannister around in his hand. “Ice?”</p> 
                   <p>Droven’s good eye widened in surprise as he finally realized what the goblin was asking. “Yes, Fumbus! As much as you’ve got!”</p> 
                   <p>Fumbus hurled the cannister at the ooze, freezing a portion of its body but barely slowing its advance. As Droven fired a crossbow bolt into the ooze’s mass only to watch it dissolve, he realized Fumbus’s concoctions might be their only salvation. “More ice, Fumbus, quickly!”</p> 
                   <p>Fumbus’s right hand snatched an empty glass vial from one of his pouches while his left darted from his tiled necklace to his pouches, and up… into his mouth. Furiously chewing each component before spewing the macerated remains into his vial, Fumbus quickly created a second vial of liquid ice and launched it at the encroaching ooze before repeating the process.</p> 
                   <p>Droven took careful aim at a frozen section of ooze before firing his crossbow. As the icy chunk shattered into pieces, Droven was relieved to see that the ooze seemed to shrink, its regeneration stymied by the freezing cold. As Fumbus threw yet another liquid ice bomb, Droven glanced at his friend and suppressed a worried frown. Fumbus smiled at Droven, but the goblin’s saliva was frozen to his chin in icicles of drool, and his green skin had taken on a distinctly bluish hue. Worse, the goblin’s teeth chattered furiously, slowing down the liquid ice process. Seeing Fumbus’s predicament, Droven quickly removed a few mechanical components from his backpack. He’d been working on something the local Arcadians called a “cryomister,” a device intended to release a controlled stream of freezing liquid. Droven had been struggling to complete it due to his lack of familiarity with Arcadian alchemy, but Fumbus possessed exactly what Droven lacked.</p> 
                   <p>“Fumbus! Pour everything you’ve got into this!”</p> 
                   <p>Fumbus snatched up the proffered device and spewed all the components in his mouth directly into its ammunition cartridge. Trying hard not to think about what had just happened, Droven took the device back, activated it, and tossed it at the broken glass tank from which the ooze poured. As the cryomister sank into the acidic flow, chilling fog poured forth, solidifying the ooze until only a blue-green statue remained.</p> 
                   <p>Wiping shards of frozen drool from his chin, Fumbus wasted no time in sacking the lab, quickly identifying a variety of ingredients and reagents capable of fueling the alchemical engine Droven intended to build. Struggling to his feet, Droven leaned on Whirp’s body. His good arm was burned by acid, and he felt the weight of his prosthetic limb keenly as he struggled to stand. The two friends and friendly construct quickly gathered the materials they would need to assemble their engine.</p> 
                   <p>“Droven?”</p> 
                   <p>“Yes, Fumbus?”</p> 
                   <p>“Oozes terrible.”</p> 
                   <p>“Yeah, Fumbus. They’re pretty bad.”</p>

                   <h2>BEACH PARTY</h2> 
                   <p itemprop="description">“Whirp–click?” the tiny construct asked of Droven, who rotated the lenses of a pair of clockwork glasses he’d been tinkering with.</p> 
                   <p>“Hush now, little Whirp.” The half-orc placed a hand on the construct’s metal head. Farther down the beach—just within range of what the inventor could see through the darkness of early evening—a noisome band of pirates and smugglers gathered around a cooking fire obstructed by enough foliage to remain hidden from passing ships. The flames made it hard for Droven to calibrate his goggles as he looked on from the northern flank.</p> 
                   <p>“Wreckers," Droven said quietly. The nomads had warned him about them—and for good reason. Just beyond the campfire, a half dozen captives remained locked inside a stockade. The structure looked sturdy, despite being crafted from driftwood and detritus collected from the beach. Many of the prisoners had been hog-tied. Others were yoked in makeshift stocks.</p> 
                   <p>“I believe the Wreckers caught bigger fish than they meant to fry,” Droven said, adjusting his position. “Someone must have stripped and dumped the bodies we found near the tree line. I bet the smugglers ambushed the prisoners and overpowered them, but not before several were lost in the fray.” He exhaled. “Which would mean they desecrated the bodies of their own compatriots. Not much of a retirement plan if you ask me.”</p> 
                   <p>“Bzzzzt–click” Whirp said, tugging desperately at the inventor’s arm. Droven didn’t need months exploring the Arcadian coastline with the construct to know what that meant. He dropped his goggles and spun to draw his hammer as Whirp gestured frantically toward the small hillock’s only safe pathway. Someone had snuck near their position, leaving obvious tracks behind. Droven glanced over his shoulder. The drop was too far to know whether he could leap down to the sands below and keep his footing.</p> 
                   <p>“Ho there! I warn you; I am armed and no easy prey. Allow me to negotiate for the release of your prisoners and the cessation of attacks against the ships passing by this shoreline. Otherwise, prepare for battle!”</p> 
                   <p>A pair of Wrecker scouts stepped out from the underbrush. A woman outstretched her arm to reveal a spider with barbed fur clamped around her wrist like a living gauntlet. The puckering spinneret twitched toward Droven, causing the inventor to tighten his grip on the hammer. The weapon was almost certainly a beast gun. He’d seen enough of them to know it possessed the abilities of the spider whose body it was constructed from. If he didn’t act first, he and Whirp would be enveloped in spiderweb and rolled down the embankment. Some heroes they would be—wrapped up like two helpless caterpillars in silk cocoons.</p> 
                   <p>Droven whistled sharply and dropped to his stomach. Whirp planted its spindly arms in the dirt and somersaulted toward the Wreckers, just before detonating in a roiling ball of flame. The inventor had rigged the little construct to explode on command, knowing it would survive the blast largely unharmed. The same could not be said of the two smugglers who rolled on the ground to extinguish their burning clothes. Droven rushed forward and struck each of their skulls with the hammer, holding back just enough of his strength to leave them alive. At least, he hoped. Neither strike had drawn much blood.</p>

                   <br> 
                   <p>It was only a matter of time before the explosion attracted other Wreckers, though with any luck the crest of the hillock obscured most of the remaining flames. Droven kicked sand over the parts of the smugglers that still smoldered and bound them with lengths of spare wire. He and Whirp had better move fast. But not before he snatched the spidery beast gun which had been so kindly gifted to them.</p> 
                   <p>“Point and click, right, Whirp?” Droven snapped the weapon in place atop his forearm, suppressing a grimace as its tiny hairs pricked his skin.</p> 
                   <p>The sounds of shouting in the distance grew louder. The inventor tapped Whirp on the shoulder, signaling the construct to collapse into a light carrying case. Droven scooped up his companion by its clockwork arm-turned-handle and dashed into the trees. </p> 
                   <p>Sliding behind some foliage, Droven steadied his stolen weapon on top of the little construct’s condensed body. Two triggers protruded from the abdomen of the taxidermic spider. He was reasonably confident that depressing the first would fire a net of silk webbing. He had no inkling about the second. There was only one way to find out. </p> 
                   <p>As the first Wrecker came into sight, Droven pulled the first trigger—only to discover the absurdity of his assumption. A barbed hair launched from the spider and stabbed the pirate in the neck. The smuggler collapsed to the ground in spastic convulsions just before growing still. Droven moved to the body, placing his hand on the Wrecker’s neck. No pulse. Droven struggled against the dread coalescing in the pit of his stomach. As much as the inventor detested unnecessary violence, his foe had undoubtedly met the same fate as the many innocent victims who crossed the pirates’ path. Perhaps he could find some solace in that.</p> 
                   <p>When the next smuggler came into sight, Droven pulled the second trigger. The beast gun fired the webbing he’d expected before, provoking a sigh of relief. The web spiraled outward from the beast gun, pinning the Wrecker to a nearby tree as it wrapped circles around the trunk. As the pirate pleaded for someone to cut him free, Droven realized he and his companion could soon find themselves outnumbered. He tapped Whirp once more and the tiny construct unfolded into its bipedal form. Pulling a pair of boots sized for the construct out of his backpack, Droven quickly fitted them onto Whirp’s stubby legs.</p> 
                   <p>“Lead them on a merry chase and then meet me at their bonfire. Understood?”</p> 
                   <p>“Whirrrrrrrpup–click–whirrrrrr!” the construct said in response, slamming its tiny heels together to activate the blast boots. Whirp rocketed skyward through the trees; its path lit by twin tails of flame. </p> 
                   <p>Droven moved quickly through the woods, heading toward the Wreckers’ bonfire and, most importantly, the stockade. When he arrived at camp, he slowed to sneak carefully behind the pair of guards who remained. As he moved, he pictured the rest of the Wreckers struggling to keep up as they chased the flash of Whirp’s fiery trail through the darkness. He smiled and shifted his hammer to his prosthetic hand. Droven rapped both pirates with a single flourish that would have been all but impossible with a limb comprised of flesh and blood. His last remaining enemies slumped to the ground unceremoniously, knocked cold.</p> 
                   <p>Droven dashed toward the prison. After releasing a small blade integrated into his metal arm, he slashed through the ropes that tied the door shut. He moved toward the nearest prisoner: a cleric bearing a silver symbol of Sarenrae who had been muffled with a cloth gag. Droven slid his blade softly under the fabric, gently enough to avoid piercing the prisoner’s cheek, and pulled. He cut her free just in time to make out, “–hind you!”</p> 
                   <p>Droven turned to behold his grave mistake. Three Wreckers remained behind, not two. The pirate Droven failed to spot had her own beast gun, this one made from the neck and maw of a fire-breathing drake.</p> 
                   <p>“Oi! Drop the gun!” the woman shouted.</p> 
                   <p>Hoping not to alarm her, Droven disconnected the spider gun from his arm and let it fall to the ground.</p> 
                   <p>“Thought you could steal from the Wreckers, eh? ‘Fraid we’re going to have to make an example out of you! Any last words?” She leveled the drake gun at Droven. </p> 
                   <p>Droven couldn’t help but glance toward the sky. Some twenty feet above the Wrecker, two thin lines of fire bisected the night sky. </p> 
                   <p>“Last words? Why, yes, I do have some.” Droven stifled a grin. “I’m afraid that you failed to account… for the powerful bond of friendship!” As the inventor yelled, he activated a large magnet attached to a disposable electric reservoir in his prosthetic arm. The magnetic force drew Whirp—who hovered above he and the Wrecker thanks to the blast boots Droven had fitted the construct with—down toward the inventor’s arm.</p> 
                   <p>The smuggler fired, unleashing a blast of flame from her drake gun. But it was too late. The little construct twisted its metallic body and absorbed the brunt of the explosion, shielding Droven from harm.</p> 
                   <p>Droven remembered the blade on his prosthetic hand. Just before he moved to strike, a thunderous explosion forced him to duck behind Whirp. When he peaked back over the construct’s shoulder, the Wrecker lie prone, screaming, and thrashing—totally enveloped in flame. Despite burning alive, she staggered to her feet and pointed the drake gun once more—first at Whirp, then at Droven.</p> 
                   <p>A small figure stepped out of the shadows behind her, holding a vial of alchemist’s fire in hand. Droven’s jaw dropped in disbelief.</p> 
                   <p>"Fumbus?" he coughed. “Where did you come from?” But Droven heard no words in response.</p> 
                   <p>Just another boom. </p>

                   <p>There are six Starfinder Society Scenarios that directly influence the Year of Redemption's Rise metaplot. Like last year, each will be marked with a special metaplot icon on the cover. Scenarios without this icon are adventures that don't directly tie into the events of Year of Redemption's Rise. However, these adventures still touch on this year's themes: reconciliation, redemption, heroism, and doing good in a galaxy that's got some tough times on the horizon.</p> 
                   <p>The Year of Redemption's Rise metaplot kicks off with <em>Starfinder Society Intro: Year of Redemption's Rise</em>, an adventure for levels 1–4 written by our very own Alex Speidel! This scenario marks Alex's first foray into writing Starfinder Society scenarios, and I promise he did not disappoint! This scenario debuts at PaizoCon 2022, alongside two other Starfinder Society Scenarios. While I recommend you begin your journey into this Year's metaplot with the <em>Year of Redemption's Rise</em>, the remaining scenarios in this year's metaplot can be played in any order.</p> 
                   <p>A new Year isn't the only exciting news I've got up my sleeve! I'm pleased to announce that the following five races are being moved to always available as of the beginning of Year 5: dragonkin, pahtra, sarcesian, shobhad, and vlaka. Additionally, the Year of Redemption's Rise shines a spotlight on some of the Starfinder Society's minor factions: the already established Manifold Host, and the brand-new Advocates and Cognates factions! More information on these three factions will be released right here, on the Paizo blog, in a few weeks.</p> 
                   <p>Want to learn more about the Year of Redemption's Rise or the Advocates? Check out the following interviews!</p>

                   <h2>GM/HQ Signups</h2> 
                   <p>GM and HQ signups for PaizoCon 2022 are now open! The form is linked below; before you fill it out, there are some important pieces of information you should know.</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>Volunteer applications will be reviewed and accepted or rejected by the PaizoCon Organizing Committee. Filling this form out <b>does not guarantee acceptance</b>; you will receive an email with further information from the PaizoCon committee.</li> 
                    <li>Reward information is listed <a href="https://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/communities/paizo/popvo/">on the Organized Play Foundation website</a>. GMs who do not qualify for a badge will still need to purchase one; no hotel rooms are offered for PaizoCon, so volunteers will need to arrange their own accommodations.</li> 
                    <li>Applications submitted before <b>March 17</b> will be guaranteed to be cleared in time for priority GM signups. Volunteers will be accepted as space and time permit on a rolling basis after this date.</li> 
                    <li>Adventure authors interested in running tables of scenarios they have written should fill out this form and then follow up by emailing paizoorgplayhq@gmail.com. Anybody interested in running games outside of the Organized Play offerings (such as Infinite content, homebrew content, or games from other publishers) should email paizocon@paizo.com for more information about scheduling your offerings.</li> 
                    <li>In-person attendees and guests will be required to show proof of vaccination (including booster shots) and wear masks. The hotel may have less stringent requirements in common areas. Therefore, we will enforce our requirements in Paizo-controlled spaces such as the ballrooms, seminar rooms, gaming rooms, and the Paizo store. Failure to comply may result in your expulsion and a potential ban from future major conventions.</li> 
                    <li>Any questions about the GM signup process should be sent to the committee at paizoorgplayhq@gmail.com. </li> 
                   </ul>

                   <p>For purchasers of PaizoCon 2020 tickets who rolled them over to our next physical show, we will be updating your tickets to ones for PaizoCon 2022. Anyone who wishes for a refund can do so by contacting customer.service@paizo.com. Please use the subject line “PaizoCon 2020 Refund” to expedite your request. The deadline for refund requests will be March 11, 2022, after which we will open up PaizoCon 2022 tickets for general purchase and put PaizoCon Online tickets on sale. </p> 
                   <p>One change from prior in-person PaizoCons is that we are using Warhorn for all our event scheduling. We will have an initial schedule posted by March 21st and will update it as we add more events. If you are an author, third-party publisher, or Pathfinder Infinite content producer interested in running events, please stay tuned to the Paizo blog for more information about how to add your events to our online or physical schedule!</p> 
                   <p>Covid-19 remains an ongoing consideration, and Paizo is committed to the safety of the Paizo staff and attendees. The precautions we are taking include: </p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li>In-person attendees are required to show proof of vaccination (including booster shots) and wear masks in all Paizo-controlled spaces such as ballrooms, seminar rooms, gaming spaces, and the Paizo store.</li> 
                    <li>No banquet event</li> 
                    <li>Hand sanitizer available in public spaces</li> 
                    <li>Reduced number of physical show tickets with a capped attendance of 500. </li> 
                    <li>More space between attendees in the seminar rooms, OP hall (between players and between tables), and in the Paizo store</li> 
                    <li>Paizo will pivot to an online-only event should conditions take a turn for the worse.</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p>Look for more communication over the next few months as we finalize more details, including event registration dates. We look forward to seeing you either in person or online!</p>

                   <p><em>Pathfinder One-Shot: Mark of the Mantis</em> is a short Pathfinder Second Edition adventure, designed to be played in a single session lasting 3 to 4 hours. However, with opportunities for roleplaying and plenty of combat, the adventure could easily make for two exciting evenings of play. <em>Mark of the Manti</em>s includes pregenerated characters (found in a separate downloadable PDF) with interwoven backstories that contextualize their relationships and further enrich the adventure itself. This adventure should be played with all four characters. If only three players are available, the GM should bring in the fourth character as an NPC. This adventure can be easily adjusted to suit any party of four themed around the Red Mantis assassin organization. </p>

                   <p>A Pathfinder Bounty designed for Level 3.<br> When the Fifth Mendevian Crusade ended, the hamlet of Bulviss was one of many casualties on the Mendevian side of the border.

Now, contracted by an interested party, a group of adventurers must head into the ruins of Bulviss to find a missing deed and any other surviving treasures. Have the demons truly been removed, or are there other, darker secrets waiting in the ruins?</p>

Since then, he can be found on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/Stellarencore">@Stellarencore</a>) taking part in several other Starfinder shows, helping set up crossover events and dipping their toe into the world of Pathfinder 2E with the Manapot EU happy hour.

                   <p>“Coming to the hobby only recently, I was kicking myself for not taking up TTRPGs sooner. It's been a great source of new adventures and new friends. If you're even halfway curious but worried about what others may think, or sticking out at the table, I promise you if you find a good group and jump straight in, you won't regret it!” </p>

                   <p>Navaar is the creator and host of the Secret Nerd Podcast, a TTRPG Talk Show that features guests from across the spectrum talking about how they got into TTRPG’s and why the games are for everyone. Creating a show that is very diverse and inclusive is very important to Navaar, because it helps add to the space in a positive way. Along with these episodes, he’s also done two bonus episodes (so far) playing one-shots of Pathfinder 2e with other creators. This has been a great way to introduce new folks to the system, as well as expose listeners to a game he is fond of, with interesting stories. Along with the podcast, Navaar is also an aspiring writer and game designer, so keep an eye out for future projects!</p>

                   <p>Pathfinders! You’re needed! We’ve got another sanctuary to shatter this month, and some ancient ruins that could use a bit more exploring, reporting, and cooperating.</p> 
                   <p>First, to the ruins! <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02apj?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-310-Delve-the-Pallid-Depths"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-10: Delve the Pallid Depths</em></a> takes us back to Darkmoon Vale, where Venture-Captain Luna Aldred needs some Pathfinders to further explore the dwarven ruins buried beneath the volcano known as Droskar’s Crag. She wants the agents to scout the area and find out what happened to a duergar raiding party that seems to have vanished! Sound familiar? Think you’ve seen these ruins before? That’s because this scenario takes us deeper into the site we initially explored in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027ni/discuss?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-219-Enter-the-Pallid-Peak"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #2-19: Enter the Pallid Peak</em></a>! You don’t need to play <em>Enter the Pallid Peak</em> before you enjoy this new adventure, but it may enhance your experience if you do.</p> 
                   <p>I don’t want to spoil anything, but there is a lot going on beneath Droskar’s Crag. <em>Delve the Pallid Depths</em> presents the player characters with an important decision about future expeditions in the ruins, so if you want to weigh in, be sure to play the adventure! <em>Delve the Pallid Depths</em> is a creepy dungeon exploration adventure for levels 1–4, and it’s Caryn DiMarco’s first full-length Pathfinder Society adventure. Enjoy!</p>

                   <p>Next up, we have a Year of Shattered Sanctuaries metaplot scenario. If you’ve been paying attention, you know that this year’s metaplot is broken up into <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shy6">multiple arcs</a>, each focused on a particular nation in the Inner Sea. <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02ar0?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-311-No-Time-for-Treason"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-11: No Time for Treason</em></a> takes us to Oppara, the capital of Taldor! Lady Gloriana Morilla, a long-time ally of the Society, has requested aid in following a series of strange crimes across the city. The crimes target assets and allies of Grand Princess Eutropia, and the perpetrators are using custom <em>wayfinders</em> to aid their foul deeds. The Society’s own venture-captain, the mage-machinist Muesello, is an expert in such customizations, and Gloriana hasn’t been able to track him down. Is he somehow involved in the crimes? She can’t bring herself to believe that her old friend has turned traitor—it’s up to you, Pathfinders, to learn the truth!</p> 
                   <p><em>No Time for Treason</em> is an urban investigation adventure for levels 3–6, written by veteran organized play author Rigby Bendele. Watch your backs!</p> 
                   <p>That’s all for now. It’s a good day to explore, report, and cooperate!</p>

                  <blockquote> 
                   <h2>ON KILLING KIN</h2> 
                   <p itemprop="description">Amiri's arms burned as she hauled herself upward. Her hands cramped from finding tenuous grips on small extrusions of stone, and one particularly vicious bit of rock had sliced open a good gash below her knee out of what she assumed was sheer spite. She unspooled her rope as she went, securing it whenever she found an anchor point she was sure could bear Branum and Oska's weight.</p> 
                   <p>Below her, the siblings moved slowly. They'd lashed themselves together and to the rope, and Oska helped haul her brother upward, pointing out easy hand- and footholds wherever she could. Oska looked up, the light from above casting a narrow band across her face. "Getting tired yet?" she called up. "You're slowing down."</p> 
                   <p>"How about you don't insult the woman with the rope," Amiri replied, scowling down at her.</p> 
                   <p>"How about… we all… just try… not to plunge to our deaths," Branum panted.</p> 
                   <p>"From that height, you probably wouldn't die from the fall. You'd shatter your legs and starve to death," Amiri said.</p> 
                   <p>"You'd die of thirst way before starving to death," Oska countered.</p> 
                   <p>"Is this… supposed to be making me feel better?" Branum asked. He paused, clinging to the rope as he struggled to catch his breath.</p> 
                   <p>"I'm not going to let you fall," Oska said seriously.</p> 
                   <p>"I know. Besides, I could… always give us… a soft landing. I'm not… completely useless," Branum reminded her. He waggled his fingers, and a few anemic sparks of light danced around them.</p> 
                   <p>"Stop showing off and save your strength. Come on. Halfway there," she said, fondness in her voice.</p> 
                   <p>He nodded, steeled himself, and began to climb again. He was an odd one to find among the Six Bears, Amiri thought. He trusted his sister—and more than that, he readily accepted her aid and comfort. Not once had he objected to her taking the lead on physical tasks. It truly didn't seem to bother him that a woman was stronger than he was. That wasn't a trait she'd encountered from her kinsmen often. Or ever.</p> 
                   <p>Amiri pulled herself up to a new handhold, then paused. It wasn't far to the top, now—she was close enough to see beyond the slim opening to a ceiling of stone. The top of the shaft led to another sheltered area, but given the light coming down through it, it wasn't entirely covered.</p> 
                   <p>From above came a series of yips and snarls, then the scrambling of claws. Amiri gestured sharply for the others to halt and be silent as the growling intensified. Something clattered, and then a few bones—gristle still clinging to them—toppled over the side of the shaft. Amiri clung tight to the wall to avoid the debris. Branum stifled a startled sound as a femur smacked his shoulder.</p> 
                   <p><em>Wait</em>, Amiri motioned. The snarling and yipping and scrabbling continued. The cubs were playing.</p> 
                   <p>The sounds went on for several minutes before falling into abrupt silence. Amiri waited another few moments, then began to climb again. They moved without speaking now, slow but steady.</p> 
                   <p>Before long, Amiri was at the top of the shaft. She pushed her head and shoulders out of the opening, scanning for the peryton and its cubs.</p> 
                   <p>The cubs lay curled up together on the far side of a large rock overhang, its floor littered with bones, offal, and half-eaten carcasses. One of the cubs had fallen asleep gnawing on a skull that might have belonged to a halfling; the other had a hand, half stripped of flesh, tucked between its paws. Beyond the overhang was a small plateau with slopes dropping off precipitously to all sides. There was no sign of the larger creature.</p> 
                   <p>Amiri climbed out as silently as she could, then turned to help the others. Oska moved off to the side to push as Amiri pulled, and they got Branum up onto level ground, where he half-crouched and half-collapsed, wheezing as quietly as he could. Oska scrambled up, quick as a squirrel, but her arms were shaking, and she flexed her hands like they were cramped.</p> 
                   <p>Amiri's limbs weren't thanking her, either. "Best go before the mother comes back," she whispered.</p> 
                   <p>Oska nodded and tapped Branum's shoulder. He suppressed a groan as he staggered up to his feet, and they edged along the side of the sheltered area, Oska leading and Amiri taking up the rear to keep an eye on the cubs.</p> 
                   <p>One moment, Oska was stepping out into the open, looking behind her with a frown to track her brother's progress. The next moment she was gone, snatched into the air with a scream.</p> 
                   <p>"Oska!" Branum yelled. Amiri shoved past him. The peryton's wingbeats scattered dust and debris as the creature climbed, the grip of its hind talons piercing the flesh of Oska's shoulders. The girl screamed in pain and twisted—not to get free, but to throw her bow and quiver as hard as she could. They clattered to the ground 20 feet away. Amiri dove for them, snatched them up.</p> 
                   <p>She sighted along the arrow. Waiting. The peryton circled around, moving awkwardly due to Oska's thrashing weight beneath it. </p> 
                   <p>"Damn it, hold still or it'll drop you off the cliff!" Amiri shouted. "Wait!"</p> 
                   <p>The creature banked, passing high overhead. Oska, miraculously, went still in its grip.</p> 
                   <p>"Hope you weren't lying about that soft landing," Amiri said to Branum, not waiting for him to answer. The peryton's shadow darkened the edge of the plateau.</p> 
                   <p>Amiri loosed the arrow. It struck the beast's left hind talon. The creature let out a strangled yelp of pain and lost its grip on the struggling huntress. She plunged downward. Branum reached out a hand and cried out a single word. Oska landed in a light crouch as the peryton tumbled in the air, righted, and wheeled away.</p> 
                   <p>"Can we drive it off?" Branum asked. "Run?"</p> 
                   <p>"We were in its nest. Its cubs are in there. It isn't going to leave us alone now," Amiri said. She tossed the bow and quiver back to Oska, who winced as she worked her punctured shoulders. Amiri unstrapped the unwieldy, broken base of her sword from her back, gripping the hilt in both hands.</p> 
                   <p>The peryton's shadow glided over the plateau once more. Only its shape was wrong.</p> 
                   <p>"It took your shadow," Oska said, seeing the same. She gave Amiri a considering look. "It's coming for you."</p> 
                   <p>"Which means you could run," Amiri replied. "It won't chase you while I'm still standing."</p> 
                   <p>The beast howled. It folded its wings in a dive, eyes fixed on Amiri. Oska and Branum fell back. And Amiri leapt to meet the creature's charge.</p> 
                   <p>They met in the air—blade and beast, fang and fury. The peryton's eyes blazed with the fire of a mother whose cubs had been threatened. Amiri's blood sang with rage of her own. Anger for the beast, yes—but her old anger burned far brighter as she tumbled to the stony ground with the monster.</p> 
                   <p>She chanced a quick glance: the siblings were gone. <em>Good</em>, she thought. They'd be safe. They'd live. Maruk wouldn't have any more reason to haunt her.</p> 
                   <p>Her jagged blade slashed across the beast's chest, and the mountains rang with her brothers' mocking laughter. Teeth snapped in the air an inch from her throat, and the air slithered with whispers. <em>It isn't right. She brings shame to all of us. Something must be done.</em></p> 
                   <p>They had betrayed her. Made a fool of her. Humiliated her and tried to lead her to her death. But they had failed. She had showed them her true strength.</p> 
                   <p>She struck at the peryton again and again in a storm of steel and claw. It darted in for quick attacks, retreating before she could get a proper strike in. Any time she closed, it used a few quick wingbeats to reposition, sending her scrambling around the plateau, wary of the sheer cliffs to every side. The broken blade was unbalanced and unwieldy. Fury collapsed into frustration, and she stood panting, both her and the beast bleeding from a half dozen minor wounds.</p> 
                   <p>She'd put her back to the sheltered overhang, steering clear of the precipitous drop-offs—all too aware of how easy it would be for the peryton to fling her over the edge with a toss of its gore-rimed antlers.</p> 
                   <p>A sharp pain shot through Amiri's calf. She let out a cry of pain, twisting and striking out. The broken blade swung, cleaving in half the peryton cub that had sunk its teeth into her leg. The other sprang up, needle teeth clamping around her wrist, as its mother let out a howl and charged.</p> 
                   <p>Amiri flung the cub away as the larger beast's antlers caught her up and threw her back against the far wall of the cave. Her head hit stone with a crack. Stars burst in her vision, and she collapsed to the ground in a stunned crouch. The peryton paced forward, opening its jaws to bare its yellowed teeth.</p> 
                   <p>There was a crackling sound, and lightning arced, blasting into the peryton's side. Two arrows followed in quick succession, and the peryton screamed, rearing away. Amiri launched herself forward, stars still dancing in her eyes, and dashed past the beast.</p> 
                   <p>Oska and Branum stood at the edge of the plateau. Branum raised his hands, light dancing at his fingertips. Oska set another arrow to her bow. Amiri skidded to a stop in front of them.</p> 
                   <p>"What do you think you're doing?" she demanded. "I told you to run."</p> 
                   <p>"Talked it over. Decided not to listen to you," Branum said cheerfully.</p> 
                   <p>"We don't leave kin to fight alone," Oska said firmly.</p> 
                   <p>Amiri stared. It had been a long time—a very long time—since anyone had claimed her as kin. "I killed your father," she said hollowly. "He was a good man. More or less."</p> 
                   <p>"You killed your kin," Oska agreed. Her eyes were bright. "But you know what, Amiri? I'm better than you."</p> 
                   <p>The peryton staggered into the light. It reared up on its hind legs, bellowing out a call to shake the mountains.</p> 
                   <p>Amiri and her kin turned to face it.</p>

                   <p>Amiri dumped the waterskin over her head, rinsing some of the blood out of her hair. The sun was going down. The cold air would keep the peryton's corpse, laid out on the plateau behind her, from rotting. But there were other scavengers in these mountains, and they'd be along soon to take their portion of the kill.</p> 
                   <p>Oska had already carved the antlers from its head and bound them together to carry over her shoulder, as a trophy.</p> 
                   <p>"You know you won't be able to claim that as your kill," Amiri said. She flicked her wet hair back from her face.</p> 
                   <p>Oska didn't meet her eyes. "I'll say Branum killed it."</p> 
                   <p>Branum laughed aloud. "Yeah, they'll certainly believe that."</p> 
                   <p>"We'll figure it out," Oska said, securing her makeshift straps.</p> 
                   <p>Amiri just shook her head. She'd never have let someone else claim one of her deeds at that age. She'd have shouted it to the whole clan at every opportunity.</p> 
                   <p><em>And look how that turned out</em>, she thought. She spat.</p> 
                   <p>"Can I have that?" Branum asked. Amiri gave him a questioning look. He gestured at the two halves of her blade that rested on the ground beside her.</p> 
                   <p>"You couldn't even lift the thing," she told him, amused.</p> 
                   <p>"I mean I can fix it for you," Branum said.</p> 
                   <p>Oska straightened up. A frown creased her lips. "That's the sword that—"</p> 
                   <p>"It's a sword," Branum said. "Just a tool. What matters is who wields it, not what it's done."</p> 
                   <p>Amiri gave him a level look. "The woman who wields this sword is the one that killed your father," she reminded him. "You really want to give me my blade back?"</p> 
                   <p>Branum looked over at the dead peryton. "Honestly? I want you to die a slow and painful death," he said, his cheerful tone unwavering. "But that wouldn't do anybody any good, would it? You took my father from me. I've got no interest in forgiving you. And I've got no interest in being a kinslayer. So now I get to choose how I carry that—how I bear my choices without breaking. This is how I'm going to do it."</p> 
                   <p>He stepped forward and reached for the sword. Neither Amiri nor Oska said anything to stop him as he dragged the pieces over to a clear patch of ground. He stood with an expression of deep concentration, his hands held over the blade.</p> 
                   <p>Slowly, the segments shivered toward one another. The metal gleamed. The seam lit with a soft, silver light—and then the light faded, and the blade was whole once more.</p> 
                   <p>Branum stepped away, not touching it again. He bent to pick up his pack and settled it on his shoulder. "That's done, then," he said simply.</p> 
                   <p>Amiri hefted the blade. The familiar pull at her muscles was welcome. The guilt needling through her was not.</p> 
                   <p>"Let's go," Oska said, touching her brother's arm. They turned away.</p> 
                   <p>"Don't go back," Amiri said, staring at the sword. Behind her, their footsteps halted.</p> 
                   <p>"What else are we supposed to do?" Oska asked.</p> 
                   <p>"Just leave." Amiri lowered the sword and turned toward them. "Leave before they find a way to kill you, or kill everything you are."</p> 
                   <p>"It's not that easy," Oska said.</p> 
                   <p>Amiri's lips twisted. "If it was, maybe I could've done it, before it was too late. But you're smarter than I ever was. Or your brother is, at least."</p> 
                   <p>Oska and Branum glanced at each other. "We don't hate the Six Bears," Branum said.</p> 
                   <p>"Neither did I. I loved my brothers," Amiri said. "Didn't stop them trying to kill me. Didn't stop me killing them."</p> 
                   <p>"Where are we supposed to go, then? With you?" Oska asked scornfully.</p> 
                   <p>Amiri snorted. "None of us would survive that," she said, and Oska chuckled in reluctant agreement. "The world's bigger than you think. Go see what it holds. Leave—while you still have the option of coming home, if you decide that's what you want."</p> 
                   <p>Oska didn't answer. Neither did Branum. They turned away, setting out without another word. But Branum looked at Oska, and Oska looked at Branum, and Amiri could tell that each was thinking of the other. Of the things they could achieve, if they found the place where they belonged. </p> 
                   <p>They'd leave, she thought. Not for themselves, but each for the other. Maybe someday they would even return—as she never could.</p> 
                   <p>Amiri made her way down the opposite flank of the mountain, away from the siblings. Away from the Six Bears.</p> 
                   <p>The wind howled between the peaks. She listened long and hard, but there were no words within. It was only the wind.</p>

                   <p>Paizo will be attending the Gen Con 2022 game convention from August 4–7 in Indianapolis. You’ll see the Paizo booth in the exhibit hall and the return of Organized Play to the Sagamore Ballroom. Organized Play will have a slightly smaller number of tables than in prior years, so we encourage you to sign up for events early to claim your spot.</p> 
                   <p>For those unable to make the trek to Gen Con, Paizo will also host a suite of online events and seminars. This year’s Pathfinder interactive special will premiere simultaneously at the physical event and Gen Con Online. </p> 
                   <p>We’ll release additional details in the coming months. Stay tuned!</p>

                  <blockquote> 
                   <h2>THE SPLINTERING OF BONE</h2> 
                   <p itemprop="description">Branum and Oska muttered to each other as Amiri prepared. She did her best to ignore them. She couldn't understand them, anyway—they were talking in an odd, garbled tongue, and suddenly she remembered that, too. The twins with their private language, infuriating Maruk because he thought his children were making fun of him. He'd always been going on about how his son was going to be as mighty a warrior as Maruk himself.</p> 
                   <p>She glanced sidelong at Branum. He was shivering in the cool air of the cave, and his sister tossed her own cloak over his shoulders without comment. So much for Maruk's ambitions. He hadn't lived long enough to be disappointed in the boy.</p> 
                   <p>Amiri turned on her heel, leaving the thought behind, and made her way to the back of the cave. A squeeze indeed. She <em>hmmed</em>, hand against the rock.</p> 
                   <p>"Something wrong?" Branum asked.</p> 
                   <p>"Just wondering how many ways to die there are, shoving yourself into a crack like that," Amiri mused.</p> 
                   <p>"I could list them, if it helps," Branum said.</p> 
                   <p>She gave him a flat look. "It really doesn't," she said. She turned sideways and slid into the gap.</p> 
                   <p>Amiri wasn't afraid of tight spaces, as a rule, but a space this tight, it worked its way into the back of your brain, where all the deepest, most primal instincts hung around to tell you what was going to kill you. This was a killing space. A grasping, crushing, suffocating space. There wasn't even room to set her feet flat on the floor—she had to brace her legs at odd angles, push her way through with her calves and shoulders and by pulling with the tips of one outstretched hand. Behind her, Branum was praying. Behind him, Oska muttered to him or to herself, Amiri couldn't tell. She couldn't turn her head to look. It was like having ghosts at her back, whispering unseen.</p> 
                   <p>Then, suddenly, she was free. The walls of the squeeze released her, and she stepped easily out into a wider tunnel. She worked her limbs, flexing to bring some feeling back into them.</p> 
                   <p>"Made it through," she called back. Branum thanked a half-dozen gods and other entities, and the sounds of scraping and huffing intensified as the twins hurried to join her. From there, the trek was easier, though hardly swift going. Without the sun to track time, it was hard to tell how long they traveled, clambering over shelves of rock and backtracking when they hit dead ends. They hadn't found an exit yet, but they hadn't run out of cave, either.</p> 
                   <p>"I can smell fresh air," Branum said at last, sniffing theatrically.</p> 
                   <p>Amiri stood next to him and tested the air. "This way," she said, setting off down a side tunnel. She only made it a few steps before the tunnel abruptly ended in a small, round chamber.</p> 
                   <p>The floor was scattered with bones.</p> 
                   <p>She reached for her dagger, cautioning the others back. The bones looked animal—mostly. Half a deer lay in the middle of the floor, blood dried black but flesh not yet rotted away. Its blood had spattered half the chamber.</p> 
                   <p>But it wasn’t the deer that held her gaze. Amiri’s eyes were fixed on a human skeleton sprawled across an outcrop of rock toward the back of the room. Bits of desiccated flesh and moldering clothes clung to the bones. A few scraps of leather armor still adorned its hips and chest, stamped with a pattern of paw prints and swirling lines, almost impossible to make out after so many years. But Amiri remembered them perfectly.</p> 
                   <p>"Who do you think they were?" Branum asked, moving cautiously into the chamber. "What were they doing down here?"</p> 
                   <p>"Does it matter?" Oska asked. "Something's been eating things in here. We shouldn't stick around."</p> 
                   <p>Amiri tightened her jaw. "It matters," she said. "That's Erskar. He was wearing that armor the day I killed him."</p> 
                   <p>Oska hissed between her teeth. Branum looked alarmed, straightening up. "I knew he was with Father that day, but his body wasn't found. Some people thought you'd run off together."</p> 
                   <p>Amiri snorted. "With Erskar? Not on your life."</p> 
                   <p>"So he survived? Snuck off on his own for some reason?" Branum mused.</p> 
                   <p>"None of those men would have abandoned their clan," Oska spat.</p> 
                   <p>"Certainly not without most of his guts. Erskar was dead. They were all dead," Amiri said, and as always, the image was as fresh and real in her mind as the day it happened. <em>They brought it on themselves</em>, she thought. They'd meant her to die. They'd weaseled their way out of calling it murder, but they'd brought her there to meet her end.</p> 
                   <p>"Then how is he <em>here</em>?" Branum asked. Then, "Oh!" He pointed to Erskar's chest, and Amiri saw at once what he'd spotted. She'd left Erskar gutted on the ground. But the skeleton's legs were splintered, one arm broken clean through. And his ribs had been shattered, pried apart.</p>

                   <p>Perytons preferred live prey, but in lean times they scavenged, just like everything else. So the peryton—or its parent, maybe—had taken the corpse for a snack, flying up into the peaks with it. It had eaten its favorite part of the body, and apparently not gotten around to the rest. But no peryton would roost in these caves, even if it could fit.</p> 
                   <p>"No tunnels <em>out</em>. But what about <em>up</em>?” Amiri mused.</p> 
                   <p>Branum nodded and lifted his crystal, peering up toward the ceiling. And there it was. A chimney leading up out of the tunnel. Wider than the squeeze, at least. Wide enough for the corpse of a large man to tumble through and be forgotten, rotting away year after year.</p> 
                   <p>“That’s our way out,” Amiri said.</p> 
                   <p>“Looks like it,” Branum concurred.</p> 
                   <p>“You know, if the peryton’s meals are falling down here this frequently…” Oska began.</p> 
                   <p>Amiri nodded. “It’s eating up there. Which means that’s probably its nest.”</p> 
                   <p>“Oh. Lovely,” Branum said.</p> 
                   <p>“It’s our only option,” Amiri said. “So we’d better get climbing.” She’d take fighting the peryton over sticking around here with these cubs, that was certain.</p> 
                   <p>“Not yet,” Oska said.</p> 
                   <p>“You getting fond of the place?” Amiri asked her, but Oska glanced sidelong at Branum—who was trying to hide the fact that he was limping and out of breath, and pale as the belly of a fish.</p> 
                   <p>“We should rest a while,” Oska said.</p> 
                   <p>“I won’t make it up with or without rest,” Branum said, grimacing. “If you can get up and secure a rope or something…”</p> 
                   <p>“We all go up,” Amiri said. She wasn’t going to leave the boy behind. And she certainly wasn’t going anywhere alone with his sister. Keeping Branum around was the only way to be sure one of them wasn’t going to end up dead.</p> 
                   <p>“We’ve got rope. We can secure it as we go, help you up,” Oska said. “But I’d rather do that with some rest and some food in my belly.”</p> 
                   <p>Amiri’s stomach rumbled on cue. “I hope you brought something to eat, because that deer’s long past being appetizing,” she said.</p> 
                   <p>Oska gave a curt nod, and against their united front, Branum gave in. Oska set down her pack and pulled out salted fish, mashed and dried berries formed into a leather, and a handful of nuts. She broke the fish into three shares. Amiri expected to be handed a smaller one, but Oska had portioned them evenly. Even if she did drop it into Amiri’s hand like she was afraid of touching her.</p> 
                   <p>“That’s all you brought?” Amiri asked.</p> 
                   <p>Oska shrugged as she handed her brother his share. “It’s all we had. Like I said, game has been scarce.”</p> 
                   <p>“You’re young yet. The clan shouldn’t be letting you go hungry,” Amiri said, troubled. “Not Maruk’s kids.”</p> 
                   <p>She’d spent her years of exile thinking often enough of that last day—and less often of the day before. It was painful, remembering the way her clan had jeered and mocked her behind her back, had discussed her death with gleeful anticipation. But that pain was twinned with anger, and anger was an ally.</p> 
                   <p>It was the earlier memories that were harder. Remembering not how Maruk had laughed at her, but the times they’d laughed together. Remembering not the way he’d died, cleaved limb from limb in the face of her rage, but the times they’d raced and wrestled and bickered. She’d made Maruk laugh a lot, she remembered. His wife had always thought her a bad influence. She’d thought he was one of the few that truly didn’t see her as a woman who ought to know her place, but as a warrior who’d earned it.</p> 
                   <p>“It was like that a while,” Branum said. He sat with his legs splayed before him, picking at his food. “We had everything we could ask for. Everyone was always telling me how I was going to carry on Father’s legacy. Be a great warrior, like he was. And then I wasn’t, and they lost interest.”</p> 
                   <p>“Someone had to provide for us,” Oska said. She hunched over her food, not meeting Amiri’s eyes. “But that only made it worse. Turned near everyone against us.”</p> 
                   <p>“For feeding yourselves? I know it’s not common for a woman, but—"</p> 
                   <p>Oska looked up, eyes alight with hatred. “It’s not just <em>not common</em> anymore. Not for the Six Bears. After what you did? ‘Look what happens when you let a woman think she’s a warrior,’ they said.”</p> 
                   <p>“You think I didn’t hear that, too? ‘Watch out, or you’ll end up like Amiri,’ they’d tell the other girls. I never let it stop me,” Amiri said. She’d always taken it as a point of pride. <em>Like Amiri</em> meant strong, capable, unstoppable. She didn't want the things it denied her—the husband, the children, the days spent tending the fire and tanning another hunter's hides.</p> 
                   <p>"And look what happened," Oska said dully. "You think that any girl in the Six Bears is allowed to even <em>look</em> at a sword, after you proved what a curse it is, to let a woman fight? I can't even feed myself and my brother without skulking around in secret. Maybe you should have let it stop you. Slow you down. Maybe the next girl would've had an easier time of it."</p> 
                   <p>Amiri grunted. "I won't make myself less than I am. Not for anyone. Being what the clan wanted me to be would have killed me."</p> 
                   <p>"Then leave," Branum whispered. They looked at him, surprised. He hadn't spoken this whole time, just stared off into the distance, but now his gaze was intense. "You could have just left."</p> 
                   <p>"My <em>kin</em>, your <em>father</em>, arranged to have me killed," Amiri growled.</p> 
                   <p>"They never did anything to you. Just let you do it to yourself," Branum said.</p> 
                   <p>Amiri shook her head. "They wanted me dead. They betrayed me. And I—"</p> 
                   <p>"Could have left," Branum repeated. "You weren't in danger. They were no threat to you. You could have walked away and lived a life to prove them wrong."</p> 
                   <p>He was wrong. Someone else could have walked away, but Amiri couldn't. She was going to die that day, or they were. There was never going to be another path.</p> 
                   <p>"We should go," Oska said roughly. She brushed crumbs from her fingers and stood. She put out her hand to help her brother up.</p> 
                   <p>Amiri didn't know how she could explain what had happened in a way that the two would understand. It wasn't that Branum was wrong. She hadn't been defending herself. And it had been her own foolish pride and boastfulness that had made any of it possible. </p> 
                   <p>For her kin to betray her. Humiliate her. Take her home from her—for how could she return, no matter the outcome, once she knew what they had intended? They wanted her dead or broken.</p> 
                   <p>And she couldn't walk away. <em>She</em> couldn't. Someone else might have. Would have. There was nothing to stop her except herself. Her rage. Her grief at everything that had been torn so brutally from her in those horrible moments.</p> 
                   <p>She should have walked away. But Amiri of the Six Bears couldn't.</p> 
                   <p>Maybe she could, now. But Amiri of no clan was not the woman who had been lured into those mountains. She was not the woman who had left. And she could not go back to that moment, and stand in the place Amiri of the Six Bears stood, and make her choices for her.</p> 
                   <p>She could only move on.</p> 
                   <p>Only move up.</p> 
                   <p>She could only keep climbing.</p>

                   <h2>Digital Adventure Releases</h2> 
                   <p>Here are this month’s digital releases, available February 23, 2022:</p> 
                   <h3>Pathfinder</h3> 
                   <p><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02apj?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-310-Delve-the-Pallid-Depths"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-10: Delve the Pallid Depths</em></a>*<br> <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02ar0?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-311-No-Time-for-Treason"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-11: No Time for Treason</em></a>*<br> <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02arg?Pathfinder-Bounty-18-From-Family-Lost"><em>Pathfinder Bounty #18: From Family Lost</em></a><br> <em>Pathfinder One-Shot #4: Mark of the Mantis</em></p> 
                   <h3>Starfinder</h3> 
                   <p><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02ar1?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-414-Rasheens-Remembrance"><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #4-14: Rasheen's Remembrance</em></a>*</p> 
                   <p><em>*part of a subscription</em></p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h2>Pathfinder Society-Specific Rule Updates</h2> 
                   <p>This month, we published several rule clarifications &amp; updates that apply specifically to the Pathfinder Society campaign. These clarifications are always available on the <a href="https://paizo.com/organizedplay/faq">Organized Play FAQ pages</a> or in the appropriate <a href="https://organizedplayfoundation.org/Lorespire/Homepage"><em>Guide to Organized Play</em></a>, but we wanted to make sure we highlighted them here.</p> 
                   <h3>Massive Damage</h3> 
                   <p>When considering if a character would be killed outright by Massive Damage, you should treat their maximum Hit Points as 20 if they have fewer than 20 maximum Hit Points. This clarification is to attempt to avoid killing first-level characters outright. If a new player is about to do something reckless that will almost certainly result in their death (such as their character leaping off a cliff), ensure that they understand the potential consequences first.</p> 
                   <h3>Similar Lore</h3> 
                   <p>If a scenario calls for a specific Lore and a player has an extremely similar Lore (such as Pathfinder Lore in place of Pathfinder Society Lore), the GM should permit the use of that Lore. If a Lore is adjacent (e.g. Academia Lore in place of Library Lore), the GM can permit its use if they feel the two overlap enough. Ultimately, the GM is empowered to use their best judgment in such situations. This guidance has been floating around for a while, so we wanted to codify it in the FAQ page.</p> 
                   <h3>Additional Languages</h3> 
                   <p>The Character Creation section of the <em>Guide to Organized Play</em> has been updated to grant all Pathfinder Society characters an additional regional language at character creation. It’s important to us that the characters in the campaign represent the diversity of the world of Golarion, and this small change ensures that characters from a region outside the Inner Sea can more accurately represent their home and know their home region’s language. Most characters will gain an additional language as a result of this update.</p> 
                   <h3>Bequeathal Boons</h3> 
                   <p>The section of the Bequeathal boons that required a character receiving access to wait until their level matched the level of the originating chronicle sheet has been removed. This created unintentional tangles with sanctioned material that could be applied to a character of any level and was unnecessary with the way the game system gives most options a level anyway. The boons have been updated in the Achievement Points store; any previously-downloaded versions can be downloaded again to update the language, but doing so is not required.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h2>Starfinder Errata</h2> 
                   <p>Last week, the Starfinder team <a href="https://paizo.com/starfinder/faq">released some errata</a>, including updates for the newly-released <em>Galactic Magic</em>. In particular, this errata changed the text of the Genetics Field of Study for biohackers.</p> 
                   <p>Any character who finds that this change materially affects their character is free to choose a different field of study for their biohacker with no required time or credit investment. We are updating the language around similar rules updates in the <em>Guide to Organized Play</em> to ensure that future changes of the same type will be handled similarly.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h2>Sanctioning</h2> 
                   <p>This month was a busy month for sanctioning! We released sanctioning for <em>Starfinder Galactic Magic</em> on release date, and then updated it a few hours later to allow another option through (you’re welcome, vanguard fans)! We also updated the sanctioning for the <em>Character Operations Manual</em> to finally permit Qi Adept through for soldiers. For Pathfinder Society (First Edition), the Return of the Runelords Adventure Path is sanctioned for play and available for reporting.</p> 
                   <p>February is a fairly quiet month on the product release front, so it’s possible that there won’t be any new content next time I talk to you. I’m working with our art team to get the final updates of the older sanctioned content completed so as to ensure that all sanctioned material is consistent and awards the correct rewards. Generally speaking, the next material to be newly sanctioned will be Book of the Dead and the Quest for the Frozen Flame Adventure Path for Pathfinder Society (Second Edition); the Horizons of the Vast Adventure Path for Starfinder Society; and the Tyrant’s Grasp Adventure Path for Pathfinder Society (First Edition), which should close the book on new material for that campaign.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h2>GM Recognition</h2> 
                   <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the 5th milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios, as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains (program dependent). A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th milestone is 650 hours! </p>
                   <p>This month, we completed a hat trick for the first time, with one new 5-rank GM in each program!</p> 
                   <p><b>5th Star (PFS1)</b>: Wally Waltner<br> <b>5th Nova (SFS)</b>: Landon Hatfield<br> <b>5th Glyph (PFS2)</b>: Jimmy Dick</p> 
                   <p>Congratulations to our new 5-rank GMs, and thank you for your dedication! If you believe you have achieved your 5th rank but haven’t been announced, email us at organizedplay@paizo.com.</p> 
                   <p>That’s quite enough from me, so I’ll sign off now. Until next time—Explore! Report! Cooperate! And stay tuned for news about SFS Year 5, coming soon!</p>

                   <h2>STRAY CUBS</h2> 
                   <p itemprop="description"></p>
                   <p>Sometimes, when Amiri was bored, she considered all the ways she could have died over the years. Not that she had any desire to analyze them strategically, as one companion had suggested. Nor to contemplate the inevitability of death and its philosophical implications, as another had asked.</p> 
                   <p>Mostly, she found it oddly soothing to know that death lurked so near, waiting for a step to the right instead of left, an undercooked bit of meat, a tent pitched under the wrong overhang. Death could come because of a mistake, a miscalculation, a failure—but it could come as easily from fortune's slightest whim.</p> 
                   <p>She couldn't decide which sort of death this one was—error or chance. She debated it groggily in her mind for a few seconds before realizing that the fact that she was thinking about it at all probably meant she wasn’t actually dead.</p> 
                   <p>The cold and all-too-familiar kiss of a blade at her throat, though, suggested that such luck might not last long.</p> 
                   <p>She blinked grit from her eyes, but it didn't help much with the view. She lay on her side, her lower body half-buried under rocks and dirt, facing a rough stone wall a foot from her nose. One arm was pinned awkwardly under her. A hand held her by the hair, and another held a knife to her neck. </p> 
                   <p>"Oska, what do you think you're doing?" a low voice asked. The boy.</p> 
                   <p>"Don't you know who this is?" his sister replied.</p> 
                   <p>"You're not going to slit the throat of an unconscious woman," he said, sounding much surer about it than Amiri was.</p> 
                   <p>"I'm not unconscious, if it helps," Amiri grated out. The girl let out a startled oath, scrambling back. Amiri's mouth felt like it had been packed solid with dust. She coughed and tasted blood—hopefully from biting her tongue, not anything internal and annoyingly dire.</p> 
                   <p>Amiri twisted onto her back, bringing herself around as best she could. Her legs remained trapped in place, but at least now she could look over at the two young hunters. The girl clutched a dagger like a claw, teeth bared and eyes wild. The boy hovered nearby, expression nervous. It was thanks to him she could see anything at all—the weak, steady light filling the cavern emanated from a small crystal held in his hand.</p> 
                   <p>Up close, she guessed the two of them were maybe 15 or 16, but theirs was the battered kind of youth that came of dangerous places like this. The girl might have been pretty in a dull kind of way, but the scars on her cheek and arms rescued her, made her interesting. The boy had a lean, half-starved look, with hollow eyes and a frail energy around him.</p> 
                   <p> “Well?” Amiri said, breaking the silence. “If you’re going to kill me, now’s the time. It’d spare us all the trouble of digging me out, at least.”</p> 
                   <p> “I have to say, I’ve been called lazy more times than I can count, but I've never murdered anyone to avoid work," the boy said with nervous humor. "Oska. Come on, drop the knife."</p> 
                   <p>The girl—Oska—stared at Amiri, unmoving. Her chest heaved with labored breaths. Amiri flexed her legs, shifting them a fraction, trying to loosen the earth that held her lower body trapped. </p> 
                   <p>"You're Amiri," Oska said through gritted teeth. "Of the Six Bears."</p> 
                   <p>"I am Amiri," she replied, low and steady. “I have no clan.”</p> 
                   <p>A brother and sister with red-gold hair. That dimple in the girl's chin that made her border on adorable, and that she probably hated. Didn't Amiri remember a pair like that? A girl who crouched and watched Amiri train, a boy always huddled close to the fire or in his sister's shadow? </p> 
                   <p>"Oska," she said, repeating the name, trying to place it. Her eyes flicked to the boy. "And you're Branum, is that right?"</p> 
                   <p>He gave a quick, convulsive nod. Oska and Branum. Their mother was Kina, with the copper hair and sweet voice, dead years before Amiri left. And their father—their father was Maruk. Champion wrestler, champion drinker. He was dead, too.</p> 
                   <p>He died the day Amiri left.</p> 
                   <p>She glanced around, casual as she could, searching for her sword. She spotted it, half-wrapped in Branum’s cloak, well out of reach.</p> 
                   <p> “You killed our father,” Oska said, all bile and hatred. Ready to strike.</p>

                   <br> 
                   <p>Amiri had never denied the things she’d done. Not to herself or anyone else. “That’s right,” she said, voice steady. Oska let out a strangled sound of fury and grief and surged forward a step—just one.</p> 
                   <p>Even pinned, Amiri knew she wouldn’t lose that fight. But it wasn’t one she much liked the thought of winning, either.</p> 
                   <p>She pushed herself up on one elbow, glaring at Oska. “I killed your father,” she said. “But whatever I’ve done, girl, your father was my grandmother’s favorite nephew. We’re cousins, you and I. Kin. And that’d make you a kinslayer, just like me."</p> 
                   <p>"Can the kinslayer's kin kill the kinslayer? Or will the kinslayer kill the kinslayer's slain kin's kin?" Branum rattled off. Amiri stared at him. He offered a crooked smile, spread his hands. "Sorry. I can't help it."</p> 
                   <p>Oska snorted. She held still, every muscle tense, for several long seconds. Then, at last, she lowered her dagger. "I'm no kinslayer," she declared, backing away. Amiri let out a breath through her teeth as the tension left her.</p> 
                   <p>Amiri levered herself up higher, still trying to work her legs. The rocks blocking the entrance shifted at her movement, and she froze. There was enough stone blocking the entrance that bringing it down on herself would be very stupid indeed.</p> 
                   <p>"I think we can get you out clean if we move a couple of these rocks and pull you straight out," Branum said, as if following her train of thought.</p> 
                   <p>Oska looked at him askance. "What are you talking about? I'm not helping her."</p> 
                   <p>Branum shrugged. "If you aren't going to kill her, seems like helping her is the other option."</p> 
                   <p>"We could just leave her here."</p> 
                   <p>"She's in the way of the exit," Branum replied. "And I'm not sure we can dig our way out without squishing her, which we've just agreed not to do."</p> 
                   <p>"I wouldn't be killing her, the rocks would be killing her," Oska said sweetly. Amiri glared at her. She glared back.</p> 
                   <p>Had Amiri been this infuriating at this age? Surely not. It had taken at least a little while longer before her clan tried to arrange her death, and surely if she was <em>this</em> annoying they wouldn't have waited.</p> 
                   <p>Oska sighed, surrendering. "Fine. We'll move her out of the way first. Which rocks?"</p> 
                   <p>Branum pointed confidently, and Oska moved without questioning him. Amiri helped as best she could from her awkward angle, obeying Branum's strict instructions not to move her legs at all, lest she disrupt the pile and bring it down on all of them. Well, both of them, since Branum was staying well back for a "better vantage point."</p> 
                   <p>Bit by bit, they eased her out, until finally she was able to clamber to her feet. Her legs were all pins and needles, her feet half-numb, but there was little pain. Nothing broken or too badly bruised, she thought. She'd been lucky. For certain definitions of the word.</p> 
                   <p>"Now, let's get this cleared and get out of here," Oska said.</p> 
                   <p>Branum put a palm to the rocks. Frowned. Got that distant look in his eye of people seeing something they had no natural business seeing. Then he shook his head. "No good. There's a solid few feet of stone in the way. Too much for even you ladies to budge."</p> 
                   <p>"What's the alternative? Die gasping down here?" Oska asked.</p> 
                   <p>Amiri stared at the two of them. Youths of the Six Bears clan. <em>Two stray cubs</em>. So this was what the witch had wanted her to find, then. Maruk's children—who didn't have any better sense than he once had, if they were hunting that peryton on their own. Then again, if Maruk had hared off on a hunt like this, she would have been right on his heels. Or sprinting past him, never mind the risk.</p> 
                   <p>"What were you thinking?" she said, and realized as the words left her mouth that she wasn't sure who she was talking to. These cubs? Maruk's ghost? Or maybe she meant herself.</p> 
                   <p>Oska turned on her. "That beast has been driving out anything bigger than a rabbit, and its fledglings eat all the rabbits. As long as it's here, hunting is scarce."v </p>
                   <p>"So go hunt the lowlands," Amiri said dismissively.</p> 
                   <p>Oska's jaw flared. Branum shifted uncomfortably.</p> 
                   <p>"She's not—" Branum started.</p> 
                   <p>"Branum—" Oska warned.</p> 
                   <p>"—supposed to be hunting," he finished. His sister looked ready to throw him in a lake. He was lucky there weren't any nearby. Branum sighed. "We're on our own these days, and the only thing I know how to catch is a cold. But Oska's not meant to be hunting, so we have to go where the others won't see us. With everyone in the lowlands it's harder."</p> 
                   <p>"Why aren't you allowed to hunt?" Amiri asked, baffled.</p> 
                   <p>"You might have noticed we share a gender," Oska said, one hand planted on her hip.</p> 
                   <p>Amiri shrugged. "Never stopped me. Never stopped anyone I knew from taking a hare or a doe when they needed meat."</p> 
                   <p>"Things are different now," Oska said.</p> 
                   <p>Amiri's brow furrowed, but before she could ask what Oska meant, she felt something—the whisper of a breeze against the back of her neck. "There's fresh air coming from somewhere," she said, stalking toward the back of the cave. There, a narrow crack ran from floor to ceiling. Amiri waved Branum closer and borrowed his light, but the retreating shadows only revealed more stone. The passageway turned. No way to say how far it went or how narrow it got.</p> 
                   <p>"That's quite a squeeze," Branum said.</p> 
                   <p>"Shouldn't bother you, though," Amiri noted.</p> 
                   <p>"Benefits of being a twig," he agreed, shrugging.</p> 
                   <p>"It's not like we have another option. We'll have to see where it goes," Oska said. "But the kinslayer goes in front."</p> 
                   <p>"Think I'm going to stab you in the back, do you?" Amiri asked, chuckling darkly. "Trust me, if I kill you, you'll know it's coming."</p> 
                   <p>"Is it supposed to be a comfort to imagine that my father knew he was betrayed, the moment before you murdered him?" Oska snapped.</p> 
                   <p>Amiri's anger was a lash of fire through her veins. "<em>They</em> were the traitors," she snarled.</p> 
                   <p>Oska's hand wrapped around her dagger's hilt. Her lips skinned back from her teeth. "Liar. Killer. You—"</p> 
                   <p>Branum stepped between them. He put a hand to Oska's shoulder and lifted the other toward Amiri—holding it close to his body, as though he thought she might bite him if he brought it any closer.</p> 
                   <p>"Close quarters make for quick tempers," he said. "We can fight under clear skies. For now, keep focused."</p> 
                   <p>"I've got no quarrel with that," Amiri said. "If your sister keeps her blade pointed elsewhere."</p> 
                   <p>Oska spat at her and wheeled around. She stalked as far away as she could get, which was all of a spear's length, and made a show of checking her gear. Amiri shook her head. "All right. Let me get my sword, and let's get this over with."</p> 
                   <p>"About that," Branum said, and Amiri's heart sank. He bent, lifting aside the fold of his cloak, which had concealed the blade of the massive bastard sword—and hidden where it had broken, snapped to a jagged end halfway down its length.</p> 
                   <p>"What did you do?" Amiri demanded, crossing the distance in two steps and shoving Branum aside.</p> 
                   <p>"We didn't do anything. It broke in the rockslide," Branum said. "Saved your life, though. You were shielding your head with it, didn't get caught by that one." He pointed to a large boulder, wedged inside the entrance. It had taken out a solid chunk of the cave wall on its way in.</p> 
                   <p>"It's just a sword," Oska said.</p> 
                   <p>"Why is it that people think that word has so much power?" Amiri asked.</p> 
                   <p>"What word?" Oska asked, puzzled.</p> 
                   <p>"'Just.' It's just a cut. Just a prank. Just an arrow in your belly. Just a dragon. Who needs magic and weapons when you have 'just' to solve all the world's ills?" </p> 
                   <p><em>Just a sword</em>. Except it wasn't. It was everything she'd done to get it, and everything that had happened after. A friend had once pointed out to her it was a bit literal, carrying the weight of her sins on her back. She'd shoved him into a bog for it. It wasn't about the weight. It was about the purpose. Each time she used this blade, it was one more thing she'd done with it that wasn't the <em>first</em> thing.</p> 
                   <p>Her deeds were not a drop of blood in water, to dissolve and vanish. It wasn't about making the past disappear. It was about being <em>more</em> than that one moment.</p> 
                   <p>That's what she told herself, at least.</p> 
                   <p>She wrapped the blade carefully in Branum's cloak, minding its edges, and bound it with twine. Her pack had been lost somewhere in the rockfall, but she made a bundle she could carry one-handed.</p> 
                   <p>She'd get out. Find someone to mend it.</p> 
                   <p>Keep adding to its list of deeds.</p>

                   <h3>James Case</h3> 
                   <p>My howmi (I couldn’t properly pronounce halmeoni when I was a toddler, abbreviations were made) is a great cook, but growing up, she made Korean food very rarely (Too much chopping! Just chop chop chop! Howmi don’t wanna chop so much!). New years was always the big exception, where she’d make enough food to feed everyone for... honestly, several days. We always had to have our tteokguk first to make sure we’d have good luck for the next year, and it was always the right way to start things off. Happy new year!</p> 
                   <h4>Tteokguk of Time Advancement — Item 5</h4> 
                   <p><b>Consumable, Magical, Transmutation, Polymorph</b><br> <b>Usage</b> Held in 1 hand; <b>Bulk</b> L</p> 
                   <p>Dumplings and rice cakes float invitingly between seaweed and egg in this comforting soup. While normal tteokguk helps you gain an extra year of age when you eat it, the magic in tteokguk of time advancement takes this a step further.</p> 
                   <p><b>Activate</b> [one-action] Interact; <b>Effect</b> Upon eating the tteokguk, you gain several years of age, morphing into an older version of yourself. Your physical appearance and personality change to those you would have at any age older than your current one. This grants you a +4 status bonus to Deception checks to pass as the chosen age, and you can add your level as a proficiency bonus to these checks even if you're untrained. Furthermore, unless a creature specifically uses a Seek action or otherwise carefully examines you, it doesn't get a chance to notice that you aren't at your true age. This lasts until morning of the next day, at which point you are temporarily immune until the next lunar new year.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Eleanor Ferron</h3> 
                   <p>Every new year, my dad's side of the family would gather at my grandma and grandpa's house for a large family reunion. There weren't enough rooms or beds for all the cousins, us kids would fight with one another, and of course after a few days we were all sick of being there. But they're some of my fondest memories. On New Year's Day we would make sushi and lotus root, serve kuromame and the horrible lucky fish cake (which I would begrudgingly choke down a single slice of), but my favorite was my grandpa's inarizushi—tangy sushi rice inside sweet fried tofu pockets. I struggled for ages to be able to split open the delicate fried tofu without ripping the pockets open, and was so proud of myself when I got good at it. In Japan, they are said to be favored by the rice goddess Inari and her fox servants. I didn't know anything about the myths associated with them until later; my brother must have told me when he got interested in studying Japanese culture. Grandpa probably would have gotten grumpy if we'd brought it up, but he might not have minded giving one to a hungry fox. He loved nature and animals, and would go out in the morning to garden and feed the flock of California quail who hid in the tiny bamboo thicket on the edge of his yard. They came so often we used to call them his little chickens.</p> 
                   <p>You really shouldn't feed wild animals, but in a fantasy game it's harmless fun.</p> 
                   <h4>Shrine Inarizushi — Level 1</h4> 
                   <p><b>Divination, Consumable, Divine</b><br> <b>Usage</b> held in 1 hand; <b>Bulk</b> L</p> 
                   <p><b>Activate</b> one minute (Interact)<br> A splash of sacred sake in the rice vinegar used to prepare this sushi makes it a suitable offering to the goddess Daikitsu and her favored fox servants. You place the sushi before a shrine of the goddess Daikitsu or in a wilderness area that naturally harbors foxes. For the next hour, whenever you are in exploration mode, roll a separate Search activity check with a +1 status bonus; this does not affect your Speed. If the check succeeds, a fox appears to inform you of this discovery as best as it can, although it cannot speak.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Sen.H.H.S.</h3> 
                   <p>In the days leading up to Chinese New Year, my family and I often visit Songshan Ciyou Temple for our annual prayers to the gods there. Like many other temples here, Ciyou Temple hosts a multitude of Taoist-Buddhist gods under one roof. Other than just for convenience, I think it is also a testimony of variety and complexity within a culture, something I do my best to reflect in my writing.</p> 
                   <p>Last year has been a full-on bumpy ride, but it was consequently highly rewarding. I learned a lot, tried a lot, and flailed a lot in the process. I’m grateful to be a member of the greater Paizo creative community as their support means the world to me. There is a lot to look forward to, and since I can’t talk about many of them right now, follow me on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/SenHHS">@SenHHS</a>) for when those announcements drop!</p> 
                   <p>Wishing everyone a happy Year of the Tiger! *Roar*</p> 
                   <h4>Incense Bundle of Annual Blessings — Item 8</h4> 
                   <p><b>Consumable, Magical</b><br> <b>Usage</b> held in 1 hand; <b>Bulk</b> L</p> 
                   <p>The twelve incense sticks wrapped in this bundle vary in shade and color, reflecting the deities the months are named after. Offering all incense sticks to their respective deities within a week is said to bring unparalleled luck, though gaining entry to all the necessary shrines and temples can pose quite a challenge. Those that complete the challenge gain can, when affected by a misfortune effect, automatically disrupt it as the incense wards off the bad luck. This ability can be used once a month for the next 12 months.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Jessie Lo</h3> 
                   <p>Hi I’m Jessie, you can find me on my Pathfinder 2e podcast <a rhef="https://twitter.com/GobletsandGays">@GobletsandGays</a> and on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/akinomii_art">@akinomii_art</a>. During Chinese New Year, it is very common to give out hongbao, red packets/envelopes, to your loved ones. Usually, they contain money, which is used to wish good luck, health, and wealth for the new year. It's also common to give out red packets as gifts, which often means a red packet is reused by several people until it wears out. It has also become common to get red packets from malls, which usually have a piece of chocolate, candy or special coupons.</p> 
                   <h4>Hongbao of Many Things — Item 5</h4> 
                   <p><b>Conjuration, Magical</b><br> <b>Usage</b> held in 1 hand; <b>Bulk</b> L</p> 
                   <p>This enchanted long, red envelope is decorated with beautiful illustrations in gold ink. The hongbao holds twelve slips safely within.</p> 
                   <p><b>Activate</b> [one-action] Interact; <b>Effect</b> You draw a randomly selected slip from the hongbao, which transforms permanently into a useful item. Until you draw another item, the illustration on the outside of the hongbao changes to one of twelve animals, matching the item pulled. Each slip can be drawn only once; after the last slip is gone, the hongbao becomes a non-magical red envelope that retains the illustration of the final slip drawn. The effects of each slip are as follows:</p> 
                   <ol> 
                    <li>3d4 small firecracker pellets that let out a loud squeak when thrown against a hard surface. </li>
                    <li>Embroidered leather armor made from oxhide.</li> 
                    <li>A <em>lesser healing potion</em>, except it is applied as a balm instead of drunk.</li> 
                    <li>A stuffed bunny dressed in red robes.</li> 
                    <li>50 feet of coiled silk rope.</li> 
                    <li>A bottle of snake wine.</li> 
                    <li>A wooden, horse-drawn wagon.</li> 
                    <li>A musical instrument made out of a ram’s horn.</li> 
                    <li>A collapsible metal-banded bo staff.</li> 
                    <li>An ornate jeweled egg.</li> 
                    <li>A small, jade, statuette of a guardian lion dog.</li> 
                    <li>6 delicious pork buns that function as emergency rations.</li>

                   <h3>Tan Shao Han</h3> 
                   <p>Happy Lunar New Year! May you all enjoy roaring good fortune in the year of the tiger! Based in Singapore, Shao Han (<a href="https://www.curiouschimeras.com/">https://www.curiouschimeras.com/</a>) is a member of the #RPGSEA movement who has created content for various RPGs, including Pathfinder 2, Blades in the Dark, and ARC. Fun fact: Due to Shao Han being taller than most of his family, he enjoys a +1 to his Cooking Lore checks when eating yusheng, and adds the reach trait and gains the critical specialization effects on his chopsticks attacks.</p> 
                   <h4>Seven-Color Raw Fish Salad — Item 8</h4> 
                   <p><b>Consumable, Divination, Fortune, Magical</b><br> <b>Price</b> 88 gp<br> <b>Usage</b> Prepared with 2 hands; <b>Bulk</b> 1</p> 
                   <p>An appetizer popularized in Goka, seven-color raw fish salad (qicai yusheng) is both fun and tasty to eat. This large platter of salad of raw fish, seafood, fruits, and vegetables of various hues is dressed in generous drizzlings of crushed peanuts, plum sauce, and sesame oil. During the Lunar New Year, consuming the seven-color raw fish salad (as 'seven colors' sounds similar to 'seven riches') is a grand, often messy, affair of spectacle and skill. Diners gather around the platter with long chopsticks to toss the salad, lifting the assorted ingredients as high as possible without dropping them off the table; erudite diners lead the table in uttering auspicious sayings to wish good fortune for the new year.</p> 
                   <p><b>Activate</b> 1 minute (command, Interact); <b>Effect</b> You toss the ingredients of the seven-color raw fish salad into the air to prepare the dish. You must attempt a DC 20 Cooking Lore check, with the following results.</p> 
                   <p><b>Critical Success</b> You manage to toss the ingredients deftly without wasting food, and your enthusiastic recitation of auspicious sayings is well received—a sign of impending good fortune! For the first month of the coming year, you enjoy a +2 bonus to skill checks to Earn Income and Diplomacy checks made to Gather Information about job opportunities.</p> 
                   <p><b>Success</b> You toss the ingredients adroitly, wasting a minimum of seafood, and your delivery of auspicious sayings is respectable. For the first month of the coming year, you gain a +1 bonus to skill checks to Earn Income and Diplomacy checks made to Gather Information about job opportunities.</p> 
                   <p><b>Failure</b> You fumble too many of the ingredients to have enough left to eat.</p>

                  <blockquote> 
                   <p itemprop="description">Paizo and Gale Force Nine have agreed on a multi-game partnership to publish original Pathfinder and Starfinder board games.</p> 
                   <p>Gale Force Nine (GF9), known for producing games such as “Firefly: The Game” and “Dune: A Game of Conquest and Diplomacy”, have teamed up with Paizo to publish original board and card games drawing from the worlds of Pathfinder and Starfinder. The multi-year partnership will see GF9 exploring the rich settings of Golarion, the Pact Worlds, and beyond to bring the heroes, villains, locations, and monsters from the roleplaying systems into several new boardgames. </p> 
                   <p>Starting in Q2 2022, Gale Force Nine will release two board games and one card game over the first year of the partnership, with more following over the course of the relationship. The first three titles are:</p> 
                   <ul> 
                    <li><em>Pathfinder: Level 20</em> (Q2 2022)</li> 
                    <li><em>Starfinder: Pirates of Skydock</em> (Q3 2022)</li> 
                    <li><em>Pathfinder: Tall Tales</em> (Q4 2022)</li> 
                   </ul> 
                   <p>“The worlds of Pathfinder and Starfinder are fun, diverse, and full of character,” says John-Paul Brisigotti, CEO of GF9. “We are excited to explore them further and offer fans of these games an opportunity to interact with the worlds in a new way.” </p> 
                   <p>We look forward to partnering with Gale Force Nine in bringing the Pathfinder and Starfinder worlds to life as board games,” says Paizo President, Jeff Alvarez. </p> 
                   <h3>Pathfinder: Level 20</h3> 
                   <p>The first game of this partnership, releasing in Q2 2022, is <em>Pathfinder: Level 20</em>, a game where players take on the role of kobolds in their warren, scampering away from a 19th-level fighter who only needs five XP to hit level 20.</p> 
                   <p>Will you make the heroes scamper away in embarrassment, thus being crowned the kobold champion? Or will you be the last survivor among your friends, a victory in its own right!</p> 
                   <p>Pathfinder: Level 20 is a game for 2–6 players and will be available in April with an MSRP of $30. Visit <a href="http://www.gf9games.com/pathfinder">www.gf9games.com/pathfinder</a> for more information.</p>

                  <blockquote> 
                   <p itemprop="description">Hello, Pathfinders! With the release of two more Year 3 metaplot scenarios yesterday, the Year of Shattered Sanctuaries is in full swing. This blog introduces the concept of the “metaplot” for those who may not be familiar. I’ll also be providing a rundown of the Year 3 metaplot stories so you have all the information in one place. Let’s get to it!</p> 
                   <p>Each year of Pathfinder Society adventures includes “metaplot scenarios,” which tell a linked story. You can think of the metaplot like the “main plot” of a TV series. There are non-metaplot scenarios as well, which typically have fewer connections to the major plot events.</p> 
                   <h3>Year 3 Metaplot</h3> 
                   <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/7ce22669-6db3-4db3-861e-454d71b30330/YearofShatteredSanctuaries_Title.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/7ce22669-6db3-4db3-861e-454d71b30330/YearofShatteredSanctuaries_Title.png" width="50%" style="padding: 10px;" alt="Year of Shattered Sanctuaries"></a>

                   </div> 
                   <p>The Year 3 metaplot includes 14 adventures. One of the challenges of creating a metaplot is that many players will play the adventures in a different order, sometimes based on which characters they have at different levels, or which adventures are being offered at their preferred venues. Asking everyone to play 14 adventures in the same order wouldn’t work too well! So, we broke Year 3 up into six “metaplot arcs.” Each arc tells a small part of the overall Year 3 story. You can play some of the arcs, or all of them, as you like. Each arc tells a contained story which fits into a broader narrative. In the case of Year 3, each of these arcs tells the story of a strange disaster befalling a Pathfinder Society lodge in one of six nations in the Inner Sea: Absalom, Andoran, Cheliax, Osirion, Qadira, and Taldor.</p> 
                   <p>Within the Year 3 metaplot, you can think of the Absalom storyline as the “A plot,” and the other storylines as side plots. The Absalom arc contains both the introduction and conclusion of the metaplot as a whole.</p> 
                   <h3>Year 3 Metaplot Arcs</h3>

                   <h3>Enjoy the arcs in any order!</h3> 
                   <p>You can play these metaplot arcs in any order. For example, you could start with the Qadira arc (the first scenario came out yesterday!) and then go back to the Andoran arc, the Cheliax arc, or even the intro scenario. This means there are several possible entry points into the Year 3 story. Every single scenario in the metaplot is playable with our Pathfinder Society pregenerated characters (available at levels 1, 3, and 5), with one exception: the final scenario in the Absalom arc is level 7–10, so you’ll need your own character in that level range if you’re playing for Pathfinder Society credit.</p> 
                   <h3>Final Recommendations</h3> 
                   <p>Though you can play the arcs in any order (Qadira before Andoran, or the other way around), when you’re looking at the individual adventures within a given arc, I recommend that you play them in the order they were released. The above list shows the intended order within each arc. There is no “rule” which requires you to play Part 1 before Part 2, but the story within each arc is going to make more sense if you do.</p> 
                   <p>There is no “right” or “wrong” approach to the Year of Shattered Sanctuaries. Pick an arc, or any scenario that sounds fun, and dive into the story!</p> 
                   <p>As always, please keep your hands and arms inside the sanctuaries while you explore, report, and cooperate your way through Year 3!</p>

                   <p>I’ve had the good fortune to write a lot for Pathfinder and helped to invent a fair portion of its deities, but always in the context of the fantasy genre. The chance to revisit some of these elements in a different genre is exciting and liberating. after spending decades with deities like Desna and Sarenrae flitting around in my head as divinities first in my homebrew game and then more recently in Golarion. Alas, there was only so much room to talk about Desnan dream stations or to explore the implications of what worshiping the goddess of the sun might entail when you’re in outer space, but hopefully the entries in this book will help spark new ideas for how to use these deities in your game! And of course, on the opposite side of the “friendliness scale,” being able to lean into the science-fiction tropes of the classic pulps and explore how Nyarlathotep and the Elder Mythos functions in Starfinder was equally delightful. But the thing I’m most excited to see once this book’s out is all the amazing content created by all the other authors in this book!</p>

                   <h3>Jessica Catalan (she/her)<br> <em style="font-size: 15;">Starfinder Society Developer</em></h3> 
                   <p>Hello! My name is Jessica Catalan and I’m the Starfinder Society Developer. I’m also a mother, gamer, blogger, and freelance author who primarily writes for Paizo’s Starfinder and Pathfinder RPGs. You can find a list of my currently announced writing credits on my Paizo profile (meloriel). Some recently released highlights include <em>Secrets of Magic, Guns &amp; Gears, Lost Omens Grand Bazaar, Galaxy Exploration Manual,</em> and <em>Tech Revolution</em>.</p> 
                   <p>For <em>Galactic Magic</em>, I wrote the mystic and witchwarper class options, twenty spells, and numerous deities, including Kadrical, Lamashtu, and all the ancestral deities. <em>Galactic Magic</em> also marks two big firsts for me. This is the first time I was hired to create entirely new deities of my own design (Dagosarn, Flux, Isvith, Jalvari, Meyel, Romgul, Uvonn, and the Vesk Saints). <em>Galactic Magic</em> is also the first time I was hired for freelance development work, making this my very first developer credit.</p> 
                   <p>I’m beyond thrilled to have been a part of this book and I look forward to seeing it hit gaming tables! Enjoy!</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Rigby Bendele (they/them or xe/xem)</h3> 
                   <p>I'm a sometimes-poet, sometimes-game designer doing my best to make engaging, inclusive tabletop games. In <em>Galactic Magic</em>, you'll find my work in the technomancer and Oras section. When I was writing the Oras section, I thought quite a bit about Donna Haraway's "A Cyborg Manifesto" and the way in which cyborgs offer a rejection of the separations between animal, human and machine. This should probably tell you that I'm a queer theory nerd (which is the crux of my academic background) and that I love thinking about alternative ways of being through TTRPGs. While <em>Galactic Magic</em> is my first hardcover with Paizo, you'll find my name on more books soon and can enjoy more of my Starfinder work with <em>SFS #3-07: Strike at Zone 78</em> and <em>SFS #4-04: Mission Not Found</em>.</p>

                   <h3>Kendra Leigh Speedling (she/her)</h3> 
                   <p>Hello, all! I’m Kendra Leigh Speedling, and I’ve been freelancing for Pathfinder and Starfinder for about six years. You might remember me from this year’s Starfinder GenCon special, <em>#3-99: Perils of the Past</em>. I’m delighted to have been a part of <em>Galactic Magic</em>, helping give the “fantasy” side of “science-fantasy” some love. I did several sections for the book, including the faith introduction, the Besmara and Weydan entries, the Parallel Truths, and the new operative class options. I’ve always been fond of exploring how magic and faith interact with a highly technologically advanced setting, so this assignment was a lot of fun. I particularly enjoyed crafting the operative options, which hopefully add a little magical flair to your operative of choice!</p> 
                   <p>I’ve got a few more Pathfinder and Starfinder projects in the works currently, though most of them are still Forbidden Knowledge at this point. I can confirm, though, that I got my grabby hands involved in Pathfinder’s upcoming <em>Book of the Dead</em>! In my non-freelancing downtime, I can be found hanging out with a book or video game—usually Animal Crossing these days—or pretending I know how to bake. You can find a full list of my writing credits at klspeedling.com and I’m on Twitter as <a href="https://twitter.com/KendraLS">@KendraLS</a>, where I sporadically post cat pictures.</p>

                   <p>Hello, readers! Sen.H.H.S. here. You might have seen my name before in some Pathfinder Second Edition products such as <em>Bestiary 3, Secrets of Magic</em>, and many others. (See my carrd for the full list: <a href="https://senhhs.carrd.co/#portfolio">https://senhhs.carrd.co/#portfolio</a>) With <em>Galactic Magic</em>, it looks like I've made the jump over to write even more magic in a different(?) universe. This book has been a long time coming, and I hope you'll get to experience the magic (pun intended) within its pages soon. You can always find out what I'm up to on my Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/SenHHS">@SenHHS</a>.

                   <p>Hi, I'm Shay Snow, I'm an editor at Paizo, and I wrote up a bunch of species-specific spells and the entry on Zon-Kuthon, surprising exactly... no one! As my mutuals on Twitter know I'm a pretty big Zon-Kuthon fan so I joyfully jumped when offered the chance to give the pain man a new write up for <em>Galactic Magic</em>. You may have seen me in a few Starfinder scenarios, Pathfinder’s <em>Lost Omens Grand Bazaar</em> and <em>Tech Revolution</em> and I have a few things coming out in <em>Lost Omens Monsters of Myth.</em> Additionally, you can find my name on a few <em>Coyote &amp; Crow</em> projects!</p> 
                   <p>When not writing, I’m usually discussing Native issues and rights over on my Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/SpellsInSugar">@SpellsInSuga</a>r, where you can also sometimes catch me talking about video games and horror media.

                   <p>Hi! I'm Jess, and I wrote about some fabulous outsider deities in <em>Galactic Magic</em> ! Even though it's a smaller section, I'm particularly proud of my work in this book. It gave me an opportunity to introduce a lot of cool content into Starfinder, and there are some lines scattered through the section that are quite personal to me. I won't spoil which gods are included, but if you're familiar with my past work for PF and SF, some of them are very "me." :) I hope you like Starfinder's new and returning outsider deities as much as I do!</p> 
                   <p>For more of my content check out Valiant, an actual play Pathfinder podcast on the Know Direction network, where I play Xiadani the aasimar druid. You can also find me <a href="https://twitter.com/tectonomancer">@tectonomancer</a> on Twitter.</p>

                   <h3>Mikhail Rekun (he/him)</h3> 
                   <p>дравствуйте, уважаемые читатели! My name is Mikhail Sergeyevich Rekun, and you may recognize me from previous Starfinder products such as the <em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em> (where I wrote about Accord and created the Starship Toolbox) and <em>Starfinder Adventure Path #31: Waking the Worldseed</em> (where I wrote the Hibb article), along with plenty of Pathfinder stuff. In my more mundane life, I’m a Russian-American historian, educator, and author.</p> 
                   <p><em>Galactic Magic</em> was a bit of a weird project for me. John Compton contacted me and said ‘we need magical nanomachines and we need them as soon as humanly possible.’ Well, I’m never one to shirk from a challenge, and produced the magical options for the nanocyte in basically a weekend. I’m reasonably pleased with the results, especially the ability to make fancy nano-runes and sigils like a proper anime protagonist. (That was what John wanted, right?)</p> 
                   <p>Nanites are also of some interest to me for other reasons, as when not writing for Paizo, I’m working on <em>Ourichor: Fulcrum of the Luminant Age</em> alongside the inimitable Andrew Mullen and Isabelle Thorne (follow us at https://twitter.com/LuminantA). I shan’t share too much in the way of details, but let’s just say that fans of microscopic shenanigans may find our upcoming release, <em>Armaments of the Luminant Age</em>, of some interest to them.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>John Godek III (he/him)</h3> 
                   <p>Hi everyone! My name is John Godek and I am an avid Starfinder GM, player, freelance author, and podcaster. I had the opportunity to write several sections of <em>Galactic Magic</em> and I can’t wait for you to see them! I created two brand new soldier fighting styles—the spellbrawler and the archer—along with new weapons, gear boosts, fusions, and armor upgrades that synergize with these styles as well as offer cool options for other styles and classes. In addition, I formulated nearly three dozen new magic spells, including spells that provide basic utility, create different types of barriers, and are related to or originated in the Vast. Finally, I crafted three new legendary artifacts of tremendous power, each steeped in ancient lore. Other Paizo projects I have forthcoming include work on the Drift Crisis hardcover, backmatter in <em>Starfinder Adventure Path #44</em>, and my very first adventure—<em>Starfinder Bounty #1: The Cantina Job</em>!</p> 
                   <p>You can find me playing with the Emerald City Lodge in Seattle, or you can listen to my podcasts on the Know Direction Network, including: Digital Divination with Ron Lundeen, Intrepid Heroes, a Stafinder actual play, and Presenting, a podcast where I interview game designers, developers, artists, and writers.</p>

                   <p>Evening, everyone. I’m Nate Wright, a blogger on the Know Direction Network and a freelancer who has contributed to multiple works from Paizo. Some of my favorites include the anadi ancestry from <em>Lost Omens The Mwangi Expanse</em> and the memetic zenith from <em>Starfinder Adventure Path #24: The God-Host Ascends</em>. The best part about writing for this book has been visualizing the awesome abilities I’ve always wished my character could have and getting the opportunity to share that vision with the rest of the community.</p>

                   <p>Hi folks! My name is Dennis Muldoon, and I've been freelancing for Paizo for a few years now. I've contributed to almost every line Paizo publishes, now, most recently <em>SFS #4-10: The Way In</em>, the Azlanti Space Age material in the toolbox of <em>Starfinder Adventure Path #42: Whispers of the Eclipse</em>, and the ssumzili and golgopo monsters in <em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #171: Hurricane's Howl</em>. For Galactic Magic, I wrote the experimental apparatus mechanic alternate class feature for all your magically inclined mechanic needs, along with magic-themed mechanic tricks for mechanics of all types. I'm also extremely excited to bring the Lucky Drunk himself into Starfinder with a section on Cayden Cailean!

                   <p>Hey, Starfinder fans! I’m Kate, and I’ve been writing for Starfinder and Pathfinder for about five years. I was delighted to get to write the sections on Hylax and Talavet for this book. Hylax is near and dear to my heart after writing one of the Attack of the Swarm volumes, and I even have a tattoo of the <em>Crown of Hylax</em>! Talavet speaks to me equally, with such a strong focus on the importance of stories, something I’ve never appreciated more than in the last year and a half. I hope you enjoy reading about their role in the galaxy, along with the many other deities featured in this book.</p>

                  <blockquote> 
                   <h2>THE WIND BENEATH THE PEAKS</h2> 
                   <p itemprop="description">The sky was scabbed over with ominous looking clouds, but Amiri refused to take them as an ill omen. Just being back here in these mountains was all the bad luck she needed.</p> 
                   <p>Amiri hadn’t yet decided just how much of a fool she was for coming back to the lands of her birth. Just on the other side of these peaks lay the place where she’d stood drenched in the blood of her kin: the finest warriors of the Six Bears. Men she had called her brothers. Her friends. She had felt the heat of their blood fading from her skin and known she could never go home again.</p> 
                   <p>She’d told herself she never wanted to.</p> 
                   <p>And in the time since, she never had. Until now. Following a witch-woman’s words of warning and promise. Because though in all that time she’d never wanted to return these lands had never fully loosed their hold on her.</p> 
                   <p>Amiri gritted her teeth as she hauled herself over the sheer flank of a boulder. From here she could see down the slope toward the overgrown valley below and peer up toward the snow-crusted peaks. Not a single crow cawed. No mice scuttled among the rocks and scree.</p> 
                   <p>More bad omens, maybe. Or they’d been scared off by a lumbering warrior who’d forgotten the way of navigating easily through this landscape, she thought, and spat.</p> 
                   <p>“Told you it was a bad idea.” she muttered, though there was no one else to hear. She’d told herself it was a bad idea just about every step of the way, but she couldn’t get the witch-woman’s words out of her head.</p> 
                   <p>The town was nothing special. Just a cluster of unremarkable houses, preyed on by unremarkable bandits who were foolish enough to mistake Amiri for an easy target. She hadn’t even known the town was there until the residents greeted her cheering, at the gates. They’d insisted on a feast, and who was Amiri to turn down free food?</p> 
                   <p>The witch-woman’s gift had been less welcome.</p> 
                   <p>“I don’t have any gold to offer, but I have a fortune,” she'd said.</p> 
                   <p>“Knowing the future only ever causes trouble.” Amiri replied with a grunt, starting to turn away, but the woman had held on with a surprisingly firm grip.</p> 
                   <p>“You hear the whispers. The wind among the peaks. When you wake, when you sleep. You hear their voices. The men you killed. You hear them mocking you. You hear them cursing you.”</p> 
                   <p>“Leave me be.” Amiri had growled, but the woman was relentless.</p> 
                   <p>“I see you returning to the land of your birth. I see two stray cubs, a broken blade. I see your heart torn from your chest,” the woman intoned.</p> 
                   <p>“My heart torn from my chest?” Amiri echoed, skeptical. “Doesn’t sound like something I ought to go looking for.”</p> 
                   <p>The old woman shrugged. “Could be a metaphor. Can’t always tell with these things. But I hear the splintering of bones.” The smoke from the cookfire twined around them, strangely thick.</p> 
                   <p>“You’re telling me if I go back there... what? I find some kind of peace?” Amiri had asked, voice sharp with scorn. She was a creature of battle and bloodshed, not peace.</p> 
                   <p>Though maybe sometimes she did hear the wind howling in the peaks. Maybe sometimes she even thought she imagined voices in that wind, and felt—what? Not guilt or regret, exactly.</p> 
                   <p>More the sense of something unfinished.</p> 
                   <p>“Peace? No. A kind of silence, maybe.” the witch said.</p> 
                   <p>That night Amiri dreamed of howling wind and when she set out in the morning, her path bent northward.</p> 
                   <p>Part of her had almost expected spirits of vengeance to come screaming out of the sky the moment she entered the Six Bears’ territory but so far, her journey had been uneventful. She was skirting the edge of it now, just at the border of her old clan’s hunting grounds. If everything was as barren as this, it must have been a lean winter.</p> 
                   <p>A skittering of rock drew her attention up the slope. She almost missed it—a flash of gray against gray, something ducking behind a stone. Then came a tiny yip and a growl. She wasn’t entirely alone here, then.</p> 
                   <p><em>Two stray cubs</em>, she thought.</p> 
                   <p>“Bad idea.” She reminded herself. But, shaking her head, she started up the slope. The footing was unstable and twice she slid back down a foot or two, almost losing her grip on the mountainside. But finally, she hauled herself up to where the small form had vanished. There was a cleft in the rock—a cave, too small for a human, but large enough for an animal’s den, perhaps. Amiri crouched, peering into the darkness.</p> 
                   <p>In her experience, fortune telling and prophecy were infuriatingly vague or uselessly symbolic. Irony and prophecy were for bards as far as she was concerned. Just tell her what a thing was plainly—and how to kill it. So she wasn’t really expecting to find two stray cubs in this den. That would be too easy. Too <em>literal</em>.</p> 
                   <p>Amiri took a strip of jerky from her pack and held it out. “Come on. Be simple for once,” she muttered, and tossed it on the ground just outside the den.</p> 
                   <p>Two glowing eyes appeared in the darkness. A second set blinked just behind. Wolves’ eyes, Amiri thought, and for one bright moment let herself believe that she might find her “stray cubs” and be done with this whole business.</p> 
                   <p>The nearer beast sprang forward. Amiri leapt back with a wordless sound of surprise. She’d been mistaken—that hadn’t been the click of claws she heard, but of hooves and talons.</p> 
                   <p>The cub was a hideously proportioned thing—a fawn’s spindly front legs, an oversized wolf cub’s head, the nubs of antlers pushing up from its blunt and blood-speckled brow. Ragged wings, pinfeathers not yet grown in, sprouted from its back, and its hind end sported the wicked talons of a bird of prey at the end of each scaly foot.</p> 
                   <p>The peryton cub snarled at her, hunching over the piece of jerky. The second cub scrambled out, diving for the meat, and the two snapped and tore at each other, their antics almost sending them rolling down the side of the mountain.</p> 
                   <p>Amiri grimaced, putting a hand to the dagger at her belt. The beasts were the size of small dogs now—not much of a threat. But they’d grow fast, and perytons were vicious, evil things. Fully grown, they delighted in tearing the hearts from men’s chests. Just like the witch had seen.</p> 
                   <p>Was this all the witch wanted from her? Come here, kill a couple of perytons before they could grow up and threaten the Six Bears? Penance for her crimes.</p> 
                   <p>As if that would wipe away the past.</p> 
                   <p>She drew the dagger. The witch said find the cubs. She’d found them. She’d put them down and leave and forget she was ever foolish enough to listen to an old woman’s rambling fortunes.</p> 
                   <p>The cubs seemed to notice her at last. They looked up, their muzzles and faces plastered with blood. No wonder the slopes were so quiet. Even fledglings would go after anything with a heart they could pry from its chest. The two growled at her, advancing. Utterly fearless. Like they completely believed the combined fifty pounds of them could take out a full-grown warrior.</p> 
                   <p>Wind stirred Amiri’s hair.</p> 
                   <p>Or maybe they were fearless for another reason.</p> 
                   <p>Amiri threw herself to the side the second before a massive beast slammed into the rock where she’d been standing. It whirled in a storm of fur and feathers and flashing claws, a howl of rage in its throat.</p>

                   <br> 
                   <p>She let out an oath. The thing was <em>massive</em>, bigger than any peryton she'd seen—or heard of. Its ragged gray fur was striped with scars and liberally stained with blood. Bits of dried gore hung like macabre ornaments from its broad antlers, and when it spread its wings, they blocked out the sky, casting Amiri in shadow.</p> 
                   <p>Amiri grinned. This was more like it. She sheathed her dagger. Planted her feet. And gripped the hilt of her massive sword. Its weight strained her shoulders, pulled at her arms. But she could feel the familiar, welcome heat uncoiling through her veins. That bitter taste was on her tongue and her heart raced with that mix of danger and eagerness and fury—fury that this creature would dare to face her. Fury it would think it could stand against her strength and blade. That it would think her <em>prey</em>.</p> 
                   <p>“Come on, then!” she screamed at the beast. It rose on its hind legs, beating its great wings and sending blasts of wind that tore the loose rocks and pebbles from the hillside, sending them tumbling.</p> 
                   <p>An arrow hissed through the air. It struck the peryton’s flank with a dull, meaty thud. It howled in rage and pain, its attention twisting away from Amiri. Toward the young woman standing a hundred feet away, feet braced, setting another arrow to her quiver. A young man crouched next to her. They wore hunters’ leathers, and by the matching red-gold shade of their hair and their angular features, they looked to be brother and sister.</p> 
                   <p>The peryton leapt for the young woman. Amiri screamed out a curse and threw herself after. The girl loosed another arrow, but the peryton’s leap had startled her, and it went wide.</p> 
                   <p>Amiri knew she wouldn’t make it to the pair in time. Knew the girl’s hands, quick and sure as they were, weren’t quick enough to nock another arrow. Nothing would stop the creature’s murderous dive. Unless—</p> 
                   <p>The man lifted his hands. The air seemed to bend and fold in front of his palms and a crack like thunder boomed out. The peryton’s charge broke. It slewed away in the air, snarling in pain and shock. The edge of the blast of sound tore past Amiri, slamming into her shoulder, leaving her ears ringing.</p> 
                   <p>The peryton climbed into the air with powerful beats of its wings. Amiri leapt the last few feet to the rock where the two youths stood.</p> 
                   <p>“It’s coming back around,” she warned.</p> 
                   <p>“I can see that.” the young woman snapped, her gaze tracking the beast as it rose, as it turned.</p> 
                   <p>It seemed to hesitate. Its gaze shifted away from the trio, tracking higher up the mountain slope.</p> 
                   <p>Then Amiri heard it. Not the scrape and skitter of a few dislodged stones, but a deep, desultory rumbling. She looked up just as, high above, the mountainside gave way.</p> 
                   <p>“Rockslide!” the young man cried. The peryton let out a warbling howl and dove, but not at the three of them this time—toward its cubs, their half-feathered wings useless to take them out of the path of the rapidly growing avalanche of stone. It swept them up in its hind talons and angled away in seconds as Amiri and the other two sprinted down the slope.</p> 
                   <p>“Don’t suppose that magic of yours can stop a rockslide?” Amiri shouted over the growing din.</p> 
                   <p>“Just start them, apparently.” he tossed back with a reckless grin, and Amiri couldn’t help but answer it.</p> 
                   <p>Over his shoulder she spotted it: a blot of darkness—a cave entrance.</p> 
                   <p>“There.” she said, pointing. The two didn’t need her to explain. The sister got there first but she stopped, waited as her brother reached her and dove past before she flitted in after him.</p> 
                   <p>The dust cloud riding the front edge of the avalanche swept over Amiri, blotting out her vision and swallowing the light. She threw herself toward the cave opening just as the rockslide hit.</p> 
                   <p>There was no light, only darkness and furious sound, as if the whole mountain was coming apart overhead. Amiri scrambled back from the entrance. Stones rained down. Above her sounded a horrible grinding and groaning—then a crack. The cave entrance was giving way. Amiri roared, bracing herself beneath her sword, as if she could hold the whole mountain up.</p> 
                   <p>The roof of the cave collapsed over her.</p>

                   <h4>CHAPTER 1: CLASSES</h4> 
                   <p>PRECOG<br> Through some cosmic event, you have come to understand the ebb and flow of time to a degree that only a select few can. You manipulate time dexterously—accelerating, slowing, or even reshaping chronologies to suit your needs. The skeins of time are yours to see, and you know how to apply enough pressure to adjust their threads ever so subtly. Your ability to understand the infinite possibilities of time also shaped you into someone capable of altering the material universe through powerful spellcasting, and you can harness temporal paradoxes to foresee the future—and dictate the present—in powerful ways. </p>

                   <h4>CHAPTER 2: GEAR </h4> 
                   <p>HYBRID ITEMS <br> Blends of magic and technology achieve results that neither alone could ever imagine, creating the likes of null-space storage, miniaturized vehicles, subwoofers able to inspire supernatural fear, artificial lifeforms that require virtually no sustenance, and more. These devices often resist strictly antimagical or anti-technological countermeasures.</p> 
                   <p>MAGIC ITEMS<br> Traditional magic items translate mystical energies into a portable format that nearly anyone can use. Part of the appeal comes from unshakable nostalgia, yet far more often it’s magic items’ total disregard for scientific principles—their ability to translate their maker’s will into reality—that makes them so unique and valuable. </p> 
                   <p>WEAPON FUSIONS AND ARMOR UPGRADES<br> Survival often means eking out maximum performance from an adventurer’s gear, and a magical upgrade provides an easy edge. These weapon fusions and armor upgrades concentrate eldritch energy into functional, long-lasting forms, and these latest models lend even the most technologically outfitted explorer an arcane advantage.</p> 
                   <p>ARTIFACTS<br> Artifacts are exceedingly rare—often unique—items beyond the ability of any but the most accomplished artisans to create, and they’re almost as difficult to destroy. These legendary items combine tremendous power with the intrinsic lore that shapes their abilities. Adventurers might dedicate their entire lives to finding a specific artifact, and recovering an artifact might spur countless high-stakes exploits.</p>

                   <p>OVERVIEW<br> Magic can be measured, manipulated, and predicted, or else it never could’ve been integrated with technology. Even so, cultures perceive magic in wildly different ways, and a lot of magical phenomena remains associated with myth, antiquity, physical impossibilities, and secrets perhaps better left alone. In short, despite being integrated into everyday society, magic remains... magical</p>

                   <p>A Pathfinder Society Scenario designed for levels 1-4.</p> 
                   <p>Following their recent successes in aiding the government of Qadira with apprehending an errant genie-binder, the Pathfinder Society earned the right to establish a new lodge in the port city of Sedeq! With the construction of the site complete, the Society sent a group to formally begin operations from the new edifice.</p> 
                   <p>They never arrived.</p> 
                   <p>With city officials threatening to auction off the new building should the Pathfinder Society neglect to occupy it, the Society sends another group of Pathfinders to investigate the lodge. Finding the brand new structure in a state of alarming disrepair, the Pathfinders have little time to search for answers before a booming voice greets them. If they wish to occupy the lodge, they’ll have to complete three tasks... </p> 
                   <p>“Foundation’s Price” is part of the ongoing story of the Year of Shattered Sanctuaries. It’s the first scenario in a two-part arc detailing the events befalling a Pathfinder Society lodge in the nation of Qadira. Other arcs explore other locations across the Inner Sea. While these arcs can be played in any order, it’s recommended that players experience the scenarios within each individual arc in order.</p>

                   <p>The Pathfinder Society has had a tenuous relationship with the government of the ancient nation of Osirion ever since the Ruby Prince increased restrictions on the activities of foreign-based explorers. Venture-Captain Norden Balentiir has worked hard to restore the Society’s reputation in the nation, and to guide the Sandswept Hall, the Pathfinder lodge in Osirion’s capital, away from its dark past.</p> 
                   <p>Recently, hordes of undead have been surging up from the depths of the Sandswept Hall. Norden Balentiir fears that should this threat become widely known, it would compel the Ruby Prince to permanently shut down Pathfinder operations in Osirion. The lodge’s forces are locked in constant battle with the undead, and they need an experienced strike team to descend into the Hall’s lower levels and find the source of the undead menace!</p>

                  <blockquote> 
                   <p itemprop="description">I remember the years of struggle. Long, stretching seasons where sunlight was sparse, and the hungry night arrived all too quickly. I remember the rites and songs as we laid follower after follower to rest, forced to move ever onward. Parent and child, animals, friends: none were safe as we carved our new paths and founded our new lives.</p> 
                   <p>Tonight, in the shadow of these great mountains, I share with you a story from another time. In this time, your grandparents were small, squalling babes—some of whom I sang lullabies to, heh!—and instead of a seer’s sharp mind, I had the strength and skill of a hunter.</p> 
                   <p>I was a young man back then, instead of Grandfather Eiwa. Oh yes, and I was a skilled archer! With the silence of a great cat I stalked prey. With the sharpness of eye to rival a falcon’s, I watched over our following. With the patience of a mammoth, I knew when to lay still and when to strike with all the strength I had. </p> 
                   <p>What I did not know was <em>when</em> to use each. Sometimes, a well-meaning action creates more trouble than anything.</p> 
                   <p>Take this journey with me, and see things as they were. The time of the year was close to the very season we enjoy now, when daylight just begins to stretch further than the darkness, and the snow finally begins to melt. Around our feet, the trails grew slushy and difficult to traverse, but the days began to grow brighter, and with them came hope. </p> 
                   <p>These were my favorite times of the year. The crispness of the blue sky was a welcome friend. Have you noticed that the sky never seems so bright, so vivid, as during the melts? Perhaps these days I am more comfortable in the warmer seasons, but I will always love the newness of the daylight, reborn and glorious, as it chases the hard winter away.</p> 
                   <p>During this time, we were only a few years into establishing the routes we now use every year. Both our herd and our numbers were still small; we had only recently started recruiting others into our following and teaching them the ways of the Broken Tusk. I was a young man, perhaps only a little older than some of you are now. Still an adult in the eyes of the following, but young enough to be over-eager to prove myself. </p> 
                   <p>My day’s task was to scout ahead. I was to learn which creatures had awakened from slumber, which patches of grass had revealed themselves from beneath the snow, and to ensure the herd’s next resting spot would be free of predators and other dangers.</p> 
                   <p>I took no partner with me save for Isul, my beloved friend, my air-rider. Such a magnificent falcon. He, too, was eager to explore the way ahead, and so I encouraged him to go. It was exhilarating to be exploring by myself, knowing Isul was not too far away. </p> 
                   <p>Stepping carefully along the sprouting grasses and dotted pools of melted snow, I came upon a spot that led to a shallow riverbed. I was stirred by its beauty and felt a swell of pride; this would be a fantastic resting spot for the herd. </p> 
                   <p>In my excitement, I did not pay close enough attention. For by the time I had approached, too late did I see the giant creature already exploring the waters.</p> 
                   <p>I froze in place, watching and waiting. Hoping the massive bear would be more interested in the potential fishing spot than in me. For now, it seemed oblivious to my presence. </p> 
                   <p>I should have let it be and reported back to the others. But a thought crossed my mind: how fantastic would it be, not just to return to the following with news of this beautiful resting site, but to crown that achievement with another: a grizzled bear already brought down to feed our people?</p> 
                   <p>I see some of you already shaking your heads at the thought. And you are right to do so. Well you know by now that you should never hunt bear by yourself. </p> 
                   <p>Only, I was convinced I was not alone. I could call for Isul, and together we could handle anything. And the longer I thought about it, the more I persuaded myself it was the best choice. Food was in short supply, after all, and the great creature could provide much. </p> 
                   <p>I crouched low in the muddy bank and began readying my bow. But when I looked up, I was not ready to see the great beast charging me! </p> 
                   <p>It had seen me; my presence startled it, and I suddenly understood how alone I really was. In the space of a few seconds, many thoughts ran through my mind: <em>where is Isul? I cannot outrun the bear. I don’t have time to make more than one shot. I should have waited. Ancestors, let me live through this and I shall not make this mistake again!</em></p> 
                   <p>The brown bear bounded toward me, then stopped short with a mighty thump of its front paws. It growled at me, teeth clacking. I began backing away from it slowly, hoping this was the only charge the creature would make.</p> 
                   <p>It was not. It surged forward again with similar body language, only this time it connected, knocking me back into the mud. Panic surging, I knew my greatest chance of living right now was to feign death. I rolled instantly to my stomach and cradled my head and neck with my arms. Already my hip was stinging from where the bear had made contact, but at least my instinct was correct. With a mighty thump that shook the mud, he stomped once more, but not on me.</p> 
                   <p>I could not see him, but in my mind’s eye, he was only a few scant feet away. <em>Let him be content, I prayed. Let him go away…</em></p> 
                   <p>He was not content. He did not go away. </p> 
                   <p>I felt the air leave my lungs as his snout dug under my side, trying to flip me over. Every last bit of me wanted to yelp, to flee. <em>No, do not flee, for you will make him chase you!</em> It took all my strength to keep my stomach to the ground, keep my arms shielding my head and neck.</p> 
                   <p>He must have been as frustrated as I, for the next thing I knew, I felt his snout at my hip again, strong claws burning into my leg. I felt a moment of weightlessness, soon followed by flattening, encompassing pain along the front of my body and an icy splash of water above my shoulders. I barely had enough time to lift my head and take a breath before continuing to feign death. <em>He tossed me into the water!</em></p> 
                   <p>Through the panic and the loud rush of water over my ears, it took me a moment before I realized two important things: first, despite the pain, I was still alive, and second: my hips were still connected to solid ground. I was not too far under the water.</p> 
                   <p>But there was still the bear! I held my breath, feeling another tap, this time at my ankle. <em>Leave me be</em>, I begged, remaining still as possible, half in the water and my lungs burning with need. <em>Go find something else, before playing dead becomes being dead!</em></p> 
                   <p>I felt nothing else. I knew I shouldn’t move until the bear was long gone. But my lungs were done recycling my one breath; I had no more. My body ached from claw and earth. Moving was my only chance at life, and yet if I moved while the bear was still near, it was certain death. </p> 
                   <p>I waited. And waited.</p> 
                   <p>I felt no more contact. </p> 
                   <p><em>Must…wait. </em></p> 
                   <p><em>Wait.</em></p> 
                   <p><em>Wait.</em></p> 
                   <p><em>I NEED AIR.</em></p> 
                   <p>I turned my head just enough to take in a breath and open one eye and was rewarded. For the bear had reared up, swiping at a blur of speed, dark feathers surrounding sharp eyes. Isul had returned! My beloved friend dove at the bear, distracting him, leading him away from me!</p> 
                   <p>I sat up gasping and, in frenzied haste, looked around for my bow. There! At the water’s edge! I dove for it despite my pain and saw more than felt my hand close around its haft. My other hand fumbled to draw an arrow from my quiver, and with horror, I realized only one remained! The others had tumbled out as the bear tossed me around.</p> 
                   <p>I had to make my shot count. I whistled sharply—a signal to Isul. My falcon friend responded immediately, as I knew he would. He circled up around the bear’s head once, leading the great creature just far enough away. In a moment, he would circle again and expose the bear’s chest and shoulder to me.</p>

                   <br> 
                   <p>It is very hard to get an exact shot at a bear’s heart, especially when it’s already aggravated. But Isul was well-practiced, and we had hunted together many times. This, at least, was a perfect moment in an otherwise-messy situation. Isul wheeled. The bear turned. For one frozen moment, our eyes met, the bear and me. And then, with more precision than I’d ever had, I loosed the arrow. </p> 
                   <p>The missile flew true, and I was rewarded with the telltale spray of blood, the muscular spasm as the animal decided whether to flee or fight . . . and then it slumped over.</p> 
                   <p>It took me a long moment to work up the nerve to ensure the bear was finished. But finished it was. I sent Isul back to the following with a message asking for assistance. It wasn’t precisely as I’d imagined; the following had to help me as much as help with the bear.</p> 
                   <p>And truly, my following, this is the most important lesson I can give from the tale tonight: we are best when we work together. We must learn to ask for—and accept!—help when needed. My intentions were good, but it was a foolish choice that nearly cost me my life, and nearly cost the following one of its hunters. We are made weaker with each loss of life, just as we are made stronger with each new addition to the following. </p> 
                   <p>This night, I see you all here with me, listening and learning our ways, honoring each other and those who came before. I see you gathered, people of all shapes, all sizes, and my heart is happy. We are stronger for having you. </p> 
                   <p>I celebrate you this night, Broken Tusks. And I know you will face bravely whatever challenges come your way.</p>

                   <p>When a simulated training mission becomes infected by the Data Scourge, the PCs are trapped in Guidance’s corrupted, rapidly deteriorating systems. To save Guidance, the PCs must counter the virus from inside the digital realm and escape before the system shuts down completely. <em><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02aom?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-413-Hard-Reset">Starfinder Society Scenario #4-13: Hard Reset</a></em> is a scenario for levels 1–4, written by Joseph Blomquist.</p> 
                   <p>Want to unravel the mystery of the Data Scourge? This is the adventure for you!</p>

                   <p>This month is quite a perilous one for Pathfinder Society’s Inner Sea lodges! You might say we’re looking to shatter a sanctuary or two. In other words, both of our new Pathfinder Society scenarios this month are part of the Year of Shattered Sanctuaries metaplot!</p> 
                   <p>Our first adventure takes the PCs to the port city of Sedeq in southern Qadira. The Pathfinder Society had previously sent a group of agents to take up residence in their brand new Sedeq lodge, but the agents never arrived!</p> 
                   <p>I’m extremely excited for you to learn what awaits the PCs when they go to investigate the lodge. I think GMs and players alike are going to enjoy the excellent mix of roleplaying, combat, puzzles, and memorable characters in this adventure.</p> 
                   <p>I hope you enjoy <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02akr?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-308-Foundations-Price"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-08: Foundation’s Price</em></a>, written by Letterio Mammoliti.

                   <p>In our second adventure for January, the PCs are part of an elite task force sent to the beleaguered and besieged Pathfinder lodge in Sothis, Osirion, known as the Sandswept Hall. Undead have been surging up from somewhere in the lodge’s basement, and it’s up to the PCs to undertake dangerous missions and strike back at the army of the dead. Seriously, if you asked me how many undead are in this adventure, I’d be hard pressed to come up with an answer. I lost count.</p> 
                   <p>There are <em>so many undead</em> in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02api?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-309-The-Secluded-Siege"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-09: The Secluded Siege</em></a>, written by Lysle Kapp. This adventure for levels 5–8 is the first scenario in a two-part metaplot arc taking place in Osirion.</p>

                   <p>This episode, the three questions I will ask are:</p> 
                   <ol> 
                    <li>What story does this product help tell?</li> 
                    <li>What rules does this product use most or what innovations does it bring to Pathfinder or Starfinder?</li> 
                    <li>Is there an insider or behind-the-scenes story of the product’s creation you would like to share? A challenge or joy you found?</li> 
                   </ol> 
                   <p>And then the conversation will unfold from there. In terms of images, we will showcase the final covers, tables of contents, and chapter header art. Finally, when signing off, I will ask each guest for a Paizo LIVE Spoiler. This can be about any announced future product!</p>

                  <blockquote> 
                   <p itemprop="description">For the second time today, Ciravel found herself exceedingly grateful for seatbelts and stabilizers.</p> 
                   <p>The first moment of gratitude was during Iseph's dizzying, looping, headlong dash toward Daimalko's surface—a flight where they showed both their skill at threading the space between the enormous meteoroids that surrounded the planet and their delight at making Ciravel shut her eyes despite herself. Ciravel ran and reran the possibilities in her mind, certain that this was the course that resulted in a safe arrival to a canyon on the planet's surface, and yet she still found herself clutching her armrests and putting <em>just enough</em> tension against the straps holding her in to make sure that they would, in fact, hold. </p> 
                   <p>The second moment came thanks to the radiation drake who clamped its crystalline jaws around her hoverchair and shook its head back and forth as if in virulent disagreement with Ciravel's very existence—an action which, without the negation of the stabilizers, would be excruciating, since the surface of this portion of Daimalko unexpectedly lacked many things, including plant life, water, and, much to the chagrin of Ciravel's various joints, consistent gravity. Iseph had anchored themself to one of the rocks which floated above the planet's surface and was locked in combat with a second drake.</p> 
                   <p>"You could have warned me—"</p> 
                   <p>"—about the radiation? The drakes? The battlefield ruins? The asteroids? Did you—oof!—notice the radiation buffers that you were so reluctant to—ow!—pick up this morning? 'But I don't breathe!' Honestly—your head would fall off if I didn't remind you to bring a wrench! YOU could have warned me that you fly like a drunken moldstorm!"</p> 
                   <p>"Can we discuss this when we're not—" Iseph ducked as their drake snapped its jaws shut, barely missing the android and a sending a soft crystalline ring echoing through the canyon, "—about to be turned into scrapyard bits?"</p> 
                   <p>Ciravel closed her eyes and focused her power, channeling it through her extended hand. The possibilities for the drake's next action unfolded before her like cards laid out on a table. She knew what she had to do.</p> 
                   <p>"Iseph, count to ten."</p> 
                   <p><em>Wait for it…</em></p> 
                   <p>"Ciravel, this hardly seems the ideal time for numerical calculation—"</p> 
                   <p>Ciravel shifted her weight, angling her chair slightly as the drake clamped its jaws higher, sending the pistol in her side holster careening toward the rocky ruins below. One more good bite and it would have her.</p> 
                   <p>…Wait…</p> 
                   <p>"…Make that seven."</p>

                    <h3>Illustration by Michele Giorgi from <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02aow?Starfinder-Galactic-Magic">Starfinder Galactic Magic</a></h3>
                   </div> 
                   <p>The drake's jaws opened momentarily as it repositioned its bite once more. In the precise moment where the drake's gullet was perfectly aligned, Ciravel turned her thrusters on full-force—right down the drake's throat. Its spine glowed with the intense blue flame before it gasped in pain and tumbled to the ground, releasing Ciravel's chair. Moments later, a rocky thud echoed through the canyon. </p> 
                   <p><em>Thank goodness for seat belts</em>, Ciravel thought once again as her chair careened wildly until the thrusters reoriented it. </p> 
                   <p>"Three…two…"</p> 
                   <p>She could see the drake's spine begin to glow again as it readied another beam. She was too far away. She needed more time.</p> 
                   <p>Ciravel blinked her eyes, holding the battlefield in stasis as she bolted toward Iseph. </p> 
                   <p>"…one."</p> 
                   <p>Iseph startled slightly at the voice that was suddenly right next to them. Ciravel grabbed the blaster pistol from Iseph's belt and winked. She lifted her chair up and away from Iseph, aiming the pistol directly at the drake, trying to catch its attention and spin it away from Iseph, exposing a heavily wounded flank to their blade. The drake turned, lifting its wing, preparing to follow Ciravel. This time, she looped time into a knot, immediately making the drake forget her presence and leaving it distracted long enough for Iseph to drive their searing blade directly into its wounded gut.</p> 
                   <p>She knew it would cost her later—the exhaustion from this last effort would be brutal—but Ciravel dug deep and twisted time once more, calibrating the trajectory and moment that Iseph's blade entered the drake's thorax, ensuring that it hit every vital organ it could on the way in. The drake collapsed and tumbled to the ground below.</p> 
                   <p>"My pistol?" Iseph outstretched their arm.</p> 
                   <p>"Ah, the 'thanks for saving my circuits, Ciravel' must be a different time thread…" Ciravel maneuvered back toward the rock where Iseph had themselves anchored and winced slightly in pain as she handed back the weapon, stretching her neck. "I think maybe <em>I'll</em> drive home? But let's get our repairs done quickly…I'm sure the Recollectors aren't too far behind us, if they aren't already here." </p> 
                   <p>"Ciravel, perhaps we have sailed the canal that was left."</p> 
                   <p>"The <em>left</em> canal, Iseph. The saying is that you've sailed down the <em>right</em> canal when things go to plan, or the <em>left</em> canal when you cannot locate what you need. But yes, it certainly looks like we might have sailed quite far down the left canal, unfortunately."</p>

                   </center> 
                   <p>She reached into one of the bags attached to the side of her hoverchair and pulled out a handle—which extended into a cane with a press of a button—and a tool kit, then released the safety belts attaching her to the chair. Activating the grav anchors on her boots and retracting the stabilizers, Ciravel stepped onto the hovering rock, and, leaning heavily on her cane, surveyed the damage to the chair. <em>Not too bad, considering the jaws</em>… </p> 
                   <p>Iseph pulled a medical kit from a belt pouch and began doing their own repairs to patch up their wounds—a cut here, a re-soldered circuit there. As Ciravel tightened bolts and reattached anything that had come loose from her chair in the fight, something gnawed at the back of her mind, but she brushed it away. The Recollectors were on their trail and they hadn't found any real clues to the cause of The Awakening, the cataclysm that decimated life on Daimalko. No hint to whether it was a natural event or an apocalyptic weapon used in the bitter war that used to rage on the planet. All Ciravel knew was that when she last held a fragment of rock that originated here, a specimen back in the xenobiology lab in Sovyrian, she tasted time—the only way she could describe the strange way that she suddenly smelled salt and citrus and tasted spiced honey whenever she encountered items from far in the past—a strange sensory activation that tied to her only childhood memory. A memory from the Gap. </p> 
                   <p>There hadn't been a whiff of anything other than sulfur and ozone since they arrived on Daimalko. But the way that rock had hummed in her ears…the song she had heard…what she'd heard…<em>what didn't I hear?</em></p> 
                   <p>"…Iseph, did you hear the impact of the second drake landing in the canyon?"</p> 
                   <p>"An impact? No…I heard an echo of jaws clashing and ringing, your weapon falling, the flames of your chair, the pistol firing, the screams…everything echoed back. But I did not hear a second impact of a drake on the canyon floor."</p> 
                   <p>In that moment, time unfolded for Ciravel as she registered three things. First: the air, which had reeked only of sulfur and centuries of decay, suddenly smelled of salt and citrus. The smell of Time, of the Gap. Second: the sudden darkness that fell when it had, only moments before, been glaringly bright. Night should have been nearly 30 hours away. And finally: the meaning of the absent sound of the drake's impact. Ciravel ran through the possibilities in a split second, and realization made her eyes go wide. </p> 
                   <p>"Um…Iseph?"</p> 
                   <p>"When I have finished repairing, Ciravel, I will assist you. It is already nightfall? We cannot waste our time tonight."</p> 
                   <p>"Iseph…look up. We'll make some extra time."</p> 
                   <p>The android glanced up from the wire they were reconnecting and then continued looking up, and up, and up the exoskeleton, watching in near-wonder as tendrils passed the drake corpse up…and up…and up…far higher than Ciravel's chair could reach on a day when it <em>hadn't</em> been rattled around in the jaws of a drake, past gargantuan claws and tusks.</p> 
                   <p>As her own eyes met the four beady ones of the Kyokor, Ciravel tasted spiced honey.</p> 
                   <p>She stared at the colossus, steadied herself back into her hoverchair, and activated the thrusters. She glided next to Iseph and looked over at them from beneath the creature's shadow, smiling.</p> 
                   <p>"Well, what do you know? Perhaps we sailed the right canal after all."</p>

                   <br> 
                   <h2>Digital Adventure Releases</h2> 
                   <p>Here are this month’s digital releases, available January 26, 2022:</p> 
                   <h3>Pathfinder</h3> 
                   <p><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02akr?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-308-Foundations-Price"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-08: Foundation's Price</em></a>*<br> <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02api?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-309-The-Secluded-Siege"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-09: The Secluded Siege</em></a>*</p> 
                   <h3>Starfinder</h3> 
                   <p><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02aom?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-413-Hard-Reset"><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #4-13: Hard Reset</em></a>*<br> <a href=""><em>Starfinder Bounty #1: The Cantina Job</em></a></p> 
                   <p><em>*part of a subscription</em></p> 
                   <h2>Convention Organizing Committees</h2> 
                   <p>As we begin to plan our 2022 conventions, we’re seeking individuals interested in joining the organizing committees for our major shows! If you’re interested in helping to plan PaizoCon, Gen Con, or PaizoCon Europe, head over to <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shwv?Call-for-Organizing-Committee-Volunteers">last week’s blog post</a> and submit an application. Applications close tomorrow (Friday, January 7), so don’t delay! We hope to release information soon about our plans for these shows and how to volunteer as a GM.</p> 
                   <h2>Starfinder Fame Update</h2> 
                   <p>As of last Friday, Starfinder Fame has officially expired. Any lingering Fame you haven’t spent yet is space dust in the wind; be sure to record your final purchases in your records.</p> 
                   <p>All boon conversion tasks should be completed at this time as well. The <a href="https://paizo.com/starfindersociety/faq">Starfinder Society FAQ</a> has been updated with the information on converting certain boons to Fame; please refer players to that page if they have questions.</p> 
                   <h2>Starfinder Nova Update</h2> 
                   <p>Last month, we announced that we would be adding <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq029u3?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-409-Through-Sea-and-Storm"><em>SFS #4-09: Through Sea and Storm</em></a> to the Nova qualification list; however, a paragraph was inadvertently omitted from the blog post. Rather than sneak it in, I decided to save it for this post and announce that <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01x4z"><em>SFS #1-39: The Herald’s War</em></a> will be retired from Nova qualification. As of <b>March 1, 2022</b>, any future runs of that scenario will not count as Specials for the purpose of Nova qualification. This grace period is intended to allow any GMs who had already been planning to run the scenario for credit to do so before we close the door. We don’t intend to retire any future scenarios from Nova qualification—this scenario was always a stopgap until we had enough scenarios in the requisite level ranges.</p> 
                   <h2>Sanctioning</h2> 
                   <p>With the office quiet for the holidays, we were able to take advantage of our lighter workloads and really blast through the outstanding sanctioning tasks! The following rulebooks and adventures have been <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/characteroptions">sanctioned for play</a> since last month: <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027u2"><em>Lost Omens Monsters of Myth</em></a>, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02ap2"><em>Absalom, City of Lost Omens</em></a>, the <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/strengthOfThousands"><em>Strength of Thousands</em></a> Adventure Path, and rules options from the <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/agentsOfEdgewatch"><em>Agents of Edgewatch</em> Adventure Path</a> (via the Achievement Points system). For Starfinder, we harnessed the power of the precog, and can announce that we have <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02aow?Starfinder-Galactic-Magic"><em>Galactic Magic</em></a> ready to go for its street date!</p> 
                   <p>We’ve also got some sanctioning in the pipeline that’s not quite ready yet, but watch the @PaizoOrgPlay Twitter feed for sanctioning announcements, or check back here next month.</p> 
                   <h2>GM Recognition</h2> 
                   <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the 5th milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios, as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains (program dependent). A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th milestone is 650 hours!</p> 
                   <p>This month, we had one GM earn their 5th Glyph for Pathfinder Society (second edition)!</p> 
                   <p><b>5th Glyph</b> - Tim Ayers</p> 
                   <p>Congratulations to our new 5-rank GM, and thank you for your dedication! If you believe you’ve achieved your 5th rank but haven’t been announced, email us at organizedplay@paizo.com.</p> 
                   <p>Until next time - Explore! Report! Cooperate! And enjoy the new year!</p>

                  <blockquote> 
                   <p itemprop="description">“You stand defeated, Voradni Voon!” Melika shouted, brandishing her tin sword at Elophos. The older actor bellowed, throwing his hands up in a defiant gesture meant to cover a quick tightening of the straps holding on his minotaur horns, which had begun to slide dangerously sideways.</p> 
                   <p>“Never!” Elophos cried, trotting back a few showy steps as he finished steadying his headgear. Horns secured, he charged forward again, thrusting his sword at Melika. “So long as he stands, Voradni Voon is not defeated!”</p> 
                   <p>“The earth has swallowed your army. Your centaurs are dead, your harpies scattered like frightened pigeons. Surrender!” Melika jabbed at Elophos’s midsection. The thrust was absurdly slow and clumsy—old Halvorash would have boxed her ears for signaling the lunge with her eyes and feet so long before she struck—but the flaws that would have doomed her in an alley fight were virtues on the stage. An audience wasn’t a footpad with a shank; you were <em>supposed</em> to help them see what was coming.</p> 
                   <p>“Voradni Voon will devour your heart and claim your godhood, puny human!” Elophos roared, swinging his stubby sword in broad arcs. Both actors’ weapons were shortened, letting them maximize the number of swings they could make before reaching each other onstage. Melika was impressed that Elophos managed to fit six full arcs in before he closed on her. He must have tweaked his pacing; he’d only ever managed five before.</p> 
                   <p>She dropped to one knee, exaggerating the height difference between them, and thrust upward, gripping her abbreviated sword’s hilt with both hands like a spear. Another absurdity for the stage, but it roused an anticipatory cheer from the audience, and then an expectant hush.</p> 
                   <p>Elophos didn’t disappoint them. Menacingly he stalked forward, having backed away in mock apprehension as Melika crouched. He charged straight onto the up-thrust point, then staggered back with a thunderous gasp, his sword arm pinwheeling in feigned death agonies. “Nooo!”</p> 
                   <p>“You would not stand defeated, Voradni Voon, so you must fall,” Melika intoned, striking a heroic pose, as Elophos crumpled slowly to the stage boards, clutching the blade “impaled” into his chest to keep it from falling.</p>

                    <h3>Illustration by Mirco Paganessi from <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02ap2?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Absalom-City-of-Lost-Omens"><em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Absalom, City of Lost Omens</em></a></h3>
                   </div> 
                   <br> 
                   <p>The audience burst into cheers. Elophos skipped back to his feet, handed Melika her sword, and shared a bow as the curtains came down. No sooner had the gold-fringed cloth dropped over them than they hopped down the back stairs, moving aside so the stage crew could clear their painted scenery and set up the next troupe’s props.</p> 
                   <p>Already, the painted wooden harpies and centaurs from <em>The Defeat of Voradni Voon</em> were being loaded onto wagons to be carted away for storage. They’d performed the act six times today, moving from stage to stage across Absalom, and now they were done. The sun was sinking westward, and night was soon to drop a final curtain on Foundation Day.</p> 
                   <p>It had been glorious—but now, already, Melika felt the warmth of the crowds and her own joy stealing away from her as swiftly as the fading light.</p> 
                   <p>Melika sighed. She pulled off the papier-mache crown and false mustache she’d worn as Aroden, unhooked the gaudy, gold-lined cape that she’d swirled through six victories over Voradni Voon, and folded them up, along with her dreams, inside the box that Elophos’s troupe would soon pack away.</p> 
                   <p>She wasn’t an actor, not really, not like the rest of them. Melika was just a serving girl. That morning, she’d been carrying a pitcher of wash water through the commons, just as the visiting troupe learned that their original Aroden was chained to her chamber pot following an encounter with a bad eel pie.</p> 
                   <p>As the actors were absorbing the bad news, one of the inn’s cats ran under Melika’s feet. She’d jumped, side-stepped, and recovered without spilling a drop. This impromptu demonstration led Elophos to conclude that she was strong and nimble enough to handle the fight choreography, about the right size to fit into Aroden’s costume, and therefore an adequate substitute for the show that they were contractually obligated to put onstage in two hours.</p> 
                   <p>“You’ll have ten lines,” he’d told her as he buckled the green-gold cape around her shoulders and pasted the horsehair mustache onto her face. “You can do it. Ten lines, and it doesn’t even matter if you get them wrong.”</p> 
                   <p>She hadn’t gotten them wrong. Six times she’d performed, each better than the last, as she learned to draw out the crowd and channel its energy into joy.</p> 
                   <p>And now it was over. Playing at the actor’s life had been fun, but Melika had siblings to feed and a sickly mother to tend. That painted crown wasn’t real gold, and it wouldn’t keep her family clothed.</p> 
                   <p>Heroism seemed so simple on stage. Maybe that was what people really liked to cheer, more than Aroden: the uncomplicated surety of right and wrong. The odds were stacked, the lines were scripted, and the heroes of legend never had anyone but themselves to think about. Their families were always conveniently faraway or dead—or at the very least, dependent on the same dramatic acts that the hero was already poised to commit.</p> 
                   <p>Heroes on a stage didn’t have to be quietly reliable for those they loved. Their bravado was just like their fighting: showy and false, with none of the dirt or desperation that grimed real struggle.</p> 
                   <p>Melika sighed. Though false, the dream was tempting. It surely was a pretty crown. And she’d probably never again touch cloth as fine as that cloak’s, stained and threadbare though it was.</p> 
                   <p>“You alright?” Elophos asked, vigorously toweling his sweat-matted hair. Six mock fights under the heavy, horned pelt of Voradni Voon had left him soaked.</p> 
                   <p>“I need to get back to work,” Melika told him.</p> 
                   <p>He counted out the money, then paused. “It’s Foundation Day. You don’t have the day off to celebrate?”</p> 
                   <p>“Someone has to work for other people to celebrate,” Melika pointed out, dryly, but only after she’d pocketed the coin. You didn’t talk back before you got their money. “You didn’t think all those mugs of beer poured or washed themselves, did you?” It occurred to her that maybe he <em>did</em> think that. Nobody had ever said that actors were overburdened with good sense.</p> 
                   <p>Elophos just shrugged. “But it’s Foundation Day.”</p> 
                   <p>“It is. So I should get back. They’ll need me.”</p> 
                   <p>“You could stay with us. Be an actor. You’re a natural on stage.”</p> 
                   <p>“For less than what I earn now?” Melika snorted. She’d worked hard for that inn job. Decent pay, extra food, sometimes clothes or even boots that drunk patrons left behind. If Elophos had ever been half as cold and hungry as she’d been before the inn, he would know what it meant to give that up.</p> 
                   <p>“It might not be less. Not for long.” His speculative look was greedy enough that she almost believed him. “You’ve got talent.”</p> 
                   <p>“Talent and a houseful of hungry siblings. Guess which one yells louder.”</p> 
                   <p>“Well, think about it.” Elophos tossed the towel over his shoulder. “A lot of us will be headed to the Wounded Wisp after sundown, if you think you can get away from washing those beer mugs for a bit. Talk to some people. Make some friends. Perhaps you’ll see that the stage pays well enough to keep a houseful of hungry siblings fed.”</p> 
                   <p>“Maybe.” Melika walked away, through the thronging crowds of revelers, other people’s joy and laughter scattered around her like flower petals. She didn’t begrudge their happiness. It meant good tips.</p> 
                   <p>And as she walked, she turned Elophos’s suggestion around and around, like a coin in her pocket she was debating how to spend. Maybe she did have talent. Maybe she could feed her family that way. Maybe it wasn’t stupid to spend an hour finding out.</p> 
                   <p>The Wounded Wisp...</p>

                   <p>The technomancer and witchwarper debated the differences between their respective talents while perusing the port’s open-air markets. </p> 
                   <p>“Our methods differ only in scope. You use your gifts to push technology,” said Zemir, tossing another faulty circuit board into a display case, “whereas I use mine to push reality.”</p> 
                   <p>“Your scope may be wider,” said Raia, examining some drive schematics absently. “But my tech produces more reliable results.”</p> 
                   <p>“Reliability is irrelevant. In the end, we seek the same thing—the new, impossible, the interesting. Is how we do it so important?”</p> 
                   <p>“Some would say the ‘how’ is the most important part of all,” Raia answered, smiling. It was an old debate between friends, one they’d cheerfully had over drinks in many a space port. </p> 
                   <p>“Perhaps you’re right,” said Zemir quietly. Raia recognized that faraway look. One day she’d learn the cause of Zemir’s periodic melancholy. </p> 
                   <p>Before Zemir could say more, the market fell eerily silent. Everyone around them stared upward. Zemir and Raia joined them, and watched as the moon eclipsed the sun, and all went dark.</p> 
                   <p>Soon after, the chittering squeaks and clicks began.</p> 
                   <p>“I recognize those sounds,” said Raia. “Grioths.”</p> 
                   <p>“What, this far in Near Space?” asked Zemir. </p> 
                   <p>“They get closer every year,” said Raia sadly. She found grioths a fascinating formation of life. It’s too bad so many of them were in the monstrous grip of Nyarlathotep, for their voidglass technology and biology was quite interesting and could be put to great use in the Pact Worlds.</p> 
                   <p>Her thoughts were interrupted by holes opening in the moon-eclipsed sky. From these shadowy portals descended a wave of winged terrors. The grioths’ silhouettes looked like thousands of bats with arms and legs—all of which held glittering weaponry.</p> 
                   <p>The technomancer and the witchwarper watched the marketgoers flee. In silent agreement, both stood still amid the chaos, knowing they could hold off the grioths and allow these citizens to get to safety. </p> 
                   <p>Several grioth raiders noticed the two holding their ground and broke off to attack them. Raia picked off one with a single blaster pulse while Zemir stared at another and muttered. Suddenly, the grioth’s wing seized and it plummeted to the ground. That left three more, who charged in a whirl of chittering squeaks and gleaming, deadly glass. </p> 
                   <p>A fourth landed in front of Raia and swiped at her with its giant, clawed hand.</p> 
                   <p>“No,” said Raia calmly, stepping back and raising her hands. She felt composed, as though in a simulation. She had spent the better part of the afternoon familiarizing herself with the tech around her, and now she simply had to put it to work, albeit for a new purpose.</p> 
                   <p>As the grioth tried to grasp her again, she cast a spell with a word and a gesture. Behind her, the vast engine powering the veranda block rumbled and cracked. Suddenly, as though it were a puppet pulled by the technomancer’s strings, it unleashed from its casing and wrapped the grioth in an unbreakable embrace of steel and coiled wire.</p> 
                   <p>Zemir watched his friend fight and wondered how best to aid her in the dance. He was no slouch with a blade, but with so many opponents, more help was needed. </p> 
                   <p>What if, perhaps, another portal opened? One to a world filled with bright sunlight? Zemir pondered the possibilities and adjusted probabilities as though inputting calculations into the ultimately unknowable machine that was the universe. Calculations that, due to his training at the institute, he sometimes knew the outcomes for.</p> 
                   <p>A bright portal to a sun-filled world opened, a world with—yes, perfect—a swarm of apari constituents, who poured from the portal, angry and hungry. The grioths shrieked at the light, some clutching their faces as its very photons pierced their psychic defenses. At Zemir’s direction, the apari swarm crashed against the grioths like a wave, instinctively trying to strike back against invaders who would darken a world. </p>

                   <br> 
                   <p>“You will all perish for the glory of our dark master,” whispered one of grioth invaders with a harsh rasp. Before he could say more, he was overwhelmed by the swarm of apari.</p> 
                   <p>He could have run—but he wouldn’t. Helping Raia made it worth it; knowing that, in some small way, Zemir had adjusted his account, paying back what he’d done wrong. He might never be able to atone for leaving his friends in that other reality, might never be able to get them back (though another part of him still wondered about this) but here, now, at least he and his friend Raia could save each other. </p> 
                   <p>Together, weaving reality and technology with threads of magic, the technomancer and witchwarper beat back the remaining two grioth attackers, their martial prowess no match for the pair’s magical mastery. </p> 
                   <p>“We have to get to the ship,” said Zemir once they had a moment to catch their breath. “I can open a gateway there, but I’ve expended a lot of power and can only take myself.”</p> 
                   <p>“Go. I know you won’t leave me behind,” said Raia. For some reason, Zemir looked inexplicably sad at that.</p> 
                   <p>“I will come back for you,” Zemir promised gravely. He stepped through the portal and was gone. </p> 
                   <p>Raia waited, holding glowing sigils and technical weapons in the dark marketplace. From the chittering and squeaks, she knew another squad of grioths was inbound. With all the tech around her, Raia knew she could hold them off, but not indefinitely. She just hoped that Zemir would get back with the ship in time. </p>

                   <p>It will probably come as a surprise to no one that my biggest sci-fi influences are largely comedic. I mean, when faced with yawning infinite void of space, you just have to laugh, right? For me, it probably started with <em>The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy</em> in all its forms: books, radio play, text adventure, BBC series, and eventually, major motion picture. There’s something so relatable about a hapless Earthling being thrust into a galactic adventure of stolen spaceships, time travel, and bureaucracy. From there, I would find Space Quest (featuring the first space janitor?), <em>Red Dwarf </em>(“Everybody’s. Dead. Dave.”), <em>Callahan’s Crosstime Saloon</em> (though that series is more a vehicle for puns than anything else), and Futurama (best math jokes in the biz!). The goofier episodes of <em>The X-Files</em> and <em>Farscape</em> are among my favorite. More recently, <em>Galaxy Quest</em> and <em>Lower Decks</em> have taken their shots at that most venerable of sci-fi institutions, Star Trek. Much of comedic sci-fi lovingly pokes fun at its own genre or points at the foibles of the present through a sci-fi lens. And that’s the kind of influence I try to bring to Starfinder when appropriate. Our iconic biohacker hosts a family-friendly science-oriented vidshow that often leads to more danger than it should. A group of skittermanders rescue their vesk boss from a dangerous massage machine. I love adding those sorts of touches, and I hope you enjoy them too! I can’t wait for you to see what’s next!</p>

                   <p>My dad got me into science fiction at an early age, with Heinlein’s <em>Rocket Ship Galileo</em>. Heinlein wrote a YA science fiction novel every year, just in time for Christmas. It was a smart strategy. I don’t know how many of those books I read: <em>Have Spacesuit Will Travel</em>, <em>The Star Beast</em>, <em>The Moon is a Harsh Mistress</em>. In high school, I had my first actual class on science fiction, which introduced me to everything from Asimov and John Carter to <em>Riverworld</em> and Chalker’s <em>Well of Souls</em>; predictably, my final project was a Well of Souls wargame I designed myself. In fact, by this point, my science fiction intake was starting to be determined as much by games as by novels; I spent my rainy days pouring over <em>Traveler’s Imperium</em>, rolling random mutations in <em>Gamma World</em>, and playing <em>Star Fleet Battles</em>. When I got to college, I wandered the campus bookstore looking for stuff I’d never heard of before, and that got me to Phil Dick’s <em>Man in the High Castle</em> and the <em>Mirrorshades</em> anthology, which broke open the cyberpunk genre. It took me a couple of tries to figure out Dune. As a graduate student, I studied science fiction under the great and much-missed Dr. George Slusser, curator of the University of California Riverside’s Eaton Collection, one of the largest collections of SF in the world. One day, on my way out of class, I told Slusser, “You know, I want your job.” He said to me, “Stick around here long enough, you might get it.” When he passed in 2014, I applied for that gig. I didn’t get it, but no regrets. Now, I get to make science fiction instead of curate it, and some of the things I’ve made are on the shelves of the Eaton Collection. I’ll take that deal.</p>

                   <p>We’re standing next to each other at a convention. It’s loud and crowded here in the dealer hall, but we’ve identified one another as fellow sci-fi nerds; the awkward serendipity when two weirdos recognize each other in the wild. We’ve been existing in a pandemic for two years at this point so we desperately want to chat with someone new, so we’re eager to start a conversation. Our hobby is our common ground, so we start talking about favorite works of sci-fi. You list the various novels, video games, and films that first connected you to a network of other minds imagining extraordinary realities. I tell you I’m inspired by the works of Yoko Taro, Octavia Butler, Toni Morrison, Tade Thompson, and the Strugatsky brothers. Then you ask one of those classic icebreaker questions: Which Star Trek is your favorite?</p>

                   <p>I shrug. I’m not really into Star Trek, but I watched some with my parents growing up. (Star Wars’ western vibe was always more my jam, but my dad’s a certified trekkie.) So I tell you that my favorite is Voyager. Why? You ask. You’re correctly assuming Captain Janeway has something to do with it. We rewind to my childhood. When my parents began watching Voyager, I was an awkward girl with scabbed knees and an unflattering bowl cut. During the show’s run, I transformed from invisible tomboy to sullen preteen. I hated my body and wasn’t comfortable with the changes puberty was enforcing on it. I didn’t agree with everything I saw in the world around me. I was powerless to change anything and waiting for my real life to begin. Enter Seven of Nine, a badass with a crisp Federation uniform and stylish pixie cut. She was everything I dreamed of becoming. In her, I saw the future.</p> 
                   <p>But she was more than a childhood role model for me. Even though I never watched the entire series, Seven’s narrative first sparked my interest in telling stories that explore the definition of humanity and the nature of the soul. She was concrete evidence of a feminine person driving her own narrative. And there were others like her. Ripley, Sarah Connor, General Leia, and (much later) Furiosa became favorite characters and visions of powerful femininity, canonized as goddesses in a new pantheon. I expect that of all my space heroines, Seven of Nine had the deepest influence on me. </p> 
                   <p>Now, imagine yourself back in the convention hall. You listen politely to my explanation and we gush about our favorite sci-fi characters for few more minutes. I ask you another question, maybe about video games, and the ice is broken. We chat for a while. We say goodbye and head off to our next destinations, happy to have met and befriended a fellow nerd.</p> 
                   <p>But, I digress. This is a blog about sci-fi in general, not “POV: you meet me at a convention.” Sci-fi works have had such an influence on my life, and it’s pretty amazing to be able to call myself a sci-fi creator now. When experiencing sci-fi, we can dream of other worlds near and far. We can hope for a bright solarpunk future and try to write it into being, or examine the great conflicts of our own lives, our fears, our struggles, through a lens that allows others to understand us better. Thanks to all of you for your interest in other worlds, and expect the aliens, philosophical machines, mechs, and space shenanigans to continue. </p>

                   <p>When I look back at this year, I think the theme is resilience through uncertainty. Between shipping crises (remember when the boat was stuck? good times!), the ongoing pandemic, and shakeups at Paizo, this year has been tumultuous, to say the least. But this is the best community out there, and you all have rolled with the punches, adapted to the new terrain, and kept playing with us. I can’t thank you all enough for everything, and I can’t wait to see you all in 2022.</p> 
                   <p>Before I leave you, I have a message from Mike Kimmel to share.</p> 
                   <hr width="50%"> 
                   <p>Hey everyone! The end of the calendar year also marks the end of my first year on the Organized Play team. It’s been a year filled with challenges, rewards, and adventures. One of my fondest memories of the year was being able to write my first adventure outline for Paizo, which led to a little bounty called Hillcross Roundup. I’m looking forward to outlining and developing more adventures and tackling more challenges in the months ahead. Later this year, we’ll be wrapping up the Year of Shattered Sanctuaries and jumping into Year 4. I can’t wait to share these exciting adventures with you! I hope I’ll have opportunities to meet and interact with more members of the community in 2022, whether that’s online, in person, or both. I want to hear all about your adventures!</p> 
                   <hr width="50%"> 
                   <p>Stay safe and warm, and until next time - Explore! Report! Cooperate! And we’ll see you in 2022!</p>

                  <blockquote> 
                   <p itemprop="description">“A new game?” Kesara asked, her old Vudrani hands already sweeping the drouge pieces off the embroidered cloth, milk-pale jade and black onyx figurines vanishing like magician’s coins between her bony fingers.</p> 
                   <p>Guan Kai shrugged, smiling, and uncapped his flask of blackdream liqueur. He waved it at Kesara, chuckling when she wrinkled her nose in disgust at the offer, as she always did. Unoffended, Guan Kai sipped the murky, anise-scented drink. “What choice do I have? You’ve cleared the board. Just when I was winning, too.”</p> 
                   <p>“There was no winning that game.” Kesara dealt new pieces onto the cloth with the swift flourishes of a professional gambler, which Guan Kai supposed she was, after a fashion. “This one will be better. New pieces, new board. Very friendly.” With a motion, Kesara substituted the black jackals from the original set with a pair of lions from her near-inexhaustible supply of alternate pieces. Playfully, she set two pennies carefully on the lions’ heads like little copper crowns, then spun them with a flick of her fingertips. The metal disks twirled momentarily atop the figures before clattering dully onto the cloth.</p> 
                   <p><em>So</em>, Guan Kai thought, <em>she wants to bargain a secret about some instability in Taldor.</em></p> 
                   <p>“Speaking of friends,” Kesara asked casually, “do you still have yours in the Chrysanthemum Court?”</p> 
                   <p>Guan Kai took another pull from his flask. “Naturally. A man as old as I either has no friends, or too many to count. One’s habits add up to the sum of one’s life, as the sages say.”</p> 
                   <div class="blurbCenter">

                    <h3>Illustration by Mirco Paganessi from <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02ap2?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Absalom-City-of-Lost-Omens"><em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Absalom, City of Lost Omens.</em></a></h3>
                   </div> 
                   <br> 
                   <p>“Do they? I wouldn’t know. I’m a dewy spring blossom, myself.” Kesara’s eyes vanished into her wrinkles when she laughed. She plucked the white jade elephants from the board and made a show of hesitating before she replaced them. “Now which of my little pieces would best serve your side? I presume, after a lifetime’s likeability, you could name 16 close friends in the Court?”</p> 
                   <p>She was feeling him out, trying to see which of the Successor States of Lung Wa might offer the best price for her information. Guan Kai pretended to ignore the bait. It was ridiculous for him to offer anything; Kesara hadn’t even hinted what secret she was trying to sell. How could he know who wanted it? “I’m an easy man to like. Even in Shenmen, I might find a few friends.”</p> 
                   <p>“Oh, no, not Shenmen. Just the name of that haunted place gives me chills.”</p> 
                   <p>“No need to worry. It’s very far from here.” Information about the Imperial Court of Taldor was unlikely to be of value to the Successor States, he meant.</p> 
                   <p>“The Court isn’t far at all.” Kesara lifted her chin, nodding to the high white tower of the Starstone Cathedral behind them. “Just on the other side of that great gaudy sundial.”</p> 
                   <p>Ah, so her secret wasn’t being dangled for the Successor States themselves, but for their envoys. The Chrysanthemum Court was the unofficial embassy for dignitaries from all the many kingdoms of Tian Xia. Business that was too risky or sordid to pass through diplomatic channels often wound up there.</p> 
                   <p>This game had suddenly become more interesting. Guan Kai took another sip from his flask, then capped it with a flourish and set it aside. His blood was warm enough without the liquor. “I can hardly choose a piece without seeing the sample available for selection.”</p> 
                   <p>“I suppose that’s fair.” Rather than offering him a choice of white pieces, however, Kesara plucked an onyx boar from her case and set it between the lions. It was an ugly, pugnacious thing, its glittering tusks thrust out in belligerent menace.</p> 
                   <p>Baronet Ghazolain. His family crest carried a boar against crossed spears, and he’d recently arrived in Absalom as part of the Taldan diplomatic delegation. Scarcely a month had passed since the baronet arrived in the City at the Center of the World, yet already foul rumors followed him. Tales abounded of stained altars covered in clandestine artifacts, inhuman chants and cries from his quarters at night, and grim-faced servants who nursed unexplained wounds and then disappeared altogether.</p> 
                   <p>Or so people said. Guan Kai had learned to dismiss most such rumors—they were true only rarely, and useful even less. But now, it made sense why Kesara was angling for a buyer from the Successor States: the baronet was also said to be urgently litigating some kind of family claim in Amanadar, a former Taldan colony now counted among the 16 Successor States of Lung Wa.</p> 
                   <p>“Interesting,” Guan Kai said. “I would have thought the boar should go on my side.”</p> 
                   <p>“I assure you, the boar is opposed to any piece you might choose,” Kesara said. Her rheumy eyes were sharp and intense beneath their clouds of age as she split her fingers into a triangle around the boar’s head. An old sign, from when they’d first played at spycraft, as children.</p> 
                   <p><em>Danger</em>. Danger that would seize your throat and twist your head off without trying.</p> 
                   <p>Guan Kai smiled. “Really? Fascinating. Then I shall choose a devil, for a beast so fearsome deserves an equally formidable foe.” He’d kept his answer malleable on purpose. The devil could certainly represent Chu Ye, ruled by oni, but it could just as easily mean Cheliax. The Western devil-binders were always willing to pay for dangerous secrets, even those that didn’t concern them.</p> 
                   <p>Kesara shook her head. Her gaze lingered on a pair of dogs pulling a wagon in the street. The animals greeted one another cheerfully, interrupting their own work to wag tails and exchange sniffs. “Look there, behind you. Some creatures understand the value of loyalty. Some people, too. I said this should be a friendly game—you’d be well advised to keep only true friends on your board, and fiends are never that. But, of course, you’re free to choose the pieces that suit your strategy. I can only make suggestions.”</p> 
                   <p><em>Ah, so</em>. Guan Kai felt peculiarly warmed by Kesara’s warning. Seventy years they’d played the game together, though she owed him no favors. They’d been rivals as often as allies, and each had betrayed the other far too many times for any attempt at tallying to be worthwhile.</p> 
                   <p>Still, in this, she warned him. This information was too explosive to be entrusted to treacherous hands.</p> 
                   <p>And now he understood. Kesara didn’t want to sell her secret after all. She wanted help. Baronet Ghazolain was involved in something so terrible that the 10,000 whisperers of Jalmeray were reaching out to Guan Kai, and his friends, for aid. And they were sending that request as secretly as they knew how, lest the baronet’s spies catch a whisper of their plea.</p> 
                   <p>“Very well,” Guan Kai said. “I choose the dragon and the rat.”</p> 
                   <p>Kesara nodded. A tiny knot of tension softened in her shoulders. <em>She must be terrified</em>, Guan Kai thought, <em>if her worry shows so plainly</em>.</p> 
                   <p>But Kesara had spent 70 years learning to control such fear, and her voice was calm as aloe. “Let our game begin.”</p>

                   <h3>Dana Ebert</h3> 
                   <p>Hi there! It's Dana Ebert (she/her), and I'm so excited to be back so soon! In <em>Monsters of Myth</em>, I took on Desert's Howl, which first appeared in <em>Mythical Monsters Revisited</em> almost ten years ago. This version expands on Jalari's story, while reimagining Desert's Howl as a unique monster with brand new lore and abilities for Second Edition.</p> 
                   <p>I honestly adore the final stat block for Desert's Howl. I conceptualized its abilities with the intent of using mechanics to convey the feeling of being hunted and toyed with, and this version is simply vicious at denying the player characters rest and recovery in between encounters with the creature. With the release of this book, I hope that there'll be a few more Desert's Howl fans in the future!</p> 
                   <p>As always, thank you so much for reading and making this community such a wonderful place! If you use Desert's Howl or any of its lore in your campaign (I'm very fond of Jalari's treasure coins, myself), I would love to hear about it on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/MistressDanaRPG">https://twitter.com/MistressDanaRPG</a>). And if you ever want to know more about what I'm currently working on, you can find that information on my Linktree (<a href="https://linktr.ee/MistressDanaRPG">https://linktr.ee/MistressDanaRPG</a>).</p>

                   <p>Hello, readers and greetings from Sen.H.H.S., your freelancer who lives across the Pacific Ocean from North America. You may have seen me around in projects such as Bestiary 3, Ruby Phoenix's Goka Gazetteer, <em>Secret of Magic</em>, and many other publications. For <em>Monsters of Myth</em>, I wrote the kaijus. When this assignment first came down, I was internally screaming because my gods, the pressure to deliver! Just how am I going to do these gigantic walking natural or supernatural disasters justice? After copious amounts of kaiju wikia consumption and kaiju movie clips (Pacific Rim is the best movie ever!) I hope the end result is as awe-inspiring (or horror-inspiring) as intended. If you’re interested in knowing what I'm up to recently in the TTRPG sphere, follow me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/SenHHS">@SenHHS</a> where I bemoan how my current reading list of forensic textbooks is raising eyebrows. </p>

                   <p>Hello! I’m Aaron, and I wrote and designed rules for two sections in <em>Monsters of Myth</em>: Kuworsys and Somnalu. I had an absolute blast working on both of them, as I did a bit of research and reading of epic myth to prepare (a quick recommendation: <em>The Epic of Gilgamesh</em> is a genuinely incredible read). I’m fascinated by how myths are remembered, and how interpretations and treatments of myth change over time. I hope my sections even encourage players to do a bit of that themselves.</p> 
                   <p>With Kuworsys, I had the opportunity to craft a new story around a pre-existing location, and with Somnalu, I got to contribute to the story of a legendary figure from Pathfinder’s past. I’m very excited for players to explore the ever-shifting ruins of Kuworsys’s labyrinth and to descend into the depths to confront slithering Somnalu.</p> 
                   <p>If you’re interested, you can find me on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/devlascano">@devlascano</a>. I make narrative-focused TTRPGs on Itch and I do freelance work on games whenever an opportunity arises. Cheers! </p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Andrew Mullen</h3> 
                   <p>Howdy! I’m Andrew Mullen, writer of xulgaths and quite a few other monsters at this point. For this project, I worked alongside Josh Kim and Liane Merciel. Josh wrote Kothogaz’s lore, and turning that into rules was an exciting challenge. I wanted a big, campaign-ending abomination to have more ‘breadth’ in the story than just the confrontation where you hope to kill it. For the Melfesh Monster, I just got to read through Liane’s fantastic work and pluck out tidbits to turn into monster abilities—she gave me a ton to work with!</p> 
                   <p>Beyond my co-authors, I want to give a special thanks to my cousin Sameer Gupta. He’s a talented musician who focuses on American jazz and Indian classical music. Given Kothogaz’s ties to Vudra, it was important that I do right by any real-world Indian cultural aspects I used for inspiration. Without Sameer, the Craft Disharmonic Instrument and Raga of Remembrance sections wouldn’t be nearly as flavorful, interesting, or accurate. You can check him out <a href="https://sameergupta.com/press-quotes-artist-bio/">on his website</a>, and across social media as <a href="https://twitter.com/tablajazz">@tablajazz</a>. I also highly recommend his album “A Circle Has No Beginning”—it’s gotten me through a lot of late night deadline pushes!</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Shay Snow</h3> 
                   <p>Hi, I'm Shay Snow (they/them), I'm an editor at Paizo, and I wrote up the Kallas Devil and partnered with the extremely talented Liane Merciel to stat up Ulgrem-Axaan! I hope my skipping rhyme and lovely letters bring you lots of shivers, and I hope you enjoy all of the neat things that both the Kallas Devil and Ulgrem-Axaan can do for your games! You may have seen me in <em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Grand Bazaar</em> and <em>Secrets of Magic</em>, and I have a few things coming out in <em>Galactic Magic</em>. Additionally, you can find my name on a few Coyote &amp; Crow projects!</p> 
                   <p>When not writing, I’m usually discussing Native issues and rights over on my Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/spellsinsugar">@SpellsInSugar</a>, where you can also sometimes catch me talking about video games and horror media. You can keep up with my work, or even contact me for hire, through my website <a href="https://shayjay.carrd.co/">https://shayjay.carrd.co/</a>!</p>

                   <h3>Soup</h3> 
                   <p>"Heya, I’m Soup! I’m a nonbinary Korean-American freelance writer/game designer/podcaster/streamer. I love nothing more than cool new angles on classic fantasy tropes. I’m really excited for this book because I got to draw from Korean mythology and tradition to bring you the Taljjae, a creature inspired by the real-life mask dancing of Korea, and hopefully a cool addition to your games. You can find me streaming video games here (<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/literalsoup">https://www.twitch.tv/literalsoup</a>), my work here (<a href="https://literalsoup.com/">https://literalsoup.com/</a>), listen to my podcast here (<a href="http://absoluteterritorycast.com/">http://absoluteterritorycast.com/</a>), or contact me about business inquiries at literalsoup@gmail.com." </p>

                   <h3>Jake Tondro</h3> 
                   <p>From a tall tower of ivory Tondro arose,<br> Where tales of Tolkien and Arthur he’d told.<br> But he exited, hexed, a man in exile,<br> To get a gamer’s refuge working for golems.<br> Then in plague, a plentiful pestilence,<br> Luis and Eleanor, developers at large,<br> Boldly offered a boon to the bairn.<br> “Fafnheir,” they said first, “of linnorms the father<br> “And Grogrisant, greedy for imperial guts<br> “Belong in this book, do not betray us!”<br> This task Tondro gladly took up<br> And laboring long in darkness and light<br> He sang the six-eyed lion’s song<br> And wove a wyrm from stubborn words.</p>

                   <p>For the last three holiday seasons, VC Nicholas Ruchlewicz has organized charity events for his local lodge to help others. The Toys for Tots program is a wonderful way to get into the holiday spirit and help those in need! </p> 
                   <p>This year, the charity event expanded from a single local lodge in Fairfax to multiple REGIONS! Obviously, during covid time, everyone has become more flexible with hybrid events—so this event had a physical presence organized by Northern Virginia Venture Captain Nicholas and Baltimore Venture Lieutenant Nathan, plus online offerings including VOs from other lodges a bit further from the DC area. This year, the VOs directly engaged our Friendly Local Game Stores (FLGS). We have all been through difficult times with the pandemic, including many of the small businesses that support our players in a safe, welcoming environment. The community was able to support the amazing charity by purchasing toys and books at the FLGS and immediately donating them to the onsite Toys for Tots boxes.</p> 
                   <p>On 12/11/2021, Pathfinders participated in interactive special PF2 #3-99 Fate in the Future at the Cayden’s Keg convention. This charity event added 7 physical tables to the 19 online tables! In addition to the physical toy donations, the raffle ticket sales provided an additional $1320+ donation to the cause. </p> 
                   <p>Below are the locations and Venture officers in each FLGS! If you are ever near one of our lodges, please visit their business—we can’t thank our community enough! </p>

The older man didn’t seem aware of the dark shapes stalking him, first from a distance, then closer, along his path.

                   <p>“Shouldn’t have gotten involved in War Hounder business, old man. We don’t like folks asking questions about our dealings!”</p> 
                   <p><em>“Well,</em>” Ezren thought to himself, “<em>it’s about time</em>.”</p> 
                   <p>Though confident in his preparations, the wizard still summoned some basic defenses as the War Hounders cautiously approached. A mage’s armor was, in his opinion, properly made of magic. He layered a <em>shield</em> spell atop it for good measure.</p> 
                   <p>One of the ruffians flung a dagger at Ezren as the rest moved to cut off his escape routes… which he had no intention of taking.</p> 
                   <p>“I’ve been trying to get your attention for some time,” Ezren said calmly as the knife bounced off his arcane shield. Unsurprisingly, the War Hounders ignored him. Ezren knew they were aware of his wizardly training and understood their desire to take him out quickly. If this had been a remotely fair fight, they’d be doing the right thing. </p> 
                   <p>Ezren did his best to avoid “fair” fights, though. A fair fight was the result of poor research, and he prided himself on his scholarship.</p> 
                   <p>His two fastest attackers were a scarred human and a dwarf; each wielding sword and dagger. Ezren reviewed a range of possible replies before settling on a simple lightning cantrip. Not fully powered, something in the mid-range he knew they’d survive. He wanted to deliver a message and getting the dead to deliver messages was more… problematic.</p> 
                   <p>Ezren concentrated on the essence of lightning as he performed word and gesture to express that essence. Electricity jolted from his open hand, arcing first to the human and then the dwarf. Neither was quick enough to avoid his spell. The dwarf fell to the ground, flopping about like a fish trapped in a tide pool. The human grunted and raised his sword… as Merisiel’s thrown dagger buried itself in the back of his skull.</p> 
                   <p>Ezren was not so foolish as to provoke a guild of thieves without backup, and it was gratifying to see the remaining War Hounders look stunned at Merisiel’s dramatic entrance. A moment later, it was Ezren’s turn to be surprised as a fifth War Hounder, a cloaked woman with two long daggers, launched herself between Merisiel and the fallen dwarf.</p> 
                   <p>The situation was still in hand… for now.</p>

                   </div> 
                   <br> 
                   <p>“I know you can’t answer my questions.” Ezren’s sounded calm as he turned in place, his cane held high to ward off the two-handed sword blow from the War Hounder who’d been trying to sneak up behind him. “But when you flee back to the Pyramid of the Dog, I want you to deliver your master a message.”</p> 
                   <p>The cloaked woman began dragging the dwarf’s twitching body back into the shadows, tiny sparks of electricity continuing to bound off him across the worn road’s shallow puddles. The attacker with the greatsword swung it again, trying to cut Ezren in half with an attack powerful enough to force the wizard to expend his arcane shield to counter it. Merisiel threw another dagger into an apparently empty space… and the empty space grunted and spattered blood on the street.</p> 
                   <p>“I’d have sent a courier requesting an audience, but none seemed willing to deliver my message, and I haven’t had any luck with public notices.”</p> 
                   <p>Ezren formed a new eldritch concept in his mind, and colors sprayed out from his cane, hitting the greatsword-wielder full in the face. The attacker’s eyes took on the same rainbow colors, and the scoundrel dropped his sword as he staggered away unsteadily. The cloaked woman finished dragging her fallen comrade out of sight, and Merisiel positioned herself to watch his back.</p> 
                   <p>Ezren turned slowly, scanning the open square. The blinded War Hounder was wandering aimlessly but could become a threat again within a minute or so. The woman and dwarf were out of sight but could potentially be maneuvering to make another assault. Merisiel would warn him if that were to happen. There was another man…</p> 
                   <p>At the edge of the square, a man clad in brown and green lurked in the shadows. His drab clothing actually blended into the backdrop of Absalom’s Puddles District better than the pure black of his compatriots. He was bald with a full beard. He studied Ezren with a stern expression, single dagger in hand, though he was well out of stabbing range. The War Hounder could, of course, throw his blade. Or perhaps he knew some occult secret with which to blast Ezren’s mind. </p> 
                   <p>Trusting Merisiel to handle any other unforeseen threats from behind, Ezren turned to face the bald man.</p> 
                   <p>“You are, I take it, in charge?”</p> 
                   <p>The bald man waved a hand in casual denial. “I wouldn’t say that. We aren’t strict in terms of rank or command, you see? More accurate to say I’m wise enough not to be on the front line when confronting a wizard of your… reputation.”</p> 
                   <p>Ezren nodded in acknowledgment, though he suspected the bald man had no idea who he was or what reputation he might possess. </p> 
                   <p>“May I assume,” asked Ezren, eyes still scanning for the missing dwarf, “that if I were to ask you to carry a message to the oldest and wisest of the War Hounders, you could see that it was received?”</p> 
                   <p>“I’d be delighted.” The bald man looked anything but delighted, but Ezren believed his message would be delivered.</p> 
                   <p>As Ezren was about to reply, the War Hounder who’d dropped the greatsword snapped out of his befuddlement. He looked back and forth between the wizard and the bald man. Merisiel was nowhere to be seen, but Ezren knew she was nearby. He kicked the dropped greatsword toward his assailant who, upon receiving a nod from the bald man, picked up his weapon and rushed to stand beside his ally.</p> 
                   <p>“I would <em>very</em> much like to know,” said Ezren with as much iron as he could put in his voice, “what became of the papers and effects of Nessian. Further, I represent a buyer who would pay well for them, if they remain in War Hounder possession.”</p> 
                   <p>The bald man tried to look impassive, but his eyes showed a hint of surprise. Then he nodded again, and gestured for the larger warrior to head out of the courtyard.</p> 
                   <p>“I assure you, that message shall be delivered.” </p> 
                   <p>And with that he followed after the taller man, both of whom were quickly enveloped by shadows.</p> 
                   <p>Ezren smiled as he headed back toward the inn he was staying at in the Foreign Quarter. He made sure to walk slowly so he could easily be followed, trusting Merisiel to prevent further assaults. He suspected when the War Hounders attacked him again tonight, they’d bring someone who could answer his questions.</p> 
                   <p>And tonight at the inn, he and Merisiel wouldn’t be alone to receive them.</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">Ciravel’s first—and only—childhood memory is of tasting the stars. Peering through a window into the depths of space, innumerable galaxies stare back at her and glitter their welcome. She remembers that moment, possibilities and potential branching like fractals, infinite possibilities for infinite stars; and yet, six stars shine brightest of all. Someone hands her something sweet that tastes of honey and spices, and the world smells of citrus and the sea. Fragrance embraces her, the sweetness lingering upon her tongue—the past and the present dancing together in a shared instant.</p> 
                   <p>But before and after… Nothing. </p> 
                   <p>And then, in some time or none at all: heat, and the rain on Sovyrian’s canals.</p> 
                   <p>Ciravel’s young adulthood was spent at the university, where she earned impeccably high marks studying xenobotany, while also attending martial arts and combat training. Time rarely seemed to be the issue for Ciravel “But how do you manage it all?” her classmates asked. Ciravel shrugged. “I plan well. I have to.”</p> 
                   <p>And she did need to plan. Multitudes of worlds and peoples mean multitudes of different shapes, sizes, limb configurations, and body structures. For Ciravel, it meant a body which, since birth, has been particularly responsive to varying gravities, atmospheric pressures, and other planetary properties. Some days, and in some places, Ciravel has little-to-no pain and walking isn’t a problem. Other times or places, she manages exhaustion and pain. Like many others across the Pact Worlds and beyond, using a hoverchair, or a cane for shorter distances, helps Ciravel reduce fatigue and makes moving around less difficult and painful. She trained to fight while using her chair, harnessing the thrusters and momentum to dodge and attack, conserving energy, to use her cane to counterbalance and anchor herself. Ways to minimize a bad day amongst the good and maximize a good day amidst the bad. But never knowing what sort of day was ahead meant Ciravel had to learn early how to plan for each possibility. So, she’d examine each potential outcome and prepare for each iteration until it became instinctual.</p> 
                   <p>After graduation, Ciravel’s academic success in xenobotany caught the Sovyrian leadership’s attention, and in time, she was trusted with occasional official journeys to Absalom Station. Each time she boarded a starship, it felt more like home than Sovyrian ever had. It was the end of one of these trips, heading back through the station towards her waiting ship, that she was stopped in her tracks by the smell of crisp citrus in the sea air. </p> 
                   <p>It was a scent she had all but forgotten, and in an instant, she was back in the memory of a window and stars and spiced honey. And in that moment, existing in two times, simultaneously, she understood. She could bend this moment to her needs. She could stretch time—delay her departure long enough to find the source of the fragrance. It wouldn’t last long, and it’d be exhausting, but it would be enough.</p>

                   <br> 
                   <p>She stretched time at the docks and compressed it nearby. Following the fragrance, or perhaps led by it, she found the source—a young woman with golden eyes and swirling tattoos that almost seemed to dance, carrying a bundle under her arm and walking quickly into a small temple with a shattered mirror on the door—the sign of the Gap Recollective. Ciravel peered in, and when the woman drew back the cloth of the bundle, it revealed a truly ancient warhammer engraved with glowing Dwarven runes. Ciravel tasted spiced honey on her tongue. The young woman looked at her. Smiled. </p> 
                   <p>And Ciravel was suddenly back on the ship home.</p> 
                   <p>Years went by, and Ciravel became the default representative for most off-planet xenobotany meetings. Her excursions were always on time, dodged inclement weather, and when her insular life among the elves caused a diplomatic faux pas, it was somehow forgotten by the next meeting. With the arrival of the <em>Idari</em>, Ciravel was invited as part of the elven delegation to the kasathan worldship. She observed adat and was awed to note that after death the kasatha, like she, exist in two aligned points in time. She befriended one of the adata, who wore a pin engraved with a circle and arrow containing a six-star constellation.</p> 
                   <p>The six stars from her memory.</p> 
                   <p>The adata explained it as the symbol of Ibra, The Inscrutable. Guardian of mysteries and miracles, of exploration and discovery and the cosmos. They spoke at length of Ibra and cosmic enigmas swirling like nebulas and questions, but eventually, Ciravel bid the adata farewell and boarded the ship to Castrovel.</p> 
                   <p>Another young woman boards Ciravel’s ship. She smiles at Ciravel with golden eyes as an unfamiliar object peeks out from the bundle tucked under a tattoo-adorned arm.</p> 
                   <p>Citrus and spiced honey and salt flood Ciravel’s senses. Time stops.</p> 
                   <p>Ciravel tastes the stars a third time. And this time, she understands.</p> 
                   <p>Her memory is of the Gap. And either this woman with the golden eyes or this strange object is a link to it.</p> 
                   <p>Ciravel untangles the possibilities—the present and the future, selecting a strand, tracing it forward. She knows this woman, Prindra, will lead Ciravel to the Gap Recollective on Castrovel. That Ciravel will peer into the maelstrom of the Recollective’s esoteric secrets, and someone, or something, will peer back. That they will hunt her, thinking three moves and four dimensions ahead. Ciravel unknots another time-thread and finds people who can help her, who she will help, who will become trusted companions. Ciravel knows she will become Forlorn, but feels no despair, for she will bend time itself for the friends she will make, keeping them safe on new worlds as they explore the mysteries of the stars together. Invigorated, Ciravel takes these strands and twists them together, weaving them into a new, stronger thread. Possibility.</p> 
                   <p>She peers out the window, smiling at galaxies glittering with infinite potential and adventure and possibility, for Ciravel has time.</p> 
                   <p>Despite understanding and manipulating the mechanisms of time, Ciravel is by no means omniscient. She selects the best plan based on the information she has on a given topic, and even when she knows an outcome, she still gets nervous from time to time. She also recognizes that someone may have information that informs a different option than the one she has chosen, so, while she will defend her statements, Ciravel is willing to follow another’s suggested plan. Her humor tends to be dry and occasionally dark, but she is playful and loyal with people she trusts. </p> 
                   <p>Ciravel’s insular upbringing can manifest both as ignorance, condescension, and elitism—she corrects inaccuracies, but lacks firsthand knowledge about much of the galaxy, its peoples, their worlds, and their cultures, not for want of curiosity, but simply from a lack of exposure—more than once, cultural ignorance has put Ciravel into a sticky situation. She can be impatient and often will finish others’ sentences, assuming she knows what they were going to say, and she’s usually right. When all is said and done, there is nothing that thrills Ciravel more than exploring the galaxy, putting together a puzzle, and staring out at the stars with her friends.</p>

The Broken Tusk following has survived another winter, but a new year just began, and signs of danger foretell a year unlike any before.</p> 
                   <p>Unless their newest party of scouts can secure a safe route through the wilds, saber-toothed beasts, warmongering rivals, and the ever-looming possibility of natural disaster all threaten to end an ancient people’s legacy. Will the Broken Tusks succumb to the elements and surrender to their rivals? Or will you guide your following to glory and reclaim a stolen birthright?</p>

                   <p>Hello, everyone! </p> 
                   <p itemprop="description">As 2021 draws to a close and we prepare to launch our 2022 programs, we're shaking up our popular Bounties line!</p> 
                   <p><a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/standalone/bounties">Pathfinder Bounties</a> are PDF adventure products that launched in 2020. They're designed to fill about an hour of play and act as an easy introduction to Pathfinder Second Edition. They can be used as standalone adventures, strung together in any order as a series, or used as transitions and side quests in between longer adventures and campaigns. While Bounties take place in specific areas, they can be used in any campaign setting. Each bounty is also sanctioned for play in our Pathfinder Society Organized Play program and is repeatable.</p> 
                   <p>So, what's changing? I'm so glad you asked!</p> 
                   <p>Up until now, all of our Bounties have been level 1 Pathfinder adventures. Beginning in 2022, our Pathfinder Bounties are leveling up! You can expect four Pathfinder Bounties in 2022, all for Level 3! The first of these level 3 bounties is scheduled to release in February. Our final level 1 bounty, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02al1?Pathfinder-Bounty-17-Sodden-Stories"><em>Pathfinder Bounty #17: Sodden Stories</em></a>, by Michael Bramnik, is scheduled to release this month. </p> 
                   <p>Additionally, in January of 2022, we're launching Starfinder Bounties! You can expect six Starfinder Bounties in 2022, all for level 1. Our Starfinder Bounties are sanctioned for play in the Starfinder Society Organized Play program and are repeatable. Starfinder Bounties grant 1/4 of an XP and 200 credits. While they don't grant Downtime rewards or Reputation, they do offer generous credits for their length. The first of these Starfinder Bounties is already announced: <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02apn?Starfinder-Bounty-1-The-Cantina-Job"><em>Starfinder Bounty #1: The Cantina Job</em></a> by John Godek III.</p> 
                   <p>I hope you're as excited for the future of Pathfinder and Starfinder Bounties as I am!</p> 
                   <p>Take care, and happy gaming!</p>

                   <p>Hey there, Allie here! I’m a freelance game designer and writer with indie projects of my own but also work on games like the <em>Thirsty Sword Lesbians</em> expansion<em> Advanced Lovers and Lesbians</em> (“Shinsei Galactic Puroresu: The Final Engagement — Revolution”), Brinkwood: The Blood of Tyrants (“The Scene Is Dead, Long Live The Scene”), and <em>Into the Mother Lands</em>. Sealord Amodjun and Iolanthe were among the first NPCs I ever wrote for Paizo. Looking back, I think I’ve grown a lot since, but they’re NPCs I’ve still got some fondness for.</p> 
                   <p>You can find me around the internet on Twitter talking about my cat (<a href="http://twitter.com/madpierrot">http://twitter.com/madpierrot</a>), Twitch playing and making games (<a href="http://twitch.tv/madpierrottv">http://twitch.tv/madpierrottv</a>), TikTok serving up GMing and game design advice (<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@lemadpierrot">https://www.tiktok.com/@lemadpierrot</a>), and Patreon also making games (<a href="http://patreon.com/madpierrot">http://patreon.com/madpierrot</a>). You can also check out my itch.io page (<a href="https://madpierrot.itch.io/">(https://madpierrot.itch.io/</a>) for my games like <em>HEIST</em> and <em>The Way You Make Me Feel</em>. </p>

                   <h3>Jeremy Corff </h3> 
                   <p>Hello! I’m Jeremy, and I was thrilled to write Haigen Topkick for the <em>Absalom, City of Lost Omens</em> book. The Puddles has always been a great adventure location in Absalom, and I couldn’t pass up a chance to contribute to that dangerous local. I hope ol’ Haigen has a chance to make things more complicated for anybody who ventures into the water-logged district he calls home.</p> 
                   <p>If you’d like to find out more about other projects I’ve worked on, you can find me on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/Belabras">@Belabras</a> or at my Starfinder blog <a href="https://solorunstudio.com/">https://solorunstudio.com/</a> where I post weekly homebrew Starfinder content. You can also find my work in my Starfinder adventure “Added Value,” in several Legendary Games publications, <em>Wayfinders</em> #16 through #21, on Starfinder Infinite, and in the upcoming <em>Kingmaker Anniversary Edition Companion Guide</em>.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Vanessa Hoskins (she/her)</h3> 
                   <p>Hello everyone! I had the pleasure of writing The Docks and the Wise Quarter sections. The Docks is the perfect place to go to wish loved ones a "bon voyage" or check on the latest imported wares from Arcadia. There’s also Besmara’s Boardwalk for some carnival games and deep-fried foods, or The Mithril Chef for a fine dining experience where Chef Claudette Butterfoot creates masterpieces out of rare, and sometimes dangerous, ingredients. <br> If you want to get cozy with a book at a tea house, or study for your Conjuration final, or engage in book-smuggling, then the Wise Quarter is the place for you. As one of the sleepier parts of Absalom, it’s perfect for students, scholars, and library enthusiasts. Just watch your coin purse, because the Learned Guard cares more if you paid your silver letters than if someone took your coin purse. What are "silver letters" you ask? Read the book!</p> 
                   <p>Once you’ve done that, read <a href="https://www.pathfinderinfinite.com/product/373835/Vellum--Lace-Ep-00-Moving-Day?affiliate_id=3272729"><em>Vellum &amp; Lace</em></a>, a work of serialized fiction on Pathfinder Infinite that takes place in the City at the Center of the World and explores all sorts of exciting locales.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>James Jacobs</h3> 
                   <p>A book about Absalom was one of the first things we published ages ago, and since then most of the development for the city has happened organically across all sorts of products—but mostly through Organized Play. A big part of what I worked on in this book gets categorized under the “Help Erik create text for the connective tissue” once we got started with the first (and smaller) incarnation of this book. There was a lot of connective tissue to create, but my focus was mostly on NPCs and additional locations and sidebar content. Looking back on it all, though, I think the part I enjoyed the most (and I hope folks like it as well!) was writing the various songs that you’ll see in some of the sidebars. It was tough to not go on for pages once I got going on one of them! </p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Virginia Jordan</h3> 
                   <p>Virginia is a life-long PNW resident who loves nothing more than beekeeping, memes about dogs, and completely useless facts about Medieval history. Having worked at Paizo for two years, their time there only fostered their love of fantasy roleplaying games. Their favorite Pathfinder subjects to write about are diseases and fae creatures, and the weirder the subject matter, the better. In their free time, they enjoy LARPing and creating props and costumes. They are also a professional photographer with a focus on non-traditional portraiture. You can find their work at <a href="https://jordanimages.com/">JordanImages.com</a></p>

                   <h3>Matt Morris</h3> 
                   <p>I’m Matt Morris, and I’ve been lucky enough to do freelance writing for Pathfinder and Starfinder for several years now, working with Paizo and a few 3rd-party companies, including <a href="http://everybodygames.net/">Everybody Games</a> and <a href="https://www.roguegeniusgames.com/">Rogue Genius Games</a>.</p> 
                   <p>The Lost Omens line for Pathfinder Second Edition has given me the opportunity to explore some of my favorite parts of the setting in the <em>Lost Omens Character Guide</em>, <em>Lost Omens: Gods &amp; Magic</em>, <em>Lost Omens: Legends</em>, and <em>Lost Omens: The Grand Bazaar</em>. Now I’m excited to be contributing to the description of the Coins, Absalom’s bustling commercial district.</p> 
                   <p>I keep an up-to-date list of my work on my Paizo profile, and I’m always looking for interesting projects, so feel free to <a href="https://mattmorris.carrd.co/">contact me</a> if you are looking for a reliable writer!</p> 
                   <p>When not writing, I’m teaching high school English near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Mikhail Rekun</h3> 
                   <p>Уважаемые читатели, дожили! I’m Mikhail Sergeyevich Rekun, and you may recall me from past Lost Omens such as <em>Legends</em> (Baba Yaga, Eutropia) and <em>Mwangi Expanse</em> (Mbe’ke, gnolls, Mwangi Jungle, Terwa Uplands). When not writing for Paizo, I’m a Russian-American historian, educator, and author.</p> 
                   <p>I wrote for Absalom fairly early in my freelancing career, and it was until very recently my largest project by far. I wrote the Shadow War section, the Petal District, and several of the NPCs, including Dyrianna, Lady Adrielle, Lord Kerkis, Lord Avid, and my personal favorite, Samel Maleagant of the Court of Black Paper (last seen snooping around Eutropia in <em>Lost Omens Legends</em>). Looking back, I’m still quite proud of the things that I wrote, particularly the Court of Black Paper (an exceedingly heterodox Norgorberite cult) and the contours of the Shadow War at large (a political struggle with genuine issues that make for some very strange bedfellows).</p> 
                   <p>I should mention that I am also working these days on a different sort of city book, <em>Ourichor: Fulcrum of the Luminant Age</em>, a rather stranger sort of city spread across seven ancient derricks in a world recovering from the Cold Darkness. Check it out at <a href="https://twitter.com/LuminantA">https://twitter.com/LuminantA</a>!</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>David N. Ross</h3> 
                   <p>I'm delighted to bring you much of the chapters on Absalom’s ancient and magical keeps and the military organizations that run them. I have a special place in my heart for the Starwatch and all sorts of spycraft. Since I can never get enough politics and intrigue, my next big project is a Pathfinder first edition sourcebook with rules supporting that kind of play. It’s called <em>Spheres of Guile</em> from Drop Dead Studios, and it's now <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/adammeyers/spheres-of-guile-and-ultimate-engineering">live on Kickstarter</a>! You can also find me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidRossWorlds">@DavidRossWorlds</a></p>

                   <h3>Shahreena Shahrani</h3> 
                   <p>Marhaba! I’m Shahreena Shahrani, a Malaysian-American educator, writer, and researcher. I’ve been contributing to the expanding worlds of Pathfinder and Starfinder for several years. I can’t tell you how happy I am that this book is finally out! </p> 
                   <p>My contribution to the licit and illicit! markets and drugs, trademasters, and guilds in the Lost Omens line for Pathfinder Second Edition has been inspired by the peoples and cultures of the Middle East. From the stimulating qat cultivated on the terraced mountains of Sana’a (Yemen); to the historic Khan el-Khalili souq in Cairo (Egypt), where merchants and artisans enjoy the thrill of haggling and bartering with customers; to the night market at Jemaa el-Fnaa in Marrakesh (Morocco), where vendors and their wares appear almost magically with the setting of the sun; and the incredible warmth, generosity, and strength of diverse peoples. I also named one of the NPCs, Namira, after my cat! </p> 
                   <p>When not gaming, I teach Arabic and Persian culture courses, and deliver lectures/presentations on hot topics to government agencies and personnel. Additionally, I create storytelling adapted from world folklore on my YouTube channel. </p> 
                   <p>I’m always looking for interesting projects, so feel free to email me at shahreena_s@yahoo.com. </p>

                   <p itemprop="description">Greetings, friends! It's that time of year again where we begin to assemble our organizing committees for our major conventions!</p> 
                   <p>Now, we haven't done this in at least a year, if not longer, so let's talk about what that means. For our major shows (such as PaizoCon and Gen Con), we have a volunteer organizing committee that runs our organized play space. This group works closely with me, as the Organized Play Coordinator, to determine the schedule, recruit GMs, and get them everything they need to make the show a success!</p> 
                   <p>Obviously, there's a <em>lot</em> about 2022 that's up in the air. If we've learned anything from the past two years, it's that we can't predict the future. However, I want to share what our current plans are, with the understanding that they may change significantly.</p> 
                   <p>We are currently investigating running our major shows as <b>hybrid shows</b>. This would mean that we would have both a physical presence at the event as well as online offerings, featuring the same scenarios that are premiering at the physical shows. As a result, we're looking for applicants who have the ability to assist with both physical and online events. Safety requirements and all those sorts of things will be announced well in advance of physical shows, we're not ready to talk about those yet, but rest assured that Organized Play will be following the latest CDC Guidelines as well as the show's safety policies to keep attendees safe.</p> 
                   <p>Below is some specific information about the shows we're currently looking to form committees for: <b>PaizoCon 2022</b>, <b>Gen Con 2022</b> and <b>PaizoCon Europe 2022</b>. There may be additional shows added to the major convention schedule next year (such as PAX Unplugged), and if we add more, we'll do a similar call for committee members. There are some positions we know we're looking for, but we're also seeking general interest for all our shows; let us know if you're interested and what skills you bring to the table!</p> 
                   <p>Please note that joining a committee is a significant commitment; there is a lot of preparation work to do to get ready for a show, and especially coming out of two years of not having physical shows, we'll be doing a lot of rebuilding to figure out our new processes. Committee members are compensated with convention rewards as if they had GMed the maximum number of slots at the convention. Additionally, committee members who are not already Venture Officers are granted benefits for the year at the VL or VC level, depending on their position. Note that anybody is free to apply for a committee; we welcome those who are not already Venture Officers!</p>

               <p class="date"><time datetime="2021-12-15T21:30:00Z"></time></p> 
               <p itemprop="description">The manuscript that follows is taken from but a single source, stored at Windsong Abbey. It is impossible to verify the authorship of “Fafnheir’s Lament”; the book in which it is contained also includes a bestiary and various tales of monster-hunting. If authentic, the lament—written in Skald—must have been copied and recopied many times over its ten-thousand-year history, potentially introducing scribal errors. Translation was further complicated when a fire broke out at the abbey centuries ago; an anonymous librarian saved the book, but not before the manuscript was singed along one edge. The damage was not extensive, but enough to make many passages difficult to read and some phrases entirely indecipherable. The edition presented here represents the best efforts of the abbey’s staff.</p>

It is impossible to verify the authorship of “Fafnheir’s Lament”; the book in which it is contained also includes a bestiary and various tales of monster-hunting. If authentic, the lament—written in Skald—must have been copied and recopied many times over its ten-thousand-year history, potentially introducing scribal errors. Translation was further complicated when a fire broke out at the abbey centuries ago; an anonymous librarian saved the book, but not before the manuscript was singed along one edge. The damage was not extensive, but enough to make many passages difficult to read and some phrases entirely indecipherable. The edition presented here represents the best efforts of the abbey’s staff.</p>

                    <p>So, fresh from the First World I came, Fafnheir,<br> Burdened and brandishing the eggs of my brood.<br> Boldly I’d taken the blood of my brother<br> And the price, my penance, was the exile’s path.<br> Now on Golarion I gazed, greedily,<br> For glory and gold was mine to gather.<br> From mountains where men rode upon mammoths <br> To the Obari Ocean, none could oppose me.<br> Warriors and would-be kings both went<br> Groaning with grief into my gullet.<br> I felt certain Fafnheir was fiercest,<br> First among foes, now and forever.<br> That was good killing.</p> 
                    <p>But fat on the fear of fools, I forgot<br> The fickle future of fortune’s wheel.<br> For although the life of a linnorm is long,<br> And time toughens us like an oaken tree,<br> No royal or regent is allowed to rule<br> Longer than the law of cruel fate allows.<br> Your might won’t matter, is what I am meaning,<br> When you gaze upon a god and grasp<br> The golden age of your glory is gone.<br> Heed my history, and hew<br> To the wisdom which I have won.<br> Listen to the lament of the first linnorm.</p> 
                    <p>Millennia ago by mortal measure,<br> Veiled villains seeking vengeance<br> Summoned the Starstone from the depths of space.<br> But Acavna of Azlant, bride of Amaznen<br> Made a magnificent shield of the moon.<br> She shattered the Starstone into shards<br> And some souls were spared.<br> But gone was the glory of ancient Golarion,<br> And men became cowards crouching in caves.</p> 
                    <p>Into this apocalyptic air I ascended<br> To witness what wonder remained in the world.<br> I sojourned south, taking the swan’s road,<br> And all that my eye encompassed was empty.<br> Fewer folk than you have fingers<br> Lived in that lonely desolate land.<br> But as I approached the antipodes by air<br> Stalwart survivors began to be seen,<br> Sheltering in the shade of Mwangi’s shield.<br> Here were heroes a linnorm could hunt,<br> So down I descended, hungry for dinner.</p> 
                    <p>The trees were towering torches<br> Blazing below me, their light blinding.<br> Under that kindling canopy were helpless kin-folk,<br> Mortal men and elves, Mualijae<br> Caught in a barbarous burning. <br> Time had taught them the meaning of terror,<br> For a dreadful dragon had chosen today<br> To descend and deal devastation.<br> But the fear that filled them wasn’t for Fafnheir,<br> And my blood boiled as I wondered what bastard<br> Had the craft and the courage to steal my kill.<br> Then I drew near to dread Dahak,<br> Dealer of death and desolation.<br> Then the father of linnorms felt fear<br> For the Age of Ashes had arrived.</p>

                    <p>Dark is the day I first saw Dahak<br> Feasting on fools who howled as they fled.<br> Spells and spears he shattered for sport,<br> Shields splintered, they perished in shame.<br> Blades that breached him were, by his blood,<br> Melted to mist like ice in a meadow.<br> A Mualijae maid raised her voice in mourning<br> And the greedy one paused, engrossed by her grief.<br> She sang of centuries filled with sorrow<br> How Starstone survivors became food for the slaughter.<br> But the monster was unmoved by her music;<br> Sky swallowed the smoke.</p> 
                    <p>Many are the deaths that delvers discover<br> When they dare their descent into the depths:<br> A poisonous point in the depths of a pit,<br> Or their corpse consumed by gelatinous cube,<br> Or reduced to dust, disintegrated,<br> Or by the relentless reach of a mummy’s rot,<br> Their strength sapped as they’re turned to stone<br> By the sudden stare of a medusa’s snakes,<br> Or mauled by a minotaur lost in a maze,<br> Or by a bear with the brow of an owl disemboweled.</p> 
                    <p>But lo, this litany now must be lengthened,<br> Expanding the examples of exsanguination,<br> For dungeon delvers have new ways to die:<br> Caught and cut by the dragon god’s claws<br> Or by his bite sent to the Great Beyond.<br> A swipe of his tail scatters them stumbling,<br> Beaten by the buffet of his batlike wings.<br> And finally flames hot as a furnace<br> Brightly furious forth from him fly.<br> The fearful fools caught in that fire<br> Are fried in a flash by that perilous flood.</p> 
                    <p>Lament for the linnorm who has boasted his last.<br> Long is his life, but brief is his legacy.<br> Shunted and shamed, by Dahak overshadowed,<br> To caves in the crags Fafnheir will crawl.<br> From that darkness I’ll dare not emerge. Day’s<br> Luminous light on the father of linnorms<br> Shall not shine. And my shimmering scales<br> Will henceforth be hidden, this for my hubris.<br> Wanderers into my web will be welcomed,<br> As I break my fast on their brittle bone-house.<br> But never again by noon or night<br> Will I hunt heroes, as was my habit.</p>

                  <p>On the northern reaches of Varisia’s Lost Coast stands Windsong Abbey, a forum for interfaith discussion tended by priests of nearly twenty faiths and led by a legacy of Masked Abbesses. At the dawn of the Age of Lost Omens, Windsong Abbey suffered as its faithful fought and fled, but today it has begun to recover. A new Masked Abbess guides a new flock within, and the Windsong Testaments—parables about the gods themselves—are once again being recorded within the abbey’s walls. Some of these Testaments are presented here as Golarion’s myths and fables. Some parts may be true. Other parts are certainly false. Which ones are which is left to the faithful to decide.</p>

                  <blockquote> 
                   <p itemprop="description">Leandra slapped the screaming alarm cube and rubbed her eyes before burying her head in the pillow again. <em>Ugh, too early…</em></p> 
                   <p>A few minutes later she groaned and rolled out of her bunk, stretching as she padded her way into the communal area.</p> 
                   <p>"Oh, morning, Lea. I just drank the last of the instant. Sorry." Her overly chipper, and well caffeinated roommate held up the empty pot apologetically. </p> 
                   <p>“Nok! How could you? You knew I was pulling a double today!” The scowl she leveled at the curvy ysoki would send most others hurrying out of her way, but Nok just grinned and stretched up to kiss her on the cheek. </p> 
                   <p>“I'll pick up more on the way home tonight, promise!" She rushed out the door in a swirl of activity and perfume, leaving Leandra to put the coffee pot in the sink.</p> 
                   <p>Thirty minutes and a disappointingly lukewarm shower later (<em>thanks again, Nok</em>) Leandra stood in line at the popular coffee cart just outside Ixomander’s Throne, the Azlanti-themed casino where she was currently late for her job. She hopped from foot to foot, willing the line to move faster before Mo-var, the meticulous android running the cart, closed for their mid-morning break. Suddenly, an enormous vesk came hurtling out of nowhere and plowed into her. She was knocked onto the ground, while the vesk continued running. A willowy shirren helped her back on her feet before bolting after the vesk, shouting “Sorry!” over their shoulder.</p> 
                   <p>Leandra dusted off her dark green pants and turned to see Mo-var pulling down their cart’s shudder. <em>Damned tourists! Don’t they know how hard it is to keep this faux Azlanti crap clean?</em> She threw her hands up in despair, yelling, “Come on! I was in line and everything before those junk jockeys pushed me over!” Mo-var ignored her, and she went to give the cart a swift kick but stopped when a glint from the ground caught her eye. A misshapen piece of metal and plastic laid on the sidewalk, most likely dropped by the fleeing vesk. </p> 
                   <p>Leandra picked it up and shouted in the direction the two had ran. “Just because we live near a junkyard doesn’t mean you can litter!” She grumbled to herself about inconsiderate off-worlders and inflexible androids, absent-mindedly slipped the piece of trash into her pocket, and stepped into the casino.</p>

                    <hr width="50%">
                   </center> 
                   <br> 
                   <p>Leandra stretched she trudged out of the casino, her back aching after a grueling double shift on her feet serving drinks to increasingly inebriated gamblers. Spying Mo-var’s coffee cart—now open for the evening rush—and knowing that Nok probably forgot to get more instant, she started to wander over. Her way was blocked by a pair of local gang members (<em>True Warriors by the look of them—bunch of lowlifes</em>) diving out of the way of the wide swing of a doshko, wielded by the same vesk from earlier in the day. This time, a lashunta woman followed, her hands glowing with magic.</p> 
                   <p>“Really?” Leandra said out loud, too tired to properly process how much danger she was currently in. Mo-var, however, seemed to understand, quickly closing their cart window. Leandra was startled into action when a stray bullet from one of the True Warriors’ pistols struck the casino wall just a few feet from her. She scurried home, locked the deadbolts, and enabled the security system even though she knew it didn’t work properly. Nok had promised to get it fixed months ago.</p> 
                   <center>
                    <hr width="50%">
                   </center> 
                   <br> 
                   <p>Nok stumbled in, giggling and slightly tipsy. The security system let out a pair of weak, unconvincing beeps and gave up, but it was loud enough to startle Leandra awake from where she’d dozed off on the couch. </p> 
                   <p>“Someone had a good night.” </p> 
                   <p>Nok plopped onto the couch next to her. “Hot date with Rush! Oh, so much fun. You should come out with us one of these days! She even has a cute brother...” She chuckled, draping herself over Leandra.</p> 
                   <p>“No time. We’re short-staffed at work. Maybe next week.” She pushed her friend off her lap with a laugh. Nok was always trying to set her up on dates—when she wasn’t on the prowl for her own that is. She’d gone on more than a few disastrous outings at the younger girl’s urging but hadn't clicked with any of her suitors. “Tell you what, I’ll make us both something to eat. You need something in your stomach.” She ruffled the hair beneath Nok’s ear on her way to the kitchenette.</p> 
                   <center>
                    <hr width="50%">
                   </center> 
                   <br> 
                   <p>The next day, Leandra had another double. Midway through, her feet and back were already aching and her ears were sweltering in her fake helmet, but she kept a smile firmly plastered on her face as she bustled between tables and the bar. Needing a break from fending off the advances of the junk jockeys who had hit a prize and enduring the glowering looks from the locals determined to lose all their cash, she gestured to her manager that she was going to briefly step outside.</p> 
                   <p>She ordered a cup of her usual from Mo-var to boost her flagging energy and had barely taken a sip when her arm was jostled from behind, sending the drink flying. </p> 
                   <p>“Oh. Come. On!” She was nearly in tears as she turned to see the shirren from the previous day. A ysoki stood next to them, looking sheepish, and the vesk and lashunta were over by the casino entrance. </p> 
                   <p>“YOU!” Leandra gasped. “You owe me at least 3 cups of coffee!” She poked the shirren in the chest, whose antennae twitched in confusion. “First, you knocked me out of line, then you started that brawl in the street, and now you made me spill this one because you can’t bother to watch where you’re going!”</p> 
                   <p>The big vesk lumbered up to them. “Is there a problem?” she rumbled.</p> 
                   <p>“Yeah! You and your buddies keep making me lose my coffee and I’m getting sick of it!” Leandra’s shouting was beginning to draw a few gawkers, but she didn't care. “And another thing! You can’t just leave trash wherever you want!” She retrieved the piece of metal and plastic from her pocket and flung it at the vesk’s chest. The vesk fumbled with it for a moment but didn’t drop it. Her eyes widened as she took a better look at the scrap.</p> 
                   <p>“Quig,” the vesk said, turning to the ysoki. “This is the other half of the keycard.”</p> 
                   <p>“You dropped it?!” the ysoki asked incredulously.</p> 
                   <p>“Uh, I guess so.” The vesk looked uncomfortable. She looked back at Leandra. “Hey, sorry about all this. Let me make it up to you. After all, I think you just saved us a lot of trouble.” She ordered an extra-large from Mo-var, handing over enough credits to cover the price a few times over. The android filled up a sizable travel mug with a secured lid and placed it in the cart’s window. Leandra scooped up the coffee and chugged half of it as if she were afraid it would get away.</p> 
                   <p>“Thank you,” Leandra said. “I have to get back to work now.” She turned on her heel to re-enter the casino, hearing the other four begin to chatter excitedly with each other.</p> 
                   <p>Later, she had quite the story to tell her roommate. Nok suspected the four were treasure hunters looking for a big score out in the junk, and they must have crossed the True Warriors in the process. Both of them speculated wildly as to what their “keycard” unlocked well into the night.</p>

                   <br> 
                   <p>The following evening, the four approached Leandra on the casino floor. “There she is!” the vesk bellowed with a grin on her face. “My favorite Aeon Guard! We’ve got something for you!” She dropped a credstick onto Leandra’s tray.</p> 
                   <p>A little wary, Leandra picked up the credstick, peeked at the display, and nearly fainted at the amount printed there. She wrapped her arm around the vesk’s waist in gratitude.</p> 
                   <p>“Should be enough to keep you in coffee for a while,” the ysoki smirked. “And when you’re done squeezing Obo to death, we’ll have a round of your most expensive booze. In fact, make ‘em doubles. We’re celebrating another successful mission!” </p> 
                   <p>The group cheered.</p>

                   <p>As a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, Jasper's Game Day's mission is to raise funds for suicide prevention and awareness. Through this, they strive to reduce the stigma around talking about mental health so the world can start treating it just like physical health. But they’re so much more than that: they’re building a community of unique individuals with a love for all things RPG. They combine the fun of tabletop roleplay with the quest toward suicide awareness and prevention, and it’s nothing short of amazing.</p> 
                   <p>One way to support them is the auction for seats to play LIVE with:</p> 
                   <ul>

                   </ul> 
                   <p>Demiplane brings roleplaying fans together to make games better, providing high-quality tools to form groups and enhance the ways games can be played, shared, and explored. Launched in 2020 by Peter Romenesko and Travis Frederick, lifelong friends and die-hard RPG players, Demiplane looks to revolutionize how people engage with and enjoy roleplaying games.

                   <p>In reducing the stigma around mental health, we want to be able to help prevent suicide, and not just respond to the aftermath. We want to bring the community together and show everyone that they are not alone!</p>

                   <p>These three holidays were first introduced by our own Jenny Jarzabski in a heartwarming short story released in last year’s <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shhy?Starfinder-Society-December-Previews"><em>Starfinder Society December Previews</em></a> blog post.

                   <p>We’ve got some great scenarios in store for Pathfinders this month as well! And, you might say, they start off with a bang.</p> 
                   <p>With Pathfinder agents spread across the Inner Sea to handle urgent problems at the Society’s lodges, shadowy enemies have decided to take advantage of the Grand Lodge’s apparent lack of defenders to infiltrate the vaults. Fortunately for the Society, it has made some new allies in recent years, and they’ve lent their cunning and expertise to bolster the Grand Lodge’s defenses. While a group of agents is preparing to embark on a mission in Osirion, the infiltrators make their move—and their leader is coming with them.</p> 
                   <p>I wonder if the new defenses are going to help repel the—<em>KRAKOOOOOOM!</em></p> 
                   <p>You’ll have to play to find out. <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02akp?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-306-Struck-by-Shadows"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-06: Struck by Shadows</em></a>, by Paizo’s own Luis Loza, is a Year of Shattered Sanctuaries metaplot adventure for levels 3–6. It is the second part of the four-part “Absalom arc,” which began with <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027s9?Pathfinder-Society-Intro-Year-of-Shattered-Sanctuaries"><em>Pathfinder Society Intro: Year of Shattered Sanctuaries</em></a> and will continue with two other scenarios in the coming months.</p>

                   <br> 
                   <p>Meanwhile, another group of agents has learned that Venture-Captain Varian Jeggare, still a captive of nefarious enemies in Cheliax, has been taken to a secure location the Pathfinder Society has long thought to be abandoned. The site is brimming with guards and infernal dangers, and it won’t be easy for the agents to make their way in, locate the missing venture-captain, defeat his captors, and make it out alive.</p> 
                   <p>But an unexpected guest shows up as they’re preparing for their mission. A sinister guest, with a sinister offer. With so much at stake, perhaps the agents would be foolish to refuse…</p> 
                   <p><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02akq?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-307-The-Locked-Lodge"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-07: The Locked Lodge</em></a>, by veteran Pathfinder Society author Kalervo Oikarinen, is another Year of Shattered Sanctuaries metaplot adventure for levels 3–6. It is the second part of the two-part “Cheliax arc,” which began with <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02ajc?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-304-The-DevilWrought-Disappearance"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-04: The Devil-Wrought Disappearance</em></a>. </p>
                   <p>As a reminder, all of the Year of Shattered Sanctuaries metaplot scenarios are part of small arcs taking place in various Inner Sea regions. The arcs can be played in any order, with any character of the appropriate level. While we recommend that you play the scenarios within a given arc in order—to better enjoy the narrative—it is not a requirement.</p> 
                   <p>Explore! Report! Cooperate! Happy holidays!</p>

                  <blockquote> 
                   <p itemprop="description">Do you remember sleep?</p> 
                   <p>It is one of the few clear memories I have from before the transplant. Falling into bed after a day of dedicated study. Waking, many hours later, to Sarenrae’s gentle wingbeats stirring the sky into morning splendor. That curious gulf between night and dawn and, after its crossing, how the voyage leaves one with only faint impressions of the journey. The remnants of dreams. Not fragments, exactly, but tiles without a mosaic.</p> 
                   <p>I remember sleep. But when I try to assemble those memories into a feeling, I cannot. I lack some essential component. Like forgetting the melody of your wedding song or straining to see through heat shimmer. There are ancient moments that I <em>can</em> feel, of course. The blood of the Pharaoh’s oathsworn on my muzzle. The uncertainty of moving on four limbs for the first time. The strange sensation of an arcane core—<em>my</em> core—thrumming where once a heart beat, and the dried blossom sorrow of seeing myself still and quiet in the sling of an artificer’s lattice. Caressing that castoff self’s face with newly forged digits.</p> 
                   <p>I have seen so many castoffs in this place; surely one of them was you. And maybe it is you who brought me here. As I picked my way through the dusty brass halls, past conduits thrumming with arcane vitality, it all felt so familiar. Not merely because of the similarity to my own second birthplace, but because the faint reflections of this creche have haunted me all these thousands of years.</p> 
                   <p>We do not sleep, you and I, but we do something like it. And so many times, upon exiting that pale facsimile of slumber, I would grasp at shards of foreign dreams. Visions like snowflakes—have you seen snow?—melting even as I touch them. Muted cataracts plummeting through crystalline bends, thaumaturgic rivers rushing toward unseen reservoirs. Rivulets of sand falling through a vault of brass and mithral and stone, down into a craftwork cathedral whose catacombs the dream fragments would not touch.</p> 
                   <p>I know that the Automaton Council left their names within our cores. Perhaps the masters somehow carved others’ memories inside my being. Gadflies in the mind, grit in a mouthful of water—and there! Drink, another thing remembered but not felt.</p> 
                   <p>One grows bored over the millennia. What does a soldier do when they find themself without a war? With need for neither sword nor plowshares? I was not built for peace. So I sought conflict. A wasted century spent stalking our first enemies from the east. Many years more chasing the thrill of the hunt, following the moonlit metal gleam of pack leaders. I clawed crimson paths up the heaving flanks of rough beasts. I even sunk my fangs into one of the architects of Jistka’s downfall; he thought himself safe in his sarcophagus. But the empire is no more, and even when I can find others like myself, those brief reunions cannot fully replace the pride of <em>belonging</em> to a thing. Of serving something greater and knowing that that service <em>matters</em>.</p> 
                   <p>Can you turn your head? Yes, the racks there—the weapons of an ancient an irrelevant war. And ourselves, of course.</p> 
                   <p>…I am sorry, truly, that you must emerge into this world. Ah, and for my rambling. I’ve been lonely, of late.</p> 
                   <p>In any case. Yes, the visions. All around me there is evidence that those visions were indeed more than spheresong footprints. After seven thousand years, I finally ceased grasping at snowflakes and simply let them fall, observing the pattern. In the shallow waterways of my dormant periods, I sieved stranger’s gold from dreamsand, reassembling the path to this place. Across tundra and lake, through the dead god’s favored city and banished gods’ ports, and into the deserts of my two births. Over the peaks—were these peaks not taller, once?—and up to the ragged edges of a basin.</p> 
                   <p>There are peculiarities to our artificed bodies; perhaps I can show you the trick of venting life force from your limbs. Trailing arcana, I descended toward the basin floor, a vulture circling the past, the heat shimmer below a mirror held up to my aimless aeons. When I touched the sands, they were familiar. Soft and quiet as a burial shroud.</p>

                   <br> 
                   <p>That shroud stirred. Ghosts rose around me. A convergence of minds and memories, as something in my core resonated with the emotions permeating this subterranean complex. It must be the hopes and sorrows of all those who set aside their flesh that fixed those visions to this place. I saw dozens of figures pull themselves from the sands, amber grit sloughing off gleaming brass shoulders. I padded through the arcade of long-gone servants as they set their phantasmal eyegems on the east. Plodded toward dissolution.</p> 
                   <p>Tail trailing in sorrow, I reached the basin’s center. Something glinted beneath the sand; a garnet eye set into a dais. Carved script radiating from the gem bore the Conclave’s ancient words:</p> 
                   <p><em>We leap from flesh to crafted hope<br> To safeguard nation, family, friend<br> We shuck ourselves and start again<br> We rise anew and know no end</em></p> 
                   <p>“Know no end”—foolish and prideful! One cannot live from Age to Age without experiencing endings beyond comprehension. No, the Imperium merely filled the deathless millennia with a thousand lesser endings.</p> 
                   <p>Those fools’ words, the ghosts of my fellows. I admit, I was overcome, crushed by reminders of long-mourned purpose. I sat on my haunches and wept.</p> 
                   <p>Did they give you the ocular fire? I barely notice it, now, but that is another half-remembered echo of my second dawn, that first fulminant beam scorching its way out of my head. Like screaming until your throat is raw, but strangely distant, and channeled so <em>tightly</em> through your sight. Channel your conviction and burn away the Imperium’s enemies. Crumpled in the basin, I had no conviction, and my fire merely trickled out as molten tears.</p> 
                   <p>They splashed against the gem, and the earth also wept and moaned. Sand hissed through widening cracks and, just as your eye did, this place irised open for the first time in ages. Below was the towering vault and crystal-banked streams of liquid arcana from those fragmented memory-dreams. Vindication and wonder soothed my soul. Stairs spiraled down from the dais, and I descended.</p> 
                   <p>Down to the sanctum. No signs of battle, as might be expected given the dreaming ghosts above. An entry hall, and a pristine mosaic of the Conclave breathing life into the first core. I loped through halls of the not-dead, their superfluous forms stacked in memorial niches while their spirits slumber here in the lattices. Slowed to peer into glowing cisterns of swirling arcane energy, still ready to quicken the remnants of the Imperium’s crowning achievement. Followed the burnished ribbon of names that marked the path to this creche.</p> 
                   <p>Why did they abandon this place? No matter—we are here now, together. Memories, both mine and others, lead me to you, and to your dormant siblings. We must wake them.</p> 
                   <p>…I am afraid. Of aimlessness. Of what I bartered with my death.</p> 
                   <p>Of rejection.</p> 
                   <p>I am no Conclave. I am no pack leader. I am merely one lost child of Jistka, one aimless wanderer who followed ancient memories to an ancient vault. But I am here, surrounded by an entire tapestry of lattices, and the joy of dozens of siblings opening bejeweled eyes.</p> 
                   <p>I remember sleep, but I do not remember how it felt. Perhaps you can tell me? And perhaps I, in turn can help you—us—forge a new purpose. One divorced from a Conclave that dissolved before they could lead you out of the space between sleep and death.</p> 
                   <p>The Song of the Spheres fades. The Dawnflower blooms. She reaches even here, below the earth, in this cradle tomb. And for a moment, in her light preserves glimmering dreams, perfect and within our grasp.</p> 
                   <p>Take my hand.</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">It’s strange how quickly a life-changing period spanning years can be replaced by what was once normal. Droven was certainly happy to be back in the field undertaking a Pathfinder mission again, and even happier to have an opportunity to deploy some of the gadgets and weaponry he’d created during his long exodus in Arcadia. He’d even lent his latest weapon, a gun that could create portals, to his partner for the exercise, a clever halfling freelancer from Cheliax who’d come highly recommended by a fellow Pathfinder.</p> 
                   <p>The mission itself was fairly simple. There were reports of a large wolf or canine monster attacking travelers and caravans on the road between Absalom and Otari, a small port town on the western half of the Isle of Kortos. It was almost too simple, and in another place and time, the Pathfinder Society likely wouldn’t have sent a veteran agent still settling in after a long and dangerous journey abroad, but Otari was home to several friends of the Society, and perhaps just as relevant, it often served as a secondary destination for shipments too valuable to the wrong people to bring in through Absalom’s more closely watched ports.</p> 
                   <p>So here Droven found himself, his entertaining companion playing a tune as they walked the forested highway on their way to Otari. As always, Whirp accompanied him, the quirky construct mostly doing what it was designed to do, staying by Droven’s side so the half-orc could readily access the tools it carried, but occasionally wandering off to examine a flower or dew drop on a leaf. Droven had disassembled, reassembled, and repaired the goblin-shaped construct countless times over the years, and he still had no explanation for Whirp’s strange moments of seeming sapience, curiosity, and self-direction. There was some magic interwoven with the clockwork devices that powered Whirp. Perhaps over the years of journeying through Arcadia, Droven’s one-sided conversations with the construct had made some impact on these arcane forces, granting Whirp a tiny spark of personality. Droven still carried on these conversations. While they drew the occasional odd look (once convincing a passing goblin to join in and look to their mechanical counterpart for a response that came in the form of an awkward hug and offered crowbar) most of Droven’s friends and peers had grown used to them and occasionally spoke to Whirp themselves.</p> 
                   <center>
                    <hr width="50%">
                   </center> 
                   <br> 
                   <p>On the evening of their second day out from Absalom, they finally encountered the creature they’d been sent to deal with. Droven was dozing by the fire, Whirp standing at his side and staring intently at an owl perched in the branches above, when their halfling companion whispered magically into his ear from his own hiding spot. “Barghest!”</p> 
                   <p>Droven snapped awake; those years traveling on his own had sharpened his mind and reflexes. Drawing his hammer and putting his back against a nearby tree, he whispered back. “So not a wolf? Unfortunate.”</p> 
                   <p>The same calm that always accompanied moments of stress descended once more over Droven. Later, when the fighting was done, his knees would shake and his eyes would water, but for now he was fully in the moment, the fire of his orcish blood fueling his analytical mind and sharpening his thoughts for the task at hand.</p> 
                   <p>The barghest lurked just beyond the range of the firelight, its batlike ears and hunched shoulders faintly backlit by the leaf-shrouded moon. Droven made a mental note to recommend the halfling for future work; even his own eyes, capable of navigating lightless tunnels and moonless nights with relative ease, could barely make out the creature. Droven doubted he would have noticed the monster had he been on watch, let alone correctly identified it under these conditions. </p> 
                   <p>He hoped their plan worked. Whirp was to leap in front of the threat, then scurry through a portal created by the experimental gun he’d given the halfling. Hopefully, the beast would follow Whirp through the portal, putting itself right in line for a thunderous blow from Droven’s hammer. Of course, they’d made the plan expecting a creature of animal intelligence, not a deadly fiend capable of critical thought with its own repertoire of magic.</p> 
                   <p>Before Droven could propose a new tactic, Whirp began acting on the original plan Droven had modified the little construct to perform.</p> 
                   <p>“Whirrrrrp!”</p>

                   <p>Whether it was an intentional battle cry or merely the sound of the clockwork gears rattling throughout his small frame, it nonetheless signaled the start of the fight. Whirp’s body sparked for a moment before an explosive gout of flame vented from his chassis, launching the construct directly in front of the barghest. For Droven, an eternity seemed to pass as construct and barghest stared at one another, though it was likely no more than a few seconds. With a second “Whirrrrrp,” Droven’s clockwork companion lurched away, dashing through the woods as tools clattered out of the compartment on its back. Droven made a mental note to add a leather flap to the top of Whirp’s built-in toolbox even as he pressed tighter against the tree, hoping the barghest had failed to notice him or had forgotten him chasing after Whirp.</p> 
                   <p>The plan worked to perfection. The halfling opened a portal next to Droven’s hiding spot before opening another in front of Whirp. As Whirp dashed through the eldritch opening, the barghest sped right behind it. As Whirp exited, Droven swung, his hammer whistling above the construct’s head even as the barghest’s snout cleared the portal. With a thunderous crunch, the barghest popped back out of the entry portal, its head lolling weirdly on a broken neck. Droven looked away from the barghest’s death throes, uninterested in exposing himself to another creature’s agonized final moments, and nodded to his halfling companion. A good plan, or at least an effective one, cleanly executed without injury. As much as Droven would have liked to say, “without negative consequences,” he realized that would be an inaccurate assessment. Somewhere scattered among the leaves and roots of the roadside forest, Whirp had lost an expensive and worrisome number of the inventor’s favorite tools.</p>

                   <h3>GM Numbat (they/she)</h3> 
                   <p>I started playing RPGs in the mid-late ‘70s, enjoying the original D&amp;D with its flimsy booklets and fun dice. Within a year, I was running games at my all-girls high school. I’ve played many systems over the years, though usually only briefly and with long breaks between. Partly this was because of a complex interaction of several chronic mental and physical conditions which can limit my abilities. I am grateful for the Paizo Organized Play community, where I found an accepting and welcoming home. </p> 
                   <p>None of my health concerns are obvious by looking at me. The major advantage to this is that when I have a good day, no one prejudges me simply based on appearance. The major disadvantage is that when I am having a bad day, it is difficult for some to understand, as I look “normal.” Over time, I have become better at learning my limits and predicting some of those times that I need to cut back on commitments. Still, I can be caught out with an unexpected flare and have to pull out of playing, or worse, running a game. I always feel terrible when I do, even though most of our community has been wonderfully supportive. Dietary restrictions are a challenge, especially when traveling or wanting to socialize. I catch myself annoyed by someone’s fidgeting or apparent distraction at the table and remind myself that this may be their coping mechanism, just as I have mine. We are each so individual, with our own needs and concerns, often not obvious to others. Let us celebrate those differences and the unique perspective they bring.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Ivis K. Flanagan (she/her)</h3> 
                   <p>Disabilities come in many forms. There are disabilities that the world can observe and recognize. There are others, though, that people fight in the dark, because the social stigma of them can be a <em>silence</em> spell, where the anxiety of the possible response is more encompassing than the darkness of suffering alone. PTSD is one of those.</p> 
                   <p>PTSD is the demon that I fight. While many often associate this fight with former soldiers or others who have been in warzones, those are not the only demons at hand. Any traumatic event can be a catalyst. This is my fight—utilizing weapons of words, medications, and therapy in the ongoing battle. I now add to these this transparency in the hopes that someone else will see that they aren’t alone. You have allies who know these battlefields well.</p> 
                   <p>Another weapon against it is finding safe spaces and friends who care. I have been able to do that through this community—the players, volunteers, freelancers, and staff who I am lucky to call colleagues and friends. This community is ever growing, and its values of inclusion, diversity, and honesty are why it is a safe space, a space I am grateful to help create, and a place where no one has to fight alone. </p>

                   <h3>Avi Kool (they/them)</h3> 
                   <p>Hi all! I’m senior editor at Paizo (on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/legalizegoblins">@legalizegoblins</a>) and multiply disabled, both physically and mentally. Due to hypermobility and congenital muscle issues, I have numerous joint conditions and when walking for more than a few minutes, I have to wear braces on my knees to reduce pain. This can lead to awkward questions, uncomfortable assumptions, and a sense of self-consciousness. Sticking out in public is challenging, whether it’s the braces themselves or the need to use the elevator when all my friends automatically go for the stairs. Additionally, I have a whole cocktail of mental and learning disabilities. This isn’t uncommon; comorbidity is the norm for mental illness and learning disabilities, which is why you often see people listing out a number of disorders. Here’s my list: bipolar disorder, OCD, generalized anxiety disorder, ADHD, and dyscalculia. I struggle with feeling self-conscious about the number of health problems I face, but there’s no need to be ashamed. Disability is actually extremely common, though we don’t talk about it like it is, and many people with disabilities have more than one. </p> 
                   <p>It’s been a huge pleasure to see disability become more prominent in our games. I feel so lucky to have worked on books like <em>Grand Bazaar</em>, where I gave my NPC, Arhan Benimaya, a service dog. Disability *is* normal, and we should treat it as such. </p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Dave Nelson (he/they)</h3> 
                   <p>Hey everybody! I'm Dave Nelson and I live with a handful of disabilities, mainly autism, dyslexia/dysgraphia, and anxiety. Often these "invisible" disabilities get either swept under the rug or have their legitimacy questioned. It makes it quite the uphill battle to get recognized and taken seriously. I feel very strongly that more exposure to what folks with these disabilities are actually like and what they go through will help combat these issues. So from the very start of my writing career I have tried to champion neurodiverse causes and representation as best I can. You can find examples of my neurodiverse characters both in <em>Lost Omens Grand Bazaar</em> in the form of Erikanesh, or the upcoming <em>Absalom, City of Lost Omens</em> with Chun Hye-Seung. You can find me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/davicthegrey">@davicthegrey</a>, talking about my experiences, games, and all other manner of things.</p>

                   <p>Hello, I am Stefan, better known in the TTRPG sphere as Waffles from WafflesMapleSyrup LLC. I am a disabled US Navy veteran with major depressive disorder, tinnitus, as well as other depressive contributing factors such as insomnia and chronic pain. I have battled with suicide in my life and strive to have nobody need to fight that battle alone.</p> 
                   <p>I am one of the two CEOs of WafflesMapleSyrup, who run two separate streams and podcasts. I am the GM of our Starfinder show Journeys Adrift, and I play an android magus (Arc II) in our <em>Strength of Thousands</em> show, Outcast &amp; Outclassed. TTRPGs have given me a close-knit group of friends and a significant other that keep my head up and let me strive to do better in life.</p> 
                   <p>WafflesMapleSyrup strives to reduce the stigma against mental health with our platform in TTRPGs, and because of their similar standards, love to do so with Paizo. We've participated in PaizoCon streams, Jasper's Game Day, and Paizo events, among other events with various creators since we began.</p> 
                   <p>We aim to build our platform into something large enough to have the reach necessary to reduce the stigma against mental health and show that it is okay to be different, it's okay to be disabled, and there should always be a place for everyone at the table.</p> 
                   <br> 
                   <h3>Esther Wallace (she/her, zhe/zher)</h3> 
                   <p>Hi y’all, I’m Esther Wallace. I GM Chromythica, a Pathfinder 2E actual play, and I’m multiply disabled. I have myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), two types of OI (osteogenesis imperfecta, a rare bone disease, and orthostatic intolerance, which mostly means I get really dizzy when I stand up), and other as-yet-undiagnosed chronic illnesses. </p> 
                   <p>My disabilities come with frequent symptoms of brain fog, intense pain, and exhaustion. I’m still learning how to navigate as a disabled person in the tabletop community. Gaming spaces are so often not constructed with disabled people in mind; for me, it makes all the difference in the world if a GM and fellow players ask me about my access needs and work with me to implement accessibility practices. As a player, this can take the shape of GMs building in time for me to move my body or encouraging me to play online games from bed or a couch. As a GM, this frequently takes the form of my players helping me recall rules on particularly bad brain fog days! </p> 
                   <p>I created the hashtags #tabletopaccess and #ttrpgaccess as a way for disabled people to discuss our experiences in tabletop, and I host periodic Twitter chats about disability and tabletop RPGs using these hashtags. Disabled people are welcome to respond to any of the prompts I’ve posted, and nondisabled people are welcome to follow along and learn! </p> 
                   <p>You can find me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/dungeonminister">@dungeonminister</a> and catch me GMing @Chromythica on <a href="https://twitter.com/Chromythica">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZjsqJnhMtdH4Z-m_wzkz0w">YouTube</a>!</p>

                   <h3>Owen K.C. Stephens (he/him)</h3> 
                   <p>Hi, I’m Owen K.C. Stephens. I’ve been playing and homebrewing for TTRPGs for 39 years, been a professional game writer for 25 years, a developer for 21, and a publisher and consultant for 9. My involvement with Paizo goes back to the early days of the company putting out DragonMagazine. I wrote the original <em>Guide to Absalom</em> as a freelancer, was a Paizo developer on-staff from 2014 to 2019, am a co-creator of Starfinder, and have done regular freelance work for Paizo since I left. I am also the publisher and co-owner for Rogue Genius Games, and the <a href="https://greenroninstore.com/collections/fantasy-age">Fantasy AGE developer for Green Ronin</a>.</p> 
                   <p><b>Content Warning: Trauma, abuse, and suicidal thoughts discussed in the rest of this bio.</b></p> 
                   <p>I’m a survivor of childhood sexual abuse. I have Civilian Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (also known as Non-Combat PTSD) and Major Depressive Disorder. I must be medicated and undergo psychotherapy in order to remain functional. This is much like having a broken leg and needing crutches—the crutches don’t let you act normally, but they do make it possible to get more done than you possibly could without them.</p> 
                   <p>Gaming, both game-writing and game-playing, have been a major source of therapy and the ability to build a social safety net for myself. Before I was diagnosed, without RPGs, I would not have survived high school. I know games are important—they saved my life—and believe representation is a crucial part of that.</p> 
                   <p>You can find me and links to my social media at owenkcstephens.com.</p>

                   <p>One certainty for me in all of this is the community. No matter what, you're all out there playing games, having a good time and enjoying our stories, I've got the table data to prove it. It's exciting to know that the work we're doing is bringing some joy to your lives. I hope that this holiday season (for those of you who celebrate), you're able to get together with your biological and chosen families, as appropriate, and throw some dice together. You never know, Grandma might get really into playing Kyra from the <em>Pathfinder Beginner Box</em>! If you're looking for some festive cheer this season, definitely check out this month's new Starfinder Society release, A <em>Festive Operation</em>; I think it'll be a staple of December schedules for the next few years.</p>

                   <h2>Digital Adventure Releases</h2> 
                   <p>Here are this month's digital releases, available December 15, 2021:</p> 
                   <h3>Pathfinder</h3> 
                   <p><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02akp?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-306-Struck-by-Shadows">Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-06: Struck by Shadows</a>*<br> <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02akq?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-307-The-Locked-Lodge">Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-07: The Locked Lodge</a>*<br> <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02al1?Pathfinder-Bounty-17-Sodden-Stories">Pathfinder Bounty #17: Sodden Stories</a></p> 
                   <h3>Starfinder</h3> 
                   <p><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02aku?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-412-A-Festive-Operation">Starfinder Society Scenario #4-12: A Festive Operation</a>*</p> 
                   <p><em>*part of a subscription</em></p> 
                   <h2>Sanctioning</h2> 
                   <p>For those of you who have not already noticed, the <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/characteroptions">Pathfinder Society Character Options</a> page contains sanctioning for both <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq029xk?Pathfinder-Guns-Gears"><em>Guns &amp; Gears</em></a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027kc?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-The-Grand-Bazaar"><em>Lost Omens: The Grand Bazaar</em></a>! These two books had a lot of tricky elements, especially <em>Guns &amp; Gears</em>, and we're thankful for your patience while we sorted through them. I'd especially like to thank Linda Zayas-Palmer and Mark Seifter for spending a <em>lot</em> of time with me in the week before Thanksgiving working to get them out before the holiday, Pathfinders, go forth and enjoy your new content!</p> 
                   <p>For my fellow Starfinders, we've also sanctioned the most recent standalone adventure, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq029xs?Starfinder-Adventure-The-Liberation-of-Locus1"><em>The Liberation of Locus-1</em></a>, for credit, and its rules options are also available on the <a href="https://paizo.com/starfindersociety/characteroptions">Character Options page</a>. We hope you enjoy this new adventure!</p> 
                   <p>Looking forward, there are two Pathfinder rulebooks coming out in December: <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02aoy?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Monsters-of-Myth"><em>Lost Omens: Monsters of Myth</em></a> and the long-awaited <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02ap2?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Absalom-City-of-Lost-Omens"><em>Absalom, City of Lost Omens</em></a>. We hope to have the sanctioning for both of these ready for street date; they're a pretty light lift, so I'm very hopeful. On the Adventures front, we're also starting to work through the <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/strengthOfThousands"><em>Strength of Thousands Adventure Path</em></a>, and hope to have more to share on that soon.</p> 
                   <h2>Nova Update</h2> 
                   <p><a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shfs?Nova-Qualifications-Update">Last year, we announced</a> that we’d be adding one high-level scenario per year to the qualifying scenarios for Nova credit. We intended for this to be our end-of-year scenario each year; however, in looking at the plan for this year, the final scenario of the Data Scourge metaplot is (spoilers!) a 5-8, which is not quite high enough level to qualify for our requirements. As a result, we are adding the Nova tag to <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq029u3?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-409-Through-Sea-and-Storm"><b><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #4-09: Through Sea and Storm</em></b></a>. All previous and future runs (up to three) of this scenario will count towards the 10-scenario requirement for Nova qualification. Thanks to the VOs who pointed out this potential snag to me!</p> 
                   <h2>GM Recognition</h2> 
                   <p></p> 
                   <h2>Upcoming Conventions</h2> 
                   <h4>Campaign Service Coins</h4> 
                   <p>At SkålCon at the end of October, we awarded two new Campaign Service Coins. These Coins are given to volunteers who go above and beyond the typical volunteer duties to support their communities and Organized Play. Nominations are always accepted; volunteers may be nominated by emailing organizedplay@paizo.com with their name, region and a description of their service. As we begin to return to physical events, we hope to resume awarding these in-person, so letting us know what upcoming events they’re attending is also useful.</p> 
                   <p>Congratulations to:<br> <b>Aerine Caerwyn</b>, who now holds a Campaign Coin and Organized Play ID #850<br> <b>Sean Pearson</b>, who now holds a Campaign Coin and Organized Play ID #851</p> 
                   <p>It also came to my attention that we never formally announced the two recipients from last year’s SkålCon Online, so I would like to formally recognize:<br> <b>James Anderson</b>, who now holds a Campaign Coin and Organized Play ID #840<br> <b>Tineke Bolleman</b>, who now holds a Campaign Coin and Organized Play ID #841</p> 
                   <h4>GM Ranks</h4> 
                   <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the 5th milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios, as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains (program dependent). A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th milestone is 650 hours!</p> 
                   <p>This month, we had two GMs earn their fifth star for Pathfinder Society (first edition), and one GM earned their fifth nova for Starfinder Society.</p> 
                   <p><b>5th Star</b>: Idaho, Joshua Blazej<br> <b>5th Nova</b>: Hilary Moon Murphy</p> 
                   <p>Congratulations to our new 5-rank GMs, and thank you for your dedication! If you believe you have achieved your 5th rank but haven’t been announced, email us at organizedplay@paizo.com .</p> 
                   <p>Until next time - Explore! Report! Cooperate! And enjoy the holiday season!</p>

                   <p>You can also try the game directly on Tabletop Simulator on Steam. You need to have Tabletop installed, then <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2663893091">go to download the Pathfinder Arena demo</a> to add it to your games. Then run Tabletop Simulator and start fighting with your friends in the Arena! You can find a fast guide to the main Tabletop Simulator <a href="https://kb.tabletopsimulator.com/player-guides/basic-controls/">features here</a>. We have uploaded the rulebook, plus the summary cards. You will also find the ability tokens already in the bag, according to the number of players at the table. Mind that you will need to add the extra strength tokens according to the number of players.</p> 
                   <p><b>Backers who now join the campaign</b> already get Amiri, the barbarian, as an extra hero to play with, plus four extra monsters: the hobgoblin general (level 3), the ghoul (level 1), the young red dragon (level 4), and the onidoshi (level 4). </p> 
                   <p>The onidoshi can increase its total life points by 2 (as does the troll), and <b>it deals a strong damage output in both range and melee.</b> It’s also able to attack heroes twice if they’re in the range of both attacks (as does the ettin).</p> 
                   <p>The young red dragon is a fearsome opponent that can <b>attack at 360 degrees and ignore heroes’ defenses!</b> Players would be wise to plan very carefully when to strike against it!</p> 
                   <p>The hobgoblin general brings a new special ability to the game: when it deals critical damage, <b>the targeted hero is pushed up to two tiles away</b>. This effect can lead the opponents into other monsters' range to trigger even more attacks and score more glory points!</p> 
                   <p><b>The ghoul’s only attack is a melee attack, but it has the special ability to lower the number of your action points</b> and defense through negative tokens. This is particularly effective at the beginning of the game, when every hero has only 4 actions per turn.</p> 
                   <p>A custom 8-face die has also been unlocked, along with three extra cards per each hero’s deck, including expansions and unlocked stretch goals!</p> 
                   <p><b>Seelah is also waiting in the next stretch goal</b>. As soon as she’s unlocked, she will immediately get 3 extra cards too!</p> 
                   <p>We are also releasing three social stretch goals: like and follow the game on Board Game Geek to get new Shrine Tiles dedicated to Brigh, Nethys, Calistria, and Pharasma. Brigh allows you to rotate other tiles than the one your hero stands on; Nethys enhances your magic abilities, giving you an extra spell; Calistria rewards monster-hunter heroes with ability tokens; and Pharasma adds glory points if the hero has defeated a certain number of monsters at the end of the game.</p> 
                   <p><a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/326030/pathfinder-arena">Like and follow Pathfinder Arena on Board Game Geek to unlock them now!</a></p> 
                   <p>The other two social stretch goals concern our Facebook group. Invite new members or join it now to unlock another extra card for each hero and the miniature of the harpy, a new level-2 monster!</p>

                   <p>These print-on-demand versions differ from the originals only in that the inside covers have been printed as additional pages in the books’ interiors (and that some are now available as softcovers for the first time), and they will easily fill out gaps in any collector’s bookshelf.</p> 
                   <p>We have more titles in the works and will keep adding more as long as folks keep buying the ones we’ve got. Make sure to let us know in the comments what out-of-print titles you most want to see available as print-on-demand offerings, and we’ll set our priorities accordingly.</p>

                   <p>Every year we have several dozen events which support charities. We developed the charity boon programs to support these efforts. We’d like to recognize a few of the events who conducted charitable activities and supported the charities’ good works!</p>

                   <p><b>Defenders of the Healing Flame, August 21 &amp; November 6</b><br> With two charity streams and many shenanigans, the team raised $6,420 and threw one glitterbomb at the OPC.</p> 
                   <p><b>Gen Con Online, September 16-19</b><br> Gen Con auctioned off boons, signed books and embroidered items to support Take This and Trinity House, raising a total of $5,886!</p> 
                   <p><b>SkålCon 2021, October 29-31, Plymouth MN</b><br> In celebration of their first physical con since the pandemic began, the community raised $4,750 for Tubman, a local shelter, and collected physical goods to donate as well.</p> 
                   <p><b>PF2e Foundry Community for Extra Life 2021, November 6th</b><br> The Foundry developers’ streamed game on their platform raised $3,567 for Extra Life.</p> 
                   <p><b>Mace 2021, November 12-14, Charlotte NC</b><br> The North Carolina community came out and raised $2,800 for the North Carolina Zoo and $3,000 for Veteran’s Bridge Home.</p> 
                   <p>If we missed your event or you want to promote an upcoming charity event, please let us know in the comments! We know there are charity events year-round that deserve the attention.</p>

                  <blockquote> 
                   <p itemprop="description">“I don’t like the look of that <em>sloop</em>,” said Daker, punctuating the last word with his ever-present sneer.</p> 
                   <p>Callum extended his spyglass and directed it at the little vessel, a little less than two hundred feet to port. Its crew scurried about their duties as the sun reached for the golden edge of the western horizon.</p> 
                   <p>“A fisherman,” said Callum, still scanning the deck of the other vessel, “returning home. Not everyone’s a pirate, Gaius.”</p> 
                   <p>“We’re in the Shackles, Orrin,” answered Daker, still sneering at the smaller ship. “As far as I’m concerned, they’re all pirates, ‘til they prove otherwise.”</p> 
                   <p>They had the poopdeck of the <em>Madam Diabola</em> to themselves, a sleek Chelish warship armed with the latest in cannon technology, each devil-mouthed barrel etched with a magic sigil which promised every shot they fired would fly deadly and true. The <em>Madam</em> was given the honor of watching this insignificant settlement’s harbor while Admiral Lecarnas and the rest of the punitive fleet sailed off to lay siege to Drenchport that very morning. Callum didn’t even know the town’s name, but he also didn’t care.</p> 
                   <p>“I grant you, she’s a bold one,” Callum answered, watching as the sloop slowly moved in their direction. “Must’ve sailed out early morning, before we sealed the harbor. We could just warn her off with a hazard flag.”</p> 
                   <p>Gaius Daker was too bloodthirsty in Callum’s opinion, even if he was his oldest friend from his Fort Gorthoklek days. Too enthusiastic with the sap when leading a press gang, too ready to—</p> 
                   <p>“Fire a bit of iron across her bow with that pretty new swivel gun,” said Daker, eyeing the polished little cannon mounted on the port rail. “And beat to quarters. Lads and ladies need a bit of exercise, to keep ‘em on their toes.”</p> 
                   <p><em>Madam Diabola</em> was one of three vessels in the fleet outfitted with the new weapons, swivel guns similar to smaller versions of the black iron cannons on the decks below, tended by scurrying halfling prisoners the crew had taken to calling “powder rats.” Gaius Daker wanted to hear the cannon roar. Callum thought such impulse foolish. Would the captain approve of such actions?</p> 
                   <p>“Gaius,” began Callum, but swallowed the rest of his words when he caught Daker’s glare. He knew that look well. Daker was senior midshipman of the watch, and his words were no mere suggestion. That dark look made it an order.</p> 
                   <p>“Beat to quarters!” Callum shouted, turning to the swivel gun.</p> 
                   <p>Sailors across the vessel leapt into action and the sound of martial drums filled the air. Callum couldn’t help but admire the artistry of the little bronze cannon, mounted on the gunwale, its mouth fashioned like a dragon’s maw, fangs bent outward. He checked the breech, pleased to find it properly loaded and ready. Captain Hecata was fond of the lash, and her newly trained gun crews knew this better than most. They tended Madam’s newfangled weapons of war well, out of fear if not pride.</p> 
                   <p>The sloop was much closer now, turning to port so that it showed Madam her broad side. Callum, ready at the gunwale, turned to look at Gaius Daker, who he caught tugging at his officer’s jacket to sharpen the lines of his uniform.</p> 
                   <p>“They’re giving us a fat target, Gaius,” Callum said, a bit of pleading in his voice. “Maybe a signal flag’ll do the trick.”</p> 
                   <p>“A signal flag, Mister Callum?” came the lilting alto of Captain Hecata as she climbed up onto the poopdeck. “Perhaps I should prepare tea for these Shackles scum while you wave silk at them? What have we here, Mister Daker?”</p> 
                   <p>Gaius, eyes alight with bloodlust and just plan lust, grinned at the captain and saluted. </p> 
                   <p>“Suspicious vessel off the port, Captain! I ordered Midshipman Callum to fire a warning shot across her bow!”</p> 
                   <p>Callum grimaced. Just like Gaius to throw him overboard if it made him shine a bit brighter in Hecata’s emerald eyes. Daker offered the captain his spyglass and she took it, rewarding him with one of her unreadable smiles that could as easily portend divine preferment as utter doom. She looked through Daker’s brass device and within a heartbeat repeated the midshipman’s order.</p> 
                   <p>“Mister Callum, fire that shot. And I wouldn’t be cross with you if that shot puts a crimson part in someone’s hair.”</p> 
                   <p>Callum nodded and turned the swivel gun in the direction the sloop’s starboard bow. He angled the shot as low as he dared—Hecata might not care if he took off some poor bastard’s head, but he did. He asked a blessing from Abadar and fired the cannon. The shot ripped a hole low in the sloop’s staysail and a cry of fear washed across the space between the vessels, announcing the sloop crew’s shock.</p> 
                   <p>A woman in a long coat came to the starboard rail of the sloop, waving both arms frantically.</p> 
                   <p>“Ahoy, Chelish warship!” the woman cried, long brown locks freed as she added her hat to her call for mercy. “We’re honest fishermen, bringing a bellyful to our little island! See how low we ride?”</p> 
                   <p>Callum noted the ship was indeed running awfully low in the water.</p> 
                   <p>“You feed pirates then?” shouted Captain Hecata with a contemptuous air, hands on her hips.</p> 
                   <p>“Nay! Settlers, eking out a life in these hard islands! Shelly is a free port, and we give no allegiance to any pirate lord!”</p> 
                   <p>“Our intelligence says otherwise,” said the captain, and Callum saw she wore that same smile she had given to Gaius. Those fishermen had best say their prayers. It was clear now where this encounter was headed.</p> 
                   <p>Callum joined the naval academy in Hinji when it became clear his mercurial father would favor his younger brother when the inheritance was doled out. He had been fed tales of high adventure on the open seas, contending with the elements and wild creatures, bloodthirsty pirates and rebels intent on bringing Cheliax to its knees. Instead, he found himself part of an instrument of intimidation. Well-armed nautical bullies.</p> 
                   <p>“There are a dozen innocent souls on this ship, captain!” the brown-haired mariner in the sloop called out across the water. “We bring back the bounty of the sea to feed hungry bellies. Men, women, and children. No more, no less. I beg you let us pass!”</p> 
                   <p>The woman’s last words were made with hands clasped together, as if offering up a prayer.</p> 
                   <p>“Prepare to be boarded,” sang Captain Hecata, drawing her cutlass and nodding to Midshipman Daker, who wore a giddy grin on his face.</p> 
                   <p>Callum looked back at the sloop, the long-haired fisherwoman, hands still clasped like a supplicant…and then his eyes caught a shimmer, as though he looked at a painting behind glass, tilted to catch the sun’s rays. A warning tingled at the base of his spine. He turned to share his misgivings with the captain, when the unmistakable sound of a cannon report, several in fact, sent him instinctively to the deck, prostrate with his arms cradling his head. The first ball struck the portside railing on the quarterdeck below, obliterating wood and sending deadly splinters in all directions. The second tore through Gaius Daker, reducing him to an ugly spray of red.</p> 
                   <p>In the next moment Callum was helping the captain up from the deck, one side of her smart Chelish uniform painted with Daker’s blood. </p> 
                   <p>“Return fire!” she roared, shaking off Callum’s assistance. “By all the tines in Hell, that’s no bloody fisherman!”</p> 
                   <p>Callum glanced to his left—the sloop was gone. In its place was a black-sailed brigantine, the iron mouths of cannon protruding from open gun ports, its main deck alive with surly-looking sailors brandishing weapons.</p>

                   <p><em>Pirates!</em> he thought as <em>Madam Diabola’s</em> new guns answered the brigantine’s attack. But it was as if the wind took the iron hurled at their enemy away like fallen leaves. Of its sixteen guns, only a single cannonball connected with their chameleon foe. What sorcery did these brigands have at their disposal? Illusion to disguise a warship? Elemental servants to carry away iron shot? </p> 
                   <p>It was then that Callum caught sight of the brown-haired woman again. He could swear she was smiling at him directly, and as if to confirm it, she gave him a jovial wave and held her hands up to her mouth to trumpet her words across the now-smoky distance.</p> 
                   <p>“Welcome to the Shackles!” she cried.</p>

                   <br> 
                   <p><b>Moderator: I understand Beadle &amp; Grimm’s Pandemonium Warehouse is releasing its first ever premium Box edition of a Pathfinder Release. Why <em>Absalom, City of Lost Omens?</em></b></p> 
                   <p>Donk: Absalom is THE iconic city in Golarion. Plus there’s danger lurking around every corner, so lots of opportunity to make the characters’ lives miserable.</p> 
                   <p><b>M: Pre-sales of the Gold Edition begin on Black Friday, with 10% off to anyone who orders by Nov 28th. Did you have any say in that?</b></p> 
                   <p>[D]: Product doesn’t really talk to marketing. There’s a high wall, three moats, and pit traps filled with trolls between us and the marketing department. Our intradepartmental memos are stuffed in the mouths of junior VPs who are exchanged via catapult nightly. That said, I don’t disapprove. </p> 
                   <p><b>M: I’ve heard the Gold Edition comes with NPC cards that can hang on the GM screen, with artwork on the front for players and roleplaying info on the back for the GM. What kinds of NPCs might we expect?</b></p> 
                   <p>[D]: You’ll see all the most interesting denizens of Absalom: noble goblins, brave goblins, handsome goblins and brilliant goblins. Probably some other things, too, but I really haven’t checked.</p> 
                   <div class="blurbCenter">
                    <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/3ace3216-8c8a-4a16-880d-bb48c6b1bff8/BG_Absalom-mockup-cards-Location.jpg"><img style="max-width:70%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/3ace3216-8c8a-4a16-880d-bb48c6b1bff8/BG_Absalom-mockup-cards-Location.jpg" alt="Absalom building mock up cards with art on one side and information on the other"></a>
                   </div> 
                   <br> 
                   <p><b>M: It also comes with location cards. Artwork of the building or location on front, background information on the back. We’ve never seen that before from the Warehouse. Why now?</b></p> 
                   <p>[D]: Locations cards really help you understand where you are at all times. If you’re a member of the Pathfinder Society, that’s great for their motto of “Explore, Report, Cooperate”. And if you’re a member of the Bloody Barbers, it’s perfect for their motto of, “Bury the bodies further from the house.”</p> 
                   <p><b>M: I’m surprised a goblin would come up with wearable faction jewelry for players. What was your inspiration?</b></p> 
                   <p>[D]: We take special pride in our jewelry pieces. They’re designed by our crack jewelry designers, and lovingly crafted from the fillings ripped out of the teeth of marketing goblin project coordinators. Reduce, reuse, recycle, but without the reduce part—we call that “maximizing operational efficiency.”</p> 
                   <p><b>M: I see. So, you included several short bonus adventures in this Gold Edition. How do you expect GMs to use these?</b></p> 
                   <p>[D]: Our original design mandate for the bonus encounters was that they would be a short, sharp way to terrorize an adventuring party, complete with large battle maps to mark where the characters fell.</p> 
                   <p><b>M: Oh, so you also include large battle maps? </b></p> 
                   <p>[D]: Battles are more fun if you know where you are and what’s around you. After all, the difference in a five foot square is sometimes the difference between living to fight another day and your fellow party members looting your corpse.</p> 
                   <p><b>M: There’s quite a bit more that will come in the box that I saw on <a href="https://www.beadleandgrimms.com/pathfinder/absalom">beadleandgrimms.com/pathfinder/absalom</a>. How would you rate your website goblins?</b></p> 
                   <p>[D]: In general, our website goblins aren’t worth the cost of the oil to boil them. On the rare occasion that they actually manage to make the website work properly, we hold a party with floats and cake.</p> 
                   <p><b>M: Any last quote you’d like to leave our readers with? Words of wisdom?</b></p> 
                   <p>[D]: If you open your windows after sundown, and if the wind is blowing just right, you can hear the screams of the mighty warehouse engines coming to life. They’re ready—nay, eager—to build something great for the Pathfinder audience, and I think the product department has really knocked it out of the park. Assuming the website goblins can keep the site up and the marketing department doesn’t go berserk and start handing the boxes out with happy meals, we should be in for a good ride.</p>

                   <p><b>The campaign will feature a new expansion: Trap tiles.</b> Trap tiles substitute some of the Arena tiles and introduce a new way to score points. Will you be able to prove yourself worthy of their test, or will you fail? </p> 
                   <p>In Pathfinder Arena you will take the role of one of the iconic heroes of Pathfinder, trapped in a magical entity, calling itself “Arena”. The entity poses a challenge to the party: select a champion to claim the right to escape from it. <b>Score glory points by defeating the monsters summoned in the Arena, or by triggering beasts against your opponents!</b></p> 
                   <p>Players can modify the Arena structure by spending action points to push or rotate the tiles. By doing so, players can move opponents into a monster’s range and trigger an attack to score as many points as the damage the monsters inflict.</p> 
                   <p><b>Each hero has asymmetric abilities and a tailor-made deck, reflecting their class.</b> Heroes level up during the game by picking up tokens in the Arena to enhance their abilities and access to their deck. Choosing which cards to draft and which ability to prioritize enables players to develop different strategies in the Arena and makes each hero unique.</p>

                   </table> 
                   <p><b>Main Takeaways:</b>We tried something a little different from the conventional spellcaster model with the psychic’s lower number of spell slots and strong focus on …focus... cantrips, amps, and other special powers, with conventional slotted spells filling a more supplemental role. The overwhelming majority of you responded that you preferred this approach over a conventional spellcaster approach; however, much of the feedback also indicated that while what the psychic got in exchange for this reduced spell loadout was very interesting, it didn’t feel powerful or useful enough to make up for the difference in lost spell slots. So, a major direction of change for the psychic will be to retain the “fewer spell slots” and “cantrip/amp focus” class role, but adjust the power level of the supplemental pieces so that you can truly feel like you’ve unleashed the awesome power of your mind. I’ll get into some of the approaches we’re taking in each point below.</p> 
                   <p>We also wanted to get a sense in the playtest of what you all thought of the general tone and genre of the class. This was pretty conclusive—over two-thirds of respondents said the more magical cast was working for them, so we’ll be staying the course here as well!</p> 
                   <p><b>Spells and Spellcasting:</b> A strong majority of respondents stated that they preferred the playtest arrangement of the psychic’s spellcasting and key ability scores, so we’ll be sticking to those and keeping the psychic as a spontaneous occult spellcaster whose subconscious mind gives them a thematic choice of key ability score between Intelligence and Charisma.</p> 
                   <p>I also want to call out that, as with past spellcaster playtests, the specific spells granted on the conscious minds drew only on spells we had already published, so some needed to be chosen for role (“a damaging spell here” or “a scouting spell here”) and easy understandability even if they were a little outside the theme—for instance, <em>magic missile</em> was a stand-in for a more on-theme damaging level 1 spell on the distant grasp psychic. The final <em>Dark Archive</em> book will introduce several new spells with the psychic in mind for thematically tighter granted spells!</p> 
                   <p><b>Psyche:</b> The ability to unleash your psyche to amp spells for free was originally intended to let psychics really feel like they got to be masters of focus by cheating the Focus Point caps. However, the fact that psychics had almost unlimited Focus Points took up a lot of the power budget for the class, rippling into the psyches needing to come online later and have both benefits and drawbacks, as well as affecting the power of amps (which I'll touch on next). Therefore, one of the biggest changes we’ll be making to psychic is to remove this aspect of Unleash Psyche, and then redistribute that power through the rest of the class for a more consistent play experience. </p> 
                   <p>Consistent feedback also showed that while psyches were interesting when unleashed, most combats didn’t last long enough after the third turn to make getting into the psyche feel worthwhile (meaning that much of the psychic’s power was tied up in a feature they had inconsistent access to). While we don’t want to make Unleash Psyche an “assumed first-turn action” in the vein of Rage, Hunt Prey, or similar, we do want to make it easier to do. Thankfully, with the removal of psyche’s role as a source of unlimited Focus Points, we have a lot of options for making it more accessible, as well as for adding more punch, such as effects that happen when your first Unleash your Psyche, more special abilities that happen automatically when you are unleashed, or the ability to end your psyche earlier for a single big benefit.</p> 
                   <p><b>Amps:</b> Amps are one of the major parts of the psychic, and most respondents stated that they found these options very interesting—Mark tells me that amps scored among the highest for “interesting” of any class we’ve playtested—but also that they felt weak in comparison to normal focus spells. They were! Since Unleash Psyche meant that you could amp your focus cantrips 5 or more times in a single combat, as opposed to a hard maximum of 3, those amps needed to be a little under the balance point of spells like <em>fire ray</em>. While psychics will retain their focus on amps, they likely won’t have such an outsized number of them, so we have plenty of room to now bring the power scale of amps back up.</p> 
                   <p><b>New Stuff!:</b> Of course, we always increase the number of options between the playtest and the final class! In addition to the new spells that will be added in Dark Archive, the psychic will of course be gaining new feats and choices of both conscious and subconscious minds. In honor of our new iconic psychic, Thaleon, I’ll share his conscious mind, which is called the tangible dream. This path focuses on materializing and projecting the user’s thoughts into the physical world, allowing you to conjure walls, blades, and other constructs of force (or astral thread, or ectoplasm, as your character concept fits) around the battlefield!</p> 
                   <p>I’m getting a vision… It’s… of Mark, talking about the thaumaturge!</p>

                   <p>Hi everyone, Mark Seifter here for a post-playtest report for the thaumaturge class. I first want to thank you all for participating in the playtest by running and playing games, posting your playtest results and analysis, answering surveys, and having good discussions! In particular, the playtest was happening during a pretty challenging period for us at Paizo, and I appreciate how all of you in the playtest stepped up your game compared to earlier playtests with extremely civil discourse, keeping repetitive points to a minimum so I could keep up with all the new ideas, and just really engaging with each other’s ideas and feelings in good faith to talk about different directions. </p> 
                   <p>Overall, people really liked the thaumaturge, with a strong good feeling from the majority of players, but there were definitely some areas where it needed tweaking or rethinking, usually in a way that didn’t detract much for most playtesters but did in a big way for a small number of them. This left the thaumaturge in an interesting situation, with about as many people who were about as many huge fans of the class as the highest-ranking class we’ve ever playtested, but then that small number with especially low rankings. The great news about that is that it left a clear path forward. </p> 
                   <p><b>Main Takeaways:</b> The one thing I wasn’t sure about was whether playtesters would like our new vision of the thaumaturge or would prefer something more similar to the first edition occultist. What I discovered is that you really like the martial thaumaturge concept, by an overwhelming majority, and want it to remain a magpie picking up from all four traditions. However, there was a desire to make it clearer how the class fantasy works with respect to exerting your force of personality to convince the universe, as well as to add more capacity to the class’s skills so that Charisma-based skills are front and center to match the intro lore about being persuasive. The changes to Esoteric Antithesis and Find Flaws (see below) may help with this as well to allow better advantage of your Charisma key ability score, while freeing up a broader variety of character concepts—this will let players freely choose whether to lean more heavily on magical learning or more on making things up as you go along as best fits the character. We’ll also be making a variety of quality-of-life changes based on other playtester proposals.</p> 
                   <p><b>New Implements:</b> As the playtest mentioned, we’ll be adding up to nine implements (three each granting active, reactive, and passive abilities). Of the four new implements, one of them will be the tome (or a ledger, notebook, or similar object), a passive implement that mysteriously writes down information about everything around you to assist you. The other implements are one to let you inspire and lead your allies, one to debuff your enemies, and one that misleads your enemies’ attacks, but I’ll leave it up to you to figure out what implements those might be!</p> 
                   <p><b>Esoteric Antithesis and Find Flaws:</b> One thing I’ve learned from these playtests is that our playtesters tend to be our most dedicated and experienced players (and even if you’re new to Pathfinder, you are very experienced with tabletop RPGs in general). So, whenever even our most experienced playtesters think a mechanic is complicated, I think I should take another look at that. People loved the benefits for these abilities but thought they were complex, and that they sometimes had issues being tied directly to Recall Knowledge. Our plan is to disentangle Esoteric Antithesis from Recall Knowledge (with a feat, like investigators’, to pick up a free Recall Knowledge if you want that), instead just flat-out forcing your will on the universe with a check to establish a connection (I’m thinking a name like “Forge Connection”). One consequence of this is that even on a failure, you can forge a connection, but a success or critical success will give you more. Additionally, while a high majority of players really liked the playtest benefit from Esoteric Antithesis, there were some good ideas about how to open up to allow a variety of benefits to allow for more playstyles. So, we’re looking at offering multiple benefits a thaumaturge can pick from when you successfully forge a connection. This separates out the benefit where you apply a creature’s highest weakness and the benefit where you create a new weakness as two options, to handle the feedback people gave about situations where they were already applying a creature’s highest weakness due to preparation for the encounter. It also allows you to gain new benefits, for instance, when you might prefer a special buff or debuff instead of simply more damage. Right now, we’re toying with the idea of having a different connection for each implement, as some folks also thought implements could use one more unique power, and then have more connections available through feats</p> 
                   <p><b>Pacts:</b> People loved the story of the pacts—in fact, they wanted them to have stronger effects, and many wanted the option for any character, even non-thaumaturges, to gain them. We had actually planned on including similar pacts in a yet-unannounced part of the book, but based on your feedback, we also expanded the pacts into a full-on pact binder archetype for anyone to take! Opinions were pretty varied about their rarity, perhaps the most mixed we’ve ever gotten in a multiple choice question for paths moving forward, so we’ll take that into account moving forward.</p> 
                   <br clear="all"> 
                   <h2>A Glimpse, A Hunch, A Flicker of the Future:</h2> 
                   <p>Hey, thanks for sticking around! Here’s something coming up in <em>Dark Archive</em>—while the book is still in development and various things might change a little, I wanted to give a sneak peek into a new type of player option coming up in the cryptids file, one of the eight casefiles of the <em>Dark ArchiveM</em>.</p> 
                   <h3>Creature Echo Feats</h3> 
                   <p>Creature echoes are a new type of feat that grant you special powers based on exposure to an unusual creature. These are rare and usually only occur after a significant event involving the creature. Imagine a town where people have, one by one, begun to turn to stone. You might spend many months tracking down the cause of the phenomena, only to eventually find it was an ancient creature with a petrifying gaze living deep under the town. However your encounter with the creature goes, the following feat might echo with you if you survive:</p> 
                   <blockquote> 
                    <p><b>Stone Skin — Feat 12</b><br> Rare, Transmutation<br> <b>Prerequisites</b> You have been petrified.</p> 
                    <p>It might have been a medusa, dracolisk, or even a fossil golem; regardless of the source, you were the target of some petrifying effect, and an element of that stony gaze has remained with you, both protecting and slowly consuming you. Your limbs are coated with a layer of stone that rests atop your skin. You gain a stone fist unarmed attack which deals 1d8 bludgeoning damage, has the shove trait, and is in the brawling weapon group; unlike a normal fist, it does not have the agile or finesse traits. As your life force ebbs, this petrification spreads over more of your body to form a stony armor. When you have fewer than half your maximum Hit Points, your stone fist unarmed attack increases its weapon damage die from 1d8 to 1d10 and you gain resistance to physical damage equal to your Constitution modifier. </p> 
                    <p>If you would gain the dying condition, you can choose to instead be permanently petrified to avoid the risk of death. Counteracting this petrification requires a casting of <em>stone to flesh</em> of a spell level equal to at least half your level, as well as a counteract check against the hard DC for your level. Each time you recover from petrification caused in this way, you gain a new scar on your skin in the shape of a long, thin crack.</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">In early 2021, Toy Vault debuted two 1,000-piece jigsaw puzzle products featuring licensed art from Pathfinder. The initial two designs both featured the work of legendary fantasy artist Wayne Reynolds, who has produced breathtaking scenes of adventure and intrigue for Pathfinder since its inception nearly 20 years ago.</p> 
                   <p>The <em><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027jq?Pathfinder-1000-Piece-Puzzle-Core-Rulebook">Core Rulebook</a></em> design features iconic characters from the RPG, including Harsk the dwarven ranger, Merisiel the elven rogue, and Kyra the human cleric, all doing battle with a massive, fire-breathing dragon.</p>

                   <br> 
                   <p>Meanwhile, <em><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027jr?Pathfinder-1000-Piece-Puzzle-Bestiary">Bestiary</a></em> features some more of the fantasy world’s monstrous inhabitants, including three mischievous kobolds; an enraged ogre; and a giant, menacing hydra.</p>

                   </div> 
                   <p>When asked about his history with producing fantasy art like the imagery featured in these two puzzles, Reynolds said, “I have been working in the RPG industry for almost 30 years, with my first piece of art being featured in 1993.</p> 
                   <p>“I was working with Paizo when they took over Dragon and Dungeon Magazines,” Reynolds explained. “I was doing some cover art for them, so when they started Pathfinder, I was one of the first people they approached about providing art for the game.</p> 
                   <p>“It is exciting to be able to work on something from the ground level. My experience with Pathfinder has been massively enjoyable. I just love everything about that sort of world.”</p> 
                   <p>When asked about what pieces of art his personal favorites are to create, Reynolds said, “Mainly the iconic characters, as my specialty is in character design. I love being able to tie history to fantasy, and I always do a lot of historical research before beginning work on that type of a project.”</p> 
                   <p>Speaking specifically about his art being used to create jigsaw puzzle products, as well as how he thinks he’d fare putting them together himself, Reynolds said, “I like doing jigsaw puzzles. They are relaxing, and I think they also make for a good exercise as an artist. I am probably the wrong person to do a puzzle featuring my own artwork, though, because I already know the image so well.</p> 
                   <p>“I imagine it would be sort of like a musician dancing to their own music,” Reynolds added.</p> 
                   <p>Fans of Pathfinder, Wayne Reynolds, and fantasy art in general have made these jigsaw puzzle items two of Toy Vault’s most popular new offerings this year, and it is with great excitement that we announce two more brand new puzzles featuring Pathfinder imagery—<em>Gamemastery Guide and Gods &amp; Magic.</em></p> 
                   <p><em><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq0294z?Pathfinder-1000-Piece-Puzzle-Gamemastery-Guide">Gamemastery Guide</a></em> once again showcases a wonderful piece of Reynolds art, this time depicting Alaznist, one of the game’s villains, ascending a staircase while holding onto an impressive-looking spear-type weapon in one hand. Towering above her is a large black dragon with giant horns, red eyes, and wings extended.</p> 
                   <p><em><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02950?Pathfinder-1000-Piece-Puzzle-Gods-Magic">Gods &amp; Magic</a></em> features work by the talented Russian artist Ekaterina Burmak. The scene depicts the Starstone near the top, with three characters below. These three characters are Cayden Cailean, Iomedae, and Norgorber, all of whom ascended to godhood after touching the Starstone, according to official Pathfinder lore.</p> 
                   <p>These two all-new Pathfinder puzzles are available now, just in time for the 2021 holiday season. For more information on Toy Vault, please visit <a href="http://www.toyvault.com/" target="_blank">www.toyvault.com</a>.</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">“Please, Dhareen, must we go through with this? A bit of rock climbing is hardly a challenge for the Castrovel Kid!” Dhareen imagined her mentee thrusting his chest out proudly, thumb pressed triumphantly above his heart as he blustered several feet below her. She smiled to herself and pushed her piston-puncher into the mountain’s side, activating the gadget with a press of her lowleft thumb.</p> 
                   <p><em>Kuh-klank.</em></p> 
                   <p>“Perhaps, but it is custom among the tribes for a Yavnii to administer a test to every hopeful Brekai wanting to undergo the Test of the Mountain, and I am afraid that not even I have the authority to make exceptions to shobhad tradition. Not even for the ‘Castrovel Kid.’”</p> 
                   <p>“See, you say that, but I can hear your grin,” Vellero replied sullenly.</p> 
                   <p>“I know not what you mean.” Dhareen grinned again.</p> 
                   <p>Both gladiators fell silent as they climbed, Dhareen pausing her ascent long enough for Vellero to scale up alongside her.</p> 
                   <p><em>Kuh-klank.</em></p> 
                   <p>He had taken to her tutelage well. Ka’s cliffside was grueling even for an expert; twenty-two miles long and comprised of thin basalt overtop stronger metamorphic stone, careless climbers often plummeted to their deaths after relying on pistons pounded into brittle basalt. One of the many roles of a yavnii was to ensure their breknai did not succumb to such a fate. Vellero had learned Dhareen’s lessons well thus far, scaling around several patches of basalt she had left in his path as a test.</p> 
                   <p><em>Kuh-klank.</em></p> 
                   <p>Vellero’s concentration reminded Dhareen of when she first met the headstrong lashunta in the ring at Arl’s VitariTech Coliseum. They were competing in the Icons Grand Brawl, and he was favored to win. The young man was a crowd pleaser on a seven-match winning streak. He was good, but not good enough; Dhareen scrubbed the floor with her future friend’s face. Literally. Nevertheless, there had been a spark within Vellero, a spark that intrigued her. The second time she knocked him down—or perhaps the third—he clamored to his feet with a bruised antenna and a few chipped teeth, wiped fresh blood from his lip, and grinned.</p> 
                   <p>“Why do you persist?” Dhareen had asked, scarcely winded. “You cannot win. You bring yourself only pain. Throw your towel; others have when facing me. There is no shame in surrendering to your better.”</p> 
                   <p>“You’re right,” he’d replied. “But that wouldn’t be fair for the folks who came here to see me fight, and I don’t want to let a single person in this ring who believed that I could win down.” He raised his fists into a boxer’s stance, a pointless gesture against an opponent twice his size with twice as many fists. “When I go down, I want them to know I gave it my all!”</p> 
                   <p><em>Kuh-klank.</em></p> 
                   <p>“I don’t mean to sound indignant,” Vellero interrupted Dhareen’s thoughts. “I know that the Test of the Mountain is sacred to your people, and that it is an honor to be allowed to undergo it as an outsider.” </p> 
                   <p>Dhareen raised an eyebrow. “But?”</p> 
                   <p>“But,” Vellero took a breath. “Is the reason we’re doing this,” Vellero gestured out behind them, over red dunes and rolling clouds of dust. “Because you don’t think I can?”</p> 
                   <p>“If I didn’t think you could pass the Test of the Mountain, I wouldn’t have begun the climb with you, nor permitted you to undertake it.” Dhareen’s voice was gentle but her statement absolute. “The mountain is sacred to my people. We do not tolerate bloodshed on Ka. To send one who is unprepared up the Mountain is as shameful as slaying one’s enemies at its base.” </p> 
                   <p>Vellero’s expression softened slightly. “Thanks.”</p> 
                   <p>“Do not speak of it. You don’t want your throat to dry from the ascent.” </p> 
                   <p>Vellero blinked, then burst out laughing.</p> 
                   <p>“I don’t understand what you find so funny about that. You’ll have twenty miles left when we’ve reached the end of our shared path.” </p> 
                   <p>Vellero kept laughing for a minute, wiping tears from his eyes. “Thanks, Dhareen.”</p> 
                   <p>“You’re—”</p> 
                   <p><em>Kuh-<b>KUN.</b></em></p>

                    <h3>Dhareen reaches for a falling Vellero in this illustration by Victor Manuel Leza Moreno from <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027ud?Starfinder-Galaxy-Exploration-Manual">Starfinder: Galaxy Exploration Manual.</a></h3>
                   </div> 
                   <br> 
                   <p>Dhareen gave herself no time for thinking. Before the sound of shattering basalt reached her ears, before Ka itself folded like a withered tumblefern in a windstorm, she whipped around to where Vellero was climbing even as his cliffside shifted downward, a cascade of metamorphic stone tearing free from Ka and tumbling towards the ground below. Vellero screamed as he fell, but Dhareen plucked him from the air like a corpseheron snatching a leaping spookfish out from the Irkonian Sea. Dhareen didn’t speak Ysoki, but she had spent enough time around ratfolk gladiators at VitariTech to recognize the lashunta lambasting the situation with at least six of the fourteen different Ysoki swears that she knew.</p> 
                   <p>“Hold on, Vellero!” Climbing down wasn’t an option; a rockslide was eminent, and the best place to be during a rockslide was above it. Vellero was much smaller than she and less experienced at climbing, he would only slow them down. She could climbe faster with all four of her muscled arms free, anyway. There was only one option remaining. </p> 
                   <p>Hoisting the Castrovel Kid onto her shoulders like a mother giving a youngling a backride, she placed the much smaller lashunta onto her shoulders and started climbing as fast as she could, giving only the barest of warnings. “Hold tight!”</p> 
                   <p>Though Dhareen could hear Vellero shouting, her intense focus and the earsplitting sounds of portions of the rock wall sloughing off afforded her no opportunity to comprehend him. She climbed as quick as her body would allow, muscles aching and flaring as she abandoned her piston-punch and climbed barehanded. She knew full-well that the smallest mistake would send both she and her friend to their doom.</p> 
                   <p>Ten yards from the top.</p> 
                   <p>Five.</p> 
                   <p>She was going to make it.</p> 
                   <p>She and Vellero were going to make it.</p> 
                   <p>Then her world shook as shadow overtook her vision. A boulder dislodged from above, tumbling towards her, threatening to crack her skull and send Dhareen and her breknai tumbling miles to their death. She refused to close her eyes; she would greet the Lady of Graves with firsthand tales of how she died. She was not alone; at the peak of her vision, she saw a small lashunta arm, no bigger than that of a shobhad child’s, reach out as if to catch the boulder. Dhareen admired Vellero’s bravery one last time.</p> 
                   <p>The boulder collided with Vellero, and for a moment it was like watching a diver plunge into a serene pool. Vellero’s hand, then his arm, and then both their bodies plunged into the boulder. </p> 
                   <p><em>Was it just an illusion?</em></p> 
                   <p>Fine dust covered Dhareen as the boulder passed through her. From within, she watched the metamorphic rock splinter and crack in flight, first into smaller boulders, then into stone and pebbles, and finally into dust. The boulder never touched them; it dissolved before it even struck the Castrovel Kid’s hand.</p> 
                   <p>Dhareen was stunned at first. But with safety just a few yards above and Ka continuing to shake and splinter, the feeling passed quickly as she bellowed at her peculiar friend.</p> 
                   <p>“That, Vellero! Keep doing that!”</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">On the occasion of Transgender Awareness Week, we at Paizo want to reaffirm our support for our transgender colleagues, creators, and community members. We recognize that we've not always been there for our trans community members. While things are rough now, we as a company are dedicated to improving and providing a safe space for all gamers—especially trans gamers—to play, create, and be part of a thriving community where they are not only welcomed but celebrated.</p> 
                   <p>We felt that this year, we shouldn’t place additional emotional labor upon our trans staff, creators, and community to contribute to a blog for Trangender Awareness Week. Rather, we wanted to address the issue of transphobia on our forums.</p> 
                   <p>Many members of the community have noted a high amount of homophobic and transphobic posts recently. Let us be clear: these hateful posts are not okay under any circumstances, and those who make them will be faced with <b>permanent suspension</b> from the forums. Though our customer service department is doing their best to keep watch and address moderation flags, it’s clear that the volume of moderation needed on the forums in the last few months has meant that the team sometimes takes more time than usual to moderate a thread. </p> 
                   <p>Transphobia is serious and removing it from the forums should take precedence over other more routine moderation tasks. Therefore, if you need to report transphobia on the forums, please don’t hesitate to contact customer service directly by email at customer.service@paizo.com with INTOLERANCE in the subject line. Any such hate will be dealt with swiftly and incur a permanent suspension.</p> 
                   <p>While we realize that combatting discrimination is an ongoing process and this is only a small step, we hope that it can begin to make our community forums a place where all members of our community feel welcome, and more importantly, safe.</p> 
                   <p>Thank you to our trans community members and other allies who have pushed us to be better recently. We hear you, we value you, and we will continue to improve ourselves, our games, and our community to earn back the trust we’ve lost. It’s hard to admit that we haven’t been living up to our values, but it’s the right thing to do, and we can’t move forward without doing so.</p> 
                   <p>Please also consider donating to nonprofits benefiting and supporting the trans community—members of our staff recommend <a href="http://www.tgijp.org/" target="_blank">TGI Justice Project</a> and <a href="https://ingersollgendercenter.org/">Ingersoll Gender Center</a>, though there are many great organizations doing the work that would value your contribution.</p>
