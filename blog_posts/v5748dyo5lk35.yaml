  \ href=\"/pathfinderSociety\"><img src=\"/image/content/Logos/PathfinderSocietyLogo_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n   </div> \n   <h1 itemprop=\"headline\">Monthly Roundup!</h1> \n   <p class=\"\
  date\">Wednesday, August 30, 2017</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"> \n   \
  \ <p itemprop=\"description\">30 Arodus 4717</p> \n    <p>Back in the office after\
  \ an exciting Gen Con 50! We came, we saw, and played lots of Pathfinder Society\
  \ and Starfinder Society. The demo tables of Starfinder kept busy, with lines out\
  \ the door. Pathfinder Society packed the Sagamore Ballroom on Friday night to see\
  \ the debut of <a href=\"/products/btpy9tld?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-900-Assault-on-Absalom\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #9-00: Assault on Absalom</em></a>. We even added\
  \ a few extra tables to seat more players! Thanks to the Venture Officers, GMs and\
  \ HQ volunteers that made the event possible. We could not deliver the high level\
  \ of programming without your assistance.</p> \n    <p>If you attended Gen Con and\
  \ want to leave us feedback as we start planning 2018, please post in the official\
  \ feedback threads on the messageboards by <b>September 14th</b>. If you prefer\
  \ to give your feedback privately, please email <a href=\"mailto:genconpfsvolunteers@paizo.com\"\
  >genconpfsvolunteers@paizo.com</a>. The org play team, leads, and I are processing\
  \ all the information received to see where we can adjust processes and improve\
  \ the Gen Con 2018 attendee and volunteer experience.</p> \n    <h2>Quests</h2>\
  \ \n    <p>As we did with the <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lizf?So-Much-New-Material\"\
  >Silverhex Chronicles and Phantom Phenomena in July 2016</a>, from here on out,\
  \ the requirement to the Pathfinder Society Quest series Honor's Echo with pregenerated\
  \ iconic characters is rescinded. Any 1st level character may be used to complete\
  \ this arc. At this time, <a href=\"/products/btpy9qcb?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-816-House-of-Harmonious-Wisdom\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-16: House of Harmonious Wisdom</em></a> is considered\
  \ both a scenario and a series of Quests. If using as Quests to introduce players\
  \ to the Pathfinder Society, pregenerated iconic character use is highly suggested,\
  \ as this gets new players to the table and immersed in the game faster and easier.</p>\
  \ \n    <h2>Website Updates</h2> \n    <p>We updated the Faction Journal Cards for\
  \ the Year of Faction's Favor and they are now available <a href=\"/products/btpy9dgw?Pathfinder-Society-Faction-Journal-Cards\"\
  >for download</a>. Our content management liaison is still working on getting other\
  \ items up on paizo.com, such as the Starfinder Society pages. Until this happens,\
  \ we've stickied several posts in the Organized Play messageboards with links and\
  \ updated policies, to keep the org play machine running smoothly.</p> \n    <h2>Campaign\
  \ Coin Recipients</h2> \n    <p>During my travels, I've had the opportunity to give\
  \ out campaign coins at events other than PaizoCon and Gen Con. This led to my only\
  \ awarding one at Gen Con. Please congratulate <b>Glen Shackleton</b> on his long\
  \ service to our community. He is now Org Play number 783.</p> \n    <h2>5* GM Recognition</h2>\
  \ \n    <p>With so many special scenarios running at Gen Con, many GMs ran the last\
  \ of their required 10 special games and achieved their 5th star. Besides 10 special\
  \ events, they need to 150 games, including at least 50 unique scenarios. Our dedicated\
  \ GMs spend hours and hours preparing to deliver a quality experience to the players.\
  \ To those listed below, who earned their 5th star in the past few weeks, welcome\
  \ to the club and thank you for your dedication to our Society.</p> \n    <blockquote>\
  \ \n     <p>Hunter Balduf<br> Danny Braddock<br> William Cleveland<br> Joe Ducey<br>\
  \ Doug Edwards<br> Matthew Hudson<br> Tom Mcqueen<br> Zack Nagel<br> Jeffrey Reed<br>\
  \ Glen Shackleton<br> Roger Sidebotham</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <h2>Conventions</h2>\
  \ \n    <p>Over the past few months, we feature the upcoming conventions with organized\
  \ play activities. This list generates from the convention organizers' requesting\
  \ support from Paizo and may not be complete. Especially when a flood of requests\
  \ arrives in my inbox or when I am travelling.</p> \n    <p>The question I have\
  \ for our player base—does this list help? Do you want me to continue posting events?\
  \ If you would prefer to have it in a different format, or at a different time,\
  \ please let me know. Constructive feedback is always appreciated!</p> \n    <div\

  \    <p><b>Today </b>is the deadline for the <b>Leaders in Liberty</b> contest.\
  \ All entries must reach us by <b>midnight</b> Pacific Time. For more information,\
  \ check out <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ljz1?Leaders-in-Liberty\">the contest\
  \ criteria blog</a>.</p> \n    <p>In August, we noted that our next competition\
  \ would be for best terrain. So dig through your photos and get ready to send us\
  \ your best one. We'll start accepting them <b>September 1st</b> and stop on <b>September\
  \ 21st</b>. So if you haven't built something yet, you still have time.</p> \n \
  \   <p>The contest requirements are that the photo be of a piece of 3D terrain made\
  \ by the submitter in the last 6 months. Once submissions are closed, we will review\
  \ the photos, pick the top contenders, and post them on paizo.com for a community\
  \ vote. The winner will receive $30 in store credit. The number and value of prizes\
  \ for runners up will be based on the number of submissions received and will be\
  \ posted at the time of voting.</p> \n    <p>The next few weeks should be a flurry\
  \ of Venture-Officer additions, convention support processing, and planning meetings\
  \ for Seasons 10/5/2. Three programs mean triple the planning and lots of coordination.\
  \ I am not travelling again, until October, so now's the time to pull things together.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The next Paizo attended show is PAX Unplugged in November. We should\
  \ have more information in the next few weeks regarding our presence at the show.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Until next week—Explore, Report, Cooperate!</p> \n    <p>Tonya Woldridge<br>\
