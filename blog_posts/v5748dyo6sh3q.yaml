  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Tynea Halix Gi Satultir\
  \ sat in a private booth with a one-way window that overlooked the busy high street\
  \ of Paradise Village and read the latest electronic dispatch from the captain.\
  \ It was nothing new: an agricultural report stating crop yields were high, an editorial\
  \ on how the latest Pact Council decision would affect <i>Idari</i> citizens, and\
  \ an empty promise to crack down on crime in the Red Corridors. Tynea stretched\
  \ his two upper arms and stirred his drink.</p> \n     <p>A shadow suddenly loomed\
  \ over him. Tynea quickly reached for a bandana to cover his mouth but stopped when\
  \ he heard the voice.</p> \n     <p>“You know, tradition doesn’t mean you have to\
  \ visit the same café every single day.”</p> \n     <p>“I just so happen to like\
  \ their coffee,” Tynea replied, demurely taking a sip.</p> \n     <p>The figure\
  \ took the chair across from him. He was a tall and fit kasatha, his skin a powder\
  \ blue with dark gray markings running up the side of his head. His black eyes shone\
  \ with mischief. He ceremoniously removed his fashionable face mask and placed it\
  \ next to Tynea’s bandana. He tapped a few times on the table’s ordering system,\
  \ and within moments a server drone brought in a piece of crownberry pie with a\
  \ dollop of fresh cream.</p> \n     <p>And though it had been almost a year since\
  \ Tynea saw him last, Rudim Jinska Viaz Marodi hadn’t changed one bit. </p> \n \
  \    <p>“You’re back,” Tynea said.</p> \n     <p>“I’m back.”</p> \n     <p>“For\
  \ how long?”</p> \n     <p>“For now.”</p> \n     <p>Tynea felt his cheeks grow hot.\
  \ “Until the Starfinder Society needs you again, I suppose. And then you’ll disappear\
  \ for months on end without a single communication, while we—your friends, your\
  \ family, <i>me</i>—worry ourselves sick.” He downed the rest of his coffee, the\
  \ nearly scalding liquid a distraction from the lump forming in his throat.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Rudim looked up from his plate. “Don’t be like this, Tiny. I’m sorr—\
  ”</p> \n     <p>“Don’t call me that!” Tynea pushed away from the table, snatched\
  \ up his purple bandana, stood up, and marched out into the crowd.</p> \n     <div\

  \ \n     </div> \n     <p>Minutes later, Rudim caught up with him outside of an\
  \ antique shop, traditional Kasath blades displayed in the window against a velvet\
  \ backdrop. They caught each other’s glances in the reflection of the transparent\
  \ aluminum, as Rudim gently placed a hand on Tynea’s shoulder.</p> \n     <p>“You\
  \ have every right to be mad at me, Tynea. In fact, if you want to take a swing\
  \ at me with one of those, you should.” Rudim gestured at a long, serrated sword.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“I’d just as likely cut off one of my own arms,” Tynea mumbled.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Rudim chuckled and squeezed softly. “I’ve missed you. So much. And I’\
  m sorry for what I’ve put you through.” He reached into one of his pockets and extracted\
  \ a pair of shining plastic cards embossed with holography. “I know this couldn’\
  t begin to make it up to you, but what are you doing tonight?”</p> \n     <p>Tynea\
  \ turned around. “Are those…?”</p> \n     <p>\"Yup, two tickets to tonight’s Culinarium\
  \ banquet, the exclusive thrice-annual event where the <i>Idari’s</i> finest experimental\
  \ chefs showcase their latest recipes!” Rudim puffed out his chest.</p> \n     <p>“\
  But how? They always sell out in minutes.”</p> \n     <p>Rudim winked. “Being a\
  \ member of the Starfinder Society has its occasional perks.”</p> \n     <p>Tynea’\
  s shoulders fell. “Rudim, be honest. Is this part of some mission?”</p> \n     <p>“\
  No! Well… not completely. I just have to ask one of the chefs a few questions about\
  \ some rumors that she’s been acting a little strangely, and that’s it. The rest\
  \ of the night will be just for us.”</p> \n     <p>Tynea sighed. “Promise?”</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“I promise.”</p> \n     <hr> \n     <br> \n     <p>“Damn it, Rudim,\
  \ this is not the night I was expecting!”</p> \n     <p>The machine—a 2-foot cube\
  \ of metal plates, wires, and crystals—shuddered with arcane energy, as Tynea stood\
  \ before it, panic and confusion in his eyes. Behind him, Rudim struggled against\
  \ a kasatha chef, grabbing at her apron, which promptly slipped off.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>“Hurry!” Rudim shouted. A bolt of magic arced from the machine and struck a\
  \ row of kitchen knives attached to two long magnets on the wall, turning them into\
  \ rock candy. They fell onto the counter and shattered.</p> \n     <p>“I don’t know\
  \ the first thing about magic!” Tynea yelled back.</p> \n     <p>“Then just hit\
  \ it with a frying pan or something!”</p> \n     <p>“No!” the chef bellowed. Her\
  \ form then began to melt like ice cream on a hot day. Surprised, Rudim let go and\
  \ stepped back. The chef’s arms and legs elongated, becoming starfish-like appendages\
  \ with a single eye on each joint. Her face softened and disappeared, and her voice\
  \ gurgled from an orifice in her chest. “My masterpiece!”</p> \n     <p>Tynea had\
  \ found a large cast iron skillet and raised it over his head. Another shaft of\
  \ energy lanced out from the device, and Tynea brought the utensil down with a grunt.\
  \ Pieces of pan-shaped chocolate scattered across the floor. “Damn,” he muttered.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Meanwhile, Rudim redoubled his efforts to capture the shapeshifting\
  \ chef. While she was distracted by Tynea, he swept his leg out in a practiced move\
  \ and sent her tumbling to the floor. Using all four arms, he pinned down most of\
  \ her tentacles. “Ok, astrazoan, what is this thing? And what did you do with the\
  \ real Chef Gou?”</p> \n     <p>A wet laugh bubbled up from the astrazoan. “There\
  \ never was a real Gou, you fool. She was always me. And I’ve spent the past decade\
  \ being overlooked by my so-called betters! But no longer! They’ll see my genius,\
  \ right before my molecular comestiblizer turns them into piles of pastries! And\
  \ then I’ll have my sweet revenge!”</p> \n     <p>Rudim knocked the astrazoan out\
  \ with a single punch and stood up. Without looking away from the cabinet he was\
  \ searching, Tynea said, “I swear, if you say something about ‘just desserts’ right\
  \ now, I will find another skillet to brain you with.”</p> \n     <p>“Why are you\
  \ taking the fun out of this?”</p> \n     <p>“Fun?!” Tynea yelled as an arc of energy\
  \ transformed a portion of the ceiling into dripping jelly. “You think this is fun?!\
  \ Aha!” He pulled a roll of shiny foil from the cabinet. “Never mind. Don’t answer\
  \ that. I have an idea.” Tynea cautiously approached the sputtering cube, and moments\
  \ later had it wrapped in the material. The device shook one last time and then\
  \ was quiet. Tynea carefully peeled away a portion of the covering to reveal an\
  \ elaborately decorated layer cake.</p> \n     <p>Rudim chortled. “Reflective foil!\
  \ Genius!” He warmly embraced Tynea, who finally relaxed.</p> \n     <p>“I suppose…\
  \ that was a little thrilling.” Tynea looked up into Rudim’s eyes. “Perhaps you\
  \ could teach me that leg sweep?”</p> \n     <p>Rudim reached behind Tynea, swiped\
  \ a finger of icing from the cake, and smeared it onto Tynea’s forehead. “Does that\
  \ mean you want to do this again?”</p> \n     <p>“Maybe,” Tynea said coyly. Wiping\
  \ the icing from his face, he licked it from his hand and then gagged. “But first\
  \ let’s get a drink. That might be a cake but it still tastes like metal.”</p> \n\
