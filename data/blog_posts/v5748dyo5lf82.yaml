  \     <p><span itemprop=\"description\">Gen Con was a blast, and I was happy to\
  \ hear that most of the feedback from Season 5 has been very positive. As you've\
  \ heard me say (or at least seen me write) before, there's a lot more in store for\
  \ the season, and I'm very excited to see how it plays out with your feedback in-game\
  \ and out.</span></p> \n     <p>Sadly, it's a long, lonely stretch of time between\
  \ Gen Con—when we released three new scenarios, a Special, five new Beginner Box\
  \ demos, and the next installment of The Ruins of Bonekeep—and the release of the\
  \ September scenarios. It's also a very welcome stretch of relative calm following\
  \ approximately two and a half months of massive deadlines, but I want to ensure\
  \ that there are plenty of options for Pathfinder Society Organized Play as I catch\
  \ up on emails, assign new projects, and take some time to assess where to take\
  \ the campaign next.</p> \n     <p>As homage to the extensive traveling during convention\
  \ season, the Jade Regent Adventure Path—in which the PCs travel quite a bit—is\
  \ now sanctioned for organized play. A download containing the rules for running\
  \ the Adventure Path for Pathfinder Society is available on the <a href=\"http://paizo.com/pathfinderSociety/about/additionalResources\"\
  >Additional Resources page</a>.</p> \n     <p>As an aside to those who are wondering\
  \ about a different adventure that also involves one or more dragons and a green\
  \ cover, yep, that's still on its way.</p> \n     <p>Happy gaming,<br> John Compton<br>\
