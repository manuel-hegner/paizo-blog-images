  \ Week 1 Advice</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, December 17, 2013</p> \n  \
  \ <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p>Hello and welcome again to RPG Superstar\
  \ 2014! I'm Sean K Reynolds, host of this year's RPG Superstar competition, designer\
  \ at Paizo, and a judge for the previous four RPG Superstar competitions.</p> \n\
  \    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">So far after a full week since the Round\
  \ 1 submission period started, we have about 200 wondrous items in the hopper, which\
  \ is about on par for previous years. Given that we usually have a surge of entries\
  \ at the start and end of the Round 1 open call, I expect we'll have about as many\
  \ wondrous items this year as we did last year. Here's some quick advice for everyone\
  \ who hasn't submitted an item yet.</span></p> \n    <ol>\n     <li>When I was an\
  \ RPG Superstar judge, I wrote a series of long posts about \"design traps\" you\
  \ should avoid when designing your wondrous item submission. Although I'm not a\
  \ judge this year, the public voters and the official judges are aware of these\
  \ \"traps,\" so I suggest you <a href=\"/threads/rzs2p83c\">read about each of them</a>.</li>\
  \ \n     <li>Remember to use the standard magic item stat block format presented\
  \ in the <i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i>. The submission tool uses the message\
  \ board interface, so you can use [b][/b] for bold and [i][/i] for italics. The\
  \ <a href=\"/rpgsuperstar/round1Rules\">Round 1 rules</a> actually include a properly-formatted\
  \ magic item stat block template—you can save yourself a lot of work by copying\
  \ it to your favorite word processing program, writing your item into template,\
  \ and (when you're 100% ready to submit it) paste it into the submission form. Just\
  \ remember to hit the Preview button to see how it looks, and only hit Submit Post\
  \ when you're sure it looks right!</li> \n     <li>Don't let your inexperience talk\
  \ you out of submitting an item. We've had people as young as age 9 make it into\
  \ the Top 32, and people who've never played Pathfinder before. Give it a shot!</li>\n\
  \    </ol> \n    <p>Also, last year, about 5% of the items submitted to the competition\
  \ were by women (based on the gender info the author provided in the Paizo.com message\
  \ board profiles). I'd really like to see that number go WAY up! RPG gaming has\
  \ been a male-dominated hobby for a long time, but in my 18 years in the game industry\
  \ I've seen a steady increase in the number of lady gamers. If you are female, or\
  \ know any ladies in or outside your gaming group, please encourage them to create\
  \ a wondrous item and submit it to RPG Superstar this year. Of course, feel free\
  \ to encourage any gamers you know to write something for the competition, too!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Remember, the deadline to submit your item is January 1, 2014 at 2 PM\
  \ Pacific time! Open voting for all Round 1 items begins immediately after the submission\
  \ deadline.</p> \n    <p>Thanks, and good luck!</p> \n    <p>Sean K Reynolds<br>\
