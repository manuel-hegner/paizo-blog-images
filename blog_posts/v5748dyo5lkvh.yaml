  \ </div> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">As I write this, I'm deeply wrapped up\
  \ in design and development on the next major version of the Pathfinder Adventure\
  \ Card Game—the new PACG <i>Core Set</i> and the <i>Curse of the Crimson Throne\
  \ Adventure Path</i>. And while I'll be talking a lot about those in the weeks to\
  \ come, this seemed like an appropriate time to look at the Ultimate decks, since\
  \ in some ways they're both the oldest and the youngest PACG expansion material.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Once upon a time, we were putting together the very first Adventure Path.\
  \ Then, as now, we were deep in development and testing, and it became clear to\
  \ us that if you all liked the game, we'd be making more someday: more Adventure\
  \ Paths, more characters, more everything. During a conversation about possible\
  \ next steps, I pitched to Paizo's Publisher Erik Mona the idea of PACG products\
  \ built around the expansions to the <i>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game <a href=\"/products/btpy88yj\"\
  >Core Rulebook</a></i>—specifically, <i><a href=\"/products/btpy8mcz\">Ultimate\
  \ Combat</a></i>, <i><a href=\"/products/btpy8k8r\">Ultimate Magic</a></i>, and\
  \ <i><a href=\"/products/btpy8tmc\">Ultimate Equipment</a></i>; the <i><a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8fo1\">Advanced Player's Guide</a></i>; and the Bestiaries. It seemed\
  \ like a natural fit. We bandied about some ideas, and then got back to work on\
  \ Rise of the Runelords, then Skull &amp; Shackles, Class Decks, and so on.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Fast forward a few years, a few Adventure Paths, and a few (okay, <i>27</i>)\
  \ Class Decks. We were already looking ahead to a potential revision of the game—\
  not a new game, but a chance to clean, clarify, and streamline various bumps and\
  \ corners. This was to be a big project, and in the meantime, there were issues\
  \ that we wanted to address. Iconics both old and new had yet to officially appear\
  \ in PACG, and several seasons of organized play had turned some seams and imperfections\
  \ in the existing class decks into cracks. (To be clear, I intend no disrespect\
  \ to the class decks! As a developer, there are always \"seams and imperfections\"\
  , and the earliest class decks were built as well as we knew how, but with very\
  \ little real data to go on.) So it was that, looking at new-ish concerns and expecting\
  \ potentially large new changes on the horizon, we turned to the old idea of decks\
  \ based on Pathfinder RPG expansion material, and added a new twist: these decks\
  \ could also be added to existing class decks. This set would also give us a chance\
  \ to try out some ideas we had for the upcoming <i>Core Set</i>. As it had when\
  \ talking to Erik and Vic way back when, it seemed like a natural fit.</p> \n  \
  \  <p>Anyone familiar with the Ultimate books knows that they're not all created\
  \ equal. Each focuses on a different area, with plenty of room for overlap. In this\
  \ month's <i><a href=\"/products/btpy9x03\">Ultimate Equipment Add-On Deck</a></i>,\
  \ we wanted very broad coverage—a deck that could be useful and interesting when\
  \ combined with a very wide range of characters—ideally, for anyone who cares about\
  \ having just the right tool for the job, regardless of the job. To that end, the\
  \ cards in <i>Ultimate Equipment</i> focus not on the how or the why, but the <i>what</i>.\
  \ In other words, it's all about the <i>stuff</i>.</p> \n    <p>For your blog-viewing\
  \ and card-playing pleasure, we have…</p> \n    <p>...stuff for breaking things\
