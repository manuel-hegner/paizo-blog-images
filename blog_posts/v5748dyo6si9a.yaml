  \ We’ve also had some new additions to the team (and more to come, so stick around\

  \  <h3>Jason Bulmahn</h3> \n      <p>Hello everyone, I am Jason Bulmahn and I am\
  \ the Director of Game Design at Paizo, in charge of the entire Rules and Lore team.\
  \ I first got my start with Paizo back in 2004 as the Managing Editor of Dragon\
  \ magazine but then served as the Lead Designer for the first edition of the Pathfinder\
  \ RPG. Today, I work on setting the goals and design objectives of our games, envision\
  \ major projects that won’t even be announced for several years, coordinate game\
  \ ideas with our partners, and work to ensure that the team has everything they\
  \ need to succeed.</p> \n      <p>At night, I leave behind my guise as a mild-mannered\
  \ game designer and turn into… yet another game designer, working on my own Pathfinder\
  \ 2E setting called Eventide. I also tinker with other games under the name Minotaur\
  \ Games, creating a zombie apocalypse hack of Pathfinder 2E called Hopefinder. You\
  \ can find me streaming Wrath of the Righteous most Tuesday nights on Twitch and\
  \ playing other games on Saturday afternoons (<a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/JasonBulmahn\"\
  ><b>twitch.tv/JasonBulmahn</b></a>). I can be found on almost every social media\
  \ platform (just search for Jason Bulmahn), but I am most active on twitter <a href=\"\
  https://twitter.com/JasonBulmahn\">@JasonBulmahn</a>.</p> \n      <br> \n      <h3>Michael\
  \ Sayre</h3> \n      <p>We meet again! I’m Michael Sayre, the Design Manager for\
  \ the Rules &amp; Lore team. My direct reports include Creative Director Luis Loza,\
  \ Senior Designer James Case, Senior Developer Eleanor Ferron, and Developer Landon\
  \ Winkler. I coordinate between them, our Lead Designer Logan Bonner, and the other\
  \ teams in and beyond the creative department to plan and facilitate the creation\
  \ of hardcover rulebooks, Lost Omens books, and a variety of other product types.\
  \ I also do design and development work, leading and writing for those same books.\
  \ You can follow me on Twitter as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MichaelJSayre1\"\

  \      <p>Hello, out there! I’m Logan Bonner, the Pathfinder Lead Designer. That\
  \ means I’m on overwatch for the game rules as a whole, looking for opportunities\
  \ to introduce new systems and options and to make sure they come out at a pace\
  \ that’s neither too slow to be exciting nor so fast it overwhelms folks and makes\
  \ it too hard to keep up. Also, to make sure all the pieces fit together well. Rules\
  \ sustainability and consistency, basically. One of our big goals with Second Edition\
  \ was to give the books in our Rulebook line a better grounding in the lore of the\
  \ world, and people have been really enjoying all we’ve added to make their characters\
  \ and games feel more immersive. I’m looking forward to this new team structure,\
  \ which will let us blend the story, world, and rules in more fun ways.</p> \n \
  \     <p>You can find me on Twitter, where I’m <a href=\"https://twitter.com/loganbonner\"\

  \ \n      <p>Hi, everyone! I'm Luis Loza, Creative Director for the Rules &amp;\
  \ Lore team. You might now my work from helping create the Lost Omens line of settings\
  \ book, and I'm going to continue helping shepherd the setting as Creative Director.\
  \ I look forward to some of the exciting events we have planned in the future of\
  \ the Lost Omens setting and I hope you'll enjoy the ride! I live on a variety of\
  \ places online, but the easiest spots to find me are on my twitter account (<a\
  \ href=\"https://twitter.com/donatoclassic\">@donatoclassic</a>) and my personal\

  \ I work on the Lost Omens line with Luis Loza to bring the world and setting of\
  \ Golarion to life!</p> \n      <br> \n      <h3>Landon Winkler (they/them)</h3>\
  \ \n      <p>Hi, I’m Landon Winkler, a Developer on the Rules &amp; Lore team. I’\
  m new to the team, so still very much learning the ropes. Mostly, I just want to\
  \ create fun creatures and other bits of stories for everyone to use. I love playing\
  \ support, so getting these things polished up for your table is a great way to\
  \ do that behind the scenes. On the off chance you need to get in touch with me,\
  \ I can be reached at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/landonwinkler\"><b>@landonwinkler</b></a>\

  \ width=\"75%\">\n      </center> \n      <br> \n      <p>If you’re interested in\
  \ joining this team, we’ve actually opened up two new positions! We’re looking to\
  \ hire one new designer and one new developer for the team, whose responsibilities\
  \ will be in helping us plan and create the new content produced by the Rules &amp;\
  \ Lore team. While industry experience is strongly preferred for people interested\
  \ in these positions, these are not intended to be senior positions, and we do have\
  \ room for talented and interested parties who are earlier in their TTRPG careers\
  \ and might have great ideas but need a little more training and experience. You\
  \ can see the specific requirements of these positions <a href=\"https://paizo.com/paizo/careers\"\
