  \ <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\">In July, we terminated Paizo’\
  s longstanding Community Use Policy and replaced it with a new Fan Content Policy.\
  \ This was an error, and we’re taking steps to rectify that today.</p>\n      <p>We\
  \ are reinstating the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/licenses/communityuse\">Community\
  \ Use Policy as it has existed for over 15 years</a>, with a few minor updates and\
  \ clarifications intended to make using the policy even easier. We have removed\
  \ both the Approved Products List and Community Use Registry and clarified some\
  \ elements that were previously in FAQs or simply not addressed (like being able\
  \ to use our art and logos in black and white products). We have not changed the\
  \ permissions granted by the policy. The specific language in the Community Use\
  \ Policy declaration you need to include in your project has changed to reflect\
  \ a new URL for the policy on <strong>paizo.com</strong>, and we have added the\
  \ provision that you provide contact information somewhere on your product in lieu\
  \ of the now-removed registry. This change will allow existing Community Use Policy\
  \ projects to continue to operate as they have for over a decade.</p>\n      <p>We\
  \ still fully intend to provide additional permissions for community creators to\
  \ monetize their creations under limited circumstances. For the time being, <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/licenses/fancontent\">the Fan Content Policy</a> allows this,\
  \ and we’re making no changes to that policy today—it exists alongside the Community\
  \ Use Policy. With the Community Use Policy restored, we can refine the Fan Content\
  \ Policy to more clearly define what commercial uses are allowed under what conditions\
  \ and using which elements of our intellectual property. We will make our intended\
  \ revisions and updates to the Fan Content Policy and let the community know when\
  \ the new version is available.</p>\n      <p>Paizo’s community is the foundation\
  \ of our success, and we deeply appreciate all of the hard work and passion you\
  \ bring to our spaces. We apologize for this misstep and look forward to a long,\
  \ bright future for community projects inspired by our work. Thank you for all of\
  \ your outreach, feedback, and difficult conversations throughout this process.\
  \ And above all, thank you for being a part of our community.</p>\n     </blockquote>\n\
