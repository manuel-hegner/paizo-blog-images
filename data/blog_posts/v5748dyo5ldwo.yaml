  \     <p>First, I want to thank JP Chapleau for his tremendous efforts in building\
  \ the Denver area Pathfinder Society. Not only was he the caretaker of Denver, but\
  \ he oversaw Pathfinder Society in all of Colorado and expanded into parts of New\
  \ Mexico and Idaho. He has taken a position as Creative Director for Neo Exodus\
  \ and will be building the organized play program for that game. I wish him the\
  \ best and look forward to watching the growth of Neo Exodus organized play. Taking\
  \ over in Colorado is Venture-Captain Jacque Woods. She comes into the position\
  \ extremely motivated to continue the awesome job that JP did where he left off.\
  \ She mentioned she was looking to centralize all Pathfinder Society activity into\
  \ a website to help foster a greater sense of community and I look forward to seeing\
  \ it blossom. She also mentioned to me she is willing to travel to help support\
  \ Pathfinder Society in and around the region, including southern Wyoming and northern\
  \ New Mexico, east into Kansas and west into Utah.</p> \n     <p>I also want to\
  \ thank Doug Daulton for all he did for Pathfinder Society in Las Vegas. I met Doug\
  \ at Neon Con last year and he ran a good watch. Due to his hectic and very busy\
  \ work schedule, he has taken a step back. One of Doug's Venture-Lieutenants, Chris\
  \ Clay, has stepped up and taken on the mantle of Venture-Captain. He mentioned\
  \ several challenges and goals for the next 6 to 12 months and I look forward to\
  \ seeing how Las Vegas reignites its interest in Pathfinder Society under Chris's\
  \ watch.</p> \n     <p>In July, I had the pleasure to meet Diego Winterborg when\
  \ I traveled to PaizoCon UK and Viking Lodge Summer Games. Diego was one of the\
  \ 13 original Venture-Captains chosen on October 4, 2010 and I had the honor of\
  \ working side-by-side with him for a year as a fellow Venture-Captain, and the\
  \ last 8 months as Campaign Coordinator. Diego did a fantastic job introducing Denmark\
  \ to Pathfinder Society and growing it. Unfortunately, he had to step aside as Venture-Captain\
  \ at the beginning of August due to hectic a life schedule and he will be sorely\
  \ missed. Stepping up to fill his shoes is Erik Ingersen. He will center his initial\
  \ activities out of Ringsted, while he works with current Venture-Lieutenant Jacob\
  \ Trier in Jutland to start growing Pathfinder Society again. He mentioned he would\
  \ also be looking for Venture-Lieutenants in Copenhagen, Holbaek, and Roskilde.\
  \ If you have an interest in helping grow Pathfinder Society in Denmark, please\
  \ send Erik an email. I'm sure he would greatly appreciate it.</p> \n     <p>Eddy\
  \ and Stephanie Roberts started Pathfinder Society coordination in Salt Lake City,\
  \ Utah, but have since had to step down for a hectic work and life schedule. Taking\
  \ over the reins for Pathfinder Society coordination and growth is Phillip Willis.\
  \ He had some very exciting and interesting ideas to restart Pathfinder Society\
  \ in Utah and I look forward to watching as Pathfinder Society grows by leaps and\
  \ bounds. He advised me he considers his region the entire state of Utah and possibly\
  \ northeastern Nevada, so if you live in those regions, make sure to reach out to\
  \ Phillip with any questions, advice, or help you can offer.</p> \n     <p>My first\
  \ week on the job last year, Doug Miles informed me he was having to step down due\
  \ to a new family and hectic work schedule. Not only was Doug one of the original\
  \ 13 Venture-Captains selected, but he was Pathfinder Society's first five-star\
  \ GM. When he stepped down, it was a huge blow to the Detroit area. Daniel Luckett\
  \ and Eric Clingenpeel have done their best to help fill the void while I have searched\
  \ for someone to step into Doug's shows. After almost a year without a Venture-Captain,\
  \ Detroit is finally getting their second one! Mason Whitlark is excited to fuel\
  \ the fire once again in Detroit and hopes to expand his area from Fenton to Ann\
  \ Arbor, and down to Toledo, Ohio. With Mason in place, joined by Daniel and Eric,\
  \ the entirety of Michigan should pretty much be covered.</p> \n     <p>Chris Jarvis\
  \ did a phenomenal job in Seattle over the course of 9 months. He took over the\
  \ Seattle Venture-Captain position the same week I started at Paizo. Under his watch,\
  \ <a href=\"http://nwpfs.org/\" target=\"_blank\">a website was created to bring\
  \ the community together</a>. Multiple weekly game days were established in more\
  \ than eight cities across Washington. And he coordinated and oversaw the smooth\
  \ operation of Pathfinder Society at more than seven local conventions. He also\
  \ went above and beyond his duties and was a tremendous aid to me with the coordination\
  \ of PaizoCon in July. His shoes will be tough ones to fill. His Venture-Lieutenant,\
  \ Kyle Elliott, has stepped up to the challenge and has hit the ground running,\
  \ coordinating Pathfinder games and demos at Pax Prime. The Washington Pathfinder\
  \ Society player base is in very good hands with Kyle at the helm.</p> \n     <p>I\
  \ am also excited to add four new areas to our Venture-Captain regions. The first\
  \ is Memphis, Tennessee. Phillip Goettsch already has some plans on how to kick-start\
  \ coordinated Pathfinder Society play in the western Tennessee region. He also advised\
  \ during his interview process that not only was he going to facilitate the establishment\
  \ of coordinated Pathfinder Society play in the greater Memphis area, but he was\
  \ going to try to reach as far north as Dyersburg, TN, northern areas of Mississippi,\
  \ and eastern Arkansas to include Little Rock, until a Venture-Captain or Venture-Lieutenants\
  \ could be found to coordinate Pathfinder Society in those regions. Please contact\
  \ him if you are able to assist him in western Tennessee.</p> \n     <p>The second\
  \ new region is Jacksonville, Florida. James Apostolou comes highly recommended\
  \ by several local Venture-Captains and Lieutenants, as well as local players and\
  \ GMs. Jacksonville is an area ripe for tremendous growth, and with the fairly recent\
  \ addition of the <a href=\"http://floridapfs.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Pathfinder\
  \ Society of Florida website</a> and the three current forums for Jacksonville game\
  \ locations alone, it looks like James has plenty to work with to grow and expand\
  \ Pathfinder Society in northeast Florida.</p> \n     <p>I met Matt Clay at Gen\
  \ Con, as he was one of my GMs. He did an outstanding job at Gen Con as a Tier 1\
  \ GM and I look forward to seeing what he has in store for Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\
  \ Western PA has just been waiting for someone to step up and take charge and Matt\
  \ is the man for the job. Not only will Matt oversee Pathfinder Society in the Pittsburgh\
  \ area, but if there is interest he will also cover Washington, PA; Wheeling, WV;\
  \ and possibly Somerset, PA. I am very interested to see the growth of Pathfinder\
  \ Society play and look forward to working with Matt again.</p> \n     <p>Finally,\
  \ Michael Seales will be taken over all of Alabama, operating out of Birmingham.\
  \ He is currently coordinating and organizing Pathfinder Society on Wednesday and\
  \ Friday nights at three different Birmingham stores and looks to expand further.\
  \ He is also planning to attend and coordinate Pathfinder Society for Birmingham\
  \ Game Days in March, Alabama Phoenix Festival II in May, and Play On Con VI in\
  \ July of 2013. Additionally, he is looking at the possibility of attending Kami-Con,\
  \ MOBICON, and Con*stellation as well. It looks like Alabama could be the next hotbed\
  \ of activity for Pathfinder Society growth.</p> \n     <p>We are still in need\
  \ of additional Venture-Captains in some regions and <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/about/regionalCoordinators\"\
  >you can find the list here</a> and the <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/getInvolved\"\
  >first phase of the application process here</a>.</p> \n     <p>If interested in\
  \ applying, please contact me after reviewing the application process in the previous\
  \ link.</p> \n     <p>Welcome aboard to all my new captains!</p> \n     <p>Mike\
