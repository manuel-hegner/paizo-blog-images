  \ class=\"date\">Wednesday, May 17, 2017</p> \n    <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"\
  > \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Last week, I previewed some of the offerings\
  \ in store for <a href=\"/paizocon\">PaizoCon 2017</a> attendees. The lottery ran\
  \ and we are in the open event selection period until next Monday. If you have May\
  \ 26-29 free and want to travel to beautiful Seattle, you can still pick up a badge\
  \ in-person at the PaizoCon Convention store.</p> \n     <p>While most of our focus\
  \ is on PaizoCon, the Gen Con catalog of events went live on their website last\
  \ Sunday. Attendees may browse the offerings and compile wish lists in preparation\
  \ for ticket sales starting May 28. With so many games and events, I wanted to highlight\
  \ some of the key Paizo offerings.</p> \n     <h2>Starfinder Society</h2> \n   \
  \  <p><a href=\"/starfinder\">Starfinder</a> is the buzzword for Gen Con, and the\
  \ Sagamore Ballroom will buzz with sounds of the future all weekend. Events kick\
  \ off with the <em>Starfinder Quest: Into the Unknown</em>. While we are running\
  \ free quests throughout the convention, both in the Exhibition Hall and the Sagamore\
  \ Ballroom, participation entails waiting in line, playing one of the six offerings,\
  \ then returning to the line. During the first two slots of the convention, Thursday\
  \ 8:00 AM-1:00 PM and 2:00 PM-7:00 PM, we offer a ticket version of the Quests,\
  \ which eliminates the waiting in line and gives attendees the chance to finish\
  \ the entire quest series in one sitting. These quests utilize 1st level pregenerated\
  \ characters available onsite.</p> \n     <p>Thursday evening is the premier of\
  \ the <em>Starfinder Society Special #1-00: Claim to Salvation</em>. This event\
  \ uses 4th level versions of the Starfinder iconic characters, which James Sutter\
  \ and the Starfinder team is currently previewing Friday's on this blog. The in-world\
  \ Starfinder Society needs firepower to complete a mission and turn to the iconics\
  \ to provide assistance. After Thursday evening's launch, the Gen Con schedule includes\
  \ tables of this event most slots.</p> \n     <p>The schedule is set up so that\
  \ an attendee may play Starfinder all Thursday with pregenerated characters, pick\
  \ up a copy of the <em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em> from the Paizo booth in the\
  \ Exhibition Hall, then make their own character and return Friday ready to play\
  \ Starfinder Society Scenarios <em>#1-01: The Commencement, #1-02: Fugitive on the\
  \ Red Planet</em>, and <em>#1-03: Yesteryear's Truth</em>. Of these offerings, #1-01\
  \ is a replayable scenario and #1-02 and #1-03 are for 1st to 4th level characters.\
  \ Product pages are not yet available on paizo.com, but will be posted soon.</p>\
  \ \n     <h2>Pathfinder Society</h2> \n     <p>If Starfinder isn't your focus, there\
  \ are plenty of Pathfinder Society offerings. Starting with <em>Pathfinder Society\
  \ Scenario #8-07: From the Tome of Righteous Repose</em>, we offer every subsequent\
  \ Season 8 scenario, including one table most sessions of <em>Pathfinder Society\
  \ Scenario #8-25: Unleashing the Untouchable</em> a scenario for level 12-15 characters.\
  \ We also have a few older scenarios, such as <em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #01:\
  \ Silent Tide</em> and <em>#7-99: Through Maelstrom Rift</em></p> \n     <p>Friday\
  \ night is the debut of the Season 9 multi-table interactive special, <em>Pathfinder\
  \ Society Scenario #9-00: Assault on Absalom</em>. This event takes over the Sagamore,\
  \ with 160 tables of the Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild and 20 tables of the\
  \ Pathfinder Adventure Card Guild playing the same scenario simultaneously. The\
  \ Gen Con event system lists tickets for this event by sub-tier, so there are five\
  \ different roleplaying event entries for the same event. We will monitor ticket\
  \ sales and adjust the number of tables in each sub-tier as necessary, but at the\
  \ event players will be required to play a character in the sub-tier for which they\
  \ hold a ticket. As a note, 9th level is not listed for sale. This is the gap level\
  \ and players of 9th level characters may purchase tickets for tier 7-8 or tier\
  \ 10-11. We will have copies of the pregenerated iconic characters available for\
  \ player use. The pregenerated characters only go to level 7, so there are no iconic\
  \ pregenerated characters available for subtier 10-11. The Season 9 scenario offerings\
  \ start Saturday morning at 8:00 AM. As with prior years, the first three scenarios\
  \ of the season are on offer. We round out our special event offerings with the\
  \ new multi-table modular special, <em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-99: The Solstice\
  \ Scar</em>, scheduled for Saturday evening from 8:00 PM-1:00 AM.</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ Adventure Card Guild has a full stock of events spanning all seasons of organized\
  \ play, including Season of the Shackles, Season of the Righteous, and Season of\
  \ the Runelords, Season of Plundered Tombs. We are putting final touches on the\
  \ next season and hope to announce more information soon. As well as seasonal play\
  \ and participating in the aforementioned <em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #9-00:\
  \ Assault on Absalom</em>, Gen Con sees a return of the Open Tournament. Starting\
  \ Thursday with qualifying rounds, the tournament event spans the entire convention,\
  \ with finals on Sunday at noon. Gather your teammates and come reign victorious!</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Pathfinder Society Academy is back this year, bigger and better than\
  \ ever. Aimed at providing youth ages 6-17 a positive gaming experience, we set\
  \ aside space specifically for them and their families. Programming includes the\
  \ three modules of lessons: Beginner, Advanced, and Transitions, which introduce\
  \ the game from the ground up and prepare the players for running characters in\
  \ the Pathfinder Society, as well as Pathfinder Society Scenarios selected from\
  \ prior season's catalogs. Adults are welcome at Pathfinder Society Academy tables\
  \ as long as they accompany a youth. For their safety and enjoyment, children ages\
  \ 6-12 must have a parent who remains at the Pathfinder Society Academy area. Youth\
  \ ages 13-15 must have a parent in the Sagamore Ballroom and youth aged 16-17 need\
  \ a way to contact a parent onsite in case of emergency.</p> \n     <p>If playing\
  \ games doesn't pique your interest, consider attending one of the Paizo panels.\
  \ The first seminar starts Thursday at 11:00 AM and run through Sunday at noon.\
  \ Topics include returning favorites like Ask the Paizo GMs, Writing for Paizo,\
  \ Pathfinder Rules Q&amp;A, and Aunty Lisa's Story Hour. New offerings this year\
  \ include Making your First Starfinder Character, Starfinder Rules Design Workshop,\
  \ Secrets of the Pact Worlds, and Starfinder Adventure Path Q&amp;A. Come learn\
  \ all the secrets of your favorite games!</p> \n     <p>Whew! I knew we offered\
  \ quite a few activities at Gen Con, but it wasn't until I was trying to select\
  \ which to highlight in this blog that I realized how great programming is available.\
  \ I couldn't touch on everything, so I urge you to check out <a href=\"https://www.gencon.com/event_finder\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">the Gen Con catalog</a> and search keyword Paizo.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>Over the past couple of weeks, we had some changes in Sagamore Ballroom leadership.\
  \ Jon Cary, a stalwart presence for many years, stepped back from the role and Bob\
  \ Jonquet is spearheading efforts. We added Walter Sheppard to the team to make\
  \ up for Jon's departure. Rounding out the executive team is Lucas Servideo and\
  \ Todd Morgan. Thank you to Jon for his many years spent planning and executing\
  \ Pathfinder Society events at Gen Con. Enjoy seeing the show this year!</p> \n\
  \     <p>For those whose travel plans are undecided, we still need GM assistance,\
  \ including a handful of Tier 1 positions. The team and I spent the past weeks contacting\
  \ those that already signed up and are working on scheduling those individuals for\
  \ events. You should have schedule information before ticket sales go live on the\
  \ 28th. Watch your inbox for correspondence. If you are interested in GMing at the\
  \ event, complete the <a href=\"https://goo.gl/forms/nChfPO5oTNesZf422\" target=\"\
  _blank\">questionnaire</a> and we will be in contact shortly.</p> \n     <p>Also\
  \ for GMs, Origins Game Fair is also still looking for individuals to fill some\
  \ slots at the convention held June 14 to 19 in Columbus, Ohio. Interested volunteers\
  \ should sign up by sending Venture-Captain Michael McNerney an email at ohiopfs@gmail.com.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>I look forward to seeing many of you at PaizoCon in just over a week.\
  \ If you're attending, please stop by the Grand Ballroom and say hi! Just remember,\
  \ there are few strangers in gaming, but many friends you haven't met yet!</p> \n\
  \     <p>Until next timeâ€”Explore, Report, Cooperate!</p> \n     <p>Tonya Woldridge<br>\
