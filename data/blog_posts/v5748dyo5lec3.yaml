  \ Me About My Characters</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Thursday, January 10, 2013</p>\
  \ \n    <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n     <p>I've been told, all right.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><span itemprop=\"description\">A few weeks ago we <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5le84\"\
  >ran a contest</a>, in which people competed to stat up characters from my Pathfinder\
  \ Tales fiction. Choosing only three favorites from these entries was incredibly\
  \ hard. There wasn't a dog among them—no offense, Arni—and of course almost everyone\
  \ who built an entry (or five) did something unique.</span></p> \n     <p>With a\
  \ little help from \"Mean\" Russ Taylor, I narrowed the field to five favorites.\
  \ That made things even harder, because every one of them had something different\
  \ to recommend it. Some were elegant in their simplicity, others demonstrated exacting\
  \ (and rather flattering) attention to detail. Others just plain put me to shame,\
  \ because you folks know the rules so much better than I do.</p> \n     <p>What\
  \ won me over in the end was a combination of authenticity to the characters coupled\
  \ with innovative or surprising design choices. My three favorite entries gave me\
  \ a new way of looking at how those characters do what they do. </p>\n     <h2>My\
  \ Favorites (in no particular order)</h2> \n     <p><a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5le84?Dave-Gross-Stat-Up-My-Characters#37\"\
  ><b>Xellos (Jeggare)</b></a>—This one is both highly faithful to the novels and\
  \ a very innovative build, since the magus didn't exist when I first imagined the\
  \ count. Excellent explanations. Just outstanding all around.</p> \n     <p><a href=\"\
  /paizo/blog/v5748dyo5le84?Dave-Gross-Stat-Up-My-Characters#45\"><b>havoc xiii (Radovan)</b></a>—\
  While I originally thought of monk levels for Radovan, the cad works out really\
  \ well. This is another innovative build that challenged my preconceptions even\
  \ as it was faithful to what we see Radovan doing in the books.</p> \n     <p><a\
  \ href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5le84&amp;page=2?Dave-Gross-Stat-Up-My-Characters#51\"\
  ><b>Rosgakori (Kemeili)</b></a>—Really excellent, a trifle more powerful than I'd\
  \ imagined her, but in ways that fit. Spell selection a little different from what\
  \ I'd sketched out for the book, but since I didn't show her casting every spell\
  \ she knew, that's not a problem.</p> \n     <h2>Very Honorable Mentions (also in\
  \ no particular order)</h2> \n     <p><a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5le84?Dave-Gross-Stat-Up-My-Characters#49\"\
  ><b>Jesse Benner (Jeggare/Radovan)</b></a>—Extremely faithful to the books, these\
  \ straight-up builds are pretty close to what I'd jotted down in my notes. Although\
  \ I hadn't given Radovan any fighter levels, they certainly make sense.</p> \n \
  \    <p><a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5le84?Dave-Gross-Stat-Up-My-Characters#11\"\
  ><b>Yumeko (Goblin Who Swallowed the Wind)</b></a>—A beautifully simple presentation\
  \ of one of my favorite secondary characters. This one would have my \"less is more\"\
  \ prize if I had a bag full of special awards.</p> \n     <p><a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5le84?Dave-Gross-Stat-Up-My-Characters#21\"\
  ><b>Beek383 (Jeggare, Arnisant, Zandros, Mon Choi, Radovan)</b></a>—Together, these\
  \ were easily the most comprehensive survey of characters, nice and straightforward.\
  \ I like to think this is how others are using some of the novel characters in their\
  \ games.</p> \n     <p><a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5le84?Dave-Gross-Stat-Up-My-Characters#35\"\
  ><b>LoreKeeper (Radovan)</b></a>—A good basic build for Radovan, a little lower-level\
  \ than I'd imagined but with all of the essentials. I love the explanation. That\
  \ makes the entry—and those that followed its example—that much more interesting.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5le84?Dave-Gross-Stat-Up-My-Characters#36\"\
  ><b>Tangaroa (Azra)</b></a>—I actually like the \"ugly little girl\" take on Azra,\
  \ and this version definitely pays attention to her abilities from the book. Azra's\
  \ the character whose \"build\" I've most questioned since her first appearance,\
  \ since the oracle class came out soon after.</p> \n     <p><a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5le84?Dave-Gross-Stat-Up-My-Characters#38\"\
  ><b>Blue_Hill (Caladrel)</b></a>—A very good interpretation of the character, and\
  \ surprisingly close to what I statted up in Hero Lab. Well done!</p> \n     <p><a\
  \ href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5le84?Dave-Gross-Stat-Up-My-Characters#39\"><b>Kevin\
  \ Andrew Murphy (Iolanda)</b></a>—I never gave Iolanda's game stats this much thought,\
  \ but if I had, I hope I'd have come up with something this good. The skill and\
  \ spell selection make perfect sense. In this version, she's even deadlier than\
  \ I'd imagined.</p> \n     <p>Dave Gross<br> <i>Pathfinder Tales Author</i></p>\
