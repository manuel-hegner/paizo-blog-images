  >Pathfinder Battles</a> miniatures! This week I want to focus on many of the demons\
  \ in the set, particularly some of the \"rank and file\" types placed at the more\
  \ common rarities. WizKids did a wonderful job on the sculpts for these badboys,\
  \ and I am fairly confident that by the time we’re done with this set, less than\
  \ a tiny handful of official Pathfinder demons will be without representation in\
  \ prepainted plastic. Praise the dark lords of the Abyss!</span></p> \n     <div\

  \ very lowest form of demon in the Abyss. At CR 2, these guys are best when attacking\
  \ as a group, a tactic made easier by their common rarity. You can find the Sloth\
  \ Demon under a different name on page 60 of the <a href=\"/products/btpy8auu\"\
  >Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</a>. The Sloth Demon is a Small, common figure.</p> \n\

  \ Omox Demons), from page 79 of the <a href=\"/products/btpy8hif\">Pathfinder RPG\
  \ Bestiary 2</a>. While this demon is Medium-sized, he looms above most adventurers\
  \ in a most demon-like attack leap. The Slime Demon is a common figure.</p> \n \

  0\"> </a>\n     </div> \n     <p>This disgusting fellow is a Vermlek Demon, a hideous\
  \ example of a low-ranking demon in the armies of the Abyss. They wiggle and crawl\
  \ in nauseating numbers on Abyssal battlefields, hoping to inhabit a dead humanoid\
  \ foe as a parasitic puppetmaster. Born from the souls of those who violated the\
  \ dead in life—such as graverobbers, necromancers, and necrophiles—vermlek demons\
  \ appear as fat worms until they burrow their way into a host, after which they\
  \ look like this poor fellow here. Vermleks are found on page 54 of <a href=\"/products/btpy8hij\"\
  >Book of the Damned Vol. 2: Lords of Chaos</a>, and they play an important role\
  \ in the Wrath of the Righteous campaign. The Vermlek Demon is a Medium, common\
  \ figure.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71408_DemonicFamiliar.jpg\"\

  \ border=\"0\"> </a>\n     </div> \n     <p>This little guy loves perching on the\
  \ shoulders of chaotic evil wizards, flitting through the shadows of evil human\
  \ cities, and generally causing mischief wherever he goes. You can find his stats\
  \ (under a different name) on page 66 of the <a href=\"/products/btpy8auu\">Pathfinder\
  \ RPG Bestiary</a>. The Demonic Familiar is a Small (actually Tiny on a Small base),\
  \ uncommon figure.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71408_HornedDemon.jpg\"\

  0\"> </a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Up last today is the Horned Demon, a creature with\
  \ a long and interesting history in the Pathfinder RPG. This creature first appeared\
  \ in Paizo’s very first independent adventure product, the metal minis/adventure\
  \ hybrid \"Dark Elf Sanctum,\" the first GameMastery Compleat Encounter. It was\
  \ designed by Wayne Reynolds for an adventure written by freelancer Mike Mearls.\
  \ Years later, when we launched the Pathfinder world, we incorporated several characters\
  \ and monsters from this earlier product line, and the rest is history. The Horned\
  \ Demon (or Kalavakus Demon, in you prefer), is found on page 78 of the <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8hif\">Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2</a>. The mini is a Medium, uncommon\
  \ figure. </p> \n     <p>And that’s it for this week. Come on back in seven days\
  \ for another look ahead at the <a href=\"/products/btpy91pu\">Wrath of the Righteous</a>\
  \ miniatures set!</p> \n     <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p> \n    </div>\
