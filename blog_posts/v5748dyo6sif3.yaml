  \ Michael Sayre here again. <br> Thanks for an exciting playtest of the animist\
  \ and exemplar classes! We had a ton of responses that we’re busy sifting through\
  \ as we open these classes back up and start delving into what their futures might\
  \ hold. We’re busy keeping the Remaster ball rolling right now, so we’re going to\
  \ be pretty brief on the feedback here, but we can give you some insights into what\
  \ we’ll be looking to refine and what the future might hold.</p> \n      <div class=\"\

  \ \n      <br> \n      <h2>The Animist</h2> \n      <p>The animist feedback has\
  \ been very interesting. Most of you rated it as being moderately complicated, but\
  \ there was also overwhelming support for almost all the major class features (apparitions,\
  \ spellcasting, and vessel spells in particular). As such, we’re likely to keep\
  \ the main chassis with a few targeted areas of improvement. Here’s what we might\
  \ be changing and what might be staying the same.</p> \n      <ul> \n       <li><strong>Practices:\
  \ </strong>Folks have generally liked all the other individual pieces of the animist\
  \ but noted that it’s very complicated. Practices are one area where I think we\
  \ might be able to trim out some unnecessary complexity and tighten up the chassis.\
  \ There are a couple directions we might go here, but the one I’m currently eyeing\
  \ most closely is removing the practices entirely, standardizing the proficiency\
  \ progression of the class, and replacing practices with invocations—unique prayers\
  \ that speak to how each individual animist communes with their apparitions. This\
  \ could likely be a place where a refined version of Apparition’s Possession and\
  \ Apparition’s Whirl would live. It might also be the new home for Sustaining Dance;\
  \ this would move it to an even more class-specific resource that is part of the\
  \ main chassis instead of a feat. I’d likely be looking at introducing a few entirely\
  \ new invocations here as well to speak to other types of personalized rites and\
  \ prayers.</li> \n       <br> \n       <li><strong>Vessel Spells</strong>: Triple-casting\
  \ the same vessel spell is something a lot of you noted as leading to degenerative\
  \ play loops, and that was frankly something we’d always intended to put tighter\
  \ limitations on. For the final version, we’re looking at putting some stricter\
  \ limitations in place so that animists who focus on a single apparition are more\
  \ heavily encouraged to use their spell slots and animists who change rapidly between\
  \ different apparitions are more strongly encouraged to use a variety of vessel\
  \ spells.</li> \n       <br> \n       <li><strong>Spellcasting</strong>: The animist’\
  s spellcasting, which was a split between prepared spellcasting and spontaneous\
  \ casting of apparition spells, was extremely popular with a super-majority of players.\
  \ We’re likely to keep this as close to its current form as we can. I think there\
  \ are a few places we can probably smooth things out to make it easier for folks\
  \ to grok how the spellcasting actually works, but given the popularity of the progression\
  \ itself I suspect we’ll focus on refinements here rather than big changes.</li>\
  \ \n       <br> \n       <li><strong>Apparitions</strong>: We’re likely to significantly\
  \ expand the number of apparitions compared to those that appeared in the playtest.\
  \ We were very focused on testing out specific functions in this space to make sure\
  \ all the foundational pieces worked well; now we’ll be refining the ones from the\
  \ playtest and bringing in all kinds of new spirits for a variety of different themes\
  \ and environments. (There’s a Lurker in Crushing Dark apparition that’s been on\
  \ my idea board for a while now that I think is a shoo-in for folks who want either\
  \ a deep-sea predator vibe or a Dark Tapestry association, and a crafting-oriented\
  \ apparition I’m tinkering with that may or may not fit this space quite right…\
  \ We’ll have to see!)</li> \n      </ul> \n      <p>Those are the major areas of\
  \ potential change I see us working on for the animist as we go forward. We’re still\
  \ working our way through some of the more nuanced pieces of your feedback, though,\
  \ so nothing is set in stone quite yet! Now I’m going to kick it over to James Case\
  \ to talk about the exemplar.</p> \n      <br> \n      <h2>The Exemplar</h2> \n\
  \      <p>Hi everyone, James here. Let's talk about the exemplar! As always, the\
  \ goal of the playtest exemplar was to test a number of mechanics in service of\
  \ a strong final draft, rather than ensuring everything in the playtest was perfectly\
  \ balanced. Many of you found the core mechanic of moving your divine spark—the\
  \ focus of your power—into various sacred ikons to gain different effects to be\
  \ fun and a fresh take on a martial character, so let’s dig in a bit deeper.</p>\
  \ \n      <ul> \n       <li><strong>Rarity and Tone: </strong>The exemplar has a\
  \ pretty bombastic tone drawn from larger-than-life folklore and mythology. This\
  \ seemed to be a big selling point in favor of the class! A few people noted that\
  \ this tone means the exemplar might not fit into every campaign, though. This is\
  \ intentional! We’re aware that tonally and narratively, the exemplar might not\
  \ be for every single campaign, and therefore it’s pretty likely it will be staying\
  \ with its current rarity to signal to GMs and players alike that this class would\
  \ benefit from a brief check-in to see how it fits into the story—whether that's\
  \ as one PC in a party of other classes, or in an all-exemplar party. (Now I’m thinking\
  \ of the Golarion version of the Argonauts.)</li> \n       <br> \n       <li><strong>Power\
  \ Spikes: </strong>To go with this bombastic tone, the exemplar was intended to\
  \ have a pretty dynamic combat loop, with their defenses and offenses fluctuating\
  \ to make for high highs and low lows. While the idea of dynamically changing your\
  \ focus between offense and defense was very popular, we also think that we might\
  \ want to ensure this isn't <em>too</em> swingy, so we will be stabilizing a little\
  \ bit of the exemplar’s power. We're looking at increasing their defenses a tad\
  \ and giving them a wider range of abilities for each of their ikon types, ensuring\
  \ that you have less of a “downturn” between your Big Transcendent Weapon Moves\
  \ (which, let's be honest, was what you were trying to use anyway), as well as a\
  \ slightly wider range of useful supplementary abilities that you get all the time,\
  \ not just when an ikon has your spark in it.</li> \n       <br> \n       <li><strong>Domain\
  \ Spells: </strong>Domain spells are in an odd place—people thought they were useful,\
  \ but also that they were a little boring, which makes sense since these are shared\
  \ with other classes. The exemplar already has a lot to track with its spark placement\
  \ and is primarily a martial character, so we’d rather lean into this as their main\
  \ gameplay hook and will be removing domain spells from the exemplar in the final\
  \ version of the class. However, the theme of “gaining a domain for yourself” was\
  \ a popular one, so like our approach with the thaumaturge and its pact feats in\
  \ <em>Dark Archive</em>, we will be moving this theme to an archetype later in the\
  \ book that thematically aligns with the exemplar’s whole “reach into the heavens\
  \ and seize godhood” thing in a very natural way.</li> \n       <br> \n       <li><strong>Epithet\
  \ Recasting:</strong> A lot of you seemed to like using epithets to shape your character's\
  \ story, and in fact, many people wanted these to be an even bigger part of the\
  \ class. With the removal of spells, we have a little room to play here with the\
  \ epithets—I have a couple of ways I'm thinking about going with it, and I don't\
  \ know quite which one it's going to be yet, but I think it's a fun idea!</li> \n\
  \       <br> \n       <li><strong>MORE MORE MORE:</strong> Yes, there will be more.\
  \ We know that there was not the widest selection of ikon types for the playtest,\
  \ because we were looking at testing out the basic primary colors—major categories\
  \ of weapon, for example—but with everyone’s feedback from the playtest, we can\
  \ look at some more shades, like ikon types that are a bit more niche. Yes, there\
  \ will be unarmed attack exemplars in final (however would I do my Bull of Heaven\
  \ exemplar without it?), and yes, there will be a greater variety of ikon and epithet\
  \ choices (however would I do my Demeter “the turbulent pinwheel of the seasons’\
  \ change” exemplar without it?) as well.</li> \n      </ul> \n      <br> \n    \
  \  <p>Thank you for coming along for the ride and for all your feedback! There was\
  \ a lot to test with the exemplar, but with everyone's responses, we're in a good\
  \ place to move forward with polishing the class up. I'll pass things back to Mike\
  \ for some final notes!</p> \n      <p>And Mike takes the mic for the final thoughts!</p>\
  \ \n      <p>The TLDR on this one is that it was a great playtest with a lot of\
  \ positive responses and a lot of useful feedback to get these things refined. These\
  \ were some of the highest-scoring classes we’ve put out as far as overall satisfaction\
  \ ratings go, and we’re really pleased that so many of you were excited about these\
  \ ideas and so eager to share your thoughts and experiences. Take care all, and\
  \ we’ll see you next October when these classes take up arms to defend Golarion\
  \ during the <em>War of Immortals</em>!</p> \n      <p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\
