    \ thick tree branches. In the foreground, Harsk, a gruff gnome ranger with long\
    \ hair and an almost equally long beard, is peering out from behind large, leafy\
    \ plants. Behind him, Lini - an excited-looking gnome druid, uses her right hand\
    \ to brush back overgrown greenery from a stone column twice her height and half\
    \ as wide. She holds a torch in her left hand, which lights the image in dark\
    \ red. She has partially revealed square-shaped carvings in the side of the column.\
    \ Behind her - to the right - her snow leopard companion Droogami, looks to see\
    \ what she's discovered."
