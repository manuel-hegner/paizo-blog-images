  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Wednesday, September 16, 2015</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"\
  articleBody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">I know your sob story. It's written\
  \ on your face, same as everyone else's. The world just rolled over and dumped you\
  \ on your butt. Know you don't know how to get a roof and three squares without\
  \ a coin in your pocket, and don't know how to put coin in your pocket without a\
  \ good night's sleep and a full belly.</p> \n    <p>Luckily, we know all these things.\
  \ Lots more of us than you, after all—all of us hungry and scraping but still getting\
  \ by. We know what you can eat. Hell, we know who you can eat. The city streets\
  \ aren't just a bunch of people; they're nature—screwed up, turned-around, greedy,\
  \ grasping, vicious nature. You can be one of the lucky ones, riding on top of it\
  \ all like princes in a yacht, thinking you're master of it all but never seeing\
  \ a hint of what goes on for real. Or you can be like the rest of us: Down below,\
  \ stinking of it and getting by like any other animal. You can be a deer or a squirrel,\
  \ maybe, but I advise being a wolf, friend. Wolves don't come to such sudden and\
  \ unpleasant ends. Ain't food for no one, except maybe those useless sorts who think\
  \ they're on top, and you don't see their sort down here in the gutters so often.</p>\

  \ \n    <p>We got a book right here: Make yourselves <a href=\"/products/btpy9ghc\"\
  ><em>Heroes of the Streets</em></a>. Blend in, bite back, and don't be anyone's\
  \ meal ticket. Find a warm place to sleep and do it all again tomorrow. You can\
  \ be scum like the rest of us—learn to be an Alley Witch, or a Street oracle, or\
  \ a Slum Shaman—or sell your soul and work for the town guard as a Constable Cavalier\
  \ or Lamplighter Investigator. The book don't care. You think you're too wild for\
  \ the city? The book don't believe you. The book's seen Hunters and Bloodragers\
  \ twist themselves—urbanize themselves—to fit this place before it ever saw the\
  \ city twist itself to fit them. The book's got spells to make the best of the stunty\
  \ little plants here and there, or to walk you big, mean monster pet right under\
  \ a guard's nose. The book's got feats to help you get by in all the dark, forgotten\
  \ bits every city seems to have. The book tells you where you people fit, so you\
  \ can fit in with 'em, or spit in their eye for wiping you off their boots.</p>\

  \ transmutation; <b>Level</b> alchemist 1, antipaladin 1, bard 1, bloodrager 1,\
  \ magus 1, sorcerer/wizard 1<br> <b>Casting Time</b> 1 standard action<br> <b>Components</b>\

  \ yes (harmless, object)</p> \n     <p>You turn up to three coins into deadly projectiles\
  \ that gain the velocity of a bullet when thrown. The coins retain their normal\
  \ appearance but can be used as simple thrown weapons with a range increment of\
  \ 20 feet and a critical multiplier of ×2. The transmuted coins are treated as ammunition\
  \ for the purposes of drawing them. Like firearm bullets, the coins deal bludgeoning\
  \ and piercing damage, and attacks with them are resolved as touch attacks within\
  \ the first range increment. Regardless of whether a transmuted coin hits or misses\
  \ the target, it is destroyed after the attack. Only you can make attacks with the\
  \ coins, though other creatures can safely handle them without discharging the spell.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>You can make a single ranged attack with a coin as part of casting this\
  \ spell. Different types of coins create different bullet effects. Copper coins\
  \ deal 1d4 points of damage. Silver coins deal 1d6 points of damage and count as\
  \ silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Gold coins deal 1d8 points\
  \ of damage and count as masterwork weapons. Platinum coins deal 1d10 points of\
  \ damage, count as masterwork weapons, and are treated as adamantine weapons for\
  \ the purposes of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness. All coin bullets\
  \ deal an additional 1 point of damage per 2 caster levels (to a maximum of an extra\
  \ 10 points of damage at 20th level).</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>You think\
  \ you've seen the worst the city has to offer? The book will teach you how to be\
  \ the worst the city has to offer. It's short—just 32 pages—and easy to read. Just\
  \ a few happy coins and the <a href=\"/products/btpy9ghc\">book</a> is yours...</p>\
