  articlebody\"> \n     <p>The team's been appreciating the slightly less hectic pace\
  \ that's followed Gen Con and the end of what we consider convention season. That's\
  \ no reason to slack off, though, and we've been busy with the contributions of\
  \ some talented authors to bring you Season 9's next two scenarios. What's more,\
  \ Chris Lambertz recently updated <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety\">the Pathfinder\
  \ Society page</a>!</p> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">The Year of Factions'\
  \ Favor has several intended themes—most notably a chance to feature factions' storylines\
  \ in exciting ways—but Linda and I have found that this season lends itself to two\
  \ themes that are equally gratifying: bringing back past NPCs and having them team\
  \ up with the PCs directly to do awesome things. If you've followed earlier Pathfinder\
  \ Society stories, you'll no doubt recognize several of these characters, as well\
  \ as many more in the months to come. Even if you're newer to the campaign, we introduce\
  \ these curators, adventurers, schemers, and scallywags in a way that should bring\
  \ you up to speed in no time—and if you want recommendations on earlier scenarios\
  \ to play leading up to these, the community's always happy to identify earlier\
  \ pieces of the larger story.</p> \n     <p>Of course, studying past events and\
  \ the bigger picture is just the sort of things that historians, archaeologists,\
  \ and Pathfinders do. My background is in archaeology, and I always like the occasional\
  \ reminder that fieldwork isn't all cracking bullwhips and casting magic missile;\
  \ a lot of public-sector archaeology (at least in the USA) is referred to as cultural\
  \ resource management (CRM), which involves identifying, salvaging, and preserving\
  \ archaeological sites—particularly those that might be impacted by imminent industrial\
  \ or construction projects.</p> \n     <p>I like to think that the same sort of\
  \ thing happens on Golarion, including in Thuvia, where <a href=\"/products/btpy9weo?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-9-04-The-Unseen-Inclusion\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #9-04: The Unseen Inclusion</em></a> takes place.\
  \ As the city of Merab expands to accommodate new growth, construction teams periodically\
  \ uncover undocumented ruins dating back to the Tekritanin League. Local archaeologists\
  \ have some time to study and record their findings before building continues, though\
  \ even this process can come to a screeching halt when that process uncovers supernatural\
  \ dangers.</p> \n     <p>In this Tier 1-5 scenario, Mike Kimmel explores what happens\
  \ when Obahar, one of the city's archaeologists, unleashes a screaming fiend that\
  \ has escaped to terrorize the town. The Pathfinder Society's local venture-captain,\
  \ Diya Akan, maintains a deal to assist with difficult ruins, and the PCs' first\
  \ obligation is to help with the archaeological analysis of the treacherous site\
  \ buried below. However, their discoveries have grave ramifications for one of the\
  \ Society's closest allies, and the PCs must hurry if they're to avert additional\
  \ disasters. This scenario plays an important role in setting up the upcoming <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy9wer?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-9-07-Salvation-of-the-Sages\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #9-07: Salvation of the Sages</em></a>. Whether\
  \ your Scarab Sages faction PCs are low level or higher, you won't want to miss\
  \ these!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PZOPSS0904E-DiyaAkan.jpg\"\

  \ <p>The Blakros Museum has a well-deserved reputation for small-scale disasters\
  \ related to its most recent exhibit of artifacts, statues, and other relics. Before\
  \ the black basalt building housed the Blakros family's collections, it served as\
  \ the observatory of the mighty Ralzeros the Overwatched, who used the structure\
  \ to gaze into the cosmos and beyond. Alarms sound when an object on loan from the\
  \ museum triggers a magical catastrophe in the Pathfinder Society's Grand Lodge,\
  \ and it's up to the PCs to investigate, put a stop to the madness, and trace the\
  \ mysterious relic to its source. Christopher Wasko has provided us a delightful\
  \ Tier 3-7 adventure in <a href=\"/products/btpy9wep?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-9-05-Call-of-the-Copper-Gate\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #9-05: Call of the Copper Gate</em></a>. We're\
  \ not only thrilled because this begins an engaging Dark Archive faction story that\
  \ explores one of the most beloved (and infamous) sites in the Pathfinder Society\
  \ campaign; we're also thrilled that the PCs in this adventure get to work directly\
  \ alongside several familiar faces. Speaking of which, it's our pleasure to introduce\
  \ you to Imrizade Blakros, who first appeared in <a href=\"/products/btpy8arc?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-35-Voice-in-the-Void\"\
