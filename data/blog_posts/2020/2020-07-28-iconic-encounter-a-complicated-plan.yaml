  \ front of her.</p>\n              <p>“<em>Now</em> can we get started with my plan?”\
  \ he asked.</p>\n              <p>The two adventurers were holed up in a tiny inn\
  \ in Almas, and thanks to Lem, every inch of their room was covered in paper. Books\
  \ sat in high piles on the room’s only table, alongside spent ink bottles, quills,\
  \ and, of course, sheets and sheets of parchment. But it wasn’t the pages of transcriptions\
  \ and doodles on the table that concerned Lem now, so much as the ones displayed\
  \ upon the wall.</p>\n              <p><em>His plan.</em></p>\n              <p>It\
  \ was essentially a collage—sheets and scrolls to match the scraps around the room—\
  pinned precariously between the chamber’s two sputtering torches. Every inch of\
  \ paper had notes, names, commentary, and observations scrawled across them, and\
  \ most of these were pinned beside illustrations that Merisiel had to assume were\
  \ related. A few maps and blueprints, charcoal rubbings, and pictures torn from\
  \ books—but most of the images were clearly quick sketches of people, in Lem’s familiar\
  \ style. The only structure to these focal points came from a handful of strands\
  \ of crisscrossing, multicolored yarn, pinned down from picture to page and beyond,\
  \ intersecting here and there like a haphazard spiderweb. It looked like the kind\
  \ of thing a mad servant of Rovagug might call art—but to her, it just seemed like\
  \ a cry for help.</p>\n              <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n             \

  \      <p>“So,” he asked, lifting his bushy eyebrows. “What do you think?”</p>\n\
  \              <p>Merisiel took a deep breath, before finally asking the question\
  \ she’d had since first boarding a ship for Andoran.</p>\n              <p>“What\
  \ is all this about, Lem?”</p>\n              <p>To his credit, the halfling only\
  \ faltered for a moment, a flash of disappointment as he scratched at the side of\
  \ his head and his eyes flitted back and forth between his “plan” and the elf he’\
  d roped into helping him with it. He lowered his hands, nodded, mumbled something\
  \ under his breath so low even Merisiel’s keen ears couldn’t hear it clearly, and\
  \ then met her concerned gaze with a solemn one of his own.</p>\n              <p>“\
  As I said…I believe that there is a ring of Chelish spies at work here in Almas,\
  \ a secret conspiracy of infernal agents subtly working to influence Andoren politics…\
  and we are the only people who can stop them.”</p>\n              <p>“No, I mean—\
  what does all <em>this</em> have to do with ambushing a Chelish spy?” the elf asked,\
  \ shaking out a few loose strands of her long silver hair.</p>\n              <p>She\
  \ glanced up at the wall again. She supposed now she could understand a little bit\
  \ more of it; most of the map-scraps involved the border between Andoran and Cheliax,\
  \ and there were a few infernal symbols and sketches of Hellknights. At least Lem’\
  s paranoia made sense—he’d been raised a slave in Cheliax, after all.</p>\n    \
  \          <p>“It all started,” Lem said, and there was a flash of performance in\
  \ his tone, the spark of heraldry that usually only came out in the midst of battle.\
  \ “When an old friend from the Bellflower Network reached out…”</p>\n          \
  \    <p>The halfling indicated one of the doodles pinned to the wall. He began to\
  \ speak at length about his old friend, a former slave, who had noticed certain\
  \ Andoren merchants seemed to be making double their usual shipments…and all of\
  \ them suspiciously close to the Chelish border.</p>\n              <p>“Her intel\
  \ of course connects to Step Six of my plan,“ he poked at a different section of\
  \ the wall. “Wherein, hopefully, any decoy Chelish caravans have already been waylaid\
  \ by members of a certain halfling ‘legitimate business organization.’”</p>\n  \
  \            <p>Merisiel was still seated, but she was trying to appear fully invested,\
  \ even as her fingers fiddled with the dagger hilts protruding over her shoulder\
  \ from the brace on her back.</p>\n              <p>“Legitimate…” she murmured,\
  \ then brightened. “There’s a halfling mafia?”</p>\n              <p>“No,” Lem said,\
  \ frowning. “But just in case, don’t ever mention them again.”</p>\n           \
  \   <p>Without missing a beat, he charged back into his plan, jumping from point\
  \ to point across the papers with no truly discernible pattern. One moment he’d\
  \ be explaining how he’d mapped out town guards’ patrol routes, then he’d leap to\
  \ a note about the weather along the border.</p>\n              <p>Although Merisiel\
  \ had only just arrived in Almas, Lem had been lurking in the city for over a month.\
  \ He’d eavesdropped on merchants and mercenaries, paid off Chelish expatriates,\
  \ and pumped sympathetic Andoren warriors for intel—usually in disguise. The little\
  \ bard had been busy with every manner of espionage at his disposal, and all of\
  \ it had been for the sake of building an excruciatingly elaborate plan that, at\
  \ least as far as Merisiel could tell, really only amounted to “ambush.”</p>\n \
  \             <p>The rogue felt her attention straying. Trying to keep her mind\
  \ occupied, she flipped a knife around deftly, using its deadly point to clean beneath\
  \ her fingernails. She grimaced at some of the filth she found there, and hastily\
  \ wiped the dirtied blade off on the closest scrap of parchment.</p>\n         \
  \     <p>Lem hadn’t noticed, still jabbering excitedly:</p>\n              <p>“…\
  and thanks to the help of that poor hellspawn trader—no friend of the Chelish, unsurprisingly—\
  we know exactly which coach our suspected spy will be driving.”</p>\n          \
  \    <p>Merisiel looked up at him. “So then we catch it, and stab them?”</p>\n \
  \             <p>“No, no, no,” Lem said with a sigh. “We will already be lying in\
  \ wait, assuming we leave tonight. Remember Step Thirty-four?”</p>\n           \
  \   <p>Merisiel failed to subdue a groan.</p>\n              <p>“What?” asked Lem,\
  \ blinking, genuinely perplexed.</p>\n              <p>“It’s just…” Merisiel trailed\
  \ off awkwardly. She began digging her knife through some folded-up parchment, gently\
  \ scoring the wood beneath.</p>\n              <p>“Where did I lose you? Step Fourteen,\
  \ with the carriage switch? Or Step Twenty-nine, where Valeros and Kyra help us\
  \ rig traps at the abandoned border checkpoint?”</p>\n              <p>Lem was pointing\
  \ down at the table with a frown, where his friend’s knife was digging nervously\
  \ into the parchment. Merisiel’s cheeks actually reddened a little as she saw that\
  \ she had indeed scratched a line over a few scrabbled words, including “western\
  \ border” and “abandoned checkpoint.” She cleared her throat and casually spun the\
  \ knife before plunging its blade fully into the wood of the table, as if to say,\
  \ “I meant to do that.”</p>\n              <p>“It’s not the, uh, overall plan, Lem,”\
  \ she started, sighing. “Clearly you’ve been busy as a bugbear at a baby shower,\
  \ but it all seems a bit…convoluted?”</p>\n              <p>The halfling gaped at\
  \ her</p>\n              <p>“It just seems like it doesn’t require thirty-four—“\
  </p>\n              <p>“Thirty-<em>seven</em>,” Lem interjected.</p>\n         \
  \     <p>“—Thirty-seven steps! And we’ll follow you on all of ‘em. But doesn’t it\
  \ all add up to: hide, wait, and then jump ‘em?”</p>\n              <p>Merisiel\
  \ gestured toward the madcap collage of yarn, paper, and pictures, the books and\
  \ debris strewn about the room, and finally, at Lem. The halfling was working himself\
  \ into a lather over concocting the perfect scheme, when—at least as far as she\
  \ was concerned—all they really needed was a head start and a little luck.</p>\n\
  \              <p>She rose from her seat, shaking her head softly, trying to meet\
  \ his eyes under his mop of blond hair.</p>\n              <p>“You’ve planned enough,”\
  \ Merisiel said, her tone steady and confident. “We’re ready.”</p>\n           \
  \   <p>“Meri, this is Cheliax—it’s serious. If I’ve missed even one detail, misunderstood\
  \ or forgotten one scrap of information—“</p>\n              <p>“You haven’t!” the\
  \ rogue declared with an assuring smile, clapping her hand to his shoulder. “I mean,\
  \ look at all this! You’ve thought this through from every angle.”</p>\n       \
  \       <p>She deftly snatched blades from her dagger brace, and, one by one, with\
  \ impossible swiftness, she tossed them at the wall—each one landing home on an\
  \ illustration.</p>\n              <p>“We leave now—“</p>\n              <p><em>THUNK.</em></p>\n\
  \              <p>“We stay ahead of the spy—“</p>\n              <p><em>THUNK.</em></p>\n\
  \              <p>“We meet Kyra and Valeros—“</p>\n              <p><em>THUNK.</em></p>\n\
  \              <p>“And we stage our ambush before they cross the border.”</p>\n\
  \              <p><em>THUNK. THUNK. THUNK.</em></p>\n              <p>Lem looked\
  \ at the circle of daggers embedded in the wall, watching as Merisiel strode over\
  \ to the plan, withdrawing her knives one at a time. By the time she’d finished\
  \ and turned back, he was grinning along with her. For the first time since the\
  \ planning began, the halfling seemed like his old, confident self.</p>\n      \
  \        <p>“I think you’re right,” he said with a cocky little grin. “I <em>have</em>\
  \ thought of everything.”</p>\n              <p>Lem reached onto the table and plucked\
  \ Merisiel’s last dagger from its resting place, tossing it back to her. She caught\
  \ it deftly, and the two of them set about gathering their gear, ready to set off\
  \ without looking back.</p>\n              <p>Unnoticed on the table, the scrap\
  \ of paper Merisiel had been stabbing, no longer pinned, unfurled from the many\
  \ folds and creases it had earned. Around the scratches, stains, and bits of under-fingernail\
  \ dirt, text was clearly visible, a note hastily passed on to Lem by a terrified\
  \ hellspawn trader—</p>\n              <p>“Along the western border, you’ll pass\
  \ a single abandoned checkpoint…”</p>\n              <p>And beneath it, previously\
  \ obscured by the parchment’s folds, the words continued—</p>\n              <p><em>“\
  Avoid it at all costs.”</em></p>\n             </blockquote>\n             <p style=\"\
