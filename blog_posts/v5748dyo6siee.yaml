  \ my first action, I blow the shofar to inspire courage. Hello! My name is James\
  \ Beck. I am a Jewish author who wrote for Lost Omens Firebrands (specifically the\
  \ Fire’s Finest &amp; Passenger). I felt at home to tell Jewish stories in Numeria\
  \ as I related to the story of the androids and the struggles they went through\
  \ with the Technic League. In my works either with Paizo or Eldritch Osiris Games,\
  \ I try to bring in themes and values of Jewish culture that I grew up with such\
  \ as tikun olam (repair the world). Pathfinder/Starfinder have greatly emphasized\
  \ the idea of adventurers trying to make the world or universe a better place to\
  \ live in. Jewish culture teaches us to be curious and to explore and I feel honored\
  \ to be part of this community where I can explore different ideas and learn about\
  \ all that has come before. Thank you Pathfinder and Starfinder community for giving\
  \ me a chance to learn and grow not only as a writer but as a person as well. You\
  \ can find me @geekjames513 on twitter!</p> \n      <br> \n      <h3>Michael Bramnik\
  \ (he/him)</h3> \n      <p>Why is this knight different from all other knights?\
  \ I know, I know—wrong holy day!</p> \n      <p>Hello there, and L’Shana Tova! I’\
  m Michael Bramnik (<a href=\"https://canisdirus.carrd.co/\">https://canisdirus.carrd.co</a>),\
  \ a Jewish freelancer for Paizo and elsewhere in the industry. I’ve had the privilege\
  \ of writing for <em>Starfinder Enhanced</em> and several other things this past\
  \ year, but the one that stands out for me today is <em>Pathfinder Society #4-05:\
  \ The Arclord Who Never Was</em>. Though far from being a universal opinion, I have\
  \ heard firsthand that RPGs aren’t as popular in our communities because of things\
  \ taken from Jewish myth or folklore and then “twisted.” The character Vrisk was\
  \ my way of putting a positive spin on golems in RPGs to combat this—something I’\
  m very proud of.</p> \n      <p>Beyond that, I’d like to offer something fun to\
  \ help celebrate the new year. This probably won’t ever become PFS-legal, mind you,\
  \ but maybe it could be a fun addition to your home game?<br><br></p> \n      <p>Ram's\

  \ B; Bulk L<br> Hands 1; Range 10 ft.; Reload 0<br> Type Ranged; Category Simple;\

  \ unique ways. They can play musical notes as well as rupture eardrums in combat\
  \ through staccato blasts.</p> \n      <br> \n      <h3>Rue Dickey (they/he/xe)</h3>\
  \ \n      <p>Wishing a happy new year to all of my fellow Jewish nerds—may your\
  \ apples be crisp and the honey linger on your lips. As a practicing Jewish witch,\
  \ I have a deep love for the spirituality of our religion and culture, and how the\
  \ world’s cycles interact. Jewish ritual magic—for protection, for wellness, for\
  \ family and love—inspires a lot of my design work when it comes to magic in fantasy\
  \ games. It is equally important to get the sigils and designs right as it is to\
  \ have the right thoughts held in your heart and mind while completing them. Rituals\
  \ in Judaism are rooted in tradition, but like all aspects of our faith, are deeply\
  \ personal, and every family—or even every person—might practice them slightly differently.\
  \ No one ritual is correct, there is never only one answer—and there is always room\
  \ for change. I love getting to incorporate this philosophy in my work, and remind\
  \ everyone that questioning the world and “the way things are” is a vital part of\
  \ living. </p> \n      <br> \n      <h3>Avi Kool (they/them)</h3> \n      <p>Hi\
  \ all, Avi again, still here at Paizo, still Jewish. I’ve had the privilege of bringing\
  \ a Jewish perspective to my work from my heritage as both an Ashkenazi and Sephardic\
  \ Jew, and from my upbringing in Reform Judaism. This includes the opportunity to\
  \ write characters inspired by my family history (see Arhan Benimaya in the Kraken’\
  s Ink Tattoo section of Pathfinder Lost Omens Grand Bazaar), and I hope we can bring\
  \ more aspects of Jewish folklore and history into Pathfinder as time goes on. I’\
  m particularly interested in telling accurate folklore around Jewish monsters, because\
  \ Judaism is full of monsters! Whether that be the terrifying “biblically accurate\
  \ angels” (a misnomer, because these descriptions aren’t from the Bible originally,\
  \ they’re from the Torah) or golems or the Leviathan, Jewish lore is bursting with\
  \ material suited for TTRPGs. I’ve even recently been learning about the history\
  \ of dragons in Judaism—believe it or not, many medieval Jewish manuscripts feature\
  \ illustrations of dragons in the marginalia! They didn’t teach me about that in\
  \ Hebrew school. There’s also the shedim, Judaism’s precursor to the Christian demons.\
  \ Shedim are shapeshifters that can turn invisible, and it’s said that you could\
  \ throw ashes to the ground to render their footsteps visible. I have also read\
  \ that the tradition of using salt to ward off spirits originates in Judaism. As\
  \ you can see, Jewish lore contains bountiful material to be adopted respectfully\
  \ in TTRPGs, far beyond what we’ve seen published by any company. I might just write\
  \ it myself!</p> \n      <br> \n      <h3>Jacob W. Michaels (he/him)</h3> \n   \
  \   <p>Shana tova (happy New Year), Paizo community. I’m Jacob W. Michaels, one\
  \ of Paizo's Jewish freelancers. I’ve gotten to work on a number of products for\
  \ Paizo; this year, that includes the potions section in&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder Treasure\
  \ Vault</em>, the Findeladlara article in&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #189:\
  \ Dreamers of the Nameless Spires</em>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder Society Scenario\
  \ #4-11: Prisoners of the Electric Castle</em>! Part of what I love about Judaism\
  \ is our tradition of telling stories, and particularly stories that provide meaning.\
  \ I like to think I bring that tradition to role-playing games. We tell stories\
  \ together—and part of that is just for fun (though fun is 100% reason enough for\
  \ some of the stories we tell together), but part of it reaches deeper. We build\
  \ a sense of community through our stories, hopefully finding things we have in\
  \ common, even when we live across the world from each other. Through these games,\
  \ we find friendship. And I can’t think of a better way to celebrate Judaism in\
  \ my work. May this coming year bring more sweetness, more joy, more games, and\
  \ more time well spent together.</p> \n      <br> \n      <center>\n       <hr width=\"\
