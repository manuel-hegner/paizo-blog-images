  artist: "showing off some of the great weapons featured in Dragon's Trove, including\
    \ the bastardsword, falchion, morningstar, and pistol cards. We made sure to include\
    \ a wide variety of cards in this set that have not appeared before in any of\
    \ our other Item Card products, and these four are just a small sample. Next week,\
    \ we'll take a look at some of the more \"scaly\" cards in the set. Week 1 Riddle:\
    \ Who is the \"all-mighty Dragon King of the Truescale Kobolds\"? Here's a hint:\
    \ The answer can be found in one of our blog posts. All answers for the Week 1\
    \ Riddle are due by 12:01 PM Pacific Standard Time on Thursday, June 7th. Good\
    \ Luck! Jason Bulmahn GameMastery Brand Manager"
