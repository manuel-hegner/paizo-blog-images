  \     </div>\n     <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\">The swashbuckler\
  \ is swinging into <em>Pathfinder Player Core 2</em> with a fresh coat of paint\
  \ to show off their style and swagger like never before!</p>\n      <p>Swashbucklers\
  \ fight fast on their feet with flair. They dart between foes, gaining and expending\
  \ panache to execute powerful and flamboyant finishers. When a swashbuckler hits\
  \ their stride and lands their rolls, they create wonderful, memorable moments on\
  \ the battlefield. However, this could be difficult to do consistently based on\
  \ the encounter. In some low-threat encounters, swashbucklers easily dance around\
  \ the battlefield, able to gain and use panache freely, but in severe and extreme\
  \ fights, they often struggled to gain panache and use their class abilities. Additionally,\
  \ many swashbucklers heavily relied on Tumble Through as their primary way to obtain\
  \ panache, which led to less satisfying uses of Tumble Through instead of an exciting\
  \ way to move dynamically around the battlefield.</p>\n      <p>Our primary aim\
  \ with the swashbuckler’s remaster was therefore to increase the consistency of\
  \ the class to allow for more stylish moments.</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ Lastra</p>\n      </div>\n      <br>\n      <p>One way we’ve done this is through\
  \ the new bravado trait, which you’ll see in several places in the class. Bravado\
  \ is not only a bit more reliable for getting into panache, but the trait also lets\
  \ us give more actions the ability to grant panache, allowing for more diverse options\
  \ in combat. For instance, many of your swashbuckler styles might state that certain\
  \ actions gain the bravado trait.</p>\n      <p><strong>Bravado:</strong> Actions\
  \ with this trait can grant panache, depending on the result of the check involved.\
  \ If you succeed at the check on a bravado action, you gain panache, and if you\
  \ fail (but not critically fail) the check, you gain panache but only until the\
  \ end of your next turn. These effects can be applied even if the action had no\
  \ other effect due to a failure or a creature's immunity.</p>\n      <p>Not all\
  \ swashbucklers fight with honor, though. We’re introducing the new <strong>rascal</strong>\
  \ swashbuckler style in the remaster! Rascals aren’t afraid to use underhanded tactics\
  \ on the battlefield to show off their skills and thoroughly embarrass their foes\
  \ with a Dirty Trick or two. They do what they need to do to gain the advantage\
  \ and are happy to let their opponents drop their guard before striking fast, leaving\
  \ their foes in their dust before finishing them off, perhaps with a Twirling Throw.</p>\n\
  \      <h3><strong>Twirling Throw [one-action] — Feat 4</strong></h3>\n      <p><strong>Finisher,\
  \ Swashbuckler<br></strong><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Flying Blade<br>\n   \
  \     Your thrown weapons seem to defy physics as they soar through the air and\
  \ spin back to you after a strike. Make a thrown weapon attack, ignoring the penalty\
  \ for making ranged attacks within the second and third range increment. The weapon\
  \ returns to your hand after the attack unless you critically failed on the attack\
  \ roll.</p>\n      <p><em><a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02ej5\">Pathfinder\
  \ Player Core 2</a></em> is full of exciting remastered ancestries, classes, spells,\
  \ and more to allow you to truly make the most of your games. Look forward to more\
  \ previews of other remastered classes in the near future!</p>\n      <p style=\"\
