  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">I want to\
  \ apologize for the lack of blogs the past two weeks. I returned from Gamehole Con\
  \ in Madison and critically failed my fort save, succumbing to con crud of epic\
  \ proportions. My week enforced vacation provided much needed rest but resulted\
  \ in some tasks not getting done. On a positive note, that means two days of organized\
  \ play blogs this week, as we have this one today and our scenario reviews tomorrow.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>One of the tasks to sort out on my return involved confusion on how\
  \ we release Pathfinder Adventure Card Society scenarios. We decided to streamline\
  \ our workflow and move releases to the last Wednesday of the month, alongside our\
  \ Pathfinder Society and Starfinder Society scenarios. To get on this schedule,\
  \ <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq021d5?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Society-63-Fortress-of-Ruin\"\
  >Pathfinder Adventure Card Society #6-3: Fortress of Ruin</a>, releases tomorrow,\
  \ November 20th. An story independent adventure, <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq021w2?PACS-Adventure-1-A-Night-at-Bloodthorne-Manor\"\
  >Pathfinder Adventure Card Society #1: A Night in Bloodthorne Manor</a>, releases\
  \ December 18th, just in time to play it over the holiday season. The next installment\
  \ in the Year of Rotting Ruin debuts end of February 2020 and we will be on a mostly\
  \ every other month schedule from that point. We hope having a regular release cycle\
  \ will assist event organizers and gaming groups in scheduling their games.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Last, but definitely not least, the organized play team hired a new\
  \ developer, which brings us back up to pre-Gen Con strength! It gives us great\
  \ pleasure to have <b>James Case</b> join our team. James comes to us from the Paizo\
  \ editing department, where he’s wielded his skill with words nimbly for some time.\
  \ We look forward to utilizing his word skills, excel mastery, and ideas in organized\
  \ play land. Plans are for James to focus on Pathfinder Society, working with Michael\
  \ Sayre, but you know the saying about the best laid plans. Yeah, that one. So,\
  \ who knows what we will wind up with! You can learn more about the newest organized\
  \ play developer in a self-authored blog coming the second Wednesday of December.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>So without further ado, I turn to our regular features.</p> \n     <h2>Campaign\
  \ Coins</h2> \n     <p>While at PaizoCon Asia-Pacific, two individuals received\
  \ campaign coins in recognition for their ongoing contributions to our organized\
  \ play programs. Both currently volunteer as Venture-Captains for their cities.\
  \ In addition, they travel extensively as GMs and participate in the online community.\
  \ Please take a moment to congratulate the following community members for their\
  \ efforts on behalf of our gaming community and congratulate them on receiving new\
  \ Org Play numbers!</p> \n     <table width=\"500\" align=\"center\"> \n      <tbody>\n\
  \       <tr>\n        <td width=\"50%\"><strong>Recipient</strong></td>\n      \
  \  <td><strong>Org Play Number</strong></td>\n       </tr> \n       <tr>\n     \

  \     </table> \n     <h2>Stars</h2> \n     <p>While the launch of Pathfinder (second\
  \ edition) means less games run under the first edition rules, we still had a couple\
  \ GMs complete the requirements earn their 5th GM star. To achieve this milestone,\
  \ they ran 150 games, including 50 unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios, as\
  \ well as ran a game for a venture-captain. A conservative estimate of time needed\
  \ to reach 5-stars is 650 hours! Thank you to the GMs listed below for their time\
  \ and service on behalf of the Pathfinder Society! We appreciate you very much.\
  \ Huzzah on their achievement!</p> \n     <p>Timothy Stapleton<br> Kirill Storm\
  \ </p> \n     <h2>Novas &amp; Glyphs</h2> \n     <p>Lots of Paizo.com updates and\
  \ new tools, so moving one step closer to getting Nova’s automated. Until then,\
  \ please email evaluation submissions to <a href=\"mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com\"\
  >organizedplay@paizo.com</a> for collation.</p> \n     <p>Once we get the right\
  \ graphics updated, you’ll see glyphs appearing on the website. Unfortunately, I’\
  m not a web programmer, so our request is reliant on tech help, and they’ve been\
  \ busy with quite a few updates (you may have seen a few of them). We will get this\
  \ resolved shortly and update the organized play ID card to reflect all three programs.</p>\
  \ \n     <h2>Convention Listing</h2> \n     <p>Though the year draws to a close,\
  \ convention season hasn’t wrapped up! You can play in Society games at any of the\
  \ conventions listed below! The list includes all events requesting support as of\
  \ 15 November. If you see one missing, ping the organizer and have them submit a\
  \ request for support or have them email me at organizedplay@paizo.com to discuss\
  \ their event. All of the conventions on the list maintain some type of web presence,\
  \ be it website, social media page, or Warhorn listing, so if you are interested\
  \ in attending in either capacity, check out their websites or contact the local\
  \ venture-officer for more information!</p> \n     <table width=\"800\"> \n    \
