  \ itemprop=\"articlebody\"> \n     <p>Dear Reader,</p> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\"\
  >The light from Aldebaran and the songs from the Hyades fall upon our brittle planet,\
  \ and I'm pleased to share with you that in the coming weeks the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/strangeAeons\"\
  >Strange Aeons Adventure Path</a> will be slinking out of our warehouse and making\
  \ its way into game stores, distributors' warehouses, and your homes. After much\
  \ research and many an occult ritual, this Adventure Path steeped in the cosmic\
  \ horror of the Elder Mythos has broken free from the Dreamlands and become a reality—\
  a sentient thing, perhaps.</p> \n     <p>Now, this is no reason for concern. I assure\
  \ you that the Strange Aeons Adventure Path is fairly benign. You will not go mad\
  \ from reading it; the books won't flap themselves from your shelf and scuttle about\
  \ your home in the stygian hours of the night while you slumber—dreaming of things\
  \ far more horrific, no doubt. It will, however, provide hours and hours of creepy\
  \ excitement for you and your friends.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n\

  \   <p>While this Adventure Path is perfect for experts on the Lovecraft Mythos,\
  \ don't feel like Strange Aeons isn't for you if you're not familiar with or well\
  \ versed in the literature that provides the inspiration for this campaign. If you\
  \ enjoy creepy cultists, bizarre monsters, forgotten lore, and accursed locations,\
  \ Strange Aeons is a good fit for you.</p> \n     <p>I will, however, bestow upon\
  \ you a small warning that this campaign starts off in an atypical way, perhaps\
  \ our most non-standard Adventure Path opening to date. The characters wake up in\
  \ an asylum with no memory of how they got there and only hazy recollections of\
  \ who they are. This kind of start requires a fair amount of trust of the GM and\
  \ of the Adventure Path. You can still create a character with a complete backstory,\
  \ but know that some things happened in your character's past that are beyond his\
  \ or her control. The upcoming Strange Aeons Player's Guide provides advice on how\
  \ to make the best of this strange (but fun) situation.</p> \n     <p>If you are\
  \ eager to play through or run the Strange Aeons and want to gather some associated\
  \ materials to help spice up your campaign, consider checking out some of the following\
  \ items. As this is a cosmic horror campaign, picking up the newly released <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9n5a\"><em>Pathfinder RPG Horror Adventures</em></a> is a great idea.\
  \ In addition to great advice on running horror games, the book provides plenty\
  \ of great character options for GMs and players both. I also advise using the new\
  \ alternate fear rules included in this book, as I feel it will really help set\
  \ the mood for the campaign. Similarly, grabbing a copy of <a href=\"/products/btpy9egu\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures</em></a> provides plenty of character options\
  \ and new rules that fit the tone and flavor of the Strange Aeons Adventure Path.</p>\

  ></a>\n      <br> <i>Illustration by Ramon Puasa Jr.</i>\n     </div> \n     <p>Strange\
  \ Aeons kicks off with <a href=\"/products/btpy9nry\"><em>Pathfinder Adventure Path\
  \ #109: In Search of Sanity</em></a> by our own Editor-In-Chief F. Wesley Schneider,\
  \ who puts his own brand of horror on the Adventure Path right out of the gate.\
  \ I cornered him in his office and got him to jot down a few thoughts about his\
  \ opening adventure.</p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p>\"As soon as it was clear\
  \ that we were returning to Ustalav, I was pretty vocal that I wanted in. <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8j5u\"><em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Rule of Fear</em></a> established\
  \ Versex county as Lovecraft country, and Thrushmoor already had dozens of threads\
  \ dangling for cosmic horror plots, so I was instantly stoked that Strange Aeons\
  \ was going to be playing in that sandbox. The fact that the first adventure was\
  \ set in an asylum was just icing on a really big pile of also icing (I might have\
  \ written a couple of fictional asylums in past works).</p> \n      <p>Now, it's\
  \ been nearly a year since I wrapped up work on In Search of Sanity. I wrote it\
  \ on something of a binge after finishing my novel, <a href=\"/products/btpy9e43\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Tales: Bloodbound</em></a> (also set in Ustalav), and the first\
  \ volume of Hell's Vengeance, <a href=\"/products/btpy9j6n\">\"The Hellfire Compact.\"\
  </a> As a result, \"In Search of Sanity\" features as few subtle nods to both. I\
  \ won't give away too much, but if you're interested in learning more about Ustalav's\
  \ royal accusers or about the tribulations of Longacre's Lieklan family, the first\
  \ Strange Aeons has more to say.</p> \n      <p>You'll also have the chance to join\
  \ an asylum revolt, surf a blood tsunami and give a ghoul a shower.</p> \n     \
  \ <p>I seem to remember that some Lovecrafty stuff happens too.</p> \n      <p>Y'all\
  \ like bholes, right?\"</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>If you're eager to get\
  \ into the right feel for Strange Aeons and want to do some reading, I've compiled\
  \ a brief reading list of some of the stories that capture the feel of and have\
  \ inspired the Strange Aeons Adventure Path.</p> \n     <ul>\n      <li>\"The Shadow\
  \ Out of Time,\" by H. P. Lovecraft</li> \n      <li>\"The Dunwich Horror,\" by\
  \ H. P. Lovecraft</li> \n      <li>\"At the Mountains of Madness,\" by H. P. Lovecraft</li>\
  \ \n      <li>\"The Call of Cthulhu,\" by H. P. Lovecraft</li> \n      <li>\"Dream\
  \ Quest of Unknown Kadath,\" by H. P. Lovecraft</li> \n      <li>\"The Doom that\
  \ Came to Sarnath,\" by H. P. Lovecraft</li> \n      <li>\"The Repairer of Reputations,\"\
  \ by Robert Chambers</li> \n      <li>\"The Yellow Sign,\" by Robert Chambers</li>\
  \ \n      <li>\"The Great God Pan,\" by Arthur Machen</li> \n      <li>\"The Wendigo,\"\
  \ by Algernon Blackwood</li> \n      <li>\"The Willows,\" by Algernon Blackwood</li>\
  \ \n      <li>\"The House on the Borderland,\" by William Hope Hodgson</li>\n  \
  \   </ul> \n     <p>In a few short weeks the ritual to properly summon the <a href=\"\
  /pathfinder/adventurePath/strangeAeons\">Strange Aeons Adventure Path</a> will be\
  \ complete! Keep your eyes on this blog for the Strange Aeons Player's Guide, which\
  \ you will see soon enough.</p> \n     <p>Adam Daigle<br> <i>Developer</i></p> \n\
