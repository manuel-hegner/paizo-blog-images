  \ Without End...</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, July 29, 2008</p> \n   <p>In\
  \ my last blog post, I talked at length about how excited I am to see the authors\
  \ in <i><a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy80ht\">Worlds of Their Own</a></i>—all\
  \ of whom have made a considerable splash in the fantasy genre through their shared-world\
  \ fiction—turned loose to write in settings entirely of their own devising, in which\
  \ their word is the only law and all the toys are theirs to break as they see fit.\
  \ I also gave you a sneak peak at snippets from the stories by R. A. Salvatore and\
  \ Michael A. Stackpole. </p> \n   <p>This week, rather than gushing further about\
  \ the book, I thought I'd just jump right into the snippets—after all, anybody who\
  \ wants to hear my opinion (or express their own) can always jump over to the <a\
  \ href=\"/paizo/messageboards/paizoPublishing/planetStories/general\">Planet Stories\
  \ messageboards</a> and chat with me, Erik, and the rest of the crew at their leisure.\
  \ </p> \n   <p>So without further ado, I'd like to introduce <b>Jeff Grubb</b>,\
  \ whose fingerprints are undoubtedly all over your favorite game settings, regardless\
  \ of what they might be. In addition to rulebooks like the original <i>Manual of\
  \ the Planes</i> and <i>D20 Modern</i>, he's been heavily involved in novels, comics,\
  \ and design work for everything from Magic: The Gathering to Spelljammer, the Forgotten\
  \ Realms to Unearthed Arcana, Dragonlance to Warcraft. Most recently, he's been\
  \ hired to write the latest installment for the popular Guild Wars video game series.\
  \ Little surprise, then, that his fabulous story for <i><a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy80ht\"\
  >Worlds of Their Own</a></i>, \"Catch of the Day,\" is one of my favorites in the\
  \ volume. It's a fun, energetic tale of a world where humanity has been forced to\
  \ the mountaintops, sailing above the thick and dangerous atmosphere of the lowlands\
  \ in buoyant airships, and in which a certain naive scholar ventures off the maps\
  \ in an effort to discover the truth behind the phrase \"here there be dragons...\"\
  </p> \n   <blockquote> \n    <p>\"Fable,\" said Meridan. \"Saga. Epic poetry.\"\
  </p> \n    <p> \"Lost fact,\" countered August. \"I take it you do not believe in\
  \ the Lost Times?\"</p> \n    <p> \"If you challenge me to deny that man once lived\
  \ beneath these clouds, I will defer to your greater knowledge. But if you ask me\
  \ if I am a nostalgic, longing for the past, the answer, I'm afraid, is no.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p> \"I confess surprise,\" said August. \"I always thought of captains\
  \ as romantics at heart.\"</p> \n    <p> \"We captains are pragmatics,\" said Meridan.\
  \ \" You have to be, to survive away from the safe shores of the peaks. You cannot\
  \ long for the past, I'm afraid, so I leave it to the poets.\"</p> \n    <p> \"\
  And historians,\" said August evenly. \"So tell me, Captain, what do you think happened\
  \ to the world? How did it get like this?\"</p> \n    <p> \"It doesn't matter much,\
  \ does it?\" said the captain. \"The world is as it is, and we just have to live\
  \ in it.\"</p> \n    <p> \"I always heard,\" said Baker, \"that there was a crystal\
  \ heart at the center of the world, and someone broke it and released a cloud that\
  \ wrapped around the globe.\"</p> \n    <p> \"Nay, you're daft,\" said Crossgreves.\
  \ \"They had too much hoojoo. Too much magic. That caused the world to cloud over.\"\
  </p> \n    <p> \"You're both wrong,\" added Sandotter. \"It just started raining\
  \ one day and forgot to stop. It's just simple natural processes.\"</p> \n    <p>The\
  \ captain, pouring herself another mug of wine, asked, \"So, Mister Gold, how <i>did</i>\
  \ the world come to be wrapped in clouds?\"</p> \n    <p> \"No one knows,\" said\
  \ August Gold. \"But I think someone killed a god.\"</p> \n    <p>There was a silence\
  \ for a moment around the table, then everyone broke out at once. All except Meridan.</p>\
  \ \n    <p> \"Really,\" said Sandotter, with a giggle.</p> \n    <p> \"Now that's\
  \ daft,\" said Crossgreves. \"Begging your pardon, Scholar.\"</p> \n    <p> \"It\
  \ would explain why the Churchmen act like they have a wasp up their kirtles,\"\
  \ said Baker, \"if somebody killed God.\"</p> \n    <p> \"Not God,\" corrected August.\
  \ \"A god. There were many such powerful beings once, the old tales say. Only some\
  \ being of that magnitude could cause it to start raining and keep raining for a\
  \ hundred years, wrapping the world in a blanket of clouds such that the only survivors\
  \ had to hike up the mountaintops and start again. And only killing such a being\
  \ could release such power.\"</p> \n    <p>Crossgreves snorted, but Baker and Sandotter\
  \ nodded.</p> \n    <p> \"Have you proof of your gods?\" asked Meridan.</p> \n \
  \   <p> \"No. I don't even have proof of my dragons yet,\" said August.</p> \n \
  \   <p> \"I've been meaning to ask, Mister Gold,\" said Meridan. \"Tell me, how\
  \ do you intend to prove the existence of your fabled dragons?\"</p> \n    <p> \"\
  Why, Captain, I thought you had figured it out, looking at my equipment,\" said\
  \ August Gold calmly. \"I intend to go fishing for them.\"</p> \n   </blockquote>\
  \ \n   <p>If Jeff Grubb is the face of old-school D&amp;D, <b>Monte Cook</b> is\
  \ the cutting edge. The award-winning author of the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>\
  \ and <i>Ptolus</i>, <i>Arcana Unearthed</i> and his own take on World of Darkness,\
  \ Monte is one of the most respected names in gaming, a legend in his own time.\
  \ Now, in <i><a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy80ht\">Worlds of Their Own</a></i>,\
  \ he dives into the Lands of the Diamond Throne, the world in which his Arcana books\
  \ are set, in which giants battle dragons for control of an entire continent...\
  \ </p>\n   <blockquote> \n    <p>You said,\" the dragon noted, raising its head\
  \ higher, \"that you know who I am.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Oh, yes. Perhaps you thought\
  \ that such lore had been lost, but the akashics have made sure your crimes would\
  \ always be remembered. I know who you are, Nithogar the Wicked. Nithogar the Hated.\
  \ Nithogar the Despoiler.\"</p> \n    <p> \"These are epithets I must have earned\
  \ after I left.\"</p> \n    <p> \"Then how about this one, dragon: Nithogar, creator\
  \ of the dramojh.\" Out of habit, Re-Magul spat as he said both \"dragon\" and \"\
  dramojh.\"</p> \n    <p>Nithogar flexed his wings. \"You know nothing of it, Hu-Charad.\"\
  </p> \n    <p> \"Nothing?\" Re-Magul's eyes flared. \"You are ancient, it is true,\
  \ but I am no mere youth. I was there when the stone ships arrived on these shores,\
  \ one of the first off the boats. I remember the battles with the dramojh—the so-called\
  \ 'dragon scions.' I battled their dark sorcery and demonic powers. I saw friends\
  \ and relatives die in their claws and teeth. They scuttled out of the shadows and\
  \ they raped this land like nothing before them or—thank all the singers in the\
  \ Houses of the Eternal—since.\"</p> \n    <p> \"So your kind dealt with the dramojh.\
  \ I am aware of that. And you were some kind of leader in your campaign against\
  \ them. What do you want from me—gratitude? So be it. Thanks to you, giant, and\
  \ to all your kind.\"</p> \n    <p>And with a sneer, he added quickly: \"Now be\
  \ on your way.\"</p> \n    <p>Re-Magul recoiled. No one had ever spoken to him like\
  \ that regarding the hated dramojh.</p> \n    <p>The dragon pointed to the east\
  \ with a long, sharp claw. \" Your ancestral home lies in that direction.\" He lowered\
  \ his talon and added, \"I trust your vaunted sailing craft still work.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p> \"I know where my homeland lies, beast! I left everything and everyone\
  \ there to come here to deal with the chaos you created.\"</p> \n    <p> \"Really,\
  \ giant. Is that so? And what made the dramojh your problem? I recognize that they\
  \ were an abomination, but why do you, hailing from across the boundless sea, care\
  \ about such matters?\"</p> \n    <p> \"We are the wardens of the land!\"</p> \n\
  \    <p> \"We <i>are</i> the land!\"</p> \n    <p>The shouted words of both giant\
  \ and dragon echoed dully across the landscape. Each could feel the fevered breath\
  \ of the other. Re-Magul trembled with anger, while the only change in the dragon's\
  \ demeanor was an intensity of color growing behind his narrowed eyelids...</p>\
