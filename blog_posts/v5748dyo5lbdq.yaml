  >Tuesday, August 17, 2010</p> \n   <p>If you know anything about me (and I'm not\
  \ saying you should), you probably know that I'm Paizo's fiction editor as well\
  \ as one of the developers. What you may not know is that, in addition to working\
  \ on the campaign setting and making sure authors like Dave Gross are fed and walked\
  \ regularly, I'm also a musician involved in <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/shadowatmorning\"\
  \ target=\"nofollow\">various</a> <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/jamessutter\"\
  \ target=\"nofollow\">extracurricular</a> bands and projects. Usually that doesn't\
  \ affect my job at Paizo much, save for that one time when Jacobs and I, in the\
  \ first and only performance of Operation Banjo Thug, ambushed Wes with some impromptu\
  \ talkin' blues. (An experience from which he's never entirely recovered and which,\
  \ without witnesses, he can't verify as having actually happened.)</p> \n   <p>A\
  \ while back, however, Jacobs and I were sitting around after work talking about\
  \ what a Paizo theme song would sound like. We decided that it would really need\
  \ to have two distinct elements: a big industrial section like Nine Inch Nails'\
  \ \"Just Like You Imagined\" (<i>300</i> had just come out), and a classic, Conan-style\
  \ orchestral piece. And of course, no soundtrack would be complete without an homage\
  \ to <i>The Omen</i>'s big choral theme, which we in the office will forever refer\
  \ to as \"Sawhorse Middle School,\" for reasons I won't go into here.</p> \n   <p>The\
  \ idea never quite left my head, and a few months ago I sat down on a Saturday and\
  \ decided to do something about it. The resulting track was received with much hilarity\
  \ at the office—which was really what I was going for—and people ended up liking\
  \ it so much that they voted to use it as the theme song for Paizo at the ENnies\
  \ this year.</p> \n   <p>While it's hard not to be proud of the awards we won—Best\
  \ Publisher? Best Game? It literally <i>does not</i> get better than that—in my\
  \ secret heart, my favorite part of Gen Con this year was hearing the fight song\
  \ blasted over the PA every time someone from Paizo went up to accept an award.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Now that we're home, it occurs to me: why stop there? Hopefully some of\
  \ you reading this blog would be equally amused by the track. As such, I give you\
  \ my attempt at a Paizo fight song, <a href=\"/download/PathfinderEstDomine.mp3\"\
  >\"Pathfinder Est Domine.\"</a></p> \n   <p>James L. Sutter <br>Fiction Editor</p>\
