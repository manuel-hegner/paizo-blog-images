  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Wednesday, September 19, 2007</p> \n   <p>Having a product\
  \ go out of print is a strange experience. On the one hand, it might mean you've\
  \ done something right and your product was a success, selling through the entire\
  \ print run. Yet on the other hand, it's strange to think that something you've\
  \ worked on and put a little bit of yourself into is going to disappear forever\
  \ (except, of course, from the gaming tables of all those who purchased it, and\
  \ perhaps eBay or a particularly well-stocked FLGS).</p> \n   <p>Why do I bring\
  \ this up? Because as of this writing, there are only 52 copies of <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7ohh\"\
  >Map Pack: Countryside</a> left in our warehouse, and we don't currently have any\
  \ plans on reprinting this particular set. That means that when they're gone, they're\
  \ gone. If you haven't already, hit up the product page and see if your game could\
  \ use things like a coaching inn, ambush site, or roadside shrine. (The rope bridge,\
  \ in particular, seems to have generated a lot of excitement.)</p> \n   <p>After\
  \ all, you might not get another chance....</p> \n   <p>James Sutter <br>Assistant\
