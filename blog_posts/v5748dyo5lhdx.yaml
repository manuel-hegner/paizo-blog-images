  \ itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Alright everyone,\
  \ this is the last blog before <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy97vo\"><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Unchained</em></a> hits your local stores! Many of you have heard so far that\
  \ with Unchained, we’re encouraging you to really experiment and play around with\
  \ the system, so we thought we’d end with a bang and release information about two\
  \ of the pieces of Unchained that we hadn’t previewed yet as well as give you even\
  \ more content! That’s right, <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy97vo\"><em>Unchained</em></a>\
  \ was so full to the brim with exciting rules changes and optional subsystems, that\
  \ it couldn’t even fit it all. So let’s take a look at what we’ve got.</p> \n  \
  \  <div class=\"blurb180\" style=\"padding: 0 0 1em 1em;\">\n     <a href=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/150423-Blog-PZO1131.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/150423-Blog-PZO1131_180.jpeg\"></a>\n     <br> <em>Illustration\
  \ by Jorge Fares</em>\n    </div> \n    <p>First up is Automatic Bonus Progression.\
  \ If you’re like me, you’ve probably been annoyed at some point or another that\
  \ your characters more-or-less need to purchase certain magic items to keep up with\
  \ the game’s math, and those items are super-generic and just add numbers. Why not\
  \ take out the middle man and just give you what you need to keep up with the numbers,\
  \ thus letting you be creative with where you spend the rest of your wealth, on\
  \ fantastic and truly wondrous items. As the newbie designer, one of the first things\
  \ I added to any of our books was a subsystem to do just that, and the subsystem\
  \ in the book is an excellent addition to games that have low magic items as well!\
  \ There are even rules to explain how automatic enhancement bonuses on weapons and\
  \ armor will interact with special properties, like <em>flaming</em>. The system\
  \ in the book is simple to adjudicate and curbs some of the potential problems with\
  \ things like buying tons of different weapons with different iterations of the\
  \ bane property (or making special qualities the workaround to boost your numbers\
  \ ahead of everyone else, since you wind up making a trade-off). Take a look at\
  \ this alternate approach, which allows you to follow the same mathematical progression\
  \ for special properties, in exchange for using the table below.</p> \n    <h2>Magic\
  \ Weapons and Armor</h2> \n    <p>Magic weapons and armor using this system never\
  \ grant an enhancement bonus but instead grant only special qualities (up to a maximum\
  \ of +5). Any quality that costs a flat amount is unchanged, but qualities that\
  \ have an enhancement bonus equivalent use a slightly modified pricing system.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>In this system, independent magical effects on weapons and armor can\
  \ sometimes interfere with the process of attuning to the item. Therefore, each\
  \ magic weapon and armor has a capacity, from 0 to 5, which indicates how much of\
  \ a character’s attunement can apply to that weapon or armor. Any character who\
  \ attunes to a magic weapon or armor gains an enhancement bonus equal to the minimum\
  \ of her attunement and the item’s capacity. Increasing a weapon’s capacity requires\
  \ a crafting cost of 2,000 gp x the total enhancement bonus of the weapon’s special\
  \ abilities (and a market price of twice that). Upgrading a weapon that has a capacity\
  \ greater than 0 requires paying the difference in the cost of the capacity. So\
  \ for instance, a <em>flaming</em> weapon with capacity 0 has a crafting cost of\
  \ 1,000 gp. Upgrading its capacity to 3 would cost 6,000 gp. If the crafter later\
  \ wanted to upgrade the capacity 3 <em>flaming</em> weapon to <em>flaming burst</em>,\
  \ it would cost 3,000 gp to upgrade <em>flaming</em> to <em>flaming burst</em> and\
  \ an additional 6,000 gp because the capacity’s cost increases when the weapon’\
  s enhancements increase for a total of 9,000 gp. In total, this weapon cost 16,000\
  \ gp to make and has a market price of 32,000 gp. Armor works exactly the same,\
  \ but all costs are half as much.</p> \n    <table style=\"width: 65%;\"> \n   \

  \ There’s more! Early in the <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy97vo\"><em>Unchained</em></a>\
  \ process, we decided to give you tons of sample monsters that use the new system.\
  \ Later on, we realized that it would be even cooler if we also gave you step-by-step\
  \ explanations of how we built them, to maximize your ability to make more of your\
  \ own. You can guess what came next—explanations made each monster longer, so we\
  \ had to cut a bunch of monsters. Well, the mighty tarrasque has something to say\
  \ about that. It will not be chained. And while you read its mighty stats, here’\
  s a flumph with laser beams!</p> \n    <br clear=\"all\"> \n    <blockquote> \n\
