  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n     <br> Illustration by Kevin Yan\n    </div> \n    <p>When\
  \ I arrived back in late September as the new Pathfinder Society Campaign Coordinator,\
  \ I had hundreds of people requesting hundreds of changes to the way Pathfinder\
  \ Society Organized Play was run. It was definitely enough to make my head swim\
  \ with all the different requests and it took me a few weeks to get a grip on the\
  \ way change should be handled. Pathfinder Society has some very good things going\
  \ for it, but there were some rulings and fundamental practices that needed to be\
  \ looked at to see if we could make organized play better.</p> \n    <p>The first\
  \ step was to talk with Developer Mark Moreland. He was the current institutional\
  \ knowledge on all things Pathfinder Society. I rolled of out my list proposed alterations\
  \ and requests and we talked for the first few weeks about what could be changed,\
  \ what should be changed, and what should remain the same. After quite a few hours-long\
  \ meetings, we finally knew what improvements we wanted to focus on. I also want\
  \ to take a quick second to thank Mark for all of his help, not just on the guide\
  \ but with everything, in helping me to transition into this position. Without his\
  \ help, thoughts, insight, and advice, this job would be a tenfold more difficult\
  \ than it has been. Mark was the caretaker for a long while for Pathfinder Society\
  \ and I appreciate everything he did to bring it up to the level it is today. He\
  \ has more love and has poured more heart and soul into the campaign than anyone\
  \ else I know and I thank him for that.</p> \n    <p>After my list of goals and\
  \ changes was completed, I approached the Venture-Captains and Venture-Lieutenants\
  \ for their input. I felt it was important to get more ideas and different perspectives\
  \ from the leaders of Pathfinder Society. There was much debate and discussion.\
  \ Changes and tweaks were made to refine the direction I wanted to take Pathfinder\
  \ Society. After a week or so, we finally decided that most changes were in good\
  \ working order. However, we felt, as a group, that it was important to hear what\
  \ the fanbase had to say about such sweeping changes to organized play. We knew\
  \ that there would be people who were outright opposed to some of the changes while\
  \ others would wholeheartedly agree with them. Whatever the outcome, we still felt\
  \ it important to allow folks to have their input heard. So, I listed a series of\
  \ proposed changes on the Pathfinder Society General Discussion messageboard.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>After a week or so of listening to input from players, GMs, coordinators,\
  \ and store owners, we brought all the discussions back to the Venture-Captain messageboard.\
  \ We held firm to some of the changes we believed in, but altered other proposed\
  \ rules changes where all of you made very good points. Once we had all the rulings\
  \ in place for after a final review, I wrote them into the new <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/v5748btpy84k4\"\
  ><i>Guide to Pathfinder Society Organized Play, Version 4.1</i></a>.</p> \n    <p>I\
  \ will post a complete list of changes, additions, and deletions that vary from\
  \ version 4.0 to version 4.1 on the Pathfinder Society General Discussion messageboard.\
  \ However, I did want to list some of the bigger changes here.</p> \n    <ol>\n\
  \     <li>We added all current Paizo shirts as available for a reroll.</li> \n \
  \    <li>We have changed the way pregenerated characters work. Gone are the days\
  \ when playing a pregenerated character in a scenario for the first time left the\
  \ player empty-handed. Now, if the player is playing a non-1st-level pregenerated\
  \ character, he or she may choose instead to apply the Chronicle sheet to a newly\
  \ created 1st-level character.</li> \n     <li>We added a new chapter titled, Chapter\
  \ 6: Sanctioned Modules. There are big changes to sanctioned module play. Gone are\
  \ the artificial leveling up or down of a character. Now, the sanctioned modules\
  \ must be played by a character within one level of the module’s starting level.\
  \ I know this is not a popular decision for some. However, campaign leadership feels\
  \ this change is what is best for the campaign. Death and use of consumables now\
  \ have consequences. New Chronicle sheets have been completed for all 15 sanctioned\
  \ modules that adjust the wealth received to be in line with wealth received when\
  \ playing the equivalent number of scenarios. These Chronicle sheets are available\
  \ for download on their respective product pages.</li> \n     <li>We have opened\
  \ up play beyond 12th level. While there are no 13th-level or higher scenarios on\
  \ the schedule, a retired Pathfinder Society character may play and continue to\
  \ advance in levels utilizing the sanctioned modules. To facilitate the higher-level\
  \ advancement, the Fame and Item Purchases chart has been expanded to an upper limit\
  \ of 99 points of Fame and 800,000 GP. Guidelines for purchasing scrolls of levels\
  \ 7, 8 and 9 have also been included.</li> \n     <li>A section on alignment infractions\
  \ has been added.</li>\n    </ol> \n    <p>There are a few more changes and those\
  \ will be detailed in the post on the Pathfinder Society General Discussion messageboard.\
  \ I want to thank Mark, the Venture-Officers, and the fanbase for input into the\
  \ new guide. I think the changes are what is best for the campaign, will help to\
  \ strengthen the campaign for the future, and make the overall organized play experience\
  \ a better one for new and veteran players alike.</p> \n    <p>On a side note, the\
  \ guide’s numbering system is off due to the first season of Pathfinder Society\
  \ Organized Play being labeled Season 0. At Gen Con this year, we plan to align\
  \ the guide’s version number with the current season. Instead of listing the Season\
  \ 4 guide as version 5.0, it will be titled <i>Guide to Pathfinder Society Organized\
  \ Play, Version 4.2</i>. Once Season 5 is upon us at Gen Con 2013, the guide will\
  \ then be titled as version 5.0 and we will move forward from there.</p> \n    <p>Mike\
