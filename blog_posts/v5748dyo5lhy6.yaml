  > \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">It's a gorgeous Friday afternoon in Seattle,\
  \ and I'm on vacation. After an utterly amazing PAX Prime weekend in which we ran\
  \ more than 3,000 Pathfinder demos in four days, I'm exhausted and reveling in a\
  \ genuine four-day weekend away from work.</p> \n    <p>But almost nothing can keep\
  \ me from sharing my enthusiasm about our <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder\
  \ Battles</a> line of prepainted fantasy miniatures. Not vacation, not sleep, not\
  \ even my brand new Xbox One. I've got the goods, my friends, and I feel compelled\
  \ to share them!</p> \n    <p>This week started with a bang on Tuesday, when I returned\
  \ from PAX to spend a couple of hours looking over the paint masters for the entire\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9er4\"><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a> set of miniatures,\
  \ which releases in November. Sometimes paint masters arrive in the Paizo offices\
  \ a few at a time, but every once in a while we get the while thing all at once,\
  \ and it's possible to get a \"big picture\" of what the entire set will look like\
  \ all together.</p> \n    <p>And I'm here to tell you, the entire set looks GLORIOUS.\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9er4\"><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a> is filled with\
  \ useful figures, from bands of ghouls and bugbears to horses, bar staff, monsters,\
  \ and NPCs galore. On a production note, we had far fewer changes and comments on\
  \ this set than any previous offerings. From the sculpts to the paint masters, I\
  \ feel like the Paizo and WizKids teams are really gelling together better than\
  \ ever before. These figures sailed through our approval process.</p> \n    <p>Although\
  \ the set contains several savage humanoids, genuine monsters, and undead beasties,\
  \ the theme of the set emphasizes characters and creatures you might expect to find\
  \ in a fantasy tavern, the titular Rusty Dragon Inn.</p> \n    <p>We've already\
  \ seen tavern denizens like the <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lhkh\">Serving Girl</a>,\
  \ <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lhkh\">Merchant</a>, and <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lhpe\"\
  >Half-Elf Bard</a>, but that <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lhnv\">Dancing Girl</a>\
  \ we revealed several weeks ago has got to have something to dance to if the tavern's\
  \ really going to be a top night spot, and today's duo of previews is here to oblige.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150904-DwarfBard.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150904-DwarfBard_360.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>First up this week is the Dwarf Bard, a drum-banging buff-master\
  \ who marches to his own beat. He's also got a stringed instrument across his back\
  \ when the situation calls for more subtlety. He's slated at the uncommon rarity—\
  I figured two or three dwarf drummers wouldn't look out of place in a band of dwarves—\
  perhaps accompanying a noble or command unit. The Dwarf Bard is a Medium figure.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150904-ElfEnchanter.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150904-ElfEnchanter_360.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>This Half-Elf Enchanter isn't really a musician, but the way\
  \ she wields her wand and her fancy outfit give her the demeanor of an orchestra\
  \ conductor. During the approval meeting I put her alongside the set's other musicians\
  \ and the dancer, and she looked right at home. Her look—wild hair color and all—\
  comes from the <a href=\"/products/btpy8v3a\"><em>NPC Codex</em></a>. The Half-Elf\
  \ Enchanter is a Medium, rare figure.</p> \n    <p>That's it for previews this week.\
  \ I wish I could tell you about our in-office meeting with WizKids's president on\
  \ Wednesday afternoon, and about the absolutely amazing ideas and developments we\
  \ discussed there, but it's getting late, and after all, I am supposed to be on\
  \ vacation today.</p> \n    <p>It'll have to wait for future Friday Publisher Previews!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Until then, I remain...</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p>\
