               <p itemprop="description">Every year goes by so quickly, yet every year I end up looking back and realizing just how long it's been—and how much we've accomplished—since January. 2017's no exception. All the work that went into getting Starfinder Society going, we've been keeping busy bringing you more stories, adventures, art, and memories in Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild. While we've enjoyed all of the scenarios, there's a handful that I feel really defined 2017.</p> 
               <p>This year we tried something new: publishing a new series of quests mid-season. <a href="/products/btpy9qcb?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-816-House-of-Harmonious-Wisdom"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-16: House of Harmonious Wisdom</em></a> really knocked it out of the park, and the positive feedback has encouraged use to launch a similar series in early 2018.</p> 
               <p>Season 8 was our opportunity to travel to the elemental planes, and we scheduled two scenarios on each plane with an aim to present one urban adventure and one "wilderness" adventure. To me, <a href="/products/btpy9reu?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-819-Treacherous-Waves"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-19: Treacherous Waves</em></a> by Eleanor Ferron really captured the flavor of the elemental planes and of Vialesk, the foremost city on the Plane of Water, with colorful characters and daring scenes that flit between dry and wet environments.</p>

               </div> 
               <p>Every season comes to an end, and we try to bring everything together with a bang—often in a confrontation with loathsome foes. Ever since the "All for Immortality" series, we've scheduled at least one Tier 12+ scenario per season. For Season 8 we knew our goal from the very beginning, and we knew it was a worthy challenge for our seeker-level characters: break open the Untouchable Opal and free the being trapped within. The result, <a href="/products/btpy9tl9?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-825-Unleashing-the-Untouchable"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-25: Unleashing the Untouchable</em></a>, is a truly epic adventure by Robert Brookes.</p> 
               <p>Multi-table interactive specials are pretty great, but they're also an immense amount of work to assemble. To both deliver more multi-table content and change up our traditional format, we created a "modular special" with easily replaced parts that we can swap out with new content over time. <a href="/products/btpy9s15?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-899-The-Solstice-Scar-Version-A"><em>Pathfinder Society Special #8-99: The Solstice Scar</em></a> tread new ground with Andrew Hoskins as the author, and we've already finished the next installment that's set to appear at conventions beginning in mid-January.</p> 
               <p>Speaking of multi-table interactive specials, no retrospective's complete without the Gen Con centerpiece. This year Absalom itself came under attack in <a href="/products/btpy9tld?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-900-Assault-on-Absalom"><em>Pathfinder Society Special #9-00: Assault on Absalom</em></a> by Mikko Kallio, and the Pathfinder Society's factions pooled their resources and expertise to help fight off the invasion. This was one of the smoothest-run specials yet!</p> 
               <p>The Season of Factions' Favor kicked off with a trio of great scenarios, and one in particular really set the tone for Season 9. <a href="/products/btpy9tlb?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-902-A-Case-of-Missing-Persons"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #9-02: A Case of Missing Persons</em></a> by Alex Greenshields continues the ongoing saga of Major Colson Maldris, and the looks of disbelief I've seen on people's faces when they play this one... they give me life. The Liberty's Edge struggle this scenario introduces also kicked off our <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ljz1?Leaders-in-Liberty">Leaders in Liberty</a> contest and voting. I can hardly wait for the next installment in Spring 2018.</p>

               </div> 
               <p>The elemental planes have plenty of conflict, and conflict begets adventures. Heaven's a different story, as it's easy to think that no matter what happens there, a horde of archons is ready to jump on it. For more than a year we'd been considering an adventure in Heaven an unattainable goal... then we checked the reporting data for a Season 7 scenario and saw that participants had overwhelmingly chosen exactly that. Thus began <a href="/products/btpy9weq?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-906-The-Shores-of-Heaven"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #9-06: The Shores of Heaven</em></a>, a delightful and heavenly story that brought out the plane's potential in a compelling way with compelling characters. Cole Kronewitter did an excellent job.</p> 
               <p>Just as some factions are struggling with leadership or learning to flex their muscles in new ways, others are tackling an internal threat that threatens to destroy the organization entirely. The Scarab Sages got to show off their strength and destroy an ancient evil in <a href="/products/btpy9wer?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-907-Salvation-of-the-Sages"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #9-07: Salvation of the Sages</em></a>, one of the most extraordinarily fun and over-the-top scenarios I've had the pleasure to develop in a long while. Just as he helped kick off the Scarab Sages storyline in Season 5 and drive it forward in Season 6, I enjoyed having Matt Duval to tie things together with this adventure.</p> 
               <p>Ever since The Confirmation, no season's been complete without a new replayable (aka evergreen) scenario. Last year we published the first replayable adventure above 1st level, and we knew that this year we wanted to provide a similarly compelling mid-level experience. Brian Duckwitz delivered with <a href="/products/btpy9x0t?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-909-Beyond-the-Halflight-Path"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #9-09: Beyond the Halflight Path</em></a>, which delves deep below the eclectic city of Kaer Maga in pursuit of numerous objectives that change with each retelling.</p> 
               <p>And even with this long list I'm omitting tons of great adventures, from Mike Kimmel's trip under Merab's streets to Crystal Malarsky's archaeological peacekeeping mission to Larry Wilhelm's voyage into a live volcano to many, many more. What were your favorites?</p> 
               <p>Finally, no season's complete without some excellent artwork. Here are some of our favorites from 2017, compliments of Akim Kaliberda, Giorgio Baroni, Hannah Boving, Josef Kucera, Sebastian Rodriguez, and Tom Ventre. Also, although I don't want to provide spoilers by posting it here, we also adore Sean MacDonald's cartography from <a href="/products/btpy9rev?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-820-Torrents-Last-Will"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-20: Torrent's Last Will</em></a>, for which I've seen some of the most dazzling printed maps.</p> 
               <p>See you in 2018!</p>

                <p><b>Logan Bonner (Designer)</b><br> Most of my stuff that came out in 2017 feels like I worked on it a million years ago. I had a big hand in the underlying math and class design of Starfinder, and it was so much fun going into deep design and play with foundational concepts in a way we rarely get to do with the more established Pathfinder. I also worked up the monster creation rules, based on work I initially did for <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained"><i>Pathfinder Unchained</i>,</a> during the <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ssr?Starfinder-Core-Rulebook"><i>Starfinder Core Rulebook</i></a> creation process. Seeing them make their way to the public in <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujg?Starfinder-Alien-Archive"><i>Alien Archive</i></a> was exciting! And speaking of exciting, the highlight of the year was seeing Starfinder fly off the shelves at its Gen Con launch. I was there Thursday morning, went on my scheduled break, and when I came back, it was gone! Mind-blowing!</p>

                <p><b>Jason Bulmahn (Director of Game Design)</b><br> 2017 has been a truly exciting year in the game design mines... but as with most years, the things I have been working on have yet to even be announced! So, here is to 2018 and all of the amazing things I am looking forward to sharing with all of you in the coming months!</p> 
                <p><b>John Compton (Organized Play Lead Developer)</b><br> Although its copyright date shows 2016, <i><a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9qcl?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-113-What-Grows-Within">Pathfinder Adventure Path #113: What Grows Within</a> </i>ended up hitting shelves in 2017, marking not only the first Adventure Path volume of the year but also the first one I wrote. It was a great experience and a great opportunity to create some really weird characters (including Hoshbagh) and present desperate PCs with desperate situations. The process also prepared me for writing the second volume of the Starfinder Adventure Path, <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujm?Starfinder-Adventure-Path-Temple-of-the-Twelve"><i>Temple of the Twelve</i></a>, which let me draw on my archaeology training to invent a host of academics—both qualified and absurd—and a lost culture on a hitherto undocumented continent.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">

                </div> 
                <p>On the organized play front, I'm proud of helping Thurston Hillman get the Starfinder Society program up and running, especially in the changes we incorporated into the Guide (like the new approach to boons) and the plans we've set in motion for more than a year of great adventures. In the meantime, Pathfinder Society's been creating great adventures and accomplishing big things. In 2017 we wrapped up the Season 8 plotline, culminating in the excellent <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9tl9?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-825-Unleashing-the-Untouchable"><i>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8–25: Unleashing the Untouchable</i></a> that has ramifications across the inner planes.</p>

                </div> 
                <p><b>Adam Daigle (Managing Developer)</b><br> I had a hand in thirteen books that came out in 2017, by either being the developer for the whole book or pitching in on a book with another development lead. (I had a lighter hand in a whole bunch more, but those contributions aren't terribly noteworthy and are frankly quite boring.) Of all of these, I'd have to say that the one thing I'm most proud of is the <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinder/adventurePath/ruinsOfAzlant"><i>Ruins of Azlant Adventure Path.</i></a> This was the first Adventure Path where I got to fully run the show, so to speak. I got to outline the Adventure Path and form the excellent team of writers who brought it to life. Working with all of them was a developer's dream, and seeing this Adventure Path go from ideas to real books that people are playing and enjoying has been a highlight of my work year. I was also happy to get more information about my lil' fear babies, the sahkils, in <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9tok?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Book-of-the-Damned">Book of the Damned</a>.</p> 
                <p>My favorite personal development over this past year has been stepping up to lead the best damn group of developers in the business. I can't wait to share some of our efforts in 2018. Onward and upward!</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">
                 <a href="/image/content/Blog/20171221-PZO90126Foreword.jpg"><img src="/image/content/Blog/20171221-PZO90126Foreword_360.jpeg"></a> 
                </div> 
                <p><b>Thurston Hillman (Starfinder Society Developer)</b><br> As many know, this was my first year working for Paizo. I had been freelancing for Paizo for a while, but this was the year I took on the Starfinder Society Developer position and got to work on helping to build an entirely new Organized Play program (alongside Tonya, John, Linda, and several others.) It's hard to pinpoint a single "best moment” in this year, but I think I have to go with Gen Con 2017, where we officially launched the <a href="http://paizo.com/starfinderSociety">Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild</a>. Along with getting to see our new game in action, it was an incredible experience seeing GMs from across the world coming to help run the first games of Starfinder Society. Given how we've just announced several (but not all) of our plans for 2018, I suspect next year's PaizoCon, Origins, and Gen Con (ok, and SkålCon) will be full of new Starfinder Society stories!</p> 
                <p><b>Amanda Hamon Kunz (Development Coordinator)</b><br> Wow, 2017 has been busy! I've worked on a whole bunch of products, but I think the highlight for me has to be the Starfinder RPG. I really enjoyed working on some of the core system design of our new science-fantasy game as a member of the Starfinder design team; you'll see my fingerprints all over the <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ssr?Starfinder-Core-Rulebook"><i>Starfinder Core Rulebook</i></a>'s tactical rules, equipment, and magic chapters, as well as chunks of the character creation and setting chapters and beyond. It's very rewarding to see our game's positive reception among fans, and to be involved with so many great Paizo team members to help create it and get it out into the world. Similarly, writing the third Starfinder Adventure Path volume, <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9xa2?Starfinder-Adventure-Path-Splintered-Worlds"><i>Splintered Worlds</i></a>, was also a huge highlight of 2017 for me. I had a ton of fun creating the creepy atmospheres and plots that pervade that adventure, from a Dead Space-inspired cultist base to macabre adventures among the undead residents of Eox. I'll avoid spoilers and stop there! Regardless, a lot happened in 2017, and it's exciting to think about what 2018 may bring.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">

                </div> 
                <p><b>Jason Keeley (Developer)</b><br> Of course, I am very proud about the release of Starfinder, whose popularity has surpassed all of our expectations. But while we were putting the finish touches of the <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ssr?Starfinder-Core-Rulebook"><i>Starfinder Core Rulebook</i></a>, I was already up to my waist in <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujg?Starfinder-Alien-Archive"><i>Alien Archive</i></a>, corralling most of those weird beasties and fascinating aliens. I couldn't be more excited to have worked on a roleplaying game where a party can consist of a floating jellyfish being, an albino minotaur, a humongous brain, and a lizard person that can shoot blood out of her eye! On a personal note, I am also thrilled to have written the articles on Hadregash and Cyth-V'sug that appeared in the <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinder/adventurePath/ironfangInvasion">Ironfang Invasion Adventure Path</a>. Two different evil gods, but both so fun to write. And one of them let me indulge in writing some very gross stuff. I'll leave it to you to figure out which deity is more disgusting: the militaristic barghest or the demon lord of fungus and parasites.</p> 
                <p><b>Rob McCreary (Creative Director, Starfinder)</b><br> This past year was all about Starfinder for me, most notably the <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ssr?Starfinder-Core-Rulebook"><i>Starfinder Core Rulebook</i></a>. But I'm especially happy with <i><a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9tmf?Starfinder-Adventure-Path-Incident-at-Absalom-Station">Incident at Absalom Station</a></i>, the adventure I wrote for the <a href="http://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventurePath"><i>Dead Suns Adventure Path</i></a>. Besides kicking off the Starfinder Adventure Path, <i><a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9tmf?Starfinder-Adventure-Path-Incident-at-Absalom-Station">Incident at Absalom Station</a></i> was also the very first adventure published for Starfinder. The project presented a number of challenges, not the least of which was the fact that we didn't have the final Starfinder rules when I started writing it! But that didn't stop me, and it did give me the chance to bring one particular monster from Pathfinder to Starfinder—the akata, which I've loved ever since it first appeared back in <i><a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy85ed?Pathfinder-14-Second-Darkness-Chapter-2-Children-of-the-Void">Pathfinder Adventure Path #14: Children of the Void</a></i>. I also had a lot of fun designing the PCs' first starship, the Sunrise Maiden, which is the Starfinder iconic characters' ship too. I've really enjoyed hearing about people's experiences running and playing the adventure on the messageboards, and can't wait to see how people respond to the rest of the adventures in the Dead Suns campaign!</p> 
                <p><b>Joe Pasini (Developer)</b><br> In the first few months of this year, I was a contract editor for Paizo, hustling with a fantastic group of people to get Starfinder, a brand new RPG, out the door. Now, as the year comes to a close, I'm a developer for that same RPG, and I couldn't be more proud of the collective effort (including my small part) that it took to bring this game to the world.</p> 
                <p>In the summer and fall, I got to work with Adam Daigle, Crystal Frasier, and Amanda Hamon Kunz (listed alphabetically, because I'll always be an editor at heart) to put out a couple rad Player Companions (<i><a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujq?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Antiheros-Handbook">Antihero's Handbook</a></i> and <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9wzt?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-People-of-the-Wastes"><i>People of the Wastes</i></a>) and the back matter of the first volumes of the <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinder/adventurePath/warForTheCrown">War for the Crown Adventure Path</a>. Learning at the feet of such titans of the industry was enlightening, humbling—and frickin' awesome.</p> 
                <p>Here's to an epic 2018!</p> 
                <p><b>Owen K.C. Stephens (Starfinder Design Lead)</b><br> It likely comes as no surprise that the thing I am proudest of that I worked on in 2017 is Starfinder. My work on the <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ssr?Starfinder-Core-Rulebook"><i>Starfinder Core Rulebook</i></a> was mostly done in 2016, though some of that work bled into the early weeks of this year, but I'm not even talking about just the rulebooks. With Starfinder, I have gotten to be on the ground floor of a new RPG line again, and that comes with a lot of work beyond the rulebooks. I have enjoyed being part of planning a universe, and expanding it to new places, brainstorming new concepts and new adventures, discussing which of the things we don't have yet we want (and which we don't), and when and how to present them. I'm part of a brilliant team that's setting the tone and course for a brand new venture, and I am proud of both the work we've done and what we have in the pipeline.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">
                 <a href="/image/content/Blog/20171221-PZO7101VehiclesCombat.jpg"><img src="/image/content/Blog/20171221-PZO7101VehiclesCombat_360.jpeg"></a> 
                </div> 
                <p><b>Linda Zayas-Palmer (Developer)</b><br> I'm bad at picking favorites, so I won't pick just one. I'm pumped about Season 9 of Pathfinder Society, the Year of Factions' Favor, and proud of the work I put into building the overarching story. After seeing the reception to several scenarios, especially <i><a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9tlb?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-902-A-Case-of-Missing-Persons">Pathfinder Society Scenario #9-02: A Case of Missing Persons</a></i>, I'm looking forward to seeing what people think of the ways these plots in unfold later in the season. Another fun project I worked on this year was a pair of flexible <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/acg">Pathfinder Adventure Card Guild</a> adventures, <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9who?Pathfinder-Society-Adventure-Card-Guild-4P1-Murder-in-the-Marketplace"><i>#4–P1: Murder in the Marketplace</i></a> and <i><a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9xek?Pathfinder-Society-Adventure-Card-Guild-4P2-Dangerous-Cargo">#4–P2: Dangerous Cargo</a></i>. I play the ACG almost every week, and there's something amazing about watching my friends have fun with something I wrote. And finally, I would be remiss if I didn't mention my first published race: the vine leshy from <i><a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Ultimate-Wilderness">Ultimate Wilderness</a></i>. More leshys makes for a better game.</p> 
                <p><b>Mark Seifter (Designer)</b><br> "The math is going to be completely different, but also it needs to be fully compatible with all the Pathfinder monsters." Doing both of those things in Starfinder seemed like a tall order, so one of my absolutely coolest moments was when I plugged all the required constraints together, working alongside Logan, and tweaked all the variables along until finally…it clicked! I found an arrangement that would allow the brand new combat math, no longer balanced around making attacks at –10 or –15 at higher levels, to mesh directly with numbers right out of the table in the back of the <i><a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8auu?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Bestiary">Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Bestiary</a></i>. There was literally a single path to victory, a ray of light in the sea of numbers. I was able to lay it out, and sure enough, Starfinder characters have math that interacts completely smoothly with the numbers on Pathfinder foes, while retaining a combat dynamic all their own!</p>

               <p>I always get the chance to meet-up with Jenny at Gen Con, and knew before this year's convention that I wanted to give her a chance to write a Starfinder Society scenario. When we inevitably met up at the convention, I posed an open-ended question about what Jenny would like to do with a scenario along with some rough guidelines of certain tags she had to conform to. By the end of the convention, Jenny blindsided me with a fantastic pitch: "I want the PCs to have to manage and impress a rich socialite."</p> 
               <p>Taking some story cues from <a href="/products/btpy8wdz?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-4-19-The-Night-March-of-Kalkamedes"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #4-19: The Night March of Kalkamedes</em></a>, this month's Starfinder Society scenario requires a group of dedicated PCs help the Dataphiles faction leader, Historia-7. As the last faction to get a faction-tagged scenario, the Dataphiles haven't been idle, and Historia-7 has uncovered hints of a wider conspiracy arrayed against the Society. Her data leads her to Brilliance station, a space station orbiting the Pact Worlds' sun. The Society may not be in a position to break in and forcefully take the data they need, but Historia-7's found a weakness in the station's hierarchy: the reputed "king of selfies," Envar Tamm.</p>

                <a href="/image/content/StarfinderSociety/PZOSFS0107E-Envar.jpg"><img src="/image/content/StarfinderSociety/PZOSFS0107E-Envar_180.jpeg"></a> 
                <p><i>Illustrations by Benjamin Widdowson</i></p>
               </div> 
               <p>I suspect that Envar Tamm is going to be one of those NPCs that players just love to hate. Exactly why this is the case, is something I'm going to wait until players get a chance to try out the scenario. I will say, the art for Envar (displayed below) is spot on, and he's likely exactly the type of NPC you assume him to be from first glance. Jenny did a phenomenal job at showcasing a very different style of scenario than we're used to seeing in Starfinder Society. She's combined the high-stakes element of an infiltration mission alongside a cast of characters that are both ridiculous and completely plausible. In reading the turnover text for this scenario, I went into three separate laughing fits from some of the presented scenes*. So, it's safe to say that The Solar Sortie should be a memorable experience for characters and—while still a high stakes endeavor—an event that can bring some much needed levity around the holiday season.</p> 
               <p>This scenario uses the Faction (Dataphiles) and Starship scenario tags.</p> 
               <p>As a heads up, due to some space gremlins getting into the works, we're going to be swapping the order of our next two announced scenarios. This is to help alleviate some development burdens, and smooth the transition to some other (as of yet unannounced) initiatives that we'll be sharing in the coming weeks. So, expect to hear more about Starfinder Society #1-08: Sanctuary of Drowned Delight in my next scenario preview blog. This upcoming scenario is set to bring the Wayfinders faction back into the spotlight.</p> 
               <p>Happy Holidays!</p>

               <p>If you're looking for a frigid adventure to commemorate a northern hemisphere's winter, look no further than <a href="/products/btpy9x0v?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-911-The-Jarlsblood-Witch-Saga"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #9-11: The Jarlsblood Witch Saga</em></a> by Nathan King. This Tier 5-9 adventure returns us to the Lands of the Linnorm Kings, where it's the PCs' job to dissect—and possibly debunk—a centuries-old legend of a local bogeyman. The truth carries the PCs to a dying town and into the desolate taiga, and what the PCs find could change the fate of another nation thousands of miles away.</p> 
               <p>I'm pleased with how this adventure turned out. First, this continues the ongoing Sovereign Court faction's storyline in Season 9, and although <em>The Jarlsblood Witch Saga</em> is not a true sequel to <a href="/products/btpy9x0s?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-908-Birthright-Betrayed"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #9-08: Birthright Betrayed</em></a>, they both play key roles in setting up Pathfinder Society Scenario #9-13: The Lion's Justice (Tier 7-11) that's coming out in January. Second, I'm pleased to note that this scenario includes access to some fun gear from <a href="/products/btpy9tom?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Adventurers-Armory-2"><em>Pathfinder Player Companion: Adventurer's Armory 2</em></a>. Third, this scenario involves a major Lands of the Linnorm Kings adventure trope that I've wanted to see in print for a long, long time.</p> 
               <p>Finally, this scenario introduces our newest venture-captain, Bjersig Torrsen. It's bothered me for a while that the Pathfinder Society's presence in northwest Avistan is limited to Sheila Heidmarch in southern Varisia (and wherever her husband Canayven has wandered that week). Linda and I have also been trying to expand our roster of non-human venture-captains, and Bjersig brings the list of regularly featured half-orcs to two (the other being the popular Calisro Benarry). What's more Bjersig has a canine pal named Mahki (modeled off one of the Pets of Paizo, a handsome husky named Ajax) who helps the very competent and unabashedly deaf venture-captain navigate the hearing world.</p> 
               <p>And that's only half of December's new releases. Linda Zayas-Palmer, the development lead, takes over from here.</p> 
               <blockquote> 
                <p>The Pathfinder Society may have struck a truce of sorts with the Aspis Consortium in Season 7, but that doesn't mean that the Pathfinder Society will never again be at odds with their old foes. The Aspis Consortium has recently launched a mysterious mining operation in the Mwangi Expanse. Ever since this operation started, however, locals have been connecting it to all manner of sinister incidents. However, the Aspis Consortium's entrenched influence in the region makes opposing them a difficult proposition. If the Society hopes to uncover the truth without destroying the truce, they'll need allies.</p>

                </div> 
                <p>In <a href="/products/btpy9x0u?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-910-Signs-in-Senghor"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #9-10: Signs in Senghor</em></a>, a Tier 1-5 scenario by Kris Leonard, the Pathfinder Society seeks allies in the city of Senghor, a flourishing port that has long resisted Aspis influence. Fortunately for the Society, the mining operation isn't the only suspicious business linked to the Consortium. Hushed whispers on the streets of Senghor speak of Aspis agents lurking among the ruins of the forbidden and accursed city of Boali, whose mere mention is taboo. One brave group of Pathfinders is about to get a taste of the unknown perils that lurk on its uncharted soil, and in the process discover what drew the Consortium to its perilous shores in the first place.</p> 
               </blockquote> 
               <p><em>Signs in Senghor</em> also kicks off the Exchange faction's pursuits in Season 9. They may begin the season desiring stronger regional ties to Senghor and other cities along western Garund, yet as we look ahead, the faction will see more opportunities to wield its economic might less for personal enrichment but more to avert a disaster and effect lasting change.</p> 
               <p>What's more, we have illustrated another great venture-captain, Finze Bellaugh of Eledir, Sargava. I was delighted to see Finze portrayed in Pathfinder Tales novels such as <a href="/products/btpy9n4n?Pathfinder-Tales-Through-the-Gate-in-the-Sea"><em>Through the Gate in the Sea</em></a> by Howard Andrew Jones, and the venture-captain's a consummate scholar who exudes curiosity and understanding. We're excited to give him a proper introduction.</p> 
               <p>Have a lovely rest of December!</p>

            <p itemprop="description">The new season brings with it several Paizo-sponsored conventions with a large organized play presence. PaizoCon, Gen Con, Origins, as well as travel to other shows such as UK Games Expo, PaizoCon UK, and PaizoCon OZ. Planning for these conventions started several months ago. Over the past few months, Paizo staff worked hard on updating the Attendance policy. With it completed and ready for release, tickets sales are soon to follow. One of my goals includes offering volunteer slots for Paizo-sponsored conventions before the ticket sales open. This allows volunteers to make plans with their friends before purchasing tickets. Thus, we moved the call for volunteers from its usual February timeslot to today.</p>

              <h1 itemprop="headline">A Call to Vol—PaizoCon 2018!</h1> 
              <p class="date">Monday, December 18, 2017</p> 
              <div itemprop="articlebody"> 
               <p>In prior years, it seemed that we had a distinctive convention season with a slower period during the winter. This model doesn't work anymore, as PAX Unplugged extended the season into mid-November, and next year pushes it further back into early December, while Martin Luther King Junior's birthday weekend is the launch of the new convention season.</p> 
               <p itemprop="description">The new season brings with it several Paizo-sponsored conventions with a large organized play presence. PaizoCon, Gen Con, Origins, as well as travel to other shows such as UK Games Expo, PaizoCon UK, and PaizoCon OZ. Planning for these conventions started several months ago. Over the past few months, Paizo staff worked hard on updating the Attendance policy. With it completed and releasing to the public this month (along with updates the PaizoCon area of paizo.com), tickets sales are soon to follow. One of my goals includes offering volunteer slots for Paizo-sponsored conventions before the ticket sales open. This allows volunteers to make plans with their friends before purchasing tickets. Thus, we moved the call for volunteers from its usual February timeslot to today.</p> 
               <p>We have a few big changes from last year. We hope this streamline some of the processes or bring more options for attendees at the convention.</p> 
               <p>First, we changed the nomenclature from session or slot to block. Each block is 5 hours. This unifies the terminology from the event support form used by our event organizers and keeps things consistent across the board.</p> 
               <p>Second, we ditched using the Tier system to describe how many volunteers. It is a RPGA holdover that caused confusion, as the lower number the tier, the more slots a person volunteered. Also, we have tiers for our scenarios, so having tiers for volunteers caused some confusion in our data. This year, you register for the number of 5 hour blocks you wish to volunteer.</p> 
               <p>Third change is overnight madness! Following on the success of having overnight games at Gen Con 50, we are trying it out at PaizoCon. We will schedule some tables of Pathfinder Society or Starfinder Society, but there will be a limited number of tables available on a first-come, first-served basis for attendees wishing to play other games.</p> 
               <p>Fourth, afternoon tables may be submitted to the PaizoCon event system. When Sara Marie requests submissions from third parties, feel free to submit items for Pathfinder Society or Starfinder Society. Any tables not allocated through the system by the time submissions will be available on site with first-come, first-served priority.</p> 
               <p>Finally, we are setting a 7 block maximum for volunteering. We want people to take a break and see what the convention has to offer. PaizoCon is a celebration of Paizo, its staff, and community and we want you to experience different aspects of it. Oh, and eat. We really want you to have time for food, rest, and showers.</p> 
               <p>Last year, we utilized 78 GMs, Card Guild organizers, and HQ volunteers to ensure organized play activities at PaizoCon ran smoothly. I anticipate the same needs again this year, depending on how many blocks each volunteer requests. We have a few new choices for volunteers this year. As we are running overnight games, we will need a handful of GMs to run games through the wee hours of the morning. We are also looking for two HQ volunteers for the afternoon block to man the information desk and two for the overnight block, when they would be manning the info desk but mainly focused reporting prior blocks game information. Due to the limited number of places, space fills up quickly, so I recommend signing up as soon as you know you can commit to the event.</p> 
               <p>Volunteer slots are scheduled as follows:</p>

               <blockquote> 
                <p>In case you're new to our projects or what Order of the Amber Die is all about, here's a quick summary: We play the longest sessions in the industry, we've been through a couple of lifetime's worth of published adventures, and we like to push the envelope of gaming as far as it can go—and then some.</p> 
                <p>During the Adventure Path seminar at Gen Con 50, Managing Developer Adam Daigle said Paizo had waited ten long years to release an Azlant-themed AP, and despite not having much of a break after <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lk5x?Order-of-the-Amber-DieThe-Strange-Aeons">The Strange Aeons Experiment</a>, we couldn't resist the call to play it. Further, if Paizo waited this long to unveil Azlant, we needed to match the significance with something equally monumental: We would take our game on-location. Just as we started off “The Lost Outpost” with our characters approaching a beach, we put nine members of the Order from different parts of the country into a New Jersey beach house for many days of straight gaming. With this much immersion, the long weekend was bound to end up like an episode of Survivor or Jersey Shore-gone-Pathfinder, so we filmed portions of the escapade—and yes, we even did confessionals.</p> 
                <h2>Session Stats</h2> 
                <ul>
                 <li><b>Adventure</b>: <em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #121: The Lost Outpost</em></li> 
                 <li><b>Marathon Length</b>: 113 hours</li> 
                 <li><b>Session Hours</b>: 51hrs, 15min</li>
                </ul> 
                <p>We like to give each of our projects a spin or focus, and for The Azlant Odyssey we'll be highlighting the setting and atmosphere throughout. Submerged ruins, forgotten islands, lore lost for millennia—it's too exciting not to detail it as we explore. To prepare for the launch of this project, the four core players were assigned homework: to study the Pathfinder comics and master their iconic characters. Finally, with such a large number of colonists available for role-playing opportunities, our GM tapped four additional members of the Order for live-NPC roles throughout the marathon.</p>

                </div> 
                <h2>Highlights From The Lost Outpost</h2> 
                <ul>
                 <li>Our characters arrived on the beach to find the colony of Talmandor's Bounty deserted and the first wave of colonists missing. During our subsequent search, a distressed poltergeist sent our characters sprinting for the water quite a few times. Our GM ruled that since our characters were running from the grass to the waterline, we should leave our dice and make the mad dash across the sand ourselves. Harder than it seemed!</li> 
                 <li>Intermingling with the colonists and their elaborate backgrounds kept us right on track with reality TV, as we had two separate love triangles running: Anya Sandstrider the stoic Shoanti ranger with a crush on Harcourt Carrolby, the arrogant well-to-do, who was in turn the enemy of Leutin Calewick, the hefty blacksmith with a thing for Anya. That's all aside from the usual Kyra and Merisiel flame, where Ramona Avandth, the expedition's capable facilitator, added in some tension with Kyra while refuting the advances of Antona Sedgewick—one of the colony's most prominent soldiers. Can you follow all that drama?</li> 
                 <li>A self-controlled defense mechanism of ancient Azlant stalked the island, leaving ominous tracks that built fear in us until the confrontation finally occurred. It consisted of thousands of tiny spheres that could emit spikes and even knock you to the ground. Merisiel, our relic raider, had studied its path on the island carefully, and enabled us to exploit its weakness: it couldn't climb most objects.</li> 
                 <li>During an incident involving quicksand, Valeros the aquanaut pulled off his best rendition of Baywatch as he ran to the rescue and dove in with his swim speed, while we sweated round-by-round watching the drowning colonist. Even Merisiel was impressed.</li> 
                 <li>Author Jim Groves never let us get comfortable with the island or our mission, as this adventure tested a wide array of tabletop RPG skills: social combat from Ultimate Intrigue, roleplaying, investigation, traditional combat, underwater combat, linguistics, and even a player's ability to adapt to a new mechanic: "soft initiative." If the rest of the Adventure Path is anything like The Lost Outpost in this regard, we're going to find out what we're made of.</li> 
                 <li>Class was in session when we came across two celedons who wanted nothing more than to teach us about their goddess, Acavna. The academics in our group grabbed a bench and started taking notes, until our teachers casually mentioned that instruction would take years to complete—and that we couldn't leave until it was over. We brainstormed ways to cut class, but we were terrified about getting disciplined by the eternal guardians.</li>
                </ul> 
                <div class="blurbCenter">
                 <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderAdventurePath/20171216-CoralBay.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderAdventurePath/20171216-CoralBay_360.jpeg"></a> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderAdventurePath/20171216-Hand.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderAdventurePath/20171216-Hand_360.jpeg"></a> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderAdventurePath/20171216-Terrain.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderAdventurePath/20171216-Terrain_360.jpeg"></a>

                <h2>The Odyssey</h2> 
                <p>Sand, seagulls, and the smell of salt water completely immersed us in even the most nominal role-playing encounters. We also wanted to emphasize the role of sunlight in island survival, so as a group we decided to get up before dawn every day and begin playing with the sun's rays streaming in. So far, Ruins of Azlant is clearly more than just "the underwater AP." Survival has been the most important skill—used more often than swim—and both the exploration and discovery aspects of our Odyssey left our lore-delvers with plenty of knowledge checks throughout.</p> 
                <h2>Character Deaths</h2> 
                <p>None! We'll leave the credit to the preparatory underwater grid-training sessions run by our Player Captain.</p> 
                <h2>Best Quote From Marathon 1</h2> 
                <p>Valeros (needlessly shouting): Madam, your colony is clear!<br> Ramona Avandth: How much has this man had to drink?<br> Valeros: I've been drinking all day.<br> Ramona (to the party): Is this true?<br> Ezren: Yes, he has been drinking all day, but he can be trusted.</p> 
                <h2>Current Situation</h2> 
                <p>We managed to scout some of the island, but many questions remain about why the former colonists disappeared. We did rescue and return the original expedition leader, Rayland Arkley, and another colonist that we hope can provide more answers in the coming days. Between adventures, we'll be taking the author's suggestion of utilizing the downtime rules from Ultimate Campaign as we attempt to rebuild the colony of Talmandor's Bounty.</p>

               <h2>What is a puzzle hunt?</h2> 
               <p>A puzzle hunt is a series of linked puzzles, with the answer to each being a word or phrase. Those words and phrases are used in one more puzzle to generate the hunt's final solution. Figuring out how this last puzzle works is part of the challenge!</p> 
               <h2>Who made this, anyway?</h2> 
               <p>Why, that's us, of course! Both of us have a deep, abiding love of puzzles, ranging from crossword puzzles to the spatial puzzles you might find in an escape room or the video game The Witness. We figured we had solved enough puzzles over the years that we could design our own and present them in this puzzle hunt format. We tried to get as many styles of puzzle into the hunt as we could: cryptograms, word seeks, anagrams, etc. </p> 
               <p>The art for the Starfinder iconics featured in this puzzle hunt is by Remko Troost.</p> 
               <h2>What do I do if get stuck?</h2> 
               <p>First, put the puzzle down and come back at it in an hour or so with a fresh mind. Perhaps you'll spot something you hadn't seen before. Be sure to reread the instructions at the top of the page; sometimes clues are hidden in there! If all that fails, feel free to ask for a hint on the messageboards. There's no shame in getting a nudge from a fellow solver, and perhaps you can help her in return with a different puzzle!</p>

               <p itemprop="description">I'm very excited that folks are finally getting a chance to get their hands on the <a href="/products/btpy9sxh"><em>Hunter Class Deck</em></a>! Adowyn was one of the most popular and awesome characters in <a href="/products/btpy9h3j">Wrath of the Righteous</a>, and players have wanted to be able to play her in Organized Play for quite some time. Alas, there was no good class deck that offered a decent suite of Ranged, Divine, and Animal cards. Well, now there is, and Adowyn's going to love it. And hopefully you'll love the three characters in it!</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6825-AdowynCharacterFront.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6825-AdowynCharacterFront_360.jpeg"></a> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6825-Ambusher.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6825-Ambusher_360.jpeg"></a> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6825-Leryn.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6825-Leryn_180.jpeg"></a> 
                <p><i>Who's a good puppy finding all the monsters? You are, Leryn!</i></p>
               </div> 
               <p>As expected, Adowyn and Leryn are downright fantastic at scouting. Once she finds some banes, Adowyn is great at drawing more Animals, which power her exploration engine. With her Ambusher role, Adowyn picks up some valuable skills for sneaking and laying traps, as well as the ability to have a devastatingly effective first exploration each turn.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6825-KorundoCharacterFront.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6825-KorundoCharacterFront_360.jpeg"></a> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6825-DinosaurLord.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6825-DinosaurLord_360.jpeg"></a> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6825-Python.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6825-Python_180.jpeg"></a> 
                <p><i>He likes big animals, and he cannot lie.</i></p>
               </div> 
               <p>For our second hunter, I really wanted to emphasize the more savage end of the spectrum. Korundo was inspired by the <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/advancedClassGuide/classOptions/hunter.html">Primal Companion Hunter archetype</a>, with his flexible power feat representing his ability to channel primal power into evolving situations. Like when your python suddenly needs a second head. That breathes fire.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6825-UkujaCharacterFront.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6825-UkujaCharacterFront_360.jpeg"></a> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6825-UkujaCharacterBack.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6825-UkujaCharacterBack_360.jpeg"></a> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6825-Animancer.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6825-Animancer_360.jpeg"></a> 
                <p><i>1) Every Ally and Spell an Animal. 2) ??? 3) Profit!</i></p>
               </div> 
               <p>Ukuja is the latest in a line of <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lhem?Mikes-Best-Character-Ever-Darago">-mancers</a>, bringing all the Animals to solve his problems. That said, his real power won't necessarily be obvious until you look at the cohort line on his card list. Ukuja can really leverage the powerful cohorts in the Hunter deck to overcome the difficulty in each scenario. As an Animancer, Ukuja's got a thrumming engine of cycling Animals constantly into hand to solve all his problems.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6825-BeaststrikeClub.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6825-BeaststrikeClub_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6825-ThornBow.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6825-ThornBow_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6825-PolarBear.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6825-PolarBear_180.jpeg"></a> 
                <p><i>Wear protective gloves before handling any of these cards.</i></p>
               </div> 
               <p>The Hunter deck is full of all manner of weapons. The Beaststrike Club is one of a small cycle of Survival-based weapons that every savage character should get their hands on. The deck also has a great selection of Ranged weapons. And if you don't think a Polar Bear is a massively destructive weapon, say that to its face. I dare you.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6825-AnimalCall.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6825-AnimalCall_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6825-Klar.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6825-Klar_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6825-BlessingOfWindAndWaves.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6825-BlessingOfWindAndWaves_180.jpeg"></a> 
                <p><i>The deck is pretty much just tons of natural utility and savage boons (bones?) all mixed together.</i></p>
               </div> 
               <p>There are also a ton of other cards that nature lovers will want to acquire. Animal Call is a great Basic card to keep around, ensuring you have your best Animal cards in hand. Everyone needs a Klar to wear for any fancy Shoanti shindig. And the Blessing of Wind and Waves is Gozreh's gift to all, letting you designate a location for closing any number of turns before it's needed.</p>

               <p><a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lk8t">Unsurprisingly</a>, this deck includes another cycle: Aspect spells. Each of these spells provides a solid benefit for a full round of play and has the Animal trait, much to Adowyn and Ukuja's appreciation. The Headband even leverages a technique unveiled in the <a href="/products/btpy9s2e?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Pathfinder-Tales-Character-Deck"><em>Pathfinder Tales Character Deck</em></a> to let you wolf out over and over, in case that recharge check is tough for you.</p> 
               <p>Happy hunting season!</p>

              <p class="date">Wednesday, December 13, 2017</p> 
              <div itemprop="articlebody"> 
               <p itemprop="description">In Season 8 of the <a href="/pathfindersociety/rpg">Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild</a>, the Pathfinder Society set its sights far from Golarion. Pathfinders soared through the skies of the Plane of Air, swam through the endless oceans of the Plane of Water, embroiled themselves in genie politics on the Plane of Fire, and brought lost and forgotten secrets to light on the Plane of Earth. And while they were hopping through the planes, the Pathfinders ran headfirst into the plans of a group called the Concordance of Elements. The Concordance first came onstage as a fierce opponent to the Pathfinder Society, but ultimately became an ally. In the interests of keeping this blog low on spoilers, I'll just say: nothing like an angry demigod to help two groups set aside their differences. But what began as an alliance of desperation evolved into a genuine partnership.</p> 
               <p>So what is the Concordance? It is an ancient and diverse organization whose membership spans multiple planes, with a particular focus on the elemental planes. Its members take great interest in the interplay among the primal forces of air, earth, fire, and water. They believe that the stability of the multiverse ultimately depends upon these forces—and many others—remaining in balance.</p> 
               <p>Each member has her own ideas about how to maintain this equilibrium. Some of them set upon a perilous quest for understanding in places where elemental forces are at their strongest, from howling blizzards to ferocious thunderstorms to active volcanoes. Others seek to refine the balance within, mastering magical forces or fighting styles that evoke multiple elements. Still others search for yawning planar rifts and other massive disturbances to study or seal away.</p> 
               <p>As an organization, the Concordance believes that each individual member's personal journey of discovery is important. Its leaders, collectively known as the Cycle of Five, spend much of their time in meditation and reflection, leaving its agents free to act with relative autonomy. Of course, agents who contribute more to the Concordance's collective knowledge and overarching goals gain deeper access to its ancient reservoirs of elemental knowledge and power. Such ambitious agents would do well to seek out opportunities to make a name for themselves. Fortunately for Pathfinders interested in gaining influence, the Society's contact in the Concordance is a direct emissary to the Cycle of Five. He is our new faction leader: Ashasar, Liaison to the Seat of Balance, a Suli druid with an airship-shaped air elemental companion, as well as three other elemental companions who will be showing up in future scenarios.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PZOPSS0799E-Ashasar.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PZOPSS0799E-Ashasar_360.jpeg"></a> 
                <p><i>Illustration by Sebastian Rodriguez</i></p>
               </div> 
               <p>So what does the Concordance bring to the Pathfinder Society? It brings a fresh perspective on Golarion combined with a rich reservoir of planar and elemental knowledge. The Pathfinder Society has shown the Concordance that Golarion is a world worth exploring in much more detail. From the erratic magic of the Mana Wastes to the Abendego-battered Sodden Lands, the Concordance has just begun to scratch the surface. The Concordance is a nature faction, but it's not a typical nature faction. Its members respect nature, and typical nature-themed characters like druids and rangers are quite welcome in its ranks. Still, you're more likely to find someone in the Concordance trying to channel the essence of a hurricane than you are to find them attempting to befriend every plant and animal they meet.</p> 
               <p>If you're interested in learning more about the Concordance, check out the scenarios that have already featured their story: </p>
               <ul>
                <li><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #7-99: Through Maelstrom Rift</em> (6th-level Pregenerated Characters)</li> 
                <li><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-08—Tyranny of Winds, Part 1: The Sandstorm Prophecy</em> (Tier 1-5)</li> 
                <li><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-10—Tyranny of Winds, Part 2: Secrets of the Endless Sky</em> (Tier 1-5)</li> 
                <li><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-12—Tyranny of Winds, Part 3: Caught in the Eclipse</em> (Tier 3-7)</li> 
                <li><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-17: Refugees of the Weary Sky</em> (Tier 7-11)</li> 
                <li><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-24: Raid on the Cloudborne Keep</em> (Tier 5-9)</li>
               </ul> 
               <p>Since this is the Year of Faction's Favor, we would be remiss not to give our newest faction a chance to shine. We've got opportunities coming up in February for both Pathfinder Society campaigns. In Pathfinder Society Scenario #9-14, the Society will call upon the Concordance's expertise to investigate bizarre phenomena in the Verduran Forest. Meanwhile, in Season 4 of the <a href="/pathfindersociety/acg">Pathfinder Adventure Card Guild's</a>, Ashasar will help the PCs quell an unnatural storm. The Concordance will also appear in the upcoming Player Companion <a href="/products/btpy9xew?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Disciples-Doctrine"><em>Disciple's Doctrine</em></a>.</p> 
               <p>Interested in joining the Concordance? Ashasar is about to start an active recruitment drive, traveling from lodge to lodge across the Inner Sea and beyond. If your character would like to become a part of this new initiative, keep an eye out for the faction's formal launch in early 2018. As with other faction changes, you'll be able to switch your character over to the Concordance freely without spending Prestige Points. As a part of this launch, we'll be updating the <a href="/products/btpy84k4?Pathfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Guide"><em>Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild Guide</em></a> to include the Concordance and giving the faction a shiny new Faction Journal card.</p>

            <p itemprop="description">Despite their intended role as a secondary feature, there's no doubt that factions have become a central component of <a href="/pathfindersociety/rpg">Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild</a>—so much so that we made them a key fixture of the overarching narrative in Season 9, the Year of Factions' Favor. This season's a time for us to explore these factions' ongoing stories, and as is true for any story, the characters grow, change, and sometimes disappear entirely. In the past, we've handled most of these changes at the beginning of a new season. Not so in Season 9. We've been working toward a mid-season update in our storyline for some time, and I'd like to share three major developments with you.</p>

               <p itemprop="description">Despite their intended role as a secondary feature, there's no doubt that factions have become a central component of <a href="/pathfindersociety/rpg">Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild</a>—so much so that we made them a key fixture of the overarching narrative in Season 9, the Year of Factions' Favor. This season's a time for us to explore these factions' ongoing stories, and as is true for any story, the characters grow, change, and sometimes disappear entirely. In the past, we've handled most of these changes at the beginning of a new season. Not so in Season 9. We've been working toward a mid-season update in our storyline for some time, and I'd like to share three major developments with you.</p> 
               <h2>Liberty's Edge</h2> 
               <p>Back in July 2017 we launched the <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ljz1?Leaders-in-Liberty">Leaders in Liberty contest</a>, inviting you to send us a backstory for a rising star in the Liberty's Edge faction. We were blown away by the submissions and posted our top five for you to vote for your favorite. With your help and that of the winning contestant Sam Sampson, we formally introduced Karisa Starsight into the campaign. Most recently we shared that Liberty's Edge was in need of an interim leader, with the two leading candidates being Karisa Starsight and the halfling Tamrin Credence. Once again, <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lk9d?Leaders-in-Liberty-2">you the public cast your votes</a> and selected Tamrin Credence!</p> 
               <p>Three things in particular struck me over the course of these contests. First, these are a lot of fun, and I'm interested in exploring ways to include more contests in the future. Second, the voting between Karisa and Tamrin was quite close, showing that both of these figures really gained traction with sizeable portions of the audience. Third, the commentary (in-character and out) in the discussion threads provided a great insight into why each of the candidates resonated and what you hoped to see in the future. What was one of the most common suggestions? Co-leadership. Although I anticipate Tamrin will be the leader of the Liberty's Edge faction, it's clear that Karisa should play an active role going forward (much as Aaqir al'Hakam and Guaril Karela share management despite the former being the final arbiter).</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">

                <p><i>Illustration by Kenneth Camaro</i></p>
               </div> 
               <p>Either way, expect to see the next installation of the Liberty's Edge story in May at PaizoCon 2018!</p> 
               <h2>Scarab Sages</h2> 
               <p>The Scarab Sages came into being almost four years ago, formally replacing the old Osirion faction in mid-2014. The premise was pretty simple: recover a host of gemstone artifacts that store the memories of long-dead sages, recruit strong minds to host these memories, and revive the ancient order of Jeweled Sages. Ever since the Destiny of the Sands series in Season 5, PCs have exceled at doing just that, and I have no doubt that we could continue doing so for another four years. While some of our narratives benefit from such extended arcs, we decided that the Scarab Sages' story would be strongest with a decisive end. How it ends—whether the Jeweled Sages thrive as an ally of the Society or whether they fade into obscurity—depends on you. Matt Duval played such an instrumental role in writing earlier Scarab Sages scenarios that I invited him back to bring things to a close in <a href="/products/btpy9wer?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-907-Salvation-of-the-Sages">Pathfinder Society Scenario #9-07: Salvation of the Sages</a>. Be sure to check those reporting checkboxes—our hope is to have a canonical outcome by the end of Season 9.</p> 
               <p>So what does this mean for the future? At the end of Season 9, the Scarab Sages faction retires, and current members will need to change to a different faction. As noted on page 28 of the current <a href="/products/btpy84k4?Pathfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Guide">Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild Guide</a>, "any characters affected by faction retirement can retain any faction-based benefits but can't purchase new items specific to the retired faction. Such characters must choose a new faction at no cost prior to receiving credit for any further scenarios." In addition, members of the Scarab Sages faction will keep any benefits earned on Scarab Sages Faction Journal Cards, but once the faction's retired, they won't be able to fulfill further goals.</p> 
               <p>In the meantime, I encourage you to experience the Scarab Sages storyline in full in case you've missed a few adventures. Keep in mind that the Scarab Sages was also the first faction whose storyline we incorporated directly into the <a href="/pathfindersociety/acg">Pathfinder Adventure Card Guild</a>, specifically in Season 3, the Season of Plundered Tombs. In chronological order, these are:</p> 
               <ul>
                <li><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #5-12: Destiny of the Sands, Part 1: A Bitter Bargain</em> (Tier 1-5)</li> 
                <li><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #5-15: Destiny of the Sands, Part 2: Race to Seeker's Folly</em> (Tier 1-5)</li> 
                <li><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #5-16: Destiny of the Sands, Part 3: Sanctum of the Sages</em> (Tier 3-7)</li> 
                <li><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #6-04: Beacon Below</em> (Tier 7-11)</li> 
                <li><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #6-19: Test of Tar Kuata</em> (Tier 3-7)</li> 
                <li><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #7-04: The Ironbound Schism</em> (Tier 7-11)</li> 
                <li><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #7-11: Ancients' Anguish</em> (Tier 7-11)</li> 
                <li><em>Pathfinder Society Adventure Card Guild, Season 3</em> (Especially #3-3: In Search of a Sage and #3-4: Tomb of the Godless Host)</li> 
                <li><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-17: Refugees of the Weary Sky</em> (Tier 7-11)</li> 
                <li><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #9-04: The Unseen Inclusion</em> (Tier 1-5)</li> 
                <li><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #9-07: Salvation of the Sages</em> (Tier 7-11)</li>
               </ul> 
               <p>So that might leave a few of your characters in need of a new faction. Sounds like you'd appreciate a new option, right?</p> 
               <h2>The Concordance of Elements</h2> 
               <p>Pathfinder Society's factions cover a huge range of character concepts quite nicely, particularly for PCs who are interested in history, knowledge, and exploration. That said, the campaign's always struggled to accommodate one particular class: druids. I've struggled with this issue, as on most days the Pathfinder Society's interest in nature boils down to "that thing full of brambles and mud that we cross to reach the abandoned temple." Sure, the Society has its share of botanists, zoologists, and ecologically minded adventurers, yet that's not something that lends itself to sustainable storytelling. On top of that, there are already enough druid circles in the setting that we didn't want to add just one more to the multitude. No, we wanted something that we could make our own and have it stand out.</p> 
               <p>As we were planning out Season 8, we realized we had an excellent opportunity to introduce just such a group, an extraplanar operation known as the Concordance of Elements (or just the Concordance for short). The Concordance isn't your typical "nature for nature's sake" druid faction. Instead, it seeks out elemental imbalances, planar breaches, and extraordinary natural phenomena to close breaches, reestablish natural order, and study the multiverse in all its splendor. To fail in this is to allow rampant growth to choke out all life, stand by as one plane's power snuffs out the life of another, or watch as the cosmos spins out of alignment. While there are plenty of ways in which this fulfills the classic Nature Character's desires, I think you'll find that the Concordance tends to slap druids and fey on the wrist with some regularity. We're excited to announce the Concordance faction, and a blog by Linda Zayas-Palmer should appear on paizo.com a little later talking about the Concordance in more detail.</p> 
               <p>In the meantime, know that we'll be making the faction a playable option early in 2018, complete with new faction traits, a new Faction Journal Card, and a faction-related scenario due out in February. As has been the case with the introduction of other factions, characters will have the option to switch to the Concordance without spending any Prestige Points.</p>

              <div itemprop="articlebody"> 
               <h2 class="spaced-header-small">Mega-Regions</h2> 
               <p itemprop="description">Back in <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lk7r?That-Cantina-Feel">mid-October</a>, Starfinder Society Developer Thurston Hillman gave a sneak peak into <a href="/products/btpy9ujg?Starfinder-Alien-Archive"><em>Starfinder Alien Archive</em></a> and the organized play team's plans to introduce more alien species as player character options. We put our heads together and developed the Mega-Region plan!</p> 
               <p>Over the past weeks, we worked on implementing our idea, writing boons, developing regions, and identifying upcoming conventions running Starfinder Society. The only thing left is to announce the regions to our community. Please note, the Mega-Region is only a unit of accounting. It doesn't change anything about how our organized play volunteers are structured or the Regional Support programs. The first iteration of this plan will start with conventions this weekend. Sometime in March or April, we will rotate the boons around, so that each region has new rewards for their GMs. Future rotations will occur on roughly a 3-month timeframe, so that each region will get all the boons over the course of a year.</p> 
               <h3>Mega-Regions Divisions</h3> 
               <ul>
                <li>Mega-Region 1—Africa-East Eurasia (AEE) and Asia-Pacific</li> 
                <li> Mega-Region 2—Central Europe, Northwest, and Southeast</li> 
                <li>Mega-Region 3—Western Europe Middle East (WEME), Northeast, and Southwest</li> 
                <li>Mega-Region4—Midwest and Great Lakes</li>
               </ul> 
               <p>But a list of regions is bland, without the races to accompany them. So without further ado, here's the news you need to start planning trips around the globe:</p> 
               <h3>Mega-Region Starting Boons</h3> 
               <ul>
                <li>Mega-Region 1: Kalo &amp; Verthani</li> 
                <li>Mega-Region 2: Draelik &amp; Witchwyrd</li> 
                <li>Mega-Region 3: Maraquoi &amp; Nuar</li> 
                <li>Mega-Region 4: Formian &amp; Ikeshti</li>
               </ul> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7105-KaloDeepspeaker.jpg"><img src="/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7105-KaloDeepspeaker_120.jpeg"></a> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7105-Formian.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7105-Formian_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7105-Witchwyrd.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7105-Witchwyrd_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7202-Ferran.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7202-Ferran_180.jpeg"></a> 
                <p><i>Illustrations by David Franco Campos, Connor Sheehan, Matthias Kinnigkeit, and Pixoloid Studios</i></p>
               </div> 
               <p>When deciding how to handle the regions, we were left with our newest region, Online, as a bit of an oddity, as it encompasses all the physical regions. After putting their heads together, Thurston and John came up with a solution. Instead of being part of the rotation, they would get their own racial boons from a source other than the <em>Alien Archive</em>. In Thurston's words, "The online region gets something unique, while the value of physical regional boons won't be seem devalued by online availability. We think this is a good way to include the new online region in our program, and hope to review it in the future to see what other unique boons might be appropriate for distribution through our online region."</p> 
               <p>So Online will be Mega Region 5 and GMing a game online will open access to the Ferran &amp; Woioko races, both of which are available <a href="/products/btpy9ujm?Starfinder-Adventure-Path-Temple-of-the-Twelve"><em>Starfinder Adventure Path #2: Temple of the Twelve</em></a>. Like the races in the <em>Alien Archive</em>, a player needs to own the resource and have the boon to play the race.</p> 
               <h2>Starfinder Season Launch</h2> 
               <p>When the team looked at the summer convention schedule and what spinning up new seasons on two organized play programs meant to our timelines (and sanity), we decided a split release would work better. So we went looking for an event that our players could get to, that had the size and scope of a premier event, and that would welcome the profile of a new season launch. Our choice is <a href="http://originsgamefair.com" target="_blank"><b>Origins Game Faire</b></a>, June 13-17 at the Greater Columbus Convention Center in Columbus, Ohio. In past, the <a href="http://ohiopfs.org" target="_blank">Ohio Pathfinder Society</a> planned games at Origins. The same leadership team of Mike McNerney and associates will work with myself to bring you a quality, Paizo-sponsored event. Watch this space in early 2018 for the blog calling for GM volunteers.</p> 
               <h2>Starfinder Society Scenarios</h2> 
               <p>Since we rolled the Starfinder Society out at Gen Con 50, players clamored for more content. We've evaluated a number of factors in-house, including available organized play resources and current project commitments (more on this in a future blog). It brings us great pleasure to give our players a treat. To once more quote Starfinder Society Developer Thurston Hillman:</p> 
               <blockquote> 
                <p>"Two is a pretty cool number. I hear a lot of people talking about two in recent months. Lots of questions and comments about the word two. What is two? What does two mean to you? The dictionary defines two as "equivalent to the sum of one and one." Did you know that two is the smallest and first prime number? Two is also the only even prime number. Did you know that a honeybee must tap TWO million flowers to make one pound of honey!</p> 
                <p>There's just so many interesting and fun facts about the number two..."</p> 
               </blockquote> 
               <p>As you may have guessed by Thurston's fixation on the number two, we are pleased to announce an increase to two Starfinder Scenarios a month, starting in <b>March 2018</b>.</p> 
               <h3>Scenario News</h3> 
               <p>We are deep in plans for 2018, so I asked John and Thurston if we could give a few snippets of information about upcoming scenarios. In Thurston's words, "April sees the release of a new Tier 1-4 repeatable scenario. We've received great reviews on <a href="/products/btpy9tsw?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-101-The-Commencement"><em>Starfinder Society #1-01: the Commencement</em></a>, and knew we wanted to get another repeatable scenario out. As an added bonus, this scenario is also slated to include starship combat, making it a suitable teaching tool for players just learning Starfinder.</p> 
               <p>June brings us the release of a new Quest Pack. This should help the summer conventions out by providing further introductory material for bringing in new Starfinder players.</p> 
               <p>Our first Tier 5-8 scenario debuts in June. This scenario is the capstone for our ongoing Scoured Stars storyline, which began in <a href="/products/btpy9wet/discuss?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-1-05-The-First-Mandate"><em>Starfinder Society #1-05: The First Mandate</em></a>, and continues until Origins.</p> 
               <p>June (a popular month) also sees Starfinder Society debut its first interactive special, starting at Origins, with later appearances at Gen Con and conventions across the world. While this event is still being planned out, we are ready to announce that it will be a Tier 1-8 event!</p> 
               <p>While June is popular, we also want people to know that PaizoCon 2018 is getting closer. This year not only debuts Starfinder Society events at the convention, but also debuts a very special product. Four words: Strawberry Machine Cake Scenario.</p> 
               <p><i>*mic drop*</i></p> 
               <p>On that note, and given I can't top Strawberry Machine Cake, I'm signing off for this week. With so much Starfinder Society goodness in this blog, we are going to take a break next week, and return on December 20th. Next week's blog will feature some upcoming Pathfinder Society tidbits, since we can't give the Starfinder Society all the shiny new toys!</p> 
               <p>Until next time—Explore, Report, Cooperate!</p>

            <p itemprop="description">As I write the final "First of the month blog" for 2017, my thoughts roam back over the year. The Organized Play community delivered more games in 2017 than ever before—kudos to everyone involved! The biggest news of 2017 was the launch of our new organized play program—Starfinder Society. Though it had its hiccups, overall it was a resounding success. We are seeing players return to organized play, and many more who are new to Paizo and organized play are finding us at events around the world. Over the next few weeks, the team and I will write more about our thoughts on 2017 and what we have in store for 2018. Keep an eye on this space!</p>

               <h2>PAX Unplugged</h2> 
               <p>Several members of Paizo staff, along with a cadre of volunteers, spent the weekend of November 17th in Philadelphia at the inaugural PAX Unplugged. There wasn't an empty seat in the booth as we ran hour long demos using <a href="/products/btpy9u7x?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Quest-Into-the-Unknown"><em>Starfinder Society Quest: Into the Unknown</em></a>. We had a few repeats, but most of our players were new. The enthusiasm and excitement in the booth kept me going through some long days. A huge thank you to the volunteers that came out and helped, both in the booth and the organized play tables downstairs. We greatly appreciate your efforts in spreading the word of the Society!</p> 
               <p>Paizo and Organized Play are looking to return to PAX Unplugged in 2018, with more demos and organized play tables. Currently, PAX is listing November 29th to December 2nd as their dates for the 2018 show. Right now the plans are nebulous, but if you're interested in helping out in the booth or running Pathfinder/Starfinder Society scenarios, save the date and watch this space mid-year for more info!</p> 
               <h2>DIY Terrain Contest</h2> 
               <p>In August, we opened a competition for the best homemade terrain and in November, we presented four entries to our community and asked them to vote for their favorite. It is my pleasure to announce the winner! The competition was tight, but the entry that received top honors, or should I say honours, is <b>Chris Manning</b> from the UK/Online community, for their <b>3D ship</b>. Congratulations Chris! A huge kudos to all our participating artists, for their wonderful creations—Sam Sampson, Quinn Shannon, Scott Young, and Chris Manning</p>

               <h2>5* GM Recognition</h2> 
               <p>Our GMs haven't let up the pace in running games and several of them achieved recognition in the past month. We saw more additions to the Nova Club, as GMs ran and reported games of Starfinder. We also had several GMs completed their 5-star requirements for Pathfinder Society. The requirements include running 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 be special scenarios, but are not indicative of hours spent preparing for events. A conservative estimate of time needed to reach 5* is 650 hours! To those listed below, who earned their 5th star over the past few weeks, welcome to the club and thank you for your dedication to our Society</p> 
               <ul>
                <li>Jack Amy</li> 
                <li>Elizabeth R Corrigan</li> 
                <li>Andreas Frederiksen</li> 
                <li>Mario Grande</li>
               </ul> 
               <h2>Conventions</h2> 
               <p>2018 is filling up with conventions, thanks to the effort of our volunteer event organizers! Check out the list below for upcoming events with Starfinder Society and Pathfinder Society play. This iteration, we added a column of where you can find the Organized Play staff hitting the tables and rolling the dice.</p> 
               <p>While our convention schedule is pretty set for 2018, if you are an event organizer and want to invite us out at your event in 2019, drop an email to <a href="mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com">organizedplay@paizo.com</a> before next summer. We review our schedule in the fall and try to get all decisions wrapped by the end of the year.</p>

So, today I grabbed a set, along with some Flip-Mats, Map Packs, and some miniatures, to play around with.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderPawns/20171205-Image2.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderPawns/20171205-Image2_360.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>In this first picture, a few adventurers check out a dungeon room where some statues stand in alcoves and an open tomb is in the center of the floor. A 5-foot square pit sits along one wall, while a trapdoor sits on the floor along another wall.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderPawns/20171205-Image3.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderPawns/20171205-Image3_360.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>As they move through the dungeon, the adventurers find a crystal skull set atop a pillar in a room lit by a few candelabras.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderPawns/20171205-Image4.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderPawns/20171205-Image4_360.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Despite knowing that it's never a good idea to split the party, the rogue scouts ahead and gets ambushed by some goblins, only to find evidence of their last victim and reinforcement that goblins really like fire as the little buggers set off a fire flare.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderPawns/20171205-Image5.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderPawns/20171205-Image5_360.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Trying to catch up to his buddy, the barbarian cautiously looks at a puzzling rune glowing on the floor of the dungeon corridor.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderPawns/20171205-Image6.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderPawns/20171205-Image6_360.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>And the rogue continues to get into trouble, but thanks to his training he's able to dodge out of the way of some floor spikes, a wall blade, and a big crack in the dungeon floor. I hope that guy makes it back to the party.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderPawns/20171205-Image7.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderPawns/20171205-Image7_360.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>This doesn't look good. Those pools of blood in front of the evil altar make it look like the unfortunate rogue might have been sacrificed—or eaten—by these undead. At least they decorate their chapel with some nice columns and suits of armor.</p> 
               <p><i>(Not pictured because I only just now thought of it... When using some of the pawns for tables and altars, you could set them up on a couple of 6-sided dice to give some elevation.)</i></p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderPawns/20171205-Image8.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderPawns/20171205-Image8_360.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Remember those goblins? They decided to hike out to a farm to steal some pickles, but ended up getting into a pickle. Here they encounter a pile of bones surrounded by some vines, giving Reta the strong suspicion that there's an assassin vine nearby. Some mold grows near the haystack and a bear trap has been carelessly left in the grass. In the middle of the enclosure is a barrel next to a hole with some rubble. Who—or what—dug that hole, and were they going into or out of the ground? The real danger here is that snake swarm chasing them out of the fenced area. Run lil' goblins, run!</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderPawns/20171205-Image11.jpg"><img src="//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderPawns/20171205-Image11_360.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Lastly, the adventurers make it back home. The barbarian wipes his feet on the rug, while the rogue goes to sit at his cluttered desk (I have such a desk in my office, but I don't have a chest and some books and scrolls.) The neighboring room contains a clean desk (show off), a magic chest, and a lever. A scroll case sits against the wall in a nearby room.</p> 
               <p>These pawns can work well with Flip-Mats and Map Packs that already have furnishings. Since most furnishings already on the maps fit nicely in their squares, these pawns completely cover them up, adding versatility and reusability to your collection of maps.</p>

               <p itemprop="description">When setting out to write <a href="/products/btpy9wzs?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Taldor-the-First-Empire"><em>Taldor, The First Empire</em></a>, I found myself presented with a circumstance unlike any that I had previously undertaken: round up everything we've ever said about the nation of Taldor in the 10 years the Pathfinder campaign setting has been around, put all of that into a single cohesive document, make sure it's exciting and inspirational for readers, and lay the groundwork for a Pathfinder Adventure Path campaign that will take place entirely within the nation and deal with the inner workings of its government and long history. But if anyone could do it, I told myself in true Taldan fashion, it was me. Right?</p> 
               <p>The first major challenge was determining what tone we wanted to present Taldor with going forward, in part because we've been less than consistent on it in the past. Some sources made it out to be more like the Byzantine Empire, complete with laws dictating who could have a beard, while other sources described the court of Louis XIV, with nobles so incompetent that they couldn't even spell their own names correctly. The problem isn't with either presentation, but rather with the fact that there are a lot of fans of both sides of Taldor.</p> 
               <p>I spent much of PaizoCon 2017 chatting with the community about what they wanted out of the book, what they liked about Taldor, and what never seemed to make sense to them. The development team held a series of meetings wherein we broke down our own views of the nation and what we needed from it in the future, from NPCs, locations, and events to seed into the campaign setting for forthcoming adventures to even larger meta-plots. Then I took all of that and used it as a guideline when combing through the myriad bits we'd said about the Inner Sea's greatest nation to construct what would become the book itself.</p>

               <p>I'm incredibly proud of this book, and think the final result is one of the best entries in the illustrious Pathfinder Campaign Setting line. It will be headed to subscribers and game stores soon, and I look forward to hearing the what the community has to say. Check back next week, when I'll go over a few of the reasons why Taldor is the greatest nation in the Inner Sea, and enjoy these glorious illustrations as a preview of what <a href="/products/btpy9wzs?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Taldor-the-First-Empire"><em>Taldor, The First Empire</em></a> has to offer.</p>
