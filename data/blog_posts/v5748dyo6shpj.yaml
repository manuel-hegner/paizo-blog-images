  \   </div> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">“Are you lost,\
  \ child?”</p> \n      <p>Hioba stared up at the golden leaves and the large golden\
  \ trunk of one of Forest Agoyben’s famed Crackling Trees. The voice startled her,\
  \ and she spun to face it. A small but powerful woman whose face she could not fully\
  \ see in the shadows leaned against a tree a dozen paces away.</p> \n      <p>“\
  I’m... uh, no. Actually, I was here to study these trees. You see, I am a student\
  \ at the Magaambya and—”</p> \n      <p>“And you thought you’d learn something about\
  \ these trees that might just explode out of nowhere?”</p> \n      <p>“Yes.” Hioba\
  \ again marveled at the tree before her. The trunk had the same luster as actual\
  \ gold and felt almost metallic when she touched it. She’d heard about it in school,\
  \ but it seemed impossible to imagine such a hearty tree would simply... break.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>The woman nodded. “Knowledge is good, but experience is truth. You\
  \ know how the trees came to develop their ailment, yes? They taught you that at\
  \ school?” The woman came closer but still hid most of her features in the forest’\
  s shadows, where the light failed to penetrate fully. Hioba opened her mouth but\
  \ stopped when the woman raised her hand.</p> \n      <p>“What they don’t teach\
  \ you is this: Agohbindi the Splintering Child emerged from under the Vanji River\
  \ twice as tall as that tree you’ve been staring at for the last hour.” Hioba leaned\
  \ back, hands on hips, trying to envision the scale of the monster.</p> \n     \
  \ <p>“It rose from the river and grasped its way to the sky. It had a beetle’s iridescent\
  \ carapace but the hungering face and maw of a fiend. Its pincers could crush several\
  \ blocks of Nantambu’s splendid buildings. It sought a meal and Nantambu was the\
  \ closest, tastiest dish it was likely to find.</p> \n      <p>“Rovagug’s murderous\
  \ progeny crashed through the forest. The Tempest-Sun Mages almost learned of the\
  \ threat too late. Lucky for them a Magaambya student just like yourself tended\
  \ to his herbal studies and witnessed the beginning of Agohbindi’s rampage. He sent\
  \ a message to companions nearer to the city who relayed to the Tempest-Sun Mages\
  \ what occurred.”</p> \n      <p>The woman paused. “Are you taking notes, my child?\
  \ You are receiving quite the education here.” Hioba snatched a quill and her scroll\
  \ from her pack and started writing. The woman chuckled and continued.</p> \n  \
  \    <p>“Fewer than a dozen Tempest-Sun Mages responded, confident in their abilities,\
  \ just as Azure Leopard had taught them to be. At first their confidence seemed\
  \ well placed! Their first battle ritual created a storm, pulling the lightning\
  \ out of the clouds and hurling it at Agohbindi. The gigantic bolt of electricity\
  \ cleaved the Spawn of Rovagug cleanly in half.</p> \n      <p>“The mages congratulated\
  \ each other for the quick victory, but their celebration was cut short, for the\
  \ two halves of the beast’s foul body instantly formed into two smaller but identical\
  \ versions of Agohbindi. The mages hurled bolt after bolt from their battle circle.\
  \ Each bolt split its target in slightly smaller versions of the original spawn\
  \ until they could get no smaller, at which point they simply continued to multiply.</p>\

  \ 13px;\"></p>\n      </div> \n      <br> \n      <p>“The last act that group performed\
  \ was sending a magical message to Azure Leopard and Old-Mage Jatembe, a plea for\
  \ help. Then the teeth and magic of a thousand Agohbindis overwhelmed them.”</p>\
  \ \n      <p>The woman paused and murmured something that sounded to Hioba like\
  \ a prayer.</p> \n      <p>“Azure Leopard and Old-Mage Jatembe answered the call\
  \ and arrived with nearly one hundred Tempest-Sun Mages. They all thought they were\
  \ ready for the threat, but they were so incredibly wrong!</p> \n      <p>“Your\
  \ books and your teachers will tell you they fought Agohbindi, but what they tell\
  \ you is insufficient. Yes, they fought, but it wasn’t a mere battle—it was a grueling\
  \ war. They fought with the Rough Beast’s monstrous child for days on end. The Tempest-Sun\
  \ Mages fought at first from within the forest, but soon the forest contained as\
  \ many Agohbindis as the plains hold blades of grass. So the mages took to the sky,\
  \ harnessing the storm and the wind and the rain to at least slow the advancement\
  \ of the ceaseless monstrosities. They used fire magic to melt the spawn, but the\
  \ spawn simply reformed moments later.</p> \n      <p>“Azure Leopard and Jatembe\
  \ spent most of their energy coordinating the Tempest-Sun Mages’ defenses, erecting\
  \ powerful barriers that would take the creatures many hours to penetrate so that\
  \ the group could search for solutions. Trying to protect the warriors in their\
  \ care left them precious little time for strategy, but their dedication to protection\
  \ prevented any other warrior mages from dying. Even then, many suffered severe\
  \ wounds and none were the same.”</p> \n      <p>Hioba cleared her throat and looked\
  \ up from her notes. “When did Jatembe trap Agohbindi? What do you know about that?”\
  </p> \n      <p>The woman chuckled again.</p> \n      <p>“By accident! After several\
  \ days of fighting and containment, the mages ran headlong into that fact we all\
  \ now know: magic is infinite, but our capacity to wield it... is not. The Tempest-Sun\
  \ Mages had tapped into their reserves and beyond. As they grew more exhausted,\
  \ they became sloppy. Old-Mage Jatembe and his pupil found it progressively more\
  \ taxing to protect the weary mages. In hours, Agohbindi in his multitude would\
  \ have overwhelmed the amassed mages and moved onward to consume the Song-Wind City...\
  \ and likely the entirety of Mwangi Expanse!</p> \n      <p>“Jatembe and Leopard\
  \ were in the middle of conjuring a barrier of elemental ice for a group of mages\
  \ retreating from the Agohbindi splinters in the forest. Out of exasperation, over\
  \ the noise and rage of combat, Azure Leopard shouted to Jatembe: ‘Fighting Agohbindi\
  \ is not like fighting an opponent, Old-Mage! It is like fighting a tide, like fighting\
  \ water!’</p> \n      <p>“Just then, the teacher and pupil paused and looked at\
  \ each other, each knowing what the other would say next. Child, what do they teach\
  \ you about water at Magaambya?”</p> \n      <p>“You... don’t fight it?” Hioba answered\
  \ nervously.</p> \n      <p>“Exactly! You don’t fight water. You help it flow, and\
  \ then you let it flow into a container where you hold it. Leopard and Jatembe had\
  \ been so busy fighting and defending that they had missed this obvious point. Jatembe\
  \ let out such a loud and hysterical laugh that everyone who could hear it became\
  \ anxious for him.</p> \n      <p>“‘My own teachings, remembered in the last hour,\
  \ amazing!’ He laughed some more while weaving the spell he knew he needed to cast.\
  \ People would have been surprised by his humor, except it was Old-Mage Jatembe.\
  \ He was always a little unpredictable.” The woman shrugged.</p> \n      <p>“After\
  \ a moment, Azure Leopard saw her teacher’s intent, and joined in with no prompting.\
  \ Together their magic augmented the roots of the forest’s trees, which burst free\
  \ from the soil. The pair sent out magical messages to the Tempest-Sun Mages to\
  \ direct their energies into these roots. The magic roots stretched out of the soil,\
  \ wrapping around each of the thousands of Agohbindi shards, holding them in place.\
  \ Jatembe directed all the other warriors except Azure Leopard into the sky as he\
  \ prepared the next stage.”</p> \n      <p>Hioba had stopped writing, absorbed in\
  \ the mysterious woman’s story.</p> \n      <p>“Jatembe stretched his arms like\
  \ a yawn, letting the earth’s energy flow into his body. He inhaled a breath bigger\
  \ than Balumbdar, building up the energy in his hands and his staff. The other mages\
  \ worked on a battle ritual to summon the largest bolt of lightning ever seen… before\
  \ or since.</p> \n      <p>“When Jatembe finally exhaled, he sent magical fire into\
  \ and through the roots. At that moment the Tempest-Sun Mages and Azure Leopard\
  \ released their lightning, which snaked over and through the spawned multitudes.\
  \ Before they could grow again, the fire melted the spawn fragments into ooze as\
  \ they screeched in fury. The ooze seeped into the soil, where the web of roots\
  \ covering the entire forest drank it up.</p> \n      <p>\"When the screeching abated,\
  \ Jatembe stopped the fire. He and the other mages drew the roots back into the\
  \ earth. Agohbindi, which could not be destroyed, which flooded the forest like\
  \ water, was absorbed, like water, into the soil.” The woman pointed at the tree\
  \ Hioba had been studying. </p> \n      <p>“Into that tree, and the others like\
  \ it.”</p> \n      <p>Hioba turned around to look at the tree again. “Is there something\
  \ about the evil trapped within that makes the tree gold?” </p> \n      <p>“Ha,\
  \ no. Jatembe just thought it might make Agohbindi <em>furious</em> to be trapped\
  \ in something so beautiful.”</p> \n      <p>“Also... wait... how do you know so\
  \ much about this? How do you know this story?” Hioba turned back to face the woman,\
  \ who was donning an ornate leopard mask. Once the mask was on, she stepped out\
  \ of the shadows and into the light.</p> \n      <p>“Aaaaah, and here I was, holding\
  \ out high hopes for your powers of observation, child. I’ve given you the start;\
  \ now keep with your studies. Agohbindi will surely need to be contained once more,\
  \ someday.”</p> \n      <p>Hioba tried to speak, but Azure Leopard was gone.</p>\
