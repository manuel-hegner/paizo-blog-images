  \ \n     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Both in the office and\
  \ in our works, Paizo honors the presence of women creators and professionals in\
  \ our spaces. Today, we want to introduce you to a few of those fantastic staffers\
  \ and freelancers that make our games amazing! Some submissions came from the women\
  \ themselves, some from their friends and colleagues, and we are so very pleased\
  \ to share them with you!</p> \n      <h3>Tineke Bolleman</h3> \n      <p>If you’\
  ve ever been to PaizoCon, either online or in the flesh, you probably have a memory\
  \ of a friendly conversation or late-night shenanigans with Tineke Bolleman. Tineke’\
  s a longtime volunteer— she started in 2014 and became the Venture Captain of the\
  \ Netherlands region in 2017, to be exact—and is a positive force for change, inclusion,\
  \ and welcoming others into our shared spaces.<br> After years of serving our community\
  \ as a volunteer, Tineke started freelancing for Paizo. She’s an author for Starfinder\
  \ Society scenario’s <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpya08w?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-116-Dreaming-of-the-Future\"\
  >#1-16: Dreaming of the Future</a> and <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01va4?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-124-Siege-of-Enlightenment\"\
  >#1-24:Siege of Enlightenment</a> as well as Pathfinder Society scenario’s <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/products/btq0217l?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-105-Trailblazers-Bounty\"\
  >#1-05: Trailblazers’ Bounty</a> and <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq024zi?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-203-Catastrophes-Spark\"\
  >#2-03: Catastrophe’s Spark</a>. Her work has also been published by Rusted Iron\
  \ Games, Wayfinder, Eyes Unclouded (a really neat setting based on Studio Ghibli’\
  s works), and A Crystal Heart. On working with a few months ago on Starfinder Society\
  \ <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq026hp?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-315-Frozen-Ambitions-The-Preluria-Connection\"\
  >#3-15: Frozen Ambitions: The Preluria Connection</a>, Starfinder Society Developer\
  \ Jenny Jarzabski says, “I feel confident saying that she’s a rising star you should\
  \ keep your eye on! Whether she’s writing adventures, roleplaying vesk in tiaras,\
  \ or telling us all about weird animals, Tineke brings joy and laughter to our community.\
  \ We’re lucky to have her!”<br> When asked, Tineke noted she is very proud of writing\
  \ the Marixah Republic and the Gideron Authority in SFS 1-24 and Near Space and\
  \ that she has written many favorite characters including the Chelaxian kids from\
  \ Trailblazer’s Bounty, Amkha from Catastrophe’s Spark, and Kanavu from Dreaming\
  \ of the Future. She also gave a honorable mention to Wilbert the Saint Bernard.</p>\
  \ \n      <br> \n      <h3>Linda Zayas-Palmer</h3> \n      <p>Linda participated\
  \ in the Pathfinder Society as a player, then GM, then volunteer coordinator several\
  \ years before she join the Paizo staff as a Pathfinder Society developer in spring\
  \ 2015. Over the past six years, she’s help shepherd the Society through an edition\
  \ change and several in-game world shattering events. As managing developer, she\
  \ worked closely with the Lost Omens team of Eleanor and Luis in creating the Lost\
  \ Omens: Pathfinder Society Guide. Linda is known for her love of leshys, creating\
  \ many of the creatures that appear in the Pathfinder RPG. Lesser known, but as\
  \ loved, is venture-captain Armeline Jirneau, a reform-minded-member of the Envoy’\
  s Alliance with a secret identity. First introduced in <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy9oij?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-806-Reaping-What-We-Sow\"\
  >PFS 8-06: Reaping What We Sow</a>, Armeline’s part of a new generation of venture-captains.\
  \ Readers can learn more about Armeline in the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq0250x?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Pathfinder-Society-Guide\"\

  \ \n      <p>Hilary Moon Murphy (aka Hmm) is a librarian, mom and a gamer chick.\
  \ She's passionate about building community, and so has spent a lot of time as an\
  \ Paizo Organized Play GM and volunteer. Writing for Paizo has been a ton of fun,\
  \ and she always loves when she sees players using something cool that she wrote\
  \ for either Starfinder or Pathfinder. Instead of talking more about herself in\
  \ the third person though, she'd like to address all the other women who may be\
  \ reading this blog and asking themselves the question: \"Could I become a freelancer\
  \ too?\" So, here's the straight answer: if you're a female gamer, chances are you\
  \ already know a lot about working hard, being creative and finding time for what's\
  \ important. If you want to write, go for it! Submit to Wayfinder. Write for 3PP\
  \ products. Get business cards. Contact Paizo developers at conventions and say,\
  \ \"I want to write for you\" and hand them your business card. Do it and be awesome!</p>\
  \ \n      <br> \n      <h3>Sara Marie</h3> \n      <p>While many of the women in\
  \ this blog are from our editorial department, Sara Marie comes from the operations\
  \ side of Paizo. Sara Marie started at Paizo over ten years ago, working her way\
  \ up through the ranks of Customer Service to her current position of manager of\
  \ the Customer Service and Community departments. This is a huge amount of effort,\
  \ as not only does she lead one of the most public facing teams, but she also moderates\
  \ the forums and is a staunch advocate of our play-by-post community. If you’ve\
  \ ever travelled to PaizoCon or Gen Con, you most likely encountered her expertly\
  \ directing activities in the registration queue or store. When she isn’t busy keeping\
  \ the wheels turning, she loves crafts and exploring the beautiful outdoor landscape\
  \ of the Pacific Northwest. Sara has also been learning about the interactions between\
  \ businesses and local government, and how the community of tabletop roleplaying\
  \ games here in Washington can continue to grow and thrive.</p> \n      <br> \n\
  \      <h3>Jessica Redekop</h3> \n      <p>My name is Jessica Redekop and I'm a\
  \ woman in tabletop gaming. I contributed to the recent <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq026k5?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Ancestry-Guide\"\
  >Pathfinder Lost Omens: Ancestry Guide</a> and the upcoming <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq027mn?Pathfinder-Bestiary-3\"\
  >Bestiary 3</a> and <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq027jf?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-216-Freedom-for-Wishes\"\
  >PFS #2-16 Freedom for Wishes</a>. I was also a contributor to Lost Spheres Publishing's\
  \ City of 7 Seraphs, and I play Xiadani on Know Direction's Valiant, an actual play\
  \ podcast. I'm on twitter and Instagram as @tectonomancer.<br> I love RPGs and I\
  \ am grateful to every person I've known on my journey into this industry, to the\
  \ people I've played games with and to those who gave me a chance as a writer, who\
  \ welcomed me into this hobby and made me feel like I belonged. I know how often\
  \ women and enbies are turned away from gaming, heard the horror stories about convention\
  \ experiences, and have had some of those horror story experiences myself. It's\
  \ easy to imagine how differently I'd feel about RPGs with that kind of introduction\
  \ to them. I'm grateful that didn't happen to me. </p> \n      <br> \n      <h3>Tonya\
  \ Woldridge</h3> \n      <p>Hello nufriends! My Paizo-adjacent journey started as\
  \ a volunteer in England. I was venture officer of several places before joining\
  \ the Paizo team as the Organized Play Coordinator in 2015. Though I joined a publishing\
  \ company, I never thought of writing as a creative outlet. My goals focused on\
  \ growing the organized play program, partly through making play spaces more inclusive\
  \ so that everyone would want to participate. A couple years in, I wanted to understand\
  \ more about the publishing side of our business. I mentioned this to Linda. She\
  \ helped me secure an assignment and mentored me through the whole process. This\
  \ help gave me the confidence to ask for another assignment, which led to me writing\
  \ for <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq0250x?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Pathfinder-Society-Guide\"\
  >Pathfinder Lost Omens: Pathfinder Society Guide</a>. While I’m not seeking a writing\
  \ career, being part of the production of a book led to deeper insight and helps\
  \ me be a more effective manager of the Organized Play program. <br> Between organized\
  \ play and freelancing, I’ve met a host of fantastic people I love spending time\
  \ with! To anyone thinking they want to join gaming communities, please do, we can’\
  t wait to meet you! You can find me on Facebook (PaizoOrgPlay), Twitter (@PaizoOPM)\
  \ and Discord (TonyaOPM#6396). I look forward to saying hi!</p> \n      <br> <a\

  \     <h3>Ivis Flanagan</h3> \n      <p>Hi, I’m Ivis – one of Paizo’s newer freelancers,\
  \ and OPF Venture Officer. <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq027mu?Pathfinder-Bounty-8-The-Tireless-Path\"\
  >Bounty 8: The Tireless Path</a> comes out at the end of this month. I also wrote\
  \ part of quest pack <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq0251a?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-311-Into-the-Veskarium\"\
  >SFS 3-11 Into the Veskarium</a>, was released late last year, which was written\
  \ and developed by a group that was all women or non-binary!<br> Marian Wright Edleman\
  \ once said “you can’t be what you can’t see,” and it is a thought that comes full\
  \ circle for me. I was taught as a kid that “girls can’t play RPGs” by the boys\
  \ who ran them, and since I never saw anyone other than that core crew doing so,\
  \ I took it to heart that they must be right. For years I stayed out of the tabletop\
  \ space, believing that it wasn’t a place that I belonged. Then I found Paizo’s\
  \ Organized Play, where for the first time I saw people that looked like me participating,\
  \ and I felt like I could take part. <br> In my time in this space, I have met some\
  \ incredible women. Many of them I have looked up to as mentors, and some I am even\
  \ lucky enough to call friends. They have all encouraged me to move forward, to\
  \ step into out and into my own, becoming confident in my abilities through the\
  \ process. I have come from being very shy player, to a competent gm, and now to\
  \ an author – getting to help build the worlds that I love for those that come after.\
  \ My greatest hope in all of this is to be seen by someone else and help them step\
  \ forward onto their own path. </p> \n      <br> \n      <h3>Devinne Caples</h3>\
  \ \n      <p>Devine joined us just over a year ago as our HR generalist. It was\
  \ just before we transitioned to work from home. She moved into the office next\
  \ to the Customer Service department. Sara Marie shared her experience of Devinne.\
  \ “Often in the mornings, we would be arriving at the same time for work and get\
  \ to catch up about work and life while I got a pot of coffee started for the day.\
  \ Devinne has been a source of inspiration and camaraderie over the past year, checking\
  \ in on me during some very rough spots, being a compassionate listener as I try\
  \ to navigate my career as a parent and a woman. Devinne provided insight, advice,\
  \ empathy, and so much knowledge. From my colleagues at here Paizo, I’ve heard so\
  \ many similarly positive things about how she has been able to help and support\
  \ them.”<br> Writing this out for this blog is bittersweet, as this March also marks\
  \ the end of Devinne’s time at Paizo, as she had an absolutely wonderful opportunity\
  \ come up elsewhere. Her new organization is lucky to have her, though she will\
  \ be sorely missed here at Paizo. Congratulations Devinne! </p> `\n      <p>These\
  \ are just a few of the absolute rock stars involved in producing the games you\
  \ love. If you get a chance, please let them know how much their contributions benefit\
  \ your hobby! </p> \n     </blockquote> \n    </div> <!-- tags: Paizo, Paizo Staff,\
