  ></a>\n     </div>\n     <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\">To truly\
  \ immerse oneself in the natural world, one must view it up close! Though our ultimate\
  \ goal was to find the Wardens of the Wild, we couldn’t neglect the incredible opportunities\
  \ for study we found over the course of our investigations, and we made frequent\
  \ stops to survey the wilds on foot (or on fin or wheel, in Lythea’s case). I hesitate\
  \ to call them “side expeditions,” for they were valuable in their own right; Chari’\
  s notes and sketches filled several folios we’re still disseminating now that we’\
  ve returned—ah, but I outpace myself.</p>\n      <p>In any case, these excursions\
  \ were where our scout, Telero, and our scribe, Charikleia, really had a chance\
  \ to shine. One day, early in our voyage together, we were flying along a river\
  \ that gradually carved the land into a breathtaking gorge, its cascading tributaries\
  \ branching like the roots of a great tree in the rocky canyons spread out below\
  \ us.</p>\n      <p>“Professor!” called Telero from the starboard rail, his voice\
  \ ringing bright and eager as always. “This could be the perfect place to look for\
  \ more sage aconite!”</p>\n      <p>(I feel I must pause to note, dear reader, lest\
  \ it cause confusion: I am not, in fact, a professor in any official capacity! A\
  \ lifelong scholar, certainly, and a dedicated librarian and archivist, but circumstances\
  \ led me away from my university studies long before I advanced to any sort of teaching\
  \ career. Nonetheless, I’ve been “the professor” to Telero since our first day aboard\
  \ the <em>Zoetrope</em>, and I must say I find the epithet endearing, despite its\
  \ inaccuracy.)</p>\n      <p>Telero grew up among talented herbalists and knew botany\
  \ was a special interest of both mine and the doctor’s; we also knew that where\
  \ interesting flora grew, interesting fauna was sure to follow. Who could say what\
  \ new discovery might lead us to the wardens? I set us down on the rocky riverbank—\
  my landings were getting smoother with practice—and called our small crew together\
  \ to prepare for the journey.</p>\n      <p>We quickly decided that, due to the\
  \ branching nature of the canyons, a group survey wasn’t the most efficient course\
  \ of action. “Let me go, Professor,” said Telero, eying the lodestone in his staff\
  \ and tying off a bearing. “I spotted a waterfall a few miles in when we flew over.\
  \ I can find it and then come back for everyone else!”</p>\n      <p>I could tell\
  \ asking him to wait for someone who hiked at my speed—that is to say, glacial—\
  would be futile. “A wonderful idea, Telero,” I said, smiling at his irrepressible\
  \ enthusiasm. “But it did look like there were several possible routes. Why don’\
  t you take Charikleia with you?” The two had already bonded over similarities in\
  \ their childhoods, and the young nomad hung on the more seasoned adventurer’s every\
  \ word when she shared tales of her exploits before our voyage. I also suspected\
  \ Chari’s measured and experienced approach would be a good balance to Telero’s\
  \ hastier decisions on the trail.</p>\n      <p>My friend and fellow scholar nodded,\
  \ already tucking her sketchbook into her bag. “I <em>am</em> quite familiar with\
  \ mazes,” Chari teased, “and I’d love to sketch the falls—”</p>\n      <p>“Last\
  \ one there’s an egg full of broodpiercers!” Telero’s hooves thundered down the\
  \ gangplank as he charged off into the gorge, no longer able to contain his zest\
  \ for adventure.</p>\n      <p>“Careful to boil those first!” Grefu warned after\
  \ him. Chari laughed and waved to the rest of us as the two set off, the clatter\
  \ of their hooves echoing off the mossy basalt walls of the gorge long after they\
  \ faded from view.</p>\n      <p>Dr. Pom and I had barely finished our second leisurely\
  \ cups of tea when Telero came galloping back. My concern over his haste and Chari’\
  s absence was quickly allayed by the exuberance on his face. “Professor, everyone,\
  \ we found it! You’ve got to see this!”</p>\n      <p>Our intrepid scout deftly\
  \ guided us through the canyon, at times splashing through the river itself as the\
  \ mossy rock walls closed in around us, only a line of blue sky visible far above.\
  \ “How did you find it so quickly, Telero?” I asked, marveling at his surety as\
  \ the canyon widened and the river diverged. He led us down the left-claw path,\
  \ stopping often so those of us on two legs could keep up.</p>\n      <p>“It’s easy,”\
  \ said our young guide, his eyes earnest. “You just have to listen to the river\
  \ and watch the wind.”</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"\

  \ poetic insight has not yet improved my own sense of direction, but perhaps it\
  \ will resonate with you, dear reader. If nothing else, the boy’s words remind us\
  \ of the importance of being alert and appreciative of the world around us.</p>\n\
  \      <p>The roar of the falls drowned out further conversation as we rounded a\
  \ final bend and came to a large canyon pool, fed from the endless water cascading\
  \ over the cliff ahead. Telero beamed as we silently took in the thunderous serenade,\
  \ the mist covering our awed faces.</p>\n      <p>It was nearly a full minute before\
  \ I realized, with a shock, that Chari was sitting on a nearby rock, pencil in hand\
  \ as she sketched the scene in front of us for our logs. She looked up and smiled\
  \ as I took a seat next to her. Grefu and Dr. Pom began unpacking our picnic lunch\
  \ while Lythea, Telero, and Ten charged into the pool, their laughter barely audible\
  \ as they dove into the spray.</p>\n      <p>Chari passed me several sketches. “\
  Signs of stony bat spit, similar to those of other gorgon subspecies detailed in\
  \ the Kirisiel report, but I thought I’d document the flora first and wait for you\
  \ to investigate.”</p>\n      <p>I paged through her neat drawings, all precisely\
  \ labeled in her steady hand. “These are wonderful, Charikleia. How lucky we are\
  \ to have you along. How was the trek?”</p>\n      <p>She laughed. “Telero’s a natural.\
  \ He’d be right at home in the training mazes back home. I’d love to see him race\
  \ my siblings sometime.”</p>\n      <p>Though I can’t fathom how he could have heard\
  \ us over the waterfall, Telero bounded forward from the pool, narrowly avoiding\
  \ soaking Chari’s sketchbook. “Chari could have found it first!” he protested, shaking\
  \ water from his hair. “But she had to stop to draw everything.”</p>\n      <p>I\
  \ traded a smile with my fellow researcher as she restacked her notes and moved\
  \ them away from the pool. “I’m glad you’re both so thorough in your own ways,”\
  \ I said. “The smallest detail could be the clue that leads us to the wardens.”\
  \ I sighed, equal parts grateful and wistful, the sun warm on my scales. “Now, if\
  \ only I were as organized as you are, Charikleia. I don’t suppose you know where\
  \ I placed volume three of <em>The Thrilling Tales of Spiridendra</em>, do you?”\
  </p>\n      <p>“You’re the librarian, Baranthet, not me,” she joked, standing and\
  \ offering me her hand. “Care to join us by the falls? I think I saw some likely\
  \ nesting spots in the rocks behind the water.”</p>\n      <p>Telero leapt forward.\
  \ “I saw that too! C’mon, Professor!”</p>\n      <p>I accepted Chari’s hand with\
  \ a smile as she helped me to my feet. “Lead the way!”</p>\n      <br>\n      <br\

  \       <hr width=\"75%\">\n      </center>\n      <br>\n      <p>Hi everyone—James\
  \ here! As we get closer to Howl of the Wild’s May release date, we thought we’\
  d share with you some logs of the wildlife expedition of the airship Zoetrope and\
  \ its crew of naturalists as they seek the mythical Wardens of the Wild, which Simone\
  \ has diligently sourced. As you may know, Howl of the Wild presents <a href=\"\
  \ https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sibw&amp;page=1?Meet-the-Crew-of-the-Zoetrope\
  \ \"> six new playable ancestries </a>, each of whom is represented by a different\
  \ member of the airship’s crew—alongside Baranthet, the expedition’s iruxi leader.</p>\n\
  \      <p>Since we got a look at Charikleia and Telero today, this seems like a\
  \ good time to show off feats for the centaur and minotaur ancestries coming in\
  \ the final book! Centaurs can be pretty competitive, and young Telero’s no exception:</p>\n\
  \      <p><u></u></p>\n      <h3><u>FIERCE COMPETITOR [one-action] — FEAT 9</u></h3>\n\
  \      <p></p>\n      <p><b>Centaur, Mental</b><br><u><b>Frequency</b> once per\
  \ day</u><br>\n        You challenge a single ally to a physical competition. This\
  \ competition must involve accomplishing a specific goal for a specific use of the\
  \ Acrobatics or Athletics skill, such as Climbing to the top of a wall, Tripping\
  \ a specific foe, or Long Jumping across a chasm. You and your selected ally gain\
  \ a +2 circumstance bonus to the associated skill check for 1 minute or until one\
  \ of you wins the challenge, whichever is first. If you win this competition, you\
  \ gain a +2 status bonus to Intimidation checks for 1 hour.</p>\n      <br>\n  \
  \    <p>You wouldn’t really expect someone as soft-spoken as Chari to be scary,\
  \ but it turns out minotaurs are frighteningly good at disappearing into mazes and\
  \ other cover.</p>\n      <p><u></u></p>\n      <h3><u>ALARMING DISAPPEARANCE —\
  \ FEAT 5</u></h3>\n      <p></p>\n      <p><b>Minotaur</b><br><u><b>Prerequisites</b>\
  \ expert in Stealth</u><br>\n        Your ability to move unseen is startling for\
  \ one your size, causing panic among your enemies. When you successfully Hide when\
  \ previously observed, creatures you are hidden from become frightened 1. They are\
  \ then temporarily immune to Alarming Disappearance for 1 hour.</p>\n      <div\
