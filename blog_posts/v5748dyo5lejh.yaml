  \ Tim Pratt</p> \n   <h2>Chapter Three: Rich Man's Crusade</h2> \n   <div itemprop=\"\
  articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">Rodrick threw the lantern\
  \ at the dwarf's head. It bounced off the miner's helmet, but didn't deter the attack.</span></p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Use me!\" Hrym shouted.</p> \n    <p>Rodrick lifted the sword defensively.\
  \ As he swung the blade, an arc of whiteness flew from its tip and struck the dwarf\
  \ just below the knees. The miner's forward movement instantly halted, and he swayed\
  \ like a young sapling, his boots and calves frozen to the tunnel floor—which didn't\
  \ stop him from swinging his axe wildly, to the limit of his reach.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  I'll just, ah, be going.\" Rodrick moved carefully around the dwarf, then followed\
  \ the slanting tunnel upward at a brisk jog. </p> \n    <p>What other miners they\
  \ encountered were quick to drop their swords and flee, and a short while later\
  \ Rodrick and Hrym emerged into a bustling mining camp. They sidled toward the edge\
  \ of the settlement and then hared off into the trees, following a ridgeline up\
  \ and away. Once they'd reached high-ish ground, Rodrick looked around in hopes\
  \ of finding his bearings. The barrow was in the hills of northern Andoran, east\
  \ of Darkmoon Vale, but he wasn't sure how far he'd gone underground. But if the\
  \ gloomy spire of Droskar's Crag was over there, then that was west, and so...</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Are you lost?\" Hrym said.</p> \n    <p>\"Only until I find a road,\"\
  \ Rodrick replied, and set off downhill in what he suspected to be the direction\
  \ most likely to lead to civilization. After a while they hooked up with a dirt\
  \ track—probably the one that led to the mining camp—and Rodrick proceeded with\
  \ more confidence. They were sure to encounter a village soon, or someone they could\
  \ beg a ride from.</p> \n    <p>\"So what are you really?\" Hrym said as they—or,\
  \ rather, Rodrick—trudged along.</p> \n    <p>\"I can't imagine what you mean.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"You say you're an adventurer. You're certainly no fighter, though—\
  when holding a sword in one hand and a lantern in the other, your first instinct\
  \ is to defend yourself with the lantern? I would therefore assume you're a thief,\
  \ but I saw you skulking in the cavern, and you're equally awful at stealth—\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Please, your flattery will overwhelm me. I do wish I had a scabbard\
  \ to shove you into.\" He switched Hrym to his left hand and stretched out the cramped\
  \ fingers of his right. Carrying a sword for this long was grueling, even if Hrym\
  \ was lighter than most blades his size. \"As you can see, I look like a fighter—\
  \"</p> \n    <p>\"Humans look mostly like fuzzy blobs of varying hues to me, I'm\
  \ afraid.\"</p> \n    <p>Rodrick sighed. \"Take me at my word, then—I am long of\
  \ limb, broad of shoulder, wide of chest, mighty of thew, and so on. Reasonably\
  \ mighty, anyway. I am blessed with a certain natural athleticism, though admittedly\
  \ devoid of skill or training in battle, because people get hurt in battles, and\
  \ I have no interest in getting hurt. But looking as I do makes it easy for me to\
  \ be hired as a caravan guard, or personal bodyguard, or member of an adventuring\
  \ party—\"</p> \n    <p>\"And once there, in the midst of your trusted allies, you\
  \ wait for the opportune moment to steal whatever you can and escape in the night?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Do I detect a note of judgment in your voice, sword?\"</p> \n  \

  ></a>\n     <br> Many nobles fancy themselves warriors, but most warriors would\
  \ rather be nobles.\n    </div> \n    <p>\"Not at all. I'm interested in ends, not\
  \ means. And I'm only interested in ends when those ends are gold.\"</p> \n    <p>Rodrick\
  \ laughed. \"You and I could get along, sword. A shame I've promised you to someone\
  \ else.\"</p> \n    <p>\"You could just steal me, though,\" Hrym said reasonably.\
  \ \"In fact, by not stealing me, you're violating your own habits. You might even\
  \ be accused of doing an honest day's labor.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Oh, I had to cheat\
  \ a few people to get into the barrow, don't worry—I kept in practice. And what\
  \ are you saying, anyway? You'd give up your spot in a rich man's treasure-heap?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"I'm not volunteering to join you, no, though this has been entertaining—\
  at least compared to being jammed beneath a linnorm's belly. I'm just wondering\
  \ why you don't seize an object of my obvious value. An intelligent sword of living\
  \ ice, capable of speech and great feats of magic—whatever this rich man's paying\
  \ you, I'm worth more in your hand.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Ah, and if I were truly a fighter\
  \ and adventurer, I'm sure I'd never dream of giving you up. But to succeed in my\
  \ chosen venture, I benefit from a certain amount of anonymity. I can easily disappear\
  \ into a crowd after committing a morally questionable act—assuming it's a sufficiently\
  \ handsome crowd—and alter my speech, mannerisms, and mode of dress well enough\
  \ to elude detection. But if I started carrying around a loud-mouthed sword with\
  \ a blade of shimmering blue-white crystal, word would get around. I might even,\
  \ allow me to shudder at the thought, become famous.\"</p> \n    <p>\"You might\
  \ have to change your ways a bit, I suppose,\" Hrym said.</p> \n    <p>\"You wouldn't\
  \ suggest I try actually being a fighter.\"</p> \n    <p>\"No, no. You'd just have\
  \ to get better at cheating people and stealing from them—ideally leaving them unaware\
  \ they'd been cheated at all, at least until you'd said your farewells and ridden\
  \ into the next country. I'd be good for you. I'd force you to become more cunning,\
  \ and elevate your practice.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Alas, we'll never know.\" Rodrick\
  \ shaded his eyes and looked down the ridge. \"Aha! I know that village. I can get\
  \ a sheath for you there, and a horse, and room for the night.\" He yawned. \"And\
  \ then take advantage of a bed. Being drugged in a barrow doesn't count as a good\
  \ night's sleep.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I don't like sheathes,\" Hrym said. \"And you'd\
  \ better not spend all the gold you stole on horses and beds and things—you'll need\
  \ to scatter a nice layer of coins for me to rest upon while you sleep.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"You are a very odd weapon, Hrym.\"</p> \n    <p align=\"center\">∗∗∗</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The sword drew quite a few glances before Rodrick bought a sheathe and\
  \ convinced Hrym it was better to be temporarily hidden than to become a target\
  \ for ambitious bandits. They settled in an inn Rodrick had visited before and bedded\
  \ down for the night. Normally when so flush with coin Rodrick would not have been\
  \ alone in that bed, but the thought of inviting one of the village's more adventurous\
  \ ladies up to his room while Hrym rested in a drawer on a thin scattering of coins\
  \ was too embarrassing to contemplate. Yet another good reason he and the sword\
  \ shouldn't travel together.</p> \n    <p>And yet, they stayed up into the night,\
  \ talking. In the dark, it wasn't so strange to chat with an intelligent sword;\
  \ they were just a couple of rogues swapping stories of past exploits. Rodrick's\
  \ tales were mostly wildly exaggerated, and he assumed Hrym's were, too. Even so,\
  \ the sword's laziness and avarice—and the heroic efforts he was willing to expend\
  \ in hopes of future laziness, while wielded by men far more ambitious than Hrym\
  \ himself—were truly inspiring.</p> \n    <p>The last thing Hrym said before Rodrick\
  \ fell asleep was, \"My great tragedy is that I'm so attractive to conquerors, crusaders,\
  \ and heroes, when by temperament I'd be a better companion for a treacherous, self-interested\
  \ hedonist like you.\"</p> \n    <p>\"You say the nicest things, sword,\" Rodrick\
  \ said, and closed his eyes.</p> \n    <p align=\"center\">∗∗∗</p> \n    <p>The\
  \ next day Rodrick bought a sweet-tempered horse and they rode down out of the hills\
  \ east of Darkmoon Vale, toward the fertile valleys south of the Andoshen River,\
  \ where Rodrick's employer Manius lived. The rich man's family had been nobility\
  \ back in the days when Andoran had such things, and in the years since had managed\
  \ to recreate the conditions of nobility by buying up farm- and timberland, amassing\
  \ quite a fortune. He lived in a grand house surrounded by green fields, with a\
  \ stand of personal forest spreading green and wild beyond—</p> \n    <p>Or at least\
  \ he had last time Rodrick was here. Rodrick reined in his horse and stood staring\
  \ across the fields. </p> \n    <p>\"What?\" Hrym said, voice muffled inside the\
  \ scabbard. \"Are we there yet?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Ah, nearly,\" Rodrick said.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The fields were trampled and full of tents, with armored men milling\
  \ among them. The miniature forest was greatly reduced, and the sounds of hammering\
  \ and sawing and cart-building suggested what had become of those noble old trees.\
  \ Smoke rose from the house's four chimneys, and from at least two makeshift forges.\
  \ Rodrick, never comfortable entering camps of armed men without a good reason,\
  \ eased his horse forward. None of the soldiers challenged him, even as he passed\
  \ among the tents and proceeded to the house. A harried-looking man stood near the\
  \ front door, directing various servants, and Rodrick recognized him as Manius's\
  \ head of household. </p> \n    <p>\"Hail,\" Rodrick said. \"I've returned from\
  \ my mission—\"</p> \n    <p>The chamberlain—or whatever his title was—squinted\
  \ at Rodrick, then brightened. \"Ah! The master was just wondering if you ever intended\
  \ to return. We'll see to your horse—you go on inside. The butler will arrange an\
  \ audience.\"</p> \n    <p>\"If you don't mind me asking,\" Rodrick began, \"why\
  \ is there an army on the—\" But the man had already hurried away.</p> \n    <p>The\
  \ butler didn't open the door at Rodrick's knock, so the thief just let himself\
  \ in. The interior of the place had changed greatly, too—the beautiful rugs were\
  \ gone, leaving bare wood behind, and the artwork was gone from the walls. He wandered\
  \ on the first floor until he found the butler, who stuck him in a drawing room\
  \ that still possessed a couple of chairs and told him to wait. Hrym complained\
  \ of being in the sheath, so Rodrick drew him forth and leaned him against the other\
  \ chair. </p> \n    <p>\"This doesn't look like the opulent palace you led me to\
  \ expect,\" Hrym said suspiciously.</p> \n    <p>Rodrick spread his hands. \"It\
  \ was a rich man's mansion last time I was here, I assure you. I can't speak for\
  \ what's going on now—\"</p> \n    <p>\"What's going on,\" said Manius, stepping\
  \ in and shutting the door after him, \"is preparation for a crusade.\" Manius was\
  \ in his early fifties, with graying hair, a lined and serious face; and the bearing\
  \ of a warrior ascetic. He wore the sort of clothes that seemed ordinary unless\
  \ you noticed how perfectly they were cut and tailored to his form. His eyes fell\
  \ upon Hrym, and widened. \"Rodrick. You succeeded. You brought me the blade of\
  \ ice!\"</p> \n    <p>\"I did,\" Rodrick said. \"With great effort and considerable\
  \ peril, and even loss of life among the hirelings who assisted me, and—\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"You will be duly compensated.\" Manius stepped forward, then paused. \"\
  Does, ah—does it truly speak?\"</p> \n    <p>\"I do,\" Hrym said. \"You may address\
  \ me directly.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Remarkable!\" Manius said, still talking to Rodrick.\
  \ \"One of my ancestors saw this blade in battle, wielded by Brant Selmy—\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Oh, I hated him,\" Hrym said. \"Never knew how to relax. Until he died.\
  \ Buried me in his tomb with him. But I suppose you know that.\"</p> \n    <p>Manius\
  \ knelt, took Hrym by the hilt, and raised him up, staring at the shimmering blade.\
  \ Rodrick felt an unexpected twinge at seeing the sword in another man's hand. </p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Beautiful,\" Manius murmured. \"You will be the death of many a demon.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Demons?\" Hrym and Rodrick said at the same time.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Oh, yes,\" Manius said. \"It's the reason I wanted this sword. My life has been\
  \ one of idleness and pointless pleasure for far too long. I decided that I need\
  \ to make my mark on the world before I die. And so I've spent every penny I've\
  \ inherited and earned to gather and provision an army of crusaders to go north,\
  \ where we will face the demon-infested nightmare land men call the Worldwound.\"\
  \ He held up Hrym. \"We leave in one week. And with this sword, I hope to slay a\
  \ demon lord with my own hand.\"</p> \n    <p><b>Coming Next Week:</b> The final\
