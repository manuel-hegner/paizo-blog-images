  \ \n   <h2>Chapter Four: In the Lair of the White Leech</h2> \n   <p>\"Which one's\
  \ the Gullet want?\"</p> \n   <p>\"Don't think he cares, long as it ain't one of\
  \ the new ones. Someone been in there at least a few days.\"</p> \n   <p>The two\
  \ warriors—muscle-bound, covered in scars of both battle and pestilence—waded into\
  \ the waters, making for the stump from which the pulley could be operated.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"What about that gussied-up Shackles pirate we took? He oughta be about\
  \ ripe by now, yeah?\"</p> \n   <p>\"Yeah, what is he? Two down, four over?\" The\
  \ White Leech reached for the mildewed rope, tugged—and nothing happened. A puzzled\
  \ glance upward, and he could just barely make out an amorphous shape in the darkness,\
  \ perched on the block-and-tackle.</p> \n   <p>\"Hey, what—!\"</p> \n   <p>The blood-smeared\
  \ tooth wasn't much of a weapon, and her left hand was all but useless. But when\
  \ Ameyanda dropped upon the first of her captors, a feral snarl erupting through\
  \ bared teeth, it made no difference.</p> \n   <p></p>\n   <center>\n    ∗∗∗\n \
  \  </center>\n   <p></p> \n   <p>\"Issisk...\" Somehow, though the iron stakes allowed\
  \ little range of movement, Seyusth seemed to slump. \"You must understand—\"</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"Understand? Understand that you murdered your own cohort on your journey\
  \ to the Terwa? That you snuck back to Haa-Ok and killed Errash, your own mentor,\
  \ before skulking home with your tales of ambush? You never knew Hasseth survived,\
  \ did you?\"</p> \n   <p>\"I—\"</p> \n   <p>\"He ran, Seyusth. The greatest warrior\
  \ of Haa-ok, and he fled. He thought that, because it was you who tried to kill\
  \ him, it must have been the will of the shaman. It was not until I spoke to him,\
  \ in his dying days, and told him that Errash had also been murdered, and the lies\
  \ you spun of what had occurred, that he knew it was you alone who had betrayed\
  \ him. Betrayed us!\"</p> \n   <p>\"Issisk, <i>listen</i>! Errash wanted the alliance\
  \ for his own gain, not because the spirits told him so. The others, you... None\
  \ of you understand what the Terwa Lords are! What we would become, were we to ally\
  \ with them... The horrors we would have to accept, to inflict... I died with every\
  \ Haa-Ok life I took, but I <i>could not</i> allow the delegation to deliver us\
  \ into a devil's bargain for the soul of our people!\"</p> \n   <p>\"I do not know\
  \ the Terwa Lords,\" Issisk said stiffly. \"I know only what you told me of them.\
  \ How can I know, now, what of that is true?\"</p> \n   <p>\"All of it. Issisk,\
  \ I swear—\"</p> \n   <p>\"What I know is that the blood of several Haa-Ok is on\
  \ your talons. And that this was not your decision to make.</p> \n   <p>\"Some day,\
  \ Seyusth, the eyes of the White Leech will grow careless, and I will escape. Perhaps\
  \ tomorrow, perhaps a year from now. But I will make my way home, and I will tell\
  \ all Haa-Ok what you did. That it was not the wrath of the spirits that allowed\
  \ an assassin to reach our shaman, but a traitor who knew his magics. And they will\
  \ make their <i>own</i> choice, as they should have long ago.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Issisk,\
  \ <i>please</i>!\" It was not a word that came easily to the lizardfolk, above all\
  \ a practical and pragmatic people. \"Please, if your anger is with me, take it\
  \ out on me. But you will be doing Haa-Ok only harm if you—\"</p> \n   <p>\"You\
  \ have no more words I wish to hear, traitor.\"</p> \n   <p>Seyusth was still pleading\
  \ as his cousin disappeared through the open doorway, followed by the shambling\
  \ Hasseth. If his people were capable of it, he would have wept.</p> \n   <p>It\
  \ was the commotion from outside—running, howling, the thump of fists on armor as\
  \ wild men worked themselves into a frenzy—that snapped him out of it a few moments\
  \ later. From here, he could see absolutely nothing of what was happening. All he\
  \ could tell was that it wasn't a fire.</p> \n   <p>Which, given the rather damp\
  \ state of affairs, he'd have known anyway.</p> \n   <p>The sounds faded into the\
  \ distance, the night now filled with nothing but the hum of insects and the hoot\
  \ of a hunting bird. And then...</p> \n   <p>\"Hsst! Seyusth!\"</p> \n   <div class=\"\

  \    <br> \"Issisk knows things he shouldn't.\"\n   </div> \n   <p>Ameyanda slipped\
  \ in through the doorway, carrying one of the White Leech blades. The human looked\
  \ <i>awful</i>—her eyes were slightly wild, she winced with every step—but it seemed\
  \ that most of the blood splattered across her armor and skin was not hers.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"We don't have long,\" she told him, limping across the open chamber.\
  \ \"I left a trail down to the water's edge, and pushed one of the small rafts into\
  \ the current. Not one with the dead who, uh, row,\" she clarified. \"But we have\
  \ only minutes before they catch up and realize I'm not aboard.\"</p> \n   <p>\"\
  Then we had better act, and discuss the details of your miraculous escape another\
  \ day.\"</p> \n   <p>She nodded and halted before him, examining the rough wooden\
  \ cross.</p> \n   <p>\"Seyusth,\" she said softly, \"there's no way to do this gently,\
  \ not in the time we have.\"</p> \n   <p>\"I understand.\" He squeezed his eyes\
  \ shut. \"Do it.\"</p> \n   <p>Even in the blackness, the room spun as she pulled\
  \ the cross from the corner, twisted it clumsily, and laid it flat. He felt her\
  \ fingers squeeze between his scales and the curved iron pinning his right arm;\
  \ saw her flinch from the touch of the necromantic runes; heard the scrape as she\
  \ braced her feet on the wood.</p> \n   <p>Wood splintered. Iron screeched. And\
  \ despite his most adamant efforts, Seyusth screamed.</p> \n   <p></p>\n   <center>\n\
  \    ∗∗∗\n   </center>\n   <p></p> \n   <p>When it was done, they lay sprawled on\
  \ the floor, chests heaving, growing sticky with the lizardman's blood. Ameyanda\
  \ tried not to stare at the raw meat and exposed tendon visible through the rents\
  \ in her companion's flesh.</p> \n   <p>Especially when they began to twitch.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"They still work well enough...\" he muttered. His arm shaking, he reached\
  \ a hand out to the huntress's shoulder.</p> \n   <p>\"Seyusth...\"</p> \n   <p>But\
  \ he was already speaking in his own reptilian tongue.</p> \n   <p>Ameyanda gasped\
  \ as an icy shock ran down her arm, as though someone had replaced her blood with\
  \ mountain runoff. It faded swiftly, however, and so too did much of the agony in\
  \ her hand.</p> \n   <p>Not all—and it still burned with a sickly heat—but any relief\
  \ was welcome.</p> \n   <p>\"Tomorrow,\" the shaman said softly, \"I can cure the\
  \ infection. I fear you will have to bear it until then.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Thank you.\
  \ I—\"</p> \n   <p>Again he spoke in his own language, and the worst of his wounds\
  \ began to close over. Much like her own, it was far from a complete cure, but impressive\
  \ for all that.</p> \n   <p>\"What of Issisk?\" she asked, staggering roughly to\
  \ her feet.</p> \n   <p>Seyusth's face went tight, as though he'd only just remembered\
  \ why they'd come.</p> \n   <p>\"He is here. He... ran into the swamp when the commotion\
  \ began. I must find him before they do.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Wait just a—\"</p> \n \
  \  <p>The shaman staggered through the door, shifting into some sort of ibis, and\
  \ took to the night skies.</p> \n   <p>\"Grandfather Gozreh <i>damn</i> that lizard!\
  \ I should—\"</p> \n   <p>The thump-squelch of ponderous footsteps in the mud, and\
  \ a high-pitched wheezing of animal fury, announced that her time had run out.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>They announced, too, who approached.</p> \n   <p>The room was empty, save\
  \ for the broken cross. Nowhere to hide. And even after Seyusth's curative magics,\
  \ Ameyanda didn't think she had it in her to face the Gullet directly.</p> \n  \
  \ <p>Her frantic gaze alighted upon the shaman's blood, only just beginning to seep\
  \ into the saturated wooden floor. With no other choice, she dropped to her knees\
  \ and began to arrange things just so...</p> \n   <p>A grunt as he came through\
  \ the door, a faint creak of wood beneath his feet. She knew what the walking avalanche\
  \ of flesh must see: Her body, lying crumpled in the midst of a sizable blood pool,\
  \ her stolen weapon lying beside her. Using techniques she'd learned long ago to\
  \ avoid the sensitive ears of prey and predator both, she breathed lightly, softly.\
  \ In the feeble lighting, it should appear she didn't breathe at all.</p> \n   <p>She\
  \ hoped.</p> \n   <p>\"Well, haven't you been trouble?\" the high, breathy voice\
  \ asked from behind. \"Not as ripe as I'd like, but you'll still taste fine. And\
  \ more of you to go around, with fewer mouths to feed.\"</p> \n   <p>She felt flabby\
  \ fingers close around an ankle, lift in preparation to drag her from the room...</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Ameyanda rolled upright, stomach muscles screaming, and struck. The iron\
  \ spike that had nailed Seyusth's feet to the cross now plunged through Galgur's\
  \ own. The lumbering giant shrieked, a sound almost too high to hear, and crumpled,\
  \ grasping reflexively at the sudden agony.</p> \n   <p>The huntress's other hand,\
  \ clutching one of the sharpened brackets that had held the shaman's arms, punched\
  \ between those toothy ridges and down that screaming gullet. She felt things tear\
  \ around her makeshift weapon, the skin of his throat quivering obscenely at the\
  \ touch of the thing's vile magics.</p> \n   <p>\"How does <i>that</i> taste, you\
  \ motherless hyena?\"</p> \n   <p>Galgur managed a single, wet choke. Blood bubbled\
  \ up around Ameyanda's hand, and she yanked it back, leaving the cursed bracket\
  \ behind.</p> \n   <p>The room shook as the Gullet's body rolled to the floor. Ameyanda\
  \ decided to believe that her brief gasp was a result of that shuddering, and not\
  \ a near-sob of relief at the creature's death.</p> \n   <p><i>All right, now what?</i></p>\
  \ \n   <p>She had no idea of how quickly the others would return, and she'd never\
  \ find her way out of here wounded, in the dark, without Seyusth. So what could\
  \ she possibly...</p> \n   <p>Ameyanda studied the massive corpse, then the blade\
  \ on the floor beside the puddle of blood, and heaved a thick sigh. <i>In a day\
  \ of sickening tasks, what's one more?</i></p> \n   <p>At least now she had somewhere\
  \ to hide...</p> \n   <p></p>\n   <center>\n    ∗∗∗\n   </center>\n   <p></p> \n\
  \   <p>\"I knew you would run.\"</p> \n   <p>Seyusth dropped through the branches,\
  \ shifting out of bird-form as he landed with a muddy thump. \"After what you told\
  \ me, I knew you would see the sudden commotion as your opportunity. Perhaps even\
  \ a gift from the spirits.\"</p> \n   <p>Issisk straightened, hand hovering near\
  \ the blade at his belt. \"What do you intend?\"</p> \n   <p>\"Issisk, please. I\
  \ will help you get home, and submit myself to whatever penance you see fit, but\
  \ do not tell the others! Their belief may be all that keeps us from the Terwa!\"\
  </p> \n   <p>\"I am not you, Seyusth. I will not deceive our people. I will let\
  \ them make their own choice. And where Hasseth and the others were tribesmates,\
  \ I am <i>family</i>. I do not believe you would murder me to keep your secret.\"\
  </p> \n   <p>Seyusth lowered his gaze, and Issisk turned to walk away.</p> \n  \
  \ <p></p>\n   <center>\n    ∗∗∗\n   </center>\n   <p></p> \n   <p>For several days\
  \ they traveled. They rested as well as they could, in the best shelters they could\
  \ find, and said little. Finally, they awoke one morning to the welcome sight of\
  \ the Mwangi jungles against the eastern horizon.</p> \n   <p>Ameyanda rose, stretched,\
  \ preparing herself for another day's hike. She eyed the rough blade she carried\
  \ with distaste and more than a little sadness. Those mambeles had been her trusted\
  \ companions for years. She could acquire new ones readily enough, but it wouldn't\
  \ be the same.</p> \n   <p>Seyusth appeared beside her, also ready for travel—and\
  \ apparently still digesting what she'd told him over breakfast.</p> \n   <p>\"\
  You really hid <i>inside</i>—\"</p> \n   <p>She shuddered with the memory of the\
  \ charnel stench, the wet coils looping around her arms, the hot, reeking fat closing\
  \ in around her. \"It worked. And I don't want to talk about it.\"</p> \n   <p>\"\
  I understand.\"</p> \n   <p>\"And Issisk?\" She hadn't planned to ask; the fact\
  \ that Seyusth had returned alone was evidence enough of the lizardman's fate. The\
  \ question just burst out in response to the unwanted imagery he'd inflicted on\
  \ her with his own comment, however unintended.</p> \n   <p>\"The White Leech reached\
  \ him before I did,\" Seyusth's attention fixed on the distant jungle. \"I was unable\
  \ to save him.\"</p> \n   <p>\"So this was all for nothing.\"</p> \n   <p>\"I...\
  \ fear so.\"</p> \n   <p>Ameyanda growled and started walking—then stopped once\
  \ more when she realized the lizardman was still behind her.</p> \n   <p>\"Isn't\
  \ this about where you turn north, if you're returning to Haa-Ok?\"</p> \n   <p>\"\
  I am not returning yet. I owe you—\"</p> \n   <p>\"No, we're even. I was repaying\
  \ a debt.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Yes, you accompanied me as repayment. But then you saved\
  \ me, when it would have been wiser to make your own escape from the White Leech.\"\
  </p> \n   <p>\"I'm not keeping count. And I have my own tasks, Seyusth.\"</p> \n\
  \   <p>\"And I will assist you.\"</p> \n   <p>\"You owe me nothing, shaman. Go home.\"\
  </p> \n   <p>The huntress began to walk once more, and this time she did not look\
  \ back.</p> \n   <p></p>\n   <center>\n    ∗∗∗\n   </center>\n   <p></p> \n   <p>\"\
  <i>Go home</i>.\"</p> \n   <p>It sounded nice enough. But Seyusth wasn't certain\
  \ he <i>had</i> a home any longer. The visage of every relative would be Issisk's\
  \ dying face; every glance, his eyes; every raised voice, an accusation.</p> \n\
  \   <p>Issisk had been right. He'd felt guilt before, but not until it was one of\
  \ his own family had he felt like a <i>traitor</i>.</p> \n   <p>Seyusth had meant\
  \ to save Issisk, he truly had. But the tribe must be protected. Haa-Ok was safe.\
  \ The people still believed the spirits disapproved of the Terwa Lords. They were\
  \ in no danger of losing their identity, their culture, their souls to those monsters.\
  \ And Seyusth's own apprentice could serve their spiritual and mystical needs for\
  \ many moons to come.</p> \n   <p><i>I can do more good here. Allies among the humans\
  \ will prove useful, someday, when the Terwa do come to Mwangi.</i></p> \n   <p>So\
  \ he told himself again, and again, in the hopes that he would start believe. Because\
  \ responsibility was easier to bear than guilt.</p> \n   <p>Seyusth sighed a very\
  \ human sigh, and set off after his distant companion.</p> \n   <p><b>Coming Next\
