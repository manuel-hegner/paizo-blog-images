  \ itemprop=\"description\">I've always loved comics. From the moment I learned how\
  \ to read as a child, I would often dedicate whole days over summer break to reading\
  \ the entire catalogue of strips like Calvin &amp; Hobbes, FoxTrot, or Bloom County.\
  \ For a while I dabbled in superhero comics, but it wasn't until a friend showed\
  \ me Sandman after college that a new world opened up and I began devouring graphic\
  \ novels. Around the same time someone introduced me to webcomics as well, and I\
  \ discovered yet another passion (one that eventually ended up with me being involved\
  \ in the infamous Machine of Death, alongside some of the giants of that field).\
  \ To this day, Paizo Editor-in-Chief Wes Schneider and I have a tradition of buying\
  \ each other comics we think the other should read (or more often, that we want\
  \ to read ourselves), and Publisher Erik Mona frequently unbars the door to his\
  \ comic vault to educate us youngsters what clearly don't know nothin' yet. (\"\
  Grant Morrison? Who's that?\")</span></p> \n    <p>Yet as much as I adore comics,\
  \ not since high school days spent tracing friends' sketches during class (yes,\
  \ I was one of those weirdos who wanted to be an inker) had I ever considered the\
  \ possibility of someday being <i>involved</i> in comics. That whole industry was\
  \ forever a mystery to me.</p> \n    <p>That curtain began to pull back, however,\
  \ when we partnered with Dynamite Entertainment to do the <a href=\"/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics\"\
  >Pathfinder comic</a>. Suddenly, I was getting to edit real, honest-to-god comic\
  \ scripts, see how words become sketches and then finals, and meet some of the awesome\
  \ creators and editors who make it happen. Talking with the people involved, I started\
  \ to see how things worked. And I knew, without doubt, that if given the chance,\
  \ I would be <i>all over that</i>.</p> \n    <p>Fortunately for me, that chance\
  \ came with the announcement of the Pathfinder Goblins! miniseries. Erik and Dynamite\
  \ were kind enough to give some of us at Paizo the chance to pitch story ideas,\
  \ and as luck would have it, Wes, Erik, and I all found ourselves added to the writer\
  \ lineup alongside comic heavy-hitters like Adam Warren, Charles Soule, Ray Fawkes,\
  \ and more. </p> \n    <p>I was there. I was <i>writing part of a comic book</i>.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Now I just needed to learn how to write a comic book.</p> \n    <p>Fortunately,\
  \ I knew just where to turn. If you didn't already know, in addition to writing\
  \ the main Pathfinder comic, Jim Zubkavich also does Skullkickers, one of the funniest\
  \ and most creative fantasy comics around, as well as a wide variety of other work.\
  \ More importantly, he's also a really nice guy. So nice, in fact, that he's written\
  \ up a <a href=\"http://www.jimzub.com/\">whole series of tutorials</a> on how to\
  \ write comics professionally. With his tips and tricks guiding me, I sat down and\
  \ took my shot.</p> \n    <p>The resulting story, \"Magic Pig,\" has just released\
  \ in <a href=\"/products/btpy9156\"><i>Pathfinder Goblins! #2</i></a>, and I couldn't\
  \ be happier. At one level, it's a story about a pig. At a deeper level, however,\
  \ it's about a <i>magic</i> pig. And at another, deeper <i>deeper</i> level, it's\
  \ a story about the problems with giving goblins magic items. Getting to work with\
  \ artist Sean Izaakse to bring that story to life was a joy, and I can't tell you\
  \ what a thrill it was to open the sketch file for that first page and see Magic\
  \ Pig in all his ceremonial finery.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    \
