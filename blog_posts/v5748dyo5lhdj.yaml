  > \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">When I talk to people about the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame\"\
  >Pathfinder Adventure Card Game</a>, I am inevitably asked, \"Who is your favorite\
  \ character?\" For me, it's a bit like asking to choose my favorite child. As the\
  \ lead developer for the game, I spent a lot of time and attention on every character,\
  \ getting to know the good, bad, and awesome of each one. My honest answer is this:\
  \ \"My favorite character changes all the time. As I dive into each character, I\
  \ really get to know its ins and outs, and usually, it becomes my favorite, at least\
  \ for a little while.\"</p> \n    <p>That said, there's another answer that's both\
  \ deeper and a bit more to the point: Since I started playing RPGs a long time ago,\
  \ I've always especially enjoyed playing clerics, paladins, and monks—characters\
  \ with strongly held beliefs that guide their actions in both everyday and extraordinary\
  \ circumstances. In the PACG, that brings us to Seelah.</p> \n    <p>Pathfinder's\
  \ iconic paladin Seelah is <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5la39\">a bit of a badass</a>.\
  \ She first appeared in PACG in the <a href=\"/products/btpy8x6m\"><em>Rise of the\
  \ Runelords Character Add-On Deck</em></a> alongside Amiri, Lini, and Sajan. Seelah\
  \ has never topped the list of the most popular characters from Rise of the Runelords,\
  \ but I'll let you in on a little secret: she's the best character in the set.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6001-Seelah1.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6001-Seelah1_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6001-Seelah2.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6001-Seelah2_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n    </div> \n    <p>That's a controversial statement, so let me clarify.\
  \ She's not the best at smashing or blasting monsters. She's not the best at acquiring\
  \ boons, and she's not nearly as good at avoiding trouble or demolishing barriers\
  \ as some. What Seelah does better than the rest of her party in <em>Rise of the\
  \ Runelords</em> is <b>explore</b>. Her deck has a good mix of armor (in case something\
  \ bad should happen), weapons (for making \"good\" things happen to bad people),\
  \ and blessings (for helping herself and others). The first of her two powers gives\
  \ her a good shot at dealing with whatever problems or opportunities might arise,\
  \ while the second power lets her get through a location deck like nobody's business.\
  \ Modeled after the paladin's ability to detect evil at close range—as well as her\
  \ uncanny ability to have trouble find her, no matter how sleepy and bucolic the\
  \ local village might seem—this power helps Seelah get through a location with speed\
  \ and aplomb. In combination, these two powers let Seelah get to the good works\
  \ that need doing: finding the problem and taking it down. In other words, winning.\
  \ You're welcome.</p> \n    <p>With the upcoming release of the <a href=\"/products/btpy9a46\"\
  ><em>Wrath of the Righteous Base Set</em></a>, we had a chance to show a different\
  \ side of Seelah. Still every bit the badass, this take on Seelah is now less concerned\
  \ with finding the evil hidden in the haystack—after all, in <em>Wrath</em>, the\
  \ evil just isn't that hard to find. This Seelah is ready for war, able to take\
  \ advantage of a monster's particular weakness and prepared to avoid the worst of\
  \ a bane's initial onslaught. Given the assortment of nasty monsters in <em>Wrath\
  \ of the Righteous</em>, I promise that you'll have plenty of chances to use her\
  \ first power! Her second power extends her aura of divine grace out to include\
  \ her nearby allies; in <em>Wrath</em>, you'll never be sad to have Seelah at your\
  \ side. Finally, <em>Wrath</em> includes the new Corrupted trait, representing the\
  \ corruption of the Worldwound intruding into the world. As a beacon of honor, Seelah\
  \ will keep those tainted boons away from the world until they can be safely dealt\
  \ with—destroyed, or perhaps even redeemed.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ></a> \n    </div> \n    <p>Once you get a handle on Seelah's character powers,\
  \ you have a choice to make. Luckily, both of her role options are great! As an\
  \ Inheritor's Blade, Seelah focuses on the aspects of martial and military practices\
  \ that you might expect from a paladin of Iomedae in the Worldwound (and other,\
  \ more... <i>exotic</i> locales). She learns to use her armor to keep her party\
  \ safe, and she can heal herself or her allies when she displays Iomedae's blessing.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-Seelah3.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-Seelah3_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n    </div> \n    <p>On the other hand, as a Wardstone Sentry, Seelah is\
  \ even more expert on shrugging off and putting down demonic cults and monsters,\
  \ be they summoned monsters or demonic armies. She becomes so deft at dealing with\
  \ corrupted relics that they don't even slow her down. The potency of her aura increases,\
  \ along with her opportunities to use it to aid her allies.</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-Seelah4_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n    </div> \n    <p>Additionally, Seelah in <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/wrathOfTheRighteous\"\
  ><em>Wrath of the Righteous</em></a> has a large number of good options for her\
  \ mythic path, including champion, guardian, marshal, and hierophant. Plus, there's\
  \ that other thing I can't talk about yet. I can say this: when Paul tells you about\
  \ it later, you'll know what I was talking about!</p> \n    <p>Chad Brown<br> <i>Adventure\
