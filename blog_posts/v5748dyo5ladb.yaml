  \ Six</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Thursday, June 25, 2009</p> \n   <p><i>6. Many\
  \ GMs feel that </i>deus ex machina<i> is cheap, and simply refuse to ever use it.\
  \ Others feel it is okay if it is properly set up ahead of time. Do you ever use\
  \ </i>deus ex machina<i> as a storytelling device?</i></p> <b></b>\n   <p><b>Lisa\
  \ Stevens</b>: Yeah, but hopefully they didn't know it! (laughs) I think that's\
  \ the trick for something like that though, right? If you're playing the hand of\
  \ god, you need to make it feel like a natural part of the story. I think probably\
  \ every GM has been in this type of situation, unless you're maybe a proponent of\
  \ the chaos theory and really like everything to be off the cuff, which could be\
  \ fun, but yeah, I definitely have used it.</p> <b></b>\n   <p><b>F. Wesley Schneider</b>:\
  \ I don't like to use <i>deus ex machina</i> plots. Most players, I've found, don't\
  \ like to play the role of the damsel in distress, they like to play heroes. So\
  \ I usually create a way that gives them a chance to solve the crisis.</p> <b></b>\n\
  \   <p><b>James Jacobs</b>: Yes. If it's good enough for Shakespeare, it's good\
  \ enough for Pathfinder. (grin)</p> <b></b>\n   <p><b>Jason Bulmahn</b>: I think\
  \ this is a useful storytelling device that must be used sparingly. It sits in the\
  \ bag of GM tricks that a Game Master is allowed to pull out exactly once during\
  \ a campaign. I think it is especially useful early on by giving PCs a forewarning\
  \ of the kind of powerful enemies that are to come later on. For example, let's\
  \ say a red dragon attacks their town. Well, at 1st level they're not going to do\
  \ so well. But then you have the high-level wizard who's their friend show up and\
  \ drive away the red dragon but is himself killed, and you've just set up a powerful\
  \ enemy. It allows you to sort of play with a system that is restrictive by CR.\
  \ In that way it's a useful storytelling device, but again only sparingly.</p> \n\
  \   <p><b>Sean K Reynolds</b>: Never.</p> <b></b>\n   <p><b>Joshua J. Frost</b>:\
  \ Only if it's appropriate for a story, never for combat. If I'm doing my job as\
  \ a DM right, then the combat should already be fair enough.</p> <b></b>\n   <p><b>James\
  \ Sutter</b>: I think it depends on the situation. I think James Jacobs said it\
  \ best when he said avoid it when you can, but sometimes it can work well, especially\
  \ when you realize you've made a mistake. If you send your PCs against a horde of\
  \ werewolves and they don't have any silver weapons, have the townsguard come in\
  \ and save them, but then have the players owe the townsguard a favor, so they still\
  \ have to earn it. I'm totally stealing that from Jacobs, but I think that sums\
  \ it up rather nicely.</p> \n   <p><b>Chris Self</b>: I think it's necessary, but\
  \ try to keep those sorts of things behind the scenes if possible. There should\
  \ be a real reason for everything.</p> \n   <p><i>I think if done incorrectly, </i>deus\
  \ ex machina<i> can come off as patronizing.</i></p> \n   <p>Hank Woon <br>Editorial\
