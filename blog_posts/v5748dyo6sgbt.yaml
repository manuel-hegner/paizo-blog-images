  \ itemprop=\"description\">Welcome to the next installment in our series of blogs\
  \ about the future of Pathfinder Society in the <a href=\"/pathfinderplaytest\"\
  >second edition of Pathfinder</a>! Setting the course for Pathfinder Society in\
  \ second edition is lot of work, but it's an exciting time too. After all, we get\
  \ to pull together your feedback and ideas with the lessons we've learned to make\
  \ a better campaign. In addition to considering the suggestions we've often heard\
  \ over the years on the forums, in game stores, and at conventions, we launched\
  \ a <a href=\"/community/forums/organizedPlay/playtest\">series of sticky threads\
  \ on the forums</a> about specific topics. Now, we're revising our biggest topics,\
  \ starting with a <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo6sg9l?Future-of-Pathfinder-Society-Update\"\
  >blog</a> that Tonya and I wrote at the end of September on tiers, level gain, and\
  \ the structure of the <a href=\"/products/btpy84k4?Pathfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Guide\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild Guide</i></a>. Last week, John and Mike\
  \ wrote a <a href=\"/community/blog/tags/organizedPlay\">blog about boons and chronicle\
  \ sheets</a>. If you missed either of those, I recommend checking them out. This\
  \ week, we're tackling pregenerated characters.</p> \n    <p>Pregenerated characters\
  \ (aka \"pregens\") wear quite a few hats in the Pathfinder Society campaign: they\
  \ serve as the first characters for many new players, let people jump into games\
  \ when they don't have a character of their own, and give people the chance to try\
  \ out new character classes. Over the years, we've received a lot of feedback on\
  \ the design of our pregenerated characters for Pathfinder Society. Those ideas\
  \ shaped the design of the <a href=\"/pathfinderplaytest#downloads\">pregenerated\
  \ characters</a> for the Pathfinder Playtest.</p> \n    <p>Now that folks have had\
  \ a chance to try out the new pregens, we'd like to hear from you about your experiences\
  \ with them. Are they easy to understand? Are they effective? Are they fun to play?\
  \ Do you have suggestions for improvement? To that end, we have a new pregenerated\
  \ character survey, linked at the bottom of the blog.</p> \n    <p>The survey's\
  \ last page is about the layout and organization of pregenerated characters. For\
  \ that, we have 5 proposals, linked below. We chose 5th-level Seoni for these comparisons,\
  \ not only because spellcasters have an extra section on their character sheets\
  \ that any design will need to accommodate, but also because a higher-level character\
  \ requires more space for rules. You can view all of the designs below:</p> \n \
  \   <blockquote> \n     <p><a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/y1z37wt1116x44l/Proposal%20A%20%28Portrait%29.pdf?dl=0\"\
  ><b>Prop</b><b>osal A (Portrait)</b></a><b>:</b> This is a vertically aligned pregenerated\
  \ character. It is similar to the pregenerated character released at the beginning\
  \ of August. The largest change is that more information has been moved to the first\
  \ pageâ€”most notably, Seoni's spells and equipment.</p> \n     <p><a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/j1p403b7clly9uo/Proposal%20B%20%28Landscape%29.pdf?dl=0\"\
  ><b>Proposal B (Landscape)</b></a>: This is a horizontally aligned version of Proposal\
  \ A. It has less open space, but the art fits more naturally on the page.</p> \n\
  \     <p><b><a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/gf1oox9be07dajg/Proposal%20C%20%28Chronicle%20Sheet%29.pdf?dl=0\"\
  >Proposal C (Character Sheet)</a>:</b> Some people have suggested that pregenerated\
  \ characters use exactly the same character sheets as players will be using for\
  \ their own characters. This version includes a scan of hand-filled copy of the\
  \ latest Chronicle sheet to give a general sense of what that might look like, followed\
  \ by the reference sheets from the landscape layout.</p> \n     <p><b><a href=\"\
  https://www.dropbox.com/s/8y3fi8qbzgldoat/Proposal%20D%20%28Original%20Playtest%29.pdf?dl=0\"\
  >Proposal D (Original Playtest)</a>:</b> This is the Playtest pregenerated character\
  \ for Seoni that we released in the beginning of August.</p> \n     <p><b><a href=\"\
  https://www.dropbox.com/s/3fgtrwxxaoovpi3/Proposal%20E%20%28First%20Edition%20Style%29.pdf?dl=0\"\
  >Proposal E (First Edition Style)</a>:</b> This is the 4th-level pregenerated Seoni\
  \ from the first edition of Pathfinder. We're including it as a baseline to see\
  \ how well the new designs are improving on what we used before.</p> \n    </blockquote>\
  \ \n    <p>I'd like to give a big shout out to Emily Crowell on the art team, who\
  \ has done all of the layout work for the pregens for the Pathfinder Playtest, as\
  \ well over 100 pregens for current version of Pathfinder Society. She does the\
  \ vast majority of layout and art design for Pathfinder Society as a whole, and\
  \ she's really awesome to work with. Thanks, Emily!</p> \n    <p>Finally, I want\
  \ to talk a bit about surveys as a whole. This is now the third blog to ask for\
  \ your feedback in surveys. This is because we are starting with the most important\
  \ pieces of the campaign, the ones that we are planning to lock in place by the\
  \ end of the year. With that in mind, giving us your results by <b>November 30th</b>\
  \ will give you the best chance of having your voice heard as we push forward. While\
  \ there may be more survey blogs in the future about critical topics (such as when\
  \ we revisit the topic of factions), we do not plan to establish an ongoing model\
  \ where we are asking you to fill in detailed surveys every week.</p> \n    <p><b><a\
