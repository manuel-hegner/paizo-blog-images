  \ \n     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Yoon’s target lay broken\
  \ in the soot in front of her. She felt the air enter her lungs, but she didn’t\
  \ pay it any heed, only the energy it held. The breath circulated through the young\
  \ kineticist’s veins, coursing through her organs and flickering with the faintest\
  \ traces of elemental power as it passed through each—at least, until it reached\
  \ her heart and the gate within it. The energy ignited within Yoon, blazing as her\
  \ body briefly became one with the Plane of Fire itself. Yoon’s eyes danced with\
  \ embers as she set them on her target, thrusting her fist forward in a practiced\
  \ stance and letting her breath out with a shout.</p> \n      <p>The log was no\
  \ match, and it burst into flames.</p> \n      <p>“Do it again! Do it again!” Behind\
  \ Yoon, the twins jumped up and down. Yoon smiled. The girls were growing up, and\
  \ though they weren't quite as big as those two oni that Yoon had fought on the\
  \ outskirts of Tsukiwa, they were about as relentless.</p> \n      <p>“OK, just\
  \ one more,” Yoon drew her arms back, sweeping one leg in an exaggerated spiral\
  \ she’d learned from a dancer at a roadside tavern (though she edited this part\
  \ out for the twins’ young ears). “What should your eonni call this one?” Flames\
  \ began to gather at her fingertips. Kyung-ja and Kyung-ok opened their mouths excitedly,\
  \ but—</p> \n      <p>“Yoon! Ease up on the stove!” Yoon’s aunt turned around from\
  \ where she was chopping vegetables. “Any more and we’ll burn our bottoms when we\
  \ sit down to eat!”</p> \n      <p>Groans of disappointment came from the twins,\
  \ deprived of their chance to see another of their cousin’s moves in action. “But\
  \ dinner’s almost ready. Why don’t you three set the table?” The groans turned to\
  \ cheers as food made its way out of the oven and delicious smells spilled forth.</p>\
  \ \n      <center>\n       <hr width=\"75%\">\n      </center> \n      <p>“So there\
  \ I was, the Gunpowder Gang all around me! They'd been skulking around the outskirts\
  \ of Okim for weeks, and they had made off with the latest shipment of firearms.\
  \ We tracked them to the edge of the forest, but they were holed up in a fort that\
  \ was covered in giant spiked walls and surrounded by explosive mines. The rest\
  \ of my team was stuck picking their way through the traps, but they couldn't keep\
  \ out Yoon! I gathered my flames below me and blasted into the air—you know, your\
  \ eonni can fly, sometimes.” She winked at the twins, whose mouths were hanging\
  \ open so wide that a bean sprout fell out onto Kyung-ja’s plate. </p> \n      <br>\

  \ took a spoonful of piping hot stew from the table, putting it over her rice, before\
  \ shifting a bit to pull her leg off the floor and onto a cushion. She hated to\
  \ admit it, but her aunt had been right, she really <em>had</em> gone a little overboard\
  \ with the stove that was now merrily warming the floors. “I landed in the middle\
  \ of more hobgoblins than you’ve ever seen! They were all around me, so Gom-Gom\
  \ came out to help.”</p> \n      <p>“Gom-Gom... came out?” Kyung-ok looked at the\
  \ ragged stuffed animal attached to the side Yoon’s bag.</p> \n      <p>“Yeah, like\
  \ this! I needed the backup,” Yoon waved her hand, conjuring flames in the shape\
  \ of her beloved stuffed toy. The flame jumped from her hand to land on the table,\
  \ where he struck a fighting pose.</p> \n      <p>Yoon’s uncle coughed once as he\
  \ poured Yoon a glass of clear spirits. “Yoon, Gom-Gom’s melting the ice, and I’\
  d hate to drink this expensive liquor at room temperature after you brought it all\
  \ the way here.”</p> \n      <p>“Ah, sorry, Imobu.” Yoon nodded as she took the\
  \ glass, turned away from the table, and drank it down. She turned back to the twins.\
  \ “Anyway, there we were, just me and Gom-Gom. He watched my back, breathing out\
  \ fire like PWOOSH, PWOOSH!” Yoon blew air in her little cousins’ faces. “I faced\
  \ forward and saw the Gunpowder Gang’s leader, a hobgoblin who was six—no, seven—\
  feet tall, holding a bomb in either hand. Do you know what I did?”</p> \n      <p>Yoon’\
  s aunt wiped at Kyung-ja’s mouth, “Did you shoot the bombs in his—”</p> \n     \
  \ <p>“I shot the bombs in his hands! They blew him backwards into the wall, putting\
  \ him down for the count! But his lackeys were spilling out, running around and\
  \ trying to arm their cannons. Gom-Gom and I leapt into the air as they fired and\
  \ the cannonballs exploded around the fort, and then I reached into the Plane of\
  \ Fire, pulling out as much flame as I could. Then—what should I call this one?”\
  <br><br>“Super-duper Phoenix Detonation!”<br>“Million Billion Shooting Stars!”<br>“\
  Gom-Gom Blaze Crusher!”</p> \n      <p>“Solar Flames in a Swirling Sphere!”</p>\
  \ \n      <p>“Eonni Blows Up the World!”</p> \n      <p>Yoon chuckled. “Let’s go\
  \ with Solar Detonation.” She continued the story of her overwhelming victory, while\
  \ her aunt rolled her eyes, her uncle laughed, and warmth filled the house.</p>\
  \ \n      <center>\n       <hr width=\"75%\">\n      </center> \n      <p>The twins\
  \ yawned as Yoon drew the covers up. “Do you really have to go in the morning?”\
  \ Kyung-ja asked.</p> \n      <p>Yoon ruffled her cousin’s hair. “I promised old\
  \ man Lim that I’d help guard his caravan on the way to Haseong. Not everyone’s\
  \ as invincible as me, you know, so I gotta help look out. But I'll be back before\
  \ the seasons change.” Kyung-ok opened her mouth to protest. “Before I go, what\
  \ colors do you two want?”</p> \n      <p>The protest turned to excitement. “Blue!”\
  <br><br></p> \n      <p>“Purple!”</p> \n      <p>“Blue and purple, coming right\
  \ up.” Yoon reached inwards, and with the slightest of breaths pulled two sparks\
  \ forth, one in either hand. With the gentlest of motions, she spun them, one into\
  \ a soft blue flicker and the other into a warm purple glow, and she set the two\
  \ spheres above each mattress, dimming them as she did so. It took a little bit\
  \ of her power, but Yoon had more than enough to spare on two nightlights for the\
  \ important task of watching over her cousins while she was away.</p> \n      <p>“\
  Be good now, the lights will know if you're naughty, and then I won't bring you\
  \ a present back from the city.” The nightlights had no such power, but the girls\
  \ didn't know that. The twins nodded vigorously, and soon were off to sleep.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Yoon shut the door and went back to the dining table. The morning would\
  \ bring more journeys and battles, but for tonight, she could go for another drink\
  \ with her uncle and another bite of her aunt's stew.</p> \n      <p style=\"margin-left:\
