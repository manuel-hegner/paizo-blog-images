  ><em>The Shroud of Four Silences</em></a>, the adventurers head to Stone Ring Pond,\

  \      <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Adventurers look to the water for a glimpse\
  \ of their fate. Illustration by Flrat Solhan.</p>\n     </div> \n     <h3>Stone\
  \ Ring Pond</h3> \n     <p>Stone Ring Pond sits high on a rise overlooking Otari.\
  \ One of the town’s most unusual and understated landmarks, the pond’s preternaturally\
  \ still waters are mirror-bright. Twenty-four standing stones, each 12 feet high,\
  \ surround the pond, their weathered surfaces bearing silent testament to their\
  \ age. Some Otari residents visit Stone Ring Pond to glimpse the future in the pool’\
  s still waters, but more come for the advice and guidance of the druids and itinerant\
  \ naturalists that camp around the pond. These people rarely invite visitors, as\
  \ they are folk far more at home in the wild than in a bustling town, but neither\
  \ do they turn away people asking for their advice. </p> \n     <p>A gnome druid\
  \ named Worliwynn has lived longer around Stone Ring Pond than the other denizens,\
  \ who tend to come and go with the seasons. Having lived near Stone Ring Pond for\
  \ 25 years, Worliwynn has taken it upon herself to educate and guide the fishers\
  \ and lumberjacks of Otari. She teaches them to improve their yields by protecting\
  \ the wilderness and not taking too much from nature. Worliwynn is one of Otari’\
  s most esteemed advisors, even though she hasn’t set foot within the town limits\
  \ for years.</p> \n     <p>Many of those who live near Stone Ring Pond are followers\
  \ of Gozreh, the god of wind and waves, and the water of the pond is sacred to these\
  \ Gozrens. Some make use of the following ritual to peer into the future.</p> \n\
  \     <h4>Waters of Prediction — Ritual 5</h4> \n     <p><b>Rare, Divination</b></p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>Cast </b> 4 hours; <b>Cost</b> rare incense and herbs worth a total\
  \ value of 300 gp; <b>Secondary Casters </b> 3</p> \n     <p><b>Primary Check</b>\
  \ Nature or Religion (master, the check has the secret trait); <b>Secondary Checks</b>\
  \ Nature, Occultism, Religion, or Survival</p> \n     <p><b>Range</b> 20 feet; <b>Targets</b>\
  \ 1 pool of water</p> \n     <p>You and the secondary casters peer into the still\
  \ waters of a natural pool or lake to divine your collective future. Over the course\
  \ of the minute following the ritual’s end, the waters display a scene of one possible\
  \ future involving the primary caster and as many secondary casters as feasible.\
  \ This scene is usually, but not necessarily, set within the next few days. The\
  \ future is unwritten, so the casters would be wise to not read guarantees into\
  \ the cryptic nature of the visions shown in the water.</p> \n     <p><b>Critical\
  \ Success</b> The scene gives hints as to at least one danger the casters are likely\
  \ to face, as well as at least one method of effectively addressing the danger (showing\
  \ the group examining an area of a wall containing a secret hatch to bypass a trap,\
  \ for example). </p> \n     <p><b>Success</b> The scene gives a hint as to at least\
  \ one danger the casters are likely to face, or some cryptic method to effectively\
  \ address or bypass a danger (such as a scene of lurking trolls, or a scene of the\
  \ casters lighting several torches and passing them out, but not both).</p> \n \
  \    <p><b>Failure</b> The scene consists of so many contradictory details that\
  \ it’s impossible to identify a single danger or effective course of action from\
  \ them.</p> \n     <p><b>Critical Failure</b> The scene is wrong; it shows the casters\
  \ facing a danger they’re unlikely to come across, or encourages actions that hinder\
  \ a likely upcoming encounter (such as encouraging chopping down several trees before\
  \ meeting an arboreal or a dryad).</p> \n     <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight:\
