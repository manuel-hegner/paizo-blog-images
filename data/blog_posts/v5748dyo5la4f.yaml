  \ Open Call Mistakes</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Friday, October 12, 2007</p> \n\
  \    <p>So, we're not going to have time to send out detailed feedback to everyone\
  \ who failed to make it to the second round of the Open Call for <i>W3: Flight of\
  \ the Red Raven</i>. But I know that people want to know what they did wrong, or\
  \ how they can improve for the future, for the next open call or for other endeavors.\
  \ With that in mind, here are the five most common mistakes people made that caused\
  \ me to reject the submission. </p> \n    <p><b>1. Novel-writing.</b> An adventure\
  \ is about the PCs. People who had experience submitting to <i>Dungeon</i> had an\
  \ advantage here, as it's something I've been saying for years. No matter how fascinating\
  \ your backstory is, no matter how many tangled plotlines you have between complex\
  \ NPCs, in the end, the most important thing I want to learn from your proposal\
  \ is: what happens to the PCs during this adventure? That is what most of the adventure\
  \ will be about, it's the only thing the players really care about, and it's the\
  \ basic quality upon which all adventures are ultimately judged. For that reason,\
  \ the most important questions were: \"What are the two obstacles?\" \"What does\
  \ the final encounter look like?\" and \"What is the new monster?\" The \"Who took\
  \ the object and why?\" question, while important, was probably the least interesting\
  \ question from my point of view. If you spent over half your proposal answering\
  \ this question, that's bad. </p> \n    <p><b>2. Details, details.</b> The module\
  \ failed to meet the minimum standards for either: following instructions, writing\
  \ quality, or some other \"mundane\" detail. Several of the queries I read did not\
  \ make any sense. Several more were rife with grammatical errors, spelling errors,\
  \ or other fundamental problems. And there were a few that were written almost entirely\
  \ in passive voice. Any of these things really hurt your chances. Also, I'll throw\
  \ one more mistake in this category. Several people based their adventure around\
  \ monsters, classes, or concepts that are Wizards of the Coast's IP. If your main\
  \ villain was a hexblade, or your most important monster was a nerra, your proposal\
  \ didn't get far. </p> \n    <p><b>3. Been there, done that.</b> The module simply\
  \ wasn't very creative. This is a hard one to quantify, and subject somewhat to\
  \ individual taste, but nevertheless, if your plot was straightforward, your challenges\
  \ predicable, your \"moral quandary\" at the end clich√©d, and your villain pulled\
  \ straight from a movie or book, then we weren't that interested. The best proposals,\
  \ the ones that got passed through to the next round, all contained at least one\
  \ element that provoked some kind of emotional response from the editors. Whether\
  \ we thought it was funny, tragic, romantic, creepy, exciting, or mysterious, the\
  \ important thing was that we got involved in the story. That's probably the hardest\
  \ thing to pull off with any proposal, but its also the most important. If you can\
  \ draw us into your adventure, we are going to want to print it. </p> \n    <p><b>4.\
  \ Overly ambitious.</b> The proposal was inappropriate for the level. There are\
  \ two ways this could happen. First of all, if your proposal involved monsters or\
  \ challenges that were clearly beyond what 4th-level characters could handle, it\
  \ was an easy pass, since it demonstrated that you didn't really know how the CR\
  \ system works. But there was another way you could trip up here too. 4th-level\
  \ characters are not equipped to save the world. If your plotline involved ancient\
  \ demons emerging from the Abyss to destroy the planet, or a mad lich plotting to\
  \ undo creation, you missed the point, even if the monsters themselves were the\
  \ right CR. At 4th level, the PCs are still just beginning their careers, if they\
  \ are facing epic forces and saving the world now, what will they be doing at level\
  \ 12? That's not to say that the PCs shouldn't be doing important things, but saving\
  \ the world is not in the cards, at least not yet. </p> \n    <p><b>5. Breaking\
  \ the toys.</b> The adventure created or modified a large amount of campaign setting\
  \ continuity. This is a simple matter of practicality. We don't want to blow up\
  \ cities or nations, destroy mountains, or make major shifts in the campaign setting\
  \ in the context of these modules. Especially when the writer doesn't have a lot\
  \ of history working with us. </p> \n    <p>I hope that gives you guys something\
  \ to go on for the next time around. In closing, I just want to thank you all for\
  \ submitting. There were lots of great ideas, and it was difficult, in the end,\
  \ to narrow it down to the right number. This won't be the last open call we do,\
  \ and I hope to see many of you again for the next time around.</p> \n    <p>Jeremy\
