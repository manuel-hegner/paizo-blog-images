  >the Red Raven</a>, his masked guise and alter ego.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n  \
  \   <p>Tumultuous Galt has captured the popular imagination—and noble nightmares—\
  as blood-drenched anarchy dominated by unscrupulous demagogues, anonymous executioners\
  \ known as the Gray Gardeners, frothing mobs that seek the destruction of a shattered\
  \ aristocracy, and imposing guillotines known as final blades that drink the souls\
  \ of the deceased. The madness has persisted for decades and consumed more than\
  \ a dozen failed governments, claiming countless lives and shattering as many families—\
  all in the name of liberty and the common good.</p> \n     <p>Aric was too young\
  \ to understand why the Gray Gardeners came, dragging his parents into the night\
  \ on charges of treason. He was too scared to watch as the final blade known as\
  \ Madame Margaery descended twice, and he was too lonely to stop crying on the ride\
  \ from the capital to his new home in the countryside. At Sister Sarinda's Home\
  \ for Revolutionary Orphans, he learned that he could not show too much anger, even\
  \ when forced to work too many hours sewing garments sold by his pitiless caretaker,\
  \ his wages garnished to supplement funds the revolutionary governments promised\
  \ but rarely delivered. While food was scarce, he was fed a torrent of “true” Galtan\
  \ values that changed with every coup.</p> \n     <p>Like his fellow orphans, Aric\
  \ eagerly absorbed these hateful lessons. However, where they believed themselves\
  \ young revolutionaries who might sniff out traitors, he could not forget the cruel\
  \ regime that had killed his parents and changed his life. He instead likened himself\
  \ to the folk heroes of legend who served the common people at the expense of foul\
  \ nobles. And so he ran away to live out his reckless fantasy.</p> \n     <p>He\
  \ didn't find freedom so much as bandits found him. Fortunately they also found\
  \ young Aric's dream amusing, and the aging leader Thanarus accepted the boy as\
  \ his protégé. As Aric quickly learned, the bandits were not unprincipled thieves;\
  \ the Revolution had wronged every one of them, much as it had wronged him. As a\
  \ former knight who had seen the anarchy consume everything he held dear decades\
  \ before, Thanarus had suffered longest of all. Nonetheless, he had upheld the old\
  \ oaths of conduct sworn so long ago, and instructed Aric in the ways of mercy and\
  \ morality, hoping to banish the hatred that burned within his pupil's heart. Thanarus\
  \ also taught him the arts of the battlefield, acknowledging that no amount of integrity\
  \ could keep a man safe in their tumultuous land.</p> \n     <p>These relatively\
  \ happy times could not last. The merciless eyes of the Gray Gardeners inevitably\
  \ turned upon Thanarus and his daring exploits, capturing him and his followers\
  \ just before Aric returned from an errand in Woodsedge. By the time Aric pushed\
  \ his way into Isarn, Thanarus was already dead—one more spirit consumed by Madame\
  \ Margaery, body unceremoniously thrown from the city's crumbling walls, and victim\
  \ of the current Revolutionary Council, known as the Council of Skulls. Aric waited\
  \ until nightfall, chased away the scavengers, and buried his mentor by moonlight,\
  \ keeping only the shredded cloak and ivory cameo of a bygone age that Thanarus\
  \ had worn so proudly.</p> \n     <p>What followed was a blur of nights, weeks,\
  \ and months spent seeking revenge against the council and Galt's corruption. Aric—\
  now garbed in scarlet and Thanarus's cloak to hide his identity—tracked down and\
  \ destroyed the Council of Skulls' inner circle. Hardly a morning passed without\
  \ some citizen discovering a dead senator being scavenged by gruesome ravens that\
  \ cawed with pride. In time, the people of Galt gave this crimson killer a name:\
  \ the Red Raven.</p> \n     <p>The Council of Skulls buckled under the Red Raven's\
  \ attacks and the demagoguery of their political rivals. The bloodthirsty mobs overthrew\
  \ the regime and elected a new council headed by Citizen Korran Goss, who invited\
  \ the red-garbed vigilante to help rebuild Galt and stop those who would perpetuate\
  \ anarchy. At first the tasks were simple: deliver a message here and spy on a conspirator\
  \ there. Then the requests grew in their violence: the breaking of an arm to send\
  \ a warning or the apprehension of a traitor. Donning his mask gave Aric the courage\
  \ to act and suppressed the mercy Thanarus had taught behind a faceless mien of\
  \ unforgiving justice. As Citizen Goss's requests grew increasingly bloody, Aric\
  \ began questioning his own role and whether the Red Raven was truly serving Galt\
  \ or merely perpetuating a new generation of hatred. By night, the Red Raven could\
  \ bury these doubts. By day, Aric couldn't help but voice his concerns, hoping to\
  \ unearth some method behind the madness—or at least find true allies among the\
  \ angry mobs. Driven by his passion and Thanarus's training, Aric's words began\
  \ to find purchase in sympathetic ears. Unfortunately, they also reached the Revolutionary\
  \ Council, and Citizen Goss quietly signed Aric's death warrant, contacting the\
  \ only man he trusted to apprehend the miscreant: the Red Raven.</p> \n     <p>With\
  \ the signed orders in hand, the Red Raven set off across the city while grappling\
  \ with the irony of his task: the capture of his secret identity by his masked guise.\
  \ Questions coursed through his mind. How could he, the Red Raven, survive the night\
  \ without sacrificing the seductive fame in which he reveled? How could he convince\
  \ Citizen Goss to reconsider? At last, he paused atop a roof and tore the mask from\
  \ his face. “How?” he asked. “How can I delude myself? The Red Raven was supposed\
  \ to end tyranny, yet here I am the worst tyrant of them all.”</p> \n     <p>Citizen\
  \ Goss awoke to delightful news. The knave Aric of Halvon had been captured and\
  \ left on the front steps of the council building, and the Red Raven had left a\
  \ personal note praying that Aric's death would bring Galt one step closer to freedom.\
  \ Goss cackled his approval when Aric's sham trial delivered a guilty verdict, and\
  \ congratulated himself when the Gray Gardeners threw Aric into prison to await\
  \ execution. His mirth only faded when the Red Raven stopped answering his summons.\
  \ There was no sign of the masked hero. Even the ashes of the vigilante's incinerated\
  \ costume had been swept from the street the day before. And in the prison Aric\
  \ found peace.</p> \n     <p>However, not all were content to let another innocent\
  \ fall to Madame Magaery, especially one so outspoken as Aric. In the dead of night,\
  \ his cell door swung open, and an aging legal clerk by the name of Quinn extended\
  \ a hand to help Aric to his feet. Together they fled south to Taldor, evading bounty\
  \ hunters and exchanging tales of noble souls who had fallen prey to Galt's bloodlust.\
  \ Where guilt wracked Aric with memories of the lives he had taken, Quinn was resolute,\
  \ dedicated to aiding the falsely accused no matter the price. Aric could not help\
  \ but find strength in his savior's words and actions. They parted ways soon thereafter,\
  \ Quinn vowing to one day lay low the red-cloaked vigilante who had captured Aric.\
  \ Aric in turn silently promised to uphold the ideals that Thanarus had taught him\
  \ so long ago, and that Quinn had reinforced.</p> \n     <p>Aric has wandered ever\
  \ since, wielding his courtly charms as an outspoken defender of liberty and peace.\
  \ Thanarus's cameo once more serves as a reminder of the virtues Aric hopes to uphold—\
  and the cost of losing himself in a cycle of violence. Yet charisma cannot vanquish\
  \ all evils. When nothing can stop an injustice but cold steel, Aric dons his recreated\
  \ disguise, and the Red Raven flies once more.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>John\
