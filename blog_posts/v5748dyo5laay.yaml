  \ Roleplaying Game Preview #1</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Wednesday, May 13, 2009</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Just under two weeks ago, we shipped the <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8255\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook</i></a> to the printer. Over the next\
  \ 14 weeks, we will be giving you an inside look at the final game, looking at each\
  \ class in turn and exploring other elements of the game.</p> \n   <p>But first,\
  \ we are taking a look at the Table of Contents for the <i>Core Rulebook</i>. As\
  \ you can see, the book comes in at a mighty 576 pages. It includes a 56-page classes\
  \ chapter (which now contains all the of the rules for arcane schools, bloodlines,\
  \ and domains), a 150-page spells chapter, and a 98-page magic items chapter (which\
  \ also includes all of the rules for intelligent items, cursed items, artifacts,\
  \ and magic item creation). We slotted the prestige class chapter in right after\
  \ spells, making roughly the first 400 pages filled with player-focused rules and\
  \ material. Rounding out the end of the book is a super-handy 4-page index which\
  \ includes just about every reference we could think up.</p> \n   <p>But that is\
  \ not all. This week, we are also showing off a spread from the races chapter. The\
  \ entire interior of the book has been giving a fantastic treatment by Sarah Robinson,\
  \ the project’s lead art director and graphic designer. We felt it was important\
  \ for this book to get the races looking just right, so we ordered brand new art\
  \ for each of the core races.</p> \n   <p>On the opposite page, we get a good look\
  \ at the dwarf, one of my favorite races. Aside from some new flavor text that describes\
  \ dwarven traits, there have been only a few changes to the dwarf from the Beta\
  \ Playtest version of the game. Most of these were made to clean up the race and\
  \ bring it inline with the new rules. That said, there is one significant thing\
  \ that has changed. I’ll let you figure out which element that is.</p> \n   <p>That’\
  s all for this week. In week 2 of our 14-week preview, we’re going to take a look\
  \ at Valeros, the iconic fighter. Writing up his stat block is quite a feat!</p>\
