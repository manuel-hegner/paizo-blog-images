  \ Four</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Wednesday, March 11, 2009</p> \n   <p>I love\
  \ it when a plan comes together. We had pressed forward with our arrangement, but\
  \ suddenly discovered a new element that had to be overcome—a lone guard. We decided\
  \ to do the only smart and reasonable thing... kill him. After we feathered our\
  \ foe, Sean sketched a quick depiction of the quite-deader-than-dead fella, and\
  \ then we continued on our merry way, straight into an encounter fest. We only made\
  \ it a short way in before Sean called it a night, and right now we're chasing down\
  \ a cowardly fiend who just locked himself behind a door.</p> \n   <p>Much to our\
  \ surprise, not only did nobody die this time, but we actually did really well.\
  \ I think it's because I finally remembered my dice.</p> \n   <p>One thing I'd like\
  \ to mention is how I've never had a GM so cunningly use (or insist upon) the rules\
  \ for light radius. (And, apparently, neither have my 3 companions, since I'm the\
  \ only one who bought any torches during character creation.) Anyway, I've decided\
  \ that I like it. It's been adding a whole new dimension to our tactics, which is\
  \ always fun. In fact, in one of the earlier sessions (I believe the first), our\
  \ dwarf and some of the \"enemy\" got into this fun little game of tossing torches\
  \ back and forth in attempts to grant visibility to one's side while denying it\
  \ for the other. In this last session, our rogue, who had languished behind for\
  \ a round to recover his crossbow, was literally left in the dark, which greatly\
  \ affected his options.</p> \n   <p>So, during the next episode of \"Bastards of\
  \ Erebus,\" will our heroes continue on to victory? Will the players finally remember\
  \ to bring their dice? Will their characters remember to buy some sort of illuminating\
  \ device? Tune it next time to find out!</p> \n   <p>Hank Woon <br>Editorial Intern</p>\
