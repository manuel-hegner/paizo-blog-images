  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Dust settled, leaving two\
  \ figures behind in the carnage. One a looming mass of hulking muscle and teeth.\
  \ The other a gnome, small, but—against all odds—still up.</p> \n     <p>Torrick\
  \ Wilderbark grasped the lever of his wheelchair in a white-knuckle grip, jaw set\
  \ hard. His breaths came laboured, tongue caked with a layer of grit and grime.\
  \ The warehouse lay shattered around them. Broken boards and timbers cracked further\
  \ under the weight of his wheels. Behind him, the steam engine that powered his\
  \ aid thrummed, vibrating against the seat in a steady rhythm.</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ troll had been pushed back, pulling itself out from under a pile of broken stone\
  \ and cracked roof tiles. It mumbled a growl as it staggered upright, wobbly at\
  \ first, but centering itself with every passing second. Dark blood oozed from its\
  \ stunted snout. Torrick fumbled for the sword strapped behind the right wheel.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>His hand closed around air.</p> \n     <p>An ice-cold wave of dread\
  \ crashed over him. <em>His sword</em>. Pathetically trying to tamp down the rising\
  \ panic in his throat, Torrick turned in the seat, twisting as far as he could as\
  \ the safety belts bit into his thighs. Not only the sword but the scabbard was\
  \ gone, too. The belt securing his gear must have snapped during the collapse, and,\
  \ rattled by the all-consuming barrage of fractured stone and wood, he had failed\
  \ to notice.</p> \n     <p>Mere feet away, the troll whined in pain.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>Letting go of the lever, Torrick gripped the arms of the chair, straining further\
  \ to look around him. The beast may be stunned for now, but it was rapidly regaining\
  \ focus. Hard leather straps dug further into his legs, and he winced against it,\
  \ taking in his surroundings.</p> \n     <p>Nothing much was left of the warehouse.\
  \ What little remained jutted out of the ground at odd angles, still crumbling.\
  \ Splintered wood protruded like snapped bones, pinned by blasted chunks of stone\
  \ and shattered glass. The alchemical bomb he’d tossed had certainly done the job.\
  \ Torrick was lucky to be alive.</p> \n     <p>But severely unluckily, the troll\
  \ was, too.</p> \n     <p>As his gaze scoured the rubble, a glint caught his eye—\
  a flash of steel. A mere few feet away, snagged tight around a listing beam, was\
  \ the remains of his gear, the belt pierced through by a nail and tangled about\
  \ the shaft of the scabbard. And there, by some great mercy from the gods, hung\
  \ his sword.</p> \n     <p>He had no time to think, no plan. Every moment wasted\
  \ was one in the monster’s favor. Torrick fell back down into his seat and clutched\
  \ at the lever once more. The bubbling panic in his throat was not yet sated. He\
  \ needed to get his sword. <em>Now</em>. Steam hissing, the engine roared up as\
  \ the chair heeded his command, veering right and toward the dangling weapon. Debris\
  \ clattered and cracked loudly under the wheels, but he couldn’t care less about\
  \ the racket he was making. He was close, so close. The weapon hung before him,\
  \ taunting. Torrick reached out, free arm straining as though he could somehow will\
  \ it into his hand.</p> \n     <p><em>Come on</em>, he thought, pleaded. To any\
  \ deity that cared to listen. The chair stopped, his fingers barely made contact,\
  \ ghosting over the handle of the blade. He needed to get just a little higher,\
  \ reach a little further, then he could—</p> \n     <p>A thunderous roar shook the\
  \ very ground.</p> \n     <p>Torrick spat a curse.</p> \n     <p>Heavy footfalls,\
  \ blackened claws scraping. It lumbered closer, with a loping gait that swiftly\
  \ ate away at the distance between them. Torrick’s pulse pounded in his ears as\
  \ he fumbled. Another roar, a deep bellowing sound that vibrated in his chest and\
  \ sent him frantic, straining to reach higher, shoulder burning in its socket, hips\
  \ protesting at the bruising line of the security belt.</p> \n     <p><em>Almost\
  \ there. Just a little further. Come on. Please—</em></p> \n     <p>The troll fell\
  \ upon him in a flurry of limbs and gnashing tusks. Torrick immediately dropped\
  \ back into the seat, tucking in as small as he could as the pressing weight of\
  \ the angered beast threatened to consume him. In its rage, it had overshot its\
  \ mark, instead grappling the frame of the wheelchair and barely missing Torrick’\
  s body; the tips of razor-sharp claws snagging on his armor.</p> \n     <p>And yet\
  \ hope. Clutched in his hand, cool against sweaty fingers, was the sword. Held in\
  \ a white-knuckle grip.</p> \n     <p>Lunging again for the lever, Torrick twisted\
  \ awkwardly to avoid the troll knocking the weapon out of his hand. He pulled hard\
  \ enough that the metal screeched and the engine almost backfired, revving so loudly\
  \ it almost drowned out the sound of heavy-set limbs pawing at the wheels. Lurching\
  \ abruptly backward, the chair shunted its way out from under the troll’s crushing\
  \ form, the creature’s claws scrabbling at the frame.</p> \n     <p>With the chair\
  \ now pulled out from under it, the monster stumbled to adjust and pitched forward,\
  \ grunting in confusion, its brow furrowed deep and hard. Torrick wasted no time,\
  \ taking no chances as he let go of the shaft and slipped a vial from a pouch at\
  \ his belt, smashing it against the flat of his blade as the wheelchair continued\
  \ to roll back on its own.</p> \n     <p>The vial shattered easily, oil inside bleeding\
  \ down the groove before reacting with the air. The effect was immediate: a tongue\
  \ of fire that blazed brightly. With a victorious bark of laughter, Torrick kicked\
  \ the lever forward once more with his foot, using both arms to drive all the strength\
  \ he had into a wide swing.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"\
