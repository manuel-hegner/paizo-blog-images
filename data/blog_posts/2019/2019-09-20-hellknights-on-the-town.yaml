               <blockquote>
                <p itemprop="description">Last week, we took our first big look at the Firebrands, a brand new organization premiering in the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01zt4?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Character-Guide">Lost Omens Character Guide</a> (releasing in just a few weeks!). While new organizations are fun, people familiar with the Age of Lost Omens will have lots of classics to look forward to as well. Pathfinder has had plenty of iconic figures throughout its history including our <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/tags/iconicEncounters">iconic characters</a> like Seelah and Valeros, as well as the Gray Maidens that featured on the back of the original Core Rulebook. Among some of these more memorable figures are the Hellknights, the imposing paragons of law.</p>

                </div>
                <p>The Hellknights are a widespread organization that spans the Inner Sea region, though many of its orders are located within Cheliax. At its core, the organization is dedicated to enforcing and upholding law and order. The Hellknights believe the letter of the law to be absolute and understand that without a commitment to law, the world is under threat of succumbing to the terrors of chaos and disorder.</p>
                <div class="blurbCenter">

                </div>
                <p>Hellknights follow a massive set of laws and virtues known as the Measure and the Chain. The Measure collects all of the countless laws and strictures that make up the Hellknights’ code. These laws take inspiration from the structure and order of Hell itself, with many Hellknights seeing the order of Hell as something to aspire to and emulate. The Chain presents the Hellknights’ most important virtues: order, discipline, and mercilessness. Keeping these ideals in mind, the Hellknights seek out lawbreakers and those who threaten the stability of order, punishing them to the utmost extent of the law regardless of the crimes committed. Compassion of any kind leads to anarchy and, as all are guilty of some infraction, no mercy shall be spared for those who break the law.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Characters who want to become Hellknights will have to undergo rigorous training to even be considered for entrance into the Hellknights. This training is represented in the form of the Hellknight armiger archetype, originally found in the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01zoj?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-World-Guide">Lost Omens World Guide</a>. Since every Hellknight has to be an armiger first, it’s a very important archetype for would-be Hellknights. In fact, it’s so important that we decided to expand on the archetype just a bit by providing new feats to support it! Once you go through the process of becoming an armiger, you are faced with the Hellknight Test in which you fight a devil in one on one combat. Succeed and you become a full-fledged Hellknight. Fail and you die. Pretty simple. Once you become a Hellknight, you have access to the Hellknight’s signature armor!</p>
                <div class="blurbCenter">
                 <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20191920-hellknightplate.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20191920-hellknightplate_500.png" alt="Hellknight Plate, Item 2. Uncommon, Bulwark. Price 35 gp; Usage worn armor; Bulk 4; AC Bonus +6; Dex Cap +0; Check Penalty –3; Speed Penalty –10 feet; Strength 18; Type Heavy; Group Plate. Few armors in the entire Inner Sea region are as memorable as the iconic Hellknight plate. While each order has their own flourishes, Hellknight plate is instantly recognizable to any who know of the Hellknights. Hellknights go to extreme measures to punish non-Hellknights who get their hands on Hellknight plate, and the reward is not usually worth the risk, as the armor is functionally similar to full plate."></a>
                </div>
                <p>The Hellknights are not a monolith. Though every Hellknight follows the Measure and the Chain, the organization is broken into several orders, each of which have a different focus. The Order of the Chain (who were the stars of a recent <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgwo?Tales-of-Lost-Omens-Rat-Trap">piece of fiction</a> by Liane Merciel) are dedicated to tracking down criminals who have eluded the hand of the law, at least for the moment. The Order of the Pyre instead focuses on rooting out religions, philosophies, and scientific endeavors that could disrupt the status quo. The Hellknights have seven major orders, which are detailed in the book as well as several smaller orders that feature brief descriptions.</p>
                <div class="blurbCenter">
                 <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20191920-pyrehellknight.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20191920-pyrehellknight_500.jpeg" alt="An Order of the Pyre Hellknight in spiked blue-gray armor raises a hand wreathed in blue glowing magical energy."></a>
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">Illustration by Maichol Quinto</p>
                </div>
                <p>Characters that become members of the Hellknights must join one of these orders in order to become a full-fledged Hellknight. Because each order has a distinctive focus, we wanted to provide options to characters that better represent their affiliation with their respective orders. To that end, we created a new set of feats, Order Training and Advanced Order Training, to allow Hellknight characters to gain unique abilities that are only available to their order. Both of these feats are available to Hellknights, Hellknight Signifers, and Hellknight armigers, so you can access these abilities regardless of where you are along your career path. The Order Training feat gives you lesser abilities, like the Order of the Nail’s ability to ignore non-magical difficult terrain, while the Advanced Order Training gives greater power, like the blessing available to members of the Order of the Godclaw.</p>
                <div class="blurbCenter">
                 <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20191920-ordertraining.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20191920-ordertraining_500.png" alt="Order Training, Feat 8.

                </div>
                <div class="blurbCenter">
                 <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20191920-blessingofthefive.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20191920-blessingofthefive_500.png" alt="Blessing of the Five, Greater Benefit. Concentrate, Divine, Healing, Manipulate, Necromancy, Positive. Frequency once per day. You call out to the Godclaw to heal your allies. You cast the three-action version of heal, heightened to a level 1 lower than half your level rounded up. You can select up to four creatures in the area to remain unaffected by the spell. You can instead use this ability to bring a creature within 30 feet that has died within the last round back from the dead. If you do, the creature is restored to 1 hit point and is doomed 1 for 24 hours."></a>
                </div>
                <p>Unfortunately, we only had enough space to get order abilities for the seven major orders. If and when we get a chance to look at the Hellknights again (maybe in a book focused on Old Cheliax? Who knows! Let us know if you want that!) we will get a chance to expand further on the orders and provide new options. In addition to the above options, the book provides details on the various ranks among the Hellknights, such as Maralictor and Paralictor, as well as information on the Lictors of each of the Hellknight orders. Of course, I would be remiss if I didn’t mention one of the biggest options available in this book: the Hellknight and Hellknight signifier archetypes!</p>
                <div class="blurbCenter">
                 <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20191920-gatehellknight.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20191920-gatehellknight_500.jpeg" alt="An Order of the Gate Hellknight in a red cloak and hood, face hidden by a swirling magical vortex, raises one hand crackling with fiery magical energy."></a>

                </div>
                <p>Building off of the Hellknight armiger archetype, these two archetypes allow Hellknight characters to reach their full potential. Hellknights are fierce warriors clad in Hellknight armor and bringing about brutal justice wherever they go. Hellknights are the big, tough combatants among the organization and have different abilities to represent that, like the scaling of their proficiency in Hellknight plate and attacks like the Blade of Law.</p>
                <div class="blurbCenter">
                 <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190920-bladeoflaw.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190920-bladeoflaw_500.png" alt="Blade of Law, Feat 12. Archetype. Prerequisites Hellknight Dedication. You call upon the power of law and make a weapon or unarmed Strike against a foe you have witnessed breaking or disrespecting the law or otherwise acting disorderly. The Strike deals two extra weapon damage dice if the target of your Strike is chaotic. Whether or not the target is chaotic, you can choose to convert all the physical damage from the attack into lawful damage."></a>
                </div>
                <p>Hellknight signifers on the other hand are more focused on spellcasting. They typically provide support to other Hellknights on the battlefield, but are no less dangerous and dedicated than their fellow Hellknights. Signifers wear unique masks that in addition to being quite intimidating, also grant unique abilities. For example, with the Signifer’s Sigh feat you gain darkvision and lessen the effects of being dazzled, while Gaze of Veracity feat allows you to cast <em>glimpse the truth</em> as a focus spell.</p>
                <div class="blurbCenter">
                 <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20191920-signiferdedication.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20191920-signiferdedication_500.png" alt="Hellknight Signifer Dedication, Feat 6. Uncommon, Archetype, Dedication. Prerequisites spellcasting class feature, Hellknight Armiger Dedication, lawful alignment, member of a Hellknight order, passed the Hellknight Test. You have bolstered your force of will with the power of the Measure and the Chain. Upon initiation, you receive a signifier mask, often devoid of eyeholes or other decorative features. The mask doesn’t obscure your vision, though it makes it impossible for others to see your eyes. While wearing your signifer’s mask, you gain +1 circumstance bonus to Deception checks to Lie, Intimidation checks, and Deception DCs against Sense Motive. You gain expert proficiency in Intimidation (or in another skill in which you’re trained of your choice if you were already an expert in Intimidation) as well as in your choice of Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion. Special: You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Hellknight signifer or Hellknight armiger archetypes."></a>
                </div>
                <p>If you’re looking to learn more about the Hellknights or even consider joining their ranks, make sure to read Amanda Hamon’s work in the Lost Omens Character Guide. If you like the idea of playing a knight, but prefer to focus more on saving the day and helping others rather than just brutally upholding the law, consider checking out our preview of the Knights of Lastwall next week! Either way, make sure to check out the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01zt4?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Character-Guide">Lost Omens Character Guide</a> when it releases on October 16th. It’s a Hell of a treat!</p>
