  artist: "the target. Suffice to say, you do not want to be on the receiving end\
    \ of a paladin's smite evil. There have been a few other changes to the paladin\
    \ as well. Whenever she uses detect evil, she can focus on one target, to the\
    \ exclusion of all others, to learn if that target is evil in just 1 round. In\
    \ addition, her spellcasting progression is a little bit faster now (matching\
    \ the ranger's), it is based off her Charisma modifier, and her effective caster\
    \ level is her paladin level â€“3. Most of her spells are pretty straight forward,\
    \ but there have been some changes to protection"
