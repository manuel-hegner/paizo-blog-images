  \   <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Over the last few weeks, we’\
  ve looked at a number of monsters featured in the upcoming <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01ztb?Pathfinder-Battles-Legendary-Adventures\"\
  >Pathfinder Battles: Legendary Adventures</a> set of pre-painted plastic miniatures\
  \ from our partners at WizKids, but we haven’t yet jumped into the many player-character\
  \ options the set supports. Luckily, when we were gearing up for the launch of Pathfinder\
  \ Second Edition, we asked iconic Pathfinder artist Wayne Reynolds to produce some\
  \ concept art of what the various ancestries of the game would look like if designed\
  \ from the ground up. This resulted in some slight changes in proportions among\
  \ halflings and dwarves, for example, that we wanted to make sure were reflected\
  \ in the earliest set released after Second Edition’s launch.</p> \n     <p>First,\
  \ let’s look at dwarves! The set features three dwarves to cover a variety of character\
  \ rolls: the uncommon Dwarf Champion and Dwarf Rogue and the rare Dwarf Sorcerer.\
  \ These figures can, respectively, easily double for a Toragdan cleric or fighter,\
  \ a knife-wielding monk or spellcaster, and a bard, cleric, or wizard.</p> \n  \

  \ alt=\"A white-haired Dwarf Sorcerer confidently wields a staff on her right hand,\
  \ purple magic swirling around her.\"></a> \n     </div> \n     <p>Next alphabetically\
  \ we have elves, whose first figure in the set appeared in the Legendary Adventures\
  \ Preview Pack earlier this month. A variant version of the same sculpt is included\
  \ in the full set as a common figure we showed off two weeks ago. The second elf\
  \ in the series is actually two different figures based on the same mold, one wielding\
  \ two swords and the other drawing a bow. Elf Ranger is a Medium uncommon figure\
  \ with an a/b designation to its collector’s number.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ alt=\"A bow-wielding Elven Ranger stalks his prey.\"></a> \n     </div> \n   \
  \  <p>Gnext come the gnomes! Legendary Adventures features two gnomes, both Small:\
  \ the common Gnome Rogue and rare Gnome Fighter. The rogue can double as just about\
  \ any lightly-armored gnome character, though her brightly colored hair and outfit\
  \ might make her stand out a bit. The polearm-wielding fighter can likewise serve\
  \ as a champion or barbarian, so long as you’re fine with his colorful and mismatched\
  \ armor.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/081919_Gnome_Rogue.jpg\"\

  \ alt=\"A heavily armored Gnome Soldier with a green beard and eyebrows stands at\
  \ attention, halberd at the ready.\"></a> \n     </div> \n     <p>Ever in the shadow\
  \ of their taller kin, halflings round out the PC options in today’s preview. The\
  \ Preview Pack included the Halfling Slinger, whose alternative paint scheme we\
  \ showed off previously, but we’ve also got two rare halflings in the set that I\
  \ believe are the coolest halfling minis ever produced. The Halfling Druid exhibits\
  \ the multifunctional nature of many halfling items with her staff holding a teapot\
  \ that also probably has magic spell components or healing herbs in it. Meanwhile,\
  \ the aged Halfling Wizard makes up for his diminutive size with a stern look and\
  \ a fiery spell effect.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/081919_Halfling_Druid.jpg\"\

  \ alt=\"A bald-headed Halfling Wizard with bushy sideburns scowls over his eyeglasses\

  \    <p>Not all roughly human-shaped figures in the set are appropriate for PCs,\
  \ or even restricted to Medium or Small sizes. The Ashen Man, for example, who first\
  \ appeared in the Pathfinder Playtest adventure Doomsday Dawn, has the potential\
  \ to be a recurring villain in the Age of Lost Omens, and his plans and influence\
  \ extend far beyond the constraints of that module. A Large rare figure, the mysterious\
  \ foe can stand in for any enlarged spellcaster or mist-shrouded undead.</p> \n\

  \ when the Legendary Adventures set allows the chance to do some of the Huge giants\
  \ we’ve been unable to produce in plastic form thus far? Check out the Storm Giant\
  \ and both versions of the Cloud Giant (all Huge uncommon figures) to complete your\
