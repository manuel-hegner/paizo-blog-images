  \   </div> \n   <p>So far we’ve revealed plenty of monstrous menaces soon to appear\
  \ on your game table as part of this summer’s new Rise of the Runelords Pathfinder\
  \ Battles prepainted miniatures set. This week, we’ll bring things back to earth\
  \ with a look at some familiar friends you just might recognize from the Pathfinder\
  \ world.</p> \n   <p>Before I get into the new miniature reveals, I need to point\
  \ out that we still don’t have all of the specifics about when exactly this set\
  \ will come out, how much it will cost, or how many figures will be in each booster\
  \ box, but things have been moving steadily forward on these fronts, and I expect\
  \ to be able to reveal details shortly.</p> \n   <p>Until then, we wait. I hope\
  \ to soothe the ennui by showing off more awesome miniatures from the set.</p> \n\
  \   <p>These miniatures support the <a href=\"/products/btpy8mqq\">Rise of the Runelords\
  \ Adventure Path Anniversary Edition</a>, which is scheduled for a July release.\
  \ The images shown below are “paint masters,” meaning they are the painted miniatures\
  \ our partners at WizKids send to their factories as guides for how the production\
  \ run should be painted. Expect a little variance between these images and the final\
  \ miniatures, but this is what they’ll be shooting for.</p> \n   <p>Because these\
  \ are pre-production images, they’re also missing some of the fine detail work on\
  \ things like tattoos, fine costume design details, and similar flourishes. These\
  \ are added at the factory as a final step, so if it looks like Seoni is missing\
  \ a few tattoos below, don’t despair! They’re coming soon!</p> \n   <p>Anyway, on\
  \ to this week’s previews!</p> \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    <a href=\"\
  /image/content/Blog/120217-Ameiko_360.jpeg\"><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/120217-Ameiko_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n   </div> \n   <p>This uncommon figure represents Ameiko Kaijitsu,\
  \ one of Pathfinder’s very first NPCs, and one who has grown to become an important\
  \ figure in the Pathfinder world thanks to the events of the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/jadeRegent\"\
  >Jade Regent Adventure Path</a>. Way back in the Rise of the Runelords AP, Ameiko\
  \ was a simple owner of Sandpoint’s Rusty Dragon Inn, but she went on to become\
  \ a very important figure whose destiny spans the globe of Golarion. She appears\
  \ here kitted out in her adventuring gear, ready to help your player characters\
  \ in either campaign.</p> \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/120217-Shalelu_360.jpeg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/120217-Shalelu_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n  \
  \ </div> \n   <p>The elf fighter/ranger Shalelu Andosana is older than the town\
  \ of Sandpoint itself, but over the centuries she’s come to view the place as home.\
  \ She makes an excellent ally and information source for the players in Rise of\
  \ the Runelords, and her appearance in the Jade Regent Adventure Path means that\
  \ this uncommon miniature, like Ameiko above, comes in doubly useful for Pathfinder\
  \ GMs running both campaigns. Plus, female elf ranger with a bow = great miniature\
  \ for lots and lots and lots of player characters.</p> \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n    <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/120217-Harsk_360.jpeg\"><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/120217-Harsk_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n   </div> \n   <p>So far we’ve managed to fit an iconic character\
  \ or two into each of our Pathfinder Battles releases, and Rise of the Runelords\
  \ is no exception. The first iconic in this set (an uncommon) is Harsk, the iconic\
  \ ranger. I love the detail WizKids was able to achieve with Harsk’s face, and some\
  \ of the detail on his outfit is absolutely amazing. Artists and sculptors always\
  \ complain about Wayne Reynolds’s highly complex original art for Harsk, but we\
  \ think WizKids did a great job capturing the detail and nuance of this popular\
  \ character.</p> \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/120217-Seoni_360.jpeg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/120217-Seoni_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n   </div>\
  \ \n   <p>Speaking of popular iconic characters, they don’t come more popular than\
  \ this lovely lass, the inimitable Seoni! Seoni made her debut on one of the covers\
  \ of the original Rise of the Runelords Adventure Path issues, so we knew we had\
  \ to include her in the set (at the uncommon rarity). And I’m thrilled that we did.\
  \ WizKids definitely met the challenge with this figure. The picture above is pretty\
  \ good, but in-hand this miniature is absolutely gorgeous, with a great color to\
  \ it and lots of excellent sculpt details. Fans of Seoni might notice that her tattoos\
  \ and some of the pattern on her outfit is missing. As I mentioned above, that stuff\
  \ will be coming at the factory, and what we’ve seen so far looks terrific.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>That’s it for this week! The <a href=\"/products/btpy8mqq\">Rise of the\
  \ Runelords Adventure Path</a> is a dangerous campaign, but these familiar faces\
  \ will help you make it through alive, if not exactly unscathed!</p> \n   <p>Until\
  \ next week,</p> \n   <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p> \n  </blockquote> <!--\
