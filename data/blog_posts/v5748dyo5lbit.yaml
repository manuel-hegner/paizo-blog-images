  \  <p class=\"date\">Thursday, October 14, 2010</p> \n    <p>You'd think that sooner\
  \ or later I'd get tired of these \"It is coming!\" preview blogs. Unfortunately,\
  \ you would be wrong.</p> \n    <p>While <i><a href=\"/store/v5748btpy8h6j\">Winter\
  \ Witch</a></i> isn't yet in the warehouse, the print run <i>has</i> arrived in\
  \ Seattle's port, where it currently lies brooding underneath the apocalyptic skyline\
  \ of cranes and fenced-off train yards. (Seriously—sometimes I drive by the port\
  \ at night just to imagine what a dystopian future might look like.) As a result,\
  \ we've managed to get our hands on a few early copies, and we're extremely excited.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Although I won't speak to the differences between the stories of <i><a\
  \ href=\"/store/v5748btpy8h6j\">Winter Witch</a></i> and <i><a href=\"/store/v5748btpy8g3n\"\
  >Prince of Wolves</a></i> just now—you can read the summaries and <a href=\"/pathfinder/tales\"\
  >see them for yourself here</a>—I will speak to the production values and say that\
  \ we've made some aesthetic improvements this time around. Our debut novel was gorgeous,\
  \ but with an improved paper stock and an increased font size for added readability,\
  \ <i><a href=\"/store/v5748btpy8h6j\">Winter Witch</a></i> is even thicker and meatier.\
  \ It also features a brand new map of the region in which the story's set, by our\
  \ own talented Crystal Frasier, and all the Pathfinder Tales novels going forward\
  \ will have maps in the front. At Paizo, we aren't afraid to tweak the formula and\
  \ make improvement as ideas occur to us, and it's our hope that if you liked <i><a\
  \ href=\"/store/v5748btpy8g3n\">Prince of Wolves</a></i>, this book will give you\
  \ that much more to love!</p> \n    <p>Now to go stand by the viaduct, look longingly\
  \ out toward the port, and try to figure out which cargo container is ours...</p>\
