  \ RPG Beta Preview #2</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Friday, July 18, 2008</p> The\
  \ Beta Playtest Edition of the <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG\"><i>Pathfinder Roleplaying\
  \ Game</i></a> is off to the printer and is due to be released in mid August. In\
  \ anticipation, we are previewing some of the changes made from the Alpha stage\
  \ as well as taking a look at some of the brand new content. In this preview, we\
  \ are taking a look at some of the changes between the Alpha release 3 and the Beta\
  \ Playtest Edition.\n   <p></p> \n   <p><b>Class Changes:</b> A number of classes\
  \ received a host of tweaks and changes based off playtester feedback. Here is just\
  \ a taste of what you can expect to find. Barbarian mighty rage got a little bit\
  \ cheaper to maintain (going from 4 points per round to 3). Cleric domains and wizard\
  \ schools now grant bonus spells instead of spell-like abilities (although they\
  \ maintain their supernatural abilities). Bardic performance DCs are now based off\
  \ the bard's level, not his Perform skill check. Rangers now grant their favored\
  \ enemy bonus to their animal companion, if they have one. Sorcerer bloodlines got\
  \ a few refinements, such as Intimidate being changed to Knowledge (planes) for\
  \ Abyssal sorcerers.</p> \n   <p><b>Combat Feats:</b> Combat feats, as you might\
  \ know them from Alpha release 3, are a thing of the past. Now the term refers to\
  \ any feat that can be selected as a fighter bonus feat. Of course, most of the\
  \ great combat feats have been retooled to fit with this change. Some feats even\
  \ got an upgrade, such as Dodge (whose bonus now increases to +2 if you have 10\
  \ or more ranks in Acrobatics) and Arcane Strike (whose bonus increases by +1 for\
  \ every five caster levels you possess).</p> \n   <p><b>Spells:</b> Wizard arcane\
  \ schools got revised for the Beta. The big change here is that wizards now choose\
  \ the spells that they gain upon reaching 2nd, 4th, 6th, 10th, 12th, 14th, 16th,\
  \ and 18th levels. These spells must be from their school and are set once selected.\
  \ It should be noted again that these spells now act as bonus spells, not spell-like\
  \ abilities. This change does not affect the supernatural abilities granted by arcane\
  \ schools.</p> \n   <p><b>Other Rules:</b> There are dozens of other small changes\
  \ to the rules as well. Favored Classes now grant a bonus hit point or a bonus skill\
  \ point. Recharging staves now only uses up the highest-level spell slot used by\
  \ the staff. Cover rules were simplified into something that is quite a bit easier\
  \ to adjust. Nearly every chapter received numerous changes based off your feedback\
  \ and comments.</p> \n   <p>You will be able to grab the Beta Playtest Edition as\
  \ a free PDF here at paizo.com or as a soft-cover, 408 page, full-color book. The\
  \ book will be on sale at Gen Con, through our web store, and from your favorite\
  \ local game store. Check back next week for a look at some of the new rules you'll\
  \ find in the Beta.</p> \n   <p> Jason Bulmahn <br> Lead Designer</p> \n  </blockquote>\
