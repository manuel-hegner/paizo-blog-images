  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"> \n    <p class=\"date\">Thursday, October\
  \ 12, 2017</p> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\"><i>Sometimes we like to give you\
  \ nice folks a window into the strange ways that Lone Shark and Paizo do things\
  \ on the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game. Here's Chad on our patently rigorous standards\
  \ for naming cards.</i></p> \n    <p>Way back when, we set out to make an adventure\
  \ card game for the glorious world of Pathfinder. Our friends at Paizo had just\
  \ the right Adventure Path in mind: <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/riseOfTheRunelords\"\
  >Rise of the Runelords</a> was being prepped for the <a href=\"/products/btpy8tc0?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-Rise-of-the-Runelords-Anniversary-Edition\"\
  ><em>Anniversary Edition</em></a>. The developers had taken a fresh look at the\
  \ story, the art was getting refreshed and expanded, and the publisher likes it\
  \ when products lined up nicely. We—Lone Shark and Paizo both—set up a giant playtest,\
  \ the results of which included \"huge mounds of feedback\" and \"Vic learning more\
  \ about various local FedEx policies and peccadilloes than any human should.\" Everything\
  \ looked great, <i>but...</i></p> \n    <p>While we were busily putting together\
  \ the game system, the characters, the Adventure Path, <i>and</i> the giant box\
  \ and tray, that still didn't cover everything. We still needed some introductory\
  \ material—something to go into the base box alongside the first adventure. And\
  \ because we knew that the second adventure was going to arrive two months after\
  \ the first, we thought there was a decent chance that people would play the introduction\
  \ more than once. (In this, we were both right and very wrong.) We talked to Paizo\
  \ to see if they had any suggestions, and eventually settled on a few varied scenarios\
  \ around Sandpoint. We conscripted the dragon Black Fang from an encounter in the\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy8osv?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Beginner-Box\"><em>Pathfinder\
  \ RPG Beginner Box</em></a>, and from the Sandpoint appendix in Rise of the Runelords,\
  \ we took the alchemist Pillbug Podiker and the handsome bandit leader Jubrayl Vhiski.</p>\

  ></a> \n     <p>These names were obvious.</p>\n    </div> \n    <p>Thus armed with\
  \ a cadre of ne'er's-do-well (I'm pretty sure that's the correct pluralization),\
  \ we set about building some relatively simple scenarios around them. Black Fang\
  \ got himself an eponymous Dungeon, Pillbug the poisoner gave us The Poison Pill,\
  \ and Vhiski... Hmm.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-JubraylVhiski.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-JubraylVhiski_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n     <p>The man with no scenario name.</p>\n    </div> \n    <p>As it turns\
  \ out, I've heard at least three versions of this next part. Most agree that it\
  \ was late, at the end of a long day. We were all sitting around a table, or a couple\
  \ tables. There's always at least one laptop; sometimes next to piles of rough-cut\
  \ cardstock, other times next to small fortress-walls made of <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lgbp?Skull-Shackles-All-Aboard-for-Adventure#29\"\
  ><del>Gary's</del></a> <i>Gaby's</i> mostly-empty beverage containers. We're always\
  \ tired. Someone always says \"I dunno; just give it a name, and we'll figure it\
  \ out later.\" Then someone says some version of \"I got it\" and types into a spreadsheet\
  \ cell. Often someone looks at the spreadsheet and proclaims it perfect, done, finished,\
  \ \"Ship it!\"—sometimes it's even the same person who entered it into the cell.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Now, something that you might not know, but probably could have guessed,\
  \ is that both Lone Shark and Paizo always do a review pass on the material, just\
  \ to make sure that everything lines up right—that the art matches the concept matches\
  \ the name matches the world. Sometimes we catch things like \"That is clearly not\
  \ an Elf,\" so we change a trait. Other times, we've used a name that might be technically\
  \ correct but just doesn't sound right—\"Force Pike\" is a perfectly reasonable\
  \ Pathfinder weapon that will just <i>not sound right</i> to a huge number of people.\
  \ And sometimes, the Lone Shark tendency to <del>sneak</del> <i>perfectly innocently\
  \ insert</i> puns into the game runs afoul of Standards and Practices. For example...</p>\

  ></a> \n     <p>Not the name his mom gave him.</p>\n    </div> \n    <p><i>Mike\
  \ here, rudely interrupting Chad's soliloquy. Now, just look up there and you'll\
  \ see: that is one handsome fellow. When we were thinking of dreamy chaps in old-timey\
  \ naval garb for Skull &amp; Shackles, one image came to mind: Benedict Cumberbatch\
  \ in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Horatio-Hornblower-Collectors-Edition/dp/B004G8N9VO\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">the BBC production of </a></i><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Horatio-Hornblower-Collectors-Edition/dp/B004G8N9VO\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Horatio Hornblower<i></i></a><i>. So we wrote an art description\
  \ asking for Cumberbatch in a faux–British naval uniform, just like he wore in that\
  \ series. But we couldn't just name him \"Benedict Cumberbatch,\" so we hopped over\
  \ to the YouTube series How to Pronounce, which will teach you many things (but\
  \ not how to correctly pronounce anything). <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxEA5UFpTGw\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">The entry for Benedict Cumberbatch</a> pronounces his name \"\
  Bucket Crunderdunder\" (among other things). So that's what we named him. Of course,\
  \ Vic caught wise to us and made us change that ridiculous name to something less\
  \ ridiculous, so Heartbreak Hinsin was born. There's only one problem with this\
  \ story: Benedict Cumberbatch was never actually in <i>Horatio Hornblower</i>—it\
  \ was Ioan Gruffudd. So we based an ally on a mispronunciation of a mistake. Par\
  \ for the course round the Lone Shark offices. OK, back to Chad.</i></p> \n    <p>In\
  \ the case of the first base scenario for Runelords, the name Mike chose was in\
  \ danger of running into this particular filter.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ </div> \n    <p>Brigandoom! It's like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qpk9JNUDr9k\"\
  ><em>Brigadoon</em></a> but with brigands! How droll!</p> \n    <p>Thing was, \"\
  Standards and Practices\" (in this case, Paizo's development staff) had noticed\
  \ our \"clever\" name, and flagged it for review. The jig was up, we thought. We'd\
  \ have to abandon our fun name and come up with something else. Given how late we\
  \ were in the process, we were starting to resign ourselves to a plain, boring name,\
  \ when someone else spoke up; the Chief Creative Officer and Publisher, in fact.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Far be it from me to stand between a man and his pun,\" Erik Mona said,\
  \ and cleared the flag.</p> \n    <p>And we love him for it to this day.</p> \n\
