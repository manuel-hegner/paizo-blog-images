  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Any adventurer\
  \ can swing a blade, but it takes planning and training to fell the greatest beasts.\
  \ Today we're sitting in on a crash course on monster hunting to show off some of\
  \ the new <a href=\"/products/btpy9s7z?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Monster-Hunters-Handbook\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Player Companion: Monster Hunter's Handbook</em></a>!</p> \n   \
  \ <p>\"You want to fight monsters, eh? You? The lot of you are scrawny, sickly,\
  \ sorry excuses for adventurers whose heads are more likely to be appearing as goblin\
  \ chamber pots a month from now than the polite side of a commemorative coin. If\
  \ you were serious about this business, you'd have signed on with real talent, like\
  \ the Duskwardens, the Mendevian Crusaders, or hell, even the Pathfinder Society.\
  \ See that lady in the heavy armor over there? She's a Hellknight in the Order of\
  \ the Pike—all dedicated to killing monsters and just shrugging off punishment.\
  \ That spear isn't to keep fiends at a safe distance; she's more dangerous the closer\
  \ you get, so her killing something with a reach weapon's a professional courtesy!\
  \ Nah, I figure if you're training with me, you're either rejects... or you want\
  \ the real secrets to slayin' beasts.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n  \

  Normally I teach a six-week course, but I can tell from the burning village over\
  \ there that some of you are in a rush to get back and defend your farms from whatever\
  \ crawled out of your great-grandma's crypt. Lemme boil the profession down into\
  \ four easy steps: identify, approach, kill, and repurpose. Master those, and you\
  \ have a long and fruitful career ahead of you of sleeping in the rain, crawling\
  \ through mud, reading scat, skinning beasts, and getting paid handsome purses of\
  \ gold for your trouble! Now... 'scuse me as I gather a few educational illustrations.\"\

  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderPlayerCompanion/PZO9478-Owlbear_500.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n     <p><i>Illustration by Forrest Imel</i></p> \n    </div> \n    <h3>Identify</h3>\
  \ \n    <p>\"If you don't know what you're up against, you're going to die. There,\
  \ I said it. Now see this? The first key to monster-hunting is knowing what in the\
  \ Abyss you're even hunting and how to identify it. As you can see here, Lirianne\
  \ and Ezren are in for a brutal surprise because they believe owlbears are a form\
  \ of caterpillar that dwells in the leaf litter. Rookie mistake.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Some hunters can't tell the difference between a centaur and a centipede, much less\
  \ between boggard and a boggart. The easiest solution is to team up with someone\
  \ who knows what's what and can spot it coming from a mile away. Rangers and inquisitors\
  \ are great for that—first one can forage a mean stew, besides, and the second can\
  \ practically smell monsters... uncanny. As an added bonus, think of these friends\
  \ as an early warning system; if he gets snatched up by a dinosaur and screams,\
  \ ‘Oh sweet Erastil, I'm being eaten by an allosaurus,\" chances are good there\
  \ might be a dangerous predator nearby. Be sure to ask him about any special weaknesses\
  \ the beast might have before he gets eaten.\"</p> \n    <p><b>Developers' Note</b>:\
  \ Been failing a lot of Perception checks? Maybe the abolisher inquisitor archetype's\
  \ ability to pierce disguises is for you. Don't forget new feats like Monster Spotter\
  \ and Needle in a Haystack to trace a monster to its lair and get the jump on it.</p>\
  \ \n    <h3>Approach</h3> \n    <p>\"Right, so you know what you're after? Great.\
  \ Monsters are canny scoundrels that have more senses than you have years of remaining\
  \ life expectancy. The moment they notice you coming is the moment they flap off\
  \ screaming, gather their friends, and choose a home ground advantage that going\
  \ to be a real pain to navigate. Ideally, you're going to sneak in and snap the\
  \ beast's neck, but looking at you, I'm guessing it's better to have some contingencies\
  \ for approaching the creature's lair like magical flight, invisibility, teleportation,\
  \ or, y'know, rope. But let's be clear: that's the old way of doing things. ‘Round\
  \ here we've mastered a new technique called Monstrous Masquerade. Allow me to show\
  \ off our winter collection:\"</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\
  //static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderPlayerCompanion/PZO9478-Amiri.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderPlayerCompanion/PZO9478-Amiri_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n     <p><i>Illustration by Kent Hamilton</i></p> \n    </div> \n    <p>\"\
  Amiri is wearing triple-ply yeti hide harvested just this morning, as designed by\
  \ the eminent Cronarg the Obliterator. Accessories include cold resistance, climb\
  \ speed, and a sinister sense of recycling for a good cause—all for the low cost\
  \ of a couple feats and some spare gold. Never underestimate the power of dressing\
  \ like your enemy in order to get the drop on your enemy. So Amiri, how do you like\
  \ the outfit?\"</p> \n    <p>\"MNYARRR! I'M A YETI!\"</p> \n    <p>\"Umm, of course\
  \ you are. As I'm sure Amiri meant to say, taking a few ranks in Disguise and learning\
  \ to speak Aklo can play a big role in the success of your disguise.\"</p> \n  \
  \  <p><b>Developers' Note</b>: New feats like Monstrous Disguise and Monstrous Masquerade\
  \ allow you not only to disguise yourself as monstrous humanoids but also to replicate\
  \ some of their abilities—flight speed, energy resistances, and more!</p> \n   \
  \ <h3>Kill</h3> \n    <p>\"Ah, the sweet song of steel ringing against a creature's\
  \ scales... it's that cheerful reminder that brute force isn't always enough to\
  \ cut through a gorgon's hide. You can't just hit everything with an axe until it\
  \ stops moving—okay you can't always hit things with axes. Sometimes you need to\
  \ apply some finesse. That's especially true if you're trying to make a living off\
  \ of monster hunting. See those bounty posters? See how the monsters have faces?\
  \ If you can't kill a monster without saving some recognizable piece to collect\
  \ the bounty, you're never gonna get paid.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderPlayerCompanion/PZO9478-Crowe.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderPlayerCompanion/PZO9478-Crowe_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n     <p><i>Illustration by Kent Hamilton</i></p> \n    </div> \n    <p>\"\
  Case in point: See Crowe here? He was sent to kill a bugbear chief, but he's gotten\
  \ a little carried away with the slaying part and now doesn't have any monster parts.\
  \ If he knew a bit more about goblinoid's he'd have a much cleaner kill and much\
  \ cleaner boots. Rookie mistake.\"</p> \n    <p><b>Developers' Note</b>: There are\
  \ some intense options for monster slaying in here. If you're a fan of the ranger's\
  \ favored enemy ability, you're going to love the Creature Focus feat, which provides\
  \ you some similar benefits; the Focused [your most hated creature type] Expertise\
  \ feats then build off that or the favored enemy ability, allowing you to apply\
  \ that favored enemy bonus on other checks and saving throws your targets love to\
  \ use. Another favorite is the green scourge druid archetype, which allows you to\
  \ prepare flame blade and shillelagh using higher spell slots in order to grant\
  \ the manifested weapon magical properties.</p> \n    <p>Also yes, we know that's\
  \ a lemure. We've just seen Crowe in action and know he tends to reduce most foes\
  \ to piles of glop.</p> \n    <h3>Repurpose</h3> \n    <p>\"So let's make an assumption:\
  \ let's say you prevailed, and the creature's dead at your feet. An amateur is going\
  \ to lop of the beast's head, heave it before the constable, and get paid. A real\
  \ pro doesn't let a good carcass go to waste! Scales, teeth, horns, eyeballs...\
  \ it's all an organic treasure trove just waiting for some enterprising spirit with\
  \ a carving knife and a little know-how. Chances are that if it came from a powerful\
  \ monster, a wizard somewhere has developed a spell that uses it. Even if you don't\
  \ have any friends in the spellcasting business, you can turn spare pieces into\
  \ downright ferocious trophies and armor.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n\
  \     <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderPlayerCompanion/PZO9478-Mavaro.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderPlayerCompanion/PZO9478-Mavaro_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n     <p><i>Illustration by Kent Hamilton</i></p> \n    </div> \n    <p>\"\
  Any yokel with a sword and PC class levels can wear dragonhide; that doesn't take\
  \ any creativity. Talk to me when you've chased off a chimera by turning its cousin's\
  \ horns into a bullroarer or its teeth into a set of wind chimes. If you want to\
  \ identify a true master of the craft—like that one over there—watch for the weird\
  \ trophies. Nobody makes armor out wing membranes if he wants to deflect attacks;\
  \ he does it because he can kill any threat before it scratches him.\"</p> \n  \
  \  <p><b>Developers' Note</b>: That's right, there are rules for harvesting critter\
  \ parts and turning them into magic items and temporary trophies that can spook\
  \ similar kinds of creatures! If you think Mavaro's looking pretty dapper in his\
  \ variant red dragon hide armor and array of grisly trophies, take a look at the\
  \ psychodermist, an occultist archetype that swaps out conventional implements for\
  \ magically preserved pieces of creatures you've slain (and whose powers you can\
  \ channel)!</p> \n    <h3>Final Exam</h3> \n    <p>\"So what have we learned? Travel\
  \ with friends, learn what you're up against, kill efficiently, and let nothing\
  \ go to waste. Right, that's all the time we have. Grab your weapon of choice from\
  \ the corner, there, and go make a name for yourselves!\"</p> \n    <p><b>Developers'\
