  \ massively multiplayer online roleplaying game. When the aristocratic Vishov family\
  \ has been banished from Ustalav due to underhanded politics, Lady Tyressa Vishov\
  \ is faced with a choice: fade slowly into obscurity, or strike out for the nearby\
  \ River Kingdoms and establish a new holding on the untamed frontier. Together with\
  \ her children and loyal retainers, she’ll forge a new life in the infamous Echo\
  \ Wood, and neither bloodthirsty monsters nor local despots will stop her from reclaiming\
  \ her family honor. Yet the shadow of Ustalavic politics is long, and even in a\
  \ remote and lawless territory, there may be those determined to see the Vishov\
  \ family fail...</span></p>\n             <blockquote>\n              <h1 style=\"\
  text-align: center;\">Chapter Thirteen</h1>\n              <h2 style=\"text-align:\
  \ center;\">A Dream Uprooted</h2>\n              <p>Jerrad couldn't tell from which\
  \ direction the scream had come. He'd been huddled beneath a blanket reading the\
  \ wizardry text. Something about the words didn't require light for him to read—\
  which made sense. Many of the spells were centered around illusions and projecting\
  \ images into a subject's mind. The whole book, he decided, was primarily a practical\
  \ text on illusion, and he devoured each lesson as the book choose to reveal it\
  \ to him.</p>\n              <p><em>Don</em>'<em>t move</em>. He closed the book\
  \ and trembled. <em>Someone just had an accident. It can</em>'<em>t be anything\
  \ bad. Just stay here.</em></p>\n              <p>Someone else screamed.</p>\n \
  \             <p><em>Serra!</em></p>\n              <p>He threw off the blanket.\
  \ Silhouettes ran through the night—some normal people and some small, like children,\
  \ but with enormous heads and ridiculously large ears. He resisted the urge to duck\
  \ beneath the blankets again, and instead cupped his hands around his mouth. \"\
  Goblins!\"</p>\n              <p>Jerrad grabbed his belt and fumbled with the buckle\
  \ for a heartbeat or two before realizing he didn't need to wear the belt. His hand\
  \ drifted down to the dagger, and he drew it just in time for one of the goblins\
  \ to bound into his tent, peg teeth flashing.</p>\n              <p>Time died. The\
  \ goblin had daubed its face with reddish mud and some yellow paste probably made\
  \ from flowers. It had tied feathers to its biceps and just below the knees. A mangy\
  \ skin made up its loincloth and the short cloak it wore. It had a rusty knife tucked\
  \ into a slender belt, but never made to draw it.</p>\n              <p>The goblin\
  \ hissed and leaped for him. Clawed hands reached for Jerrad's throat. The young\
  \ man thrust the dagger forward—less as an attack than an attempt to fend the goblin\
  \ off. His dagger plunged into the goblin's throat right above a necklace of bones.\
  \ Hot blood shot up Jerrad's sleeve, and the goblin's dying spin tore the slicked\
  \ knife from his hand. The creature stumbled and fell against Jerrad's cot.</p>\n\
  \              <p>The goblin's claws rent the pillow asunder, then the creature\
  \ slumped amid a blizzard of feathers. It sighed as if settling down for a welcome\
  \ nap.</p>\n              <p>Jerrad stared at his gore-drenched hand. A feather\
  \ landed on it, drinking in the goblin's blood. <em>What have I done?</em></p>\n\
  \              <p>Then he heard another scream. <em>Serra! I have to find Serra!</em>\
  \ He dropped to a knee and yanked the dagger from the goblin's throat. Trailing\
  \ feathers in his wake, he ran into the night, and heard her scream a third time.</p>\n\
  \              <p><em>There!</em></p>\n              <p>Serrana ran pell-mell through\
  \ the camp in a panic. She headed mostly west, angling toward the furthest of the\
  \ root cellars. He raced after her, slashing goblins and pushing them out of the\
  \ way. He didn't hurt many, but caught a couple solidly. They'd either not seen\
  \ him coming or didn't care as long as there was loot to carry off. Odd, capering\
  \ victory dances took precedence over fighting, adding absurdity to the night's\
  \ horrific chaos.</p>\n              <p>Ahead, his sister tripped and fell against\
  \ a pile of wood scraps. Three goblins moved at her. Two had knives.</p>\n     \
  \         <p>\"Hey!\" Jerrad thrust his left hand high in the air as the goblins\
  \ stared at him. <em>This better work!</em></p>\n              <p>He cast the spell\
  \ he'd been trying to perfect beneath the blanket. A brilliant light flared from\
  \ his hand, rendering the goblins in silver and his sister in icy blue. One goblin\
  \ screamed, dropping his knife, and clawed at his own eyes.</p>\n              <p>As\
  \ darkness returned and a wave of fatigue washed over him, Jerrad let his run carry\
  \ him into the nearest goblin. He bowled the creature over. His foe sank teeth into\
  \ Jerrad's left shoulder, but the boy barely noticed. Hand tight on the dagger's\
  \ sticky hilt, Jerrad stabbed again and again. His thrusts ruined the goblin's belly,\
  \ but he didn't stop stabbing until the jaws slackened.</p>\n              <p>He\
  \ pitched the body off and rose, blood coursing down his arm and dripping from the\
  \ blade. He gave Serra a smile. \"It's okay.\"</p>\n              <p>Her eyes grew\
  \ wide and her voice rose with fear. \"Jerrad, look out!\"</p>\n              <p>He\
  \ spun right into an avalanche of goblins. His knife sank into something solid and\
  \ warm, but it didn't matter. A skull clipped his jaw, cracking teeth together.\
  \ With horror contorting Serra's face, Jerrad sank beneath a wave of rending claws,\
  \ biting teeth, and goblin flesh.</p>\n              <p style=\"text-align: center;\"\
  >∗ ∗ ∗</p>\n              <p>Tyressa leaped from the battlements and landed in a\
  \ crouch. She gathered her skirts and pulled the rear hem up between her legs, tucked\
  \ it into her belt at the belly. Cool air chilled bare feet. Another two steps and\
  \ she picked up a stout stick. Two more and she levered a hatchet free of the chopping\
  \ block where they killed chickens. With one stroke she slashed the stick into a\
  \ sharpened stake, then stalked into the night.</p>\n              <p>More screams\
  \ drew her onward. She heard someone yell \"Goblins!\" and thought it might be Jerrad.\
  \ <em>At least he</em>'s alive. She killed the urge to run to him. Panic would slay\
  \ her, and then she'd be no help to anyone.</p>\n              <p>The first goblin\
  \ flew at her out of the darkness, screeching as it came. Tyressa twisted, thrusting\
  \ with her left hand. The stake caught the goblin in the chest, but a skin vest\
  \ prevented it from penetrating. The creature giggled at its good fortune, then\
  \ grew quiet as an overhand blow with the hatchet split its skull.</p>\n       \
  \       <p>Off to the right, one of the woodsmen cleaved a goblin in half.</p>\n\
  \              <p>\"To me!\"</p>\n              <p>The man looked up as she wrenched\
  \ the hatchet from the skull, then ran to her, nodding as he came. \"Goblins.\"\
  </p>\n              <p>\"I see. I'd prefer highwaymen.\"</p>\n              <p>\"\
  My lady?\"</p>\n              <p>\"Bigger targets, and they don't bite.\" She raised\
  \ her voice. \"To me, Silverlake!\"</p>\n              <p>Tyressa had meant the\
  \ call to draw the settlers to her. A few came, one with an arm hanging limp and\
  \ blood pouring from his shoulder. More quickly, however, came the goblins, chittering\
  \ and gibbering, snarling and giggling insanely.</p>\n              <p>Off to the\
  \ north one section of the wall ignited in a wash of flames. Goblin silhouettes\
  \ writhed across the landscape. They piled up against the longhouse, standing on\
  \ each other to get in the windows. Knives cut some, broomsticks thrust others away.\
  \ Yet more ran around carrying off even the most inconsequential of trinkets. One\
  \ had even slapped a boot on its head, lacing the floppy helmet on beneath the chin.</p>\n\
  \              <p>All this Tyressa took in with emotionless clarity. She didn't\
  \ even allow herself anger, because letting in one emotion would open the way for\
  \ others. She thrust and cut within her guard, remaining safe as her husband had\
  \ taught her to do, yet missed no opportunity to kill. The hatchet's dull end pulverized\
  \ what the blade wouldn't slice. A slap with the flat shattered bone. Goblins reeled\
  \ away trying to press their faces back into shape.</p>\n              <p>The wounded\
  \ man went down, and the goblins dragged him away. Tyressa closed ranks with the\
  \ others. More goblins came in a wave that broke against the ferocity of the settlers'\
  \ defense. Blood splashed. Sweat stung the countless scratches on her legs and forearms.\
  \ Bones snapped. They weren't hers, but one solid hatchet stroke sent a shock wave\
  \ up into her shoulder, and the dying goblin carried the hatchet away with it.</p>\n\
  \              <div class=\"blurb360\">\n               <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8521-LadyTyressa.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8521-LadyTyressa_360.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \               <br>\n                Lady Tyressa understands that a true leader\
  \ leads \n               <br>\n                from the front lines.\n         \
  \     </div>\n              <p>\"They're running, my lady.\"</p>\n             \
  \ <p>The woodsman was right. <em>But that</em>'<em>s </em>not<em> right. </em>Tyressa\
  \ frowned, wiping her brow and smearing blood across it. The goblins <em>had </em>thinned,\
  \ scattering in all directions, but more were upright than dead or dying. <em>Why\
  \ would they break off the attack?</em></p>\n              <p>Then she felt it,\
  \ through her feet. Tremors in the ground, matching heavy footfalls. Something crashed\
  \ through the darkness, coming up from the lake. She couldn't tell what it was,\
  \ other than big. Whatever it was, the goblins knew better than to be anywhere near\
  \ it. And she'd have followed their example, except that she wasn't going to let\
  \ anything drive her from her home.</p>\n              <p style=\"text-align: center;\"\
  >∗ ∗ ∗</p>\n              <p>Welinn huddled just inside the southernmost portion\
  \ of the wall, cloaked darkness. He could see plenty well through it, as could all\
  \ the goblins. The problem was, he couldn't see anything <em>but</em> goblins. Attacking,\
  \ looting, setting fires, dying, all he saw were goblins by the legion.</p>\n  \
  \            <p>That wasn't the way it was supposed to have worked. He, being of\
  \ the Brambleclaw Tribe, had gotten the blessing of his chief, then gathered a company\
  \ of goblins. He'd told them all the things the manlord wanted, especially about\
  \ the scaring and the girl. The scaring would be what earned him extra money, so\
  \ he had stressed it to his fellows.</p>\n              <p>He'd had a special thought\
  \ in that regard. The manlord had wanted the attack to come on the moonless night,\
  \ but that made no real sense if scaring was the object. If men couldn't see the\
  \ goblins, how could they be scared? They couldn't, so the plan had to be modified\
  \ so there was enough light to allow the scaring.</p>\n              <p>The Brambleclaws\
  \ had taken the news about scaring to heart. More than one approached him asking\
  \ if they could invite a cousin, since more would be scarier than less. Welinn had\
  \ accepted the first few offers, then started refusing, but no one had listened\
  \ to him. Cousins had invited other cousins, and it looked as if every goblin between\
  \ Thornkeep and Silvershade Lake had joined in.</p>\n              <p>Then he saw\
  \ it. One of the goblins had gone to far with scaring. <em>He invited Grakka.</em></p>\n\
  \              <p>The creature looked like an ogre, but Welinn had heard it was\
  \ of mixed blood—human or elf, though looking at it the goblin couldn't have told\
  \ which. The ogrekin lived alone in the wood, having been driven from or escaped\
  \ from Mosswater. It came dragging the lower half of a sapling—complete with root\
  \ ball, as it stalked up the slope from the lake. The footfalls sounded as thunder\
  \ and the ground shook.</p>\n              <p><em>Too much scaring.</em> The goblin\
  \ made himself as small as possible. He waited for Grakka to pass, then Welinn snuck\
  \ around the corner and darted into the night.<em> </em>It didn't matter how much\
  \ gold money the manlord would give him, it wouldn't be enough to lurk within the\
  \ ogrekin's bloody domain.</p>\n              <p style=\"text-align: center;\">∗\
  \ ∗ ∗</p>\n              <p>Jerrad rolled and tried to heave a goblin off him. He\
  \ might have succeeded, he didn't know. His push included his knife, but he didn't\
  \ hear a grunt or scream. Then again, being at the heart of a ball of yowling, gouging,\
  \ gnawing goblins meant he couldn't make sense of much at all.</p>\n           \
  \   <p><em>I have to get free</em>. He fought panic and bit. He drove his knees\
  \ into things. He smashed his head backward into something which crunched. His left\
  \ elbow slammed against hardness, and his left hand closed on something squishy.\
  \ He yanked. That got a howl, then teeth closed on his right wrist and his knife\
  \ went flying.</p>\n              <p>He lashed out with everything he had, but the\
  \ goblins weighed him down. Any time he sent one flying, two more would pile on.\
  \ He couldn't get a decent breath. And something had a hand on the side of his head,\
  \ trying to work his head up to expose his throat. He fought it. Claws sank into\
  \ his scalp. Blood ran. The grip slipped for a second, then moved down and hooked\
  \ beneath his jaw.</p>\n              <p>Then it was gone. Something hit with a\
  \ solid thunk, and that goblin vanished. Then another thump, and another. Weight\
  \ left his legs, so he kicked. He arched his back, then twisted, trying to get his\
  \ hands under him.</p>\n              <p>Another thump, and more weight evaporated.</p>\n\
  \              <p>And then he heard her voice. \"Get. Off. Mouse!\"</p>\n      \
  \        <p>Jerrad wriggled from the pile. As he stood, two goblins came for him.\
  \ An arrow splashed back to front through the throat of the furthest, then struck\
  \ the other in the back of the head. The razored broadhead skewered the left eyeball\
  \ on its way out. The goblin stiffened, viscous fluid streaming down its face, then\
  \ flopped to the ground.</p>\n              <p>Beyond it stood Kiiryth, another\
  \ arrow already fitted to his bow. He gave Jerrad a nod, then turned and sped another\
  \ shaft into the night.</p>\n              <p>Between them stood Serrana, a four-foot\
  \ length of pine sapling clenched tight in her fists. She whipped it up and around,\
  \ spraying blood and goblin brains all over, then crashed it down. The blow pulped\
  \ a goblin's bulbous head. The club rose again and struck the same goblin.</p>\n\
  \              <p>\"Serra. <em>Serrana</em>!\"</p>\n              <p>She looked\
  \ up at him, feral fire burning in her eyes. Lips peeled back in a snarl. She flashed\
  \ a grin, then whirled and battered another dead goblin's skull into wet mush. \"\
  Get. Off. Mouse!\"</p>\n              <p>\"Serrana, its okay, they're off me.\"\
  </p>\n              <p>His sister stopped for a moment, a thick, dark slurry running\
  \ down over her hands. \"Mouse?\"</p>\n              <p>\"Yes, Serrana. You saved\
  \ me.\"</p>\n              <p>\"I saved you.\"</p>\n              <p>Kiiryth closed\
  \ with both of them. \"There are more to save. To the longhouse, now.\"</p>\n  \
  \            <p style=\"text-align: center;\">∗ ∗ ∗</p>\n              <p>Maraschal\
  \ Sunnock stood alone in the chaos within the longhouse. He'd gone there to give\
  \ some last-minute orders to his servants concerning the next day's journey. He'd\
  \ heard the scream and seen forms running through the night before someone had closed\
  \ and barred the door. And even when a goblin thrust its face through a window,\
  \ he still couldn't believe it.</p>\n              <p><em>This is wrong, all wrong!</em>\
  \ His mouth went dry. <em>I wasn't supposed to be here.</em></p>\n             \
  \ <p>\"You, help us!\"</p>\n              <p>Sunnock looked up. One of the woodsmen\
  \ had joined two other men at the door, pushing back against a horde of goblins.\
  \ Boards began to creak. Nails squealed and worked free of the wood. The man waved\
  \ him forward and, dazed by disbelief, Sunnock joined him.</p>\n              <p>The\
  \ second his hands touched the door's wood, fear burst within his heart. Until that\
  \ moment, the attack had been an abstract thing. Here, leveraging his muscle against\
  \ that of the goblins, he could feel their insistence. They were avatars of gluttony\
  \ and hatred and greed. A knot in a board popped free, striking him in the face.\
  \ He stared out through it, eye to eye with a goblin.</p>\n              <p>Sunnock\
  \ spun, slamming his back against the door. People warded every window, stabbing\
  \ and battering goblins, shoving them back into the night. But there, toward the\
  \ center, children huddled with older folks. Faces ashen with fear, they looked\
  \ toward him. His presence gave them hope. They counted on him. He was their salvation.</p>\n\
  \              <p>For a heartbeat before he realized the pressure on the door had\
  \ slackened, Sunnock felt like a hero. He understood that all the gold in the world\
  \ couldn't buy the sensation of having someone look upon you with gratitude for\
  \ saving her life. He was all that stood between them and the end of everything.\
  \ His selflessness would live on forever.</p>\n              <p>And it was that\
  \ thought, as yet untainted by wondering how he could turn that gratitude to his\
  \ own advantage, which occupied his mind the very moment the massive root ball exploded\
  \ the door. Sharp oaken splinters pierced him through and through. A heavy board\
  \ crushed his skull. His lifeless body flew into the room, bouncing and rolling\
  \ to the edge of the circle of people he had saved.</p>\n              <p>He never\
  \ heard the terrified screams attesting to his failure.</p>\n              <p style=\"\
  text-align: center;\">∗ ∗ ∗</p>\n              <p>Jerrad arrived at the longhouse's\
  \ far end just as the huge, ugly beast struck his first blow. Wood shattered. What\
  \ had once been the door was now a jagged hole. People screamed from beyond it.</p>\n\
  \              <p>Jerrad choked down fear. \"What is that?\"</p>\n             \
  \ <p>\"Some unholy creature gotten on someone by an ogre.\" The archer's eyes narrowed.\
  \ \"Not full-blooded—usually called ogrekin—but just as nasty as the purebreds.\"\
  </p>\n              <p>The ogrekin tugged its club free. Eight feet tall, with flesh\
  \ the color of a bruised mushroom, the creature bulged with muscle. The sheer power\
  \ it could generate was terrifying enough, but its face could only be described\
  \ as blasphemous. One pointed ear sat lower than the other, and the pale blue eye\
  \ on the left had to be three times the diameter of the brown one on the right.\
  \ Yellow teeth were jumbled in a jaw that gaped open, and the nose had been broken\
  \ so many times Jerrad had to cant his head to make the nostrils line up right.</p>\n\
  \              <p>Kiiryth's bow came up. The bowstring twanged as he loosed an arrow.\
  \ It pierced the monster's left shoulder, the broadhead emerging out the back. Blood\
  \ ran in rivulets down the arm and dripped from the arrow's tip.</p>\n         \
  \     <p>The ogrekin didn't give the wound so much as a glance.</p>\n          \
  \    <p>Tyressa, butcher knife in one hand and fishing spear in the other, appeared\
  \ and whistled loudly. \"You're not welcome in my town.\"</p>\n              <p><em>Mother!</em>\
  \ Jerrad started toward her, but Kiiryth grabbed his collar and held him back.</p>\n\
  \              <p>\"You'd only slow her down.\"</p>\n              <p>The behemoth\
  \ looked at her. Contempt further warped its face. It snarled, flashing a tangle\
  \ of uneven teeth. The ogrekin reached for her with its left hand.</p>\n       \
  \       <p>Tyressa ducked beneath the attempted grab and circled around toward the\
  \ monster's back. It turned to keep with her, but its grip on the club slowed it.\
  \ By the time the ogrekin had pulled the club from the longhouse, Tyressa had darted\
  \ in and slashed the thing's right heel. Black blood sprayed from a deep cut over\
  \ the tendon.</p>\n              <p>Tyressa danced wide, carrying her outside the\
  \ range of the ogrekin's swinging club. The club came around and slammed into the\
  \ longhouse's wall. It splintered boards and snapped the corner post. The longhouse\
  \ shifted, the wood closing like jaws on the club, clinging to it with a fierce\
  \ tenacity.</p>\n              <p>The ogrekin snarled and set itself, muscles bunching\
  \ in shoulders and back. The monster heaved, trying to free the weapon. Wood groaned.\
  \ Some nails squeaked as they came free, but the building didn't release the club\
  \ on that first attempt. So the behemoth planted its feet and hauled back for all\
  \ it was worth.</p>\n              <p>The damaged tendon popped. The creature's\
  \ right foot slid out from under it. The ogre landed hard on the base of its spine.\
  \ The tremor rattled teeth in Jerrad's head. The monster threw its head back and\
  \ howled in pain.</p>\n              <p>And a little bit in fear.</p>\n        \
  \      <p>The people of Silverlake boiled from the longhouse. Woodsmen chopped into\
  \ the ogre's shoulders and wrists. People stabbed it, using knives, scythes, and\
  \ even sharp sticks. Kiiryth shot arrows into any exposed flesh. Even Serrana charged\
  \ in, battering it with her blood-stained club.</p>\n              <p>But Tyressa\
  \ slew it. As others hacked at its limbs, Jerrad's mother leaped onto the ogre's\
  \ chest. The monster's head came up. It hissed a challenge. Tyressa roared back,\
  \ the stepped on its throat and thrust the fishing spear straight through the larger\
  \ eye.</p>\n              <p>The ogre thrashed, ripping the spear from her hand\
  \ and tossing her into the crowd. Its death throes crushed one man and broke several\
  \ others. The people withdrew, weapons ready, as the monster thrashed out the last\
  \ seconds of its life, then cheered as it lay still.</p>\n              <p>Tyressa\
  \ emerged from the bloodthirsty throng bruised but otherwise unhurt.</p>\n     \
  \         <p>Jerrad stared at her, and wasn't alone. <em>You</em>'<em>re my mother,\
  \ but </em>are<em> you my mother?</em></p>\n              <p>Tyressa bent, resting\
  \ hands on knees. She breathed heavily for a moment or two, then let her skirt hem\
  \ slip down and straightened up. She looked around, then nodded.</p>\n         \
  \     <p>\"This is a terrible night, but you've all done well. See to yourselves.\
  \ See to our wounded. Then we shall attend to our dead.\" She wiped her bloody hands\
  \ on her skirts. \"This is a night we mourn now, but shall celebrate in the future.\
  \ And because of you, Silverlake will <em>have</em> a future.\"</p>\n          \
