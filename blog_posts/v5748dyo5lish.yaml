  date\">Tuesday, May 10, 2016</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"> \n    <p>This\
  \ week is just a quick data dump ahead of Gen Con's <a href=\"https://www.gencon.com/event_finder\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">event registration on Sunday</a> to let you know what we've\
  \ got on tap for the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game at the show. I am both excited\
  \ and terrified to let you in on some secrets today.</p> \n    <h2>Pathfinder Adventure\
  \ Card Guild</h2> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">We've got tons of material on\
  \ tap for organized play fans at this year's show. First, the known info: Season\
  \ of the Runelords, our third season of the Adventure Card Guild, wraps up in August\
  \ 2016, and avid players will be able to triumphantly complete the season in the\
  \ Sagamore ballroom. You'll be able to play any or all of the scenarios in SotRu\
  \ at the show, and we'll even keep a copy or two of Season of the Righteous and\
  \ Season of the Shackles tucked away for folks who want to catch up or try some\
  \ new adventures.</p> \n    <p>We'll also be debuting a mini-season, affectionately\
  \ known in-house as WE BE CARD GOBLINS! This two-adventure \"seasonlet\" will take\
  \ players through a PACG adaptation of the events of the Free RPG Day adventures\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy8j5w\"><em>We Be Goblins</em></a> and <a href=\"/products/btpy8xc3\"\
  ><em>We Be Goblins Too!</em></a>. Birds will be crunched, toads will be licked,\
  \ and many, many things will be exploded. This mini-season will bridge the gap between\
  \ Season of the Runelords and Season of the Mummy, which will launch in October\
  \ when we release the <a href=\"/products/btpy9mbg\"><em>Mummy's Mask Base Set</em></a>.\
  \ I didn't get the We Be Card Goblins event listing to Gen Con on time <i>(Bad Tanis!)</i>,\
  \ so it's not listed in their event system—just buy a Season of the Runelords event\
  \ ticket and we'll form parties on the fly. (This seems like a good time to mention\
  \ that the <a href=\"/products/btpy9jcw\"><em>Goblins Fight!</em></a> and <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9k5m\"><em>Goblins Burn!</em></a> decks will be available for purchase\
  \ at the show.)</p> \n    <p>To bury the lede, I should mention that our promo goblins,\
  \ Ranzak, Ekkie, and Tup, will be PFACG-legal starting in August!</p> \n    <p>To\
  \ further bury the lede, I am thrilled to elaborate on a little nugget that Pathfinder\
  \ Society OPC Tonya Woldridge dropped in her <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lisd\"\
  >blog yesterday</a>:</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>This year's special, titled\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9mbe\"><em>#8-00: The Cosmic Captive</em></a> and authored\
  \ by Matt Duval, starts at 8:00 PM on Friday night. In past years, we ran 160 Roleplaying\
  \ Guild tables, spanning levels 1 through 11. This year, we are keeping 160 Roleplaying\
  \ Guild tables and adding 20 Adventure Card Guild tables. All 180 tables will work\
  \ together to achieve common goals, and the actions of one effect the outcomes of\
  \ others.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>You read that right: ACG and RPG tables\
  \ working together to [redacted] [redacted] the [redacted]! I could not be more\
  \ excited for this event. Working from Matt Duval's excellent adventure, the whole\
  \ PFS team will be coming together to craft an exciting interactive for the whole\
  \ PFS community. <em>The Cosmic Captive</em> will feature a mix of custom cards\
  \ and cards from various base sets, and the deck will (eventually) be available\
  \ for download or purchase if you want to run the event at your local convention.</p>\
  \ \n    <h2>ACG Open 2: Son of ACG Open</h2> \n    <p>In case that wasn't enough\
  \ <del>work for me</del> fun for you, we've also got a new Adventure Card Game Open\
  \ in store. See if team <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lhtk\">\"On the Dot\"</a>\
  \ can continue its reign, or maybe the upstart team \"Don't Trust Tanis\" will take\
  \ them out! Or maybe YOUR team of four will be the victors! The ACG Open is a team\
  \ vs. team advancement tournament played in 3 rounds. Quarterfinal matches will\
  \ happen Thursday and Friday, the semifinal rounds on Saturday, and a final on Sunday.\
  \ Last year's final was attended by most of the ACG design team and was quite exciting,\
  \ and the winners each got a full Adventure Card Game Base Set, Character Add-On\
  \ Deck, and Adventure Decks signed by the designers.</p> \n    <h2>But Wait! There's\
  \ More!</h2> \n    <p>Even though Mummy's Mask won't be out until October, we will\
  \ be running continuous MM demos at the Paizo booth during floor hours. Just show\
  \ up, take a seat, and try not to get cursed too badly. And don't miss the Pathfinder\
  \ Adventure Card Game seminar on Thursday at 2:00 PM—even <i>we</i> have no idea\
  \ what secrets we might reveal!</p> \n    <p>Our friends at Obsidian will also be\
  \ on hand to show off <a href=\"https://pathfinder.obsidian.net\" target=\"_blank\"\
  >Pathfinder Adventures</a>. I'm going to assume that if you're reading this blog\
  \ and you have an iPad or an Android tablet, you're already playing this digital\
  \ edition of the PACG, so all I need to tell you is that you'll have the opportunity\
  \ to ask the Obsidian crew what's coming up next. You'll also want to check out\
  \ the seminar \"Pathfinder &amp; Obsidian\" on Friday at 1:00 PM.</p> \n    <p>Come\
  \ join us at Gen Con for the Best Four Days in Gaming!</p> \n    <p>Tanis O'Connor<br>\
