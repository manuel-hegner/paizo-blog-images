  \ \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Space is big. Really, really big. Even Starfinder's\
  \ galaxy, one of trillions in the larger universe, is a vast expanse from a humanoid\
  \ perspective, and the best way to traverse these almost incomprehensible distances\
  \ is with a starship! Many starships are commercial workhorses, hauling cargo from\
  \ one world to another; other ships ferry passengers between pockets of civilization\
  \ in Near Space or the Vast; and some ships, bristling with armaments or packed\
  \ with troops, are weapons of war.</p> \n    <p>Launching out of spacedock this\
  \ month is <a href=\"/products/btq01wyc?Starfinder-FlipMat-Warship\"><em>Starfinder\
  \ Flip-Mat: Warship</em></a>, ready to land one of these intimidating military vessels\
  \ on your tabletop! Perfect for representing a cruiser, a battleship, or even a\
  \ dreadnought, <em>Starfinder Flip-Mat: Warship</em> presents two different miniatures-scale\
  \ maps: the ship's bridge and command-and-control center, and one of its gun decks,\
  \ complete with capital weapons!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a\

  \  <p>If interstellar war is not your style, there are plenty more <a href=\"/store/starfinder/maps\"\
  >Starfinder Flip-Mats</a> featuring less... aggressive... starships for your game.\
  \ When your heroes happen across a derelict ship tumbling through space, <a href=\"\
  /products/btpya1ag?Starfinder-FlipMat-Ghost-Ship\"><em>Starfinder Flip-Mat: Ghost\
  \ Ship</em></a> has you covered, with an abandoned tramp freighter on one side,\
  \ and a scientific research vessel that has clearly suffered some sort of outer\
  \ space calamity on the other.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\

  \ alt=\"Ghost Ship Flip-Mat sample, depicting a deserted tramp freighter\"></a>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>But Starfinder is a game of characters as well as starships,\
  \ and science-fantasy heroes need a ship of their own to ply the space lanes between\
  \ worlds. <a href=\"/products/btpy9x41?Starfinder-FlipMat-Starship\"><em>Starfinder\
  \ Flip-Mat: Starship</em></a> gives you two different starships, each suitable as\
  \ a mobile base of operations for player characters, whether they're piloting an\
  \ elegant exploration craft with two decks or a well-used working freighter with\
  \ plenty of cargo space. If your heroes are of a more martial bent, the freighter\
  \ can also double as a military dropship, its cargo holds ready to host platoons\
  \ of marines for invading hostile planets.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  /products/btpya1ac?Starfinder-FlipMat-Starship-The-Sunrise-Maiden\"><em>Starfinder\
  \ Flip-Mat: Starship, The Sunrise Maiden</em></a>, showcasing a ship familiar to\
  \ players of the <a href=\"/deadsuns\">Dead Suns Adventure Path</a>. Over the course\
  \ of the campaign, the Sunrise Maiden carries the heroes of Dead Suns from the civilized\
  \ Pact Worlds to the unexplored reaches of the Vast, but it can represent almost\
  \ any Medium starship used by player characters. This oversized Flip-Mat includes\
  \ maps of both the <em>Sunrise Maiden</em>'s interior compartments and a portion\
  \ of its exterior inside a docking bay.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n\
