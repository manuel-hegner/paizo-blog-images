  \ itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">Having run into\
  \ some friendly rangers, not-so-friendly rangers, downright unfriendly rangers,\
  \ and even an ex-ranger in the Hook Mountains, the party heads back down from the\
  \ mountain peak to the bucolic coastal city of Sandpoint for some much-needed rest\
  \ and relaxation. Just one problem: all the stone giants.</span></p> \n    <div\

  \ of Sandpoint are clearly no match for these giants, but we're sure you're up for\
  \ the challenge. While it might seem like the best way to beat a creature of great\
  \ size is with overwhelming numbers—and certainly neither an inspirational song\
  \ from Lem nor a helpful sword blow from Valeros would be refused!—canny giant-hunters\
  \ like Harsk can tell you all about the dangers of grouping up against giants. Much\
  \ better to find a good vantage point for a well-placed shot. The eyes, throat,\
  \ and knees are all excellent targets... if you can hit them.</p> \n    <p>But let's\
  \ back up a second (if we can afford a second) and find out what's going on here.</p>\

  ></a> \n     <br>Doesn't anyone STAY saved?\n    </div> \n    <p>While you were\
  \ up in the Hook Mountains ending Barl Breakbones' threat to the area (along with\
  \ his life), the giants apparently had plans of their own. The stone giant warlord\
  \ Teraktinus is leading a host of giants against the city, bombarding it with flung\
  \ boulders and literally tearing apart Sandpoint's walls, buildings, and citizens.\
  \ As you arrive, the siege is already underway, and the pressure is on. The giants'\
  \ apparent aim is to reduce the city to rubble, and you'll need to hurry if you\
  \ want to stop them and save Sandpoint. </p> \n    <p>Down here, tracking and sniping\
  \ giants is all well and good, but some people prefer to do their giant-slaying\
  \ up close and personal. For those people, we present the giantbane dagger. </p>\

  \ it's perfectly capable of stabbing goblins, humans, elves, ranger-wights, and\
  \ dragons, this little beauty prefers to dine on a steady stream of ogres, trolls,\
  \ ogrekin, and giants of all flavors. Err, kinds. As Ameiko's brother Tsuto once\
  \ said, \"The death of a thousand cuts need not require a thousand blades.\" Or,\
  \ as Merisiel often says, \"Mine!\"</p> \n    <p>Killing, stabbing, shooting, and\
  \ bashing are all fine, but sometimes things don't go your way. When that happens,\
  \ you want Kyra, Lem, Seelah, Lini, or maybe even Harsk to have one of these, and\
  \ they want it too. </p>\n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6004_MassCure_500.jpeg\"\

  ></a>\n     <br>And it didn't even take my whole turn!\n    </div> \n    <p>Oh,\
  \ one more thing: Did I mention that the stone giants brought a dragon?</p> \n \
  \   <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6004_Longtooth_500.jpeg\"\

  \ a dragon. It's sure to get toasty around here (unless you're Sajan. Sajan cheats.),\
  \ but with a bit of luck, or perhaps some magic, you might be able to fight dragon-fire\
  \ with dragon-fire.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6004_CharmedDragon_500.jpeg\"\

  \ you're happy to gain a boon if you roll well, and content to make progress if\
  \ you don't. Other times, you really want to succeed. This ally is worth the investment\
  \ (and not only because he doesn't like it when you fail!)</p> \n    <p>That's just\
  \ a sampling from the start of Fortress of the Stone Giants, where you finally get\
  \ to try out those shiny role cards you've been looking at for months. You'll go\
  \ on the offensive, taking the fight to the giants of Jorgenfist and learning a\
  \ little something about the forces behind all the troubles of the previous adventures.\
  \ But please, remember one thing: when you hear flapping wings and screeching in\
  \ the tower, that wasn't my fault.</p> \n    <p>Well, maybe a little. </p> \n  \
