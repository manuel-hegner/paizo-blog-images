  \ Emerald Spire Superdungeon</i></a> is the largest Pathfinder Module ever, which\
  \ means there's a lot to keep track of for GMs and players braving its perils. Adventurers\
  \ can end up on a number of different quests, talk to various recurring allies and\
  \ foes, and acquire a trove of odd relics and treasures. Players without good notes\
  \ might end up a bit lost somewhere between The Automaton Forge and The Pleasure\
  \ Garden.</span></p> \n    <p>For groups that find visual aids helpful, many of\
  \ these elements can be managed with the help of <a href=\"/products/btpy8xtr\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Campaign Cards: The Emerald Spire Superdungeon</i></a>. This set\
  \ of 53 full-color campaign cards tracks 18 quests on which the PCs may find themselves,\
  \ reveals the faces of 19 major NPCs, and unveils 16 mysterious items found in the\
  \ depths of the Emerald Spire.</p> \n    <p>And what will PCs encounter over 16\
  \ levels of dungeoneering? For another sneak peek, this week we talk to some of\
  \ the designers of the <a href=\"/products/btpy8yqx\"><i>Emerald Spire Superdungeon</i></a>.\
  \ We talked to Sean K Reynolds (prolific game designer and developer, founder of\
  \ Sean K Reynolds Games, and designer of level 5) and James L. Sutter (Managing\
  \ Editor at Paizo and designer of level 15) about how they approached creating their\
  \ dungeon levels, what they think a \"superdungeon\" is, and what inspired them\
  \ when crafting their portion of the Emerald Spire. </p>\n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ you define a \"Superdungeon\"?</h2> \n     <p><b>Sean</b><br> </p>\n     <p>I\
  \ define it as \"a dungeon that gets its powers from exposure to Earth's yellow\
  \ sun,\" as opposed to \"Spider-Dungeon,\" which got its powers from a radioactive\
  \ spider; \"Wonder-Dungeon,\" which got its powers as blessings from various Hellenic\
  \ deities; \"Invisible Dungeon,\" which got its powers from cosmic rays; or \"Ant-Dungeon,\"\
  \ which has a technological helmet that can communicate with bugs.</p> \n     <p><b>James</b><br>\
  \ </p>\n     <p>I think a superdungeon is an old-school dungeon romp that just keeps\
  \ going—room upon room of traps, monsters, and loot! While I was always more of\
  \ an urban adventures kid when it came to actual gameplay, I can still recall the\
  \ way those old-school Gary Gygax dungeon maps captured my imagination. What was\
  \ in those little gridded boxes, floating in the sea of black ink? It could be anything!\
  \ There was a sense of possibility that pulled me in at a really visceral level\
  \ (the same way I can remember how my first Magic cards smelled, or the feeling\
  \ of my first BattleTech set). Whether I had a game or not, I spent countless summer\
  \ hours with graph paper, drawing connected rooms without any idea what could be\
  \ in them. (Even today, I still sometimes like drawing a rough draft of a dungeon\
  \ map first, then letting that inspire its encounters.)</p> \n     <h2>What is your\
  \ favorite dungeon or superdungeon experience in your personal gaming history?</h2>\
  \ \n     <p><b>Sean</b><br> Hands down, when Monte Cook ran <i>Labyrinth of Madness</i>\
  \ for a bunch of TSR people as an all-nighter at his house in Lake Geneva, WI. It\
  \ was brutal, but we played high-level characters who alternately romped through\
  \ the challenges and got our butts kicked, and it was great fun.</p> \n     <p><b>James</b><br>\
  \ I never owned any superdungeons as a child, but of the ones I've encountered in\
  \ the years since, I think my favorite is Maure Castle. I was unfamiliar with it\
  \ until I started working at Paizo, and once I started editing for it, I was fascinated\
  \ by all the clues and secrets—who was the mysterious \"Y\"? It had never occurred\
  \ to me that a superdungeon could have overarching mysteries running through all\
  \ of the levels. So when it came time to write Emerald Spire, I was excited to have\
  \ tie-ins between my level and other folks' (most notably Wes Schneider's).</p>\
  \ \n     <h2>What is your level of the Emerald Spire Superdungeon called? What theme,\
  \ if any, does the level have?</h2> \n     <p><b>Sean</b><br> It was called \"The\
  \ Water Level\" in my turnover, because nobody told me we were supposed to come\
  \ up with names for our levels. Hopefully they changed the name in development into\
  \ something cooler, like \"The Hydro Level.\" <sub><i>(Developer Note: We actually\
  \ went with the MUCH more evocative \"The Drowned Level\")</i></sub> </p>\n    \
  \ <p><b>James</b><br> Mine is called \"Order and Chaos.\" I'm not going to lie—\
  going into the project, my goal was to be as self-indulgent as possible. Ever since\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy8oda\"><i>Death's Heretic</i></a>—and really since I wrote\
  \ the bit of protean speech that shows up in the Chapter 6 opener of the <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8ffn\"><i>GameMastery Guide</i></a>—I've felt a particular bond with\
  \ proteans and inevitables. They're just so delightfully alien! So in my level,\
  \ I wanted to give people the chance to encounter both of them, in an environment\
  \ that's almost as weird as the creatures themselves: partially mechanical and partially\
  \ warped by chaos. And of course, since I find social encounters as interesting\
  \ as combat (or more so), you have the opportunity to form an alliance with either\
  \ side, though neither really have your best interests at heart...</p> \n     <div\

  \ inspirations did you draw on for your Emerald Spire level, and what are you hoping\
  \ players get out of it?</h2> \n     <p><b>Sean</b><br> In the concept meeting for\
  \ the book we realized we wanted a water level for characters at about level 4 or\
  \ so. Much of the level is partially submerged or completely underwater, and navigating\
  \ the water and the lack of air are common challenges. As a scientist by training,\
  \ I tried to create a reasonable ecology in the level, with microportals to the\
  \ Plane of Water keeping most of it fresh and providing suitable food for the inhabitants,\
  \ and also setting up active currents in what otherwise would be still, stagnant\
  \ dungeon water. I also like to mess with darkness in dungeons (as mentioned in\
  \ intern Hank Woon's blogs about my <a href=\"/products/btpy89a4\"><i>Bastards of\
  \ Erebus</i></a> playtest game), and using murky water (filled with silt and gross\
  \ stuff) accomplishes the same thing as darkness. I'm hoping players will be challenged\
  \ and annoyed by the water level, but will figure out ways for their characters\
  \ to routinely overcome those obstacles—basically, to make the dungeon a learning\
  \ experience for them.</p> \n     <p><b>James</b><br> Really, that chapter opener\
  \ from the <a href=\"/products/btpy8ffn\"><i>GameMastery Guide</i></a> is probably\
  \ the single biggest inspiration for my level—I've always wanted to play through\
  \ that particular scene, and despite the fact that this is a dungeon level, I hope\
  \ that I've come close to capturing its feel. More than anything, though, I just\
  \ want players to have fun, which for me always means seeing new (and weird!) creatures\
  \ and landscapes. So in my level, every room is different, there are bizarre magical\
  \ effects, and you rarely fight the same critter twice.</p> \n     <p>Oh, and there\
  \ are robots. Because robots.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>We hope your appetite\
  \ is whetted by this glimpse of the visions you may find in the lower reaches of\
  \ The Emerald Spire! Next week we'll look at a few more Emerald Spire tie-in products\
  \ GMs are sure to find useful, and maybe even preview some of the superdungeon maps!</p>\
