  date\">Wednesday, July 14, 2010</p> \n   <p>Heads up, everybody! As of last week\
  \ (turns out the blog can get a little packed during the summer), <a href=\"/pathfinder/campaignSetting/v5748btpy8b7r\"\
  ><i>City of Strangers</i></a> has officially left the building, shipping out to\
  \ subscribers and anyone else who wants to pick up a copy. This'll probably be my\
  \ last post about the book for some time, but I wanted to reiterate how excited\
  \ I am (and how cool it is to see folks commenting on the product page!). We put\
  \ out a lot of awesome books, but this one has been in the back of my head—or on\
  \ the desktop of my computer, glaring accusatorily at me, demanding to be finished—\
  for about four years at this point. To finally get it out there and see people's\
  \ reactions, well... it's a lot of fun.</p>\n  </blockquote> \n  <div align=\"left\"\

  \  </div> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>And you know, I still haven't gotten over the\
  \ book itself yet, either. Normally by the time we finish developing a book and\
  \ drag it, bruised and bloody, across the finish line (also known as \"shipping\
  \ it to the printer\"), there's some angst mixed in with the love—not because it\
  \ isn't great, but because all we can see when we look at it is sweat and tears,\
  \ and maybe some weekends spent in the office. Yet when it comes back from the printer,\
  \ all shiny and new, we all get that new-baby glow I keep hearing about. In this\
  \ case, though the book had a whole lot of midwives, I really feel like the father,\
  \ and the fact that Jared Blando's maps perfectly captured my hopes, and the artists\
  \ (and art staff!) outdid themselves to bring the words to life... well, I've probably\
  \ waxed maudlin long enough. Here's an example instead:</p> \n   <p>When I first\
  \ wrote about the city in <a href=\"/pathfinderModules/v5748btpy7zke\"><i>Seven\
  \ Swords of Sin</i></a>, there were quite a few details I threw in at random, which\
  \ folks then picked up on and asked about. What, for instance, were the wormfolk?\
  \ I certainly didn't know. It wasn't until Eando Kline came up against one in <a\
  \ href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/v5748btpy80e8\"><i>Pathfinder Adventure Path</i>\
  \ #3</a> that I realized they were nagas. And though I had a pretty good mental\
  \ image of what they looked like, that was nothing compared to Christopher Burdett's\
  \ fabulous illustration.</p> \n   <p><i>This</i>, ladies and gentlemen, is one of\
  \ the wormfolk. (Though don't let her hear you calling her that.)</p> \n   <p>In\
  \ any case, it's been a fabulous ride thus far, and I hope that those of you who\
  \ check out the book enjoy your time in the city as much as I have!</p> \n   <br\
