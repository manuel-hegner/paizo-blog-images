  \ a preview of <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01yz0?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-1022-Passing-the-Torch-Part-1-Who-Wears-the-Mask\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario 10-22: Passing the Torch, Part 1: Who Wears the\
  \ Mask</em></a>. But when I reviewed developer Linda Zayas-Palmer’s words, I kept\
  \ thinking about Avengers: Endgame spoilers and how I didn’t want to be \"that person\"\
  . So, I’m including her review here, with appropriate edits to keep us spoiler free.</p>\
  \ <strong>[Spoiler=Linda's Scenario Review]</strong>\n     <br> \n     <div style=\"\
  border-top: 1px solid #fff; border-radius:10px; color: #000; text-decoration: none;\
  \  padding: 5px 10px; margin: 0 auto; background: rgba(160,82,45, 0.1); width: 75%;\
  \ display: block; position: relative;\"> \n      <blockquote> \n       <p style=\"\
  line-height: 20px;\">This scenario kicks off at the <strong>[REDACTED]</strong>,\
  \ with the PCs being personally selected by an iconic member of the <strong>[REDACTED]</strong>,\
  \ the fellow in the <strong>[REDACTED]</strong>, to embark on a gravely perilous\
  \ mission. As he explains in the mission briefing, he has discovered a plot to bring\
  \ about the Pathfinder Society's ruin, a <strong>[REDACTED]</strong> by two familiar\
  \ faces. The first, and the one he sends the PCs after in this scenario, is <strong>[REDACTED]</strong>,\
  \ who was responsible for the death of a <strong>[REDACTED]</strong> in the early\
  \ days of the Society. <strong>[REDACTED]</strong> is a <strong>[REDACTED]</strong>,\
  \ best known for her rediscovered troves of knowledge in <strong>[REDACTED]</strong>\
  \ and her appearance in a vision of sorts <strong>[REDACTED]</strong>. The second\
  \ is none other than <strong>[REDACTED]</strong>. <strong>[REDACTED]</strong> will\
  \ be the focus of Part 2 of this series, coming out in July. </p> \n       <p style=\"\
  line-height: 20px;\">So, if <strong>[REDACTED]</strong> killed a <strong>[REDACTED]</strong>\
  \ hundreds of years ago, how has she managed to stay underground for so long? The\
  \ answer is simple—a combination of <strong>[REDACTED]</strong> and the choice to\
  \ live in the one place where merely being a <strong>[REDACTED]</strong> is a crime\
  \ worthy of <strong>[REDACTED]</strong>. That is, the infamous stronghold of the\
  \ <strong>[REDACTED]</strong>, <strong>[REDACTED]</strong>. At Tier 12-18, the PCs\
  \ have reached a level where they can fend off hordes of the <strong>[REDACTED]</strong>\
  \ rank and file if they need to. But of course, the PCs' real foes are far from\
  \ the rank and file. In this scenario, the PCs will cross blades with some of the\
  \ <strong>[REDACTED]</strong> most powerful forces, as well as the deadliest and\
  \ most colossal dangers that lurk in the <strong>[REDACTED]</strong> jungles. And\
  \ they will learn secrets that have been buried for centuries, secrets that could\
  \ well spell the <strong>[REDACTED]</strong> doom.<br> </p>\n      </blockquote>\
  \ \n     </div> <strong>[/spoiler]</strong>\n     <p></p> \n     <p>There. I don't\
  \ think I let the cat out of the bag. I ask the rest of you to swear yourselves\
  \ to silence as well, so that everyone may experience the penultimate scenario in\
  \ their own time. Tune in next month as we bring the first part of the Pathfinder\
  \ Society to a thundering close in July's capstone scenario!</p> \n     <p>Remember,\
  \ <strong>[REDACTED]</strong> demands your silence.</p> \n     <h2>Campaign Coins</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>When several Organized Play team members attended Origins a couple weekends\
  \ ago, we had the opportunity to recognize some of the campaigns' hard-working volunteers.\
  \ There are few things that bring me as much satisfaction as seeing the look on\
  \ a volunteer's face as they realize I'm talking about them. Please take a moment\
  \ to thank the following community members for their efforts on behalf of our gaming\
  \ community and congratulate them on receiving new Org Play numbers!</p> \n    \
  \ <table width=\"500\" align=\"center\"> \n      <tbody>\n       <tr> \n       \
  \ <td width=\"50%\"><strong>Recipient</strong></td> \n        <td><strong>Org Play\

  \ \n     <p>During May and June, several GMs crested the summit of 5-star mountain.\
  \ To achieve this milestone, GMs run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique\
  \ scenarios and 10 special scenarios, as well as run a game for a venture-captain.\
  \ A conservative estimate of time needed to reach 5-stars is 650 hours! To the GMs\
  \ listed below, thank you very much for the time and energy you spend running Pathfinder\
  \ Society games! Three cheers on your achievement!</p> \n     <p>Perry Frix<br>\
  \ Ken Fisher<br> Amber Hipsher<br> Zac Daniel<br> Christina Rasmussen<br> Earl Gessner<br>\
  \ Elizabeth Roper<br> Andy Fry<br> Erich Deines </p> \n     <p>As we wrap up our\
  \ production on Pathfinder Society (1st edition) scenarios, we would like to reiterate\
  \ that this is not the end of the road for the campaign. Just as scenarios still\
  \ count for event support and players can still earn boons at events, games ran\
  \ will still count towards star requirements. So don't worry if you're not quite\
  \ to your goals, there will still be time to reach for the stars.</p> \n     <h2>Novas\
  \ &amp; Glyphs</h2> \n     <p>We've spent the past six weeks trying out the rubric\
  \ and receiving feedback on the review process. So far, what we've heard is positive.\
  \ I've been working with tech to get the review reporting online. We ran into a\
  \ little blip when our tech liaison had an extended leave of absence, but we are\
  \ back up and running and hope to have these improvements rolled out soon.</p> \n\
  \     <h2>Convention Listing</h2> \n     <p>We have organized play activities at\
  \ quite a few conventions in the upcoming months, so if you want to get your game\
  \ on, check out the list below! The list includes all the event support requests\
  \ received to date. If you see one missing, ping the organizer and have them submit\
  \ a request for support or have them email me at organizedplay@paizo.com to discuss\
  \ their event. All of the conventions on the list maintain some type of web presence,\
  \ be it website, social media page, or Warhorn listing, so if you are interested\
  \ in attending in either capacity, check out their websites or contact the local\
  \ venture-officer for more information!</p> \n     <table width=\"800\" align=\"\
