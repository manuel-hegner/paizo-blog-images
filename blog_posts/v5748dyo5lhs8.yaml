  > \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">This week marks the start of the third chapter\
  \ of the <a href=\"/pfsacg/products/season1\">Season of the Righteous</a> storyline\
  \ for the <a href=\"pfsacg\">Adventure Card Guild</a>. Season of the Righteous is\
  \ a complementary story to the cataclysmic events of the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/wrathOfTheRighteous\"\
  ><em>Wrath of the Righteous</em></a>. The heroes who brave its dangers are fully\
  \ as powerful and important to the plot as those who go through the main AP, but\
  \ they deal with other events of the Fifth Crusade.</p> \n    <p>Where is the Herald\
  \ of Iomedae at the start of Wrath? Kicking demon butt with you, of course.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Who finds the <i>Lexicon of Paradox</i>? The saints and martyrs who complete\
  \ Adventure 3, premiering at Gen Con this Thursday!</p> \n    <h2>The Story So Far\
  \ (beware—this way lies season spoilers!):</h2> \n    <p><b><a href=\"/products/btpy9ewl\"\
  >Adventure 1-1: Herald's Chosen</a></b><br> The Herald of Iomedae, also known as\
  \ the Hand of the Inheritor, has divined that demons are up to no good. <i>When\
  \ are they not?</i> The Herald chose the best and brightest crusaders available\
  \ (and maybe a Darago or two who snuck in.) You cleared the fortress city of Kenabres\
  \ of a gathering herd of fiendish minotaurs, as well as a gaggle of demon-summoning,\
  \ polymorphing witches. You then cut your way past the Fiendish Tree ruler of Storasta\
  \ to save Fort Clearwater from both itself and demonic invasion. By the end, you\
  \ were not only granted mythic power for your deeds, but also hot on the trail of\
  \ an obvious trap, and the Herald totally knew how to safely spring it.</p> \n \

  >Adventure 1-2: War for the Worldwound</a></b><br> Sound the horns, beat the drums,\
  \ and let sing the tenors of war! With a Rallying Cry, and over the bodies of a\
  \ few demonic mongrels, you gathered a powerful army to your side. You led them\
  \ fearlessly against armies of cultists, undead, and demons in order to reach Raliscrad.\
  \ But the Herald's confidence proved to be hubris: he sprung the demons' trap and\
  \ was somehow spirited away. Even as you did all you could to keep your army alive,\
  \ the wardstone in Kenabres shattered. You laid waste to armies of evil, but the\
  \ demonic hordes are seemingly endless. With the loss of the Kenabres, the line\
  \ of wardstones, and the Herald, have you already lost the war?</p> \n    <h2>The\
  \ Lexicon of Paradox</h2> \n    <p>That brings us to the current adventure. Your\
  \ only hope of stopping the demonic hordes from flooding through the Worldwound\
  \ is to find the <i>Lexicon of Paradox</i>, the powerful artifact that originally\
  \ opened the Worldwound. Queen Galfrey would not ask you to undertake such a dangerous\
  \ quest without assistance. The renowned adventurer Count Varian Jeggare and his\
  \ bodyguard Radovan Virholt are also looking for the Lexicon, and the queen is sending\
  \ along one of her most powerful paladins, Captain Oparal.</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  \ know how much I like to look good.<br> Varian: Some choose to wield the sword,\
  \ others the grimoire. I note that we have two hands.</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>If\
  \ these heroes and this quest sound familiar to you, it's because they're the stars\
  \ of several Pathfinder Tales novels by the outstanding Dave Gross, who helped us\
  \ write the text for this adventure. More details about the events in Adventure\
  \ 3 are recounted quite directly in <i><a href=\" /products/btpy90py\">Pathfinder\
  \ Tales: King of Chaos</a></i>. (<i><a href=\"/products/btpy8g3n\">Prince of Wolves</a></i>,\
  \ <i><a href=\"/products/btpy8mfm\">Master of Devils</a></i>, and <i><a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8u7i\">Queen of Thorns</a></i> precede that novel, but you don't need\
  \ to read them first.)</p> \n    <p>Hope to see many of you at Gen Con! I'll be\
  \ at the ACG Open, as well as bouncing between the Paizo booth in the exhibitor\
  \ hall and the ACG area in the Sagamore Ballroom.</p> \n    <p>Get out there and\
  \ take back the Worldwound, my crusaders. It's demon-clobbering time!</p> \n   \
