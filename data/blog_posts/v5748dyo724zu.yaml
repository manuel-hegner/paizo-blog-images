  \ those within their employ,</p>\n      <p>As His Ghostly Majesty’s newly appointed\
  \ diplomat to Absalom, I have taken it upon myself to study how to interact with\
  \ the living citizens of our surrounding nations. And I am <em>most honored</em>\
  \ that our king has requested that I share this information with all of you. Every\
  \ night, Mechitar grows grander and more cosmopolitan. It’s no surprise that other\
  \ nations are curious about us and our customs, but even as they come to know our\
  \ traditions and fawn over our elegant architecture and beautiful works of art,\
  \ it is our duty to make ourselves aware of their sometimes backward and simple\
  \ ways.</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/b4ca7679-21ff-45e5-b934-745afdda8ce5/Geb_Procession.jpg\"\

  font-size: 13px;\"></p>\n      </div>\n      <p>I have included some helpful tips\
  \ that have been shared with me during my time among the breathing:</p>\n      <p>1)\
  \ If a living being approaches you and smells very strongly, it is not appropriate\
  \ to question if they have extraneous parasites living within them. This is apparently\
  \ deeply rude, even though we know that our ghoul companions would be flattered\
  \ that we noticed their new stench.</p>\n      <p>2) “You look very alive today!”\
  \ seems like it would be a good compliment. However, I was informed by my newest\
  \ companions that strikes the living as <em>morbid</em> and <em>threatening</em>,\
  \ even when accompanied by a skeletal smile.</p>\n      <p>3) If you’re invited\
  \ to dine with the living, it is acceptable to communicate to them the type of sustenance\
  \ you prefer and where they might be able to locate it within their city. Offering\
  \ to fetch it yourself from their staff can seem predatory.</p>\n      <p>4) Living\
  \ beings do not enjoy some of our standard party tricks and jokes. During my <em>hilarious</em>\
  \ story about how I met my darling friend Zoroq, I removed my head to mimic my old\
  \ schoolteacher (as one does when playing the role of skeletal halfling) and it\
  \ scared the daylights out of my host’s children, except for his youngest.</p>\n\
  \      <p>5) When you’re taken around a city and shown the sites, remarking about\
  \ your own experiences during the times when their buildings were built is often\
  \ seen as charming. However, if you notice another undead milling about, it’s best\
  \ to ensure that your companions are already aware of their presence before striking\
  \ up a conversation. Who knew the Grand Lodge of Absalom had so many ghosts that\
  \ the Pathfinder Society was unaware of?</p>\n      <p>I hope this letter has been\
  \ quite informative to my fellow leaders of Geb, and I hope Geb himself approves\
  \ of my work and the information I have shared.</p>\n      <p>For Eternity,</p>\n\
  \      <p>Blood Lord Msasa Kuatuz<br>\n        Export Guild</p>\n      <p>Happy\
  \ Halloween, Pathfinders!</p>\n      <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight:\
