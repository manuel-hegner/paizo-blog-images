  \ mixing things up a bit! Wednesdays are the new day for organized play-related\
  \ content. Check back frequently, as in the run up to Gen Con the team is putting\
  \ together double blogs to deliver previews of the Starfinder Society Roleplaying\
  \ Guild while maintaining all our regular Pathfinder Society content.</i></p> \n\
  \     <p itemprop=\"description\">I took some time this weekend to recharge my gaming\
  \ batteries. On Saturday, I attended a mini-con at Mox Boardinghouse in Bellevue.\
  \ During the afternoon, nine tables battled through a myriad of pregenerated specials\
  \ and harder scenarios such as <a href=\"/products/btpy8we6?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-4-26-The-Waking-Rune\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #4-26: The Waking Rune</em></a>. I got a chance\
  \ to chat with local players and look in on some of their games. I left before the\
  \ start of the multi-table interactive special event, <a href=\"/products/btpy9cu7?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-7-00-The-Sky-Key-Solution\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #7-00: The Sky Key Solution</em></a>. I hear there\
  \ were several deaths, but the Society emerged victorious.</p> \n     <p>On Sunday,\
  \ I GMed a table of <a href=\"/products/btpy9k93?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-7-20-All-for-Immortality-Part-1-First-Taste-of-Eternity\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #7-20: All for Immortality, pt. 1: First Taste\
  \ of Eternity</em></a> for a group of local 5 star GMs. I really like this Seeker\
  \ arc, in that it pulls together the Aspis storyline into a tight package and wraps\
  \ up many, but not all, of the loose ends from a Season 7. I can't wait until next\
  \ weekend, where we tackle part two. Thanks to the players that made my afternoon\
  \ so enjoyable!</p> \n     <h2>Player Survey</h2> \n     <p>One of the focuses when\
  \ I stepped into the position of Organized Play Coordinator was looking at the data\
  \ and seeing how it supported our decisions as a team and drove our future plans.\
  \ We've done that with event support and with scenario reporting. Our next focus\
  \ is on characters and seasons. We've put together a survey through Survey Monkey\
  \ to gather this data for use in future decisions. As a thank you for taking time\
  \ to complete our questions, John put together a thank you boon that may be applied\
  \ to one of your Pathfinder Society characters.</p> \n     <h3 style=\"text-align:\
  \ center;\"><a href=\"https://surveymonkey.com/r/PathfinderSociety\" target=\"_blank\"\
  >Pathfinder Society Survey</a></h3> \n     <h2 class=\"spaced-header-small\">Newest\
  \ 5 Star GMs</h2> \n     <p>The list of five star GMs grew again this month. Thanks\
  \ to the GMs who gave of their time and energies to run 150 games for players, including\
  \ 50 different scenarios and 10 special events. Kudos to the recipients for achieving\
  \ this milestone and to all 5 star GMs for their time and devotion to our hobby.\
  \ Without you, the Pathfinder Society would not exist.</p> \n     <ul>\n      <li>Mikko\

  \ \n     <p>Just like the tides, the number of conventions may ebb and flow, but\
  \ something is always occurring somewhere. To assist in finding events near you,\
  \ or ones far away you may wish to travel to, here is a list of conventions running\
  \ Pathfinder Society over the two months. There are many more conventions out there,\
  \ but these are the ones that requested support through the Pathfinder Society.\
  \ May is pretty solid, but June's requests are still coming in, so more will add\
  \ to this list. Consider dropping in and checking one out!</p> \n     <blockquote>\
