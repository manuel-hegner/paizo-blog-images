  \ saw my return from the frozen north. It seems I brought some of the white stuff\
  \ with me as western Washington weather takes a plunge into ice and snow. Makes\
  \ me want to curl up in front of a fire with a steaming cup of cocoa and a fluffy\
  \ blanket. Instead, I will grab a mug and chat with you all for a bit.</p> \n  \
  \  <p>So what does the New Year bring? Last week, John looked back on Pathfinder\
  \ Society Roleplaying Guild in 2015 and some of his plans for 2016. John focused\
  \ on the development side, and there’s more on the organizational front. So here\
  \ we go!</p> \n    <p><a href=\"/paizo/blog/tags/genCon\">Gencon</a>! <a href=\"\
  /paizo/blog/tags/paizocon\">PaizoCon</a>! PAX Prime! The turn of the year brings\
  \ us back to convention season, and with it comes a need for GM and Headquarter\
  \ volunteers. I got my start in PFS coordination by organizing a convention. Working\
  \ a convention brings fantastic opportunities to meet people and see the hidden\
  \ side of Pathfinder Society. So, watch this space for my call to arms, er, pens,\
  \ as I will post a separate blog soon with the details! Also on the convention front,\
  \ I’m working on a Convention Organizer Handbook aimed at giving new organizers\
  \ the basics and providing tips and tricks for the experienced planner. If you have\
  \ ideas for inclusion, email them to me! I would love this to be a group effort.</p>\

  /pfsacg\">Adventure Card Guild</a> returns to its roots with Season of the Runelords.\
  \ While I’ll leave it to Tanis to give the details, we are delving back in with\
  \ our favorite NPCs like Ameiko and villains like Karzoug. I loved running the Adventure\
  \ Path for my home crew in England and look forward to seeing it translated into\
  \ the Card Game. Look for me at the ACG tables at a convention near you!</p> \n\
  \    <p>Which brings up another point—travel! I’m still finalizing my travel schedule,\
  \ but have a few locked and loaded! I’m hoping to get to a variety of locales this\
  \ year to include Minnesota, Edmonton, Birmingham (UK), Quad Cities, Fort Wayne,\
  \ San Francisco! As plans solidify, I will post more details here on the Paizo blog.\
  \ In any case, please come introduce yourself—I love to meet fellow Pathfinders!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Just before the holidays, I announced a Pathfinder Society competition.\
  \ You still have time to get your entries in before the January 11 deadline. If\
  \ you missed the original post, <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5libk\">here it is</a>!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>One new big project for 2016 is the launch of Pathfinder Society Academy.\
  \ It is Pathfinder Society for our younger players, with new Kid’s Track lessons,\
  \ youth-friendly tables, a Young GM mentor program, and other youth-focused initiatives.\
  \ Up to now, we only offered Kid’s Track at Gen Con. The Academy allows us to offer\
  \ Kid’s Track to convention organizers worldwide, as well as support youth gaming.\
  \ Here’s to a new generation of gamers!</p> \n    <p>Thank you, Pathfinders, for\
  \ making 2015 a fantastic year. Here’s to an even better 2016!</p> \n    <p>Explore,\
  \ Report, Cooperate!</p> \n    <p>Tonya Woldridge<br> <i>Organized Play Coordinator</i></p>\
