  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Hello to everyone in the\
  \ Paizoverse, Steve here from Hideous Laughter Productions and today I’m thrilled\
  \ to help announce that Paizo and our network have signed a licensing deal to help\
  \ us grow our shows and continue sharing our adventures across the globe!</p> \n\
  \     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/b477c7aa-be13-4ad7-a2fd-87030224f8e0/111720_FullPodImage.jpg\"\

  \ 13px;\"></p>\n     </div> \n     <h3>Who are we?</h3> \n     <p>For those of you\
  \ who don’t know us, Hideous Laughter Productions is a Columbus, OH based podcast\
  \ network. Our flagship show is the Hideous Laughter Podcast where four of my best\
  \ friends and I get to disconnect from the real world every week and tell the story\
  \ of adventurers unwrapping a mystery and stirring up some scares in Paizo’s gothic\
  \ horror Pathfinder 1E adventure path Carrion Crown. Our “brand” per se is that\
  \ we want every listener to feel like they’re at the table with us and invoke the\
  \ feeling of gaming together with your friends on a Friday night. What does that\
  \ mean? For us, the atmosphere around the table is just as important as the rules\
  \ or setting on the table! Over the last few years of turning our adventures into\
  \ a podcast, we’ve laughed, cheered, and cried together as our characters and story\
  \ grew beyond what any of us ever expected. We pride ourselves in bringing our all\
  \ every week and delivering a show with top-notch audio quality and storytelling!</p>\
  \ \n     <h3>Why Pathfinder?</h3> \n     <p>At any given time, between the Pathfinder\
  \ Tales novels, the core rulebooks, and lore supplements, there are easily 4+ Paizo\
  \ publications on my bedside table in some stage of being read through, and I know\
  \ my enthusiasm for the system is not unique among my fellow players at Hideous\
  \ Laughter Productions! From the mysterious depths of Golarion, to distant space\
  \ far beyond the Pact Worlds, and everywhere in between, I (and the rest of my fellow\
  \ HLP gamers) love exploring the universe Paizo has created and crafting stories\
  \ in it! Our group has gamed together long before the show and has played through\
  \ several adventure paths across both the Pathfinder and Starfinder systems. We’\
  re absolute nerds for the game mechanics and lore, so when we decided to start a\
  \ podcast two years ago the Pathfinder system was a no brainer!</p> \n     <h3>What\
  \ Else? Beyond Carrion Crown!</h3> \n     <p>Though our podcast network debuted\
  \ with our flagship Carrion Crown show, quickly we began to realize that we had\
  \ an appetite for more! Releasing the regular show was great, but what else could\
  \ we do? What other stories could we tell?</p> \n     <ul> \n      <li><b>Zone of\
  \ Truth</b> - Along with the main show, our main podcast feed also hosts the Zone\
  \ of Truth, a biweekly podcast where Griffin (our GM for Carrion Crown) and myself\
  \ host a conversational and interview-style show where we discuss what’s happening\
  \ behind the screens from a GM and player perspective, review new and upcoming Paizo\
  \ and Pathfinder related products, deep dive into some of the juiciest Pathfinder\
  \ lore, and interview exciting content creators in the TTRPG space!</li> \n    \
  \  <li><b>HLP Evil Interlude</b> – Also on the main feed and a prequel-companion\
  \ show to Hideous Laughter Productions’ flagship Carrion Crown adventure run, the\
  \ HLP Evil Interlude stars four evil “heroes” setting the stage for some of the\
  \ biggest moments in Carrion Crown! Homebrewed and run by GM Griffin, this show\
  \ is a must-listen for fans of deep Pathfinder lore and folks who enjoy listening\
  \ to something different from an Adventure Path. And what can I say, sometimes it\
  \ just feels good to be bad!</li> \n      <li><b>Linked Legacy</b> - This anthology\
  \ series departs from HLP tradition, putting different members of the HLP into the\
  \ GM seat to tell new stories set against the backdrop of classic pathfinder modules.\
  \ Available to all subscribers to the HLP Patreon at the $5 tier or above, the Linked\
  \ Legacy podcast is sure to surprise and delight new and longtime listeners of the\
  \ show alike!</li> \n     </ul> \n     <h3>So, What Now?</h3> \n     <p>With the\
  \ partnership between Paizo and Hideous Laughter Productions made official, adventures\
  \ truly await, and Hideous Laughter Productions is looking forward to doing bigger\
  \ and better things than ever before! I sincerely hope you check us out and fall\
  \ in love with our characters and story just as much as we have. Below I’ve hyperlinked\
  \ our link tree site and from there you can find us on all your favorite social\
  \ media sites, our website, Patreon, and many of the world’s biggest podcast platforms.\
  \ To all the horror buffs and more traditional fantasy roleplaying fans out there,\
  \ to all the number crunchers and RP enthusiasts, we’ve got something for everyone\
  \ in our show and I look forward to sharing our stories with you and interacting\
  \ with you all online! See you there!</p> \n     <center>\n      <a href=\"https://linktr.ee/hideouslaughterpod\"\
