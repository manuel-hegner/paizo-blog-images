  \ Rival Academies,</em> I was tasked with bringing Messida Vost, an NPC who debuted\
  \ all the way back in a first edition adventure, forward to second edition in her\
  \ new role as the Acadamae's Dean of Summoning. I think it’s safe to say that of\
  \ all the faculty they can meet in this book, your players might just find Vost\
  \ the most abrasive. (Although, who among us hasn’t known a teacher like that?)\
  \ She does, however, come bearing some ambitious—if dangerous—ideas about how best\
  \ to solve the Sarkoris Scar’s demon problem. If you end up using her in your game,\

  \ Having plumbed the depths of the Dark Archive, I thought I was safe. But no. There\
  \ is no safety from academia.</p>\n      <p>I was responsible for the University\
  \ of Lepidstadt in this book, because for some peculiar reason everyone looked at\
  \ the creepy gothic school and immediately went “this is a Mikhail thing.” It is\
  \ possible I have a reputation. We will politely skip over what sort. In any case,\
  \ like any proper school, Lepidstadt has its share of secret passages, ghosts, mysteries,\
  \ crumbling papers, unresolved murders, ghosts, architects who entombed themselves\
  \ within their own work, hoary old secrets, raven statues, ancient cursed relics,\
  \ Prof. Nefritius-Sincoth, ghosts, evil books, disappearing rooms, and most terrifying\
  \ of all—university politics.</p>\n      <p>Also ghosts. Just, like, so many ghosts.</p>\n\
  \      <p>In the event that you survive your term at Lepidstadt with psyche and/or\
  \ bank account intact, you may try the post-graduate course at the <a href=\"https://luminant-age.itch.io/\"\

  \ (she/her)</h3>\n      <p>Hello, I'm Kendra Leigh Speedling, frequent contributor\
  \ to Paizo and erstwhile academic—I did a master's degree for library science and\
  \ loved it, I but staunchly shooed off anyone who suggested I go for the PhD. (For\
  \ the curious, I went to school in London, did my dissertation on the interplay\
  \ between libraries and imperialism in 19th-century Britain, and took four months\
  \ after graduation to stop defaulting to UK spellings.)</p>\n      <p>Given all\
  \ that, I was delighted to be asked on for <em>Rival Academies</em>! I did the Cobyslarni\
  \ section of the book, where I had a great deal of fun working in fey weirdness\
  \ and shenanigans. Cobyslarni has fascinated me ever since its first mention in\
  \ 1e, and expanding on it was a dream assignment. My love of libraries definitely\
  \ influenced the Echo Repository, home of (literally) forgotten knowledge, and the\
  \ art for Murrou, an awakened emu grad student with excellent sartorial taste, is\
  \ one of my favorite pieces in the whole book. I hope you all enjoy the chance to\
  \ explore the school—and maybe even form a pact with Cobyslarni himself!</p>\n \

  \ Singapore.</p>\n      <p>As the years murmur one after another, I find myself\
  \ shifting from ambivalence to acceptance in my academic role. Some of these aspirations\
