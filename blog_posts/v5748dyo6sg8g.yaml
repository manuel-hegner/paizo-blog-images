  \ \n     <p itemprop=\"description\"></p>\n     <h2>Gen Con Recap</h2> \n     <p>Per\
  \ our post-con tradition, the team wrote paragraphs about the highlights of their\
  \ Gen Con attendance. Some pesky goblins got in the wiring and disrupted our postings\
  \ for a few weeks, which led to us not sharing our experiences. Even though we are\
  \ a month past Gen Con, we wanted to take a moment and share what we thought of\
  \ Gen Con 2018! For my part, one of my favorite things about Gen Con involves the\
  \ building of the Sagamore. We start Monday morning with an empty room and by early\
  \ Thursday morning turn it into one of the most happening locations at the convention.\
  \ With over 1000 games running 24/7, the room never sleeps! Thank you to all the\
  \ volunteers who make such an endeavor possible!!!! We couldn't do it without you\
  \ and you enrich the Pathfinder Society/Starfinder Society with your contribution\
  \ of energy and effort.</p> \n     <p>To keep the blog a manageable length, I considered\
  \ editing down the posts. But choosing what to take out proved impossible (hats\
  \ off to our developers and editors, as I don't know how they decide what stays\
  \ in a manuscript. It's harder than it looks!) Instead, I tucked them behind spoiler\
  \ tags. Here, for your reading pleasure:</p> \n     <div style=\"margin: 10px 0;\"\

  \ <p>Gen Con is always a whirlwind. I feel like I'm running constantly, trying to\
  \ catch a few minutes to talk to as many of the wonderful people in our Organized\
  \ Play community as I can. It's gotten to the point where I don't even have time\
  \ to find everyone that I remember fondly from previous years.</p> \n       <p>My\
  \ first year at Gen Con was 2009, which was also my first experience with Pathfinder\
  \ Society. That year was followed by several more, in which I spent increasing amounts\
  \ of time in the Sagamore Ballroom, eventually trying my hand at convention GMing\
  \ and HQ. I met Tonya in the Sagamore in 2014, as one of the Tier 1 HQ volunteers.\
  \ I remember getting so absorbed in the energy of the room that I forgot to eat,\
  \ and the way Tonya reacted when I told her I'd skipped a meal. For the rest of\
  \ the show, Tonya regularly checked in on me, and kept putting snacks between me\
  \ and whatever I was working on. I joined Paizo the following year. It's worth noting\
  \ that when Tonya came on board as well, she checked on me in the same way she had\
  \ at Gen Con, this time with homemade goodies.</p> \n       <p>Gen Con as a Paizo\
  \ employee is certainly different from Gen Con as a fan. First off, there's the\
  \ Venture-Captain dinner on Wednesday night, a chance to share a meal and catch\
  \ up with some of the most dedicated volunteers. This year, my flight to Indy was\
  \ delayed, but I was glad to make it in time to merely be fashionably late to the\
  \ event. After that, I got a chance to talk with Thursty in person, proving that\
  \ he is not a figment of text and video calls on John's tablet. We wandered over\
  \ to the Sagamore to help out with the final stages of setup before the first morning\
  \ of the show. The energy on the first day of GenCon is incredible. Standing inside\
  \ the Paizo booth waiting for the doors to open, I can feel the crowds massing on\
  \ the other side of the door, and the exhibitors bracing themselves. Sometimes I\
  \ play the music from the Battle of Helm's Deep in my head in this moment. And then\
  \ the doors swing open, and the show begins.</p> \n       <p>While I enjoy working\
  \ in the booth, I spend as much time in the Sagamore as I can. The highlight of\
  \ this year for me was overseeing <i><a href=\"/products/btpya1xz?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-1000-The-Hao-Jin-Cataclysm\"\
  >#10-00: The Hao Jin Cataclysm</a></i>. I'd been working on that scenario for months,\
  \ along with about a dozen other people that it took to pull all of this together:\
  \ authors, artists, voice actors, Syrinscape folks, and members of the tech, art,\
  \ editing, website, and marketing teams. Thank you to everyone who helped make the\
  \ special a success, both those who helped create it and the volunteers who brought\
  \ it to life.</p> \n       <p>In addition to time in the booth and the Sagamore,\
  \ I also got the chance to participate in a few panels: one about secrets of Golarion,\
  \ one about adventure design and one about what's coming next for the Adventure\
  \ Card Game. If you're interested in hearing what we said, or listening to any of\
  \ the other panels Paizo offered at Gen Con, head over to<u><a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/officialpaizo\"\
  >https://www.twitch.tv/officialpaizo</a></u>. I'm looking forward to seeing many\
  \ of you at Gen Con again next year!</p>\n      </div>\n     </div> \n     <div\

  \  <div class=\"spoiler-text\"> \n       <p>This year's Gen Con was one for the\
  \ history books! Getting to see the first Starfinder Society interactive scenario\
  \ run in the Sagamore ballroom is certainly an item to check off my bucket list.\
  \ The best memory from the convention is an amalgam of all the stories I got to\
  \ her from Starfinder Society players. Starfinder Society launched the previous\
  \ year at Gen Con, and getting the opportunity to hear from players from across\
  \ the world about the impact of the game was something that deeply moved me. As\
  \ with most conventions, Gen Con 2018 sure did recharge my batteries (as one would\
  \ expect between scenarios!)</p>\n      </div>\n     </div> \n     <div style=\"\

  spoiler-text\"> \n       <p>This year's Gen Con was among the smoothest I've been\
  \ a part of. The growing organized play developer team handled the huge number of\
  \ scenarios well, and the three different specials all proceeded smoothly. This\
  \ last point was true in part because each multi-table interactive special was in\
  \ a different developer's hands—a huge boon considering how much effort each of\
  \ those takes to pull together. <a href=\"/products/btpya1xz?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-1000-The-Hao-Jin-Cataclysm\"\
  >The Hao Jin Cataclysm</a>, which debuted that weekend, was especially spectacular\
  \ thanks to the pre-recorded voice talents of Jason Keeley (Aram Zey) and Samantha\
  \ Phelan (narrator). Down at the Paizo booth, setup proceeded more cleanly than\
  \ ever, and I had the pleasure of meeting many of you either as you stopped by to\
  \ pick up your playtest materials or when I wandered around the Sagamore Ballroom\
  \ to check out the action. For all of the good times, this Gen Con was my first\
  \ in memory where I felt an impending illness by the end of the convention, so if\
  \ I was a little scatterbrained when talking to you on the last two days, I was\
  \ probably also a little fuzzy from managing my health. My biggest regret? Gen Con's\
  \ such a big, busy production that I rarely get a chance to actually play the game\
  \ I work on, so I appreciate getting to run the occasional demo that weekend and\
  \ hearing about your experiences.</p>\n      </div>\n     </div>\n     <p></p> \n\

  >\n      <div class=\"spoiler-text\"> \n       <p>Gen Con 2018 was a really exciting\
  \ convention for me on a few fronts. Growing up in Alaska, I never made it to conventions\
  \ that weren't on the west coast, so this was actually my first Gen Con. While working\
  \ the Paizo booth left me wishing I had more time to go check out all the other\
  \ awesome booths and products in the show, it also gave me a lot of opportunities\
  \ to interact with our customers one-on-one and get to hear what they thought of\
  \ our various products, including the new Pathfinder Playtest. Getting to talk to\
  \ people face-to-face about the things they liked and didn't like was a great learning\
  \ experience, and it gave me an opportunity to share my own insights and experiences,\
  \ both as Paizo's newest developer and as someone who came to Paizo after working\
  \ as a designer in the 3pp market for classic Pathfinder.</p> \n       <p>I also\
  \ got to check out the Sagamore Ballroom, where the organized play events were happening,\
  \ and wow! I don't know think I've ever seen that many people playing Pathfinder\
  \ in one place at one time. It was a particularly cool experience because I'd been\
  \ the developer on many of the featured scenarios, and I had a few opportunities\
  \ to meander through the room and watch people playing the adventures I'd worked\
  \ on. I don't know that there's any experience quite like hearing people I had never\
  \ met before tell me what a great time they had in an encounter I developed, or\
  \ hearing a GM relay their experiences with an adventure I worked on. It was both\
  \ humbling and gratifying, and I'm so grateful to Paizo and all of the organized\
  \ play volunteers whose efforts allowed it to happen.</p> \n       <p>I'd also be\
  \ remiss if I didn't thank Linda Zayas-Palmer and Ron Lundeen for the awesome Adventure\
  \ Design panel we ran! From talking about pro tips and pitfalls of designing adventures\
  \ to actually brainstorming an adventure with the audience, that was a serious highlight\
  \ of the convention for me. I'm not sure if the audience was swept up in the moment\
  \ or if they were testing our ability to roll with some wild ideas, but I'd actually\
  \ love to sit down and write up our brainstormed adventure about high-level heroes\
  \ recovering a castle made of soul-imprisoning ice from the depths of Hell (nicknamed\
  \ \"Castle H-ice-t\" by me and pretty much nobody else.)</p>\n      </div>\n   \

  \ this milestone, GMs facilitate 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique\
  \ scenarios and 10 are special scenarios, as well as run a game for a venture-captain.\
  \ A conservative estimate of time needed to reach 5-stars is 650 hours! To the GM\
