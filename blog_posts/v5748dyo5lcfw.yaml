  \ on the western coast of Minkai, Reiko’s home town of White Wave was a quiet fishing\
  \ village, little more than a collection of shacks and cabins clinging to a steep\
  \ cliff face overlooking the harbor. Crushed under oppressive humidity in the summer,\
  \ the air thick with clouds of stinging flies and gnats, and subject to dangerous\
  \ storms in the winter, White Wave had little to offer any lord, and thus little\
  \ was demanded of it.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PZO1118-Ninja.jpg\"\

  \     <br> Illustration by Wayne Reynolds\n    </div> \n    <p>All that changed\
  \ when Reiko was twelve. Due to bureaucratic disputes and shifting borders between\
  \ noble fiefdoms, White Wave fell under the control of a new lord—Entobe Hisashi—\
  and this one had grand plans for the holding. The sea cliffs would be the perfect\
  \ place for a new shrine, a series of shining towers that would please the gods\
  \ and bring favor upon the Entobe family for generations. An ambitious project,\
  \ it would take many hands to complete. And Lord Entobe knew precisely where to\
  \ find them.</p> \n    <p>When Reiko thinks of her childhood, she no longer remembers\
  \ searching through tide pools, or climbing high up the dangerous cliff walls to\
  \ the sounds of her mother’s laughter and her father’s anxious scolding. Instead,\
  \ she remembers the smell and taste of rock dust in her mouth, her fingernails smashed\
  \ and bleeding from hauling rocks. She remembers the long hours of toil in the cruelly\
  \ hot sun, carrying water for the townsfolk forced to cut stone in the quarry, their\
  \ fishing dories left to rot in the harbor. Yet most of all, she remembers the faces\
  \ of her parents growing steadily leaner as they made her take their rations of\
  \ rice and soup.</p> \n    <p>For many months, the people toiled. Lord Entobe’s\
  \ enforcers brooked no laziness—as they deemed it when the old or young keeled over\
  \ from exhaustion—and punishments were severe. The village’s tiny graveyard filled\
  \ quickly, and soon bodies began to wash up on the shore as townsfolk too exhausted\
  \ to dig graves cast their deceased loved ones into the sea.</p> \n    <p>And then,\
  \ seemingly overnight, the gods turned against the project. Shortly after dusk one\
  \ night, three of the five tower foundations collapsed, killing one of the crueler\
  \ taskmasters. Though it meant months more work, the people secretly took joy in\
  \ the irony, and that joy sustained them as they began to clear away rubble and\
  \ rebuild. Yet strange things kept happening to the necessary supplies. Tools were\
  \ broken. Timbers rotted. Stone turned brittle, and rope frayed and snapped. Guards\
  \ died in mysterious ways, always seemingly accidental. The fury and fear of the\
  \ overseers and the architects was a wonder to behold, and the common folk secretly\
  \ toasted whatever kami were responsible.</p> \n    <p>Only one house did not share\
  \ in the amusement. Though they said nothing to her, Reiko could tell that her parents\
  \ were tense, and the arguments that came through her walls after they thought she\
  \ was asleep ran late into the night. And then one painfully hot summer evening,\
  \ unable to sleep despite her exhaustion, Reiko left her room and found a black-clad\
  \ figure crawling through a second-story window.</p> \n    <p>Before Reiko could\
  \ scream, the figure was at her side, hand covering her mouth. And then the tight-fitting\
  \ black cowl was removed, and Reiko was looking into the solemn eyes of her mother.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>After that night, many things changed. Reiko learned that her mother\
  \ was no shepherd girl from the inland fields, as she had always been told, but\
  \ had instead grown up in the mountains as part of a clan of ninja, a deadly but\
  \ honorable band of assassins and spies with a history going back hundreds of years.\
  \ On the run after an ill-fated ambush, she hid out in the tiny village and fell\
  \ in love with a simple fisherman—Reiko’s father. Despite her husband’s concern\
  \ and disapproval, Reiko’s mother began to teach their daughter some of the secrets\
  \ of the clan. Though she flatly refused to take Reiko on any of the solitary raids\
  \ with which she plagued Entobe’s people, the two spent many hours together in the\
  \ darkness, climbing the cliffs of White Wave, practicing with the swords her mother\
  \ kept hidden in their rafters, and moving silently across rooftops and ship rigging.\
  \ Reiko proved a capable student, and at last there was something to look forward\
  \ to after days of backbreaking labor.</p> \n    <p>And then Reiko’s mother went\
  \ too far. Caught in the act of sabotaging a stone-hauling cart, she killed several\
  \ of the overseers before escaping back to their home. Immediately she hid her gear\
  \ in the midden and put an end to her and Reiko’s midnight activities. But it was\
  \ too late.</p> \n    <p>Furious, Lord Entobe himself came to the site, arriving\
  \ in a grand procession of warriors, spellcasters—and investigators. The afternoon\
  \ after his arrival, he halted construction and ordered the townsfolk to assemble.\
  \ Reiko and her mother—both assigned to the task of serving tea to the guards for\
  \ the day—stood at the back of the crowd, watching Entobe take the makeshift stage\
  \ that had been erected in his honor.</p> \n    <p>Addressing the crowd, Entobe\
  \ announced that the person behind the attacks had been discovered, and that the\
  \ treachery in their midst would be ending. Then he held up a familiar object—the\
  \ black mask belonging to Reiko’s mother, still damp and stained from the trash\
  \ heap.</p> \n    <p>That was when the guards parted ranks to reveal Reiko’s father,\
  \ bound at wrists and ankles. There was no mistaking the gash across his throat,\
  \ nor the red stain trailing down his shirt.</p> \n    <p>Reiko shrieked and rushed\
  \ forward, but her mother caught her shoulder and spun her around. Their eyes met.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>“Run, little spider,” her mother said. Then a hidden blade dropped from\
  \ her sleeve into her hand, and she leapt for the mob of guards on the stage.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Reiko ran. Using all the skills her mother had taught her, she slipped\
  \ out of the village and away down the cliffs, evading Entobe’s guards and dogs.\
  \ For days she ran along the sea’s edge, keeping to the stones at low tide to leave\
  \ no prints or scent trails, until she was sure that she was far from Entobe’s holdings.\
  \ Then she turned east, into the mountains, in search of her mother’s clan.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>In the end, she found them—yet not in the way she expected. For Entobe\
  \ had also uncovered her mother’s clan allegiance, and in a fit of pique had hired\
  \ them to hunt down any remaining members of her family. One again, Reiko found\
  \ herself on the run. And this time she didn’t stop until she was far, far to the\
  \ west, on the shores of a strange land called Avistan.</p> \n    <p>Today, Reiko\
  \ is a grown woman. Cool and aloof, quick with a cutting remark or withering glare,\
  \ she’s nevertheless managed to get along for nearly ten years in a land where Minkai\
  \ itself is a legend, and ninja are little more than exotic fairy tales. Though\
  \ she’s studied with the most capable thieves and assassins in the region, Reiko\
  \ has yet to find the carefully codified engagements of honor and subtlety that\
  \ her mother spoke of, and grows tired of Avistan’s seemingly endless collection\
  \ of brute highwaymen and lowbrow killers. Still, the lack of corrupt lords like\
  \ Entobe in places like Andoran—her new nation of choice—is a small comfort, and\
  \ she’s heard whispers that a secret branch of the Eagle Knights may be exactly\
  \ what she’s looking for. Regardless of whether such rumors pan out, and despite\
  \ a decade on foreign soil, Reiko still views her time around the Inner Sea as a\
  \ training exercise. Someday soon, she’ll retrace her steps back to Minkai. And\
  \ when she does, both the Entobe family and her mother’s traitorous clan will finally\
  \ learn the magnitude of their mistake.</p> \n    <p>Liz Courts<br> <i>Webstore\
