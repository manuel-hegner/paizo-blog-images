  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n     </div> \n     <p><span itemprop=\"description\">Ahoy,\
  \ landlubbers! I'm Gaby, one of Mike's developers on the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame\"\
  >Pathfinder Adventure Card Game</a>. I'd be remiss if I didn't begin by thanking\
  \ you all for your support of the game. Thanks to you, the game is doing so well\
  \ that we're already working on another set! Developing this game has been a total\
  \ blast, and it's been so much fun to watch everyone enjoy something I got to help\
  \ create.</span></p> \n     <p>If you haven't guessed from the awesome Daryl Mandryk\
  \ cover art, the new set is going to be adapted from the popular <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/skullAndShackles\"\
  >Skull &amp; Shackles Adventure Path</a>! A private playtest is starting soon, and\
  \ the game will launch at Gen Con Indy in August of 2014. So, now that the catfish\
  \ is out of the bag, what exactly is there to look forward to in the Skull &amp;\
  \ Shackles set of PACG?</p> \n     <p><b>New character classes</b>: We're bringing\
  \ seven new character classes from the Pathfinder RPG to the Pathfinder ACG. The\
  \ Oracle, Gunslinger, Magus, and Swashbuckler will debut in the <a href=\"/products/btpy92zj?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Skull-Shackles-Base-Set\"\
  >Skull &amp; Shackles Base Set</a>, along with the returning Bard, Fighter, and\
  \ Rogue. The <a href=\"/products/btpy92zk?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Skull-Shackles-Character-AddOn-Deck\"\
  >Skull &amp; Shackles Character Add-On Deck</a> will introduce the Alchemist, Witch,\
  \ and Warpriest, along with the Druid. (Not familiar with the Swashbuckler or the\
  \ Warpriest? They appear in the upcoming Pathfinder RPG Advanced Class Guide—check\
  \ tomorrow's Paizo blog for more on that!)</p> \n     <p><b>Guns</b>: There's going\
  \ be a Gunslinger, so we'd better have some guns for her to sling. Big guns, little\
  \ guns, sneaky guns! Pew pew pew!</p> \n     <p><b>Pirates</b>: Now with piratical\
  \ accessories! Our pirates may be helpful or they might be the sort of scallywags\
  \ who will make you walk the plank. Your character may even be a pirate! Of course,\
  \ pirates need pirate gear, so you can expect to find eye patches, tricornes, and\
  \ the like.</p> \n     <p><b>Sharks</b>: Dunnn dunn.… dunnn dunn… dunnndunnndunnndunnndundundundundundun.\
  \ Being that I work at Lone Shark Games, I'm pretty stoked about sharks appearing\
  \ in this game.</p> \n     <p><b>Ships</b>: It's pretty hard to have adventure on\
  \ the high seas without ships, so there might be a ship or two in this set. But\
  \ watch out: there might also be some sea monsters that like fish and ships.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>Booty</b>: I don't want to say too much, but we're definitely going\
  \ to have some pirate booty in this game. It'd be wrong not to.</p> \n     <p><b>Swashbuckling</b>:\
  \ Many times, your character will be swashbuckling. Sometimes that will help you\
  \ and sometimes it won't. The pirates you meet will care quite a bit about whether\
  \ or not your buckles are swashed.</p> \n     <p><b>New challenges</b>: With new\
  \ adventures come new challenges. Ships and seas are full of perilous and rewarding\
  \ tasks. (Protip: I just told you a new type of barrier.)</p> \n     <p><b>Sharks</b>:\
  \ Did I mention sharks? There are going to be a lot of sharks.</p> \n     <p>There\
  \ are a couple other very exciting aspects to PACG: Skull &amp; Shackles. First,\
  \ you'll be able to play Rise of the Runelords characters in Skull &amp; Shackles\
  \ and vice versa. Yeah, we're totally backwards compatible. Second, Adventure Decks\
  \ will be released MONTHLY, which means less waitin' and more keelhaulin'! And don't\
  \ forget the part where you can save money! <a href=\"/products/btpy8x6n?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Subscription\"\
  >Pathfinder Adventure Card Game Subscribers</a> get 20% off of MSRP, free promo\
  \ cards, and discounts on Ultrapro's upcoming PACG <a href=\"/products/btpy918a?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Character-Mats-Base-Set\"\
  >character mats</a> and other Ultrapro PACG accessories yet to be announced!</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Stay tuned in the coming months for more news about PACG: Skull &amp;\
  \ Shackles! Here's hoping you and your salty crew have smooth sailing ahead!</p>\
