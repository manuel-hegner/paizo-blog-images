  ></a>\n   </div> \n   <h1 itemprop=\"headline\">The Rusty Dragon Inn is Open for\

  articlebody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Welcome to the first 2016 edition\
  \ of the Friday Publisher Preview, where I show off upcoming Paizo releases, usually\
  \ (but not always!) for the <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder Battles</a>\
  \ line of prepainted plastic gaming figures. While I don't have any brand new images\
  \ of upcoming miniatures to show this week, I do want to pop the cork off a bottle\
  \ of champagne and celebrate the official release of <a href=\"/products/btpy9er4\"\
  ><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a>, the latest set!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160108-RDI-1.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160108-RDI-1_500.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>The occasion allows me the chance to update folks on\
  \ a number of items related to the release of <a href=\"/products/btpy9er4\"><em>The\
  \ Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a>.</p> \n    <h2>Singles Sales</h2> \n    <p>\n     <link>Single\
  \ figures from the set are on sale now here at paizo.com. We're changing the way\
  \ we stock and sell single figures for the foreseeable future, starting with <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy9er4\"><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a>. Henceforth Paizo\
  \ will be stocking significantly fewer singles for all new sets, with sales lasting\
  \ as long as our limited supplies last. Singles sales of <a href=\"/products/btpy9er4\"\
  ><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a> on paizo.com will cease at the end of January.\
  \ It's possible that some will re-appear later, but these will be figures cycled\
  \ through the secondary market rather than from a vast supply that we keep in our\
  \ warehouse. If you prefer to snipe the handful of figures you want as singles rather\
  \ than buying boosters, bricks, or cases, be aware that you're going to have to\
  \ act more rapidly than you're used to in order to get the figures you want. We\
  \ MAY restock singles during January, but after that the entire set will be removed\
  \ from singles sales indefinitely.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a\
  \ href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160108-RDI-2.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160108-RDI-2_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> <a href=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160108-RDI-3.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160108-RDI-3_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <h2>Feiya and King Irovetti Replacements</h2> \n    <p>WizKids\
  \ has taken the opportunity of this set's release to re-release repainted versions\
  \ of two figures that did not match their quality control standards from previous\
  \ sets, namely King Irovetti from <a href=\"/products/btpy909j\"><em>Legends of\
  \ Golarion</em></a> and Feiya, Human Witch from <a href=\"/products/btpy92s9\"><em>Reign\
  \ of Winter</em></a>. These figures are repainted versions of the same sculpts,\
  \ with improved paint application from their previous versions. WizKids has packed\
  \ both replacement figures into a single unmarked \"super-booster\" in each case\
  \ of <a href=\"/products/btpy9er4\"><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a>. The two figures\
  \ are in addition to the four regular figures in each booster, totaling six figures\
  \ per \"super-booster.\"</p> \n    <p>If you're already an <a href=\"/products/btpy8o6b\"\
  ><em>ongoing Pathfinder Battles case subscriber</em></a>, you need do nothing to\
  \ receive these two free replacement figures. Customers buying a full case of <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy9er4\"><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a> will likewise receive\
  \ the super-booster. As usual with these sorts of things, collation is not guaranteed.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>If you own an unsatisfactory original version of Feiya or King Irovetti\
  \ but are not currently an <a href=\"/products/btpy8o6b\">ongoing Pathfinder Battles\
  \ case subscriber</a> you can receive a replacement figure direct from WizKids through\
  \ their <a href=\"http://wizkidsreplacementsystem.com\" target=\"_blank\">standard\
  \ figure replacement system</a>.</p> \n    <p>We've listed a small number of the\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9iyg\">Feiya</a> and <a href=\"/products/btpy9iyh\">King\
  \ Irovetti</a> repainted figures for purchase as singles on paizo.com.</p> \n  \
  \  <div class=\"blurb180\">\n     <a href=\"/products/btpy9iyi\"><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK72052-8-47-PR_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <h2>Beds, Beds, Beds!</h2> \n    <p>Lastly this week, when\
  \ I saw the amazing dungeon dressing figures for this set come through approvals,\
  \ I knew GMs would want more than the number of beds they were likely to get in\
  \ their cases. As a result, we had WizKids create a special promotional version\
  \ of the bed figure with a blue bedspread (rather than the standard red). These\
  \ promo beds were produced in very limited quantities. Once they're gone, they're\
  \ gone for good. <a href=\"/products/btpy9iyi\">You can get as many as you'd like\
  \ (for now) here.</a></p> \n    <p>And that's it for this week. I'm quite pleased\
  \ with the few boosters of <a href=\"/products/btpy9er4\"><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a>\
  \ I've opened so far, and look forward to diving into the rest of my personal case\
  \ this weekend! I hope to be back next week with some news to reveal. The next set\
  \ is even better than this one!</p> \n    <p>See you then!</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br>\
