  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Paizo has a long history\
  \ of supporting our games with robust adventure content: Adventure Paths, Organized\
  \ Play scenarios, single volume modules, and more. All of these adventures have\
  \ one thing in common: they have a clear story, and while every GM changes an adventure\
  \ to suit their table, my role as a developer has been to give both GM and players\
  \ a complete story with a beginning, middle, and end that rises to a satisfying\
  \ finale. But what if that’s not the kind of adventure you like to run or play in?\
  \ What if you want something more open… where the players can go where they want,\
  \ making the story up themselves as they explore and interact with newly-discovered\
  \ NPCs and mysterious creatures? What if you want to leave the “theme park” style\
  \ adventure for something more like a “sandbox”?</p> \n     <p>I’m very happy to\
  \ say: the <em>Starfinder Galaxy Exploration Manual</em> is the book you’ve been\
  \ waiting for.</p> \n     <p>When Joe Pasini, lead developer of the <em>Galaxy Exploration\
  \ Manual</em>, asked me to write the Sandbox Adventures chapter for this book, I\
  \ was both excited and intimidated. Making a sandbox campaign is a tremendous logistical\
  \ challenge, but it’s also highly rewarding—as any of you who have played in sandbox\
  \ games can attest. And because sandbox-style games have a long history in our hobby,\
  \ there’s a lot of advice on this topic out there already, much of it written by\
  \ simply brilliant creators. My job was clear: to take the best of that advice and\
  \ then fine-tune it to the unique qualities and attributes of the Starfinder RPG.</p>\

  \ 13px;\"></p>\n     </div> \n     <p>To take one example, Ray Winninger’s <em>Dungeoncraft</em>\
  \ series of essays (originally published in Dragon magazine from 1997—1999) is packed\
  \ with great advice on making sandbox settings and adventures. In those articles\
  \ Winninger created an entire fantasy setting from scratch, just to show us all\
  \ how it is done (and then, when he was finished, he went back to the beginning\
  \ and did it again, an effort only interrupted when Paizo began to publish Dragon).\
  \ You’ll see some of Winninger’s advice—like giving every NPC, location, and object\
  \ you create for your setting a secret which the PCs can discover—in the <em>Galaxy\
  \ Exploration Manual</em>. But not all advice is useful for every RPG; when discussing\
  \ the ideal number of players a GM should recruit, Winninger suggested, “you'll\
  \ want to limit yourself to eight or ten players as a general rule.” Some RPGs work\
  \ great with 8-10 players, but Starfinder isn’t really designed for that; all our\
  \ advice on encounters and challenge rating is based around groups half that size—\
  and many of us have trouble finding even four players, let alone 10! </p> \n   \
  \  <p>Ron Lundeen—whom most of you already know as a developer on Pathfinder and\
  \ author of many adventures for both that game and Starfinder—also lent me his experience\
  \ and knowledge. Ron has written extensively about the incredible challenge that\
  \ sandbox games present to GMs; a GM can easily fall into the trap of thinking they\
  \ have to prepare every possible location the player characters might go, and that\
  \ level of preparation takes so long that the game itself never happens. And if\
  \ this is a challenge in a fantasy RPG where characters are limited to wherever\
  \ their horses or ships can take them, imagine how much worse the problem becomes\
  \ when the PCs have a Drift engine, and any planet in the galaxy is only a single\
  \ Drift jump away! How does the GM prepare, when the PCs can go anywhere?</p> \n\
  \     <p>The answer is, of course, “they don’t.” Instead, the GM gates some adventure\
  \ locations behind other locations, nesting one sandbox inside the next. So, for\
  \ example, the PCs might be exploring an ancient alien ruin—their first sandbox—\
  when they discover coordinates to other ruins on the other planets in the star system,\
  \ worlds they had no reason to visit… until now. And the GM can steer the PCs by\
  \ making some adventure locations obviously more hazardous or more difficult to\
  \ get to—which will probably prompt the players into putting those locations off\
  \ for a while, at least until they gain a level or two. The players still have plenty\
  \ of choices; in fact, by reducing the choices from “an infinite galaxy” to something\
  \ like three or four—and giving those remaining choices some specific details that\
  \ the PCs can rely on to make informed choices—the GM can actually help the players\
  \ avoid decision paralysis. Any Paizo designer will tell you: sometimes too many\
  \ choices is as bad, or worse, than no choices at all. And then, when the players\
  \ do decide where to go, you can use the tools in the <em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em>\
  \ (perhaps with a little assist from the <em>Deck of Many Worlds</em>) to actually\
  \ make those settings, often with help from your own players!</p> \n     <p>Beyond\
  \ advice for how to create basic sandbox-storytelling structures for your game,\
  \ there’s so much more in this chapter of the <em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em>.\
  \ You’ll find advice on reskinning creatures—so even if you’re creating a brand\
  \ new setting, you don’t have to create all the alien creatures yourself—and how\
  \ to get started, by creating a home base with a steady cast of NPCs whom the PCs\
  \ can go to for healing, crafting, and pawning their loot. Our game is unique in\
  \ its particular combination of science and fantasy, so there’s advice for combining\
  \ both in your setting to make it really feel like Starfinder. You’ll even find\
  \ advice on building random encounter tables; we don’t use random encounters much\
  \ in Starfinder Adventure Paths or modules, because they’re a bit antithetical to\
  \ the structure of an Adventure Path. It’s hard to predict what level the PCs will\
  \ be at any given point in an adventure if the PCs are having random encounters\
  \ and gaining a variable amount of XP. But random encounters are key to sandbox\
  \ adventures, where the PCs level up at their own pace and can often find themselves\
  \ facing creatures far too deadly for the group’s level. </p> \n     <p>The <em>Galaxy\
  \ Exploration Manual</em> shows you how all of these tricks work by providing specific\
  \ examples: a sandbox setting called the Alqet system, built from the ground up\
  \ for this book. Alqet’s got NPCs, secrets, clues to those secrets, multiple adventure\
  \ sites, sandboxes nested inside other sandboxes, and even a random encounter table.\
  \ Sidebars walk you through the creation of Alqet one step at a time, a blueprint\
  \ for you to use as you create your own sandbox campaign</p> \n     <p>But that’\
  s not all! We added support for other genres too, from cyberpunk and hard sci-fi\
  \ to high science fantasy settings like <em>She-Ra</em> or <em>Masters of the Universe</em>.\
  \ You’ll find advice on building settings, campaigns, and adventures for military\
  \ sci-fi, post-apocalyptic stories, parallel worlds and time travel, space westerns,\
  \ and even planetary survival stories like <em>The Martian</em>. Some of these genres\
  \ are more suited to sandbox adventures than others, but Starfinder can do them\
  \ all!</p> \n     <p>And I can’t wait for you to read it.</p> \n     <p style=\"\
