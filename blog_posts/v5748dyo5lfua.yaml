  \ Preview: Short and Sweet</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Friday, February 7, 2014</p>\
  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">It's\
  \ been a crazy busy week here at Paizo, so in deference to my overloaded schedule\
  \ I hope you'll forgive a relatively brief set of previews this week. These figures\
  \ are from May's <a href=\"/products/btpy92s9\">Reign of Winter</a> set of <a href=\"\
  /pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids\">Pathfinder Battles</a> prepainted fantasy\
  \ miniatures.</span></p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71459_Owl_500.jpeg\"\
  > <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71459_Owl_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Folks have been asking for more animals for quite\
  \ some time, and I'm happy to say that the <a href=\"/products/btpy92s9\">Reign\
  \ of Winter</a> set delivers. This Owl is a Small, common figure. </p> \n    <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71459_NazenhaVasilliovna_500.jpeg\"\
  > <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71459_NazenhaVasilliovna_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Owls are common familiars of winter witches,\
  \ and here we have the winter witch Nazenha Vasilliovna, straight from the cover\
  \ of <a href=\"/products/btpy8wfl\">Pathfinder Adventure Path #68</a>. Nazenha is\
  \ a major villain in the campaign, but she also works as any female human spellcaster\
  \ or even a player character. Her icicle crown, wand, and sickle blade are all cast\
  \ in clear plastic. Nazenha Vasilliovna is a Medium figure slated at the rare rarity.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71459_Goat_500.jpeg\"\
  > <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71459_Goat_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>This is a Goat. It's a Small, common figure.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71459_RadosekPavril_500.jpeg\"\
  > <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71459_RadosekPavril_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>And here we have the goat's owner, the\
  \ witch Radosek Pavril. Pavril is a servant of Nazenha, so all four of this week's\
  \ characters likely spend a lot of time together. As a villain in the very first\
  \ adventure in the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/reignOfWinter\">Reign of\
  \ Winter Adventure Path</a>, Pavril is sure to hector and annoy your player characters.\
  \ He will probably not get their goat, however, as he already has one. Radosek Pavril\
  \ also has an icicle wand cast in clear plastic. He's a Medium, uncommon figure\
  \ with quite a lot of versatility. </p> \n    <p>And that's it for this very, very\
  \ busy and hectic week. On a side note, you may have noticed that our partners at\
  \ WizKids announced a partnership with another fantasy RPG company today, and that\
  \ they plan to release miniatures for that line as well. We have known about this\
  \ for a while here at Paizo, and have no reason to assume that this new development\
  \ will have any impact on the Pathfinder Battles line, which continues to march\
  \ forward.</p> \n    <p>Onward and upward, and have a great weekend, everybody!</p>\
