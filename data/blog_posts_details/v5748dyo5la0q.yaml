  artist: "President Abraham Lincoln, November 19, 1863, after a two-hour fusillade\
    \ of yowling by the Right Abominable Statesman, Senator Everett OrYARRadoogOOch'ook!ook!:\
    \ Four score and seven yetis ago, our fathers discovered on the northern fringes\
    \ of this continent a new breed of soldier, conceived in the Belly of Hell, and\
    \ dedicated to the proposition that not only men are created equal. Now we are\
    \ engaged in a rarely civil war, testing whether those yetis, or any yetis, so\
    \ ill-conceived and so odiferous, can long be endured. We are met on a great charnel\
    \ house of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final\
    \ resting place for those who here gave their lives that those yetis might be\
    \ once again returned to Canada. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should\
    \ do this, for they do us no good at all here. But, in a larger sense, we can\
    \ not dedicate—we can not consecrate—we can not even find—this ground. The brave\
    \ yetis, living and dead, who struggled here, have pretty much torn it to ribbons,\
    \ far above our poor power to reconstruct. The yetis will little note, nor long\
    \ remember what we say here, as they have the attention span of a chamberpot.\
    \ It is for us the humans, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished collection\
    \ of random soldiers' body parts, which they who fought here have gnawed down\
    \ to the bone. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining\
    \ before us—that"
