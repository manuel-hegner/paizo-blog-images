  \ \n   <p>The goal of this chapter is to give players and GMs a bunch of tools for\
  \ expanding the role of magic in their game, from rules on building and expanding\
  \ constructs to a bunch of new animal companions. It includes a treatise on designing\
  \ spells and rules for conducting duels between spellcasters. While most of these\
  \ will not come up in your everyday play experience, when the time is right, having\
  \ a well-explained system for binding outsiders could become the central focus for\
  \ an entire adventure. One of the new systems we added is called Spellblights. Similar\
  \ to a curse, a spellblight is an affliction that can be contracted by a spellcaster\
  \ upon casting a spell in an area of spellblight or as a product of <i>bestow curse</i>\
  \ or similar magic. Here is just one of the possible spellblights you might contract.</p>\
  \ \n   <blockquote> \n    <p><b>Hemoculysis</b>: A spellcaster with hemoculysis\
  \ bleeds from her eyes whenever she casts a spell. The volume and duration of this\
  \ flow depends on the level of the spell, lasting 1 round per level of the spell.\
  \ While bleeding from the eyes, the spellcaster is considered dazzled and takes\
  \ 1 point of bleed damage. Casting additional spells while the eyes are already\
  \ bleeding resets the duration of existing hemoculysis by the spell level, provided\
  \ it's greater than the current duration. The sight of the spellcaster's eyes bleeding\
  \ is horrifying, and she gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Intimidate checks and\
  \ a –4 penalty on Bluff and Diplomacy checks for the duration of the bleeding.</p>\
  \ \n   </blockquote> \n   <p>As you can see, a spellblight is not something you\
  \ generally want to contract. This chapter contains four pages filled with new familiars,\
  \ including their stat blocks. Take a look at this list.</p> \n   <blockquote> \n\
  \    <table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"8\"> \n     <tbody>\n \
  \     <tr>\n       <th>Familiar</th>\n       <th>Special Ability</th>\n      </tr>\
  \ \n      <tr>\n       <td>Blue-Ringed Octopus</td>\n       <td>Master gains a +3\
  \ bonus on Swim checks </td>\n      </tr> \n      <tr>\n       <td>Donkey Rat</td>\n\
  \       <td>Master gains a +2 bonus on Fortitude saves</td>\n      </tr> \n    \

  \ start<br> and maintain a grapple</td>\n      </tr> \n      <tr>\n       <td>Pig</td>\n\
  \       <td>Master gains a +3 bonus on Diplomacy checks</td>\n      </tr> \n   \
  \   <tr>\n       <td>Scarlet Spider</td>\n       <td>Master gains a +3 bonus on\
  \ Climb checks</td>\n      </tr> \n      <tr>\n       <td>Thrush</td>\n       <td>Master\
  \ gains a +3 bonus on Diplomacy checks</td>\n      </tr> \n      <tr>\n       <td>Turtle</td>\n\
  \       <td> Master gains a +1 natural armor bonus to AC</td>\n      </tr> \n  \
  \   </tbody>\n    </table> \n   </blockquote> \n   <p>There are some fun options\
  \ in that list in terms of mechanics and concept. That said, one of my favorite\
  \ parts of the chapter is the list of premade spellbooks, some of which feature\
  \ preparation rituals, which are special effects a caster gains access to when he\
  \ prepares spells from that spellbook. Take a look at the <i>Book of the Grave</i>.</p>\
  \ \n   <blockquote> \n    <p><b>Book of the Grave (Level 6 Necromancer)</b><br>\
  \ <i>This tome reeks of decomposing flesh or some even fouler stench. Grave mold\
  \ clings to the worm-eaten cover, and dirt stains the pages. Some pages have been\
  \ torn out.</i><br> <b>Protection</b> The edges of the first three pages are coated\
  \ with nitharit poison (contact; <i>save</i> Fort DC 13; <i>frequency</i> 1/minute\
  \ for 6 minutes; <i>effect</i> 1d3 Con damage; <i>cure</i> 1 save).<br> <b>Opposition\
  \ Schools</b> Enchantment, transmutation<br> <b>Value</b> 780 gp (1,230 gp with\
  \ preparation ritual)<br> Spells<br> 3rd—<i>blood biography</i>, <i>ray of exhaustion</i>,\
  \ <i>vampiric touch</i>, <i>vitriol</i><br> 2nd—<i>command undead</i>, <i>create\
  \ treasure map</i>, <i>ghoul touch</i>, <i>spectral hand</i>, <i>stone call</i>,\
  \ <i>web</i><br> 1st—<i>burning hands</i>, <i>chill touch</i>, <i>disguise self</i>,\
  \ <i>mage armor</i>, <i>protection from good</i>, <i>ray of enfeeblement</i>, <i>sculpt\
  \ corpse</i>, <i>shield</i>, <i>true strike</i>, <i>ventriloquism</i><br> 0—standard\
  \ plus <i>penumbra</i><br> Preparation Ritual<br> <b>Breath of the Grave (Su)</b>\
  \ As a swift action, spend this boon's effect to breathe a 15-foot cone of rotting\
  \ stench. Creatures within the cone must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC\
  \ 10 + your highest caster level in a class that prepares spells) or be sickened\
  \ for 1 round. This spends the boon. After this boon has been spent, you take a\
  \ –4 penalty on Diplomacy and Stealth checks until you prepare spells again.</p>\
