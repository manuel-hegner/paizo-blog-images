  \ Iconics: Seltyiel</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Monday, May 26, 2008</p> \n   <div\
  \ itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p>Born from a dead mother amid screams and disgrace,\
  \ this sickly half-elf would never have survived had he fallen into his stepfather's\
  \ waiting arms. In a cruel trick of fate, his half-sister's tears stole the infant\
  \ Seltyiel's chance for a mercifully short life.</p> \n    <p>The bastard son of\
  \ the duped Lady Phiaura Bhrostra and the brigand-sorcerer Lairsaph—the so-called\
  \ Feign Prince of Cheliax's Whisperwood—Seltyiel was never meant to survive. Through\
  \ guile and illusion, the half-elf was conceived as a living disgrace to the sonless\
  \ Bhrostra family—stern, martial-minded traditionalists who had long hunted the\
  \ woodland bandits. The tragedy of his wife's death in childbirth, compounded by\
  \ the dashed promise of a male heir, nearly drove Lord Ghran Bhrostra mad, and only\
  \ his daughter's sobs stayed the lord's blade. For the next 12 years, a continuing\
  \ river of tears ensured the young bastard's life.</p> \n    <p>Raised by his sister\
  \ Sioria, young Seltyiel lived a humiliating fiction. In words, he was Lirt, an\
  \ adopted waif who lived in the light of the Bhrostras' boundless charity. In the\
  \ truths whispered from servant to mocking lord, though, he was living proof of\
  \ Lord Bhrostra's failure as a husband, a lord, and a man. Keenly aware of his family's\
  \ disgrace, Lord Bhrostra frequently reminded his wife's son of his loathing with\
  \ beatings and broken bones.</p> \n    <p>Two weeks before Seltyiel's 13th birthday,\
  \ with the bedridden youth already nursing a thrice-broken arm, a drunk and enraged\
  \ Lord Bhrostra rampaged into the bastard's attic room. The boy could scarcely fight\
  \ against the burly lord and took a fierce beating before reflexively lashing out.\
  \ Catching the unsuspecting lord below the waist, the boy's blow sent Lord Bhrostra\
  \ stumbling backward and tumbling down the steep attic stairs. Seltyiel stared down\
  \ at his stepfather's unconscious body in terror. Without a word to his sister,\
  \ the bloodied and crippled half-elf fled into the Whisperwood that night.</p> \n\
  \    <p>For days, the boy wandered the forest, soaked by rain, slashed by vipervines,\
  \ chased by a boar, and pushed to the brink of starvation. As his continued merciless\
  \ fortune would have it, though, three scowling brigands found the youth. Terrified,\
  \ Seltyiel repeated the name he'd heard Lord Bhrostra curse a thousand times over:\
  \ Lairsaph. Bemused, the scoundrels dragged the boy to his father.</p> \n    <p>Lairsaph\
  \ laughed for nearly an hour after discovering that Lord Bhrostra had actually raised\
  \ his whelp, and in cruel amusement welcomed his son into his camp. The Feign Prince\
  \ gave the boy the name Seltyiel—a corruption of the elven word for malicious humor—\
  and turned his mind to finding a use for the youth. In the weeks following his son's\
  \ arrival, the sorcerer made several cruel attempts to coax forth some evidence\
  \ of the boy's inborn arcane ability. Despite his efforts, though, it swiftly became\
  \ apparent that his son possessed none of the brigand lord's sorcerous blood. Disgusted,\
  \ Lairsaph dismissed Seltyiel, relinquishing him to the ranks of his craven, sycophantic\
  \ followers.</p> \n    <p>For the next decade, Seltyiel scraped out a life among\
  \ the thieves of the Whisperwood. Pale, morose, and slight of frame, he suffered\
  \ endless abuses at the hands of his father's gang, and as Lairsaph and his men\
  \ grew rich off brigandry and violent raids, the half-elf performed menial tasks\
  \ and scavenged from scraps. Gradually, though, as the boy grew into a young man,\
  \ he cultivated a quiet intellect and began collecting the objects his father and\
  \ his men discarded—typically the letters, ledgers, and books of the merchants they\
  \ preyed upon. Slowly he taught himself to read, first Taldane, then other languages.\
  \ As he neared his 20th birthday, he made his greatest discovery amid a treasure-stripped\
  \ caravan wagon: a tattered tome, a book of simple magic. Seltyiel became obsessed.\
  \ For years, the bastard read the tome over and over, learning its runes, memorizing\
  \ its symbols, and gaining some measure of control over the cantrips within. </p>\
  \ \n    <p>In the half-elf's 23rd year, Lairsaph and his men made a daring robbery,\
  \ stealing a fully-loaded taxwagon headed back to Egorian from the Majestrix's eastern\
  \ holdings. Although cunning, the brigand lord was unprepared for the infernal queen's\
  \ swift reprisal and the skill of her hunters. A half-legion of Chelish soldiers\
  \ led by an Order of the Rack Hellknight tracked Lairsaph to his hidden camp and\
  \ turned an evening's debauchery into a night of fire and blood. The swift attack\
  \ scattered the Feign Prince's men, making them easy pickings for the merciless\
  \ soldiers. In a blur of shouts and slashing blades, Seltyiel found himself fleeing—\
  to his shock—at his father's side. Through the night, war hounds and the tenacious\
  \ Hellknight pursued the father and son. Lairsaph exhausted every spell he could\
  \ conjure attempting to stymie the ironclad hunter, but still the infernal knight\
  \ came. Finally, knowing his capture would mean a lengthy torture followed by a\
  \ dramatic execution, Lairsaph turned to his son, drew him close, and, with the\
  \ butt of his spear, shattered Seltyiel's kneecap.</p> \n    <p>Knowing only that\
  \ the criminals of the Whisperwood were led by an elf, the Magistrix's men drug\
  \ Seltyiel back to Egorian in chains. For weeks, the half-elf suffered constant\
  \ tortures and arcane assaults to his mind. Gradually, though, his captors accepted\
  \ that he was not the brigand lord Lairsaph, but merely the Feign Prince's dupe.\
  \ Dismissed as just another bandit, he was thrown into a dank Chelish dungeon and,\
  \ for nearly 5 years, left to rot.</p> \n    <p>During Seltyiel's imprisonment,\
  \ the whispers came. Seemingly drifting from the darkness in the depths of his reeking\
  \ cell, they were a cool balm to the fires of his angry wounds and smoldering hatred.\
  \ They reminded him of his fear, his violent youth, his loathing, and betrayal.\
  \ They also told him much: tales of magic more ancient than the gods, paths to lost\
  \ treasures with feckless guardians, and the names of beings who could teach him\
  \ secrets unknown to men. For long years he listened, and his soul turned to steel.\
  \ If he was to ever have anything, he would have to take it himself. He would have\
  \ riches and influence like Lord Bhrosta. He would have respect and fear like Lairsaph.\
  \ He would have revenge.</p> \n    <p>In 4707, Seltyiel was released. Cold and determined,\
  \ he walked from Egorian to Westcrown, murdering two thieves met along the way with\
  \ arcane fire. Using their twice-stolen coin he bought passage on a ship with no\
  \ clue as to its destination. He would kill his fathers, he would have revenge—\
  but first, he would have power. </p> \n    <p>Seltyiel debuts as a pregenerated\
  \ character in volume 13 of Pathfinder.</p> \n    <p>F. Wesley Schneider<br> Pathfinder\
