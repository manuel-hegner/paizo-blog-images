  \ <p class=\"date\">by Stephanie Lorée</p> \n   <h2>Chapter One: Wine Like Blood,\
  \ Blood Like Water</h2> \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"\
  description\">The tip of her longsword carved a channel along the beachhead of Lake\
  \ Encarthan. She dragged the weapon, held it listlessly in her hand. Hers were dark,\
  \ dirtied hands that knew the weight of good steel, the heft of a man's heart. She\
  \ remembered a time when she was clean, though she could not recall the feeling\
  \ of pristine boot soles, nor of a soul unstained.</span></p> \n    <p>The slope\
  \ of the sands made her stagger. To an observer, she might have appeared a poorly\
  \ crafted iron golem, a lurching, jerky warrior inside a black-plated shell. As\
  \ she reached the shoreline, she stumbled to her knees.</p> \n    <p>Rays of sunlight\
  \ glinted off the lake. Ripples rolled slow and heavy around her calves. It was\
  \ too beautiful a sight, too bright a day for what lay behind her, for what she\
  \ and her squadron had done. But that was the way of Druma, to dress atrocity in\
  \ finery and call it good business. She supposed the weather should be no different\
  \ than the Prophets.</p> \n    <p>The surf whispered over her legs, soaking the\
  \ padding underneath through the gaps in her armor. She stayed there as though in\
  \ supplication to the lake, but did not pray to any god. For a servant of the Kalistocrats,\
  \ there was no god above the High Prophet, and no one who cared to hear her pleas.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>She breathed evenly to slow the thrum of her heart. The air tasted of\
  \ fish and copper and death. It lay thick on her tongue like bad wine, but Brea\
  \ drank it down, allowed it to fill her.</p> \n    <p>\"I did this,\" she said.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The water washed the blood from her greaves. Tendrils of red slipped\
  \ through the blue, snaking away from her like streamers in one of her lord's parades.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Her lord, Prophet Deagan Callimedes, would be home now, toiling behind\
  \ his desk. She imagined Deagan's smooth, tawny cheek lifted in a grin. His wide-set\
  \ eyes, bright as winter's sky and just as cold. White-gloved hands cupping her\
  \ face, twined in her hair. The smell of jasmine and rose petals. The faint taste\
  \ of blackberry wine. His mouth.</p> \n    <p>Brea unbuckled her mail. Each section\
  \ splashed as it fell. The sword—forgotten by her busy fingers—sank at her side\
  \ like an offering to a wishing well. When only the arming doublet remained, she\
  \ slumped forward on her hands and watched the blood stain the rhythmic tide. The\
  \ lives she had taken danced in the water's reflection. Her victim's pain echoed\
  \ in the bruises yellowing her olive skin, in the burn of her muscles.</p> \n  \
  \  <p>They'd overridden the so-called brigands at first light. Her heavy cavalry\
  \ had crushed bone and spirit before she called the dismount and began the slaughter.\
  \ She swung her sword like an automaton, slicing through meager armor and severing\
  \ frail limbs. When her arms had wearied, Brea used her armored body as a weapon,\
  \ trampling any in her path.</p> \n    <p>Segments of that mail lingered around\
  \ her now. The black cuirass still glowed a pale gold with the dying embers of magic.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>It, too, had started clean, gleaming fiercely with her lord's blessings.\
  \ When she'd received her promotion to Captain, Brea had been honored to receive\
  \ his gift. The cuirass comforted her, protected her. Through it, Deagan had finally\
  \ demonstrated his love for her.</p> \n    <p>It was her blackjacket. Her albatross.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"I did this for you,\" she told the lake in place of her lord.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Behind her, a man cleared his throat. \"Captain?\"</p> \n    <p>Brea recognized\
  \ Farnick's gruff voice. He had been her lieutenant since the Goblinblood Wars,\
  \ where he lost an ear saving her life. Older than her by two score and half her\
  \ height, Farnick was the only dwarf in her squadron and likely her only friend.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"He'll be pleased, sir.\" His round face drew down despite his words,\
  \ and the ruddy stubble coating his jaw only darkened his expression. In spite of\
  \ his heritage, Farnick kept his head and face shaved. Those whiskers were a testament\
  \ to their hard march to Lake Encarthan.</p> \n    <p>\"He is never pleased,\" she\
  \ said.</p> \n    <p>Farnick grunted. \"We're fortunate then, to focus on battle\
  \ and damned the results. We'll be receiving his ire either way.\"</p> \n    <p>A\
  \ slow smile fought its way to her lips. \"How are the troops?\"</p> \n    <div\

  \  </div> \n    <p>\"Soltez was wounded, bucked from his horse by his own idiocy.\
  \ He'll live. The rest are uninjured and gathering a pyre.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Morale?\"\
  \ she asked.</p> \n    <p>He hesitated and shifted the helm he carried from one\
  \ arm to the other. \"As well as can be expected, sir. We've never run down peasants\
  \ before, think they're not taking well to the idea.\"</p> \n    <p>\"They're not\
  \ alone.\" She pulled herself to her feet and stood before him, drenched and drained\
  \ of will. They exchanged a look that said they understood one another as only those\
  \ who have spilled blood together might. \"I will speak to Lord Callimedes.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Farnick grunted again. \"No, then I doubt he'll be pleased.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>Brea nodded. Remaining in her soaked doublet and riding boots, she strode\
  \ from the water toward her squadron, toward the silent dead. She did not witness\
  \ the final magic fade from her blackjacket, nor hear the sorrowful sigh of its\
  \ passing, but in her bones she felt it die among the waves.</p> \n    <p style=\"\
  text-align: center;\">∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n    <p>They arrived to silence, not fanfare. The\
  \ procession of her bedraggled squadron was nothing for the citizens of Deagan's\
  \ Hold to celebrate, for the dark armor of the Mercenary League heralded only death.\
  \ Above them, the guards manning the battlements nodded in greeting. They, too,\
  \ knew the cold will and hot lash her lord favored. Only the scent of baker's morning\
  \ bread comforted Brea as she led her soldiers home.</p> \n    <p>\"I'll handle\
  \ the squadron,\" Farnick told her as they rode. He had gathered her discarded armor,\
  \ dried it by the pyre, and strapped it securely to Brea's horse. Though the thought\
  \ of wearing the blackjacket again didn't make her happy, she knew it was for the\
  \ best.</p> \n    <p>Deagan would not tolerate such a disregard for his gifts.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Have Etrim see to the horses,\" she said. \"She has a way with them.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Aye. The lass will make a fine trooper one day.\"</p> \n    <p>Brea\
  \ unhooked her belt pouch and tossed it at Farnick. \"Have both the soldiers and\
  \ horses fed well tonight.\"</p> \n    <p>He weighed the pouch in his hand, then\
  \ reached in to withdraw a single coin. It was perfectly round and stamped on the\
  \ front with the profile of their lord.</p> \n    <p>\"He looks nicer in gold,\"\
  \ Farnick said. \"Softer, almost motherly, aye?\"</p> \n    <p>She laughed, but\
  \ said nothing in response. He slipped the coin in the bag and stuck it under his\
  \ breastplate.</p> \n    <p>\"I swear I'll only buy a bit of ale, sir,\" he said.\
  \ \"For the horses, of course.\"</p> \n    <p>They rode the rest of the way in companionable\
  \ quiet, only the clack of horseshoes sounding over the cobblestone street. When\
  \ they neared the barracks, Brea split from her squadron and turned toward her lord's\
  \ keep. She was dirty with grime, her doublet still damp and smelling of mildew.\
  \ Her boots left muddy footprints on priceless rugs as she walked, uncontested,\
  \ to Deagan's office.</p> \n    <p>He did not look up from his desk as she entered,\
  \ but said, \"Is it done?\"</p> \n    <p>A strange sadness colored his voice. He\
  \ stared intently at the stack of papers before him, but Brea noted a rim of red\
  \ around his eyes.</p> \n    <p>\"It is, my lord,\" she said.</p> \n    <p>His head\
  \ lifted as she spoke, and for a moment an emotion she could not name flickered\
  \ across his expression. Then a mask smoothed over his face, cold and calm and always\
  \ assured.</p> \n    <p>\"Brea,\" he said on a sigh. \"Tell me.\"</p> \n    <p>She\
  \ stood stock straight as she gave her report. \"The brigands were found and dispatched.\
  \ They were but ragged men and women, a few families. The wagon taken from your\
  \ caravan has been returned, but its cargo is rotten. Food, my lord. They stole\
  \ only food.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Only food.\" He rose from his desk. \"It is food that\
  \ feeds my citizens; its sale pays my soldiers. Only food bought you that armor.\
  \ Only food keeps my hold profitable.\"</p> \n    <p>She remained motionless as\
  \ he approached. He touched her shoulder briefly and inspected his hand. The white\
  \ glove showed wet and dirty fingertips. His mouth formed a hard line, which only\
  \ made his beauty more severe.</p> \n    <p>\"What would you suggest, Captain?\"\
  \ he asked. \"That I let thieves pillage freely if they are hungry? Let them take\
  \ what is rightfully mine out of pity?\"</p> \n    <p>\"They didn't need to die.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>He raised a single dark brow. \"I did not kill them, soldier. You\
  \ did.\"</p> \n    <p>Brea closed her eyes, her chin dropping. The screams of the\
  \ brigands echoed through her mind. They would not suffer the loss of their goods,\
  \ spoiled or not, nor would they be taken under arrest. A man had shouted that the\
  \ dungeons were a worse death than the sword. His face was clear in Brea's memory,\
  \ thinned by starvation yet too stubborn to die. It was he who had drawn the first\
  \ blade, incited his fellows, but it was her longsword that sank deep in his chest.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"We were under orders,\" she said to the floor.</p> \n    <p>\"And if\
  \ you do not like my orders, then violate your contract and leave.\"</p> \n    <p>Her\
  \ heart lurched, her head rising to meet his pale gaze. No love lay in his eyes\
  \ now, no indication that he had ever looked upon her with more than disdain. Then,\
  \ he sighed and rested his hands on either side of her face.</p> \n    <p>\"Brea,\"\
  \ he whispered as his expression relaxed, the hard planes of his face softening\
  \ into the features of the man she knew, not the Prophet she served.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  My lord?\"</p> \n    <p>He wiped the soot and blood from her cheeks, ruining his\
  \ gloves. \"You are the best of my Blackjackets. My most loyal soldier.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>Instinctively, she tilted into his touch. These were the moments she craved,\
  \ the rare times when he reminded her of why she loved him. She said nothing, too\
  \ afraid a word from her might freeze his sudden warmth.</p> \n    <p>\"I shouldn't\
  \ tolerate your insolence,\" he said without rancor. \"But you are my weakness,\
  \ you do know that? Your heart will be my undoing.\"</p> \n    <p>He kissed her\
  \ slow, tasting of rich wine and promises he could not keep. She lost herself for\
  \ a moment, forgot the blood staining her fingernails and the sweat of battle still\
  \ clinging to her. When he pushed her gently away, she was unsurprised. He went\
  \ to his desk again and opened a drawer. From it he lifted a gorget, black as her\
  \ breastplate but too large for her by half. When he placed it around her neck and\
  \ whispered a word, the armor shrank. It fit snugly against her skin.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>\"For you,\" he said. \"To keep you safe when you leave in the morning for\
  \ the Five Kings Mountains.\"</p> \n    <p>Brea caressed the sleek steel of the\
  \ gorget, her brow furrowing. \"My squadron's only just returned.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  And they should have a good night's rest before setting out at dawn.\" He moved\
  \ away from her, placed his hands on his desk's marble top, and leaned over his\
  \ papers once more. \"There have been reports of goblin settlements. The Five Kings\
  \ are too close to my territory for us to sit idly and do nothing. My caravans may\
  \ be at risk.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Of course, my lord, but there've been no instances\
  \ of goblins living near our borders for years.\"</p> \n    <p>Deagan stared at\
  \ her. The man disappeared, leaving only the Prophet in his white robes. \"I suggest\
  \ you clean up, sleep, and do not test my generosity again this day.\"</p> \n  \
  \  <p>He dismissed her with a wave, and Brea wandered out of his keep. It was not\
  \ her place to question, she knew, but she could taste blackberry wine on her tongue\
  \ and feel the heat of his hands against her skin. She reached for the gorget and\
  \ unclasped it. It fell open in her palms, still sized perfectly to her, and clean,\
  \ so much cleaner than the hands that cradled it.</p> \n    <p>She walked toward\
  \ the barracks, toward her troopers and the news that there would not be time to\
  \ recover. They would march at dawn, and she would discover if this new gorget was\
  \ another way for her lord to show his true affections for her—or if it was little\
  \ more than a slave's collar.</p> \n    <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Coming\
