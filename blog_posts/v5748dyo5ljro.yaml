  \ off the map of the Inner Sea and deep into parts unknown. The folks from the Order\
  \ of the Amber Die recently completed their fifth marathon session of running the\
  \ delightfully creepy <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/strangeAeons\">Strange\
  \ Aeons Adventure Path</a>. I'm going to keep this introduction short and let all\
  \ of you dive right into the action as the Order of the Amber Die recaps their experiences\
  \ with <a href=\"/products/btpy9qcl?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-113-What-Grows-Within\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #113: What Grows Within</em></a>.</p> \n    <p>As\
  \ usual, proceed with caution if you are playing in this campaign, as spoilers abound!</p>\
  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>Author John Compton handed us an experience in this\
  \ marathon that had a horrifically epic feel from the opening hours, and didn't\
  \ let up. We dealt with threats that dwarfed anything we've seen in this Adventure\
  \ Path, perhaps in a dozen campaigns we've played. As this year marked the 30th\
  \ anniversary of Order of the Amber Die, we decided to try for a new record regarding\
  \ the total time spent together during a marathon. Ninty-six hours was our previous\
  \ tally, but we're proud to say that part five of Strange Aeons allowed for a new\
  \ achievement:</p> \n     <ul>\n      <li><b>Adventure</b>: Pathfinder Adventure\
  \ Path #113: What Grows Within</li> \n      <li><b>Marathon Length</b>: 108 hours</li>\
  \ \n      <li><b>Session Hours</b>: 64</li>\n     </ul> \n     <p>For immersion,\
  \ the audio engineers at <a href=\"http://axionstudio.com/#about\" target=\"_blank\"\
  >Axion Studios</a> provided custom sounds of the eerie wind that blew through Neruzavin.\
  \ We also used modeling clay and clumps of foliage to make unique versions of the\
  \ fungal monsters we encountered. Lastly, we employed the author's suggestion for\
  \ enhancing horror in roleplaying games (see John's foreword in \"What Grows Within\"\
  ), by silencing our phones and severely curtailing their usage.</p> \n     <h2>Highlights\
  \ From What Grows Within</h2> \n     <ul>\n      <li>Finding the forgotten city\
  \ of Neruzavin was our first challenge, made more difficult after our gnoll guides\
  \ ditched us and the camels were killed by drakes. Upon surviving our first day\
  \ in that terrible metropolis, the camels might have been better off.</li> \n  \
  \    <li>To earn the respect of an ash giant tribe in control of the Parchlands,\
  \ we had to draw on our skill set from Giantslayer and best a colossal scorpion.\
  \ Their skeptical leader shouted three words that were guaranteed to fire up our\
  \ room: \"Prove your might!\" </li> \n      <li>We tried everything to get answers\
  \ to the mysteries hidden within Neruzavin, including a legend lore spell, a real-time\
  \ harrowing by Erasmus, and a conference with an otyugh tome eater who chomped down\
  \ our scrolls faster than a bag of Doritos.</li> \n      <li>During our daily seance,\
  \ an unknown spirit forced its way into Erasmus and began battling Nissa for control\
  \ of his body. We don't know much about it, or even how to rid Erasmus of it; unfortunately,\
  \ the spirit is beginning to manifest its unpleasant personality, and it suffers\
  \ no rivals.</li> \n      <li>Even our new companion Amrivast, a lammasu paladin,\
  \ wasn't safe from the evil present in Neruzavin. We could do nothing as he struggled\
  \ against its dark influences and eventually abandoned us. The lammasu returned\
  \ later as a fungal abomination, calling himself \"Amrivast the Seeded, herald of\
  \ Xhamen-Dor!\" We didn't want to put him down, but we had to.</li> \n      <li>We\
  \ found the <i>Necronomicon</i>, and even being Elder Mythos rookies we'd heard\
  \ the name before. It didn't help that Quinn was the one who read it—or that Dan\
  \ laughed sadistically while our GM told him its secrets.</li> \n      <li>After\
  \ having our flesh and egos scoured by what our GM told us was a \"flying polyp,\"\
  \ our poor reflex saves began dreading what was around every street corner, if corner\
  \ is even the word. Please, no more polyps.</li>\n     </ul> \n     <div class=\"\

  \ too. Our lawful good companion murdered a man right in front of our eyes. The\
  \ diseased member of a prior expedition to Neruzavin was clearly suffering from\
  \ seedborne consumption, but we hadn't tried everything to save him before Quinn\
  \ acted. It didn't go down easy either—the man screamed while Quinn drove his dagger\
  \ home again and again.</p> \n     <h2>Character Deaths</h2> \n     <p>This marathon\
  \ was as deadly as you'd expect from a semi-final matchup. On our side were stats\
  \ such as Feiya's nine instant kills via <i>flesh to stone</i>, and Erasmus's 142\
  \ points of damage in a single round. On the opposing side were John Compton's twelve\
  \ character deaths scored, with five of them coming from the graveknight inquisitor\
  \ of Rovagug he designed. It's important to note that we had easy access to <i>breath\
  \ of life</i> through Feiya's hex channeling, and Winter carried two in her daily\
  \ complement.</p> \n     <h2>Best Quote From Marathon 5</h2> \n     <p><i>Alahazra</i>\
  \ (during a tense parley with an irritated moon giant): \"I need money. I am negotiating\
  \ with a massive giant, OR WE ARE GOING TO DIE. What do we have?\"</p> \n     <h2>Current\
  \ Situation</h2> \n     <p>We had to make one of the toughest decisions of our Pathfinder\
  \ careers, and it will surely trouble us throughout the last chapter of our story.\
  \ Desperately low on resources, the debate came down to saving the multiverse from\
  \ Hastur, or merely saving Golarion in the present. The vote was 3-2 in favor of\
  \ leaving Golarion behind, forcing our world to face the reviving threat of a Great\
  \ Old One and the polyps we unleashed. Moreover, we had taken the <i>Necronomicon</i>\
  \ away from Quinn and given it to exscinder archons, which meant we would have to\
  \ attempt the Path to the Black Stars occult ritual without a key focus—the ritual's\
  \ costly toll now meant we had only one chance at completing it.</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ result: We're headed to Carcosa and the finals of this AP!</p> \n     <div class=\"\
