  \  </div> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">On the occasion\
  \ of Transgender Awareness Week, we at Paizo want to reaffirm our support for our\
  \ transgender colleagues, creators, and community members. We recognize that we've\
  \ not always been there for our trans community members. While things are rough\
  \ now, we as a company are dedicated to improving and providing a safe space for\
  \ all gamers—especially trans gamers—to play, create, and be part of a thriving\
  \ community where they are not only welcomed but celebrated.</p> \n     <p>We felt\
  \ that this year, we shouldn’t place additional emotional labor upon our trans staff,\
  \ creators, and community to contribute to a blog for Trangender Awareness Week.\
  \ Rather, we wanted to address the issue of transphobia on our forums.</p> \n  \
  \   <p>Many members of the community have noted a high amount of homophobic and\
  \ transphobic posts recently. Let us be clear: these hateful posts are not okay\
  \ under any circumstances, and those who make them will be faced with <b>permanent\
  \ suspension</b> from the forums. Though our customer service department is doing\
  \ their best to keep watch and address moderation flags, it’s clear that the volume\
  \ of moderation needed on the forums in the last few months has meant that the team\
  \ sometimes takes more time than usual to moderate a thread. </p> \n     <p>Transphobia\
  \ is serious and removing it from the forums should take precedence over other more\
  \ routine moderation tasks. Therefore, if you need to report transphobia on the\
  \ forums, please don’t hesitate to contact customer service directly by email at\
  \ customer.service@paizo.com with INTOLERANCE in the subject line. Any such hate\
  \ will be dealt with swiftly and incur a permanent suspension.</p> \n     <p>While\
  \ we realize that combatting discrimination is an ongoing process and this is only\
  \ a small step, we hope that it can begin to make our community forums a place where\
  \ all members of our community feel welcome, and more importantly, safe.</p> \n\
  \     <p>Thank you to our trans community members and other allies who have pushed\
  \ us to be better recently. We hear you, we value you, and we will continue to improve\
  \ ourselves, our games, and our community to earn back the trust we’ve lost. It’\
  s hard to admit that we haven’t been living up to our values, but it’s the right\
  \ thing to do, and we can’t move forward without doing so.</p> \n     <p>Please\
  \ also consider donating to nonprofits benefiting and supporting the trans community—\
  members of our staff recommend <a href=\"http://www.tgijp.org/\" target=\"_blank\"\
  >TGI Justice Project</a> and <a href=\"https://ingersollgendercenter.org/\">Ingersoll\
  \ Gender Center</a>, though there are many great organizations doing the work that\
  \ would value your contribution.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n   </div> <!-- tags:\
