| summary  = A dark landscape, cloudy and tinged in reds and dark purples. Through light mist, low stairs lead up to an imposing gothic cathedral with ornate towers peaking in pointed spires. It dominates the city skyline, with prominent iconography of Asmodeus, including his pentagram religious symbol, displayed in its architecture.
