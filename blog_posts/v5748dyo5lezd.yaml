  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">by Ari Marmell</p> \n   <h2>Chapter Two: Worse Than the\
  \ Disease</h2> \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> <span itemprop=\"description\"\
  ><p>The faintest shower of sleet, scarcely more than an icy fog, began to fall over\
  \ the battlefield that had been the town of Kelbran. Just another instance of the\
  \ peculiar freezes and unnatural weather afflicting eastern Touvette in recent months,\
  \ but this time—as visibility grew cloudy and the churned muck of the earth thickened—\
  it almost seemed a harbinger of the oncoming stranger.</p></span> \n    <p> They\
  \ heard his approach before he appeared; citizens, bandits, corpses—all turned toward\
  \ the clatter and splash of a warhorse thundering across the frost-kissed grass.\
  \ Pounding in from the north, it grew louder, then louder still, until it was joined\
  \ by the wordless cry of a warrior seeking blood.</p> \n    <p> All of which left\
  \ the brigands more than a little bewildered when the mounted figure appeared from\
  \ the <i>west</i>, bursting through the flimsy curtain of sleet in absolute, almost\
  \ phantasmal, silence. Dark of hair, dark of armor, he wielded a massive blade from\
  \ atop a russet stallion that appeared to be all muscle and resentment. The man\
  \ swung his sword with a walloping force that seemed beyond the ability of a normal\
  \ man. Striking like steel lightning, his blade sliced through the mist, hewing\
  \ down foes as the warhorse bulled ahead. Four of the bandits fell, life gushing\
  \ into the soil, before the others could even guess at the unbound fury that faced\
  \ them.</p> \n    <p> Loursa had no idea whom their savior might be, and for the\
  \ moment, she wasn't about to question. Instead, with a cry, she led Kelbran's survivors\
  \ in a renewed attack on their assailants.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\">\n\
  \     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500Loursa.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500Loursa_360.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n     <br>\"Loursa leads Kelbran's survivors against the enemy.\"\
  \n    </div> \n    <p> Even fighting for her life, she couldn't quite take her eyes\
  \ off the stranger. Whoever—<i>whatever</i>—he was, he was no more natural than\
  \ the walking dead, and not merely for his abnormal strength. Blade and bludgeon\
  \ veered at the last instant, sliding past rather than biting into his flesh or\
  \ even the steel protecting it. In his wake, men who had fallen to seemingly nonfatal\
  \ wounds twitched, shuddered, and died all the same. He lashed out with his empty\
  \ hand, as well as his sword, and those he struck fell screaming, limbs withered\
  \ or skin split.</p> \n    <p> Perhaps of greater import than any of his eerie abilities\
  \ was his utter lack of fear. Against one foe or a dozen, living or undead, his\
  \ arm never wavered, his expression never changed. Where even the bravest of Loursa's\
  \ companions hesitated to draw near the bandits' shambling allies, the newcomer\
  \ mercilessly drove his mount to close, his blade filleting desiccated flesh from\
  \ rotting bone.</p> \n    <p> When the last handful of surviving bandits fled into\
  \ the falling sleet, the citizens of Kelbran gave a ragged cheer, Loursa loudest\
  \ of them all.</p> \n    <p> Not the stranger. Apparently unsatisfied still, he\
  \ wheeled his horse and charged after the raiders. Loursa cringed as the din of\
  \ slaughter and unanswered pleas sounded long after the lot of them had disappeared\
  \ from sight.</p> \n    <p> The guard and her neighbors exchanged uncertain glances,\
  \ then set about gathering the wounded. They'd been at it for perhaps five minutes\
  \ when the horse reappeared at a walk. The rider dropped from the saddle, sword\
  \ leaning on one shoulder. As he neared, Loursa could see that nothing about him\
  \ other than that sword seemed to be in any worthwhile shape, and that the sleet\
  \ melting down his skin was probably the nearest he'd come to bathing in weeks.</p>\
  \ \n    <p> \"Draeven,\" he announced in a bored tone, as though common courtesies\
  \ were a burden he could do without. \"Marcov Draeven. Who commands here?\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p> Loursa shrugged. \"I suppose I do, now. My name is Loursa—\"</p> \n\
  \    <p> \"Fine.\" Draeven spun his blade, drove it point-first into the soil and\
  \ left it standing. He stretched, arching his shoulders and craning his neck to\
  \ one side. The resulting crack rivaled a small siege engine. \"Anything to drink\
  \ around here?\"</p> \n    <p> \"I'm sure we can find you something,\" Loursa said\
  \ through clenched teeth. \"I want to thank you for—\"</p> \n    <p> \"Don't. I\
  \ didn't do this for you, and I don't especially want to be here.\" Then, before\
  \ she could reply further, he idly kicked an arm that had, until recently, been\
  \ attached to a shambling corpse. \"Walking dead. I never heard anything about your\
  \ bandit problem being an undead problem.\"</p> \n    <p> \"Neither had we. I think\
  \ this is the first time those—those <i>things</i> appeared. Maybe because Kelbran\
  \ is the first town those bastards couldn't take on their own.\"</p> \n    <p> \"\
  Maybe.\" For the first time, his expression changed, sliding into a nasty grin.\
  \ \"Bet you're wishing about now that you hadn't booted <i>all</i> the clerics,\
  \ aren't you?\"</p> \n    <p> Mutters rippled through the citizens, and Loursa drew\
  \ herself up rigid. \"The churches turned on Touvette. They were a bad element.\
  \ We've been better off since the General ousted them and set up the charities in\
  \ their stead.\"</p> \n    <p> \"Oh, yeah.\" The man allowed his gaze to fall heavily\
  \ upon the moaning, crying wounded. \"I can see that. They look <i>much</i> better\
  \ off.\"</p> \n    <p> \"I appreciate your help, Draeven,\" she said coldly, \"\
  but unless you've been granted a traveling pass, I think maybe it's time you left.\
  \ Or would you rather I escort you to the nearest judge and you can explain to him\
  \ why you're not a spy and shouldn't hang?\"</p> \n    <p> Draeven waved his hand\
  \ dismissively. \"Lost it in battle, I'm afraid. But I have a feeling you'll be\
  \ issuing me a new one shortly, Loursa. Otherwise, you'll never find out who's been\
  \ launching these attacks, and I won't be able to send him to the nearest convenient\
  \ hell. I'm not leaving without an answer. Or that drink.\"</p> \n    <p> \"You\
  \ didn't leave anyone alive who could <i>provide</i> any answers!\"</p> \n    <p>\
  \ Again, Draeven offered that ugly, crooked smile. \"That's not too much of an inconvenience,\
  \ really.\"</p> \n    <p> After a brief and apparently perfunctory examination,\
  \ the foreigner knelt beside a deceased bandit. The man had fallen from a nasty\
  \ slash through his ribs; Loursa grew more and more puzzled as Draeven prodded at\
  \ the corpse's mouth and head. He looked for all the world like a gourmand examining\
  \ a haunch of beef.</p> \n    <p> She grew more bewildered still when Draeven said,\
  \ \"All right, you bastards. Make yourselves useful and get in there.\" Not only\
  \ did it not make sense, but his head was twisted to one side while he spoke, as\
  \ if he addressed neither the dead body nor Loursa herself, but some nonexistent\
  \ entity between them.</p> \n    <p> Loursa staggered, unable to repress a startled\
  \ breath, when the dead man's jaw creaked open of its own accord. Horrified gasps\
  \ and angry murmurs ran through the gathered townsfolk. Loursa wondered briefly\
  \ if some of them weren't actually planning to attack Draeven.</p> \n    <p> She\
  \ listened with rapt attention as they talked, these two unnatural creatures. Draeven\
  \ spoke under his breath, his words intended for the corpse alone. The sounds that\
  \ emerged from the body itself scarcely seemed to be words at all. Soft wheezes\
  \ and croaking whispers, kneaded by dead lips into shapes that only vaguely resembled\
  \ syllables, occasionally wafted to Loursa's ears, but she was too distant to make\
  \ any sense of them. The sleet ceased falling, the wind stilled, and gradually the\
  \ low drone of those voices became the world's only sound.</p> \n    <p> When Draeven\
  \ finally concluded his \"conversation\" and stood, it was all Loursa could do not\
  \ to either draw her sword or back away. Both urges were only strengthened when\
  \ she realized that the man's hair, and the sleeves of his tunic, billowed in the\
  \ unmoving air.</p> \n    <p> \"You know Alvren?\" he asked.</p> \n    <p> \"I—\
  what?\"</p> \n    <p> Draeven sighed. \"Alvren. Do. You. Know it?\"</p> \n    <p>\
  \ \"It's a small hillside community,\" Loursa replied, now definitely leaning more\
  \ toward the \"draw her sword\" option. \"It's about fifteen miles north, on the\
  \ border with Pitax.\"</p> \n    <p> \"Good. Let's go.\"</p> \n    <p> \"Why the\
  \ hell you'd believe I'd go <i>anywhere</i> with you—\"</p> \n    <p> \"Because,\"\
  \ he drawled, \"I need a local to guide me. And like it or not, you owe me for saving\
  \ your hide.\" Then, just as she was drawing breath to retort: \"And we want the\
  \ same thing. At least, I assume so. You <i>do</i> want these raids to stop, right?\
  \ I'm not giving you too much credit, there?\"</p> \n    <p> \"No.\" That single\
  \ word was icier than all the fallen sleet.</p> \n    <p> \"Then can we get moving\
  \ already?\"</p> \n    <p> Spitting curses, more than a few of which called upon\
  \ or profaned gods her people no longer worshiped, Loursa stalked back into Kelbran\
  \ to gather supplies.</p> \n    <p align=\"CENTER\">∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n    <p>The basement\
  \ was pungent with soil and mildew, a stench utterly unconcealed by acrid fumes\
  \ of ceremonial incense. Walls of damp earth bulged, supported by a haphazard array\
  \ of mold-covered wooden beams that sagged, exhausted, under the heavy load. An\
  \ equally rickety staircase slouched up to a trapdoor that was the cellar's only\
  \ exit.</p> \n    <p> Well, its only <i>nonmagical</i> exit.</p> \n    <p> The inhabitants\
  \ of the chamber sat, crouched, or sprawled around the cellar's peculiar centerpiece:\
  \ a circular well of granite, sunk deep into the earth and filled to overflowing\
  \ with filthy, stagnant water. A stone obelisk, rough-surfaced but perfectly cylindrical,\
  \ rose from the precise center of the foul pool. Only if viewed from directly above\
  \ would the peculiar monument appear as a representation of a staring, disembodied\
  \ eye.</p> \n    <p> Ellithir leaned back from the edge and brushed a stray lock\
  \ of hair behind a pointed ear. Over the simple woolen tunic and leggings with which\
  \ her customers in the store above were familiar, she now sported a voluminous black\
  \ tabard, torn ragged around the hems. \"Well, sisters.\" She waved idly at the\
  \ images that were only now fading from the pool. \"What do we make of this?\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p> \"Death swaddles him.\" This from a figure hunched in the shadows across\
  \ the dark water, a silhouette that might or might not have been human. Her voice\
  \ was dull, monotonous, like a woman entranced. \"An infant's blanket and a burial\
  \ shroud, both at once. He walks with ghosts. They ride him, as a stallion newly\
  \ broken.\"</p> \n    <p> \"Yes, dear, I think we all got that.\" It was a third\
  \ who spoke now, a long and lanky shape whose height and proportion, though generally\
  \ humanoid, were clearly anything <i>but</i> human. \"I could barely see the morsel,\
  \ for all the phantom energies swirling about him. But I believe our sister's <i>point</i>\
  \ was that we ought really to decide what to <i>do</i> about him.\"</p> \n    <p>\
  \ \"More or less what I meant, yes,\" Ellithir said. \"We didn't plan for anyone\
  \ like him, but we knew <i>someone</i> would interfere eventually.\" The coven had\
  \ summoned a host of foul creatures through a variety of spells—some far worse than\
  \ the undead Khydol had raised—and set them loose along the highways of Touvette.\
  \ They'd kept the General's knights nicely distracted from the bandits, but the\
  \ coven knew well that their diversions couldn't last indefinitely.</p> \n    <p>\
  \ \"Do we call it done, then, dearie? Leave the cleric and his thugs to their fate?\
  \ The bloodshed's already been heavier than we could have demanded. Perhaps we've\
  \ accomplished enough for now.\"</p> \n    <p> \"The priest's wrath rages hot, still,\"\
  \ the other shadowed woman droned. \"We can burn plenty more, before the conflagration\
  \ dies.\"</p> \n    <p> Ellithir nodded. \"I'll send a warning to Khydol, making\
  \ sure he thinks the message came from some supposed ‘survivor' of the Kelbran battle.\
  \ He and the rest of Zarred's bandits should be more than enough for this newcomer,\
  \ once they know he's coming.\"</p> \n    <p> The larger figure shifted, stretching.\
  \ \"And if they're <i>not</i> enough?\"</p> \n    <p> \"Mm. Can the two of you assist\
  \ me in renewing the weather magics before you depart? Wouldn't do to have the ‘\
  punishment of the gods' suddenly let up.\"</p> \n    <p> \"Those spells shouldn't\
  \ require renewing until the day after tomorrow.\"</p> \n    <p> \"No, but I intend\
  \ to be busy for the next few days. Contingencies, in case—as you suggest—Khydol\
  \ and Zarred don't come through. One way or another, ghosts or no, it behooves us\
  \ to ensure that this Draeven is just another corpse on the pile.</p> \n    <p>\
  \ \"The flesh is filth, my sisters,\" she concluded, her tone abruptly formal, ritualistic.\
  \ \"The world is pain. To see is to hate.\"</p> \n    <p> From the others, in unison,\
  \ \"And the Hag sees all.\"</p> \n    <p align=\"CENTER\">∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n    <p><i>Slipping,\
  \ Marcov, you wretched fool. Should have known this was too easy...</i></p> \n \
  \   <p> Should have known—and would have known, only a few years ago, when his arm\
  \ and eye were honed by a life behind the sword. Before the fury and frustration.\
  \ Before the drink.</p> \n    <p> Before the ghosts.</p> \n    <p> They'd reached\
  \ Alvren quickly enough, stopping only for a few hours to rest up after the battle\
  \ at Kelbran. It proved an easy journey, over open fields with only the occasional\
  \ rolling hill, and often across trails tramped flat by years of passing feet, human\
  \ and animal alike.</p> \n    <p> And they'd taken every precaution. Marcov had\
  \ learned much from the corpse he'd interrogated. He knew that the bandit leader—\
  named Zarred—had depopulated Alvren and taken it as a base camp for his band. He\
  \ knew there were several dozen men left in that band, but Alvren should house only\
  \ a fraction of them at any given time. He knew the band had been hired by someone\
  \ to make these raids, though presumably only Zarred and his immediate lieutenants\
  \ knew who.</p> \n    <p> What Marcov <i>hadn't</i> known, Loursa had. Familiar\
  \ with the geography and—though he would never deign to admit it—possessed of a\
  \ sharp sense of tactics, she'd planned a nighttime approach that kept them hidden\
  \ behind Alvren's own houses and barns.</p> \n    <p> Between their swords and what\
  \ advantages Marcov could squeeze from the souls who rode him, they'd cut down a\
  \ trio of riders patrolling near the hill, and a pair of sentries at the edge of\
  \ town. They'd been so silent, in fact, that the choir of frogs and crickets—those\
  \ that had survived the recent freeze—hadn't been sufficiently disturbed to cease\
  \ their calls.</p> \n    <p><i>So why, why, after battling a throng of bloody undead,\
  \ was I too stupid to check for magical defenses?</i></p> \n    <p> It had erupted\
  \ from the earth, a blast of thunderous force that shattered the night, nearly deafening\
  \ him even as it hurled him and Loursa from their feet. Soil and splinters rained\
  \ around them, and the world seemed subtly tilted as Marcov struggled to rise.</p>\
  \ \n    <p> Now, cursing himself for an idiot and the phantoms for dragging him\
  \ into this mess, he finally staggered to his feet. One more abrupt lean almost\
  \ sent him sprawling again, and then the earth righted itself enough for Marcov\
  \ to see what he faced.</p> \n    <p> \"Well... shit.\"</p> \n    <p align=\"center\"\
