  >Sighing, Janira puts her quill down, reaching for the cup of tea sitting next to\
  \ her on the desk. Cautiously she takes a sip, testing the temperature before settling\
  \ back into her seat and finishing the cup. “Well, that’s done,” she murmurs at\
  \ the papers before her, before glancing at the stack sitting neatly on the back\
  \ corner of the desk. She sets the empty cup back on its saucer, then picks up her\
  \ quill and retrieves the top paper from the stack. “Once more into the breach,\
  \ old friend. Let’s get this wrapped quickly, so that we can go see how the newest\
  \ initiates fared on the obstacle course. I bet Marcos the newest Envoy’s would\
  \ get through fastest and I want to see if I won.”</p>\n              <h2>AcP and\
  \ GM Credits</h2>\n              <p>We made great strides on resolving the issues\
  \ in the AcP program. The quests are now giving the correct number of points – 1\
  \ per player and 2 per GM – as well as reflecting any bumps for Premier and Premier\
  \ Plus events. Those multiplier bumps levelled out at 1.25 for a Premier event and\
  \ 1.5 for a Premier Plus event. This multiplier goes with the base points for the\
  \ type of adventure being run. So, playing a scenario is usually 4, becomes 5 at\
  \ a Premier event and 6 at a Premier Plus event. Running a scenario earns a GM 8\
  \ points, with 10 points at a Premier event and 12 at a Premier Plus. When you look\
  \ at your My Organized Play page, you will see AcP listed in two columns. The first\
  \ is the base points that type of game earns. The second, on the far right, notes\
  \ the amount of points you earned, ie base times any event multipliers.</p>\n  \
  \            <p>What does this mean for launch? It is imminent. We found one small\
  \ bug – all boons sheets generated by the program awarded them to Org Play #8. We’\
  re pretty sure Linda needs ALL the boons and are working to fix the code so that\
  \ it populates a purchaser’s org play number. Once that change is made, we should\
  \ be good to launch the purchasing.</p>\n              <p>This also means we are\
  \ REMOVING the free rebuild boon from those available. At this point, we plan to\
  \ remove that boon <b>2 weeks</b> after we launch AcP purchases. We will include\
  \ a rebuild boon on the AcP reward chart, but it will cost. If you are planning\
  \ on doing any character rebuilds, I highly encourage you to do so now!</p>\n  \
  \            <p>For those watching, you’ve also seen GM credit appear for Starfinder\
  \ Society games – it was listing 0 for a long time – and for Pathfinder Society\
  \ (second edition) tables. We fixed the Nova image display a bit ago and just uploaded\
  \ the Glyph. Those should be showing up on accounts shortly. The new rating system\
  \ is built and we’re getting trained on how to implement it so that we can get five\
  \ stars/nova (and soon glyph) status updated via the new method. We will catch up\
  \ all those who earned the status but haven’t seen their fifth star appear, so that\
  \ should be resolved shortly as well.</p>\n              <p>There is one outstanding\
  \ issue with Glyph GM credit that we need to resolve. That is Quests are currently\
  \ awarding 1 table credit. It is not our intention that a GM can run Quests as a\
  \ way to reach their 5th Glyph faster than a GM who runs scenarios. Thus, we are\
  \ changing Glyps to award award partial credit - .25 as they are one-quarter of\
  \ a scenario. At the same time, we are looking at modules and adventure paths and\
  \ what an appropriate GM credit would be for the longer form adventures. We anticipate\
  \ this will lead to several bands of GM credit based on the size/length of the adventure.\
  \ These changes are ongoing and should be resolved shortly.</p>\n              <p>Whew\
  \ – that was a bit of information. But there’s still more topics to cover.</p>\n\
  \              <h2>Origins/ConCurrent</h2>\n              <p>PaizoCon Online resulted\
  \ in running over 1200 games – many more than we would run at a traditional PaizoCon.\
  \ Knowing the demand for online games, we submitted 450ish to Origins Online. Unfortunately,\
  \ they were only able to accept 100 of our tables. This accounts for 10% of all\
  \ Origins programming, which is a large portion. But what to do with the other 350ish\
  \ tables? Seeing the demand for PaizoCon, we didn’t want to cancel the tables. Instead\
  \ of cancelling, we decided to run ConCurrent. It will function as a Premier Plus\
  \ Con with all the associated benefits. The only difference is that we are providing\
  \ HQ and admin support via our online discord server, same as we did for PaizoCon.</p>\n\
  \              <p>While we aren’t going to reopen GM signups or add more RPG games,\
  \ we do have a few vacancies for GMs as well as space in our on-call pool, which\
  \ will allow us to cover GM illness or those that don’t show for their tables without\
  \ stress. If you are interested in assisting, please join the <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/yxgMsRG\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">OPF Major Conventions discord</a>, join the Origins Online channel\
  \ and post in the #gm-waitlist thread.</p>\n              <p>A bit of oversight\
  \ on our part led to us not listing PACS games/taking PACS organizer registrations\
  \ at the same time we did the RPG GM registrations. We added the PACS tables to\
  \ our schedule and are asking anyone interested in running PACS at Origins Online/ConCurrant\
  \ to join the <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/yxgMsRG\" target=\"_blank\">OPF\
  \ Major Conventions discord</a> and visit the #gm-selection tab to register to be\
  \ table organizer for games.</p>\n              <h2>Gen Con</h2>\n             \
  \ <p>Gen Con released information about getting our events on their schedule, so\
  \ we are moving forward with requesting OPF for GMs for Gen Con. Once again, we\
  \ will do registration through the <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/yxgMsRG\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">OPF Major Conventions discord</a> starting Saturday, June 6th\
  \ at 1 PM. We post the schedule on the server and GMs may claim games on a first\
  \ come, first served registration. The current plan is to offer tables of all our\
  \ programs – Pathfinder Society (both editions), Starfinder Society, and Pathfinder\
  \ Adventure Card Society. Once we have our schedule, we will upload it to Gen Con\
  \ systems so that they can put tickets on sale. For players interested in attending\
  \ Gen Con, register to attend and view events on the <a href=\"https://www.gencon.com/\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Gen Con website</a>.</p>\n              <h2>Campaign Coins</h2>\n\
  \              <p>We awarded a number of coins at the end of PaizoCon Online. Congratulations\
