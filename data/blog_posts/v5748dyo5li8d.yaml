  ><strong>Treasure</strong> double</p> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-breaker\">Special\
  \ Abilities</p> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><strong>Create Spawn (Su)</strong>\
  \ Any humanoids slain by a wyrmwraith become <a href=\"http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/bestiary/wraith.html#dread-wraith\"\
  >dread wraiths</a> (<em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</em> 281) in 1d4 rounds. Spawn are\
  \ under the command of the wyrmwraith that created them and remain enslaved until\
  \ its death, at which point they become free-willed dread wraiths. They don’t possess\
  \ any of the abilities they had in life.</p> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><strong>Divine\
  \ Dispelling (Su)</strong> When a wyrmwraith strikes a creature with one of its\
  \ claws, that creature is also affected by a targeted <a href=\"http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/spells/dispelMagic.html#dispel-magic-greater\"\
  ><em>greater dispel magic</em></a> (CL ??th) that can dispel only divine spells.</p>\
  \ \n      <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><strong>Ectoplasmic Shift (Su)</strong> A wyrmwraith\
  \ can push through the ectoplasmic veil to temporarily assume a physical form made\
  \ of ectoplasm. As a swift action, the wyrmwraith can become corporeal for ?d? rounds.\
  \ It can return to its incorporeal form as a free action. Once its ectoplasmic form’\
  s duration ends, the wyrmwraith can’t assume that form again for ?d? rounds. While\
  \ in ectoplasmic form, the wyrmwraith loses the incorporeal ability (including its\
  \ deflection bonus to AC) and gains a +?? natural armor bonus to AC, DR ??/—, a\
  \ Strength score equal to its Dexterity score, and the phase lurch ability. The\
  \ AC for a typical wyrmwraith in ectoplasmic form is ??. When in ectoplasmic form,\
  \ its attacks are <strong>Melee</strong> bite +?? (?d?+?? plus energy drain), 2\
  \ claws +?? (?d?+?? plus divine dispelling), 2 wings +?? (?d?+?), tail slap +??\
  \ (?d?+??).</p> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><strong>Phase Lurch (Su)</strong>\
  \ A wyrmwraith in ectoplasmic form can pass through walls or material obstacles.\
  \ It must begin and end its turn outside whatever wall or obstacle it’s moving through.\
  \ It can’t move through corporeal creatures with this ability, and its movement\
  \ speed is halved while moving through a wall or obstacle. Any surface it moves\
  \ through is coated with a thin, silvery mucus that lingers for 1 minute.</p> \n\
  \      <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><strong>Positive Energy Transference (Su)</strong>\
  \ Whenever a wyrmwraith succeeds at a saving throw to resist positive energy damage\
  \ but still suffers damage, the wyrmwraith can immediately transfer that damage\
  \ to any dread wraith spawn of its choice with ?? feet that it controls. The wyrmwraith\
  \ takes any excess damage beyond the spawn’s hit points. Even if the wyrmwraith\
  \ has no spawn under its control, when it succeeds at its save against a positive\
  \ energy effect that normally deals half damage on a successful save, it instead\
  \ takes one quarter damage.</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>The Wyrmwraith tore\
  \ through the Deep Merfolk like me at a sushi bar, crushing it by a 2-to-1 margin\
  \ to win. With a veritable host of abilities at its disposal, not to mention the\
  \ ability to phase through solid objects, the Wyrmwraith is a mighty opponent, and\
  \ not one to trifle with.</p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-title\"\

  stat-block-1\"><strong>Easy to Call (Ex)</strong> Sahkils count as having 4 fewer\
  \ Hit Dice (minimum 2) for purposes of spells or effects that call outsiders, such\
  \ as planar binding. However, they receive a racial bonus equal to 1/2 their Hit\
  \ Dice on Charisma checks to break free of <em>planar binding</em> spells and similar\
  \ effects, and their spell resistance counts as if it were 5 higher for the purpose\
  \ of breaking free of <em>planar binding</em> spells and similar effects.</p> \n\
  \      <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><strong>Emotional Focus (Ex)</strong> Whenever\
  \ a sahkil casts a spell or uses a spell-like ability or effect with the emotion<sup>UM</sup>\
  \ or fear descriptors that allows a saving throw, the DC is increased by 2.</p>\
  \ \n      <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><strong>Entangling Train (Su)</strong> Creatures\
  \ adjacent to a pakalchi must succeed at a DC ?? Reflex save or become entangled\
  \ in its vines for ? rounds, and count as tethered. Entangled creatures take vine\
  \ damage automatically each round they’re entangled. Creatures are no longer entangled\
  \ if the pakalchi moves away. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p> \n      <p\
  \ class=\"stat-block-1\"><strong>Look of Fear (Su)</strong> A creature affected\
  \ by a pakalchi’s gaze is panicked for ? rounds and shaken for ?d? rounds thereafter.\
  \ A creature that successfully saves against this effect is only shaken for ? rounds.\
  \ The save DC is Charisma-based.</p> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><strong>Poison\
  \ (Ex)</strong> Thorns—injury; <em>save</em> Fort DC ??; <em>frequency</em> ?/round\
  \ for ? rounds; <em>effect</em> ?d? Wis damage; <em>cure</em> 3 consecutive saves.\
  \ A creature with Wisdom damage from a pakalchi’s poison hears paranoid whispers\
  \ warning of betrayal. It can’t treat any other creature as an ally or be a willing\
  \ target for a spell or effect. This is an emotion<sup>UM</sup> effect.</p> \n \
  \     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><strong>Skip Between (Su)</strong> Many sahkils\
  \ can shift between the Ethereal Plane and the Material Plane as a move action.\
  \ This ability is otherwise identical to <em>ethereal jaunt</em> (CL ??th).</p>\
  \ \n      <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><strong>Spirit Touch (Ex)</strong> A sahkil’\
  s natural weapons, as well as any weapon it wields, are treated as though they had\
  \ the <em>ghost touch</em> weapon special ability.</p> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-1\"\
  ><strong>Sudden Strike (Ex)</strong> Once per round, a pakalchi can extend the reach\
  \ of one claw or thorned vine by ? feet as part of a single attack. It can use this\
  \ ability to threaten additional squares to cause an enemy to provoke an attack\
  \ of opportunity.</p> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><strong>Thorns (Ex)</strong>\
  \ A pakalchi can fling a volley of poisonous thorns as a standard action (make an\
  \ attack roll for each thorn). This attack has a range of ??? feet with no range\
  \ increment.</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>The power of cute was not strong\
  \ enough to save the Lotus Leshy, and the Pakalchi Sahkil crushed it with the power\
  \ of its floral arrangement. Against the Wyrmwraith, the Pakalchi's spirit touch\
  \ will be a great aid against the incorporeal Wyrmwraith—but will it be enough?</p>\
  \ \n     <p><strong>Customer Service Representative Diego Valdez</strong>: \"No\
  \ contest, the Wyrmwraith wins. The Pakalchi may not be afraid of the undead, incorporeal,\
  \ dragon because it is immune to fear, but it should be. <em>It should be</em>.\
  \ A bit of damage resistance barely slows down a dragons jaws.\"</p> \n     <p><strong>Designer\
  \ Mark Seifter</strong>: \"The pakalchi might have barely knocked off the lotus\
  \ leshy, but she’s bitten off more than she can chew with the wyrmwraith. As she\
  \ unloads her attacks against her foe, she finds that it’s basically immune to her\
  \ entire repertoire, from fear, to mind control, to poison. Bet she wishes she hadn’\
  t given up on that whole psychopomp thing now; she might once have been a morrigna,\
  \ and then she would have stood a better chance against undead. The best thing she\
  \ can do here is step between to run away and forfeit the match. Meanwhile, the\
  \ wyrmwraith’s first breath attack has left her enervated and badly hurt. There’\
  s no chance she’ll survive the wyrmwraith's full attack!\"</p> \n     <p>Now that\
