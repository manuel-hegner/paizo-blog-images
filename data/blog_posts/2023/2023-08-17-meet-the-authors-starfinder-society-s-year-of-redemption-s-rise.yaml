              <p>Greetings, players! In today’s blog we’d like to take a moment to recognize our talented freelance authors who contributed to the most recent slate of Starfinder Society adventures. Some of these authors have been writing for us for years, while others saw their names in print for the very first time!</p>
              <p>Tune in next week for the Pathfinder Society edition of this blog, and drop your praise for our authors in the comments below!</p>
              <p><strong>Alex Speidel</strong><br><em><strong>Organized Play Coordinator</strong></em></p>
              <p><br></p>
              <p><br></p>
              <h3>Alex Speidel (he/him)<br><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02c6r?Starfinder-Society-Intro-Year-of-Redemptions-Rise"><em>Starfinder Society Intro: Year of Redemption’s Rise</em></a></h3>
              <p>Hi again, long time no see! I had the distinct honor of writing the Intro to the Year of Redemption’s Rise. As a first Starfinder scenario (indeed, a first, full-length adventure), this was a daunting task, but I’ve never been one to shy away from a challenge.</p>
              <p>My goal was not only to introduce the three new factions in fun and unique ways, but to give a “day in the life” of a Starfinder at the Lorespire Complex. I’m very pleased with how it turned out! I took inspiration from my time as a camp counselor and tour guide to write Charla’s tour, which was great fun (and apparently accidentally established an author trademark? Stay tuned for&nbsp;<a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02eji?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-606-Tomorrows-Seekers"><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #6-06: Tomorrow’s Seekers</em></a>&nbsp;to learn what that means). My favorite thing to do when I run this scenario is to pepper in some of my favorite NPCs; players will often encounter Olive and Violet leading Fitch’s children on a heist through the kitchen or see Barsala working away in the research labs. I also got to give Ehu what I referred to as his “Kennedy moment” in the conclusion (we must repair the Society in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy but because they are hard…).</p>
              <p>You can follow me on Bluesky (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/alexspeidel.bsky.social">@alexspeidel.bsky.social</a>) or Mastodon (alexspeidel@dice.camp), and as mentioned above, my next scenario is another tentpole:&nbsp;<em>Starfinder Society Scenario #6-06: Tomorrow’s Seekers</em>, wherein you’ll meet the new First Seeker candidates. I hope you all enjoy it!</p>

              <p>Hi there friends, I’m Alison Cybe. Pronouns are they/them or she/her. I’m the author of the Starfinder Scenario&nbsp;<em>Fugue of the Traitor</em>.</p>
              <p>In it, I wanted to mix a classic Agatha Christie style murder-mystery with an exploration into grassroots liberation movements; why groups of people rise to fight for themselves against oppressive cultures. Not a common mix of themes, but I’m a firm believer that the games we play can be about subjects and that entertainment media should always have something to say.</p>
              <p>I penned the adventure over a year ago now, and I’ve had time to look back on what sections I enjoy the most and what I would change. I think the mystery section is the element that comes across the best, allows the players to get stuck in; but I would have loved it more if I’d have had more time to frame the NPCs and let the characters know them. I sometimes worry that I went overboard on the descriptions of imperialist atrocities, as that is what content warnings are for.</p>
              <p>This year is my foray into creating adventures for Pathfinder Society, and you can find my adventure,&nbsp;<a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02ejh?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-502-The-Blackwood-Lost"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #5-02:&nbsp;The Blackwood Lost</em></a>, on sale this month. Inspirations for it include the covers of many prog rock albums. How is that an inspiration? Play it and see! I was also allowed to work in a subplot that’s very important to me...</p>

              <p>Hey everyone, my name is Isis Wozniakowska (she/her), and I wrote&nbsp;<em>Starfinder Society Scenario&nbsp;#5-04: Fragment of the 4</em><em><sup>th</sup></em>, one of season 5’s the Drift Crisis themed scenarios for levels 9-12. It was my first major foray into writing something that high of level, though I’ve played through several Starfinder Adventure Paths and tons of scenarios of those levels and love seeing what the game can do up there and what kinds of crazy abilities players can have. My main priority was making sure the scenario really felt like a continuation of so many things the Starfinders have done across the past seasons and make sure that even in times like the Drift Crisis, they have made a good impact on the universe and can keep doing so if they stick to it. I won’t spoil anything that happens, but I’m super proud of the NPCs in it and how they remind us that Starfinder Society Organized Play is a living campaign with continuity. Aside from that I’m also just happy because it’s high level content and truly we all get that great endorphin rush when the numbers go up. Big number go BrrrRRRrrrr!</p>

              <p>Hello! I'm Hilary Moon Murphy (aka Hmm) a Minneapolis librarian and writer. I am here today to talk about my favorite&nbsp;<em>Starfinder Society Scenario #5-06: Tarnished Legacy: Historia's Holdout</em>. I loved writing this scenario because it is part mystery, part wacky dungeon delve, and all heart. If you haven't played it yet, I hope that it surprises you in the best possible way.</p>
              <p>One of the challenges that I faced with this scenario is that Historia Prime was a past villain who had so much awful history. Was there anything new that I could reveal about his nefarious deeds, and still keep a light-hearted tone to this adventure? It was an interesting balancing act.</p>
              <p>(Historia's Holdout is followed by the delightful&nbsp;<a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02dvn?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-508-Tarnished-Legacy-Star-Sugar-Superstar"><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #5-08 Tarnished Legacy: Star Sugar Superstar!!!</em></a>&nbsp;written by the very talented Emily Parks, but each part of this two-part mini-arc is a complete story in itself.)</p>
              <p>If you are looking for more of my work, I am very excited for the upcoming&nbsp;<a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02emu?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-503-Heidmarch-Heist"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #5-03: Heidmarch Heist</em></a>, a mystery that will offer the famous Sheila and Canayven Heidmarch their first appearances in a PF2 Scenario.</p>

              <p>Howdy!<br>
                My name is Letterio Mammoliti (he/him) and I wrote&nbsp;<em>Starfinder Society Scenario #5-09: Counterfeit History</em>&nbsp;for the Year of Redemption’s Rise. I had incredible fun working on this adventure even though it meant showcasing some Starfinders in a less than positive light. I got to include an arrogant espraksa, create a gang of thugs, and two dedicated archaeologists, which is always great!</p>
              <p>It is hard to say which part was my favorite. I loved making the day of Dig Boss Hartek a truly miserable one (even before the Starfinders showed up) and I enjoyed describing the Vartaikam Bazaar and the Firewings’ operation.</p>
              <p>My twitter is&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/Letterio_DM">@Letterio_DM</a>, although I am rarely active there. I have also worked on&nbsp;<a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02e18?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-406-Signal-from-the-Electric-Laboratory"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #4-06: Signal from the Electric Laboratory</em></a>.</p>
              <p>I am glad I was given the chance to work on a Starfinder adventure, especially considering the incredible work that everyone has been doing on this amazing game.</p>
              <p><br></p>

              <p>You Starfinders wish to know the secrets of the Vault Lord? You are braver or more foolish than most! We shall indulge your curiosity before you are scattered to dust.</p>
              <p>The tales of Salvation’s End are not dissimilar from the speculative works of your primitive entertainments, with the cursed Guiding Intelligence treating test subjects like characters from your Outer Limits or Twilight Zone. But we have transcended such simple games and prefer the more exciting adventures like your Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon, watching the futile efforts of these heroes as they clash against ultimate powers like ourselves. We have always stopped watching once they find themselves in a certainly lethal trap, assured of their ultimate demise.</p>
              <p>Our most recent target vault for conquest is an advanced center of work, entertainment and learning, an Experiential Proper Center Of Testing. With the inhabitants there under our power, the domination of this station will soon be at hand! Then we shall delight in your fellow Starfinders’ pleas for mercy before delivering the final crushing blow.</p>

              <p>...They escaped?! Impossible! Next time, Starfinders! Next time!</p>

I really enjoyed working on this scenario, particularly working with Kate to make sure that all the clues were consistent with the true nature of the situation the PCs find themselves in, while avoiding being so obvious they give away the secret. I'm really proud of where this one ended up, and I hope you enjoy! You can find me on Twitter&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/dkmuldoon">@dkmuldoon</a>&nbsp;(at least until Triune finally decides it's a bad idea and shuts it down). For more of my recent Starfinder work, check out my article on Gaskari in&nbsp;<a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02egv?Starfinder-Ports-of-Call"><em>Starfinder</em></a><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02egv?Starfinder-Ports-of-Call"><em>Ports of Call</em></a>, and my volume in the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Mechaggedon!</em>&nbsp;adventure path, due some time in 2024!</p>

              <p>My first credit freelancing with Paizo was&nbsp;<a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01zn7?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-203-The-Withering-World"><em>Starfinder Society #2-03: The Withering World</em></a>. Getting to write for Starfinder Society is always a treat. Since the games are single sessions, it forces me to have a focus on each part working just right. However, they're also part of a larger world, so I can dig into aspects of the setting that I want to explore. For&nbsp;<em>Starfinder Society #5-15: Beta Test</em>, I got to do both of these. While it's designed as a Starfinder Society adventure, it's great for anyone looking for a single session in the level 11-14 range.</p>
              <p>I'm also excited to have my authorship on a volume of&nbsp;<em>Mechageddon!</em>&nbsp;announced. If you like my design style at all, you should play or run&nbsp;<em>Mechageddon!</em>&nbsp;when it comes out (or before, if you're a precog). It's got everything a person could want, like mechs, kaiju, and - oh no, I'm being pushed off stage so I don't spoil the ending! Well, I guess you'll have to play it to find out.</p>

              <p>Hi! I'm Chris Wasko (he/him), and I've written a few Paizo adventures, most recently&nbsp;<em>Starfinder Society Scenario #5-16: To Catch a King</em>. The outline for this scenario was one of the most detailed I've received, with multiple set pieces, plot developments, and requests for fully-fleshed NPCs with distinct personalities and motivations. I leaned on some ideas from my very first scenario—<a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9huz?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-7-18-Faithless-and-Forgotten-Part-3-The-Infernal-Inheritance"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #7-18: Faithless and Forgotten, Part 3: The Infernal Inheritance</em></a>—to realize the scenario's central setting, creating a dynamic playground for PCs to explore. I particularly enjoyed writing the more antagonistic "Starfinders," figuring out their tics and how PCs could understand and manipulate them without open conflict. I'm excited for some more of my work to emerge in the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Mechageddon!</em>&nbsp;adventure, as well as to see some of my favorite scenarios being revamped in the Scoured Stars adventure path!</p>
