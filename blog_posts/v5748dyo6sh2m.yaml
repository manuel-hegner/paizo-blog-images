  >Amiri</a> as a character. I was drawn in first by her artwork, then by her story.\
  \ It’s sometimes hard to justify why your barbarian is so damn angry all the time;\
  \ Amiri’s tribe and brother tried to have her killed because of rampant misogyny.\
  \ Yeah, my only question is if she ever <i>stops</i> raging. </p> \n     <div class=\"\

  \ \n      <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\">First rule of Badass Club: Amiri wins. No\
  \ more rules. </p> \n     </div> \n     <p>Amiri was in my party when I first played\
  \ through Rise of the Runelords, along with Seoni and Lini. I played Lini, but I\
  \ really appreciated Amiri’s toughness, always being ready for combat, and her ability\
  \ to charge around everywhere. Especially when Amiri would take Lini along for the\
  \ ride. I assumed Lini would perch on her shoulders to leave Amiri’s hands free\
  \ for slaughtering. I imagine the player of Amiri assumed he was tossing a gnome\
  \ in a backpack, or possibly just winding up and hurling her like a discus. </p>\
  \ \n     <p>A lot of players balk at the bury cost for barbarian rage, but I usually\
  \ consider it a feature. Especially with a small hand size, it’s nice to thin your\
  \ deck to just the cards you care the most about. Amiri is also a fantastic character\
  \ for everyone in the party to throw their unneeded boons to. All the easier since\
  \ she can do whatever she wants on her turn, then move at the end of her turn to\
  \ your location.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/011020_BarbarianClassDeckAmiri1.jpg\"\

  \ \n     </div> \n     <p>The Barbarian Class Deck was the first class deck that\
  \ I got to work on from start to finish, so it has a special place in my heart.\
  \ Class Deck Amiri takes the Runelords formula and, well, kinda just does everything\
  \ better. She gives up a little bit of Survival to pick up Fortitude, which is thematically\
  \ excellent and occasionally gives you more armor to feed to your rage. She’s better\
  \ at barrier-busting and moving when her location closes (if you’re using Core Set\
  \ rules, <a href=\"https://\" paizo.com paizo faq v5748nrupch3i#v5748eaidgstr>this\
  \ Conversion Guide entry</a> will come in handy on that front.) Perhaps most importantly,\
  \ she has the best paired roles in the entire game: <i>Unstoppable Force and Immovable\
  \ Object</i>.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/011020_CoreCharacterAmiri1.jpg\"\

  \ \n      <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Still unstoppable, but even shinier.</p>\
  \ \n     </div> \n     <p><i>Core Set</i> Amiri has a fairly recognizable first\
  \ and last power, though with a couple key tweaks. First, her “rage” power has seen\
  \ some dramatic improvements: It can scale with skill feats, giving her more reason\
  \ to take Constitution. It has an option to bury from your discards, which should\
  \ open the power up to even some of the most bury-averse players. And it works on\
  \ any check against a monster. Amiri can’t dodge dragon breath, but she can scream\
  \ and charge right through it. That’s more like it.</p> \n     <p>Her movement power\
  \ is a lot like the Runelords version, except <i>Core</i> really emphasizes helping\
  \ out characters at your location, so Amiri gets to take them along for free now.\
  \ Her middle power to keep exploring after closing her location is entirely due\
  \ to a <i>Core</i> rules change, leaving her in the special spot of being able to\
  \ close multiple locations without nearly as many shenanigans as other characters.\
  \ </p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/011020_CurseWeaponShockGlaive.jpg\"\

  \ \n      <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Amiri gets a lot of weapons and knows how\
  \ to use them.</p> \n     </div> \n     <p><i>Core</i> Amiri also picked up a very\
  \ nice change to her favored card, requiring it be Melee. Among other things, that\
  \ means Amiri can include that bow in her art without potentially ruining her starting\
  \ hand. She can use the bow much like a blessing for a friend’s combat, then bury\
  \ it from her discards for her own combat.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ \n      <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Amiri likes lots of boons. You might want\
  \ to give them to her before she has to take them.</p> \n     </div> \n     <p><i>Core</i>\
  \ really treats Amiri well for armor, with Hide Armors leveraging her skills and\
  \ displayable armor getting out of her fairly small hand. Generally speaking, there\
  \ are a lot of good things for Amiri at level 4 in <i>Curse</i>, too. Turns out\
  \ that if you spend an entire level trying to impress Shoanti barbarians, it’s not\
  \ only good to be a barbarian for generating Respect points, but the rewards also\
  \ use your talents.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/011020_CoreSetRoleResistanceFighter.jpg\"\

  max-width:50%\" src=\"/image/content/Blog/011020_CoreSetRoleSmashmouth.jpg\"></a>\
  \ \n      <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Smashmouth is the role name I most expected\
  \ to be vetoed. [Vic notes: I let it pass because, hey now, she’s a rock star.</p>\
  \ \n     </div> \n     <p>Resistance Fighter has an eclectic selection of power\
  \ feats that do neat things like letting people bless her combat checks freely,\
  \ letting her examine a card at her new location after she moves at the end of her\
  \ turn, and protecting her hand (though not her deck) from damage. I suspect the\
  \ feat that draws players the most, though, is the scourge removal when raging.\
  \ Scourges are sometimes infuriating, so a trivial way to get out of them is invaluable.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>By comparison, Smashmouth’s main draw is probably raging against barriers,\
  \ often the bane of any intrepid barbarian. And encouraging your allies to recharge\
  \ their blessings to bless you. It also picks up some extremely useful benefits\
  \ to more weapon card feats by letting you add to local combat checks and reduce\
  \ damage suffered to 0 with your weapons. When every problem looks like you can\
  \ smash it, bring the right smasher.</p> \n     <p>That’s our new Amiri. She’s the\
  \ fourth (and last) of the Core Set Quick-Start characters, so our <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgw0?Core-Design-Sajan\"\
  >series on the Core iconics</a> could go anywhere after this! Feel free to suggest\
  \ what Core Set character you’d like us to discuss next below, though I make no\
  \ guarantees where the muse will take us. </p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p style=\"\
