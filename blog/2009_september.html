              <p><b>Skyreach</b>: This five-towered fortress, visible from miles away over Abaslom's skyline, is the heart of the Pathfinder Society. Here the Decemvirate rules and make its rare pronouncements beneath the enchanted skylights of the Great Hall in the central tower, and both resident and visiting Pathfinders sequester themselves in cozy lounges to study, socialize, and plot future missions. Packed tight with chambers ranging from well-known ballrooms named after nations to innumerable trophy rooms and museums to rows of featureless doors identified only by number, Skyreach is a warren that only the Decemvirate understands completely. The majority of its mysterious spaces are off-limits to all but those specifically invited by Ambrus Valsin, the venture-captain who runs the daily operations of the Grand Lodge at the Decemvirate's command.</p> 
              <p>Meticulous with details and annoyed by inefficiency, Ambrus makes a point to supervise all important duties within the Grand Lodge, and keeps a long list of relatively safe but time-consuming jobs on file, ready to hand out to rookie Pathfinders to keep them busy and out of the way of more experienced agents. Tall and meticulously groomed, Ambrus doesn't appreciate backtalk and reserves particularly strenuous assignments for those who annoy him.</p>

              <p>Cave Raptors are sated; It's time to blog!</p> 
              <p>When last we left <a href="/pathfinder/pathfinderCompanion/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy87dj" target="nofollow"><i>Dwarves of Golarion</i></a>, it was a mere egg of an outline, being fussed over by attentive parents and waiting to hatch. But now it is time for that blessed moment when an idea emerges into the world as written words! It is time for… the development phase!</p> 
              <p>Development is the process of growing a book from an idea and a few rough notes into written text, rearing the infant outline into a rebellious and hateful teenager who will keep you up at nights, drinking your secret stash of scotch and praying to god it turns out alright. Much like the rearing of the noble octopus, a game product requires two separate parties: the designer and the developer. Designers are the writers and artists (more on those wily and attractive artists next week), while the developers are the core who tie everything together. Where developers are comparable to an overprotective parent, designers are more akin to teachers: chosen carefully by the developer to impart information and direction to their snot-nosed offspring.</p> 
              <p>Of course, this is not an insult. Both octopi and game developers are widely known for their post-nasal drip.</p> 
              <p>Choosing a writer is a careful task. Like parents, developers want someone who will make their job easier. These choices are made by means of an arcane formula that takes into account past products, punctuality, and relative position of the stars. Managing Editor Wes Schneider admits that Paizo relies on a small, incestuous lot of authors to rear our products. Putting new designers through their paces requires time and branding irons, both of which Paizo has in painfully limited quantities*.</p> 
              <p>For roleplaying products, the ideal designer can fill three vital roles for the juvenile product: author, game mechanic, and artisan. Telling a good story and having a firm grasp of the mechanics are important, but just as vital and oft overlooked is the role of player-friendly artifacts in a young game's life. Like a sweater vest, legible maps and gripping player handouts are those little touches that decide if a product rides along on the bus or resides at the cool table at lunch. </p> 
              <p>The developers' job is just as challenging and vital to give their books the best chance at happiness. They need to organize everything those precious bundles have absorbed from their designers and make sure they play nice with the other products. A developer needs to tweak the mechanics to balance with the system at large, rewrite some fluff to keep the narrative canon, and embarrass the product in front of its friends. Even the best writing needs at least a week or two in development, says Schneider, because "folks aren't here every day, and they don't know exactly what we need."</p> 
              <p><i>Dwarves of Golarion</i> and similar anthology products are like troubled foster kids: they get bounced between several authors and other corrupting influences. A firm and loving eyeball is needed to guide them through this troubled time. The twitterpated Sean Reynolds, developer in charge of this problem child, has had his hands full. Every line written by its savage gang of authors needs to be reviewed for balance and continuity, and he must occasionally search its room for illicit substances and pop culture references.</p> 
              <p>Without proper development, a game product suffers. Its already-overworked Paizo parents stretch themselves too thin trying to write thousands of words a day while maintaining their backbreaking day jobs in the grammar mines. Neglected and uneducated, the books would fall back into dull narrative habits and eventually turn to crime to make ends meet. Crime rates skyrocket, property values plummet, and we are all left unprepared for the forthcoming invasion of the reptimen from the Earth's core!</p> 
              <p>So, for a happy and contributing addition to the RPG landscape, make sure you follow the example of the methodical octopus. Keep a close group of talent to help raise your products, but don't give away your own parental responsibilities!</p> 
              <p>Tune in next week, when we examine the art of art, and stretch the octopus metaphor to it's breaking point!</p>

              <p class="tiny">*Wes also mentions that if you're a newcomer who'd like to write for Paizo and has a high pain threshold, you should still write and submit. Both the Pathfinder Society Open Call and RPG Superstar are Paizo's favorite tools for reviewing new blood in an organized setting. Publishing your own material online through a blog or website is a good icebreaker as well (check out <a href="http://paizo.com/paizo/about/communityuse">Paizo's Community Use Policy</a> for more details). Being on productive and nonviolent terms with other publishers also helps, as the RPG industry is made up of a mere 73 people, all of whom know each other personally and frequently gather for the imbibing of caustic organic solvents.</p>

              <p>More than two years ago it fell to me to write the <a target="nofollow" href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/35E/riseOfTheRunelords/v5748btpy7xpx"><i>Rise of the Runelords Player's Guide</i></a>, setting the stage for characters to take part in a world that was, at the time, painted not even in broad strokes but more in generally tossed bucket-sized splashes. Over time and through hundreds of thousands of words, though, what started as made-up names have transformed into some of the better-known characters, organizations, and locations in Golarion. But probably the passage that folks have grabbed onto most zealously comes from the description of the paladin on page 8, "Korvosa—in its traditional ties to Cheliax—enthusiastically supplies Citadel Vraid, bastion of the Hellknight Order of the Nail. The Chelish Hellknights pay homage to no deity, but rather bend the rigid law and infernal traditions of Hell to their will."</p> 
              <p>For years now folks have asked for more details on this iron-shod order of enforcers, even beyond their details in the <a target="nofollow" href="/store/downloads/pathfinder/pathfinderChronicles/35E/v5748btpy84eo"><i>Pathfinder Chronicles Campaign Setting</i></a>, but the time has never seemed quite right to give away the entire farm—I admit, I've been kind of precious with my pet antiheroes. At the same time, rules for running or playing Hellknights have always been vague, largely because I didn't want to work up a class that would immediately have to be updated to the <a target="nofollow" href="/store/downloads/pathfinder/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj">Pathfinder Roleplaying Game</a>. But now, with the PF RPG rules in circulation, my blasphemous baby <a target="nofollow" href="/pathfinder/pathfinderChronicles/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy85jm"><i>Book of the Damned Volume 1: Princes of Darkness</i></a> nearing the shelves, and the <a target="nofollow" href="/store/games/roleplayingGames/p/pathfinderRPG/paizo/pathfinderAdventurePaths/councilOfThieves/v5748btpy87da">Council of Thieves Adventure Path</a> being set in the very city where the Hellknights were formed, the time finally feels right. </p>
              <p>So, as of <a target="nofollow" href="/store/games/roleplayingGames/p/pathfinderRPG/paizo/pathfinderAdventurePaths/councilOfThieves/v5748btpy87db"><i>Pathfinder Adventure Path</i> volume #27</a>, the Hellknights finally march forth, that volume revealing everything characters need to confront, research, and even join the numerous orders of Hellknights. That's right, that does mean there's finally going to be a Hellknight prestige class—and one of the largest ones I've ever seen at that.</p> 
              <p>But that's not all: in <a target="nofollow" href="/store/games/roleplayingGames/p/pathfinderRPG/paizo/pathfinderAdventurePaths/councilOfThieves/v5748btpy87dc"><i>Pathfinder Adventure Path</i> volume #28</a>, expect the other side of the coin, with a GM-focused inside look into the mindset, citadels, and history of these infamous orders.</p> 
              <p>So that's back-to-back months of Hellknight action coming at you, finally answering many questions about the deadly knighthood, yet also revealing dozens of new mysteries. For example, taken from <a target="nofollow" href="/store/games/roleplayingGames/p/pathfinderRPG/paizo/pathfinderAdventurePaths/councilOfThieves/v5748btpy87db"><i>Pathfinder</i> #27</a>, presented here are just two of the several new lesser Hellknight Orders detailed therein. But that will have to do for now—not surprisingly, the Hellknights frown upon spoilers.</p> 
              <br> <b>Lesser Orders</b>
              <br> 
              <p>Despite the cull of 4639, numerous lesser orders of Hellknights still exist. Most of these orders work at the edges of Cheliax's sphere of influence or within the countries once within the Chelish empire's thrall. Despite their smaller size, the majority of these factions uphold the same code as their elder, better-established brethren, though many uphold practices that subtly deviate from the core knighthood. Most are careful not to defy the mandates of the Measure and the Chain (the core philosophies of the Hellknights; detailed in <i>Pathfinder Adventure Path</i> volume #28), however, as the larger, more powerful orders are mindful of those who would use the Hellknight name to opposing ends.</p> 
              <p><b>Order of the Crux</b>: One of several bands of mercenaries dubbed Hellknights during the Chelish civil war, the skull-clad Order of the Crux refused to disband after the revolution. Hunted down and destroyed by the Order of the Scourge in 4663, the butchers were slaughtered and their fortress, Citadel Gheisteno, put to the torch. However, 25 years later, three graveknights clad in scarred Hellknight armor rose from the ruin. Calling themselves the Order of the Crux and led by the venomous Lictor Shokneir, the undead triune lurks upon the border of Nidal and Molthune, seemingly biding their time.</p> 
              <p><b>Order of the Coil</b>: Among the smallest Hellknight factions, the Order of the Coil maintains holdings near the Sargavan city of Eleder, from where they viciously seek to tame the tribal natives of the country and put an end to their backward pollution of the outside world. Seeing the efforts of scholars and adventurers—particularly Pathfinders—as spreading a disease of savagery by carrying curios from the jungles into the world beyond, the Coil hunts down and destroys such explorers and artifacts, notorious for ending these perceived corruptions with poison and flames. The favored weapon of the Order of the Coil is the greataxe.</p>

              <p>Cave raptors are sated, so now it is time for blogging!</p> 
              <p>Few things spring into the world fully formed, and game products are no exception. And if you aren't involved in the publishing industry, you might expect the life cycle of a supplement as unknowable as that of an octopus.</p> 
              <p>And it is.</p> 
              <p>As a neophyte nanny in the Paizo maternity ward, my elbows-deep, on-the-job training has been a real eye-opener. And if I have to suffer through that experience, then there's no reason not to share the pain. Over the next few weeks, we'll take a look at the stages of development of a young sourcebook, show off embarrassing baby pictures, and generally demystify the miracle of life as we follow <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinder/pathfinderCompanion/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy87dj&quot;" target="nofollow"><i>Dwarves of Golarion</i></a> from Outline, to Development, through Art Orders, Editing, Layout, Extra Editing, and finally Printing and Shipping.</p> 
              <p>The octopus knows it is time to reproduce when the seasons are right. Similarly, Paizo Publisher par excellence, Erik Mona, explains that a product first emerges when the various carriers demand a season's previews for their catalogs. At this point, the development team enters a furious ritual to determine whose memes are passed on to the next generation of Pathfinder canon.</p> 
              <p>Once the product ideas are agreed upon, each one goes on to outlining.</p> 
              <p>As a book egg, the outline doesn't tell us much, except that the book is healthy and to start preparing the office for its blessed arrival. We know who the proud papas are, and the outline hints if the book will grow into a fluffy nerd or crunchy jock, but nothing is set in stone just yet. Developers dig out warm nests in a hard drive to house the outline, lining it with file folders and sticky notes until writers can be assigned to help the book hatch and develop. A title (and adorable nickname) is decided upon, the chapters are parsed out, words counts are decided, and a handful of notes give developers and contributors an idea what the baby book will look like all grown up.</p> 
              <p>Unlike the noble octopus, the developer does not hover over the outline, constantly blowing salt water over it. Sean Reynolds occasionally spills latte on his, but more in a crude ritual to beg the gaming gods for the product's continued health.</p> 
              <p>Some things are immutable: Companions and Modules are Small sized (32pages), while Chronicles and APs will grow to Medium size (64 and 96 pages). Much like octopi, the largest, healthiest writers get first claim to the larger, healthier books, though until the outline hatches into development, even it's parentage can change.</p> 
              <div>
               <table border="0" align="right">
                <tbody>
                 <tr>
                  <td><a href="/image/content/PathfinderCompanion/PZO9408-SampleOutline.jpg" target="nofollow"><img border="0" src="/image/content/PathfinderCompanion/PZO9408-SampleOutline_180.jpeg"></a></td>

                 </tr>
                </tbody>
               </table>
              </div> 
              <p>As we can see from these adorable <i>Dwarves of Golarion</i> baby photos, the prenatal book doesn't resemble the adult product except in title. As the final draft of the outline, it's already showing the beginning signs of development: Exact words counts for each chapter have been decided and writers have been assigned to sit on the project until it hatches. We can also see in the bottom, left-hand corner that a goblin has chewed on this outline: an obvious indicator of superior product!</p> 
              <p>Without the outline, development would grow higgledy-piggledy, with chapters repeating each other, growing like tumors until they stretched the page count to breaking. Writers would run free, uncontrolled and burning things they shouldn't burn. Chaos would spill into the streets, and civilization as we know it would crumble.</p> 
              <p>So remember kids, be like the mighty octopus: plan your books carefully before getting started and save us all unneeded anarchy.</p>

              <h1><br>What Are the Six Trials?</h1> 
              <p>In modern times, The Six Trials of Larazod is best known as the fictional account of a Chelish tiefling named Larazod Rilsane. Larazod receives a vision from Asmodeus in which the dark god unveils a prominent Chelish magistrate—the sinister Paraduke Montigny Haanderthan—as a traitor to Cheliax, who has compacted with demonic powers and plans to bring the worship of Asmodeus to a sharp and brutal end. Burning with unholy justice and diabolical purpose, Larazod, along with his stalwart companions, sets out to expose the highly placed traitor Haanderthan. They are greatly overmatched, as Larazod is a minor scion of a piddling noble house whose influence lies tattered in the wake of Thrune's seizure of power in Cheliax. Undaunted, Larazod vows a smoldering blood oath to Asmodeus to see the traitor fall before Haanderthan's actions bring the dark glory of Cheliax low.</p> 
              <p>Larazod's actions swiftly bring him to the attention of the Paraduke, who has the young tiefling scooped up in the crushing grasp of the law and brought before his dark tribunal for questioning. There, a dire confrontation ensues wherein Larazod reveals his vision and heaps accusations upon Haanderthan in full view of a well-attended tribunal session. Outrage and scandal threaten to topple the order of things, and Larazod's enemies grow in number. Only one high-placed member of the tribunal takes his part—a beautiful daughter of House Sarini and rival of Haanderthan named Ilsandra. A sultry love affair between Ilsandra and Larazod develops as the pair seeks to topple the treacherous Haanderthan. </p> 
              <p>Haanderthan, using the awesome influence granted a man of his stature, forces Larazod to undergo six trials to prove the truth of his accusations, stating, "If Asmodeus truly granted you this vision, then his almighty black hand shall shield you from dismemberment and disembowelment in the trials we've planned. Surely your faith does not waver?" Larazod agrees to the trials, blasting the magistrate with unholy oaths to see his foolish plans undone. </p> 
              <p>The trials follow. Combat with foul beasts and grievous tortures leaves Larazod and his companions brutally maimed both in body and soul. At its climax, though, Larazod emerges unharmed and is vindicated as Asmodeus himself drags the nefarious magistrate to Hell. </p> 
              <p>Despite the spectacle and fame of this piece, perhaps the most interesting aspect of the play is that it is rarely performed to completion. The reality of these trials in their most lethal form—as the play's stage directions detail—prove so intense that nearly every performance ends in the gruesome onstage death of the actors playing Larazod and his companions, those who vow to join him in his darkest hour and face the trials alongside him. </p> 
              <h1><br>Historical Notes on the Piece</h1> 
              <p>The writer of The Six Trials of Larazod was a legendary playwright of House Sarini named Lokoris. Writing throughout the 4640s, Lokoris was a minor scion of his house who rose to prominence through his gifts of the quill, and who maintained a complete aloofness from political rhetoric or commentary in his many other successful black comedies and heart-breaking tragedies. A signature of his style was the combination of the comic and the serious, a hitherto unexplored mixture of human experience in Chelish drama. Lokoris was a devout follower of Asmodeus in his personal life, and yet his plays were known for their ability to present characters from all walks of life and even different faiths more vividly and realistically than his contemporaries. </p> 
              <p>The age old play known as Six Trials of Larazod was considered an outrageous piece, even more so after Lokoris’s revisions to the classic—wherein Larazod, a common man, defies the will of a corrupt magistrate. Rewriting this classic plot into both a violent celebration and sideways denouncement of the new Chelish regime, Lokoris transformed it into one of the most avant-garde and sadistic plays in the country’s history. In its time one performance caused widespread riots throughout the city of Westcrown. Lokoris was soon revealed as the playwright, not only ending his career but resulting in his disappearance. He was never found or heard from again, but common theory holds he was swept up by agents of House Thrune and his soul consigned to some bleak corner of Hell for all eternity—an ironic twist of life imitating art. </p> 
              <p>The play was banned for over 50 years then revived by a later troupe, whose playing of the piece in the outer regional theatres of Cheliax met with great success (though they went through actors quickly as the trials devoured a few each night). However, as the play began to pick up traction among larger and more respectable troupes, the play proved untenable once more. A production by a highly regarded troupe in Egorian resulted in the audience storming the stage and tearing apart the actors playing both Larazod and Haanderthan. </p> 
              <p>Since, the play is oft discussed in drama academies and among the well-read elite of Cheliax but has never received a serious staging. Until now. </p> 
              <h1><br>The Three Larazods</h1> 
              <p>There have been several restagings of Lokoris’s The Six Trials of Larazod in the last dozen years, but these have been from a much adapted and markedly less lethal text bearing more in common with the original, centuries old text. Finding a "Lokoris version” or a classic “Original Larazod” now is not easy, but texts arise from time to time. As such, audiences attending the play often don't know from which text the actors will be performing, with those expecting a night of theater instead finding themselves attending a bloodbath and visa versa.</p> 
              <p>In the modern readaption, as in the original, Tybain merely serves as comic relief (even most Lokoris versions cut many of his blasphemous musings on Aroden's power and what not). Additionally, the entire endgame of the plot is often reworked, and the character of Ilsandra much changed. In this revision, Ilsandra is a succubus who delivers a false vision onto Larazod to urge the youth to topple Montigny Haanderthan—in this version vindicated as a true patriot, falsely accused through abyssal treachery. Therein, Ilsandra is the real culprit, Larazod the flawed tragic hero, and Haanderthan a true believer in Asmodeus under false accusation. Obviously, this reading of the play is far more palatable to most nobles' sensibilities and on occasion receives patronage and stagings. The Lokoris version, while deadlier and far more of a spectacle, sees a tiefling triumphing over one of the rulers of the land and seems to encourage defiance against the aristocracy—features that, regardless of the villain's corruption, do not sit well with the noblesse. </p> 
              <h1><br>Dramatis Personae</h1> 
              <p>Being those to face damnation and torments most foul amid the Six-Fold Trial. </p>
              <p><b>LARAZOD RILSANE</b>: A tiefling at a time when being a tiefling isn't easy. To most Chelaxians, tieflings are considered a distasteful mixing of pure bloodlines and diabolic influences based not on thoughtful and potent compacts and bargains, but rather a crude relationship and mere carnal episode bearing rotten fruit. Larazod is a low-ranking scion of a lesser house and has no real influence. He achieved nominal acclaim as an officer in the Everwar but has never really been recognized as a hero. He is an odd choice for Asmodeus's messenger, but his faith in the Dark Lord is peerless and unquestioning. He is a simple and low-ranking member of society who is chosen nonetheless by Asmodeus to right a terrible wrong through faith alone.</p> 
              <p><b>DENTRIS MALAGRADA</b>: An old, cantankerous wizard and a retainer in Larazod's family for as long as anyone can remember. He has forgotten more about magic than most wizards ever knew. While his magic is rusty, his mind is otherwise sharp, and his rapier wit cuts down most foes before violence is even an option in their mind. As snarly and grumpy as he is, he loves Larazod like a son, and though he tries to talk the zealous youth out of his dire course of action several times, he still marches steadfastly into death and dismemberment with his tiefling master once his sound advice is ignored. He is the character who most often moves audiences to tears, and his death during the trials often leaves no dry eye in the house.</p> 
              <p><b>TYBAIN OBEISAN</b>: A paladin of Aroden who is drawn to close kinship with Larazod not by common religion, but rather by the mutual power of their faith in their own respective gods. The religious discourse between these two characters in the original manuscript illuminates just how close faiths can be, even when diametrically opposed. Tybain serves mostly as comic relief in this play, though theorists claim his original purpose was far more dramatically interesting, and meant to serve as insightful religious and political commentary. However, most of this was cut in staged adaptations for obvious reasons, and only the comic bits involving this character remain. The actor cast as Tybain traditionally dies first in the Trials and usually to audience applause.</p> 
              <p><b>ILSANDRA</b>: The diabolic daughter of House Sarini who falls in torrid lust/love with Larazod. Whether or not Ilsandra really loves the young soldier turned tyrant-toppler is a topic of much heated debate among noteworthy drama critics. Many insist she is just using the boy to take down her rival. Either way, no one can deny her canny, Machiavellian mind and demure use of both her charms and wiles to come out on top in the play's conclusion (whether Larazod survives or not).</p> 
              <p><b>DROVALID VORCLUNE</b>: Para Inquisitor of the Tribunal, a deeply pious giant of a man whose flesh is one long taut veneer of scar tissue. He is a self-flagellant whose zealous love of his duties as head torturer is matched only by his zealous belief in Asmodeus's will. Assigned to administer soul-rending tortures to Larazod, the giant is converted by the tiefling's unyielding devotion to his beliefs and decides to assist the unlikely prophet through the remainder of his trials.</p> 
              <p><b>MONTIGNY HAANDERTHAN</b>: The sadistic, traitorous, and demon-corrupted paraduke of Cheliax who engineers and oversees Larazod's trials. Arrogant and self-serving, he uses his lofty station in an attempt to deflect Larazod's accusations and put an end to both his accuser and his political rivals. His fate is decided, though, as soon as he defies Asmodeus's chosen servant.</p> 
              <p><b>BAILFF</b>: The left hand and herald of magistrate Haanderthan. This nameless servant of the court introduces the feared paraduke and speaks no more, though his ominous presence lingers throughout the trial.</p> 
              <p><b>THE PRINCE OF DARKNESS</b>: The archfiend and lord of Hell himself, whose hand shields Larazod throughout his trials and who ultimately exacts his own judgment upon both the accused and the accuser.</p>

              <h1><br> Pathfinder RPG Open Call for Pathfinder Society Organized Play</h1> 
              <p class="date"> Thursday, September 17, 2009</p> 
              <p>Hello and welcome to the first installment of the Pathfinder Society scenario open call using the new Pathfinder RPG rules! Most months we'll open one of our Pathfinder Society scenarios to you, the general public, to search for new authors and new ideas for use in Paizo's worldwide organized play campaign. We're looking for authors who have a clear and concise writing style, who have solid and creative ideas for adventures, and who are capable in every way of following instructions and meeting deadlines. And while we're seeking new authors through this process, we certainly encourage previously published authors to participate as well.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As always, keep the following guidelines in mind when submitting:</p> 
              <blockquote> 
               <p>1. Don't break our world. If you submit something that breaks part of our world, it'll be auto-rejected. The scenarios are 4-hour adventures—epic story arcs, world-shattering events, wars, mass famine, etc. don't have a place in them.</p> 
               <p>2. Understand Pathfinder Society Organized Play before you submit. Specifically, understand that the Pathfinder Society is an organization of vagabond scholars, thrill-seeking treasure hunters, and extreme explorers. They are not necessarily the "good guys," they don't get "hired" for their adventures, and they're not generally looking to make the world a better place. Submitting generic 3.5 "save the day" adventure ideas will decrease your chances of getting to write one. There are plenty of resources out there to give you a feel for the Society: the <a href="/pathfinderSociety/scenarios/v5748btpy84k4">Guide to Pathfinder Society Organized Play</a>, <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/riseOfTheRunelords/v5748btpy7zkr"><i>Pathfinder</i> #1</a>, and the <a href="/pathfinder/pathfinderChronicles/v5748btpy84eo"><i>Pathfinder Chronicles Campaign Setting</i></a> all have information on the Pathfinder Society.</p> 
               <p>3. Read one or two scenarios before submitting (particularly 29 through 32).</p> 
               <p>4. Pathfinder Society Scenarios must be no more offensive than PG-13. Scenarios are played in public at public settings and children will be playing them. Submissions that include violence toward children will be auto-rejected.</p> 
               <p>5. This is not a contest. This is more like an interview for a job—you're showing me your best idea and I'm deciding if the combination of your idea and writing skill equals you being selected as our next scenario author. We need authors—not winners. And I really want to stress the <i>author</i> part of that. Only send me your best work that is reflective of your writing style. I can teach someone the rules system—I can't teach someone to write.</p> 
               <p>6. I don't have time to return every submission with feedback. Feel free to post your rejected proposals to the Pathfinder Society messageboards for peer review. For those of you not submitting, please give feedback to those who do and are rejected.</p> 
               <p>7. Lastly, I posted some general feedback on recent submissions <a href="http://paizo.com/paizo/messageboards/paizoPublishing/pathfinder/pathfinderSociety/scenarioSubmissionTalk/scenarioSubmissionAdvice">here</a>. Please read that thread before submitting.</p> 
              </blockquote> 
              <p>Rules for submitting Pathfinder Society scenario outlines are as follows:</p> 
              <blockquote> 
               <p>1. Based on the guidelines for the current round, write a 750-word outline that includes the following:</p>
               <blockquote> 
                <p>a. A title (if necessary, some times they are already titled)<br> b. A brief introduction that acts as a prologue for the scenario<br> c. A brief summary of how the PCs proceed through each encounter<br> d. A brief summary of each encounter—minimum six encounters with one encounter detailed as optional<br> e. A brief conclusion—what happens if the PCs fail or succeed</p>
               </blockquote>
               <p></p> 
               <p>2. By the due date, email your outline to josh@paizo.com with the subject line <b>SCENARIO NAME_SCENARIO#_ YOURLASTNAME</b>. Your summary must be in a MS Word document, or a Plain Text or Rich Text Format file—these are files ending in <b>.doc</b>, <b>.txt</b>, or <b>.rtf</b>. Your file must be titled SCENARIO NAME_SCENARIO#_LAST NAME, i.e., PerilsofthePiratePact_17_Dayon.</p> 
               <p>3. Include your full legal name, email address, physical mailing address, and a contact phone number at the top of your submission—this text does <i>not</i> count toward your word count. </p> 
               <p>4. Please allow 72 hours for a response before resending your submission. </p>
              </blockquote> 
              <p>The current open call is for Pathfinder Society scenario 43—one of the February 2010 releases. The full schedule for this submission period is as follows:</p> 
              <ul> 
               <li>9/17/09—Open call begins</li> 
               <li>10/2/09—Submissions due by 11:59 P.M. Pacific Time</li> 
               <li>10/12/09 through 10/16/09—Submissions review completed—selections and rejections notified</li>
              </ul> 
              <p><b>Guidelines</b></p> 
              <p>**<b>SPOILER ALERT: Do not read the guidelines below if you wish to avoid spoilers for upcoming scenarios.</b>**</p>

              <p>Greetings from the new Paizo caverns! As the newest addition to the war party, it falls on me to write today's blog. I am Crystal, and yes, I am named after a shiny rock. We can all thank my grandfather and his love of all things shiny.</p> 
              <p>When I first met the very talented Sarah Robinson in a hotel restroom and asked her about layout and design, I never expected that to turn into a real internship, let alone a job. My own experience in production work has been limited, but my enthusiasm, wit, and mastery of fire have impressed the Paizo staff enough to bring me into the fold.</p> 
              <p>It's hardly surprising, of course. Much of my life has been spent gaming or burning down peasant villages, the two skills the gaming industry demands.</p> 
              <p>My first experiences with roleplaying come from junior high, where I was none-too-politely barred from joining the gaming club for 1) being a girl, 2) never having played before, and 3) mauling the faculty advisor (see issue #1 and #2). My first play experience came in high school, thanks to Palladium Books' <i>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Other Strangeness.</i> As a poor country goblin, I didn't even have my own fancy dice; instead I used paper lunch sacks. I filled them with numbered chits, and just drew my results instead of rolling for them. Some days I miss my "b20." Since then, games have filled my life, even to the point of writing and developing a few projects for small companies. Some of the stellar games I obsess over include Green Ronin's <a href="/store/games/roleplayingGames/m/mutantsMasterminds" target="nofollow"><i>Mutants and Masterminds</i></a>, Wizards of the Coast's <a href="/store/byCompany/w/wizardsOfTheCoast/featuredBrands/d20modern" target="nofollow"><i>d20 Modern</i></a> and <a href="/store/byCompany/w/wizardsOfTheCoast/byProductType/roleplayingGames/dungeonsDragons/3rdEdition/environmentalGuidebooks/v5748btpy7b33" target="nofollow"><i>Ghostwalk</i></a>, <i>Hijinks</i> (created by Paizo for <a href="/store/downloads/dungeon/v5748btpy7z7f" target="nofollow"><i>Polyhedron</i> #158</a>), and Margaret Weiss's <a href="/store/byCompany/m/margaretWeisProductions/serenityRPG" target="nofollow"><i>Serenity RPG</i></a>, as well as the obscure and unheard-of <a href="/pathfinderRPG" target="nofollow"><i>Pathfinder RPG</i></a>.</p> 
              <p>My mastery of fire is a meandering, unlikely tale and will need to wait for another day.</p> 
              <p>Working with the Paizo crew is exciting; these are some of the best writers, developers, and designers in the industry, and they work hard at jobs they love. Never have I seen such dedication in any career that did not include the words "chocolate factory" or "brewery." The offices themselves are delightfully non-Euclidean, and I've learned the hard way to keep my distance from the impossible corners and ignore the whispers.</p> 
              <p>As a production assistant, I help fill in the cracks and manage the grunt work for Paizo's savage art directors, James Davis and Sarah Robinson. This usually means managing the digital archives, making changes the editors want, and topping off the coffee. The harder I work, the easier it is for James and Sarah to weave their arcane rituals, transforming the mad, gibbering scrawls the editors create into those glorious Pathfinder and Gamemastery products we all know and love. Also, twice a week I descend into the sub-basement and feed the cave-raptors, lest their terrible hungers overwhelm them and they rampage through the offices, making books late. </p> 
              <p>And none of this would be possible if I hadn't worked up the nerve to talk to Sarah about learning the layout arts. So remember, if you really want to work for Paizo Publishing, the secret is propositioning someone in the bathroom!*</p>

              <h1><br>Setting the Stage</h1> 
              <p class="date">Friday, September 4, 2009</p> 
              <p>In <a href="/pathfinderAdventurePaths/councilOfThieves/v5748btpy87da"><i>Pathfinder #26</i></a>, we try something a little different. During the course of Richard Pett's "The Sixfold Trial" the PCs find themselves involved in the diabolical performance of a notorious play. It's a pretty neat idea that really gives the PCs an opportunity to show their stuff off the battlefield and gives players with a flair for the dramatic a real chance to shine. Yet rather than skim over this focal point of the adventure with just a few hand waves and Perform checks, we did something a little crazy.</p> 
              <p>We commissioned the text of the entire play.</p> 
              <p>And we did it from theatrically-minded madman Nick Logue.</p> 
              <p> What we got was <i>The Six Trials of Larazod</i>, a performance piece for you to read, roleplay, act out, and include however you and your group pleases, along with rules on how to integrate the work with (or exclude it from) the main adventure. I'm proud to say it's one of the most appropriately avant-garde pieces of game design I've ever seen. And it's headed your way in just a few weeks here. But to tempt you with what's in store, here's the introduction to the first work of literature to come to you directly from Golarion. Also, expect a very distinctive look for the play from artist Sara Otterstätter, like the title piece you see here.</p> 
              <p> <i>The Six Trials of Larazod</i> is the fictional account of a Chelish tiefling named Larazod Rilsane. Larazod receives a vision from Asmodeus in which the dark god unveils a prominent Chelish magistrate—the sinister Paraduke Montigny Haanderthan—as a traitor to Cheliax, who has compacted with demonic powers and plans to bring the worship of Asmodeus to a sharp and brutal end. Burning with unholy justice and diabolical purpose, Larazod, along with his stalwart companions, sets out to expose the highly placed traitor Haanderthan. They are greatly overmatched, as Larazod is a minor scion of a piddling noble house whose influence lies tattered in the wake of Thrune's seizure of power in Cheliax. Undaunted, Larazod vows a smoldering blood oath to Asmodeus to see the traitor fall before Haanderthan's actions bring the dark glory of Cheliax low.</p> 
              <p>So bone up on your Shakespeare and get ready for rehearsals—tryouts for <i>The Six Trials of Larazod</i> are just around the corner!</p>

              <p><i>Pathfinder Chronicles: Seekers of Secrets</i> was delayed a long time, probably because of several nasty curses brought on by too-curious chroniclers into forbidden lore. The book is finally out the door, which means it's time for some previews! This time it's an excerpt from one of the book's many biographies of notable Pathfinders and a hint about how some powerful individuals bind their <i>ioun stones</i> to their flesh to keep these treasures safe.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><b>Eliza Petulengro</b>: Absalom's newest venture-captain hails from war-torn Galt. She is a talented diviner with a photographic memory for text, names, and faces. Soft-spoken and polite, she has a pleasant habit of calling initiates by name even after meeting them only once. Though she appears bookish, this is just a facade to deter suitors and keep her affairs private.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><b>Implanting Ioun Stones</b>: Not all the secrets of the <i>ioun stones</i> lie with the Azlanti. While the First Humans mastered the intrinsic powers of the stones, uncovering new attributes and binding them to devices, the Thassilonians explored the interaction of <i>ioun stones</i> and the living mind and body, and in time devised a means of implanting an <i>ioun stone</i> within the flesh. This process, originally believed irreversible, protected the <i>ioun stone</i> from harm and theft while still providing its full powers to the owner.</p>
