  \ \n    <p>A decade ago Paizo had me write <a href=\"/products/btpy87uz?Pathfinder-Chronicles-The-Great-Beyond-A-Guide-to-the-Multiverse\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: The Great Beyond</em></a> exploring Pathfinder's\
  \ cosmology and fleshing out its outsiders as something unique as it branched off\
  \ as its own game. Since then, the cosmology has evolved and expanded, with such\
  \ really cool additions as psychopomps, divs, and sakhils, the <em>Book of the Damned</em>\
  \ series, and other resources.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\

  \ most of the past decade I've pleaded to see a planar hardcover for Pathfinder,\
  \ and the begging finally paid off! As one of <a href=\"/products/btpya1am?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Planar-Adventures\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder RPG Planar Adventures</em></a>' freelancers I can't wait to see\
  \ it released for you folks who've been asking for this for just as long as I have.\
  \ So what do you have to look forward to? Here's a list of some of my favorite things\
  \ in Planar Adventures:</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\">\n     <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20180605-IlsetsyaWyrmtouched.jpg\"\

  ></a> \n     <p><i>Illustration by Gabriela Marchioro</i></p>\n    </div> \n   \
  \ <ol> \n     <li>The original <i>Great Beyond</i> was a solo project for me, but\
  \ Planar Adventures let me collaborate with some seriously talented folks and get\
  \ their awesome ideas into play. For me, it's like jumping out of bed, running downstairs,\
  \ and feverishly opening up Christmas gifts, beyond excited at what you might find\
  \ and having it all be a wonderful surprise.</li> \n     <li>Galisemni, the City\
  \ of the Celestial and the Damned, originally showed up as only a name on the map\
  \ of the Maelstrom, but for years it was the primary setting of my home Pathfinder\
  \ campaign, and I'm incredibly excited to finally detail it. May the Watching Seven\
  \ grant you favor, may the Lethe Wall not covet your name unless fate holds that\
  \ in store, and whatever you do, don't get into a drinking contest with Il'setsya\
  \ Wyrmtouched (ganzi arcanist, itinerant drunkard, pesh-connoisseur, and my PC when\
  \ I played in Rise of the Runelords). This is my favorite location that I've ever\
  \ created in any RPG supplement ever, and I'm proud to add it into the game and\
  \ see what you folks do with it!</li> \n     <li>Shadow Absalom was another planar\
  \ city originally from <i>The Great Beyond</i> and it and the Shadow Plane get additional\
  \ detail herein. What plots does the great wyrm Argrinyxia, the Shifting Lady of\
  \ Ebon Scales, spin? What mysteries lurk within the gloom for your PCs to find?\
  \ Do you dare explore a landscape twisted by Zon-Kuthon's own dreams and nightmares?</li>\
  \ \n     <li>The Negative Energy Plane is one of the most criminally underused planes,\
  \ but here it shines, darkly so. Avoid the plane's native sceaduinar, the so-called\
  \ raptors of the void, and take shelter from the Void's horrific natural hazards\
  \ from the macabre (relative) safety of Malikar's Keep. Plumb the hungry, lightless\
  \ depths for such legendary locations as Fallen Duromak, a Material planet swallowed\
  \ and lost, or the enigmatic, manifest horror of Eternity's Doorstep that hideously\
  \ feeds upon the undead. <em>Planar Adventures</em> provides reasons to visit each\
  \ plane, flavor to inspire, and a myriad of locations to send PCs.</li> \n     <li>Really\
  \ cool NPCs: Ssila'meshnik the Colorless Lord (protean lord of fate, freedom, and\
  \ paradox); a deific information for The Speakers of the Depths; Inusalia the meladaemon\
  \ alchemist and her cross-planar pesh emporium who harvests the souls of repeat\
  \ clients to sate her own addiction; Jacarkas the Collector, harbinger thrall of\
  \ Trelmarixian and lord of Abaddon's slave city of Awaiting-Consumption; and many\
  \ more!</li> \n    </ol> \n    <p>This book was a joy and a privilege to work on\
  \ and soon it will be in your hands! Enjoy, have fun, and don't blame me if proteans\
  \ eat your PCs.</p> \n    <p>Todd Stewart<br> <i>Contributor</i></p> \n   </div>\
