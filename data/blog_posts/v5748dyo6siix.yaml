  \     </div>\n     <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\"><em>As I continue\
  \ reading through the Godsrain “prophecies,” I have begun to develop a troubling\
  \ new theory about their origin. I will admit up front that this idea may seem more\
  \ in line with one of those </em>Another Absalom<em> tales of spies and skullduggery\
  \ than a scholarly review (though I have always believed that those tales should\
  \ be studied for their ability to keep the reader’s attention, something we researchers\
  \ often do not do as successfully as we would like!), but I’ve noticed that several\
  \ of the prophecies seem to strike at the core of what many think about the divine.\
  \ This is not to say that gods cannot die, or falter, or fail in some way, but the\
  \ more I read these documents, the more I can imagine negative outcomes that I might\
  \ once have dismissed as distant possibilities. What if this is deliberate?</em></p>\n\
  \      <p><em>Perhaps the author of these works is no prophet at all, but someone\
  \ who seeks to weaken what we understand of divinity. I am not certain who or what\
  \ would seek that as an outcome, but any entity that benefits from faltering faith\
  \ is one that cannot have the best interests of Golarion at heart. Still, if I am\
  \ being candid, the thought of some mysterious villain appeals to me more than it\
  \ probably should. Perhaps I simply wish to find a reason for these prophecies outside\
  \ of any potential truth I might find in their pages. Or perhaps I have stumbled\
  \ onto a workable theory. I will note the thought, but only as one of many I might\
  \ bring to my Lady. False comfort can too often be found within visions of conspiracy.</em></p>\n\

  \      <h2>The Death of Nethys</h2>\n      <p>Mind. Matter. Spirit. Life. Four essences.\
  \ Four building blocks. Four cornerstones whose intersections shape the way that\
  \ magic works. And in that four, two pairs that are too different to be joined together.\
  \ Matter never blends with Spirit; Mind and Life remain apart. Nethys knows the\
  \ truth of this, but never quite believes it fully. (Is he not the proof that there\
  \ is power in duality?)</p>\n      <p>As the centuries progress, he keeps returning\
  \ to this quandary, tells himself that he alone can meld the two opposing pairs.\
  \ He can be the font of knowledge. He can give the world new magic. He can take\
  \ the contradictions, put them through a transformation. He can start two new traditions.\
  \ Mind and Body. Heart and Soul.</p>\n      <p>Does he succeed? Perhaps he does.\
  \ Perhaps he stands awash with pride, his fingers trembling at the feeling, ready\
  \ to share something of the magic he has wrought. But if he feels triumphant, it\
  \ is only for a moment—a breath of jubilation as he soaks himself in magic, followed\
  \ by a cry of horror as his body falls apart. Nethys, by sheer will and power, holds\
  \ himself together briefly, fractures crawling down his arms, breaking him to pieces\
  \ like a chunk of splintered glass. He remains alive just long enough to see the\
  \ power of his folly, spreading from his fingers to the very building blocks of\
  \ magic, tearing them asunder as his body turns to ash.</p>\n      <p>In an instant,\
  \ magic changes—bends and rips and stretches thin, settling like a shredded cloth\
  \ pulled tight across the world. Where it is torn, all magic ceases. Long-held items\
  \ lose their power. Spells are nothing more than words. Spellcasters within these\
  \ hollows lose all tether to their magic, even if they only cross the boundary in\
  \ the aftermath. Some regain their skills with time, but others never quite recover,\
  \ every magic word they utter turned to dust between their lips. Some don’t even\
  \ make it that far, dying when the magic ends, falling from the skies above, losing\
  \ shields that keep them safe, gulping down a healing potion turned to flavored\
  \ water.</p>\n      <p>At first, the new uncertainty inspires mass devotion, but\
  \ there is little solace from the other gods. Pharasma asks for a report. Irori\
  \ swears to make it right. Their followers still cannot cast a single spell within\
  \ the hollows. And those who lose the taste for magic, prayers dying in their mouth?\
  \ They do not seem to gain a thing from all their dedication.</p>\n      <p>For\
  \ those who never cared for magic, hollows are a place of refuge, leveling the playing\
  \ field in favor of the fist and sword. Many flock who follow Nethys, loyal to his\
  \ knowledge still, believing this to be some test that leads them to a new reward.</p>\n\
  \      <p>Many on Golarion relocate from their hollowed homes, fearing what it means\
  \ to lose the magic in their lives. But travel is no easy thing, not even with the\
  \ scout and map and herbal kits (now free of magical augmentations) that have become\
  \ requirements for any trip outside. Rumors abound of hidden dangers scattered through\
  \ the Great Beyond: places where the magic varies, strong one day and weak the next,\
  \ turning one night’s cantrip to the morning’s deadly strike; villages consumed\
  \ by all the magic stolen from the world, drowning in a power they have no way to\
  \ unmake.</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/84aa7bf1-3b05-4524-89b7-2684855bb81e/EvolvingProhecyImage_Wk6_1300x2000.jpg\"\

  \ style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Magic is so fundamental to our reality that the thought\
  \ of its absence or unreliability on a multiplanar scale is nearly as unfathomable\
  \ as the concept of Nethys’s own ambition being magic’s undoing!</p>\n      </div>\n\
  \      <br>\n      <p><em>Magic has never been among my preferred subjects to study,\
  \ but I now wish I’d learned more of it! It would help me to properly evaluate what,\
  \ if anything, within this prophecy is truly feasible. Could one death (even the\
  \ death of a god) create this level of chaos within such a fundamental part of life?\
  \ This prophecy seems to indicate that magic is forever changed by Nethys’s actions,\
  \ but even a disaster of the magnitude described seems unlikely to change fundamental\
  \ principles of magic (a statement I would be much more convinced of were I sure\
  \ that I fully understood them). While I doubt that this prophecy would come true,\
  \ I am now curious if there are any projects that Nethys has undertaken that might\
  \ lead to his attempting something on this scale. Perhaps I judged too quickly,\
  \ and these are less dastardly plot than desperate warning? I need more information\
  \ to be sure.</em></p>\n      <center>\n       <br>\n       <hr width=\"75%\">\n\
