  \ blog from Times Square in New York City, where I'm staying while taking in New\
  \ York Comic Con. NYCC is one of my favorite events of the year. For starters, the\
  \ convention is the second largest event of its kind, bringing in more than 100,000\
  \ fans from all over the world. The show floor is like a marketplace out of a geek's\
  \ dreams, filled with action figures old and new, original comic art, wandering\
  \ nerd culture celebrities, back issues, original art, you name it. It's like four\
  \ Gen Cons smooshed together, with an artist's alley off to the side that fills\
  \ a room that could host most conventions. There aren't, alas, a lot of tabletop\
  \ (or even video) game companies exhibiting at the show yet, but the fandoms are\
  \ very, very similar and of course there's a ton of crossover with gamers. For me\
  \ it's a chance to visit with East Coast business partners like Dynamite, publishers\
  \ of the <a href=\"/pathfinder/comics\">Pathfinder Comics</a> range, as well as\
  \ most of our book business distribution partners.</p> \n    <p>It's also among\
  \ my favorites because it's the final convention of the year. For 2014 that makes\
  \ it sixteen conventions or trade shows for me, and I have to admit I am exhausted.\
  \ I always try to jam all of my business meetings into the first couple of days\
  \ of the show, so I can enjoy wandering the floor as a fan myself. After focusing\
  \ all of my convention attention on business from January until the end of October,\
  \ it's important for me to spend a little while checking out all of the stuff that\
  \ I geek out over. It's fun to get in touch with my own fannish soul, and at the\
  \ very end of the convention season, just when I should be running out of gas, I\
  \ find that New York Comic Con invigorates me, recharging my batteries for the year\
  \ ahead.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20141010-NYCC.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> \n     <p><i>NECA, the parent company of WizKids, have an awesome\
  \ Pathfinder Battles display in their NYCC booth,<br>complete with some <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy96kb\"><i>Lost Coast</i></a> figures including the case incentive\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy96k7\">Shemhazian Demon</a>!</i></p>\n    </div> \n  \
  \  <p>Among the things that most tickle my nerdy fancy? Miniatures, of course! So\
  \ let us turn our giggling, geeky hearts to three more paint masters for the upcoming\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy98sw\"><i>Iconic Heroes Set #1</i></a>!</p> \n    <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20141010-Seelah.jpg\"\
  > <img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20141010-Seelah_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Here we have Seelah, Human Paladin, our favorite champion\
  \ of law and good. Seelah received one of the earliest representation of an iconic\
  \ character in our regular <a href=\"/pathfinder/battles\">Pathfinder Battles</a>\
  \ line, appearing in the very first set, <a href=\"/products/btpy8mq6\"><i>Heroes\
  \ &amp; Monsters</i></a>. That figure was fine—even impressive—for that early stage\
  \ in the product line, but I never felt that it quite lived up to the early high\
  \ standards set by the <a href=\"/products/btpy8l52\"><i>Beginner Box Heroes</i></a>\
  \ set, which predated <a href=\"/pathfinder/battles\">Pathfinder Battles</a> itself\
  \ by a few months. It also had a bit of a scaling issue relative to other human\
  \ figures, and came across as a bit small, not quite the imposing, powerful warrior\
  \ we were hoping for.</p> \n    <p>I'm pleased to report that this new version of\
  \ Seelah more than fits the bill. This version is considerably different from her\
  \ original presentation, most notably in that the paladin wears her helm in this\
  \ incarnation. That helm plays an important part in <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5la39\"\
  >Seelah's origin story</a>, so we thought it fitting to send the warrior into battle\
  \ in her full regalia.</p> \n    <p>The shield appears white for now, but will soon\
  \ get a tampo stamp with a crisp image of the holy symbol of Iomedae, Seelah's honorable\
  \ goddess.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20141010-Sajan.jpg\"\
  > <img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20141010-Sajan_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Sajan, Human Monk is another example, in my opinion,\
  \ of improving a figure on the second attempt. The original <a href=\"/products/btpy92jw\"\
  >Sajan figure</a> looked pretty cool and didn't have any major flaws like scaling\
  \ issues, but this new pose is so much better it automatically gives the newer model\
  \ the edge. I love his battle-ready pose, and even his expression impresses.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>While quality control at the production facility—something both WizKids\
  \ and Paizo have repeatedly stressed for the Iconic Heroes line—will tell the tale\
  \ when the final paint is applied, the new digital sculpting process allows for\
  \ much finer and more interesting facial details than practical sculpts. From Valeros's\
  \ smirk to Seelah's combat expression to Sajan's glare, these guys have real expression\
  \ in their faces. It feels like a step forward for the line.</p> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20141010-Droogami.jpg\"\
  > <img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20141010-Droogami_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>We last met Lini the druid's snow leopard, Droogami,\
  \ in the <a href=\"/products/btpy909j\"><i>Legends of Golarion</i></a> set, where\
  \ it was called simply <a href=\"/products/btpy92je\">Snow Leopard</a>. Since then,\
  \ we've given Lini's feline friend a sweet set of armor. We've also given it a somewhat\
  \ realistic face—a first for the many great cats produced so far in the line, most\
  \ of which seemed to end up with slightly comedic faces, like scary animals mixed\
  \ with breakfast cereal mascots. I think this is a step up.</p> \n    <p>So there\
  \ you have it. Three new figures, three improvements on their original appearances.\
  \ I call that a win, and look forward to showing off the next set!</p> \n    <p>But\
  \ before we can do THAT, we've got one matter of outstanding business for November's\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy96kb\"><i>The Lost Coast</i></a> set! I forgot to preview\
  \ one last figure for the set. I'd held off because I didn't think the picture did\
  \ the figure justice. Then I saw the replacement picture, which was blurry and even\
  \ worse. Then I went back to the original picture.</p> \n    <p>Here she is:</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20141010-ElfArcher.jpg\"\
  > <img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20141010-ElfArcher_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>This is the Elf Archer, who looks better in person than\
  \ she does in our photo. She's based on one of my favorite pieces of art from the\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy8v3a\"><i>NPC Codex</i></a>. She's a nice addition to\
  \ our fairly limited ranks of elves in <a href=\"/pathfinder/battles\">Pathfinder\
  \ Battles</a> so far. And if you're going to have an elf, it seems natural to make\
  \ it an archer. The Elf Archer is a Medium, common figure.</p> \n    <p>And with\
  \ that, I'm heading back to the convention! Enjoy your weekend, wherever you are,\
  \ and we'll see you back here in a week for more exciting reveals!</p> \n    <p>Erik\
