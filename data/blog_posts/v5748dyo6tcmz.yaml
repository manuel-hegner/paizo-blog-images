  \ Gorum, war runs rampant across the world. The nations of Golarion clash over border\
  \ disputes, natural resources, and ideological differences. For such grand conflicts\
  \ (as well as your typical dungeon encounters), we introduce two new classes who\
  \ can help turn the tide of any battle.</p>\n      <p>The commander is an Intelligence-based\
  \ tactician with unparalleled authority over the battlefield. By drilling specific\
  \ tactics with your allies during your daily preparations, you can signal them with\
  \ your unfurled banner during a fight to take additional actions. Call for a Defensive\
  \ Retreat to allow each of your squadmates to Step up to three times (away from\
  \ enemies, of course) as a free action. Using the Double Team tactic to allow a\
  \ squadmate with an opponent in reach to Shove or Reposition that foe as a free\
  \ action. If they are successful and move that creature adjacent to you or a different\
  \ squadmate, you or that squadmate can Strike that opponent as a reaction. The commander\
  \ is no slouch in the fight themself, being trained in martial weapons and all armors,\
  \ so if you want to lead your fellow adventurers to victory, be sure to playtest\
  \ the commander!</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/f8e9780e-fbb3-4e4a-a34f-292eb1598596/PZO1138_Commander_1500x2000.png\"\

  \      </div>\n      <br>\n      <p>The guardian is a Strength-based protector who\
  \ excels in the use of armor, both for their own benefit and the aid of others.\
  \ You gain the effects of armor specialization at 1st level, and you can also Intercept\
  \ Strikes meant for your allies, taking the hit but gaining resistance against that\
  \ damage. Because of your armor, you’ll be a little more difficult to hit than your\
  \ friends, so what’s to stop monsters from simply ignoring you? Your Taunts! By\
  \ Taunting a foe, you make yourself a more tempting target and impart penalties\
  \ to their attacks on anyone else. If you are the type of player who enjoys keeping\
  \ others safe from harm, be sure to playtest the guardian!</p>\n      <div class=\"\
