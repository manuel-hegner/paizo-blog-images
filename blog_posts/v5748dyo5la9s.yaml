  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, April 21, 2009</p> \n   <p>The <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderChronicles/v5748btpy84eo\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Chronicles Campaign Setting</i></a> gave readers a glimpse of the\
  \ tortuous layers of Hell and the diabolical machinations of the archdevils who\
  \ rule them, and <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderChronicles/v5748btpy84bb\"><i>The\
  \ Great Beyond, A Guide to the Multiverse</i></a>, scheduled to be released in June,\
  \ will further whet the appetites of those who crave to add a healthy dose of the\
  \ infernal to their game. The definitive treatise on Hell, however, is being written\
  \ by none other than Paizo's own F. Wesley Schneider: <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderChronicles/v5748btpy85jm\"\
  ><i>Princes of Darkness—Book of the Damned</i>, Volume 1</a>. I had the chance to\
  \ speak to Wes recently about the sources he consulted when writing this daunting\
  \ tome, and how he managed to reconcile the mythological roots of Hell with the\
  \ lore of previous editions of the game.</p> \n   <p><b>Wes</b>: \"The two primary\
  \ sources of inspiration are obvious: Milton’s <i>Paradise Lost</i> and Dante’s\
  \ <i>Inferno</i>. Other influential real-world sources included the <i>Lesser Key\
  \ of Solomon</i>—and the <i>Dictionnaire Infernal</i>.</p> \n   <p>\"The problem\
  \ is these sources have been used over and over in the game and in third-party supplements.\
  \ The way the entries for individual demons are written in the <i>Lesser Key</i>,\
  \ for example, they already sound as if they were appearing in RPG products. I tried\
  \ to avoid using the entries that have been bandied about the game frequently, as\
  \ they've had enough coverage already. I didn't want to use too many of the fiends\
  \ from mythology that have already appeared in products like Necromancer's <i>Tome\
  \ of Horrors</i> and Green Ronin's <i>Book of Fiends</i>, as they have lives and\
  \ details of their own. The 1st Edition <i>Monster Manual II</i> has a list of names\
  \ of demons—some are made up and so we can't use them, but the ones from obscure\
  \ mythology were perfect.</p> \n   <p>\"The problem with Hell, in my opinion, is\
  \ that it is the red-headed step-child to the Abyss. Whereas the Abyss is infinitely\
  \ large, full of an infinitely diverse number of cool monsters, Hell has been stereotyped\
  \ as a place of boring rigidity ruled over by scary-looking dudes with whips and\
  \ pitchforks and goatees. When I wrote <i>The Book of the Damned</i>, I wanted to\
  \ get rid of these stereotypes, and to make the archdevils actually monsters, because\
  \ that would be much cooler than just generic cackling overlords. I tried to draw\
  \ on the mythology that was already established for them but make them more like\
  \ monsters. A good example is Geryon—in the original game he was just a snake man\
  \ with a spear. Classical Greek mythology, however, portrays him as a warrior possessing\
  \ a human form from waist down, but with three torsos and six arms. For <i>The Book\
  \ of the Damned</i> I mixed the both the mythological and game interpretations of\
  \ Geryon into something at the same time evocative of past images, but still new\
  \ and very cool.</p> \n   <p>\"The biggest differences between the Pathfinder version\
  \ of Hell and the classic interpretation in the game is that we play up the \"law\
  \ and order\" aspect—it's more about tyrants and the hierarchy of Hell, in that\
  \ while Hell is first and foremost a punishment, it also has a goal and intention,\
  \ and the personalities there are ancient and have neat concepts behind them. Beyond\
  \ just Asmodeus and the archdevils, there is a whole host of deity-like beings:\
  \ infernal dukes (of whom there is unlimited room for further development and details),\
  \ malebranche (powerful diabolical warlords sent out to conquer specific worlds),\
  \ and a few other tiers I’ll save as surprises for the final book. The biggest thing\
  \ is that there is a lot going on and it's interesting, and it sticks to both the\
  \ lore of the game and the mythological roots; it also draws on interesting history\
  \ of deities that have been subsumed by other religions.\"</p> \n   <p>Stay tuned\
  \ for Part 2 of \"Roots &amp; Beginnings: Book of the Damned\"!</p> \n   <p>David\
