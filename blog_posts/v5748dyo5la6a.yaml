  \ Pathfinder Journal</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Monday, July 2, 2007</p> \n   <p>When\
  \ we first came up with the outline for a typical volume of <a href=\"/pathfinder\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder</i></a>, there were several key things we wanted to make sure made\
  \ it into every book. There had to be an adventure, of course, and several supporting\
  \ articles giving background material that specifically expanded the adventure.\
  \ There had to be an introduction that gave people a look behind the scenes, pregenerated\
  \ characters, and numerous new monsters that could be easily dropped into that volume's\
  \ adventure or a homebrew campaign. But there was still something missing—a space\
  \ for us to shade in more of our world beyond just the current adventure's location.\
  \ A narrative that would help get people invested and allow us to explore and expand,\
  \ reconcepting established monsters for our setting and breathing that much more\
  \ life into the world as a whole.</p> \n   <p>To this end, we created the Pathfinder\
  \ Journal. Each month in <i>Rise of the Runelords</i>, we'll follow the journal\
  \ of Eando Kline, a neophyte member of the Pathfinder organization, as he adventures\
  \ through the region of Varisia, recording the knowledge he uncovers and sending\
  \ it back to his venture-captain superior in hopes of one day being deemed worthy\
  \ of publication in the illustrious Pathfinder Chronicles.</p> \n   <p>While Pathfinder\
  \ Journals will normally be presented in-character as musings and naturalist-style\
  \ sketches from Kline's logs, \"Opening Moves,\" the initial installment that appears\
  \ in <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7xpr\">\"Burnt Offerings\"</a> breaks the mold before\
  \ its even been established. In this first taste, Erik Mona sets the scene by presenting\
  \ an in-depth background of the Pathfinder organization—its goals, leadership, and\
  \ place in the myriad societies of Golarion. Steal a taste of the hidden knowledge\
  \ that rests inside the much-coveted chronicles, and study the creeds by which all\
  \ pathfinders must abide.</p> \n   <p>All of which will prepare you for volume two,\
  \ in which Jason Bulmahn presents the first chapter in the wanderings of Eando Kline,\
  \ pathfinder extraordinaire....</p> \n   <p>James Sutter <br>Assistant Editor, <i>Pathfinder</i></p>\
