  artist: "far!\" And why shouldn't it be? Though these days he's best known as the\
    \ literary agent for Robert E. Howard and supposed rival of Edgar Rice Burroughs,\
    \ at the height of the pulp era Kline was nearly as big a name as Howard and Burroughs\
    \ himself. Though Kline's famous feud with Burroughs—in which Burroughs would\
    \ publish a Mars book so Kline would publish a Venus one, prompting Burroughs\
    \ to publish a Venus one, which in turn forced Kline to respond with a Mars saga,\
    \ etc.—turns out to have been entirely the creation of imaginative fans, there\
    \ can be no doubt that the two authors shared both style and subject matter. Indeed,\
    \ Kline has frequently been called Burroughs's only true competitor. While he\
    \ produced only a handful of novels before his death at the age of 55, Kline's\
    \ presence on the original editorial staff of Weird Tales and his sword-swinging\
    \ romances on the red and green planets did much to influence the genre, and his\
    \ legacy lives on in the tradition of sword and planet novels to this day. So\
    \ will our grand experiment work? Can we fulfill the promise we made to our readers,\
    \ not just to give them fun, historically significant works of fantasy and science\
    \ fiction, but to give them great stories that they've never heard of before?\
    \ Are today's audiences open to the Burroughsian derring-do of characters like\
    \ Harry Thorne, the swashbuckling, Depression-era dynamo sent to the Red Planet\
    \ in The Swordsman of Mars? Buckle your seatbelts, folks. We're about to find\
