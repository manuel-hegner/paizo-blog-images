  ><em>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Adventurer's Guide</em></a> notes that any material\
  \ that changed when it appeared in this book (and underwent several additional rounds\
  \ of development) would be the default version once the book's contents appear on\
  \ the <a href=\"/prd\">Pathfinder Reference Document</a>. Until then, we've let\
  \ both versions remain legal, for we're not going to institute a change that requires\
  \ someone to buy another book to use a previously legal character. When we made\
  \ that Additional Resources update, we expected the PRD would appear soon afterward.\
  \ It's looking like it will be a while yet before it shows up, and consternation\
  \ about one of the archetypes in particular—the lore warden—has been building enough\
  \ that we're resolving it today.</p> \n     <p><b>Officially Updated:</b> The <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy9sjo?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Adventurers-Guide\"><em>Adventurer's\
  \ Guide</em></a> version of the lore warden becomes the sole version used in Pathfinder\
  \ Society Roleplaying Guild on <b>October 18, 2017</b>. Aim to update your characters\
  \ using the allowances below before the next time you play a character with fighter\
  \ (lore warden) levels. This change doesn't become binding for two weeks, which\
  \ allows you some time to make adjustments and doesn't require you to perform any\
  \ modifications before your imminent game or convention.</p> \n     <p><b>Full Rebuild:</b>\
  \ If your character had one or more levels of lore warden on or <b>before August\
  \ 11th, 2017</b>, you can freely rebuild your character as you like. That includes\
  \ changing up basically anything about the character except the Chronicle sheets\
  \ you've assigned to them.</p> \n     <p><b>Partial Rebuild:</b> If your character\
  \ took their first level of fighter (lore warden) or otherwise retrained into the\
  \ lore warden archetype <b>after August 11, 2017 but before October 4, 2017</b>,\
  \ you can freely rebuild these recently-acquired fighter (lore warden) levels and\
  \ any other levels taken since; this includes any other character choices you've\
  \ made since then, such as feats, spells known, recent purchases, and the like.\
  \ If you adopted the archetype after this date through retraining, you may freely\
  \ retrain the archetype—removing it entirely or replacing it with one or more other\
  \ fighter archetypes.</p> \n     <p><b>Resources:</b> Both the <a href=\"/products/btpy8mfq?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Pathfinder-Society-Field-Guide%20\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Pathfinder Society Field Guild</i></a> and <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9sjo?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Adventurers-Guide\"><i>Adventurer's\
  \ Guide</i></a> are legal sources for the lore warden. If you own the former, simply\
  \ use the updated text from the <a href=\"/products/btpy9sjo?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Adventurers-Guide\"\
  ><i>Adventurer's Guide</i></a>, reprinted below.</p> \n     <blockquote> \n    \
  \  <h3>Lore Warden (Fighter Archetype)</h3> \n      <p>Quick wits and deceptive\
  \ techniques can often succeed where brute force might not. A lore warden is the\
  \ consummate warrior-scholar of the Pathfinder Society, outsmarting her competition\
  \ even when locking blades with powerful foes. Outside of combat, a lore warden's\
  \ extensive education also helps her document the past and survive great danger.</p>\
  \ \n      <p><b>Scholastic (Ex):</b> A lore warden gains 2 additional skill ranks\
  \ each level. These ranks must be spent on Intelligence- based skills. All Craft\
  \ and Knowledge skills are class skills for lore wardens, as are Linguistics and\
  \ Spellcraft.</p> \n      <p>This ability replaces the fighter's proficiency with\
  \ medium armor, heavy armor, and shields.</p> \n      <p><b>Skill Over Strength\
  \ (Ex):</b> At 2nd level, a lore warden qualifies for feats and other abilities\
  \ as though she had the Combat Expertise feat. At 6th level, she gains Combat Expertise\
  \ as a bonus feat, even if she would not normally qualify for the feat. If she already\
  \ has Combat Expertise, she instead gains any one combat feat that includes Combat\
  \ Expertise as a prerequisite (and for which she otherwise qualifies). At 10th level,\
  \ she can treat her base attack bonus as though it were 2 higher for the purpose\
  \ of calculating the effects of Combat Expertise.</p> \n      <p>This ability replaces\
  \ bravery and the fighter bonus feat gained at 2nd level.</p> \n      <p><b>Swords\
  \ Secret (Ex):</b> A lore warden learns specialized techniques that help her to\
  \ quickly analyze and defeat her foes. At 3rd level, a lore warden gains one swords\
  \ secret, and she gains an additional swords secret for every 4 fighter levels gained\
  \ after 3rd. Except where noted, a lore warden cannot select the same swords secret\
  \ more than once.</p> \n      <p><i>Exploit Weakness (Ex):</i> The lore warden adds\
  \ one-third her class level on attack rolls to confirm critical hits. At 11th level,\
  \ whenever she confirms a critical hit, her weapon attacks ignore the first 5 points\
  \ of damage reduction or hardness the target has until the end of her next turn.\
  \ At 19th level, the lore warden can automatically confirm a critical hit once per\
  \ round when she threatens a critical hit.</p> \n      <p><i>Hair's Breadth (Ex):</i>\
  \ Once per day when subject to a critical hit, the lore warden can attempt an Acrobatics\
  \ check to reduce the damage as an immediate action. If the result of this Acrobatics\
  \ check is greater than the opponent's confirmation roll, she negates the critical\
  \ hit; the attack still hits and deals normal damage. The lore warden must be at\
  \ least 11th level to select this swords secret. At 15th level she can use this\
  \ secret one additional time per day.</p> \n      <p><i>Know Thy Enemy (Ex):</i>\
  \ When the lore warden succeeds at a Knowledge check to identify a creature's abilities\
  \ and weaknesses, she can also use a standard action to grant herself a +2 insight\
  \ bonus on all attack and weapon damage rolls made against that enemy. This bonus\
  \ lasts for a number of rounds equal to half her class level (minimum 2 rounds),\
  \ or until the lore warden uses this ability against a different creature. At 11th\
  \ level, she also gains a +2 bonus to her AC against the creature when using this\
  \ ability. At 19th level, the insight bonus increases to +3.</p> \n      <p><i>Maneuver\
  \ Training (Ex):</i> The lore warden gains a brawler's maneuver training class feature,\
  \ treating her fighter level as her brawler level.</p> \n      <p><i>Swift Assessment\
  \ (Ex):</i> The lore warden can now use her know thy enemy swords secret as a move\
  \ action. At 15th level, she can use this ability as a swift action. She must have\
  \ the know thy enemy swords secret before choosing this swords secret.</p> \n  \
  \    <p>This replaces armor training and armor mastery.</p> \n     </blockquote>\
  \ \n     <p>The <b>enlightened bloodrager</b> and <b>Qadiran horselord</b> archetypes\
  \ are receiving the same treatment with two exceptions: we're not reprinting the\
  \ updated archetype text here (it will still await the PRD update), and the date\
  \ by which any updates need to happen will be based on when the PRD's updated. The\
  \ cut-off dates for partial and full rebuilds will be the same, however, as will\
  \ the legality of the respective previous sources for these archetypes. If you would\
  \ like to perform those rebuilds for characters with those archetypes now, you're\
  \ welcome to do so.</p> \n     <p>John Compton<br> <i>Organized Play Lead Developer</i></p>\
