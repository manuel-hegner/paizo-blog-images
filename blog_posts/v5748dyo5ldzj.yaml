  \  <p><span itemprop=\"description\">At the PaizoCon 2012 banquet, we announced\
  \ we've been working on Paizo Game Space, a virtual tabletop that runs right in\
  \ your web browser. We've shown some <a href=\"/paizo/blog/2012/july/v5748dyo5ldn1&amp;page=2?Paizo-announces-Paizo-Game-Space#84\"\
  >screenshots</a>, and clarified <a href=\"/paizo/blog/2012/july/v5748dyo5ldn1&amp;page=4?Paizo-announces-Paizo-Game-Space#180\"\
  >why we're doing this</a> (hint: it's <a href=\"/paizo/blog/2012/july/v5748dyo5ldn1&amp;page=4?Paizo-announces-Paizo-Game-Space#186\"\
  >not to crush our enemies</a>). But now it's been a few months, and the VTT isn't\
  \ available yet, so we'd like to give you an update on where we are and answer some\
  \ big questions: \"When can I use it?\" and \"How much will it cost?\"</span></p>\
  \ \n    <p><b>When can I use it? </b></p> \n    <p>We're going to be starting public\
  \ beta testing in the next few weeks. This beta test will be open to anybody who\
  \ bought a ticket online for PaizoCon 2012. This gives us a reasonably limited group\
  \ of people to bang on it and break the obvious stuff so we can fix it before opening\
  \ it up to everybody. Ideally, the beta test will last just a few weeks, but that\
  \ will depend on what breaks.</p> \n    <p><b>How much will it cost?</b></p> \n\
  \    <p>As we've said before, it'll be free to play. But we'll have ways for you\
  \ to give us money. Since we're talking about selling access to digital data, pretty\
  \ much anything is possible, but initially, we're focusing on maps, tokens and adventures.\
  \ </p> \n    <p>We've also settled on some basic principles:</p> \n    <ul>\n  \
  \   <li><b>If you buy it, you keep it.</b> That means no limited number of uses,\
  \ no monthly fees, no pay-per-play, no rentals. If you buy a token set for Paizo\
  \ Game Space, you can use those tokens whenever you like. Period. There's no extra\
  \ charge to use the same token in multiple games. You won't have to pay us again\
  \ next year to keep using it. And if you buy a campaign and want to run multiple\
  \ groups through it, you can do that, too.</li> \n     <li><b>If someone at the\
  \ table has it, everybody can see it.</b> Rather than make GMs have to purchase\
  \ <i>everything</i>, we think it's important for players to be able to help out.\
  \ So if Karzoug is running a campaign, and needs Flip-Mat: Country Inn, Merisiel\
  \ can just let him use hers.*</li>\n    </ul> \n    <p>So how much does that Flip-Mat\
  \ cost Merisiel? We're still working out pricing for things like Adventure Paths\
  \ and token packs, but we can tell you this: Flip-Mats and Map Packs will be just\
  \ $1.99. And if you already bought the PDF for a Flip-Mat or Map Pack? You can use\
  \ it in Paizo Game Space, free.</p> \n    <p>Gary Teter<br> <i>Senior Software Developer</i>\

  \ runelords make great GMs.</p> \n   </div> \n  </blockquote> <!-- tags: Paizo Game\
