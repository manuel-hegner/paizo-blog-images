  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">by Dylan Birtolo</p> \n   <h2>Chapter Four: A Secret Exposed</h2>\
  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Everything\
  \ was black. Awareness crept back into Marra, and with that awareness came pain.\
  \ Even before she dared to open her eyes, she felt it in her ribs every time she\
  \ sucked in air. It took her a few moments before she realized that she could in\
  \ fact breathe, that the pain was not so unbearable that it would kill her. She\
  \ eased her eyes open, trying to make sense of the hazy blobs of color around her.\
  \ It was green and brown with flecks of blue. As her vision cleared, she realized\
  \ she was looking up at the tree cover and the clear sky beyond.</p> \n    <p>Suppressing\
  \ a groan, Marra turned her head to the side, trying to take in her surroundings.\
  \ Her neck twinged at the motion and she winced to keep from crying out. A gasp\
  \ escaped her lips, which only served to remind her of the pain in her ribs. She\
  \ heard a voice as if from far away.</p> \n    <p>\"She's alive. Bring the healer.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Marra wasn't able to keep track of what happened next. Everything\
  \ was a blur of activity and noise around her. At one point she heard someone murmuring\
  \ a prayer, but she couldn't make out any of the words. Two hands applied pressure\
  \ to her ribs, making her hiss. Heat spread out from those hands, a warming and\
  \ soothing radiance that nudged the pain away. After a few seconds, it no longer\
  \ hurt to take a breath. Marra breathed in deeply, relishing in the simple fact\
  \ that she could to do so. She opened her eyes just as the healer walked away to\
  \ tend to others.</p> \n    <p>Once she was able to prop herself up and slide against\
  \ a tree for support, Marra took stock of the situation. Their small band looked\
  \ to be bruised and beaten, but relatively unscathed. One of the wagons had lost\
  \ a wheel, and a few horses had been killed in the battle, but all of the knights\
  \ and their retinue survived. A few were injured, but Marra seemed to have suffered\
  \ the worst of the injuries. She saw her armor lying in the dirt beside her, the\
  \ breastplate cracked from the impact of the blow. She still wore her chainmail,\
  \ but her arm armor and pauldrons had been stripped from her and now rested in a\
  \ careless heap.</p> \n    <p>As the group finished recovering from the attack,\
  \ Adarrius walked over and stood at Marra's feet, looking down at her. The hairs\
  \ on the back of her neck stood on end and she wanted to squirm, but she managed\
  \ to raise her chin to look him in the eyes. She needed to play the part and be\
  \ strong.</p> \n    <p>\"Sir?\" she asked.</p> \n    <p>\"Where did you learn to\
  \ fight?\"</p> \n    <p>\"From my father.\" </p> \n    <p>At least that statement\
  \ was true. She hoped that it would match with her story. Did the knights of Lastwall\
  \ have an academy? For once she wished she had paid more attention to international\
  \ politics and other forms of government.</p> \n    <p>\"Sir Tarl thought that was\
  \ sufficient to have you knighted and serve under him?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Yes, sir.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"He presented you with armor and sword based on your prowess with\
  \ a blade and courage in battle?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Yes, sir.\"</p> \n    <p>Where\
  \ were these questions coming from? Marra pushed herself up off the ground and stood\
  \ before her superior officer. Her ribs no longer hurt and she felt recovered from\
  \ the injuryâ€”fit enough to charge into battle right then if need be.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Then can you explain to me why you're wearing his armor?\"</p> \n    <p>Adarrius\
  \ kicked at the breastplate so that it rolled over. The only thing that seemed out\
  \ of place was the crack, running across from the left side before it splintered\
  \ into two branches, one going toward the head and the other dropping toward the\
  \ waist. She didn't know what he meant to indicate, so she tried to keep calm and\
  \ not respond to the accusation.</p> \n    <p>When she didn't speak, he continued.\
  \ \"I thought it was suspicious when you had the same etchings on your leather,\
  \ but didn't think too much of it since you're from the same house. But now this.\
  \ Did you know that Sir Tarl was gravely injured fighting orcs about a week ago,\
  \ and it dented his armor in this exact same pattern? We repaired it of course,\
  \ but the steel was weaker where it bent. Don't you find it suspicious that your\
  \ armor just happened to break in the same way?\"</p> \n    <p>The color left Marra's\
  \ cheeks and she felt a chill that had nothing to do with the temperature in the\
  \ air. It felt like winter had grasped her heart and spread snow through her veins.\
  \ She opened her mouth to say something, but no words came out.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Enough. We'll deal with your treachery when we reach Tamran.\"</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n     <br> The leader of the outlaws fights with a skill beyond\
  \ that of a simple bandit.\n    </div> \n    <p>Adarrius grabbed her by the wrist\
  \ and jerked her forward so hard she stumbled to keep from falling on her face.\
  \ She didn't even bother to resist. What would be the point and what could she possibly\
  \ say? This was the risk she had known she was taking and her ruse had been called\
  \ out. Adarrius shoved her into the back of the rear wagon, then bound her wrists\
  \ together and tied them to the bench. Her discarded armor and sword were put into\
  \ the wagon across from her, laid down with much more care than she had been given.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>With a lurch, the wagon started moving again. Marra's mind whirled as\
  \ they journeyed along and the wagon lurched over every bump in the road. What could\
  \ she do? Perhaps she could appeal to Palrion and see if he'd be willing to help\
  \ her escape, but that seemed unlikely. Their alliance had been one of convenience.\
  \ Now that she was a criminal destined for the gallows, why should he side with\
  \ her? It would be simple enough for him to distance himself and she wasn't about\
  \ to try to threaten him. Besides, who would believe a criminal over a trusted squire?</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Marra lost track of time as they journeyed along. Every creak of the\
  \ wagon or clop of the horse sounded like one step closer to her death. So it was\
  \ that when the wagon pulled to a sudden stop, it barely registered. It took the\
  \ shouts and wordless screams of an enraged charge to pull her back to the present\
  \ and jerk her head up.</p> \n    <p>A whistling sound filled the air followed by\
  \ several arrows striking into wood, tearing through fabric, and slamming into bodies\
  \ both horse and human. She heard Adarrius trying to shout commands over the chaos,\
  \ but the general noise of pitched battle overpowered everything else. Marra stood\
  \ up and twisted around to peer through one of the tears in the wagon covering.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Molthuni! It was the Molthuni masquerading as bandits! They probably\
  \ thought a caravan this protected would be carrying something worthwhile. Rage\
  \ filled Marra as she recognized one of the same men who rode into her village months\
  \ ago. She jerked at the rope holding her wrists, but it was bound too tight and\
  \ bit into her skin. She jerked again, planting her foot against the bench and trying\
  \ to pull free with sheer force. The bonds continued to hold.</p> \n    <p>Movement\
  \ at the back of the wagon caught her eye. Several of the squires rounded the corner\
  \ and ducked down near the opening, using the wagon as cover. She recognized Palrion\
  \ in the group and caught his attention.</p> \n    <p>\"Palrion, cut me free. I\
  \ have to fight the Molthuni!\"</p> \n    <p>\"Don't do it! She's an imposter!\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"She wants to run off with the bandits.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Maybe she's\
  \ a bandit! A spy!\"</p> \n    <p>Marra ignored the comments of the other squires\
  \ and kept her gaze locked on Palrion's, imploring him with every fiber of her being\
  \ to trust her in this. She needed to help. The Molthuni could not be allowed to\
  \ escape. He had to believe her.</p> \n    <p>With a sigh, Palrion shoved the other\
  \ squires away long enough to draw the knife from his belt and slide it between\
  \ her wrists. The rope snapped as soon as he was halfway through the first strand.\
  \ She thanked him with a nod, grabbing the sword from the wagon bed and jumping\
  \ out the back over the stunned squires. As soon as her feet hit the ground she\
  \ turned to her left, looking at the battle in front of her.</p> \n    <p>It was\
  \ pitched and the knights appeared to be losing. They were well trained and better\
  \ armored, but the Molthuni had the advantage of numbers and were fighting in formations\
  \ that showed they were far from simple bandits. So far, no one had noticed her\
  \ at the back of the wagon.</p> \n    <p>As she was debating the best course of\
  \ action, Marra caught another flash of the man who had attacked her village. He\
  \ was at the rear of one of the formations, his back facing her. She only caught\
  \ a glimpse of his face in profile, but it was a face burned into memory. Marra\
  \ charged, gripping the blade in both hands.</p> \n    <p>When she was a few strides\
  \ away, she let loose a battle cry and raised the sword high over her shoulder.\
  \ The man turned around just in time to see the blade drop in a deadly arc before\
  \ it cut through the side of his neck. He collapsed, surprise still on his face.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The man's death caused the two warriors in front of him to turn, opening\
  \ them up to attacks from the knights they were facing. They didn't last long against\
  \ the combined force of the knights' assault and Marra's fury. Soon she found herself\
  \ standing next to the knights in the middle of three corpses.</p> \n    <p>But\
  \ there was no time for questions or commendations. Marra turned away from the knights\
  \ to face her next opponent. A Molthuni woman chopped at her with an axe, aiming\
  \ for her skull. Marra sidestepped out of harm's way. Before the Molthuni could\
  \ lift her weapon, Marra grabbed the woman's arm. Marra used the momentum of her\
  \ spin to drive the pommel of her sword into the woman's mouth. The force of the\
  \ blow lifted the Molthuni off the ground. She fell hard on her back, and lay still.\
  \ Marra moved on without giving her victim a second glance.</p> \n    <p>Just under\
  \ the tree line, past the fighting, Marra saw a man dressed in leather and thick\
  \ animal hides watching the battle. His hand rested on the handle of a large axe\
  \ with the tip embedded in the dirt next to him. He watched the scene unfolding\
  \ before him with a critical eye. As his gaze swept around to Marra, his lip curled\
  \ in a snarl and he barked out a command that she couldn't hear. Several of the\
  \ Molthuni in the back responded by turning from their adversaries and circling\
  \ around to face her.</p> \n    <p>Three of them advanced on her, and Marra hesitated,\
  \ the odds bringing a bit of reason back to her senses. She stumbled aside as someone\
  \ shoved her out of the way. It was Adarrius. She didn't realize he was one of the\
  \ knights she had helped.</p> \n    <p>\"Get to the leader! We'll handle these bandits.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Marra rushed forward, dodging around the Molthuni. They tried to intercept\
  \ her, but Adarrius and his companion fell on them and forced them to engage. Marra\
  \ found herself alone, cut off from her allies as she charged toward the Molthuni\
  \ commander. He widened his stance and hefted the axe into both hands, setting himself\
  \ for her charge.</p> \n    <p>As she got within range, he stepped forward, sweeping\
  \ the axe before him in a large arc. Marra stepped back, managing to get out of\
  \ the way before the axe head cut into her midsection. There was no way her chainmail\
  \ would protect her from such a blow. She tried to advance behind the back of the\
  \ axe when the leader was exposed, but he swung the weapon around his head and brought\
  \ it down almost on top of her before she managed to attack him. She sprang to the\
  \ side, lifting her sword above her in both hands to try to ward the blow to her\
  \ right.</p> \n    <p>The axe struck the sword with a clash she felt in her arms\
  \ even more than heard. It took all her strength not to let go of the weapon as\
  \ it vibrated. The axe struck the ground with a shower of dirt. With a grunt, the\
  \ leader flexed his shoulder and tore the axe free, swinging it up at Marra's face.\
  \ She threw her shoulders back, toppling to the ground as the weapon cut through\
  \ the air inches from her cheek. </p> \n    <p>The leader wasted no time, stepping\
  \ forward as he tried to stomp on Marra's sword arm. She rolled away, flicking the\
  \ blade up and slicing it across his thigh. She felt the weapon cut through his\
  \ leggings and was rewarded with a howl as he staggered forward, giving her time\
  \ to rise to her feet.</p> \n    <p>When she turned to face him, he was already\
  \ sweeping the axe down at her shoulder. She ducked under it, instinct forcing her\
  \ to bring up the sword to deflect the axe even a slight degree. This time when\
  \ the weapons struck, there was a high-pitched snap and the tip of her sword flew\
  \ through the air. She glanced at the piece left in her hand, shocked that the steel\
  \ betrayed her. The leader pressed his advantage, driving the butt of his weapon\
  \ into her midsection.</p> \n    <p>She bent over from the force of the blow and\
  \ reached out to steady herself, her hand falling on his shoulder. He snarled and\
  \ shrugged her off. He slammed the butt into her gut again, this time with more\
  \ force. Marra brought her right hand up, driving the broken sword deep into his\
  \ side, sliding it through the armor and between his ribs. His eyes went wide and\
  \ he looked down at her as the axe fell from his fingers. He pushed her away, and\
  \ she stumbled back, letting go of the hilt. The Molthuni leader looked at the weapon\
  \ in his side, clutched it with both hands, and then collapsed to the ground.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>For several seconds, Marra stood over the body, her lungs heaving for\
  \ air. Exhausted, she collapsed to her knees, the thrill of battle unable to carry\
  \ her any further. She heard the fighting die down behind her, but didn't have the\
  \ energy to see which side had been victorious. Slow footsteps came up behind her\
  \ and a light hand rested on her shoulder. Twisting back, she saw Adarrius.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Well done. You fought with valor and honor. I don't know if we would\
  \ have survived without your aid. But there is still the matter of impersonating\
  \ a knight. That is a crime that I'm not able to pardon.\"</p> \n    <p>Marra nodded,\
  \ unable to speak. She was not ready to be bound again in the wagon, but had no\
  \ energy to resist. She felt the pressure of his sword resting against her shoulder.\
  \ It was an odd sensation. The blade rested close enough to her bare neck that she\
  \ could feel both the cold of the steel and the heat of the fresh blood. Her skin\
  \ prickled.</p> \n    <p>\"Rise, Dame Marra.\"</p> \n    <p>There were no words\
  \ to express what she was feeling. She tried to think of something to say, but nothing\
  \ seemed good enough. Instead, she chose to rise to her feet, her face reddening\
  \ when she realized her knees were shaking. Adarrius reached out a hand to help\
  \ steady her.</p> \n    <p>\"Now, let us see to our wounded and then you can tell\
  \ me what would inspire someone to take the risk of impersonating a knight.\"</p>\
