  \  </div> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">The earth shook.\
  \ To Iphra, the rumbling sounded like a passing heavy transport. She realized she\
  \ wouldn’t maintain her footing. Iphra fired her jump jets. Being in the air stabilized\
  \ her enough to avoid a nasty fall from the ridgetop she had been standing on.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The tremor passed.</p> \n     <p>“Sergeant Udrinnel, report. End.” It\
  \ was Lieutenant Markalane from the shuttle a couple miles away, her voice calm\
  \ but insistent.</p> \n     <p>“I’m fine. That was a good one, eh, lieutenant? End,”\
  \ said Iphra.</p> \n     <p>“Affirmative, sergeant. Our engineer clocked it at a\
  \ solid six on the imperial scale. Deploy your final booster and return to the shuttle.\
  \ Aftershocks are anticipated. End.”</p> \n     <p>“Acknowledged. End,” said Iphra.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Her mind wandered. She ignored Markalane checking in with other scouts.\
  \ Iphra thought of the engineer, Winya, a gosclaw. Long, supple, feline—a real pro.\
  \ Winya’s briefing had warned of quakes on Grodrum, but this one was the first the\
  \ survey team had experienced.</p> \n     <p>Iphra looked for the safest way to\
  \ descend the ridge, glancing at the map on her visor’s head-up display. Her final\
  \ deployment marker lay half a mile away in a valley to the east. The landscape\
  \ was barren, but it wasn’t boring. Minerals and crystals on Grodrum—the reason\
  \ the survey team came here—gave the planet a multihued aspect that could be breathtaking.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Equally stunning was the Locus, an eerie, starlike body that illuminated\
  \ this system. The briefing had said it was magical, not a “real” star, whatever\
  \ that meant. Iphra turned to face it. The Locus hung low in the sky, shedding its\
  \ white light through the thin atmosphere. Grodrum’s long day was dwindling.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Iphra began her descent, using her jump jets to avoid treacherous gaps.\
  \ About halfway down, the ground shuddered again. A crashing sound to Iphra’s right\
  \ sent her heart into her throat and activated her instincts. She fired her jump\
  \ jets and leapt. Part of the ridge slid away under her, and she descended onto\
  \ moving rock. Iphra fired her jump jets again.</p> \n     <p>“Come on! Come on!\
  \ Come on!”</p> \n     <p>The second leap threw her clear of the slide zone. Iphra\
  \ took cover on the downhill side of a solid-looking outcropping and crouched, leaning\
  \ against the rock. She closed her eyes and caught her breath. Then, as she opened\
  \ her eyes again, she spotted it: a jagged, beautiful pinnacle of white crystal\
  \ jutted from the valley below. It hadn’t been there before. Iphra looked at her\
  \ deployment marker and saw that the crystal wasn’t too far from it. A little north.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“Sergeant Udrinnel?! Please respond! End!”</p> \n     <p>Iphra realized\
  \ she must have missed a communication from the lieutenant.</p> \n     <p>“Udrinnel\
  \ here. Uh, I’m good. A little landslide, but we’re good. Uh… and lieutenant, a\
  \ mass of crystal erupted from the planet’s surface near my deployment marker. Sending\
  \ you a visual. Any change in my orders? End.”</p> \n     <p>“Stand by. But keep\
  \ safe, sergeant. End.”</p> \n     <p>Iphra descended toward the deployment marker\
  \ as she waited. When she reached level ground, she turned and looked back up the\
  \ ridge, standing in the shadow of the hills. The landslide had revealed a fissure\
  \ in the rock, or the quake had cracked the slope.</p> \n     <p>“Sergeant, proceed\
  \ as planned. I’ve been advised the booster you’re deploying will still allow us\
  \ a detailed scan of that crystal from our location. The concern is the area near\
  \ the crystal might be unstable. Get it done and return to the shuttle. Let’s call\
  \ it a day. End.”</p> \n     <p>“Aye, lieutenant. End,” said Iphra.</p> \n     <p>Disappointment\
  \ rose. It would’ve been nice to see that crystal up close. To touch it. That sort\
  \ of thing makes being a scout one of the best jobs in the imperial military. But\
  \ orders were orders. Besides, Iphra supposed she might have another chance, after\
  \ scans verified the area’s stability and geological content. She turned, stood,\
  \ and gazed. The crystal’s tip glistened in the waning light of the Locus.</p> \n\
  \     <p>“Contact, contact!” The voice of Sergeant Enosh, another scout, erupted\
  \ over the comm. Assault rifle bursts were audible in the background.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>Iphra recalled the mission brief. Orbital probes had shown Grodrum bore only\
  \ simple surface life. Nothing should be here to shoot at. Still, Iphra unslung\
  \ her rifle as Lieutenant Markalane’s voice broke in over the comm again.</p> \n\
  \     <p>Iphra heard only the start of that exchange. In her peripheral vision,\
  \ something massive, amorphous, and multilimbed emerged from the shadow on the rocky\
  \ slope to her left. It struck Iphra three times before she could react. She fell.\
  \ The impact knocked the wind out of her. Pain along her flank suggested broken\
  \ ribs. Environmental force fields kicked on, patching cracks in the armor on her\
  \ left arm and side.</p> \n     <p>The creature loomed over her, blocking the sky.\
  \ It slid its malleable arms around her. Numerous orbs that glowed with white light\
  \ focused on her, burning with malevolence. Were they eyes? Was this thing sapient?</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The thoughts came unbidden. Iphra raised her rifle, levering it into\
  \ automatic mode by muscle memory more than intent. She pressed the trigger. Horrid\
  \ shrieking drowned out the rifle’s reports.</p> \n     <p>The monster recoiled.\
  \ Unhindered even if it was injured, it lifted Iphra with it and squeezed. Sergeant\
  \ Iphra Udrinnel’s vision went white with searing pain, then collapsed to black.</p>\
  \ \n     <center>\n      <hr width=\"50%\">\n     </center> \n     <p>“Look alive,\
  \ squad! The L.T. will be here shortly.” </p>\n     <p>Markalane heard the baritone\
  \ bark as she rounded the corner into the palace’s parade yard. She folded her hands\
  \ behind her. Pausing, she took in the troopers before her. The dominus, her lord,\
  \ had assigned her soldiers, the expendable kind, for the next stage of her assignment.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>She frowned.</p> \n     <p>In the yard, tromlins formed two neat lines.\
  \ Bloodseekers, theropadal bipeds, stood alongside quadrupedal ceratopsid hardshells.\
  \ These dinosaur-like people formed the rank and file of the dominus’s Alien Cohort.\
  \ A barrel-shaped figure in light military plate, the rank of sergeant marked on\
  \ his gorget, paced before them. The sergeant’s head, pale-furred and ursine, looked\
  \ too small in the armor.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"\

  \ clear=\"all\"> \n     <br> \n     <p>Markalane recognized this gathol—Sergeant\
  \ Narg. Underneath the armor, she knew, Narg’s body was massive, covered in the\
  \ same pale fur and several stonelike plates. His people were among the few in the\
  \ Cohort tough enough and willing to keep fractious tromlins in line.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>Turning to continue inspecting the squad, Narg spotted Markalane. He paused.\
  \ Then, in the same sharp baritone, he said, “Officer on the field! Attention!”\
  </p> \n     <p>Every soldier snapped into a formal stance. Markalane strode around\
  \ the squad in silence, glaring at each soldier in turn. None moved. None dared\
  \ return her gaze.</p> \n     <p>“We’ve been assigned a special mission,” she finally\
  \ said. “We’re taking a mining team to a new system to recover a unique mineral.\
  \ You are to keep order during this operation. Good Azlanti scouts died to make\
  \ this mission possible, troopers. Honor them, me, and yourselves by performing\
  \ your duties well. I expect no less.”</p> \n     <p>“Yes, lieutenant!” replied\
  \ every tromlin in unison.</p> \n     <p>“Sergeant Narg.”</p> \n     <p>“Aye, Lieutenant\
  \ Markalane?”</p> \n     <p>“The selected troopers must be ready to fly by oh seven\
  \ hundred. Mining droids, security equipment, and remaining gear must be secured\
  \ aboard the shuttle and ready for inspection then as well. That’s on you, this\
  \ squad, and the other field sergeants. Got it?”</p> \n     <p>“Understood, lieutenant.”\
  </p> \n     <p>“Good. Get it done.”</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p style=\"font-weight:\
