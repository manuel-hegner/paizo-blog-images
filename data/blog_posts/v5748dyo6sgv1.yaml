  \ \n     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">August is upon us, and\
  \ as summer winds down, a fresh batch of Starfinder Society scenarios are on the\
  \ horizon. This month has a lovely pair of scenarios that showcase two very different\
  \ tales and sides of the Starfinder Society. Let’s jump in!</p> \n      <p><a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/products/btq0205s?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-205-Meeting-of-Queens\"\
  >Starfinder Society Scenario #2-05: Meeting of Queens</a> was written by Kiel Howell\
  \ and brings us back to the Pact World of Castrovel. This time, we’re going to explore\
  \ a continent that the Society has yet to really explore: the Colonies, home of\
  \ the ant-like formians. The formians only recently ceased their war with another\
  \ of Castrovel’s prominent species, the lashuntas. Long ago, the formians warred\
  \ against themselves, and a great gathering known as the Meeting of Queens paved\
  \ the way for the formians to come together as a unified people. This month’s scenario\
  \ has the PCs join a recreation of this historic event, joining with the first ever\
  \ lashunta-delegation allowed to participate. Readers may remember Kiel from his\
  \ work on <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01wkn\">Starfinder Society Scenario\
  \ #1-30: Survivor’s Salvation</a> and should look forward to another scenario filled\
  \ with excellent NPC interactions and unique challenges.</p> \n      <div class=\"\

  \ 13px;\">Illustration by Brian Syme</p> \n      </div> \n      <p>Our second August\
  \ scenario comes from Pathfinder and Starfinder Society veteran, Mike Kimmel. I\
  \ knew I wanted to get Mike onboard with our first two-part scenario, and he really\
  \ knocked it out of the park with <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq0205t?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-206-The-Stumbling-Society-Part-1-Sangoros-Lament\"\
  >Starfinder Society Scenario #2-06: The Stumbling Society, Part 1: Sangoro’s Lament</a>.\
  \ OK, so there’s a lot to parse from that long title. First, it’s a two-parter,\
  \ and while it and next month’s follow-up, Starfinder Society Scenario #2-08: The\
  \ Stumbling Society, Part 2: Sangoro’s Gifts, don’t need to be played one after\
  \ another, we would highly recommend groups do their best to arrange the two scenarios\
  \ in order. Secondly, this scenario references a major figure from the Society’\
  s past: Sangoro, the vesk responsible for creating the Exo-Guardians faction. Sufficed\
  \ to say, there’s some lore delving that’s going to happen about the Exo-Guardians\
  \ former base of operations, lost around the time of the Scoured Stars incident.\
  \ Finally, this scenario really kicks off some of the overarching year storyline\
  \ that we’re telling, so I highly recommend that players (both new and veteran)\
  \ slot this on their schedules as soon as they can!</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ \n      </div> \n      <p>That’s it for this month. Come back on September 18th,\
  \ when we provide some previews of our next batch of scenarios. We’ve already given\
  \ a bit of a preview for one scenario, which is <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sguj?Choosing-the-Future-Path\"\
  >something set to change the face of the Starfinder Society worldwide campaign</a>!\
  \ Be sure to stop by and check our preview blog for that scenario, and the sequel\
  \ to this month’s two-parter opening. Otherwise, next week brings another guest\
  \ blog, regarding Pathfinder Adventure Card Society, and some discussion of where\
  \ we are at with Pathfinder Society (2nd edition) launch.</p> \n      <p>For those\
  \ of you wondering where this month’s Pathfinder Society scenario previews are...\
  \ well, <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgso?Pathfinder-Societys-Gen-Con-2019-Scenarios\"\
