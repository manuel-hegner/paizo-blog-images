  \ of news to get to this month, so jumping right in.</p> \n      <h2>Team News</h2>\
  \ \n      <p>As announced on Saturday night at Gen Con, the organized play team\
  \ underwent some changes in personnel. After eight years on the team, lead developer\
  \ John Compton is moving to the Starfinder team as a Senior Developer. With heartfelt\
  \ thanks for all the energy and effort expended on org play, we wish him the best\
  \ in his new role at Paizo. As he departs, we experience a smooth transition, as\
  \ developer Linda Zayas-Palmer steps into the organized play lead developer role.\
  \ She brings six years of org play experience, as well as several more as a volunteer\
  \ coordinator for Pathfinder Society, to the role and we are excited to see her\
  \ influence on our storylines and scenarios. Both Michael Sayre and Thurston Hillman\
  \ remain part of the organized play team. In the next few weeks, we will be working\
  \ with Pathfinder Society managing developer Adam Daigle to evaluate further team\
  \ needs.</p> \n      <h2>Organized Play Foundation News</h2> \n      <p>A few pieces\
  \ of business as it relates to our relationship with the Organized Play Foundation\
  \ (OPF) and volunteers.</p> \n      <p>First, we’ve moved the Pathfinder Society\
  \ (2nd edition) Guide to Play to the Organized Play Foundation website. The direct\
  \ link is <a href=\"http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/paizo/guides/\">http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/paizo/guides/</a>.\
  \ At present, it is online only, but we are working on a version that is print to\
  \ pdf. The surveys we did last fall indicated much of the playerbase wanted an online\
  \ version. Being online also makes it a living document that we can update as needed,\
  \ instead of once a year.</p> \n      <p>Which brings us to the second point. We\
  \ have three OPF volunteers tackling special projects. I’d like to take a moment\
  \ to introduce them to you and welcome them to their new positions.</p> \n     \
  \ <p><b>Jared Thaler</b> – responsible for the OPF website and online guide. He\
  \ is currently working on improving the guide for use at games and will be rolling\
  \ it out shortly. The version on the website now is a temporary version to get the\
  \ rules to the communities running Pathfinder (2nd edition). He will update the\
  \ version # and date on the front page when changes are made, so check there first!</p>\
  \ \n      <p><b>Barb Wilkins</b> – responsible for volunteer onboarding. She is\
  \ working on reviewing current volunteer rosters and sending out new NDAs for signing.\
  \ If you’ve been waiting for your appointment, there should be an end in sight.</p>\
  \ \n      <p><b>Bob Jonquet</b> – responsible for Event Team coordination for Paizo-sponsored\
  \ conventions (PAX Unplugged, PaizoCon, UK Games Expo, Origins, and Gen Con). He\
  \ will work with the organizing committees of those events to ensure a consistent,\
  \ positive experience for all volunteers and attendees.</p> \n      <p>Thank you\
  \ to all three of them for stepping in and filling some gaps in our organizational\
  \ structure. We hope that having some focused attention on these areas will resolve\
  \ some of the issues over the past year.</p> \n      <h2>Redistricting the Regions\
  \ </h2> \n      <p>With the launch of Pathfinder Society (2nd edition) we moved\
  \ some regions around and appointed several new Regional Venture Coordinators. Check\
  \ out the new list here: <a href=\"http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/encyclopedia/volunteer-coordinators/\"\
  >http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/encyclopedia/volunteer-coordinators/</a></p>\
  \ \n      <h2>Campaign Coins</h2> \n      <p>Gen Con gave us the opportunity to\
  \ recognize several longstanding volunteers with Campaign Coins. While each recipient\
  \ had individual qualifications for receiving the award, they all shared a love\
  \ of their communities and a willingness to serve. I hope we created some stardust\
  \ moments for these individuals. They all seemed shocked at the recognition and\
  \ I caught a few of them still in the middle of their volunteer efforts in the Sagamore.\
  \ </p> \n      <p>Please take a moment to thank the following community members\
  \ for their efforts on behalf of our gaming community and congratulate them on receiving\
  \ new Org Play numbers!</p> \n      <table width=\"500\" align=\"center\"> \n  \

  \ <p>Gen Con rang to the sound of games being played and a few 5-star and 5-nova\
  \ evaluations as well. Over the past month, several GMs reached the summit of 5-star\
  \ mountain. To achieve this milestone, GMs run 150 games, of which at least 50 must\
  \ be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios, as well as run a game for a venture-captain.\
  \ A conservative estimate of time needed to reach 5-stars is 650 hours! To the GMs\
  \ listed below, thank you very much for the time and energy you spend running Pathfinder\
  \ Society games! Three cheers on your achievement!</p> \n      <p>Andrew Harasty<br>\
  \ Joe Bouchard<br> Matt Duval<br> Phil Lucas<br> Ivis Flanagan<br> Sean Duncan<br>\
  \ Johanathan Kopp<br> Mark Taylor<br> Sam Pitcheralle<br> Matt Wrycraft </p> \n\
  \      <p>As we pivot on the release of Pathfinder Society (2nd edition), Pathfinder,\
  \ we would like to reiterate that this is not the end of the road for the Society\
  \ (1st edition) campaign. Just as scenarios still count for event support and players\
  \ can still earn boons at events, games ran will still count towards star requirements.\
  \ So, don't worry if you're not quite to your goals, there will still be time to\
  \ reach for the stars.</p> \n      <h2>Novas &amp; Glyphs</h2> \n      <p>Several\
  \ GMs completed 5-nova evaluations over the past month. The rubric is working as\
  \ intended. It looks like we will have the tech updates in the next few weeks, so\
  \ evaluators will be able to input the results. Until then, please email them to\
  \ me at <a href=\"mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com\">organizedplay@paizo.com</a> for\
  \ compilation.</p> \n      <h2>Convention Listing</h2> \n      <p>We have organized\
  \ play activities at quite a few conventions in the upcoming months, so if you want\
  \ to get your game on, check out the list below! The list includes all the event\
  \ support requests received to date. If you see one missing, ping the organizer\
  \ and have them submit a request for support or have them email me at <a href=\"\
  mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com\">organizedplay@paizo.com</a> to discuss their event.\
  \ All of the conventions on the list maintain some type of web presence, be it website,\
  \ social media page, or Warhorn listing, so if you are interested in attending in\
  \ either capacity, check out their websites or contact the local venture-officer\
  \ for more information!</p> \n      <table width=\"800\" align=\"center\"> \n  \
