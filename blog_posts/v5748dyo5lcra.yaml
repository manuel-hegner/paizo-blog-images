  \ Illustration by Scott Purdy\n   </div> \n   <p>Today is the final day of the <a\
  \ href=\"/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8ld1\"><i>Advanced Race Guide</i></a> playtest.\
  \ If you havenâ€™t posted your comments on the playtest document, get them on the\
  \ <a href=\"/paizo/messageboards/paizoPublishing/pathfinder/pathfinderRPG/advancedRaceGuidePlaytest\"\
  >playtest messageboard</a> today.</p> \n   <p>I want to thank everyone who participated\
  \ in the playtest and commented on the first iteration of the race builder. Your\
  \ feedback is going to help us improve the system so that we can make a truly excellent\
  \ tool for GMs to build races for any Pathfinder game.</p> \n   <p>So what did we\
  \ learn from the playtest? A lot of things! Here are some of the highlights.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>First off, as we suspected, some of our initial pricing was off. While\
  \ costing all of the core races at 10 points in the system helped us create a rough\
  \ baseline for standard races, it also created some problems with individual racial\
  \ ability and trait costing. Some abilities were too cheap and others were too expensive.\
  \ Those abilities are being reexamined and the values will be more balanced and\
  \ intuitive in the final race builder.</p> \n   <p>Second, we learned that we needed\
  \ to open up some of the prerequisites and expand the options presented the final\
  \ race builder. Many people pointed out that the Tiny size option being limited\
  \ to the fey type was far too restrictive. A number of playtesters had some really\
  \ interesting ideas that required Tiny creatures of types other than fey. My personal\
  \ favorite was the idea that many of you had to create a race of toy solider constructs.\
  \ On a related note, we learned that may of you were very eager to make dragon-type\
  \ races, not just dragon-themed races using the humanoid or monstrous human type.\
  \ You can expect to see the ability to create dragon-type races in the final document.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Some of the best feedback from the playtest came in the form of the actual\
  \ races that the participants built and the suggestions of racial abilities that\
  \ folks came up with. Reading through those fun and exciting race builds, comments\
  \ on those builds from other playtesters, and the very long wish list of racial\
  \ abilities that people wanted to see gave us lot of ideas for expanding the system.\
  \ We are looking forward to seeing any additions you post today.</p> \n   <p>Stephen\
