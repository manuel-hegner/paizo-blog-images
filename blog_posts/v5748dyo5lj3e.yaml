  \ set of <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder Battles</a> prepainted plastic\
  \ miniatures! And thanks to one friendly Dragon Con panel attendee, I've decided\
  \ to add a FOURTH figure to this evening's preview, in part to make up for the last\
  \ couple of weeks with no updates and in part to show her that dreams really do\
  \ come true, sometimes much more rapidly than you can imagine!</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  \    </div> \n    <p>Let's start things off today with this imposing Dwarf Slaver,\
  \ as nasty a ginger as your player characters will ever encounter. With art based\
  \ on the Chelish villain Kossrani from <a href=\"/products/btpy9g0q\"><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Adventure Path #97: In Hell's Bright Shadow</em></a>, this guy has enough personality\
  \ to be a hero OR a villain. He's also a good illustration of how things can go\
  \ wrong during the sculpting and approval process, and how good WizKids is at fixing\
  \ our mistakes! Take a close look at Kossrani's shield, with the awesome carved-in\
  \ symbol of Asmodeus. Well, it would have been awesome if it hadn't been sculpted\
  \ in reverse. You see, sometimes when we're laying out books, we flip an image on\
  \ its Y axis to make for a more interesting page layout. This usually works with\
  \ no problems, but occasionally, as in the case of <em>Pathfinder #97</em>, something\
  \ like a holy symbol gets reversed and causes a bit of a problem. In this case,\
  \ I didn't notice until the paint master came into the Paizo offices and I was holding\
  \ it in my hand. Happily, WizKids was able to fill in the mold for the cut-out part\
  \ of the shield, and will instead be producing the (correct) Asmodeus symbol using\
  \ a tampo stamp. All praise be to the Lord of the Nine Hells! Miracles really do\
  \ happen, you guys! The Dwarf Slaver is a Medium figure slated at the uncommon rarity.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160908-TorrentKnight.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160908-TorrentKnight_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Up next is the Torrent Hellknight, based on the Wayne\
  \ Reynolds character design for the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/hellsRebels\"\
  >Hell's Rebels</a> character Lictor Octavio Sabinus from the cover of <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9gcx\"><em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #98</em></a>. This is our third\
  \ or fourth Hellknight in <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder Battles</a>\
  \ so far (I've lost count!), and he's definitely one of my favorites. I think I've\
  \ found that, as cool as all-black armor looks on the printed page, it sometimes\
  \ results in fairly underwhelming prepainted figures, at least color-wise. Thankfully,\
  \ the blue cape and silver scale armor in Wayne's design gives us some interesting\
  \ colors to pop with this guy, and I think he'll be a popular choice for player\
  \ characters and NPCs alike. Heck, get a couple of them and they serve as pretty\
  \ killer elite guards for any of the various Chelaxian (or even just generally evil)\
  \ NPCs we've released to date. The Torrent Hellknight is a Medium, uncommon figure.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160908-JilliaBanilus.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160908-JilliaBanilus_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Speaking of despicable Chelaxian villains, here we have\
  \ Jilia Bainilus, the former mayor of the city of Kintargo and a very interesting\
  \ character in the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/hellsRebels\">Hell's Rebels\
  \ Adventure Path</a>. Calling Jilia a villain is a bit of a stretch (as well as\
  \ a bit of a spoiler), so in the interests of not ruining anything let's just say\
  \ her Facebook alignment status is \"It's Complicated.\" Jilia's look comes direct\
  \ from the brush of Pathfinder superstar artist Wayne Reynolds and the cover of\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9grk\"><em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #99</em></a>. I think\
  \ she's got a fantastic look for a player character noble swordswoman. Although\
  \ Jilia's official game statistics are... let's just say, \"somewhat different,\"\
  \ to me this is pretty much the perfect swashbuckler miniature, and I can't wait\
  \ to use it in my games. Jilia Bainilus is a Medium, rare figure.</p> \n    <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160908-StrixSorcerer.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160908-StrixSorcerer_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>After one of my fun Dragon Con panels this last weekend,\
  \ a dedicated Pathfinder fan came up to ask me if we might ever do a Pathfinder\
  \ Battles figure of a Strix, the dark-skinned primitive winged folk who feature\
  \ so heavily in the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/hellsRebels\">Hell's Rebels\
  \ Adventure Path</a>, Liane Merciel's wonderful <a href=\"\"><em>Nightglass</em></a>\
  \ novel, and elsewhere. I was pleased to not only say \"yes, we will!\" but to say\
  \ \"yes, we will, as soon as humanly possible. In fact, we've got one in the very\
  \ next set!\" So here you go, Pathfinder fan. Your very own Strix Sorcerer, suitable\
  \ for use as a player character or a nasty winged villain. Huzzah! The Strix Sorcerer\
  \ is a Medium, uncommon figure.</p> \n    <p>Next week, I'll be back with more awesome\
  \ previews for <a href=\"/products/btpy9kcu\"><em>Deadly Foes</em></a>. A formal\
  \ announcement of the next set should hit soon. In the meantime, I'm currently working\
  \ on the NEXT setlist with our recently returned Director of Licensing, Mike Kenway.\
  \ We're starting with a blank slate and a VERY loose theme for this one, so please\
  \ let me know if you have any requests! I'm particularly interested to hear what\
  \ major races or groups you'd like to see us cover with multiple \"like\" figures\
  \ in the same set. By my count we've done goblins, orcs, hobgoblins, bugbears, ghouls,\
  \ and a few others.</p> \n    <p>What else do you want or need? Let us know in the\
  \ comments.</p> \n    <p>Until then, I remain...</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p>\
