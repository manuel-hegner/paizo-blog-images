  \ On the Role of Industry Leader</h2>\n             <p class=\"date\">Thursday,\
  \ November 29, 2012</p>\n             <p class=\"tiny\" align=\"center\"><em>This\
  \ blog entry is the tenth in a series of blogs commemorating Paizo's 10th anniversary.<br><a\
  \ href=\"/paizo/blog/2012/february/v5748dyo5ld43\">Click here to read the first\
  \ installment</a>.</em></p>\n             <p><span itemprop=\"description\">As I\
  \ mentioned in my previous blog, Paizo found itself in a very interesting position\
  \ as we came to the end of 2010. Never before in the history of tabletop RPGs was\
  \ there a market leader that wasn't Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Why is that important?\
  \ Well, there are certain tasks that the tabletop RPG industry has always relegated\
  \ to the top dog in the category—and chief amongst those was player acquisition.</span></p>\n\
  \             <p>Common wisdom in the industry was that only the market leader had\
  \ the ability to bring significant numbers of new people into the tabletop RPG hobby.\
  \ One major reason for this is an idea called network externalities. When the telephone\
  \ was invented, its usefulness was limited until other people installed telephones;\
  \ as the telephone network expanded, having a phone became more and more useful.\
  \ The same thing goes for interstate highways, DVD players, and Facebook. And when\
  \ products reliant on network externalities compete with one another, the one that\
  \ wins is usually the one with the bigger network.</p>\n             <p>It may not\
  \ be immediately obvious that RPGs rely on network externalities, but they do. Let's\
  \ say there's a new RPG that you're really keen on trying. You can't play it yourself,\
  \ so you need to find three or four other people who want to play that RPG. Chances\
  \ are good that if you get a group of four or five people together and compare notes\
  \ about what game they all know how to play, the answer is most likely to be the\
  \ market leader. Which, for the entire history of RPGs, had been D&amp;D. I remember\
  \ when I first started working on Ars Magica back in 1987—I would have Storyguides\
  \ (the Ars Magica equivalent of GMs) sending me letters lamenting the fact that\
  \ they couldn't find a group because everybody was playing D&amp;D. Matter of fact,\
  \ another piece of the industry's common wisdom was that, in the odd cases that\
  \ an RPG other than D&amp;D brought you into the industry, you'd still eventually\
  \ end up playing D&amp;D because it was the one game that almost everybody knows\
  \ how to play.</p>\n             <p>Network externalities also meant that only D&amp;D\
  \ had the name recognition and placement in stores to be able to attract significant\
  \ numbers of new gamers into the fold. Even as D&amp;D cycled through multiple editions,\
  \ essentially creating a new branch of their network each time a new edition was\
  \ released, the fact that TSR or Wizards focused on products for the current edition\
  \ meant that players were incentivized to stay on the newest branch; they didn't\
  \ have to compete with themselves. But then the OGL came along, and so did 4th Edition.</p>\n\
  \             <p>The fact that Pathfinder is built on the 3.5 SRD means that if\
  \ you've played D&amp;D, you can quickly become familiar with Pathfinder. 4E, on\
  \ the other hand, was different enough from what had come before that it created\
  \ a new branch of the network, and for the first time, gamers could choose to follow\
  \ D&amp;D to the new branch or stay on the old branch with Pathfinder. And at the\
  \ end of the day, Pathfinder ended up being the one with the bigger network.</p>\n\
  \             <p>Before 2011, we never really had the reach through hobby game stores,\
  \ book stores and organized play to be the game that people start gravitating to.\
  \ Then, seemingly suddenly, big book stores were putting together islands of Pathfinder\
  \ products. They were facing our books cover out on the shelves. They were talking\
  \ to us about running games in their stores. And most of all, they were asking us\
  \ for an introductory game that they could sell to folks who never played Pathfinder\
  \ or D&amp;D at all.</p>\n             <p>We had always dreamed about creating an\
  \ introductory boxed set for Pathfinder. Paizo staffers each had their own story\
  \ about buying one of the intro sets for D&amp;D back in the late '70s or early\
  \ '80s; the wonder of learning a new game that would become such a big part of our\
  \ lives was something indelibly etched into our minds. But with those memories came\
  \ expectations about how awesome our own version would need to be. And until 2011,\
  \ Paizo didn't really have the clout or the reach to make our expectations a reality.</p>\n\
  \             <p>Boxed sets are complicated and expensive to manufacture. Most book\
  \ printers don't make dice. Most dicemakers don't make boxes. And most boxmakers\
  \ don't print books. So you usually need to deal with multiple vendors to coordinate\
  \ delivery and assembly. And a lot of hands involved means a lot of cost. But an\
  \ introductory box can't have a high price tag, so you need to work with pretty\
  \ low margins. And that means that you need to make a LOT of them to make any money\
  \ on them. And when you make a lot, you need to be able to sell a lot. Frankly,\
  \ every time we'd looked into the logistics and finances of making a box set, it\
  \ had scared the crap out of us. But now, we thought we <em>could</em> sell a lot.\
  \ We had the opportunity to make the intro set we had always dreamed about.</p>\n\
  \             <p>To start the process, we had a meeting where I brought in every\
  \ single D&amp;D intro set TSR and Wizards had ever made. We opened up the boxes,\
  \ rummaged through the components, scoured through the books, and made lists of\
  \ things that we liked and didn't like about each set. One thing we noticed was\
  \ that the earlier sets—the ones that had hooked us in our younger years—did a much\
  \ better job of providing you with a simplified game system that you could actually\
  \ run campaigns from. They provided young GMs with the tools to understand how to\
  \ run a long-term D&amp;D game. As the years unfolded, it seemed that the D&amp;D\
  \ intro sets moved away from that and became more and more a programmed intro that\
  \ was meant to be played and discarded as the new gamer moved onward to the core\
  \ rulebooks. While we needed new players to eventually graduate to the core Pathfinder\
  \ rulebooks, we also wanted our own intro set to provide more of the tools we remembered\
  \ from the intro sets we grew up with.</p>\n             <div class=\"blurb180\"\

  \     <br>\n               The white board becomes the design medium of choice for\

  \      <br>\n               Paizo staff members try to puzzle out character creation\
  \ during an in-house playtest while Sean K Reynolds watches.\n             </div>\n\
  \             <p>One of the things we knew we needed to work hard on was accessibility.\
  \ When we looked at the <em>Pathfinder Core Rulebook</em>, we saw a reference book\
  \ that was great for finding rules when you already knew how to play, but was not\
  \ very friendly when you were a beginner attempting to navigate the sometimes arcane\
  \ rules of our game system. We decided to approach our own intro set, which we had\
  \ decided to call the <a href=\"/beginnerbox\"><em>Pathfinder Beginner Box</em></a>,\
  \ from a graphic design and layout point of view first instead of the normal process\
  \ of providing our art team with finished text which they then laid out. Sarah Robinson,\
  \ Paizo's Art Director, has a background in creating strategy guides for video games,\
  \ and we thought we could learn a thing or two from their approach on teaching.</p>\n\
  \             <p>The process became a very collaborative (if time intensive) one.\
  \ The design team would tell the art team what content they wanted to have in the\
  \ book. Then the art team would create a graphic layout that they felt would be\
  \ the most accessible, and they'd give that back to the design team. Then the design\
  \ team would have to rewrite the content to fit the graphic design, sometimes needing\
  \ the graphic design to change in order to present the rules better. This happened\
  \ back and forth numerous times, each time with the product getting better and more\
  \ clear.</p>\n             <p>Once we were done, we needed to do some testing to\
  \ see if our theories would stand up to the test of actual use. Our first test was\
  \ having some folks who were rather new to RPGs inside Paizo test out the character\
  \ creation system to see how intuitive it was. When only one of the four testees\
  \ was able to finish character creation without some help, it became apparent that\
  \ there were problems. But it gave us some ideas, so we went through another couple\
  \ of rounds of design and graphic design until we had a new iteration that we thought\
  \ might work better.</p>\n             <p>The next test was to bring in friends\
  \ and family of Paizo employees to create characters and run a short adventure under\
  \ our watchful eyes. This test went much better, but there were still a few sticking\
  \ points. After a few more cycles of tinkering, we faced the closed door playtest.\
  \ In this test, an outside company that specializes in product testing recruited\
  \ groups of people who didn't know how to play RPGs but, based on their other hobbies,\
  \ might have an interest. These testers were given a prototype <em>Beginner Box</em>,\
  \ and we were allowed to watch their progress through a one-way mirror. We would\
  \ not be allowed to give them any help, thus simulating the experience a customer\
  \ would have once they brought our product home. We took a lot of notes.</p>\n \
  \            <p>The experience was both stimulating and humbling. Some things that\
  \ we thought were downright obvious weren't, while other innovations we had come\
  \ up with in our iterative process proved to work very well. The best part of these\
  \ tests was the disappointment on the gamers' faces when the testing came to an\
  \ end and they had to stop playing the game. They were really having a good time\
  \ and were genuinely bummed that they had to stop. That was a very good thing.</p>\n\
  \             <p>While design and art were working back and forth on the books,\
  \ Jeff Alvarez took on the task of getting the <em>Beginner Box</em> manufactured.\
  \ In addition to the box, books, character sheets, and dice, we had decided to include\
  \ cardboard pawns similar to the ones we'd made for our Kill Doctor Lucky board\
  \ game (which meant we also needed plastic bases for those pawns) as well as a Flip-Mat\
  \ printed with an introductory dungeon on one side and a plain grid (for long-term\
  \ play) on the other. Jeff's office became overrun with printer samples from all\
  \ over the world as we tried to find the best prices and highest quality. Eventually,\
  \ we found a place in China that could handle most of the components (and pack in\
  \ the few things that needed to be made elsewhere), and we were off to the races.\
  \ We wanted the <em>Beginner Box</em> out for the holidays—which meant it needed\
  \ to be in stores at the end of October—and the deadline to finish up the product\
  \ was tight. Many late nights and weekends were sacrificed, but we were able to\
  \ get the product shipped to the printer on time.</p>\n             <p>When the\
  \ <em>Pathfinder Beginner Box</em> came out in October 2011, we had unprecedented\
  \ buy-in from the retail community. From Barnes &amp; Noble to your friendly local\
  \ game store, Beginner Boxes flew off the shelves that holiday season. Among the\
  \ most rewarding things that have come out of the release of the <em>Beginner Box</em>\
  \ are the stories we've heard from gamers who used it to introduce their children\
  \ to the game, or first-time gamers who saw the product at their local store and\
  \ are now gamers for life. We are very proud of the product we ended up producing,\
  \ and of the group effort that allowed it to take form.</p>\n             <p>The\
  \ core rules line in 2011 took a slightly different take with our first two rulebooks.\
  \ With the release of the <em>Advanced Player's Guide</em> in 2010, we had added\
  \ a number of new classes to the game. After a lot of discussion, we had decided\
  \ that we wanted to get all of the major fantasy classes out early in Pathfinder's\
  \ life cycle, so our 2011 books were strongly class-oriented. Thematically, we divided\
  \ the two releases up into one book that focused on magical classes and one that\
  \ focused on combat classes. Four new core classes were created: the magus, samurai,\
  \ ninja and gunslinger, along with a wealth of archetypes that covered the fantasy\
  \ gamut.</p>\n             <p>The rest of the schedule for Pathfinder pretty much\
  \ followed our standard path. The <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/carrionCrown\"\
  >Carrion Crown Adventure Path</a> for the first half of the year allowed Managing\
  \ Editor Wes Schneider to delve deeply into the haunted hillsides of Ustalav. Later\
  \ in the year, James Jacobs finally got his chance to explore a new continent in\
  \ Golarion with the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/jadeRegent\">Jade Regent\
  \ Adventure Path</a>, which took characters from familiar Varisia over the polar\
  \ ice cap into Minkai.</p>\n             <p>The Pathfinder Society organized play\
  \ program took an even bigger part in our marketing efforts starting in 2011. In\
  \ previous years, Pathfinder Society was always part of one person's larger job,\
  \ but we were never in a position where we could afford to have a single person\
  \ focus on this vital part of our plan. In August, at Gen Con, we interviewed a\
  \ number of candidates, focusing our efforts on people who had been in the trenches\
  \ of Pathfinder Society on a local basis. After numerous interviews, we settled\

  \               Will Chase surveys the first shipment of Pathfinder Battles: Heroes\
  \ &amp; Monsters miniatures from WizKids.\n             </div>\n             <p>In\
  \ our minds, one thing that a world-class RPG publisher should provide for its players\
  \ is prepainted plastic miniatures. D&amp;D Miniatures had been a huge seller in\
  \ the paizo.com online store, so as Pathfinder grew, we constantly talked about\
  \ the possibility of doing plastic minis. The problem stems from the fact that it\
  \ is exceedingly hard to do well and profitably. Paizo's competencies lie more along\
  \ the paper printing line, so we were stymied in our efforts. Then, one day in early\
  \ 2011, Justin Ziran from WizKids emailed me asking if we might be interested in\
  \ working with them to create a line of Pathfinder preplastic minis. Maybe I came\
  \ across as <em>too</em> excited, because it took us months and a lot of information\
  \ exchange before we managed to go forward with one single product: <a href=\"/products/btpy8l52\"\
  >Beginner Box Heroes</a>, a four-pack of miniatures depicting the iconics used in\
  \ the <em>Beginner Box</em>.</p>\n             <p>When WizKids announced the 4-pack\
  \ to their retailers, the size of the orders caused them to fast-track a 40-mini\
  \ set dubbed <a href=\"/products/btpy8mq6\">Heroes &amp; Monsters</a>. We were hoping\
  \ to have it come out at the end of 2011, but in the end, only Beginner Box Heroes\
  \ made it out by year end. But the groundwork for a long and fruitful partnership\
  \ had been made.</p>\n             <p>Early 2011 also brought a most unexpected\
  \ opportunity. In January, I was browsing Facebook when I noticed my friend Ryan\
  \ Dancey had left CCP, where he had been working on a massively multiplayer online\
  \ RPG (abbreviated to MMORPG or simply MMO) called EVE Online. I sent him a message\
  \ that ended with, \"So what are you going to do now?\" His response was not what\
  \ I expected: \"Have you ever thought about doing a Pathfinder MMO?\"</p>\n    \
  \         <p>I actually had thought about what a Pathfinder video game might look\
  \ like, but I'd always figured that someone like Electronic Arts or BioWare would\
  \ eventually come along and ask for a license to make such a game. But what Ryan\
  \ was suggesting was starting a new company to make the Pathfinder MMO ourselves.\
  \ I was scared and intrigued all at the same time. So I asked Ryan to come up with\
  \ a plan and pitch it to me.</p>\n             <p>A month later, Ryan came to Seattle\
  \ with his plan, and he won me over. The fear subsided and the excitement kicked\
  \ in, because Ryan wasn't asking for the usual huge bankroll that many MMOs have\
  \ blown through trying to take a crack at supplanting World of Warcraft as the market\
  \ leader. No, he was being much craftier. He wanted to put together a tight team\
  \ to build the Pathfinder MMO for a small, organically growing audience. No need\
  \ for the enormous marketing budget that would attract millions of customers at\
  \ launch, or the even bigger development budget used to generate tons of content\
  \ for all those players to burn through; he was looking to launch for just a few\
  \ thousand customers. Ryan was also talking about a making a sandbox MMO—a game\
  \ where the story is controlled by the players and set in a digital world that they\
  \ can help to build... or seek to destroy. It was a plan that learned from the failures\
  \ of past MMOs and blazed new trails for the future. It was a plan I could get behind.</p>\n\

  \         <p>But one doesn't decide to do something as epic as an MMO without a\
  \ lot of planning and a fair bit of money. Over the next several months, Ryan worked\
  \ on a business plan and a design document for the MMO, now called Pathfinder Online.\
  \ We wrestled back and forth over the numbers—I needed this project to be as lean\
  \ as possible, and I trimmed out all the fat I could find. In the end, we had a\
  \ compelling game that would cost little enough that I felt it would be feasible\
  \ to find funding.</p>\n             <p>In November, we announced <a href=\"http://goblinworks.com\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Goblinworks, Inc.</a> and Pathfinder Online to the world. Why\
  \ would we announce it so early considering the game wasn't even funded at the time\
  \ or even a certainty? I have always run Paizo in a very transparent manner. I knew\
  \ that as we went out to look for funding for our new company, word would get out\
  \ about what we were doing. I never want a Paizo customer to have to try to piece\
  \ together news about our company from whispers and half-truths—I would rather put\
  \ the news out there so our customers know what's going on directly from our mouths.</p>\n\
  \             <p>After we announced the company, we launched a series of <a href=\"\
  http://goblinworks.com/blog\" target=\"_blank\">bi-weekly design blogs</a> on goblinworks.com,\
  \ where we've been sharing our vision for Pathfinder Online, and we've been interacting\
  \ with the growing <a href=\"/paizo/messageboards/paizoPublishing/licensees/pathfinderOnline\"\
  >Pathfinder Online community on the paizo.com messageboards</a>. Our plan has always\
  \ been to work closely with our customers to make Pathfinder Online, much like we\
  \ have with the Pathfinder RPG. Thousands of brains and years of experience will\
  \ lead to a much better game than a handful of folks, no matter how talented, working\
  \ in a vacuum.</p>\n             <p>At the ENnie Awards in August, Paizo won 9 golds.\

  \             <p>One specter that raised its head in 2011 was the rumor of a fifth\
  \ edition of Dungeons &amp; Dragons. In the spring we started to hear rumblings\
  \ which surprised us quite a bit. Wizards had just launched their \"red box\" starter\
  \ product the previous year, and we thought 4th Edition was just starting to get\
  \ into its groove. The idea that they were seriously considering or even working\
  \ on a fifth edition was a move we didn't see coming. Just before Gen Con, we heard\
  \ that they would be announcing the new game at the show. Of course, this made a\
  \ lot of sense; they'd announced previous editions at the show that was built by\
  \ the success of D&amp;D. However, at the show, the buzz went around that something\
  \ happened and the rumored announcement was cancelled at the last minute.</p>\n\
  \             <p>Of course, the idea of a fifth edition had our heads swirling at\
  \ Paizo. It made some sense since sales of Pathfinder had surpassed that of D&amp;D,\
  \ but it also seemed much earlier than we had expected. What should Paizo do? How\
  \ should we respond? Since we didn't know anything about their plans, we decided\
  \ that our best course of action was to just stay the course, put out the best products\
  \ we could, and see what WotC had up their sleeve. In December, we found out that\
  \ the fifth edition announcement had been rescheduled for the beginning of January.</p>\n\
  \             <p>As the year ended, Pathfinder was getting stronger and stronger.\
  \ Sales of the Pathfinder Core Rulebook had been growing each year since its release.\
  \ The number of people playing in the Pathfinder Society program were also jumping\
  \ up year after year. All signs were looking up as we headed into our tenth anniversary\
  \ year in 2012, but the impending 5E announcement was waiting for us in the new\
  \ year.</p>\n             <p><b>Employees who started in 2011 (in order of hiring\

  \           <br>\n               Mike Brock joins Paizo as our Pathfinder Society\
  \ Campaign Coordinator.\n             </div>\n             <p>Wow! I've already\
  \ passed my one year anniversary at Paizo. That was fast—and the best year I have\
  \ had on any job. As I mentioned when I came on board as the Organized Play Coordinator\
  \ in my first blog, I am privileged and honored at the trust Paizo has given me\
  \ to oversee Organized Play in general, and Pathfinder Society specifically.</p>\n\
  \             <p>I first met some of the current Paizo staff in the late '80s and\
  \ early '90s. I played at Living City tables with Jason Bulmahn's character, Thalkin\
  \ Talymir, human fighter of Torm, and Erik Mona's character, Ellund Torvin, another\
  \ human fighter. I still have a letter dated October 1997 from Lisa Stevens, then\
  \ Vice President of the TSR Brand Team, advising that she was helping to get the\
  \ RPGA up and running again. It's kind of neat to look back and see that I have\
  \ come full circle and actually get to work with these awesome folks who have been\
  \ a part of my hobby for more than 15 years.</p>\n             <p>Like many of you,\
  \ I started as a fan of Paizo with the magazines. I remember renewing my <em>Dragon</em>\
  \ and <em>Dungeon</em> Magazine subscriptions only to be advised a month later that\
  \ they were going away. Enjoying the Adventure Path installments in the later <em>Dungeon</em>\
  \ Magazines, I of course opted into the Pathfinder Adventure Paths, becoming a charter\
  \ subscriber. Shortly after receiving my first AP volume, and experiencing Paizo's\
  \ awesome customer service (though I <em>still</em> haven't gotten any of Liz's\
  \ cookies), I became a charter <em>super</em>scriber. I was hooked.</p>\n      \
  \       <p>A year or so later, my home group was in its fourth year of a Forgotten\
  \ Realms campaign when Wizards of the Coast announced 4th Edition. I gave my group\
  \ the Pathfinder Beta rulebook and some of the other books I had added to my collection,\
  \ and they voted to play Pathfinder instead of 4th Edition. Like many of you, while\
  \ we awaited the finished RPG, I continued running Adventure Paths using the 3.5\
  \ rules for my home group (Legacy of Fire is still my favorite), while dabbling\
  \ in Pathfinder Society occasionally when someone would miss a game.</p>\n     \
  \        <p>Fast forward to Gen Con 2011. Shortly before the convention, the Pathfinder\
  \ Society Campaign Coordinator position became available. I remember joking with\
  \ my home players that if they didn't shape up their tricked-out characters in our\
  \ Legacy of Fire game, I would apply for the job at Paizo. They surprised me by\
  \ encouraging me to go for it. I emailed Erik and told him I was interested in the\
  \ job but I didn't think it would go any further than that. Several weeks later,\
  \ I was at Gen Con GMing 10 slots. I was surprised yet again when Mark Moreland\
  \ came up to me and advised that Erik wanted to chat about the job with me. When\
  \ Mark told me the meeting with Erik was going to be at White Castle, I thought\
  \ it was a big joke my friends from Georgia had set up. Had I known that White Castle\
  \ meant serious business to Erik, I would probably have been a little nervous. But\
  \ Paizo bought my meal (if you can call it that), and I got to sit and chat with\
  \ several employees over \"wonderful\" cheeseburgers, and then I went back to GMing,\
  \ thinking that was the end of that.</p>\n             <p>Several weeks later, I\
  \ received a call from Erik asking if I would like the job. Many would think I would\
  \ have accepted it straight away. There was one problem, however: I had not told\
  \ my wife, Mrs. PFS, that I was seriously pursuing it. I had to find a way to convince\
  \ her that a move from Georgia to Seattle, uprooting our family, was a good thing.\
  \ I eventually found a few ideas to bribe her with, and lucky for me, she accepted\
  \ the position for both of us.</p>\n             <p>I've been here for several months\
  \ past a year now and it doesn't seem like it. Time has flown, and Pathfinder Society\
  \ is growing by leaps and bounds. The growth surpassed my 12-month goals, and I\
  \ look forward to seeing how far it surpasses my 18- and 24-month goals. Even after\
  \ a year, I am still honored and privileged to come into my office, with maps of\
  \ Golarion and all the Pathfinder books I could ever want, sitting in front of me.\
  \ And I love the tons of emails I receive about how Pathfinder Society has positively\
  \ influenced people's lives. Much like my last job, making a difference in people's\
  \ lives matters to me, and I am glad I am able to provide that in this line of work\
  \ as well.</p>\n             <p>Thanks, Purple Golem!</p>\n             <p>Mike\

  \ one last picture on his last day as an intern.\n             </div>\n        \
  \     <p>It probably sounds cheesy, but that's probably because it is: ever since\
  \ I was a kid, I'd always dreamed of writing these kinds of books. But I won't bore\
  \ you with such a familiar tale; many of you doubtlessly already know that story.\
  \ Let's skip to the middle, instead.</p>\n             <p>While studying at Western\
  \ Washington University, I was originally on track to get my B.A. in a branch of\
  \ journalism called Visual Journalism. I had always sort of figured that RPG writing,\
  \ and by extension all of fantasy writing, was little more than a pipe dream for\
  \ me; after all, I'd talked to countless talented GMs and players like me who would\
  \ have loved nothing more than to work for a tabletop RPG company, and they'd never\
  \ so much as scratched the surface of this occult industry, so what chance did I\
  \ have? I imagined that a degree in journalism would be more marketable than one\
  \ in English (I know, I know... I was young) even though I wasn't as passionate\
  \ about it, but I checked the job listings on the Paizo website every week anyway,\
  \ just to see if there'd be an internship open anywhere near me. At the very least,\
  \ I thought, I could get to see what working at my dream job was like, if only for\
  \ a few months.</p>\n             <p>I didn't have to wait long; by spring quarter\
  \ of my junior year, there was an opening for the Editorial Intern position, and\
  \ I leaped at the chance. When I actually landed the internship, I was ecstatic.\
  \ I drove down from Bellingham to Redmond (a 100-mile journey each way) three days\
  \ a week for over two months, and I couldn't have been happier. I switched my academic\
  \ path to Creative Writing as soon as I got the gig and realized that perhaps my\
  \ childhood dreams could indeed become manifest, and I even scored a not-inconsiderable\
  \ amount of freelance throughout the year after my internship. I applied for the\
  \ Developer position shortly after my graduation ceremony. Getting the job was far\
  \ from a sure bet, in my mind—I worried incessantly about it, both before my interview\
  \ and afterward. I remember having nightmares of getting hired, not getting hired,\
  \ what I'd do if I didn't get hired, that kind of thing. But, well, I probably don't\
  \ need to tell you I was eventually offered the position. Wes called me in late\
  \ July while I was hiking around the Grand Canyon, and I said I could start Tuesday.</p>\n\
  \             <p>I've learned a lot since I began working full-time at Paizo almost\
  \ a year and a half ago. Socrates is quoted as saying that \"the only true wisdom\
  \ is knowing you know nothing,\" and while I would hardly consider myself truly\
  \ wise in any sense, my first few months here served as a valuable lesson in teaching\
  \ me just how much nothing one can know. Pathfinder is huge, and while I thought\
  \ I knew the rules and world pretty well when I hired on, I was quickly proven wrong.\
  \ Very, very wrong. It hadn't really occurred to me until I started working here\
  \ full-time just how expansive Pathfinder was—Golarion, the history of the industry,\
  \ the complexity of a large-scale publishing operation, the passion of the fans\
  \ and employees. It all took me very much by surprise, and during those first months\
  \ (when I was thrown headfirst into development with products like the Jade Regent\
  \ Player's Guide and Book of the Damned III), I often wondered, \"Is this what drowning\
  \ is like?\" Yet, with drowning, there is undoubtedly fear. Anyone who's ever swam\
  \ in the ocean before knows the immensity and unbridled power of water, the strength\
  \ and inherent danger of crashing waves. Paizo strikes a similarly awesome, similarly\
  \ daunting figure, but I wouldn't say I was scared when I first started working\
  \ here. I may have been scared or intimidated leading up to it, but once I was in\
  \ the thick of the work and immersed in the culture, entrenched alongside the amazing\
  \ people who worked at Paizo and the fantastic fans of our products, I wasn't scared—\
  I was invigorated.</p>\n             <p>I've felt the same exhilarating sensation\
  \ ever since, though the thought of drowning has since ebbed from my conscious mind\
  \ considerably, now little more than a distant rumble of the waves that reaches\
  \ my ears only when we're buried in the latest hardcover. Every day at Paizo, I\
  \ get to relive the half-remembered dream-moments of my youth, when I'd spent innumerable\
  \ hours crafting larger-than-life characters and building fantastic worlds for no\
  \ one but myself. Only now, I get to work alongside dozens of brilliant and wonderful\
  \ people, and the fruits of our labors are enjoyed by thousands of other gamers\
  \ all around the world. Paizo even pays me to do the work I'd happily do for free\
  \ (but don't tell my bosses that; seriously, don't—I've got bills to pay), and that's\
  \ pretty nice too.</p>\n             <p>Patrick Renie<br><em>Developer</em></p>\n\
  \             <h2>The Little Robot that Could</h2>\n             <p>Overall, my\
  \ experience with roleplaying games and Pathfinder in particular was relatively\
  \ novice when I applied at Paizo. I had been playing in a Kingmaker game for a little\
  \ over a year at that point, and while I was confident in my ability to fill the\
  \ job requirements (my previous occupation was in pre-production for a printing\
  \ and manufacturing plant), I couldn't help but wonder if I should have done more\
  \ research on wizards and combat maneuvers. It took a few months to hear back, and\
  \ right when I'd assumed that they'd probably found someone else, I got an email\
  \ from Gary asking about a phone interview. I was elated and somewhat shocked, but\
  \ two interviews later, found myself trying to figure out how to transplant my life\
  \ to Washington.</p>\n             <p>My first week at Paizo was crazy. I'd left\
  \ my previous job on a Friday, traveled with my husband, pets, and belongings over\
  \ 700 miles on Saturday, unpacked on Sunday, and was at Paizo that Monday, and somehow\
  \ had overlooked that PaizoCon would be happening at the end of that week. I struggled\
  \ a bit at the convention, getting fellow employees names and faces switched up\
  \ (sorry, Sutter and Wes!), and truthfully not really knowing what people actually\
  \ did at PaizoCon (was it games? dice? booths? meet and greets? prawns?). In retrospect,\
  \ this was probably the best week to start at Paizo. There were no training wheels.\
  \ I found myself tasked with a fairly sizable amount of projects and a long to-do\
  \ list, but was ready to tackle it all.</p>\n             <p>My role as Digital\
  \ Products Assistant is somewhat split between multiple kinds of work (part website\
  \ tasks, part digital product delivery, part design, and part customer service)\
  \ which took some time to adjust to. Prior to the release of the Jade Regent Adventure\
  \ Path, I had been working on a new product feature that we now know as the Interactive\
  \ Map PDFs. This involved bending InDesign to perform tasks that it's not usually\
  \ intended to do, and finding a solution that worked with Paizo's existing workflow.\
  \ We also had the release of the Beginner Box, the redesign of the Pathfinder Reference\
  \ Document, and a myriad of other items that ended up on paizo.com before the end\
  \ of the year. Being a member of the tech team also meant picking up an array of\
  \ technical knowledge and valuable skills from Gary, Lissa, and Ross (and I still\
  \ do).</p>\n             <p>I spent the first six months traveling 2 to 3 hours\
  \ each day to and from the office (sometimes arriving at the unearthly hour of 6\
  \ AM, for which I now can thank my new coffee habit). And not only did a new job\
  \ bring along the array of normal challenges, but relocation had brought it's own\
  \ set of stressors to the table. It didn't really hit home until the Paizo holiday\
  \ party that I had actually accomplished a somewhat monumental task. I'd moved my\
  \ whole life successfully and everything else just seemed to be falling into place.\
  \ And the best part: I'd found a company to work for with people that cared about\
  \ the same things I did, who shared an intense amount of passion for the work they\
  \ did, and who really do value each others opinions. Though I don't do anything\
  \ very publicly remarkable like write rules and adventures, it's exciting to come\
  \ into the office each day. I am grateful for the ability to be myself at Paizo:\
  \ nerdy, somewhat awkward, but proud of it.</p>\n             <p>Chris Lambertz<br><em>Digital\

  \ Reynolds.\n             </div>\n             <p>The first time I heard of Pathfinder\
  \ and Paizo Publishing was winter 2008. I was trying to rework one of my favorite\
  \ homebrew adventure paths for a new group of gamers and had gotten together with\
  \ one of my favorite friends to ping ideas off of. While I was over that night he\
  \ mentioned a new system that a friend had picked up for him at Gen Con that was\
  \ compatible with 3.5. I was a bit skeptical of trying a new system, but when he\
  \ presented me with the system's softcover beta rulebook, I had to admit it had\
  \ my complete attention. I quickly flipped through the amazing illustrations inside\
  \ of the book, went over its designer notes, and promptly asked if I could borrow\
  \ the book for the next few days.</p>\n             <p>From there I went to the\
  \ Paizo website and followed the game from there. I was working a job as a night\
  \ auditor at the time, which left me plenty of time to browse the messageboards\
  \ and take in the clever banter of the Paizo community over the next few years.\
  \ One particular night, a certain thread posted by the company's \"Gninja\" caught\
  \ my attention—she mentioned that Paizo was hiring a new customer service representative.\
  \ I enjoyed my job at the time, but felt like I had been shoehorned into a niche\
  \ that I was unlikely to grow from. I created a resume from scratch that very night,\
  \ attempting to balance professionalism with geekiness to create a suitable blend\
  \ to potentially set myself apart from the other applicants. With a little luck\
  \ (and a cosplay picture) I managed to find myself a short period of time later\
  \ prepping for a phone interview, but with an entertaining twist.</p>\n        \
  \     <p>The key thing about working as a night auditor is that, well, you work\
  \ at night. I had planned on immediately going home and getting a few hours of sleep\
  \ before my phone interview, but when one of my coworkers called in sick that morning,\
  \ I had to cover for them. I found my plans foiled and myself on the phone with\
  \ bloodshot eyes and almost no sleep. Despite everything, I felt that I delivered\
  \ a fairly strong interview. I had answered all of the important questions in a\
  \ decisive manner: My class was a paladin, dexterity was my highest stat, and I\
  \ was genuinely looking forward to using my skills to make Paizo a better place\
  \ for everyone. My greatest flaw was that I couldn't decide if my favorite animal\
  \ was a honey badger or a snow leopard, but I felt I still sounded confident in\
  \ my indecision. Afterward, all I could do was sit back and see if my delivery was\
  \ strong enough.</p>\n             <p>A week later, I came to discover that while\
  \ it had been a very close call, they had opted to go with another applicant. I\
  \ had no regrets; even if I hadn't been their choice, it was still nice knowing\
  \ that I was in genuine consideration for the position. Over the next 6 months,\
  \ I attended PaizoCon and met the Paizo staff in person, which was the first time\
  \ I truly came to regret not having landed the job. After PaizoCon, I started planning\
  \ for my next convention, which was PAX. A few weeks before that show, after fulfilling\
  \ my duties at work, I found myself browsing the Paizo messageboards again. This\
  \ time, I discovered that they needed volunteer GMs for the Pathfinder Society area\
  \ at PAX.</p>\n             <p>I signed up on the messageboards and found myself\
  \ gamemastering at PAX. I had a lot of fun, and while my player survival ratio was\
  \ embarrassingly high compared to the other GMs, the players I was hosting sessions\
  \ for seemed to be enjoying themselves immensely. I left my number with the Paizo\
  \ staff in case they needed an emergency substitute GM, and didn't think twice about\
  \ it, so I didn't expect the phone call I got a few days later. Because I'd made\
  \ a good impression at the convention, and had been a close call for the CS job\
  \ earlier, I suddenly found myself on the other end of another phone interview,\
  \ this time with a much more relaxed tone and—equally wonderful—a full night's rest.\
  \ I put in my one-month notice at work the next day and found myself at Paizo not\
  \ long after. The events that have transpired since then have been truly amazing,\
  \ but I believe I'll leave that story for another day. After all, I haven't even\
  \ started talking about the daily games I run during lunch with the warehouse staff\
  \ yet!</p>\n             <p>Erik Keith<br><em>Customer Service</em></p>\n      \
