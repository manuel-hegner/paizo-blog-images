  >Urwal, the enigmatic leader of the Verdant Wheel faction of the Pathfinder Society,\
  \ took stock of his garden. He decided Skyreach needed a rooftop garden all on his\
  \ own when he’d chided Sorrina Westyr, the Master of Spells, that the building itself\
  \ was lacking in nature’s presence. She’d replied that he should try growing a garden\
  \ on the grounds. Thinking that an excellent solution, he’d secretly transported\
  \ soil, bricks, and fish for fertilizer near to the top of Skyreach, the towering\
  \ headquarters of the Pathfinders in Absalom. Urwal had found a location with just\
  \ enough flat area to create the garden he felt the building needed. He’d also make\
  \ treks to various springs across Kortos, the island on which Absalom was built,\
  \ drawing from different sources (in a pattern only he would understand) to water\
  \ the plant life he nurtured in secret. It took years, but the project was finally\
  \ bearing fruit—literally.</p>\n      <p>He decided that its presence should be\
  \ unknown to the rest of the organization, until the time was right. A garden atop\
  \ the building should have been noteworthy of notice, but it surprised him just\
  \ how rarely people looked up. Likely those who did just assumed it was supposed\
  \ to be there. Though the garden was not a neat and tidy thing and instead resembled\
  \ a sort of wild thicket in the sky, bordered by magically strengthened brickwork\
  \ to keep the soil in. There was, of course, a reason for each plant and a purpose\
  \ for their placement, but Urwal saw no need to share such things. He believed that\
  \ anyone with the talent and patience to study the stars would understand why he\
  \ does whatever he does. Though recent events had left even the pillar of self-assuredness\
  \ that is Urwal incredibly shaken.</p>\n      <br clear=\"all\">\n      <div class=\"\

  \   <p>It was not long ago that an incredible and terrifying sight filled the sky:\
  \ Achaekek slew Gorum, and parts of the now-dead god rained down upon Golarion.\
  \ Urwal had been going more often to this garden after seeing that spectacle and\
  \ hearing reports of its effects across the world. This garden was a place of calm\
  \ for him, where he hoped to find clarity to help guide the Society forward, but\
  \ even that was failing him now. “I should have seen something in the stars.” He\
  \ sighed, expressing his frustration to the immobile plants atop the otherwise empty\
  \ rooftop. He continued quietly to himself, “Omens may be lost, but I’ve seen many\
  \ hints of things to come before. But this Godsrain, I saw no sign of it. Gave no\
  \ preparations. Agents were in danger and I did not prepare them.” He paused, looking\
  \ over his garden. “I must do better.”</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n\

  \      <br>\n      <p>Urwal’s bright yellow scales shone in the afternoon sun as\
  \ he went to water the various plant life he’d nurtured atop the grand spire, finally\
  \ finding some mental peace. He even allowed himself a chuckle as he thought of\
  \ the reaction Ambrus Valsin, the venture-captain in charge of day-to-day operations\
  \ in Skyreach, would have when this garden was revealed. “It’ll need to happen when\
  \ Ambrus is in a good mood. He’ll complain about it, but he’ll come around.” As\
  \ he moved to water a rather healthy raspberry bush, he noticed an unnatural shine\
  \ coming from the berries upon it. It reminded him of the silver that rained from\
  \ the sky the day Gorum fell.</p>\n      <p>“What have we here?” he asked himself\
  \ as he quickly finished watering the remainder of his garden before moving to examine\
  \ the berries more closely. His troubles forgotten, he spent the remaining afternoon\
  \ into the evening studying the altered fruit. Bringing the full suite of his knowledge\
  \ to bear, Urwal was able to determine a few things. First, the berries now held\
  \ divine power within them. He’d heard stories of those who were touched by the\
  \ silver rains gaining power, but it was strange that only the berries seemed affected\
  \ and not any of the other myriad plants he’d raised. “Might be the water choice,”\
  \ he mused as he considered the various springs he’d transport water from. “It’\
  s possible any one of those could be the source,” he thought aloud, recalling the\
  \ complex web of watering choices largely determined by his astrological readings.\
  \ Second, these berries did not ripen further or seem to change at all once removed\
  \ from the bush. “Maybe I didn’t notice the coming of the Godsrain, but it would\
  \ seem I made preparations all the same.”</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ filled with experiments and tests, until Urwal decided that he wasn’t going to\
  \ learn anything significant without some risk. He ate one of the berries. The effect\
  \ was immediate. It wasn’t so much that he grew stronger as it was that he was more\
  \ himself than he’d ever been. The confidence he’d always felt concerning his path\
  \ almost glowed within. “This is… divinity?” An ember of power glowed within him,\
  \ though he could feel that its power was temporary. “Oh my. These, these must be\
  \ kept close and safe. I will find a way to use them. The stars will know. This\
  \ time, I will be better. I will see that they’re prepared for whatever it is that\
  \ would have our agents needing such power.” A grin crossed his lizard-like face.\
  \ “After all. I planted these for a reason. Now I need only find out what that reason\
  \ is.”</p>\n      <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold; line-height:\
