  \ seem like time should fly so fast! Before you know it, PaizoCon 2017 will be upon\
  \ us. This is a big year, as it is the 10th anniversary of PaizoCon. Putting together\
  \ the PFS schedule, along with that at Gen Con, and am extremely enthusiastic about\
  \ what the team has in store for the second part of Season of Plundered Tombs and\
  \ Year of the Stolen Storm.</p> \n    <p>But this week isn't about conventions.\
  \ Well, not ones coming up. Instead, I asked our Venture-Officers in Spain to write\
  \ about their activities for the past year. When I joined the PFS team as OPC, we\
  \ had two Venture-Captains, one in Barcelona and one in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria,\
  \ and three Venture-Lieutenants throughout the country. The current Venture-Captain\
  \ of Madrid, Tesifonte Negro Gonzalez, joined shortly after as one of two Venture-Agents.\
  \ The team in Spain now numbers 4 Venture-Captains (Leon, Barcelona, Madrid, and\
  \ Las Palmas de Gran Canaria), 12 Venture-Lieutenants, and 7 Venture-Agents. They\
  \ went from 2 tables a month to a recent event with 20+ tables of the special <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy9mbe\"><em>#8-00 The Cosmic Captive</em></a>. But enough\
  \ of statistics, time to hear from the Spaniards!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ Higher Numbers</h2> \n     <h3>Madrid</h3> \n     <p>It all started long ago.\
  \ A steady group of GMs leaded by Miguel Madrid, Eric Barroso, Francisco \"Nagash\"\
  , Miguel \"Puck\" and Pedro Moreno gathered every four weeks in order to brighten\
  \ the weekends for our pathfinders.</p> \n     <p>At the beginning, Miguel Madrid\
  \ organized everything: gathered up the GMs, created a blog that everyone can visit,\
  \ talked to different retailers in order to have a place to have fun.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>Many people recognized his hard labor, and decided to join him: first, Eric\
  \ Barroso, who became his second in command and then Tesi Negro (who recently became\
  \ Venture Captain). They decided to increase the numbers by visiting retailers and\
  \ offering initiation games to whoever wanted to come.</p> \n     <p>People flocked\
  \ to them of all ages, young and not so young, students and workers, people who\
  \ were more or less familiar with the system or roleplaying games and wanted to\
  \ explore Golarion for the first time. After seven \"initiations\", the number of\
  \ stable players doubled, and so did the number of GMs.</p> \n     <p>We had to\
  \ seek a bigger place in order to accommodate all the explorers, and we found our\
  \ \"Grand Lodge\" in Goblin Trader Madrid Norte, a retailer that so far has treated\
  \ us like queens and kings.</p> \n     <p>Sometimes, people from smaller lodges\
  \ (León, Miranda, Bizkaia) come to Madrid and join us, or vice versa, which is a\
  \ great success, given the distances.</p> \n     <p>We are now planning to create\
  \ a group in Complutense University, called the 'Rolativity', to spread the words\
  \ and bring us more new blood. We are still figuring out how we will manage, and\
  \ if our captain and officers have really gone mad, but one thing is certain: we\
  \ will keep raising the numbers and having fun, because heterogeneity is one of\
  \ the things that define Spain!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a\

  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <h3>Barcelona</h3> \n     <p>Barcelona has recently held\
  \ the DAU a huge event that involved plenty of resources and energies from Gustavo\
  \ Cruz's crew. León sent its VC, Mario Grande (first right, next picture) and also\
  \ by adding more tables to the event in Barcelona via HANGOUTS. Madrid decided they\
  \ were no less than those northerners and sent their VC too, Tesi Negro (second\
  \ right), in a gathering that would have the three captains (Gus is the man in the\
  \ mid!).</p> \n     <p>All the time and effort were worth it and the DAU were a\
  \ complete success. The event held the multi-table adventure <em>The Cosmic Captive</em>\
  \ during Saturday and several other adventures during Sunday. It was a blast.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>In the upcoming weeks León and Madrid will hold another event, by the\
  \ end of January.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderSociety/20170116-Photo3.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <h3>León</h3> \n     <p>León has also experienced a huge\
  \ rise on numbers: given the fact its population rounds 130k souls, people flock\
  \ to roll dice and live adventures with Mario and his GM's.</p> \n     <p>(Leon\
  \ is so busy, VC Mario didn't have time to send me words to include!</p> \n    \
  \ <p>Tesifonte Negro Gonzalez<br> <i>Venture-Captain, Spain—Madrid</i></p> \n  \
  \  </blockquote> \n    <p>Next week is scenario release, so John will put fingers\
  \ to keys to give everyone a preview of the final part of the Tyranny of Winds trilogy\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9p8z\"><em>#8-12 Tyranny of Winds, Part 3: Caught in the\
  \ Eclipse</em></a> and <a href=\"/products/btpy9qc8\"><em>8-13 What Sleeps in Stone</em></a>.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>I'll be back the end of January with information on volunteering for\
  \ Gen Con 50, coming up in August 2017!</p> \n    <p>Until then—Explore, Report,\
  \ Cooperate!</p> \n    <p>Tonya Woldridge<br> <i>Organized Play Coordinator</i></p>\
