  ><i>Crown of the Kobold King</i></a> we introduce the dwarven deity Droskar, God\
  \ of Toil. Droskar's following began as a reaction against the bon vivant trends\
  \ that pervaded the dwarven society of their day, instating a dreadful dogma of\
  \ salvation through endless toil and brutal subservience to the Dark Smith, as Droskar\
  \ was often called. The dwarves became slaves to their own industry, producing heaps\
  \ of weapons, armor, and gear to appease their dark god. The wilderness around them\
  \ was fed to Droskar's fires of industry, until the dwarves choked on their own\
  \ black fumes and starved in the dust.</p> \n   <p>The rise of this new religion\
  \ also saw the first appearance of a new undead monster associated with such endless\
  \ toil: the forge spurned. When a dwarven worshiper of Droskar perishes, he is brought\
  \ before his divine lord and judged. If the Master of the Dark Furnace finds him\
  \ unworthy, he is pierced with burning barbs and returned to the world as a tormented\
  \ undead creature on an accursed errand to gather souls for Droskar's Furnace. Forge\
  \ spurned are consumed with their need to forge their soul chains, and prey upon\
  \ any creature they feel they can easily best. If a forge spurned is felled and\
  \ its chain taken by another, it seethes with dark fury. A forge spurned stops at\
  \ nothing to retrieve its chain, lest it be forced to forge another, extending its\
  \ period of burning torment.</p> \n  </blockquote> <a href=\"/image/product/secondary/Modules/8-Forge_Spurned.jpg\"\

  \ spurned resemble hulking dwarves wrapped in heavy steel chains. Their faces, hands,\
  \ and bodies are riddled with glowing hot hooks and half-melted razor wire. Black\
  \ smoke rises from their smoldering beards, framing a freakishly contorted face\
  \ covered in ash and soot. The tormented beings heft black iron hammers in both\
  \ hands, and the chains that drape their forms possess the malevolent life of angry\
  \ metal serpents.</p> \n   <p>Jeremy Walker <br>Assistant Editor, GameMastery </p>\
