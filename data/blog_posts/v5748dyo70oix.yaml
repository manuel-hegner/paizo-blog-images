  description\">Order of the Amber Die here, still going strong as the years roll\
  \ on! In case you aren't familiar with our work from past projects, we'll repeat\
  \ the staccato version. We only play published adventures. We use the complete rules\
  \ set. We've had the same GM since our founding: 1987. We like to push the envelope\
  \ of tabletop roleplaying. We only play marathon sessions—days at a time. We play\
  \ on location. Our GM isn't afraid to kill characters or TPK us; he'll do it in\
  \ front of the community, too. Imagine us <a href=\"http://knowdirectionpodcast.com/2019/10/joining-order-of-the-amber-die/\"\
  >like a roleplaying team</a>, complete with a Captain and Ref position to help the\
  \ players. We revere one d20 above all others, and that is the Amber Die. It doesn’\
  t roll more 20s than it should, but it chains them when it does, and doubters have\
  \ always been converted. After more than 170 adventures, we've even gotten rid of\
  \ RPG absolutes: yeah, we'll split the party.</p>\n      <p><b>Past Pathfinder Projects</b></p>\n\

  \  <br>\n      <h2>The Scions</h2>\n      <p>In our previous projects we’ve always\
  \ put our own spin on things. For The Abomination Arsenal, we tried to reach the\
  \ bottom of Pathfinder’s largest megadungeon with a party consisting entirely of\
  \ gunslingers. With The Strange Aeons Experiment, we assembled a team of Pathfinder\
  \ players who knew nothing about Lovecraft or the Elder Mythos, and sent them through\
  \ the Strange Aeons AP to see what would happen. The list goes on, but we’ll let\
  \ you check out each project as you may.</p>\n      <p>The years have gone past\
  \ and we’ve come far enough to be able to look back across the ground we’ve covered.\
  \ We’ve grown older together, added new members, said hard goodbyes, and finally\
  \ stopped to look back at ourselves. This has been a personal journey for us as\
  \ members of Order of the Amber Die, just as much as it has been a journey through\
  \ adventure paths in front of the community.</p>\n      <p>This project won’t just\
  \ be a playthrough of <a href=\"https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/skykingstomb\"\
  >Sky King's Tomb Adventure Path</a> , it will focus on appreciating time and family.\
  \ The Sky Scions is about a dwarven family in-game, and Order of the Amber Die as\
  \ a family ourselves. For this project, Adam has dialed up some of the oldest members\
  \ of the Order. In each marathon you’ll see a cameo from as far back as 1987, when\
  \ three 10-year-olds sat in mom’s basement and dreamed up a club centered around\
  \ their favorite die.</p>\n      <p>We’ve always stuck to the complete rules set,\
  \ never deviating. As the years went by, our inbox filled with messages asking what\
  \ house rules we would employ if we ever chose to. With the release of Pathfinder\
  \ Second Edition and Remaster, we also received requests asking which optional rules\
  \ we would utilize from the GM Core if we ever chose to. The answer was always simple\
  \ and quick, but the Will DC increased with each passing year. Around the fire pit\
  \ at our headquarters, Fort Rannick, we looked at the time visible on each other’\
  s faces and finally decided to go for it.</p>\n      <p>As our house rule for this\
  \ project, age modifiers from Pathfinder 1E will be adapted to Pathfinder 2E. A\
  \ player’s age in real life determines their age category (and thus their adjusted\
  \ attribute modifiers) in-game. We broke down our membership by decade, so the “\
  venerable” age category in-game consists of players that are 50-59 years old out\
  \ of game, as those are our oldest members. 40-49 in real life is considered “old,”\
  \ and 30-39 is marked as “middle-aged” for modifiers. While we acknowledge that\
  \ there are plenty of exceptions to these modifiers in real life, we wanted to create\
  \ something that distinguished us by age at the table. Each marathon will feature\
  \ different rosters of dwarves (therefore ages) from the clan. Still, it’s our first\
  \ house rule across all these years. We must be getting old.</p>\n      <p>As a\
  \ variant rule in addition to our house rule, we will be employing the “free archetype”\
  \ from the GM Core. After reading through the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02ehs?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Highhelm\"\
  >Highhelm hardcover</a>, we were reminded of how faith is one of the fundamentals\
  \ of dwarven culture. We wanted to feel the dwarven pantheon as an ever-present\
  \ part of our story; thus, we all have the same free archetype: Blessed One. We\
  \ purposely spread the deities among the characters, so we’ll have a variety around\
  \ the table at each marathon.</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a\

  ></p>\n      </div>\n      <h2>Meet Clan Firecask</h2>\n      <p>We are all playing\
  \ strong-blooded dwarves of Clan Firecask, a Goldhilt clan from the greatest of\
  \ the dwarven sky citadels: Highhelm. Our main colors are orange and green, and\
  \ amber features in various ways, of course. Our accent color is blue topaz, and\
  \ each of our clan daggers is adorned with the matching stone.</p>\n      <p>We’\
  re not just members of Clan Firecask, we’re directly related to Clanleader Perhill\
  \ Firecask herself. Which in turn means we’re related to one another, of course.\
  \ On your left at the table might be your in-game grandparent, and across from you\
  \ could be your own child or even a sibling. This should make for some interesting\
  \ roleplaying, and we’ll include a section in each blog to let you know how it goes\
  \ along the way. When it’s your great-grandchild who just dropped to dying 2 across\
  \ the battlefield, you might make different decisions than you normally would. As\
  \ for family spats? Expected.</p>\n      <p>While the Ironhilt and Steelhilt clans\
  \ of Highhelm might consider us “soft hands,” our dwarven hands are always busy—\
  busy making beer! This wouldn’t be an Order of the Amber Die project without a high\
  \ level of immersion, but it was a bit tricky trying to figure out how to approach\
  \ this vital piece of Clan Firecask’s identity. We came up with this: what if we\
  \ brewed our own beer out-of-game, and learned the process together as a group the\
  \ same way our dwarves have spent their lives doing? We ran it by one of our friends,\
  \ Brandon Gillam of <a href=\"https://www.runehammer.online/\">Runehammer</a>, since\
  \ he was joining us periodically throughout the adventure path. Brandon offered\
  \ to up things a notch: what if we contacted a brewery and had our own unique beer\
  \ for this project, label and all? This is where <a href=\"https://sacredvice.com/\"\
  >Sacred Vice Brewing</a> in Philadelphia got involved. Brandon drew the label, Sacred\
  \ Vice made the beer, and our GM dropped the release of Clan Firecask’s newest beer—\
  <em>Battle Axe</em>—right into the actual storyline of our campaign!</p>\n     \

  \      <h2>Highlights from Preparing Sky King’s Tomb:</h2>\n      <ul>\n       <li>Knowing\
  \ that Highhelm would feature heavily in our launch marathon, our GM worked closely\
  \ with <a href=\"https://www.blackbardstudios.com/\">Black Bard Studios</a> to make\
  \ sure the city appeared as one of our best setups over the years. We’re excited\
  \ to show you more!</li>\n       <li>Some of our friends from over the years will\
  \ make an appearance. Ready to see Joe O’Brien of the <a href=\"https://www.glasscannonnetwork.com/\"\
  >Glass Cannon Network</a> as a dwarf from Clan Firecask? How about Brandon Gillam\
  \ as Renck, the wise bard and keeper of clan recipes? You might even recognize Brandon’\
  s expert hand as the artist of the portraits in this blog. Stay tuned.</li>\n  \
  \     <li>Elemental Stones is one of the most popular games of Highhelm. Our GM\
  \ has already told us to learn it, as he’s making sure it will feature directly\
  \ in this campaign. You know us by now, so we’ll stop the session and play a real\
  \ game every time it comes up.</li>\n       <li>Another thing we still love about\
  \ being around the table is our props. Dwarven coins from <a href=\"https://www.norsefoundry.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoq0ZsZ7Yxexo4cKzbydAlHKE0dTfn1TTJ5uYO5NbQ0tUmih2H0C\"\
  >Norse Foundry</a>? Pile ‘em up. A dwarven helmet, some quality wooden mugs, and\
  \ custom clan daggers? Yup. Beard extensions for those of us who dare? Let’s go\
  \ for it. Growing your actual beard for a year in advance? Jody did it.</li>\n \
  \      <li>It’s been a while since we played <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderAdventurePath/20171216-Beach.jpg\"\
  >on location</a>, and how awesome would it be to experience the Darklands in an\
  \ actual cave? Pennsylvania has quite a few caves that are managed for tourists,\
  \ so our plan is to find one that will let us spelunk in and set up our Pathfinder\
  \ game!</li>\n      </ul>\n      <br>\n      <h2>What’s Next</h2>\n      <p>We’\
  ll drop a blog for every marathon we play, with a plan to finish this AP in six\
  \ or seven marathons. As Adam likes to remind us, a TPK ends the project. Expect\
  \ to hear from us again soon with part one!</p>\n      <br>\n      <h3><strong>Follow\
