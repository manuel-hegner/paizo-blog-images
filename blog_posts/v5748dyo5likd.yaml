  \ many gamers—International GM's Day and the anniversary of the passing of game\
  \ designer Gary Gygax. I began to reflect on my first games and how much they shaped\
  \ my gaming experience, where I thought about the experiences that encourage players\
  \ to return to the table. I would love to hear of your first encounters with the\
  \ world of gaming and what made them so memorable—leave your stories in the comments!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Of course, we don't need an International GM's Day to say thank you to\
  \ all the GMs out there that spend large amounts of their free time preparing and\
  \ running games for their players! The Pathfinder Society team would especially\
  \ like to recognize those GMs achieving their 5th star over the past six weeks.\
  \ To reach 150 games, a GM dedicates more than 750 hours to their craft, and that's\
  \ just the time it takes to run games. There are many more hours of preparation\
  \ and planning involved. Please join in a big round of applause for our newest 5-star\
  \ GMs!</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>Carlos Danao<br> Kjersten Gibson (Kitty)<br>\

  \    <h2>Pathfinder Society Adventure Card Guild Accessory Contest</h2> \n    <p>Last\
  \ month I hinted at our next Pathfinder Society contest, and this month the focus\
  \ will beon the Adventure Card Guild. This time around, we want to see your table\
  \ accessories that add pizazz or pow to the game. The rules for entry are below:</p>\
  \ \n    <ul>\n     <li>You may only enter once, with one accessory</li> \n     <li>Entries\
  \ must be submitted to <a href=\"mailto:contest@paizo.com?Subject=Pathfinder%20Society%20Adventure%20Card%20Guild%20Accessory%20Contest\"\
  >contest@paizo.com</a></li> \n     <li>Include a photo of your accessory and a description\
  \ of its use (<em>NOTE: Photos may be resized or cropped to better show off the\
  \ mini for voting. We suggest trying to send the biggest possible resolution to\
  \ retain details for resizing. Any image format is acceptable!</em>)</li> \n   \
  \  <li>Include your paizo.com username</li>\n    </ul> \n    <p>Of course, a contest\
  \ means prizes! First place will win $25 paizo.com store credit and three runners\
  \ up will each receive $15 store credit. Entries will be accepted until <b>12:00\
  \ PM Pacific time on March 25, 2016</b>. Voting will open on March 28, 2016 and\
  \ continue until April 8.</p> \n    <h2>Convention Updates</h2> \n    <p>This weekend\
  \ I compiled the list of PaizoCon volunteers, worked on finalizing the schedule,\
  \ and sending responses to volunteer submissions. I have received some withdrawals\
  \ from the Gen Con volunteer pool and will be contacting other GMs to fill those\
  \ positions. If you are waiting to hear on either of those conventions, expect an\
  \ email by the end of the week.</p> \n    <p>Looking forward, I will be traveling\
  \ the rest of the month. First to GAMA Trade Show in Las Vegas, Nevada, where I\
  \ meet with retailers to discuss Pathfinder Society in their stores. Then I am off\
  \ to Florida, where I'll hold a meet &amp; greet in Tampa and spend some vacation\
  \ time with my family. While I'm away, John will be writing the Pathfinder Society\
  \ blogs, so I will wish everyone a fun and happy Pharast and see everyone in Gozran!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Until then—Explore, Report, Cooperate!</p> \n    <p>Tonya Woldridge<br>\
