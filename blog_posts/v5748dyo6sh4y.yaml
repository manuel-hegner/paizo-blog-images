  \ Game takes place in a galaxy that is vast and full of surprises, so it’s no wonder\
  \ that our rulebooks occasionally contain surprises of their own—some of which might\
  \ include unclear meaning, the occasional typo, or the like. At Paizo, we strive\
  \ to provide clear and concise rules content to help you play an exciting and engaging\
  \ game, and part of that is clarifying when things go awry.</p> \n     <p>To that\
  \ end, I’m very excited to announce our new-and-improved <a href=\"https://www.paizo.com/starfinder/faq\"\
  >FAQ and errata page</a>! Special thanks to Rei Ko, Maryssa Mari, and Andrew White\
  \ for building this tool. This new streamlined system will help us efficiently address\
  \ our community’s most pressing questions in a centralized, easily searchable location.</p>\

  \ \n     </div> \n     <p>A handy localized search function helps you find the exact\
  \ answers you need, so go ahead and search for “forced movement,” “solar flare,”\
  \ or even “page 179” to highlight questions and errata containing those terms.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>As you use this resource (which contains our existing FAQ as well as\
  \ some new questions and answers), please also continue to visit Starfinder’s <a\
  \ href=\"https://paizo.com/community/forums/starfinder/rules\">rules questions forum</a>.\
  \ You might find that a helpful community member has already clarified something\
  \ you were wondering about, and you can join others in calling for a question to\
  \ be added to our FAQ.</p> \n     <p>Thanks, and we look forward to answering your\
  \ questions!</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight:\
