  /products/btpy8v0b\">Shattered Star</a> set of Pathfinder Battles prepainted plastic\
  \ figures officially released on Wednesday of this week, and reactions from those\
  \ lucky enough to have received them already have been very positive!</span></p>\
  \ \n    <p>Speaking personally for a moment, I always love that tipping point where\
  \ all of the hard work we've put into a Pathfinder Battles set finally gets shared\
  \ for real with you guys, so that you can see exactly what we've been so excited\
  \ about week after week here at Paizo, as we work with WizKids to make Pathfinder\
  \ Battles the coolest line of prepainted plastic gaming figures available. Hearing\
  \ your comments (and your criticisms, too!) makes us feel like all that hard work\
  \ was really worth it, and the back-and-forth definitely makes each Pathfinder Battles\
  \ release even stronger than its predecessors. I can't thank you enough for the\
  \ interest and support you've shown our line since the very first day we announced\
  \ it.</p> \n    <p>You guys are awesome!</p> \n    <p>Here at Paizo HQ, we've been\
  \ crazy busy finishing up <a href=\"/products/btpy8vdl\">Ultimate Campaign</a> so\
  \ it can go to the printer in a couple of weeks, launching the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/reignOfWinter\"\
  >Reign of Winter Adventure Path</a>, finalizing <a href=\"/products/btpy8qac\">Visions\
  \ of WAR: The Art of Wayne Reynolds</a>, designing and finalizing the Pathfinder\
  \ Adventure Card Game, and hatching schemes for 2014 and beyond.</p> \n    <p>All\
  \ of that effort has put a huge burden on our art department, who are trying like\
  \ mad to stay on top of all of our projects as we catch up from the holiday break\
  \ and ramp up to make sure all of our big summer releases come out on schedule.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>That means that while I'd intended to celebrate the release of the hattered\
  \ Star set with a complete reveal of high-quality photos of every figure that previously\
  \ had to settle for iPhone shots taken at my desk, in fact it's taking the art team\
  \ longer than anticipated to clean up all of the images, and I won't be able to\
  \ show off all of them just yet. </p> \n    <p>I think we'll simply plug the photos\
  \ missing after this blog into each figure's individual product page, rather than\
  \ making a big to-do out of it here in the Friday preview. This space is better\
  \ used for revealing cool, exciting figures you don't already own, after all, so\
  \ I only want to stretch this out as long as necessary.</p> \n    <p>(At this point\
  \ I should also add that the art team is ALSO cleaning up and finalizing photos\
  \ of some brand new figures from an upcoming release we have not yet announced,\
  \ so next week we're ready for some awesome new reveals anyway.)</p> \n    <p>But\
  \ before that happens, let's take a final look at some of the Shattered Star figures\
  \ you've probably only seen sitting on my desk, in early computer render form, or\
  \ under some other less-than-optimal condition. (Assuming you're not currently holding\
  \ them in your hand, of course.)</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a\
  \ href=\"/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK7089-41_500.jpeg\"><img src=\"/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK7089-41_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Here we have Koriah Azmeren, complete with\
  \ a cool glowing sword just like in the Wayne Reynolds image that inspired her.\
  \ Koriah has been around Pathfinder for a long time, first appearing as an author\
  \ of the Pathfinder Chronicles in <a href=\"/products/btpy85ej\">Into the Darklands</a>,\
  \ an early Pathfinder product written by our own James Jacobs. She's an amazing\
  \ figure, from the sculpt to the paint details, and we absolutely love her. Koriah\
  \ is rare figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK7089-43_500.jpeg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK7089-43_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>Next up is Xin, the legendary founder of Thassilon, precursor\
  \ to the dreaded Runelords! This guy has been lurking around Varisia for more than\
  \ 10,000 years, and when the PCs finally catch up with him I think it's fair to\
  \ say he probably looks rather different than this, his \"original\" appearance\
  \ (for how he looks today, see another figure in this set, though spoilers prevent\
  \ me from saying which one!). This is one of those figures that works great as a\
  \ specific NPC as well as a stand-in for just about any kind of diabolical high-level\
  \ wizard you need to throw at your player characters. Xin is a rare figure.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK7089-45_500.jpeg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK7089-45_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>Speaking of the insidious Runelords, up next we have Runelord\
  \ Sorshen, who makes a surprising appearance in the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/shatteredStar\"\
  >Shattered Star Adventure Path</a>. When combined with <a href=\"/products/btpy8sfi\"\
  >Runelord Karzoug</a>, we've now released two of the seven Runelords, covering the\
  \ sins of greed and lust. Perhaps future Pathfinder Battles releases will allow\
  \ you to complete the set! Runelord Sorshen is a rare figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK7089-38_500.jpeg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK7089-38_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>Most of you likely recognize our next figure, the lovable Lem,\
  \ Halfling Bard! Lem is our \"iconic\" bard, and has appeared in Pathfinder products\
  \ ever since he graced the covers of <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/curseOfTheCrimsonThrone\"\
  >Curse of the Crimson Throne</a>, our second-ever Pathfinder Adventure Path! (As\
  \ a bit of trivia, Lem gets his name from Lemmy, the lead singer of the heavy metal\
  \ band Mot√∂rhead, on account of their similar sideburns.) Lem is a rare figure.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK7089-44_500.jpeg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK7089-44_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>Here's another figure with roots that go back to <a href=\"\
  /pathfinder/adventurePath/curseOfTheCrimsonThrone\">Curse of the Crimson Throne</a>.\
  \ That campaign introduced the Gray Maidens, an all-female order of knights from\
  \ the city of Korvosa. Eva Widerman's original armor concept for these warriors\
  \ was so cool we put it on the back cover of the <a href=\"/products/btpy88yj\"\
  >Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</a>. When it came time to revisit certain Varisian\
  \ themes in the Shattered Star Adventure Path, we knew we wanted to revisit this\
  \ iconic group. Here we have Oriana, a Gray Maiden Commander, with Eva's original\
  \ costume design filtered through Wayne Reynolds. We think this rare figure looks\
  \ awesome! </p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK7089-10_500.jpeg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK7089-10_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>Let's move on to some monsters, shall we? Here we have the\
  \ Medium Air Elemental, a common figure cast in clear plastic and touched up with\
  \ some white highlights. Getting the colors right on this guy took several rounds\
  \ of approvals, but I'm pleased with how he finally turned out. It's always been\
  \ a major goal of mine to produce elementals at all the sizes in the <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8auu\">Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</a>, and the Shattered Star set covers\
  \ us for Medium and Large versions of the core four elemental types. </p> \n   \
  \ <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK7089-51_500.jpeg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK7089-51_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>Speaking of which, the set also includes this Large Air Elemental,\
  \ who frankly pushes the boundaries of a Large figure and starts hedging into quasi-Huge\
  \ territory. An actual Huge will have to wait for a future set (as will the Smalls),\
  \ but as I said above, Shattered Star certainly sets us off on a great start.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK7089-36_500.jpeg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK7089-36_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>Last up this week we've got the enormous Troll Champion, which\
  \ is one of my favorite figures in the entire set. This guy REALLY pushes the limit\
  \ of a Large figure, and he absolutely is as large as we envision trolls ever getting.\
  \ Yes, he towers over even some giants we've already released, but this guy is a\
  \ CHAMPION. An upcoming set will feature another type of troll that's more in line\
  \ with what we consider a \"regular\" troll to be, size-wise. Our <a href=\"/products/btpy8qjj\"\
  >original Troll</a>, in <a href=\"/products/btpy8mq6\">Heroes &amp; Monsters</a>,\
  \ was a bit too small. This guy is a bit too large (on purpose, because he's so\
  \ awesome). More trolls soon!</p> \n    <p>And that's it! By my count that leaves\
  \ four figures remaining for high-quality photos (the Grub Swarm, Glass Golem, Natalya\
  \ Vancaskerkin, and Sheila Heidmarch). We'll sneak them onto their respective singles\
  \ pages later this week, clearing the docket for something genuinely new next week.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Until then, I hope you enjoy opening and admiring your new Shattered\
  \ Star figures as much as we've enjoyed creating them for you!</p> \n    <p>Erik\
