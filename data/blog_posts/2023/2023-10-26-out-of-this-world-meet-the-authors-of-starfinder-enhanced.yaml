              <h3>Ivis K. Flanagan</h3>
              <p>Hi all! I'm Ivis K. Flanagan, freelance writer and teacher. Working on&nbsp;<em>Starfinder Enhanced</em>&nbsp;was an awesome highlight for me, as I got to work on a variety of sections: Themes, the Mystic Class updates, and some new creature companions. The creature companions were probably my favorite—and I cannot wait for everyone to get a look at the new furry (and not so furry) friends that I, among others, have gotten to bring to your table.</p>
              <p>Outside of&nbsp;<em>Starfinder Enhanced</em>, you can find my work in other Starfinder releases, as well as Pathfinder and other companies. A full list of my current credits can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://northerndreamer.carrd.com/">here</a>. As for me, when I'm not writing, you can often find me GMing games for anyone who wants to play! If you want to reach out about future projects, playing games, or just to chat, you can find me on&nbsp;<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/northerndreamer.bsky.social">Bluesky</a>&nbsp;or email me at ikflanagan at gmail.com.</p>
              <p><br></p>
              <h3>Jason Keeley (he/him)</h3>
              <p>Hi folks, I'm Jason Keeley (he/him) and come with me... to the stars! I contributed the narrative starship combat section to&nbsp;<em>Starfinder Enhanced</em>&nbsp;and it was an interesting challenge to streamline the normal starship combat rules while retaining some of the use of currently printed starship stat blocks. Hopefully, those who are looking for a more condensed experience will enjoy it! When I'm not doing things for Paizo, I spend my time recording for the Know Direction network, collaborating with Joe Pasini on puzzles, and generally working on other TTRPG projects—like my cereal mascot game This Compleat Breakfast, available for free at&nbsp;<a href="https://herzwesten.itch.io/this-compleat-breakfast">https://herzwesten.itch.io/this-compleat-breakfast</a>! You can usually find me under the name "herzwesten" on most social media platforms.</p>
              <p><br></p>
              <h3>Jessica Catalan</h3>
              <p>Hi everyone! My name’s Jessica Catalan and I’m the Starfinder Society Developer and a freelance author who primarily writes for the Pathfinder and Starfinder RPGs. My past works as a freelance author for Paizo include eight Organized Play scenarios, one adventure module, five Adventure Path volumes, cover credit on two hardcover books, and a whole lot more!&nbsp;<em>Starfinder Enhanced</em>&nbsp;is very much a love letter to Starfinder, and is packed to bursting with new options for every aspect of the game, as well as new subsystems, alternate ways to play, and enhanced versions of a few classes. Whatever kind of characters you play, and whatever kind of games you run, there’s something in&nbsp;<em>Starfinder Enhanced</em>&nbsp;for you. In addition to working on&nbsp;<em>Starfinder Enhanced</em>&nbsp;on the clock as a member of the Starfinder team, I worked on it as a freelance author. In short: I wrote a LOT for this book. Picking a favorite contribution is a challenge, but I’m most proud of creating novians and holograms (including initial pitching of these species) and writing the new uses for Resolve Points, which will provide players of all classes and builds a lot of fun new tricks. I hope the love and enthusiasm that everyone put into this book resonates with you and that you enjoy the huge amount of new options at your disposal. Now get out there and make some novians! Until next time, Starfinders!</p>

              <h3>John Compton</h3>
              <p>I’m John Compton, and&nbsp;<em>Starfinder Enhanced</em>&nbsp;was my final project as a Starfinder developer. What a fitting finale, too!&nbsp;<em>Starfinder Enhanced</em>&nbsp;gave me space to explore several big ideas that I’d aways wanted to see in the game, particularly the custom and upgradeable weapons and armor. You’ll also see my handiwork in the enhanced envoy, solarian, and witchwarper, as well as the several sections I developed before blasting off to the Pathfinder narrative team.</p>
              <p><br></p>
              <h3>John Curtin (he/him)</h3>
              <p>Hi, my name is John Curtin (he/him) and I had a blast contributing some of the feats and nanocyte options to&nbsp;<em>Starfinder Enhanced</em>! My primary design driver here was asking myself "what, as a player, would make me really excited to see as a potential option," and I my most fervent that at least one GM out there finds out about one of my options from a player and goes "...you can do what now?? That's awesome!!" Here at Paizo, I’ve got more Starfinder credits upcoming, but in true freelancer fashion, the projects I’m most excited to tell everyone about are still under NDA. To hear about my latest and greatest, you can follow me on BlueSky @curtinwrites, on the remains of Twitter @Curtin_Writes, and explore the currently inactive @StarfinderFacts.</p>
              <p><br></p>
              <h3>John Godek III (he/him)</h3>
              <p>Hi! I’m John, a gamer, gamemaster, freelance author, and podcaster in the Seattle area. I earned my 5th Nova for Starfinder Society two years ago and have worked on a dozen freelance assignments for Evil Robot Games, Legendary Games, and Paizo. My most recent work includes this summer’s&nbsp;<em>Starfinder Society Scenario #6-04: Secrets Long Submerged</em>&nbsp;and next year’s&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Tian Xia World Guide</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Character Guide</em>. For&nbsp;<em>Starfinder Enhanced</em>, I had the opportunity to create new class options for the mechanic, technomancer, and vanguard, plus new augmentations, magic items, and hybrid items.</p>
              <p>When I’m not playing, GMing, or writing, I produce three podcasts on the Know Direction Network:&nbsp;<em>Digital Divination</em>, a Starfinder talk show with Paizo Senior Developer Jason Keeley;&nbsp;<em>Intrepid Heroes</em>, a Starfinder actual play whose cast has included Eleanor Ferron, Rob Helm, Scott Keim, Ron and Stephanie Lundeen, Jason Tondro, and Mark Woolcott;&nbsp;<em>Presenting - Gamers Making Games</em>, an interview show where I chat with game designers, developers, artists, and editors.</p>
              <p>You can reach me on&nbsp;<em>X</em>&nbsp;(Twitter)&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/JohnGodekIII/">@JohnGodekIII</a>&nbsp;and find my podcasts at&nbsp;<a href="http://knowdirectionpodcast.com/">KnowDirectionPodcast.com</a>&nbsp;or on YouTube at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsZdh4esq72zRKacIFyDSGA">GamingDivination.com</a>. I am always looking for folks to interview!</p>

              <p>Hello! I’m Kate Baker, and I was delighted to contribute to&nbsp;<em>Starfinder Enhanced</em>! There is so much cool stuff coming your way in this book. I specifically worked on new grenades, and with so many grenades in the system already, I got to be very creative with introducing new options. I hope your PCs have fun with the new bombs! You can follow more about what I’m up to on BlueSky at @katebakerGM.</p>

              <p>Hello there! This is Michael Bramnik, often writing for Paizo's organized play adventures and elsewhere, but now I am here helping Enhance your Starfinder experience! For this book, I had the privilege of writing the Archetypes and Tech Items, and can't wait to see what you think of all of them. From the Major League Coach (who draws on sci-fi sports from other books as well as ones influenced by my SFS experiences) to the musical Audocyte (who emulates my constant need for music almost everywhere I go), each of these archetypes&nbsp;<em>enhance</em>&nbsp;aspects of the science fiction/fantasy genre in ways I hope each of you will love!</p>
              <p>Feel free to keep up with my ongoing projects if you'd like (<a href="https://canisdirus.carrd.co/">https://canisdirus.carrd.co/</a>), and happy gaming!</p>
