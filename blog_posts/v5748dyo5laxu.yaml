  \ \n   <p>I'm playing an alchemist in Josh Frost's Tuesday night game. Though I've\
  \ played many caster characters in my day, including some with item creation feats,\
  \ the alchemist class is <b>very</b> reliant on consumable itemsâ€”the mutagens, bombs,\
  \ extracts, potions, and alchemical items it creates. Inspired by Crystal Frasier's\
  \ use of our <a href=\"/gameMastery/itemPacks\">GameMastery Item Cards</a> for her\
  \ character's scrolls, I started to assemble a collection of potion and alchemical\
  \ cards for my character, Maro. However, given the number of formulas he knows,\
  \ plus three mutagens, bombs, and the many alchemical items already in the game\
  \ (plus more to come with <a href=\"/pathfinderCompanion/v5748btpy88wi\"><i>Adventurer's\
  \ Armory</i></a> later this month), I ended up with more than 20 cards, and given\
  \ that on any round I might be using <b>any</b> of them, sorting through them wasn't\
  \ as efficient as I'd like. So I built a one-page alchemist tracking sheet.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Using a combination of item card art, public domain art, things I drew\
  \ myself, and some manipulation with a graphics program, I now have a sheet that\
  \ shows Maro's three mutagens, his bombs, bottles for his known extracts, and bottles\
  \ for 12 of the most common alchemical items he may make, buy, or carry. Now when\
  \ he prepares a Dexterity mutagen (which he calls his \"snake potion\"), I draw\
  \ one box by the green mutagen bottle, and mark it off when he drinks it. Each day,\
  \ I draw a box by his bomb bottle for each of his daily uses and mark them off as\
  \ he throws them. Boxes go by the alchemical items he has and are likewise marked\
  \ off. The last section is extracts and potions, which serves a dual purpose as\
  \ he can create an extract or potion from any formula he knows. If he makes a potion,\
  \ I draw a box by it and write \"P\" in it so I remember it's a potion (usable by\
  \ anyone in the party); if he makes an extract that day, I draw a box with an \"\
  E\" in it so I know only he can use it.</p> \n   <p>This tracking sheet also makes\
  \ it easy if the other PCs need to grab a potion while Maro is unconscious; presumably\
  \ he's explained which potions are which or labeled them, and any ally trying to\
  \ find a <i>cure wounds</i> potion on his unconscious body can immediately tell\
  \ what to look for and if he has any available. It also prevents the ally from trying\
  \ to drink his extracts (which don't work for anyone but him).</p> \n   <p>The tracking\
  \ sheet I use actually has the names of Maro's mutagens (\"bear potion,\" \"gorilla\
  \ potion,\" and \"snake potion\") and formulas (<i>cure light wounds</i>, <i>disguise\
  \ self</i>, <i>enlarge person</i>, <i>expeditious retreat</i>, <i>jump</i>, <i>shield</i>,\
  \ and <i>true strike</i>) on it. I thought as a generic tool for any alchemist the\
  \ sheet is more useful without those names so you can customize the list for your\
  \ alchemist (or potion-brewer) PC, so the version here has blank spaces in those\
  \ areas. If you want to type your potion names onto the tracking sheet instead of\
  \ writing them by hand, the font I used is \"The Alchemist\" by S. John Ross's <a\
  \ href=\"http://www222.pair.com/sjohn/fonts.htm\" target=\"nofollow\">Cumberland\
  \ Fontworks</a> (see page 2 of that link). He has some really cool fonts on his\
  \ site (and some other gaming stuff). The fonts are free for noncommercial use,\
  \ and he gave permission for Paizo to use the font in this blog post. Thanks, S.J.R.!</p>\
