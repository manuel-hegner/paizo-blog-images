  \ Superstar Maps!</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, February 15, 2011</p> \n\
  \   <p>For <a href=\"/rpgsuperstar/previous/2011\">RPG Superstar</a> <a href=\"\
  /rpgsuperstar/previous/2011/previous/2010\">last year</a>, I put together a series\
  \ of quick map sketches with commentary on my personal blog in order to show different\
  \ map turnovers, ranging from absolutely pathetic to pretty good. This year, we've\
  \ migrated that information to here on the Paizo blog so it's easier for competitors\
  \ to find.</p> \n   <p>As a general tip, <b>make your maps legible</b>. If your\
  \ map is just a few wavy lines on the page, if your handwriting is so illegible\
  \ that only you can tell the difference between a 5 and a 9, if you can't draw a\
  \ straight line with a ruler, do whatever it takes to improve. You have to bring\
  \ your A-game. Just as your text has to stand on its own without a mini-you nearby\
  \ to explain it, your maps have to, too, and if a professional cartographer can't\
  \ decipher your map, their version of your map probably isn't going to match up\
  \ with your text.</p> \n   <p>So take a look at the map turnover examples below,\
  \ and try to make your map the best it can be. If you need inspiration for a <i>great</i>\
  \ map turnover, check out <a href=\"http://paizo.com/paizo/blog/tags/maps/v5748dyo5las6\"\
  >this Paizo blog</a> featuring the work of frequent contributor Tim Hitchcock. Pretty\
  \ stuff!</p> \n   <blockquote> \n    <p>I'm just putting these all together for\
  \ comparison's sake for the benefit of the competitors in this round.</p> \n   \
  \ <div align=\"center\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/RPGSuperstar/2011/mapSKR001.jpg\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"/image/content/RPGSuperstar/2011/mapSKR001_360.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>This map gets an \"F.\" This map is awful.\
  \ It's drawn in pencil and the scan barely shows the lines. I can't easily see where\
  \ everything is supposed to be. Even where I can see it, I don't know what it is!\
  \ Are those lines rivers? Are they forests? Lakes? What are those circles? Are those\
  \ letters or numbers next to them?</p> \n    <div align=\"center\">\n     <a href=\"\
  /image/content/RPGSuperstar/2011/mapSKR002.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"/image/content/RPGSuperstar/2011/mapSKR002_360.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Map, grade \"D.\" This map is marginally\
  \ better than the previous one. All I did was go over the pencil with a dark pen\
  \ so the lines would show up more clearly on the scan. I still don't know what these\
  \ lines represent, or the circles, and the numbering isn't even clear.<p.> \n  \
  \   </p.></p>\n    <div align=\"center\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/RPGSuperstar/2011/mapSKR003.jpg\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"/image/content/RPGSuperstar/2011/mapSKR003_360.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Map, grade \"C.\" This is a marked improvement,\
  \ but could still be clearer. It looks like the upper left border uses the old \"\
  use a humped line to indicate the edge of a forest.\" The big loop on the right\
  \ may be a lake, a giant mud pit, a swampy area, not entirely clear, but a quick\
  \ email to the designer would clear it up. Rather than generic circles, the four\
  \ locations use little icons--two forts or castles, some kind of ruin, and something\
  \ that's hopefully a cave but maybe is a giant eyeball. The numbers are clear and\
  \ legible. <br>If you can't draw forts, cities, or what have you, find a symbol\
  \ on the internet, print it out, and tape or glue it to your map before you scan\
  \ it. </p>\n    <p><a href=\"http://www.enworld.org/forum/attachments/art-gallery-cartography-miniatures-painting/25558d1156257041-map-symbols-mapsymbols1.jpg\"\
  \ target=\"nofollow\">This ENworld link</a> is a handy collection of common gaming\
  \ map symbols, and <a href=\"http://www.enworld.org/forum/attachments/art-gallery-cartography-miniatures-painting/25559d1156257041-map-symbols-mapsymbols2.jpg\"\
  \ target=\"nofollow\">here</a> is another.</p> \n    <div align=\"center\">\n  \
  \   <a href=\"/image/content/RPGSuperstar/2011/mapSKR004.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/RPGSuperstar/2011/mapSKR004_360.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>Map, grade \"B.\" This is the exact same map as the Grade C\
  \ map, except I colored in the forest and the blob on the right--green means forest,\
  \ blue means water (rather than mud or swamp or magical barrier). It doesn't matter\
  \ if you color it with colored pencils before you scan it or if you're using a coloring\
  \ tool on your scanned map--color helps clarify what you're depicting. </p> \n \
  \   <p>This map is still missing a compass (indicating north) and a scale marker,\
  \ so I'd still need to talk to the designer about it.</p> \n    <div align=\"center\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"/image/content/RPGSuperstar/2011/mapSKR005.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/RPGSuperstar/2011/mapSKR005_360.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>Map, grade \"A minus.\" Some map as before, except I actually\
  \ named the locations on the map as well as giving them numbers. I also added a\
  \ simple compass rose and a scale marker. </p> \n    <p>Note that the scale marker\
  \ is based on the grid size of the paper, which doesn't show up on the scan--if\
  \ squares are important (like in a dungeon), make sure the grid shows up so the\
  \ mapper knows what the scale is! </p> \n    <p>Also, because the resolution of\
  \ the scan may mean your map appears at a different size on your screen than the\
  \ mapper's screen, thus relative statements like \"1 inch = 1 mile\" may change;\
  \ always include an on-map scale marker so the mapper can determine the scale without\
  \ having to figure out at what DPI you scanned your map. <br>I give this map an\
  \ A- rather than an A because in some places the handwriting is a little sloppy;\
  \ if you have text on a map, it's best to include a text file turnover of all the\
  \ text on the map, spelled correctly. This allows the mapper to (1) just copy &amp;\
  \ paste the text onto the map, rather than puzzling out your handwriting, (2) cross\
  \ off each piece of text as he works on adding it to the map, so he doesn't miss\
  \ anything that's supposed to be there. </p> \n    <p>Thus, for this map, I should\
  \ include a text file that says: <br><b>1 Fort Zur</b><br><b>2 Fort Brun</b><br><b>3\
  \ The Ruin of Castle Happydeath</b><br><b>4 Ogre Lair</b><br><b>Bloodmurder Forest</b><br><b>Drownwicked\
  \ Lake</b><br><b>[[compass rose]]</b><br><b>1 square = 1 mile</b><br><br>(The last\
  \ two entries are mainly reminders rather than actual copy-paste goals... the cartographer\
  \ isn't going to put the text \"[[compass rose]]\" on the map. We're not expecting\
  \ Round 4 entries to include a map tags list, just make your map readable, please!)</p>\
  \ \n    <p>If your handwriting is bad, either use a text tool in your graphics program\
  \ to add text to the map, or print out the text, cut it out, and glue it onto the\
  \ map before scanning it.</p> \n    <p>Note that the A- map doesn't get an A- grade\
  \ for being awesome or interesting, it gets an A- for readability and how easily\
  \ the cartographer could turn this into a professional map. I am 99% sure that if\
  \ I handed this to a cartographer, he'd create a map that is exactly what I'm looking\
  \ for.</p> \n    <p>Note also that this map could be much more interesting, with\
  \ more details and such--but remember that the cartographer hasn't read your text\
  \ for the book, he doesn't know if all the extra little details are necessary for\
  \ your map, or if they're just flavor to make it look cool (for example, if you\
  \ draw a scrap of paper on the floor of a room, he doesn't know if you're trying\
  \ to make the room look more interesting, or if that paper is a vital clue the PCs\
  \ can find in the room). As you work with a company and a cartographer more, you'll\
  \ gain an understanding of the acceptable level of detail. For the purpose of RPG\
  \ Superstar, the priority is readable, functional maps, not creating maps that are\
  \ so awesome and detailed that you should be working as a professional cartographer\
  \ rather than a writer.</p> \n   </blockquote> \n   <p>Sean K Reynolds<br> Developer,\
