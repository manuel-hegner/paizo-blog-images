  \ Identity—showcasing the wide diversity of indigenous cultures and ways of life.</p>\n\
  \      <p>In celebration of Native American Heritage Month, we’ve reached out to\
  \ some of our Native contributors, who have built items inspired by their cultures!</p>\n\

  \      <p>I write for Pathfinder, Starfinder, and sometimes other games, and am\
  \ a whiz a converting between systems. When I’m not working on freelance for various\
  \ clients, I am developing a storytelling card game with my husband. You can find\
  \ me on Twitter @DavidRossWorlds Bluesky @davidnross and via other contact options\
  \ on my linktree:&nbsp;<a title=\"https://linktr.ee/davidnross\" href=\"https://linktr.ee/davidnross\"\
  >https://linktr.ee/davidnross</a></p>\n      <p>My mother’s family has always kept\
  \ at least one dreamcatcher, a traditional Anishinaabe ward against bad dreams.\
  \ It’s true that nightmares have always been fortuitously rare for me at least,\
  \ especially since my grandma gave me one of my own. It certainly doesn’t hurt that\
  \ mine reminds me every day I see it of family even when I am far away.</p>\n  \
  \    <p><b>Dreamcatcher — Item 6</b><br><b>Magical</b><br><b>Price</b> 180 gp <br><b>Usage</b>\
  \ affixed to a structure, tent, or tree; <b>Bulk</b> L</p>\n      <p>This willow\
  \ hoop is strung with a web of plant fibers and fragrant sweetgrass and adorned\
  \ with beads. The <em>dreamcatcher</em> automatically attempts to counteract any\
  \ spell or magical effect that would force a sleeping creature within 10 feet of\
  \ it to attempt a saving throw (counteract DC 20, counteract level of 3). An effect\
  \ counteracted by the <em>dreamcatcher</em> creates a minor decoration representing\
  \ it to appear in the <em>dreamcatcher’s</em> web, wobbling occasionally like a\
  \ fly in a spiderweb, that vanishes when exposed to sunlight. A creature adjacent\
  \ to the <em>dreamcatcher</em> can study such a decoration to attempt to Identify\
  \ the Magic that triggered its creation. The dreamcatcher only triggers once per\
  \ night.</p>\n      <br>\n      <h3>Mahpiya</h3>\n      <p>Bannock holds a special\
  \ place on the prairies as a symbol of our adaptability and resilience. We were\
  \ introduced to the food through the fur trade, and it stuck with us as we were\
  \ forced into the reservation system, turning government rations into nourishment\
  \ for our people. The process of making bannock itself is the process of learning\
  \ our history. I carry memories of listening to my mothers, my grandmothers, and\
  \ the other elders in my life (pidamayeye, Kokum Brenda and Grandma Bear) as we\
  \ cooked together, shared food, and shared stories, both of our own lives and the\
  \ lives of those who came before. Through food we remember our past, and the stories\
  \ that guided us through it.</p>\n      <p>You can find me slowly trying to figure\
  \ out bluesky @Mahpiya. Just don’t ask me for the recipe, it’s a family secret.</p>\n\
  \      <p><b>Bannock of Echoing Wisdom — Item 3</b><br><b>Alchemical, Consumable</b><br><b>Price</b>\
  \ 10 gp<br><b>Usage</b> held in 1 hand; <b>Bulk</b> L<br><b>Activate</b> 10 minutes\
  \ (manipulate)</p>\n      <p>Cooked over a campfire and dipped into wozapi, <em>bannock\
  \ of echoing wisdom</em> instills you with voices of the past, allowing you to recount\
  \ any story you’re heard.</p>\n      <p>After eating the bannock, your mind is filled\
  \ with the images, words, body language, and cadence of a story you have previously\
  \ heard, allowing you to recount the story effortlessly with perfect memory. You\
  \ gain a +1 item bonus to Performance checks to recount this story and a +1 item\
  \ bonus to Recall Knowledge about subjects discussed within the story. These bonuses\
  \ last 24 hours or until you make your next daily preparations, whichever comes\
  \ first.</p>\n      <br>\n      <h3>Marlowe Miller</h3>\n      <p>Nawwih! The <em>sun-blessed\
  \ corn pounder</em> is based on one of my favorite and most memorable Caddo stories,\
  \ \"The Young Man and the Cannibals.\" In it, a young man is trying to find his\
  \ brothers and finds they've been eaten by a family of cannibals. The young man\
  \ is saved by an unseen, unknown force (later revealed to be the Sun) from death\
  \ by long-nosed iron mask and told to run, take a corn pounder from an old woman\
  \ cannibal, and kill the cannibal family. I love this story because of the iconic\
  \ symbols of the corn pounder and the long-nosed iron mask, and how it speaks to\
  \ the running theme in our cultural hero stories of taking leaps of faith and persevering\
  \ even in the direst of situations.</p>\n      <p>I'm a pretty solid social media\
  \ hermit, but I can be found on the social media platform formerly known as Twitter\
  \ @diwasti_ or on bluesky @diwasti.bsky.social. Alternatively, I can be emailed\
  \ directly at&nbsp;<a title=\"mailto:genesysfrog@gmail.com\" href=\"mailto:genesysfrog@gmail.com\"\
  >genesysfrog@gmail.com</a>!</p>\n      <p><b>Sun-Blessed Corn Pounder — Item 5</b><br><b>Uncommon,\
  \ Magical</b><br><b>Price</b> 150 gp<br><b>Usage</b> held in 2 hands; <b>Bulk</b>\
  \ 2<br></p>\n      <p>Nine rings line the haft of this mighty wooden corn pounder\
  \ (a <em>+1 striking greatclub</em>), topped by a broad head with sun symbols burned\
  \ into the surface. The narrow end is worn smooth from years of use. A very long\
  \ time ago, this corn pounder was used to slay cannibalistic undead in an act of\
  \ desperate survival by a young man, and the nine rings represent the nine brothers\
  \ killed by the cannibalistic undead. While wielding the <em>sun-blessed corn pounder</em>,\
  \ you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to attacks against undead creatures.</p>\n  \
  \    <p><strong>Activate—Beseech the Sun</strong> [free-action] (concentrate, fire,\
  \ light) <strong>Frequency</strong> once per day; <strong>Trigger</strong> You critically\
  \ succeed at a Strike against an enemy; <strong>Effect</strong> You call upon divine\
  \ powers to aid you in your time of need. Searing sunlight erupts from the broad\
  \ head of the <em>sub-blessed</em><em>corn pounder</em>. After the normal effects\
  \ of the critical hit, the target must attempt a DC 21 Fortitude save.</p>\n   \
  \   <p><strong>Failure </strong>The target is stupefied 1 until the end of the target’\
  s next turn.</p>\n      <p><strong>Critical Failure </strong>The target is stupefied\
  \ 1 until the end of your next turn, and you deal an additional 1d4 fire damage\
  \ to your next damage roll against that creature before the end of your next turn.</p>\n\
  \      <br>\n      <h3>Shay Snow</h3>\n      <p>Not many Caddo recipes have survived\
  \ to the current day, so the few recipes I have access to, I treasure. Caddo fish\
  \ relish is a recipe I remember my aunties and Yeye preparing in large batches before\
  \ canning it in mason jars and storing it away to eat with pretty much anything.\
  \ It’s spicy and briny and we’ve always joked could be used as a weapon in a pinch!\
  \ Some Caddo language learning time: this relish is made with daháw (onion), hasahk’\
  uh ch’ántinu’ (unripe green tomato), and kah’án:k’as (spicy pepper)!</p>\n     \
  \ <p><b>Fish Relish — Item 1+</b><br><b>Acid, Alchemical, Bomb, Consumable, Splash</b><br><b>Usage</b>\
  \ held in 1 hand; <b>Bulk</b> L<br><b>Activate</b> [one-action] Strike</p>\n   \
  \   <p>This canning jar is secured with a screw top metal lid and filled to the\
  \ brim with a chopped mixture of onions, green unripe tomatoes, various hot peppers,\
  \ and plenty of spices and vinegar to ensure a spicy, pickled mix perfect for eating\
  \ with freshwater fish. In a pinch, the relish can additionally be used as an offensive\
  \ bomb that will also perfectly complement an unconscious enemy.</p>\n      <p><strong>Type\
  \ </strong>mild; <strong>Level</strong> 1; <strong>Price</strong> 4 gp<br>\n   \
  \     The mild fish relish bomb deals 1d4 bludgeoning damage, plus 1d4 persistent\

  \ +1 item bonus to attack rolls. The spicy fish relish bomb deals 2d4 bludgeoning\
  \ damage, plus 2d4 persistent acid damage and 2 acid splash damage.</p>\n      <p><strong>Type\
  \ </strong>well-preserved; <strong>Level</strong> 11; <strong>Price</strong> 250\
  \ gp<br>\n        You gain a +2 item bonus to attack rolls. The well-preserved fish\

  \      <p>Hey all! Rue here again, still a proud Indiginerd and the Marketing &amp;\
  \ Media Specialist here at Paizo! One of the joys of my experience as a game designer\
  \ is getting to see my cultures brought to the table in a variety of systems and\
  \ settings. Finally, the stories that we were punished for singing can be told to\
  \ new generations.</p>\n      <p>The ghost dance was part of a resurgence of Arapaho\
  \ culture in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and remains a cultural tradition\
  \ and festival for North and South Arapaho peoples. Through the ghost dance, we\
  \ reconnect with our ancestors, as well as send our energy forward to future generations,\
  \ so that our knowledge can be shared, along with our triumph and sorrow. An act\
  \ of protest at its inception, the ghost dance remains a symbol of Arapaho culture’\
  s resilience. As the sun sets only to rise again, we too shall continue to rise.</p>\n\
  \      <p><b>Ghost Dance Dress — Item 5</b><br><b>Invested, Magical</b><br><b>Price</b>\
  \ 125 gp<br><b>Usage</b> worn; <b>Bulk</b> L</p>\n      <p>This flowing dress is\
  \ fringed in ribbons with beads and feathers woven in. Delicate hand-embroidery,\
  \ beadwork, and dyeing turns this garment into a moving representation of the cycles\
  \ of life and death, rain and drought, growth and burning. The <em>ghost dance dress</em>connects\
  \ the living and the dead. You gain a +1 item bonus to Diplomacy checks against\
  \ spirits.</p>\n      <p><strong>Activate—Ghost Dance</strong> [one-action] (concentrate)\
  \ <strong>Frequency</strong> once per hour; <strong>Effect</strong> The rhythm of\
  \ your ancestors’ feet upon the ground spurs you on, giving you a +1 circumstance\
  \ bonus to your next melee Strike before the end of your turn.</p>\n      <p><strong>Activate—\
  Wind Cry</strong> [two-actions] (manipulate) <strong>Frequency</strong> once per\
  \ day; <strong>Effect</strong> The wind whips up around you, whispering and shrieking\
  \ of the shadows that have passed here. The ghost dance dress casts <em>fear</em>\
  \ with a DC of 21.</p>\n      <br>\n      <p>Thank you so much to our contributors\
  \ for sharing these snippets of their culture with us (and giving us more items\
