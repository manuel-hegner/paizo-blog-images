  \ this week trying to get some books to the printer, so I’ll keep this one short\
  \ and sweet.</span></p> \n     <p><b>If you use Two-Weapon Fighting on your turn\
  \ to attack with two weapons, do you also take that penalty on attacks of opportunity\
  \ made before the start of your next turn? How long do the penalties last?</b></p>\
  \ \n     <p>No, the penalties end as soon as you have completed the full-attack\
  \ action that allowed you to attack with both weapons. Any attacks of opportunity\
  \ you make are at your normal attack bonus. Generally speaking, penalties on attacks\
  \ made during your turn do not carry over to attacks of opportunity unless they\
  \ specifically state otherwise (such as the penalty from using Power Attack).</p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>Can you pick up or manipulate an object in a square within your reach?\
  \ Does this provoke an attack of opportunity? Does it provoke even if the foe can\
  \ reach the object, but not your space?</b></p> \n     <p>The rules are a little\
  \ hazy here, but to put it simply, you can affect objects and creatures within your\
  \ reach. When picking up or manipulating objects, you generally provoke an attack\
  \ of opportunity, but only against foes that can reach your space. You do not provoke\
  \ attacks of opportunity from foes that cannot reach you, no matter what action\
  \ you are taking, even if it includes reaching into a threatened space. Although\
  \ it might seem realistic to allow an attack in such a case, it would make the game\
  \ far too complicated.</p> \n     <p><b>Can I take a 5-foot step in the middle of\
  \ my attempt to use the Cleave feat, to bring another foe within reach?</b></p>\
  \ \n     <p>No. Cleave is a special action and the conditions for that action are\
  \ checked at the moment you begin your action. At that moment, all of the available\
  \ targets are checked to make sure they adjacent to each other and within reach.\
  \ You cannot take a 5-foot step in the middle of the action and check conditions\
  \ again. If you do not have two targets within reach, adjacent to each other at\
  \ the start of the attack, you could not even attempt to make an attack using Cleave.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Well, I hope that clears up a few things. See you all next week.</p>\
