  \     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">\"Got us between Hell and\
  \ high water again, Captain!\" Giant ducked spray and shot a glare to her captain.\
  \ She didn't have to duck much; even standing on a box step, the halfling was barely\
  \ tall enough to see over the ship's wheel.</p> \n      <p> Devrin Arlos just laughed\
  \ and eyed the six Chelish warships closing in on them. They'd chased <em>Nightwave</em>\
  \ all the way from the Arch of Aroden, along the coast of Rahadoum, and through\
  \ the treacherous Jagged Reach. They weren't likely to give up now. Ahead loomed\
  \ the Eye of Abendego. </p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190627-highseas.jpg\"\

  Wouldn't have it any other way. Don't worry! <em>Nightwave</em> can take it!\" </p>\
  \ \n      <p> She struggled with the wheel. \"Maybe time to put a reef in the forecourse?\"\
  \ </p> \n      <p> \"Long past time, but I was hoping—\" A crack louder than a ballista\
  \ shot pierced the howl of the wind, drawing his attention back to their nearest\
  \ pursuer. \"Hoping for that.\" </p> \n      <p> The foremost Corentine frigate's\
  \ foretopmast shattered, falling with yards of shredded canvas and a mile of tangled\
  \ cordage. Sailors scrambled to hack the wreckage away, but the ship slewed off\
  \ course, and jibed her mizzen boom, ripping yet more canvas. </p> \n      <p> \"\
  Payback's a bitch!\" Vulmia Manux, Devrin's navigator and general fix-it go-to,\
  \ shook an ebony fist at the struggling ship. The Mwangi half-elf was still sore\
  \ that <em>Nightwave</em> had been damaged by the Corentines’ hell-spawned minions.\
  \ The Corentines were out of devils now, and clearly intended to overpower the Firebrand\
  \ ship with brute force. </p> \n      <p> \"Reef the forecourse and tops'ls.\" Devrin\
  \ squinted forward. \"Take her a point to starboard, Giant. Batten down and rig\
  \ lifelines! We're going in!\" </p> \n      <p> The crew responded without question.\
  \ The outer wall of the perpetual storm towered in a burgeoning barrier of torrential\
  \ rain and wind, mountainous seas, and deadly currents. A glance back confirmed\
  \ that their pursuers were also shortening sail, but hadn't broken off the chase.\
  \ </p> \n      <p> \"Come and get me, you bastards!\" Devrin shouted. </p> \n  \
  \    <p> \"You taking this personal, Captain?\" <em>Nightwave</em>'s bosun, Gaspiya,\
  \ dropped down from the mizzen shrouds, eyeing him with concern, her lip curled\
  \ back from her short tusks. </p> \n      <p> \"No, but somebody's got to teach\
  \ them that they don't own the whole damned sea!\" He clapped Vulmia on her shoulder\
  \ and grinned. \"Don't worry. We've got them right where we want them.\" </p> \n\
  \      <p> \"Sorry, sir.\" Vulmia nodded and squinted into the screaming wind. \"\
  I just think we might have bit off more than we can chew. Six to one?\" </p> \n\
  \      <p> \"I said, don't worry! That's my job, right?\" Devrin flashed a rakish\
  \ smile and pointed to the impending wall of the storm. \"Give Giant a hand at the\
  \ helm and hold fast! We're in for a trouncing!\" </p> \n      <p> The storm hit\
  \ them like a charging bull, with rain so thick he could barely see their nearest\
  \ pursuer slashing hard enough to sting exposed skin. The seas mounted to vertical\
  \ walls higher than <em>Nightwave</em>'s topsails, their plunging tops threatening\
  \ to overwhelm them. <em>Nightwave</em> staggered as a wave broke over the ship’\
  s stern, and Devrin struggled to stay put in the waist-deep deluge. Lightning lit\
  \ the sky in sheets, but the captain howled and laughed into the teeth of the storm.\
  \ </p> \n      <p> \"Captain!\" Devrin's cabin boy, a stout young man from Katapesh,\
  \ pointed abeam. \"They're trying to cut us off!\" </p> \n      <p> Devrin shielded\
  \ his eyes and squinted at the Corentine frigate, <em>Helldawn</em>, plunging down\
  \ a towering wave. \"How in bloody blue blazes did they—\" Then he spotted the tornado\
  \ of animate water at the ship's bow, pulling on two thick ropes like a massive\
  \ draft horse. \"They've summoned an elemental!\" </p> \n      <p> A webbed hand\
  \ closed on Devrin's shoulder. \"It's time, Captain.\" </p> \n      <p> He turned\
  \ to look into the blue-on-blue features of Ris, an undine and recent addition to\
  \ his crew. It had been Ris who had told him about the Chelish plan to dump tons\
  \ of toxic mine tailings onto a submarine merfolk city in the Hellmouth Gulf. At\
  \ his behest, she had delved the depths to warn the merfolk. With no way to forestall\
  \ the Chelish, the merfolk had evacuated their city, saving tens of thousands of\
  \ lives. Now was the time for retribution. </p> \n      <p> \"You're sure, Ris?\
  \ The seas—\" </p> \n      <p> Another wave buried <em>Nightwave</em>'s quarterdeck,\
  \ but while the rest of them struggled to stay upright, Ris reveled in the torrent,\
  \ her lips curving from pearly teeth in glee. The deluge flowed off her blue skin\
  \ and sharkskin leathers, lending strength to her slim frame. </p> \n      <p> \"\
  I'm sure, my captain.\" Ris lifted a willowy arm to point to a towering swell, a\
  \ hundred feet of sheer water. Lightning lit the sky behind the wave, illuminating\
  \ thousands of sinuous shapes within. </p> \n      <p> Devrin's mouth dropped open\
  \ at the sight. A vast school of merfolk, tridents in hand, their marine minions\
  \ swimming along with them, shapes enormous and terrible, yet beautiful. </p> \n\
  \      <p> \"Sing them a song, Ris!\" </p> \n      <p> \"I will, my captain.\" She\
  \ pulled the lyre from her back, an enchanted instrument crafted from shell, narwhal\
  \ horn, and mother of pearl. A wave crested to break against the ship's quarter,\
  \ and Ris dove straight into the tortuous sea. </p> \n      <p> \"Hope she hurries\
  \ up!\" Vulmia shouted over the roar of wind and water. \"They're getting close!\"\
  \ </p> \n      <p> Indeed, <em>Helldawn</em> was closing fast. At the peak of a\
  \ swell, the ship yawed, and ballistae cracked. The deadly bolts flew at <em>Nightwave</em>\
  \ with unerring accuracy, holing sails, smashing into the hull, and impaling flesh.\
  \ Devrin bellowed for the ship's cleric, Rikkan, to see to the injured, even as\
  \ the holed sails tore to shreds in the hurricane winds. Vulma, Gaspiya, and the\
  \ top-crews clambered up the ratlines like spiders to cut away the torn canvas,\
  \ but the damage was done. <em>Nightwave</em> slewed with the uneven strain and\
  \ nearly broached on a towering wave. </p> \n      <p> \"Captain!\" Giant screamed,\
  \ fighting the wheel with all her strength. \"She'll roll on the next one if we\
  \ don't get some sail aloft!\" </p> \n      <p> Devrin fought his way to the binnacle\
  \ and flung open the hatch beneath the compass. There, in a golden frame, sat an\
  \ apple-sized emerald glowing with an inner light, <em>Nightwave</em>'s heart. </p>\
  \ \n      <p> The captain placed a hand on the gem and spoke low. \"Spirits of the\
  \ deep, hear my call. Claim your places at my side! Make sail!\" </p> \n      <p>\
  \ The spirits of a hundred and one sailors lost at sea surged from the gem in a\
  \ translucent torrent, racing aloft, untouched by the hurricane winds. Ethereal\
  \ canvas billowed on ghostly winds to pull <em>Nightwave</em> upright. Her bow pointed\
  \ down the next towering swell, and they raced forth. The ghostly sails faded away\
  \ quickly, but they had saved the ship. </p> \n      <p> The burst of speed had\
  \ taken them out of range of <em>Helldawn</em>'s ballistae, but for how long? The\
  \ peak of a wave blocked their view of <em>Helldawn</em>, but then both ships rose,\
  \ and Devrin saw their salvation surging from the depths. </p> \n      <p> \"She\
  \ rises!\" he bellowed, as the behemoth surged from the sea, an orca of such massive\
  \ size that it dwarfed the leviathans of the deep. </p> \n      <p> The monstrous\
  \ whale breeched to the height of <em>Helldawn</em>'s main crosstrees, and came\
  \ down amidships. Timbers snapped like kindling, planks exploding with the horrific\
  \ impact. The ship's keel snapped with a report that Devrin felt through the soles\
  \ of his boots. The ship foundered, broken in half, two hundred sailors, gone in\
  \ one moment of vengeance. </p> \n      <p> \"Payback!\" Vulmia screamed from aloft,\
  \ and the captain and crew of <em>Nightwave</em> cheered. </p> \n      <p> In a\
  \ moment of eerie clarity, the torrential rains ceased. The remaining Corentine\
  \ ships stood there, stark against the raging storm. </p> \n      <p> Then, from\
  \ the sea, vengeance rose like a plague of demons from the abyss. </p> \n      <p>\
  \ Tentacles ensnared one ship, tearing at wood and flesh, while the jaws of a megalodon\
  \ ripped at the hull of another. Thousands of merfolk surged up the sides of a third,\
  \ their tridents crackling with electricity, torrents of water blasting Chelish\
  \ sailors and marines off the deck. A fourth ship surged upward as a vast shape\
  \ thrust up from beneath. The dragon turtle's spiked shell smashed through the deck\
  \ of the ship, and the beast thrashed, splintering wood and crushing sailors. The\
  \ last ship in the armada tried to flee, but the sea behind them frothed with the\
  \ fury of the merfolk. In their haste, the Corentine captain must have forgotten\
  \ about the storm. A breaking sea took them on the beam, and the ship capsized,\
  \ masts snapping like felled trees. When the wave rolled past, there was nothing\
  \ left but flotsam. </p> \n      <p> Devrin stared in silent shock for a long moment.\
  \ Six ships, twelve <em>hundred</em> sailors...gone. </p> \n      <p> \"Captain.\"\
  \ Ris touched her captain's shoulder, and he turned to see the undine's sorrow.\
  \ \"I'm sorry. I sang the song of vengeance to them. They needed no such encouragement.\"\
  \ </p> \n      <p> \"I wish we could have let that last ship go, just to take the\
  \ message back to Cheliax.\" He scanned the sea, but it was clear that there would\
  \ be no survivors. \"Maybe it would have prevented another incident like this.\"\
  \ </p> \n      <p> \"Perhaps.\" Ris shook her head. \"But the sea is a harsh mistress,\
  \ and even Hell lacks the wrath to thwart her will.\"</p> \n      <p>Chris A. Jackson<br>\
