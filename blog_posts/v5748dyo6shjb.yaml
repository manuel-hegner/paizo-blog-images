  \   <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\"></p> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Welcome\
  \ to 2021! How about a playtest to start off with a bang? After not participating\
  \ in the <em>Pathfinder Secrets of Magic</em> playtest and reading the feedback\
  \ from our players and GMs, we put our heads together to come up with a way to engage\
  \ our Organized Play community that worked within the Pathfinder Society framework.\
  \ We settled on a model based on the Starfinder Society method that will allow our\
  \ community to participate in the <em>Pathfinder Guns &amp; Gears playtest</em>\
  \ (see the announcement <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shja?Shooting-Toward-a-New-Horizon\"\
  >here</a>). This framework works within established Society guidelines, doesn’t\
  \ leave credit on unusable characters, and encourages players to get involved. We\
  \ believe this method is flexible enough to use for future playtests and will add\
  \ a section to the Guides to Organized Play to provide guidance to players and GMs.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>But enough with the whys and wherefores. Let’s get to the details: </p>\

  \ Art by Roberto Pitturru</p>\n     </div> \n     <p><b>Playtest Period</b>: Pathfinder\
  \ Society participation in the Guns &amp; Gears playtest runs from publication on\
  \ <b>January 5</b> to <b>February 5, 2021</b>. Once this period has expired, players\
  \ can no longer use the gunslinger or inventor playtest classes until their publication\
  \ in a future Pathfinder product.</p> \n     <p><b>Playtest Classes</b>: This playtest\
  \ includes the gunslinger and inventor classes as outlined in the Guns &amp; Gears\
  \ playtest <a href=\"https://paizo.com/pathfinderplaytest\">found here</a>.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>How It Works</b>: We're opening up Society play for the playtest\
  \ classes via the use of custom created characters that operate much like our pregenerated\
  \ characters. We believe this should encourage players to test the waters with custom\
  \ builds, be it with current scenarios or through our growing stable of repeatable\
  \ options.</p> \n     <p><b>Creating a Playtest Character</b>: Prior to playing\
  \ a scenario during the playtest period, a player can determine if they want to\
  \ playtest either of the new classes. The character must have all levels in a single\
  \ playtest class, and not take archetypes. Although archetypes are important for\
  \ the playtest as a whole, we're limiting play to single classes in the Organized\
  \ play portion of the playtest for simplicity. Depending on the tier of the scenario,\
  \ the player can then use a 1st-, 3rd-, or 5th-level character using the eligible\
  \ playtest classes and created using the following guidelines.</p> \n     <ul style=\"\
  list-style-type:none;\"> \n      <li><em>1st Level</em>: The character can be made\
  \ using the character creation rules presented in the Pathfinder Core Rulebook and\
  \ <a hrerf=\"http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/paizo/guides/pfs2guide-en/\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Guide to Organized Play: Pathfinder Society</a>.</li> \n   \
  \   <li><em>3rd Level</em>: This character follows the same rules as above, except\
  \ they can select one 2nd-level and two 1st-level permanent items. In addition,\
  \ the player can spend up to 25 gp on other available equipment.</li> \n      <li><em>5th\
  \ Level</em>: This character follows the same rules as above, except they can select\
  \ one 4th-level, two 3rd-level, one 2nd-level, and two 1st-level permanent items.\
  \ In addition, the player can spend up to 50 gp on other available equipment.</li>\
  \ \n     </ul> \n     <p>Credit: Choose which of your characters will receive the\
  \ credit at the beginning of the adventure. The credit earned for playing a Guns\
  \ &amp; Gears playtest character follows the same rules and guidelines as applying\
  \ credit for a pregenerated character, presented in the Applying Credit section\
  \ of the Player Basics page of the Guide to Organized Play: Pathfinder Society.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>With all this in mind, we encourage our players to take an active part\
  \ in the Guns &amp; Gears playtest, both by sharing your opinions online in the\
  \ <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/forums/pathfinder/second/gunsAndGearsPlaytest\"\
  >playtest forums</a> and by completing the <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/GGOpenResponse\"\
  >playtest surveys</a>. We hope that by opening up the means in which players can\
  \ create and customize characters for the playtest, that we can see some unique\
  \ and fun builds using these new classes and that such tests will provide the design\
  \ team with priceless field-agent feedback!</p> \n     <p>We’ll see you back on\
  \ January 7 for our first monthly update of 2021. </p> \n     <p>Until then, don’\
  t forget to explore, report, and cooperate!</p>\n     <p> </p>\n     <p style=\"\
