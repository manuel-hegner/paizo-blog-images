  \ class=\"PTales\"></div></a> \n   <h1>A Tomb of Winter's Plunder</h1> \n   <p>by\
  \ Tim Pratt</p> \n   <h2>Chapter One: Taking the Waters</h2> \n   <p>Alaeron sat,\
  \ naked, on a natural stone bench in the sacred pool, the chest-deep water just\
  \ a bit warmer than his own blood. He leaned into a fortuitous hollow in the rock,\
  \ closed his eyes—hardly necessary, considering the depth of darkness in the cave—\
  and let the healing waters soothe him. Or tried to. He'd paid enough to be soothed,\
  \ at the very least.</p> \n   <p>The Balneal Springs retreat, nestled in the northern\
  \ hills of Andoran east of Darkmoon Vale, was home to legendary waters that reportedly\
  \ cured arthritis, muscle atrophy, toothache, heavy metal poisoning, and spiritual\
  \ malaise. Alaeron suffered from none of those ailments, which might have explained\
  \ why he didn't feel particularly cured now. He was young, in good condition (being\
  \ unusually physically active for an alchemist), blessed with fine teeth, always\
  \ careful when handling quicksilver and other toxic materials, and possessed with\
  \ a combination of curiosity and impulsiveness that insured he would never be bored.\
  \ Despite his rosy health, he'd come to Balneal to take the waters anyway.</p> \n\
  \   <p>And by \"take the waters,\" he meant <i>take</i> the waters. He'd gathered\
  \ samples from all the other springs on the property already, many of the pools\
  \ hellishly hot and stinking of rotten eggs (from sulfur, not magic, as some more\
  \ ignorant folk supposed). The volcanic activity to the north presented itself in\
  \ a somewhat gentler aspect here, with bubbling hot springs that were locally renowned,\
  \ if not as famous as the Brimstone Springs of Nidal.</p> \n   <p>The final waters\
  \ he needed to sample were here in, Hanspur's Bath—a sacred spring-fed pool deep\
  \ in a black cave where the foreign river deity was reputed to have paused once,\
  \ on a journey to the sea. Alaeron's visit to the retreat, and access to this cave,\
  \ had cost a tidy sum of gold he'd earned translating a profane text for a deranged\
  \ patron. The profiteering priests who ran the retreat guarded their secrets closely,\
  \ but despite the enforced nudity in this sacred chamber, Alaeron had smuggled in\
  \ a bag made of thin watertight material, wadded up and hidden in his cheek. Unfolded\
  \ and filled, the bag would hold a few precious ounces of liquid. Once full it would\
  \ be too large to smuggle out the same way, but he had a plan to stash the bag in\
  \ a dark crevice by the entryway and return later to create a distraction—explosions\
  \ were quite distracting, he'd found—which would enable him to duck inside the cave\
  \ mouth and retrieve the bag.</p> \n   <p>The plan was a bit elaborate, and more\
  \ than a little dangerous, but what matter was the risk of life and limb in the\
  \ service of his art? If the waters really were as efficacious as the priests and\
  \ satisfied customers claimed, their properties should prove useful in his work,\
  \ and could be diluted to create a score of potions to cure—or cause—an impressive\
  \ variety of ailments physical and spiritual. </p> \n   <p>He took the bag from\
  \ his mouth and prepared to fill it—then froze when he heard a splash on the far\
  \ side of the pool. He had not been promised a private visit to the healing waters\
  \ (that option was far too expensive for him), but he'd deliberately come early\
  \ in the morning, when most of the wealthy visitors to Balneal would be sleeping\
  \ or gorging themselves at breakfast. </p> \n   <p>Alaeron wasn't sure whether he\
  \ should speak, as the etiquette of sitting in a black pool of magical water was\
  \ not something he'd ever had occasion to learn. Before he could decide, the newcomers\
  \ began talking.</p> \n   <p>\"It would be an adventure,\" a voice—male, hearty,\
  \ and self-confident—said. \"The sort of bold act that made the Selmy family great.\"\
  </p> \n   <p>\"I'm not sure breaking into my dead thrice-great-grand-uncle's crypt\
  \ compares to traveling to far lands for pillage and war,\" a second voice said—\
  also male, but rather less hearty and confident.</p> \n   <p>\"Oh, come, your whole\
  \ family is founded on ancestral fortunes anyway. Raiding your uncle's tomb would\
  \ be much the same, just... more direct.\"</p> \n   <p>\"The treasures are supposed\
  \ to be fabulous,\" the second voice—presumably a Selmy—said. \"But I can't imagine\
  \ they'd be easy to carry out. Uncle Brant had all his favorite things buried with\
  \ him. He left us his <i>money</i>, at least some of it, but he was particular about\
  \ his <i>things</i>, by all accounts. I'm sure there must be protections against\
  \ graverobbers. Traps, and so forth. I'd rather not die on this trip, Rodrick. I'm\
  \ here for my health, after all.\"</p> \n   <div class=\"blurb360\">\n    <a href=\"\

  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    <br> Alaeron is more scholar than warrior, but explosives\
  \ have a funny way of solving problems.\n   </div> \n   <p>\"Nonsense, Simeon,\"\
  \ Rodrick replied. \"We know about the wards he laid to protect his barrow—only\
  \ the blood of a Selmy can open the door, isn't that right? The fact that he made\
  \ it possible for you to open the door suggests he <i>wanted</i> some descendant\
  \ to come take his treasures away someday, doesn't it?\"</p> \n   <p>\"More likely\
  \ he just wanted someone capable of setting him free if he was accidentally entombed\
  \ alive,\" Simeon said. \"Or perhaps to return occasionally and <i>leave</i> treasure,\
  \ or shoo away spiders, or do a bit of light cleaning.\" A long pause. \"My great-grandfather\
  \ remembered Uncle Brant, from when he was a child and Brant was ancient. He said\
  \ Brant was the sort of man who'd steal the coins from a beggar's bowl, even though\
  \ he was rich as Artokus of Thuvia. Brant couldn't remember the names of his own\
  \ grandchildren, but he had particular favorites among his <i>coins</i>.\"</p> \n\
  \   <p>\"Then it's time someone took a few of those coins off him. No sense letting\
  \ such precious things go to waste in a hole in the ground. The treasures he looted\
  \ were precious antiquities when he stole them, two hundred years ago. Imagine what\
  \ they're worth now!\" Rodrick paused, and when he spoke again, his voice was very\
  \ low, barely audible above the gentle lapping of water. \"Or you could <i>ask</i>\
  \ your father for the money to pay the Ratter the money you owe—\"</p> \n   <p>\"\
  Oh, yes, <i>that</i> would go over well,\" Simeon said dolefully. \"You know about\
  \ mother's gambling problem. If father found out <i>I'd</i> lost that much at Towers,\
  \ after he'd already spent all this money sending me here to recuperate... Is there\
  \ no other way? You couldn't loan me the money? You know I'm good for it.\"</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"Alas, I lost my own allowance gambling—though I paid off my outstanding\
  \ balance, so the Ratter doesn't want to take me in his jaws—and mother won't send\
  \ another purse for a month. No, it's the barrow, Simeon, unless you'd like to try\
  \ your luck at busking in the streets for coins?\"</p> \n   <p>\"You know someone\
  \ who would buy the things we found?\" Simeon said.</p> \n   <p>\"Oh, yes, indeed.\
  \ There's a man I know in Almas who pays buckets of gold for relics.\"</p> \n  \
  \ <p>\"We could at least <i>look</i>,\" Simeon said. \"The barrow isn't far, less\
  \ than a day's travel. We could nip inside, and if there don't seem to be any dangers,\
  \ carry a few things away. I daresay Uncle Brant can rest just as easily less a\
  \ vase or statuette or two.\"</p> \n   <p>\"An adventure!\" Rodrick said. \"Though\
  \ personally I hope we encounter a ghoul or two. I'd hate to think I sharpened my\
  \ sword for nothing.\"</p> \n   <p>They sat in silence for a while longer, taking\
  \ in the waters and discussing their plans for departure and the best route, then\
  \ left to walk down the dark and twisting tunnel back to the light.</p> \n   <p>Alaeron\
  \ let his little bag float away. Ah, well. The sacred waters weren't going anywhere.\
  \ He could steal a dram of those another time. But a barrow full of ancient relics,\
  \ that could be opened only by the blood of the dead inhabitant's relatives? That\
  \ was the sort of opportunity that wasn't likely to come his way again.</p> \n \
  \  <p></p>\n   <center>\n    ∗∗∗\n   </center>\n   <p></p> \n   <p> Alaeron wasn't\
  \ much of a tracker—his natural habitat was the laboratory, the workshop, and the\
  \ library, though he was surprisingly comfortable crawling into dark holes in the\
  \ ground in search of treasure, both because he was fascinated by history and because\
  \ a man had to fund his researches somehow. Fortunately, Simeon and Rodrick had\
  \ said where they were going. Alaeron packed his bags and left his room, which was\
  \ smaller than his sleeping quarters in Almas and cost as much for three nights\
  \ as his entire workshop was worth. Only the very rich would consider it reasonable\
  \ to pay so much for quarters so incredibly spare, presumably because austerity\
  \ (and magical waters) were good for the soul—but only in moderation. </p> \n  \
  \ <p>He walked along the crushed gravel paths, among the ancient weathered statues\
  \ and small ornamental gardens, to the outer courtyard. The retreat was protected\
  \ by high stone walls, because while they weren't <i>too</i> close to Darkmoon Vale,\
  \ incursions from the dark forest weren't impossible. </p> \n   <p>One of the servants\
  \ who bustled everywhere at the retreat brought him his horse, brushed and saddled\
  \ and well fed, and helped Alaeron mount. He needed the help. He'd never been comfortable\
  \ on horses, and would have hired a carriage (or at least a cart), but wheeled conveyances\
  \ couldn't make it up the steep paths to the retreat. Alaeron cajoled the horse,\
  \ a black pony he'd spent far too much money on, to amble northeast, through the\
  \ lightly wooded foothills. This general area was fairly safe—the guards at the\
  \ retreat kept the woods free of bandits and monsters, as rich people being eaten\
  \ was bad for business. The barrow of Brant Selmy was half a day's ride away, at\
  \ most, and Alaeron followed old colliers' paths through the forest, munching on\
  \ dried meat and pausing occasionally to let the horse rest, though the pace was\
  \ hardly punishing. </p> \n   <p>He didn't want to overtake Simeon and Rodrick.\
  \ Better for them to arrive first, open the barrow, and delve deep inside. Alaeron\
  \ was confident that, in the dark, with his experience and the advantage of his\
  \ extracts and mutagens, he could move past the rich brats, snatch up some choice\
  \ loot, and escape again unnoticed.</p> \n   <p>The barrow was unmistakable, an\
  \ immense mound of earth and rock furred with moss and topped by gnarled, scraggly\
  \ trees. Rodrick and Simeon had made some token attempt to hide their presence,\
  \ tying up their horses in a copse some distance away, but this was a little-traveled\
  \ part of the forest, and they hadn't worried overmuch about being discovered. Alaeron\
  \ tied his own horse farther away and crept toward one side of the barrow. He hadn't\
  \ expected this level of pillage when he'd set out for Balneal, and so hadn't packed\
  \ his full adventuring packs, but he had enough in the way of reagents and elixirs\
  \ and weapons to manage a brief delve into a crypt. </p> \n   <p>The door of the\
  \ barrow was an immense oval stone, scratched a bit from past unsuccessful attempts\
  \ by graverobbers to pry it open. The door was etched with runes that were faded\
  \ and worn but still legible, though a few were smeared with what looked like fresh\
  \ blood, and the stone was tilted to one side, revealing an opening just large enough\
  \ for a man to slip through sideways. Alaeron crouched when he heard familiar voices\
  \ inside.</p> \n   <p>\"It's <i>dark</i> in here,\" Simeon complained. </p> \n \
  \  <p>\"That's why we brought the lantern, isn't it?\" Rodrick answered cheerfully.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Despite Alaeron's leisurely pace, the rich fools had only just arrived\
  \ themselves. He was in awe at their slowness. Had they stopped to have a picnic\
  \ lunch on the way? He decided to wait for them to make it a bit deeper into the\
  \ barrow, then—</p> \n   <p>\"Watch out!\" Rodrick shouted. There was a peculiar\
  \ sound—the <i>twang</i> of a taut wire snapping, if Alaeron was any judge—and then\
  \ a horrific, meaty <i>thunk</i>, like a butcher bringing the weight of the cleaver\
  \ down to crack open a cow's skull.</p> \n   <p>Rodrick swore, which meant he was\
  \ still alive. Simeon didn't scream, which meant... something else. They'd triggered\
  \ a trap. Apparently Uncle Brant wasn't so keen on having his descendants visit\
  \ after all, or else Simeon hadn't been given the list of dangers to avoid. </p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"Simeon, you fool,\" Rodrick said. \"Why didn't you look where you were—\
  hold on. <i>Damn</i> it!\"</p> \n   <p>Alaeron tensed, expecting the sound of another\
  \ sprung trap—which would, at least, leave the barrow free for him to explore—but\
  \ instead Rodrick just let loose a torrent of cursing. Alaeron slipped inside, hoping\
  \ Rodrick would be too focused on his misery to notice the intrusion.</p> \n   <p>The\
  \ light of Rodrick's lantern, set on a shelf of rock, revealed the barrow's interior\
  \ to be typical of its kind: walls of timber and earth and stone, faintly rounded\
  \ roof too low for comfort. A second door stood across the small room, directly\
  \ opposite the exterior door, and that's where Simeon had met his fate: a length\
  \ of timber as thick around as a man's waist, studded with stone spikes, had been\
  \ hidden in a slot on the ceiling, doubtless connected to some tripwire in front\
  \ of that interior door. Simeon's approach had set off the trap, dropping the log\
  \ onto himself, and the result was a bit like what happened if you hit a tomato\
  \ with a hammer. Alaeron realized that he'd never seen the boy in one piece, having\
  \ only eavesdropped on him in the dark and from concealment. </p> \n   <p>Rodrick\
  \ was standing over—or, rather, <i>in</i>—his dead friend, peering at the interior\
  \ door. The surviving man was dressed in clothes too fine for dungeoneering, though\
  \ he'd put on a mail shirt, and had a sword at his hip. His boots looked sturdy,\
  \ at least. Alaeron couldn't see his face from here, but his shoulders were dismayingly\
  \ wide, and in general he had the kind of muscular and well-proportioned physique\
  \ the old poets called \"thews.\" </p> \n   <p>\"More runes,\" Rodrick muttered.\
  \ \"You died for nothing, Simeon—I can't even get <i>in</i>.\"</p> \n   <p>Well.\
  \ There was no sneaking past him and snatching up a few treasures unawares now.\
  \ Alaeron considered slinking away, but there was a barrow full of relics, with\
  \ nothing between him and the treasures but a stone etched with magical writing,\
  \ and he couldn't quite bring himself to leave.</p> \n   <p>He cleared his throat\
  \ instead. \"Excuse me,\" he said. \"I couldn't help overhearing your problem. I\
  \ think I can get the door open for you.\"</p> \n   <p>Rodrick rounded on him, sword\
  \ in his hand before Alaeron even saw him start to draw, and roared. </p> \n   <p><b>Coming\
