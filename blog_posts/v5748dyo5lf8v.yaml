  >Three figures to show off this week from the upcoming <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy909j\"\
  >Legends of Golarion</a> set of <a href=\"http://paizo.com/pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids\"\
  >Pathfinder Battles</a> prepainted plastic miniatures! This time I wanted to show\
  \ off some of the set's more... eeevil antagonists, in particular those associated\
  \ with my personal favorite nation of the Pathfinder world: CHELIAX! </span></p>\
  \ \n    <p>Yes, the great Empire of Cheliax, ruled by an aristocracy of devil-binding\
  \ loons and kept safe by the march of the highly regimented Hellknights. We've already\
  \ released one Hellknight in the <a href=\"http://paizo.com/pathfinder/adventurePath/skullAndShackles\"\
  >Skull &amp; Shackles</a> set, but for <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy909j\"\
  >Legends of Golarion</a> I wanted to juice up the faction with three new models.\
  \ </p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-HellknightScourge_360.jpeg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-HellknightScourge_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Here we have the Scourge Hellknight, based\
  \ on one of our very best Hellknight illustrations. This fine gentleman makes for\
  \ a great fully armored flail-focused fighter, or as the backbone of your Cheliax-faction\
  \ group of <a href=\"http://paizo.com/pathfinderSociety\">Pathfinder Society</a>\
  \ characters. The Order of the Scourge roots out crime all over Cheliax, and when\
  \ they sentence you to lashes, they're not talking about seductive blinking. This\
  \ Medium figure is slated at the uncommon rarity.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-HellknightSignifer_360.jpeg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-HellknightSignifer_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>While most Hellknights tend to be warriors\
  \ of various stripes, their many orders also feature large numbers of arcane spellcasters\
  \ ready to apply their unique talents to rooting out chaos in the empire. Here we\
  \ have a Hellknight Signifer pictured mid-casting, cleansing enemies of Cheliax\
  \ with a nerve-wracking spell. This figure has an amazing sense of flow and dimensionality\
  \ to it, and it really shines in hand. This Medium figure is at the uncommon rarity.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-ThruneAgent-Front_360.jpeg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-ThruneAgent-Front_180.jpeg\"\

  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-ThruneAgent-Back_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a> \n    </div> \n    <p>This Thrune Agent finishes off the Cheliax\
  \ trio in <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy909j\">Legends of Golarion</a>.\
  \ His heavy mace suggests that he might be a cleric, or at least a big fan of sickening\
  \ splatters of blood from the heads of his enemies. With the symbol of Cheliax imprinted\
  \ on his cloak, the Thrune Agent makes a good cleric of Asmodeus, the perfect companion\
  \ to a group of Hellknights literally out looking for trouble. The Thrune Agent,\
  \ a Medium figure, is slated at the uncommon rarity.</p> \n    <p>Last week I promised\
  \ to reveal something we didn't show off at Gen Con, and I'm sorry to say that illnesses\
  \ and preparation for PAX Prime (which kicked off today here in Seattle) got in\
  \ the way of taking more photographs of Legends of Golarion. A thousand apologies\
  \ for that. I'll make it up to you next week.</p> \n    <p>No, in fact, I think\
  \ I'll make it up to you right now with a SUPER EARLY SNEAK PEEK at one of my favorite\
  \ figures from the NEXT set, Wrath of the Righteous, which is currently scheduled\
  \ for a December release. Keep in mind that this is a production sculpt shot, so\
  \ some minor details may change, but I wanted you to see just how awesome this set\
  \ is going to be.</p> \n    <p>So join me in a visit to the future as I reveal some\
  \ shots of the demon lord Baphomet, designed by Wayne Reynolds and sculpted to perfection\
  \ by our partners at WizKids!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK-WrathRighteous-Baphomet2_360.jpeg\"\

  \ border=\"0\"></a> \n    </div> \n    <p>Look for more information on the Wrath\
  \ of the Righteous set next week, when I'll also finally get a chance to show off\
  \ some brand new <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy909j\">Legends of Golarion</a>\
  \ figures as well!</p> \n    <p>Until then, I remain...</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br>\
