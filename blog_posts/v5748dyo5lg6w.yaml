  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">by Lucien Soulban</p> \n   <h2>Chapter Two: Up the Creek</h2>\
  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">They\
  \ struck the raging sewer river hard, the cold lacerating them and the turbulence\
  \ spinning them around. The rushing water caught them in its torrent and Fife scrambled\
  \ for purchase. His fingers scrabbled slimy brick and then water, and then brick\
  \ again.</span></p> \n    <p>\"Darvin—\" he half-managed before he swallowed a foul\
  \ mouthful of their surroundings. The halfling coughed and tried to gasp down air,\
  \ but the waves closed around his head, his books and sodden wool dragging him down.\
  \ Fife reached up, panicked.</p> \n    <p>A hand grabbed his and pulled him up and\
  \ over rough wood.</p> \n    <p>Fife spent a few minutes coughing and waiting for\
  \ the pain in his shoulder to subside. He looked up at Darvin, who was wet and huddled\
  \ on the bench of the small boat that rocked at the end of a taut rope.</p> \n \
  \   <p>\"You're going to say I told you so,\" Fife said, unable to meet his brother's\
  \ gaze. </p> \n    <p>\"I... swallowed poo water,\" Darvin said.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Go ahead. Say it.\"</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-TideOfBlood-Fife2.jpg\"\

  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n     <br>Fife is never at a loss when striking a deal—making\
  \ good on it is another story.\n    </div> \n    <p>\"You made me swallow poo water.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"You pushed us in,\" Fife offered.</p> \n    <p>\"Nothing will ever\
  \ taste the same again.\"</p> \n    <p>\"The assassin!\" Fife suddenly looked around.\
  \ A shaft with iron rungs stretched above their heads, heavy runoff pouring down\
  \ from the hole. The tunnel itself was well past half-flooded, the curved ceiling\
  \ within reach. </p> \n    <p>\"I'll taste things,\" Darvin continued, his eyes\
  \ hollow and unblinking. \"Honeyed ham, ale, warm sourdough bread, salted beef,\
  \ sugar figs. And suddenly I'll remember that this tongue also tasted poo water.\
  \ And then the taste, <i>that taste</i>, will return. The taste,\" he whispered.\
  \ \"The taste...\"</p> \n    <p>\"Darvin! The assassin is up there!\"</p> \n   \
  \ <p>\"If he knew what I'd tasted...\"</p> \n    <p>\"You're annoyingly melodramatic.\"\
  \ Fife pulled his knife and cut the mooring rope. A knick from Fife's dagger was\
  \ all it took to unravel its taut braids. </p> \n    <p>The boat lurched and careened\
  \ down the sewer passage, jolting Darvin from his shock. \"Wh—what are you doing?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Committing us to a course.\" Fife grabbed one of the peeling gray\
  \ oars and handed the other to Darvin. \"Keep us off the walls.\"</p> \n    <p align=\"\
  center\">∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n    <p>Keeping them off the walls was easier said than done,\
  \ Darvin knew. The waters spun them around and sent their boat scrapping and thudding\
  \ against the tunnel's brick-lined flanks. Then the route ended at the junction\
  \ of another passageway with them hurtling toward the junction wall. </p> \n   \
  \ <p>Darvin screamed, \"Left or right?\" against the roar of the water. It wasn't\
  \ until he looked back and saw Fife's eyes go wide that he realized Fife didn't\
  \ know. </p> \n    <p>The joint of the passageways surged the water upward before\
  \ the merge, and both Darvin and Fife ducked as the ceiling rushed down to scrape\
  \ their heads. Then the torrent dipped into the new corridor with a lurching drop,\
  \ and Darvin fell off the bench as the rush twisted them to the side. The prow of\
  \ their boat slammed off the wall, a jarring crunch that splintered wood.</p> \n\
  \    <p>As Darvin righted himself, he heard, \"Uh oh.\"</p> \n    <p>\"‘Uh oh,'\
  \ what?\" Darvin screamed.</p> \n    <p>\"Nothing,\" Fife said, fighting with the\
  \ oar and doing his best to grin amiably.</p> \n    <p>\"‘Uh oh' is never nothing!\"\
  \ Darvin said. \"‘Uh oh' is code for run or duck or—\" and then he realized the\
  \ bottom of the boat had vanished under rising water. \"—or that! We're sinking?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"It's just a small crack,\" Fife said, pressing his naked foot against\
  \ the bloom sprouting in the bottom of the boat.</p> \n    <p>\"You know what you\
  \ call a bucket with a crack? Broken!\" </p> \n    <p>\"A bucket holds water in,\"\
  \ Fife said, his brows furrowed. \"A boat keeps water out. I don't think you're\
  \ making the point you were hoping to make.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Wall!\" Darvin shouted.\
  \ The boat surged on a swell and the two brothers pushed hard against the wall with\
  \ their paddles. The boat scraped the greenish brick, splintering jagged bits of\
  \ wood. More water spilled into their boat, but they managed to push off all the\
  \ same, the muscles in Darvin's shoulders screaming in exertion.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Oof!\" Fife said, sounding like the wind had been knocked out of him.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>Darvin looked back; Fife was no longer in the boat. </p> \n    <p>\"Fife—?\"\
  \ </p> \n    <p>Fife's oar was sticking out of the wall, the spade half buried between\
  \ the bricks, and Fife hung from it, his feet treading water. </p> \n    <p>\"How—\
  ?\" Darvin cried, and then saw. The oar was wedged in a large crack in the wall,\
  \ and Fife had accidently thrust it in when he tried to push them off. </p> \n \
  \   <p>Darvin scrambled to grab Fife, but it was a fool's notion. Too many yards\
  \ separated them, and the gap was increasing rapidly. They locked eyes, Fife's large\
  \ circles of panic mirroring the ‘O' of his mouth. </p> \n    <p>Darvin dove into\
  \ the water.</p> \n    <p align=\"center\">∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n    <p>Fife almost lost his\
  \ grip on the oar. Darvin had gone under and had yet to surface. \"Stupid,\" Fife\
  \ muttered, almost in tears, fighting to stay up. He'd wedged the oar into the wall\
  \ and it'd sheared him off as the boat slipped away. </p> \n    <p>\"Stupid!\" he\
  \ screamed at the tumult, desperately searching the rapids as the boat careened\
  \ and spun and slammed into a wall farther down. A moment later, it was gone, pulled\
  \ around the corner by the torrent. He was alone.</p> \n    <p>Fife's shoulders\
  \ hurt, his joints pulled by the weight of books. He had to let go, to swim downstream\
  \ and find Darvin. </p> \n    <p>A hand grabbed the brick wall, slipped on slime,\
  \ and grabbed again. A face emerged from the white surf: Darvin struggling to pull\
  \ himself forward brick by brick.</p> \n    <p>\"Grab my leg!\" Fife cried, pushing\
  \ his foot forward.</p> \n    <p>\"Grow longer legs!\" Darvin shouted back with\
  \ a grin, and was almost swallowed under.</p> \n    <p>\"Stupid!\" Fife shouted\
  \ again, but now it was with a fierce smile. \"Why'd you jump in?\"</p> \n    <p>Darvin\
  \ clawed forward another couple of feet, his fingers jammed into the groove between\
  \ bricks. \"You're welcome!\" he managed.</p> \n    <p>\"The boat had rope!\" Fife\
  \ shouted.</p> \n    <p>\"Did it?\" Darvin managed between gulps of air. \"Fancy\
  \ that.\"</p> \n    <p>Darvin was a few feet away now, a look of sheer determination\
  \ on his face as he pulled on bricks against the surge. Fife thrust his legs out\
  \ again despite the ache in his shoulders. Darvin pushed forward from the wall with\
  \ a desperate look and grabbed the cuff of Fife's trousers.</p> \n    <p>Fife wriggled,\
  \ his shoulders crying out at the sudden pull.</p> \n    <p>\"Stop bucking,\" Darvin\
  \ said, holding on to Fife's pants.</p> \n    <p>\"You're pulling my pants down,\"\
  \ Fife screeched. He was trying not to laugh, but he couldn't help it, the ridiculous\
  \ of the situation hitting home as his pants steadily lost their grip on his hips.\
  \ It was all too much, and Fife's fingers came undone at the same time his trousers\
  \ did. </p> \n    <p>A year passed, a moment, time irrelevant in the chaos, all\
  \ of it spent spinning, upturned, in the foul-tasting water. Hands grabbed for him,\
  \ pulling him up. A moment later, he was pulling Darvin up. They were each other's\
  \ ladder in the tumult.</p> \n    <p>\"Trying... to... save you!\" Darvin gasped.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Saving you!\" Fife retorted.</p> \n    <p>And down they both went again.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Fife wasn't sure when it happened. He didn't know who found the ledge\
  \ first, who pulled whom up, or if they both clambered up. The tunnel here was higher,\
  \ or maybe there was less water; the ledge was only an inch submerged. It hurt to\
  \ breathe. Darvin sucked in heavy gasps next to him.</p> \n    <p>\"How'd they...\
  \ send an assassin... after us... so quickly,\" Fife said between gulps of air.\
  \ He could still see the half-orc materialize out from the storm, throwing daggers.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"He was at the... inn. Likely spying on... <i>your</i> clients.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Our clients,\" Fife said. \"You're in this mess now.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  A detail I'll rectify later. I call it ‘flogging the halfling.'\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  I've heard that about you.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Pervert,\" Darvin said, giving his brother\
  \ the measure of a half push. </p> \n    <p>\"Besides, I'm already half-flogged,\"\
  \ Fife said after a moment. He managed to draw measured breath but still coughed\
  \ as the water pooled around them both.</p> \n    <p>\"You all right?\"</p> \n \
  \   <p>Fife nodded. \"You?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Have I mentioned? You made me taste\
  \ poo water.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Trust me, that part won't make it into the tales.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"What about the part where you lost your pants?\" Darvin asked.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Fife raised his head and looked down at his small clothes, his hairy\
  \ legs and large feet. He waggled his toes and groaned. \"Heroes are supposed to\
  \ wear pants.\" </p> \n    <p>\"My heroes work best without their pants,\" Darvin\
  \ replied, waggling his eyebrows obscenely.</p> \n    <p>Wet pants hit Fife in the\
  \ face before he could retort.</p> \n    <p>\"I held on to them,\" Darvin continued.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Fife nodded and slipped them on, freezing as they were, and looked around.\
  \ Better with them than without, he thought, despite the chill.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  You have no idea where we're going, do you?\" </p> \n    <p>\"I don't need to.\"\
  \ Fife pointed to where the water fled. \"The water flows to the knife gates. We\
  \ need to get them fully opened to flood the lowlands.\" </p> \n    <p>\"And why\
  \ isn't the city handling this problem?\" Darvin asked, getting up slowly.</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"They sent people down to clear the knife gates, including a wizard!\"\
  \ Fife said, checking his books. The water-resistant ink and candle-waxed pages\
  \ had protected the writing. \"The men never returned.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Excuse me?\"\
  \ Darvin said. \"Define ‘never returned'!\"</p> \n    <p>\"Um, you know?\" Fife\
  \ said, trying to look nonchalant in a manner that suggested he was completely chalant.\
  \ \"I thought I'd mentioned it.\"</p> \n    <p>\"You did no such thing!\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"Oh... fancy that.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Don't play coy. I saw you hesitate.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Well,\" Fife said, smiling up at his brother. \"I knew you'd overreact.\"\
  \ </p> \n    <p>Darvin motioned around them. \"Really! I wonder what would coax\
  \ such mortal terror from me?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Certainly not a fear of hyperbole.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"No, no, no,\" Darvin said, pointing. \"It's the terror of being\
  \ your brother!\"</p> \n    <p>\"See? Hyperbole. We're half-brothers at best.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"We're in the flooded sewers!\" Darvin said. \"Lost, cold, hunted\
  \ by an assassin, and whatever killed those men...\" He trailed off.</p> \n    <p>Fife\
  \ sighed deeply and pinched the bridge of his nose. \"Something is behind us, isn't\
  \ it?\"</p> \n    <p>Darvin nodded and backed away one step. </p> \n    <p>\"The\
  \ thing that killed the men?\"</p> \n    <p>Darvin took another step back. \"Things.\
  \ What do you fear other than spiders?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Gnomes,\" Fife admitted\
  \ softly. \"In fool's motley.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Good,\" Darvin said. \"This isn't\
  \ that.\"</p> \n    <p>Fife turned, knowing he'd regret it, and instantly at that.\
  \ He was right on both counts. </p> \n    <p>A wall of black bodies covered the\
  \ ledge not two dozen yards behind them. Wet fur in mangy tufts, diseased scabrous\
  \ skin in brown and black patches, thousands of red beady eyes, fist-sized bodies,\
  \ yellowed fangs bared. More disturbing still, the largest one measured the size\
  \ of a dog, with a long, wormlike, chewed and bitten tail. They made no sound, no\
  \ hint at motion, just watched. </p> \n    <p>\"Are those...?\" Fife whispered,\
  \ backing away.</p> \n    <p>\"Rats,\" Darvin said.</p> \n    <p>\"And the bigger\
  \ one?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Bigger rat.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I was wrong,\" Fife said, almost\
  \ apologetic. </p> \n    <p>The swarm of rats took a step forward. </p> \n    <p>\"\
  About coming here?\" </p> \n    <p>\"No,\" Fife said. \"Gnomes dressed in fool's\
  \ motley has now dropped to fourth-worst fear.\"</p> \n    <p>\"What was second,\
  \ then?\" Darvin asked.</p> \n    <p>\"Another time, perhaps? I don't want to give\
  \ the fates ideas.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Point. Shall we run?\"</p> \n    <p>Fife looked\
  \ down at his own hairy feet. \"Oh,\" he said in a hoarse whisper. \"I thought we\
  \ already were.\"</p> \n    <p>Fife and Darvin turned and ran in earnest. Behind\
  \ them, the sound of rushing water was drowned out by the new din of scrabbling\
  \ claws... </p> \n    <p align=\"center\"><b>Coming Next Week</b>: Desperate tactics\
