  \ presence. The journey of motherhood can mean very different things to different\
  \ people and can also be a very emotional time to many of us for so many different\
  \ reasons. This Mother’s Day, we recognize and thank the mothers; seen and unseen,\
  \ with children or without, who have blessed our community by being part of it.\
  \ We wish all of you a day of peace, joy, and love.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ through the house, gathering up clothes and traveling supplies and placing them\
  \ near her backpack. She retrieves a ragdoll from under the bed, looks at it a moment,\
  \ then tucks it near her child ensconced in the pile of quilts. Her partner adds\
  \ a packet of bread and cheese wrapped in waxed cloth to the pile near the pack,\
  \ then gives her a soft smile before turning back to the cooking area.</p> \n  \
  \    <p>“Do you want corn as well as beans dear?” her partner asks softly, careful\
  \ not to wake the sleeping child in the bed. Naptime is important and neither of\
  \ them want to confront the fury of an abruptly woken child.</p> \n      <p>“If\
  \ we’ve some ground corn, I would take that, but do not want the weight of a quern\
  \ in my pack and am unsure if I will find mills on my journey.”</p> \n      <p>The\
  \ partner checks the crock of ground corn, then empties it into an empty small sack\
  \ and places the first sack into a second. “There was plenty of ground corn for\
  \ you to take. I’ve put it in two bags to keep it from spilling through the loose\
  \ weave of the bag.”</p> \n      <p>They continue in this manner for some minutes,\
  \ then stop and look at each other.</p> \n      <p>“I’ll miss you,” she says.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>“As much as I’ll miss you,” her partner replies. They embrace, taking\
  \ time to breath deep within the circle of each other’s arms. “Stay safe and come\
  \ back to us when you’ve finished your tasks. We will be here waiting.” Her partner\
  \ leans forward, placing a gentle kiss on her forehead. “That is from me.” Another\
  \ kiss. “That is from our child.” </p> \n      <p>She hugs her partner tight, squeezing\
  \ firmly, for a few more heartbeats, then opens her arms. She returns to packing,\
  \ moving faster and more determined. Nodding at the stack of assembled items, she\
  \ turns to her partner. “I’d like to take your tan sweater, if you don’t mind. It\
  \ will keep you close as I complete my tasks.” </p> \n      <p>“Of course, but I’\
  m wearing your blue one while you are gone!”</p> \n      <p>She grins. “I would\
  \ expect no less.”</p> \n      <p>They finish packing, checking the weight and balance\
  \ of the pack. At last, all preparations are done and they sit to have a cup of\
  \ tea and wait for the small being to wake. It doesn’t take long, as if the child\
  \ senses the lack of activity in the home.</p> \n      <p>“Mom!” The child cries\
  \ abruptly, before sitting up and blinking as they orientate themselves to their\
  \ location. They hop out of bed and runs to where the adults are sitting. After\
  \ a few minutes of cuddling between the trio, the child wiggles free.</p> \n   \
  \   <p>Her partner bustles about, pouring some berries from a basket on a shelf\
  \ onto a wooden plate and adding a slice of bread, slathering it with butter and\
  \ dripping honey over the surface. They place the plate in front of the child, who\
  \ greedily starts munching the snack.</p> \n      <p>“It’s time.” She looks to her\
  \ partner, who nods in agreement.</p> \n      <p>“It is.”</p> \n      <p>“I love\
  \ you both,” she exclaims as she plants a kiss on the top of the child’s head, then\
  \ kneels in front of the child. “I have to go for a few days. I should return before\
  \ the next moon cycle. You stay safe until I get back.”</p> \n      <p>The child\
  \ nods and continues eating, attention focused on the consumption of food.</p> \n\
  \      <p>She sighs softly. “The others are probably waiting. Best go now.”</p>\
  \ \n      <p>“Find what is harming the herds, slay the beast, then come back to\
  \ us.” Her partner gives her one quick hug, then crosses the room and opens the\
  \ door.</p> \n      <p>“As fast as I can safely do so.” She picks up the pack and\
  \ slings its straps over her shoulders. Then she reaches for the sword suspended\
  \ from a belt on the peg near the door. She buckles it on as she takes one last\
  \ look around the room, then kisses her partner gently on the lips and strides through\
  \ the door.</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>To all mothers in our greater community,\
  \ we thank you for enriching our community with your presence. May you have good\
  \ times gaming with friends and family, a relaxing day, and a wonderful year. </p>\
