  \ Operations Manual</em> is coming on July 30, but you don’t have to wait until\
  \ then to start playing with the amazing new toys it provides for Game Masters!\
  \ Here’s an encounter that uses just a few of the new ships, weapons, hazards, and\
  \ rules found in the book, designed by Starfinder Developer Jason Tondro. All the\
  \ rules you need have been summarized below, so you can play this encounter right\
  \ away, even if you don’t have the Starship Operations Manual.</p> \n      <p style=\"\

  \      <h3>A SINGULAR NOTION — CR VARIES</h3> \n      <p>This encounter is Average\
  \ difficulty for a group of PCs flying a tier-8 starship, but your PCs may be higher\
  \ or lower in level. A Singular Notion is an Easy encounter for 9th-level PCs, Challenging\
  \ for 7th-level PCs, Hard for 6th-level PCs, and Epic for 5th-level PCs.</p> \n\
  \      <p>The player characters are traveling through the Drift when they receive\
  \ a distress signal.</p> \n      <blockquote>\n       <p>“This is an emergency transmission\
  \ from the Steward vessel <em>Harrowstone</em>. We have been attacked by kasathan\
  \ pirates and have sustained serious damage. Our power core has been destroyed and\
  \ our thrusters are non-functional. We are in need of assistance. Please, if you\
  \ can hear us, this is the Steward vessel <em>Harrowstone</em>...”</p>\n      </blockquote>\
  \ \n      <p>The <em>Harrowstone</em> can be detected on sensors; it is a Large\
  \ freighter outfitted as a prisoner transport. It has indeed lost all power and\
  \ is floating helpless in the Drift amid clouds of time-eaters, a bizarre hazard\
  \ unique to the Drift (see below). Player Characters who communicate with the ship\
  \ will be answered by Third Officer <b>Daneel Ris</b> (LG female human), who is\
  \ doing her best in a very difficult situation. “If you can rendezvous with us,”\
  \ she says, “our modular passenger section can disconnect from the ship and attach\
  \ to your vessel. You mind giving us a ride home?” A PC suspicious of officer Ris\
  \ and who succeeds at a DC 22 Sense Motive check can tell she’s hiding something.\
  \ If pressed, Ris admits, “We have a very high-profile prisoner on board, a kasathan\
  \ cult leader who calls himself Singulos. I think the attack might have been an\
  \ attempt at a jailbreak, I don’t know.”</p> \n      <p>If the PCs agree to help\
  \ the <em>Harrowstone</em>, place the prison ship in the middle of a starship combat\
  \ map and place the PC starship along a short edge. The few remaining Stewards aboard\
  \ the <em>Harrowstone</em> have already separated the passenger section from the\
  \ rest of the ship and stand ready with a docking clamp to attach to the PC starship.</p>\
  \ \n      <p><b>Hazard</b>: This region of the Drift is infested with time-eaters,\
  \ who have gathered together into massive colonies known as ganglions. Time-eater\
  \ ganglions and many other space hazards are detailed on pages 134-137 of the <em>Starfinder\
  \ Starship Operations Manual</em>, but the rules for time-eater ganglions are briefly\
  \ summarized here. </p> \n      <p>Place 6 time-eater ganglions on the map, each\
  \ occupying 1-3 hexes. They move toward the nearest starship 3 hexes every round\
  \ at the start of the Helm phase. A ganglion that ends its movement next to a starship,\
  \ or when it shares its space with one, tries to grab it; the pilot can avoid this\
  \ with a successful Piloting check (DC = 15 + 1-1/2 x the starship’s tier). Starships\
  \ grasped by the ganglion lose shields in a random quadrant; if that quadrant’s\
  \ shields were already depleted, the ganglion consumes the ship’s time energy, reducing\
  \ the ship’s speed by 2 for 1d4 rounds. For the duration of this effect, the ganglion\
  \ moves 1 additional hex. This effect is cumulative, to a minimum starship speed\
  \ of 0 and a maximum ganglion speed of 10 hexes, and the duration is refreshed each\
  \ time a ganglion grabs the starship. A ganglion can be targeted by starship weapons\
  \ and has an AC and TL of 15. If a ganglion takes a total of 20 damage per hex it\
  \ occupies, it breaks apart into individual time eaters, harmless to starships.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Third Officer Ris urges the PCs to hurry, saying, “That kasathan ship\
  \ could be back any minute!” If the PC starship reaches the <em>Harrowstone</em>,\
  \ the crew aboard it attach their drifting section of the ship to the PC starship\
  \ at the beginning of the next Engineering Phase. </p> \n      <p><b>Starship Combat</b>:\
  \ On the third round or as soon as the Harrowstone’s passenger section attaches\
  \ to the PC starship (whichever comes first), another starship enters from a long\
  \ edge of the map. “Look out!” Ris says over the comm, “that’s the same ship that\
  \ attacked us before! They must have repaired whatever damage we were able to do.”\
  </p> \n      <p>The new arrival is the <em>Aphelion</em>, an Idaran Thunderbolt\
  \ crewed not by kasathan pirates, but by solarians intent on the rescue of their\
  \ cult leader, Singulos. The Thunderbolt is a small but advanced kasathan design\
  \ specialized for boarding enemy starships. The Thunderbolt is detailed on page\
  \ 95 of the <em>Starfinder Starship Operations Manual</em>; its statistics are duplicated\
  \ below and its special abilities summarized, but for full details see the <em>Starship\
  \ Operations Manual</em>.</p> \n      <p>In battle, the <em>Aphelion</em> fights\
  \ the PC starship while launching its breaching pod at the Harrowstone’s passenger\
  \ section, attached to the PC vessel. The passenger section has an AC and TL equal\
  \ to 15 + the Pilot ranks of the pilot aboard the PC starship; it has no shields.\
  \ If the PC starship is grabbed by time-eater ganglions, the <em>Aphelion</em> maneuvers\
  \ to take advantage of this, attacking through a lost shield.</p> \n      <p>A PC\
  \ Engineer can attempt to extend the ship’s shields over the <em>Harrowstone’s</em>\
  \ passenger section, protecting it from attacks. This requires a successful Engineering\
  \ check (DC = 15 + 1-1/2 the tier of the PC starship) and reduces the PC starship’\
  s shields by half. As long as the PC starship has shield points remaining in a given\
  \ quadrant, the <em>Aphelion’s</em> breaching pod cannot hit; a lost shield, however,\
  \ leaves the <em>Harrowstone’s</em> passenger section vulnerable in that quadrant.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>If the <em>Aphelion</em> cannot land its breaching pod on the <em>Harrowstone’\
  s</em> passenger section, it attempts to ram, boarding on a successful hit. The\
  \ <em>Aphelion</em> has a boarding party of 16 individuals, carried in the ship’\
  s passenger seating, but only 8 fit in a breaching pod.</p> \n      <div class=\"\

  \ \n      <hr> \n      <p><b>Breaching Pod</b> The <em>Aphelion</em> can fire its\
  \ breaching pod as a seeking weapon. It can only hit a target if the shield in that\
  \ quadrant has already been lost. If it does hit, the boarding party within the\
  \ pod boards the PC vessel. If it does not hit, it drifts in space and can be recovered\
  \ by the <em>Aphelion</em> after combat is over.</p> \n      <p><b>Ramming</b> The\
  \ <em>Aphelion’s</em> pilot can attempt to ram during the Helm phase, as a stunt.\
  \ This requires a successful DC 24 Piloting check. The Aphelion’s Turn increases\
  \ by 2, but the ship can enter the same space as the PC starship and attack the\
  \ <em>Harrowstone’s</em> passenger section with its ramming prow, requiring a gunnery\
  \ check against AC. On a hit, the <em>Aphelion</em> deals no damage to the PC starship,\
  \ but it takes 4d4 damage to its front quadrant, ends its movement, and can board\
  \ the <em>Harrowstone’s</em> passenger section. If the PC starship is Medium or\
  \ smaller, it moves 1 hex in the direction the Aphelion is facing; if the PC starship\
  \ is Large or larger, the <em>Aphelion</em> moves back 1 hex and is still facing\
  \ the target.</p> \n      <p><b>Development</b>: If the crew of the <em>Aphelion</em>\
  \ successfully board the <em>Harrowstone’s</em> passenger section, looking for their\
  \ leader Singulos, move to the tactical encounter “Escaping Gravity” (appearing\
  \ on the Paizo Blog next week).</p> \n      <p><b>XP</b>: Use the table on page\
  \ 390 of the <em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em> to determine the appropriate XP for\
  \ this encounter, based on the encounter’s difficulty.</p> \n     </blockquote>\
