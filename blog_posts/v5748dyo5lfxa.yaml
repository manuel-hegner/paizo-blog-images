  >The hill giant stepped over the smashed remains of the trees. It wore a vest and\
  \ skirt made of filthy hides, and a necklace of raccoon skulls dangled between its\
  \ two drooping and half-covered breasts. Its hair hung in clumpy strands the color\
  \ of dirt, damp and clinging to its jowled cheeks.</span></p> \n    <p>A dozen of\
  \ the canvas and wood tent cabins stood between Jendara and the giant, and two men\
  \ raced out of one of the structures, loaded up with gear and screaming. One of\
  \ them shoved Jendara aside and barreled down the hill. Jendara ignored the other.\
  \ Off to her right, Grotnir ran with Nola, headed toward the end of camp where the\
  \ mule screams were coming from. She couldn't see his horse anywhere.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>The giant bellowed something in its ugly language and swung a tree limb at\
  \ the nearest tent cabin. The structure crumpled on impact.</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n     <br>What hill giants lack in intelligence, they make up\
  \ for in brute strength.\n    </div> \n    <p>Jendara unslung her bow and narrowed\
  \ her eyes. A giant. She had only seen one once: While traveling on the mainland\
  \ with her father, they'd seen one attack a shepherd and his flock. Her father had\
  \ driven the giant away with only a hunting spear and a handaxe. Jendara had been\
  \ maybe six or seven, but she'd never forgotten the ugly, stinking mass of the thing,\
  \ or the pain that filled the shepherd's eyes as he struggled to breathe with lungs\
  \ and ribs crushed by the creature. That shepherd was the first man she had watched\
  \ die.</p> \n    <p>The giant wrenched a broken tree trunk from the ground and flung\
  \ it. Jendara threw herself aside. The log crashed down in the logging road, just\
  \ inches from where she'd been standing.</p> \n    <p>She felt the hot stirring\
  \ of anger in her chest. She growled and readied her bow again.</p> \n    <p>She\
  \ let fly her arrow. It sank fletching deep in the giant's floppy dug, and the creature\
  \ shrieked. Then the giant ripped the arrow free and cast it aside. Jendara reached\
  \ for another. She had to choose a better target—the creature's torso was just too\
  \ fat for her arrows to hit a major organ.</p> \n    <p>The ground rumbled beneath\
  \ her feet. A herd of mules thundered down the hill, straight toward Jendara.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>A hand closed on her arm and she flew up in the air, her bow clattering\
  \ to the ground. </p> \n    <p>\"Get on!\" Lugh bellowed. She scrabbled for a grip\
  \ on the saddle and managed to get onto the horse's back even as it bolted away\
  \ from the stampeding mules, racing leftward up a switchback Jendara hadn't noticed\
  \ before. </p> \n    <p>Lugh slowed the horse. A couple of good-sized hemlocks stood\
  \ between them and the camp, but Jendara could still hear the giant's laughter,\
  \ low and rumbling and ugly. She sat up straight in the saddle. The black horse\
  \ tossed its head, and she recognized it as Irlu's.</p> \n    <p>\"We've got to\
  \ stop this thing before it brings down the whole camp. Do you know where Irlu is?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Lugh patted the horse's neck. \"I saw her bringing wounded out of\
  \ the biggest tent—must have been the folks the wolf hurt when it came through camp.\
  \ Want to bet the giant and the wolf are working together?\"</p> \n    <p>\"I'll\
  \ keep my money, thank you.\"</p> \n    <p>Lugh only laughed and urged the horse\
  \ back toward the camp. Jendara gripped Lugh's shoulder tight with her left hand\
  \ and drew her sword with the other. The giant stood in the middle of camp, fallen\
  \ and shattered tent cabins all around it. The horse leaped over a toppled tree.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Then it suddenly reared up, hooves flailing. Something white burst up\
  \ out of a fallen tent, snarling and roaring. The horse screamed as frost covered\
  \ its hooves and coated its front legs. Jendara lost her grip on Lugh's shoulder\
  \ and slid off the horse's back. She had the presence of mind to roll to her right,\
  \ but she hit the ground hard. She pushed herself to sit up. Her ribs hurt, and\
  \ her sword had fallen someplace. She felt naked without it. </p> \n    <p>The horse\
  \ dropped to all fours and spun around. The white wolf lunged forward, but the horse\
  \ lashed out with a rear leg and clipped the wolf in the muzzle. The creature toppled\
  \ backward, but caught itself and shook its shaggy white head. Its glacial blue\
  \ eyes fixed on the horse.</p> \n    <p>Jendara's sword lay just inches from the\
  \ big white wolf. She eyed the distance between the creature and the sword. There\
  \ was no way she could grab it and attack before the beast saw her.</p> \n    <p>A\
  \ splintered door smashed down in front of her. She kicked the broken slab of wood\
  \ away and jumped to her feet, but the wolf was gone. </p> \n    <p>Jendara ran\
  \ to grab her sword. \"Where is it?\" she shouted. \"Lugh, do you see the wolf?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>He stroked the horse's neck. It was calm now that the wolf had vanished.\
  \ \"I'm more worried about the giant.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Forget the giant,\" Grotnir\
  \ growled, appearing at Jendara's elbow. \"Irlu and I have gotten most of the injured\
  \ onto a logging skid. Let's grab the last of them and get these people down to\
  \ Big Cascade before anyone else is hurt.\" </p> \n    <p>\"What about the mules?\"\
  \ Jendara shouted, remembering the stampede. She sheathed her sword.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Nola's rounding them up!\" Grotnir beckoned her toward the biggest of the tent cabins.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Before she could move, part of the big tent's wooden frame collapsed.\
  \ Flames whooshed suddenly up the back wall. The giant stumbled backward, shielding\
  \ its face from the heat.</p> \n    <p>\"Irlu!\" Grotnir grabbed Jendara's arm.\
  \ \"She's in there!\"</p> \n    <p>They ran into the smoky haze. On this side of\
  \ the tent, the doorframe still stood, but black smoke billowed out the open door.\
  \ Jendara covered her mouth and nose with her shirt. A deep whump shook the wall,\
  \ and another section collapsed.</p> \n    <p>Jendara grabbed the back of Grotnir's\
  \ cloak. \"You can't go in there!\"</p> \n    <p>He tried to shake her off. \"I've\
  \ got to get her out!\"</p> \n    <p>Flames lapped across the sagging tent roof.\
  \ Jendara threw her arms around Grotnir and heaved him away from the doorway. He\
  \ wrenched at her fingers, but she stuck fast.</p> \n    <p>A hunched figure burst\
  \ out of the doorway, enshrouded in smoldering wool. </p> \n    <p>\"Irlu!\" Grotnir\
  \ shouted.</p> \n    <p>Irlu threw herself on the ground, rolling hard to smother\
  \ any flames. She sat up and coughed hard, fighting for air. Jendara and Grotnir\
  \ hurried to help her to her feet and away from the flaming tent.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  We've got to get out of here,\" Jendara warned Grotnir. \"Where's the logging skid?\"\
  \ She couldn't see a thing. Her eyes stung with the black smoke choking the air.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"The road,\" he grunted. They staggered forward until their boots squelched\
  \ in the road's deep mud.</p> \n    <p>Irlu sagged against Grotnir's side for a\
  \ second, sucking up air. \"A barrel of cooking oil,\" she croaked. \"Exploded.\
  \ I tried to get to the last man, but there were flames everywhere.\"</p> \n   \
  \ <p>\"Don't talk,\" Grotnir said. \"You've breathed a lot of smoke.\"</p> \n  \
  \  <p>Jendara blinked around herself. There was no sign of Lugh or Irlu's horse—\
  and no sign of the logging skid, either. \"I don't see Nola or the skid.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>A black horse burst out of the smoke, riderless. Jendara's stomach sank.\
  \ \"Where's Lugh?\"</p> \n    <p>A gust of wind stirred the smoke, and Jendara caught\
  \ a glimpse of white at the edge of camp. She ran toward it. She could make out\
  \ a voice—a rough, horrible voice, speaking a language she couldn't understand.\
  \ The consonants clacked like rocks tumbling together, but the voice wasn't a giant's\
  \ deep boom. She remembered what Grotnir had said about the wolves speaking.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The smoke eddied around Jendara, obscuring the world around her. She\
  \ stumbled and fell into the mud, then pushed herself up to her hands and knees\
  \ and looked back at what had tripped her: the still figure of a dark-haired woman\
  \ in a brown coat, her cheek pink and blistered. </p> \n    <p>Nola. She'd come\
  \ back to help her friends, and now she lay here in the mud.</p> \n    <p>The skull-and-crossbones\
  \ tattoos on the backs of Jendara's hands—symbols of the pirate goddess she'd once\
  \ revered—burned with rage. She reached for the axe in her belt. That wolf was going\
  \ to pay. The giant may have crushed the camp, but the white wolf had to be the\
  \ brains behind the attack.</p> \n    <p>Snarling, she jumped to her feet and ran\
  \ toward the sound of the wolf's voice. The wall of smoke dissipated and she saw\
  \ the white shape again, now moving into the dark forest beyond a broken corral,\
  \ the giant close behind. The wolf turned to look at her. Its lip curled.</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"Tell the Blackravens I took their partner.\" The creature made a noise\
  \ in the back of its throat that might have been a laugh. \"If they want him, they'll\
  \ have to find him.\"</p> \n    <p>The giant's sides jiggled in merriment. It raised\
  \ one hand and wiggled the fingers in a mocking wave. The other hand rested on Lugh's\
  \ back, bent over the giantess's shoulder. His body was limp.</p> \n    <p>\"Give\
  \ him to me!\" Jendara bellowed.</p> \n    <p>The wolf smiled broader. \"Don't forget\
  \ the message.\" It slipped into the trees without another sound.</p> \n    <p>Jendara\
  \ ran forward—straight into the sudden swing of the giant's club. She managed to\
  \ sidestep the full force of the blow, but it still caught her on the edge of her\
  \ ribcage, spinning her around. She crumpled into the mud, her vision gray and bleary.\
  \ She tried to sit up and saw a dazzling constellation of stars.</p> \n    <p>Someone\
  \ knelt beside her and touched her shoulder. \"Jendara?\" Irlu's voice was raspy\
  \ with smoke.</p> \n    <p>Anger pushed the pain out of Jendara's head. She sat\
  \ up. \"It thinks Lugh is one of you. A Blackraven. It wants you to come after him.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Grotnir squatted to meet Irlu's eyes. \"So that's what this is about.\
  \ It's the wolf the last patrol didn't finish.\"</p> \n    <p>\"They wrecked this\
  \ whole camp just to draw us in,\" Irlu growled. </p> \n    <p>\"Fine.\" Grotnir\
  \ spat on the ground. \"If it wants Blackravens, we'll give it Blackravens..\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Jendara grabed his shoulder and pulled herself up. She felt terrible.\
  \ Her head hurt, and her ribs screamed from the double insult of the giant's club\
  \ and the fall from the horse. But at least she could think clearly. \"This is a\
  \ trap.\"</p> \n    <p>Irlu swiped soot from her face. \"Of course it is. But I'll\
  \ be serving on patrol with Caul for a whole year. Am I supposed to look him in\
  \ the eye and say I let his brother get kidnapped by a white wolf and didn't go\
  \ after him?\"</p> \n    <p>Jendara nodded, then regretted the motion. \"I'm going\
  \ with you.\"</p> \n    <p>Grotnir's fist closed on her shoulder. \"You're a brave\
  \ one, but you're no Blackraven. Go down to Big Cascade and warn the townsfolk.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>She knocked his hand away. \"I promised Lugh's father I'd take care\
  \ of him. I can't turn my back on him now.\"</p> \n    <p>Grotnir's lips pursed,\
  \ but at last he nodded.</p> \n    <p>\"Besides,\" Jendara added. \"That wolf tried\
  \ to turn me into a messenger girl.\" She grinned. \"I'm going to teach it a lesson.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Irlu stood and moved toward the forest. \"If you two are coming, then\
  \ hurry up.\" Then she slipped into the trees as silently as the white wolf had.\
  \ </p> \n    <p>Jendara had to admire the dark-haired tracker. The white wolf had\
  \ killed two of her fellow border guards. Irlu was injured and didn't even know\
  \ Lugh. But she hadn't hesitated to go after him.</p> \n    <p>Jendara tapped the\
  \ handle of her belt axe. It had been her father's, once; he had used it to fight\
  \ off that giant. If his spirit could see her holding it now, he would certainly\
  \ approve. </p> \n    <p>Jendara followed Irlu into the forest. That wolf had no\
  \ idea who it was dealing with.</p> \n    <p align=\"center\"><b>Want more Jendara?<br>\
