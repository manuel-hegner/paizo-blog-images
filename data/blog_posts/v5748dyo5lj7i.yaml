  >Last week, I started running down my favorite new additions to the <a href=\"/products/btpy9nme\"\
  >hardcover edition of Curse of the Crimson Throne</a>—and this week I'll be doing\
  \ more of the same! This time, I look at some of my favorite new additions to the\
  \ campaign that appear in the final two chapters of the Adventure Path, as well\
  \ as explore the contents of the extensive appendix that rounds out the book.</p>\
  \ \n     <div style=\"margin: 10px 0;\">\n      <b>Chapter 5: Skeletons of Scarwall</b>\
  \ \n      <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"spoilerButton\" onclick=\"\
  toggleSpoiler(this)\">\n      <div class=\"spoiler-text\"> \n       <h2>Filling\
  \ Up Scarwall</h2> \n       <p>Scarwally is one of the largest dungeon crawls to\
  \ ever appear in a Pathfinder Adventure Path. So large, in fact, that in its original\
  \ incarnation I ended up having to cut several encounters and replace them with\
  \ generic and uninteresting storerooms and kitchens and the like. When I started\
  \ developing the text for the hardcover version, I went back to Greg's original\
  \ turnover and found all sorts of old encounters that got cut for space. And so\
  \ of COURSE I put them back in! Now, the saga of the undead orc chieftain Ukwar\
  \ is there for your PCs to unravel, along with several other restored encounters.\
  \ But even putting all of those encounters back in didn't do the trick; there were\
  \ still empty rooms! And so I made up several brand-new encounters to spice things\
  \ up even more, including a new category of haunt called a phantasm. I'm eager to\
  \ see how folks react to phantasms, since they exist primarily to both fill in backstory\
  \ and provide hints to solve the castle haunting, but also to mess with the players\
  \ themselves, so they never no exactly what's going on. Phantasms generally ask\
  \ that the GM have a specific player roll a skill check or saving throw or other\
  \ die roll, but then advice the GM to make a show of noting the result without saying\
  \ why. Other phantasms cause a PC to experience a vision that other PCs don't, but\
  \ suggest the GM impart this information individual to players so the players themselves\
  \ don't have the benefit of knowing the full picture of what's going on. It's a\
  \ pretty meta way to handle haunts, and should help to infuse Scarwall with a sense\
  \ of dread that will put even the most hardened players on edge.</p> \n       <p>As\
  \ an example, here's a sample phantasm taken directly from the text:</p> \n    \
  \   <blockquote> \n        <p><b>Phantasm</b>: The first PC who moves to investigate\
  \ the strip of cloth must attempt a Will save. When you know the result, write it\
  \ down and tell the player (regardless of the result) that his character feels a\
  \ sudden panic at being caught in the arrow slit while trying to escape a murderous\
  \ orc that's right behind him! Of course, there is no orc, and the Will save has\
  \ no significance beyond being an attempt to unsettle the players.</p> \n      \
  \ </blockquote> \n       <p>(This particular phantasm is a haunt left behind by\
  \ a castle servant who was indeed chased by an orc; when the servant tried to escape\
  \ by squeezing throw an arrow slit, he got stuck and then murdered by the orc. In\
  \ this way, the phantasm gives the players a brief glimpse into one of the numerous\
  \ atrocities that occurred in Scarwall in the past, but also tinkers with their\
  \ sense of safety and comfort by having a player roll a Will save that has no obvious\
  \ immediate result.)</p> \n       <p>As noted early in the chapter, not all tables\
  \ will be entertained by phantasms, and in fact I suspect some players will be more\
  \ frustrated than entertained by them—and as such, you should feel free to omit\
  \ them from your game if you see players reacting with frustration at their inclusion.\
  \ They're meant to add to Scarwall's overall sense of haunting menace, but removing\
  \ them won't cripple the plot at all.</p> \n      </div>\n     </div> \n     <div\

  >\n      <div class=\"spoiler-text\"> \n       <h2>Bolstering the Opposition</h2>\
  \ \n       <p>Unlike Castle Scarwall, Castle Korvosa was fully detailed in its original\
  \ publication. It helped, of course, that Castle Korvosa wasn't intended to be a\
  \ hyper-detailed dungeon crawl, but an active and occupied castle meant for several\
  \ swift strikes rather than meticulous exploration. There's not a lot of new content\
  \ in Castle Korvosa, as a result, but in the last part of the adventure I did add\
  \ a few brand new encounters, both to mix things up a bit and to give Queen Ileosa\
  \ more allies to call upon if things go bad. Among these additional threats in the\
  \ Sunken Queen are two entities that have eldritch links to Runelord Sorshen—a scarlet\
  \ walker (an extraplanar menace first detailed in the Anniversary Edition of Rise\
  \ of the Runelords) and an immortal ichor that formed not from a god's blood but\
  \ of seepage from the Everdawn Pool. And of course, there's one more monster at\
  \ Ileosa's side in the final encounter!</p> \n      </div>\n     </div> \n     <div\
  \ style=\"margin: 10px 0;\">\n      <b>Appendix</b> \n      <input type=\"button\"\
  \ value=\"Show\" class=\"spoilerButton\" onclick=\"toggleSpoiler(this)\">\n    \
  \  <div class=\"spoiler-text\"> \n       <p>We've seven appendices in this book,\
  \ each of which is intended to help the GM run her Crimson Throne game, or to expand\
  \ it beyond the scope of the adventures as written.</p> \n       <h2>Appendix 1:\
  \ Continuing the Campaign</h2> \n       <p>This short appendix suggests seven additional\
  \ plots that can be expanded by you, the GM, to continue your Crimson Throne game,\
  \ including one variant that sees Ileosa come back as a vampire! (And yes, of course\
  \ we gave you art of vampire Ileosa!)</p> \n       <h2>Appendix 2: Korvosa and Beyond</h2>\
  \ \n       <p>The adventures themselves present all the information about Korvosa\
  \ you'll need to run encounters key to Crimson Throne's plot, but as in any urban\
  \ game, your PCs will wander. This appendix presents a detailed gazetteer of Korvosa\
  \ as it exists under Ileosa's rule, and serves as an expansion to the original Guide\
  \ to Korvosa we published long ago. While owning that book will certainly help you\
  \ run a Crimson Throne campaign, I strived to include enough information in this\
  \ appendix that it's not necessary. In addition to all sorts of adventure hooks\
  \ and location descriptions for the city, this appendix presents multiple city stat\
  \ blocks for Korvosa as it undergoes numerous changes during the course of the campaign\
  \ (from a healthy city to one on the edge of anarchy to one in the grips of a plague\
  \ to one under martial law). Nearly three pages of rumor tables will help you drop\
  \ hints to your players to foreshadow upcoming events, and advice on places where\
  \ the PCs can rest and recuperate, shop for magic, or secure spellcasting services\
  \ rounds the appendix out, along with some additional notes on the surrounding lands\
  \ (including the Cinderlands themselves).</p> \n       <h2>Appendix 3: The Harrow</h2>\
  \ \n       <p>The Harrow has always held a powerful role in Curse of the Crimson\
  \ Throne, and this appendix not only provides you advice on how to use Harrow readings\
  \ in your game and a mechanic for the PCs to use those harrow readings to influence\
  \ fate, but also includes a list of what every single card in the Harrow deck symbolizes\
  \ in the context of Curse of the Crimson Throne, so that when you pull a card during\
  \ a reading, you'll know precisely what that card means for the PCs and their destiny.</p>\
  \ \n       <h2>Appendix 4: Blood and Pain</h2> \n       <p>This short chapter is\
  \ a sort of catch-all—here you've got rules for the plague that wracks Korvosa,\
  \ but also rules for a kyton eidolon subtype. Why the subtype? Well, in the original\
  \ version of the Adventure Path, we had an NPC named Shadowcount Sial, who had levels\
  \ in a prestige class called \"thaumaturgist\"—a class that allowed a character\
  \ to gain the services of an extraplanar minion. This prestige class, alas, was\
  \ not one we updated into the Pathfinder rules, and while I initially toyed with\
  \ doing so in this book, I settled on something better. I translated Shadowcount\
  \ Sial into an unchained summoner, which gave me the perfect opportunity to give\
  \ rules for kyton eidolons—something that there was no room to include in Pathfinder\
  \ Unchained but which I know many folks have been asking for!</p> \n       <h2>Appendix\
  \ 5: Equipment and Magic</h2> \n       <p>There's a few new items of equipment and\
  \ many more new magic items to be found in this campaign—and they're all presented\
  \ in this appendix. While some of these are updates from the original campaign (such\
  \ as the third eye, Zellara's Harrow Deck, or the Crown of Fangs itself), others\
  \ are brand new or have been quantified as items for the first time, including full\
  \ details on the Everdawn Pool and rules for the strange poison known as \"fool's\
  \ leprosy\" that Ileosa uses on her husband!</p> \n       <h2>Appendix 6: NPC Codex</h2>\
  \ \n       <p>Curse of the Crimson Throne relies heavily on its NPCs, be they villains\
  \ or allies. This appendix begins with an index that lists all of the significant\
  \ NPCs in the adventure, along with their role and the page number you can find\
  \ their stats on. But the meat of this appendix are the twelve significant NPCs\
  \ presented in two-page formats. Here's where you'll find information on key NPCs\
  \ like Laori Vaus, Blackjack, and Ileosa herself, along with a few newcomers—we've\
  \ included statistics for Kazavon himself, for example, in case your PCs are unfortunate\
  \ enough to let the mighty blue dragon come back to life! Many of these NPC entries\
  \ include additional rules options utilized by these characters, such as new spells\
  \ or feats—and if the PCs play their cards right, they'll be able to learn these\
  \ new options from NPCs they encounter!</p> \n       <h2>Appendix 7: Bestiary</h2>\
  \ \n       <p>Finally, we've got the bestiary. Here, we've provided several random\
  \ encounter tables for you to roll up wandering monsters to spice up play, but have\
  \ also presented full stat blocks for several new monsters: the soul-powered akaruzug,\
  \ the tragic chained spirit, the malevolent danse macabre, the immense and alien\
  \ havero, the plucky house drake, the pain-infused pharmakos, the lumbering red\
  \ reaver, and two types of vermin that infest the city of Korvosa: drain spiders\
  \ and dream spiders.</p> \n      </div>\n     </div> \n     <h2>More Art!</h2> \n\
  \     <p>And of course, I don't want to leave you without showing off some more\
  \ of the new art we ordered for the hardcover edition. Check out these new interpretations\
  \ of classic fights from the original adventures!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
