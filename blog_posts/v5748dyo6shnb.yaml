  \  <br> \n     <h3>About the Cast</h3> \n     <h4>Troy Lavallee</h4> \n     <p>Troy\
  \ Lavallee is the co-founder and CEO of The Glass Cannon Network. His adventures\
  \ in role-playing began in the mid-90s with Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2nd\
  \ Edition. After a 20 year hiatus from tabletop gaming, his love for the hobby was\
  \ furiously rekindled when introduced to Pathfinder in 2011. After receiving an\
  \ MFA in Acting from Columbia University in 2003, Troy spent the better part of\
  \ two decades pounding the pavement as an actor, writer, producer and stand-up comedian\
  \ in New York City. The Glass Cannon Network was born out of a love not only for\
  \ gaming but for using the collaborative nature of RPGs to create epic serialized\
  \ stories that have the potential to rival anything on Network television. Troy\
  \ is the primary Gamemaster for the Network but also plays several characters on\
  \ their Patreon exclusive shows considered both highly entertaining and GM nightmares\
  \ that would never be allowed in home games. You can follow Troy on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/troylavallee/\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/troylavallee\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> at @troylavallee</p> \n     <h4>Noura Ibrahim</h4>\
  \ \n     <p>Noura is an actor and live streamer. She has played Jahan in the mobile\
  \ app game Ingress by Niantic Labs (makers of Pokemon Go!) and has made worldwide\
  \ in-character appearances at Anomaly events. As a live steamer, you can find her\
  \ playing Nahara on the new official Dungeons and Dragons show Black Dice Society.\
  \ Noura is best known for her role as Ib on the Vampire The Masquerade chronicle\
  \ LA By Night, as well as Ezmerelda D’Avenir on Realmsmith’s Curse of Strahd campaign\
  \ Into The Mist. She appears as Jasmine on the all Princess D&amp;D show Damsels,\
  \ Dice and Everything Nice on Pixel Circus, and as Nox Arya on Cyberpunk Red GM’\
  ed by Cyberpunk creator Mike Pondsmith. She can also occasionally be found streaming\
  \ Call of Cthulhu, World of Darkness, and other ttrpg systems on QueueTimes, The\
  \ Glass Cannon Network, and Stream of Blood. Noura earned her black belt in Kuk\
  \ Sool Won while living in South Korea where she also studied horseback riding and\
  \ became a member of The Korean Archers Association …because who doesn’t want to\
  \ be a real life action hero?</p> \n     <h4>Alica Marie</h4> \n     <p>\"TTRPG\
  \ Addict\" Alicia Marie is a costume artist and designer, author (The Booty Bible),\
  \ accessibility awareness advocate and fitness pro who turned her love of super-physiques,\
  \ comic books, video game and fantasy art into a creative career. Most known for\
  \ her classic costume nods to Mortal Kombat, Star Trek and Marvel superheros, Alicia,\
  \ who calls herself a “compulsive maker,” creates character looks for media companies\
  \ like Warner Brothers, Netflix, Amazon Prime and for game developers like Netherrealm\
  \ (Mortal Kombat) and Gearbox (Borderlands). She has also designed character looks\
  \ for celebrity clients such as platinum recording artist Megan Thee Stallion and\
  \ WWE superstar Ronda Rousey. Alicia is the physical inspiration for some of the\
  \ fighting characters you see in popular video games. In May, she was introduced\
  \ as a playable character in Sony Interactive/Illfonic’s new game PREDATOR: Hunting\
  \ Grounds. Alicia, who likes to refer to herself as “walking technology” or a “\
  cyborg” following cochlear implant surgery to restore her ability to hear speech\
  \ and sound, is also a voice for accessibility for the deaf and hard-of hearing.\
  \ When she isn’t working on a new costume-look, you can find Alicia at the gym,\
  \ or of course, playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons or other RPG systems LIVE on Twitch.\
  \ You can follow Alicia on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/AliciaMarieBODY/\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AliciaMarieBODY\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@aliciamariebody?lang=en\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">TikTok</a> at @AliciaMarieBODY</p> \n     <h4>Skid Maher</h4>\
  \ \n     <p>Skid has been nerding it up since 1982, when his uncle Sinclair gifted\
  \ him the Basic D&amp;D set (the Tom Moldvay edition) for his ninth birthday. It\
  \ was all downhill from there, as he subsequently dabbled in such classic games\
  \ as Champions, Gamma World, Judge Dredd RPG, Ghostbusters RPG, Robotech RPG, Top\
  \ Secret, Tunnels and Trolls, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles RPG (before it was a\
  \ stupid cartoon), Middle Earth Role-Playing, Beyond the Supernatural, Twilight\
  \ 2000, Price of Freedom, Mechwarrior, and Traveller. Nowadays he spends most of\
  \ his time developing gaming and media projects with the Mozzlestead production\
  \ company, and obsessively watching Ralph Bakshi's Lord of the Rings. He also had\
  \ a letter read on Late Night with David Letterman, and was briefly a very minor\
  \ celebrity on Japanese TV. Oh, and once he saw a blimp.</p> \n     <h4>Joe O’Brien</h4>\
  \ \n     <p>Joe O’Brien is the Co-Founder and COO of the Glass Cannon Network. He\
  \ began playing Pathfinder in 2011 and has a special place in his nerd heart for\
  \ the systems and the adventures published by Paizo. On the Glass Cannon Network,\
  \ Joe has been the GM for Pathfinder Society Scenarios, and a Pathfinder Second\
  \ Edition conversion of The Emerald Spire Superdungeon. Currently, you can hear\
  \ him as a player on The Glass Cannon Podcast, Raiders of the Lost Continent, and\
  \ Legacy of the Ancients, all playing Pathfinder First Edition Adventure Paths.\
  \ You can also catch him on Twitch or YouTube as a cast member on Androids &amp;\
  \ Aliens (an official Starfinder Actual Play), Glass Cannon Live!, New Game, Who\
  \ Dis? (Cyberpunk Red, Alien RPG (Game Mother), Call of Cthulhu), and Blood &amp;\
  \ Blades: The Tin Whistles (a shared-universe tabletop experience playing Blades\
  \ in the Dark produced by Stream of Blood). He is the Handler on Get in the Trunk,\
  \ a Delta Green Actual Play Podcast Series produced by the Glass Cannon Network.\
  \ He is excited to work directly with several members of the Paizo team on this\
  \ project who, over the years, have consistently reinforced the respect and admiration\
  \ he has for the love that goes into their work. He hopes to one day play in a Pathfinder\
  \ game where, in a pivotal moment, with his companions relying on him, he can roll\
  \ anything above a 5. He won’t hold his breath, though. For Highbury!</p> \n   \
  \  <p>Don’t miss the first <a href=\"https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/standalone/pfOneShots\"\
  >Pathfinder One-Shot: Sundered Waves</a> adventure and the liveplay.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>We’re excited to see you all on Saturday, May 29 at 6 p.m. Pacific at <a href=\"\
