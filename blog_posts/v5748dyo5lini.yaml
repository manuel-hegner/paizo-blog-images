  \    </div> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Later this month the new Pathfinder\
  \ Tales novel, <a href=\"/products/btpy9e45\"><em>Hellknight</em></a> by Liane Merciel\
  \ releases! So, I wanted to drop in and tell you all why this book might just be\
  \ your new favorite in the line.</p> \n    <p>If you've been following the novels\
  \ for a while (and if you aren't, you can <a href=\"/products/btpy8dea\">subscribe\
  \ right here</a> and stop missing out), you probably know Liane best from <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8sa9\"><em>Nightglass</em></a> and <a href=\"/products/btpy99k6\"\
  ><em>Nightblade</em></a>. Through the adventures of Isiem and his companions, Liane\
  \ did more than anyone to establish the dark yet terrifyingly realistic flavor of\
  \ Nidal's society, as well as much of our understanding of the winged strix. I make\
  \ no secret of my admiration for the work she's done fleshing out that part of our\
  \ world, so when she proposed turning her attention to Cheliax and the Hellknights,\
  \ I knew that I could trust her to bring some of the most important pieces of our\
  \ campaign setting to life.</p> \n    <p>And did she ever! See, without realizing\
  \ it, Liane had been training for this book for years. She had spent countless sessions\
  \ playing through the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/councilOfThieves\">Council\
  \ of Thieves Adventure Path</a>, steeping in the lore of Westcrown and the surrounding\
  \ region until she was an even greater expert than those of us who created it. She's\
  \ meticulous with the canon, and running across all the tiny cameos and easter eggs\
  \ in this novel made the setting feel <i>alive</i> in the way only the best tie-in\
  \ books do.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb180\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8532-Jheraal.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8532-Jheraal_180.jpeg\"></a>\n   \
  \  <br><i>Illustration by Roberto Pitturru</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>Yet the best\
  \ example of that skill comes in the main characters themselves. You've got Ederras,\
  \ a Chelish paladin of Iomedae struggling to reconcile his calling with his rightful\
  \ place in Cheliax's aristocracy. You've got Velenne, a spellcasting scion of House\
  \ Thrune who can scheme with the best of them. And you've got Jheraal—illustrated\
  \ here by Eric Belisle—a tiefling Hellknight specialized in solving crimes whose\
  \ devotion to her order is trumped only by her dedication to the secret daughter\
  \ she gave up for adoption. While far from perfect, these people are all heroes,\
  \ and together they show better than I've ever seen how Chelish society can emerge\
  \ from the actions of fundamentally ordinary people. Velenne in particular fascinates\
  \ me, because she exemplifies how someone can be part of an evil organization like\
  \ House Thrune and still be human, relatable—even <i>likeable</i>. A person with\
  \ hopes and dreams and loves... and profane compacts with Hell.</p> \n    <p>It's\
  \ a tribute to Liane's work that even Erik Mona, who created Cheliax and House Thrune,\
  \ came away from the novel saying he felt like he understood that part of our setting\
  \ much better now. So if you're playing in a Cheliax-based adventure path—such as,\
  \ say, Hell's Rebels or Hell's Vengeance—there's really no better primer for the\
  \ flavor of those campaigns than <a href=\"/products/btpy9e45\"><em>Hellknight</em></a>.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>So there you go! A paean to the ambiguities of society and the human\
  \ condition, and—</p> \n    <p>Wait, what's that? You want to know what the book's\
  \ actually <i>about</i>?</p> \n    <p>Oh, well, there's somebody hideously murdering\
  \ tieflings in Westcrown and stealing their still-beating hearts. And shadow monsters.\
  \ And graveknights. And an exploration of the Hellknights' greatest shame, one so\
  \ sinister that an entire order was destroyed to keep it quiet. Sound good? Yeah,\
  \ I thought so too.</p> \n    <p>Anyway, please give the book a read, then come\
  \ back to the forums to let me and Liane know what you think—we'd love to hear from\
  \ you!</p> \n    <p style=\"clear: both;\">James L. Sutter<br> <i>Executive Editor</i></p>\
