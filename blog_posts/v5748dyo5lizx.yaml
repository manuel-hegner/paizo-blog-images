  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Friday, July 29, 2016</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"\
  > \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">It's that magical time of year again when I\
  \ break my time into 30 minute chunks as I leap from state to state and country\
  \ to country for the annual ritual of level-draining known as \"Con Season.\" I\
  \ only just returned to the States from (the absolutely wonderful, it must be said)\
  \ PaizoCon UK, and here I sit in my office with only a few more working hours before\
  \ it's time to head out to the big one—GEN CON!</p> \n    <p>This year marks my\
  \ 22nd consecutive year at the convention, and I'm still just as excited about going\
  \ as I was that very first year. Since I haven't gotten a chance to actually play\
  \ a game at Gen Con since the 1990s*, these days the aspect of the convention that\
  \ most gets my blood pumping is the chance to see old friends from all over the\
  \ world in the evenings. Also, for about an hour on Sunday, after all the business\
  \ meetings and seminars and media interviews are over, I like to speed-walk the\
  \ trade hall on the hunt for new miniatures!</p> \n    <p>All of the best minis\
  \ manufacturers are present at the show, displaying their latest and greatest offerings.\
  \ Because of strange timing this year, WE don't have any brand new WizKids <a href=\"\
  /pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder Battles</a> sets to show off, though we will have\
  \ a few cases of <a href=\"/products/btpy9er4\"><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a>\
  \ that we managed to find recently. So if you missed that much-in-demand set the\
  \ first time, you'll have a chance to check it out in the Paizo booth (#103).</p>\
  \ \n    <p>We'll also have a few new metal miniatures from our friends at Reaper\
  \ Miniatures making their debut in the Paizo store, including iconic characters\
  \ from <a href=\"/products/btpy9egu\"><em>Occult Adventures</em></a> and a few other\
  \ exciting surprises.</p> \n    <p>As in past years, we've set up a special promotional\
  \ repaint miniature FREE with purchases of $50 or more at the Paizo booth. This\
  \ year's promo mini is the Blue Guard, a repaint of the Guard from <a href=\"/products/btpy9er4\"\
  ><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a> that we've produced in extremely limited quantities.\
  \ We should have a FEW of this guy left over for sale here on paizo.com after we\
  \ get back from the show, but I wouldn't expect him to last long. He's really cool,\
  \ and guards are the type of figures most GMs want by the small handful.</p> \n\
  \    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK72052-8-10-PR1.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK72052-8-10-PR1_120.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>We'll also be giving away top-secret promo repaints to all\
  \ ticketed players of the Friday and Saturday night Pathfinder Society Specials\
  \ in the massive Sagamore Ballroom. If you're there on Friday night especially,\
  \ there's a good chance that I or a member of the Paizo editorial staff will hand-deliver\
  \ your limited-edition figure, just by way of saying \"thanks\" for playing Pathfinder\
  \ and enjoying what we do. We couldn't do it without you, and a free miniature every\
  \ once in a while is but a token of our appreciation for your continued gaming loyalty\
  \ and support.</p> \n    <p>But most of you won't be at Gen Con, and you're probably\
  \ eager to see more previews of figures from the upcoming <a href=\"/products/btpy9kcu\"\
  ><em>Deadly Foes</em></a> set. I've been on the road at conventions the last two\
  \ Fridays, so it's understandable if everyone is a little bit starved of previews.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>So let's get on with it!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    \
  \ <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160729-Peri.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160729-Peri_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>It's unbelievably hot in Seattle right now, so today's\
  \ previews both involve FIRE! Up first we have the Peri, from <a href=\"/products/btpy8odu\"\
  ><em>Bestiary 3</em></a>. Peris are a race of celestials native to the good-aligned\
  \ Outer Planes, but they are often found in the company of mortals on the Material\
  \ Plane. Sworn enemies of divs, Peris are drawn from Persian mythology, and their\
  \ fiery wings certainly give them a nifty appearance. At CR 14, you're gonna want\
  \ a pretty titanic battle to make up for these guys being in the Common rarity slot,\
  \ but hey, at least they look really sweet with clear wings and a great sculpt.\
  \ The Peri is a Medium figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160729-Erinyes.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160729-Erinyes_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>As I sit here writing this, the sun is beating into my\
  \ office, which has surely grown as hot as the flaming bow of this incredible Erinyes\
  \ devil. It's difficult to believe it's taken us this long to create one of the\
  \ most iconic and beloved devils, but some of our early sets were so filled with\
  \ winged female fiends that I wanted to wait for the right time for this specific\
  \ creature to strike. WizKids has done a phenomenal job with the sculpt—don't let\
  \ the relatively simple paint job fool you. This one is a winner. The Erinyes is\
  \ a Medium, uncommon figure.</p> \n    <p>And that's it! I'm off to Gen Con. If\
  \ you can catch me between meetings in the Paizo booth, I'd love to chat with you\
  \ about <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder Battles</a>, miniatures in general,\
  \ or pretty much whatever! It's great to get to see our customers face-to-face at\
  \ the show, and more than a few of those conversations have resulted in figures\
  \ added to the line, so you never know! I'm always open to suggestions.</p> \n \
  \   <p>See you at the show, or see you back here in a couple weeks!</p> \n    <p>Until\
  \ then, I remain...</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p> \n    <p class=\"\
  tiny\">* Ok, that's a bit of an exaggeration! I'm actually playing in a LIVE Pathfinder\
  \ game this year with Jason Bulmahn, F. Wesley Schneider, and Crystal Frasier! It's\
  \ the Live RPG Plus \"celebrity\" gaming event on Saturday night at 7:00 in the\
  \ Westin Capitol III room. I understand tickets are still available. You can find\
