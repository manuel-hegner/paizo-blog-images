  \ Spotlight blog series! Nearly every Monday, we’ll focus on a different wonderful\
  \ industry creator, as an individual, including Paizo staff, freelancers, contractors,\
  \ podcast players, streamers, YouTubers, licensed partners, and more. The format\
  \ is a list of standardized questions from which interviewees can choose. Request\

  \   <h3>Tell us about yourself. What is your bio? What's your story behind the bio?\
  \ Why do you do what you do?</h3> \n     <p>A few weeks ago folks got my dry, more\
  \ business-y bio in the PaizoCon 2022 announcement blog. While it’s true that I\
  \ started writing for Pathfinder in 2013, it’s difficult to get to know a person\
  \ through a formal bio. So let’s get informal.</p> \n     <p>I’m a queer transgender\
  \ woman, though I only discovered this about 5 years ago. I literally discovered\
  \ this about myself through playing and writing for Pathfinder. While I was writing\
  \ <em>Pathfinder Society Special 8–99: The Solstice Scar</em>, I devised the character\
  \ of Medda Spiritbearer, a central NPC to the adventure. While writing it, a trans\
  \ friend of mine was talking about how there could be more trans representation\
  \ in Pathfinder Society (there’s loads now, but back then we just had one character\
  \ and she was… played for laughs. It wasn’t good.) I thought, “I can make Medda\
  \ trans, sure!” I started researching transgender women, what it means to be trans,\
  \ and even got a popular trans consultant to assist with writing the character.\
  \ It didn’t take long for me to realize that the way trans women experienced the\
  \ world, the feelings they had about themselves, were startlingly relatable. I came\
  \ out about a year later. You can read more about <a href=\"http://knowdirectionpodcast.com/2018/07/inspire-confidence-know-thyself/\"\
  ><b>that here.</b></a></p> \n     <p>I’m a non-athletic video-game nerd at heart.\
  \ I love playing on PC and consoles, you name it. I find gaming in all forms to\
  \ be an engaging form of puzzle solving, storytelling, and dopamine production all\
  \ rolled into one. Some of my favorites are the <em>Final Fantasy</em> series, <em>Super\
  \ Metroid</em>, <em>Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</em>, and <em>Street Fighter\
  \ II</em>.</p> \n     <p>I have a film degree! …but I’ve never used it professionally.\
  \ Even though I’ve been trained as a writer and director, by the time I graduated\
  \ I had a steady job in Information Technology and the film industry was in a bit\
  \ of a slump, so entry level jobs were difficult to find. However, I do find use\
  \ of my degree constantly while working on creative projects. The axiom “Always\
  \ preserve your options,” has resonated with me throughout my careers. Essentially,\
  \ “don’t limit yourself to a decision before you have to.” In film this meant shooting\
  \ in color, even if you wanted black &amp; white as an end result. By shooting in\
  \ color, you have more “channels” of light to adjust before desaturating everything.\
  \ And if you want to keep that red umbrella red? You can isolate it from the filters\
  \ instead of having to colorize it later.</p> \n     <p>My passion for TTRPGs is\
  \ greater than just about any other form of entertainment. I’d rather be rolling\
  \ dice with friends than watching a movie, going to the park, or just about anything.\
  \ It’s my #1 thing I’d want to do with my spare time, given the option. Dice and\
  \ characters and settings! Oh my!</p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Tell us about a project\
  \ you are particularly proud of!</h3> \n     <p>I’m extremely proud of <em>Pathfinder\
  \ Society Scenario #8-07: From the Tome of Righteous Repose</em>. It was the first\
  \ evergreen PFS scenario to start above 1st level, and it’s essentially a build-a-dungeon.\
  \ When I was asked to write it, I remember thinking about how so many evergreens\
  \ at the time were the same story and maps over and over, but with slightly different\
  \ foes. I wanted something that really felt unique at the table, and gave GMs the\
  \ creative control to homebrew their own dungeon crawl (within a limited number\
  \ of pre-approved options). There’s even a way to roll up a random set of challenges,\
  \ which is how I always run it. I allow the players to roll on the tables just before\
  \ running the adventure, so I don’t even know what I’m running until we get started.</p>\
  \ \n     <br> \n     <h3>Where do you draw your inspiration?</h3> \n     <p>Pop\
  \ culture mostly? But not just what’s popular now; I draw from the cartoons I watched\
  \ as a kid and books I read as a teen. I also play the “what if” game a lot where\
  \ I take a set of given circumstances and ask myself “what if ___ is really happening?”\
  \ or “what if the NPC is really a ____?” These brainstorms usually land a few chunks\
  \ of gold (or at least silver) that I can then build into a fun adventure!</p> \n\
  \     <br> \n     <h3>What are your goals or dreams as a creator?</h3> \n     <p>I’\
  d LOVE to open my own video game studio and make the kinds of games I loved as a\
  \ kid. So… that’s just what I’m doing with Ninja Cat Games. It’s a little start-up\
  \ studio I’m still trying to get off the ground, but so far it looks like it might\
  \ just be a rocket ride!</p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>How have you seen immersive\
  \ fantasy worlds and cooperative strategic play bring people together and create\
  \ lifelong friendships?</h3> \n     <p>Through the Organized Play system, mostly.\
  \ After having volunteered as a Venture–Captain for years, and gone to Gen Con for\
  \ even longer, I’ve meet people from all over the country—all over the world! It’\
  s really amazing, and I feel really lucky to have met so many awesome people in\
  \ all different places around the world. Sometimes my wife will mention a city or\
  \ European country and I interject, “—Oh, I have some friends who live there!”</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Sitting and a table and sharing an experience with other people, and\
  \ working together towards a common goal, is a way to open lines of communication\
  \ and friendship like nothing else. And because the players are all working together\
  \ rather than against each other, there’s no animosity like in… say… competitive\
  \ professional sports.</p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>What piece of advice that you\
  \ have been given as a creator that is either so great that you have to tell us\
  \ about it, or so awful that you have to warn us?</h3> \n     <p>I have two good\
  \ pieces of advice, and they go hand in hand:</p> \n     <ol> \n      <li><b>Everyone\
  \ is late at some point.</b> I rallied against this for a while early in my career.\
  \ I’d say “Not me! I’ve never been late and I don’t intend to start now.” Then…\
  \ then I had some really challenging months and fell far behind several projects.\
  \ I even had to “give back” some assignments or parts of assignments so that I could\
  \ take care of the things going on in my life. I was devastated. I’d never been\
  \ late before. I was so PROUD of that… but that’s just what it was: pride. It’s\
  \ ok to be late, and it’s ok if you fall behind sometimes. You just need to…</li>\
  \ \n      <br> \n      <li><b>Communicate with your Developer.</b> Let them know\
  \ about issues you’re having, parts of the plot that aren’t jelling, or a monster\
  \ ability that you can envision conceptually but just can’t get in words. And if\
  \ you’re overwhelmed and not be able to turn your words in on time (and within 5%\
  \ of the word count), then just talk with them. They might be able to buy you more\
  \ time. They might want to re-assign some words. That’s ok. Just communicate with\
  \ them and be clear and honest about the expectations of getting something done,\
  \ and with good enough quality to print.</li> \n     </ol> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Please\
  \ tell us about your pet!</h3> \n     <p>My cat, Bella, is a black American shorthair.\
  \ She is a cuddle MONSTER. That’s all she ever wants is to cuddle (or to be left\
  \ alone to sleep). Recently she’s decided that “tent time” is the best time: that’\
  s when we lay in bed and lift our knees up to create a “tent” under the covers.\
  \ She likes to sleep down there.,/p&gt; </p>\n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a\

  \   <br> \n     <h3>If you could be any iconic, who would you be?</h3> \n     <p>If\
  \ I could be any iconic I’d be Seoni. She’s hot, she has powerful magic, and these\
  \ awesome magic tattoos. Plus she’s really smart and a good leader.</p> \n     <p>However…\
  \ I’m probably most like Merisiel. I’m kind of a disaster, but well intentioned.\
  \ I saw the wrong thing at the wrong time, much to my wife’s dismay, and when I\
  \ get angered, I get can get stabby (verbally, of course).</p> \n     <br> \n  \
  \   <h3>If you could live anywhere in the world, where would you live and why?</h3>\
  \ \n     <p>New York City. It’s the greatest city in the world, and when I’m there\
  \ I feel like I’m in the right place. The first time I visited is when I was about\
  \ 25 and I brought my little brother along. We walked all around the city, slept\
  \ on a bench, visited museums, and just hung out in Central Park. From that moment\
  \ I knew that I wanted to live there someday.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n   </div>\
