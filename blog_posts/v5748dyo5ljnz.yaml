  \ Strategy #7â€”Attempting Your Checks</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, March\
  \ 14, 2017</p> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\"><i>This is the seventh installment\
  \ of our strategy blog written by game historian <a href=\"http://erzo.org/shannon/index.phtml\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Shannon Appelcline</a>. You can read all the installments <a\
  \ href=\"/paizo/blog/tags/adventureCardGameStrategy\">here</a>.</i></p> \n    <p>The\
  \ heart of PACG is attempting checks to acquire boons and defeat banes. And every\
  \ check starts with dice that need to be rolled.</p> \n    <h2>Know Your Dice Results</h2>\
  \ \n    <p>Checks are all about rolling dice, so the heart of managing a check is\
  \ knowing your dice. Obviously, if the results of a check aren't that important,\
  \ you should just throw your dice and see what happens. However, if you really want\
  \ to gain a boon or defeat a bane, then you should understand your odds.</p> \n\
  \    <p>You can calculate the odds of your dice in a number of ways. This listing\
  \ goes from least conservative (you might lose!) to most conservative (you won't\
  \ lose!):</p> \n    <ul>\n     <li><i><b>Count </b></i><b>dice + sides<i> then divide.</i></b>\
  \ Add up the number of dice and all their sides, then divide by 2, then add the\
  \ modifiers. For example, if you're rolling 1d8 + 1d6+2, add 2 (the number of dice)\
  \ + 8 (the number of sides on the first die) + 6 (the number of sides on the second\
  \ die) to get 16. Divide that by 2 to get 8 (that's the expected value of your <i>roll</i>),\
  \ then add 2 (the modifier) to get your <i>expected result</i>: 10. If the difficulty\
  \ of your check is also 10, your odds of succeeding are a bit better than 50%. (The\
  \ example given has 48 possible die combinations. 21 of them give a result less\
  \ than 10, 6 equal to 10, and 21 higher than 10, so the odds of succeeding are 27\
  \ in 48, or just over 56%.) So if your expected result is the same as the difficulty\
  \ of the check, you will succeed more often than not, but you will still lose <i>often</i>.\
  \ This method of calculation is also a bit cumbersome for quick counting.</li> \n\
  \     <li><b><i>Count half the sides.</i></b> This author's preferred technique\
  \ is to just count half the sides on each of the dice, then add the modifiers. For\
  \ the 1d8 + 1d6+2 example, add 4 (half the sides on the first die) + 3 (half the\
  \ sides on the second die) + 2 (the modifier) to get an expected result of 9. Not\
  \ only is this quicker to count than the <i>dice</i> + <i>sides</i> technique, but\
  \ it also underestimates a little bit: You'll be under the average by half of the\
  \ number of dice, so it's a bit more conservative. (Using the example above, you'll\
  \ want to look for a way to add a +1 to reach the difficulty of 10, which would\
  \ increase your odds to 33 in 48, or nearly 69%.)</li> \n     <li><i><b>Count every\
  \ die as a 2.</b></i> It may have been Obsidian's Nathan Davis who suggested that\
  \ you should assume every die you roll comes up a 2. With this method, our 1d8 +\
  \ 1d6+2 example gets you an expected result of 6 (2+2+2), so if the difficulty you're\
  \ looking for is 10, you'll want to add 2 dice (of any size) to make up the difference.\
  \ (Adding even 2d4 improves your odds to above 95% in the example.) This is a very\
  \ conservative method, but if you use it for the most important stuff, you're rarely\
  \ going to fail.</li> \n     <li><b><i>Count every die as a 1.</i></b> There's only\
  \ one way to be 100% sure of success: your number of dice plus your modifiers must\
  \ be equal to the target you're shooting for. Yes, this is ridiculously conservative,\
  \ but you might want to use this criteria occasionally, particularly at the end\
  \ of a game.</li>\n    </ul> \n    <p>It's easy to use these methods as a basis\
  \ for an even more conservative estimate without requiring much more work. Just\
  \ look at the results in a more ad hoc manner: \"I estimate these dice will get\
  \ me a result of 12 and I need 11 to succeed, so if someone could throw in one more\
  \ blessing, I'd feel a lot better about it\" or \"I need an 11 and I expect that\
  \ from 3 dice, so an extra 2d4 will probably push me over.\") </p>\n    <p><i>Corollary\
  \ #1: More dice move things toward the average.</i> If you're rolling just one die,\
  \ the odds are spread evenly across all the possibilities, but if you throw a whole\
  \ bunch, the odds will cluster toward the middle. For example, trying to get 5 or\
  \ more on 1d12 has an 8-in-12 chance of succeeding (almost 67%). But trying to get\
  \ that on the seemingly similar 2d6 results in a 30-in-36 chance, or just over 83%,\
  \ while 3d4 gives you a 60-in-64 chance, or almost 94%. So if your expected result\
  \ is a just a little bit above the difficulty, but you're using a <i>lot</i> of\
  \ dice, you're more likely to be okay.</p> \n    <p><i>Corollary #2: Rerolling dice\
  \ changes the average.</i> Some monsters, like the Giant Hermit Crab, force you\
  \ to reroll on success, while some weapons, like those that have the Polearm trait,\
  \ allow you to reroll on failure. The math is tricky, but if you're going to have\
  \ to reroll on a success, you want to be sure you can succeed twice in a row. In\
  \ such a case, an average only a teeny bit over your target probably isn't going\
  \ to cut it. On the other hand, when you get to reroll failures, you can be more\
  \ comfortable with marginal averages.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n  \

  \     <p>\"So... best 2 out of 3 then?\"</p> \n    </div> \n    <h2>Know What Blessings\
  \ Can Do</h2> \n    <p>Checks involve not just the dice that the cards say to roll,\
  \ but also the benefits applied by various players, which often come in the form\
  \ of blessings. Some checks are <i>hard</i>, so blessings can be the difference\
  \ between having a poor chance of success and a decent chance.</p> \n    <p>The\
  \ trick is that blessings also usually represent a potential extra exploration.\
  \ Don't be afraid of using them, because you don't necessarily need a <i>lot</i>\
  \ of extra explorations to succeed. But do ask yourself, \"Is using this blessing\
  \ to improve the odds on this check more valuable than having an extra exploration?\"\
  \ Often losing a card, losing a hand of cards, or losing out on a chance to gain\
  \ a boon turns out to be <i>less</i> valuable than an extra exploration, in which\
  \ case it's not worth spending a blessing for <i>that</i> check.</p> \n    <p><i>Corollary\
  \ #1: Keep an eye on the blessings deck.</i> Many blessings recharge if the same\
  \ blessing is atop the blessing deck. Keep an eye on that and the blessings in your\
  \ hand. If they match, be <i>much</i> more willing to use your blessing. It <i>defers</i>\
  \ your extra exploration, as you usually have to go through your deck to get it\
  \ into your hand again, but if you're playing aggressively, it's not lost to you.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The exception is, of course, late in the game. If you're not going to\
  \ cycle through your deck and you're not going to get your deck shuffled by healing\
  \ or some other means, then you should treat discarding and recharging the same\
  \ (and burying too, for that matter).</p> \n    <p><i>Corollary #2: Don't bless\
  \ low skills.</i> Don't waste your blessings on d4 skills unless things seem quite\
  \ dire. A blessing just doesn't add much to a bad skill. (To be precise, it adds\
  \ an average of 2.5 to a roll, where spending that blessing on a d12 skill can be\
  \ over twice as good, adding an average of 6.5 to the roll.) Heck, it can feel wasteful\
  \ to spend a blessing on a d6 skill.</p> \n    <p>If a low skill needs help, look\
  \ instead to powers and spells. If you need to help someone with a bad skill, it's\
  \ more effective to use certain spells and abilities. Lem can often add up to 1d4+3,\
  \ while an Aid spell can add a d6 and a Strength spell might add a +3.</p> \n  \
  \  <p><i>Corollary #3: Don't bless excessively (or otherwise overcommit).</i> Whether\
  \ you're playing blessings, spells, ranged weapons, allies, or some other boon,\
  \ you don't want to overdo it, yet there's a tendency for players to put too many\
  \ dice into a pool. When you roll two or three times your target number, and the\
  \ check wasn't to close a location or defeat a villain, you probably wasted resources\
  \ that could have been used to take extra explorations or to give a player better\
  \ odds on another check.</p> \n    <p>If you count your expected value and you're\
  \ over your target by more than half, or you've got more than a few extra dice,\
  \ consider if you really need everything that's in the pool, especially if getting\
  \ there required discarding or burying cards.</p> \n    <p>Next time: Managing your\
  \ encounters.</p> \n    <p>Shannon Appelcline<br> <i>Game Historian</i></p> \n \
