  \ \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Rangers have a long tradition in heroic adventure.\
  \ Whether they're portrayed as lone striders keeping the edges of the wilderness\
  \ free of the threats that lurch forth from the world's shadows, as hunters tracking\
  \ down fugitives or beasts, or as skilled archers serving as a scouting force for\
  \ a local lord or group of village elders, rangers have a special place in our fantastical\
  \ imagination.</p> \n    <p>For the Pathfinder Playtest, we decided to cleave closer\
  \ to the core principles of the ranger—a rough and tumble warrior in the wild, possibly\
  \ of the wild himself. Because of this, the most significant change we made to the\
  \ class was that it no longer has spellcasting ability, at least as a default. Of\
  \ course, this doesn't mean we have to abandon this aspect of the Pathfinder First\
  \ Edition ranger forever. Because of the way classes are now structured, it would\
  \ be easy to create a spellcasting build of the ranger later using Spell Points\
  \ (like the paladin), but for the Playtest, we are trying out a a spell-less ranger.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>But enough of what the ranger doesn't have. Let's take a look at what\
  \ he does.</p> \n    <h2>Ranger Features</h2> \n    <p>First and foremost, the ranger\
  \ is a hunter. In Pathfinder First Edition, you picked creature types or subtypes\
  \ that you were skilled at hunting. There are few things more frustrating than playing\
  \ a ranger who rarely—or worst of all, never—encounters their favored enemies. It\
  \ also led to some players who tended to play in more human-centric campaigns picking\
  \ the human subtype, even if their backgrounds may have pointed to better choices\
  \ for favored enemies.</p> \n    <p>This time we made the ranger hunting ability\
  \ a bit more flexible, based on some popular ideas from the guide archetype and\
  \ the slayer's studied target. At 1st level, rangers gain the Hunt Target feature.</p>\
  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-title\">[[A]] Hunt Target</p>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">Ranger</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Requirements</b>\
  \ You can see or hear the target.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">You designate\
  \ a single creature within 100 feet as your target and focus your attacks against\
  \ that creature. While hunting that creature, you gain benefits for focusing your\
  \ attacks. As long as all your attacks in a round are against the target you're\
  \ hunting, the multiple attack penalty you take on the second attack is -4 (-3 with\
  \ an agile weapon) instead of -5, and -8 (-6 with an agile weapon) instead of -10\
  \ on the third and any further attacks in the round. You also ignore the penalty\
  \ for making ranged attacks against the target you're hunting within your second\
  \ range increment. You also gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception checks when\
  \ you Seek your target and a +2 circumstance bonus to Survival checks when you Track\
  \ your target.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">You can have only one creature\
  \ designated as the target of your hunt at a time. If you use Hunt Target against\
  \ a creature when you already have a creature designated, the prior creature loses\
  \ the designation and the new target gains the designation. In any case, this designation\
  \ lasts until your next daily preparation.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <div class=\"\

  ></a> \n     <p><i>Illustration by Wayne Reynolds</i></p>\n    </div> \n    <p>There\
  \ are many class feats and some higher-level abilities that augment the ranger's\
  \ Hunt Target. For example, at 17th level, the masterful hunter feature decreases\
  \ the ranger's multiple attack penalty to -3 (or -2 with agile weapon) with his\
  \ second attack and -6 (or -4 with agile weapons) on his third or further attack,\
  \ and he can ignore the penalty against the target of his hunt in the second or\
  \ third range increment, assuming that he has at least master proficiency in the\
  \ weapon he is. Speaking of which, like the fighter, the ranger gains weapon mastery\
  \ for a group of weapons, though he gains it at 13th level instead of at 3rd level\
  \ like the fighter. At 19th level, the ranger gains the swift target feature, which\
  \ allows him to use Hunt Target as a free action triggered before he makes his first\
  \ Strike each round, so he's never without a target to hunt! The specifics of the\
  \ Hunt Target ability make the ranger excel at a variety of combat styles, especially\
  \ his traditional two-weapon fighting (since you can decrease the multiple attack\
  \ penalty with agile attacks to be incredibly small) and archery (since you eliminate\
  \ some of the most common ranged increment penalties). Of course, a ranger with\
  \ a less traditional style, like a greatsword with a reduced multiple attack penalty,\
  \ works great too!</p> \n    <p>Other class features allow the ranger to stalk and\
  \ avoid his foes. At 5th level, he gains trackless step. At 7th level, he gains\
  \ evasion (followed by improved evasion at 15th level). He gains nature's edge at\
  \ 9th level, which allows him to treat enemies in natural difficult terrain or in\
  \ difficult terrain resulting from a snare (more on snares later!) as flat-footed.\
  \ Come 11th level, he gains the wild stride feature, which allows him to ignore\
  \ or minimize the effects of difficult terrain.</p> \n    <h2>Ranger Feats</h2>\
  \ \n    <p>Class feats, of course, determine the flavor of individuals within a\
  \ class, and the ranger is no different. Specific ranger feats allow him to gain\
  \ an animal companion at the same progression as a druid's, though potentially with\
  \ special benefits that only a ranger can obtain. Other feats will enable him to\
  \ further focus on his weapon choice, including a whole string of feats that allow\
  \ him to specialize in two-weapon fighting.</p> \n    <p>Some fun feats allow the\
  \ ranger to use his knowledge and senses to aid his allies as well as himself. Here\
  \ are a couple of my favorites.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-title\"\
  >Monster Hunter <span class=\"stat-block-cr\">Feat 1</span></p> \n     <p class=\"\
  stat-block-1\">Ranger</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">When you critically succeed\
  \ to identify a target you're hunting with Recall Knowledge, you (and your allies,\
  \ if you tell them) gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your next attack roll against\
  \ it, but not against other creatures of that species. The creature is bolstered.</p>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"stat-block-title\">[[F]] Scout's Warning <span class=\"stat-block-cr\"\
  >Feat 4</span></p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">Ranger</p> \n     <p class=\"\
  stat-block-1\"><b>Trigger</b> You are about to roll Perception for initiative.</p>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">You audibly or visually warn your allies of danger,\
  \ granting them a +1 circumstance bonus to their initiative rolls.</p> \n    </blockquote>\
  \ \n    <p>Harkening back to the hunter's bond class feature in Pathfinder First\
  \ Edition, these feats allow the ranger to support the rest of the group with increased\
  \ flexibility in how he chooses to do so, and these are just a few. The ranger can\
  \ expand on Monster Hunter to grant even more benefits with a successful Recall\
  \ Knowledge and even share the benefits of Hunt Target with other PCs (pretty much\
  \ any martial class will love this benefit). And while flanking-savvy fighters might\
  \ be a rogue's traditional best friend, the 12th-level Distracting Shot feat allows\
  \ the ranger who hits a target with two ranged attacks in the same turn to leave\
  \ that critter flat-footed until the start of the ranger's next turn. This helps\
  \ fast rogues bring the pain quickly and farther away from more heavily armored\
  \ support.</p> \n    <p>Another group of feats allows you to create snares. (Told\
  \ you I'd get to that!)</p> \n    <h2>Snares</h2> \n    <p>Like alchemy, the ability\
  \ to create snares is granted by a general feat (Snare Crafting). And like alchemists,\
  \ rangers have the potential to lift general snare crafting to greater heights.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>What are snares? Well, they're small portable hazards, very similar to\
  \ traps, which can be set up in a short period of time (usually 1 minute). While\
  \ it's unlikely that you will set up a snare in the midst of combat, they are perfect\
  \ tools to arrange a battleground to your advantage. For instance, remember the\
  \ nature's edge class feature that allows you to treat enemies in difficult terrain\
  \ as flat-footed? Here's the most basic snare that creates difficult terrain.</p>\
  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-title\">Slowing Snare <span class=\"\
  stat-block-cr\">Snare 1</span></p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">Consumable,\
  \ Mechanical, Snare, Trap</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Price</b> 2 gp</p>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">A square with this snare becomes difficult terrain\
  \ when the first creature enters it, and then it is destroyed.</p> \n    </blockquote>\
  \ \n    <p>Other snares set off alarms, trip, or deal damage to those entering the\
  \ area of a snare. Grab some alchemical items, and you can deal even more damage\
  \ with a snare.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-title\">Freezing\
  \ Snare <span class=\"stat-block-cr\">Snare 8</span></p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"\
  >Cold, Consumable, Mechanical, Snare, Trap</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"\
  ><b>Price</b> 50 gp</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">You set a trio of liquid\
  \ ice bombs to explode in unison when a creature enters the freezing snare's square.\
  \ The target must attempt a DC 22 Reflexsave.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"\
  ><b>Success</b> The target takes 1d8 cold damage.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"\
  ><b>Critical Success</b> The target is unaffected.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"\
  ><b>Failure</b> The target takes 3d8 cold damage and is hampered 10 until the end\
  \ of its next turn.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Critical Failure</b>\
  \ The target takes 6d8 cold damage and is hampered 10 until the end of its next\
  \ turn.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Craft Requirements</b> three vials\
  \ of liquid ice</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Ranger feats that deal with snares\
  \ allow you to learn more of them as your Crafting rank increases, lets you set\
  \ them up faster (even in the middle of combat), and increases snares' DCs to match\
  \ your class DC. Always make sure that your allies know where you hid your snares,\
  \ or no bonus to attack rolls or initiative that you grant them will make up for\
  \ the damage and humiliation you might cause.</p> \n    <p>Stephen Radney-MacFarland<br>\
