  \ bathes the artificial landscape around me, assaulting my senses with a kaleidoscope\
  \ of neon blues, greens and pinks. The sound of moving mechanical lifeforms and\
  \ low-altitude vehicles creates a cacophony that somehow manages to generate an\
  \ odd harmony with one another. Hundreds of beings, both organic and mechanical\
  \ alike, maneuver the wide open streets of the megaplex city with guided purpose.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Aballon, the so-called Forge of this system and where I now stand, is\
  \ something I’d never experienced in my long-life: a world inhabited by self-upgrading\
  \ machines. Not confined to one form, these machines—anacites as they collectively\
  \ refer to themselves—have spread across the small world closest to the Pact Worlds’\
  \ sun, gradually converting the world into something wondrous. Yet, even for a species\
  \ who could so easily disconnect themselves from organic concerns, they’ve built\
  \ their great cities to accommodate those around them.</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  \ alt=\"This is an urban scene of a high-tech city built by machines, for machines.\
  \ There are towering structures and a wide variety of robots, from huge to tiny,\
  \ flying or walking around. The sky overhead is just space and stars (no atmosphere).\
  \ The city is very clean and orderly, but in a way that caters specifically to robots.\"\

  \    </div> \n     <p>I came here to study the Pact Worlds, to walk its many worlds\
  \ and meet its many people in hopes of learning their cultures. One of my siblings\
  \ had spent much of their time in this place and had come to respect the Pact Worlds’\
  \ people. Another sibling, now deceased, had sought to one day venture to this star\
  \ system, although their intentions were far less academic than my own. As for my\
  \ final sibling, I couldn’t be sure if they even know this place exists.</p> \n\
  \     <p>An elevated vidcast monitor several hundred feet wide displays a white-furred\
  \ rat woman snacking on an apple while partaking in an interview. Vendors of all\
  \ backgrounds shout out to passersby about the quality of their wares, each making\
  \ shop in alcoves at the base of massive structures, their presence something clearly\
  \ intended by this place’s inscrutable designers. Even the walkways that I find\
  \ myself on are designed to facilitate both organic and robotic beings alike. Hidden\
  \ lines, invisible to those without augmented sight, direct the settlement’s robotic\
  \ inhabitants in their maneuvering. Meanwhile, the unaugmented organic lifeforms\
  \ disrupt the transit with chaotic movements that routinely cause minor fluctuations\
  \ in the otherwise perfect transit lanes. A controlled chaos of sorts.</p> \n  \
  \   <p>Taking this all in over the course of a few seconds, I compile my first impressions\
  \ on this world. </p> \n     <p>Something pushes against me; the slightest force\
  \ against my leg.</p> \n     <p>“Greetings visitor,” a synthetic voice speaks in\
  \ the Pact Worlds’ common tongue, emitted from a blocky, rectangular robotic lifeform\
  \ less than half my height. Its vocal tone is clearly intended to mask any type\
  \ of association with other species, yet it is fashioned to be appealing to all\
  \ listeners. “Apologies for this unit’s unintended interaction. This unit had not\
  \ properly processed your presence in this area, possibly due to a scanning malfunction.”\
  </p> \n     <p>I smile because that’s what others would expect of me. “No apology\
  \ is necessary. It was my mistake not to properly respect this world’s traffic laws.\
  \ Though, if I may make another imposition, may I ask you a question?”</p> \n  \
  \   <p>The small anacite rolls back on its tiny automated wheels before adjusting\
  \ the position of a small telescopic appendage to view my full body, scanning me\
  \ to resolve its prior error. “This unit does not serve a critical function. This\
  \ unit will respond as best it is able.”</p> \n     <p>“You’re a mechanical being,\
  \ as are most on this world. Why are most the vast settlements of this planet designed\
  \ with the lives of organics in mind?” I ask the question as I’ve yet to truly discern\
  \ the answer—a rare occurrence for me.</p> \n     <p>“This unit understands your\
  \ query. Answer: Aballon and its many megaplex settlements, such as this megaplex\
  \ of Endeavor, were designed in respect for Those Who Wait.”</p> \n     <p>“Those\
  \ who wait?”</p> \n     <p>A mechanical whirr of sound comes from the blocky anacite’\
  s telescope as it adjusts a viewing setting. The other robotic beings around us\
  \ change their ordered line to curve around the conversation. Far above, I see the\
  \ ysoki woman on the vidscreen take another contented bite from her apple. The small\
  \ anacite in front of me makes a final calibration before recalling its telescope\
  \ into its interior, having completed its scan.</p> \n     <p>“Some anacite units\
  \ designate themselves as Those Who Wait. Such anacite units conclude that our creators,\
  \ the First Ones, will one day return to Aballon and as a result our world must\
  \ be made amenable to them.” The small unit continues its response as a new line\
  \ of anacites forms a second queue around us, curving in the opposite direction\
  \ of the existing stream. “Other anacite units designate themselves as Those Who\
  \ Become. Such anacite units conclude that they must take on the role of the First\
  \ Ones and seed the galaxy with new anacite lifeforms.”</p> \n     <p>I maintain\
  \ my smile and nod my head in appreciation of the explanation. The vidcast screen\
  \ in the background has shifted to an advertisement led by a skeletal figure that\
  \ is more of an assault on visual senses than anything near as succinct as my recent\
  \ exchange.</p> \n     <p>“What of you, do you belong to Those Who Wait or Those\
  \ Who Become?”</p> \n     <p>“This unit does not possess sufficient importance to\
  \ hold such a belief. This unit exists to assist in the stability of Endeavor’s\
  \ traffic flow, a task in which this unit is currently failing.”</p> \n     <p>I\
  \ look down at the small anacite, taking in all of its simple boxy form and the\
  \ elegance in its design save for the aesthetic displeasure most other beings would\
  \ see in it. As the small anacite’s vocal emitters finish its statement, I can’\
  t help but feel my siblings mocking me from the past. I stifle my annoyance by suppressing\
  \ my smile.</p> \n     <p>“That seems a shame. Perhaps I can offer a more important\
  \ existence? Would you be willing to act as my guide on this planet? I have credits.”\
  \ I offer my hand down to the anacite.</p> \n     <p>“Acceptable. Assisting newcomers\
  \ is of higher importance than my current designation.” An aperture opens on the\
  \ anacite’s frame, releasing a metallic rod that ends near my hand. I clasp the\
  \ appendage.</p> \n     <p>Together with my new guide, I step through the break\
  \ in the curving line of anacites. The remaining robots adjust their movements to\
  \ form two perfect lines of traffic. Perfection without words.</p> \n     <p style=\"\
