  \     </div> \n     <p>This past week, Mike and I discussed exactly how we wanted\
  \ to handle the process for learning non-Core spells in the Core Campaign. We had\
  \ decided early on to allow wizards to scribe non-Core spells they come across,\
  \ but as many of you pointed out, that leaves bards, clerics, druids, paladins,\
  \ rangers, and sorcerers without any means of learning non-Core spells whatsoever.\
  \ In a way this makes sense, but it's a rather unsatisfying, perverse kind of sense.\
  \ Here's what we're going to do:</p> \n     <ul>\n      <li>Wizard PCs can scribe\
  \ non-Core spells from spellbooks and scrolls during the scenario, but the opportunity\
  \ ends when the scenario does. Record any such spells learned on the Chronicle sheet,\
  \ and have the GM initial the note.</li> \n      <li>If an NPC prepared spellcaster\
  \ has a spellbook but no spells listed in it, he is assumed to have any spells he\
  \ has prepared in the book.</li> \n      <li>Even if he missed his opportunity during\
  \ the scenario, a wizard PC can learn spells from any scroll that appears on a Chronicle\
  \ sheet by purchasing it and scribing it as normal.</li> \n      <li>Other PCs able\
  \ to cast spells—spontaneously or from a divine spell list that does not depend\
  \ on a spellbook—can learn spells they find in scroll form so long as they buy the\
  \ scroll and expend it to add the spell to her list of legal spells; spontaneous\
  \ spellcasters must still expend known spell slots in order to learn the spell.\
  \ These PCs cannot learn non-Core spells from spellbooks.</li>\n     </ul> \n  \
  \   <p>Wizards have always been among the best at incorporating new spells into\
  \ their repertoire, and this keeps them that way while also letting non-wizards\
  \ learn spells from scrolls they purchase from their found Chronicle sheets.</p>\
