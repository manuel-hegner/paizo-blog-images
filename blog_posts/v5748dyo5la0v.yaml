  \ Duel, Gygax-style</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, April 15, 2008</p> \n \
  \  <p>In my last blog post, I mentioned that by far my favorite part of all the\
  \ Gygax fiction I've read is his interpretation of that most classic of fantasy\
  \ tropes: the wizard's duel. While we got a taste of such things in <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy80bn\"\
  ><i>The Anubis Murders</i></a>, the original Dungeon Master takes the art to new\
  \ heights in <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7zdq\"><i>The Samarkand Solution</i></a>,\
  \ showing us the sort of arcane power and creativity Magister Setne Inhetep is capable\
  \ of when pushed to the limit by an another wizard-priest as adept as himself. To\
  \ see what I mean, check out the following excerpt from <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7zdq\"\
  ><i>The Samarkand Solution</i></a>, in which the magister and Inspector Tuhorus\
  \ fight for their lives in the Blood Temple of the Serpent God, Aapep: </p> \n \
  \  <blockquote> <i><p>In the meantime, the conjured snake came at Inhetep, rose,\
  \ and as a fiery redness split its jaws, the iron length lashed forward. Livid crimson\
  \ venom spurted forth in a thick jet. It struck a shining disc which had appeared\
  \ in an instant, splattering into burning droplets, and hissed into nothingness\
  \ as the molten stuff shot into a harmless spray before the magister. But then the\
  \ iron head of the cobra hit the silvery shield, and the disc split into metallic\
  \ shards, which fell chiming to the stone and disappeared. </p> <p> \"Useless!\"\
  \ cried the gloating voice of Aapep's servant. </p> <p> \"Melodious!\" countered\
  \ the magister, and as he spoke the chiming sounds of the falling bits of silvery\
  \ disc continued, were drawn out, and their tinkling became deeper. A plangent three-note\
  \ sequence grew from that, and it resonated in rhythmic waves which filled the cavernous\
  \ temple. \"You pet cobra seems charmed!\" he called out, for the iron monster was\
  \ now swaying before him as if it were some strange metronome. Left, right, back\
  \ and forth it went, but never quite in time with the three sounds which now rolled\
  \ and pulsed throughout the grim underground temple. Faster and faster went the\
  \ unnatural snake as the waves of sound peaked and sank and charged. The reverberations\
  \ were renewed, restated, and repeated, so that ever-closer notes formed an impossible\
  \ mesh around the dark priest-mage's metal monster of death. </p> <p>Knowing that\
  \ his magick was failing, the man was about to try and withdraw the iron snake,\
  \ or send it in a destructive rush to overwhelm his foe, when he caught a glimpse\
  \ of Tuhorus out of the corner of his eye. Letting go of his mental link with the\
  \ cobra, the evil kheri-heb spun and flung a shower of fiery darts in the direction\
  \ of the policeman. Then he continued turning and ran, disappearing down one of\
  \ the tunnels beside the wall of Aapep. </p> <p>Inspector Tuhorus used his blade\
  \ to bat aside the pair of flaming darts which knifed toward his face. Another seared\
  \ his chest as it hissed past. His shirt burst into flames where the fiery missile\
  \ had touched it, and his short cape was likewise set ablaze by another dart which\
  \ passed through its cloth. Then he was struck in the body and limbs by yet more\
  \ of the things. He fell to the floor, writhing in pain, rolling to extinguish the\
  \ fire which now played over him with greedy, searing tongues. </p> <p>The storm\
  \ of sound engendered by Inhetep's counter-heka reached a crescendo, and those ringing\
  \ notes shook the iron snake; it flew suddenly in ten thousand pieces, each a tiny\
  \ meteor that burned hellishly for a split second, then winked into nothingness.\
  \ After the massive pyrotechnic display, the waves of metallic sound ceased, and\
  \ the red light was replaced once again by the faint wash of moonlike glow from\
  \ beyond. The magister had seen the attack upon Tuhorus, for his casting needed\
  \ no concentration to sustain its effect. Setne was hurrying to help the policeman\
  \ when something else distracted him. The six stone statues began to move with ponderous\
  \ steps, and the sinuous depiction of the serpent-dragon started to come alive....</p></i>\
