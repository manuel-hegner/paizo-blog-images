  \ Wark, Wark!</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, May 8, 2012</p> \n   <div style=\"\

  \ <p>Some time ago I played in a campaign that Jason Bulmahn was running. One of\
  \ the many highlights of the campaign was Chuko. This was James Jacobs's tengu character,\
  \ who always shouted \"Wark!\" when he was excited. My whole conception of tengus\
  \ comes from Chuko. They are strange little creatures that steal and mark things\
  \ with flags. Tengus can be unreasonable and stupidly heroic. Chuko was not the\
  \ sharpest egg in the nest, just a strange little outcast in a far-off land. James\
  \ played it to the hilt. If you get the chance to play Pathfinder with James, make\
  \ him play a tengu. Oh, and make him wear a silly hat. </p> \n   <p>Sorry for the\
  \ last bit, James.</p> \n   <p>When it came to reviewing the tengu section of <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy8rv2\"><i>Advanced Race Guide</i></a>, there was a lot that\
  \ made me shout, \"Wark!\" I think Chuko would approve! Now I want to play a tengu.\
  \ </p> \n   <p>Here are just a few highlights from the section. </p> \n   <h2>Tengu\
  \ Equipment</h2> \n   <p>Tengus have access to the following equipment.</p> \n \
  \  <div class=\"blurb180\">\n    <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PZO1121-Tengu.jpg\"\

  \    <br> Illustration by Paul Guzenko\n   </div> \n   <p><b>Signal Kite Kit:</b>\
  \ Though wingless, tengus have long cast their thoughts toward the sky and flight.\
  \ Built from paper glued to bamboo frames, their kites are painted with various\
  \ colors and pictures. In addition to flying kites as a leisure activity, tengus\
  \ also fly kites of various shades and patterns to send signal messages. Tengus\
  \ have developed an extensive code of signals and can use their kites to display\
  \ complex messages visible at great distances. A signal kite kit includes six small\
  \ colored kites that can be hooked together in different patterns to facilitate\
  \ complex messages. The kit also includes a spool and 300 feet of twine. Sending\
  \ or interpreting a signal kite's message functions as described in the Bluff skill,\
  \ but the sender and anyone trying to understand the message must also know Tengu.</p>\
  \ \n   <p><b>Terror Kite:</b> This small kite is usually painted with a fierce face\
  \ and bright colors and is edged with serrated wooden blades. Its twine is strengthened\
  \ by soaking it in glue and sometimes with crushed glass to give it a slight cutting\
  \ edge. The kite has hardness 5 and 3 hit points. Participants in a kite battle\
  \ make alternating sunder combat maneuvers against each other's kites; each successful\
  \ maneuver allows a competitor to roll 1d6 points of damage against the opponent's\
  \ kite. When a kite reaches 0 hit points, it is broken or its string is cut, and\
  \ its player loses the match. In some matches, points are awarded for touching the\
  \ kite's top to the opponent's string, with the winner being the first to reach\
  \ a set point total. Those interested in kite-fighting may select the terror kite\
  \ as a weapon for the purpose of feats such as Weapon Focus and Weapon Specialization,\
  \ and apply these bonuses on kite damage rolls and on their sunder combat maneuver\
  \ attempts made while using terror kites.</p> \n   <h2>Tengu Feats</h2> \n   <p>Tengu\
  \ have access to the following feats.</p> \n   <p><b>Long-Nose Form</b><br> You\
  \ can shift into the form of a human with an unusually long nose.<br> <b>Prerequisites:</b>\
  \ Character level 3rd, tengu.<br> <b>Benefit:</b> Once per day, you can assume the\
  \ form of a human whose nose is the length of your beak. This spell-like ability\
  \ functions as <i>alter self</i> with a caster level equal to your level. While\
  \ in this form you gain the scent ability and a +2 bonus to your Strength score.\
  \ Because your long nose in this form clearly indicates you are not fully human,\
  \ you do not gain the normal bonus to Disguise checks for using a polymorph effect\
  \ (however, you could possibly explain the nose as an unfortunate curse or deformity,\
  \ or hide it with an item such as a plague doctor's mask).</p> \n   <h2>Tengu Spells</h2>\
  \ \n   <p>Tengus have access to the following spells.</p> \n   <p><b>Theft Ward</b><br>\
  \ <b>School</b> abjuration; <b>Level</b> cleric 1, inquisitor 1, sorcerer/wizard\
  \ 1, witch 1<br> <b>Casting Time</b> 1 standard action<br> <b>Components</b> V,\
  \ S<br> <b>Range</b> touch<br> <b>Target</b> one object<br> <b>Duration</b> 1 day</p>\
  \ \n   <p>You ward a single object in your possession against theft. You gain a\
  \ +10 bonus on Perception checks to notice someone trying to take the object from\
  \ you.</p> \n   <p>Hey! Tell us what you want to see next. We want to know what\
  \ you're excited about.</p> \n   <p>Stephen Radney-MacFarland<br> <i>Designer</i></p>\
