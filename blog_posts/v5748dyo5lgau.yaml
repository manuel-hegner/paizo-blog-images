  \ Sky Key</a>, Season 6 of the Pathfinder Society Organized Play campaign, is approaching,\
  \ and that means the new <a href=\"/products/btpy84k4\"><i>Guide to Pathfinder Society\
  \ Organized Play</i></a> is on its way. It's still a few weeks before we preview\
  \ the new guide, but we can share a few new options available at the start of Season\
  \ 6. In fact, there's something for players and something for GMs and organizers.</span></p>\
  \ \n     <p>I imagine you've already spotted the art and guessed that expanded race\
  \ access is one announcement—spot on. Just as non-standard race access is a hot\
  \ topic on the messageboards, it's a common talking point during our meetings. It's\
  \ tough to balance the lure of race boons for conventions against letting as many\
  \ people as possible play the types of characters they want. Add to that the heated\
  \ discussions about whether or not some non-standard races are overpowered and the\
  \ concerns about the so-called \"cantina effect.\" That's a lot to juggle when making\
  \ a decision, but we decided that introducing a few new options would be best for\
  \ the campaign. Beginning August 14th 2014 at Gen Con, three new races will be available\
  \ for play without requiring a special Chronicle sheet: kitsune, nagaji, and wayang.\
  \ These races have been in circulation through extra Chronicle sheets for nearly\
  \ three years now, and even though some players have had an opportunity to create\
  \ these characters, we want newer players to have new options to enjoy. Like other\
  \ race options, it is still necessary that a player have a book or watermarked pdf\
  \ reference for the race, such as from <a href=\"/products/btpy8pfu\"><i>Pathfinder\
  \ Campaign Setting: Dragon Empires Gazetteer</i></a>, <a href=\"/products/btpy8pg0\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Player Companion: Dragon Empires Primer</i></a>, <a href=\"/products/btpy8rv2\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder RPG: Advanced Race Guide</i></a>, or <a href=\"/products/btpy91ds\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary: Bestiary 4</i></a>.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb180\"\

  ></a>\n      <br>Illustration by Eva Widermann\n     </div> \n     <p>So let's see...\
  \ seven core races plus three <i>Bestiary</i> races plus three <i>Dragon Empires</i>\
  \ races. That equals 13, right? Well, there's one piece missing from that equation.\
  \ We're also removing two races.</p> \n     <p>For several years, aasimar and tieflings\
  \ have enjoyed a prominent role in the Pathfinder Society, but as the organization\
  \ concludes its work in Mendev—where numerous pit-born fight for recognition and\
  \ heaven-blooded warriors wage holy war—it's time for them to step back. Beginning\
  \ on August 14th, creating an aasimar or tiefling character will require a special\
  \ Chronicle sheet, as was the case years ago. The exception is any aasimar or tielfing\
  \ character with at least 1 XP; these characters are grandfathered into the campaign.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Does this mean you can create several new characters, play a scenario\
  \ with each, and have several native outsiders waiting for when you need them? Well,\
  \ we debated long and hard whether to require 4 XP per character, as at that point\
  \ one is past the free rebuilding stage. However, we also recognized this as unnecessarily\
  \ punitive to casual players who may only be able to play once or twice in the next\
  \ month. To answer your question, yes, you can make 10 aasimars and play <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy92ci\"><i>The Confirmation</i></a> an equal number of times, but we're\
  \ trusting you'll exercise some good taste and respect a decision made with the\
  \ larger community in mind.</p> \n     <p>Now that we've covered the more controversial\
  \ news, let's wrap things up with something outright awesome.</p> \n     <p>We (both\
  \ Mike and John) both have experience as venture-officers and event coordinators,\
  \ and we understand that sometimes it's tough to convince a new player to commit\
  \ to a full 4-5 hour experience. Some events just are not conducive to running a\
  \ full game, whether that's because it's a weeknight with lots of folks who need\
  \ to get to bed early or because the location is only open for a few hours. What\
  \ do you do when a scenario just isn't short enough?</p> \n     <p>For years the\
  \ answer has been quests, one-hour mini-adventures intended to last an hour or less.\
  \ They're great little adventures, but they're a little difficult to schedule for\
  \ a few reasons. First, there's no easy way to tell a bigger story by connecting\
  \ a few quests together. Second, the quests—though replayable—offer no gold, XP,\
  \ or Prestige Points, giving them a reputation of risk for little reward. The most\
  \ difficult hurdle is that there are only two of them in print (not counting the\
  \ Goblin Attack demos or Beginner's Box Bash demos).</p> \n     <p>This year at\
  \ Gen Con, we're debuting six new 1st-level Pathfinder Quests that take place in\
  \ and around the River Kingdoms. Each one is a standalone adventure, but they are\
  \ all loosely tied into a common plot thread, allowing a GM to combine anywhere\
  \ from two to all six to make a larger adventure as suits the needs of the group\
  \ and event location. Play them in any order—one can even play the finale quest\
  \ early—and earn a Chronicle sheet with rewards that scale based on the number of\
  \ adventures you played.</p> \n     <p>John Compton and Mike Brock<br> <i>Developer\
  \ and Global Organized Play Coordinator</i></p> \n    </div> \n   </blockquote>\
