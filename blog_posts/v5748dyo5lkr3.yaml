  >events schedule</a> for <a href=\"/paizocon\">PaizoCon 2018</a> is now live and\
  \ the process for event registration has begun.</p> \n    <p>Signing up for events\
  \ at PaizoCon begins with an event lottery. The lottery allows hundreds of fans\
  \ to get an equal chance at claiming a coveted spot at small events run by Paizo\
  \ Staff like Crystal Fraiser running a special author edition preview of our <a\
  \ href=\"http://www.freerpgday.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Free RPG Day</a> adventure\
  \ <a href=\"/events/v5748mkg0lia4\"><em>We Be 5uper Goblins</em></a>, gaming industry\
  \ veterans like Jessica Redekop running <a href=\"/events/v5748mkg0ln9o\"><em>Celestial\
  \ Intrigue</em></a> and RPG publishers like Legendary Games running their multi-table\
  \ <a href=\"/events/v5748mkg0lkfz\"><em>Legendary Planet Special: Hope and Salvation</em></a>,\
  \ and many, many more.</p> \n    <p>The first step in the lottery process is to\
  \ head to our events page and set your event preferences. Games that are part of\
  \ the lottery will allow you to rank from 0 (don't want at all) to 4 (really want).\
  \ Our lottery code is designed so that the more events you rank honestly the more\
  \ likely you are to get an event that you want. Ranking preferences goes until on\
  \ <b>Tuesday, May 8th at 2:00 PM Pacific time</b> so don't delay.</p> \n    <p>After\
  \ the preferences sign up closes, we will run our lottery process. For each day,\
  \ people with PaizoCon badges on their accounts who have set preferences are randomly\
  \ ordered and attendees are assigned an event based on their preferences. If all\
  \ of your #4 events are full, it moves onto events you ranked as 3's, then 2's and\
  \ so on until either you are placed in an event for that day or there is nothing\
  \ left that you have a ranked preference for. If the lottery goes through all accounts\
  \ and there are still games left, it repeats the process until all lottery events\
  \ for that day are full or everyone who made a preference selections have been assigned\
  \ events. The lottery runs through each day separately. After the lottery runs,\
  \ we do a quick internal check of the results to make sure the code behaved as it\
  \ should and then on <b>Wednesday, May 9th at 10:00 AM Pacific time</b> we should\
  \ be uploading the results to your online schedule.</p> \n    <p>For attendees that\
  \ must game with another attendee, we do have a buddy system. We recommend that\
  \ only attendees that cannot game alone use this system. If users are marked as\
  \ buddies during the preferences ranking period, the lottery will pair them together\
  \ in events that one of the attendees is placed in. If there is only one space left\
  \ in an event, neither buddy will get that event. Once the lottery has been run,\
  \ buddies no longer affect event placement and during open registration, and accounts\
  \ must register for any additional events separately.</p> \n    <p>When the lottery\
  \ results are live, you'll be able to trade and sign up for open events. These are\
  \ most of the organized play games, seminars, workshops and any games that were\
  \ part of the lottery that did not fill up. We're leaving open event registration\
  \ open as long as possible, however we will need to close it on <b>Monday May 21st</b>\
  \ so that we can print off event tickets and prepare attendees registration packets.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Let us know if you have any questions about how the event lottery and\
  \ registration work. We look forward to seeing you in just a few weeks!</p> \n \
