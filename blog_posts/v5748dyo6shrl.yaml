  \  <blockquote> \n     <h2>OPA Musings</h2> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">The\
  \ news last week about reduced scenario production is, of course, disappointing.\
  \ We’re saddened that we won’t be bringing as much new Pathfinder and Starfinder\
  \ Society content to your tables, but we hope you will take this opportunity to\
  \ try out some of our other sanctioned content for both programs. I myself am starting\
  \ to plan for a <em>Strength of Thousands</em> run with some of our local players,\
  \ and I’m very excited for it!</p> \n     <p>I did want to address a couple of points\
  \ that we heard from the community in response to the announcement, which was a\
  \ request for additional replay options as well as an update to the rewards given\
  \ out by some of our sanctioned Adventures. To the replays, I know this has been\
  \ a widely-requested option, and we’re working with tech on how we can best make\
  \ the system work with the desire to replay adventures for credit. This will be\
  \ a longer-term project, but we will keep you posted as we have news, it’s definitely\
  \ something I want to see happen as much as the community. For the sanctioned content\
  \ rewards, we’re finishing up an audit to update some of the rewards for older adventures\
  \ and make sure everything is working the same going forward. Stay tuned for news\
  \ on that front very soon!</p> \n     <p>Finally, one thing that I don’t want to\
  \ get lost: with the release of our newest Humble Bundle, featuring <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy9zkn?Starfinder-Pact-Worlds\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Pact Worlds</em></a> and the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/starfinder/beginnerbox\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Beginner Box</em></a> at the physical tier, we’re excited to let\
  \ you know that we’ve sanctioned the adventure in the Beginner Box, Steel Talon’\
  s Lair! You can find the sanctioning on the product page; it awards one scenario’\
  s worth of XP and credits, along with <b>double the Achievement Points</b>, to encourage\
  \ you all to give the simplified rules of my favorite science-fantasy universe a\
  \ shot. (OPM Note: The <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq026dl?Pathfinder-Beginner-Box\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Beginner Box</em></a> also awards <b>double the Achievement Points</b>).</p>\

  \ \n     <p>On Monday, the <a href=\"http://starfinderplaytest.com/\">playtest for\
  \ the new evolutionist class</a> began. This playtest is legal for games that take\
  \ place during the playtest period, using the <a href=\"https://organizedplayfoundation.org/Lorespire/sfsguide._.Playtest-Rules\"\
  >rules in the Guide to Organized Play</a>. Play-by-post games may use these rules\
  \ as long as the game begins prior to the conclusion of the playtest, though keep\
  \ in mind that the playtest survey will close on September 24th. After the playtest\
  \ concludes, evolutionist characters may not be played until the final publication\
  \ of the class. We look forward to seeing the new agents in the field!</p> \n  \
  \   <h2>Sanctioning</h2> \n     <p>With a big month of releases comes an equally\
  \ large month of sanctioning! This month, <a href=\"https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/characteroptions\"\
  >we sanctioned the options</a> from <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq027ot?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-The-Mwangi-Expanse\"\
  ><em>Lost Omens: The Mwangi Expanse</em></a>, as well as the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/fistsOfTheRubyPhoenix\"\
  ><em>Fists of the Ruby Phoenix</em></a> AP and <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq027qf?Pathfinder-Adventure-Malevolence\"\
  ><em>Malevolence</em></a>. For Starfinder, we also got the rules options for the\
  \ <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq027ud?Starfinder-Galaxy-Exploration-Manual\"\
  ><em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em></a> and the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventures/adventurePath/flyFreeOrDie\"\
  ><em>Fly Free or Die</em> Adventure Path</a> onto the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/starfindersociety/characteroptions\"\
  >Character Options page</a>, as well as sanctioning the adventure included in the\
  \ <a href=\"https://paizo.com/starfinder/beginnerbox\"><em>Starfinder Beginner Box</em></a>.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Looking ahead, we’re starting work on <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq027uy?Pathfinder-Secrets-of-Magic\"\
  ><em>Secrets of Magic</em></a>, and working through the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventures/adventurePath/devastationArk\"\
  ><em>Devastation Ark</em> Adventure Path’s</a> options. On the horizon are <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/products/btq027kc?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-The-Grand-Bazaar\"><em>Lost\
  \ Omens: The Grand Bazaar</em></a> and <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq029vf?Starfinder-Adventure-Junkers-Delight\"\
  ><em>Junker’s Delight</em></a>, as well as the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/strengthOfThousands\"\
  ><em>Strength of Thousands</em></a> and <a href=\"https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventures/adventurePath/horizonsOfTheVast\"\
  ><em>Horizons of the Vast</em></a> Adventure Paths once more volumes of both are\
  \ released. </p> \n     <h2>GM Recognition</h2> \n     <p>At PAX Online, we awarded\
  \ a new Campaign Service Coin. These Coins are given to volunteers who go above\
  \ and beyond the typical volunteer duties to support their communities and Organized\
  \ Play. Nominations are always accepted; volunteers may be nominated by emailing\
  \ <a href=\"mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com\">organizedplay@paizo.com</a> with their\
  \ name, region and a description of their service. As we begin to return to physical\
  \ events, we hope to resume awarding these in-person, so letting us know what upcoming\
  \ events they’re attending is also useful.</p> \n     <p>Congratulations to <b>Betsy\
  \ Nold</b>, who now holds a Campaign Coin and Organized Play ID# <b>846</b>!</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program\
  \ involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the 5th milestone, a GM must\
  \ run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios,\
  \ as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains (program dependant).\
  \ A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th milestone is 650 hours!</p>\
  \ \n     <p>This month, one GM earned their 5th Star for Pathfinder Society (first\
  \ edition).</p> \n     <p><b>5th Star (PFS1)</b>: Tommi Ketonen</p> \n     <p>If\
  \ you believe you have achieved your 5th rank but haven’t been announced, email\
  \ us at <a href=\"mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com\">organizedplay@paizo.com</a>.</p>\
  \ \n     <h2>Upcoming Conventions</h2> \n     <p>Our remaining major conventions\
  \ are <a href=\"https://warhorn.net/events/paizocon-online-europe-2021\"><b>PaizoCon\
  \ Online Europe</b></a>, August 19-22, and <a href=\"https://www.gencon.com/online\"\
  ><b>Gen Con Online</b></a>, September 16-19. PaizoCon Online Europe’s player signups\
  \ are open now, and Gen Con Online registration will open August 15.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>Remember that you can always check out the list of upcoming events at the new\
  \ <a href=\"https://paizo.com/conventions\">Conventions calendar</a>!</p> \n   \
  \  <h2>Gen Con Online</h2> \n     <p>The Gen Con Online catalog opens tomorrow for\
  \ viewing and player registration begins at noon Eastern time on August 15. Paizo\
  \ has over 450 events listed for Pathfinder Society (both first and second edition),\
  \ Starfinder Society and the Pathfinder Adventure Card Society.</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ Gen Con Online badge is free; session prices this year are as follows:</p> \n\
  \     <ul> \n      <li>Two-hour Bounties and PACS sessions: $2</li> \n      <li>Five-hour\
  \ Scenarios: $4</li> \n      <li>PACS Interactive Special: $6</li> \n      <li>PFS2\
  \ and SFS Interactive Specials: $8</li> \n     </ul> \n     <p>Gen Con Online has\
  \ a minimum price of $2 per event, regardless of length. We added a bit more to\
  \ the longer/premium sessions. While online events do not have the same infrastructure\
  \ costs as physical shows, there are still associated expenses we need to cover.\
  \ Monies received from ticket sales at Gen Con help offset volunteer rewards, such\
  \ as GM vouchers and book rewards, and pay for Discord boosts to ensure server stability\
  \ during the event. We expect that when we return to Gen Con Indy, prices will be\
  \ set similarly based on their pricing structure. </p> \n     <p>We look forward\
  \ to player signups; if you have questions about our events, please email genconleads@gmail.com.\
  \ If you are interested in volunteering, visit the Organized Play Foundation <a\
  \ href=\"https://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/paizo/popvo/\" target=\"_blank\"\
  >volunteer opportunities page</a> for more information. </p> \n     <p>Until next\
  \ time, Explore! Report! Cooperate! And get ready for the Year of Shattered Sanctuaries!</p>\
