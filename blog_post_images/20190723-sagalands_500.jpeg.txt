| summary  = A glimpse of the Saga Lands. The city seems to be hewn of stone, with two fantastically gigantic statues guarding each side of this entrance. Each statue depicts a person holding a long, thin staff in one hand, the top of which has a kink in it. The other hand holds a large tablet close to the chest of the statue. They are mirror images of each other.
