  \ our promotion of the latest Lost Omens book, I reached out to the authors of the\
  \ book with the intent of promoting them—as well as any other personal work they\
  \ would like to promote, so that new fans of their work could find other projects,\
  \ RPG products, websites, livestreams, and more to enjoy!</p> \n     <p style=\"\

  \ Hey folks! I'm Mike Kimmel, and I've been writing for Paizo since 2014. The Pathfinder\
  \ Society program holds a special place in my heart, and it was an honor to contribute\
  \ to this book. I wrote about the Pathfinder Society in the <em>Lost Omens Character\
  \ Guide</em>, and I was able to expand on the various schools of the Society in\
  \ this book. As a teacher, it was fun to imagine what sorts of people one might\
  \ encounter in an institution like the Pathfinder Society, where an agent's training\
  \ and knowledge can mean the difference between life and death. I hope you enjoy\
  \ reading about them as much as I enjoyed writing about them! Keep an eye out for\
  \ my occasional Pathfinder or Starfinder Society scenario, and feel free to reach\
  \ out any time if you're interested in writing for RPGs yourself. I am the founder\
  \ of Freelance Forge, a forum for RPG freelancers. You can learn more at https://freelanceforge.boards.net/,\

  \ on the Pathfinder Adventure Path line here at Paizo. I wrote up Nexus House for\
  \ this book. I’ve become a big fan of Nex recently, having set a Pathfinder Society\
  \ scenario there as well as linking a few other projects to that magic-filled land.\
  \ Making the place feel truly magical was a lot of fun, as was fleshing out its\
  \ history and its very enthusiastic vash-vatom (or venture-captain). You can check\
  \ out my RPG advice, including an entire free Pathfinder Second Edition Adventure\
  \ Path I wrote, on my blog at RunAmokGames.com. I’m available for freelance for\
  \ any number of game systems at rules.lawyer.ron@gmail.com.</p> \n     <p><b>Dennis\
  \ Muldoon</b><br> Hello! I'm Dennis Muldoon, and I wrote the Pathfinder Gear and\
  \ Pathfinder Agent Feats sections of the <em>Pathfinder Society Guide</em>. The\
  \ Pathfinder Society is a huge part of my life as a gamer, and I have a lot of love\
  \ for the Society both in-world and as an organized play campaign. In addition to\
  \ being a freelance writer I'm a Venture Lieutenant and frequent GM for my local\
  \ Pathfinder Society lodge, and have written several adventures for Pathfinder Society\
  \ Organized play (<em>Quest #7: A Curious Claim</em>, and <em>PFS #2-00 King in\
  \ Thorns</em>). I'm excited to see a whole book focused on the Society, and I'm\
  \ thrilled to have been a part of bringing it to life. You can find more of my work\
  \ listed on my Paizo profile (https://paizo.com/people/DennisMuldoon), and can follow\
  \ me on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dkmuldoon\" target=\"_blank\">@dkmuldoon</a>.</p>\
  \ \n     <br clear=\"all\"> \n     <p><b>Michael Sayre</b><br> Yo! Michael Sayre\
  \ here, former PFS developer and now designer. Freelancing on this book was a lot\
  \ of fun for me. Some of my favorite characters, like Bjersig Torrsen from the Iceferry\
  \ Lodge and Narsen from the Exalted Lodge, got more screen time in a way that can\
  \ be hard to do in a scenario, so giving them a bit of a spotlight here was really\
  \ exciting. It was also a blast getting to deliver the rest of the Rain of Embers\
  \ feats and some cool mechanics to connect with characters like Stella Fane and\
  \ Marcos Farabellus. Feats that have a history in the game and carry the names of\
  \ characters who are part of the world are something that I’ve always loved to see\
  \ in RPGs, and I really enjoyed getting to bring them to this edition. At least\
  \ for the time being, this is probably my favorite Lost Omens book; I’ve even “\
  stolen” a lot of these characters and options and dropped them into my non-Golarion\
  \ home game!</p> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/d733586e-1643-4779-8302-25704b7e3fcc/102020_durvingest.jpgg\"\

  \ In <em>Lost Omens Pathfinder Society Guide</em>, I wrote the aeon stones, the\
  \ wayfinders, and then a grab bag section including the new specific familiars.\
  \ Normally because of the timelines of publishing, it wouldn't be feasible to use\
  \ the rules from a release as recent as Advanced Player's Guide in this product,\
  \ but as the creator of the specific familiar rules for that book, I made it work.\

  \ AM Pacific at <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/arcanemark\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.twitch.tv/arcanemark</a>.\
  \ We cover a variety of RPG and Pathfinder topics on Tuesdays and Saturdays, chosen\

  \ Linda Zayas-Palmer, Paizo's Organized Play Managing Developer. I joined the Pathfinder\
  \ Society OP campaign back in GenCon 2009 (wow, time files!) and became a Pathfinder\
  \ Society developer five years ago. Nowadays, I do development and logistics for\
  \ all three Organized Play programs.</p> \n     <p>I wrote several sections of this\
  \ new Lost Omens book, including the sections for the Horizon Hunters faction, the\
  \ Grand Lodge, and the Woodsedge Lodge, and I helped out with background research/canon\
  \ checking. Other than this book, which I'm super-excited to have been a part of,\
  \ the two projects I'm most proud of are the <em>Pathfinder Society Special #7-99:\
  \ Through Maelstrom Rift</em> and the fourth volume of the Age of Ashes Adventure\
  \ Path, <em>Fires of the Haunted City</em>. I'm also the cohost of the twitch stream\
  \ Arcane Mark along with fellow author Mark Seifter, which streams two new episodes\
