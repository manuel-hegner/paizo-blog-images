  >One of my favorite things about the upcoming <a href=\"/products/btpy909j\">Legends\
  \ of Golarion</a> set of <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids\">Pathfinder\
  \ Battles</a> prepainted plastic miniatures is that it gives us a chance to focus\
  \ on some creatures that are either original Pathfinder RPG creations or that came\
  \ from mythology but otherwise made their debut in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game.</span></p>\
  \ \n    <p>Let's take a look!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-Reefclaw_500_500.jpeg\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-Reefclaw_500_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Up first we have one of the most-demanded\
  \ figures ever, the Reefclaw! This Small aquatic monster features prominently in\
  \ the <a href=\"/products/btpy8osv\">Pathfinder RPG Beginner Box</a>, and with its\
  \ low Challenge Rating it makes a frequent enemy for low-level parties. We finally\
  \ had a chance to work it into a set, and since people want it so badly (and since\
  \ they often travel in groups), we decided to make it a common!</p> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-BeatificOne_500_500.jpeg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-BeatificOne_500_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Paizo started exploring Indian mythology\
  \ early with the nation of Jalmeray in the <a href=\"/products/btpy8ief\">Inner\
  \ Sea World Guide</a> and adventures like <a href=\"/products/btpy8ihu\">Cult of\
  \ the Ebon Destroyers</a>. The alluring Beatific One is inspired by the cover of\
  \ that latter Pathfinder Module, only here she's represented at her standard Medium\
  \ size. The Beatific One (also known as an upasunda asura in <a href=\"/products/btpy8odu\"\
  >Bestiary 3</a>) is a rare figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a\
  \ href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-Tatzlwyrm_500_500.jpeg\"><img\
  \ src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-Tatzlwyrm_500_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>The Tatzlwyrm, a creature from European mythology,\
  \ appeared as early as <a href=\"/products/btpy82r0\">Hollow's Last Hope</a>, which\
  \ was technically one of the very first modules ever published for what would become\
  \ the Pathfinder world. Since then they've cropped up in the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/kingmaker&quot;\"\
  >Kingmaker Adventure Path</a> and elsewhere, menacing low-level parties with its\
  \ poison gasp. The Tatzlwyrm also appears in <a href=\"/products/btpy8odu\">Bestiary\
  \ 3</a>, and we've slated it at the uncommon rarity.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-Moonbeast_500_500.jpeg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-Moonbeast_500_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Last up we have the Moon Beast, a creature that originally\
  \ appeared in author H. P. Lovecraft's haunting \"Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath\"\
  . That hardly qualifies it as a \"Paizo original,\" but since pretty much everyone\
  \ here adores Lovecraft's work and we smoosh his monsters into our stuff at any\
  \ opportunity, I'm counting it as one of ours for the time being. In any event,\
  \ this figure is really, really gross. This Large figure (also in <a href=\"/products/btpy8odu\"\
  >Bestiary 3</a>) is slated at the uncommon rarity.</p> \n    <p>That's it for this\
  \ week. Next week, look for preview photos of three new dragons from the just-announced\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy91sj\">Red Dragon Evolution</a> encounter pack, plus some\
  \ other fun surprises!</p> \n    <p>Until then,</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p>\
