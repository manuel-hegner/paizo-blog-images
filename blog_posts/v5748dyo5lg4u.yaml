  \ exciting announcement, the latest Pathfinder comic story arc, <a href=\"/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics/pfComicsVol3\"\
  >City of Secrets</a>, launched yesterday to a comics shop invasion! We're still\
  \ receiving isolated reports from far-flung Pathfidner agents that a few limited-edition\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy95c9\">Retailer Exclusive</a> issues are still available\
  \ among the brick and mortar retailers, but even if they aren't you can still secure\
  \ your own copy of the <a href=\"/products/btpy9474\">Paizo.com exclusive cover\
  \ variant</a> and not miss a moment.</span></p> \n    <p>Author Jim Zub was kind\
  \ enough to provide us with page-by-page story commentary, so you can follow along\
  \ with the creative process!</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><b>Page 1</b>: Starting\
  \ up a new story arc and a new issue #1, it's nice to get a brief reintroduction\
  \ to our adventuring heroes. Leandro does a wonderful job of illustrating the cast,\
  \ following the detailed style of the Pathfinder game very closely.</p> \n     <p><b>Page\
  \ 2-3</b>: A tough shot but Leandro pulls it off beautifully. The city of Magnimar\
  \ has really specific geography, a distinctive look and feel I wanted to make sure\
  \ was well established as the characters arrived in their new home. </p> \n    \
  \ <p>That huge ruined bridge in the background is the Irespan, a remnant of a much\
  \ earlier time. The shadow beneath that impressive monument is called, appropriately\
  \ enough, Underbridge and the Shadow District. That's where the poor and downtrodden\
  \ find themselves, as well as some of the more unsavory characters of Magnimar.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Having a small excerpt from the Pathfinder Chronicles at the start of\
  \ each issue is a useful way to fill in a bit of back story and give readers extra\
  \ appreciation for the depth and care the Paizo crew have put into designing their\
  \ fantasy world.</p> \n     <p><b>Page 4</b>: The group left Sandpoint at sunset\
  \ and, about 24 hours later, arrives in Magnimar at sunset as well.</p> \n     <p>Gauging\
  \ each of their reactions to the city was fun to put together.</p> \n     <p><b>Page\
  \ 5</b>: In the second story arc we started a relationship between Kyra, the Cleric,\
  \ and Merisiel, the Rogue. Readers have responded well to these two opposites coming\
  \ together and this story arc carries on that relationship, giving them some new\
  \ challenges to overcome.</p> \n     <p><b>Page 6</b>: Speaking of Kyra and Merisiel,\
  \ the two ladies got themselves into an overnight caper in our super-sized Pathfinder\
  \ Special and we tie into that here. It's a fun done-in-one story that deepens the\
  \ bond between the two of them.</p> \n     <p><b>Page 7</b>: When the group was\
  \ in Sandpoint or on the road Seoni had a clear understanding of how to lead them,\
  \ but now that they're in the city the group is pulled apart by their different\
  \ goals and responsibilities. If you've ever played a tabletop RPG this is actually\
  \ a pretty typical scenario. City encounters tend to involve lots of splitting up\
  \ and prep before the next big adventure. I wanted to reflect a bit of that and\
  \ show how varied everyone's approach is to their first day in Magnimar.</p> \n\
  \     <p><b>Page 8-11</b>: Ezren's age leads everyone to assume he has a great deal\
  \ of wisdom and experience, but the truth is that he's kind of a tragic figure.\
  \ He didn't start training and adventuring until quite recently and that lost time\
  \ weighs heavily on him. It's a feeling of inadequacy that he struggles with and\
  \ something I want to explore with him in this story arc.</p> \n     <p>Sheila Heidmarch\
  \ is a well known figure from the Pathfinder setting material. She's powerful, confident,\
  \ and beautiful â€“ an intimidating combination, especially to someone like Ezren.\
  \ Her capabilities reflect exactly how much time he wasted in his youth.</p> \n\
  \     <p><b>Page 12-13</b>: Unlike many dwarves, Harsk loathes the city. He hates\
  \ the hustle and bustle of city living and finds the social etiquette required to\
  \ coexist so close to so many other people frustrating and unnecessary. Writing\
  \ Harsk in the city was a challenge, but I like putting him out of his element.\
  \ Thankfully Alabastar Park is more his speed.</p> \n     <p><b>Page 14-15</b>:\
  \ Valeros was at the forefront of the action in our first story arc so it felt like\
  \ a good idea to have him ease back a bit here and let others push the plot forward.\
  \ Val's feeling a bit cocky after the group's previous successes and doesn't realize\
  \ that in many ways the city is even more dangerous than the open wilderness and\
  \ dungeons they've tackled before.</p> \n     <p><b>Page 16-17</b>: Kasadei arrives\
  \ and the plot thickens. Like our second story arc, this one uses material from\
  \ a Pathfinder adventure as a base structure to build our story from. In this case\
  \ it's a short adventure scenario called \"Dawn of the Scarlet Sun\" written by\
  \ James Jacobs. James and I chatted at Gen Con last year and came up with some fun\
  \ ways to incorporate material from that adventure in with my ongoing plans for\
  \ the evolution of the Pathfinder storyline.</p> \n     <p><b>Page 18</b>: Having\
  \ an ensemble cast of six main characters means that when the group splits up I\
  \ have to jump around quite a bit to make sure everyone gets enough \"air time\"\
  .</p> \n     <p>I like the contrast between Merisiel's \"Devil may care\" attitude\
  \ and Kyra's pious confidence. The two of them are so very different, but I think\
  \ that's why they make such a good couple. They teach each other about a life the\
  \ other has never lived and they're both stronger for it.</p> \n     <p><b>Page\
  \ 19</b>: Background info as someone spies on them from the shadows. Events have\
  \ taken place in Magnimar before our adventuring heroes arrived and other things\
  \ will happen once they leave. Giving an environment a sense of history is important\
  \ as it helps build that impression of a larger living fictional setting.</p> \n\
  \     <p><b>Page 20-21</b>: Faith can be a touchy subject, but I really like writing\
  \ Kyra because her faith in this fantasy world is so different than our own. In\
  \ the world of Golarion people know the gods exist because they have immediate proof.\
  \ Deities give their followers access to powerful magic and heed their prayers.\
  \ In that world it's not a matter of belief, it's more about choice. Do you choose\
  \ to follow a deity and look to them for guidance or do you strike out on your own?\
  \ Kyra and Merisiel embody those two extremes.</p> \n     <p><b>Page 22</b>: Merisiel\
  \ let her guard down as she was emotionally overwhelmed by the power of Kyra's prayers\
  \ and now they've got problems.</p> \n     <p>Even though there isn't any full blown\
  \ action this issue, there's an atmosphere of tension that runs through this first\
  \ chapter as we showcase each character and set pieces in motion, prepping everything\
  \ for the dangers ahead.</p> \n     <p>Who are these well-armed bandits and what\
  \ do they want with our adventuring pair? Read onto issue #2 and find out as Pathfinder:\
  \ City of Secrets continues with action and intrigue aplenty!</p> \n    </blockquote>\
  \ \n    <p>And don't forget that our <a href=\"/pathfinder/heroesOfMagnimar\">Heroes\
  \ of Magnimar contest</a><a></a> will be wrapping up soon! If you want your characters\
  \ to be enshrine in Golarion canon forever, head on over to our contest page and\
  \ learn how to submit!</p> \n   </div> \n  </blockquote> <!-- tags: Pathfinder Comics\
