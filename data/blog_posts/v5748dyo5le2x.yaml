  \ Time</h1> \n    <p>by Dave Gross</p> \n    <h2>Chapter Three: The Dead Prince<br><i>Varian</i></h2>\
  \ \n    <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n     <p>The intruder stepped out of the\
  \ shadows. I stood, shocked by several simultaneous realizations.</p> \n     <p>Foremost\
  \ was that he had employed magic to read my thoughts, thus causing my momentary\
  \ dizziness and his echoing of my unspoken notion. My irritation with the Decemvirate\
  \ paled in comparison to my outrage at the violation.</p> \n     <p>\"You will never\
  \ guess who I am.\" The intruder's voice was a sneer behind his golden mask.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><span itemprop=\"description\">Locking my gaze to his jaundiced eyes,\
  \ I made a silent inventory of my weapons: riffle scrolls before me, the Shadowless\
  \ Sword at my hip, and Arnisant at my feet. Yet for the moment, my most powerful\
  \ weapon might be a sharp tongue. \"Prince Kasiya of Osirion.\"</span></p> \n  \
  \   <p>He choked. \"How—?\"</p> \n     <p>\"You wear the funereal garb of the royal\
  \ family of Osirion, with the addition of a few rather gaudy accessories.\" The\
  \ latter caught my interest: the miniature chariot had to be a magical conveyance,\
  \ and by the durable bindings—one crocodile hide, the other the skin of a large\
  \ blue-skinned reptile—I inferred Kasiya's books contained arcana or similarly rare\
  \ material. To my knowledge, Kasiya had not been a spellcaster when we last met.\
  \ Of course, to his knowledge, neither had I.</p> \n     <p>\"So my attire made\
  \ it all too easy for you to guess my mortal identity. Still, you can hardly deduce\
  \ the nature of my incredible return from death and entomb—\"</p> \n     <p>\"Vampire.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"How could you possibly—?\"</p> \n     <p>\"You are smothered in\
  \ the traditional burial ointments and herbs, yet not of sufficient quantity to\
  \ disguise the stench of a ghoul or ghast. You are obviously tangible, so you cannot\
  \ be a spectre, wraith, or ghost. You speak articulately, so your mental functions\
  \ are no worse than they were in life. And let us be frank, Kasiya: You were never\
  \ lich material.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Prince Kasiya!\" he sputtered, bloody flecks\
  \ forming around the rim of his mask's mouth. He struck the table with such force\
  \ that he left the impression of his fist in the mahogany. \"You will address me\
  \ as 'Your Highness.'\"</p> \n     <p>As he raged, I slipped a pair of riffle scrolls\
  \ into my coat pockets. I did the same again and put a third pair in my hands before\
  \ he regained his composure. </p> \n     <p>\"You are no longer a prince, Kasiya.\
  \ You are a corpse, a carcass, a cadaver—a casing of dead flesh. You have sunk lower\
  \ than the grave, become more common than dust. 'Kasiya' is too much name for you.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"You, a mere count, dare speak to me with such insolence? You should\
  \ bow to the ground and grovel for mercy, for I have bided my time for decades,\
  \ mastered the arts arcane, plotted every calculation for the singular purpose of—\
  \"</p> \n     <p>\"Revenge.\" I yawned into my palm, holding the riffle scroll between\
  \ my fingers like one of those loathsome cigars with which Radovan used to annoy\
  \ me. It was, I thought, a rather good semblance of nonchalance—so long as Kasiya\
  \ did not notice the trembling of my fingers. \"Vengeance is the common motivation\
  \ for your ilk.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Again you say 'common'!?\" Kasiya sputtered. \"\
  And my ilk?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Vampires are as susceptible to pride as... well, as\
  \ susceptible as princes. Dead ones.\"</p> \n     <p>Kasiya raised a bandaged hand\
  \ to trace a symbol in the air. I recognized the gesture as the beginning of an\
  \ incendiary invocation. As he cupped his hands around a growing spark, I dropped\
  \ a riffle scroll and snatched another from my pocket. Its pages snapped across\
  \ my thumb. I felt the arcane tingling of my counterspell wash away his nascent\
  \ fireball.</p> \n     <p>\"Not in the library,\" I admonished him. While he glowered,\
  \ I dropped the expended scroll and slipped another into my hand. \"After all, you\
  \ too were a Pathfinder, once.\"</p> \n     <p>Kasiya's halting breath gurgled and\
  \ broke into such a repugnant sound that it took me a moment to recognize it as\
  \ laughter. \"You hide your fear well. I had forgotten that you too enjoy some excess\
  \ of pride.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Honor.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Semantics.\"</p> \n     <p>His\
  \ words struck like a dash of cold water. Either Kasiya had been spying on me for\
  \ hours, or else— </p> \n     <p>No, I refused to believe my artless Osirian nemesis\
  \ had gulled me with an impersonation of a member of the inner circle. Besides,\
  \ it was inconceivable that a vampire could infiltrate the Decemvirate. Or so I\
  \ prayed.</p> \n     <p>\"You mentioned revenge,\" said Kasiya, rising confidence\
  \ in his voice. \"Tell me, Chelaxian, what in your infernal empire is a fit punishment\
  \ for a man who betrays a prince and leaves him for dead?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Your\
  \ implied accusation is false on both counts.\"</p> \n     <p>\"How do you mean\
  \ 'false'?\"</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb360\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Kasiya.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Kasiya_360.jpeg\" border=\"0\"\
  ></a>\n      <br> Kasiya's mask cannot hide the horror he's become.\n     </div>\
  \ \n     <p>\"First, I did not leave you for dead; you were in fact dead. Second,\
  \ I did not leave your remains; I returned them to your royal brother, whose noble\
  \ hospitality I repaid by withholding the true account of your treachery.\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Enough,\" said Kasyia. \"It is time to make you suffer.\"</p> \n \
  \    <p>\"In that you have already succeeded with your tiresome posturing.\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Kasiya lifted the blue-bound book hanging from his girdle. He twisted\
  \ open the latch and revealed the contents. In an instant I recognized the weird\
  \ writing and detestable illustrations.</p> \n     <p>\"The Lacuna Codex!\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Ah!\" Humor returned to Kasiya's sepulchral voice. \"At last I surprise\
  \ you.\"</p> \n     <p>In the hands of a powerful wizard, the rituals contained\
  \ in the Lacuna Codex could alter the course of history. They were weapons so dreadful\
  \ that the last prince of Ustalav hesitated to unleash its powers, perishing at\
  \ the hands of Tar-Baphon before the hero Arnisant finally sacrificed himself to\
  \ imprison the Whispering Tyrant. After recovering the Codex from that prince's\
  \ tomb, I entrusted it to the Decemvirate.</p> \n     <p>And now Kasiya had it.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"What do you think of me now, Count Jeggare? With such power in my\
  \ grasp, do I still amuse you?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Read me a bit.\"</p> \n     <p>\"\
  What?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Anywhere will do. Perhaps that caption under that rather\
  \ disgusting illustration.\"</p> \n     <p>\"You test my patience.\"</p> \n    \
  \ <p>\"Surely you can read ancient Thassilonian,\" I said. \"If not, this tome is\
  \ of no more use to you than to a blind beggar.\" </p> \n     <p>I raised a riffle\
  \ scroll, but before I could place my thumb upon its edge, Kasiya leaped over the\
  \ table and struck me full on the chest.</p> \n     <p>His icy hand pressed down\
  \ upon my heart. I slapped the golden mask from his face.</p> \n     <p>Where once\
  \ Kasiya's face had been a study in Osirian beauty, it was now a patchwork ruin.\
  \ The brown skin, once lustrous, now resembled a patch of moldering leaves through\
  \ which writhed livid worms. His teeth floated in his lumpish jaws, irregular except\
  \ for the prominent fangs peculiar to blood-drinkers. As I watched, his crooked\
  \ nose wriggled back into place after my strike had flattened it against his cheek.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Kasiya lashed out again, tearing open my shirt. There on my chest lay\
  \ the outline of his hand, white fading to the natural hue of my flesh.</p> \n \
  \    <p>\"You life essence should be mine. How—?\"</p> \n     <p>I had an inkling\
  \ of the answer, but the time for badinage had passed. \"Arnisant!\"</p> \n    \
  \ <p>The hound did not stir from his place near my feet. For an instant I felt the\
  \ panic of imagining he were dead, but his chest moved, and I heard the steady groan\
  \ of his snore.</p> \n     <p>Kasiya let out another horrid gurgle. \"Your pet will\
  \ not wake until you are dead. When I have finished with you, I shall let him dine\
  \ on your corpse.\"</p> \n     <p>I snapped a riffle scroll. Kasiya drew an eldritch\
  \ sign to ward off my spell, but I had not aimed at him.</p> \n     <p>My magic\
  \ peeled away the enchantment that kept Arnisant asleep. I pointed at Kasiya. \"\
  Arnisant, hands!\"</p> \n     <p>With a scrabble of claws on the floor, Arnisant\
  \ leaped. Kasiya grasped the hilt of his khopesh while fending off the dog with\
  \ his empty hand. He shouted and drew back the hand, one finger short.</p> \n  \
  \   <p>Kasiya slashed his khopesh toward Arnisant. The blade missed, but he pummeled\
  \ the hound with the weapon's butt. Arnisant fell back, choking on the putrescent\
  \ finger. He coughed it up, and the gray appendage dissolved into slime on the floor.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>I dropped the expended scroll and drew the Shadowless Sword, thrusting\
  \ at Kasiya's exposed face.</p> \n     <p>He fell back with inhuman speed, yet my\
  \ swift blade scratched his cheek. Black ooze welled up on his mottled skin.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>I struck again. He grabbed at my blade, but I withdrew before he could\
  \ capture it in his unholy grip.</p> \n     <p>Kasiya retreated, but only one step.\
  \ He whirled the khopesh above his head, bringing it down in a blinding arc. I stepped\
  \ back scarcely in time to avoid destruction. The heavy blade splintered my chair.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>I unleashed another riffle scroll. Its magic tingled through my sinews.\
  \ Poised for another attack, Arnisant uttered a querulous whuffle as he felt the\
  \ spell affect him too.</p> \n     <p>Kasiya flew toward us, but now Arnisant and\
  \ I matched him in alacrity. The vampire's sword struck empty air where I had stood\
  \ an instant earlier. Arnisant blurred behind Kasiya, harrying his heels.</p> \n\
  \     <p>I circled the table, attacking Kasiya's exposed face at every opportunity.\
  \ His parries struck hard against my blade, but they were hasty—he still feared\
  \ attacks to his face and eyes. He feinted a leap onto the table but turned instead\
  \ to cut at Arnisant.</p> \n     <p>\"Arnisant, out!\" Kasiya's blade scored a shallow\
  \ cut across the hound's hip as Arnisant ran back. I stabbed deep into Kasiya's\
  \ ham. His lunge faltered, but he staggered forward, recovering as abominable energies\
  \ repaired his severed ligaments.</p> \n     <p>I pressed the attack. Kasiya retreated\
  \ into the library stacks. With his free hand, he swept books from the shelves.\
  \ They crashed over me, the dust of decades blinding me.</p> \n     <p>The creaking\
  \ of a high shelf alerted me to the danger I could no longer see. Pushing books\
  \ through the nearest shelf, I snaked through the towering stack even as it fell\
  \ upon its neighbor. The massive shelves cascaded one against the other as I rolled\
  \ back toward the tables at the center of the room. I turned to witness the ruin\
  \ of the windows as the last stack fell against them, shattering the stained glass.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Beyond the broken window, the pink of dawn colored the eastern sky.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>I repressed the impulse to taunt Kasiya. He still had time to kill me,\
  \ if I were careless. Taking another riffle scroll in hand, I watched the open window,\
  \ ready to slow his escape with a frost spell. Nothing moved above the roiling dust.\
  \ Instead, I heard a crackle of flames from the direction of the door.</p> \n  \
  \   <p>Kasiya released the fireball. As it flew toward me, it grew from the size\
  \ of a pea to the circumference of a pumpkin. I leaped for Arnisant, trying to knock\
  \ the dog flat on the floor.</p> \n     <p>The blast swept us both across the room.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>My head rang with the explosion of dust. Burning pages flapped around\
  \ us like fiery birds landing on a charred beach. </p> \n     <p>Kasiya stood before\
  \ the door, unperturbed by the explosion. Retrieving his mask, he favored me with\
  \ an ugly, eel-like smile. \"This is the first of your punishments, Count Jeggare.\
  \ Do not dare to hope that it shall be the last.\"</p> \n     <p>As he spoke, his\
  \ features melted. So too did his flesh and garments, dissolving into a greasy cloud\
  \ that seeped beneath the crack of the repository door.</p> \n     <p>Scrabbling\
  \ to my feet, I grabbed the door handle and pulled. Locked.</p> \n     <p>Heedless\
  \ of the flames rising around me, I collected my satchel and as many of the materials\
  \ as I could find in the wreckage of the table. Happily, the scroll I required was\
  \ one of those I recovered in the debris. I discharged its magic to open the door\
  \ and stepped out of the smothering smoke into the cool air of dawn.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>The hue of \"Fire!\" rang across the grounds of the Grand Lodge. Servants and\
  \ Pathfinders poured out of the nearest buildings. A few lugged buckets, demonstrating\
  \ the efficiency with which they had learned the menial lessons taught to burgeoning\
  \ Pathfinders—lessons that I, by virtue of my noble birth, had been spared.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Venture-Captain, you are injured.\" Timon thrust his bucket into the\
  \ arms of another man and produced a handkerchief to press against my temple. By\
  \ his fearful grimace, I saw he was glad of any excuse not to approach the inferno.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>I took the handkerchief, grateful for the gesture but uncomfortable\
  \ at the touch of a servant.</p> \n     <p>A Pathfinder, I reminded myself. Timon\
  \ was not always a servant. I shuddered to imagine myself set down so low, a humiliation\
  \ I had experienced recently. A growing light from the sky arrested my attention.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Another fireball fell toward us. Illuminated in its glow, Kasiya rode\
  \ upon his now full-sized chariot, drawn by a pack of flying saluki dogs. Beside\
  \ me, Timon gasped but stood paralyzed by fear.</p> \n     <p>Frantic, I fumbled\
  \ with my satchel, eyes searching for the right scroll. My fingers found it, my\
  \ thumb pressing against its unbound edge, and the blaze engulfed me.</p> \n   \
