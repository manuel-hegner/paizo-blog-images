  \ Gaming and queer experiences have always been tightly tied for me. After all,\
  \ I've chosen to focus on the intersections of queer theory and gaming in my scholarship\
  \ for a reason. RPGs offer possibility. Play is a way to try on new identities and\
  \ explore areas of myself that I don't explore otherwise. Play has served as testing\
  \ ground for me to decide what was and wasn't safe to disclose. I've found benefit\
  \ in the failures I've experienced in RPGs. I learned what gender expressions didn't\
  \ feel right for me through exploration in RPGs. These failed attempts at creating\
  \ fantasized versions of myself helped me learn more about who I was and who I wanted\
  \ to be. RPGs, particularly Pathfinder, offered me the opportunity of endless, unquestioned\
  \ exploration. Without this, I wouldn't have been able to find a space for me that\
  \ exists outside of the hegemonic gender categories we're placed into.</p> \n  \
  \    <p>Since coming out publicly as nonbinary two years ago, I've found my role\
  \ in my local gaming community a way to both educate others and provide support\
  \ to other trans people. While I'll never claim that gaming alone can save us, it's\
  \ important to me to ensure gaming communities are just. As a Venture-Captain, I've\
  \ used my own standing in the community to create a more welcoming environment.\
  \ As a result, I've had several members of my local area's organized play community\
  \ feel safe enough to come out as trans. They've said that watching me live openly\
  \ as trans made them see transition as a possibility for their own life. While being\
  \ one of the first visible trans members of this community has come with rough spots,\
  \ knowing that my visibility makes it possible for other people to be themselves\
  \ has made all the challenges worthwhile.</p> \n      <p><b>Crystal Frasier, Author</b>:\
  \ Tabletop gaming was an important support for me when I was young and lonely and\
  \ hurt by the world. I hated myself a lot back then, and RPGs gave me a brief few\
  \ hours to not be myself and be someone I liked instead. In retrospect, it was pretty\
  \ hilarious that the only times I felt like I wasn't pretending to be someone else\
  \ were when I was pretending to be an elf or a superhero or a grizzled, postapocalyptic\
  \ powersuit pilot. Now that I like myself and don't feel a need to hide, I draw\
  \ on those same experiences of isolation, alienation, desperation, drive, and triumph\
  \ to help inform my writing. While the circumstances of transitioning are unique\
  \ to transgender and some intersex people, those emotions and experiences behind\
  \ it are universal and powerful.</p> \n      <p><b>Melissa Guillet, Systems Administrator</b>:\
  \ I first began playing tabletop games in earnest shortly after 2nd edition AD&amp;D\
  \ came out back in 1991. I worked in the local small-town bookstore, and I met the\
  \ man who would be my GM when he ordered the new books through us. He told me that\
  \ I could play once I reached sixteen, and so when I passed my driver's test, I\
  \ joined his group. I played with that group for about 15 years. They were mostly\
  \ Army/Air Force guys, and they were my best friends who saw me through high school\
  \ and a lot of other transitions in my life. I had a hard time at about nineteen\
  \ when I was trying to figure out how I was going to make this all work, being poor\
  \ and stuck in a small town in the Southwest. I hermitted away, and my gaming friends\
  \ were the ones that came around, got me out of the house, and told me that whatever\
  \ was the deal, they'd be okay with me. I didn't tell them during that time, but\
  \ their kindness did put me at ease. That's when I began exploring more feminine\
  \ aspects of myself in game; I started playing more and more women characters. One\
  \ day, some friends asked me why I was starting to play more female characters all\
  \ of a sudden. I played coy at first but couldn't quite bring myself to tell them—\
  not yet. My best friend in the group, who was basically a brother to me, deserved\
  \ to know first. If I could tell him and he would be okay with it, then, well, everything\
  \ else would be okay. This was way back in the late 90s, I think, so things were\
  \ quite a bit different. I wrote a letter and drove to his house and gave it to\
  \ him, and then I sat in his living room while he read through the pages. I poured\
  \ my heart out, and he told me that, no matter what, he'd always be there for me.\
  \ And then one by one, I told my gaming friends. Not everyone was immediately supportive,\
  \ but they all cared and loved me, and that was about as powerful a story for gaming\
  \ and togetherness as I can make. Gaming meant having the support of people who\
  \ loved me and wanted the best for me. So this story goes out to Gerald, Ben, Wade,\
  \ Lanell, Mark, Keith, and some guy named GM (he's really named JD). I miss you\
  \ guys. Thanks for being a powerful force in my life.</p> \n      <p><b>Sasha Lindley\
  \ Hall, Venture-Agent</b>: I feel that one of the biggest intersections between\
  \ my gender identity and my love of gaming is in how I approach the details. Both\
  \ of them are constantly evolving and changing and moving forward; as our understanding\
  \ of gender and ability to extend our ideas grows, in parallel are the supposed\
  \ limits of gaming (mechanically and culturally, both in game and out) pushed and\
  \ discarded. At their core, gaming and gender are about freedom to me—the freedom\
  \ to explore beyond myself and within myself. With them as prominent driving forces\
  \ in my life, I am growing better every day.</p> \n      <p><b>Violet Hargrave,\
  \ Author</b>: While there were obvious-in-retrospect signs all throughout my life,\
  \ what really made it click that I was trans was playing Pathfinder. I used to alternate\
  \ playing men and women \"for variety\" until it sank in that all the women were\
  \ fully fleshed-out characters I was really at ease inhabiting, while the men were\
  \ all slight, shy, and weirdly prone to amassing magical and nonmagical disguises\
  \ \"just in case.\" Once you articulate to yourself, \"I'm always a lot more comfortable\
  \ as a woman,\" it's a lot easier to realize that it applies to more than just RPGs.</p>\
  \ \n      <p><b>Isabelle Lee, Author</b>: For me, roleplaying games and my trans\
  \ identity are very closely linked. Gaming has been an outlet for that part of me\
  \ for as long as I can remember, allowing me to experience the idea of life as a\
  \ woman before I even knew I needed it and introducing me to the possibility of\
  \ leaving one's assigned gender behind, while my transition has inspired a few of\
  \ my creations in my time as a contributor. Accepting my gender identity gave me\
  \ the confidence to decide that I wanted to be part of this game and this industry,\
  \ and the friends I've made in the process (both of transitioning and of writing\
  \ for Pathfinder) have enriched my life more than I can describe. I know I've been\
  \ an inspiration to people, as both a writer and a trans woman, and I hope to keep\
  \ on being one for a long time to come. ^_^</p> \n      <p><b>Jen McTeague, Author</b>:\
  \ Pathfinder was a large part of how I explored being trans in the first place.\
  \ Komana Higgenstrom was my first female Pathfinder character, and I really enjoyed\
  \ playing her more than the vast majority of my other characters. I didn't quite\
  \ understand why at the time. After all, it would still be a year or two before\
  \ I realized that I was trans. But when I started to question my gender and look\
  \ back in my past for signs, those game sessions where I played Komana were a major\
  \ clue that I was headed on the right track.</p> \n      <p>Nowadays, my trans identity\
  \ affects a lot about how I play PFS. Since coming out, I've met a bunch of trans\
  \ PFS players, and we've been supporting each other. In addition, while I'm no longer\
  \ a VO, I still try to make the communities I'm a part of more friendly to trans\
  \ people. This includes both talking with other organizers and pushing back against\
  \ unfortunate words that are said at the table. After all, I had the great opportunity\
  \ to use PFS as a jumping point for my transition, and I want other people to have\
  \ the same opportunity.</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>Please join us in celebrating\
