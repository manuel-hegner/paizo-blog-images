  \ \n   <p>There are always interesting things taking place in the Pathfinder Society.\
  \ Take, for example, this message that has been sent out to Pathfinders across Golarion...\

  \     </center>\n    </div> \n    <p>Pathfinder,</p> \n    <p>We hope this message\
  \ finds you in good health, wherever you are operating from.</p> \n    <p>This year\
  \ has seen the Society endure many hardships alongside equal victories. Our achievements\
  \ in the Ruby Phoenix Tournament have not gone unrewarded, and even now, agents\
  \ like you are taking on dangerous journeys as a result of our spoils. As these\
  \ missions come to an end, we look to the new year as new opportunities and challenges\
  \ face the Pathfinder Society.</p> \n    <p>In preparation, we invite you, our most\
  \ prized agents, to attend this year’s Grand Convocation. As it takes place on the\
  \ grounds of the Grand Lodge in Absalom, you should all know of our yearly gathering.\
  \ It is here where the best of our agents come to trade tales of their exploits,\
  \ partake in feats of strength, knowledge, and guile, or even venture off the grounds\
  \ and take part in specialty missions on our behalf.</p> \n    <p>Though it has\
  \ not yet been made public knowledge, we also wish to keep you apprised of a recent\
  \ development here in Absalom. A member of the esteemed Blakros family, Michellia\
  \ Blakros, requested the hand of Andoran Major Colson Maldris in marriage. As many\
  \ of you may be aware, while not a member of the Society, Major Maldris is a sponsor\
  \ of many Pathfinders and a great ally of our organization. As a complication, the\
  \ major has opted to reject Michellia’s proposition, unwilling to surrender his\
  \ name and rank as would be required.</p> \n    <div style=\"float: right; padding:\
  \ 0 0 .5em .5em; width: 90px;\">\n     <center>\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PZOPSS-Guaril.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n      <br><span class=\"tiny\"><i>Guaril Karela—Sczarni Faction Leader</i></span>\n\
  \     </center>\n    </div> \n    <p>The actions of Major Maldris have had dire\
  \ consequences for our relations with the Blakros family. The Decemvirate agrees\
  \ that this divide must be mended, and as such we have taken the unique step of\
  \ inviting the Blakros family to this year’s convocation. It is our hope that Pathfinders\
  \ such as you will attend this year’s gathering and assist the Society in mending\
  \ this potentially disastrous divide between our organization and the Blakros family.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>As always, your continued efforts are appreciated.</p> \n    <br> \n\

  \   </blockquote> \n   <br> \n   <p>Clearly the other factions are already looking\
  \ to capitalize on Major Maldris’s rejection of a Blakros offer, so this is gearing\
  \ up to be a Grand Convocation to remember at both <a href=\"/paizocon\">PaizoCon</a>\
  \ and PaizoCon UK!</p> \n   <p>If you’re interested in attending the event, make\
  \ sure you’re registered for PaizoCon 2012 or Paizo Con UK 2012! Registration is\
  \ coming soon and we plan on keeping Pathfinders (both those in attendance and those\
  \ off on assignment) up to date on all information up to and following the event.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>For Pathfinders looking to research all the related backstory to this\
  \ year’s convocation, it would be best to read up on the effects of <a href=\"/products/btpy8530\"\
  >strange monkey idols</a>, <a href=\"/products/btpy8n0m\">ancient curses left by\
  \ astronomers</a>, and <a href=\"/products/btpy8h6n\">why contracts are important</a>.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>So, to sum it all up:</p> \n   <p>The Grand Convocation is a yearly gathering\
  \ held by the Pathfinder Society to bring together the best of Pathfinders from\
  \ across the globe. Taking place on the grounds of the Grand Lodge in Absalom, the\
  \ convocation is an event where Pathfinders can get together and exchange tales,\
  \ take part in feats of strength and guile, or be recruited for specialized missions.\
  \ This year, the event is being honored by the presence of the esteemed Blakros\
  \ family as well as various other prestigious people from across the Inner Sea,\
  \ promising to be a convocation to remember!</p> \n   <p>Expect to see the following:</p>\
  \ \n   <ul>\n    <li>Tailored Quests (45-minute to 1.5-hour mini-scenarios)</li>\
  \ \n    <li>Special Side Events (approximately 15 minutes per event)</li> \n   \
  \ <li>Pathfinder Social (A place for people to take part in live-action events)</li>\
  \ \n    <li>Faction Objectives</li> \n    <li>And more!</li>\n   </ul> \n   <p>The\
  \ PaizoCon Grand Convocation 2012 is a Pathfinder Special open to characters of\
  \ all levels—including those retired characters of 12th level or higher—that will\
  \ have a direct influence on certain plot points of Season 4, the Year of the Risen\
  \ Rune.</p> \n   <p>Mike Brock<br> <i>Pathfinder Society Campaign Coordinator</i></p>\
