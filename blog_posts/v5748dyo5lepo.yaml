  >We move from our last international blog in Ireland to a relatively new PFS lodge\
  \ in Portugal. It was one of the countries that was not currently in the PFS fold\
  \ and that I had targeted last year, especially after it was announced Paizo was\
  \ looking to have Pathfinder Roleplaying Game published in Portuguese. I was extrememly\
  \ lucky to find the awesome and talented Raul Moura da Silva that wanted to expose\
  \ Portugal to Pathfinder Society and was motivated to spread it across the entire\
  \ country.</span></p> \n    <p>Without further delay, I present to you Raul’s report\
  \ on Pathfinder Society in Portugal.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>Hello! I'm\
  \ Raul da Silva, and I am the Venture-Captain for Portugal. I currently live in\
  \ Porto. Helping me in the task of taking PFS to all corners of our country, I have\
  \ two Venture-Lieutenants, Bruno Tamames in Porto, and Bruno Sequeira in Lisboa,\
  \ along with a dedicated crew of nine GMs divided between both cities. We are a\
  \ constantly growing group of gamers and are full of dedication.</p> \n     <p>First,\
  \ I want to send a word of thanks must be given to those few, but helpful stores\
  \ that help us make our community grow and thrive. These include Mundo Fantasma\
  \ Porto, Kult Games Lisboa, Diver Coimbra, and our \"unofficial sponsor\" and regular\
  \ venue, Tropical Burger Crystal Park Porto.</p> \n     <p>Next, I want to offer\
  \ a few words for those of you who don't know about Portugal. Portuguese sailors\
  \ were, the first true real Pathfinders of our World, at least exploration wise.\
  \ They set sail for unknown lands and bravely charted the way for all that came\
  \ after them in the 15th Century. The great Portuguese poet (and possibly Pathfinder\
  \ Agent), Luis Vaz de Camões, wrote, \"They made maps and revolutionized the way\
  \ everyone sailed, and despite some errors in how they dealt with natives, brought\
  \ almost all the continents together.\" Unfortunately, that proud and visionary\
  \ past was lost through the ages, and despite still being one of the most friendly\
  \ countries in the world, with wonderful people, food,weather and landscapes, is\
  \ currently facing a serious financial crisis. This crisis, is also a big problem\
  \ for the expansion of Pathfinder RPG in our country, both for hobby stores who\
  \ are closing and/or afraid to invest in anything but card games, as well as players\
  \ who lack the money to buy material.</p> \n     <p>Nevertheless, we at Portugal\
  \ PFS are fighting against this!</p> \n     <p>The profile of the gaming community\
  \ in Portugal, a country with a high level of education among the younger generations,\
  \ the English language is almost a second natural language, with most of us speaking\
  \ it or at least understanding it easily . This helps a lot when we are talking\
  \ about RPG games in general, and Pathfinder in particular. Despite not having a\
  \ lot of stores that sell RPG and boardgame materials, there are a few stores we\
  \ are able to order from, and it's relatively cheap and fast to order online from\
  \ outside of Portugal.</p> \n     <p>Traditionally there is a strong presence in\
  \ our country of boardgaming players (mainly European style games), who organize\
  \ big conventions across the country, and it's from this big community that most\
  \ of our players comes from. We do have others joining us because due to their computer\
  \ RPG games experience and knowledge. Fortunately, there is a growing and prolific\
  \ RPG community across the country, playing mostly home games, but is very well\
  \ informed and plays all kinds of RPG games, including Pathfinder.</p> \n     <div\

  \ with four players coming together in the summer of 2009 in Porto and deciding\
  \ to organize a RPG gaming group to play regularly every week. We began at a local\
  \ gaming store and then moved to the local \"cultural gaming store\", Tropical Burger.\
  \ Thanks to their wise managers, it became the place where all the gaming groups\
  \ in the city—boardgamers, wargamers, roleplayers and card gamers—gather almost\
  \ every day of the week, at every hour of the day (the store is opened 23 hours\
  \ a day, 7 days a week). I was onne of those four initial players. The others included\
  \ Bruno Tamames, the local \"GM Guru\", who has been GMing for more than 20 years,\
  \ and André Silva, one of my current GMs. We were later joined by one of the most\
  \ reknown RPG enthusiast in the country, Rick \"Ricardo\" Danger, who helped us\
  \ found Roleplayers Porto, and we began advertising our group and gaming sessions\
  \ on internet sites and gaming stores. We established gaming days, events, and scheduling\
  \ in conventions . This helped create similar groups in other cities, like Lisboa,\
  \ where the players came together mainly at home. In the next few years, the Porto\
  \ community has grown to more than 30 regular players. We have been lucky enough\
  \ to have foreign players from Ireland, Scotland, Brazil, Estonia, and Russia come\
  \ join us at some of our game days.</p> \n     <p>The Porto gaming groups played\
  \ D&amp;D for the first years, but, there came a time in early 2012, when Bruno\
  \ Tamames and I started looking for something more appealing and challenging. We\
  \ found Pathfinder! We continued coordinating game days for almost a year, and then\
  \ in November 2012, Mike Brock sent us an email. After some questions about our\
  \ game days and events, he offered me the honor of being Venture-Captain for Portugal.\
  \ I had already registered some games but knew we needed a Venture-Captain to move\
  \ forward with growing Pathfinder Society. I accepted the position, and in December,\
  \ started scheduling regular public events in addition to our home games. This brought\
  \ players to Pathfinder RPG, and more precisely to Pathfinder Society. From that\
  \ moment on, my Venture-Lieutenant and I started advertising more Pathfinder and\
  \ \"campaigning\" for Organized Play and it's advantage. We scheduled monthly public\
  \ events and smaller weekly events. We also started a <a href=\"http://facebook.com/PathfinderPortugal\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Facebook group</a> to advertise our gaming sessions that we\
  \ utilize for scheduling, news, and announcements. We created flyers and started\
  \ distributing them throughout the city and stores and worked in making a unique\
  \ graphic presentation for our group, that continues to be a constantly evolving\
  \ process. I want to send a quick thanks to the designer, and local GM, Filipe Jensen.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>We began our expansion across the country, first in Lisboa where we\
  \ found Bruno Sequeira. He is an \"old\" D&amp;D player who was looking for players\
  \ and helped in the founding a regular group to play. He also came onboard as a\
  \ Venture-Lieutenant and has been making doing excellent work in his region. He\
  \ has mentored new GMs and his hard work is paying off . We are gaining a lot of\
  \ new players.</p> \n     <p>We have a loyal group of players in Aveiro and we are\
  \ looking to add a Venture-Lieutenant there in the near future. We have also turned\
  \ our attention to Coimbra, where Ricardo Moreno and I have started a new regular\
  \ event. Currently, with only four full months of activity, we have more than 70\
  \ players registered in four cities. We have monthly and weekly events happening\
  \ regularly in Porto and Lisboa, suach as the monthly PFS RPG PORTO.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>Finally we look to the future. We have many ideas of what we want, and how\
  \ to do it, and we have high hopes everything with come together nicely. At the\
  \ top of our priorities is the increase of gaming sessions in more venues, especially\
  \ in Porto and Lisboa. Next, we are trying to schedule regular monthly events in\
  \ Coimbra and Aveiro, as well as a few other cities we have yet to explore, but\
  \ where we know other gaming groups exist. After that, we plan to try to reach new\
  \ markets, with more advertising, and some interviews in local blogs and local television\
  \ stations.</p> \n     <p>Also of note is the scheduled presence of Pathfinder Society\
  \ at the upcoming major national conventions (where we hope to lure Mike Brock to\
  \ one day), starting with this year’s Invictacon. It will be the first, officially\
  \ supported Pathfinder Society event in Portugal, and we will be making the season\
  \ finales a major event, for the current season, as well every season for the foreseeable\
  \ future. Lisboacon in 2014 will also feature special events and we will have registered\
  \ events in two other smaller conventions. These include Riacon next month and Leiriacon\
  \ in 2014.</p> \n     <p>Finally, we will continue to try and find more stores that\
  \ have interest in selling physical Pathfinder RPG books to showcase the awesome\
  \ things from our favorite game.</p> \n     <p>I cannot finish without thanking\
  \ Mike Brock and Paizo for their continued support.</p> \n     <p>If anyone is looking\
  \ for a place that has good and and inexpensive vacations, to include wonderful\
  \ food, weather and landscapes, consider Portugal. But, let us know ahead of time\
  \ because we'd love to have you over for a game!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
