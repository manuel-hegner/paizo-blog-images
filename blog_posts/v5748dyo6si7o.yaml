  \ </div> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Welcome to 2023\
  \ everyone! With the Second Edition of Pathfinder now in its third year, the folks\
  \ on the rules team are really thrilled to see how all of you are engaging with\
  \ the game and telling thrilling stories of adventure with friends and family. Behind\
  \ the scenes, we’re continuing to make the game as good as it possibly can be by\
  \ creating brand new content and going back to make sure that our existing books\
  \ are working the way we intended.</p> \n      <p>That means errata, and today we’\
  re happy to announce several exciting changes to the <em>Pathfinder Core Rulebook</em>\
  \ that make the game a little easier to play and bring certain aspects of it more\
  \ in line with our current thoughts and sensibilities. But before I toss the blog\
  \ over to Lead Designer Logan Bonner to walk you through some of the highlights,\
  \ I want to take a moment to talk about some upcoming changes to the errata process\
  \ itself!</p> \n      <p>In the past, our errata process has been tied to when we\
  \ reprint books, so that you could make sure your print edition matched what was\
  \ currently on store shelves. While this had its advantages, it often meant that\
  \ changes were made quite infrequently. In addition, if a book didn’t see a reprint,\
  \ it might mean that we never went in to apply a patch. The result was a process\
  \ that just was not living up to our needs and desire to make sure you have a great\
  \ game experience. So, we are changing the process.</p> \n      <p>Starting this\
  \ year, we will release errata twice per year, once in the spring and once in the\
  \ fall. Since errata will no longer be tied to reprints, it frees us up to cover\
  \ errata issues from a wide range of products as well. We hope this will allow us\
  \ to be a bit more responsive to your questions and any issues you might have spotted\
  \ with the game, so keep posting your questions to Paizo.com. Your passion helps\
  \ us make a better Pathfinder!</p> \n      <p>Alright, that’s enough process talk\
  \ from me. I’m going to toss it over to Logan to take a look at some of the changes\
  \ made to the <em>Pathfinder Core Rulebook</em>!</p> \n      <br> \n      <div class=\"\

  \ \n      <p>Thanks, Jason! You might notice that Jason said spring and fall, and\
  \ it’s not... either of those. This batch of errata is coming to coincide with the\
  \ new fourth printing of the <em>Core Rulebook</em>. While typically any such errata\
  \ will have already been covered under the new process, this one is playing catch-up.\
  \ You’ll find all the errata on the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/pathfinder/faq\"\
  >FAQ page</a>, but I want to give context and explanations for a few of the major\
  \ changes.</p> \n      <p>First comes the most expansive change: <b>alternate ancestry\
  \ boosts</b>. We’re implementing the option for you to choose two free ability boosts\
  \ for a character of <em>any</em> ancestry. There have been many ongoing conversations\
  \ in the gaming community and within Paizo about biological essentialism in RPGs.\
  \ We think it’s time to address this issue and have added this universal option.\
  \ This makes it clearer that ancestries aren’t a monolith, and adds more nuance\
  \ to the world and a wider breadth of characters. To be clear: this is an alternative\
  \ for all characters and campaigns, not a variant rule, since it’s expected to be\
  \ in line with the power level of other options. If you have made or want to make\
  \ a character using an ancestry’s printed options (such as a dwarf with a Con boost,\
  \ Wisdom boost, free boost, and Charisma flaw), those options remain, and those\
  \ characters still follow the updated rules. We started heading toward this adjustment\
  \ in July and are very pleased to have this chance to implement it and bring it\
  \ to the community!</p> \n      <p>The <b>alchemist</b> gets major changes to add\
  \ more flexibility. This dovetails with new alchemy options coming in <em>Treasure\
  \ Vault</em>, allowing more flexibility in choosing items for a research field instead\
  \ of a narrow list. The largest number of changes are with the chirurgeon. An alchemist\
  \ with this field can choose elixirs with the healing trait and can fully substitute\
  \ Crafting for Medicine checks and proficiency prerequisites. Now that they can\
  \ choose items that heal HP, we needed to add a limit for perpetual healing items\
  \ to keep out-of-combat healing from careening out of control. As with alternate\
  \ boosts, any alchemist you already made remains a valid character!</p> \n     \
  \ <p>Most of the remaining changes are smaller improvements, like fixing an oversight\
  \ on Simple Weapon Proficiency for clerics, making the horse animal companion work\
  \ as intended, and having the <em>soothe</em> spell target “1 willing creature,”\
  \ as suggested by <em>Book of the Dead</em> and the Blood Lords AP. We do, however,\
  \ have one significant downgrade to talk about. The gnome flickmace was a bit overpowered.\
  \ A one-handed reach weapon was stronger than we expected it to be, and it’s having\
  \ more of an outsized reputation than a single weapon should usually have in the\
  \ game. We’ve reduced its damage and added the sweep trait to bring it more in line\
  \ with other flails. Its new stat line is <b>Price</b> 3 gp; <b>Damage</b> 1d6 B;\
  \ <b>Bulk</b> 1; <b>Hands</b> 1; <b>Group</b> Flail; <b>Weapon Traits</b> Gnome,\
  \ reach, sweep.</p> \n      <p>We look forward to seeing what new characters you\
  \ make with these changes to the <em>Core Rulebook</em>! </p> \n      <p style=\"\
