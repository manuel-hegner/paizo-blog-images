  \ itemprop=\"description\">It's no secret that demons are pretty much my favorite\
  \ monsters in the game. When we were brainstorming ideas for regions to include\
  \ in Golarion, the concept of a realm where the demons had invaded and now ruled\
  \ was near the top of the list. In fact, we ended up with two regions where the\
  \ demons are in charge—the smaller of the two being Tanglebriar in southern Kyonin\
  \ (a region more or less transplanted directly from my homebrew world), and the\
  \ much larger Worldwound itself. Whereas Tanglebriar was basically the work of one\
  \ nascent demon lord, and as such was relatively limited in the scope of its area,\
  \ the Worldwound was the work of a full-on demon lord, Deskari, and the resulting\
  \ demon blight is correspondingly much more massive.</span></p> \n    <p>We've tinkered\
  \ here and there with the Worldwound over the past few years, but with the Wrath\
  \ of the Righteous Adventure Path, we're finally diving into the deep end of the\
  \ demon-haunted pool. Which means the time is finally write to head on into old\
  \ Sarkoris and explore it. Aptly titled <a href=\"/products/btpy8yvk\"><i>The Worldwound</i></a>,\
  \ this 64 page Campaign Setting book aims to do exactly that. Of course, it covers\
  \ the entire demonblighted region—even though Wrath of the Righteous remains pretty\
  \ tightly focused along the northeastern border, The Worldwound has a lot more secrets\
  \ to reveal.</p> \n    <p>There's plenty of new demons and monsters lurking in the\
  \ Worldwound, as well as in the pages of this book, as evidenced by the creepy monster\
  \ pictures that grace this post, but even the plants in this realm want to kill\
  \ you. Take, for example, the following excerpt from the book's chapter about Adventures\
  \ in the Worldwound:</p> \n    <p><b>Leechweed (CR 3 hazard)</b>: These plants cluster\
  \ thickly in the muddy marshes of the western Worldwound, typically growing in a\
  \ 5-foot-square patch. A single plant is slightly smaller than a human hand, and\
  \ consists of a mass of dark green leaves from which a single feeding stalk extends.\
  \ The tip of this stalk contains a small, lancet-like protrusion that can pierce\
  \ flesh with ease. Spotting a patch of leechweed before blundering into it requires\
  \ a DC 17 Knowledge (nature) or DC 22 Perception check. A living creature that comes\
  \ into contact with a patch of leechweed swiftly learns the source of the plant's\
  \ name, as dozens of feeding stalks suddenly stab and slash at any bits of exposed\
  \ flesh. As soon as a creature is in contact with leechweed, the plant attempts\
  \ an attack against it with a +9 bonus. The attacks continue at the end of each\
  \ of the creature's turns if it doesn't move away from the plant. On a hit, the\
  \ plant deals 1d4 points of damage and 1d6 points of bleed damage. Fire kills leechweed,\
  \ as does holy damage or any magical effect that specifically harms plants (such\
  \ as <i>blight</i>).</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/20130625Urannag.jpg\"\
