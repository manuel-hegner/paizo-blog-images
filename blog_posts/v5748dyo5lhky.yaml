  >Akina stood rooted, a peculiar chill dousing the embers in her gut. Could it be\
  \ possible? Could these creatures truly want to handle things in a civilized manner?\
  \ Ever since leaving for the war, she'd only ever encountered them on the battlefield,\
  \ knowing full well they sought her death as much as she theirs. What if Ondorum\
  \ was right? What if these hobgoblins hadn't participated in the fighting and were\
  \ just victims of circumstances? Could she damn them for the actions of others?</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The job would be done either way, so long as the hobgoblins left and\
  \ didn't bother anyone in the region again. Nothing compromised the mercenary band's\
  \ reputation, and Akina guessed Nigarl would let her take a few \"trophies\" as\
  \ proof to satisfy the locals.</p> \n     <p>She studied the desolate chapel as\
  \ all these doubts whirled through her. Then her gaze rested on Ondorum's guileless\
  \ expression and a cold flame kindled in her marrow.</p> \n     <p>\"Maybe.\" She\
  \ kept her voice as flat as possible. \"First, I got a question.\"</p> \n     <p>Nigarl\
  \ bowed her head. \"Ask.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Why didn't you tell Ondorum about the\
  \ barghest earlier?\"</p> \n     <p>The hobgoblin leader blinked. \"What?\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Ondorum looked at Akina askance. \"I don't understand.\"</p> \n    \
  \ <p>Akina watched the hobgoblin reactions carefully. \"Why leave him in the dark\
  \ about such a nasty critter if you knew it was lurking?\"</p> \n     <p>The monk\
  \ frowned. \"That would have been helpful, yes. We might've been more prepared.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"The beast came and went as it wished,\" Nigarl said. \"We had no\
  \ idea it'd be around or if it was off on its village hunts again.\"</p> \n    \
  \ <p>\"Hunts?\" Akina echoed. \"The reason Falcon's Hollow finally scrounged up\
  \ the funds to hire our band was because of the latest raid you all,\" she swept\
  \ her maulaxe at the warband, \"made against an outlying settlement. Half the place\
  \ burnt down, at least ten dead. Far more damage than a single barghest could make.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"There's plenty other than us attacking the countryside these days,\"\
  \ Nigarl said. \"No proof my band did anything.\"</p> \n     <p>\"No proof it wasn't\
  \ you,\" said Akina. </p> \n     <p>The hobgoblin leader snarled. \"This is pointless.\
  \ We're blamed for every mishap, and now we have an army of mercenaries set on us.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>Ondorum showed the warband leader an open palm. \"Not an army. Merely\
  \ a dozen or so.\" He looked to Akina. \"Unless you have reserves waiting at a distance?\"\
  \ </p> \n     <p>Akina stared back at him. \"Anyone ever mention that you talk too\
  \ much?\"</p> \n     <p>The monk grimaced. \"My old masters occasionally noted that\
  \ flaw in me, yes.\"</p> \n     <p>\"So they remain above while just the two of\
  \ you came to visit?\" Nigarl shifted her furred cloak, considering. \"How... civilized.\
  \ Will they send down a couple more if you don't return soon enough?\"</p> \n  \
  \   <p>Akina tightened her grip on the maulaxe. \"Why wouldn't we return? After\
  \ all, you did want to handle this all nice-like, hm?\"</p> \n     <p>Nigarl grinned\
  \ toothily while her warriors edged closer.</p> \n     <p>Ondorum glanced between\
  \ them. \"Is this the point where I admit their intentions may not have been entirely\
  \ peaceable?\" he asked Akina.</p> \n     <p>She nodded, keeping her eyes on Nigarl.\
  \ \"About time.\"</p> \n     <p>Nigarl snatched up her dagger and whip and jumped\
  \ back. \"Kill them.\"</p> \n     <p>Akina and Ondorum went back-to-back as the\
  \ hobgoblins attacked. Three charged Akina. She struck out, sending one reeling.\
  \ Another cut in with twin axes. She caught them across the maulaxe haft and struggled\
  \ to throw him back. He leaned all his weight in and roared in her face.</p> \n\
  \     <p>Akina bellowed back with all her might. The hobgoblin lurched as if she'd\
  \ struck him, and she used the slight opening to kick into the side of his knee.\
  \ The joint snapped and he staggered. A swipe of her axe-edge slashed his stomach\
  \ wide.</p> \n     <p>She jumped over the body and closed the gap between the third.\
  \ He wielded a broad blade and hacked at her wildly while she beat him back. Her\
  \ breaths came hot and fast, strength fueled by the furnace in her gut that baked\
  \ her from the inside out, blood and marrow bubbling.</p> \n     <p>Images blazed\
  \ through her mind. Ashen skulls. Leering goblins. Dead dwarves staring at a cloudy\
  \ sky. Settlements reduced to cinders. Each added fuel to the fury until she fought\
  \ within a storm of raging flame. </p> \n     <p>The hobgoblin came in with a desperate\
  \ two-handed strike. She bashed the sword aside and then whirled around to sweep\
  \ the axe-edge across, cleaving the creature's hands off at the wrists. The hobgoblin\
  \ stared at his bloody stumps until another blow sent his head rolling.</p> \n \
  \    <p>Fuming, she turned to find another victim to chop into kindling. Across\
  \ the chamber, Ondorum fended off four hobgoblins at once while Nigarl watched from\
  \ the side. </p> \n     <p>The monk shifted among them as he had with her, twisting\
  \ this way and that to let mortal blows bypass him. Then his feet rooted and he\
  \ took their blows with open palms and flicks of his elbows, absorbing and deflecting\
  \ even the most jarring hit. </p> \n     <p>One hobgoblin tried to stick him in\
  \ the side. As the blade slid past, Ondorum clamped onto the hobgoblin's wrist and\
  \ dragged him along. The warrior stumbled and ended up stabbing the fighter on the\
  \ opposite side. A club whistled at Ondorum's head, and the monk ducked, letting\
  \ the blow smash into the chest of another opponent.</p> \n     <p>Nigarl unspooled\
  \ her whip and lashed out. The thong coiled around Ondorum's waist. When she yanked,\
  \ barbs tore across his midsection and upset his balance. A hobgoblin cracked a\
  \ club across his side. Ondorum tried to right himself, but two warriors grabbed\
  \ his arms and clung tight. One bit into a bicep, while a third aimed a cleaver\
  \ at his skull.</p> \n     <p>Akina cleared the distance in a heartbeat, leading\
  \ the way with her helm. She took the hobgoblin in the side and his chest crumpled\
  \ beneath her assault. Heaving the dying creature aside, she spun and swept the\
  \ maulaxe hammer on the nearest hobgoblin's foot, shattering bone. </p> \n     <p>Ondorum's\
  \ fist connected with the back of the hobgoblin's head and the snap of her neck\
  \ resounded through the chamber. The other two turned to flee. Akina struck one\
  \ down with a backbreaking hammer blow. Ondorum's kick swept the legs out from under\
  \ the other, and a stomp crushed the creature's neck.</p> \n     <p>Shrieking curses,\
  \ Nigarl raced for the hall. Ondorum leaped into her path, ducked a swipe of her\
  \ dagger, and thrust a palm into her chest. The blow staggered her back halfway\
  \ across the chamber. As she shook off the daze, Ondorum stepped aside and bowed\
  \ to Akina, palms pressed together.</p> \n     <p>\"Yours.\"</p> \n     <p>Akina\
  \ grinned fiercely and lumbered toward the surviving hobgoblin. Nigarl snarled and\
  \ struck. The whip snapped around the maulaxe handle, but Akina let it be yanked\
  \ from her grip. Nigarl stumbled, not expecting her to relinquish the weapon so\
  \ easily. In that instant, Akina sprinted over and plowed into the hobgoblin leader.\
  \ Icy pain lanced through her shoulder as the dagger plunged in.</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ hobgoblin screamed as Akina bore her to the ground. Akina grabbed a fistful of\
  \ her snarled hair and wrenched. Nigarl's scalp tore loose and she thrashed, but\
  \ Akina planted a punch that bounced the hobgoblin's skull off the floor. </p> \n\
  \     <p>Then again. </p> \n     <div class=\"blurb360\">\n      <a href=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-PricePaid-Hobgoblin.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n      <br> <i>Never trust a hobgoblin who says she comes in peace.</i>\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>And again. </p> \n     <p>Fists blurred as she turned Nigarl's\
  \ face into an unrecognizable mash of bone and flesh. She didn't stop until a hand\
  \ settled on her shoulder. Still caught up in the frenzy, she turned and struckâ€”\
  but her fist impacted only Ondorum's palm, and the force behind the blow flowed\
  \ away.</p> \n     <p>Panting, Akina shook her head, trying to gather herself. Her\
  \ gauntlets dripped gore. Ondorum watched her, looking concerned. </p> \n     <p>She\
  \ rose, then reached back and yanked Nigarl's dagger out from her shoulder, ignoring\
  \ another wrench of pain. She flung the blade aside and forced herself to square\
  \ up with the monk.</p> \n     <p>\"I'm... you shouldn't have seen... I mean...\"\
  </p> \n     <p>She stumbled as the last fiery wisp of strength burned out, leaving\
  \ her with bones made of lead and muscles that couldn't have squashed a fly. Ondorum\
  \ caught her arm and helped her remain standing. </p> \n     <p>After retrieving\
  \ her weapon, it took them several hours to find a way back to the surface, doubling-back\
  \ from dead-end passages and collapsed chambers. When they emerged into the fading\
  \ sunlight, the ruins appeared empty at first. Then someone shouted, \"They're back!\"\
  \ and mercenaries emerged from around the courtyard. </p> \n     <p>Durgan and the\
  \ gang gathered around them, clamoring for answers. Akina sat on a stone and let\
  \ them bandage her shoulder as she spun out the main thread of events. Ondorum accepted\
  \ a salve for his wounded arm and waist, but deferred further aid, insisting he'd\
  \ heal soon enough. </p> \n     <p>Once she caught everyone up, Akina studied the\
  \ clearing. \"Figure we can camp here and head back tomorrow to collect my pay.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"Your pay?\" Durgan echoed.</p> \n     <p>\"I did most of the work,\
  \ after all.\" She nodded at the monk. \"Some goes to him, though.\"</p> \n    \
  \ <p>Ondorum shook his head. \"I leave any share to your companions.\"</p> \n  \
  \   <p>She grinned. \"Oh, take a little credit, won't you?\"</p> \n     <p>His shoulders\
  \ drooped and he smiled sadly before bowing and wandering over to a corner of the\
  \ ruined courtyard. Akina exchanged looks with the band.</p> \n     <p>\"Give us\
  \ a few minutes, hm?\"</p> \n     <p>She joined Ondorum where he'd taken up a meditative\
  \ pose along one wall. Laying her maulaxe down, she tried to imitate the posture\
  \ but couldn't get her stubbier legs to cooperate. Finally she grunted and just\
  \ sat back against the wall.</p> \n     <p>\"What's gnawing your gristle? We got\
  \ out alive, didn't we?\"</p> \n     <p>He spoke without opening his eyes. \"I'd\
  \ hoped to resolve the situation more amicably.\"</p> \n     <p>She chuckled. \"\
  Funny thing. So did I.\"</p> \n     <p>He peeked at her sidelong. \"You wanted to\
  \ spare them?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Hell no. Glad to see them gone and glad we were\
  \ the ones who ended them. But you were so committed. I felt bad seeing all that\
  \ effort defending them go to waste.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Nothing is ever wasted,\"\
  \ he said. \"There's always a lesson to be learned.\"</p> \n     <p>\"That so? What\
  \ do you figure's the lesson here?\"</p> \n     <p>\"That I have much more to learn\
  \ about the world and the nature of its people than I'd imagined.\" He sighed. \"\
  It is... disheartening at times to think how far I have yet to go.\"</p> \n    \
  \ <p>They fell silent for a while, watching the band prep a rough campsite and gather\
  \ firewood. Before weariness could sink too deep into her bones, Akina roused herself.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>\"Fairingot.\"</p> \n     <p>Ondorum's crystalline eyebrows rose.\
  \ \"Pardon?\"</p> \n     <p>She tugged her helm off, letting her coil of braided\
  \ hair fall loose, her trademark platinum streak shooting through the otherwise\
  \ dusky blonde strands. </p> \n     <p>\"My family name,\" she said. \"It's Fairingot.\
  \ We hail from Taggoret.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Fairingot.\" He tugged at his chin as\
  \ he eyed her. A smile teased his lips. \"Fitting.\"</p> \n     <p>She scoffed and\
  \ waved him off. </p> \n     <p>\"Isn't Taggoret a bit north of here?\" he asked.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Sure. But we're heading south once we collect our bounty.\"</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"You're not returning home, then.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Not until I'm good\
  \ and ready to.\"</p> \n     <p>\"When will that be?\"</p> \n     <p>Akina studied\
  \ the head of her maulaxe, thumbing a nonexistent blemish. \"When people stop paying\
  \ us for what we're good at. Rumor says there's plenty of work down near Almas.\"\
  \ She glanced over. \"Figure you could come with us.\"</p> \n     <p>Ondorum crossed\
  \ his arms. His sleeves tugged back, revealing ridges of purple crystals along his\
  \ forearms. </p> \n     <p>\"Why would you want a fool of a monk as a companion?\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"I don't think you're fool.\" She shrugged at his dubious look.\
  \ \"Not a total one, at least. But you've got some fine skill. I don't admit to\
  \ being impressed too often but... I'm impressed. Besides, our band could use someone\
  \ who doesn't just jump into every mess without considering other ways to clean\
  \ it up first.\" She studied him from the corner of her eye, trying to gauge his\
  \ reaction. \"And you could use us in return.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Use you? How?\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"How long you been traveling alone?\"</p> \n     <p>He clasped hands,\
  \ considering. \"A long while.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Think that's a good thing, being\
  \ all by yourself? You may have a ways to go, but you don't have to go it alone.\
  \ You said it yourself earlier. You're looking to learn from new experiences. Get\
  \ some new perspectives.\"</p> \n     <p>\"You're offering yours?\"</p> \n     <p>She\
  \ waved at the others. \"Ours. We're not a bad lot. A little scruffy, sure, but\
  \ earnest. And if you've got something against coin, I'll just hold your share until\
  \ you figure out what you want to do with it.\"</p> \n     <p>He flexed his jaw\
  \ as if chewing on the idea.</p> \n     <p>\"Tell you what,\" she said. \"I'll throw\
  \ in a few tales of my home to sweeten the deal.\"</p> \n     <p>\"True tales?\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"That'd be for you to figure out.\"</p> \n     <p>He grinned, an\
  \ expression Akina realized she quite liked on his stony face. \"Will you teach\
  \ me any dwarven jokes?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Most jokes I know aren't fit for proper\
  \ companyâ€”especially for anyone trying to be all polished and perfect.\"</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"If my sense of humor is lacking, perhaps I can fix its faults by rounding\
  \ it out.\"</p> \n     <p>She clapped him on the arm. \"Might be hope for you yet.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"There's always hope.\" He lifted his chin, voice firming. \"No\
  \ matter how far one wanders, you can find your way again. You just have to follow\
  \ the right path.\"</p> \n     <p>\"If it's a simple matter of paths...\" She pushed\
  \ up to her feet and offered a hand. \"How about we see where this one leads, hm?\"\
  </p> \n     <p>After the briefest consideration, he clasped her hand in his. \"\
  I've a feeling it will take us many interesting places.\" </p>\n     <p><b>Coming\
