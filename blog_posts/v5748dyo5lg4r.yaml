  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">The Gauntlet\
  \ was awarded on Sunday, and with your help, Paizo brought home this mighty trophy!\
  \ Sponsored by Card Kingdom, the Gauntlet tournament featured competitors from a\
  \ wide array of local game companies and groups. Funds raised by all of the teams\
  \ went to support Child's Play, a charity that donates games and toys to sick kids\
  \ in hospitals around the world. On top of furthering such a great cause, donations\
  \ also earned each team a number of \"Power Ups\" to use during the event, granting\
  \ an edge against the opposition.</span></p> \n    <p>And let me tell you: the competition\
  \ was fierce! Before the tournament even started, the team from the Removed From\
  \ Play podcast surged into the lead, raffling off an amazing Warmachine army. We\
  \ fought back, but in the end, neither of our teams were prepared for Bungie's fundraising\
  \ juggernaut. Raising over $6,000 in just the last few days before the competition,\
  \ they earned the top spot, which came with 5 bonus points and a mountain of power\
  \ ups to use during the event.</p> \n    <p>Fundraising alone, however, would not\
  \ win you The Gauntlet.</p> \n    <p>As the clock struck 3pm, the battle was joined.\
  \ I sat down to play Magic against one member of each other team, while Stephen\
  \ played Ticket to Ride and Erik and Jessica proved their superiority in geek trivia.\
  \ Both Stephen and I did well, earning a total of 13 points for our team, but Erik\
  \ and Jessica dominated at trivia, earning 20 points! Stephen then joined Erik and\
  \ Jessica to play Ugg-tect, a game in which the players take on the role of caveman\
  \ architects trying to construct monuments using only grunts and body language.\
  \ They built well, but in the end, we earned only 8 points from the game.</p> \n\
  \    <p>We had a total of 41 points, but that was only enough for 2nd place. The\
  \ Removed From Play team was hot on our heels with 40, while Bungie held the lead\
  \ with 42. Before the final game, the winners of the best costume were announced\
  \ and Bungie pulled even further ahead (to 47) with their excellent Doctor Horrible\
  \ ensemble. The final game was Suspend, a game in which you must balance wire playing-pieces\
  \ on a precarious pole. The first team to hang all of their pieces would earn 20\
  \ points, but the other teams would earn points too, depending on how fast they\
  \ could finish their game. We were in trouble. We not only needed to win the final\
  \ game, but we needed to win by a wide margin to overcome the 6-point lead Bungie\
  \ had built.</p> \n    <p>As the countdown reached zero, each team went into a flurry\
  \ of building. If a piece fell, you lost a team member, meaning that you had to\
  \ be fast, but steady. As Erik, Jessica, Stephen, and I began to rapidly put together\
  \ our sculpture, we could not help but keep an eye on Bungie, who were just next\
  \ to us on the same table. Our practice paid off. We had played Suspend for a few\
  \ hours earlier that week, becoming skilled at building rapidly, but also figuring\
  \ out the best way to make the structure stable. As a team, we shouted \"JUDGE\"\
  \ as our last piece came to rest. We were first, but it was not over yet. If Bungie\
  \ came in second, they would earn enough points to claim The Gauntlet. We waited,\
  \ watching the other teams intently. Then Removed From Play finished their game.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>We had done it. The Gauntlet was ours!</p> \n    <p>We had a great time\
  \ participating in The Gauntlet. It was a hard-fought battle, but everyone was very\
  \ friendly and good-natured. After all, the real winner this day was the children.\
  \ The Paizo team would like to thank all of the other teams for a truly awesome\
  \ time and a great competition: Bungie, Caf√© Mox Regulars, Card Kingdom, GeekGirlCon,\
  \ Lady Planeswalkers, Penny Arcade, Removed From Play, Sucker Punch, and Wizards\
  \ of the Coast. Special thanks go out to everyone at Card Kingdom who spent countless\
  \ hours setting up this fantastic event. We look forward to defending our title\
  \ (and The Gauntlet itself) next year!</p> \n    <p>You can watch a video of the\
  \ entire event <a href=\"http://www.thegauntlet.me\">at this link</a> over on The\
  \ Gauntlet page. The final event starts at around 3:17:30 and you can hear the Paizo\
  \ team call for a judge at around 3:20:00. You can also catch The Gauntlet being\
  \ presented at around 3:40:00.</p> \n    <p>Of course, now that we have The Gauntlet,\
  \ we thought it only appropriate to show you how it has made life better for us\
  \ around the Paizo offices (and beyond!).</p> \n    <center> \n     <table> \n \

  \ we had a wide variety of awards to give you, the fans, for helping us reach certain\
  \ funding goals during the event. On Friday, we posted a <a href=\"/download/pathfinder/20140516-PrimativeHuman.zip\"\
  ><b>Primitive Human Race</b></a> for use in your Pathfinder games. We also promised\
  \ a number of spoilers from the upcoming <a href=\"/products/btpy95d1\">Advanced\
  \ Class Guide</a>. You can find some of the spoilers in <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lg41\"\
  >this thread</a>, but the rest are posted below.</p> \n    <ul> \n     <li>In the\
  \ playtest for the Advanced Class Guide, the new classes were called hybrid classes,\
  \ since each is a mix of two parent classes. In the playtest, you could not take\
  \ levels in either of the parent classes if you had levels in the hybrid class.\
  \ In the final version, we removed this restriction.</li> \n     <li>The Shaman's\
  \ spell list changed several times during the playtest. In the final version, we\
  \ gave the class its own unique spell list to better suit its theme. This includes\
  \ a number of spells drawn from the cleric list, the druid list, and the witch list,\
  \ but it also includes a number of brand new spells found in the book.</li> \n \
  \    <li>The Skald got access to a few more powers from its parent classes, including\
  \ versatile performance and uncanny dodge. It also got a few new songs that it can\
  \ use in place of its raging song, such as the song of the fallen. Check it out!<br>\
  \ \n      <blockquote>\n       <i>Song of the Fallen (Su)</i>: At 14th level, a\
  \ skald can temporarily revive dead allies to continue fighting, with the same limitations\
  \ as raise dead. The skald selects a dead ally within 60 feet and expends 1 round\
  \ of raging song to bring that ally back to life. The revived ally is alive but\
  \ staggered. Each round, the skald may expend another 1 round of raging song to\
  \ keep that ally alive for another round. The ally automatically dies if the skald\
  \ ends this performance or is interrupted. The skald may revive multiple allies\
  \ with this ability (either at the same time or over successive rounds) but must\
  \ expend 1 round of raging song per revived ally per round to maintain the effect.\n\
  \      </blockquote></li> \n     <li>There are a wide variety of great options for\
  \ every character in this book, from archetypes to feats, spells, and magic items.\
  \ Just to give you a taste, here is one of the more interesting spells in the book.<p></p>\
  \ \n      <blockquote> \n       <p class=\"stat-block-title\">Path of Glory</p>\
  \ \n       <blockquote>\n        <p><b>School</b> conjuration (healing); <b>Level</b>\
  \ bard 2, cleric 2<br> <b>Casting Time</b> 1 standard action<br> <b>Components</b>\
  \ V, S<br> <b>Range</b> touch (see text)<br> <b>Area</b> four 5-ft. squares/level\
  \ (see text)<br> <b>Duration</b> 1 round/level<br> <b>Saving Throw</b> none; <b>Spell\
  \ Resistance</b> no</p>\n        <p> </p>\n        <p>You cause four 5-foot squares\
  \ (one of which must be your space) to glow with dim illumination. Starting on your\
  \ next turn, as a swift action you can extend the glowing area by an additional\
  \ four 5-foot squares; each new square must be adjacent to a square that was previously\
  \ glowing. Allies that end their turns on a glowing square (including one who falls\
  \ unconscious in the square) are healed of 1 point of damage.</p> \n       </blockquote>\n\
  \      </blockquote></li> \n    </ul> \n    <p>Well, that about wraps up our coverage\
  \ of The Gauntlet.</p> \n    <p>Wait... what's that?</p> \n    <p>Stephen wants\
  \ to say something about me needing to get punched with the Gauntlet. That sounds\
  \ like a nasty rumor. I am sure nothing like that would happen within the next few\
  \ weeks for all of you to watch. I am sure of it. Anyway, I want to thank all of\
  \ you who helped make this victory possible. Look for The Gauntlet to make a number\
  \ of appearances in this blog over the coming year. We are looking forward to defending\
  \ our title next year, hopefully allowing us to keep this mighty trophy. We know\
  \ that you will be here to support us!</p> \n    <p>Jason Bulmahn<br> <i>Lead Designer</i></p>\
