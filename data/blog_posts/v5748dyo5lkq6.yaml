  \ \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Historically, alchemy was a protoscience with\
  \ diverse traditions seen throughout the world. Its chemical discoveries were often\
  \ explained and expanded upon using the metaphysical traditions of the practitioner's\
  \ native culture. These alchemical experiments and observations were later refined\
  \ by experimentation and rigor to become the modern science of chemistry.</p> \n\
  \     <p>In Pathfinder First Edition, alchemy was the domain of lower-level pseudo-magical\
  \ treasures, at least until the alchemist made his debut in the <em>Pathfinder RPG\
  \ Advanced Player's Guide</em>. This class forged the way for creating higher-level\
  \ alchemical items and effects, though it often leaned on arcane magic to get the\
  \ job done.</p> \n     <p>When we tapped the alchemist for inclusion in the Pathfinder\
  \ Playtest, it gave us the chance to rethink the essentials of alchemy and create\
  \ a broad tradition that reflected its historical inspiration. For the upcoming\
  \ version of the game, we've pulled magic and alchemy apart. Alchemy might feature\
  \ dramatic effects, but these are powered by the reactions of powerful chemicals—\
  and sometimes catalyzed by resonance—creating a type of fantastic mad science. Where\
  \ magical power comes from the energies of a spellcasting tradition, alchemical\
  \ power comes from the fusion of latent potential trapped within matter, released\
  \ as energy through a reaction with a different potent material. Strike a sunrod\
  \ on a hard surface and its alchemical reagents combine to create light. A creature's\
  \ internal chemistry interacts with an elixir of life to heal wounds or brace the\
  \ body against toxins. Bombs let off explosive energy when their flask shatters\
  \ against a creature, exposing the contents to the air.</p> \n     <p>While magic\
  \ involves pulling energy out of thin air by way of spells, rituals, or magically\
  \ empowered items, basic alchemy is a specialty of the Crafting skill. Any character\
  \ with the Alchemical Crafting skill feat can create alchemical items as long as\
  \ they have the proper formula, along with enough time and reagents. Alchemists\
  \ know (or hazard) shortcuts to the process and can create unstable alchemical items\
  \ by using an alchemist kit and paying a resonance cost.</p> \n     <p>So, what\
  \ kind of items can they make in the Pathfinder Playtest? Alchemical items come\
  \ in four general categories: here's what you can expect from each.</p> \n     <h2>Bombs</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>This category will be familiar territory for those of you currently\
  \ playing Pathfinder. Alchemist's fire, liquid ice, and bottled lightning have been\
  \ a mainstay for low-level alchemists and other characters over the years. In the\
  \ Pathfinder Playtest, these items are the baselines for alchemical bombs. While\
  \ the base bombs deal a relatively low amount of damage, the advanced alchemy class\
  \ feature allows the alchemist to infuse them with extra power according to the\
  \ alchemist's level. While these powerful bombs are unstable (losing potency in\
  \ either 24 hours or after a round, depending on how the alchemist crafted them),\
  \ during that limited time they can pack a punch. For instance, here's bottled lightning.</p>\
  \ \n     <blockquote> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-title\">Bottled Lightning <span\
  \ class=\"stat-block-cr\">Item 1</span></p> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Alchemical,\
  \ Bomb, Consumable, Electricity</b><br> <b>Price</b> 3 gp<br> <b>Method of Use</b>\
  \ held, 2 hands; <b>Bulk</b> L</p> \n      <p class=\"stat-block\">Bottled lightning\
  \ is packed with reagents that create an electric blast when exposed to air. Bottled\
  \ lightning deals 1d6 electricity damage and 1 electricity splash damage and causes\
  \ the target to be flat-footed to all creatures until the start of your next turn.</p>\
  \ \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>If an 11th-level alchemist makes one of these bombs\
  \ using his advanced alchemy, the electricity damage increases to 4d6 damage, though\
  \ the splash stays at 1 (unless said alchemist takes the Calculated Bomber feat,\
  \ which would increase that splash damage to his Intelligence modifier). The flat-footed\
  \ effect also stacks with anything extra the alchemist might add to the bomb from\
  \ his class feats, making bottled lightning a great choice when going up against\
  \ bosses or high-AC foes.</p> \n     <p>Of course, there are some surprises among\
  \ the alchemical bombs. Thunderstones, which deal greater sonic damage in the hands\
  \ of a higher-level alchemist, and tanglefoot bags are also on the bomb list.</p>\
  \ \n     <h2>Elixirs</h2> \n     <p>In Pathfinder First Edition, we have potions,\
  \ elixir, and extracts, all taking up much of the same mechanical design space.\
  \ In the playtest, these divisions are less ambiguous. Potions are potent liquids\
  \ made by way of magical crafting and have magical, often arcane, effects. Elixirs,\
  \ on the other hand, are alchemical concoctions producing effects that are often\
  \ very dramatic, but are non-magical. Potions are often quicker to use and usually\
  \ pack some extra oomph, but elixirs work even in places where magic is dulled or\
  \ suppressed, and an alchemist can craft them in a hurry. Though both potions and\
  \ elixirs are used by consuming them, and often require a bit of resonance to kick\
  \ them into gear, elixirs' spectrum of effects tend to deal with changing the body\
  \ or state of mind. An example of this second sort of elixir is the liquid courage\
  \ found in bravo's brew.</p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-title\"\
  >Bravo's Brew <span class=\"stat-block-cr\">Item 3</span></p> \n      <p class=\"\
  stat-block-1\"><b>Alchemical, Consumable, Elixir, Mental</b><br> <b>Price</b> 7\
  \ gp<br> <b>Method of Use</b> held, 1 hand; <b>Bulk</b> L<br> <b>Activation</b>\
  \ Operate Activation</p> \n      <p>This flask of foaming beer grants courage. For\
  \ the next hour after drinking this elixir, you gain a +1 item bonus to Will saves,\
  \ and a +3 item bonus to Will saves against fear.</p> \n     </blockquote> \n  \
  \   <p>Some of the most potent elixirs are mutagens. These elixirs transform the\
  \ mind and the body in dramatic ways, granting sizeable item bonuses to a number\
  \ of related skill checks and attributes. However, this comes with a drawback: penalties\
  \ to some other group of relevant skills and attributes. Mutagens also tend to morph\
  \ the user's physical features in some way. For instance, a lesser bestial mutagen\
  \ gives you a more savage aspect with greater muscle mass, granting you a +2 item\
  \ bonus to Athletics checks and unarmed attack rolls and increasing the amount of\
  \ damage die you roll for such attacks, but this new form is clumsy and lumbering,\
  \ imparting a -1 penalty to Acrobatics, Stealth, and Thievery checks, as well as\
  \ to AC and Reflex saves.</p> \n     <p>Mutagens have some limitations. They must\
  \ be attuned to a specific creature; this typically involves including some bit\
  \ of the attuned creature's body (such as hair, nail trimmings, saliva, or the like)\
  \ as a reagent during the crafting process. Moreover, you can only have one mutagen\
  \ benefit active at a time, though you can suffer from any number of mutagen drawbacks\
  \ simultaneously.</p> \n     <p>What about extracts? Well, in this scheme, they're\
  \ just not necessary anymore. But, I wouldn't be surprised if we do something else\
  \ with extracts sometime in the future, reviving that game term to make something\
  \ particularly dynamic and fun.</p> \n     <h2>Poisons</h2> \n     <p>Alchemists\
  \ usually deal with elixirs that bolster the body and the mind, but they can also\
  \ dabble in alchemical poisons that do just the opposite. While there are many poisons\
  \ in nature, alchemical poisons tend to be more refined versions of those natural\
  \ poisons, often distilled or concentrated, created for both potency and ease of\
  \ use.</p> \n     <p>For example, here's the sleep poison favored by drow.</p> \n\
  \     <blockquote> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-title\">Sleep Poison <span class=\"\
  stat-block-cr\">Item 2</span></p> \n      <p><b>Alchemical, Consumable, Injury,\
  \ Poison</b><br> <b>Price</b> 5 gp<br> <b>Method of Use</b> held, 2 hands; <b>Bulk</b>\
  \ L<br> <b>Activation</b> 3 Operate Activations, no Resonance Point cost<br> <b>Saving\
  \ Throw</b> Fortitude DC 13; <b>Maximum Duration</b> 4 hours; <b>Stage 1</b> slowed\
  \ 1 (1 round); <b>Stage 2</b> asleep with no Perception check to wake up (1 round);\
  \ <b>Stage 3</b> asleep with no Perception check to wake up (1d4 hours)</p> \n \
  \    </blockquote> \n     <p>Let's say you found or made a vial of sleep poison.\
  \ It takes three Operate Activation actions to apply it to a weapon (which must\
  \ be one that deals either piercing or slashing damage). If the next attack made\
  \ by the weapon is a hit or critical hit, the target must attempt a save against\
  \ the poison, gaining the effects of Stage 1 on a failure (or Stage 2 on a critical\
  \ failure), with later saves determining how the poison either intensifies or is\
  \ shaken off. Since the maximum duration of the poison is 4 hours, no matter what\
  \ happens, the poison will be completely gone from the target's system 4 hours later.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Like all alchemical items, an alchemist can create a less stable version\
  \ of a poison using his advanced alchemy, as long as he possesses the formula for\
  \ that poison and has the resonance to spare. Here's the bad news. Sleep poison\
  \ is a closely guarded secret of the drow, so good luck getting the formula.</p>\
  \ \n     <h2>Tools</h2> \n     <p>The last category of alchemical items is tools.\
  \ Tools are the items that don't fit in other categories. They typically affect\
  \ the terrain, vision, or other aspects of the environment, instead of affecting\
  \ a creature directly. The sunrod is one example of an alchemical tool. The smokestick\
  \ is another.</p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-title\">Smokestick\
  \ <span class=\"stat-block-cr\">Item 1</span></p> \n      <p class=\"stat-block\"\
  ><b>Alchemical, Consumable</b><br> <b>Price</b> 2 gp<br> <b>Method of Use</b> held,\
  \ 2 hands; <b>Bulk</b> L<br> <b>Activation</b> Operate Activation, no Resonance\
  \ Point cost</p> \n      <p>With a sharp twist of this item, you instantly create\
  \ a screen of thick, opaque smoke in a 5-foot-radius burst centered on one corner\
  \ of your space. All creatures within that area are concealed. The smoke lasts for\
  \ 1 minute or until dispersed by a strong wind.</p> \n     </blockquote> \n    \
  \ <p>As you can see alchemy has become a discipline in its own right, with many\
  \ tools to aid adventurers in general and the alchemist in particular.</p> \n  \
