  \ Strategy #11—Building a Party</h1> \n    <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"> \n   \
  \  <p class=\"date\">Thursday, July 13, 2017</p> \n     <p><i>This is the eleventh\
  \ installment of our strategy blog written by game historian <a href=\"http://erzo.org/shannon/index.phtml\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Shannon Appelcline</a>. You can read all the installments <a\
  \ href=\"/paizo/blog/tags/adventureCardGameStrategy\">here</a>.</i></p> \n     <p\
  \ itemprop=\"description\">To date, these strategy articles have concentrated on\
  \ the gameplay of Pathfinder Adventure Card Game scenarios. However, the metagame\
  \ of PACG is quite important too—and it's much of what makes the game unique. That\
  \ metagame begins with the construction of a party, which depends on understanding\
  \ the types of characters you're using.</p>\n     <p> </p>\n     <h2>Warriors are\
  \ the most important characters</h2> \n     <p>The two main goals in most scenarios\
  \ are to defeat henchmen so that you can close locations and to defeat villains\
  \ so that you can win the game. This means that warriors are the most important\
  \ type of character in the game. However, don't take this to mean just weapon users;\
  \ warriors include any character who can generate high results on combat checks.\
  \ Amiri is a warrior, obviously, but so is Ezren, since he can reliably draw spells\
  \ and use them to generate high combat values.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ></a> \n      <p>Wars not make one great. <i>Warriors</i> make one great.</p> \n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>Whatever their precise class, you should have lots of warriors.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><i>Corollary #1: Be very careful of characters with weak skill/card\
  \ combos.</i> If a character doesn't have either the Ranged or Melee skill, he's\
  \ more likely to end up in a bad situation, rolling small, unmodified dice in combat.\
  \ But you need to be especially careful if these characters also have few weapons\
  \ or few combat spells. Lini may be the weakest warrior in Rise of the Runelords\
  \ because she has no Ranged skill, no Melee skill, starts out rolling a d4 in combat,\
  \ has to pay a card to get that to a reasonable number, has no weapons, and will\
  \ likely use some of her spell slots for healing or support.</p> \n     <p><i>Corollary\
  \ #2: Be somewhat careful of characters with low fighting stats.</i> It may be less\
  \ obvious that you should be wary of characters who have a low die associated with\
  \ their Ranged or Melee skill. Kyra from Rise of the Runelords is the prime example\
  \ here, since she uses a lowly d6 for her Melee skill. This is fine for fighting\
  \ most low-level monsters, but it's awful when you're fighting powerful monsters,\
  \ henchmen, or villains, because in those situations you often want to lay down\
  \ the blessings… and they'll be worth just 1d6 each!</p> \n     <p><i>Corollary\
  \ #3: Be aware of your weak warriors.</i> Just because warriors are important doesn't\
  \ mean you should ignore characters who are weak at fighting, because everyone has\
  \ their own advantages: Kyra is crucial for healing and Lini is perhaps the best\
  \ character in the game because she's strong at <i>everything</i> other than combat\
  \ if she has an animal present. The trick is to know who your strong warriors are\
  \ and who your weak warriors are, and use them appropriately. Send the strong warriors\
  \ after villains and monster-heavy locations and send the weak warriors after boon-filled\
  \ locations and use them to temporarily close locations while the villain is being\
  \ fought.</p> \n     <h2>Healers are the second most important characters</h2> \n\
  \     <p>Because cards are a limited resource in PACG, a party without a healer\
  \ is at a grave disadvantage. Characters will usually only be able to use their\
  \ cards once, and every one that slips out of a deck due to play or to damage puts\
  \ that character one inevitable step closer to both death and loss. One healer in\
  \ a party is practically required, so healers are the second most important character\
  \ type in PACG.</p> \n     <p>Healers typically include any character with the Divine\
  \ skill and spell card slots (and, obviously, some healing spells in those slots).\
  \ A few characters like Kyra and Seelah can heal without specific spells, but spells\
  \ are generally better, so those powers should be considered backups.</p> \n   \
  \  <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-KyraFront.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-KyraFront_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a> <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6001-SeelahFront.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6001-SeelahFront_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n      <p>To err is human; to heal, Divine.</p> \n     </div> \n     <p>If\
  \ you have no healers, then you're likely to spend a lot of your time and effort\
  \ figuring out how to overcome that deficiency, perhaps with one-use healing spells\
  \ for Merisiel, perhaps with healing objects and healing allies. You'll be able\
  \ to make a go of it, but it'll hurt your efficiency.</p> \n     <p><i>Corollary\
  \ #1: It's good to have a backup healer.</i> One healer is good, but having at least\
  \ one and a half is better. It might be another major healer or it might be someone\
  \ like Lem (or even an advanced Merisiel) who can mix a Cure spell into his deck.\
  \ The object is to have healing available if your main healer is tied down, if her\
  \ deck is clogged, or even if she's not available for a play session. But don't\
  \ go overboard: healing is vitally important, but you'll pay for it with lost efficiency\
  \ in other areas (like fighting!), so only include the healers you need, which is\
  \ probably somewhere between one and two.</p> \n     <p><i>Corollary #2: Make sure\
  \ your main healer can recycle cards.</i> You should make sure that your main healer\
  \ has some way to get expended healing back into her deck. For example, Kyra and\
  \ Seelah can both do so with their special healing abilities, while Lem can exchange\
  \ other spells for his healing if it ends up in his discard pile. Another easy method\
  \ to keep a healer cycling is to make sure she has at least two healing spells:\
  \ if she fails to recharge the first, she can heal herself with the second.</p>\
  \ \n     <h2>Disablers are the third most important characters</h2> \n     <p>Banes\
  \ fall into two categories: monsters and barriers. Thanks to your focus on warriors,\
  \ you've already taken care of the monsters, but you still need to worry about barriers.\
  \ If you continually fail to defeat them, they can dramatically slow down your gameplay.\
  \ If they get stuck on top of a location deck, they can prevent exploration. And\
  \ if they do lots of damage, they can even kill your characters.</p> \n     <p>They're\
  \ a lot more varied than monsters, so how do you defeat them? Make sure that your\
  \ party has at least some disabler support with a character strong in Dexterity\
  \ (possibly with the Acrobatics or Disable skills) and/or Wisdom (possibly with\
  \ the Perception skill).</p> \n     <p>Merisiel is usually an optimal character\
  \ to fill the disabler niche. In Rise of the Runelords, she has all three skills,\
  \ with Acrobatics and Disable at d12+2. Rise of the Runelords Sajan is almost as\
  \ good, with Acrobatics at d10+2 and Wisdom at d8. In Skull &amp; Shackles, Damiel\
  \ and Jirelle are good choices; in Wrath of the Righteous, Arueshalae and Ekkie\
  \ are strong at Dexterity but weak at Wisdom. Mummy's Mask offers quite a few possibilities,\
  \ of which Damiel and Mavaro are the most well-rounded.</p> \n     <p><i>Corollary\
  \ #1: Be aware of your deficiency.</i> Since they're your third priority, disablers\
  \ are the character type that you're most likely to neglect in your PACG party.\
  \ If so, be aware of this deficiency. Save the barrier-heavy locations for last,\
  \ or be sure you have extra blessings when you visit them. Alternatively, build\
  \ your decks and take feats to help you better deal with barriers: Masterwork Tools\
  \ can be a pretty good solution until late in an adventure path.</p> \n     <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-MerisielFront.jpg\"\

  ></a> \n      <p>Sometimes you need skills, and sometimes you need cards. And sometimes\
  \ you need both.</p> \n     </div> \n     <p><i>Corollary #2: Be aware of your adventure.</i>\
  \ Also be aware that there's quite a bit of variability for barriers between the\
  \ different adventure paths. Rise of the Runelords has the most traditional traps.\
  \ Skull &amp; Shackles has quite a few Task barriers that require a wider variety\
  \ of skills. Wrath of the Righteous has a lot of Temptations that can (perhaps)\
  \ be easily overcome without skill rolls.</p> \n     <p>Of course, knowing the types\
  \ of characters to include in your group is just the first step; there's a lot more\
  \ to building a good party, as will be discussed in the next two articles.</p> \n\
