  \   </div> \n   <h1>Pathfinder Battles Preview: Big Bads (Vol. 1)</h1> \n   <p class=\"\
  date\">Friday, April 27, 2012</p> \n   <p>I'm pleased to report that all but one\
  \ of the miniatures in the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/riseOfTheRunelords\"\
  >Rise of the Runelords</a> set have been approved (we're still tinkering with a\
  \ final paint scheme on that last one to get it right), and we stand on the precipice\
  \ of an important deadline. WizKids is about to order all of the paint for this\
  \ set, so that the production run can begin in earnest. That means Rise of the Runelords\
  \ miniatures will soon be spooling their way down the factory line, which means\
  \ the set's August release is now visible on the horizon.</p> \n   <p>Last week,\
  \ we posted <a href=\"/products/btpy8rqs\">images of the set's packaging to paizo.com</a>,\
  \ and it took an astute reader all of 11 minutes to realize that the packaging constituted\
  \ a stealth preview of a previously unseen miniature, and revealed one of the big\
  \ secrets of the Rise of the Runelords set.</p> \n   <p>As many of you know, we\
  \ had to remove three Huge miniatures from the original set mix in order to keep\
  \ production costs under control. Since I'd revealed the set included a Huge White\
  \ Dragon in the very first raft of spoilers I leaked about the set here in this\
  \ blog, and since we'd already revealed three Huge miniatures (the <a href=\"/paizo/blog/2012/january/v5748dyo5ld20\"\
  >Treachery Demon</a>, <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ldaz\">Lamia Harridan</a>,\
  \ and <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ldbq\">Storm Giant</a>), many folks reasonably\
  \ concluded that the fourth unrevealed Huge must be the aforementioned White Dragon.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Alas, as the packaging preview revealed, the Huge White Dragon will NOT\
  \ be in the Rise of the Runelords set after all, as it was one of the three Huge\
  \ miniatures we had to cut for cost reasons. The decision had nothing to do with\
  \ the quality of the sculpt (which is EXCELLENT), but more to do with its versatility\
  \ outside the Rise of the Runelords set. For we have every intention of releasing\
  \ the White Dragon in an upcoming release, possibly sooner rather than later. </p>\
  \ \n   <p>Yes, there is an important White Dragon encounter in the <a href=\"/products/btpy8mqq\"\
  >Rise of the Runelords Adventure Path Anniversary Edition</a>, but the monster is\
  \ ubiquitous enough that it'll fit in just about anywhere. </p> \n   <p>But some\
  \ minis in this set are designed specifically for use with the Rise of the Runelords\
  \ Adventure Path to the degree that moving them to another set simply isn't an option.\
  \ The actual fourth Huge figure in the set is one such miniature. I give you, the\
  \ Karzoug Statue:</p> \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/20120427-Karzoug.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/20120427-Karzoug_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\
  \   </div> \n   <p>Here we have the treacherous Karzoug, Runelord of Greed, the\
  \ biggest of the big bads of the Rise of the Runelords campaign, come to life as\
  \ a giant animated statue. When I say “giant,” I'm not kidding. The Karzoug Statue\
  \ is the tallest and largest of the four Huge miniatures in the set, cutting an\
  \ imposing figure appropriate for its role in one of the key climactic encounters\
  \ of the entire Adventure Path. He's so big we actually had to change the Huge Booster\
  \ packaging after we'd finished it just so he could actually fit in the box.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>WizKids's sculptors and painters have done a fantastic job with this miniature,\
  \ making it look like it is actually made of stone, with little cracks and weathering\
  \ that add realism to this imposing figure. It looks a bit simple in the tiny photograph,\
  \ but the detail on this giant miniature is amazing. Karzoug Statues generally come\
  \ one per Huge case, making it a rare figure.</p> \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n    <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/20120427-Lamatar.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/20120427-Lamatar_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n   </div> \n   <p>Next up we have Lamatar Bayden, a one-time\
  \ commander of [SPOILER!] who saw better days as a hopeless romantic. Now, his command\
  \ is lost, his romance is shattered, and he's trapped in the form of a hideous ice\
  \ wight. Accordingly, WizKids sculpted this miniature in clear plastic. Lamatar's\
  \ sharp icicle fingers and crown are completely clear, granting the rare miniature\
  \ a (wait for it) chilling effect.</p> \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    <a\
  \ href=\"/image/content/Blog/20120427-Ordikon.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/20120427-Ordikon_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n   </div> \n   <p>Lastly today we have one of the coolest miniatures\
  \ in the set, The Mithral Mage! This remnant from the ancient empire of the Runelords\
  \ has shiny mithral skin, which makes killing him a real pain late in the Rise of\
  \ the Runelords campaign. The detailed paint steps on The Mithral Mage's costume\
  \ really steal the show, here, and his dynamic pose perfectly suits his arrogant\
  \ and imposing personality. He's a rare miniature, and one of the major villains\
  \ of the last third of the campaign.</p> \n   <p>Looking over this blog, I'm reminded\
  \ what a deadly and awesome campaign the <a href=\"/products/btpy8mqq\">Rise of\
  \ the Runelords Adventure Path</a> really is. I'm thrilled to get a chance to create\
  \ a set of miniatures specifically to support the campaign, and I'm pleased that\
  \ the 65-figure size of the set allows us the chance to include a few cool campaign-specific\
  \ miniatures like the ones previewed in this blog.</p> \n   <p>Next week I think\
  \ I'll jump back to monsters, and show off a few minis no one has even guessed are\
  \ in the set, yet! </p> \n   <p>See you then!</p> \n   <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p>\
