  \ Delving into Dwarves and the Darklands</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Wednesday,\

  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>There are certain figures within fantasy tales that are\
  \ immediately recognizable or familiar when they appear in a scene. Wizards... dragons...\
  \ elves... </p> \n    <p>Dwarves.</p> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Ask most\
  \ people to describe a dwarf and they'll likely touch on many similar points: short,\
  \ gruff, warriors, lovers of gold, gems, and frothy mugs of ale. We see this time\
  \ and again throughout books, movies, and video games. It's an iconic image, and\
  \ it might be easy to leave it at that since it's such a familiar representation—\
  as well as one many have come to love.</p> \n    <p>But just as with a true dwarven\
  \ city, those surface level identifiers conceal many hidden depths. With Forge of\
  \ Ashes, I wanted to be true to particular iconic elements while also delving beyond\
  \ the \"typical\" and providing greater insight into unique parts of dwarven lore,\
  \ culture, and passion. Yes, there are still aspects that make dwarves... well...\
  \ dwarves! Their earthen origins. Their predilection for mining and turning the\
  \ stones themselves into grand works of art that are equally fantastic and functional.\
  \ The beards.</p> \n    <p>But what I love about the world of Golarion and Pathfinder\
  \ itself is the emphasis on diversity. There's the recognition that even while certain\
  \ races or species might share baseline characteristics there's going to be infinite\
  \ opportunity for variety among them. Yes, dwarves can be warriors. But they can\
  \ also be scholars and artists, commoners and royalty, priests and scoundrels. They\
  \ can be courageous... brash... broken... greedy... selfless... </p> \n    <p>The\
  \ central figure of <em>Forge of Ashes</em>, Akina, holds a questioning perspective\
  \ about her kin and her place among them. After years fighting abroad, she's lost\
  \ her way somewhat and is coming home to try and regain a sense of self and purpose\
  \ (though that hardly goes as well as planned). So her interaction with dwarven\
  \ culture and environs is both familiar and yet an exploration in itself. That was\
  \ part of why I had immense fun writing Forge of Ashes! It was an opportunity to\
  \ go deeper, both literally and figuratively.</p> \n    <p>Beyond the focus on dwarves,\
  \ <em>Forge of Ashes</em> held many delights for me as an author. The chance to\
  \ venture into the Darklands and bring its many strange denizens to life was a great\
  \ creative challenge and adventure in itself. I loved getting to peek into the enigmatic\
  \ nature of the dark stalker, Izthuri, and her people, as well as the maddening\
  \ chaos found within a derro warren. There's a unique discourse with a roper that...\
  \ well, let's just say it boggled my brain to write. And even the infamous rust\
  \ monster has a small-yet-vital role in certain scenes!</p> \n    <p>So, join me\
  \ in an adventure full of monsters, magic, and mayhem. Where some things are immediately\
  \ recognizable but then quickly take a turn to devious and deadly ends. It's time\
  \ to discover deeper levels of dwarven identity... </p> \n    <p>... and deeper\
  \ levels of the Darklands, where someone or something is always waiting around the\
  \ next tunnel corner—most likely to eat you!</p> \n    <p>Josh Vogt<br> <i>Pathfinder\
