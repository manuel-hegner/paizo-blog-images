  \ Amanda Hamon Kunz and Jason Keeley teamed up as the lead developers of <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9qhp?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Heroes-of-the-High-Court\"><em>Heroes\
  \ of the High Court</em></a>, a Pathfinder Player Companion that takes adventurers\
  \ to the royal courts and noble houses of Golarion. Let's see what they have to\
  \ say about the lords and ladies of high society.</p> \n    <h2>Jason</h2> \n  \
  \  <p>This was the first book that I did a major amount of development on, having\
  \ spent a few years in the word mines of editingâ€”a place that holds a very special\
  \ place in my heart and to which calls to me still. And I have to give major thanks\
  \ to Amanda, who made sure I didn't spend my whole time on this project alphabetizing\
  \ everything. It was exciting to take the glittering ideas fresh from our freelancer's\
  \ minds and altering them to fit the needs of the product, much like a bespoke tailor\
  \ creating a velvet doublet for his noble patron.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\"\

  \ \n    <p>Speaking of clothes, we all know how much those courtly types enjoy their\
  \ fashion, so of course <em>Heroes of the High Court</em> touches on this important\
  \ facet. From mundane attire such as long, silk gloves that grant bonuses against\
  \ contact poisons to magical accessories such as a fashionable shawl that provides\
  \ the wearer with her own illusory entourage, you'll be able to dress to impress.\
  \ Once so attired, you might look half as nice as the silksworn, an occultist archetype\
  \ that trades dusty ancient implements for ostentatious garments and expensive magic\
  \ items. A silksworn casts spells as a spontaneous arcane spellcaster, and actually\
  \ gets a few more spells per day than the regular occultist. He even gains a bonus\
  \ on Bluff and Diplomacy checks depending on how much fancy clothing he's wearing.\
  \ I mean, just look at Mavaro here! Isn't he fabulous?!</p> \n    <h2>Amanda</h2>\
  \ \n    <p>For me, one of the most fun parts of character creation is coming up\
  \ with a deep and intricate origin story. It might never come up in play, but my\
  \ characters always have weird reasons for adventuring, and for being in specific\
  \ locations when their adventures start. More than one has had traceable ties to\
  \ a legendary hero (or has just made up a story and passed it off as fact!).</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Regardless, <em>Heroes of the High Court</em> is rich in mechanical tools\
  \ for building nearly any specific noble character you can imagine. The book accomplishes\
  \ this in a lot of ways, but one of the most interesting is an expansion of the\
  \ Noble Scion feat from the <a href=\"/products/btpy8ief\"><em>Inner Sea World Guide</em></a>.\
  \ The original feat gives you a mechanical benefit at 1st level based on the broad\
  \ flavor of your character's noble family, but in Heroes of the High Court, we go\
  \ a step further. With this expansion of the feat, characters can gain a mechanical\
  \ benefit based on the actual nation from which their noble family hails.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Is your character, for instance, a member of frosty noble family from Irrisen?\
  \ If they take the Noble Scion feat, they can reduce the amount of nonlethal damage\
  \ taken from exposure to cold by 4 points (minimum 0). If they're from shadowy Nidal,\
  \ they can gain low-light vision, or a +2 bonus on Perception checks in areas of\
  \ dim light, and if they're from Taldor, they can gain a +2 bonus on Charisma-based\
  \ checks when interacting with nobles or members of a noble court.</p> \n    <p>The\
  \ Noble Scion options are really just a drop in the bucket of mechanical options\
  \ that <em>Heroes of the High Court</em> offers to noble characters. <a href=\"\
