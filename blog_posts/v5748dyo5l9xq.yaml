  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Wednesday, September 17, 2008</p> \n   <p>In the Darklands\
  \ of Golarion, there are three regions. The uppermost one is known as Nar-Voth;\
  \ this is the \"wilderness\" of the Darklands. The races who live here are relatively\
  \ isolated, tribal, or small. The duergar are an exception, of course, but that's\
  \ only because they have a bunch of abandoned pre-made dwarf cities to squat in.\
  \ Below Nar-Voth lies the largest realmâ€”Sekamina. This one's the classic underground\
  \ warren of tunnels that span continents that long-time gamers will find the most\
  \ familiar. The drow are the primary race here, but there are others like the skum,\
  \ the serpentfolk, ghouls, and morlocks.</p> \n   <p>Then there's the third realm.\
  \ The deepest realm. This is where we transition from the classic underground RPG\
  \ realm back into the pulps, for the most part. In this realm, known as Orv, there\
  \ are many immense caverns known as Vaults. Golarion doesn't have a Hollow World\
  \ or an Edgar Rice Burroughs style Pellucidar per se, but these vaults are big enough\
  \ to stand in for those regions. Underground oceans, caverns with jungles and artificial\
  \ suns, entire nations of warmongering humanoids, and regions containing mountain\
  \ ranges and vast deserts but deep under the earth dominate Orv, and the denizens\
  \ of the upper Darklands think of the vaults with the same sense of fear and wonder\
  \ that surface folk do for them. Orv is sort of a Darkland for the Darklands.</p>\
  \ \n   <p><a href=\"/store/v5748btpy81tu\"><i>Into the Darklands</i></a> covers\
  \ the races and major locations for all three of these realms, but of the three,\
  \ it was Orv that I was the most excited to see come alive. The enormous lost worlds\
  \ of deep underground are a classic trope of the genre, but not one that's been\
  \ done all that much in the game. Certainly not much in <i>Pathfinder</i> until\
  \ now; we've had our share of big dungeons and cave systems already, but now? Now\
  \ it's time for immense underground deserts ruled by undead drow, dinosaur-infested\
  \ jungles where cavemen and troglodytes squabble over the best (and safest) places\
  \ to live, and oh yeah... areas ruled by classic monsters like intellect devourers\
  \ and giant worms!</p> \n   <p>James Jacobs <br> <i>Pathfinder</i> Editor-in-Chief</p>\
