  description\">From androids manipulating reality with technomagic to goblins in\
  \ spacesuits wielding barely functioning laser pistols, the Starfinder RPG covers\
  \ the majority of weird and exciting science-fantasy tropes. But it would be a poor\
  \ game that takes place among the stars if it didn't have starships! Luckily, Starfinder\
  \ gives you all you need to play the crew of an intrepid vessel exploring the galaxy—\
  and getting into trouble along the way.</p> \n    <p>The universe is not always\
  \ a friendly place and there are forces out there, from freebooting space pirates\
  \ to a whole fleet of undead soldiers, who either want to incapacitate your starship\
  \ and take your stuff or just blow you out of the void. And of course, you're not\
  \ going to roll over and let that happen! That's where Starfinder's robust starship\
  \ combat system comes into play.</p> \n    <p>While it has some similarities to\
  \ character-versus-monster combat, starship combat boasts a number of unique and\
  \ interesting features. It would be impossible to explore every detail in one blog\
  \ (you'll just have to buy the book to find out more!), but we'd like to give you\
  \ a taste of what you can expect come August.</p> \n    <p>When your characters\
  \ first board their starship, each player chooses one of five roles for his or her\
  \ character: captain, engineer, gunner, pilot, or science officer. Only one character\
  \ each can be the captain and the pilot, but depending on the configuration of your\
  \ vessel, you may want multiple engineers or gunners. Each role gives the character\
  \ assuming it a number of actions she can perform during the battle. The captain\
  \ can give encouraging speeches or make demands of the rest of the crew, granting\
  \ valuable bonuses. A science officer can scan enemy ships and target specific systems\
  \ on those vessels. An engineer can boost power to the engines or repair a malfunctioning\
  \ weapon. A gunner fires the ship's weapons at the enemy, taking precise shots or\
  \ unleashing a volley of lasers.</p> \n    <p>All that is exciting and vital to\
  \ the success of the fight, but as Iseph would be quick to remind you, you'd still\
  \ be a sitting duck without the impressive things the pilot can do!</p> \n    <p>The\
  \ pilot has the important job of moving the PCs' starship across the hex-grid map\
  \ that starship combat uses, ensuring that gunners can shoot the ship's biggest\
  \ weapons at the most dangerous enemies while hopefully making sure that those foes\
  \ don't have the opportunity to shoot back. Getting the positioning and facing of\
  \ the ship right is crucial, as is knowing what the ship is capable of doing and\
  \ then pushing it beyond its limits.</p> \n    <p>To that end, pilots have access\
  \ to a whole suite of stunts—daring maneuvers that only the skilled can hope to\
  \ pull off. Of course, if the situation doesn't call for any of these fancy tactics,\
  \ the pilot can always fly normally or step on the gas for an extra burst of speed.\
  \ The basic pilot stunts are:</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><b>Back Off</b>:\
  \ The pilot throws the ship into reverse, moving backward a few hexes.</p> \n  \
  \   <p><b>Barrel Roll</b>: By spinning the ship on its axis, the pilot allows the\
  \ ships's port guns and shields to function on the starboard side and vice versa\
  \ for 1 round. Hope your artificial gravity is turned on!</p> \n     <p><b>Evade</b>:\
  \ This stunt encompasses the standard dodging maneuvers, making the ship harder\
  \ to hit for 1 round. But it doesn't shake those pesky target lock-ons!</p> \n \
  \    <p><b>Flip and Burn</b>: The pilot moves the vessel forward a bit and turns\
  \ it 180 degrees, surprising enemies who might have been in its wake.</p> \n   \
  \  <p><b>Flyby</b>: A dangerous stunt, this takes your ship very close to an enemy\
  \ vessel (through its hex), which lets a gunner fire any of his ship's weapons at\
  \ any shield arc of the foe, regardless of where the two ships end their movement.\
  \ Executing this stunt poorly allows the enemy vessel to get a free shot on you!</p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>Slide</b>: The pilot moves the ship at an angle without changing\
  \ the way it is facing, like a racecar drifting. This stunt is very useful for ships\
  \ that aren't very maneuverable.</p> \n     <p><b>Turn in Place</b>: Firing up maneuvering\
  \ thrusters, the pilot alters the direction the ship is facing without moving it\
  \ from its hex, possibly allowing a specific weapon to make an all-important shot.</p>\
  \ \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Especially talented pilots can also attempt an \"\
  audacious gambit,\" flying the ship in ways never intended by those who built it.\
  \ But you'd have to be crazy to try something like that!</p> \n    <p>Since a pilot\
  \ is nothing without a ship to helm, the <em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em> also\
  \ presents both rules for customizing your own starship and a handful of prebuilt\
  \ starships ready for PCs to use or fight. Shown here are just two examples.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The Drone Mk III is a smaller ship fabricated by shirren manufacturer\
  \ Starhive. As befits their name, Drones are extremely common and used as freighters,\
  \ personnel transports, light colonial defense vessels, and more. Despite the ships'\
  \ mass production, Starhive takes a natural shirren pride in making sure each ship's\
  \ iridescent paint job is unique.</p> \n    <p>Built by the vesk munitions company\
  \ Vindicas, the Tyrant is a dreadnought feared across multiple star systems. Huge\
  \ weapon batteries tear through even the most formidable capital ships, while its\
  \ hangars unleash squadrons of fighters to mop up foes too insignificant to be worth\
  \ the Tyrant's direct attention.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a\
