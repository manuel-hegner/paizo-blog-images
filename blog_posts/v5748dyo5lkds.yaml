  \ itemprop=\"articlebody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Every year goes by\
  \ so quickly, yet every year I end up looking back and realizing just how long it's\
  \ been—and how much we've accomplished—since January. 2017's no exception. All the\
  \ work that went into getting Starfinder Society going, we've been keeping busy\
  \ bringing you more stories, adventures, art, and memories in Pathfinder Society\
  \ Roleplaying Guild. While we've enjoyed all of the scenarios, there's a handful\
  \ that I feel really defined 2017.</p> \n    <p>This year we tried something new:\
  \ publishing a new series of quests mid-season. <a href=\"/products/btpy9qcb?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-816-House-of-Harmonious-Wisdom\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-16: House of Harmonious Wisdom</em></a> really\
  \ knocked it out of the park, and the positive feedback has encouraged use to launch\
  \ a similar series in early 2018.</p> \n    <p>Season 8 was our opportunity to travel\
  \ to the elemental planes, and we scheduled two scenarios on each plane with an\
  \ aim to present one urban adventure and one \"wilderness\" adventure. To me, <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy9reu?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-819-Treacherous-Waves\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-19: Treacherous Waves</em></a> by Eleanor Ferron\
  \ really captured the flavor of the elemental planes and of Vialesk, the foremost\
  \ city on the Plane of Water, with colorful characters and daring scenes that flit\
  \ between dry and wet environments.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    \

  \ and Giorgio Baroni</i></p>\n    </div> \n    <p>Every season comes to an end,\
  \ and we try to bring everything together with a bang—often in a confrontation with\
  \ loathsome foes. Ever since the \"All for Immortality\" series, we've scheduled\
  \ at least one Tier 12+ scenario per season. For Season 8 we knew our goal from\
  \ the very beginning, and we knew it was a worthy challenge for our seeker-level\
  \ characters: break open the Untouchable Opal and free the being trapped within.\
  \ The result, <a href=\"/products/btpy9tl9?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-825-Unleashing-the-Untouchable\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-25: Unleashing the Untouchable</em></a>, is\
  \ a truly epic adventure by Robert Brookes.</p> \n    <p>Multi-table interactive\
  \ specials are pretty great, but they're also an immense amount of work to assemble.\
  \ To both deliver more multi-table content and change up our traditional format,\
  \ we created a \"modular special\" with easily replaced parts that we can swap out\
  \ with new content over time. <a href=\"/products/btpy9s15?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-899-The-Solstice-Scar-Version-A\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Special #8-99: The Solstice Scar</em></a> tread new ground\
  \ with Andrew Hoskins as the author, and we've already finished the next installment\
  \ that's set to appear at conventions beginning in mid-January.</p> \n    <p>Speaking\
  \ of multi-table interactive specials, no retrospective's complete without the Gen\
  \ Con centerpiece. This year Absalom itself came under attack in <a href=\"/products/btpy9tld?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-900-Assault-on-Absalom\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Special #9-00: Assault on Absalom</em></a> by Mikko Kallio,\
  \ and the Pathfinder Society's factions pooled their resources and expertise to\
  \ help fight off the invasion. This was one of the smoothest-run specials yet!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The Season of Factions' Favor kicked off with a trio of great scenarios,\
  \ and one in particular really set the tone for Season 9. <a href=\"/products/btpy9tlb?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-902-A-Case-of-Missing-Persons\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #9-02: A Case of Missing Persons</em></a> by Alex\
  \ Greenshields continues the ongoing saga of Major Colson Maldris, and the looks\
  \ of disbelief I've seen on people's faces when they play this one... they give\
  \ me life. The Liberty's Edge struggle this scenario introduces also kicked off\
  \ our <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ljz1?Leaders-in-Liberty\">Leaders in Liberty</a>\
  \ contest and voting. I can hardly wait for the next installment in Spring 2018.</p>\

  \ \n    <p>The elemental planes have plenty of conflict, and conflict begets adventures.\
  \ Heaven's a different story, as it's easy to think that no matter what happens\
  \ there, a horde of archons is ready to jump on it. For more than a year we'd been\
  \ considering an adventure in Heaven an unattainable goal... then we checked the\
  \ reporting data for a Season 7 scenario and saw that participants had overwhelmingly\
  \ chosen exactly that. Thus began <a href=\"/products/btpy9weq?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-906-The-Shores-of-Heaven\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #9-06: The Shores of Heaven</em></a>, a delightful\
  \ and heavenly story that brought out the plane's potential in a compelling way\
  \ with compelling characters. Cole Kronewitter did an excellent job.</p> \n    <p>Just\
  \ as some factions are struggling with leadership or learning to flex their muscles\
  \ in new ways, others are tackling an internal threat that threatens to destroy\
  \ the organization entirely. The Scarab Sages got to show off their strength and\
  \ destroy an ancient evil in <a href=\"/products/btpy9wer?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-907-Salvation-of-the-Sages\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #9-07: Salvation of the Sages</em></a>, one of\
  \ the most extraordinarily fun and over-the-top scenarios I've had the pleasure\
  \ to develop in a long while. Just as he helped kick off the Scarab Sages storyline\
  \ in Season 5 and drive it forward in Season 6, I enjoyed having Matt Duval to tie\
  \ things together with this adventure.</p> \n    <p>Ever since The Confirmation,\
  \ no season's been complete without a new replayable (aka evergreen) scenario. Last\
  \ year we published the first replayable adventure above 1st level, and we knew\
  \ that this year we wanted to provide a similarly compelling mid-level experience.\
  \ Brian Duckwitz delivered with <a href=\"/products/btpy9x0t?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-909-Beyond-the-Halflight-Path\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #9-09: Beyond the Halflight Path</em></a>, which\
  \ delves deep below the eclectic city of Kaer Maga in pursuit of numerous objectives\
  \ that change with each retelling.</p> \n    <p>And even with this long list I'm\
  \ omitting tons of great adventures, from Mike Kimmel's trip under Merab's streets\
  \ to Crystal Malarsky's archaeological peacekeeping mission to Larry Wilhelm's voyage\
  \ into a live volcano to many, many more. What were your favorites?</p> \n    <p>Finally,\
  \ no season's complete without some excellent artwork. Here are some of our favorites\
  \ from 2017, compliments of Akim Kaliberda, Giorgio Baroni, Hannah Boving, Josef\
  \ Kucera, Sebastian Rodriguez, and Tom Ventre. Also, although I don't want to provide\
  \ spoilers by posting it here, we also adore Sean MacDonald's cartography from <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy9rev?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-820-Torrents-Last-Will\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-20: Torrent's Last Will</em></a>, for which\
  \ I've seen some of the most dazzling printed maps.</p> \n    <p>See you in 2018!</p>\
