  \      <p>This adventure started out as a conversation in Starfinder team chat.\
  \ We knew we wanted to create an adventure starring Zo!, so we started brainstorming\
  \ potential themes and hooks. My colleague Dustin has always wondered about a specific\
  \ detail of the Starfinder setting: Why does the undead celebrity Zo! share a name\
  \ with the magnificent Triaxian port city of Zo? Is it coincidence, or some deeper\
  \ lore? This question was on his mind as we tossed out weird ideas for another televised\
  \ adventure.</p>\n      <p>Eventually, he brought it up.</p>\n      <br>\n     \

  \      <br>\n      <p>And the rest is history.</p>\n      <p>Beyond this wacky conversation,\
  \ my inspiration for Zo! vs. Zo included too many hours of Judge Judy, listening\
  \ to a friend’s retellings of Ace Attorney games, and simply imagining what a TV\
  \ court drama would look like on a planet with real dragons and semi-legal combat\
  \ between residents. Triaxus (the planet) has lots of high fantasy themes, so I\
  \ started thinking about what a typical fantasy concept like trial by combat would\
  \ be like in Starfinder. I decided literal legal battles would probably be fought\
  \ by combat lawyers hired to represent their clients. From that, another idea formed:\
  \ What if the player characters act as Zo!’s combat lawyers in his legal case against\
  \ the city? I thought that sounded truly outrageous, so that’s how I designed the\
  \ adventure. If you’d like to experience more of my work, my favorites are <em>Mechageddon!,</em>\
  \ a Starfinder First Edition Adventure Path about playing a squad of mech pilots\
  \ defending their home world from kaiju, and <em>A Cosmic Birthday</em>, a Starfinder\
  \ Second Edition adventure about surviving a disaster on Absalom Station. You can\
  \ also check out Starfinder Second Edition, launching now with <em>Starfinder</em><em>Galaxy\

  \ Archives of Eternity</em></h3>\n      <p>I am thrilled to have once again contributed\
  \ to Starfinder Society adventures with <em>7-06:</em><em>Archives of Eternity</em>.\
  \ I am also, as ever, grateful for the wonderful team who took my submission and\
  \ improved it in so many ways. It is always amazing to see the art that is produced,\
  \ as well as what the development and editing teams contribute. This was my first\
  \ time designing a map, and the difference between what I submitted and the full\
  \ art version was astounding. Metaplot adventures have their own challenges and\
  \ bring their own joys. It is fun to be part of a bigger storyline while also writing\
  \ a complete and independent adventure. Trying to think like and design for an alien\
  \ culture that I don’t know or understand pushed my creativity. I look forward to\
  \ the possibility of contributing to the new campaign when the time is right. Happy\
  \ gaming everyone.</p>\n      <br>\n      <h3>Kendra Leigh Speedling (she/her)</h3>\n\
  \      <h3><em>SFS1 #7-08: Envar’s Awesome Rescue</em></h3>\n      <p>Hello, all!\
  \ I’m Kendra Leigh Speedling, frequent contributor to Paizo. For Starfinder Society\
  \ this year, I got to return to everyone’s favorite(?) disaster influencer, Envar\
  \ Tamm, in <em>SFS #7-08: Envar’s Awesome Rescue</em>! Envar’s been plaguingdelighting\
  \ the Society for a while; my first outing with him was in <em>5-12: Envar’s Expeditions</em>,\
  \ and it was fun to see how he’s grown (or not, sometimes!) over the years. I do\
  \ have a soft spot for the guy, even when his judgment is questionable. My favorite\
  \ parts of <em>Envar’s Awesome Rescue</em> are 1) Envar critiquing the kidnappers’\
  \ ransom note and 2) a certain encounter where the scenario’s villain goes old school\
  \ damsel-tied-to-railroad-tracks on Envar’s poor body double. The scenario was a\
  \ blast to work on, and I hope you all have enjoyed playing it as much as I did\
  \ writing it.</p>\n      <p>I also got to co-write <em>7-11: Breaking the Crucible</em>,\
  \ where Starfinder agents have to stop a group of Hellknights from carrying out\
  \ terrible experiments against a captive population, which brought back some familiar\
  \ faces as well! Finally, I helped out with development on 7-09 through 7-14, and\
  \ it was fun to work on things from the dev side for once. The authors for those\
  \ all did a fantastic job, giving First Edition Starfinder Society a fitting sendoff!</p>\n\

  \ on <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01zn8?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-204-Futures-Fall\"\
  >Future’s Fall</a> I had no idea it would turn into me writing a multi-adventure\
  \ tale, and I’m so grateful that he and Jessica let me be a part of it. I have so\
  \ much admiration for Tom Phillips’ iconic Gloomspires story and this felt like\
  \ getting to do my own echo of that.</p>\n      <p><em>Clutches of the Vault Lord</em>\
  \ pulls together all the threads and characters of Salvation’s End in one climactic\
  \ confrontation with the tyrant. There are callbacks to almost every NPC we’ve met\
  \ along the way, more mishaps and bizarre vault experiments, a singing and dancing\
  \ living cartoon complete with theme song, and a final(?) clash with the Vault Lord.\
  \ I hope the adventure captures all the wacky, imaginative sci-fi we’ve come to\
  \ expect from Salvation’s End while giving the Starfinders a chance to demonstrate\
  \ their heroism against a classic villain who delights in their own wickedness.\
  \ And if that villain leaves no trace of a body in their last moment, rest assured\
  \ the echoing laughter you hear is only in your imagination…</p>\n      <p>If you’\
  d like to see more of my work, the Pathfinders get to thwart Hellknight schemes\

  \ (any)</h3>\n      <h3><em>SFS1 #7-10: Rasheen’s Requiem</em></h3>\n      <p>Howdy\
  \ folks. The name’s Solomon St. John—Sol to my friends, any pronouns are fine—and,\
  \ in addition to being Paizo’s editing lead for both Starfinder and Pathfinder Society,\
  \ this season I got to write <em>Starfinder Society Scenario 7-10: Rasheen’s Requiem.</em>\
  \ Helping wrap up a storyline that’s been running since season one felt like a satisfying\
  \ send-off to the first edition, even though there were half-a-dozen scenarios to\
  \ edit between it and the true finale.</p>\n      <p>I’m always excited when I get\
  \ to use my obscure master’s degree (in “Northern Studies,” a multidisciplinary\
  \ cultural studies program from the University of Alaska) on the job, which I got\
  \ with 7-10—the frontier settlement of Requiem Falls is essentially a sci-fi twist\
  \ on Alaskan bush communities. The NPCs you meet there, Elarora and Naeyri, are\
  \ likewise amalgamations of a few people I knew while living in Fairbanks, with\
  \ some science-fantasy twists. The “razor roc” on the cover, meanwhile, is only\
  \ loosely based on the birds up there, who <em>will</em> fight you but are thankfully\
  \ much smaller.</p>\n      <p>My next adventure, <em>Starfinder Society Scenario\
  \ #1-02: Mystery of the Frozen Moon</em> premiers at GenCon at the end of July with\
  \ the rest of the Starfinder Society Second Edition kick-off; as you can probably\
  \ guess from the name, that one also takes some cues from my degree, but you’ll\
  \ have to wait to find out exactly what.&nbsp;</p>\n      <p>For more of my upcoming\

  \ the finale to the season 7 metaplot, <em>#7-12: Those Who Call</em>, was exciting\
  \ and flattering, but also stressful because I knew I had to really stick the landing.\
  \ Sarmak, Kinpopo, and Hope-01 have been active participants in the players adventures,\
  \ more so than the usual quest giver or escort NPC, so I wanted to make them feel\
  \ like a part of the story while not taking spotlight and agency away from the players.</p>\n\
  \      <p>I wrote <em>Those Who Call</em> to be like a multitable special. I wanted\
  \ players to choose their adventure and feel the impact of the other team of Starfinders\
  \ on the mission. I also wanted it to feel like an action movie with a high sense\
  \ of urgency and mustache-twirling evil villains melodramatically monologuing.&nbsp;</p>\n\
  \      <p>My favorite part of the scenario was designing the factory itself. They\
  \ say write what you know, so I may have brought a sense of soullessness to a corporate\
  \ military industrial complex. It’s fine. I’m fine. Everything’s fine. I’m fine.\
  \ Hopefully the setting reinforced just how evil the First Ones are. If you’ve not\
  \ played yet, I recommend tackling the Logistics and Planning room.</p>\n      <p>When\
  \ I’m not writing for Starfinder or managing IT projects, I perform stand-up and\
  \ improv comedy. My debut stand up special, I Think I Get It Now, is on my youtube\
  \ channel @BrentBowser1337. And let me know what you think of The Swarm in <em>Starfinder\
