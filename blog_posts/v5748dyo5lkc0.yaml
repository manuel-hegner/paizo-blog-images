  \ and announcements you have come to expect from Paizo's official convention, but\
  \ it also featured a very special addition: the inaugural PaizoCon Puzzle Hunt.\
  \ Any could grab this packet of puzzles and mind-benders and solve them in their\
  \ spare moments, with the hopes of winning a special prize! A lot of you participated,\
  \ and everyone who got the correct final answer went home with a booster pack of\
  \ Pathfinder Miniatures. We had a blast presenting it to the con attendees, and\
  \ thanks to the magic of the internet, we are proud to present it here for you for\
  \ free! Check the link below, which contains everything you need to participate\
  \ in this Starfinder-themed puzzle hunt... except, of course, your wits. Unfortunately,\
  \ we can't offer any prizes for completing this puzzle hunt, but if you can make\
  \ it to PaizoCon 2018, we should have a brand-new set of challenges for you to tackle!</p>\

  ><b>Download the Puzzle Hunt!</b></a>â€”856 KB zip/PDF</p> \n    <h2>What is a puzzle\
  \ hunt?</h2> \n    <p>A puzzle hunt is a series of linked puzzles, with the answer\
  \ to each being a word or phrase. Those words and phrases are used in one more puzzle\
  \ to generate the hunt's final solution. Figuring out how this last puzzle works\
  \ is part of the challenge!</p> \n    <h2>Who made this, anyway?</h2> \n    <p>Why,\
  \ that's us, of course! Both of us have a deep, abiding love of puzzles, ranging\
  \ from crossword puzzles to the spatial puzzles you might find in an escape room\
  \ or the video game The Witness. We figured we had solved enough puzzles over the\
  \ years that we could design our own and present them in this puzzle hunt format.\
  \ We tried to get as many styles of puzzle into the hunt as we could: cryptograms,\
  \ word seeks, anagrams, etc. </p> \n    <p>The art for the Starfinder iconics featured\
  \ in this puzzle hunt is by Remko Troost.</p> \n    <h2>What do I do if get stuck?</h2>\
  \ \n    <p>First, put the puzzle down and come back at it in an hour or so with\
  \ a fresh mind. Perhaps you'll spot something you hadn't seen before. Be sure to\
  \ reread the instructions at the top of the page; sometimes clues are hidden in\
  \ there! If all that fails, feel free to ask for a hint on the messageboards. There's\
  \ no shame in getting a nudge from a fellow solver, and perhaps you can help her\
  \ in return with a different puzzle!</p> \n    <p>Jason Keeley and Joe Pasini<br>\
