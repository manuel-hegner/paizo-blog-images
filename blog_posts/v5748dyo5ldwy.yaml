  articleBody\"> \n    <p>Earlier this week WizKids brought by the case incentive\
  \ miniature for the upcoming Shattered Star set of prepainted <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids\"\
  >Pathfinder Battles</a> miniatures. In the previous set, \n     <link>Rise of the\
  \ Runelords, the incentive miniature was the enormous \n     <link>Rune Giant, which\
  \ lorded over the rest of the set and looked absolutely amazing doing it.</p> \n\
  \    <p>I can't say what the case incentive figure will be for <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/shatteredStar\"\
  >Shattered Star</a> yet (because I want to show you a painted sculpture for extra\
  \ jaw-droppage, and we're not quite there yet), but when we got a look at it, our\
  \ excitement for this set exploded to the next level, which is something I didn't\
  \ even think possible (we like the Shattered Star set an awful lot). </p> \n   \
  \ <p>So I can't show off that incredible miniature just yet. But I do have a couple\
  \ of other incredible figures this week to make up for it!</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  \ is the Iron Golem. This Large figure is based on a great illustration by Tyler\
  \ Walpole that I think captures a classic look for this iconic dungeon monster.\
  \ The paint job on this guy is relatively simple, but WizKids has made subtle choices\
  \ that make the simplicity work for it. The color of the creature's “iron” skin\
  \ has a sheen to it that really sells the metal effect, similar to the way the Karzoug\
  \ Statue in Rise of the Runelords really looked like it could have been made of\
  \ stone. Even better, the Iron Golem's eyes and mouth are painted in a sort of pearlescent\
  \ orange, giving the effect of smoldering fire within the sockets. WizKids brought\
  \ by a production sample of this figure at this week's meeting, and everyone commented\
  \ on how much they liked it. I think you'll like it too.</span></p> \n    <div class=\"\

  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>The Alchemical Golem from <a href=\"/products/btpy8hif\"\
  >Bestiary 2</a> is one of my favorite golems in the game, so it's fitting that the\
  \ Alchemical Golem from the Shattered Star set is one of my favorite prepainted\
  \ plastic miniatures in any set. This Large miniature is SERIOUSLY cool.</p> \n\
  \    <p>I count FIVE different colors of clear plastic on this figure, from the\
  \ green goo that fuels its body to the varicolored potions in its syringe fingers.\
  \ Best of all (and not really visible in this preview photo, alas), the clear dome\
  \ of the Alchemical Golem's head actually contains a little brain! Gross!</p> \n\
  \    <p>Expect preorder pages for the Shattered Star set to appear very shortly\
  \ here on paizo.com, and it's not too early to ask your local retailer to make sure\
  \ they order enough copies of this set from their distributor.</p> \n    <p>It's\
  \ going to be a great one!</p> \n    <p>More next week.</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br>\
