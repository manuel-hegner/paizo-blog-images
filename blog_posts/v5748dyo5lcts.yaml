  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n   </div> \n   <p>We’re coming up on the release of <a href=\"\
  /store/v5748btpy8odu\"><i>Bestiary 3</i></a> in the near future, and as readers\
  \ of the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/jadeRegent\">Jade Regent Adventure\
  \ Path</a> have noticed, we’re already using monsters from that book in the adventures!\
  \ This is more or less a necessity, since when you travel to the far side of the\
  \ world, you expect to see brand-new creatures and monsters, after all. We’ve been\
  \ filling the Jade Regent bestiaries with all sorts of monsters inspired from Asian\
  \ mythology and folklore, but we need more—and that’s where <i>Bestiary 3</i> comes\
  \ in.</p> \n   <p>One of the new types of monsters introduced in <i>Bestiary 3</i>\
  \ and the Jade Regent Adventure Path are the kami—usually (but not always) benevolent\
  \ native outsiders who exist to protect that which cannot really protect itself\
  \ from the advance of humanity and civilization. <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy8ow9\"\
  >Pathfinder #52</a> and <i>Bestiary 3</i> present several kami, ranging from CR\
  \ 2 all the way up to CR 20.</p> \n   <p>Presented below are two of the kami who\
  \ have roles to play in “Forest of Spirits.” We’re simply presenting their statistics\
  \ here—what roles they play in the adventure must remain a secret until you play\
  \ it or run it for your group!</p> \n   <p><b>Kami Subtype:</b> Kami are a race\
  \ of native outsiders who serve to protect what they refer to as “wards”—animals,\
  \ plants, objects, and even locations—from being harmed or dishonored. All kami\
  \ are outsiders with the native subtype. A kami possesses the following traits unless\
  \ otherwise noted in a creature’s entry.</p> \n   <ul>\n    <li>Immune to bleed,\
  \ mind-affecting effects, petrification, and polymorph effects.</li> \n    <li>Resist\
  \ acid 10, electricity 10, fire 10</li> \n    <li>Although they are native outsiders,\
  \ kami do not eat, drink, or breathe.</li> \n    <li>Telepathy.</li> \n    <li><i>Fast\
  \ Healing (Ex)</i> As long as a kami is within 120 feet of its ward, it gains fast\
  \ healing. The amount of fast healing it gains depends on the type of kami.</li>\
  \ \n    <li><i>Merge with Ward (Su)</i> As a standard action, a kami can merge its\
  \ body and mind with its ward. When merged, the kami can observe the surrounding\
  \ region with its senses as if it were using its own body, as well as via any senses\
  \ its ward might have. It has no control over its ward, nor can it communicate or\
  \ otherwise take any action other than to emerge from its ward as a standard action.\
  \ A kami must be adjacent to its ward to merge with or emerge from it. If its ward\
  \ is a creature, plant, or object, the kami can emerge mounted on the creature provided\
  \ the kami’s body is at least one size category smaller than the creature. If its\
  \ ward is a location, the kami may emerge at any point within that location.</li>\
  \ \n    <li><i>Ward (Su)</i> A kami has a specific ward—a creature with an Intelligence\
  \ score of 2 or lower (usually an animal or vermin), a plant (not a plant creature),\
  \ an object, or a location. The type of ward is listed in parentheses in the kami’\
  s stat block. Several of a kami’s abilities function only when it is either merged\
  \ with its ward or within 120 feet of it. If a kami’s ward is portable and travels\
  \ with the kami to another plane, the kami does not gain the extraplanar subtype\
  \ on that other plane as long as its ward remains within 120 feet. If a ward is\
  \ destroyed while a kami is merged with it, the kami dies (no save). If a ward is\
  \ destroyed while a kami is not merged with it, the kami loses its merge with ward\
  \ ability and its fast healing, and becomes permanently sickened.</li>\n   </ul>\

  \ As a swift action, a zuishin can infuse an arrow it fires to carry any of the\
  \ following effects: <i>breath of life, cure light wounds, heal, neutralize poison,\
  \ remove curse, remove disease,</i> or <i>restoration</i>. Using one of these effects\
  \ consumes a use of the same spell-like ability. The zuishin must make a touch attack\
  \ to deliver the effect to the target—the target takes no damage from the arrow.\n\
  \   <br> <b>Holy Weapons (Su)</b> Any weapon wielded by a zuishin is treated as\
  \ if it had the <i>holy</i> special ability. A zuishin creates arrows out of nothing\
  \ as part of its attacks with any bow it wields.\n   <p></p> \n   <p>James Jacobs<br>\
