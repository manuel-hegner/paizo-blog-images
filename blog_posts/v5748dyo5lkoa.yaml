  \    <p itemprop=\"description\"><i>Today's PACG Homebrew Special&nbsp;blog is by\
  \ Todd Alexander (Wilbur_Whatley),&nbsp;about a homebrew of a different kind. Todd\
  \ wanted a new surface on which&nbsp;he could play our game and... well, he made\
  \ something everyone in our office now wants. Take a look.</i></p> \n     <p>I've\
  \ been a fan of the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game for a few years now. My entire\
  \ family played Rise of the Runelords, my wife and I played through Wrath of the\
  \ Righteous, and I've played everything I could solo. All those decks and cards\
  \ and layouts were getting hard to manage on the dining room table, and after fighting\
  \ the cat for room on the table—again—it occurred to me it would be great to have\
  \ my cards up off the table.</p> \n     <p>I had been surfing for Pathfinder images\
  \ for a different project when I came across some photos of people making really\
  \ cool custom boards for their favorite CCGs, and from there, the ideas began to\
  \ flow. By the next night, I had come up with an exacting blueprint encompassing\
  \ some of the ideas I'd been having fun with. (Warning: I can't draw a stick figure!)</p>\

  ></a> \n     </div> \n     <p>The next weekend I found myself escorting the family\
  \ to the local crafts store. I spotted some foam board for school presentations\
  \ and remembered those homemade die-rolling towers I'd seen online. From there I\
  \ walked around trying to imagine how everything in the store might work as part\
  \ of a diorama. I picked up a couple sheets of moss and some pillars intended for\
  \ a wedding cake. When I got home, I borrowed the lazy Susan from the kitchen, which\
  \ made things easier to reach and work on. That also made it a circle, which really\
  \ drove a lot of the implementation of things. A lot of what followed was more out\
  \ of necessity than design. That also meant it evolved as I put it together, which\
  \ was fun to watch.</p> \n     <p>It changed even more after we used it a few times.\
  \ My attempt at water turned out to be not just a mess but also sticky and oily.\
  \ Lesson learned: stick with modelling tools and supplies! I ended up covering the\
  \ whole base in moss, which has turned out be a lot easier to use. It also made\
  \ things look more like a miniature place that could be real, rather than just a\
  \ rotating board.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180329-Photo4.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>That brought me to the next step in my Tower of Doom:\
  \ greeblies. I had heard that term on an Adam Savage vlog and it clicked. Greeblies\
  \ are tiny little details that movie effects artists add to props and models to\
  \ make them more complex and multi-layered. They often take them from old model\
  \ kits they keep around for this purpose. Well, I'm a geek—I have plenty of little\
  \ things around the house that I could use, like a gargoyle kitchen magnet that\
  \ is now a fallen piece of rubble. That was next to the Kyra figure I had from playing\
  \ Mummy's Mask. Nearby was a Cthulhu miniature I picked up at Comic-Con.</p> \n\
  \     <p>Speaking of Cthulhu, I used a website to translate H.P. Lovecraft's famous\
  \ quote “That is not dead which can eternal lie, and with strange eons even death\
  \ may die” into J.R.R. Tolkien's dwarf runes, and copied that onto the base. (Told\
  \ you I was a geek.) I was bothered by the plainness of the board—those petrified\
  \ stone pillars were begging for some extra moss effect... and there's always room\
  \ for magic runes. The diorama nature of the board and the miniature props give\
  \ it a multilayered look that I love to look at when we play.</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>The top section is for rolling dice and holding the\
  \ blessings deck. It would need to support a fair amount of weight, so I used the\
  \ four wedding cake columns from my craft store run. I glued the column bases to\
  \ a center stand I made to give the tower a little extra height. I attached a thin\
  \ lazy Susan to the column tops, so the top section swivels independent of the main\
  \ base, which is on the lazy Susan I took from the kitchen. Having access to every\
  \ part of the die roll tower while fighting goblins is pretty handy! I added short\
  \ foam board walls around the top so the dice wouldn't roll off. I lined a piece\
  \ of cardboard with shelf paper, giving it the look of a stone floor. Toothpicks\
  \ became wooden beams sticking out of the stone walls. As we've played, I've made\
  \ a few changes, adding a little moss here and a Supernatural pin there. I haven't\
  \ had to make any big fixes—I suggest a lot of Gorilla Glue if you try something\
  \ like this.</p> \n     <p>It has added a lot of atmosphere as we spin it to play\
  \ a scenario. While my family and I made this, I'd like to thank Mike Selinker and\
  \ everyone at Paizo for giving us the inspiration. I'm off to make a new Adventure\
  \ Path to play on this nifty board...</p> \n     <p><i>Todd Alexander</i></p> \n\
