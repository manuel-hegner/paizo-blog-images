  \      <h3>Steven Hammond (he/they)</h3>\n      <p>Hello! I'm <b>Steven Hammond</b>\
  \ (he/they). I've been a contributor to numerous Pathfinder books and scenarios.\
  \ I wrote the entry on Vulot for <em>War of Immortals</em>. Folklore is very near\
  \ and dear to me, and I tried to lean into it when writing Vulot. I wanted to communicate\
  \ the menace and danger of them in a way that felt organic, like it had been discovered\
  \ in some dusty cabinet in Sandpoint. I'm really proud of the result, and I'm so\
  \ honored to have been part of the fantastic team that worked on this book.</p>\n\
  \      <br>\n      <h3>Steven T. Helt</h3>\n      <p><b>Steven T. Helt</b> has been\
  \ a Paizo contributor since 2013 when he won that year's RPG Superstar talent search.\
  \ Since then, he's contributed to a number of products as author, designer, developer,\
  \ and editor. Most of his credits are in the role of Famine of the Four Horsemen\
  \ group, with dozens of products under his belt. His Paizo credits since Pathfinder\
  \ Second Edition include the Kingmaker Adventure Path and <em>War of Immortals</em>,\
  \ where he designed the apocalypse rider mythic destiny and the terrifying Weaver\
  \ of Webs. You can let him know all about your character's tragic demise right here\

  \ to add to the lore of the Oliphaunt of Jandelay, and update the rules for the\
  \ Oliphaunt for Pathfinder Second Edition play. I also enjoyed working with <b>Matt\
  \ Chapmond</b> to bring the seneschal witch to life. It’s exciting to see these\

  \ chain mythic destiny, and I loved every little piece of lore and crunch that went\
  \ into it, so I hope it shows. As a Latin American author, the topic of revolution\
  \ and standing up to tyrants permeates our collective history, and even still our\
  \ present in some LatAm nations, so I had a lot to draw from. If you liked the broken\
  \ chain, you might like <a href=\"https://www.ajneuro.com/pf2freecontent\">more\

  \ I am one of the co-founders of Team+, which is where I spend most of my time writing\

  \ Bestiary: Strange and Unusual</em>, the <em>Gardener's Guide to Gaming</em>, and\
  \ a few other projects on DriveThruRPG and Pathfinder Infinite. What time I don't\
  \ spend being a software engineer and father, I spend writing (mostly for TTRPGs).\
  \ I wrote the beast lord mythic destiny, which was a lot of fun to write since I\
  \ am a huge fan of companions and familiars in Pathfinder. Lucky to be a part of\
  \ such a stacked team of authors.</p>\n      <br>\n      <h3>Ruvaid Virk</h3>\n\
  \      <p>Hi, I'm <b>Ruvaid Virk</b> (he/him)! You may know me from previous awesome\
  \ Paizo books such as the <em>Lost Omens Tian Xia Character + World Guides</em>,\
  \ <em>Lost Omens Impossible Lands</em>, or <em>Dark Archive</em>, to name a few.\
  \ For this particular awesome Paizo book, I had a bloody good time working on the\
  \ bloodrager class archetype! I'm quite excited for you all to play with the archetype,\
  \ and for future stories with Trzikhun, the new bloodrager iconic! If you want to\
