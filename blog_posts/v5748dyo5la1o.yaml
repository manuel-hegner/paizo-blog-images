  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, March 4, 2008</p> \n   <p>The galley proofs for\
  \ Gary Gygax's novel, <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7zdq\">The Samarkand Solution</a>,\
  \ are sitting on my desk right now, ready for the final check-off before we send\
  \ the book to the printer. Sitting above my desk, packed into little cardboard sleeves,\
  \ are dozens of copies of <i>Dragon</i>, the original RPG magazine for which Gygax\
  \ served as publisher in its earliest days. Until recently, I served as publisher\
  \ of that magazine, and it always made me proud to know I was following in Gary\
  \ Gygax's august footsteps. </p> \n   <p>Gary died this morning in his sleep, bringing\
  \ to an end a decades-spanning career that created an industry and brought joy to\
  \ millions of people. The game he created with Dave Arneson&amp;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&amp;has\
  \ had a more profound influence upon my life than any other factor save my family,\
  \ and his passing has affected me deeply. </p> \n   <p>When I was a kid growing\
  \ up with D&amp;D, Gygax's name was on the cover of just about every official product.\
  \ He wrote the best adventure modules, he set the template for all future campaign\
  \ settings with the <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7meh\">World of Greyhawk</a>, and\
  \ perhaps most importantly he introduced a generation of kids to a game that was\
  \ more than a game. I've met many of my closest friends in the span of my entire\
  \ life because of Gary Gygax. </p> \n   <p>Last year, I launched <a href=\"/store/fiction/planetStories\"\
  >Planet Stories</a>, a line of fantasy and science-fiction trade paperbacks aimed\
  \ at reprinting some of the classic works of sword &amp; sorcery that inspired Dungeons\
  \ &amp; Dragons and fantasy gaming in general. In the <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7meo\"\
  >AD&amp;D Dungeon Master's Guide</a>, a fascinating work that surely serves as Gygax's\
  \ masterpiece, Gary thoughtfully included Appendix N: Inspirational and Educational\
  \ Reading, a list that included such luminaries as Michael Moorcock, Robert E. Howard,\
  \ Edgar Rice Burroughs, Lin Carter, Fritz Leiber, H. P. Lovecraft, A. Merritt, Jack\
  \ Vance, and more. </p> \n   <p>So in addition to my friends and my career, I also\
  \ owe Gary Gygax an unpayable debt of gratitude for introducing me to the greatest\
  \ fantasists who ever lived and a lifetime of excellent reading. Planet Stories\
  \ is, in some small sense, my attempt to repay that debt by bringing many of these\
  \ fine authors back into print to be enjoyed again. Like Paizo Publishing itself,\
  \ Planet Stories exists because of Gary Gygax. I chose to honor Gary by including\
  \ several of his own exciting fantasy novels in the Planet Stories line, including\
  \ the imprint's very first release, <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy80bn\">The Anubis\
  \ Murders</a>. </p> \n   <p>It was the release of <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy80bn\"\
  >The Anubis Murders</a> at last year's Gen Con Indy that brought me and Gary together\
  \ for the last time. As the show's Guest of Honor, Gygax had more than a full schedule,\
  \ but he was able to carve out a couple of hours a day to sit at the Paizo booth\
  \ and sign autographs of his book while sharing thoughts and memories with his fans.\
  \ And the stories those fans told were just incredible. For a full hour I listened\
  \ as gamer after gamer approached Gary and told a variation of the exact same story:\
  \ \"Thank you for a game that has brought me so much joy. Thank you for a game that\
  \ has brought me so many friends. Thank you for making such a positive impact on\
  \ my life.\" </p> \n   <p>Sitting next to Gary at last year's Gen Con made me realize\
  \ what a huge cultural impact Gary Gygax had made on all of us. Never before have\
  \ I seen such honest appreciation. Never before had I been so moved and so proud\
  \ to be working with a man who had made such an impact on my life. On all of our\
  \ lives. </p> \n   <p>When a friend passes away, it is easy to be sad, to think\
  \ about what might have been had he lived another year, another ten years. But my\
  \ friends, I am here to tell you that Gary Gygax knew what a difference he had made\
  \ in all of our lives, and he was proud to have made it. </p> \n   <p>Not bad for\
  \ a life's work. </p> \n   <p>I'll miss you, Gary Gygax. We all will. Goodbye, my\
  \ friend. </p> \n   <p>And thank you. </p> \n   <p>Erik Mona<br> Paizo Publisher</p>\
