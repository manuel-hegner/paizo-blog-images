  \    <p>It's November, and you all know what's special about this month, right?</p>\
  \ \n    <p>No, not turkey. (Though I guess eating an evolved dinosaur is pretty\
  \ cool, in a \"mammalian pride\" sort of way.)</p> \n    <p>No, not elections, either.\
  \ I mean, democracy's great and all, but let's get our priorities straight here,\
  \ people.</p> \n    <p>No, November's special because <b>this is the month when\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9gou\">the first issue of <em>Pathfinder: Hollow Mountain</em></a>\
  \ releases!</b></p> \n    <p>I'll give you a moment to catch your breath and clean\
  \ up the coffee mug you just dropped in your excitement. Ready? Okay.</p> \n   \
  \ <p itemprop=\"description\"><a href=\"/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics/hollowMountain\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder: Hollow Mountain</em></a> is the new comic series from Dynamite,\
  \ written by me, Wes Schneider, and Erik Mona. We're the same team who brought you\
  \ <a href=\"/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics/origins\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder: Origins</em></a>, but this time instead of doing six mostly independent\
  \ stories from the iconic team's past, we're hopping back to the present and taking\
  \ them on a brand new adventure.</p> \n    <p>But where to take them? When we got\
  \ the go-ahead to pitch a new series arc, we pretty quickly came up with two key\
  \ criteria. First, the series should involve a dungeon—given how central the idea\
  \ of a dungeon is to our game and to RPGs in general, it seemed like we were well\
  \ overdue for a true dungeon crawl. And second, we wanted to do something continuity-heavy—\
  something that a lot of fans of the game would recognize. After all, one of the\
  \ advantages of having three of Pathfinder's lead creators writing the scripts meant\
  \ that we could probably be trusted to play with some of the big toys. We wanted\
  \ a megadungeon that would be instantly recognizable to longtime players of the\
  \ game.</p> \n    <p>Immediately, our thoughts turned to Hollow Mountain. That giant\
  \ face on the side of a mountain had been taunting us since <a href=\"/products/btpy7zkr\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #1</em></a>. While we'd already published a high-level\
  \ overview of it in <a href=\"/products/btpy8lv5\"><em>Dungeons of Golarion</em></a>,\
  \ we'd never actually sent characters face-to-face with its horrors. Plus, the chance\
  \ to illustrate Runelords in the comics? Hell yes!</p> \n    <p>Yet as much fun\
  \ as it is to see some of our most notorious villains come to life in the pages\
  \ of issue #1, the biggest appeal for me was much more personal.</p> \n    <p>See,\
  \ back before <a href=\"/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics/hollowMountain\"\
  >the comic series</a> and the <a href=\"/pathfinder/legends\">Big Finish audio dramas</a>,\
  \ the only time we ever got to hear the iconics actually <i>talk</i> was in the\
  \ little chapter opener fiction snippets in the hardcover books. And with a handful\
  \ of exceptions, I've written every one of those for the last 6 years. (If you've\
  \ ever wondered why the characters seem to be constantly making fun of each other,\
  \ it's because I find it hilarious!) So after spending more than half a decade helping\
  \ to develop the iconics' personalities in 100-word bursts, it was a joy to finally\
  \ get to write scenes with the whole team, showing how they work together in combat,\
  \ express affection for each other (under that armor, Valeros is a big ol' softy)—\
  and, yes, make fun of each other at every possible opportunity.</p> \n    <p>Of\
  \ course, it's not just the main iconic team I'm excited to write. There are some\
  \ other very familiar faces you're going to be seeing over the course of this series.\
  \ But I'll let Wes talk about those next month...</p> \n    <p>See you all at the\
  \ comics shop!</p> \n    <p>James L. Sutter<br> <i>Executive Editor</i></p> \n \
