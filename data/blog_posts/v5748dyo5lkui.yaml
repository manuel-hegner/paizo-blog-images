  \ </div> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Rage consumes you in battle. You delight\
  \ in carving through your enemies using powerful weapons and wreaking havoc without\
  \ needing complicated techniques or rigid training, and you rely on your astonishing\
  \ durability to get you through a fight. You associate your rage with a traditional\
  \ symbol of affinity known as a totem, which might take the form of an animal, a\
  \ spirit, or even a part of yourself. To many barbarians, brute force is a hammer\
  \ and every problem looks like a nail; to others, the dark emotions within them\
  \ are something to hold back and release only when it matters most.</p> \n     <p>When\
  \ it came to barbarians in the playtest, we wanted to take the most popular parts\
  \ of the original barbarian and the unchained barbarian and brew them together with\
  \ a few special ingredients to make the class even more flexible to fit even more\
  \ roleplaying and mechanical concepts. Let's take a look!</p> \n     <h2>Rage</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>Rage is a barbarian's key class feature. Barbarians aren't super-trained\
  \ in fancy weapon techniques like most of the other martial classes. Instead, a\
  \ barbarian can enter a rage that drastically increases her damage and grants her\
  \ a significant booster shot of temporary Hit Points, in exchange for a –1 penalty\
  \ to AC and the inability to use concentrate actions unless they specifically have\
  \ the rage trait (note, this means that somatic-only spells are now possible in\
  \ a rage!). Unlike in Pathfinder First Edition, rage in the playtest is not limited\
  \ in rounds per day—let's be honest, in Pathfinder First Edition, our barbarians\
  \ never ran out of rounds anyway once they had gained a few levels. A rage lasts\
  \ 3 rounds, followed by a round of fatigue. While you're fatigued, you can't rage\
  \ again, but once that round has passed, you can enter a new rage, with a shiny\
  \ brand-new set of temporary Hit Points to go along with it. You can do this as\
  \ often as you need during the day!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb360\">\n      <a\

  ></a> \n      <p><i>Illustration by Wayne Reynolds</i></p>\n     </div> \n     <h2>Totems</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>Without a doubt, the most popular element of barbarians in Pathfinder\
  \ First Edition is the totem, introduced in the <a href=\"/products/btpy8fo1?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Players-Guide\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Advanced Player Guide</i></a>. These totems are\
  \ a set of three thematically linked abilities the barbarian can choose, starting\
  \ at 2nd level. In the playtest, you get a totem right away at 1st level. Your totem\
  \ is a representation of how and why you rage and grants you an initial ability,\
  \ access to more totem feats down the line, and, at 9th level, resistance equal\
  \ to your Constitution modifier against a specific type of damage. Each totem also\
  \ has its own anathema, most of which are relatively low impact and designed to\
  \ create roleplaying hooks. For instance, the giant totem's anathema states that\
  \ you cannot fail to accept a personal challenge of your strength, much like how\
  \ Amiri accepted the challenging task her tribal fellows set her to slay a frost\
  \ giant. Some though, are stricter—the superstition totem requires that you never\
  \ willingly accept the benefits of spells, but grants you some truly astounding\
  \ antimagic abilities in exchange.</p> \n     <p>Some of the totems, like animal\
  \ totem, giant totem, and dragon totem, offer a few abilities that are flat-out\
  \ magical. For instance, animal totem barbarians can adopt animal features and attacks\
  \ and even transform into an animal (a great way to represent lycanthrope characters),\
  \ whereas dragon totem barbarians gain a dragon breath attack can even grow wings.\
  \ Even though totems are popular and roleplaying opportunities are fun, we recognize\
  \ not everyone necessarily <i>wants</i> to commit to them, so we also offer the\
  \ fury totem, which has no anathema or special requirements and focuses more on\
  \ barbarian feats that aren't tied to any totem, which we'll look at in a bit. But\
  \ first...</p> \n     <h2>Additional Barbarian Features</h2> \n     <p>Though I\
  \ called out rage and totems specifically, the barbarian has some really neat abilities\
  \ beyond those. For instance, at level 3, barbarians gain critical specialization\
  \ effects when in a rage, even if they don't fulfill the usual proficiency rank\
  \ requirement for the weapon—they use whatever weapon is most efficient to express\
  \ their rage! One other thing they have that nobody else does: 12 Hit Points per\
  \ level. Add that to the substantial temporary Hit Points that they can generate\
  \ (possibly multiple times in a long fight) and the resistances from their totem\
  \ that kick in at level 9, and barbarians have incredible staying power. Sure, they\
  \ don't prevent as many hits as a paladin or a shield fighter might, but they can\
  \ stand there taking hits long past the point where anyone else could stay standing.\
  \ This is also a good point to mention one feature barbarians don't have in the\
  \ playtest: alignment requirements. Barbarians can be whatever alignment they want;\
  \ for instance, a lawful barbarian might act like one of the concepts I described\
  \ earlier, controlling and holding back her emotions to channel and release her\
  \ rage when it matters most.</p> \n     <p>As many of you have predicted, barbarians\
  \ also have the best Fortitude proficiency, gaining the juggernaut class feature\
  \ at level 7 (which grants master proficiency in Fortitude and the ability to count\
  \ any successes you roll as critical successes instead) and improved juggernaut\
  \ at 13th (which grants legendary proficiency and removes the chance of critically\
  \ failing), but they also have a secondary Will focus, gaining indomitable will\
  \ at 15th level to become masters in Will. Tireless rage comes in at level 17 to\
  \ allow barbarians to ignore fatigue after ending a rage (though they still must\
  \ wait the normal amount of time before entering a new rage). Barbarians are all\
  \ about brutalizing opponents without worrying about carrying lots of different\
  \ weapons and selecting the right one for the job with their monster knowledge,\
  \ so it makes sense that they gain the ability to rip through a chunk of resistances\
  \ automatically with level 19's devastating strikes ability. Possibly my favorite\
  \ barbarian feature, though, is the level 11 ability mighty rage—whenever you enter\
  \ a rage, it allows you to immediately use one of your rage-only actions for free.\
  \ So many possibilities!</p> \n     <h2>Barbarian Feats</h2> \n     <p>In addition\
  \ to the feats based on totems, there are a variety of other feats available, from\
  \ the bread-and-butter, low-level Sudden Charge to the devastating Whirlwind Strike\
  \ (attack everything in your reach), Brutal Critical (your critical hits deal an\
  \ extra die of damage as well as persistent bleed damage), Vicious Evisceration\
  \ (you maim the enemy, dealing extra damage, reducing its maximum HP by an amount\
  \ equal to its level, and giving it a –1 penalty to Fortitude), Contagious Rage\
  \ (one of your allies gets the benefits and –1 penalty to AC imposed by your rage,\
  \ but can still concentrate), and Quaking Stomp (you stomp so hard that it creates\
  \ an honest-to-goodness earthquake). But none caused a playtest GM to raise their\
  \ eyebrows quite like the superstition totem's Spell Sunder, which really saved\
  \ us when we faced <i>walls of force</i>, magical trap effects, and more.</p> \n\
  \     <p>To close off, some of you might have expected me to talk about the dragon\
  \ totem barbarian Linda is playing in my playtest game, who has sometimes been the\
  \ party's primary healer. She does that through abilities beyond the barbarian class,\
  \ though certainly Moment of Clarity (which allows a barbarian to use an extra action\
  \ to use a concentrate ability mid-rage). But if you're wondering why there was\
  \ a time in my playtest when she was the only one with an area attack, that was\
  \ because of her barbarian's dragon breath!</p> \n     <p>Mark Seifter<br> <i>Designer</i></p>\
