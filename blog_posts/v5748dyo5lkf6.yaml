  > \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">As January draws to a close, planning for our\
  \ big conventions starts in earnest. Volunteer solicitations for PaizoCon and Gen\
  \ Con went out, but that is the first step in a long list of tasks. Last week, the\
  \ Organized Play team met and made decisions as to what scenarios/events to offer\
  \ at each of the big conventions – PaizoCon, Origins, and Gen Con, as well as what\
  \ special events would be on offer at UKGE and PaizoCon UK. Now we need to get granular\
  \ and start looking at the daily schedules and numbers of tables.</p> \n    <p>Before\
  \ we jump into convention chat, the org play team wanted to take a minute and revisit\
  \ two other topics under discussion recently. The first is the Regional Support\
  \ Program and the second is the retirement of the Scarab Sages Faction.</p> \n \
  \   <h2>Regional Support Program</h2> \n    <p>Last year, we indicated the Regional\
  \ Support Program would run from 1 Feb 2017 to 31 Jan 2018, and that we would evaluate\
  \ it for renewal heading into Feb 2018. The program last year met our goals of getting\
  \ convention style benefits into GMs hands and promoting play in local stores and\
  \ communities. Thus we will continue it for the 2018/19 cycle. At this point, John,\
  \ Linda, and Thurston are putting the final touches on the new package and we hope\
  \ to have it available for download to Venture-Officers by the end of the month.\
  \ Qualifying events start 1 Feb. If you are unsure what is needed to run the program,\
  \ visit our policy page for more information.</p> \n    <p>We received feedback\
  \ from participating GMs who noted that not everyone completed their 2017/18 cards\
  \ and that they would appreciate a chance to get their rewards for running games\
  \ over the past year. The team discussed the issue and is extending the completion\
  \ deadline for 2017/18 cards. During the 2018/19 RSP season, a GM may choose to\
  \ check a box on their old card or their new card for every game run. Only one box\
  \ may be checked per game. This change only applies to completing cards. No 2017/18\
  \ cards may be issued after 31 Jan 2018.</p> \n    <h2>Scarab Sages</h2> \n    <p>Thank\
  \ you to all who posted feedback on the <a href=\"http://paizo.com/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lkbq?MidSeason-Faction-Updates\"\
  >December 13 blog </a>discussing mid-season faction changes. Taking this feedback\
  \ into consideration, the team decided to not retire the Scarab Sages, but rather\
  \ to make the faction inactive. All characters currently part of the Scarab Sages\
  \ may retain their membership in the faction. Mechanically, this allows current\
  \ faction members to accrue Prestige Points and Fame, buy vanities, and continue\
  \ to complete faction journal card goals. However, there will be no new faction\
  \ journal card produced for the faction in Season 10, and scenarios are unlikely\
  \ to provide ongoing stories focused on the faction. This blends the requests of\
  \ our player base with how the team sees the storylines progressing for the Society\
  \ as a whole.</p> \n    <p>This change also means that with the publication of an\
  \ updated Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild Guide in the coming weeks, characters\
  \ will no longer be able to join the Scarab Sages faction. If you would like to\
  \ change your character's faction from the Scarab Sages to any other faction, you\
  \ may do so at a cost of 0 Prestige Points. You should perform this change either\
  \ by August 2nd, 2018 or at the beginning of the next adventure the character plays,\
  \ whichever occurs last.</p> \n    <h2>Convention Chat</h2> \n    <p>With the other\
  \ topics covered, I now return to convention information. Planning conventions the\
  \ size of PaizoCon, Origins, and Gen Con, is nigh impossible without a team of leads\
  \ and an army of volunteer GMs and HQ staff. First, a huge thanks to everyone who\
  \ already volunteered for a 2018 event (or two or three). I’m starting to send out\
  \ PaizoCon volunteer acceptance letters and look to have them done by the first\
  \ of February. Gen Con letters are also in the pipeline and volunteers should see\
  \ them soon. We are currently putting the Origins volunteer plans together and will\
  \ publish that information asap.</p> \n    <p>Second, if you haven’t volunteered\
  \ and would like to, there is still time. PaizoCon is mostly full, but we usually\
  \ have a few cancellations before the event. Gen Con still has space, including\
  \ for 8-block volunteers qualifying for hotel rooms. To volunteer for PaizoCon,\
  \ complete <a href=\"https://goo.gl/forms/rBgkxMQ1DiFctj823\">this questionnaire</a>\
  \ For Gen Con, follow <a href=\"https://goo.gl/forms/pu9NztILpQD88ZKD2\">this link</a>\
  \ to the volunteer questionnaire.</p> \n    <p>One of the first tasks needing completion\
  \ involves assembling a leadership team for each convention, without which the planning\
  \ and running would be almost impossible. Below are the teams for each of the big\
  \ three Paizo sponsored events. They assist with almost every aspect of the convention,\
  \ from set up/tear down to schedule planning to on-site volunteer coordination.\
  \ If you are interested in working as a lead/department head for one of the Paizo-sponsored\
  \ conventions in 2019, speak to one of the people listed below and they can get\
  \ you involved this year to see what goes into planning these conventions.</p> \n\
