  \ October 4, 2010</p> \n   <p><a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lbef\">Last month</a>,\
  \ it was my privilege to help announce the first-ever <a href=\"http://www.pathfinderchronicler.net/?p=2046\"\
  \ target=\"nofollow\">Pathfinder Chronicler fanfiction contest</a>! In addition\
  \ to encouraging everyone who's ever been tempted to write some Pathfinder-based\
  \ fiction to enter the contest (or join up with the Pathfinder Chronicler and <i>Wayfinder</i>\
  \ folks, who're rocking the fanfiction year-round), I was also honored to be brought\
  \ in as the guest judge for the final round of the contest. After combing through\
  \ almost 70 submissions, the secret brain trust behind Pathfinder Chronicler and\
  \ <i>Wayfinder</i> presented me with the five stories that they'd chosen as the\
  \ best of the bunch and asked me to cast the deciding vote.</p> \n   <p>And you\
  \ know what? They were all a lot of fun. I knew our community had talent, but I\
  \ was really blown away by the quality of the submissions. Some were funny—the amorous\
  \ gnome who collects \"bad boy\" adventurers, or the famous adventurer-chef of Absalom—\
  while others were deadly serious. I had to sit down and give the issue serious thought,\
  \ but in the end, it was clear how the dice fell.</p> \n   <p><b>The Winner</b>:\
  \ Neil Spicer for \"Rain of Redemption,\" the story of an Abadarian priestess's\
  \ loss—and renewal—of faith. Plus ghouls. Lots of ghouls. Neil will receive a $100\
  \ paizo.com gift certificate, courtesy of the Pathfinder Chronicler folks, as well\
  \ as special publication in <i>Wayfinder</i> #4.</p> \n   <p><b>The Runners-Up</b>:\
  \ William Dodds for \"A Feast to Remember,\" a riotous romp through the seedy side\
  \ of Absalom's restaurant business, and Eric Morton for \"Unrequited,\" the aforementioned\
  \ story of Princess, a gnome who's eager to prove her unsolicited love for dashing\
  \ adventurers—by any means necessary. Both will receive $50 gift certificates to\
  \ paizo.com.</p> \n   <p><b>The Finalists</b>: Todd Stewart for \"Tea with the Laughing\
  \ Fiend,\" a classic, \"wake-up-in-Hell\"-style nightmare from the man who brought\
  \ you <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy87uz\">The Great Beyond</a>, and Maggie Hoyt for\
  \ \"Enchained,\" a story of the intricacies of genie binding and family politics.\
  \ All of the \"Final Five\" winners will be posted in perpetuity on the <a href=\"\
  http://www.pathfinderchronicler.net\" target=\"nofollow\">Pathfinder Chronicler</a>\
  \ website, along with many other fabulous submissions.</p> \n   <p><b>Special Mention</b>:\
  \ Last but not least, I'd like to throw out a special mention to Katherine Worley,\
  \ who at thirteen years old produced a truly impressive story of gods, curses, and\
  \ kobolds in the River Kingdoms. Though she didn't make it into the Final Five this\
  \ time around, I hope that she—and everyone who participated—is extremely proud,\
  \ and that you all keep writing.</p> \n   <p>Thanks to both the Chronicler and Wayfinder\
  \ folks, and here's to a thriving fanfiction community!</p> \n   <p>James Sutter\
