  \  </tr>\n    </tbody>\n   </table> \n   <p>Cave raptors are sated; it's time to\
  \ blog!</p> \n   <p>The holidays are an important time in every culture; they remind\
  \ us of the things that really matter in life and remind us why we stay far, far\
  \ away from our families most of the time. But aside from those core elements, every\
  \ culture celebrates its holidays differently. As Paizo's only practicing member\
  \ of the Reformed Church of Lamashtu, it falls upon me to explain Lamashtan holy\
  \ days. In the interest of spreading tolerance and understanding, it seems a good\
  \ idea to share that information with Paizo's fanbase as well.</p> \n   <p>A lot\
  \ of myths and slander float around about Reformed Lamashtans. Rumors about blood\
  \ sacrifice and stealing babies. Most of it is true, but we obsess far less over\
  \ boring ceremony than Orthodox Lamashtans. A few quick cuts, a muttered \"death\
  \ to all,\" and then we move on the dinner and drinking, and we haven't used real\
  \ baby since I was in junior high. Within the hour, Uncle Rax is drunk and telling\
  \ his old stories about the '70s and the kids are torturing the holiday halfling.\
  \ Good times, and not altogether different from the family celebrations of friends\
  \ I've visited.</p> \n   <p>This past weekend marked one of my favorite family holidays:\
  \ New Ears' Eve. One night a year, goblins gather together to celebrate the passage\
  \ of another 12 months in the traditional way: By comparing the ears they've collected\
  \ that year. Ear collecting, as you well know, goes back thousands of years. Young\
  \ goblins receive their first Heary-Thing Jar during their earmitzvah, which marks\
  \ a goblin's coming of age. Though the brine is changed out periodically, and few\
  \ gobbers can resist the lure of the occasional pickled hearing, the jar itself\
  \ is treasured and kept safe for a lifetime. Ears of victims, debtors, and civil\
  \ servants are collected as keepsakes of important events or remarkably gassy days,\
  \ then added to the preservative fluid. By the time New Ears' rolls around, most\
  \ of us can boast half a dozen or more new additions.</p> \n   <p>Traditionally,\
  \ the pecking order for the coming year is hashed out by comparing the number, size,\
  \ variety, and stories surrounding the most recent audial acquisitions. Orthodox\
  \ Lamashtans settle ties with the holiest of rituals: the drunken knife-fight. In\
  \ the Reformed Church, the family order is largely unaffected by collections, aside\
  \ from determining the favorite child for the year to come. New Ears' Eve instead\
  \ gives the family an excuse to get together, talk, and enjoy ear-based cuisine\
  \ (like grandma's cochleabread men and shepard's pinnea). Noisemakers are passed\
  \ around so everyone can be sure they have both ears. Festive hats are worn both\
  \ to gloat over the continued possession of both ears and because hats are the most\
  \ sacred of head coverings. As midnight approaches, we pick the juiciest trophies\
  \ from the winner's Jar, set them on fire, then let the delighted children throw\
  \ them around the room. The smell of burning earwax fills the home and reminds us\
  \ how lucky we are to still have a loving family. And our ears.</p> \n   <p>This\
  \ lovely tradition not only brings families closer together, but it associate a\
  \ sense of community and togetherness with an activity everyone loves anyway: cutting\
  \ off ears and stuffing them in a jar of cold, stagnant vinegar. To this day, whenever\
  \ I mutilate the body of an enemy or someone who has served me cold coffee, I can't\
  \ help but think of my loving family and smile.</p> \n   <p>So, from all of us here\
  \ at Paizo, to all of you out there in the Internet: Happy New Ears', and may your\
  \ Heary-Thing Jar never grow waxy!</p> \n   <p>Crystal Frasier <br>Production Specialist</p>\
