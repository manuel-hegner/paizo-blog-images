  \ Cometh!</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Friday, December 7, 2007</p> \n   <p>One of\
  \ the most innovative things I've seen in D&amp;D occurred back in the original\
  \ Ravenloft, where the villain's motivation, treasure placement, and adventure goals\
  \ depended upon the results of an in-game fortune-telling session. Even years later,\
  \ I still recall that feeling of surprise and excitement when I first looked through\
  \ that adventure. With Curse of the Crimson Throne, <i>Pathfinder</i>'s second Adventure\
  \ Path, we'll be trying something similar.</p> \n   <p>The Harrow deck is our fortune-telling\
  \ tool for this Adventure Path. The deck itself is a 54-card deck broken down into\
  \ six suits of nine cards each. While, in-game, these six suits and the card images\
  \ themselves are \"in character,\" it draws a lot of its inspiration from the mechanics\
  \ of the game as well. The deck's six suits each symbolize one of the six basic\
  \ attributes all characters are built around: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution,\
  \ Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. And in each of those six suits, we have nine\
  \ different cards for each of the nine alignments. Therefore, we have a chaotic\
  \ evil Wisdom card, a neutral good Strength card, a lawful neutral Dexterity card,\
  \ and so on. </p> \n   <p>Of course, the actual art on each of these cards hides\
  \ its genesis in the rules behind symbolism and metaphor, so you don't have to worry\
  \ about any weird self-aware metagame strangeness popping up (I doubt very much\
  \ you'd ever hear a Varisian say something like, \"that chaotic evil king has a\
  \ really low charisma!\"). The Harrow deck itself is an ancient divination tool\
  \ used by the Varisians to tell the future and divine fortunes. Think of it as an\
  \ RPG-version of the tarot deck. </p> \n   <p>Each of Curse of the Crimson Throne's\
  \ six adventures are also tied in theme to the six suits of the Harrow deck, and\
  \ as you play through this new Adventure Path, Harrow deck readings can provide\
  \ valuable insights, helpful bonuses, or even unexpected perils and dangers. You\
  \ can expect to see some recurring themes throughout the Adventure Path tied to\
  \ the Harrow deck, but we'll be going beyond that. Players will be able to select\
  \ a feat, \"Harrowed,\" that'll let them use draws from the deck to hopefully tip\
  \ fortune in their favor. Visit a rough-and-tumble bar down on the waterfront in\
  \ Korvosa and you'll be able to gamble away your treasure in a game of Towers, a\
  \ gambling game created by lowbrows and scoundrels using the Harrow deck (and designed\
  \ by industry veterans Jason Bulmahn, Mike Selinker, and Teeuwynn Woodruff). And\
  \ just as the infamous Deck of Many Things was inspired by the tarot deck, there\
  \ might be a powerful magic Harrow deck waiting to bring all matter of mayhem to\
  \ your group at some point in Curse of the Crimson Throne. </p> \n   <p>And the\
  \ best part? <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy80sv\">We're making a Harrow deck you can\
  \ use yourself</a>, whether as part of your campaign, in readings of your own, or\
  \ just as a fun fantasy-themed card game. Over the next several weeks, we'll be\
  \ showing off Kyle Hunter's artwork for the Harrow deck here on our blog. Keep an\
  \ eye out, and see if you can figure out which image goes with the chaotic evil\
  \ strength card versus the one that goes with the lawful good one! </p> \n   <p>James\
  \ Jacobs <br>Editor-in-Chief, <i>Pathfinder</i></p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div>\
