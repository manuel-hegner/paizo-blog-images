  \  <p>Alaeron and Skiver return in Tim Pratt's brand-new Pathfinder Tales novel\
  \ set against the backdrop of the Iron Gods Adventure Path—<a href=\"/products/btpy98i2\"\
  ><i>Reign of Stars</i></a>!</p> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">When the\
  \ leader of the ruthless Technic League calls in a favor, the mild-mannered alchemist\
  \ Alaeron has no choice but to face a life he thought he'd left behind long ago.\
  \ Accompanied by his only friend, a street-savvy thief named Skiver, Alaeron must\
  \ head north into Numeria, a land where brilliant and evil arcanists rule over the\
  \ local barbarian tribes with technology looted from a crashed spaceship. Can Alaeron\
  \ and Skiver survive long enough to unlock the secrets of the stars? Or will the\
  \ backstabbing scientists of the Technic League make Alaeron's curiosity his own\
  \ undoing?</span></p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <h2>Chapter One: Intangible Assassin</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>The perimeter alarms howled, and Alaeron—master of the alchemical arts,\
  \ student of the arcane, and hater of unexpected visitors—carefully capped the lead\
  \ flask hissing and bubbling on his worktable and wondered which trap would kill\
  \ the intruder. </p> \n     <p>The simple spike-and-pit traps in the back yard were\
  \ haphazardly covered with dead leaves and unconvincing bits of sod, and were meant\
  \ to be noticed—burglars who attempted to avoid those would almost inevitably step\
  \ on an ingeniously hidden catapult that would fling them back over the wall. In\
  \ theory, anyway. When Alaeron had tested the trap with pigs and goats, about ten\
  \ percent of the subjects had been thrown at an awkward angle and splattered <i>into</i>\
  \ the wall instead. But anyone who chose to ignore the spikes and quite realistic-looking\
  \ skulls and climbed over the wall anyway deserved whatever fate befell him.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>If unwelcome visitors managed to avoid the catapult, their approach\
  \ to the back entrance would take them through a field of reactive caltrops of Alaeron's\
  \ own invention. His friend and patron, Skiver, said they were basically just bear\
  \ traps with unnecessary barbs, but bear traps merely snapped shut; these would\
  \ bite down, and then start <i>chewing</i>, sinking in the barbs and pulling them\
  \ out again. They were a fine area denial weapon and he had high hopes of selling\
  \ them to the Andoren military if the generals ever got over their aversion to what\
  \ they termed \"gruesome violations of the honor of the battlefield.\" There were\
  \ less scrupulous governments who would be delighted with the weapons, but Alaeron\
  \ was enough of a patriot to refuse to sell anything that might be used against\
  \ his own people. Andoran was the greatest nation in the world, forward-thinking\
  \ and idealistic, even if its generals did make poor ordnance-purchasing decisions.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>Any intruders who made it past that threat—presumably by levitating—\
  would trigger a cloud of acid when they got within ten feet of the laboratory proper,\
  \ a spray deployed from nozzles hidden in the rather garish topless female statues\
  \ Skiver had installed on either side of the door in a misguided attempt at a housewarming\
  \ present. The acid was a new formula Alaeron was working on, a short-acting compound\
  \ that should serve to dissolve clothing and flesh and muscle and organs, but leave\
  \ the bones intact. Alaeron could always sell skeletons. He wasn't particularly\
  \ interested in anatomy or necromancy, but he corresponded with other researchers\
  \ who were. Intruders in heavy armor would probably <i>just</i> have their armor\
  \ and skin stripped away, leaving the organs exposed, which would be terribly messy,\
  \ but it was hard to imagine someone in full plate climbing over the wall and making\
  \ it through the other traps unscathed anyway.</p> \n     <p>Anyone making it past\
  \ <i>that</i>—some kind of acid-resistant golem, perhaps—would have to stand on\
  \ the steps, or touch the door, and needless to say, no visitor who wasn't expected\
  \ could possibly survive <i>that</i>. True, if someone made it that far Alaeron\
  \ would have to install a new exploding door, but he had heaps of those in storage,\
  \ as they'd proven strangely unpopular among the wealthy and security-conscious\
  \ Andorens he'd expected to buy them. Those would-be customers had insisted that\
  \ not <i>all</i> unexpected visitors deserved to be killed automatically, which\
  \ made no sense to Alaeron at all—how could you get any work done if you just let\
  \ anyone show up on your doorstep at any time with no consequences? Alaeron supposed\
  \ his measures were overkill if you were simply worried about door-to-door salesmen,\
  \ religious zealots, and those seeking alms for the poor, but surely he wasn't the\
  \ <i>only</i> person in the city of Almas who was regularly menaced by unannounced\
  \ and heavily armed would-be assassins?</p> \n     <p>Alaeron watched the softly\
  \ glowing crystal globes on the wall, which indicated the smooth operation of his\
  \ various defense mechanisms. They would turn red if they were triggered...but they\
  \ remained steadfastly green. Perhaps he should have installed some sort of mystic\
  \ eye or magic mirror to give him a view of what was going on out there—but watching\
  \ thieves, spies, and Technic League assassins die didn't particularly interest\
  \ him.</p> \n     <p>When he heard the knocking sound, he initially assumed it was\
  \ one of his more lively experiments trying to escape from a box. It was only when\
  \ a voice called, \"I bring a message from the north,\" that Alaeron realized it\
  \ was the sound of someone knocking at the inner door of his laboratory, which should\
  \ have been utterly unreachable. The knock itself was peculiar, though: more of\
  \ a rattling rat-a-tat than the usual thump of a fist. </p> \n     <p>Alaeron considered\
  \ the various bottles within arm's reach. There were extracts that, when consumed,\
  \ would give him superhuman, feral strength, and if he wanted a more direct approach,\
  \ there were bombs, and even acids—the latter mere reagents for other concoctions,\
  \ but they'd prove quite effective if flung at any exposed skin or mucous membranes.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>But if the visitor had made it through his outer defenses unscathed,\
  \ none of those were likely to do any good. Clearly something more formidable was\
  \ in order. Alaeron called, \"Just a moment!\" He lifted the weapon concealed beneath\
  \ the worktable, took aim, and twisted the knob. </p> \n     <p>This particular\
  \ weapon—he called it the Wave-Maker, because it transformed solid matter into an\
  \ equivalent volume of water, which always tended to make a splash—was looted from\
  \ the last Technic League assassin who'd tried to kill Alaeron. The would-be murderer\
  \ had reduced a portion of Alaeron's outer wall to liquefied mud with the weapon\
  \ before blundering right into a trap that released a tiny spurt of a compound made\
  \ from the glands of a blue dragon that instantly turned all the liquid in his body\
  \ into sand. The manner of his death, given the weapon he came armed with, was <i>almost</i>\
  \ ironic.</p> \n     <p>A shimmering beam shot from the rounded end of the Wave-Maker,\
  \ and the whole delicately curved and articulated weapon hummed with the usual minor\
  \ seventh chord. The inner door and a portion of the wall turned to water, showering\
  \ down into a messy puddle, and revealing the lean, tall, long-haired form of a\
  \ Kellid beyond. The northern barbarian's cold and watchful eyes looked at Alaeron\
  \ levelly, and despite walking directly through the path of the beam, the man was\
  \ not even remotely liquefied. </p> \n     <p>Alaeron winced and put the weapon\
  \ away. \"Incorporeal?\"</p> \n     <p>The Kellid nodded. </p> \n     <p>\"I remember\
  \ Gannix of the Technic League was experimenting with an artifact from Silver Mount\
  \ that rendered things incorporeal,\" Alaeron said. \"But his test subjects kept\
  \ falling straight down into the bowels of the earth. I suppose someone else took\
  \ up his researches after his death and managed to solve the practical problems.\
  \ Hmm. Clearly the effect is aura-based, since your clothing is also incorporeal.\
  \ Combined with a levitation effect to keep you on a level plane, I assume? That's\
  \ how I would have approached it.\"</p> \n     <p>\"I have not come to discuss my—\
  \"</p> \n     <p>\"Hmm. Did you make yourself solid again to knock on the door?\
  \ Seems like a dangerous gamble, since if you gave up incorporeality I could have\
  \ killed you in any number of ways through the door. But there was something funny\
  \ about that knock...\" Alaeron snapped his fingers. \"Wait, I know that sound—\
  you threw pebbles at the door, didn't you, like a suitor flinging stones at a lover's\
  \ window? So you can pick up stones, and they become incorporeal, and when they\
  \ leave your aura, they become solid again. How interesting. Not very sophisticated,\
  \ but elegant in its simplicity, I suppose.\"</p> \n     <p>\"You like to talk,\"\
  \ the assassin—for what else could he be?—said. \"You would do better to listen.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"And so I will, the moment I hear something interesting. I assume\
  \ you've come to kill the thief, the apostate, the runaway apprentice? Er, those\
  \ are all me, I mean. All three.\" Alaeron was sitting on a stool, and the stool\
  \ was on top of a trapdoor. With the right shift in pressure, he could trigger a\
  \ lever, drop through the trapdoor, and slide down a greased chute into a heavily\
  \ fortified safe room, which would be worthless against a person who could walk\
  \ through walls. Alaeron wondered how the Kellid would strike, given his incorporeality.\
  \ Throwing knives, perhaps, becoming solid when they left his aura? Perhaps a sling\
  \ or a slingshot? Even a crossbow. The possibilities were, if not endless, at least\
  \ numerous. </p> \n     <p>Alaeron had killed four League assassins in the past\
  \ year and a half—none as formidable as Kormak, the first of them, who'd pursued\
  \ Alaeron to far continents in his zeal. It would be a shame to die now, at the\
  \ hands of yet another servant of the League, even though, statistically, Alaeron\
  \ had always known his luck would run out and his planning prove insufficient someday.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>But, apparently, not today. \"I am not here to kill you,\" the Kellid\
  \ said. \"I am here to deliver a message, and a gift.\"</p> \n     <p>Alaeron grunted.\
  \ He had, briefly, served as an apprentice to the Technic League, a group of vile\
  \ arcanists who plundered the riches and relics of Numeria, where long ago a ship—\
  or a city, or something stranger—had fallen from the sky and crashed into the earth,\
  \ scattering its bizarre and powerful mysteries across the breadth of the land.\
  \ Alaeron, always fascinated by forbidden knowledge, had been unable to resist the\
  \ appeal of such a place, though the members of the League revolted him, as they\
  \ were slavers and tyrants who were only interested in power, not the deep secrets\
  \ of the universe. After certain misadventures in Numeria he'd escaped with a sack\
  \ full of relics...and ever since, the League had been trying to get its stolen\
  \ property back, and take revenge on him, too. In the process, the League had allowed\
  \ Alaeron to steal even <i>more</i> property from its failed assassins, which only\
  \ made its leaders want to kill him more. It was a vicious circle, though it also\
  \ served to enrich Alaeron, so it could have been worse.</p> \n     <p>\"Is this\
  \ message mostly in the form of curses and inventive profanity?\" Alaeron said.\
  \ \"And is the gift poisonous, or explosive, or both?\"</p> \n     <p>\"The nature\
  \ of the message has not been disclosed to me,\" the Kellid said. He reached into\
  \ his pack and then tossed a wooden box slightly larger than a human head toward\
  \ the lab table. When the box left his field of incorporeality, it became solid\
  \ and landed with a <i>thunk</i>. Alaeron sucked air through his teeth in dismay—\
  there were substances on the table that did not react well to being jostled—but\
  \ nothing blew up or bubbled over, so no harm done—this time. </p> \n     <p>\"\
  I am staying at the Succulent Eel, near the docks,\" the Kellid said. </p> \n  \
  \   <p>Alaeron blinked. The Eel was rather exclusive, in a very particular way.\
  \ \"Really?\"</p> \n     <p>The Kellid continued in a bored tone. \"I will be there\
  \ for the next two days, if you wish to send back a message.\" With that, he departed,\
  \ passing through a wall and out of sight.</p> \n     <p>Alaeron carefully examined\
  \ the box from all angles. It was made from an unfamiliar pale wood, with unsettling\
  \ patterns in the grain that made him think it had come from a tree twisted by magical\
  \ forces. The nails holding it together were shiny and uniform, the sort of precision\
  \ work he'd grown accustomed to seeing during his time with the Technic League.\
  \ He didn't see any indication that the box was trapped, but he wished briefly that\
  \ he'd hired an assistant at some point anyway—someone disposable to pry open the\
  \ box while Alaeron himself stood some discreet distance away, perhaps behind a\
  \ wall of stones and steel. </p> \n     <p>He swabbed the edges of the box with\
  \ certain substances that reacted to the presence of alchemical explosives, and\
  \ they turned up no sign of such dangers. After a moment's thought he went to another\
  \ worktable in the long, high-ceilinged laboratory and returned with an augur. He\
  \ drilled a coin-sized hole in one side of the box, then activated an alchemical\
  \ light-stick and peered inside by its illumination. How embarrassing it would be\
  \ to open the box and be attacked by some venomous mutated Numerian serpent. </p>\
  \ \n     <p>But as far as he could see through the hole, the box contained nothing\
  \ but a folded sheet of parchment resting atop a small object wrapped in cloth.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>There was such a thing as being too cautious, and in truth, Alaeron's\
  \ elaborate precautions were just an attempt to offset his natural tendency to leap\
  \ in without looking. You couldn't make bombs and mix acids and dismantle ancient\
  \ relics for a living if you were overly worried about preserving your own life,\
  \ limbs, and sanity. He'd crawled into many a barrow, burglarized many a library,\
  \ and mixed many an unknown substance just to see what would happen, and if he hadn't\
  \ grown a bit paranoid about the League's attempts to kill him, he'd likely still\
  \ be leading such a reckless life, trusting in his own quick thinking and reflexes\
  \ to keep him from coming to serious harm. </p> \n     <p>He'd rather hated traveling\
  \ the world and adventuring when he was in the midst of it, but now, sitting here\
  \ in his laboratory examining the treasures he'd won on those expeditions, he sometimes\
  \ missed the excitement. </p> \n     <p>Alaeron took a chisel and hammer and prised\
  \ off the top of the box. He lifted out the parchment, which was sealed with a blob\
  \ of wax marked with the impression of a cogwheel, the Technic League's symbol.\
  \ The wrapped parcel made him more curious—mysterious objects were, in a very real\
  \ sense, his reason to live—but it was probably better to see what the letter had\
  \ to say first.</p> \n     <p>He read it, stared at the wrapped parcel, read the\
  \ letter again, then folded it carefully and put the lid back on the box. After\
  \ that he descended through the laboratory's cellar, opened a panel in a false wall,\
  \ deactivated the traps ahead by pressing the proper stones in the wall in the proper\
  \ sequence, continued along a subterranean tunnel, reset the traps by pulling a\
  \ concealed lever, and emerged through a similar hidden door into the basement of\
  \ an empty house he owned some blocks away from his laboratory. From there he went\
  \ out into the street, found one of the loitering street children who could be trusted\
  \ to perform simple tasks for small coins, and sent the boy with a message to Alaeron's\
  \ friend Skiver.</p> \n     <p>The message was simple: \"Come quickly. I've just\
  \ received a letter from a dead woman.\"</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p><b>Coming\
