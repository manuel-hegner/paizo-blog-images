  >\n    At PaizoCon 2017, <a href=\"http://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/rpg\">Pathfinder\
  \ Society Roleplaying Guild</a> launched a new form of multi-table interactive special\
  \ (usually shortened to just “a Special”). In doing so, we changed up two big assumptions\
  \ from past Specials. First, other Specials traditionally kicked off a new season\
  \ and included integral plot developments that really incentivized playing that\
  \ Special as soon as possible. Second, those Specials were each built to be self-contained,\
  \ to portray snapshot events that never evolved, and needed to be built from the\
  \ ground up each time. As we explored new ways to provide Specials to more conventions—\
  particularly to those taking place between January and May, by which point many\
  \ people have already played the big Special that debuted at Gen Con the previous\
  \ year—we developed <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9s15?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-899A-The-Solstice-Scar-Version-A\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Society Special #8–99: The Solstice Scar</i></a>, a modular Special\
  \ comprised of numerous 90-minute-long parts that can be swapped out over time to\
  \ tell an evolving story.\n    <p></p> \n    <h2>How does “The Solstice Scar” work?</h2>\
  \ \n    <p><a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9s15?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-899A-The-Solstice-Scar-Version-A\"\
  ><i>The Solstice Scar</i></a> consists of three 90-minute chapters, called <b>parts</b>,\
  \ and each time we swap out an older part and add a newer one, we release a new\
  \ <b>version</b> of the adventure. At PaizoCon 2017, we released Version A (aka\
  \ #8–99A), which consisted of Parts 1, 2, and 3. About a month ago we sent out Version\
  \ B, which consists of Parts 1, 3, and 4. Each new version's repeats that process,\
  \ removing one older part and adding on a new part. That means that if you play\
  \ all versions of <i>The Solstice Scar</i>, you'll experience some parts several\
  \ times while also experiencing new content.</p> \n    <p><b>“Season Agnostic”:</b>\
  \ One of the key design goals was to create a story that could stand on its own.\
  \ <i>The Solstice Scar</i> does not interact directly with any of the season storylines,\
  \ instead telling its own epic narrative. </p> \n    <p><b>Replay:</b> Playing <i>The\
  \ Solstice Scar</i> multiple times does suggest that someone can play it multiple\
  \ times, right? That's right, specifically each version of this Special is considered\
  \ a separate adventure for the purpose of reporting. That means you can earn credit\
  \ once as a player and as a GM each time we release a new version. What's more,\
  \ that also means that the same character can play and earn credit for each version;\
  \ there's even a boon with a niche cumulative award.</p> \n    <p><b>Restrictions:</b>\
  \ This Special is playable in any venue that can field the minimum 3 tables. That\
  \ makes it an excellent fit for everything from large conventions to smaller local\
  \ events.</p> \n    <p><b>Retirement:</b> Each version of <i>The Solstice Scar</i>\
  \ is only playable for a limited time (approximately 6 months). Once a new version\
  \ of the adventure's released to the public, the previous version is retired from\
  \ play. There is a possibility that we'll release a combined 6-part version after\
  \ Part D is out in the wild for a while.</p> \n    <p><b>Exclusivity Windows:</b>\
  \ Each version has approximately a 6-month life cycle. When a new version is first\
  \ ready, it's available only to spotlight events for a window of about 1–2 months;\
  \ you won't be able to buy it during this time, and during this period, people can\
  \ play both that version and the previous version. After that, the new version's\
  \ available to the public and playable for another 4–5 months. I've provided more\
  \ exact dates in the Timeline section below.</p> \n    <p><b>Access:</b> If your\
  \ event would benefit from running <i>The Solstice Scar</i>, particularly during\
  \ the summer exclusivity window for Version C and the January exclusivity window\
  \ for Version D, contact your Regional Venture Coordinator.</p> \n    <p><b>Authors:</b>\
  \ This modular structure also allows us to bring in several authors over the course\
  \ of the storyline. Andrew Hoskins wrote Parts 1–4 when we first outlined the story,\
  \ and Kalervo Oikarinen is concluding the narrative with Parts 5 and 6.</p> \n \
  \   <p><b>Versions:</b> There are four versions of <i>The Solstice Scar</i> scheduled.</p>\
  \ \n    <ul> \n     <li>Version A (Parts 1, 2, and 3)</li> \n     <li>Version B\
  \ (Parts 1, 3, and 4)</li> \n     <li>Version C (Parts 3, 4, and 5)</li> \n    \
  \ <li>Version D (Parts 4, 5, and 6)</li> \n    </ul> \n    <h2>Timeline</h2> \n\
  \    <p>Here's how the dates break down for <i>The Solstice Scar</i>. The exclusivity\
  \ window for Version D includes some approximate dates that we'll be locking in\
  \ over time.</p> \n    <p><b>May 28, 2017:</b> Version A launched at PaizoCon, beginning\
  \ the exclusivity window.</p> \n    <p><b>August 4, 2017:</b> Version A featured\
  \ at Gen Con, after which the exclusivity window ended. The Special became available\
  \ for any qualifying events.</p> \n    <p><b>January 12, 2018:</b> Version B features\
  \ at numerous conventions worldwide, beginning the exclusivity window. During this\
  \ time, Version A is still playable at all venues.</p> \n    <p><b>February 21,\
  \ 2018:</b> The exclusivity window for Version B ends. Version A is retired.</p>\
  \ \n    <p><b>May 27, 2018:</b> Version C launches at PaizoCon, beginning its exclusivity\
  \ window. During this time, Version B is still playable at all venues.</p> \n  \
  \  <p><b>August 6, 2018:</b> Version C features at Gen Con, after which the exclusivity\
  \ window ends. Version B is retired.</p> \n    <p><b>January XXXX, 2019:</b> Version\
  \ D features at numerous conventions worldwide, beginning the exclusivity window.\
  \ During this time, Version C is still playable at all venues.</p> \n    <p><b>February\
  \ XXXX, 2019:</b> The exclusivity window for Version D ends. Version C is retired.</p>\
