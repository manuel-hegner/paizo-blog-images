  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">As the November chills make\
  \ their presence known, this month’s Starfinder Society releases promise players\
  \ some unique vistas to visit. If you’re in an area of the world like me, where\
  \ the snow is already piling up, tabletop RPGs can offer the perfect escape from\
  \ the cold reality outside. Luckily for us, this month’s Starfinder Society releases\
  \ take players to some previously unexplored regions of the known galaxy!</p> \n\
  \     <p><a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq021wi?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-211-Descent-into-Verdant-Shadow\"\
  >Starfinder Society #2-11: Descent into Verdant Shadow</a> is a Tier 3–6 scenario\
  \ that comes from the pen (errr, keyboard) of veteran freelancer, Larry Wilhelm.\
  \ For players who’ve been involved in Paizo Organized Play, Larry’s name should\
  \ come as no surprise, as his bibliography of scenarios is too long to list in a\
  \ single blog post. In Descent into Verdant Shadow, Larry weaves an adventure that\
  \ takes the PCs down into the depths of an Aballonian Ice Well—a jungle carved under\
  \ the planet’s surface by ancient meteor impacts. Down in the depths of this frozen\
  \ verdant landscape, the PCs discover an unexpected complication and must hurry\
  \ to avert a catastrophe that could affect the entire region. As with most of his\
  \ scenarios, Larry also provides some exceptional maps to go along with a fun stand-alone\
  \ adventure that may prove to have some importance in future scenarios!</p> \n \
  \    <p>Look at this plant-creature who’s going to help our PCs in their journey!</p>\

  \ \n     </div> \n     <p>Did you know that I like collecting things? I play a lot\
  \ of miniature wargames, so I collect those. I enjoy computer games where loot drops\
  \ and I get to collect all of that. One special “collection” I’ve worked to complete\
  \ over the years has been an attempt at getting as many members of the Starfinder\
  \ team to write Organized Play scenarios as possible. Of the current team, I’m only\
  \ missing two*. <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq021wj?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-212-Colossus-Heist\"\
  ><i>Starfinder Society #2-12: Colossus Heist</i></a>** brings that count down to\
  \ one missing staff member as Paizo’s own, Amanda Hamon, giddily (and with some\
  \ story-related bribery) agreed to tackle Starfinder’s first adventure to the colossus-infested\
  \ world of Daimalko! Since Amanda created Daimalko and did the writing to flesh\
  \ it out in our upcoming <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01zud/discuss?Starfinder-RPG-Near-Space\"\
  >Starfinder Near Space</a> book, she was the perfect candidate to write a high-level\
  \ scenario that takes our players right into conflict with the dreaded colossi of\
  \ that world! No spoilers here; you need to play this scenario to believe I ever\
  \ got the premise into print!</p> \n     <p>Much like our first scenario in November,\
  \ our trek through Daimalko is going to involve the PCs getting to know a certain\
  \ NPC. Let me assure you, this damai understands the purity of unarmed combat!</p>\

  ></a> \n     </div> \n     <p>One other point I’d like to highlight for this month’\
  s releases, is the help of Jenny Jarzabski! You may know Jenny from her work on\
  \ <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy9x0w?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-107-The-Solar-Sortie\"\
  >Starfinder Society #1-07: The Solar Sortie</a> and <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01zn3?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-201-Pact-World-Warriors\"\
  >Starfinder Society #2-01: Pact World Warriors</a> or her time on the Pungeon Crawl\
  \ Starfinder stream. With the recent personnel shuffle, our team was down a developer,\
  \ and we looked for some extra assistance. Jenny stepped in and took on some freelance\
  \ development work for us. She was responsible for a lot of the development work\
  \ on <i>Descent into Verdant Shadow</i>. Jenny’s help ensured we could stay on top\
  \ of other duties, like the approaching Additional Resources update and the addition\
  \ of pregenerated characters for the new <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq0206c?Starfinder-Character-Operations-Manual\"\
  >Starfinder Character Operations Manual</a> classes. So, I wanted to take this opportunity\
  \ to thank Jenny for her work on one of this month’s scenarios and her upcoming\
  \ development work on one of December’s scenarios!</p> \n     <p>That brings us\
  \ to the end of the November previews. Check back in tomorrow for a peek at what\
  \ is to come with Pathfinder Society in November. Or if space is your cup of tea,\
  \ come back next month when we venture to the mysterious world of Wealdriad and\
  \ then into the very depths of the Lorespire Complex for our first Tier 9–12 scenario!</p>\
  \ \n    </blockquote> \n    <p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">Until next time,<br><b>Thurston\
  \ Hillman<br><i>Starfinder Society Developer</i></b></p> \n    <p>*Hey Rob McCreary,\
  \ when are you going to write a scenario for me?<br>**Fun side note: the original\
  \ title for this scenario was “Kaiju-Heist” before Rob (write a scenario for me)\
  \ McCreary reminded me that the Daimalko creatures were known as colossi.</p> \n\
