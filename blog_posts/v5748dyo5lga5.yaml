  >Before we get rolling into the main subject of this week's blog, we'd like to give\
  \ a big thanks to everyone who came to PaizoCon—especially everyone who participated\
  \ in Pathfinder Society Organized Play (understandably, we're a bit biased). We\
  \ got lots of really positive and helpful feedback following the test run of <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy97n3\"><i>Legacy of the Stonelords</i></a>, one of the upcoming\
  \ Specials set to run at Gen Con Indy 2014. There were also two lottery events called\
  \ \"Out of Retirement,\" in which Mark Moreland and John Compton revisited two of\
  \ Season 0's retired scenarios, redid the stat blocks (and redeveloped a few other\
  \ features), and ran them for credit for excited players. Rumor has it that Mark's\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy860d\"><i>Blood at Dralkard Manor</i></a> claimed a few\
  \ lives, whereas John's <a href=\"/products/btpy88sz\"><i>Hands of the Muted God</i></a>\
  \ proved less deadly but equally fun. You won't hear us promising to un-retire these\
  \ for the public just yet, but the positive response we got this makes it likely\
  \ we'll do something similar for the next PaizoCon. Thanks again!</span></p> \n\
  \    <p><a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lg6r\">A month ago</a>, we briefly discussed\
  \ the impact of faction PCs' decisions in the campaign and how these decisions have\
  \ shaped the direction that these factions are going. The following week on the\
  \ <a href=\"http://35privatesanctuary.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;id=35&amp;Itemid=34\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Know Direction podcast</a>, John Compton expanded on what this\
  \ evolution might entail for many factions: name changes, shifting goals, and even\
  \ changes in leadership. Recently, we revealed the changes coming up for <a href=\"\
  /paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lg87\">Andoran and Cheliax</a>, and <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lg8v\"\
  >Osirion and Taldor</a>.</p> \n    <p>As advertised over a year ago, the so-called\
  \ nation-based factions have spent the past season (or longer for some like the\
  \ Cheliax faction) distancing themselves from their parent countries to embrace\
  \ less territorial and more broadly philosophical endeavors. When the Pathfinder\
  \ Society Organized Play leaders began discussing how factions would change, we\
  \ looked at the reporting numbers contributed by players worldwide and carefully\
  \ considered how the faction might change to reflect this information while still\
  \ appealing to a large percentage of its members. For example, members of the Silver\
  \ Crusade faction tend to be good guys, so changing that faction to be neutrally\
  \ aligned would discourage a lot of players.</p> \n    <p>Today's factions both\
  \ love their money, though in the past they've pursued this goal in slightly different\
  \ ways. Be warned that there are some light spoilers from Season 5 scenarios referenced\
  \ below.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderChronicles/PZO9208-Katapesh.jpg\"\

  \ Pathfinder Missions as a Front for Personal Gain</h2> \n    <p>Guaril Karela's\
  \ takeover of the Sczarni families seemed nothing short of flawless, and within\
  \ a year, he controlled most of the Sczarni operations in Varisia. In doing so,\
  \ he and his agents had stepped on quite a few toes, earning them the enmity of\
  \ the \"survivors.\" For the past year these survivors have orchestrated Guaril's\
  \ downfall—preferably executed with a sharp knife in a dark alley. Fortunately for\
  \ Guaril, he had also worked his way into the Pathfinder Society's good graces and\
  \ established himself as an indispensible spymaster, and the Society devoted some\
  \ of its resources to keeping the canny Varisian out his enemies' sights.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Guaril is tired of lying low, and now that his agents have tracked down\
  \ and dispatched a few of the rogue Sczarnis' ringleaders, he is ready to deliver\
  \ the killing blow and be rid of this threat forever. Of course, his enemies won't\
  \ go down without a fight, so Sczarni faction PCs should expect <a href=\"/products/btpy97n4\"\
  ><i>a deadly showdown</i></a>. Should Guaril die, his nascent empire could crumble\
  \ without his threats and arm-twisting to keep things together. Even if he should\
  \ live, he has demonstrated weakness in the eyes of several key supporters, and\
  \ it may prove too much for the faction to recover.</p> \n    <h2>Qadira: Dominance\
  \ Through Trade</h2> \n    <p>Aaqir al'Hakam stepped up to guide the Qadira faction\
  \ after its then leader Pasha Mualia al'Jakri disappeared under violently ominous\
  \ circumstances, and for several years he has extended the faction's influence and\
  \ commercial interests in distant ports. Of all of the faction leaders we've discussed\
  \ thus far, al'Hakam has perhaps the least antagonistic relationship with his home\
  \ country. It's not that his superiors have betrayed, disowned, or disappointed\
  \ him. Rather, he has found that some of the more promising opportunities are available\
  \ only to those without a national affiliation.</p> \n    <p>Two years ago, the\
  \ Qadira faction undertook an ambitious project to claim markets in Varisia and\
  \ establish trade relations with Janderhoff. Although agents succeeded in some regards,\
  \ a wide variety of factors—including the existence of other aggressively mercantile\
  \ operations like those maintained by some of the Sczarni—stymied their progress.\
  \ It also seemed that the local people perceived the ambitious, foreign merchants\
  \ as invaders rather than as well-intentioned entrepreneurs. After months of hard\
  \ work, Aaqir al'Hakam redirected his resources elsewhere, admitting that the circumstances\
  \ were not yet right for his organization to supply Varisian demands.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>During the Year of the Demon, Qadira faction agents have developed trade contacts\
  \ far and wide in the Inner Sea region, building upon their past successes in the\
  \ years before. Markets in the Five Kings Mountains, Druma, Rahadoum, Kaer Maga,\
  \ Taldor, and Andoran have all shown an interest in the faction's services, and\
  \ their cooperation has only improved the more that al'Hakam portrays his operation\
  \ as an independent outfit and less as a state-sanctioned business. The significance\
  \ of this is not lost on the faction leader, and he has quietly laid the groundwork\
  \ for a new business with the blessing and support of his late mentor, the trade\
  \ princess Zarmina Bahjari.</p> \n    <p>Qadira is now aware of Aaqir al'Hakam's\
  \ plans, and for the most part the satrapy has accepted his new strategy with grace—\
  even though he is severing some of his ties to the nation. Most trade princes operate\
  \ independently, yet their successes nonetheless fill Qadira's coffers by encouraging\
  \ more trade to gravitate to Kelish ports; al'Hakam's venture is similar in many\
  \ ways but on a larger scale, and the ruling elite believe it is a better investment\
  \ to formally accept the faction's transformation, make the most of past accomplishments,\
  \ and enjoy the fruits of having the faction leader as an ally rather than as a\
  \ proxy.</p> \n    <p>What's more, it allows the one-time Qadira faction to merge\
  \ with like-minded operations that might otherwise balk at heavy-handed Kelish affiliation.\
  \ As you may have guessed by now, two of the factions are merging into one.</p>\
  \ \n    <h2>The Exchange: There are Two Sides to Every Coin</h2> \n    <p>In many\
  \ ways the new faction is going about business as usual, though it no longer operates\
  \ as an extension of the Qadiran state. PCs from Qadira (including those interested\
  \ in forwarding national interests) will still find the faction an attractive choice,\
  \ but by stepping away from its parent country, the faction also broadens its scope\
  \ and the types of stories we can tell. Flavor-wise, faction PCs will be more like\
  \ business partners and less like agents, and we anticipate missions, boons, vanities,\
  \ and faction traits will reflect this.</p> \n    <p>As for the Sczarni faction,\
  \ Aaqir al'Hakam has an eye for talent and believes the Sczarni network is too valuable\
  \ to dissolve as a result of Guaril Karela's recent troubles. Instead, the Sczarni\
  \ would benefit from being a part of al'Hakam's new endeavor, and in doing so his\
  \ business would expand beyond the mundane delivery of goods and into the realm\
  \ of more…\"challenging\" commodities. When the time is right, the trade prince\
  \ trusts Guaril will approve the merger.</p> \n    <p>And just in case your character\
  \ is an upstanding merchant that would frown upon the underhanded tactics used by\
  \ the Sczarni, we have some exciting ideas as to how to keep this combined \"money\"\
  \ faction appealing to both you and the less virtuous entrepreneur.</p> \n    <p>Happy\
