  \ every now and then, someone makes a typo and realizes that they’ve accidentally\
  \ created a pun or joke so bad that they must immediately drop it into their team’\
  s work chat, triggering a wave of snickering when we were in office, and now a wave\
  \ of reaction gifs via the office chat. We’ve even statted them up for <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh63?Foolish-Monsters-In-April\">previous\
  \ April Fools’ Day posts.</a></p>\n      <p>It’s been so fun that I’ve started stashing\
  \ <em>anything</em> I’ve deemed April Fools–worthy, to the point where if someone\
  \ else deems it worthy of The List, I’m summoned to add it immediately. Around a\
  \ month ago, I added to the goblins’ ever-full dance cards by releasing The List\
  \ into the wilds of the Paizo Chat. So with a year’s worth of out-of-context inspiration,\
  \ the goblins responded to me with this year’s foolish wonders!</p>\n      <p style=\"\

  \ Content Manager</em><br></p>\n      <h3>Wordsmith</h3>\n      <p>With every strike\
  \ of a wordsmith’s hammer, a new onomatopoeia is formed. They swiftly grab the word\
  \ as it flies off the anvil before nailing it to the pages of our favorite comics.\
  \ <em>POW! WHAM! SPLAT!</em> The hammer crafts each and every sound. The humble\
  \ wordsmith is often overlooked by their artisan peers, whose pictures are the primary\
  \ focus of readers. However, many don’t realize that while pictures can be sent\
  \ to the printing press, sounds are not captured so easily on the page and must\
  \ be hammered into place by a skilled wordsmith.</p>\n      <p>While most wordsmiths\
  \ are content to forge their words out of sight of the public, they are fierce defenders\
  \ of their work and are quick to fight anyone who belittles it. They know the pen\
  \ is mightier than the sword, but the hammer is mightiest of all, and they use it\
  \ mercilessly to <em>SMASH!</em> through their foes.</p>\n      <p>Though many wordsmiths\
  \ are dwarves, they come from all kinds of backgrounds, each bringing their own\
  \ unique sounds and noises from their culture. Tengu wordsmiths particularly favor\
  \ onomatopoeias similar to bird calls like <em>caw</em>for crows or <em>okalee</em>\
  \ for red-winged blackbirds. Meanwhile, leshy wordsmiths favor sounds inaudible\
  \ to most non-plant creatures, such as the <em>tr-tr-tr</em> that reflects the sound\
  \ of a plant growing.</p>\n      <p><b>Wordsmith Creature — 4</b></p>\n      <p><strong>Medium,\

  \         If this letter comes across my desk one more time, I’ll be reporting you\
  \ to Lictor Stought. I understand the fear one carries when confronted with the\
  \ possibility of hags, but I can reassure you that the <em>Bloddey Glass Hag</em>\
  \ is not one to fear because she <em>does not exist</em>.</p>\n       <p>“You are\
  \ now cursed!! You must copy this letter and send it on or you will be killed!!!\
  \ In a fortnight at twilight the Bloddey Glass Hag will crawl out from under your\
  \ mattress! This isn’t a joke! She will stab your chest and pull out your eyeballs\
  \ with a fork and if you don’t have eyeballs she will pull out your liver and if\
  \ you don’t have a liver she will pull off your skin and use it to make a newe dress!\
  \ And then she’ll take your corpse and she’ll stuff it under your bed or she’ll\
  \ put you in the closet! What will your Maralictor tell your family??? It won’t\
  \ be funny then! Send this letter to ten other Hellknights to break the curse! Remember,\
  \ the Bloddey Glass Hag is watching you sleep!!!”</p>\n       <p>This is ridiculous,\
  \ armiger.</p>\n       <p>I’ve sent copies of this to my fellow Paralictors, the\

  \ my youngest child at the Viridian Crystal, and we had the most wonderful little\
  \ cakes. I asked the chef’s familiar if we might have the recipe and the little\
  \ jay twittered and said that while he couldn’t give away the lady’s recipe, I would\
  \ be able to purchase it. Of course, being quite sensible I requested the price\
  \ and was told ‘two pieces.’ This seemed very reasonable, so I accepted, and I was\
  \ told it would be added to my bill.</p>\n       <p>The next day, I was going through\
  \ my letters and found my bill from the Crystal, and I was being charged two platinum,\
  \ 32 silver. Of course, 20 silver for dinner, 12 silver for the lovely crystal tiara\
  \ I purchased for my child, but apparently the two platinum were for the recipe\
  \ for the little cakes! Well, I threatened to take this up with the Edasseril family,\
  \ only to be told that I could put the recipe wherever I wanted, so here I am. I’\
  m sharing this recipe with everyone I know and hoping that they’ll send it to everyone\
