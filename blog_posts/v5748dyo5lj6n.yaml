  \ \n    <p itemprop=\"description\"> </p>\n    <p>The land shifted from soft sand\
  \ dunes to rocky hills that battered the feet of the caravaneers. With rhythmic\
  \ plodding punctuated by errant grunts, the camels trudged at a lumbering pace and\
  \ did not seem affected by the terrain. Though the morning breeze still held a breath\
  \ of cool night air that kissed their necks, the cicadas danced in anticipation\
  \ of the climbing sun.</p> \n    <p>Waving grasses sprung like soft hair from the\
  \ verdant earth as the road descended toward the river. It would be hours yet before\
  \ the weary travelers could rest, sponge away days of dried sweat, and luxuriate\
  \ into silk cushions at the Tooth &amp; Hookah. But now they could see the Half-City\
  \ before them, darkly nestled between the legs of the Crook and Asp rivers. Morning\
  \ light glistened through the linen-draped towers of the Sunburst Market, a brilliant\
  \ sunrise of color, promising secrets behind the rainbow shadows cast. And carried\
  \ on the wind, the chimes of the Pharasmin temple, luring treasure hunters to consign\
  \ their fates to the lottery.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\

  \ lazily swayed through the courtyard filled with an impatient throng. Travelers\
  \ from every corner of Golarion jostled and joked in a dozen languages, stealing\
  \ glances toward the yet-closed temple doors. Some were sun-touched and rough, apparent\
  \ rogues and mercenaries experienced in the art of Osirion tomb-raiding.</p> \n\

  \ woman—presumably a local by the fact she carried nothing but her heavy staff—\
  seemed to be searching the crowd, seeking the fate-spark of companionship.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Her gaze landed on an unlikely target, a heavy man laden with a curiosity\
  \ shop's worth of goods, his beard black as onyx. Their eyes met across the courtyard\
  \ and, with a pounding of her staff, the sea of miscreants briefly parted, naturally,\
  \ as if the perfect moment had been plucked from time. The conversation that followed\
  \ was hushed, for the weight of the stories they carried was heavy and not easily\
  \ shared. Mavaro, his name rolling with mystery of far-off places, made bold claims,\
  \ but made them quietly. He promised her that he could do anything, given the right\
  \ tools. This was the treasure he sought: not gold nor fame, but a wealth of memory.</p>\

  \ \n    <p>He seemed so unlike her. Perhaps that is why she felt so intrigued, and\
  \ caught herself licking her lips at his words. As his accoutrements were a jumble\
  \ of worn hand-me-downs and stolen grave goods, deciphering the man beneath would\
  \ be a challenge. \"I can be anything you need—whatever you want me to be,\" he\
  \ divulged with a low voice.</p> \n    <p>To demonstrate, he delicately untied a\
  \ rusted khopesh strapped to his side. With a featherweight grace, he swung the\
  \ blade, the bright steel edge glimmering with blue frost. \"May I?\" he gestured\
  \ toward her elaborately-carved staff. His fingers brushed hers as he grasped it\
  \ and the chill of the khopesh jolted up her spine. The sensation rushed upon her\
  \ as if she were the sword itself, wrapped in a frigid enchantment. He glanced down\
  \ and mumbled an apology.</p> \n    <p>As he held the staff, Mavaro's demeanor shifted,\
  \ became aggressive. Waves of arcane power hummed from the staff as the world around\
  \ them became somehow pliant to his whim. \"Is it only weapons?\" she chided. \"\
  A person can wield only so many.\" In answer, he returned her staff and pulled a\
  \ scroll from a bag she hadn't noticed before beneath his coat. As the icon of Thoth\
  \ unfurled, the uncertainty and fidgeting fell from his posture. His eyes grew old\
  \ and cold with lifetimes of knowledge. Ahmotep could see the judgement of the dead\
  \ upon his face. It reminded her of the Pharasmins.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \    <p>As if called, the crowd fell silent and pressed close as the temple doors\
  \ swung open, heavy with sculpted reliefs of birth and death in honor of Pharasma.\
  \ The black-robed Pharasmin clerics poured out in two lines, followed by a large,\
  \ simply decorated urn. The head priestess's face was a mask as she called out in\
  \ a bell-like voice, \"Attention. The first lottery begins now. Once all names are\
  \ drawn, the gates to the necropolis will be opened.\" She paused for effect. \"\
  Heed well the laws, and remember how this came to pass.\"</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  \   <p>The adventurers had found each other, and Ahmotep sensed soon there might\

  \ pull fate in her direction.</p> \n    <p>Liz Spain<br> <i>Adventure Card Game\
