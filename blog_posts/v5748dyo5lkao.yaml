  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Wednesday, November 29, 2017</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"\
  articlebody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Phew! I always think of the months\
  \ leading up to PaizoCon and Gen Con as the busiest time of the year, and while\
  \ that's true, it often downplays the holiday season's tight schedule to get all\
  \ of the scenarios ready a little earlier so that our colleagues can head off for\
  \ some well-deserved rest at the end of the year. That doesn't mean you're off the\
  \ hook, either—remember that you should be voting (and encouraging your friends\
  \ to vote) in the ongoing <a href=\"http://paizo.com/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lk9d?Leaders-in-Liberty-2\"\
  >Leaders in Liberty event</a> to help direct the Liberty's Edge faction. After that,\
  \ we have two great new scenarios for you to enjoy.</p> \n    <p>The first is <a\
  \ href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9x0s?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-908-Birthright-Betrayed\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Society Scenario #9–08: Birthright Betrayed</i></a>, a Tier 1–5 scenario\
  \ by Sam Polak. I'm excited about this adventure for numerous reasons, and the one\
  \ you've likely heard me talk about before is the Sovereign Court opportunities\
  \ that tie into the upcoming <a href=\"http://paizo.com/pathfinder/adventurePath/warForTheCrown\"\
  >War for the Crown Adventure Path</a>. It's hard to believe that so much time has\
  \ passed since Crystal Frasier and I first began scheming this crossover. The wait\
  \ to hear everyone's reactions to various scenes (including several that have left\
  \ Thurston Hillman calling me \"a monster” for the past 6 months) seems unbearable,\
  \ but at last our first installation is here!</p> \n    <p>In <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9x0s?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-908-Birthright-Betrayed\"\
  ><i>Birthright Betrayed</i></a>, the Pathfinder Society has an opportunity to study\
  \ relics from the Shining Crusade. The problem is that those same exhibits are in\
  \ a museum the local baron has habitually ransacked to promote his public image,\
  \ in the process shaming his glorious ancestor. It's as much a service to history\
  \ as it is a favor for the Sovereign Court faction to take this baron down a peg,\
  \ particularly once the PCs begin investigating what's really been happening around\
  \ the Taldan city of Ridonport. Even low-level PCs can accomplish big things in\
  \ this scenario and walk away not just feeling like heroes but also being told that\
  \ they saved the day. Sam's made this especially charming by providing numerous\
  \ opportunities to meet and interact with the people of Taldor—not just the nobles\
  \ we see in most Taldan adventures, but also the everyday folks just trying to make\
  \ ends meet. I've included two of my favorite new NPC portraits from this adventure,\
  \ both by Sebastian Gomez.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderSociety/20171129-Calhadionvernisant.jpg\"\

  ></a> \n     <p><i>Illustrations by Sebastian Gomez</i></p>\n    </div> \n    <p>Overall\
  \ it promises to be a great start to this story, which includes a Tier 3–7 scenario\
  \ next month and a Tier 7–11 scenario in January (right before <a href=\"http://paizo.com/pathfinder/adventurePath/warForTheCrown\"\
  >War for the Crown</a> launches in February). This is indicative of a trend you'll\
  \ see in Season 9. Specifically, there are very few officially multi-part series,\
  \ unlike in past seasons. Instead, each faction has an ongoing storyline that we've\
  \ tried to spread over the season as appropriate, and in almost all cases these\
  \ faction scenarios' tiers get higher over time. The hope's that if you want to\
  \ really play all 2–3 adventures with the same PC, you can, but the stories are\
  \ typically partitioned in such a way that you can still have a meaningful experience\
  \ if you use a few different PCs to play the adventures (see the recent pair of\
  \ Scarab Sages scenarios for a good example). This also means that each of the factions\
  \ gets a good level spread over Season 9, so you don't need to be low level to experience\
  \ the Liberty's Edge story or high level to appreciate what the Dark Archive's doing.\
  \ Overall, we're tinkering with how we've always done things to deliver some fun\
  \ stories in different ways.</p> \n    <p>Speaking of traditions, we've made something\
  \ of a tradition of releasing a new replayable scenario around this time of year.\
  \ Linda Zayas-Palmer has increasingly taken the lead on these special projects,\
  \ so it's only right that we hear directly from her about what to expect.</p> \n\
  \    <blockquote> \n     <p>Our second scenario this month is the replayable 3–\
  7 adventure <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9x0t?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-909-Beyond-the-Halflight-Path\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Society Scenario #9–09: Beyond the Halflight Path</i></a>. Like its\
  \ older sister <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9oik?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-807-From-the-Tome-of-Righteous-Repose\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8–07: From the Tome of Righteous Repose</i></a>,\
  \ <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9x0t?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-909-Beyond-the-Halflight-Path\"\
  ><i>Beyond the Halflight Path </i></a>is packed with opportunities for the GM to\
  \ customize her adventure. The story takes the PCs to Kaer Maga, an eclectic city\
  \ whose ancient history refuses to stay buried. It's up to the PCs to get to the\
  \ bottom of a troublesome mystery and strike against its source in the vaults below.\
  \ What is the threat? What is the background behind it? Who even gives the mission\
  \ briefing? All of these depend upon how the GM decides to assemble the story.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Brian Duckwitz really stepped up to the plate in writing this adventure.\
  \ I left a lot of room in the outline for him to come up with possible plots, and\
  \ you'll see many of those ideas in the adventure. I don't want to put spoilers\
  \ here, so I'll just say: check out the Scintillating Halls arcs. They are delightfully\
  \ creepy. When it comes to encounters, think about how many encounters are in typical\
  \ scenario, and then multiply that by around seven. Now imagine adjusting everything\
  \ for four players and giving every last creature its own tactics. Oh, and make\
  \ each of the nine possible villains interesting and distinctive while you are at\
  \ it. It was a serious undertaking, and Brian did an excellent job.</p> \n    </blockquote>\

  \ Pathfinders as for players in real life) everyone travels safely if you're heading\

  \ cheer with others, no matter where you're wintering this year.</p> \n    <p>John\
