  artist: "pirates? Under which dock will she be ambushed by bunyips? And which den\
    \ of thieves will burn when that first fireball flies awry? It's all here, the\
    \ Gold Goblin, Zincher's Arena, St. Caspieran's, the Temple of Besmara... you'll\
    \ just have to wait till next month to find out which is which! Here's a free\
    \ one, though. The Cyphergate? It's that big arch. Enjoy! F. Wesley Schneider\
