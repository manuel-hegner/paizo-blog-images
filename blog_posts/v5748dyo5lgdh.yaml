  \ I've got some secrets to share with you. It's the story of an unlikely group of\

  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <h2 class=\"spaced-header-small\">The Courtier</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>Graceful, talented, and beautiful, Siwar has ingratiated herself into\
  \ the highest courts of the River Kingdoms. She is knowledgeable in topics ranging\
  \ from art to politics and is highly schooled in etiquette. Though her talents might\
  \ lead an observer to think that she is too delicate for the adventuring life, Siwar\
  \ is happy to make eye contact with that observer, smile impishly, and direct him\
  \ to do her bidding.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6801-Siwar.jpg\"\

  spaced-header-small\">The Scholar</h2> \n     <p>In the city of Oenopion, Zarlova\
  \ is a well-known professor at the Hive, an academy of wizards and clerics working\
  \ in concert to unravel mysteries left by the god Nethys. A master of <i>The Book\
  \ of Magic</i>, Zarlova routinely ventures from the halls of academe to spread knowledge\
  \ among the unenlightened. Her mastery of offensive magic makes her a valued ally\
  \ on any adventure.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6802-Zarlova.jpg\"\

  \ class=\"spaced-header-small\">The Legbreaker</h2> \n     <p>Tontelizi's rough-and-tumble\
  \ past began with a stint as an enforcer in his family's shady business. Because\
  \ of his short stature, some mocked him with the nickname \"Legbreaker.\" They soon\
  \ found their ability to walk severely compromised. After retiring from daily enforcement\
  \ detail, Tontelizi found himself missing the simple pleasures of maiming and intimidation.\
  \ He now wields his polearm as a mercenary for fun and profit.</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  \ class=\"spaced-header-small\">The Gamekeeper</h2> \n     <p>Dwarves laboring in\
  \ the mines of Kalsgard have limited exposure to the animals of the forest, but\
  \ Agna has trained in the wilderness, and she's introduced many beasts to the lands\
  \ below the earth. Ready to fight with a weapon in either hand, Agna can make you\
  \ think she's your biggest threat, right before a trained bear attacks you from\
  \ behind.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6804-Agna.jpg\"\

  spaced-header-small\">The Death Whisperer</h2> \n     <p>Wu Shen loves death as\
  \ if it were an actual person. She speaks of death as \"her lover,\" and listeners\
  \ may mistakenly believe she is referring to a mortal. Each time she brings a monster\
  \ to its grisly end, she savors a moment of hope that death will acknowledge her\
  \ as its favorite. To add spice to her devotional gifts, Wu Shen often chooses unique\
  \ or difficult ways to complete her kills.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  spaced-header-small\">The Trickster</h2> \n     <p>Qualzar's heritage includes mischievous\
  \ fey who curdle milk, tie shoelaces together, and generally make nuisances of themselves.\
  \ He claims to not understand why others find his humor malicious, but in truth,\
  \ he doesn't care. He's willing to hurt others for the sake of a pun or a punch\
  \ line, and he's got a book of plucked fairy wings to prove it. His mind-melting\
  \ spell blasts and mesmeric powers are almost always turned on enemies, so it's\
  \ probably safe to adventure with him.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n\

  \ class=\"spaced-header-small\">The Necromancer</h2> \n     <p>The power of the\
  \ dead courses through Darago's thin veins. It's a rare wizard who can traffic with\
  \ the unliving and retain most of his soul, but so far, Darago has resisted the\
  \ baser desires of most necromancers. Still, his chilling voice and devilish sense\
  \ of humor will surprise even the most hardened mercenary. After all, he will happily\
  \ battle at the side of any adventure while she lives... and perhaps for a short\
  \ time thereafter.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6807-Darago.jpg\"\
