  \     <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\">“Fire,” the professor whispered.\
  \ His hands shook as he traced the runes etched onto the walls.</p>\n      <p>The\
  \ Taldan scholar—bald and stooped, somewhat like a pale turtle—had intricate tattoos\
  \ coiling up his arms, neck, and cheek, like her own but of a different style. On\
  \ their first night together, she had asked about the markings. <em>Irezoko</em>,\
  \ he said they were called, borrowed from her own Varisian tradition and a sign\
  \ of his rank in Absalom’s College of Mysteries, the rank of enigma.</p>\n     \
  \ <p>Seoni frowned and scanned the long tunnel. Various support beams of the same\
  \ smooth stone as the walls buttressed its length, and script she did not recognize\
  \ covered the entirety. The symbols were old and worn, done long ago, but she looked\
  \ for inhabitants anyway. There were no signs that the lizardfolk or giant beasts\
  \ from the surface had found this place.</p>\n      <p>“The runes?” her tengu companion\
  \ Korakai asked, prancing forward with a hop. As he did so, the various vials, scroll\
  \ cases, paper talismans, totems, and baubles affixed to his robes and chain shirt\
  \ clinked and slapped musically. An orb of liquid blue light followed at his shoulder.\
  \ Korakai cocked his corvid head one way then the other, peering at the writing.\
  \ “They say ‘fire,’ do they? How ominous. What else do they say?”</p>\n      <p>“\
  It—it will take days,” the scholar said with awe, “perhaps weeks, to decipher. This\
  \ is ancient script, you understand. More than ancient. From the Age of Serpents,\
  \ I suspect!” He turned to them dramatically, his voice echoing in the tunnel.</p>\n\
  \      <p>At his declaration, Korakai tilted his head back the way, and Seoni stared\
  \ unmoved. None of them spoke for several heartbeats. The professor sighed in disappointment\
  \ at their reactions and turned back to the wall. “But see here,” his knobby finger\
  \ tapped one rune. “This says ‘fire,’ I’m sure of it. And look there, and there,\
  \ and here. It’s repeated, see?”</p>\n      <p>“Fire, fire, everywhere,” Korakai\
  \ chuckled nervously. His robes and feathers fluttered in the faint breeze that\
  \ always surrounded him. He tapped the butt of his elaborate staff on the floor.\
  \ The oracle’s fidgeting made noise incessantly. “What do you think it means, Seoni?”\
  </p>\n      <p>“That is why we have the professor,” she said simply, shrugging.</p>\n\
  \      <p>If the old man, Enigma Rodos, heard her, he was too preoccupied to respond.\
  \ Muttering, hands touching each symbol reverently, he combed over the walls everywhere\
  \ Korakai’s light illuminated them.</p>\n      <p>“He’s a funny one, isn’t he?”\
  \ The oracle tapped his staff and jingled his way over to Seoni’s side. She thought\
  \ he was smiling, but it was difficult for most humans to decipher a tengu’s expressions,\
  \ even after several weeks together. As Korakai drew nearer, the breeze surrounding\
  \ him plucked at her cloak and skirts.</p>\n      <p>“Indeed. As I told you, we\
  \ did not need to bring Valeros for this part. The perils were in getting the professor\
  \ here. Other than dying of boredom, I do not see any danger from these forgotten\
  \ tunnels. No need to fear, Korakai.”</p>\n      <p>“If you say so, Seoni,” her\
  \ companion looked left and right, <em>tap-tap-tapping </em>with the staff, which\
  \ was topped by a stylized, silver eye. “Embrace life’s mysteries, yes? Even when\
  \ they’re in a dark, unexplored ruin. It will be fine, you say.” He did not sound\
  \ convinced.</p>\n      <p>Seoni nodded once, and the two of them watched Enigma\
  \ Rodos work. After several minutes, the professor paused to deliberately pull a\
  \ parchment, quill, and inkwell from the pockets of his robes.</p>\n      <p>“Do\
  \ you really think it will take days?” Korakai whispered.</p>\n      <p>“Mmm.” She\
  \ frowned. “Perhaps we can light a torch and leave him to it. He paid us to find\
  \ this place and we have done so. We have no expertise here. Let him do…” she made\
  \ a vague gesture with one tattooed arm, “whatever it is scholars do.”</p>\n   \
  \   <p>“Oh, yes, yes, leave this place, good,” Korakai jangled as he unshouldered\
  \ his backpack and began rummaging through it. “I have one. Professor! We are going\
  \ to light you a torch and head back to camp, yes? You can find it easily enough?\
  \ We will be close if you need anything.”</p>\n      <p>Rodos looked up, confused\
  \ and blinking, as the words slowly sank in. “Yes, that will be fine.”</p>\n   \
  \   <p>“Flint and steel, here we are,” Korakai said, balancing his staff in the\
  \ crook of one arm. With taloned hands he struck once, twice, three times, and a\
  \ spark lit the animal fat on the end of the wooden torch.</p>\n      <p>As soon\
  \ as the flame ignited, several of the runes around them flared in bright orange\
  \ light. Then others, spreading out like an infection.</p>\n      <p>Or perhaps\
  \ a wildfire.</p>\n      <p>Rodos gasped. “What—what did you do?”</p>\n      <p>“\
  Fire?” Korakai laughed anxiously, waving the torch. “You must be right on that translation!\
  \ Keep up the good—Aaaiiiggghhh!” He jumped back on four-toed taloned feet.</p>\n\
  \      <p>Flames filled the chamber with a great <em>WHOOOSH!</em> Rodos scrambled\
  \ away on hands and knees, nearly engulfed. As Seoni watched, wide-eyed, the flames\
  \ coalesced into distinct shapes, each moving independently while still part of\
  \ the same conflagration. It took her a heartbeat to realize that she faced not\
  \ one raging blaze, but a dozen smaller ones, each in the shape of a halfling-sized\
  \ humanoid. The fiery figures prowled forward, moving like a pack of wolves.</p>\n\
  \      <p>“Professor! Away!” she barked. “Get Valeros and the others, quickly!”\
  </p>\n      <p>Seoni dashed to one side of the tunnel, her arms weaving symbols\
  \ in the air. Instinctively she plunged her consciousness inward, where a roiling\
  \ mass of memories awaited her. Images and voices from experiences before her birth\
  \ flooded her mind. In her childhood, this sort of bombardment threatened to overwhelm\
  \ her. Now, she utilized her tattoos; for her they were not a sign of rank but instead\
  \ a map, a reminder of her ancestral blood and the thousand generations of spellcasters\
  \ who preceded her. Power flowed through her. Power and knowledge. And Seoni channeled\
  \ it through the detailed patterns across her skin, focusing the chaos into her\
  \ spells.</p>\n      <p>“Frost and ice!” she called to Korakai. “Quench the flames!”\
  \ As she said the words, an orb of biting cold formed around one of the fiery figures.\
  \ Steam filled the tunnel as the elemental screeched like a teakettle.</p>\n   \
  \   <p>“You mean to fight?!” the oracle gasped. “But… oh, bother.”</p>\n      <p>Korakai\
  \ tamped his staff to the ground and the silver eye atop it flared. Geometric sigils,\
  \ triangles and circles of blue light, spun around the head of the oracle’s weapon\
  \ and, as they did, his free hand swirled with liquid, azure energy. The tengu had\
  \ explained to Seoni that he could glimpse the First Storm that existed before creation,\
  \ when the planes were nothing more than a roiling sea of lightning, wind, and rain.\
  \ It was these fleeting glimpses, he speculated, that allowed the many gods and\
  \ goddesses of weather to grant him their blessings.</p>\n      <p>The oracle reached\
  \ out with his tempest’s touch, the water leaping from his outstretched talon to\
  \ the nearest figure. More steam and high-pitched screeching let Seoni know that\
  \ Korakai’s attacks were as deadly to these creatures as her own orbs of frost.</p>\n\

  \ response. The collective experience of Seoni’s ancestors guided her every movement\
