  \   <h1>The Future of Pathfinder Society Organized Play, Part XX: Gen Con Is Here!</h1>\
  \ \n    <p class=\"date\">Monday, August 1, 2011</p> \n    <p>This is it, folks!\
  \ The 20th installment in the Future of Pathfinder Society Organized Play blog series\
  \ by yours truly. On this, the first of August, we're literally just hours from\
  \ the kickoff of Pathfinder Society's fourth year, Season 3: The Year of the Ruby\
  \ Phoenix!</p> \n    <p>So what can Pathfinders expect from Gen Con this year? Well,\
  \ for starters, we have an exclusive Chronicle that we'll give to all players and\
  \ volunteer GMs who play or run either a scenario or delve event in the Pathfinder\
  \ Society room (rooms 231–234)—the largest such space we've ever had at Gen Con,\
  \ I might add.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb180\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderSociety/RubyPheonix.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderSociety/RubyPheonix_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> \"From ashes of Shadow, the Ruby Phoenix rises.\"\n    </div> \n\
  \    <p>Everyone who plays a session of either type of event will get a key (or\
  \ a coin that can be turned in for multiple keys) to possibly open our HQ Treasure\
  \ Chest. Inside is a chance to win a number of great prizes including Pathfinder\
  \ Society branded memorabilia, signed copies of Pathfinder Roleplaying Game hardcovers,\
  \ GameMastery map products, Pathfinder Tales novels, and 15 different Gen Con boons\
  \ for use with your Pathfinder Society character!</p> \n    <p>\"But, Mark,\" you're\
  \ surely saying, \"all the Pathfinder Society events at the show are sold out, or\
  \ nearly so!\" Well, yes. That's true. But we'll have up to 5 tables of hour-long\
  \ delve events running through most of the day to give those who can't get into\
  \ ticketed games a chance to play Pathfinder and possibly win some of the above-mentioned\
  \ boons and prizes. So even if you didn't get a spot in one of the over 400 tables\
  \ of Pathfinder Society going on at the show, stop by rooms 231–234 to get your\
  \ Pathfinder on at your convenience!</p> \n    <p>And Paizo's presence isn't just\
  \ in the organized play rooms, either. We'll have almost everyone in the company\
  \ in the booth at one time or another, so stop by and see who you can chat up or\
  \ have sign your new copy of <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy8mcz\"><i>Ultimate Combat</i></a>.\
  \ On Saturday at 3:00 we'll be having our annual Pathfinder costume party, so if\
  \ you have an iconic getup or even a costume for your favorite personal Pathfinder\
  \ character, stop by the booth then for group pictures and a chance to win some\
  \ great prizes as the fans on paizo.com vote to choose their favorite costumed attendee.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>I could write another three pages on all the great stuff we have in store\
  \ for everyone at Gen Con, but as I leave in less than 24 hours for the fine city\
  \ of Indianapolis, I'd better cut this short (sic) and get those last few little\
  \ details ironed out before I pack up my travel toothbrush and prepare for my appointment\
  \ with the TSA. See you all in Indianapolis!</p> \n    <p>Mark Moreland<br> <i>Developer</i></p>\
