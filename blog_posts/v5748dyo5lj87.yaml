  description\">Last week we took a look at some magical foes from the pages of the\
  \ upcoming <a href=\"/products/btpy9oo7\"><em>Villain Codex</em></a>, with an in-depth\
  \ look at the Arcane Society. This week we're headed into the wilderness to explore\
  \ some of the villains who operate on the fringes of society!</p> \n    <h2>Nature's\
  \ Scourge</h2> \n    <p>No villain group embodies the wild as much as Nature's Scourge,\
  \ a group founded by a druid known as the Blight Caller. I'll let the Renewer (their\
  \ PR expert) explain it to you:</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><i>\"Civilization\
  \ claims to value progress, but it inevitably seeks stagnation. Its people take\
  \ their coins to the market and buy what they have no incentive to learn how to\
  \ provide for themselves. Farmers and hunters rely the least on civilization, but\
  \ they enable others to survive who would starve if left to their own devices. Artisans\
  \ churn out hundreds of similar items, ready for those who could never replicate\
  \ their work to acquire in seconds. Worst of all are the ones who wield the most\
  \ power in civilization. I cannot imagine a more pathetic creature than a noble,\
  \ swaddled in silk and gold, forcing others to attend to their every need like grotesquely\
  \ oversized babies. Stagnation is not natural. A forest knows that it must sometimes\
  \ burn to clear the debris on its floor and make way for new seeds. If civilization\
  \ insists upon clinging to its detritus, then we will be the fire, and we will nurture\
  \ new seeds in our wake. Always seek to learn, grow, and move forward. We are not\
  \ immune to stagnation, and we will cleanse it from our own ranks when we must.\"\
  </i></p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Today we're going to take a look at the Blig...\
  \ One moment please, technical difficulties!</p> \n    <p>OK, Nature's Scourge author\
  \ Linda Zayas-Palmer has agreed to release me from the <i>entangle</i> spell in\
  \ exchange for previewing the Blight Caller's trusted ally, the leshy known as the\
  \ Wrathbringer.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <h3>Wrathbinger</h3> \n     <p class=\"\

  \ \n    <p>The Blight Caller created the Wrathbringer several years ago. The unusual\
  \ circumstances of this leshy's creation ritual imbued it with emotions that plant\
  \ creatures can normally never experience. Centuries before the Blightcaller created\
  \ him, a powerful druid bound the leshy's spirit to a sacred grove of fungi. By\
  \ the time the Blightcaller arrived in the grove, the delicate fungi were dying,\
  \ poisoned by waste that nearby settlements had dumped into the water. The Blightcaller\
  \ managed to draw the leshy's spirit into a body before it died with the grove,\
  \ but doing so required him to give a small piece of his own spirit as well. This\
  \ sacrifice formed a connection between the druid and the leshy and imbued the leshy\
  \ with the rage against civilization that burned so strongly in the druid's heart.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The Wrathbringer is surly and quick to anger. However, it is a dependable\
  \ ally. The Blight Caller trusts it more than any other member of nature's scourge\
  \ and has given it several valuable gifts, including a breastplate made from the\
  \ hide of the same dragon as his own armor and a pair of slippers made from the\
  \ magically preserved remnants of the leshy's former grove.</p> \n    <p>Oh my,\
  \ what are Nature's Wrath and <i>fungal slippers</i>? Will either of those explain\
  \ how this plant is benefiting from raging song?</p> \n    <h2>Merry Outlaws</h2>\
  \ \n    <p>Some villains aren't evil, and at least according to the locals, the\
  \ Merry Outlaws might be full-on good guys. They rob from the wealthy and are known\
  \ to distribute wealth to the poor and downtrodden. But there are others, those\
  \ on whom the Merry Outlaws have preyed, who claim that there are two sides to every\
  \ tale. What is the truth about this Robin Hood-style bands of miscreants? What\
  \ will the PCs decide to do if confronted with such a group? These questions make\
  \ the Merry Outlaws perfect for a nuanced adventure with shades of grey.</p> \n\
  \    <h2>Ruthless Brigands</h2> \n    <p>The ruthless brigands are mercenaries,\
  \ pure and simple. If you pay them, they might even defend your city from the savage\
  \ marauders or protect your carriage from the Merry Outlaws, but their loyalty follows\
  \ the coin. That's not to say they're all evil, in fact, the reluctant witty jury-rigger\
  \ shown here is good-aligned, yearning for the old days when they would fight for\
  \ noble causes and increasingly regretting his life decisions.</p> \n    <h2>Savage\
  \ Marauders</h2> \n    <p>The savage marauders are a marauding barbarian tribe who\
  \ pillage the soft civilized folk, kill or capture the adults, and indoctrinating\
  \ the children to join the tribe. This gives them a slightly more multicultural\
  \ make-up than other barbarian tribes. Everyone in the tribe must prove her strength\
  \ (in fact, the Fiend-Born Rager may some day grow to challenge the Crimson Lord\
  \ should he show any signs of weakness), so that badass marauder down there with\
  \ the earthbreaker and the icicle fingers? Yeah, she's actually a sorcerer!</p>\
  \ \n    <h2>Scandalous Pirates</h2> \n    <p>Not everywhere in the wilderness is\
  \ on land, and the scandalous pirates are a scourge upon the seas. They're organized\
  \ with several captains all under the auspices of the Vile Admiral, which allows\
  \ you to use them as a squabbling but vaguely cohesive group or as individual pirates\
  \ (if, say, you needed an extra captain quickly in a <i>Skull and Shackles</i> game).</p>\
