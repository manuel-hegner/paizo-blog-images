  \ by Fire</h2> \n    <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\"\
  >Sandwiched between a boulder and the side of a mountain, with a burning skeleton\
  \ trying to grasp at him from above, Jeddah found himself thinking of his wife and\
  \ son—the two people who meant the most to him in this world—and silently said his\
  \ good-byes.</p> \n     <p>The burning skeleton was trying to clamber over the boulder\
  \ but seemed to find no purchase in its mindless pursuit of Jed. It flailed at him,\
  \ flaming arms outstretched, the intense heat singeing hair and blistering flesh\
  \ on his sword arm. He parried with his rapier as best he could, managing to lop\
  \ off a few finger bones, but at some point the burning skeleton—and the other undead\
  \ skeletons with it—would figure out how to reach him.</p> \n     <p>I don't want\
  \ to die, Jed thought. I want to go home. </p> \n     <p>Then he remembered something\
  \ his father had told him long ago: \"Home is something you earn when the battle's\
  \ won. That's Cayden's way.\"</p> \n     <p>And in that moment, Jed's mind snapped\
  \ into focus. He looked around and found a large rock within reach. He grasped it\
  \ and hurled it up at the burning skeleton, connecting with its jaw. The jawbone\
  \ fell down into the crevasse with Jed, nearly singeing his arm. </p> \n     <p>The\
  \ burning skeleton disappeared for a moment, leaving Jed just enough time to get\
  \ his bearings. <i>Go home. Earn the </i>right <i>to go home</i>. And so he began\
  \ mentally ticking through his options, much as he would check off a recipe for\
  \ one of his brews back at Cayden's Rest. </p> \n     <p>The burning skeleton reappeared\
  \ above him, its jaw gone, and surmounted the boulder in front of him with renewed\
  \ vigor. It reached the top and crouched, ready to leap—just when Jed remembered\
  \ his prayers from the last evening.</p> \n     <p>\"Cayden, give me the strength\
  \ to defeat the enemies of good!\" he shouted, gripping his tankard tightly. He\
  \ felt a surge of divine energy run through him, felt his muscles tighten and grow.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>Jed braced his feet against the boulder—and pushed.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>With a mighty rumble, the boulder before him started to move. Jed redoubled\
  \ his efforts, just as the burning skeleton prepared to leap.</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ boulder gave way and began rolling. </p> \n     <p>The burning skeleton staggered\
  \ atop the rock, trying to regain its balance, but then tumbled backward—right into\
  \ the path of the boulder. It rolled onto the creature with a crunch and a shower\
  \ of sparks and flame, then kept going down the mountain. More crunching sounds\
  \ followed—branches and trees and the bones of the undead. </p> \n     <p>Jed sat\
  \ up, freed from his trap, and looked down the mountain as the stone, easily six\
  \ feet high, gained momentum. It crashed into other rocks, dislodging them and creating\
  \ a small but noisy avalanche down the side of the mountain, leaving rubble and\
  \ tree branches and broken bone in its wake.</p> \n     <p>He laughed. A quiet laugh,\
  \ fueled by relief at being alive. </p> \n     <p>Jed struggled to his feet, but\
  \ found his right ankle nearly useless. He thought to spare a moment to heal the\
  \ wound, but the sound of clicking bones distracted him. </p> \n     <p>Three skeletons—\
  thank Cayden, they were not aflame—moved toward him, arms outstretched and flailing.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>\"Not this time,\" he muttered, grasping his tankard once more\
  \ and raising his voice. \"In the name of Cayden Cailean, he who gives me strength\
  \ and succor, I banish you!\"</p> \n     <p>The skeletons stopped dead in their\
  \ tracks for an impossibly long moment—then turned and fled back down the trail.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>\"Sweet barleybrew, it worked,\" he muttered, his smile returning.\
  \ \"Thanks, Cayden.\"</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb360\">\n      <a href=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-CrisisOfFaith-BurningSkeleton.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n      <br> <i>The undead of the Nogortha Necropolis come in many forms.</i>\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>After a quick prayer over his ankle to heal it, Jed began\
  \ climbing down the mountain, half-sliding down the trail left in the boulder's\
  \ wake. It was a good five hundred feet to the valley floor, where the torchlight\
  \ still guttered among the barrows. He was prepared this time to face any undead\
  \ he came upon, but the only evidence of them he found were the crushed bones on\
  \ his path. </p> \n     <p>Reaching the valley, he walked as quietly as he could\
  \ among the mounds until he came with about a hundred yards of the torchlight. Crouching\
  \ behind a massive barrow, Jed peeked around one side to see a half-dozen zombies\
  \ standing all too still in the light. The red-robed figure was there as well, and\
  \ was talking to someone—though Jed could not see whom.</p> \n     <p>Jed quietly\
  \ moved closer, hoping to see who else was there and perhaps catch a bit of the\
  \ conversation. Hiding behind a small barrow, he edged around the corner—and his\
  \ eyes grew wide.</p> \n     <p>Silvestrae was still captive, and had been tied\
  \ up with her hands behind her back. She sat on the ground with a zombie standing\
  \ guard over her. And so, too, had Corogan been captured—how, Jed could not say—\
  and was heavily bound in chains, lying on his side.</p> \n     <p>The figure in\
  \ red laughed, but Jed couldn't make out any more words. It was clear the figure\
  \ was in command of the zombies, simply because no others seemed to be there, and\
  \ it had what appeared to be a wand in its hand.</p> \n     <p>After a moment, the\
  \ figure removed its hood—and Jed saw horns upon its otherwise human head. It was\
  \ a hellspawn. With the Cheliax border not far away, the prospect filled Jed with\
  \ dread... and anger.</p> \n     <p>Settling his mind, Jed tried to piece together\
  \ a strategy. He could glimpse chainmail beneath the folds of the fiendling's robes,\
  \ and a spear leaned against a tomb nearby. That likely made the hellspawn a cleric\
  \ of some foul deity or another—which would explain the undead as well. </p> \n\
  \     <p>Peering from behind the mound, Jed saw a pair of bodies on the ground near\
  \ the very edge of the torchlight. Both were slashed and stabbed with great force,\
  \ and Jed assumed they were Corogan's work—which was good, because there appeared\
  \ to be no other living opponents aside from the hellspawn. </p> \n     <p>Once\
  \ again, Jed mentally ran through the few options he had at his disposal. The one\
  \ that made the most sense seemed to have the highest chance of failure—but also\
  \ the greatest boon if it succeeded. Typical Cayden, Jed thought. Only the crazy\
  \ options for me.</p> \n     <p>He tried to think of better plan, but nothing came\
  \ to him. Pulling his pants up with a sigh and readying both rapier and tankard,\
  \ Jed stepped out from his cover—and ran straight toward the hellspawn. </p> \n\
  \     <p>The fiendling's head whipped about, revealing a hate-filled countenance—\
  and the crest of a noble house of Cheliax around his neck. Jed willed his legs to\
  \ pump faster, but the hellspawn simply raised his wand and spoke a single word.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Jed felt magical energy surround his body—a dark magic, fueled by infernal\
  \ power—and willed himself to keep moving. He felt his pace slow a moment, but then\
  \ the magic washed over him and faded.</p> \n     <p>Jed raised his tankard and\
  \ focused his own power. \"Cayden! Hold him!\" he shouted.</p> \n     <p>The hellspawn\
  \ froze. </p> \n     <p>Jed ran into the center of the barrows just as the zombies\
  \ began shambling toward him. One of the creatures was close enough to get in a\
  \ good swipe, but its filthy claws skittered over Jed's chain shirt. Reflexively,\
  \ Jed lashed out with his rapier, slashing the undead across its neck. It staggered\
  \ back and fell. </p> \n     <p>Turning to the others, Jed brandished the symbol\
  \ of his god once more. \"In the name of Cayden, I banish you!\" </p> \n     <p>They\
  \ stopped. And fled. </p> \n     <p>Jed turned and dashed over to the fiendling,\
  \ plucking the wand from his still-frozen hand and relieving him of the dagger at\
  \ his belt. He used the weapon to cut Silvestrae loose, even as she eyed him wordlessly\
  \ with something between incredulity and amazement. </p> \n     <p>\"Get Corogan,\"\
  \ she said once her bonds were cut. \"I'll keep an eye on our friend here.\" The\
  \ half-elf got to her feet and found her bow and other gear nearby, and then stationed\
  \ herself a short distance from the hellspawn, arrow nocked and aimed straight for\
  \ his eye. </p> \n     <p>Jed managed to free Corogan from his chains—they were\
  \ both heavy and numerous, but there was no lock. \"That was kind of dangerous,\
  \ what you did there,\" Corogan said with a grin. \"You are a Caydenite, aren't\
  \ you.\" </p> \n     <p>\"I am, it seems,\" Jed replied. \"Apparently you have to\
  \ do something really stupid to get him to help you. How did they capture you?\"\
  </p> \n     <p>Corogan nodded at the hellspawn. \"The wand. I'm surprised it didn't\
  \ affect you.\"</p> \n     <p>Jed helped the half-orc to his feet. \"Cayden favors\
  \ the foolish, I guess. Now let's see about that devilborn.\"</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ hellspawn was, in the end, the bastard son of a minor house of Cheliax and an\
  \ overly ambitious sort. Under Silvestrae's surprisingly menacing interrogation,\
  \ the fiendling confessed he had sought to carve out a holding of his own in the\
  \ necropolis and force the government of Cheliax to recognize the claim. </p> \n\
  \     <p>\"Not that the Chels would do that,\" Corogan explained to Jed once they\
  \ were back on the road to Augustana. Behind them walked their captive, his mouth\
  \ bound by cloth to keep him from speaking. \"Cheliax would love nothing more than\
  \ to take Andoran for its own,\" he went on. \"But the Chels know we'd put up one\
  \ hell of a fight for every square inch. This bastard would've found himself hung\
  \ out to dry no matter what.\"</p> \n     <p>\"And eventually he'd run out of bodies\
  \ to animate,\" Silvestrae said, her mood improved significantly. \"What I still\
  \ don't get is what happened to Rafe down in Augustana.\" </p> \n     <p>Corogan\
  \ shrugged. \"If this one has something to do with it, we'll get it out of him,\"\
  \ he said, turning to give the hellspawn a wicked grin. \"And if not... then we'll\
  \ have more work to do.\"</p> \n     <p style=\"text-align: center;\">∗∗∗</p> \n\
  \     <p>Some nights later, Cayden's Rest was rollicking once more—and its brew-priest\
  \ was once again among the revelers, this time telling the stories of his own adventures\
  \ and, in good priestly fashion, weaving in a lesson as well.</p> \n     <p>\"I\
  \ admit, I was shaken,\" Jed said to a large table of drinkers, all staring at him\
  \ with rapt attention. \"I'm no adventurer. Just look at me!\" he added, turning\
  \ to show off his profile, complete with belly. After the laughter subsided, he\
  \ went on: \"But you have to have faith. Cayden put me there for a reason, to show\
  \ me what it means to put yourself in peril for what you believe in. But if you\
  \ do that—if you fight for what's good and right with all your being—well, I think\
  \ he'll be there for you, as he was for me. And he'll bring you back here to drink\
  \ his ale and tell your tale.\" </p> \n     <p>Tankards were raised at this, and\
  \ Cayden's name duly praised. Jed turned and saw Maeve smiling at him from the door\
  \ to the kitchen, holding Gant close to her as they listened. She was, of course,\
  \ quite relieved at his safe return, though less pleased when young Gant had immediately\
  \ asked to begin practice with the rapier. </p> \n     <p>\"So, Jeddah Cailean!\"\
  \ a woman asked above the din. Jed turned and saw Silvestrae standing among the\
  \ throng, her own tankard raised and a smile on her face. \"Will you be coming with\
  \ us again if we need you?\"</p> \n     <p>Jed turned back to Maeve, whose eyebrows\
  \ were arched in that way only displeased wives can manage, even though her smile\
  \ remained. All Jed could do was shrug at her. </p> \n     <p>\"If Cayden wills\
  \ it, then I can't argue,\" he replied. \"It's as simple as that.\"</p> \n     <p><i>Michael\
