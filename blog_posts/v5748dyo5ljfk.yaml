  \ Are a Few of My Favorite Things</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Friday, January 6,\

  >Very soon, dear readers, copies of <a href=\"/products/btpy9qib\"><em>Qadira: Jewel\
  \ of the East</em></a> will be in your hands (or available to be in your hands,\
  \ if you're not a subscriber), so this seems like an excellent time to list off\
  \ my ten favorite things about Qadira and/or this book. Behold:</p> \n    <p><b>1.\
  \ The \"Adventuring In Qadira\" section:</b> These 24 pages of mysteries, perils,\
  \ ancient secrets, and general weirdness give glimpses of locations like the razor-edged\
  \ obsidian labyrinth of the Lady of the Burnt Lands; Ihalar, a massive underground\
  \ city; Ushumgal, a banking center probably run by bronze dragons; the deadly ruins\
  \ of Qumarin, from which explorers emerge blinded, their faces branded with wheels\
  \ of wings, eyes, and fire; and the Tower of Winds, set among a sea of colorful\
  \ grasses haunted by strange beings who ask visitors a single question to which\
  \ there is no correct answer. There's also a lot more detail about sites we've mentioned\
  \ before, like the harpy-haunted ruins of Al-Bashir, the military training grounds\
  \ of Omash, and the twisted gnoll settlement of Shadun.</p> \n    <p><b>2. My favorite\
  \ piece of art ever:</b> Look at this gloriousness. It's the adventurer equivalent\
  \ of having your cat sleeping on your keyboard when you need to get work done. The\
  \ poor lady just wants to figure out where these tracks go, and her lion animal\
  \ companion is demanding that she play with him NOW.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \     <br> <i>Illustration by Lance Red</i>\n    </div> \n    <p><b>3. John Compton's\
  \ patronage system:</b> In Qadira, getting ahead is all about who you know and what\
  \ they can do for you. John has put together a brilliant system for navigating the\
  \ currents of Qadiran society, gaining access to the elite, and benefitting from\
  \ your connections.</p> \n    <p><b>4. Keleshite ethnicities:</b> Did you think\
  \ \"Keleshite\" described a single culture or people? If you did, that's understandableâ€”\
  that's what most people from Avistan think, too. But the Padishah Empire of Kelesh\
  \ is home to many different peoples and cultures, making \"Keleshite\" more of an\
  \ umbrella term, like \"Avistani\" or \"Tian,\" than a specific ethnicity like \"\
  Ulfen\" or \"Shoanti.\" Learn about the six major cultures that formed the Empire,\
  \ as well as close to a dozen ethnic minorities common in Qadira. There are also\
  \ details about how non-humans and different classes fit into Qadiran society, from\
  \ tieflings pretending to be emberkin aasimars to Paraheen dwarf weaponsmiths, and\
  \ Taldan brawlers to the pyrokineticists of the Imperial Forces.</p> \n    <p><b>5.\
  \ This other piece of art, which is also my favorite piece of art ever:</b> It's\
  \ a CYCLOPS WITH A MIGRAINE. I empathize so much, buddy.</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Illustration by Eric Kenji</i>\n    </div> \n    <p><b>6. Horses!</b>\
  \ If you like playing mounted characters, especially if you like playing mounted\
  \ characters who ride horses, you're going to want this book. From new tricks for\
  \ your horse animal companion, to genie-touched horses with elemental powers, to\
  \ information on the horse-breeding tribes of Al-Zabrit and their unique cavalier\
  \ order, this book is packed with goodies for riders.</p> \n    <p><b>7. The clothes:</b>\
  \ There are so many well-dressed people in these pages. Look at this magnificently\
  \ attired guy. Even his horse is dapper as hell.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Illustration by Anson Tan</i>\n    </div> \n    <p><b>8. Creepy\
  \ desert fey:</b> I'm not going to spoil it, but it's about time we had one of these.</p>\
  \ \n    <p><b>9. Sunsinger skalds:</b> I know, you hear \"skald\" and you think\
  \ \"Viking bard,\" right? Well, everything's different in the desert, and skalds\
  \ there channel the powers of fire and sunlight in service of the goddess Sarenrae.\
  \ Oh, and there's also a solar sorcerer bloodline. Qadira has a lot of people who\
  \ are ON FIRE: both in the sense of being badass, and also literally on fire.</p>\
  \ \n    <p><b>10. Kelish:</b> While working out names for places and people in Qadira,\
  \ I put together a phonology document to ensure consistency (and to help me figure\
  \ out ways to suggest layers of history with names that didn't follow those conventions).\
  \ That document turned into a lexicon, and eventually into a reference grammar for\
  \ the Kelish language. I could geek out about it for 10,000 more words or so, but\
  \ instead, I'll just note that it drops the copula in the present tense, has a triconsonantal\
  \ root system (like Arabic, Hebrew, etc.), and lacks grammatical gender (like Turkish).</p>\
  \ \n    <h2>Bonus: Introduction to Kelish</h2> \n    <p>Kelish started out as a\
  \ trade language: early Keleshite merchants realized that their tongue, now known\
  \ as Old Keleshite, was proving an impediment to spreading their influence, due\
  \ to sounds non-native speakers found difficult and grammatical features they found\
  \ baffling. So they created a simplified and more regular form of the language,\
  \ with phonology more similar to that of common tongues outside of Casmaron and\
  \ with more regular grammar. Old Keleshite is still used in religious ceremonies\
  \ and among some of the more isolated desert tribes, but these days, almost everyone\
  \ in Kelesh speaks Kelish as their native tongue.</p> \n    <p>Like many Semitic\
  \ languages, Kelish is written using an abjad rather than an alphabet (which is\
  \ to say it's written using only consonants). Many consonants have both a \"soft\"\
  \ and a \"hard\" version (e.g. a single consonant can be pronounced either as b\
  \ or as v depending on context). The transliterations below are simplified and may\
  \ not reflect the way the word would be spelled in Kelish script.</p> \n    <p>Kelish\
  \ pronunciation: Kelish has six vowel sounds, five of which (<i>a, e, i, o, u</i>,\
  \ which are pronounced similarly to Romance language vowels) have long and short\
  \ versions. The sixth is found in unstressed syllables and can be either pronounced\
  \ as a schwa sound or left silent. It has a few consonants that differ from their\
  \ English pronunciations. The <i>kh</i> sound is pronounced like the <i>ch</i> in\
  \ the German pronunciation of <i>Bach</i>, or the Scottish <i>loch</i>. The <i>r</i>\
  \ sound is trilled, as in Spanish or Italian, but also exists in a \"softened\"\
  \ version (usually transliterated <i>rh</i> or <i>gh</i>), which is pronounced like\
  \ the French r. An apostrophe (') indicates a glottal stop.</p> \n    <p>Stress\
  \ generally falls on the final syllable of the word. Stress on non-final syllables\
  \ is indicated in the transliterations below with a doubled consonant after the\
  \ lengthened vowel. (<i>adirah</i> is pronounced ah-dee-RAH, but aninnu is pronounced\
  \ ah-NEE-nu.)</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <h3>Greetings</h3> \n     <p>Hello<br>\
  \ <i>adirah</i><br> (ah-dee-RAH)</p> \n     <p>Goodbye<br> <i>baraqqti bshlim</i>\

  \ et drejem</i> (lee-ehkh-rah-BAH moo-tzeh-ee-MEEL eht dray-JEM)</p> \n     <p>We\
  \ are not strangers, for our hearts are old friends.<br> <i>aninnu la reyevem, qaru\
  \ qelebeiniannu ekhum qidumum</i><br> (ah-NEEN-oo lah reh-yay-VEHM, kah-ROO keh-lay-bay-ee-nee-AH-noo\
  \ eh-KHOOM kee-doo-MOOM)</p> \n     <p>Hold my wine and watch this!<br> <i>bashaddti\
  \ et yenananni w ri'oyeti et eleh</i><br> (bah-SHAD-tee eht yey-na-NAHN-ee wuh reeh-oh-yeh-TEE\
  \ eht eh-LAY)</p> \n     <h3>Useful Phrases for People Who Annoy You</h3> \n   \
  \  <p>Be quiet. I haven't had my coffee yet.<br> <i>batallti. la halli lishqai et\
  \ kahvenni udina</i><br> (bah-TAHL-tee. lah HAH-lee leesh-kie (like \"die\") oo-dee-NAH)</p>\
  \ \n     <p>No horse will carry you.<br> <i>ianu shisah illi lihi'enubshadah et\
  \ atah</i><br> (ee-ah-NOO shee-SAH EE-lee lee-HEEH-eh-noob-shah-DAH eht ah-TAH)</p>\
  \ \n     <p>May you fall in love with a genie.<br> <i>deyah akhalkhallti et jani'ah</i><br>\
  \ (day-YAH ah-khal-KHAL-tee eht jah-neeh-AH)</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>I\
