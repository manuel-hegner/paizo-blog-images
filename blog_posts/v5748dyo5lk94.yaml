  \ World</h1> \n   <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"> \n    <p class=\"date\">Friday,\
  \ November 10, 2017</p> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Sure, we can probably\
  \ all name adventures named after their big, spooky destination—anything from <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy9986?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-6-06-Hall-of-the-Flesh-Eaters\"\
  ><em>Hall of the Flesh Eaters</em></a> to <a href=\"/products/btpy89c9?Pathfinder-Module-Crypt-of-the-Everflame\"\
  ><em>Crypt of the Everflame</em></a> to <a href=\"/products/btpy9dz6?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-94-Ice-Tomb-of-the-Giant-Queen\"\
  ><em>Ice Tomb of the Giant Queen</em></a>. Yet for all the gutsy action that takes\
  \ place in these fanes of dark deities and towers of trash-talking tyrants, a big\
  \ part of adventuring isn't about where you're going but how you got there. That\
  \ means crossing the wilderness, the great nameless expanses that for many of us\
  \ boil down to random encounters and conveniently forgetting to track rations.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>So why is there such a dearth of adventures about exploration? One possibility\
  \ is that location-based dungeon crawls lend themselves to more evocative titles,\
  \ whereas stories about getting from Point A to Point B could as readily be named\
  \ \"The Ambushes Happen at Midnight,\" \"A Tragic Series of Fortitude Saves,\" or\
  \ the ever-popular \"We Cast Teleport.\" Sure, we have some beautiful exceptions\
  \ to this trend like the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/kingmaker\">Kingmaker\
  \ Adventure Path</a>, but I'm going to posit we've really been waiting for fun ways\
  \ to engage with the wilds and weave them more fully into our narratives.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Enter <a href=\"/products/btpy9ujo?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Ultimate-Wilderness\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Wilderness</em></a>, which hits shelves later this\
  \ month. Whereas <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lk8h?Force-of-Nature\">Stephen discussed\
  \ shifters</a> and <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lk8p?From-the-Wilderness-to-Your-Table\"\
  >Linda waxed poetic about leshys</a> in earlier blogs, I'm excited to share some\
  \ highlights from Chapters 4 and 5, which cover wilderness rules and companion creatures\
  \ respectively.</p> \n    <h2>Chapter 4: Mastering the Wild</h2> \n    <p>I'd break\
  \ down Chapter 4 into three major themes: travel, resources, and setting.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Travel's all about the making the wilderness experience more interesting.\
  \ Full disclosure: I'm often a GM, so my definition of \"more interesting\" quickly\
  \ gravitates to things that can kill or inconvenience the player characters. Like\
  \ me, you might adore the Hazards and Disasters section (pages 146–151), which has\
  \ rules for everything from brambles to volcanic eruptions to something cruel called\
  \ \"vampire orchids.\" Likewise, the Weather (pages 165–171) and Traps (172–173)\
  \ sections are quite charming, providing not just a more robust system for determining\
  \ what the weather's like outside, but also the rules for a swinging log trap that\
  \ can knock out the party's wizard faster than you can say \"martial-caster disparity.\"\
  \ When I'm on the other side of the GM screen, I really enjoy being the party cartographer,\
  \ so I quite like the Discovery and Exploration section (pages 124–127), which provides\
  \ an easy-to-use, overarching rules system for exploring wilderness expanses, uncovering\
  \ sites of interest, and turning the experience of reaching a dungeon into more\
  \ than a brief travel montage. Perhaps the real gem is Spells of the Wild (pages\
  \ 156–161), which provides a deeper look at common wilderness-oriented spells like\
  \ pass without trace, diminish plants, and wind walk, particularly with an eye for\
  \ how these spells can contribute to (but not necessarily bypass) wilderness exploration.</p>\

  ></a> \n     <p><i>Illustrations by Roberto Pitturru</i></p>\n    </div> \n    <p>Resources\
  \ cover all the great reasons the PCs would want to enter the wilderness voluntarily.\
  \ Love free stuff (tends to share an answer with \"Do you have a character?\")?\
  \ No doubt you'd love to be able to salvage components for alchemical gear, magic\
  \ items, and costly spell components using the new Foraging and Salvaging section\
  \ (pages 134–135). How about commemorating your latest kill with the Trophies and\
  \ Treasures section (page 162–164), which provides ways to collect mementos, skins,\
  \ claws, and more that you can use to create new items—which vary based on the trophies\
  \ you collect—and remind you of your awesome deeds? Want to get more mileage out\
  \ of Profession (herbalist)? Me too! Now you can with the new Herbalism rules (pages\
  \ 152–155). But wait, there's one more prize awaiting you, and it's one of the requests\
  \ I've heard most for Pathfinder RPG: Harvesting Poisons (pages 142–145), allowing\
  \ you to at last extract the poison glands from one beast and jab them into another.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Finally, I'd like to linger for a moment on the setting resources, which\
  \ cover two easily-incorporated pieces of Golarion lore that bring the wilds to\
  \ life: the First World (128–133) and the Green Faith (136–141). The First World\
  \ is the \"first draft\" of the world as we know it, having been plastered over\
  \ with a new reality by the gods. That suits the native fey just fine, though every\
  \ once and a while the boundaries between the two realms grow thin and allow enterprising\
  \ explorers back and forth. If you like what you see, I recommend also checking\
  \ out <a href=\"/products/btpy9op9?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-The-First-World-Realm-of-the-Fey\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: The First World, Realm of the Fey</em></a>. Meanwhile,\
  \ think of the Green Faith as the venerable religion that doesn't just seem to predate\
  \ worshipping the gods; it spurns anthropomorphization of nature altogether. Founded\
  \ when four rival sects of nature-worshippers witnessed a beautiful natural phenomenon\
  \ and averted destroying each other in a civil war, the Green Faith represents the\
  \ faceless power that fuels much of druidic magic.</p> \n    <p>Not enough? Very\
  \ well...</p> \n    <h2>Chapter 5: Companions and Familiars</h2> \n    <p>What book\
  \ about nature is complete without a bunch of new animal companions? Ultimate Wilderness\
  \ has tons of new options for new animal companions, ranging from the eohippus (an\
  \ early ancestor of the horse) to the marsupial devil to the full-size (read: Large)\
  \ grizzly bear! Be the first to train a saber-toothed cat. Dive deep beneath the\
  \ sea in the belly of your pet anglerfish. Relish the sight of your GM struggling\
  \ to respond when you ask if your paladin's divine mount can be a giant porcupine.\
  \ Speaking of which, page 178 also incorporates a bunch of these new options into\
  \ the cavalier's, paladin's, and ranger's list of available animal companions. Author\
  \ Mikko Kallio did a great job here.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n   \

  \    </div> \n    <p>Animals are great, but what've really captured my attention\
  \ since <em>Ultimate Magic</em> and <em>Advanced Race Guide</em> were the vermin\
  \ and plant companions respectively. At long last, in <em>Ultimate Wilderness</em>,\
  \ I got to write a pile of fun new vermin and plant companions. Some of my favorite\
  \ plants include the creeping puffball, which explodes in Wisdom-damaging poison\
  \ when struck; the gulper plant, which lets you recruit a walking pitcher plant\
  \ as your battle buddy; and the sniper cactus, which can fire its spines at distant\
  \ targets. There's also an array of vermin companions, including the giant mantis\
  \ shrimp, which can make iterative attacks with its pincers; the web tyrant spider,\
  \ which focuses on web-throwing rather than poison; and the giant solifugid, adept\
  \ at pouncing on anything that moves. Want familiars? You can also recruit the suture\
  \ vine, a symbiotic plant that survives on blood but also knits your wounds back\
  \ together as it feeds; the giant tardigrade, an \"immense\" version of the thoroughly\
  \ unkillable micro-organism; and the ravenous tumbleweed, a carnivorous plant that\
  \ attacks by charging into its prey and gains extra speed during windstorms.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>There's so much more in here, from companion and familiar archetypes\
  \ to new animal tricks to new companion feats. There's just not time enough to cover\
  \ it all, so I encourage you to grab a copy of <a href=\"/products/btpy9ujo?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Ultimate-Wilderness\"\
