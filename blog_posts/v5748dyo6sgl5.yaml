  \ \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Hello! My name is Chad Brown, and I'm here to\
  \ talk with you all about the hows, whats, and whys of the Pathfinder Adventure\
  \ Card Game, starting with the new <a href=\"/products/btq01ws7?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Core-Set\"\
  ><em>Core Set</em></a>, and continuing forward to the <a href=\"/products/btq01ws8?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Curse-of-the-Crimson-Throne-Adventure-Path\"\
  ><em>Curse of the Crimson Throne Adventure Path</em></a> and beyond. Today I'm going\
  \ to talk about teamwork: when both the players and the characters work together\
  \ as an effective and exciting adventuring party. Mike's talked about many changes\
  \ for <em>Core</em>, including broad concepts of what we were (and were not) trying\
  \ to accomplish. I'm going to dive in one level deeper and provide some more specifics\
  \ about a couple of those things.</p> \n    <p>There are two major pillars of the\
  \ revision, which I'll call \"Story\" and \"Challenge.\" This probably isn't a surprise;\
  \ the two main areas of feedback we've received since launching <em>Rise of the\
  \ Runelords</em> are various forms of \"we'd like more story\" and \"sometimes,\
  \ the challenge level is off.\"</p> \n    <p>From the story side, we've adjusted\
  \ the game to enhance and encourage teamwork, bringing it to a level you might see\
  \ in an RPG session, adventure novel, comic, or movie. In particular, prior Adventure\
  \ Paths gave groups a lot of freedom over when to split the party and when to group\
  \ up. As a game mechanic, we built a balance around the advantages and disadvantages\
  \ of each, and changed that balance over time, from scenario to scenario. As people\
  \ played more and developed greater mastery over the game system, they came to realize\
  \ that the advantages usually leaned more towards having the group spread out over\
  \ multiple locations. This led to fine gameplay but didn't always match the story\
  \ as much as we might have liked.</p> \n    <p>On a smaller scale, we'd frequently\
  \ see new people learning the game ask how they could help each other, especially\
  \ when their fellows tried something and failed. The answer (some form of \"check\
  \ your character and boon cards\") generally created good gameplay, but often felt\
  \ like a poor match for a heroic adventure story. Simply put, people felt like they\
  \ were playing cool, fun characters, but they didn't always feel like they were\
  \ playing those characters in an adventuring party.</p> \n    <p>To address this,\
  \ we've made some adjustments to how we design cards and scenarios in Core. More\
  \ character powers apply to local characters, and typical boons—including starting\
  \ boons—provide more options for helping characters, especially local characters.\
  \ A few examples:</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6040-EzrenFront.jpg\"\

  ></a> \n     <p>Ezren shows off his knowledge of spellcasting whenever anyone finds\
  \ a scroll or recharges a spell.</p>\n    </div> \n    <p>Further, we've adjusted\
  \ how we make allies and weapons, increasing their teamwork aspects. Allies now\
  \ usually offer some form of help to local characters, giving you more options for\
  \ helping your party. Similarly, more weapons have options to help others in combat,\
  \ both nearby and far away.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6040-Sage.jpg\"\

  ></a> \n     <p>The sage believes the pen is mightier than the sword, but is silent\
  \ on throwing axes.</p>\n    </div> \n    <p>Those of you who've played PACG with\
  \ groups of differing size know that the challenges the game offers to solo and\
  \ two-player groups are often different from those encountered by five- and six-player\
  \ groups. In particular, very small groups tend to feel very little time pressure,\
  \ but individual challenges can be very tough. On the other hand, large groups usually\
  \ have at least one character that is well suited to any particular challenge, so\
  \ the group can bring a lot of help to bear at important moments... but they need\
  \ to accomplish a lot in few turns, especially if they get unlucky at the wrong\
  \ moment. In practice, this could feel almost like two different games: one for\
  \ very small groups and another for very large. Up to a point, this is what we expected\
  \ and wanted; after all, a giant Pathfinder RPG party does and should feel different\
  \ than a solo adventure. As we (including you!) have gained more experience with\
  \ the game, we've come to the conclusion that this split is often larger than we\
  \ (and you) wanted.</p> \n    <p>This gave rise to the biggest rules change since\
  \ <em>Rise of the Runelords</em> first premiered. Because PACG is a cooperative\
  \ game, people naturally want to work together. The rules have previously allowed\
  \ each character to play up to one boon of each type on a given check or step—that\
  \ is, when someone's doing a thing, each player is limited to playing at most one\
  \ card of each type. (For example, to help Lini's combat check, Lem can play either\
  \ his Force Missile spell or his Viper Strike spell, but not both at the same time.)\
  \ This ability to help other people was and is key to the cooperative aspects of\
  \ PACG. Starting with the Core Set, though, we've adjusted that rule so that now\
  \ the party as a whole can play up to one boon of each type:</p> \n    <blockquote>\
  \ \n     <p><i>Each character may play any number of cards, but collectively, the\
  \ party may play no more than one of each type of boon; powers that can be played\
  \ freely do not count toward this limit.</i></p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>I'm\
  \ going to be blunt: many of our playtesters were nervous about this change. When\
  \ you read it in a PDF draft or a playtest forum, it feels like the sort of change\
  \ that could totally change the game, and there were some people who enjoyed the\
  \ \"massive overkill\" situations that the old rule would often create. What we\
  \ found during testing, though, was that it doesn't change the game as often or\
  \ as much as you might think. The major impact it has is to cut down on the situations\
  \ where a group could unload nearly their entire hands at a key moment. What we\
  \ were seeing is that large groups could, with a little planning and effort, reliably\
  \ drop this sort of massive card play on key checks, so much so that they were frequently\
  \ removing the tension from these dramatic points. With this small adjustment to\
  \ the rule, plus the ability to sidestep it when we want to with the freely exception\
  \ (it's used by a LOT of cards), we were able to leave in the option for overkill\
  \ while restoring much of the tension to those key dramatic moments.</p> \n    <p>In\
  \ practical terms, these changes mean that the group will have to coordinate a bit\
  \ more to make optimal use of their resources, and they also bring the typical experience\
  \ of a small group much closer to that of a large group. There are still differences,\
  \ and your group can use some newly provided tools to adjust the effective challenge\
  \ level to match your desires, but the starting points are much closer together.\
  \ We've mentioned before that Core adds several new ways to adjust both the difficulty\
  \ and length of the game, both up and down: wildcards, adjustable size locations,\
  \ more frequent use of scaling effects, and options for adjusting the size of the\
  \ hourglass. You'll find that, in addition to helping everyone have more fun playing\
  \ the game that they want to play, they also help you ensure that your characters\
  \ are adventuring together as a team.</p> \n    <p>The other big thing we added\
  \ to enhance teamwork is a new mechanic: avenge. When introducing the game to people,\
  \ we would sometimes see players go up against a nasty bane of some sort, and then\
  \ stumble due to bad luck, a bad matchup, or simply not being ready to tackle the\
  \ challenge. When this happened, the unfortunate character's friends would invariably\
  \ ask, \"Is there anything I can do?\" Core offers a new answer to that question:\
  \ \"You can try to avenge them.\"</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\

  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6040-CalistriasString_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n     <p>Calistria, goddess of vengeance, approves of this new mechanic.</p>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>When a character fails to defeat a bane, another local character\
  \ may attempt to avenge that encounter. The original character finishes their encounter,\
  \ suffering the normal consequences of failure (including damage), but just before\
  \ the bane in question would go away, the avenging character may bury a card to\
  \ encounter the bane themselves. Sometimes you'll want Merisiel to get rid of that\
  \ trap that chomped on Valeros before it shuffles back in, just so it doesn't chomp\
  \ Val or Kyra later on. When smashing a villain, sometimes Amiri will manage to\
  \ roll a lot of 1s and 2s on her handful of d12s (and not on the same die face!),\
  \ and Seelah will need to step up to try to avoid a painful villain escape.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Each bane can only be avenged once (no stacking; this isn't a video-game\
  \ monster vending machine!), and only by a local character, and by default the avenging\
  \ character must bury a card in order to avenge. So it's something that you'll want\
  \ to work out with your team. But when it works, it can be a beautiful thing indeed.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>This may help you understand why we removed closed locations from the\
  \ game, as Mike mentioned in the previous Core Principles column. This helps tilt\
  \ the game back toward a middle ground between splitting up and staying together.\
  \ Instead of hiding at a closed location when you get in trouble, you can instead\
  \ rely on your friends to help protect you at an active location, using tricks like\
  \ avenge, the new ally and weapon powers, and other changes you'll see as you play\
  \ the game.</p> \n    <p>Before you go, we've got more to share!</p> \n    <blockquote>\
  \ \n     <h2>Bonus Content: Making the Game</h2> \n     <p>As Chad was working on\
  \ this blog, I received this photo from our printer, Cartamundi, showing their \"\
  storyboard\" for assembling the finished game. I thought I'd share it with you,\
  \ giving me the opportunity to guide you on a tour of the <em>Core Set</em>.</p>\
  \ \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20190419-AssemblyStoryboard.jpg\"\
  >\n     </div> \n     <p>Clockwise from top left:</p> \n     <ul>\n      <li>The\
  \ rulebook. Now expanded to 32 pages, and laid out vertically rather than horizontally.</li>\
  \ \n      <li>Token sheets. There are 3 different sheets (they're overlapping in\
  \ the photo), giving you a total of 12 pawns and 63 markers (7 each of 9 different\
  \ designs).</li> \n      <li>The storybook. Its 24 pages present the <em>Dragon's\
  \ Demand</em>: 9 scripted scenarios plus the tools you need to generate a huge variety\
  \ of customized and/or randomized scenarios.</li> \n      <li>The Quick-Start Guide.\
  \ Much like the one in <em>Mummy's Mask</em>, it leads up to 4 characters through\
  \ a shortened version of the first scenario.</li> \n      <li>The box lid.</li>\
  \ \n      <li>4 packs of 110 cards, including the \"Open Me First!\" deck used for\
  \ the Quick-Start scenario.</li> \n      <li>Small components, clockwise from top\
  \ right: foam blocks (4 per game), divider cards (24 per game), dice (d4, d6, d8,\
  \ d10, d12; 1 each), and pawn stands (6 per game).</li> \n      <li>The box bottom,\
  \ packed with cards and small components.</li>\n     </ul> \n     <p>You've probably\
  \ noticed that there's no plastic tray. The tray was great for organizing a single\
  \ Adventure Path that had a fixed number of each type of card, but it didn't work\
  \ quite so well if you sleeved your cards, or if you wanted to add in a few class\
  \ decks. And since the Core Set is intended to be the foundation for any number\
  \ of Adventure Paths, there's going to be a lot less predictability in the card\
  \ mix from here on out. So we've replaced the tray with a much more flexible solution,\
  \ one capable of holding well over 2500 cards, and in a box about two-thirds the\
  \ size of previous Adventure Path boxes. The 24 divider cards will keep your cards\
  \ organized, and the foam blocks will keep them in place.</p> \n     <p>Vic Wertz<br>\
