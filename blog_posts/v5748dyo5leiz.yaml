  > \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">Way back when we first announced <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8mq6\">Heroes &amp; Monsters</a>, the very first <a href=\"/pathfinder/battles\"\
  >Pathfinder Battles</a> prepainted fantasy miniatures set, we knew we needed to\
  \ include Pathfinder goblins from the very start. It’s an open secret that about\
  \ half of that set was already in development at WizKids when we got involved, and\
  \ a lot of the specifically Pathfinder creatures came relatively late in the process.\
  \ Some of the figures, such as the Human Rogue and Orc Brute bear an uncanny resemblance\
  \ to classic Mage Knight figures from the first era of prepainted plastic miniatures,\
  \ whereas others like Seelah and the Ogre were more or less direct ports of Pathfinder\
  \ art to miniature form.</span></p> \n    <p>The Goblin Warrior and Goblin Hero\
  \ figures are examples of miniatures directly inspired by Pathfinder art, but what\
  \ only some of the most astute Pathfinder Battles observers remember is that Heroes\
  \ &amp; Monsters was originally to include a <i>third</i> goblin, the mysterious\
  \ Goblin Mystic.</p> \n    <p>Here’s the weird tale about how that miniature failed\
  \ to happen the first time, and how we finally got a chance to bring him out with\
  \ the upcoming <a href=\"/products/btpy8ww8\">We Be Goblins Builder Series</a> set\
  \ due in stores in late May.</p> \n    <p>The original Goblin Mystic was a port\
  \ from an existing WizKids sculpt, modified slightly so that it better matched the\
  \ Pathfinder goblin art. The original sculpt featured a goblin sitting cross-legged\
  \ on a floating <i>flying carpet</i>. This was problematic because <i>flying carpets</i>\
  \ in Pathfinder are not appropriate treasure for most goblins. Worse, the original\
  \ sculpt was much, much taller than a Pathfinder goblin, so the Goblin Mystic was\
  \ as tall sitting down as our regular goblins were standing up, which wasn’t something\
  \ we could fix without scrapping the entire sculpt.</p> \n    <p>We decided to try\
  \ to make it work anyway, and when we sent WizKids reference art for the only real\
  \ “goblin mystic” that we had—the antagonist goblin druid Vorka from the original\
  \ We Be Goblins! adventure, I’m afraid things went from bad to worse. The original\
  \ sculpt was still way too big, only this time she was wearing a big dumb Gandalf\
  \ hat on top of all the other problems.</p> \n    <p>Ultimately, we decided we couldn’\
  t make things work in time, and that the poor old Goblin Mystic would need to wait\
  \ for a future set.</p> \n    <p>I’m pleased to report that the <a href=\"/products/btpy8ww8\"\
  >We Be Goblins Builder Series</a> set offers us the perfect opportunity to reintroduce\
  \ a “goblin mystic” to the Pathfinder Battles line, only this time without the troublesome\
  \ <i>flying carpet</i> and at the correct scale.</p> \n    <p>And we decided to\
  \ cut through the earlier problems by actually making the goblin mystic Vorka herself,\
  \ rather than a freakishly tall monster simply wearing Vorka’s hat.</p> \n    <p>So\
  \ here she is in all her glory, the goblin villain Vorka!</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130301-Vorka_180.jpeg\" border=\"\

  \ player character adversaries from both the original <a href=\"/products/btpy8j5w\"\
  >We Be Goblins!</a> adventure and Free RPG Day 2013’s <a href=\"/products/btpy8wvm\"\
  >We Be Goblins Too!</a>, the new <a href=\"/products/btpy8ww8\">We Be Goblins Builder\
  \ Series</a> set includes repaints of classic Pathfinder Battles sculpts like this\
  \ major bad boy, the Goblin Warchief!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n  \

  \ src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130301-Warchief_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>This upper-tier goblin villain comes with his very\
  \ own riding lizard and a massive hate-on for the player characters. He’s based\
  \ on the Warchief Ripnugget figure from <a href=\"/products/btpy8rqs\">Rise of the\
  \ Runelords</a>, with a unique new paint scheme.</p> \n    <p>There are two more\
  \ We Be Goblins figures left to preview, but a mix-up here at the office sent them\
  \ to the factory before we had a chance to take good pictures of them.</p> \n  \
  \  <p>Instead, next week we’ll have to content ourselves with preview images of\
  \ jaw-droppers from the very next full set, which we’ll announce here on paizo.com\
  \ early next week!</p> \n    <p>A double dose of Pathfinder Battles news? AMAZING!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>You guys are going to explode when you see the figures from the next\
  \ set.</p> \n    <p>Set your internal spontaneous combustion engines to next week.\
  \ You are all about to go BOOM!</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p>\
