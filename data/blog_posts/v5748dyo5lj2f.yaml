  description\">They’re back for more! The dedicated gamers from the Order of the\
  \ Amber Die have taken on another maddening task with their marathon sessions. They\
  \ tackle an entire Adventure Path adventure in one long session over the course\
  \ of a weekend. What’s better is that they share their experiences with the world.\
  \ After their Giantslayer marathon they took a short break, but were eager to take\
  \ on <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/strangeAeons\">Strange Aeons</a>. Here’\
  s their first report of the Strange Aeons Experiment. (Careful, there may be some\
  \ spoilers within.)</p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <h2>Welcome to The Strange Aeons\
  \ Experiment!</h2> \n      <p>In case you missed our exploits in <a href=\"http://paizo.com/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lhx3?Giantslayer-Marathon-Part-6\"\
  >The Giantslayer Endeavor</a> or <a href=\"http://paizo.com/threads/rzs2rhtg?The-Emerald-Spire-Project#1\"\
  >The Emerald Spire Project</a>, here's a briefing:</p> \n      <p>Order of the Amber\
  \ Die is dedicated to completing published adventures. It's what we do. We don't\
  \ change modules; instead, we put our labors toward bringing them to life as written.\
  \ We enforce the complete Pathfinder rules set, ask no mercy from our GM, and utilize\
  \ four core party members with a 15-point build. We've played through 137 published\
  \ adventures at this point, and while we're looking for something fresh, we're also\
  \ continually looking to push the envelope of gaming. Thus, we are attempting to\
  \ play all six volumes of Strange Aeons in just nine months and document the entire\
  \ journey.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/20160826-Fog.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/20160826-Fog_180.jpeg\"></a> <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20160826-Ambiance.jpg\"\

  \ \n      </div> \n      <p><strong>The Experiment</strong>: What happens when you\
  \ take four players and one GM who are almost completely ignorant about all things\
  \ Lovecraft, Elder Mythos, and Cthulhu and send them through Strange Aeons? We're\
  \ about to find out. In fact, assembling a team of gamers that could marathon often\
  \ and also meet this criteria was much harder than expected! As with almost all\
  \ of our campaigns, we're playing iconic characters; knowing that James Jacobs personally\
  \ selected the four iconics, we decided to play those exact four.</p> \n      <p>A\
  \ long weekend was blocked out for our run of <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy9k5o\">\"\
  In Search of Sanity.\"</a> When we arrived at the marathon location, our GM had\
  \ the fog machines set up and our anticipation grew. To best immerse ourselves in\
  \ an asylum lit by lanterns and candles, we played only by candlelight for the entire\
  \ 44-hour marathon. We also tapped a fifth member for a cameo as Winter Klaczka,\
  \ the main NPC.</p> \n      <p>Going in, our history with Wes Schneider's writing\
  \ was a storied one. He took down one of our favorite campaigns back in '09 when\
  \ we TPKed while attempting <a href=\"/products/btpy7ns8\">\"The Blackguard's Revenge.\"\
  </a> Two years ago, we were a few rooms inside his magma level in the <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8yqx\">Emerald Spire</a>, when Wes took down our paladin with a caustic\
  \ stalker and we barely edged out a draw. This being our third Schneider module,\
  \ we had a strong desire to even-up the score.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurb180\"\

  \ \n      <h2>Highlights From <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy9k5o\">\"In Search of Sanity\"\
  </a></h2> \n      <ul> \n       <li>We're not sure what <a href=\"/store/byCompany/c/chaosium/byProductType/roleplayingGames/callOfCthulhu\"\
  ><em>Call of Cthulhu</em></a> is like, but we found ourselves one part scared, one\
  \ part challenged by combat, and one part just plain freaked out. In a battle for\
  \ a 4,000 sq. ft library, we faced off against ratlings skittering atop towering\
  \ bookcases. On the first two rounds, our starknife, dart, and dagger found their\
  \ marks, disrupting all 3 summon swarms. In this trial the ratlings were modified\
  \ to throw anything, and they certainly threw the books at us.</li> \n       <li>Our\
  \ RPG skills were tested from every angle. Between a doppelganger infiltration,\
  \ the worst dreams our characters have ever had, and six diseases active in the\
  \ party at one time, we were just relieved to survive this cerebral horror film.</li>\
  \ \n       <li>Our GM reflected that being Lovecraft-ignorant was actually fresh\
  \ and inspiring, and he had trouble remembering an adventure with so many new facets.</li>\
  \ \n       <li>In the finale, \"Enter Sandman\" blasted as we faced our worst nightmare-become-reality\
  \ in the Tatterman. Erasmus stepped up with our best chance: <em>Red Destiny</em>,\
  \ a magical sword now treated with <em>silversheen</em> and good-aligned. Not one,\
  \ but two confirmed criticals made short work of a foe that is sure to flay his\
  \ share of parties that come after us.</li> \n       <li>The Amber Die was used\
  \ sparingly, but showed its approval for <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/strangeAeons\"\
  >Strange Aeons</a> by delivering a natural 20 on the first attack roll of the campaign,\
  \ followed by a signature 20-20 in the final hours.</li> \n      </ul> \n      <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20160826-Map.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20160826-Map_180.jpeg\"></a>\
  \ <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20160826-Map3D.jpg\"><img src=\"\
  //static2.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20160826-Map3D_180.jpeg\"></a> \n      </div>\
  \ \n      <h2>Character Deaths</h2> \n      <ul> \n       <li>\"Dr. Latchke,\" a\
  \ crafty doppelganger who got around our Sense Motive, attacked the party from behind\
  \ while they were distracted with a haunt. One critical hit from a claw left Erasmus\
  \ depending on the champion spirit of his sister, Nissa, to guide his fighting retreat—\
  yet the asylum's collapsed walls left the medium no choice but to leave his mortal\
  \ body behind.</li> \n       <li>4 iconics with poor Fortitude saves. 3 Ghouls.\
  \ 9 attacks. 1 missed save. Coup de grace. RIP Quinn.</li> \n      </ul> \n    \
  \  <h2>Best Quote From Marathon 1</h2> \n      <blockquote> <em>Erasmus</em>: \"\
  Ignore the sounds in the fog, my friends, they are fear incarnate.\"\n       <br>\
  \ <em>Feiya</em>: \"I thought we met fear incarnate last night?\" \n      </blockquote>\
  \ \n      <h2>Current Situation</h2> \n      <p>Despite two character deaths, our\
  \ party remains strong and we secured a win. The reanimated medium archetype allowed\
  \ us to welcome Erasmus back, and Quinn's raise dead is first on our to-do list.\
  \ We're doing fairly well on XP, and while our treasury will take a hit, we do have\
  \ some magic items left. We're hoping we can convince Winter Klaczka to join us\
  \ for module two, as she would make an excellent addition to the roster. Oh yeah,\
  \ and Wes: we're tied.</p> \n      <h2>More Content</h2> \n      <p>Read through\
