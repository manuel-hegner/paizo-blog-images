  \ the first volume of the <a href=\"/products/btpy8x8e\">Wrath of the Righteous\
  \ Adventure Path—<i>Pathfinder Adventure Path #73 The Worldwound Incursion</i></a>.\
  \ Since the campaign deals with the denizens of the Abyss, we included stats for\
  \ a demon lord in each volume. In the course of the Adventure Path you'll see stats\
  \ and art for Xoveron, Shax, Sifkesh, Nocticula, Baphomet, and Deskari. Three other\
  \ demon lords get stats in the fall when we release <a href=\"/products/btpy8yop\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4</i></a>. In there you'll see Dagon, Kostchtchie, and\
  \ Pazuzu. To give you a taste of a demon lord's power I've gleaned the following\
  \ list of demon lord traits from a trusted demonologist.</p></span> \n    <blockquote>\

  ></a>\n      <br>Illustration by Helge C. Balzer\n     </div> \n     <h2>Demon Lord\
  \ Traits</h2> \n     <p><b>Demon Lord Traits (Ex, Sp, or Su)</b>: A demon lord is\
  \ a powerful, unique demon that rules a layer of the Abyss. All demon lords are\
  \ chaotic evil outsiders that are, at a minimum, CR 26. Demon lords have a particular\
  \ suite of traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature's entry) as summarized here.</p>\
  \ \n     <ul> \n      <li>A demon lord can grant spells to its worshipers as if\
  \ it were a deity. A demon lord's domains are Chaos, Evil, and two other domains\
  \ relevant to its theme and interests. Like a deity, a demon lord has a favored\
  \ weapon.</li> \n      <li>A demon lord's natural weapons, as well as any weapons\
  \ it wields, are treated as chaotic, epic, and evil for the purpose of overcoming\
  \ damage reduction.</li> \n      <li><i>Abyssal Resurrection (Ex)</i> A demon lord\
  \ rules an Abyssal realm, a vast world that not only serves as its home but provides\
  \ it with power. If a demon lord is slain, its body rapidly melts into corruption\
  \ (leaving behind any gear it held or carried), its soul returns to a hidden location\
  \ within its realm, and it is immediately restored to life (as <i>true resurrection</i>)\
  \ at that location. Once this occurs, a demon lord can't use this ability again\
  \ until a full year has passed. A demon lord realizes it is vulnerable during this\
  \ time and usually doesn't risk further battles for the remainder of that year,\
  \ relying on the defenses of its realm and its legions of minions to protect it.\
  \ A demon lord that is slain again during this year or is killed by unusual methods\
  \ (such as by a true deity or an artifact created for this purpose) is slain forever—\
  its remains appearing somewhere deep in the Abyss among other dead demon lords from\
  \ the ages. A demon lord who does not control a domain does not gain this ability.</li>\
  \ \n      <li><i>Frightful Presence (Su)</i> A demon lord can activate its frightful\
  \ presence as a free action as part of any attack, spell-like ability, special attack,\
  \ or by speaking aloud.</li> \n      <li>Immunity to ability damage, ability drain,\
  \ charm effects, compulsion effects, death effects, energy drain, and petrification.</li>\
  \ \n      <li><i>Regeneration (Ex)</i> Only epic and good damage, or damage from\
  \ a creature of equal or greater power (such as an archdevil, deity, demon lord,\
  \ or protean lord) interrupts a demon lord's regeneration.</li> \n      <li>Resistance\
  \ to acid 30, cold 30, and fire 30.</li> \n      <li><i>Summon Demons (Sp)</i> Three\
  \ times per day as a swift action, a demon lord can summon any demon or combination\
  \ of demons whose total combined CR is 20 or lower. This otherwise works like the\
  \ summon universal monster rule with a 100% chance of success, and counts as a 9th-level\
  \ spell effect.</li> \n      <li>Telepathy 300 feet.</li> \n     </ul> \n     <h2>Abyssal\
  \ Realms</h2> \n     <p>Demon lords' realms range in size, but even the smallest\
  \ are as large as a continent, and the greatest are larger than some planets. The\
  \ realms' environments, themes, and traits are as unique as the demon lords themselves,\
  \ presenting unusual challenges and dangers to creatures trying to explore them.\
  \ Yet despite the close connection a demon lord has to its realm, it does not exert\
  \ total control over the realm, and powerful adventurers can infiltrate such realms\
  \ and accomplish goals without arousing the lord's anger—if they're careful.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>A demon lord gains the following additional powers while in its realm\
  \ (the statistics presented on the following pages do not include these abilities):</p>\
  \ \n     <ul> \n      <li><b>Mythic</b>: A demon lord functions as a 10th mythic\
  \ rank creature, including the mythic power ability (10/day, surge +1d12). It may\
  \ expend uses of mythic power to use the mythic versions of any spell-like ability\
  \ denoted with an asterisk (*) just as if the ability were a mythic spell.</li>\
  \ \n      <li>Use of the following spell-like abilities at will—<i>demand</i>, <i>discern\
  \ location</i>, <i>fabricate</i>, <i>major creation</i>, and <i>polymorph any object</i>\
  \ (when used on objects or creatures that are native to the realm, the polymorph\
  \ duration factor increases by 6).</li> \n      <li>Use of the following spell-like\
  \ abilities once per day—<i>binding</i>, <i>miracle</i> (limited to physical effects\
  \ that manipulate the realm or to effects that are relevant to the demon lord's\
  \ areas of concern)</li> \n      <li><b>Heightened Awareness (Ex)</b>: A demon lord\
  \ gains a +10 insight bonus on Perception checks and Initiative checks.</li> \n\
