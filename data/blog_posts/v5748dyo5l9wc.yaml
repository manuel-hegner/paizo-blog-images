  \ \n    <p class=\"date\">Friday, November 28, 2008</p> \n    <p>Self-plagiarizing\
  \ is just one of many skills I've had to hone and develop after joining Paizo several\
  \ years ago. Now and then, when I was under a deadline crunch for freelance, I'd\
  \ dip into something I'd created for my homebrew campaign over the past 20+ years\
  \ and steal a name or a monster or a spell from those documents, update it to 3rd\
  \ edition, and continue on. When we decided to build an entire new game world to\
  \ support Pathfinder, I did this a lot. Most of Varisia, about half of the world's\
  \ deities, the Red Mantis assassins, Sekamina and Orv, and countless other tidbits\
  \ first saw the light of day in Baria, my homebrew world, one that I've been using\
  \ to run adventures and campaigns for friends and family since fifth grade.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>As you see here, sometimes the things I produced for Baria got a wee-bit\
  \ elaborate for a kid building his own adventures with a brand new electric typewriter\
  \ and a stack of colored pencils, but what can I say? Growing up in the Northern\
  \ California wilderness left me with a lot of free time on my hands. Little could\
  \ I know at the time that I was planting the seeds that would eventually grow into\
  \ the Second Darkness Adventure Path and the elven nation of Kyonin.</p> \n   </blockquote>\

  \ border=\"0\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"9\"></a>  \n   <p><i>The Secret of Deathstalk\
  \ Tower</i> was a pretty straightforward adventure. An evil demon named Treerazer,\
  \ who'd corrupted the elven homeland into a monster-infested forest named Tanglebriar,\
  \ lived in a tower that could transform into an immense golem. This was, of course,\
  \ Deathstalk Tower (although we renamed it the Witchbole in Golarion to match its\
  \ evolution into an enormous evil tree). In the adventure, the PCs had to fight\
  \ their way through Tanglebriar and then climb up the twelve levels of Deathstalk\
  \ Tower to confront Treerazer before he could use his giant golem to crush civilization.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>When I decided to transport Tanglebriar and Treerazer directly into Golarion,\
  \ I knew that eventually I wanted to abuse my position of power here to get Treerazer\
  \ professionally illustrated. The results of that you can see here. Ben Wootten's\
  \ a much better artist than me, but I'm still amused and quite pleased with how\
  \ close the official Treerazer matches up to my early version of him—I didn't send\
  \ this picture to Ben, only described the demon to him in the art order. Seeing\
  \ a childhood creation transform into something like this is a pretty strange experience,\
  \ though.</p> \n   <p>Although Treerazer himself doesn't make an appearance in <a\
  \ href=\"/store/v5748btpy81tr\"><i>Pathfinder</i> #17</a>'s adventure, he does appear\
  \ in the volume's bestiary in all his CR 26 glory. Oh, and one more thing. That\
  \ drow woman getting ready to cast a lightning bolt on the cover of <i>The Secret\
  \ of Deathstalk Tower</i>? That just happens to be the first version of Allevrah,\
  \ the cover girl for <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy84bc\"><i>Pathfinder</i> #18</a>—\
  in the adventure, she's the high-priestess of Treerazer's cult. The orange demon's\
  \ a unique minion of Treerazer's named Lukarazyl (he's now a shemhazian demon but\
  \ still works for Treerazer—see <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy815p\"><i>Pathfinder</i>\
  \ #5</a>, page 87). Only the goofy-looking armored guy hasn't made the transition\
  \ from this old cover to Golarion yet—he was Grotulth, the general of Treerazer's\
  \ armies. Maybe he'll show up someday in a future <i>Pathfinder</i>?</p> \n   <p>James\
