  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Wednesday, August 1, 2007</p> \n   <p>With <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7wiy\"\
  ><i>GameMastery Module W1: Conquest of Bloodsworn Vale</i></a> just about to ship\
  \ out to subscribers, it's time to introduce your PCs to their new home: Fort Thorn.\
  \ This small community is the only bastion of civilization in the Vale and, as such,\
  \ makes for the most likely home base for explorers. The following are descriptions\
  \ of a few key places:</p> \n   <h2>A3. Keep</h2> \n   <p>Aside from the shrine,\
  \ Fort Thorn's keep is the only other stone building in town. This massive two-story\
  \ structure is home to Sir Gyrad Tolgrith (NG male human fighter 4/ranger 2) and\
  \ all of his men. The first floor of the structure contains the meeting hall, armory,\
  \ mess hall, kitchen, and storage rooms. The second floor contains a smaller, private\
  \ meeting hall, the barracks, the planning room, and Sir Tolgrith's private quarters.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Fort Thorn's current staff includes 40 soldiers (LG male human warrior\
  \ 2), 4 scouts (NG male human ranger 2), 2 sergeants (LG male human fighter 4),\
  \ and Sir Tolgrith.</p> \n   <h2>A6. The Boar's Bones</h2> \n   <p>Shortly after\
  \ settling the fort, the soldiers faced their first crisis when the food caravan\
  \ was late and their supplies ran low. Sir Tolgrith sent out his scouts to forage\
  \ and hunt, but after three days they had not found much. On the fourth day they\
  \ scored big, dragging the carcass of an enormous dire boar back into camp at the\
  \ same time the supply caravan finally arrived. During the evening's festivities,\
  \ the boar was picked clean and the fort's cook, Orrend, kept the bones.</p> \n\
  \   <p>A month later, Orrend (CG male halfling expert 3) opened up the Boar's Bones,\
  \ a small inn and tavern, to serve the off-duty soldiers, workers, and visitors\
  \ who happened to stop by. The bones were carefully reconstructed with wire and\
  \ wood, and the now-intact dire boar skeleton sits in the middle of the tavern with\
  \ a pouch hanging from its tusks. Orrend insists that any tips given to the boar\
  \ are sent to its grieving kin.</p> \n   <p>The food at the Boar's Bones is of good\
  \ quality (4 sp per meal), combining local ingredients with caravan supplies. Orrend\
  \ has yet to perfect his rose petal ale, so whenever he has a new batch ready, all\
  \ tankards of it are half price (2 cp). Rooms at the Boar's Bones are simple, with\
  \ only a single cot, washbasin, and cupboard apiece, but clean and free of vermin\
  \ (1 gp per night). </p>\n   <h2>A8. Shrine to Erastil</h2> \n   <p>Every morning,\
  \ the lone bell of this stone shrine tolls twice to start the prayer service. The\
  \ shrine is dedicated to Erastil (LG god of hunting, trade, farming, and family),\
  \ also known as \"Old Deadeye.\" The shrine's lone cleric, Father Apar (LG male\
  \ human cleric 5), tends to the spiritual needs of the community, including healing\
  \ and other minor spellcasting. Father Apar offers these services for free to the\
  \ soldiers, but all others must pay the usual price. Father Apar also has a number\
  \ of divine potions and scrolls for sale, but none worth more than 300 gp.</p> \n\
  \   <p>Father Apar's morning sermons are usually quite calm affairs, with the elderly\
  \ cleric reading from holy scriptures and addressing current concerns. Sir Tolgrith\
  \ makes sure to attend twice per week, but never on a regular schedule. After the\
  \ morning prayers, Father Apar walks around town, talking to the locals about their\
  \ problems or tending to the sick. Once per week, after the day's labor is over,\
  \ Father Apar invites all to an archery challenge in front of the fort. To the winner\
  \ he gifts a potion of his own creation (usually cure light wounds).</p> \n   <p>There\
  \ are, of course, many more places to visit in Fort Thorn, but I'll leave those\
  \ secrets for you to discover.</p> \n   <p>Jason Bulmahn <br>GameMastery Brand Manager</p>\
