  description\">Michael Sayre here, Design Manager for the Pathfinder Rules &amp;\
  \ Lore team, and the lead on the upcoming Pathfinder War of Immortals. I’m chiming\
  \ in to remind you all that we are now a few days past the halfway point of the\
  \ playtest for the new animist and exemplar classes. If you haven’t seen the playtest\
  \ yet, make sure to head to <a href=\"https://paizo.com/pathfinderplaytest\">https://paizo.com/pathfinderplaytest</a>\
  \ and download it now! If you have seen the playtest, head to that same link to\
  \ leave your survey feedback. We’ve already gotten hundreds of responses and we’\
  re very pleased with the positive response. The team has already begun sifting through\
  \ some of your insights in preparation for the next steps, when we continue developing\
  \ these classes after the playtest closes.</p> \n      <p>As normal for these playtests,\
  \ we’ll tell you a bit more about the insights we’ve derived from your feedback\
  \ once the playtest closes. For the sake of keeping that data as strong as possible,\
  \ we don’t want to bias the results by saying too much, too early. There are a couple\
  \ common questions I think we can answer for you now, though.</p> \n      <p><strong>Will\
  \ the animist get more apparitions in the final version? </strong>Absolutely! Right\
  \ now, the apparitions we’ve packaged with the playtest are testing specific dynamics\
  \ of play, with a focus on specific roles we think the animist is likely to fill.\
  \ You can definitely expect to see more apparitions in the final release.</p> \n\
  \      <p><strong>Will the exemplar get more ikons and epithets? </strong>The exemplar\
  \ will definitely see new ikons post-playtest, and the chances of new epithets are\
  \ pretty high, though we’re still sifting through data about the degree to which\
  \ these mechanics are working for folks. The final form that epithets take based\
  \ on your feedback might have some influence on how many are published in the final\
  \ product.</p> \n      <p><strong>What about new feats? </strong>Again, the chances\
  \ are really high. Some of the feats we put out for the playtest were very experimental,\
  \ so it’s possible that you might see some feats go away and other feats take their\
  \ place in the final product. Other feats might have aspects of their level, functionality,\
  \ or other parameters change. Our playtests are playtests, not previews, so while\
  \ there’s often certain elements of what we present that we’re pretty confident\
  \ will stick around in some form for the final version, <em>anything</em> might\
  \ change based on the feedback you give us and the general satisfaction levels our\
  \ players are finding within the playtested classes.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ \n      <br> \n      <p>And that’s about all I’ve got for you, folks! Though,\
  \ maybe…</p> \n      <p>So, sometimes we have more ideas than fit in a book, and\
  \ I’ve certainly had some ideas that I think are fun but unlikely to make it to\
  \ print. The circus-themed apparition below is one such idea, so you tell me, folks:\
  \ on a scale of 1–10, where 1 is “evil circus spirits don’t belong in my game” and\
  \ 10 is “GIMME ALL THE EVIL CLOWNS!!!”, how much do <em>you</em> think something\
  \ like the Reveler in Lost Glee should be in the final product?</p> \n      <blockquote>\
  \ \n       <h3>Reveler in Lost Glee</h3> \n       <p>Revelers in lost glee are twisted\
  \ apparitions that arise in desolate and abandoned places where people once found\
  \ great joy. They find immense mirth in causing harm or discomfort to others and\
  \ don’t enjoy being attuned to animists who fail to laugh at their antics.</p> \n\

  \ 15 feet, trip), <strong>Damage</strong> 6d10+6 slashing; <strong>Ranged</strong>\
  \ [one-action] feast of the lost (acid, range 120 feet, versatile void), <strong>Damage</strong>\
  \ 6d6+6 acid</p> \n      </blockquote> \n      <h3>Apparition Vessel Spell</h3>\
  \ \n      <p>Trickster’s Mirrors [one-action] Focus 1</p> \n      <p>Uncommon, Animist,\
  \ Focus, Illusion, Mental, Visual</p> \n      <p><strong>Defense </strong>basic\
  \ Will</p> \n      <p><strong>Duration</strong> sustained up to 1 minute</p> \n\
  \      <p>You are surrounded by up to 3 mirrors that reflect twisted and distorted\
  \ images of you, making it hard to tell where you actually are within your space\
  \ and potentially causing those who attack you to hit one of the mirrors instead.\
  \ You start with one mirror and gain an additional mirror each time you Sustain\
  \ this spell, up to a maximum of three mirrors. Any attack that would hit you has\
  \ a random chance of hitting one of your mirrors instead of you. With one mirror,\
  \ the chances are 1 in 2 (1–3 on 1d6). With two mirrors, there is a 1 in 3 chance\
  \ of hitting you (1–2 on 1d6). With three mirrors, there is a 1 in 4 chance of hitting\
  \ you (1 on 1d4).</p> \n      <p>Once a mirror is hit, it is destroyed. If an attack\
  \ roll fails to hit your AC but doesn't critically fail, it destroys a mirror. If\
  \ the attacker was within 5 feet, it must succeed at a basic Will save or take 1d4\
  \ mental damage as it believes itself cut by a shower of glass shards from the breaking\
  \ mirror. A damaging effect that affects all targets within your space (such as\
  \ a <em>caustic blast</em>) destroys all of the mirrors.</p> \n      <p><strong>Heightened\
  \ (+1)</strong> The mental damage dealt by a broken mirror increases by 1d4.</p>\
