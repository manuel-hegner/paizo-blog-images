  >Pathfinder Battles: Skull &amp; Shackles</a> is just over the horizon. Already\
  \ you can hear the sea shanties of pirate crews carried on the salt-saturated air,\
  \ and was that a shark fin that passed by just now? We've previewed almost half\
  \ of the 55-figure set so far here on the Paizo Blog, and excitement is building\
  \ for what is shaping up to be one of our best <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids\"\
  >Pathfinder Battles</a> sets yet! Designed to support the popular <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/skullAndShackles\"\
  >Skull &amp; Shackles Adventure Path</a>, the set includes creatures encountered\
  \ in that campaign as well as aquatic and pirate-themed figures usable in any fantasy\
  \ adventure.</span></p> \n    <p>This week I want to show off some of the set's\
  \ stranger figures in the form of three unusual passengers we think will add a lot\
  \ to your sea voyages.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130510-Kroop.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130510-Kroop_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>A long ocean voyage is going to require a lot of food\
  \ to feed the crew, and who better to provide that provender than Ambrose Kroop,\
  \ \"star\" cook to pirates, smugglers, and heroes alike? Over the course of several\
  \ sets, it's our intention to provide all sorts of \"menial\" NPCs, from barkeepers\
  \ to bouncers to barmaids, from watch captains to politicians. When I first saw\
  \ the art for Ambrose Kroop come through during the course of publishing the <a\
  \ href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/skullAndShackles\">Skull &amp; Shackles Adventure\
  \ Path</a> campaign, I just knew I had to include him in a set. Ambrose Kroop is\
  \ an uncommon figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130510-RatSwarm.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130510-RatSwarm_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>And what do you think the \"mystery meat\" is on the\
  \ tenth week at sea? Why, bilge rats, of course! Here we have a Rat Swarm ready\
  \ to eat your feet or feed your belly in case things get desperate. We've put the\
  \ rats on a Small base and made them a common figure so it'll be easy to build up\
  \ enough to have a reasonably sized rat horde.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130510-Gilbrok.jpg\"><img src=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130510-Gilbrok_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>Here we have the menacing Gilbrok the Tongue, a chief lieutenant\
  \ of one of the Adventure Path's key villains. When I saw the illustration for this\
  \ character, I added it to the list for this set as a sort of challenge to our partners\
  \ at WizKids, because I honestly wasn't sure they'd be able to pull off such a complex\
  \ sculpt. You can't quite appreciate all of the detail from the tiny photograph\
  \ above, but you're going to have to trust me that, in terms of complexity, this\
  \ is one of the most elaborate figures we've done to date. He's got a glowing spell\
  \ effect in clear plastic coming off his right hand and a monkey witch familiar\
  \ on his shoulder. His staff is, for lack of a better term, \"very three-dimensional,\"\
  \ and his windswept robes had to be captured just perfectly. He'll work great for\
  \ any crazed hermit, rowdy druid, gross witch, or just plain old weirdo you need\
  \ for your campaigns. That said, we know you won't need a ton of him, which is why\
  \ we made him a rare figure.</p> \n    <p>That's it for this week! Come on back\
  \ next week for a look at three more figures from the <a href=\"/products/btpy8xg6\"\
  >Skull &amp; Shackles</a> set! And if you haven't seen them yet, check out the upcoming\
  \ Pathfinder Battles releases <a href=\"/products/btpy8yj4\">White Dragon Evolution</a>\
  \ and <a href=\"/products/btpy8ww8\">We Be Goblins!</a>, also coming this summer\
  \ from Paizo and WizKids! <a href=\"/products/btpy8o6b\">Set up an ongoing Pathfinder\
  \ Battles subscription</a> today to get discounts on Encounter Packs and make sure\
  \ you don't miss a single figure!</p> \n    <p>Until next week,</p> \n    <p>Erik\
