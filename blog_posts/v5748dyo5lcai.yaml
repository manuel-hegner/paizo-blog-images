  \ Robin D. Laws</p> \n  <h2>Chapter Four: The Beast</h2> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>The\
  \ weirdness of the creature's distant cries washes over the prisoners like a crashing\
  \ wave. The elves have arrayed themselves behind them. With swords outstretched,\
  \ they impel the captives into the newly revealed inner chambers of the Ironroot.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Gad and Vitta are working their way to point position when Dualal chimes:\
  \ \"Not you, good dog. Nor you, halfling. You seem like you might be of more specialized\
  \ use. You two, with the beards—you go first.\"</p> \n   <p>She points a glossy\
  \ nail at the two brothers, Tlivush and Tliuka.</p> \n   <p>Tlivush, the elder one,\
  \ threads his fingers together and begs: \"We are brothers, milady. Let him stay\
  \ back, and I'll bear the brunt of whatever risk—\"</p> \n   <p>\"Human, you should\
  \ know your place by now. As a measure of my vexation, your brother shall walk ahead,\
  \ and you'll hang back.\"</p> \n   <p>The elves hold lanterns for the humans. The\
  \ final Ironroot Vault reveals itself as a succession of twisting tunnels. Every\
  \ surface is wooden, whether covered in bark or exposed and lacquered. Feathery\
  \ roots reach down from the ceiling. Thicker ones provide overhead passage for skittering\
  \ mice.</p> \n   <p>When the vault branches, Tliuka wanders for the closest fork.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"Hold up!\" Vitta shouts.</p> \n   <p>\"What?\" says Dualal.</p> \n \
  \  <p>\"Up in the root structure,\" she says, pointing above Tliuka's head. \"There\
  \ are glowing sigils painted in the roots. A glyph trap.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Go the\
  \ other way,\" Dualal commands.</p> \n   <p>Shoulders hunkered, Tliuka complies.\
  \ </p> \n   <p>\"This isn't right,\" Vitta says to Gad. \"I should be up there,\
  \ not that poor serf.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Got an argument that doesn't explain who you\
  \ are?\" Gad asks.</p> \n   <p>Vitta grimaces. She goes back to checking the ceiling\
  \ and walls as best she can from the back of the shuffling scrum. The passage curves,\
  \ slopes down, and curves again. They come to a set of roots, forming a rough staircase\
  \ leading a dozen steps down. Vitta edges her way to the front of the crowd.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"Let the selected human walk the steps alone,\" calls Dualal.</p> \n\
  \   <p>Tliuka freezes on the first stair.</p> \n   <p>\"Walk lightly, my brother,\"\
  \ Tlivush calls.</p> \n   <p>One by one, Tliuka traverses the steps. He hits bottom\
  \ and moves on down the corridor.</p> \n   <p>A grate of sharpened poles drops from\
  \ the ceiling. It falls with speed and force, knocking Tlivush first to his knees\
  \ and then flat against the floor. The poles impale him. He gasps and writhes. Vitta\
  \ bounds up but there's nothing to be done. </p> \n   <p>\"Tliuka!\" his brother\
  \ cries.</p> \n   <p>Dualal bares her teeth at him. \"Silence, thrall, or we'll\
  \ dig a grave for two!\"</p> \n   <p>Tliuka dies at Vitta's feet.</p> \n   <p>The\
  \ portcullis bars their way. Dualal parts the group to inspect it. She rattles it,\
  \ orders her men to chop at it with swords. It resists their blows.</p> \n   <p>\"\
  Halfling,\" she says, \"you seemed to know to look for traps, before. If you can\
  \ find us a way through this, you'll be rewarded.\"</p> \n   <p>Vitta looks not\
  \ at the portcullis, but at the ceiling and nearby walls.</p> \n   <p>\"Ingenious,\"\
  \ says Vitta, squinting in the lantern light. \"Though woven—or is it grown?—from\
  \ roots, vines, and twigs, it still obeys the rules of winch and pulley. This tough\
  \ fiber here is like the chain, and this notch is where you secure it. The weight-plate\
  \ here, that Tlivush stepped on to trigger it: bark and wood. All of it still living.\
  \ Or, if you prefer, ensorcelled into an eternal semblance of life. And this spiral\
  \ of branches here, that duplicates the actions of a spring. Pulled tight, it imprisons\
  \ a great measure of force. It is that captive force, when suddenly released, that\
  \ made it fall so fast, and impaled poor Tliuka.\"</p> \n   <p>Dualal sucks air\
  \ between her fey-white teeth. \"At another time, halfling, your disquisition might\
  \ be interesting. Can you raise it up, and prevent it from falling?\"</p> \n   <p>\"\
  I could, but will I?\"</p> \n   <p>\"What do you mean?\"</p> \n   <p>\"Will you\
  \ let all of us go, unharmed, when you get what you seek?\"</p> \n   <p>\"You will\
  \ be of little use then.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Yes, that's why I ask.\"</p> \n   <p>\"\
  You'd be wise not to test me.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Do you want this up, or not?\"</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"I swear, you all shall be safely dismissed.\"</p> \n   <p>\"On your\
  \ blood and the blood of your lineage?\"</p> \n   <p>Dualal stiffens. \"Yes, creature.\"\
  \ She gestures to Gad. \"Save for this one. In him I see the potential for longer\
  \ service.\"</p> \n   <p>Gad sees a vituperation form on his comrade's lips.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"Don't worry about me, Vitta,\" he says. \"Accept her pledge, for you\
  \ and for the others.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Give me a boost then,\" she tells him. </p>\
  \ \n   <p>He hoists her up. She hauls at a vine. The wooden grate lifts up, slipping\
  \ wetly free of Tlivush's impaled corpse. The prisoners groan as it rolls into view.\
  \ </p> \n   <p>Vitta rearranges roots, ties a knot around a protruding burl, and\
  \ leaps down to tear chunks of wood from the weight-sensing mechanism.</p> \n  \
  \ <p>\"You have rendered it safe?\" Dualal asks her.</p> \n   <p>Vitta brushes bark\
  \ dust from her palms. \"I have.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Then onward.\"</p> \n   <p></p>\n\

  \ \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>They turn a corner and the howls grow in pitch and frequency.\
  \ Other sounds join its plaintive, angry wails. The unseen thornbeast roars, snorts,\
  \ and slavers. A succession of thumps and frantic scratching noises suggest a creature\
  \ struggling to escape.</p> \n   <p>Gad speeds up, intending to be the first to\
  \ see it. A small cool hand lands on his shoulder, pulling him aside. It's Dualal.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>The creature is within view now. Gad sees it over Dualal's shoulder. It\
  \ is an ever-shifting thing, a mass of muscles, hide, quills, and teeth. It is a\
  \ body arranged entirely around a deep, clashing maw. Its gums are granite; its\
  \ teeth, serrated ivory. Green spittle sprays from its gullet; it reeks of new-mown\
  \ hay. Hundreds of jagged thorns protrude from its back and the outer surfaces of\
  \ its limbs. Blood-red fruits, compounded from bulbous drupes, dangle from its plated\
  \ hide. It is like the frothing, charging issue of an impossible mating: part porcupine,\
  \ part lion, part boulder, part bramble. The thornbeast is growth gone wrong, life\
  \ defined as pure predation.</p> \n   <p>A web of verdant energy forms a seal between\
  \ the passageway and the beast's imprisoning chamber. Seeing Dualal, the thornbeast\
  \ dashes toward it, and is stopped short. It stomps and bucks and froths.</p> \n\
  \   <p>At the very center of the web hangs an opal the size of a fist.</p> \n  \
  \ <p>\"Stand back, all of you,\" she calls, face fixed on the gem.</p> \n   <p>The\
  \ prisoners pell-mell chaotically out of the way. Vitta follows in their wake, though\
  \ more cautiously, alert for traps they failed to trip on the way in. The elves\
  \ step back only a few paces. Gad presses himself into a depression in the wall,\
  \ between two trunklike columns.</p> \n   <p>\"Join me in the chant, good elves!\"\
  \ she cries. Together they draw their arms away from their bodies, hands twisted\
  \ into arcane shapes. She leads the ritual. An ancient, breathy ululation sings\
  \ from her lungs. Her retinue joins her, harmonizing. The green, imprisoning web\
  \ flickers.</p> \n   <p>The thornbeast grows still, as if calmed by elfsong. Meekly,\
  \ it retreats to the far corner of its cell.</p> \n   <p>Dualal plucks the opal\
  \ from the air.</p> \n   <p>The web vanishes.</p> \n   <p>The creature blinks. It\
  \ realizes that it is free.</p> \n   <p>Gad's throat constricts.</p> \n   <p>The\
  \ creature opens its own, shrilling out its bloodthirsty anticipation.</p> \n  \
  \ <p>Dualal reaches into her pack for her wand, readying herself to kill the thornbeast,\
  \ just as she did its lesser cousin, back in the forest.</p> \n   <p>Gad steps from\
  \ the alcove.</p> \n   <p>\"Get back!\" Dualal shrieks.</p> \n   <p>Gad reaches\
  \ for her.</p> \n   <p>She clutches the opal tight. \"You've come to steal the gem!\"\
  \ she realizes.</p> \n   <p>\"No,\" Gad corrects. \"I've come to steal this.\" He\
  \ snatches the wand from her hand.</p> \n   <p>The amber elf leaps at him. Ready\
  \ for his lunge, Gad pivots, throwing him. He lands at the thornbeast's clawed,\
  \ titanic feet.</p> \n   <p>Dualal's elven retinue draws swords. Gad gets out of\
  \ their way by pushing Dualal into a wall. The warriors rush to engage the thornbeast.\
  \ It already has Amberelf's right leg caught tight in its jaws. It ragdolls him\
  \ back and forth, dashing his skull against the hard wooden wall of its cell.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Dualal stutters her incomprehension. \"The wand? I need that to quell\
  \ the beast.\"</p> \n   <p>\"I'm not sure it'll work on that thing, and, more to\
  \ the point, don't care,\" Gad says.</p> \n   <p>She struggles to get at her sword\
  \ hilt but it's wedged between her back and the wall. </p> \n   <p>\"The wand?\"\
  \ she continues. \"You came to steal the wand?\"</p> \n   <p>With deft fingers Gad\
  \ unbuckles her scabbard. \"Yep.\" </p> \n   <p>\"The wand. Not the gem?\"</p> \n\
  \   <p>\"Nope.\" Buckles loosened, he pulls the entire apparatus—sword, scabbard,\
  \ and belt—from her.</p> \n   <p>\"But it's priceless! Invaluable beyond measure!\"\
  </p> \n   <p>\"Maybe to your insane dreams of conquest. But I don't know where I'd\
  \ fence that. Whereas this remarkable wand of yours, unique on Golarion as far as\
  \ I can tell —why, I have a buyer in Nerosyan lined up to pay a hundred thousand\
  \ on the spot.\"</p> \n   <p>Behind them, the thornbeast devours Dualal's men. It\
  \ crunches through bone and snaps off limbs. </p> \n   <p>Blinded by fury, Dualal\
  \ scarcely notices. \"You have betrayed me,\" she hisses.</p> \n   <p>\"You enslaved\
  \ me first, so it all comes out in the wash.\"</p> \n   <p>He pushes away from her,\
  \ sword in one hand, wand in the other. She tries to pull her dagger. It stays stuck\
  \ in its sheath. She withdraws her hand, pulling threads of glue with it. </p> \n\
  \   <p>\"You remember the glue trap, back there?\" Gad says. \"Vitta saved some\
  \ for you.\"</p> \n   <p>\"The two of you... confederates?\"</p> \n   <p>\"Elves\
  \ aren't the only ones who plan ahead.\"</p> \n   <p>\"But—but you are my dog!\"\
  </p> \n   <p>\"Ruff ruff,\" he says, backing up.</p> \n   <p>Once around the corner,\
  \ he turns and sprints. An ill-cast spell whizzes overhead, scorching vine leaves,\
  \ singeing his hair. He turns to point the death wand back at Dualal, having no\
  \ idea what it might do to an elf rather than a thornbeast. She stops, flattening\
  \ herself against a wall. He scuttles back to the preplanned point.</p> \n   <p>He\
  \ nods to Vitta. Her expression fuses mock innocence with self-satisfied serenity.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>She slashes a vine. The portcullis slams down, leaving Gad and Vitta and\
  \ the press gang on one side, the elves stuck with the thornbeast on the other.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"Better go,\" he tells Vitta. \"She still has spells.\"</p> \n   <p>\"\
  I forgot to mention,\" the halfling says, \"the portcullis coated with some kind\
  \ of magic retardant. Impervious to spells.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Forgot to mention?\"\
  </p> \n   <p>\"A randomly captured thrall can't seem too knowledgeable,\" she says.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>The sounds of carnage flow down the passageway as the thornbeast finishes\
  \ off Dualal's retainers.</p> \n   <p>Dualal surges to the wooden portcullis, jutting\
  \ her pale fingers through it. Ignoring Gad, she pleads her case to Vitta: \"Let\
  \ this up! Quick! The creature's coming!\"</p> \n   <p>Vitta puts hands on hips.\
  \ \"It'll hold. For awhile.\"</p> \n   <p>\"But I promised you a safe dismissal!\"\
  </p> \n   <p>\"Our freedom was never yours to grant.\"</p> \n   <p>Dualal looks\
  \ back with terror as the ripping and tearing sounds subside. \"This is not in the\
  \ prophecy!\"</p> \n   <p>\"I can't help you with that one,\" Gad says.</p> \n \
  \  <p>\"But the thornbeast—it will run a-feasting through the Shudderwood, and perhaps\
  \ beyond!\"</p> \n   <p>\"Three minutes ago,\" he says, turning his back on her,\
  \ \"that was a price you were willing to pay.\"</p> \n   <p>They are well into in\
  \ the excavated passageway when they hear the beast pounce, all grunts and scrabbling\
  \ claws. To her credit, Dualal barely looses a scream.</p> \n   <p>They surface\
  \ expecting to find the prisoners waiting for them, seeking guidance back to civilized\
  \ parts. Instead, the freed thralls are already gone. </p> \n   <p>\"Hnh,\" Vitta\
  \ says. \"They didn't trust us.\"</p> \n   <p>\"In fairness,\" says Gad, \"no one\
  \ ever should.\"</p> \n   <p>Vitta nods her agreement. Without further repartee,\
  \ they set out for Nerosyan, and the hundred thousand that awaits them there.</p>\
