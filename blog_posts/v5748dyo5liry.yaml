  >Working on <a href=\"/products/btpy9l37\"><em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Inner\
  \ Sea Intrigue</em></a> brought out our inner deviousness—this book has so many\
  \ ways to inject a little craftiness into your Golarion games, especially for players\
  \ and GMs who are using the recently released <a href=\"/products/btpy9j6p\"><em>Ultimate\
  \ Intrigue</em></a>. Now that <a href=\"/products/btpy9l37\"><em>Inner Sea Intrigue</em></a>\
  \ is about to hit the streets, we thought we’d show you some of our favorite toys\
  \ from the book!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb180\" style=\"float: left;\">\n   \

  /products/btpy9l37\"><em>Inner Sea Intrigue</em></a> riffs seamlessly off of <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy9j6p\"><em>Ultimate Intrigue</em></a> in that much of its\
  \ content showcases these new rules as they affect and exist in Golarion. One of\
  \ many examples is the specific archives presented. Using the research rules found\
  \ on pages 148–153 of <a href=\"/products/btpy9j6p\"><em>Ultimate Intrigue</em></a>,\
  \ the book presents four places of research that feature prominently in the setting.\
  \ They are Forae Logos, located in the Wise Quarter in Absalom; the Jeggare Museum,\
  \ located in Korvosa in Varisia; the Magaambya, located in Nantambu in the Mwangi\
  \ Expanse; and the Quarterfaux Archives, located in Caliphas in Ustalav.</p> \n\

  ></a>\n     <br> <em>Illustration by Konstantin Vavilov</em>\n    </div> \n    <p>By\
  \ making Research checks and reducing the archives’ knowledge points, players can\
  \ discover many of the fascinating truths kept in these libraries. Many such discoveries\
  \ are in-world details that pertain to the history of the archives’ locations, the\
  \ magic that has thrived there, and other key elements. Some of the most difficult-to-unearth\
  \ discoveries, though, are adventure seeds in and of themselves.</p> \n    <p>Take\
  \ this gem, found in the depths of the Jeggare Museum, for example. </p>\n    <blockquote>\n\
  \     \"A small island in Lake Skotha on the Storval Plateau is known as Chorak’\
  s Tomb, and is rumored to be the home of an ancient weapon that belonged to a runelord\
  \ rival of Karzoug. However, no one has been able to get close enough to verify\
  \ this story, as all trespassers are driven away by bombardments of boulders and\
  \ rune-covered ballista bolts.\"\n    </blockquote> \n    <p></p> \n    <p>As with\
  \ other \"Inner Sea\" hardcover tie-ins we’ve done in the past (including <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8mfs\"><em>Inner Sea Magic</em></a> and <a href=\"/products/btpy95b1\"\
  ><em>Inner Sea Combat</em></a>), we also had the opportunity to present dozens of\
  \ new character options, from new talents for investigators, rogues, and vigilantes,\
  \ to new archetypes and prestige classes directly tied to the intriguing elements\
  \ of the Inner Sea region. The prestige classes included are the Lion Blade of Taldor\
  \ (updated from its 3.5 iteration) and the enchanting courtesan (inspired by the\
  \ character Vreva Jhafae in the <a href=\"/pathfinder/tales\">Pathfinder Tales</a>\
  \ novel <a href=\"/products/btpy9aon\">\"Pirate’s Promise\"</a>), while the new\
  \ archetypes include the Anaphexia thought-killer, the bonded investigator (who\
  \ gets a familiar to aid him in his research), the Nexian spell-spy, the tinkerer\
  \ (who learns to craft a clockwork familiar that she can adapt to an increasing\
  \ number of situations as she levels up), and many more!</p> \n    <p>Whether you’\
  re a GM running a campaign with intriguing elements, or a player whose PC prides\
  \ herself on her sneaky, duplicitous ways, there’s no better supplement to an Inner\
  \ Sea campaign than <a href=\"/products/btpy9l37\"><em>Inner Sea Intrigue</em></a>!</p>\
