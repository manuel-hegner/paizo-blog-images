  > \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">We launched <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety\">Pathfinder\
  \ Society Roleplaying Guild's</a> Season of the Stolen Storm with the promise of\
  \ exploring the elemental planes, yet so far, the season has maintained a conspicuously\
  \ Material Plane focus. Part of that's a lesson learned from Season 6, whose two\
  \ dozen scenarios incorporated advanced technology in modest quantities yet developed\
  \ a nothing-but-tech reputation because many of those scenarios debuted near the\
  \ beginning of the season. This year we've been ramping up our extraplanar storyline\
  \ more gradually, including <a href=\"/products/btpy9mbd\"><em>Pathfinder Society\
  \ Special #7-99: Through Maelstrom Rift</em></a> as a peek behind the scenes of\
  \ developments on their way and <a href=\"/products/btpy9oii\"><em>Pathfinder Society\
  \ Scenario #8-05: Ungrounded but Unbroken</em></a> as the Society's first on-screen\
  \ step onto the elemental planes. At the same time, we've provided an oft-requested\
  \ return to Galt, a story of redemption in Dtang Ma, an evergreen Tier 3-7 scenario,\
  \ and more.</p> \n    <p>But make no mistake: we'll be seeing more of the elemental\
  \ planes. That begins this week, beginning with two short series: Tyranny of Winds\
  \ and Forged in Flame!</p> \n    <p>The first installment of Tyranny of Winds comes\
  \ to us from Charlie Brooks, who takes us on a whirlwind tour of Osirion's Scorpion\
  \ Coast in <a href=\"/products/btpy9p8v\"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-08:\
  \ Tyranny of Winds, Part 1: The Sandstorm Prophecy</em></a>, a Tier 1-5 adventure.\
  \ Much to Venture-Captain Norden Balentiir's consternation, his lodge has suffered\
  \ another theft, this time apparently in association with the Society's recent acquisition\
  \ of a powerful elemental artifact. The culprit has escaped into the Scorpion Coast,\
  \ an untamed wilderness that Osirian pharaohs once attempted to settle through the\
  \ labor of elementals—no doubt of interest to members of the Scarab Sages. It is\
  \ now the domain of free-willed elementals that view most humanoids as trespassers,\
  \ and it's here the PCs must travel if they are to find where the thief fled.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>This season it's a goal of ours to present at least two adventures in\
  \ each of the four elemental planes, and the Plane of Fire has proven one of the\
  \ greatest challenges because, well, PCs are remarkably combustible in a realm that\
  \ deals 3d10 fire damage each round. The answer was to look to the great trade cities,\
  \ which offer some protection from the heat. The City of Brass is the most famous\
  \ of these (and is on the way), but what really jumped out at us was Zjarra, a cosmopolitan\
  \ refuge that attracts commerce from across the multiverse. Not only is this appealing\
  \ to the Exchange faction, but Zjarra is also the home of a dangerous informant\
  \ who has offered her expertise in solving one of the Society's pressing problems—\
  for a price. Venture-Captain Esmayl Ibn Qaradi has given the PCs the first crack\
  \ at negotiating this planar metropolis in <a href=\"/products/btpy9p8w\"><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Society Scenario #8-09: Forged in Flame, Part 1: The Cindersworn Pact</em></a>,\
