  \  <blockquote> \n     <h2>OPA Musings</h2> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Recently,\
  \ I foolishly declared that because a couple of our major conventions were delayed,\
  \ this summer wouldn’t be as bad on the convention front. I retract this statement!\
  \ We’ve got PAX Online this month, PaizoCon Europe Online next month, and Gen Con\
  \ after that. Oh, and after that is my wedding. So much for my relaxing summer!</p>\

  \ and Mark Molnar</p>\n     </div> \n     <br> \n     <h2>Title Changes</h2> \n\
  \     <p>We’ve been shuffling around some job titles and responsibilities on the\
  \ Organized Play development team over the last few weeks to account for the transfer\
  \ of the Pathfinder and Starfinder One-Shots product lines to this team. To reflect\
  \ this shift, we’re going to start calling the team the “Digital Adventures Team,”\
  \ rather than a title more closely associated with our OP programs, as their creative\
  \ remit now covers items that aren’t directly related to our Organized Play campaigns.\
  \ (They'll still handle those products as well, just alongside these new items on\
  \ their docket.)</p> \n     <ul> \n      <li>Linda Zayas-Palmer is now the Development\
  \ Manager (Digital Adventures) and manages the Digital Adventures Team, of which\
  \ the “Organized Play Team” is a subset.</li> \n      <li>Thurston Hillman is now\
  \ titled Developer (Digital Adventures), and will be focusing on Paizo’s One-Shots,\
  \ Bounties, and Society Interactives.</li> \n      <li>Jenny Jarzabski is the Starfinder\
  \ Society Developer, and Mike Kimmel is the Pathfinder Society Developer, though\
  \ both share the official title of Organized Play Line Developer. Jenny and Mike\
  \ are running the day-to-day development of Starfinder Society and Pathfinder Society,\
  \ respectively.</li> \n     </ul> \n     <p>Most of this is just bringing job titles\
  \ in line with the developers’ day-to-day duties, but we wanted to announce them\
  \ in case anybody noticed the changes in the masthead of new scenarios.</p> \n \
  \    <h2>Starfinder Society Year 4</h2> \n     <p>We’ve got a couple points of clarification\
  \ with information we’ve released about Starfinder Society Year 4. In addition,\
  \ we wanted to post an update that we’re currently working on compiling the common\
  \ questions about the shift away from Fame and will have answers to some of the\
  \ outstanding issues and boons prior to the Fame spending deadline. </p> \n    \
  \ <h4><em>Table Size</em></h4> \n     <p>It was brought to our attention that there\
  \ was an additional rule change with Year 4 of Starfinder Society that didn’t get\
  \ the spotlight it should’ve. As of the beginning of Year 4, <a href=\"https://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/Lorespire/sfsguide._.Player-Basics#Legal_Table_Size\"\
  >the maximum player count for a table is <b>six players</b></a>. Seven-player tables\
  \ are no longer permitted. We didn’t intend to sneak this change by anybody, we\
  \ just forgot to announce it with the rest of the changes! </p> \n     <h4><em>New\
  \ Ships</em></h4> We have one final piece of business to attend to with our new\
  \ year of Starfinder Society, and that’s the Azata! This brand new ship is available\
  \ to all players, and its statistics are now available <a href=\"https://organizedplayfoundation.org/Lorespire/sfsguide._.Starships\"\
  >in the Starfinder Society Guide</a>.\n     <p></p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \     <h2>Pathfinder Society Year 3</h2> \n     <p>Last month, we announced the\
  \ title for Pathfinder Society <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shpa\"\
  >Year 3: the Year of Shattered Sanctuaries</a>. We’re excited for you all to experience\
  \ this new storyline; from what I’ve read so far, it’ll be a great year for veteran\
  \ and brand-new players alike. One of the highlights for new players is the three-part\
  \ introduction arc we talked about in the Paizo Intro Blog last Thursday. Mike Kimmel\
  \ did <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOOklXtBOsw\">an interview with\
  \ the Danger Club Podcast</a>—go check it out for some more teasers, and stay tuned\
  \ to the blog for more news!</p> \n     <h2>Sanctioning</h2> \n     <p>The big headline\
  \ for this month’s sanctioning update is for our First Edition players! We’re pleased\
  \ to announce that updated versions of the PFS (first edition) <a href=\"https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/additional\"\
  >Additional Resources</a> and <a href=\"https://paizo.com/pathfinderSociety/clarifications\"\
  >Campaign Clarifications</a> have been released and take effect immediately. We\
  \ anticipate that this will be the final version of these documents, barring any\
  \ major issues. We’re still working on sanctioning documents for the final Adventure\
  \ Paths, but their rules options are all factored into this update. </p> \n    \
  \ <p>I don’t have as much to report for our active programs this month. For Pathfinder\
  \ Society, sanctioning documents for the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/fistsOfTheRubyPhoenix\"\
  ><em>Fists of the Ruby Phoenix</em> Adventure Path</a> and <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq024xn\"\
  ><em>Malevolence</em></a> are both ready to go live when the books are released\
  \ on July 7th. Next on the list for PFS is <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq027ot?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-The-Mwangi-Expanse\"\
  ><em>Lost Omens The Mwangi Expanse</em></a> and the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/strengthOfThousands\"\
  ><em>Strength of Thousands</em> Adventure Path</a>. For Starfinder Society, I’m\
  \ pleased to announce that the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/starfindersociety/characteroptions\"\
  >Character Options page</a> has been updated to include the options in the <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/products/btq024zu?Starfinder-Galaxy-Exploration-Manual\">Galaxy\
  \ Exploration Manual</a>. We weren’t able to get Fly Free or Die or Devastation\
  \ Ark’s character options out this month, but we’re working on those as our next\
  \ priority.</p> \n     <h2>GM Recognition</h2> \n     <p>Whether stars, novas, or\
  \ glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial amount of\
  \ time. To achieve the 5th milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least\
  \ 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios, as well as run between one\
  \ and three games for venture-captains (program dependent). A conservative estimate\
  \ of the time needed to reach the 5th milestone is 650 hours!</p> \n     <p>This\
  \ month, we have several GMs to recognize!</p> \n     <p><b>5th Star</b>: Filipp\
  \ Kovalev, Lindsey Long<br> <b>5th Nova</b>: Michael Beck, James Carter, Rebecca\
  \ Fehn</p> \n     <p>Congratulations to our GMs, and thank you for your dedication!\
  \ If you believe you have achieved your 5th rank but haven’t been announced, email\
  \ us at <a href=\"mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com\">organizedplay@paizo.com</a>.</p>\
  \ \n     <h2>Upcoming Conventions</h2> \n     <p>Remember that you can use the <a\
  \ href=\"https://paizo.com/conventions\">new Conventions calendar</a> to check out\
  \ all the upcoming conventions with a Paizo Organized Play presence! I also wanted\
  \ to republish the information for all our major shows here so it’s all in one place.</p>\
