  \ case you missed it, a few weeks ago the Pathfinder design team previewed some\
  \ changes we were considering making to the Stealth skill. Like any design endeavor,\
  \ game design benefits from iteration. After letting all of you playtest the rules\
  \ and let us know what you thought of the first draft, we went back to the drawing\
  \ board and made some changes based on that fantastic feedback.<br> In this round\
  \ of playtesting, you'll find that we've cleared up some action issues. We have\
  \ opened up the possibilities for using standard actions with the Stealth skill,\
  \ as long as those standard actions do not attack creatures. In this way, the Stealth\
  \ skill mirrors the rules found in the <i>invisibility</i> spell; at least as far\
  \ as what actions you can attempt while you are hidden without automatically ending\
  \ that condition.</p> \n   <p>Speaking of hidden, while we have kept the invisible\
  \ condition, and have even strengthened the wording on that condition a bit, we\
  \ have also created a lesser, connected condition called hidden. You gain the hidden\
  \ condition when you benefit from Stealth, and you gain the invisible condition\
  \ when you use a spell or effect that makes you visually undetectable, like the\
  \ <i>invisibility</i> spell. Hidden is the base condition, and invisible is an upgrade\
  \ of that condition.</p> \n   <p>Lastly, we have added some small language changes\
  \ to explain how the hidden condition interacts with some universal monster rules\
  \ dealing with senses—specifically blindsense, blindsight, scent, and tremorsense.<br>\
  \ Just like the last round of playtesting, keep in mind that these changes are not\
  \ yet official. While you are free to use them in your home game—and we would like\
  \ you to do so—these changes are not yet ready for Pathfinder Society play. This\
  \ time around we are going to give you two weeks to playtest and comment on these\
  \ proposed changes, so tell us what you think sometime before October 3rd. We'll\
  \ announce the final version in the Design Tuesday blog sometime after the playtest\
  \ is completed, and make changes to the rules using the Pathfinder RPG FAQ system.</p>\
  \ \n   <h2>Stealth</h2> \n   <p><b>(Dex; Armor Check Penalty)</b> You are skilled\
  \ at avoiding detection, allowing you to slip past foes or strike from an unseen\
  \ position. This skill covers hiding and moving silently.</p> \n   <p><b>Check:</b>\
  \ Your Stealth check is opposed by the Perception check of anyone who might notice\
  \ you. Usually a Stealth check is made at the start of an action when you have some\
  \ kind of cover (except for soft cover) or concealment. You cannot spend a free\
  \ action to initiate Stealth, but if you spend a free action while under the effects\
  \ of Stealth, you must make a new Stealth check to continue its effects. You can\
  \ always spend a swift action to stay immobile and make a Stealth check. You can\
  \ move up to half your speed and use Stealth at no penalty. When moving at a speed\
  \ greater than half your speed and up to your normal speed, you take a –5 penalty\
  \ on the Stealth check. It's usually impossible to use Stealth while taking an immediate\
  \ action, a full-round action, or any action to make an attack, unless you are subject\
  \ to <i>greater invisibility</i> or a similar effect, or you are sniping (see below).\
  \ When you make your Stealth check, those creatures that didn't succeed at the opposed\
  \ roll treat you as hidden until the start of your next action or until the end\
  \ of your turn if you do not end your turn with cover or concealment. You are not\
  \ hidden from creatures that are observing you (creatures that you didn't have cover\
  \ or concealment from) or that succeed at the opposed check.<br> A creature larger\
  \ or smaller than Medium takes a size bonus or penalty on Stealth checks depending\
  \ on its size category: Fine +16, Diminutive +12, Tiny +8, Small +4, Large –4, Huge\
  \ –8, Gargantuan –12, Colossal –16.</p> \n   <p><b>Attacking while Hidden:</b> Usually,\
  \ making an attack against a creature ends the hidden condition. For purposes of\
  \ Stealth, an attack includes any spell targeting a foe or whose area or effect\
  \ includes a foe. Actions directed at an unattended object do not end Stealth. Causing\
  \ harm indirectly is not an attack. If during your last action you were hidden to\
  \ a creature, you are still considered hidden when you make the first attack of\
  \ that new action.</p> \n   <p><b>Other Perception Checks:</b> If a creature makes\
  \ a Perception check as a move action to notice a hidden creature, the DC of the\
  \ Perception check is the hidden creature's last Stealth check. This is also the\
  \ case if a creature makes a Perception check to notice a hidden creature because\
  \ the perceiving creature is entering an area where it could possibly notice a hidden\
  \ creature.</p> \n   <p><b>Sniping:</b> If you already are hidden to a target and\
  \ you are at least 10 feet away from that target, as a standard action, you can\
  \ make one ranged attack against that target and immediately make an opposed Stealth\
  \ check to stay hidden. You take a –20 penalty on your Stealth check when attempting\
  \ to snipe.</p> \n   <p><b>Creating a Diversion to Hide:</b> You can use Bluff to\
  \ allow you to use Stealth. If you do not have cover or concealment, as a swift\
  \ action, you can attempt a Bluff check opposed by the Sense Motive of opponents\
  \ that can see you. If you are successful, you are considered to have concealment\
  \ from those creatures (but you do not gain the percent miss chance from concealment)\
  \ until the end of your next action, you make an attack (as defined in the Attacking\
  \ while Hidden section, above), or the end of your turn, whichever happens first.</p>\
  \ \n   <p><b>Action:</b> Usually making a Stealth check is not an action. Using\
  \ Stealth is part of the action you are taking.</p> \n   <p><b>Special:</b> If you\
  \ are subject to the <i>invisibility</i> or <i>greater invisibility</i> spells or\
  \ a similar effect, you gain a +40 bonus on Stealth checks while you are immobile,\
  \ or a +20 bonus on Stealth checks while you're moving. If you have the Stealthy\
  \ feat, you get a bonus on Stealth checks (see Chapter 5).</p> \n   <h2>Conditions</h2>\
  \ \n   <p><b>Hidden:</b> You are difficult to detect but you not invisible. A hidden\
  \ creature gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls against sighted opponents, and ignores\
  \ its opponents' Dexterity bonus to AC (if any). You do not have line of sight to\
  \ a creature or object that is hidden from you.</p> \n   <p><b>Invisible:</b> Invisible\
  \ creatures are visually undetectable. An invisible creature or object gains the\
  \ benefits of the hidden condition. An invisible object or creature gains total\
  \ concealment.</p> \n   <h2>Universal Monster Rules</h2> \n   <p><b>Blindsense (Ex)</b>\
  \ Using nonvisual senses, such as acute smell or hearing, a creature with blindsense\
  \ notices things it cannot see. The creature usually does not need to make Perception\
  \ checks notice hidden creatures or to pinpoint the location of an invisible creature\
  \ within range of its blindsense ability, provided that it has line of effect to\
  \ that creature. Any opponent the creature cannot see still has total concealment\
  \ from the creature with blindsense, and the creature still has the normal miss\
  \ chance when attacking foes that have concealment. Visibility still affects the\
  \ movement of a creature with blindsense. A creature with blindsense is still denied\
  \ its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class against attacks from creatures it cannot see.<br>\
  \ <i>Format:</i> blindsense 60 ft.; <i>Location:</i> Senses.</p> \n   <p><b>Blindsight\
  \ (Ex)</b> This ability is similar to blindsense, but is far more discerning. Using\
  \ nonvisual senses, such as sensitivity to vibrations, keen smell, acute hearing,\
  \ or echolocation, a creature with blindsight maneuvers and fights as well as a\
  \ sighted creature. <i>invisibility</i>, darkness, and most kinds of concealment\
  \ are irrelevant, as is the hidden condition, though the creature must have line\
  \ of effect to a creature or object to discern that creature or object. The ability's\
  \ range is specified in the creature's descriptive text. The creature usually does\
  \ not need to make Perception checks to notice creatures within this range. Unless\
  \ noted otherwise, blindsight is continuous, and the creature need do nothing to\
  \ use it. Some forms of blindsight, however, must be triggered as a free action.\
  \ If so, this is noted in the creature's description. If a creature must trigger\
  \ its blindsight ability, the creature gains the benefits of blindsight only during\
  \ its turn.<br> <i>Format:</i> blindsight 60 ft.; <i>Location:</i> Senses.</p> \n\
  \   <p><b>Scent (Ex)</b> This special quality allows a creature to detect approaching\
  \ enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell. Creatures with the\
  \ scent ability can identify familiar odors just as humans do familiar sights.<br>\
  \ The creature can detect opponents within 30 feet by sense of smell. If the opponent\
  \ is upwind, the range increases to 60 feet; if downwind, it drops to 15 feet. Strong\
  \ scents, such as smoke or rotting garbage, can be detected at twice the ranges\
  \ noted above. Overpowering scents, such as skunk musk or troglodyte stench, can\
  \ be detected at triple normal range.<br> When a creature detects a scent, the exact\
  \ location of the source is not revealed—only its presence somewhere within range.\
  \ The creature can take a move action to note the direction of the scent. When it\
  \ is within 5 feet of the source, the creature pinpoints the source's location or\
  \ notices a hidden creature.<br> A creature with the scent ability can follow tracks\
  \ by smell, making a Wisdom (or Survival) check to find or follow a track. The typical\
  \ DC for a fresh trail is 10 (no matter what kind of surface holds the scent). This\
  \ DC increases or decreases depending on how strong the quarry's odor is, the number\
  \ of creatures, and the age of the trail. For each hour that the trail is cold,\
  \ the DC increases by 2. The ability otherwise follows the rules for the Survival\
  \ skill. Creatures tracking by scent ignore the effects of surface conditions and\
  \ poor visibility.<br> <i>Format:</i> scent; <i>Location:</i> Senses.</p> \n   <p><b>Tremorsense\
  \ (Ex)</b> A creature with tremorsense is sensitive to vibrations in the ground\
  \ and can automatically notice hidden creatures and objects as well as pinpoint\
  \ invisible creatures and objects in contact with the ground. Aquatic creatures\
  \ with tremorsense can also sense the location of creatures moving through water.\
  \ The ability's range is specified in the creature's descriptive text.<br> <i>Format:</i>\
  \ tremorsense 60 ft.; <i>Location:</i> Senses.</p> \n   <p>Stephen Radney-MacFarland<br>\
