  \ </div> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Over the past 2 weeks, we've tried to\
  \ give you a sense of what Pathfinder Second Edition is all about, but now it's\
  \ time to delve into some details on the classes. From now until the game releases\
  \ in August, we'll go through the classes one by one, pausing now and then to look\
  \ at various rules and systems. Today, let's take a look at one of the most foundational\
  \ classes in the game: the fighter.</p> \n     <p>The fighter was one of the first\
  \ classes we redesigned, alongside the rogue, cleric, and wizard. We knew that we\
  \ wanted these four to work well in concert with each other, with the fighter taking\
  \ on the role of primary combat character, good at taking damage and even better\
  \ at dealing damage. The fighter has to be the best with weapons, using his class\
  \ options to give him an edge with his weapons of choice. The fighter also has to\
  \ be mobile, able to get into the fray quickly and hold the line, allowing less\
  \ melee-oriented characters time to get into position and use their abilities without\
  \ have to fend off constant attacks.</p> \n     <p>Let's start by looking at some\
  \ of the features shared by all fighters.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb360\">\n\

  ></a> \n      <p><i>Illustration by Wayne Reynolds</i></p>\n     </div> \n     <p>First\
  \ up is attacks of opportunity. This feature allows you to spend your reaction to\
  \ strike a creature within your reach that tries to manipulate an object (like drinking\
  \ a potion), make a ranged attack, or move away from you. This attack is made with\
  \ a –2 penalty, but it doesn't take the multiple attack penalty from other strikes\
  \ you attempt on your turn. Other classes can get this ability—and numerous monsters\
  \ will as well—but only the fighter starts with it a core feature. Fighters also\
  \ have feat choices that can make their attacks of opportunity more effective.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Next up, at 3rd level, you gain weapon mastery, which increases your\
  \ proficiency rank with one group of weapons to master. Your proficiency rank increases\
  \ to legendary at 13th level, making you truly the best with the weapons of your\
  \ choice. At 19th level, you become a legend with all simple and martial weapons!</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The fighter gets a number of other buffs and increases as well, but\
  \ one I want to call out in particular is battlefield surveyor, which increases\
  \ your Perception proficiency rank to master (you start as an expert), and gives\
  \ you an additional +1 bonus when you roll Perception for initiative, helping you\
  \ be first into the fight!</p> \n     <p>As mentioned in the blog last week, the\
  \ real meat behind the classes is in their feats and (as of this post), the fighter\
  \ has the largest selection of feats out of all the classes in the game! Let's take\
  \ a look at some.</p> \n     <p>You've probably already heard about Sudden Charge.\
  \ You can pick up this feat at 1st level. When you spend two actions on it, this\
  \ feat allows you to move up to twice your speed and deliver a single strike. There's\
  \ no need to move in a straight line and no AC penalty—you just move and attack!\
  \ This feat lets the fighter jump right into the thick of things and make an immediate\
  \ impact.</p> \n     <p>Next let's take a look at Power Attack. This feat allows\
  \ you to spend two actions to make a single strike that deals an extra die of damage.\
  \ Instead of trading accuracy for damage (as it used to work), you now trade out\
  \ an action you could have used for a far less accurate attack to get more power\
  \ on a roll that is more likely to hit.</p> \n     <p>As you go up in level, some\
  \ of the feats really allow you to mix things up. Take the 4th-level feat Quick\
  \ Reversal, for example. If you are being flanked and you miss with your second\
  \ or third attack against one of the flankers, this feat lets you redirect the attack\
  \ to the other target and reroll it, possibly turning a miss into a hit!</p> \n\
  \     <p>We've talked before about how fun and tactical shields are in the game.\
  \ To recap, you take an action to raise your shield and get its Armor Class and\
  \ touch Armor Class bonuses, and then you can block incoming damage with a reaction\
  \ while the shield is raised. At 6th level, fighters can take the feat Shield Warden,\
  \ which allows them to use their shield to block the damage taken by an adjacent\
  \ ally. At 8th, they can even get an extra reaction each turn, just to use shield\
  \ block one additional time. (And yes, they can spend this extra reaction on another\
  \ use of Shield Warden.) At 14th level, a fighter can use their shield to protect\
  \ themself from dragon's breath and fireballs, gaining their shield's bonus to Reflex\
  \ saves.</p> \n     <p>The fighter also has a wide variety of options with ranged\
  \ weapons, allowing you to deal more damage up close or fire more than one arrow\
  \ at a time. I foresee a lot of fighters taking Debilitating Shot, which causes\
  \ a foe to be slowed if the attack hits (causing it to lose one action on its next\
  \ turn).</p> \n     <p>And all this is a small sample. We've made a conscious effort\
  \ to give fighters a number of paths they can pursue using their feats: focusing\
  \ on shields, swinging a two-handed weapon, fighting with two weapons, making ranged\
  \ attacks, and fighting defensively. These paths are pretty open, allowing you to\
  \ mix and match with ease to create a fighter that matches your play style.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The goal here is to give you a variety of tools to deal with the situations\
  \ and encounters you are bound to face. You might walk into a fight with your bow\
  \ and open with Double Shot, allowing you to fire a pair of arrows into the two\
  \ nearest foes, only to swap over to using a greataxe when the rest surround you,\
  \ making an attack against all enemies in your reach with Whirlwind Strike! It all\
  \ comes down to the type of fighter you want to play.</p> \n     <p>Jason Bulmahn<br>\
