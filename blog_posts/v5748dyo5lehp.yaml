  > \n    <p>I'm back in the office after a week and a half in the blissful tropical\
  \ paradise of Hawaii (with a busted computer, no less), and that means work must\
  \ commence. The Spice must flow. And Pathfinder Battles Previews must continue!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>And because I missed last week's update, this week is a double dose of\
  \ goblin greatness, brought to you by yours truly and the fine folks over at WizKids,\
  \ who continue to set new standards with sculpts and painting on our prepainted\
  \ <a href=\"/store/byCompany/w/wizKids/byProductType/pathfinderMiniatures\">Pathfinder\
  \ Battles</a> figures. This week we've got four more figures from the <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8ww8\">We Be Goblins!</a> Builder Series set. Each figure is packed\
  \ in a randomly assorted single-figure blind box for the low price of $2.49, making\
  \ it easier than ever to assemble your very own goblin horde!</p> \n    <p><span\
  \ itemprop=\"description\">We've already previewed four figures from the set on\
  \ previous Fridays, which leaves four more for upcoming weeks. But I've got to churn\
  \ through them FAST, because we are at the very doorstep of the announcement of\
  \ the very next full set. WizKids brought the first round of paint masters for THAT\
  \ by the office this week, and they are better than anything we've seen from them\
  \ before. But that's getting ahead of myself. Onward my goblin soldiers!</span></p>\

  \ of our very first goblin figure from the original <a href=\"/products/btpy8mq6\"\
  >Heroes &amp; Monsters</a> set. This figure is almost sold out on the secondary\
  \ market, and has been commanding some pretty crazy prices, which is one reason\
  \ we wanted to bring him out again and give gamers another shot at him. You can\
  \ never have too many mooks, after all.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n\
  \     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130222-Commando_500.jpeg\"><img\
  \ src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130222-Commando_180.jpeg\" border=\"\

  \ from the <a href=\"/products/btpy8rqs\">Rise of the Runelords</a> set. With his\
  \ mighty horsechopper in hand, this little guy is ready to terrorize your campaigns!</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130222-Reta_500.jpeg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130222-Reta_180.jpeg\" border=\"\

  \ than a goblin in a wedding dress wearing a wig of beautiful blonde hair? How about\
  \ the same goblin, with a bow and arrow? We added this feature to the figure because\
  \ the original illustration didn't have a weapon, and we thought she was scarier\
  \ this way. And also awesomer (did you know publishers get to use fake words without\
  \ consequence?).</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130222-Mogmurch_500.jpeg\"\

  0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>And here we have the titular bomb from the name of\
  \ this week's blog. Why, it's Mogmurch the goblin alchemist, complete with a cool\
  \ skull helmet and an even cooler olde tyme bomb ready to go off in his hand. Or\
  \ at the feet of your player characters!</p> \n    <p>Mogmurch and Reta are playable\
  \ characters in <a href=\"/products/btpy8wvm\">We Be Goblins Too!</a>, this year's\
  \ Paizo offering for Free RPG Day! That promotion takes place at game stores all\
  \ around the world on June 15th. The <a href=\"/products/btpy8ww8\">We Be Goblins\
  \ Builder Series</a> set is scheduled for a May 29 release.</p> \n    <p>See you\
