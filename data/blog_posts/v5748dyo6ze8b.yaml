  \  </div>\n     <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Greetings, Starfinders!<br>\n\
  \        We’d like to thank our entire community from the bottom of our hearts for\
  \ the overwhelmingly enthusiastic reception we’ve seen for the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6zwqx\"\
  >Starfinder Tech Class Playtest</a>! The playtest is still ongoing, and you can\
  \ fill out (and modify) your feedback surveys until May 30th.</p>\n      <p>We know\
  \ you’re eager for new adventure content to playtest with, so we’ve cooked up a\
  \ little bonus encounter for you to run for mechanics, technomancers, and their\
  \ allies! Check that out at the end of this blog!</p>\n      <p>Additionally, the\
  \ team has already received tremendously useful feedback, and we’ve spotted some\
  \ irregularities in our code that might cause your exocortexes or spell databases\
  \ to glitch. So before you take off on your next adventure, make sure your mechanic\
  \ and technomancer are properly patched and updated with the newest addition to\
  \ the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/starfinderplaytest/faq\">Official Starfinder Playtest\
  \ FAQ</a>. We’ve included a summary and explanation of some of the changes below:</p>\n\
  \      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/93269716-aedc-41fa-b58c-40f3d36c56e0/PZO7601_Part3_Opener.jpg\"\

  \      <br>\n      <h3><strong>Mechanic</strong></h3>\n      <ul>\n       <li><strong>Modify\
  \ Possession:</strong> Some Starfinders have expressed concern that Modify doesn’\
  t work with grenades, thrown weapons, and exocortexes that leave your possession\
  \ when used. To fix this, under \"Modify\" on page 4, replace the line \"or leaves\
  \ your possession\" with \"or a character other than you, your drone, or your turret\
  \ attempts to use the item.\"</li>\n       <li><strong>Modify Drone:</strong> You\
  \ need the Modify Drone feat in order to modify the weapons on your drone. Remove\
  \ \"and any weapons it wields\" from the first sentence of the third paragraph under\
  \ Drone on page 5.</li>\n       <li><strong>Deploy Mine:</strong> Using an extra\
  \ action to deploy a mine should only change whether or not you can deploy it in\
  \ an unoccupied square, not how far away you can deploy it. Replace the text of\
  \ Deploy Mine with the following: “You deploy a mine, planting it in an unoccupied\
  \ square within 30 feet. You can increase the number of actions you spend Deploying\
  \ a Mine to two to instead plant the mine in an occupied square within 30 feet.\
  \ When you Deploy a Mine, you select whether it will deal fire damage or piercing\
  \ damage when detonated.”</li>\n       <li><strong>Aucturnite Ammunition:</strong>\
  \ Transmutative Casing (feat 8) allows you to deal damage as if you were using aucturnite.\
  \ Aucturnite ammunition and weapons gain the critical (mental) trait.</li>\n   \
  \    <li><strong>Advanced &amp; Elite Drone Prerequisites:</strong> Change the prerequisite\
  \ of Advanced Drone (feat 14) to Refined Chassis. Change the prerequisite of Elite\
  \ Drone (feat 18) to Advanced Drone.</li>\n       <li><strong>Convertible Chassis:</strong>\
  \ Replace the text of Convertible Chassis (feat 14) with the following: “Your drone\
  \ easily converts between different forms. During daily preparations, choose two\
  \ different chassis for your drone. You can select a different chassis as a 1-hour\
  \ activity with the concentrate and manipulate traits. Your drone gains the Mobile\
  \ Reconfiguration action. <strong>Mobile Reconfiguration</strong> [two actions]\
  \ Your drone changes itself from one of its chassis to another.”</li>\n      </ul>\n\
  \      <h3><strong>Robot Companion</strong></h3>\n      <p>· <strong>Robot Companion\
  \ Skills:</strong> Like animal companions, robot companions are always trained in\
  \ Acrobatics and Athletics, so they don’t need those skills as bonus skill proficiencies.\
  \ Replace the Agile Chassis robot companion's skill with Stealth, and the Powerful\
  \ Chassis and Tank Chassis robot companion's skill with Survival.</p>\n      <p>·\
  \ <strong>Graceful and Burly:</strong> Graceful robot companions use the same adjustments\
  \ as a nimble animal companion. Burly robot companions use the same adjustments\
  \ as a savage animal companion.</p>\n      <h3><strong>Technomancer</strong></h3>\n\
  \      <p>· <strong>Defensive Measures:</strong> Change the technomancer feature\
  \ Defensive Measures to increase your proficiency rank in unarmored defense and\
  \ light armor to expert.</p>\n      <p>· <strong>Electrotether:</strong> The spell\
  \ <em>electrotether</em> is the updated version of the <em>gravity tether</em> spell\
  \ from the Starfinder Playtest rulebook. It uses the same statistics as <em>gravity\
  \ tether</em>, except it has the electricity trait and can target up to two creatures\
  \ (even if it’s not heightened).</p>\n      <p>· <strong>Spell Transfer Protocol:</strong>\
  \ The magic hack <em>spell transfer protocol </em>was cut during development. The\
  \ advanced magic hack for the ServoShell programming language is <em>hardlight simulacrum</em>.</p>\n\
  \      <p>While publishing errata for a playtest is unusual, we feel some of these\
  \ changes dramatically changed how these classes were played and needed to be addressed\
  \ early on in the playtest process. And if you’re still looking for opportunities\
  \ to playtest these classes, stay tuned to this blog and check out the games being\
  \ offered at this year’s <a href=\"https://paizo.com/paizocon\">PaizoCon</a>!</p>\n\

  ></p>\n      </div>\n      <br>\n      <h3><strong>Artificial Anomalies and the\
  \ Awkward Attack on Actors (Moderate 1)</strong></h3>\n      <p>Designed by Aras\
  \ Yazgan</p>\n      <p>This encounter takes place on Akiton, along a trade route\
  \ between the city of Arl and the settlements of Golden Bay. Talk to your players\
  \ about what their characters are doing in the area. Some likely options are bandits,\
  \ performers, or vigilantes patrolling the road. Playing these roles isn’t required,\
  \ but might inspire some fun table banter.</p>\n      <p>The encounter takes place\
  \ soon after the emergence of the Newborn (during the events of <em>A Cosmic Birthday</em>).\
  \ A traveling theater troupe called the Aspiring Acting Aggregate has just started\
  \ its yearly trip between the cities of the Ridgelands. On the way to Booster City,\
  \ they were attacked by a group of robots experiencing an existential awakening\
  \ due to psychic energy released by the Newborn. The robots draped themselves in\
  \ fabric to appear human, then fired a turret at the troupe to scare them into abandoning\
  \ their bus.</p>\n      <p>If the PCs talk to the troupe, an older woman named <strong>Madame\
  \ Garvino</strong> (indignant female human stage manager) explains the situation:\
  \ “Some upstarts set up a scheme just on the edge of Arlkari Plateau. The gall!\
  \ They robbed us blind, not only of credits, but of our cloth, our smoke machines…\
  \ Our everything was in that bus! We’re ruined.” She describes the ambush, explaining\
  \ how snipers shot at them from a distance while two hooded figures ordered them\
  \ to leave their bus, commenting, “The youth these days have no respect!”</p>\n\
  \      <p>When the PCs investigate the ambush site described by Madame Garvino,\
  \ they find bits of cloth strewn atop the rocks, made to look like ambushers. An\
  \ abandoned tour bus with AAA’s logo on the side is parked behind the rocks, emptied\
  \ of valuables. As they investigate, the PCs notice electronic chittering and movement\
  \ from the ruins to the northwest.</p>\n      <p>Read or paraphrase the following\
  \ to set the scene:</p>\n      <p>Two twig-thin rusty robots are moving electronics.\
  \ One stops abruptly and yells, “Darling! Darling! Rumbled! That is what we are!”\
  \ The other responds with: “You wanna get my kiddo, you’re gonna have to go through\
  \ me, bucko,” a famous line from an old audio theater show. They drop what they\
  \ were holding and take aggressive stances.</p>\n      <p><strong>Map</strong>:\
  \ Use the desert map from <em>Starfinder Flip-Mat: Alien Ruins</em></p>\n      <p><strong>Creatures</strong>:\
  \ Two repair-class security robots have been newly awakened into Sentient Robotic\
  \ Organisms (SROs), but they lack the emotional regulation and sophistication to\
  \ communicate properly. Each robot starts barely within the view of the PCs arriving\
  \ from the southeast, one up north and the other to the west. The robots reposition\
  \ around the rocks to lure the PCs into the turret’s range, which is placed on the\
  \ slightly elevated plateau surrounded on three sides with rocks. If the PCs attack\
  \ the turret, the robots desperately try to protect it. If the turret breaks, one\
  \ stops attacking, drops prone, and spends all its actions yelling “Nooooo!” while\
  \ the other attacks the PC who last dealt damage to the turret in a frenzy.</p>\n\
  \      <p><strong>Adjustments:</strong> If the robots are put out of commission\
  \ before they can act or lure the players to the turret, one or two more robots\
  \ emerge from the ruins to keep the battle going.</p>\n      <p><strong>Hazards</strong>:\
  \ A laser turret is set up behind the wall, hidden by the rocks. It’s surrounded\
  \ by random knickknacks from the AAA bus.</p>\n      <br>\n      <blockquote>\n\

  \      </blockquote>\n      <br>\n      <p><strong>Development: </strong>A PC who\
  \ succeeds at a DC 14 Computers or Crafting check realizes the robots are displaying\
  \ complex behaviors that suggest they have developed emotions, higher thinking,\
  \ and possibly even free will. A DC 18 Occultism or Religion check correctly determines\
  \ that the robots have developed souls. The robots aren’t responsive to attempts\
  \ at diplomacy during the battle, but afterward, they might be repaired and counseled\
  \ rather than simply scrapped. The AAA troupe’s missing property is scattered around\
  \ the rocks, set up haphazardly to resemble a crude stage.</p>\n      <p>If the\
  \ PCs return the bus and equipment to Madame Garvino, she rewards them for their\
  \ help (or pays handsomely to buy back her goods, if the PCs are less charitable).\
  \ If the robots were repaired and counseled, she warily agrees to take them on as\
  \ apprentice actors, admitting that their “performance” was quite spectacular.</p>\n\
