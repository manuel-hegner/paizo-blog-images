  description\">So, there is an <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ldz2\">announcement</a>\
  \ on the Paizo blog about the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game going into semi-open\
  \ playtests. The \"collaborative deck-building game\" (which is neither completely\
  \ collaborative nor completely deck-building, but work with me) is probably the\
  \ best game system I've ever designed, and I'd like to tell you a little bit about\
  \ it.</span></p> \n     <p>The basic concept is this: It's a cooperative game for\
  \ one to six players. Each player has a unique character composed of a deck of cards\
  \ and a set of stats. Roleplayers will find the stats very familiar—characters have\
  \ roles and numbers that define their abilities and skills. As you go through adventures,\
  \ you'll improve your deck by acquiring new items, allies, weapons, and other cool\
  \ things as you explore and overcome challenges; over time, you'll be customizing\
  \ your deck to suit your own individual vision of your character. All adventures\
  \ are composed of infinitely usable cards and decks. There's no Game Master, no\
  \ recordkeeping, no expository dialogue. It's everything I want to do in a roleplaying\
  \ game without the workload. It plays in an hour to an hour and a half.</p> \n \

  \ border=\"0\" hspace=\"2\"></a>\n      <br> These playtest cards were designed\
  \ for single-sided, black-and-white printing. In the finished game, card borders\
  \ will have colors instead of just shades of grey, and the charts that currently\
  \ overlap the images on \"Them Ogres Ain't Right\" and \"The Rusty Dragon\" will\
  \ move to the back of the card.\n     </div> \n     <h2>How We Got Here</h2> \n\
  \     <p>About a year ago, Rian Sand came to me with a theoretical idea of a design\
  \ space that hadn't yet been explored much: a card game that mimicked many of the\
  \ behaviors of a traditional RPG, but without a lot of the time and administrative\
  \ burden. I had also been thinking about some mechanics for a system like that,\
  \ and Rian's enthusiasm and support made me invest serious design time into it.\
  \ There were a lot of problems that had to be solved—persistence, goal development,\
  \ game speed, and so on—and I'm pretty sure we solved them all.</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ original game was for a new intellectual property that I'm not prepared to talk\
  \ about yet. Suffice it to say that it's really cool, and Mike Vaillancourt and\
  \ Matt Forbeck had a lot to do with making it cool, and you'll see it someday soon.\
  \ Not sure when, not sure how, but soon.</p> \n     <p>But as we were doing this,\
  \ we were thinking about what our first licensed game had to be. Various ideas were\
  \ tossed around, but for Rian and me, there was only one choice. Rian was a major\
  \ fan of the Pathfinder RPG, and I... well, I was a major fan of Paizo. Owners Vic\
  \ Wertz and Lisa Stevens have shown considerable benevolence and respect my way\
  \ over the past years, leading to such awesome projects as the Harrow Deck, the\
  \ Kill Doctor Lucky color edition, Yetisburg, and the American version of Key Largo.\
  \ Lone Shark has done more games for Paizo than for any other company, and if they\
  \ were interested in following us down this garden path, they were going to get\
  \ to do so.</p> \n     <p>It turns out that after a discussion with Paizo's Publisher\
  \ Erik Mona and Chief Operating Officer Jeff Alvarez at the GAMA Trade Show, they\
  \ were very interested. Pathfinder Lead Designer Jason Bulmahn saw a version of\
  \ the system at the first unveiling at Gamestorm, and brought back much appreciated\
  \ words of praise. I showed it to the Paizo team back in Redmond, including James\
  \ Jacobs, Sarah Robinson, and Wes Schneider, and we were underway within a few weeks.\
  \ And over those weeks, we were bombarded with very heavy books and offers to help\
  \ from everyone on the Paizo staff. It became a project all of Paizo could participate\
  \ in.</p> \n     <p>The game continued to grow and change under the Paizo stewardship.\
  \ My talented developers Chad Brown, Paul Peterson, and Gaby Weidling quickly came\
  \ to understand the magnitude of the challenge ahead of us. Pathfinder is huge.\
  \ Paizo had given us the now-classic Rise of the Runelords Adventure Path as a template\
  \ for our games, which meant we had to adapt an incredibly deep and involving series\
  \ of stories into the few words and concepts that fit on cards. It was not so easy,\
  \ but it made us examine and reexamine every aspect of my system to make it work.\
  \ It's now much tighter and much more fun.</p> \n     <p>Under the codename \"Project\
  \ Swallowtail,\" we showed off a very raw version of it at PaizoCon, and a more\
  \ robust version at Gen Con. And now we're going into a massive playtest with the\
  \ Pathfinder Society to get the game exactly right. It's got a ways to get there,\
  \ but it seems pretty good now. Time will tell.</p> \n     <h2>How the Game Plays</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>You start by creating a party of adventurers. Each of you gets a character\
  \ card such as Valeros, Seoni, or Merisiel. That card tells you what cards your\
  \ deck consists of. A wizard might have more spells than weapons, and a fighter\
  \ will likely have more weapons than spells.</p> \n     <p>You'll select an Adventure\
  \ Path, which consists of several adventures, which consist of several scenarios.\
  \ A typical scenario tells you what villains and henchmen you'll face (if any),\
  \ and the locations in which you'll face them. Each location has a deck of cards,\
  \ drawn at random from appropriate stacks, and then shuffled in with a villain or\
  \ henchman. You won't know where the villain is until you find him.</p> \n     <p>Throughout\
  \ the game, you'll explore locations, encounter monsters, and find new weapons,\
  \ items, spells, and the like. But you're racing a clock. The adventure deck is\
  \ a stack of cards that you'll flip one card off of every turn. If the adventure\
  \ deck runs out of cards before you find and defeat the villain, you lose. If your\
  \ character deck runs out of cards, you die.</p> \n     <p>But if you don't die,\
  \ then you'll advance your character. You'll get to put new cards in your deck,\
  \ expand your powers and abilities, and rebuild your deck for new adventures. If\
  \ you defeat all the scenarios in the game, you'll be a mighty adventurer indeed.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Thanks for reading, and I hope you like the Pathfinder Adventure Card\
  \ Game. I can't wait to see what you think.</p> \n     <p>Mike Selinker<br> <i>Pathfinder\
