  \ border of the Inner Sea region? Eager to set sail to mysterious Arcadia, follow\
  \ trade roads into vast Casmaron, or venture to legendary Vudra? The journey you\
  \ chose is up to you, but your destination is right here: <a href=\"/products/btpy9gro\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Distant Shores</em></a>.</p> \n    <p>Over years\
  \ of developing the Inner Sea region we've dropped countless hints about this mysterious\
  \ relic from Iblydos or that distant ruin in Holomog. Now, we're pulling back the\
  \ curtain just a peak. Actually, we're pulling back six curtains, revealing destination\
  \ cities on the fringes of such mysterious lands as Arcadia, Casmaron, Iblydos,\
  \ Tian-Xia, Southern Garund, and Vudra. For the first time ever, we're detailing\
  \ major cities in these distant regions (or unexplored nations therein), giving\
  \ you full-fledged, thriving settings for you to explore. Each of these six cities\
  \ presents new rules options along with them, be they a new player race, new deities\
  \ to worship, new mythic abilities to claim, or other character options, assuring\
  \ that your journey to distant shores leaves a distinctive mark.</p> \n    <p>As\
  \ defining the lands beyond the Inner Sea region is such a major undertaking for\
  \ us, we trusted these explorations to six in-house authors who have already proven\
  \ themselves experts on these rich lands. In their authors' words, here are the\
  \ six cities you'll find in Distant Shores, as well as some of the most exciting\
  \ elements you'll learn about in each.</p> \n    <h2>Aelyosos, City of Tides, by\
  \ John Compton</h2> \n    <p>The people of Iblydos owe their existence to the cyclopses\
  \ that emigrated from Ghol-Gan during that doomed empire's decline, and though the\
  \ giants have dwindled in number since, they and humans continue to co-exist on\
  \ the archipelago. The greatest mortals earn the rite of myth-speaking, in which\
  \ the cyclopses foresee how that hero might attain mythic power through great deeds.\
  \ Many of these so-called hero-gods have since ruled one of Iblydos's city-states,\
  \ granting spells to followers and heralding in a new age of prosperity or tyranny.\
  \ Since the deaths of Aroden and prophecy itself, the tradition has failed with\
  \ troubling frequency. Now the last hero-gods age and dwindle, and a new generation\
  \ of heroes must arise to combat the greatest threat to the islands: the thalassic\
  \ behemoth Ousmariku.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderCampaignSetting/PZO9285-Aelyosos.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n     <br><i>Illustration by Davi Blight</i>\n    </div> \n    <h2>Anuli,\
  \ City of New Beginnings, by Crystal Frasier</h2> \n    <p>I wrote up Anuli, the\
  \ furthest-north city in the celestially empowered nation of Holomog. It stands\
  \ out as a matriarchy that isn't evil, and as a good-aligned nation that still has\
  \ plenty of possibility for adventure: political intrigue, chaos cults, an evil\
  \ nation of undead on their borders, and 10,000 years worth of abandoned cities\
  \ and ruins. Anuli is also the only nation on Golarion that has been continuously\
  \ exposed to the energies of the outer planes for millennia, causing a number of\
  \ unexpected side-effects, including a new player race.</p> \n    <h2>Dhucharg,\
  \ City of Conquerors, by Amanda Hamon-Kunz</h2> \n    <p>The most intriguing part\
  \ about fleshing out Dhucharg was playing with the pervasive undercurrents of dissidence\
  \ and discord that must naturally arise in a city with absolutely rigid and militaristic\
  \ social and political structures. On one hand, I got to create a society that has\
  \ a law for everything, and into which each individual literally has a prescribed\
  \ place. On the other hand, there's this sense that if any of the dissident elements\
  \ in the city gain traction, the entire thing might collapse. Mix that intrigue\
  \ with the fact that Dhucharg is a city of hobgoblins (some of the coolest goblinoids!)\
  \ and this assignment was a blast indeed!</p> \n    <h2>Radripal, City of Arches,\
  \ by Mark Moreland</h2> \n    <p>Since I first read about Vudra in the original\
  \ Pathfinder Chronicles Gazetteer, I've been captivated by this fantasy version\
  \ of India. So when the opportunity arose to further flesh out this part of the\
  \ setting, I couldn't let it pass me by. My favorite part of writing Radripal was\
  \ getting to define three new Vudran deities (of which there are hundreds) and to\
  \ detail a non-evil city ruled by a rakshasa. Placing the riverside city on both\
  \ sides of a natural bridge allowed me to define two distinct parts of the city\
  \ and play with the interactions between them from a religious, social, economic,\
  \ and demographic perspective.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\
  //static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderCampaignSetting/PZO9285-Radripal.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderCampaignSetting/PZO9285-Radripal_500.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br><i>Illustration by Ben Wootten</i>\n    </div> \n    <h2>Segada,\
  \ City of Keys, by Adam Daigle</h2> \n    <p>When we first started talking about\
  \ which city in Arcadia we'd detail, the first things that popped up were places\
  \ that we've already mentioned, but many of us weren't interested in doing an Avistani\
  \ colony in a land ripe for something new. We did realize that we needed some element\
  \ of a touchstone that people were familiar with, so with Segada you get to see\
  \ not only a city full of Arcadians, but you also get to see how they interact with\
  \ the Avistanis that have recently come to their shores.</p> \n    <h2>Ular Kel,\
  \ The Caravan City, by James L. Sutter</h2> \n    <p>A while back, I wrote <a href=\"\
  /pathfinder/tales/serial/boarAndRabbit\">a web fiction story called \"Boar and Rabbit\"\
  </a> about two men of the Iridian Fold who are major characters in <a href=\"/products/btpy94r3\"\
  ><em>The Redemption Engine</em></a>. I'd already decided that the Iridian Fold (introduced\
  \ way back in <a href=\"/products/btpy8fda\"><em>City of Strangers</em></a>) came\
  \ from a place called Karazh in central Casmaron, a region inspired in part by the\
  \ real-world steppes of Kazakhstan and other Central Asian nations—places that frankly\
  \ get short shrift in the States. (I'm ashamed to admit that, not that many years\
  \ ago, I thought Kazakhstan had been made up by comedian Sascha Baron Cohen. I blame\
  \ the American public school system.) While \"Boar and Rabbit\" was primarily a\
  \ prince-and-pauper love story, the bits of description I was able to seed about\
  \ Karazh's capital city of Ular Kel kept nagging at me, and I started keeping notes.\
  \ As soon as Wes posited the idea of the <em>Distant Shores project</em>, I pounced\
  \ on it, and I'm thrilled to finally get Ular Kel out of my head and into the public\
  \ eye at last!</p> \n    <p>You won't have to for long to plan your far-flung adventures,\
  \ as <a href=\"/products/btpy9gro\"><em>Distant Shores</em></a> releases this month.\
  \ And be sure to let us know which regions are your favorites—as it might help us\
  \ decide where to explore in more detail next!</p> \n    <p>F. Wesley Schneider<br>\
