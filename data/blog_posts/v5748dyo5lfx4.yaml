  \ last year that we planned to make it the biggest and best Gen Con yet. And it\
  \ certainly was. We scheduled 1,400 tables of Pathfinder Society over the four days.\
  \ We showed the world our GM 101 and GM 201 workshops, Kid's Beginner &amp; Advanced\
  \ Tracks, and Beginner Box Introductions, Parts 1 and 2. Gen Con was definitely\
  \ a success and Paizo's biggest showing in history. But we can make it bigger and\
  \ better!</span></p> \n     <p>Paizo will once again be a cosponsor at this year's\
  \ show. What does that mean for Pathfinder Society? It means we return to the Sagamore\
  \ Ballroom! We increase our playspace size, scheduling 150 to 170 tables per slot.\
  \ Additionally, we also have two of the seven rooms that were used for Pathfinder\
  \ Society last year. One of them will be used exclusively for Paizo seminars. The\
  \ other room will have 10 tables and will be utilized for <i>Pathfinder Adventure\
  \ Card Game</i> play.</p> \n     <p>We are planning to schedule 20 different scenarios,\
  \ two Gen Con Specials, one Gen Con Exclusive, and two modules, <i>We Be Goblins!</i>\
  \ and <i>We Be Goblins Too!</i> throughout the course of the convention.</p> \n\
  \     <p>The beginning of Season 6 Gen Con Special, <i>The Paths We Choose</i>,\
  \ scheduled for Thursday night, will help us kick off Season 6 by showing off the\
  \ achievements of many of the factions' Season 5 goals. As a tease, here is the\
  \ short description as it will appear in the Gen Con catalog:</p> \n     <p><i>The\
  \ failure of Mendev's wardstones set in motion not only a new crusade, but also\
  \ catalyzed a change in the Society's various factions.</i></p> \n     <p>More information\
  \ on the factions and surpirses upcoming will be offered in a series of blog posts\
  \ later this year. This special is designed for levels 3—7.</p> \n     <p>The end\
  \ of Season 5 Gen Con Special, <i>Legacy of the Stonelords</i>, scheduled for Friday\
  \ night, will help us close Season 5 inside the Worldwound! </p> \n     <p>As a\
  \ tease, here is the long description as it will appear in the Gen Con catalog:</p>\
  \ \n     <p><i>At long last, the Pathfinders have reached the lost Sky Citadel Jormurdun\
  \ only to find it already occupied by fiends and subterranean foes. The Society\
  \ must mount an epic offense to explore the immense subterranean city while simultaneously\
  \ driving off the squatters within. If they succeed, the Pathfinders may discover\
  \ that the greatest prize is not the mountain fortress itself but the treasure that\
  \ lies at its heart. The adventure concludes Season 5, Year of the Demon.</i></p>\
  \ \n     <p>This Special is designed for levels 1—11.</p> \n     <p>The scenarios\
  \ being scheduled for Gen Con are as follows:</p> \n     <h2>Season 5</h2> \n  \
  \   <ul> \n      <li><i>#5—06: You Have What You Hold</i></li> \n      <li><i>#5—\
  08: The Confirmation</i></li> \n      <li><i>#5—09: The Traitor's Lodge</i></li>\
  \ \n      <li><i>#5—10: Where Mammoths Dare Not Tread</i></li> \n      <li><i>#5—\
  12: Destiny of the Sands, Part 1: A Bitter Bargain</i></li> \n      <li><i>#5—13:\
  \ Weapon in the Rift</i></li> \n      <li><i>#5—15: Destiny of the Sands, Part 2:\
  \ Race to Seeker's Folly</i></li> \n      <li><i>#5—16: Destiny of the Sands, Part\
  \ 3: Sanctum of the Sages</i></li> \n      <li><i>#5—17: Fate of the Fiend</i></li>\
  \ \n      <li><i>#5—18: The Stranger Within</i></li> \n      <li><i>#5—19: The Horn\
  \ of Aroden</i></li> \n      <li><i>#5—20: The Sealed Gate</i></li> \n      <li><i>#5—\
  21: The Merchant's Wake</i></li> \n      <li><i>#5—22: Scars of the Third Crusade</i></li>\
  \ \n      <li><i>#5—23: Cairn of Shadows</i></li> \n      <li><i>#5—24: Assault\
  \ on the Wound</i></li> \n      <li><i>#5—25: Vengeance at Sundered Crag</i><p></p>\
  \ </li>\n     </ul> \n     <h2>Season 6</h2> \n     <ul> \n      <li><i>#6—01: Trial\
  \ by Machine</i></li> \n      <li><i>#6—02: The Silver Mount Collection</i></li>\
  \ \n      <li><i>#6—03: The Technic Siege</i><p></p> </li>\n     </ul> \n     <p>We\
  \ will be offering one exclusive on Saturday night. We will follow up <i>Ruins of\
  \ Bonekeep, Levels 1 and 2</i>, with <i>Bonekeep, Level 3: The Wakening Tomb</i>\
  \ also written by Jason. It is being designed for Tier 5—9 characters and again,\
  \ will be particularly challenging and lethal. <i>Ruins of Bonekeep, Level 3</i>\
  \ will make its debut at Gen Con. We will only run level three one time at Gen Con\
  \ so it will be a truly limited and exclusive event. On a side note, we will have\
  \ a few tables running all three of the new Season 6 scenarios if you would rather\
  \ not participate in this exclusive.</p> \n     <p>In regard to the Beginner Box\
  \ Introductions, we have two different offerings again this year. During seven slots\
  \ at Gen Con, we are setting aside six tables for these Beginner Box Introduction\
  \ events. Both parts are scheduled with new players in mind. For Beginner Box Introductions,\
  \ Part 1, it will allow for the first 45—60 minutes to be an exploration of the\
  \ contents of the <i><i>Pathfinder RPG Beginner Box</i></i>, explaining the rules,\
  \ and reviewing the pregenerated characters. The final 4 hours of each slot will\
  \ be playing through the four, 1-hour adventures. For Beginner Box Introductions,\
  \ Part 2, the GM will assist players in advancing their character to third level.\
  \ The <i>Beginner Box Transitions</i>, <i>Player Pack</i>, and <i>GM Kit</i> will\
  \ be reviewed. Once those three free documents have been briefly covered, we will\
  \ be offering up five 1-hour adventures as time permits. Much like the four adventures\
  \ in part one, these will be utilizing only the <i>Beginner Box</i> rules.</p> \n\
  \     <p>For the Pathfinder's Kids' Track, we will be setting aside six tables at\
  \ seven slots during the convention. We are focusing on players aged 6—12 and we\
  \ will be using the <i>Pathfinder RPG Beginner Box</i> for this as well. The Kids'\
  \ Track is divided into two parts: the Beginner Track and the Advanced Track. Each\
  \ kid's beginner track slot will be 2 hours long and each player will receive a\
  \ check-off card. The first hour of each of the seven Kids' Beginner Track sessions\
  \ teaches roleplay and rules, and reviews the pregenerated characters found in the\
  \ <i>Pathfinder RPG Beginner Box</i>. During the second hour, one of the four, 1-hour\
  \ adventures used during the Beginner Box Bash will be played. </p> \n     <p>For\
  \ the Kids' Advanced Track, we are focusing on children who participated in last\
  \ year's Kids' Beginner Track, at a local Kids' Beginner Track session near their\
  \ home, or for older children that have prior experience with <i>Pathfinder Roleplaying\
  \ Game</i>. The GM at each of the 2-hour slots will help the children level their\
  \ chosen character to third level. After leveling is complete, the GM will run one\
  \ of five new adventures designed using the <i>Beginner Box</i> rules. </p> \n \
  \    <p>We will be running each of the nine different adventures multiple times\
  \ throughout the convention to allow flexible scheduling for children and parents.\
  \ We will be restricting tables to four children players and are requiring a parent\
  \ or guardian be present with their child (or multiple children if they have two\
  \ or more interested in participating) for the entire 2 hours. The parent or guardian\
  \ will assist the child when needed. But, we want to make this a good and memorable\
  \ experience for the kids that attend Gen Con, who often find little they can participate\
  \ in, especially with others their own age. We will be scheduling 24, 2-hour tables\
  \ per day on Thursday through Saturday, and 12, 2-hour tables on Sunday, for the\
  \ Kids' Track, divided between the Beginner and Advanced Tracks. </p> \n     <p>If\
  \ a child plays all four different adventures in the Beginner's Track, he will be\
  \ able to present his check-off card to HQ and receive a special certificate that\
  \ celebrates his accomplishments. If a child plays all five different adventures\
  \ in the advanced track, she will be able to present her check-off card to HQ and\
  \ receive a second, different special certificate. Both certificates can be used\
  \ on the child's Pathfinder Society character if they did to advance from the <i>Beginner\
  \ Box</i> to the full <i>Core Rulebook</i> rules and participate in Pathfinder Society\
  \ Organized Play. We may also have other give-aways or special prizes, such as dice\
  \ and miniatures, similar to last year. <b>I will be very picky when choosing volunteer\
  \ GMs for the Kids' Track</b>. I prefer to have school teachers and other professionals\
  \ with experience dealing with children. I will consider GMs who are parents even\
  \ if they do not deal with children regularly in their profession. If you are volunteering\
  \ to GM the Kids' Track, please make sure to include all of your credentials. Also,\
  \ since these are scheduled as 2-hour blocks, a GM will be required to run two Kids'\
  \ Track slots back to back in a 4-hour block to count as one slot of credit toward\
  \ GM rewards.</p> \n     <p>We will be running a new set of Pathfinder Quests inside\
  \ the Sagamore and I do have a very few spots of 5-hour blocks for any GM interested\
  \ in running those for players as they show up and fill the quests tables.</p> \n\
  \     <p>We are also bringing back the popular GM 101 and GM 201 seminars and need\
  \ instructors to oversee the running of both. Both seminars will be offered on Thursday,\
  \ Friday, and Saturday. </p> \n     <p>Finally, I need volunteers who have experience\
  \ with the <i><i>Pathfinder Adventure Card Game</i></i>, to run demos in the Dealer\
  \ Hall next to Paizo's booth, as well as run tables in a break out room next to\
  \ Paizo's Seminar Room, from 8 a.m. until midnight Thursday through Saturday, and\
  \ from 9 a.m. until 2 p.m. on Sunday. You can volunteer to work one or two 5-hour\
  \ blocks each day from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. (Sunday ends at 4 pm) in the Dealer Hall.\
  \ Volunteering for any demo time will count toward your GM reward credit below,\
  \ but you still must have a minimum of seven, 5-hour sessions to qualify for a hotel\
  \ room as a Tier 2 volunteer.</p> \n     <p>Now, let's talk about the GMs and volunteers\
  \ we need to pull all of the above off and make it the biggest and best Gen Con\
  \ ever. </p> \n     <p>I need a minimum of 350 volunteer GMs for Pathfinder Society\
  \ games, Beginner Box Introductions, Kids' Track events, GM 101 and 201, and <i>Pathfinder\
  \ Adventure Card Game</i> demos. I'll continue taking volunteer GMs until the slots\
  \ are filled, at which point I will create a waiting list in the event that a scheduled\
  \ GM has to cancel their Gen Con trip for whatever reason. I also need a few Volunteer\
  \ Assistants for each slot of the show. These folks will not GM during their volunteer\
  \ slots, but will instead help me run Pathfinder Society HQ, including marshalling,\
  \ collecting tickets, distributing GM packs, entering tracking sheets into the database,\
  \ and will be our go-to guys and gals for all things Pathfinder Society. Keep in\
  \ mind these are very limited and likely to fill up in the first hour after the\
  \ blog goes live.</p> \n     <p>Below you will find the reward structure for volunteering\
  \ at Gen Con 2014. Keep in mind that you're volunteering for slots, not a specific\
  \ event. Those that are able to spice up their event by adding 3-D terrain, props\
  \ that stand out and the like, will be given first consideration for specific events.\
  \ I will let you know the slots and scenarios you have been assigned as soon as\
  \ possible. You may designate what tier scenarios you wish to GM but this is not\
  \ guaranteed to be filled. I will do the best I can to accommodate your requests.\
  \ My target date to have all GMs their assigned schedules is April 4. This should\
  \ allow you plenty of time to plan a schedule, before the May 18 event registration,\
  \ with your friends and family who are also attending Gen Con 2014. Please let me\
  \ know via email which days you will be at the convention and how many slots you\
  \ are volunteering for at Gen Con 2014. </p> \n     <p>When you email me, I need\
  \ you to include the following information in your email:</p> \n     <ul> \n   \
  \   <li>1) What email is tied to your Gen Con account. </li> \n      <li>2) What\
  \ email is tied to your Paizo.com account and what your message board user name\
  \ is.</li> \n      <li>3) I need to know if you have received the purple goblin\
  \ Pathfinder Society volunteer shirts at a previous show. If not, I need to know\
  \ what size you wear.</li> \n     </ul> \n     <h2>Volunteer Tiers and Rewards</h2>\
