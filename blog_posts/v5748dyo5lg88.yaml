  >Even during the brainstorming and initial design for the <a href=\"/products/btpy95d1\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder RPG Advanced Class Guide</i></a>, the bloodrager was the \"weird\"\
  \ class. The concept was strong—a mix of the barbarian and the sorcerer that used\
  \ bloodlines to fuel its arcane rage—but the weirdness came from the lack of precedent\
  \ for the class. Hunters, investigators, shaman, and swashbucklers were all over\
  \ history, folklore, and were even mentioned in Golarion before they were added\
  \ to this book, but the bloodrager was created out of whole cloth. We thought about\
  \ toying with the name or forcing it into some kind of classical archetype, but\
  \ when we tried either of those, something got lost along the way.</span></p> \n\
  \    <p>While we liked the initial proof of concept, marrying it with another story\
  \ idea did not solve the problem. There was still something missing. Then it came\
  \ like a thunderbolt—spells! The bloodrager needs spells!</p> \n    <p>Like the\
  \ sorcerer, the bloodrager needed to be a spontaneous caster, but we wanted the\
  \ progression to look something like the ranger or the paladin (the bloodrager was\
  \ a full BAB class after all), both of which are prepared casters. The first order\
  \ of business was to design a similar progression for spontaneous casters. Once\
  \ that was done, we had to find the right spell list. Spell lists are tricky beasts,\
  \ and we knew substantial shifts would occur with each design iteration, but we\
  \ needed a starting point. To that end, we chose a modified version of the magus\
  \ list. We knew it wasn't perfect—far from it—but it was the best place to start.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The overall design goal was to create a class that was both easy to build\
  \ and fun to play. Even before we unleashed this most metal of classes to the general\
  \ public, I had a good feeling we were on track. Ryan Macklin decided to give this\
  \ bruiser a whirl during our internal playtests, and loved the feeling of playing\
  \ a character that basically felt like a character off the cover of an old heavy\
  \ metal album, without flipping though a number of sources to get him just right.\
  \ In other words: mission accomplished.</p> \n    <p>When the bloodrager reached\
  \ the public playtest, this sentiment was echoed by a great number of playtesters.\
  \ Were there issues? Sure. As we figured, that spell list wasn't cutting the mustard,\
  \ but it gave us handholds to make the climb toward the class's own spell list.\
  \ There was some fiddling to be done with a number of class features, both those\
  \ that were standard for the class, and those nestled in the bloodlines, but the\
  \ excellent playtest data gave input on where to expand, where to pull back, and\
  \ which ones just needed a little finesse to get right.</p> \n    <p>After some\
  \ playtest chatter, we looked again at renaming the classes or to give it a focus\
  \ that fit better with lore, but in the end the class is what it is called, and\
  \ named what it does. So bloodrager stuck.</p> \n    <p>With the development of\
  \ the bloodrager completed, the next step was the creation of archetypes. This is\
  \ always difficult for classes that basically have archetypes in their design (bloodlines,\
  \ I'm looking at you) but we came up with some exciting options. In <i>Advanced\
  \ Class Guide</i> you'll find the bloodrider (a mounted bloodrager that transfers\
  \ some of his power to his mount) the rageshaper (a rager that gains extra features\
  \ when it changes shape) and the untouchable rager (which replaces spell progression\
  \ with spell resistance). All together, mixing bloodlines with archetypes, you'll\
  \ be able to play a variety of bloodragers!</p> \n    <p>Stephen Radney-MacFarland<br>\
