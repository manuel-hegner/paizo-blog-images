  \ \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Last week, perhaps you heard a great exhaling\
  \ from here in the Pacific Northwest: We shipped the <a href=\"/products/btq01ws7?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Core-Set\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Adventure Card Game: Core Set</em></a> and the <a href=\"/products/btq01ws8?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Curse-of-the-Crimson-Throne-Adventure-Path\"\
  ><em>Curse of the Crimson Throne Adventure Path</em></a> to our printer Cartamundi\
  \ for production.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/products/btq01ws7?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Core-Set\"\

  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/product/catalog/PZO/PZO6041_360.jpeg\"></a> \n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>I've said before that each set takes on the personality of\
  \ one of my talented co-designers—Chad Brown for <em>Rise of the Runelords</em>,\
  \ Gaby Weidling for <em>Skull &amp; Shackles</em>, Tanis O'Connor for the Class\
  \ Decks and Organized Play, Paul Peterson for <em>Wrath of the Righteous</em>, and\
  \ Liz Spain for <em>Mummy's Mask</em>. <em>Curse of the Crimson Throne</em> is Keith\
  \ Richmond's set. He came to Lone Shark in early 2015 specifically to work on that\
  \ product. Four years later, he waved it out the door. I'm sure he'll tell you lots\
  \ more about it soon.</p> \n    <p>However, after many months of design from the\
  \ whole team, the <em>Core Set</em> ended up taking on <i>my</i> personality in\
  \ a very different way. As part of <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkub\">our\
  \ goals</a> for these sets—which have already included <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo6sg8h\"\
  >adding more story</a> and <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgds\">providing more\
  \ variability</a>—we wanted to subject the game to a withering assault of streamlining\
  \ and clarification. The game needed to become less complex so you just <i>get it</i>\
  \ out of the gate.</p> \n    <p>Developer/editor Aviva Schecterson and I form the\
  \ editing core of Lone Shark. When we made the decision to remold—<i>not</i> reboot—\
  the game around a new base set, Aviva and I pledged that we were going to clean\
  \ up <i>everything</i>. All the rough edges, all the open bug-tracking issues, all\
  \ the holes in the timing sequence, all the terms that didn't quite mean what we\
  \ wanted them to mean. All of it was going to be exactly right. For one moment in\
  \ time, before we found new things to complicate it, this 10,000-card game was going\
  \ to be <i>smooth</i>.</p> \n    <p>I don't think Vic was quite ready for how far\
  \ we were willing to go. Vic and I spent a solid six months in editing and polishing\
  \ the two sets, renaming and rethinking concepts as we went. When we were done,\
  \ we had a very different but wholly compatible set of cards—996 of them, to be\
  \ exact—that continue the legacy of this deep and evolving game line.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>There's one thing we knew we wouldn't change: the name of the game. The words\
  \ \"Pathfinder Adventure Card Game\" are on the card back, and we want you to be\
  \ able to mix and match generation 1 cards with generation 2 cards, so the card\
  \ back can't change, nor can the name. (Also, can you tell we play a lot of Poké\
  mon Go in the office?)</p> \n    <p>But the card fronts... man, just look what Sarah\
  \ and Sonja made you.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6040-Wrymsmite.jpg\"\

  ></a> \n     <p>I now wish we'd thought to give the Riding Allosaurus Wyrmsmite\
  \ to chew on.</p>\n    </div> \n    <p>Here are a few <b>Loot</b> cards from the\
  \ <em>Core Set</em>. First off, there's that <b>Loot</b> word. It's in a trait box\
  \ in the lower right (things moved a bit, because sometimes things move a bit).\
  \ And that means Loot is a trait, not a card type. It's got a check to acquire,\
  \ which means that if you decide you don't want to keep it after you earn it, you\
  \ can still find and acquire it later.</p> \n    <p>We also eliminated most of the\
  \ \"objects\" in the game. No, I don't mean items like Caltrops and Compass. I mean\
  \ the grammatical objects like \"this card.\" Instead of saying \"reveal this card,\"\
  \ Wyrmsmite just says \"reveal.\" You're holding it in your hand as you're reading\
  \ it, so it's not going to be any other card. (When we need to differentiate between\
  \ the card you're reading and another card, we do so explicitly, like in \"Recharge\
  \ this card and another card.\") The <b>display</b> template also went through some\
  \ radical changes to make it more intuitive and less of a dense wall of text.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Sometimes we changed a long phrase to a single word. The word <b>reload</b>\
  \ is an <a href=\"/products/btpy9sct\"><em>Apocrypha</em></a> term that's new to\
  \ PACG, but it's a concept that has been in the game since the beginning: it just\
  \ means \"put on top of your deck.\" One word instead of six. But also, we needed\
  \ that word. That's because we really wanted to use that concept. Here's how often\
  \ the concept appeared in each of the Adventure Paths we've created to date:</p>\
  \ \n    <ul>\n     <li><b>Rise of the Runelords</b>: 7</li> \n     <li><b>Skull\
  \ &amp; Shackles:</b> 9</li> \n     <li><b>Wrath of the Righteous:</b> 15</li> \n\
  \     <li><b>Mummy's Mask:</b> 9</li> \n     <li><b>Core/Curse of the Crimson Throne:</b>\
  \ 111</li>\n    </ul> \n    <p>When you want to use a concept nearly three times\
  \ as often as you've used it in all the Adventure Paths you've created so far, you\
  \ need a new term for that. Enter \"reload.\"</p> \n    <p>\"At your location\"\
  \ and \"at another location\" went through a similar transition. We introduced <b>local</b>\
  \ and <b>distant</b> to mean those things. All of a sudden, our vocabulary opened\
  \ up. \"A local character\" was obviously better than \"a character at your location,\"\
  \ but also \"a local check\" was far better than \"a check by a character at your\
  \ location.\"</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6040-RovagugsDestruction.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6040-RovagugsDestruction_180.jpeg\"\

  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6041-Traitor_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n     <p>Rovagug gets TWO different blessings in Core. Pray he does not eat\
  \ the rest.</p>\n    </div> \n    <p>The name \"blessings deck\" changed for a deeper\
  \ gameplay reason. In Rise of the Runelords, the name made perfect sense because\
  \ it only ever contained blessings. But in <em>Skull &amp; Shackles</em>, we shuffled\
  \ in the villain Brinebones. In <em>Wrath of the Righteous</em>, Khorramzadeh got\
  \ the same treatment. In <em>Mummy's Mask</em>, all sorts of things—Sandstorms,\
  \ Conflagrations, Forgotten Pharaoh Cultists, Sun Falcons, even scourges—ended up\
  \ there. So we needed a name for that deck that didn't imply that everything in\
  \ it was a blessing. We decided to focus on the deck's function as a timer, so we\
  \ named it the <b>hourglass</b>. Once we had that, it became much easier to talk\
  \ about <b>the hour</b> rather than \"the top card of the blessings discard pile.\"\
  \ And now nearly every blessing has a power that affects the turn while it's the\
  \ hour.</p> \n    <p>Once we got rid of \"blessings deck,\" the word <b>deck</b>\
  \ itself got an overhaul. We simplified \"location deck\" to just <b>location</b>.\
  \ (When we say \"examine the top card of your location,\" we don't think you'll\
  \ think of the card with the name of the location on it.) With those changes in\
  \ place, that means the word \"deck\" now refers solely to character's decks.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The concept of the \"adventure deck number\" has also been rethought.\
  \ It used to mean either of two very different things: \"the scenario's adventure\
  \ deck number\" has been replaced with the symbol <b>#</b>, while the number in\
  \ the upper right corner of a card is now the card's <b>level</b>. For example,\
  \ the Veteran bane Traitor has a difficulty to defeat of 9+##, meaning 9 plus twice\
  \ the number of the adventure you're playing. And his power increases the difficulty\
  \ of his check by the level of the ally you discard. Tricky guy.</p> \n    <p>And\
  \ now we can say things like \"if the hour's level is 0, reload,\" which is so much\
  \ better than \"if the top card of the blessings discard pile has an adventure deck\
  \ number of 0, put this card on top of your deck.\"</p> \n    <p>We've also borrowed\
  \ some tricks from <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/acg\">Pathfinder Society Adventure\
  \ Card Guild</a> and from Obsidian's <a href=\"https://pathfinder.obsidian.net\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Pathfinder Adventures</a> app. We cull cards adventure-by-adventure,\
  \ as we've been doing in PFS, and we do so by removing them from the <b>vault</b>,\
  \ a Pathfinder Adventures term that describes the subset of cards in the box you're\
  \ playing with right now.</p> \n    <p>And because we cull by level, we are able\
  \ to make a sweeping change: removing the traits Basic and Elite. These have been\
  \ on my hit list for a long time. New players would conflate Basic with \"Base Set\"\
  \ too often for my taste, and Elite never pulled its own weight. Now when you build\
  \ your starting deck, you do it with Level 0 cards. Easy.</p> \n    <p>We're aware\
  \ these changes will alter a small number of past cards on more than a cosmetic\
  \ level. Cards like Vestments of Authority and Named Bullet care about the Basic\
  \ and Elite traits, and now need to care about something else. Adamantine weapons\
  \ ignore powers that increase the difficulty of checks, but since the # concept\
  \ moves the difficulty increase out of the powers box and into the check itself,\
  \ those cards need a tweak to function properly. The rulebook includes brief conversion\
  \ notes that cover a lot of these cases, such as explaining that level 0 is the\
  \ new Basic. We are working on a short list of cards that need attention beyond\
  \ that, and we'll happily accept your help ferreting out any more.</p> \n    <p>Speaking\
  \ of new features in the rulebook, we've added a glossary that lists all of the\
  \ important game terms (more than 100 of them, can you believe?) along with page\
  \ references to tell you where to find the related rules. And when one of those\
  \ game terms is introduced, we bold it—just like we've done in this blog post—to\
  \ let you know it's a game term and to help you find it again later.</p> \n    <p>I've\
  \ run out of pixels for this blog, but I've still got a lot more to show you on\
  \ this subject. Next time I'll show you what we did with cards like characters,\
  \ spells, items, banes, and locations. I think you'll like what you see.</p> \n\

  \ changing, there is an important change to the front of the box: In addition to\
  \ \"A Game by Mike Selinker,\" each box now features the names of the designers\
  \ of that set. For Core and Curse, it's me, Chad Brown, Aviva Schecterson, Liz Spain,\
  \ and of course Keith Richmond. Credit well deserved, says me.</p> \n   </div> <!--\
