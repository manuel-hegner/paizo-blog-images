  \ Retrospective—Year 3 (2005)</h1> \n   <h2>Laying the Foundation</h2> \n   <p class=\"\
  date\">Thursday, May 31, 2012</p> \n   <p class=\"tiny\" align=\"center\"><i>This\
  \ blog entry is the fourth in a series of blogs commemorating Paizo's 10th anniversary.<br><a\
  \ href=\"/paizo/blog/2012/february/v5748dyo5ld43\">Click here to read the first\
  \ installment</a>.</i></p> \n   <p>At the start of 2005, the loss of our friends\
  \ and co-workers who had worked on <i>Undefeated</i> and <i>Amazing Stories</i>\
  \ still lay heavily on our hearts, but the feeling in the company that we had already\
  \ hit bottom and there was nowhere left to go but upward was oddly hopeful. Nevertheless,\
  \ there was a lot of revenue that still needed to be made up for from the loss of\
  \ <i>Star Wars Insider</i> a year and a half earlier. If we were going to be <i>just</i>\
  \ the <i>Dragon</i> and <i>Dungeon</i> magazine company, we would still need to\
  \ get much leaner, which would mean more layoffs—something none of us wanted to\
  \ go through again. Instead of retreating, we needed to secure new territory.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>In January, the top managers in the company met at my house. The goal\
  \ was to find new uses for Paizo's existing people and skills, with an eye toward\
  \ quickly increasing revenue. Instead of focusing on actual product ideas at this\
  \ meeting, we were looking for broad categories of things we were already good at.\
  \ Here are the strategies we devised that afternoon:</p> \n   <ol>\n    <li>Use\
  \ our strong position in the distribution chain to help other publishers get their\
  \ products into game stores, taking a bit off the top for our efforts.</li> \n \
  \   <li>Increase paizo.com sales by expanding the scope of products available on\
  \ the website through partnerships with other publishers, who would in turn bring\
  \ in new customers for us.</li> \n    <li>Expand our license for <i>Dragon</i> and\
  \ <i>Dungeon</i> to create official non-magazine Dungeons &amp; Dragons products—\
  especially those we could base on in-demand but out-of-print material from the magazines.</li>\
  \ \n    <li>Create generic gaming accessories that would appeal to our RPG customers.</li>\
  \ \n    <li>Expand Paizo into areas of gaming outside of RPGs that would spread\
  \ our risk around.</li> \n    <div class=\"blurb180\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/20120531-Blog5.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/20120531-Blog5_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n  \
  \   <br> The tower of Shackled City hardcovers at Gen Con was as tall as some of\
  \ our customers!\n    </div> \n    <li>Expand our subscriber base for <i>Dragon</i>\
  \ and <i>Dungeon</i> while continuing to make those businesses more efficient.</li>\n\
  \   </ol> \n   <p>With those in place, we next had a brainstorm session with the\
  \ entire Paizo staff to come up with some product ideas that might fit those strategies.\
  \ A key rule of brainstorming is that you don't critique any ideas at first; you\
  \ just write them down and discuss them later... so everything got recorded for\
  \ posterity: the good, the bad, and the ugly. (See below for the results of our\
  \ brainstorm.) Some of these ideas came to fruition, including the compilation of\
  \ comic strips, the DM Workbook (which turned into our <a href=\"/products/btpy7fiz\"\
  >Campaign Workbook</a>), preprinted plastic/vinyl maps (which evolved into the <a\
  \ href=\"/gameMastery/maps\">Flip-Mat line</a>), and a few others. Some were just\
  \ plain silly, like LARPing with paintball rules, the swimsuit edition, minted Greyhawk\
  \ coins (though the <a href=\"/store/gameAids/other/campaignCoins\">GameMastery\
  \ Campaign Coins</a> line comes close), cereal bowls, and replica D&amp;D artifacts.\
  \ (That last one, and some of the others, also involved a lot of wishful thinking\
  \ about things that our license with Wizards of the Coast didn't even <i>begin</i>\
  \ to cover.) </p> \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/20120531-Blog10.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/20120531-Blog10_360.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n \
  \  </div> \n   <p>Now that we had a plan, we spent the rest of 2005 executing it.\
  \ The most visible result was probably our first two hardcover books. <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy7dx9\">The Shackled City hardcover</a> compiled the first-ever Adventure\
  \ Path into a huge 416-page book. Magazines have a short shelf-life by design, and\
  \ The Shackled City was originally spread across 11 non-consecutive issues of a\
  \ magazine that was still bimonthly at the start, so the first chapters of the AP\
  \ had already been out of print for over 2 years. Because D&amp;D 3.5 had been released\
  \ during this time, we also needed to update the first few chapters from 3.0. We\
  \ generally fine-tuned things throughout based on customer feedback, and we even\
  \ had Chris Perkins write a whole new adventure to fill an XP gap. James Jacobs\
  \ slaved away many an evening—on top of his normal <i>Dungeon</i> duties—getting\
  \ this book ready to go. We released it just before Gen Con, and had a huge stack\
  \ of them for sale at our booth.</p> \n   <div class=\"blurb180\">\n    <a href=\"\
  /image/content/Blog/20120531-Blog7.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/20120531-Blog7_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    <br> The full <a href=\"/dungeon/products/issues/greyhawkmap\"\
  >Greyhawk map from Dungeon 118–121</a>.\n   </div> \n   <p>At the end of the year,\
  \ The Shackled City's sister book was released. The <a href=\"/products/btpy7dxa\"\
  ><i>Dragon Compendium Volume 1</i></a> (yep—we had hoped to release additional volumes\
  \ in subsequent years) compiled some of the top articles from the long history of\
  \ <i>Dragon</i> magazine, updated to 3.5 where necessary. Erik Mona spent many an\
  \ evening going through the entire <i>Dragon</i> archive and tagging pages for future\
  \ reference. To this day, our archive copies have those little tags sticking out\
  \ of the top of every issue, a testament to how thorough Erik was in his task!</p>\
  \ \n   <p>We brought <i>Dungeon</i> one of the most highly anticipated events of\
  \ its history at the beginning of 2005. Back in the days of Team Greyhawk at Wizards\
  \ of the Coast, we had begun making the Greyhawk map to end all Greyhawk maps. We\
  \ pored through every Greyhawk source we could find and made sure every single location\
  \ ever mentioned was on the map. Sadly, the project was shelved at the time. However,\
  \ when Paizo was looking for something to help raise awareness of the new and improved\
  \ <i>Dungeon</i>, we hit upon the idea of breaking that enormous map into four parts,\
  \ which we released in consecutive issues. <i>Dungeon</i> #118–121 ended up being\
  \ some of the most popular and best-selling issues in the magazine's history.</p>\
  \ \n   <div class=\"blurb180\">\n    <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/20120531-Blog6.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/20120531-Blog6_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n  \
  \  <br> The Age of Worms Adventure Path kicked off in 2005.\n   </div> \n   <p>Another\
  \ big change for <i>Dungeon</i> was making the Adventure Path a monthly feature.\
  \ Beginning with Erik Mona's now infamous adventure \"The Whispering Cairn\" in\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy7ym6?Dungeon-Issue-124\"><i>Dungeon</i> 124</a>, the new\
  \ <a href=\"/dungeon/products/issues/ageOfWorms\">Age of Worms AP</a> brought new\
  \ stories every single month, climaxing in the demigod Kyuss's attempt to enter\
  \ the world of Oerth. From that point in July 2005 onward, we've scheduled a new\
  \ Adventure Path installment every single month!</p> \n   <p><i>Dragon</i> didn't\
  \ have any earth-shattering events in 2005, just a refinement of the changes we'd\
  \ debuted at the previous Gen Con. A couple of regular articles in particular had\
  \ become reader favorites: One was James Jacobs's \"Demonomicon of Iggwilv\" articles,\
  \ delving into the details of D&amp;D's biggest bads. Fraz-Urb'luu and Zuggtmoy\
  \ had their fiendish plans unveiled in <a href=\"/products/btpy7y9x\">issues #333</a>\
  \ and <a href=\"/products/btpy7ufi\">#337</a> respectively. We started Sean K Reynolds's\
  \ \"Core Beliefs\" series, which covered Greyhawk deities in the same depth that\
  \ Faiths and Pantheons had brought to the Realms gods. We also started the \"Worm\
  \ Food\" series, providing information especially useful to folks playing though\
  \ the Age of Worms Adventure Path running over in <i>Dungeon</i>.</p> \n   <p>While\
  \ our first two hardcovers were certainly the stars of the 2005 lineup, we also\
  \ launched another line of products which has been much more prolific over the intervening\
  \ years. GameMastery was envisioned as a line that would provide GMs with a wealth\
  \ of tools that they could use to augment their ongoing campaigns. Our first product\
  \ was the <a href=\"/store/games/miniatures/miniaturesForRoleplaying/compleatEncounters\"\
  >Compleat Encounter</a> line, which brought to reality an idea I'd had for years.\
  \ In my own campaigns, I struggle when my players have random encounters that turn\
  \ out to be more substantial than an orc or two. I'd always wanted a line of products\
  \ that would give you a map, a couple of miniatures, and a mini-adventure that you\
  \ could just plop into your campaign. I really wanted the miniatures to be prepainted\
  \ plastic, but that was beyond our capabilities. My good friend Bob Watts (formerly\
  \ at Grenadier, Heartbreaker, Ral Partha, and Games Workshop) helped Paizo create\
  \ our first unpainted metal miniatures by getting us in touch with the best sculptors,\
  \ painters, mold makers, and miniatures spinners. All we needed was somebody to\
  \ draw the maps and write the adventures.</p> \n   <p>For the first two releases,\
  \ we turned to longtime <i>Dungeon</i> cartographer Chris West for the maps. Wayne\
  \ Reynolds provided us with design sketches for minis that we turned over to sculptors\
  \ Neil McKenzie and Dennis Mize. And Mike Mearls wrote the adventures, using one\
  \ of our spare desks as his part-time office. Dark Elf Sanctum and Death Shrine\
  \ of the Ninja Cult released in September and October, and saw pretty good sales\
  \ for a miniatures product. In the subsequent months, further Compleat Encounters\
  \ were written by James Jacobs, Keith Strohm, Jason Bulmahn, and Sean K Reynolds,\
  \ with Corey Macourek contributing maps and Andrew Hou designing minis. Some of\
  \ the villains that would become iconic in the not-yet-even-dreamed-of Pathfinder\
  \ campaign setting saw their births in this line, including the Whispering Tyrant\
  \ and the Gorilla King. Ultimately, though, the line was more effort than it was\
  \ really worth, and because the cost of metal for making the miniatures skyrocketed\
  \ that winter, we decided to end the line in April 2006. (For trivia buffs, this\
  \ line provided three of the very few Paizo products that were cancelled after being\
  \ officially announced: Fane of the Black Adept, which would have been written by\
  \ Wes Schneider; and Stand &amp; Deliver and War Golem Factory, which hadn't been\
  \ assigned to writers.)</p> \n   <div class=\"blurb180\">\n    <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/20120531-Blog8.jpg\"\

  \  <br> <a href=\"/products/btpy7ux6\">Compleat Encounter: Dark Elf Sanctum</a>\
  \ was the first GameMastery product.\n    <br>\n    <br><a href=\"/image/content/Blog/20120531-Blog9.jpg\"\

  \  <br> <a href=\"/products/btpy8kqu\">Map Pack: Village</a> kicks off this popular\
  \ GameMastery product line.\n   </div> \n   <p>The other GameMastery line that debuted\
  \ that year, Map Packs, have done quite a bit better for us. We kicked off the line\
  \ in November 2005 with the now sold-out <a href=\"/products/btpy8kqu\">Map Pack:\
  \ Village</a>. Using the same 5\" x 7\" map tile configuration that we created for\
  \ the Compleat Encounter line, Map Packs were envisioned as a tool that GMs could\
  \ use on the fly, giving them high-quality graphics to replace the marker scribblings\
  \ most of us manage on our own. The fact that we've just released our 37th Map Pack\
  \ shows you just how successful this product line has been!</p> \n   <p>In an effort\
  \ to expand Paizo's business into other types of games, we announced the formation\
  \ of Titanic Games at Gen Con. Titanic Games found its genesis at the same con the\
  \ previous year when Bob Watts and I were talking with Cheapass Games proprietor\
  \ James Ernest. James had built an entire business around the premise that folks\
  \ tend to have all the bits and pieces they need for most games—dice, pawns, and\
  \ such—so he could provide high-value games at low cost by supplying only the unique\
  \ parts—usually, rules, game boards, and cards, printed in black-and-white on thick\
  \ paper, with clip-art illustrations, often packaged in an unassuming envelope.\
  \ Titanic Games started with the idea of flipping that premise back around—bringing\
  \ high production values to some of the most popular Cheapass Games. Of course,\
  \ we announced that we'd be starting with the number one game in the Cheapass portfolio,\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy8ar0\">Kill Doctor Lucky</a>. James, along with fellow\
  \ designer Mike Selinker, had a few non-Cheapass ideas kicking around too, including\
  \ one that we thought could be a real game changer... but that story will have to\
  \ wait until 2006.</p> \n   <p>We also took our first shot at using our existing\
  \ distribution chain to help out other companies in 2005. Order of the Stick creative\
  \ guru Rich Burlew had already produced two printed compilations of his webcomic\
  \ early in 2005, and they'd quickly sold out and already needed to be reprinted.\
  \ Rich had found that sending out all of those books was taking time and effort\
  \ that he really wanted to direct back to drawing his strips, so he was open to\
  \ working with us to handle those things for him. We announced our partnership in\
  \ September, along with the news that Order of the Stick would now appear monthly\
  \ in <i>Dragon</i>. We had similar deals in the works with other companies; we'll\
  \ talk about those in the 2006 blog.</p> \n   <p>The paizo.com online store really\
  \ started to take off in 2005. We created several strategic relationships with manufacturers\
  \ and publishers that wanted to get their products into the hands of the growing\
  \ <i>Dragon</i> and <i>Dungeon</i> customer base. In 2005, among the most successful\
  \ were a variety of T-shirt manufacturers who began to offer their funny and geeky\
  \ designs through paizo.com. We also began selling PDFs of Paizo issues of <i>Dragon</i>\
  \ and <i>Dungeon</i> in March, and added our first third-party PDF publisher, <a\
  \ href=\"/store/byCompany/r/roninArts\">Ronin Arts</a>, in May. And we alerted gamers\
  \ to the trove of products available at paizo.com by adding a few catalog pages\
  \ to the back of <i>Dragon</i>. By the end of the year, paizo.com online sales had\
  \ beaten 2004 by more than 500%.</p> \n   <p>At Gen Con, Paizo made our return to\
  \ the ENnie Awards, raking in 4 gold awards and a silver. The awards received were:</p>\
  \ \n   <blockquote> \n    <p>Best Cartography—Gold ENnie: World of Greyhawk 4-part\

  \ <i>CEO</i></p> \n   <br> \n   <h2>James Sutter: The Little Intern That Could</h2>\
  \ \n   <p>First off, let's set something straight: I started working for Paizo in\
  \ 2004, not 2005. Sure, I may not have had a desk, or technically been inside the\
  \ office more than a handful of times. And maybe only Lisa knew my name. But I was\
  \ there, dang it!</p> \n   <p>In fall 2004, I was 20 years old. I had graduated\
  \ from the University of Washington the previous spring, and was scraping by via\
  \ a combination of freelance journalism for local papers, teaching SAT prep courses\
  \ to high school kids, and a chunk of change gained by getting my butt kicked on\
  \ Wheel of Fortune (a story in itself). Having already realized that I didn't want\
  \ to spend my life covering obituaries and little league games, I was searching\
  \ the classified ads for some sort of magazine job when I ran across a listing for\
  \ the Editor-in-Chief of <i>Amazing Stories</i>. The realization that such an important\
  \ SF magazine—not to mention <i>Dragon</i> and <i>Dungeon</i>—was located just a\
  \ few miles from where I was living clinched it: I needed to work at Paizo Publishing.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>The only problem was that there was no way I was qualified for the Editor-in-Chief\
  \ position. So instead, I emailed folks at the company trying to find out if perhaps\
  \ there were any other positions that needed filling—things they hadn't got around\
  \ to posting yet. Eventually I ended up talking to Lisa, and she brought me into\
  \ the old office (now the old-old office) for an interview.</p> \n   <p>Before this\
  \ blog results in a flood of people asking Lisa for a job, I should emphasize that\
  \ I already had a pretty solid portfolio at this point—I'd sold more than a hundred\
  \ articles to various papers, and had a few short stories published in fiction 'zines.\
  \ In any case, Lisa looked at my credentials, and told me that while there were\
  \ no editorial positions open, she thought she could find something for me.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Which is how I ended up collecting images for products on the newborn\
  \ paizo.com web store at a nickel a jpg. Hardly the most glamorous position, but\
  \ every time I walked into the office to pick up a check, I would look over at the\
  \ side of the office with the big <i>Amazing Stories</i> banner and think, \"Someday,\
  \ I'm going to have a desk there.\"</p> \n   <p>It turned out I was right. After\
  \ several months of contract work, Lisa brought me in as Paizo's very first Editorial\
  \ Intern. The position even came with a desk in the <i>Amazing Stories</i> side\
  \ of the building!</p> \n   <p>Except that, unknown to me, the entire staff of <i>Amazing\
  \ Stories</i> and <i>Undefeated</i> had been laid off a few weeks prior. The banner\
  \ was still there, right above my desk—but now all the other desks were empty. I\
  \ was alone in a cubicle wasteland.</p> \n   <p>Still, it didn't matter—I was officially\
  \ on the inside now. Wes Schneider, himself the youngest person at Paizo until I\
  \ came along, was the first of the editorial team to make the long walk across the\
  \ building and introduce himself, exposing me to a wide array of internet humor\
  \ in an effort to determine my taste. Slowly the other editors—a generally shy and\
  \ skittish lot—began to get to know me as well, and I ceased to be just \"that kid,\"\
  \ instead becoming \"Sutter.\" </p> \n   <p>There were still tests, though. On one\
  \ of my first days as an intern, Erik Mona walked over and threw a manuscript down\
  \ on my desk.</p> \n   <p>\"I hear you want to edit,\" he said. \"Let's see what\
  \ you've got.\"</p> \n   <p>I agreed happily, and asked who wrote the document.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"I did,\" he said. </p> \n   <p>The mystery manuscript? Erik's first\
  \ draft of \"The Whispering Cairn,\" the leadoff adventure in the Age of Worms Adventure\
  \ Path. Sweating bullets, I put my head down and began to edit.</p> \n   <p>Fortunately\
  \ for me, Erik found my comments worthwhile, or at least respected a newbie bold\
  \ enough to question his comma usage. I was judged competent, and turned loose on\
  \ the Shackled City hardcover, my first real project. Though still working my newspaper\
  \ and teaching jobs in the evenings, I was elated.</p> \n   <p>Nothing lasts forever,\
  \ though. Six months into my internship, management informed me that they were going\
  \ to bring me on full-time—as the new customer service person! (Back in the day,\
  \ this was considered a one-person job.)</p> \n   <p>I thanked them, but pointed\
  \ out that I was perfectly happy as the editorial intern. They pointed out that\
  \ they needed customer service, not interns.</p> \n   <p>So began a six-month stint\
  \ as Paizo's only customer service specialist. I learned a lot about psychology\
  \ and human nature in those months, talking people down from canceling their subscriptions,\
  \ sending out replacement copies, and helping Jeff Alvarez set up our very first\
  \ warehouse in the building's basement. But my dream of being an editor hadn't died—\
  and in fact came to a head late that year when a local paper began feeling me out\
  \ for a position as the features editor. Not wanting to leave Paizo, but fearing\
  \ a missed opportunity, I told Lisa and Erik—and as of the dawn of 2006, I was <i>Dungeon</i>'s\
  \ new Assistant Editor. </p> \n   <p>(As it turns out, my replacement as the customer\
  \ service department was this weird guy from Idaho named—I kid you not—\"Cosmo.\"\
  \ If you've had to deal with him in the years since, I apologize. I trained him\
  \ as best I could, but some creatures just refuse to be housebroken.)</p> \n   <p>Not\
  \ even old enough to drink when I started here—Wes was actually present at my 21st\
  \ birthday—I've spent more than a quarter of my life working for Paizo. I spent\
  \ years learning what was cool at the feet of Wes, Jacobs, and Erik, while simultaneously\
  \ fascinating them with my post-collegiate bohemian lifestyle. (I swear, you eat\
  \ out of a few dumpsters, and you never hear the end of it.) I published my first\
  \ adventure—\"Shut-In\" from <a href=\"/products/btpy7xt5\"><i>Dungeon</i> #128</a>,\
  \ co-written with Wes Schneider—and used the money to buy my very own copies of\
  \ the 3.5 rulebooks. I earned the nickname \"The Render\" from freelancers for my\
  \ uncompromising evaluation of the slush pile. And I was at ground zero for several\
  \ of the pivotal points yet to come in Paizo's history, in which we were forced\
  \ to adapt radically or die.</p> \n   <p>But it wasn't all work. There was also\
  \ the Independent Republic of Jamesonia, established when Jacobs and I placed masking\
  \ tape across the entrance to our shared cube (the one whose window looked out on\
  \ a primordial swamp). There were the impromptu puppet shows whenever Jacobs got\
  \ distracted by his pile of stuffed Lovecraft monsters. There was Operation Banjo\
  \ Thug, an impromptu musical performance from Jacobs and me that caused Wes—the\
  \ only witness—to question his sanity. There was the time I turned orange for a\
  \ few months, and the long drive to a cabin in the woods with Wes and Jacobs that\
  \ resulted in Jacobs calling me \"Caligula\" for several years.</p> \n   <p>It's\
  \ been a long time since those early days. I'm not even \"Young Master Sutter\"\
  \ at Paizo anymore—in the editorial department, the new youngster is Patrick \"\
  P-Ren\" Renie, who no doubt seems just as alien to us with his youthful ways and\
  \ speech patterns as I did to the other staff once upon a time. From website image-monkey\
  \ to Senior Editor, I've seen Paizo from just about every angle, and I'm proud to\
  \ say that we really are a family. A weird one, to be sure, but aren't they all?</p>\

  \   <h2>Cosmo's Place in the Cosmos</h2> \n   <p>\"We have to get you out of Idaho,\"\
  \ he said. It was late summer 2005 and my week's vacation in Seattle was coming\
  \ to a close. Josh Frost, with whom I've been friends since grade school, was lamenting\
  \ my impending return to our hometown where, we both agreed, I was stuck.</p> \n\
  \   <p>\"Then find me a job.\" It was the same refrain I'd given to all of my Seattle\
  \ friends that week when the question of my living situation came up.</p> \n   <p>2005\
  \ was not a very good year for me. I was living in small-town Idaho, working a job\
  \ I hated with few prospects for the future. I made a decent enough paycheck to\
  \ be comfortable, but I was desperate to get out and short on options.</p> \n  \
  \ <p>Two months passed before I received word from Josh: \"We have an opening at\
  \ Paizo for a customer service position. Send me your resume. Now.\"</p> \n   <p>I\
  \ knew that Josh worked for some company in the gaming industry, but I had never\
  \ heard of Paizo. What I did know, though, was customer service, something I had\
  \ been doing in one form or another for nearly 10 years. I sent my resume, and immediately\
  \ went out and bought a copy of <i>Dragon</i> (<a href=\"/products/btpy7ya3\">issue\
  \ #338</a>, by the way) so I would not be completely clueless if they called me.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>They called, and I had one of the strangest interviews I've ever had.\
  \ Phone interviews are never easy, and I was shocked to discover that, in addition\
  \ to being interviewed by my potential manager, Jeff Alvarez, I was also being interviewed\
  \ by the CEO of the entire company. For a customer service position. </p> \n   <p>This\
  \ was my first clue that the job would not be like any other. </p> \n   <p>That\
  \ year, I had Christmas with my family in Idaho. The next day, I loaded as much\
  \ as I could into the 1995 Geo Storm that I had bought for $100, and drove to my\
  \ new life in Seattle. The day after that, I started my new job at Paizo.</p> \n\
  \   <p>Sometime in my first month, I was taking everyone's mail around to their\
  \ desks. I still did not really know any of these delightful weirdos that I worked\
  \ with, and I was always intimidated about going into \"The Pit.\" As I quietly\
  \ crept in, I saw that all the editors were huddled together discussing something\
  \ very intently, and there was a definite air of \"meeting\" in the room. I tried\
  \ not to make a sound, so as to not disturb them. Then I started overhearing what\
  \ the meeting was about:</p> \n   <p>\"No... if the barbarian goes unconscious,\
  \ then the rage ends and the temporary hit points are lost!\"</p> \n   <p>\"...but\
  \ that means that any time a barbarian goes into the negs, they just auto-die?!?\
  \ That can't be right.\"</p> \n   <p>The discussion wound on, and I quietly finished\
  \ distributing the mail and went back to my desk, silently giggling over the absurd\
  \ luck that had brought me to this place. It was precisely at this point that I\
  \ realized that I loved my new job. </p> \n   <p>The thing I was most unprepared\
  \ for, I think, was the level of empowerment I had. My last job was as a bank teller,\
  \ where my responsibility was to toe the company line and make the customer accept\
  \ whatever rules and policies were dictated to me. Rules were handed down from on\
  \ high, and I was to follow without question.</p> \n   <p>Not so at Paizo. From\
  \ the get-go, I was being asked \"What do you think?\" And my ideas were considered,\
  \ and implemented if they stood up to the consideration. I could, and would, cry\
  \ foul if I saw something that I felt was confusing to customers, and I was listened\
  \ to. At previous jobs, if I ever felt that one of our customers had gotten a raw\
  \ deal, I would approach management to make it right and just get shot down. At\
  \ Paizo, if I find something wrong, Jeff's answer is \"Well... fix it! Make it right.\"\
  \ </p> \n   <p>For my first year or so, I was the only customer service person at\
  \ Paizo, but I've never been the only one at Paizo doing customer service. I was\
  \ (and still am) always getting ninja'd on the messageboards by Lisa or Vic, or\
  \ any number of other folks. I had thrown my lot in with this strange little company\
  \ where an entire culture of customer service made me, the low-man on the totem\
  \ pole, feel like I was a key member of a team. </p> \n   <p>It was awesome. It\
  \ still is awesome. </p> \n   <p>Cosmo Eisele<br> <i>Customer Service Manager</i></p>\
