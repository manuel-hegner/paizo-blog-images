  \    </div> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">We're almost out of the <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9y9m?Pathfinder-Battles-Jungle-of-Despair\"><em>Jungle of Despair</em></a>,\
  \ but we've still got two more previews to go. This week, we look at four winged\
  \ inhabitants of our jungle, before we tie up all the loose ends next week.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>First on the agenda this week is the pixie, a wild fey prankster sure\
  \ to add a bit of annoying fun to any campaign. A Small common figure, the pixie\
  \ should have a few of his friends with him for anyone opening a brick or a case,\
  \ allowing for all sorts of pixie swarm shenanigans. Though larger than the atomie\
  \ and other tiny winged fey, the pixie figure can also stand in for a number of\
  \ similar creatures if you're ok with the size discrepancies.</p> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180402-Pixie.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180402-Pixie_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Next we have the river drake, a lesser dragon that makes\
  \ a great challenge as the adventurers sail or steam into the heart of the jungle.\
  \ Perhaps one of the most versatile figures in the set, the river drake is at home\
  \ along rivers in all sorts of environments, and there are very few adventures I\
  \ can think of that don't involve a river of some sort, even if just as background.\
  \ The river drake is a Medium common figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180402-RiverDrake_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>This week's third offering is the batlike sabosan, echolocating\
  \ monstrous humanoids found in warm forests and in the deep caverns of the earth.\
  \ The sabosan miniature can also stand in for a werebat, or in a pinch, even a winged\
  \ demon or devil. Its massive wingspan makes it an imposing figure, even on a Medium\
  \ base, and its common rarity means you can throw a handful of them at the players\
  \ to really keep them on their toes.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n   \
  \  <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180402-Sabosan.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180402-Sabosan_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Players of the <a href=\"/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/serpentsSkull\"\
  >Serpent's Skull Adventure Path</a> will surely remember one of the campaign's most\
  \ iconic winged adversaries, which we'd be remiss not to include in this set. The\
  \ bane of goats and unsuspecting travelers everywhere, the winged chupacabra is\
  \ a thing of legend. More dangerous than the standard, wingless chupacabra, this\
  \ Medium uncommon figure is sure to be the highlight of any adventure it appears\
  \ in.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180402-WingedChupacabra.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180402-WingedChupacabra_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Thus we end our penultimate entry in the safari journal\
  \ of the <em>Jungle of Despair</em>. Next week we'll take a look at the final three\
  \ figures, locked in the eternal struggle between good and evil, and after that,\
  \ maybe a look at the next set on the horizon. <em>Jungle of Despair</em> is out\
  \ next month, so make sure to get your preorders in soon!</p> \n    <p>Mark Moreland<br>\
