  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Monday, March 13, 2017</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"\
  > \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Hi Pathfinders! Early last year, we released\
  \ the <a href=\"/pathfindersociety/rpg/clarifications\">Campaign Clarifications</a>\
  \ document, which gave us on the Pathfinder Society team a way to answer rules questions\
  \ and to adapt some rules to better fit the needs of an organized play campaign.\
  \ When we put out the document, I asked the forums to tell us which rules questions\
  \ have caused issues in their games. You all gave us a bunch of excellent feedback\
  \ and we continue to keep an eye on the clarifications threads for new questions\
  \ that crop up.</p> \n    <p>However, we ran into a bit of an issue. Campaign Clarifications\
  \ works well for questions that involve a single rule from one book, but it's equipped\
  \ to handle questions over multiple sources. We made lists of these more general\
  \ questions and answered some of them Season 8's version of the <a href=\"/products/btpy84k4\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild Guide</em></a>, but we wanted to limit\
  \ the guide to only the most broadly applicable information. As a side note, Guide\
  \ 8.1 is still in the works and we'll address some of the questions in that update.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>In order to answer the remaining questions, we knew we'd need to make\
  \ a significant update to our FAQ. We also wanted to clean out information that\
  \ was already answered in the guide, or that was no longer accurate, as well as\
  \ gather the forum posts from John, Tonya, and myself that had been serving as unofficial\
  \ suggestions. Today's update has been a long time in the making, and I'm happy\
  \ to present it to you all today.</p> \n    <p>So, what's changed? I'll go through\
  \ some of the highlights by section. Please read the full FAQ entries for any of\
  \ the changes below that interest you.</p> \n    <h3>Organized Play Events</h3>\
  \ \n    <ul>\n     <li>Creating More Events: The instructions for creating and reporting\
  \ events now take Core mode games and Adventure Card Guild games into account.</li>\n\
  \    </ul> \n    <h3>Roleplaying Guild General Questions</h3> \n    <ul>\n     <li>Required\
  \ Materials: There were some questions about what players needed to bring to the\
  \ table in order to use material from a book other than the <em>Core Rulebook</em>.\
  \ We cleaned up the language in the FAQ entry on legal sources to make some lesser-known\
  \ options more obvious.</li> \n     <li>Factions for pregenerated characters: You\
  \ can now earn faction rewards when playing pregenerated characters, as if they\
  \ were a member of the faction of the character who is receiving credit for the\
  \ adventure.</li> \n     <li>Caster level and spellcasting services: We've tightened\
  \ up the rules on the caster level for spellcasting services, specifying which ones\
  \ you can purchase at higher than minimum caster levels.</li>\n    </ul> \n    <h3>Wealth\
  \ and Treasure</h3> \n    <ul>\n     <li>Poisons: the list of available poisons\
  \ from the <em>Core Rulebook</em> has been expanded.</li> \n     <li>Upgrading Magic\
  \ Items: We've expanded the rules for upgrading magic items to allow some upgrades\
  \ that do more than increase a number.</li> \n     <li>Intelligent Items: You can\
  \ carry more than one intelligent item at a time, and 1st level characters are never\
  \ at risk of dying from picking up an intelligent item during an adventure.</li>\
  \ \n     <li>Alternative Ammunition: We've created a blanket rule to allows you\
  \ to purchase magical ammunition listed on a Chronicle sheet as a different form\
  \ of ammunition; for example, buying <i>+1 frost shuriken</i> when the chronicle\
  \ lists <i>+1 frost bolts</i>.</li> \n     <li>Scrolls: We've cleared up the rules\
  \ around scrolls, such as codifying their arcane spell failure chance, the rules\
  \ for scrolls with multiple spells, and the rules for determining which ability\
  \ score is appropriate to use when activating a scroll with the Use Magic Device\
  \ skill.</li>\n    </ul> \n    <h3>Character Questions</h3> \n    <ul>\n     <li>Race-Specific\
  \ Options: We've clarified the rules around the Racial Heritage feat from the <em>Advanced\
  \ Player's Guide</em> and other options that allow characters to take options initially\
  \ written for other races.</li> \n     <li>Legal Abilities Referencing Ones That\
  \ Aren't: We've clarified what happens if your archetype or other class ability\
  \ grants you an option that does not appear in <a href=\"/pathfindersociety/rpg/additional\"\
  >Additional Resources</a>.</li> \n     <li>Spell Study: We've expanded the rules\
  \ around learning spells from NPCs and filling spellbooks to make it clear that\
  \ such actions are not restricted only to wizards.</li>\n    </ul> \n    <h3>Character\
  \ Companions</h3> \n    <ul>\n     <li>How Many Companions: The FAQ and the latest\
  \ version of the <em>Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild Guide</em> disagreed with\
  \ each other about the rules for how many creatures a character can bring to the\
  \ table and use at one time. We've updated the FAQ to more closely align with the\
  \ Guide.</li> \n     <li>Animal Companions and Shields: We've explicitly added shields\
  \ to the list of tools that animal companions cannot use.</li> \n     <li>Retraining\
  \ Companions: We've added rules for retraining your companion creature's abilities\
  \ and replacing a companion's tricks with different ones.</li> \n     <li>Companions\
  \ and Boons: We've added the rule from John's forum post describing what happens\
  \ if a companion creature gains a boon during an adventure.</li> \n     <li>Improved\
  \ Familiars (Work in Progress): We have not yet updated the entry about which familiars\
  \ have which item slots and which familiars can use wands and other magic items.\
  \ An update for this entry is in the works, with the help of a team of Venture-Officers,\
  \ but it will take some time to pull it all together.</li>\n    </ul> \n    <p>Do\
  \ you have any feedback about this update? What questions would you like to see\
  \ added in our next update to the FAQ? Let us know in the comments below.</p> \n\
