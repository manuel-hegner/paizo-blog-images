  > \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">As the Halloween weekend approaches, and fancy\
  \ dress parties loom on the very near horizon, I find myself getting a bit thirsty\
  \ for the cavalcade of beer and alcohol that's just around the corner. That brings\
  \ me, naturally, to <a href=\"/products/btpy9er4\"><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a>,\
  \ the next set of prepainted plastic <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder Battles</a>\
  \ gaming figures! The set, now scheduled for a January release, adopts a \"tavern\"\
  \ theme, with many of the figures in the set being appropriate for tavern-based\
  \ encounters and battles. Early reaction to news of the set had some folks worried\
  \ that maybe the set would include too much bar stuff, or too many NPCs, and over\
  \ the last several months worth of previews I've done my best to assuage those concerns\
  \ with previews of all manner of generally useful creatures and characters, whether\
  \ your heroes are in the tavern or not.</p> \n    <p>No more. By my count I have\
  \ six figures plus an updated and much-improved case incentive to preview, and all\
  \ but ONE of those figures fits hand-in-glove with the tavern theme. The outlier\
  \ figure will have to wait for next week, but I suggest all minis fans start chilling\
  \ their pint glasses immediately. There's some heavy drinking up ahead!</p> \n \
  \   <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20151030-Bartender.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20151030-Bartender_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Every good bar needs a Bartender, of course, and the\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9er4\"><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a> is no exception!\
  \ This sassy, saucy lady is more than happy to pour you a foamy brew or share rumors\
  \ from the local community—for the right-sized pile of coins, of course! I don't\
  \ know why, but I appreciate the fact that she's got a dishrag. Adventurers can\
  \ be such messy folk. The Bartender is a Medium, rare figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20151030-Table.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20151030-Table_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>I suppose the Bartender's dishrag might come in very\
  \ handy once adventurers make a mess on this table! Randomly inserted about one-per-case\
  \ in exchange for an uncommon figure, this Medium table is just one of a handful\
  \ of useful bits of dungeon dressing spread out through the set (others include\
  \ the previously previewed wagon, cart, and bed). I suspect a lot of folks would\
  \ appreciate more tables than just the one they're likely to get in the set. As\
  \ with the bed we previewed last week, I'll see what I can do about getting a promotional\
  \ repaint, but there is not currently one in the works. But there may be more news\
  \ on this in the next couple of weeks...</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n\
  \     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20151030-CaydenCailean.jpg\"><img\
  \ src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20151030-CaydenCailean_360.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>One of my favorite gods in the Pathfinder pantheon is Cayden\
  \ Cailean, god of beer, wine, freedom, and bravery. With a sword in one hand and\
  \ a frothy beer in the other, Cayden sometimes manifests in local bars to check\
  \ out new brews. Here we see him in mortal form—he became a living god by drunkenly\
  \ passing the Test of the Starstone. It just so happens that Cayden makes a GREAT\
  \ proxy for a drunken player character, or a short-term ally of the party who gets\
  \ them into trouble by always being a little too deep in his cups (or in his tankards,\
  \ as the case may be). I love the expression on his face, which came through great\
  \ on the paint master I saw a few weeks ago. What a wry bastard. Love him. Cayden\
  \ Cailean is a Medium, rare figure.</p> \n    <p>By my count, we've got one more\
  \ rare and two more pieces of dungeon dressing before we get to the grand finale!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Happy Halloween, everybody! See you at the bar!</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br>\
