  \ \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">No two characters worship the same way. How\
  \ and why they worship their deities are as varied as the player base of Paizo’\
  s organized play campaign. Many players choose for their characters to follow the\
  \ examples of several deities, seeing a personal connection between them that motivates\
  \ and inspires their journey. In some cases, adventuring parties form around one\
  \ of these custom pantheons, becoming regional memes that take on a life of their\
  \ own. Perhaps you have created a Pathfinder pantheon yourself?</p> \n     <p>Now\
  \ you have the chance.</p> \n     <p><em>Lost Omens: Gods &amp; Magic</em> introduced\
  \ us to a set of rules for creating and worshiping polytheistic pantheons. Developer\
  \ Luis Loza graciously showed us more examples in his blog post, <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh2v\"\
  >Friends in High Places</a>. The Know Direction Network in collaboration with the\
  \ Organized Play Team invites you to submit a brand-new pantheon, with the best\
  \ submission becoming a sanctioned option for the Pathfinder Society!</p> \n   \

  \ will be several stages to the contest. Upon receipt, Know Direction staff will\
  \ review all submissions for contest criteria compliance (say that five times fast).\
  \ After that, Know Direction judges will select their top pantheons from the anonymized\
  \ entries and send them to Paizo Organized Play staff, for vetting as potential\
  \ includees in the organized play program. From the vetted pool, the Know Direction\
  \ judges will select their favorites. Paizo will host a highlight blog about the\
  \ finalists and launch a period of voting by the public. Once voting closes, the\
  \ winner will be announced via blog post on paizo.com, invited to participate in\
  \ an episode of the Know Direction podcast, and the pantheon will be sanctioned\
  \ for use in the Pathfinder (second edition) Society.</p> \n     <p><b>Know Direction\
