  \ \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">No, we are not putting a scoop of ice cream\
  \ on top of every copy of the <em>Pathfinder Playtest Rulebook</em>, but we are\
  \ adding flavor to the different parts of the game. You've probably heard a lot\
  \ about it in the blogs and podcasts, but today we are dishing out a big scoop of\
  \ news on the different modes of play in the next evolution of Pathfinder!</p> \n\
  \    <p>Every moment in the game can be categorized into encounter mode, exploration\
  \ more, or downtime mode. The modes of play are governed by the needs of the adventure,\
  \ and the transition between them is ultimately up to the Game Master to decide.\
  \ You might be traveling through the woods, following the trail of the bandit queen,\
  \ which would be exploration mode, only to have the group thrust into encounter\
  \ mode as a combat breaks out with a pack of bloodthirsty wolves. Later, after defeating\
  \ the bandit queen, you might take your treasure back to town and take a week off,\
  \ entering downtime mode to craft a better suit of armor with your newfound wealth.</p>\

  ></a> \n     <p><i>Illustration by Wayne Reynolds</i></p>\n    </div> \n    <h2>Encounter\
  \ Mode</h2> \n    <p>Without a doubt, this is the most talked about part of the\
  \ game up to this point. Combat takes place exclusively in encounter mode, when\
  \ characters, villains, and monsters are locked in a life-or-death struggle, wielding\
  \ blades, claws, and spells to win the day. As we've mentioned elsewhere, encounter\
  \ mode functions much like it did in Pathfinder First Edition, with each round of\
  \ play taking 6 seconds of game time. You roll initiative at the start, putting\
  \ all of the combatants in order; each one takes a turn in initiative order, and\
  \ then you cycle through the combatants repeatedly until one side is victorious.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The changes we made to this system are intended to make play a little\
  \ easier to learn, while also giving you a wider array of choices as to how you\
  \ can take your turn. To start with, each character gets 3 actions on their turn.\
  \ While everyone has access to a list of basic actions, like stride (which lets\
  \ you move your speed), step (which lets you move just 5 feet, but without provoking\
  \ any reactions), and strike (which lets you make an attack), all characters have\
  \ special actions that they can take, derived from their ancestry, class, feat,\
  \ and gear choices.</p> \n    <p>For example, if you're playing a barbarian, you\
  \ can take a feat called Raging Courage that allows you to spend actions to shake\
  \ off being afraid, letting you get back into the fight. If you're playing a fighter,\
  \ you instead pick a feat called Intimidating Strike, which lets you spend 2 actions\
  \ to make an attack against a foe. If it hits, your enemy is frightened and flat-footed\
  \ until the end of your next turn! (Just don't use it on that barbarian.)</p> \n\
  \    <p>In addition to the 3 actions on your turn, you also get 1 reaction to use\
  \ anytime before the start of your next turn. The <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkm9?Fighter-Class-Preview\"\
  >fighter blog on Monday</a> mentioned the reaction attack of opportunity, which\
  \ allows you to take a free swing at foes that try to move around you or attempt\
  \ to cast spells adjacent to you, but fighters are not the only class to have fun\
  \ things to do with their reactions. The druid can gain a feat called Storm Retribution.\
  \ If you are a druid of the storm order and a foe critically hits you, this feat\
  \ allows you to unleash a powerful tempest on them in return, dealing 3d12 damage\
  \ and possibly pushing them away. Wizards, meanwhile, can get the ability to counterspell\
  \ with their reaction, canceling out enemy magic before it can even take effect.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The choices you make when building your character greatly influence what\
  \ you can do during combat. You can build a simpler character with a narrow field\
  \ of powerful choices, just as easily as a more complex character with a vast array\
  \ of options in a fight. As with the other modes of play, it's all up to you!</p>\
  \ \n    <h2>Exploration Mode</h2> \n    <p>If you are not in a combat, chances are\
  \ you are in exploration mode. This free-form part of the game allows characters\
  \ to take actions as needed to accomplish tasks, investigate problems, and interact\
  \ with other characters and the world around them. Travelling from place to place,\
  \ talking to a merchant lord, and swimming across a river to a mysterious island\
  \ are all part of exploration mode. Exploration mode is measured in minutes and\
  \ hours, depending on the task at hand and the flow of the game.</p> \n    <p>Skills\
  \ and skill feats govern a lot of what you can do in this part of the game, along\
  \ with your roleplaying and character backstory (as related to your background).\
  \ These options are available to all characters, and while some get more options\
  \ than others (like rogues), you can always focus on a few ways in which you can\
  \ shine.</p> \n    <p>Let's say you really want your sorcerer to be in tune with\
  \ nature. Not only could you put some of your proficiencies into the Nature skill,\
  \ giving you knowledge of the natural world, including plants and beasts, but you\
  \ could take skill feats that let you use Nature to heal people or even train an\
  \ animal, which can then help you on your journey. These opportunities are not unique\
  \ to any particular character. Anyone with the right proficiencies can select them.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>For long periods of exploration, characters focus on one task at a time\
  \ so it's easy for the GM to determine what rolls they make and how they're set\
  \ up for any challenges they face. This lets the game move quickly through long\
  \ journeys, then resume a more fine-grained pace when the party finds something\
  \ to investigate or encounters monsters or hazards.</p> \n    <p>What you do in\
  \ exploration mode can also influence how you enter combat. As you go on your adventures,\
  \ the Game Master will periodically ask you what you are doing, how you are traveling,\
  \ and what precautions you are taking as you venture into the unknown. These choices\
  \ influence what you roll when it's time to roll initiative. For most characters\
  \ it will be a Perception check, indicating how alert you were to the danger. If\
  \ instead you were trying to hide, you might roll Stealth, possibly allowing you\
  \ to start the combat unseen. If the fight is breaking out in the middle of a crowded\
  \ tavern, you might roll Diplomacy or Intimidation to get the upper hand, using\
  \ charm or a brutish manner to give you an edge. The GM makes the final determination\
  \ of what everyone rolls for initiative, and might allow you to choose between multiple\
  \ choices (one of which is typically Perception) if several options would make sense.</p>\
  \ \n    <h2>Downtime Mode</h2> \n    <p>Up to this point, we haven't talked much\
  \ about the downtime mode of play, where time passes quickly, allowing characters\
  \ to retrain, work at a profession, craft items, and more. Downtime mode is always\
  \ measured in days, allowing you to accomplish large tasks quickly in terms of time\
  \ at the table.</p> \n    <p>Just as with exploration mode, how you interact during\
  \ downtime mode is mostly up to you and the choices you make with your character.\
  \ If you are playing a bard with expert proficiency in Performance, you might spend\
  \ your downtime putting on shows in local taverns and for nearby nobles, earning\
  \ money to help fund your next adventure. With a few days and a decent roll, you\
  \ could easily afford an extra potion or two.</p> \n    <p>Let's say instead you\
  \ are playing a dwarven fighter who wants to make his own weapons. With the Craft\
  \ skill, you can make weapons of a quality up to your proficiency. Better yet, if\
  \ you pick up the Magical Crafter skill feat, your dwarven fighter could even make\
  \ magic weapons! This feat is available to anyone who is an expert crafter, making\
  \ the creation of magic items available to all. I should note that some items, like\
  \ scrolls and wands, do require you to be able to cast certain spells to create\
  \ them, though.</p> \n    <p>Finally, we have made retraining a core part of the\
  \ game, allowing you to trade out a feat, skill, or even class choice for another\
  \ equal option. Retraining occurs during downtime, and can take as little as a week,\
  \ giving you the flexibility to go on your next adventures with the right tools\
  \ to succeed.</p> \n    <p>Well, that's the scoop on this blog. I wish I could tell\
  \ you a bit about the Monday blog, but it succeeded at its Stealth check. You'll\
  \ just have to stop by then to find out what it is!</p> \n    <p>Jason Bulmahn<br>\
