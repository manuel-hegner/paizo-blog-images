  \    <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">PaizoCon\
  \ manages to land on near-perfect holiday weekends with bright and glorious sunshine\
  \ making the first signs of summer at the forefront of minds in the Pacific Northwest.\
  \ And as we all know, that means that convention season has begunâ€”with local cons,\
  \ big ones, and the Best 4 Days in Gaming (Gen Con) looming around the corner! I'm\
  \ taking a few minutes here at the nice and quiet (and empty) Paizo offices to give\
  \ those of you who didn't make it out the PaizoCon 2017 Preview Banquet last night\
  \ a glimpse of some of the fun you can expect this summer (and beyond!).</p> \n\

  \     </div> \n     <p>Last year you might remember <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5litw?Announcing-the-Starfinder-Roleplaying-Game\"\
  >we announced something pretty big</a>, and we didn't mess around this time: Starfinder\
  \ is coming! Space guns blazing, the massive <a href=\"/products/btpy9qy1\"><em>Starfinder\
  \ Core Rulebook</em></a> was in the spotlight of the preview banquet. Lots of information\
  \ came at us at lightspeed (and Jason Keeley made a truly amazing and landmark entrance\
  \ with a provisional copy of the <em>Core Rulebook</em>), and I'm even still processing\
  \ them all, but here are some key things of note:</p> \n     <ul>\n      <li>All\
  \ seven iconics and the core races were introduced by Senior Developer Rob McCreary,\
  \ and you can expect the series of backstories and class introductions on the Paizo\
  \ blog to resume soon after we wrap up the show.</li> \n      <li>Each race receives\
  \ a detailed write up with a plethora of options and ideas for player chracters,\
  \ with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/paizo/status/868675250292051968/photo/1\" target=\"\
  _blank\">pretty gorgeous introductory spreads</a>.</li> \n      <li>Each class gets\
  \ a similar treatment in the <em>Core Rulebook</em>, with easy to reference features\
  \ and statistics to flesh out your own custom build. What I really like about each\
  \ class writeup are the character theme options in the back of each class section\
  \ to give you a place to kick off your next character idea. The preview last night\
  \ featured operative class samples like the hacker, investigator, theif, and trailblazer.</li>\
  \ \n      <li>Development Coordinator Amanda Hamon Kunz gave us a look at character\
  \ creation in Starfinder. This chapter has it all! Whether you're an RPG veteran,\
  \ or a casual player like me, you will find ways to get your character up and running\
  \ with an intuitive building process as well as prebuilt options to pick up and\
  \ go.</li> \n      <li>Did we mention that yes, you can <i>magic missile</i> in\
  \ space?</li> \n      <li>What about a spell to summon a swarm of nano-bots to do\
  \ your space-magic bidding?! <span class=\"tiny\"><i>'Cause yeah, we did mention\
  \ that ;)</i></span></li> \n      <li>Developer Owen KC Stephens abated concerns\
  \ about the hanging question regarding goblins. in. space. Yes, they're there, and\
  \ they've got laser guns.</li> \n      <li>Did we mention weapons? <a href=\"https://twitter.com/paizo/status/868676608755851264/photo/1\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Because this is just one spread of the guns available in Starfinder.</a></li>\
  \ \n      <li>Editor Jason Keeley covered some of the information regarding starships.\
  \ The chapter covering them has rules for engagement, stats for prebuilt ships,\
  \ and rules for building your own craft.</li> \n      <li>And what point is there\
  \ in having a ship to get around without being able to travel to new worlds and\
  \ get caught in alien traps? The Game Mastering chapter provides resources for your\
  \ next campaign. Let's just hope your players are resourceful enough to escape certain\
  \ sticky situations, like, say... escape a certain trash compactor.</li> \n    \
  \  <li>To wrap up, Creative Director James L. Sutter gave us all insight into how\
  \ the system that Golarion previously occupied has evolved since the planet's mysterious\
  \ disappearance so long ago. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/paizo/status/868677952669536256/photo/1\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">The chart of the Pact Worlds system</a> includes worlds familiar\
  \ to you if you've played Pathfinder before, but with notable exceptions, such as\
  \ the replacement of Golarion with the huge center on Absalom Station and the Idari,\
  \ making its way around the Pact Worlds' sun. Each planet has a two-page spread\
  \ devoted to it in the <em>Core Rulebook</em>.</li> \n      <li>Hellknights in space!</li>\
  \ \n      <li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/paizo/status/868678659476824066/photo/1\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">... the Azlanti Star Empire.</a></li> \n      <li>A number of\
  \ familiar gods are still part of Starfinder's pantheon, but there are some new\
  \ notable additions, such as Nyarlathotep.</li>\n     </ul> \n     <div class=\"\

  \ Core Rulebook</em> will officially release, the <a href=\"/products/btpy9s2l?Starfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Alien-Archive\"\
  ><em>Alien Archive</em></a> will provide GMs and players with a number of new aliens\
  \ and monsters to expand their world. There are aliens that you can play as, enemies\
  \ to defeat, and the cute cuddly lil guys seen at the bottom of the final cover\
  \ seen below!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/product/catalog/PZO/PZO7105.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/product/catalog/PZO/PZO7105_360.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p><em>Alien Archive</em> takes a departure from the <em>Bestiary</em>\
  \ volumes released for the Pathfinder RPG, as it will include options specific to\
  \ the aliens found within such as equipment, spells, and more. Meaning that there\
  \ is something for just about everyone within its pages.</p> \n     <p>After the\
  \ Starfinder portion, Erik gave us a look at what is ahead for Golarion a few some\
  \ many years before. The just-announced War for the Crown Adventure Path begins\
  \ in February 2018! War for the Crown is a Taldor-centric campaign of espionage\
  \ and intrigue where your heroes decide the fate of the nation. This next Adventure\
  \ Path is being coordinated by mastermind Developer Crystal Frasier! Stay tuned\
  \ for more details about this Adventure Path this summer.</p> \n     <p>So, the\
  \ PaizoCon Banquet is generally where Erik goes up and mic drops a brand new Pathfinder\
  \ RPG hardcover, but! We're not quite ready for that at the moment. Instead, he\
  \ unveiled two new final covers...</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    \

  //static3.paizo.com/image/product/catalog/PZO/PZO1140_360.jpeg\"></a>\n     </div>\
  \ \n     <p>And the brand-new shifter iconic character for November's <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9sjz?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Ultimate-Wilderness\"><em>Ultimate\
  \ Wilderness</em></a>...</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"\

  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>The new shifter class is best described being to the\
  \ druid as paladins are to clerics. Oh, and they can get claws. EVERYONE GETS CLAWS!\
  \ While the shifter gains access to a number of animalistic aspects, it scales until\
  \ it receives the capstone ability to simultaneously access 5 of these at one time.\
  \ Imagine it now: a part bear, part owl, all mighty mean clawing machine!</p> \n\
  \     <p>PaizoCon would not be the show it is without our Organized Play programs.\
  \ Organized Play Coordinator Tonya Woldridge and John Compton introduced us the\
  \ upcoming Pathfinder Society Roleplaying and Adventure Card Guild seasons, which\
  \ for the first time will be intertwined and following the same storyline. You can\
  \ look forward to the launch of Faction's Favor in two and a half months at Gen\
  \ Con 50.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/PFS-NextSeason.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/PFS-NextSeason_500.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>We also have a new program launching at Gen Con to support\
  \ Starfinder. The Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild begins with the Year of the\
  \ Scoured Stars. A disaster has befallen the Starfinder Society, and it's the role\
  \ of you to rebuild the organization and determine its future. If you missed it,\
  \ Starfinder Society Developer Thurston Hillman detailed some of the finer points\
  \ for the upcoming program <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ljuj?A-Talk-About-Cooperation\"\
  >on the blog yesterday afternoon</a>.</p> \n     <p>I mentioned our amazing and\
  \ illustrious crew of Venture-Officers above, and it goes without saying that these\
  \ folks are some of the coolest people I've had the pleasure of meeting and working\
  \ with. This years' Volunteer of the Year award was presented to Venture-Lieutenant,\
  \ David Jacobson, for all of his hard work in the Pathfinder Society Adventure Card\
  \ Guild, and coordinating with the Paizo and Lone Shark teams to make the Adventure\
  \ Card Game thrive. Please join us in congratulating David and thanking him for\
  \ all of his contributions to the ACG!</p> \n     <p>The latter half of the presentation\
  \ covered a number of our licensed projects, including: Pathfinder: Kingmaker, Pathfinder\
  \ Adventures, Pathfinder Battles, Syrinscape SoundSets (which are going to be available\
  \ in retail stores this summer!!!), <a href=\"/paizo/news/v5748eaic9vp6?Pathfinder-RPG-to-be-Made-into-Pathfinder\"\
  >a newly announced digital CCG with 37 Games</a>, and so much more! I defer to our\
  \ expert Director of Licensing, and there will be an updating covered everything\
  \ we had the opportunity to show off this coming Friday!</p> \n     <p>If you are\
  \ at PaizoCon <i>right now</i> and have a spare moment, check out the Delve tables,\
  \ where we've switched to showing off Starfinder! I'm going to get on the road down\
  \ to SeaTac and meet y'all there! Have an excellent weekend, and we'll see you on\
  \ the other side!</p> \n     <p>Chris Lambertz<br> <i>Community &amp; Digital Content\
