  \     </div>\n     <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\">With <em>Pathfinder\
  \ Player Core 2</em> releasing at the start of August, we know players are anticipating\
  \ the remastered versions of some of their favorite classes! In a series of blogs\
  \ starting right here, we’ll be alternating between talking about the changes to\
  \ four of the classes and showing off some fun fiction and art starring the iconic\
  \ characters of <em>Player Core 2</em>.</p>\n      <p>The champion is the premier\
  \ divine warrior, with some of the best armor and defenses in the game. They’re\
  \ devoted to their deity and their tenets. One of the major changes to the remaster\
  \ was dropping alignment, which the champion has always featured heavily, so we\
  \ know everyone expects big changes to the class!</p>\n      <p>We’ve already put\
  \ basic compatibility rules for the champion in the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/pathfinder/faq\"\
  >Pathfinder FAQ</a>—see <em>Pathfinder Core Rulebook</em> Errata (Remaster Compatibility)—\
  but the <em>Player Core 2</em> version will present a much more thorough overhaul.\
  \ So what do fans of this class have to look forward to?</p>\n      <div class=\"\

  >Seelah, the iconic champion, battles a tyrant devil. Art by William Liu.</p>\n\
  \      </div>\n      <br>\n      <p>Before the remaster, a champion’s alignment\
  \ and their choice of champion cause established a strict set of hierarchical rules\
  \ to be followed. Each good and evil alignment had a cause tied to it, like the\
  \ lawful good paladin, chaotic good liberator, and neutral evil desecrator. The\
  \ remastered version still has a cause, but the focus has shifted away from being\
  \ so strict and static. Now we use edicts and anathema tied to different character\
  \ choices to guide your roleplaying.</p>\n      <p>Let’s take the paladin as an\
  \ example. They used to follow the two tenets of good, two tenets of the lawful\
  \ good paladin cause, and any edicts and anathema for their deity. A champion under\
  \ the remastered rules would choose the justice cause. They would follow the edicts\
  \ and anathema of their deity, plus the following from the cause of justice.</p>\n\
  \      <p><strong>Edicts</strong> follow the law, respect legitimate authorities\
  \ or leadership</p>\n      <p><strong>Anathema</strong> take advantage of another,\
  \ cheat</p>\n      <p>More emphasis on edicts rather than an unbendable code loosens\
  \ some of the restrictions on their roleplaying to allow more well-rounded, nuanced\
  \ characters. There’s a better balance over “should nots” instead of all “must nots.”\
  </p>\n      <p>A champion can optionally choose a sanctification. If you’ve read\
  \ <em>Pathfinder Player Core</em>, you’re familiar with holy and unholy sanctification—\
  a choice based on your deity that lets you commit yourself to the battle for souls\
  \ between the holy planes and unholy planes. Champions can choose sanctification\
  \ based on their deity, though unholy sanctification is an uncommon option. Each\
  \ sanctification gives you another edict and anathema, and adds the holy or unholy\
  \ trait to all your Strikes.</p>\n      <p>Some, but not all, champion causes require\
  \ a certain sanctification. Justice, mentioned above, does not. The Player Core\
  \ 2 causes are justice, liberation, and obedience (open to all); desecration and\
  \ iniquity (open only to unholy champions); and redemption and grandeur (open only\
  \ to holy champions). If you are already playing a champion and want to update them\
  \ to the new options, you’ll probably be able to keep the core of that character.\
  \ Though you can always shake things up with the new grandeur cause, which is based\
  \ on the brilliant splendor of celestials.</p>\n      <br>\n      <h3>Other Changes</h3>\n\
  \      <p>This class has seen a huge number of other changes we think will make\
  \ it more satisfying to play, but we don’t want to keep you here all day with one\
  \ blog post. So here’s the short version!</p>\n      <ul>\n       <li>You now have\
  \ a defined champion’s aura for your reactions, aura feats, and other abilities,\
  \ which lets other rules alter and refer to the range of your divine abilities more\
  \ easily.</li>\n       <li>The divine ally ability has been changed to blessing\
  \ of the devoted, and the mount has moved to a 1st-level feat. You can instead choose\
  \ the blessed swiftness option to move faster—whether you’re mounted or not.</li>\n\
  \       <li>Feats saw a ton of change, like the new Defensive Advance feat and updated\
  \ structure for Mercy. We focused on broadly useful feats plus maintaining some\
  \ backward compatibility, but we did run out of room. You’ll see oath feats moved\
  \ to <em>Lost Omens Divine Mysteries</em>. We’re hoping to find a book in which\
  \ it would make sense to remaster litanies at some point, but we don’t have one\
  \ that can hold them yet.</li>\n       <li>You choose a focus spell based on your\
  \ deity’s divine font options. As before the remaster, you can choose <em>lay on\
  \ hands</em> if your deity allows the <em>heal</em> divine font or <em>touch of\
  \ the void</em> (formerly <em>touch of corruption</em>) if they allow the <em>harm</em>\
  \ divine font. However, there’s also a new option for a deity with any font, specially\
  \ made for defense-minded characters. Introducing <em>shields of the spirit</em>!</li>\n\
  \      </ul>\n      <br>\n      <p><strong>Shields of the Spirit [one-action] Focus\
  \ 1</strong></p>\n      <p><strong>Uncommon, Champion, Concentrate, Focus, Sanctified,\
  \ Spirit</strong><br><strong>Requirements</strong> You are wielding a shield.</p>\n\
  \      <p>You Raise your Shield, causing ephemeral spirit shields to float within\
  \ your champion’s aura. The shields last until the start of your next turn or until\
  \ you’re no longer raising your shield, whichever comes first. While one of your\
  \ allies is in your champion’s aura, the shields grant them a +1 status bonus to\
  \ AC, and each time an enemy makes an attack against the ally, the enemy takes 1d4\
  \ spirit damage (even if it misses).</p>\n      <p>The benefit applies only while\
  \ an ally is in your aura, ending for any ally that leaves and applying to any that\
  \ enters later. As normal, you don’t count as your own ally and therefore don’t\
  \ get the benefits of the spirit shields yourself.<br><strong>Heightened (+2)</strong>\
  \ The damage increases by 1d4.</p>\n      <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight:\
