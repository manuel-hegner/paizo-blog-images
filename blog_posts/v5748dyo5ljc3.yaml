  ><em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: The First World, Realm of the Fey</em></a> rapidly\
  \ approaching, some kind folks on the forums have been asking for a taste of what\
  \ you'll find inside. And what better place to start than with the godlike Eldest\
  \ of mysteries and secrets?</p> \n    <p>It's no secret that this book is special\
  \ for me. Not only have I been working on it sporadically for so long that the original\
  \ paper pagination I wrote out has started to look like an antique treasure map,\
  \ but the First World has always captured my love of the <i>weirdness</i> of Pathfinder.\
  \ A place where anything can happen, there's infinite variety around every corner,\
  \ and beings great and powerful can toss you into an adventure in an instant! It's\
  \ the same draw that led me to first start work on Kaer Maga (following in the gonzo\
  \ footsteps of folks like China Miéville and Richard Pett), or to follow trailblazers\
  \ like Wes and Jacobs into the Outer Planes with my novels. For me, the more bizarre\
  \ oddities you can pack into a setting book, the better.</p> \n    <p>And one of\
  \ the things that excited me most about this project was the prospect of getting\
  \ to give all of the Eldest a full <em>Book of the Damned</em>/<a href=\"/products/btpy8xe9\"\
  ><em>Chronicle of the Righteous</em></a>-style write-up. Ever since Wes did <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8a6f\">the first <em>Book of the Damned</em></a>, it's been one of\
  \ my favorite campaign setting books, and I shamelessly ripped off that format for\
  \ <em>The First World</em>. Each of the Eldest in the book gets their own spread—\
  the left page a write-up about the god (like this one for Ng), and the right detailing\
  \ that Eldest's seat of power—in Ng's case, the fabled Palace of Seasons. As with\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9j74\"><em>Inner Sea Faiths</em></a>, all of the Eldest\
  \ come with boons and obediences that work with both the prestige classes in that\
  \ book and the new feysworn prestige class presented in this one.</p> \n    <p>But\
  \ of course, the <i>true</i> best part of this book for me is finally getting to\
  \ see the Eldest illustrated! Ever since their first introduction in <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8fnz\"><em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #36</em></a>, I've wanted to\
  \ see them brought to life, and this version of Ng is everything I had imagined\
  \ and more, perfectly capturing the aura of mystery and menace that should accompany\
  \ any of the fickle fey lords!</p> \n    <p>Thanks for reading, and stay tuned for\
  \ future blogs, where I hope to do at least one more preview before <a href=\"/products/btpy9op9\"\
  ><em>The First World</em></a> launches!</p> \n    <p style=\"clear: both;\">James\
