  artist: "Jason Engle... Vadid and Nahk Preview Purloiners Though the Pactmasters\
    \ are rarely seen outside their palace walls, they are keenly alert of all that\
    \ transpires within Katapesh through their network of spies and active patrols\
    \ of the Zephyr Guard. The Zephyr Guard is made up of diverse ethnic groups and\
    \ races, but mostly humanoids such as humans, half-elves, and half-orcs. Their\
    \ unifying feature is their expertise in combat and the precision with which they\
    \ carry out their duties. A Zephyr Guard squad is usually composed of five elite\
    \ soldiers (LN fighter 4) and their squad leader (LN fighter 6). Each squad leader\
    \ carries a charm of aluum control, which is magically bound to them, making it\
    \ useless to anyone else. Aluum are powerful golems created to maintain order\
    \ in Katapesh when other forms of authority fail (see the Appendix for statistics).\
    \ Dormant aluum are scattered through the city in key locations for the Zephyr\
    \ Guard. They stand silent vigil at street corners, in the shadows of buildings,\
    \ around busy squares, and throughout the numerous bazaars. No matter where one\
    \ goes in Katapesh, an aluum is never far away. Look for the full article on the\
    \ Zephyr Guard in the upcoming product, Pathfinder Chronicles: Dark Markets—A\
    \ Guide to Katapesh!"
