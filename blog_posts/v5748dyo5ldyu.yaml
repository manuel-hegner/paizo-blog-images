  \ Scott de Bie</p> \n   <h2>Chapter Two: The Gang</h2> \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"\
  > \n    <p>\"You're sure about this gang?\" Fat Gorm fidgeted, rubbing his fingers\
  \ together. \"I only ask, because the hour presses on—\"</p> \n    <p>\"Sit easy.\"\
  \ Tarrant hummed dancing wisps of music, which calmed him. He wondered how anyone\
  \ who couldn't see music managed to relax. </p> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\"\
  >They met at midnight in the Bloody Fang, a dive down in the Puddles district that\
  \ catered to sailors, criminals, and the lowest of the low. The authorities of Absalom\
  \ rarely made it there, and certainly not at this hour of night. Entering after\
  \ sunset required a chit: a coin-sized disc of wood branded with a crude image of\
  \ a dragon's fang. Tarrant turned his over in his fingers as he mentally rehearsed\
  \ the plan.</span></p> \n    <p>It had taken three days to set up the meet—good\
  \ timing, as the last of the expedition treasure would be arriving the next day.\
  \ It would be stored in the Blackscale Blades' base of operations until appraisers\
  \ could arrive and a full accounting could be made. The dishonorable adventurers\
  \ were living it up in the city, spending coin freely and bragging of the dragon\
  \ they had supposedly slain. Crossing them didn't seem wise, but Tarrant had spent\
  \ the last three days coming up with a perfect plan. </p> \n    <p>In truth, the\
  \ entire scheme had occurred to him seconds after Gorm told him about the hoard,\
  \ but he'd given it some time to crescendo in his mind, the different parts of music\
  \ falling into place. He couldn't play a symphony alone, however, and he hoped the\
  \ crew gathering in the Bloody Fang would be exactly what he needed.</p> \n    <p>A\
  \ man came tumbling in the swinging doors, rolled several paces, then lay groaning.\
  \ The big Ulfen warrior who stepped in the door after him had pale skin and hair\
  \ and many woad tattoos carved across his honed frame. If the show of force and\
  \ muscle weren't enough, the hooked axe strapped to his back proved sufficient to\
  \ discourage any would-be challengers. </p> \n    <p>\"That would be Arlif, I reckon.\"\
  \ Fat Gorm stumbled over the name. \"They say his tattoos depict the men he's killed.\
  \ Well—the memorable ones, at least.\"</p> \n    <p>\"He must have killed a goodly\
  \ number,\" Tarrant observed. \"Where did you find him?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Mercenary.\
  \ Been cracking heads around the island for about a year now. No one's ever heard\
  \ him speak, but by <i>Torag</i> is he strong. And you did say you needed a tough.\"\
  \ </p> \n    <p>\"That is what I said.\"</p> \n    <p>Arlif dropped his chit on\
  \ the table, waved for mead, and sat in brooding silence.</p> \n    <p>The sneak\
  \ came next, though he didn't make nearly the entrance Arlif had. The halfling's\
  \ silhouette in the creaking doorway looked like that of a child, but the worldly\
  \ gleam in his eye belied that impression. Also, no boy-child, no matter how ludicrous\
  \ his taste in fashion, would wear such a hat, with its sweeping red and gold feather.\
  \ </p> \n    <p>\"Eram Many-Fingers.\" Tarrant sighed. \"I should have known you'd\
  \ bring him in.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I thought you liked the halfling. You've pulled\
  \ many jobs together, right?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Oh indeed. More than even he can count.\"\
  \ Tarrant nodded to where the halfling was indicating the number of drinks he wanted\
  \ on his six-fingered left hand. \"That doesn't mean you should trust him.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Of course not,\" Gorm said, offended. \"But we can trust him to be\
  \ untrustworthy.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Ah, my friends!\" the halfling said. \"I almost\
  \ thought I'd come to the wrong place, but oh joyous day, here I find you! I'm off\
  \ for a drink, you want something? No? Well then!\"</p> \n    <p>The enthusiastic\
  \ halfling headed off to find the nearest server.</p> \n    <p>The magic arrived\
  \ next, in the form of a feminine shape in the Fang's door. The other patrons quieted\
  \ and looked, but when Gislai drew back her hood to reveal her lank black hair,\
  \ greenish skin, and small tusks, most glanced away. She smiled and stretched languidly,\
  \ revealing the three daggers of Calistria on an amulet around her neck. </p> \n\
  \    <p>\"Gorgeous Gislai?\" Gorm said. \"Why, Akayn? Why do you do this to yourself?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Have faith. Half-orc or no, Gislai is the best cleric for any heist\
  \ I've ever worked.\"</p> \n    <p>\"You mean you worked <i>her</i>.\"</p> \n  \
  \  <p>\"I'll not deny I like green.\" That made him think of the other night, and\
  \ the way Ephere's leaf-scale armor clung to her body. \"Besides, it's in the past.\
  \ We're strictly professional now.\"</p> \n    <p>\"This is going to go badly.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Do you want to do this, or shall I sell you into indentured servitude\
  \ right now?\" Tarrant asked. \"Maybe Doreset will discount you—he might just take\
  \ your hands as payment.\"</p> \n    <p>Fat Gorm paled. </p> \n    <div class=\"\

  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Ephere_360.jpeg\" border=\"0\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> Ephere seems to be the center of attention wherever she goes.\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>\"There he is.\" Gislai strode to their table. \"Liespinner,\
  \ the city of Absalom did herself a disservice letting you out. Better to keep you\
  \ sealed up there with the other thieves and traitors.\" </p> \n    <p>\"Greetings\
  \ to you too. Apologies for not writing—I was a bit chained up at the time.\" </p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Good.\" The half-orc eased into a chair and put her boots up on the\
  \ table. She toyed with one of her shuriken and nodded to Gorm. \"Who's this? The\
  \ coin?\"</p> \n    <p>\"The empty purse, actually.\" Gorm gave Tarrant an uneasy\
  \ look. \"Your take, your gang—have it your own way. But have a care too, yes?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Mm?\" Tarrant asked. \"Sorry, I was too stricken with Gislai's disarming\
  \ looks. Anger serves her complexion admirably.\"</p> \n    <p>The half-orc glared\
  \ at him. \"And the spinning begins already.\"</p> \n    <p>Arlif watched the exchange\
  \ in silence.</p> \n    <p>As Gorm slipped away, his stealthy tread seeming more\
  \ of a waddle, Eram arrived with a tray of libations. Tarrant knew better than to\
  \ take any—the halfling's thirst was legendary.</p> \n    <p>\"Greetings.\" Tarrant\
  \ spread his hands wide. \"No doubt you've heard something of this already, but\
  \ let me fill in the rest of the story. First, the reward is fantastic. Lord Doreset\
  \ chartered a group of adventurers on a delve to uncover ancient treasures in what\
  \ was supposed to be a deserted ruin. It turned out to be a dragon's lair, complete\
  \ with a dragon—which the heroes slew—and a fabulous hoard. Once His Corpulentness\
  \ learned of the hoard, he decided the original terms of the contract were far to\
  \ unfavorable to himself, and immediately dispatched his good friends, the Blackscale\
  \ Blades mercenary company, to make things right by claiming the entire hoard for\
  \ Doreset. They're even now bringing the treasure back to Absalom to be stored until\
  \ it can be appraised.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Stored, you say,\" Gislai said. \"Stored\
  \ where?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Blackscale Hall, right?\" Eram said. \"Please say Blackscale\
  \ Hall.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Not quite,\" Tarrant said. \"Doreset's stronghold: Hawkthorne's\
  \ Shield.\"</p> \n    <p>Eram coughed out some of his rotgut, then drank it again.\
  \ \"What?\"</p> \n    <p>\"I thought you were insane.\" Gislai shook her head. \"\
  Now I <i>know</i> you are.\"</p> \n    <p>Arlif nodded slowly.</p> \n    <p>\"No\
  \ no no,\" Eram said. \"When I agreed to this job, I thought we'd take it en route,\
  \ not from gods-damned Hawkthorne's Shield!\"</p> \n    <p>\"I know robbing the\
  \ tower may seem difficult,\" Tarrant said. \"Walls of stone a spear's length thick,\
  \ iron doors reinforced with steel bands, and every window, sewer grate, and rat\
  \ hole sealed up tight with the best magic the Doreset family can muster. Not exactly\
  \ a comfy place to live, which is why His Lordship houses his apartments elsewhere.\
  \ But as a secure storage facility, it can't be beat.\"</p> \n    <p>\"That's even\
  \ worse than I thought,\" Gislai said. \"What's your plan? We talk our way in? You,\
  \ a notorious criminal, and we, your known associates.\" </p> \n    <p>\"Yes,\"\
  \ Tarrant said. \"And while notoriety appeals to me, 'twould be kinder to my pride\
  \ if you used the words ‘suspected' and ‘alleged' in your description.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"I stand by my words.\" She tossed a shuriken a hand's width into the air\
  \ and let it sink into the table. \"Maybe you want to try a ‘raving lunatic' game?\
  \ It would fit.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Because you're mad,\" Eram said. \"<i>Mad!</i>\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Leaving that aside for the moment,\" Tarrant said. \"Even if we\
  \ get in, and even if we manage to steal the treasure, getting out won't be easy.\
  \ That place is as much a prison as a fortress.\" </p> \n    <p>\"I have a ring\
  \ that will teleport us,\" Gislai said. \"Limited use, but it can potentially get\
  \ us out. Or in, technically, if we know where we were going.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Alas,\" Tarrant said. \"Lord Doreset has the vault warded against such things, necessitating\
  \ that the Blackscales bring the items in by hand. Not to worry, though.\" From\
  \ within his tunic, he took a red silk bag little bigger than a coin purse, into\
  \ which he inserted his entire arm, then withdrew it. \"I lived in the tower for\
  \ nearly a year, once upon a time—I know exactly how to get in and out again. Follow\
  \ my plan, and there's no way we can fail.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Plan? What plan?\" asked\
  \ Eram.</p> \n    <p>\"Remember the ‘helpful peddler' job we pulled in Cassomir?\
  \ And how you owe me?\"</p> \n    <p>Eram shuddered. \"You said you'd never bring\
  \ that up again.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I'm the Liespinner, Many-Fingers,\" Tarrant said.\
  \ \"We do this one the same way—haversack and all.\"</p> \n    <p>\"We'll need luck,\"\
  \ Eram said. \"Sure you don't want to go seduce a priestess of Desna into this game?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Calistria can kiss as well as sting,\" Gislai said, scowling at\
  \ the halfling. \"We make our own luck. And no one's seducing anyone.\"</p> \n \
  \   <p>\"Pity, that,\" Eram said.</p> \n    <p>Arlif had been watching, but something\
  \ drew his attention past Tarrant.</p> \n    <p>\"All seeming madness aside,\" Tarrant\
  \ said. \"My plan requires a blade, a thief, a caster, and a face—that's the four\
  \ of us. Now we just have to find a lure. A means of distraction.\" </p> \n    <p>\"\
  You're still mad,\" Eram said. \"We...\" He trailed off and followed Arlif's gaze.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"A lure,\" Gislai said. \"You think that's all we need?\"</p> \n   \
  \ <p>\"With the plan I have? Yes. And—\" He saw what Eram and Arlif were looking\
  \ at. \"Ah.\"</p> \n    <p>Sure enough, Ephere had entered the Bloody Fang and sat\
  \ at a table ten paces removed. Her presence drew Tarrant's senses like a lodestone.\
  \ He could smell her from here, like a sweet earthen incense, and see the faint\
  \ green light of a tune she was singing under her breath.</p> \n    <p>Gislai followed\
  \ his gaze, her frown deepening. \"Who is she?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Inspiration.\" Tarrant\
  \ got to his feet. \"Pardon a moment, fellow conspirators and lady.\" </p> \n  \
  \  <p>\"Where are you going?\" Eram turned to Gislai. \"Where is he going?\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"I was wrong about the seducing bit.\" The half-orc shook her head.\
  \ \"He's always an idiot for a woman.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Speaking from experience,\
  \ are we?\" Eram asked.</p> \n    <p>Gislai nodded gravely.</p> \n    <p>Tarrant\
  \ made his way to Ephere's table. Without speaking or even looking up at him, she\
  \ laid the Bloody Fang chit he had given her back at the Open Palm on the table.\
  \ </p> \n    <p>Tarrant's heart sped up with everyone watching them. Every day of\
  \ his life, he trod upon a stage for his enemies, and he loved every deadly hour\
  \ of it.</p> \n    <p>Mindful of appearances, Tarrant swept a wide, attention-gathering\
  \ bow. \"Twice I have the honor and pleasure of your beauty, Lady Ephere.\" </p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Liespinner,\" she said without looking at him. \"I am in your debt\
  \ for the service you did me last time we met.\" </p> \n    <p>\"Did you remember\
  \ my offer and come to test my tongue? With your true name, that is.\" </p> \n \
  \   <p>\"Saleae Epheldera,\" Ephere said, the elven words falling from her lips\
  \ like rain. She listened for his pronunciation and nodded in approval. \"You speak\
  \ my tongue well for a human.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I travel,\" he said. \"Now that we've\
  \ been properly introduced, I've come to offer you a proposition. Ah!\" He smiled\
  \ broadly as she bristled at the word. \"Apologies for my ill speech. I assure you,\
  \ I intend nothing scandalous, but...\" he took her hand and bent to kiss the ruby\
  \ on her gauntlet, pausing to look into her eyes. \"I will admit that my intentions\
  \ are <i>entirely</i> dishonorable.\"</p> \n    <p>Ephere made no sign of backing\
  \ down. He wondered again what she saw. His arrogance, certainly, but his earnestness?\
  \ His desire for justice against Lord Doreset, a noble leech who'd grown fat at\
  \ the expense of the weak and powerless?</p> \n    <p>At that moment, the doors\
  \ flung open, and a tiny ball of flame sailed into the chamber. \"Akayn!\" came\
  \ a shout.</p> \n    <p>Tarrant threw his arms around Ephere and sang of racing\
  \ stallions on the far-away tundra. Feathers of golden light flowed from his lips\
  \ and encircled his feet to hasten him as he carried Ephere past the table and out\
  \ an open window.</p> \n    <p>The Bloody Fang exploded in flame behind them as\
  \ they rolled out into the rainy darkness. Tarrant found himself lying side-by-side\
  \ with Ephere, their faces close. He managed to look away long enough to see two\
  \ familiar Hellknights near the front of the tavern, standing among a crowd of folk\
  \ shouting for the watch or for water. Between the knights stood a tall blonde woman\
  \ in severe black armor, who held aloft in her barbed gauntlets the source of the\
  \ blast: a wand that smoked slightly.</p> \n    <p>Altara the Hound: Hellknight,\
  \ hunter, and his favorite regret.</p> \n    <p>\"Akayn!\" she cried. \"Show yourself!\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Excitement shivered through him. He thought that if he'd been on his\
  \ own he might have liked to face Altara then and there—but he had Ephere to worry\
  \ about. She might kill one or both of Altara's minions and <i>then</i> there would\
  \ be trouble.</p> \n    <p>The elf shifted, and he put a hand on her breastbone\
  \ to signal her to wait. He felt the heat radiating from beneath her armor. She\
  \ stared at him dangerously.</p> \n    <p>Tarrant sang a quick spell his mother\
  \ had written about him. Magic sculpted the smoke into an illusory likeness of Tarrant\
  \ himself—tall, dark-skinned, with piercing eyes and a wry smile—which nodded to\
  \ its creator and ran off down the street. Altara barked an order, and the Hellknights\
  \ gave chase.</p> \n    <p>Ephere's eyes gleamed. \"Yet again, you've caused me\
  \ trouble, then saved me from it. What is it you want, Tarrant Akayn?\"</p> \n \
  \   <p>\"Well.\" Tarrant saw movement near the tavern. His allies had escaped—Gislai\
  \ in particular was glaring at him. </p> \n    <p>He smiled. \"How would you like\
  \ a job?\"</p> \n    <p align=\"center\">∗∗∗</p> \n    <p>\"Intriguing offer,\"\
  \ Altara said as the sun rose outside Lord Doreset's manor. \"But no.\"</p> \n \
  \   <p>\"No?\" The would-be betrayer looked shocked. </p> \n    <p>Lord Doreset,\
  \ who was snoozing by the fire, smiled. \"That is what she said.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  But—\" Eram Many-Fingers sputtered. \"But I'm handing Tarrant Akayn to you on a\
  \ platter! Trussed up like a goose and delivered to your great, lovely, and honestly\
  \ somewhat intimidating majesty!\"</p> \n    <p>Altara yawned. \"Do you know how\
  \ I spent the last year? This year that the master you would so eagerly betray spent\
  \ in prison here in Absalom?\"</p> \n    <p>The halfling shook his head. </p> \n\
  \    <p>\"Reading,\" she said. \"Interviewing. Thinking. I've hardly slept nor ate.\
  \ When my knights woke me to tell of a traitor at my doorstep, I'd only been abed\
  \ an hour or so.\" </p> \n    <p>She rose, and the halfling flinched.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>\"I know this man,\" she said. \"I know everything about his games here in\
  \ Absalom, and I know all about your dubious allegiances. If you would betray your\
  \ friend, what would stop you from betraying me? No.\" </p> \n    <p>She nodded\
  \ toward Eram, signaling her knights to flank him.</p> \n    <p>\"No deal, thief,\"\
  \ she said. \"The law will be satisfied in the law's way, not through the treachery\
  \ of a sneak seeking to protect himself. In the end, I'll catch you all. And I will\
  \ destroy you.\"</p> \n    <p>The halfling tensed just before the first Hellknight\
  \ laid hands on him, then twisted free. His would-be captor overbalanced and tripped\
  \ over the halfling, who seized the opportunity to jab the other knight with his\
  \ dagger.</p> \n    <p>Lord Doreset spoke up. \"Might as well let him go. Let the\
  \ Liespinner think all remains well. Many-Fingers will tell him nothing.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"And if he does?\" Altara asked. </p> \n    <p>\"What, that he tried to\
  \ betray him? No.\" Doreset laughed. \"Unless of course this was part of Akayn's\
  \ scheme, and he sent Many-Fingers himself. If so, he knows nothing significant.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"True.\" Altara—who had been drawing her sword—sighed and sat back\
  \ in her seat. \"Again, I counsel you to unbind my hands, and let me take Akayn\
  \ by force. There is naught to be gained by playing this game. He will defeat you.\"\
  \ </p> \n    <p>\"And again, I remind you of our agreement.\" Doreset sipped his\
  \ morning tea. \"You almost spoiled my plan with your little fireball assault earlier—\
  no more rash action. Akayn is a creature of great arrogance—he will come at us anyway.\
  \ And when he does, we will be waiting.\"</p> \n    <p>Altara snorted. \"Many have\
  \ sought to outwit Akayn, and all have failed. How do you know he'll not make such\
  \ a fool of you again?\"</p> \n    <p>A smile spread across Lord Doreset's perpetually\
  \ greasy lips. \"Because I have my own secret knife to wield at the right moment.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>He waved. On cue, a tapestry moved aside, and someone stepped into\
  \ the chamber. Altara was confused until she saw the brand burning on the newcomer's\
  \ chest.</p> \n    <p>She knew Tarrant Akayn—knew his strengths, and especially\
  \ his weaknesses.</p> \n    <p>And this would be the end of him.</p> \n    <p><b>Coming\
