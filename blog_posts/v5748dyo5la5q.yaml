  \ \n    <p>First things firstâ€”if you haven't already checked it out, <a href=\"\
  \ /download/gamemastery/D0-HollowsLastHope.zip\">D0: Hollow's Last Hope</a> is now\
  \ available as a free PDF download right <a href=\" /download/gamemastery/D0-HollowsLastHope.zip\"\
  >here</a>. What are you waiting for? It's <i>free!</i> </p>\n    <p>Ahem. We now\
  \ return you to the topic at hand: module letter designations. </p>\n    <p>So <a\
  \ href=\"/store/v5748btpy7xpy\">D0: Hollow's Last Hope</a> is a prequel of sorts\
  \ to <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7yqz\"><i>D1: Crown of the Kobold King</i></a>. It\
  \ follows, then, that <a href=\"/store/magazines/v5748btpy7wiz\">D2</a> is a sequel\
  \ to D1. Right?</p> \n    <p>Well, no, actually. D2 is completely unrelated to D0\
  \ and D1. On the other hand, <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7x86\">E1</a> is set in Falcon's\
  \ Hollow, the settlement that serves as the starting point of D0 and D1. Confused\
  \ yet? Let us help sort out things a bit.</p> \n   </blockquote> <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7x6k\"\

  right\" hspace=\"12\"></a> \n   <blockquote> \n    <p>These alphanumeric designators\
  \ hearken back to the old way of numbering modules from the earliest days of RPGs.\
  \ With a few exceptions (the A, D, G, and Q series, for example) the older module\
  \ lines used their alphanumeric designators to denote adventures of a similar nature\
  \ that aren't related. Don't think of any series designator we've announced so far\
  \ as being a set of sequels you can run one after another. Consider each adventure\
  \ separately unless it specifically calls itself a sequel to an earlier adventure.\
  \ The designator is just there to tell you what kind of adventure to expect, with\
  \ the number telling you the order in which we published it.</p> \n    <p>What,\
  \ then, do the designators mean?</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><b>D is for Dungeon.</b>\
  \ These adventures take place primarily in a dungeon, whether that means an underground\
  \ complex or some other kind of self-contained area for PCs to explore.</p> \n \
  \    <p><b>E is for Event.</b> These adventures focus on some kind of event you\
  \ can place anywhere you want, such a jousting tournament, a royal wedding, or (as\
  \ in the example of <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7x86\">E1</a>) a carnival. Although\
  \ all E adventures will be set somewhere in our campaign setting, they are the easiest\
  \ to place anywhere you want or need them. </p> \n     <p><b>J is for Journey.</b>\
  \ These adventures either focus on a journey to some exotic locale or else deal\
  \ with what you find once you get to such an interesting place. (<a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7x6l\"\
  >J1</a> takes place in Osirion, the Egypt analog of Golarion.)</p> \n     <p><b>U\
  \ is for Urban.</b> These adventures take place in cities and focus on the kinds\
  \ of adventures you can only have when surrounded by thousands of other people.\
  \ (<a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7x6k\">U1</a> occurs in a wealthy district of Absalom,\
  \ one of the largest cities on Golarion.)</p> \n    </blockquote>\n   </blockquote>\
  \ <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7wiz\"><img src=\"/image/product/catalog/PZO/PZO9503_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"12\"></a> \n   <blockquote>\n    <blockquote>\
  \ \n     <p><b>W is for Wilderness.</b> These adventures occur in the wild places\
  \ of the world. You might have a hint of civilization in a W adventure, but the\
  \ main focus is on the untamed areas. (PCs in <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7zd8\">W1</a>\
  \ attempt to civilize Bloodsworn Vale.)</p> \n     <p><b>C is for Cookie.</b> That's\
  \ good enough for me.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>At some point in the future\
  \ we will undoubtedly release modules that belong together in a series, at which\
  \ point we'll likely give them their own designators. There have been whispers of\
  \ an M series, for example, wherein Erik Mona creates several linked adventures\
  \ set on our southern continent. And, of course, sequels to previous adventures\
  \ in a series might occasionally crop up. We'll make sure to make that very clear\
  \ when it happens.</p> \n    <p>Mike McArtor <br>Associate Editor, GameMastery</p>\
