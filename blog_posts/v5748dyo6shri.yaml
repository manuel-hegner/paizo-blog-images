  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">“Alright Tuku. Today you’\
  re going to teach me about water spirits!” Ija turned toward her companion and gave\
  \ a fierce grin.</p> \n     <p>“Water <em>elementals</em>, you mean?” Tuku replied.\
  \ The pink dragon’s wings fluttered as he glided from one tree limb perch to another.\
  \ “I see the stretch of shore we’re looking for. It’s just ahead. When we pass the\
  \ tree line, they’ll see us.”</p> \n     <p>“Elementals, spirits; what’s the difference?\
  \ They’re relatives of yours, right?” Ija asked. She knew they weren’t, but it was\
  \ fun to tease Tuku a little.</p> \n     <p>“They most certainly are not. I am a\
  \ dragon!” he bristled slightly, though not truly annoyed.</p> \n     <p>Ija’s eyes\
  \ lit up. “I heard elementals can take any shape. They could be dogs, or bats, or\
  \ <em>dragons</em>…” </p> \n     <p>“So you <em>did</em> read the books from the\
  \ Magaambya before we headed out here?” Tuku asked, surprised at her studiousness.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“Well, I... definitely looked at the pictures,” she admitted, though,\
  \ yes, she had read many of the words, too—eventually.</p> \n     <p>“Water elementals\
  \ are embodiments of the essence of matter, from the Plane of Water. They’re basically\
  \ pure water. I am pure dragon.” Ija threw her eidolon a sidelong glance, and he\
  \ sighed, repeating the fact she never let him forget: “Though, yes, without you\
  \ to give me a body, I’m just formless mental essence from the Astral Plane. Thank\
  \ you for giving me this <em>glorious manifestation</em>.”</p> \n     <p>Ija snorted\
  \ and rolled her eyes. “If they have no mind, does that mean we can outthink them?\
  \ Like I always outthink <em>you</em>?” This was how they worked out their strategies,\
  \ and ultimately how Tuku guided her to better use her power—teasing insults and\
  \ playful banter.</p> \n     <p>Tuku continued. “Oh, these aren’t just mindless\
  \ puddles. These things are powerful in the water and they know it. They’ll try\
  \ to drag us underwater.” He wasn’t kidding now, and Ija took the warning with the\
  \ seriousness it deserved.</p> \n     <p>“But they’re causing trouble for the fishers,\
  \ so they’re coming out of the water for that,” Ija mused, “So let’s bait them into\
  \ attacking us on land, too. I can’t swim after them if they retreat back to the\
  \ water, but you can, and—I know! D’you want <em>gills</em>?” The eidolon matched\
  \ her hopeful grin with as straight and nonplussed an expression as his draconic\
  \ face could muster. “Don’t worry! If they catch you in a trap, I’ll call you back,\
  \ or let the bond snap if I have to. But c’mon, let’s see how well you can breathe\
  \ underwater!”</p> \n     <p>Ija held the rune medallion she wore around her neck\
  \ in one hand and held the other out in Tuku’s direction. The medallion, the matching\
  \ rune on Ija’s headband, and the one emblazoned on her eidolon’s forehead all pulsed\
  \ as their magical connection surged. Tuku felt an itch on both sides of his neck,\
  \ just below his ears, and knew that he’d grown gills—at least temporarily. It wasn’\
  t the plan he’d have suggested, but what was the harm?</p> \n     <p>“Is that it?\
  \ Gills? Anything else we should be prepared for, or am I just going to <em>swim</em>\
  \ the water to death?”</p> \n     <p>“Oh, I’m not done yet!” Ija’s excitement was\
  \ palpable. She often had trouble focusing, but when she found something that captured\
  \ her attention, her enthusiasm was contagious. “So! Water conducts electricity,\
  \ right? I mean, yeah, it’s not actually the <em>water</em>, but the salts and stuff\
  \ <em>in</em> the water. So as long as these aren’t made of pure water and are made\
  \ of <em>ocean</em> water, then I should have just the thing.”</p> \n     <p>Before\
  \ Tuku could respond, Ija dashed toward the edge of the trees, leaving her dragon\
  \ companion nodding approvingly to himself.</p> \n     <p>“Hold on, short-stuff!\
  \ Not so eager, or you might tip them off that something’s happening. Let’s either\
  \ sneak up, or if we’re going to use your plan and bait them out, then pretend you\
  \ don’t know they’re there,” Tuku suggested.</p> \n     <p>“So... I’m not sure we\
  \ can convince them we’re just normal fishers they can terrorize. Do you think they’\
  re going to be, I don’t know, <em>put off</em> by the whole you-being-a-dragon thing?”\
  </p> \n     <p>“I’ll have you know that dragons are excellent at fishing. But you\
  \ do have a point. Call me to your side when the time comes?” Tuku wondered aloud.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“Too slow. You sneak, I bait,” Ija decided, “There’s not a lot of cover,\
  \ so try to use the seaweed. And your new gills!”</p> \n     <p>Tuku nodded his\
  \ assent and disappeared into the water, though Ija knew exactly where he had gone.\
  \ She wandered along the shore toward a rocky outcropping where the fishers had\
  \ reported the most recent elemental attacks, seemingly lost in thought. It wasn’\
  t hard to appear distracted, after all, because she <em>did</em> have an awful lot\
  \ of things on her mind right then, but mostly she was thinking about shocking some\
  \ water elementals. </p> \n     <p>She avoided glancing toward the water so as not\
  \ to give herself away, but instead connected her senses to Tuku’s, so every so\
  \ often she could peer through his eyes. That’s how she noticed the elementals slowly\
  \ rising from the water to ambush her. Five huge, indistinct humanoid forms, almost\
  \ the same color as the water itself. Two coming in close, one circling around,\
  \ and another backing them up. The last one lurked in the distance to her left.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>She turned her body away from them to further the deception, all the\
  \ while glaring at them from Tuku’s position nearly completely submerged among the\
  \ thick kelp nearby. </p> \n     <p>She waited... waited... That one on the left\
  \ was still too far. Waiting... OK—now! </p> \n     <p>Ija’s senses rushed back\
  \ into her own body, and she spun on her heel, already starting to cast her spell.\
  \ Only from this perspective could she see that she’d misjudged their distance from\
  \ Tuku’s vantage point; she had let them get too close! Ija might have fooled them,\
  \ but it the nearest elemental was still close enough to slam its watery fist in\
  \ her direction as she dropped her guard. Her concentration faltered—</p> \n   \
  \  <p>“Look out!” While she’d been focusing on her own part in the ambush, Tuku\
  \ was singularly occupied with keeping her safe. Realizing the threat, the dragon\
  \ rose from the water and bolted toward her. Arriving just in time, Tuku spread\
  \ his wings to shield his summoner, taking the brunt of the force as the warm, brackish\
  \ water of the elemental’s slam fell clear of Ija.</p> \n     <p>Grinning mischievously\
  \ and winking at her protector, Ija spread her hands, and unleashed a chain of lightning\
  \ toward her attackers. Forks of electricity arced from figure to figure, jolting\
  \ the elementals and causing their forms to lose cohesion. Wherever the lightning\
  \ touched, water leaked from their bodies like the contents of a bucket seeping\
  \ from uncaulked seams. Either the water <em>had</em> picked up sediments, or everything\
  \ she and Tuku had been thinking had been wrong; maybe both. It didn’t matter either\
  \ way.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/59fe594d-f2f5-4c07-81fd-50a2410261f2/070321_SummonerActionshot.jpg\"\

  \ Secrets of Magic</em></a></p>\n     </div> \n     <br> \n     <p>One of the elementals\
  \ created a vortex of water just onto the shore. The moving eddy surged forward\
  \ and back like a rushing tide, threatening to batter Ija and Tuku onto the rocks\
  \ and deliver them into the depths. Ija tried to dodge, but her foot slipped on\
  \ the wet sand. The incoming vortex was unavoidable.</p> \n     <p>But again, Tuku\
  \ was vigilant; the dragon eidolon had been in a perfect position to notice and\
  \ dodge the vortex. This time it was he who called upon their protective bond, swooping\
  \ in to grab Ija, fluttering slightly off the ground for an instant, and setting\
  \ her back down when the danger had passed.</p> \n     <p>This unlikely maneuver\
  \ gave Ija room to dodge more oncoming blows from the nearest elementals. She backed\
  \ up to a safer distance as Tuku went into a draconic frenzy, tearing apart the\
  \ elemental that took the brunt of her lightning spell. The elementals responded\
  \ in kind, surrounding the dragon and pummeling him with waves. Due to their bond,\
  \ Ija felt every impact like a hit to her own body, but she knew they could last\
  \ a little while longer. </p> \n     <p>“Ija, again!” Tuku shouted over the sound\
  \ of crashing waves.</p> \n     <p>Ija called the lightning once more, and the sharp\
  \ scent of ozone manifested as the magic sprang from her hands and arced into the\
  \ elementals’ bodies. One of the remaining elementals was slain outright, or perhaps\
  \ banished back to the Plane of Water—she honestly wasn’t sure what happened to\
  \ these things when you destroyed them. Tuku noticed another that was leaking its\
  \ essence from several places, and he used his jaws and claws to tear the holes\
  \ wider, ripping the towering figure apart until it too collapsed into a splash\
  \ of mundane water. Ija didn’t see any shining or shimmering like when a summoning\
  \ spell ended; probably dead then. </p>\n     <p>The remaining two elementals began\
  \ to flee in terror, finally realizing how dangerous Ija and Tuku were as a team.\
  \ The dragon snapped at the nearest of them and looked back toward Ija, awaiting\
  \ her approval. She quickly raised one eyebrow, as if to say, “go on,” and as quickly\
  \ as that, Tuku was off beneath the waves. </p> \n     <p>A few minutes later, the\
  \ dragon emerged from the water with a wide, goofy smile filling his toothy muzzle.\
  \ “I told you dragons were good fishers,” Tuku said. Ija squeezed her hair to rid\
  \ it of at least some of the water that now weighed heavily on her head. Her eyes\
  \ widened, expectantly. </p> \n     <p>“And yeah,” Tuku continued begrudgingly,\
  \ “I guess the gills didn’t hurt.”</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p style=\"font-weight:\
