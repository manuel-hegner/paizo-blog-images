  \ \n     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Obozaya peeked over the\
  \ rocky ridge. There was still just one of the creatures guarding the entrance,\
  \ less than fifty feet away. The tunnel mouth behind it was nothing special—just\
  \ a dark hole in the side of the hill. Yet this was where the footage had shown\
  \ the creatures taking her crew. </p> \n      <p>Obo ducked back down and considered\
  \ her rifle. With it, she could easily take the guard out right now, before it even\
  \ knew she was here. That was assuredly what Navasi would advise.</p> \n      <p>But\
  \ where was the fun in that?</p> \n      <p>Slinging the rifle over her shoulder,\
  \ she drew her doshko and thumbed it on. Plasma spikes blazed to life with a soft\
  \ hiss.</p> \n      <p>Yes—much better. Last, but most importantly, she pulled out\
  \ her datapad, synched it to her personal coms channel, and cued up <i>Obozaya’\
  s Mayhem Playlist</i>.</p> \n      <p>Immediately, Sylix the Siren’s “Moneythumper”\
  \ began pounding through Obo’s custom sound system, bone conduction carrying it\
  \ not just to her ears, but into her very skeleton.</p> \n      <blockquote> <i>Breaking\
  \ hearts.<br> Breaking heads.<br> I always get my money down in advance...</i> \n\
  \      </blockquote> \n      <p>Gods, what a perfect fight song. A former merc herself,\
  \ Sylix knew just what Obo needed—her voice was a classic Veskarium egg-croon, floating\
  \ over syrupy bass and a tuned kick that hit like an orbital bombardment. Obo’s\
  \ pulse surged.</p> \n      <p>Navasi hated when she did this. And maybe blasting\
  \ tunes on the battlefield <i>wasn’t</i> the best idea when you were trying to coordinate\
  \ with half a dozen squadmates. But for the moment, Obo was on her own, which meant\
  \ she could indulge in a few old habits. If the captain didn’t like it, tough scales—\
  the thing about rescue missions was that the rescuer got to call the shots. And\
  \ Obo was in the mood to enjoy this.</p> \n      <blockquote> <i>Win while you can,<br>\
  \ Then we’ll dance till we’re dead.<br> You’re only living if you’re taking a chance...</i>\
  \ \n      </blockquote> \n      <p><i>You said it, Sylix</i>, Obo thought, and charged\
  \ up over the ridge.</p> \n      <p>The creature—Raia had called it a “mi-go”—was\
  \ fast, but Obo was faster. Her boots churned the rocky soil in time with the pounding\
  \ beat, her tail stretched out behind her for balance. By the time the mi-go noticed\
  \ seven feet of armored lizard bearing down on it and brought its weird spiky gun\
  \ to bear, Obo was already too close. She ducked sideways out of the line of fire\
  \ and brought the doshko up in a sweeping diagonal slice.</p> \n      <div class=\"\

  \ by Alberto Dal Lago</p> \n      </div> \n      <p>The plasma spikes slid home\
  \ with a sizzle, not stopping till the haft was flat against the creature’s side.\
  \ Yet instead of dying, the mi-go just stood there, the doshko’s white-hot spikes\
  \ sending up steam that smelled incongruously like roasted vegetable skewers. Whorls\
  \ of color played across the mi-go’s face as it glanced down at the weapon, then\
  \ back up at Obozaya. </p> \n      <p>“Um.” Obo said.</p> \n      <p>The creature\
  \ fired, the bolt of cold slamming into Obo’s shoulder and sending crackling tendrils\
  \ of frost across her pauldron. Her armor’s thermal regulators kicked in, ceramic\
  \ superconductors safely dispersing the cold across her entire surface area before\
  \ it could freeze the water in her cells. But it was still closer than it ought\
  \ to be. Obo spun aside, lashing out with an ineffective tail sweep.</p> \n    \
  \  <p>Obo’s doshko strike had been flawless—naturally—so it must be that the creature\
  \ was immune to heat and electricity. So much for having some fun with things. Obo\
  \ clicked the doshko off and dropped it, diving into a roll as the mi-go fired again.\
  \ She came up holding her rifle.</p> \n      <p>She fired. Two quick shots, snare-crack\
  \ counterpoints to the bass still pounding in her bones. No point wasting ammo if\
  \ these failed as well.</p> \n      <p>The mi-go’s head snapped backward as magnetically\
  \ accelerated tungsten lanced through armor plating. It screamed in a language that\
  \ was at once totally alien and completely universal.</p> \n      <p>Obo smiled\
  \ and switched to full auto.</p> \n      <p>It was over in less than two seconds.\
  \ The gun hummed against her shoulder as she unloaded the magazine, stitching shots\
  \ across the creature’s chest. A lifetime of training had her slamming home a fresh\
  \ magazine before the spent one had hit the ground, yet even as she reloaded she\
  \ could see that she wouldn’t need it.</p> \n      <p>The mi-go lay sprawled in\
  \ the dust, practically sawn in half by the magnetar’s metal roar. Obo crouched\
  \ over it, rifle leveled at the cave entrance, ready to do the same to any emerging\
  \ monstrosities. When they didn’t immediately appear, she stood and recovered her\
  \ doshko, never letting the magnetar’s barrel stray from its bead on the darkness.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>With a last exhortation to get paid, “Moneythumper” drew to a close,\
  \ replaced by the Aballonian skitterbeats of Godhead Collective’s “You Know Who\
  \ We Are.”</p> \n      <p>“Right,” Obo said, and cued her holoprojector. The glowing\
  \ banner coalesced above her head, rising up from her backpack and unfurling to\
  \ reveal her personal war-glyph.</p> \n      <p>Navasi hated that, too. But what\
  \ was the point of victory if you didn’t get to take credit for it? Anonymity was\
  \ for cowards—better to let everyone know who you were, and if that meant more enemies\
  \ came for you, all the better. Obo was always down to dance.</p> \n      <p>But\
  \ of course, that wasn’t usually her call. Once upon a time, Obo would have laughed\
  \ at the idea of taking orders from someone like Navasi. The captain had style,\
  \ sure, and she could fight like a proper merc when she had to, but her answer to\
  \ everything was <i>talking</i>. The whole team was like that. They didn’t understand\
  \ the glory of single combat, of making a name for yourself by succeeding against\
  \ impossible odds on the battlefield. Half the time they schemed to <i>avoid</i>\
  \ bloodshed! They were everything Damoritosh had taught her to revile. </p> \n \
  \     <p>Obo desperately hoped they were still alive.</p> \n      <p>“Hang tight,\
  \ little friends,” she whispered. “Obo’s coming for you.”</p> \n      <p>Rifle barrel\
  \ leading the way, she stepped into the darkness.</p> \n      <p style=\"font-weight:\
