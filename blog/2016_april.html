<p>This week's <a href = "/pathfinderbattles">Pathfinder Battles</a> preview reveals two of my favorite figures in October's <a href = "/products/btpy9kcu"><em>Deadly Foes</em></a> set, both of whom very much live up to their name.</p>

<p>The Fire Diabolist is one of my favorite illustrations from the <a href = "/products/btpy8v3a"><em>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: NPC Codex</em></a>, which continues to be a great source of images for the <a href = "/pathfinderbattles">Pathfinder Battles</a> line. This 20th-level cleric of Asmodeus (!!!) comes ready to rumble with a killer mace and a sturdy shield. The Fire Diabolist is a Medium, rare figure who would probably prefer to cook your player characters all the way to well done!</p>

<p>That's it for this week. Swing by in seven days for another look at what WizKids has in store in October's <a href = "/products/btpy9kcu"><em>Deadly Foes</em></a> set!</p>

<p>Until then, I remain...</p>

<p>The <a href = "/paizocon/events">PaizoCon 2016 Event Schedule</a> is live!</p>

<p itemprop="description">With nearly 300 events over 4 days, including exclusive lottery games, seminars, panels, and one-of-a-kind workshops, <a href = "/paizocon">PaizoCon 2016</a> has something for nearly every gamer to get excited about!

<p>PaizoCon attendees can also start entering their preferences for the PaizoCon Event Lottery <a href = "/paizocon/events"><b><i>right now</i></b></a>! The lottery includes games and workshops with limited seating, as well as the Pathfinder Society special. It does not include panels, large seminars, or any the regular Pathfinder Society tables. Preference selections can be made until <b>Monday, May 9 at 12:00 PM Pacific time</b>.</p>

<p>The PaizoCon Event Lottery results will be available on <b>Wednesday, May 11 at 12:00 PM Pacific time</b>. This is also when Open Registration and Event Trading begins, so you'll be able to register for non-lottery events, or swap seats with other attendees for events you may have gotten in the lottery.</p>

<p>Still confused about this whole "lottery" thing? We have a <a href = "/threads/rzs2tmnw">dedicated thread explaining the lottery process, buddy system, open registration, and event trading</a> just for newcomers!</p>

<p>Haven't picked up a badge yet? Go ahead and grab yourself a <a href = "/paizocon">4-Day Badge</a> and get your selections for events in now! We also have a Kid's 4-Day Badge option for attendees 10 and under, as well as Banquet Tickets that are sold individually.</p>

<p itemprop="description">The final issue of <a href = "/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics/hollowMountain">Pathfinder: Hollow Mountain</a> releases today, written by yours truly and drawn by the illustrious Sean Izaakse! Can Pathfinder's most heroic and villainous iconics overcome their differences long enough to defeat the demonic Castellan? Will Ezren teach Seltyiel the true value of friendship? Will Oloch and Valeros finally kiss? There's only one way to find out, and it's hitting your local comics shop as we speak!</p>

<p>It's been a blast writing this series with Erik and Wes, and while all three of us worked closely together to chart out the storyline and character arcs, it was extra fun to get to write the first and last issues&mdash;both setting the stage and then tying up all the loose threads. But writing a Pathfinder comic isn't all fun and games&mdash;or rather, the games aren't all fun. A lot of work goes into making sure that everything the characters do in the comics fits within the game rules and character abilities, and the review board of me, Wes, Erik, and Jacobs is merciless when it comes to making comic authors toe the line.</p>

<p>This issue in particular has a lot of magic flying around&mdash;so much so that Wes suggested I take a page of the raw script and post it up here for you to see what goes on behind the scenes. So if you've ever wondered what a comic script looks like, here's an example! (I guess I should add a spoiler warning, but this particular page was chosen to avoid revealing too much. Unless you consider "folks beat the dickens out of other folks" to be a revealing too much.)</p>

<p>Hope you enjoy this peek behind the curtain, and thanks for supporting the comics!</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline">Obsidian Tells a Tale</h1>

<p class="date">Tuesday, April 26, 2016</p>

<div itemprop="articlebody">

<p>With <em>Pathfinder Adventures</em>' imminent release—Thursday, April 28!—it's time we talked about the core strength of both Pathfinder and Obsidian: storytelling.</p>

<p itemprop="description">When Obsidian Entertainment and Paizo started talking about <em>Pathfinder Adventures</em>, I was most excited about the prospect of bringing the story of <a href = "/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/riseOfTheRunelords"><em>Rise of the Runelords</em></a> to life.  A little background: I started at Obsidian in 2007 working on <em>Neverwinter Nights 2: Mask of the Betrayer</em>, and one of the first things I did was join a group of coworkers playing <em>Rise of the Runelords</em>. The story stuck with me. And when I started playing "Burnt Offerings" in the <a href = "/pathfinder/adventureCardGame">Pathfinder Adventure Card Game</a>, it all came flooding back. I loved the way Mike Selinker, Chad Brown, and all of the designers at Lone Shark Games used the mechanics of the cards to tell a story. Local Heroes stood out to me right away, as did Foul Misgivings later. Since story has always been a priority at Obsidian, I knew that we could bring the theme and drama of the Adventure Path to the forefront of the digital version.</p>

<p>As mentioned in <a href = "/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lhd2">my first blog</a>, one of the first things we did was put all of the location decks on a map. This helps gives the game instant context and setting without a word being written. As an example, throughout "Burnt Offerings," you were playing in bright and sunny Sandpoint, but when you start "The Skinsaw Murders," things look a little different...</p>

<div class="blurbCenter"><a href="/image/content/PathfinderACG/20160426-Blog1.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderACG/20160426-Blog1_360.jpeg"></a><br />
<i><a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgOA24hAe60" target = "_blank">Workin' on our night moves</a> (yeah, you just got Bob Segered).</i></div>

<p>It's Sandpoint's nighttime look! And it's a good one. Since "The Skinsaw Murders" is a ghost story and a murder mystery, we decided to set the mood.</p>

<p>Where PACG uses text descriptions on the cards to convey the story, we use dialogue. Most of these conversations are driven by the iconic heroes that you choose to play with. Each of the iconics has a distinct voice, so a party of Ezren and Valeros experiences different dialogue than a party of Seoni and Amiri.</p>

<p>Before setting out to write dialogue for RotR's 11 iconic heroes, I worked with Erik Mona and James Jacobs at Paizo (with some helpful insight from Chris Avellone and Matt MacLean at Obsidian) to develop a Character Bible. I use it as a touchstone each time I write to make sure the characters are always true to themselves. Each character has a set of style and story notes to remind me how they speak and how they will develop.</p>

<p>I'll pull back the curtain and show you (most of) Lini's entry:</p>

<blockquote>
<h3>Style</h3>
<p>Having an intimate relationship with animals, Lini sees the world from an animal's perspective. She has a hard time understanding people and their complicated schemes, but she is curious about them. She has tremendous instincts and will trust or mistrust NPCs with a high level of accuracy (<b>[REDACTED]</b> will always smell wrong and Ameiko will be a fast friend). She does not emote in half-measures. She's excitable and fiery, using short declarative sentences for just about every occasion. Dank dungeons make her uncomfortable, but she'll never abandon her pack or the mission in front of her.</p>
<p>She will have a habit of interrupting villainous taunts to attack with an "Aaah-Kii-Yeee!"</p>

<h3>Story Notes</h3>
<p>She will seem naive at first, not understanding man's cruelty. Her curiosity will continue to drive her though. She will grow to see mankind and those with powers as complex, yet simple as any other force of nature. In Chapters 5 and 6, Lini will have a very specific understanding of what she sees and experiences and will always know with certainty what she must to do to flow with or fight against anything she is faced with.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When each scenario starts and ends, you'll get dialogue that's reactive to the characters you have in your party. Likewise, when you fight the villain for the first time, you'll get some banter determined by who's fighting the villain.</p>

<p>Let's take Crow Bait as an example. Harsk is adventuring solo and having a productive discussion with Ameiko about the Sihedron rune when Maester Grump interrupts with terrible news.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20160426-Blog2.jpg"><img src = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20160426-Blog2_360.jpeg"></a><br />
<i>They even ate the dogs!</i></div>
 
<p>Harsk will get down to the bottom of it! At various points throughout the game, we'll check to see what cards you have and add a little extra flavor. The game does a quick check of his deck and notes that he has the beloved Deathbane Light Crossbow +1. So he adds:</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20160426-Blog3.jpg"><img src = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20160426-Blog3_360.jpeg"></a><br />
<i>Nothing beats the old Deathbane!</i></div>

<p>Harsk comes upon the Farmhouse location. In most scenarios, it's just a country home. In Crow Bait, it's a gruesome scene with a creepy note addressed to Harsk.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20160426-Blog4.jpg"><img src = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20160426-Blog4_360.jpeg"></a><br />
<i>The letter reads, "You, and you alone, have brought this fearful harvest. They are dead because of you, and more shall join them soon."</i></div>
 
<p>Soon enough, he finds Rogors Craesby, who discusses his ugly intentions:</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20160426-Blog5.jpg"><img src = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20160426-Blog5_360.jpeg"></a><br />
<i>Harsk is no creature's breakfast.</i></div>
 
<p>When all is said and done, Harsk considers what has happened and how it relates to the larger plot:</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20160426-Blog6.jpg"><img src = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20160426-Blog6_360.jpeg"></a><br />
<i>Harsk thinks in terms of tactics and the hunt.</i></div>
 
<p>Where there are opportunities for flavor or exposition, we take them. Certain henchmen will talk with you before they fight. Some ally cards in your deck provide good opportunities as well.</p>

<p>And the haunts in Foul Misgivings! Let me tell you about the haunts. Better yet, let me show you!</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20160426-Blog7.jpg"><img src = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20160426-Blog7_360.jpeg"></a><br />
<i>In case you didn't know, RotR gets dark! Credit for this amazing art goes to the incomparable Lindsey Laney.</i></div>
 
<p>There are eight unique haunts throughout the Foul Misgivings&mdash;so many that it's impossible to see all of them in one play through the scenario.</p>

<p>You can be sure that there are a great number of things that I've left out for the sake of spoilers and easter egg hunts. I will say that we track a specific action in Burnt Offerings that has implications in The Skinsaw Murders. And I can't wait to show you what we do with Here Comes the Flood!</p>

<p>I really enjoy incorporating all levels of play into these storylines, and this month level 1-5 PCs experience a major piece of the action in <a href = "/products/btpy9k94"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #7-21: The Sun Orchid Scheme</em></a> by the winner of <a href = "/rpgsuperstar">RPG Superstar Season 9</a>, Nicholas Wasko. Pashow is ready to perform a test run of their operation, and knowing the Society's reputation for troubleshooting tough problems, the city-state's emir and the visiting dignitary Princess Ziralia (pictured here) has contracted a team of Pathfinders to perform a non-lethal raid on one of the convoys. Hopefully the PCs can uncover any weaknesses in the convoy's defenses before the real deal. Then again, when has anything gone according to plan? Nick has written a thrilling adventure with some great twists, and I'm now all the more excited for the module he'll be writing in the future.</p>

<p>Finally adventuring in Thuvia is exciting. Finally releasing true seeker-level content is exciting. Combining the two was almost more than I could handle, so I called in Thurston Hillman as reinforcements. He's crafted a rousing and challenging adventure befitting Tier 12-15 with <a href = "/products/btpy9k93"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #7-20: All for Immortality, Part 1: First Taste of Eternity</em></a>. The convoys carrying the sun orchid elixir have left the Citadel of the Alchemist, and Pashow's enemies are closing in. Fortunately, the PCs are on hand to help where the fighting's hottest, but they're due to uncover&mdash;and resolve&mdash;an even greater threat in the process. This adventure has one of my favorite depictions of a new villain, but I'm loath to post it here because it would spoil the surprise. I'll just let Thurston's writing and Sebastian Rodriguez's art speak for themselves when you get a chance to play this first of three adventures.</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline">Good Bad Dogs</h1>
<p class="date">Friday, April 22, 2016</p>

<div itemprop="articlebody">

<p itemprop="description">It's been a long week of hard work and hard business travel (ok, fun business travel), so at the end of the day here on Friday, the thing I'm most looking forward to doing is heading home and hanging out with my dog. I got my first pet&mdash;a wonderfully chubby pug named Tiny&mdash;about 5 years ago. Before that I didn't really understand compassion. While I always (sort of) enjoyed hanging out with my friends' dogs, I never knew why people liked them so much. Then I got one of my own, my heart melted, and I guess you could say I'm a better man than I ever was before.</p>

<div class="blurbCenter"><a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160422-Tiny.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160422-Tiny_360.jpeg"></a></div>

<p>But the thing is, not all dogs are as awesome as my little Tiny. Some of them are right bastards.</p>

<p>For this week's preview, we're taking a look at two terrible canines from October's <a href = "/products/btpy9kcu"><em>Deadly Foes</em></a> set of <a href = "/pathfinderbattles">Pathfinder Battles</a> prepainted plastic miniatures. Bring your pepper spray and choke chains, and most importantly, BEWARE OF DOG!</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160422-Cerberi.jpg"><img src = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160422-Cerberi_360.jpeg" /></a></div>

<p>Up first this week is the Cerberi, a nasty three-headed dog from the pages of <em>Pathfinder RPG: Bestiary 3</em>. Based on the mythical guard dogs of Hell, these outsiders can dimensionally anchor an enemy with a bite, and their three noses are particularly good at sniffing out undead. Of course, they're lawful evil, so they aren't so great with the living, either. The Cerberi is a Medium, uncommon figure.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160422-HellHound.jpg"><img src = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160422-HellHound_360.jpeg" /></a></div>

<p>Bad dogs travel best in packs, and when you're talking about dogs from Hell like the Cerberi, you've got to also talk about the original hounds of hell&mdash;hell hounds! This charming fellow is the Advanced Hell Hound, a Large and more imposing version of the original creature (whom we included in the <em>Shattered Star</em> set). I've included a side view, as the flames coming out of this guy's mouth make it a little difficult to interpret from straight-on. Either way, this guy is sure to light a fire under the feet of your player characters. The Advanced Hell Hound is a Large, uncommon figure.</p>

<p>And that's it for this week! Join us in seven days for another look ahead at the villains, heroes, and monsters of <a href = "/products/btpy9kcu"><em>Deadly Foes</em></a>!</p>

<p>Until then, I remain...</p>

<div itemprop="articlebody">

<p itemprop="description"><a href = "/paizocon">PaizoCon 2016</a> is just a little over a month away, and we're all busy making preparations for our favorite convention of the year. Whether you're a first-time visitor to the Seattle area, or a PaizoCon veteran, here's a few things to do in the area before, during, and after the convention!</p>

<h2>Movement Speed</h2>
<p>If you are not renting a car, and you're not using an allied NPC boon for local travel, the DoubleTree Hotel is conveniently located right on the A Line Express of King County's Metro bus system. Just up the street is also the light rail which leads directly to downtown, which is going to be your best way to get to the sights of Seattle. The most affordable way for out-of-town visitors to view the area is to pick up a <a href = "http://metro.kingcounty.gov/fares/index.html#types-of-fares" target = "_blank">Regional Day Pass</a>, which can be purchased at the light rail station for $8 for unlimited rides (for fares up to $3.50). The challenge rating of facing the local highway system is mighty&mdash;use public transportation and carpool as much as possible! For planning out your travels, Google Maps and One Bus Away has been the most reliable for public transportation arrival and departure times.</p>

<h2>Gazetteer of Seattle</h2>

<p>When I first came to live on the moister side of the Pacific Northwest, I had an excellent guide to show me the way (thanks, Cosmo). Now I am passing on some of the locations that I enjoy in the area, and if you are arriving early for PaizoCon, see the sights of the Emerald City! A fair warning: Seattle is quite hilly, and some spots are very steep. PaizoCon Founder Tim Nightengale recommends that you visit <a href = "http://www.seattleattractions.com/" target = "_blank">Seattle Premier Attactions</a> for a broader overview of what you can see, but here are my favorites.
<ul>
<li><strong><a href = "http://pikeplacemarket.org/" target = "_blank">Pike Place Market</a></strong>: In operation since 1907, this is a multi-level market that you've probably seen on TV where the folks throwing the fish around. It is less busy during the week before noon, so keep that in mind, and that you'll want to bring cash here, as not all the places accept credit or debit card. If you're a foodie, don't miss Beecher's Handmade Cheese, Daily Dozen Doughnut Company, DeLaurenti, Ellenos Yogurt, Market Spice, Piroshky Piroshky, the "original" Starbucks, and World Spice. There are dozens of different stores in Pike Place, not to mention a comic book store&mdash;spend some time meandering!</li>
<li><strong><a href = "http://www.pioneersquare.org/" target = "_blank">Pioneer Square</a></strong>: One of the oldest neighborhoods in Seattle, built in 1857, there is quite a bit of local history to discover here, including King Street Station and the Klondike Gold Rush National Historical Park. Don't miss the <a href = "http://www.undergroundtour.com/" target = "_blank">Underground Tour</a>!</li>
<li><strong><a href = "http://www.seattleaquarium.org/" target = "_blank">Seattle Aquarium</a></strong>: I have it on good authority from an enthusiastic three year old that this is the best. Jellyfish, octopi, otters, seals, tide pools and an underwater dome are some of the features here. Seagulls can be seen all around Seattle for free!</li>
<li><strong><a href = "http://www.seattlecenter.com/" target = "_blank">Seattle Center</a></strong>: There are not one, but <em>multiple things</em> to do in this encounter. The <a href = "http://www.empmuseum.org/" target = "_blank">EMP Museum</a> is more than just music (though there is a lot of that too, and the guitar exhibit is quite stunning), and the <a href = "https://www.pacificsciencecenter.org/" target = "_blank">Pacific Science Center</a> has multiple attractions (including a <a href = "https://www.pacificsciencecenter.org/the-art-of-the-brick/" target = "_blank">LEGO&reg; exhibit starting on May 28th</a>), and the Seattle Center is also home to the <a href = "http://www.spaceneedle.com/home/" target = "_blank">iconic Space Needle</a>. Whether or not Chihuly was contacted from Things Beyond Space and Time is a matter of some debate, but <a href = "http://www.chihulygardenandglass.com/" target = "_blank">Chihuly Garden & Glass</a> is full of inspirational mind-bending art. The easiest way to get to the Seattle Center is by the Monorail from Westlake. If you're planning on attending multiple museums at the Seattle Center or around town, check out the <a href = "http://www.citypass.com/seattle" target = "_blank">Citypass</a>!</li>
</ul>
Other strong contenders for things to see and do in Seattle: the International District, Ivar's, Molly Moon's Ice Cream, <a href = "http://www.seattleartmuseum.org/" target = "_blank">Seattle Art Museum</a> (check out the Roman glassware and Native American collections), Seattle Great Wheel, and probably at least a dozen other places that I'm forgetting. If you get lost, Pike and Pine streets are great fixtures to orient yourself, as is the Washington State Convention Center and Westlake Center. In a pinch, just head downhill towards the water.</p>

<p>Many have asked this question, but this is a good spot to say this again: we do not offer tours of the Paizo offices, sorry!</p>

<li>QFC, 17847 1st Avenue South, Normandy Park, WA 98148 (2.5 miles, open 24 hours)</li>

<h2>3, 2, 1&mdash;Let's Jam!</h2>
<p>Alright, it's convention time! I know you might not want to hear it, but give yourself a little bit of extra time to prepare yourself and get a bite and a cuppa joe in before your day starts. (And for all of the volunteers that arise to run at this hour, thank you!) A little bit of courtesy goes a long way, so please be kind to the hotel NPCs when gathering with your party. If this is your first convention ever, well, thank you for picking ours! Here's a few convention tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wear comfortable, broken-in shoes, and bring an extra pair. Your feet will thank you.</li>
<li>Bring extra socks.</li>
<li>Stay hydrated&mdash;there is no substitute for water.</li>
<li>Bring a non-sugary snack to keep your energy levels up.</li>
<li>A minimum of 3 hours of sleep, two real meals, and one shower. In the <a href = "/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lds5">words of Erik Mona</a>, "Man cannot survive on gaming, booze, and 5-Hour Energy alone (trust me, I've tried)."</li>
<li>Don't completely fill your schedule&mdash;give yourself some downtime.</li>
<li>Make new friends.</li>
<li>For freelancers and would-be freelancers, bring a business card (and leave some room to write notes on).</li>
<li>Don't forget the dice.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>ConCrud</h2>
<p>It happens&mdash;you know it, we know it. Wash your hands, cover your mouth, stay hydrated, eat proper meals, get some rest&mdash;these give you a bonus to your Fortitude save to help from spreading Urgathoa's touch.</p>

<p>Got any additional questions? Concerns? Musings? Want to know other favorite haunts that we like? Ask away in the the discussion thread!</p>

<p>Getting the dire ducklings in a row,</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline">Knockin' on Heaven's Door</h1>
<p class="date">Wednesday, April 20, 2016</p>

<div itemprop="articlebody">

<div class="blurb180"><a href="/products/btpy9jbd"><img src="/image/product/catalog/PZO/PZO9291_180.jpeg"></a></div>

<p itemprop="description">In celebration of the release of <a href = "/products/btpy9jbd"><em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Heaven Unleashed</em></a>, I wanted to take a moment as one of the biggest fans of Heaven on the Paizo development staff to reveal a never-before-seen, behind-the-scenes peek at how exactly we went about building the great mountain of Heaven!</p>

<p>As is often the case at Paizo, we didn't build it all at once. For many years, we had dropped hints and brief descriptions of different locations within it, or discussed it in broad terms. While we had given the plane a very rough outline back in a book called The Great Beyond, that was one of the first setting books we ever did, and frankly we were still figuring a lot of things out back in those days and had no concept yet just how important Pathfinder's setting would become. (To give you a sense of how long ago that was: the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game didn't exist yet, folks currently running the adventure paths hadn't even started freelancing for Paizo, and Wes didn't yet have any stress-induced gray hair.) Since then, we'd revisited the plane various times&mdash;for instance, I got to explore the Great Library and Heathen Shore (Heaven's international district) in <a href = "/products/btpy94r3"><em>The Redemption Engine</em></a>&mdash;but we'd never sat down and really hashed out a full outline of the plane.</p>

<p>While <a href = "/products/btpy9jbd"><em>Heaven Unleashed</em></a> is mostly a big book of cool encounters tied to Heaven, it was important to us to finally give a comprehensive overview of the plane&mdash;what the various layers are, who runs what, etc. So several of us sat down and brain-melded to try and figure out how to weave existing canon and new stuff together to create a framework for Heaven. There was plenty of pressure, for as Wes pointed out, a well-designed Heaven ought to be just as cool as Hell, especially since they're in many ways mirror reflections of each other. (Plus, it had always felt like a shame to both of us that everyone reads Dante's Inferno, but not even hardcore planar fans can be bothered to finish Paradiso...)</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20160420-Whiteboard.jpg"><img src = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20160420-Whiteboard_500.jpeg"></a></div>

<p>The result was this whiteboard sketch, with each of Heaven's seven's layers charted out. Here you can see our thoughts on the function of each layer and which souls go where, as well as our metaphysical musings about how the souls residing on certain layers "face outward," others face inward, and still others face beyond, toward Heaven's role in the multiverse. (We go down all sorts of theosophical rabbit holes around here.) And of course, there are the names of the layers, the identities and titles of the rulers of each layer, which gods live where... all the basics you need to know as a scholar of Heaven or just someone looking to petition the gods or kick some angelic ass.</p>

<p>You'll also notice a bunch of green boxes on the board. Those were for those layers or rulers who hadn't been named or decided yet when I took this picture. We've figured things out since then, of course, and I'm happy to say that I think we achieved our goal of making Heaven just as interesting as its unholy sister plane. But if you want to know the rest of the details... well, that's what the book is for, now isn't it?</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline">Class Decks by the Score</h1>

<p class="date">Tuesday, April 19, 2016</p>

<div itemprop="articlebody">

<p itemprop="description">Yesterday, we sent our printer Cartamundi four more <a href = "/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/classDecks">Pathfinder Adventure Card Game Class Decks</a>, bringing our total of class decks to 20. With such an auspicious number in the books, I thought it'd be nice to look back on our designs&mdash;even though you've only seen 13 of them to date. So this is both a review and a preview.</p>

<p>Oh, hey, the important thing: Ace designer Tanis O'Connor led the design of all of these. All of Lone Shark Games' designers helped, of course, but we've been very lucky to be working under Tanis's singular vision for the whole line. Yay, Tanis!</p>

<p>Okay, I mentioned in <a href = "/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lime">a recent blog</a> that we design these in "waves." That certainly surprised a few people. I expect folks imagined that on the first of every month, we flip the page on our <a href = " http://andrewsmcmeel.com/catalog/detail?sku=9781449465209" target = "_blank">Dog Shaming Calendar</a>, say "Oh, Bonzo, will you never learn?" and then design a class deck. That's not really how we work. Instead, we tackle a big project with lots of sub-projects all at once, so we can see the whole picture. And then we bang on it over several months until it's done. Then Vic says, "You have to turn it over to me now," and the wave gets edited, illustrated, proofed, printed, and sent to you. Lather, rinse, repeat.</p>

<p>Here's a wave-by-wave look at the decks.</p>

<h2>Wave 1: The "Big Seven"</h2>
<p>As we were wrapping up <a href = "/products/btpy92zj">Skull & Shackles</a>, we decided to get our feet wet with a set of seven initial decks. Wait, that's not true at all. We decided to do the eleven core iconics' decks all at once, but then our internal gaskets blew into pieces, and we scaled back. Seven was all our diminutive brains could handle in one wave.</p>

<p>Exactly which seven? Our choices mirrored the <a href = "/products/btpy951a"><em>Rise of the Runelords Base Set</em></a>'s characters&mdash;<a href = "/products/btpy97i9">Bard</a>, <a href = "/products/btpy97ia">Cleric</a>, <a href = "/products/btpy97ib">Fighter</a>, <a href = "/products/btpy97ic">Ranger</a>, <a href = "/products/btpy97id">Rogue</a>, <a href = "/products/btpy97ie">Sorcerer</a>, and <a href = "/products/btpy97if">Wizard</a>&mdash;and established a principle that you could use the deck to grow your character over an entire Adventure Path. At this point, we only had the first two sets' cards to draw from, and we hadn't actually seen folks play with Skull & Shackles in the wild. We decided on a core ethic, though: These decks would be usable with any Adventure Path. So no cards that worked in only one set.</p>

<p>Our primary resource for ideas the <a href = "/products/btpy8v3a"><em>Pathfinder RPG NPC Codex</em></a>. That supplement expanded our minds as to what a character of a class could be. A key exemplar of this idea is Flenta, the fighter who wants everyone to believe she's a wizard. We could never make that our fighter archetype. But in the <em>Fighter Class Deck</em>, we could use the principles of fighterdom to make a new kind of hybrid character that showed off how robust our system was.</p>

<div class="blurbCenter"><a href="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6801-MarkedCards.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6801-MarkedCards_180.jpeg"></a>
<a href = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6803-Masterwork.jpg"><img src = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6803-Masterwork_180.jpeg"></a>
<a href = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6805-BlackMarshSpiderVenom.jpg"><img src = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6805-BlackMarshSpiderVenom_180.jpeg"></a></div>

<p>We also wove subthemes into the deck. For example, we gave rogues Meliski and Wu Shen some new Poison cards, and the ability to do some fancy trickery with them. We wove our first Gambling items throughout the set, a lucky Rabbit's Foot here and a set of Marked Cards there. We seeded things we hoped to do more ornately later, such as <a href = "/blog/v5748dyo5lhem">Darago's window on what would become Balazar</a>.</p>

<p>If there was any legit critique of those first seven decks, it's that we were trying to do too much. So for example, the <em>Cleric Class Deck</em> found Tarlin and Zarlova fighting for space to get 2-Handed weapons and Arcane/Divine spells. That seemed untenable. Something had to give.</p>

<h2>Wave 2: The Expanded (and Condensed) Roster</h2>
<p>After taking some time to see the first wave in play, we made some changes. Wave 2 encompassed <a href = "/products/btpy9cu9">Paladin</a>, <a href = "/products/btpy9dyj">Monk</a>, and <a href = "/products/btpy9dyj">Druid</a>, three of the four classes that originally appeared in the <a href = "/products/btpy91un"><em>Rise of the Runelords Character Add-On Deck</em></a>. The most obvious change was dropping from four characters to three, each of whom could now have a full complement of tools to exploit.</p>

<p>Plus we introduced some characters who would look really out of place in the <a href = "/products/btpy8osv"><em>Pathfinder RPG Beginner Box</em></a>: Rooboo the tengu monk, Raz the dog-riding paladin, and Gronk the elf druid who spent most of his time as a tree. You wanted variety, we gave you variety.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6808-Retriever.jpg"><img src = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6808-Retriever_180.jpeg"></a>
<a href = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6809-VenonmousFightingFan.jpg"><img src = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6809-VenonmousFightingFan_180.jpeg"></a>
<a href = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6810-FruitOfLife.jpg"><img src = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6810-FruitOfLife_180.jpeg"></a></div>

<p>In addition to introducing cards from <a href = "/products/btpy9a46">Wrath of the Righteous</a>, we started relying more heavily on "cycles," sets of cards that introduced variants on a central theme running through the deck. The <em>Monk Class Deck</em>, for example, got a whole bunch of new Asian-themed weapons, all of which work with the Acrobatics skill that Monks are known for.</p>

<p>The key element of this set: surprises. We wanted you to open up the deck and think, "Wow, I didn't see that coming."</p>

<h2>Wave 3: Crazytimes Begin</h2>
<p>OK, Amiri's waiting this whole time saying, "I was in Runelords too! What's a frost-giant-sword-slinging girl gotta do to get in a class deck?" Best for last, I say. Her time finally came, as wave 3 began with <a href = "/products/btpy9e8d">Barbarian</a>, followed by <a href = "/products/btpy9ezo">Oracle</a> and <a href = "/products/btpy9fqi">Alchemist</a>.</p>

<p>Hoo boy, we jumped quite a ways out of the box here. The <em>Barbarian Class Deck</em> has two great cycles, the war paint cycle (in which you decide what color to paint your face and gain superpowers from it) and the improvised cycle (in which you decide what random thing to smash your foes with). Plus, we debuted the first character for the game based on a Paizo employee's home character: Erik Mona's Ostog the Unslain. (Try to keep him that way.)</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6811-OrangeWarPaint.jpg"><img src = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6811-OrangeWarPaint_180.jpeg"></a>
<a href = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6812-BlessingOfOsiris.jpg"><img src = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6812-BlessingOfOsiris_180.jpeg"></a>
<a href = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6813-StainedGlassElemental.jpg"><img src = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6813-StainedGlassElemental_180.jpeg"></a></div>

<p>In addition to a blind woman in a Rio Carnival outfit, the Oracle deck had a lizardfolk <i>AND</i> a pitborn. Grazzle and Ramexes divined things the fun way: using bones and entrails. This deck also gave the first previews of cards from our upcoming Mummy's Mask set, including some wild Egyptian blessings.</p>

<p>And where the <em>Oracle Class Deck</em> opened the door, the <em>Alchemist Class Deck</em> melted it off its hinges. The deck featured bombs, elementals, and the weirdest armor you've ever seen from us. <i>(Spoiler: The Mummy's Mask team likes weird armor.)</i> But most interesting of all was a cycle of "allies" you probably didn't imagine we'd make: oozes, slimes, and jellies. If these are Mother Myrtle's friends, I don't want to see her enemies.</p>

<h2>Wave 4: New Old Tricks</h2>
<p>By wave 4, we wanted to use some of the cool tricks we designed for Skull & Shackles and Wrath of the Righteous. This wave&mdash;<a href = "/products/btpy9gdq">Inquisitor</a>, <a href = "/products/btpy9icp">Witch</a>, and <a href = "/products/btpy9ipq">Gunslinger</a>&mdash;use rules we'd restricted ourselves from using in previous sets.</p>

<p>For example, check out this card from the <em>Inquisitor Class Deck</em>, Detect Thoughts.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6814-DetectThoughts.jpg"><img src = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6814-DetectThoughts_180.jpeg"></a></div>

<p>See that little "if you have a role card" dodge in there? That's a spell that grows with you. You might hold on to that Adventure Deck 2 spell well through Adventure Deck 4 if you know it's gonna pick up allies after you get that role card. Thanks, Wrath of the Righteous mythic path cards, for teaching us that little trick.</p>

<p>The <em>Witch Class Deck</em> makes particularly great use of Wrath's cohort rules, maybe the cleverest stuff we've done with that card type. And the <em>Gunslinger Class Deck</em> (created in Wave 4, but due to be released <i>after</i> the next two decks I'm gonna talk about) takes some guns from Skull & Shackles and adds card after card of brand-new explosiveness.</p>

<h2>Wave 5: Goblins in the Machinery</h2>
<p>By now you know that we're breaking from our traditional class-driven format to roll out some goblin buffoonery. <a href = "/products/btpy9jcw"><em>Goblins Fight!</em></a> and <a href = "/products/btpy9k5m"><em>Goblins Burn!</em></a> are straight-up ridiculous, but as with all the other decks, they're fully playable in the <a href = "/pfsacg">Pathfinder Adventure Card Guild</a>. These decks are... not kind to the goblins in question. You will see lots of goblins blown up, impaled, and/or turned into ooze. But y'know, in a <i>good</i> way. The crude little buggers really wanted to invade Gen Con, so they muscled their way in front of the <em>Gunslinger Class Deck</em> from the previous wave to make that happen.</p>

<p>Wave 5 also includes two of our most intricate decks, <a href = "/products/btpy9l3e">Warpriest,</a> and (hey, I'm announcing this right now) Summoner. If you've played Oloch or Balazar, you know that you have to read those characters closely before diving in&mdash;there's a lot of "there" in there. And if you like that, you'll like these. The allies in these sets are some of the most interesting ones we've made.</p>

<p>As for the <em>Summoner Class Deck</em> in particular, I have never seen us stress so much over the complex interaction of a character and corresponding Owner card before. Probably took us thirty tries to get it right. But that's a story for another day.</p>

<p>So that's the score on the score of class decks we've sent to the printer to date. By the time the <em>Summoner Class Deck</em> comes out, Class Decks will have added more than 130 different character/role combos to PACG play.</p>

<p>One more thing...</p>

<p>When we were designing the goblin decks, we kept thinking about some of the goblin-themed promo cards we created for previous Adventure Paths, and how they'd go really nicely with these two decks. So Paizo dug into their warehouse and emerged with enough copies of these promos to cover Class Deck subscribers. For the first time, Class Deck subscribers are going to get some of that sweet, sweet promo card love. Subscription copies of <em>Goblins Fight!</em> will ship with the item Goblin Lockpick and a Blessing of Zogmugot (both Skull & Shackles promos), and <em>Goblins Burn!</em> will ship with the spell Fire Sneeze (a Rise of the Runelords promo) and <i>another</i> Blessing of Zogmugot. These are not reprints&mdash;these are the very same printings as the copies that have sometimes sold on eBay for more than the price of the decks we'll be shipping them with (so the cut and color of Fire Sneeze in particular is slightly different from the cards we print today).</p>

<p>If you haven't already signed up for a <a href = "/products/btpy9ewj">Class Deck Subscription</a>, there has never been a better time. And if you already have a subscription, thank you for that... and get ready for a whole lot of strangeness!</p>

After all, we love making PaizoCon special by running unique games and providing other great content to make your trip to Seattle as fun as possible.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Adventure Card Game Open Playtest (Lottery Event):</b> Last year, Adventure Card Game Designer Tanis O'Conner masterminded a way to play the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game competitively, working as a team to outclass the other groups playing the same adventure. She'll be running playtests of this year's adventure (set to debut at Gen Con 2016), and this is your chance to be her nefarious guinea pigs. Your infernal insights disqualify you from participating in the Open at Gen Con, but you will have the diabolical satisfaction of watching the competitors brave the challenges you helped shape.</p>

<p><b>Adventure Card Game: We Be Goblins! (Lottery Event):</b> ACG enthusiast Tyler Beck has worked with Tanis to create a three-part adaptation of the wildly popular We Be Goblins! series of adventures, complete with new characters and custom cards printed through <a href = "http://drivethrucards.com/builder/pathfinder" target = "_blank">DriveThruCards</a>. There will be several rounds of this 4-hour PaizoCon exclusive, but seats are sure to go quickly!</p>

<p><b>Pathfinder Society Special #7-98: Serpents' Ire (Lottery Event with 35 tables):</b> At PaizoCon 2015 players portrayed Aspis agents bent on wrecking the Grand Lodge. This year we're getting half the team back together&mdash;and adding some devious new faces&mdash;in order to infiltrate and destroy a new target: the Korholm Agenda. Step into the role of an 8th-level pregenerated scoundrel on Sunday evening.</p>

<p><b>PaizoCon Banquet (Ticketed Event):</b> Following PaizoCon tradition, Paizo employees join fans for a great meal, and then we gather ‘round to hear what products are coming up over the next year. Expect some big news from the Pathfinder Society team, including the announcement of the next Roleplaying Guild season.</p>

<p><b>Pathfinder Society Q&A Seminar (Open Event):</b> No doubt you have burning questions from the banquet, so the following day Tonya, Linda, and I will take your questions during the Pathfinder Society Q&A panel.</p>

<p><b>Out of Retirement / Season 0 Reborn (Lottery Events):</b> The Out of Retirement tradition continues, giving a select group of players the chance to experience one of the retired Season 0 adventure renovated with full Pathfinder RPG stats and updated Chronicle sheets for full organized play credit. This year I'm running a slight variation on this event called Season 0 Reborn, in which I update one of the other Season 0 scenarios with all the extra goodies. As an added benefit, you can get organized play credit for these revised scenarios at PaizoCon, even if you already played the original versions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We also know that GMs appreciate as much warning as possible about what maps to expect&mdash;especially when preparing for big events like PaizoCon. I've provided a list below of the published maps expected to appear in the April and May scenarios. As a note, the map list for <em>Pathfinder Society Special: #7-98: Serpents' Ire</em> is still being finalized, and I'll post that information in its product page once that's settled.</p>

<p itemprop="description">Hard to believe it's already Friday, which also means it's already time for another sneak peek at new minis from the upcoming <a href = "/products/btpy9kcu"><em>Deadly Foes</em></a> set of prepainted plastic <a href = "/pathfinderbattles">Pathfinder Battles</a> gaming figures from our friends at WizKids! This week I've decided to focus on two winged figures, one quite small, and the other very large!  Let's take to the air and see what all the fuss is about!</p>

<div class="blurbCenter"><a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160415-Imp.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160415-Imp_360.jpeg" /></a></div>

<p>Up first this week is the Imp, a diabolical little fellow who makes a perfect familiar for a villain or for the somewhat villainous arcane spellcaster that seems to infect nearly every party. Even though this figure is Tiny, I love all of the detail WizKids put into his face, and he's a nice addition to the ranks of devils that we'll continue to see in this set as we move toward its October release. The Imp is an uncommon figure.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160415-Eagle.jpg"><img src = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160415-Eagle_360.jpeg" /></a></div>

<p>Look, up in the sky, it's a freakin' terrifying raptor with claws as long as short swords! Here's hoping he's friendly! Giant Eagles have been a staple of fantasy since long before J.R.R. Tolkien had them rescue a bunch of hobbits from a tree, and I'm pleased to finally bring this "staple" creature to the <a href = "/pathfinderbattles">Pathfinder Battles</a> line. At the Large size and positioned in the uncommon rarity, it should be pretty easy to build up a terrifying flock!</p>

<p>And that's it for this week. I've got to space these things out a bit to make it all the way to October! In the meantime, keep on keepin' on, and keep up with the suggestions for new minis we can make for you!</p>

<p>Until then, I remain...</p>

<p>Spellcasters are the focus of legend and envy. Weapon masters are flashy and famous. Armor masters?<p>

<p>Armor masters are survivors.</p>

<p itemprop="description">The reason the best offense is a good defense is the undefended die, which tends to end any effort at offense. The life of adventurers, crusaders, and champions of any cause is filled with dangers and enemies. Hammers seek to crush heads, spears seek to pierce flesh. Unless you've mastered some esoteric fighting style likely to allow you to dodge crossbow bolts, or have the skill (and time) to defend yourself with spells, you need armor. And anything you depend on to save your life is worth learning to master.</p>

<p>So who are the armor masters of the Inner Sea?</p>

<p>The horse tribe nomads of Karazh have learned to balance the weight of their armor in the saddle, so it does not hamper their skilled riding.</p>

<p>The Knights of Arnisant follow in the footsteps of the famous general who was crucial to the defeat of the Whispering Tyrant. They depend on their shields to guard not just their bodies, but also their minds and souls against incorporeal undead, curse-flinging witches, and the death magic of necromancers.</p>

<p>The Kortos Cavalry are Absalom's only mounted troops, protecting the island's hinterlands as well as the Westgate district and training to fight to the last.</p>

<p>The yojimbos are samurai dedicated to protecting others, and their resolve is not focused on just their own needs. Each can act as a living shield, standing between a chosen ally and a deadly foe, but through force of will can also inspire an ally to overcome fatigue, or at higher levels allow and ally to stave off fear, nausea, and even death.</p>

<p>And anyone trusting armor from leather to plate can learn at least a few armored tricks to help themselves survive, whether it's combinging the power of your attacks with the weight of your armor with Intense Blow, expending stamina to more effectively use Redirect Attack, or just learning to fight from rafters and walls while wearing an arachnid harness.</p>

<div class="blurb360"><a href="/image/content/PathfinderAdventurePath/PZO1021-Cover.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderAdventurePath/PZO1021-Cover_360.jpeg"></a><br />
We welcome you, once again, to the city of old Korvosa.<br />

<p itemprop="description">All around the Paizo office the return of the sun and leaves and greenery are a reminder of upcoming trips and conventions (including <a href = "/paizocon">PaizoCon 2016</a>, May 27-30!) ahead this spring and summer. This time of the year is one that the Paizo staff, fans, and our community really look forward to&mdash;getting to meet many of you face-to-face, game together, and the announcements of Pathfinder products to come that we've been keeping under our hats!</p>

<p>In just a few short weeks, April products will be arriving at local game stores and the mailboxes of subscribers. These include:</p>

<ul><li><a href = "/products/btpy9jb9"><em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #105: The Inferno Gate</em> (Hell's Vengeance 3 of 6)</li>
<li><a href = "/products/btpy9fqi"><em>Pathfinder Adventure Card Game&mdash;Class Deck: Alchemist</em></a></li>
<li><a href = "/products/btpy9jbd"><em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Heaven Unleashed</em></a></li>
<li><a href = "/products/btpy9jbh"><em>Pathfinder Player Companion: Armor Master's Handbook</em></a></li>
<li><a href = "/products/btpy9jbp"><em>Pathfinder Flip-Mat Classics: River Crossing</em></a></li>
<li><a href = "/products/btpy9j6y"><em>Pathfinder Map Pack: Road System</em></a></li>
<li><a href = "/products/btpy9e45"><em>Pathfinder Tales: Hellknight</em></a></li>
<li><a href = "/products/btpy9k9y"><em>Pathfinder&mdash;Hollow Mountain #5</em></a></li>
<li><a href = "/products/btpy9gbv"><em>Pathfinder Legends&mdash;Mummy's Mask #5: The Slave Trenches of Hakotep</em></a></li></ul>

<p>Last month at GAMA Trade Show, Erik showed off <i>two</i> exciting developments to retailers and gaming industry professionals. The first is the introduction of a new Pocket Edition softcover format for the <a href = "/products/btpy9kfe"><em>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook</em></a> and <a href = "/products/btpy9kff"><em>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Bestiary</em></a> slated for release this July. These new softcover editions are a great option for newcomers to the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, or gamers who'd prefer a more travel friendly version of the rules.</p>

<p>The second announcement is one that's been highly speculated and sought after in our community&mdash;a return of the classic <a href = "/pathfinder/adventurePath/curseOfTheCrimsonThrone">Curse of the Crimson Throne Adventure Path</a> this September! The <a href = "/products/btpy9kg6"><em>Curse of the Crimson Throne</em> Hardcover</a> will update the Adventure Path to the Pathfinder RPG ruleset, include a new mission by James Jacobs, new illustrations, and more. Stay tuned for previews and peeks over the coming months on the Paizo blog!</p>

<p>We've also released the rest of our current product lineup for September 2016, so be sure to look out for:</p>

<ul><li><a href = "/products/btpy9l3g"><em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #110: The Thrushmoor Terror</em> (Strange Aeons 2 of 6)</a></li>
<li><a href = "/products/btpy9l3e"><em>Pathfinder Adventure Card Game&mdash;Class Deck: Warpriest</em></a></li>
<li><a href = "/products/btpy9l3f"><em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Inner Sea Temples</em></a></li>
<li><a href = "/products/btpy9l3h"><em>Pathfinder Player Companion: Divine Anthology</em></a></li>
<li><a href = "/products/btpy9l3d"><em>Pathfinder Pawns: Hell's Vengeance Pawn Collection</em></a></li>
<li><a href = "/products/btpy9l3i"><em>Pathfinder Flip-Mat: Mythos Dungeon</em></a></li></ul>

<p>Safe travels as you embark to gaming destinations near and far! If you're in the Seattle area next month, grab yourself a <a href = "/paizocon">PaizoCon Badge and Preview Banquet Ticket</a> (this nets you a first look at more Pathfinder goodness headed your way!), and celebrate all things Paizo and Pathfinder.</p>

<p>Greetings, Pathfinders!</p>

<p itemprop="description">How's everybody doing? Sitting down with your <a href = "/products/btpy9e8d">Barbarian</a>, <a href = "/products/btpy9ezo">Oracle</a>, and <a href = "/products/btpy9fqi">Alchemist Class Decks</a> and getting blown up by goblins in <a href = "/pfsacg/products/season2">Season of the Runelords</a>?

<h2>Pathfinder Society Pawn Pwnage</h2>
<p>I <i>squee</i>d briefly about this product last week, but I've got a little more space to expand on my happiness. Several months ago, Paizo Project Manager Jessica Price came to the Pathfinder Society team and said, "We've got a whole <a href = "/products/btpy9l30">Pathfinder Pawns product</a> just for PFS. What do you want to put in it?" After the cackling and rubbing of hands died down, John Compton, Mark Seifter, and Linda Zayas-Palmer started coming up with lists of characters. And lists, and lists, and lists. Then we rochambeau'd for who got to put in how many of their favorites. I won a lot, because I fight dirty. Mark's still a little afraid of me.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6803-Flenta.jpg"><img src = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6803-Flenta_180.jpeg"></a>
<a href = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6812-Grazzle.jpg"><img src = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6812-Grazzle_180.jpeg"></a>
<a href = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6812-RamexesCharacter.jpg"><img src = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6812-RamexesCharacter_120.jpeg"></a><br />
<i>Illustrations by Jorge Fares and Kent Hamilton.</i></div>

<p>All three of the promo goblin characters are in the set! Even Tup the Terrible, who hasn't even been released yet (<a href = "http://www.freerpgday.com" target = "_blank">Free RPG Day</a>, June 18th, at a game store near you)! All the non-iconic bards, clerics, fighter, rangers, rogues, sorcerers, wizards, monks, druids, paladins, barbarians, oracles, alchemists, inquisitors, witches, and gunslingers from their respective Class Decks are in this pawn collection. If I did my math right, that's 42 tokens for your Adventure Card Game characters! You can't beat the savings! (The iconics are in the <a href = "/products/btpy8x1f"><em>NPC Codex Box</em></a> and the <a href = "/products/btpy99sc"><em>Inner Sea Pawn Box</em></a>.)</p>

<h2>PaizoCon Event Preview</h2>
<p>Those of you attending <a href = "/paizocon">PaizoCon</a> this year are in for a treat. In addition to a special event in which I put you through the <del>woodchipper</del> ACG Open 2016, forum stalwarts and Venture-Officers cartmanbeck and Theryon Stormrune have teamed up to bring you a very unusual opportunity: a convention-exclusive custom version of the <em>We Be Goblins</em> trilogy. Theryon and I will be running special tables of cartmanbeck's new design during the afternoon slots, so keep your eyes peeled when the lottery goes live. (There will be a pouring-out of one for cartmanbeck, who isn't able to join us at the show this year.) Players will receive a one-off PFSACG reward whose potency depends on how long they live.</p>

<h2>New Recurring Thing: Art Preview!</h2>

<p>Now that we're sending the current batch of Class Decks to the printer, I am swimming in oceans of absolutely tremendous art that I can't wait to share with y'all. Each week, I'll give you a glimpse at one of my favorite pieces from an upcoming ACG product. This week, it's the Blessing of the Eternal Rose, from next month's <a href = "/products/btpy9gdq"><em>Inquisitor Class Deck</em></a>.</p>

<p>This past weekend I attended Emerald City Comic Con with over 80,000 other people! While not the largest convention I've participated in, it is in the top three (among Fan Expo Canada with 127,000 and Gen Con at 197,695 attendees). All three are huge conventions with a varied fan base!</p>

<p>Over the weekend, I managed a couple of breaks and visited other areas of the convention. While I didn't see any of the Pathfinder iconics running around, there was plenty of other great cosplay abound! Pockets of people formed as people took photos of some truly awesome concoctions of fabric, foam, and makeup. Seas of people filled the dealers hall and artist alley. Their talent amazes me and I could stand for hours looking at their work.</p>

<p>But Emerald City Comic Con is just one topic for this week. Let's shift gears to a topic that's been cropping up on the forums: the expense and difficulty of attending conventions. Some Pathfinders desire the rewards of attending conventions, namely boons, but couldn't see a way past the barriers blocking their path. On the organizational side, we receive requests for convention support from events that don't meet the requirements for venue or size. We don't like saying "no" to these events, so we put our heads together, and developed a "Game Day" program to augment our convention support program.</p>

<p>It took a few months to get the details hammered out on who qualifies, what they receive, and support distribution methods. We came up with a flexible program that allows us to tailor our response based on the region and needs of the community. The Game Day program supports three non-convention venues&mdash;the venue that is a consistently strong performer that needs recognition for its accomplishments, the venue that is new and could use support to establish itself, and those events that are not quite conventions because they occur in retail establishments or are just under the table requirements. All Game Days still must follow the requirement of being open to the public, registered on paizo.com, and having some form of online advertisement.</p>

<p>We decided the Regional Venture-Coordinators (RVC) know their areas best, so they should choose Game Days under the new program. Each RVC gets 10 such events a quarter. We chose 10 as a baseline number until we can see the reach of the program and identify the regional needs. The RVC works with the event organizer in establishing goals based off of attendance, event offerings, and community needs. Each Game Day should have a basic, stretch, and super stretch goal. Rewards in the form of player and GM boons scale with the goals, with all Game Days getting the basic Tier 3 rewards. If a Game Day meets its stretch goals, then they earn Tier 2 rewards, just as super stretch equals Tier 1.</p>

<p>It is my pleasure to introduce the first of our game days. For the second quarter of 2016, the Southeastern region named Cool Kids Excelsior 2nd Anniversary Bash from April 29-May 1 in Hoover, Alabama, as one of their not-quite-a-con Game Days, as it is held in a retail location. Point of contact is Venture-Captain Mike Seales. The second Southeastern Game Day is TriCon from April 23-24, 2016, in High Point, North Carolina. Once again, it is an event in a retail location. Venture-Lieutenant Landon Hatfield is leading this event. Both of these Game Days are on the event locator here on the website; if you want more details check them out! The Western-Europe/Middle East region named one Game Day: Madrid, Spain, is hosting reoccurring game day. The first was April 2-3 and saw 10 tables of <i>Siege of Serpents</i> and a few other games. The next occurrence is April 30, when they plan to run introduction events in four different locations across Madrid. For more information, contact Venture-Captain Tesifonte Negro Gonzalez. Venture-Officer emails are on the <a href = "/regionalCoordinators">Regional Coordinators page</a>. I look forward to announcing more Game Days as the program grows!</p>

<p>Finally, I would like to apologize to the three individuals who entered the Pathfinder Adventure Card Guild accessory contest. I didn't take my travel schedule into account when I set the submission deadline, and was out of the office when the deadline occurred. But, late is better than never! We had three submissions of three unique accessories. Voting opens today and closes it on Friday, April 15th. Winners will be announced in the blog on Monday, April 18th! Please take a moment and vote for your favorite!</p>

<p itemprop="description">The <a href = "/pathfinder/adventurePath/hellsVengeance">Hell's Vengeance Adventure Path</a> is here, and it's time to reveal the next iconic villain for Paizo's first Adventure Path for evil characters!

<div class="blurb360"><a href="/image/content/PathfinderAdventurePath/PZO90107-Urgraz.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderAdventurePath/PZO90107-Urgraz_360.jpeg"></a><br /><i>Illustration by Wayne Reynolds</i></div>

<p>Urgraz was born into a life that had everything a duergar could hope for&mdash;which isn't much. He was trained and tested throughout his harsh childhood, as are all duergar, and showed aptitude for both military duties and the mental rigors of the priesthood. But Urgraz hated the inflexible order of training and railed against the rule of ministers of Droskar, the god of his people.</p>

<p>Before long, Urgraz began instigating minor rebellions and sought to cause accidents for his fellow trainees. More than once, the young duergar was caught bending the rules for no other reason than to cause havoc and injure other trainees (which delighted him in ways that no other activity could). Some level of deception and treachery is expected among the faithful of Droskar, but such duplicity is expected to be in service of a plan to bring greater wealth or power. Urgraz quickly discovered that claiming to have a plan, no matter how complex or unlikely, to gain from the confusion he caused appeased his masters. As a result, they marked him not as rebellious, but simply shortsighted and slow-minded.</p>

<p>The elders of Urgraz's clan relegated the apparently unpromising duergar to guard duty on slave caravans to distant drow cities. Urgraz caused minor difficulties however he could, and amused himself by killing the occasional straggling slave in painful ways. When that grew dull, he began to trick and kill fellow duergar in accidents he staged. Thanks to his gifted talent for lying and his reputation of being dull-witted, Urgraz found such crimes easy to commit, and he soon grew bored once again.</p>

<p>Years passed, and the restless duergar struggled to find new ways to satisfy his urge to create chaos and pain. Urgraz acquired an oversized crossbow from an especially well-equipped cave giant that he could only fire by putting it down and then using his innate enlarge person ability, just because he liked the sight of impaled foes. He sold diseased slaves to spread plague, sabotaged the gear of fellow duergar, and even killed members of his own family by contaminating their food with virulent disease-laden ingredients. Such indirect efforts gave him a slight thrill, but could not sustain Urgraz's need for anarchy.</p>

<p>Through his family's slave trade with the drow, Urgraz struck up an acquaintance with a dark elf named Zaykira. Though the two were not friends, and certainly did not trust each other, Zaykira and Urgraz discovered they shared a mutual desire for destruction. Zaykira worshiped the demon lord Mazmezz, and showed Urgraz the power a demon lord could grant those willing to offer acceptable forms of obedience and sacrifice. Zaykira suggested the two form a team and pose as outcasts working as guides for surface dwellers exploring the Darklands. At an opportune moment, when they had lulled their employers into a false sense of safety, the two would turn on their charges and sacrifice them to the greater glory of Mazmezz, who would reward them both.</p>

<p>Urgraz agreed, and the two moved to the uppermost regions of Nar-Voth, where they began a modest business as guides and, as Zaykira had suggested, killed those who hired them. Urgraz discovered that anticipation of vile acts felt almost as satisfying as the acts themselves, and that if he feigned loyalty and friendship he could arrange far more complex and satisfying situations for his victims than any single act of torture or abuse. He learned  discipline and patience, all in the name of achieving greater horror.</p>

<p>Zaykira continued to pressure Urgraz to swear himself to Mazmezz, and eventually Urgraz relented. They captured a dwarf to sacrifice to the demon lord, and shared a meal before the sacrifice… and that's when Zaykira suddenly became paralyzed. Urgraz explained to his partner that he had poisoned the food, and was himself immune to its effects. Before killing the closest thing to an ally he had ever had, Urgraz made sure Zaykira knew this day had long been coming. He had planned for it since they had first joined forces. He had just waited until Zaykira was far from home, support, and rescue, and lulled into a false sense of safety. It was Urgraz's greatest betrayal, and he expected to revel in it for years.</p>

<p>Urgraz took his time sacrificing Zaykira to Mazmezz, using everything he had learned from their study together. As he finished, a sense of dark power began burning inside him. He realized that not only did he wish to cause catastrophes and death and spread anarchy and evil, but he specifically wanted to hurt those who stood for better things. While he might desire nothing more than to rampage through the Darklands and destroy the entire duergar race, Urgraz knew he needed time to grow stronger. Until that time, he would remain on the surface, training himself for his eventual task.</p>

<p>When Urgraz found the world above, thankfully bathed only in moonlight, he followed a road that led toward Canorate, capital city of the nation of Molthune. The guards at the city gates demanded to know his business there.</p>

<p>"I am Urgraz, an outcast from Nar-Voth. I had to flee the realms below, for I did not fit the strictures of my people's society, and would have been killed if I had stayed. I am an able warrior, and seek employment."</p>

<p>Every word was technically true. For now, Urgraz would serve an employer. He would be patient.</p>

<p>He had learned the satisfaction of a betrayal years in the making, and eagerly awaited the misery and chaos he could cause in the surface lands.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for the reveal of our sixth and final iconic villain appearing in the pages of our first evil Adventure Path, Hell's Vengeance!</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline">Behind the Book—Hellknight</h1>
<p class="date">Wednesday, April 6, 2016</p>

<div itemprop="articleBody">

<div style = "float: left; padding: 0 10px 10px 0;"><a href = "/products/btpy9e45"><img src = "//static4.paizo.com/image/product/catalog/PZO/PZO8532_180.jpeg"></a></div>

<p itemprop="description">Later this month the new Pathfinder Tales novel, <a href = "/products/btpy9e45"><em>Hellknight</em></a> by Liane Merciel releases! So, I wanted to drop in and tell you all why this book might just be your new favorite in the line.</p>

<p>If you've been following the novels for a while (and if you aren't, you can <a href = "/products/btpy8dea">subscribe right here</a> and stop missing out), you probably know Liane best from <a href = "/products/btpy8sa9"><em>Nightglass</em></a> and <a href = "/products/btpy99k6"><em>Nightblade</em></a>. Through the adventures of Isiem and his companions, Liane did more than anyone to establish the dark yet terrifyingly realistic flavor of Nidal's society, as well as much of our understanding of the winged strix. I make no secret of my admiration for the work she's done fleshing out that part of our world, so when she proposed turning her attention to Cheliax and the Hellknights, I knew that I could trust her to bring some of the most important pieces of our campaign setting to life.</p>

<p>And did she ever! See, without realizing it, Liane had been training for this book for years. She had spent countless sessions playing through the <a href = "/pathfinder/adventurePath/councilOfThieves">Council of Thieves Adventure Path</a>, steeping in the lore of Westcrown and the surrounding region until she was an even greater expert than those of us who created it. She's meticulous with the canon, and running across all the tiny cameos and easter eggs in this novel made the setting feel <i>alive</i> in the way only the best tie-in books do.</p>

<div class="blurb180"><a href="/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8532-Jheraal.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8532-Jheraal_180.jpeg"></a><br /><i>Illustration by Roberto Pitturru</i></div>

<p>Yet the best example of that skill comes in the main characters themselves. You've got Ederras, a Chelish paladin of Iomedae struggling to reconcile his calling with his rightful place in Cheliax's aristocracy. You've got Velenne, a spellcasting scion of House Thrune who can scheme with the best of them. And you've got Jheraal&mdash;illustrated here by Eric Belisle&mdash;a tiefling Hellknight specialized in solving crimes whose devotion to her order is trumped only by her dedication to the secret daughter she gave up for adoption. While far from perfect, these people are all heroes, and together they show better than I've ever seen how Chelish society can emerge from the actions of fundamentally ordinary people. Velenne in particular fascinates me, because she exemplifies how someone can be part of an evil organization like House Thrune and still be human, relatable&mdash;even <i>likeable</i>. A person with hopes and dreams and loves... and profane compacts with Hell.</p>

<p>It's a tribute to Liane's work that even Erik Mona, who created Cheliax and House Thrune, came away from the novel saying he felt like he understood that part of our setting much better now. So if you're playing in a Cheliax-based adventure path&mdash;such as, say, Hell's Rebels or Hell's Vengeance&mdash;there's really no better primer for the flavor of those campaigns than <a href = "/products/btpy9e45"><em>Hellknight</em></a>.</p>

<p>So there you go! A paean to the ambiguities of society and the human condition, and&mdash;</p>

<p>Wait, what's that? You want to know what the book's actually <i>about</i>?</p>

<p>Oh, well, there's somebody hideously murdering tieflings in Westcrown and stealing their still-beating hearts. And shadow monsters. And graveknights. And an exploration of the Hellknights' greatest shame, one so sinister that an entire order was destroyed to keep it quiet. Sound good? Yeah, I thought so too.</p>

<p>Anyway, please give the book a read, then come back to the forums to let me and Liane know what you think&mdash;we'd love to hear from you!</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline">Alchemist Class Deck Preview</h1>

<p class="date">Tuesday, April 5, 2016</p>

<div itemprop="articlebody">

<p>First, I would like to emit a gentle squeeing noise, then inform you that many Class Deck characters are soon to exist as <a href = "/products/btpy9l30">Pathfinder Pawns</a>! (If you're looking for pawns for the iconics, you'll find the Rise of the Runelords iconics in the <a href = "/products/btpy8x1f"><em>NPC Codex Box</em></a> and the ones from Skull & Shackles and Wrath of the Righteous in the <a href = "/products/btpy99sc"><em>Inner Sea Pawn Box</em></a>, which also includes pawns for many of the characters in the upcoming Goblin decks!)</p>

<p itemprop="description">Since we've already had someone make the case for Damiel as the <a href = "/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lhjt">best character ever</a>, we're skipping right to the <a href = "/products/btpy9fqi"><em>Alchemist Class Deck</em></a> preview this week. This deck is the brainchild of Lone Shark designers Liz Spain and Paul Peterson (and if you know them, you are now probably a little afraid and a lot excited). Let's get to it.</p>

<h2>Damiel 2: Alchemical Boogaloo</h2>
<p>Everyone's favorite potion-maker made his Pathfinder Adventure Card Game debut in the <a href = "/products/btpy92zj"><em>Skull & Shackles Base Set</em></a>, wherein he flexed his Craft skill and threw as many Noxious Bombs as he could get his hands on. He was also fond of that set's Fire Lance, a tasty little firearm that featured the Alchemical trait. We've brought back the Fire Lance, and given it a big brother.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6011-DamielFront.jpg"><img src = "//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6011-DamielFront_360.jpeg"></a>
<a href = "//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6813-DamielCharacterFront.jpg"><img src = "//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6813-DamielCharacterFront_360.jpeg"></a>
<a href = "//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6813-FlameCannon.jpg"><img src = "//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6813-FlameCannon_180.jpeg"></a><br />
<i>There was supposed to be an earth-shattering KABOOM!</i></div>

<p>As you can see, this Damiel's skipped the Craft checks for alchemical goodies and spell work and gone straight to automatic recharge, Valeros-style. He can also throw alchemy bombs as kickers to his Ranged attacks. Roles for this new Damiel are called Miscibility Master (because we respect the classics) and Mindchemist (because Liz is just a little insane).</p>

<h2>The New Class: Cogsnap and Mother Myrtle</h2>
<p>The other two characters in this deck are the definitely unstable Cogsnap and the grounded, nurturing Mother Myrtle. Cogsnap has some of my favorite character art in the whole game; you can tell just by looking at him what sort of character he is. He blows up monsters then harvests them for parts. My favorite role for this fellow is the Bloodbomber, whose flavor text reads, "To bloodbombers, all liquids can be turned into explosives, including what remains after the explosion." <i>[Mike: My work here is done.]</i> Maniacal cackling is basically a requirement if you want to play Cogsnap.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6813-Cogsnap.jpg"><img src = "//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6813-Cogsnap_360.jpeg"></a>
<a href = "//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6813-CogsnapFront.jpg"><img src = "//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6813-CogsnapFront_180.jpeg"></a>
<a href = "//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6813-CogsnapBack.jpg"><img src = "//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6813-CogsnapBack_180.jpeg"></a><br />
<i>Heheheheheheheheheh... boom.</i></div>

<p>Mother Myrtle, by contrast, is a sweet old lady. A jaunty sprig of holly rides atop her hat. She carries bundles of grain and a bowl of something nourishing. I'm sure she only uses that scythe to harvest herbs. And her roles are Preservationist and... Reanimator?</p>

<div class="blurbCenter"><a href="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6813-MotherMyrtle.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6813-MotherMyrtle_360.jpeg"></a>
<a href = "//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6813-MotherMyrtleFront.jpg"><img src = "//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6813-MotherMyrtleFront_180.jpeg"></a>
<a href = "//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6813-MotherMyrtleBack.jpg"><img src = "//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6813-MotherMyrtleBack_180.jpeg"></a><br />
<i>I bet the witch in Hansel and Gretel looked friendly too.</i></div>

<p>Myrtle is a spellcaster who's very thrifty. She likes to keep things cycling, and she knows a little about a lot. I find her to be a very well-rounded character to play; I hope you like her.</p>

<h2>Where's the Candy?</h2>
<p>To close, I thought I'd share with you some of the cool new boons we've put in this deck, including some sneak previews of a whole bunch of Mummy's Mask cards that we just couldn't wait to put into print. This deck is all about the Alchemical trait and elemental damage types, so I've got a shield that's useful if you accidentally blow yourself up, some silver-tongue elixir, and possibly my favorite ally art yet.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6813-AlchemistShield.jpg"><img src = "//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6813-AlchemistShield_180.jpeg"></a>
<a href = "//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6813-LiquidPersuasion.jpg"><img src = "//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6813-LiquidPersuasion_180.jpeg"></a>
<a href = "//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6813-FlensingJelly.jpg"><img src = "//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6813-FlensingJelly_180.jpeg"></a><br />
<i>You can't go wrong with a little flensing jelly. Put it on your toast, grease up a door hinge, or strip the skin off your most recent kill. It does everything!</i></div>

<p>The <a href = "/products/btpy9fqi"><em>Alchemist Class Deck</em></a> is in stores April 27, and available for preorder now.</p>

<p>Until next time, Pathfinders!</p>

<div itemprop="articlebody">

<p itemprop="description">Almost thirteen years have passed since my last trip to Las Vegas, and those memories focus on spending time at the Excalibur, playing the carnival games with my husband and son. March saw my return to the City of Lights. This time, I traveled the north Strip, with my days full of retailer presentations and working the Paizo booth at the GAMA Trade Show.

The trip ended all too soon, but I wasn't filled with post-convention blues, as I traveled on to Florida for some vacation time with my family. I enjoyed myself and recharged my batteries in preparation for convention season.</p>

<p>Now that I'm back in the Paizo offices I'm busy at work on a myriad of tasks. The biggest ones involves pulling the edges together on Pathfinder Society projects for the upcoming convention season. John, Linda, Tanis, and I are spending quite a bit of time focused on PFS activities for the next few months. That and planning out the new Roleplaying Guild season and some new programs for ACG take up a lot of our time. If you want a sneak peak of our efforts, check out John and I on the Know Direction podcast this Wednesday, April 6th, at 5:30 Pacific.</p>

<p>While I've organized many conventions over my three years as Venture-Officer, now I'm learning how to juggle multiple shows at one time. At this time, the PaizoCon volunteer roster is complete, with the exception of cancellations. Speaking of cancellations, several Gen Con volunteer spaces opened up. I will be reviewing the signups and contacting peoples this week. I thank everyone for their patience as I work through the herculean task of setting up our biggest conventions. Ya think you know what goes on behind the scenes until you get there and find out you only saw the tip of the iceberg.</p>

<p>Speaking of travel and conventions. My schedule for the next few months includes attendance at:</p>

<ul><li>Emerald City Comic Con&mdash;April 8-10</li>
<li>Quad Cities Gaming Convention&mdash;April 30-May 1</li>
<li>PaizoCon&mdash;May 27-30</li>
<li>Origins&mdash;June 15-19</li>
<li>PaizoCon UK&mdash;July 22-24</li>
<li>Gen Con&mdash;August 4-7</li>
<li>PAX&mdash;September 2-5</li></ul>

<p>But conventions are just one part of the job. Another large component involves volunteer oversight. My inbox overfloweth with new applications. Awesome news, so many volunteers expressing eagerness at organizing PFS activities. One of my goals for this week: activate status on all received applications. Will check in next Monday on reaching my goal.</p>

<p>Speaking (writing?) of volunteers. Over the past month, two GMs earned their five-star status. Jim Hazel and Landon Hatfield both ran their 150th game in March. We also identified a GM, Josh McIllwain, who qualified for his fifth star in July, but hadn't been announced. Please take a moment to congratulate our excellent GMs who achieved this recognition.</p>

<p>Some parting thoughts as we head into convention season: As a game system, Pathfinder embraces everyone, and so too does the Pathfinder Society. As you travel to conventions or meet up at your local game store, remember to treat each other with respect and understanding. We are a friendly and welcoming community of gamers&mdash;if you feel that another person at the table or event is acting against the spirit of the campaign, please contact your local Venture-Officer, who will bring it up the chain to where it can be resolved. Conversely, my door is always open!</p>

<p>Explore, Report, Cooperate!</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline">Two for the Road</h1>
<p class="date">Friday, April 1, 2016</p>

<div itemprop="articlebody">

<p itemprop="description">I'm leaving for a much-needed vacation to the ruined ancient cities of Mexico in about an hour, so I'm going to make this week's Pathfinder Battles preview short and sweet. The sun is shining, I've got packing to do, and this is no time to be at work.</p>

<p>That said, I'm absolutely thrilled with the quality of sculpts WizKids has been sending us for October's <a href = "/products/btpy9kcu"><em>Deadly Foes</em></a> set of prepainted plastic gaming figures. This latest pair&mdash;a diabolical pair if I've ever seen one&mdash;bring dark flames to my wicked heart.</p>

<div class="blurbCenter"><a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160401-PriestOfAsmodeus.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160401-PriestOfAsmodeus_360.jpeg" /></a></div>

<p>Two maces. A wicked beard. A giant upside down pentagram to properly honor Lord Asmodeus. What's not to love? The Priest of Asmodeus makes a great rank-and-file evil cleric, but he's dynamic enough to be a specific, credible villain. The figure is a Medium piece slated at the common rarity.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160401-ThruneEnforcer.jpg"><img src = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160401-ThruneEnforcer_360.jpeg" /></a></div>

<p>This cool Thrune Enforcer is the perfect compliment to the Priest of Asmodeus, a great shock-trooper for an evil army or even a member of an evil town's city watch. Heck, if you look past the glyph of the evil empire Cheliax, she'd even work well for a darkly garbed, mace-wielding player character. Either way, you don't want to see her coming at you with that mace held high after you unexpectedly interrupt a candle-lit ceremony! The Thrune Enforcer is a Medium, common figure.</p>

<p>And with that, I say "GRACIAS" for your interest in and support of the <a href = "/pathfinderbattles">Pathfinder Battles</a> line. I'm off work next week, which means no figure preview next Friday. I WILL return in two weeks time with even more cool minis to show off, however, provided I don't take a nasty tumble down a Mayan pyramid.</p>

<p>Until then, I remain...</p>
