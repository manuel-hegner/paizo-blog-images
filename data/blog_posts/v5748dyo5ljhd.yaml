  \     </div> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">It's been about a week since I returned\
  \ from my sixth <a href=\"http://s-c-a-r-a-b.com\" target=\"_blank\">SCARAB</a>,\
  \ a delightful 4-day gaming convention in Columbia, South Carolina that I've been\
  \ attending since before I started working at Paizo—and it's now one of the biggest\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety\">Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild</a> events\
  \ worldwide. Each year it's been a great experience, and this year was no exception.\
  \ I've definitely returned with some fun stories. I'll fondly remember the high-level\
  \ group of adventurers who navigated a dungeon almost entirely by repeatedly casting\
  \ augury, and the high-level group that nearly decided to throw both major NPCs\
  \ under a bus and declare themselves queens of a small village makes for a thrilling\
  \ tale. I can't forget the giantslayers who neither understood giant nor could identify\
  \ a peryton, referring to instead as a \"deer-headed marmot-squeezer.\" Perhaps\
  \ best of all was getting through an entire scenario without rolling initiative\
  \ because we decided that throwing a immense rival party on another plane of existence\
  \ was a much more fun alternative to raiding someone's home. Thank you Del Collins\
  \ II, Matt Polkowsky, and the SCARAB crew for putting on a great event, and thanks\
  \ to David Shaw, Amanda Plageman, Brent Gass, Matt Beebe, Leslie Foster, Chris First,\
  \ and many others for some great games.</p> \n     <p>Speaking of great games, the\
  \ team has two more fun adventures debuting this week. The first is the conclusion\
  \ of the 3-part series Tyranny of Winds, which has taken the PCs from the elemental\
  \ wastelands of eastern Osirion to the stunning djinn capital of Armun Kelisk on\
  \ the Plane of Air. In <a href=\"/products/btpy9p8z?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-812-Tyranny-of-Winds-Part-3-Caught-in-the-Eclipse\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-12: Tyranny of Winds, Part 2: Caught in the\
  \ Eclipse</em></a>, a Tier 3-7 adventure by Jason Evans, the Society has learned\
  \ of an immensely powerful enemy, and the Pathfinders' one-time foes have become\
  \ allies of convenience to ensure their mutual survival. If the Society's to stand\
  \ a chance, it needs to secure one of the few weapons that this new threat fears:\
  \ the Horn of the Hurricane, which is trapped within the lawless harbor Port Eclipse.\
  \ Not only is this a hotbed of enemy activity, but the Pathfinders' best contact\
  \ for how to reach the weapon has disappeared there. Plan for subtlety but brace\
  \ for a climatic finish with this exciting finale with ties to the Grand Lodge faction!</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The Pathfinder Society's been busy on other elemental planes, too. Having\
  \ recently concluded <a href=\"/products/btpy9p8w?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-809-Forged-in-Flame-Part-1-The-Cindersworn-Pact\"\
  >a dangerous deal on the Plane of Fire</a>, the Decemvirate now knows of a powerful\
  \ tool lost within the Kullan Dei mountains (something we first hinted at in <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy9mbb?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-802-Ward-Asunder\"><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Society Scenario #8-02: Ward Asunder</em></a>). However, retrieving this doesn't\
  \ just mean succeeding where a famed local hero could not; it also requires braving\
  \ the icy mountains that still rumble with roiling magma. Tier 7-11 scenarios like\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9qc8?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-813-What-Sleeps-in-Stone\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-13: What Sleeps in Stone</em></a> are so often\
  \ a great opportunity to present adventures in extreme locations, and there's little\
  \ more exciting than going into an active volcano. It gets even better when the\
  \ volcano isn't just capable of swallowing the PCs—it's alive! Larry Wilhelm brings\
  \ you a thrilling story, but if you want to survive, watch your step!</p> \n   \
