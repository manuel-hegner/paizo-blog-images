  >As the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/ruinsOfAzlant\">Ruins of Azlant</a>\
  \ sink below the waves, a new age dawns across the Inner Sea. Discord is coming\
  \ to Taldor. More accurately: the discord that has simmered quietly just beneath\
  \ the staid surface of Taldor is ready to boil over, and consume the remnants of\
  \ the once-great empire. Taldor's end is in sight, and has been for a thousand years.\
  \ The end may be a generation away, or a century, or an age, but always it closes.\
  \ The nations passengers know they plod steadily toward to edge of the world, and\
  \ yet the captains at the wheel refuse to see, refuse to change the course. Most\
  \ Adventure Paths aim to save the world from a new and immediate threat to emerge\
  \ on the scene, but the villain threatening to destroy Taldor is entropy and tradition.\
  \ And victory means changing how a whole nation thinks. Victory means winning the\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/warForTheCrown\">War for the Crown</a>.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>War for the Crown began two years ago, as an idea I pitched as part of\
  \ the meetings that eventually led to <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/ironfangInvasion\"\
  >Ironfang Invasion Adventure Path</a>. I wanted players to feel like they had some\
  \ real stake in the future of the Inner Sea region, but the worry at the time was\
  \ that my first AP should be something more traditional while I learned the ropes.\
  \ I put my notes in a drawer and a year later I brought them back out, and this\
  \ time I dug my feet in. This time I wanted to tackle one of my first loves of the\
  \ Inner Sea: Taldor! And I wanted the PCs to help flesh out this maligned and oversimplified\
  \ nation—seen as little more than laughable aristocracy stereotypes—into a complex\
  \ nation on par with Andoran and Cheliax. I wanted Taldor to have a future and I\
  \ wanted the PCs to help guide it there.</p> \n    <p>And that's what we got.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The final War for the Crown evolved a lot from those first notes. In\
  \ my first draft, the PCs chose one of three inheritors to back, and the adventure\
  \ text itself would abstract the adventure a little more, referring to the major\
  \ NPCs as the Patron, the Ally, and the Adversary. As much as I loved this idea,\
  \ the problem is that it means about 1/3 of each volume would be useless to any\
  \ given group (and no I couldn't make the books any longer; I asked). It also caused\
  \ problems in not being able to flesh out specific NPCs very well, since any given\
  \ NPC would need to serve one of three masters. Eventually we started asking which\
  \ of the three candidates would be the \"canon\" inheritor of the Primogen Crown,\
  \ and opted to focus the entire AP around working for them.</p> \n    <p>That \"\
  canon\" inheritor, who now ends up your patron, was Princess Eutropia. Not exactly\
  \ shocking, given that we've teased her revolutionary leanings and political goals\
  \ since the original <em>Pathfinder Chronicles: Campaign Setting</em> back in 2008.\
  \ The lady's worked hard and wants try steering Taldor away from its 600-year status\
  \ quo of slow ruin, and there are more than a few traditionalists who think she\
  \ hasn't earned it, or that she has sinister motives, or just that a woman needs\
  \ to know her place. Grand princess Eutropia going into the second decade of Golarion's\
  \ existence doesn't just move the timeline forward, it means Taldor becomes a nation\
  \ of tradition vs. progress and old vs. new, a nation of backroom political intrigue\
  \ where fortunes and family fates hang in the balance. Not just a stagnant world\
  \ of laughable, foppish nobles.</p> \n    <p>And if your group doesn't particularly\
  \ want to back Eutropia for the throne? If they want to select their own candidate\
  \ or make their own grab for power? The core plot of War for the Crown is (hopefully)\
  \ designed to still be flexible enough that a GM can adapt to a different inheritor\
  \ taking center stage for their campaign. The foreword for <em>#127: Crownfall</em>\
  \ has a few notes and suggestions for adapting the campaign to your own table.</p>\
  \ \n    <h2>Interchangeable Pieces</h2> \n    <p>One of the big goals for War for\
  \ the Crown was a campaign with a lot of fun player options for tables to use or\
  \ ignore depending on their own preferences. Several adventures use the various\
  \ social combat and influence rules from Pathfinder: Ultimate Intrigue, but GMs\
  \ should feel free takes the NPC personality notes and goals and let their tables\
  \ simply play out dramatic scenes. Volume 2 introduces two special subsystems to\
  \ capture two different aspects of Taldor: The Cults of Personality—so PCs can feel\
  \ like movers and shakers all on their own—and the Relics system—which introduces\
  \ magic items that grow stronger as their wielder accomplished great things on behalf\
  \ of their people. Social, scheming tables will find the first system a delightful\
  \ little distraction between game sessions, directing their psychophants and hangers-on\
  \ to spy, spread word of their awesomeness, or rob the public blind. More combat-oriented\
  \ tables will love the second, as your favorite sword or armor or ring grows cooler\
  \ and more powerful just like your character does. Neither is central to the AP\
  \ plot. Both suit the mood.</p> \n    <h2>Humanity and NPCs</h2> \n    <p>One of\
  \ the challenges in a campaign built around intrigue and politics is finding motivation\
  \ and personality for everyone involved, as almost anyone can serve as a friend,\
  \ an ally of convenience, or an enemy, depending on a given table. Everyone needs\
  \ a little personality and motivation, because hey, who isn't above a bribe? I had\
  \ wanted to get rid of alignment altogether, because the nine-alignment system seemed\
  \ overly simplistic for the complex moralities that lie at the heart of good political\
  \ dramas, but apparently the alignments are \"traditional\" and \"integral to several\
  \ spells, class features, and monsters.\"</p> \n    <p>I tried guys.</p> \n    <p>Instead\
  \ I've opted for showcasing little bits of NPC motivations and personality. Maxillar\
  \ Pythareus might be a distant asshole who thinks women should be at home bearing\
  \ kids, but his face brightens up if you want to talk war history and miniature\
  \ wargames. Kalbio of Breezy Creek might be kind of an annoying hick, but dammit\
  \ if he isn't just SO INVESTED in everything, because Oppara is SO BIG you guys.\
  \ And Eutropia, the sophisticated dilettante, the respectable princess-come-social\
  \ reformer? She is exactly the kind of nerd who would name her dog a pun.</p> \n\
  \    <p>As part of humanizing the characters, the running theme for this AP's foreword\
  \ illustrations is showing where they came from: A major NPC's childhood illustrated,\
  \ largely without comment, in each volume. Here are the first three.</p> \n    <div\

  \ \n    <p>War for the Crown is an Adventure Path with very human opponents and\
  \ very human consequences. Failure doesn't mean the apocalypse, just a continuation\
  \ of Taldor's current course and slow decline. Someone may change things in the\
  \ future, but those who suffer in the current system won't stop suffering until\
  \ someone changes Taldor's course.</p> \n    <p>War for the Crown kicks off in just\
  \ a couple weeks with <a href=\"/products/btpy9u09?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-127-Crownfall\"\
  >Pathfinder Adventure Path #127: Crownfall</a>, and you can still preorder or subscribe\
  \ now!</p> \n    <p>And I'm going to close out this blog with the motivational poster\
  \ that's been watching over my desk since I started the earliest outlining stages\
  \ of War for the Crown, guiding and encouraging me along the way. If you ever think\
