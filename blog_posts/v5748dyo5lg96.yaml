  \ A. Stackpole (New York Times best-selling author of <i>X-Wing: Rogue Squadron</i>)\
  \ brings you a new novel of frontier adventure that offers a taste of the setting\
  \ featured in the new <a href=\"http://goblinworks.com\" target=\"_blank\">Pathfinder\
  \ Online</a> massively multiplayer online roleplaying game. When the aristocratic\
  \ Vishov family has been banished from Ustalav due to underhanded politics, Lady\

  \ for the nearby River Kingdoms and establish a new holding on the untamed frontier.\
  \ Together with her children and loyal retainers, she’ll forge a new life in the\
  \ infamous Echo Wood, and neither bloodthirsty monsters nor local despots will stop\

  >A Dream Uprooted</h2> \n     <p>Jerrad couldn't tell from which direction the scream\
  \ had come. He'd been huddled beneath a blanket reading the wizardry text. Something\
  \ about the words didn't require light for him to read—which made sense. Many of\
  \ the spells were centered around illusions and projecting images into a subject's\
  \ mind. The whole book, he decided, was primarily a practical text on illusion,\
  \ and he devoured each lesson as the book choose to reveal it to him.</p> \n   \
  \  <p><i>Don</i>'<i>t move</i>. He closed the book and trembled. <i>Someone just\
  \ had an accident. It can</i>'<i>t be anything bad. Just stay here.</i></p> \n \
  \    <p>Someone else screamed. </p> \n     <p><i>Serra!</i></p> \n     <p>He threw\
  \ off the blanket. Silhouettes ran through the night—some normal people and some\
  \ small, like children, but with enormous heads and ridiculously large ears. He\
  \ resisted the urge to duck beneath the blankets again, and instead cupped his hands\
  \ around his mouth. \"Goblins!\"</p> \n     <p>Jerrad grabbed his belt and fumbled\
  \ with the buckle for a heartbeat or two before realizing he didn't need to wear\
  \ the belt. His hand drifted down to the dagger, and he drew it just in time for\
  \ one of the goblins to bound into his tent, peg teeth flashing.</p> \n     <p>Time\
  \ died. The goblin had daubed its face with reddish mud and some yellow paste probably\
  \ made from flowers. It had tied feathers to its biceps and just below the knees.\
  \ A mangy skin made up its loincloth and the short cloak it wore. It had a rusty\
  \ knife tucked into a slender belt, but never made to draw it.</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ goblin hissed and leaped for him. Clawed hands reached for Jerrad's throat. The\
  \ young man thrust the dagger forward—less as an attack than an attempt to fend\
  \ the goblin off. His dagger plunged into the goblin's throat right above a necklace\
  \ of bones. Hot blood shot up Jerrad's sleeve, and the goblin's dying spin tore\
  \ the slicked knife from his hand. The creature stumbled and fell against Jerrad's\
  \ cot.</p> \n     <p>The goblin's claws rent the pillow asunder, then the creature\
  \ slumped amid a blizzard of feathers. It sighed as if settling down for a welcome\
  \ nap.</p> \n     <p>Jerrad stared at his gore-drenched hand. A feather landed on\
  \ it, drinking in the goblin's blood. <i>What have I done?</i></p> \n     <p>Then\
  \ he heard another scream. <i>Serra! I have to find Serra!</i> He dropped to a knee\
  \ and yanked the dagger from the goblin's throat. Trailing feathers in his wake,\
  \ he ran into the night, and heard her scream a third time.</p> \n     <p><i>There!</i></p>\
  \ \n     <p>Serrana ran pell-mell through the camp in a panic. She headed mostly\
  \ west, angling toward the furthest of the root cellars. He raced after her, slashing\
  \ goblins and pushing them out of the way. He didn't hurt many, but caught a couple\
  \ solidly. They'd either not seen him coming or didn't care as long as there was\
  \ loot to carry off. Odd, capering victory dances took precedence over fighting,\
  \ adding absurdity to the night's horrific chaos.</p> \n     <p>Ahead, his sister\
  \ tripped and fell against a pile of wood scraps. Three goblins moved at her. Two\
  \ had knives.</p> \n     <p>\"Hey!\" Jerrad thrust his left hand high in the air\
  \ as the goblins stared at him. <i>This better work!</i></p> \n     <p>He cast the\
  \ spell he'd been trying to perfect beneath the blanket. A brilliant light flared\
  \ from his hand, rendering the goblins in silver and his sister in icy blue. One\
  \ goblin screamed, dropping his knife, and clawed at his own eyes.</p> \n     <p>As\
  \ darkness returned and a wave of fatigue washed over him, Jerrad let his run carry\
  \ him into the nearest goblin. He bowled the creature over. His foe sank teeth into\
  \ Jerrad's left shoulder, but the boy barely noticed. Hand tight on the dagger's\
  \ sticky hilt, Jerrad stabbed again and again. His thrusts ruined the goblin's belly,\
  \ but he didn't stop stabbing until the jaws slackened.</p> \n     <p>He pitched\
  \ the body off and rose, blood coursing down his arm and dripping from the blade.\
  \ He gave Serra a smile. \"It's okay.\"</p> \n     <p>Her eyes grew wide and her\
  \ voice rose with fear. \"Jerrad, look out!\"</p> \n     <p>He spun right into an\
  \ avalanche of goblins. His knife sank into something solid and warm, but it didn't\
  \ matter. A skull clipped his jaw, cracking teeth together. With horror contorting\
  \ Serra's face, Jerrad sank beneath a wave of rending claws, biting teeth, and goblin\
  \ flesh.</p> \n     <p style=\"text-align: center;\">∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n     <p>Tyressa\
  \ leaped from the battlements and landed in a crouch. She gathered her skirts and\
  \ pulled the rear hem up between her legs, tucked it into her belt at the belly.\
  \ Cool air chilled bare feet. Another two steps and she picked up a stout stick.\
  \ Two more and she levered a hatchet free of the chopping block where they killed\
  \ chickens. With one stroke she slashed the stick into a sharpened stake, then stalked\
  \ into the night.</p> \n     <p>More screams drew her onward. She heard someone\
  \ yell \"Goblins!\" and thought it might be Jerrad. <i>At least he</i>'s alive.\
  \ She killed the urge to run to him. Panic would slay her, and then she'd be no\
  \ help to anyone.</p> \n     <p>The first goblin flew at her out of the darkness,\
  \ screeching as it came. Tyressa twisted, thrusting with her left hand. The stake\
  \ caught the goblin in the chest, but a skin vest prevented it from penetrating.\
  \ The creature giggled at its good fortune, then grew quiet as an overhand blow\
  \ with the hatchet split its skull.</p> \n     <p>Off to the right, one of the woodsmen\
  \ cleaved a goblin in half.</p> \n     <p>\"To me!\" </p> \n     <p>The man looked\
  \ up as she wrenched the hatchet from the skull, then ran to her, nodding as he\
  \ came. \"Goblins.\"</p> \n     <p>\"I see. I'd prefer highwaymen.\"</p> \n    \
  \ <p>\"My lady?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Bigger targets, and they don't bite.\" She raised\
  \ her voice. \"To me, Silverlake!\"</p> \n     <p>Tyressa had meant the call to\
  \ draw the settlers to her. A few came, one with an arm hanging limp and blood pouring\
  \ from his shoulder. More quickly, however, came the goblins, chittering and gibbering,\
  \ snarling and giggling insanely.</p> \n     <p>Off to the north one section of\
  \ the wall ignited in a wash of flames. Goblin silhouettes writhed across the landscape.\
  \ They piled up against the longhouse, standing on each other to get in the windows.\
  \ Knives cut some, broomsticks thrust others away. Yet more ran around carrying\
  \ off even the most inconsequential of trinkets. One had even slapped a boot on\
  \ its head, lacing the floppy helmet on beneath the chin.</p> \n     <p>All this\
  \ Tyressa took in with emotionless clarity. She didn't even allow herself anger,\
  \ because letting in one emotion would open the way for others. She thrust and cut\
  \ within her guard, remaining safe as her husband had taught her to do, yet missed\
  \ no opportunity to kill. The hatchet's dull end pulverized what the blade wouldn't\
  \ slice. A slap with the flat shattered bone. Goblins reeled away trying to press\
  \ their faces back into shape.</p> \n     <p>The wounded man went down, and the\
  \ goblins dragged him away. Tyressa closed ranks with the others. More goblins came\
  \ in a wave that broke against the ferocity of the settlers' defense. Blood splashed.\
  \ Sweat stung the countless scratches on her legs and forearms. Bones snapped. They\
  \ weren't hers, but one solid hatchet stroke sent a shock wave up into her shoulder,\
  \ and the dying goblin carried the hatchet away with it.</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  \      <br>Lady Tyressa understands that a true leader leads\n      <br> from the\
  \ front lines.\n     </div> \n     <p>\"They're running, my lady.\"</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ woodsman was right. <i>But that</i>'<i>s </i>not<i> right. </i>Tyressa frowned,\
  \ wiping her brow and smearing blood across it. The goblins <i>had </i>thinned,\
  \ scattering in all directions, but more were upright than dead or dying. <i>Why\
  \ would they break off the attack?</i></p> \n     <p>Then she felt it, through her\
  \ feet. Tremors in the ground, matching heavy footfalls. Something crashed through\
  \ the darkness, coming up from the lake. She couldn't tell what it was, other than\
  \ big. Whatever it was, the goblins knew better than to be anywhere near it. And\
  \ she'd have followed their example, except that she wasn't going to let anything\
  \ drive her from her home.</p> \n     <p style=\"text-align: center;\">∗ ∗ ∗</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Welinn huddled just inside the southernmost portion of the wall, cloaked\
  \ darkness. He could see plenty well through it, as could all the goblins. The problem\
  \ was, he couldn't see anything <i>but</i> goblins. Attacking, looting, setting\
  \ fires, dying, all he saw were goblins by the legion.</p> \n     <p>That wasn't\
  \ the way it was supposed to have worked. He, being of the Brambleclaw Tribe, had\
  \ gotten the blessing of his chief, then gathered a company of goblins. He'd told\
  \ them all the things the manlord wanted, especially about the scaring and the girl.\
  \ The scaring would be what earned him extra money, so he had stressed it to his\
  \ fellows.</p> \n     <p>He'd had a special thought in that regard. The manlord\
  \ had wanted the attack to come on the moonless night, but that made no real sense\
  \ if scaring was the object. If men couldn't see the goblins, how could they be\
  \ scared? They couldn't, so the plan had to be modified so there was enough light\
  \ to allow the scaring.</p> \n     <p>The Brambleclaws had taken the news about\
  \ scaring to heart. More than one approached him asking if they could invite a cousin,\
  \ since more would be scarier than less. Welinn had accepted the first few offers,\
  \ then started refusing, but no one had listened to him. Cousins had invited other\
  \ cousins, and it looked as if every goblin between Thornkeep and Silvershade Lake\
  \ had joined in.</p> \n     <p>Then he saw it. One of the goblins had gone to far\
  \ with scaring. <i>He invited Grakka.</i></p> \n     <p>The creature looked like\
  \ an ogre, but Welinn had heard it was of mixed blood—human or elf, though looking\
  \ at it the goblin couldn't have told which. The ogrekin lived alone in the wood,\
  \ having been driven from or escaped from Mosswater. It came dragging the lower\
  \ half of a sapling—complete with root ball, as it stalked up the slope from the\
  \ lake. The footfalls sounded as thunder and the ground shook.</p> \n     <p><i>Too\
  \ much scaring.</i> The goblin made himself as small as possible. He waited for\
  \ Grakka to pass, then Welinn snuck around the corner and darted into the night.<i>\
  \ </i>It didn't matter how much gold money the manlord would give him, it wouldn't\
  \ be enough to lurk within the ogrekin's bloody domain.</p> \n     <p style=\"text-align:\
  \ center;\">∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n     <p>Jerrad rolled and tried to heave a goblin off him.\
  \ He might have succeeded, he didn't know. His push included his knife, but he didn't\
  \ hear a grunt or scream. Then again, being at the heart of a ball of yowling, gouging,\
  \ gnawing goblins meant he couldn't make sense of much at all.</p> \n     <p><i>I\
  \ have to get free</i>. He fought panic and bit. He drove his knees into things.\
  \ He smashed his head backward into something which crunched. His left elbow slammed\
  \ against hardness, and his left hand closed on something squishy. He yanked. That\
  \ got a howl, then teeth closed on his right wrist and his knife went flying.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>He lashed out with everything he had, but the goblins weighed him down.\
  \ Any time he sent one flying, two more would pile on. He couldn't get a decent\
  \ breath. And something had a hand on the side of his head, trying to work his head\
  \ up to expose his throat. He fought it. Claws sank into his scalp. Blood ran. The\
  \ grip slipped for a second, then moved down and hooked beneath his jaw.</p> \n\
  \     <p>Then it was gone. Something hit with a solid thunk, and that goblin vanished.\
  \ Then another thump, and another. Weight left his legs, so he kicked. He arched\
  \ his back, then twisted, trying to get his hands under him.</p> \n     <p>Another\
  \ thump, and more weight evaporated.</p> \n     <p>And then he heard her voice.\
  \ \"Get. Off. Mouse!\"</p> \n     <p>Jerrad wriggled from the pile. As he stood,\
  \ two goblins came for him. An arrow splashed back to front through the throat of\
  \ the furthest, then struck the other in the back of the head. The razored broadhead\
  \ skewered the left eyeball on its way out. The goblin stiffened, viscous fluid\
  \ streaming down its face, then flopped to the ground.</p> \n     <p>Beyond it stood\
  \ Kiiryth, another arrow already fitted to his bow. He gave Jerrad a nod, then turned\
  \ and sped another shaft into the night. </p> \n     <p>Between them stood Serrana,\
  \ a four-foot length of pine sapling clenched tight in her fists. She whipped it\
  \ up and around, spraying blood and goblin brains all over, then crashed it down.\
  \ The blow pulped a goblin's bulbous head. The club rose again and struck the same\
  \ goblin.</p> \n     <p>\"Serra. <i>Serrana</i>!\"</p> \n     <p>She looked up at\
  \ him, feral fire burning in her eyes. Lips peeled back in a snarl. She flashed\
  \ a grin, then whirled and battered another dead goblin's skull into wet mush. \"\
  Get. Off. Mouse!\"</p> \n     <p>\"Serrana, its okay, they're off me.\"</p> \n \
  \    <p>His sister stopped for a moment, a thick, dark slurry running down over\
  \ her hands. \"Mouse?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Yes, Serrana. You saved me.\"</p> \n   \
  \  <p>\"I saved you.\"</p> \n     <p>Kiiryth closed with both of them. \"There are\
  \ more to save. To the longhouse, now.\"</p> \n     <p style=\"text-align: center;\"\
  >∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n     <p>Maraschal Sunnock stood alone in the chaos within the longhouse.\
  \ He'd gone there to give some last-minute orders to his servants concerning the\
  \ next day's journey. He'd heard the scream and seen forms running through the night\
  \ before someone had closed and barred the door. And even when a goblin thrust its\
  \ face through a window, he still couldn't believe it.</p> \n     <p><i>This is\
  \ wrong, all wrong!</i> His mouth went dry. <i>I wasn't supposed to be here.</i></p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"You, help us!\"</p> \n     <p>Sunnock looked up. One of the woodsmen\
  \ had joined two other men at the door, pushing back against a horde of goblins.\
  \ Boards began to creak. Nails squealed and worked free of the wood. The man waved\
  \ him forward and, dazed by disbelief, Sunnock joined him.</p> \n     <p>The second\
  \ his hands touched the door's wood, fear burst within his heart. Until that moment,\
  \ the attack had been an abstract thing. Here, leveraging his muscle against that\
  \ of the goblins, he could feel their insistence. They were avatars of gluttony\
  \ and hatred and greed. A knot in a board popped free, striking him in the face.\
  \ He stared out through it, eye to eye with a goblin.</p> \n     <p>Sunnock spun,\
  \ slamming his back against the door. People warded every window, stabbing and battering\
  \ goblins, shoving them back into the night. But there, toward the center, children\
  \ huddled with older folks. Faces ashen with fear, they looked toward him. His presence\
  \ gave them hope. They counted on him. He was their salvation.</p> \n     <p>For\
  \ a heartbeat before he realized the pressure on the door had slackened, Sunnock\
  \ felt like a hero. He understood that all the gold in the world couldn't buy the\
  \ sensation of having someone look upon you with gratitude for saving her life.\
  \ He was all that stood between them and the end of everything. His selflessness\
  \ would live on forever.</p> \n     <p>And it was that thought, as yet untainted\
  \ by wondering how he could turn that gratitude to his own advantage, which occupied\
  \ his mind the very moment the massive root ball exploded the door. Sharp oaken\
  \ splinters pierced him through and through. A heavy board crushed his skull. His\
  \ lifeless body flew into the room, bouncing and rolling to the edge of the circle\
  \ of people he had saved.</p> \n     <p>He never heard the terrified screams attesting\
  \ to his failure.</p> \n     <p style=\"text-align: center;\">∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n     <p>Jerrad\
  \ arrived at the longhouse's far end just as the huge, ugly beast struck his first\
  \ blow. Wood shattered. What had once been the door was now a jagged hole. People\
  \ screamed from beyond it.</p> \n     <p>Jerrad choked down fear. \"What is that?\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"Some unholy creature gotten on someone by an ogre.\" The archer's\
  \ eyes narrowed. \"Not full-blooded—usually called ogrekin—but just as nasty as\
  \ the purebreds.\"</p> \n     <p>The ogrekin tugged its club free. Eight feet tall,\
  \ with flesh the color of a bruised mushroom, the creature bulged with muscle. The\
  \ sheer power it could generate was terrifying enough, but its face could only be\
  \ described as blasphemous. One pointed ear sat lower than the other, and the pale\
  \ blue eye on the left had to be three times the diameter of the brown one on the\
  \ right. Yellow teeth were jumbled in a jaw that gaped open, and the nose had been\
  \ broken so many times Jerrad had to cant his head to make the nostrils line up\
  \ right.</p> \n     <p>Kiiryth's bow came up. The bowstring twanged as he loosed\
  \ an arrow. It pierced the monster's left shoulder, the broadhead emerging out the\
  \ back. Blood ran in rivulets down the arm and dripped from the arrow's tip.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The ogrekin didn't give the wound so much as a glance.</p> \n     <p>Tyressa,\
  \ butcher knife in one hand and fishing spear in the other, appeared and whistled\
  \ loudly. \"You're not welcome in my town.\"</p> \n     <p><i>Mother!</i> Jerrad\
  \ started toward her, but Kiiryth grabbed his collar and held him back.</p> \n \
  \    <p>\"You'd only slow her down.\"</p> \n     <p>The behemoth looked at her.\
  \ Contempt further warped its face. It snarled, flashing a tangle of uneven teeth.\
  \ The ogrekin reached for her with its left hand.</p> \n     <p>Tyressa ducked beneath\
  \ the attempted grab and circled around toward the monster's back. It turned to\
  \ keep with her, but its grip on the club slowed it. By the time the ogrekin had\
  \ pulled the club from the longhouse, Tyressa had darted in and slashed the thing's\
  \ right heel. Black blood sprayed from a deep cut over the tendon.</p> \n     <p>Tyressa\
  \ danced wide, carrying her outside the range of the ogrekin's swinging club. The\
  \ club came around and slammed into the longhouse's wall. It splintered boards and\
  \ snapped the corner post. The longhouse shifted, the wood closing like jaws on\
  \ the club, clinging to it with a fierce tenacity.</p> \n     <p>The ogrekin snarled\
  \ and set itself, muscles bunching in shoulders and back. The monster heaved, trying\
  \ to free the weapon. Wood groaned. Some nails squeaked as they came free, but the\
  \ building didn't release the club on that first attempt. So the behemoth planted\
  \ its feet and hauled back for all it was worth.</p> \n     <p>The damaged tendon\
  \ popped. The creature's right foot slid out from under it. The ogre landed hard\
  \ on the base of its spine. The tremor rattled teeth in Jerrad's head. The monster\
  \ threw its head back and howled in pain.</p> \n     <p>And a little bit in fear.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The people of Silverlake boiled from the longhouse. Woodsmen chopped\
  \ into the ogre's shoulders and wrists. People stabbed it, using knives, scythes,\
  \ and even sharp sticks. Kiiryth shot arrows into any exposed flesh. Even Serrana\
  \ charged in, battering it with her blood-stained club.</p> \n     <p>But Tyressa\
  \ slew it. As others hacked at its limbs, Jerrad's mother leaped onto the ogre's\
  \ chest. The monster's head came up. It hissed a challenge. Tyressa roared back,\
  \ the stepped on its throat and thrust the fishing spear straight through the larger\
  \ eye.</p> \n     <p>The ogre thrashed, ripping the spear from her hand and tossing\
  \ her into the crowd. Its death throes crushed one man and broke several others.\
  \ The people withdrew, weapons ready, as the monster thrashed out the last seconds\
  \ of its life, then cheered as it lay still.</p> \n     <p>Tyressa emerged from\
  \ the bloodthirsty throng bruised but otherwise unhurt.</p> \n     <p>Jerrad stared\
  \ at her, and wasn't alone. <i>You</i>'<i>re my mother, but </i>are<i> you my mother?</i></p>\
  \ \n     <p>Tyressa bent, resting hands on knees. She breathed heavily for a moment\
  \ or two, then let her skirt hem slip down and straightened up. She looked around,\
  \ then nodded.</p> \n     <p>\"This is a terrible night, but you've all done well.\
  \ See to yourselves. See to our wounded. Then we shall attend to our dead.\" She\
  \ wiped her bloody hands on her skirts. \"This is a night we mourn now, but shall\
  \ celebrate in the future. And because of you, Silverlake will <i>have</i> a future.\"\
