  \ Round 1 Results</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Thursday, October 11, 2007</p> \n\
  \   <p>The results for Round 1 of the <a href=\"http://paizo.com/store/paizo/gameMastery/modules\"\
  ><i>GameMastery Module</i></a> Open Call are in. It may have taken a marathon meeting,\
  \ about half a dozen cans of Diet Dr. Pepper, and a host of minis to play with while\
  \ we chatted... but it's finally done. In the end, we couldn't settle on 10 candidates\
  \ as initially promised, and instead decided to go with 12! Those who advanced will\
  \ have a little more than two weeks to submit a full outline, including sample encounters\
  \ and monsters.</p> \n   <p>All of the acceptance and rejection emails have now\
  \ been sent out, so you might want to go check you inbox right about now. Congratulations\
  \ to those who got accepted. For those of you who did not make the cut, do not despair:\
  \ we're combing through the entries to see if any of the monsters might make suitable\
  \ entries into the <a href=\"/pathfinder\"><i>Pathfinder</i></a> bestiary section.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>We got a lot of really great entries, and trimming them down was not an\
  \ easy task. There were a large number of proposals that probably would have made\
  \ for a great module, but unfortunately cuts had to be made. So keep an eye out\
  \ for future writing opportunities, for both the GameMastery Modules and Pathfinder\
  \ alike. Next time, we might pick you!</p> \n   <p>Didn't make the cut and want\
  \ to share your ideas with others? Feel free to <a href=\"http://paizo.com/paizo/messageboards/gameMastery/general/openCall\"\
