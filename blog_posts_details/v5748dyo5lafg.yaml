  artist: "10%, which eliminates it altogether in his case. Critical Mastery is a\
    \ fighter-only feat that allows Seltyiel to apply the effects of two critical\
    \ feats to a successful critical hit. In his case, that means that anyone who\
    \ is struck with a critical hit is both staggered (can only take a standard action\
    \ each round) and fatigued, thanks to Staggering Critical and Tiring Critical.\
    \ This is, of course, in addition to the 1d10 electricity damage"
