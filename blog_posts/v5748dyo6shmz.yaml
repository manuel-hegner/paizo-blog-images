  \    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">With <a href=\"http://www.paizo.com/paizocon\"\
  >PaizoCon Online</a> coming up and Year 3 on the horizon, we thought we’d take a\
  \ moment to talk about how to create a Pathfinder Society character and show you\
  \ the different options available to players. I’ve got my friends “Zonya” and “\
  Minda” here to help me out; any resemblance to actual persons with whom I work is\
  \ purely coincidental, I <em>assure</em> you.</p> \n     <p>For this blog, we’ll\
  \ be following the steps outlined in the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01zp3?Pathfinder-Core-Rulebook\"\
  >Pathfinder Core Rulebook</a> as well as the <a href=\"https://organizedplayfoundation.org/Lorespire/pfs2guide._.Character-Creation\"\
  >Character Creation section of the Guide to Organized Play</a>. </p> \n     <h3>Available\
  \ Character Options</h3> \n     <p>Pathfinder uses a system of rarity to describe\
  \ how widespread its rules options are in the game world. When building your character,\
  \ be sure to check the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/characteroptions\"\
  >Pathfinder Society Character Options page</a>, which describes how this rarity\
  \ system applies in Pathfinder Society. This page lists all of the books that have\
  \ rules you can use for your character, and details which rules are available to\
  \ you. It also provides some rules clarifications and other useful information.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>The Character Options page also lists the rules for owning copies\
  \ of the books. Generally, in order to use options from a book outside the Core\
  \ Sources (the <em>Core Rulebook</em>, <em>Pathfinder Bestiary</em> and the <em>Lost\
  \ Omens World Guide</em>), you must own the book where the option is published.\
  \ However, playing some adventures grants boons that let you use the options from\
  \ that adventure without owning the book.</p> \n     <p>Many Uncommon or Rare options\
  \ require a boon which can either be earned as a result of playing a particular\
  \ adventure or purchasing the boon with Achievement Points. Players/GMs earn Achievement\
  \ Points every time they play/run a game; if you’re looking for a quick way to boost\
  \ your AcP, join games at conventions, which grant bonus AcP. Games run at a local\
  \ game store or other event may also grant this bonus; check with the event’s organizer\
  \ to see if they qualify.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/a40151b8-8c55-4efb-b4a8-dca78fd65e39/042221_Introduction.jpg\"\

  \ \n     <h3>Creating a Concept</h3> \n     <p>Each of our three players have arrived\
  \ at their concepts differently. You can start wherever you like to find a concept:\
  \ pick a class or ancestry you’d like to try, a spell or ability you want to build\
  \ around, or just find inspiration in another fictional character!</p> \n     <p><b>Zonya</b>\
  \ is a seasoned Pathfinder Society (first edition) player, and wants to make the\
  \ jump to second edition to play with her friends. She knows she wants to play a\
  \ typical Pathfinder who upholds the core tenets of the Society: Explore, Report\
  \ and Cooperate.</p> \n     <p><b>Alex</b> recently picked up the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq023ih?Pathfinder-Advanced-Players-Guide\"\
  >Advanced Player’s Guide</a> and is enamored by the <a href=\"http://2e.aonprd.com/Classes.aspx?ID=14\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Oracle</a> options. He thinks they’re fun and full of flavor\
  \ and looks forward to playing up the curse drawbacks. He also has a ton of Achievement\
  \ Points, which he earned from playing and GMing Pathfinder Society games, so he’\
  s looking to spend some of them on some options.</p> \n     <p><b>Minda</b> only\
  \ plays <a href=\"http://2e.aonprd.com/Ancestries.aspx?ID=14\" target=\"_blank\"\
  >leshys</a>, it’s sort of her staple. Looking through the new <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq026k5?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Ancestry-Guide\"\
  ><em>Lost Omens Ancestry Guide</em></a>, she sees the art of the fruit leshy and\
  \ decides she wants to use it as inspiration.</p> \n     <h3>The ABCs of Character\
  \ Building</h3> \n     <p>Next, our players are going to select their ABCs: Ancestry,\
  \ Background and Class. These are the basic building blocks of any character; more\
  \ information can be found in Chapter 1 of the Pathfinder Core Rulebook. </p> \n\
  \     <p>Zonya had an orc character she loved to play in Pathfinder Society (First\
  \ Edition), so she’s going to build his daughter using the <a href=\"http://2e.aonprd.com/Ancestries.aspx?ID=8\"\
  >half-orc heritage</a>. To build for exploration, she decides this character is\
  \ a <a href=\"http://2e.aonprd.com/Classes.aspx?ID=9\">ranger</a> with an <a href=\"\
  http://2e.aonprd.com/AnimalCompanions.aspx\">animal companion</a>, with an eye to\
  \ taking the <a href=\"https://2e.aonprd.com/Feats.aspx?ID=1292\">Ferocious Beasts</a>\
  \ feat later. She’s also considering the <a href=\"http://2e.aonprd.com/Archetypes.aspx?ID=13\"\
  >Pathfinder Agent Archetype</a> for second level, to signify the character’s devotion\
  \ to the Pathfinder Society. It is an Uncommon archetype, but she sees it’s legal\
  \ for all characters on the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/characteroptions\"\
  >Character Options page</a>. For the background, she considers <a href=\"http://2e.aonprd.com/Backgrounds.aspx?ID=20\"\
  >Herbalist</a>, but eventually settles on <a href=\"http://2e.aonprd.com/Backgrounds.aspx?ID=32\"\
  >Scout</a>, deciding that as a Strength-based ranger, she wants to spend more time\
  \ ahead of the group in case of an ambush.</p> \n     <p>Alex is looking through\
  \ the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/Store.woa/wa/browse?path=organizedPlay/myAccount/rewards#tabs\"\
  >Boons section</a> of his My Organized Play page, and decides that the time has\
  \ come to purchase his <a href=\"http://2e.aonprd.com/Ancestries.aspx?ID=17\">Catfolk\
  \ Ancestry boon</a>. He registers the new character and purchases the boon, downloading\
  \ a copy to save for his records. As a <a href=\"http://2e.aonprd.com/Mysteries.aspx?ID=5\"\
  >Flames Mystery Oracle</a>, this character is looking to have excellent Reflex saves\
  \ and Acrobatics, so he decides to lean into that, taking the <a href=\"http://2e.aonprd.com/Feats.aspx?ID=2315\"\
  >Catfolk Dance feat</a> and the <a href=\"http://2e.aonprd.com/Heritages.aspx?ID=92\"\
  >Flexible Catfolk Heritage</a>. For Background, he goes with the <a href=\"http://2e.aonprd.com/Backgrounds.aspx?ID=2\"\
  >Acrobat</a> background, flavoring this character as a former performer who blended\
  \ their flames and acrobatic prowess to entertain the crowds.</p> \n     <p>Minda\
  \ is very familiar with the process to purchase the Leshy Ancestry boon from her\
  \ <a href=\"https://paizo.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/Store.woa/wa/browse?path=organizedPlay/myAccount/rewards#tabs\"\
  >Boons page</a>, and can practically do it in her sleep. Because <a href=\"http://2e.aonprd.com/Heritages.aspx?ID=100\"\
  >fruit leshys</a> produce fruit which heals, she decides to make them a <a href=\"\
  http://2e.aonprd.com/Classes.aspx?ID=5\">Cleric</a> to focus on healing. She’d love\
  \ to worship a <a href=\"http://2e.aonprd.com/Deities.aspx?ID=221\">Green Man</a>,\
  \ but unfortunately <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq027mn?Pathfinder-Bestiary-3\"\
  ><em>Bestiary 3</em></a> isn’t available yet on the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/characteroptions\"\
  >Character Options page</a>. Instead, she decides her deity is <a href=\"http://2e.aonprd.com/Deities.aspx?ID=8\"\
  >Gozreh</a>. A character can be fully rebuilt until they’re played at level 2, so\
  \ if Bestiary 3 is sanctioned soon, she might switch! As a <a href=\"http://2e.aonprd.com/Doctrines.aspx?ID=2\"\
  >Cloistered Cleric</a>, she gains the <a href=\"http://2e.aonprd.com/Feats.aspx?ID=265\"\
  >Domain Initiate Feat</a> so she can get <a href=\"http://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=467\"\
  >Vibrant Thorns</a> from the <a href=\"http://2e.aonprd.com/Domains.aspx?ID=22\"\
  >Nature domain</a>; it’s an Uncommon Spell, but the Feat grants her access.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The three players finish filling out their character sheets and purchase\
  \ equipment following the steps in the <em>Core Rulebook</em>. At this point, they\
  \ have complete Pathfinder characters, but Pathfinder Society adds a couple of extra\
  \ choices to make prior to your first game.</p> \n     <h3>Society Training and\
  \ Factions</h3> \n     <p>To represent a character’s involvement with the Society,\
  \ each character selects a <a href=\"https://organizedplayfoundation.org/Lorespire/pfs2guide._.Character-Creation#Membership_in_the_Pathfinder_Society\"\
  >Pathfinder Training option</a>. These options provide <a href=\"https://organizedplayfoundation.org/Lorespire/pfs2guide._.Player-Basics#Table_4-1_School_Consumables\"\
  >additional consumables</a> at the beginning of each scenario, or in the case of\
  \ a Field Commissioned agent, additional Downtime after each scenario.</p> \n  \
  \   <p>Zonya’s half-orc ranger heard about the Society in stories from her parents\
  \ growing up. As a result, Zonya decides to reflect this by taking the Scrolls training,\
  \ which grants Pathfinder Society Lore. She also plans to get some good use out\
  \ of the <a href=\"https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=90\"><em>eagle-eye elixir</em></a>\
  \ she’ll get for free each scenario.</p> \n     <p>Alex goes back and forth, but\
  \ eventually elects to make his catfolk oracle a Field Commissioned agent. This\
  \ will give him more Downtime to Earn Income with his Circus Lore, and he takes\
  \ the Mercantile Lore as his bonus. </p> \n     <p>Minda trains her leshy cleric\
  \ with the Spells school, figuring that there’s never a wrong time to have an extra\
  \ scroll of <em>heal</em> on hand, just in case. She takes the Herbalism Lore the\
  \ school offers as well.</p> \n     <p><a href=\"https://organizedplayfoundation.org/Lorespire/pfs2guide._.The-World-of-Golarion#Factions\"\
  >Factions</a> represent special interests within the Pathfinder Society. Characters\
  \ don’t have to choose just one faction; at the beginning of each session, you’\
  ll choose what faction to champion and earn reputation for at that table. Still,\
  \ it’s good to look over the factions and pick the one you’ll likely spend the most\
  \ time representing.</p> \n     <p>For our three sample characters, Zonya chooses\
  \ the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/factions/horizon-hunters\">Horizon\
  \ Hunters</a> for her ranger and Minda naturally chooses the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/factions/verdant-wheel\"\
  >Verdant Wheel</a> for her leshy. Alex is unsure, as none of the Factions feel perfectly\
  \ correct, so he’ll take the opportunity to let his character meet the faction leaders\
  \ in <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01znb?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-101-The-Absalom-Initiation\"\
  ><em>PFS #1-01: The Absalom Initiation</em></a> or the upcoming <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq027s8?Pathfinder-Society-Intro-2-United-in-Purpose\"\
  ><em>PFS Intro #2: United in Purpose</em></a>. Until then, he’ll take the default\
  \ option of the Horizon Hunters.</p> \n     <hr width=\"50%\"> \n     <p>And that’\
  s it! Our three players now have new Pathfinder Society characters, in no time at\
  \ all! Have any other tips for character building in PFS, or do you have a cool\
  \ new build you’re looking forward to fleshing out? Share them below!</p> \n   \
  \  <p>If you’re looking for more information on how to get involved with the Pathfinder\
  \ Society, contact your local <a href=\"https://paizo.com/organizedplay/regions\"\
  >Regional Venture Coordinator</a>, who can get you connected with the local lodge\
  \ in your area.</p> \n     <p>Come back next week for some Starfinder Society news.\
  \ Until then, don’t forget to Explore! Report! Cooperate! And roll up some new characters!</p>\
