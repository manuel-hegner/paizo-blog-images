  \ Society Organized Play, Part XIV: Loyalty to the Decemvirate Above All Else</h1>\
  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Monday, June 20, 2011</p> \n   <p><i>Regardless of a Pathfinder's\
  \ nation of origin, all members of the Society consider the Grand Lodge in Absalom\
  \ a second home. It is in this vast complex of sprawling towers, libraries, and\
  \ reliquaries that so many Pathfinders receive their training, and within the Grand\
  \ Lodge's walls, the masked leaders of the Society secretly guide the organization\
  \ from their chambers at the peak of Skyreach's central tower. While many Pathfinders\
  \ find their loyalty to the Society but one of several alliances to outside political\
  \ or religious factions, most Pathfinders hold the strongest allegiance to the will\
  \ of the Ten and the Pathfinder Society itself. Those who do not taint their dedication\
  \ with distractions from other superiors are the pride of the Grand Lodge, and are\
  \ rewarded for always putting the orders of the Decemvirate before their own personal\
  \ wants and desires.</i></p> \n   <div align=\"right\"> \n    <table border=\"0\"\

  \   <p>Since very early in the Pathfinder Society Organized Play campaign's history,\
  \ folks have asked not to belong to a faction, wanting to play a Pathfinder first\
  \ and foremost. Because of the nature of Prestige Points and the prominence of faction\
  \ missions as an integral part of Pathfinder Society Scenarios, doing so hasn't\
  \ been possible to date. But with the advent of five new factions, we saw the opportunity\
  \ to give these dedicated Pathfinder agents what they were looking forâ€”a way to\
  \ play a blue-blooded Pathfinder within the faction system. And thus, the Grand\
  \ Lodge faction was born.</p> \n   <p>Headed by the Grand Lodge's chamberlain and\
  \ steward, Venture-Captain Ambrus Valsin, the Grand Lodge faction rewards Pathfinders\
  \ who put the interests of the Decemvirate and the Pathfinder Society above all\
  \ else. Members of this faction will still get a distinct faction mission each scenario,\
  \ but their tasks will often coincide with the overall adventure objective or otherwise\
  \ serve to promote loyalty to the Decemvirate and the well-being of the Pathfinder\
  \ Society as a whole.</p> \n   <p>In the upcoming <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy8g79\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Society Field Guide</i></a>, each faction will receive a full-page\
  \ write-up including a headshot of the faction head, an overview of the typical\
  \ member of the group, and a hint at how those loyal to the cause increase their\
  \ Fame score within their faction. In addition to this flavorful background, each\
  \ faction will feature a handful of new boons that may be unlocked with Fame and\
  \ purchased with Prestige Points, available only to members of that faction. Check\
  \ out the following boon available to Grand Lodge Pathfinders who attain a Fame\
  \ score of at least 20 and spend 2 Prestige Points:</p> \n   <p></p>\n   <blockquote>\n\
  \    <b>Aspis Hunter (Fame 20, 2 PP)</b> You gain special training in foiling the\
  \ efforts of the Society's largest external enemy, the Aspis Consortium. You gain\
  \ a +1 bonus on attack rolls and on weapon damage rolls against Aspis agents who\
  \ wear clearly visible insignia showing their affiliation and rank.\n   </blockquote>\n\
  \   <p></p> \n   <p>One new faction down, and only three months after we first announced\
  \ the number of factions would be doubling next season. From here out, it's all\
  \ new factions, all the time until just before Gen Con, so stay tuned to this spot\
  \ each week for a glimpse at the next one. In one week's time, I'll give the first\
  \ glimpse at the Lantern Lodge, the Tian-aligned faction within the Pathfinder Society.</p>\
