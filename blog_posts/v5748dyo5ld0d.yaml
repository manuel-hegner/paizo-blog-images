  \  <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, January 17, 2012</p> \n    <p>I’ll be honest with\
  \ you. I love maps. I always have, so when Erik, Wes, and Jason asked me if I wanted\
  \ to start designing the Map Packs and Flip-Maps for the GameMastery line, I just\
  \ yelled, “Gimme!” Then I ran away, laughing manically with my new toy.</p> \n \
  \   <div class=\"blurb180\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/011712-Sketch.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/011712-Sketch_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n   \
  \  <br> This is a section of the “artwork” I sent to Jason for Flip-Mat: Pirate\
  \ Ship. It’s ugly, but gets the point across, which is the purpose of the sketch.\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>By designing maps, I don’t mean that I actually do the cartography.\
  \ That’s a job for far more artistically savvy folk, like the talented Jason Engle,\
  \ who is currently doing the artistic heavy lifting for these products. But before\
  \ we can have Jason do his magic, there is a lot of work and planning that goes\
  \ into each of these products. This week, I’m going to hijack the blog to shed some\
  \ light on the process of designing a GameMastery Map Pack or Flip-Mat product.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Each map product starts out as a vague concept on the product schedule.\
  \ I say vague concept, but there is actually a lot of thought that goes into the\
  \ concept phase. A few of us sit around the table, look at the current map products\
  \ we have available, determine which ones sold well, which ones didn’t, and rifle\
  \ though the Paizo messageboards about such products and see what kind of things\
  \ the fans liked, what they didn’t, and what kind of things they would like to see\
  \ in the future. Often, a Map Pack or a Flip-Mat is meant to complement Pathfinder\
  \ products set for release around the same period of time.</p> \n    <p>For instance,\
  \ both the upcoming <a href=\"/products/btpy8mor\"><i>Map Pack: Ship’s Cabins</i></a>\
  \ and the <a href=\"/products/btpy8mon\"><i>Flip-Mat: Pirate Ship</i></a> were expressly\
  \ designed to complement the Skull &amp; Shackles Adventure Path. Sure, each of\
  \ these products features cool ships that you could use in any campaign, but each\
  \ one also details ships that the PCs actually use in that Adventure Path. Because\
  \ of this dual purpose, I worked closely with Rob McCreary (Adventure Path developer\
  \ extraordinaire) to make sure that each map product would have everything that\
  \ he and the AP designers would need for that project. This give-and-take started\
  \ with Rob giving me preliminary information about the AP adventures, particularly\
  \ encounters taking place on the various ships. From there, I put together rough\
  \ sketches of the maps and had Rob give me feedback on them. That feedback often\
  \ forced me to go back to the drawing board, create a new round of rough sketches,\
  \ and then we would start the process all over again, iterating until everything\
  \ was right.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb180\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/011712-Final.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/011712-Final_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n    \
  \ <br> Jason Engle’s final product using my rough sketch and area descriptions as\
  \ direction. The final product is beautiful and spot on. Jason rocks!\n    </div>\
  \ \n    <p>While the maps connected to the Skull &amp; Shackles Adventure Path were\
  \ a little more cooperation-intensive than most map projects, every early map product\
  \ process starts with brainstorming, rough sketching, and making sure all the stakeholders\
  \ are happy with the initial map design. Once that’s achieved, the next step is\
  \ to make those rough sketches something more concrete—more than just a bunch of\
  \ pencil scribbles on graph paper. They have to be something that an artist can\
  \ understand clearly and easily. This involves cleaner maps sketched with my set\
  \ of gaudy-but-striking colored pens and a map order that lists all the important\
  \ details of the map. These refined rough sketches and the map order then goes to\
  \ the art department. The art director, Sarah Robinson, then takes a look, makes\
  \ sure it is as clear as possible, asking me questions about things that seem vague\
  \ or somewhat questionable, revisions are made again if necessary, and then she\
  \ sends it to Jason for beautification.</p> \n    <p>The process does not end there,\
  \ though. Jason sends us his preliminary work on the maps, usually in the form of\
  \ a black-and-white “sketch,” which is nearly complete, except for the color. We\
  \ then take a look at his work, making sure that all of the details presented in\
  \ my initial drawings and map order are all there, and take a critical eye at the\
  \ often wondrous details he provides. Once that’s done, we either send a list of\
  \ small changes or—more often than not—just let Jason know that his work is spot\
  \ on and then move on to the next step: final or nearly final turnover by the artist.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>With the color maps in, we look over them carefully, making sure everything\
  \ looks gorgeous and the details are correct, and then move on to last-minute approvals\
  \ from all the stakeholders and the business team. On rare occasions, the map goes\
  \ back for some last-minute tweaking. When we are all happy with the final result,\
  \ packaging is designed, and the files get sent to the printer. Lastly, the product\
  \ gets shipped out to subscribers and distributors. It’s final journey ends with\
  \ the “ooohs” and “aaahs of players” as GMs everywhere plop the finished product\
  \ on the game table before uttering that magical phrase, “Roll initiative.”</p>\
