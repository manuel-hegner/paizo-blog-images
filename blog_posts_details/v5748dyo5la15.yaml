  artist: "presenting an honest-to-goodness mystery in a fantasy setting, The Samarkand\
    \ Solution pushes the envelope even farther by adding an element of the classic\
    \ \"buddy cop\" film. Toss in Setne's desperate attempts to avoid the attentions\
    \ of the—*ahem*—affectionate and beautiful Lady Xonaapi, and the novel ends up\
    \ somewhat racier than its predecessor as well. But really, for me, reading a\
    \ Gygax novel is all about the magic, and Samarkand certainly doesn't disappoint\
    \ on that count, as can be seen in the following excerpt: A gigantic mass of living\
    \ flames shifted, hot-violet spots fixing themselves upon the magister as if they\
    \ were eyes. In fact they were eyes, and red-orange fires parted and a mouth spoke.\
    \ \"You come to your death, fool! Run away, little man, or I shall sear your flesh\
    \ and boil your blood ere I consume you!\" \"If you thought you could do that,\
    \ efreet, you'd act, not boast,\" Inhetep shouted back. \"Return now to your infernal\
    \ realm, or it is I who will quench you!\" Although the magister had expected\
    \ to encounter some form of creature"
