  \ \n   <br> \n   <h1>From Delve to Dungeon</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday,\
  \ August 14, 2007</p> \n   <p>If you're a regular reader of this blog, you likely\
  \ already know about Paizo's delve event at this year's GenCon, in which convention\
  \ attendees will have the chance to run through part of a deadly, trap-filled dungeon,\
  \ potentially winning fabulous prizes. You also probably know that the delve is\
  \ closely related to the new GameMastery Module we'll be releasing, <i><a href=\"\
  /store/v5748btpy7wiz\">D2: Seven Swords of Sin</a></i>. But what most people don't\
  \ know is exactly how one became the other...</p> \n   <p>The Paizo delve was written\
  \ as part of an informal internal contest to see who could write the deadliest,\
  \ most creative dungeon rooms for a set map within a certain EL range. Each of the\
  \ interested staff members (after deciding the pecking order by rolling initiative,\
  \ of course) took turns choosing until all of the chambers were parceled out, then\
  \ took their best shots. The resulting mishmash of horror was then edited, judged\
  \ highly entertaining, and pronounced ready to be Paizo's first GenCon delve. </p>\
  \ \n   <p>But somewhere in the early stages of the project, an idea began to form.\
  \ Suppose someone had a really good time with the delve, and wanted to take it home\
  \ to their own party? What if we could have an adventure module there at the show\
  \ that incorporated most of the delve, plus a bunch of extra material? The decision\
  \ was made, and I was tapped to give form and structure to our cruel meat grinder\
  \ of a dungeon.</p> \n   <p>It wasn't always easy. A delve, for instance, needs\
  \ only the barest plot—when each party's only playing for a few minutes, it's hard\
  \ to get much roleplaying in. For a writer like me who is, admittedly, more of a\
  \ story fan than an out-and-out brawler, it was an interesting challenge. Where\
  \ in our world, for instance, could adventurers reasonably expect to find such a\
  \ varied an eclectic collection of rooms? The answer, as it turns out, is the anarchic\
  \ squatter's paradise of Kaer Maga, a cliff-top city housed inside the walls of\
  \ an enormous Thassilonian artifact. Possibly the freest of Varisia's fiercely independent\
  \ cities (if the most morally questionable), the background material on Kaer Maga\
  \ remains my favorite part of this module—so much so that we return to it in the\
  \ third installment of the Pathfinder's Journal. But more on that next week. </p>\
  \ \n   <p>Even with a location, however, we still needed a story capable of tying\
  \ fiendish dinosaur-riding goblins to eladrin warriors and vampire bladepriests.\
  \ Once we figured out that Tirana was trying to combine the weapons of the Runelords'\
  \ ancient champions for her own personal gain, it seemed to me that the natural\
  \ setting for such a bold experiment would be in a secret, abandoned research facility.\
  \ Armed with that knowledge, the next step was to trim off the rooms that just didn't\
  \ fit and retool the ones to make them work together as a unit. Following that came\
  \ the writing of the new rooms—because you didn't think we'd just repackage the\
  \ delve, did you? No, if you get a chance to go to GenCon and see the massive tables\
  \ covered with three-dimensional dungeon terrain, be sure to keep in mind that all\
  \ of those rooms amount to about half of the actual adventure. For many of the extra\
  \ chambers, I enjoyed playing up the research facility aspect, complete with incinerators,\
  \ recycling units, turbines for proper air circulation, and laboratories with strange\
  \ new monsters run amuck. And, of course, no module set in a city is complete without\
  \ at least one gang turf war.</p> \n   <p>All told, writing D2 was a unique experience,\
  \ and I hope that those of you who read through it have as much fun as I did. Next\
  \ week I'll be back with a bit more information about Kaer Maga.</p> \n   <p>James\
