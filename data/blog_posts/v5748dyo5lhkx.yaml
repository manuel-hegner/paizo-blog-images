  \ I know there's been a rash of these \"So-and-So's Best Character Ever\" blogs\
  \ going around, but all of them have been lies. LIES! And on this most frabjous\
  \ of days, I'm here to tell you which PACG character is actually the best. For real\
  \ cats this time.</p> \n     <p>It's Ezren!!! If you know me, you probably saw that\
  \ coming. I love old people, especially the curmudgeonly sorts. I can identify with\
  \ them. If you don't know me, let me illustrate my point. When you sit down to play\
  \ a cooperative game, are you there to make friends and help people? Oh, you are?\
  \ That's lovely. Not me. I mean, it's kind of a miracle you got me to sit down to\
  \ a cooperative game in the first place (how can I crush you if we're on the same\
  \ team?), but you can bet if you did, I'm gonna be real Ezren about it.</p> \n \
  \    <p>What exactly does \"be real Ezren about it\" mean? Basically, I'm there\
  \ to pick up some sweet spells, blow up some monster faces (I sure hope the number\
  \ of faces to heads is a 1:1 ratio), and generally be a badass. I'm not there to\
  \ give you a d4 when you need to do better, and I'm not there to cure you. You shouldn't\
  \ need curing. Stop taking damage. Learn to be old and tough, like Ezren!</p> <span\

  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-EzrenFront_180.jpeg\"\

  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-EzrenBack_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n     </div> \n     <p>Have you checked out Ezren's card list? And starting\
  \ powers? SPELL ALL THE THINGS! Choo choo magic train!!! If you set your deck up\
  \ right and go to the right locations, you'll be an unstoppable exploration machine.\
  \ And yeah, Ezren may have a couple allies, but let's be honest, he doesn't give\
  \ a hoot who they are. He just needs them to get some more explorations in case\
  \ cards that have the Magic trait are scarce. As far as Ezren is concerned, those\
  \ \"friends\" can go right in the woodchipper.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n      <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-Evoker.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-Evoker_180.jpeg\"\

  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-Illusionist_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n     </div> \n     <p>And those roles! Add to your checks with spells! Add\
  \ to your checks to get spells! Add to your checks to recharge your cards! BE UNSTOPPABLE.\
  \ With a blast blast here and a blast blast there, here a blast, there a blast,\
  \ everywhere a BOW TO EZREN, FOOLS! And if straight-up blasting isn't your style,\
  \ there's always the tricksy illusion side of Ezren. Not to mention the roles you\
  \ can get with the Wizard Class Deck version of Ezren. Ch-ch-ch-check 'em out!</p>\
  \ \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6807-Transmorgrifier.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6807-Transmorgrifier_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6807-HedgeWizard.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6807-HedgeWizard_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n     </div> \n     <p>So, I made a big fuss about Ezren not being here to\
  \ make friends or help people and to me, he'll never be a grandfatherly-type wizard.\
  \ But the Ezren from the Class decks is a little more friendly. Also, HAVE YOU SEEN\
  \ THAT TRANSMOGRIFIER TRANSMOGRIFYING? That's not a monster, it's a teapot! Hand\
  \ size 6? I think you mean hand size 10! This boon? NO! That boon! There's also\
  \ that Hedge Wizard, the most helpful Ezren of all. That's right, I said it. Helpful\
  \ Ezren. Ermahgerd. You know what that means, right? Ezrens helping Ezrens. COWER\
  \ IN FEAR, MORTALS!</p> \n     <p>Another lovely aspect of Ezren is that he cares\
  \ about blessings about as much as he cares about your feelings. Other characters\
  \ rely on their blessings like amateurs rely on their queen during a chess game.\
  \ Ain't nobody got time for gods, least of all Ezren. He's making up for lost time\
  \ and exploring the world, and he won't get bogged down by deities or their zealots.\
  \ Word on the street is that Ezren is making a comeback in Mummy's Mask, and that\
  \ he might have some blessings this time around. Of course, he has no interest in\
  \ <i>Divine</i> blessings.</p> \n     <p>Alright folks, you've spent enough time\
  \ reading about why I think Ezren is the best. Now you should go get all the versions\
  \ of Ezren you can get your hands on. (In case you were wondering, that's fourâ€”\
  two roles from Runelords, and two from the Wizard Class Deck. YOU COULD BE FOUR\
  \ DIFFERENT EZRENS ALL AT ONE TIME!) Why are you still sitting here? Get off my\
  \ lawn, and go play some PACG!</p> \n     <h2>Meanwhile, Back at the Ranch...</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>Some of the PACG folks were at Origins this past week. Wave to Tanis,\
  \ Chad, Mike, and Paul, readers! They worked super hard all week and received some\
  \ fancy loot! SHINY!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20150609-Vanguard.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n      <br> <i><b>Type:</b> Loot<br> <b>Check to Acquire:</b> Be awesome!<br>\
  \ <b>Powers:</b> Reveal this card to add 2d12 to your anything.</i>\n     </div>\
  \ \n     <p>Anyway, we're real excited to have something that will allow us to make\
  \ \"it was Colonel Mustard, in the library, with the Vanguard Award\" jokes. Thanks\
  \ so much for all your support! Our game wouldn't be in the place it is without\
  \ all of you... or without Ezren. We should probably all just thank Ezren for this.\
  \ He is the best, after all.</p> \n     <p>Gaby Weidling<br> <i>Pathfinder Adventure\
