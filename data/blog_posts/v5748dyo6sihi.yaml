  \     <blockquote>\n      <p>Here’s a look behind the scenes at our PAX Unplugged\
  \ demo!</p>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Hiya, it’s me Jenny Jarzabski (Senior\
  \ Developer) reporting in from the field! I got to spread some Veskmas cheer by\
  \ running the playtest demo at Pax Unplugged, and I’m here to tell you all about\
  \ it! This playtest is an encounter designed to test out some of the basic rules\
  \ of Starfinder Second Edition. Reading on might spoil the demo’s content, so for\
  \ those of you planning to attend Owlcon (in February) or Norwescon (in March) where\
  \ some Starfinder team members might be running this demo, you’ve been warned!</p>\n\

  >Here’s Jenny GMing for one of many amazing demo tables at PAXU!</p>\n      </div>\n\
  \      <br>\n      <p><b>PAXU Demo</b><br><b>Map</b>: <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02ee8\"\
  >Starfinder Flip-Mat: Mining Operation</a><br><b>Character Level</b>: 3rd</p>\n\
  \      <p>The goal of this demo was to test out what we’ve been working on internally\
  \ with a wider pool of players and see some early reactions from the community.\
  \ I won’t be going into extreme detail about everything we tested in the demo, especially\
  \ since some of those rules may have changed after we implemented feedback and prepared\
  \ the Playtest Rulebook for the printer over the past two weeks! If you want the\
  \ full experience, you’ll have to find me or one of my teammates at an upcoming\
  \ convention or wait for the next batch of demos we’ll no doubt be cooking up for\
  \ GenCon!</p>\n      <p>Players chose from the following premade characters:</p>\n\
  \      <ul>\n       <li>Envoy</li>\n       <li>Mystic</li>\n       <li>Operative</li>\n\
  \       <li>Solarian</li>\n      </ul>\n      <p><b>The Fight</b><br>\n        The\
  \ players approached from the north of a seemingly abandoned mining site strewn\
  \ with cranes, vehicles, crates, and other large objects providing that sweet, sweet\
  \ cover. A massive pit in the center of the map created an obstacle for characters\
  \ favoring melee combat styles. But these lucky gamers were playing a game that\
  \ favors ranged combat (YEEHAW!) so they all had a ranged damage option in the form\
  \ of guns! <em>Pew pew pew</em>! Even so, some attacks and abilities perform better\
  \ in closer quarters. The solarian’s playstyle focuses on getting close to enemies\
  \ and hitting them with powerful attacks from their solar weapons, and some of the\
  \ mystic’s spells don’t work from too far away—so not everyone thought it was a\
  \ good idea to camp out at the edge of the map behind the safety of cover. (Just\
  \ the operative. Always. So tacticool.)</p>\n      <p>As the players investigated\
  \ the mine, a trio of pirates popped out from behind cover and fired the first shots\
  \ of the battle. These pirates were packing guns of their own—machine guns! This\
  \ meant they could shoot from a distance or get close and unleash a rain of bullets\
  \ on multiple targets with automatic fire. The pirates’ tactics were to shoot once\
  \ from a distance, then move in and switch to spraying auto-fire to <em>pew pew\
  \ </em>as many of their enemies as possible.</p>\n      <br>\n      <p><b>Tactics\
  \ and Playtesting</b><br>\n        Changing the pirates’ tactics changed the encounter.\
  \ I experimented with some different tactics and eventually settled into a routine\
  \ of two pirates following their normal tactics, while a third perched behind a\
  \ toolchest (cover) on top of the crane. Sometimes, it was like running two battles\
  \ in one: a sniper fight between crane guy and the operative, and the chaos of machine\
  \ gun space pirates versus everyone else. Other times, the players disrupted this\
  \ setup—they gravity welled crane guy off his perch, attacked him with his own shadow,\
  \ and more! Poor crane guy!</p>\n      <p>The point is, different groups always\
  \ used different tactics. Patterns emerged, of course. Generally, the operative\
  \ hung back and kept in cover while sniping, while the mystic slung spells and <em>pew\
  \ pew</em>’d from a medium distance. Sometimes the mystic even got into melee and\
  \ used their painglaive to share their emotions with the enemy on a more personal\
  \ level. The solarian usually charged into battle, either going after the sniper\
  \ (RIP crane guy) and using abilities to try to drag him off his perch or intercepting\
  \ the gunners on their way toward the party. The envoy had a lot of choices between\
  \ shooting and giving directives like Get in There! to boost everyone’s speed, or\
  \ Kiss It Better to “heal” someone with temporary HP. No two groups I GM’d for used\
  \ exactly the same combination of actions. Considering each premade character only\
  \ contained a snapshot of the rules we’ll be playtesting later this year, you should\
  \ expect a lot of fun choices when you build your first playtest characters.</p>\n\
  \      <p><strong>A Note About Pregens<br></strong> he StarFriends (as we members\
  \ of the Starfinder team call ourselves) each designed one of the premade characters\
  \ available for the demo. Dustin created the mystic, Jessica whipped up an envoy,\
  \ Mike crafted a solarian, and Jenny built an operative. Thursty designed the encounter,\
  \ so we gave the boss a pass this time!</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n\

  \ <br>\n      <p><strong>Bonus Encounter<br></strong> If the players ROFLstomped\
  \ the pirates, say with a string of crits, the demo had a second encounter loaded\
  \ in the chamber so the demo wouldn’t run disappointingly short. A fourth pirate\
  \ gunner and his hacked robot ally emerged from a building and attacked the party\
  \ right after they defeated the pirates. The robot advanced and went <em>pew pew\
  \ pew </em>with its laser rifle while the pirate crept up behind it, using her hacked\
  \ tank-bot as mobile cover until she reached spray-and-pray range. The robot might\
  \ power down at half HP or use its healing nanites to keep fighting longer, depending\
  \ on the group. Only a handful of groups played the bonus encounter, including the\
  \ Cosmic Critters. More about that in a minute.</p>\n      <p><strong>A Veskmas\
  \ Miracle<br></strong>Playing games with nufriends in the community is always a\
  \ great time. Thanks to all you gamers at PAX: Unplugged who wandered over to the\
  \ Paizo tables to try Starfinder 2. Thank you to the GMs who volunteered their time\
  \ to run demo tables—y’all are some space badasses!</p>\n      <p>Speaking of space\
  \ badasses, in addition to the public playtests, I had the honor of playing the\
  \ demo with the wonderful casts of Atomless, Cosmic Crit, and No Quest for the Wicked.\
  \ They really kept me on my toes with their rolls and roleplay. You can listen to\
  \ the Cosmic Critmas demo <a href=\"https://cosmiccrit.com/\">here</a>; my sessions\
  \ with Atomless and No Quest are coming soon!</p>\n      <p><strong>But I Want More!</strong><br>\n\
  \        Do you want more teasers about the playtest rules? Are you looking for\
  \ spoilers before release? Interested in more detailed notes about our internal\
  \ playtesting? Stay tuned to this space for more news from the StarFriends SOON™\
