  \ GAMA Trade Show, where I intend to show off about half of June's <a href=\"/products/btpy9bc6\"\
  ><em>Dungeons Deep</em></a> set for our <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder\
  \ Battles</a> line of prepainted plastic gaming figures. In preparation for that,\
  \ WizKids sent us a very early production set of the figures, and I've got to say,\
  \ I'm absolutely THRILLED with how this set has turned out!</p> \n    <p>For starters,\
  \ the <a href=\"/products/btpy9bep\">Gargantuan Red Dragon</a> limited edition \"\
  case incentive\" figure is one of the best figures we've done to date, and easily\
  \ ranks as my favorite <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder Battles</a> dragon\
  \ thus far. From the moment I set the figure up in my office I've had a parade of\
  \ Paizonians pounding on my door to get a closer look. It's phenomenal.</p> \n \
  \   <p>I'm also pleased with the general <i>utility</i> of the <a href=\"/products/btpy9bc6\"\
  ><em>Dungeons Deep</em></a> set. From \"dungeon dressing\" props like chests and\
  \ braziers to enemies like four different gnoll figures, a large ooze, and dungeon\
  \ critters like giant centipedes and beetles, I see the figures in this set hitting\
  \ game tables again and again, which really excites me.</p> \n    <p>Here's an early\
  \ look at three additional figures that I'm excited about, even more so now that\
  \ I've got production-run samples in-hand.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150313-Deinonychus_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>First up this week is the Deinonychus, a creepy little\
  \ dinosaur from page 84 of the <a href=\"/products/btpy8auu\"><em>Pathfinder RPG\
  \ Bestiary</em></a>. We're excited about this guy not just because he's a dinosaur,\
  \ but because it's one of our first chances to create a feathered dinosaur more\
  \ in fitting with modern science's understanding of how dinosaurs might actually\
  \ have looked. As a common, Medium miniature, <a href=\"/products/btpy8o6b\">case\
  \ subscribers</a> can be sure to get a whole pack of them to menace their player\
  \ characters.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150313-Bat.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150313-Bat_120.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Previous animals like <a href=\"/products/btpy96r0\"\
  >ravens</a>, <a href=\"/products/btpy96qy\">falcons</a>, and even <a href=\"/products/btpy9aay\"\
  >pigs</a> have proven popular additions to the <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder\
  \ Battles</a> line. Now that we're venturing into the dungeon, it's only fitting\
  \ that we include the Bat in <a href=\"/products/btpy9bc6\"><em>Dungeons Deep</em></a>.\
  \ The Bat is a Small, common figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n   \
  \  <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150313-GnollLeader.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150313-GnollLeader_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>I mentioned gnolls up above. This guy here, the Gnoll\
  \ Leader, is perfect for the Big Boss of a gnoll encounter. His breastplate even\
  \ has the symbol of the evil beast-god Rovagug printed on it. Awesome! The Gnoll\
  \ Leader is a Medium, rare figure.</p> \n    <p>That's it for this week. Expect\
  \ a bunch of cool photos to leak out of the GAMA Trade Show next week. I'll still\
  \ be in Las Vegas next Friday, so there's a good chance those photos won't show\
  \ up here until a week from next Friday, but keep your eyes on the Internet.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>They'll be out there!</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p>\
