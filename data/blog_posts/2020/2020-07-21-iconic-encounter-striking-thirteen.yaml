  >“Now, mister, why would you bother yourself with questions like those?”</p>\n \
  \             <p>Quinn put down the brass cup he was drinking from and closed the\
  \ open journal in front of him. “It’s unfortunately my job, ma’am.”</p>\n      \
  \        <p>“And it’s a terrible job indeed, for such a handsome fellow,” the waitress\
  \ mused. She tilted her pitcher of wine over his cup, and while the man was sure\
  \ he’d had enough, he didn’t protest. “It’s such a gruesome thing for you to busy\
  \ yourself with.”</p>\n              <p>“Someone’s got to be so busy.” He smirked,\
  \ reaching into his pocket for a handful of coins and placing them in the waitress’\
  s free hand. “Thank you for your assistance.”</p>\n              <p>The woman blushed\
  \ at his touch, bowing as she stepped away. Quinn sipped from the now brimming cup\
  \ of alcohol as he turned his attention back to his notes, the ones he had taken\
  \ in his mind carefully as she spoke. This would be the eleventh body so far. He\
  \ hadn’t seen it yet, but it was still fresh, and nearby—in an alley beside the\
  \ rented homes at the docks, barely minutes of walking from the tavern he sat in.\
  \ If the city’s own guards hadn’t moved it—and he was confident they wouldn’t, not\
  \ until daylight had burned away most of their fear—then tonight was a good chance\
  \ to get a look of his own.</p>\n              <p>The grim crime occurred near Augustana’\
  s thriving docks, and Quinn knew which alley the victim lay in when the smell of\
  \ rum and saltwater gave way to the overpowering stench of death as he approached.\
  \ He held a torch above his head as he stepped into the dark toward the body. The\
  \ corpse itself was as all the others, at least at first blush. It was dressed in\
  \ the robes of the Skinsaw Cult, laying spread-eagle at the center of the scene.\
  \ They had been exsanguinated, one clean deep cut to the neck letting all of their\
  \ precious lifeblood out into a receptacle that was no longer at the scene, but\
  \ left its round red ring of blood on the cobblestones as evidence.</p>\n      \

  \ </div>\n              <p>The one difference between this scene and the others\
  \ had been the first thing that Quinn saw, but he wanted to save his assessment\
  \ of it for last. On the wall behind the body lay concentric painted circles of\
  \ blood making a crude clock, skeletal arms pointing at the twelve and thirteen\
  \ numerals. It was peculiar in ways that ultimately felt distracting. These cultists\
  \ loved their gaudy death imagery—the skulls and bones and blood and exquisitely\
  \ mannequined carcasses—all meant to elicit terror and leave those who witnessed\
  \ their handiwork unable to shake the thought of the gruesome scene. As a rule,\
  \ however, there was always something more meaningful beneath the theater, some\
  \ misstep of a lazy mind, a revelation to be uncovered by the quick-witted.</p>\n\
  \              <p>Quinn stared at the macabre clock, waiting for it to reveal something\
  \ deeper the its obvious message of intimidation and horror. It went up to thirteen\
  \ hours—that would have been simple enough to dismiss as over-relying on superstition,\
  \ but then why point at twelve? There were also the bones themselves. The body did\
  \ have its arms split lengthwise, the skeleton severed at the joints for the bones\
  \ to slip out as much as possible without disturbing the muscle beyond them. The\
  \ arms nailed to the wall, however, did not belong to this victim. It took barely\
  \ a moment of Quinn’s forensic acumen to tell. For one thing, there was a short\
  \ hand, as all clocks were wont to have, but both limbs were still longer than the\
  \ corpse’s. Each of these arms, then, must be another victim’s injury.</p>\n   \
  \           <p>He paused to consider if that would be a useful hunch. That was where\
  \ they pointed: to the twelfth and thirteenth bodies, somewhere waiting to be found\
  \ among the ports of the Inner Sea. But why hint at them now? The murderer had so\
  \ far never left any clues to a further kill. Perhaps he had learned that he was\
  \ being followed, and the thrill had changed from the lust for blood to the game\
  \ of not being caught. Quinn winced. “Please, don’t be one of the clever ones,”\
  \ he muttered.</p>\n              <p>Quinn knelt and turned over the opened arms\
  \ of the corpse with the tip of his cane, to check the rest of the man’s skin. The\
  \ corpse’s nails were clean and manicured, and there were the clear tan lines of\
  \ a bracelet and a ring around the wrist and fourth finger of the right hand. Nothing\
  \ else about the person bore the kind of dazed, hungry demeanor of a cultist of\
  \ the Skinsaw Man. Quinn sized up the man’s muscular build, sun-worn skin, and the\
  \ pair of ornate anchor tattoos on each bicep—one in the Taldan or Andoren style\
  \ he would expect of a citizen of Augustana, the other similar but with flourishes\
  \ that appeared more Garundi, possibly Rahadoumi. This man must have been a sailor.\
  \ This expanded his investigation quite a bit, and he sighed at the notion.</p>\n\
  \              <p>He endeavored to ask his questions in the morning, then. Sailors\
  \ tend to be their most volatile at night.</p>\n              <p>At first light,\
  \ Quinn awoke and took a moment to consider what he knew so far about the victims.\
  \ The Skinsaw Cult garb was a ruse—but whose? Did a cultist find enough forethought\
  \ to hide their latest body in their own robes? It was doubtful compared to the\
  \ alternative: someone attempted to infiltrate the cult. It was highly unlikely\
  \ that they were on the same path that he himself was. Still, what the poor soul\
  \ may have found might be relevant, he thought. He hoped that the man may have shared\
  \ some part of his plan with a crewmate.</p>\n              <p>Yes, he knew that\
  \ would mean forcing the answers out of a sailor, the bulk of whom Quinn’s experience\
  \ told him would be loyal to their oaths of secrecy, even those sworn to the dead.\
  \ It’d be hard going, but at least there would be someone with answers.</p>\n  \
  \            <p>Quinn spent the morning combing the Fleet District, listening and\
  \ watching for any indication of what ship last night’s victim may have served on.\
  \ If his theory were correct, if the victim truly was tracking the cult across the\
  \ northern coast of the Inner Sea, then it’d be a ship recently arrived from Almas,\
  \ after having put in at both Oppara and Cassomir, though not in that order. That\
  \ narrowed the possible number of vessels to four.</p>\n              <p>It was\
  \ early afternoon before he’d further winnowed the possibilities to a single ship,\
  \ Oasis, which employed a Taldan crew but called Azir, Rahadoum’s so-called Port\
  \ Godless, her home port. Oasis had arrived just two nights hence, and its crew\
  \ were holed up in one of the sailor’s flophouses not far from the scene of the\
  \ crime. When he found the home, Quinn lifted the head of his cane and rapped on\
  \ the door three times with rhythmic precision, with the force of conviction but\
  \ not malice. Just as he drew breath to call out his name and intention, the door\
  \ slowly creaked open, and the stern face of a blond man in his forties glared at\
  \ him. “What can I do for you, friend?”</p>\n              <p>“I may have a bit\
  \ more to offer,” Quinn replied, smiling. “But first, do you know a tan-skinned\
  \ man, around your height and build, maybe a bit younger, darker of hair, with twin\
  \ anchor tattoos on the arms, of a kind but likely done by different needles in\
  \ ports far from one another?”</p>\n              <p>“Er… I mean, I know lots of\
  \ guys,” the man started, his eyes darting quickly from Quinn’s face to the head\
  \ of his cane and back. “Why?” Quinn noticed that the man didn’t inhale at the end\
  \ of the inquiry, nervously, subconsciously holding his breath.</p>\n          \
  \    <p>Surely you heard tell of the murder last night, the ritual killing? I have\
  \ reason to believe someone who’d been bunking here with the other members of his\
  \ crew was involved.” Quinn drew his journal from a coat pocket now, making a show\
  \ of checking it for the ship’s name. “Yes, the victim was most assuredly a sailor\
  \ on the Oasis—strange name for a ship, no? You know it?”</p>\n              <p>“\
  Victim?” the man said somberly, releasing his held breath and letting the door swing\
  \ open wide enough for Quinn to enter. “Jassa, one of my mates…” His eyes opened\
  \ wide, as if he were searching the floor between them both for something to make\
  \ sense of his sudden grief. “I’m bosun of Oasis. I can’t imagine why Jassa’d be\
  \ a target of a slaying that brutal. If what I heard is true, course.” When he finally\
  \ found himself, he put his hand out to greet the detective. “Randall. Thank you\
  \ for letting me know.”</p>\n              <p>Quinn shook the man’s hand firmly.\
  \ There was the formality Quinn expected, the apprehension against opening up to\
  \ anyone—especially non-sailors—who seemed to know more about a given situation.\
  \ Experience told him that he just had to push a few buttons first. “Why would a\
  \ man serving on a ship out of Azir be involved with religious zealots, cultists?”\
  </p>\n              <p>“Cultists? You think one of those flesh-peeling Skinsaws\
  \ did that to him?” Randall’s eyes flared with rage, but he caught himself suddenly.</p>\n\
  \              <p>There it was. Quinn had him now. “He told you something.”</p>\n\
  \              <p>“Like what, sir?”</p>\n              <p>“You didn’t even hesitate.\
  \ Jumped straight from ‘cultist’ to ‘Skinsaws’. Your man Jassa was looking into\
  \ something, and he let you know what. So now you’re going to tell me.” He walked\
  \ past the man and toward the corner of the room that served as a kitchen and continued.\
  \ “So, how do you like your tea?”</p>\n              <p>“… tea? What are you on\
  \ about, man?”</p>\n              <p>Quinn peered into a kettle to ensure its cleanliness\
  \ and began filling it with water, then turned to Randall and smirked. “When someone’\
  s about to tell me a long story, I like to have something to drink.”</p>\n     \
