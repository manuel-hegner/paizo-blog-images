  \     </div> \n     <br> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Hey folks! My name is\
  \ James L. Sutter—you might remember me as Starfinder's first Creative Director.\
  \ Though I've been away for a bit, exploring new worlds, I was absolutely thrilled\
  \ to return as the writer for the first-ever Starfinder comic series from Paizo\
  \ and Dynamite!</p> \n     <p>Back when we were first dreaming up Starfinder, we\
  \ knew we needed some sort of faster-than-light travel, but we wanted something\
  \ that felt unique—not just another Star Trek-style warp or Star Wars-style hyperspace.\
  \ I'd personally always been a fan of <em>Event Horizon</em>'s \"ship drive tears\
  \ open a hole to Hell\" idea, which seemed like it would present a lot of opportunity\
  \ for adventure. At the same time, games like Pathfinder and D&amp;D had already\
  \ long established that plane-hopping through the realms of the afterlife is a great\
  \ way to shortcut across vast distances on the Material Plane. So we thought: what\
  \ if instead of traveling by planeshifting to somewhere like Heaven or Hell, you\
  \ instead entered a whole <em>new </em>dimension, one dedicated to (or created by)\
  \ faster-than-light travel? And what if every time you did, it tore off a little\
  \ piece of one of the other planes to add to itself—making the dimension both hugely\
  \ useful and a parasitic cancer on reality?</p> \n     <p>Thus was the Drift born,\
  \ and with it one of the most recognizable and mysterious elements of our game's\
  \ setting. We'd known from early on that we wanted Starfinder's \"modern day\" to\
  \ be shortly after the discovery of faster-than-light travel: the beginning of a\
  \ galactic land rush, complete with all the excitement, conflict, and moral quandary\
  \ of an age of exploration. And the question of how Drift technology was created\
  \ let us build up canon around an important new deity: Triune the All-Code, god\
  \ of machines. We decided that the discovery would come from Triune sending out\
  \ \"the Signal,\" a magical message in a million different forms telling the cultures\
  \ receiving it how to construct ships capable of accessing the Drift.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>The Drift is crucial to every element of galactic society, from trade to basic\
  \ communication—which makes any threat to it unbelievably dangerous. <em>Starfinder:\
  \ Angels of the Drift</em> takes place during just such a threat: an event called\
  \ the Drift Crisis, in which the Drift suddenly begins behaving unpredictably, shunting\
  \ starships out in random locations or swallowing them whole. When our story begins,\
  \ Navasi and her crew have been having a hard time finding passengers willing to\
  \ brave an unstable dimension—until a spectra, a magical robot-like being native\
  \ to the Drift, hires them to help it take the Signal to an advanced culture that\
  \ somehow missed the message. But a new world comes with new opportunities for exploitation,\
  \ and our heroes aren't the only ones eager to make contact...</p> \n     <p>Of\
  \ course, a story is more than just its setting. While I've written for the Pathfinder\
  \ comics before—series like <em>Runescars</em>, <em>Hollow Mountain</em>, <em>Origins</em>,\
  \ and Goblins—with Starfinder, I knew I wanted to take a different approach. You\
  \ see, in June I'm coming out with my first young adult novel, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61885069-darkhearts\"\
  >Darkhearts</a>, a queer romance all about falling for the boy who stole your chance\
  \ at rock stardom. And while the Starfinder comics aren't a romance (yet), I learned\
  \ some lessons writing that book that I'll be bringing to Starfinder's epic science-fantasy\
  \ action. </p> \n     <p>The most important of those is that stories are about <em>characters</em>—\
  and that goes double for comics. After all, we don't return to the X-Men month after\
  \ month for the plots; we do it because we want to see Wolverine be our Grumpy Mutant\
  \ Dad, or watch a charismatic Magneto make some uncomfortably good points. And a\
  \ character is more than just a costume or a role in a party—they're their problems,\
  \ their relationships, their point of view. </p> \n     <p>So when I sat down to\
  \ outline <em>Starfinder: Angels of the Drift</em>, I made sure that every character\
  \ had some emotional or philosophical issue they were wrestling with—a challenge\
  \ to their worldview that could let them grow (or not). Without spoiling where everyone\
  \ ends up, below is a brief introduction to the party members and how they'll be\
  \ pushed emotionally over the course of the story.</p> \n     <p><b>Obozaya:</b>\
  \ Our brash vesk brawler is obsessed with two things: honor and dance music. While\
  \ Obo's never been one to walk away from a fight, this series will force her to\
  \ ask whether there's anything more important than being the best—and if violence\
  \ is always the answer.</p> \n     <p><b>Navasi:</b> As self-proclaimed shot-caller\
  \ for her merry band of mercenaries, Navasi's used to using quick wits and fast\
  \ talk to keep her party in food and fuel. Times are tough, and she knows their\
  \ vagabond life depends on her ability to cut a deal—but how much can a reformed\
  \ pirate squeeze the needy before she's no longer reformed?</p> \n     <p><b>Ciravel:</b>\
  \ As a precog, Ciravel sees glimpses of the future, and uses them to help lead her\
  \ friends—and the galaxy—down the best possible timeline. But how can she allow\
  \ others to make their own choices when she can already see the outcomes? Is freedom\
  \ really a virtue?</p> \n     <p><b>Quig:</b> Nobody can match Quig's ability as\
  \ a mechanic—or at least, that's what he thinks until he's forced to work with a\
  \ spectra who can simply ask machines to fix themselves. With his role in the party\
  \ in question, can our hotheaded, hard-partying rat cope with becoming obsolete?\
  \ </p> \n     <p><b>Keskodai:</b> For a shirren like Keskodai, individual choice\
  \ is everything—the divine gift that distinguishes them from the mindless, ravenous\
  \ Swarm. It's why he carries his son, Chk Chk, in a cradle-jar on his belt, so the\
  \ larva can see the galaxy and decide his own place in it. But when the bullets\
  \ start flying, everyone's favorite death priest will have to ask himself whether\
  \ putting his child at risk is really a responsible choice. </p> \n     <p>Thanks\
  \ so much for reading, and I hope you'll check out <em>Starfinder: Angels of the\
  \ Drift!</em></p> \n     <br> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/80fcfb31-bb9c-4cd7-83b6-583439b44503/SFComicInterior_01.jpg\"\
