  \   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">As we\
  \ enter the dark winter of Pathfinder Society's Year of the Risen Rune, campaign\
  \ HQ is already thinking ahead to the warming months of spring that still seem so\
  \ distant. Just last week, I assigned scenarios for April, and we're in the process\
  \ of outlining and approving the May scenarios to be commissioned in the coming\
  \ weeks. Since the season's endgame is quickly being decided, I thought it might\
  \ be a good time to give folks a little preview of where the season is set to go\
  \ from here, what challenges Pathfinders are bound to face, and what changes look\
  \ likely based on our reporting data.</span></p> \n    <p>What follows includes\
  \ spoilers for the remainder of the season, so if you don't like knowing anything\
  \ until your PC busts down the door, the rest of this blog might not be for you.\
  \ Fair warning and all that.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\

  \ of the Risen Rune metaplot, and PCs who've been through either <a href=\"/products/btpy8u8u\"\
  ><i>The Cultist's Kiss</i></a> or <a href=\"/products/btpy8u8w\"><i>Feast of Sigils</i></a>\
  \ already know that the stage is set for the season to end with a confrontation\
  \ with a waking runelord, and that's exactly what's going to happen. Over the next\
  \ few months, the Pathfinder Society will race with the cult of Lissala to uncover\
  \ the components needed to bring a runelord back from his millennial slumber, and\
  \ members of all factions are going to need to work together to prevent this terrible\
  \ evil from returning to the world.</p> \n    <p>Later this month, a prominent faction\
  \ head is going to need the entire society's help, and characters from 1st to 9th\
  \ levels will be able to assist in tracking the missing NPC down and ultimately\
  \ deciding if he or she is rescued from certain death or written out of the campaign.\
  \ We'll be looking very closely at the early reporting data from <a href=\"/products/btpy8v0j\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Society Scenario #4â€“13: Fortress of the Nail</i></a> as a result,\
  \ and the sooner you play that scenario, the more likely your actions will be to\
  \ directly affect the campaign world.</p> \n    <p>Along similar lines, judging\
  \ by reported data since Gen Con, it looks like two factions are in serious jeopardy\
  \ of being written out of the campaign. We've known for some time that several factions\
  \ were struggling, but looking at play results over the last few months means that\
  \ some major changes may be coming. We've only got another month or two before any\
  \ faction-eliminating scenarios would need to be written, so there's not much longer\
  \ for folks to turn things around for their ailing factions. I recommend playing\
  \ often and doing your best to accomplish both your primary and secondary missions\
  \ with characters of your favorite factions in the next two months. Because after\
  \ we change course to reflect a faction's failures or successes, we won't be able\
  \ to go back and change things.</p> \n    <p>Sometime next month, look for another\
  \ letter from each of the faction heads to report on their respective factions'\
  \ successes and failures thus far in the season, and to get an idea of whether or\
  \ not your favorite faction might be in desperate need of help. If you didn't receive\
  \ the last faction goal email over the summer, make sure to set your privacy settings\
  \ to accept non-transactional emails from Paizo so you don't miss the next one.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>With the holidays coming up, it's likely many people will be traveling\
  \ to see family or staying home to enjoy some much needed time off from work. In\
  \ either case, there's a Pathfinder Society game happening close to wherever you'll\
  \ be, so make sure to check the Pathfinder Society events page to find a game between\
  \ fruitcakes and egg nog. And hope Santa gives you lots of natural 20s when you're\
  \ playing.</p> \n    <p>Mark Moreland<br> <i>Developer</i></p> \n    <p>P.S. Some\
  \ folks on the messageboards requested we show off some NPC headshot art here so\
  \ they can make handouts with them and share them under the Community Use Policy.\
  \ That's what the art is from/for. Merry Christmas!</p> \n   </div> \n  </blockquote>\
