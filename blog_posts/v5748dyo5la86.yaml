  \   </div> \n   <blockquote> \n    <h1>Presenting the Gen Con 2009 Scenarios!</h1>\
  \ \n    <p class=\"date\">Thursday, March 19, 2009</p> \n    <p>I've spent a huge\
  \ portion of this week thinking about and planning for Gen Con 2009. As most of\
  \ you know, we're launching the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game at Gen Con, which means\
  \ we're also kicking off Season 1 of Pathfinder Society Organized Play. The first\
  \ slot of the show, Thursday morning, will be a character creation/conversion seminar\
  \ with Paizo employees and volunteer GMs who have all seen the rules ahead of time\
  \ and will be available to answer questions and help you either build a new character\
  \ or follow our soon-to-be-released conversion guidelines for Season 1. We'll cut\
  \ everyone loose before the dealer hall opens so they can hop in what will assuredly\
  \ be a long line for the RPG hardcover itself and then let everyone flow back to\
  \ the Org Play area to finish their characters alongside their shiny new (possibly\
  \ autographed) Pathfinder Roleplaying Game books.</p> \n    <p>The real fun kicks\
  \ off Thursday afternoon when we launch Season 1 of Pathfinder Society Organized\
  \ Play! We have four outstanding scenarios written by four outstanding scenario\
  \ authors (if I do say so myself) who will all be in attendance at Gen Con and will\
  \ likely GM their own scenarios once or twice as surprise GMs throughout the show.\
  \ Tim Hitchcock and the Werecabbages are brewing a brilliant Friday and Saturday\
  \ night interactive event for the Pathfinder Society that I cannot reveal the details\
  \ about yet as the lycanthropic vegetable club would stake me and eat my brains\
  \ for doing so. Rest assured, when Tim pitched me the idea, I ran screaming through\
  \ the office declaring it the best idea since horseshoes.</p> \n    <p>Here are\
  \ some quick summaries of the four scenarios we'll be running at Gen Con 2009:</p>\
  \ \n    <p><b>Pathfinder Society Scenario 29</b>:<br> <i>The Devil We Know, Part\
  \ 1: Shipyard Rats</i> (Tiers 1–7) by Joshua J. Frost<br> When simultaneous kidnappings\
  \ of Pathfinder and Aspis Consortium agents rock Cassomir's imperial shipyards,\
  \ the Society orders you to join forces with hated Aspis agents to solve the mystery.\
  \ Can you work together with the enemies of the Society to uncover the source of\
  \ the kidnappings, or will you perish in the shipyards of Cassomir? Written for\
  \ the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game.</p> \n    <p><b>Pathfinder Society Scenario 30</b>:<br>\
  \ <i>The Devil We Know, Part 2: Cassomir's Locker</i> (Tiers 1–7) by Joshua J. Frost<br>\
  \ The Pathfinder Society dispatches you into the catacombs beneath the shipyards\
  \ known as Cassomir's Locker to uncover the source of a shamanistic rat cult that's\
  \ breeding monstrous vermin never before seen on Golarion. After thwarting a double-cross\
  \ and delving into the dirty dungeons below, will you find the artifact that powers\
  \ Cassomir's Locker in time or will you bring about the destruction of Taldor's\
  \ most important port? Written for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game.</p> \n    <p><b>Pathfinder\
  \ Society Scenario 31</b>:<br> <i>Sniper in the Deep</i> (Tiers 5–9) by David Eitelbach\
  \ &amp; Hank Woon<br> When rumors stir of a hidden treasure ship in Absalom's Flotsam\
  \ Graveyard, the Pathfinder Society sends you beneath the Inner Sea to investigate.\
  \ Mayhem, undersea adventure, and chaos are to be had in this rousing rampage beneath\
  \ the roiling waters of Absalom's harbor. Written for the Pathfinder Roleplaying\
  \ Game.</p> \n    <p><b>Pathfinder Society Scenario 32</b>:<br> <i>Drow of the Darklands\
  \ Pyramid</i> (Tiers 7–11) by Sean K Reynolds<br> A rogue band of drow are plaguing\
  \ the artifact shipping lanes of Osirion and the Pathfinder Society has sent you\
  \ to stop them. When the drow capture an entire caravan laden with Society relics,\
  \ the Decemvirate orders you into the Darklands to track down the drow and their\
  \ stolen cargo. You'll travel beneath Golarion, fighting through caverns of hideous\
  \ creatures to reach the fabled Darklands Pyramid—will your survive the journey,\
  \ or become a slave forever? Written for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Lastly, I want to congratulate the selectees for the final 3.5 Pathfinder\
  \ Society Organized Play Open Call: Elizabeth Leib and James MacKenzie! They're\
  \ writing #28 <i>Lyrics of Extinction</i> and #27 <i>Our Lady of Silver</i> respectively.\
  \ Congratulations!</p> \n    <p>Joshua J. Frost <br>Events Manager</p> \n   </blockquote>\
