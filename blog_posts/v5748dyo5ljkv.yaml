  \ Story So Far</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, February 28, 2017</p> \n   <p>We\
  \ are officially halfway through the <a href=\"/pfsacg/products/season3\">Season\
  \ of Plundered Tombs</a>!</p> \n   <p itemprop=\"description\">Brave Pathfinder\
  \ Agents have investigated lost tombs, translated hidden runes, smashed undead guardians,\
  \ and dispersed elementals, all in service to the Pathfinder Society. There may\
  \ have been some amount of plundering also happening, based on the fine historic\
  \ artifacts exhibited by those agents, but that is clearly secondary to the far\
  \ more altruistic pursuit of knowledge.</p> \n   <p><b>BEWARE</b>: Spoilers Ahead.\
  \ You were warned.</p> \n   <h2><a href=\"/products/btpy9pt3?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Guild-Adventure-31-Serpents-in-the-Deep\"\
  >Adventure 1: Serpents in the Deep</a></h2> \n   <p>First, you earned the appreciation\
  \ of many local merchants by ridding the world of a tribe of Gnoll bandits. You\
  \ then snuck into the Aspis Consortium's dig site to appropriate their research.\
  \ Unfortunately, you weren't the only person with this idea. You were soon hot in\
  \ pursuit of a Taldan spy. That pursuit led you to dive into the underwater ruin\
  \ of Shotep-Kara. There, a doru div turned the city's constructs and elemental wards\
  \ against you. Eventually, you overcame all obstacles, defeated the Taldan (twice!),\
  \ and recovered a set of ancient tablets. The tablets proved to be a map to an ancient\
  \ pyramid capable of flight. Possession of such a sky pyramid could greatly assist\
  \ the Pathfinder Society. It slipping into the wrong hands might give enough power\
  \ to terrorize thousands and destabilize nations.</p> \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \    <p>Fantastic archaeological wonder or best Pathfinder Lodge ever?</p> \n  \
  \ </div> \n   <h2><a href=\"/products/btpy9qcz?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Guild-Adventure-32-Secrets-Below-the-Sands\"\
  >Adventure 2: Secrets Below the Sands</a></h2> \n   <p>Outnumbered and outmaneuvered\
  \ by the Aspis Consortium, you had no choice but to work with them on locating the\
  \ pyramid. You put together an expedition, despite the best efforts of a number\
  \ of thieves, and set out into the desert. There, you were not so gently greeted\
  \ by quicksand and pairaka divs. You then rescued elementals from enslavement by\
  \ undead and used their help to excavate the buried pyramid. Inside the pyramid,\
  \ you carefully worked past its traps and defenders to discover its secrets. Alas,\
  \ your alliance with the Aspis Consortium then came to a crashing end and you were\
  \ forced to flee the pyramid.</p> \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    <a href=\"\

  ></a> \n    <p>The Aspis sure were useful when they weren't trying to kill you...</p>\
  \ \n   </div> \n   <h2><a href=\"/products/btpy9qn6?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Guild-Adventure-33-In-Search-of-a-Sage\"\
  >Adventure 3: In Search of a Sage</a></h2> \n   <p>With the pyramid seized by the\
  \ traitorous Aspis Consortium, you realized you were going to need some assistanceâ€”\
  specifically, the kind of assistance only an ancient Jeweled Sage can give. You\
  \ searched the forgotten (and very trapped) stacks of the sages' stronghold and\
  \ set out on the trail of the Spinel Sage, Mnesoset. In Katapesh, you ran into and\
  \ promptly removed some more gnoll brigands, then bargained with Grandmaster Torch,\
  \ an infamous information broker. With his advice, you allied with the alchemists\
  \ of the Hidden Flame to follow the sage's trail past lamias and summoned sandstorms\
  \ to a Thriae Hive. At the hive, you made a fateful decision to assist either your\
  \ new alchemist friends or their thriae victims.</p> \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderAdventurePath/PZO9083-Bestiary_500.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n    <p>Those sandstorms sure packed a punch.</p> \n   </div> \n   <h2><a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy9r83?Pathfinder-Society-Adventure-Card-Guild-Adventure-34-Tomb-of-the-Godless-Host\"\
  >Adventure 4: Tomb of the Godless Host</a></h2> \n   <p>Now, the fourth adventure\
  \ in this path kicks off at full speed, with a PACG <a href=\" /prd/gameMasteryGuide/chases.html#chases\"\
  >chase</a> to escape the Rahadoum Pure Legion. From there, you'll get to tangle\
  \ with divs (yet again) and Jistkan constructs of all kinds in your quest to find\
  \ the Spinel Sage.</p> \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderCampaignSetting/PZO9246-BehemothGolem.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderCampaignSetting/PZO9246-BehemothGolem_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n    <p>Those Jistkans really made some amazing golems. I'm sure this one's\
  \ friendly, too.</p> \n   </div> \n   <p>Plus, you might finally learn something\
  \ about that <a href=\"/threads/rzs2u58j?Mummys-Mask-Puzzle-Discussion\">Mythopoeic\
  \ Sphinx</a> you've been wondering about. Maybe not <i>everything</i>, but something.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>After that, it's just a hop, skip, and a jump to reclaiming the flying\
  \ pyramid the Aspis Consortium stole from you. Smooth sailing from here on out.\
