  /companies/ritePublishing\">Rite Publishing</a>, was one of the first third-party\
  \ publishers to give his support for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, but his impact\
  \ goes well beyond the hundreds of products he helped usher into creation for gamers\
  \ everywhere. Many of Paizo's freelancers got their start with Rite Publishing,\
  \ and more than a few of us that work at Paizo also had the pleasure of working\
  \ with him. Friend, advisor, mentor, author, designerâ€”he wore all of these titles\
  \ proudly. But none were as proudly worn as \"gamer.\"</p> \n    <p>He was One of\
  \ Us, and his influence and passion for the hobby will be missed.</p> \n    <p>A\
