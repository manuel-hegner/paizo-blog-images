  >Gen Con 2013: News and Official Call for Volunteers</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\"\

  \ itemprop=\"description\">For Gen Con 2012, I advised last year that we planned\
  \ to make it the biggest and best Gen Con yet. And it certainly was. We scheduled\
  \ 750 tables of Pathfinder Society over the four days. We showed the world our GM\
  \ 101 workshops, Kids' Track, and Beginner Box Introductions. Gen Con was definitely\
  \ a success and Paizo's biggest showing in history. But we can make it better!</span></p>\
  \ \n    <p>As many already know, <a href=\"/paizo/news/v5748eaic9q7w\">Paizo stepped\
  \ up as a cosponsor at this year's show</a>. What does that mean for Pathfinder\
  \ Society? It means we move into the Sagamore Ballroom! We double in size, scheduling\
  \ 150 tables per slot. Additionally, we also have two of the seven rooms that were\
  \ used for Pathfinder Society last year. One of them will be used exclusively for\
  \ Paizo seminars. The other room will have 10 tables and a mini-HQ that will allow\
  \ us to schedule five tables of Beginner Box Introductions and five tables of the\
  \ Kids' Track for all ten slots of Gen Con. This year, we will also be hosting a\
  \ GM and volunteer briefing in the Sagamore Ballroom from 5-6 pm on Wednesday. If\
  \ you are a volunteer of GM, please try to attend.</p> \n    <p>Doubling in size\
  \ allows us to offer a much broader selection of scenarios for players to choose\
  \ from. I also wanted this to serve as a celebration of Pathfinder Society history\
  \ and have chosen several multipart series, as well as favorites from past seasons,\
  \ in addition to the normal offerings of the previous season and the new season.\
  \ We are planning to schedule 61 different scenarios, one Gen Con Special, two Gen\
  \ Con Exclusives, and two modules! These include seven Season 0 scenarios, nine\
  \ Season 1 scenarios, 13 Season 2 scenarios, 10 Season 3 scenarios, 19 Season 4\
  \ scenarios, and four Season 5 scenarios. We are also offereing a few tables of\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy8j5w\"><i>We Be Goblins!</i></a> and <a href=\"/products/btpy8wvm\"\
  ><i>We Be Goblins Too!</i></a> throughout the course of the convention.</p> \n \
  \   <p>We are planning one or two tables of the three new Season 5 scenarios for\
  \ each morning and afternoon slot throughout the convention, which will be GMed\
  \ in French and Spanish languages. Paris Venture-Captain Karim Majeri, Quebec Venture-Captain\
  \ Michel Lepage, and French GM Florent Fournol will be traveling to Gen Con from\
  \ their countries and GMing a large share of the French-language tables, but I still\
  \ have a few open tables if you are fluent in French. Every French-language GM that\
  \ volunteers to GM six or more tables will receive a French-language <i>Core Rulebook</i>\
  \ as a thank you! All of the Spanish-language tables need GMs. If you are fluent\
  \ in either language, please consider GMing in some of these first time offerings\
  \ at Gen Con.</p> \n    <p>The Season 5 Gen Con special, <i>Siege of the Diamond\
  \ City</i>, scheduled for Friday night, will help us kickoff the new season near\
  \ the Worldwound! The Special this year will be designed for levels 1—15, and include\
  \ subtiers for levels 12—13 and 14—15. At 150 tables, it will be one of the single\
  \ largest, collaborative roleplaying games ever hosted!</p> \n    <br> \n    <div\

  \ will be offering two exclusives this year at Gen Con, one on Thursday night and\
  \ one on Saturday night. On Thursday evening, we'll be running a particularly challenging\
  \ (and lethal) Tier 3—7 scenario, the <i>Ruins of Bonekeep, Level 1: The Silent\
  \ Grave</i>, written by Jason Bulhman, Lead Designer at Paizo Publishing. This is\
  \ the first of a series of special events designed to test your character to its\
  \ limits. It debuted at Winter Fantasy this past January and will make a few limited\
  \ appearances throughout the spring and summer convention season leading up to Gen\
  \ Con. On Saturday night, we will follow up <i>Ruins of Bonekeep, Level 1</i> with\
  \ <i>Ruins of Bonekeep, Level 2</i>, also written by Jason. It is also being designed\
  \ for Tier 3—7 characters, and again, will be particularly challenging and lethal.\
  \ <i>Ruins of Bonekeep, Level 2</i> will make its debut at Gen Con. For both of\
  \ the exclusives, the threat of character death is very real, but the potential\
  \ rewards are greater as a result. You will be able to, as a table, decide to leave\
  \ the event at any time should it become too deadly for you, except when engaged\
  \ in combat. If this is not the type of event for you, please look for other options\
  \ during Slots 3 and 9. We will only run each level one time at Gen Con so both\
  \ will be limited, exclusive events. On a side note, we will have a few limited\
  \ tables running all three of the new Season 5 scenarios if you would rather not\
  \ participate in either of the exclusives.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\">\n\

  \ the Pathfinder RPG Beginner Box Introductions, we have two different offerings\
  \ this year. During all 10 slots at Gen Con, we are setting aside five tables during\
  \ each slot for these Beginner Box Introduction events. Both parts are scheduled\
  \ with new players in mind. For Beginner Box Introductions, Part 1, it is the same\
  \ as last year in that we will allow for the first 45—60 minutes to be an exploration\
  \ of the contents of the <a href=\"/beginnerbox\"><i>Pathfinder RPG Beginner Box</i></a>,\
  \ explaining the rules, and reviewing the pregenerated characters. The final four\
  \ hours of each slot will be playing through the four, one-hour adventures that\
  \ were offered last year. For Beginner Box Introductions, Part 2, the GM will assist\
  \ players in advancing their character to 3rd level. The <a href=\"/products/btpy8uqm\"\
  ><i>Beginner Box Transitions</i></a>, <a href=\"/products/btpy8p2k\"><i>Player Pack</i></a>,\
  \ and <a href=\"/products/btpy8p2l\"><i>GM Kit</i></a> will be reviewed. Once those\
  \ three free documents have been covered, we will be offering up five brand-new,\
  \ one-hour adventures as time permits. Much like the four adventures in Part 1,\
  \ these will be utilizing only the <i>Beginner Box</i> rules.</p> \n    <p>We'll\
  \ also be expanding the <a href=\"/products/btpy8vq8\">Pathfinder Kids' Track</a>\
  \ this year! We will be setting aside five tables at each slot for all 10 slots\
  \ of the convention. We are focusing on players aged 6—12 and we will be using the\
  \ <i>Pathfinder RPG Beginner Box</i> for this as well. The Kids' Track is divided\
  \ into two parts—the Beginner Track and the Advanced Track. Each kids' Beginner\
  \ Track slot will be two hours long and each player will receive a check-off card,\
  \ similar to what was used last year and at the Beginner Box Bash in 2011. The first\
  \ hour of each of the 10 kids' Beginner Track sessions teaches roleplaying and rules,\
  \ and reviews the pregenerated characters found in the <i>Pathfinder RPG Beginner\
  \ Box</i>. During the second hour, <a href=\"/products/btpy8q4o\">one of the four,\
  \ one-hour adventures used during the Beginner Box Bash</a> will be played.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>For the kids' Advanced Track, we are focusing on children who participated\
  \ in last year's kids' Beginner Track, at a local kids' Beginner Track session near\
  \ their home, or for older children that have prior experience with Pathfinder Roleplaying\
  \ Game. The GM at each of the two-hour slots will help the children level-up their\
  \ chosen character to third level. After leveling is complete, the GM will run one\
  \ of five new adventures designed using the <i>Beginner Box</i> rules.</p> \n  \
  \  <p>We will be running each of the nine different adventures multiple times throughout\
  \ the convention to allow flexible scheduling for children and parents. We will\
  \ be restricting tables to four children players and are requiring a parent or guardian\
  \ be present with the child (or multiple children if two or more are interested\
  \ in participating) for the entire two hours. The parent or guardian will assist\
  \ the child when needed. We want to make this a good and memorable experience for\
  \ the kids that attend Gen Con, who often find little they can participate in, especially\
  \ with others their own age. We will be scheduling 30, two-hour tables per day on\
  \ Thursday through Saturday, and 20, two-hour tables on Sunday, for the Kids' Track,\
  \ divided between the Beginner Track and Advanced Track.</p> \n    <p>If a child\
  \ plays all four different adventures in the Beginner Track, he will be able to\
  \ present his check-off card to HQ and receive a special certificate that celebrates\
  \ his accomplishments. If a child plays all five different adventures in the Advanced\
  \ Track, she will be able to present her check-off card to HQ and receive a second,\
  \ different special certificate. Each of the certificates has a different boon that\
  \ can be applied to a new Pathfinder Society character if the child finishes both\
  \ Kids' Tracks and wants to advance from the <i>Beginner Box</i> and participate\
  \ in Pathfinder Society Organized Play. We may also have other giveaways or special\
  \ prizes, such as dice and minaitures, similar to last year. <b>I will be very picky\
  \ when choosing volunteer GMs for the Kids' Track.</b> I prefer to have school teachers\
  \ and other professionals with experience dealing with children. I will consider\
  \ GMs who are parents even if they do not deal with children regularly in their\
  \ profession. If you are volunteering to GM the Kids' Track, please make sure to\
  \ include all of your credentials. Also, since these are scheduled as two-hour blocks,\
  \ a GM will be required to run two Kids' Track slots back to back in a four-hour\
  \ block to count as 1 slot of credit toward GM rewards.</p> \n    <p>We are bringing\
  \ back <a href=\"/products/btpy8vq7\">GM 101</a> in both of its parts—the breakout\
  \ sessions and the Deck of Many Situations. In addition to GM 101, we will be showing\
  \ off GM 201, which will debut at PaizoCon and build on the lessons learned from\
  \ the GM 101 course. On a side note, the last draft I saw circulating around the\
  \ office had 22 other seminars scheduled besides just the two GM classes!</p> \n\
  \    <p>Finally, I need volunteers who have experience with the Pathfinder Adventure\
  \ Card Game (“Project Swallowtail”) playtest to run demos in the Dealer Hall next\
  \ to Paizo's booth. You can volunteer to work one or two five-hour blocks each day\
  \ from 9 AM to 6 PM (Sunday ends at 4 PM). Volunteering for any demo time will count\
  \ toward your GM reward credit below.</p> \n    <p>Now, let's talk about the GMs\
  \ and volunteers we need to pull all of the above off and make it the biggest and\
  \ best Gen Con ever.</p> \n    <p>I need a minimum of 300 volunteer GMs for Pathfinder\
  \ Society games, Beginner Box Introductions, Kids' Track events, GM 101 and 201,\
  \ and Pathfinder Adventure Card Game demos. I'll continue taking volunteer GMs until\
  \ the slots are filled, at which point I will create a waiting list in the event\
  \ that a scheduled GM has to cancel their Gen Con trip for whatever reason. I also\
  \ need a few Volunteer Assistants for each slot of the show. These folks will not\
  \ GM during their volunteer slots, but will instead help me run Pathfinder Society\
  \ HQ, including marshaling, collecting tickets, distributing GM packs, entering\
  \ tracking sheets into the database, and they will be our go-to guys and gals for\
  \ all things Pathfinder Society. Keep in mind these positions are very limited and\
  \ likely to fill up in the first few hours after the blog goes live.</p> \n    <p>Below\
  \ you will find the reward structure for volunteering at Gen Con 2013. Keep in mind\
  \ that you're volunteering for slots, not a specific event. You can request a special\
  \ event if you like, but it will not be guaranteed. Those who are able to spice\
  \ up their event by adding 3D terrain, props that stand out, and the like will be\
  \ given first consideration for specific events. I will let you know the slots and\
  \ scenarios you have been assigned as soon as possible. You may designate what tier\
  \ of scenarios you wish to GM but fulfilling this request is not guaranteed. I will,\
  \ however, do the best I can to accommodate your requests. My target date to have\
  \ all GMs their assigned schedules is <b>April 19</b>. This should allow you plenty\
  \ of time to plan a schedule, before the <b>May 19</b> event registration, with\
  \ your friends and family who are also attending Gen Con 2013. Please let me know\
  \ via email which days you will be at the convention and how many slots you are\
  \ volunteering for at Gen Con 2013.</p> \n    <p>When you email me, I need you to\
  \ include the following information in your email: </p>\n    <ol>\n     <li>The\
  \ email address that is tied to your Gen Con account.</li> \n     <li>The email\
  \ address that is tied to your Paizo.com account.</li> \n     <li>I need to know\
  \ if you have received the purple goblin Pathfinder Society volunteer shirts at\
  \ a previous show. If not, I need to know what size you wear.</li>\n    </ol> \n\

  \    <p>Again, please be specific about what days and how many slots you are volunteering\
  \ for. I will assign folks to slots and scenarios on an as-needed basis. I will\
  \ update the needs in the thread below as I receive volunteers, so you may look\
  \ there to remain up to date on where we still need help. You must have a gencon.com\
  \ account and you must include your email address tied to your Gen Con account in\
  \ your email or I won't be able to get you a badge (obviously this is only for volunteers\
  \ who are volunteering for 5 or more slots). Include the email address tied to your\
  \ Paizo.com account so I can make sure you receive the scenarios in your downloads.\
  \ Finally, I need to know if you have received the purple goblin Pathfinder Society\
  \ volunteer shirts in the past. If not, I need to know what size you need.</p> \n\
  \    <p>The time slots are as follows:</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><b>Slot\
  \ 1:</b> Thursday 8 AM to 1 PM<br> <b>Slot 2:</b> Thursday 1 PM to 6 PM<br> <b>Slot\
  \ 3:</b> Thursday 7 PM to Midnight (Gen Con Exclusive #1 and three new Season 5\
  \ scenarios)<br> <b>Slot 4:</b> Friday 8 AM to 1 PM<br> <b>Slot 5:</b> Friday 1\
  \ PM to 6 PM<br> <b>Slot 6:</b> Friday 7 PM to Midnight (Gen Con Special)<br> <b>Slot\

  \ 9:</b> Saturday 7 PM to Midnight (Gen Con Exclusive #2 and three new Season 5\
