  \ Stage</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Friday, September 4, 2009</p> \n    <p>In <a\
  \ href=\"/pathfinderAdventurePaths/councilOfThieves/v5748btpy87da\"><i>Pathfinder\
  \ #26</i></a>, we try something a little different. During the course of Richard\
  \ Pett's \"The Sixfold Trial\" the PCs find themselves involved in the diabolical\
  \ performance of a notorious play. It's a pretty neat idea that really gives the\
  \ PCs an opportunity to show their stuff off the battlefield and gives players with\
  \ a flair for the dramatic a real chance to shine. Yet rather than skim over this\
  \ focal point of the adventure with just a few hand waves and Perform checks, we\
  \ did something a little crazy.</p> \n    <p>We commissioned the text of the entire\
  \ play.</p> \n    <p>And we did it from theatrically-minded madman Nick Logue.</p>\
  \ \n    <p> What we got was <i>The Six Trials of Larazod</i>, a performance piece\
  \ for you to read, roleplay, act out, and include however you and your group pleases,\
  \ along with rules on how to integrate the work with (or exclude it from) the main\
  \ adventure. I'm proud to say it's one of the most appropriately avant-garde pieces\
  \ of game design I've ever seen. And it's headed your way in just a few weeks here.\
  \ But to tempt you with what's in store, here's the introduction to the first work\
  \ of literature to come to you directly from Golarion. Also, expect a very distinctive\
  \ look for the play from artist Sara Otterstätter, like the title piece you see\
  \ here.</p> \n    <p> <i>The Six Trials of Larazod</i> is the fictional account\
  \ of a Chelish tiefling named Larazod Rilsane. Larazod receives a vision from Asmodeus\
  \ in which the dark god unveils a prominent Chelish magistrate—the sinister Paraduke\
  \ Montigny Haanderthan—as a traitor to Cheliax, who has compacted with demonic powers\
  \ and plans to bring the worship of Asmodeus to a sharp and brutal end. Burning\
  \ with unholy justice and diabolical purpose, Larazod, along with his stalwart companions,\
  \ sets out to expose the highly placed traitor Haanderthan. They are greatly overmatched,\
  \ as Larazod is a minor scion of a piddling noble house whose influence lies tattered\
  \ in the wake of Thrune's seizure of power in Cheliax. Undaunted, Larazod vows a\
  \ smoldering blood oath to Asmodeus to see the traitor fall before Haanderthan's\
  \ actions bring the dark glory of Cheliax low.</p> \n    <p>So bone up on your Shakespeare\
  \ and get ready for rehearsals—tryouts for <i>The Six Trials of Larazod</i> are\
  \ just around the corner!</p> \n    <p>Wes Schneider<br>Managing Editor</p> <!--\
