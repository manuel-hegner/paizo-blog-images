  \ now, we wanted to take another look at the book and the authors who made it possible.\
  \ Much like the Knights of Lastwall put in the effort to further the cause of good,\
  \ these authors gave their all to create the latest exciting entry in the Lost Omens\
  \ line of books. As these authors share a bit about themselves and their work, consider\

  \    <p>Hi! I’m Banana and I had the privilege of working on a few of the deities,\
  \ specifically Iomedae, Pharasma, Ragathiel, and Sarenrae. I had such a great time\
  \ writing up the rituals involved for each deity, especially Pharasma’s. I’m a sucker\
  \ for any god of death and goth stuff. Aside from this book, my latest work has\
  \ been on <em>Suburban Consumption of the Monstrous</em>, <em>Exquisite Crime, Jiangshi:\
  \ Blood in the Banquet Hall</em>, <em>Van Richten’s Guide to Ravenloft</em> and\
  \ <em>Betrayal at House on the Hill 3rd Edition</em>. You can also find me on Twitter\

  \ Society Developer and a freelance author. For <em>Knights of Lastwall</em>, I\
  \ contributed Avalorex, the Knightly Training and Lastwall Sentry feats, the spells,\
  \ details on the Eye of Dread region, and—my personal favorite—entries on the gods\
  \ Arqueros, Kols, and Vildeis, and all the <em>avatar</em> stats. This book was\

  \ contributor to <em>Knights of Lastwall</em> and Director of Operations at the\
  \ Know Direction Network. Until recently, I was always up to my eyeballs in Pathfinder.\
  \ Now that I’ve stepped away from the Know Direction podcast, it’s more meaningful\
  \ to me when I get to participate in a Pathfinder project. And what a project! <em>Knights\
  \ of Lastwall</em> takes the classic imagery of chivalry and combines it with the\
  \ sensibilities, forward thinking, and creativity that makes the Lost Omens line\
  \ some of my favorite Pathfinder content ever.</p> \n      <p>I especially liked\
  \ working on the “Other Groups” article and exploring the Charcoal Battalion from\
  \ Oprak’s Ironfang Legion, the Final Epitaph philosophy of Pharasmin knights, the\
  \ orcs of the Rampart Warband, and my favorite¬¬: the undead hunting Eagle Knight\
  \ splinter group known as the Vulture Knights. By eating carrion, vultures play\
  \ an important role in disease containment in our ecosystem. Tying vultures to hunting\
  \ undead wrote itself, and I got to cast these vilified creatures as the noblest\
  \ of heroes. The section I worked on that will probably see the most play is the\
  \ “Knights of Lastwall Backgrounds” article. As my wonderful developer Luis put\
  \ it, you can tell I wrote this section by the wordplay. </p> \n      <p>You can\

  \ I am Alastor Guzman, your local Mexican game designer. I’m a freelance designer\
  \ and writer and have worked on several indie games and some bigger projects like\
  \ <em>Journeys Through the Radiant Citadel</em>. I was honored to be able to write\
  \ some of the factions in the “Other Groups” article as well as some magic items\
  \ for <em>Knights of Lastwall</em>. It was lots of fun designing new magic items\
  \ for a Pathfinder book, looking for the mix of utility, purpose, and awe in the\
  \ items that will see your table. I also enjoyed developing the groups and their\
  \ interrelationships in a way you can use in your games. </p> \n      <p>Besides\
  \ my work as a freelancer, I have also worked on smaller Mexican projects such as\
  \ the ENNIE-nominated <a href=\"https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/320918/The-Maze\"\
  ><em>The Maze</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/390489/Tezca-Sentai\"\
  ><em>Tezca Sentai</em></a>. I am currently working on new projects like a legendary\
  \ fight system for fantasy RPGs, and fantasy settings based on Mesoamerican mythology.\

  \ Roberts, and I loved bringing a little bit of love to this book by writing the\
  \ married knights Buttons and Fenn Tunwalker, along with the intro to the “Factions”\
  \ article, a few of the minor factions, and Milani, the Everbloom. While I had a\
  \ wonderful time writing all of it, creating a couple whose love for each other\
  \ and the knights they watch over is a source of strength during tumultuous times\
  \ was particularly meaningful for me, given *gestures at the world*.</p> \n    \
  \  <p>I’ve appeared around these parts in the past as part of <em>Pathfinder Lost\
  \ Omens Grand Bazaar</em> (everything is cake!) and in <em>Starfinder Bounty #3:\
  \ A Green Place</em>, and I have work coming up in <em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Travel\
  \ Guide</em> and <em>Starfinder Interstellar Species</em>. Follow me on Twitter\
  \ <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nirele\">@nirele</a> for more about those projects\
  \ and other fun things I’m working on!</p> \n      <br> \n      <h3>Ashton Sperry\
  \ (they/them)</h3> \n      <p>Howdy! It’s me, your nonbinary freelancer friend on\
  \ the internet! I wrote the entries on Khagrig Daybreak and Gendowyn in Chapter\
  \ 2, and the “Broken Lands” and “Other Campaigns” sections in Chapter 4 of <em>Knights\
  \ of Lastwall</em>. Every project I’ve been on has been a distinct honor and pleasure,\
  \ working hand-in-hand with my fellow authors as well as our developers to bring\
  \ this fine material to y’all. With my sections, I got to explore some of the more\
  \ unusual characters tied to the Knights, which I had a lot of fun doing; “How does\
  \ a Chaotic Neutral fey queen tie into the faiths of the knighthood?” and “How would\
  \ my knight character fit into a campaign set in Vudra?” were just some of the questions\
  \ I got to explore in my submissions for this fine tome. As always, you can find\
  \ me on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WhoTweetedThis\">@WhoTweetedThis</a>\
  \ where I talk about gaming stuff and post the occasional piece of art. Thank you\
  \ for your time, and I hope you enjoy <em>Knights of Lastwall</em>!</p> \n     \
  \ <br> \n      <h3>Isabelle Thorne</h3> \n      <p>Hallo everyone! I’m Isabelle\
  \ Thorne, trans girl and long-time Paizo contributor. I had a big hand in this one,\
  \ as you might guess from the cover! The Knights of Lastwall really are my baby;\
  \ I first developed them in the Pathfinder <em>Lost Omens Character Guide</em> and\
  \ followed through in <em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Legends</em> with the Iomedars,\
  \ all leading up to this. And they’re the first piece of Pathfinder I really got\
  \ to shape from the start. So, this is kind of a big moment for me!</p> \n     \
  \ <p>And there’s so much. In addition to most of the section intros and other bridges,\
  \ I contributed the in-depth looks at the Crimson Reclaimers and Shining Sentinels,\
  \ and the insight in “Life as a Knight of Lastwall.” I also got to show off some\
  \ of my NPCs from earlier books, like Beirivelle and Ileana (and Clarethe again!).\
  \ Additionally, I had the opportunity to explore deities through a knight’s eyes;\
  \ Kazutal, Falayna, Shelyn (finally!! I’m so happy), and our first look at the Vudrani\
  \ deity Suyuddha. Finally, I expanded on my knight vigilant and knight reclaimant,\
  \ plus feats for other archetypes.</p> \n      <p>Beyond this momentous occasion,\
  \ I’m expanding into freelance editing and fiction; you’ll get to see some of that\
  \ in <em>Queerfinder</em> on Pathfinder Infinite and the recently crowdfunded <em>Sinclair’\
  s Library</em>. Hopefully I’ll have so much more yet to show you. ^_^</p> \n   \
