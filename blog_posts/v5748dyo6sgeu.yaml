  \ I was able to tackle in the deluxe adventure <a href=\"/products/btq01vaw?Pathfinder-Module-Cradle-of-Night\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Module: Cradle of Night</i></a> revolves around vanished gods. Few\
  \ mortals know that the Shadow Plane once had their own pantheon of wicked demigods,\
  \ akin to the Eldest of the First World. Called the Forsaken, these demigods sought\
  \ to expand their power and influence, but all of them mysteriously vanished at\
  \ once, long ago.</p> \n    <p>Although the Forsaken do not have worshippers as\
  \ other demigods do, their influence can still be felt in shadowed shrines and forgotten\
  \ ruins in the Shadow Plane and dark places of the world. The most noteworthy Forsaken\
  \ are described below as they once existed; their current forms and powers remain\
  \ purely speculation.</p> \n    <p><b>Enkaar, the Malformed Prisoner (NE Forsaken\
  \ of fetters, lethargy, and physical corruption)</b>: Left to die in a festering\
  \ prison on the Shadow Plane, Enkaar eventually emerged as a mutated horror draped\
  \ in rusted chains. Enkaar's symbol is a pus-encrusted fetter, and its favored weapon\
  \ is the spiked chain.</p> \n    <p><b>Eyes That Watch (NE Forsaken of feelings\
  \ of inferiority, felines, and strangers):</b> None can fully describe the Forsaken\
  \ known as Eyes That Watch, as it appeared only as a trio of feline eyes staring\
  \ from shadows with an arrogant gaze. Eyes That Watch's symbol is three feline eyes,\
  \ and its favored weapon is the dagger.</p> \n    <p><b>Grasping Iovett (CE Forsaken\
  \ of accidents, parasites, and reckless lust)</b>: Clad only in heavy black silks\
  \ that shifted to reveal sensual forms of an indescribable variety, Grasping Iovett's\
  \ touch left painful welts and tick infestations. Iovett's symbol is a stylized\
  \ tick on a swatch of silk, and its favored weapon is the short sword.</p> \n  \
  \  <p><b>Husk (NE Forsaken of emptiness, loneliness, and narcissism)</b>: Husk was\
  \ an attractive, androgynous humanoid whose joints were gaps that revealed the Forsaken\
  \ to be entirely hollow beneath paper-thin skin. Husk's symbol is an empty humanoid\
  \ outline with hands outstretched, and its favored weapon is the short sword.</p>\
  \ \n    <p><b>Lady Razor (NE Forsaken of family strife, suspicion, and vengeance)</b>:\
  \ A stern magistrate among the Forsaken, Lady Razor forbade showing kindness or\
  \ mercy to family members. Lady Razor's symbol is a gavel crossed with a bloody\
  \ razor, and her favored weapon is the dagger.</p> \n    <p><b>Reshmit of the Heavy\
  \ Voice (CE Forsaken of broken things, forgetting, and unexpected violence)</b>:\
  \ Reshmit was a massive shadowy form whose softest touch landed like a hammer blow\
  \ and whose rumbling voice could shred steel. Reshmit's symbol is a torn steel plate,\
  \ and his favored weapon is the morningstar.</p> \n    <p><b>Thalaphyrr Martyr-Minder\
  \ (LE Forsaken of failed heroics, imprisonment, and squandered time)</b>: Thalaphyrr\
  \ guarded the prisons where the Forsaken kept their would-be usurpers and destroyers.\
  \ Thalaphyrr's symbol is a pair of hands grasping a set of prison bars, and his\
  \ favored weapon is the spear.</p> \n    <p>Ron Lundeen<br> <i>Developer</i></p>\
