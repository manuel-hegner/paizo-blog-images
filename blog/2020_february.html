Today, I’m going to talk about our latest twist on a <a href=”https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo5lb7y?Meet-the-Iconics-Valeros”>familiar iconic fighter: Valeros</a>.</p>

	<p>In <i>Rise of the Runelords</i>, Valeros was frequently brash, crass, and surrounded by enemies, as in the cover of the very first Adventure Card Game:</p>



		<div class="blurbCenter">
		<a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/product/catalog/PZO/PZO6000.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/product/catalog/PZO/PZO6000.jpg" width="30%"></a>
<p style="font-size: 13px;">Friends, Foes, and Fun!]</p></div>

	<p>Then as now, Valeros was a common pick for people jumping into the game quickly: he had a clear role, could easily help others, and was tough enough that you could survive a few bumps on the road to experience. He started with an even mix of cards types alongside an extra helping of weapons, which naturally reinforced what you already wanted to do.</p>

		<div class="blurbCenter">
        <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/022620_RotRValerosFront.jpg"><img style="max-width:50%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/022620_RotRValerosFront.jpg"  /></a><a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/022620_RotRValerosBack.jpg"><img style="max-width:50%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/022620_RotRValerosBack.jpg"/></a>
                <p style="font-size: 13px;">Weapon, armor, weapon, tankard, weapon, weapon. Seems right!</p></div>

		<p>Once you had a few successful sessions under your weapons belt, you could start to specialize in having more choices (hand size) or getting more oomph out of your helping efforts. Eventually, these matured into the Guardian and Weapon Master roles.</p>
        
        <p>From there we moved into the nautical realm of <i>Skull & Shackles</i>. Valeros gained Fortitude, helpful for swimming, diving, and other sailing-related activities (that likely involve the tankard) alongside his ability to command a ship’s crew if needed.</p>
        
        <div class="blurbCenter"><a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/022620_SSValerosFront.jpg"><img style="max-width:50%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/022620_SSValerosFront.jpg"  /></a><a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/022620_SSValerosBack.jpg"><img style="max-width:50%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/022620_SSValerosBack.jpg"/></a>
                <p style="font-size: 13px;">Still covered in weapons? Check. Still using that tankard? Double check!</p></div>
                
                <p>His card selection shifted slightly away from armor and towards friends and comrades. As a Corsair, he could dive into the world of ships and swashbuckling, while the Tactician Valeros could be especially strong and/or helpful during critical battles.</p>
                
                <p>Valeros was one of the early characters to get the Class Deck treatment, giving us the third version of the character in relatively short order. Distinguishing him from prior versions, <i>Class Deck: Fighter</i> Valeros was focused more on the “friendly helper” aspects of the character.</p>
                <div class="blurbCenter"><a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/022620_CDValerosFront.jpg"><img style="max-width:50%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/022620_CDValerosFront.jpg"  /></a><a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/022620_CDValerosBack.jpg"><img style="max-width:50%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/022620_CDValerosBack.jpg"/></a>
                <p style="font-size: 13px;">Fiendly? Intimidating? Why not both?]</p></div>
                
                <p><i>Class Deck</i> Valeros is still tough and excellent with melee weapons, in addition to his improved personal interaction skills. His second power lets him frequently use the “big bonus” effects on weapons, which are generally around a third or more of his deck. Taking the viewpoint that these two things combine to make him “good enough” at his own combats, this Valeros gains a new ally-focused power to help his neighbors fight, while still retaining cards to help him explore on his own turns. When he gains a role card, he can choose to focus more on Daredevil-style antics (including an early instance of an “I can fight this for you” power), or adopt a Liberator mantle more focused on allies.</p>
                
                <p>For the <i>Core Set</i>, we wanted to reflect the changes to Valeros that were coming as part of the new edition, so Valeros today commonly makes use of shield and armor in addition to his hard-earned blades. He also reflects the new approach to ranged weapons as a way to coordinate during combat, gaining the Ranged skill. This lets him make good use of a wide variety of weapons for his own combats and for his friends’ combats, and with some of the exciting special effects from certain specific weapons, effectively giving him access to a wider toolkit of smash/help/utility while still making him a great choice for a quick-start “I hit it. Hard.” character.</p>
                
                <div class="blurbCenter"><a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/022620_CoreValerosCharFront.jpg"><img style="max-width:30%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/022620_CoreValerosCharFront.jpg"  /></a><a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/022620_CoreValerosCharBack.jpg"><img style="max-width:30%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/022620_CoreValerosCharBack.jpg"/></a>
                <p style="font-size: 13px;"></p></div>

				<p>Another new aspect of the <i>PACG Core Set</i> is the regular use of <b>local</b> in effects, especially helping effects. The first power of Core Set Valeros lets him add to a local combat check, which includes both his own fights as well as other characters at the same location. The new template “on a local….” gives us clean, natural wording for both “get better yourself” and “help your friends.” Reloading or recharging a card to activate this power means there’s a decision involved, but the cost is low enough that it can often be a benefit in practice. It lets you make room in your relatively small hand for new cards while saving a key card for the near or far future if the situation is dicey, and generally helps smooth over unwanted “clumps” in your deck. Yet it still keeps Valeros focused mostly on the card types most clearly associated with an iconic fighter: weapons and armor. His second power similarly helps clearing out clumps, and also makes him effectively tougher via a slow, automatic healing-like effect. It also encourages Valeros to make use of big “discard to…” effects on weapon and armor cards, producing an overall effect similar to previous iterations of the character. </p>
                
                <p>In addition to these adjustments, Valeros retains his “I can help you fight” concept via the new <b>avenge</b> mechanic, wherein a character can “have the back” of another character that runs into bad luck or overwhelming odds (or both). Roughly, when a character fails to defeat a bane, another local character can step in afterwards and take a second shot at the conflict—something that can be especially important against henchmen and villains. While this ability is available to everyone under the Core Set rules, most characters have to bury a card to do it. Valeros, the friendly helpful combat monster, can do it by discarding (or even recharging) a card… and if he uses a weapon or armor boon, he can recharge it at the end of his turn. Aces.</p>
                
                <p>Once you get a role card (which happens 1 adventure sooner than it used to), you can choose between Compatriot or Drunken Avenger.</p>
                
                <div class="blurbCenter"><a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/022620_CoreValerosCompatriot.jpg"><img style="max-width:30%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/022620_CoreValerosCompatriot.jpg"  /></a><a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/022620_CoreValerosDrunkenAvenger.jpg"><img style="max-width:30%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/022620_CoreValerosDrunkenAvenger.jpg"/></a>
                <p style="font-size: 13px;">Choices, choices. But both good choices!</p></div>
                
                <p>As a Compatriot, Valeros becomes something of a “people person.” He may use allies to accomplish many of the things he was doing pre-role with weapons and armor, including using them to help local combats (his or others), “saving” them for later turns, and picking them up more often than normal. He gains a shield-focused power to represent the new “sword and board” approach of the character. He’s also good at making friends, even potentially “borrowing” them from others. On the other side, Drunken Avenger leans into Valeros’ devotion to the Lucky Drunk. He can use Liquid boons both for themselves and to “fuel” his own abilities, and can even lean into the edges of alchemy, if you are so inclined. He might find himself emulating Cayden Cailean’s drunken wandering, where—somehow—things usually manage to work out. If some shouting, singing, shoving, and even swordplay is involved, more’s the better.</p>
                
                <p>That’s it for Valeros in the PACG Core Set. Hopefully, he retains the core (heh) characteristics that made him fun to play, while adapting some of the new concepts from the second edition of the Pathfinder RPG, the new PACG Core Set, and beyond!</p>

                <h3>NEIDR NINE</h3>
                <p><i>World of Watery Graves</i><br />
				<b>Diameter</b>: x1; <b>Mass</b>: x1<br />
				<b>Gravity</b>: x1<br />
				<b>Location</b>: The Vast<br />
				<b>Atmosphere</b>: Normal<br />
				<b>Day</b>: 27 hours; <b>Year</b>: 2 years</p>
                
                <p>Though the ninth planet of its system, Neidr Nine still lies comfortably in its bright sun’s habitable zone due to the fact that the star’s other satellites are clustered together in tight orbits. Neidr Nine is covered in a shallow ocean, with continent-sized masses of floating kelp forests that support much of the planet’s non-aquatic life.</p>
                
                <p>Neidr Nine’s post-Gap history is marred by tragedy. In the first few decades after Drift travel was granted to the galaxy, a civilization of orcs calling themselves the Lesser Belkzen Imperial Alliance attempted to conquer the Neidr system. At a casual glance, Neidr Nine seemed to be an ideal target, with its oceans and landmasses a likely supply of natural resources. Unfortunately, as the Lesser Belkzen ships descended into Neidr Nine’s atmosphere, they discovered an overwhelming abundance of life-forms not picked up by their scanners: proteans, the chaotic serpentine outsiders from the Maelstrom.</p>
                
                <p>What started as an organized colonizing expedition quickly became an all-out war as the proteans wreaked havoc on the various orc landing parties. Though the orcs fought back with gun and blade, the anarchic proteans—for reasons unknown—used a wide variety of tricks and tactics to disorient and kill the interlopers. The seaweed forests came alive to strangle. The waves rose up to drown. Weapons misfired to electrocute and burn. Starship hulls turned to basalt or stranger materials to cause deadly crashes. Soldiers suddenly turned on one another. All thanks to protean magic.</p>
                
                <p>Centuries later, what was the Lesser Belkzen Imperial Alliance is nothing more than a few scattered pockets of orc mercenaries, many of Neidr Nine’s proteans have seemingly returned to the Maelstrom, and the planet’s waterways are haunted by the ghosts of the orcs that were killed there. However, this hasn’t stopped recent attempts to turn Neidr Nine into a home.</p>
                
                <p>Over a decade ago, a collection of mutated astrazoans, each no larger than a pebble, landed their miniscule starship at the planet’s northern pole. They established a bubble city and factory named Reefworks just under the surface of the water in the crevices of a large section of brightly colored coral. The Reefworks astrazoans claim to be able produce a “ghost-proof” glass, citing the safety provided by their city’s bubble as evidence, and are happy to take purchase orders from those who can find them, although it takes them at least a month to manufacture enough of the material to be usable to larger species. Some of these astrazoans admit that the secret of the glass comes from the coral itself, which they claim can speak, though this is dismissed as rumor by Reefworks officials.</p>
                
                <p>More recently, a network of platforms and watercraft has been built on Neidr Nine’s equator by a group of intrepid skittermanders. Known as Floatsbarely, this community is at the whims of the planet’s faint currents. Friendly and welcoming, these skittermanders are willing to trade the trinkets they dredge up from beneath the waves—remnants of the Lesser Belkzen Imperial Alliance’s failed attempt to conquer the planet—for goods and supplies. As Floatsbarely travels close to the places where the Lesser Belkzen orcs suffered their largest defeats, many wonder why the community isn’t routinely harassed by ghosts and proteans. Some believe the evils find the skittermanders inoffensive enough to leave alone, while others believe the furry, six-armed sailors must offer tributes or sacrifices. Religious scholars posit that Floatsbarely must have a divine patron who keeps the residents safe, a fact given some credence by the strange temple-like structure at the community’s center. However, the skittermanders refuse to allow just anyone entrance to the building, claiming safety reasons. If an enquiring individual could discover what secrets Floatsbarely holds (if any), several interested parties would be willing to pay handsomely for them.</p>

            <p>On the Pathfinder Adventure Society side, we released one scenario! Organized Play Lead Developer Linda Zayas-Palmer gives us a preview of what is in store for players.</p>

            <p>This month, we released a spooky new adventure, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq021w2?PACS-Standalone-Adventure-1-A-Night-at-Bloodthorne-Manor">Pathfinder Adventure Card Society #1: A Night at Bloodthorne Manor</a>, which is a stand-alone adventure not related to the ongoing Year of Rotting Ruin plot. When a group of children dared each other to spend a night at a dilapidated manor house that was rumored to be haunted, most of them expected an evening of scary stories imagining what may lurk in the darkness. But the seemingly abandoned house was far from empty. Explore the mysteries of the manor, meet its occupants—both living and dead—and get the children back home safe. This adventure is designed to be particularly flexible. It’s set up for play at Tier 1, 2, 3, or 4, so you can easily pick the level that works best for your group.</p>

            <p>For Pathfinder Society (second edition) players, we released two scenarios and one quest yesterday. Organized Play developer James Case describes March’s scenarios:</p>
            
          
           <p>Our first adventure this month is <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq022x0">Pathfinder Society (second edition) Scenario #1-14: Lions of Katapesh</a>! This repeatable scenario for levels 1—4 by Adam Meyers features exactly what it says in the title, as the PCs travel to Katapesh to assist goblin merchant Yigrig Moneymaker with a problem; his expedition to build a bridge between two promising trading partners is being attacked by lions! The heroes will have to figure out what’s causing the cats to hunt down the goblin expedition, which is led by Yigrig’s son, Zig.</p>
            <div class="blurbCenter"><a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/022720_Zig.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/022720_Zig.jpg" alt="Full-body illustration of the goblin character Zig" width=50% /></a><p style="font-size: 13px;">Art by Chris Bjors</p></div>
           
           <p>We’re off to Iobaria for our second scenario, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq022x2?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-115-The-Blooming-Catastrophe">Pathfinder Society (second edition) Scenario #1-15: The Blooming Catastrophe</a>, by Mikhail Rekun. In this adventure for levels 1—4, the Pathfinder Society has their hands full as a new threat has come to Finedar Forest—a rapidly growing population of corrupted leshys that seem Abyss-bent on attacking anyone who enters the forest. This nature-themed adventure will be especially appropriate for heroes aligned with the Verdant Wheel faction, whose leader, Urwal, is on-site to try to restore the forest and figure out why the leshys seem to hate anyone wearing a <i>wayfinder</i>.</p>

			</div>
            
            <p>This month’s quest by Dennis Muldoon is <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq022wz">Pathfinder Society (second edition) Quest #7: A Curious Claim</a>, for levels 3–6. The PCs must travel to Druma to investigate an insurance claim for an “accidentally lost shipment” that some suspect may not have been as accidental as it seems. The PCs will have to get past both aquatic undead as well as agents dispatched by one of the Society’s major rivals if they hope to get to the bottom of the matter.</p>

			<p itemprop="description">We’ve got a pair of great scenarios to preview for February, from a mysterious disease that overwhelms a colony in the Vast to a check-in on a fan-favorite species. With those in mind, this month offers  great adventures to experience!</p>
            
            <p><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq022x3?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-217-Cost-of-Living">Starfinder Society #2-17: The Cost of Living</a> is a new Tier 3-6 scenario written by Andrew Mullen and Jenny Jarzabski, who’ve put in the work to come up with a truly memorable scenario. In this scenario, the PCs travel through the Vast with important medicinal goods to a colony overrun with a new disease. Arriving with the goods, the PCs must ensure the colony survives long enough to administer the newly arrived medicine, but also dive into the cause of the disease. Of course, there’s always an unexpected discovery that changes everything! If you’re interested in taking the battle to “Big Potion” then this is the scenario for you!</p>

<p>Here’s a new critter that the PCs may come across in their travels.</p>

            <p>Veteran author (and <a href="https://paizo.com/paizocon#guests">PaizoCon Gaming Guest of Honor</a>), Kate Baker, brings us <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq022x4/discuss?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-218-Forbidden-Tides">Starfinder Society #2-18: Forbidden Tides</a>, a scenario that takes us back to the morlamaw home world of Arniselle. We first encountered the morlamaws way back in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9x0y?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-108-Sanctuary-of-Drowned-Delight">Starfinder Society #1-08: Sanctuary of Drowned Delight</a> where a group of Starfinders made first-contact with the walrus-like species and brought them into greater galactic affairs. Since that fateful meeting, the morlamaws have expanded beyond their world, even appearing in the recently released <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01zof?Starfinder-Alien-Archive-3">Starfinder Alien Archive 3</a>. This visit back to Arniselle shows us a bit of what the morlamaws have been up to in the meantime. Also, pay no heed to the cover art. Nothing to worry about there. Nope, nothing at all.</p>
            
            <p>While you’re not thinking about that cover art and what it means, have some art for our newest venture-captain, the kalo Suulhu-Huur.</p>

            <p>Alrighty, that’s it for February’s releases! Want a sneak peek into next month’s offerings? Of course you do! March gives us a new repeatable scenario that takes us into the Veskarium, and a scenario that acts as a major pivot point in our ongoing metaplot.</p>
            
            <p>Lots more stuff before then though. Including this afternoon, when we preview the Pathfinder Society offerings for February. Don’t forget to check back! </p>
            
            <p>Until next time,</p>

				<p itemprop="description">Unveiling the Pathfinder Second Edition Gamemastery Guide!</p>
                <p>As the Game Master of a Pathfinder campaign, you’re the architect of your players’ adventures—a rewarding but sometimes challenging responsibility. With this book, your job just got a whole lot easier! Whether you’re building your own monsters and adventures, looking for new subsystems to play out cinematic chases or tense infiltrations, or simply want to speed up your game with scores of NPCs ready for action, the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq022c1?Pathfinder-Gamemastery-Guide"><i>Gamemastery Guide</i></a> has you covered!</p>

                
				<div class="blurbCenter">
			<a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/022520_GMGCover.jpg"><img style="max-width:50%"  src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/022520_GMGCover.jpg" alt="Pathfinder second edition gamemastery guide"/></a>
		        </div>
                
                <p>The focus of every Pathfinder game is the players—their characters are the stars of the show and appear in every scene that plays out in game. But what about those scenes? What stories are being told? What old legends are being discovered, and what new ones are being forged? Who are the villains, the allies, the traitors, the lovers, the monsters, and the gods? Who runs the world? When you’re the Game Master, that’s all up to you!</p>
                
                <div class="blurbCenter">
			<a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/022420_GMGToC.jpg"><img style="max-width:50%"  src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/022420_GMGToC.jpg" alt=""/></a>
		        </div>
                
                <h2>Chapter 1: Gamemastery Basics</h2>
                
                <p>The role of a GM can be complex, challenging, and sometimes difficult, but ultimately rewarding. Luckily, you’re not on your own! Not only will the other players at your game table help you tell collaborative stories, but you can use the advice here to make your games run more smoothly and feel more exciting.</p>

                <p>Inside you’ll find guidance on Running Encounters, Running Exploration, Running Downtime, Adjudicating Rules, Resolving Problems, Narrative Collaboration, Special Circumstances, Rarity in Your Game, Campaign Structure, Adventure Design, Encounter Design, and Drawing Maps.</p>
                
                <h2>Chapter 2: Tools</h2>
                
                <p>While the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01zp3?Pathfinder-Core-Rulebook"><i>Core Rulebook</i></a> provides all the tools you need to be a Game Master, you may want resources to create original game content, whether it be new items, unique creatures, or a sprawling new world for adventurers to explore.</p>

<p>Inside you’ll find tools for Building Creatures, Building Hazards, Building Items, Item Quirks, Intelligent Items, Cursed Items, Relics, Artifacts, Gems and Art Objects, Afflictions, Building Worlds, Nations, Settlements, and Planes.</p>
                
                <h2>Chapter 3: Subsystems</h2>
                
                <p>When your game goes into uncharted territory or you want to emphasize an element of gameplay that usually gets overlooked or condensed into a single check, you can use a subsystem. As the name implies, subsystems are extensions of the main rules system that allow you to explore a particular topic or style of play at your table.</p>
                
                <p>You’ll find subsystems for Victory Points, Influence, Research, Chases, Infiltration, Reputation, Duels, Leadership, Hexploration, and Vehicles</p>
                
                <div class="blurbCenter">

		        </div>
                
                <h2>Chapter 4: Variant Rules</h2>
                
                <p>While the rules presented in the Core Rulebook are designed to give you and your group a baseline experience that’s easy to learn and fun to play, sometimes you’re looking for more customizable options. That’s where variant rules come in: options to alter the game’s rules to fit your needs. This chapter adds a collection of variant rules to your toolbox, often with additional options for how to use them.</p>
                
                <p>You’ll find variant rules on Ability Score Variants, Alignment Variants, Deep Backgrounds, Feats and Features, Level 0 Characters, Magic Item Variants, Proficiency without Level Skill Points, and Stamina.</p>
                
                <h2>Chapter 5: NPC Gallery</h2>
                
                <p>Monsters and PCs aren’t the only inhabitants of your world. Though they might not be heroes, NPCs can play various roles in your game, such as calling PCs to adventure, serving as obstacles in social encounters, or opposing PCs in battle. This chapter presents almost a hundred NPCs for your game, plus rules to modify them to fit any particular niche.</p>
                
                <p>You’ll find a gallery of Courtiers, Criminals, Devotees, Downtrodden, Explorers, Foresters, Healers, Laborers, Magistrates, Mercenaries, Mystics, Officers, Performers, Publicans, Scholars, Seafarers, Tradespeople, and Villains.</p>

  <h1>The Threefold Conspiracy: Gray Matter</h1>
  <p class="date"><time datetime="2020-02-26T19:00:00Z">Feb 26, 2020, 11:00 am</time></p>
  <p itemprop="description">A bearded man clad in blue armor raced through the side corridors of Absalom Station, his gold-trimmed capelet flapping behind him. His eyes wild, he threw glances over his shoulder as he careened around corners and nearly toppled precariously stacked piles of empty crates and garbage. He came to a skidding halt in front of an unmarked door to a nondescript structure and quickly tapped an eight-digit code in the nearby keypad, muttering, “Hurry, hurry” to himself. The multiple locks disengaged with a series of electronic clicks and the man threw open the door with a sharp exhalation. The light beyond spilled into the alleyway.</p>

		<p itemprop="description">A bearded man clad in blue armor raced through the side corridors of Absalom Station, his gold-trimmed capelet flapping behind him. His eyes wild, he threw glances over his shoulder as he careened around corners and nearly toppled precariously stacked piles of empty crates and garbage. He came to a skidding halt in front of an unmarked door to a nondescript structure and quickly tapped an eight-digit code in the nearby keypad, muttering, “Hurry, hurry” to himself. The multiple locks disengaged with a series of electronic clicks and the man threw open the door with a sharp exhalation. The light beyond spilled into the alleyway.</p>
        
        <hr color="#696969">
        
        <blockquote>
        	<p><i>The bright light enveloped Reyard Maldun as he dozed fitfully on the couch in his office. He had sat down for just a moment to rest his eyes after a long day of filing reports, thinking he would soon grab a bite for dinner at the noodle stand just outside the base, but clearly more than a few minutes had passed. To Reyard’s ears, it sounded like the rest of the office was empty. He tried to move his arm to block the light from his face but found that he couldn’t. He was paralyzed. All he could do was breathe and wait.</i></p>
            <p><i>Seconds later, he felt himself being lifted up, weightless in the beam of light. He began to float gently toward the window. He could see his face—a mask of terror—reflected in the glass as he seemed to phase quietly through it and into the night sky beyond.</i></p>

        <p>Looking at himself in the mirror, Reyard ran his fingers through his matted brown hair. How long had it been since he had it cut? How long since he had taken a shower? Eaten a good meal? Gotten a full night’s sleep?</p>
        
        <p>No matter. Such trivialities were for those not being hunted.</p>
        
        <p>He stepped out of the small bathroom, added to the converted storefront almost as an afterthought. When he realized he might be spending hours, perhaps days, here, he had brought in a canvas cot and had the toilet and sink installed. He had paid the plumber extra to quietly hook into the neighborhood’s water main without alerting the neighbors. The building wasn’t zoned for residential use.</p>
        
        <p>Not that Reyard was living here, exactly. This was merely his command center, his base of operations. A place where he could perform his “unsanctioned” investigations in privacy… Hopefully.</p>
        
        <p>Most of the space was occupied by a large wooden desk, a small server tower, several plastic storage bins, and a pair of free-standing holomarker boards. The bins were empty, their contents spread across the floor: printouts of infosphere pages, cheap datapads displaying a series of blurry photographs, and random pieces of other technology in various states of disassembly. Paper notebooks cluttered the desk, each open to pages filled with dense walls of text and hasty sketches. The tidiest portion of the desk’s surface held an array of electronic tools in neat row. Reyard reached for one.</p>
        
        <hr color="#696969">
        
        <p>
        
        <blockquote>
        	<p><i>The alien reached for the laser scalpel with long, slender fingers, selecting the instrument from one of others lined up precisely on a tray of shiny, silver metal. Reyard lay on a table of similar material, restrained by several bands of glowing energy. He tried to cry out, but his mouth was frozen shut, his tongue a useless lump of meat. The alien turned back to face him. Though it was no more than three feet tall, it loomed over Reyard as it peered unblinking at his helpless form. It ignited the scalpel and the blackness of its large eyes seemed to swallow him whole.</i></p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <hr color="#696969">
        
        <p>The dark monitors on his desk flared to life, and the computer prompted Reyard to enter a series of passwords and to finally press his eye to a retinal scanner before presenting him with his home desktop. Like the room, the computer was a mess of files and programs, arranged in no particular order.</p>
        
        <p>Reyard connected the computer to the infosphere, entering another password that bypassed the security to prevent such a thing from happening by accident. He initiated a program of his own design that would upload the contents of the server—months and months of his painstaking research—to multiple infosphere sites simultaneously. Using various aliases, he had compared notes with other truth seekers on these sites, some more in touch with reality than others. He knew his pursuers would quickly find and erase all instances of his uploads before the night was over, but he hoped that in doing so, they wouldn’t look for the notebooks he stashed around the station. Reyard looked over at the door. He whispered, “Come on, you bastards. Where are you?”</p>
        
        <hr color="#696969">
        <blockquote>
        	<p><i>“Where is your head, Maldun? I remember when you were one of my top agents.” Chief Inspector Theovos was a stout korasha lashunta woman with truncated antennae. She sat behind her imposing desk in her Stewards armor and waited for Reyard to respond. He simply stared at his boots and muttered an apology.</i></p>

        	<p><i>“Several months ago,” Theovos said, pulling up a file on a datapad, “You reported that you had been abducted from your office in the dead of night. Building security found no signs of intrusion. And though you claimed to have been operated on, medical can’t detect a thing wrong with you. A psych eval determined you were disturbed by a particularly vivid dream, but you have refused further counseling. Since then, you’ve been pursuing these ‘little gray men’ to the detriment of your other work, dredging up only a mass of ridiculous conspiracy theories and turning yourself into the laughingstock of the base.”</i></p>

        	<p><i>Reyard opened his mouth to speak, but Theovos cut him off. “No. Don’t bother. I’m transferring you to Absalom Station for desk duty until you at least agree to seek help for these delusions.” Her eyes softened a bit. “Reyard, there’s still time.”</i></p>

        </blockquote>
        <hr color="#696969">
        
        <p>It would still take several moments until the uploads were complete. Reyard hoped there would be enough time. He peered up at the ceiling. With any luck, he had installed the electronic trip sensors correctly.</p>
        
        <p>The door behind him dematerialized with a flash. A small figure with gray skin and bulbous head stood silhouetted in the entrance.</p>
        
        <p>“Try to take me again if you want, but the moment you step inside this room, a force field will block your exit and half a dozen vidcams will stream your ugly mug all across the infosphere.” The alien didn’t move. A chime from the computer indicated the uploads were finished. Reyard smiled. “That’s the sound of the whole system learning the truth. Hide all you want. Someone will always shine a light in the dark corners of the universe.”</p>
        
        <p>A single word pierced his thoughts.</p>
        
        <p><i>Incorrect.</i></p>
        
        <p>Suddenly, the power to the building was cut. The room was plunged into darkness.</p>

            	<p>We've come a long way from our hastily built set in a friend's garage. The core of the show remains an awesome campaign and epic storytelling, but DaT: Vantam is a serious upgrade for actual-play live streaming as a genre. This new campaign achieves that not just with a compelling narrative and impressive visuals, but by exploring a world in greater depth than any other show by telling two concurrent stories set against the same immersive backdrop. Every Tuesday, DaT: Vantam will feature a party of fledgling heroes looking to make it in a fast-paced city brought to its knees by a magical disaster of terrifying proportions. Then, each Friday, DaT: Vantam will focus on a tale of survival and intrigue as prisoners in an underwater prison struggle to escape a facility crumbling around them as a consequence of the very same disaster their surface counterparts attempt to contain. While each story is a self-contained plotline that serves as a complete experience on its own, fans able to watch both streams live will certainly appreciate the way the two tales intersect. </p>
                
                <p>While the spine of DaT: Vantam remains epic storytelling, its heart remains the interaction between the fans and the players. Joining a live stream gives every member of the audience a chance to kick back, chat with the cast, hang out with DaT Family, and even affect the game directly with their contributions. Send bonuses and buffs to the players, or sow chaos with wild magic effects if you choose, there are a wide range of options for joining in on the action. If you'd rather just chat, the community is welcoming and vibrant, and the cast reads and responds to comments live on the stream. </p>
                
                <p>If you're looking for a new story to sink your teeth into, DaT: Vantam is the perfect opportunity to get in on the ground floor. Every stream runs for 3 hours, with a short break at the mid-point where you grab a re-fill on snacks or watch some silly shorts. The Tuesday run begins on Feb 25th, and the Friday run starts Feb 28th, all streams starting at 6 p.m. Pacific.  If you can't make the stream live, VOD episodes will be available shortly after the LIVE episodes, and audio-only versions will be made available as well. Just tune in to <a href="http://twitch.tv/thedatnetwork" target="_blank">twitch.tv/thedatnetwork</a>. Welcome to DaT Family!</p>

            <p>A crew of adventurers-for-hire thrust into the middle of a monumental disaster will decide how far they are willing to go for the promise of profit. As the powerful try to buy the heroes' loyalty, they are left wondering whether their job is to put fires out or start new ones. When no good deed goes unpunished, and every bad deed offers pay, this crew must ask themselves whether they are heroes or mercenaries. </p>

            <p>On the day of their release, two former inmates and their advocates find themselves trapped in an underwater prison in the wake of a terrible disaster. With no way to access the surface and return to their disrupted lives, they struggle to survive as the prison threatens to collapse and kill everyone inside. Can they find a way out of an inescapable facility, and even if they can, is there any place for them in a city that already took away their freedom once before?</p>

            <p>Starfinder has a fairly large galaxy full of amazing creatures and stories. So wanting to learn more about this world, and seeing how some of you have been itching to know certain things about the Starfinder universe. We snagged Creative Director Rob McCreary and Developer John Comption and convinced them to sit down on stream and talk to you our audience about anything Starfinder. How did Absalom Station come to existence? Why are Skittermanders so helpful? How many Vesk does it take to install a matter converter?
We hope to see you live on Twitch!

			<p>Relics, artifact, magic items, oh my!<br />
Every desire of every Pathfinder is loot. But for some, a simple silver sword just won’t cut it. They want items that make them feel epic, and the Pathfinder Second Edition <i>Gamemastery Guide</i> is just the tool needed to help setup the obstacles required to overcome to acquire the legendary items provided to you. Or, items you made your own.
During our show today this Pathfinder Friday, we wish to show you how you can create your own magical items for your campaign. Along with how Relics and Artifacts can give your party a goal to shoot for.

            <h2>Court of Corvids with QueueTimes, March 1, 4:30 p.m.</h2>
            <p><i>Court of Corvids</i> is an actual play show that takes place in a homebrew setting using the Pathfinder Second Edition ruleset. It is currently on hiatus having finished its second story arc but will return with a brand new one on Sunday, February 23rd at 4:30 p.m. Pacific.</p>
            <p>In this setting, facts and fiction blur together. In fact, the story began with a lie, one that grew so much it became the central pillar for an entire community…that is until the party stumbled upon the truth and brought it all down. Since then, they’ve been on the road, trying to find their place in a vast world they didn’t even know existed for most of their lives.</p>
            <p>The party, taken through this world by GM and occult enthusiast Jacob Kile, consists of:</p>
            <ul>
            	<li><b>Croog Claudel</b>, played by Croog: A human monk searching for his long-lost siblings, hoping to make amends when he finds them.</li>
                <li><b>Moss the Magnificent</b>, played by Molly McIsaac: An Elven Sorcerer trying to recapture the fame she had back home.</li>
                <li><b>Robyn Way</b>, played by Jonas Newhouse: A Gnome druid desperate to hide from her former life and family. She’s married to Remi.</li>
                <li><b>Remi Ashwillow</b>, played by William White: The Goblin fighter and Robyn’s partner is just trying to make friends and live life after being stuck in a cult for many years.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We covered lots of recent announcements, including those of the first <a href ="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh3w?February-Update-Achievement-Points-Stars#discuss">5-nova GMs</a> and the addition of <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh42?Organized-Play-New-Faces-New-Places#discuss">Alex Speidel</a> to the team as our Organized Play Associate. We talked about <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh3i?Starfinder-Society-Sanctioning-Update#discuss">past sanctioning efforts</a> and our expectation that we would announce future sanctioning at the beginning of a month. We also noted we updated the Regional Support Program for 2020 and that the program would function as it had in prior years. Thurston previewed the last few scenarios coming out in April and May (we will get product pages up for them soon): </p>

			</div>
            
            <p>We also previewed the awesome art for the newest Starfinder Society spaceship – The Gorgon! This piece of art will be added to the ships portion of the Guide for Year 3.  At this point, we intend the guide remain a printable pdf download, as we haven’t resolved the bugs on the Pathfinder (second edition) guide and don’t want to swap Starfinder Society assets until we have solved the issues.  This news also applies to Achievement Points (AcP) for Starfinder Soceity.  Thurston, Linda, and I keep evaluating the situation and will announce changes to either guides or AcP in our Thursday blogs.  After meeting with internal stakeholders, we decided to move the Org Play blogs to Thursday to help workflow for Org Play teammembers.  There may be days where this slips, but our plan involves posting most Org Play blogs on Thursdays (or sometimes even twice on Thursday!)</p>
            
            <p>Before I turn the blog over to Thurston for an in-depth dive into Year 3, I want to once more amplify the call for volunteers that the Organized Play Foundation made last week.  Offering games means lots of GMS/HQ volunteers and we still have spaces available for all the major conventions.  You can find a list of rewards and the volunteer applications on the <a href="http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/convention-volunteer-information/" target="_blank">Organized Play Foundation website</a> or in last week’s <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh43?Organized-Play-Foundation-Call-for-Volunteers#discuss">Call to Vol</a> blog.</p>
            
            <p>See you next week for previews of our montly Society releases!</p>
            
            <p>Until then – Explore, Report, Cooperate!</p>

            <hr>
            
            <p>Drumroll please! The Organized Play Team is proud to announce the title of Year 3… The Year of Exploration’s Edge.</p>
            
            <p>After two years of epic space operate fantasy in the Scoured Stars, followed by then our current year of battling against a social media smear campaign organized by a now rather infamous NPC, our third season (Technically forth, since Season 1 spanned two years) takes us to new frontiers. Exploration’s Edge is about getting back to basics as Starfinders and focusing on things that are at the heart of what it means to be a Starfinder. Obviously, exploring sites both old and new is paramount to the theme of this new season, but there’s a few other key elements changing in Exploration’s Edge, so let’s take a look!</p>
            
            <p>First off, <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh1x?Starfinder-Society-Year-3-Preview-A-New-First">as previously announced on our Twitch stream and in a blog</a>, Year 3 opens with a new First Seeker. Ehu Hadif guides the Society into its next phase of missions, and as someone focused on ensuring that the Society gets back to its roots of discovery and research, Ehu really drives a lot of this upcoming year’s core concepts. Along with a variety of faction missions associated with Ehu Hadif, the upcoming Starfinder Society Guide includes a new Second Seekers faction that provides all the boons and bonuses necessary to really champion the cause of the Society’s new leader. We’re looking forward to all the new (and old) characters who take up Ehu Hadif’s cause.</p>

			</div>
            
            <p>Next up, let’s talk metaplot. Over the course of our first two years of Starfinder Society, it has been clear that there’s a lot of players who’ve really enjoyed the expansive metaplots that weave their way through many scenarios, but just as many players like the episodic nature of the Starfinder Society. To change things up, we’re pumping the breaks on having one large overarching metaplot and are going to take this opportunity to try something a bit different. With the season focus of exploration lending itself much more to “missions of the month” rather than an expansive story, our plan for this season isn’t to have a single metaplot, but instead break things down into several multi-part scenario series. </p>
            
            <p>
Past multi-part stories needed playing in the order published to really participate in the story and we named them as such, for instance <i>PFS 10-22</i> and <i>10-23: Passing the Torch</i> series, which had a Part 1 and Part 2. For Year 3, the arcs are more thematically tied together than an A/B/C structure. They actually won’t be numbered by part. Instead, we structured the titles SFS 03-XX: Arc Title: Scenario Title. For organizers, this means you can schedule them in any order!</p>

			<p>The Year of Exploration’s Edge will include three storyline arcs, each spread across a variety of levels, but most easily explained as low-level, mid-level, and (excitement) high-level story arcs. Without giving too much away on each of the story arcs, here’s a brief summary of what to expect:</p>
            <p><b>Low-Level Arc (Tiers 1-4 + 3-6):</b> What’s exciting about this story arc is that it’s predominantly going to be Tier 1-4 scenarios, making it the perfect onboarding series of adventures for new players. For our veterans looking to start up a new character, this arc is also going to be our first real deep dive into the worlds of Near Space, with some heavy influence by the Veskarium. With <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01zud?Starfinder-RPG-Near-Space"><i>Starfinder Near Space</i></a> just around the bend, this seemed like the perfect opportunity to really dive into this part of the galaxy.</p>
            
            <p><b>Mid-Level Arc (Tiers 5-8 + 7-10):</b> The mid-range of levels in Starfinder is where exploration into the unknown can really start to pay off in terms of narrative options, so this arc was the perfect opportunity to explore the Vast. However, in order to better coordinate with <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq0225g?Starfinder-RPG-Starship-Operations-Manual">a certain upcoming product</a>, one of the main goals for this story arc is to have the Society work alongside a corporation to test out a potential new starship hull. This also presents us with the exciting opportunity to use our Chronicle sheets to give PCs wider customization options for starships, and determine potential future designs used by the Starfinder Society!</p>
            
            <p><b>High-Level Arc (Tiers 9-12 + 11-14):</b> Though not the highest levels of the Starfinder RPG (we’re getting there), this arc is roughly the highest reaches most of our dedicated players will have PCs in the level range of—barring all your dedicated Adventure Path players out there! For our high-level story arc, we wanted to look back at the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9zkn?Starfinder-Pact-Worlds">Pact Worlds</a>, in particular some loose threads first seeded in early Season 1 and involving the Society’s past actions. With Hellknights on the prowl and a journey that goes from Verces to Eox, what else could be missing? Well, there’s one particular planet in the Pact Worlds star system we haven’t visited yet. Specifically, there’s a certain far-flung planetoid that might be utterly inhospitable to all but the highest-level characters... hopefully you’ll be ready to go there.</p>
            
            <p>OK, so with all the fancy announcements about what’s happening in the Year of Exploration’s Edge, there’s one final topic to discuss today: the opening interactive special. Starfinder Society #3-00: The Last Bite, brings the story of Year of a Thousand Bites to climactic conclusion and serves as the opener to our third year. This Tier 1-8 interactive special has the PCs taking part in one last mission for outgoing First Seeker Luwazi Elsebo, working as a team to thwart the machinations of the mischievous ysoki known as Datch. Written by longtime Paizo author Jenny Jarzabski, this interactive is sure to have the PCs at the edge of their seats as they race to stop Datch from enacting her greatest scheme yet: plunging one of the Pact Worlds’ paramount institutions into chaos. Given the more “personal scope” of this year’s interactive, we opted to really focus on a set of Subtiers, making it easier on those GMs running our interactives. We hope the upcoming Season 3 high-level content accommodates those of you players out there who want to get your players gaming right away!</p>
            
            <p>Come see us at upcoming events, where we can talk more about future plans for the Starfinder Society.  Until then, let the hype for the Year of Exploration’s Edge begin!</p>
            
            <p>Signing off for now,</p>

                <h2>Ailuran</h2>
                <p>Ailurans are reclusive fey with an obsession for silver. This fixation makes them a pesky foil to silver miners and werecreatures alike. Though the creatures don’t necessarily harbor any ill will to others and would prefer to just be left alone, miners consider them pests. Ailurans, sometimes called silver seekers, are infamous for sneaking into or breaking into silver mines to obtain the object of their affection—silver. Miners, not wanting to be stolen from, keep alert for ailuran activity. </p>
                
                <p>It’s unsure why ailurans have an animosity to werecreatures, but their obsession with silver serves them well in this regard. Some ailurans use the silver they collect to make silver weapons they use to hunt down these shapeshifters. Werecreatures aware of this enmity tend to avoid regions where ailurans live.</p>
                
                <p>Ailurans live in small groups in secluded forested hills and mountains—typically locations in which silver can be found in abundance. When not raiding mines, ailurans can be found in trees where they often make their homes. They have a supernatural ability to sense the presence of silver and have been known to accost travelers and charge them a silver toll to allow passage through their lands. While not outwardly friendly, many ailurans are open to trade and will barter with creatures passing through their forests. However, if a visitor makes a bad impression, the creatures sometimes use their illusory magic to create false silver items they use to trade, leaving the traveler empty handed once the magic’s duration runs out.</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline">Rise of the Runelords: Shalelu Be Food?</h1>
<p class="date" style="margin-bottom:1rem !important;">Wednesday, February 19, 2020</p>
	
<div itemprop="articleBody">
	<div class="blurbCenter" style="display: none;"><a href="/image/content/Blog/021820_RunelordsPreview_500.jpeg"><img src="/image/content/Blog/021820_RunelordsPreview_500.jpeg"></a></div>
    
	<blockquote>
		<p itemprop="description">She heard them before she saw them.</p>
        
        <p>“...Bones be cracked, flesh be stewed"</p>	
		<p>“We be goblins! You be food!”</p>
	
		<p>Shalelu’s lip curled in a half-conscious snarl at the song. She crept closer, slipping from the forest to a knot of gnarled old pear trees that the farmer, or more likely the farmer’s great-grandparents, had planted by the house. Under the tangled branches, heavy with ripe fall fruit, she peered at the singing goblins.</p>
        
        <p>The barn was already burning. Judging by the height of the flames leaping from its blackened roof, the farmers must have brought in the fall hay, and it was now blazing merrily behind a ring of dancing goblins. At least there weren’t any screams. Any animals in the barn either had escaped, or were already dead.</p>
        
        <p>The fire’s grip was closing around the farmhouse, too. Burning arrows studded the roof. The eaves were smoldering, the wooden shingles beginning to glow from beneath like a red dragon’s scales—and even as Shalelu tried to assess how much longer the house had, she saw the curtains twitch before an upstairs window. The brief round shape of a face peeked out through the glass. It vanished almost as soon as it appeared, but it was enough to tell Shalelu that someone was inside.</p>
        
        <p>Well, that tore it. Not that she needed much of a push where goblins were concerned.</p>
        
        <p>Smoothly, with the ease of long practice, Shalelu broke from the trees and shot the first goblin. Even before her first arrow hit, she had another flying. Two goblins fell, one clutching at an arrow in his red-gurgling throat, the other with a feathered shaft sprouting from her eye.</p>
        
        <p>She shot a third before the rest reacted. As the third goblin fell, his screech cut off by the arrow bisecting his windpipe, the survivors spotted the elf. A frozen instant passed between them. Shalelu felt a flashed hope that the goblins’ cowardice might drive them to flee, even though she stood alone—but no. Their wavering morale caught and steadied as the biggest goblin leaped toward her, brandishing a rickety but sharp-edged dogslicer.</p>
        
        <p>“Brave, brave warriors! Warriors of the Mosswood! Kill this elf! Kill her!” the big goblin howled. As a battlefield speech, Shalelu felt it was uninspired, but whatever it lacked in creativity, it made up in volume. Certainly the goblins seemed to think it did the trick, because they all came rushing at her in a shrieking, knee-high mob of red eyes, needle teeth, and swinging dogslicers, simultaneously absurd and deadly earnest.</p>
        
        <p>The shouting champion at the head of the mob was the most ridiculous of them all. She wore a decapitated toy horse’s head impaled on her spiked helm, with puffs of woolly stuffing flapping around her enormous ears. Her cloak was as green and moldy as any other Mosswood goblin’s, but she’d trimmed it with dogs’ tails: poodles’ dirt-stained pompoms, curly blond spaniels’ plumes, a mastiff’s grizzled stub. Another tail hung from the pommel of her dogslicer.</p>
        
        <p>It would have been a mistake to dismiss the goblin as a joke, though. People died for such mistakes. That toy horse’s neck was smeared with real blood; those tails had been collected from real dogs, and some of them looked like they’d been big and fierce. The grisly kneecaps that served as the goblin’s pauldrons were real flesh and bone, and from their ragged edges had probably been chewed off human legs. Maybe live ones.</p>
        
        <p>That was the danger with goblins, Shalelu thought. You laughed at them, thinking they were stupid and big-headed and preposterous, and then they slashed your ankles and pulled you down and cut your throat before you realized that they were, actually, serious as murder.</p>
        
                		<div class="blurbCenter">
			<a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/021820_Runelords.png"><img style="max-width:100%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/021820_Runelords.png" alt="" /></a>

		</div>
        
        <p>She wondered whether someone had made that mistake with these goblins. They’d been in a fight recently. Several were limping or favoring wounded sides and limbs. One looked like he’d narrowly dodged a spell; a burn scar streaked black across his forehead. But the goblins had survived, which meant maybe whoever they’d fought hadn’t.</p>
        
        <p>A small mystery. If she survived, maybe she’d try to solve it.</p>
        
        <p>First she had to survive.</p>
        
        <p>Shalelu aimed past the charging champion and shot two more goblins, wounding the first and felling the second. Then the champion was on her, and Shalelu had to skitter back, slinging her bow behind a shoulder and drawing her shortsword. She feinted and retreated back toward the farmhouse. The fire was spreading, and she didn’t have long to save whoever was in there.</p>
        
        <p>“Uruvuu Kneebiter will wear your head!” the big goblin crooned at Shalelu, sweeping her dogslicer low.</p>
        
        <p>“Uru-who?” Shalelu snorted, straining to sound nonchalant. That goblin was faster than she liked. “Do you fancy yourself one of the big heroes? Should Vorka and Ripnugget cower and whine at your name?”</p>
        
        <p>“They will!” Uruvuu hissed, and leaped.</p>
        
        <p>The elf kicked at the goblin, but to her astonishment, Uruvuu jumped over the kick, grabbed her leg, and bit her, sinking her filthy teeth into Shalelu’s leg just above the knee.</p>
        
        
        <p>“Get off!” Shalelu slashed down at the goblin, hacking one of Uruvuu’s grisly pauldrons in two and cutting a deep gash into the champion’s shoulder. Uruvuu just lifted her head and grinned up horribly, her teeth dripping red.</p>
        
        <p>“I’ll eat you,” the goblin snarled, and bit Shalelu again.</p>
        
        <p>Shalelu swore furiously. She couldn’t get Uruvuu off her leg. If it had just been the one goblin, Shalelu could have made short work of her — but there were far too many of them, almost a dozen, and not just Mosswood, either. She spotted warty Licktoad goblins and tattooed, reed-wearing Brinestumps, and wondered: what are they all doing together? The tribes did not easily ally.</p>
        
        <p>But the question seemed to float far away, untethered to the violence on the ground. Shalelu was losing too much blood, maybe going into shock. She slashed at a leering goblin and ripped his abdomen open, spilling his guts wetly into the barn’s blowing ashes, but still there were too many, and still Uruvuu was gnawing at her knee. Is this how it ends?</p>

		<p>Overhead, the farmhouse window slammed open. Strange pale leaves floated down. No, not leaves, Shalelu realized, even as she cut another goblin’s throat so savagely that its head flopped backwards, limply, over the gouting stump of its neck. They were pages. She recognized the illustrations.</p>
        
        <p>Pages from Erastil’s <i>Book of Common Prayer</i>, ripped out by the handful. Someone had drawn crude goblin faces in thick, sweeping strokes over each one. The ink was still wet enough that the faces stuck lightly together when they kissed.</p>
        
        <p>But they drifted apart, falling, and when they came down over the fight, the goblins broke apart in total pandemonium. “The words! Words! Stolen out of our heads! You see them! Take them back! The cursed words! Burn them!”</p>
        
        <p>Frantically the goblins grabbed at the ink-smeared pages, thrusting them into the barn’s blaze. They forgot about Shalelu entirely, each one vying to grab and burn pages of precious, stolen words. Even Uruvuu shrieked in terror, blood bubbling through her teeth as she elbowed her kin aside to snatch up her own pages.</p>
        
        <p>Shalelu cut down another two goblins in the confusion. Then the rest, realizing that they were outnumbered—or, at least, were now facing Shalelu with odds no better than six to one, which seemed to count as “outnumbered” to them—fled, screaming, from the bloodied elf and the still-falling rain of pages around her.</p>
        
        <p>“Thanks,” Shalelu called up to whoever was in the farmhouse. Her leg felt like murder. She pressed a wooden wand against the wound, gritting her teeth until the magic flowed forth to heal her. Then, testing her weight gingerly, she looked up to the window. Already she could hear the goblins shouting and arguing as they tried to regroup in the wood, and see the red reach of flames spreading across the roof. “You’d better come out. We need to get to Sandpoint before they come back.”</p>
        
        <p>More than safety, Shalelu wanted answers. This attack was unusual. Fractious rival tribes allied and attacking humans far outside their normal territory. Champions striving to make new legends for themselves. She’d been hunting the local goblins for years, and she’d never seen them cooperate like this.</p>
        
        <p>Something strange was afoot. And whatever it was, this was just the beginning.</p>

	<p><a href="https://paizo.com/riseOfTheRunelords">Rise of the Runelords</a> was the very first Pathfinder Adventure Path, and its legacy—be it the cruel comedy of goblins and ogres, the iconic seaside town of Sandpoint, or the sinister presence of the Runelords themselves—can be felt to this very day. Rise of the Runelords was the first Pathfinder Adventure Path to be compiled into a single hardcover volume, and later this year it will be the first Adventure Path to join the ranks of the Pathfinder pocket editions! Rise of the Runelords has never been more affordable!</p>

                <p>Hail Starfinders,</p>
                
                <p>The <a href="https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventurePath/threefoldconspiracy">Threefold Conspiracy Adventure Path</a> begins February 26, 2020. What begins as a normal trip through the Drift back to the Pact Worlds turns into a mind-bending whodunit as a crewmember goes missing. The heroes must unravel an intricate web of motives and opportunities before they discover the seeming truth behind the disappearance. </p>

        	<p>The details of this campaign are classified. Therefore, in preparation for this or any mystery campaign, I’ve scoured the Starfinder archive to collate some general advice and inspiration you.</p>
            
            <p>Let’s set the stage with an excerpt from the six-page article <i>Mystery Adventures</i> by Jason Keeley in volume one of the Starfinder Adventure Path #25: <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq022bl?Starfinder-Adventure-Path-25-The-Chimera-Mystery"><i>The Chimera Mystery</i></a>.</p>
            
            <blockquote>
            	<p><i>“You see, Mrs. Braintner, only you have knowledge of the rare poison that was found coursing through Count Correndo’s veins, only you were seen leaving the hedge maze on the night of the crime, and only you were aware of the last-minute change to the count’s will in which you wouldn’t have received a solitary credit. You had the means, the opportunity, and the motive. Those are the facts, and there’s no use in saying otherwise. Therefore, only you could have committed this heinous murder! Ghenkins, if you would be so kind as to escort this cold-blooded killer to the police hovervan waiting outside?”<br />
—excerpt from the popular weekly holovid “Detective Death”</i></p>

				<h3>A MYSTERY’S THREE PILLARS</h3>
                <p>Whether the mystery occurs on a high-tech space station or in a colony settlement on a backwater planet, the culprit has a means, motive, and opportunity to commit the crime. Some suspects might have one or two of these elements. However, the true criminal must have all three.</p>
                
                <h4>MEANS</h4>
          		<p>A suspect has the means to commit a crime if they are physically able to do so. Could they reliable fire a pistol to kill the victim with one shot? Are they dexterous enough to reach the only window that showed signs it was forced open? Do they have the knowledge to be able to create a malignant computer virus?</p>
                
                <p>Some crimes are simple enough that all suspects could conceivably have the means to commit them. Other times, the means by which a crime was committed are unknown or indefinite. In such cases, discovering the culprit’s motive and opportunity becomes even more important. However, knowing that a suspect couldn’t possibly have had the means to perpetuate the crime is probably the easiest way to eliminate them from the list.</p>
                
                <h4>MOTIVE</h4>
                <p>A suspect’s motive for committing the crime should be compelling enough for them to want to break the law or at least act outside norms. Might they inherit a large estate when the victim passes away? Are they trying to keep the victim from revealing a devastating secret? Did they fly into a fit of rage at the mention of some past misdeed?</p>
                
                <p>No criminal acts without a motive, even if the motive has little connection to reality. Money and love are common motives in classic mysteries. Motives might abound in a mystery adventure, and should in a good one. Then, it’s up to the investigators to determine which of the possibilities is strong enough to warrant the perpetrator’s actions.</p>
                
                <h4>OPPORTUNITY</h4>
                <p>A suspect has the opportunity to commit a crime if they could have been at the location of the crime at the correct time. Were they having dinner with a large group of people at the time of the incident? Did they redeem a fare for public transportation in a city hundreds of miles away? Do the security logs show them entering the restricted building before the crime occurred?</p>
                <p>Most perpetrators try to have an alibi for when the crime happened. It’s important for it to seem like they had no opportunity to perform the deed. Investigators need to sort through the alibis to discover which are true.</p>

            <h2>Court of Corvids with QueueTimes, Feb 23, 4:30 p.m</h2>
            <p><i>Court of Corvids</i> is an actual play show that takes place in a homebrew setting using the Pathfinder Second Edition ruleset. It is currently on hiatus having finished its second story arc but will return with a brand new one on Sunday, February 23rd at 4:30 p.m. Pacific.</p>
            <p>In this setting, facts and fiction blur together. In fact, the story began with a lie, one that grew so much it became the central pillar for an entire community…that is until the party stumbled upon the truth and brought it all down. Since then, they’ve been on the road, trying to find their place in a vast world they didn’t even know existed for most of their lives.</p>
            <p>The party, taken through this world by GM and occult enthusiast Jacob Kile, consists of:</p>
            <ul>
            	<li><b>Croog Claudel</b>, played by Croog: A human monk searching for his long-lost siblings, hoping to make amends when he finds them.</li>
                <li><b>Moss the Magnificent</b>, played by Molly McIsaac: An Elven Sorcerer trying to recapture the fame she had back home.</li>
                <li><b>Robyn Way</b>, played by Jonas Newhouse: A Gnome druid desperate to hide from her former life and family. She’s married to Remi.</li>

            <p itemprop="description">A few weeks ago, we posted a blog about the Organized Play Foundation calling for volunteers to assist with Paizo-sponsored conventions.  There are still vacancies for each event, so we thought to amplify the call through our communities. Please take the following information and share with your communities.</p>
            
            <p>Unfortunately, the call for UK Games Expo volunteers got caught up a bit due to the need to integrate GDPR compliance into the established.  Once the edges pull together, the call for that convention will add those listed below.</p>
            
            <p>Each convention provides a graduated benefit scheme for its volunteers.  A list of all the benefits is available on the Organized Play Foundation’s website at <a href="http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/convention-volunteer-information/" target="_blank">www.organizedplayfoundation.org/convention-volunteer-information/</a>.</p>
            
            <p>For general information on any of the events, please reach out to Bob Jonquet, the Premier Event Coordinator, at <a href="mailto:eventteam@organizedplayfoundation.org">eventteam@organizedplayfoundation.org</a>.</p>

            <p itemprop="description">About a month ago, we put out the call for an associate to join the organized play team. Our community heard the request and many folks sent in resumes. Alas, we could only choose one person to join our team. After some deliberation, we asked <b>Alex Speidel</b>, the venture-agent from Cleveland, Ohio. It will take a bit for him to relocate, but we expect to have him join us in Redmond before the end of the month. When he arrives, we’ll have him introduce himself in further detail. But for now, a huge thank you to all those who applied for the position, we appreciate your interest, time and effort expended in applying, and a huge welcome to Alex.</p>
            
            <h2>Regional Venture-Coordinators</h2>
            
            <p>We also have a change coming in the Regional Venture-Coordinator (RVC) ranks. Last August, we had a few of the original RVC team, <b>Bob Jonquet</b> and <b>Del Collins</b>, step back from the role as well as a relocation. <b>Dan Simons</b> moved from Germany to the USA. At that time, it was determined there was a need to rearranging the borders and add several new regions to better serve the organized play community. Looking back, it looks like there wasn’t an announcement of those changes, so we thought this blog the perfect time to rectify my omissions. A fully updated list of the regions appears here and on the Organzied Play website at <a href="http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/organized-play-regions/" target="_blank">www.organizedplayfoundation.org/organized-play-regions/</a>.
            <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
            	<li><b>Dominick Trascritti</b>, VC Tampa, replaced <b>Del</b> as RVC Gulf.</li>
                <li><b>Brent Bowser</b>, lately VC Cincinnati, replaced <b>Bob</b> as RVC Great Lakes.</li>
                <li><b>Nils Janson</b>, VC Rhein Mein, replaced <b>Dan</b> as RVC Central Europe</li>
                <li><b>Benôit Gros, Troy Schnack, Ian Hawthorne, Daniel Flood,</b> and <b>Jack Brown</b> all stepped into RVC roles in new regions.</li>
            </ul>
                
            <p>And now, we must say goodbye to <b>Todd Morgan</b>, as RVC Great Plains, as he moves into a new role organizing the Venture-Officer discord channel. <b>O.J. Pinckert</b>, VC Colorado Springs, agreed to step up to fill the RVC role. We wish Todd the best in his new endeavors and welcome O.J. to the RVC team!</p>    
            
            <p>Huge thank you to all the volunteers! Without their efforts, there would be no Society play. Three cheers for all they do!</p>

        <p>Indra flipped the ship’s comm unit off with an exasperated sigh. Most miners he had flown with over the years were tolerable, even companionable in their own right. But this low-rent job buzzing asteroids for starmetal bits had somehow attracted all the boisterous lowlifes that gave miners a bad name. Indra ignored the uneasy feeling of turning off coms, normally a dangerous proposition even this close to a Star Citadel’s protection. Communication was the real lifeline out here, not the sputtering patrol ship assigned to escort, with its half-functioning gyrolaser turret and a pilot who was barely out of flight school. And certainly not his ship’s mining laser, which took a while just to cut through unmoving asteroid rock.</p>

        <p>But Indra loved the special quiet of a coms-dead ship in space, especially when compared to the current alternative, and he leaned back in his seat to drink it in for a moment. Best not to linger, though; there were plenty of dark, mineral-rich pockets in these rocks that a nest of kaions, dangerous magnetic space squids, would love to call home. Indra pulsed his ship’s thrusters and careened around the nearest asteroid’s rocky surface, eyes sharp for the telltale glint of any of several starmetals.</p>
       
       <p>Soon enough, a dull pulsing crackle began to issue from the ship’s ore-detection system, increasing in intensity as he strafed the skyscraper-sized space rock. “What’d we find, B1? More thasteron dregs?” Indra had noticed he’d started talking to himself more and more lately on these uneventful jobs, maybe a bit too much. So he’d taken to talking to his onboard AI instead, which he’d named after all that was left of its worn serial code. Of course, it couldn’t understand anything beyond basic commands, or even respond—it was, at best, a glorified metal detector—but it made him feel better just the same.</p>
       
       <p>“Oh, my—is that…” Indra trailed off as his scanners confirmed what he could plainly see, a dust-dulled hunk of pale-green crystal. It was a sizable chunk of noqual, and Indra quickly set to work flipping switches and toggles to begin extraction. He expertly guided his ship’s mining laser to carefully etch a frame around the embedded starmetal. Periodically, Indra turned off alarms meant to alert him to nearby magnetic disturbances that might signal the presence of a kaion pod—but that were just as likely to be false positives from the aging ship’s own engines.</p>
       
       <p>A few tense minutes of precise cutting later, the ship shuddered and rattled as its extraction arm ratcheted out, snaking among the recently cut debris toward its prize. This particular deposit was shaped perfectly for the arm’s triple-pronged gripping mechanism, and as the noqual wrenched free, dust bloomed from the pocket, the remaining rock looking somehow even more barren and forlorn.</p>
       
       <p>Just as the hunk of noqual ore reached the deposit basket at the rear of his ship, the asteroid in front of Indra began to glow a dull red, bathed by pulsing emergency lights. Confused, Indra tapped his console—had he accidentally turned them on? Then a cold realization struck him in the stomach and he slammed the comms back on.</p>
       
       <p>“—PIRATES! Turn on your comms, you damned fool!”</p>
       
       <p>Indra wrenched the flight stick, the sudden motion disorienting him and causing the ship to groan and shake, to see their escort fighter dead in space, its emergency lights flashing bright red and its slight frame a tangle of shredded hull and transparent aluminum. The other miners were already halfway back to the Star Citadel, and two sleek and deadly Free Captain ships arced around lazily to face Indra’s virtually defenseless vessel, much closer to him than he was to safety.</p>
       
       <p>Thinking quickly, Indra scanned the pitted surface of the asteroid. There, near a shallow-looking cave, were piles of floating scales, shed from at least a pod of kaions—odds were at least even that they were still in there.</p>
       
       <p>“Well, B1, we don’t have to fly faster than the squids…” A few careful shots from his mining laser into the cavern had the desired effect, setting off a flurry of activity as the tentacled creatures began to silently spew forth from their resting place. “…just faster than those pirates.”</p>

                <p>Wait, what am I thinking? Telling is fine, but it’s way more fun to show you what these pawns can do!</p>
                
                <p>The encounter below is intended for 1st-level Starfinder characters. It takes place on a small, rocky, terrestrial world with a normal atmosphere and standard gravity, though it can easily be set on any world that PCs visit. You can draw a cozy little mud lair for this encounter’s cuddly denizens on any blank battle map, but it fits particularly well in the crater-like terrain in the southeastern quadrant of the front side of <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpya1ae?Starfinder-FlipMat-Asteroid">Starfinder Flip-Mat: Asteroid.</a></p>
                <p>You’ll need the following pawns from the Alien Archive 3 Pawn Collection:

                    	<li>Diatha (2)</li>

        <h3><u>Giggles In The Muck</u></h3>
        	<blockquote>
            <p>The desolate, chalk-white terrain of this rocky planet rises in steep inclines all around, forming a dead-end ravine pockmarked with deep ruts and craters. The air here is crisp and eerily still, though surprisingly breathable to those without environmental protections. A muddy pit burbles at the ravine’s southeasternmost end.</p>
            </blockquote>
            
        	<p>The slopes of this ravine rise abruptly 5 feet into the air. Similarly, the ravine’s ruts dip about 5 feet below the normal ground level. All squares with slopes, ruts, and craters in them are difficult terrain.</p>
            <p>The mud pit at the southeastern end of the ravine is about 1 foot deep and full of thick, viscous mud that a natural underground spring keeps heated to a lukewarm temperature. It’s considered a shallow bog (<i>Starfinder Core Rulebook 398</i>), so it counts as difficult terrain and the DCs of Acrobatics checks attempted in its squares increase by 2.</p>
            <p>When a PC moves within 25 feet of the mud pit, they hear a strange gurgling noise that sounds like someone is being strangled and urgently needs help. The PC can attempt a DC 13 Will saving throw to disbelieve this assumption. If they succeed, they realize the gurgling is an illusory <i>ghost sound</i>.</p>
            <p>Regardless, any PC who moves within 15 feet of the mud pit can attempt a DC 15 Perception check to hear the soft sounds of giggling from a creature lurking in the mud.</p>
            <p>When a PC discovers the illusory nature of the <i>ghost sound</i>, comes within 5 feet of the mud pit, or realizes there are creatures in the pit, the pit’s denizens attack (see Creatures below).</p> 
            <p><b>Creatures</b>: Crouching in the mud is a hobkins gremlin, who thinks they’re very clever to have befriended a small nest of diathas—slug-like creatures whose volatile internal fluids detonate upon contact with the open air. The hobkins gremlin hopes to lure in and then drive away anyone who stumbles into the area, obsessively stealing any equipment that enemies drop and leave behind.</p>

        <hr>
        <p><b>During Combat</b> When combat begins, the gremlin stands up from the mud pit and hovers an inch above the ground using its minor levitation ability, allowing them to ignore difficult terrain. The hobkins then strategically flanks the nearest PC with a diatha, cackling the entire time: “Your shiny techies! Drops them and you will live!”</p>
        <p><b>Morale</b> The hobkins thinks the diathas’ detonate and explosive charge abilities are hilarious, so if a diatha uses either ability, the hobkins can’t help but spend their next move action laughing hysterically at the aftermath. If they are reduced to 3 or fewer Hit Points, the hobkins calms the diathas and tries to surrender, offering the PCs the gold-stitched patches they’ve collected over the past few days (see Treasure below) in exchange for their life.</p>
        <div class="blurbCenter">
			<a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/020720_Diatha_500.jpeg"><img style="max-width:50%"  src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/020720_Diatha_500.jpeg" alt="."/></a>

        </table>
        <p><b>TACTICS</b></p>
        <hr>
        <p><b>During Combat</b> The diathas instinctively try to flank all PCs who threaten them. Whenever a diatha reaches 4 or fewer Hit Points, it uses its explosive charge ability to make a bite attack and then detonate.</p>
        <p><b>Morale</b> The diathas are mindless and thus will fight to the death as long as they are threatened (unless their hobkins calms them).</p>
        
        
        <p><b>Treasure</b>: If the PCs defeat the hobkins and search the mud pit where they were lurking, they can find a small, microcord satchel with a successful DC 15 Perception check. Inside the satchel are a dozen dirty arm patches that bear the symbol of AbadarCorp and a 6-digit number, and are embossed with golden thread. All together, the patches are worth 775 credits.</p>
        <p>If the hobkins gremlin surrendered and gave the PCs the patches to spare their life, the gremlin explains how they found the patches on a group of fallen merchants in a bunker about 3 miles to the south. The scene was picked clean of all other valuables, but this might prompt the PCs to investigate and continue their space adventures!</p>
        <p>If the PCs return these patches to the planet’s AbadarCorp outpost, they’ll learn that the patches belong to members of a fallen merchant expedition that had been bound for the faraway planet of Castrovel. How or why the merchants died is a mystery that the PCs might wish to solve.</p>

            <h2>Starfinder Wednesdays! Attack of the Swarm! The God Host Ascends - Dev Commentary, Feb 12, 4:00-5:00 p.m. Pacific</h2>
            
            <p>Sadly we missed the epic conclusion several weeks ago. But sometimes things take time when you’re preparing for the final mission. And with Attack of the Swarm! The God-Host Ascends being the final installment in the Attack of the Swarm! Adventure Path. We’d like to showcase what unique content is available to players, along with all of the juicey behind the pen look on the epic conclusion of this adventure with developers Ron Lundeen and Jason Keeley.</p>

			<h2>Achievement Points – Pathfinder Society (second edition)</h2>
            <p itemprop="description">The last week saw great progress on the backlog of organized play tasks.  I’ve reviewed resumes for the new Organized Play Associate position, posted a blog with Pathfinder Society (second edition) sanctioning, and made progress on onboarding our venture-officer volunteers from the Organized Play Foundation. There are other tasks, that we aren’t quite ready to reveal, that got crossed off the to-do list.  While not over the hill, we made progress up the slope.</p>
            <p>One of the outstanding tasks I’m working on is the Achievement Point (AcP) system.  We found a few small bugs – GM credit and GM AcP credit are currently linked – and need a few improvements – scaling the amount to accommodate points earned for quests – before we can roll the system out.  We are testing the system and moving the bar forward but are still a few weeks out from implementation.</p>
            
            <p>To bridge the gap and allow players to determine how to spend their points once the system goes live, we decided to release the first round of rewards. We haven’t decided how often to change things, but plan on leaving this in place for a minimum of three months, to give players time to reach their goals. When we do decide to rotate the offerings, we will announce our intentions and give a good amount of time for players to acquire points and purchase. This gap will most likely be a month long, but we will watch feedback once the system goes live and make final decisions then.  As with our other programs, the first rotation or two will be where we work the bugs out and fine tune the processes.</p>

			<h2>Campaign Coins</h2>
			<p>At MarsCon in January, we had the pleasure of recognizing longtime venture-officer <b>Jason Avery</b>, VC New Hampshire, as recipient.  He may now use <b>#827</b>! Huzzah and thank you for your efforts on behalf of the gaming community. </p>
		
			<h2>Novas</h2>
			<p>Congratulations to our first Nova recipients:</p>
            <ul>
            	<li>Gary Norton</li>
                <li>Natalie Kertzner</li>
                <li>Glen Parnell</li>
            </ul>
			<p>As with stars, 5-nova GMs run 150 games, of which 50 are unique scenarios and 10 are interactive events.  They also run at least three evaluation games under the purview of a Venture-Captain, who evaluate the GM using <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/453xdj9oi6ol7ya/5_%20Rubric-publisheddraft.xlsx?dl=0" target="_blank">this rubric</a>. Not a small time committment! Congratulations again to our first ever 5-nova GMs.</p>
			<p>Keep those assessments coming! Venture-Captains, to log evaluation games,  please use <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfQH9FbQtZ1afA5-IqgDG4v-QD262rk_oqKjv9eSsJZnGIGaw/viewform" target="_blank">this form</a> to submit evaluations.</p>


			<h2>Stars</h2>
			<p>We had one GM reached their 5th star in January. Doing so indicates a commitment to organized play, as to achieve this milestone, GMs must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios, as well as run a game for a venture-captain. A conservative estimate of time needed to reach 5-stars is 650 hours! </p>

			<p>Congratulations to <b>Aerine Caerwyn</b> on achieving her 5th star!</p>
            
            <h2>Glyphs</h2>
            <p>I mentioned it under the Achievement Point entry but wanted to note it here as well. We are having issues with the separation of GM Achievement Points and GM table credit. Until we get this issue resolved, counts aren’t accurate.  Once we do get it fixed, we will get the symbol in place and people can start announcing their Glyphs.</p>
		
			<h2>Convention Listing</h2>
			<p>Convention season 2020 is well under way! You can play in Society games at any of the conventions listed below! The list includes all submissions as of 4 February.  If you see one missing, ping the organizer and have them submit a request for support or have them email me at organizedplay@paizo.com to discuss their event. All of the conventions on the list maintain some type of web presence, be it website, social media page, or Warhorn listing, so if you are interested in attending in either capacity, check out their websites or contact the local venture-officer for more information! </p>

I’m Logan Bonner, the new Pathfinder Lead Designer. My job is to see to the health of the game’s ruleset, make sure we’re putting out inspiring new rules for you, and monitor where and how new concepts enter the rules space as the game grows so it stays fresh and exciting, but manageable to understand, run, and play. I’ve been at Paizo for a long while now, with my first big book (as an editor) being Ultimate Equipment. Designing Second Edition with Jason, Mark Seifter, and Stephen Radney-MacFarland was the biggest job in my time here, and the new places we can take the game are really exciting! We want to surprise people and deliver new concepts as well as bringing back the best of Pathfinder First Edition.

Before that, I was in R&D at Wizards of the Coast where I was the lead designer for RoboRally and the BattleTech trading card game, and before that, I was a software engineer at Boeing.  I’m a computer gamer and roleplaying gamer, and in my free time I’m also a Master BBQ Judge for both the PNWBA and KCBS, as well as a fan of port wine.

<div itemprop="articleBody">
	<div class="blurbCenter" style="display: none;"><a href="/image/content/Blog/020320_IdariPreview_500.jpeg"><img src="/image/content/Blog/020320_IdariPreview_500.jpeg"></a></div>
	<blockquote>
		<p itemprop="description">Tynea Halix Gi Satultir sat in a private booth with a one-way window that overlooked the busy high street of Paradise Village and read the latest electronic dispatch from the captain. It was nothing new: an agricultural report stating crop yields were high, an editorial on how the latest Pact Council decision would affect <i>Idari</i> citizens, and an empty promise to crack down on crime in the Red Corridors. Tynea stretched his two upper arms and stirred his drink.</p>
        
        <p>A shadow suddenly loomed over him. Tynea quickly reached for a bandana to cover his mouth but stopped when he heard the voice.</p>
        
        <p>“You know, tradition doesn’t mean you have to visit the same café every single day.”</p>
        
        <p>“I just so happen to like their coffee,” Tynea replied, demurely taking a sip.</p>
        
        <p>The figure took the chair across from him. He was a tall and fit kasatha, his skin a powder blue with dark gray markings running up the side of his head. His black eyes shone with mischief. He ceremoniously removed his fashionable face mask and placed it next to Tynea’s bandana. He tapped a few times on the table’s ordering system, and within moments a server drone brought in a piece of crownberry pie with a dollop of fresh cream.</p>
        
        <p>And though it had been almost a year since Tynea saw him last, Rudim Jinska Viaz Marodi hadn’t changed one bit. </p>

        <p>“You’re back,” Tynea said.</p>

        <p>“I’m back.”</p>

        <p>“For how long?”</p>

        <p>“For now.”</p>

        <p>Tynea felt his cheeks grow hot. “Until the Starfinder Society needs you again, I suppose. And then you’ll disappear for months on end without a single communication, while we—your friends, your family, <i>me</i>—worry ourselves sick.” He downed the rest of his coffee, the nearly scalding liquid a distraction from the lump forming in his throat.</p>

        <p>Rudim looked up from his plate. “Don’t be like this, Tiny. I’m sorr—”</p>

        <p>“Don’t call me that!” Tynea pushed away from the table, snatched up his purple bandana, stood up, and marched out into the crowd.</p>

		</div>
        
        <p>Minutes later, Rudim caught up with him outside of an antique shop, traditional Kasath blades displayed in the window against a velvet backdrop. They caught each other’s glances in the reflection of the transparent aluminum, as Rudim gently placed a hand on Tynea’s shoulder.</p>
        
        <p>“You have every right to be mad at me, Tynea. In fact, if you want to take a swing at me with one of those, you should.” Rudim gestured at a long, serrated sword.</p>
        
        <p>“I’d just as likely cut off one of my own arms,” Tynea mumbled.</p>

        <p>Rudim chuckled and squeezed softly. “I’ve missed you. So much. And I’m sorry for what I’ve put you through.” He reached into one of his pockets and extracted a pair of shining plastic cards embossed with holography. “I know this couldn’t begin to make it up to you, but what are you doing tonight?”</p>

        <p>Tynea turned around. “Are those…?”</p>
        
        <p>"Yup, two tickets to tonight’s Culinarium banquet, the exclusive thrice-annual event where the <i>Idari’s</i> finest experimental chefs showcase their latest recipes!” Rudim puffed out his chest.</p>

        <p>“But how? They always sell out in minutes.”</p>

        <p>Rudim winked. “Being a member of the Starfinder Society has its occasional perks.”</p>

        <p>Tynea’s shoulders fell. “Rudim, be honest. Is this part of some mission?”</p>

        <p>“No! Well… not completely. I just have to ask one of the chefs a few questions about some rumors that she’s been acting a little strangely, and that’s it. The rest of the night will be just for us.”</p>

        <p>Tynea sighed. “Promise?”</p>

        <p>“I promise.”</p>
        
        <hr>
        <br>
        
        <p>“Damn it, Rudim, this is not the night I was expecting!”</p>

        <p>The machine—a 2-foot cube of metal plates, wires, and crystals—shuddered with arcane energy, as Tynea stood before it, panic and confusion in his eyes. Behind him, Rudim struggled against a kasatha chef, grabbing at her apron, which promptly slipped off.</p>

        <p>“Hurry!” Rudim shouted. A bolt of magic arced from the machine and struck a row of kitchen knives attached to two long magnets on the wall, turning them into rock candy. They fell onto the counter and shattered.</p>

        <p>“I don’t know the first thing about magic!” Tynea yelled back.</p>

        <p>“Then just hit it with a frying pan or something!”</p>
        
        <p>“No!” the chef bellowed. Her form then began to melt like ice cream on a hot day. Surprised, Rudim let go and stepped back. The chef’s arms and legs elongated, becoming starfish-like appendages with a single eye on each joint. Her face softened and disappeared, and her voice gurgled from an orifice in her chest. “My masterpiece!”</p>
        
        <p>Tynea had found a large cast iron skillet and raised it over his head. Another shaft of energy lanced out from the device, and Tynea brought the utensil down with a grunt. Pieces of pan-shaped chocolate scattered across the floor. “Damn,” he muttered.</p>

        <p>Meanwhile, Rudim redoubled his efforts to capture the shapeshifting chef. While she was distracted by Tynea, he swept his leg out in a practiced move and sent her tumbling to the floor. Using all four arms, he pinned down most of her tentacles. “Ok, astrazoan, what is this thing? And what did you do with the real Chef Gou?”</p>

        <p>A wet laugh bubbled up from the astrazoan. “There never was a real Gou, you fool. She was always me. And I’ve spent the past decade being overlooked by my so-called betters! But no longer! They’ll see my genius, right before my molecular comestiblizer turns them into piles of pastries! And then I’ll have my sweet revenge!”</p>

        <p>Rudim knocked the astrazoan out with a single punch and stood up. Without looking away from the cabinet he was searching, Tynea said, “I swear, if you say something about ‘just desserts’ right now, I will find another skillet to brain you with.”</p>

        <p>“Why are you taking the fun out of this?”</p>

        <p>“Fun?!” Tynea yelled as an arc of energy transformed a portion of the ceiling into dripping jelly. “You think this is fun?! Aha!” He pulled a roll of shiny foil from the cabinet. “Never mind. Don’t answer that. I have an idea.” Tynea cautiously approached the sputtering cube, and moments later had it wrapped in the material. The device shook one last time and then was quiet. Tynea carefully peeled away a portion of the covering to reveal an elaborately decorated layer cake.</p>

        <p>Rudim chortled. “Reflective foil! Genius!” He warmly embraced Tynea, who finally relaxed.</p>

        <p>“I suppose… that was a little thrilling.” Tynea looked up into Rudim’s eyes. “Perhaps you could teach me that leg sweep?”</p>

        <p>Rudim reached behind Tynea, swiped a finger of icing from the cake, and smeared it onto Tynea’s forehead. “Does that mean you want to do this again?”</p>

         <p>“Maybe,” Tynea said coyly. Wiping the icing from his face, he licked it from his hand and then gagged. “But first let’s get a drink. That might be a cake but it still tastes like metal.”</p>

                <p>Six unlikely heroes must brave untold horrors if they are to save the small town of Trunau from a bland and flavorless future. Do they have the courage to fight for flavor? </p>
                
                <p>Back in November, gamers from around the globe descended on Philadelphia for another amazing PAX Unplugged. Only in its third year, this growing Tabletop Convention offered hundreds of folks a chance to give Pathfinder Second Edition a try! In addition, we put together a special show on the PAX Mainstage Friday night with the cast from the <a href="https://glasscannonpodcast.com/" target="_blank">Glass Cannon Podcast</a> (Troy Lavallee, Joe O’Brien, Skid Maher, Matthew Capodicasa, and Grant Berger). Featuring Paizo Director of Game Design, Jason Bulmahn as Game Master and joined by Paizo Publisher Erik Mona, this live event was filled with daring adventure, ridiculous humor, and an entire side-arc about hunting down orphans?</p>
                
                <p>It was not an event you wanted to miss, but if you did, I have good news for you. The entire adventure was recorded and we have put it up on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/PaizoInc" target="_blank">Paizo YouTube channel</a> for you to enjoy! Give it a watch!</p>
