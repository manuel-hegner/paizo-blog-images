  \  </div> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">It's been an amazing year for Kingmaker,\
  \ which made its digital debut in <a href=\"https://owlcatgames.com/\" target=\"\
  _blank\">Owlcat Games' CRPG adaptation</a> last fall. Many of you have been playing\
  \ through the incredible story and experiencing first-hand the expanded storylines,\
  \ companion interactions, and kingdom-building that the game has brought to life.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The <a href=\"/kingmaker\">Kingmaker Adventure Path</a> debuted 10 years\
  \ ago, and the softcover adventures that make up the epic campaign have long been\
  \ out of print. We've wanted to return to the Stolen Lands in a complete Adventure\
  \ Path hardcover collection, as we did for <a href=\"/riseoftherunelords\">Rise\
  \ of the Runelords</a> and <a href=\"/curseofthecrimsonthrone\">Curse of the Crimson\
  \ Throne</a>, but the question was always one of scope and timing. On the eve of\
  \ Kingmaker's tenth anniversary next year, the timing answer seemed obvious, but\
  \ we still don't know how much additional content to add, especially in the wake\
  \ of the computer game's expansive release.</p> \n     <p>How much new and updated\
  \ content is the right amount? We'll let you decide!</p> \n     <p>Paizo is partnering\
  \ with our friends at Game On Tabletop to launch the Kingmaker Adventure Path for\
  \ Pathfinder Second Edition. We'll start with a hardcover Kingmaker compilation,\
  \ and you'll tell us how much more you want to see. The companions from the computer\
  \ game were also a big hit, so we'll be adding a Companion Guide to introduce them\
  \ to the tabletop campaign, complete with NPC stats, sidequest encounters, and expanded\
  \ kingdom-management roles. Finally, we'll add a hardcover Kingmaker Bestiary for\
  \ 5E, developed in conjunction with industry leaders in third-party 5E publishing,\
  \ allowing players of the current edition of the world's oldest RPG the chance to\
  \ experience the rich and detailed storylines that have made the Kingmaker Adventure\
  \ Path a fan favorite for a decade. More add-ons and unlocks will be revealed as\
  \ the campaign progresses.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderAdventurePath/20190502-Kingmaker.jpg\"\

  \ Tuesday, May 7 at noon Pacific time at <a href=\"http://kingmakercampaign.com\"\

  \ run through midnight on May 21. Until then, tell your friends that the Kingmaker\
  \ Adventure Path is coming to Game on Tabletop next week, and next year to your\
