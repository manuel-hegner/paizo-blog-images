  > \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Last week I spent the latter half of the week\
  \ in Las Vegas on holiday spending my birthday. I appreciated the break and am back,\
  \ rested and refreshed, to continue working on projects. Over the next few months,\
  \ I'm traveling to Book &amp; Board Con in Akron, Ohio, and Extra Life in Spokane,\
  \ Washington. Come out and play!</p> \n    <p>On the Extra Life front, we have plans\
  \ abrewing with Zulu Games in Bothell and Zombie Orpheus Entertainment. Not ready\
  \ to release the particulars yet, but we have a few weeks yet before the November\
  \ 5th event. Keep tuned for more information!</p> \n    <h2>Roleplaying Guild Guide\
  \ Clarifications</h2> \n    <p>Over the past weeks, the team focused on reviewing\
  \ the <em>Roleplaying Guild Guide</em> and clarifying some of the ambiguities our\
  \ industrious players questioned on the forums. There is still work to do, but it\
  \ is progressing and should soon be ready. One answer we came to almost immediately.\
  \ From today, the requirement for character wealth contribution to clear conditions\
  \ when playing pregenerated characters, will only apply to the standard iconic pregenerated\
  \ characters. Any scenario or module that mandates you play a pregenerated character,\
  \ like <a href=\"/products/btpy9mbd\"><em>6-99 Through Maelstrom Rift</em></a> or\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy8j5w\"><em>We Be Goblins!</em></a>, will not require the\
  \ pregenerated character contributions listed in the guide. Refer to the applicable\
  \ sanctioning documents or chronicle sheet for changes to base resolution costs.\
  \ For example, <a href=\"/products/btpy8xc3\"><em>We Be Goblins, Too!</em></a> lists\
  \ the cost to raise as 5 PP. This change is scheduled to appear in the revised version\
  \ of the guide.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb180\">\n     <a href=\"/pfsacg\"><img\

  \    </div> \n    <h2>Adventure Card Guild</h2> \n    <p>We are wrapping up the\
  \ second installment of Season of the Goblin. I hear the pesky creatures cause mayhem\
  \ and madness wherever their cards are found. I'm curious to know—which of the characters\
  \ are your favorite and why?</p> \n    <p>A week from this Wednesday (October 19th),\
  \ the <a href=\"/products/btpy9mbg\"><em>Mummy's Mask Base Set</em></a> for the\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame\">Pathfinder Adventure Card Game</a> releases.\
  \ Progress on the Adventure Card Guild Season of Plundered Tombs continues at a\
  \ madcap pace, the team working to pull edges together. We changed the name of the\
  \ Guild season to differ from the Base Set to emphasize that while Adventure Card\
  \ Guild utilizes the <em>Mummy's Mask Base Set</em>, it is a stand alone story that\
  \ doubles playable content.</p> \n    <h2>Upcoming Conventions</h2> \n    <p>I asked\
  \ some of our convention organizers to put together blurbs about upcoming conventions,\
  \ so that I could share them with other Pathfinders. If you're looking for a vacation\
  \ or are in the local area, consider checking out these upcoming conventions!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>From VC Alison Ooms, coordinator for Winter War:</p> \n    <blockquote>\
  \ \n     <h3>Winter War 44, Jan 27-29, 2017 (<a href=\"http://paizo.com/events/v5748mkg0blzn\"\
  >http://paizo.com/events/v5748mkg0blzn</a>)</h3> \n     <p>We have more than 80\
  \ tables of Pathfinder Society scheduled at Winter War. Board games, war games,\
  \ tabletop gaming of all kinds have been finding a home at Winter War for over 40\
  \ years.</p> \n     <p>Located in Champaign, the heart of Illinois, there are several\
  \ good ways to get to Winter War. Being held at the Hawthorn Suites again this year,\
  \ there is plenty of room for new and returning agents. For information on registering\
  \ to play: <a href=\"http://winterwar.org/\" target=\"_blank\">http://winterwar.org/</a>\
  \ If you would like to volunteer to GM: <a href=\"https://warhorn.net/events/winter-war-44\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">https://warhorn.net/events/winter-war-44</a>. Events will be\
  \ posting soon.</p> \n     <p>Hawthorn Suites<br> 101 Trade Center Dr<br> Champaign,\
  \ IL 61820<br> 217-398-3400</p> \n     <p>For any further information you can contact\
  \ me:<br> Alison Ooms (Venture-Captain—Central Illinois<br> pfs.centralillinois@outlook.com</p>\
  \ \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Or if you're looking for something on the Eastern\
  \ Seaboard of the United States, VC Michael Meunier writes:</p> \n    <blockquote>\
  \ \n     <h3>MarsCon</h3> \n     <p>MarsCon is one of Virginia's largest SciFi/Fantasy\
  \ conventions and is being held this year from <b>January 13th to the 15th</b> in\
  \ beautiful Williamsburg, Virginia. Beyond that, it is also one of the largest gaming\
  \ events in the state and has served at the primary Pathfinder Society convention\
  \ for both the Richmond and Hampton Roads lodges for the past three years. This\
  \ year is particularly interesting as they celebrate the Year of the Dragon (IN\
  \ SPACE!). While it may not be the biggest event, MarsCon has a knack for getting\
  \ some very interesting guests and really entertaining musical groups. What MarsCon\
  \ is really known for though is it's atmosphere as there's a lively party scene\
  \ and a number of laid back events as well as a very well stocked Con Suite. Beyond\
  \ the con there are all the sights, sounds, and shopping that Williamsburg has to\
  \ offer.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Well, back to reviewing the Guide. I hope\
  \ everyone had a great weekend playing Pathfinder and that dice rolled well!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Until next week—Explore, Report, Cooperate!</p> \n    <p>Tonya Woldridge<br>\
