  \ \n    <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">With several\
  \ new changes to improve <a href=\"/pathfindersociety\">Pathfinder Society Organized\
  \ Play</a> on the way over the next several months, one of the things I want to\
  \ do to add to that improvement is feature venture-officers' knowledge about coordinating\
  \ and organizing game days, as well as tips and tricks for all aspects of organized\
  \ play. It's one thing to offer advice from here in Redmond, Washington. It is another\
  \ to offer advice from the field. At least once a month, I hope to feature a blog,\
  \ titled <i>Stories from the Field</i>, that is written by a venture-officer who\
  \ wants to give back to the community through the Pathfinder Society weekly blog.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Dominick Trascritti, the Venture-Lieutenant of Tampa, Florida, has written\
  \ this month's <i>Stories from the Field</i> blog. I reached out to all the VOs,\
  \ and Dominick was one of the first to reply. He does some incredible work in Florida,\
  \ especially by organizing PFS at several large conventons in central Florida each\
  \ year. Thanks Dominick! Below is the article he wrote for the Pathfinder Society\
  \ community.</p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p>The lifeblood of any organized play\
  \ campaign is new players. More players mean there are more opportunities for everyone\
  \ to play. For the good of the community, it is essential we help them avoid an\
  \ uncomfortable start to the Pathfinder Society. This article offers some good practices\
  \ to encourage new players, which in turn work to build a community.</p> \n    \

  ></a>\n       <br>Illustrated by Lydia Schuchmann\n      </div> \n      <p>Organizers,\
  \ game masters, and seasoned players are the face of the campaign for those first\
  \ four to five hours. Each has a role in that first session, and a smart organizer\
  \ will take steps to ensure the player gets a good first campaign experience.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Setting the tone with the organizer, GM, and a few seasoned players\
  \ avoids common mistakes. Don't badmouth other game systems, editions, or groups.\
  \ Keep a positive tone about the community. Represent the hobby well. Everyone on\
  \ that team answers questions or helps the new player find the answer. A player\
  \ who asks questions is more comfortable and engaged.</p> \n      <p>As an organizer\
  \ of a game day or convention, preparation leads to a smooth event. A smart organizer\
  \ is ready for new players at every game session. It is a great idea to set aside\
  \ seats or a whole table just for new players. Always have Pathfinder Society player\
  \ numbers preprinted and a clean printed copy of the <i>Guide to Pathfinder Society\
  \ Organized Play</i> on hand. Organizers should leave nothing to chance for that\
  \ new player's experience.</p> \n      <p>Prepare a binder of the standard pregenerated\
  \ characters for players to use and organize them so that its easy to read and select\
  \ a character. Keep the binder filled with extra copies, and don't forget to have\
  \ flyers for future events inside the front pocket. Using folders that fit inside\
  \ a three ring binder looks good and makes it is easy to use and refill. I don't\
  \ put blank character sheets or inventory forms in the binder. I try to keep it\
  \ simple. Keep an extra set of cheap dice, pencils, and a miniature or two handy\
  \ that you don't mind losing or don't mind giving to new players.</p> \n      <p>At\
  \ the game day, make sure you arrive early. It is important to greet new players\
  \ when they walk in and make them feel welcome. Give them the time to look around,\
  \ ask questions, and receive a seat assignment. Often times a new player is a fish\
  \ out of water, so to speak, so make sure to be considerate of the player's needs\
  \ at what may be an awkward time for them. Learn their name and use it. Be direct,\
  \ and keep it simple.</p> \n      <p>Make sure you give the new player a little\
  \ attention while you seat them at the new player table. The Game Master is the\
  \ second link in the chain. Introduce the table's Game Master and at least one other\
  \ player. Give the new player simple directions and ask them if they need dice or\
  \ a miniature.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurb120\">\n       <a href=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PZO1125-Alahazra.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n       <br>Illustrated by Jason Rainville\n      </div> \n      <p>The GM\
  \ sets the expectations for the player by asking a few questions: what is the player\
  \ looking for in an RPG or who is their favorite movie character. Use this to gently\
  \ suggest a pregenerated character that might favor the new player's interest and\
  \ playstyle. Sometimes new players want to make a new character before or during\
  \ the first session. If there is little or no time to create a new character, explain\
  \ that there are differences in Pathfinder Society and that keeping it simple with\
  \ a pregenerated will start the action faster. Explain the 2nd-level rebuild rule\
  \ and that they can use their own character at the next session.</p> \n      <p>Get\
  \ the new player into the action right away. Explain the basics of the dice and\
  \ character sheet, but save deeper explanations of game mechanics until the player\
  \ needs to know the exact details. It is better to give prompts like \"Roll a d20\
  \ to see if you hit\" or \"Roll a d20 to see if you resist being charmed\" to a\
  \ new player. Give them something to do, and they will feel part of the table. If\
  \ they look frustrated, they are likely not having fun.</p> \n      <p>On the new\
  \ player table, a smart organizer will \"stack the deck\" by including a seasoned\
  \ player at the table to help others learn. This helps the GM focus on the game\
  \ and running the table while ensuring the player has questions answered in a timely\
  \ manner. A smart GM uses the seasoned player to give the new player a little attention.\
  \ A peer who knows the ropes in the game is helpful to everyone and keeps the table\
  \ moving.</p> \n      <p>As the game goes on, the GM should engage every player\
  \ and treat the new person like part of the team. Nothing bores a new player like\
  \ being treated as if they have a practice sword or only the \"marshmallow\" monsters\
  \ attack them. A GM owes it to the player to present a challenge, even if the threat\
  \ is more perceived than real.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurb120\">\n       <a href=\"\

  ></a>\n       <br>Illustrated by Jason Rainville\n      </div> \n      <p>The seasoned\
  \ player can suggest actions for the new player, but let the new player control\
  \ their own character. If they want to do something unusual, explain the consequences.\
  \ Mistakes are great learning experiences. A new player that feels they pull their\
  \ weight in the party often returns to the gaming table. Let the new player enjoy\
  \ belonging as a member of the party.</p> \n      <p>When the game is over, explain\
  \ the tracking sheet and the Chronicle. Give the new player the basics of the new\
  \ character creation in the <i>Guide to Pathfinder Society Organized Play</i>, and\
  \ suggest they use the <i>Core Rulebook</i> to create their own character for the\
  \ second session. Again, make sure to keep it as simple as possible. Explain that\
  \ at the third session they might use any other books they may own that fit the\
  \ theme of their character and are listed on the Additional Resources page. It is\
  \ important to set the expectation that they will have to own books to get fancy\
  \ feats, traits, spells, or any number of other character options. Telling a new\
  \ player that they can use a shiny new character next session is a great selling\
  \ point, so use it!</p> \n      <p>An organizer should talk to the new player after\
  \ the session and chat about the recent game. Make sure to keep the conversation\
  \ friendly, and address the player by name. Encourage them to come to the next game,\
  \ and exchange contact information. Avoid forcing a hard commitment. It is better\
  \ to give them wiggle room and leave a positive impression.</p> \n      <p>One-on-one\
  \ interaction grows the community of Pathfinder Society players. It may be time-consuming\
  \ to prepare and welcome new players, but the invested effort makes the community\
  \ a more welcoming place for newcomers and returning participants alike. The Pathfinder\
  \ Society is not for everyone but everyone is welcome.</p> \n     </blockquote>\
  \ \n     <p>If you have tips and tricks that have worked with recruiting and retaining\
  \ new players, please share those here. As a community, we serve each other best\
  \ when we share ideas and tools that make all of our jobs just a bit easier. Thanks\
  \ again to Dominick for writing the very first of our <i>Stories from the Field</i>\
  \ blogs.</p> \n     <p>Have a very Merry Christmas and a happy new year!</p> \n\
