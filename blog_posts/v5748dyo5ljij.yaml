  \ the distant heat shimmer, the small oasis appeared abandoned, though greenery\
  \ peeked over its walls. Even if the well were dry, it looked like a place Channa\
  \ Ti could find respite in. The cooling shade of the limestone structure could perhaps\
  \ will together enough moisture to fill a canteen or two. As the water druid's camel\
  \ plodded wearily closer, Channa noticed a pair of sphinx statues standing sentinel\
  \ on either side of the gate. The male one turned his head toward her and she caught\
  \ the glint of gold in the sunlight. Not statues, no. Winged leonine humanoids.\
  \ Wearing jewelry. Their swords were long and polished to a mirror gleam. <i>Proud\
  \ then,</i> Channa thought, <i>and dangerous</i>.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Maftets and sphinxes are all about recharging and resetting\
  \ your hand, which can be great… sometimes.</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>The camel grunted\
  \ in complaint as Channa pulled back gently on the reins. A wiser traveler might\
  \ avoid this place altogether, but she was curious about the sphinxlike people.\
  \ Mysterious creatures are rarely hospitable. Approaching slowly was the least she\
  \ could do. With a flash of swift grace and golden feathered wings, the male guardian\
  \ leapt from the wall, swooping down and then rising the moment his bare chest kissed\
  \ the sand. Channa's breath caught in her throat at the stunt. Four heartbeats later,\
  \ she still had not taken a breath when the leonine man landed in front of her.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"State your business here,\" he boomed with a growl from his deep chest.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>She stuttered a moment. \"Ah, I don't know where I'm going.\" The maftet\
  \ scowled at her, raised an eyebrow. \"That is,\" she reassured him, \"I'm looking\
  \ for the Sightless Sphinx.\" And with that, he took to the air. He landed next\
  \ to the other guardian at the wall. They spoke. She could not hear what they said,\
  \ but when the male guard jumped down behind the wall, the female nodded and turned\
  \ to watch Channa warily.</p> \n    <p>Channa waited, biting her lip, while the\
  \ sun reached its zenith. The heat of the day bit into her skin, and the camel chomped\
  \ at the bit, restless. Yet she waited. The guard on the wall had not moved so much\
  \ as a tail flick the entire time. Her armor was beautiful. Crafted from the brilliant\
  \ feathers of the steel ibis, it made it seem that her skin glowed with reflections\
  \ of scattered sunlight. \"Drop your weapons,\" she barked suddenly. Channa froze,\
  \ confused. Nature was her weapon. Then she remembered the blade the Pharasmins\
  \ had gifted her was tied to her belt. It was a ceremonial thing: used to sever\
  \ the connection between mother and child to mark the entrance of a new life into\
  \ the world, for preparing the dead, and for dispatching the undead. Setting the\
  \ blade on the sand, Channa watched as the weapon was consumed in a small torrent\
  \ of dust. The heavy wooden gate creaked open. The male guard appeared in the entrance,\
  \ gesturing her forward.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>That cost, \"shuffle into your location deck,\" shows up elsewhere\
  \ in this adventure, in a big way.</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>Channa tutted the camel\
  \ forward. With the promise of fresh water, it charged, kicking up clouds of sand\
  \ in its wake. She stumbled though the dust and felt something rigid and hot beneath\
  \ her foot. Lightning fast, there was a sickening metallic twang and searing, sharp\
  \ pain as a blade hit her leg. Blood and toxic ichor soaked through her leg wrappings,\
  \ darkening the cloth. She felt the pathways of the lifeblood running through her\
  \ leg, sensed the incursion of poison. It was a simple matter to separate the deadly\
  \ fluid from her veins, but it took all her concentration to cast the protective\
  \ spell. The steel scorpion had her trapped, unable to move. Her eyes darted back\
  \ and forth, desperately seeking someone to help. She found no one. Instead, the\
  \ sands below a scrub tree shook away from a huge arachnid thing. Black metal legs\
  \ skittered toward her, drawn by the smell of blood.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>What if basically everything was made of fire and steel?</i>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>Panic swelled in her chest and her breath became erratic. A\
  \ hot gust hit her back and she felt strong hands encircle her thigh. It was the\
  \ male guard from before. Her heart skipped a beat as the mechanical arachnid reared\
  \ back. Channa tightened her grip on her staff, holding steady the protective spell\
  \ around them both. The bilious venom that sprayed from the construct's mouthparts\
  \ pattered gently like raindrops on their skin. The maftet wrenched the tail of\
  \ the steel scorpion from her flesh. Her leg numb, she collapsed into his arms as\
  \ he stretched his powerful wings, launching them both into the air, away from danger.</p>\
  \ \n    <p style=\"text-align: center;\">∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n    <p>The air inside the tent\
  \ was cool and musky with the scent of fur. The voice of the silver-haired maftet\
  \ tribe elder was gentle. But his eyes shined with suspicion and, if Channa was\
  \ not mistaken, sadness. He would not tell her where the Sightless Sphinx could\
  \ be found.</p> \n    <p>\"Too dangerous,\" he said with a voice edged in regret.\
  \ Outside the tent, a roar of alarm pierced the lazy rattle of cicadas. \"The janni\
  \ must be back. Stay here with the children,\" the elder urged, worry creasing his\
  \ eyes. Instead, Channa threw her bag over her shoulder and followed the elder out\
  \ of the tent. Scaling the oasis wall, she could see a small army of earth elementals\
  \ were moments from reaching the gate. At the head of the horde were two imposing\
  \ janni, one horned and wreathed in fire, the other flint-sharp with footsteps that\
  \ cracked the earth beneath her.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a\
