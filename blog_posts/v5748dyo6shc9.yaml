  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">From the vast reaches of\
  \ space comes an unusual sight: the first volume of the Devastation Ark Adventure\
  \ Path for Starfinder, “<a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq022cf?Starfinder-Adventure-Path-31-Waking-the-Worldseed\"\
  >Waking the Worldseed</a>” by Jenny Jarzabski. This adventure is for 13th-level\
  \ PCs, marking it as our first official foray into higher-level adventure content!\
  \ But what is the Devastation Ark and what does it want with the Pact Worlds? Does\
  \ it spell doom for the system? Or will a group of courageous heroes stop the return\
  \ of an ancient, warmongering civilization?</p> \n     <p>Don’t worry, I’m here\
  \ to give you (some of) the answers. While the spoilers presented here are mild,\
  \ if you want these adventures to complete surprise you, you might want to skip\
  \ some of the more revealing plot-related questions.</p> \n     <p><b>How many volumes\
  \ are in this Adventure Path?</b> The Devastation Ark is a 3-part AP.</p> \n   \
  \  <p><b>What are the other titles and who has written those adventures?</b> The\
  \ second volume of the Devastation Ark is “The Starstone Blockade” by Eleanor Ferron,\
  \ and the third is “Dominion’s End” by Ron Lundeen. </p>\n     <p><b>What levels\
  \ do these adventures cover?</b> “Waking the Worldseed” will take characters to\
  \ 16th level, “The Starstone Blockade” will get PCs to 18th level, and before the\
  \ finale of “Dominion’s End,” the heroes will be 20th level!</p> \n     <p><b>How\
  \ did you plan to fit in all that adventure content?</b> Well, each adventure of\
  \ the Devastation Ark will be approximately 8 pages longer than normal for Starfinder\
  \ Adventure Path volumes. To do this, we had to cut one of each volume’s articles,\
  \ but each volume still contains a new world to explore, a new starship, and a bunch\
  \ of new high-CR aliens!</p> \n     <p><b>Who is this ancient evil? And how are\
  \ they returning?</b> Those who have played through the Dead Suns Adventure Path\
  \ might recognize the builders of the Devastation Ark. Millennia ago, the sivv and\
  \ the kishalee empires were locked in a bloody war that lasted for centuries. The\
  \ sivvs crafted a deadly superweapon—the Stellar Degenerator—to end their hated\
  \ foes, but when kishalee spies eventually captured the device, the sivvs eventually\
  \ lost the war. However, one sivv commandant had little faith in the Stellar Degenerator\
  \ project and headed a project that would allow a collection of sivvs to escape\
  \ destruction by going into stasis aboard a massive colony ship. That vessel, dubbed\
  \ Ark Prime, launched into a kind of “quantum hyperspace” and has spent countless\
  \ ages waiting for the right time to emerge and rebuild the Sivv Dominion!</p> \n\
  \     <p><b>Will there be any tie-ins to other Adventure Paths?</b> Yes! The Devastation\
  \ Ark is designed to be played by any group who has completed any of our other 6-part\
  \ Adventure Paths (or Signal of Screams), with advice for the GM to help bring those\
  \ PCs into the plot.</p> \n     <p><b>The first volume mentions a gazetteer of the\
  \ moon of Hibb. What do the bantrids have to do with this plot?</b> Our little wheeled\
  \ aliens (as seen in the art below) have a mysterious past, having only recently\
  \ awoken from their own stasis with no memory of their history. Without giving too\
  \ much away, bantrids were a servitor species of the Sivv Dominion, and the moon\
  \ of Hibb might involve more than meets the eye.</p> \n     <p><b>Can you preview\
  \ some of the other content?</b> “Waking the Worldseed” features a daemon who represents\
  \ large-scale death by corporate malfeasance, an azata who roots out corruption\
  \ in business and politics, and a ghostly vehicle called a “death cruiser” (yes,\
  \ that’s an updated Pathfinder creature!). “The Starstone Blockade” features an\
  \ article about the Church of Eloritu, one of the more mysterious deities, as well\
  \ as a few more powerful outsiders. “Dominion’s End” features a collection of sivv\
  \ relics and stats for the toughest sivv soldiers and mages.</p> \n     <div class=\"\
