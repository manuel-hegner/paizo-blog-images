  \    </div> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Selik slouched along at the back of\
  \ the party with Boret and the other archers. \"Stupid crusader. Why is he even\
  \ here? We don't need him. Our god has returned and reunited us with the rest of\
  \ the clan.\"</p> \n    <p>Boret grunted. \"Dolok Darkfur is a power, no doubt,\
  \ and without his leadership, we'd still be hiding in the forest. Even so... Ramnos\
  \ has more practical demon-fighting experience than the rest of us put together.\
  \ You'll be glad we have his sword on our side when we storm that keep.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>Their god—a massive, bear-like creature whose bright feathers and intelligent\
  \ eyes made it impossible to mistake him for an ordinary animal—led the group, flanked\
  \ by that irritating crusader and the clan's god-caller, Nelket.</p> \n    <p>Selik\
  \ spat. \"The other crusaders left Sarkoris when the Worldwound closed. I don't\
  \ trust him. Why is he still here? Shouldn't he be riding to the soft southern lands\
  \ with the rest of his people?\"</p> \n    <p>Boret snorted. \"The crusaders only\
  \ turned south because the Whispering Tyrant stirs. Things aren't so soft there.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"But why—\"</p> \n    <p>\"By the Stag Mother's antlers, boy, go\
  \ ask him yourself if you want to know his reasons! The crusader doesn't confide\
  \ in me.\"</p> \n    <p>Selik glared toward the front of the group, his eyes widening\
  \ when the crusader stopped walking until Selik reached him, then fell into step\
  \ beside him. \"I could not help but overhear your question.\" His accent was atrocious.\
  \ \"I remain because I took an oath to cleanse your ancestral lands of the Abyssal\
  \ taint. Some think because the land no longer bleeds demons, our work is done,\
  \ but I disagree.\" He paused. \"Also, I am very good at killing demons.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"Braggart.\"</p> \n    <p>Ramnos laughed, a sound that irritated Selik\
  \ to his marrow. \"I prefer to think of it as clear-eyed self-regard. I know you\
  \ are angry, Selik. I don't blame you. Your people have suffered as much as anyone.\
  \ But I wish your anger wouldn't settle on me. Not all outsiders are invaders. I've\
  \ developed great affection for your people.\"</p> \n    <p>\"You mean for my aunt.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Starting with your aunt, let us say,\" Ramnos agreed.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>\"You'll never be part of the Farheaven Clan,\" Selik muttered. There were\
  \ precious few of his people left, but Selik bristled at the idea of outsiders traveling\
  \ with them, or, gods forbid, marrying in.</p> \n    <p>\"Perhaps not. But—\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"We're here,\" the god-caller said, her voice somehow seeming to whisper\
  \ in Selik's ear. He stepped away from Ramnos, joining the others on a low rise\
  \ that looked down on the grim expanse of Carlhon Keep, once home to men and women,\
  \ now a stronghold of demons, with black clouds swirling unnaturally above its towers\
  \ and walls.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderLostOmens/20190606-BrokenLands.jpg\"\

  ></a> \n     <p>Illustration by Mariusz Gandzel</p>\n    </div> \n    <p>Selik had\
  \ grown up in the forests and fields with members of his clan and had spent barely\
  \ any time under roofs of wood and stone. Carlhon Keep was vast beyond his imaginings.\
  \ Could his people really live there, if they removed the demonic infestation? \"\
  The walls are glowing,\" Selik whispered.</p> \n    <p>\"Demonic runes.\" Ramnos\
  \ sighed. \"Those walls may need to come down entirely. The taint runs deep into\
  \ the stone. The lightning worries me more, though.\" Sick green flashes lit the\
  \ dark clouds.</p> \n    <p>Dolok Darkfur rose, towering on his hind legs, and Selik\
  \ could not deny the stirrings of awe within him. With their god at their head,\
  \ how could they fail? \"I fear no lightning,\" Darkfur said, his voice all rumble\
  \ and strength.</p> \n    <p>\"The rest of us must.\" Ramnos pointed with his sword\
  \ to tiny specks moving among the dark clouds and green flashes of electricity.\
  \ \"Those are wrath demons. Vile things. They do a dance—\"</p> \n    <p>\"They\
  \ dance?\" Selik scoffed. He made a mocking little pirouette.</p> \n    <p>\"Their\
  \ dance brings ruin,\" Ramnos said. \"Few who witness it survive. The demons dance\
  \ not for pleasure, but as a ritual, to call down evil upon their enemies. That\
  \ lightning... I fear the fiends know we are coming, and have begun to dance our\
  \ deaths.\"</p> \n    <p>\"They can't dance if someone bites their legs off,\" Darkfur\
  \ growled, and then rushed forward on all fours toward the keep, Nelket and the\
  \ clan's warriors hurrying after him, swords and hammers drawn.</p> \n    <p>Ramnos\
  \ watched them run. \"It's a good thing we discussed the plan in advance. Ready\
  \ your bow, Selik.\"</p> \n    <p>\"What?\"</p> \n    <p>The crusader pointed again.\
  \ The specks in the air were getting bigger, and a few swooped toward them. Selik\
  \ gasped, fumbled with his bow, and nocked one of the blessed arrows. He was one\
  \ of the best archers in the clan, famed for his ability to shoot birds on the wing,\
  \ but the things coming for them weren't birds—they were a grotesque cross between\
  \ men and vultures, trailing feathers and dust.</p> \n    <p>\"Better if they do\
  \ not come close,\" Ramnos said. \"They spew a poisonous cloud.\"</p> \n    <p>Selik\
  \ took a breath, sighted, and loosed. The arrow sailed true and caught the approaching\
  \ demon in its right wing just as it dove toward Darkfur. The demon spun, its other\
  \ wing clipping the ground, and went down in a sprawl of feathers. The god paused\
  \ briefly over it to deliver a killing blow, and then loped on. \"I got it!\" Selik\
  \ crowed. Other demons fell to the holy arrows loosed by Boret and the other archers,\
  \ and the rest of the demons in the air retreated back toward the keep.</p> \n \
  \   <p>\"They were focused on your god, and didn't consider the rest of you threats\
  \ before,\" Ramnos said. \"Now, they do. Come on!\" He rushed forward, and Selik\
  \ followed, blood singing with something like the thrill of the hunt, but even more\
  \ potent.</p> \n    <p>The archers stopped within bowshot of the walls and loosed\
  \ arrows at the twisted figures on the battlements, protecting the warriors in the\
  \ vanguard. To Selik's annoyance, the crusader stayed by his side, acting as a spotter\
  \ and calling out targets—he seemed to know which demons were the equivalent of\
  \ officers, and once Selik had killed a few of those, the lowlier fiends broke and\
  \ fled.</p> \n    <p>Darkfur reached the keep's gate and rose up, roaring, to slam\
  \ against the barrier. The runes on the walls flared and burned brighter. The warriors\
  \ joined their god, battering the gates with their weapons, but the god was a siege\
  \ engine in his own right, and soon the dark wood began to splinter and crack.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Here.\" The crusader offered Selik a knife—almost big enough to be\
  \ a small sword—with a blade that reflected more light than it should have beneath\
  \ those clouded skies. \"Your bow will be less use inside.\"</p> \n    <p>Selik\
  \ reached out, scowled, paused, then snatched up the weapon. It felt good in his\
  \ hand, thrumming with power. \"Why are you giving me this? Why are you sticking\
  \ so close to me at all?\"</p> \n    <p>\"It is... possible... I told your aunt\
  \ I would look out for you,\" Ramnos said, \"while she and the other warriors stay\
  \ close to your god.\"</p> \n    <p>Selik stomped his foot. \"I am not a child in\
  \ need of a nursemaid!\"</p> \n    <p>Ramnos chuckled another infuriating chuckle.\
  \ \"That is fortunate, as I would make a poor nursemaid. I am, however, a capable\
  \ fighter, and would be honored to stand by your side.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I don't\
  \ need your help,\" Selik said. \"I can find glory on my own!\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  I do not doubt it, but she made me swear an oath.\" He shrugged. \"An oath is an\
  \ oath.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I don't—\"</p> \n    <p>The crusader suddenly shouted and\
  \ shoved Selik aside as a vulture demon leapt down on them from the battlements.\
  \ The crusader and the demon went down in a jumble of limbs and feathers, claws\
  \ and blades, and Selik froze. Shooting arrows at distant shapes was one thing,\
  \ but now the demon was here, at his feet, stinking and writhing and vile and terrifying.\
  \ He froze for a long moment, then looked around for help, but the rest of the clan\
  \ was disappearing into a crack in the gates.</p> \n    <p>Selik shook himself,\
  \ raised his new blade, and waited for his moment. When he was sure he wouldn't\
  \ hit Ramnos by mistake, he struck, plunging his blade into the back of the demon's\
  \ birdlike head. It screamed, the wound smoking, and Ramnos rolled out from under\
  \ and struggled to his feet. The crusader plunged his sword through the monster's\
  \ back, ending its shrieks. He plucked a moldy feather from his hair and rubbed\
  \ at a long scratch on his cheek, but smiled. \"You see? You are the one looking\
  \ after me.\"</p> \n    <p>Selik nodded. \"That's right. You're... lucky I was here.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"I never could take care of myself alone. That is why I joined an\
  \ order of knights in the first place.\" Ramnos nodded toward the cracked gates.\
  \ \"Shall we teach these demons to dance properly?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Dancing is soft,\"\
  \ Selik muttered, but he followed Ramnos into the keep as lightning began to lance\
  \ down from the clouds all around.</p> \n    <p>The crusader's answering laughter\
  \ somehow annoyed him less this time.</p> \n    <p>Tim Pratt<br> <i>Contributing\
