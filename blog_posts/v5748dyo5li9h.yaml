  \ itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">We've been admittedly\
  \ pretty quiet since we showed the game at Gen Con and then PAX back in August.\
  \ There's been a fair bit of speculation about it. So I guess first I'll clear some\
  \ stuff up.</p> \n    <p>We won't be releasing the game in fall 2015... and that's\
  \ a good thing!</p> \n    <p>Time for context!</p> \n    <p>Back when we started\
  \ this project, I worked out the scope of the game with the execs at Obsidian. André\
  \ Nguyen created a great mockup of gameplay in Flash that helped get everyone at\
  \ Obsidian and at Paizo on board (I may share some screens from that version at\
  \ some point). We agreed on a pretty limited set of features to begin with—enough\
  \ so that you could play through the Base deck of <em>Rise of the Runelords</em>.\
  \ I knew a three-scenario game would be enough to prove the game out, but not enough\
  \ to bring to market. As development continued and our confidence in the product\
  \ grew, we kept building upon what we had piece by piece, carefully increasing the\
  \ scope over time. With each additional piece, we added a lot more content and improved\
  \ presentation—well beyond our original plans.</p> \n    <p>So that brings us up\
  \ to today, and more importantly, a release date that we're moving to early 2016.\
  \ Why is that a good thing?</p> \n    <p>Well, behind the scenes at Obsidian, we\
  \ are now planning a better, stronger launch than ever before. And I gotta tell\
  \ you, I'm excited! There are so many cool things in the works, including some that\
  \ will let you experience the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game in new ways. First,\
  \ there's this cool new...</p> \n    <p class=\"tiny\"><i>Feargus (CEO, Obsidian\
  \ Entertainment): Davis! Not yet!</i></p> \n    <p>Ah, right. There's a whole plan\
  \ for talking about this.</p> \n    <p>In the meantime, I think there are some new\
  \ things I can \"leak.\"</p> \n    <p>We've been working closely with Paizo and\
  \ Lone Shark to make this game as awesome as possible. In most cases, that means\
  \ staying true to the original rules and intent. There are times where the limitations\
  \ of interface (over a tabletop) mean it's better if we change the mechanics of\
  \ the card to fit our game. A simple example of this comes from the \"Cloud\" spells.</p>\

  \     <br> <i>\"Don't you know that you're toxic?\" ...yep, the card game blog got\
  \ a Britney reference.</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>From a mechanics perspective, we\
  \ removed the \"when a character encounters\" part of the spell and made it work\
  \ more like other displayed spells such as Strength and Glibness. It’s a minor change\
  \ in functionality, but a large benefit for our interface: instead of stopping gameplay\
  \ whenever a bane is encountered in order to see if the character with this spell\
  \ wants to play it, it’s now available before or after an exploration or on a combat\
  \ check. You’ll also notice that we've made some changes to the card layout; for\
  \ the most part, we've done this to give the card art a bit more room. We also introduced\
  \ icons for the different card types, as there are places where our user interface\
  \ really benefits from that. And Paizo has updated the wording where appropriate.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The folks at Paizo have also given us opportunities to add cards here\
  \ and there that are unique to the digital game. Here are some of my favorites so\
  \ far:</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20151124-ChainMail.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Rusted Chain doesn't care about your armor proficiency.</i>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>The original game has a lot of standard chain mail. We switched\
  \ out some of them with minor mechanical changes and art revisions. As you know\
  \ from playing the game, anything that adds to the thrill of discovery is a good\
  \ thing.</p> \n    <p>And speaking of thrilling, our artist, Lindsey Laney, was\
  \ inspired to create the art for a new card in her free time. I can only describe\
  \ it as a move for gender equality.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\
