  \ check out the <a href=\"/rpgsuperstar/round4\">RPG Superstar Top 8's entries</a>\
  \ and vote for your favorites. This round will determine our Top 4, who will submit\
  \ their own adventure pitches for the final round. The ultimate winner and <a href=\"\
  /rpgsuperstar\">RPG Superstar</a> will be determined out of these Top 4, who will\
  \ earn a contract to write their own adventure for our <a href=\"/pathfinder/modules\"\
  >Pathfinder Modules</a> line!</p> \n    <p>As with every round this year, we set\
  \ the bar just a little higher with the Round 4 requirements. The contestants had\
  \ to manage to provide an encounter with our tightest word count restrictions ever,\
  \ along with using a monster from a previous round and adding a trap, and then setting\
  \ the whole thing in Nar-Voth. They also had to produce their second map for the\
  \ contest, placing an additional set of design requirements into the same deadline\
  \ as their writing. All the contestants did a great job creating interesting and\
  \ creative encounters that fit the bill, and now it's up to the community to decide\
  \ who did it the best!</p> \n    <p>The contestants that move on to the last round\
  \ have just one more design challenge to face, so I encourage everyone to take the\
  \ time to look at their entries this round and decide who you think will write the\
  \ best adventure to enter the canon of Golarion. To help make that as close to an\
  \ apples-to-apples comparison as possible, I'll preview a little of the rules for\
  \ the upcoming last round:</p> \n    <p>The contestants' final challenge will be\
  \ to create pitches for an adventure set in Nar-Voth for 5th level characters. This\
  \ will allow the Final 4 to get the greatest benefit of the research and design\
  \ they've already done for the last 2 rounds, freeing them to take their time and\
  \ focus on their writing.</p> \n    <p>Also, we are very excited to announce that\
  \ some of our Top 8 will be featured in a <a href=\"http://knowdirectionpodcast.com\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Know Direction</a> podcast this weekend! Be sure to mark your\
  \ calendar for this Saturday, February 28, at 5:30 PM Pacific time.</p> \n    <p>The\
  \ community is a huge part of what makes this contest such a big success and we\
  \ thank you! Go ahead and vote and help us determine our next <a href=\"/rpgsuperstar\"\
