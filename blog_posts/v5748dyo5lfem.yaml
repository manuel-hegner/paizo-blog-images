  \   <p class=\"date\">by Gabrielle Harbowy</p> \n   <h2>Chapter Two: Adventure</h2>\
  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">Zae\
  \ took care of cleaning Keren's home and procuring supplies for the journey, while\
  \ Keren trained Appleslayer to be a riding hound. In just a few busy days, bags\
  \ were packed, and homes and infirmary were closed up. Keren secured permission\
  \ to ride along with a party of crusaders patrolling the Virlych border. Zae had\
  \ wanted to strike out on their own and \"rough it\" through the Hungry Mountains,\
  \ just the two of them, but Keren had been resolutely against that plan. It was\
  \ just as exciting, Zae conceded, to be riding with a squadron of five knights.\
  \ It certainly made her sit up straighter in her borrowed white-and-gold military\
  \ saddle.</span></p> \n    <p>In short order, it became obvious that Appleslayer\
  \ had been trained to ride with cavalry and showed no fear of horses. A few days\
  \ of Keren's expert care groomed the big white dog into a pleasant and eager mount.\
  \ Apple had obeyed her, but his devotion was to the little gnome who had healed\
  \ him. They rode alongside Keren and her white war steed, Eridem, like a study in\
  \ forced perspective.</p> \n    <p>The pace felt easy, but productive. Every few\
  \ miles, they passed guard sentries in the white-and-gold armor of Ozem or the more\
  \ mundane livery of the regular Lastwall military. That meant they were still skirting\
  \ Virlych, where the Whispering Tyrant lay. Each time, the knights nodded to the\
  \ sentries and exchanged some meaningless pleasantry, and each time the soldiers\
  \ nodded back. </p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500_Appleslayer.jpg\"\

  0\"></a>\n     <br>Appleslayer is a fine steed.\n    </div> \n    <p>For a time,\
  \ they kept the Path River between themselves and Virlych. Adian, the knight in\
  \ the lead, called a halt to water the horses just as it turned west and dwindled\
  \ to modest tributary, easily crossed on horseback—or dogback.</p> \n    <p>\"So...\
  \ where are we actually headed?\" Zae was glad of a chance to have a rest from the\
  \ saddle and stretch her legs. \"You know where Ennis was going, but that was how\
  \ long ago? Can you be sure he actually arrived there?\"</p> \n    <p>\"He sent\
  \ messages to me and Father about a year ago—a sort of peace offering, which Father\
  \ rejected.\" Keren took a breath as if was about to say more, then shook her head\
  \ and lapsed into silence.</p> \n    <p>Zae clicked her bronze lip ring against\
  \ her teeth. \"Mm. Then you know he got to the Worldwound. That's a start.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Maybe.\" Keren sounded surprisingly noncommittal. </p> \n    <p>\"\
  Are you afraid that he's dead, too?\" Zae asked.</p> \n    <p>\"I've heard tales\
  \ of the Worldwound. Some of the strongest, bravest crusaders I've known have come\
  \ back limp and skittish as week-old cats, jumping at their own shadows and dreading\
  \ the things they see behind their eyelids in the dark. Am I afraid he's dead? No.\
  \ It'd be a kindness to him if he is.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Well, soon we'll have those\
  \ stories,\" Zae said.</p> \n    <p>Keren shook her head and sighed. \"Is this all\
  \ so exciting to you? As much as you yearn for the new, I would think you'd have\
  \ seen the world twice over by now.\"</p> \n    <p>Zae narrowed her eyes, peering\
  \ past the company of knights and off toward Gallowspire. She wondered what the\
  \ ruins looked like, and how sturdy the locks on the Tyrant's prison really were.\
  \ \"Oh, I certainly hope I never get to the point where I've seen the world twice\
  \ over. Then there'd be nothing new to see. You know, I've never even been to the\
  \ Eye of Abendego.\"</p> \n    <p>Keren gave her a sidewise glance. \"Why would\
  \ you want to go there?\"</p> \n    <p>Zae shrugged. \"To be honest, I'm not even\
  \ sure what it is. I've just heard people say it and think it's an excellently fun\
  \ word. Abendego!\" Appleslayer perked his ears and barked.</p> \n    <p>\"Good\
  \ boy,\" Zae said, but then the bark turned into a whine and a low growl. </p> \n\
  \    <p>Adian and Marisol, a sorceress in white and gold leather, were already mounted\
  \ again. \"The horses sense it, too,\" Adian said quietly, and all the soldiers\
  \ drew their weapons. Zae traced a finger around the tooled gear she wore at her\
  \ throat. </p> \n    <p>Unfolding from the barren ground were five beige figures—\
  skeletons, Zae realized, their bones the color of the dirt, slumbering at the base\
  \ of the mountains that led to the Tyrant's tomb. </p> \n    <p>Keren swung herself\
  \ up onto Eridem, but Zae remained on foot with the other knights. She drew her\
  \ hammer from her belt and whispered a prayer to Brigh. Just as a collection of\
  \ gears with no motor shouldn't run, a skeleton was a collection of bones with no\
  \ heart or mind. If it did have a mind, Zae thought, it would have the good sense\
  \ to remain a motionless pile of parts... especially in the presence of six holy\
  \ crusaders.</p> \n    <p>A few dirty scraps of cloth and broken weapons were all\
  \ that signified the people the skeletons might have been in life. They moved as\
  \ one but with no particular group mind, only individual focus on the same goal.\
  \ The knights, on the contrary, were skilled at group tactics. With just a few hand\
  \ signals, they took to a practiced formation, each focusing on a specific enemy.\
  \ </p> \n    <p>Zae mostly healed from her shopfront infirmary in town—healing on\
  \ the front lines was an honor usually reserved for the paladins and battle clerics\
  \ of Iomedae and other gods—so the knights' fluid battle tactics were a foreign\
  \ and beautiful dance to her. It made her proud to see Keren a seamless cog in the\
  \ crusaders' workings, singling out a skeleton with a shouted challenge and lopping\
  \ half of it away with her first charge. Zae called upon Brigh's holy light, and\
  \ a wave of energy blasted the skeleton, overpowering the dark force that animated\
  \ it.</p> \n    <p>The gnome let out a gleeful shout, and two of the other skeletons\
  \ altered their approach, turning toward the sound of her voice. </p> \n    <p>\"\
  Oops,\" she muttered, but Adian and the sorceress were already upon them, and both\
  \ were slain before they could reach her. Zae shot Adian an apologetic look when\
  \ he thundered by on his mount, preparing for another pass at one of the remaining\
  \ foes, but secretly she was disappointed to have lost her chance to strike again.\
  \ By the time she was in range of Keren's skeletal target, it was legless and almost\
  \ sad, flailing its arms and fruitlessly clacking its jaw. She brought her holy\
  \ light down upon it, just to make the noise stop.</p> \n    <p>A good thing about\
  \ fighting skeletons, it turned out, was that they made for relatively bloodless\
  \ battle. Apple paced around Zae, whimpering. At first she thought he had somehow\
  \ been injured, but when she stopped him and ran her hands over his coat, she realized\
  \ his tail was wagging expectantly. </p> \n    <p>\"Okay, boy, go ahead.\" </p>\
  \ \n    <p>He darted into the rubble that had been their attackers. The dog shifted\
  \ bones with his muzzle, finally picking out a relatively whole forearm. He trotted\
  \ back proudly with it and settled down at Zae's feet to gnaw. </p> \n    <p>\"\
  We're going into Witchgate Forest, but we can part ways at the tree line and you\
  \ can skirt around, if you'd like,\" Marisol said. \"Don't get too sure of yourselves,\
  \ though. Only reason we took out five so fast is that we outnumbered them. It'll\
  \ be a different game when it's only the two of you.\"</p> \n    <p>Zae and Keren\
  \ exchanged a look, and Zae dipped her head in a slight, canted nod. It was Keren's\
  \ quest, so the choice was hers. </p> \n    <p>Keren turned her palm up, tracing\
  \ the Vigilant's shield marked there with her other hand, the way she did when she\
  \ was of two minds about something. \"It's important for me to get to the Worldwound,\
  \ but I've sworn oaths to protect these lands. Even though I haven't been assigned\
  \ with this patrol, I want to stay and honor my oath.\"</p> \n    <p>Zae's chest\
  \ swelled with pride. She turned over her own palm, which bore a similar shield.\
  \ She only had the one mark, proclaiming her an oathbound citizen of Lastwall; Keren\
  \ and the others had Iomedae's symbol on their other palms, the sunburst sword signifying\
  \ that they were also sworn defenders. </p> \n    <p>Witchgate Forest itself was\
  \ something of a letdown. Zae saw cultists and orcs, skeletons and shambling, oozing\
  \ things—all of which she and the knights duly put to rest—but no witches and no\
  \ gates. When she asked if they might detour past one of the infamous gates, the\
  \ request was soundly denied. </p> \n    <p>Though it was early morning, the forest\
  \ was dark and foreboding, with only the occasional shaft of dusty light peering\
  \ through the branches. \"Hangman Trees over there,\" Adian said, pointing with\
  \ his drawn longsword. He led the company off the well-groomed path and onto a side\
  \ path that had initially looked less inviting.</p> \n    <p>\"I suppose you patrol\
  \ through here enough to know the landmarks,\" Zae said to Marisol.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Indeed. We've tried to take the grove out, but they just grow back. Easier to avoid\
  \ them, now.\"</p> \n    <p>\"That's why no one wants to divert past a witchgate?\"\
  \ she surmised, and was pleased with herself when Marisol nodded. </p> \n    <p>\"\
  No sense weakening ourselves on the flora when we should be saving our resources\
  \ for real threats.\" </p> \n    <p>It made sense. Zae was grudgingly glad to have\
  \ experienced guides, even if it meant fewer chances to sightsee. She was still\
  \ just a bit grumbly about not having seen a witch or a gate, and she resolved to\
  \ make up for it by cantering toward the first wall she should happen to see in\
  \ Canterwall. </p> \n    <p>They made camp in the forest that night, with soldiers\
  \ standing guard against the shriekings and moanings. It was oddly disappointing\
  \ to pass out of the forest the next day and into the relative safety of the fertile\
  \ plains. They would part ways with their escort and ride north through farmland\
  \ and rolling hills to the Vistear River, while the crusaders continued their patrol\
  \ along the northern Virlych border. </p> \n    <p>The knights clasped hands with\
  \ Keren, one by one, and then, to Zae's surprise, Adian extended his hand to her.\
  \ She clasped it, shield to shield, and that seemed to please him; the others followed,\
  \ exchanging handclasps and warm words of parting. </p> \n    <p>\"Nice to see you\
  \ getting along with my friends so well,\" Keren teased her as they rode away. </p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"I don't know... it's a big step for us,\" Zae said, playing along.\
  \ \"First we get a dog, then I meet your friends... Maybe I'll get to meet your\
  \ family next?\"</p> \n    <p>Keren laughed, her shoulders visibly releasing tension.\
  \ \"That's the plan.\"</p> \n    <p>Gently but more seriously, Zae asked, \"So,\
  \ where do we start? That's a long, creepy border up there.\"</p> \n    <p>Keren\
  \ touched her fingers to her key medallion. \"I was thinking of volunteering at\
  \ the first outpost we come across once we hit the front lines, and then asking\
  \ around.\"</p> \n    <p>Zae didn't realize her lip ring was clicking against her\
  \ teeth until Keren gave her the stern \"stop that\" look. \"I was just thinking...\
  \ We've got a ride up a river between now and then, right? How long do you think\
  \ that'll take?\"</p> \n    <p>Keren shrugged her nearer shoulder. \"I don't know.\
  \ I've never done it. A couple of days? Why?\"</p> \n    <p>Zae rubbed her hands\
  \ together. \"Give me a couple of hours to poke around for supplies in the next\
  \ town, and I should have something useful for you by the time we disembark.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Keren eyed her warily. \"It's not going to be something that explodes,\
  \ is it?\"</p> \n    <p>Zae straightened in the saddle and responded with a haughty\
  \ sniff. \"Presumptions! Cruel racial presumptions! When have you ever seen anything\
  \ explode because of me?\"</p> \n    <p>Keren tilted her head in thought. If Zae\
  \ squinted, she could almost picture Eridem's rhythmic hoofbeats as the ticking\
  \ of gears turning in Keren's mind. </p> \n    <p>\"Dog guts all over my kitchen?\"\
  \ she ventured.</p> \n    <p>Zae patted Appleslayer's neck. \"Don't listen to her.\
  \ Your guts never left your body.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Well, there was that one time\
  \ when you tried to cook me dinner...\"</p> \n    <p>Zae huffed, trying to hide\
  \ her grin by lifting her chin and looking away in high dudgeon. \"Pfff. Cheater.\
  \ You know very well that's not the kind of explosion I meant!\"</p> \n    <p align=\"\
