  \    </div> \n    <h1>Pathfinder Battles Preview: A Last Look at Heroes &amp; Monsters</h1>\
  \ \n    <p class=\"date\">Friday, January 13, 2012</p> \n    <p>The first set of\
  \ Pathfinder Battles prepainted miniatures, <a href=\"/-btpy8mq6\">Heroes &amp;\
  \ Monsters</a>, formally released this Wednesday. Many of you probably already have\
  \ your miniatures, or are eagerly anticipating their arrival. Looking over the previews\
  \ we’ve posted over the last few months, there are still a few minis we haven’t\
  \ yet shown off in their final form, so if you’ll indulge me, I’d like to take one\
  \ more pass through this first set before revealing the goods on the next set, which\
  \ will support the <a href=\"/products/btpy8mqq\"><i>Rise of the Runelords Adventure\
  \ Path</i></a>.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/011312-Orc_360.jpeg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/011312-Orc_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div>\
  \ \n    <p><a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lczm\">Last week</a>, I went through final\
  \ images of several of the monsters from the set, but I managed to miss the nasty\
  \ Orc Brute, which is actually one of my personal favorite figures from the set.\
  \ I’m astounded by the detail WizKids got into the commons in this set, and this\
  \ guy is no exception. As an aside, some folks have asked me about the names of\
  \ some of these figures. I decided to call this guy an “Orc Brute” because he looked\
  \ bulkier than the Orc Warrior. If you’re looking to emulate this figure with Pathfinder\
  \ stats, I suggest adding the advanced simple template to the orc warrior and swapping\
  \ his weapon to a club. Voila! </p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\
  /image/content/Blog/011312-CityGuard2_360.jpeg\"><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/011312-CityGuard2_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Speaking of commons, I’m quite pleased\
  \ with how the Watch Guard turned out. His lantern lights the way through dark city\
  \ streets, and he’s sure to come running 3d6 rounds after your player characters\
  \ scream out for his help. </p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\
  /image/content/Blog/011312-CityGuard1_360.jpeg\"><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/011312-CityGuard1_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>This common Watch Officer started out life\
  \ as a Watch Captain, but I didn’t quite feel that his pose sold the “awesomeness”\
  \ of a captain, so I busted him down a rank or two. I do hope to get a genuine Watch\
  \ Captain into the line at some point. When that happens, you can expect him (or\
  \ her!) to share the same color scheme and costume details of these two watch figures.\
  \ Making “like” creatures look alike is a big goal for Pathfinder Battles, and one\
  \ I hope we can continue to build on in future sets.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/011312-HumanRogue_360.jpeg\"><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/011312-HumanRogue_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>This “hero” doubles quite nicely for a\
  \ villain, since he looks like he’s about to emerge from his hiding place in the\
  \ shadows to stab you in the back. We call him the Human Rogue, and whether you\
  \ use him as a player character or a common thug, he definitely comes with the right\
  \ tool for the job.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/011312-Druid_360.jpeg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/011312-Druid_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div>\
  \ \n    <p>Is the item in the hands of this uncommon Human Druid a bedroll? A really\
  \ big scroll? I’m honestly not sure, even today, but I do think she looks pretty\
  \ nifty. This figure doubles nicely as a noncombatant townsfolk or tribal character,\
  \ though those blue crystals hanging from her belt have got to be worth something!</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/011312-ElfWizard_360.jpeg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/011312-ElfWizard_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>The uncommon Elf Wizard is captured in the act of casting a\
  \ spell. The figure features a neat color gradient on the skirt of the robes that\
  \ gives it a nice texture effect.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a\
  \ href=\"/image/content/Blog/011312-DwarfFighter_360.jpeg\"><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/011312-DwarfFighter_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>The uncommon Dwarf Fighter is pulled from\
  \ the back cover of the <a href=\"/products/btpy8ief\"><i>Inner Sea World Guide</i></a>,\
  \ making him a sneaky actual Pathfinder NPC masquerading as a simple player character\
  \ figure. Don’t tell the high court of the Five Kings Mountains, but High King Borogrim\
  \ the Hale has been slumming it!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a\
  \ href=\"/image/content/Blog/011312-Cleric_360.jpeg\"><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/011312-Cleric_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>This uncommon Half-Elf Cleric worships\
  \ the crusader goddess Iomedae, and comes complete with a holy symbol and a cool\
  \ graphic on her tabard. She also works great as a paladin or fighter, depending\
  \ on your mood. Just don’t make fun of her bowl haircut. I hear she’s pretty touchy\
  \ about that subject!</p> \n    <p>And that’s it! Looks like my art team forgot\
  \ to take a picture of the Human Ranger (one of my favorites in the set), so I guess\
  \ next week we’ll just show a picture of him and put off the Runelords previews\
  \ again.</p> \n    <p>JUST KIDDING!</p> \n    <p>We’ll add him as a special bonus\
  \ image to next week’s blog, which I promise is going to melt your brains with awesomeness.\
  \ I can’t believe how great these Runelords minis look! Best of all, we’ve photographed\
  \ paint masters of almost the entire set, so we should be able to jump right into\
  \ the good stuff immediately.</p> \n    <p>That’s not too difficult, because as\
  \ far as Rise of the Runelords is concerned, it’s all good stuff!</p> \n    <p>I\
  \ hope you’ve enjoyed these <a href=\"/-btpy8mq6\">Heroes &amp; Monsters</a> previews.\
  \ We’ve now posted <a href=\"/store/byCompany/w/wizKids/byProductType/pathfinderMiniatures/pathfinderBattlesHeroesMonstersSingles\"\
  > singles for sale</a> to help you complete your sets (don’t forget that case subscribers\
  \ get a discount on singles orders!). If you haven’t yet placed your Heroes &amp;\
  \ Monsters case or brick orders, I suggest doing so soon. These minis are moving\
  \ much faster than we anticipated, and they will not be around forever!</p> \n \
  \   <p>See you next week!</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p> \n   </blockquote>\
