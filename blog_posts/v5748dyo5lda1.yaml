  \ class=\"PTales\"></div></a> \n    <h1>Krunzle the Quick</h1> \n    <p>by Hugh\
  \ Matthews</p> \n    <h2>Chapter Five: A Diversion</h2> \n    <p>\"Hurt a little?\"\
  \ Krunzle began. \"Then perhaps we could—\" He was unable to continue because his\
  \ senses were now reporting that his insides and outsides had apparently changed\
  \ places, and that his entire carcass had subsequently been consumed by a raging\
  \ firestorm wrapped in a freezing blizzard, then crushed to the size of an ant—\
  and not a very big ant, at that.</p> \n    <p>He was next conscious of screaming\
  \ hoarsely, and then vision returned, along with the rest of his sensorium, which\
  \ advised him that all his systems were now running normally—except for his fear-measuring\
  \ capacity, which was strained to its limit. He closed his mouth and took in a long,\
  \ shaky breath through his nostrils. \"Please,\" he said, \"don't do that again.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Typical,\" said the woman. \"I free you from a serious enchantment—\
  a service, I want to point out, that I perform at no charge. And do I see gratitude?\
  \ Do I hear so much as a murmur of thanks?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Thank you,\" Krunzle\
  \ murmured.</p> \n    <p>\"Too late now,\" she said, picking up the knucklebones\
  \ and rolling them expertly between her palms. \"Now let's see what you can do for\
  \ me in return.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I thought you said there was no charge.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"Typical,\" she said again, shaking her blonde locks. She threw the bones\
  \ onto the tabletop, regarded them for a long moment, then said, \"Apparently, the\
  \ answer is: nothing. You're not part of my future at all.\"</p> \n    <p>Krunzle\
  \ heaved a sigh of relief, until the thought occurred that the bones might be saying\
  \ he was not part of anybody's future. The demon worshipers next door could likely\
  \ use a spare body. And he knew that some of the uses to which the bodies were put\
  \ rendered them useless for any future employment.</p> \n    <p>She had picked up\
  \ the amulet again. \"So he sends in a thief to steal this piece of gimcrack, which\
  \ the idiot Didmus gave to the equal idiotic Galathea as some sort of mawkish love-token.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Krunzle dared to interrupt. \"Who,\" he said, \"are Didmus and Galathea?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Again, that look that his teachers used to give him, then she shook\
  \ her head as one does who accepts that some shortcomings must be borne with. She\
  \ said, \"Galathea is the girl from whom you took the apprentice's eye. She is my\
  \ daughter. And Baalariot's, for that matter. Didmus is a half-grown half-wit of\
  \ a sorcerer's apprentice. They think they are in love.\"</p> \n    <p>\"You and\
  \ Baalariot are married?\" he said.</p> \n    <p>Again, the look of disbelief. \"\
  Men and women do not have to be married to produce children,\" she said. \"Baalariot\
  \ wants to wed her to one of Hedvand's courtiers. I have a better plan: she will\
  \ train to become a priestess of Nocticula, cementing my relationship with the cult.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"And Didmus,\" the thief said, his mind beginning to form the picture\
  \ into whose frame he had been pressed, \"what does he want?\"</p> \n    <p>She\
  \ assumed an exasperated look. \"What does any young man want?\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  He doesn't happen,\" Krunzle said, \"to play the zither?\"</p> \n    <p>\"I wouldn't\
  \ put it past him.\"</p> \n    <p>For all its academic shortfalls, Krunzle's intellect\
  \ was adept at plans and schemes, his own and others'. The pieces now fell into\
  \ place. He debated for a moment as to whether he should voice his conclusions—\
  but only for a moment. If he was right, events would shortly reveal the facts for\
  \ themselves, and he would gain nothing by too late a revelation.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  I believe,\" he said, \"that I am here as a diversion.\"</p> \n    <p>Hortenza's\
  \ brows consulted each other, then her eyes widened. She opened her mouth to speak,\
  \ but at that moment a heavy concussion sounded from downstairs. The building shook,\
  \ and shards of plaster sifted down from the hole in the corner of the ceiling.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The priestess recovered quickly. \"The bastard!\" she said, reaching\
  \ for the ebony rod and striding to the door. She slammed it behind her and he heard\
  \ the click of the lock. He gave her a moment to clear the corridor outside then\
  \ went to kneel at the keyhole, reaching for his picks.</p> \n    <p>But, even in\
  \ her hurry, Hortenza had been thinking a step ahead of him. The pick would not\
  \ engage the tumblers. He went to the table, where she had left the apprentice's\
  \ eye, and brought it to bear on the door. The lock made the stone glow bright red.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Krunzle said a short and pungent word, then turned to the hole in the\
  \ ceiling. He pushed a small table underneath, then leapt atop it. When he stood\
  \ upright, his head and shoulder poked through the opening, so that his eyes rose\
  \ just above the level of the packed-earth roof.</p> \n    <p>The open space was\
  \ in darkness and silence, except for the sound of a zither being inexpertly tuned.\
  \ Then the thief heard a noise like sand rushing through a giant hourglass, as the\
  \ great blind snake slithered across the roof toward him. He ducked down and, after\
  \ a moment, the sound ceased.</p> \n    <p>The lock clicked. The door opened. In\
  \ the moment between the two events, Krunzle put the table back where he had found\
  \ it and himself where Hortenza had left him. The witch stepped through the doorway,\
  \ panting from the stairs and presumably from the effort of dragging an unwilling\
  \ young woman all the way up from the sub-basement.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\"\

  \    <br> \"A good thief knows when to make himself scarce, and Krunzle is better\
  \ than most.\"\n    </div> \n    <p>She flung Galathea into the room. \"You stay\
  \ here, or so help me...\" She left the threat implied as she turned to the thief\
  \ and said, with a meaningful glance at the hole in the ceiling, \"Keep her here,\
  \ and I will make it worth your while. Let her go, and...” She pointed a tapered\
  \ fingernail at him and left the rest to Krunzle's imagination.</p> \n    <p>Then\
  \ she was gone, the door slammed. The girl tried the opener, found it locked, and\
  \ stamped her foot, saying under her breath a word that was not supposed to be available\
  \ to gently reared maidens. She looked at Krunzle, and the thief recognized the\
  \ parents in the child.</p> \n    <p>\"You're thinking,\" he told her, just to get\
  \ the process rolling, \"what it will cost you to secure my assistance.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>She folded her arms. \"Well?\"</p> \n    <p>\"What have you got?\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>She showed her fingers, unringed, her wrists unbraceleted, her neck unlaced.\
  \ \"I had only one thing, an amulet with a green stone.\"</p> \n    <p>He patted\
  \ a bulge in his upper garment. \"I already have that.\"</p> \n    <p>She stared\
  \ at him for a moment, then sighed and slipped one arm out of her shift, followed\
  \ by the other. A loud detonation from outside in the street caused her to pause,\
  \ then she continued, slipping the garment down to her waist.</p> \n    <p>\"This\
  \ is scarcely the time,\" Krunzle said.</p> \n    <p>She had been about to wriggle\
  \ the shift down over her hips. \"Then what?\"</p> \n    <p>\"How well do you know\
  \ the snake?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Hothet? He used to guard me in the cradle.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"Will he obey you?\" </p> \n    <p>She casually signaled an affirmative,\
  \ as if serpent-commanding was a universal skill. </p> \n    <p>\"Then get dressed\
  \ and get up on the table.\"</p> \n    <p>She looked up at the hole. \"The roof\
  \ is too low, the walls to either side sheer.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Leave that,\" he\
  \ said, \"to me.\"</p> \n    <p>He boosted her through the gap, then fluidly followed.\
  \ He crouched next to the hole, ready to duck back down, but then he saw the great\
  \ reptile coiled at her feet, its spade-sized head rubbing against one thigh.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>From the side of building that faced the street came another <i>crump!</i>\
  \ accompanied by a brief yellow glare. Almost immediately, there followed a metallic\
  \ rattling sound, like iron hail striking cobblestones. The thief crept to the parapet\
  \ and looked over. Below in the street, Baalariot stood, legs spread, a nimbus of\
  \ red light about his head like a halo, one hand holding a carved staff whose upper\
  \ tip ended in an amorphous cloud of stygian darkness which kept spitting out little\
  \ zig-zags of white lightning. He raised the implement and pointed it at where the\
  \ front door would be—with Hortenza presumably in it.</p> \n    <p>From the blackness\
  \ at the end of the staff rushed a torrent of colorless force, flecked with sparks\
  \ of gold and black. The angle of his view prevented Krunzle from seeing where it\
  \ struck, but he knew the effect must be less than overwhelming when he heard a\
  \ hiss of rage from directly below him, followed by a rumbling, trundling sound,\
  \ as of iron-shod wheels on stone. Now a shimmering wall, blue and almost transparent,\
  \ moved outward from the shrine toward the wizard, rolling back his rush of energy\
  \ until Baalariot gestured with his staff and the outflow ceased.</p> \n    <p>The\
  \ wall moved on, however, even picking up speed, and its outer edges began to curve\
  \ inward so that soon it would form a tube around the wizard. He made a downward\
  \ chopping gesture with one hand, while speaking a stream of syllables, and the\
  \ center of the approaching barrier began to melt and dissolve. A moment later it\
  \ winked out of existence.</p> \n    <p>Krunzle heard another hissed curse from\
  \ below him, and a snarling sound from her opponent. He thought it best to withdraw\
  \ before either parent became aware of him. Something was now snarling and bellowing\
  \ in the street below, accompanied by the stamp of heavy, hoofed feet on the cobbles.\
  \ The animal roars were soon met by a chittering sound, as if ten thousand maddened\
  \ insects were clashing their mandibles. The tramp of iron-shod hooves was overlaid\
  \ by a skittering, whispering noise. Krunzle imagined a horde of chitinous scorpions,\
  \ their pincers clicking, flooding across the street to swarm up some rough beast.\
  \ </p> \n    <p>Then he decided there was no profit in imagining such unpleasantness.\
  \ He crept back across the roof to Galathea, finding the snake asleep in a coil\
  \ and the girl indulging in some impatient toe-tapping. He felt a brief twinge of\
  \ compassion for poor, love-sick Didmus, who must eventually learn that the girl's\
  \ parent's temperaments had bred true in their offspring.</p> \n    <p>But that\
  \ was not his concern. \"This way,\" he said, and led her to where his grapnel and\
  \ knotted rope still hung from the neighboring roof. As she took hold of the cord,\
  \ the love song from above began again. She went up quickly, and the thief after\
  \ her. They followed their ears to a corner of the tenement roof sheltered by movable\
  \ walls of plaited bamboo.</p> \n    <p>A tender moment ensued, then Krunzle intervened\
  \ to say, \"It would be wise to leave here before the battle below ends and the\
  \ winner—assuming there is one—comes looking for the prize.\"</p> \n    <p>Didmus,\
  \ a gawky youth with ears almost large enough to serve as wings, said, \"I have\
  \ a carriage. We'll go to my uncle's manse. A priest of Erastil lives next door.\
  \ We'll be married before midnight.\"</p> \n    <p>Galathea looked down at her shift,\
  \ its hem soiled from the unswept roof. \"Married?\" she said. \"In this?\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Krunzle felt another brief spasm of sympathy for the apprentice wizard,\
  \ but said, \"In what quarter of the city is your uncle's manse?\"</p> \n    <p>The\
  \ youth's cracked voice said, \"By the night market, near the Druma Road Gate.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Then let us go.\"</p> \n    <p>And so, with eldritch lights and\
  \ harsh sounds fading behind them, they fled the lower city. Didmus, a generous\
  \ sort for a budding wizard, pressed into Krunzle's hand a small purse of gratitude\
  \ when they dropped him off at the market. The thief used the funds to buy a change\
  \ of clothing and a broad-brimmed hat that would obscure and shadow his face.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>He pinned the apprentice's eye to his new headgear, then settled himself\
  \ beside an untenanted booth at the edge of the market. When the gate opened in\
  \ the morning, he would be first out of it and on the road to Druma and its capital,\
  \ Kerse, where the streets were literally paved with gold and the walls of the houses\
  \ inset with gems.</p> \n    <p>Krunzle had long had a hankering to see Druma. He\
  \ sat with arms resting on his knees, and head resting on arms, and dreamed of easy\
  \ locks and unlatched windows.</p> \n    <p>Follow the rest of Krunzle's adventures\
