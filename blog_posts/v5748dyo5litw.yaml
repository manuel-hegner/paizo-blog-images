  articlebody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Ever since <em>Pathfinder Adventure\
  \ Path #3</em>, when James Jacobs and Wes Schneider had to hold me back from putting\
  \ a space elevator in Varisia, I've wanted to take Pathfinder to the stars. A year\
  \ later, I had the honor of writing up Golarion's solar system in <em>Pathfinder\
  \ Adventure Path #14</em>, and then expanding it further in <em>Pathfinder Campaign\
  \ Setting: Distant Worlds</em>. But I'm not the only one around here in love with\
  \ outer space and science fiction—I think all of us have at various times said,\
  \ \"Wouldn't it be fun to do a futuristic version of Pathfinder?\" Yet aside from\
  \ the occasional jaunt to other worlds in adventures like Pathfinder Adventure Path\
  \ #70: The Frozen Stars, it's always been a dream just out of reach.</p> \n    <p>Until\
  \ now.</p> \n    <p>Next August, Paizo will be releasing the <a href=\"/starfinder\"\
  >Starfinder Roleplaying Game</a>—a new science fantasy RPG based on the Pathfinder\
  \ universe and rules, but complete and standalone. It'll be backward compatible,\
  \ so you can still use all those Pathfinder RPG bestiaries, but will feature all\
  \ sorts of new classes, races, equipment, and other elements uniquely suited to\
  \ our far-future setting. You want to play a lashunta technomancer using magic to\
  \ hack the defense grid, or an android assassin with a laser rifle, or a ysoki ratfolk\
  \ mechanic clambering around the guts of a spaceship as you blast your way through\
  \ the enemy blockade? This is the place for it. There will also be new races you've\
  \ never seen before, new worlds beyond Golarion's system that we've never visited,\
  \ new twists on magic and the rules system itself—and, of course, ton and tons of\
  \ cool science fantasy gear, from starships and computers to infinitely sharp zero-edge\
  \ swords and rune-augmented plasma cannons.</p> \n    <p>The <em>Starfinder RPG\
  \ Core Rulebook</em> will be releasing at Gen Con 2017, but that's not all—we're\
  \ also going to be starting a monthly Starfinder Adventure Path in addition to our\
  \ ongoing Pathfinder Adventure Paths. The Starfinder AP volumes will include both\
  \ adventures and cool new rules and setting information to help expand your Starfinder\
  \ game. Plus monsters. Lots of monsters.</p> \n    <p>So how does all this science\
  \ fantasy goodness fit into the Pathfinder setting? Simple: Starfinder is set in\
  \ Golarion's solar system, but far in a possible future—one in which the gods have\
  \ mysteriously spirited Golarion away to an unknown location, and refuse to answer\
  \ questions about it. In its place, the cultures of that world have evolved and\
  \ spread throughout the solar system, especially to a vast space platform called\
  \ Absalom Station. Gifted access to a hyperspace dimension by an ascended AI deity,\
  \ the residents of the system suddenly find themselves with the ability to travel\
  \ faster than light, and the race is on to explore and colonize potentially millions\
  \ of worlds. But there are horrors out there in the darkness...</p> \n    <p>As\
  \ the Creative Director of Starfinder, I can't wait to show you everything we've\
  \ been building. Joining me as key players on Team Starfinder are longtime Paizo\
  \ developers Rob McCreary and Owen KC Stephens, as well as Creative Design Director\
  \ Sarah Robinson on the art side, but all the designers, developers, art staff,\
  \ and editors are working on different parts of the project—it's an all-hands-on-deck\
  \ affair. And it's not just us, either—as Starfinder will be released under the\
  \ OGL, we're looking forward to robust third-party support of the game.</p> \n \

  \ to participate! In the meantime, we wanted to give you a sneak preview of some\
  \ preliminary concept sketches for Absalom Station, androids, and ysoki from artist\
  \ Taylor Fischer (who you might know from games like XCOM and Civilization)—while\
  \ these are only our initial explorations, and far from final, it's fun to see the\
  \ process as things change and evolve. And it's never too early to chime in and\
  \ chat with us in <a href=\"/paizo/messageboards/paizoPublishing/starfinder\">the\
  \ new Starfinder forum!</a></p> \n    <p>We hope you're as excited about <a href=\"\
