  \     </div> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Infinite, the OGL, and You</h3> \n     <p>Both\
  \ Paizo and DriveThruRPG have received a lot of questions in the last month, mostly\
  \ about how potential changes to the Open Game License might affect the Infinite\
  \ marketplaces. I wanted to take this opportunity to address these both for creators\
  \ and consumers. </p> \n     <p>There have been no changes to the Open Game License,\
  \ and creators can continue to publish material on Pathfinder and Starfinder Infinite\
  \ under OGL version 1.0a, as has always been the case.</p> \n     <p>At some point\
  \ in the future, Paizo will transition to publishing under the forthcoming Open\
  \ RPG Creative license (ORC) being developed by Azora Law. At that time, we may\
  \ require publishers on Pathfinder and Starfinder Infinite to do the same but will\
  \ provide notice and guidance to the community when we have more information.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>In the meantime, it’s business as usual.</p> \n     <p>As the Pathfinder\
  \ and Starfinder player bases grow in the light of renewed interests in the brands,\
  \ community content programs like Infinite are going to be that much more important.\
  \ We can’t wait to see what amazing content you all come up with.</p> \n     <p\
