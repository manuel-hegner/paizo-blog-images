  \    <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\"></p> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">As we\
  \ close 2020, on this last night of the year, each of us took a moment to reflect\
  \ back on what 2020 brought for us. </p> \n      <p><b>Linda Zayas-Palmer</b> <em>(Organized\
  \ Play Managing Developer)</em>: Wow, 2020 has been quite the year. For all its\
  \ challenges, it’s been heartening to see the community come together and to watch\
  \ online play flourish, keeping people connected and bringing in so many new players\
  \ who had never seen a convention before. Kudos to the numerous dedicated volunteers,\
  \ both GMs and organizers, who made that possible!</p> \n      <p>And kudos as well\
  \ to the members of the Organized Play team, past and current, who also faced unprecedented\
  \ challenges and pressures. Mike Sayre, James Case, Thursty, Jenny, Tonya, and Alex:\
  \ I couldn’t ask for better coworkers. </p> \n      <p>I’m proud of what everyone’\
  s accomplished this year, and I’m excited about what 2021 has to offer. So I’d like\
  \ to take this space to announce the first of 2021’s big pieces of news: the newest\
  \ member of the Organized Play team. On January 4th, Mike Kimmel will be joining\
  \ us. Mike is the founder of the Freelance Forge group and a prolific Organized\
  \ Play freelancer, author of scenarios such as The Unseen Inclusion and the interactive\
  \ Hao Jin Cataclysm for Pathfinder First Edition, Iolite Squad Alpha for Pathfinder\
  \ Society in Second Edition, and The Protectorate Petition for Starfinder Society.\
  \ You’ll hear more from Mike soon in an upcoming blog.</p> \n      <hr width=\"\
  50%\"> \n      <p><b>Jenny Jarzabski</b> <em>(Starfinder Society Developer)</em>:\
  \ It’s hard to believe I’ve only been part of the Paizo team for a few months. Getting\
  \ the chance to collaborate with the folks of Org Play full time has been awesome,\
  \ and stepping up to take the helm of Starfinder Society is more than I could have\
  \ hoped for so soon!</p> \n      <p>I began 2020 writing the Starfinder GenCon interactive\
  \ special, The Last Bite, which got delayed before finally releasing online. We\
  \ had some bugs, and it wasn’t the same as walking through the Sagamore and watching\
  \ people play, but I hopped into different discord channels and listened to tables\
  \ playing my adventure virtually. I later ran it at Emerald Con, also online! </p>\
  \ \n      <p>As a freelancer—and even now after my hire—I’ve often felt isolated\
  \ this year. But seeing the way our community continued to rally around playing\
  \ games, raising money for charity, and supporting one another through it all has\
  \ been truly inspiring. One of my favorite things about Organized Play is the connectivity\
  \ to the community, and of being part of a living campaign. We don’t tell these\
  \ stories in a vacuum. All of you reading this are part of them. Thanks for that—\
  let’s do it again next year!</p> \n      <hr width=\"50%\"> \n      <p><b>Alex Speidel</b>\
  \ <em>(Organized Play Associate)</em>: Obviously, this year was a big year for me,\
  \ because I joined Paizo in March! While that’s exciting, I wanted to look at some\
  \ other really cool things about this year:<br> - We managed to move our major conventions\
  \ online, including our largest event ever with PaizoCon Online and the largest-ever\
  \ online interactive specials at Gen Con Online.<br> - In addition to releasing\
  \ a year of scenarios, we got caught up with Venture Officer maintenance, the Reporting\
  \ Errors inbox, and so much more behind the scenes.<br> - Some of my favorite scenarios\
  \ this year included SFS 3-07: Strike at Zone 78, which I thought was a great installment\
  \ in the storyline of the copaxi; SFS 3-10: Live Adventure Extreme!, the exact scenario\
  \ I have wanted since I learned about Zo! and his media empire; and PFS 1-25, because\
  \ evil pipe organs are cool.<br> - In personal news, I earned my second Nova for\
  \ GMing Starfinder Society, ran a group through 2.5 books of Threefold Conspiracy,\
  \ got a bunch of new dice, and met a ton of fantastic players and GMs through conventions,\
  \ the VO corps and the local Emerald City Lodge.<br></p> \n      <p>It’s been a\
  \ weird year, but I’m excited to see what comes next!</p> \n      <hr width=\"50%\"\
  > \n      <p><b>Thurston Hillman</b> <em>(Pathfinder Society Developer)</em>: With\
  \ the transition from SFS to PFS, Thursty took on loads of new tasks just before\
  \ the new year, leaving him deep in development and focused on bringing a quality\
  \ program to your door.</p> \n      <p>For me, this year was all about being flexible.\
  \ My job today doesn’t look like it did in 2019 or years prior. I got to attend\
  \ two physical shows in 2020, and collectively the team went to four. I remember\
  \ reading news about China’s issues with Covid in the airport on the way home from\
  \ GenghisCon in Denver. Instead of seeing all our friends in-person, we pivoted\
  \ to online events. PaizoCon 2020 set the benchmark - over 1500 tables of games\
  \ during the event!</p> \n      <p>Our community showed its resilience and for that\
  \ I’m eminently grateful. There is no way our gaming groups could have survived\
  \ without the strong leadership demonstrated by the venture-officers. The online\
  \ team provided assistance and education for the whole corps, but without the store\
  \ organizers and the location coordinators embracing the change we would have been\
  \ dead in the water. They thought it would be a few weeks, maybe a month, that we\
  \ would need to maintain the shift. Seven months later, many of our locations remain\
  \ closed. Despite online fatigue, they continue to make sure games are available\
  \ to our players. I cannot express enough my gratitude and thanks to these stalwarts\
  \ and I give thanks that we have such a wonderful group!</p> \n      <p>Despite\
  \ the obstacles put in our way by 2020, the OP team stepped up and delivered! We\
  \ kept the program going with only slight hiccups along the way, which is a HUGE\
  \ testament to the professionalism of the OP team members. Alex joined the team\
  \ in February and made such a huge difference so quickly, I’m amazed we ever had\
  \ a program without him. I took several weeks of vacation this year and was able\
  \ to relax, knowing the program operations would continue under his competent eye.\
  \ We also had to say goodbye to two of our team, but in losing James and Mike to\
  \ other teams, we gained Jenny and Mike Kimmel. I’m excited to see how they add\
  \ to the team dynamic! </p> \n      <p>If you missed it last week, we sanctioned\
  \ <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq023dy?Pathfinder-Adventure-Troubles-in-Otari\"\
  ><em>Troubles in Otari</em></a> for Pathfinder (second edition). Be sure to check\
  \ back on January 5th for Pathfinder Playtest news, and then on Thursday for the\
  \ first of our 2021 Monthly Updates (including a bit of Starfinder sanctioning news!)</p>\
