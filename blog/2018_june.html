<p itemprop="description">Earlier this week, Logan gave you the skinny on Resonance and how it interacts with some iconic and all-new magic items. If you missed out on Logan's explanation of Resonance, you might want to take a look <a href="/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkvl?Trinkets-and-Treasures"><b>here</b></a> before reading on, because we're going to come back to it at the end of the blog. You got how Resonance works? Good. Now forget about it, we're going to talk about weapons instead.</p>

<h2>Potency and Properties</h2>
<p>Unlike items with the invested trait or ones that you activate, weapons typically require no Resonance to use. You just pick one up and swing (or shoot, or sling, or thrust, or throw), and the magic weapon unleashes its punch, often with potency. Think as a weapon's potency as its "plus" and more. Potency still grants an item bonus to your attack rolls with the weapon, but now it also increases the damage dealt by an additional weapon die for each point of potency bonus. For example, let's say you find a <i>+1 longsword</i> buried in an otyugh's dung heap. Regardless of its current soiling, that weapon grants not only a +1 item bonus to attack rolls, but on a successful hit it deals 2d8 + Strength modifier damage, instead of the standard 1d8 + Strength modifier. A <i>+2 longsword</i> would instead grant a +2 item bonus to attacks and deal 3d8 + Strength modifier damage, and so on.</p>

<p>Of course, potency is only a part of the story. Magic weapons can also have properties. The maximum potency and the number of properties a weapon can have are based on that weapon's quality. Standard weapons can't have potency or properties, while expert-quality weapons can have up to <i>+2 potency</i> and one property. Master-quality weapons can have up to <i>+4 potency</i> and two properties, and legendary weapons can be <i>+5 </i>weapons and have three properties. Sometimes, special materials can affect the number of properties a magic weapon can possess. Since cold iron resists magic, weapons made of cold iron have one fewer property. Conversely, weapons made of highly magical orichalcum can have one additional property, but because the metal is so rare and difficult to work, these weapons must be legendary.</p>

<p>Both potency and property are imbued within a suitable weapon by etching magical runes upon it. Runes can be fairly easily removed or added (assuming the quality of the weapon allows it), and can even be found etched on a <i>runestone</i>, allowing them to be transferred separately from a weapon. Say you just found a handful of weapon property <i>runestones</i> in your adventure. What properties might they be? Well, let's take a look at one of the favorites of good and undead-hating clerics.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class = "stat-block-title">Disrupting <span class = "stat-block-cr">Rune 5+</span></p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Method of Use</b> etched, melee weapon</p>
<hr style = "margin: 0.5rem 0;" />
<p class = "stat-block-1">A disrupting weapon deals extra damage to undead. Undead hit by an attack with a disrupting weapon takes extra positive damage and additional effects on a critical hit.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Type</b> standard; <b>Level</b> 5; <b>Price</b> 150 gp</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">The weapon deals 1d6 extra positive damage. On a critical hit, the undead is enfeebled 1 until the end of your next turn.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Type</b> greater; <b>Level</b> 15 (Uncommon), <b>Price</b> 6,200 gp</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">The weapon deals 2d6 extra positive damage. On a critical hit, the undead creature must attempt a DC 32 Fortitude save with the following effects.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Success</b> The target is enfeebled 2 until the end of your next turn.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Critical Success</b> The target is enfeebled 1 until the end of your next turn.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Failure</b> The target is enfeebled 3 until the end of your next turn.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Critical Failure</b> The target is destroyed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <i>disrupting</i> property comes in two varieties. The standard disrupting property deals some positive damage and can enfeeble undead. The greater version deals more positive damage, and can force undead to attempt a save&mdash;if they critically fail that save, they're destroyed outright!</p>
<p>Of course, other types of properties can do even more incredible things. Sometimes, these properties can require an expenditure of resonance.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class = "stat-block-title">Vorpal <span class = "stat-block-cr">Rune 17</span></p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">Evocation, Magical</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Price</b> 15,000 gp</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Method of Use</b> etched, melee weapon that deals slashing damage</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Activation</b> [[R]] Focus Activation; <b>Trigger</b> You roll a natural 20 and critically succeed at a Strike with the weapon targeting a creature with at least one head.</p>
<hr style = "margin: 0.5rem 0;" />
<p class = "stat-block-1">When you activate a <i>vorpal weapon</i>, the triggering creature must succeed at a DC 35 Fortitude save, or it is decapitated. This kills any creature except ones that don't require a head to live (such as constructs, oozes, and some aberrations and undead). For creatures with multiple heads (such as ettins or hydras), this usually kills the creature only if you sever its lasthead.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If, like the <i>vorpal</i> property, a weapon property has an activation, you have to spend Resonance to activate it; however, unlike worn items, you don't have to already be attuned to a weapon to activate it. So roll those 20s and snicker-snack your opponents for as long as you've got the resonance to spare.</p>

<h2>Armor Potency and Properties</h2>
<p>Magic armor also features potency and may have properties. Like weapons, armor can hold a maximum amount of potency and properties based on its quality and special materials, and you can add, remove, or transfer potency and properties between armor via runes. The maximum potency and number of properties for armor is the same as for weapons, though it's worth noting that rather than granting an additional property, orichalcum armor instead grants a +1 circumstance bonus to initiative rolls and automatically repairs itself over time.</p>

<p>Armor potency grants an item bonus to AC (including Touch Armor Class) and to your saving throws. Magic and high-quality armors are also easier to use. Armors of expert quality have their armor check penalty reduced by one, while master-quality armors have their penalty reduced by two, and legendary armor by three.</p>

<p>Like other worn items, you must invest armor; that is, you have to spend resonance to gain its magical effects. If your armor has an activated property, you must have invested the armor before you can use that ability. Let's look at an example of such a property.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class = "stat-block-title">Invisibility <span class = "stat-block-cr">Rune 8+</span></p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">Illusion, Magical</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Method of Use</b> etched, light armor</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Activation</b> [[A]] Command Activation</p>
<hr style = "margin: 0.5rem 0;" />
<p class = "stat-block-1">Once per day, you can whisper the command word to become invisible for 1 minute, gaining the effects of a 2nd-level <i>invisibility</i>spell.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Type</b> standard; <b>Level</b> 8; <b>Price</b> 500 gp</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Type</b> greater; <b>Level</b> 10; <b>Price</b> 1,000 gp</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">You can activate the armor up to 3 times per day.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Craft Requirements</b> You must supply a casting of invisibility.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This favored property of many rangers and rogues (and maybe a sneaky alchemist or two) allows the attuned creature to gain the benefit of an <i>invisibility</i> spell at the cost of an action and 1 RP. The greater version enables you to activate the armor three times a day instead of just once.</p>

<p>But not all properties feature activations or require expending Resonance beyond that spent for initial attunement. Here's a classic example of one&mdash;<i>fortification</i>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class = "stat-block-title">Fortification <span class = "stat-block-cr">Rune 12+</span></p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">Abjuration, Magical</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Method of Use</b> etched, medium or heavy armor</p>
<hr style = "margin: 0.5rem 0;" />
<p class = "stat-block-1">Each time you're hit by a critical hit while wearing fortification armor, attempt a flat check with the listed DC. If you succeed, that critical hit becomes a normal hit. This property thickens the armor, increasing its Bulk by 1.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Type</b> standard; <b>Level</b> 12; <b>Price</b> 2,000 gp; <b>DC</b> 17</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Type</b> greater; <b>Level</b> 18; <b>Price</b> 24,000 gp; <b>DC</b> 14</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">Granting medium and heavy armor users the possibility to transform a critical hit to a normal hit, <i>fortification</i> provides an excellent constant effect for fighters, paladins, and more martial-focused clerics.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Potions</h2>
<p>Now that you know how magic weapons and armor work, let's talk a look at something much less permanent, but often useful in a pinch&mdash;potions! While in First Edition, potions were spells of 3rd level or lower in a bottle; we wanted to go a slightly different route this time. Potions not only can have effects that reach into higher levels, but they also don't need to be tied to particular spell effects. All of that said, there are just some potions that are so iconic and necessary, you can't mess with them too much. Who doesn't need a <i>healing potion</i> every now and then?</p>

<p>The first thing you'll notice is that there are six varieties of this point, ranging from level 1 (restoring 1d8 Hit Points) to level 16 (restoring 9d8+20 Hit Points) You'll also notice that this potion (and all potions) has an activation. Which, you guessed it, means you have to spend Resonance to gain its effect.</p>

<p>Of course, sometimes a <i>healing potion</i> does its best work when you're down for the punch and can't activate it yourself. No worries. The time-honored tradition of pouring a potion down your wounded friend's gullet is still in the game. Your companion spends an Interact basic action to administer the potion to you, but you still need to spend Resonance to gain the potion's effect (thankfully, you don't have to be conscious to do so).</p>
<p>Of course, this new flexibility for potions allows us to keep some items that in First Edition were called elixirs (a term that in the Playtest, we now use for alchemical concoctions). Here's one of my favorites:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class = "stat-block-title">Dragon's Breath Potion <span class = "stat-block-cr">Item 7+</span></p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">Consumable, Evocation, Magical, Potion</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Method of Use</b> held, 1 hand; <b>Bulk</b> L</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Activation</b> [[A]] Operate Activation</p>
<hr style = "margin: 0.5rem 0;" />
<p class = "stat-block-1">This liquid contains blood from a certain breed of dragon. For 1 hour after you imbibe the acrid concoction, you can unleash a breath weapon used by that breed of dragon. The potion's level and Price, as well as the amount of damage and the DC of the saving throw, all depend on the age of the dragon whose blood you used. This item has the trait matching the damage type of the breath weapon.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">You can spend another Operate Activation action with no RP cost immediately after drinking the potion to exhale dragon breath. At any point during the potion's duration, you can use the breath weapon by spending 1 RP and 2 Operate Activation actions (one to inhale the necessary air and the other to breathe out). After you use the breath weapon, you can't do so again for 1d4 rounds.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">Each creature in the area of the breath weapon attempts a save against your breath weapon.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Success</b> Half damage.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Critical Success</b> No damage.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Failure</b> Full damage.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Critical Failure</b> Double damage.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Type</b> young; <b>Level</b> 7; <b>Price</b> 45 gp; <b>Damage</b> 4d6; DC 21</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Type</b> adult; <b>Level</b> 12; <p class = "stat-block-1">Price</b> 250 gp; <b>Damage</b> 7d6; DC 28</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Type</b> wyrm; <b>Level</b> 17; <b>Price</b> 2,000 gp; <b>Damage</b> 10d6; DC 35</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class = "stat-block-title">Dragon Breath Weapon (Save)</p>
Black or copper 30-foot line of acid (Reflex)<br />
Blue or bronze 30-foot line of electricity (Reflex)<br />
Brass 30-foot line of fire (Reflex)<br />
Green 15-foot cone of poison (Fortitude)<br />
Gold or red 15-foot cone of fire (Reflex)<br />
Silver or white 15-foot cone of cold (Reflex)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This one is interesting because you spend Resonance when you first drink the potion and spew some draconic hate on your foes, and can then continue to do so for an hour after imbibing whenever you spend actions and RP. Pick the right kind of dragon, and you'll be the life of whatever party you join.</p>

<p>Very closely related to potions are oils. Like potions, you activate these consumable items, but you do so by applying the oil to an object or person. While it usually takes one hand to drink or administer a potion, applying oil takes two hands. This particular oil may be of interest to shield users.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class = "stat-block-title">Oil of Mending <span class = "stat-block-cr">Item 3</span></p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">Consumable, Magical, Oil, Transmutation</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Price</b> 6 gp</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Method of Use</b> held, 2 hands; <b>Bulk</b> L</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Activation</b> [[A]] Operate Activation</p>
<hr style = "margin: 0.5rem 0;" />
<p class = "stat-block-1">Applying this oil to an item casts a 2nd-level <i>mending</i> spell that repairs the item. If the item was broken, it is no longer broken. If the item has Dents, it loses those Dents. This restoration doesn't restore lost pieces. For instance, if used on a text with missing pages, it wouldn't recreate the lost pages.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A perfect backup when you fail your Crafting check to Repair an Item, or when you need to repair that dented shield in a hurry, the oil of mending has plenty of other uses.</p>

<p>Well, that's it for this week! Join us next week as we take a little walk in the woods.</p>

<p itemprop = "description"><i>Today's Pathfinder Adventure Card Game Homebrew Special blog is by Richard Noble (<a href="/people/BrotherTyler">Brother Tyler</a>), about a homebrew of a different kind. Richard wanted to organize his PACG cards, so he came up with some dividers and other tidbits to facilitate storage and gameplay. They're pretty boss, sez me. &mdash;Mike</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>As our gaming group's facilitator, it falls to me to control the game box, drawing cards and returning them to the box during our PACG sessions. It's like being the banker in a popular real estate game, but without the benefit of being able to skim money from the top.</p>

<p>Has something like the following ever happened to you?</p>

<p><i>With the town guard searching for Pillbug Podiker, Valeros offers to stand post at the city gate. Recalling a large chest in which the guardsmen kept confiscated contraband, he hopes to find some useful weapon. Finding the chest durably locked, he turns to his crowbar...</i></p>

<p><b>Simon:</b> I rolled a 14, opening the chest. And I got a 1 on the d4 roll, so I get 1 weapon from the box.</p>
<p><b>Richard</b> (reaches into the box and pulls out a weapon, handing the card facedown to Simon): Here you go!</p>
<p><i>Valeros quickly opens the lid of the chest and guffaws in delight, withdrawing a large glaive from within.</i></p>
<p><b>Simon:</b> Alright! A Shock Glaive +1! Waitaminute, why is there a "1" in the top right corner? Isn't this a "B" scenario?</p>
<p><b>Richard</b>: Dangit!</p>

<p>Or how about this?</p>

<p><i>Meanwhile, in one of the village houses that Pillbug Podiker was known to have visited before his disappearance, Merisiel is searching for clues. Hidden in the corner beneath a pile of blankets she finds a battered chest. "No problem," she says confidently as she pulls a set of slender tools from inside her jerkin.</i></p>

<p><b>Christina:</b> I recharged the Masterwork Tools to automatically defeat the barrier, and I rolled a 1 for the number of items I get.</p>
<p><b>Richard</b> (reaches into the box and pulls out a card, handing it facedown to Christina): Here you go!</p>
<p><i>Cautiously, Merisiel lifts the lid of the chest to reveal its contents, jumping back in surprise when a large beast suddenly forces its way out, growling in fury. As she reaches for her knives, she wonders how the chest's owner got the Saber-Toothed Tiger into the small chest.</i></p>
<p><b>Christina:</b> (Looking archly at her husband): I said I get an item, not an ally.</p>
<p><b>Richard</b>: Great googly moogly!</p>

<p>Now I won't say that neither of these types of incidents has ever happened to me, and I can't say that they haven't. Besides, my wife tells me that it happens to everyone. To keep things like this from happening again, and to satisfy my abnormal compulsion for organization, I developed some dividers to keep everything neat and tidy. I decided early on that I wanted to make the dividers sufficient to support whatever sort of organizational method different players might like, with color coding and text of sufficient size and font type to be legible at arm's length.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180629-Dividers1.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180629-Dividers1_360.jpeg"></a>
<br />The dividers that started it all</p></div>

<p>Something else to consider was long-term storage. While the stock box comes with a plastic vacuum tray that can fit all of the cards, things get a little dicey when you sleeve the cards. Personally, I sleeve all of my PACG cards. I wanted to make sure that the cards last, even when my wife is eating potato chips during a game. I used the PACG organizer available from The Broken Token, removing all of the cards for the AP from their boxes. I needed to ensure there were dividers for all of the different card types as well as for all of the different deck indicators. This makes adding cards (say, a 5th player joins us for a game) or removing them (say, when we finish an Adventure Path) a snap.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180629-RunelordsBox.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180629-RunelordsBox_360.jpeg"></a>
<a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180629-MummysMaskBox.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180629-MummysMaskBox_360.jpeg"></a>
<br />The dividers in the stock vacuum tray (left) and in The Broken Token's PACG Organizer (right)</p></div>

<p>The basic dividers are tall enough so that the labels can be seen over the top of the cards when they are unsleeved, but they're short enough to fit in the base set box with the rules on top and the lid all the way down. If your cards are sleeved and the dividers are cut to the shortest height, much of the label is obscured by the sleeve, but the color bar is still visible. Some players might not use the base set box, and those that have a storage solution that allows for more height can cut the cards to different heights so that they can be seen above the cards even when they are sleeved. There are even different cut lines so that some dividers can be taller than others&mdash;perhaps you want the main WEAPON divider to be visible above the other weapon dividers (e.g., WEAPON&mdash;B, WEAPON&mdash;1, etc.).</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180629-Sleeved.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180629-Sleeved_360.jpeg"></a>
<br />A sleeved card (left) and an unsleeved card (right) next to a divider</p></div>

<p>The file for each Adventure Path also includes special dividers peculiar to that AP. The Skull &amp; Shackles dividers include dividers for the ships and the fleet card; Wrath of the Righteous has dividers for cohorts, mythic paths, and the redemption card; and Mummy's Mask has dividers for scourges, traders, and the bazaar and defensive stance cards.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180629-Dividers3.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180629-Dividers3_360.jpeg"></a>
<br />The special cards for each of the Adventure Paths</p></div>

<p>Dividers for the organized play "Season of&hellip;" cards are also included, using the color black. Also, there are "blank" dividers that allow you to further customize. These use a light gray so you can write your own text.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180629-Dividers5.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180629-Dividers5_360.jpeg"></a>
<br />Two of the "Season of&hellip;" cards next to a blank divider cut to a taller height</p></div>

<p>There are also some optional cards to facilitate different types of storage methods. Most of the card types have an IN USE divider. There are three options for removing cards from play, depending on what floats your boat: When you decide that you're tired of seeing the Mace come up during Fortress of the Stone Giants, you might simply put it behind the WEAPON&mdash;B divider. Or maybe you'd prefer to put it behind the WEAPON&mdash;BASIC divider. And when you finally banish that pesky Goblin Pyro during <i>Spires of Xin-Shalast</i>, you might decide to put it behind the MONSTER&mdash;REMOVED divider.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180629-Dividers4.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180629-Dividers4_360.jpeg"></a>
<br />It's like the Whopper&reg; of card organization: you can have it your way.</p></div>

<p>I use the full-size dividers. I print them on card stock, laminate them, and cut them to size. Lamination isn't absolutely necessary, but they're pretty durable this way, and any snack residue wipes away easily.</p>

<p>At some point it occurred to me that some people might already have dividers and just need labels. Some game supply companies sell dividers; and some players might use materials such as plasticard or cardstock cut down to size. To support these and other options, I added pages that only have the labels. Players can then cut out the ones they want and affix them to their dividers using tape or glue.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180629-Dividers2.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180629-Dividers2_360.jpeg"></a>
<br />These labels have been affixed with tape to thick plasticard cut to size</p></div>

<p>Another thing I did was create dividers and labels for the class/character/add-on decks. There is a basic set of dividers applicable to all class/character/add-on decks (boons), and a set of dividers specific to each class/character/add-on deck (cohorts, if included in that deck, and each of the characters). Most of the dividers are exactly the same as for the APs, with the addition of two different types of dividers for the overall deck and small labels for your storage solution. Two of the deck dividers have the name of the deck and images of all of the characters in that deck. The other two deck dividers simply have the deck name and logo. Any/all of these can be used however you want, depending on your storage solution.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180629-Deckboxes.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180629-Deckboxes_360.jpeg"></a>
<br />The boxes for my class/character/add-on decks from different angles</p></div>

<p>I use plain boxes for long-term storage. These generally don't have the majority of card dividers in them because I don't want to print up that many dividers. I have a special deck holder for when I use a class/character/add-on deck in organized play, and this holder has the dividers for all of the cards.</p>

<p>Cards for characters include the logo and/or name of the base set or class/character/add-on deck to which they belong. This way you can see at a glance that it's Kyra from the Cleric Class Deck romping around in the Worldwound and not Kyra from Wrath of the Righteous.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180629-CharacterDividers.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180629-CharacterDividers_360.jpeg"></a>
<br />Dividers for all three versions of the iconic cleric, Kyra</p></div>

<p>Another part of my divider files is standees. When my group first started playing the game, we found that the tokens were sometimes difficult to see, pick up, and move, so we often proxied the tokens with dice (which didn't work well). Also, those tokens take up space, and we often played where space was at a premium. I decided that some sort of substitute was necessary. I would have preferred to use miniatures, but some of the characters don't have miniatures and I didn't want to have to either look for miniatures that were "close enough" or explain to players, some of whom can be quite persnickety, that the red-bearded dwarf miniature represents Agna or some such. Most of the characters have images that are part of the Community Use Package, making paper standees relatively easy. I made the standees in two sizes, though my group uses the smaller ones. These can be printed, cut out, and assembled to make triangular standees that are easier to see, pick up, and move. I also laminate the standees to avoid that annoying snack residue. We found that the standees needed some weighted bases to keep them from tipping over, so I found suitably sized art tiles at a local craft store and glued each standee to a tile, then cut small squares of drawer liner (available by the roll at local DIY stores) and glued them to the bottoms to protect the table surface. For those characters that don't have images, I have six blank standees, each on a different colored base. The standees can be stored easily in tackle box inserts.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180629-Standees2.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180629-Standees2_360.jpeg"></a>

<br />Standees for the Rise of the Runelords characters, with a blank (left); my standee and dice storage (right)</p></div>

<p>Every time Paizo and Lone Shark bring us a new adventure path or class/character/add-on deck, I upload a corresponding set of dividers/standees to BoardGameGeek and provide a link to the files <a href="/threads/rzs2t86z?Vertical-Card-DividersOrganizers">here on paizo.com</a>. It will be interesting to see how next year's new core set and Curse of the Crimson Throne AP change things up. I'm always looking for ways to improve the dividers/standees. Hopefully, some of you have found these useful in some way!</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline">Reflections on Origins Game Faire!</h1>

<p class="date">Wednesday, June 27, 2018</p>

<div itemprop="articlebody">

<div class="blurbCenter" style="display:none;"><a href="/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PFSUpdates2.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PFSUpdates2_180.jpeg"></a></div>

<p itemprop="description">My travels take me to many conventions during the year. I enjoy them all, mostly because I get a chance to meet our volunteers and fans. But Origins holds a special place in my heart. I had never attended Origins before joining the organized play team at Paizo, but I'm glad it is now a staple of my convention tour.</p>

<p>Why do I enjoy it so much? Several key reasons, I think. First, while it is one of the biggest conventions in the United States outside of the Comic Cons and PAX events, it still has a small convention feel. I believe this is due to the compact nature of the hotels and convention center that make up the core of the event. It is a 5-minute walk from my hotel room to the Franklin Ballrooms, where we hold most of the Paizo events. I can get to the food court in 5 minutes. Ditto to getting to the Exhibit Halls, where the vendors and open gaming tables are located, to the Drury meeting rooms for GAMA meetings, and to the show offices. Oh, and the Starbucks is just across the hall from the Org Play space. Great for my coffee needs!</p>

<p>My second reason is the volunteers. Our volunteers at Origins are among some of the best. We had a few scheduling issues and the volunteers stepped up every time to cover tables. They flexed on what games they ran, which allowed us to respond to shifting demand for Starfinder and Pathfinder games. The HQ staff works well together, using their skills to compliment each other and support the GMs.</p>

<p>Finally, I love the convention attendees. I view our players as friends I haven't met yet and love the fact I got to add a few more names and faces to my friends known list. We talked characters, scenarios, likes, and dislikes, favorite things&hellip; this list goes on. Getting to talk to our players recharges my batteries and makes the hours of back office planning and work worthwhile. Thank you, everyone, who came and shared your stories. I look forward to continuing our conversations at events in the future.</p>

<p>I'm not the only staffer that attended Origins 2018. We had a team of 5 running games and introducing the Pathfinder Playtest to attendees. Cosmo went on to the American Libraries Conference the weekend after and so didn't get a chance to chime in and Thurston put his thoughts into last week's <a href="/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkve?New-Scenarios-Renkroda-Heartlove">Starfinder Society scenario preview blog</a>, but both designer Mark Seifter and organized play lead developer John Compton share their thoughts.</p>

<p>From Mark:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This was my first Origins ever, and it was quite an exciting show! With nonstop Pathfinder Second Edition demos layered on top of runs of The Rose Street Revenge, Origins gave me my first chance to show the new game to gamers of wildly disparate gaming backgrounds and play experiences (as opposed to the deeper Pathfinder fans who tend to attend PaizoCon) and to learn&hellip;they all like this new game I've been working on, they like it a lot. The universal excitement was contagious, and an important reminder to me of just why I love what I do. One of my highlights was hearing from our crack team of volunteers (who did an amazing job!) how their demo runs had turned out, only to discover that they and their players were as excited as I was; in fact, one of the volunteers for 3 out of 5 days enjoyed the Pathfinder Second Edition demos so much that she asked to fill up the rest of her days with demos instead of playing.</p>

<p>Finally, as Owen pointed out when I returned to the office, Starfinder's victory as fan favorite at the Origins Awards means I am now an Origins Award-winning designer. I hadn't thought of it because to me, the ultimate reward is having people love the games and books I work on, and the award is just a manifestation of that.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>John's thoughts on the event:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This was my first Origins since 2006, which was far before I knew anything about organized play. Columbus puts on a fun show with a great community, and it was a delight to meet the Ohio crew as well as Paizo enthusiasts from many states beyond. I split my time between running shorter demos of Pathfinder's second edition, running preregistered tables of the 5-hour<i>Rose Street Revenge</i>second edition quest experience, and wandering the Franklin ballroom to check out the action. Particularly impressive was all of the Starfinder Society energy, especially when we debuted the first ever Starfinder Society multitable interactive special <a href="/products/btpya08y?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-1-99-The-Scoured-Stars-Invasion"><i>#1-99: The Scoured Stars Invasion</i></a> by Mikko Kallio. He and Thurston Hillman put together a great experience, and the Origins GMs and HQ volunteers made it all possible.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>So if you haven't been to Origins before, I suggest you consider coming out to Origins 2019! If you're already planning on attending, I'll see you there!</p>

<p>Check back next week for our first of the month "Stars, Cons, and More" blog!</p>

<p>Until next time - Explore, Report, Cooperate!</p>

<p itemprop="description">Around here it's no secret that I like monsters. Some could say that monsters are one of the biggest reasons I have a desk in this office. Monsters are not only foes for player characters to fight in Pathfinder, they also help tell stories, particularly stories beyond mortal ability or understanding.</p>

<p>Some monsters have an intrinsic connection to places, things, or philosophical concepts, and no type of monster possesses these qualities more than outsiders. Even though <a href="/products/btpya1am?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Planar-Adventures"><i>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Planar Adventures</i></a> is a book about the planes and it's inhabitants, there are more monster types than just outsiders in the books' bestiary chapter. In Planar Adventures' bestiary you can find an aberration, an ooze, a couple of plants, a monstrous humanoid, in addition to a selection of outsiders that needed new members of their families.</p>

<p>You know what? Why don't I end this little blog with a list of what you'll find in <i>Planar Adventures</i>.</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline">Trinkets and Treasures</h1>
<p class="date">Monday, June 25, 2018</p>

<div itemprop="articleBody">

<div class="blurbCenter" style="display: none;"><a href="/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20180625-Preview.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20180625-Preview_360.jpeg"></a></div>

<p itemprop="description"><i>Wayfinder. Bag of holding. Ring of the ram. Staff of power. Holy avenger</i>.</p>

<p>The magic items you find during your adventures become a part of your story and let you do things beyond the techniques you've mastered and the spells you know. So how do these essentials of the game work in the Pathfinder Playtest?</p>

<p>Magic items are used in three major ways: by investing them, by activating them, or automatically. Invested items are ones you wear that you have to prepare as you don them, after which they work continuously. Activating items follows a system similar to that used for spells. Just as casting a spell requires you to spend actions to supply the somatic, verbal, and material components of the spell, activated items require you to use the Command Activation, Focus Activation, or Operate Activation action, or a combination of multiple actions. A potion requires you to spend an Operate Activation action to drink it. A <i>necklace of fireballs</i> requires you to spend 2 Operate Activation actions to unbind a bead and throw it. Activating a <i>luck blade</i> to reroll an attack just takes a mental nudge with a Focus Activation reaction (though you get to do that only once per day). Automatic activation happens with a small category of items that give their benefit whenever they're used for their normal purpose. A prime example is a sword with the <i>frost</i> property rune, which is always coated with frost and needs only hit a foe to deal extra cold damage.</p>

<div class = "blurb360"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20180625-Staves.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20180625-Staves_360.jpeg"></a>
<p><i>Illustration by Wayne Reynolds</i></p></div>

<h2>Resonance</h2>
<p>Activating or investing an item costs 1 Resonance Point (RP). You might have heard a bit about this on the Glass Cannon podcast! Resonance is a new resource all characters have that can be used to activate items. Your innate magic item resonance is represented by a number of Resonance Points equal to your level plus your Charisma modifier. This ties back to the Pathfinder First Edition concept of Charisma as the main ability score tied to innate magic, as seen in the Use Magic Device skill and the fact that Charisma is used for spell-like abilities, oracles, sorcerers, and so forth. However, in Pathfinder Second Edition, true scholars of itemcraft *cough*alchemists*cough* might get to use their Intelligence instead.</p>

<p>The idea of resonance stems from the Pathfinder First Edition occultist, who was able to tap into the magical potential of items, and even before that to the idea of resonance between creatures and various magic items, as seen with the resonant powers of <i>wayfinders</i>. We've expanded that concept to apply to everyone. In practical terms, you're really unlikely to run out of Resonance Points unless you're using an absurd number of items, and you're at the greatest risk at low levels. You still have a chance even if your pool is empty, though. You can overspend Resonance Points! If you're at 0 RP, you can attempt to activate or invest an item anyway. You need to attempt a flat check (a d20 roll with no modifiers) against a DC equal to 10 + the number of points you've overspent today. So the first item has a 50% chance of working, and it gets more risky from there.</p>

<p>We expect Resonance Points to be a contentious topic, and we're really curious to see how it plays at your tables. It's one of the more experimental changes to the game, and the playtest process gives us a chance to see it in the wild before committing to it. Here are the advantages we see from a design perspective:</p>
<ol>
<li>Using items is clear and consistent. Spend the required actions and 1 RP, and you activate or invest your item. If someone else wants to use the same item, you can remove it and let them put it on and invest it themselves.</li>
<li>You have less to track. We get to remove some of the sub-pools that individual items have (such as "10 rounds per day which need not be consecutive" or "5 charges") because we know you have an overall limited resource. There are still some items that can't be used without limit, but they get to be special exceptions rather than being common out of necessity.</li>
<li>It puts the focus on the strongest items. Because you can't activate items indefinitely, your best bet is to use the most RP-efficient item, not the most gp-efficient item. You want a high-level healing wand because you get more healing for your Resonance Point rather than getting a bunch of low-level wands because they're cheap.</li>
<li>Investiture limits what you can wear. That means we don't need to rely heavily on an item slot system, creating more flexibility in what kind of worn items are useful. You'll read more about this on the blog on Friday, when we talk about removing the magic item Christmas tree!</li>
</ol>

<p>Will those benefits be compelling? Will people prefer this system over the Pathfinder First Edition system? We look forward to finding out!</p>

<p>Want to look at an item to see how this works in practice?</p>

<blockquote>

<p class = "stat-block-title">Cloak of Elvenkind <span class = "stat-block-cr">Item 10+</span></p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">Illusion, Invested, Magical</p>

<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Activation</b> [[A]] Focus Activation, [[A]] Operate Activation</p>
<hr style = "margin: 0.5rem 0;" />
<p class = "stat-block-1">This cloak is deep green with a voluminous hood, and is embroidered with gold trim and symbols of significance to the elves. The cloak allows you to cast the <i>ghost sound</i> cantrip as an innate arcane spell. When you draw the hood up over your head (an Interact action), the cloak transforms to match the environment around you and muffles your sounds, giving you an item bonus to Stealth checks. If you activate the cloak, you pull the hood up and are affected by <i>invisibility </i>for 1 minute or until you pull the hood back down, whichever comes first.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Type </b>standard; <b>Level</b> 10; <b>Price</b> 1,000 gp</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">The cloak grants a +3 bonus.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Type </b>greater; <b>Level</b> 18; <b>Price</b> 24,000 gp</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">The cloak grants a +5 bonus, and <i>invisibility</i> is 4th level. If you're also wearing <i>greater boots of elvenkind</i>, the <i>greater cloak of elvenkind</i> allows you to Sneak in forest environments even when creatures are currently observing you.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Here's a fairly complex item to show multiple parts of the system at once. The <i>cloak of elvenkind</i> is level 10, and there's also a <i>greater cloak of elvenkind</i> with an item level of 18. In case you missed it in the <a href="/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkq6?Secrets-of-Alchemy"><b>crafting blog</b></a>, items have levels now, which indicate the point at which you can craft them (as well as being handy for the GM when making treasure hoards). Method of use indicates that this item is worn and that it's a cloak. A few items have this two-part listing because they're hard to wear multiples of. Multiple cloaks, multiple boots... not practical. Multiple rings or amulets? No problem.</p>

<p>This item is both invested (note the invested trait) and activated (as you can see by the activation entry). Investing the cloak lets you cast <i>ghost sound</i>. You get this benefit as long as the cloak is invested, which means you can cast the spell whenever you want without activating the cloak and therefore without spending more Resonance Points. You can also get an item bonus to Stealth checks from the cloak (+3 or +5 for a greater cloak). Finally, you can activate the cloak as you raise the hood, spending 1 Resonance Point to turn invisible! Certainly not every item has as much going on as a <i>cloak of elvenkind</i>, but several classic items seemed like they needed a little extra special treatment! What do you think? Too much?</p>
<p>How about something simpler?</p>

<hr style = "margin: 0.5rem 0;" />
<p class = "stat-block-1">This master-quality light wooden shield (Hardness 6) protects you without requiring you to spend actions each round. When you activate this shield, you can release it from your grip as a part of that action. The shield floats in the air next to you, granting you its bonus automatically, as if you Raised the Shield. Because you're not wielding the shield, you can't use reactions such as Shield Block with the shield.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">After 1 minute, the shield drops to the ground, ending its floating effect. While the shield is adjacent to you, you can grasp it with an Interact action, ending its floating effect.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>You can hold this and use it just like any other shield. Activating it lets you free up a hand to cause the shield to float, where it protects you without you spending an action! While the <i>floating shield </i>offers far less Hardness than many magic shields of a similar level (some have Hardness up to 18!), it's not meant for Shield Block, and its abilities allow you to use it even with a character who needs both hands for other things.</p>

<p>Now let's look at two special types of items: one revamped classic and one brand-new category!</p>

<h2>Staves</h2>
<p>We went through several different iterations of staves. They needed to remain a powerful tool for spellcasters, but we also wanted them to appear earlier in the game so you didn't have to wait for most staves to appear at higher levels. Let's see the <i>staff of healing</i>!</p>

<blockquote>

<p class = "stat-block-title">Staff of Healing <span class = "stat-block-cr">Item 3+</span></p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">Invested, Magical, Necromancy, Staff</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Method of Use</b> held, 1 hand; <b>Bulk</b> 1</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Activation</b> Cast a Spell (1 RP)</p>
<hr style = "margin: 0.5rem 0;" />
<p class = "stat-block-1">Made of smooth white wood, this staff is capped at each end with a golden cross adorned with a multitude of ruby cabochons. A <i>staff of healing</i> adds an item bonus to the Hit Points you restore any time you cast the <i>heal </i>spell using your own spell slots, using charges from the staff, or from channel energy.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Type</b> minor; <b>Level</b> 3; <b>Price</b> 60 gp; <b>Maximum Charges</b> 3</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">The item bonus to <i>heal</i> spells is +1.</p>
<ul>
<li><i> stabilize</i> (cantrip)</li>
<li><i>heal</i> (level 1)</li>
</ul>

</blockquote>

<p>I've included only the level 3 <i>minor staff of healing</i> here. There are also versions at levels 7, 11, and 15, and they add higher-level <i>heal</i> spells, plus <i>restoration</i>, <i>remove disease</i>, <i>restore senses</i>, and more! A staff is tied to you, which means you have to invest it, unlike most held items. This investiture has two extra benefits. First off, it links the staff to you, preventing anyone else from investing the staff for 24 hours. More importantly, it restores charges to the staff equal to the highest level of spell you can cast. You don't have to expend any spells to do this; it's all part of using your Resonance Points. You'll notice this also means that if you find one of these as a 1st-level character, it will take you longer to recharge it than if you're a higher-level spellcaster. You also get the item bonus to healing as long as you hold the invested staff.</p>

<p>Now how do you cast these spells? Well, you activate the staff as part of casting one of the spells in it (spending 1 RP as usual). Then you have two options: You can either expend charges from the staff equal to the spell's level (1 charge for <i>heal</i> here) or expend one of your own spells of that level or higher. Yeah, your staff essentially lets you spontaneously cast the spells in it!</p>

<h2>Trinkets</h2>
<p>How about something completely different? One thing we wanted to add was a type of item that was like scrolls for martial characters. Spellcasters use scrolls and everyone uses potions, but how about something special that relies on nonmagical skills? Trinkets were the answer! Our first example was designed specifically for fighters.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class = "stat-block-title">Fear Gem <span class = "stat-block-cr">Item 4</span></p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">Consumable, Enchantment, Fear, Magical, Mental, Trinket</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Price</b> 11 gp</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Method of Use </b>affixed, weapon;<b> Bulk</b> &mdash;</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Activation</b> [[F]] Focus Activation; <b>Trigger</b> You use Intimidating Strike, but haven't rolled for the attack yet.</p>
<hr style = "margin: 0.5rem 0;" />
<p class = "stat-block-1">Dark smoke seems to writhe within this obsidian gem. When you activate the gem, if your Intimidating Strike hits, the target is frightened 2 and flat-footed against your attacks until the end of your next turn. If the attack roll is a critical success, the target is flat-footed against your attacks for 1 minute.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Trinkets all have the consumable trait, meaning they're used up after being activated once. They have the "affixed" method of use, and as this one indicates, it has to be affixed to a weapon. You can activate it with a Focus Activation as a free action when you use the Intimidating Strike action from the fighter feat of the same name. This makes the Intimidating Strike more severe, increasing its effect to frightened 2 instead of frightened 1 and making it especially strong on a critical success.</p>

<p>Now how about a trinket that's less specific?</p>

<blockquote>

<p class = "stat-block-title">Vanishing Coin <span class = "stat-block-cr">Item 9</span></p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">Consumable, Illusion, Magical, Trinket</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Price</b> 85 gp</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Method of Use</b> affixed, armor; <b>Bulk </b>&mdash;</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Activation</b> [[F]] Focus Activation; <b>Trigger</b> You attempt a Stealth check for initiative, but haven't rolled yet.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Requirements</b> You are a master in Stealth.</p>
<hr style = "margin: 0.5rem 0;" />
<p class = "stat-block-1">This copper coin dangles from a leather strip strung through a hole drilled into the coin's center. It's usually tied just below the throat on a suit of armor. Until it is activated, the coin becomes invisible for a few seconds every few minutes, but always at random intervals. When you activate the coin, you gain the benefits of a 2nd-level <i>invisibility</i> spell until the end of your next turn.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Anyone with master proficiency in Stealth can use this trinket by affixing it to her armor. She can turn invisible by activating the coin when she rolls a Stealth check for initiative. Pretty useful in the first round of a fight!</p>

<p>Well, there's a lot to say about magic items, and we'll have more to say on Friday. For now, I'm going to leave you with a short list of some of the new items appearing in the <i>Pathfinder Playtest Rulebook</i> in addition to the classics.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Anklets of alacrity</i></li>
<li><i>Feather step stone</i></li>
<li><i>Forge warden</i></li>
<li><i>Grim trophy</i></li>
<li><i>Handwraps of mighty fists</i></li>
<li><i>Oil of weightlessness</i></li>
<li><i>Persona mask</i></li>
<li><i>Potency crystal</i></li>
<li><i>Runestone</i></li>
<li><i>Spell duelist's wand</i></li>
<li><i>Third eye</i></li>
<li><i>Virtuoso's instrument</i></li>
</ul>

<p>Tell us what sorts of items you'd like to see in the final rulebook!</p>

<p><i>Illustration by Wayne Reynolds</i></p></div>

<p itemprop="description">Over the years, we have added a wide variety of new rules to Pathfinder First Edition, but none has been so well received as archetypes. It's no surprise that archetypes found such universal appeal. Allowing you to play a more specialized character, they let you play the character you want to play in a way that a single class often cannot support.</p>

<p>When the time came for us to look at archetypes for the Pathfinder Playtest, we knew that we wanted to make them a more integral part of the game, built to be an option from the very beginning. We also wanted to open them up a bit, so we could build archetypes allowing more than one class to access their features and feats, as opposed to having to recreate a concept for every applicable class with an entirely new archetype. This doesn't prevent us from creating more specific archetypes as well, but it opens up the design space further. In opening archetypes up, we realized that they might be easily abused if a player dipped into a variety of archetypes just to grab the best rules bits to make an overpowered character. It was a tough set of challenges, but fortunately for us, the answer was already built into the game.</p>

<p>Archetypes in the Pathfinder Playtest consist of a series of feats you can choose in place of your class feats. Every class gets its feats at roughly every other level, making them a perfect cost for archetypes. So if an archetype appeals to you&mdash;say, the pirate archetype&mdash;the only thing you need to do to gain access to it is take the appropriate dedication feat. Each dedication feat gives you some basic abilities and adds all the rest of that archetype's feats to your list of available class feats. The only catch is that you cannot take another dedication feat until after you have taken a specified number of archetype feats from the first one. So you can dip into a single archetype without too much trouble, but if you want more than one, you really have to put a fair amount of your character into the concept. For example, let's take a look at the pirate archetype.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class = "stat-block-title">Pirate Dedication <span class = "stat-block-cr">Feat 2</span></p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">Archetype, Dedication</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Prerequisites</b> Dexterity 12, trained in Acrobatics and Sailing Lore</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">When you Balance aboard a ship, treat a success as a critical success. You also ignore any difficult terrain, uneven ground, or incline caused by the ship's movement. You are trained with the hatchet, scimitar, and spear. In addition, Acrobatics is a signature skill for you.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Special</b> You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the pirate archetype.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As you can see, this first feat gives you a fair number of advantages while on a boat, certainly helping should combat break out, but you need to take more pirate feats before you can pick up another dedication feat. Let's take a look at two that you might choose.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class = "stat-block-title">Sea Legs <span class = "stat-block-cr">Feat 4</span></p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">Archetype</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Prerequisites</b> Pirate Dedication, trained in Athletics</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">Athletics is a signature skill for you. Whenever you succeed at an Athletics check to Swim, treat your result as a critical success. Additionally, you can always hold your breath for a number of actions equal to double your Constitution score when in water (this is not increased by using the Breathe Deep action).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sea Legs really helps when you are in the water, letting you swim faster and hold your breath longer. It's also a prerequisite for Roll with the Ship, a feat that lets you reroll your Reflex saves when you are on your ship!</p>

<blockquote>
<p class = "stat-block-title">[[AA]] Boarding Action <span class = "stat-block-cr">Feat 6</span></p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">Archetype</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Prerequisites</b> Rope Runner</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">Swing on a rope or Stride up to twice your Speed. As long as you either boarded or disembarked a boat during this movement, make a Strike and deal an extra die of damage if you hit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Boarding Action is one of those feats that nearly every pirate can be expected to have, since setting yourself up to board and pillage the enemy ship is going to be vital! It lets you close the distance to your foes, and if you move from one ship to another during this move, you can make a strike that deals extra damage! It's a bit more limited than the fighter's Sudden Charge, but you deal bonus damage as a benefit if you pull it off.</p>

<p>The pirate archetype has six feats to choose from (in addition to the dedication feat), which gives you plenty of variety if you are looking to explore the archetype before heading to the next one. The great part is that these pirate feats are part of your options list for the rest of your character's career, so you can always go back to pick up a feat that you missed.</p>

<p>Lastly, I want to take a look at prestige archetypes. These are archetypes whose dedication feats come with some pretty hefty prerequisites you have to meet before you can select them. In the <i>Pathfinder Playtest Rulebook</i>, we included only one such archetype as an example for you to play around with in your campaign: the Gray Maiden. Take a look at this dedication feat.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class = "stat-block-title">Gray Maiden Dedication <span class = "stat-block-cr">Feat 6</span></p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">Archetype, Dedication, Prestige</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Prerequisites</b> Strength 16, expert in Fortitude saves, trained in heavy armor and all martial weapons, member of the Gray Maidens</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">Your Gray Maiden training has steeled you against harsh physical conditions. You become a master at Fortitude saves. When you succeed at a Fortitude save, treat it as a critical success. You also gain access to special armor: Gray Maiden plate. Gray Maiden plate is a level 3 item that costs 600 sp, grants +7 AC and +3 TAC, and has a Dexterity modifier cap of +0; otherwise, it uses the same stats as full plate.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Special</b> You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Gray Maiden archetype.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Becoming a master at Fortitude saves is not something you can easily do in most classes; in fact, level 6 is sooner than even a barbarian can manage, and that armor is some of the best you can find. Of course, joining the Gray Maiden organization is no simple feat either. Once you are in, this prestige archetype includes a variety of powerful feats that you can add to your character. Here is just a taste.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class = "stat-block-title">Unbreakable <span class = "stat-block-cr">Feat 8</span></p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">Archetype</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Prerequisites</b> Gray Maiden Dedication</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">You can endure a staggering amount of punishment. Increase your maximum HP by your level, increasing as you gain additional levels. You die at dying 5, or dying 6 if you also have Diehard.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This grants many of the benefits of the Toughness and Diehard general feats combined, and it stacks with both to make an incredibly resilient character.</p>

<p>That wraps up our look at archetypes. You'll find a number of them in the <i>Pathfinder Playtest Rulebook</i>, and we can't wait for you to give them a try. And come back on Monday for a massive blog that I am sure will resonate with many of you!</p>

<div class="blurb180" style="display:none;"><a href="/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180329-Preview2.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180329-Preview2_180.jpeg"></a></div>

<p itemprop = "description">As I write this, I'm deeply wrapped up in design and development on the next major version of the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game&mdash;the new PACG <i>Core Set</i> and the <i>Curse of the Crimson Throne Adventure Path</i>. And while I'll be talking a lot about those in the weeks to come, this seemed like an appropriate time to look at the Ultimate decks, since in some ways they're both the oldest and the youngest PACG expansion material.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, we were putting together the very first Adventure Path. Then, as now, we were deep in development and testing, and it became clear to us that if you all liked the game, we'd be making more someday: more Adventure Paths, more characters, more everything. During a conversation about possible next steps, I pitched to Paizo's Publisher Erik Mona the idea of PACG products built around the expansions to the <i>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game <a href="/products/btpy88yj">Core Rulebook</a></i>&mdash;specifically, <i><a href="/products/btpy8mcz">Ultimate Combat</a></i>, <i><a href="/products/btpy8k8r">Ultimate Magic</a></i>, and <i><a href="/products/btpy8tmc">Ultimate Equipment</a></i>; the <i><a href="/products/btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide</a></i>; and the Bestiaries. It seemed like a natural fit. We bandied about some ideas, and then got back to work on Rise of the Runelords, then Skull &amp; Shackles, Class Decks, and so on.</p>

<p>Fast forward a few years, a few Adventure Paths, and a few (okay, <i>27</i>) Class Decks. We were already looking ahead to a potential revision of the game&mdash;not a new game, but a chance to clean, clarify, and streamline various bumps and corners. This was to be a big project, and in the meantime, there were issues that we wanted to address. Iconics both old and new had yet to officially appear in PACG, and several seasons of organized play had turned some seams and imperfections in the existing class decks into cracks. (To be clear, I intend no disrespect to the class decks! As a developer, there are always "seams and imperfections", and the earliest class decks were built as well as we knew how, but with very little real data to go on.) So it was that, looking at new-ish concerns and expecting potentially large new changes on the horizon, we turned to the old idea of decks based on Pathfinder RPG expansion material, and added a new twist: these decks could also be added to existing class decks. This set would also give us a chance to try out some ideas we had for the upcoming <i>Core Set</i>. As it had when talking to Erik and Vic way back when, it seemed like a natural fit.</p>

<p>Anyone familiar with the Ultimate books knows that they're not all created equal. Each focuses on a different area, with plenty of room for overlap. In this month's <i><a href="/products/btpy9x03">Ultimate Equipment Add-On Deck</a></i>, we wanted very broad coverage&mdash;a deck that could be useful and interesting when combined with a very wide range of characters&mdash;ideally, for anyone who cares about having just the right tool for the job, regardless of the job. To that end, the cards in <i>Ultimate Equipment</i> focus not on the how or the why, but the <i>what</i>. In other words, it's all about the <i>stuff</i>.</p>

<p>For your blog-viewing and card-playing pleasure, we have&hellip;</p>

<p>...stuff for breaking things and/or beings:</p>
<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6831-Deconstructor.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6831-Deconstructor_180.jpeg"></a>
<a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6831-ChainVortex.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6831-ChainVortex_180.jpeg"></a><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6831-Skyrockets.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6831-Skyrockets_180.jpeg"></a>
<br />These are delightful <i>all day long</i>.</p></div>

<p>...stuff to help you find more stuff:</p>
<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6831-ExplorersPithHelmet.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6831-ExplorersPithHelmet_180.jpeg"></a>

<br />Oh, so very stylish!.</p></div>

<p>...even stuff to help you with your other stuff!</p>
<div class = "blurbCenter"></a><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6831-CallPotion.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6831-CallPotion_180.jpeg"></a><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6831-MasterCartman.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6831-MasterCartman_180.jpeg"></a>

<br />Who needs a utility belt when you have spells, friends, or divine intervention?</p></div>

<p>Of course, in PACG, <i>stuff</i> mostly means items, and <i>Ultimate Equipment</i> has scads of 'em. As our general "utility, miscellaneous, other" category, items include a grand number of juicy, desirable cards (something that people are very fond of pointing out to me whenever I bring up <a href="/community/blog/v5748dyo5lhdj">the awesomeness that is Seelah</a>). There are items aplenty no matter what character you're playing, including new items at every adventure number. Here's a peek at new Alchemy, Clothing, and Accessory items!</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6831-DraughtOfDoom.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6831-DraughtOfDoom_180.jpeg"></a>
<a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6831-BootsOfFriendlyTerrain.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6831-BootsOfFriendlyTerrain_180.jpeg"></a><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6831-RingOfElementalCommand.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6831-RingOfElementalCommand_180.jpeg"></a>
<br />As Scoutmaster Scar might say: Be Prepared!</p></div>

<p>Finally (both at the end of the post <i>and</i> after many years of waiting), we get to bring you <a href="/community/blog/v5748dyo5lcfw?Meet-the-Iconics-Reiko">Reiko, the iconic Ninja</a>.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6831-ReikoCharacterFront.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6831-ReikoCharacterFront_360.jpeg"></a>
<a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6831-NinjutsuMaster.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6831-NinjutsuMaster_360.jpeg"></a><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6831-Saboteur.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6831-Saboteur_360.jpeg"></a>
<br />Sadly, I was thwarted in my efforts to introduce this character in Skull &amp; Shackles.</p></div>

<p>You might recognize her as an alternate take on the rogue class, or you might just see a deadly shadow, but either way she should be a fun new option for sneaking, stabbing, and solo-guarding whatever nasty locations show up in your next PACG session.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6831-ReikoCharacterBack.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6831-ReikoCharacterBack_360.jpeg"></a>
<a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6831-Shuriken.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6831-Shuriken_180.jpeg"></a><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6831-Materialize.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6831-Materialize_180.jpeg"></a>
<br />If a ninja vanishes in a combat, is someone already dead?</p></div>

<p>That does it for our peek into <i>Ultimate Equipment</i>. Next month, we'll take the clich&eacute;d "walk on the wild side" with <a href="/products/btpy9xdn"><i>Ultimate Wilderness</i></a>. Until Then!</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline">Divine Intervention</h1>
 
<p class="date">Thursday, June 21, 2018</p>

<div itemprop = "articlebody">

<div class="blurbCenter" style="display:none;"><a href="/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20180531-Card.jpg"><img src="/image/content/Pathfinderrpg/20180531-Card_500.jpeg"></a></div>

<p itemprop="description">When talking about the planes, you can't skip talking about the planes' most powerful entities. So we're going to chat about the gods for a little bit.</p>

<p>In <a href="/products/btpya1am?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Planar-Adventures"><i>Pathfinder Roleplaying Planar Adventures</i></a>, all 20 of the core deities are presented in the book, each with a deity stat block. These stat blocks aren't actual stats for the gods, and they have some of the information you're familiar with from places like <a href="/products/btpy94wj?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Inner-Sea-Gods-Hardcover"><i>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Inner Sea Gods</i></a>. However, the presentation here includes some new things as well. The stat blocks cover things like domains, favored weapons, and sacred animals and colors, but it also helpfully collects information like allies, enemies, holy days, worshipers, minions, and the gods' heralds. The stat blocks also list each of the deities' divine realms and points you to which page in the book features more details on that realm. What's new and exciting about these is that it also includes something new&mdash;divine gifts.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20180621-InvokeDeity.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20180621-InvokeDeity_500.jpeg"></a>
<br /><i>Illustration by Ian Perks</i></p></div>

<p>Divine gifts are boons that gods bestow on devout followers who achieve a legendary task or perform a particularly pious act. These divine gifts are unique to each god or goddess and allow the GM to spice up the rewards in their game. They work as excellent rewards when treasure just doesn't cut it. Divine gifts should only be used rarely or else they run the risk of feeling underwhelming or watering down the experience. If used against players (or used to favor a specific character) using divine intervention has the potential to upset and alienate your players. Divine gifts should be used to forward the story and reward significant events in the narrative of the campaign. As such, they should only be handed out once per player per campaign&mdash;but, hey... as the GM you're the god of the world you present, so you can what you want.</p>

<div class = "blurb360"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20180621-Pharasma.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20180621-Pharasma_360.jpeg"></a>
<br /><i>Illustration by Vlada Hladkova</i></p></div>

<p>Here are a few examples of some divine gifts.</p>

<h3>Pharasma's Divine Gift</h3>
<p>The recipient is not affected by the next effect, damage, or other event that would otherwise kill him.</p>

<h3>Sarenrae's Divine Gift</h3>
<p>As the sun rises over the recipient's home world, he can perform a 10-minute prayer (this may be part of his daily ritual to prepare spells) to invoke the Dawnflower. For the next 24 hours, all healing effects the character generates heal the maximum amount of damage possible. In addition, during this time he can cast <i>breath of life</i> and <i>heal</i> as spell-like abilities 3 times each (CL 20th).</p>

<h3>Torag's Divine Gift</h3>
<p>The recipient can perform a 10-minute prayer (this can be part of her daily ritual to prepare spells) to gain divine insight into defense and strategic situations for the next 24 hours. During this time, the character gains a pool of 20 defense points. She can allocate these points among any number of recipients as untyped bonuses to AC or on saving throws, to a maximum of 5 points per target (a single target can receive this bonus only to AC or to saving throws, not both). She can reallocate these points as a standard action any point during these 24 hours, but each time she does so, the total pool of defense points available for the next allocation is reduced by 5.</p>

<p>That's it for now with all this deity discussion, but a little later I'll be back to talk about some of the other sections of <a href="/products/btpya1am?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Planar-Adventures"><i>Planar Adventures</i></a>.</p>

<p><i>Illustration by Nicolas Espinoza</i></p></div>

<p><a href = "/products/btpya08w?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-1-16-Dreaming-of-the-Future"><em>Starfinder Society #1-16: Dreaming of the Future</em></a> is comes to us from four distinct and skilled new authors. This quest pack contains a set of four quests taking place throughout the Pact Worlds. The PCs travel to Aballon, the Diaspora, Verces, and even the moons of Liavara in search of a hidden repository of lost knowledge. Each quest runs about an hour and can provide shorter gaming experiences for local groups looking for ways to introduce new players to Starfinder. As mentioned, we have some new authors involved in these projects and I'd like to be the first to welcome Natalie Kertzner, Nate Wright, Sasha Lindley Hall, and Tineke Bolleman into our growing family of Starfinder Society freelancers! We're also pleased to feature excellent art by Donald Crank and Nicolas Espinoza, the latter who depicted this enterprising ikeshti to the right.</p>

<p>This scenario has the Quest, Repeatable, and Starship tags.</p>

<p>Our next release is something special for players who've been following the ongoing Scoured Stars season storyline. Veteran freelancer Larry Wilhelm brings us another epic entry into the Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild with <a href = "/products/btpya08x?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-1-17-Reclaiming-the-TimeLost-Tear">Starfinder Society #1-17: Reclaiming the Time-Lost Tear</a>. As our first Tier 5-8 scenario, you can expect a lot of challenging encounters and exploration of heightened threats&mdash;including those illustrated by Graey Erb. I suspect many a player will be uttering the dreaded line, "it could be worse."</p>

<p>This scenario has the Faction (Second Seekers [Luwazi Elsebo]) tag.</p>

<div class = "blurb180"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/StarfinderSociety/PZOSFS0117E-Prima.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/StarfinderSociety/PZOSFS0117E-Prima_180.jpeg"></a>
<p><i>Illustration by Graey Erb</i></p></div>

<p>While far from the final installment in our ongoing Scoured Stars storyline, this tale of adventure and exploration leads directly into our final preview product.</p>



<p><a href = "/products/btpya08y/discuss?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-1-99-The-Scoured-Stars-Invasion">Starfinder Society #1-99: The Scoured Stars Invasion</a>, by well-known Paizo freelancer Mikko Kallio, saw its worldwide debut at Origins. This event is big, as in we're talking trinary star system big. While describing much of this scenario would be a spoiler-ridden minefield, I am pleased to say that it's an event that helps shape the future of the campaign and begins to pivot the Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild's (extended) first season. As a fan of modern television, I'd refer to this event as a strong "mid-season finale" that pays off many of our ongoing story threads, while also seeding some serious new plotlines into the campaign. For those interested in playing it soon, don't fret! There will be additional exclusive runs of this this event at PaizoCon UK and Gen Con 2018. Following Gen Con, this event becomes open for wider release at all qualifying events. If you're concerned about future scenarios spoiling the events of this interactive, we've got you covered&mdash;don't expect any major follow-ups to this event until the September releases!</p>

<p>This scenario has the Exclusive, Faction (Second Seekers [Luwazi Elsebo]), and Starship tags.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/StarfinderSociety/PZOSFS0199E-System.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/StarfinderSociety/PZOSFS0199E-System_360.jpeg"></a></div>

<p>Well that's it from the Starfinder Organized Play team! We'd like to take an opportunity to thank the hard working staff, volunteers, and everyone who played Starfinder (or Pathfinder) game at Origins 2018 (and the fans who voted at the Origins Awards, naming Starfinder RPG the Fan Favorite RPG). While convention season is hectic and filled with long-nights, going to a convention always reminds me about what I really enjoy in our industry: the fans. Getting to talk to people all throughout the convention about Starfinder has re-energized me to get more done. I and the rest of the team renew our dedication in making the Starfinder Roleplaying Guild the best living science-fantasy campaign around.</p>

<p>Until next time,</p>

<p>This month's Tier 1-5 scenario, <a href = "/products/btpya18f?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-9-22-Grotto-of-the-Deluged-God"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #9-22: Grotto of the Deluged God</em></a> from author Gabrielle Harbowy&mdash;author of <a href = "/products/btpy9n4o?Pathfinder-Tales-Gears-of-Faith"><em>Pathfinder Tales: Gears of Faith</em></a>&mdash;takes the PCs to the turbulent waters near the Eye of Abendego in search of the lost ship, Pride of Aspenthar. If that name sounds familiar, it's because this ship disappeared in the events leading up to <a href = "/products/btpy9k92?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-7-19-Labyrinth-of-Hungry-Ghosts"> <em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #7-19: Labyrinth of Hungry Ghosts</em></a>. If you've been wondering about the ultimate fate that befell the rest of the expedition Venture-Captain Calisro Benarry regards as one of her few regrets, you'll want to play this scenario!</p>

<p>For over two years, Venture-Captain Calisro Benarry has struggled with the guilt of sending the Thuvian caravel Pride of Aspenthar on an ill-fated mission from which none of her crew ever returned. While Calisro was able to locate the Aspenthar's final resting place, the fearsome storms and deadly currents around the Eye of Abendego kept her from salvaging the ship and discovering the final fate of her captain and crew. Lately, the weather around the Eye of Abendego has become even more erratic, but the shifting currents have opened a narrow pathway by which a daring crew can reach the lost ship&mdash;and perhaps gain some insight into the recent weather disturbances. In addition to old crimes and dangerous new threats, the PCs will also meet potential allies like this bedraggled fellow on the right, illustrated by Enrique Barajas!</p>

<p>Of course, some adventures are a bit more dangerous and require a more seasoned hero. Our Tier 7-11 offering takes us back to the ruined city of Kadoddi, bringing back old friends and old enemies alike for a final showdown.</p>

<p><a href = "/products/btpya18g?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-9-23-The-GholGan-Heresy"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #9-23: The Ghol-Gan Heresy</em></a> takes place in the Kaava Land's jungles, where the PCs have been summoned to deal with a joint venture between the Aspis Consortium and the Vanji Prospector's Guild that threatens to tear down the final walls of an ancient prison. Building on events from <a href = "/products/btpy9am6?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-6-14-Scions-of-the-Sky-Key-Part-2-Kaava-Quarry"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #6-14: Scions of the Sky Key Part 2: Kaava Quarry</em></a>, <a href = "/products/btpy9s14?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-8-21-Champions-Chalice-Part-2-Agents-of-the-Eye"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-21: Champion's Chalice Part 2: Agents of the Eye</em></a>, and  <a href = "/products/btpy9x0u?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-9-10-Signs-in-Senghor"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #9-10: Signs in Senghor</em></a>, The Ghol-Gan Heresy will require the PCs to navigate the threats of Aspis agents and ancient asurendra in this fearsome climax! Take a look at the danger ahead, as illustrated by Tadas Sidlauskas.</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline">Infused With the Planes</h1>
 
<p class="date">Tuesday, June 19, 2018</p>

<div itemprop = "articlebody">

<div class="blurbCenter" style="display:none;"><a href="/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PathfinderRPG/20180531-Card.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderRPG/Pathfinderrpg/20180531-Card_500.jpeg"></a></div>

<p itemprop="description">In a <a href = "/community/blog/v5748dyo5lktk?Wander-The-Planes">previous blog</a>, I spoke generally about some of number of player-facing rules elements found in <a href = "/products/btpya1am?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Planar-Adventures"><em>Pathfinder RPG Planar Adventures</em></a>, giving rough numbers of different kinds of new mechanics for your characters.</p>

<p>Now I want to dig down a little deeper and talk about something brand new. Amid the archetypes, spells, magic items, and feats, <em>Planar Adventures</em> includes a new type of feats: conduit feats. Here's how the book describes them.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PZO1141-Tail.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PZO1141-Tail_500.jpeg"></a>
<p><i>Illustration by Ian Perks</i></p></div>

<blockquote>
<h3>Conduit Feats</h3>
<p>Conduit feats grant the ability to draw energies from other planes. The effects of conduit feats are supernatural and do not function in an antimagic field or similar effect. In addition, since these abilities require energies from other planes, you cannot use them in areas that are warded against planar or dimensional travel (such as those under the effects of dimensional lock or forbiddance) or when you have been denied this ability (such as via dimensional anchor).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are nearly two dozen conduit feats, the most versatile of which is Planar Infusion. Each of the planes (and demiplanes and dimensions) detailed in Planar Adventures has a stat block listing things you've come to expect like alignment, gravity, time, and how magic works there, but the stat blocks also contain other new pieces of information. One of these is infusions. Infusions are meant to represent how planar energies can affect characters if exposed over a period of time or during a significant event. There are three tiers to infusions: basic, improved, and greater&mdash;each granting powers unlocked by the Planar Infusion, Improved Planar Infusion, and Greater Planar Infusion feats.</p>

<p>As an example, I'll share the infusions for a demiplane near and dear to my heart&mdash;Xibalba.</p>

<div class = "blurb360"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PZO1141-BlackPyramid.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PZO1141-BlackPyramid_360.jpeg"></a>
<p><i>Illustration by Fabio Gorla</i></p></div>

<blockquote>
<h3>Infusions</h3>
<p>Basic The dread horrors of Xibalba infuse your being, and there is little that can further unnerve you. Increase the save DC of fear effects you create by 1, and you gain a +2 bonus on all saving throws against fear effects.</p>
<p>Improved You can use phantasmal killer as a spell-like ability once per day.</p>
<p>Greater You can use insanity as a spell-like ability once per day.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Other conduit feats grant your character unique abilities, all deeply linked to a particular plane of existence. For example, Axiomatic Discourse helps you influence others, Blazing aura wreathes you in flame, Malleable Form converts you to a semi-gelatinous state, and Phasestrike lets you phase out a weapon and resolve attacks as touch attacks. Here's a full example of one of these conduit feats, the wonderfully named Chaos Reigns.</p>

<blockquote>
<h3>Chaos Reigns (Conduit)</h3>
<p>The Abyss dreams of devastation; the slightest taste of its power is an incitement to bare-fisted violence.</p>
<p><b>Prerequisite</b>: Knowledge (planes) 3 ranks.</p>
<p><b>Benefit</b>: As a swift action, you can allow Abyssal wrath to overtake you. While in this state, you can use one of your hands as a slam natural attack that deals 1d6 points of damage (or 1d4 for Small creatures). A creature that does not have hands can instead use a different part of its body to make this slam attack.</p>
<p>You can use this feat's benefit for a number of minutes per day equal to your ranks in Knowledge (planes). These minutes need not be consecutive, but they must be spent in 1-minute increments.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's it for now! Pick up <a href = "/products/btpya1am?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Planar-Adventures"><em>Pathfinder RPG Planar Adventures</em> here on paizo.com</a> or at your local game retailer! Keep your eyes on the blog for more details about <em>Planar Adventures</em>.</p>

<p itemprop="description">The Origins Game Fair took place this past weekend, and we are happy to announce that Starfinder won the Fan Favorite Best Roleplaying Game award at the 2018 Origins Awards on Saturday, presented by the Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts and Design.</p>

<p>We are honored, and humbled, to be chosen as the best RPG of the year by our fans. As game designers, winning any award is always gratifying, but fan-voted awards are especially meaningful. Fans are the people who play our games, and without players, the games themselves don't serve much purpose. We want to thank everyone who voted for Starfinder, as well as every fan who plays Starfinder, talks about the game with friends, and helps make Starfinder's player base a vibrant community.</p>

<p>We also want to thank everyone involved in the creation of the game. This was very much a team effort on a massive scale, and involved some of the most involved collaborative work we've ever done. The Starfinder design team, creative directors, developers, editors, authors, artists, art directors, and graphic designers all did an amazing amount of work to make this game happen. And even beyond that, everyone at Paizo took on some of the herculean workload needed to put the physical book in the hands of players.</p>

<p>Looking forward to the future, we plan to continue creating more exciting content for Starfinder in the months and years to come, and we can't wait for you to see what we have planned. Keep aiming for the stars!</p>

  <h1>Monk Class Preview</h1>
  <p class="date"><time datetime="2018-06-18T21:00:00Z">Jun 18, 2018, 02:00 pm</time></p>
  <p itemprop="description">Monks choose whether their key ability is Strength or Dexterity, which will determine the DC of some of their abilities. Their selection of initial proficiencies looks pretty different from most classes! First off, they have expert proficiency in all their saving throws. Monks aren't trained in any weapons, but they <i>are</i> trained in all unarmed attacks. They also get powerful fist, which increases the damage die of their fists and lets them make lethal strikes without penalty when using normally nonlethal unarmed attacks. Further, they're untrained in armor, but get graceful expertise at 1st level, which gives them expert proficiency in unarmored defense (everybody else is only trained).</p>

<p>Some players love to play monks so they can strive toward enlightenment. Others just like to punch stuff!</p>

<h2>Monk Features</h2>

<p itemprop="description">Monks choose whether their key ability is Strength or Dexterity, which will determine the DC of some of their abilities. Their selection of initial proficiencies looks pretty different from most classes! First off, they have expert proficiency in all their saving throws. Monks aren't trained in any weapons, but they <i>are</i> trained in all unarmed attacks. They also get powerful fist, which increases the damage die of their fists and lets them make lethal strikes without penalty when using normally nonlethal unarmed attacks. Further, they're untrained in armor, but get graceful expertise at 1st level, which gives them expert proficiency in unarmored defense (everybody else is only trained).</p>

<p>They get one last class feature at 1st level, of course: Flurry of Blows! This is a single action that can be used once per round to make two strikes using an unarmed attack. If both hit, their damage is combined. Both these attacks take the multiple attack penalty normally, so usually the monk will be making the second attack at a -4 penalty (since a fist is agile). Flurry of Blows is a huge advantage, letting the monk attack up to four times in a round, or letting the monk have plenty of actions to move and attack in a single turn. Speaking of moving, at 3rd level, a monk gains incredible movement, increasing his speed as long as he's not wearing armor. This starts at a 10-foot increase, and it goes up by 5 feet every 3 levels.</p>

<div class = "blurb360"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20180618-Sajan.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20180618-Sajan_360.jpeg"></a>
<p><i>Illustration by Wayne Reynolds</i></p></div>

<p>Because monks can defend themselves in so many different ways, we wanted to let the monk pick how his saving throws improve. His saves increase at 7th level through the path to perfection class feature, which lets him increase a save's proficiency rank to master. The second path to perfection, at 11th level, lets a monk treat any successful save as a critical success instead, as long as he has master proficiency in that save. The monk gets his third path to perfection at 15th level, which he can use to either increase his proficiency rank in another save to master proficiency or progress his proficiency at a save in which he's already a master to legendary.</p>

<p>The monk's unarmored defense proficiency also goes up as he levels, first to master at 13th level and then to legendary at 17th. You'll notice that monks no longer add their Wisdom modifiers to AC, which is due to a few factors. First, depending on the monk's Dexterity modifier, the gulf between a heavily armored character and a monk without armor is extremely low, so adding even more bonuses would put the monk really far ahead. Second, adding more than a single ability modifier to a check or DC now really distorts the game. Third, we have another role for Wisdom to play in the class, and wanted it to be optional so monks aren't dependent on many different ability scores, giving you more flexibility with how you can build a monk character.</p>

<p>Of course, it goes without saying that the monk's unarmed attacks get better as he levels up. Magic strikes, at 3rd level, makes the monk's unarmed attacks magical, and increases his proficiency rank to expert. At 5th level, metal strikes causes them to be treated as cold iron and silver; at 17th level, adamantine strikes makes them act as adamantine. Fierce flurry, at 9th level, increases the damage dice of a Flurry of Blows by one step whenever both strikes hit. At 19th level, the monk has developed perfected form, meaning that when he makes an unarmed attack, he can treat any die roll lower than 10 as if he had rolled a 10! This lets the monk plow through weaker enemies who can't handle his immaculate fighting style, and against bosses, he can even turn a good number of misses into hits.</p>

<h2>Monk Feats</h2>
<p>A monk's feats let him expand how he can attack, teach him special martial arts techniques, let him develop an entire fighting style, or use magic called ki (which we explain in the Ki section).</p>

<p>Your monk could take Monastic Weaponry at 1st level, letting him use his unarmed attack proficiencies, as well as any monk abilities that normally work with unarmed attacks, with simple and martial monk weapons. This is how Sajan gets to use that sweet temple sword! If you'd rather stick with punches, kicks, knees, and headbutts, take a look at Brawling Focus at 4th level, which gives you the critical specialization effect for anything in the brawling weapon group. This means if you critically hit with your unarmed attacks, the target might be slowed 1 on its next turn, losing 1 action.</p>

<p>Some of the special attacks you can learn include Stunning Fist, a great option if you're looking to recreate your Pathfinder First Edition monk. A Stunning Fist strike takes 2 actions and you make an unarmed strike; if the strike deals damage, the target has to succeed at a Fortitude save against your class DC (based on your Strength or Dex, remember?) or be flat-footed for 1 round, or stupefied 2 if it critically fails. So how do you stun the target? If your strike is a critical hit, the target's saving throw result is treated as one category worse, and if it critically fails its save it's stunned for 1 round! At 4th level, you can pick up Deflect Arrow, a reaction that gives you a +4 bonus to AC against a ranged weapon attack, or Flying Kick, which lets you use 2 actions to jump and make a strike at the end of your jump. You can even Long Jump&mdash;normally 2 actions&mdash;as part of your Flying Kick, potentially moving <i>very</i> far before your strike. Other attacks include Ghost Strike, which lets you use 2 actions to target TAC, or Wall Run, which lets you run up vertical surfaces at your full Speed.</p>

<p>Now what about fighting styles? Let's look at one that starts with the Crane Stance feat at 1st level! A stance takes one action to enter, and can be used only in an encounter. You typically stay in a stance until you enter another stance or get knocked out. In Crane Stance, you gain a +1 bonus to AC and get better at jumping, but the only Strikes you can make are crane wing attacks. What the heck are those? Well, many stances give special unarmed attacks that have statistics much like weapons. Crane wing attacks deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage, and have the agile, finesse, nonlethal, and unarmed traits. They're not too different from normal fist strikes, but others differ more; for instance, heavy dragon tail attacks deal 1d10 bludgeoning damage and have the backswing trait instead of agile or finesse. What if Crane Stance isn't enough? Well, you can pick up Crane Flutter, a reaction that increases your AC against a melee attack and lets you immediately riposte with a crane wing strike at a -4 penalty if the triggering attack misses. Each of the stances in the <em>Playtest Rulebook</em> has one special attack tied to it, but I could see us expanding on them in the future, couldn't you? If you really get into stances, you can pick up Master of Many Styles at 16th level, which lets you enter a stance as a free action at the start of each of your turns.</p>

<h2>Ki</h2>
<p>Oh, geez, I'm running long, huh? Let's make this quick. You know how I said there's a role for Wisdom? Well, that's where ki powers come into play. And when I say powers, I mean powers&mdash;they're spells just like other powers (such as the wizard's school powers or the cleric's domain powers). You gain access to ki by picking up the first ki power feat, Ki Strike, which gives you a pool of Spell Points equal to your Wisdom modifier, which you can spend to cast <i>ki strike</i>. This power is a Verbal Casting free action you can use when making an unarmed strike to get a +1 bonus to your attack roll. So you let out a shout and hit better!</p>

<p>Now that you have Spell Points, you can expand your repertoire of powers to teleport with Abundant Step, fire a cone of force with a Ki Blast, or kill someone with Quivering Palm. Quivering Palm costs 2 Spell Points, and as with the monk's other Spell Point abilities, taking the 16th-level feat to get this spell increases your Spell Point pool by 2. Let's take a look, and then I'm outta here (probably flying away using the <i>wind jump</i> power)!</p>

<blockquote>
<p class = "stat-block-title">Quivering Palm <span class = "stat-block-cr">Power 8</span></p>
<p>Attack, Necromancy<br />
<b>Casting</b> [[A]] Somatic Casting, [[A]] Verbal Casting<br />
<b>Duration</b> 1 month</p>

<p>Make a melee unarmed Strike, dealing damage normally. If you succeed and the target is alive, anytime during the duration you can spend a Verbal action to speak a word of death that could instantly slay it, depending on its Fortitude save.</p>
<p><b>Success</b> The target survives, the spell ends, and the target is bolstered against it.<br />
<b>Failure</b> The target is stunned for 1 round but survives. The spell's duration continues, but the target is bolstered against being killed by <i>quivering palm</i> for 24 hours.<br />
<b>Critical Failure</b> The target dies.</p>
<p>If you cast <i>quivering palm</i> again, any previous <i>quivering palm</i> you had cast ends.</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline">Free RPG Day and the Big Purple Golem</h1>
 
<p class="date">Wednesday, June 13, 2018</p>

<div itemprop = "articlebody">

<div class="blurbCenter" style="display:none;"><a href="/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20180616-Preview.jpg"><img src="/image/content/Pathfinderrpg/20180616-Preview_500.jpeg"></a></div>

<p itemprop="description">Today is Free RPG Day! Participating hobby game retail locations and industry publishers will be giving away free adventures and other materials so that gamers can try new games and play exclusive content together. This year Paizo has contributed three special products.</p>

<p>The first thing we're providing is the next adventure in the We Be Goblins series featuring the hijinks of Chuffy, Mogmurch, Poog, and Reta&mdash;<a href="/products/btpya1au?Pathfinder-Module-We-Be-5uper-Goblins"><i>Pathfinder Module: We Be 5uper Goblins</i></a> by our own Crystal Frasier. The brainstorm meeting for this adventure was easily one of the funniest meetings I've ever attended, which was super welcome because we'd all had a few really stressful weeks at that time. Here are a few words from Crystal about her zany adventure.</p>

<div class = "blurb360"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20180616-SquealyNord.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20180616-SquealyNord_360.jpeg"></a>
<br /><i>Artist: Oksana Federova</i></p></div>

<blockquote>
<p>"Goblins win! Goblins reign! Goblins venture &lsquo;cross the planes!</p>

<p>There's not a lot our intrepid goblin hero-chiefs&mdash;Reta, Chuffy, Mogmurch, and Poog&mdash;haven't done at this point. They've conquered vicious halflings, slain literate cannibals, bested ogres, and battled terrifying harpies! They've grown from mere whelps to big bad hero-chiefs! What's left?</p>

<p>Maybe travelling the planes and fighting a vicious dragon?</p>
<p><i>We Be 5uper Goblins</i> is the capstone for the We Be Goblins series, dropping everyone's favorite anarchists into a strange new setting where they need their wits and strong stomachs to survive.</p>
<p>Goblin adventures are always fun to write, because you can play with weird, fun ideas and bend the rules more than you can in a typical Pathfinder adventure, so I'm always happy when they come around. It turns the typical adventure dynamic on its head; you assume, on some level, that adventurers because they want to do "good" and they want to get rich. But goblins adventure because they want to do "crime" and get fed! Those two simple words open up lots of weird, fun new encounters, and I hope your players utterly break the narrative presented in this book for this year's Free RPG Day! I know mine did."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The next exciting thing you'll find at your local retailer is a short adventure for Starfinder&mdash;<a href="/products/btpya1aa?Starfinder-Skitter-Shot"><i>Starfinder Module: Skitter Shot</i></a>, featuring the colorful, lovable, and helpful six-armed skittermanders. Our own Jason Keeley wrote this adventure, and I tracked him down in the far reaches of space to get a few words about his adventure.</p>


<div class = "blurb360"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/20180616-Quonx.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/20180616-Quonx_360.jpeg"></a>
<br /><i>Artist: Graey Erb</i></p></div>

<blockquote>
<p>"Hihello, nufriends! Today, you'll finally be able to get all of your hands on Starfinder's Free RPG Day offering,<a href="/products/btpya1aa?Starfinder-Skitter-Shot"><i>Skitter Shot</i></a> and see what happens when you point a quartet of skittermanders at a problem and say, "Go help!" The four fuzzy friends will need to work together to defeat a rogue artificial intelligence aboard a luxury cruise ship, and will hopefully come out the other end with all their limbs intact.</p>
  
<p>When we decided skittermanders would be the focus, we took the opportunity to not only give you a fun and wacky adventure, but to illustrate our vision for the hyperactive creatures. Since they appeared in <i>Starfinder Alien Archive</i>, skittermanders have certainly captured most everyone's imaginations! And so, to further stoke those fires, <i>Skitter Shot </i>presents detailed backstories of the four skittermander pregens, each with a fun piece of skittermander slang that you can work into your everyday Starfinder conversations. But that's not all, the inside back cover of the book features a list of ten fun facts about skittermanders that will give you insight into their society and personal relations.</p>
  
<p>Like any good skittermander, WE only want to help YOU."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lastly, players can add some ferocious goblin fun to their to Pathfinder Adventure Card Game with <a href="/products/btpya1be?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Promo-Card-NokNok">Nok-Nok</a>. This fully playable character, complete with role and token cards, will be released for Free RPG Day 2018. Nok-Nok may be used with any <a href="/store/pathfinder/adventureCardGame">Pathfinder Adventure Card Game</a> set.</p>

<p>As in past years, the new Free RPG Day module is also sanctioned for the organized play campaign, and we've released the sanctioning document so that GMs have a chance to read over it and print out Chronicle sheets. You can find links to these downloads on the product pages, but we've also gathered them here to make things easy on you. If you're planning on playing the adventure, it's best to not check out the sanctioning documents. No one wants spoilers!</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/include/PZO9500-12-Rules.zip">We Be 5uper Goblins sanctioning document</a></li>

<li><a href="/include/PZO9500-13-Pregens.zip">Skitter Shot Pregens</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Did you oversleep and miss getting your hands on our offerings for Free RPG Day? Were you not able make it down to a store? Were no retailers in your area participating in this awesome day? Don't fret!</p>

<p>Physical copies of the adventures and the Nok-Nok card will be available for purchase here on paizo.com starting on July 1st, which is also the same time that you can come back here and download a free PDF of the adventures.</p>

<p>We hope everyone has a fun-filled Free RPG Day!</p>

<p class="date">Friday, June 15, 2018</p>

<div itemprop="articleBody">

<div class="blurbCenter" style="display: none;"><a href="/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20180409-Card.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20180409-Card_360.jpeg"></a></div>

<p itemprop="description">Conditions were a significant part of Pathfinder First Edition, giving a set package of rules to effects like being blinded or fatigued. You might be wondering what kind of condition our conditions are in!</p>

<p>For the playtest, we've expanded conditions to cover a little more ground in two different directions. In one direction, now any long-lasting effect can impose a condition on a character. These conditions might be defined by a specific spell or ability, and often include a specific type of bonus or penalty called a conditional bonus or conditional penalty. This broadens our definitions so that more rules can now speak to conditions as ongoing effects. In the other direction, we've expanded on the conditions from First Edition to create a solid set of basic conditions for the playtest. Some of these conditions cover common benefits, allowing us to clarify how multiple effects combine. For example, the accelerated condition increases your speed by a certain value, and the hampered condition decreases your speed by a certain value. You use only the highest accelerated value you have&mdash;it's not cumulative. So if one effect made you accelerated 5 and another made you accelerated 10, your speed would increase by 10 feet, not 15. Many other conditions are quite similar to those you're familiar with, such as blinded or paralyzed (plus some rules tweaks, of course).</p>

<p>Some of our other conditions speak directly to the new action system for the game. The two big ones here are quick and slowed, which increase and decrease your number of actions. When you're quick, you gain one extra action per turn that you can use in one or more ways, according to the effect that made you quick! For instance, a 20th-level monk with Enduring Quickness is permanently quick, and can use the extra action to Stride, to Leap, or as part of a High Jump or Long Jump. The <i>haste</i> spell makes its target quick, and lets them use the extra action to Stride or Strike. So, if our 20th-level monk benefited from <i>haste</i>, he would add Strike to his list of options for the extra action from the quick condition as long as the <i>haste</i> spell was in effect. Conversely, slowed removes actions and prevents the creature from readying actions. This, like accelerated above, is an example of a condition that comes with a condition value to indicate how severe the condition is. So, a creature that becomes slowed 1 loses 1 action per turn, a slowed 2 creature loses 2, and so on. These aren't cumulative, so if your barbarian gets slowed 2 by one creature and slowed 1 by another, she loses only 2 actions.</p>

<p>Let's look at some other conditions that have condition values! The frightened condition has a higher value the more scared you are, and this value is also the conditional penalty you take to your checks and saving throws. So if you're frightened 2, you take a &ndash;2 penalty to checks and saves. There's some good news, though, because fear tends to pass after the initial shock. Frightened's condition value decreases by 1 at the end of each of your turns, until it reaches 0 and goes away. This condition covers all types of fear, so there's no more shaken or panicked. Frightened doesn't automatically make you run away, but some effects give you the fleeing condition as well, potentially for as long as you remain frightened! The sick condition is similar to frightened in that it gives you a penalty to the same rolls, but it's more severe for two reasons. First off, you're too sick to drink anything&mdash;including potions! Moreover, it doesn't go away on its own. Instead, you have to spend an action retching in an attempt to recover, which lets you attempt a new save to end the sickness.</p>

<p>Some conditions reflect the relationship between one character and another&mdash;for instance, when you're concealed or flat-footed. In the office, we call these relative conditions (as opposed to absolute conditions, like stunned or deafened, that don't involve others). The two examples I gave are pretty straightforward. The flat-footed condition gives a &ndash;2 circumstance penalty to AC. Some things make you flat-footed to everyone, but usually you're flat-footed to a creature that's flanking you or that otherwise has the drop on you. With the new critical rules, that 2 points of AC can make a big difference. Plus, rogues can sneak attack flat-footed targets! The concealed condition works much like concealment used to&mdash;an attacker has to succeed at a DC 5 flat check to hit you. In the playtest, flat checks have replaced miss chances and other things that might fail or succeed regardless of skill. Attempting a flat check is like any other d20 roll against a DC, except that no modifiers alter your result, so you need to roll a 5 or higher on the die or you just miss.</p>

<p>Some effects that used to deal ability damage now impose new conditions instead. Enfeebled imposes a conditional penalty on attack rolls, damage rolls, and Strength-based checks equal to the enfeebled condition's value. Sluggish is similar, but for Dexterity-based values: AC, attack rolls, Dexterity-based checks, and Reflex saves. The stupefied condition covers mental effects, imposing a conditional penalty on spell DCs as well as on Intelligence-, Wisdom-, and Charisma-based checks. It also requires you to attempt a special roll each time you cast a spell or else your spell is disrupted (meaning you lose the spell!). Because the penalty from stupefied also applies to this roll, the worse the stupefied condition's value, the harder it gets to cast spells!</p>

<p>Finally, let's look at one of the conditions used frequently by the barbarian, as shown in <a href="/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkui?Barbarian-Class-Preview">Monday's blog</a>. When you're fatigued, you're hampered 5 (the opposite of accelerated, so your speed is decreased), and you take a &ndash;1 conditional penalty to your AC and saving throws. Furthermore, your fatigue means everything takes more effort to do, so when you're fatigued, each action you use on your turn worsens this conditional penalty by 1 until the start of your next turn. So if you use all three actions on your turn when you're fatigued, your defenses are at a &ndash;4 penalty! In the barbarian's case, the fatigue from a rage goes away pretty quickly, but if you get fatigued from another source, it typically takes a night's rest to recover.</p>

<p>Are you looking forward to playing with these conditions? What do you think about the change to flat-footed? What conditions do you dread the most?</p>

<p>We have lots of tables of Season of Factions' Favor running in the Hyatt's Franklin Ballroom. You can play them at these times:</p>

<table class = "table-spacing-large">
<tr><td><b>Thursday</b></td><td>8:00 AM</td><td>10:00 AM</td><td>1:00 PM</td><td>3:00 PM</td><td>5:00 PM</td><td>7:00 PM</td></tr>

<p>You can find me hanging out with PACG developers Keith Richmond and Paul Peterson at the Lone Shark Games booth, #235. Paul and I will also join James Ernest for our annual Origins by Night podcast every night of the show from the Big Bar on 2, just a few feet from the Pathfinder games. Come say hi!</p>

<p>We'll also be bringing a copy of the playtest set for next year's PACG Core Set. I don't know how many games we'll be able to get in while we're there&mdash;there's a lot going on at the show&mdash;but whenever we have time, we'll bring it over to the PACG area and playtest with you.</p>

<p>We'll have promo cards to sign and a first look at our Free RPG Day promo character...</p>

<h2>Nok-Nok&hellip; He's Here</h2>
<p>A while back we revealed Nok-Nok, our fifth goblin promo character for <a href="http://freerpgday.com" target = "_blank">Free RPG Day</a>. That's an annual event where gamers around the world play hobby games all day long. More than a dozen companies provide free products for participating retailers to give out, and Paizo is no exception. In addition to the modules <a href="/products/btpya1au?Pathfinder-Module-We-Be-5uper-Goblins"><em>We Be 5uper Goblins!</em></a> for the Pathfinder RPG and <a href="/products/btpya1aa?Starfinder-Skitter-Shot"><em>Skitter Shot</em></a> for Starfinder, we've got <a href="/products/btpya1be?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Promo-Card-NokNok">Nok-Nok</a> for PACG.</p>

<p>Nok-Nok is from the upcoming <a href="https://owlcatgames.com" target = "_blank"><em>Pathfinder: Kingmaker</em></a> CRPG. My birthday-twin Chris Avellone wrote a bunch of stuff for that game, and so we wanted to honor him by including Nok-Nok in our world. Here's Nok-Nok in all his glory.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180613-NokNok.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180613-NokNok_180.jpeg"></a>
<a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180613-Token.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180613-Token_180.jpeg"></a>
<p><i>When someone asks you if you're a god, you say yes.</i></p></div>

<p>We especially like the central mechanic on Nok-Nok: that he cares how many of what are in his location deck. Sure, every character does. But Nok-Nok is especially good at gaining value from cards that aren't even flipped over from the location deck yet. It's kind of awesome to watch.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180613-HeadDrum.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180613-HeadDrum_360.jpeg"></a>
<a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180613-FifthGawd.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180613-FifthGawd_360.jpeg"></a>
</div>

<p>Also, Nok-Nok may not be every goblin's goblin. The other goblins use his head as a drum, which does not endear them to Nok-Nok. If you want a goblin to solo through the first adventures in Rise of the Runelords or Season of the Runelords, Nok-Nok's your man. Er, goblin. If you can't get your hands on Nok-Nok on Free RPG Day, don't fear! We'll be sending him out for free along with <a href="/products/btpy8x6n?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Subscription">PACG subscription shipments</a> of <a href="/products/btpy9xdn?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Ultimate-Wilderness-AddOn-Deck">Ultimate Wilderness</a> in July; non-subscribers will be able to purchase him from paizo.com starting August 2.</p>

<p>We're hoping to see you at Origins and on Free RPG Day! Thanks for playing!</p>

<p>This month sees the release of <a href="/products/btpya1am?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Planar-Adventures"><i>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Planar Adventures</i></a>, but there's far more to the planes than could ever be covered in a single book. <a href="/products/btpya1b8?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Distant-Realms"><i>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Distant Realms</i></a> offers a closer look at six planar cities that characters can visit, either as a jumping point into the planes or as adventure locations in their own right. Several previous previews have revealed the identities of many of those six cities; some brave adventurers may have already set foot in them before.</p>

<p><i>Illustration by Federico Musetti</i></p></div>

<p>But before we get into describing the cities and outlining all of their most interesting adventure spots, I wanted to offer a more organic impression of these fantastic locales. So imagine you have just stepped out of a portal or off of a luxurious howdah on the back of an astral whale, and look out onto the superbly illustrated vistas that make up your first view of these cities. Or, if you're the less adventurous type, imagining opening your mailbox to find a postcard with one of these landscapes printed on the front, along with the phrase "Wish You Were Here!" Of course, <i>which</i> particular landscape is printed on your postcard might give a different tone to those words!</p>

<h2>James Case, Editor</h2>
<p>Hi everyone! I'm James, and I'm a recent addition to the editing team.</p>

<p>I just moved here to the Seattle area after six years overseas in Tokyo, where I edited biomedical research. It's quite a change being back stateside, but as a longtime player and GM who's been playing Pathfinder since its playtest, I'm super excited to be in the editor's chair, helping to make the games I love alongside the rest of the awesome people here at Paizo.</p>

<p>When I'm not RPing, I can be usually be found translating and reviewing Japanese music with my headphones in or blowing giant soap bubbles in a park. Occasionally both at the same time!</p>

<h2>Leo Glass, Editor</h2>
<p>Hi! I'm Leo Glass, an editor at Paizo. I'm honored and humbled to be a part of this amazing team.</p>

<p>I've worked as an editor or writer for the last seven years. Most recently, I edited research grants at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Before that, I worked as a writer/designer at an independent PC game studio.</p>

<p>My passion for tabletop RPGs was born during college, when my best friend invited me to play an adventure. While I loved fantasy and science fiction, I didn't know a critical hit from a Fortitude save. Once my first character, an elven monk, survived his first dungeon, I was hooked. Fifteen years later, I've played in or GMed more than 25 different RPG systems. It's this hunger for all things tabletop that inspired my love affair with Pathfinder and Starfinder.</p>

<p>Besides RPGs, I write short fiction and enjoy cycling, gaming, graphic design, hiking, and reading. I also have a cat named Pixel. I recently moved to Seattle from Nebraska, only to discover that I forgot my umbrella, so if you see me around Redmond doing my best wet dog impression, now you know why.</p>

<h2>Adrian Ng, Editor</h2>
<p>Hi, everyone! My name's Adrian Ng. I grew up in northwest Ohio, and I moved to Seattle in 2013. Prior to working at Paizo, I was a game tester and copy editor at Nintendo of America. I began working at Paizo about a year ago as a temporary editor and was hired on as a full-time editor after PaizoCon 2017. When I'm not gaming, I enjoy making music, running and hiking, and consuming speculative fiction in all forms. Glad to meet you all!</p>

<h2>Lacy Pellazar, Editor</h2>
<p>Hi! I'm Lacy, and I've actually been at Paizo for a year now! After editing for a little over 4 years at Nintendo of America, I joined Paizo last year to work on the Starfinder Core Rulebook, and it's been a blast (get it? Like rockets?) ever since. Some of my favorite things include: birds, bugs/arachnids (yes, even spiders. ESPECIALLY SPIDERS), cyberpunk, horror/paranormal, and Pok&eacute;mon. If you like video games, self-deprecating humor, and some occasional art, feel free to follow me over on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/mahousloth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@mahousloth</a>!</p>

<h2>Jason Tondro, Editor</h2>
<p>Hey everybody. I've spent the last five years as an English professor at a small state college in Georgia, where I taught writing, film, British Lit, and comics &amp; graphic novels. But I've been gaming since I was 11 and freelancing in the RPG business for twenty years. Along the way I have written for Hero System, Middle Earth Role Playing, Steve Jackson Games, Mutants &amp; Masterminds, Icons, 3e, and most recently Fate Core.</p>

<p>But like some others here at Paizo, I finally decided to turn my second job into my first job and work with RPGs full time. I'm originally from California and moving back to the West Coast&mdash;where I have many old friends and an amazing new job here at Paizo&mdash;has turned out to be just what I needed. This is a fantastic, artistically inspiring, community and coming here has felt like coming home.</p>

<p class="date">Monday, June 11, 2018</p>

<div itemprop="articleBody">

<div class="blurbCenter" style="display: none;"><a href="/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20180611-Preview.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20180611-Preview_360.jpeg"></a></div>

<p itemprop="description">Rage consumes you in battle. You delight in carving through your enemies using powerful weapons and wreaking havoc without needing complicated techniques or rigid training, and you rely on your astonishing durability to get you through a fight. You associate your rage with a traditional symbol of affinity known as a totem, which might take the form of an animal, a spirit, or even a part of yourself. To many barbarians, brute force is a hammer and every problem looks like a nail; to others, the dark emotions within them are something to hold back and release only when it matters most.</p>

<p>When it came to barbarians in the playtest, we wanted to take the most popular parts of the original barbarian and the unchained barbarian and brew them together with a few special ingredients to make the class even more flexible to fit even more roleplaying and mechanical concepts. Let's take a look!</p>

<h2>Rage</h2>
<p>Rage is a barbarian's key class feature. Barbarians aren't super-trained in fancy weapon techniques like most of the other martial classes. Instead, a barbarian can enter a rage that drastically increases her damage and grants her a significant booster shot of temporary Hit Points, in exchange for a &ndash;1 penalty to AC and the inability to use concentrate actions unless they specifically have the rage trait (note, this means that somatic-only spells are now possible in a rage!). Unlike in Pathfinder First Edition, rage in the playtest is not limited in rounds per day&mdash;let's be honest, in Pathfinder First Edition, our barbarians never ran out of rounds anyway once they had gained a few levels. A rage lasts 3 rounds, followed by a round of fatigue. While you're fatigued, you can't rage again, but once that round has passed, you can enter a new rage, with a shiny brand-new set of temporary Hit Points to go along with it. You can do this as often as you need during the day!</p>

<div class = "blurb360"><a href = "//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20180611-Amiri.jpg"><img src = "//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20180611-Amiri_360.jpeg"></a>
<p><i>Illustration by Wayne Reynolds</i></p></div>

<h2>Totems</h2>
<p>Without a doubt, the most popular element of barbarians in Pathfinder First Edition is the totem, introduced in the <a href="/products/btpy8fo1?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Players-Guide"><i>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Advanced Player Guide</i></a>. These totems are a set of three thematically linked abilities the barbarian can choose, starting at 2nd level. In the playtest, you get a totem right away at 1st level. Your totem is a representation of how and why you rage and grants you an initial ability, access to more totem feats down the line, and, at 9th level, resistance equal to your Constitution modifier against a specific type of damage. Each totem also has its own anathema, most of which are relatively low impact and designed to create roleplaying hooks. For instance, the giant totem's anathema states that you cannot fail to accept a personal challenge of your strength, much like how Amiri accepted the challenging task her tribal fellows set her to slay a frost giant. Some though, are stricter&mdash;the superstition totem requires that you never willingly accept the benefits of spells, but grants you some truly astounding antimagic abilities in exchange.</p>

<p>Some of the totems, like animal totem, giant totem, and dragon totem, offer a few abilities that are flat-out magical. For instance, animal totem barbarians can adopt animal features and attacks and even transform into an animal (a great way to represent lycanthrope characters), whereas dragon totem barbarians gain a dragon breath attack can even grow wings. Even though totems are popular and roleplaying opportunities are fun, we recognize not everyone necessarily <i>wants</i> to commit to them, so we also offer the fury totem, which has no anathema or special requirements and focuses more on barbarian feats that aren't tied to any totem, which we'll look at in a bit. But first...</p>

<h2>Additional Barbarian Features</h2>
<p>Though I called out rage and totems specifically, the barbarian has some really neat abilities beyond those. For instance, at level 3, barbarians gain critical specialization effects when in a rage, even if they don't fulfill the usual proficiency rank requirement for the weapon&mdash;they use whatever weapon is most efficient to express their rage! One other thing they have that nobody else does: 12 Hit Points per level. Add that to the substantial temporary Hit Points that they can generate (possibly multiple times in a long fight) and the resistances from their totem that kick in at level 9, and barbarians have incredible staying power. Sure, they don't prevent as many hits as a paladin or a shield fighter might, but they can stand there taking hits long past the point where anyone else could stay standing. This is also a good point to mention one feature barbarians don't have in the playtest: alignment requirements. Barbarians can be whatever alignment they want; for instance, a lawful barbarian might act like one of the concepts I described earlier, controlling and holding back her emotions to channel and release her rage when it matters most.</p>

<p>As many of you have predicted, barbarians also have the best Fortitude proficiency, gaining the juggernaut class feature at level 7 (which grants master proficiency in Fortitude and the ability to count any successes you roll as critical successes instead) and improved juggernaut at 13th (which grants legendary proficiency and removes the chance of critically failing), but they also have a secondary Will focus, gaining indomitable will at 15th level to become masters in Will. Tireless rage comes in at level 17 to allow barbarians to ignore fatigue after ending a rage (though they still must wait the normal amount of time before entering a new rage). Barbarians are all about brutalizing opponents without worrying about carrying lots of different weapons and selecting the right one for the job with their monster knowledge, so it makes sense that they gain the ability to rip through a chunk of resistances automatically with level 19's devastating strikes ability. Possibly my favorite barbarian feature, though, is the level 11 ability mighty rage&mdash;whenever you enter a rage, it allows you to immediately use one of your rage-only actions for free. So many possibilities!</p>

<h2>Barbarian Feats</h2>
<p>In addition to the feats based on totems, there are a variety of other feats available, from the bread-and-butter, low-level Sudden Charge to the devastating Whirlwind Strike (attack everything in your reach), Brutal Critical (your critical hits deal an extra die of damage as well as persistent bleed damage), Vicious Evisceration (you maim the enemy, dealing extra damage, reducing its maximum HP by an amount equal to its level, and giving it a &ndash;1 penalty to Fortitude), Contagious Rage (one of your allies gets the benefits and &ndash;1 penalty to AC imposed by your rage, but can still concentrate), and Quaking Stomp (you stomp so hard that it creates an honest-to-goodness earthquake). But none caused a playtest GM to raise their eyebrows quite like the superstition totem's Spell Sunder, which really saved us when we faced <i>walls of force</i>, magical trap effects, and more.</p>

<p>To close off, some of you might have expected me to talk about the dragon totem barbarian Linda is playing in my playtest game, who has sometimes been the party's primary healer. She does that through abilities beyond the barbarian class, though certainly Moment of Clarity (which allows a barbarian to use an extra action to use a concentrate ability mid-rage). But if you're wondering why there was a time in my playtest when she was the only one with an area attack, that was because of her barbarian's dragon breath!</p>

  <h1>Feats of Skill</h1>
  <p class="date"><time datetime="2018-06-08T19:00:00Z">Jun 8, 2018, 12:00 pm</time></p>
  <p itemprop="description">Now that Stephen has explained Pathfinder Second Edition's skills and how they work, it's time to look at the goodies you can earn as you level up: skill feats! Every character gets at least 10 skill feats, one at every even-numbered level, though rogues get 20, and you can always take a skill feat instead of a general feat. At their most basic level, skill feats allow you to customize how you use skills in the game, from combat tricks to social exploits, from risk-averse failure prevention to high-risk heroism. If you'd ever rather just have more trained skills than special techniques with the skills you already have, you can always take the Skill Training skill feat to do just that. Otherwise, you're in for a ride full of options, depending on your proficiency rank.</p>

<p class="date">Friday, June 08, 2018</p>

<div itemprop="articleBody">
 <div class="blurbCenter" style="display: none;"><a href="/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20180409-Card.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20180409-Card_360.jpeg"></a></div>

<p itemprop="description">Now that Stephen has explained Pathfinder Second Edition's skills and how they work, it's time to look at the goodies you can earn as you level up: skill feats! Every character gets at least 10 skill feats, one at every even-numbered level, though rogues get 20, and you can always take a skill feat instead of a general feat. At their most basic level, skill feats allow you to customize how you use skills in the game, from combat tricks to social exploits, from risk-averse failure prevention to high-risk heroism. If you'd ever rather just have more trained skills than special techniques with the skills you already have, you can always take the Skill Training skill feat to do just that. Otherwise, you're in for a ride full of options, depending on your proficiency rank.</p>

<h2>Assurance and Other Shared Feats</h2>
<p>Some skill feats are shared across multiple skills. One that will stand out to risk-averse players is Assurance, which allows you to achieve a result of 10, 15, 20, or even 30, depending on your proficiency rank, without rolling. Are you taking a huge penalty or being forced to roll multiple times and use the lowest result? Doesn't matter&mdash;with Assurance, you always get the listed result. It's perfect for when you want to be able to automatically succeed at certain tasks, and the kinds of things you can achieve with an automatic 30 are pretty significant, worthy of legendary proficiency.</p>

<p>The other shared skill feats tend to be shared between Arcana, Nature, Occultism, Religion, and sometimes Society and Lore. This is because many of them are based on magic, like Trick Magic Item (allowing you to use an item not meant for you, like a fighter using a wand) and Quick Identification, which lets you identify magic items faster depending on your proficiency rank, eventually requiring only 3 rounds of glancing at an item. The rest of the shared skill feats are based on the Recall Knowledge action, including my favorite, Dubious Knowledge, which gives you information even on a failed check&mdash;except some of it is accurate, and some of it is wrong!</p>

<h2>Scaling Feats</h2>
<p>You might have noticed that Assurance scales based on your proficiency rank in the skill. In fact, many skill feats do, granting truly outstanding results at legendary. For instance, let's look at the Cat Fall skill feat of Acrobatics:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class = "stat-block-title">CAT FALL <span class = "stat-block-cr">FEAT 1</span></p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Prerequisites</b> trained in Acrobatics</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">Your catlike aerial acrobatics allow you to cushion your fall. Treat all falls as if you fell 10 fewer feet. If you're an expert in Acrobatics, treat falls as 25 feet shorter. If you're a master in Acrobatics, treat them as 50 feet shorter. If you're legendary in Acrobatics, you always land on your feet and don't take damage, regardless of the distance of the fall.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>As you can see above, Cat Fall lets you treat all falls as 10 feet shorter, 25 feet shorter if you're an expert, or 50 feet shorter if you're a master. If you're legendary? Yeah, you can fall an unlimited distance and land on your feet, taking no damage. Similarly, a legendary performer can fascinate an unlimited number of people with a Fascinating Performance, scaling up from one person at the start. And these are just a few of the scaling skill feats.</p>

<h2>Wondrous Crafters</h2>
<p>Want to make a magic item? Great, take Magical Crafting and you can make any magic item&mdash;doesn't matter which kind.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class = "stat-block-title">MAGICAL CRAFTING <span class = "stat-block-cr">FEAT 2</span></p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Prerequisites</b> expert in Crafting</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">You can use the Craft activity to create magic items in addition to mundane ones. Many magic items have special crafting requirements, such as access to certain spells, as listed in the item entry in Chapter 11.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Similarly, there's a skill feat to make alchemical items, and even one to create quick-to-build improvised traps called snares!</p>

<h2>Legendary!</h2>
<p>Legendary characters can do all sorts of impressive things with their skills, not just using scaling skill feats but also using inherently legendary skill feats. If you're legendary, you can swim like a fish, survive indefinitely in the void of space, steal a suit of full plate off a guard (see Legendary Thief below), constantly sneak everywhere at full speed while performing other tasks (Legendary Sneak, from <a href="/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkts?Learning-Takes-a-Lifetime">Monday's blog</a>), give a speech that stops a war in the middle of the battlefield, remove an affliction or permanent condition with a medical miracle (Legendary Medic, also from <a href="/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkts?Learning-Takes-a-Lifetime">Monday's blog</a>), speak to any creature with a language instantly through an instinctual pidgin language, completely change your appearance and costume in seconds (see Legendary Impersonator below), squeeze through a hole the size of your head at your full walking speed, decipher codes with only a skim, and more!</p>

<blockquote>

<p class = "stat-block-title">[[A]][[A]][[A]]LEGENDARY IMPERSONATOR  <span class = "stat-block-cr">FEAT 15</span></p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Prerequisites</b> legendary in Deception, Quick Disguise</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">You set up a full disguise with which you can Impersonate someone with incredible speed.</p>

<p class = "stat-block-title">LEGENDARY THIEF  <span class = "stat-block-cr">FEAT 15</span></p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Prerequisites</b> legendary in Thievery, Pickpocket</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">Your ability to steal items defies belief. You can attempt to Steal an Object that is actively wielded or that would be extremely noticeable or time-consuming to remove (like worn shoes or armor). You must do so slowly and carefully, spending at least 1 minute and significantly longer for items that are normally time-consuming to remove (like armor). Throughout this duration you must have some means of staying hidden, whether under cover of darkness or in a bustling crowd, for example. You take a -5 penalty to your Thievery check. Even if you succeed, if the item is extremely prominent, like a suit of full plate armor, onlookers will quickly notice it's gone after you steal it.</p>

<p>So what sorts of feats are you most excited to perform with your skills? Let me know in the comments section!</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline">Core Principles: Designing the Next Pathfinder ACG</h1>

<div itemprop="articlebody">

<p class="date">Thursday, June 7, 2018</p>

<div class="blurb180" style="display:none;"><a href="/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180329-Preview2.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180329-Preview2_180.jpeg"></a></div>

<p itemprop = "description">Last Friday, our team turned over to project lead Vic Wertz the first draft of the upcoming <i>Pathfinder Adventure Card Game Core Set</i>. This is a new type of box set, about which I'll go into detail below and in later articles in this series, which will run for the next year. Sometimes I'll write it, and sometimes you'll see the musings of the other members of our highly talented design team.</p>

<p>It is not coincidental that this turnover came at the end of a highly eventful week for the Pathfinder ACG design team. As we began shipping our upcoming games <i>The Ninth World</i> and <a href="http://lonesharkgames.com/games/thornwatch/" target="_blank"><i>Thornwatch</i></a>, the Lone Shark designers took the so-called "final" version (SPOILER: it wasn't) of the Core Set to <a href="/paizocon">PaizoCon</a>, our favorite convention to run PACG at. At Saturday night's Preview Banquet, I revealed the not-at-all-surprising fact that we were making a new Core Set, as well the slightly bigger surprise that the next Adventure Path is based on the beloved <a href="/products/btpy9nme">Curse of the Crimson Throne</a>.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter">
<a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180607-CorePaizoCon.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180607-CorePaizoCon_360.jpeg"></a>
<br /><i>Showtime.</i></p></div>

<p>The Core Set can be played by itself, if that's all you want&mdash;its story content is based on the Pathfinder Module <a href="/products/btpy8yvy?Pathfinder-Module-The-Dragons-Demand"><i>The Dragon's Demand</i></a>&mdash;and we're increasing the replayability even over previous sets. But when you combine it with Curse, you'll have something about the same size as previous Adventure Paths. Importantly, you need Core for Curse, because the latter needs the former as a foundation to function. That's true for <i>every</i> adventure we want to make going forward. So when we produce another Adventure Path, or even perhaps a smaller adventure, you'll combine it with the Core Set and get an experience similar to Rise of the Runelords or Mummy's Mask. I described at the banquet how Core was basically done in design, and Curse was well underway.</p>

<p>I described how both would release just before PaizoCon 2019, which made a lot of people there very happy. Me, for example.</p>

<p>And then I went into why we were making it now, and really what we were and weren't making. Some of it supplemented <a href="/community/blog/v5748dyo5ljus">this blog</a>, but since it's a year later, I actually knew what I was talking about this time. So now I'll tell you.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter">
<a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180607-SharkWall.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180607-SharkWall_360.jpeg"></a>
<br /><i>I would like to officially note that we are fully capable of making a Top 5 list that stops at five.</i></p></div>

<p>This graphic has been on our design team's whiteboard for several months. Its goal is to remind us what we're doing and why.</p>

<h2>What's Staying the Same</h2>
<p>The most important element of this project is perhaps the least obvious: We want to keep making the game we've been making. Throughout my career, I've helped lead many reboots and expansions&mdash;D&amp;D 3rd Edition, Axis &amp; Allies, Attack!, and Betrayal at House on the Hill, to name a few. Each time I've started by spelling out how much we wanted to move the goalposts. That has typically defined whether we're making a new <i>set</i> or a new <i>edition</i>.</p>

<p>As I've said for a while, we're not making this a "second edition." Our goal isn't to invalidate anything you have currently; everything you own for PACG is still good and will continue to be. What we are creating now will interlock nicely with Skull &amp; Shackles, Wrath of the Righteous, Class Decks, and everything else that has come before. Some things are changing around the edges, including some important terminology. but as we saw in our PaizoCon playtests, people got those changes within minutes and were off playing without hesitation.</p>

<p>At the heart, the PACG experience involves five cornerstone principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improving your character by acquiring better boons for your deck.</li>
<li>Increasing your character's power along a linear arc, corresponding to an increase in the difficulty of challenges.</li>
<li>Giving you a variety of ways to grow your character over time and make it your own.</li>
<li>Letting you explore the world by encountering cards and dealing with their challenges.</li>
<li>Doing so as a part of a cooperative team in an involving story.</li>
</ul>
<p>None of this is going to change. We're not adding a PvP option, dynamiting your role cards, or flattening out the power curve. These cornerstone principles had to be observed when considering any change we wanted to make. Fortunately, a whole lot of changes still fit under that tent.</p>

<h2>What's Changing</h2>
<p>Over the last five years, we've heard a lot of the same complaints. (We've especially heard them from inside our office.) We figured we could use that experience to spruce up PACG to be a better, faster, smarter game. We looked hard at these challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>The game is <b>a bit too slow</b> in all phases: how long it took to set up, how long it took to take a turn, how long it took to tear down. We looked for solutions that sped up everything, even if we gained just a few seconds here or there.</li>
<li>For a game set in one of the most expansive fantasy worlds ever made, we gave you <b>too little story</b>. The opportunity we had to tell stories was mostly limited to tiny boxes on the backs of cards, and conveyed very little of the depth the orignal storytellers had given us.</li>
<li>Though we tell many different stories, the game often gives off a <b>feeling of sameness</b>. We did morph from only having a few different scenario types in Rise of the Runelords to having only a few "standard" scenarios in Mummy's Mask. But more can be done.</li>
<li>Groups of players get <b>varying experiences by group size</b>. A solo character is less likely to run out of time and more likely to die; the reverse is true for large groups. While that's fine, giving people the ability to toggle those variables seemed smart.</li>
<li>Many cards have <b>complicated text</b>. We've piled template upon template, sometimes requiring three or four powers on a card <i>before</i> we started making it interesting. Certain card types like armors and spells got burdened in ways we never envisioned.</li>
<li>Some sets were easy and some were hard, but regardless there was <b>no way to control difficulty</b>. If you wanted to make the game harder, you were on your own. We will benefit from giving players controls for this.</li>
<li>For a cooperative card game, the game is often <b>not interactive enough</b>. When you want to help your friend, the game generally tells you that you can't unless you have a card that does so. It's a co-op game, so it should feel more cooperative.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to a design team that has grown and learned from all our iterations of the game, we had three other resources to use to achieve some of these goals. None of them existed when we made Rise of the Runelords, but all had been successful in its wake. The first was the <a href="/pathfindersociety/acg">Pathfinder Society Adventure Card Guild</a>, which showed us new ways to tell and organize stories. The second was Obsidian's <a href="https://pathfinder.obsidian.net">Pathfinder Adventures</a> app, which showed us ways to make the game sleeker and faster. The third was Lone Shark's second ACG, <a href="/products/btpy9sct">Apocrypha</a>, in which we addressed a lot of these concerns.</p>

<p>In the next installment of this design diary, I'll talk about how we used those tools to address one of those big challenges: injecting more story. Thanks for reading!</p>

<p itemprop="description">When we got back from PaizoCon, I asked the team to write blurbs about the highlights of PaizoCon. Unfortunately, Linda failed her will save and wasn't in the office when I asked, so we will have to include her perspective in a different blog.

No matter how many long hours go into planning and preparing for a convention, seeing attendee's enjoyment makes it all worthwhile. But my collegues are more eloquent in their summaries, so I turn the blog over to them.</p>

<p>This was my seventh PaizoCon and sixth as an employee (goodness), filled with all sorts of great moments. Friday morning opened with the traditional round of Golarionender, a Pathfinder-inspired reimagination of Mythender RPG. The PCs successfully Ended Aroden, but in the process a new deity of avarice rose from the smoldering ashes of the Isle of Kortos. We counted it as a win!</p>

<p>We also debuted a series of four Pathfinder Playtest quests called The Rose Street Revenge. I ran one set of it, and several of my colleagues ran their own renditions over the course of the weekend. The story ran pretty smoothly, and I look forward to having it as a demo starting at Origins 2018 and beyond. My players for both this and the PaizoCon delve were lovely, including one player (a familiar face and recent freelancer) who took it well when I had to end one delve a little early in order to make it to a panel&mdash;in the process clobbering his character Seelah and then continuing to attack the collapsed PC to "show off how the dying rules work."</p>

<p>Trivia went beautifully, even with the heckling of a growing table of Paizo employees, freelancers, and honored observers who survived the ballroom bar's extraordinarily potent tequila-soaked pineapples. The winners were Tonya's Tots (briefly Tonya's Orphans when she had to leave and then later Tonya's Champions). You can find Painlord's transcription of the trivia questions on the <a href="/threads/rzs2v5t3&amp;page=4?2018-PFS-PaizoCon-Bloggery-with-Pathfinder#154">PFS Bloggery</a> thread.</p>

<p>On Sunday night I gathered a group of Utter Jackals for <a href="/products/btpy9y4i?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-899C-The-Solstice-Scar-Version-C"><i>Pathfinder Society Special #8-99C: The Solstice Scar</i></a>, which went pretty smoothly. Although we had lost a few members of our team from last year, we easily recruited a few more to give our GM Andrew Geels a bit of a scare. We may not have completed a lot of encounters, but our primary goals&mdash;sassing each other, howling like maenads, and not getting kicked out by Tonya&mdash;were a success. I learned from some of the Tier 10-11 tables that there's one encounter in particular that needs some tweaking, so keep an eye out on the product page for an update.</p>

<p>My best experience all weekend, though, was easily the pick-up game of <a href="/products/btpy9x0x?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-109-Live-Exploration-Extreme"><i>Starfinder Society Scenario #1-09: Live Exploration Extreme!</i></a> that I ran on Friday night. Normally PaizoCon's Friday evening is my opportunity to play at a random table, but I learned in the afternoon that the slot was sold out but might have an unused table. Figuring my only way to be in a game would be to run one, I pulled together a few folks as players (Lyz Liddell, Thurston Hillman, and Jenny Jarzabski) and then left the other three slots open to accommodate walk-ups. We got three buddies wanting to play together (Jeff, Brad, and Paul), and none of them had ever played Starfinder Society before. It turned out beautifully with five of the table playing 4th-level Obozaya (a large set of siblings) and the other playing 4th-level "O-bo-Raia." Our newcomers jumped into the game and the weird party composition almost immediately, and the Raia player was an absolute saint in putting up with the vesks' shenanigans. Apparently we were audible across the busy ballroom every time we put out hands in the middle of the table and shouted "O-BO-ZAYA!" as if hyping ourselves before a sports match.</p>

<p>I'm partway through a lengthy summary for the <a href="/threads/rzs2v5t3?2018-PFS-PaizoCon-Bloggery-with-Pathfinder">2018 PFS PaizoCon Bloggery</a> thread, where you'll be able to find many of the frightful details. Again, heartfelt kudos to those three strangers who helped make the game so amazing.</p>

<p>Despite the conventions' best attempts to take him out, Michael managed to overcome all adversity and emerge from the experience victorious:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This was my first PaizoCon as an employee and oh my goodness, what an adventure! Several adventures, really. I got to meet PFS officers and agents from around the country and beyond Thursday night to kick off the convention. Friday was an opportunity to stuff swag bags for the attendees, run and assist with the Pathfinder Playtest delve, and join the master of monsters Adam Daigle and special guest Taylor Fischer for a Concepting Monsters panel, and that evening I ran my lottery game, Broken Lattice, for an amazing group of players who slew vrocks, rode half-celestial unicorns, and slew a qlippoth in its home on a magma-ridden level of the Abyss. Saturday was fairly similar, but I had more opportunities to hang out in the PFS room and chat with some of the players who had traveled from all over to be there, which was fantastic. Unfortunately, I was struck down with some as-yet-undiagnosed-but-probably-food-related illness that left me out of commission for most of Sunday, but I did manage to climb my way to the Cascade rooms for my second and final lottery game. Despite my being under the weather, everyone was game to tackle the adventure and I once more had an excellent time taking some fantastic players on a tour of the planar causeways.</p>

<p>To sum up, I had an amazing time, ran a delve, participated on a panel, played games with awesome people from around the world, and was then devastated by wracking illness. I'm told that this means I had a pretty standard PaizoCon, so hopefully I'll get to do <i>most</i> of this again next year!</p>

<h2>Campaign Coin</h2>
<p>Traveling around the world allows me to meet and interact with lots of our players and volunteers. It also means I hear lots of stories about fantastic members of our community who give of their time and labors to plan organized play activities in their areas. It is my pleasure to recognize some of these society stalwarts! The first three were given at PaizoCon the last weekend of May. I announced the other two at UK Games Expo, but we are withholding their names until their RVCs can deliver the coins and make the announcements. Once that is done, I will reveal them here.</p>

</tbody></table>

<p>If you know a deserving member of your community, please email me at <a href="mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com">organizedplay@paizo.com</a> with their name, location, and the reasons you feel they should be recognized for their service. If you are able, please include what events they may attend in 2018. This is especially helpful if they will be at an event with a member of the organized play team (see further down the blog for that list of events.)</p>

<h2>Stars and Novas</h2>
<p>With convention season underway, the opportunities for GMing abound and the ranks of 5-star GMs grows. Huge congratulations to all those that achieved their fifth star over the past month!</p>
<p>To achieve this milestone, GMs facilitate 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 are special scenarios, as well as run a game for a venture-captain. A conservative estimate of time needed to reach 5-stars is 650 hours! To the GM listed below, thank you very much for the time and energy you spend running Pathfinder Society games! Your efforts are greatly appreciated.</p>

<h2>Volunteer Opportunities</h2>
<p>We still have badges and rooms available for Gen Con volunteers. If you are interested in volunteering to run Pathifner Socity or Starfinder Society events, please visit the <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/pxUyPSyeIK9dfwbl2" target="_blank"><u>Gen Con 2018 volunteer questionnaire</u></a> for more information and to register.</p>

<h2>Gen Con Event Update</h2>
<p>I submitted the last of the games and all the seminars for Gen Con and they should post soon. We also pulled the ticket sales data and I'm working with Bob Jonquet to figure out if we can add more tables to any of the events. If you tried to get into a game and found it sold out, please check back next week to see if more seats are available.</p>

<h2>Conventions</h2>
<p>Want to attend a convention this summer? Check out the list below! I've updated the list with all the event support requests I've received to date. If you see one missing, ping the organizer and have them submit a request for support or email me at <a href="mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com">organizedplay@paizo.com</a> to discuss their event. All of the conventions on the list maintain some type of web presence, be it website, social media page, or Warhorn listing, so if you are interested in attending in either capacity, check out their websites or contact the local venture-officer for more information!</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline">Todd's Top Five</h1>
 
<p class="date">Tuesday, June 5, 2018</p>

<div itemprop = "articlebody">

<div class="blurbCenter" style="display:none;"><a href="/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20180605-Preview.jpg"><img src="/image/content/Pathfinderrpg/20180605-Preview_500.jpeg"></a></div>

<p itemprop="description">I'm Todd Stewart, that freelancer who habitually begs for planar content, aka that protean and daemon person who neither admits nor denies to actually being a glamorous neutral evil fiend.</p>

<p>A decade ago Paizo had me write <a href="/products/btpy87uz?Pathfinder-Chronicles-The-Great-Beyond-A-Guide-to-the-Multiverse"><em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: The Great Beyond</em></a> exploring Pathfinder's cosmology and fleshing out its outsiders as something unique as it branched off as its own game. Since then, the cosmology has evolved and expanded, with such really cool additions as psychopomps, divs, and sakhils, the <em>Book of the Damned</em> series, and other resources.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20180605-Maelstrom.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20180605-Maelstrom_500.jpeg"></a>
<br /><i>Illustration by Marius Bota</i></p></div>

<p>For most of the past decade I've pleaded to see a planar hardcover for Pathfinder, and the begging finally paid off! As one of <a href="/products/btpya1am?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Planar-Adventures"><em>Pathfinder RPG Planar Adventures</em></a>' freelancers I can't wait to see it released for you folks who've been asking for this for just as long as I have. So what do you have to look forward to? Here's a list of some of my favorite things in Planar Adventures:</p>

<div class = "blurb360"><a href = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20180605-IlsetsyaWyrmtouched.jpg"><img src = "//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20180605-IlsetsyaWyrmtouched_360.jpeg"></a>
<p><i>Illustration by Gabriela Marchioro</i></p></div>

<ol>
<li>The original <i>Great Beyond</i> was a solo project for me, but Planar Adventures let me collaborate with some seriously talented folks and get their awesome ideas into play. For me, it's like jumping out of bed, running downstairs, and feverishly opening up Christmas gifts, beyond excited at what you might find and having it all be a wonderful surprise.</li>
<li>Galisemni, the City of the Celestial and the Damned, originally showed up as only a name on the map of the Maelstrom, but for years it was the primary setting of my home Pathfinder campaign, and I'm incredibly excited to finally detail it. May the Watching Seven grant you favor, may the Lethe Wall not covet your name unless fate holds that in store, and whatever you do, don't get into a drinking contest with Il'setsya Wyrmtouched (ganzi arcanist, itinerant drunkard, pesh-connoisseur, and my PC when I played in Rise of the Runelords). This is my favorite location that I've ever created in any RPG supplement ever, and I'm proud to add it into the game and see what you folks do with it!</li>
<li>Shadow Absalom was another planar city originally from <i>The Great Beyond</i> and it and the Shadow Plane get additional detail herein. What plots does the great wyrm Argrinyxia, the Shifting Lady of Ebon Scales, spin? What mysteries lurk within the gloom for your PCs to find? Do you dare explore a landscape twisted by Zon-Kuthon's own dreams and nightmares?</li>
<li>The Negative Energy Plane is one of the most criminally underused planes, but here it shines, darkly so. Avoid the plane's native sceaduinar, the so-called raptors of the void, and take shelter from the Void's horrific natural hazards from the macabre (relative) safety of Malikar's Keep. Plumb the hungry, lightless depths for such legendary locations as Fallen Duromak, a Material planet swallowed and lost, or the enigmatic, manifest horror of Eternity's Doorstep that hideously feeds upon the undead. <em>Planar Adventures</em> provides reasons to visit each plane, flavor to inspire, and a myriad of locations to send PCs.</li>
<li>Really cool NPCs: Ssila'meshnik the Colorless Lord (protean lord of fate, freedom, and paradox); a deific information for The Speakers of the Depths; Inusalia the meladaemon alchemist and her cross-planar pesh emporium who harvests the souls of repeat clients to sate her own addiction; Jacarkas the Collector, harbinger thrall of Trelmarixian and lord of Abaddon's slave city of Awaiting-Consumption; and many more!</li>
</ol>

<p>This book was a joy and a privilege to work on and soon it will be in your hands! Enjoy, have fun, and don't blame me if proteans eat your PCs.</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline">Learning Takes a Lifetime</h1>
<p class="date">Monday, June 04, 2018</p>

<div itemprop="articleBody">

<div class="blurbCenter" style="display: none;"><a href="/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20180406-Preview.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20180406-Preview_360.jpeg"></a></div>

<p itemprop="description">While the kind of armor you wear, weapon you wield, and spells you know can be important measures of your character's power, your choice in skills is indicative of your character's depth. Is your character good at feats of acrobatics? Can they recall knowledge with scholastic effortlessness? Are they the sneakiest sneaker in the sneakerverse? Your skills may aid you in the thick of a fight, but they also enhance your effect on the world when the ringing of steel and the whizzing of spells subside.</p>

<p>The Pathfinder Playtest deals with skills a bit differently than the first edition did. First and foremost, we have cut down the skill list to 17 base skills (down from 35 base skills in Pathfinder First Edition). Now, I say "base skills" because the Lore skill can be split into numerous different lores, but for many purposes, like for this blog post, we can describe it as being a single skill.</p>

<p>Much of the reduction came from consolidation; for instance, we put the general functions of Use Magic Device into each of the various knowledge skills that focus on magical traditions, and we wrapped up a bunch of Strength-based skills into a general Athletics skill. In most cases, we coupled the consolidation with being a tad more generous in the number of skills you can be trained in (for instance, the fighter has 3 + Intelligence modifier trained skills in the playtest rather than 2 + Int in Pathfinder First Edition), making it easier to have a well-rounded character.</p>

<p>So what exactly are these 17 skills? They (and their key ability scores) are: Acrobatics (Dex), Arcana (Int), Athletics (Str), Crafting (Int), Deception (Cha), Diplomacy (Cha), Intimidation (Cha), Lore (Int), Medicine (Wis), Nature (Wis), Occultism (Int), Performance (Cha), Religion (Wis), Society (Int), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Thievery (Dex).</p>

<h2>Skill Proficiency</h2>
<p>Like many things in the Pathfinder Playtest, skills interact with the proficiency system. While a detailed description of the system can be <a href="/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkm3?Are-You-Proficient">found here</a>, here's the nitty-gritty. Your character can be untrained, trained, an expert, a master, or legendary in a skill. Being untrained grants you a modifier of your level - 2, while being trained grants you a bonus equal to your level, expert a bonus equal to your level + 1, master a bonus equal to your level + 2, and legendary a bonus equal to your level + 3. Then, of course, you add your ability modifier in the key ability for that skill, and apply any other bonuses or penalties. But the new skill system is more than just the bonus you gain. Each level of proficiency unlocks skill uses that are either intrinsic to the skill itself or that are uses you select as your character advances.</p>

<h2>Skill Uses</h2>
<p>To give you an idea of what this means, let's take a quick look at the Medicine skill. Whether you are trained in Medicine or not, you can Administer First Aid.</p>


<blockquote>

<p class = "stat-block-title">[[A]] Administer First Aid</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Manipulate</b></p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Requirements</b> You must have healer's tools.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">You perform first aid on an adjacent creature that is at 0 Hit Points in an attempt to stabilize or revive it. You can also perform first aid on an adjacent creature taking persistent bleed damage. The DC for either is 15. If a creature is both dying and bleeding, choose which one you're trying to end before you roll. You can Administer First Aid again to attempt to remedy the other.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-2"><b>Success</b> The creature at 0 Hit Points gains 1 Hit Point, or you end the persistent bleed damage.</p>
<p class = "stat-block-2"><b>Critical Failure</b> A creature with 0 Hit Points has its dying condition increased by 1. A creature with persistent bleed damage takes damage equal to the amount of its persistent bleed damage.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Basically, this skill use allows anyone who has a healing kit to treat another creature who is dying or suffering from bleed damage, which is super useful. Of course, being untrained reduces your chances to save your friend and increases your chances to hurt them accidentally, but it's worth trying in a pinch. If you are trained in the skill, not only do your chances to help a friend by Administering First Aid increase, but you also gain the ability to use the skill to Treat Disease and Treat Poison, something that someone untrained in the skill cannot do.</p>

<h2>Skill Feats</h2>
<p>These default uses are just the beginning. As you increase in level, you periodically gain skill feats, usually at even-numbered levels (unless you're a rogue&mdash;they gain skill feats every level instead). Skill feats are a subsection of general feats, which means that any character can take them as long as they meet the prerequisites. Moving forward with the example of the Medicine skill, as long as you are at least trained in Medicine, you can take the Battle Medic skill feat. This feat allows you to apply straight-up healing to an ally through nonmagical means, which is nice when your cleric is knocked to the ground or has run out of uses of channel energy.</p>

<p>For a higher-level example, Robust Recovery is a Medicine skill feat you can take after becoming an expert in that skill, and increases the bonus to saving throws against poison and diseases when you treat creatures with those trained skill uses. When you become legendary in Medicine, you can gain this skill feat:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class = "stat-block-title">Legendary Medic <span class = "stat-block-cr">Feat 15</span></p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>General, Skill</b></p>
<p class = "stat-block-1"><b>Prerequisites</b> legendary in Medicine</p>
<p class = "stat-block-1">You've invented new medical procedures or discovered ancient techniques that can achieve nearly miraculous results. Once per day for each target, you can spend 1 hour treating the target and attempt a Medicine check to remove a disease or the blinded, deafened, drained, or enervated condition. Use the DC of the disease or of the spell or effect that created the condition. If the effect's source is an artifact, a creature above 20th level, or other similarly powerful source, increase the DC by 5.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The more powerful or useful the skill feat, the higher the proficiency required to take it. Legendary Medic grants you the ability to perform amazing feats of healing through skill and experience rather than magic, but you must gain that skill and experience first. Of course, the Medicine skill is just the tip of the iceberg. This structure is replicated with every skill, including nearly every rogue's favorite&mdash;Stealth.</p>

<p>Stealth is a bit of an outlier in that all of its initial uses can be attempted untrained, but training and later proficiency in the skill yields some very subversive results. The Quiet Allies skill feat allows you to use your expertise in Stealth to reduce those pesky armor check penalties on allies' skill checks, while Swift Sneak allows a master in Stealth to move at their full speed when they Sneak. Upon becoming legendary, you further enhance your skill by no longer needing to specifically declare the sneaking exploration tactic when you are in exploration mode, allowing you to sneak everywhere. You're just that good.</p>

<p>But this is all just the start. Mark will take up more aspects of what you can do with skill feats this Friday!</p>

<h2>Constant Progress</h2>
<p>Like many aspects of the Pathfinder Playtest, the goal of skills is not only to gain the greatest bonus, but also for you to expand outward and create a unique character who uses skills the way you want them to be used. Much like how ancestry feats allow you to choose the type of human, dwarf, elf, or whatever you want to play, the proficiency and skill feat system will enable you to determine what kind of knowledgeable, athletic, or sneaky character you want to play. Over time, this system gives us the opportunity to add more skill uses by way of skill feats, which will allow the game to become more dynamic as we add options. This also allows you to continue to grow your skills in new and surprising ways without us having to pull out the wires of the underlying skill, which is something we are always loath to do. In this way, as the game progresses, we can expand skill options in an open-ended way, without invalidating the gateway mechanics.</p>

<p itemprop="description">Hey, everybody! It's our first design blog after PaizoCon! It was great getting a chance to show the game off for the attendees there and collect your comments after your first chance to play. But what if we looked at something there wasn't a chance to demo at the convention?</p>

<p>We've mentioned before that we're more clearly defining the three modes of play for the Pathfinder Playtest. Encounter, exploration, and downtime mode all have a place in the game, and they each play out differently at the table. So, let's look at the robust new systems we've built to cover what your characters do when they're not out on adventures!</p>

<p>Downtime mode is measured in days and gives you a chance to enact your long-term plans. You might craft items, heal up, conduct rituals, retrain some of your character options to choose other ones, or work at jobs or stage performances to make money. These are all things that take time and can't really be done in the middle of a dungeon.</p>

<p>Of course, just like with the other modes of play, these are all things you could do previously in Pathfinder. The difference in the Playtest is that we've more clearly defined these tasks in terms of what you can complete in the number of days you commit to them. This means if the GM wants to codify how long things take, it's more obvious what the value of a day spent at a task is.</p>

<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>When you have a day or more off, you can choose a defined downtime activity (or decide to do whatever else you want to). A few of these are general, like taking bed rest to heal more quickly or retraining your feats, skill choices, and selectable class features. </p>

<p>Most of downtime activities, however, appear under skills and require skill checks. The ones appearing in the <i>Pathfinder Playtest Rulebook</i> are Craft, Create Forgery, Gather Information, Practice a Trade, Stage a Performance, Subsist on the Streets, Survive in the Wild, and Treat Disease. All of these require a skill check to determine how successful you are, and a few are explained in more detail later in this blog.</p>

<p>We also know we'll have some downtime activities that are beyond the scope of the systems in the <i>Playtest Rulebook</i>. Building a keep or wizard's tower is one of the big ones. While we for sure want you to be able to establish a home base, this requires interconnectedness between other systems and a high level of work by the GM, so for the Playtest, we wanted to keep the focus on the more directly player-oriented downtime activities.</p>

<h2>Making Money</h2>
<p>Practicing a Trade and Staging a Performance use Lore skills or the Performance skill, respectively, to make money and potentially draw the attention of employers or patrons. For these activities, the GM determines what type of work or audience you can find and assigns it a level, using the same scale as PC levels. This sets your DC and how much money you can make, with more money coming in based on your proficiency rank. If you're in a small town and you're higher level, you might not find the type of sophisticated work that makes full use of your talents. If you're adventuring in the Shackles, maybe you can find work as a master of Sailing Lore that you wouldn't be able to find in, say, the Hold of Belkzen.</p>

<p>Because downtime can include a really large number of days, performing these activities long-term requires rolls only for interesting events; you can continue doing the job and earning money at a steady rate until the job is completed or your audiences run out. This means you can cover long periods of downtime quickly and embellish your activity with interesting details, rather than getting bogged down with 30 rolls for a month of downtime.</p>

<h2>Crafting</h2>
<p>One of the parts of downtime we know will be important to people is crafting items, including magical and alchemical ones. We knew that we didn't want item crafting to be as powerful in the new edition as it was in the first edition, where it was simply too easy to end up with far more powerful characters that had twice as much wealth, and in a way that didn't make a whole lot of sense in the game world.</p>

<p>In the Playtest, items have levels. You can craft items of your level or lower, and you must be skilled enough at crafting, reflected in your proficiency rank, to craft an item of that quality (trained for standard items, and expert, master, or legendary for higher-quality ones). Crafting an item requires you to spend half its Price in crafting materials. You might find or acquire these sorts of materials, and most of them you can buy directly with currency, if you need to.</p>

<p>You have to spend at least 4 days crafting an item of your level, and you can reduce this if your level is higher than the item's. Once that time is up, you have two options if you succeed at your check: complete the item right away by supplying the rest of its Price in materials (a great option if you have the money for the item but can't find one on the market), or spend more time on your crafting to reduce the Price through your superior skill. You can stop crafting at any time and complete the item by providing the remaining amount of its Price. If you got a critical success on your skill check, the discount is better!</p>

<p>What does this mean for characters who are looking to make money by crafting? Well, crafting progress is based on a similar scale to Practicing a Trade or Staging a Performance, so it's about as lucrative. In fact, if you want to work as a crafter for cash instead of items, you can use the same rules for Practice a Trade, but using your Crafting skill modifier instead! You might make most of your money crafting and selling minor items in a process taken from the normal rules, but you might also get the occasional special commission from a client who wants a specific item and is willing to pay top... gold piece.</p>

<h2>Using Downtime in Your Game</h2>
<p>If you're a Game Master, downtime lets you pace out your game and show the passage of time between adventures. Characters and their circumstances can change in tangible ways during their downtime. Adding color and storylines to downtime, as well as recurring characters, helps the PCs form bonds and feel they're more a part of the world around them. It also means that PCs with long-term goals have a clear way of attaining them, with a clearer structure than the game had before. Less guesswork for you, and immense expandability!</p>

<p>So how are your characters going to spend their downtime?</p>
