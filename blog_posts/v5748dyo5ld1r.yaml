  \ Kevin Andrew Murphy</p> \n    <h2>Chapter One: The Flowers of Calistria</h2> \n\
  \    <p>They say the wickedest thing about the old nobles was that they were always\
  \ coming back from the dead, 'cause folk never came back quite right.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>They don't know the half of it.</p> \n    <p>I swore.</p> \n    <p>\"None of\
  \ that, Orlin,\" my brother corrected. \"We're in Isarn now. Remember your manners.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"But Norret!\" I pointed. \"Look! She's at it again!\"</p> \n   \
  \ <p>Indeed she was. One of the little bouquets from my tray had floated in the\
  \ air, high over the crowd waiting for the executions, and up to one of the windows\
  \ of the House of Joy.</p> \n    <p>That's what they call the temple of Calistria\
  \ in Isarn. Back in Dabril, Calistria's temple was just the beekeeper's house, and\
  \ no one besides him did much in the way of worship. In Isarn it was one of the\
  \ old palaces. But instead of nobles, each window had a beautiful woman or a half-dressed\
  \ man.</p> \n    <p>Each also had a window box of carrots instead of flowers, since\
  \ the Revolutionary Council had recently declared that everyone, even the temple\
  \ of Calistria, had to grow vegetables, and use horse manure besides.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>It made the city stink even worse than usual. That's why we were selling nosegays.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Norret swore too, an expression I'd never heard before. I guessed he'd\
  \ picked it up soldiering. He followed it with a growl: \"Rhodel...\"</p> \n   \
  \ <p>That was the name of the old strumpet back in our town before I died. Before\
  \ she died, too, and went off to serve Dabril's patron goddess, Shelyn.</p> \n \
  \   <p>I should probably have mentioned the dying bit.</p> \n    <p>I died, I guess.\
  \ All I know is I had a fever and I had this dream. There was a beautiful lady who\
  \ wanted me to come with her, and a grave lady who said that I couldn't because\
  \ there was someone else coming for me. Then the beautiful lady made me a bed of\
  \ roses, told me to sleep, and I did.</p> \n    <p>I swear they were Shelyn and\
  \ Pharasma, the actual goddesses. I mean, who else could they be?</p> \n    <p>The\
  \ next thing I knew, I was being woken up by a pretty girl a little older than me,\
  \ maybe sixteen summers, and she definitely wasn't Shelyn or Pharasma. She said\
  \ she was Rhodel, and she looked sort of like the old Dabril prostitute, only young\
  \ and pretty. Rhodel told me she was a friend of my brother's, and I should come\
  \ because he was waiting for me.</p> \n    <p>So Rhodel took my hand, and next thing\
  \ I'm standing in the town graveyard, it's winter, and Norret's there, but he's\
  \ all grown up. Last I saw him, he was barely older than I am.</p> \n    <p>He used\
  \ to be fun, too, but now he's all learned and trained in alchemy, which is what\
  \ he used to bring me back. Of course my brother doesn't know everything, since\
  \ he didn't expect he'd get Rhodel in the bargain.</p> \n    <p>He spent what coin\
  \ we had to talk to some necromancers, and they told him stuff about \"psychopomps\"\
  \ and \"spirit guides.\" Even Norret was confused by all of it, which is saying\
  \ something. Me? All I know is that I came back from the dead and now I'm being\
  \ haunted by a dead harlot. </p> \n    <p>A dead harlot, I should add, who was currently\
  \ taking one of our boquets to a living one. Not that you're supposed to call the\
  \ priestesses of Calistria that, since they're \"sacred prostitutes,\" and when\
  \ they're not turning tricks or playing them, they're getting revenge, and they\
  \ ride around on wasps the size of ponies. This one was tarted up in a gown of yellow-and-black\
  \ oiled silk, and even had a fuzzy black-and-gold-striped muff to match. Except\
  \ that it wasn't. It took wing, and I realized the muff was a bumblebee the size\
  \ of a lapdog.</p> \n    <p>The bumblebee bumbled around the nosegay, caught it\
  \ with its claws, then brought it back to its mistress. She took a whiff, smiled,\
  \ then looked down from her balcony and gestured for Norret and me to come up.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The guards let us use the outside stair, and next thing the sacred dollymop\
  \ was rising from her divan. Excepting my dream-Shelyn, she was the most beautiful\
  \ woman I'd ever seen, with honey-blonde hair done up in patriotic Galtan braids\
  \ and three patches shaped like daggers rayed around her right eye. She was dressed\
  \ a lot sluttier, too.</p> \n    <p>\"What a delightful tussie-mussie.\" She smelled\
  \ the flowers again. \"These blossoms are mere tissue paper, but their scent is\
  \ fair enough to fool a bee.\" Hers sat on her shoulder, eyeing the bouquet with\
  \ eyes like perfume-bottle stoppers. \"How can this be?\"</p> \n    <p>I half expected\
  \ Norret to explain how he'd found the secrets of the perfumers' guild hidden in\
  \ the diary of the Duke of Dabril, and how we'd been using them to make fake flowers,\
  \ but all he said was, \"Ah, fair lady, the flowers are false but the scents are\
  \ true. Floral essences from the fields of Dabril...\"</p> \n    <p>She laughed\
  \ lightly. \"I've heard tell of the legendary artisans of some Mwangi queen, able\
  \ to craft false blossoms so lifelike that they fooled all but Calistria's bees.\
  \ You, it seems, have done them one better. But I wonder... can your false flowers\
  \ be used to encode a message like a true tussie-mussie?\" She looked at the bouquet,\
  \ inspecting the blossoms. \"Ah yes, here's honeysuckle, for ‘the bonds of love'...\
  \ And vervain—that's ‘sorcery,' yes?\" She looked at Norret and then at me. Rhodel\
  \ had picked up another of the nosegays, and it was floating. I reached out and\
  \ grabbed it back. \"Ah yes, definitely ‘sorcery.' Your assistant is far too young\
  \ to be a wizard, but definitely has the mage's hand.\"</p> \n    <p>She was wrong\
  \ on both counts, but not by much as I realized both of my actual hands were still\
  \ steadying the tray, while my spirit's hand was on the tussie-mussie and was playing\
  \ tug-of-war for it with Rhodel. It must have looked like two invisible bridesmaids\
  \ wrestling for the right to be the next one married.</p> \n    <p>Like I said,\
  \ people never come back from the dead quite right. The overpriced necromancers\
  \ told Norret stuff about spectral hands and phantom limbs. All I know is that my\
  \ soul isn't tied to my body as tightly as it should be and that's not good.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The Calistrian dollymop sniffed her bouquet. \"And lavender... That's\
  \ either ‘devotion' or ‘distrust'... I forget which. I'd have to check my floral\
  \ dictionary.\" She looked closer. \"Or is this sea lavender? And what is that?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"‘Sympathy,'\" Norret supplied quickly. \"And you are correct. It\
  \ is sea lavender.\"</p> \n    <p>\"The ‘sympathy' that's used by sorcerers or the\
  \ type that goes with tea?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Does it matter?\"</p> \n    <p>She dimpled.\
  \ \"Always.\" She tucked the nosegay into the front of her bodice, between breasts\
  \ each bigger than her giant bee. \"A worshiper of Blackfingers, I take it?\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"What makes you say that?\"</p> \n    <p>She winked and gestured to\
  \ Norret's face. \"It's not a mask, but a patched eyed gives an air of mystery...\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Just a war wound,\" my brother explained self-consciously, leaving\
  \ important bits out, like the fact that he'd since used alchemy to heal it, or\
  \ that he'd also got some magic mercury in it, making it look a bit odd. And in\
  \ Galt, odd was not good unless you were looking for a place in one of the tumbrel\
  \ carts headed for the guillotine.</p> \n    <p>One of those was finally headed\
  \ through the crowd now, and a cheer went up.</p> \n    <p>\"Oh come, join me,\"\
  \ the woman said. \"Only the tricoteuses have a better seat...\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  The knitters,\" Norret explained to my baffled expression. \"The market women there.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>I looked. Right in front of the Monolith, Isarn's prison and Hall\
  \ of Justice, was the guillotine with its famous Final Blade known as Madame Margaery.\
  \ And right there before Margaery's basket with the very best front-row seats was\
  \ a group of women like you'd see at any market, with aprons and white caps fitted\
  \ with ribbons. Every last one of them was knitting.</p> \n    <p>\"How might we\
  \ address our hostess, O beauteous demimondaine?\"</p> \n    <p>Norret liked big\
  \ words and flowery talk, but from the way she laughed and smiled, I guessed that\
  \ this was a really nice word for ‘dollymop.' \"You may call me ‘Mistress Philomela.'\
  \ And this,\" she said gesturing to her giant bumblebee, \"is Honeybun.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"A pleasure to make your acquaintance, Mistress Philomela. I am Norret\
  \ Gantier and this is my brother and apprentice, Orlin.\"</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n     <br> \"A Calistrian priestess can be a good friend to\
  \ have, but you don't want to get on her bad side.\"\n    </div> \n    <p>I tugged\
  \ my forelock. \"Pleased to meet you.\"</p> \n    <p>She made space for us on the\
  \ divan, which was feathery soft and upholstered in yellow silk, the brocade done\
  \ with a pattern of vines and blossoms and what looked like skulls. \"The fell and\
  \ fabled creeper,\" Mistress Philomela explained, seeing Norret's interest in the\
  \ floral theme. \"The pollen produces the most fabulous yellow dye and is of great\
  \ use in charms of passion and fascination.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Truly?\" asked Norret,\
  \ touching the silk.</p> \n    <p>\"So I've been told,\" the dollymondaine admitted.\
  \ \"It's from before the Revolution. It might be saffron from Jalmeray or just common\
  \ dyer's weld.\" She smiled conspiratorially. \"I've also been told that if you\
  \ can obtain honey from that particular vine, you can make a mead that acts as a\
  \ love philtre.\" She reached for a decanter filled with a pale golden liquid and\
  \ poured each of us a crystal flute full, as well as a shallow dish for Honeybun.\
  \ The bee crawled off her shoulder and began to lap it up. \"This hydromel comes\
  \ from the flowers of Calistria, the honeysuckle that we... used to grow here,\"\
  \ she finished lamely, looking at the window boxes filled with carrots and horse\
  \ apples.</p> \n    <p>Her look continued beyond. Ever heard the expression \"to\
  \ look daggers\" at someone? Well, these weren't just normal daggers, but Calistria's,\
  \ tipped with all of the revenge goddess's wasp venom, and they were aimed straight\
  \ at the line of knitting women in front of the guillotine. I half expected the\
  \ three little patches on Mistress Philomela's face to go flying after them.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"A toast,\" she said, raising her glass, \"to the wisdom of the market\
  \ wives who convinced the Revolutionary Council that every citizen, regardless of\
  \ station or vows, should grow a victory garden of vegetables, to feed themselves\
  \ and the hungry folk of Isarn...\"</p> \n    <p>\"To victory,\" said Norret, raising\
  \ his glass.</p> \n    <p>\"And horse apples,\" I said, raising mine.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>Mistress Philomela nearly choked, then added smoothly, \"Yes, and to the wisdom\
  \ to use the effluence of the streets to fertilize our gardens...\"</p> \n    <p>She\
  \ and Norret both drank, and I did too, after checking for poison.</p> \n    <p>I\
  \ don't quite understand it, but Norret said he used unicorn horn in the potion\
  \ to bring me back to life, so some of the unicorn's magic must have stuck to me.\
  \ Which means I can tell if there's poison in something.</p> \n    <p>There wasn't\
  \ any poison in the hydromel beyond a bit of alcohol, so I drank it. Then I drank\
  \ some more. And a little more after that. It was good. I was only able to watch\
  \ a couple beheadings before my own head hit the pillow at the top of the divan\
  \ and I fell sound asleep.</p> \n    <p>I awoke in a room that was definitely not\
  \ the balcony of the temple of Calistria. Instead of soft silk and swansdown, my\
  \ pillow was linen over bedstraw, and the room was plain and a little cobwebbed.\
  \ My brother was there as well, talking to one of the market women. She had her\
  \ knitting put away, but the bag was by her feet, and she looked very old—at least\
  \ fifty.</p> \n    <p>\"So who told you I had a room for let?\" the woman asked.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Someone in the crowd,\" Norret lied. I know when my brother lies—the\
  \ corners of his eyes go all crinkly. \"I gave them a nosegay and they gave me some\
  \ advice. Said you ran a boarding house with good food and weren't averse to alchemy\
  \ or magic since you had some skill yourself.\"</p> \n    <p>The woman clicked her\
  \ front teeth together. \"Well, that much is true, but—\" She paused, and then her\
  \ small black eyes met mine, magnified and multiplied by little half-moon spectacles\
  \ that made her look like she had four or more eyes. \"Ah, he's awake.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>She turned to me and I became acutely aware that my bed was in the corner\
  \ of the room. \"Young citizen, your brother informs me you're called ‘Orlin.' You\
  \ may address me as ‘Madame Eglantine' or ‘Grandmother Eglantine,' as you prefer,\
  \ or just as ‘Madame' or ‘Grandmother.' I will not answer to ‘Eglantine' by itself,\
  \ for only my husbands addressed me as such, and they are all now dead.\" She smoothed\
  \ her skirts. \"Aside from that, a few other rules: I serve breakfast a half hour\
  \ after sunrise and supper an hour before sundown. If you arrive at other times,\
  \ you must make do with what's on the sideboard. The only exception is on days when\
  \ there is an execution, when I shall be joining my fellow ladies for our knitting\
  \ circle. On execution days, I set out a cold buffet. Take what you need but leave\
  \ the rest for the other guests. Don't be greedy but don't expect there will be\
  \ anything left by suppertime either.\"</p> \n    <p>She placed her hands on her\
  \ hips, her long fingers digging into the fabric of her apron. \"As you're from\
  \ Dabril, I also expect you to be of great help to me in the garden.\" She fixed\
  \ me with a steely glare. \"Beyond that, both I and my guests value our privacy.\
  \ That means that locked doors are to be respected and keyholes are not to be peeped\
  \ through. This goes especially true for my private apartments in the attic. If\
  \ you pry, you may get what you deserve. That said, if someone breaks into your\
  \ chambers and blows themselves up with, say, an exploding book, you are responsible\
  \ for both the damage and the cleaning.\"</p> \n    <p>She paused then, placing\
  \ a finger to her lips, then added, \"As for cleaning, I expect you to tidy up after\
  \ yourselves. The only thing I forbid is harming the spiders, both in the garden\
  \ and in the house. They are here to catch the dirty flies and those nasty wasps.\
  \ Leave their webs alone and let the little darlings do their work. Any questions?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>I could only shake my head dumbly.</p> \n    <p>\"Good,\" she said.\
  \ \"Welcome to my house. I expect to see you tomorrow at breakfast.\"</p> \n   \
  \ <p>With that, she left, and the door latch clicked shut behind her.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>Norret turned to me and I said one word. \"Poison.\"</p> \n    <p>\"What?\"\
  \ said Norret.</p> \n    <p>\"Poison,\" I repeated. \"I'm detecting poison.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Norret didn't normally question the new sense I'd picked up, but he glanced\
  \ to the door and then back. \"The old lady? She has poison, or she's been poisoned?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Neither,\" I said. \"She <i>is</i> poison.\"</p> \n    <p><b>Coming\
