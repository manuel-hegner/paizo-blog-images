  articlebody\"> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Today <a href=\"/rpgsuperstar\"\
  >we reveal our Top 16</a>, who have survived the Open Call of creating magic items,\
  \ and the dreaded Map Round (which is the newest of our challenges, having just\
  \ been introduced last year). These 16 worthy contestants now have until September\
  \ 17 to submit their entries following the <a href=\"/rpgsuperstar/round3Rules\"\
  >Official Rules for round 3</a>.</p> \n     <p>So as we turn our thoughts to Round\
  \ 3, both voters and contestants are likely to wonder what judges are looking for\
  \ in an RPG Superstar monster entry. Luckily, two of our judges have offered fairly\
  \ extensive thoughts on that question. Developer Adam Daigle has a <a href=\"/threads/rzs2qk8e\"\
  >whole thread</a> with more than a years worth of advice, obsercvations, and commentary!\
  \ Adam has been in charge of assigning and developing so many freelance monsters\
  \ for Paizo over the years that \"I write monsters for Adam\" is a common identifying\
  \ statement as at any Pathfinder-freelancer gathering.</p> \n     <p>Our other judge\
  \ to offer specific notes about monster design is Neil Spicer, a winner of RPG Superstar\
  \ and one of our most prolific and popular judges. I offer his advice below, as\
  \ he sent it to me.</p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p>\"Going into monster design,\
  \ a freelance designer has to recognize certain basic elements of the game (IE:\
  \ the give-and-take of all the variables upon which it's mechanically founded).\
  \ The most important defining characteristic (which has a trickle down effect) in\
  \ monster design is its Challenge Rating (CR). The rules for Round 3 will either\
  \ tell you what that'll be, or you'll have to determine it for yourself (IE: CR\
  \ X). Thus, the \"test\" for the monster round isn't just determining if you can\
  \ cook up a really great idea for a monster. That's expected! But, it's also to\
  \ see how well you can interpret what a CR X monster is meant to have, mechanically-speaking,\
  \ that distinguishes it from a CR X-1 or a CR X+1 monster.</p> \n      <p>Aside\
  \ from the mechanical aspects of what a CR X monster should generally have (which\
  \ can be derived from the table for monster design in the Core Rulebook), you've\
  \ also got to know certain foundational elements about monsters. For instance, unlike\
  \ NPCs, monsters should be built around the non-standard array for their ability\
  \ scores (IE: 11, 11, 11, 10, 10, 10) before applying racial adjustments. Any adjustments\
  \ after that should always come in even-numbered increments (IE: +2, +4, +6, etc.).\
  \ That means for a basic monster design (one without class levels), you should end\
  \ up with three odd-numbered ability score values and three even-numbered ability\
  \ score values. Personally, I think you should also decide on a monster's role (combat,\
  \ skill, spell, etc.) to get an idea of which ability scores should stand out versus\
  \ which should be more muted. Monster roles are also a good guideline for determining\
  \ what kind of society intelligent monsters come from and how they think.</p> \n\
  \      <p>Lastly, once you've got that foundation, you can start building in universal\
  \ monster abilities, special abilities, and other considerations to round out what\
  \ makes your monster unique and special. In my opinion, for RPG Superstar, I think\
  \ the wisest course in monster design is to demonstrate two things: 1) the ability\
  \ to blend in existing abilities and rules by referencing them the proper way rather\
  \ than reinventing the wheel and wasting word count, and 2) the ability to innovate\
  \ while showing us something entirely new with a signature special ability that\
  \ gives us a new way to surprise players with what your monster can do. Now all\
  \ of that is on top of having a really compelling idea for a monster that fits its\
  \ design niche and the terrain in which you'd find it. The monster design round\
  \ is once again that perfect blend of Superstar ideas built with Superstar execution,\
  \ both in the mechanical side of things and the professional polish you bring with\
  \ your submission.</p> \n      <p>So, that's pretty much my baseline tactics for\
  \ creating monsters as well as how I tend to assess them when judging for RPG Superstar\
  \ and voting alongside the general public. I look for maximized creativity around\
  \ an interesting idea, and then execute it to the best of my ability using the existing\
  \ rules and monster abilities in the game, as well as crafting something new to\
  \ give my monster a unique identity/niche at the gaming table.\"</p> \n     </blockquote>\
  \ \n     <p>There you have it! I also encourage both contestants and voters to read\
  \ through both the <a href=\"/rpgsuperstar/rules\">Official Rules</a> for the entire\
  \ contest, and the rules for Round 3, to ensure that every requirement is met, and\
  \ that everyone understands what this round is (and isn't) about.</p> \n     <p>So\
  \ shut the city gate, batten down the hatches, light the torches, and call out the\
  \ guard. The monsters are coming!</p> \n     <p>Owen K.C. Stephens<br> <i>Developer,\
  \ RPG Superstar Host</i></p> \n    </div> \n   </blockquote> <!-- tags: RPG Superstar\
