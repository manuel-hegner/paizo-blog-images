  \ <p class=\"date\">by Gary Kloster</p> \n   <h2>Chapter Three: Taba's Hunt</h2>\
  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">\"It's not\
  \ really Dahren's boat.\" Khair was slimmer than his companion, and a little taller,\
  \ but with their beards and clothes they looked similar. Related, or just foreign,\
  \ Jiri wasn't sure and didn't really care. She sat with Fumo and Hadzi in the cracked\
  \ prow of the ship, under the watchful eye of half a dozen hunters. The hunters\
  \ were Jall tribe, Jiri knew, from their short, dyed braids and the pattern of their\
  \ mud cloth, but they hadn't introduced themselves. They were far from their lands\
  \ in the east, working for foreigners and being rude.</p> \n    <p>\"He was renting\
  \ the boat from some village we found upriver. It was taking us to Kibwe, before\
  \ that storm washed it away.\" Khair smiled at them, and he almost seemed sincere.\
  \ \"Thank you for finding it for us.\"</p> \n    <p>\"What's he saying?\" Hadzi\
  \ whispered to Jiri. The men from Nex used only Taldane, the common trade tongue,\
  \ except when they whispered together in Kelish. Jiri understood Taldane fine, but\
  \ while Oza had taught her a little Kelish she could barely make out a word of the\
  \ men's whispers. </p> \n    <p>\"He thanks us for finding their treasure,\" Jiri\
  \ said.</p> \n    <p>\"Are they going to reward us for that?\" Fumo muttered. The\
  \ man had seemed to age twenty years the moment the foreigners had showed up.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"I think that thanks was their reward,\" Jiri said, then turned her\
  \ attention back to Khair.</p> \n    <p>The man was waiting patiently, his fingers\
  \ combing through his tightly curled beard. \"We could use a new boat, now. Does\
  \ your village have one?\"</p> \n    <p>\"No,\" Jiri said. </p> \n    <p>\"Ah,\"\
  \ Khair sighed. \"I suppose we'll just have to patch this one up then. More days\
  \ lost in this stinking, leech-infested jungle.\" He shook his head and turned away,\
  \ still stroking his beard, and Jiri had a sudden, fervent hope that at least a\
  \ few leeches would someday find their way into that carefully tended garden of\
  \ hair. </p> \n    <p>\"Nexians.\" Fumo's fists drummed against the ships ribs.\
  \ \"A Nexian trader cheated my brother-in-law's youngest sister once, in Kibwe.\
  \ You can't trust them.\" </p> \n    <p><i>Because they won't let you take their\
  \ lost property?</i></p> \n    <p>Jiri didn't bother to say the words. The Nexians\
  \ and their Jall hirelings were rude, but they hadn't treated them badly otherwise,\
  \ and the fact that they were going to be hauling that great gem away from Thirty\
  \ Trees didn't bother Jiri a bit.</p> \n    <p><i>Whatever that thing is, treasure\
  \ or not, it's trouble.</i> She watched Khair and Dahren come together in the center\
  \ of the boat and leaned forward as they spoke, straining her ears. They spoke too\
  \ fast, but she picked out the words for <i>boat</i> and <i>trade, daylight</i>\
  \ and... <i>baby? Child?</i> That didn't seem right. Jiri sighed and wished she\
  \ had studied harder when Oza had taught her languages.</p> \n    <p><i>It's not\
  \ my fault that there are so many.</i> She wondered when the Nexians would finally\
  \ let them go. <i>When they think their gem is safe, I suppose.</i> Dahren had opened\
  \ up the broken crate to carefully examine the stone, revealing it to be a huge\
  \ oval, like a seed made of glass that gleamed in the steady glow of his spell-light.\
  \ She watched them stare at it as they talked, Dahren's face calculating, Khair's\
  \ frowning, anxious but trying to hide it, and wondered again what it was.</p> \n\
  \    <p><i>They're certainly acting like it's a treasure. But Khair seems almost\
  \ afraid of it.</i> A gem. A hippo-sized gem. <i>What is it?</i> The question buzzed\
  \ in Jiri's head, almost making a connection but not quite, almost... <i>What did\
  \ Dahren say about a child? No, it wasn't that, or baby, the word was—</i></p> \n\
  \    <p>\"Hatchling.\" Jiri whispered the word, and she was on her feet, staring\
  \ at the great gem in horror. Oza <i>had</i> told her about something like this.\
  \ He had told her about all the things that lived in the jungle around them, small\
  \ and great. The size of it, though—that had tricked her. Not even the mokele-mbembe\
  \ laid eggs this great.</p> \n    <p>\"Khair.\" Jiri walked toward the trader, ignoring\
  \ the Jall. They looked down at her, at the muddy medicine pouch that hung on her\
  \ hip and proclaimed her a shaman, and let her by. \"Do you know what that is?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"I know what Dahren thinks it is. And what it's worth to the fleshforges\
  \ back home, if he's right.\"</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\">\n     <a href=\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>When profit awaits, Dahren is willing to take any risk.</i>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>\"You'll never get it there,\" Jiri said. \"Touch it. You can\
  \ feel something moving inside. It's close to hatching.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Jiri, what\
  \ are you—\" Fumo started, but Dahren cut him off. </p> \n    <p>\"If it hatches,\
  \ we'll cage it.\"</p> \n    <p>Jiri stared at the foreigner, stunned by his idiocy.\
  \ \"You think you can cage a grootslang?\" </p> \n    <p>\"Grootslang?\" Hadzi said\
  \ behind her. \"What are you saying about a groot—\"</p> \n    <p>\"One fresh-hatched?\
  \ Yes.\" Dahren stared down at Jiri as if she were something he had found crawling\
  \ across his skin. \"We've put together a cage, a wagon, a whole caravan for this\
  \ beast. It's taken me almost seven years to find something of value in this green\
  \ hell, and I will make my fortune from it, mosquitoes, snakes, sickness, storms,\
  \ sinking boats, and short, bothersome natives be damned. Now shut up and leave\
  \ me alone, so I can take this beast that scares you so much far from your fetid\
  \ home.\"</p> \n    <p>\"A caravan,\" Jiri said. \"You're taking this thing to Kibwe.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Only for a little while,\" Khair said, trying to sound soothing.\
  \ \"We'll be moving on as soon as we can.\"</p> \n    <p>\"You can't take a monster\
  \ like that to a city,\" Jiri snapped. \"How many will die when that thing hatches\
  \ out, hungry?\"</p> \n    <p>\"It won't get free!\" Dahren shouted, his face twisting\
  \ into anger. \"Gods, I've had this argument enough with him.\" He jabbed his finger\
  \ at Khair. \"I don't need to have it with you, girl. Now shut up before I gag you.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Jiri watched him stomp away, then looked over at the Jall hunter who\
  \ stood closest to her. \"Did you know what you were helping them do?\"</p> \n \
  \   <p>The woman pushed her yellow braids back and shrugged. \"Our shaman told us\
  \ what they had found. We decided that if they wanted to take it far from our lands,\
  \ we wouldn't argue. And they pay well.\"</p> \n    <p>\"And if that thing hatches\
  \ here? Or in Kibwe?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Then that's their problem.\" The voice came\
  \ from Jiri's other side, from a man who stood taller and broader than any of the\
  \ other Jall. The skin of his chest was marked with the rough, twisting scars of\
  \ leopard claws. \"Or yours, I suppose, if they can't hold it.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  You're a blessing to your ancestors,\" Jiri growled and sat down beside Hadzi again,\
  \ staring at the huge egg. The light caught in its rough facets shimmered, as if\
  \ the whole huge thing had trembled.</p> \n    <p>\"A grootslang?\" Hadzi said.\
  \ \"Like in the stories?\"</p> \n    <p>Jiri nodded. Oza had told them all the legend\
  \ of the grootslang. How the gods had made them too powerful, and how they had taken\
  \ them apart, separating their forms into serpents and elephants. But some had escaped\
  \ the gods, and stayed what they were.</p> \n    <p>Deadly.</p> \n    <p>From her\
  \ other side, she heard Fumo. \"I— Why didn't you tell us? Why didn't you know?\"\
  </p> \n    <p> Blocking Fumo out, Jiri stared at the egg, and watched as it shook\
  \ again.</p> \n    <p style=\"text-align: center;\">∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n    <p>When morning\
  \ came, the river had dropped enough to reveal that the boat was thoroughly stranded,\
  \ wedged into the trees that had caught it in a mud bank yards away from the river's\
  \ normal edge.</p> \n    <p>Dahren had cursed, then told the Jall to start pulling\
  \ apart the boat to make a raft, which they had done after he had offered up enough\
  \ coin. Fumo and Hadzi, with nothing else to do, had taken some of that coin and\
  \ gone to work, too.</p> \n    <p>Jiri just stood near the boat, exhausted from\
  \ a sleepless night, and watched the gemlike egg.</p> \n    <p>\"How long do you\
  \ think we have?\" Khair stood next to her, his boots almost swallowed by the mud.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"How long has it been shaking like that?\" Jiri asked.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Since we found it. About three weeks. Dahren says it will take it a long time for\
  \ it to crack that shell.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Three weeks is a long time,\" Jiri said.\
  \ </p> \n    <p>Khair swore softly. \"I've put too much money into this. If that\
  \ thing gets away...\"</p> \n    <p>\"My village is nearby, along with everyone\
  \ I know and love,\" Jiri said. \"Your coin—\"</p> \n    <p>There was a sound, a\
  \ brittle pop that brought Jiri up short. \"Gods and crocodiles,\" she hissed, and\
  \ ran forward. The crack didn't take long to find, a thing as long as her arm and\
  \ wide as her smallest finger, running across the top of the egg. She tore her eyes\
  \ away from it, saw the Nexians and the Jall, Fumo and Hadzi, all standing still\
  \ and staring at the stone.</p> \n    <p>\"Gods damn me.\" Dahren came forward,\
  \ staring at the crack. \"I'll not lose this thing now.\"</p> \n    <p>\"You have\
  \ no cage here,\" Jiri said.</p> \n    <p>Dahren spared a glare for her, then shouted.\
  \ \"Taba!\" The tall, scarred Jall came through the mud to him. \"You're always\
  \ bragging about your hunting. Well, here's a chance to demonstrate your skill.\
  \ When that thing breaks free, kill it and I'll fill your palm with gold.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Dahren!\" Khair shouted. \"It's worth so much more alive!\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"It's worth nothing if it gets away!\" Dahren backed off as Taba took up\
  \ a spear and found a position beside the stone.</p> \n    <p>\"This is a bad idea,\
  \ Taba,\" Jiri told him, but the man shrugged.</p> \n    <p>\"I killed a leopard\
  \ with just a knife once. I can kill a newborn monster with a spear.\"</p> \n  \
  \  <p>Jiri backed away, until she reached Fumo and Hadzi. \"Go,\" she told them.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Fumo looked at her, his eyes wide with fear, and started to back away.\
  \ None of the Jall cared. But Hadzi hesitated. \"What are you doing?\"</p> \n  \
  \  <p>\"I have to see what happens. You have to go.\" From the wreckage of the boat\
  \ came another sharp pop, and even from here Jiri could see the cracks running across\
  \ the surface of the egg. \"Go. Get to Kibwe. Get Oza. Go!\"</p> \n    <p>Fumo reached\
  \ out, caught Hadzi's arm and pulled him after. \"May all the spirits be with you,\
  \ shaman,\" he said, his farewell sounding formal, final. Then they were gone into\
  \ the jungle.</p> \n    <p>Clenching her fists, Jiri turned back toward the boat\
  \ and started walking forward. In her hands, she could feel heat building, could\
  \ feel the fire that came so easily to her when she was angry or scared, and she\
  \ welcomed it. The egg trembled again, and this time a plate of clear gemstone the\
  \ size of Jiri's head cracked free, sliding down from the top of the stone. Something\
  \ flickered behind it, and Taba raised his spear, the heavy muscles of his back\
  \ tightening. Everyone else was silent, still, watching.</p> \n    <p>The attack\
  \ came fast as a lightning stroke. </p> \n    <p>Something whipped out of the hole\
  \ that had been broken in the egg, something thin and flexible, like a rope of scale\
  \ and muscle. It wrapped around Taba's waist, catching him and then slamming him\
  \ forward into the egg. Jiri could hear the wet snap of bone breaking beneath flesh,\
  \ and then there came another sound, a sharp, liquid noise, like branches cracking\
  \ in mud, and Taba's body jerked. The smooth skin of his back broke, and there were\
  \ six points jutting out of it, white things covered in red gore, needle sharp and\
  \ long as speartips. Then they vanished, and Taba fell, crashing down at the base\
  \ of the egg, flopping limply back like a broken doll. </p> \n    <p>The scars the\
  \ leopard claws had left on him were gone, lost in the red ruin of what had been\
  \ his chest.</p> \n    <p>The Jall ran then. Jiri barely noticed their flight, silent\
  \ and panicked through the mud and into the jungle, gone. She was too focused on\
  \ the egg, its shining surface now coated crimson.</p> \n    <p><i>Not here. Not\
  \ here, no, not here.</i></p> \n    <p>But the gleaming eggshell crumbled, falling\
  \ apart as the beast pulled its way out into the sun.</p> \n    <p><b>Coming Next\
