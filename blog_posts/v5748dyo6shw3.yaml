  \ \n     <br> \n     <p><b>Moderator: I understand Beadle &amp; Grimm’s Pandemonium\
  \ Warehouse is releasing its first ever premium Box edition of a Pathfinder Release.\
  \ Why <em>Absalom, City of Lost Omens?</em></b></p> \n     <p>Donk: Absalom is THE\
  \ iconic city in Golarion. Plus there’s danger lurking around every corner, so lots\
  \ of opportunity to make the characters’ lives miserable.</p> \n     <p><b>M: Pre-sales\
  \ of the Gold Edition begin on Black Friday, with 10% off to anyone who orders by\
  \ Nov 28th. Did you have any say in that?</b></p> \n     <p>[D]: Product doesn’\
  t really talk to marketing. There’s a high wall, three moats, and pit traps filled\
  \ with trolls between us and the marketing department. Our intradepartmental memos\
  \ are stuffed in the mouths of junior VPs who are exchanged via catapult nightly.\
  \ That said, I don’t disapprove. </p> \n     <p><b>M: I’ve heard the Gold Edition\
  \ comes with NPC cards that can hang on the GM screen, with artwork on the front\
  \ for players and roleplaying info on the back for the GM. What kinds of NPCs might\
  \ we expect?</b></p> \n     <p>[D]: You’ll see all the most interesting denizens\
  \ of Absalom: noble goblins, brave goblins, handsome goblins and brilliant goblins.\
  \ Probably some other things, too, but I really haven’t checked.</p> \n     <div\

  \ alt=\"Absalom building mock up cards with art on one side and information on the\
  \ other\"></a>\n     </div> \n     <br> \n     <p><b>M: It also comes with location\
  \ cards. Artwork of the building or location on front, background information on\
  \ the back. We’ve never seen that before from the Warehouse. Why now?</b></p> \n\
  \     <p>[D]: Locations cards really help you understand where you are at all times.\
  \ If you’re a member of the Pathfinder Society, that’s great for their motto of\
  \ “Explore, Report, Cooperate”. And if you’re a member of the Bloody Barbers, it’\
  s perfect for their motto of, “Bury the bodies further from the house.”</p> \n \
  \    <p><b>M: I’m surprised a goblin would come up with wearable faction jewelry\
  \ for players. What was your inspiration?</b></p> \n     <p>[D]: We take special\
  \ pride in our jewelry pieces. They’re designed by our crack jewelry designers,\
  \ and lovingly crafted from the fillings ripped out of the teeth of marketing goblin\
  \ project coordinators. Reduce, reuse, recycle, but without the reduce part—we call\
  \ that “maximizing operational efficiency.”</p> \n     <p><b>M: I see. So, you included\
  \ several short bonus adventures in this Gold Edition. How do you expect GMs to\
  \ use these?</b></p> \n     <p>[D]: Our original design mandate for the bonus encounters\
  \ was that they would be a short, sharp way to terrorize an adventuring party, complete\
  \ with large battle maps to mark where the characters fell.</p> \n     <p><b>M:\
  \ Oh, so you also include large battle maps? </b></p> \n     <p>[D]: Battles are\
  \ more fun if you know where you are and what’s around you. After all, the difference\
  \ in a five foot square is sometimes the difference between living to fight another\
  \ day and your fellow party members looting your corpse.</p> \n     <p><b>M: There’\
  s quite a bit more that will come in the box that I saw on <a href=\"https://www.beadleandgrimms.com/pathfinder/absalom\"\
  >beadleandgrimms.com/pathfinder/absalom</a>. How would you rate your website goblins?</b></p>\
  \ \n     <p>[D]: In general, our website goblins aren’t worth the cost of the oil\
  \ to boil them. On the rare occasion that they actually manage to make the website\
  \ work properly, we hold a party with floats and cake.</p> \n     <p><b>M: Any last\
  \ quote you’d like to leave our readers with? Words of wisdom?</b></p> \n     <p>[D]:\
  \ If you open your windows after sundown, and if the wind is blowing just right,\
  \ you can hear the screams of the mighty warehouse engines coming to life. They’\
  re ready—nay, eager—to build something great for the Pathfinder audience, and I\
  \ think the product department has really knocked it out of the park. Assuming the\
  \ website goblins can keep the site up and the marketing department doesn’t go berserk\
  \ and start handing the boxes out with happy meals, we should be in for a good ride.</p>\
