  \ Thoughts: Week 2</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, December 3, 2013</p> \n\
  \   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">The Advanced\
  \ Class Guide Playtest continues to roll along and the design team has been getting\
  \ some great feedback from the boards. It's been a busy week; we've made changes\
  \ to the arcanist, launched the playtest survey, and stuffed ourselves on Thanksgiving.\
  \ This week, we'll take a look at those in detail and cast an eye toward the upcoming\
  \ revisions.</span></p> \n    <p>Late in the day on Wednesday, we released a revised\
  \ version of the arcanist, swapping out the blood focus class feature for a new\
  \ mechanic designed to give the class flexibility along with a clearer and better\
  \ sense of role in the game. The arcanist gained an arcane reservoir that she can\
  \ draw upon to fuel exploits (special class features that let her tinker with the\
  \ forces of magic). She can consume her own spell slots to fill up her reservoir\
  \ and can even learn to siphon such power from magic items and enemy spells. If\
  \ you have not seen the update, forums right <a href=\"http://paizo.com/threads/rzs2qel1\"\
  >go to the forum post here</a>. We aren't done with this class quite yet, but it's\
  \ a step in the right direction.</p> \n    <p>The other big news last week was the\
  \ launch of the playtest surveys. Each class has its own questionnaire, allowing\
  \ us the gauge their interest, power, and versatility. The great thing is that you\
  \ can update the survey as the playtest continues, meaning that we can see how opinions\
  \ and ideas for each class change as time goes on. This also means it is vital for\
  \ you to fill out your survey now, so that when you change it later, we can get\
  \ a sense of whether or not we are heading in the right direction. <a href=\"http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/advancedClassGuide/survey\"\
  >You can find the surveys right here</a>. Of special note, please base your arcanist\
  \ survey answers off the original version of the class, not the revised version\
  \ on the messageboards.</p> \n    <p>Let's take this chance to share some feedback\
  \ from the survey. We asked the same eight questions about each of the classes,\
  \ and we found some interesting trends. </p> \n    <p>The first two questions are\
  \ about comparing each class with its two parent base classes. For example, the\
  \ shaman questions compare the shaman to the oracle and the witch. Most of the classes\
  \ are falling relatively close to their parents, but there are some outliers. The\
  \ original version of the arcanist is seen as being more powerful than its parents,\
  \ but I think the revision will normalize those numbers a bit. On the other hand,\
  \ people are seeing the skald as being a bit weaker than its parents. The big winner\
  \ here was the shaman, which most feel is pretty close to the mark as compared to\
  \ its parent classes.</p> \n    <p>Next up, we ask whether the theme of the class\
  \ matches its mechanics. The bloodrager and slayer were the big winners here, while\
  \ the hunter and the warpriest need some work.</p> \n    <p>Our fourth question\
  \ looks at how each class is presented in terms of clarity and ease of use. The\
  \ slayer once again comes out on top here, along with the investigator. Interestingly,\
  \ this is the only question in which the shaman gets some poor marksâ€”understandable\
  \ considering how the spirit and wandering spirit mechanic plays out.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>Next, we ask you two questions: one comparing the class in terms of power and\
  \ balance to the other playtest classes, and another comparing it to all of the\
  \ other classes in the game. The shaman and skald once again show that they need\
  \ some work in this department, while the brawler, investigator, shaman, and slayer\
  \ are all falling closer to the mark.</p> \n    <p>The seventh question asks whether\
  \ the class has enough options and versatility. The head of class here is the bloodrager,\
  \ investigator, and shaman. At the other end, it's clear that the skald and swashbuckler\
  \ need a few more options added to their frameworks.</p> \n    <p>Finally, we look\
  \ to gauge your interest in playing the class. Not surprisingly, the bloodrager,\
  \ investigator, shaman, and swashbuckler are all pretty high on the list. The hunter,\
  \ skald, and warpriest are lagging behind, which is key feedback.</p> \n    <p>What\
  \ all does this tell us? First off, that some of the classes are getting close to\
  \ where they need to be. They're not done, and they still need a lot of polish and\
  \ refinement, but they probably don't need any major revisions. Others need to see\
  \ some big changes to get them closer to the standard we're striving for. We aren't\
  \ basing mechanical decisions solely off survey responses, but it will help us understand\
  \ how our upcoming changes impact the consensus opinion.</p> \n    <p>And that brings\
  \ me to my final point: barring any catastrophes, we are hoping to release a revised\
  \ version of the playtest document sometime in the next week. Once we release that\
  \ document, we will be calling on folks to update their surveys as soon as they\
  \ have gotten a chance to read through them and run them out for a test drive. Remember,\
  \ the surveys and playtest forums will remain open through Tuesday, December 17th.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Thanks again for taking part! We'll see you on the boards.</p> \n   \
