<h1>Paizo Annouces Japan Relief Auction</h1>
<p class=date>Thursday March 31, 2011</p>

<p>Yesterday we published on the blog the official "Meet the Iconics" for Nakayama Hayato, the iconic samurai from the city of Oda in distant Minkai. The son of the chief falconer and his wife, Hayato&mdash;whose name means "falcon"&mdash;quickly proved just as proficient with the dangerous birds as his father, emulating their proud and fierce natures. In time, Hayato grew to become a powerful warrior, rising to the position of head samurai of the Nakayama holdings. When his master's son died in a drunken duel at the age of twenty, Lord Nakayama began to look more and more to Hayato as a son, even allowing him to take the family name. Hayato no longer lives in Minkai but now makes his home in the Inner Sea region, upholding the samurai code he has sworn. </p>

<p>In yesterday's blog post we announced that, in partnership with Wayne Reynolds, Paizo would auction the original painting of Hayato, along with staff-signed Special Edition copies of the <I>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</I> and <I>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</I>. These special edition copies of the rulebooks are limited to fewer than 100 copies each, and available only to Paizo staff members. But now, you can own a copy, too! With gilt pages and gold foil cover lettering, and signed by the entire Paizo staff and cover artist Wayne Reynolds, this collectible first printing merits a special place on your gaming bookshelf. All proceeds from the auctions will be donated to the Red Cross Society, an organization with extraordinary disaster response capabilities. It has mobilized eleven teams to heavily damaged communities in Japan to provide assessments and first aid and to supply emotional support and relief.</p>
<p>"All of us at Paizo have been devastated by the recent events in Japan, and when Wayne Reynolds contacted me with the idea to auction his original Pathfinder art, I knew this was a tangible way Paizo could help those impacted by the destruction," said CEO Lisa Stevens. "We're hoping to harness the power of our fans in an effort of goodwill to help those in need."</p>
<p>Hayato will appear in August 2011's <I>Ultimate Combat</I>, a 256-page hardcover reference that reveals the martial secrets of the Pathfinder RPG rules like never before. Hayato represents the samurai class, a warrior with more honor, dedication, and resolve than any other. Trained from an early age in the art of war and sworn to the service of a lord, the samurai holds a position of power and respect. In him, the common folk see honor and sacrifice. He is an honorable warrior, dedicated to the realm and the leaders that guide it. </p>

<p>To take part in this special charity auction please visit the <a href="http://shop.ebay.com/paizopublishing/m.html" target="nofollow">Paizo eBay storefront</a> and the Paizo website at <a href="/">paizo.com</a>.</p>

<p>Honor is strength. It is a maxim that Nakayama Hayato has known since birth, and one whose barbs he still feels deep in his flesh. Yet Hayato also knows a deeper truth: that just as a sword must bend to avoid breaking, so too must honor. And the more rigid the steel, the easier it shatters. </p>

</table></div>
<p>Hayato was born a retainer on the estate of Lord Nakayama Hitoshi, just a few days' ride from the great city of Oda in Minkai. The son of the chief falconer and his wife, Hayato&mdash;whose name means "falcon"&mdash;quickly proved just as proficient with the dangerous birds as his father, emulating their proud and fierce natures. </p>

<p>It was while accompanying his father on one of Lord Nakayama's hawking outings that he first came to the lord's attention. At eight years old, Hayato was assigned the honor of being the personal attendant to the lord's son, Masao, assisting the privileged child with his falcon. All went well until the noble son, still new to the sport, mishandled his bird and nearly lost an eye for his trouble. The furious lordling prepared to kill the falcon then and there, but Hayato interceded, explaining the boy's error. Enraged even further, Masao began beating Hayato, drawing the attention of the rest of the hunting party. Though Hayato bowed low and accepted the savage blows of his master, he neither cried out nor begged for mercy. When Masao finally tired, Lord Nakayama himself addressed the bloody servant child, asking him why he had been so bold as to correct his superior. Without faltering, Hayato bowed to the lord and said simply, "Because it was the truth." </p>

<p>From that point on, Lord Nakayama took the young Hayato under his wing, frequently assigning him duties within the manor house, engaging him as a companion for his son, and seeing to his education in matters both martial and intellectual. In time, Hayato grew to become a powerful warrior, rising to the position of head samurai of the Nakayama holdings. When Masao died in a drunken duel at the age of twenty, thus depriving Lord Nakayama of an official heir, the bereaved lord began to look more and more to Hayato as a son, even allowing him to take the family name.</p>

<p>Yet Masao's death was only the beginning of the Nakayama family's misfortune. It was shortly after this episode that the Nakayama estate was visited by Kaneka Yoshiro, a traveling lord and government official with a position high in the Imperial Court. With considerably more prestige and official sway than Nakayama, Kaneka was received with full honors&mdash;yet it quickly became apparent that the guest was interested in more than just hospitality. Within a few days, Kaneka's cunning insults, lewd advances toward Nakayama's wife, and barely concealed challenges to Nakayama himself left Hayato's lord with no choice. Honor forbade him from allowing the slights to stand unanswered, yet challenging a governmental superior was as good as a death sentence. </p>

<p>In the end, honor won out, just as Kaneka knew it would. Nakayama challenged Kaneka to a duel, and was quickly slain by the talented swordsman. In recompense for the "insult" Kaneka had suffered, the Imperial Court allotted all the Nakayama holdings to Kaneka. Nakayama's widow, faced with the prospect of a dishonored existence among peasants, had no choice but to accept Kaneka's proposal of marriage if she wanted to retain her position. </p>

<p>Though the Nakayama samurai were bound by direct order of the court to honor their new arrangement&mdash;and plied with substantial gifts by their new master&mdash;Hayato saw the theft for what it was. Several nights later, having watched Kaneka's celebrating guards drink themselves into unconsciousness, Hayato crept into his former master's bedchamber and confronted the usurper even as he lay sleeping with his new wife. Though Kaneka screamed for his retainers, in the end it became clear that his only option was to fight. Taking up the sword that Hayato tossed onto the bed, Kaneka did everything he could to kill the samurai quickly, yet Hayato would not be denied his revenge. At last, bleeding from several terrible wounds, Hayato succeeded in getting past the noble's guard, ending his short-lived dominion over the Nakayama estate in a fine spray of blood. </p>

<p>As Kaneka fell to the floor, pink froth spilling from his lips, Hayato dropped his sword and knelt beside it. Knowing that to attack any lord in this manner&mdash;let alone the man the government considered his rightful master&mdash;would bring sure execution, he drew his tanto and prepared to die with his honor intact. </p>

<p>A hand on his shoulder stayed his blade. When Hayato looked up, he beheld Lady Nakayama&mdash;now Lady Kaneka&mdash;in her dressing gown, its yellow silk stained with the blood of her most recent husband. With tears in her eyes, she thanked Hayato for avenging Lord Nakayama and returning the estate to her control. Yet with her next breath, she condemned him forever. Taking his hand in her own&mdash;an undreamed-of show of affection and familiarity&mdash;the noblewoman forbade Hayato from taking his own life. Instead, she snuck him out of the manor and into a carriage bound for Oda, with only a string of coins, his armor, and a command to live as best he could. When the morning sun rose, it found Hayato on a caravan traveling north, bound for the icy reaches of the Crown of the World and from there on to the mysterious lands of the Inner Sea. </p>

<p>Now in his mid-thirties, Hayato is a hard man who keeps to himself. Though he has long since learned to speak Taldane, he remains terse by nature, feeling that everyone in his new home speaks too much but says too little. He operates as a fearless and talented mercenary&mdash;or ronin, as he terms it&mdash;for those whose cause seem righteous, yet refuses to bow to anyone regardless of status, saying only that he has had his fill of masters. Hayato is loyal to those few friends who can get past his stone-faced demeanor, yet remains secretly tortured by his conflicting senses of honor. To continue living as a masterless samurai&mdash;let alone one who has committed a great crime&mdash;is shameful, yet to deny Lady Nakayama's command would be equally shameful. With no clear answer, Hayato has temporarily shelved the problem. Yet deep in his heart, he harbors a secret hope: that perhaps one day he might raise an army of champions and take it back over the Crown of the World, rooting out the corrupt politicians of his homeland and restoring the honor of himself, his adopted family, and the samurai code he was born to uphold.</p>

<h1><br>Monkey See, Monkey Do? An FAQ on Intelligent Animals</h1>
<p class=date>Tuesday, March 29, 2011</p>

<p>This is an odd FAQ item that we see pop up on occasion in a variety of different places. What happens when an animal gets an increased Intelligence score? There are a lot of different ways this can happen, and a number of strange routes that a GM could take when resolving this issue. Today, we are going to attempt to untangle this particular knot and see if we can't come up with some guidelines that make sense.</p>
  
<p>There are many ways an animal can gain intelligence. It can gain hit dice and apply its ability score boost to Int. It can gain the advanced simple template. A druid could cast <I>awaken</I> on it. Regardless of the source, an increase in Int comes with all of the standard bonuses, such as additional skill points. Once a creature's Int reaches 3, it also gains a language. This is where things start to get tricky. "Really, now my pet monkey can talk?" Well, not really. Allow me to explain.</p>

<p>Gaining a language does not necessarily grant the ability to speak. Most animals do not possess the correct anatomy for speech. While a very intelligent dolphin might be taught to understand Common, there's no way for him speak it. There is also the issue of learning the language. The rules are mostly silent on this front, due to ease of play for PCs, but a GM should feel safe in assuming that it might take years to actually teach Common to an intelligent animal. All of this, of course, assumes that the animal even bothers to fill that language slot. Possessing the ability to use a language does not necessarily mean that such an ability is utilized.</p>

<p>Another aspect of intelligent animals is tool use. There are a number of feats that convey an understanding and the proper use of weapons and armor. Generally speaking, these feats are off-limits to animals, but when their intelligence reaches 3, the rules state that they can use any feat that they are physically capable of using. Some people take this to mean that they can equip their animal companion in chainmail and arm him with a greatsword given the correct feats. While you could interpret the rules in this way, the "capable of use" clause is very important. Most weapons require thumbs to use properly, and even then, few animals would choose to use an artificial weapon in place of the natural weapons that have served them all their life. It's what they were born with, after all, and virtually no amount of training will change that. In the end, the GM should feel free to restrict such choices if he feels that they take away from the feel of his campaign. The rules themselves are left a little vague to give the GM the latitude to make the call that's right for his campaign.</p>

<p>The Handle Animal skill functions similarly no matter how intelligent an animal becomes. A character must still make Handle Animal checks to train his animal and get him to perform the appropriate tasks. A GM should, however, make exceptions in the case of how such an intelligent animal might react in absence of instructions. It might not know to unlock a door to escape a burning building&mdash;as that's a fact that's learned over time and experience&mdash;but a smart animal might have a better chance of finding a way out.</p>

<p>The spell <I>awaken</I> changes much of this, however, since the spell is specifically designed to raise a creature up to sentience. GMs should feel free to loosen the above guidelines in the case of animals who have been the subject of this spell (since they become magical beasts), but should also note that awakened animals do not continue to serve as animal companions or familiars. Such creatures gain their own desires and feelings, and may seek to set out on their own to determine their own fate. They may not leave right away, but GMs should keep in mind that eventually any such creatures (or trees) may wish to leave to find their fortune.</p>

<p>Note that while the monster guidelines talk about a maximum Int for an animal, this only applies to the creation process. Giving an animal a higher Intelligence score does not somehow transform it into a magical beast, unless the effect says otherwise, such as in the case of <I>awaken</I>. Animals can grow to have an Int higher than 2 through a variety of means, but they should not, as a general rule, be created that way.</p>

<p>Well, that about wraps up our look at intelligent animals. We hope these guidelines and ideas help inform the issue in your game. If you have any further questions on the topic, ask them in the comments to this blog. Until next time!</p>

<h1><br>The Future of Pathfinder Society Organized Play, Part II: Where Once There Were Five...</h1>
<p class=date>Monday, March 28, 2011</p>

<p>Since Hyrum and I first joined the Pathfinder Society Organized Play team last fall, we've had huge goals for what we wanted the campaign to be. Hyrum has coordinated organized play for huge networks of people in the past while working for Upper Deck Entertainment and had hopes of seeing Pathfinder Society reach the same number of players. Meanwhile, I began my foray into Pathfinder Society as a player and GM and wanted to see the concerns of the average participant addressed and the overall quality of the campaign continue to increase, and to explore the setting I loved to a whole new degree.</p>

<p>So we started plotting.</p>

<p>And after months of subtle hints and minor alterations to the status quo, we're ready to start announcing the larger changes that are on the horizon with Season 3. We started <a href="http://paizo.com/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lc0z">last week</a> with announcements of the conclusion of the Year of the Shadow Lodge metaplot and the <i>First Steps</i> intro adventure arc to be released in July. Every Monday between now and August 8 (the day after Gen Con ends), we'll have a new Pathfinder Society-related blog about some of the new or changing rules elements of the campaign.</p>

<p>First up: Factions!</p>

<p>When Pathfinder Society was announced roughly three years ago, players were promised in-world consequences for their actions within their factions. This competitive aspect of the campaign was abandoned at the end of Season 0, but we're bringing it back... sort of. Factions will matter more in the overall metaplot of the season, and successes reported in certain scenarios within a small window of time after release will influence future scenario development. Each faction will have its own storyline over the course of the season involving specific NPCs, locations, and events. If you want cool stuff to happen to or within a particular faction that season, complete your missions and report the results; if some factions have less than stellar performances, their stories may be less positive, but players' actions will still influence what does occur.</p>

<p>Also, there will be ten factions next season to expand the options available to players. The five existing factions aren't going anywhere (though those that didn't perform as well in the last three seasons may see some shakeups) and mechanics for existing members to change factions will be outlined. We'll be dedicating a blog post to each of the ten factions in the coming months&mdash;beginning in two weeks with the most successful faction to date.</p>

<p>Be sure to check back here next Monday for another big announcement about the future of the Pathfinder Society Organized Play campaign involving the official campaign rules documents.</p>

<h1><br>What Happens in the Worldwound Stays in the Worldwound</h1>
<p class=date>Friday, March 25, 2011</p>

<p>Oceans 666&mdash;that's the best short description for Robin Laws's <a href="/pathfinder/tales/v5748btpy8g7q"><i>The Worldwound Gambit</i></a> I've heard yet. <i>Gambit</i> is the fourth book in our <a href="/pathfinder/tales">Pathfinder Tales</a> line and will be coming out in May, just in time to tuck it away in a bag and head to the beach. In this novel, preternaturally handsome and coolly charismatic swindler Gad decides to assemble a team of thieves, cutthroats, and con men to take the fight into the magic-twisted hellscape known as the Worldwound, intent on striking directly at the fiendish leader responsible for a series of raids into the surrounding territory&mdash;the demon Yath, the Shimmering Putrescence. Can Gad hold his team together long enough to pull off the ultimate con, or will trouble from within his own organization lead to an untimely end for them all? You won't be able to find out for a few weeks, but until then you'll have plenty of time to gaze on this great piece by Daren Bader.</p>

<h1><br> RPG Superstar 2011 has a winner!</h1>
<p class=date>Tuesday, March 22, 2011</p>

<p>Paizo challenged amateur game designers from around the world to show off their skills in RPG Superstar 2011, the fourth season of Paizo's search for great undiscovered game designers. Judges Ryan Dancey, Sean K Reynolds, Mark Moreland, and Neil Spicer narrowed the field to 32 would-be RPG Superstars, and guest judges including Paizo designer Stephen Radney-MacFarland, cartographers Jared Blando and Robert Lazzaretti, and Paizo's Creative Director James Jacobs provided their advice as the contestants answered each new challenge.</p>

<p>In the final round, we asked this year's Top 4 to propose a 32-page Pathfinder Module for use with Paizo's <a href="/pathfinderRPG">Pathfinder Roleplaying Game</a>. Contestants Cody Coffelt (Boise, ID), Jerall Toi (Port Elizabeth, South Africa), Sam Zeitlin (Arlington, VA), and Sean McGowan (New York City, NY) responded with four excellent submissions, but there can be only one RPG Superstar 2011, and so after the judges offered comments, the general public selected one winning proposal to be published by Paizo in early 2012.</p>

<p>Congratulations to <b>Sam Zeitlin</b> for his victorious proposal, <i>Grasping at Shadows</i> which will be released as <b><i><a href="/pathfinder/modules/v5748btpy8joy">The Midnight Mirror</a></i></b>. Here's a brief description of the adventure from Sam Zeitlin's winning RPG Superstar 2011 submission:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A horror and investigation adventure for 4th-level characters.</p>

<p>In shadow-haunted Nidal, the denizens of the Plane of Shadow intermingle with the common man. Now people are disappearing, and it falls to the PCs to stop the terror. Faced with terrible shadow creatures, an unruly mob of scared citizens, and an unpredictable creature of light, can the heroes undo a greedy and uncaring noble's self-serving mistake?</p>

<p><i>The Midnight Mirror</i> is an adventure for 4th-level characters, written for the <i>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game</i> and compatible with the 3.5 edition of the world's oldest RPG. In addition to the adventure, this volume also features a brand-new monster and a gazetteer of a brand-new location in the shadow-tainted nation of Nidal.</p>

<p>Written by Sam Zeitlin, the winner of Paizo Publishing's RPG Superstar contest, which allows unpublished authors to compete before a panel of celebrity game designers and legions of their peers for the chance to write a Pathfinder Module.</p>

<p>Pathfinder Modules are 32-page, high-quality, full-color, adventures using the Open Game License to work with both the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game and the standard 3.5 fantasy RPG rules set. This Pathfinder Module includes new monsters, treasure, and a fully detailed bonus location that can be used as part of the adventure or in any other game!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As RPG Superstar 2011's Grand Prize, Paizo will contract Sam Zeitlin to write <i>The Midnight Mirror</i>, which we will release as a <a href="/pathfinder/modules">Pathfinder Module</a> in January, 2012.</p>

<p>But you don't have to wait until January to reserve your copy! Head over to the new <b><a href="/pathfinder/modules/v5748btpy8joy"><i>The Midnight Mirror</i> product page</a></b> here on paizo.com to preorder your copy of Sam Zeitlin's winning adventure! If you're already a Pathfinder Modules subscriber, <i>The Midnight Mirror</i> will arrive as part of your subscription.</p>

<p>On behalf of our judges as well as the whole Paizo Publishing family, congratulations to Cody Coffelt, Jerall Toi, and Sean McGowan. Though only contestant one earned the title of RPG Superstar 2011, for the first time in Paizo history, the runners up will be contracted to write a scenario for the Pathfinder Society, Paizo's organized play program. Keep an eye out in the months ahead for when these scenarios will be released. </p>

<p>And we'd like to offer one final thanks to you, the readers of paizo.com, and to anyone who submitted an entry or voted during RPG Superstar 2011.</p>

<p>And for those of you who didn't, RPG Superstar 2012 is less than a year away!</p>

<h1><br>I Drank What? An FAQ on Poison</h1>
<p class=date>Tuesday, March 22, 2011</p>
<a href="/gameMastery/itemPacks/v5748btpy8g7n"><img src="/image/content/CarrionCrown/PZO3017-Poison.jpg" border="0" align="right" hspace="9"/></a>
<p>For quite a while now there has been a bit of confusion on how poison is applied in the Pathfinder RPG. While the application of a single dose is simple enough, the rules allow for the stacking of poisons that causes them to combine into a more powerful effect. There are, unfortunately, some timing issues with these rules that can make poisons a bit tricky to adjudicate during play. Since this issue is a bit more complex than your average FAQ issue, the design team thought it would be a good idea to take a more in depth look at the issue here.</p>

<p>Poisons fall under the category of afflictions. They each have a save, a frequency, an effect, and a cure. At the most simple level, this means that when a character comes into contact with the poison, she gets a save. If the save succeeds, the poison has no effect, regardless of the cure entry. If the saving throw is failed, the character takes the effect and must continue to makes saves, dictated by the frequency, or continue to take the effect with each failed save. The only way to be free of the poison at this point is to meet the conditions of the cure entry, usually one or more successful saving throws (usually consecutively if more than one).</p>

<p>When a character is subject to more than 1 dose of the same poison, things get interesting. Each dose increases the DC by +2 and increases the total duration listed in the frequency by half of the original duration. Due to timing, however, this can make for a rather confusing situation. When does the DC increase apply? When are the saving throws made? When is the duration increased? To keep things simple, use the following guidelines.</p>

<p><b>1.</b> Whenever a character is exposed to a poison (regardless of method), that character gets a saving throw to negate the poison.<br>
<b>2.</b> The saving throw DC is increased by +2 for every active dose currently affecting the character. Poisons that were cured, have run through their entire frequency, or were negated with a successful initial saving throw do not increase the DC.<br>
<b>3.</b> The character must make a saving throw against every poison affecting him on his turn, but may make the saving throw at any point during his turn. If a poisoned character delays his turn, he must immediately make these saving throws. They are not delayed.<br>
<b>4.</b> Unless the poison has an onset time, the character takes the effect of the poison every time he fails a saving throw against the poison, even when additional doses are inflicted.<br>
<b>5.</b> The total duration of the poison listed in the frequency only increases by half the original duration and only when the initial saving throw against a dose is failed. If the initial saving throw is made, the duration is not increased.<br>
<b>6.</b> If a character is exposed to multiple doses of inhaled and ingested poisons simultaneously, only one save is made at the higher DC. If the save fails, the character is subject to all of the doses, but still only takes the effect once for the failed saving throw. If the save succeeds, the character avoids all of the doses. <br>
<b>7.</b> Finally, if the character is exposed to a poison that is similar, but not the same, such as having a slightly different frequency or DC, it is treated as a different affliction that is tracked separately, even if it has the same name or other identical entries.</p>

<p>So, keeping these rules in mind, let's take a look at a few scenarios using poison and how they are resolved. In all cases, the character is exposed to greenblood oil, an injury poison, with a DC of 13, a frequency of 1/round for 4 rounds, an effect of 1 Con damage, and a cure entry of 1 save.</p>

<p><b>Scenario A</b>: Valeros is hit by an arrow coated in greenblood oil. He fails the DC 13 Fort save and takes 1 point of Con damage. At the end of his turn, he fails a saving throw against the poison and takes 1 more point of Con damage. Before his second turn, he gets hit again and must attempt a DC 15 Fort save (because 1 dose is already affecting him). He fails this save as well, which deals another point of Con damage, increases the save DC he must make each round to 15, and extends the total duration by 2 rounds.</p>

<p><b>Scenario B</b>: Valeros is hit by a pair of arrows coated in greenblood oil, during the turn of one enemy archer. He fails the first DC 13 Fort save and takes 1 point of Con damage. He then must make a DC 15 Fort save for the second arrow. He makes this save and suffers no ill effect. On his turn, he must make a DC 13 For save (since only 1 dose of the poison is in effect). He makes this save and takes no damage, as the poison ends. If he is hit again on the next turn, his save would reset to DC 13.</p>

<p><b>Scenario C</b>: Valeros is hit by a pair of arrows coated in greenblood oil. He fails the DC 13 Fort save and takes 1 point of Con damage. He then must make a DC 15 Fort save for the second arrow. He fails this save and takes 1 point of Con damage. On his turn, he must make another DC 15 Fort save, which he fails, causing him to take yet another point of Con damage. On the next turn, the archer fires an arrow coated in special greenblood oil poison, with a DC of 20. It hits poor Valeros, who fails the save and now must track the two poisons separately (since they are not identical). To add to his misery, another arrow coated in ordinary greenblood oil poison hits him as well, forcing him to make a DC 17 Fortitude save, which he also fails, increasing the total duration to 8 rounds (1 of which has passed). Valeros is in trouble.</p>

<p>As you can see, poison is a deadly business. Monsters that can use injury poison, such as spiders and centipedes, should not be taken lightly. Best to stock up on a scroll or two of <i>neutralize poison</i>, or better yet, a wand.</p>

  ... The Future of Pathfinder Society Organized Play, Part I: PaizoCon and Beyond Monday, March 21, 2011 ... Though we're still in 2011's first quarter, we in Pathfinder Society Central are already plotting out details of Season 3, which will officially begin in August at Gen Con. Before we can move into the next season, however, we need to conclude Season 2. I guess now's as good a time as any to announce the final four scenarios of the current season&mdash;The Year of the Shadow Lodge. ......

<p>Though we're still in 2011's first quarter, we in Pathfinder Society Central are already plotting out details of Season 3, which will officially begin in August at Gen Con. Before we can move into the next season, however, we need to conclude Season 2. I guess now's as good a time as any to announce the final four scenarios of the current season&mdash;The Year of the Shadow Lodge.</p>

<p>At PaizoCon, as always, four new scenarios will debut to tie up all the loose ends with the ongoing metaplot of the season, and foreshadow the themes and challenges of next year. In this case, we've got the two part <i>Shadow's Last Stand</i> arc, set in the Andoren capital of Almas. Part I is <a href="/pathfinderSociety/scenarios/v5748btpy8jon"<i>At Shadow's Door</i></a>, by Steven Robert, and Part II is <a href="/pathfinderSociety/scenarios/v5748btpy8joo"><i>Web of Corruption</i></a> by Patrick Renie. Pathfinder Society campaign coordinator Hyrum Savage will send the PCs deep into undead-ruled Geb in <a href="/pathfinderSociety/scenarios/v5748btpy8jop"><i>You Only Die Twice</i></a>, and Michael Kortes will pit the PCs against a team of deadly assassins in <a href="/pathfinderSociety/scenarios/v5748btpy8joq"><i>The Mantis's Prey</i></a>. Players closely following the conflict between the Shadow Lodge and the Decemvirate will find all their questions answered in these four action- and intrigue-packed scenarios.</p>

<p>Because we've got some fairly significant changes and expansions coming to the campaign as it enters its fourth year, we decided to vary things up a little with July's releases. Instead of two standalone adventures left dangling between the conclusion of one year-long story arc and the introduction of another, we'll be putting out a three-part, first-level adventure arc called <i>First Steps</i>, designed to act as an introduction for new players, or old players starting new PCs. In this series, PCs will undertake their first missions as Pathfinders, learning what it means to be a member of the world-spanning organization, getting familiar with Absalom&mdash;their new home base&mdash;and meeting the heads of all the factions as well as some of the Society's most persistent enemies.</p>

<p>Adam Daigle starts it all off with <a href="/pathfinderSociety/scenarios/v5748btpy8jor"><i>In Service to Lore</i></a>, followed by Stephen Radney-MacFarland's <a href="/pathfinderSociety/scenarios/v5748btpy8jos"><i>To Delve the Dungeon Deep</i></a>. Larry Wilhelm wraps it all up with <a href="/pathfinderSociety/scenarios/v5748btpy8jot"><i>A Vision of Betrayal</i></a>. PCs will end the series at second level, and choose their faction at the series' conclusion, deciding which of the motivations or play-styles most fits their character. As if this weren't exciting enough, all three scenarios will be available for free.</p>

<p>Stay tuned to this blog for more announcements about the future of the Pathfinder Society Organized Play campaign in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>As you may recall, last month Pathfinder fiction author Kevin Andrew Murphy temporarily lost his mind and wrote us a full heroic crown of sonnets featuring 15 of our iconic characters, then sent it to us as a Valentine's Day present. We <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lbw6">posted it on the blog</a>, and folks seemed to enjoy it. Perhaps <i>too</i> much.</p> 

<p>Never one to back away from a challenge, Kevin has now written <i>another</i> poem dealing with the Pathfinder iconics and posted it on the messageboards, this time in honor of St. Patrick's Day. The poem&mdash;made up of linked limericks&mdash;is of a tradition known as "flyting," a very old practice in which two parties exchange over-the-top and often lewd insults in verse. (Think of it as a medieval rap battle.) In this case, the two competitors are Alain and Lem&mdash;apparently, nobody told the cavalier that it's unwise to take on a bard in an insult contest.</p>

<p>While things get a bit bawdier than we can post on the blog, those who don't mind a little crudity in their poetry may want to <a href="/paizo/messageboards/paizoPublishing/pathfinder/fiction/pathfinderPoetryTheFlytingOfCaileansHallLimerickEpicForStPatrickSDay2011MarkMoreland">head over to the thread</a> and read it for themselves. Having such a thriving fan fiction community is always fun and flattering, but this... well, this is definitely a new sort of animal!</p>

<p>Kudos to Kevin, and let us all hope they continue to offer internet access in his padded cell....</p>

<p>And just like that, <a href="/pathfinder/campaignSetting/v5748btpy8g77"><i>Undead Revisited</i></a> is shambling off to the printers! I previewed some of the art for this book a few weeks back, showing off how ten of the iconic heroes are doomed to meet grisly ends when this book hits store shelves. As with all books in the Revisited line, each chapter ends with a sample stat block&mdash;in the case of this book, a sample undead or new variant. Among those ten stat blocks we have a fallen Knight of Ozem and a fallen Hellknight, two undead dragons, a demonic mohrg and a daemonic devourer, a priestly lich and a kingly wight... and the following two critters from the entries on nightshades and the spectral dead&mdash;I'll let you all guess what exactly these are.</p>

<h1><br>Hunt the Space-Witch!</h1>
<p class=date>Wednesday, March 16, 2011</p>

<p>With Manly Wade Wellman's <a href="/planetStories/v5748btpy8ddl"><i>Battle in the Dawn: The Complete Hok the Mighty</i></a> now shipping from the Paizo warehouse, I'm happy to announce we've just wrapped up production on our next volume in the <a href="/planetstories"> Planet Stories</a> library, Robert Silverberg's <a href="/planetStories/v5748btpy8g3l"><i>Hunt the Space-Witch! Seven Adventures in Time and Space</i></a>. A collection of Silverberg's early science fiction, <i>Hunt the Space-Witch!</i> features seven novellas by one of the genres most important voices, all written in the adventurous style of the original <i>Planet Stories</i> pulp magazine.</p>

<p>We have some other exciting Silverberg projects lined up in the future&mdash;including a just-announced omnibus collection titled <a href="/planetStories/v5748btpy8jmr"><i>The Planet Killers</i></a>&mdash;so when we went looking for a cover, we decided we wanted to give a similar stylistic look to the books, one that conveyed the sort of retro-future of Silverberg's wonder-filled, pulp-era-inspired stories. So behold, Kieran Yanner's striking cover illustration for the first volume!</p>

<p>Robert Silverberg's <a href="/planetStories/v5748btpy8g3l"><i>Hunt the Space-Witch!</i></a> ships in June.</p>

<h1><br>Manipulating Terrain</h1>
<p class=date>Tuesday, March 15, 2011</p>

<p>For the last installment of the Design Tuesday blog on terrain, we are going to look at a relatively new type of terrain&mdash;terrain that you can actively manipulate. This kind of terrain can grant a creature a variety of effects, from an attack, to cover, to a special or enhanced mode of movement.</p>
<p>Some of the examples of this type of terrain will look familiar. Much of it can already be found within existing encounters. Where this is the case, it is up to you, the GM, to decide whether or not you wish to allow the special terrain effects described below.</p>
<p>Other samples of this type of terrain are new. Some, like the blink crystal, grant magical effects, and can add a sense of mystery and danger, as well as the possibility for strange tactics on the part of the PCs and their opponents.</p>
<p>Like the hazardous terrain presented last week, these new terrain types straddle the line between terrain and new dangers. Based on how much of this terrain you plan to use, you may want to consider adjusting the CR of encounters that use these more active forms of terrain, especially if their use grants one side of the combat more advantage than their foes.</p>

<p><b>Alchemical Devices</b>: This terrain is actually a broad class of similarly acting terrains. They can be as simple as a workbench cluttered with beakers filled with roiling concoctions, or as complex as a distiller or even stranger alchemical machines. Manipulating such devices requires a standard action and any number of skill checks. Toppling a table requires a Strength check. Making a distiller shoot a gout of highly-pressurized alchemical gas may require a Disable Device check, a Craft (alchemy) check, or even a Strength check, if the PCs are using a strategic application of brute force. Interacting with more complex machinery usually requires a Disable Device check, though a higher DC Craft (alchemy) or Knowledge (arcana) check may do in a pinch.</p>
<p>Whatever the type of alchemical device, the basic rules for its manipulation are as follows. A successful check made as a standard action creates a 15-foot cone (or alternatively a 20-foot line) of damaging energy, controlled by the creature that successfully manipulated the device. It deals damage to creatures within the area of effect. A Reflex or a Fortitude DC halves the damage. Often alchemical devices create an area of acid, but the destructive energy could be cold, electrical, fire, or in rare cases even sonic or force damage, depending on the nature of the device.</p>
<p>To add more flavor and danger to specific alchemical devices, you can layer on additional conditions and effects. You could add bleed damage (which works well for acid or even fire damage devices), have creatures knocked prone on a failed saving throw (for sonic or force damage devices), or have a failed saving throw entangle creatures for 1d4 rounds (for cold damage devices) or even daze creatures for 1 round (for electrical damage devices). <p>
<p>The following are some suggestions for baseline effects of alchemical devices based on the base CR of the encounter.</p>
<p><i>Simple Alchemical Device (CR 1&ndash;5)</i>: <i>Activating</i>&mdash;DC 14 check; <i>Effect</i>&mdash;DC 12 Reflex saving throw for 2d6 acid, fire, or electrical damage, or a DC 12 Fortitude saving throw if the device deals cold, sonic, or force damage.</p>
<p><i>Complicated Alchemical Device (CR 6&ndash;10)</i>: <i>Activating</i>&mdash;DC 17 check; <i>Effect</i>&mdash;DC 15 Reflex saving throw for 3d6 acid, fire, or electrical damage, or a DC 15 Fortitude saving throw if the device deals cold, sonic, or force damage.</p>
<p><i>Advanced Alchemical Device (CR 11&ndash;15)</i>: <i>Activating</i>&mdash;DC 22 check; <i>Effect</i>&mdash;DC 20 Reflex saving throw for 4d6 acid, fire, or electrical damage, or a DC 20 Fortitude saving throw if the device deals cold, sonic, or force damage.</p>
<p><i>Magic-Infused Alchemical Device (CR 16+)</i>: <i>Activating</i>&mdash;DC 27 check; <i>Effect</i>&mdash;DC 25 Reflex saving throw for 4d6 acid, fire, or electrical damage, or a DC 25 Fortitude saving throw if the device deals cold, sonic, or force damage.</p>

<p><b>Blink Crystal</b>: These strange, cloudy-white crystals glow with a faint purplish radiance. Typically blink crystals are the size of large gemstones, and they are always set in a statue or some similar large and immobile casing. If a blink crystal is removed from its casing, it loses its magic and becomes nothing more than a large piece of common quartz (worth 10 gp). A creature adjacent to a blink crystal can touch it as a free action, which causes the creature to teleport up to 20 feet to an unoccupied space on stable ground within line of sight. Touching a blink crystal as a swift action along with a successful DC 20 Spellcraft or Use Magical Device check can increase the range of the teleport to 40 feet. Failing this check allows the creature to teleport 20 feet.</p>

<p><b>Bubbling Caldron</b>: A size Large bubbling caldron can be tipped over with a DC 15 Strength check made as a standard action. Doing so releases a 30-foot cone of boiling liquid from the caldron in the direction of the creature’s choosing, and deals 2d6 fire damage to all creatures within the cone’s area. A successful DC 12 Reflex saving throw halves the damage.</p>
<p>The liquid makes the area of the cone slippery (<i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i> 412) until it dries or dissipates. The cone of liquid affects creatures on the ground only. Flying or levitating creatures can avoid the liquid and its damaging effect.</p>

<p><b>Chandelier</b>: Successfully leaping onto a chandelier allows a creature to hang from it and use its momentum to increase the power of a jump before the end of the leaping creature’s next turn. A creature is flat-footed while it hangs or balances on chandelier.</p>
<p>Using the momentum of the chandelier grants the leaping creature a +5 circumstance bonus on Acrobatic checks made to jump off the chandelier, and the jump is considered to have a running start for purposes of determining the DC of the check.</p>
<p>Chandeliers have size categories like creatures do. They are typically size Small or larger. A chandelier can easily support a single creature of its own size or smaller.</p>
<p>A creature larger than the chandelier’s size (or two creatures of the same size or smaller than the chandelier) can attempt to hang on it or use it to gain the bonus on Acrobatics checks made to jump, but at the end of the creature’s turn (or the second creature’s turn, if two creatures are using the chandelier for the same effect), the chandelier breaks free from its supports and both the chandelier and any creatures hanging from it fall to the ground. If either a creature two or more size categories larger than the chandelier or three smaller creatures leap on to the chandelier, the chandelier and those hanging on it fall immediately. Creatures take normal damage from the fall plus an additional 1d10 damage from the falling chandelier. At the GM’s discretion, extremely large or heavy chandeliers or chandeliers with sharp protrusions or other dangers can deal additional damage upon a fall.</p>

<p><b>Furniture</b>: From flipping over a table to using a gong as makeshift shield, a movable piece of furniture can be manipulated to create partial cover for a short period of time. A creature that is adjacent to the piece of movable furniture can attempt a Strength check as a move-equivalent action to gain cover from the item until the start of its next turn.</p>
<p>The DC of the Strength check depends on the size of the furniture. The base is DC 10 for size Small furniture, and the DC increases by 5 for each size category over Small (moving a Medium piece of furniture is DC 15, moving a Large piece of furniture is DC 20, and so on). A creature cannot attempt this manipulation if it is two or more size categories smaller than the piece of movable furniture it wants to manipulate.</p>

<p><b>Rug</b>: A creature can spend a standard action to attempt to pull a rug out from under creatures standing atop the rug. This requires a DC 15 or higher Strength check, depending on the size of the rug. If successful, each creature standing atop the rug (some of its space must be on atop the rug) must succeed on a DC 12 Reflex saving throw or fall prone. Creatures that cannot be tripped are immune to this effect. Rugs that are larger than a 4-square area require higher Strength checks. The DC increases by 2 for every additional 2 squares of rug area beyond 4 squares.</p>

<h1>Golarion Day: Report from Kintargo&mdash;Rival Guide</h1>
<p class=date>Thursday, March 10, 2011</p>

<p>It's been quite a few weeks since my last report. I've learned a lot since then... too much to reveal to you all in a single report, but I wanted to make sure those idiot Thrunies weren't on to me. Looks like I'm safe, though. I've kept an eye out for Thrune agents since my last report, but haven't seen or heard anything. Which means it's safe for me to start sending regular reports!</p>

<p>One thing I noticed in the vaults below Egorian was a sizable collection of intelligence on numerous adventuring groups active throughout the Inner Sea region. At first I thought this was just the Thrunies keeping track of potential enemies, but after sifting through the stacks, I realized it was quite the opposite. They've been watching a lot of cults, mercenary groups, and other troublemakers who they hope to ally with, perhaps to use as agents to send against their enemies. And since the enemy of Thrune is my friend, I figured that letting my friends know about enemies they don't know about yet would be a good thing. If that makes any sense.</p>

<p>Anyway, my point is that Thrune's collected quite a bit of information about these potential rivals, and I snatched dossiers for ten of them. I've sent them on to the Pathfinders, and they've promised to publish the information when they get a chance. They're thinking of calling it something like "A Comprehensive Guide to Rivals," despite the fact that I think the shorter "Rival Guide" is more to the point and doesn't imply that these are the only rivals we'll ever face. Just ten groups of them.</p>

<p>Of those ten groups, we've got a mercenary band from Brevoy more active these days in the River Kingdoms, a sadistic group of incredibly powerful adventurers, some elf-hating agents of the Aspis Consortium down Sargavawards, a bunch of crazy pirates led by some sort of haunted oracle, some foolhardy giant-hunters up in Varisia, a group of slavers led by a barbaric gnoll down around Katapesh, some freaky assassins or murderers up in Ustalav, and even the Queen's Hands&mdash;a group of relentless investigators who work for Queen Abrogail herself. (Fortunately, the Queen's Hands don't seem to get up to the north side here that often.) The Pathfinders were obviously most interested in some group based in Absalom&mdash;the Poisoned Lodge, or some such&mdash;a group of poisoners and drug dealers that have been annoying some of the Pathfinders of late. But to me, the most interesting group was probably the Dust Coven&mdash;a group of exiled drow worshipers of the demon lord Shax who have been cutting a murder-swath through the Inner Sea of late. Their leader is a witch (who seems to have been reincarnated from a drow into an annis hag, if the rumors are to be believed) who specializes in all sorts of magical dusts and powders—I'm including descriptions of two of these in this report. They'll be in the "Rival Guide" or whatever that book ends up being called, along with lots of other information about these groups and the specialized magic, spells, and tools they use. I'm also including an illustration of the Dust Coven's sign&mdash;the rune of Shak gripped in a creepy-looking hand. (Someone could do with a manicure.)</p>

<p>In any case, make sure to check the book out when you see it, but if you're reading it where the Thrunies might see you... take care. They'll probably get pretty angry once they see the book on store shelves.</p>

<h1>Who Ya Gonna Call?</h1>
<p class=date>Wednesday, March 9, 2011</p>

<p>With the Carrion Crown Adventure Path finally unleashed, this seems like a perfect time to give folks bold enough to venture into Pathfinder's most frightening campaign just a hint of what's in store.</p>

<p>To start off, let's take a look at the volume that kick-starts the terror: <a href="/pathfinderAdventurePath/carrionCrown/v5748btpy8ihy"><i>Pathfinder Adventure Path</i> #43: The Haunting of Harrowstone</a>. Of course, you have Mike Kortes's foray into dread with the adventure itself, wherein the PCs are all that prevent a spectral prison riot from spilling out from the fire-scarred ruins of Harrowstone Prison and overwhelming the sleepy Ustalavic village of Ravengro.</p>

<p>Beyond the adventure, Kortes takes us onto the shadowed streets and into the clustered homes of Ravengro, as peaceful and quiet a community as you're likely to find in the Ustalavic county of Canterwall's rural countryside (which you learn all the secrets of in <a href="/pathfinderCampaignSetting/v5748btpy8g75"><i>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Rule of Fear</i></a>). This gazetteer gives GMs everything they'll need to bring the adventure's setting to life, with all the details and insights necessary to bring dread into the homes and hearts of the PCs and their newest allies.</p>

<p>Next up is Brandon Hodge's treatise on the horrifying traps-meet-the-supernatural threats known as haunts. Originally introduced all the way back in <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/riseOfTheRunelords/v5748btpy8029"><i>Pathfinder Adventure Path</i> #2: The Skinsaw Murders</a> and refined in the <a href="/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8ffn"><i>GameMastery Guide</i></a>, this has been our first opportunity to give sadistic GMs a whole library of some of fiction's and film's most horrifying unnatural effects. Fact is, Brandon gave us WAY more menace than a single article could contain... but I'll get back to that in a few.</p>

<p>In a new series in the Pathfinder's Journal I get to explore my favorite corner of Golarion from a different vantage. This time around, Laurel Cylphra, a wastrel on the streets of Ustalav's decomposing former capital, gets dragged into a tale of revenge, wronged spirits, and terrors that could drive even a Pathfinder into retirement.</p>

<p>Finally, Adam Daigle and intern-turned-author Patrick Renie unleash denizens of dread with the first in a horrific series of Pathfinder Bestiaries, with creatures of classic terror like Spring-Heeled Jack, old monsters given terrifying twists, new rules for haunted animated objects, an option for accursed characters with the changeling, and others like the beheaded and ectoplasmic templates that still leave me with a sinister smirk&mdash;I can't wait to use some of these guys!</p>

<p>So, that's what's in store if you haven't already checked out <a href="/pathfinderAdventurePath/carrionCrown/v5748btpy8ihy"><i>Pathfinder Adventure Path</i> #43: The Haunting of Harrowstone</a>. Now, for those of you who were patient enough to stick with me this far, check out what's below. Like I said, Brandon's article on haunts ran over the space we had allotted for it, but rather than trash that awesome content, I've kept it safe and plan to dole out new haunts as each volume of the Carrion Crown releases. So, for those of you looking for more menace to throw into Harrowstone, here are a couple of new low-level haunts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Fool's Flare (CR 2)</b><br>
Many spirits resent the intrusion of lights brought by the living into their dark domains, and exert a supernatural influence on torches and lanterns to show their objections to the trespass of torchbearers.</p>

<p><b>Fool's Flare CR 2<br>
XP 600</b><br>
CE haunt (10-ft. radius)<br>
<b>Caster Level</b> 2nd<br>
<b>Notice</b> Perception DC 15 (to feel a cold, unearthly draft)<br>
<b>hp</b> 4; <b>Trigger</b> proximity; <b>Reset</b> 1 day<br>
<b>Effect</b> This haunt triggers a <i>pyrotechnics</i> spell on torches or lanterns brought into its area. In some instances, torches flare brightly with a blinding light before plunging the area into darkness, as per the fireworks effect, but in others the light sputters and dies, the extinguished source giving off a smoke cloud effect (save DC 13 versus secondary effects).<br>
<b>Destruction</b> A <i>daylight</i> spell cast in the area permanently drives out the haunt.</p>

<p><b>Rolling Fire (CR 4)</b><br>
Also known as a faeu boulanger, rolling fire is a trapped soul that was lost in a tragic fire fatality. The haunt manifests as a spectral sphere of ectoplasmic fire that seeks to scorch and burn the living in a grisly reenactment of the conflagration that created it.</p>

<b>Rolling Fire CR 4</b><br>
<b>XP 1,200</b><br>
CE persistent haunt (30-ft.-radius open area or marshland)<br>
<b>Caster Level</b> 4th<br>
<b>Notice</b> Perception DC 15 (to smell burning flesh)<br>
<b>hp</b> 18; <b>Trigger</b> proximity; <b>Reset</b> 1 day<br>
<b>Effect</b> The haunt appears as a large ball of spiritual flame emitting agonizing screams. The haunt attacks the first creature that enters its area as a <i>flaming sphere</i> spell (save DC 13).<br>
<b>Destruction</b> Turning one's coat inside out confuses the faeu boulanger and prevents attack. A knife must then be stuck blade-up in the ground of the haunt's area; when the roaming spectre rolls over the blade, it impales itself and is destroyed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Watch this spot in the coming weeks for more haunts and other Carrion Crown previews. But if you're still craving more info on the new campaign, be sure to check out the free <a href="/pathfinderAdventurePath/carrionCrown/v5748btpy8j0q"><i>Carrion Crown Player's Guide</i></a> and the discussions constantly going on in the <a href="/paizo/messageboards/paizoPublishing/pathfinder/adventurePath/carrionCrown">Carrion Crown Messageboards</a>.  There's already a ton of great stuff in those threads for folks who want to make this campaign as horrifying as possible, and for those less interested in turning up the terror in their adventures. But you won't know until you take the first step, so knot up your courage and click any of the links above to learn all about our newest terror... if you dare.</p>

<h1><br>Hazardous Terrain</h1>
<p class=date>Tuesday, March 8, 2011</p>

<p>In last week's Design Tuesday blog, I delved into the importance of terrain to push your encounter design to the next level, and provided you with some design philosophy to ponder when designing your own terrain. This week, I'm back with some concrete examples.</p>

<p>The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game assumes combatants are able to use their movement abilities with little or no hindrance. Sure, there are walls, doors, and difficult terrain to navigate, or maybe some obscuring effects to grant a little concealment, but for the most part PCs and monsters have free reign to move about the rooms and corridors of the dungeon as they wish. The following types of terrain are all exceptions to this norm. While some act as difficult terrain, they present further hazards while navigating the battlefield.<p>

<p>One thing to keep in mind about all of these new terrain types is that they typically work best as smaller, tactically placed patches. You may be tempted to fill an entire battlefield with one of these new terrains, but doing this should be the exception rather than the rule. They all work best when they give characters a choice between freedom and danger. When properly placed, they can reward the use of combat maneuvers and spells that grant increased mobility to allies or restrict or force the movement of enemies, and may limit the opportunities to make charge attacks without stymieing that tactic outright.<p>

<p> You may notice that these new terrain types are very similar to the hazards presented on pages 244&ndash;245 of the <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8ffn"><i>Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide</i></a>. So what is the difference between these terrains and hazards? These hazardous terrains involve slightly more choice on the part of combatant than hazards do. Most, if not all, have effects when a character chooses to move into or is forced into them, and those effects should be relatively easy to determine before the combatant enters them, either by way of their physical characteristic or an easy Knowledge check (DC 10) of the appropriate type.<p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Anchor Stone</b>: This strange stone has a debilitating gravitational effect on those who do not traverse over it quickly. Each time a creature starts its turn on an area of anchor stone, it must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude saving throw. Any creature that fails can only take a 5-foot step on its turn. Any creature that succeeds at the saving throw must move at half speed on its turn.<p>

<p>To take the effects of anchor stone, a creature must be standing on or touching the stone. Anchor stone has no effect on those who fly over it or otherwise do not have physical contact with the stone.<p>

<p>Some areas of anchor stone are more powerful than others, having a DC of 15, 20, or even higher.<p>

<p><b>Choke Spores</b>: This type of fungus thrives in subterranean caves and other damp and lightless areas. The first time a creature starts its turn within an area containing choke spores, the poison of the fungus is released, inflicting those within that space with the following poison.<p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Choke Spore Poison</b></p>
<p><b>Type</b> poison, inhaled; <b>Save</b> Fortitude DC 14</p>
<P><b>Frequency</b> 1/round for 1d4 rounds</P>
</P><b>Effect</b> 1 Dex and 1 Wis damage; <b>Cure</b> 1 save<p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once an area of choke spores releases its poison, that area becomes dormant for 1 day. With a single standard action, a creature can use fire (from a torch, a <i>flaming</i> magical weapon, or a similar implement) to destroy all the choke spore balls within all 5-foot-squares adjacent to the creature. Acid, cold, and fire damage from area effect spells automatically destroy patches of choke spores within the spells' effect areas.<p>

<p><b>Fey Mist</b>: This strange swirling mist of purple and green gas and motes of light dazzles those who stray within it. Fey mist provides concealment. Furthermore, a living, non-fey creature that starts its turn within the mist must make a DC 12 Will saving throw or become confused for 1 round. Those that make their saving throws are dazzled for 1 round instead. This is an enchantment effect.<p>

<p> Some areas of fey mist are more powerful than others, and have and require a DC 15, DC 20, or even DC 25 Will saving throw to avoid its confusion.<p>

<p><b>Flame</b>: A house is on fire and that flame rages in large areas, a hellish landscape burns around you, or a large bonfire rages in a clearing where a coven of witches chant evil incantations. While the <i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i> has rules for forest fires, sometimes you may want to have a section of an encounter area that just burns.<p>
<p> When a creature starts its turn with its space fully within an area of flame, it takes 1d6 points of fire damage, and if the creature is wearing metal armor, it is affected as if by a <i>heat metal</i>  spell. A creature that starts its turn with its space only partially within an area of flame must succeed at a DC 12 Reflex saving throw or take the damage and the <i>heat metal</i> effect if it is wearing metal armor. A creature that moves through areas of flame must make a DC 12 Reflex saving throw or take 1d6 points of fire damage, but avoids the <i>heat metal</i> effect. This save is made the first time a creature moves into flame with a move action or when it is affected by something that pushes or otherwise forces the creature into an area of flame. <p>
<p> Supernatural or powerful flames can have higher DCs. A raging fire can have a DC of 15 or the fires of Hell can have a DC of 20, 25, or 30 depending on the power of the flames.<p>
<p> Areas of flame often create smoke, the effects of which can be found on page 444 of the <i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i>.<p>

<p><b>Haunted Ground</b>: These areas of accursed ground are often the sites of horrid crimes or intense and bloody battles. The intense fear of those who lost their lives lingers and saturates the area. This fear affects living creatures that stray within these areas. A living creature that starts its turn in an area of haunted ground must succeed at a DC 15 Will saving throw or become shaken for 1d4 rounds. If the creature is already shaken, it becomes frightened for the same duration instead. Frightened creatures become panicked for the same duration instead. Creatures that are immune to fear effects are immune to haunted ground. <p>

<p><b>Razor Rubble</b>: Either rubble made of sharp stone, or laced with small sharp blades, this terrain functions like difficult terrain (see <i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i>193), but each square a creature enters deals 1 point of damage to that creature. A creature moving at half speed, or that succeeds at a DC 15 Acrobatics check as a free action when first moving into an area of razor rubble can avoid the damaging affects for the round but not the difficult terrain effect.<p>

<p><b>Slick Ice</b>: A frozen lake, a sheen of thick ice on a dungeon or cavern floor, or some other cold and slick surface, slick ice can be hard to traverse, but can also increase the speed of creatures that are agile or foolhardy enough to utilize its surface's lack of friction.<p>
<p>A creature traversing slick ice at more than half speed is required to make a DC 15 Acrobatic check at the start of the movement. Failure causes the creature to fall prone at the start of the movement. Running or charging on slick ice increases the DC by 5, with the same effect on a failed skill check. A creature that succeeds at this check by 5 or more can increase its move across the ice by 10 feet, but is considered flat-footed until the start of its next turn. Creatures (like those with enough levels of barbarian or rogue) that can't be caught flat-footed at the start of combat are immune to this flat-footed effect as well.<p>
<p><b>Tentacle Mold</b>: This strange vermillion fungus clings to the moist walls, floors, and even ceilings of dungeons and caverns. When a living creature is in or near a patch of this fungus, acidic pseudopods lash out, with sickening effect.<p>

<p>When a living creature starts it turn in an area of or in a square next to (if it clings to the walls or the ceiling) of tentacle mold, it must make a DC 15 Fortitude saving throw; on a failed saving throw the creature takes 1 acid damage and is sickened for 1 round. Though the effect is like a poison, this is not actually a poison effect; the strange chemistry of this kind of mold makes it more alchemical in nature.<p>

<h1>Gunslinger Reloaded</h1>
<p class=date>Monday, March 7, 2011</p>

<p>Are you ready for some more fun with fantasy firearms? Well, ready or not, we are unleashing the second round of the <a href="/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8ies"><i>Ultimate Combat</i></a> playtest! In <a href="/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8j5e">this round</a>, we're bringing you the updated version of the gunslinger&mdash;a full 1&ndash;20 class in its own right, unhinged from the fighter class.<p>

<p>This <a href="/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8j5e">new version</a> of the gunslinger has more deeds, many of the older deeds have been reshuffled and repriced, and we are providing you with more guns to play with&mdash;including advanced firearms for those of you who want to go whole hog into the era where guns dominate the battlefield.<p>

<p>Not only will you get the updated crunchy bits you crave for playtesting, we also have a sidebar to help GMs determine what role (if any) firearms have in their campaign. This sidebar also talks about how firearm and gunslinger rules change with the level of firearms you have in your campaign.<p>

<p> So photocopy some character sheets, grab your dice, load up that pepperbox with alchemical cartridges, and playtest away. We will be listening to your observations and results on the <a href="/paizo/messageboards/paizoPublishing/pathfinder/pathfinderRPG/ultimateCombatPlaytest/">messageboards</a>. Oh, and just in case you are wondering, the new version of the class is Pathfinder Society legal, so if you haven't done so already, find you local group, and start playing!<p>

<p style="clear:both;">Stephen Radney-MacFarland 
<br>Pathfinder RPG Designer</p>

<h1><br>Bark at the Moon!</h1>
<p class=date>Friday, March 4, 2011</p>

<p> Last week we showcased the cover art from Howard Andrew Jones' Pathfinder Tales novel <a href="m/pathfinder/tales/v5748btpy8iqp"><i>Plague of Shadows</i></a>. This week we go back to the beginning and give you a wallpaper based on <a href="/pathfinder/tales/v5748btpy8g3n"><i>Prince of Wolves</i></a>  by Dave Gross, the novel that launched the entire line. If you haven't read it yet you really should. It's got fighting, murder, mystery, true love, werewolves, ancient magics, curses from beyond the grave, and even dead Pathfinders! Best of all, if you know any Pathfinder Tales subscribers, they may have received a free copy to give away...</p>

<p>And tune into this spot on Monday as Pathfinder Designer Stephen Radney-MacFarland guest-blogs and things get... explosive.</p>

<p>It's time to begin another story on Paizo's <a href="/pathfinder/tales/serial"> free web fiction Wednesday</a>, and this time we have something new and different for you! In celebration of the release of <a href="/store/v5748btpy8iqp"><i>Plague of Shadows</i></a>, the new <a href="/pathfinderTales">Pathfinder Tales</a> novel, we've brought you a <a href="/pathfinder/tales/serial">brand-new prequel story</a> from <a href="/store/v5748btpy8iqp"><i>Plague of Shadows</i></a> author Howard Andrew Jones, featuring a number of the same characters but taking place well before the novel. Once again (or rather, once before) the Forlorn elf Elyana and her friends will encounter the evil of the Gray Gardeners in Galt&mdash;but this time there are the dark depths of the Verduran Forest to contend with as well. It's a pleasure to get to see characters from the novels in the web fiction, and we hope to do so each time a new novel releases&mdash;as well as sometimes just for fun.</p>

<p>As an author, Howard has knocked it out of the park. Early comments on <a href="/store/v5748btpy8iqp"><i>Plague of Shadows</i></a> have been extremely positive, and it's easy to see why. Perhaps it's the smooth speed with which he handles the fight scenes (and there are plenty), or the fast-paced sword and sorcery flavor (which is hardly surprising, given his status as Managing Editor of modern pulp magazine <i>Black Gate</i>). Yet even more than that, I think it's the classic feel of his stories that draw people in. Of all the novels we've published so far, <a href="/store/v5748btpy8iqp"><i>Plague of Shadows</i></a> is the one that most closely hews to the time-tested adventuring party dynamic. There's Elyana, the Forlorn elven ranger who knows her love for any human can never last; Drelm the honorable half-orc, struggling against his heritage; Vallyn the bard; Kellius the wizard&mdash;these are characters that feel familiar, even as they feel new.</p>

<p>And that's just the main party. Set many years earlier than the novel, this new story, "The Walkers from the Crypt," introduces us to the party that came before, and to the tensions that laid the novel's groundwork. But I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll stop there, and just say that it's a lot of fun.</p>

<p>I would also be remiss if I didn't note artist Eric Belisle's amazing illustration of Elyana, who also features on the cover of <i>Plague of Shadows</i>. Eric's perfectly captured the look and feel of an elven ranger from Golarion, and I hope you'll agree that the character in both the story and the novel are every bit as compelling as the illustration.</p>

<p>Having designed new magic items, archetypes, villains, and encounters, the Top 4 will now be required to write a full adventure module proposal for an installment of Paizo’s award-winning Pathfinder Modules line of “one shot” adventure modules. Paizo’s Creative Director James Jacobs will join the celebrity judges to comment on the four submissions, and the 80,000+ users of paizo.com will vote on their favorites. The proposal with the highest number of votes will be published by Paizo as a 32-page Pathfinder Module in early 2012, while the other three will be contracted to write a Pathfinder Society Scenario for Paizo's world-wide organized play campaign. Previous RPG Superstar-winning modules include 2011's <a href="/pathfinderModules/v5748btpy8ihu">Cult of the Ebon Destroyers</a> by Matt Goodall and 2010’s <a href="/pathfinderModules/v5748btpy8d52">Realm of the Fellnight Queen</a>, by Neil Spicer.</p>

<p>Contestants must submit their 3000-word Pathfinder Module proposal to Paizo by 2:00 PM Pacific time on Friday, March 11, 2010. On March 15, the entries and judge comments will be revealed to the general public, who will then get to discuss the entries and vote for their favorites. Voting ends on March 21, and the 2011 RPG Superstar and his winning Pathfinder Module proposal will be announced on March 23, with the winning module to be published in early 2012.</p>

<h1>Design Tuesday: Fun with Terrain</h1>
<p class=date>Tuesday, March 1, 2011</p>

<p>When designing an encounter, it's tempting to focus the majority of your attention on the mix of monsters and villains. After all, coming up with interesting enemy synergies and evocative scenes of terror, threat, and evil-doing go a long way in making encounters both memorable and fun. Often neglected, though, is making sure that the setting you place these bad guys in offers both threat and opportunity of its own. When designed correctly, the terrain of an encounter can provide opportunity and challenges that not only compliment the opponents that you select, but can make combat the stuff of gaming stories for years to come.<p>

<h2>First Things First</h2>
<p>There are two ways to go about terrain selection for your encounter. The first is to think about the environment that you want to set your encounters, or an entire adventure, within, and filling it with the proper terrain. When it comes to dungeon and cavern settings, much of this work is already done for you. Take a look at Chapter 13 of the <i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i>, especially pages 410&ndash416, and you'll find a good selection of terrain types to stock your dungeon. You'll also want to check out pages 193&mdash;194 of the <i>Core Rulebook</i> as it has the rules for difficult terrain and obstacles, and maybe take a peek at pages 244&ndash;245 <i>Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide</i> for some sample hazards to play with.<p>

<p>Picking proper terrain is all about creating interesting exceptions, so the first thing you'll want to do is make decisions about the baseline terrain for your dungeon. Unless your group is full of seasoned Pathfinder veterans, you'll want to set those baselines at or near the base assumptions of the Pathfinder rules: Masonry walls, flagstone, and wooden doors are a good start. For the most part you, and your players will not have to think about these areas of terrain at all. They're the standard dungeon dressing everyone is use to. Then you'll want to think about the possible exceptions for your dungeon. Are parts of the dungeon in disrepair? Are parts of the dungeon in the midst of construction? Does the dungeon serve as an entryway to a subterranean cave system? Does it lead to an underground river or water or magma? Once you are done imagining your dungeon, and maybe even sketching it on some graph paper, you can start to figure out where the exceptions sit, and then start brainstorming possibilities that you can't find in the rules... but we will get to that later.<p>

<p> Straying deeper into Chapter 13, you can make similar choices for large areas of terrain that are not dungeons, but the principles are the same. Find your baseline, and then ponder the possibility of interesting and evocative exceptions to that baseline. Take some notes, ponder some possibilities, and search the rules for similar types of terrain.</p>
 
<p>The other way to go about creating interesting environments is to think about the monsters and villains you want in your encounter in the adventure, and ask yourself two questions. The first question is, what kind of terrain compliments the monsters' or villains' tactics? The second question is, what kind of terrain compliments your PCs' abilities? Answering the second question can be a little tricky, especially if your end result is being designed for a nonspecific group of PCs (say you're writing an adventure for a convention or Pathfinder Society open call, or you're already thinking about next year's RPG Superstar). More often than not, you'll want to try to fill your encounters with terrain that does both simultaneously. This creates better-balanced encounters that don't favor one side or the other overly much, which not only tend to create more exciting encounters, but can also bypass the need to adjust the CR of your encounters because terrain favors one side more than the other.<p>

<p> Whenever possible, it's best to use a mixture of these two approaches. Treat each one as lenses toward your ultimate goal&mdash;to create a fun game experience in a world that seem rich, vibrant, and full of possibilities and potential dangers for the PCs to explore.<p>

<h2>Designing New Terrain</h2>
<p>Whenever you get the itch to create a new piece of terrain, you should shoot toward making your terrain challenging to interact with but not overly frustrating. In general, you will want one of two speeds for your new terrain. The first speed is terrain that has automatic effects when a creature spends an action to interact with it, but the effect is always constant. Unlocked doors, stairs, and small passageways all fall under this category. They talk directly to the action economy of the game. Someone must spend an action or slightly modify her normal actions in order to use them (think squeezing, opening doors, or basic difficult terrain). This type of terrain is easy to use, quick to remember, but it lacks variability. Some of the most exciting terrain features effects that do not guarantee success, or, better yet, feature varying degrees of success.<p>

<p>Enter the second speed of terrain, where actions are often required, but the effect is variable. Usually such variability is tied to the uses of a skill. For most terrain you will want to pick a basic skill that can be used untrained and that makes sense for the terrain type. Acrobatics, Climb, Escape Artist, Fly, Survival, Swim, and even raw Strength checks are some obvious examples, with Acrobatics already doing a lot of the heavy lifting with the terrain found in the <i>Core Rulebook</i> (see hewn stone floors, rubble, and slippery floors). But don't be afraid to mix it up a little with other skills, even those that can't be used untrained (Disable Device, Ride, and even Stealth are some personal favorites). Creating such terrain is just another way where PCs (or monsters) with high skill bonuses have an opportunity to shine, but at a cost. Failure is a possibility.<p>

<p>When creating new terrain, it is not only important to make sure that they work within the normal rules of the Pathfinder RPG but that they are also the right fit for the PC and creature mix you are designing encounters and adventure for. Designing a fight on a frozen lake may seem like fun, but the last thing you want to do is slow down the encounter to a crawl with every creature being forced to make an Acrobatics check in order to accomplish any kind of movement whatsoever. Consider creating relatively safe areas (maybe areas covered with snow or rough ice that grants more traction), giving clumsy creatures slightly suboptimal movement choices, while allowing agile creatures to gamble for success, or even the possibility of greater effect. With those sheets of ice, consider giving them the possibility of bonuses when higher Acrobatics checks are rolled.<p>

<h2>Can We Get Some Examples?</h2>
<p> With some of terrain philosophy out of the way, start fooling around with creating your own terrain. Tune in next Tuesday for some new pre-made terrain objects to spice up your game. Next week we will be focusing on some terrain primarily designed to limit or focus movement and action types, and the week after we will unleash some crazy terrain options that grant new action options, such as movement and even some terrain that grants creatures special attacks.<p>
