  description\"><a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lg6r\">Two weeks ago</a>, we briefly\
  \ discussed the impact of faction PCs' decisions in the campaign and how these decisions\
  \ have shaped the direction that these factions are going. Last week on the <a href=\"\
  http://35privatesanctuary.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;id=35&amp;Itemid=34\"\
  >Know Direction podcast</a>, John Compton expanded on what this evolution might\
  \ entail for many factions: name changes, shifting goals, and even changes in leadership.</span></p>\
  \ \n     <p>As advertised over a year ago, the so-called nation-based factions have\
  \ spent the past season (or longer for some like the Cheliax faction) distancing\
  \ themselves from their parent countries to embrace less territorial and more broadly\
  \ philosophical endeavors. When the Pathfinder Society Organized Play leaders began\
  \ discussing how factions would change, we looked at the reporting numbers contributed\
  \ by players worldwide and carefully considered how the faction might change to\
  \ reflect this information while still appealing to a large percentage of its members.\
  \ For example, members of the Silver Crusade faction tend to be good guys, so changing\
  \ that faction to be neutrally aligned would discourage a lot of players.</p> \n\
  \     <p>This week we're sharing the direction that two of our factions are heading\
  \ (new faction symbols will come a bit later). Be warned that there are some minor\
  \ spoilers from Season 5 scenarios referenced below.</p> \n     <h2>Dark Archive:\
  \ In Darkness Lies Enlightenment</h2> \n     <p>It's been more than a year since\
  \ Chelish officials condemned faction leader Paracountess Zarta Dralneen on false\
  \ charges. Because the accusation and punishment were largely off the record, there\
  \ was little context for Cheliax to apologize, formally withdraw the charges, or\
  \ invite Zarta to resume her duties as a liaison to the Pathfinder Society. Even\
  \ Zarta's agents have not escaped blame entirely. It's a bitter reminder that the\
  \ servants of Hell are hardly forgiving.</p> \n     <p>Since then, Zarta has worked\
  \ from Korvosa to consolidate what remained of her faction, and to her surprise,\
  \ the Pathfinder Society has extended a hand to help on multiple occasions. As a\
  \ result, Zarta finds her professional relationship with the Society has grown stronger.\
  \ As her agents stay busy recovering powerful artifacts and tomes that they might\
  \ use to track down the faction's enemies and defend themselves against future betrayals,\
  \ Zarta has corresponded with the Society's leaders to carve out a niche for her\
  \ organization.</p> \n     <p>What resulted is a major victory for the faction,\
  \ for Zarta has convinced the three Masters that she and her agents are uniquely\
  \ suited to handle dangerous relics. Not only does this cover for the evil artifacts\
  \ that the faction has recovered, but it has also earned an invitation to begin\
  \ cataloguing the vast array of perilous finds the Society has acquired and then\
  \ promptly hidden away for later study. Zarta intends to accept the offer and found\
  \ a dark archive, giving her faction access to untold numbers of forbidden texts\
  \ and relics—purportedly to catalogue and better understand these objects, but also\
  \ as a backdoor for her agents to gain power from sinister sources.</p> \n     <p>How\
  \ will the Cheliax faction be different? Despite being estranged from Cheliax, the\
  \ faction still values order and law. These are worthy end goals in their own right,\
  \ and they are also potent mantras in maintaining a positive working relationship\
  \ with the Pathfinder Society. Any betrayal of that trust must be a calculated one.\
  \ In many ways, the new Dark Archive faction is still the “bad guy” option that\
  \ the Cheliax faction has always been, but its reason for being welcome in the Society\
  \ is stronger.</p> \n     <h2>Liberty's Edge: In Pursuit of True Liberty</h2> \n\
  \     <p>Almost a year ago, Major Colson Maldris learned of a thriving contingent\
  \ of statesmen—many who had held noble titles before the People's Revolt—who had\
  \ established themselves as the new nobility of Andoran. Of course, these career\
  \ politicians were not embracing this lifestyle publically; doing so would invite\
  \ criminal charges. Instead they have built up networks of political and economic\
  \ power that keep them perpetually elected to office, in control of major industries,\
  \ in a position to shape a new generation of leaders through favors and cronyism.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>These corrupt leaders represent only a small fraction of Andoran's elected\
  \ leaders, and much of the nation still operates in a manner true to its founding\
  \ principles. Nonetheless, it is a chilling reminder that the great democratic experiment\
  \ is not without its flaws. With the help of Pathfinder agents, Maldris has tracked\
  \ down enough evidence to accuse a few criminals in high places, but his attempts\
  \ to demonstrate how deep the corruption runs has met with pushback from both the\
  \ crooked and the honest. So long as his faction operates as a direct extension\
  \ of Andoran, the faux-nobility can track Maldris's attempts to root them out. The\
  \ only way to save Andoran is to leave Andoran—at least for now.</p> \n     <p>What\
  \ does this mean for Andoran going forward? Well, in some ways little has changed.\
  \ For example, Maldris still seeks to help other throw off the shackles of tyranny\
  \ and bring freedom to all people. Now, though, the faction's reason for doing this\
  \ has expanded beyond altruism. In studying others' philosophies and techniques,\
  \ faction PCs can borrow strategies that might help Maldris hunt corruption at home\
  \ and abroad.</p> \n     <p>Happy gaming,</p> \n     <p>John Compton and Mike Brock<br>\
