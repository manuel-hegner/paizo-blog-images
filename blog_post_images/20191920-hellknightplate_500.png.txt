| summary  = Hellknight Plate, Item 2. Uncommon, Bulwark. Price 35 gp; Usage worn armor; Bulk 4; AC Bonus +6; Dex Cap +0; Check Penalty –3; Speed Penalty –10 feet; Strength 18; Type Heavy; Group Plate. Few armors in the entire Inner Sea region are as memorable as the iconic Hellknight plate. While each order has their own flourishes, Hellknight plate is instantly recognizable to any who know of the Hellknights. Hellknights go to extreme measures to punish non-Hellknights who get their hands on Hellknight plate, and the reward is not usually worth the risk, as the armor is functionally similar to full plate.
