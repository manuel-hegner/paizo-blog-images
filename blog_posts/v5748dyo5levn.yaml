  \ month, we’ll be releasing <a href=\"/products/btpy8yw6\"><i>Pathfinder Player\
  \ Companion: Pathfinder Society Primer</i></a>, a 32-page player-focused sourcebook\
  \ specifically designed for use in the Pathfinder Society Organized Play campaign.\
  \ Written by John Compton and myself, the book should provide characters of all\
  \ sorts with new options to use both in the organized play environment and in society-themed\
  \ home campaigns.</span></p> \n     <p>Among the many new rules presented in the\
  \ book are a series of feats designed to accentuate the difference between Pathfinder\
  \ agents commissioned from the field after proving themselves as able adventurers\
  \ and those initiates who receive training at the Grand Lodge before earning their\
  \ <i>wayfinders</i>. While none of these feats has the prerequisite of either character\
  \ background, those for field commissioned Pathfinders tend to focus on luck and\
  \ spontaneity, while those for trained Pathfinders benefit characters whose abilities\
  \ are based on study and extensive training.</p> \n     <p>Here are two sample feats\
  \ from this section of the book.</p> \n     <h2>Patient Strike (Combat)</h2> \n\
  \     <p>Your training under the Master of Swords has taught you that a well-timed\
  \ strike is worth waiting for and that patience will serve you well in the long\
  \ run.<br> <b>Prerequisite</b>: Int 13.<br> <b>Benefit</b>: You can choose to ready\
  \ an attack as a full-round action instead of a standard action. When you do so,\
  \ you gain a +2 bonus on your attack roll when your readied action triggers.<br>\
  \ <b>Normal</b>: Readying an attack is a standard action and doesn’t grant a bonus\
  \ on your attack roll.</p> \n     <h2>Versatile Spontaneity</h2> \n     <p>You made\
  \ a good name for yourself in the Pathfinder Society in part because you knew how\
  \ to prepare for the challenges before you, even if your natural magical abilities\
  \ lend themselves less to preparation and more to spontaneity.<br> <b>Prerequisites</b>:\
  \ Int 13 or Wis 13 (see Special), ability to spontaneously cast 2nd-level spells.<br>\
  \ <b>Benefit</b>: When you regain spell slots at the start of the day, you may opt\
  \ to prepare one spell you don’t know in place of a daily spell slot 1 level higher\
  \ than the prepared spell’s level. To do so, you must have access to the selected\
  \ spell on a scroll or in a spellbook, and the spell must be on your spell list\
  \ (even if it is not one of your spells known). This process takes 10 minutes per\
  \ spell level of the selected spell. You can cast the selected spell a single time,\
  \ expending the spell slot as though it were a known spell being cast by you. Preparing\
  \ a spell in this manner expends a scroll but not a spellbook. A spell prepared\
  \ in this way is considered its actual level rather than the level of the spell\
  \ slot expended. You can apply metamagic feats to the spell as normal, as long as\
  \ the spell’s actual level plus the increases from metamagic feats is 1 level lower\
  \ than the highest-level spell you can cast. For example, a 12th-level sorcerer\
  \ with this feat, a scroll of <i>fireball</i>, and the Empower Spell metamagic feat\
  \ could prepare an empowered <i>fireball</i> spell in her 6th-level spell slot.<br>\
  \ <b>Special</b>: If you spontaneously cast arcane spells, you must have an Intelligence\
  \ score of at least 13 to take this feat. If you spontaneously cast divine spells,\
  \ you must have a Wisdom score of at least 13 to take this feat. If you have both\
  \ arcane and divine spellcasting classes, you can use this feat to prepare a spell\
  \ using a given class’s spell slot as long as you meet the associated ability score\
  \ prerequisite.</p> \n     <p><a href=\"/products/btpy8yw6\"><i>Pathfinder Player\
  \ Companion: Pathfinder Society Primer</i></a> is set for a July release, so preorder\
  \ your copy today to ensure that you can start using the great character options\
  \ within at the start of Pathfinder Society Organized Play’s Year of the Demon,\
  \ which launches at Gen Con Indy on August 15.</p> \n     <p>Mark Moreland<br> <i>Developer</i></p>\
