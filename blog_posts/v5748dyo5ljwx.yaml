  \ \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">A common trope of many science fiction stories\
  \ is the ability of characters to be able to improve themselves with science, often\
  \ in the form of cybernetic enhancements. In the <a href=\"/products/btpy9tqw?Starfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Subscription\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em></a>, these kinds of augmentations fall into a\
  \ few broad categories—cybernetics, biotech, and personal upgrades. Cybernetics\
  \ and biotech are handled using roughly the same rules, while personal upgrades\
  \ have their own system.</p> \n    <p>Personal upgrades represent any system—be\
  \ it technological, magical, or a hybrid of the two—that increases a character's\
  \ ability scores. Personal upgrades are useful, but not crucial to most character\
  \ concepts because of how ability score generation and level-based increases are\
  \ handled. In Starfinder, when a character reaches 5th level, and every 5 levels\
  \ thereafter, the character increases 4 ability scores of the player's choice. Also\
  \ if the ability score is a 16 or lower, it increases by +2, while scores of 17\
  \ or more increase by +1. This makes it easy for characters to shore up ability\
  \ scores that turn out to be too low to produce the effect desired in mid-level\
  \ and high-level play, without forcing a player to decide between improving a key\
  \ ability score and improving weak ones.</p> \n    <p>As a result, personal upgrades\
  \ are kept very simple. Over the course of a character's career, beginning around\
  \ 3rd level or so, they can buy one personal upgrade that grants a +2 to one ability\
  \ score, one that grants a +4, and one that grants a +6. It doesn't matter if these\
  \ are mystic ability crystals, technological synaptic enhancers, or some hybrid\
  \ system, each character can successfully use only three of them, each at a different\
  \ level of ability boost.</p> \n    <p>Cybernetics and biotech work differently,\
  \ as they come in a wide range of item levels, and can be as simple as gaining a\
  \ fully function prosthetic limb to replace a lost body part, or as complex as installing\
  \ a dragon gland that gives you a breath weapon attack. Other forms of augmentation,\
  \ such as necrografts, are mentioned as existing in the Core Rulebook but don't\
  \ have full descriptions there. (Hint: keep your eyes on the Adventure Path!) Here's\
  \ an example of a cybernetic augmentation:</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <div class=\"\
  stat-block\"> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-title\">CARDIAC ACCELERATOR <span class=\"\
  stat-block-cr\">SYSTEM: HEART</span></p> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Price</b>\
  \ 3,850 credits <b>Level</b> 6</p> \n      <p class=\"stat-block\">This implant\
  \ plugs directly into your heart and can be triggered to overclock the performance\
  \ of your heart and circulatory system. When you run, charge, or take a move action\
  \ to move, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to increase your speed (in the relevant\
  \ mode of movement) by 20 feet for that action. This extra movement is treated as\
  \ an enhancement bonus.</p> \n      <p class=\"stat-block\">Alternatively, you can\
  \ spend 1 Resolve Point as a reaction when you attempt a Reflex saving throw to\
  \ gain a +1 enhancement bonus to your roll.</p> \n     </div>\n    </blockquote>\
  \ \n    <p>Each augmentation has a system it replaces or modifies, such as an arm,\
  \ the throat, or your skin. You can't have more than one augmentation applied to\
  \ the same system—once you add a dragon gland, you can't also get a vocal modulator\
  \ installed, as they're both throat system augmentations. The price listed for each\
  \ augmentation includes the cost of having it professionally installed, which normally\
  \ takes about an hour per level of the augmentation. While a minimum level of skill\
  \ is required to do this, there's no check involved—adding augmentations has become\
  \ a routine outpatient procedure in the universe of Starfinder, with no significant\
  \ risks of failure or complication. You can also have old augmentations removed\
  \ or replaced with new options, though since all augmentations are custom built\
  \ for their specific user, there's no market for used augmentations.</p> \n    <p>Once\
  \ implanted, augmentations work just like your natural limbs and organs—a cybernetic\
  \ arm is no more vulnerable to specific attacks or effects than your natural arm.\
  \ Adding augmentations is essentially a character design choice: they can be useful,\
  \ but no character concept requires them in order to be effective.</p> \n    <p>Owen\
