  \ Pathfinder's Journal</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Thursday, August 25, 2016</p>\
  \ \n    <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">The year\
  \ was 2007. The <em>Dungeon</em> and <em>Dragon</em> magazine license had just ended,\
  \ and all of us in the Editorial Pit were sweating bullets over this new baby called\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath\">Pathfinder Adventure Path</a>—a baby that\
  \ was going to need to grow up and get a job quick so that we could all keep paying\
  \ rent. The first volume had already been put to bed, and we were trying to figure\
  \ out what to do going forward with this section we'd put in the back called the\
  \ Pathfinder's Journal. The first volume had featured an overview of the Pathfinder\
  \ Society, written by Erik Mona, but now we were thinking about Ed Greenwood's old\
  \ Volo's Guides and wondering if maybe this section could be a chance for us to\
  \ introduce some fun first-person, journal-style adventure fiction to help show\
  \ off our new campaign setting. We had a half-empty map of Varisia, a handful of\
  \ proper nouns, and a couple of characters name-dropped in the first article—Pathfinder\
  \ Eando Kline and Venture-Captain Shevala. What more did we need?</p> \n     <p>Since\
  \ we were short on time, Jason Bulmahn and I wrote the second and third entries\
  \ simultaneously. I'd published a few short stories other places, but I was still\
  \ nervous as I turned mine in—a story called \"Hand of the Handless,\" set in a\
  \ mostly unknown little city called Kaer Maga. A few days later, Wes Schneider and\
  \ James Jacobs took me aside and told me that not only were they cool with my story,\
  \ they were putting me in charge of the section. From that moment forward, I'd be\
  \ the steward of the continuing adventures of Eando Kline, hiring the best authors\
  \ I could find and helping them showcase the world of Golarion. I was twenty-three\
  \ years old.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb180\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/SecondDarkness/PZO9018-EandoKline.jpg\"\

  \     <br><i>Illustration by Jason Engle</i>\n     </div> \n     <p>Over the next\
  \ seven years, the Pathfinder's Journal and I grew together. Somewhere around the\
  \ start of <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/curseOfTheCrimsonThrone\">Curse of\
  \ the Crimson Throne</a>, we realized that Eando's adventures ought to have a point,\
  \ and the grand arc we crafted took three whole adventure paths to complete. This\
  \ odyssey was eventually compiled as <a href=\"/products/btpy8k9k\"><em>The Compass\
  \ Stone</em></a>, and from there we gave Eando his well-deserved rest (or rebellion)\
  \ and moved on to having authors write entire six-part novellas in each AP, including\
  \ folks like Dave Gross, Elaine Cunningham, Wes Schneider, and more. A few years\
  \ ago, as my job responsibilities started to include more and more management, I\
  \ handed the journal off to Senior Editor Chris Carey and Developer Adam Daigle,\
  \ who took the torch and ran with it.</p> \n     <p>I can't explain how important\
  \ the journal has been to us, and especially to me. It was the constant process\
  \ of developing—and often writing—chapters of those early journals that eventually\
  \ convinced me I might have what it took to write a novel, and I know I wasn't the\
  \ only one that learned from it. The <a href=\"/pathfinder/tales\">Pathfinder Tales</a>\
  \ novel line grew directly out of the success of the journal, and it's no surprise\
  \ that many authors—and even characters like Dave Gross's Varian and Radovan—leapt\
  \ straight from journal to novels, with great aplomb.Yet probably the biggest impact\
  \ the journal had was on the setting. In those early days, we were still building\
  \ the Inner Sea region with every story, and tons of iconic characters and locations\
  \ first saw the light of day there. It's where we learned about bloatmages and orc\
  \ warbeasts, where we met Shoanti burn riders and Urglin gladiators and heard a\
  \ serpentfolk's telepathic speech in our heads.</p> \n     <p>And now, almost a\
  \ decade later, we're bringing it to a close. Starting with <a href=\"/products/btpy9npj\"\
  >Pathfinder Adventure Path #115</a>, the first of the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/ironfangInvasion\"\
  >Ironfang Invasion</a> volumes, we'll be retiring the Pathfinder's Journal. (Fun\
  \ fact: We were actually going to retire the section half a year earlier, then realized\
  \ we'd be kicking ourselves forever if we didn't take the chance to let six different\
  \ authors write six Lovecraftian stories!) The reasons for retirement are many,\
  \ but in the end, it comes down to the fact that we just don't need it anymore.\
  \ The journal was always about seeing Golarion through the eyes of its residents,\
  \ rather than the omniscient overview of a GM. Today, we have the Pathfinder Tales\
  \ novel line, with far more space in which to bring you the best stories, the most\
  \ vibrant character, and the most detailed locations. It's the Pathfinder's Journal\
  \ all grown up.</p> \n     <p>So what's going to be taking the Journal's place?\
  \ In short: more! More and longer backmatter articles! Longer adventures! More monsters!\
  \ More of all the material Pathfinder Adventure Path already provides to help you\
  \ run your game. It's not my place to spoil what Crystal's got in store for you,\
  \ but from what I've overheard the developers giggling about, it's going to be awesome.\
  \ And for those readers who miss the fiction—come on over to <a href=\"/pathfinder/tales\"\
  >the Pathfinder Tales section</a> and let us hook you up.</p> \n     <p>Thanks to\
  \ everyone who's read the journal all these years. We wouldn't be who we are without\
  \ it—and without all of you.</p> \n     <p>James L. Sutter<br> <i>Creative Director</i></p>\
