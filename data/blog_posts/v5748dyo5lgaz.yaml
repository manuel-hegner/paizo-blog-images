  description\">All good things must come to an end, and this week we look at the\
  \ end (or at least, the lowest level) of the <a href=\"\"><i>Emerald Spire</i></a>.\
  \ Of course, the end of a superdungeon is something a lot of players never get to\
  \ see (as Erik Mona discussed a bit in <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lg8y\">his\
  \ teaser last week</a>), so we also thought we might expand this sneak peek to include\
  \ two maps from the adventure.</span></p> \n     <p>When discussing the fact that\
  \ every dungeon level had to fit on a Flip-Mat, Erik briefly mentioned that this\
  \ requirement drove our authors to find creative ways to get the most out of the\
  \ space available. One good example of this is The Clockwork Maze, which has sections\
  \ likely to initially confuse the players and that are certain to force players\
  \ to work harder than a typcial ten foot wide corridor. We don’t want to give away\
  \ the whole secret of the level, but a glance at the map is a pretty big hint why\
  \ the level has \"clockwork\" in its title.</p> \n     <p>Other levels use the available\
  \ space on a Flip-Map in a more traditional way, but include multiple environments,\
  \ hazards, and unusual geometry to increase the variety available in the dungeon\
  \ experience. The final level of the dungeon, The Emeral Root, is a good example\
  \ of this kind of creative map.</p> \n     <p>Of course even a great map isn’t very\
  \ useful if you don’t have enounters to fill it with. To learn a little more about\
  \ these levels and how they came to be, we we spoke to the CEO and Publisher of\
  \ Sasquatch Game Studio LLC, Richard Baker, and our own Creative Director, James\
  \ Jacobs.</p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p><b>How do you define a \"Superdungeon\"\
  ? What is your favorite dungeon or superdungeon experience in your personal gaming\
  \ history?</b></p> \n      <p><b>Rich</b> To me, a superdungeon is any adventure\
  \ that you could reasonably base a whole campaign around. It will provide months\
  \ and months of play, characters will level up a good 8 or 10 times in the course\
  \ of the game, and the players are up against an epic threat or fighting their way\
  \ through a truly amazing setting. I suppose I might further refine that by saying\
  \ that a super-dungeon does that all in the context of a single sprawling underground\
  \ maze (you can certainly have super-adventures that do the same thing but across\
  \ multiple locales). So, it's a particular flavor of super-adventure, I guess.<br>\
  \ My personal favorites were Undermountain—really the gold standard of superdungeons,\
  \ even if a lot of the map was left for the DM to populate—and more recently City\
  \ of the Spider-Queen, which is probably more of a superadventure. When I was developing\
  \ that adventure, we had James Wyatt (the adventure author) run it for us with a\
  \ great group of players, and we had a blast.</p> \n      <p><b>James</b> I define\
  \ a Superdungeon as a dungeon that you can run an entire campaign in. My favorite\
  \ superdungeon is Greyhawk’s Maure Castle, which was featured several times in Dungeon\
  \ magazine back in the day. On Golarion, though, my favorite superdungeon is Hollow\
  \ Mountain, and I hope to some day get to personally design and develop that site\
  \ into a significant adventure location. At which point I can see it supplanting\
  \ Maure Castle as my favorite. Unless I do the same for the Crimson Citadel first,\
  \ that is.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurb180\">\n       <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderModules/PZO9545-Klarkosh.jpg\"\

  \       <br>Illustration by Jorge Fares\n      </div> \n      <p><b>What is your\
  \ level of the Emerald Spire Superdungeon called? What theme, if any, does the level\
  \ have?</b></p> \n      <p><b>Rich</b> My level of Emerald Spire is the Clockwork\
  \ Maze. This is the lair of the first major villain in the Spire, the Numerian wizard\
  \ Klarkosh. As you might expect, it has a strong clockwork theme—the entire dungeon\
  \ configuration can be altered by using control levers in different spots. In fact,\
  \ the players will have to do just a little bit of puzzle-solving to figure out\
  \ how to change the dungeon geometry to navigate through the level. The monsters\
  \ are mostly constructs of different kinds, since Klarkosh was previously described\
  \ as a master of making constructs.<br> I also wrote the description of Fort Inevitable\
  \ that begins the adventure, and did most of the coordination and direction for\
  \ the whole project. I got to see each author's contribution as they came up with\
  \ it!</p> \n      <p><b>James</b> My level of the Emerald Spire is the final one—\
  the \"Emerald Root.\" It’s theme is hard to divulge without revealing a lot of spoilers,\
  \ since it contains the source and reason and history of the Emerald Spire itself,\
  \ but it goes beyond that and reveals some key bits of information about the Darklands—\
  particularly the vaults of Orv. In fact, the opportunity to explore some of the\
  \ mysteries of these vaults is the primary reason I pounced on designing the lowest\
  \ level of Emerald Spire in the first place.</p> \n      <p><b>What where the inspirations\
  \ you drew on for your Emerald Spire level, and what are you hoping players get\
  \ out of it?</b></p> \n      <p><b>Rich</b> My primary inspiration was really just\
  \ delivering on what had already been said about the Spire. In the Thornkeep sourcebook\
  \ we mentioned a few key facts about the Spire, so I took it upon myself to make\
  \ sure the Emerald Spire superdungeon delivered on those teasers. For the villain,\
  \ I admit I was thinking of Tharok, the half-robot leader of the Fatal Five, the\
  \ arch-enemies of the Legion of Superheroes. Klarkosh is kind of a magical version\
  \ of Tharok.</p> \n      <p><b>James</b> There’s a fair amount of Lovecraft inspiration\
  \ in my level of Emerald Spire, both in the monster mix and in the story beyond\
  \ what’s going on in that level, but that also ties in to some of the deep continuity\
  \ of the history of Orv and the Darklands themselves. And by \"Lovecraft\" in this\
  \ case, I’m not talking about Cthulhu and tentacle monsters, but about the idea\
  \ that humanity was not the first to rise to power on this ball of dirt (Earth)\
  \ or that ball of dirt (Golarion) hurtling blindly through the uncaring gulfs of\
  \ space.</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>We really appreciate our Creative Director\
  \ and the Chief Sasquatch (Editorial Note, Rich told me to call him this) taking\
  \ time out of their busy schedules to share some of the Emerald Spire with us!</p>\
