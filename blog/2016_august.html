Yet when a mysterious tsunami wracks her island's shore, she and her fearless crew must sail out to explore the strange island that's risen from the sea floor...</i></p>

<blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 1: Harbor Wave</h3>

<p>Jendara put down the file and checked the edge of her blade. She'd worked out the last of the nicks, but the sword could use a touch of the whetstone to bring out the edge. She reached for the bottle of oil at her elbow and paused. It was the kind of autumn morning in the Ironbound Archipelago that she loved. The smoke of her village's fires rose up in straight blue streaks, and the sound of children at play resounded in the crisp air.</p>
<p>"Ho, Jendara!"</p>
<p>She turned from her makeshift workbench, a split length of driftwood balanced on two fat stumps, already smiling. "Good morning, Boruc."</p>
<p>"No sign of the Milady yet?" The big man tucked his thumbs into his belt&mdash;nearly hidden under the bulge of his belly&mdash;and glanced out at the harbor. </p>
<p>"Not yet, but the tide only turned a few hours ago. The boatyards at Halgrim aren't that close."</p>
<p>"That captain husband of yours ought to hurry." Boruc grinned, and his teeth showed brightly against the red of his beard. A native islander like Jendara, he'd become one of her closest friends in the time since she'd returned to the archipelago. "Doesn't he know it's your birthday?"</p>
<p>"You remembered?" She laughed and got to her feet.</p>
<p>The ground moved beneath her in a sickening shudder.</p>
<p>She grabbed onto the workbench to steady herself. The earth jolted and jumped, and from the cottage behind her came the smashing of glass. A heavy yelm of thatch crashed down off the roof.</p>
<p>Her mind leaped to her son. "Kran!" She stumbled as the ground gave a last shake, then found her footing again. She sheathed the sword and broke into a run. "He went to the beach with Oric and that damn dog."</p>
<p>"You ain't got much time," Boruc warned.</p>
<p>Jendara knew it. She'd grown up on an island not that different from this one, and she'd spent her life on the sea&mdash;she'd seen what could happen after an earthquake. She scanned the horizon. It was probably too early for the ocean to rise up, but given the power of the shaking, the tsunami wouldn't be long.</p>
<p>A woman raced out into the street. "Fire! My house is on fire!"</p>
<p>Any other time, the rest of the village would have rushed to help her, but not now. People stumbled out of their houses, running uphill. Jendara could already see the tide turning in the harbor, the water pulling itself away from the shore like a blanket whipped back from a muddy bed. </p>
<p>"Kran!" she bellowed. The boy had brains. He knew he had to get away from the shore. </p>
<p>A man shoved her aside. </p>
<p>"Hey!"</p>
<p>"Gotta get uphill!" he shouted over his shoulder, and she saw the chicken clutched under his arm and the blue beads strung in his beard. The baker, Norg.</p>
<p>His wife ran behind him. "Get out of here, Jendara!"</p>
<p>"Kran!" Jendara shouted again. The boats at the piers were already high and dry. </p>
<p>"Jendara!" A tall man with sandy hair and beard&mdash;Morul&mdash;caught her by the arm. "Tell me the boys are already headed up to Boruc's house."</p>
<p>"I haven't found them yet." She caught the look of panic in his eyes. "I'll get the boys. You get Leyla to high ground!"</p>
<p>"She can't walk yet&mdash;the fever's got her knocked out."</p>
<p>"Then you better hurry!"</p>
<p>She broke away from him, her own fear climbing in her throat. Kran was a smart lad and levelheaded for a twelve-year-old. He should have made it up from the beach by now.</p>
<p>The crowds pressed against her and she found herself shoving aside old men, children&mdash;anyone that stood between her and her son. She could already see the ridge of water forming on the horizon. It didn't look like much right now, but she knew these waves to be deceptive. When it hit the island, it could be devastating.</p>
<p>Her boots slid on the mud of the beach. Were they down by the boats or over by the caves? The beach itself was empty, dotted with abandoned clam shovels and buckets.</p>
<p>"Kran!"</p>
<p>He couldn't answer, of course. That only made it all the worse. Her boy, her precious boy, was mute.</p>
<p>"Help!"</p>
<p>But Oric wasn't. Kran's best friend shrieked like a stuck pig, his voice bouncing off the rocks by the caves. Anger lit Jendara's blood on fire. Even on a good day, the caves were dangerous.</p>
<p>She raced toward the rocks.</p>
<p>And then skidded to a stop. </p>
<p>"Oh, shit." </p>
<p>She stared at the two boys on the nearest outcropping of rocks, unable to quite make sense of what was happening. Her son had Oric by the arm, but the other lad was clearly stuck between the two great rocks&mdash;a space she herself had passed through a dozen times collecting mussels.</p>
<p>"Help!" Oric screamed again. Kran looked over his shoulder, his eyes black circles in a too-white face. His little dog burst out of the gap between the rocks, whimpering. She was caught in something as well&mdash;some kind of thick, sparkly rope had wound itself around her chest, binding her to the stones.</p>
<p>Jendara scrambled up beside Kran. The ocean began to growl softly, the sound of all the rocks and debris it had sucked up now grinding along at the bottom of the sea bed. She could feel sweat prickling in her armpits.</p>
<p>The same tough rope had snared Oric, she saw. Jendara drew her sword. She'd never seen rope like this. It clung to the tow-headed boy with the stickiness of tar, and it shimmered with a pale purple-blue light. It reminded her of a spider's web&mdash;if the spider were the size of a small cottage.</p>
<p>She hacked through it, glad she'd sharpened her blade. The roaring was getting louder.</p>
<p>Kran jumped down beside the dog, pulling on its front legs.</p>
<p>"Cut the dog free," Jendara snapped at him. </p>
<p>He shook his head wildly and held up an empty hand.</p>
<p>"Where's your damned belt knife?" </p>
<p> "He must have left it at my house." Oric was nearly babbling. He wriggled and twitched as the words bubbled out. "We were whittling and then we needed mussels for your birthday dinner and&mdash;" He broke off at the fury in her eyes.</p>
<p>She seized the boy by the armpits and yanked him free of the rocks. A strip of skin ripped free of the back of her hand, stuck fast to the strange silk, and she hissed. </p>
<p>"Now run!" She slashed the binding on the dog and then sheathed her sword. "Get running, both of you!"</p>
<p>They slipped and slid on the mud. The dog raced past them. It might have been a half-sized, ugly thing, but it wasn't stupid. </p>
<p>Jendara risked a glance over her shoulder. The wave had picked up speed. It towered over the bay, a wall of mud and debris ready to crash down and swallow the island. They were never going to make it to the safety of the hilltop.</p>
<p>She put on a burst of speed to pass the boys. "To the meeting hall!" She stretched her hand behind her and caught Kran's sleeve. </p>
<p>The meeting hall was the largest and sturdiest building in the village, and stood on a knoll of rock above the main street. Decorative finials stuck up from each end of the high ridgeline of its shingled roof, while colorfully painted columns outlined a covered porch. She ran her hands over the green-and-blue surface of the nearest column. Kran wouldn't have any problem shinnying up it.</p>
<p>"On the roof," she ordered. He was up the column in a flash, and then immediately put out his hand to help his friend. Oric leaped onto the column but slid down again. He was bigger than Kran and less agile.</p>
<p>Jendara gave him a shove and let him scramble up onto her shoulders. His boot knocked into her head as he struggled up onto the roof. </p>
<p>The dog whimpered.</p>

<div class="blurbCenter"><a href="/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8534-Cover.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8534-Cover_500.jpeg"></a><br /><i>Illustration by Jesper Ejsing</i></div>


<p>Jendara risked a look over her shoulder and felt her stomach twist. The sea had arrived in the harbor. It raised itself above the beach, hoisting longships and sailboats up into its muddy mass with a nasty crashing crunch.</p>
<p>There was no time for shinnying up the column. Jendara grabbed the dog by its collar and flung it onto the porch roof. Then she jammed her belt knife into the column and pulled herself up. Her hand closed on the edge of the roof as the great wave hit the first row of houses.</p>
<p>Walls boomed and crumpled, wooden joints screeching as they ground together. Jendara hung for a second, and then Kran grabbed the back of her jacket. She came up onto the roof.</p>
<p>It wasn't high enough here. They had to get to the top of the building, the ridgeline with its finials&mdash;they could hang onto those.</p>
<p>"Up!" she shouted. </p>
<p>Kran was already moving. The next section of roof was much higher and steeper, and for a second she thought he wouldn't be able to get a grip on it, but he did. Oric was right behind him. He caught a shingle and dangled for second. Then the shingle broke free.</p>
<p>The boy hit the roof of the porch and slid down. Jendara lunged for him. Her fingers closed on his wrist and his weight hit the end of his arm with a crack. He screamed in pain and grabbed her with his other hand just as the wave smashed into the side of the meeting hall.</p>
<p>The water slammed down on Jendara, driving out light and air and all sense of up or down. An incredible crackling and ripping resounded around her. For a second, she couldn't breathe.</p>
<p>Then with a powerful crunching, the porch roof ripped free of the meeting hall. Jendara gasped for air as she popped to the surface of the water.</p>
<p>The roof slid along the side of the meeting hall, riding the muddy mass of the wave. Oric clung to her, and she clung to the edge of the porch. If the roof broke apart or sank, the debris caught in the floodwater would crush them.</p>
<p>The wave drove them into the side of the next house. The walls had cracked and buckled against the power of the water. Wood groaned and snapped all around them. Over the powerful stink of mud and brine, the smell of smoke was choking. The earthquake had caused its own damage via fireplaces and woodstoves.</p>
<p>She looked around, desperate for her boy. She made out his silhouette on the still-intact ridgeline of the meeting hall and felt herself relax a little. If he was still all right, she could focus on saving herself and Oric.</p>
<p>"Jendara!" Oric's voice cracked with fear.</p>
<p>Jendara whipped her head around. A wall of debris was headed right for them: wood and rubble and a still-recognizable door, jutting out of the swirling water like a giant knife. </p>
<p>Jendara shoved against the broken house. She wasn't going to die pinned to a cottage, stabbed to death and buried in muck. She'd killed a giant and a troll and faced down a horde of barbarian shapeshifters. She had a family, a business, friends. Damn it, she wasn't going to drown!</p>
<p>The porch roof popped free of the broken house. The figurehead of a longship smashed into the wall where they'd been trapped, and with a groan, the house began to collapse on itself. The porch roof bobbed into the middle of the street. The water had carried them uphill, but it was still up to the bottoms of the windows, at least four feet high, and it would only get higher until the floodwaters withdrew.</p>
<p>Jendara searched for safety. They couldn't stay on this makeshift raft. Another wave would rip it apart or smash it into bits. Her eye caught the building on the far side of the street&mdash;the blacksmith's. The only stone building in the village. Its porch wasn't much, but it was the best shelter she could see. </p>
<p>She grabbed a length of board floating beside her and poled hard. The road beneath her climbed the hill, and the current was fighting her now as the water pulled back for its next pounding wave. The raft shuddered as it moved slowly through the churning water.</p>
<p>She drove her pole between the slats of someone's garden fence. The support column for the blacksmith's overhanging roof was just a few feet away. Someplace nearby someone screamed for help, and her heart gave a squeeze. </p>
<p>But she couldn't help anyone if she didn't help herself first. </p>
<p>She jerked her chin at the porch, arms trembling to hold the roof-raft in place. "Get over there!" </p>
<p>Oric grabbed onto the fence with his good hand and jumped off the raft. The water was shoulder deep on him, but he didn't complain. He might not have Kran's stoicism, but he was still an islander through and through. </p>
<p>Jendara jumped off the raft. The water tugged the raft away in an instant, smashing it into a floating log. It sank immediately.</p>
<p>Here on the other side of the sturdy garden fence, there was a little less floating debris. A plow sluiced past, grinding against Jendara's side and bumping up against the fence with a heavy thud. She hoped the fence would hold a little longer.</p>
<p>Wading was hard. The water pulled her back with every step, and rocks and broken tree branches slammed against her chest and legs. Oric slipped and slid, then made it up onto the porch. Though the difference in height was slight, she thanked the ancestors as she followed him up onto the porch. There was less wreckage moving in the water, and the current wasn't as strong. She took hold of the porch column, then frowned. </p>
<p>Oric gripped the column with one arm, but the other hung uselessly at his side. He must have dislocated it when she'd grabbed him on the roof. If another big wave hit, he'd be gone.</p>
<p>She felt for her belt, the leather stiff in the saltwater. Cursing, she got it off and around the column. "Grab onto that," she ordered.</p>
<p>Then the next wave hit, and all she could do was cling to the column and the boy and try to protect her head as mud and smashed stonework and broken bits of everything battered them. She coughed and spluttered. </p>
<p>The next wave seemed a little smaller&mdash;or perhaps she was simply used to it. She lost count of them as they came, driving flotsam into the corners of the porch and dragging it back out into the street. A dead duck washed up against the pillar and floated in the eddy, its yellow feet sticking up in the air as the water spun it in a slow circle. Then it sank beneath the muck.</p>
<p>Between the waves, she stared at the roof of the meeting hall and watched Kran and the dog huddle in silent misery as the water slowly withdrew. He had never felt so far away, and she had never been so powerless to help him. She had thrown away her old life&mdash;a dangerous life, to be sure, spent serving bloodthirsty Besmara, the pirate goddess&mdash;to find someplace safe to finish bringing up her boy. Leave it to nature to prove her wrong.</p>
<p>Oric shivered beside her, and she risked letting go of the column to grip his shoulder. If only he hadn't gotten caught in that stuff down by the rocks, that strange silky rope like spider webbing. They would all be up at Boruc's house waiting for the water to recede, warm and dry and safe. </p>
<p>It was just bad luck, she supposed. As the Varisians might say, it was just a bad alignment of the stars, bringing misfortune down upon their entire village. She shivered and tightened her grip on the column. </p>
<p>The breeze strengthened, pushing aside a few clouds and inviting the sun to play on the surface of the floodwaters. They were receding, she realized. The houses on this stretch of the street were badly battered, and the ones closer to the beach were smashed and ruined, but at least the worst was over.</p>
<p>"I've got to get Kran," she told Oric. "You stay here."</p>
<p>"Don't leave me!"</p>
<p>"You'll be fine. The water's going down. And Kran's been alone this whole time."</p>
<p>"We would have all been out of here if he hadn't wanted to make you that stupid present," Oric grumbled. </p>
<p>Jendara shot him a stern look. "You'll be fine," she repeated. She took a careful step down from the porch. Something shifted beneath her feet and she gritted her teeth. There was no way to see what lay beneath the surface of the water&mdash;the stuff was as opaque as milk and as dark as garden soil. The worst might be over, but that didn't mean it was safe.</p>
<p>It was like capturing a rival pirate ship, she thought, setting her foot carefully before taking the next cautious step. They fought hard on the deck and you felt your blood boil as you cut your way forward, knowing every hand was set to kill you. But that was only the obvious danger. Down below was where the real nasty stuff waited: the injured happy to take someone to Pharasma's Boneyard when they went, the vicious cook devoted to his captain, the booby traps some loyal mate had set when all seemed lost. </p>
<p>Back in her pirate days, she'd seen plenty of her crewmates killed after the battle was ostensibly won, and she'd learned a thing or two. She kept her focus on the ground and the debris floating around her knees, and she moved slowly, even if every bit of her wanted to race back to the meeting hall and make sure Kran was all right.</p>
<p>Then she was there. The porch columns were slick with mud, and some stood at odd angles. She didn't trust them. She looked around for an alternate route.</p>
<p>To her left, Kran's dog barked.</p>
<p>She turned. The dog stood on the canted roof of the house beside the hall. At some point, a massive fir tree had toppled down on the broken house, and now lay at an angle, its top driven into the colorful wall of the meeting hall and its roots tangled in the wreckage below. The dog must have climbed down the tree.</p>
<p>"Smarter than you look," she grumbled. The yellow-and-white mutt wasn't the companion she would have picked for her boy. It wasn't a sturdy herding dog or a fine hound bred for hunting, just some stray he'd found by the docks, good for nothing but eating Jendara's venison. "Come here ..." She tried to remember its name. "Fylga. Come."</p>
<p>The dog scrambled onto the tree trunk and began climbing back up to the roof of the meeting hall. </p>
<p>"Or maybe not." Jendara picked her way toward the base of the tree and gave it a shove. It felt solid. </p>
<p>In the distance, wood groaned and crumpled. Someone called for help again, the voice thin and tired. She had to get moving; people needed her.</p>
<p>"Kran!" </p>
<p>The boy peered over the roofline at her. He pointed at the tree and spread his hands questioningly.</p>
<p>"It's safe, I think. But hurry!"</p>
<p>He came down the tree cautiously, clinging to it like a bear cub. Jendara found herself reaching for him before he even made it to the halfway point. Her lip hurt from biting into it. The meeting hall could collapse, the tree could shift, the house could crumple more&mdash;</p>
<p>And then she had a hold of him and he was on the ground and she was squeezing him tight, tighter than she'd hugged him in years. He was twelve, after all. And he'd never been a cuddly boy, even when he'd been little.</p>
<p>He kissed her cheek and hugged her back. Then he pulled away, a smile spreading over his face. With his black hair hanging in wet clumps, that smile looked even whiter and broader than usual.</p>
<p>He pointed at the demolished house beside them, and it took Jendara a minute to make out what he saw in the midst of the broken beams and the sludge of mud. There was only the hint of colorful paint to remind her of the meeting hall's porch columns, one of which had been driven through the ruins of the house next door.</p>
<p>And there, jutting out of what had probably been a blue-and-green painted sea star, was the belt knife she'd stabbed into the wood as a handhold just before the wave had hit. Kran wrenched it free with a grunt, and handed it to her, beaming.</p>
<p>Maybe her stars weren't so badly aligned after all.</p>

<p class="date">Tuesday, August 30, 2016</p>

<div itemprop = "articlebody">

<p itemprop = "description">Last year, while planning the class deck schedule, a most Gobtastic plan was concocted. In addition to supporting Organized Play using <a href = "/products/btpy96ie">Ranzak</a>, <a href = "/products/btpy9fpr">Ekkie</a>, and our newest promo goblin  <a href = "/products/btpy9nbv">Tup</a>, we could create playable versions of all the main goblins from the <a href = "/products/btpy8j5w"><em>We Be Goblins!</em></a> RPG modules. To celebrate, we could also do a short <a href = "/products/btpy9o0o">Season of the Goblins</a> (then called "We Be Card Goblins!") based on the first couple of adventures. Little did we realize that two of our coolest fans, Tyler Beck (<a href = "/people/cartmanbeck">cartmanbeck</a> on the boards) and David Jacobson (aka <a href = "/people/theryonstormrune">Theryon Stormrune</a>), would beat us to it. When we at Lone Shark Games saw their work, we knew there was absolutely no point to us redoing it for Season of the Goblins. But let's hear it directly from them!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>David</b>: Back before there was a <a href = "http://www.drivethrucards.com/builder/pathfinder" target = "_blank">DriveThruCards custom Card Creator</a> and before there was a <a href = "/products/btpy92zj"><em>Skull & Shackles Base Set</em></a>, I had wanted to take the <a href = ""><em>We Be Goblins!</em></a> module and turn it into a card game adventure. Unfortunately without the ability to create cards, my vision was limited on how to proceed. My thoughts turned to proxying cards but that wasn't practical on the required scale. Over a year passed and through the <a href = "/threads/rzs2sy8t">HawkCon</a> meetings, I met Tyler Beck. Somehow the subject came up and I found a kindred spirit. Now, Tyler is a creative fiend. He loves to throw ideas onto "paper." I soon discovered that he had a lot more done with <em>We Be Goblins!</em> than I had. So I started working with him to polish and fit the work into the current structure of the game. And around that point, the Card Creator came online, allowing us to create some of the proxy cards we needed to bring the adventure to life.</p>

<p><b>Tyler</b>: While David was designing his version of <em>We Be Goblins!</em> for Pathfinder Adventure Card Game, I unknowingly was working on a very similar idea. I had decided that PACG is fun, and goblins are fun, and so PACG plus goblins would be even more fun! By June 2015, I had started writing card text, and by the time July rolled around, I was finished with my first draft of the scenarios, as well as five goblin characters. I decided that I wanted to do something more with them than just play with my friends: I would go to PaizoCon and run the game there! I emailed Tanis and asked her if she'd be interested in writing up a special boon for those who play in my special goblin-themed games at PaizoCon, and she was tentatively excited about the idea. Once I ran into David at the HawkCon event, I knew I had the perfect person to get my crazy ideas boiled down into really clean card text, and we started working together on the cards. David's meticulous editing made a huge difference, and we quickly had a great set of scenarios all printed up, and we went into playtesting mode. We each ran the game for our friends, and everyone had a blast (especially those who played Mogmurch)! Eventually Tanis acquiesced to my idea of making the event a sanctioned game, and she ended up writing up an absolutely amazing special boon for those who would play in our game at PaizoCon. Unfortunately, I found that I would not be able to attend PaizoCon, and all would be lost... except that I had an excellent proxy!</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZOACGS02B01E-ShaleluAndosa.jpg"><img src = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZOACGS02B01E-ShaleluAndosa_180.jpeg"></a>

<i>Wait, not those proxies.</i></div>

<p><b>David</b>: A couple months before PaizoCon 2016, Tyler asked me if I would run the <em>We Be Goblins!</em> event at PaizoCon. It was my first PaizoCon, but we had put in a lot of time into our work and I wanted to make sure it was a success. So I agreed. We'd have three sessions with two tables each session: one run by me, one by Tanis. I kept reading about it in the blogs leading up to PaizoCon. It made me nervous and excited. Tyler and I kept creating and refining our cards with the Card Creator, and then had two finished sets made. Then I got to Seattle and it was a big success. The players enjoyed the adventure and gave us great feedback. I changed a few things between sessions based on what people thought and how it played. I think that was one of the most important things about the journey of our work. So I made notes and headed back home. We had planned on creating a second adventure based on <a href = "/products/btpy8xc3"><em>We Be Goblins Too! </em></a></p>

<div class = "blurbCenter">
<img src = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20160830-Photo1.jpg">
<img src = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20160830-Photo2.jpg"></a><br />
<i>Even got Gaby "goblified"!</i></div>

<p>But Paizo's Season of the Goblins had been announced, apparently making our work (and future work on the second adventure) moot. So Tyler and I started working immediately on our other ideas. Again, his creative madness had started and I was just trying to keep pace with the new adventure.</p>

<p><b>Tyler</b>: Then we got tapped on the shoulder as Lone Shark was planning on adapting the We Be Goblins! module for the mini-season. They had seen our work and realized that it would be a great starting point. So we were asked if we'd be willing to contribute to the design of the Season of the Goblins! mini-season, and we were happy to take on the challenge. One major question was how to make it work with Pathfinder Society Adventure Card Guild play. We had designed these scenarios to be played with goblin characters, but for organized play, any legal character would need to be allowed. David came up with the idea that any non-goblin character may have been transformed into a goblin by the work of the dark deity Lamashtu, and we were off! We had designed these scenarios to be played with a mountain of custom cards, including custom goblin characters and decks, boons like allies <a href = "http://www.drivethrucards.com/product/166149/Bruthazmus--Custom-Card" target = "_blank">Bruthazmus</a> and <a href = "http://www.drivethrucards.com/product/180790/Goblin-Raider--Custom-Card" target = "_blank">Goblin Raider</a>, and banes like the monster <a href = "http://www.drivethrucards.com/product/173000/Shopkeeps-Daughter--Custom-Card" target = "_blank">Shopkeep's Daughter</a> and henchman <a href  = "http://www.drivethrucards.com/product/173006/Ven-Vinder--Custom-Card" target = "_blank">Ven Vinder</a>. PFSACG play would be problematic if every table needed so many custom cards, so we pared it down to only the most useful cards. Then we sent it over to Keith Richmond to do his magic.</p>

<p><b>David</b>: And then it was time to head to Indianapolis for Gen Con. Again, I wondered how it was going to look and how it was going to play. Tyler and I hadn't seen a copy of the adventure yet. I had signed up to play sessions of Season of the Goblins! as well as volunteer in the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game section of the Sagamore ballroom. And just like at PaizoCon, it was a big hit. Paizo had wanted to limit the tables to 4 players, but every session had 5 to 6 players per table with three tables having been "goblified" as we called it. The changes that Keith had made were a perfect match to the original material and the feedback was overwhelmingly positive. People had fun. The new characters from the <a href = "/products/btpy9jcw"><em>Goblins Fight!</em></a> and <a href = "/products/btpy9k5m"><em>Goblins Burn!</em></a> decks played well alongside other class deck characters.</p>

<p>But at least for me, nothing really matched the excitement of hearing that Mike Selinker liked our original work, and seeing our names at the top of the credits page. It makes all the work worth it: the hours reading and re-reading our adventure and card text, getting cards printed and reprinted, playtesting and fixing this card or that card.</p>

<p><b>Keith</b>: I want to thank Tyler and David again for being great fans and playtesters, whose excitement and hard work led to a fun event at PaizoCon and made this season a breeze to develop. I like to think I've added a couple cool twists, like "Goblifying" the boxes by shuffling in the <a href = "/products/btpy9jcw"><em>Goblins Fight!</em></a> and <a href = "/products/btpy9k5m"><em>Goblins Burn!</em></a> cards if you have them, and rewarding access to the goblin promos, but the overwhelming bulk of the work is theirs. The first adventure of Season of the Goblins, <a href = "/products/btpy9o0o"><em>We Be Goblins!</em></a> is available now. We Be (Card) Goblins Too! will be available sometime in the next month. Enjoy the Gobbling!</p>

<p class="date">Tuesday, August 30, 2016</p>

<div itemprop = "articlebody">

<p itemprop="description">Hello from Redmond! After weeks of travel I'm back at the Paizo office, catching up on events and developments in the world of Pathfinder. Which accounts for the lateness of this blog, as I tried to touch base and get a status report on some ongoing projects.</p>

<p>So, a few updates!</p>

<h2>Pathfinder Society Academy</h2>
<p>Thank you to all the volunteers that ran Pathfinder Society Academy events at Gen Con! The youth had a blast and the program received some great attention. In reviewing the feedback, there are a few tweaks we need to make to the program before rolling it out to the general public. So we are pushing back release by a month or two to make sure it is the best program we can offer. For those conventions hoping to run it in the interim, email me and we can discuss options.</p>

<h2>Pathfinder Adventure Card Guild Season of the Runelords Adventures 5 & 6</h2>
<p>With the departure of Tanis and my extended absence from the office, we had another hiccup in the release schedule. I apologize profusely for the delay and can only say that the goblins have really made a mess of things. We are looking at timelines, processes, and workflow so to minimize (and hopefully remove) the issues that arose this season.</p>

<h2>Venture-Officer Appointments/Information Corrections</h2>
<p>Now that I am back in the office I can get working on adding volunteers to the Venture-Officer team and updating contact information. If you sent me an email, I am working my way through the requests in the order they were received. For those submitting applications to join the team, I am reviewing them as well and will be in touch as soon as possible. I thank everyone for their patience!</p>

<h2>Roleplaying Guild Guide Revision</h2>
<p>There is a Guide revision in the works. Thank you to the members of the community who sent feedback on the new format or identified issues. The team is aware of the feedback threads on the forums and the opinions expressed therein. Sifting through the posts and emails will take some time, as well as working the revision into our schedules, so we do not have an anticipated release date, but it will be sooner than the launch of Season 9!</p>

<h2>PAX West</h2>
<p>Pathfinder Society will be out in force at PAX West this weekend at the Washington State Convention Center, Rooms 201-203. There are still volunteer openings available on Friday Night, Sunday Night, and Monday. If interested, contact <a href = "mailto:taenia4000@yahoo.com?Subject=PAX%20West%20Volunteering">Venture-Lieutenant Louis Manko Levite</a>.</p>

<h2>Upcoming Events</h2>
<p>I'm going to start spotlighting events in the weekly blog. Currently, I am looking at events in December/January, to give enough time for people interested in attending to book travel and accomodations. If you would like your event featured on the blog, please send a one to two paragraph summary of the particulars, including what, where, when, and who to contact for more information to <a href = "mailto:pathfindersociety@paizo.com">pathfindersociety@paizo.com</a>.</p>

<p>As a corollary, the Pathfinder Society team is putting together our 2017 travel schedule. If you are hosting a convention and would like a member of the team as a special guest at your event, please email <a href = "mailto:pathfindersociety@paizo.com">pathfindersociety@paizo.com</a> with the particulars. Many factors go into planning our schedules and the more information we have, the easier to plan.</p>

<p>Lots more irons in the fire, but I'm going to pause here for today. For those traveling, stay safe. And remember: Explore, Report, Cooperate!</p>

<p itemprop="description">They’re back for more! The dedicated gamers from the Order of the Amber Die have taken on another maddening task with their marathon sessions. They tackle an entire Adventure Path adventure in one long session over the course of a weekend. What’s better is that they share their experiences with the world. After their Giantslayer marathon they took a short break, but were eager to take on <a href = "/pathfinder/adventurePath/strangeAeons">Strange Aeons</a>. Here’s their first report of the Strange Aeons Experiment. (Careful, there may be some spoilers within.)</p>

<blockquote>

	<h2>Welcome to The Strange Aeons Experiment!</h2>

	<p>In case you missed our exploits in <a href = "http://paizo.com/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lhx3?Giantslayer-Marathon-Part-6">The Giantslayer Endeavor</a> or <a href = "http://paizo.com/threads/rzs2rhtg?The-Emerald-Spire-Project#1">The Emerald Spire Project</a>, here's a briefing:</p>

	<p>Order of the Amber Die is dedicated to completing published adventures. It's what we do. We don't change modules; instead, we put our labors toward bringing them to life as written. We enforce the complete Pathfinder rules set, ask no mercy from our GM, and utilize four core party members with a 15-point build. We've played through 137 published adventures at this point, and while we're looking for something fresh, we're also continually looking to push the envelope of gaming. Thus, we are attempting to play all six volumes of Strange Aeons in just nine months and document the entire journey.</p>

<div class="blurbCenter">
		<a href="/image/content/Blog/20160826-Fog.jpg"><img src="/image/content/Blog/20160826-Fog_180.jpeg" /></a>
		<a href = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20160826-Ambiance.jpg"><img src = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20160826-Ambiance_180.jpeg" /></a>
		<a href = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20160826-Iconics.jpg"><img src = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20160826-Iconics_180.jpeg" /></a>
	</div>

	<p><strong>The Experiment</strong>: What happens when you take four players and one GM who are almost completely ignorant about all things Lovecraft, Elder Mythos, and Cthulhu and send them through Strange Aeons? We're about to find out. In fact, assembling a team of gamers that could marathon often and also meet this criteria was much harder than expected! As with almost all of our campaigns, we're playing iconic characters; knowing that James Jacobs personally selected the four iconics, we decided to play those exact four.</p>

	<p>A long weekend was blocked out for our run of <a href = "/store/v5748btpy9k5o">"In Search of Sanity."</a> When we arrived at the marathon location, our GM had the fog machines set up and our anticipation grew. To best immerse ourselves in an asylum lit by lanterns and candles, we played only by candlelight for the entire 44-hour marathon. We also tapped a fifth member for a cameo as Winter Klaczka, the main NPC.</p>

	<p>Going in, our history with Wes Schneider's writing was a storied one. He took down one of our favorite campaigns back in '09 when we TPKed while attempting <a href = "/products/btpy7ns8">"The Blackguard's Revenge."</a> Two years ago, we were a few rooms inside his magma level in the <a href = "/products/btpy8yqx">Emerald Spire</a>, when Wes took down our paladin with a caustic stalker and we barely edged out a draw. This being our third Schneider module, we had a strong desire to even-up the score.</p>

	<div class = "blurb180">

		<a href = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20160826-Seance.jpg"><img src = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20160826-Seance_180.jpeg" /></a>

	</div>

	<h2>Highlights From <a href = "/store/v5748btpy9k5o">"In Search of Sanity"</a></h2>
	<ul>
		<li>We're not sure what <a href = "/store/byCompany/c/chaosium/byProductType/roleplayingGames/callOfCthulhu"><em>Call of Cthulhu</em></a> is like, but we found ourselves one part scared, one part challenged by combat, and one part just plain freaked out. In a battle for a 4,000 sq. ft library, we faced off against ratlings skittering atop towering bookcases. On the first two rounds, our starknife, dart, and dagger found their marks, disrupting all 3 summon swarms. In this trial the ratlings were modified to throw anything, and they certainly threw the books at us.</li>
		<li>Our RPG skills were tested from every angle. Between a doppelganger infiltration, the worst dreams our characters have ever had, and six diseases active in the party at one time, we were just relieved to survive this cerebral horror film.</li>
		<li>Our GM reflected that being Lovecraft-ignorant was actually fresh and inspiring, and he had trouble remembering an adventure with so many new facets.</li>
		<li>In the finale, "Enter Sandman" blasted as we faced our worst nightmare-become-reality in the Tatterman. Erasmus stepped up with our best chance: <em>Red Destiny</em>, a magical sword now treated with <em>silversheen</em> and good-aligned. Not one, but two confirmed criticals made short work of a foe that is sure to flay his share of parties that come after us.</li>
		<li>The Amber Die was used sparingly, but showed its approval for <a href = "/pathfinder/adventurePath/strangeAeons">Strange Aeons</a> by delivering a natural 20 on the first attack roll of the campaign, followed by a signature 20-20 in the final hours.</li>
	</ul>

	<div class = "blurbCenter">
		<a href = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20160826-Map.jpg"><img src = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20160826-Map_180.jpeg" /></a>
		<a href = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20160826-Map3D.jpg"><img src = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20160826-Map3D_180.jpeg" /></a>
</div>

	<h2>Character Deaths</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>"Dr. Latchke," a crafty doppelganger who got around our Sense Motive, attacked the party from behind while they were distracted with a haunt. One critical hit from a claw left Erasmus depending on the champion spirit of his sister, Nissa, to guide his fighting retreat—yet the asylum's collapsed walls left the medium no choice but to leave his mortal body behind.</li>
		<li>4 iconics with poor Fortitude saves. 3 Ghouls. 9 attacks. 1 missed save. Coup de grace. RIP Quinn.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Best Quote From Marathon 1</h2>
	<blockquote>
	<em>Erasmus</em>: "Ignore the sounds in the fog, my friends, they are fear incarnate."<br />
	<em>Feiya</em>: "I thought we met fear incarnate last night?"
	</blockquote>

	<h2>Current Situation</h2>
	<p>Despite two character deaths, our party remains strong and we secured a win. The reanimated medium archetype allowed us to welcome Erasmus back, and Quinn's raise dead is first on our to-do list. We're doing fairly well on XP, and while our treasury will take a hit, we do have some magic items left. We're hoping we can convince Winter Klaczka to join us for module two, as she would make an excellent addition to the roster. Oh yeah, and Wes: we're tied.</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline">The Last Pathfinder's Journal</h1>
<p class="date">Thursday, August 25, 2016</p>

<div itemprop="articleBody">

<p itemprop="description">The year was 2007. The <em>Dungeon</em> and <em>Dragon</em> magazine license had just ended, and all of us in the Editorial Pit were sweating bullets over this new baby called <a href = "/pathfinder/adventurePath">Pathfinder Adventure Path</a>&mdash;a baby that was going to need to grow up and get a job quick so that we could all keep paying rent. The first volume had already been put to bed, and we were trying to figure out what to do going forward with this section we'd put in the back called the Pathfinder's Journal. The first volume had featured an overview of the Pathfinder Society, written by Erik Mona, but now we were thinking about Ed Greenwood's old Volo's Guides and wondering if maybe this section could be a chance for us to introduce some fun first-person, journal-style adventure fiction to help show off our new campaign setting. We had a half-empty map of Varisia, a handful of proper nouns, and a couple of characters name-dropped in the first article&mdash;Pathfinder Eando Kline and Venture-Captain Shevala. What more did we need?</p>

<p>Since we were short on time, Jason Bulmahn and I wrote the second and third entries simultaneously. I'd published a few short stories other places, but I was still nervous as I turned mine in&mdash;a story called "Hand of the Handless," set in a mostly unknown little city called Kaer Maga. A few days later, Wes Schneider and James Jacobs took me aside and told me that not only were they cool with my story, they were putting me in charge of the section. From that moment forward, I'd be the steward of the continuing adventures of Eando Kline, hiring the best authors I could find and helping them showcase the world of Golarion. I was twenty-three years old.</p>

<div class="blurb180"><a href="/image/content/SecondDarkness/PZO9018-EandoKline.jpg"><img src="/image/content/SecondDarkness/PZO9018-EandoKline_180.jpeg"></a><br /><i>Illustration by Jason Engle</i></div>

<p>Over the next seven years, the Pathfinder's Journal and I grew together. Somewhere around the start of <a href = "/pathfinder/adventurePath/curseOfTheCrimsonThrone">Curse of the Crimson Throne</a>, we realized that Eando's adventures ought to have a point, and the grand arc we crafted took three whole adventure paths to complete. This odyssey was eventually compiled as <a href = "/products/btpy8k9k"><em>The Compass Stone</em></a>, and from there we gave Eando his well-deserved rest (or rebellion) and moved on to having authors write entire six-part novellas in each AP, including folks like Dave Gross, Elaine Cunningham, Wes Schneider, and more. A few years ago, as my job responsibilities started to include more and more management, I handed the journal off to Senior Editor Chris Carey and Developer Adam Daigle, who took the torch and ran with it.</p>

<p>I can't explain how important the journal has been to us, and especially to me. It was the constant process of developing&mdash;and often writing&mdash;chapters of those early journals that eventually convinced me I might have what it took to write a novel, and I know I wasn't the only one that learned from it. The <a href = "/pathfinder/tales">Pathfinder Tales</a> novel line grew directly out of the success of the journal, and it's no surprise that many authors&mdash;and even characters like Dave Gross's Varian and Radovan&mdash;leapt straight from journal to novels, with great aplomb.Yet probably the biggest impact the journal had was on the setting. In those early days, we were still building the Inner Sea region with every story, and tons of iconic characters and locations first saw the light of day there. It's where we learned about bloatmages and orc warbeasts, where we met Shoanti burn riders and Urglin gladiators and heard a serpentfolk's telepathic speech in our heads.</p>

<p>And now, almost a decade later, we're bringing it to a close. Starting with <a href = "/products/btpy9npj">Pathfinder Adventure Path #115</a>, the first of the <a href = "/pathfinder/adventurePath/ironfangInvasion">Ironfang Invasion</a> volumes, we'll be retiring the Pathfinder's Journal. (Fun fact: We were actually going to retire the section half a year earlier, then realized we'd be kicking ourselves forever if we didn't take the chance to let six different authors write six Lovecraftian stories!) The reasons for retirement are many, but in the end, it comes down to the fact that we just don't need it anymore. The journal was always about seeing Golarion through the eyes of its residents, rather than the omniscient overview of a GM. Today, we have the Pathfinder Tales novel line, with far more space in which to bring you the best stories, the most vibrant character, and the most detailed locations. It's the Pathfinder's Journal all grown up.</p>

<p>So what's going to be taking the Journal's place? In short: more! More and longer backmatter articles! Longer adventures! More monsters! More of all the material Pathfinder Adventure Path already provides to help you run your game. It's not my place to spoil what Crystal's got in store for you, but from what I've overheard the developers giggling about, it's going to be awesome. And for those readers who miss the fiction&mdash;come on over to <a href = "/pathfinder/tales">the Pathfinder Tales section</a> and let us hook you up.</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone who's read the journal all these years. We wouldn't be who we are without it&mdash;and without all of you.</p>

<p>Hey there! Josh Vogt speaking... er... typing. I hate to interrupt your regularly scheduled Pathfinder Tales blog post that James Sutter usually provides, but he's so focused on Starfinder these days that I think I can steal his slot without him noticing until it's too late... </p>

<div class="blurb180"><a href="/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8534-Jendara.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8534-Jendara_180.jpeg"></a><br />

<p itemprop="description">If you ever get the chance to meet Wendy Wagner in person, you'll likely come away a little dazzled by the joyful energy she projects. It's practically impossible to not to get swept up in her enthusiasm about any topic you happen to latch on to, be it a favorite recipe or a fantastic horror flick. Whatever the project, Wendy is sure to bring a real passion to it.</p>

<p>The thing is, this same energy comes through in her writing. In her first Pathfinder Tales novel, <a href = "/products/btpy94r1"><em>Skinwalkers</em></a>, Wendy introduced us to Jendara, an ex-pirate who'd given up her marauding ways to try and raise her son. However, raids by a brutal clan of shapeshifters threatens the safety of her island home, and Jendara must use her wits and axe-wielding prowess to defend those she cares for at all costs.</p>

<p>Reading <em>Skinwalkers</em> made me realize I'd never want to get into a cage match with Wendy, because she refuses to pull a punch. Her characters feel incredibly vibrant and alive. Her action scenes leave you breathless. Her descriptions can be brutally detailed (did I mention her penchant for horror, both subtle and shocking?). So when I heard that Wendy would be tackling another Pathfinder Tales novel, <a href = "/products/btpy9j5o"><em>Starspawn</em></a>, I was thoroughly excited, even before I found out the premise would be... </p>

<p>Vikings versus Cthulhu.</p>

<p>Vikings. Versus. Cthulhu.</p>

<p>I mean, come on&mdash;I could practically see Wendy grinning with glee at being able to pit seafaring barbarians against Lovecraftian horrors. And I knew she'd do a smashing job of it, too.</p>

<p>In <em>Starspawn</em>, Jendara returns, and is once more trying to find a measure of peace in life. Yet the stars are aligned against her, and when an unnatural tsunami devastates the area, it leaves a mysterious island in its wake. Strange structures, murderous cultists, and mind-twisting art are just a few of the disturbing elements Jendara and her crew encounter on exploring the new island&mdash;but these are hardly the most terrifying things they'll be forced to face before the end.</p>

<p>So get ready for Wendy to ramp up the adventure, the horror, and the thrills, all while delving into the sanity-skewing intersection of the Elder Mythos and Golarion&mdash;a perfect appetizer to get you in the mood for the new <a href = "/pathfinder/adventurePath/strangeAeons">Strange Aeons Adventure Path</a>. I know I'll be enjoying the adrenaline rush the whole way.</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline">Mummy's Mask and PAX West</h1>

<p class="date">Tuesday, August 22, 2016</p>

<div itemprop = "articlebody">

<p itemprop = "description">We are wrapping up the very final stages of <a href = "/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/mummysMask">Mummy's Mask</a>&mdash;probably the coolest set we've done yet, I don't mind saying&mdash;and it's gotten kind of crazy toward the end. The stuff we've gone back and forth with Vic on... well, let me tell you, when he says "I have no idea how to do that" <i>more than once in a day</i>, you know you're blazing some new ground.</p>

<p>This past week, we found that in Adventure 3 alone, there were no less than three scenarios which functioned like nothing else we've ever made. We rebuilt each of them multiple times, watching cards hop from place to place in manners they've never hopped before. We had to build new tech just for <i>reading</i> cards.</p>

<p>But those are done, and now we're debating the finer points of Adventures 4 through 6. Those adventures use a brand new type of support card called Defensive Stance that required us to actually <i>pull it off the printing press</i> because we found a new wrinkle in it. When we turn the light off on the set in a few weeks, we'll know we've left something great for you to play with. Liz Spain will get you an adventuresome preview next month.</p>

<p>A lot of folks at Gen Con got a first look at some of <a href = "/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/mummysMask">Mummy's Mask</a>'s subtler aspects, and the response was overwhelmingly positive. So we'll be bringing it to our biggest hometown convention, Seattle's <a href = "http://west.paxsite.com" target = "_blank">PAX West</a>, on September 2 through 5. In rooms 201 and 203 of the Washington State Convention Center, Organized Play Coordinator Tonya Woldridge's <a href = "/pfsacg">Adventure Card Guild</a> team will lead folks through Season of the Runelords and Season of the Goblin as well. We might even have a new Class Deck or two to show off.</p>

<p>If you want to hang with the PACG design crew, you'll find all of us on the 6th floor in the Lone Shark booth, #7505. We'll be running some of our new games, signing PACG cards, and drinking the iced lattes that you bring us. Wait, did I say that out loud?</p>

<p>If you're really into finding out what the Lone Shark crew thinks, drop in on a developer conference I help run called <a href = "http://dev.paxsite.com" target = "_blank">PAX Dev</a>, which is on Wednesday and Thursday before PAX West. I'll be giving a talk on Creating a Game Genre, which will unsurprisingly focus on PACG and the other games in that vein. Liz will run a discussion on dog (and gamer) psychology, Paul will talk about designing for other people's properties, and I'll deconstruct Kickstarters with Kickstarter's Luke Crane. You might also enjoy our head-to-head PAX West panel called Mike and Luke Nuke the Apocalypse, where Luke will take the "anti-apocalypse" side and I will take the "pro-apocalypse" side. (Protip: It is never smart to take the "pro-apocalypse" side in any argument.)</p>

<p>So it'll be a full week for the Lone Shark and Paizo crews at the PAXes. Come play with us!</p>

<p itemprop="description">Ever since finishing the sanctioning documents for the <a href = "/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lidu">Giantslayer and Iron Gods</a> Adventure Paths back in January, Linda and I have had our hands full preparing for PaizoCon and Gen Con.

I've been wrangling authors, outlining a bunch of new scenarios, and sending out new assignments; keep an eye out for new product pages soon (and see below for a list of upcoming scenarios, should you need information for planning upcoming conventions).</p>

<b>Upcoming Scenarios</b> <input type="button" value="Show" class="spoilerButton" onclick="toggleSpoiler(this)"><div class="spoiler-text">
<ul><li><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-04: Wardens of Sulfur Gulch (Tier 7-11)</em></li>

</div></div>

<p>Together, though, we're sanctioning a massive number of Modules and Adventure Paths. Today I'd like to share the first of many: <a href = "/products/btpy9grq"><em>Pathfinder Module: Feast of Dust</em></a> and <a href = "/products/btpy9jbf"><em>Pathfinder Module: Ire of the Storm</em></a>! You can find the sanctioning documents on their respective product pages.</p>

<i>Illustrations by Tomasz Chistowski and Sally Gottschalk</i></div>

<p><em>Ire of the Storm</em> skipped ahead in line a bit largely because we want to prioritize sanctioning low-level material in the organized play campaign. Don't worry though, as we're busily looking ahead to <a href = "/products/btpy9grs"><em>The House on Hook Street</em></a>, <a href = "/products/btpy9j6u"><em>Down the Blighted Path</em></a>, and <a href = "/products/btpy9nfu"><em>Gallows of Madness</em></a>. We've also queued the Adventure Paths <a href = "/pathfinder/adventurePath/hellsRebels">Hell's Rebels</a>, <a href = "/pathfinder/adventurePath/curseOfTheCrimsonThrone">Curse of the Crimson Throne</a>, and <a href = "/pathfinder/adventurePath/strangeAeons">Strange Aeons</a> for attention, and after those, <a href = "/pathfinder/adventurePath/serpentsSkull">Serpent's Skull</a>, <a href = "/pathfinder/adventurePath/kingmaker">Kingmaker</a>, and <a href = "/pathfinder/adventurePath/councilOfThieves">Council of Thieves</a> are all eagerly waiting their turns to provide hundreds of hours of additional content to the campaign. At this point, we haven't dug into <a href = "/pathfinder/adventurePath/hellsVengeance">Hell's Vengeance</a> deeply enough to know quite if or how it might fit into the <a href = "/pathfinderSociety">Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild</a>; if anything, it'll likely be one we sanction in "campaign mode" only. Finally, I have the pleasure of reading more <a href = "/pathfinder/tales/novels">Pathfinder Tales novels</a> and have nearly finished <a href = "/products/btpy9e45"><em>Hellknight</em></a>, meaning I'm almost done writing the Volume 8 sanctioning Chronicle sheet.</p>

<p>That covers a lot of what's currently missing, but it does leave out one noteworthy absence: the Pathfinder Society Open Call. You may have noticed that we have a new Pathfinder Society landing page and that much of our campaign information got rearranged just before Gen Con. I'm taking this as an opportunity to revise the Open Call guidelines and add in some more advice I've learned from looking over past entries. My projection is that it will still be a 2,000-word (or less) quest, so if you're in the middle of preparing your own submission based on past guidelines, it's fairly unlikely you'll need to make any significant changes. I do, however, advise not sending in new submissions during this short hiatus, as I'll be reading any submissions I've received since August 1, 2016 with these new guidelines in mind. Once the Open Call is all spruced up, expect to see a blog announcing that it's back in action.</p>

<p class="date">Friday, August 19, 2016</p>

<div itemprop="articlebody">

<p itemprop="description">The bulk of the convention season is behind us, and it's time to jump back aboard the weekly <a href = "/pathfinderbattles">Pathfinder Battles</a> preview train! And I've got to say, Gen Con was just the thing to re-ignite my excitement about the product line and all of the amazing stuff we have coming out in the next year or so! Before we get into this week's <a href = "/products/btpy9kcu"><em>Deadly Foes</em></a> preview, please allow me to list a few items that are stirring my excitement, including some behind-the-scenes stuff you might not be aware of!</p>

<ol><li><a href = "/products/btpy9kcu"><em>Deadly Foes</em></a>, now scheduled for a November release, is shaping up to be one of our best sets yet. We've approved ALL of the paint masters for the set, the packaging is finished, and we're into production as I write this. While I have not yet seen final production figures from the run, everything I've seen for <a href = "/products/btpy9kcu"><em>Deadly Foes</em></a> makes me even more excited about the set than I've previously been, which is really saying something. From the digital sculpts to figure selection to the paint masters, everything has gone "right" with this set, and I can't wait to see the final product in hand.</li>
<li>While waiting at the Indianapolis airport upon my attempted escape from Indiana on the ill-fated day of the Deltapocalypse, our friends at WizKids provided about two-thirds of the digital sculpts from the next set, entitled I CAN'T TELL YOU YET, and holy moley, there was so much coolness packed into that set that I didn't even mind being delayed by seven hours, so fueled was I with overwhelming awesomeness. I barely had any corrections or comments for this batch, and all of the fellow Paizonians I fanatically showed the images to while they also waited to board their planes agreed with my assessment. Some of the very best <a href = "/pathfinderbattles">Pathfinder Battles</a> figures are yet to come. The multi-figure "themes" in the next set are REALLY strong, and I think folks are really going to dig them.</li>
<li>Speaking of the next (secret) set, I can confirm that the case incentive is EXTREMELY SPECIAL, and unlike anything we've done previously. Not totally unlike what we've done before, but definitely bigger and better. There will be more value packed into this incentive than in any of our previous sets, and now that I've seen some of the sculpts associated with it... man. So, so cool.</li>
<li>While at Gen Con, I had a chance to meet with WizKids, and I'm happy to report that based on that discussion I'm now at work building the NEXT setlist, which should cover us through all of 2017 insofar as big sets are concerned. This set, too, will have an unprecedented and completely awesome Case Incentive featuring something people have been asking for for a long time. The line is healthy and we're moving forward full steam ahead!</li>
<li>Lastly, I'm super excited to welcome back to the Paizo family Mr. Mike Kenway, our former Licensing Coordinator, who returns to Paizo after a year in the wilderness as our Director of Licensing. Mike will return to helping me out on setlists, approvals, and reference coordination, which will be an enormous boon. Mike has worked on nearly every <a href = "/pathfinderbattles">Pathfinder Battles</a> set, and bringing him back onto the team frees me up to push the envelope conceptually even further. A team of two is much, much better (and much more efficient) than just little old me doing nearly everything (on the Paizo side, anyway) by myself, and I speak for the entire Paizo team when I say: "Welcome back, Mike!"</li></ol>

<p>So with all of that great news out of the way, let's take a look at three figures from November's <a href = "/products/btpy9kcu"><em>Deadly Foes</em></a> set!</p>

<div class="blurbCenter"><a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160819-CaveCatcher.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160819-CaveCatcher_360.jpeg"></a></div>

<p>First up this week is the nasty Cave Catcher, a sneaky subterranean hunter who ensnares adventurers with its sticky tongue. This Medium, uncommon figure is sure to menace your player characters, and at the uncommon rarity, why not pit your heroes against a small clutch of the creatures?</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160819-CaveGiant.jpg"><img src = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160819-CaveGiant_360.jpeg"></a></div>

<p>Want something larger for your cavern adventures? How about <a href = "/products/btpy8odu"><em>Bestiary 3</em></a>'s Cave Giant? These monstrous brutes dwell in caves, where they make slaves of lesser creatures like dwarves, orcs, troglodytes, and player characters. Wielding a massive bone battleaxe and clad in filthy hide, the Cave Giant makes a perfect addition to the ranks of <a href = "/pathfinderbattles">Pathfinder Battles</a> giants we've produced to date. The Cave Giant is a Large, uncommon figure.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160819-HouseDrake.jpg"><img src = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160819-HouseDrake_360.jpeg"></a></div>

<p>Last up this week is the delightful little House Drake, which appears under a different name on page 229 of the <a href = "/products/btpy8auu"><em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</em></a>. This deadly creature packs impressive power into its small (actually Tiny) frame. Perfect as either an improved familiar, a mischievous opponent, or even the child of a larger dragon figure, the House Drake is a rare figure on a Small base.</p>

<p>And that's it for this week! It was great to chat minis with a few of you at Gen Con, and I look forward to our paths crossing again!</p>

<p>Until then, I remain...</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline">Gen Con and Thanks for All the Fish</h1>

<p class="date">Tuesday, August 16, 2016</p>

<div itemprop = "articlebody">

<p itemprop = "description">Gen Con 2016 is in the books (and Delta's computer failure gave me and many other Paizonians a lovely bonus day or two in the fabulous airport waiting areas of Atlanta, Chicago, Detroit, Indianapolis, Minneapolis-St. Paul, and/or Salt Lake City) and what a show it was! Demos of the upcoming <a href = "/products/btpy9mbg"><em>Mummy's Mask Base Set</em></a> were a huge hit in the exhibit hall, with 10 tables of action running basically at capacity for four straight days. Many thanks to Dominick Trascritti and his skilled demo team for giving fans old and new an excellent introduction to Mummy's Mask.</p>

<p>Action in the Sagamore Ballroom was also hopping, with the <a href = "/pfsacg">Adventure Card Guild</a> area serving up more tables of Pathfinder Society Adventure Card Guild play than ever before. We showcased the epic final adventures of Season of the Runelords. We debuted the insane Season of the Goblins, written by Tyler Beck, David Jacobson, and Keith Richmond... and let's just say that people were not expecting to eat that many slugs. (For those of you who didn't make it to Gen Con, these adventures will be available for sale soon!)</p>

<p>We debuted a multimodal special event, <a href = "/products/btpy9mbe"><em>The Cosmic Captive</em></a>, mixing RPG and ACG tables to great effect. We got a ton of great feedback on how to improve the ACG side of future such events, so thank you all for being our guinea pigs on that. Venture-Lieutenant Kevin Hanley and his phenomenal volunteer staff did a spectacular job marshaling and managing the area, as well as the trial by fire that was running multiple tables simultaneously. (The Cosmic Captive will be available exclusively to conventions for the next year.) It was a privilege and a pleasure to work with so many enthusiastic and talented Pathfinder Society folk this year. (To my Special GMs: <i>JUMP</i>!)</p>

<p>We also brought back the ACG Open for a second year, to the delight and chagrin of dedicated players. This year's tournament, "The Cayden Cailean Way," took 64 players through a variety of tests in honor of the Lucky Drunk. In case you need to be terrified, this year's event had rounds written by Chad Brown, Keith Richmond, and Mike Selinker, with a little synthesis done by yours truly. The final round featured last year's runner-up team, Level 5, against an upstart team of pick-up players called Team One. Both teams completed the final scenario within one minute of each other, but Team One won the day with a higher overall score. Level 5, I am rooting for you to level up next year!</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20160816-Photo1.jpg"><img src = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20160816-Photo1_360.jpeg"></a>

<i>The 2016 Adventure Card Game Open finalists.</i></div>

<p>This year's Gen Con (my nineteenth, yipes!) was bittersweet for me, because it marked an ending and a beginning for me. I'm starting a new adventure this fall: nursing school. Unfortunately, the demands of school and the demands of ACG players are a little too much to handle at once, so I'm bidding farewell to Paizo's hallowed halls. I leave the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game in the capable hands of Vic and the Sharks, and the Adventure Card Guild in the capable hands of Organized Play Coordinator Tonya Woldridge. Being a member of the ACG and Pathfinder Society teams has been a joy, and I couldn't ask for better stewards.</p>

<p>Thank you all for allowing me to strain your brains and add fun to your days with the Class Decks and the Adventure Card Guild. I've really enjoyed doing it, and I look forward to playing with you all at a convention soon. Onward to adventure!</p>

<p>Huge congratulations to the team of volunteers that worked diligently through Gen Con. From Leads Bob Jonquet, Jon Cary, and Todd Morgan to Department Heads Bobby Harring, Dominick Trascritti, Kevin Hanley, Lucas Servideo, Seth Brummond, and Walter Sheppard to the hundreds of GMs and HQ volunteers. My deepest thanks to everyone that contributed from set up to tear down to bring the show together. There is no way to run an event the size of Gen Con without many hands. Thank you to all who gave of their time so that others may play in the world's largest organized play campaign!</p>

<h2>Campaign Coins</h2>
<p>It was my immense pleasure to award a number of campaign coins at PaizoCon UK and Gen Con. Each recipient spent hours of their time serving our campaign, giving of their time and talents. As with the Gen Con volunteers, our campaign would not run without their selflessness. A huge huzzah and congratulations to the following:
<ul>

<h2>Order of the Wayfinder</h2>
<p>Several months back, I wrote a blog on volunteerism and what the Campaign Coins meant to me. Some of our most outstanding volunteers received their coins in prior years. Thus, the formation of the Order of the Wayfinder, an award above the Campaign Coin with which the Pathfinder Society team may recognize those volunteers whose service goes above and beyond and without whom it would be impossible to run the Society. The premier inductee of the Order is <strong>Bob Jonquet</strong>, whom I many never thank enough for his tireless hours as Regional Venture Captain and Gen Con lead. Any hour of the day, whatever the issue we need assistance with, he is there to help and support. To Bob, our deepest thanks and appreciation. Congratulations!</p>

<h2>Five Star GMs</h2>
<p>Several game masters reached their 5-star milestone over the past few weeks. These GMs dedicate hours to the game, running 150 sessions, 50 of which must be different scenarios, and 10 special events. The time commitment that goes into preparing and delivering games deserves a cheer and a round of applause!

<h2>Guide Revisions</h2>

<div class="blurb180" style="float: left;">
<img src="/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PFS-StolenStorm_180.jpeg" />
</div>

<p>As many of you who read the <a href = "/products/btpy84k4" target = "_new">new Roleplaying Guild Guide</a> noticed, the formatting changed quite a bit, and a few new rules found their way in as well. These new rules received mixed reviews, and specifically, applying credit from playing a pregenerated character. As with other initiatives and programs, I am open to feedback on how they work in the field, and as with other initiatives, I will revisit them in six months to see how they are working. Constructive feedback based on observation will help us the most, and we know that not all of our decisions will please everybody, but this was an issue that needed addressing.</p>

<p>Another change in the <a href = "/products/btpy84k4" target = "_new">Roleplaying Guild Guide</a> involves the Pathfinder Society Community Policy. The goal of the policy is to create an inclusive environment for our players while leaving options open for communities to have the flavor of Pathfinder Society that they desire. The new policy puts the burden of good behavior on each individual player, with consequences for players not interested in fostering a community spirit. It also puts weight on the GM to regulate the table and ensure that no one is being excluded from play. So if you want to play edgier concepts, recognize the time and place for them. A public venue with new players may not be the right time to bring out the man-hating cleric of Calistra, elf supremacist, or Zarta Dralneen's newest enthusiast—save those characters for a private game with people you know. "My character would act that way" is not an excuse to abuse other Pathfinders, and when choosing which character to play, consider your environment and the other players at your table and select appropriately.</p>

<p>With the inclusion of a more defined community behavior policy, we are rescinding the limitation on slaver and torturer professions. This does not lift the restriction on Pathfinders purchasing slaves. The reason for this inclusion in the campaign is that they are an ingrained part of the economy (slaver) and religious observance for Kuthonites (torturer). Again, as with other changes to the campaign, please send feedback and let me know how this is working in your area. If it becomes evident players are not able to have this content and treat it in a responsible manner, then it will once again be removed and offending players subject to disciplinary action.</p>

<a href = "http://west.paxsite.com/" target = "_blank"><h2>PAX West</h2></a>
<p>If you're in the Seattle area over the Labor Day weekend and attending the show on September 2nd to 5th, please stop by and say hi! And if you'd like to volunteer for us at the show for either the Roleplaying Game Guild or the Adventure Card Guild, send me an email and I will pass it onto the leads (Louis Manko Levite or Stacey Buxton).</p>

<p>I hope everyone is getting a chance to wrap up <a href = "/pathfinderSocietyScenarios/season7">Year of the Serpent</a> and get ready to ride the tempest that is <a href = "/pathfinderSocietyScenarios/season8">Year of the Stolen Storm</a>!</p>

<p>Until next week—explore, report, cooperate!</p>

<p>Tonya Woldridge<br />
<em>Organized Play Coordinator</em></p>

<h1 itemprop="headline">The Stars Are Right</h1>
<p class="date">Wednesday, August 10, 2016</p>

<div itemprop="articlebody">

<p>Dear Reader,</p>

<p itemprop="description">The light from Aldebaran and the songs from the Hyades fall upon our brittle planet, and I'm pleased to share with you that in the coming weeks the <a href = "/pathfinder/adventurePath/strangeAeons">Strange Aeons Adventure Path</a> will be slinking out of our warehouse and making its way into game stores, distributors' warehouses, and your homes. After much research and many an occult ritual, this Adventure Path steeped in the cosmic horror of the Elder Mythos has broken free from the Dreamlands and become a reality&mdash;a sentient thing, perhaps.</p>

<p>Now, this is no reason for concern. I assure you that the Strange Aeons Adventure Path is fairly benign. You will not go mad from reading it; the books won't flap themselves from your shelf and scuttle about your home in the stygian hours of the night while you slumber&mdash;dreaming of things far more horrific, no doubt. It will, however, provide hours and hours of creepy excitement for you and your friends.</p>

<div class="blurbCenter"><a href="/image/content/PathfinderAdventurePath/PZO90110-HasturOpener.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderAdventurePath/PZO90110-HasturOpener_500.jpeg"></a><br />

<p>While this Adventure Path is perfect for experts on the Lovecraft Mythos, don't feel like Strange Aeons isn't for you if you're not familiar with or well versed in the literature that provides the inspiration for this campaign. If you enjoy creepy cultists, bizarre monsters, forgotten lore, and accursed locations, Strange Aeons is a good fit for you.</p>

<p>I will, however, bestow upon you a small warning that this campaign starts off in an atypical way, perhaps our most non-standard Adventure Path opening to date. The characters wake up in an asylum with no memory of how they got there and only hazy recollections of who they are. This kind of start requires a fair amount of trust of the GM and of the Adventure Path. You can still create a character with a complete backstory, but know that some things happened in your character's past that are beyond his or her control. The upcoming Strange Aeons Player's Guide provides advice on how to make the best of this strange (but fun) situation.</p>

<p>If you are eager to play through or run the Strange Aeons and want to gather some associated materials to help spice up your campaign, consider checking out some of the following items. As this is a cosmic horror campaign, picking up the newly released <a href = "/products/btpy9n5a"><em>Pathfinder RPG Horror Adventures</em></a> is a great idea. In addition to great advice on running horror games, the book provides plenty of great character options for GMs and players both. I also advise using the new alternate fear rules included in this book, as I feel it will really help set the mood for the campaign. Similarly, grabbing a copy of <a href = "/products/btpy9egu"><em>Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures</em></a> provides plenty of character options and new rules that fit the tone and flavor of the Strange Aeons Adventure Path.</p>

<div class = "blurb180"><a href = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderAdventurePath/PZO90110-StarStele.jpg"><img src = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderAdventurePath/PZO90110-StarStele_180.jpeg"></a><br />
<i>Illustration by Ramon Puasa Jr.</i></div>

<p>Strange Aeons kicks off with <a href = "/products/btpy9nry"><em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #109: In Search of Sanity</em></a> by our own Editor-In-Chief F. Wesley Schneider, who puts his own brand of horror on the Adventure Path right out of the gate. I cornered him in his office and got him to jot down a few thoughts about his opening adventure.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"As soon as it was clear that we were returning to Ustalav, I was pretty vocal that I wanted in. <a href = "/products/btpy8j5u"><em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Rule of Fear</em></a> established Versex county as Lovecraft country, and Thrushmoor already had dozens of threads dangling for cosmic horror plots, so I was instantly stoked that Strange Aeons was going to be playing in that sandbox. The fact that the first adventure was set in an asylum was just icing on a really big pile of also icing (I might have written a couple of fictional asylums in past works).</p>

<p>Now, it's been nearly a year since I wrapped up work on In Search of Sanity. I wrote it on something of a binge after finishing my novel, <a href = "/products/btpy9e43"><em>Pathfinder Tales: Bloodbound</em></a> (also set in Ustalav), and the first volume of Hell's Vengeance, <a href = "/products/btpy9j6n">"The Hellfire Compact."</a> As a result, "In Search of Sanity" features as few subtle nods to both. I won't give away too much, but if you're interested in learning more about Ustalav's royal accusers or about the tribulations of Longacre's Lieklan family, the first Strange Aeons has more to say.</p>

<p>You'll also have the chance to join an asylum revolt, surf a blood tsunami and give a ghoul a shower.</p>

<p>I seem to remember that some Lovecrafty stuff happens too.</p>

<p>Y'all like bholes, right?"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you're eager to get into the right feel for Strange Aeons and want to do some reading, I've compiled a brief reading list of some of the stories that capture the feel of and have inspired the Strange Aeons Adventure Path.</p>

<ul><li>"The Shadow Out of Time," by H. P. Lovecraft</li>
<li>"The Dunwich Horror," by H. P. Lovecraft</li>
<li>"At the Mountains of Madness," by H. P. Lovecraft</li>
<li>"The Call of Cthulhu," by H. P. Lovecraft</li>
<li>"Dream Quest of Unknown Kadath," by H. P. Lovecraft</li>
<li>"The Doom that Came to Sarnath," by H. P. Lovecraft</li>
<li>"The Repairer of Reputations," by Robert Chambers</li>
<li>"The Yellow Sign," by Robert Chambers</li>
<li>"The Great God Pan," by Arthur Machen</li>
<li>"The Wendigo," by Algernon Blackwood</li>
<li>"The Willows," by Algernon Blackwood</li>
<li>"The House on the Borderland," by William Hope Hodgson</li></ul>

<p>In a few short weeks the ritual to properly summon the <a href = "/pathfinder/adventurePath/strangeAeons">Strange Aeons Adventure Path</a> will be complete! Keep your eyes on this blog for the Strange Aeons Player's Guide, which you will see soon enough.</p>

<p itemprop = "description">Players who joined us <a href = "/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lj06">last week at Gen Con</a> had an early opportunity to play the Gunslinger, but for those who missed the mayhem, I'm here to deliver everything you need to know about the <a href = "/products/btpy9ipq"><em>Gunslinger Class Deck</em></a>.</p>

<p>One of the first steps I took when preparing to work on the Gunslinger deck was to get my research on. I pored through historical documents (internet wiki) as well as the Pathfinder RPG rules with a singular quest: identify all of the guns we could possibly have, then stuff them all in the class deck. You'll have a full array of lower-technology options such as the Matchlock Hackbut, Wheellock Pistol, and Hand Cannon, as well as examples of the higher end of gunsmithing that Alkenstar might have to offer, by way of the Revolver, Shotgun, and Rifle.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6816-HeadCannon.jpg"><img src = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6816-HeadCannon_180.jpeg" /></a><br />
<i>One shot, many kills.</i></div>

<p>Some of you might be wondering about that Alkenstar reference. Alkenstar is a city-state on the border of the Mana Wastes. Having to survive in that harsh magic-dead region, the alchemists and engineers of Alkenstar invented firearms. In fact, the kingdom still controls the supply of firearms to the rest of Golarion, with 90% of the firearms in the world remaining within its borders. All three of the characters in the <em>Gunslinger Class Deck</em> are from Alkenstar.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6816-BlessingOfAlkenstar.jpg"><img src = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6816-BlessingOfAlkenstar_180.jpeg" /></a><br />
<i>Look, ma: no Divine.</i></div>

<p>Some of you might think of our iconic gunslinger Lirianne as a buccaneer, due to her presence in <a href = "/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/skullAndShackles">Skull & Shackles</a>. The Class Deck version of Lirianne focuses more on her <a href = "/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lcfb">history</a> as a shield marshal from Alkenstar that has been flung far from home. Mechanically, she specializes in always having the right gun in hand and making the most of its powers, as well as self-sufficiency to make her a more appealing solo option.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6816-LirianneFront.jpg"><img src = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6816-LirianneFront_360.jpeg" /></a>
<a href = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6816-LirianneMysteriousStranger.jpg"><img src = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6816-LirianneMysteriousStranger_360.jpeg" /></a><br />
<i>There's a reason she has marshal stars on her holsters.</i></div>

<p>Each of the three gunslingers in the deck takes inspiration from one of the Gunslinger archetypes in the RPG. Far from home, Lirianne is now a <a href = "/pathfinderRPG/prd/ultimateCombat/classArchetypes/gunslinger.html#mysterious-stranger-(archetype)">mysterious stranger</a> who roams from adventure to adventure righting wrongs. That inspired me to write a short bit of doggerel (preferably read in your best Sam Elliott impression), which didn't quite fit into the flavor text box for the Mysterious Stranger role card:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>When the bad times come, your life's in danger<br />
Then appears the mysterious stranger<br />
Tip of her hat and six shots of her gun<br />
On to her next stop, 'cause your problem's done.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6816-AngbanFront.jpg"><img src = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6816-AngbanFront_360.jpeg" /></a>
<a href = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6816-AngbanTokenBack.jpg"><img src = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6816-AngbanTokenBack_180.jpeg" /></a><br />
<i>Bring it.</i></div>

<p>Our next gunslinger was inspired by the <a href = "/pathfinderRPG/prd/ultimateCombat/classArchetypes/gunslinger.html#gun-tank-(archetype)">Gun Tank archetype</a>. Angban is a dwarf from Dongun Hold, the dwarven fortress in Alkenstar that invented firearms. He is a master of long guns and armor both, making steady progress against the toughest of foes.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6816-SkizzaFront.jpg"><img src = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6816-SkizzaFront_360.jpeg" /></a>
<a href = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6816-SkizzaTokenBack.jpg"><img src = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/pzo6816_SkizzaTokenBack_180.jpeg" /></a><br />
<i>Oh, it's already been brought'n.</i></div>

<p>The third gunslinger is a ratfolk <a href = "/pathfinderRPG/prd/advancedRaceGuide/featuredRaces/ratfolk.html#gulch-gunner-(gunslinger)">Gulch Gunner</a> whose story is intertwined with Angban's. Both participated gloriously in the Battle of the Warrens, but Skizza's glory has a very different flavor indeed. Skizza is known for his use of bombs and fire, and other alchemical toys. He is tremendously effective, but not the safest of companions.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6816-PoisonedBullets.jpg"><img src = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6816-PoisonedBullets_180.jpeg" /></a>
<a href = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6816-AdamantineBullets.jpg"><img src = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6816-AdamantineBullets_180.jpeg" /></a><br />
<i>Not safe for children. Or Veterans.</i></div>

<p>The class deck includes plenty of new cards, including a new <a href = "/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5liqh">cycle</a>: Ammunition. Like gunslingers in the RPG, card game gunslingers now have the ability to sift through an array of possible options to maximize their shots-to-kill ratios.</p>

<p>Pathfinder really has the most amazing artists, and Gunslinger was the first set in which I personally composed the art order. It was a true high note of my time as a game designer to see the results, so I want to end with callouts to some of my favorite pieces. You can see Ekaterina Burmak's fantastic treatment of Angban above, which delivered on absolutely every detail of my concept and then some. Two other awesome pieces were ally cards done by Suzanne Helmigh:</p>

<a href = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6816-CannonMaster.jpg"><img src = "//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6816-CannonMaster_180.jpeg" /></a><br />

<p>The <em>Gunslinger Class Deck</em> is available August 31.  And if you don't already have a <a href = "/products/btpy9ewj">Class Deck subscription</a>, there's still time to start your sub with <a href = "/products/btpy9jcw"><em>Goblins Fight!</em></a> and <a href = "/products/btpy9ipq"><em>Goblins Burn!</em></a> and get a pile of goblin promo cards alongside them!</p>

In just a short time, the <a href = "/pathfinder/adventurePath/strangeAeons">Strange Aeons Adventure Path</a> will release.

<p itemprop="description">Hi everyone! Writing to you from the Sagamore Ballroom in the Indianapolis Convention Center. Flew in the night before last from the United Kingdom to start setting up for Gen Con, which kicks off this Thursday. Yesterday morning, the Sag was empty, with three lonely pallets of stuff shipped from Paizo home offices. At its busiest, there were 30ish people bustling around, hanging banners, moving tables, and getting the basics set up.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderSociety/20160802-Photo1.jpg"><img src = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderSociety/20160802-Photo1_360.jpeg"></a>

<p>I really enjoyed attending PaizoCon UK. At roughly 180 attendees, it is large enough to offer a good variety of games but small enough to know many of the attendees. Seeing old friends made me smile and I met many lovely new friends. Started pre-convention gaming by running Pathfinder Adventure Card Guild Season of the Runelords, but got pulled away for meetings and left subsequent games in the able hands of con attendees. Over the course of PaizoCon UK, I ran two tables of the retired Third Riddle, joined the Aspis in <em>Serpent's Ire</em>, put my characters social skills to the test in <em>Bid for Alabastrine</em>, and thwarted thieves in <em>The Sun Orchid Scheme</em>. The opportunity engage with players/GMs and interact over Pathfinder Society was delightful and I hope to do so again very soon.</p>

<h2>Roleplaying Guild Guide</h2>
<p>As Year of the Serpent draws to its close and we prepare to launch Season 8: Year of the Stolen Storm, it's time for a new <a href = "/products/btpy84k4"><em>Roleplaying Guild Guide</em></a>! I've given it a final look over now and turned it over to Chris Lambertz to work her magic and get it uploaded. Those familiar with past guides will note this the reworked format. It is designed so that you only access the information you need, with separate chapters for players & GMs. As you use the new guide, please send feedback to the team at <a href = "mailto:pathfindersociety@paizo.com">pathfindersociety@paizo.com</a> on what works well and what you would like to see changed for the next version.</p>

<p>The setup at the Sag is ongoing, the banners slowly transforming the space from plain hall to Pathfinder Society Headquarters. Today, Gen Con leads Jon Cary and Bob Jonquet arrived and we started unloading pallets, building shelving, and emptying boxes. Lead Todd Morgan arrives tomorrow and will assist in putting the final touches on the event. Extra hands are always appreciated, so if you're in Indianapolis and have a few hours, come on by, say "Hi!" and help us set up for the best four days in gaming!</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline">The Pathfinder Adventure Card Game Returns to Gen Con!</h1>

<p class="date">Tuesday, August 2, 2016</p>

<div itemprop = "articlebody">

<p>We're going back to Gen Con, the place the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game made its debut! And boy, do we have some cool stuff for you to see and do.</p>

<p>But before we dive into that, Paizo's kind enough to let me share this: Tanis, Gaby, and I wrote a puzzle novel called <em>The Maze of Games</em> a few years back, and it's featured in a <a href = "https://www.humblebundle.com/books/puzzle-book-bundle" target = "_blank">Humble Puzzle Bundle</a> we're running for <i>one more day</i>. Some of the proceeds go to our favorite charities: the It Gets Better Project, Worldbuilders, and Child's Play. If you like our puzzles and you like ponying up for good causes, pop on over there and take a look.</p>

<p>OK, Gen Con!</p>

<h2>Come See, Hear, and Talk to Us!</h2>

<div class = "blurb180"><a href = "//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/RetaBigbad.jpg"><img src = "//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/RetaBigbad_180.jpeg"></a></div>

<p>You can come see Paizo in booth #300&mdash;we'll be demoing <a href = 
"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/mummysMask">Mummy's Mask</a>, which will be out in October. And a lot of the Lone Shark team will be in booth #2847 showing off the <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OizL5EZMzVM" target = "_blank">Apocrypha</a> adventure card game. If you're an ACG fan, this is the show to be at.</p>

<p>Say you want the signature of some of the designers. My crewmates and I will be signing at the Paizo booth on Sunday from noon to 1 pm. You can also find me and the other designers signing at the Lone Shark booth for an hour on each of the four days; check the schedule at booth #2847. You can get your Reta Bigbad signed!</p>

<p itemprop = "description">There's more Pathfinder ACG to be found in the seminar rooms. Mike and Chad will join Penny Arcade's Mike "Gabe" Krahulik to talk about the evolution of their arc of games, including some discussion of PACG, at the panel Big Co-Op Game: From Betrayal to Thornwatch on Thursday at 1 pm.

Then on Friday at 1 pm, at the Pathfinder & Obsidian Entertainment panel, we'll chat up the digital game and all the cool things to come from that. If you like hearing us talk about things you like, you'll hear us a lot at Gen Con.</p>

<h2>Come Play the Adventure Card Guild With Us!</h2>
<p>The Sagamore Ballroom will have lots of Pathfinder Society Adventure Card Guild games running, including not-yet-released installments of <a href = "/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5liyq">Season of the Runelords</a>. Plus there are three events that are anything but ordinary.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZOACGS02B01.jpg"><img src = "//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZOACGS02B01_180.jpeg"></a></div>

<p>First up: <a href = "http://gencon.highprogrammer.com/gencon-2016.cgi/event/CGM1699620" target = "_blank">Season of the Goblin</a>! (That link is to the first session, but there are about a million others.) You can play characters from the brand-new <a href = "/products/btpy9jcw"><em>Goblins Fight!</em></a> and <a href = "/products/btpy9k5m"><em>Goblins Burn!</em></a> decks if you like, or you can play a character from any other class deck, but&mdash;spoiler alert&mdash;you get turned into a goblin. So if you always wanted to play Seelah without all that do-goodnik attitude, this is your time. Adventure 1 (of 2!) in Season of the Goblin was written by Tyler "Cartmanbeck" Beck, David "Theryon Stormrune" Jacobson, and our own Keith "Keith Richmond" Richmond. It's freakin' bonkers. Go play it at Gen Con.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//static1.paizo.com/image/product/catalog/PZO/PZOACGS0800E.jpg"><img src = "//static1.paizo.com/image/product/catalog/PZO/PZOACGS0800E_180.jpeg"></a></div>

<p>There's a very special tournament called <a href = "http://gencon.highprogrammer.com/gencon-2016.cgi/event/CGM1698008" target = "_blank">The PFS Interactive Special: The Cosmic Captive</a>. This is an idea we've been kicking around for a while: What if we bring together Pathfinder Society Adventure Card Guild players and Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild players in a single cooperative event? And then [redacted] you to [redacted]? Well, you should have heard us snickering about it. If you like either the ACG or the RPG, you'll find this a perfect match for your sublimely good taste in games.</p>

<p>And then there's the <a href = "http://gencon.highprogrammer.com/gencon-2016.cgi/event/CGM1699638" target = "_blank">Pathfinder Society Adventure Card Guild: Gen Con Open Tournament</a>, our competitive battle between teams of PACG players. This year, we have a cunning twist to the format: You don't need to bring a class deck to this one. Instead, we'll give each four-player team four class decks at the start of round one. We're not going to tell you what class decks they are, though I will say that they each have three characters in them. From those four class decks, each player chooses a character, marks it on their team's form, and builds a deck in a limited time. Should that team be lucky enough to make it to round two, they'll get the same four class decks, except this time they can't play any of the four characters they played before. Then if that team makes it to the finals, they have to use the last unused character in each deck. So this is an exercise in careful planning and time management. Also, we aim to kill some characters. Good luck to all the challengers!</p>

<p>Those are our plans for Gen Con. It'll be a wild time and we hope you can join us. See some of you there!</p>
