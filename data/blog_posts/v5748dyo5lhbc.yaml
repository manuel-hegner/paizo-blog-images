  description\">PaizoCon 2013 was a special occasion—and not only because it was my\
  \ first as a Paizo employee. It was also the playtest run of <a href=\"/products/btpy8xki\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Special #5-00: Siege of the Diamond City</em></a> by the\
  \ esteemed <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lfza\">Thurston Hillman</a> (Thursty as\
  \ we often call him), and the two of us had an opportunity to hang out in the hotel\
  \ bar for several hours afterward. At first we spoke about entirely professional\
  \ matters, such as how the playtest went, what changes we would make, and the screams\
  \ of players whose characters foolishly attacked the <b>[REDACTED]</b>. As I have\
  \ learned is typical of our conversations, we gradually meandered into the realm\
  \ of theorycrafting, humorous hypotheticals, and madness.</p> \n     <p>Somehow\
  \ we started talking about a Special to end all Specials—an event so maddeningly\
  \ obnoxious that at least half of all tables would be flipped by the half-way point,\
  \ the author would end the night tarred and feathered, and the Recent Reviews banner\
  \ on paizo.com would be choked with the adventure's 1-star reviews for a week straight.\
  \ Demons were still pretty fresh on our minds, and in an attempt to create a suitably\
  \ kooky yet catchy title, I dubbed it \"Shax's House of Pain,\" named for the demon\
  \ lord of murder, lies, and sadistic torture.</p> \n     <p>We were on a roll that\
  \ evening, and together we detailed at least ten different encounter areas that\
  \ all centered on pulling the rug out from under players, tearing up Chronicle sheets,\
  \ and metagame humor. Several brave souls stuck around for a while as Thursty and\
  \ I spoke with escalating excitement and increasingly frequent falsettos. The shrill\
  \ \"Shax's House of Paaaain!\" became our battle cry for the next 24 hours, and\
  \ we sometimes heard a few others shout it from down the hall. Ever since, I've\
  \ seen it referenced at the weirdest times on the messageboards, and sometimes I\
  \ hear it uttered at conventions.</p> \n     <p>Well, two years ago, Mark Moreland\
  \ and I cooked up a <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lely\">fake blog post about defective\
  \ Chronicle sheets</a> for April Fool's Day, and last year I felt the pressure to\
  \ outdo that somehow. Unfortunately, April 1st fell on a Tuesday, so another blog\
  \ was out of the question. Instead, I decided it was time to up the ante on Thursty's\
  \ and my abyssal creation and grant it the mockery of unlife... by actually assigning\
  \ it.</p> \n     <p>The email used the same format as any official assignment, but\
  \ I tweaked the language to give Thursty a growing sense of its comical disingenuousness.\
  \ For example, it informed him that he would be paid a negative amount of money\
  \ and should expect an invoice from our finance department to sort out how much\
  \ tribute Mr. Hillman owed us for the privilege of writing this piece. It further\
  \ instructed Thursty to tinker with our stat block spreadsheet until it broke (and\
  \ report any issues to Mark Moreland) and advised that his final turnover would\
  \ be due on March 31st, 2014—the day before he even received the outline. As icing\
  \ on the cake, I signed my name by including my dear officemate Mark Moreland's\
  \ email address as the point of contact.</p> \n     <p>Of course, this was just\
  \ some crude rewriting of email boilerplate, and I knew that leaving it at that\
  \ would just elicit a shrug and a halfhearted golf clap. That wouldn't do. Instead\
  \ I dedicated far too much free time to writing up a full assignment outline, which\
  \ I have reprinted here (minus a bit of unnecessary introduction that spoils part\
  \ of Season 5).</p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p><em>Shax's House of Pain</em>\
  \ is a Pathfinder Society Exclusive scenario for 5th- to 9th-level characters. It\
  \ provides characters an opportunity to cry their own bodyweight in tears and contributes\
  \ to the ongoing Decemvirate faction metaplot.</p> \n      <h2>Adventure (30,000-40,000\
  \ words)</h2> \n      <p>... In fact, Shax, lord of lies, envy, and particularly\
  \ violent murder, has worked from the shadows to ensure that the Pathfinder Society\
  \ dies horribly in its final showdown with his disciple Tancred Desimire. Thinking\
  \ themselves clever, Pathfinder agents studied Desimire's diaries and spelled out\
  \ a hidden message by erasing all but prime-numbered letters, reversing their order,\
  \ and then translating the new message into Aklo with a poorly written bilingual\
  \ dictionary.</p> \n      <p>Master of Scrolls Kreighton Shaine gathers the PCs\
  \ in the Grand Lodge to perform a counter-ritual to foil Desimire's plans, but upon\
  \ beginning the rite, Shaine accidentally remarks that he is hungry and would appreciate\
  \ a sandwich. The admission flings the PCs into the Abyss (no saving throw), specifically\
  \ into the depths of Charnelhome, Shax's abyssal realm. They land in between two\
  \ massive slices of whole wheat toast on top of a table made of fiendish spider\
  \ swarms being used for a demonic tea party attended by powerful demons; to promote\
  \ the <em>Advanced Class Guide</em>, be sure to give them levels in something sensible\
  \ like bloodrager. This is a social encounter. Use the structure employed in <em>The\
  \ Blakros Matrimony</em> in which the PCs must positively influence multiple demons\
  \ to apologize sufficiently for ruining their party; however, skill checks alone\
  \ are insufficient. A PC must perform a profane act of villainous, self-effacing\
  \ depravity to be allowed to attempt a skill check. Be sure to include a sidebar\
  \ reminding the GM how the atonement spell works.</p> \n      <p>Once the PCs successfully\
  \ convince the demons to let them go, they are free to explore adjacent rooms in\
  \ a sandbox-style adventure that actually allows the players no freedom of choice.\
  \ To introduce the PCs to Charnelhome lightly, start them on easy (APL+4) encounters\
  \ before ramping up the difficulty. Consider classic encounters such as fiendish\
  \ kraken, hydras that are actually amalgams of all linnorms published to date, prismatic\
  \ spray elementals, greater pugwampis, and some kind of evil clown demon (include\
  \ the creature's stats in the appendix in case you want to use these in multiple\
  \ encounters). When mapping this area, depict at least one chamber that can only\
  \ be represented accurately by printing out the map and twisting it into a non-Euclidean\
  \ Mobius strip. Should the PCs have difficulties, Shax himself appears in a burst\
  \ of blood mist wearing a pristine white smoking jacket to heal the Pathfinders\
  \ sufficiently to continue the adventure.</p> \n      <p>Once the PCs have overcome\
  \ these routine challenges, begin presenting them with more difficult encounters.\
  \ Popular choices include swarms of vorpal chickens, elder god golems (don't use\
  \ that imitation elder god stuff; use the real thing), kaiju, and abyssal gut worms\
  \ that consume the PCs from the inside out (pro tip: this grants them a surprise\
  \ round). To save on word count, consider referencing random encounters in existing\
  \ Adventure Path volumes without actually reprinting relevant text.</p> \n     \
  \ <p>The PCs then come across a courtyard garden in which Shax has set out a pleasant\
  \ buffet, table settings, and chairs. He apologizes for the PCs' recent inconveniences\
  \ and invites the PCs to relax and let him know if anything has upset them lately.\
  \ If the PCs fail to list their grievances without using the letter E, Shax cackles,\
  \ eats 5d4+5 random boons (including ones earned by non-participating characters),\
  \ and teleports them back to the initial encounter, where they find an insulting\
  \ handout that informs them why they failed. When the PCs next encounter Shax, he\
  \ repeats his tactic but chooses five other different letters at random to listen\
  \ for. The third time, Shax is absent, but if any PC looks for him, the GM gets\
  \ to smash the player's mini with a hammer (included with the pdf download). The\
  \ scenario concludes with a thrilling ten-paragraph opus of read-aloud text in which\
  \ less competent Pathfinders save the PCs in an excruciating act of <i>deus ex machina</i>.</p>\
  \ \n      <h2>Metaplot</h2> \n      <p>Season 5, Year of the Demon, does not use\
  \ traditional faction missions, but many scenarios emphasize the season goals of\
  \ one or more factions. When such a faction's goal features in a scenario, it typically\
  \ takes up more time than a Season 0-4 faction mission would have, but many are\
  \ tasks that a Pathfinder of any faction would find interesting.</p> \n      <p>The\
  \ Decemvirate faction is interested in accomplishing awesome stuff, which is explained\
  \ in a faction head letter update on paizo.com accessible only by moderators. Include\
  \ several opportunities for faction PCs to fulfill goals that rely heavily on player\
  \ knowledge and yet-to-be-published sourcebooks in the Pathfinder Campaign Setting\
  \ line.</p> \n      <h2>Maps</h2> \n      <p>You have a map allotment of 5 pages\
  \ worth of new maps to create for this adventure. These can be 5 vertically aligned\
  \ full-page maps or 10 horizontally aligned half-page maps. In either case, north\
  \ should correspond with real-world geographic north when at all possible. Feel\
  \ free to use out-of-print maps from Paizo's GameMastery Flip Mat and Map Pack lines.\
  \ If you decide to generate your own maps, be sure that no single map can fit on\
  \ a Flip Mat (24x30 squares). When possible, have one square equal 27 feet.</p>\
  \ \n      <h2>Additional Reference Material</h2> \n      <p>Since this adventure\
  \ takes place in Charnelhome, please familiarize yourself with that topic before\
  \ outlining and writing the scenario.</p> \n      <blockquote> \n       <p><b><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Campaign Setting: Book of the Damned, Volume 2: Lords of Chaos</em></b>: This\
  \ book contains one sentence about Charnelhome.<br> <b>Beer:</b> When consumed in\
  \ vast quantities, this beverage may assist you in deciding what else is true about\
  \ Charnelhome.</p> \n      </blockquote> \n     </blockquote> \n     <div class=\"\

  \ \n     <p>To Thursty's extraordinary credit, he took this assignment email and\
  \ expanded it into a massive April Fool's Day email campaign sent to various Paizo\
  \ employees. Among these jokingly-crafted missives were a letter to the finance\
  \ department asking to meet in person in Florida for the cash transaction (which\
  \ Thursty would happily pay using Canadian currency), a letter to Mark telling him\
  \ to add a wealth of 3rd-party publications to the stat block spreadsheet (and build\
  \ a new one to handle 3rd-edition psionics), a letter to the tech team requesting\
  \ a new section of the website dedicated to the adventure be designed within the\
  \ next week (including an interactive and animated demon element programmed entirely\
  \ in Flash), and an email to several of our marketing and sales folks instructing\
  \ them to prioritize a massive world-wide release of the adventure over promoting\
  \ PaizoCon (including a request that Cosmo somehow finagle a Shax's House of Pain\
  \ TV series). Of course, each of these ended with a polite request to forward any\
  \ questions the recipients might have to Mark Moreland.</p> \n     <p>Perhaps my\
  \ favorite was a letter to our project manager, Jessica Price. With their permission,\
  \ I'll reprint a portion here.</p> \n     <blockquote> <i><p>The sheer amount of\
  \ energy required to upkeep the time travel necessary to match these timelines is\
  \ ridiculous. I have done some research, speaking with AP authors, and I have discovered\
  \ that they are only required to go 1 week back in time to complete their projects.\
  \ This is just another example of how AP authors are given <b><u>preferential treatment</u></b>\
  \ over PFS writers. I don't mean to rant, but this is getting out of hand.</p> <p>I\
  \ don't know how much money AP authors are expected to pay when they are tasked\
  \ with writing for Paizo, but I'm assuming it's somewhere in the thousands. Compare\
  \ this to the paltry tribute us PFS authors need to provide to our overseers...\
  \ Again, further discrimination.</p> <p>Anyways, I digress. I simply wanted you\
  \ to be aware of this potential problem with scheduling. As I am a handsome and\
  \ charming miracle worker, this will pose no problem for me, but other less handsome\
  \ authors may struggle under these conditions. My suggestion is to increase the\
  \ tribute required by PFS authors to at least $XX, that way you know they have a\
  \ well-paying job that affords them the extra time to work on freelance.</p></i>\
  \ \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>Her response?</p> \n     <blockquote> <i><p>Thanks\
  \ for the heads-up, Thursty. Unfortunately, we don't currently have the resources\
  \ to manage having you pay us fees equal to those of the AP writers, or to extend\
  \ your deadlines further into the past. I'm happy to put a meeting together to reevaluate\
  \ this after our Gen Con 2025 crunch period, when we should all have a bit more\
  \ breathing room to circle the wagons on our current processes.</p></i> \n     </blockquote>\
  \ \n     <p>Brilliant.</p> \n     <p>The madness gradually wound down by the end\
  \ of the day, but I fondly remember April 1st, 2014 as one of my favorite April\
  \ Fool's pranks. The holiday's almost here again, but I think I'll take this year\
  \ off. After all, I need to save my energy for another round of memory making at\
  \ this year's <a href=\"/paizocon\">PaizoCon</a>!</p> \n     <p>Oh, and Thursty?\
  \ I still haven't received your turnover. What gives?</p> \n     <p>John Compton<br>\
