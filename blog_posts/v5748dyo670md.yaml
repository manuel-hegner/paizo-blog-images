  \ of the Amber Die—Doomsday Dawn Playtest, Part 1</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Saturday,\
  \ July 25, 2018</p> \n    <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  \ style=\"display: none;\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderAdventurePath/20180519-Preview.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderAdventurePath/20180519-Preview_360.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">You've heard their tales of marathon\
  \ Adventure Path sessions, now the folks from the Order of the Amber Die are eagerly\
  \ leaping into the Pathfinder Playtest. Below is the first report from their table\
  \ as they play through the first portion of <i>Doomsday Dawn</i>! Beware spoilers\
  \ if you intend on playing through this adventure!</p> \n     <blockquote> \n  \
  \    <p>The Order has a storied past with edition changes, as we began playing first\
  \ edition AD&amp;D in our GM's basement in 1987. Over the years, we switched to\
  \ 2.0, then 3.0, next to 3.5, skipped 4th and went to 3.75—and yet now we stare\
  \ at another phase of the game's evolution. For eighteen years, we've essentially\
  \ played some iteration of 3.0—our longest stint in any edition. After so many years,\
  \ it is an honor to be able to present our data from the dawn of a new era!</p>\
  \ \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20180825-PlaytestOpener.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20180825-PlaytestOpener_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a> <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20180825-GroupShot.jpg\"><img\
  \ src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20180825-GroupShot_360.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \      </div> \n      <p>We've found that one of the best ways for a group to make\
  \ the shift to a new edition is simply as a group. The players held several get-togethers\
  \ and also used a live document to guide each other through some of this edition's\
  \ most radical changes. To physically represent the new feature of Hero Points,\
  \ one of our members cut tokens from aircraft aluminum in the likeness of the Amber\
  \ Die. Another member created dozens of condition cards—a set for everyone. To celebrate\
  \ the debut of Pathfinder's new goblin iconic, we reached out to <a href=\"http://www.aradani.com\"\
  >Aradani Studios</a> for the first set of goblin ears ever to appear at our table.\
  \ Lastly, Fumbus had to have a miniature to match the rest of the iconics, and the\
  \ artists at <a href=\"http://bluetablepainting.com/\">Blue Table Painting</a> made\
  \ sure that a goblin would show proudly among the veteran iconic miniatures around\
  \ him!</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <h2>The Party</h2> \n     <blockquote> \n\
  \      <p>Our roster throughout the playtest will adjust slightly for each part,\
  \ consisting of OAD veterans from previous Paizo blog projects such as <a href=\"\
  /community/blog/v5748dyo5lhx3?Giantslayer-Marathon-Part-6\"><i>The Giantslayer Endeavor</i></a>,\
  \ <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo5lk5x?Order-of-the-Amber-DieThe-Strange-Aeons#1\"\
  ><i>The Strange Aeons Experiment</i></a>, and <a href=\"/search?what=all&amp;q=azlant+odyssey+part+4\"\
  ><i>The Azlant Odyssey</i></a>. Also listed is the year they became a member of\
  \ the Order (when a player has reached 100 hours at our table). While Resonance\
  \ was tough on us without a cleric, this party set out to prove that even a non-traditional\
  \ lineup without major access to healing could thrive in the new edition.</p> \n\

  \ \n     <h2>Highlights From The Lost Star</h2> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p>Not\
  \ long after entering the Ashen Ossuary in search of a family heirloom, we got into\
  \ a sprawling melee with goblins in the dark. What we used to call the tedious \"\
  five-foot shuffle,\" now became the highly mobile \"goblin scuttle,\" and they ran\
  \ circles around us. Our GM used the new third action to have goblins break away\
  \ and run toward our back ranks, dog slicers in hand. Without attacks of opportunity,\
  \ no one was entirely safe.</p> \n      <p>When it came to Hero Points, we saw plenty\
  \ of them. In addition to the standard one point per session and one for contributing\
  \ (OAD members are expected to carry plenty of out-of-game tasks), we threw ourselves\
  \ at the adventure trying to do something daring or heroic enough to warrant an\
  \ additional point. In the end, we were conservative with the points we earned—\
  maybe too much—but their ability to save us from death was worth keeping around.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>The final battle was nothing short of the action we've come to expect\
  \ from Pathfinder. Sajan led the way into the chamber occupied by Drakus the Taker,\
  \ a hobgoblin thought to be a vampire. The monk let off a shot with an expert crossbow\
  \ he'd picked up, enhanced with magic weapon: natural 20. Fumbus followed in, urging\
  \ the party on by throwing an alchemist's fire bomb: another natural 20. Drakus\
  \ reverted to his true form, then lashed out with a natural 20 of his own, dropping\
  \ the goblin renegade. A round later, the monk too lay at the feet of the ugothol.\
  \ With just Seoni and Lem left, the sorcerer used three Hero Points to move into\
  \ line of sight, followed by a full casting of <i>magic missile</i> for the win!</p>\
  \ \n     </blockquote> \n     <h2>Current Situation</h2> \n     <blockquote> \n\
  \      <p>Near the end of our crawl through the ossuary, Lem suffered a critical\
  \ hit from a poisoned lock that left the halfling struggling for life; before the\
  \ poison could advance further, we hurried to the safety of Magnimar's streets.\
  \ We also recovered the lost Star of Desna, and returned it to Keleri Deverin with\
  \ plenty of time to reach the Swallowtail Festival—she couldn't be late for the\
  \ launch of one of Paizo's most legendary Adventure Paths!</p> \n      <p>Follow\
