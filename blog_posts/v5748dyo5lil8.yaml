  \ Mystery—Oracle Class Deck Preview</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, March 15,\
  \ 2016</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\"\
  >In the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, the oracle is a divine spellcaster driven by\
  \ devotion to an ideal rather than to a particular deity. The specific source of\
  \ an oracle's abilities is a mystery, and each oracle is burdened with a curse of\
  \ some kind, for power has a price. When we designed the first version of Alahazra\
  \ the Oracle for the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game, we found ourselves drawn to\
  \ the idea of prophecy and foresight. That idea carried through into the new character\
  \ designs for the <a href=\"/products/btpy9ezo\"><em>Oracle Class Deck</em></a>.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>In the <a href=\"/products/btpy92zj\"><em>Skull &amp; Shackles Base Set</em></a>,\
  \ the blind Oracle Alahazra wielded the power of storms against her enemies, while\
  \ using her divine abilities to open a brief window into the party's future. In\
  \ her new incarnation, the Bride of the Sun calls down the daystar's light on anyone\
  \ who gets in her way, and that dazzling illumination makes many things clear to\
  \ even those who lack eyesight. (She also has a sweet <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lid6\"\
  >hat</a>.)</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6010-AlahazraToken.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>No, we don't know how she gets dressed like that without sight\
  \ either.</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>That last role power works in combination with\
  \ the second power, so Alahazra can provide a long term strategic view of what's\
  \ to come by peeking at the bottom two cards of a deck. Cartmanbeck gave you a preview\
  \ of her other role, Wandering Prophet, <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lijp\">two\
  \ weeks ago</a>.</p> \n    <p>For the two new characters in the <a href=\"/products/btpy9ezo\"\
  ><em>Oracle Class Deck</em></a>, we decided to get freaky with our divination methods.\
  \ Ramexes, as mentioned in that \"Class Decks Update\" blog, is a haruspex. That\
  \ means he guts things and sees what's to come in their entrails. Since we're fully\
  \ into fantasy stereotypes here at the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game, we knew Ramexes\
  \ had to be a pitborn.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6812-RamexesToken.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6812-RamexesToken_120.jpeg\"></a> <a\
  \ href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6812-RamexesFront.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6812-RamexesFront_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6812-Haruspex.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6812-Haruspex_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> <i>He's not bad, he's just drawn that— ...well, actually, he's\
  \ pretty bad.</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>Ramexes has a straightforward \"kill 'em,\
  \ cut 'em open, see what's coming\" mechanic in his first character power. My favorite\
  \ power of all time is his third character power, in which he cuts open his allies\
  \ to gain prescience and bonus explorations. I cackle every time I play him, and\
  \ he's one of my playtest characters for Season of the Runelords, so I play him\
  \ a lot. The other folks in the office have gotten used to the frequent cackles\
  \ that emanate from my cubicle. Or at least they've stopped asking about it.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The final character in our clairvoyant trio is Grazzle, a lizardfolk\
  \ life oracle who practices ossomancy, or bone divination. He's slightly more fastidious/carnivorous\
  \ than Ramexes, and prefers to use the whole kill rather than just the entrails.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6812-GrazzleToken.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6812-GrazzleToken_120.jpeg\"\
  ></a> <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6812-GrazzleFront.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6812-GrazzleFront_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6812-BoneDiviner.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6812-BoneDiviner_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Eye of newt and toe of frog, wool of bat and tongue of dog...\
  \ wait, </i>wool of bat<i>?</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>As you can see, Grazzle's focus\
  \ isn't on scrying, but rather on healing his party through a little self-sacrifice.\
  \ He can automatically recharge his spells, so he fights like a sorcerer, and the\
  \ Bone Diviner can still do a little divination where his friends are with a mechanic\
  \ similar to S&amp;S Alahazra. The Bone Diviner also has a power that works with\
  \ the variety of new diviner items that we've put in the <a href=\"/products/btpy9ezo\"\
  ><em>Oracle Class Deck</em></a>—but you'll have to wait and see those another time!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>I showed off this deck to a playtester of mine, and he shuffled through\
  \ the deck and gave me a look full of shock and misery. \"Where's Augury?\" he asked\
  \ plaintively.</p> \n    <p>That's right, kids, the <a href=\"/products/btpy9ezo\"\
  ><em>Oracle Class Deck</em></a> doesn't contain the Augury spell. Doesn't have it,\
  \ doesn't need it. Between the new items and powers we've jammed in there, these\
  \ oracles will be examining decks like it's their jobs; they'll want to save their\
  \ spell slots for other things. We encourage you to pick it up and try it out, and\
  \ see what you think.</p> \n    <p>Until next time, Pathfinders.</p> \n    <p>Tanis\
