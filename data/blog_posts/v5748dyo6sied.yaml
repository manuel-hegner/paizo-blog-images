  \ <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02eju?Pathfinder-Rage-of-Elements\"><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Rage of Elements</em></a> has been out for a while now, and we hope you’ve been\
  \ having a great time with your kineticists, elementals, travels to the elemental\
  \ planes, and all sorts of new spells, items, and monsters. We wanted to take this\
  \ chance to recognize the great authors who came together to make this project special.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>This book was initially concepted by Mark Seifter (who you’ll hear\
  \ from shortly) before he headed over to his current gig. I took over as the design\
  \ lead to shepherd the book along. Most of my work was outlining, coordination,\
  \ and a massive amount of changes to switch the book to the Remastered rules late\
  \ in the process.</p> \n      <p>Before we get into everyone’s bios, I must talk\
  \ about the contributions of Jessica Redekop and Sen H.H.S., who share cover credit\
  \ with me. Getting that level of credit requires a massive amount of work, and they\
  \ were both wonderful to work with and superb writers. Jess’s enthusiasm for the\
  \ planes and building out fun characters made the book such a fun read, and Sen\
  \ H.S.S.’s ideas for putting the elemental cycle into the game and Pathfinder setting\
  \ and creating the Plane of Wood were invaluable and incredibly creative. I’d also\
  \ like to shout out Paizo’s own Andrew White, who brought the Plane of Metal to\
  \ life, and James Case, who plunged into the Plane of Water with aplomb. And Kent\
  \ Hamilton’s beautiful concept art for elemental metal and wood helped guide designs\
  \ throughout the process, especially of monsters and locations.</p> \n      <p>In\
  \ addition to the authors with full bios below, this book features excellent writing\
  \ by Jason Bulmahn, James Case, Jessica Catalan, Andrew D. Geels, Luis Loza, Michael\
  \ Sayre, Shay Snow, Levi Steadman, Mari Tokuda, and Linda Zayas-Palmer!</p> \n \

  \ \n      <h3>Logan Bonner (he/him)</h3> \n      <p>(That’s me.) I’ve been designing\
  \ tabletop RPGs since 2006, and am the Pathfinder Lead Designer, doing overwatch\
  \ on the game rules as a whole. Lately I’ve been blooding, sweating, and tearing\
  \ the Pathfinder Remaster books. After being one of the four designers of Second\
  \ Edition, I’ve led <em>Pathfinder Secrets of Magic</em> to help set the template\
  \ for how we could stretch our legs with rulebooks in Second Edition, and later\
  \ led <em>Pathfinder Book of the Dead</em>, the remastered books, and at least one\
  \ upcoming, unannounced tome. My biggest writing contribution to <em>Rage of Elements</em>\
  \ was the kineticist class (with some expert help from the rest of the design team,\
  \ so you can blame/thank Michael Sayre for the Ambush Bladderwort). You can find\
  \ me on Twitter as @loganbonner and on Bluesky as @loganbonner.bsky.social.</p>\
  \ \n      <br> \n      <h3>Patrick Hurley</h3> \n      <p>Along with previous Paizo\
  \ publishing credits, Patrick Hurley has had short fiction appear in dozens of magazines\
  \ and book anthologies, including Factor Four, Galaxy's Edge, Abyss &amp; Apex,\
  \ and New Myths. As well as being managing editor at Paizo, Patrick is a graduate\
  \ of the 2017 Taos Toolbox Writer's Workshop and a member of SFWA. To read more\

  \ \n      <p>Hi folks, I'm Jason Keeley and I'm excited to have contributed even\
  \ a small part to <em>Rage of Elements</em>. I've recently returned to Paizo as\
  \ a Senior Developer for the Rules &amp; Lore team, which means that all I've written\
  \ for Pathfinder Second Edition has been training for this time! When I'm not doing\
  \ things for Paizo, I spend my time recording a couple of podcasts in the Know Direction\
  \ network, collaborating with Joe Pasini on puzzles, and generally working on other\
  \ TTRPG projects—like my cereal mascot game <em>This Compleat Breakfast</em>, available\
  \ for free at <a href=\"https://herzwesten.itch.io/this-compleat-breakfast\">https://herzwesten.itch.io/this-compleat-breakfast</a>!\
  \ You can usually find me under the name \"herzwesten\" on most social media platforms.</p>\
  \ \n      <br> \n      <h3>Jon Morgantini</h3> \n      <p>Hello there! I'm Jon,\
  \ the Community and Social Media Manager here at Paizo. My work was focused on creatures\
  \ of air and earth for <em>Pathfinder Rage of Elements</em>. It was my first freelance\
  \ writing opportunity and it was so much fun! It's been very heartening to see the\
  \ reaction to the book from everyone. I definitely have other projects coming down\
  \ the line so you will just have to keep an eye out for my name in other places!\
  \ When I'm not writing, I'm usually lost in Hyrule or perhaps some far corner of\
  \ the galaxy, if not rereading the Wheel of Time series or whatever the dark fantasy\
  \ du jour is. You can find me @loremasterjon over on Bluesky, where I soon hope\
  \ to pontificate about writing my own Pathfinder Second Edition–compatible setting.\
  \ In the meantime, play ALL the games!</p> \n      <br> \n      <h3>AJ Neuro (he/him\
  \ and they/them)</h3> \n      <p>Pura Vida! I'm AJ, a Costa Rican game designer.\
  \ Writing the elemental backgrounds for <em>Rage of Elements</em> was my first official\
  \ contribution to Pathfinder, but I've also written for the recently announced <a\
  \ href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sie7?Welcome-to-the-War-of-Immortals-Playtest\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder War of Immortals</em></a>! A few of you might have also seen some\
  \ of my <a href=\"https://www.ajneuro.com/pf2freecontent\">free resources for the\
  \ Pathfinder community</a>. I'm also a professional GM, and I run both official\
  \ Pathfinder Second Edition adventures on Golarion, and adventures of my own making\
  \ in my setting of <a href=\"http://www.ajneuro.com/ex-nihilo\">Ex Nihilo</a>! If\
  \ you'd like to join one of my groups, or would like me to GM for your group, don't\
  \ be shy and shoot me a message. By the way, we're actually a DID system, but we\
  \ generally prefer to present as an individual; it's just easier for us (<em>waves\
  \ at all the other plurals reading this</em>) :)</p> \n      <br> \n      <br> \n\

  \ I'm Jess, and I like elementals, the planes, and the elemental planes. I got to\
  \ write a lot of <em>Rage of Elements</em> (enough to get my name on the cover!)\
  \ but my favorite section is the introduction to the air chapter, with the mercurial\
  \ air narrator, Shanaria.</p> \n      <p>I love this book and I'm so grateful for\
  \ the opportunity to write such a large portion of it. A book focused on the elemental\
  \ planes, giving them the compelling and interesting presentation they've always\
  \ deserved, is like my ultimate dream project. It's weird to feel so early in my\
  \ career but to have already achieved something so monumental and important to me.\
  \ I hope <em>Rage of Elements</em> helps to open the elemental planes in your games\
  \ as fun, cool places your characters want to explore!</p> \n      <p>When I'm not\
  \ writing, you can find me on the Know Direction podcast network as a cohost of\
  \ Legend Lore and cast member on Tavern Rats, a new actual play. On the social medias,\
  \ I'm @tectonomancer.bsky.social.</p> \n      <h3>Mark Seifter</h3> \n      <p>Hi\
  \ everyone, Mark Seifter here! For those who don't know me, I've been the design\
  \ lead on over 100 tabletop RPG game titles and worked on even more for Paizo and\
  \ various other companies in the tabletop RPG industry, and I was one of the four\
  \ leads on the creation of Pathfinder Second Edition.</p> \n      <p>I love writing\
  \ about elemental options, and in <em>Rage of Elements</em>, I especially enjoyed\
  \ working on the elemental eidolon, which I hope gives you a fun and different playstyle\
  \ than the existing options. I also authored the Lysianassa deity entry, the aether\
  \ and void sidebar in the introduction (which turned out even more interesting with\
  \ the advent of void damage), and more! I hope you enjoyed them.</p> \n      <p>You\
  \ can check out my Twitch stream, Arcane Mark, with Linda Zayas-Palmer at <a href=\"\

  \ long time no see! Working as the cultural consultant and cover author of <em>Rage\
  \ of Elements</em> was a wild ride, and I'm delighted that everyone is enjoying\
  \ the book. I hope to hear your stories about your adventures in the returning Planes\
  \ of Metal and Wood sometime in the near future. As a cover author, I worked on\
  \ a little bit on everything, from some metal, wood, earth, fire, and water spells\
  \ and items, to the four elemental lords Ayrzul, Kelizandri, Laudinmio, and Shumunue.\
  \ I also did the introductions for the Plane of Wood and the Churn of Elements,\
  \ plus creatures such as the nightwood guardian, ore louse, marajau, and some fire\
  \ elementals. (Lava otters are the best!) I hope all of those help make your upcoming\
  \ planar adventures all the more exciting! As for what's coming up, please mark\
  \ your calendars for the Season of Ghosts Adventure Path, which begins with <em>Pathfinder\
  \ Adventure Path #196: The Summer That Never Was</em> at the end of this year! You\

  \ \n      <p>Marhaba everyone! I’m Shahreena and I've been freelancing for Paizo\
  \ for about five years. <em>Rage of Elements</em> was a particularly exciting project\
  \ to work on, as I was not only involved as a writer, but also as a cultural consultant.\
  \ I was inspired by the creative muse in pre-Islamic poetic traditions to create\
  \ gennayn; by stories of nightmarish spirits to contribute to jaathoom; by Middle\
  \ Eastern hospitality to create faydhaan shuyookhs; and by the storyteller Shahrazaad,\
  \ from <em>Alf Layla wa Layla</em>, or <em>1001 Nights</em>, to develop Shazathared.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Beyond writing, I helped reconceptualize the genies. You may have noticed\
  \ the cleanup of similar-sounding genie names, new genie lore and abilities more\
  \ engaged with folklore, and old genie names changed to theme-appropriate names.\
  \ (As someone raised in a Muslim household, I was especially happy to contribute\
  \ to the removal of “shaitan” for earth genie!) I also engaged in Arabic grammatical\
  \ discussions on nonbinary terms of address in search of ways to address genie nobles—\
  fun times! I hope you enjoy these genies as much as I enjoyed working on them.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>If you're looking for a Middle East specialist for freelance work,\
  \ feel free to contact me on Discord at Shahreena1.</p> \n      <br> \n      <h3>Solomon\
  \ St. John (they/them)</h3> \n      <p>Greetings internet. I go by Sol day-to-day\
  \ and, in addition to being one of the freelancers who contributed to <em>Rage of\
  \ Elements</em>, I was also the editing lead, a role I also fill for both Pathfinder\
  \ and Starfinder Society over in Organized Play.</p> \n      <p>Versatile heritages\
  \ are one of my favorite features in all of Pathfinder Second Edition, so I leapt\
  \ at the chance to write the talos heritage; I also wrote the accompanying creature\
  \ stat block, the section on zuhra genies, and all of the wood elementals from wood\
  \ wisps to the twins of rowan. That last bunch was especially fun, since I could\
  \ draw inspiration from all sorts of places—from wooden dolls and obscure folklore\
  \ like the vegetable lamb, to clonal organisms like the IRL “trembling giant” and\
  \ the existential concept of growth itself. It’s my largest Paizo writing contribution\
  \ to date and I’m delighted you all finally get to enjoy the fruits of our hard\
  \ work.</p> \n      <p>My next Paizo project is just around the corner, so keep\
  \ an eye out for <em>Starfinder Society Scenario #6-07: Race for the Dustwarren\
  \ Cup</em>. Find me online @stjohnsol.bsky.social for a quiet feed of reblogs and\

  \ <em>retrieval prism</em> talisman, or a large part of the Niswan entry for Jalmeray\
  \ in&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Impossible Lands</em>. It was a blast working\
  \ on&nbsp;<em>Rage of Elements</em>&nbsp;with a lot of awesome people. This time,\
  \ I got to really light the spark of imagination to bring you the entry for Ymeri,\
  \ Queen of the Inferno, some of the new fire spells (like one where you can summon\
