  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Scales rustled across the hardwood deck\
  \ of the corsair <i>Stargazer</i> as she plied the moonlit waters of the Obari Ocean.\
  \ The crew of the ship had heard the sound many times before, especially on nights\
  \ when the sky hung overhead like a black silk tapestry strewn with diamonds. This\
  \ was <i>her</i> time, and they knew better than to bother her when her attention\
  \ was on the heavens.</p> \n    <p>Celeste squinted through her sextant at the bright\
  \ planet Triaxus, also known as the Wanderer, which had just entered the constellation\
  \ of the Sea Wraith. That boded well, and she manipulated the stylus to scratch\
  \ down the planet's angle to the horizon. Glancing at the neat array of hour- and\
  \ minute-glasses—calibrated that very evening at the precise moment of sunset—she\
  \ noted the exact time. She took another sighting, this one of the rising moon,\
  \ and the stylus scratched down another pair of numbers. Lowering the sextant, Celeste\
  \ performed the calculations to determine the ship's latitude and longitude. With\
  \ a flick of magic so familiar that she barely had to think of the spell, she floated\
  \ her plotting tools out of their leather case, rolled out the chart of the Jalmeray\
  \ coast, and meticulously plotted their position.</p> \n    <p>\"Well?\" a gravelly\
  \ voice asked as the stylus scratched an \"X\" on the chart and wrote down the time.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Celeste's tail gave an involuntary flick of annoyance at the interruption,\
  \ but she stifled her natural response to rise on her coils and hiss. Most of the\
  \ crew members were more cautious about interrupting the lunar naga during her reading\
  \ of the stars, but <i>Stargazer</i>'s half-orc bosun was an incautious fellow.\
  \ Besides, he was just doing his job. They were sailing in dangerous waters, and\
  \ he needed to know their position.</p> \n    <p>\"You may turn to zero-eight-zero\
  \ degrees, Grogul, or as close to that heading as the wind will allow.\" Celeste\
  \ put away her instruments and folded the case closed against the salt air. \"We're\
  \ beyond Jalmeray's southern reefs, and can begin our approach of Kaina Katakka's\
  \ south coast.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Good!\" Grogul turned away without a word of thanks,\
  \ as usual, and started barking orders to the crew.</p> \n    <p><i>Stargazer</i>\
  \ turned to windward, her sails trimmed smartly, and began the slow beat to the\
  \ northeast. When they settled on their new heading, Celeste noted the set of the\
  \ stars against the foremast and yards; if they started to drift off course, she\
  \ would know.</p> \n    <p>Though she had two hours until she needed to take another\
  \ celestial fix on their position, Celeste retrieved her sextant once again and\
  \ recorded the elevations of several more planets. She then traded the sextant for\
  \ a finely wrought telescope and observed the heavenly bodies more closely. She\
  \ noted every detail—every angle, rotation, and position of every moon—and carefully\
  \ scratched them into her logbook. These observations had nothing to do with celestial\
  \ navigation, but with the science of astrology: the intricate song of the heavens\
  \ and its interaction with the events and beings of this world.</p> \n    <p>Tonight,\
  \ she was concerned with the stars' attitude regarding one particular being: Torius\
  \ Vin, captain of the <i>Stargazer</i>.</p> \n    <p>With the harmonies of the planets\
  \ and constellations singing in her mind, and all the numerical data she needed\
  \ to interpret them, she consulted her astrological texts. This was the hard part;\
  \ the stars never lied, but interpretation of their message was often fraught with\
  \ uncertainty. She knew Torius's astrological signature—the position of every celestial\
  \ body of significance at the moment of his birth—and she had just observed the\
  \ current state of the cosmos. How these two interacted was the puzzle she had to\
  \ solve.</p> \n    <p>Nothing of significance had changed since her previous reading:\
  \ The planet Liavara, the Dreamer, still traversed the constellation of the Lantern\
  \ Bearer, Torius's birth sign. The Wanderer would soon cross the constellation of\
  \ the Key, the symbol of Abadar, the god of wealth. The planet Castrovel was ascending\
  \ into the Lantern Bearer, denoting desire, lust, love, or life. The reading seemed\
  \ straightforward; Torius's dreams, his desire for wealth, would be realized.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Celeste crooked a smile and bent to the chart. If the prophecy still\
  \ held, then so did their course. Her readings of the other planets—Eox, the Dead,\
  \ traversing the Wagon, beneath the constellation of the Throne—had pointed to the\
  \ long-dead indigenous peoples of the island nation of Jalmeray. Those who had not\
  \ perished or been enslaved when the great Vudrani maharajah Khiben-Sald introduced\
  \ his foreign gods and elemental creatures to the island had fled to Kaina Katakka.\
  \ There they had lived for a time, until the governance of Jalmeray fell into the\
  \ hands of the Arclords. Wanting no potentially rebellious natives so near, the\
  \ Arclords had exterminated the entire population, leaving Kaina Katakka a devastated\
  \ ruin.</p> \n    <p>That was their destination.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\"\

  0\"></a>\n     <br> Torius knows that a captain is only as good as his crew.\n \
  \   </div> \n    <p>Destiny resides in the stars, she thought, closing her texts\
  \ and stowing them. She gazed up into the endless tapestry of the cosmos and sighed\
  \ with pleasure. Out here, far from land, the veil of the heavens shone so clearly\
  \ that it seemed close enough to touch. Here under the stars—aboard a pirate ship,\
  \ of all places—she had found her own dreams' desire: a home. These people trusted\
  \ her, relied upon her expertise and appreciated her talent in reading the secrets\
  \ of the firmament. She belonged. She was loved.</p> \n    <p>Celeste swayed with\
  \ the easy motion of the ship, reveling in a peaceful night under the stars, her\
  \ favorite place in the world. Her mind drifted, and she contemplated her other\
  \ favorite place. A smile touched her pale lips, and her forked tongue flicked out\
  \ to scent the night air. There it was, that heady fragrance of leather, spice,\
  \ and human, as signature as his stellar harmonic.</p> \n    <p><i>Torius Vin</i>\
  \ ...</p> \n    <p>The ship's bell chimed, interrupting her thoughts. Eight notes\
  \ in two-stroke pairs, which meant the watch change. As if her thoughts had conjured\
  \ him from the air, she heard his approach, his soft leather boots brushing the\
  \ deck with a faint whisk not unlike that of her own scales. She did not turn, but\
  \ waited, knowing how he would greet her, longing for that familiar touch.</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"Celeste,\" he said, his voice singing the song of the heavens in her mind\
  \ as his hand ran through her alabaster hair.</p> \n    <p>\"My captain.\" She turned\
  \ and smiled at him, her coils shuddering in an involuntary shiver of delight.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Are we on course?\" He glanced at the chart on the deck.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>She scanned the stars and nodded. \"There's a slight northerly set to the current,\
  \ but we're not far off the plot line. I'll take another fix to confirm my calculations,\
  \ but we should reach Kaina Katakka's coast before dawn. We will reach the cove\
  \ by late morning.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Good.\" His fingers slipped from her hair and\
  \ he left her to make his rounds of <i>Stargazer</i>'s quarterdeck, checking the\
  \ hundreds of details that kept the ship running smoothly. She neither knew nor\
  \ cared much about these details. Her milieu was above, while his was here—his ship,\
  \ his crew, canvas and wood, steel and rope, lives dependent on his every decision.\
  \ She might chart their destiny, but he sailed it. He returned to her and asked\
  \ quietly, \"So, you're sure about this?\"</p> \n    <p>She smiled at him again.\
  \ In front of his crew, he was always decisive and confident; only with her did\
  \ he let down his guard and expose his uncertainties. \"The stars never lie, my\
  \ captain.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I know, but the truth they tell is often only clear\
  \ in hindsight.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Torius,\" she said, brushing against his shoulder,\
  \ \"the prophecy is clear; your dreams and desires for wealth will be realized here.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Good, because I've been dreaming of gold a lot lately. A pirate's\
  \ got to eat, after all. After our last little problem, money's been hard to come\
  \ by.\" He turned away and began to pace the quarterdeck, his hands clenched firmly\
  \ behind his back. She watched, admiring the preternatural grace that made his movements\
  \ so fluid, almost serpentine, even on the rolling deck of a ship.</p> \n    <p>The\
  \ problem he mentioned had cost them virtually their entire stake, including the\
  \ profits of their last successful job. She slithered to his side and whispered,\
  \ \"Don't worry.\"</p> \n    <p>He laughed quietly, running his hand slowly through\
  \ her hair again. \"Telling the captain of a ship not to worry is like telling the\
  \ desert not to be dry or the ocean not to be wet, Celeste. Until we get a solid\
  \ stake again, enough to pay the crew and provision the ship properly, I'm <i>going</i>\
  \ to worry.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Very well, my captain,\" she said, leaning in to nuzzle\
  \ his neck. That was another reason she loved him: he might be a pirate, but he\
  \ truly cared about his people. He cared about <i>her</i>. She turned to her navigational\
  \ instruments once again and floated the sextant up to her eye. \"You worry, and\
  \ I will consult the stars.\"</p> \n    <p align=\"center\">∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n    <p>Torius\
  \ squinted into the glare as the island's barren coast coalesced from the thinning\
  \ morning mists. As always, Celeste's navigation was flawless. She had already retired\
  \ to his cabin for the day, so he would have to compliment her later. He just hoped\
  \ her astrological prophecy was as accurate.</p> \n    <p>\"This cove got a name,\
  \ Captain?\" Grogul asked, as the brigantine eased slowly nearer under reefed topsails\
  \ alone.</p> \n    <p>Torius glanced up at the half-orc; he was taller by a wide\
  \ hand and probably outweighed the captain by half, but Torius knew that he was\
  \ more than the brute he appeared to be. Grogul was a fine bosun, a skilled sailor,\
  \ and a good tactician, even if he did disdain the more esoteric points of seamanship.\
  \ More than anything, Grogul was solid, dependable, and unfailingly loyal. The captain\
  \ wouldn't trade him for a half-dozen fancy, rapier-wielding swashbucklers.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Not on the chart.\" Torius scanned the rocky beach with his spyglass.\
  \ There were no visible signs that the place had ever been inhabited. \"Used to\
  \ be a village or town or something here. Seems way back when Nex gave Jalmeray\
  \ to the Vudrani, the indigenous population hightailed it and came here. Then the\
  \ Arclords blasted the entire island to cinders.\" He wasn't about to tell Grogul\
  \ the rumors that the island was haunted.</p> \n    <p>\"And they brought their\
  \ treasures with 'em?\" Grogul squinted skeptically at Torius as he ran a thumbnail\
  \ down the gleaming edge of his axe. \"Just waitin' in a big pile for us to pick\
  \ up?\"</p> \n    <p>\"That's what we're here to find out. More likely to find a\
  \ smuggler's stash or some such.\"</p> \n    <p>\"As long as it spends, I'm not\
  \ picky, sir.\" Grogul knew as well as anyone the dire straits they were in when\
  \ it came to ready cash.</p> \n    <p>Torius pointed to the northeast corner of\
  \ the sheltered cove. \"Drop a stern kedge and bring her in close there. The tide's\
  \ on the rise, so drop the bow anchor when there's a fathom under her keel, and\
  \ keep her hove short. Oh, and have Snick get her babies ready, just in case we\
  \ have to dissuade any pursuit.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Aye, Captain!\" Grogul grinned.\
  \ \"You want me to tell her she's in command while we're ashore, since we're short\
  \ a first mate?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Sure. It'll make her day.\" Torius smiled, knowing\
  \ his gnome engineer would revel in her authority, short-lived though it might be,\
  \ driving the crew crazy with all manner of inane orders. Snick was an invaluable\
  \ member of the crew; she kept the ship functioning and her babies—the twelve beautifully\
  \ crafted ballistae nestled below the deck—working perfectly. But she wasn't much\
  \ of a sailor. \"Launch the boats when we're anchored. I'll be in my cabin.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Aye, sir.\"</p> \n    <p>Despite the daylight outside, Torius's cabin\
  \ was as dark as midnight, with black curtains drawn tight over the transom windows\
  \ and a shade pulled over the skylight. Celeste lay coiled on her collection of\
  \ thick pillows and rugs, only the waves of her white hair visible in the gloom.\
  \ He moved silently to his bunk and lit a lamp, keeping the flame low. His sword,\
  \ a beautiful silver-hilted cutlass, hung from a peg. He lifted it down and clipped\
  \ it to his belt, then pulled a brace of knives from a drawer. He clipped the long\
  \ fighting dagger with a sword-catching crosspiece to the other side of his belt,\
  \ and slid the heavy throwing knife into his boot. He retrieved a couple of his\
  \ standard surprises, trinkets and potions that could distract an enemy or save\
  \ a life if they ran into trouble, and tucked them away. One last adjustment of\
  \ his belt and a glance in the mirror—just to make sure that his mustache and goatee\
  \ were trimmed and combed properly and his hat had just the right rakish tilt—and\
  \ he was ready.</p> \n    <p>\"Be careful, my captain,\" Celeste said as he reached\
  \ for the door's brass handle.</p> \n    <p>\"Don't worry, my love.\" He gave her\
  \ an easy smile. \"This is the fun part.\"</p> \n    <p>Her tail twitched, but she\
  \ settled back down without another word. He left her there in the dark and joined\
  \ Grogul on deck. The longboats were bobbing beside the ship, the shore party armed\
  \ and ready. He regarded them professionally and grinned his approval—all proven\
  \ pirates, men and women he'd trust with his life, and who trusted him with theirs.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Don't worry about the ship while you're gone, Captain!\" a sprightly\
  \ voice called from the quarterdeck. He looked up to see Snick standing with her\
  \ slim legs splayed wide, her tiny hands on her narrow hips. She wore a brilliant\
  \ red tricorne hat that clashed horribly with her sea-green hair, and a short cutlass\
  \ at her belt. She snapped him an exaggerated salute. \"I'll keep an eye on things\
  \ for you!\"</p> \n    <p>\"Just keep your babies manned, Snick,\" he ordered, \"\
  and if anything that's not us tries to come aboard <i>my</i> ship, kill it.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Consider said beastie killed, Captain!\"</p> \n    <p>\"Good!\" He\
  \ turned to Grogul. \"Let's go.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Man the boats, you scrags!\" The\
  \ crew leapt to comply, swarming down the boarding nets into the boats.</p> \n \
  \   <p>They rowed ashore in silence, stowing their oars when the boats' keels grated\
  \ onto the rocky beach. Several sailors splashed into the surf to pull the boats\
  \ higher. Torius, exerting his captain's prerogative, waited until he could vault\
  \ ashore off the prow without getting his boots wet. The last thing he wanted was\
  \ to squish when he walked if they were going to do much exploring. Grogul assigned\
  \ four pirates with heavy crossbows to watch the boats, and joined his captain as\
  \ the dozen others worked their way to higher ground.</p> \n    <p>\"You sure about\
  \ this, Captain?\" He kept his voice low, his squinted eyes scanning the rocky,\
  \ vine-strewn cliffs. \"Don't look like much.\"</p> \n    <p>\"As sure as I've ever\
  \ been about one of Celeste's prophecies.\" Torius gave the half-orc a grin.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"And how sure is that?\" Grogul's dubious gaze turned to him; he was\
  \ never easily put off by Torius's assurances.</p> \n    <p>\"We'll find something\
  \ here, Grogul.\" He clapped the half-orc's meaty shoulder. \"As for my dreams'\
  \ desire for wealth ...\" He looked around skeptically at the devastated landscape.\
  \ \"I don't think the Arclords left enough to satisfy all of my—\"</p> \n    <p>A\
  \ strange, musical trill split the sultry air, drawing everyone's attention. Swords\
  \ rasped free of scabbards, and Torius found his hand on the hilt of his cutlass.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Whassat?\" asked one of the pirates, pointing to the foliage-covered\
  \ cliff face. \"It's comin' from up there!\"</p> \n    <p>\"This way!\" another\
  \ said, pointing to an overgrown path.</p> \n    <p>A number of the pirates started\
  \ forward, eager to find the source of the call, but Torius called them back with\
  \ a harsh, \"Hold fast there! Nobody goes blundering off!\"</p> \n    <p>Three of\
  \ them stopped in their tracks at the command, but several others just kept climbing\
  \ up the brush-strewn hillside, not even looking back at their captain.</p> \n \
  \   <p>That's not good, Torius thought. They're trained better than that.</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"Grogul! Come on!\" He drew his cutlass and hurried after them. \"The rest\
  \ of you, form up and follow. Quickly now!\"</p> \n    <p>Luckily, Torius and Grogul\
  \ were less hindered by the overgrowth than the pirates breaking trail. The captain's\
  \ group scrambled up, dislodging dry vines, loose rocks, and a cascade of leaves,\
  \ reaching the top just as the errant pirates hacked away a thick veil of foliage\
  \ covering a gaping cave mouth. Grogul's huge hand closed on a shoulder and he jerked\
  \ one woman back before she could venture inside. Torius and the others did likewise,\
  \ pulling their friends away. All the while, the strange trilling call continued\
  \ from within. One man twisted out of his mate's grasp and dashed into the darkness.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Epok! No!\" Torius shouted, too late.</p> \n    <p>The trilling call\
  \ fell silent, and a sharp crack and a loud thump echoed from within. The pirates\
  \ who had struggled to enter the cave stopped and looked at one another, their eyes\
  \ wide with bewilderment. Torius shivered with an unknown fear. Something was wrong;\
  \ none of his crew were so green that they would go charging into a dark cave like\
  \ that.</p> \n    <p>\"Don't like this, Captain.\" Grogul moved to the side of the\
  \ cave entrance. Torius did likewise and motioned his pirates to split into two\
  \ squads, one with Grogul and one with himself. He could see now that the arching\
  \ mouth of the cavern had been fashioned with stonecutting tools, though it was\
  \ so ancient and cracked that it had begun to look as rugged as a natural cave.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Neither do I.\" Torius peered into the darkness. \"Who's got the torches?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Indistinct murmuring was the only answer he got. Grogul looked abashed—\
  or as abashed as the half-orc ever looked, which wasn't much.</p> \n    <p>\"Didn't\
  \ know we'd be spelunking, Captain.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Well, we'll probably have enough\
  \ light from the cave mouth.\" Torius knew it was no good to chastise the bosun\
  \ now, but later ...He had another means to light their way if it got too dark,\
  \ but torches were good for more than light. \"Can you see anything in there, Grogul?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Nope. Too much light out here.\" The half-orc shaded his eyes and\
  \ shook his head. \"Maybe once we're inside.</p> \n    <p>\"Epok?\" Torius called.\
  \ He listened for a reply, for a hint that his man was still alive, for anything.\
  \ He heard a faint scratch that might have been a foot on stone, then nothing. \"\
  This stinks like ...\" Then he realized that he could detect something, but not\
  \ with his ears. The distinct scent of rotten meat wafted out from within.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Torius snapped his fingers to get Grogul's attention and, with simple hand\
  \ signals, outlined a cautious strategy; Grogul would proceed inside with his troop,\
  \ their backs against one wall, while Torius did the same down the other. Both would\
  \ keep a sharp eye out for traps or an ambush. Once inside, they would reassess\
  \ the situation.</p> \n    <p>They moved slowly, checking every step as they were\
  \ swallowed up by the cave's darkness. Grogul was the first to call a halt, his\
  \ sharp eyes penetrating the gloom far easier than the humans'.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Ssst! Captain!\" he called in a stage whisper. \"I think we found Epok.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"Gozreh's guts!\" Torius swore as his eyes became accustomed to the gloom.\
  \ Epok stood before them, one hand still clutching his cutlass, while the other\
  \ gripped one of the wrist-thick bamboo spikes that had impaled him. A wide frame\
  \ studded with sharpened stakes had swung down from above, propelled by a heavy\
  \ stone counterweight. It spanned the entire tunnel, and would have killed or maimed\
  \ several of his crew had they ventured inside with the unlucky Epok.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>\"There,\" Torius said, pointing to the thin trip cord that had released the\
  \ deadly trap.</p> \n    <p>\"Aye, and he wasn't the first.\" Grogul gestured with\
  \ his axe at the skeletal remnants of several other unfortunate trespassers. There\
  \ were at least half a dozen of them scattered along the sides of the corridor beyond\
  \ the trap, still wearing the tatters of their long-decayed clothing and clutching\
  \ rusted weapons.</p> \n    <p>\"Well, we're not going to join the club. Come on,\
  \ and everyone watch your step!\" Torius advanced, cutlass thrust before him.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>They edged past the trap, flattening themselves against the rough-hewn\
  \ wall to pass. Grogul had to nudge the thing to fit his thick torso through the\
  \ gap, causing Epok's gape-mouthed corpse to sag on the spikes. Torius swallowed\
  \ hard. Epok had been a solid pirate. Passing the frame, he noticed the condition\
  \ of the device; though not green, the bamboo was far from old. The island wasn't\
  \ as deserted as he'd expected.</p> \n    <p>When the last of his squad had passed,\
  \ they formed up again, advancing slowly. Enough light trickled in from the cave\
  \ mouth to show that the tunnel widened ahead. Then their rear guard gave a startled\
  \ gasp and cried out.</p> \n    <p>\"Captain! Epok! He's not dead!\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  What?\" Torius turned, his free hand reaching for the curative potion he'd brought\
  \ from the ship. Torius knew death when he saw it, and Epok had looked as dead as\
  \ dead gets. But true to the pirate's claim, Epok was moving, struggling to free\
  \ himself of the murderous spikes thrust through his chest. Judri, the tall Mwangi\
  \ woman who had called out, moved to help her comrade. \"Wait!\"</p> \n    <p>Epok's\
  \ hand lashed out to grab her tunic, while his other lifted his cutlass to strike.\
  \ Judri gaped in shock as the sword thrust through the bamboo frame, ill-aimed but\
  \ accurate enough to pierce her shoulder. Her scream echoed around the cavern as\
  \ Epok drew his weapon back for another strike.</p> \n    <p>Torius dashed back,\
  \ sword raised, but Grogul beat him there. The bosun's heavy axe smashed through\
  \ Epok's arm, the bamboo frame, and into the animated corpse's torso. Judri stumbled\
  \ back, but the zombie—Torius could no longer think of it as Epok—wasn't through\
  \ yet. It thrust clumsily at Grogul, the cutlass scoring a line on the half-orc's\
  \ arm. Grogul growled a curse, snatched its wrist and bent the arm over the frame\
  \ until the elbow joint popped and bent backward. He wrenched his axe free and severed\
  \ the other arm with a chop. The zombie still fought to free itself, but literally\
  \ disarmed, its struggles were futile.</p> \n    <p>Torius went to Judri. The wound\
  \ was deep, and right in the shoulder joint. It was hardly mortal, but would ruin\
  \ her sword arm for good if it wasn't tended properly. He flipped the stopper from\
  \ the bottle and pressed it to her lips. \"Drink!\"</p> \n    <p>Judri complied\
  \ and the wound in her shoulder closed immediately. Then her eyes widened and she\
  \ pointed behind Torius. \"Captain!\"</p> \n    <p>\"We got trouble, Captain,\"\
  \ Grogul growled, reaching down to hoist the injured woman to her feet.</p> \n \
  \   <p>Not three feet away, the bony remnants of the trap's previous victims twitched\
  \ and clawed their way to their feet, their rusted swords and axes clutched in fleshless\
  \ fingers.</p> \n    <p>\"Defensive formation! Now!\" Torius flicked up Judri's\
  \ fallen cutlass with the toe of his boot, caught it and put the hilt in her hand.\
  \ \"Everyone! And watch your backs!\"</p> \n    <p>The veteran pirates formed a\
  \ double row in close formation, half facing the scrabbling skeletons, the other\
  \ half guarding against the darkness of the corridor behind them. This way, Torius\
  \ figured, they could defeat the skeletons and then face whatever menace might await\
  \ them farther down the corridor without worrying about a threat at their backs.\
  \ At least, that was the theory.</p> \n    <p>At the first clash of blades, however,\
  \ theory and practice diverged as the moaning wail of new assailants echoed in the\
  \ dark behind them.</p> \n    <p>\"Damn but this is a pretty trap!\" Torius said\
  \ between clenched teeth. \"I'm going to have a few terse words for Celeste when\
  \ we get back to the ship.\"</p> \n    <p>\"<i>If</i> we get back, you mean.\" Grogul\
  \ deflected a skeleton's axe, then smashed his attacker to shards with a powerful\
  \ overhead chop. He glanced toward the dim corridor behind them, wrinkled his nose,\
  \ and spat. \"Zombies. Lots of 'em. Gods, I hate zombies.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Gozreh's\
  \ guts!\" Torius parried a blade and gave a deft twist. The fine cutlass snicked\
  \ through the skeleton's forearm like a piece of kindling, but the monster raked\
  \ him with its free hand, leaving bloody trails down his forearm. The crewman to\
  \ his left smashed a boarding axe down through its skull, and it toppled. At least\
  \ they were fragile. He spared a glance over his shoulder and saw the crowd of zombies\
  \ shambling out of the darkness. Some were armed and some weren't, but their eyes\
  \ gleamed with the maniacal, hungry look shared by all undead. \"This is <i>not</i>\
  \ my dream's desire!\"</p> \n    <p>\"Unless you've been havin' some pretty weird\
  \ dreams,\" Grogul agreed, hacking down another skeleton.</p> \n    <p>\"Not even\
  \ in my nightmares would I desire this!\" Torius parried and slashed low, severing\
  \ his opponent's spine just below the empty rib cage. The skeleton went down, but\
  \ still managed to clutch at his legs. \"Forward! Take down the skeletons before\
  \ we have to fight on both sides!\"</p> \n    <p>The pirates focused their attacks,\
  \ smashing with a vengeance at their bony adversaries in an effort to beat them\
  \ down before the shambling zombies arrived. Already Torius could hear the slow\
  \ scuff of rotting feet against the stone floor and smell the rank stench of decaying\
  \ flesh.</p> \n    <p>Finally, the last skeleton fell under a flurry of blades and\
  \ the pirates turned to face their new foes. Aside from a few scratches and one\
  \ shallow cut, they were all hale and ready. Torius and Grogul pushed through to\
  \ stand in the front of their double line.</p> \n    <p>\"Now we'll see what's what!\"\
  \ Grogul said with a tusky grin, swinging his axe from a center position where he\
  \ could do the most damage.</p> \n    <p>\"Watch our flanks!\" Torius ordered. \"\
  And aim for their joints. Take them down, then finish them on the ground!\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>He tensed, listening to the muttered curses of his crew. They knew there\
  \ was no retreat. The trap grating was as effective as a portcullis; if they tried\
  \ to squeeze past while being mauled by the zombies, people would die, and if Epok's\
  \ sudden animation was any clue, each fallen pirate meant a new foe. Their only\
  \ hope was to find whatever had animated the dead and destroy it.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Ready!\" he yelled, brandishing his cutlass.</p> \n    <p>\"Aye, Captain!\" his\
  \ crew cried out, and Torius felt his heart lift.</p> \n    <p>\"All right! On my\
  \ word!\" The undead shambled relentlessly forward. \"Now!\"</p> \n    <p>The pirates\
  \ lunged as one, their blades cleaving the zombies with a predictably sickening\
  \ result. Putrid flesh spattered the floor and walls of the corridor, and the stone\
  \ underfoot quickly became slick with the foul suppuration that seeped from their\
  \ wounds. Several of the undead went down, but others swung their rusted weapons\
  \ or grappled and clawed at the pirates.</p> \n    <p>Torius slashed, aiming for\
  \ their joints, trying to sever the limbs that reached for him. He had just downed\
  \ one zombie and turned to the next when everything suddenly went black, as if someone\
  \ had rolled a huge boulder across the cavern's mouth.</p> \n    <p>\"Back!\" Torius\
  \ commanded, disengaging from his opponent and fighting to maintain his orientation.\
  \ \"Everyone step back!\"</p> \n    <p>One step, then two, and he could see again.\
  \ A wall of darkness so thick Torius doubted he could swing his blade through it\
  \ loomed before them, but the zombies emerged unimpeded from the black, sloughing\
  \ forward, their clawlike hands outstretched. Then, to Torius's horror, the darkness\
  \ advanced with them.</p> \n    <p>\"Gotta take out whatever's doin' that!\" Grogul\
  \ suggested, hefting his axe. \"If they pin us against that grating, we're meat!\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"We'll have to run it.\" Torius looked at his crew, gauging their\
  \ morale. By their dubious faces, he knew they couldn't do it, not with any hope\
  \ of getting through. But someone had to. \"You and me, Grogul! The rest of you,\
  \ form a defensive line. If we don't win through, get back to the ship.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>The pirates shouted, \"Aye, sir!\" in unison; they'd stand as long as they\
  \ could.</p> \n    <p>\"Now, Grogul!\"</p> \n    <p>\"Aye, Captain!\"</p> \n   \
  \ <p>They charged into the darkness.</p> \n    <p align=\"center\"><b>Want more?\
