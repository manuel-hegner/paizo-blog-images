  \ all of our community a happy Pride month! As many of you know, during the month\
  \ of June people across the world celebrate people in the LGBTQIA+ community being\
  \ out and proud. The gaming community is full of wonderful queer folk who came to\
  \ the hobby to find community with those that share their geeky interests and explore\
  \ various identities through their characters and other characters who populate\
  \ the worlds in which they play. </p> \n     <p>We here at Paizo strongly feel that\
  \ gaming is for everyone, and staff and contributors have always worked hard to\
  \ include a diverse cast of characters in our works to represent the reality of\
  \ the gaming community. For this blog, I asked our staff and contributors to share\
  \ some of their experiences being nerdy and queer, and we’re happy to share these\
  \ voices and points of view from some of our community in their own words. Read\
  \ along and happy Pride Month to everyone! </p> \n     <br clear=\"all\"> \n   \

  \ inclusion of such characters in their products. It is a refreshing change from\
  \ almost every other type of media, especially games media. These characters are\
  \ simply living their lives in Golarion. They have hopes and fears and dreams and\
  \ partners and jobs and debts and faiths and feats and classes and memorized spells,\
  \ and their gender identity and sexuality are secondary to all of that. They are\
  \ complex individuals, not tropes or tokens, existing in Golarion the same way LGBQTIA+\
  \ people do in the real world. They belong, and this helps remind me that I belong\
  \ too; both in Golarion, and here on Earth.</p> \n     </blockquote> <span style=\"\

  \     <p></p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p> Talking about being asexual is challenging\
  \ for me; I’ve identified publicly as asexual/heteroromantic for about a year, privately\
  \ for about two years before that, and have been questioning on and off since eighth\
  \ grade. While I’m normally quite talkative, I spent well over half my life not\
  \ having words to describe myself. If you had told me five years ago that I’d be\
  \ writing a piece on being queer on Paizo’s community blog, I’d have called you\
  \ a liar. The notion of being asexual was never really an option for me—I had a\
  \ couple girlfriends, and while I never felt a drive to be in a relationship, I\
  \ knew I could feel romantic attachment towards women. You see, I didn’t learn that\
  \ sexual attraction and romantic attraction were different things until about three\
  \ years ago, and once I did, I had my answer for who I was. Its why I think it’\
  s so important to get good representation in everything from television shows to\
  \ roleplaying games—the more places where ideas regarding diverse identities exist,\
  \ the more likely it is that people who are questioning will discover words that\
  \ make their personal identities feel valid. Otherwise questioning people are left\
  \ feeling broken or worthless when nothing could be more wrong.</p> \n      <p>\
  \ I think that Paizo’s work in giving voice to diverse people is so important because\
  \ tabletop RPGs are often a place where questioning people can build characters\
  \ that help them understand themselves. I don’t have a single queer friend who didn’\
  t “playtest” a queer character before they came out IRL. For me, it was kitsune.\
  \ Every one of my developers seems to know all about how much I enjoy playing and\
  \ writing Pathfinder kitsune, but I don’t think many of them know why. For me, the\
  \ kitsune ancestry is the perfect analog of being asexual. Here you are, this glorious,\
  \ fantastic person living in a world where life is so much easier when you’re a\
  \ socially accepted human. But you have an “ace” up your sleeves—it’s easy for you\
  \ to pretend to be one of them, so you do it. Sure, people sometimes ask awkward\
  \ questions, but you go through the motions and give generic answers. “I’m focusing\
  \ on my career,” “I haven’t found the right person,” “I guess I’m in a dry spell.”\
  \ You play off expectations, and they’re happy to assume you’re one of them. But\
  \ keeping the secret from your party in a cooperative game is tough. Really, really\
  \ tough. Eventually you tell them or they find out, and it becomes the party secret.\
  \ It helps you realize that if you surround yourself with friends and family who\
  \ love and respect you, they’ll love and respect you in both your forms. Human and\
  \ kitsune, heterosexual-passing and ace. I don’t know if I would have had that without\
  \ Pathfinder.</p> \n     </blockquote> <span style=\"border-top: 1px solid #fff;\
