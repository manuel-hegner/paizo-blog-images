  \    </div> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Hi, folks! Logan\
  \ here. We’ve had some time to look over the survey results and messageboard posts\
  \ after the <em>Secrets of Magic</em> playtest concluded, and had team discussions\
  \ about potential changes ahead. Thanks to everyone who participated in the playtest,\
  \ playing characters, finding problems, taking surveys, and giving feedback! We\
  \ wanted to give you a bit of an idea of the direction we’re looking at taking the\
  \ magus and summoner for the final book. Not everything here is set in stone, though.\
  \ We still have rewrites to do, more internal conversations to have, and additional\
  \ data to look at. There are also hundreds of little things we’ll be changing, from\
  \ individual feats to story elements—this blog is just hitting the main points.\
  \ And, hey, if you stick around to the end of the blog, we have an extra treat for\
  \ you!</p> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/a8091709-8273-4fda-bb15-fadf571eb90a/playtest_magus_1080.png\"\

  \ \n     <h2>Magus</h2> \n     <p>Much of the feedback on the magus indicated that\
  \ it felt too restrictive and too random. The class could be quite powerful, but\
  \ required really specific play patterns and choices to get there. We don’t want\
  \ a class that can do a huge nova attack if you stack your <em>true strikes</em>\
  \ correctly but isn’t satisfying for doing much else. Our focus for further magus\
  \ development will be adding more varied strategies, making the action economy less\
  \ difficult to deal with, and giving more clear paths to build toward what you want\
  \ your magus to do. </p>\n     <p><b>Striking Spell</b>: This ability, unsurprisingly,\
  \ was the focus of much of the conversation from the playtest. In surveys, it was\
  \ rated as being interesting, but not powerful enough. It was also rated as being\
  \ difficult to understand. Players noted that it could be frustrating to spend your\
  \ whole turn casting a Striking Spell spell, then miss with the Strike. Even having\
  \ more chances at it didn’t take out the sting of needing to wait for another turn\
  \ to try again. Often, even if the spell came off later, the magus had missed enough\
  \ opportunities that it didn’t seem worth it.</p> \n     <br clear=\"all\"> \n \
  \    <p>Making changes to Striking Spell won’t be straightforward, and we still\
  \ need to do a lot of experiments to find something that’s fully satisfying. One\
  \ of the major drivers for the playtest version was making it highly flexible to\
  \ allow for using a wide variety of spells (compared to, say, Eldritch Shot) and\
  \ let you use your stored spell with other abilities (like Flurry of Blows or Power\
  \ Attack). Ultimately, these came at the expense of having a straightforward, solid\
  \ special ability that was dependable. And it also meant that many paths to doing\
  \ cool things required multiclassing, which leaves the class itself feeling lackluster.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>We know for sure that we want to restructure the action to make its\
  \ presentation clearer. We’re also going away from using a special benefit that\
  \ relies on a critical hit, as that led to the ability feeling too random and giving\
  \ too strong an incentive to load up on <em>true strike</em> and put all your eggs\
  \ in one basket. For actual effects of the ability, there are a lot of options on\
  \ the table, such as having a stored spell with a spell attack roll not increase\
  \ your multiple attack penalty, or going a bit farther and using the same roll for\
  \ your Strike and spell (similar to Eldritch Shot), or having some type of buff\
  \ you gain while you have a stored spell so you don’t necessarily want to use it\
  \ right away. Some changes might require Striking Spell to no longer be at-will,\
  \ so using it is a more impactful moment rather than repetitive. Lowering its frequency,\
  \ of course, requires some other tools to give your other turns that magus flavor.\
  \ We’re still workshopping ideas on that front.</p> \n     <p><b>Spells</b>: The\
  \ spell progression for magus has a total of four slots maximum. We knew the spell\
  \ progression would also be a major topic of discussion. Players were pretty divided\
  \ among which path to take, with about 40% of survey respondents happy with the\
  \ playtest path, and a wide variety of opinions about alternatives with no clear\
  \ victor. One of the common notes we saw was that the four slots didn’t allow for\
  \ many interesting or fun utility spells, but that the Martial Caster feat brought\
  \ some back in. To that end, we’re looking at adding a class feature similar to\
  \ Martial Casting around 7th level. That will link to our next topic...</p> \n \
  \    <p><b>Magus Synthesis</b>: Much of the discussion about the magus suggested\
  \ slide casting felt like a mandatory pick. In the surveys, while slide casting\
  \ was chosen the most, the selections were much more varied than we expected. And\
  \ beyond that, shooting star had the best numbers on the “fun scale.” With the intention\
  \ to make the action economy of Striking Spell more player-friendly, we also want\
  \ to make the synthesis options more distinctly focused on certain playstyles rather\
  \ than one appearing like a mandatory choice for action economy purposes. There\
  \ will likely be more syntheses coming, too, as we add options for the final book.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>We intend to give more of a story hook to syntheses, since they’\
  re currently a bit dry compared to similar options in other classes. These will\
  \ likely also come with some extra benefits that give a bit of a leg up to certain\
  \ playstyles, such as adding more spells to your spellbook or influencing what you\
  \ get from the Martial Caster benefit, as noted above. We’re also planning to change\
  \ the name to avoid confusion with the summoner, who has had a synthesis option\
  \ since 1st Edition. Finally, we heard you when you said Raise a Tome doesn’t work\
  \ with the syntheses, and will be fixing that.</p> \n     <p><b>Spell Proficiency</b>:\
  \ This part is pretty straightforward. It was noted that the magus has a slower\
  \ spell attack roll and spell DC progression than the champion or monk can get with\
  \ their focus spells. The magus will be getting a faster progression.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>Battle Spells: The magus potency spell wasn’t that popular. People have been\
  \ asking for a special attack spell as a focus spell instead, particularly a 1-action\
  \ spell. We had avoided that for two reasons: first, if the spell is strong, fights\
  \ can end up really repetitive, and second, we had intended for cantrip choice and\
  \ their use to be an important part of playing a magus. Cantrips ended up not feeling\
  \ like a good enough value to be worth using with Striking Spell, though. The battle\
  \ spell will be changing from magus potency, but the specifics aren’t settled yet.\
  \ It might be an attack spell with a Striking Spell benefit; it might be based on\
  \ your synthesis if those would benefit from being differentiated in this way—this\
  \ depends a lot on how the rest of the class shakes out and we won’t have a clear\
  \ answer for a while yet.</p> \n     <p>And now I’ll turn this over to Mark to talk\
  \ about the summoner!</p> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com//a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/a5639f7f-de9f-4346-8539-f973eb5b0493/playtest_summoner_1080.png\"\

  \ \n     <h2>Summoner</h2> \n     <p>Hi everyone, Mark Seifter here for a post-playtest\
  \ report for the summoner class. First of all, thanks to everyone who participated\
  \ in the summoner playtest, running games, posting playtest results and analysis,\
  \ answering surveys, and more! The summoner class had quite a bit of online interaction\
  \ this time around, and there were a lot of interesting and cogent discussions with\
  \ many good points made by folks with differing opinions. </p> \n     <p>Overall\
  \ people really liked the summoner, with the second highest overall approval after\
  \ the swashbuckler, but there were also some pitfalls, from small to moderate, that\
  \ people were looking to see fixed, and they all interact in different ways, which\
  \ makes it a little harder than for the magus to go into great detail on what changes\
  \ will happen. Finding a fix for a new issue might require revisiting our decision\
  \ for one we had an idea of how to solve.</p> \n     <br clear=\"all\"> \n     <p><b>Main\
  \ Takeaways</b>: Some outcomes are clear. We’re strongly leaning toward changing\
  \ Act Together to a variable-action activity, allowing either the summoner or eidolon\
  \ to use a 1-, 2-, or 3-action activity and the other to use a single action. The\
  \ summoner will be getting proficiency increases to spell attack roll and spell\
  \ DC sooner, just like the magus. We also want to allow more customization of your\
  \ eidolon at 1st level without loading up too many choices to make, so we’re leaning\
  \ towards more evolutions being available at 1st level and giving you a free evolution\
  \ to choose from at 1st level. We’re also looking into a few other avenues to potentially\
  \ increase versatility—but there’s an upper limit on how complex the class can be,\
  \ so there’s likely to be a process where we add and subtract things until we’re\
  \ satisfied. As such, I don’t want to get too specific in case it changes.</p> \n\
  \     <p><b>Eidolon Types</b>: We plan to increase from the four eidolon types presented\
  \ here to between eight and 10 eidolon types in the final version. Expect them to\
  \ be chosen from among the ranks of the eidolon types mentioned, but not presented,\
  \ in the playtest, such as fey and demon eidolons.</p> \n     <p><b>Spellcasting</b>:\
  \ One issue that had a lot of discussion was how to handle spellcasting, whether\
  \ to keep it the same, remove spell slots for other options like eidolon abilities\
  \ or focus spells, increase spell slots and weaken the eidolon’s offense, or take\
  \ a different approach. Based on the plurality of responses in favor of keeping\
  \ the spellcasting the way it currently works, we are leaning towards that option.\
  \ We’ve seen some positive playtest results with regards to diverse spell selection\
  \ and usage.</p> \n     <p><b>Synthesis</b>: There was a lot of feedback on the\
  \ Synthesis feat that allowed you to merge with your eidolon; it was popular but\
  \ many folks said that being an option you choose each time you Manifest rather\
  \ than mandatory didn’t fulfill the fantasy and that the ability to use both options\
  \ caused it to have quite a few restrictions it might not need otherwise. Right\
  \ now we are leaning towards changing the feat’s name and flavor to be clear that\
  \ it is meant for an optional ability, and then make the synthesist a class archetype\
  \ in a later book, with trade-offs based around having only the option to merge\
  \ with the eidolon, not to Manifest it normally.</p> \n     <h2>Incarnate Spell\
  \ Preview</h2> \n     <p>That’s a lot to read, so let’s finish things off with a\
  \ preview of a new type of “mega summoning” wherein you summon a powerful thematic\
  \ creature that sticks around briefly and has a big impact! This is still early\
  \ in the process, so any elements of this, including names, might still change.\
  \ And because this is just a preview, don’t go trying to use this in Pathfinder\
  \ Society! Though if I were your home GM and you gave me some cookies, I’d allow\
  \ it, personally.</p> \n     <h3>Incarnate Trait</h3> \n     <p>A spell with the\
  \ incarnate trait operates as follows, rather than conjuring a minion with the summoned\
  \ trait and allowing you to direct its actions. When summoned, the incarnate creature\
  \ takes its Arrive action. At the end of your next turn, the summoned creature can\
  \ either Step, Stride, or take the action for another movement type it has (such\
  \ as Climb or Burrow), and then takes its Depart action. Then the spell ends.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>An incarnate spell directs its effects away from you and your allies\
  \ as much as possible. The incarnate spell’s effect is not quite a creature. It\
  \ can’t take any other actions, nor can it be targeted or harmed by Strikes, spells,\
  \ or other effects unless they would be able to target or end a spell effect (such\
  \ as dispel magic). It has a size for the purposes of determining its placement\
  \ for effects, but does not block movement. If applicable, its effects use your\
  \ spell DCs and spell attack roll modifier.</p> \n     <h4>Summon Vengeful Dead\
  \ — Spell 7</h4> \n     <p><b>Incarnate, Necromancy</b></p> \n     <p><b>Traditions</b>\
  \ divine, occult<br> <b>Cast</b> [three-actions] material, somatic, verbal<br> <b>Range</b>\

  \ by your enemies and allies alike. This amalgam manifests as a large tornado of\
  \ insubstantial, howling faces. It occupies the space of a Huge creature and has\
  \ a Speed of 60 feet.</p> \n     <p><b>Arrive</b> (negative) All enemy creatures\
