  \    <p itemprop=\"description\">Order of the Amber Die here, back with our eighth\
  \ project since 2014! In case you aren’t familiar with our work from past projects,\
  \ we’ll give you the staccato version. We only play published adventures. We use\
  \ the complete rules set. We’ve had the same GM since our founding: 1987. We like\
  \ to push the envelope of tabletop roleplaying. We only play marathon sessions—\
  days at a time. We’ll play on location. Our GM isn’t afraid to kill characters or\
  \ TPK us; he’ll do it in front of the community, too. Imagine us <a href=\"http://knowdirectionpodcast.com/2019/10/joining-order-of-the-amber-die/\"\
  >like a roleplaying team</a>, complete with a captain to help the players. We revere\
  \ one d20 above all others, and that is the Amber Die. It doesn’t roll more 20s\
  \ than it should, but it chains them when it does, and doubters have always been\
  \ converted. After more than 150 adventures, we’ve even gotten rid of RPG absolutes:\
  \ yeah, we’ll split the party.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\

  >The Abomination Arsenal</a>, 2022</p> \n     <br> \n     <center>\n      <h3> The\
  \ Arsenal</h3>\n     </center> \n     <p>In our previous projects for Paizo, we’\
  ve always played iconic characters, and we’ve always put our own spin on things.\
  \ For The Giantslayer Endeavor, we tried to play the most amount of material in\
  \ the shortest amount of real time ever recorded. We succeeded, with an entire Adventure\
  \ Path played in six marathons across six months—fully documented, too. With The\
  \ Strange Aeons Experiment, we assembled a team of gamers who knew nothing about\
  \ Lovecraft or the Elder Mythos and sent them through the Strange Aeons AP to see\
  \ what would happen. The list goes on, but we’ll let you check out each project\
  \ as you may. </p> \n     <p>Instead of playing iconic characters again, this project\
  \ will be different: we’re playing our own characters, and going extreme with the\
  \ party. Early brainstorming around the release of <em>Guns &amp; Gears</em> had\
  \ us thinking that it would be cool to see a couple guns interact with a dungeon,\
  \ which is sometimes considered the “standard unit” of an adventure. As we kept\
  \ the ideas going, they shifted to this: Why have two gunslingers, when you can\
  \ have four? Why put them in a dungeon, when you can put them in a megadungeon?\
  \ Bring on the Abomination Vaults and pass the ammo! That’s right, no bows and spells\
  \ in this campaign—just guns. You want to play a cameo for a day with us? Gotta\
  \ be a gunslinger. You’re a friendly NPC offering free healing on our way back to\
  \ town? Nope, don’t mess with our chemistry. You’re one of the core four players\
  \ and Adam killed your character in volume two? Gotta be a gunslinger—a 1st level\
  \ one, now. </p> \n     <p>Sure, we could have played gunslingers in a firearm-themed\
  \ setting. This is OAD, though, and we like to be unorthodox. We wanted to see what\
  \ we could learn about the game and go where others fear to tread. Is party balance\
  \ really necessary, and how is a party of gunslingers going to overcome the vast\
  \ array of challenges inside a megadungeon? We have no idea, and that’s usually\
  \ where our Player Captain comes in. Matt’s been playing iterations of this game\
  \ since the early 90s and has seen a healthy share of high-level treasure hoards\
  \ in his time. He’ll get the party in shape for the first marathon and the launch\
  \ of The Abomination Arsenal. We do know one thing right now: we’re going into this\
  \ megadungeon fully strapped, always packed.</p> \n     <br> \n     <center>\n \
  \     <h3>Meet the Black Powder Cadre</h3>\n     </center> \n     <p>So many gunslingers\
  \ in one place needs some explanation, so we’ll give you the key points. Vlai Cafellyn,\
  \ Alkenstar outlaw and founder of the Black Powder Cadre, pulled off an infamous\
  \ heist at the Alkenstar Gunworks. While everyone might have intended to go their\
  \ separate way afterward, the authorities’ fierce pursuit ensured that the group\
  \ stuck together for protection. Over time, a bond developed, and the Black Powder\
  \ Cadre took shape. Their symbol is the harmona, a fey bird famous for sounding\
  \ like the biggest gun in the game. The Cadre’s color is blue—like the harmona—\
  and everyone wears a different shade. Vlai’s only rule for membership is that you\
  \ have to be handy with the steel. Lying low in Otari for a few months has depleted\
  \ their funds, and it’s time to explore the old ruins nearby in search of some profit…\
  </p> \n     <p>The core four members of the Black Powder Cadre can be found below.\
  \ Also listed are the names of each player and the year each became a member of\
  \ OAD (when a player has reached 100 session hours at our table).</p> \n     <div\

  \ Abomination Vaults:</h3>\n     </center> \n     <p>□ We still love being around\
  \ the table together and the setups that go with it. For our launch marathon, we’\
  ve got one of the sickest builds of any project so far: the Gauntlight ruins, completely\
  \ according to scale and fully 3D. Two photos on this blog only scratch the surface\
  \ of what our friend Morgan at Black Bard Studios can produce, so there are more\
  \ to come.</p> \n     <p>□ Another thing we love about being around the table is\
  \ our props. One of our members built an old-style ammo crate to hold extra copies\
  \ of <em>Guns &amp; Gears</em>, and maybe some of that tasty Otari coffee! During\
  \ one of our “you know what would be cool?” discussions, someone suggested a couple\
  \ of Nerf guns being custom-painted to look like the ones our characters use. Got\
  \ those now, too.</p> \n     <p>□ PCs show up with their own look for their character,\
  \ so Sean’s rocking a goblin mask for Maloika, and Karee’s wearing a set of half-elf\
  \ ears for Breen. In future blogs we’ll also see a cameo from our spellshot gunslinger\
  \ in a ghillie suit. Yup, he’ll be wearing the whole getup!</p> \n     <p>□ Since\
  \ we’re playing our own characters instead of iconics this time, we wanted some\
  \ portraits. That’s where our artist and prospective OAD member, Doug Handlon, comes\
  \ in. Our GM and Doug had classrooms down the hall from each other for years, though\
  \ you can probably guess which was history and which was art. Even as a cameo, Doug\
  \ has to play a gunslinger, so he’ll show up as the unexpected sharpshooter.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>□ We have a couple more cameos lined up: Theodora and Auralee from our\
  \ work with <em>The Slithering</em>. Theodora is in the ICU most of the time and\
  \ can start an IV faster than a 46 initiative roll—extremely useful in a marathon\
  \ if you’ve heard our stories. Auralee is studying psychology at Rutgers and won’\
  t leave us alone about getting into any Lovecraftian adventure we come across. Both\
  \ will play gunslingers, of course.</p> \n     <p>□ Our GM put together a custom\
  \ soundtrack, including a theme song for each level of the megadungeon, much like\
  \ he did for The Emerald Spire Project. Characters choose songs too, and we couldn’\
  t leave out certain NPCs and standout locations. </p> \n     <br> \n     <div class=\"\
