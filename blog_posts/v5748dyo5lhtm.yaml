  \ <p itemprop=\"description\">Our newst Pathfinder Adventure Path is about to drop\
  \ this month, and <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/hellsRebels\"><em>Hell's Rebels</em></a>\
  \ has two things Paizo fans love: fightin' against authority and swear words in\
  \ the title! It also has daring adventure, a huge variety of encounters from roleplay\
  \ and puzzles to devil-slaying and sabotage, along with a diverse cast of memorable\
  \ NPCs—both helpful and vile—scads of unique magic items, and a whole new system\
  \ for managing a secret society. But, we know what our readers really love: swear\
  \ words.</p> \n    <p><em>Hell's Rebels</em> kicks off this month with <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy98t9\">\"In Hell's Bright Shadow\"</a>, which takes PCs from their\
  \ humble roots as loud but ineffectual rabble-rousers to leading a true rebellion\
  \ against Cheliax's rule over the city-state of Kintargo and it's vile new lord-mayor,\
  \ Barzillai Thrune!</p> \n    <p>And not only does Barzillai have a haircut like\
  \ he hugs feral lawnmowers, not only does he dress like a recent convert to the\
  \ church of self-laceration, he doesn't even like mint! In his first week in office,\
  \ he issues not one but SEVEN proclamations, and sure some of them infringe on basic\
  \ personal rights and freedoms, but c'mon, who doesn't like mint?!</p> \n    <br\

  \ the Seventh: The odor and flavor of mint is an abomination to the refined palate.\
  \ Be not the cretin! Mint use in candies, drinks, and all manner of confections\
  \ is hereby proscribed.</i></p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Who voted for this\

  \   </div> \n    <p>Kintargo used to have heroes once! But sadly, most of them inexplicably\
  \ burned down just before the new lord-mayor arrived (because heroes have rotten\
  \ timing and are, apparently, highly flammable). Who will save the city from the\
  \ iron fist of the Thrice-Damned House of Thrune? What kind of maniacs would throw\
  \ their lives away challenging a scion of Cheliax's ruling house, backed by an army\
  \ of hellspawned goons (another swear word there for you; you're welcome)?! Only\
  \ Kintargo's stupidest bravest souls would dare try!</p> \n    <p>Crystal Frasier<br>\
