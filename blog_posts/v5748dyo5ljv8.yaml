  \ Rules and Pathfinder Rules</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Friday, June 2, 2017</p>\
  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Given the\
  \ ever-approaching release of the <a href=\"/starfinder\">Starfinder Roleplaying\
  \ Game</a>, there's no better time to highlight a few new Starfinder rules! Although\
  \ Starfinder is heavily based on the Pathfinder RPG system, there are nevertheless\
  \ some significant rules changes between the two. So to give you a quick taste of\
  \ some of the changes, here are five key mechanics that differentiate the Starfinder\
  \ RPG from Pathfinder.</p> \n    <p><b>1. Hit Points, Stamina Points, and Resolve\
  \ Points.</b> In Starfinder, Hit Points measure the health and robustness of a character,\
  \ while Stamina Points measure a character's readiness and energy (and can be replenished\
  \ far more easily). Whenever you take damage, your Stamina Points are depleted before\
  \ your Hit Points. In other words, you can soak up some hits without too much trouble,\
  \ but once you start taking damage to your Hit Points, you're taking physical wounds\
  \ that are much harder to heal quickly.</p> \n    <p>Starfinder characters also\
  \ get a third pool of points called Resolve Points, which represent grit and luck.\
  \ You can spend Resolve Points to power (or enhance) some class features, or to\
  \ help you stay in a fight longer. Resolve Points also determine whether or not\
  \ you die if both your Stamina Points and Hit Points are reduced to zero.</p> \n\
  \    <p>You can recover all of your Stamina Points by resting for 10 minutes and\
  \ spending 1 Resolve Point; Resolve Points and some Hit Points are replenished after\
  \ an 8-hour rest.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7101-CombatCharge.jpg\"\

  \   <p><i>Illustration by Pixoloid Studios</i></p>\n    </div> \n    <p><b>2. Armor\
  \ Classes.</b> Characters in Starfinder have two Armor Classes: Energy Armor Class\
  \ (EAC) and Kinetic Armor Class (KAC). Attacks that deal energy damage (like the\
  \ fire damage from your trusty red star plasma pistol) target EAC; attacks that\
  \ deal kinetic damage (like the bludgeoning damage from a gravity well hammer) target\
  \ KAC. Starfinder has no flat-footed or touch AC.</p> \n    <p><b>3. No Iterative\
  \ Attacks.</b> Starfinder characters normally get a single attack every round, and\
  \ this holds true from level 1 to level 20—a character's number of attacks does\
  \ not increase as their base attack bonus goes up. Instead, any character (even\
  \ at first level!) can use a full action to make two attacks in a round, each at\
  \ a -4 penalty.</p> \n    <p><b>4. Attacks of Opportunity.</b> In Starfinder, only\
  \ three things provoke attacks of opportunity: moving out of a threatened square,\
  \ making a ranged attack, and casting a spell. That's it. No other actions provoke\
  \ attacks of opportunity.</p> \n    <p><b>5. Magic is Magic.</b> There is no distinction\
  \ between types of magic in Starfinder, whether arcane, divine, psychic, or something\
  \ else. Spellcasting classes like the mystic and technomancer have different spell\
  \ lists, but are both harnessing the same latent magical energy that permeates the\
  \ universe. In addition, spells in Starfinder have no components; all you need is\
  \ the ability to cast a spell and concentration.</p> \n    <p>That's it for now,\
  \ Starfinders! Stay tuned to this space over the coming weeks and months for more\
  \ Starfinder previews!</p> \n    <p>Robert G. McCreary<br> <i>Senior Developer</i></p>\
