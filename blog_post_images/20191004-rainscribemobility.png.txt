| summary  = Rain-Scribe Mobility, Feat 10. Archetype. Prerequisites: Magaambyan Attendant Dedication, Rain-Scribes affiliation. You surround yourself in a mantle of Rain-Scribe magic and Stride twice; difficult terrain does not reduce your Speed, even if the difficult terrain has been manipulated by magic. Your magic clears the difficult terrain in each square you entered; until your next turn, those squares arenâ€™t difficult terrain for any creature walking through them (or are normal difficult terrain if they were previously greater difficult terrain).
