  artist: "artist Kevin Yan... While any spellcaster capable of casting planar ally,\
    \ planar binding, and binding spells can conjure and bind genies, the true genie\
    \ binder is a spellcaster who has devoted his life to the pursuit of this practice.\
    \ Most genie binders study the works of Sulesh the Great religiously, but the\
    \ best of them understand that even Sulesh wasn't infallible, and use his works\
    \ as stepping stones to further perfect the act of genie binding. While most genies\
    \ abhor the act of binding and bottling, many have an odd appreciation and respect\
    \ for actual genie binders. Nothing delights an efreeti more than to see a djinni\
    \ ensnared, for example, and the jann are quite pleased to see their elder brothers\
    \ and sisters brought low. Vadid and Nahk Preview Purloiners"
