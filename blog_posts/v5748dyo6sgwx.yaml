  \ \n     <blockquote> \n      <p>“Raia! Report status!”</p> \n      <p itemprop=\"\
  description\">Raia executed the last commands, feeling the change in the engine’\
  s thrum as the <i>Voidspear</i> shifted course. She cued her coms. “All right, I’\
  ve got good news and bad news.”</p> \n      <p>From far across the void, where the\
  \ <i>Sunrise Maiden</i> currently hid on the far side of the moon, Navasi said,\
  \ “Why don’t I like the sound of that?” </p> \n      <p>“The good news is that I’\
  ve successfully rerouted the <i>Voidspear</i> into a decaying orbit. It should hit\
  \ atmosphere in three minutes and break up over the planet’s surface.”</p> \n  \
  \    <p>“And the bad news?”</p> \n      <p>Something huge boomed against the door\
  \ to the bridge, accompanied by angry shouts.</p> \n      <p>“I’ll let you know\
  \ in three minutes.”</p> \n      <p>“Raia—”</p> \n      <p>“Just be quiet and let\
  \ me think, please.”</p> \n      <p>Navasi’s silence radiated disapproval, but at\
  \ least it was silence. Raia looked around the empty bridge, taking in her options.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>The original extraction plan was scrap. There were easily twenty drow\
  \ soldiers between her and the escape pods—far too many to fight past. And while\
  \ her security seal was holding for the moment, it was only safety in the most shortsighted\
  \ sense. She was bottled up on a ship that would shortly begin tearing itself apart.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Of course, she could always undo the course change. Set the ship back\
  \ in a stable orbit, wait for the drow to breach the blast doors, and throw herself\
  \ on their mercy.</p> \n      <p>“Yeah, right,” she whispered to herself. “No thanks.”\
  </p> \n      <p>She opened the captain’s internal hailing frequency, hearing the\
  \ tone echo throughout the ship.</p> \n      <p>“Crew of the <i>Voidspear</i>,”\
  \ she began, cool as a Triaxian glacier. “This ship will enter atmosphere and begin\
  \ self-destruction in two minutes—you can see the truth of this on your nav readouts,\
  \ or out the viewports with your own eyes. As your unauthorized pilot, I advise\
  \ you to abandon ship immediately.” </p> \n      <p>That earned her more shouts\
  \ from the hallway outside.</p> \n      <p>They wouldn’t evacuate, of course. Not\
  \ most of them—drow were notorious for their zealotry, and their matriarchs would\
  \ probably have any survivors executed anyway for losing a crucial warship like\
  \ the <i>Voidspear</i>. But at least she’d given them the option. She’d avoided\
  \ unnecessary loss of life as best she could.</p> \n      <p>Now for her own. Beyond\
  \ the viewport window, the planet loomed large, the curve of its horizon rapidly\
  \ flattening with proximity. Above it, the darkness of space beckoned, safety and\
  \ danger in equal parts.</p> \n      <p>All right, then—if she couldn’t reach the\
  \ escape pods, she’d just have to make her own.</p> \n      <p>First up: propulsion.\
  \ There was no point exiting the ship just to follow it down the gravity well. Letting\
  \ her eyes defocus, she summoned her magic and visualized what she needed. </p>\
  \ \n      <p>This was the part that always looked like—well, <i>magic</i> to the\
  \ uninitiated. And it was, but not in the way they thought of it. Technomancy wasn’\
  t about just making wishes or reciting incantations. You had to understand the mechanics\
  \ behind what you were doing, as clearly as if you were building something with\
  \ your own hands. Control circuitry, discharge chamber, ion accelerator grid, hollow\
  \ cathode neutralizer—every component mattered. Miss one relay or power processer,\
  \ and all you had was a fancy sculpture. Assuming you didn’t blow yourself up.</p>\

  \  </div> \n      <p>Green lines glowed in the air before her, a three-dimensional\
  \ wireframe technical drawing that expanded, gaining substance and heft, until the\
  \ glow disappeared and the completed jetpack dropped into her waiting arms. She\
  \ slapped a spare battery into it and watched the readouts light up. Fully functional.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Excellent. She slipped on the harness. </p> \n      <p>The next spell\
  \ was easier—one of the first any sensible spacer learned. Putting one hand to her\
  \ head, she formed a bubble of breathable atmosphere, extending the field down around\
  \ her body. Not a great way to travel the stars for any length of time, but at least\
  \ she wouldn’t immediately freeze, boil, or asphyxiate. </p> \n      <p>Alarms began\
  \ to blare throughout the ship. Beneath her feet, the deck shuddered as structures\
  \ intended solely for vacuum encountered their first fatal traces of atmosphere.\
  \ </p> \n      <p>Time to go. Raia stared out the window, fixing a point in mind.\
  \ Then she took a deep breath and cast the final spell.</p> \n      <p>Darkness.\
  \ Weightlessness. Agoraphobia slammed into her as her brain suddenly recognized\
  \ the lack of a ship’s comforting constraints around her. She fought down the urge\
  \ to panic, willing herself to continue breathing deeply. Slowly, deliberately,\
  \ she triggered the jetpack’s roll thrusters, spinning a hundred and eighty degrees.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Below, the <i>Voidspear</i> fell away from her, making its final dive\
  \ into the blue and white of the planet. Already, delicate struts were breaking\
  \ away, the hull glowing red with heat. As she watched, a single escape pod shot\
  \ free—deserters choosing to take their chances with the matriarchs.</p> \n    \
  \  <p>Good for them. Opening up her own engines to maximum, Raia accelerated hard,\
  \ climbing toward a stable orbit. As she did, she reopened her coms. “Raia here.\
  \ Mission complete.”</p> \n      <p>“Raia!” Navasi’s voice was gratifyingly relieved.\
  \ “Are you all right? Where are you?”</p> \n      <p>Raia looked around, taking\
  \ in the void stretching endlessly all around her.</p> \n      <p>“Well,” she said,\
  \ “I’ve got good news and bad news...”</p> \n      <p style=\"font-weight: bold;\
