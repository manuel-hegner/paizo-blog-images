  \ release date for Paizo's newest comics project, <a href=\"/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics/pfComicsVol3\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder: City of Secrets #1</i></a>! With a great story by rising comics\
  \ phenom Jim Zub, amazing art from newcomer Leandro Olivera, and the triumphant\
  \ return of removable poster maps with each issue's Pathfinder RPG appendix, the\
  \ new series is truly a cause for celebration.</span></p> \n     <p>So we're doing\
  \ just that! Starting today, Paizo has teamed up with expert Pathfinder Society\
  \ GMs to host special in-store Pathfinder RPG sessions at comic and game stores\
  \ throughout the next several weeks. This <a href=\"/pathfinder/comicInvasion\"\
  >Pathfinder Comic Store Invasion</a> features original encounters based on the poster\
  \ maps in the first issue. Participants will receive fun rewards they can apply\
  \ to new or existing Pathfinder Society characters. Check the <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/events\"\
  >events page</a> for a list of participating stores in your area.</p> \n     <p>Pathfinder:\
  \ City of Secrets #1 sees our familiar iconic heroes—Valeros, Seoni, Merisiel, Kyra,\
  \ Ezren, and Harsk venture to the city of Magnimar. Ezren seeks counsel with the\
  \ Pathfinder Society, hoping to bargain his research into the events of the comic's\
  \ previous volume into a field commission. This brings him to the offices of Pathfinder\
  \ Venture-Captain Sheila Heidmarch, a character familiar to players of both the\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/shatteredStar\">Shattered Star Adventure Path</a>\
  \ and many a Pathfinder Society scenario. </p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n      <a href=\"/image/product/catalog/DIA/DIA141086.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/product/catalog/DIA/DIA141086_360.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Kyra and Merisiel, following the events\
  \ of the recent <a href=\"/products/btpy930r\">Pathfinder Special One-Shot</a>,\
  \ seek out a famous abandoned shrine of Sarenrae in the shadow of the Irespan. There\
  \ they run afoul of another group of familiar villains—but that's a spoiler for\
  \ another day.</p> \n     <p>The familiarity Magnimar offers gives us plenty of\
  \ opportunities to tie the comic more closely to the Pathfinder world, and it's\
  \ been a thrill to read Jim's excellent scripts and see Leandro's spectacular art.\
  \ I'm glad that the gap between today's release and the <a href=\"/products/btpy915r\"\
  >final issue of the previous volume</a> gave us a chance to \"bank\" several issues\
  \ of finished art, as I'm terrified Leandro will be poached for a major title once\
  \ more editors get to see his phenomenal work. Best of all, he brings an eye for\
  \ detail that makes him particularly suited for the adventures of Wayne Reynolds's\
  \ iconic Pathfinder heroes.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderComics/DIA141088-1.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderComics/DIA141088-1_360.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n     </div> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderComics/DIA141088-2.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderComics/DIA141088-2_360.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Amid all of the call-backs to existing\
  \ lore, Jim Zub's script portrays the iconic characters with real emotion. We learn\
  \ more about their characters, motivations, and personalities in this series than\
  \ in previous arcs. We see Seoni wrestling with the responsibilities of leading\
  \ the group, Harsk's uneasiness amid the bluster and bustle of the big city, and\
  \ the development of Kyra and Merisiel's still-fresh romance. \n      <link>City\
  \ of Secrets offers lots of inventive battles against hideous foes, of course, but\
  \ it's also packed with genuine emotion and character moments for the whole cast.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>And the pull-out maps are back, thanks to your requests. The maps have\
  \ been among the most popular features of the line, and I'm thrilled to see their\
  \ return. The first issue features a map of Magnimar's Old Fang Tavern, a handy\
  \ little spot perfect for staging a bar room brawl.</p> \n     <p>I did just that\
  \ when I wrote the Tavern Brawl encounter for the \n      <link>City of Secrets\
  \ Comic Store Invasion event. Stop by participating stores to see how you and your\
  \ friends can help save the day when the bottles start flying and people start swinging\
  \ chairs. </p> \n     <p>The <a href=\"/pathfinder/comicInvasion\">Comic Store Invasion</a>\
  \ event packet also includes another encounter—also by yours truly—featuring a pack\
  \ of Pathfinder goblins attacking a modern comic store. Only the iconic heroes stand\
  \ to defend the sanctity of new comic book Wednesday! That encounter—and the modern\
  \ comic store map that goes with it—is available exclusively in the <a href=\"/products/btpy95c9\"\
  >Retailer Exclusive</a> edition of the debut issue. This extremely rare issue was\
  \ limited to stores that ordered 500 copies or more of the first issue. In the likely\
  \ event that your store placed a more modest order, you can always get the Paizo.com\
  \ edition of the Retailer Exclusive cover <a href=\"/products/btpy95c9\">right here\
  \ on our webstore</a>.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <img src=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderComics/PFC-HeroesLogo.jpg\" border=\"0\">\n     </div>\
  \ \n     <p>And did I mention the <a href=\"/pathfinder/heroesOfMagnimar\">Heroes\
  \ of Magnimar contest</a>? Hop over to the contest page to submit a 300-word description\
  \ of YOUR hero of Magnimar. A team of Paizo judges will select one character each\
  \ month to be illustrated by Dynamite's comic artists, and a chosen character's\
  \ stats will appear in the RPG appendix of each issue starting with #2 next month.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>So! Your mission today is to head over to your favorite local comic\
  \ store (or game store that sells comics, of course) and pick up a copy of <a href=\"\
  /store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics/pfComicsVol3\"><i>Pathfinder:\
  \ City of Secrets #1</i></a>! The better the comic does in this crucial first week\
  \ of sales, the more retailers will order of the follow-up issues, ensuring a long\
  \ future for Pathfinder comics.</p> \n     <p>The best way to ensure that future,\
  \ of course, is to <a href=\"/products/btpy8tvw\"> set up an ongoing Pathfinder\
  \ Comics subscription</a> right here at Paizo.com. Subscribers receive substantial\
  \ discounts on comic purchases, and can elect to have their comics bundled with\
  \ other Paizo subscriptions to save money on shipping. If you love the comics and\
  \ want to do whatever you can to help them succeed, subscribing is absolutely the\
  \ best thing you can do.</p> \n     <p>All of us here at Paizo put a lot of work\
  \ into the Pathfinder comics we produce. Your support means the world to us.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>To the comic store!</p> \n     <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p>\
