  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Thursday, May 29th, 2008</p> \n   <p>Here's another peek\
  \ at the forthcoming Pathfinder Module <i><a href=\"/store/v5748btpy80hx\">LB1:\
  \ Tower of the Last Baron</a></i>.</p> \n   <blockquote> \n    <p>It is speculated\
  \ that Asmodeus spawned the first crepitus devils, sometimes called magewretches,\
  \ to tempt and corrupt mortal wizards into damning their souls. Yet while it is\
  \ true that the crepitus is a highly intelligent creature with a gift for spellcraft\
  \ and all things arcane, its great intellect is countered by its foolishness and\
  \ inability to competently lure mortals to Asmodeus's will. As a result, specimens\
  \ seen on the Material Plane are more often slaves than fiendish tempters.</p> \n\
  \    <h2>Ecology</h2> \n    <p>A crepitus stands 3 to 4 feet tall, with bright eyes\
  \ in a saurian head that appears too large for its gaunt, rune-covered body. Its\
  \ shoulders sprout bat-like wings that allow it to fly with ease, and its sharp\
  \ talons are surprisingly nimble and capable of fine adjustments when conducting\
  \ magical rituals. A typical crepitus weighs 30 pounds. Though, like other devils,\
  \ crepituses don't require food, they take particular joy in consuming wizards'\
  \ familiars (and sometimes the wizards themselves.) Crepitus devils are native to\
  \ Hell, and many lurk around Asmodeus's infernal palace, often serving as messengers.</p>\
  \ \n    <h2>Habitat &amp; Society</h2> \n    <p>Left to their own devices, crepitus\
  \ devils are cunning, malicious pranksters, content to while away their days flitting\
  \ about Hell and tormenting lost souls and devils alike. Yet crepituses are rarely\
  \ left alone for long, and it is likely from this fact that their long-standing\
  \ racial hatred of wizards stems. Highly valued for their spell-like abilities and\
  \ intuitive knowledge of magic, crepituses are frequently bound into contracts or\
  \ enslaved outright by mortal wizards and other fiends, a situation the intelligent\
  \ devils find exrtemely demeaning. This situation is not helped by the fact that\
  \ crepituses are frequently the first gifts handed out by higher-ranking demons\
  \ attempting to seduce mortal magic users. If given an opportunity, a crepitus goes\
  \ well out of its way to destroy a wizard and burn his precious spellbooks to ashes\
  \ (not necessarily in that order). Chelish wizards regularly bind crepitus devils\
  \ as servants, and view having an enslaved crepitus as a mark of prestige.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Crepituses enjoy lording their power over their significantly weaker impish\
  \ cousins, and referring to a crepitus as an imp is the gravest possible insult.</p>\
