  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">September 24, 2010</p> \n   <p>Way back in August I began\
  \ to make some cryptic references to moving to the Emerald City of Seattle, leaving\
  \ the reasons why a mystery. People began to guess, but all was revealed a couple\
  \ of Tuesdays ago by Paizo as I was driving a rented U-Haul up the 5 from San Diego\
  \ to Seattle. Turns out I was relocating the Horde from sunny Southern California\
  \ to the green, and very wet, Pacific Northwest in order to work here at Paizo as\
  \ the new Marketing Manager.</p> \n   <p>What does that mean exactly? Well, I'll\
  \ be working closely with Erik Mona, our fearless publisher, making sure you the\
  \ fans know what we're producing, when it's coming out, what we're planning, and\
  \ other cools bits of news. In addition, I'll be working with the rest of the staff\
  \ in getting them on podcasts, interviewed by blogs and magazines, and out in the\
  \ wild spreading the glory of Pathfinder and Paizo.</p> \n   <p>I'll also be working\
  \ on some new ways of keeping you the fans involved in what we're doing and ways\
  \ you can help us out. So if you have any specific ideas, please leave them in the\
  \ comments below.</p> \n   <p>BTW, have you had a chance to look at our new FAQ\
  \ system? What we've done is put a link that says \"FAQ\" on messageboard posts.\
  \ If you hit this link it will mark the message, letting us know that there's something\
  \ you think we need to clarify, explain, or outright fix, and then have included\
  \ in the official FAQ for the product. Every message you flag for us will be brought\
  \ to the attention of our developers, letting them know someone has a question or\
  \ needs a ruling. (FYI, those with more \"flags\" will go to the top of the list.)\
  \ You can check it out <a href=\"/paizo/messageboards/paizoPublishing/pathfinder/pathfinderRPG/general/fAQSystem\"\
