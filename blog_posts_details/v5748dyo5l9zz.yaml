  artist: "its foolishness and inability to competently lure mortals to Asmodeus's\
    \ will. As a result, specimens seen on the Material Plane are more often slaves\
    \ than fiendish tempters. Ecology A crepitus stands 3 to 4 feet tall, with bright\
    \ eyes in a saurian head that appears too large for its gaunt, rune-covered body.\
    \ Its shoulders sprout bat-like wings that allow it to fly with ease, and its\
    \ sharp talons are surprisingly nimble and capable of fine adjustments when conducting\
    \ magical rituals. A typical crepitus weighs 30 pounds. Though, like other devils,\
    \ crepituses don't require food, they take particular joy in consuming wizards'\
    \ familiars (and sometimes the wizards themselves.) Crepitus devils are native\
    \ to Hell, and many lurk around Asmodeus's infernal palace, often serving as messengers.\
    \ Habitat & Society Left to their own devices, crepitus devils are cunning, malicious\
    \ pranksters, content to while away their days flitting about Hell and tormenting\
    \ lost souls and devils alike. Yet crepituses are rarely left alone for long,\
    \ and it is likely"
