  artist: "a chance invention, who hit the ground running and managed to make himself\
    \ a prince of the violent, vibrant world that is ancient Mars. Moorcock himself\
    \ has said that, in the early days of his career, he would sometimes only give\
    \ himself a few days to write a book, and in that seminal Michael Kane tale, we\
    \ felt that breathless pace—the prose light and quick, the images coming in fast\
    \ succession as Kane fought blue giants, cities of thieves, and vast subterranean\
    \ monsters. In its sequel, Lord of the Spiders, Michael Kane—yanked cruelly back\
    \ to Earth by his fellow scientists—manages to return to his adopted world, only\
    \ to find himself in a place (and perhaps time!) far removed"
