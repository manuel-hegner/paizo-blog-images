  \      <p>By now you’ve all learned which of the core 20 will be dying—Gorum. Many\
  \ of you may have characters that through one way or another draw power from Our\
  \ Lord in Iron, and I can imagine that you’re all wondering what this means for\
  \ those characters going forward. Our setting is one where dead gods don’t grant\
  \ spells, no matter how fervent their remaining believers. We’re also running the\
  \ Pathfinder Society Organized Play campaign in a living setting, and that means\
  \ that setting-altering impacts will happen, and that they will matter. So, starting\
  \ <strong>at Gen Con, August 1st 2024</strong>, Gorum will no longer be alive to\
  \ grant his faithful power.</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"\

  \      </div>\n      <br>\n      <p>What that means is that any character with an\
  \ option than relied on Gorum, such as a cleric, gets a free rebuild <strong>immediately</strong>.\
  \ You don’t have to use it right away, but if you want to play your character on\
  \ or after August 1st, you won’t be getting power from Gorum. I know many of you\
  \ have characters intensely devoted to the gods they follow, and I’ve seen some\
  \ really incredible Gorumites in my time volunteering for Pathfinder Society and\
  \ since coming on as a developer. You don’t have to erase that fervor though. Just\
  \ as we allow the reporting conditions for our scenarios to shape our setting, changes\
  \ to the setting can be a part of your character’s story. We have some of the most\
  \ creative players out there, and I look forward to seeing how you incorporate this\
  \ twist into the characters you play.</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n \

  \      <p>The death of Gorum is going to hugely impact the setting, but we’ll also\
  \ be releasing some Godsrain scenarios, so you’ll be able to play through some of\
  \ the setting-altering aftermath of Our Lord in Iron’s demise. I know some of you\
  \ will still be disappointed that a character you’ve put a lot into has to change,\
  \ but we can’t keep our promise of a living setting if we don’t have those setting\
  \ changes impact everyone. Though Gorum will be gone, your characters’ stories will\
  \ continue. And I can’t wait to show you some of the scenarios we’ve shaped around\
  \ this massive event, stories you’ll be able to contribute to because this is a\
  \ living setting.</p>\n      <p>But that’ll have to wait for another blog. So, to\
  \ reiterate, as of August 1st, Gorum will be dead, and any option explicitly receiving\
  \ power from him won’t work. Any character using such an option, like a cleric,\
  \ will receive a free rebuild. Until then, play your Gorumites’ hearts out.</p>\n\
  \      <p>Happy gaming everyone. It’s been a blast watching everyone’s theories\
  \ and reactions throughout this announcement process.</p>\n      <p style=\"margin-left:\
