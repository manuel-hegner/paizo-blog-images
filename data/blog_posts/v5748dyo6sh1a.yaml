  \ of the 1E Advanced Player’s Guide Arcane Blast feat . And taking the best advantage\
  \ of that power is the core of her strategy.</p> \n      <p>As always, I suggest\
  \ checking out <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh11?Core-Design-Seoni\">Keith\
  \ Richmond’s related article</a>, which discusses how Seoni evolved in the Core\
  \ Set.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/112919_CoreSetCharacterSeoni.jpg\"\

  ></a> \n      </div> \n      <h3>Core Set Seoni</h3> \n      <p><b>Best Skill:</b>\
  \ Charisma (d12)</p> \n      <p><b>Character Type: </b> Warrior, Arcane</p> \n \
  \     <p><b>Skills. </b> Seoni has three low-powered subskills—Arcane, Diplomacy,\
  \ and Knowledge—all running from +1 to +2. This is pretty typical for a character\
  \ with a d12 skill die, and Seoni’s d12 is one of the best in the game. Not only\
  \ does she use it for combat, as the basis of her Arcane skill, but she also rolls\
  \ her Charisma and Diplomacy starting at that d12! And if there’s something that’\
  s second best to a great combat skill, it’s a great Charisma skill, for attracting\
  \ allies, for talking some foes out of fighting, and even for closing locations;\
  \ Seoni has it all.</p> \n      <p><i>Weaknesses.</i> Seoni is another character\
  \ with a d4 Strength skill, which could be a deficit in combat, but like Lini, she\
  \ pretty much never uses it. That’s because she can always discard (or recharge)\
  \ a spell for her “arcane blast,” and if she’s out of cards… well then, she likely\
  \ has very little to lose to a failed combat. The rest of Seoni’s skills are pretty\
  \ average. It’s perhaps worth noting that her Knowledge skill is only d8+1, pretty\
  \ poor for a listed skill, but only Ezren and Lem share Knowledge in the Core Set,\
  \ so it’s still worthwhile.</p> \n      <p><b>Cards. </b> Unsurprisingly, Seoni\
  \ has a lot of spells (5). Beyond that, she’s pretty balanced, with allies (4),\
  \ blessings (3), and items (2). Her paucity of weapons (1) is irrelevant given her\
  \ arcane blast, but her total lack of armor (0) is more likely to cause problems—\
  and may drive Seoni to either hunt for armorlike items or adopt the Celestial Runecaster\
  \ role.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/12519-CoreBlessingShelynsSong.jpg\"\

  \ alt=\"Front face of the Varian character card showing skills for the Pathfinder\
  \ Adventure Card Game.\"></a> \n      </div> \n      <p><i>Blessings.</i> Obviously,\
  \ Seoni should look for Shelyn blessings, which help Charisma. Blessings that recharge\
  \ are also good choices, since Seoni doesn’t have any natural healing.</p> \n  \
  \    <p><i>Items.</i> The Gem of Mental Acuity is a great choice for Seoni with\
  \ her mighty d12 Charisma. Defensive items like the Bracers of Protection or the\
  \ Ring of Protection can help Seoni if she’s getting damaged too much, while rechargeable\
  \ Arcane items (which are limited to Wands in the Core Set) will be great for Seoni\
  \ if she selects the power feat that guarantees their recharges.</p> \n      <p><i>Spells.</i>\
  \ Obviously, if Seoni can collect spells that do more damage than her arcane blast,\
  \ she should; Fire Bolt is a fine, easy-to-acquire example (and more on how it stacks\
  \ up momentarily). However, Seoni should fill most of her spell spaces with utility\
  \ spells; that allows her to be much more versatile. If she needs to attack, she\
  \ can turn a utility spell into an arcane blast, otherwise she can use it for its\
  \ utility power. Clairvoyance, Enhance, Fly, Good Omen, Locate Object, Magic Eye,\
  \ Sleep, and Soothing Word are all great examples; choose specific spells based\
  \ on the needs and weaknesses of your party.</p> \n      <h3>The Power of the Arcane</h3>\
  \ \n      <p>Seoni is one of the simpler Core Set characters to play. Have no doubt,\
  \ her Arcane recharging power is powerful, but it’s also less subtle than some others.</p>\
  \ \n      <p><b>Use Your Arcane Blast as Appropriate.</b> Seoni’s arcane blast power\
  \ does d12+2 + 2d4 + the card’s level at the start of the game, which averages to\
  \ 13.5 + card level. She can increase it to d12+2 + 2d6 + card level (or 15.5 +\
  \ card level) only if she takes the Celestial Runecaster role. That means that its\
  \ improvement over the course of a campaign is largely dependent upon Seoni getting\
  \ higher level cards into her deck. Fortunately, that card-based improvement is\
  \ better than you might think: a +3 halfway through a campaign is about the same\
  \ as adding 1d6, and a +6 at the end of a campaign is almost as good as adding 2d6.\
  \ So even if d12+8 + 2d6 doesn’t viscerally feel quite as good as d12+2 + 4d6, the\
  \ two results are very similar (and of course Seoni will be adding even more bonuses\
  \ as she increases her Charisma).</p> \n      <p>All of that suggests that Seoni\
  \ will usually be able to use her arcane blast instead of a specific spell, which\
  \ is why she can stock up on utilities. But always keep in mind that powerful Attack\
  \ spells might be marginally better than arcane blast, which can be important when\
  \ Seoni goes up against a villain or henchmen, or when she needs a bit more attack\
  \ variety, which is why she should keep a few in her deck. Her starting Force Missile\
  \ is a fine example of a card that’s exactly as effective as her arcane blast, but\
  \ it has extra utility because it can be used to help other characters. The level\
  \ 1 Fire Bolt does d12+2 + 2d6 (or 15.5), which is one point better than if it’\
  s discarded for an arcane blast, which would do d12+2 + 2d4+1 (or 14.5); the differential\
  \ gets even more notable after Seoni gets a role, when Fire Bolt hops up to d12+2\
  \ + 3d6 (or 18). And, those Attack spells from the deck just get better over time.\
  \ Volcanic Storm is d12+2 + 3d6 (or 18) from the start, and it has a unique evade-on-fail\
  \ ability, while Seoni would only do d12+2 + 2d4+3 (or 16.5) if she used that spell\
  \ to power her arcane blast. So, there’s a difference, but it’s sufficiently small\
  \ that Seoni should mostly be relying on her native Arcana.</p> \n      <p><b>Improve\
  \ Your Arcane Blast as Your First Power Feat.</b> Being able to recharge spells\
  \ instead of discard cards in order to use Seoni’s first power is clearly a huge\
  \ plus. Discarding is a big disadvantage because it brings you closer to death,\
  \ while recharging is a huge advantage because it cycles your deck. Any power that\
  \ changes something bad into something good is clearly a must-have (and Seoni can\
  \ still fall back to discarding in the unlikely event that she runs out of spells).</p>\
  \ \n      <p><b>Take the High-Powered Spells (and Items).</b> Seoni’s second power\
  \ is that she can automatically recharge Arcane spells (and Arcane items if she\
  \ has the appropriate power feat—which is going to happen quickly, since she has\
  \ only two pre-role powers, though both are quite good). This means that Seoni should\
  \ push more than just about any other character to get high-level cards, provided\
  \ that they’re Arcane spells and items. It’s worth expending blessings to do so,\
  \ because she’s going to be able to use those spells to power her arcane blast or\
  \ for their high-level effects, all with automatic recharges. That means that she\
  \ can use them again and again, without ever losing them to the discard pile.</p>\

  \ width=\"500px\"></a> \n     </blockquote>\n    </div> \n    <h3>The Seoni Roles</h3>\
  \ \n    <p>Seoni’s Celestial Runecaster role is the simpler option, keeping her\
  \ high-level play comparable to her low-level origins. Her Dreamweaver role allows\
  \ for more subtlety.</p> \n    <p><b>Celestial Runecaster.</b> Quite simply, this\
  \ role makes Seoni better at combat. It can improve her arcane blast from +2d4 to\
  \ +2d6, which is a 2-point average swing, putting her blast on par with a lot of\
  \ Attack spells. And it also can give her 1 point of damage reduction against Acid\
  \ and Cold (and with a single feat, Electricity and Fire). The ability to reroll\
  \ dice at Sacred locations is yet another power that makes Seoni more dependable\
  \ for those high-level combats. So, this role is great for Seoni not only if you\
  \ want to keep her simple, but also if she needs to be one of your party’s heavy\
  \ hitters. This role can also give Seoni the ability to move an extra time each\
  \ turn—especially useful if Amiri is missing from your party.</p> \n    <p><b>Dreamweaver.</b>\
  \ This is a more subtle role that focuses largely on recharging cards. Seoni can\
  \ recharge cards at the start of her turn and after explorations (and can even help\
  \ local players to do so). If you understand the power of recharging, allowing you\
  \ to move quickly through Seoni’s deck to get her best cards back out, this is a\
  \ very fun role. Once again, this role also has a power that can help fill gaps\
  \ in your party: if you’re missing Harsk, Lini, and Sajan, you can pick up Perception,\
  \ and if you’re missing Fumbus and Merisiel, you can earn minor improvements against\
  \ barriers.</p>  \n    <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold;\">Keith\
