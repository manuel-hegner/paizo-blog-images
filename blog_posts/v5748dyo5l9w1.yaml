  \ a little background on this map.</p> \n   <p>Absalom is the idea of Jason Bulmahn,\
  \ lead designer at Paizo. He once studied to be an architect, but he felt there\
  \ was more fame and poverty in the world of professional game design. His years\
  \ of grueling apprenticeship to Henri Ringelheim, Master Architect of Stuttgart,\
  \ gave Jason a hunched posture and the inability to see in illumination brighter\
  \ than tallow candlelight, but from time to time he is able to tap into the small\
  \ amount of talent his master begrudged him, and create fine maps that are like\
  \ Archimedes’ lever for your imagination.</p> \n   <p>One such map is the rough\
  \ version of Absalom, City at the Center of the World. Note the square grid, a tool\
  \ used by all devotees of the draftsman’s pencil. The heavy black lines, representing\
  \ the cartographer’s stern intent. The green district borders and blue lines demarking\
  \ the edges of the ship graveyard, attempts to inject a moment of life and joy into\
  \ his work. The labels in red, representing the very blood he spilled to bring this\
  \ map to completion. You can almost imagine him pausing, pen in hand, to wipe the\
  \ sweat from his brow with an old rag, then patiently lowering his pen to the paper,\
  \ as the nearby candle sputters in the late hours of the night. This is the work\
  \ of one who loves his craft.</p> \n   <p>Plus, it almost looks like some sort of\
  \ weird crab monster.</p> \n   <p>Sean K Reynolds <br>Developer</p> \n  </blockquote>\
