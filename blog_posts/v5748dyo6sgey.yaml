  \ \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">To aid our community in scheduling their vacation,\
  \ I wanted to announce the main Paizo events now, along with committee chairs if\
  \ known. The Organized Play Foundation will call for volunteers, including GMs and\
  \ Department Heads, later this month. It is our intention to arrange timelines so\
  \ that volunteers know if they are selected well before housing lotteries or the\
  \ closure of ticket sales.</p> \n    <p><b>PaizoCon</b> - May 24 to 27 - Seattle,\
  \ Washington (Venture-Captain Louis Manko Levite)</p> \n    <p><b>UK Games Expo</b>\
  \ - May 31 to June 2 - Birmingham, United Kingdom (Venture-Captain Ian Hawthorn)</p>\
  \ \n    <p><b>Origins</b> - June 12 to 16 - Columbus, Ohio (Venture-Captain Michael\
  \ McNerney)</p> \n    <p><b>Gen Con</b> - August 1 to 4 - Indianapolis, Indiana\
  \ (Regional Venture-Coordinator Bob Jonquet)</p> \n    <p><b>PAX Unplugged </b>-\
  \ TBD Nov/Dec - Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (Venture-Captain Quinn Shannon)</p> \n\
  \    <h2>Campaign Coins</h2> \n    <p>In <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgdb?October-Update-Know-Direction-Spotlights-and#discuss\"\
  ></a>, I noted that I left two Campaign Coins in the care of a local venture officer\
  \ to hand out when they saw the recipient. One was given out at the Auckland PFS\
  \ BBQ, so I can announce that <b>Venture-Captain Glen Irving </b>received #804 for\
  \ his continued efforts on behalf of Paizo organized play in the New Zealand area\
  \ and as part of PaizoCon Asia-Pacific 2017. Congratulations, Glen, and thank you\
  \ for all your hard work and efforts on behalf of our Societies.</p> \n    <p>If\
  \ you know a deserving member of your community, please email me at <a href=\"mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com\"\
  >organizedplay@paizo.com</a>&nbsp;with their name, location, and the reasons you\
  \ feel they should be recognized for their service. If you are able, please include\
  \ what events they may attend in 2018/2019 so that we can either make awards in\
  \ person (preferred) or make arrangements for deliver.</p> \n    <h2>Stars and Novas</h2>\
  \ \n    <p>This month is the last opportunity to award 5 stars in 2018 and two individuals\
  \ fulfilled the requirements this month. To achieve this milestone, GMs run 150\
  \ games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios,\
  \ as well as run a game for a venture-captain. A conservative estimate of time needed\
  \ to reach 5-stars is 650 hours! To the GMs listed below, thank you very much for\
  \ the time and energy you spend running Pathfinder Society games! Huge congratulations\
  \ on your achievement!</p> \n    <ul> \n     <li>Jacinta Reed</li> \n     <li>Pete\
  \ Pollard</li> \n    </ul> \n    <p>On the 5 Nova front. Per feedback, we are keeping\
  \ much the same structure as our PFS stars. Requirements will include a set number\
  \ of games (most likely 150 for continuity), including some number of required special\
  \ events (probably 10) and a variety of scenarios (50 is the current benchmark for\
  \ PFS). Where it will differ is in the application of the Venture-Captain review.\
  \ This is still under feedback, both from a tech application and what the form of\
  \ the review will look like, and I hope to have more to share next month.</p> \n\
  \    <p>The votes are in and the symbol we will use for GM recognition in Pathfinder\
  \ Society version 2 is a glyph based on the Pathfinder Symbol of the Open Road.\
  \ Huge thank you to everyone who voted in our poll!</p> \n    <h2>Convention Listing</h2>\
  \ \n    <p>Looking at the list below, there are a few conventions left to attend\
  \ before the calendar flips to 2019. In addition, a few conventions occurring in\
  \ first quarter 2019 already submitted their event support request. I expect this\
  \ convention list to grow quickly after the first of the year!</p> \n    <p>If you\
  \ see an expected event missing from the list, ping the organizer and have them\
  \ submit a request for support or have them email me at&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com\"\
  >organizedplay@paizo.com&nbsp;</a>to discuss their event. All of the conventions\
  \ on the list maintain some type of web presence, be it website, social media page,\
  \ or Warhorn listing, so if you are interested in attending in either capacity,\
  \ check out their websites or contact the local venture-officer for more information!</p>\
