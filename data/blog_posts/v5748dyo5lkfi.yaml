  \ href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lkf2?Enter-the-Jungle-of-Despair\">Last week</a>,\
  \ I previewed a few of the figures from the forthcoming <a href=\"/products/btpy9y9m?Pathfinder-Battles-Jungle-of-Despair\"\
  ><em>Jungle of Despair</em></a> set of Pathfinder Battles miniatures from WizKids,\
  \ including the <a href=\"/products/btpy9y9j?Pathfinder-Battles-Jungle-of-Despair-Hydra\"\
  >case incentive Hydra</a>.</p> \n     <p>The mythical hydra's heads aren't the only\
  \ thing growing wildly in the depths of the jungle, however. Today, we explore some\
  \ of the verdant villains featured in the set, sure to seal player characters' floral\
  \ fates. That's right—plant monsters!</p> \n     <p>Among the most iconic plant\
  \ creatures in the game, and the bane of low-level adventurers everywhere is the\
  \ well camouflaged Murder Vine. All too often unsuspecting explorers stumble across\
  \ the remains of their predecessors, their treasures still intact, while hacking\
  \ through the dense foliage of a forest or jungle, only to discover that the vines\
  \ winding through the corpses are not so benign. This Large miniature, released\
  \ at the Uncommon rarity, features just such remains, certain to remind your players\
  \ of just how deadly a threat they're facing when it plops down on the battle mat.</p>\
  \ \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180129-MurderVine.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180129-MurderVine_180.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>While many would-be treasure seekers fall victim to murder\
  \ vines and litter the jungle with their desiccated bones, not all prey of predatory\
  \ plants are so lucky. Those who die at the tendrils of other mulchy menaces may\
  \ be infected by their seeds and raised as fungal zombies! The culprit of such nefarious\
  \ natural schemes is none other than the Musk Creeper, whose animated spawn not\
  \ only serve as protectors of their parent vine, but act as seed carriers when they\
  \ inevitably wander off into the jungle and die, creating a new plant to further\
  \ torment future explorers. The Musk Creeper is a Medium Uncommon figure.</p> \n\
  \     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180129-MuskCreeper.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180129-MuskCreeper_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Other plants, such as a particularly pernicious variety\
  \ of reddish brown mold, create not zombies, but intelligent pygmy plant men whose\
  \ primitive societies spread through the jungles of the world. These Mold Runts\
  \ hold their progenitor corpse, from whose innards they spring, wholly formed after\
  \ the subject dies from exposure to the mold, in almost religious reverence, and\
  \ often craft crude weapons out of the bones or equipment found on their birthing\
  \ corpse. While weak in small numbers, these diminutive plant people are truly a\
  \ force to be reckoned with in large numbers. The Mold Runt is a Small Common figure,\
  \ allowing GMs to easily collect multiple copies with which to overwhelm their players.</p>\
  \ \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180129-MoldRunt.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180129-MoldRunt_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Finally, another iconic plant makes its Pathfinder\
  \ Battles debut in <em>Jungle of Despair</em>: None other than the hulking Shambler,\
  \ whose formless bulk strikes fear into any explorer with even a passing result\
  \ on her Knowledge (Nature) skill check. Dangerous in its own right, a Shambler\
  \ exposed to electricity—either from a poorly planned magical attack, a natural\
  \ lightning storm, or a nearby nest of static-charged lizards—flies into a rampage,\
  \ absorbing the energy into itself and making it all the harder to bring down. Appearing\
  \ as little more than moldering heaps of rotting vegetation, Shamblers are especially\
  \ deadly when they infiltrate mulch piles and refuse pits, catching unsuspecting\
  \ victims in their constricting tendrils. The Shambler is a Large Uncommon figure.</p>\
  \ \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180129-Shambler.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180129-Shambler_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>But surely adventurers the likes and caliber of most\
  \ Pathfinder player characters will defeat these threats handily, right? Reducing\
  \ Shambler, Musk Creeper, and Murder Vine alike to little more than salad? Mmmm,\
  \ salad.* How about next week we look at something that goes perfectly with any\
  \ salad? I am, of course, referring to dressing!</p> \n     <p>Mark Moreland<br>\
  \ <i>Franchise Manager</i></p> \n     <p class=\"tiny\">*My wife, were she to read\
  \ this blog, would surely require I clarify that I have never uttered this phrase\
  \ before in my life, though she would like me to.</p> \n    </div> \n   </blockquote>\
