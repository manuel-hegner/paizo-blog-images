  \  <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">I wasn’t planning to hit you\
  \ with a weekly update when I started these, but things keep changing so quickly\
  \ and new information is reaching us almost daily, that I felt that you needed an\
  \ update, especially with our new April products scheduled to release in a few weeks.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>As many of you are probably aware, various shutdowns of nonessential\
  \ businesses across the world have left many brick and mortar hobby game stores\
  \ and bookstores closed for an indefinite period of time. Some stores are still\
  \ open, while others have pivoted to online sales, doing curbside pick-up, or even\
  \ hand-delivering game products to customer’s homes! If your local stores are finding\
  \ creative ways to get our products into your hands, please support them in these\
  \ tough times!</p> \n      <p>However, the temporary shutdown of many of these stores,\
  \ as well as local shutdowns of nonessential businesses, has forced most of our\
  \ distribution partners to close their operations temporarily. This means that most\
  \ won’t be ordering our new releases when they come out at the end of April unless\
  \ things improve before then. For the last three weeks, Amazon has stopped all restocks\
  \ of nonessential items to give their warehouses the opportunity to provide their\
  \ customers with essential products to get through this pandemic. To complicate\
  \ matters, even when Amazon starts restocking our products, the distributor which\
  \ sells to them for us has been shut down for who knows how long.</p> \n      <p>The\
  \ long and short of all of this is that it may be difficult for you to find our\
  \ new products while traditional distribution is mostly shut down. We are hopeful\
  \ about being able to open up our warehouse to start shipping products in a week\
  \ or two if the local situation continues to improve as it has lately (all while\
  \ practicing safe social distancing). So with a bit of luck, we will be shipping\
  \ all orders of new product in the second half of April, both for orders you placed\
  \ through paizo.com and for distributors and retailers that remain open. Hobby game\
  \ stores can also buy directly from us by registering their store at <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/paizo/retailers\">Paizo.com/retailers</a>.</p> \n      <p>If you\
  \ are interested in any of our new April products, then please reach out to your\
  \ local hobby game store to see if they will be stocking them. Paizo ships our e-commerce\
  \ all over the world, so if we are open to ship, then that is also an option for\
  \ you. And finally, for those that are interested in PDF versions of our April releases,\
  \ those should be available at the end of the month as usual.</p> \n      <p><b>April\
  \ New Releases</b></p> \n      <table width=\"100%\"> \n       <tbody> \n      \
