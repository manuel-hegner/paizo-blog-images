  ></a>\n      <br><i>Illustration by Wayne Reynolds</i>\n     </div> \n     <p>In\
  \ the nation of Geb, the dead far outnumber the living—and they hold the reins of\
  \ political power. Most of Geb's living citizens are slaves, chattel, or most gruesomely,\
  \ food for their undead overlords. Nyctessa was born into this world, yet she straddled\
  \ both sides of class and society, being a dhampir—the child of a vampire and a\
  \ living human mother. The heart of a living being beats in her chest, but her flesh\
  \ is infused with the negative energy that animates the living dead, and she inherited\
  \ her vampiric father's taste for blood. In the laws of Geb at least, Nyctessa was\
  \ neither wholly alive nor truly dead.</p> \n     <p>Nyctessa's father was one of\
  \ the Blood Lords, the undead necromancers who form the elite of Geb's aristocracy;\
  \ her mother, a slave concubine in her father's harem. Throughout Nyctessa's childhood,\
  \ both her father and mother were distant figures. She was nursed by loyal human\
  \ slaves, raised by ghoul governesses, and educated by vampire tutors. She was allowed\
  \ to see her mother only a few times a week, and her father even less. Nevertheless,\
  \ Nyctessa always remained aware of being groomed to be her father's heir. Everyone\
  \ expected her to follow in his footsteps, study necromancy, become a vampire, and\
  \ eventually perhaps, centuries later, inherit his position in Gebbite society and\
  \ government as one of the undying Blood Lords. She dutifully enrolled in Mechitar's\
  \ prestigious Ebon Mausoleum, the same academy of necromancy her father had attended\
  \ centuries earlier, and she excelled in all her studies.</p> \n     <p>When Nyctessa\
  \ came of age, the time arrived when she would be presented to Mechitar society\
  \ and join the social and political scene of Geb's capital city. Most of the young\
  \ nobles making their debut that night were the newly made spawn of penanggalens,\
  \ wraiths, vampires, and other undead, but some were the skittish, living offspring\
  \ of the few mortal Blood Lords who still clung to life. Nyctessa was the only dhampir,\
  \ and she could feel the mocking stares of her peers, judging her, pitying her even.\
  \ Neither dead nor alive.</p> \n     <p>In the early morning, before the sun rose,\
  \ Nyctessa's father presented her with a gift as the ball wound down: her mother.\
  \ Nyctessa knew what he expected of her. They embraced and Nyctessa sank her teeth\
  \ into her mother's neck. She greedily drank the blood, gorged herself on it, and\
  \ felt a heady rush of power as her mother's drained, lifeless body sank to the\
  \ floor. Her father watched in silence. Nyctessa had taken the first real step toward\
  \ becoming his heir.</p> \n     <p>Nyctessa returned to the Ebon Mausoleum to finish\
  \ her studies, but during that time, she could not help thinking of her mother's\
  \ death at her own hands. It was expected. Morality didn't even enter into it. Nyctessa\
  \ had been told over and over by her governesses and tutors that no life—or death—\
  equaled her own. Her mother had been chattel, and Nyctessa the scion of a noble\
  \ house. And her mother's blood had tasted good. Almost from the moment of her birth,\
  \ Nyctessa had been trained for one role, one destiny. Her future was planned out\
  \ to the tiniest detail. Only now, she questioned whether that would be enough.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>At her graduation, Nyctessa's father presented another gift: a staff\
  \ made from her mother's spine and skull with which to form her arcane bond. This\
  \ was the last straw, the last nail in her proverbial coffin. The staff was a symbol\
  \ of her father's power over her, over her future, and the rest of her existence.\
  \ She could not just allow him to steal all of that possibility from her. She would\
  \ not just be a pawn in his centuries-long strategies and political maneuverings.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Nyctessa left Mechitar that night, paying for passage on a ship to Jalmeray.\
  \ She took her staff with her, but did not say goodbye to anyone. Before she would\
  \ promise herself to death, she would see what life had to offer. Nyctessa journeyed\
  \ to Jalmeray, Katapesh, Qadira, and beyond to Taldor, Andoran, and Cheliax. She\
  \ left behind her family name, her father's name, and during these travels, she\
  \ witnessed life itself. A grubby, hardscrabble existence, always grasping for more—\
  more food, more money, more land, more meaning, only to see it all stolen away when\
  \ death inevitably arrived. A meaningless exercise, and always far too brief.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Nyctessa chose to live, but only until she had triumphed over life completely.\
  \ She would be one of the immortal, the eternal, the deathless, what mortals call\
  \ the living dead—eventually. She would return home and claim her birthright, but\
  \ on her own terms, through her own skills and abilities. She would not become a\
  \ mindless automaton, a starving ghoul, a thirsting vampire, or even a rotting lich,\
  \ but something different, something new, something uniquely Nyctessa. She would\
  \ do whatever it took. She would let nothing stand in her way. Nyctessa would find\
  \ the answer within herself and her magic, and she would forever bridge the divide\
  \ between life and death.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Rob McCreary<br> <i>Senior\
