  >Abomination Vaults Adventure Path</a>. I knew this campaign would be a big hit\
  \ from the start: it has old-fashioned kick-down-the-door dungeon exploration seeded\
  \ with interesting NPCs, side quests, and tons of roleplaying. The authors—James\
  \ Jacobs, Vanessa Hoskins, and Stephen Radney-MacFarland—really blew me away by\
  \ adding exciting action sequences and compelling character personalities to every\
  \ dungeon level. The Abomination Vaults present more than a place to fight monsters\
  \ and grab loot (although there’s plenty of that!), but an opportunity for heroes\
  \ to solve mysteries, negotiate old feuds, rescue innocent people, and much more.\
  \ And, of course, the villain lurking behind the scenes is a terrifying and powerful\
  \ enemy. She’s right there on the cover and, wow, does she look angry!</p> \n  \

  \    <p>This is perhaps the most approachable Pathfinder Second Edition Adventure\
  \ Path that we’ve made.</p> \n     <ul> \n      <li>It features a more focused scope,\
  \ taking characters from 1st level to 11th level (instead of all the way to 20th\
  \ level, as all our previous Pathfinder Second Edition Adventure Paths have done).\
  \ </li> \n      <li>It offers the heroes a clear “home base” in the town of Otari\
  \ that could be dropped into just about any campaign setting, Age of Lost Omens\
  \ or otherwise. </li> \n      <li>It extends the locale of the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/pathfinder/beginnerbox\"\
  >Pathfinder Beginner Box</a>, which has already attracted lots of eager new players\
  \ to the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game.</li> \n     </ul> \n     <p>With the Abomination\
  \ Vaults Adventure Path, experienced GMs have enough content to make their campaign\
  \ really shine, and newer GMs can trust us to give them something they can handle\
  \ that will amaze their players. </p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\

  \ <p>When we saw how much people loved the Abomination Vaults campaign—I was thrilled\
  \ to see so many people saying it was the best megadungeon they’d ever seen—we knew\
  \ it was destined for something special. The work to convert the campaign into a\
  \ hardcover was already going on when the first subscribers were still playing it.\
  \ I watched the Paizo forums I set up for each of the adventures, making notes about\
  \ errors to be corrected and rough spots that people found difficult to understand.\
  \ I filled my three volumes of the Adventure Path with dozens and dozens of sticky\
  \ notes, each one marking a place we could make the campaign better—such as by fixing\
  \ a reference to a room that didn’t exist, ordering some art that players felt necessary,\
  \ smoothing out the treasure progression, or replacing a certain foe’s 3rd-level\
  \ spell with one a little less (ahem) deadly.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ Beak. Illustration by Artur Nakhodkin</p> \n     </div> \n     <br> \n     <p>As\
  \ it turns out, no drastic overhauls of the campaign were necessary. That meant\
  \ I could really focus on how to make the campaign easier to run. This isn’t just\
  \ a reprint of the three adventures bound within a hard cover. It’s been reorganized\
  \ to make it even more usable and fun. As an overview, here’s what you’ll find inside:\
  \ </p> \n     <ul> \n      <li>We open with a synopsis of the whole campaign, including\
  \ the primary villain’s background, a timeline, and an easy leveling guideline:\
  \ “the dungeon level your heroes are on is the character level they should be.”\
  </li> \n      <li>Next, you’ll find a chapter detailing the town of Otari. As the\
  \ heroes’ home base and the source of numerous rumors and side missions, it’s presented\
  \ right up front. We included the new backgrounds and other rules from the standalone\
  \ <em>Pathfinder Abomination Vaults Player’s Guide</em> here, to put everything\
  \ in one place.</li> \n      <li>The bulk of the hardcover includes the next 10\
  \ chapters, each detailing one of the 10 dungeon levels. </li> \n      <li>We included\
  \ an article about the evil god lurking behind the events of the campaign.</li>\
  \ \n      <li>Near the end, an enormous Adventure Toolbox presents all the new items,\
  \ spells, artifacts, archetypes, and more. This toolbox also contains nearly 30\
  \ new monsters featured in the campaign!</li> \n      <li>I’m particularly happy\
  \ with the adventure’s final page, a Glossary that gives a short summary and location\
  \ for dozens of NPCs, groups, unique items, and more. This will help GMs keep details\
  \ regarding NPCs with similar names in mind, such as Vandy, Volluk, and Vethris.\
  \ </li> \n     </ul> \n     <p>Picking up the entire Abomination Vaults Adventure\
  \ Path in a single book is a fantastic way to bring this campaign to your table.\
  \ There’s a ton of support for it, too, from the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02d4z/discuss?Pathfinder-Abomination-Vaults-Battle-Cards\"\
  ><em>Abomination Vaults Battle Cards</em></a> to licensed products like <a href=\"\

  >Foundry Virtual Tabletop</a>.</p> \n     <p>I hope you have as much fun enjoying\
  \ this megadungeon as we did building it!</p> \n     <p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\
