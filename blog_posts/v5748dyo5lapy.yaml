  date\">Monday, January 4, 2010</p> \n   <p>Hey hey everybody! It's a brand new year\
  \ and we're already back at it. We're elbows deep in the next volume of Kingmaker,\
  \ the <a href=\"/pathfinder/v5748btpy88rc\"><i>GameMastery Guide</i></a> and <a\
  \ href=\"/pathfinder/v5748btpy8b6g\"><i>Advanced Player's Guide</i></a> are both\
  \ coming together, the <i>NPC Folio</i> is nearing completion, we got new Pathfinder\
  \ Society Scenarios up just before the new year, and a ton of other things we're\
  \ not quite ready to show off yet are simmering away. It's nice to be back in the\
  \ thick of things.</p> \n   <p>But more than anything, what's already floored me\
  \ this year are our fantastic players and readers.</p> \n   <p>In regards to two\
  \ bizarre personal items I, for some reason, prove especially particular: key chains\
  \ and calendars. I suspect it's because these are things I have to look at every\
  \ day, so I want things I'll more than just like. At the same time they're essentially\
  \ personal accessories, so they should also reflect their owner's tastes and character.\
  \ It's this kind of over thinking that typically means I have no keychain and often\
  \ leads me to go for years without a physical calendar.</p> \n   <p>Not this year,\
  \ though! I returned from my vacation to a package containing a flattering letter\
  \ and a calendar from one of the players in my Bastardhall Playtest from PaizoCon\
  \ '09. Aside from being a jaw-droppingly, spot-on, I-couldn't-have-done-better-myself\
  \ calendar (full of awesome black-and-white moody photos of haunted real-world castles\
  \ and sites), the fact that someone remembered and enjoyed that cobbled together\
  \ playtest so much was a fantastic compliment. So much so, that it's energized me\
  \ to set to work outlining Ustalav in much greater depth and prepping a new monthly\
  \ Pathfinder campaign to carry on where my fantastic playtesters left off.</p> \n\
  \   <p>So thanks to Jason R. for the incredible New Year's gift (it's totally going\
  \ on my office wall) and to everyone here on the boards who reads our stuff month\
  \ after month and keeps us going not just with subscription dollars, but with endless\
  \ support, enthusiasm, shared stories, well-considered feedback, and countless other\
  \ surprises. Thanks again everybody and I can't wait to see what you all come up\
  \ with in 2010!</p> \n   <p>F. Wesley Schneider <br>Managing Editor</p> \n  </blockquote>\
