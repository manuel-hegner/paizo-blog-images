  \  <br> Mike Brock, Paizo's new Pathfinder Society Campaign Coordinator!\n    </div>\
  \ \n    <p>With a drive the same distance as it is from Whitethrone to Eleder, I\
  \ had quite the interesting time in my four and a half days from Atlanta to Redmond.\
  \ I have been preparing my list of items I want to address with the campaign in\
  \ both structure and rules for several weeks. I was able to refine that list during\
  \ the drive. I am honored to have been chosen by Paizo as the caretaker of the Pathfinder\
  \ Society. It is an awesome, and somewhat daunting responsibility, but one I am\
  \ excited to take on.</p> \n    <p>As to how the title correlates to this blog and\
  \ my journey, it is my three Pathfinder Society Numbers. I think I bring a lot to\
  \ the Campaign Coordinator position with my prior experiences in Pathfinder Society.\
  \ I started as a player at Gen Con during the Pathfinder Special with Kyle Baird\
  \ as my GM. That experience got me hooked on Pathfinder Society, especially since\
  \ I was spared from a horrible death that first game. I continued playing and enjoying\
  \ Pathfinder Society, learning about Golarion and absorbing all the information\
  \ I could find about the campaign setting.</p> \n    <p>Several months after Gen\
  \ Con, the call went out for volunteers who were crazy enough to take on the mantle\
  \ of Venture-Captain. As I had already started a small group of Pathfinder Society\
  \ enthusiasts and knew of quite a few stores in the Atlanta area, I thought what\
  \ better way to become more active (and to have an excuse for my wife to go play)\
  \ than to be organizing Pathfinder Society. I applied, and after several emails\
  \ and a phone interview, I was offered the position. I was excited and full of enthusiasm,\
  \ ready to organize Pathfinder Society and make it the best location anywhere in\
  \ the world. After the first nine weeks of being away from home at a Pathfinder\
  \ Society game day somewhere in the metro Atlanta area, my wife helped me refocus\
  \ my goals. I quickly learned if I was going to continue to organize and grow Pathfinder\
  \ Society in my community, was going to need help. I contacted several people over\
  \ the next few months and assigned them as store liaisons. I decided if I could\
  \ have one person running Pathfinder Society at each location, they could devote\
  \ more time to that specific location, recruiting GMs and players, handling scheduling\
  \ issues and the like with store owners, and essentially taking ownership of Pathfinder\
  \ Society in their little section of Atlanta. That left me with only having to worry\
  \ about the website, making sure locations didn’t conflict with games being run,\
  \ and other coordination efforts. A special thanks goes out to Kyle and Nani Pratt\
  \ (current Atlanta co-Venture-Captains), Joseph Caubo, John Compton, and Blake Sorenesen\
  \ for their efforts as store liaisons. Without their help, Pathfinder Society in\
  \ Atlanta would have never grown to where it is today.</p> \n    <p>And now we fast-forward\
  \ to the past few months. I became aware just before Gen Con that the Campaign Coordinator\
  \ position was becoming available. I emailed Paizo with my interest, and to my surprise,\
  \ I was called in for an interview during Gen Con. But this was not just any interview.\
  \ This was a lunch interview and they were paying for my lunch! After meeting up\
  \ with several of the Decemvirate members outside the Pathfinder Society room, we\
  \ made the long walk to our dining establishment—White Castle. I have to say, it\
  \ was unlike any interview I had participated in before but it was a free lunch.\
  \ The interview went fairly well and I went back to GMing thinking that was the\
  \ last I would hear about the open position. To my surprise, several weeks later\
  \ I received a phone call from Erik Mona offering me the job. After making sure\
  \ it was okay with the wife (after all, I accepted Venture-Captain without telling\
  \ her), and that moving to the opposite side of the country was not out of the question,\
  \ I accepted.</p> \n    <p>I arrived at Paizo last Tuesday. The first few days have\
  \ been hectic. I’ve been clearing up overdue emails, catching up on how everything\
  \ works here, and presenting some of my ideas. Over the course of the next few months,\
  \ I will be presenting some of those ideas through Pathfinder Society blogs on Mondays.\
  \ Just as my store liaisons were vital to me growing Pathfinder Society in Atlanta,\
  \ the Venture-Captains are very important ambassadors to the game to help me grow\
  \ Pathfinder Society throughout the world. With my trust in them, and my commitment\
  \ to the Pathfinder Society playerbase, I am confident we will see amazing growth.\
  \ One thing I want to emphasize is that Pathfinder Society is not my campaign. It\
  \ is your campaign. I am just the caretaker. I try to listen to all of your concerns\
  \ and work with people here at Paizo to make sure the campaign improves. I am not\
  \ looking to change everything about it. I think it is fairly strong as it is. But\
  \ there are some things that can be done better.</p> \n    <p>One of the first things\
  \ I am doing is targeting more than 25 new regions I would like to assign new Venture\
  \ Captains. You can find information on how to apply and what areas we are looking\
  \ to include in the <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/about/regionalCoordinators\">Regional\
  \ Coordinators forum</a>.</p> \n    <p>Once again, I thank Paizo for entrusting\
  \ me to take care of Pathfinder Society and I thank all of you for making the campaign\
  \ what it is today.</p> \n    <p><b>A Reminder:</b> Don't miss the Pathfinder Tales\
