  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>I'm from South Australia and started\
  \ playing RPGs in 1979 with a photocopy of a photocopy of some of the Original D&amp;D\
  \ books and an incomplete set of polyhedral dice. We gradually added the AD&amp;D\
  \ books as they came out (it still amuses me to think how impatient I get when my\
  \ subscriptions are a week late given that I had to wait a whole year between releases\
  \ back then). Our group had our own little edition war on 2nd Edition's release\
  \ by the company we referred to as T$R (clever, huh?) Our indignant rage led us\
  \ to leave D&amp;D and move on to other games over the next fifteen years or soâ€”\
  predominantly Rolemaster, but also a smattering of others.</p> \n     <p>I first\
  \ became aware of Paizo early in 2008 when time pressures started to make DMing\
  \ difficult. I looked around for a 'campaign in a box' and discovered the Shackled\
  \ City compilation which I planned to convert to rolemaster. I enjoyed reading it\
  \ so much that I went looking on this new-fangled internet thing to discover that\
  \ Paizo had just completed another Adventure Path (Runelords) and were starting\
  \ a third. (I think AP#8 had just released). Due to a longstanding paranoia about\
  \ online purchases, my AP subscription (or 'gateway drug' as I think of it) didn't\
  \ begin until midway through Second Darkness. Soon afterwards, I was signed up for\
  \ everything I could get my hands on. I also started furiously backordering all\
  \ those things I'd missed before they went out of print.</p> \n     <p>Our group\
  \ now plays an eclectic mix of systems, but all my games are set in Golarion and\
  \ most of the adventures I run are Paizo APs or modules. I love the way Pathfinder\
  \ has broadened over the last few years, both in the different product lines but\
  \ also in the more recent rules supplements - many of which I use even when running\
  \ other systems. Although I've spent most of my time in the DM's chair, I do play\
  \ from time to time. My favourite characters tend to be fighters or thieves and\
  \ I've recently realised I have a disconcerting tendency towards playing conmen,\
  \ charlatans and duplicitous frauds.</p> \n     <p>The Paizo community is a significant\
  \ factor that keeps me coming back to Pathfinder. The presence the staff has on\
  \ the forums and the level of engagement of the company is well known, but the general\
  \ civility and willingness to help out with advice or clarifications from the other\
  \ fans is something I think really makes Paizo.com a special corner of the internet.\
  \ I can't think of anywhere else I'd rather ask a dumb question. It seems that,\
  \ no matter how blindingly obvious, there's always someone around to explain it\
  \ even more simply.</p> \n     <p>I have more than enough Pathfinder material to\
  \ last the rest of my life, but still look forward to every subscription shipment\
  \ just as much as I did waiting for those AD&amp;D hardcovers to make the slow journey\
  \ over from America all those years ago.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>PS: If\
