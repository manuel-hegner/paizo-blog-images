  \ #6—Closing Your Location</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, February 14, 2017</p>\
  \ \n   <p><i>Before we jump in to Shannon Appelcline's latest strategy blog, we'd\
  \ like to let you know that we're now offering promo cards from Rise of the Runelords\
  \ and Skull &amp; Shackles for sale <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/promo\"\
  >here on paizo.com</a>. These cards are not reprints—they are the very same printings\
  \ that we shipped to subscribers a couple of years ago (so the cut and color of\
  \ the RotR promos in particular is slightly different from the cards we print today).\
  \ (So, why haven't we put up promos for newer sets? Being a subscriber has its privileges!)</i></p>\
  \ \n   <p itemprop=\"description\"><i>This is the sixth installment of our strategy\
  \ blog written by game historian <a href=\"http://erzo.org/shannon/index.phtml\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Shannon Appelcline</a>. You can read all the installments <a\
  \ href=\"/paizo/blog/tags/adventureCardGameStrategy\">here</a>.</i></p> \n   <p>The\
  \ main goal for almost every <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame\">Pathfinder\
  \ Adventure Card Game</a> location is closing it. Though you may send characters\
  \ to locations due to other challenges or benefits inherent in them, closing conditions\
  \ should weigh heavily in your decisions. But there's a flip side to closing locations:\
  \ abandoning them. Sometimes you'll realize that a location just got much harder\
  \ to close, and that should make you consider moving away from it. Closing and abandoning:\
  \ they're the final yin and yang of working with locations in PACG.</p> \n   <h2>Visit\
  \ the Hard-to-Close Locations First</h2> \n   <p>It may seem counterintuitive, but\
  \ it's usually helpful to visit the hard-to-close locations first. If a character\
  \ is going to need a high roll or a blessing to close out a location, go there first.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>This is because you only want to close these locations, at whatever high\
  \ cost or low odds, <i>once</i>. And you don't want to do it when you're concentrating\
  \ on other things. If you visit a hard-to-close location first, then you should\
  \ finish with it well before you're fighting the game's final villain, so you won't\
  \ need to mess with it while you're also trying to collect together blessings to\
  \ fight the villain, and you won't need to temporarily close it multiple times if\
  \ the villain manages to escape.</p> \n   <p>(Yes, you might still face the villain\
  \ early in the game, but if so he's going to get away anyway, so temporarily closing\
  \ that hard-to-close location isn't a do-or-die requirement.)</p> \n   <h2>Save\
  \ the Impossible-to-Close Locations for Last</h2> \n   <p>If a location is nearly\
  \ impossible to close (because it doesn't correlate to the skills of your characters)\
  \ or if it's undesirable to close (because it requires you to do something like\
  \ banish a card or take damage), then follow Paul McCartney's advice: <i>Let it\
  \ be</i>.</p> \n   <p>The reason is that you are less likely to find a villain in\
  \ the early locations: at the start of a standard scenario, the odds of finding\
  \ a villain at any random location are 1/(<i>n</i>+2) where <i>n</i> is the number\
  \ of players. As you close locations, a random open location will be more likely\
  \ to contain a villain, either because that's where the villain started or because\
  \ that's where he fled to; by the time that it's possible to actually beat the villain,\
  \ the odds of the villain being at the impossible-to-close location are 1/<i>n</i>,\
  \ and the odds continue to increase as you close locations. And, if you defeat a\
  \ villain at the location in question, then you don't have to close it via the normal\
  \ means!</p> \n   <p>(Yes, you might still have to try and close that nasty, nasty\
  \ location, but you're minimizing the odds as much as possible.)</p> \n   <h2>Don't\
  \ Close Locations You Don't Want to Close</h2> \n   <p>Hold on a second, though.\
  \ Do you actually <i>want</i> to close a location? There's no choice when you beat\
  \ villains, but when you defeat a henchman you can decide whether or not you want\
  \ to try.</p> \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-JunkBeach.jpg\"\

  \ \n    <p><i>Warning: No lifeguard on duty.</i></p> \n   </div> \n   <p>There are\
  \ only a scant few situations where the answer might be <i>no</i>:</p> \n   <ul>\n\
  \    <li>You might defer closing a location if you have no chance of closing it\
  \ or if doing so might cause characters damage. For example, you might not close\
  \ Junk Beach if you're unlikely to defeat the Poison Trap, because failing would\
  \ damage you, and possibly your friends.</li> \n    <li>You might not close a location\
  \ if you <i>really</i> want a type of card or even a specific card that you spied\
  \ at that location.</li>\n   </ul> \n   <p>There are also some situations that might\
  \ strengthen your resolve not to close:</p> \n   <ul>\n    <li>If a location deck\
  \ contains just a few cards, there's less concern about finishing it off.</li> \n\
  \    <li>If you've already decided that you've lost the game, you might as well\
  \ keep the location open if there's any reason to do so.</li>\n   </ul> \n   <p>However,\
  \ the answer should almost always be <i>yes</i>: you should usually close locations\
  \ given the opportunity. Quite simply, if you choose not to close, then you've massively\
  \ increased the odds that you're going to lose this session of play. So make sure\
  \ that you understand that it's probably a trade-off versus winning the game.</p>\
  \ \n   <h2>Abandon Your Location If You Fail to Close It</h2> \n   <p>Absent some\
  \ of these reasons to stay at a location, when you beat a henchman and fail to close\
  \ the location, you should also beat feet. That's because there's no longer a way\
  \ to close the location early, which means that you're going to have to dig through\
  \ the whole deck. Unless you really want the boons there, don't bother. You'd do\
  \ better to go to another location that you might close easier, then return to the\
  \ hench-less location only (1) when you need to be stationed there to temporarily\
  \ close it to trap the villain <i>or</i> (2) after you chase the villain there,\
  \ making it possible to close the location easily once more.</p> \n   <h2>Abandon\
  \ Your Location If You Chase Away the Villain</h2> \n   <p>You should similarly\
  \ abandon a location if you fight a villain there and lose. Yes, the fleeing villain\
  \ <i>could</i> return to his original location, but unless it's the only location\
  \ that was open, he <i>might</i> have gone somewhere else instead—and if he did,\
  \ your current location just got really hard to close.</p> \n   <p>Imagine that\
  \ you have two other open locations when you lose to the villain. Each of those\
  \ other locations now has an average of 1.33 cards that can close the location:\
  \ the deck's original henchman (there's your \"1\") and the 1-in-3 chance that the\
  \ villain fled there (there's your \".33\"). However, since the villain's original\
  \ location didn't have a henchman, it now has only the possibility that the villain\
  \ fled there, so it has an average of just .33 cards that can close the location.\
  \ Obviously, that makes it less desirable, barring other factors.</p> \n   <h2>Abandon\
  \ Your Location If You Temporarily Closed It</h2> \n   <p>There's one other closure-related\
  \ reason that might lead you to abandon a location: when you temporarily closed\
  \ it during a fight against a villain, and the villain fled <i>somewhere else</i>.\
  \ Clearly you don't want to leave your temporarily closed location if you have enough\
  \ coverage to close everything down again next time you fight the villain. But if\
  \ you've still got one or two extra locations, then you'd do better to visit the\
  \ locations that weren't closed. That's because the location you temporarily closed\
  \ has just one card that can close the location: the henchman. But the <i>n</i>\
  \ locations that were open when the villain fled have a higher average: the henchman\
  \ and a 1/<i>n</i> chance of a villain.</p> \n   <p>Of course, you need to decide\
  \ if you actually <i>want</i> to encounter the villain or not, and either go to\
  \ the unclosed locations or not based on that decision.</p> \n   <p><b>Next time</b>:\
  \ Rolling your dice.</p> \n   <p>Shannon Appelcline<br> <i>Game Historian</i></p>\
