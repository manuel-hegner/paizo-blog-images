  artist: "some new equipment, weapons, and armor (some of which first appeared in\
    \ the Runelords Player's guide, but others, like the sawtooth sabre, the doctor's\
    \ mask, or the xxx, are brand new!). Several new feats are sprinkled throguhout\
    \ the PDF as well (including one that gives fans of the crossbow some badly needed\
    \ attention). The last few pages present several different background traits you\
    \ can select for your new character to give him a instant \"in\" into Curse of\
    \ the Crimson Throne's first adventure, \"Edge of Anarchy.\" Oh, and the Golarion\
    \ calendar is finally in print here as wellâ€”no more sifting back through blog\
    \ posts to find out what day of the week and what month it is! So go download\
    \ your free Player's Guide, break out the six-sided dice, and start rolling up\
    \ some stats! Korvosa's going to need all the heroes she can get before this Adventure\
    \ Path comes to its concludsion! James Jacobs Pathfinder Editor-in-Chief"
