  \ itemprop=\"description\">March sees some major changes for the <a href=\"/starfinderSociety\"\
  >Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild</a>. This month, we transition to two scenarios\
  \ per monthâ€”after all, we can't lag behind <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkff?Starfinder-Adventure-Path-News\"\
  >the adventure path line switching to one adventure per month</a>! Luckily, the\
  \ organized play team had contingencies for Starfinder's rampant success, and many\
  \ of the stories we want to tell were based on a potential two scenario per month\
  \ rollout. So, without any further rambling on my part, how about we take a peek\
  \ at the March releases?</p> \n    <p><a href=\"/products/btpy9y4l/discuss?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-110-The-HalfAlive-Streets\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society #1-10: The Half-Alive Streets</em></a> written by Mara Lynn\
  \ Butler, is our first scenario release in March. This scenario takes us back to\
  \ Absalom Station at a lower level range and provides some additional introductory\
  \ friendly content for newer Starfinder Society players. What I enjoyed most about\
  \ this scenario is that Mara Lynn included scenes that really focus on the personal\
  \ lives of some of Absalom Station's inhabitants and gives some really touching\
  \ moments for the PCs to get involved in. Also, this scenario has some callbacks\
  \ to previous scenarios, with a few fan-favorite NPCs making their return. I know\
  \ that at least one of these NPCs is obvious, but I think players will be surprised\
  \ to see a second (maybe) friendly face show up during this adventure.</p> \n  \
  \  <p>This scenario has no tags.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a\

  \ second scenario (still getting used to that) is <a href=\"/products/btpy9y4m?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-111-In-Pursuit-of-the-Scoured-Past\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society #1-11: In Pursuit of the Scoured Past</em></a> by Pathfinder\
  \ Society veteran author, Cole Kronewitter. Cole's <a href=\"/products/btpy9m00?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-7-25-Orders-from-the-Gate\"\
  >had some experience working with Hellknights</a>, and when we decided this scenario\
  \ was going to introduce some Hellknights into Starfinder Society, we knew that\
  \ he'd be an excellent fit to write it! Along with Hellknights, this scenario also\
  \ continues the ongoing narrative of the Year of Scoured Stars, and it acts as the\
  \ second installment in our ongoing major story arc that started with <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9wet?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-105-The-First-Mandate\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society #1-05: The First Mandate</em></a>. Finally, this scenario\
  \ introduces a new locale that I really think encapsulates the theme of Science-Fantasy:\
  \ the library world of Athaeum. I suspect scholarly PCs (and a certain scholarly\
  \ ysoki who tags along with them) will find themselves overwhelmed by the specific\
  \ information kept within the towers of this mysterious world.</p> \n    <p>This\
  \ scenario has the Faction (Second Seekers [Luwazi Elsebo]) tag and contributes\
  \ to the ongoing year of the Scoured Stars storyline.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ></a> \n     <p><i>Illustration by Priscilla Kim</i></p>\n    </div> \n    <p>Next\
  \ month is looking to provide a similar spread of scenario types. First off, we\
  \ have a new repeatable introductory scenario that includes starship combat. Next\
  \ month's other release is the third part in the ongoing Scoured Stars storyline\
  \ that also includes a very special starship encounter. Expect to see a preview\
  \ post on these scenarios sometime in April. Next week, get ready to hear about\
  \ our future plans for the Starfinder Society, when we unveil our Origins offerings\
  \ and provide some further information on our first interactive special.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Now, it's time for me to get back to work and work on some of our future\
  \ scenarios!</p> \n    <p>Thurston Hillman<br> <i>Starfinder Society Developer</i></p>\
