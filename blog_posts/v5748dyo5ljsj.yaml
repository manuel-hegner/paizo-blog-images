  >Gears of Faith</a>, <i>Keren is a sworn knight of Iomedae, proper and disciplined\
  \ in every way. Her partner, Zae, is the opposite—a curious gnome priestess of the\
  \ clockwork goddess, who loves nothing more than the chaos of her makeshift hospitals.\
  \ When a powerful evil artifact is stolen from a crusader stronghold, both knight\
  \ and gnome are sent to the great city of Absalom and immediately drawn into the\
  \ clandestine search for the stolen Bloodstone. Sure, they may not be the most powerful\
  \ or experienced members of their organizations, but that's the whole point—with\
  \ legendary champions and undead graveknights battling in their race to recover\
  \ the stone, who'll notice one young knight and a gnome healer? All they have to\
  \ do is stay alive long enough to outsmart a thief capable of evading both gods\
  \ and heroes. No big deal, right?</i></p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <h2>Chapter\
  \ 2: Welcoming Committee</h2> \n     <p>Veena Heliu, the Precentor Martial for Magic,\
  \ was often described as fiery for reasons that had nothing to do with her red hair.\
  \ She was deep in an argument when they arrived, her raised voice audible from the\
  \ other end of a long marble hallway. Pages wearing indoor boots of soft leather\
  \ shuffled past silently, carrying scrolls in secure tubes and not making eye contact\
  \ with Zae or each other. Keren, by contrast, had the conspicuous jingle and clank\
  \ of armor to accompany her every step.</p> \n     <p>Zae couldn't distinguish Veena's\
  \ distant words through their echoes, and she was almost disappointed when the yelling\
  \ cut off abruptly upon their approach, replaced with the sibilant hisses of angry\
  \ whispers. From the set of Keren's jaw, this wasn't normal; Zae surmised that whatever\
  \ the source of the buzz Keren had mentioned, it had not been resolved overnight.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Zae had never been inside Vigil's Crusader War College, but Keren's\
  \ father had taught here, and his children had grown up within Castle Overwatch's\
  \ walls. Zae and Appleslayer followed as Keren led the way with the familiarity\
  \ of muscle memory rather than recent experience. She tried a couple times to make\
  \ conversation, but Keren's face was drawn tight and Zae left her to her own thoughts.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Keren Rhinn! Right on time.\" Most people towered over Zae—she was\
  \ used to that—but she suspected Veena Heliu could tower over people even taller\
  \ than the sorcerer herself. She radiated such power and certainty that the air\
  \ was alive with it. Zae looked around, but saw no one else; whomever Veena had\
  \ been arguing with had left, if they'd ever been physically present at all.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Reporting as summoned,\" Keren answered, stopping sharply at a respectful\
  \ distance. Veena was a half-elf, and though she was not Keren's true aunt, Keren\
  \ had referred to her as \"Auntie Veena\" on the walk over. There was no sign of\
  \ that informality on Keren's part now. \"This is Sister Zae, Cleric of Brigh.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>The precentor nodded curtly toward Zae, then surveyed Appleslayer,\
  \ who stood alert at attention in his polished saddle. \"And this is your mount,\
  \ ready for his combat training.\" More often than not, the people Zae encountered\
  \ were surprised to see dogs in such a role, but Heliu's life revolved around the\
  \ art of war and the duty of defense. Her lack of surprise was no surprise. A note\
  \ of approval hung in her voice, which might or might not have been Zae's hopeful\
  \ imagination.</p> \n     <p>Appleslayer's plumed tail twitched back and forth once\
  \ in a single low, uncertain wag.</p> \n     <p>Heliu held out her hands, one toward\
  \ each of them. \"Are you ready?\"</p> \n     <p>Keren hesitated.</p> \n     <p>\"\
  Speak freely, Crusader.\"</p> \n     <p>Keren cleared her throat. \"Excuse me, ma'am,\
  \ but I'd requested</p> \n     <p>to be briefed on the reason for the fast transport.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"I didn't receive orders to brief you. I'm afraid your request's</p>\
  \ \n     <p>been denied from higher up.\"</p> \n     <p>Zae looked between the two\
  \ women. Keren always accepted</p> \n     <p>command decisions, even when they left\
  \ her conflicted—and Zae knew when she was conflicted, because the bottled-in frustration\
  \ came out in the safety of their home—but Zae had also seen Keren's can't we work\
  \ around this? face enough to recognize it now.</p> \n     <p>\"Well, thank you\
  \ all the same,\" Zae said to defuse the silence. \"I would be excited to spend\
  \ weeks on a boat, but I'm sure Keren's glad to be getting to where we're going.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"Quite so,\" Heliu answered. \"I'll be taking you into a private\
  \ park. It's discreet, unchanging, and no one pays much attention to how many people\
  \ are wandering around there. I must return immediately to my duties, so I won't\
  \ be able to direct you to the Seventh Church myself, but someone from the church\
  \ will be there to meet us.\"</p> \n     <p>They both took Heliu's offered hands,\
  \ and Zae and Keren each buried their free hands in Appleslayer's fur. The sensation\
  \ was slight—just an odd weightlessness in Zae's stomach—and then it was over. Her\
  \ feet were now on grass. Whereas they had left at noon, they arrived in a place\
  \ where the sun was noticeably lower in the afternoon sky. A copse of trees at the\
  \ edge of the park made an almost accidental clearing that would be difficult to\
  \ stumble upon by chance. In different circumstances, it would have been a perfect\
  \ spot for a moonlit tryst.</p> \n     <p>Zae checked herself and her companions.\
  \ No limbs seemed to be out of place. Veena had already disappeared again. Appleslayer\
  \ whuffed softly under his breath, and Zae shook her head. \"No exploring for now.\
  \ Stay close.\"</p> \n     <p>When they stepped around the corner and into the larger\
  \ park, they found an expanse of lush green meadow dotted with people lounging in\
  \ twos and threes. In front of them, sitting on a stone bench with a small leather-bound\
  \ book in her hands, was a woman dressed in the robes of Iomedae.</p> \n     <p>\"\
  I leave you to it.\" Veena nodded toward the initiate, and exchanged quiet words\
  \ with Keren. Zae was too distracted studying her surroundings to pay attention.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The priestess stood and tucked the book away into the folds of her robes\
  \ as Zae and her companions approached, greeting them with a warm smile. Roughly\
  \ the same age as Darrin's aunt Strella, she had straight honey-brown hair and a\
  \ particular intensity Zae had often seen in people who were strongly devoted to\
  \ their gods. \"Welcome,\" the woman said to them, gaze lingering on the white and\
  \ gold of Keren's armor. \"You must be our new arrivals from Lastwall.\"</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"That we are.\" Keren held up her left palm in greeting,</p> \n     <p>displaying\
  \ the sword-mark there. Zae and Keren both bore the shield on their right palms.\
  \ While Zae had her odd gear-shaped birthmark on her left hand, Keren had received\
  \ the sword-mark of Iomedae on that palm to identify her as a Vigilant defender\
  \ of Lastwall. \"Crusader Keren Rhinn, and this is Sister Zae. Thank you for meeting\
  \ us. We're pleased to be in Absalom.\"</p> \n     <p>\"My name is Kala, initiate\
  \ of Iomedae. It's a pleasure to be of service to the Knights of Ozem, especially\
  \ in these trying times. Shall we?\" Kala gestured to the path.</p> \n     <p>They\
  \ walked along a quiet wooded trail at an unrushed pace that surprised Zae, considering\
  \ how hasty their departure from Vigil had been once all the gears were in motion.\
  \ Kala addressed Keren while Zae and Appleslayer followed behind. Keren stole a\
  \ look over her shoulder, eyebrows drawn in momentary concern, but Zae smiled assuringly\
  \ in response. She didn't feel slighted. If her organization had greeted them, Zae\
  \ would have expected the attention to be hers, but it was a pleasant day, with\
  \ a breeze stirring the tops of the trees, and she was content to walk with her\
  \ dog, enjoy the weather, and muse about what studying at the Clockwork Cathedral\
  \ would be like.</p> \n     <p>\"What's the name of this place?\" Keren asked.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Oh! I should be a better guide. I'm sorry. It's always so exciting\
  \ to meet new people. This is the... well, Greenery Park. We'll be heading west\
  \ into the center of Absalom from here. It's the best route at this time of day.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>Her hesitation sounded like embarrassment, so Zae said, \"City planners\
  \ are strange creatures. Seems like a redundant</p> \n     <p>name for a park, doesn't\
  \ it? Does the temple have you on guide duty often?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Oh, not often.\
  \ Well, not until recently. All these servants of Iomedae flocking into the city.\
  \ I do quite enjoy meeting new members of the order. Not new new, I mean, intending\
  \ no offense to your possibly extensive and decorated service, but new to me.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>They followed a wide carriage road out of the park and entered the\
  \ bustle of a city headed toward evening. \"You mentioned these trying times?\"\
  \ Keren asked.</p> \n     <p>\"Are those camels?\" Zae blurted at the same time.\
  \ While there were a few horses and donkeys to be seen, camels seemed to be the\
  \ customary beast of burden and transport here. Zae had never seen a camel in person\
  \ before, and something about them struck her oddly. Maybe it was the spindlyness\
  \ of their legs, or the long, questing necks, but they just didn't look like they'd\
  \ been assembled according to an optimal design. Appleslayer stopped in the middle\
  \ of the road, sniffing the air, and took a few steps toward a narrow side street,\
  \ whining under his breath.</p> \n     <p>Zae followed him and peered down the street.\
  \ She saw an aged pub sign creaking over a narrow doorway, and a shadowed dead end\
  \ piled with rubbish beyond. She snapped her fingers by her thigh. \"Come on, Apple.\
  \ I know the camels stink, but I need you to stay close.\"</p> \n     <p>The dog\
  \ whined once more, grumbled under his breath, and trotted back to Zae's side. She\
  \ rubbed between his ears. \"Good boy. I know it's all really interesting, but we\
  \ need to keep up with Keren.\"</p> \n     <p>When Zae returned with Appleslayer\
  \ at her side, Kala was still describing the various troubles the city was facing.\
  \ Keren, who had never lived in any city but Vigil, listened patiently while the\
  \ initiate rambled. Zae, who had spent time in several cities, knew the issues to\
  \ be mostly generic. Sewers not keeping up with rising population; crime in the\
  \ poorer districts; too much distrust of certain officials and too much trust of\
  \ others. Meanwhile, there was no mistaking their passage across some invisible\
  \ border into the next district to the west—buildings were suddenly closer together\
  \ and more people crowded the streets, all with different destinations. A knot of\
  \ chaos resulted, which for Zae manifested as a sea of knees and thighs. She noticed\
  \ armor, leather and metal; women in soft breeches or simple dresses with minimal\
  \ ornamentation; and very few shoes that had seen a brush or cloth in recent memory.\
  \ These were commoners by and large, with a few servants shopping for their masters,\
  \ and a few lawkeepers maintaining order or soldiers doing their own errands. She\
  \ hopped up into Appleslayer's saddle and then, while stopped at a corner, stood\
  \ atop it with Keren's arm for balance, at last catching a glimpse of the peaks\
  \ of market stall tents.</p> \n     <p>\"What's this place?\" Zae asked.</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"Ah, this? This is the Gold District.\"</p> \n     <p>A passing servant\
  \ with a broad basket at her hip bumped into</p> \n     <p>Kala and looked at her\
  \ askance. \"It's the Coins, actually,\" she said, and then moved on.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>Kala cleared her throat, ignoring the imposition, but Zae exchanged a glance\
  \ with Keren. A translation error, perhaps, though Kala didn't have any particular\
  \ foreign accent that Zae could place. \"Whatever you call it, it's the trade quarter,\
  \ if you will. Anything can be bought and sold here, at any time of day or night.\
  \ Is there something like it where you come from? Lastwall, wasn't it? They never\
  \ tell me anything about the arrivals, just when to be at the meeting point.\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The constant questions were having an effect on Keren's bearing, though\
  \ Zae knew no one else would have noticed the shift in her armored shoulders. \"\
  Have you always studied here in Absalom?\" she asked, redirecting the initiate.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Oh, I've only arrived recently, myself. It's the home of so many miracles,\
  \ you know. Legendary for its concentration of relics, too.</p> \n     <p>I've heard\
  \ that practically everything of religious significance probably finds its way here\
  \ eventually. Have you heard that?\"</p> \n     <p>\"I hadn't, actually.\"</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"Well, apparently it's true. The Pathfinder Society has its headquarters\
  \ here, and securing relics is one of the many things it does. And there are so\
  \ many museums! Both public and private collections. This truly is where antiquities\
  \ are traded and where history lives.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Speaking of living history,\
  \ are you taking us directly to the church, or to our lodgings first?\" Keren asked.\
  \ The row houses here weren't exactly crumbling, but they looked like drunken old\
  \ men in the small hours, propping each other up as they stumbled home from a tavern.\
  \ It would be interesting to stay in one of them, Zae thought. She imagined them\
  \ smelling of booze on the inside and swaying slightly around last call.</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"Oh, to your lodgings of course, so that you can freshen up before you\
  \ present yourselves to the church. You'll be staying just west of here, in the\
  \ Foreign Quarter, where most of the city's guest housing is. I brought you this\
  \ way because it's just so important to know where the markets are in a new city,\
  \ don't you think?\" Kala returned her attention to Keren. \"Everything can be bought\
  \ and sold in the Coins.\"</p> \n     <p>Keren nodded. \"As you said. It's very\
  \ good to know; you have our thanks.\"</p> \n     <p>Kala pressed her point. \"\
  Everything.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Indeed, Sister.\"</p> \n     <p>\"So, if you were\
  \ searching for someone who'd stolen something,</p> \n     <p>perhaps to sell it,\
  \ this might be where you would look. Wouldn't you say?\"</p> \n     <p>Zae knew\
  \ the expression that now crossed Keren's face. For a moment, she wore the same\
  \ one. \"I daresay you know the city far better than we, Sister.\" Keren was only\
  \ that formal when she was choosing her words carefully. \"Surely a city this large\
  \ has many crevices for people who don't want to be found.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Yes,\
  \ surely. But where are they sending you to look?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Look for what?\"\
  \ Zae asked, nudging Apple to keep up. Kala didn't spare her a glance.</p> \n  \
  \   <p>\"It's all right.\" Their guide shifted closer to Keren. \"I know why you're\
  \ really here. I so desperately want to help, but I'm a new initiate so they've\
  \ got me just escorting the seasoned ones in. I don't get to see any adventure for\
  \ myself. Take a little pity on me and let me live vicariously through your mission.\
  \ The other groups have all told me where they're being sent...\"</p> \n     <p>\"\
  I didn't think it was exactly secret,\" Keren said, and Kala's posture straightened\
  \ expectantly. \"My mission is to train at the Tempering Hall. I'll be deepening\
  \ my understanding of my faith, studying the Acts of Iomedae, and—\"</p> \n    \
  \ <p>Kala waved her graceful hand. \"There's no need for such pretense.\"</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"Pretense?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Your cover story is practiced to perfection.\
  \ It's completely believable. But I mean your actual mission, of course. The...\
  \ artifact. You know.\"</p> \n     <p>\"I'm sure I don't,\" Keren said. \"Perhaps\
  \ you've confused us with another traveling party.\"</p> \n     <p>Kala smiled a\
  \ smile that was just on the forced side of amusement. \"Anyway, it doesn't matter.\
  \ Tell me, in—Lastwall, did you say?—is torture a part of your training?\"</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"The giving or the enduring?\" Keren answered, her voice just a notch\
  \ too tight to be joking. Kala tossed her head back and laughed.</p> \n     <p>\"\
  Oh, you're lovely. The enduring, of course.\"</p> \n     <p>Keren stiffened again,\
  \ and Appleslayer's muscles tensed as if he'd caught wind of an unpleasant smell.\
  \ He knew how to read Keren's body language as well as Zae herself did, or perhaps\
  \ an actual scent signaled her wariness to the dog's sensitive nose.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>\"Yes, yes, you're very loyal. I can see why they chose you.\" Kala turned\
  \ a corner, leading them down a narrow alley that ended at a crumbling wall. \"\
  But unfortunately, that loyalty means you're of little use to me. I've given you\
  \ plenty of chances to answer me freely, but those answers will be carved out of\
  \ you if need be. No one can hold out against torture forever.\" Four shadows dropped\
  \ from the low roofs on either side of the alley. \"This is your last chance.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>Zae blinked. At times like this, when the course of events took a\
  \ turn she wasn't expecting, she felt like a clock that had just started to run\
  \ down and would be fine again after a bit of winding. While it was a relief to\
  \ see that, once again, Appleslayer's wary instincts had been correct, Zae felt\
  \ strangely betrayed. There had been something endearing about the guide who didn't\
  \ know the city.</p> \n     <p>Three men and a woman in leather armor and shrouding\
  \ hoods converged on them, weapons drawn. Rather, they converged on Keren—she had\
  \ the big sword, and had held Kala's attention. Zae and Appleslayer hadn't registered\
  \ as a threat. This was something Zae could use to her advantage; she retreated\
  \ a few steps and dropped her hand to her side, palm back, signaling for Appleslayer\
  \ to wait. She called upon Brigh to bless her allies, and saw courage surge through\
  \ Keren and the dog.</p> \n     <p>Keren drew her long, straight-bladed sword up\
  \ into a parry, deflecting an attacker's sword with a clang of angry metal. \"I\
  \ don't know what you think I have, but I swear to you I don't have it. We're just\
  \ here to train.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Unlikely,\" Kala said, drawing a sword from the\
  \ folds of her robe. \"We've been waiting for the Knights of Ozem to get involved.\
  \ How convenient that they always arrive at the same place. So. Lead us to the artifact\
  \ and we'll spare you. Defy us and we'll kill you both, and the next knights they\
  \ send after you, and the next.\"</p> \n     <p>Zae curled her hand into a fist;\
  \ Apple, recognizing the wordless command, sprang forth with teeth bared.</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"Tezryn—behind you!\" one of the attackers shouted, and the robed woman\
  \ turned. She slashed at Appleslayer with her sword, but the dog sprang out of range.\
  \ He circled and made a lunge for Kala's calf. The dog had enough bulk to throw\
  \ an unprepared opponent off balance and enough herding instinct to shuttle enemies\
  \ toward Keren's blade, but Kala sidestepped, raising her sword to parry Keren's\
  \ attack. No matter how many times Apple engaged in combat, Zae was always fascinated\
  \ to see him employ the same leaping and bounding maneuvers that were trademarks\
  \ of his breed's energetic play.</p> \n     <p>Zae ticked over the spells she had\
  \ prepared that morning, without having known she would be teleported to Absalom\
  \ or dropped into the middle of an alley brawl. She now knew several things about\
  \ their guide: not only was she not a cleric of Iomedae, but if her first instinct\
  \ was to strike out with a blade rather than a spell, then she likely wasn't an\
  \ aspiring priestess of any god at all. Meanwhile, something odd was tickling at\
  \ her senses, something about the way the rest of them moved that wasn't quite right.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Kala—no, Tezryn—dodged Keren's next attack, but that put her right in\
  \ the path of Appleslayer's teeth. He latched onto her hamstring, jerking his head\
  \ from side to side. Keren neatly sliced the back of Tezryn's other leg, bringing\
  \ her down, then turned her attention to the closest attacker, matching him swing\
  \ for swing.</p> \n     <p>Appleslayer released his prey and turned toward one of\
  \ the other shadowy figures, a fury of sharp teeth and strong paws, nimbly ducking\
  \ swords and unarmed swipes. He would come in from behind to keep an enemy turning\
  \ and distracted, and then Keren would take the foe down with one fierce swing.\
  \ He and Keren fought as one, seamlessly aiding each other with each foe. While\
  \ Apple's emotional devotion was to Zae, he was equally loyal to Keren. She had\
  \ trained him well, and their rapport was a beautiful, fluid dance that just happened\
  \ to result in a certain amount of blood.</p> \n     <p>But this time, it didn't.\
  \ Keren sliced a man's arm clean off, and it fell twitching without the trademark\
  \ arterial gush. Zae cursed herself for not realizing it sooner, and called upon\
  \ Brigh to bring down her holy wrath upon the attackers. The maimed man fell, and\
  \ the others cringed and staggered at the sudden assault of light. Though remarkably\
  \ whole, they were not alive. And neither was their leader. She had struggled to\
  \ her knees at the periphery of the fight, but she cried out and curled herself\
  \ into a tight ball under the assault of power.</p> \n     <p>Appleslayer and Keren\
  \ tore through the attackers one by one. Their blows rang against Keren's shield.\
  \ When all of them were on the ground, Zae finished them with another surge of holy\
  \ power. The initiate, however, had worked her way to her feet somehow, and was\
  \ stumbling toward the mouth of the alley. In a fluid movement, Keren freed her\
  \ shield from her arm and threw it like a skipping stone. It scuttled across the\
  \ cobbled street and cut Tezryn's wounded legs out from under her, sending her sprawling.\
  \ When Keren pushed the leader onto her back, she was glassy-eyed but snarling.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Keren reversed her grip and held her sword over Tezryn's throat, two-handed.\
  \ \"What do you want from us? Tell me!\" Her hands were steady and the swordpoint\
  \ didn't waver, but Zae knew her well enough to hear the hurt in her voice.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>When the mock-initiate only grinned at her with bloody teeth, Keren\
  \ brought the blade down with such force that it struck all the way through the\
  \ woman's throat and impacted the pavement beneath. Tezryn gurgled, and was still.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Zae started to call Appleslayer back to her, but the dog was approaching\
  \ Keren, so she held her tongue. He sniffed at the knight, tail low, pacing around\
  \ her like an anxious child while she checked the other attackers to make sure they'd\
  \ been put down for good. Now that they were still, peeking into their hoods showed\
  \ skin stretched tight over starved cheeks, and the teeth within their parted mouths\
  \ were longer than they should have been.</p> \n     <p>Tezryn was dead without\
  \ a doubt, but that didn't put Zae at ease. She pressed her fingers to the guide's\
  \ forehead, then brought them to her own nose. The scent was faint, but it held\
  \ notes of rosemary and clean linen. \"Undead, and disguising it,\" Zae said. \"\
  Unguent of revivification, I think. And she's definitely not Iomedae's priestess.\
  \ She concealed both her appearance and her aura.\" Beneath the vestments, she wore\
  \ the same leather armor as the others.</p> \n     <p>\"Are you sure she wasn't\
  \ just alive and evil?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Positive. I called Brigh's light down upon\
  \ the undead, not the living.\"</p> \n     <p>\"So the others... ?\"</p> \n    \
  \ <p>\"Probably not under her thrall, but likely she told them where to go for a\
  \ good feast. None of them bit you, did they?\"</p> \n     <p>Keren shook her head.\
  \ \"Apple bit one of them, though. Should we be worried about that?\"</p> \n   \
  \  <p>\"I don't know. I don't think so, but better to be safe than dog food.\" Zae\
  \ motioned the dog over to her and extended a hand. Apple sniffed cautiously at\
  \ her fingers. They still smelled of the ointment, Zae realized. She wiped her hand\
  \ on her coat and gave him her other hand instead, whispering to Brigh and sharing\
  \ a soft, warming light from her fingertips through Apple's fur, concentrating on\
  \ following the warmth all the way through him. She encountered none of the sorts\
  \ of obstacles that would indicate disease or corruption. \"He's fine.\"</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"Which means that our real welcoming party...\" Keren and Zae exchanged\
  \ a long look.</p> \n     <p>Zae mounted up on Appleslayer's saddle while Keren\
  \ took the vestments of Iomedae from Tezryn's corpse and re-shouldered their supplies.\
  \ \"Apple, that alley you were curious about. Can you lead us back there? Good dog!\"\
  </p> \n     <p>As they hurried away, Zae took a quick glance back over her shoulder.\
  \ Figures were already emerging from the shadows and creeping toward the corpses.\
  \ Zae had seen squatters and street gangs scavenge what they could from the dead\
  \ in the seedier quarters of other cities. It felt a little strange to her, knowing\
  \ that it was happening, but it worked in her favor; there would likely be little\
  \ left for the attackers' masters to find.</p> \n     <p>In the alley with the pub\
  \ sign, Apple's nose led them through a heap of rubbish to the dead end and a broken,\
  \ upturned crate, underneath which was bundle of bloodied rags that had once been\
  \ fine cloth; it must have been the actual Kala's underdress. Keren cursed and turned\
  \ away, but Apple stayed by Zae's side while she peeled back the stiffening fabric.\
  \ There was little flesh to be found. Small scavengers hovered, drawn by the blood\
  \ and determined to find a scrap to eat.</p> \n     <p>\"Get, you!\" she heard Keren\
  \ shout, followed by a scattering of refuse and a scuffle of many tiny feet. Half\
  \ a dozen rats scampered out of range of Keren's sword, but didn't flee from sight,\
  \ unwilling to give up the chance of a meal. Keren crouched over the cloth, her\
  \ expression set and cold.</p> \n     <p>Zae gave her a moment, then asked, \"What\
  \ do you think they wanted so badly that they'd kill a priestess just to ask us\
  \ questions?\" \"I don't know,\" Keren said grimly. \"But we're going to find out.\"\
