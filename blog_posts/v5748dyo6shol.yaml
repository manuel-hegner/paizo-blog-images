  >Ehu Hadif paced back and forth in the Cortex server room, his anxious footsteps\
  \ beating a staccato rhythm against the tiles. Two of the kasatha’s hands were clasped\
  \ behind his back, while the other two fiddled with his comm unit and datapad, restlessly\
  \ checking his feeds for incoming messages.</p> \n       <p>Being inside the Archive’\
  s Cortex always made Ehu feel out of place, as though he had walked into a temple\
  \ of a god he did not worship. The constant hum of the towering servers and the\
  \ flicker of electronic lights were strange to him. He understood exploration, space\
  \ travel, and setting boots into dirt on new worlds—not the endless stream of digitized\
  \ data, encrypted in unfathomable numbers and code, that filled this hall. But Guidance,\
  \ the amalgamation of his deceased predecessors’ personalities, had requested a\
  \ meeting with him here. So, here he was.</p> \n       <p>For nearly a year now,\
  \ Ehu had served proudly as First Seeker of the Starfinder Society. He took this\
  \ responsibility seriously. The late nights spent under a mountain of paperwork,\
  \ early mornings waking on a cold crew quarters bunk, the distant smiles of Starfinders\
  \ he once considered close friends—all those discomforts were worth enduring in\
  \ exchange for the privilege of leading the Society. Despite the tide of fears and\
  \ worries that constantly ebbed in Ehu’s mind, his initial year as First Seeker\
  \ had been a success. He believed that. Under him, the Society had explored the\
  \ far reaches of space, forging new alliances in the Veskarium and the Vast. Agents\
  \ had also revisited familiar worlds, including Athaeum and Tabrid Minor. His work\
  \ as First Seeker was far from done, but he was pleased with the direction he was\
  \ steering the Society in.</p> \n       <p>And yet, the words he spoke at his confirmation\
  \ echoed cruelly in his mind. <em>We now enter a time of peace</em>. That’s what\
  \ he had believed. Now, Ehu scrolled through his comms history, and each message\
  \ was a cold knife in his heart. <em>Drift beacons still dark. Colonists all dead\
  \ or abducted. Fleet sustained heavy casualties. Zigvigix missing in action</em>.</p>\
  \ \n       <p>“Thank you for attending us so quickly, Ehu.” The synthetic voice\
  \ of Guidance startled the First Seeker out of his thoughts. Ehu swiped the screen\
  \ to clear his message notifications and looked up. A green holographic projection\
  \ of a lashunta of indeterminate gender stood before him.</p> \n       <p>“Is this\
  \ about the mission to Siygess-4?” he asked. <em>The failed mission</em>, he thought,\
  \ though he kept this assessment to himself.</p> \n       <p>“Yes,” Guidance answered.\
  \ “I have more information about the missing colonists to share with you. It seems\
  \ that the technological anomalies detected at their arrival locations are increasing.\
  \ Other Pact Worlds have ceased responding to our long-range comms, and we—”</p>\
  \ \n       <p>An insistent beeping cut Guidance short. The hologram flickered and\
  \ shifted to a nebulous humanoid form.</p> \n       <p>“Guidance? Is everything\
  \ alright?” Ehu asked.</p> \n       <p>“Unauthorized users detected,” a computerized\
  \ voice that differed from Guidance’s boomed throughout the server room.</p> \n\
  \       <p>“We need more information,” Guidance responded.</p> \n       <p>“Attempts\
  \ to access system failed. Recommending emergency protection mode,” the unfamiliar\
  \ voice said.</p> \n       <p>Ehu couldn’t perceive anything about this new speaker\
  \ except for its voice—was it the server itself, or some kind of AI other than Guidance\
  \ that he didn’t know about? Celita would know, but she wasn’t around to ask at\
  \ the moment. He was alone in exactly the type of situation he didn’t feel capable\
  \ of dealing with.</p> \n       <p>“Guidance?” he asked nervously.</p> \n      \
  \ <p>After a pause, Guidance spoke again.</p> \n       <p>“We are shutting down\
  \ to protect our source code and the Archive’s data. I regret that there is no time\
  \ to explain,” Guidance announced. </p> \n       <p>This was all so sudden. What\
  \ was going on? Ehu opened his mouth to protest, but Guidance continued before he\
  \ could voice his confusion.</p> \n       <p>“I do not know when it will be safe\
  \ to come back online. Until then, we leave the Society in your hands, Ehu. Protect\
  \ it.” Guidance flickered again, and the projection vanished before Ehu could react.</p>\
  \ \n       <p>Ehu touched the screen of his comm unit to check for more incoming\
  \ messages, hoping something he saw there would explain the guiding intelligence’\
  s unusual behavior. Instead of his comm logs, a notification flashed across the\
  \ screen: <em>no signal</em>.</p> \n       <p>“What?” Ehu grumbled. He was right\
  \ next to the Cortex’s servers. This room had the best connectivity in the entire\
  \ Lorespire Complex. How could he have no signal in here? Had Guidance affected\
  \ something in the network when it shut down?</p> \n       <p>The overhead lights\
  \ flickered and went out as the server room lost power. Ehu knew a backup generator\
  \ would kick on in a few minutes—unless Guidance had disabled that, too. Cursing,\
  \ he groped through the wall of solid black in front of him, wishing for the blinking\
  \ lights of this room’s resident servers to return. Ehu stumbled down the hall as\
  \ the sound of gunfire exploded from somewhere within the complex. Panicked cries\
  \ and frantic footsteps echoed in the darkness all around him. It was impossible\
  \ to tell if these noises came from outside the building or down the next corridor.</p>\
  \ \n       <p>Dim red emergency lights blazed into view along the corridor, illuminating\
  \ a path. Ehu broke into a jog and ran toward the distant sounds of combat that\
  \ were steadily increasing in volume. Ehu was a warrior out of necessity rather\
  \ than by choice; he preferred exploration to fighting, though he could handle himself.\
  \ Yet now someone—or something—threatened the Lorespire Complex, and his Society.\
  \ As First Seeker, he would do whatever he had to do to keep them safe. He would\
  \ fight alongside them.</p> \n       <p>The sliding exit portal at the end of the\
  \ hall was stuck. He pushed through the heavy doors with a grunt and stepped into\
  \ the artificial twilight outside. Chaos unfolded before him. A group of veteran\
  \ Starfinders battled black machines with strange silver runes glowing on their\
  \ chassis. Ships dipped and arced drunkenly in the sky overhead, and in the distance,\
  \ the retractable dome that protected the Station’s Eye stuttered and shook as it\
  \ struggled to descend.</p> \n       <p>“Requesting assistance!” a familiar voice\
  \ shouted. It was Celita. She crouched in a defensive position, firing into a group\
  \ of the hostile robots. The rig strapped to her wrist blinked intermittently as\
  \ she yelled into her nonfunctioning comms. Her target’s torso exploded into a fine\
  \ mist of metal shards as her bullets found their mark, but the other bots kept\
  \ barreling toward her. They would overwhelm her at any moment.</p> \n       <p>Ehu\
  \ called upon his solar mote and charged, feeling the protective solar energy blaze\
  \ around him. “I’ve got your back!” he called to Celita. Whatever force was targeting\
  \ the Society, the First Seeker would stand by his agents as they faced down their\
  \ enemy, together.</p> \n      </blockquote> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
