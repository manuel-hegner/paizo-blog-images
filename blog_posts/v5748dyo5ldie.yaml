  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>This week, Paizo publisher Erik Mona (that's\
  \ me in the picture!) and Sales Director Pierce Watters are in New York City for\
  \ Book Expo America, an annual conference of booksellers, librarians, publishers,\
  \ and book distributors that's one of the largest conventions in North America.\
  \ We've been attending Book Expo for about five years, and in that time it's been\
  \ amazing to see how the profile of our favorite roleplaying game has changed.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Back when we launched, we had to really explain Pathfinder to just about\
  \ everyone who approached our booth. To make matters a bit more complex, we're in\
  \ the \"Diamond Alley\" of Diamond Book Distributors, our book trade distribution\
  \ partner, who mostly distributes comics and graphic novels. With a booth next to\
  \ the likes of IDW, Image, and Oni Press, most folks coming to our booth wanted\
  \ to know about our comics and trade paperbacks. </p> \n    <p>These days, things\
  \ have changed considerably. Not only is Pathfinder well known to book distributors\
  \ and librarians as a highly successful and very popular tabletop roleplaying game,\
  \ but many of them come up to tell us about their Pathfinder RPG campaigns! Oh,\
  \ what a difference a half-decade makes, as they say (they do say that, right?).</p>\
  \ \n    <p>This year we've got some absolutely wonderful treats for Pathfinder fans\
  \ at the show, including early looks at actual printed samples of HUGE summer releases\
  \ like the <a href=\"/products/btpy8mqq\">Rise of the Runelords Anniversary Edition</a>,\
  \ the <a href=\"/products/btpy8qab\">Pathfinder RPG Bestiary Box</a>, the <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8qz0\">Player Character Folio</a>, every single page of the first\
  \ issue of the <a href=\"/paizo/news/v5748eaic9pak\">upcoming Pathfinder comic book\
  \ from Dynamite</a>, and more! </p> \n    <p>If you're one of the lucky folks attending\
  \ the show this year, please swing by the booth to say hi and check out the cool\
  \ new products! (In the likely event that you are NOT at Book Expo America, don't\
  \ despair, we'll have all this stuff at <a href=\"/paizocon\">PaizoCon</a> and <a\
  \ href=\"http://gencon.com\" target=\"_blank\">Gen Con</a> as well (where you will\
  \ even get to buy most of itâ€”there are no book sales at BEA, which is first and\
  \ foremost an industry trade show).</p> \n    <p>But even though most of you can't\
  \ make it to Book Expo, I wanted to drop by the Paizo Blog today with some sweet\
  \ pictures of some of the most exciting products we're showing off at this year's\
  \ show.</p> \n    <p>And I don't mean books, or comics, or even little plastic figurines.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>I'm talking about <a href=\"/products/btpy8t2m\">GOBLIN PLUSH</a>, BABY!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Say hello to my little friends:</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/20120606-Goblin2.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/20120606-Goblin2_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>That's right, later this year these cute\
  \ little monsters will be making their way to the marketplace! They stand 10 inches\
  \ tall, and while soft and adorable, they're rigid enough to stand on your game\
  \ shelves or on guard over your bed, protecting your dreams from evil dogs and horses.\
  \ We've got three goblins in production right now. The ones in the background are\
  \ prototypes, and will change a bit before production, but I wanted to at least\
  \ hint at the variety in store. </p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a\
  \ href=\"/image/content/Blog/20120606-Goblin.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/20120606-Goblin_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>This guy looks exactly like he will when\
  \ he ships later this year, complete with his eerie smile, earring, arm band, belt,\
  \ and shorts. The other two goblins (with slight variations to their facial expressions)\
  \ will follow shortly thereafter, with the plan being to release all three varieties\
  \ by the end of the year (and more in the months to follow!).</p> \n    <p>Since\
  \ the cameras are flying fast and furious at Book Expo, we wanted to take this chance\
  \ to let the goblins out of the bag ourselves, lest you find the news too incredibly\
  \ awesome to believe.</p> \n    <p>Believe it, my friends. The <a href=\"/products/btpy8t2m\"\
  >(plush) goblins</a> are coming.</p> \n    <p>And they are hungry!</p> \n    <p>Keep\
  \ your eyes on the Paizo Blog for more details about these awesome plush creatures\
  \ as they develop, and post your suggestions for additional goblin looks you'd like\
  \ us to try out in the future in the comments below!</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br>\
