  \ Just Keeps Getting Better</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, September 9, 2008</p>\
  \ \n   <p>I've got a problem. </p> \n   <p>See, <a href=\"/paizo/blog/2008/april\"\
  >back in April I did one of these blog posts</a> about <a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy7zdr\"\
  ><i>The Ginger Star</i></a>, the first of Leigh Brackett's three Skaith books. In\
  \ it, I talked all about how she's my favorite <a href=\"/planetstories\">Planet\
  \ Stories</a> author so far, and how <a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy7zdr\"><i>The\
  \ Ginger Star</i></a> is hands-down the most fun-to-read book in our line to date.\
  \ I was fair, but I was effusive, as the world she painted was a beautiful blend\
  \ of fantasy and sci-fi (as is the case with so much far-future apocalyptic fiction),\
  \ a work of a sword-and-planet genius that seems more akin to Tolkien or <i>Star\
  \ Wars</i> than Edgar Rice Burroughs. It lit me up, and I shouted it from the rooftops.\
  \ And now I'm in a bind. </p> \n   <p>Because <a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy81tw\"\
  ><i>The Hounds of Skaith</i></a> is better. Way better. </p> \n   <p>In this sequel\
  \ to <a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy7zdr\"><i>The Ginger Star</i></a>, Brackett\
  \ has more of everything I loved from the first book. More strange aliens. More\
  \ bizarre and yet immediately familiar cultures. More battle scenes, more fights\
  \ with telepathic hound-beasts, more starships and political theory and morally\
  \ ambiguous bad guys getting what's coming to them. New nations and landscapes (and\
  \ an additional map of the world as well, courtesy of Rob Lazzaretti). Without the\
  \ need to explain who Eric John Stark is and why he's there, Brackett is free to\
  \ keep pushing the envelope and packing every scene with more wonder. One of the\
  \ things I love most about Brackett is actually one of the things that originally\
  \ attracted me to China Miéville (who was born just six years before her death...\
  \ Ms. Brackett was light years ahead of her time). Both of them have so many ideas\
  \ that they can afford to just toss them away with a line or two. The beautiful,\
  \ perfect Yur men, for instance, whose women are like shrieking, pale grubs—Leigh\
  \ may only have given them a paragraph, but the image has stuck with me ever since.\
  \ </p> \n   <p>So what can I say? I spoke too soon. My only hope at this point is\
  \ that, when it comes time to release <a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy83x7\"><i>The\
  \ Reavers of Skaith</i></a>, I'll be referring back to this post in much the same\
  \ fashion. Call me crazy, but something tells me Brackett isn't quite finished yet.\
