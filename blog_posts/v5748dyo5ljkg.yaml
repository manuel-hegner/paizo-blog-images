  \  <p itemprop=\"description\"><i>Mirian Raas and her faithful crew make their living\
  \ salvaging lost treasures from sunken ships along the coast of tropical Sargava.\
  \ While retrieving riches from the bottom of Desperation Bay, Mirian and her friend\
  \ Jekka, one of the last of his lizardfolk tribe, unexpectedly run across the wreck\
  \ of an ancient magical ship. The discovery leads them on a quest for an arcane\
  \ artifact called a dragon's tear, which may be the key to locating Jekka's vanished\
  \ people. But a vengeful sorcerer and a zealous agent of the Child-God Walkena also\
  \ seek the dragon's tear—and they'll stop at nothing to get it. Can Mirian and her\
  \ crew pass through the legendary gate in the sea and find the tear before it's\
  \ too late?</i></p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <h2>Chapter 2: The Black Ship</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>As she played the glow stone over the hull, Mirian imagined the vessel\
  \ surging along the waves in its glory days, full canvas spread from the trio of\
  \ towering masts, the dragon-shaped prow rising and falling with the ocean current.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>And then she was once more staring at a sunken hulk.</p> \n     <p>She\
  \ was swimming slowly toward the bow, wand at the ready, when Jekka joined her.\
  \ She gave him the hand sign for caution. There was no telling what might be using\
  \ the wreck as its home.</p> \n     <p>The figurehead was even more lovely than\
  \ she'd supposed, carved with that minute detail she'd seen on many lizardfolk objects.\
  \ Upon closer inspection, Mirian recognized it as a stylized rendition of one of\
  \ her least favorite creatures: a sea drake. She scowled at the thing. One of the\
  \ monsters had stalked her when she was a child, and another had chased her expedition\
  \ through the tunnels of a lizardfolk city before killing her friend Ivrian's mother.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Her hand tightened around the wand and she came perilously close to\
  \ blasting the serpentine image into floating chunks.</p> \n     <p>But she had\
  \ better sense. Provided they could get the figurehead free, they'd probably get\
  \ a tidy sum for it from some collector. As a member of the Pathfinder Society,\
  \ she knew not to let personal feeling interfere with a historical find.</p> \n\
  \     <p>Mirian drifted away from the figurehead and back along the narrow bow,\
  \ light from her glow stone glinting off something half hidden in scum. She swam\
  \ closer to investigate.</p> \n     <p>A lumpy object was set into the ship's side\
  \ six feet below the rail and about the same distance from the bowsprit, in the\
  \ approximate place that Osirian mariners painted eyes on their ships.</p> \n  \
  \   <p>Often she wore gloves on salvage runs, but having anticipated recovering\
  \ nothing more than a ring down here, she'd dived without them. She reached to touch\
  \ the object gingerly with her left hand, wiping fingers through grime to reveal\
  \ a large violet jewel.</p> \n     <p>At that her eyebrows rose. If this were a\
  \ real gem, it could easily be worth thousands of gold sails.</p> \n     <p>Realizing\
  \ she'd been focused single-mindedly upon her discovery, she checked behind, above,\
  \ and around her. Her father had taught her not to be so intent you forgot your\
  \ surroundings. <i>Nearly everything under the water is a predator</i>, he'd told\
  \ her, and <i>some of them are larger than you</i>.</p> \n     <p>She saw Jekka's\
  \ light still playing farther back. Time to confer. She swam over to him and the\
  \ lizard man's slit pupils contracted in her light beam. She shined the light at\
  \ her hand so he could see her signal to surface.</p> \n     <p>His tongue extended,\
  \ as it sometimes did when he was thoughtful or uncertain, but he followed as she\
  \ kicked up, and in a few moments they were drifting in the darkness under the stars.\
  \ Mirian's instinctive sense of direction told her the <i>Daughter of the Mist</i>\
  \ lay to her left, but she couldn't see it, or even hear the lap of the ocean against\
  \ its side.</p> \n     <p>\"Isn't it amazing, my sister?\" Jekka asked. \"A ship\
  \ of my people!\"</p> \n     <p>\"It is amazing. I'd give a lot to know what they\
  \ painted on the hull to preserve it so well. But there are two things, my brother.\
  \ Listen well.\"</p> \n     <p>Sometimes, when she spoke with the lizard man, Mirian\
  \ found herself unintentionally adopting his formal diction. She supposed she was\
  \ learning some of his habits, just as he learned some of hers.</p> \n     <p>\"\
  You have my attention,\" he answered.</p> \n     <p>\"You <i>must</i> always signal\
  \ me. And be watching for me, underwater. Don't dart off like that.\"</p> \n   \
  \  <p>He nodded, an exaggerated bob on that long neck.</p> \n     <p>\"We have to\
  \ watch for each other,\" she went on, \"because there may be something watching\
  \ us.\"</p> \n     <p>\"So you have said. Forgive me, Sister.\"</p> \n     <p>\"\
  No harm done—yet. Don't forget, you need to swim back to the ship and report in.\
  \ Tell Rendak what we've found and borrow his air bottle.\"</p> \n     <p>\"I don't\
  \ need it.\"</p> \n     <p>\"You damned well do. You can't keep popping up and down\
  \ the whole time. I want to go inside the hull and look around, and I want someone\
  \ to back me up. You could get trapped in the hull and drown.\"</p> \n     <p>\"\
  I don't need it,\" he repeated stubbornly.</p> \n     <p>\"You promised to defer\
  \ to me in salvaging. Are you going back on your word?\"</p> \n     <p>He hissed.\
  \ \"You shame me, Sister. Very well. But how am I to watch you if you're going alone\
  \ to the wreck?\"</p> \n     <p>\"You're going to come back quickly. And I'm going\
  \ to continue my inspection on the outside.\" Not the safest option, admittedly,\
  \ but Mirian was an old hand at this, and the seas seemed pretty calm at this drop.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"I will do these things.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Thank the druid while you're\
  \ there,\" she continued, \"and apologize to her for the delay. Tell Rendak to turn\
  \ four points to starboard and come a half mile before dropping anchor. And when\
  \ he asks if he or Gombe should drop, tell him I'll let them know when we're done\
  \ scouting.\"</p> \n     <p>\"I will remember,\" Jekka assured her.</p> \n     <p>She\
  \ was fairly certain he would. The lizard man had an amazing ability to retain oral\
  \ information and repeat it word for word. Habits, like those of salvaging routines,\
  \ however, were different from rote memorization.</p> \n     <p>\"Get it done and\
  \ come find me. I'm as eager as you to see what lies aboard.\"</p> \n     <p>Then\
  \ she raised a hand in farewell and dove below.</p> \n     <p>On her return trip\
  \ to the wreck, she wondered what would have happened if she'd descended for the\
  \ ring alone, or with Rendak or Gombe. Nothing, probably. She'd chosen Jekka in\
  \ part because he needed to get used to what a salvaging run was like, but also\
  \ because he'd been so excited to become a salvager. She guessed that was because\
  \ he now saw the crew as part of his extended clan and wished to contribute to its\
  \ well-being.</p> \n     <p>While she waited for Jekka, she carefully surveyed the\
  \ ship's perimeter, familiarizing herself with the length and breadth of the vessel\
  \ and searching for telltale warning signs that something large and unpleasant lurked\
  \ within. Ocean predators weren't especially noted for their intellects. If there\
  \ were anything nasty living here, there'd likely be discarded carcasses nearby,\
  \ each crawling with bottom-feeders.</p> \n     <p>She saw no such indications.\
  \ That didn't rule out the possibility of more intelligent creatures like aquatic\
  \ ogres or sea devils lairing there, but she saw no sign of tracks or prints along\
  \ the rail or upon any of the closed cabin doors leading into the bowels of the\
  \ ship.</p> \n     <p>Mirian almost missed the large gash at the vessel's stern,\
  \ in the shadow of the hull. She studied the damaged wood and realized she was probably\
  \ looking at the ship's death wound. Most likely the ship had struck a reef.</p>\

  \ <br><i>Illustration by Igor Grechanyi</i>\n     </div> \n     <p>After a careful\
  \ examination, Mirian had a pretty clear picture of the ship. It was half again\
  \ as long as a typical three-master, but perhaps a third shallower across the beam.\
  \ The decks were high and rose steeply at the prow. Probably there were a good three\
  \ decks below, and back of the quarterdeck were two more above. Two masts were forward\
  \ and a mizzenmast stood broken off almost to the deck, right through the wheelhouse\
  \ itself.</p> \n     <p>Mirian was looking at the wheel when Jekka finally rejoined\
  \ her. He took hold of the wheel with one hand to steady himself. Straps of a haversack\
  \ crossed his chest.</p> \n     <p>Jekka had slid an object used by the other salvagers\
  \ in her crew into a side pocket of his haversack. The magic item was colloquially\
  \ known as an air bottle, and once someone learned the trick of using one, it was\
  \ possible to spend long hours below the water. Her grandfather had invested in\
  \ two for the family's help, and hit upon the idea of a tube to affix to the bottle\
  \ so the fragile object could be kept in a padded back satchel.</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ tube worked much better if you had lips to close around it—something Jekka lacked.\
  \ When he'd first attempted to use it, he couldn't pull air without water coming\
  \ in as well, unless he jammed the tube so far down his throat he nearly gagged.\
  \ She understood why he didn't want to repeat the experience, but he'd have to adapt\
  \ if he was going to be a salvager.</p> \n     <p>A cool current buffeted Mirian\
  \ as she examined a peculiar column rising beside the wheel. At first glance, it\
  \ looked like another mast had been sheared off, but that made no sense. That would\
  \ have placed it off-center from the rest of the vessel.</p> \n     <p>She scraped\
  \ at a layer of blue algae. Instead of a broken mast, she uncovered a diagonal plate\
  \ resembling a display in an expensive jewelry shop. An array of gems was set into\
  \ its black metal. She scrubbed harder, exposing tiny symbols incised beside each\
  \ jewel.</p> \n     <p>Jekka leaned close, running his scaly fingers over the letters.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The writing certainly resembled the same language Mirian had seen on\
  \ the lizardfolk book cones, but she knew many languages looked similar to the uninitiated.\
  \ She pointed to the symbols and then back at Jekka.</p> \n     <p>The lizard man\
  \ nodded vigorously and touched a set of characters. \"No wind!\" he shouted, air\
  \ bubbling out of his mouth.</p> \n     <p>He put his fingers beside a flat, violet\
  \ stone, and it took him three attempts before she could understand him through\
  \ the water: \"Opener of the way.\"</p> \n     <p>Jekka paused to suck in the tube,\
  \ then pulled it out, coughing more air bubbles.</p> \n     <p>There were four more\
  \ gems with inscriptions. Mirian spread her hands apart in a silent question.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Clearly perplexed, the lizard man shook his head.</p> \n     <p>She\
  \ traced the multifaceted ruby he'd told her meant \"no wind.\" It looked like it\
  \ might turn in its pitted housing.</p> \n     <p>Interesting. Slowly, carefully,\
  \ she set her fingers on the gem and tried moving it clockwise. It didn't budge.\
  \ When she twisted in the other direction, the gem lit from within.</p> \n     <p>Mirian\
  \ looked to Jekka for explanation, but he merely shrugged.</p> \n     <p>She made\
  \ a second twist and the deck shook beneath them. Clouds of silt billowed up, and\
  \ from somewhere below came a loud scraping noise. It wasn't until she looked to\
  \ port and turned her beam there that she noticed the landscape moving&nbsp;...</p>\
  \ \n     <p>No, the ship was! Mirian let out a colorful oath and quickly twisted\
  \ the jewel all the way to the right so that it returned to its original setting.\
  \ It ceased glowing and the ship slowed.</p> \n     <p>She looked at Jekka as if\
  \ to say, <i>What the hell was that?</i></p> \n     <p>The lizard man stared back\
  \ at her, reptilian eyes blinking.</p> \n     <p>This was a major find, but there\
  \ was no way they'd pry any of the gems out of here. \"No wind\" apparently meant\
  \ the ship could be set in motion magically when there was no breeze. She marveled\
  \ at that, wondering whether a skilled enough magic-worker could remove it from\
  \ the ship and install it on another. Like, say, the <i>Daughter of the Mist</i>,\
  \ or that behemoth Ivrian was so set on building.</p> \n     <p>She pointed to an\
  \ opening into darkness and directed her glow stone onto a barnacle-encrusted ladder.\
  \ Apparently only the hull had the special protective coating.</p> \n     <p>Jekka\
  \ tapped his chest and pointed into the hold, letting her know he intended to lead,\
  \ then brandished his own glow stone.</p> \n     <p>She almost objected, then decided\
  \ he was at least communicating this time, and remembered he was both an experienced\
  \ warrior and excited to be searching a ship made by his own people. She allowed\
  \ him to swim in front, staying a few feet back from the swish of his whiplike tale.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Most of the hold's contents had shifted to starboard. Her light played\
  \ over brown and green weeds dusted by occasional splotches of red and blue. They\
  \ obscured the hold's contents in a soft, furry blanket.</p> \n     <p>Jekka floated\
  \ above it all, shining his own light on something to the right, then pointed at\
  \ a long segmented worm with pincers. Mirian's father had always called them rot\
  \ worms, though to Mirian they looked more like oversized centipedes. Their bite\
  \ was deadly poisonous and they tended to be aggressive when disturbed, so she moved\
  \ quickly.</p> \n     <p>The arm-length creature shifted away at Jekka's spear thrust,\
  \ rearing up and stirring the water with its legs. Mirian cut it in half with her\
  \ cutlass. It floated apart, wriggling in its death throes.</p> \n     <p>Jekka\
  \ brushed it out of the way and shined his light on the patch of growth where the\
  \ rot worm had been hidden. It didn't seem to have any nest mates.</p> \n     <p>She\
  \ floated on with Jekka, imagining the hold moving with robed lizardfolk, perhaps\
  \ lashing down that stack of crates over there, or walking on through the narrow\
  \ archway into the next chamber.</p> \n     <p>Jekka stopped beside three large\
  \ chests resting against the hull, each rotten with age. As Mirian played her light\
  \ over the area, tiny crustaceans swam frantically for darkness. Little silver fish\
  \ flashed away in alarm.</p> \n     <p>Mirian signaled Jekka to keep watch and he\
  \ turned from her to survey their surroundings.</p> \n     <p>She had never seen\
  \ a lizardfolk chest before, but the one directly before her proved little different\
  \ from those built by humans, save that the lock mechanism was inset along the top\
  \ right. That in itself was of interest. She made a mental note to record the information\
  \ in her Pathfinder journal.</p> \n     <p>Normally, she would have simply smashed\
  \ open a chest this old and rotten, but it was such an odd, rare find she wanted\
  \ to handle it with care.</p> \n     <p>The bronze lock was green with corrosion\
  \ and looked as though it had been designed to accommodate a cylindrical mechanism\
  \ rather than a key—far beyond her lock-picking abilities, but there were other\
  \ ways. She removed a small pry bar from her pack and set to work on the hinges.</p>\
  \ \n     <div class=\"blurb360\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8537-Jekka.jpg\"\

  \ <br> <i>Illustration by Roberto Pitturru</i>\n     </div> \n     <p>The tool's\
  \ teeth sank easily into the rotten wood, and in moments both hinges were floating\
  \ free. After that, the lid came up easily. Mirian drifted back as she lifted it.\
  \ There was no telling what might come crawling out.</p> \n     <p>Nothing did.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>She again swam closer, her light settling on a rotted wooden frame inside\
  \ the chest that kept a dozen blue cylindrical bottles upright and separate. Five\
  \ were broken along their necks, but the others, though empty, looked intact—more\
  \ tube than jar, with a peculiar fluted opening at the top.</p> \n     <p>Mirian\
  \ played the light over the inside, then carefully lifted one of the vessels free\
  \ and drew it closer it for examination.</p> \n     <p>Jekka drifted beside her.\
  \ His long, forked tongue flicked with excitement.</p> \n     <p>She looked at him\
  \ questioningly.</p> \n     <p>His head cocked in interest and he mimed drinking\
  \ with it.</p> \n     <p>Mirian handed it to him to examine, then signed for him\
  \ to put it in his pack. They could spend months clearing this wreck. It was probably\
  \ time to fetch Rendak and Gombe.</p> \n     <p>Desna had truly blessed them. The\
  \ wreck was a fantastic find. There was no telling what sort of oddities might be\
  \ left aboard, let alone their value and historical significance. As a salvager,\
  \ she depended upon scavenging sites like this. But as a Pathfinder, she was dedicated\
  \ to uncovering the secrets of Golarion's past to preserve and disseminate knowledge.\
  \ If the magical wind mechanism built into this ship could be understood and replicated,\
  \ it might very well change the future of sea travel.</p> \n     <p>Jekka pointed\
  \ to the chest next to the one they'd opened. He clearly wanted to see what was\
  \ inside.</p> \n     <p>She decided to humor him and signaled for him to guard once\
  \ more.</p> \n     <p>The hinges on the second chest were even more worn, and yielded\
  \ with no resistance.</p> \n     <p>Within stood twelve rows of sculpted lizardfolk\
  \ heads fashioned from a thin metal alloy and inlaid with jewels. Each eye socket\
  \ was set with amber stones, the figures themselves rich with the minute symbols\
  \ of Jekka's people.</p> \n     <p>The sight so thrilled her blood brother that\
  \ his frill rose, and Mirian had to remind him to keep watch, though she did acquiesce\
  \ to setting all two dozen of the sculptures within her pack.</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ haversacks they wore had been gifts from Ivrian's mother, and were ensorcelled\
  \ to contain more space on the inside than was apparent without. All of the sculptures\
  \ fit easily without altering the haversack's weight in the slightest, another wonderful\
  \ feature.</p> \n     <p>Jekka signed to indicate they should open the third chest,\
  \ but she shook her head and pointed to the surface. Then she looked back to the\
  \ chests and smiled, trying to reassure him they'd come back for all of it.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Mirian led the way out. Jekka trailed some length after, seemingly reluctant\
  \ to leave.</p> \n     <p>Sooner than expected she found the anchor chain and, looming\
  \ above, the dark bowline of the <i>Daughter of the Mist</i>.</p> \n     <p>Her\
  \ hands closed on the familiar rungs of the ladder built into the vessel's side.\
  \ She felt the magical gills fade the moment she thrust her head above the water\
  \ and breathed deeply of the crisp salty air.</p> \n     <p>All was silhouettes\
  \ and shadows against the lesser darkness of the sky, but she thought she made out\
  \ Gombe's lean outline near the ladder. She grinned at him as she stepped forward,\
  \ slinging her bag off her shoulder.</p> \n     <p>\"You won't believe what we've\
  \ found,\" she told him.</p> \n     <p>A man with a sword stepped around Gombe,\
  \ the point of the weapon at the first mate's throat. \"I'm all ears.\"</p> \n \
