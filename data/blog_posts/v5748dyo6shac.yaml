  \ \n     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">“They tell stories of\
  \ this stuff up in Ustalav. Call it ‘fishgold’,” Jirelle said as she turned the\
  \ heavy statuette over in her hands. The craft of the ugly thing wasn’t impressive,\
  \ but the value of the red-tinted gold was undeniable. “You should throw it back.”\
  </p> \n      <p>Captain Trank’s eyes widened comically, and Jirelle was again struck\
  \ by how unappealing the man’s countenance was—and how appropriate the name of his\
  \ ship was. “Throw it back?” he gasped. “This thing’s gotta be worth at least a\
  \ hundred gold. You’re asking me to throw treasure overboard because some backwards\
  \ lubber thousands of miles away has some sort of superstition? What kind of mercenary\
  \ are you? You afraid of getting rich or something?”</p> \n      <p>Jirelle shrugged.\
  \ “You called me in here to ask my opinion. I gave it. You hired me to help protect\
  \ the <em>Seatoad</em> from danger. I did it. But I’m not part of your crew, so\
  \ I don’t have to put up with your ignorance. Your stubbornness. Your lack of empathy.\
  \ But regardless of what I think about you personally, and regardless of the fact\
  \ that we’ve arrived at port, I’ve grown fond of your crew. So that makes me concerned\
  \ for the <em>Seatoad's</em> safety. The ones who craft fishgold don’t give up on\
  \ their creations easily when they’re snatched from their clutches. If you value\
  \ your crew and your ship... you should throw it back,” she repeated as she tossed\
  \ the statuette onto the cluttered desk amid Trank’s tacky collection of figurines.\
  \ She tried not to look too pleased as the top-heavy thing flopped over and smashed\
  \ a particularly ostentatious ceramic toad.</p> \n      <p>As she stood up, she\
  \ again cast a disparaging eye over the furnishing of Captain Trank’s quarters.\
  \ A real captain of the Shackles wouldn’t be caught dead among such base frippery.\
  \ She wiped her palm against the back of the chair, as if to try to scrape the scent\
  \ of fishgold from her hand. Captain Trank was sputtering. “How dare you? You’re\
  \ lucky I don’t have you clapped in irons for disrespecting me, elf! You can forget\
  \ about your bonus!”</p> \n      <p>Jirelle paused, mid-step toward the door. “\
  Half-elf,” she said under her breath. Her hand dropped to the hilt of her sword\
  \ as she started to turn. “And for another thing, Trank...” she began, deliberately\
  \ omitting his title, only to pause as the alarm bell rang out on deck. Both of\
  \ them listened to the crew’s screams for a heartbeat before Jirelle flashed the\
  \ captain a dazzling smile. “...it sounds like I’m about to earn that bonus after\
  \ all</p> \n      <p>She threw the door open and leapt out on deck, not surprised\
  \ in the slightest to see a scaly green tide seething up over the <em>Seatoad's</em>\
  \ bulwarks. While Jirelle recognized the creatures as ulat-kinis (or more commonly\
  \ “skums” to those surface folk the creatures often preyed upon), she didn’t understand\
  \ the guttural language the creatures were shrieking. Nonetheless, she knew what\
  \ they wanted. Blood for fishgold.</p> \n      <p>There were over a dozen of them\
  \ already on deck, and she could see half again as many more clambering up onto\
  \ the pier the <em>Seatoad</em> had docked at. Further out, villagers were yelling\
  \ and pointing and screaming, but Jirelle knew that there’d be no aid from them\
  \ in time to save the crew. She barked a laugh, drew her sword, and leapt into the\
  \ fray.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/070620_Jirelle.jpg\"\

  \ alt=\"Pathfinder Iconic Jirelle\"></a>\n       <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Jirelle,\
  \ the iconic swashbuckler, swings into action in this exciting illustration by Stefano\
  \ Moroni from the <i><a href=\"“https://paizo.com/products/btq023ih?Pathfinder-Advanced-Players-Guide”\
  \">Pathfinder Advanced Player’s Guide</a></i>, available everywhere July 30!</p>\n\
  \      </div> \n      <p>The crew was already engaging the ulat-kinis, but it was\
  \ obvious that against a foe driven by vengeance and armed with claws, teeth, and\
  \ tridents, the <em>Seatoad's</em> sailors were outmatched. Jirelle leapt up onto\
  \ the bulwarks and raced along the narrow beam to where the nearest skum was preparing\
  \ to skewer the bosun. She whipped her bright red cloak out, cracking it like a\
  \ whip in front of the leering monster, and as he foolishly snapped at it, Jirelle\
  \ was already behind him. The creature snarled, then spun to face her.</p> \n  \
  \    <p>“Best of luck in the next life, fishlips,” she said, then held up her sword\
  \ in a salute. It was already dripping with blood, and the ulat-kini was already\
  \ collapsing to the deck from the precise, killing blow she’d struck before it realized\
  \ it’d been stabbed.</p> \n      <p>Jirelle bounced from the bulwarks onto a rain\
  \ barrel near the mast. Balancing atop the open barrel with a foot on each edge,\
  \ she called out to the slavering sea of green on deck before her. “Leave them alone!\
  \ The one who has your gold’s back in the cabin behind me!” She shook her head as\
  \ the creatures shrieked and hissed and slobbered, obviously not understanding her\
  \ words, but she had their attention. That’s what really mattered.</p> \n      <p>As\
  \ the ulat-kinis scrambled forward, Jirelle kicked with one foot, tipping the barrel\
  \ over onto its side. The sudden deluge of water was enough to knock one skum from\
  \ its feet, and as she ran atop the rolling barrel, the others watched in disbelief—\
  up until the point the heavy barrel smashed into a pair of them, knocking them over\
  \ as well.</p> \n      <p>Jirelle had vacated her position atop the barrel an instant\
  \ before it bowled the two fishy creatures over and now clung to a rope in the rigging\
  \ along the ship’s port side. Her blade swept to the left, then the right, catching\
  \ and turning aside trident thrusts and replying with precisely delivered jabs of\
  \ her own. As the creatures dropped to the increasingly bloody deck below, Jirelle\
  \ caught sight of what could only be their leader. With a particularly wicked looking\
  \ trident gripped in his hands, the ulat-kini commander had clambered up onto the\
  \ nearby pier and was barking out commands to the scaly masses.</p> \n      <p>With\
  \ a slash that simultaneously cut the neck of a skum and the rope bound to a cleat\
  \ at her feet, Jirelle used the momentum to swing out over the churning gap between\
  \ the <em>Seatoad</em> and the pier. She landed with a pirouette, then came up to\
  \ face the monster with a wink. The creature’s eyes widened as it took a step back,\
  \ surprised that the half-elf was suddenly perched on a piling just above him.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>“You the one in charge here?” she asked, not caring if the commander\
  \ understood her or not. Her blade stabbed out, precisely striking the creature\
  \ between the gills, confidently finishing him off with a twist of the wrist. As\
  \ the commander toppled into the waters below the pier with a foamy red gurgle,\
  \ she whipped her blade to the side to clean it of blood. “Oh... guess not anymore!”\
  </p> \n      <p>The sound of the remaining ulat-kinis crying out in fear and the\
  \ splashes as they dove from the <em>Seatoad’s</em> deck into the waters below brought\
  \ a smile to Jirelle’s lips, but as she turned to look back at the ship she’d been\
  \ hired to protect for the past several weeks, that smile broadened.</p> \n    \
  \  <p>It hadn’t been her displays of panache and bravado that had driven the monsters\
  \ off. It was the sight of the bright red tentacles slithering up from the sea to\
  \ grip the <em>Seatoad</em> by the stern that had done that. Captain Trank’s squeal\
  \ of shocked fear was unmistakable as a tentacle slithered in through a cabin porthole.\
  \ The crew had largely abandoned the ship by now and were fleeing up the pier to\
  \ the shore, but as unappealing as the captain had been, Jirelle wasn’t about to\
  \ let him be pulled below by whatever was attached to the unseen end of those tentacles.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>She swung back from the pier onto the ship’s deck, already anticipating\
  \ Trank’s reaction to being saved by the woman he’d just insulted. The ulat-kinis\
  \ may have fled, but as Jirelle stepped forward to start cutting away at those writhing\
  \ crimson limbs, she knew that the real fun was only just beginning!</p> \n    \
