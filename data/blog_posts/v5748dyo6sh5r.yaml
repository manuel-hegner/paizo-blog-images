  \ Social Media Producer. Just like us here at Paizo, you are probably stuck at home\
  \ due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Meaning your weekly game sessions with friends around\
  \ the table might have stopped. So I wanted to help people find ways to help your\
  \ friends continue the adventure.</p> \n      <p>This Pathfinder &amp; Starfinder\
  \ Home Gaming Guide is built to help introduce you to various tools and tips to\
  \ smoothly get your campaign back on track. Since I have generally played tabletop\
  \ RPGs online, I want to share what I’ve learned with all of you.</p> \n      <p>If\
  \ you have any tips and tricks you’d like to add to this guide, please leave a comment\
  \ down below this blog, or help out another fellow player on social media!</p> \n\

  \ Edition Core Rulebook, but it has a lot of amazing tools and features to manage\
  \ your campaign. Features like animated maps, weather effects, line of sight, an\
  \ intuitive interface to help keep up with the game’s rules, and so much more! I\
  \ have been using Astral to run demos of Pathfinder Second Edition, and I love it\
  \ more and more every session. With its easy drag and drop interface, I find myself\
  \ being able to Game Master fairly efficiently with my improv style storytelling.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Astral as of this time is opening up their paid features for free until\
  \ the end of April, so for newbies and veterans of virtual tabletop, now is the\
  \ time to give Astral a try. </p> \n      <p>For those needing help learning how\
