  date\">Tuesday, November 17, 2009</p> \n   <p>Cave raptors are sated; it's time\
  \ to blog!</p> \n   <p>Back when I was a little ankle-chewer in the distant 1980s,\
  \ there weren't a lot of strong female role models to choose from. Most of the women\
  \ on TV were simpering damsels in distress or so fashion- and boy-crazy that they\
  \ triggered my normally resilient goblin gag reflex. Then in 1985, Mattel rolled\
  \ out She-Ra and my youthful, violent fanaticism found someone to latch onto. She-Ra\
  \ still had a lot of fashion doll in her, but she had something that no other female\
  \ character did: a friggin' sword! For a long while, She-Ra was my favorite show,\
  \ and I still remember it fondly today, even if the series hasn't aged well.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>And why in Lamashtu's name have I forced us all down this horrifying stagger\
  \ through memory lane? So that it will really drive home the point when I say quite\
  \ plainly: Jirel of Joiry would kick She-Ra's alabaster ass!</p> \n   <p>For this\
  \ week's installment of Sci-Fried, I picked up a copy of the Planet Stories collection\
  \ <a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy7x8d\"><i>Black God's Kiss</i></a>. Last time\
  \ around, I enjoyed Kuttner's work on <a href=\" /planetStories/v5748btpy81tx\"\
  ><i>The Dark World</i></a>, and in my research (and by research, I mean dumpster-diving\
  \ in Wikipedia) I discovered that he co-wrote most of his later novels with his\
  \ wife, C. L. Moore.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <table border=\"0\" align=\"left\"\

  \   </tbody>\n  </table> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>So, major spoilers: C. L. Moore\
  \ is a woman!</p> \n   <p>Armed with the knowledge that women can write science\
  \ fiction, I eagerly dove into <i>Black God's Kiss</i>. And I was not disappointed.\
  \ The intrusion of pesky adventurers kept me from finishing all six thrilling tales,\
  \ as their larcenous halfling made off with my copy in the fracas. But the first\
  \ three short stories were more than enough to whet my appetite and have me picking\
  \ up a replacement copy today at work.</p> \n   <p><i>Black God's Kiss</i> collects\
  \ Moore's six Jirel of Joiry stories into one convenient volume. The original badass,\
  \ no-excuses warrior woman before Xena and Lara Croft made it cool, Jirel is the\
  \ military commander (and later queen) of Joiry, a medieval French territory. She's\
  \ the best swordswoman in the kingdom, the toughest brawler, and supremely focused\
  \ on whatever her goal might be. She's every bit as violent as I am, but with all\
  \ the self-confidence and human emotions I usually use my violence to compensate\
  \ for.</p> \n   <p>But like an octopus without its legs, a cool character isn't\
  \ much to look at if the writing is sub par. And Moore is par excellence. Moore's\
  \ writing is like an expensive meal. You get the nourishing plot, of course, but\
  \ what you really love is just putting the prose in your mouth and chewing, savoring\
  \ those flavorful descriptions and the rich balance of analogies. It's like eating\
  \ a pickle made out of tasty Halfling toes.</p> \n   <blockquote> \n    <p> \"But\
  \ the darkness that bandaged her eyes was changed too, indescribably. It was no\
  \ longer darkness, but void; not an absence of light, but simple nothingness.\"\
  </p> \n   </blockquote> \n   <p>That is art. It combines such simple ingredients\
  \ to create an elegant whole and makes me understand a concept I could never personally\
  \ experience without visiting family. It makes me want to backtrack, taste it again,\
  \ and learn how to cook it myself. Jirel's travels beyond reality are so lip-smackingly\
  \ vivid that they pull me in, despite the book's glaring minority of cephalopods.</p>\
  \ \n   <p><a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy7x8d\"> <i>Black God's Kiss</i></a>\
  \ is an exciting and fun collection of adventures with the kind of action-adventure\
  \ hero that anyone can enjoy, and any gamer girl and empathize with. This isn't\
  \ just a book I enjoy reading, this is a book I'm going to enjoy reading to my daughter\
  \ some day...</p> \n   <p>Provided I can override my natural instincts to eat my\
  \ young.</p> \n   <p>Well, third time's the charm.</p> \n   <p>Crystal Frasier <br>Production\
