  >No sane person would leave Jalmeray to venture to the small, lawless island of\
  \ Veedesha, which lay just off the coast, but Anandi had business there on behalf\
  \ of the thakur. </p> \n    <p><i>The business of his Maurya-Rahm, more likely</i>.\
  \ The thakur's advisors had heard rumors of illicit trades going on in Veedesha,\
  \ and while they often turned a blind eye to such occurrences when they didn't concern\
  \ them, this time reports of a certain potentially devastating magical item had\
  \ them on edge.</p> \n    <p><i>And do they send a soldier or a monk? No, they send\
  \ Jalmeray’s best courtesan</i>. </p> \n    <p>He wasn't fond of the Maurya-Rahm,\
  \ who'd been instrumental in arranging his dismissal as Asa's consort five years\
  \ before. Asa, being a Maurya-Rahm elevated enough to have the thakur's ear, had\
  \ made no secret of his fondness for Anandi and his skills. Unfortunately, he'd\
  \ also been particularly vulnerable to those coveting his position, and after a\
  \ spate of bitter rumors had been forced to send Anandi away. The severing had been\
  \ abrupt, brutal, and still stung.</p> \n    <p><i>The others were jealous, that’\
  s all, because I was loyal to one man alone and kept his trust</i>. Although the\
  \ Maurya-Rahm had thought to shame him by reducing him to a mere instructor of courtesan\
  \ at the Conservatory, he'd quickly proven talented at the job. That was his one\
  \ comfort. Now he had his choice of patrons and a collection of well-trained acolytes\
  \ to send out across Golarion to collect more secrets for Jalmeray's vaults. </p>\
  \ \n    <p>Yet separation from Asa didn't seem to be enough to prove to the Maurya-Rahm\
  \ that Anandi had no interest in their machinations.</p> \n    <p><i>So here I am\
  \ on a fool’s errand to prove my loyalty</i>.</p> \n    <p>He'd chosen his wardrobe\
  \ carefully, including a simple sword and leather boots. Dressing too poorly would\
  \ make him an easy target, as would dressing too richly. Better to be a carefree\
  \ man given to spending whatever money he earned lest he not live to see the next\
  \ day. </p> \n    <p>After arriving with the aid of two djinn who had flown him\
  \ across the ocean from the island of Grand Sarret, he walked through the decaying\
  \ cane fields to the old city, which was now little more than ruins. The original\
  \ buildings were still being used, though. Nearly every habitable place had been\
  \ taken over by rogues and pirates of all sorts. A market had been set up in the\
  \ central plaza, and purveyors of food, weapons repair, and supplies were doing\
  \ a brisk business. Ships littered the harbor, everything from pirates' galleons\
  \ to yellow-sailed slavers to smaller barques and luggers, speedy vessels meant\
  \ for smuggling and trade. </p> \n    <p>All in all, this was a place Anandi didn't\
  \ want to be, but when the Maurya-Rahm called...</p> \n    <p><i>I obey, in the\
  \ sad, sad hope that I might prove to them I’m a harmless, biddable servant</i>.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>It wasn't going to happen, he knew, but he kept trying.</p> \n    <p>A\
  \ flag bearing Captain Maldak's emblem alerted him to the proper abode, a villa\
  \ that was in somewhat better shape than many of the other buildings. Some of the\
  \ pirates had laid claim to one or another of the houses, and when in port, they\
  \ liked to come ashore and indulge in various entertainments.</p> \n    <p>One of\
  \ those entertainments leaned drunkenly over the balcony. His long, dark hair was\
  \ pulled back in a braid to reveal pointed ears, and from the tailored shirt and\
  \ pants, gold hoop earring, and rings on his fingers, he was definitely a favored\
  \ pet. The laces on his shirt were undone, exposing an enticing portion of bare\
  \ skin.</p> \n    <p>Anandi raked his attention away and turned it toward the pirate\
  \ keeping guard outside the villa's gate. She sat in a wooden chair and tilted it\
  \ back, her leg propped against a low wall. The sharp rasp of a whetstone echoed\
  \ in the stony courtyard as she honed her dagger. \"What brings you to the house\
  \ of Captain Maldak?\" she asked without looking up.</p> \n    <p>He leaned casually\
  \ against the wall. \"Wizard friend of mine sent me to look for a few things.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"In the market, are you? Come back at sunset and the captain'll be\
  \ in. Likes to entertain visitors then, he does.\"</p> \n    <p>Impatient as he\
  \ was to get what information he could and leave, Anandi decided to try a different\
  \ tactic. \"Where'd he come from?\" He nodded at the young man above them. </p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Him? No one knows for sure. Been here as long as we can remember.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"He's a pretty one.\"</p> \n    <p>\"That he is. Want a tumble with\
  \ him?\" The pirate gave Anandi a sly wink. \"He don't mind who he beds, so long\
  \ as he gets a bit of coin to buy his pesh.\"</p> \n    <p><i>Not only is he a whore,\
  \ he's a drug-addicted one</i>, Anandi thought sourly. Still, he knew better than\
  \ anyone that a prostitute could be an excellent source of information for the right\
  \ price.</p> \n    <p>\"What's his name?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Ravi. Ain't got no other.\"\
  \ Then, without asking permission, she stuck two fingers in her mouth and whistled.\
  \ \"Ravi, boy. You got a customer.\"</p> \n    <p>Anandi stood his ground, both\
  \ curious and repulsed as the gaudy creature disappeared inside and reappeared a\
  \ moment later strolling out the doorway. The young man paused to give the woman\
  \ a peck on the cheek and leaned against her as he studied Anandi. \"My, he's a\
  \ fancy man, ain't he?\"</p> \n    <p>\"How much?\" Anandi asked. </p> \n    <p>\"\
  How much you got?\" </p> \n    <p>He took a gold coin from his purse and tossed\
  \ it to the man. \"Will that give me an hour of your time?\"</p> \n    <p>The young\
  \ man grinned and gave him a mocking bow. \"This way, good sir.\"</p> \n    <div\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>When it comes to island-hopping, there's no better way to fly\
  \ than with a djinni.</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>\"Mind you bring him back, now,\"\
  \ the pirate said. \"Cap'll be asking for him later.\"</p> \n    <p>Anandi doffed\
  \ his cap and forced a smile. Then he followed Ravi along the beach until they reached\
  \ a trysting place sheltered behind a few boulders. The place was little more than\
  \ a lean-to, a roof covering a ragged mattress. Disgust rose in Anandi's throat.\
  \ </p> \n    <p>\"Not to your liking, sir?\" Ravi asked.</p> \n    <p>\"I'm not\
  \ interested in sharing your bed. I just want to talk.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Talk? Ain't\
  \ no one who wants to just <i>talk</i>.\" To emphasize his point, he pulled off\
  \ his fine shirt to reveal a slender, too-thin body marred by a few fading bruises.\
  \ He sidled up to Anandi and wrapped his arms around the older man's waist. </p>\
  \ \n    <p>Anandi resisted the urge to cover his nose to block the reek of sweat\
  \ and wine-scented breath. \"Perhaps a swim?\" </p> \n    <p>Ravi grinned and shucked\
  \ his pants. \"Last one in's a sand devil's dinner!\"</p> \n    <p>He ran haphazardly\
  \ toward the water. Anandi watched him go, annoyed by the ease with which he'd become\
  \ distracted. Ravi was filthy, crude, and likely had no information of use.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Yet he couldn't help grinning as he watched Ravi bounce around, seemingly\
  \ uncaring about how idiotic he appeared. Ravi went out a little farther and dove\
  \ under. </p> \n    <p>When he came back up, he was waving frantically and screaming\
  \ something unintelligible.</p> \n    <p><i>Shit.</i></p> \n    <p>Anandi tore off\
  \ his shirt and raced toward the water, yanking his boots off along the way. He\
  \ dove in, paddling hard until he reached the half-elf...</p> \n    <p>...who <i>wasn't</i>\
  \ drowning. Anandi stood up and yanked Ravi to his feet. The water was waist high,\
  \ and while subsequent waves hit his chest, there was no risk of being pulled under.\
  \ \"What the hell are you playing at?\"</p> \n    <p>Ravi clasped his face and pressed\
  \ their lips together. Anandi caught the bitter taste of wine before Ravi pulled\
  \ back. \"You're awfully stiff for a fancy man.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I'm soaked, and\
  \ it's your fault. Come on, wretch. Out.\"</p> \n    <p>He shoved Ravi toward the\
  \ beach. Once there, he peeled off his wet pants and laid them out to dry in the\
  \ sun. He ignored Ravi's stares and various lewd gestures, determined not to get\
  \ too close despite his interest in the young man. For an instructor of courtesans\
  \ to return home diseased would be a disgrace. </p> \n    <p>Defeated, Ravi sprawled\
  \ out in the sand, eyes closed. Anandi perched on a boulder and gazed down at him,\
  \ his mind starting to turn. The young man was likely older than he appeared, being\
  \ a half-elf, but he still had the look of an eighteen- or twenty-year-old Vudrani.\
  \ Spending any more thought on him was likely a waste of time, but there was something\
  \ about him that kept Anandi's attention. Behind those drink-glazed eyes was a glint\
  \ of intelligence, and he must have a great deal of skill at manipulating people\
  \ to have survived so long in this den of rogues and murderers. Unlike some of the\
  \ other slaves and prostitutes Anandi had seen, this one hadn't given up. He knew\
  \ how to play the game and meant to keep winning. It didn't take much to imagine\
  \ Ravi dressed in the fine, gauzy outfits favored at the Conservatory with cosmetics\
  \ darkening his eyes and set loose among some of Jalmeray's well-positioned denizens.</p>\
  \ \n    <p><i>What the hell am I thinking? I don't want anything to do with an ignorant\
  \ pesh addict like this. If I brought him back to the Conservatory, the Maurya-Rahm\
  \ would find a way to be rid of me for sure.</i></p> \n    <p>He forced the possibility\
  \ from his mind. There was work to do, after all, and Ravi was nothing more than\
  \ a means to an end. \"That captain must be a profitable one, seeing as how you\
  \ have all those fine clothes.\" </p> \n    <p>Ravi shaded his eyes with a hand\
  \ and gazed up at him. \"I know what you're fishing for, fancy man, and you ain't\
  \ going to get it. What the captain hauls is his business. Not mine, and definitely\
  \ not yours.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I was looking to make a trade. I've got a wizard friend\
  \ of mine looking for a very particular item.\"</p> \n    <p> \"Then it's the captain\
  \ you'll be wanting. Not me.\" </p> \n    <p>\"Have you ever seen him with any kind\
  \ of ancient artifacts? Mirrors, statues, a small brass bottle capped with lead?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"I seen all kinds of things, but Cap would use me for kraken bait\
  \ if he even thought I'd spilled any of his secrets,\" he said with such finality\
  \ that Anandi knew it was useless to pry any more. After a while, Ravi started to\
  \ shiver. \"You got any pesh on you?\"</p> \n    <p>\"No. I most certainly do not.\"\
  \ Annoyance crept into his voice. This afternoon had been a waste. He should have\
  \ known better than to bother with addicts.</p> \n    <p>Ravi sat up and reached\
  \ for his clothes. \"Too bad. Listen, I got to get back to the villa. It's been\
  \ fun and all, but...\"</p> \n    <p>\"But you need your pesh.\" He stared at Ravi,\
  \ calculating how best to earn his trust. \"Do you like living this way?\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"Ain't so bad,\" Ravi said as he dressed. \"I got everything I need.\"\
  \ He flashed his gem-studded rings for emphasis.</p> \n    <p>\"Everything?\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p> \"I don't need your pity, fancy man. I got a life here and I ain't ashamed.\
  \ I got lots of people who want me.\"</p> \n    <p>\"But do they want you or just\
  \ the fantasies you give them?\"</p> \n    <p>The saucy grin couldn't hide the pain\
  \ in Ravi's eyes. \"Go home, fancy man. I ain't got nothing you want.\" He walked\
  \ away, leaving Anandi feeling oddly guilty.</p> \n    <p>Then he shook it aside.\
  \ A few hours more and he'd be able to speak to the captain and get the hell off\
  \ this blasted island. </p> \n    <p><b>Coming Next Week:</b> Meeting the pirate\
