  \     </div> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\"></p>\n    \
  \  <p>&nbsp;“Can you at least tell me what it <em>does</em>?”</p> \n      <p>Lem\
  \ frowned down at the talisman. Feiya had just handed him a cord of braided sinew\
  \ hung with scraps of fabric and a small yellowed fang.</p> \n      <p>“All in due\
  \ time.” Feiya’s coyly reassuring smile almost achieved its goal. Her eyes betrayed\
  \ her, preoccupied as they were with scanning the darkened corners of the shop.\
  \ She was on the hunt, and even more terse than usual.</p> \n      <p>“Out of sight,\
  \ fang near a vein, yes? Parallel. When the entity manifests, draw its attention.\
  \ Then,” she growled through a predatory smile, “it’s <em>mine</em>.”</p> \n   \
  \   <p>“So,” she chirped, malice evaporated, “the surprise is intentional!”</p>\
  \ \n      <p>“Do consider how it might behoove you to be a bit more forthright?”\
  \ Lem offered cheerfully, shirt pulled over one shoulder as he tied the charm around\
  \ his bicep. “People appreciate directness! For instance, a witch might clearly\
  \ label her concoctions in order to assure others that… <em>hrm</em>. Feiya?”</p>\
  \ \n      <p>His willowy companion had drifted off around a rack of hats, their\
  \ broad brims embroidered with scenes of local myths and histories. Lem sighed,\
  \ dropped his shoulders slightly, and allowed a frown to darken his face. He sidestepped\
  \ in front of a fitting mirror.</p> \n      <p>“She’s not listening, is she, Lem?”\
  \ he asked his reflection morosely.</p> \n      <p>&nbsp;“No, Lem, I don’t believe\
  \ she is.” The mirrored image of Lem in the glass straightened, adopting a genteel\
  \ tone. “Foregoing the pleasure of our company to go ask a spider for its gallbladder.\
  \ Or some such.” Lem wrinkled his nose at himself. “Remember the rat?”</p> \n  \
  \    <p>“How could I forget?” Mirror Lem mourned anew. “All that chittering, night\
  \ after night. Daji said they preferred the ferns, but I think he just wanted an\
  \ excuse to make noise when we were sleeping.”</p> \n      <p>They’d been tracing\
  \ the Crushing Shadow for a few weeks, following a trail of property damage and\
  \ strangulations across inland Ravounel. As best they could tell their quarry wasn’\
  t a person, but some sort of magical force. Lem had picked up traces of hatred and\
  \ want from the recent murder sites, not as acrid as one would expect from a mortal\
  \ actor. They were attenuated—just not by time. With the most recent victim, they’\
  d arrived right as her gaze became still and empty, yet even with violence so fresh,\
  \ the emotions were wan and… <em>dusty</em>, was how he’d described it to Feiya.\
  \ She had immediately agreed, then started down the path that had led to his strange\
  \ new accessory.</p> \n      <p>An integral part of this was her nine-tailed fox’\
  s repeated interviews with a rat. It was of utmost importance, Feiya had said, that\
  \ the rat give the fang of its own free will. Mostly this had meant Lem got to practice\
  \ the flute and forage for mushrooms for a few hours a day, and eventually Daji\
  \ had returned triumphant from his protracted negotiations.</p> \n      <p>Feiya’\
  s “other source” had revealed that, apart from the deceased’s, no flesh or blood\
  \ were present at the killing. Lem had overheard Feiya mumbling in her sleep twice.\
  \ The first time, she had mentioned “the lady’s dark and diaphanous wings,” and\
  \ the second was something about traveling a path of stars. Then Lem shifted in\
  \ his bedroll and saw Daji’s little red eyes peering at him over his pack. Since\
  \ then, he’d done his best to ignore her troubled sleep.</p> \n      <p>Now, here\
  \ they were in some packrat’s palace, searching hatboxes for traces of an invisible\
  \ and apparently unliving force with a particular love for flattened tracheae.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>&nbsp;“Come now, Sad Lem, your tenebrous friend seems to have it all\
  \ well in hand,” Mirror Lem reassured. “Just make sure that little—hey!”</p> \n\
  \      <p>A flash of white flitted behind a neat stack of bones. Muddy pawprints\
  \ led from the ossuary and back to…</p> \n      <p>Real Lem looked down. “I <em>just\
  \ </em>washed my feet! Do you know how long it takes to style my hair?” he groaned.\
  \ “‘Back in a town,’ I thought, ‘do something nice for yourself after weeks of rainy\
  \ roads.’ Should have known.”</p> \n      <p>A vulpine snicker sounded from the\
  \ bones. A pair of red eyes glittered between them, then Daji strolled out into\
  \ sight, nine tails swaying languidly.</p> \n      <p>“But Lem, practice makes perfect.\
  \ Consternation builds character. That is my gift to you—the chance to grow as a\
  \ performer and a person.” The fox knelt, wriggled as if to jump, then paused. “\
  It was both, by the way. They liked ferns, and I liked needling you.”</p> \n   \
  \   <p>Daji launched himself upward with a little yipping laugh, landing both atop\
  \ a bookshelf and above the pincushion Lem had thrown at him. There was a dejected\
  \ <em>pah</em>, <em>pahf</em> as the makeshift missile bounced off the shelf and\
  \ fell to the floor.</p> \n      <br> \n      <center>\n       <hr width=\"75%\"\
  >\n      </center> \n      <br> \n      <p>Feiya snorted in amusement. Daji and\
  \ the affable musician clearly enjoyed their verbal sparring. Truthfully, Lem was\
  \ better company than she was used to. He didn’t ask uncomfortable questions, and\
  \ if she shied away from a topic, he never brought attention to it; he just steered\
  \ clear in future conversations. With him, the shadows of her past weren’t quite\
  \ so deep, and it was easier to tend the cold and righteous fire at her core.</p>\
  \ \n      <p><em>Never to gutter, never to rage, a still and safe anger to burn\
  \ ‘til the day.</em></p> \n      <p>That was why they were here, really. She had\
  \ been tracing a ley line when she stopped in a village for supplies. She’d entered\
  \ the provisioner’s to find a red-jacketed halfling gentleman consoling a weeping\
  \ shopkeeper. Townsfolk were hauling a body out the door and, being a curious sort,\
  \ Feiya asked some questions. Seems the insightfulness of her queries impressed\
  \ Red Jacket and suggested she might be able to help.</p> \n      <p>She was <em>going\
  \ </em>to say no. Then she’d heard a child crying upstairs.</p> \n      <p>Certain\
  \ things could stoke that cold fire until it blazed through her, and no fuel was\
  \ greater than a child’s distress. Her face must have twisted, because Red Jacket\
  \ paused, gave her a curious look, then handed her a torn scrap of the victim’s\
  \ scarf.</p> \n      <p>“What do you make of this?” he’d said. “You know, magically.\
  \ I’m guessing you’ll pick up some of the same things I did.”</p> \n      <p>Then\
  \ he’d quickly closed and opened one eye at her? It was oddly endearing.</p> \n\
  \      <p>Now they were traveling companions, at least until this Crushing Shadow\
  \ was found—assuming Lem didn’t strangle Daji first. She could hear her two companions\
  \ locked in another of their philosophical debates, this one on the relative merits\
  \ of mortal works.</p> \n      <p>Lem was lifting a gleaming sword from its velvet\
  \ cradle. “…Yes, mortal work, and mortals perish. Yes, steel, and steel rusts. But\
  \ the meaning we <em>attach </em>to the steel, to the sword and whatever violence\
  \ it wreaks, that meaning grows tall and wide as wild rose, becomes a vast and tangled\
  \ thing of beauty and danger both.”</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\

  ></a> \n       <p>Lem didn’t think Feiya was listening, but that never stopped him\
  \ from talking all the same. <br> Illustration by Firat Solhan in <em><a href=\"\

  \ \n      </div> \n      <br> \n      <p>“That is one of this great symphony’s mysterious\
  \ movements!” Lem was winding himself up, gazing into the blade’s mirrored surface,\
  \ talking as much to his reflection as to the witch’s familiar. “What may we mortals\
  \ work that outlasts and out grows us? How privileged those few who see how the\
  \ first stone they lay grows into a road, hear their song a continent and a lifetime\
  \ away. Why, it reminds me of…”</p> \n      <p>Daji was weaving toward Feiya between\
  \ the skulls and candlesticks of a high shelf.</p> \n      <p>“I walked away after\
  \ the first sentence.”</p> \n      <p>He hopped down to sit in front of a black\
  \ cloak with a vaguely sinister air, and cocked his head at it.</p> \n      <p>“\
  Smells dangerous.” He nosed the dark fabric, which rippled in a disappointingly\
  \ fabric-like manner. “Alas. Your new friend talks a lot, by the way.”</p> \n  \
  \    <p>“Friend? But yes, he does. I think I like it? It’s comforting. And he makes\
  \ me laugh in a way that feels good.” Feiya chewed on her lip. “<em>You</em> make\
  \ me laugh like a cat who’s not done with their dinner. And that usually feels good,\
  \ too. Mostly.”</p> \n      <p>She walked her finger under Daji’s chin and gave\
  \ him a scratch. He made his <em>I am pleased </em>sound, though he’d never admit\
  \ it. They sat a moment, just the two of them, in the quiet. It was almost like\
  \ those first days, together in the snow.</p> \n      <p>“You’ve come far, little\
  \ one, and she’ll lead you farther still,” purred the fox.</p> \n      <p>&nbsp;“\
  …Why is it quiet?”</p> \n      <p>Feiya turned to see the cloak strangling Lem.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>It was wrapped around his neck, a sooty version of that eight-legged\
  \ fish he’d been trying to explain to her the other day, and he was scrabbling at\
  \ it to no avail.</p> \n      <p>She reached into herself for the cold anger that\
  \ was always there. In her mind's eye it rose from the depths, trailing mist, and\
  \ curled into long and wicked needles to jab into the minds of those who had wronged\
  \ her. She snarled, and an invisible fang streaked toward the belligerent garment.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>It ricocheted harmlessly off the utter void where the thing’s intent\
  \ would have been, if it were a thinking, feeling creature.</p> \n      <p>“Daji!”\
  \ She yelped, and her familiar responded with his own hungry growl.</p> \n     \
  \ <br> \n      <center>\n       <hr width=\"75%\">\n      </center> \n      <br>\
  \ \n      <p><em>Woe, woe, for the snuffing of a short-burned flame, the flower\
  \ plucked before it blooms.</em></p> \n      <p>Red and black flames licked slowly\
  \ at the edges of Lem’s darkening vision.</p> \n      <p><em>Enough, Sad Lem. Ideas?\
  \ </em></p> \n      <p><em>Not a one! Oh, but I think </em>he <em>has some.</em></p>\
  \ \n      <p>Daji was crouched on some taxidermized creature, his nine tails waving\
  \ slowly back and forth, that bright red coloration crawling across his fur. His\
  \ eyes glimmered bright as dying stars.</p> \n      <p><em>“A creature in sharp\
  \ artifice will gnaw a limb to aid its flight</em>,” said the fox, words smoldering\
  \ and spreading. “<em>A last gasp caught twixt death and life can tear as tender\
  \ as a saw</em>.”</p> \n      <p>One of Lem’s ragged breaths splintered, somehow,\
  \ and then each splinter spread knife-like wings to launch itself at the cloak twisted\
  \ about his neck. It writhed as the magic tore through stitch and seam. Fabric turned\
  \ rotten and brittle, and the tightness around his neck eased.</p> \n      <p>The\
  \ thin trickle of air into his lungs was all it took. The curiosity, the wonder,\
  \ the desire to <em>live </em>and <em>find out</em> rose from his throat. He fumbled\
  \ with numbing fingers, but his flute was unreachable. Still, he wasn’t without\
  \ tools.</p> \n      <p>A single clear note sounded from his pursed lips. It shimmered\
  \ against the ear, brittle, a raindrop brimming with the vast waters of mortal emotion\
  \ and experience. Even standing as he was in death’s threshold, he marveled at how\
  \ the smallest part of something could reflect the beauty of the whole—</p> \n \
  \     <p><em>echo of malice pale stitched heart wounds reflection of</em> right\
  \ <em>that’s </em>it—<br><br>“Feiya!” he rasped. “Not possessed, an echo! Recall\
  \ the sound, remember your—” He stopped, unable to name the thing he had seen in\
  \ her eyes that first day. He’d carried it himself, once.</p> \n      <p>But as\
  \ the note faded, Lem saw the realization spread across her face. She stepped forward,\
  \ lifted one cool, sharp claw—she had <em>claws</em>?—in front of his face, then\
  \ sliced it downward. The tip bit into the writhing fabric of the cloak.</p> \n\
  \      <p>His bicep went cold, and that little yellow fang on the sinew thong ripped\
  \ its way through his shirt. It, too, splintered, and suddenly he was surrounded\
  \ by whizzing shards of bone, all tearing through gaps left by Daji’s spell. Between\
  \ the talisman, the magic, and Feiya’s claws, the malicious thing was nothing more\
  \ than gray tatters, some silver, and a few rapidly darkening red gems.</p> \n \
  \     <p>Lem slumped to the floor and took in a ragged breath.</p> \n      <p>“\
  Maybe ‘all in due time’ could happen a bit sooner?” The gleam of candleflame across\
  \ dully metallic nails caught his eye. “And since when did you get so <em>pointy</em>?”\
  </p> \n      <p>“I’m not certain. It’s been a while.” Feiya lifted her hand to watch\
  \ her nails lighten and retract. “Thank you for that final piece of the puzzle.\
  \ I thought it was possession, but when you said to… you know.”</p> \n      <p>“\
  Yes.” Lem’s bushy eyebrows scrunched together. “Feiya, I can only guess at what’\
  s happened, and I truly don’t mean to pry, but with the strangling…”</p> \n    \
  \  <p>A newly lengthened nail pressed against his lips, but Feiya’s expression was\
  \ calm.</p> \n      <p>“It’s alright. Thank you,” she whispered, smiling slightly,\
  \ “friend. Now, we should probably leave before—”</p> \n      <p>A shadow fell across\
  \ the shop door’s stained-glass window. The key turned in the lock with the smoothness\
  \ of an old habit, and a stout man stepped into the building. One look, and his\
  \ face was rapidly darkening with anger.</p> \n      <p>“<em>Mmm</em>,” mused Lem,\
  \ surrounded by shredded garments, bone fragments, and broken glass. “Bit late for\
  \ that.”</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p style=\"font-weight: bold; line-height:\
