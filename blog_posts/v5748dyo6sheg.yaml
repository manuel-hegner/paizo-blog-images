  description\">A little over six months ago, I joined the Paizo team as the new (and\
  \ first!) Organized Play Associate. Those six months have been an <em>adventure</em>.\
  \ I had a total of eight days in the office before I was suddenly working from home\
  \ in a different timezone. We went from discussing floor plans for the Sagamore\
  \ to scrambling to put together our first completely online convention. My poor\
  \ dice sit neglected in their bag as macros have replaced them (alright, not really,\
  \ I take them out regularly, I can’t bear to let them sit unrolled).</p> \n    \
  \ <br clear=\"all\"> \n     <p>That paints a bleak picture. Let me brighten it up!\
  \ I’ve seen how resilient our community can be, as we moved online and kept playing\
  \ at full force. I’ve seen how hard our Online Region venture-officers worked to\
  \ welcome the entire world into their realm. I’ve witnessed the passion our players\
  \ have for our products, passion matched only by the people I work with. Tonya has\
  \ taken a vacation, which hasn’t happened in far too long, and is also the reason\
  \ I get to take over this space for the month!</p> \n     <p>I will be very honest:\
  \ I love my job. I love coming to work each day and helping to support some talented\
  \ creatives. I love working with the volunteers and the players, all of them, even\
  \ you. I think it’s important to remember that gaming is at the heart of what we\
  \ do. Games are meant to be fun, and we’re all playing this one together. I’m having\
  \ fun! Let’s keep it going.</p> \n     <h2>Sanctioning</h2> \n     <p>While no new\
  \ hardcover books came out this month, <em>Lost Omens Pathfinder Society Guide</em>\
  \ comes out on October 14! We hope you’re all looking forward to it, and we’re aiming\
  \ to have it sanctioned as soon as possible, ideally on Oct 15th! To let you all\
  \ We’ll post a blog as well as update the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh3j?Pathfinder-Society-Character-Options\"\
  >Character Options blog</a>.</p> \n     <p>By month’s end, we aim to have sanctioning\
  \ posted for <em>Extinction Curse</em> and the remainder of <em>The Threefold Conspiracy</em>.\
  \ We’ll post a blog when we add them to the website, so keep an eye out on Thursdays!\
  \ The team is also currently working through <em>Tyrant’s Grasp</em> and will begin\
  \ to look at the still unsanctioned APs in the coming weeks.</p> \n     <h2>Chronicle\
  \ Boons</h2> \n     <p>Many of you have noticed that there are now Chronicle Boons\
  \ available on the Boons tab of My Organized Play. These Chronicle Boons will replace\
  \ the boons on the Chronicle sheets you’re used to. They have no cost and can be\
  \ purchased for any character who qualifies.</p> \n     <p>If you already have a\
  \ boon from Season 1 on your chronicle sheet, you don’t need to purchase it again\
  \ online, though you certainly can if you like! Season 2 scenarios will only list\
  \ boons online, so those boons, such as the boon for <em>PFS 2-00: The King in Thorns</em>,\
  \ will need to be purchased. </p>\n     <p>There is currently a bug where characters\
  \ with GM credit do not qualify for a scenario’s chronicle boon; we have sent this\
  \ to tech and are hopeful for a fix very soon. Other feature requests we’ve made\
  \ include the ability to hide boons that a character does not qualify for, or which\
  \ they have already purchased.</p> \n     <h2>Guides</h2> \n     <p>Last week, we\
  \ released the new Guide to Organized Play: Pathfinder Society (second edition)\
  \ on the Organized Play Foundation’s website. This is a complete update and overhaul.\
  \ Many sections were trimmed or outright removed, and a number of upgrades were\
  \ made for ease of use. We discussed some of the changes in <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shdu?Organized-Play-Initiative-Digitization\"\
  >our recent blog about our goals for the future</a>, and later today we'll be publishing\
  \ a blog discussing how to bring your characters in compliance with the new rules.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Our goal is to continue refining the Guide in the coming weeks, based\
  \ on community feedback. Once the text is finalized, the OPF will create a PDF version\
  \ for download.</p> \n     <h2>Stars/Novas/Glyphs</h2> \n     <p>Several GMs received\
  \ their fifth star in the last month. Doing so indicates a commitment to Organized\
  \ Play, as to achieve this milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least\
  \ 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios, as well as run a game for\
  \ a venture-captain. A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach five stars\
  \ is 650 hours!</p> \n     <p>Congratulations to:<br> <b>Patrick Berndt<br> RC Craigo<br>\
  \ Melvin Ngo</b></p> \n     <p>For Novas and Glyphs, the online evaluation system\
  \ is active and GMs should confirm their observer entered their evaluation into\
  \ the system.</p> \n     <h2>Convention Listing</h2> \n     <p>If you don’t see\
  \ a convention on the list that you think should be there, contact the event organizer\
  \ and ask them to register their event for Organized Play support!</p> \n     <table\
