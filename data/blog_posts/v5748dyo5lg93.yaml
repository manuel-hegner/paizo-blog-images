  >The arcanist was one of the more difficult classes to design in the <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy95d1\"><i>Advanced Class Guide</i></a>. When the idea first came together,\
  \ it was based almost entirely upon mechanics. As an arcane caster that can prepare\
  \ spells like a wizard, but cast them like a sorcerer, the idea was an interesting\
  \ one, but when we presented it in the first round of the playtest the deficiency\
  \ became clear. What is an arcanist?</span></p> \n     <p>As the playtest rolled\
  \ on, this problem became more and more clear. The class had an interesting basic\
  \ mechanic, but it needed a story hook and mechanics to support that idea. It was\
  \ clear that we needed to go back to the drawing board. Looking at the wizard as\
  \ the arcane caster that learns through study and the sorcerer who masters magic\
  \ by drawing upon the power in his blood, the arcanist needed to fall somewhere\
  \ between the two.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb360\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PZO1129-ArcanistOccultist.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PZO1129-ArcanistOccultist_360.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \      <br>Illustration by Subroto Bhaumik\n     </div> \n     <p>Ultimately, we\
  \ decided on making the arcanist about tinkering with the underlying forces of arcane\
  \ magic, using a combination of study and innate talent to break magic down and\
  \ shape it to fit her needs. Combining that concept with an arcane reservoir, a\
  \ pool of power that the arcanist can use to fuel exploits that break the rules\
  \ of magic, the class really started to come together. In the second draft of the\
  \ playtest, we knew we were on the right track. Most playtesters were concerned\
  \ about power balance, but the overall consensus was that the changes we made gave\
  \ the class a place in the game all its own.</p> \n     <p>While the final version\
  \ of the class is very close to the second playtest version, the big changes came\
  \ to the arcane exploits (like all of the exploits that dealt energy damage got\
  \ a boost). These abilities are what make the arcanist unique and in the final version\
  \ we added a large number of them to the class, giving you a wider variety of character\
  \ types you can build with the class. Take a look!</p> \n     <blockquote> \n  \
  \    <p><i>Energy Shield (Su):</i> The arcanist can protect herself from energy\
  \ damage as a standard action by expending 1 point from her arcane reservoir. She\
  \ must pick one energy type and gains resistance 10 against that energy type for\
  \ 1 minute per arcanist level. This protection increases by 5 for every 5 levels\
  \ the arcanist possesses (up to a maximum of 30 at 20th level).</p> \n      <p><i>Quick\
  \ Study (Ex):</i> The arcanist can prepare a spell in place of an existing spell\
  \ by expending 1 point from her arcane reservoir. Using this ability is a full-round\
  \ action that provokes an attack of opportunity. The arcanist must be able to reference\
  \ her spellbook when using this ability. The spell prepared must be of the same\
  \ level as the spell being replaced.</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>In addition,\
  \ we added a number of greater exploits to the class as well, adding powerful tool\
  \ to the high level arcanist.</p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p><i>Suffering Knowledge\
  \ (Su):</i> The arcanist can learn to cast a spell by suffering from its effects.\
  \ When the arcanist fails a saving throw against a spell cast by an enemy, as an\
  \ immediate action she can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir to temporarily\
  \ acquire the spell. She can cast the spell using her spell slots as if it was a\
  \ spell she had prepared that day. The spell must be on the sorcerer/wizard spell\
  \ list and must be of a level that she can cast. The ability to cast this spell\
  \ remains for a number of rounds equal to the arcanistâ€™s Charisma modifier (minimum\
  \ 1).</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>Of course, the <a href=\"/products/btpy95d1\"\
  ><i>Advanced Class Guide</i></a> also features a number of fun new archetypes to\
  \ use with the arcanist. There is the blade adept, who gains a sentient sword and\
  \ select a limited number of magus arcana instead of arcane exploits. You can also\
  \ play a brown-fur transmuter, whose reservoir can be used to bolster the power\
  \ of her transmutation spells. The eldritch font gains more spell slots, but can\
  \ prepare fewer spells per day. An elemental master focuses her power on just one\
  \ element, but to much greater effect. While there are a number of other archetypes\
  \ for the arcanist, there is one more that needs to be called out. The white mage\
  \ can expend points from her arcane reservoir to allow her to cast cure spells with\
  \ her spell slots, but at higher levels she can even cast <i>breath of life</i>.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Well that about wraps up the preview for this week. Check back in next\
  \ week for songs of bravery and rage!</p> \n     <p>Jason Bulmahn<br> <i>Lead Designer</i></p>\
