  \ </div> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Hello, all! It’\
  s your friendly neighborhood Pathfinder Adventure Card Game venture-captain again!\
  \ Today, I want to tell you about an exciting new development for PACG online play:\
  \ we can now play in two different “virtual tabletop” formats: Tabletop Simulator\
  \ (a paid app for playing a variety of card and board games online) and a free-to-use,\
  \ custom-built interface at <a href=\"http://acg.orgplayonline.com\" target=\"_blank\"\
  >acg.orgplayonline.com</a>!</p> \n      <p>Paizo does not receive any revenue from\
  \ these options, so we’re asking that at least one person at the virtual table own\
  \ physical copies of the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01ws7?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Core-Set\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Adventure Card Game Core Set</em></a> and the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01ws8?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Curse-of-the-Crimson-Throne-Adventure-Path\"\
  ><em>Curse of the Crimson Throne Adventure Path</em></a>.</p> \n      <h3>Tabletop\
  \ Simulator</h3> \n      <p>First, let’s discuss Tabletop Simulator. I’d like to\
  \ start by noting that Paizo has not made any agreements with Berserk Games, the\
  \ creators of Tabletop Simulator. What they HAVE done is given the online VO corps\
  \ permission to direct players to Tabletop Simulator as a viable social distancing-approved\
  \ alternative to playing the card game in person. In order to play, you’ll need\
  \ to <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/286160/Tabletop_Simulator/\">download\
  \ Tabletop Simulator</a> from the Steam games library—a license for Tabletop Simulator\
  \ goes for about $20 USD—then visit <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/browse/?appid=286160\"\
  >the Workshop page</a>. </p> \n      <p>There have been other implementations of\
  \ the PACG posted on the Workshop in the past, such as the highly scripted version\
  \ created by Steam user waterfoul, and I would recommend you check out several to\
  \ determine which you prefer. However, the one I’m going to point you to today is\
  \ one that I have built out over the past few months, appropriately titled <a href=\"\
  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2068179987\" target=\"_blank\"\
  >Pathfinder Adventure Card Society (Sanctioned Implementation)</a>. </p> \n    \
  \  <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/050620_InitialLoad.png\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"60%\" src=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/050620_InitialLoad.png\"\
  \ alt=\"\"></a>\n       <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\">The table is neat and tidy,\
  \ for the moment…</p>\n      </div> \n      <p>This implementation has very little\
  \ scripted functionality built in. The functions it has are meant to make it easier\
  \ to deal with things like building decks and cleaning up the game at the end of\
  \ a scenario. It includes all the cards from the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01ws7\"\
  ><em>Core Set</em></a> and <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01ws8?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Curse-of-the-Crimson-Throne-Adventure-Path\"\
  ><em>Curse of the Crimson Throne</em></a>, the standalone adventure <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq021w2?PACS-Standalone-Adventure-1-A-Night-at-Bloodthorne-Manor\"\
  ><em>A Night at Bloodthorne Manor</em></a>, and the Adventurer’s Packs that were\
  \ described on a <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh3k&amp;page=2?Introducing-Adventurer-s-Packs-for-the\"\
  >blog a few months ago</a> with which to build out your character’s deck.</p> \n\
  \      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/050620_AdventurersPack.png\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"60%\" src=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/050620_AdventurersPack.png\"\
  \ alt=\"Adventurers packs\"></a>\n       <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\">So many choices!\
  \ How can I choose just three packs?</p>\n      </div> \n      <p>I have created\
  \ a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m1xr4oY_OtJInFi2GLuOuzDnXlkzEubU9ggd9TjAZVA/edit?usp=sharing\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Google doc with lots of instructions</a> on how to get started,\
  \ so I won’t get into all that here. Instead, I’ll show a few screenshots of what\
  \ you’ll see in-game, and discuss a few useful features—as well as a few important\
  \ limitations—of playing in this format.</p> \n      <p><b>Useful Features:</b></p>\
  \ \n      <ul> \n       <li><b>Location setup is quick.</b> Once you place your\
  \ locations on the board, just click the Build Locations button, and the game will\
  \ pull random cards from the vault (the piles on the left of the game board) in\
  \ the right numbers based on the location size you specify.</li> \n       <li><b>Rolling\
  \ dice is intuitive.</b> No need to write up macros or learn some complicated dice-rolling\
  \ language. There are infinite bags of each type of standard dice along the top\
  \ of the table. Grab a set for yourself. When you’re ready to roll them, I recommend\
  \ highlighting all the dice before you toss them (by clicking and dragging a box\
  \ around them). Pick them all up and toss them (lightly) across the table, and let\
  \ the game’s physics engine do the work for you! If you highlighted the dice, after\
  \ the roll, you can just mouse over any of the dice and the game will tell you the\
  \ total! You can also just highlight dice and hit the ‘r’ button, but I’ll admit\
  \ it’s not quite as satisfying as tossing the dice a bit.</li> \n       <li><b>It’\
  s easy to upgrade and save your character.</b> When you finish a scenario and are\
  \ ready to use one of your hero points for a feat on your character card, all you\
  \ have to do is open the Decals menu (it’s a button along the left side of the screen\
  \ that looks like a square stamper with a handle), choose the checkmark stamp, and\
  \ drop it right onto your character card. If you make a mistake, just click the\
  \ stamp you placed again with the Decal tool, and it will disappear and you can\
  \ try again.</li> \n       <li><b>Cleanup at the end of the scenario is quick.</b>\
  \ Once players have chosen any deck upgrades they want, just drop any unused cards\
  \ onto the game board and click Clean Up Board. The game will sort all the cards\
  \ back into the correct decks in the vault.</li> \n      </ul> \n      <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/050620_ThreeButtons.png\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"60%\" src=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/050620_ThreeButtons.png\"\
  \ alt=\"Three Buttons\"></a>\n       <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\">The three colored\
  \ buttons (Build Hourglass, Build Locations, and Clean Up Board) make life so much\
  \ easier.</p>\n      </div> \n      <p><b>Challenges:</b></p> \n      <ul> \n  \
  \     <li><b>Only the newest cards are available.</b> At the moment, we haven’t\
  \ imported any of the older Adventure Path boxes (such as Rise of the Runelords\
  \ or Skull and Shackles), so you’re limited to scenarios that use the <em>Core Set</em>\
  \ and <em>Curse of the Crimson Throne</em> cards. However, there are a lot of scenarios\
  \ for just those sets, including the storybooks that come with those boxes, <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/store/pacg/pacs/year6\">Pathfinder Adventure Card Society season\
  \ 6</a>, the standalone adventure <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq021w2?PACS-Standalone-Adventure-1-A-Night-at-Bloodthorne-Manor\"\
  ><em>A Night at Bloodthorne Manor</em></a>, and the short goblin-themed adventure\
  \ <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01zpg?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-We-Be-Heroes\"\
  ><em>We Be Heroes</em></a>? So don’t worry about running out of options too quickly!</li>\
  \ \n       <li><b>Finding a game can be difficult.</b> There are a few different\
  \ ways for players to join a game that you’re hosting, but sometimes they’re not\
  \ incredibly intuitive. When you create a multiplayer table, make sure to give it\
  \ a descriptive name AND a password. Players can use the Join button to find your\
  \ game and join it. You can also invite players to your game’s lobby through the\
  \ Steam Friends interface, but they will still need to know the password for your\
  \ game.</li> \n       <li><b>You can’t easily import an existing character</b>.\
  \ At the moment, there’s no easy way to pull in an existing character deck, so if\
  \ you’re playing with a new box runner, be sure to have your full deck list ready\
  \ before the game starts so that you can quickly build your deck from the cards\
  \ in the supply (along the left side of the table). You’ll also need to check off\
  \ any feats that your character already possesses.</li> \n       <li><b>It’s easy\
  \ to mess things up</b>. Because the scripting that I’ve built is so light, it also\
  \ means there is very little error checking. For example, if you click Build Locations\
  \ twice, the game doesn’t know that you already built the locations, so you get\
  \ double the number of cards you’re supposed to have in each location. Please be\
  \ cautious when using features like these.</li> \n      </ul> \n      <p>Please\
  \ try out the Tabletop Simulator implementation if it interests you. You can email\
  \ suggestions, bug reports, or other feedback to me at <a href=\"mailto:cartmanbeck@orgplayonline.com\"\
  >cartmanbeck@orgplayonline.com</a>.</p> \n      <h3><a href=\"http://acg.orgplayonline.com\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">acg.orgplayonline.com</a></h3> \n      <p>Next up is a free\
  \ interface that was originally built to play using play-by-post on the forums;\
  \ it has recently been upgraded to be more useful for real-time gaming. If you’\
  re not yet familiar with <a href=\"http://acg.orgplayonline.com\">acg.orgplayonline.com</a>,\
  \ go check it out, make yourself an account, and create a character profile. </p>\
  \ \n      <p>This interface is less of a virtual tabletop in that it doesn’t use\
  \ any visual representations of cards. Instead, sections of the webpage provide\
  \ all the needed information for a scenario, and then information on each location\
  \ that’s been added to the table. In order for a player to explore the next card\
  \ in a location for their character, they would click on the little “binoculars”\
  \ button on that location to bring up a modal box showing the text of the top card.\
  \ There are options to acquire, banish, or move cards. The best thing about this\
  \ interface is that it costs players and box runners nothing to use (though we still\
  \ expect at least one person at the table to own the <em>Core Set</em> and <em>Curse\
  \ of the Crimson Throne</em>)!</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a\
  \ href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/050620_InfoScreen.jpg\" target=\"\

  \ alt=\"Main info screen\"></a>\n       <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\">This is where\
  \ the magic happens.</p>\n      </div> \n      <p><b>Useful Features: </b></p> \n\
  \      <ul> \n       <li><b>Automatic location building</b>. Like the Tabletop Simulator\
  \ implementation, once you’ve set up the game and added the needed locations, it’\
  s a single click to build them all out: just go to Game Setup → Build Locations,\
  \ and the site will find the correct cards from our database and add them to the\
  \ locations.</li> \n       <li><b>Access to any card</b>. Unlike Tabletop Simulator,\
  \ the database that this site was built around includes essentially every card ever\
  \ created for PACG. This means you can run games from <em>any</em> Adventure Path\
  \ box and <em>any</em> PACS season!</li> \n       <li><b>Realtime and asynchronous\
  \ play options</b>. In Tabletop Simulator, the box runner is hosting the game’s\
  \ table in real time, so if the host isn’t present, the game isn’t either. Here,\
  \ everything happening is held in a dedicated database, so players can jump in and\
  \ take a turn whenever it’s convenient for them. If your group has trouble finding\
  \ a single multi-hour stretch to all be online, you can run your game over multiple\
  \ days, using a text-based messaging system like Discord or Slack to let players\
  \ know when it’s their turn. </li> \n      </ul> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ alt=\"\"></a>\n       <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\">This is from a play-by-post\
  \ game I’ve been running for about a month. Great players!</p>\n      </div> \n\
  \      <p><b>Challenges:</b></p> \n      <ul> \n       <li><b>Clunky interface</b>.\
  \ As the person who wrote most of the code for this site, I am the first to admit\
  \ that I am not a professional software engineer. (We do now have one working on\
  \ the site, and he has made <em>incredible</em> improvements to it in just a few\
  \ months!) The site isn’t well-suited to a phone-size screen, and hitting the wrong\
  \ button can cause major problems. For these reasons, I recommend that you leave\
  \ any functions other than examining and exploring cards on your own turn to the\
  \ box runner. Bug reports can be submitted to <a href=\"mailto:acgbugs@orgplayonline.com\"\
  >acgbugs@orgplayonline.com</a>. </li> \n       <li><b>No character deck tracking</b>.\
  \ Though we hope to add it eventually, at the moment players must keep track of\
  \ their character decks through some other method. (Using your own physical cards\
  \ are an option, of course; you can also try a community-built Google Sheets character\
  \ tracker built by several community members—<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y7xuo7gfAtykLJSI1jDsFi86Y1DiiOSOafZrvJWX560/edit?usp=sharing\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">here’s one of the most recent versions</a>; many players have\
  \ made their own <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1arWgvvnnRztmPqSwtYGpIcnMwgy5gF0ARY2ggR7qIpU/edit?usp=sharing\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">modifications/versions of it</a>. There are detailed instructions\
  \ on how to use sheets like this on the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/campaigns/PFSACGFlaxseedOnDeckAdventureCardGuildLodge\"\
  >Flaxseed On Deck Play-by-Post Lodge page</a>.)</li> \n      </ul> \n      <p>That’\
  s a lot of information for one blog. PaizoCon Online is going to test these systems\
  \ in ways that they’ve never been tested before, so there will be some growing pains.\
  \ I hope you can see, however, the hard work and love that the VO corps have put\
  \ into making this game as enjoyable an experience online as it is in real life,\
  \ and I look forward to seeing all of you signed up for games at <a href=\"https://paizo.com/paizocon\"\
