  \ \n     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">It’s been a few months\
  \ since we last checked on our adventurous friends in the town of Otari, but you\
  \ can now get the entire Shroud of Four Silences novella in eBook form <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/products/btq027rw?Pathfinder-The-Shroud-of-Four-Silences-ePub\"\
  >here on paizo.com</a> or on the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0916R3VTN\"\
  >Kindle bookstore</a>. Next, we’ll look at the pyromaniac scamp, Gristleburst, wrapping\
  \ up our No-Prep Character series based on the novella’s main adventuring party.\
  \ What would you like to see next in the world of Pathfinder (or Starfinder) fiction?\
  \ Do you prefer blog-based flash fiction, email-based serialized novellas, or something\
  \ else entirely? Let us know in the comments below. </p> \n      <h3>Wendlyn, Incorrigible\
  \ Thief</h3> \n      <p>Wendlyn grew up in Otari and knows just about everyone in\
  \ it. This means she knows which people are safe to target with her petty larceny.\
  \ She’s been on the wrong side of Captain Longsaddle of the Otari town guard for\
  \ as long as she can remember, but she keeps away from the sorts of crimes that\
  \ would call for serious punishment, or that would seriously hurt anyone. The people\
  \ of Otari are immune to her thefts but not her pranks; she’s fond of hiding animals\
  \ where they’ll surprise people or livening up a celebration with some unexpected\
  \ fireworks. She considers it to be all in good fun. Captain Longsaddle would definitely\
  \ disagree, as would her younger half-sister, the pious acolyte <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shk1?NoPrep-Character-Lisavet\"\
  >Lisavet</a>.</p> \n      <p>Wendlyn is an excellent person to become acquainted\
  \ with in Otari, as she knows a fair share of the town’s secrets. Her lifelong inclination\
  \ toward theft also makes her just the right person to disable a tricky lock or\
  \ disarm a complicated trap. She’s eager to join just about any escapade, illicit\
  \ or otherwise, as long as no one seems likely to get seriously hurt.</p> <a href=\"\

  \ \n      <p>Game Masters might consider the following plot hooks as a means of\
  \ integrating Wendlyn into any Pathfinder Second Edition game.</p> \n      <ul>\
  \ \n       <li>Wendlyn needs the heroes to help her recover a hand mirror she stole\
  \ from an abandoned house and then fenced, as she didn’t realize its presence was\
  \ keeping a ghost confined to the old house. She hopes to recover the mirror from\
  \ the fence and get it back into the house before anyone’s hurt.</li> \n       <li>One\
  \ of the heroes is an alibi who can prove Wendlyn wasn’t at the scene of a crime\
  \ that Captain Longsaddle is certain she committed. The heroes must work to prove\
  \ the thief’s innocence—in this particular matter, at least.</li> \n       <li>The\
  \ heroes have come across a strange puzzle box that defies all attempts to open\
  \ it, but an expert locksmith like Wendlyn might be able to help.</li> \n      \
  \ <li>Through her shady contacts, Wendlyn has heard of a plot to smuggle drugs into\
  \ Otari’s harbor late at night. She hopes to intercept the smugglers, dump the drugs\
  \ into the harbor’s waters, and teach the smugglers to stay out of her town.</li>\
