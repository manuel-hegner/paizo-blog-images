  artist: "playtesting the adventure he's writing for the upcoming Pathfinder Module,\
    \ Crypt of the Everflame. Check out this thread on our messageboards for the gory\
    \ details! I'm playing Merisiel in this one, and I haven't quite decided yet if\
    \ I'm gonna do a big detailed journal yetâ€”I'm not sure Merisiel's the type to\
    \ keep a diary. Maybe a kill list, though. Maybe even a \"still needs to be killed\"\
    \ list. Hmmmmm... James Jacobs Pathfinder Editor-in-Chief"
