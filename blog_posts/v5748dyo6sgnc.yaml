  \ itemprop=\"description\">This is the month. Let's move past the endings of games\
  \ and decisions on who's sitting on what thrones, as this month is the climax of\
  \ Starfinder Society's (slightly extended) inaugural season. Today we're going to\
  \ review the two scenarios that make up the ending our first season and set-up Starfinder\
  \ Society going into an upcoming interactive special and its next season of play!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Paizo's own \"live editor extreme!!!!\" (as Zo! would say), Lyz Liddell,\
  \ brings us an emotionally touching tale of adventure and intrigue in <a href=\"\
  /products/btq01x4y?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-138-The-Many-Minds-of-Historia\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society #1-38: The Many Minds of Historia</em></a>. You may remember\
  \ Lyz and her work from <a href=\"/products/btpy9wet?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-105-The-First-Mandate\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society #1-05: The First Mandate</em></a>, where she kicked off\
  \ a lot of the ongoing Scoured Stars storyline. This Tier 5–8 scenario advances\
  \ the storyline of two fan-favorite factions: the Dataphiles and the Exo-Guardians.\
  \ It's hard to go into detail about this scenario without providing some significant\
  \ spoilers, but I'll just say that if you're a member of either faction, this scenario\
  \ is going to drastically influence how your faction plays out in the future. Suffice\
  \ it to say, if you've been interested in <a href=\"/products/btpy9zjx?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-114-Star-Sugar-Heartlove\"\
  >certain popular events</a> in the setting, or some other <a href=\"/products/btq01wlk?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-133-Data-Breach\"\
  >recent events</a>, this scenario should be a stunning capstone adventure!</p> \n\

  \ have the author of <a href=\"/products/btpya08y?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-1-99-The-Scoured-Stars-Invasion\"\
  >last year's major interactive event</a>, veteran freelancer Mikko Kallio, bringing\
  \ us the momentous conclusion to our first season in <a href=\"/products/btq01x4z?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-139-The-Heralds-War\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society #1-39: The Herald's War</em></a>. Developing—no, just reading—\
  this Tier 7–10 scenario was a pure joy from my perspective as the season's architect\
  \ (along with a ton of insight from John Compton and the rest of the Organized Play\
  \ team). Bringing together a figurative ton worth of elements (enough to make a\
  \ sidebar wheeze) throughout Starfinder Society's first season, this adventure really\
  \ shines as the culmination of a story that's been told over the past 20 months.\
  \ From a climactic space battle to squaring off against the most significant threat\
  \ we've seen in an adventure so far, this scenario really sets the tone for what\
  \ immediately follows—more on that event in the coming weeks!</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  ></a> \n     <p>Illustration by Bryan Syme</p>\n    </div> \n    <p>With that, Starfinder\
  \ Year 1 is complete, and we have our upcoming <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgks?Starfinder-Society-Year-2\"\
  >Year of a Thousand Bites</a> to look forward to (nothing ominous there). I can't\
  \ wait to see everyone who can make it out to PaizoCon this week, where the Organized\
  \ Play team and I will reveal some new tidbits in our Starfinder Society panel!\
  \ Also, attendees get a chance at playing the two previewed scenarios just a bit\
  \ early, as they won't be available until the 29th of May.</p> \n    <p>As a final\
  \ note on these two releases, I'd just like to say that more than any other scenarios,\
  \ some Major events occur within these adventures. I'd like to ask our awesome community\
  \ to keep these events under wraps—well, under spoiler tags—for the coming weeks,\
  \ as I think some players want to experience these changes without knowing what's\
  \ coming.</p> \n    <p>If you didn't see them already, consider taking a peek at\
  \ the <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgnb?PaizoCon-2019-Pathfinder-Society-Scenarios\"\
