  \ \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Keith here, to talk about something pretty darn\
  \ shiny that we've added to the game. At the end of the day, we all like toys. And\
  \ I'll admit that sometimes I've wanted to get them faster than the game has offered\
  \ them. For instance, I love power feats, so waiting to win 10 scenarios in <em>Wrath\
  \ of the Righteous</em> to get my first was frustrating.</p> \n    <p>No more.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>We've been hinting for a while that we did something fun with the backs\
  \ of all of those markers we added to the game. Time to spill the beans: The <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btq01ws7?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Core-Set\"><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Adventure Card Game: Core Set</em></a> introduces a new game mechanic and resource\
  \ called hero points. They do a whole lot of fun things.</p> \n    <p>First, when\
  \ you are rewarded with a hero point, you can immediately spend it to gain a card,\
  \ power, or skill feat—your choice. Now, you can take those feats in whatever order\
  \ is best for your character and your group. Just got a fantastic loot card? Maybe\
  \ a card feat is in order. Botched a vital roll by 1 and it's bothering you? Skill\
  \ feat. Or take one of those sweet power feats to spice things up a bit. This new\
  \ reward system increases your ability to decide how your character develops, but\
  \ it does have limitations to keep things from flying entirely out of control: the\
  \ number of feats you can have of each type is limited to the # of the adventure\
  \ you're playing. So while you're playing adventure 2, you can gain up to 2 skill\
  \ feats, 2 power feats, and 2 card feats.</p> \n    <p>So what do you do with your\
  \ hero points when you're not buying a feat? Use them to be heroic! Or at least\
  \ luckier. During a scenario, you can spend a hero point to reroll all the dice\
  \ on your check. Just missed on your check to defeat the villain, and failing it\
  \ will mean you fail the scenario, or perhaps even die? Or maybe you've found that\
  \ fantastic boon you've been chasing, and you botched the check to acquire. You'll\
  \ be glad to have a spare hero point for a reroll.</p> \n    <p>You might also want\
  \ to keep a hero point on hand for their most powerful use: If you die during a\
  \ scenario, spend all your remaining hero points at the end, and you're no longer\
  \ dead. This provides a reasonable compromise between those who feel death should\
  \ never be permanent (always have at least one hero point on hand!) and those who\
  \ think it should always be permanent (spend those hero points on rerolls, so you're\
  \ not going down without a fight). Death still packs enough of a punch to add consequence\
  \ to your choices, but not so much that a risky decision or moment of bad luck might\
  \ derail your entire Adventure Path.</p> \n    <p>The number of hero points you\
  \ collect varies by Adventure Path, giving each a different feel. The Dragon's Demand\
  \ gives you just enough that dying too much will eat into feats, so play carefully.\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btq01ws8?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Curse-of-the-Crimson-Throne-Adventure-Path\"\
  ><em>Curse of the Crimson Throne</em></a> thinks you might need some of those rerolls,\
  \ so it gives out a few more hero points.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\

  \ alt=\"\"></a> \n     <p>Sometimes a reroll is handy. And sometimes failure is\
  \ not an option.</p> \n    </div> \n    <p>Starting at <a href=\"/paizocon\">PaizoCon</a>,\
  \ the freshly renamed <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgjj?Introducing-the-Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Society\"\
  >Pathfinder Adventure Card Society</a> replaces die bumps with hero points, and\
  \ greatly simplifies its schedule for taking feats: every new scenario you complete\
  \ gives you a hero point. This also helps cover for the occasionally missed scenario\
  \ or <a href=\"/threads/rzs2t6k2?HawkCon-II-The-Wrath-Continues\">mishap that might\
  \ arise from playing with strangers at conventions</a>.</p> \n    <p>Since we're\
  \ talking a bit about feats, let's talk about roles. Remember when I said I get\
  \ frustrated waiting for power feats? I also get impatient waiting for role cards.\
  \ And I'm not alone. There are many discussions around which order to take power\
  \ feats on a character before you get your role, because you generally have to take\
  \ almost all of them, and you have to play for probably more than half your character's\
  \ career before you open up more options with your role.</p> \n    <p>No more.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>(Okay, so that seemed less dramatic the second time. Well, anyway‚ After\
  \ extensive testing and gathering opinions, we've moved roles to show up a bit earlier.\
  \ In Dragon's Demand, you gain your role as the reward for adventure 2, and Crimson\
  \ Throne gives out roles after the first scenario of adventure 3. And the new Pathfinder\
  \ Adventure Card Society reward structure will give you your role along with your\
  \ third power feat. In all three cases, that means you'll select your third power\
  \ feat from your shiny new role card.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\
