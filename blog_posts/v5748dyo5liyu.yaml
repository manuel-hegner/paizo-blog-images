  \ in products like <a href=\"/products/btpy8j5u\"><em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting:\
  \ Rule of Fear</em></a>, and pretty much wherever else I'm given the chance, I've\
  \ talked quite a bit about how to run unsettling Pathfinder games(—you're all coming\
  \ to our <a href=\"http://gencon.highprogrammer.com/gencon-2016.cgi/event/SEM1699489\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Horror in Pathfinder event at Gen Con, right?). In writing Chapter\
  \ 6 of </a><a href=\"/products/btpy9n5a\"><em>Pathfinder RPG: Horror Adventures</em></a>,\
  \ Running Horror Adventures (and in the book's section on \"Playing Horror a Hero\"\
  ), I've compiled some of my creepiest techniques and gaming philosophies, sharing\
  \ them to help all you GMs out there make your Pathfinder games truly frightening.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>But creating a truly unnerving game isn't as simple as choosing the\
  \ scariest monsters and dreaming up spooky plots. To that end, the chapter starts\
  \ by asking what you're trying to accomplish by running a horror game. A horror\
  \ game is—obviously—meant to be \"horrifying,\" but who are you as the GM trying\
  \ to horrify? The characters or the players? And, in either case, are the players\
  \ cool with that? The GM and players being of the same mind regarding the experience\
  \ they're sharing is one of the most overlooked but most important parts of running\
  \ a horror game, so we cover all that right up front.</p> \n     <p>Once we're certain\
  \ everyone's in for horror, the chapter delves into a discussion of several popular\
  \ horror genres—like cosmic horror, ghost stories, gothic horror, and others. Beyond\
  \ just the themes and plots associated with these genres, each explores tools in\
  \ the Pathfinder RPG that can help you affect these specific modes of terror. Want\
  \ to know what monsters work best for slasher horror? No prob. Want some basic and\
  \ advanced plots for running psychological horror games? I've got you covered. Not\
  \ sure what a body horror game is? Oh boy, do I have some stories for you.</p> \n\

  \    </div> \n     <p>But even the best rules and plots are only stepping-stones\
  \ to creating unsettling game experiences. Therefore, a meaty chunk of the chapter\
  \ provides some of my favorite tips for steeping your game in an ambiance that lets\
  \ fear flourish. These go beyond just tips for lighting and sound, providing simple\
  \ and reasonable theatrics GMs can employ to keep their players engaged, as well\
  \ as ways players can contribute to a sense of fear and mystery. Maybe even more\
  \ useful, there's also a solid list of things NOT to try.</p> \n     <p>One of the\
  \ most important elements of building a game's atmosphere, though, is to keep up\
  \ the momentum. There's nothing creepy about interrupting the game to flip through\
  \ rulebooks for 10 minutes. So, to help avoid that, the chapter's final section\
  \ covers rules ad-libbing. These are things you can do to use the rules you know\
  \ (or have on hand) to roll with whatever crazy scheme the players come up with.\
  \ Beyond just telling you what every veteran GM already knows—that you can tinker\
  \ with the rules as much as you want—this section gives you a step-by-step process\
  \ on how to think like an ad-liber and how to kit-bash whatever rules you need on\
  \ the fly. As a result, it walks you through how to run situations like being buried\
  \ alive or burned at the stake using bits from the rules toolbox you already have.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Overall, the chapter is designed to be a guide to running horror games,\
  \ but there are a ton of tools here to add to your bag of GMing tricks. Chapter\
  \ 6 of <a href=\"/products/btpy9n5a\"><em>Horror Adventures</em></a> helps you learn\
  \ what sort of story your players are up for, assists you in setting the stage,\
  \ and then gives you techniques to make PCs dread what's to come. Those skills are\
  \ handy for running a horror game, but, in my opinion, they're vital to any Pathfinder\
  \ game you want to make truly memorable.</p> \n     <p><a href=\"/products/btpy9n5a\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder RPG: Horror Adventures</em></a> debuts in just a few short weeks.\
  \ Look for it here on paizo.com, your local game store, or at the Paizo booth at\
  \ Gen Con!</p> \n     <p>F. Wesley Schneider<br> <i>Editor-in-Chief</i></p> \n \
