  Ready to keep going? Break time’s done.” Kyra straightened from her meditative stance\
  \ in the darkened, deadened grass.</p>\n      <p>Merisiel had been pacing for the\
  \ past few minutes already, eager to continue onward, muscles twitching in anticipation—\
  chomping at the bit to keep going. Kyra had seen the elf’s posture like this many\
  \ times and already knew the answer before it was voiced. Still, Merisiel turned\
  \ an analytical eye toward her companion.</p>\n      <p>“That’s on you,” Merisiel\
  \ said. “You used some magic back there. Are <em>you</em> ready to keep moving?”\
  </p>\n      <p>“I’m ready,” Kyra confirmed, stretching away the stasis in her limbs,\
  \ chuckling to herself as Merisiel practically leapt forward.</p>\n      <p>Kyra\
  \ hung back a step, letting the elf take lead this time. The light was dim and muted\
  \ here, and Merisiel was far better trained to step silently. Not that they particularly\
  \ needed to, but it was generally good practice, especially here. This woodland\
  \ commanded an almost reverent silence.</p>\n      <p>It wasn’t like other places\
  \ Kyra had visited. She’d certainly seen her share of forest travel, but the Uskwood—\
  and this particular part of it—was something different. Trees grew tall but held\
  \ an innate <em>roughness</em> to them; branches twisted, splintered, or hunched\
  \ as though in pain, yet still reached hopefully to the sky.</p>\n      <p>She couldn’\
  t blame the trees for reaching toward the light. She would, too, if this was her\
  \ home. Even the air felt heavier here than it did in sun-touched lands. Blue-gray\
  \ fog wisped lazily at her feet and slithered away like a living creature. It made\
  \ travel difficult for the two of them, obscuring the distance but offering a dim,\
  \ hazy reflection of the light. Small comfort there.</p>\n      <p>There were stretches\
  \ of Nidal and the Uskwood where the border between their universe and the shadowy\
  \ realm of the Netherworld grew thin. While several of these rifts were already\
  \ known and studied, the two adventurers knew there might be others that would randomly\
  \ appear.</p>\n      <p>They’d just hoped to avoid them. Alas.</p>\n      <p>“It’\
  s a nice place to visit, but I wouldn’t want to live here,” Merisiel said, smirking\
  \ as she made her way forward step by careful step. In the unsettling silence, she\
  \ didn’t have to speak loudly for her words to travel.</p>\n      <p>Kyra smiled\
  \ despite herself. It was technically Merisiel’s fault they agreed to this mission\
  \ in the first place; she wouldn’t have found herself in the Uskwood under normal\
  \ circumstances. She responded quietly, “Definitely not.”</p>\n      <p>Silence\
  \ descended on them again, smothering and cumbersome. Step by step, they proceeded\
  \ alertly in this sinister quietude. The shadow-swept wood played with their senses;\
  \ several times already during their trek, they’d both caught motion out of the\
  \ corners of their eyes, only to find a disturbing lack of anything substantial.\
  \ Whispers just on the edge of hearing teased them, only to result in nothing: no\
  \ one there and little more than a persistent feeling of disquiet and of being toyed\
  \ with by forces ever out of sight.</p>\n      <p>It was starting to grate on them\
  \ both.</p>\n      <p>“Sooo,” sighed Merisiel quietly, “not to alarm you, but I’\
  ve started to see things again.”</p>\n      <p>“Me too. Eyes watching in the trees,”\
  \ Kyra answered. “More this time.”</p>\n      <p>Meri nodded agreement and both\
  \ women moved their hands toward their respective weapons in preparation for a fight.\
  \ During the last few hours, the appearance of the wispy illusions had all been\
  \ false alarms, but to relax now would be foolish.</p>\n      <br>\n      <div class=\"\

  >Pathfinder GM Core</a></i>.</p>\n      </div>\n      <br>\n      <p>As if guided\
  \ by the hands of divinity, Kyra caught sight of strange, glowing eyes at the corner\
  \ of her vision, then turned to look in the opposite direction—just in time to watch\
  \ the nearby shadows spit out a giant, color-drained cat, its jaw extended and its\
  \ long, misshapen claws stretching out for her, mid-pounce!</p>\n      <p>She met\
  \ the strange creature with a startled cry. Her scimitar flashed in her hand, angled\
  \ between them. It was an imperfect defense, she knew, even before her sword arm\
  \ complained from the sharp sting of claw and tooth. At least the creature was wounded\
  \ as well; its red blood turned gray and shadowy as it met the dark ground and melted\
  \ into it.</p>\n      <p><em>If I’d hesitated but one second longer...</em></p>\n\
  \      <p>But then Merisiel was beside her, jumping from the fog-filled shadows\
  \ behind the beast. Her face was contorted into a vicious snarl, and her daggers\
  \ were lightning-fast, stabbing at the creature who attacked her wife before she\
  \ retreated out of sight again.</p>\n      <p>Kyra’s mind whirled as quickly as\
  \ her scimitar. They’d already encountered a small group of similar creatures, bleached\
  \ of their color yet somehow<em>harder</em> to see in the dark mists of the forest,\
  \ which commanded the shadows at their will and were, in turn, twisted by them.\
  \ The previous attack had come from a sickly-looking stag who needed reminding that\
  \ deer did not typically hunger for flesh. It was surely a mercy to put the crazed,\
  \ blood-hungry creature to rest. They’d learned a lot from that battle.</p>\n  \
  \    <p>It was the Netherworld’s influence on the real world, she knew. The animal\
  \ inhabitants of the shadowy plane were bizarre, distorted beings that were a strange\
  \ mirror to their own. When the planes bled into each other, as they did so strangely\
  \ here… Well, it was no surprise there was some intermingling of worlds.</p>\n \
  \     <p>That didn’t make it any easier, though.</p>\n      <p>“It brought a friend!”\
  \ Merisiel emerged from the shadows again, this time sending two daggers flying.\
  \ One sank into the meaty, pale shank of the shadow-cat, and the other flew right\
  \ past Kyra’s ear, hurtling toward the new enemy. “I think you’d be better handle\
  \ that one, my love!”</p>\n      <p>With Meri commanding the feline’s attention,\
  \ Kyra whipped around to follow the line of the elf’s weapon, though the crawling\
  \ feeling along the back of her neck already told her the nature of the enemy behind\
  \ her.</p>\n      <p>The creature was difficult to pick out at first, as it seemed\
  \ to be merely the shadow of a nearby tree. Kyra’s eyes caught the strange, liquid\
  \ movement of the being as it slithered from its base, all harsh angles and thorny,\
  \ smoky darkness made manifest and given horrible life.</p>\n      <p>Horrible <em>unlife</em>,\
  \ Kyra corrected herself, already feeling the burning heat of holy purpose filling\
  \ her breast. Her right hand clenched around the golden idol of Sarenrae and thrust\
  \ it up and outward. The Dawnflower’s magic answered, and the cleric focused it\
  \ onto the shadow. A holy nimbus surrounded her clenched fist, and golden, magical\
  \ fire lashed toward the creature, hungrily seeking to purge the corruption with\
  \ its own radiant force. The undead reeled as divine magic lashed it, leaving it\
  \ wounded and weakened.</p>\n      <p>Between the two of them, their enemies stood\
  \ no chance. Merisiel’s seemingly endless supply of daggers, combined with her supreme\
  \ agility, allowed her to easily get herself into advantageous positions. Kyra’\
  s battle might shone as brightly as the angelic ankh idol in her hand, held aloft\
  \ and glowing with sanctified cleansing magic.</p>\n      <p>It never failed to\
  \ impress her how good of a team she and Merisiel made. In short time, their enemies\
  \ were conquered, their weapons were cleaned, and their wounds were healed with\
  \ a few, warming words and channeled magics.</p>\n      <p>Kyra sighed, worn down\
  \ from a long day of exploration and battle. With a weary smile, she insisted, “\
  Next time, love, I choose the mission.”</p>\n      <p>“How was I to know it was\
  \ going to be this exciting?” Merisiel playfully retorted before dropping back into\
  \ a more serious tone. “Look, we’re almost there. Just think: soon we’ll be at Volsazni\
  \ Dezarr’s country home. We’ll enjoy a nice, long rest, a good meal, and we’ll be\
  \ able to ask him more about the artifact we’re looking for. Easy!”</p>\n      <p>Kyra\
  \ released a long breath. They could both use a good rest, she admitted to herself.</p>\n\
  \      <p>She had no idea how true that would become by journey’s end.</p>\n   \
