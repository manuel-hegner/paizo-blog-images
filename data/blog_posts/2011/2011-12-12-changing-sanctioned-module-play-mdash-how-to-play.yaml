              <h1>Changing Sanctioned Module Play</h1>
              <p class="date">Monday, December 12, 2011</p>
              <p>A year ago, Pathfinder Modules were sanctioned for play in Pathfinder Society Organized Play. As Atlanta Venture-Captain for a year, I appreciated the fact I could offer the sanctioned modules to local players, especially those who had played every scenario that had been released. But the rules that were established bothered me. No negative effects carried over from module play, even death or consumable use. Many players I talked with felt that sanctioned module play was not as good as it could be because of the rules put into place. One of my top goals when hired as Campaign Coordinator was to reevaluate sanctioned modules and see if we could change the way they worked to make them a more valuable part of the Pathfinder Society Organized Play campaign.</p>
              <p>What I would like to see in the comments to this blog are what you do and don’t like about the below proposal. How will this proposal affect your game in both a positive and negative way. Once I review feedback over the next few weeks, the Venture-Captains, Venture-Lieutenants, and I can decide what changes we want to make in the upcoming 4.1 update to the <a href="/products/btpy84k4"><em>Guide to Pathfinder Society Organized Play</em></a>.</p>
              <div style="margin-bottom:2px">
               <b>Spoiler:</b> <input type="button" value="Show" class="spoilerButton" onclick="toggleSpoiler(this)">
               <div class="spoilerText">
                <p>Pathfinder modules are produced for a wider audience than just Pathfinder Society Organized Play. Because modules are structured differently from scenarios, the specific rules changes needed for playing sanctioned modules in Pathfinder Society Organized Play are presented below.</p>
                <h2>How to Play</h2>
                <p>Sanctioned modules are generally three times the length of a standard Pathfinder Society scenario and will likely take players two or three 4—5 hour sessions to complete. They do not contain Pathfinder Society faction missions, nor are they tiered for play by characters over a wide range of levels. Thematically, modules do not assume the characters are members of the Pathfinder Society. GMs and players are encouraged to create a reasonable plot hook for their characters’ participation.</p>
                <h2>Legal Pathfinder Society Characters</h2>
                <p>Players have the following three options when playing sanctioned modules for Pathfinder Society:</p>
                <ul>
                 <li>A player must use an existing Pathfinder Society character (without modification) within one level of the module’s starting level.</li>
                 <li>For modules below 9th level, a player who does not have a character in the correct level range may use a Pathfinder Society pregenerated character available on paizo.com. In this case, the chronicle sheet must be linked to an existing Pathfinder Society character and applied when that character reaches the level of the module. The linked character must be declared before play begins and recorded on the scenario reporting sheet.</li>
                 <li>As mentioned in Chapter 5 of the <a href="/products/btpy84k4"><em>Guide to Pathfinder Society Organized Play</em></a>, if you have already played the sanctioned module and wish to play it an additional time for any reason, you must inform the GM that you have already played the sanctioned module. If you spoil the plot for the other players at the table, the GM has the right to ask you to leave. You are free to replay the sanctioned module in order to meet a minimum PC requirement (see Chapter 7), but if you already have received a player Chronicle for this sanctioned module for any of your PCs, you do not earn any additional rewards beyond having a good time. The Tier 1 exception still applies for Tier 1-—2 modules.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Conditions, Death, and Expendables</h2>
                <p>Whether playing your own character or a pregenerated character, all conditions (including death) not resolved within the module carry beyond the end of the module. Likewise, any wealth spent or resources expended during the course of the adventure are tracked and must be recorded on the Chronicle sheet.</p>
                <p>If you are using a pregenerated character, calculate the cost of any consumables used and mark this cost on the Chronicle sheet. Any remaining conditions are applied to the linked character when the Chronicle sheet is applied to that character.</p>
                <p>The one exception is when a character remains dead at the conclusion of the module. In this case, the linked character is permanently dead and removed from play immediately. In resolving any conditions on a pregenerated character, Prestige Points and gold from the linked character may be used to pay for the cost of the <em>raise dead</em> or <em>resurrection</em> spell.</p>
                <h2>Applying Credit</h2>
                <p>All players receive a Chronicle sheet unless, at the GM’s discretion, they are replaying the module for no credit. If a player uses an existing Pathfinder Society character for the adventure, he must apply the Chronicle sheet to that character immediately. A player who uses a pregenerated character must apply the Chronicle sheet to his linked Pathfinder Society character when that character reaches the starting level of the module.</p>
                <p>A GM who runs a module may likewise apply the Chronicle sheet to one of her Pathfinder Society characters. The GM must decide which of her characters will receive the Chronicle sheet when the module is completed and the Chronicle sheets are filled out. Playing a module from beginning to end earns a character 3 XP and 4 Prestige Points if that character is on the normal advancement track or 1.5 XP and 2 Prestige Points for characters on the slow advancement track. There are no day job rolls when playing a sanctioned module.</p>
                <p>If a character dies and is brought back to life, the GM must determine the rewards for that character. The minimum possible reward is 0 GP, 1 XP and 1 PP on the normal advancement track or 1/2 XP and 1/2 Prestige Point on the slow advancement track. If a character participates in more than 2/3 of the module, he should receive full rewards. GMs and active players are encouraged to hasten the return of a character waiting to be raised from the dead.</p>
                <p>Players who do not complete each game session earn 1 fewer XP and Prestige Point for each session missed. This also applies to players who join later sessions; they receive 1 fewer XP and Prestige Point for each session missed. In both cases players earn a minimum of 1 XP and 1 Prestige Point (or 1/2 XP and 1/2 Prestige Point on the slow advancement track). If a character earns more XP than she needs to reach her next level, she may not choose to switch advancement tracks at the new level earned.</p>
                <p>As always, each player may receive credit for each module once as a player and once as a GM, in either order. Players must accept a Chronicle sheet for their character the first time they play a module. A player may replay a module at the GM’s discretion, but the player may not receive more than one player Chronicle sheet per module. The only exception is Tier 1—2 modules. A player may only play a Tier 1—2 module for credit once with a 2nd-level character, but may use additional 1st-level characters to replay the same module for credit.</p>
                <h2>Running Multi-Session Modules</h2>
                <p>Since sanctioned modules can be multi-session events, Pathfinder Society characters may not be used in other Pathfinder Society events until they receive a Chronicle sheet for the module. This does not apply to a player using a pregenerated character until the linked character reaches the starting level of the module.</p>
                <p>GMs are advised to work with players who miss the final session of the module in order for those players to receive their Chronicle sheets.</p>
               </div>
              </div>
              <h2>Retirement and Beyond</h2>
              <p>In the interest of allowing Pathfinder Society characters to extend their adventuring careers, and to utilize sanctioned Pathfinder Modules to their fullest enjoyment, I would like feedback on allowing Pathfinder Society characters to advance past 12th level for sanctioned module play only.</p>
              <p>The level cap for the campaign is still 12. There are no current plans for us to publish any Pathfinder Society scenarios of 13th level or higher. However, there are more modules on the schedule that are 13+ levels. We do have some stand-alone, Tier 12 scenarios on the radar for those that do not wish to play <a href="/products/btpy8bub"><em>Eyes of the Ten</em></a>, but wish to play three additional scenarios at 12th level and then retire. Just as with every other Pathfinder Society Scenario, <em>Eyes of the Ten</em> is not open for replay and that isn't going to change. So, the addition of more Tier 12 scenarios, or another retirement arc, allows for players to have options.</p>
              <p>This part of the proposal would allow people to play a “retired” character through higher-level sanctioned modules, receive credit, and not have to play an artificially leveled character. This also helps to balance the wealth-by-level curve as presented currently at the end of <em>Eyes of the Ten</em> that presents 13th-level wealth for 12th-level characters. Right now it is difficult for us to plan special retirement events for 12th-level characters mentioned 3 years ago because characters’ wealth-by-level is so imbalanced.</p>
              <p>Mark and I have discussed this and here is how I plan to incorporate advancement for 13th level and higher. This will open up the extended career of Pathfinder Society characters if people want to utilize modules in that manner.</p>
              <div style="margin-bottom:2px">
               <b>Spoiler:</b> <input type="button" value="Show" class="spoilerButton" onclick="toggleSpoiler(this)">
               <div class="spoilerText">
                <p>Once you reach 12th level, it would require 3 XP to advance to 13th level and beyond as normal. We will adjust the <em>Eyes of the Ten</em> arc so you receive 2 XP after Part 1 and 1 XP for Parts 2, 3, and 4. Once you complete Parts 1 and 2 of <em>Eyes of the Ten</em>, you may advance your character to 13th level. Mark and I reviewed Parts 3 and 4 and all CRs are higher than 13 so there shouldn't be a significant effect on the play of either of those. Once you complete <em>Eyes of the Ten</em>, you will still be 13th level and one XP short of advancement of 14th level. This will allow you to roll right into playing <a href="/products/btpy8l3i"><em>Academy of Secrets</em></a> at level for the module. Any character who has completed Parts 1 and 2 of <em>Eyes of the Ten</em> may advance to 13th level.</p>
                <p>At 13th level, you can then play your Pathfinder Society character in <em>Academy of Secrets</em> and receive full credit as normal, but you may play it at 13th level. We will be adjusting the gold received at the end of <em>Academy of Secrets</em>.</p>
                <p>Upon completion of <em>Academy of Secrets</em>, the character would receive 3 XP and be one short of 15th level.</p>
                <p>At the end of <a href="/products/btpy8j5y"><em>Tomb of the Iron Medusa</em>, the character would receive 3 more XP and be one short of 16th level.</a></p><a href="/products/btpy8j5y"> </a>
                <p><a href="/products/btpy8j5y">In the future, Paizo will release additional high-level modules that will also be sanctioned for play. We will eventually sanction </a><a href="/products/btpy8go0"><em>The Witchwar Legacy</em></a> once it is possible for someone having played everything to reach 17th level. We will make gold adjustments accordingly for those Chronicle sheets.</p>
                <p>To help GMs and players use their Pathfinder Society characters in retirement and beyond, both the wealth and Fame tables will be extended beyond their current limits.</p>
               </div>
              </div>
              <br>
              <p>The above changes would not go into effect until version 4.1 of the <a href="/products/btpy84k4"><em>Guide to Pathfinder Society Organized Play</em></a> is released. Also, I am very aware that people might be in the middle of a multiple-play session for a sanctioned module, or be involved in a play-by-post game that takes months instead of one or two game sessions.</p>
              <p>If these changes were to go into effect, I plan to grandfather in modules caught in the middle of multiple sessions when this goes live. I also plan to assign a Venture-Captain as the coordinator for this endeavor. Players and GMs will have a month to register their games as "grandfathered" games. After that time, no new module play should begin under the old rules. These registered "grandfathered" games have until the start of Season 4 to complete their games and report such to the Venture-Captain.</p>
              <p>So there you have it. This is a proposal to modify play of sanctioned modules to bring them more in line with standard scenario play, as well as open options for players to extend the life of their Pathfinder Society characters. As mentioned at the beginning of this blog, I would like to hear what you do and don’t like about the above proposal, and how this proposal would affect your game in both a positive and negative way if put into place.</p>
