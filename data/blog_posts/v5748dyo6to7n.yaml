  \     <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Hiya, Starfinders! It’s Jenny\
  \ Jarzabski, Starfinder Senior Developer and Sparkly Space Princess. It’s no secret\
  \ that <em>Mechageddon!</em> was my dream project, but I’m not the only one who\
  \ feels that way. A group of amazing authors teamed up to make this project a reality,\
  \ much like the squad of mech pilots you’ll be playing in your <em>Mechageddon!</em>\
  \ campaign. What we created together is special not just because of its epic story,\
  \ unforgettable characters, gorgeous art, high CR encounters, and new rules content;\
  \ it’s special because the whole team is so passionate about <em>Mechageddon!</em>\
  \ and poured their hearts and souls into its creation.</p>\n      <p>This passion\
  \ was evident in the extracurricular hangouts, playtests, and planning meetings\
  \ the authors scheduled with and without me. To prepare for the writing phase, the\
  \ writing team got together for a few movie nights. We watched a lot of epic anime\
  \ and cheesy 80s movies, bonding over our shared passion for mecha media. It was\
  \ important to us to highlight certain tropes and themes, and our time together\
  \ created synergy between the adventures and backmatter articles. But don’t worry,\
  \ <em>Mechageddon!</em>isn’t all anime sparkles and action movie schlock. (Not 100%,\
  \ anyway.) The authors each brought their own perspectives to the project, pulling\
  \ inspiration from their lived experiences, favorite media, and more.</p>\n    \
  \  <p>On the surface, a tabletop campaign like <em>Mechageddon!</em> is a fun way\
  \ to pass the time playing a game with your friends. But for many of us, it’s also\
  \ a way to escape our problems and worries for a few hours. The magic of tabletop\
  \ storytelling is that it can be a way to explore our dreams, desires, and fears\
  \ in a safe setting, or a way to play out scenarios that imagine better worlds or\
  \ tell cautionary tales of timelines gone wrong. In that respect, <em>Mechageddon!</em>\
  \ can be whatever you want it to be, but here’s what it means to us.</p>\n     \

  \ Regodón Harkness</p>\n      </div>\n      <br>\n      <h3>Joseph Blomquist (he/him)<br>\n\
  \        Adventure 1 Author</h3>\n      <p>I was ten years old, the ideal age for\
  \ mecha indoctrination, when <em>Robotech</em> hit American shores. Sure, I’d already\
  \ enjoyed Americanized anime in <em>Battle of the Planets, Voltron</em>, and <em>Tranzor\
  \ Z</em>, but <em>Robotech</em> was different. For the first time, there was character-driven,\
  \ dramatic storytelling in an animated show about alien attacks and giant robot\
  \ combat, and halfway through the first season, my favorite character died! This\
  \ was a big change for cartoons in the states, and I was sold—hook, line, and sinker.</p>\n\
  \      <p>From there, my media interests changed. I immersed myself in the anime\
  \ that were the basis of <em>Robotech: Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross, Genesis\
  \ Climber Mospeada,</em> and most importantly, <em>Super Dimension Fortress Macross</em>.\
  \ My interests grew to encompass the <em>Fang of the Sun Dougram</em> and <em>Gundam</em>.\
  \ While my friends identified with their heroes from He-man, GI Joe, and Thundercats,\
  \ my tastes involved giant robots piloted by the types of heroes that propaganda\
  \ movies could be made about. And don’t even get me started on kaiju!</p>\n    \
  \  <p>My interest in games followed suit with a love of <em>BattleTech</em>, <em>Mekton</em>,\
  \ and <em>Heavy Gear</em> taking up a great deal of my playtime. So, when my D20-based\
  \ RPG of choice began building towards mecha stories, I knew I wanted to be a part\
  \ of it. But I was lucky; I’d already written for Starfinder, and I had been running\
  \ games for Paizo Organized Play since the beginning—I was a known quantity. Regardless,\
  \ when Jenny asked if I would be interested in contributing to the project, there\
  \ was nothing that could have kept me away.</p>\n      <p><em>Mechageddon!</em>\
  \ is one of the most fun projects I could ever have hoped to be a part of. For “\
  research,” I watched a lot of movies, like <em>Pacific Rim</em> and <em>Robot Jox</em>,\
  \ in addition to diving deep into some of the anime I’d missed over the years—especially\
  \ the later <em>Macross</em> stuff (oh, how I missed you, <em>Macross</em>). There\
  \ was a timely renewed interest in <em>BattleTech</em>, <em>Heavy Gear</em> got\
  \ a new edition, and I had the opportunity to seed some of the tropes and brilliance\
  \ of the shows I loved into my writing.</p>\n      <p><em>Mechageddon!</em> is a\
  \ love letter to the anime, films, and media that came before it. The adventure\
  \ is full of dramatic moments and enough giant robot combat to whet any appetite.\
  \ It’s an adventure where the people you meet matter and where encounters are harrowing\
  \ and full of meaning, dropping hints and plot points for the future. It’s like\
  \ no Adventure Path you’ve seen before. For my part, I worked alongside two of the\
  \ best authors in the Paizosphere, and the three of us even met outside of our shared\
  \ server to put together something of a story bible to inform our tale that could\
  \ seed dozens more adventures! I envy you, fearless reader, for the journey you\
  \ will get to experience and the stories you will tell.</p>\n      <p>Until that\
  \ day, New Valor stands!</p>\n      <p>Oh, and I can be found rarely ever writing\
  \ on my <a href=\"http://www.underwearontheoutside.com/\">blog</a>, or on social\
  \ media under the name DoctorMono.</p>\n      <br>\n      <h3>Dennis Muldoon (he/him)<br>\n\
  \       Adventure 2 Author</h3>\n      <p><em>Mechaggedon!</em> Oh, what a joy!\
  \ Over the last few years, I’ve written for nearly every line Paizo publishes, but\
  \ this is without a doubt the biggest, most challenging, and most exciting project\
  \ I’ve ever worked on. I love how Starfinder allows us to tell so many different\
  \ types of stories, and the mech rules are one of my favorite tools in the GM toolbox.\
  \ My own love for mechs dates to my childhood watching <em>Transformers</em>, <em>Voltron</em>,\
  \ and of course, that seminal classic, <em>Robot Jox</em>.</p>\n      <p>For <em>Mechaggedon!</em>,\
  \ I wrote the middle volume, the space where the plucky heroes get to catch their\
  \ breath after the initial rush, take stock of their new careers as mech pilots\
  \ and heroes of New Valor, and find their place in the wider universe. What could\
  \ go wrong? This volume presents the players with choices to make, opportunities\
  \ to build relationships and earn allies, and space to truly make their mechs their\
  \ own. I’m particularly proud of the variety of missions presented in this volume,\
  \ as they draw inspiration from sources ranging from space operas to westerns to\
  \ real-world corporate labor politics, before ultimately tying together to lead\
  \ to something bigger. I can’t wait for you all to play it!</p>\n      <br>\n  \
  \    <h3>Rigby Bendele (they/them)<br>\n        Adventure 3 Author</h3>\n      <p><br>\n\
  \       I wish I could sit down and tell you every little detail I included in my\
  \ volume of&nbsp;<em>Mechageddon!</em> However, since I wrote the final book, that\
  \ mean sharing major spoilers for the plot. Since I can't do&nbsp;<em>that</em>,\
  \ I'd instead talk about my inspirations!</p>\n      <p><em>Devilman</em>&nbsp;is\
  \ one of the most influential works of art I've ever experienced. It is also deeply\
  \ weird and even unenjoyable at points, with a complex lore and timeline that honestly\
  \ hurts my head to think about too much. For my adventure, I drew much on what I\
  \ found meaningful about&nbsp;<em>Devilman</em>, from its corruption narratives,\
  \ to the feelings of apocalypse it conveys, to downright weird demon designs.&nbsp;<em>Mechageddon!&nbsp;</em>(at\
  \ least my section) is also deeply informed by my experience as a queer person,\
  \ my relationship to religion, and the strange ways that religion might function\
  \ in a world where you could meet many of the gods. My volume is in part about trying\
  \ to fight an apocalypse you don't want to be in, but also about what it means to\
  \ want love from a god who will never love you back. In that way, it's also about\
  \ work, and about how many people believe that a job you love can never love you\
  \ back.</p>\n      <p>Mech stories are also tied into stories about bodies. I finished\
  \ writing&nbsp;<em>Mechageddon!&nbsp;</em>the day before I underwent gender-affirming\
  \ surgery. In my section, there's many kinds of bodies and relationships to them:\
  \ kaiju bodies, bodies that have changed (positive), bodies that have changed (negative),\
  \ big robot bodies, and more. You also may be thinking, \"Wow, Rigby, that's doing\
  \ a&nbsp;<em>lot</em>!\" Well, yes—but this adventure is also a deep dive into the\
  \ mech genre and will be hopefully played across hundreds of hours with your friends.\
  \ Many of these things end up naturally intertwined. The demands on the body are\
  \ often the demands of capitalism, or the demands of patriarchy, or the interpolation\
  \ of white supremacy into our own desires.</p>\n      <p>Okay, okay, that's the\
  \ big philosophy. It's also about punching demons while being in a mech suit, the\
  \ relationship you have with other pilots, and saving the world! The point is this:\
  \ it’s going to be fun,it's going to be big, and it's going to be a story you'll\
  \ remember!</p>\n      <br>\n      <h3>Kate Baker (she/her)<br>\n        Contributing\
  \ Author</h3>\n      <p><br>\n       Hello! I’m Kate Baker, and I can’t wait for\
  \ you to experience <em>Mechageddon!</em> I couldn’t resist contributing to an Adventure\
  \ Path that lets the PCs run around in giant mechs. What could be better? I enjoyed\
  \ watching <em>Pacific Rim</em>, <em>Robot Jox</em>, and even the dubious <em>Robot\
  \ Wars</em> (on MST3k) to get inspiration. I worked on backmatter, creating both\
  \ a mech that you’ll encounter and a Side Job you can go do for some extra cash.\
  \ Just don’t forget to bring your mechs! You can follow more about what I’m up to\
  \ on BlueSky at @katebakerGM.&nbsp;</p>\n      <br>\n      <h3>Anthony Dollinger\
  \ (he/him)<br>\n        Contributing Author</h3>\n      <p>Mechs are rad.Anyone\
  \ who’s known me for any amount of time knows that I am a mecha fan, so taking part\
  \ in&nbsp;<em>Mechageddon!&nbsp;</em>was an opportunity I immediately jumped at.\
  \ I can distinctly remember walking into a bookstore in New Orleans in 1995, seeing\
  \ this cool mech book on the shelf, and realizing that <em>MechWarrior&nbsp;</em>was\
  \ more than just a one-off of the distant past.&nbsp;Many years later, a resurgent&nbsp;<em>Macross’\
  &nbsp;</em>newest series helped to remind me that everyone loves giant robots no\
  \ matter what flavor they come in. They have a magic to them that can be used to\
  \ tell unique stories and lift spirits. In that way,&nbsp;<em>Mechageddon!&nbsp;</em>was\
  \ something of a dream come true to work on, especially as I was able to design\
  \ new mechs and had the opportunity to bring the city of New Valor to life. I hope\
  \ that what we’ve put together can lift your spirits, wherever you are, and help\
  \ you to remember love as you strive to defend New Valor.</p>\n      <br>\n    \
  \  <h3>Mikko Kallio (he/him)<br>\n        Contributing Author</h3>\n      <p>Hey\
  \ there! I'm Mikko, a cloud architect by day and a game designer when the stars\
  \ come out. My journey as a Paizo freelancer began in 2014, and since then, I've\
  \ left my creative mark on around 50 fantastic products. For&nbsp;<em>Mechageddon!</em>,\
  \ I wrote a Side Job in which you and your trusty mechs venture to a planet of dinosaurs.\
  \ Get ready for high-speed thrills, breathtaking views of wind-kissed hills, steamy\
  \ jungles, and fiery volcanoes, plus a hearty dose of head-banging riffs courtesy\
  \ of Abysshead—the undisputed overlords of the Pact Worlds music scene. Hope you\
  \ have a blast playing it!</p>\n      <p>My fascination with mechs and towering\
  \ robots goes way back. My earliest influences came from shows like <em>Power Rangers</em>\
  \ and <em>Transformers</em>, and who could forget that iconic moment when Ellen\
  \ Ripley hops into a power loader and takes on a xenomorph queen? Legendary stuff.\
  \ A newer fascination of mine is Scythe, a world that seamlessly weaves diesel-punk\
  \ mechs into a reimagined 1920s setting.</p>\n      <p>Let me wrap up with a story.\
  \ Flashback to 2017, when Paizo presented me with an intriguing challenge: writing\
  \ an interactive special named&nbsp;<a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy9tld?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-900-Assault-on-Absalom\"\
  ><em>Assault on Absalom</em>&nbsp;</a>for the Pathfinder Society. One of the missions\
  \ in that adventure involved unearthing an ancient weapon, and my imagination was\
  \ on fire. What if this weapon took the form of a gargantuan construct? What if\
  \ the players could pilot it, controlling distinct limbs and weapons? And so, Gulgamodh\
  \ emerged—a sentinel that dutifully guarded Absalom and perhaps inspired the seeds\
  \ of future mech wonders.</p>\n      <br>\n      <h3>Chris Wasko (he/him)<br>\n\
  \        Contributing Author</h3>\n      <p>I had a ton of fun writing an alien,\
  \ a mech, and a Side Job for&nbsp;<em>Mechageddon!</em> The first came easily after\
  \ I found a video of a starfish walking along the beach. The creature's form was\
  \ so familiar and yet so alien, so I thought of how I'd stat it if I turned it upside\
  \ down and made it mech-sized. Considering its&nbsp;environment reminded me of the\
  \ long history of otyughs as both violent monsters and a source of curious social\
  \ encounters, a perfect fit for my armored junkyard behemoth. The latter two took\
  \ some time, and ultimately became homages to my online Roll20 campaigns that withered\
  \ as life got complicated.</p>\n      <p>My&nbsp;<a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy94qz?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-79-The-HalfDead-City\"\
  ><em>Mummy's Mask</em>&nbsp;</a>campaign fell off right after Book 5, when the PCs\
  \ encountered the flying pyramids of ancient Osirion. Not having those mythical\
  \ structures as some form of airborne vehicle in the Starfinder setting's distant\
  \ future struck me as a ripe design space, especially for a book about mechs. Meanwhile,\
  \ my&nbsp;<a href=\"https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventures/adventurePath/flyFreeOrDie\"\
  ><em>Fly Free or Die&nbsp;</em></a>campaign wound down in the middle of my own installment,\
  \ <em>Crash and Burn</em>. The party was composed of eight people with variable\
  \ schedules that usually led to split sessions of four PCs each, so I would write\
  \ concurrent homebrew adventures alongside the published content so the two groups\
  \ could swap stories offline. One of those original adventures involved an ecological\
  \ mission to Osoro to study the irokirois, one of my favorite&nbsp;<a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujg?Starfinder-Alien-Archive\"\
  ><em>Alien Archive</em>&nbsp;</a>creatures, which&nbsp;I adapted into what appears\
  \ in <em>Mechageddon!</em> I hope you enjoy our work!</p>\n      <br>\n      <h3>Nick\
  \ Wasko (he/him) and K. Fox (they/them)<br>\n        Contributing Authors</h3>\n\
  \      <p>Nick and Fox have been writing together since Nick Wasko won Paizo's RPG\
  \ Superstar Season 9 contest. Nick inspired Fox's interest in Pathfinder and Starfinder,\
  \ and together they enjoyed creating new mechs for this Adventure Path. Nick and\
  \ Fox drew upon their backgrounds in health care for the&nbsp;idea of the Hecatomb,\
  \ which draws upon the operator's life force to function. High-level characters\
  \ have plenty of health, so sacrificing hit points to power a mech made a better\
  \ thematic and mechanical fit for a high-risk, high-reward playstyle among low-level\
  \ players.</p>\n      <p>Meanwhile, the Terrotodile started out as a thought experiment\
  \ for mechs designed for purposes other than combat. Its original intent was to\
  \ protect laborers mining for resources, but like so many inventions meant for the\
  \ betterment of society, it was repurposed for battle. Nick and Fox enjoyed this\
  \ opportunity to explore a departure from the high-powered war machines often seen\
  \ in this genre. Since they’ve recently struggled to make time for tabletop gaming,\
  \ they are especially excited for the opportunity to contribute to this project.\
  \ You can find more of Nick's work with Paizo <a href=\"https://paizo.com/people/NickWasko\"\

  \      <p><br>\n       (Jenny’s Note: DO IT! The fits are super cute AND MOST OF\
  \ THEM HAVE POCKETS!!!!)</p>\n      <br>\n      <h3>Diego Valdez (he/him)<br>\n\
  \        Contributing Author</h3>\n      <p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve always\
  \ enjoyed robots and mechs. I’ve been a huge <em>Transformers</em> fan since I was\
  \ small, and I regularly build Gundam models (as well as watch the shows), so creating\
  \ a mech was an opportunity I was excited for. I wanted to make something a little\
  \ more unique, different from a robot with a theme. One of the best toy lines on\
  \ the market, in my opinion, are the Diaclone Reboot figures. They’re super modular,\
  \ so it’s easy to swap parts and make your own creations. I really like that, so\
  \ I wondered: What if I could do that for a Starfinder mech? With that, the Mobile\
  \ Disunion was born. Just like the Diaclone Reboot figures, the Mobile Disunion\
  \ can be customized by players and their characters. Swap out the legs, the arms,\
  \ the head—whatever you want! Like with a <em>Transformer</em>, you can even change\
  \ the configurations in combat. I hope everyone enjoys playing with the Mobile Disunion\
  \ as much as I enjoyed creating it (and playing with some of my toys while I did)!</p>\n\
  \      <br>\n      <h3>Jenny Jarzabski (she/her/xe/xem)<br>\n        Narrative Lead\
  \ and Contributing Author</h3>\n      <p><em>Mechageddon!</em> is a love letter\
  \ to one of my favorite things in all the universe: mechs. But you knew that. Now\
  \ listen up, because I’m about to tell you a secret! I wasn’t really into mechs\
  \ growing up. I know, I know; it’s SACRILEGE! But listen, the mecha media in the\
  \ United States at that time targeted a more masc audience, and I was more of a\
  \ princesses and ponies type of kid. If Sailor Moon had summoned a sparkly mech\
  \ and fired its moon tiara magic laser, I would’ve been all in, but alas, that wasn’\
  t on offer at the time. It wasn’t until much later in life that I discovered the\
  \ joy of mechs that transform and power up to catchy music using the power of friendship.</p>\n\
  \      <p>One day a friend showed me a video clip from what would become my favorite\
  \ mecha anime, <em>Macross Delta</em>. In the video, a group of magical girls team\
  \ up with military mech pilots to defend a city from an alien attack, and they do\
  \ it by <em>singing</em>. I desperately wanted more context for this video, so I\
  \ dove into the show headfirst. Fast-forward to now: I’ve become a <em>Macross</em>superfan,\
  \ a player of <em>MechWarrior</em>, a builder of model kits, and an all-around mecha\
  \ enjoyer.&nbsp;</p>\n      <p>What really draws me to mechs, though? First and\
  \ foremost, mecha as a concept is inherently both badass and ridiculous, and there’\
  s as many wonderfully absurd gems out there as there are epic, grimdark treatises\
  \ on the realities of war and the nature of humanity. But I’ve identified some themes\
  \ most mecha media shares, regardless of where they fall on the spectrum from military\
  \ drama to super sentai. I’m inspired by these themes of friendship, loyalty, courage,\
  \ and hope in the face of doom. And who among us wouldn’t hop into a gigantic robot\
  \ and help their friends save the world if they had the chance?</p>\n      <p>Now’\
  s your chance!</p>\n      <p>I should clarify that we’re not actually saving <em>the</em>\
  \ world, but that we are going to save a planet in a TTRPG adventure. And for the\
  \ record, while saving the real world isn’t part of this campaign, I encourage you\
  \ to do your best at that, too.</p>\n      <p><strong>From all of us on the writing\
  \ team, we truly hope you enjoy the book we made for you! Use it well. </strong></p>\n\
