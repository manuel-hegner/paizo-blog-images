  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">“Oooh!” chirped Barsala,\
  \ folding her goggles down over her eyes. She peered at the man’s leg, an image\
  \ of the limb’s internal circuitry magnifying in her goggle’s lens. “The quality\
  \ on your inner gyros is excellent. Liquid carbide receptors?”</p> \n     <p>“Can\
  \ I see?” asked Keskodai. With a soft clicking of his mandibles, he leaned over\
  \ to get a closer look. “Chhk-chhk, look! See the pistons! Look at the little energy\
  \ regulators, aren’t they pretty?”</p> \n     <p>Raising one hand, Barsala waved\
  \ at the shirren. “Kes, please hun, you’re in my light.”</p> \n     <p>“But you\
  \ can see the problem, right?” asked Amril. Twitching nervously, the young man drummed\
  \ his fingers against the arm of the chair. “I mean, is it the regulators? I hope\
  \ it’s not the regulators. They should still be under warranty. Do you think it’\
  s the compression circuits?”</p> \n     <p>“Calm down,” said Barsala. The words\
  \ felt hollow in the face of her own burgeoning excitement. “It’ll be—”</p> \n \
  \    <p>Abruptly, his leg kicked. Trembling abruptly, the servos within whirred\
  \ energetically. “Look!” yelped Amril, the lashunta’s antenna shivering, “It’s doing\
  \ it again!”</p> \n     <p>“Fascinating... Kes, could you hand me the capacitor\
  \ over there?”</p> \n     <p>Inhaling, Amril turned his eyes toward the ceiling\
  \ of Barsala’s laboratory. “I knew I shouldn’t have got it cut rate. Stupid counterfeit\
  \ augments. The price was just too good. But then it started acting up. I checked\
  \ the actual prosthetic parts. I mean, I had it checked—an engineer. One of the\
  \ mechanics down at the junk races said its fine...”</p> \n     <p>“They’re right,”\
  \ commented Barsala, carefully separating two metal plates with two of her hands\
  \ while magnifying her lenses with another. “In as far as the hardware is in working\
  \ order. Whatever the problem is, it’s with the... Kes, please, you’re in my light\
  \ again... it’s with the software.”</p> \n     <p>Another juddering tremor flew\
  \ through Amril’s leg. He leaned up in the chair, excitedly. “I knew it! I mean,\
  \ I knew you’d be able to figure it out. The moment I saw your vids, I knew Dr.\
  \ B was the right person for the job! What are you going to do?”</p> \n     <p>“\
  Did you hear that, Chhk-chhk? Our friend Barsala’s an expert.”</p> \n     <p>“I\
  \ am hardly an expert on <em>this</em> particular subject, Chhk-Chhk, but,” she\
  \ slid a glove free from her lowleft hand, exposing the chrome fingers beneath,\
  \ “I do have some personal experience with cybernetic prosthetics.” Flexing her\
  \ fingers, she slid back a thumb-sized port on the back of her palm. “Rudimentary\
  \ system scan,” she explained. “My prosthetic has a proprietary Helix Computing\
  \ interface, I’ll log into your software, give it a quick scan, and check the integration\
  \ files to your wetware.”</p> \n     <br clear=\"all\"> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  all\"> \n     <br> \n     <p>Glancing up at Keskodai, Amril asked “What does that\
  \ mean?”</p> \n     <p>The shirren gave a soft shrug, his multifaceted insectile\
  \ eyes seeming to widen in wonder.</p> \n     <p>Carefully, Barsala unwound a small\
  \ connector cable from one of her many pockets, sliding one end into the port on\
  \ her hand. “Don’t worry, it’ll be fine. I’ll go for a manual interface, so it’\
  ll be more secure. Your internal firewall’s up to date?”</p> \n     <p>“I... think\
  \ so?” tried the lashunta, hesitantly, as the biohacker slid the cable into his\
  \ leg’s interface port. “I had a new one installed last week, after the twitching\
  \ started.”</p> \n     <p>“Fascinating,” murmured the kasatha, drumming her fingers\
  \ across a set of hard-light keys on her holographic display. “There’s some redundant\
  \ files here. I can’t see any function for them. Do you have anything stored in\
  \ them?”</p> \n     <p>“Couple of vid shows.” replied Amril. “Don’t look in the\
  \ download section, please. I might have downloaded them illegally.”</p> \n    \
  \ <p>With a few more taps from her three non-interfaced hands, Barsala announced,\
  \ “Scanning now. Wait.” A sharp pause cut her voice silent. Then, glancing at the\
  \ man’s cybernetic leg, she said “This is odd. The files are duplicating.” A second\
  \ hard-light window appeared on the biohacker’s display—quickly joined by another.\
  \ Then another.</p> \n     <p>“Chhk-chhk wants to know if that’s bad.” enquired\
  \ Keskodai. “It looks bad.”</p> \n     <p>A series of digital windows blazed into\
  \ life around Barsala, flaring like a cradle of stars. As they did, Amril’s leg\
  \ shuddered violently, its pistons whirring at a fanatical speed, showering crackling\
  \ sparks across the floor. “We’ve got exponential duplication!” yelled Barsala.\
  \ “These aren’t redundant files—someone’s using them as a back door! Kes, quick—\
  ”</p> \n     <p>Abruptly, Barsala’s hand twisted upward, violently pulling her trailing\
  \ cable from Amril’s port. The biohacker gave a sharp yelp as her cybernetic fingers\
  \ tensed into claws and turned toward her. Violently, her rogue hand lashed out,\
  \ clawing and swiping at her face.</p> \n     <p>“My! This is exciting!” chittered\
  \ Keskodai. “I knew this would be a thrilling field trip. Do you need one of the\
  \ inhibitors?” He asked nonchalantly, scanning a wide array which hung from the\
  \ wall.</p> \n     <p>“The blue one!” called Barsala, latching two free hands around\
  \ her rebellious prosthetic. Her cybernetic hand continued to flail, lashing out\
  \ with her fingertips. She staggered back, wrestling frantically with her hand.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Quickly, Keskodai scooped up a sturdy metal cylinder marked with a blue\
  \ label and hurled it over to the biohacker. Catching it deftly with her last free\
  \ hand, Barsala wrestled her cybernetic hand down onto a cluttered workbench with\
  \ the other two, scattering small vials and tubes. Holding her thrashing, violent\
  \ hand down, she tugged open the interface port once again. “Okay,” she muttered,\
  \ “that should override my biological systems long enough to isolate this thing...”\
  </p> \n     <p>“What is it?” cried Amril, eyes wide in shock.</p> \n     <p>“Offensive\
  \ countermeasure” replied Barsala. “Someone left a sentient computer virus in your\
  \ prosthetic’s firmware.”</p> \n     <p>Amril sat bolt upright, looking down at\
  \ his leg in panic. “A virus?”</p> \n     <p>Rolling up her sleeve, Barsala pushed\
  \ the canister containing the inhibitor against her upper arm. It gave a soft hiss\
  \ as the contents discharged, filling her bloodstream. “It was protecting a backdoor\
  \ into your augment.” She explained, dropping the canister. Her arteries radiated\
  \ a momentary glow. “Know anyone who’d want to hack your systems?” she asked.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“Hacking?” spat Amril. “No! Definitely not! I don’t have any enemies!”\
  \ he paused. “Actually, wait, maybe it might be...”</p> \n     <p>With a series\
  \ of thuds, Barsala’s augmented hand forced itself up from was held. Gritting her\
  \ teeth in agitation, she grunted and grabbed a micro-welding torch. “Right!” she\
  \ declared, crackling it to life. “Time for some surgical reprogramming!”</p> \n\
  \     <p>As she began to rewire the hand’s circuitry in deft, sharp moves, Keskodai\
  \ watched in fascination. “Hmm,” he pondered, tapping a thin claw-tip against his\
  \ chin. “Chhk-chhk wants to know if you can simply eject the hardware.” he asked.\
  \ “If it’s trying to kill you, that is. Perhaps we can take it off and put it in\
  \ a box for now?”</p> \n     <p>“Don’t need to” replied Barsala, her eyes focused\
  \ intently on the work. A small shower of sparks flew from her hand. “I’ve confined\
  \ the virus to a partition of the limb’s memory, which should let me get root access\
  \ to... wait, Chhk-chhk wants to know?”</p> \n     <p>“Ah, yes,” trilled the shirren\
  \ cheerfully. “You see, at this stage in larval development, we’ve formed a telepathic\
  \ bond that’s strong enough for in-depth conversation. In fact, I’d be quite happy\
  \ to discuss—”</p> \n     <p>“Maybe later.” she interrupted, dropping the torch\
  \ onto the workbench, and opening another section of the limb. “I think... yes,\
  \ let me just finish this scan... okay, system’s clear.”</p> \n     <p>Amril rubbed\
  \ his head, his antennas drooping. “Is that it?” he asked. “The virus is gone?”\
  </p> \n     <p>The biohacker slowly let go of her hand and bent each finger to test\
  \ her control of her prosthetic, looking carefully for signs of any malicious intent.\
  \ For a few moments she held her breath. Then, slowly, she gave a sigh of relief.\
  \ “Scan’s clear,” she said. “Virus is gone. I’ve kept a log of if you want to watch\
  \ it. In either case, your leg should be fine now.”</p> \n     <p>Whirling around\
  \ to face her, Amril rubbed his eyes. “That’s... that’s amazing.” he muttered. “\
  Thank you. Thank you so much. It feels a lot better.”</p> \n     <p>Flexing her\
  \ fingers once more, Barsala reached into her pocket to recover her surgical glove.\
  \ “We’ll still need to find out who hacked the limb.” She announced. “You’re quite\
  \ sure you don’t have any enemies?”</p> \n     <p>Clapping his hands together, Amril\
  \ inhaled. “Well, maybe that wasn’t quite true. Y’see...”</p> \n     <p>A heavy\
  \ thud echoed through the laboratory. Somewhere in the distance, the ever-present\
  \ hum of the power systems fell abruptly silent. The lab’s internal lights shuddered\
  \ to darkness, replaced with the ghostly glow of emergency red illumination. “What?”\
  \ snapped the biohacker.</p> \n     <p>“Okay,” admitted Amril, “so, I didn’t want\
  \ to mention it, but I’m part of a group of hackers...”</p> \n     <p>Keskodai held\
  \ up a hand. “Don’t want to interrupt” he said, “but I can sense six minds moving\
  \ towards us. They seem... hostile. Friends of yours?”</p> \n     <p>“No!” yelled\
  \ Amril, glancing around the room. “Okay, look, so we were sniffing around some\
  \ corporate files, and...”</p> \n     <p>A heavy thud echoed from the other side\
  \ of the laboratory’s door.</p> \n     <p>Barsala sighed, shaking her head, and\
  \ calmly started to load her needler pistol. “And this was meant to be my weekend\
  \ off.”</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p style=\"font-weight: bold; line-height:\
