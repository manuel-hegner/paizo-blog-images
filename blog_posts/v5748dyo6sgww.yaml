  \ cutter burned through the robot’s cranial plating. On the makeshift workbench,\
  \ the bot twitched and shook, servos seizing as batteries failed and crucial fluids\
  \ leaked from the wreckage of the robot’s lower body. The cranial plate popped open,\
  \ revealing crystalline arrays and circuit boards blackened by discharge from misfiring\
  \ neural processes.</p> \n     <p>“Ah, scrap!” He dropped the cutter and stretched\
  \ a hand out toward the drone hovering just over his shoulder. “Scout—soldering\
  \ iron! Now!” </p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/091219_Quig.jpg\"\

  \ by Rodrigo Gonzalez Toledo</p> \n     </div> \n     <p>The robot on the slab jerked\
  \ again, and Quig leaned forward, pressing it down with his body so it couldn’t\
  \ damage itself further. “Come on, buddy,” he whispered. “Stay with me...”</p> \n\
  \     <p>Obozaya glanced over, scaled snout wrinkling in confusion over the barrel\
  \ of her rifle. “What’s the big deal? It’s just a robot.”</p> \n     <p>Iseph’s\
  \ head whipped around from where they crouched next to an engineering screen in\
  \ the station wall. “Excuse me?” The android’s words were dangerously flat. “Did\
  \ you just—”</p> \n     <p>Navasi stepped smoothly between them. “I’m sure Obozaya\
  \ didn’t mean it like that, Iseph. Obo, the authorization codes in this robot are\
  \ the only way to access the station’s data core and locate the black ops facility.\
  \ Without those coordinates, this mission is dead. Along with about a million Akitonians.”\
  \ She turned toward the operating table. “How we doing, Quig?”</p> \n     <p>“I’\
  m trying!” Quig drew a line of solder, crudely rerouting power around a glitching\
  \ processor. The robot’s left eye telescoped outward with a whir, thrashing wildly.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“Try harder. Obo, what’s on the scopes? How far out is our pursuit?”\
  </p> \n     <p>Obozaya consulted her datapad, scanning quickly. “Two ships, running\
  \ dark—no transponders, but they’re probably Norikama dropships. One minute from\
  \ rendezvous. Looks like they’re planning to skip the airlocks and come straight\
  \ through the hull.”</p> \n     <p>“And after we rigged up those mines, too! Damn.\
  \ That’s a waste of good ordnance.” Navasi looked out the viewport, toward the twin\
  \ shadows of the approaching ships. “Two of those assault teams is two too many.\
  \ We’ve got to pull back to the ship and cast off before—”</p> \n     <p>The robot\
  \ on the packing crate jerked upright, glowing eyes staring blankly.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>“Security codes verified.” Its voice fuzzed and crackled. “Facility access\
  \ approved. Location 28.735, 98.302.” Then it slumped back onto the operating table,\
  \ sparks and twitches ceasing.</p> \n     <p>“No!” Quig grabbed the robot’s head,\
  \ jerking it up to stare into its dull, extinguished eyes. “No, no, no!” He poked\
  \ frantically at the exposed circuitry of the robot’s metal skull. </p> \n     <p>“\
  That was it! The coordinates!” Navasi’s face broke into a victorious grin—then fell\
  \ just as quickly. She glanced around the room. “Uh... did anyone get that?”</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“Um.” Obozaya looked back and forth between Navasi and the robot. “\
  It started with a 2...?”</p> \n     <p>Navasi put her head in her hands. “Oh for\
  \ the love of—”</p> \n     <p>“28.735, 98.302.” Iseph didn’t even look up from their\
  \ wall panel as they flicked away warnings and error codes.</p> \n     <p>Obozaya\
  \ gaped at the android. “You memorized it? Just like that?”</p> \n     <p>“My brain\
  \ is one of the most advanced neural networks in the Pact Worlds.” Now Iseph turned\
  \ to meet her gaze. “While yours is a glob of pudding evolved to run from predators\
  \ that went extinct millennia ago.” The android returned their attention to the\
  \ screen. “Not to mention currently fifty percent drugs by volume.”</p> \n     <p>“\
  Hey!” Obozaya’s hand went instinctively to the armor pouch where she carried her\
  \ nose-hookah. “Dragon’s breath is an honored Veskarium tradition. I only—”</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“Save it!” Navasi drew her pistols. “You can light up once we’re safely\
  \ in the Drift. We need to get back to the ship before—” </p> \n     <p>A hollow\
  \ boom echoed through the station, shaking the decking beneath their feet. Navasi\
  \ winced. </p> \n     <p>“That’s it, then. Iseph, you got the reactor overrides\
  \ rigged?”</p> \n     <p>“Aye, Captain.” Iseph straightened, swiping a hand over\
  \ the panel and turning the screen dark. “Failsafes are linked to my coms. One touch,\
  \ containment goes down and this station becomes a short-lived star.”</p> \n   \
  \  <p>“Perfect. Let’s move.” Navasi started toward the door, then stopped short.\
  \ “Quig?”</p> \n     <p>The ysoki scrambled to strap the limp robot to the back\
  \ of his pack, stuffing severed metal appendages into pockets. “Help me get Buddy!”\
  </p> \n     <p>“The robot doesn’t matter anymore, Quig! We already got the coordinates.”\
  </p> \n     <p>Quig looked at her like she’d just suggested he light his tail on\
  \ fire, eyes wide behind his mask. “We can't just leave him here!” He looked down\
  \ at the ruined robot. “Not after he helped us!”</p> \n     <p>Navasi rolled her\
  \ eyes. Behind her, Iseph gazed at Quig with a thoughtful expression.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>“Fine,” Navasi snapped. “But you’re carrying it. Obo, cover the rat. Iseph,\
  \ you take point. Let’s go, people!”</p> \n     <p>They ran back through the derelict\
  \ station’s halls. Emergency lighting flickering, illuminating walls scarred and\
  \ streaked with the remnants of their battles. Quig huffed under the new weight\
  \ of his pack, looking up enviously as Scout buzzed through the air in front of\
  \ him, wondering if maybe he should have designed a drone capable of hauling more\
  \ gear. </p> \n     <p>They rounded a corner, the docking bay coming into view.\
  \ Quig had just a moment to register the swarm of red dots dancing across the wall\
  \ ahead of them, and then all hell broke loose.</p> \n     <p>“Contact!” Iseph dove\
  \ forward as a hail of bullets and the bright lines of energy weapons sliced through\
  \ the air between them and Navasi. Quig turned and found an assault team in matte\
  \ black body armor leapfrogging forward down a side corridor, their advance smooth\
  \ and practiced, helmets a faceless, insectile cluster of lenses. </p> \n     <p>Obozaya\
  \ swung around the edge of the hallway, autotarget rifle barking, forcing the intruders\
  \ to take cover.</p> \n     <p>“Run!” Navasi sprinted toward the ship, Quig and\
  \ Iseph hot on her heels. Behind them, Obozaya’s rifle went silent, spent magazine\
  \ clinking against the decking. Then she was bringing up the rear, booted feet pounding.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Something roared. An unseen wave slammed Quig forward, sending him tumbling\
  \ tail over whiskers. He scrambled out from beneath the crushing weight of a mountain\
  \ of fallen metal, only to realize it was Obozaya, her heavy armor having protected\
  \ them both from the grenade blast. They lurched to their feet, Quig snatching up\
  \ his fallen pack.</p> \n     <p>It was too light. He looked back toward the blast’\
  s point of origin. </p> \n     <p>The robot lay in the middle of the hallway, surrounded\
  \ by steam from burst pipes and the sinister hiss of venting atmosphere.</p> \n\
  \     <p>“Buddy!” Quig started toward the fallen bot, but Obozaya grabbed the top\
  \ of his pack and lifted him off his feet, carrying him backward toward the ship.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Behind them, red targeting lasers sliced through the steam.</p> \n \
  \    <p>They slid through the airlock, barely missing Iseph where the android knelt\
  \ in the entrance, calmly laying down covering fire with their sniper rifle. The\
  \ second they were aboard, the door whirred closed, and Quig was almost knocked\
  \ off his feet a second time as Navasi goosed the thrusters.</p> \n     <p>Then\
  \ they were free, ship gliding silently away. Quig staggered to the nearest viewport,\
  \ looking out at the abandoned station as it shrank rapidly with distance. </p>\
  \ \n     <p>“Iseph,” Navasi said. “Light ’em up.”</p> \n     <p>Iseph nodded and\
  \ tapped their datapad.</p> \n     <p>The station erupted. The silent fireball expanded\
  \ too quickly for Quig’s eyes to follow, engulfing the station and the enemy ships.\
  \ The viewport dimmed automatically, shields maximizing to block the blaze of radiation.\
  \ Yet almost as quickly, the glow faded, ionized gasses dispersing into vacuum.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>It was like Iseph had said: A temporary sun, shining bright for one\
  \ brief moment. And then darkness.</p> \n     <p>Quig put a hand to the viewport.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“Goodbye, Buddy,” he whispered. “And thanks.”</p> \n     <div style=\"\
