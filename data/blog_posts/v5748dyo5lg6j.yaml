  >earlier this week we announced our special guests</a>, Frank Mentzer and artist\
  \ Jesper Ejsing. </p> \n     <p>You can view the jam packed PaizoCon 2014 schedule\
  \ <a href=\"/paizocon/events\">here</a>. You'll notice there are two tabs on the\
  \ events page. One is for \"Lottery\" and one is for \"Open Events\". We've also\
  \ got a special page for events that are on-going throughout the convention, like\
  \ our infamous Delves, and events which do not have online sign ups, such as the\
  \ 1-on-1 sessions for editing and fiction writing. We are also happy to announce\
  \ that there are a few new events at PaizoCon 2014 which will have signup on site\
  \ at the convention. <a href=\"/paizocon/specialOngoing\">Check out this page for\
  \ more details!</a></p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p><b>What is the PaizoCon Lottery?</b><br>\
  \ PaizoCon has a ton of events and some have a limited-availability events, including\
  \ games run by Paizo staff members, exhibitors, and special guests. Because there\
  \ are lots of attendees and a limited number of seats, we use a lottery system so\
  \ as many attendees as possible have a chance to get into these games and events.\
  \ </p> \n      <p><b>How does the lottery work?</b><br> Once the preference selection\
  \ deadline passes, the Event Lottery will begin assigning attendees to events, based\
  \ on a random drawing. The lottery works best if you use your actual preferences.\
  \ We know you might love optimization problems, but please donâ€™t try to get fancy.</p>\
  \ \n      <p><b>When is the deadline for selecting my preferences?</b><br> You have\
  \ <b>until 2 PM Pacific time on Monday, June 9</b> to make your PaizoCon Event Lottery\
  \ selections. If you have any trouble selecting your lottery preferences please\
  \ let <a href=\"mailto:paizocon@paizo.com?Subject=PaizoCon%20Lottery%20Problems\"\
  >paizocon@paizo.com</a> know as soon as possible so we can assist you! Once you\
  \ choose your selections, you are done! There is no submit button you need to worry\
  \ about and you can adjust your preferences if needed up until <b>2 PM Pacific time\
  \ on Monday, June 9</b>.</p> \n      <p><b>Am I guaranteed to get into a lottery\
  \ event?</b><br> No. There are a lot of attendees and a limited number of seats,\
  \ not everyone may end up in a lottery event.</p> \n      <p><b>Do I have to have\
  \ a badge already to participate in the lottery?</b><br> Yes! You must have purchased\
  \ or received a <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9354\">regular 3-day badge</a>\
  \ to select preferences for the lottery and register for events.</p> \n      <p><b>What\
  \ happens if an event doesn't fill up after the lottery process has been run?</b><br>\
  \ It will become available for open registration along with the \"Open\" events\
  \ at <b>2 PM Pacific time on Wednesday, June 11</b>.</p> \n     </blockquote> \n\
  \     <p>Happy lottery-ing and hope to see you at PaizoCon!</p> \n     <p>Sara Marie<br>\
