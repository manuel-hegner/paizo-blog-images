  \ <p>Some players love to play monks so they can strive toward enlightenment. Others\
  \ just like to punch stuff!</p> \n    <h2>Monk Features</h2> \n    <p itemprop=\"\
  description\">Monks choose whether their key ability is Strength or Dexterity, which\
  \ will determine the DC of some of their abilities. Their selection of initial proficiencies\
  \ looks pretty different from most classes! First off, they have expert proficiency\
  \ in all their saving throws. Monks aren't trained in any weapons, but they <i>are</i>\
  \ trained in all unarmed attacks. They also get powerful fist, which increases the\
  \ damage die of their fists and lets them make lethal strikes without penalty when\
  \ using normally nonlethal unarmed attacks. Further, they're untrained in armor,\
  \ but get graceful expertise at 1st level, which gives them expert proficiency in\
  \ unarmored defense (everybody else is only trained).</p> \n    <p>They get one\
  \ last class feature at 1st level, of course: Flurry of Blows! This is a single\
  \ action that can be used once per round to make two strikes using an unarmed attack.\
  \ If both hit, their damage is combined. Both these attacks take the multiple attack\
  \ penalty normally, so usually the monk will be making the second attack at a -4\
  \ penalty (since a fist is agile). Flurry of Blows is a huge advantage, letting\
  \ the monk attack up to four times in a round, or letting the monk have plenty of\
  \ actions to move and attack in a single turn. Speaking of moving, at 3rd level,\
  \ a monk gains incredible movement, increasing his speed as long as he's not wearing\
  \ armor. This starts at a 10-foot increase, and it goes up by 5 feet every 3 levels.</p>\

  ></a> \n     <p><i>Illustration by Wayne Reynolds</i></p>\n    </div> \n    <p>Because\
  \ monks can defend themselves in so many different ways, we wanted to let the monk\
  \ pick how his saving throws improve. His saves increase at 7th level through the\
  \ path to perfection class feature, which lets him increase a save's proficiency\
  \ rank to master. The second path to perfection, at 11th level, lets a monk treat\
  \ any successful save as a critical success instead, as long as he has master proficiency\
  \ in that save. The monk gets his third path to perfection at 15th level, which\
  \ he can use to either increase his proficiency rank in another save to master proficiency\
  \ or progress his proficiency at a save in which he's already a master to legendary.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The monk's unarmored defense proficiency also goes up as he levels, first\
  \ to master at 13th level and then to legendary at 17th. You'll notice that monks\
  \ no longer add their Wisdom modifiers to AC, which is due to a few factors. First,\
  \ depending on the monk's Dexterity modifier, the gulf between a heavily armored\
  \ character and a monk without armor is extremely low, so adding even more bonuses\
  \ would put the monk really far ahead. Second, adding more than a single ability\
  \ modifier to a check or DC now really distorts the game. Third, we have another\
  \ role for Wisdom to play in the class, and wanted it to be optional so monks aren't\
  \ dependent on many different ability scores, giving you more flexibility with how\
  \ you can build a monk character.</p> \n    <p>Of course, it goes without saying\
  \ that the monk's unarmed attacks get better as he levels up. Magic strikes, at\
  \ 3rd level, makes the monk's unarmed attacks magical, and increases his proficiency\
  \ rank to expert. At 5th level, metal strikes causes them to be treated as cold\
  \ iron and silver; at 17th level, adamantine strikes makes them act as adamantine.\
  \ Fierce flurry, at 9th level, increases the damage dice of a Flurry of Blows by\
  \ one step whenever both strikes hit. At 19th level, the monk has developed perfected\
  \ form, meaning that when he makes an unarmed attack, he can treat any die roll\
  \ lower than 10 as if he had rolled a 10! This lets the monk plow through weaker\
  \ enemies who can't handle his immaculate fighting style, and against bosses, he\
  \ can even turn a good number of misses into hits.</p> \n    <h2>Monk Feats</h2>\
  \ \n    <p>A monk's feats let him expand how he can attack, teach him special martial\
  \ arts techniques, let him develop an entire fighting style, or use magic called\
  \ ki (which we explain in the Ki section).</p> \n    <p>Your monk could take Monastic\
  \ Weaponry at 1st level, letting him use his unarmed attack proficiencies, as well\
  \ as any monk abilities that normally work with unarmed attacks, with simple and\
  \ martial monk weapons. This is how Sajan gets to use that sweet temple sword! If\
  \ you'd rather stick with punches, kicks, knees, and headbutts, take a look at Brawling\
  \ Focus at 4th level, which gives you the critical specialization effect for anything\
  \ in the brawling weapon group. This means if you critically hit with your unarmed\
  \ attacks, the target might be slowed 1 on its next turn, losing 1 action.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Some of the special attacks you can learn include Stunning Fist, a great\
  \ option if you're looking to recreate your Pathfinder First Edition monk. A Stunning\
  \ Fist strike takes 2 actions and you make an unarmed strike; if the strike deals\
  \ damage, the target has to succeed at a Fortitude save against your class DC (based\
  \ on your Strength or Dex, remember?) or be flat-footed for 1 round, or stupefied\
  \ 2 if it critically fails. So how do you stun the target? If your strike is a critical\
  \ hit, the target's saving throw result is treated as one category worse, and if\
  \ it critically fails its save it's stunned for 1 round! At 4th level, you can pick\
  \ up Deflect Arrow, a reaction that gives you a +4 bonus to AC against a ranged\
  \ weapon attack, or Flying Kick, which lets you use 2 actions to jump and make a\
  \ strike at the end of your jump. You can even Long Jump—normally 2 actions—as part\
  \ of your Flying Kick, potentially moving <i>very</i> far before your strike. Other\
  \ attacks include Ghost Strike, which lets you use 2 actions to target TAC, or Wall\
  \ Run, which lets you run up vertical surfaces at your full Speed.</p> \n    <p>Now\
  \ what about fighting styles? Let's look at one that starts with the Crane Stance\
  \ feat at 1st level! A stance takes one action to enter, and can be used only in\
  \ an encounter. You typically stay in a stance until you enter another stance or\
  \ get knocked out. In Crane Stance, you gain a +1 bonus to AC and get better at\
  \ jumping, but the only Strikes you can make are crane wing attacks. What the heck\
  \ are those? Well, many stances give special unarmed attacks that have statistics\
  \ much like weapons. Crane wing attacks deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage, and have the\
  \ agile, finesse, nonlethal, and unarmed traits. They're not too different from\
  \ normal fist strikes, but others differ more; for instance, heavy dragon tail attacks\
  \ deal 1d10 bludgeoning damage and have the backswing trait instead of agile or\
  \ finesse. What if Crane Stance isn't enough? Well, you can pick up Crane Flutter,\
  \ a reaction that increases your AC against a melee attack and lets you immediately\
  \ riposte with a crane wing strike at a -4 penalty if the triggering attack misses.\
  \ Each of the stances in the <em>Playtest Rulebook</em> has one special attack tied\
  \ to it, but I could see us expanding on them in the future, couldn't you? If you\
  \ really get into stances, you can pick up Master of Many Styles at 16th level,\
  \ which lets you enter a stance as a free action at the start of each of your turns.</p>\
  \ \n    <h2>Ki</h2> \n    <p>Oh, geez, I'm running long, huh? Let's make this quick.\
  \ You know how I said there's a role for Wisdom? Well, that's where ki powers come\
  \ into play. And when I say powers, I mean powers—they're spells just like other\
  \ powers (such as the wizard's school powers or the cleric's domain powers). You\
  \ gain access to ki by picking up the first ki power feat, Ki Strike, which gives\
  \ you a pool of Spell Points equal to your Wisdom modifier, which you can spend\
  \ to cast <i>ki strike</i>. This power is a Verbal Casting free action you can use\
  \ when making an unarmed strike to get a +1 bonus to your attack roll. So you let\
  \ out a shout and hit better!</p> \n    <p>Now that you have Spell Points, you can\
  \ expand your repertoire of powers to teleport with Abundant Step, fire a cone of\
  \ force with a Ki Blast, or kill someone with Quivering Palm. Quivering Palm costs\
  \ 2 Spell Points, and as with the monk's other Spell Point abilities, taking the\
  \ 16th-level feat to get this spell increases your Spell Point pool by 2. Let's\
  \ take a look, and then I'm outta here (probably flying away using the <i>wind jump</i>\
  \ power)!</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-title\">Quivering\
  \ Palm <span class=\"stat-block-cr\">Power 8</span></p> \n     <p>Attack, Necromancy<br>\
  \ <b>Casting</b> [[A]] Somatic Casting, [[A]] Verbal Casting<br> <b>Duration</b>\
  \ 1 month</p> \n     <p>Make a melee unarmed Strike, dealing damage normally. If\
  \ you succeed and the target is alive, anytime during the duration you can spend\
  \ a Verbal action to speak a word of death that could instantly slay it, depending\
  \ on its Fortitude save.</p> \n     <p><b>Success</b> The target survives, the spell\
  \ ends, and the target is bolstered against it.<br> <b>Failure</b> The target is\
  \ stunned for 1 round but survives. The spell's duration continues, but the target\
  \ is bolstered against being killed by <i>quivering palm</i> for 24 hours.<br> <b>Critical\
  \ Failure</b> The target dies.</p> \n     <p>If you cast <i>quivering palm</i> again,\
  \ any previous <i>quivering palm</i> you had cast ends.</p> \n    </blockquote>\
