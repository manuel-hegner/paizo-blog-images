  description\">Some of Golarion's greatest heroes hail from not one world but two,\
  \ caught between dueling cultures and impulses, and it's your turn to become one\
  \ of them! <i>Bastards of Golarion</i> is due out soon, and this is one Player Companion\
  \ you won't want to miss. Here are five reasons why:</span></p> \n     <ul> \n \
  \     <li><b>Half-Elves and Half-Orcs</b>: Readers have been asking for a book on\
  \ these unusual races for years, and <i>Bastards of Golarion</i> makes such wishes\
  \ a reality. Numerous details and expanded flavor provide inspiration for these\
  \ mixed-blooded adventurers and inform players how their half-elf or half-orc character\
  \ may interact with others in the world of Golarion. Oh, and did I mention a flurry\
  \ of new traits and rules options for each of these races?</li> \n      <li><b>Regional\
  \ Variants</b>: The half-human child of a Snowcaster elf is sure to be different\
  \ than that of an elf from Kyonin, and the same can be said for desert orcs from\
  \ Osirion versus orcs from the Hold of Belkzen. All-new details on ten (five for\
  \ half-elves, five for half-orcs) of these half-blooded variants breathe life into\
  \ your game and allow for a bevy of new character choices. New alternative racial\
  \ traits make sure the rules represent your unique character, whether she be descended\
  \ from the jungle orcs of southern Garund or the mysterious elves of the Mordant\
  \ Spire.</li> \n      <li><b>Character Themes</b>: Half-elves and half-orcs aren't\
  \ the only people of Golarion to come from unusual or dubious origins. Even seemingly\
  \ unassuming humans can be bastards given the right backstory! Four diverse character\
  \ themes in this book provide inspiration for an infinite number of characters and\
  \ stories. Whether your character calls himself a bastard or a celebrity, an outcast\
  \ or an unfortunate, these character themes and related rules options shine a light\
  \ on previously unenviable origin stories and show how such characters can rise\
  \ from regret to resplendence!</li> \n      <li><b>Half-Race Hometowns</b>: You've\
  \ decided your bastardly adventurer's race and background story, but where did this\
  \ character even come from? Information on Averaka—the city of half-orcs—and Erages—\
  haven for half-elves—make sure your bastard's hometown is as fleshed out as she\
  \ is. Regional traits and archetypes for characters from either of these unique\
  \ locales tie your character's formidable past to her heroic present.</li> \n  \
  \    <li><b>Build-A-Bastard</b>: In addition to details and traits for bastards\
  \ of unusual origins (such as the strange gillmen of Absalom or the half-hag changelings\
  \ from northern Avistan), the last few pages of this book provide suggestions and\
  \ rules for creating characters whose racial ancestry is perhaps less obvious or\
  \ more distant. Ever wanted to play a human character that's actually 1/8th orc\
  \ and 1/8th dhampir? This book shows you how.</li> \n     </ul> \n     <div class=\"\

  \ \n     <p>And because I would be remiss to write a blog post about this book without\
  \ including some of its some juicy art, here are two of my favorite pieces to tide\
