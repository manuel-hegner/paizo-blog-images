  >As the cold and stormy start of 2008 settled on the Paizo offices, there was a\
  \ palpable sense of tension. We were well past the point where we normally assigned\
  \ freelance writing for our Gen Con releases. Wizards of the Coast was set to release\
  \ Dungeons &amp; Dragons 4th Edition at that show, and we were already planning\
  \ out Second Darkness, the Pathfinder Adventure Path launching at the same time.\
  \ If we were going to switch it to 4E, we needed to do it soon. But we knew little\
  \ more about 4E in January than we did at the previous year's Gen Con. Early in\
  \ the month, Wizards held a conference call with a host of third-party publishers\
  \ telling us that they were working on a new third-party license and that we would\
  \ probably have early access to the rules soon, but the lack of a firm commitment\
  \ or any kind of schedule from Wizards was stretching our patience—and our deadlines.</span></p>\
  \ \n     <p>We were going to have to start writing Second Darkness for 3.5. If Wizards\
  \ came through quickly, we thought, there was a slim chance that we might still\
  \ be able to rework it for 4th Edition... but the more we thought about the logistics\
  \ of learning a new game system, bringing our freelancers up to speed on that system,\
  \ and then having to develop adventures for a system we'd never even played, it\
  \ soon became obvious that even if Wizards started to open up the lines of communication\
  \ immediately, doing Second Darkness as a 4E product was a fool's errand. So as\
  \ we turned to February, we made the difficult decision to commit to 3.5 for Second\
  \ Darkness. Our flagship product line would be incompatible with the then-current\
  \ edition of D&amp;D for at least 6 months.</p> \n     <p>But that didn't yet mean\
  \ that 4th Edition was out of the running for the Adventure Path after that one.\
  \ The continued lack of information of any sort was driving us nuts, and having\
  \ just had our whole company turned upside down due to Wizards' decision to end\
  \ the magazine licenses, we were beginning to think that forging our own path forward\
  \ might be a valid choice. With no license from Wizards in hand, it was unclear\
  \ whether there actually <i>was</i> any other choice. Nevertheless, we dutifully\
  \ sent Jason Bulmahn to Wizards' D&amp;D Experience in Fort Wayne, Indiana that\
  \ February. Jason's mission was to learn as much as he could about 4th Edition,\
  \ play it as much as he could, and report back with his findings. From that, we\
  \ would ultimately make a decision that could make or break us. The tension was\
  \ agonizing. I could barely sleep at night as my mind wrestled with the options.\
  \ If we made the wrong decision, it could very well mean the end of Paizo.</p> \n\
  \     <p>When Jason returned from D&amp;D Experience, he laid out all the information\
  \ that he had gleaned. From the moment that 4th Edition had been announced, we had\
  \ trepidations about many of the changes we were hearing about. Jason's report confirmed\
  \ our fears—4th Edition didn't look like the system we wanted to make products for.\
  \ Whether a license for 4E was forthcoming or not, we were going to create our own\
  \ game system based on the 3.5 SRD: The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. And we were\
  \ already WAY behind schedule.</p> \n     <p>Thankfully, Jason had started to experiment\
  \ with an alternative 3.5 rules system in Fall 2007. It was initially a lark that\
  \ Jason was hoping he might be able to sell as a PDF somewhere down the road to\
  \ the inevitable fans of the 3.5 ruleset that weren't going to 4E. He had dubbed\
  \ the project Mon Mothma. Early in 2008, Jason had presented this document to us,\
  \ a revision that added a variety of new options to a ruleset we already had experience\
  \ and comfort with. Knowing the future was uncertain, we encouraged him to start\
  \ turning his ideas into a complete, coherent rules set.</p> \n     <p>When Jason\
  \ brought in his refined version of Mon Mothma, we liked what we saw. We knew that\
  \ we needed to let our customers know about our decision as soon as possible, but\
  \ it would take at least a year to wrangle a new game system into place, even one\
  \ using existing rules as its basis. But we needed our customers to stick around\
  \ for that year, so we came up with a cunning plan: if we could get people playtesting\
  \ our new system, perhaps they would stick with us through the interim. And, of\
  \ course, all that playtesting would certainly improve the finished product! It\
  \ was a bold plan that seemed almost impossible as we started planning in late February.\
  \ Jason felt that it would take him at least three months to wrangle a playtest\
  \ document into shape, but we couldn't wait until May or June to make our announcement.\
  \ So we decided to break our Alpha playtest into three different documents that\
  \ we would release one per month starting in March. The first section of the playtest\
  \ was pretty much ready to go, so we picked a date of March 18 to spill the beans.</p>\

  \ Day!\n     </div> \n     <p>On the appointed morning, we took the website down\
  \ and put up a <a href=\"/nostore-goblins\">graphic of a bunch of goblins running\
  \ amok with torches</a>. The caption beneath the picture read, \"Goblins have taken\
  \ over Paizo and are forcing a decision. Stay tuned.\" Meanwhile, behind the scenes,\
  \ we were putting up blogs, adding Pathfinder RPG announcements and FAQs, readying\
  \ the first Alpha playtest download, and building new messageboard forums to discuss\
  \ it all. When the website went live, we all held our breath to see what folks would\
  \ say. Of course, a number of people called it a stupid decision and predicted our\
  \ demise, but a large majority of our customers seemed very happy with our decision.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The Alpha playtest was well received, and over the next couple months,\
  \ we made good on our promise to release the next two parts of the playtest document.\
  \ And while Jason read through thousands upon thousands of playtest comments, he\
  \ was also on deadline to create the Beta playtest. To say that he looked a little\
  \ harried during this time is an understatement.</p> \n     <p>The Alpha playtests\
  \ were relatively small, but the Beta was shaping up to be about 400 pages. We realized\
  \ that people would be paying a lot to print that many pages out, so we came up\
  \ with another crazy idea—what if we printed the <i>Pathfinder RPG Beta</i> as a\
  \ softcover book and sold it at Gen Con and on paizo.com? To the best of our knowledge,\
  \ nobody had ever done that before, but since we were swinging for the fences anyways,\
  \ we figured, why not? Of course, that meant we had about a month to put together\
  \ a 400-page book so it could be printed and shipped to Gen Con. Now THAT was crazy.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>In May, we announced that Monte Cook would be joining the Pathfinder\
  \ RPG design team as a consultant. Since Monte had been a part of the D&amp;D Third\
  \ Edition design team, we thought it would be great for Jason to bounce ideas off\
  \ him and to have him explain what the designers were thinking when they wrote certain\
  \ rules. It also didn't hurt to have somebody of Monte's stature signed on to the\
  \ project.</p> \n     <p>We released the <i>Pathfinder RPG Beta</i> at Gen Con,\
  \ and the flood of people buying it was amazing. People bought stacks of copies\
  \ for their entire gaming group. We sold out in the middle of the show. Over the\
  \ next several months, more than 50,000 people joined the playtest, mostly by way\
  \ of the free PDF. The open playtest proved to be invaluable, letting us avoid some\
  \ bad design choices and implementing some good ideas into the final product. It\
  \ was so successful that we've done one for every Pathfinder RPG release that has\
  \ a significant section of new rules.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb180\">\n    \

  \     </div> \n     <p>As if we didn't have enough crazy in our lives, we decided\
  \ that we need to take our Pathfinder campaign setting to the next level. We released\
  \ the <a href=\"/products/btpy82t7\"><i>Pathfinder Chronicles Gazetteer</i></a>\
  \ early in the year as a player-friendly 64-page introduction to the setting, but\
  \ to truly cover the entire Inner Sea region, we'd need a much heftier tome. So\
  \ we put the <a href=\"/products/btpy84eo\"><i>Pathfinder Chronicles Campaign Setting</i></a>\
  \ hardcover on the schedule for Gen Con. In order to get it out on time, editor\
  \ Mike McArtor had to wrangle 28 different authors, each of whom was given a country\
  \ or two to flesh out. Because of the variety of authors and the speed with which\
  \ the book was made, a number of things snuck into the early campaign setting that\
  \ we later needed to adjust, but all in all, the book ended up being great, and\
  \ it sold out upon release at Gen Con.</p> \n     <p>Our Adventure Path line stayed\
  \ in Varisia for all of 2008, through the Curse of the Crimson Throne and Second\
  \ Darkness adventure paths. Partly, this was because Varisia is the part of our\
  \ setting that's closest to the baseline fantasy assumptions, and that's where we\
  \ needed to stand as we built our brand and tried to keep customers from fleeing\
  \ to a new edition. Also, since the campaign setting hardcover wasn't coming out\
  \ until the middle of the year, we hadn't fleshed out the rest of Golarion yet.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>In 2008, we also launched a new bimonthly product line, the Pathfinder\
  \ Companion. To pull this off, we adjusted our Module line to bimonthly as well,\
  \ alternating with Companions. The genesis of the Companion line was a wish to provide\
  \ players with regular material that they could use for their game—something that\
  \ <i>Dragon</i> magazine used to do. Our first product in this line was the <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy84en\"><i>Second Darkness Player Companion</i></a>, and before the\
  \ year was done, we added Companions for <a href=\"/products/btpy85el\"><i>Elves\
  \ of Golarion</i></a> and <a href=\"/products/btpy86j7\"><i>Osirion, Land of Pharaohs</i></a>.</p>\

  \ \"He-Looks-JUST-Like-His-Avatar\" McArtor with a Fan Appreciation Award at the\
  \ inaugural PaizoCon!\n     </div> \n     <p>2008 wasn't just a year for new books.\
  \ In February, we crowned the first RPG Superstar champion. German Christine Schneider\
  \ took home the win with her proposal for Clash of the Kingslayers, beating out\
  \ hundreds of novice designers, many of whom ended up writing for Paizo, or even\
  \ getting hired onto our staff! In addition to Christine, future Pathfinder stalwarts\
  \ Clinton Boomer, Rob McCreary and Jason Nelson were also in the top 4, with contender\
  \ Russ Taylor also becoming a valuable contributor and Ross Byers later winding\
  \ up on Paizo's web team! All in all, it was a great start for our quest to find\
  \ new talent for Paizo.</p> \n     <p>In the early part of the summer, another Paizo\
  \ tradition was started: PaizoCon! Local customer and friend of the company Tim\
  \ Nightingale decided to bring Paizo fans together at a hotel in Bellevue to play\
  \ games and talk about Paizo and Pathfinder. He dubbed the get-together PaizoCon,\
  \ and about 50 attendees turned up. Paizo staffers showed up on the Saturday of\
  \ the con to hold a couple of seminars and run a few celebrity games. We adopted\
  \ PaizoCon from Tim the following year, and it's now one of our most important conventions\
  \ each year. From humble beginnings rises greatness!</p> \n     <p>Another milestone\
  \ for summer 2008 was the launch of Pathfinder Society organized play at Gen Con.\
  \ We dubbed the first year Season Zero because we wanted to use it like an open\
  \ playtest, working with players and GMs to refine the system, with a formal Season\
  \ One planned to launch alongside our new RPG in 2009. The Pathfinder Society room\
  \ at Gen Con was packed, with four scenarios offered for play. Over the weekend,\
  \ 400 characters were made and 600 registration cards were handed out for new players\
  \ and GMs. Today, many thousands of GMs and players make Pathfinder Society a large\
  \ part of their gaming lives.</p> \n     <table align=\"center\">\n      <tbody>\n\

  \     <h2>Coming Home</h2> \n     <p>By 2008, my path in the gaming industry had\
  \ taken an odd turn. I had time at TSR, Wizards of the Coast, Interplay, and Upper\
  \ Deck under my belt. I already had a working relationship with Wes Schneider and\
  \ James Jacobs from writing Greyhawk god articles for <i>Dragon</i>, an occasional\
  \ adventure for <i>Dungeon</i>, and Golarion god articles for the Adventure Paths.\
  \ I knew Erik from his dedicated involvement with Greyhawk (and from when he was\
  \ one of my TSR online volunteers), and Lisa was my first boss in Wizards of the\
  \ Coast RPG R&amp;D for Team Greyhawk. So when I found myself unemployed after Upper\
  \ Deck's most popular card game had a poor quarter, I emailed Erik to let him know\
  \ I'd be available for more freelance. Erik countered by offering me a full-time\
  \ job at Paizo. Developer Mike McArtor was leaving, and Erik needed someone to take\
  \ over that role. (Mike was also one of my TSR volunteers from years before, and\
  \ had asked to use me as a reference when he applied for the developer job at Paizo).\
  \ I had never officially done any development before, but Erik assured me that I\
  \ could do this job, so I accepted.</p> \n     <p>My move from San Diego back to\
  \ Seattle was delayed for three weeks by my sister's wedding, but right after that\
  \ I shipped my books, gave away my not-worth-moving furniture, and loaded up the\
  \ car with my four cats and the rest of my belongings for a mad, three-day drive\
  \ through a heat wave and northern California wildfires to reach my beloved Emerald\
  \ City. In many ways, that period of my life was a significant reboot—work, home,\
  \ relationships, finances, and motivations all changed radically in a span of about\
  \ six weeks, in many ways very reminiscent of my decision 13 years earlier to leave\
  \ California and move to Wisconsin to work for TSR.</p> \n     <p>I started at Paizo\
  \ the day after I arrived in Seattle. The team was great. The energy was great.\
  \ The company was still struggling financially, but I could see everyone's heart\
  \ was in the work, and they were proud of what they were doing. I had my own cubicle\
  \ in the editorial pit, with most of my desk obscured with rulebooks and minis,\
  \ and felt right at home with the toys, posters, and dinosaurs decorating the other\
  \ cubes. I wrangled freelancers, developed manuscripts, wrote art orders, and learned\
  \ how to fiddle with text in layout. As a developer, I was able to influence more\
  \ projects than I ever would have time to write myself. As it turns out, I had missed\
  \ working on RPGs, and actually missed having real deadlines—even if we were behind\
  \ on some of them. I went to Gen Con with Paizo and saw the Pathfinder RPG Beta\
  \ sell out—a sign that the gaming community felt we were doing the right thing.\
  \ It felt really good to be a part of Paizo. It reminded me of the best times at\
  \ TSR and Wizards of the Coast. It was good to have that feeling again. As someone\
  \ who has witnessed many of the highs and lows of the modern gaming industry, I'm\
  \ glad to be at Paizo, and I wouldn't choose anywhere else.</p> \n     <p>Sean K\
  \ Reynolds<br> <i>Designer</i></p> \n     <h2>From the Editor's Desk</h2> \n   \
  \  <p>My road to Paizo was, I think, a bit unique. I first heard of Paizo not from\
  \ its array of gaming products but rather from its revival of the old pulp Planet\
  \ Stories banner in 2007. I was curious. Not only was someone bringing back into\
  \ print the sword-and-planet classics of Leigh Brackett, C. L. Moore, and Michael\
  \ Moorcock, but that someone also happened to be based only a few miles away from\
  \ me. After determining that the Paizo folks made up the same team who'd up until\
  \ recently published <i>Amazing Stories</i>, I filed away the info and continued\
  \ to work on my labor of love, a historical fantasy novel called <i>The Song of\
  \ Kwasin</i>, coauthored with science-fiction luminary Philip José Farmer.</p> \n\
  \     <p>By spring 2008, I'd completed the novel and was looking for both a publisher\
  \ and a job. As the pulpsters of old might say, Fate struck when I was perusing\
  \ the Norwescon schedule and noticed that Erik Mona, Paizo's Publisher, was going\
  \ to be speaking on a number of panels. A week or so later, I was at the con meeting\
  \ Erik and pitching him my book, an adventure tale that fit right in with the rip-roaring\
  \ spirit of the Planet Stories line. Erik was immediately interested, and we stood\
  \ outside in the hallway chatting it up about the pulps for a good 25 minutes before\
  \ I mentioned I'd applied for the recently listed editor position at Paizo. <i>The\
  \ Song of Kwasin</i> ended up selling to another publishing house, but I'll always\
  \ be thankful for the novel having broken the ice. A few short weeks later, I was\
  \ called in for an interview and an editing test, and a week after that I was working\
  \ furiously at my new desk at the Paizo offices.</p> \n     <p>And I do mean working\
  \ furiously. You see, I came aboard right before both the <i>Pathfinder RPG Beta</i>\
  \ and <i>Pathfinder Chronicles Campaign Setting</i> hardcover were due to go to\
  \ the printer. Printouts from both books were flying in a feverish blur from one\
  \ editor to the next as I was trying my best to raise my voice above the tumult\
  \ working to get everyone on the same page that <i>Chelaxian</i> was a noun and\
  \ <i>Chelish</i> was an adjective. It was a crazy time to board the good ship Paizo,\
  \ but I knew the trial by fire was worth it when I saw just how well both the Beta\
  \ and the Campaign Setting were received. And now, more than four years later, it's\
  \ even more worth it knowing how far Paizo and Pathfinder have come... and how much\
  \ farther we can go.</p> \n     <p>Christopher Carey<br> <i>Editor</i></p> \n  \

  \ and there were few remaining 3.5 hardcover books that needed work. With a bunch\
  \ of idle time on my hands, I was looking for something to keep myself occupied.\
  \ It occurred to me that there might be a fair number of people who would stick\
  \ with the 3.5 rules and that maybe I could put together an easy PDF document with\
  \ some rules revisions, just for fun. My first document had the title \"3.75 Rules\
  \ Set\" in the margin.</p> \n     <p>As the months rolled by, my little rules document\
  \ began to grow. At first, it was just a list of ideas with things like \"fix grapple\"\
  \ and \"do something about turning.\" As those issues got tackled, the document\
  \ got larger and larger. Eventually, it came to include alterations to the core\
  \ classes and a significant revision to combat and monster design. By the end of\
  \ 2007, the \"3.75 Rules Set\" document was about 20 pages long.</p> \n     <p>Early\
  \ in 2008, it was becoming apparent that Paizo was in a bind. We still had not seen\
  \ 4th Edition (or what would become the GSL) and we were starting to run into the\
  \ part of the year where we were supposed to be working on products for Gen Con.\
  \ Realizing that we were running out of time, Lisa called a summit at her house\
  \ to discuss our options. We struggled most of that day to come up with a viable\
  \ plan. I kept thinking back to my rules document, even though it was little more\
  \ than a mishmash of rules ideas and notes. Late in the afternoon, I brought it\
  \ up to the folks in attendance. It took some convincing, and a whole lot of reassurances\
  \ on my part, but I left that meeting as the Lead Designer of \"Mon Mothma,\" the\
  \ code name we gave to the Pathfinder RPG.</p> \n     <p>The next few weeks went\
  \ by in a blur. We knew that we wanted to do a public playtest of the rules, and\
  \ to put out the Beta by Gen Con, so I had very little time to get the first documents\
  \ put together. The timeline gave me about a month to turn my rough rules document\
  \ into the first of the Alpha playtest PDFs. Not only that, but I needed to make\
  \ significant progress on the next two Alpha documents as well, because I would\
  \ need to roll right into the Beta design as soon as the Alpha documents were released.\
  \ I also went to D&amp;D Experience during this time to check out 4th Edition; after\
  \ playing the game, and talking to many of the fans at the show, it became clear\
  \ to me that we were doing the right thing for our fans, our world, and the company.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>I had so little time during this design period that I actually worked\
  \ from home just to save me the travel time getting to the office, giving me an\
  \ extra hour or so each day. On the days I came in, I was expected to update everyone\
  \ on my progress and show off the current design, to get feedback and answer questions.\
  \ There were a lot of insane ideas thrown around back then, some of which eventually\
  \ got changed drastically before finding a home in the Beta and the final version\
  \ of the game. There was once an insanely difficult \"new\" system for determining\
  \ cover, which in retrospect, was a terrible idea. Fighters used to get a number\
  \ of \"combat tricks\" at every level, many of which went on to become feats in\
  \ the final version of the game. But for every misstep, there were dozens of great\
  \ changes that were brought into the rules, like sorcerer bloodlines, combat maneuvers,\
  \ and channel energy. It was a crazy few weeks, and probably some of the most creative\
  \ of my career.</p> \n     <p>Finally, after months of tinkering and a few frantic\
  \ weeks of work, the day had finally arrived: March 18, 2008. The Paizo website\
  \ came down and I spent most of the day pacing the office like an expectant father.\
  \ We ordered pizza. We monitored the unofficial Paizo chat room. We waited and waited\
  \ for the site to come back up with the Pathfinder RPG announcement and the Alpha\
  \ document for all to see. My nerves were a complete wreck. At 3:01 p.m. Pacific\
  \ Time, the site came back up and the Alpha playtest of the Pathfinder RPG went\
  \ live. I spent the next few days and nights glued to my computer, scanning every\
  \ gaming website I could find for feedback, thoughts, and general reaction to the\
  \ announcement. Some called doom, some rejoiced, some simply shrugged, but it quickly\
  \ became clear that from the outpouring support from our messageboards that we had\
  \ one thing going for us.</p> \n     <p>You.</p> \n     <p>You were behind us from\
  \ the moment the goblins forced our decision. You were behind us through the entire\
  \ playtest process, which stretched out almost a year in total. You stood in that\
  \ insane line to get the Beta print version and the <i>Core Rulebook</i> the following\
  \ year. And you are still with us today. You make it all worth it.</p> \n     <p>Jason\
  \ Bulmahn<br> <i>Lead Designer</i></p> \n    </div> \n   </div>\n  </blockquote>\
