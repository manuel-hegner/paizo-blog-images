  \ Retrospective—Year 2 (2004)</h1> \n   <h2>The Worst of Times</h2> \n   <p class=\"\
  date\">Thursday, April 26th, 2012</p> \n   <p class=\"tiny\">This blog entry is\
  \ the third in a series of blogs commemorating Paizo's 10th anniversary.<br><a href=\"\
  /paizo/blog/2012/february/v5748dyo5ld43\">Click here to read the first installment.</a></p>\
  \ \n   <p>As 2004 opened, there was a cloud hanging over Paizo. The reality that\
  \ <i>Star Wars Insider</i> and the <i>Star Wars Fan Club</i> were going away in\
  \ a few short months really hit home. Star Wars accounted for more than half of\
  \ Paizo's revenue, and supporting the company purely on income from <i>Dragon</i>\
  \ and <i>Dungeon</i> wasn't going to work. I personally had two options. The easiest\
  \ would be to shut down the company. As I mentioned in my first anniversary blog,\
  \ it takes a long time to get paid for magazine sales, and while that makes starting\
  \ up a magazine very difficult, it also means that if you stop publishing, money\
  \ keeps coming in for almost a year. It would have taken a while, but eventually,\
  \ we'd have been able to recoup most of the money that Vic and I had invested in\
  \ Paizo.</p> \n   <p>The other, much more daunting option was to try to replace\
  \ that lost revenue. Subscription and advertising revenue would dry up immediately,\
  \ of course, and that would hurt a lot, but we would still be receiving big <i>Star\
  \ Wars Insider</i> newsstand checks for almost a year after our final issue went\
  \ out in April. That gave us some time to ramp up new business to replace the lost\
  \ income. We had already launched <i>Undefeated</i> in 2003, and were hopeful that\
  \ it would start to pick up some of the slack. The other arrow in our quiver was\
  \ the venerable <i>Amazing Stories</i> magazine, which had been included in the\
  \ license along with <i>Dragon</i> and <i>Dungeon</i> when we took over Wizards\
  \ of the Coast's magazine business. <i>Amazing Stories</i> launched in 1926 as the\
  \ world's first magazine dedicated to science fiction. TSR had acquired it in 1982\
  \ and published it for 13 years, putting it on hiatus just a couple of years before\
  \ Wizards acquired TSR. Wizards almost immediately brought <i>Amazing</i> back,\
  \ publishing it for about 3 years before resting it themselves in 2000. We decided\
  \ to try to make it work yet again, with the staff from <i>Star Wars Insider</i>\
  \ mostly moving directly to <i>Amazing</i> and Dave Gross becoming the magazine's\
  \ 16th Editor-in-Chief.</p> \n   <p>This time, we had a slightly different plan.\
  \ <i>Amazing Stories</i> had always focused almost entirely on prose fiction, with\
  \ short stories making up the bulk of each issue. We wanted to continue running\
  \ great original fiction, but we also wanted to cover the rest of sci-fi/fantasy\
  \ genre: movies, TV shows, comics, video games, etc. We were hoping that we could\
  \ make a magazine that appealed to fans of science fiction and fantasy, and that\
  \ the expanded media coverage would make the magazine appealing to a larger advertising\
  \ base.</p> \n   <div class=\"blurb180\">\n    <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/20120426-501st.jpg\"\

  \ at the Star Wars Fan Club Dinner With the Stars.\n   </div> \n   <p>But before\
  \ we relaunched <i>Amazing</i>, we needed to finish up our run on <i>Star Wars Insider</i>\
  \ and the Official Star Wars Fan Club, and we didn't take that job any less seriously\
  \ while our time was running out. In February, we held the first and only Fan Club\
  \ Dinner with the Stars here in Seattle to coincide with Emerald City Comicon. Our\
  \ guests were Michonne Bourriague (Aurra Sing in <i>The Phantom Menace</i>), and\
  \ Amy Allen (Aayla Secura in <i>Attack of the Clones</i> and <i>Revenge of the Sith</i>,\
  \ which hadn't yet been released). In addition to dinner with the guests, attendees\
  \ received a stash of Star Wars merchandise supplied by Paizo and Lucasfilm, and\
  \ a special autographed souvenir photo ticket created just for the event (we still\
  \ have a few of those for sale <a href=\"/products/btpy73dr\">here on paizo.com</a>).</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Paizo's final issue of <i>Star Wars Insider</i> in April revealed Episode\
  \ III villain General Grievous, who had previously only been seen in animated form.\
  \ And as my reign as President of the Official Star Wars Fan Club concluded, I got\
  \ a chance to go down to San Francisco and dig around in the Star Wars product archives,\
  \ which was a real thrill for Vic and me as collectors.</p> \n   <p>With the loss\
  \ of Star Wars, <i>Dragon</i> became king at Paizo, boasting both the largest number\
  \ of subscribers as well as the best newsstand sales. <a href=\"/products/btpy7zvu\"\
  ><i>Dragon</i> #315</a> was the first issue ever published which had support for\
  \ <i>every</i> D&amp;D campaign setting—<i>19</i> of them—from Forgotten Realms\
  \ and Greyhawk to Red Steel and Hollow World. <a href=\"/products/btpy7oka\"><i>Dragon</i>\
  \ #319</a>, coupled with its sister publication <a href=\"/products/btpy7zcw\"><i>Dungeon</i>\
  \ #110</a>, gave 3.5 DMs everything they might need to set a campaign in the world\
  \ of Dark Sun. <a href=\"/products/btpy7ec0\"><i>Dragon</i></a> #320 celebrated\
  \ the 30th anniversary of D&amp;D with one of my favorite pieces of cover artwork\
  \ ever!</p> \n   <div class=\"blurb180\">\n    <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/20120426-Lisa.jpg\"\

  \ designed for the relaunch of <i>Dragon</i>.\n   </div> \n   <p>The biggest news\
  \ for <i>Dragon</i> that year came at Gen Con, in the form of a relaunch that began\
  \ with <a href=\"/products/btpy7ye5\"><i>Dragon</i> #323</a>. We had heard from\
  \ our readers that our issues were often too hit-or-miss for them—with narrow themes\
  \ such as Dark Sun or ninjas, there was always some portion of the audience that\
  \ wouldn't find it useful. And if a large enough group skipped a particular issue,\
  \ we'd lose money on it. So our new goal was to provide something for everyone with\
  \ every issue. Since many of <i>Dragon</i>'s readers were players, we started the\
  \ Class Acts section, which would include a short article for each of the core classes.\
  \ We also put more consideration into balancing the types of articles that made\
  \ up each issue to ensure that we didn't leave anyone out. For the most part, this\
  \ seemed to really work, and <i>Dragon</i>'s sales started to improve.</p> \n  \
  \ <p>With the continuation of the Adventure Path concept we'd launched the previous\
  \ year, things were also looking up for <i>Dungeon</i>. 2004 ended up being one\
  \ of the most important years for the magazine, and its success eventually heralded\
  \ Erik Mona's rise from Editor-in-Chief to Publisher and James Jacobs' rise from\
  \ Associate Editor to Creative Director.</p> \n   <p><a href=\"/products/btpy7ok8\"\
  ><i>Dungeon</i> #111</a> introduced the first-ever adventure for Eberron, and the\
  \ following month saw <i>Dungeon</i>'s most ambitious issue ever: Erik and James\
  \ worked with Gary Gygax and Robert J. Kuntz to revise and expand Kuntz's famous\
  \ Maure Castle superdungeon. This issue also marked the first and only time that\
  \ <i>Dungeon</i> had just one massive adventure packed between the covers.</p> \n\
  \   <div class=\"blurb180\">\n    <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/20120426-UndefeatedCheerleaders.jpg\"\

  \ The Undefeated cheerleaders and the temporary tattoos from Gen Con 2004.\n   </div>\
  \ \n   <p>At Gen Con, <i>Dungeon</i> also had a relaunch with <a href=\"/products/btpy7to0\"\
  >issue #114</a>, with even bigger changes than we'd made in <i>Dragon</i>. First\
  \ off, <i>Polyhedron</i> went away as the companion offering to each <i>Dungeon</i>\
  \ issue. This was significant to Erik especially, as he had come up through the\
  \ ranks as <i>Polyhedron</i>'s Editor-in-Chief, and the magazine held an important\
  \ place in his heart. But readers were making it clear to us that <i>Polyhedron</i>\
  \ was a very divisive feature, and if we wanted to give <i>Dungeon</i> a chance\
  \ to catch up to its more successful brother, <i>Polyhedron</i> had to go.</p> \n\
  \   <p>We also moved <i>Dungeon</i> to a format that featured one low-level, one\
  \ mid-level, and one high-level adventure in each issue. This gave DMs a treasure\
  \ trove of adventure content that ensured there was something that could fit their\
  \ campaigns no matter what levels they were currently playing. In addition to the\
  \ three adventures, Dungeon would now feature new campaign content in each issue.\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy7to0\"><i>Dungeon</i> #114</a> revisited the Isle of Dread\
  \ and saw the start of Monte Cook's \"Dungeoncraft\" and Wil Wheaton's \"Wil Save\"\
  \ columns. It also featured the very popular \"Mad God's Key,\" the first published\
  \ work by Jason Bulmahn. The end of 2004 saw the final adventure in the Shackled\
  \ City Adventure Path and the start of the well-received three-part Greyhawk Istvin\
  \ series.</p> \n   <p><i>Undefeated</i> magazine grew a little bit, finding new\
  \ subscribers and appearing in a few more mass-market outlets. However, we were\
  \ still having trouble getting the traction that we really needed in our key market:\
  \ hobby game stores. At Gen Con, we had Paizo's most controversial promotion ever:\
  \ the <i>Undefeated</i> cheerleaders, who applied <i>Undefeated</i> temporary tattoos\
  \ to con-goers arms. It definitely helped drive traffic to the Paizo booth, even\
  \ if not everyone was happy about us having \"booth babes.\"</p> \n   <div class=\"\

  \    <br> Spider-Man adorns the first Paizo issue of Amazing Stories.\n   </div>\
  \ \n   <p><i>Amazing Stories</i> launched in September, though we offered a sneak\
  \ peek at Gen Con in August. The first issue showed off <i>Amazing</i>'s new look\
  \ with a <i>Spider-Man</i> movie cover. It also had my favorite thing we published\
  \ in Amazing Stories: Dave Gross had devised a column called \"1,000 Words,\" where\
  \ we would provide a writer with a picture, and they would write a story using—\
  you guessed it—1,000 words. Harlan Ellison—er, sorry... \"Harlan Ellison®\"—was\
  \ pegged to write the first installment, but due to a miscommunication, he wrote\
  \ only 100 words. When we pointed out the problem, Harlan befuddled us again by\
  \ turning in... another 100 words. Desperately, we reached out to Neil Gaiman, who\
  \ saved the day by writing a hilarious 800-word introduction to Harlan's 200-word\
  \ story. I couldn't stop laughing!</p> \n   <p>At the end of August, Paizo moved\
  \ into new offices on Richards Road in Bellevue. Located just a few blocks away\
  \ from our first office space, it finally gave us room to give everybody a desk—\
  and most importantly, we actually had warehouse space, and no longer had to stack\
  \ back issues in the hallways (something that had caused many frowns from the fire\
  \ inspector).</p> \n   <p>The biggest change we made at Paizo, though, was largely\
  \ hidden behind the scenes until late in the year. Webmaster Rob Head added programmer\
  \ Gary Teter to our web team, and the two of them spent months building an infrastructure\
  \ that would completely transform paizo.com. Our original website had really been\
  \ little more than a portal to sign up for magazine subscriptions and a place to\
  \ post news releases. In August, we rolled out a new paizo.com complete with messageboards,\
  \ which quickly become home to an incredible community. And in November, we launched\
  \ our e-commerce store selling not just Paizo's own products, but for the first\
  \ time offering thousands of gaming items from hundreds of gaming companies. Our\
  \ first day's sales, on November 24, 2004, weren't earth shattering—in fact, we\
  \ only did $1,124.56 in total sales the first week! (Trivia: the first non-Paizo\
  \ product sold through the site was White Wolf's World of Darkness: Antagonists\
  \ hardcover.) Though it started slow, eventually the paizo.com community and our\
  \ web store would become two of the most important things that keep Paizo running.</p>\

  \ our magazines.\n   </div> \n   <p>We'd also had a few big staffing changes at\
  \ Paizo. After Mary Franklin left the company to join Lucasfilm—where she still\
  \ is today—Jeff Alvarez, who had started only the previous year as a Customer Service\
  \ Representative, was made Director of Operations. Keith Strohm was promoted to\
  \ Chief Operating Officer in August, and in October, Erik Mona was promoted to Editor-in-Chief\
  \ of both <i>Dragon</i> and <i>Dungeon</i>, a well-deserved change of title for\
  \ all of his hard work on <i>Dungeon</i> and <i>Polyhedron</i> that year.</p> \n\
  \   <p>The entire Paizo staff had worked their butts off in 2004, but at the end\
  \ of the year, I was faced with a very tough choice. Even with the launch of <i>Amazing\
  \ Stories</i> and the growth of <i>Dragon</i>, <i>Dungeon</i>, and <i>Undefeated</i>,\
  \ Paizo wasn't even coming close to making up the lost revenue from <i>Star Wars\
  \ Insider</i>. We had finally located the flaws in Johnny Wilson's \"Three-Legged\
  \ Stool\" model of the magazine business (detailed in the \"Debunking the Three-Legged\
  \ Stool\" section below). Our cash reserves were depleted, and I had actually started\
  \ to put some of my retirement money into the company to make ends meet—something\
  \ I had promised myself that I would never do. The stress on me personally was the\
  \ highest that I have ever borne in my 25 years in the industry. I now knew what\
  \ they meant when they said that Conan ruled over Hyboria with a heavy brow. There\
  \ was one particular moment that will forever be etched into my brain: It was a\
  \ Friday in early December, and Vic and I were driving home from the office late\
  \ in the evening. It had been a particularly hard day, with money being tight and\
  \ a bunch of bills going unpaid. I had been agonizing over spreadsheets with sobering\
  \ names like 2005Hardline.xls, 2005BudgetcutUndft.xls, 2005NoAmazing.xls, 2005BudgetSmallSalaries.xls,\
  \ 2005Budgetcutpeople.xls, and 2005Armeggedon.xls.</p> \n   <p>You have to understand,\
  \ the people at Paizo are my friends. And with just a few keystrokes on a spreadsheet,\
  \ I was potentially destroying lives, or at least changing their trajectories forever.\
  \ The stress took over while driving home and I had to pull over to the side of\
  \ the road and started bawling. I knew in my heart that I needed to make some drastic\
  \ changes to give the company a chance to survive. I needed to cut <i>Amazing Stories</i>\
  \ and <i>Undefeated</i> and all of their staffs to give Paizo a chance. But at that\
  \ moment, sitting on the side of the road, I just wanted all of it to end. I turned\
  \ to Vic and said, \"I am done. I can't do this anymore. Let's just close it all\
  \ down. I don't care about the money anymore. I just don't want to feel like this\
  \ each day. I am not strong enough to carry this burden.\" If I had been alone,\
  \ I might just have ended Paizo on that day; I was that low. But Vic picked me up,\
  \ got me talking about the good things we had at Paizo. Got me thinking about how\
  \ this wasn't the end, just a very large bump in the road.</p> \n   <p>But it still\
  \ was a very hard time for me. The first thing I did was lay myself off. There was\
  \ no way that I was going to draw a paycheck if I had to lay off a bunch of my colleagues.\
  \ I would work for free and not get paid again until Paizo was on better footing.\
  \ Then, on December 16, I had to do something that I promised myself I would never\
  \ do: I had to lay off a bunch of people. All told, six people lost their jobs that\
  \ day.</p> \n   <p>At the end of the day, Paizo was a lot leaner and focused. For\
  \ now, we were the <i>Dragon</i> and <i>Dungeon</i> magazine company. But laying\
  \ off six people wasn't magically going to put us on the path to prosperity. There\
  \ was a LOT of hard work to be done in 2005. We needed to start building the foundations\
  \ of an entirely new company.</p> \n   <blockquote> \n    <p><b>Employees who started\

  \ \n   <p class=\"tiny\">*laid off as part of the cancellation of <i>Amazing Stories</i>\
  \ and <i>Undefeated</i></p> \n   <h2>Debunking the Three-Legged Stool</h2> \n  \
  \ <p>In our first anniversary blog, we mentioned Johnny's Wilson's \"three-legged\
  \ stool\" model for magazine publishing, which dictates that successful magazines\
  \ need to garner revenue from three streams: newsstand sales, subscriptions, and\
  \ advertising.</p> \n   <p>Unfortunately, 2004 was the year that we discovered the\
  \ major flaw in Johnny's model.</p> \n   <p>We knew that <i>Undefeated</i> was never\
  \ going to attract a ton of subscribers; instead, we hoped to make most of our money\
  \ on that title by selling to the hobby gaming market which—unlike sales to newsstands—\
  couldn't be returned and was generally finalized within 90 days. We planned to bolster\
  \ that solid, predictable income with advertising revenue from game publishers.</p>\
  \ \n   <p><i>Amazing Stories</i> took the opposite tack. We didn't expect much at\
  \ all in the way of hobby sales, but we hoped to maintain a decent newsstand presence,\
  \ and, over time, build a small-but-loyal subscriber base like we enjoyed with <i>Dragon</i>\
  \ and <i>Dungeon</i>. We hoped to attract advertising from book and comic publishers\
  \ and TV and movie producers.</p> \n   <p>Best of all, we had a shortcut that would\
  \ give <i>Amazing</i> an immediate newsstand presence. Newsstands effectively have\
  \ standing monthly orders for magazines. They may adjust that order from month to\
  \ month, but once they start buying from you, they generally <i>keep</i> buying\
  \ from you. The surprising part is that these standing orders aren't done by magazine\
  \ title, but by something called a bipad. Once you have a bipad, you can actually\
  \ replace one magazine with another, and the standing order will essentially transfer\
  \ to the new title. And our distributor told us that we'd be able to use the <i>Star\
  \ Wars Insider</i> bipad to launch <i>Amazing Stories</i>, so we wouldn't have to\
  \ spend time and money to convince newsstands to pick up the new magazine—it would\
  \ be automatic.</p> \n   <p>In our last blog, we explained that it took over a year\
  \ to get final newsstand sales figures for a particular issue, so it wasn't until\
  \ early 2004 that we had full data on even our first few all-Paizo issues of <i>Dragon</i>,\
  \ <i>Dungeon</i>, and <i>Star Wars Insider</i>. Accountant Dave Erickson and I spent\
  \ a couple of months poring through that data, and we finally emerged with a spreadsheet\
  \ that let us predict sales data for recent issues with a fairly high degree of\
  \ accuracy. Which meant the real analysis could begin.</p> \n   <p>By the end of\
  \ 2004, we finally had enough data to prove that magazines don't actually <i>make</i>\
  \ money from newsstand sales. It turns out that almost all of the costs associated\
  \ with newsstand distribution increase in direct proportion to the number of copies\
  \ you distribute; there are almost no economies of scale to be had. Therefore, increasing\
  \ the number of copies you distribute doesn't increase your margin at all. The only\
  \ way to increase the potential profit on newsstand sales is to increase the magazine's\
  \ sell-through—that's the percentage of magazines that you've actually sold to customers\
  \ once all the returns have been finalized. But it turns out it's virtually impossible\
  \ to improve sell-through in any long-term way.</p> \n   <p>Unlike hobby stores,\
  \ newsstands get to return any magazines they don't sell. This means that there's\
  \ no risk associated with them ordering too many copies. In fact, retailers deliberately\
  \ order more than they expect to sell, for a couple of good reasons. The most obvious\
  \ is that they can't sell magazines they don't have, so ordering more than they\
  \ think they'll need ensures that they'll have copies to sell in case sales are\
  \ better than expected. Less obvious is the fact that it's easy for customers to\
  \ overlook a small stack of magazines on the stand. On a shelf with dozens of different\
  \ titles, a single copy of a particular magazine can literally get lost in the crowd;\
  \ it's harder to overlook a stack of four or five copies. So retailers don't just\
  \ want an extra copy or two on hand‚ they want an extra <i>stack</i> or two. So,\
  \ no matter how many copies you sell in a month, retailers will order more the next\
  \ month, assuring that if your sales continue to be strong, your sell-through percentage\
  \ will stay pretty much the same. And if the next issue proves to be <i>less</i>\
  \ successful, then they'll just return more copies, <i>decreasing</i> your sell-through,\
  \ and the fees associated with the extra printing and the extra returns will likely\
  \ wipe out any extra revenue you may have earned from the previous issue doing so\
  \ well.</p> \n   <p>What is good sell-through, anyway? Anything above 30% was considered\
  \ pretty good in the industry. Our best-ever issues were in the neighborhood of\
  \ 40%. That means that 60% of the issues we printed were destroyed unsold. A bad\
  \ issue would have sell-through in the 10% range. So not only were we sometimes\
  \ paying to print almost nine times as many copies as we actually sold, but we were\
  \ also paying to have all those copies trucked around the country, put out on newsstands,\
  \ removed from newsstands a month later, and then destroyed. Along with, of course,\
  \ a fee to the distributor for tracking all of that activity for us.</p> \n   <p>At\
  \ this point, you may be wondering how all of those other magazines on the newsstand\
  \ survive if none of them make any money. The answer is that those magazines make\
  \ their money almost solely from advertising. (Open up a popular newsstand magazine\
  \ and look at the masthead—that's magazine lingo for the credits page—and you'll\
  \ usually find that the advertising sales staff vastly outnumbers the editorial\
  \ staff.) These magazines are willing to lose <i>piles</i> of money on newsstand\
  \ distribution in order to get people to buy them. The reason is that the more readers\
  \ they have—whether profitable or not—the more they can charge advertisers to reach\
  \ those readers. (This also explains why they often have low, low cover prices that\
  \ don't even cover the cost of printing, or subscription rates that don't even cover\
  \ the cost of postage, much less printing and editorial costs.)</p> \n   <p>But\
  \ specialty magazines like <i>Dragon</i> and <i>Dungeon</i> can't bring in the same\
  \ kinds of ads that those magazines can. They're not going to pull high-revenue\
  \ ads for cars, cigarettes, or designer watches. At best, we might get ads for video\
  \ games or high-profile fantasy novels‚ and those only because of <i>Dragon</i>\
  \ and <i>Dungeon</i>'s strong position in those markets, the result of decades of\
  \ history. <i>Amazing Stories</i> and <i>Undefeated</i> didn't have that going for\
  \ them.</p> \n   <p>Generating ad revenue is a difficult business. Advertisers want\
  \ to know that the money they're spending on advertising results in increased sales.\
  \ But it's usually very hard for advertisers to determine whether their ads are\
  \ bringing them customers. From the publisher's side, we could provide estimates\
  \ of the number of people that were potentially reading the ad, and we could talk\
  \ about the prestige of being in the magazine. We could even tell them how some\
  \ distributors would only carry RPG products that were being advertised in <i>Dragon</i>.\
  \ But we couldn't tell them how much of a return they'd get on their investment.\
  \ And as the internet became a more viable—and more measurable—means of spreading\
  \ the word and selling products, magazine ad sales became harder and harder to do.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Worse still, even when we <i>did</i> manage decent ad sales, actually\
  \ getting paid was a difficult prospect. Leaf through a bunch of old <i>Dragon</i>\
  \ magazines, and you'll find loads of ads from game publishers and game stores that\
  \ aren't in business anymore. In many cases, those folks were already in trouble\
  \ when their ads were in print, and paying us was among the least of their worries.\
  \ Now, look at some of those full-page ads from big companies... would it surprise\
  \ you to learn that many of them didn't bother paying us either? The only recourse\
  \ we had to keep people paying was that we wouldn't run more of their ads until\
  \ their accounts were paid up—but if companies decided they didn't really <i>need</i>\
  \ to advertise with us, we were just out of luck. Eventually, we required advertisers\
  \ to secure ad placements with credit cards, and that helped eliminate most of the\
  \ deadbeats—but it also reduced the number of people willing to place ads with us.\
  \ Couple that with the start of a recession, where advertising is among the first\
  \ things to drop from a company's budget, and you have a very difficult business\
  \ indeed.</p> \n   <p>Now recall that our intent for <i>Amazing Stories</i> was\
  \ to make its money on the newsstand and from advertising, and that we had the benefit\
  \ of the <i>Star Wars Insider</i> bipad to launch <i>Amazing</i>. Well, shortly\
  \ before launch, we learned that we had been misinformed about the bipad. We'd have\
  \ been able to use the bipad if <i>Insider</i> had ceased publication, but because\
  \ it was simply going to another publisher, the bipad had to go with it. That left\
  \ us needing to spend months upon months and thousands upon thousands of dollars\
  \ to build up an unprofitable newsstand presence from scratch, just so we could\
  \ get circulation numbers high enough to begin the daunting task of trying to attract\
  \ advertisers that might want to pay us. We hadn't yet realized it, but before our\
  \ first issue even hit the stands, the world's oldest sci-fi magazine's days were\
  \ once again numbered.</p> \n   <p>So what about <i>Undefeated</i>, with its non-returnable\
  \ hobby sales revenue? We mentioned last month that if we could just get every game\
  \ store in the country to buy two copies, we'd be set. (And frankly, we probably\
  \ could have gotten by with just one copy per store.) But what we hadn't considered\
  \ was the low value proposition for hobby distributors. Hobby distributors make\
  \ a percentage of the retail price of everything they sell to their retailers. They\
  \ have a limited amount of time each month in direct contact with each retailer,\
  \ though, and if they have the choice between spending five minutes trying to get\
  \ them to buy an $80 trading card game display box or trying to get them to buy\
  \ an $8 magazine, well, the game makes them 10 times the money. After 10 issues,\
  \ we realized that we weren't going to get around that fact, and coupled with the\
  \ lack of ad revenue, we had to pull the plug on <i>Undefeated</i>.</p> \n   <div\

  \ with creative people in a high-stress environment such as magazine publishing\
  \ can lead to crazy and fun times. In 2004, a meme started with photos of employees\
  \ slapping Advertising Director Rob Stewart. Of course, it was all choreographed.\
  \ As time went on, the phony slaps became more and more animated. Here are a number\
  \ of pictures of folks doing \"The Slap\" on Rob.\n    <br> From Left to Right:\
  \ Amanda Titus, David Neri, Erik Mona, Keith Strohm, Sarah Robinson, and Sean Glenn.\n\

  \ \n   <p>2004 was a crazy year for me. I was working for an architectural firm\
  \ in Milwaukee while moonlighting with the RPGA as one of the Living Greyhawk campaign\
  \ directors. My duties included writing, editing, and approving adventures, so I\
  \ decided to try to get published in <i>Dungeon</i>, sending them an adventure that\
  \ was tied into Living Greyhawk. Erik and James liked the idea and published \"\
  Mad God's Key\" in <a href=\"/products/btpy7to0\"><i>Dungeon</i> #114</a>.</p> \n\
  \   <p>I had always wanted to work in the game industry, and with a publishing credit\
  \ under my belt and a few years’ experience working with Wizards, I decided to shoot\
  \ for the moon and applied for a job in Wizards of the Coast's R&amp;D department.\
  \ I was incredibly surprised when I made it all the way to the end of the process,\
  \ and in July, Wizards flew me out to Seattle for a face-to-face interview. I knew\
  \ the job at Wizards was a long shot, so it came as no real surprise when they eventually\
  \ offered the job to someone else.</p> \n   <p>But while I was in town for the Wizards\
  \ interview, I also paid a visit to Paizo, where Erik hastily put me to work combing\
  \ through the slush pile. As it turns out, while Wizards was interviewing me, they\
  \ were also interviewing <i>Dragon</i> editor Matt Sernett for a different position,\
  \ and when they hired Matt a few months later, that left Paizo with a job opening.\
  \ Erik dropped me an email to let me know that Paizo was hiring, and just two weeks\
  \ later, after a few quick calls and an interview, I was driving out to Seattle.\
  \ My first day of work was October 11.</p> \n   <p>The whole time was rather surreal.\
  \ I was incredibly excited to be working on <i>Dragon</i>, a magazine I had been\
  \ reading since I was a kid, but I didn't know much about how magazines were put\
  \ together. It was a steep learning curve, but I had plenty of time in my life for\
  \ work. I was living in a tiny place with rented furniture until my belongings back\
  \ in Milwaukee could be packed up and shipped out to join me. I didn't know anyone\
  \ other than my coworkers, so I didn't have too many distractions. That said, I\
  \ nearly quit and drove back to Milwaukee just a few weeks later.</p> \n   <p>Everything\
  \ had seemed to be going fine. I was finally getting a handle on how the job worked\
  \ when Erik came back into the editorial pit and closed the door—and nobody <i>ever</i>\
  \ closed that door. He explained to everyone that Paizo was laying off a number\
  \ of employees and putting <i>Undefeated</i> and <i>Amazing Stories</i> on permanent\
  \ hiatus. I was shocked. I was worried that I had joined a company that was in danger,\
  \ and I'd left behind a good stable job to do it. Later that afternoon, I pulled\
  \ Erik aside and asked him if I should plan to move back to Milwaukee. After all,\
  \ my old lease wasn't even up, and I was pretty sure I could get my old job back.\
  \ He reassured me that <i>Dragon</i> and <i>Dungeon</i> were doing great and that\
  \ I had nothing to worry about, but it took me a few more weeks to come to believe\
  \ that. Looking back, sticking with Paizo was the best decision I've ever made.</p>\
