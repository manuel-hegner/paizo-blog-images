  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><i>Tonya’s Note: While the first of the month blog\
  \ offers me an opportunity to talk about topics tangential to Organized Play, the\
  \ rest of the team hasn’t gotten many opportunities. Their communications usually\
  \ fall into categories – scenario previews, sanctioning updates, and program updates.\
  \ Today, we shake things up a bit, with a freeform blog by Organized Play Lead Developer\
  \ Linda Zayas-Palmer. We envision this style of blog as a regular feature, rotating\
  \ through the team. If you want to read more blogs like this, let us know in the\

  >Life as an Organized Play developer is filled with surprises. There’s almost never\
  \ a day when I sit down at my desk in the morning, put on my headphones, and just\
  \ work on a scenario until it’s time to go home. There are always other questions,\
  \ minor projects, and conversations that crop up. It’s challenging in a way that\
  \ keeps things engaging and exciting. Over the course of my four and a half years\
  \ here, I’ve gotten the chance to learn so many different skills. And it wasn’t\
  \ all the ones I expected. Sure, I’ve become better at writing, editing, mapping,\
  \ and pacing adventures. But I’ve also learned how to run auditions, how to speak\
  \ to crowds without being nervous, and, at the risk of sounding like a corny after-school\
  \ special, I learned to believe in myself. A big part of what makes the experience\
  \ on the Organized Play team so positive and has helped me grow as a person is the\
  \ people. My team is awesome. We joke around, give each other a light-hearted hard\
  \ time, and share our triumphs and struggles. And when misfortune strikes, we have\
  \ each other’s backs. I’m so fortunate to have the coworkers I do.</p> \n     <p>Certainly,\
  \ when I started, I didn’t expect that I’d be the Organized Play Lead Developer\
  \ someday. I saw John Compton with his seemingly endless lists of tasks to complete,\
  \ written in tiny handwriting on folded sheets of paper with checkboxes not much\
  \ bigger than the ones on a Chronicle sheet. I remember my first convention season\
  \ at Paizo, staring down the mountain of work that had to be done and internally\
  \ freaking out as I tried to figure out how it would be possible. And I remember\
  \ John reassuring me that we would make it work, because convention season is always\
  \ hard, but we always find a way. I remember working late nights at the office with\
  \ him, laughing, joking around, and making puns so bad he eventually just told me\
  \ in faux-horror that I should go home, and we should “never speak of this again”\
  . A few years later, when Michael Sayre had his first experience with the demands\
  \ of convention season, he asked me a similar question to the one I’d asked John.\
  \ And I found myself reassuring him, just as John had reassured me, that we would\
  \ make it work, because convention season is always hard, but we always find a way.\
  \ That feeling of being the experienced person, who trusted in our team to handle\
  \ the challenges set before it, has really stuck with me.</p> \n     <p>Our team\
  \ has a lot on our plates. You’ve probably noticed that we’re not as far along as\
  \ we’d hoped to be in terms of supporting Pathfinder Society in Second Edition and\
  \ filling in backlogs of First Edition support. There’s more that needs to be done\
  \ than there are working hours, and that’s not even to speak of what we would like\
  \ to do. But we have a bit advantage going into this year. I look back at the last\
  \ few years, in which we launched Starfinder Society, and the Playtest campaign,\
  \ and the revamped Adventure Card Society, and Pathfinder Society in Second Edition.\
  \ It’s rather liberating to not be actively building the bones of a new campaign,\
  \ but instead be able to focus on supporting what we already have and helping our\
  \ new Pathfinder Society take flight. As we look forward to the future, our team\
  \ is still short a person, but we’re actively working to fill that missing slot.\
  \ More on that soon. As for the rest of the team, I’ll leave it to them to share\
  \ their stories.</p> \n     <p>Take care, everyone, and enjoy your games :)</p>\
