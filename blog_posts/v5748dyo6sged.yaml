  \ \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">I'm a huge fan of the <a href=\"/kingmaker\"\
  >Kingmaker Adventure Path</a>. I have been ever since the first session of the Kingmaker\
  \ campaign I GMed, which ran for almost four years. My players made good use of\
  \ the sandbox nature of the AP to explore every nook and cranny of the adventure,\
  \ as well as many areas outside of its original scope. Writing additional content\
  \ for them was my first foray into designing my own adventures, and I learned so\
  \ much about being a good GM from that experience. So of course, when the opportunity\
  \ came up to write sanctioning documents for Kingmaker, I was excited to take on\
  \ the project. And then other tasks cropped up that had to be done right away. The\
  \ project got trapped in an endless cycle \"nice to have, but not nearly as urgent\
  \ as these ten other things.\" And in the end, the notes remained at the front of\
  \ my to-do folder for two whole years, waiting for something to shake loose so I\
  \ could work on them without neglecting my other responsibilities. Then the <a href=\"\
  /community/blog/v5748dyo6sga0?Pathfinder-Kingmaker-Out-Now-on-PC-and-Mac\">Pathfinder\
  \ Kingmaker computer RPG </a>launched, and everyone was excited about the Adventure\
  \ Path once again. I knew that it was time to pick up my old notes and finally finish\
  \ this project. If you're a fan of the adventure path who hasn't checked out the\
  \ computer game, or a fan of the computer game who hasn't tried the tabletop version\
  \ of the adventure path, I highly recommend them both.</p> \n    <p>As those of\
  \ you reading this blog may already know, there are two ways to run an Adventure\
  \ Path for Pathfinder Society credit: Campaign Mode and Event Mode. Campaign Mode\
  \ allows the GM freedom to run the entire Adventure Path with whatever rules she\
  \ chooses. It's worth pointing out that while you can't use the Pathfinder Kingmaker\
  \ computer RPG to earn credit for your Pathfinder Society character, you can earn\
  \ credit while playing your favorite class from one of Pathfinder's many talented\
  \ third-party publishers, or when playing in any other tabletop RPG system of your\
  \ choice (see the latest update to the <a href=\"/products/btpy84k4?Pathfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Guide\"\
  >Pathfinder Roleplaying Guild Guide</a> for more information). Meanwhile Event Mode,\
  \ originally designed for events like conventions and scheduled tables at gaming\
  \ stores, uses standard Pathfinder Society rules and characters. It's more approachable\
  \ for GMs who aren't looking to run a full campaign, who have limited time, or who\
  \ only want to run a portion of the Adventure Path. In Event Mode, GMs only run\
  \ some of the encounters in the Adventure Path, in a package that is more comparable\
  \ to the number of encounters that PCs would typically need to complete to gain\
  \ one level. Subsystems and other mechanics that cover an entire adventure volume\
  \ are generally represented only on Chronicle sheets.</p> \n    <p>Kingmaker presents\
  \ some unique challenges for Event Mode. It has quite a few load-bearing subsystems,\
  \ and it's a sandbox. To address the subsystems, I created two bonus Chronicle sheets.\
  \ The first bonus Chronicle sheet represents internal factors, like Economy, Loyalty,\
  \ and Stability, and Military strength. It lets you choose a kingdom role for your\
  \ character, shape your character's priorities, and benefit from your kingdom's\
  \ successes. Meanwhile, the second bonus Chronicle sheet features a territorial\
  \ expansion minigame. The sandbox feel is harder to capture that the subsystems.\
  \ Since the sense of wandering and discovery is so central to the first volume of\
  \ the Adventure Path, Stolen Lands, the sanctioned portions of that are more flexible.\
  \ GMs can choose several encounters from a long list to throw at PCs while they\
  \ explore.</p> \n    <p>But what if you've already started your Kingmaker campaign?\
  \ In keeping with our policy for the last several Adventure Paths, including <a\
  \ href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo5lj8v?By-Thunder-and-Fang\">Serpent's Skull, Curse\
  \ of the Crimson Throne</a>, <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo5lidu?You-Are-What-You-Choose-to-Be\"\
  >Giantslayer, and Iron Gods</a>, if you are still in the middle of playing one of\
  \ these Adventure Paths but have not yet concluded it, you can receive retroactive\
  \ credit for all of that Adventure Path's earlier volumes the next time you earn\
  \ a Chronicle sheet for that campaign. For example, let's say you were partway through\
  \ Kingmaker's Adventure Path's fifth volume, <i>War of the River Kings</i>. Once\
  \ you complete it, you'll receive retroactive Chronicle sheets for the first four\
  \ volumes of the Adventure Path.</p> \n    <p>I hope you all have as much fun with\
  \ Kingmaker as I have!</p> \n    <p><a href=\"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/paizo-images/image/download/PZO9000-6-Rules.zip\"\
