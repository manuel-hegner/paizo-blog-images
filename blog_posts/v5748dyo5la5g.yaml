  \ class=\"date\">Friday, August 17, 2007</p> \n   <p>The second day of any four-day\
  \ convention is typically referred to as the \"slow day.\" Retailers and manufacturers\
  \ complain that nearly every year their business is down, the crowds are down, and\
  \ Friday is generally a light day. Eager four-day attendees are typically seen swarming\
  \ the Dealer Hall on Thursday to get the awesome Gen Con exclusives (such as Paizo's\
  \ alternate Pathfinder #1 cover) and those folks are more inclined to game and rest\
  \ on Friday. Then the two-day crowd hits with the four-day crowd on Saturday and\
  \ the show floor turns into a zoo.</p> \n   <p>Today was slow for us, but we're\
  \ only able to say so because yesterday was such a huge hit. Pathfinder and GameMastery\
  \ Modules continue to do very well and I'm pleased to report that our first three\
  \ Planet Stories novels (<i>The Anubis Murders</i>, <i>City of the Beast</i>, and\
  \ <i>Black God's Kiss</i>) are selling very well and their positive reception has\
  \ been exciting to see.</p> \n   <p>Speaking of <i>The Anubis Murders</i>, Gary\
  \ Gygax was on hand this afternoon for 90 minutes signing copies of his book and\
  \ generally anything people asked him to sign. \"Keep on the Borderlands\" got several\
  \ Gygax-o-graphs as did the original hardcover Monster Manual, current editions\
  \ of the core system, badges, convention on-site books—you name it. Someone jokingly\
  \ asked Gary to sign their baby and he would've done so, graciously, had they not\
  \ told him it was a joke. He was a nice guy and it was a real honor to meet him.\
  \ One quick story about his session in the booth today: a guy walked up, looked\
  \ at his book and said, \"Hmm, Anubis Murders, I'm not familiar with your work.\
  \ I'll have to go look it up.\" Gary gave him a stern, reproachful look and said,\
  \ \"Try Dungeons &amp; Dragons.\" Needless to say, the guy looked very sheepish\
  \ as he fled the scene.</p> \n   <p>We also had the pleasure of Wayne Reynolds'\
  \ presence in our booth today, signing copies of the poster included with Dragon\
  \ #359. He modeled Pathfinder #1 for us, as you'll see below.</p> \n   <p>The number\
  \ one question on everyone's mind, of course, was \"What does Paizo think of 4th\
  \ Edition?\" We heard this often and our response was the same each time: we're\
  \ excited to see it, but we know just as much about it as you do. I can report that\
  \ WotC intends to have an OGL with 4th Edition and that Paizo's eager to learn more,\
  \ but that does not put us closer to a decision—it only puts us in need of more\
  \ research and discussion. Rest assured, the moment we make a decision we'll scream\
  \ it to the four corners of the multiverse.</p> \n   <p>And now, pictures!</p> \n\
