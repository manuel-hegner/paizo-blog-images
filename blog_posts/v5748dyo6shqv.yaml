  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">It all started\
  \ when Starfinder launched and John Compton (lead of Organized Play development\
  \ at the time) kept threatening me with a “Time Capsule Boon” where he’d let Pathfinder\
  \ Society Characters transition into Starfinder Society. It was something of the\
  \ atomic bomb equivalent of threats to be uttered in the office. The idea of crossing\
  \ the streams between the campaigns was ludicrous. LUDICROUS, I SAY!</p> \n    \
  \ <p>Cut to a few years later: John had moved on to join the Starfinder team (ha,\
  \ irony!), and the new Pathfinder Society developer, Michael Sayre, approached me\
  \ with the historic line of “Hey, wanna do a crossover interactive?” Thus the idea\
  \ of doing a crossover interactive between Pathfinder Society and Starfinder Society\
  \ was truly born!</p> \n     <p>A few months later, during one of my in-person visits\
  \ to the Seattle office, Michael and I got to deliver our pitch to both James Jacobs\
  \ and Rob McCreary (the Creative Directors for both Pathfinder and Starfinder, respectively).\
  \ Michael and I finished a whirlwind pitch that talked about time travel, navigating\
  \ the Gap, and using the Maze of the Open Road to travel to far-off lands.</p> \n\
  \     <p>In the ensuing seconds, you could have heard a pin drop. The only real\
  \ sound in the room was the formation of sweat on the respective brows of Michael\
  \ and I, as our ridiculous pitch was hurled at our company’s two creative visionaries.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Then, with wide smiles, the two of them both joined in on the scheming!\
  \ Dimension of Time, Hounds of Tindalos, Chronomancy and more were thrown at the\
  \ wall as possible reasons and storyline elements for this outlandish plan, and\
  \ the Organized Play Team had full buy-in from Paizo’s Creative Directors.</p> \n\
  \     <p>Of course, Michael Sayre would go on to great deeds in his current role\
  \ as a designer for Pathfinder. That meant that a new lead would need to step in\
  \ and help, which brings Jenny Jarzabski into the fold. Jenny heard the wild plan\
  \ of a crossover special and she immediately took the figurative football and ran\
  \ with it, deciding to tackle the story on her end!</p> \n     <p>So let’s listen\
  \ to her explain what happened next...</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a\

  \     <p>I’ve been tagged in! As Thursty said, this idea started before I joined\
  \ the team, but I took over the narrative planning, and of course the development\
  \ on the Starfinder side.</p> \n     <p>Obviously, this special is going to feel\
  \ different from the ones you’ve played in the past. First of all, this is an epic\
  \ crossover event that spans time, space, and two different rules systems and settings!\
  \ That’s pretty darn exciting by itself, right? But that’s not all! When our unholy\
  \ trinity—John Compton, Thursty, and myself—got together to talk shop and brainstorm\
  \ ideas for how to make this special, well, <em>special</em>, we came to a unified\
  \ decision. Almost all of our previous interactives have been world-shattering events\
  \ where the PCs play big damn heroes trying to save the whole world. It’s a pretty\
  \ cool way to frame an event, but after years of this, the devs were engaged in\
  \ a race against ourselves to make each year’s special bigger and the stakes higher\
  \ than the last. This is not a sustainable cycle. Quickly, we found ourselves (and\
  \ many of the players!) burning out and feeling fatigue from saving the world year\
  \ after year.</p> \n     <p>That’s why this year’s special won’t be about saving\
  \ the world. This time, it’s personal. Based on notes from our brainstorm sesh,\
  \ I crafted a heartwarming (or heartbreaking?) narrative in which the PCs can save\
  \ a group of lost explorers. In order to experience the full story, you should play\
  \ both the Pathfinder and Starfinder versions of the event. Now, if you’re not sold\
  \ on the smaller-scale event, don’t worry. This plotline is epic—it involves a crossover\
  \ between the Societies with both sides time traveling and battling extraplanar\
  \ horrors, after all!</p> \n     <p>Telling you any more would bring us firmly into\
  \ spoiler territory, but I look forward to the results of your efforts to delve\
  \ into mysterious ruins across two timelines and save maybe not the world, but someone’\
  s world. Well, maybe you’ll save the world, too. Multitasking.</p> \n     <p style=\"\
