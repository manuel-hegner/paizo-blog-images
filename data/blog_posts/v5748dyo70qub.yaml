  \     </div>\n     <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Joganer's head\
  \ pounded, all memories of last night's party washed away. He knew he should've\
  \ gotten the Sopeth liver scrubber to go with his ultimate cardio mod system. Maybe\
  \ after this paycheck, he could hit the clinic for another upgrade.</p>\n      <p>His\
  \ comm chirped.</p>\n      <p>\"Manticore One, I want her alive and talking.\" His\
  \ handler's garbled, grating voice didn't soothe his throbbing head. \"You copy?\"\
  </p>\n      <p>Joganer grunted. \"Solid. We're loaded up with stunners.\"</p>\n\
  \      <p>He scanned the darkened, twisting pipes around him, sensors rendering\
  \ their outlines clear as day cycle into his HUD. The refinery's heat exchange was\
  \ a labyrinth: low ceilings, exposed ducts, lots of places an intruder could hide.</p>\n\
  \      <p>\"Her signal is coming from the control box, next junction.\"</p>\n  \
  \    <p>Joganer's HUD highlighted a spill of dim light through the pipes beyond.\
  \ He checked the ammo readout on his weapon and switched off the safety. \"Manticore\
  \ Team, stack up on my position.\"</p>\n      <p>Shadows slipped from every corner\
  \ of the room, power armored, elite mercenaries slinking in his direction—all Sopeth\
  \ grafted for maximum lethality. They silently formed a line behind him, the nearest\
  \ member placing a hand on his back to signal readiness.</p>\n      <p>Joganer raised\
  \ his weapon. \"Move in on three... two... one...\"</p>\n      <p>The team burst\
  \ into the clearing to find a damaya lashunta crouched over an open panel, the luminous\
  \ blue tips of her antennae waving gently. She didn't look like much of a threat,\
  \ but she fit the description they'd been given: short, a fetish for green with\
  \ a fashion sense like a huffed-out raver. The target wore armor, though nothing\
  \ anyone might take seriously. The stuffed green plush makiri in her hand matched\
  \ the accents of the pistol at her hip.</p>\n      <p>\"Woooooow...\" She looked\
  \ them up and down. \"It's like <em>Operation Ultra Force</em> over here!\"</p>\n\
  \      <p>Joganer knew the infosphere show well. He hated it.</p>\n      <p>He engaged\
  \ his helmet intercom. \"Raia Danviri, interlace your fingers behind your head and—\
  \"</p>\n      <p>\"No.\" She fastened her makiri's hands behind her neck like a\
  \ kid about to take her favorite stuffie to school and whispered something to it.\
  \ Then she met Joganer's gaze. \"Why don't you tell me who sent you?\"</p>\n   \
  \   <p>\"You're not in a position to make demands.\"</p>\n      <p>She shrugged.\
  \ \"Just trying to do what's best for all of us.\"</p>\n      <p>With a flick of\
  \ her fingers, a spell gem appeared in her hand. A word from her lips, and thick\
  \ grease bubbled up beneath the fireteam's boots. Manticore Three and Four slipped\
  \ to the ground instantly. Joganer stumbled out of the puddle as Raia snapped the\
  \ spent crystal into her pistol, grinning wide.</p>\n      <p>\"Alaka-blam, boys!\"\
  </p>\n      <p>The shockwave of pure force sent Joganer's prone colleagues skidding\
  \ away on snail trails. Laughing, Raia threw a flare into the grease, turning the\
  \ path between them into a bonfire. The rest of Manticore Team scrambled backward,\
  \ terrified to be caught in the flames.</p>\n      <p>Joganer took a shot at Raia\
  \ as she fled into the shadows, but his stunner rounds only dented the nearby pipes.\
  \ Fire suppressors popped out of every surface, spraying everyone down with fluorescent\
  \ blue retardant. The powder clung to Raia's grease, leaving Manticore Team caked\
  \ up and pissed off.</p>\n      <p>\"Get up! She's getting away! Let's go, let's\
  \ go!\" Joganer pulled his struggling team to their feet and wiped his visor. \"\
  Two, Three, take left. Four and Five, take right. I'm headed up the center. Do not\
  \ shoot me.\"</p>\n      <p>\"If you let her get away,\" came the handler's voice\
  \ in Joganer's ear, \"the consequences will be swift.\"</p>\n      <p>He sneered\
  \ as he pressed into the darkness. \"She won't. We've got the whole place locked\
  \ down.\"</p>\n      <p>Manticore Team moved into the jungle of pipes, rifles at\
  \ the ready. Their friendly transponders pinged in the distance, flanking alongside\
  \ Joganer. They were ready this time; she didn't stand a chance.</p>\n      <p><em>You\
  \ could just tell me who sent you</em><em>.</em> Raia's voice spilled into his mind\
  \ like a whisper. <em>No need to get hurt</em>.</p>\n      <p>Joganer shook off\
  \ her distraction. It was nothing more than an old lashunta trick: get him to give\
  \ away his position without revealing her own.</p>\n      <p>Two pops rang out in\
  \ the darkness followed by screams from his left flank. Joganer barged through the\
  \ tangled walkways to find a pair of comrades writhing on the ground, powered joints\
  \ seizing and visors strobing. Their armor had stopped the shots, but it hadn't\
  \ mattered. Joganer knelt and tried to free them from their helmets, but the security\
  \ systems on their gear were totally fried—some kind of virus.</p>\n      <p>Two\
  \ more shots echoed from the stoneward side of the complex. Four and Five screamed\
  \ before their comms succumbed to static.</p>\n      <p>\"Manticore, sound off!\"\
  \ Joganer stayed frosty, moving away from his fallen friends. \"Who's still up?\"\
  </p>\n      <p><em>Just us now</em>, came Raia's cheery mental voice. <em>Why not\
  \ shout out the name of whoever sent you, and I can be their problem instead?</em></p>\n\
  \      <p>A signal pinged his acoustic scanner, and Joganer swept his muzzle toward\
  \ it. Then came another ping and another, resolving into the pattern of a cartoonish,\
  \ smiling face. She must've hacked his HUD somehow, turning it into a liability.</p>\n\
  \      <p>Snarling, Joganer shut down his suit. His limbs dragged like high-grav,\
  \ but his employer's grafts were more than strong enough to finish the mission.\
  \ That little pistol of hers couldn't do anything against his composite plating,\
  \ so the advantage was still his.</p>\n      <p>It'd been so long since he'd hunted\
  \ another person without the cheats of trackers and scanners, trusting only the\
  \ purity of his augmented senses. Without stealth compensators, his footfalls hit\
  \ harder, his gear rustled. Joganer's heart thundered, electrified to finally have\
  \ a chance to test his newest implants.</p>\n      <p>He laid eyes on Raia, crouched\
  \ near a junction and mostly obscured by a breaker assembly. She didn't spot him,\
  \ and he only needed to get closer for a clear shot at the dead center of her back.\
  \ Joganer advanced, restraining a smile.</p>\n      <p><em>Last chance</em>, she\
  \ spoke into his mind. <em>Disarm and hand over your boss.</em></p>\n      <p>Cocky\
  \ little thing. Finally in range, he imitated her spoiled tone with a sneer. \"\
  No.\"</p>\n      <p>Raia turned, bemused, and gave him a finger wave—</p>\n    \
  \  <p>—then disappeared <em>into</em> the console with a digital whoosh.</p>\n \
  \     <p>\"Damn it!\" He dashed to her position, frantic, and stopped dead when\
  \ he heard a second whoosh in his wake.</p>\n      <p>Raia's pistol hammer clicked\
  \ into place behind him as a barrel thunked against the back of his head.</p>\n\
  \      <p>\"Want the inside of your helmet cleaned out?\" He could hear the smile\
  \ in her voice against the rising whine of her gun.</p>\n      <p>Fine. Let her\
  \ shoot. It wouldn't penetrate. She couldn't hack his gear without power, and Joganer\
  \ could probably take her in hand-to-hand.</p>\n      <p>He was about to spin and\
  \ put her down, but the charging whine grew ever louder. Orange sunlight washed\
  \ the immediate area, and the back of his neck seared beneath the shielded plates\
  \ of his armor. Something inside his helmet stank of baking composite.</p>\n   \
  \   <p>What in the name of the gods was she pointing at him?</p>\n      <p>\"Overclocked.\
  \ Enough to turn your face into nothing more than a bad memory and a worse smell,\"\
  \ she said. \"Now tell me who sent you before I have to ask your next of kin.\"\
  </p>\n      <p>\"Sorry, Manticore Team,\" came the voice of the handler. \"Can't\
  \ have that.\"</p>\n      <p>\"What?\" Joganer grit his teeth.</p>\n      <p>\"\
  You're terminated, immediately. No payout. Thank you for your service.\"</p>\n \
  \     <p>If they weren't going to pay, then he might as well give them up.</p>\n\
  \      <p>\"Well?\" Raia asked.</p>\n      <p>Joganer tried to answer, but his breath\
  \ wouldn't come. It was like his diaphragm had simply stopped, and the air was stuck\
  \ inside his lungs. He could only form the S sound, opening and closing his mouth.\
  \ Terror seized his chest as all of his grafts slackened simultaneously—arms, eyes,\
  \ lungs.</p>\n      <p>Raia bonked the back of Joganer's helmet with the pistol\
  \ as he swooned from the lack of air. \"Hey. Say something.\"</p>\n      <p>He slowly\
  \ turned to her, blurry red shapes forming at the edge of his vision. Judging from\
  \ the way she recoiled, he didn't look good.</p>\n      <p>\"Ss... ss...\" He dropped\
  \ his rifle and groped at his throat before reaching for her.</p>\n      <p>Raia\
  \ grabbed him and shook him. \"Hey! What? No dying!\"</p>\n      <p>Joganer's armor\
  \ grew heavier. Dizziness overtook him. Parched lips and failing tongue curled into\
  \ formation as he concentrated with all his might. He sank to his knees, desperate\
  \ to utter one sound before the jaws of death closed about his mind.</p>\n     \
  \ <p>Raia eased him to the ground, rolling him onto his back. \"Look, if you want\
  \ revenge, you're gonna have to spit it out!\"</p>\n      <p>His eyes failed him,\
  \ and a rattle pushed one final word from his mouth:</p>\n      <p>\"Sssopethh...\"\
  </p>\n      <p>He listened intently for her response. It was the last thing he could\
  \ do. In the intimate moment of his passing, Joganer found himself wishing Raia\
  \ would say something, offer any kindness or justice to rest his soul.</p>\n   \
  \   <p>Her response was short. \"Sorry, I… I didn’t understand that.\"</p>\n   \
  \   <p>Joganer gave up.</p>\n      <br>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n   \
