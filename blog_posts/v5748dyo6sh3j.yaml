  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Greetings, Society Members!<br>\
  \ Earlier today, we revealed the next round of sanctioning for Starfinder Society—\
  including the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventurePath/attackOfTheSwarm\"\
  >Attack of the Swarm!</a> and <a href=\"https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventurePath/threefoldconspiracy\"\
  >Threefold Conspiracy</a> Adventure Paths Chronicle Sheets. If you missed that blog,\
  \ you can catch up <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh3i\">here</a>!</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Now it’s Pathfinder’s turn. The team finished their review of the products\
  \ and consulted with our community’s Additional Resource team about what best fit\
  \ the Organized Play environment. Instead of waiting for an updated web page with\
  \ formatting, we decided to get everything into our players’ hands. That doesn’\
  t mean a new site with better layout isn’t coming, we just didn’t want to hold things\
  \ up any longer waiting our turn in the web queue. All the rulebooks and Lost Omens\
  \ products, up to and including <a ahref=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq021wf?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Gods-Magic\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Lost Omens Gods &amp; Magic</i></a>, appear in this update, so there\
  \ is plenty to choose from. Apologies for the length—If you want to find a particular\
  \ section, we suggest using control + F and the name of the book you’re looking\
  \ for.</p> \n     <p>We made a few changes to the layout and structure of the character\
  \ options, as well as how we look at what we include in the campaign. To help players\
  \ understand what goes into character options, as well as the parameters and criteria\
  \ in how we address concepts, we included a new section at the top of this document.\
  \ Some of the items in this section include core assumptions, table policy, and\
  \ access. This information is being migrated to the guide and will appear there\
  \ with the next update.</p> \n     <p>You’ve waited long enough, so without further\
  \ ado, here is the first batch of Pathfinder Society (Second Edition) character\
  \ options!</p> \n     <p>I’ll see you next week for our beginning of the month update\
  \ on Society!</p> \n     <p>Until then – Explore, Report, Cooperate!</p> \n    \

  \ \n      </ul> \n     </ul> \n     <p>To use an option from any source other than\
  \ the <i>Pathfinder Core Rulebook</i>, the <i>Pathfinder Bestiary</i>, or the <i>Lost\
  \ Omens World Guide</i> in Pathfinder Society play, you must bring any one of the\
  \ following to your game table:</p> \n     <ul> \n      <li>A physical copy of the\
  \ book you wish to use</li> \n      <li>A name-watermarked PDF copy of the book</li>\
  \ \n      <li>Name-watermarked printouts of all relevant pages you wish to use from\
  \ the PDF</li> \n      <li>Access to the rules you wish to use in the form of either\
  \ electronic access to the Pathfinder Reference Document (paizo.com/prd) or a photocopy\
  \ of the relevant pages, along with proof of purchase, such as a receipt from a\
  \ game store or a screenshot of your My Downloads page on paizo.com.</li> \n   \
  \  </ul> \n     <p>The following do not satisfy this requirement:</p> \n     <ul>\
  \ \n      <li>A photocopy of a physical book with no proof of purchase</li> \n \
  \     <li>Printouts from electronic character builders such as Hero Lab</li> \n\
  \      <li>Content reproduced in other sources under the Open Gaming License (such\
  \ as an online reference document or a homemade omnibus)</li> \n     </ul> \n  \
  \   <p>Family members, significant others, or other members of the same household\
  \ (such as roommates) can share resources if they are playing at the same table,\
  \ rather than requiring a separate copy of the same book for each person. A group\
  \ of friends that always plays together at the same table fulfills this requirement,\
  \ as long as all the necessary materials for each character's options are present.\
  \ Members playing at separate tables must each supply their own materials as normal.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>In addition to the copy of the rules themselves, you must be able to\
  \ provide an electronic or physical copy of the below Additional Resources page\
  \ for that source to show that the options you have selected for your character\
  \ are legal for play.</p> \n     <h3><font color=\"maroon\">Rarity, Access, and\
  \ Availability</font></h3> \n     <p>Character options for Pathfinder Society play\
  \ have one of three levels of availability: standard, limited, or restricted. </p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>Standard:</b> These options follow the standard rules as printed\
  \ in their respective sourcebooks. If a character wants to take this option, they\
  \ must meet all its <b>prerequisites</b> as usual. If the option is uncommon or\
  \ rarer, they must also have access to the option. Characters can gain <b>access</b>\
  \ in a variety of ways. They can gain access by virtue of their origin, religion,\
  \ or their membership in certain organizations (see below sections). Selecting certain\
  \ common character options can give you access to other, rarer ones; for instance,\
  \ a gnome who takes the Gnome Weapon Familiarity ancestry feat gains access to uncommon\
  \ gnome weapons. Specific boons—such as from the Achievement Points system or Chronicle\
  \ Sheets—can also grant access to these options.</p> \n     <p><b>Limited:</b> A\
  \ limited option is rarer in Society play, but not unheard of. A limited option\
  \ can be selected only if specifically allowed by a boon—whether from the Achievement\
  \ Points system, a Chronicle Sheet, or another other option from a Pathfinder Society\
  \ source—even if the option is common or if the character meets the normal prerequisites\
  \ or access requirements printed in the option’s source.</p> \n     <p><b>Restricted:</b>\
  \ A restricted option is one that is not generally appropriate for all tables or\
  \ conducive to the Pathfinder Society's shared campaign setting, such as a one-of-a-kind\
  \ weapon, a horrific spell used by only the most evil magic-users, or player options\
  \ that require high degrees of GM adjudication. Such options will generally be made\
  \ available for Society Play in only a very few special cases, such as via boons\
  \ given out as part of charity events, if at all.</p> \n     <h3><font color=\"\
  maroon\">Character Origin</font></h3> \n     <p>When you create a character, you\
  \ can choose their origin, including their ethnicity and nationality/region of origin.\
  \ These choices might allow your character to take certain character options. For\
  \ instance, humans of Jadwiga ethnicity descend from the witch-queens of Irrisen,\
  \ and they can take the Irriseni Ice-Witch feat to represent this connection. Similarly,\
  \ characters from the Broken Lands have access to the Aldori dueling swords that\
  \ are iconic to that region.</p> \n     <p>If your character is of mixed ethnicity\
  \ or comes from multiple regions of origin, then for the purposes of game balance,\
  \ you choose one ethnicity and one region of origin that your character can use\
  \ to satisfy prerequisite and access conditions for character options. This affects\
  \ only the character options you can select, and in no way limits your character’\
  s identity or story.</p> \n     <p>Certain boons, such as Home Region or Multicultural\
  \ Training, can allow you to change or expand your character’s origin for the purpose\
  \ of qualifying for character options, to reflect their life experiences.</p> \n\
  \     <h3><font color=\"maroon\">Religion</font></h3> \n     <p>When you create\
  \ a character, you can choose their religion or philosophy. If your character is\
  \ of a class that directly interacts with the divine, such as a cleric or a champion,\
  \ you must make this choice at first level as part of gaining your class abilities.\
  \ However, characters of any class might be allowed to certain character options\
  \ based on the deity they follow. For instance, all followers of Abadar gain access\
  \ to Abadar’s <i>flawless scale</i>, a magic item considered holy by the faith.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Characters can worship and gain mechanical benefits from any deity listed\
  \ in the table of gods on page 437 of the <i>Core Rulebook</i> or detailed in <i>Lost\
  \ Omens Gods &amp; Magic</i>, so long as their alignment matches one of the deity’\
  s listed follower alignments. Note that some deities, such as Rovagug or Urgathoa,\
  \ allow only evil followers; as Society characters cannot be lawful evil, neutral\
  \ evil, or chaotic evil, these deities cannot be worshiped to gain benefits in Society\
  \ play. Characters can also be agnostic, atheist, or can follow the tenets of philosophies\
  \ (<i>Lost Omens Gods &amp; Magic</i> 94–101) rather than deities.</p> \n     <p>Your\
  \ character can participate in the rituals and cultural aspects of a deity’s faith\
  \ without being a worshipper of that deity; for instance, citizens of the diabolic\
  \ nation of Cheliax might participate in state holidays revering Asmodeus, the Prince\
  \ of Darkness, but only lawful evil followers are true worshippers of his faith.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>If your character worships multiple deities, then for the purposes of\
  \ game balance, you choose one deity that your character can use to satisfy prerequisite\
  \ and access conditions for character options. This affects only the character options\
  \ you can select, and in no way limits your character’s identity or story.</p> \n\
  \     <h4><font color=\"#daa520\">Pantheons</font></h4> \n     <p>Characters can\
  \ also follow pantheons (<i>Lost Omens Gods &amp; Magic</i> 92) instead of specific\
  \ deities, in which case they gain the benefits of the pantheon as a whole. Characters\
  \ in Society play must choose a patron deity when following a pantheon. They can\
  \ use both their patron deity and the pantheon as a whole to satisfy access and\
  \ prerequisites, but not any other deities in the pantheon individually. For instance,\
  \ a lawful neutral cleric could worship the Godclaw, with Iomedae as her patron\
  \ deity, in which case she could take options related to both Iomedae and the Godclaw,\
  \ but this wouldn’t automatically allow her to take options related to Torag, Irori,\
  \ Abadar, or Asmodeus.</p> \n     <h4><font color=\"#daa520\">Edicts and Anathema\
  \ in Society Play</font></h4> \n     <p>Several characters, such as clerics or champions,\
  \ must abide by the edicts and anathema of their deity to receive divine powers\
  \ from that deity. To allow a wide variety of characters in Society play, the rules\
  \ around edicts and anathema are slightly relaxed. It is generally assumed that\
  \ all characters can participate in Pathfinder Society adventures without running\
  \ afoul of their deity’s edicts and anathema—attempting to perform the primary objective\
  \ of an official Pathfinder Society mission by itself will not cause a character\
  \ to fall out of favor with their deity. For example, Pharasma prohibits robbing\
  \ tombs, but a cleric of Pharasma can accept a Society mission to retrieve an artifact\
  \ from a pyramid, confident that the Society has gone through the proper channels\
  \ to secure the right to retrieve the artifact. </p> \n     <p>While edicts are\
  \ valorous actions praised by a deity, a character does not need to perform their\
  \ deity’s edicts to the exclusion of other activities, or if doing so would prevent\
  \ the smooth progression of play at the table. When considering anathema, note that\
  \ a character must actively and personally commit an anathemic act in Society play\
  \ to incur consequences with their deity, and is not liable for the actions of their\
  \ party members. For instance, a champion of Sarenrae could not personally lie to\
  \ a guard when infiltrating a city, but they do not need to force the party’s rogue\
  \ to tell the truth (though they might look on disapprovingly)</p> \n     <p>Remember\
  \ that edicts and anathema exist to create roleplaying opportunities at the table\
  \ for your character, and should not be used by the GM to pressure PCs, or by PCs\
  \ to pressure other members of the table toward specific styles of play.</p> \n\
  \     <h3><font color=\"maroon\">Uncommon Ancestries</font></h3> \n     <p>Because\
  \ your ancestry is the first thing you pick about your character and it is not possible\
  \ to retrain your ancestry as you might retrain other options, the only way to select\
  \ uncommon or rarer ancestries is with a boon that allows you to create a new character\
  \ of this ancestry.</p> \n     <h3><font color=\"maroon\">Organization Membership</font></h3>\
  \ \n     <p>Through the course of your character’s adventures, you might meet influential\
  \ members of other organizations and have the opportunity to learn from them. The\
  \ Secondary Initiation boon can be used to gain membership in an organization and\
  \ access to its character options.</p> \n     <h3><font color=\"maroon\">Books</font></h3>\

  \ temporary Hit Points granted by the Spell Devourer orc ancestry feat (page 19)\
  \ are applied as soon as the character succeeds at their saving throw; for an effect\

  \ \n       <li>Unless specifically noted otherwise, most wands and scrolls are less\

  \ feat (page 60) a hint whenever the character enters a room with hidden aspects,\
  \ specifically with regard to hidden passageways (such as scuff marks near a bookcase\
  \ that’s actually a swinging door), creatures or hazards (such as drippage on the\
  \ floor from an unseen fungus growing on the rafters), or valuables (such as bunched\
  \ carpet over a secret compartment in the floor that contains a bag of coins). The\
  \ GM does not need to provide clues for rooms that have no significant secret or\

  \ (page 108) can benefit from spells and magic items if they are an unavoidable\
  \ part of a Society adventure, such as if a scenario assumes the PCs are transported\
  \ to their mission location via a <em>teleport</em> spell, or if an adventure requires\
  \ that all PCs participate in a magical ritual.</li> \n       <li>Per design team\
  \ clarification, when a barbarian uses the Sunder Spell feat (page 111) against\
  \ a spell like <em>wall of fire</em> that does not have a listed AC, the Strike\
  \ hits automatically—the barbarian simply rolls the counteract check. </li> \n \
  \      <li>A cavalier (page 184) can pledge to a legal deity, religion, or pantheon,\
  \ an organization they have access to, or the Pathfinder Society. The edicts and\
  \ anathema of the Pathfinder Society are as follows:<br> <b>Edicts</b>: Explore\
  \ important sites, report and record your discoveries, and cooperate with fellow\
  \ Pathfinders<br> <b>Anathema</b>: Fail to explore, report and cooperate; defy the\
  \ will of a venture-captain or the Decemvirate</li> \n       <li>A vigilante’s Safe\
  \ House (page 196), can be located in any city or near any lodge they have received\
  \ a Pathfinder briefing. A vigilante can use their downtime to relocate their safe\
  \ house. A vigilante can use their safe house only if it is in the town or location\
  \ where their current adventure is taking place.</li> \n       <li>The DCs for the\
  \ Armor Assist feat (page 203) are not subject to GM adjudication. Rather, simply\
  \ use the default DCs listed in the feat: 15 for common armor, 20 for uncommon armor,\
  \ and 25 for rare armor.</li> \n       <li>For the purposes of Society play, the\
  \ <b>Targets</b> entry for the <em>claim undead</em> (page 230) oracle revelation\
  \ spell is “1 mindless undead creature”, not “1 undead creature.” The intent of\
  \ this change is to reduce the prevalence of domination magic on sapient creatures\
  \ in Society play.</li> \n       <li>Strikes made by a <em>malicious shadow</em>\
