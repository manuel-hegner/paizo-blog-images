  \   <h1>Grand Convocation Preview Highlights</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Monday,\
  \ June 25, 2012</p> \n    <p>This week’s blog is not only going to be my last sneak\
  \ peak blog for the Grand Convocation, but is also going to be a change of pace\
  \ from our last few, in-character updates on the upcoming Grand Convocation. Today\
  \ we’re going to talk about it from an event standpoint.</p> \n    <p>For those\
  \ who don’t know, the 2012 Grand Convocation will be running at PaizoCon, and will\
  \ be the premiere Pathfinder Society event. What we haven’t discussed in detail\
  \ is exactly what the event will comprise, so today I’m going to talk about that!</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurb180\">\n     <a href=\"/paizocon\"><img src=\"/image/content/Logos/PaizoCon2012Logo_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>The Grand Convocation takes place Friday\
  \ evening. Check-in for the event will begin at 6:30 P.M., giving players time to\
  \ get in while GMs and volunteers finish up their prep. Each player will get a nametag,\
  \ along with a special faction mission for the event.</p> \n    <p>At 7 P.M. the\
  \ Grand Convocation officially opens. From here players will be able to participate\
  \ in a series of ongoing events:</p> \n    <p><b>Side Tables:</b> Each side table\
  \ will give players a relatively quick event to experience, and each table may award\
  \ a special Chronicle sheet depending on how well the players did during the event.\
  \ These events may also be staffed by important NPCs, so in order to complete some\
  \ faction missions, the players will need to attend these events and meet with the\
  \ NPC.</p> \n    <p><b>Quests:</b> Throughout the Convocation, venture-captains\
  \ will be recruiting parties for dangerous missions. Players can expect to join\
  \ a quest while they are waiting for the side tables, or resting and relaxing at\
  \ the Pathfinder Social. Each player can expect a 45-minute to 1.5-hour event that\
  \ awards a Chronicle sheet for completing the quest.</p> \n    <p><b>Pathfinder\
  \ Social:</b> As a rest-and-relaxation area, the Pathfinder Social will also have\
  \ timed events occur. Players can interact in a live-action environment, without\
  \ any enforced rules system governing their actions. This is a non-combat zone.\
  \ Several faction-mission-related objectives will be found here.</p> \n    <p><b>Faction\
  \ Missions:</b> Each faction present at the Convocation will have a specific agenda,\
  \ and players will be asked to aid their faction in promoting this agenda. We’re\
  \ going to keep the specifics on the faction missions a mystery for now, but the\
  \ results of these missions will directly impact a small part of Season 4 of Pathfinder\
  \ Society!</p> \n    <p><b>Surprises:</b> There are also a few other things planned\
  \ but I don’t want to spoil all the surprises. Suffice it to say, there should be\
  \ some very happy players by the time the Convocation ends. </p> \n    <p>The above\
  \ events will wrap up by 10:30 P.M., at which point players will partake in a final\
  \ event to close out the Convocation. As for what this finale entails... well, you’\
  ll just have to show up and find out for yourself!</p> \n    <p>Mike Brock<br> <i>Pathfinder\
  \ Society Campaign Coordinator</i></p> \n   </blockquote> <!-- tags: Pathfinder\
