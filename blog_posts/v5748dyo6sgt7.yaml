  \    </div> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Over the past\
  \ few months we’ve spent a great deal of time talking about Pathfinder Second Edition,\
  \ focusing primarily on the <i>Core Rulebook</i> and <i>Bestiary</i>. While these\
  \ two hefty tomes are absolutely essential for your table, there is one critical\
  \ thing that they lack: adventure! After all, what is a roleplaying game without\
  \ a fun, exciting story to experience?</p> \n     <p>Fortunately, we have a number\
  \ of amazing adventures releasing the same day as the <i>Core Rulebook</i>! So,\
  \ if you want to jump right into the game, there are a variety of tales waiting\
  \ to be told. (No need to worry about spoilers in this blog, we are only giving\
  \ you the basics)</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbLeft\" style=\"float:left; margin-right:\

  \ \n     <h2>The Fall of Plaguestone</h2> \n     <p>Designed for 1st-level characters,\
  \ <i>The Fall of Plaguestone</i> is a standalone 64-page adventure that is designed\
  \ to tell the story of how a group of strangers became companions. Think of it like\
  \ the origin story for your group.</p> \n     <p>The story opens in the back of\
  \ a merchant’s wagon caravan heading from Elidir—the capital of Isger—toward Andoran,\
  \ through the valley between the Aspodell and Five Kings mountain ranges. Stopping\
  \ at small villages and towns along the way, caravan master Bort Bargith is happy\
  \ to take on travelers, so long as they don’t mind stopping for him to do his business\
  \ along the way. His next stop is the town of Etran’s Folly, known to some as the\
  \ town of Plaguestone.</p> \n     <p><i>The Fall of Plaguestone</i> should take\
  \ around 40 hours of gameplay to complete (depending on the group) and by the end,\
  \ your characters should be around 4th level, ready to take on even greater adventures!</p>\
  \ \n     <h2 style=\"clear:both\">Age of Ashes Adventure Path</h2> \n     <p>Age\
  \ of Ashes is our first Adventure Path for Pathfinder Second Edition, and I wanted\
  \ to ensure that the storyline was suitably epic, gave players a good look at numerous\
  \ locations in the Age of Lost Omens, and played to the strengths of the new rules—\
  all while giving players a host of memorable villains and allies to meet, fight,\
  \ and befriend.</p> \n     <p><i>Hellknight Hill</i> starts in the nation of Isger,\
  \ a region we’ve not had the opportunity to do much with in previous Adventure Paths.\
  \ In doing so, we’ve got a mix of old lore (focusing on the abandoned Hellknight\
  \ Order of the Nail fortress, Citadel Altaerein, as the adventure’s primary site),\
  \ and brand-new lore (with the introduction of this campaign’s “home town” of Breachill).\
  \ During the course of Age of Ashes, the PCs will travel to several other sites\
  \ across the continents of Avistan and Garund, but Breachill and Citadel Altaerein\
  \ are very much intended to feel like home. If you’re planning on running Age of\
  \ Ashes for your group, you’ll want to become familiar with the town of Breachill,\
  \ detailed in this volume, and be ready to present the town’s inhabitants as needed.\
  \ Each volume of Age of Ashes will give additional information about key citizens\
  \ from the town on the inside back covers, but you should feel free to expand the\
  \ stories of those locals whom your players take a shine to as you see fit!</p>\

  \ </div> \n     <p>Citadel Altaerein itself is, in a way, one such character—for\
  \ once the PCs manage to deal with the monsters and dangers that occupy its halls,\
  \ they might just earn the right to claim the castle as their home! There’s far\
  \ more going on in Age of Ashes than castle management and hobnobbing with the locals,\
  \ but as the campaign grows more and more epic in scope, it’s important that your\
  \ players retain the feeling that Breachill is a safe haven—a place they can go\
  \ to relax, rest, and recover after their adventures. A place they can truly call\
  \ home!</p> \n     <p>Age of Ashes is a six-part campaign designed to take a party\
  \ of player characters from 1st to 20th level, and can provide months or even years\
  \ of gameplay depending on the pace and frequency of your particular group. Each\
  \ month we’ll release a new volume of the Adventure Path, which you can get through\
  \ our ongoing Pathfinder Adventure Path subscription. You can also use <i>Hellknight\
  \ Hill</i> as a standalone adventure with the potential to grow into a larger campaign,\
  \ so don’t hesitate to pick it up on Thursday to start your Pathfinder Second Edition\
  \ adventures with a bang!</p> \n     <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight:\
