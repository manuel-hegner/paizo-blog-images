  \ itemprop=\"description\">From the first, the organized play team envisioned Starfinder\
  \ Society as a stand-alone campaign. So when discussing season rotation, we looked\
  \ for a way to give the event spotlight focus. Putting the launch at Gen Con would\
  \ overload the team and possibly diminish the impact of the Pathfinder Society season\
  \ rotation. So we looked to another large event that would have the scope to handle\
  \ a season premier. Origins Game Faire, June 13-17 in Columbus, Ohio, met our desires.\
  \ Thus we brought Origins under the umbrella of Paizo-organized conventions. But\
  \ not only Starfinder Society benefits from the expanded Paizo focus. It also brings\
  \ an opportunity to play Version C of the <a href=\"/products/btpy9s15?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-899A-The-Solstice-Scar-Version-A\"\
  ><em>Solstice Scar</em></a> ongoing interactive event and the chance to participate\
  \ in some Pathfinder Playtest demos. Another benefit is added rewards for GMs, namely\
  \ store credit for the paizo.com webstore, volunteer t-shirts, and a copy of a Pathfinder\
  \ or Starfinder hardcover book, in addition to rewards offered in previous years\
  \ such as hotel rooms and boons.</p> \n    <p>With 35+ tables of scenarios and 5\
  \ tables of Pathfinder Playtest demonstrations running each 5-hour block, and 8\
  \ blocks scheduled between Wednesday and Sunday of the event, we need a goodly amount\
  \ of GMs to run games and demos at the event. Anyone interested in volunteering\
  \ should check out the <a href=\"https://form.jotform.com/80327742384156\" target=\"\
  _blank\">Origins 2018 GM Application</a> for a list of benefits and a questionnaire\
  \ to register interest in volunteering. For GMs interested in running Pathfinder\
  \ Playtest, please mark PFS Demo on the questionnaire.</p> \n    <p>For those community\
  \ members not interested in GMing, I invite you to join John Compton, Thurston,\
  \ myself, and a couple other Paizo staffers at Origins to experience the adventure\
  \ first hand.</p> \n    <p>Now onto a less logistical note, I'll turn the blog over\
  \ to Starfinder Society Developer Thurston Hillman to discuss specifics for the\
  \ Starfinder Society launch and what to expect from our ongoing storylines...</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Quoting Thurston Hillman, Starfinder Society Developer:</p> \n    <blockquote>\
  \ \n     <p>In the wake of all the excitement surrounding the <a href=\"/pathfinderplaytest\"\
  >announcement of the Pathfinder Playtest</a>, there have been some questions about\
  \ the future of Starfinder Society. Specifically, the team's been hearing a lot\
  \ of questions about our plans for our upcoming interactive special and the transition\
  \ into our next season. How about we dive into some answers?</p> \n     <p>We're\
  \ proud to announce our first Starfinder Society interactive special: <em>Starfinder\
  \ Society #1-99: The Scoured Stars Invasion</em>. This event is Starfinder Society's\
  \ first exclusive scenario, running at select events starting at Origins 2018 up\
  \ until the end of Gen Con 2018. Shortly after Gen Con, we'll be making this special\
  \ available to organizers and events across the world. To help with making sure\
  \ our first Starfinder interactive is one to remember, we've brought onboard veteran\
  \ freelancer, Mikko Kallio, to tackle this project. Mikko's had experience with\
  \ writing interactive specials (with the well-received <a href=\"/products/btpy9tld\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society #9–00: Assault on Absalom</em></a>), and the team wanted\
  \ to get him on this project to help ensure we get a good start with our first Starfinder\
  \ interactive special. I've been personally working with Mikko on this project and\
  \ I can already tell that it's going to be a very memorable event!</p> \n     <p>So\
  \ with that announcement, you can probably tell that our interactive special is\
  \ touching on some major elements for our ongoing storyline for Year of Scoured\
  \ Stars. One important caveat, is that \"The Scoured Stars Invasion\" is not the\
  \ end of the Year of Scoured Stars. Instead, we'll be going back to some of the\
  \ earlier days of Pathfinder's organized play campaigns and extending our inaugural\
  \ season into 2019. That's right, the Year of Scoured Stars will be getting a full\
  \ additional year of content behind it. When the team sat down to discuss how we'd\
  \ end the Scoured Stars storyline, we recognized that the abbreviated season made\
  \ it difficult to give the full story that we thought the players deserved—something\
  \ that changed when our schedule adjusted to 2 scenarios per month! We all agreed\
  \ that extending the season by another year gave us the ability to really tell this\
  \ defining introduction story for many Starfinder Society players.</p> \n     <p>Looking\
  \ ahead, players, GMs and organizers can view \"The Scoured Stars Invasion\" special\
  \ akin to the mid-season finales that have become popular in modern media. This\
  \ event will have some major repercussions that the campaign will explore into the\
  \ second half of its now-extended season. To maintain a cohesive narrative and not\
  \ punish players who don't have the chance to attend the events debuting the special,\
  \ we won't be directly following-up on these events until at least a month after\
  \ the exclusive window ends. This gives local lodges a chance to run the interactive\
  \ prior to delving into any scenarios that touch on the ramifications. To give us\
  \ that buffer, many of the scenarios following Origins will go back to some growing\
  \ fan favorites. While the details on these scenarios aren't entirely finalized,\
  \ our current \"schemes\" involve some of the following:</p> \n     <ul>\n     \
  \ <li>Finishing the \"Tour of the Pact Worlds\" by exploring some of the remaining\
  \ planets (sorry Aucturn, you'll have to wait a bit longer.)</li> \n      <li>Providing\
  \ a second Tier 5–8 scenario (this time with starship combat!)</li> \n      <li>Returning\
  \ to the false moon of <em>Salvation's End</em> (with a very special guest author\
  \ appearance.)</li> \n      <li>Yesteryear's Sorrow. (... nope, I got nothing else\
  \ to say about that one.)</li>\n     </ul> \n     <p>I wish I could say more, but\
  \ I'm going to remain silent as there's a lot of major changes coming with \"The\
  \ Scoured Stars Invasion.\" Sufficed to say, the second half of Year of the Scoured\
  \ Stars is going to be just as big, if not bigger, than the stories we've told over\
  \ the past months. Now more than ever, the Starfinder Society <a href=\"/starfindersociety\"\
  >needs new field agents</a>; if you haven't had the chance to try out some Starfinder\
  \ Society Roleplaying Guild games, I highly suggest taking a look. Between local\
  \ games and our thriving online community of play-by-post and virtual tabletop games,\
  \ there's probably never been a better time to get involved and experience the living\
  \ campaign that is Starfinder Society!</p> \n     <p>Time for me to get back to\
  \ scheming. There's a lot more stories to tell and the Year of Scoured Stars is\
  \ only just getting started!</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Convention season\
  \ is ramping up and I'm working diligently to get everything scheduled and delivered\
  \ as needed. If your expecting something for any convention, keep an eye on your\
  \ inbox.</p> \n    <p>Tune in next week for an update on GM stars, upcoming conventions,\
  \ and other topics of an organized play nature.</p> \n    <p>Until next time—explore,\
  \ report, cooperate!</p> \n    <p>Tonya Woldridge<br> <i>Organized Play Manager</i></p>\
