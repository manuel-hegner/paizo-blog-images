  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Monday, April 20, 2009</p> \n   <p>When you think of characters\
  \ in game-world fiction, what first comes to mind are the fighters, wizards, and\
  \ rogues. Priests are fine if they're sufficiently powerful and conflicted, otherwise,\
  \ not so much. Bards generally play second fiddle, you should pardon the expression,\
  \ and paladins are seldom cast in starring roles. The druids, apparently, are too\
  \ busy communing with nature to bother with fiction.</p> \n   <p>Since the publication\
  \ of my first shared-world book, <i>Elfshadow</i>, in 1991, I've hit most of the\
  \ character classes with the exception of the druid. Channa Ti, the protagonist\
  \ of the Pathfinder's Journal fiction in the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/legacyOfFire\"\
  >Legacy of Fire Adventure Path</a>, is my first.</p> \n   <p>I started with a typical\
  \ D&amp;D druid—a serene mystic who dwells in emerald groves, nurturing the woodland\
  \ creatures and healing hapless passersby with potions brewed from rare herbs and\
  \ crafted from recipes learned at the feet of wise, benevolent elven mentors. And\
  \ then I put him in a cage match with Channa and observed while she stomped him\
  \ into organic fertilizer.</p> \n   <p>Sometimes the creative process takes interesting\
  \ turns.</p> \n   <p>Once I started thinking seriously about druids, one of Tennyson's\
  \ more famous quatrains came to mind:</p> \n   <blockquote>\n     Who trusted God\
  \ was love indeed \n    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And love Creation's final law— \n\
  \    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tho' Nature, red in tooth and claw \n    <br>With ravine,\
  \ shrieked against his creed— \n   </blockquote> \n   <p>Why should druids embody\
  \ calm serenity and selfless love rather than \"Nature, red in tooth and claw\"\
  ? Surely some druids would be more closely attuned to nature's predators. This notion\
  \ was central to Channa Ti's creation. To her way of thinking, \"A paladin's noble\
  \ steed must eat, but then, so must a crocodile.\"</p> \n   <p>Another inspiration\
  \ came from Pathfinder's ingenious addition to the druid class: the Nature Bond,\
  \ which allows druids to specialize in one of the domains—Air, Animal, Earth, Fire,\
  \ Plant, Water, or Weather—rather than forming a partnership with a companion animal.\
  \ Since Channa is a loner by nature and circumstances, this suited her perfectly.\
  \ An affinity for water also gives her considerable value in a desert clime. An\
  \ expert dowser, she occasionally pays her way as a \"water witch.\" Her ability\
  \ to sense a coming rain is highly valued in a culture that still mourns the passing\
  \ of the Age of Prophecy and is always seeking some way to foresee the future. Finally,\
  \ her affinity with water gives her skills that interest people obsessed with an\
  \ ancient, sea-swallowed realm.</p> \n   <p>Nature Bond offers intriguing potential\
  \ for character development and storytelling, not just for fiction, but also for\
  \ campaign use. For those of you who've never played a druid—and I'm guessing that's\
  \ most of you—the Pathfinder setting is a great place to start.</p> \n   <p>Elaine\
