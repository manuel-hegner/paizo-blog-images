  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">At least this time, Newt\
  \ knew the firestorm he was heading toward.</p> \n     <p>It was Johenn’s fault.\
  \ It was always Johenn’s fault. What was worse, Newt owed him a favor. So when the\
  \ longshank had discovered him in the middle of some research at Forae Logos, the\
  \ largest library in Absalom, the uncharacteristically erudite monkey goblin found\
  \ himself recruited.</p> \n     <p>Within the hour, they returned to the safety\
  \ of the Grand Lodge and made their way into the lowest level of the gardens. Still\
  \ a few too many longshanks to make Newt comfortable, but at least there were fewer\
  \ stares, fewer glares. Here, at least, he knew he belonged, and he had the wayfinder\
  \ to prove it.</p> \n     <p>The first to spot Johenn was a young woman in a fancy,\
  \ blue and white dress, her light brown hair tied in a playful braid at the back\
  \ of her head. Her eyes brightened as she recognized the young man and perked in\
  \ excitement. She did a quick double-take upon seeing Newt, but her attention was\
  \ fast to return to the young man, and her voice rose to greet him.</p> \n     <p>“\
  <em>Please</em> tell me you found it.”</p> \n     <p>Johenn flashed her a playful\
  \ grin as he hopped the last stair, answer in itself. With his usual flair for the\
  \ dramatic, the dark-haired man reached into his long overcoat and revealed a large,\
  \ leather-bound book. He pranced over to where the young woman sat, sweeping the\
  \ journal in an arc to rest before her.</p> \n     <p>“Tonight’s selection for the\
  \ lady,” he crooned as she accepted it. “Hadagaskar’s <em>Recollections on the Lost\
  \ Kingdoms</em>. Might I suggest a pairing of some blackberry wine or perhaps a\
  \ dessert plate?” Not waiting for an answer, he turned his attention to another\
  \ nearby companion. This elder human held himself proudly, his copper-and-white\
  \ beard carefully braided and ringed.</p> \n     <p>Reaching into another pocket\
  \ of his longcoat, Johenn withdrew a scroll case, twirling it expertly in one hand\
  \ before presenting it with a flourish. “And for the distinguished gentleman, a\
  \ light palate cleanser: <em>From [Horn] to [Chair-with-Raised-Staff]: a Refresher\
  \ on Pre-Giant Logograms. Volume 3.</em>”</p> \n     <p>The man nodded, taking the\
  \ scroll case, gently releasing its protective latch and sliding the contents into\
  \ his eager, gnarled hand.</p> \n     <p>“And, my friends, please allow me to introduce\
  \ to you the sharpest mind I know.” Johenn motioned towards the dark blue monkey-goblin.\
  \ “My old friend and adventuring companion, Newt. Newt, might I present to you Lady\
  \ Zaya—“</p> \n     <p>“Just Zaya,” she corrected.</p> \n     <p>“—just Zaya, and\
  \ her beloved hound, Alouicious.” The gray mutt looked up upon hearing his name,\
  \ took quick account of the surroundings, and laid his head back down.</p> \n  \
  \   <p>“Ranger,” Newt said with a nod, and was met with a delighted smile.</p> \n\
  \     <p>“Well spotted,” Johenn grinned. “Our dear lady is with the Horizon Hunters,\
  \ and a forward scout for her team when she is not taking her leisure among us.”\
  </p> \n     <p>Newt was amused to find Zaya rolling her eyes – something which he\
  \ himself had done at Johenn’s dramatics many times.</p> \n     <p>“And our be-robed\
  \ gentleman is Cromberly,” Johenn continued. The elder’s age-clouded eyes were already\
  \ darting eagerly over the scroll; he raised a gnarled hand, distractedly waving\
  \ a greeting.</p> \n     <p>“Cromberly here has a heart for adventure to put shame\
  \ to us all,” Johenn smiled. “And an impressive knack for survival, I hear.“</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“Fine to meet you both,” Newt acknowledged, “but let’s get right to\
  \ the import of it. Johenn’s only started telling me about your mystery, and I’\
  m keen to help. Catch me up.”</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\

  \     <p>Zaya considered where to begin. “We discovered Five Eyes by accident; my\
  \ team was originally sent to the Impossible Lands, off the coast of Jalmeray.”\
  </p> \n     <p>“Following up on Padiskar?” guessed Newt.</p> \n     <p>Zaya chuckled.\
  \ “That’s what Cromberly guessed too. But no, Padiskar’s old news.”</p> \n     <p>Without\
  \ looking up, Cromberly entoned, “Padiskar was built around the ruins there, with\
  \ strict laws and lots of borders to make sure no one intrudes on the creature down\
  \ there. It was even reviewed by the Vigilant Seal and is considered safe for now.”\
  </p> \n     <p>Zaya agreed. “Padiskar’s in the north, and we were off Jalmeray’\
  s southern coast. We were there to investigate an environmental phenomenon: the\
  \ sudden appearance of odd-shaped trees, fully formed and emerging straight from\
  \ under the water.”</p> \n     <p>Newt nearly interrupted with a question, but then\
  \ stopped himself. <em>Impossible Lands</em> indeed.</p> \n     <p>“Their sudden\
  \ arrival attracted a number of pilgrims, who claim the appearance of these trees\
  \ was the dying wish of their old, benevolent god, Five Eyes. The trees themselves\
  \ seem harmless, and the pilgrims have been peaceful. We’re keeping an eye out.\
  \ Since I’m here, I’ve been taking the opportunity to look more into Five Eyes.”\
  \ Zaya lifted the tome Johenn just gave her.</p> \n     <p>Newt nodded thoughtfully,\
  \ his golden eyes shifting to Johenn as the dark-haired man continued the story.\
  \ “I’d really just meant to assist our beautiful ranger in her research” – another\
  \ eyeroll from Zaya – “but, through fate or folly, my own recent adventures seemed\
  \ tied to hers.”</p> \n     <p>He paused for a moment, allowing the silence to stretch.\
  \ And stretch.</p> \n     <p>“Johenn,” Newt said distastefully, waving his hand.\
  \ “Performance later. Details now.”</p> \n     <p>Johenn grinned sheepishly, caught\
  \ in his old habit. “Of course, of course. Forgive me. My most recent assignment\
  \ was in the Menador Mountains, in Old Cheliax. We were sent there to investigate\
  \ some newly-discovered caves in the area. Imagine my surprise when we discovered\
  \ our old <em>friend</em> there.”</p> \n     <p>This time, Newt <em>did</em> understand\
  \ the meaningful pause. He hissed a quiet name. “Alden.”</p> \n     <p>Johenn nodded\
  \ somberly. “Apparently, the Aspis Consortium also heard of this potential find.\
  \ It got….<em>tricky</em>. It became less of a careful expedition and more of a\
  \ race to find and catalogue everything we could before Alden and his team got a\
  \ hold of it or destroyed it.”</p> \n     <p>Newt grumbled, and Johenn nodded empathetically.\
  \ “We’d discovered a series of old cave paintings, sculptures, and inscriptions…\
  \ Newt, it was <em>amazing</em>.”</p> \n     <p>The goblin asked the more pressing\
  \ question: “Was anyone hurt?” <em>Again</em>.</p> \n     <p>Johenn shook his head,\
  \ and Newt released the breath he didn’t remember holding.</p> \n     <p>“It was\
  \ close,” Johenn admitted. “But we got out safely. The fool demolished the cave\
  \ to get at something beyond the wall. We held the area as long as we could, while\
  \ I combined all of our bookthief brew. We copied everything we could, but there\
  \ was so much. It was nearly impossible to figure out which paintings were the most\
  \ important. With a fight incoming, we had to make a lot of guesses. I’d been taking\
  \ tracings of some of the inscriptions, but there wasn’t time to complete them.”\
  </p> \n     <p>“You did well,” the goblin rumbled. “Agents first.”</p> \n     <p>Johenn\
  \ nodded, though Newt could tell that the loss of the information hurt the archivist\
  \ keenly. “We got out with what we could. I made copies of what we were able to\
  \ save with the brew…seems to be a series of writings on an enormous creature…”\
  </p> \n     <p>“…with five eyes,” Newt finished the sentence, guessing. Johenn arched\
  \ his brows in ascent.</p> \n     <p>“Zaya and I have been pooling our resources\
  \ since then. Some of my saved pages caught complete phrases, so we’ve been able\
  \ to translate those. With the rest, well…that’s where Cromberly comes in. He’s\
  \ got a knack for languages.”</p> \n     <p>“Got it,” Newt nodded. “So what do you\
  \ have so far?”</p> \n     <p>“It’s patchy,” admitted Zaya. “Johenn’s team did a\
  \ fantastic job saving what they could. But that still leaves us with only snips\
  \ of information and a lot of guesswork.”</p> \n     <p>Johenn offered his journal\
  \ to Newt. The goblin accepted it and sat down a few paces from Zaya. The monkey-goblin\
  \ grunted as he paged through the scribed, translated pages. “Five Eyes Awakened…\
  mm-hmm…old wrongs set right…unbound, unfettered, unrestricted…the dying wish…”</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“There were a lot of those symbols repeated on the lost cave wall,”\
  \ Johenn offered, reading over the goblin’s shoulder. “Especially mentions of Five\
  \ Eyes, and a lot of repetition about his dying wish.”</p> \n     <p>“Hm. What’\
  s this part here, about ‘no dragon remains, only bones’? And here, where it’s paired\
  \ with the dying wish.” Newt squinted at one of the pages critically, tucking a\
  \ pinky into the book to save his spot while he looked back a few pages. A grunt\
  \ of annoyance passed his lips as he found another passage; his tail snaked around\
  \ to help him hold the extra page.</p> \n     <p>“Hm. Here.” His tail pointed to\
  \ one page. “It’s talking about Five Eyes ending the age of dragonkind. And here,\
  \ again. Is that part of this ‘dying wish?’ Or was that maybe how he himself died…\
  ?”</p> \n     <p>“I’m not sure,” Zaya admitted.</p> \n     <p>“It all reads like\
  \ a prophecy,” grunted Newt, the last word dripping, poisonous.</p> \n     <p>“\
  Well. At least <em>that</em> would be nothing to worry about,” chuckled Johenn with\
  \ a sardonic smile. “Prophecies are reliably unreliable these days.”</p> \n    \
  \ <p>“True,” acknowledged Cromberly, finally looking up from his scrolls. “But it’\
  d be folly to ignore what we found, even if it’s a legend we’re researching. The\
  \ sudden trees in Jalmeray means <em>something’s</em> happening. Best if we went\
  \ in prepared.”</p> \n     <p>Newt nodded and continued paging through Johenn’s\
  \ sketches. Something nagged at him. “Tell me more about the trees you discovered,\
  \ Zaya.”</p> \n     <p>The woman nodded, reaching into her satchel and drawing out\
  \ her own field notebook. “The trees were petrified. Each had its own root system\
  \ extending below the water, with tendrils lost in the ocean floor.” She turned\
  \ a page. “All these trees had a spiraling grain along the wood, but each spiral\
  \ was grown over itself. It looked like veins, really.”</p> \n     <p>Zaya turned\
  \ another page and flipped the book around to show Newt a rough sketch. “None of\
  \ the trees had any growth or sign of life. Just…a copse of petrified, swirling\
  \ trees.”</p> \n     <p>Newt blinked a few times. “I don’t know if you meant to\
  \ do so, but your sketch certainly makes those trees look like pointed teeth to\
  \ me.”</p> \n     <p><em>Root System. Veins. Teeth.</em></p> \n     <p>And that\
  \ was what he needed to remember. He snapped his fingers. “Several months ago, I\
  \ was part of an investigative crew in the thick of the Mwangi Expanse. We were\
  \ looking into the theft of relics from a local museum. The thieves completely bypassed\
  \ some of the more obvious and lucrative targets, instead opting to take the petrified\
  \ remains of an ancient, mostly unknown creature.”</p> \n     <p>“What did you learn\
  \ about it?” prompted Cromberly.</p> \n     <p>“There were more questions than answers.\
  \ The display was of several petrified teeth the length of a human arm, and a few,\
  \ sharp-ended scales that belonged to a creature only called <em>Ko’kquali</em>,\
  \ so named for the formation of its teeth. There wasn’t much more to learn about\
  \ it – it’s largely a mystery – but professors believed the creature to be the apex\
  \ predator of its time, feasting on dragons as easily as today’s dragons feast on\
  \ sheep.”</p> \n     <p>“Oh, my.” Cromberly had grown pale</p> \n     <p>“I see\
  \ your friend speaks the dialect,” the goblin ventured. </p> \n     <p>Nodding,\
  \ Cromberly spoke up. “Ko’kquali. Five <em>points</em>. Not eyes.”</p> \n     <p>“\
  So…” Johenn swallowed. “So hear me out here. It seems like Zaya here discovered\
  \ a newly-formed place, set for worship by pilgrims for Five Eyes. A place that\
  \ looks like petrified, stony teeth.”</p> \n     <p>Zaya nodded.</p> \n     <p>“\
  Some ancient remnants of an old creature that <em>ate dragons for a teatime snack</em>\
  \ have been stolen. And that creature was named Five Points.”</p> \n     <p>Newt\
  \ nodded.</p> \n     <p>“…and my team just found a whole bunch of cave paintings\
  \ – literally writing on the wall! – about Five Eyes, how the age of dragonkind\
  \ will come to an end, and how there’s some dying wish.”</p> \n     <p>A long silence\
  \ hung over the agents. Johenn reached for his journal, and Newt handed it back\
  \ wordlessly. </p> \n     <p>Johenn lifted the book and asked one last, quiet question.\
  \ “What if this isn’t a legend, isn’t a prophecy… What if these are <em>instructions</em>?”\
  </p> \n     <p>Newt cleared his dry throat. “Then I’d say that we have a long journey\
  \ ahead of us, Johenn. Let’s get the word out, and then we have a lot of answers\
  \ to find. And <em>quickly</em>. Before we find out what the Dying Wish can do to\
  \ Golarion.”</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p style=\"font-weight: bold; line-height:\
