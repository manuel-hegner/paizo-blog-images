  \ this isn’t in Ustalav, Mios thought, smiling wryly to themself as they approached\
  \ the Lily Lounge. It hadn’t taken much investigating into the recent mysterious\
  \ disappearances in Augustana to find all signs pointing to this new luxury lounge,\
  \ famous almost overnight. <em>If this were Ustalav</em>, Mios figured, <em>the\
  \ lodge would be full of vampires. Or werewolves. Or some kind of vampiric werewolves\
  \ like those vukodlaks from last winter</em>.</p> \n      <p>The Lily Lounge’s clientele,\
  \ at least the ones who hadn’t been disappearing, tended towards the wealthy; after\
  \ all, it advertised itself as a luxurious resting place for valiant hunters returning\
  \ from their hunts. Though Andoran claimed to not have any nobles (<em>technically\
  \ true</em>), many of these clients were just that in all but name. The real trouble\
  \ is that the lounge was reported to also let in the less well to do… who would\
  \ then go missing. Not at the lounge, though, and not right away. Whoever was responsible,\
  \ likely the owners, weren’t that sloppy. No, these poorer clients were always seen\
  \ afterwards for some time but mysteriously disappeared within a fortnight, often\
  \ alongside reports of erratic behavior. <em>Even odds it’s enchantment magic forcing\
  \ the victim to kidnap themselves</em>, Mios thought, <em>or maybe this is the one\
  \ time it actually IS a doppelganger replacing them at the lounge</em>.</p> \n \
  \     <p>Regardless, the place was highly suspicious. Though Mios could tell that\
  \ the lounge’s secrets were rather well-hidden by anyone else’s standards, little\
  \ things gave it away to their trained eye. <em>Heliotrope planted at the four corners\
  \ of the lot, to divert close attention. Structure offset slightly from cardinal\
  \ directions, subtly separating building from external expectations to decrease\
  \ guard</em>. It even extended to the proprietors—thought of highly, but only ever\
  \ in the vaguest of terms—even Mios couldn’t discover much about one Gilbert Zoon\
  \ (the lounge’s founder) or his business partner Sabricia (last name unknown). They’\
  d been seen out during the day, though, so at least they weren’t vampires. And nothing\
  \ was timed around the full moon…. Mios reflexively reached out and touched the\
  \ old wound on their leg, another reminder of the past, and what it meant to let\
  \ down one’s guard. Memories like these were why Mios never regretted leaving Ustalav\
  \ behind. Here in Andoran, what was the worst it could be? <em>No</em>, Mios thought\
  \ as they reflexively formed a turning-away sign, <em>better not to jinx it</em>.\
  \ Some of the old superstitions died hard.</p> \n      <p>Their reminiscence was\
  \ broken by an incoming party of young hunters—just the chance Mios had been waiting\
  \ for. They waited until the hunters had just entered, then adjusted their wolf\
  \ pelt, held their back straight, and walked forward like they owned the lodge.\
  \ They’d seen enough nobles in their life that it was easy to put on airs. At the\
  \ door, Mios made some small talk with the staff before being invited in. <em>Pupil\
  \ dilation normal, good recall of earlier events, able to respond to abstract questions</em>.\
  \ The staff didn’t seem to be under any form of direct mind control, though they\
  \ did seem a bit tense.</p> \n      <p>After a day or two casing the Lily Lounge,\
  \ Mios had decided the front door would be better than sneaking in a window or cellar,\
  \ which would almost certainly be trapped or magically defended against break-ins.\
  \ <em>Threshold magic—versatile, but dependent on intent</em>. If the owner’s intent\
  \ was toward privacy, the magic could help reinforce a boundary between the outside\
  \ and inside. It was the same principle when creating a circle of salt to ward off\
  \ a ghost—create a boundary, then give it authority. <em>But you can’t bar a door\
  \ that you’ve opened yourself, like the front door. Let alone put greeters at</em>.\
  \ Even vampires can freely enter a public building. The staff smiled at Mios, and\
  \ they walked in.</p> \n      <p>As Mios entered, two beads on their wrist pulsed\
  \ once with subtle light, and a tarnished coin on their waist spun slightly. The\
  \ building <em>had</em> been highly warded, then—but Mios had made it through easily.\
  \ They absconded down a hallway, away from guests and staff, and reached out an\
  \ empty hand. <em>Ownership is never broken by mere distance, only a change in relationship</em>.\
  \ As Mios concentrated on the truism, they felt a familiar weight through their\
  \ glove. When they looked down at their hand again, their lantern shone in it, and\
  \ in its light, once-invisible defenses crisscrossed the walls and doors. Mios peered\
  \ at an especially warded door. <em>Sarkorian abjuration, but corrupted. Strange\
  \ to see that so far south</em>. It suggested demonic influence, or someone familiar\
  \ with the Worldwound and its closing. Mios shifted their usual silver blade to\
  \ a back sheath, replacing it with one of cold-forged iron, just in case. With a\
  \ bit of effort—more than it usually took—Mios dismantled the wards, opened the\
  \ door, and crept down the hallway beyond.</p> \n      <p>Passing nondescript private\
  \ suites, Mios’s lantern light eventual fell upon a door covered up entirely by\
  \ an illusion. Curious, since there was no sign of this wing from the outside. <em>Extradimensional,\
  \ or just a massive illusion</em>? Mios slipped into the room to find out. <em>Ah,\
  \ the classic trapdoor leading down</em>. That explained it. Maybe just mundane\
  \ architectural tricks then. The chamber below was furnished in fine silk, imported\
  \ wood, and elegant paintings, easily the most grandiose and opulent part of the\
  \ lounge… but in the lantern’s light, the facade melted away. The entire place was\
  \ a dismal cavern with clear demonic magic coursing through it. Well, clear to Mios.\
  \ Surely the victims had been fooled. The thaumaturge drew their iron blade.</p>\

  \      <br> \n      <p>As Mios turned the corner, their light shone on two figures\
  \ who must have been the owners, though no sooner did the light reach them than\
  \ their true forms were revealed. The man, now a hideous creature with claws and\
  \ a carapace, shrieked in pain and flinched backwards from the light. Weak to light…\
  \ no, not to light. <em>Treachery demon. Harmed by truth</em>. An incredibly dangerous\
  \ threat for the unsuspecting citizenry of Augustana, but Mios began to grin; they\
  \ were just about the worst possible match-up the demon could face. The thaumaturge\
  \ reached into one of their many pouches, riffling for a bit before settling on\
  \ a dried chrysanthemum. They passed the flower through the flame of their lantern\
  \ and smeared the ash on their pick. They felt the concepts align, felt the tension\
  \ of forces coming to oppose each other: against an unnatural creature of treachery\
  \ cloaked in falsehoods, present an object of the natural world, symbolizing honesty,\
  \ tempered in the light of truth. Three properties from the demon, three from Mios.\
  \ </p> \n      <p>Their pick thrummed with power as the creatures howled. Time to\
  \ get to work.</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p style=\"font-weight: bold; line-height:\
