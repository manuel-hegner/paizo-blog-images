  >We're in the thrall of the summer convention season here at Paizo, with employees\
  \ spread hither and yon across the globe at conventions near and far. In the last\
  \ two weeks, we've had employees at Comicpalooza in Texas, UK Games Expo in Birmingham,\
  \ KublaCon in San Francisco, and Book Expo America in New York City. Yours truly\
  \ was at the last two, and in the ensuing fracas there was a bit of confusion here\
  \ at Paizo regarding the Friday preview blog. In short, we completely missed last\
  \ week, and the week before got posted in a super-secret ninja way that kept it\
  \ hidden from sight for all but the cleverest members of the paizo.com community.</span></p>\
  \ \n     <p>We've since fixed the link, so if you haven't yet had a chance to check\
  \ out <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lg53\">the three \"Leapin' Lizards\" I posted\
  \ on the 23rd</a>, now is an excellent time to do so.</p> \n     <p>But conventions\
  \ are good for more than just boring internal business miscommunications. They also\
  \ bring special promotional figures for you to enjoy! Jason Bulmahn, Jenny Bendel,\
  \ the Adventure Card Game team, and I are headed to the <a href=\"http://originsgamefair.com/\"\
  >Origins Game Fair</a> in Columbus next week to show off the new <a href=\"/products/btpy92zj\"\
  >Skull &amp; Shackles Adventure Card Game</a> set and to play some Pathfinder Society\
  \ games. Both the Adventure Card Game demos in Hall D and the Pathfinder Society\
  \ HQ in the PFS room will feature the debut of this year's first Pathfinder Battles\
  \ Promotional Figure, the Hellfire Wisp!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\
  \ <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71576_HellWisp.jpg\"> <img src=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71576_HellWisp_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"> </a>\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>This exciting figure is based on the Will-o'-Wisp figure\
  \ from the recent <a href=\"/products/btpy91pu\">Wrath of the Righteous</a> set.\
  \ Reviews of the set so far have declared the Will-o'-Wisp one of our most exciting\
  \ figures to date, with a neat skull visible through clear blue plastic. For the\
  \ Hellfire Wisp variant, we've changed the clear plastic to a red tint, adding an\
  \ extra bit of diabolical fun to the figure. We'll be giving away the figure to\
  \ PFS players and card game demoers at Origins, and it will likely make a return\
  \ appearance at future conventions this year, such as Gen Con and PAX Prime. After\
  \ the convention season, remaining figures will appear for sale on paizo.com for\
  \ folks who are not able to meet up with us out in the wider world. (Don't worry,\
  \ we'll set aside a few early to make sure that at least some of them end up for\
  \ sale here on the site.)</p> \n     <p>Speaking of promo figures, the 10 promotional\
  \ repaint figures based on creatures from the <a href=\"/products/btpy8yqx\">Emerald\
  \ Spire Superdungeon</a> will head out from our warehouse to backers of the Pathfinder\
  \ Online Kickstarter project later this month. It's possible that very few of these\
  \ extremely rare sets will remain after we have fulfilled all of the Kickstarter\
  \ rewards, but at this point it appears that most of them are headed to project\
  \ backers as originally intended. I'll drop a note here if any slip through the\
  \ cracks and go on general sale at paizo.com.</p> \n     <p>We'll be back to a full\
  \ preview of Pathfinder Battles figures from the upcoming <a href=\"/products/btpy96kb\"\
  >Lost Coast</a> set next week, but this week I want to keep the focus on promotional\
  \ items above and beyond the Pathfinder Battles line. </p> \n     <p>Last up this\
  \ week is a sneak peek at a project I've been spending a LOT of time on over the\
  \ last several months—Pathfinder Minimates!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  > <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/DIAPZOJUN142089.jpg\"> <img src=\"/image/content/Blog/DIAPZOJUN142089_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"> </a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Pathfinder Minimates are small, 2-inch\
  \ collectible toy figures produced by our partners at Art Asylum and Diamond Select\
  \ Toys. The picture above features the four debut figures in our Pathfinder Minimates\
  \ mass market range—<a href=\"/products/btpy9797\">Merisiel, Harsk, Valeros, and\
  \ a Goblin</a>! The first four-pack is scheduled for an October release.</p> \n\
  \     <p>Pathfinder Minimates are built to the same scale as the more than 1700\
  \ Minimates Diamond Select Toys has already produced for licenses like Marvel Comics,\
  \ Big Bang Theory, Pulp Fiction, and more. All of the pieces—from their weapons\
  \ to their hair to their hands—are completely interchangeable, meaning you can have\
  \ a field day giving Valeros Merisiel's hair, or giving Harsk's axe to Deadpool.\
  \ Their feet also scale perfectly to work with Lego building blocks, making them\
  \ a fun addition to the little castles filling the game rooms of builders young\
  \ and old.</p> \n     <p>I've seen the first four Pathfinder figures in hand, and\
  \ they look fantastic. Valeros and Merisiel have working scabbards, and the goblin\
  \ is the spitting image of Wayne Reynolds's art (and yet still remains a distinctively\
  \ Minimate-like). They look phenomenal, and I'm sure a lot of you will get a kick\
  \ out of playing with them.</p> \n     <p>That said, the first set will not be ready\
  \ until October, which is well after the summer convention season. SO, given that,\
  \ I've worked with Diamond Select Toys to create at least TWELVE additional Pathfinder\
  \ Minimates that we plan to debut at this year's Gen Con in Indianapolis, both as\
  \ promotional items and as for-sale two-figure packs. While I can't yet show off\
  \ any images of these bonus figures, I've put a lot of thought and care into deciding\
  \ what we should include in the line, and I'm certain you'll be pleased with my\
  \ choices.</p> \n     <p>Watch this space in future months for a look at these exciting\
  \ new Pathfinder toys, and come back next week for another adventure into the treacherous\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy96kb\">Lost Coast</a> set of Pathfinder Battles miniatures.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>See you at Origins!</p> \n     <p>Erik Mona<br \\> <i>Publisher</i></p>\
