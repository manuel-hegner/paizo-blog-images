  >“Whirp–click?” the tiny construct asked of Droven, who rotated the lenses of a\
  \ pair of clockwork glasses he’d been tinkering with.</p> \n      <p>“Hush now,\
  \ little Whirp.” The half-orc placed a hand on the construct’s metal head. Farther\
  \ down the beach—just within range of what the inventor could see through the darkness\
  \ of early evening—a noisome band of pirates and smugglers gathered around a cooking\
  \ fire obstructed by enough foliage to remain hidden from passing ships. The flames\
  \ made it hard for Droven to calibrate his goggles as he looked on from the northern\
  \ flank.</p> \n      <p>“Wreckers,\" Droven said quietly. The nomads had warned\
  \ him about them—and for good reason. Just beyond the campfire, a half dozen captives\
  \ remained locked inside a stockade. The structure looked sturdy, despite being\
  \ crafted from driftwood and detritus collected from the beach. Many of the prisoners\
  \ had been hog-tied. Others were yoked in makeshift stocks.</p> \n      <p>“I believe\
  \ the Wreckers caught bigger fish than they meant to fry,” Droven said, adjusting\
  \ his position. “Someone must have stripped and dumped the bodies we found near\
  \ the tree line. I bet the smugglers ambushed the prisoners and overpowered them,\
  \ but not before several were lost in the fray.” He exhaled. “Which would mean they\
  \ desecrated the bodies of their own compatriots. Not much of a retirement plan\
  \ if you ask me.”</p> \n      <p>“Bzzzzt–click” Whirp said, tugging desperately\
  \ at the inventor’s arm. Droven didn’t need months exploring the Arcadian coastline\
  \ with the construct to know what that meant. He dropped his goggles and spun to\
  \ draw his hammer as Whirp gestured frantically toward the small hillock’s only\
  \ safe pathway. Someone had snuck near their position, leaving obvious tracks behind.\
  \ Droven glanced over his shoulder. The drop was too far to know whether he could\
  \ leap down to the sands below and keep his footing.</p> \n      <p>“Ho there! I\
  \ warn you; I am armed and no easy prey. Allow me to negotiate for the release of\
  \ your prisoners and the cessation of attacks against the ships passing by this\
  \ shoreline. Otherwise, prepare for battle!”</p> \n      <p>A pair of Wrecker scouts\
  \ stepped out from the underbrush. A woman outstretched her arm to reveal a spider\
  \ with barbed fur clamped around her wrist like a living gauntlet. The puckering\
  \ spinneret twitched toward Droven, causing the inventor to tighten his grip on\
  \ the hammer. The weapon was almost certainly a beast gun. He’d seen enough of them\
  \ to know it possessed the abilities of the spider whose body it was constructed\
  \ from. If he didn’t act first, he and Whirp would be enveloped in spiderweb and\
  \ rolled down the embankment. Some heroes they would be—wrapped up like two helpless\
  \ caterpillars in silk cocoons.</p> \n      <p>Droven whistled sharply and dropped\
  \ to his stomach. Whirp planted its spindly arms in the dirt and somersaulted toward\
  \ the Wreckers, just before detonating in a roiling ball of flame. The inventor\
  \ had rigged the little construct to explode on command, knowing it would survive\
  \ the blast largely unharmed. The same could not be said of the two smugglers who\
  \ rolled on the ground to extinguish their burning clothes. Droven rushed forward\
  \ and struck each of their skulls with the hammer, holding back just enough of his\
  \ strength to leave them alive. At least, he hoped. Neither strike had drawn much\
  \ blood.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/a341e7d8-a2b4-4673-94e6-bd84e074b877/PZO2109_InventorHalfPage_2000.jpg\"\

  \ companion, Whirp, spews a gout of flame at his enemies in this exciting illustration\

  \ \n      <p>It was only a matter of time before the explosion attracted other Wreckers,\
  \ though with any luck the crest of the hillock obscured most of the remaining flames.\
  \ Droven kicked sand over the parts of the smugglers that still smoldered and bound\
  \ them with lengths of spare wire. He and Whirp had better move fast. But not before\
  \ he snatched the spidery beast gun which had been so kindly gifted to them.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>“Point and click, right, Whirp?” Droven snapped the weapon in place\
  \ atop his forearm, suppressing a grimace as its tiny hairs pricked his skin.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>The sounds of shouting in the distance grew louder. The inventor tapped\
  \ Whirp on the shoulder, signaling the construct to collapse into a light carrying\
  \ case. Droven scooped up his companion by its clockwork arm-turned-handle and dashed\
  \ into the trees. </p> \n      <p>Sliding behind some foliage, Droven steadied his\
  \ stolen weapon on top of the little construct’s condensed body. Two triggers protruded\
  \ from the abdomen of the taxidermic spider. He was reasonably confident that depressing\
  \ the first would fire a net of silk webbing. He had no inkling about the second.\
  \ There was only one way to find out. </p> \n      <p>As the first Wrecker came\
  \ into sight, Droven pulled the first trigger—only to discover the absurdity of\
  \ his assumption. A barbed hair launched from the spider and stabbed the pirate\
  \ in the neck. The smuggler collapsed to the ground in spastic convulsions just\
  \ before growing still. Droven moved to the body, placing his hand on the Wrecker’\
  s neck. No pulse. Droven struggled against the dread coalescing in the pit of his\
  \ stomach. As much as the inventor detested unnecessary violence, his foe had undoubtedly\
  \ met the same fate as the many innocent victims who crossed the pirates’ path.\
  \ Perhaps he could find some solace in that.</p> \n      <p>When the next smuggler\
  \ came into sight, Droven pulled the second trigger. The beast gun fired the webbing\
  \ he’d expected before, provoking a sigh of relief. The web spiraled outward from\
  \ the beast gun, pinning the Wrecker to a nearby tree as it wrapped circles around\
  \ the trunk. As the pirate pleaded for someone to cut him free, Droven realized\
  \ he and his companion could soon find themselves outnumbered. He tapped Whirp once\
  \ more and the tiny construct unfolded into its bipedal form. Pulling a pair of\
  \ boots sized for the construct out of his backpack, Droven quickly fitted them\
  \ onto Whirp’s stubby legs.</p> \n      <p>“Lead them on a merry chase and then\
  \ meet me at their bonfire. Understood?”</p> \n      <p>“Whirrrrrrrpup–click–whirrrrrr!”\
  \ the construct said in response, slamming its tiny heels together to activate the\
  \ blast boots. Whirp rocketed skyward through the trees; its path lit by twin tails\
  \ of flame. </p> \n      <p>Droven moved quickly through the woods, heading toward\
  \ the Wreckers’ bonfire and, most importantly, the stockade. When he arrived at\
  \ camp, he slowed to sneak carefully behind the pair of guards who remained. As\
  \ he moved, he pictured the rest of the Wreckers struggling to keep up as they chased\
  \ the flash of Whirp’s fiery trail through the darkness. He smiled and shifted his\
  \ hammer to his prosthetic hand. Droven rapped both pirates with a single flourish\
  \ that would have been all but impossible with a limb comprised of flesh and blood.\
  \ His last remaining enemies slumped to the ground unceremoniously, knocked cold.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Droven dashed toward the prison. After releasing a small blade integrated\
  \ into his metal arm, he slashed through the ropes that tied the door shut. He moved\
  \ toward the nearest prisoner: a cleric bearing a silver symbol of Sarenrae who\
  \ had been muffled with a cloth gag. Droven slid his blade softly under the fabric,\
  \ gently enough to avoid piercing the prisoner’s cheek, and pulled. He cut her free\
  \ just in time to make out, “–hind you!”</p> \n      <p>Droven turned to behold\
  \ his grave mistake. Three Wreckers remained behind, not two. The pirate Droven\
  \ failed to spot had her own beast gun, this one made from the neck and maw of a\
  \ fire-breathing drake.</p> \n      <p>“Oi! Drop the gun!” the woman shouted.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Hoping not to alarm her, Droven disconnected the spider gun from his\
  \ arm and let it fall to the ground.</p> \n      <p>“Thought you could steal from\
  \ the Wreckers, eh? ‘Fraid we’re going to have to make an example out of you! Any\
  \ last words?” She leveled the drake gun at Droven. </p> \n      <p>Droven couldn’\
  t help but glance toward the sky. Some twenty feet above the Wrecker, two thin lines\
  \ of fire bisected the night sky. </p> \n      <p>“Last words? Why, yes, I do have\
  \ some.” Droven stifled a grin. “I’m afraid that you failed to account… for the\
  \ powerful bond of friendship!” As the inventor yelled, he activated a large magnet\
  \ attached to a disposable electric reservoir in his prosthetic arm. The magnetic\
  \ force drew Whirp—who hovered above he and the Wrecker thanks to the blast boots\
  \ Droven had fitted the construct with—down toward the inventor’s arm.</p> \n  \
  \    <p>The smuggler fired, unleashing a blast of flame from her drake gun. But\
  \ it was too late. The little construct twisted its metallic body and absorbed the\
  \ brunt of the explosion, shielding Droven from harm.</p> \n      <p>Droven remembered\
  \ the blade on his prosthetic hand. Just before he moved to strike, a thunderous\
  \ explosion forced him to duck behind Whirp. When he peaked back over the construct’\
  s shoulder, the Wrecker lie prone, screaming, and thrashing—totally enveloped in\
  \ flame. Despite burning alive, she staggered to her feet and pointed the drake\
  \ gun once more—first at Whirp, then at Droven.</p> \n      <p>A small figure stepped\
  \ out of the shadows behind her, holding a vial of alchemist’s fire in hand. Droven’\
  s jaw dropped in disbelief.</p> \n      <p>\"Fumbus?\" he coughed. “Where did you\
  \ come from?” But Droven heard no words in response.</p> \n      <p>Just another\
  \ boom. </p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p style=\"font-weight: bold; line-height:\
