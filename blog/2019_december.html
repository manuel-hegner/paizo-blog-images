                <p>For me, this was the third year of major program releases. In 2017, we spun up Starfinder Society. Besides ramping up Starfinder Society to full production in 2018, we launched the Pathfinder Playtest, which had some significant Society components, and gathered information about the status of Organized Play and opinions of our community. The launch of Pathfinder (second edition) in 2019 involved a complete reboot of the Pathfinder Society, including some new programs, as well as a major shake-up in our team membership. As far as 2020, I look forward to a year of settling in and polishing our processes.</p> 
                <p>We still have wrinkles to work out with several of the program changes, but I’m confident we can get to where we need to be. Every day brings new challenges and experiences, but I wouldn’t have it any other way. Four and one-third years in, I’m happy to be working with one of the best team in Paizo and can’t wait to see what 2020 brings!</p> 
                <p>Next week, we will have our first “Spotlights, Stars, and Cons” blog of 2020! Tune in to see what our community’s been up to in December and our plans for 2020!</p>

                <hr width="75%"> 
                <p><i>From Linda —</i><br> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/product/catalog/PZO/PZO6040.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/product/catalog/PZO/PZO6040.jpg" width="25%" align="right" hspace="5"></a> 2019 was a big year for the Pathfinder Adventure Card Society (formerly known as the Pathfinder Adventure Card Guild). After plenty of play experience and fan feedback, the designers of the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game came out with a revised <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01ws7?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Core-Set">Core Set</a>, as well as an expansion for the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01ws8?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Curse-of-the-Crimson-Throne-Adventure-Path">Curse of the Crimson Throne</a> Adventure Path. These new boxes come with detailed stories and plenty of customization, from ways to alter the difficulty of scenarios to a full-on custom adventure builder. And as the organized play team looked what the new set had to offer, we looked for ways that we could expand our offerings. We realized—Pathfinder Society and Starfinder Society have a tradition of creating ways for players to receive organized play credit for Paizo’s other adventures, so why not the Pathfinder Adventure Card Society as well? So we opened these rules up to organized play, including the custom adventure builder. We’ve also started looking at releasing more short adventures, like the Season of the Kobolds that came out at PaizoCon, and the multi-tiered standalone adventure A Night at Blackthorne Manor that will be coming out next month. In terms of the main storyline, we closed out the Year of Tapestry’s Tides at PaizoCon and then launched the Year of Rotting Ruin at Gen Con. Tapestry’s Tides started with the PCs as vanguards in the RPG/card game crossover special The Hao Jin Cataclysm; that is, until the PCs got pulled into a dangerous pocket dimension.</p> 
                <p>One of the best parts about working on stories for the Pathfinder Adventure Card Society is that it’s so much easier to take the adventure into perilous or wacky locations. If you (hypothetically) want to offer your players a chance to set aside their better judgement and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01x99?Pathfinder-Society-Adventure-Card-Guild-5P1-Titans-Rampage">provoke the wrath of a kaiju</a>, you can. And that’s not even the most over-the-top part of the season. Tapestry’s Tides was also a great chance to delve into more Tian Xia lore, traveling to multiple locations that haven’t appeared in a previous Paizo adventure. And when Tapestry’s Tides came to a close, we decided to run with a massive story hook left in Tyrant’s Grasp, where that Adventure Path’s PCs travel elsewhere and Pathfinder agents are among the heroes to battle the terrors left behind in the undead-blighted Gravelands. </p> 
                <p>On the Pathfinder Society side, my favorite projects that I’ve worked on are the twin finales to the Pathfinder Society campaign in Pathfinder First Edition: The Passing the Torch series for Tier 12-18 (<a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01yz0?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-1022-Passing-the-Torch-Part-1-Who-Wears-the-Mask">Part 1: Who Wears the Mask</a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01yz1?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-1023-Passing-the-Torch-Part-2-Who-Speaks-for-the-Ten">Part 2: Who Speaks for the Ten</a>) and the Tier 5–16 interactive special <a href="" https: paizo.com store pathfinder society season10>#10-98: Siege of Gallowspire</a>. I’ve been invested in the First Edition Pathfinder Society campaign since Season 2, and it was a privilege to shape these capstone stories. We got the chance to pay off plots years in the making. These scenarios are stories of destruction and renewal, of meaningful choices. They gave us a chance to try out new ideas that really only work in a campaign with the weight of years behind it, from super-high level adventuring to mechanics that allow multiple PCs per player to work together against overwhelming odds. </p> 
                <p>I could ramble on for a while about how excited I am about Pathfinder Society in Second Edition, and about the Plans™ we’ve got cooking for Starfinder Society, but I should leave that to other folks to keep this blog to a somewhat reasonable length. Before I go though, I’d like to acknowledge the person who has been a bedrock member of the Organized Play team for years, and who moved over to the Starfinder team after Gen Con: John Compton. John has played a pivotal role in many of the improvements that you’ve seen in our organized play campaigns in recent years. He taught me how to be a developer and prepared me to take over as Organized Play Lead Developer when he left. Though he has flown away to the stars, I’m confident that our team will continue to flourish, and I’m excited to show you what we have in store for 2020!</p>

                <p><i>Michael’s musings —</i><br>Is 2019 really over? I feel like it’s mostly just a blur of text and art orders with the occasional packed convention breaking things up! With rolling out a new edition and overhauling just about every aspect of the Pathfinder Society campaign this year we’ve been up to our elbows in development and meetings. Despite (because?) of all that, it was a really good year and I’m happy about a lot of what we’ve accomplished. If you’ve been following our Pathfinder Society quests and scenarios, you’ve probably noticed that we’ve been constantly responding to the input from all of our GMs and volunteer coordinators out there to introduce new convenience tools and refine the tools we’ve been using. We’ve got a detailed list of where the treasures are hidden for the GM to make sure players are getting everything they’ve earned, new appendices to speed up encounter running, checkpoints sprinkled throughout the adventures to remind GMs of when they should be giving out Hero Points, and at least half a dozen other things that aren’t leaping to my mind right now in these final minutes before I head out for a very long weekend.</p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/product/catalog/PZOP/PZOPFQ0004E.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/product/catalog/PZOP/PZOPFQ0004E.jpg" width="25%" hspace="5" align="right"></a> 
                <p>It’s been my privilege to see the PF2 adventures that authors new and old have brought to life based on the outlines put together by this amazing organized play team, including some personal favorites like our new org play developer James Case’s <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq021xi?Pathfinder-Society-Quest-4-Port-Peril-Pub-Crawl">Port Peril Pub Crawl</a> and editor Leo Glass’s <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq0217m?Pathfinder-Society-Quest-2-Unforgiving-Fire">Unforgiving Fire</a>, both of which are part of our new monthly quest line. I got to see an NPC I helped shepherd into existence when I first started at Paizo take center stage when Dolok Darkfur (who first debuted in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9zk2?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-918-Scourge-of-the-Farheavens">Scourge of the Farheavens</a> by Jason Owen Black) appeared in our web fiction story <a hred="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgoe?Tales-of-Lost-Omens-Far-From-Heaven">Far From Heaven</a>. I got to introduce the whole world to my good friend <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgiq?Meet-the-Iconics-Fumbus">Fumbus</a>. I’m realizing as I go through this list that I’m not even halfway through, so leave it that my second year working for Paizo was filled with even more stories and opportunities than my first.</p> 
                <p>This has been an awesome ride and I really can’t tell you all how excited I am for what the next year is going to bring. Tonya, Linda, James, Thursty and I have deep into not just getting the rest of this season rolling towards the finish line, but also laying the groundwork for some really cool stuff over the next two seasons of the Pathfinder Society organized play program and beyond. Fair warning, I’m going to be responsible for the deaths of some NPCs some of you are fond of. With any luck I’ll also be responsible for introducing a few new ones you’ll like as well! The one thing I can guarantee is that we’re going to keep trying new types of adventures and stories as we explore the new opportunities created by the rules framework of Pathfinder second edition. We’re going to build castles and defend them from undead hordes. We’re going to slay dragons, travel to places no one in Paizo or the Pathfinder Society has ever been, and we’re going to meet old friends and maybe a few old enemies who’ve been dodging justice for awhile now. We’re going to have a lot of adventures, and I’m close my piece by reiterating how awesome it is to share those adventures with the amazing community of volunteers and fans who help us keep creating them. You’re all awesome.</p>

                <p><i>From James —</i><br> Hi everyone, the year (and decade) is over! Since I joined the department only about a month ago, I don’t have quiiiiite as much to report on in OP news for the year. <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq022bt?Pathfinder-Society-Quest-5-The-Dragon-Who-Stole-Evoking-Day%5D">The Dragon Who Stole Evoking Day</a>, by Paizo’s own Luis Loza, which was a fun first project to work on, with festive fireworks and holiday cheer. Looking to the future, I can’t wait for <font color="red"><b>[[REDACTED]]</b></font> next year, which features one of my favorite creatures, or <font color="red"><b>[[REDACTED REDACTED REDACTED]]</b></font>, which will introduce a new NPC who’s sure to be a thorn in the PCs’ side. More than anything, I’m excited to get to know everyone who’s helped us bring stories to life and continue to expand the worlds we all share. </p>

               <blockquote> 
                <p itemprop="description">The Tempering: a time of travel for any kasatha reaching maturity, when the young adult seeks out new experiences, and in doing so, discovers himself. Some accept exciting internships, and others join crews to travel beyond the stars—proud, noble, traditional stuff. It was lost within this wistful self-reflection that Tahja gradually regained consciousness following his accidental dive off a skybridge, his fall unceremoniously broken by a dumpster. In his dawning lucidity, he gazed about and wondered.</p> 
                <p><i>“How did you end up here?”</i></p> 
                <p>Tahja reflexively jumped, or tried to, instead slipping on a lumpy trash bag below. The question mirrored his own thoughts, yet it wasn’t his own. In his scramble for stability, he looked up and locked eyes with a shocked shirren, her compound eyes bulging slightly in alarm at his sudden movements.</p> 
                <p>“Whoa, hey, hang on, calm down! Too much telepathy? Fine, hey—unarmed, see?” She raised her two main arms, splaying her three fingers and rattling her neck barbules in alarm. After a few tense seconds, she continued with her reedy voice. “That was quite a fall. You okay? Need an ambulance?”</p> 
                <p>“No. No authorities,” Tahja gasped, using his lower arms to sit up while his uppers straightened his mouth scarf. “I need somewhere to hide.” With a glance upward toward the twisting, towering skyscraper cast in late afternoon light, he added, “Just for a few hours, until sundown.”</p> 
                <p>The shirren’s antennae bobbed with amusement. “Oh wow, you really hit your head. Sundown? You know you’re on Verces, right? Tidally locked? Always the same time of day?” She cocked a claw toward the nearby skyscraper as Tahja’s eyes widened in confusion. “Hell, this is Building 5 for the Nabokon Broadcasting Network.” She punctuated the announcement by tapping the sewn patch on her coveralls. “It’s been late afternoon here since the Gap—perfect hour for filming drama.”</p> 
                <p>Verces. Nabokon. Tahja tried to remember his cultural training. That put him somewhere in the nation Kashak, known for its cybernetics research and heavily augmented populace. That also put him a long way from Absalom Station. The last he remembered, he’d been early in his Tempering on the station, short on credits, and several pages deep into the contracts for a short pharmaceutical testing gig. He figured he would get a few shots, earn some money, and then depart for new adventures. Instead he’d woken up from surgery less than an hour ago, his body no longer entirely his own. He dimly remembered doctors trying to calm and sedate him before he panicked, broke free, and started to run. His fall had just been his latest gamble in escaping his pursuers.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/122319_Verces.jpg"><img style="max-width:100%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/122319_Verces.jpg"></a> 
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">Verces — illustration by Mark Molnar</p> 
                </div> 
                <p>The shirren eyed him sadly. “C’mon, you’re clearly not doing well. I’m just coming off duty and can put you up for a bit. Name’s Estrik.” She reached up and clasped his hand, pulling him up and out.</p> 
                <p>“Tahja Maur of Clan Estu, House Truyark, Essence of Ipu—and thank you,” he responded while twisting his leg free from where it had punched through the dumpster lid. “But I’m being chased by dangerous people.” With that, he extracted his left leg, a cybernetic limb of hex-plated skin covering powerful joints and pistons.</p> 
                <p>Estrik’s barbules quivered with admiration as she inspected the limb with interest. “No kidding! Dermasteel weave?” She flicked the knee. “Is that adamantine? I bet it’s the debt collectors after you, with this thing’s price tag. Weird that it doesn’t even have a maker’s mark, though.” The shirren’s antennae suddenly twitched and she straightened with fear before pushing Tahja behind cover and pathing a silent warning into his mind. “<i>We have company!</i>”</p> 
                <p>“That’s because it’s stolen,” remarked the alley wall as a hidden figure’s skin dropped its camouflaged pattern. Eight feet tall with bulging all-black eyes and pale, chameleon-like skin, he was a verthani, the planet’s native humanoid species. His mostly nude frame had allowed his chromatophores to hide his approach, but it did little to hide the artificial muscle fibers and untold other augmentations that bulged under his skin. “This is NextStep business. Move away from the subject, bug. This doesn’t concern you.”</p> 
                <p>“Rude!” Estrik wailed before telepathically gushing to Tahja <i>“You’re a criminal? Wanted by a real bounty hunter?”</i> Her eyes developed an admiring sheen. <i>“It’s just like in the stories—like Astral Eternities or Galaxy in your Eye? I’m such a fan! So. Cool.”</i> She paused in hearing his wordless response before adding <i>“Oh yeah, I know another way out of here, why?”</i> His response came in the form of a swift kick that sent the dumpster careening across the alley, powered by his leg’s mechanical strength. It slammed into the verthani and threw him against the nearby wall, stunning him.</p> 
                <p>“The escape?” Tahja insisted. Estrik goggled at the dumpster for a second before whipping out a keycard, running to the far end of the alley, and swiping open a service door. The two slipped inside before slamming it closed. “Where to from here?”</p> 
                <p>“Zakol, one of the camera operators,” Estrik wheezed through her flaring facial spiracles. “He has a bunch of family near Darkside. It’s a trek, but maybe they could get you out of here?” The shirren mentally conveyed a vague map interspersed with halfhearted assurances and excited squealing. The chatter ceased as the door shuddered from a gunshot outside and the blaze of a plasma torch punched through the lock. “New plan: we run.”</p> 
                <p>By the time the outside door clattered open, Tahja had already bounded down the service hall, up two flights of stairs, through a cluster of interns, and into a studio—all while Estrik apologetically struggled to keep up with the kasatha’s cybernetically enhanced strides. They caught their breath for a moment before Estrik telepathically buzzed, <i>“No, no, we can’t stay here.”</i> Tahja stared back blankly, prompting the shirren to continue. <i>“Hear that? They’re filming Galaxy in Your Eye, only the premier verthani serial romantic drama. You know, the star-crossed lovers forbidden to marry by caste, all set during the Gap? Thing’s practically a religion for some folks. Like, I’m not even allowed to clean within a floor of this place!”</i></p> 
                <p>“No other choice I see,” Tahja muttered, looking for a concealed means of crossing the occupied set being watched by a live studio audience. He tiptoed toward the ongoing scene featuring fantastically beautiful actors.</p> 
                <p>“Zfezar,” demanded the Augmented verthani woman, her steely arm and reinforced spine belying the melodramatic intensity in her voice as she wilted in her partners arms. “Were our families to find us so, what would they say?”</p> 
                <p>“To hell with families, traditions, and castes, Apsoria!” responded her masculine counterpart, his chest emblazoned with Ibra’s divine constellation, marking him as a God-Chosen. “Too long have we danced to their wishes yet denied the duet sung by our hearts alone! Here, just the two of us, nothing can stand in our way.”</p> 
                <p>The stage door shuddered, signaling the bounty hunter’s arrival. As Estrik worriedly looked back, Tahja pushed forward onto the set, wasting no more time. The actors, interrupted on the cusp of embrace looked up with shock, the director off-screen seemed ready to shout, and the hundred-strong audience gazed hungrily at this new development with an audible gasp. Tahja took to one knee, showing his cybernetics openly. “My lady, I come with dire news. Your family has learned of your actions.”</p> 
                <p>“Ha, they dare not intervene!” laughed Apsoria, improvising, though her narrowing eyes conveyed how suspicious she was of the kasatha’s sudden appearance.</p> 
                <p><i>“More dramatic!”</i> Estrik mentally insisted from her hiding spot.</p> 
                <p>“And...they have sent assassins, my lady!” Tahja added quickly. “By slaying your love, ah—“</p> 
                <p><i>“His Occult Eminence Zfezar”</i></p> 
                <p>“—his Occult Eminence Zfezar,” Tahja continued, silently thanking Estrik for the prompt, “you will be bound to honor your arranged marriage!”</p> 
                <p>The audience’s gratifying gasps mollified the director, who sat back to observe this strange turn, and the actors adapted flawlessly to the changing script. “Villains!” growled Zfezar with a flourish of his cape.</p> 
                <p>Just then, the stage door fell open, and the bounty hunter stepped into the lights, at first with menace but then with quizzical uncertainty. As Apsoria and Zfefar berated the supposed assassin, the bounty hunter struggled to push past them, shouting. “Brightside blind you all, stand aside!” His throat swelled as his head tilted back before he spewed a bolt of electricity from his biotech dragon gland. Tahja’s cybernetic leg kicked into action—literally—flinging him out of danger’s path.</p> 
                <p>The audience shrieked with delight as Zfezar attempted a stage punch that the bounty hunter easily dodged before hurling the actor aside. He was just beginning spit another attack when Apsoria struck in earnest, hitting him in the throat as his dragon gland built up charge. The hostile verthani’s eyes went wide as the gland fired prematurely, shocking him and sending coruscating lightning ringlets dancing over his body. Smoking slightly, he dropped to the ground.</p> 
                <p> Without hesitation, the two actors took each other in their arms. “My family has spoken its peace, and I have delivered my answer, Zfezar. No matter what lies ahead, we will face it...” </p> 
                <p>“...together,” he finished.</p> 
                <p>“And scene!” cried the director, punctuated by the audience’s applause. She hopped off her chair and snagged Tahja by an arm. “You know that there weren’t kasathas in this system during the Gap, right? And that makes what just happened more than a little anachronistic?”</p> 
                <p>“Um, yes? About that?” stuttered the young kasatha.</p> 
                <p>“Ha! Soesn’t matter! The show’s set in the Gap for a reason: can’t historically disprove anything we film! And now this is just what we need to shake up the story: aliens! I’ll get those damn writers to revise whatever sorry script they had in store. Let’s talk numbers—got an agent?”</p> 
                <p>Tahja desperately looked around for any help in salvaging this awkward moment, but he saw only Estrik. Her arms were quivering with excitement as she pathed emphatically to him one more time: <i>“So! Cool!”</i></p>

                <p>I’m pretty new to Society play, but I’m really excited to be coming in to the Organized Play department at this time. My primary focus is on Pathfinder Society, though we have lots of crossover between the various programs. We’ve recently been talking about our plans for the upcoming seasons, and I can’t wait to see what you all think. As something of a crash course in the department, I recently wrote a Pathfinder Society Quest, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq021xi/discuss?Pathfinder-Society-Quest-4-Port-Peril-Pub-Crawl">Port Peril Pub Crawl</a>, which might be up your alley if you like pirates and mayhem (I did in fact write it in a pub, though there weren’t any pirates or barfights, which is probably for the best).</p> 
                <p>When I’m not playing RPGs, I’m usually either blowing bubbles or writing about Japanese music. You can catch me on The Twitters at @toriariaria.</p>

                <p itemprop="description">As the year steadily gets closer to ending, the Organized Play Team has been hard at work preparing for next year’s content. While we’re still far away from announcing exactly everything that is on the horizon for Starfinder Year 3, the team wanted to take some time to discuss an important change coming up in the Starfinder setting. Specifically, the change in leadership of the Starfinder Society—a new First Seeker!</p> 
                <p>Back at the end of November, the Organized Play Team hopped onto the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/officialpaizo" target="_blank">Paizo Twitch Steam</a> to detail a whole bunch of new information. During <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXbSIeJ4A_s" target="_blank">this event</a>, we announced the winner of our <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sguj?Choosing-the-Future-Path">recently completed survey</a> to determine the Society’s new leader going into Year 3. While many heard the news live on air, we’re pleased to announce here, in the blog, that the Starfinder Society’s new First Seeker is Ehu Hadif Ko’ra Amares of Clan Tolar.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/092519_Eho.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/092519_Eho.jpg" alt="" width="50%/"></a> 
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">Ehu — Credit to Beatrice Pellagatti</p> 
                </div> 
                <p>Ehu, a male kasatha, came up in our initial selection process as something of the “quintessential Starfinder”. He’s about bringing the Society’s goal of exploration and research back to the forefront of the Starfinder Society’s agenda. Given the Starfinder Society’s escapades in the Scoured Stars and their more recent multimedia bouts in the Pact Worlds, it seems that Ehu is poised to bring the Starfinder Society back to basics in terms of individual missions and an overarching goal. His connection with the Kasathan deity known as Talavet also allows for the inclusion of some previously unexplored religious elements of Starfinder.</p> 
                <p>Organized Play Campaign participants can expect to see Ehu take the stage as First Seeker during the events of this summer’s interactive special, but until then, First Seeker Luwazi Elsebo still has some loose ends to deal with. As we make the transition into our new First Seeker, players should note that Luwazi’s Second Seekers faction will move into an inactive status.<br> <b>Important Note</b>: this isn’t traditional retirement, just that the factions likely won’t have major story roles in coming seasons (similar to the Jadnura faction) and we will not have new faction boon options. This does means that a new Second Seekers (Ehu Hadif) faction will launch with the new season, so be on the lookout for a new faction and a bunch of new related character options!</p> 
                <p>In increasing the living world feel of the Starfinder Society, we decided to start small and see how the experience went, which is why we limited the candidate pool to those characters achieving the Second Seeker Capstone Boon. Analyzing the process, including feedback on selection and voting, we are ready to expand how we handle living world options. In the future, expect Capstone Boon options involving inclusion in the campaign to open up for All Factions. Expect to see this (and several other quality of life changes) in the Year 3 Guide update, set to come out this summer!</p> 
                <p>Overall, the team is incredibly excited in the direction that Ehu Hadif is going to take the Starfinder Society into Year 3. I’m personally excited for the wide variety of scenarios that this new First Seeker is going to let us tell, and the ability to focus on some particular story arcs that fans have cited interest in since the early days of the Starfinder Society Organized Play Campaign. Trust me when I say, you’ll lose your minds—both literally (for your character) and figuratively (for you)—when you hear some of the stories we’re going to tell with Ehu Hadif leading the charge!</p> 
                <p>To a bright future,</p>

               <blockquote> 
                <p itemprop="description">It was a cold, still night in Arl, and from the thasteron-stained alleys of the Old Quarter to the shimmering stadiums of the Vitaritech Coliseum, the people cried out for blood. </p> 
                <p>Except for Vaereji.</p> 
                <p>The damaya lashunta stood among the screaming throng of the Crimson Forum, oldest arena on the desert planet of Akiton, and for a professional lounge singer, he was strangely silent. With his pale skin and long antennae slicked down against his dark blue hair, he ought to have stood out among the towering, four-armed shobhads and furtive, rat-like ysoki natives, a handsome figure in his tailored black tuxedo. But tonight, all eyes were fixed on the blood sport.</p> 
                <p>It might as well have been an execution. </p> 
                <p>The rabble watched, enraptured, as a reptilian vesk lifted his opponent—a grizzled, white-furred ysoki with a mechanical arm—into the air, ripped off the prosthetic appendage, and, with a mighty hiss, tossed the dying mammal onto the reddened ground.</p> 
                <p>Yells of violent delight erupted at the totality of the kill, but Vaereji’s gasp was one of horror…not merely because the ysoki was his friend—a friend he’d bet most of his credits on—but because the fight was supposed to be a sure thing.</p> 
                <p>The barrel of the arc pistol pressed against his back certainly didn’t help.</p> 
                <p>“Better come with me, snazzy,” growled a voice at his ear. “You’ve got <i>singing</i> to do.”</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/121819_Atikon.jpg"><img style="max-width:100%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/121819_Atikon500.jpg"></a> 
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">Akiton — illustration by Leon Tukker</p> 
                </div> 
                <p>They’d called him an adept back on Castrovel, and it was true, but Vaereji had only used his phrenic abilities to help with his music. To push his telepathic abilities beyond those of other lashuntas. To feel the emotional swell of the audience between songs, hear the anticipatory desires in their thoughts—even send them telepathic messages, if they lined up with his lyrics. His abilities helped him put on a better show, and that was all Vaereji really wanted to use them for.</p> 
                <p>It had been the ysoki’s idea to use them to cheat.</p> 
                <p>The grizzled little fighter—who went by “Rusty” in the arenas—was a regular at the Forum district clubs where Vaereji liked to perform. One night the two had wound up sharing a drink, and then another, and just like that, a friendship was born. Nothing more to it, until…</p> 
                <p>“Why do they stick up sometimes?” Rusty had asked, pointing a worn metal finger at the lashunta’s antennae.</p> 
                <p>Vaereji, then drunk, had embarrassedly slicked them back down and mumbled, “They do that sometimes, when I use my abilities.”</p> 
                <p>“Abilities?”</p> 
                <p>The lounge singer didn’t get halfway through his explanation before noticing a conspiratorial glint in Rusty’s eye, but he’d been too drunk to care. He even bragged a little, about how sometimes he could manage clairvoyance, or a true mind probe—not that he bothered with that stuff most of the time. He just wanted to put on a good show!</p> 
                <p>With a grin, Rusty assured him that he could indeed put on a good show and make a few credits on the side, if he wanted. With the right moves, he could even make enough to open up his own club! Maybe even get out of Arl—or off Akiton altogether—and set up shop somewhere <i>classy</i>.</p> 
                <p>“What do you have in mind?” Vaereji asked cautiously.</p> 
                <p>“Nothing dangerous…”</p> 
                <p>All he had to do was perform at clubs where Rusty’s opponents (or their managers) were drinking. Sing the right leading songs—combat anthems, usually—mixed with the right leading set banter—“who in here’s got a fight this week?”—and even the fighters’ surface thoughts and feelings were full of intel. Occasionally, the ysoki convinced him to probe someone deeper, or use a mix of song and telepathic messages to demoralize them. With the right tips and drunken secret thoughts from his opponents, veteran fighter Rusty was able to take on all comers. He started to climb the ranks, and Vaereji started to bet on him a little more freely. They picked a mark, planned the fight, and, without fail, Rusty emerged from the bout victorious.</p> 
                <p>Until tonight.</p> 
                <p>Their intel on the vesk hadn’t been enough, it seemed, and now Rusty was dead, leaving Vaereji friendless, in debt, with a pistol at his back. Did they expect him to pay out everything tonight?</p> 
                <p>His assailant—a hulking android in dark estex—urged him on. They moved past the clinking credit tables of the bookies, beyond the red-tiled smoking rooms filled with celebrating shobhad gamblers, their eyes wide from transdimensional pesh and the thrill of the fight.</p> 
                <p>After another few minutes, the hall ended in a reinforced security door; the door slid open, and the android shoved Vaereji inside.</p> 
                <p>It was a luxury box, with vidfeeds on every wall showing looped scenes from past and current bouts. Plush chairs and low tables sat around the chamber, while recessed yellow lights made a pleasant diversion from the rusty red of the rest of the Forum. There were several androids in the room, dressed in cheap suits or hoods like the one behind him, and all of them were armed with arc pistols and nasty blades.</p> 
                <p>Except, that is, for the woman behind the large wooden desk at the back of the room.</p> 
                <p>“Hello, Mr. Vaereji,” she said. Her tone was polite, but it made the singer’s breath catch nonetheless. She had more mechanics visible than most androids, the joints of her synthetic skin lined with soft red light. Her eyes glowed the same red, and when she smiled, they shimmered. “Sorry for your loss this evening.”</p> 
                <p>“Who…who are you?” Vaereji asked. He’d been expecting to be threatened by debt collectors, not a gang of well-armed androids. He was starting to think this wasn’t just about the credits he now owed the Forum. But if not that…</p> 
                <p>“I’m the person who decides who fights who,” she said. “And until very recently, I was very good at predicting the winners.”</p> 
                <p><i>Who fights who?</i> Vaereji stepped backward, eyes widening with realization.</p> 
                <p>“Stars above,” he cursed quietly. “You’re Kell-3.”</p> 
                <p>The android’s silence was confirmation enough.</p> 
                <p>“Kell-3. A crimelord working the Forum…I thought you were an urban legend.”</p> 
                <p>Kell-3 smiled, flashing more of that red glimmer.</p> 
                <p>“So did your friend, Rusty,” she said, and the lounge singer gulped.</p> 
                <p>“He <i>thought</i> the syndicates didn’t care about this arena. He <i>thought</i> that Kell-3, the most feared android on Akiton, didn’t bother with Arl anymore. He <i>thought</i> he knew this city better than one of its own legends.”</p> 
                <p>The secret gangster of the Crimson Forum was real, Vaereji had been ripping her off, and she <i>knew</i>.</p> 
                <p>“He thought wrong,” Kell-3 said. </p> 
                <p>She let the words hang in the air, until the lashunta choked out the inevitable question.</p> 
                <p>“Are you going to kill me?”</p> 
                <p>Even shaky with fear, the singer’s voice was melodious, soothing. His words hung in the air, and the room grew quiet for a moment, only the dim sounds of the final spectators above leaving the Crimson Forum in satisfaction. </p> 
                <p>Then, Kell-3’s smile returned.</p> 
                <p>“Of course not,” she said. “You misunderstand. I’m a <i>fan</i>.”</p> 
                <p>Vaereji was at loss for words as she stepped toward him.</p> 
                <p>“People have used their psychic abilities to fix arena matches before, of course,” the android said. “But they’re usually thinking too big—mindbreakers trying to sow doubt, powerful technomancers shorting out the implants of combatants they bet against, that sort of thing. They always got caught. But you…”</p> 
                <p>His antennae popped up again, their position beyond his ability to control, especially when under pressure. Only just now, as he resisted the nervous compulsion to smooth them back against his hair lest movement be mistaken as a threat by the room full of armed toughs, did he realize that Kell-3 was wearing a glittering green evening gown. Tight-fitting and studded with gems, it looked almost as absurd and out of place here as his tuxedo did.</p> 
                <p>“You have a very subtle approach, and I’d like to see more of it.”</p> 
                <p>Kell-3 stood, inches from him, eyes like the bright red sands of Akiton itself. He understood now why he wasn’t getting his legs broken by goons, why he wasn’t dead like Rusty. She wanted him to work for her. He had never wanted anything like this.</p> 
                <p>“I just wanted to put on a good show,” he choked out.</p> 
                <p>But it was clear enough that she’d get her way. The singer was hers now. Defeated, Vaereji met the android’s gaze, and she laughed, a high static titter.</p> 
                <p>“You heard that crowd—could you ask for a better audience? Poor Rusty was sure he’d win, thanks to you, and that confidence led to the best bout I’ve seen in months. If every match was that brutal—that dramatic—this would be the busiest arena on the planet. With your help, it will be.”</p> 
                <p>She ran her hand up Vaereji’s face, and he flinched, but her fingers only rose to press up against his antennae. He blinked as Kell-3 slicked them back with surprising gentleness. </p> 
                <p>“I just wanted to sing.” His voice was low, almost a whisper.</p> 
                <p>When she spoke, her voice, too, was soft—but full of the same violence as the screaming crowd. “And as long as you can learn to take requests, you still will. With all of Arl as your audience. This city sings for blood, Vaereji...”</p> 
                <p>Now, the arenas were empty and silent. From the thasteron-stained alleys of the Old Quarter to the shimmering stadiums of the Vitaritech Coliseum, the city was sated, but in a dark room beneath the bloodied sands of the Crimson Forum, Vaereji’s latest performance was just beginning.</p> 
                <p>“Isn’t it time you sang along?”</p>

                <p itemprop="description">Starfinder is now available on Amazon Alexa!</p> 
                <p>If you missed our <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh18?STARFINDER-TO-LAND-ON-AMAZON-ALEXA">earlier announcement</a>, we’re launching a unique voice-based experience of the Starfinder Roleplaying Game today on Amazon’s cloud-based voice service, Alexa. </p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/121619_AmazonStarfinder.jpg" alt="Amazon Alexa Starfinder Promo Image"></a>

                </div> 
                <p>To play, all you have to do is say, “Alexa, play Starfinder” on any Alexa-enabled device. That will take you to the free pilot episode, “Scoundrels in the Spike,” adapted from the <i>Starfinder Beginner Box</i> adventure of the same name.</p> 
                <p>If you don’t already have an Alexa-enabled device, Alexa can be downloaded and installed for free on a variety of devices like phones, tablets, or computers. Just make sure you have a strong data connection (wifi is probably best).</p> 
                <p>I don’t want to spoil the wonders of Absalom Station’s Spike brought to vivid life by professional voice actors, immersive soundscapes, and screeching space goblins, but I will say that Starfinder on Alexa is an experience unlike any other, and with Alexa as your Game Master, get ready for some out-of-this-world excitement!</p> 
                <p>But the adventure doesn’t end with “Scoundrels in the Spike.” We’ve got more Starfinder on Alexa premium content planned for early 2020, with an adaptation of “Incident at Absalom Station,” the first volume of the Dead Suns Adventure Path. We’ll be sure to keep you updated with details on that as we get closer to release. For more information go to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B082SZRSRJ/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Starfinder&amp;qid=1576520603&amp;s=digital-skills&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank"> Alexa Starfinder Skill page</a>.</p> 
                <p>The pilot episode is free and is available in English in the United States. It will expand to Canada, Australia, the UK, and India in mid-January. So give Starfinder on Alexa a try, and let us know what you think in the comments section below!</p>

               <p><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq022bi?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-213-Storm-of-the-End-Times"><b>Starfinder Society #2-13: Storm of the End Times</b></a>, a scenario for levels 1-4 from Starfinder Society veteran Nicholas Wasko, takes us to a place first mentioned in our <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9u7x?Starfinder-Society-Quest-Into-the-Unknown">initial quest pack</a>: the oceanic world of Wealdriad. Sent to observe a rare natural phenomenon, the PCs must balance their roles as ambassadors, scientists, and researchers as they set-up on Wealdriad’s mysterious basalt pillars. Of course, not everything goes according to plan, and the PCs must step-up to stop one of the visiting groups from ruining the entire viewing. Storm of the End Times is appropriate for low-level play, while also providing some interesting new lore on one of Starfinder’s most popular species! </p> 
               <p>Here’s just one of the NPCs that the PCs have the chance to meet during this scenario</p>

               <p>As our ongoing Year of a Thousand Bites metaplot ramps up, so does the need for higher level adventurers. <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq022bj?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-214-Data-Purge"><b>Starfinder Society #2-14: Data Purge</b></a>, by Cole Kronewitter, is our first scenario for levels 9-12 and brings together a group of PCs for one of the most audacious missions yet: breaking into the Lorespire Complex. I want to tell a whole bunch of stories about this adventure, but I think it’s best for players to experience this scenario for themselves. Luckily for everyone out there, Cole has done an amazing job of putting together a “reverse-heist” that involves a lot of different encounter types, some career capstone-level encounters, and even a bit of time to just sit back and snack on an apple or two. </p> 
               <p>Here’s a shot of an interesting NPC who the PCs may meet inside the Lorespire campus.</p>

               <p>That’s it for December’s preview. I hope everyone can spend some time over the holidays relaxing, spending time with family and loved ones, and (of course) getting in some games of Starfinder Society. Stay tuned for January’s preview, when we come back with a pair of scenarios that take us somewhere we’ve never explored and a return to a planet we haven’t been to since the early days of Season 1.</p> 
               <p>Join us for next week’s blog, when our newest developer James Case gives us his take on life, the universe, and being a part of the organized play team.</p>

               <p>The first of this month’s adventures is a repeatable adventure for levels 1-4. In <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq022bg?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-110-Tarnbreakers-Trail"><b>Pathfinder Society Scenario #1–10: Tarnbreaker’s Trail</b></a>, written by the author of <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01zsq?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-1004-Reavers-Roar">Reaver’s Roar</a>, Steven Hammond, the PCs are called to the unforgiving Lands of the Linnorm Kings to participate in a grueling race. Starting in the Ulfen city of Kalsgard and traveling to the heart of the Varki nation of Icemark, the Balgirdtrek celebrates the travels and trials of an ancient linnorm king named Balgird and now serves as an event celebrating the new age of cooperation between the Ulfen and Varki peoples. Unfortunately, not everyone is happy to see the Pathfinder Society represented in this race and the PCs will need to contend not only against the harsh environment but with sabotage from some of their less scrupulous competition. In the tradition of scenarios like <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9k95?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-7-22-Bid-for-Alabastrine">Bid for Alabastrine</a>, Tarnbreaker’s Trail is rife with opportunities for roleplay but light on combat. </p>

               </div> 
               <p>The second scenario of the month, written by yours truly, Michael Sayre, is <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq022bh?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-111-Flames-of-Rebellion"><b>Pathfinder Society Scenario #1–11: Flames of Rebellion</b></a>. Continuing this season’s metaplot, the PCs travel to the town of Sauerton in the Andoran countryside in search of clues that the Society’s leaders can use to unravel the secrets of the mysterious Open Door Pact. The PCs won’t be in the countryside for long though, as their mission leads them to the long-abandoned tower known as Diggen’s Rest. Well, as they soon discover, long-abandoned by someone at some point. </p>

               <p>For this month’s quest, we turn the blog over to organized play developer James Case</p> 
               <p>Last but not least (except kind of because it is shorter since it’s a quest), we have a holiday-themed adventure for the festive season in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq022bt?Pathfinder-Society-Quest-5-The-Dragon-Who-Stole-Evoking-Day"><b>Quest #5: The Dragon Who Stole Evoking Day</b></a>, written for levels 3–6 by Paizo developer Luis Loza. The desert city of Sothis is getting ready for Evoking Day, a sacred day full of feasting, dancing, brilliant magic and pyrotechnics in celebration of Nethys, the God of Magic. Unfortunately, this year it seems that one resident finally had enough of the constant explosions disturbing their sleep and stole the wands and fireworks needed for the festivities. The PCs must track down the culprit and get the holiday supplies back.</p>

               <p>To kill time during the stakeout, Shaeon composed psychic poetry for her beloved, Kiress. Not far away, vermilliath flowers whorled in scarlet murmurations above the city’s defensive walls, and sometimes, when the wind shifted, she heard the rush-water sound of fluttering blossoms. Enthralled by the shivers it gave her, Shaeon grafted it synesthetically to the sibilant where Kiress’s name appeared in the poem, along with petrichor scent of the promenade</p> 
               <p>By the time Mataras kissed the horizon, the sky blushing in reply, most of the basement shops fronting the curved street below had closed. Some laborers trudging home past the fortune teller’s place bore the telltale circular welts of animute infection, unaware a black-market cure beyond their finances waited behind the door with the great eye sigil. Shaeon felt a fleeting temptation to let them know, to watch them batter down that door. But, since they weren’t receiving anymore, she’d have to yell the news down to them with lungs and lips, with a tongue that always found speaking uncomfortable. Such things, made for air and food and water, felt clumsy and inadequate for real communion.</p> 
               <p>Whatever Oryniri did with his stakeout time, tucked into the shadows on the other side of the pedestrian bridge, he wasn't sharing. Taking this to mean he might be bored, Shaeon telepathically sent him the newest line of her poem.</p> 
               <p>He pathed back with a terse <i>nice</i>, and they spent the next few minutes in psionic silence.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/121119_TftDWalls.jpg"><img style="max-width:100%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/121119_TftDWalls.jpg"></a>

               </div> 
               <p>With twilight there arrived two yaruks, which reared into the sky to feast on the flying blossoms like whale through krill. </p> 
               <p>The first telepathic alarms were rippling across the populace when one of the mighty beasts came down hard with its forelegs to crack the surge wall, then clambered onto the crumbling fortification, horned head darting from new heights to chase a river of petals. </p> 
               <p>Guards raced from streets and minor walls to defend the surge line. The steeple-high creatures weren’t carnivorous and feasted on neither bone nor blood. But they got such a narcotic buzz from vermilliath petals that most adults of the species were thoroughly addicted. Enough that they’d cheerfully endure bullets and lasers to gorge on gardens of the stuff, careless of what they trampled under their massive hooves.</p> 
               <p><i>Think our thief will capitalize on this distraction?</i> Shaeon pathed.</p> 
               <p><i>Probably</i>, Ory answered.</p> 
               <p>They stayed put, stayed quiet.</p> 
               <p>As the yaruk on the wall charged bellowing through a phalanx of defenders, a young lashunta urchin scurried past the fortune teller's storefront. Though the Face wasn’t a telepath, she employed a few. Two days earlier, they’d marked this girl as one of her messengers.</p> 
               <p><i>Any second</i></p> 
               <p>Inside, the Face crouched to peer through the window of her shop, adjusted her mask (which today resembled an impressionistic insect), and then passed through her door, hunching so her head wouldn’t scrape the doorframe. From the middle of the street, she watched the wall battle for several seconds before a passing man bumped into her.</p> 
               <p>The bumper—a korasha lashunta, stocky and scarred—paid the scene on the wall little heed and instead hurried into a narrow cut-through that zagged up to Expatriate Highway.</p> 
               <p><i>Handoff</i>, Ory pathed.<i> I've got the tail</i>.</p>
               <p> </p>
               <p><i>On relay,</i> Shaeon answered, and darted across the crushed-shell blocks of the Gyre.</p> 
               <p>She was rounding the Gyre’s south bend when Oryniri’s mind blurted in alarm, then went silent.</p> 
               <p><i>Gods be still. No, dammit, no.</i></p>
               <p> </p>
               <p>Feet a blur, Shaeon took the broad slabs of the Thirty-Four Steps two at a time. She brushed past a stubbled, thimble-hat tourist gaping at the yaruk brawl and reached the spot where the cut-through, the Steps, and highway met at odd angles.</p>
               <p> </p>
               <p>Oryniri’s crumpled form lay in the cut-through, blood seeping into porous stone. A touch from her mind told her it was just fluids now, soul already departed.</p> 
               <p>On the other side of Expatriate Highway, a stocky shadow slipped into an opposing alley. Shaeon sprinted after him, arc pistol drawn. The shrouded alley bent among buildings like a branch seeking sunlight before opening into a cloistered courtyard.</p> 
               <p>There, a man waited, backdropped by—</p> 
               <p>—the glittering tower of a lashunta corporation, reflections of the fight on the wall playing out across its silvered surface. Each flash of laser and cannon flare limned the tower's angles and protrusions, giving an impression of—</p> 
               <p>Shaeon shook her head.</p> 
               <p>A gun pressed to her neck.</p> 
               <p>“On my wrist is a telepathic scanner,” said a voice by her ear. “If you so much as bleat telepathically, it’ll show, and I’ll remove your head at the neck."</p> 
               <p>Shaeon’s mind cleared. Someone had <i>diverted</i> her with that tower imagery. Nice job, too. She guessed whoever did it was lashunta, like herself. Lashuntas practiced diverting as children, squaring off like gunslingers. Fastest mind wins. Slowest comes to in the middle of the quad, pants around his ankles. She wasn’t used to being the slow one.</p> 
               <p>Across the courtyard, the korasha raised one hand, pacifying, the other hovering near a gun on his belt. “Come on, man. We don’t do this.”</p> 
               <p>“I do,” said the man behind her, voice human, accent from off-world—Akiton, maybe. The tourist from the Steps, she realized. “Already did her partner. Now drop the weapon.”</p> 
               <p>Shaeon dropped her pistol before realizing the human might have been talking to his partner.</p> 
               <p>“She was diverted,” the korasha said, his hand unmoving. “I could have escaped.”</p> 
               <p>“Yeah? And what was she gonna do when she recovered?”</p> 
               <p>“I’m fast.”</p> 
               <p>“You ain’t faster than thought. You’d be surrounded in no time. Come on, Romalo, you’re the telepath.” Romalo winced at the disclosure of his name. Shaeon realized her chances of survival just dropped. “What the hell were you thinking, going back to the fortune-teller?”</p> 
               <p>“One of the flies bit my cousin,” Romalo said, peacemaking hand extended, two fingers and thumb loosely curled. “I had to do something.”</p> 
               <p>“No you didn’t. You put all of us at risk, you monumental fool.”</p> 
               <p>Fair critique. An alien disease, animute was hard to diagnose. After the first symptom, a victim had maybe six hours to take labat before the affliction became permanent. All of which meant anyone responding quickly to an animute infection was probably in-the-know. After learning the Face obtained labat days before the heist, and guessing she must have supplied the team, Ory and Shaeon had monitored the Face in case the outbreak forced her customer back. Clearly the human was the sensible one—but also the one immune to the disease’s worst symptom, telepathic isolation.</p> 
               <p>“Someone’s gonna see us,” the human continued. “We need to kill her. Now.”</p> 
               <p>All of us, the human had said. Implying more than two operatives on the heist. How many in this alley?</p> 
               <p>Romalo’s hand caught her eye. Two fingers fully extended.</p> 
               <p>Shaeon had always been fast at diverting, but she’d never tried to beat a mechanical sensor before. She counted down with her left hand against her leg, <i>one two</i>—Romalo’s eyes twitched—<i>three</i>.</p> 
               <p>She hit the human with her psychic poem.</p> 
               <p>Romalo drew, fired, and the human slumped against her, tumbled to the ground, pushing Shaeon down with his dead weight. </p> 
               <p>Then Romalo tried to flee. But, as he reached the mouth of an alley, Shaeon pathed an image of her sighting his back with her recovered arc pistol.</p> 
               <p>He stopped.</p> 
               <p><i>My cousin needs me</i>, he begged.</p> 
               <p><i>Your fault</i>, she thought, getting to her feet. <i>You brought the usqui flies. Released them.</i></p> 
               <p>He slumped. <i>They were never supposed to spread, just disable the guards’ telepathic alarms.</i> </p> 
               <p><i>But they did spread.</i> In the smugglers’ defense, they’d sterilized the queen that they used to whip up the usqui swarm. But it died, and they apparently had no idea that some warrior usqui mutate in the absence of queen pheromones. Into queens. Now Qabarat had an invasive species and Shaeon had a case to close.</p> 
               <p><i>I know. But my cousin— </i></p> 
               <p>She shot him.</p> 
               <p>It was an arc. He’d recover. In a cell.</p> 
               <hr width="50%"> 
               <br> 
               <p>Quiet reigned in the villa, all its bustling servants gone. </p> 
               <p>Shaeon frowned at the unwonted stillness.</p> 
               <p>In the reading room, Kiress's parents faced each other, tear-streaked, locked in silent argument. Kiress was outside, staring at the courtyard wall, back to the door. </p> 
               <p><i>Everything o—?</i> Shaeon started, and then recoiled.</p> 
               <p>Where Kiress’s mind should have been, she’d found nothing. </p> 
               <p>As she drew close, Kiress looked up and the cause was revealed. Shaeon traced the telltale bumps on her neck.</p> 
               <p>“How long?” she asked.</p> 
               <p>“Five hours.”</p> 
               <p><i>“Five?”</i></p> 
               <p>“It’s okay,” Kiress answered. “He’ll be back soon.”</p> 
               <p>A shiver settled into Shaeon’s spine.</p> 
               <p>“Pardon?”</p> 
               <p>“You haven’t met him, but my cousin’s back on Castrovel now, and he’s gone to fetch a cure,” Kiress said, waving a hand at the wall. “Sit with me and wait.”</p> 
               <p>Mind numb, unable to speak, Shaeon sat.</p> 
               <p>“Any minute now,” Kiress continued. “You’ll see. He’s never let me down.”</p>

               <a href="/image/content/Blog/12519-starfinderalexa360_500.jpeg"><img src="/image/content/Blog/12519-starfinderalexa360_500.jpeg"></a>

              <blockquote> 
               <p itemprop="description">For months now, we at Paizo have been holding onto an incredible secret: Starfinder, the science-fantasy game that mixes dragons with robotics and magic missiles with high-tech hacking, is coming to Amazon Alexa!</p> 
               <p>Let me repeat that. This is not a drill.</p> 
               <p>On December 16, a voice-based version of the Starfinder Roleplaying Game will be available for free on Alexa devices through Amazon’s cloud-based voice service. We’re giving you a heads-up on this release so that you can track down any of the Alexa-supported devices and, if you want, play the moment the free episode drops!</p> 
               <p>At launch, just say "Alexa, play Starfinder!" on any Alexa-enabled device. You’ll beam straight into an adapted version of “Scoundrels in the Spike,” the adventure I wrote for the <i>Starfinder Beginner Box</i>. </p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="/image/content/Blog/12519-starfinderalexa.jpg" alt="Amazon Alexa Starfinder Promo Image"></a>
                <img style="max-width:100%" src="/image/content/Blog/12519-starfinderalexa.jpg"> 
               </div> 
               <p>The adaptation script was written by none other than James L. Sutter, former Starfinder Creative Director and an amazing author whose work really makes this voice experience shine. Incredible voice actors, sound effects, and music further make this game sing. Specifically, when Starfinder Creative Director Robert G. McCreary and I heard the rich soundscapes of Absalom Station and felt the tension of combat with space goblins, we were gleefully astonished. This project has brought Starfinder’s world to life just as we imagined, and for me it was a truly awe-inspiring experience. </p> 
               <p>The rules Alexa uses to run the adventure are similarly adapted from the Beginner Box. Starfinder fans will recognize the player character options as Iseph the iconic operative, Quig the iconic mechanic, and Navasi the iconic envoy. What’s more, Raia the iconic technomancer can serve as a best friend and sidekick in these adventures. Simply put, there’s a lot to recognize and love if you’re already a fan of Starfinder. If you’re new to the game or even to tabletop RPGs in general, this experience is a fantastic gateway to a lifetime of adventure and fun</p> 
               <p>Beyond the pilot episode, Paizo and Amazon have big plans to bring more paid episodes of the Starfinder voice game to Alexa. But we’ll save that reveal for another blog—and probably a press release or two. </p> 
               <p>Before I smoke-bomb away from this exciting announcement, I’d like to just gush for a moment about how much of a dream this project was, both as a creative and as a manager. As we’ve spun up this initiative, I’ve gotten to work with some fantastic folks at Amazon, whose excitement for this project has left me energized and astounded at the power of tabletop storytelling across all media.</p> 
               <p>I’ve also gotten to work extensively with Rob and Sutter on this project. It’s been like a wonderful reunion of sorts, bringing me back to the days of working with those guys on the Starfinder Core Rulebook—and it’s made me realize how much I miss working with Sutter, especially since we both have a tendency to shriek and cackle when we get excited in creative meetings. I miss making that beautiful music with you, James.</p> 
               <p>Nostalgia aside, the entire Starfinder Alexa project has involved great team members, and the Starfinder team as well as folks all across Paizo have done a great job giving us feedback on the in-development game and generally supporting us along the way. </p> 
               <p>Now, time for that smoke bomb! Check out “Scoundrels in the Spike” when it drops, and stay tuned for more Paizo-Amazon news soon to come!</p>

               <p itemprop="description">Seoni always felt to me like one of the most pitch-perfect PACG conversions. Her ability to sacrifice her other spells to make attacks feels like a perfect conversion of the 1E Advanced Player’s Guide Arcane Blast feat .

               <p>As always, I suggest checking out <a href="/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh11?Core-Design-Seoni">Keith Richmond’s related article</a>, which discusses how Seoni evolved in the Core Set.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/112919_CoreSetCharacterSeoni.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/112919_CoreSetCharacterSeoni_500.jpeg"></a> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/112919_CoreSetCharacterSeoni2.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/112919_CoreSetCharacterSeoni2_500.jpeg"></a> 
               </div> 
               <h3>Core Set Seoni</h3> 
               <p><b>Best Skill:</b> Charisma (d12)</p> 
               <p><b>Character Type: </b> Warrior, Arcane</p> 
               <p><b>Skills. </b> Seoni has three low-powered subskills—Arcane, Diplomacy, and Knowledge—all running from +1 to +2. This is pretty typical for a character with a d12 skill die, and Seoni’s d12 is one of the best in the game. Not only does she use it for combat, as the basis of her Arcane skill, but she also rolls her Charisma and Diplomacy starting at that d12! And if there’s something that’s second best to a great combat skill, it’s a great Charisma skill, for attracting allies, for talking some foes out of fighting, and even for closing locations; Seoni has it all.</p> 
               <p><i>Weaknesses.</i> Seoni is another character with a d4 Strength skill, which could be a deficit in combat, but like Lini, she pretty much never uses it. That’s because she can always discard (or recharge) a spell for her “arcane blast,” and if she’s out of cards… well then, she likely has very little to lose to a failed combat. The rest of Seoni’s skills are pretty average. It’s perhaps worth noting that her Knowledge skill is only d8+1, pretty poor for a listed skill, but only Ezren and Lem share Knowledge in the Core Set, so it’s still worthwhile.</p> 
               <p><b>Cards. </b> Unsurprisingly, Seoni has a lot of spells (5). Beyond that, she’s pretty balanced, with allies (4), blessings (3), and items (2). Her paucity of weapons (1) is irrelevant given her arcane blast, but her total lack of armor (0) is more likely to cause problems—and may drive Seoni to either hunt for armorlike items or adopt the Celestial Runecaster role.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/12519-CoreBlessingShelynsSong.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/12519-CoreBlessingShelynsSong.jpg" alt="Front face of the Varian character card showing skills for the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game."></a> 
               </div> 
               <p><i>Blessings.</i> Obviously, Seoni should look for Shelyn blessings, which help Charisma. Blessings that recharge are also good choices, since Seoni doesn’t have any natural healing.</p> 
               <p><i>Items.</i> The Gem of Mental Acuity is a great choice for Seoni with her mighty d12 Charisma. Defensive items like the Bracers of Protection or the Ring of Protection can help Seoni if she’s getting damaged too much, while rechargeable Arcane items (which are limited to Wands in the Core Set) will be great for Seoni if she selects the power feat that guarantees their recharges.</p> 
               <p><i>Spells.</i> Obviously, if Seoni can collect spells that do more damage than her arcane blast, she should; Fire Bolt is a fine, easy-to-acquire example (and more on how it stacks up momentarily). However, Seoni should fill most of her spell spaces with utility spells; that allows her to be much more versatile. If she needs to attack, she can turn a utility spell into an arcane blast, otherwise she can use it for its utility power. Clairvoyance, Enhance, Fly, Good Omen, Locate Object, Magic Eye, Sleep, and Soothing Word are all great examples; choose specific spells based on the needs and weaknesses of your party.</p> 
               <h3>The Power of the Arcane</h3> 
               <p>Seoni is one of the simpler Core Set characters to play. Have no doubt, her Arcane recharging power is powerful, but it’s also less subtle than some others.</p> 
               <p><b>Use Your Arcane Blast as Appropriate.</b> Seoni’s arcane blast power does d12+2 + 2d4 + the card’s level at the start of the game, which averages to 13.5 + card level. She can increase it to d12+2 + 2d6 + card level (or 15.5 + card level) only if she takes the Celestial Runecaster role. That means that its improvement over the course of a campaign is largely dependent upon Seoni getting higher level cards into her deck. Fortunately, that card-based improvement is better than you might think: a +3 halfway through a campaign is about the same as adding 1d6, and a +6 at the end of a campaign is almost as good as adding 2d6. So even if d12+8 + 2d6 doesn’t viscerally feel quite as good as d12+2 + 4d6, the two results are very similar (and of course Seoni will be adding even more bonuses as she increases her Charisma).</p> 
               <p>All of that suggests that Seoni will usually be able to use her arcane blast instead of a specific spell, which is why she can stock up on utilities. But always keep in mind that powerful Attack spells might be marginally better than arcane blast, which can be important when Seoni goes up against a villain or henchmen, or when she needs a bit more attack variety, which is why she should keep a few in her deck. Her starting Force Missile is a fine example of a card that’s exactly as effective as her arcane blast, but it has extra utility because it can be used to help other characters. The level 1 Fire Bolt does d12+2 + 2d6 (or 15.5), which is one point better than if it’s discarded for an arcane blast, which would do d12+2 + 2d4+1 (or 14.5); the differential gets even more notable after Seoni gets a role, when Fire Bolt hops up to d12+2 + 3d6 (or 18). And, those Attack spells from the deck just get better over time. Volcanic Storm is d12+2 + 3d6 (or 18) from the start, and it has a unique evade-on-fail ability, while Seoni would only do d12+2 + 2d4+3 (or 16.5) if she used that spell to power her arcane blast. So, there’s a difference, but it’s sufficiently small that Seoni should mostly be relying on her native Arcana.</p> 
               <p><b>Improve Your Arcane Blast as Your First Power Feat.</b> Being able to recharge spells instead of discard cards in order to use Seoni’s first power is clearly a huge plus. Discarding is a big disadvantage because it brings you closer to death, while recharging is a huge advantage because it cycles your deck. Any power that changes something bad into something good is clearly a must-have (and Seoni can still fall back to discarding in the unlikely event that she runs out of spells).</p> 
               <p><b>Take the High-Powered Spells (and Items).</b> Seoni’s second power is that she can automatically recharge Arcane spells (and Arcane items if she has the appropriate power feat—which is going to happen quickly, since she has only two pre-role powers, though both are quite good). This means that Seoni should push more than just about any other character to get high-level cards, provided that they’re Arcane spells and items. It’s worth expending blessings to do so, because she’s going to be able to use those spells to power her arcane blast or for their high-level effects, all with automatic recharges. That means that she can use them again and again, without ever losing them to the discard pile.</p> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/12519-CoreRoleSeoniCelestialRunecaster.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/12519-CoreRoleSeoniCelestialRunecaster.jpg" width="500px"></a> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/12519-CoreRoleSeoniDreamweaver.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/12519-CoreRoleSeoniDreamweaver.jpg" width="500px"></a>

             <h3>The Seoni Roles</h3> 
             <p>Seoni’s Celestial Runecaster role is the simpler option, keeping her high-level play comparable to her low-level origins. Her Dreamweaver role allows for more subtlety.</p> 
             <p><b>Celestial Runecaster.</b> Quite simply, this role makes Seoni better at combat. It can improve her arcane blast from +2d4 to +2d6, which is a 2-point average swing, putting her blast on par with a lot of Attack spells. And it also can give her 1 point of damage reduction against Acid and Cold (and with a single feat, Electricity and Fire). The ability to reroll dice at Sacred locations is yet another power that makes Seoni more dependable for those high-level combats. So, this role is great for Seoni not only if you want to keep her simple, but also if she needs to be one of your party’s heavy hitters. This role can also give Seoni the ability to move an extra time each turn—especially useful if Amiri is missing from your party.</p> 
             <p><b>Dreamweaver.</b> This is a more subtle role that focuses largely on recharging cards. Seoni can recharge cards at the start of her turn and after explorations (and can even help local players to do so). If you understand the power of recharging, allowing you to move quickly through Seoni’s deck to get her best cards back out, this is a very fun role. Once again, this role also has a power that can help fill gaps in your party: if you’re missing Harsk, Lini, and Sajan, you can pick up Perception, and if you’re missing Fumbus and Merisiel, you can earn minor improvements against barriers.</p>

              <p itemprop="description">Wednesday, December 4th, our friends at Owlcat Games began to unveil their newest classic isometric CRPG game <a href="https://wrath.owlcatgames.com/" target="_blank"><i>Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous</i></a>! Based on the adventure path of the same name, it will follow in the footsteps of <i>Pathfinder: Kingmaker</i>, the previous digital Pathfinder adaptation. The first key art image of the game has been released as a teaser of things to come for the title. </p>

              </div> 
              <p>While not a direct sequel to <i>Pathfinder: Kingmaker, Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous</i> will expand and elaborate on the core elements that made Owlcat’s previous installment so successful. New features include the mythic progression system, a new corner of the award-winning Age of Lost Omens setting to explore, and more classes and character customizations drawn from Pathfinder's extensive history. Owlcat will be releasing more details as development progresses so that fans can stay caught up on how the process evolves over time. </p> 
              <p>“We are tremendously excited to announce Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous today. With our new game, we are taking everything that made Kingmaker enjoyable and building on top of it. We laid a solid foundation and are going to push the boundaries of the CRPG genre with our next title,” said Oleg Shpilchevskiy, Head of Owlcat Games studio. “We especially want to thank the Kingmaker community for their support because we would not be making this game if it weren’t for them. When Wrath of the Righteous is ready, we cannot wait to see them answer the call again.” </p> 
              <p><i>Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous</i> will be based on the tabletop Wrath of the Righteous Adventure Path and include new characters, plots, and elements to entertain even players already familiar with the adventure. It will tell the story of a large-scale conflict between mortals and demons where players are invited to immerse themselves in a world under siege from demonic forces. As a vicious invasion threatens the world, the consequences of one’s decisions will forge a unique narrative of their personal battle between good and evil.</p> 
              <p>Kingmaker’s Creative Director Alexander Mishulin and Lead Writer Alexander Komzolov return to their respective roles, and Owlcat confirmed that Chris Avellone is back on board lending a hand and supporting the narrative team as he did with <i>Pathfinder: Kingmaker.</i></p> 
              <p>To stand against the demonic invasion, the player character and their companions will receive additional powers from the player’s chosen mythic path. These paths vary widely in nature and profoundly impact the storyline of the game, permanently changing the characters and the world around them. Players may choose the path of the immortal lich, wielding powerful spells and commanding an army of undead; the path of the trickster, causing mischief and finding fun even in the middle of the demon-filled abyss; the path of the angel, summoning celestial allies into battle and meting bolts of divine judgment upon foes; or something else entirely.</p> 
              <p>Some Pathfinder RPG character classes that didn’t make it into Kingmaker will make their CRPG debut in Wrath of the Righteous alongside the returning roster, including — but not limited to — the fan-favorite witch and oracle. More classes and character options will be revealed in the near future.</p> 
              <p>Boasting an improved visual style, <i>Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous</i> will offer a look and feel distinct from that of Pathfinder: Kingmaker. Set in locations including a demon-infested wasteland, besieged crusader cities, and the foul, twisted Abyss itself, the art will capture the epic fight of the world’s defenders as they struggle to hold the line against the corrupting force of otherworldly entities. </p>

              <p>After this, a few weeks of rest...well, at least a few weeks of no travel. We’ve got plenty of plans to implement and tasks to complete during December. To give our team some time to relax over the holidays, and to ensure our players have games to play, we are releasing our December scenarios on the 18th of the month. The blog previews are scheduled for December 11th, so join us next week to take a peek at what is coming up!.</p> 
              <p>Some of you may have seen some updates regarding pregenerated characters for <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01zt5?Community-Use-Package-PF2E-Iconics-Pregenerated-Characters">Pathfinder Society (2nd edition)</a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9ukw?Community-Use-Package-Starfinder-Society-Pregenerated-Characters">Starfinder Society</a> For Pathfinder, we’ve corrected some errors, changed weight/carrying capacity, and added third level versions of a limited number of pregens, so that new players can participate in the first Level 3-6 scenario that released the end of November. Starfinder Society has three new pregens for the new classes in the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq0206c?Starfinder-Character-Operations-Manual">Character Operations Manual</a>. All of these are Society legal for play. We hope you enjoy! </p> 
              <p>In <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh15">last Tuesday’s blog</a>, we announced PaizoCon 2020 Guests of Honor (yay Kate and Damien!) and opened ticket sales. In related news, the Organized Play Foundation’s general call for volunteers to GM or help with HQ opens on Thursday, December 5th at 0800 am. More information is available on the <a href="http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/paizo/" target="_blank">OPF website.</a> </p> 
              <h2>Campaign Coins</h2> 
              <p>We awarded no coins during the past month.</p> 
              <h2>Stars</h2> 
              <p>One GM reached their 5th star in December. We still have a few weeks in 2019 for those trying to earn their 5th star before the year’s end. Doing so indicates a commitment to organized play, as to achieve this milestone, GMs must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios, as well as run a game for a venture-captain. A conservative estimate of time needed to reach 5-stars is 650 hours!</p> 
              <p>Congratulations to <b>Willis Sloat</b> on achieving his 5th star!</p> 
              <h2>Novas &amp; Glyphs</h2> 
              <p>We’ve received a few evaluations, so hopefully we will see a few 5-nova GMs soon! While we wait for the online nova evaluation tool, which is part of a greater tools overhaul, we’ve made an online form for logging evaluation games. Venture-Captains, please use <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfQH9FbQtZ1afA5-IqgDG4v-QD262rk_oqKjv9eSsJZnGIGaw/viewform" target="_blank">this form</a> to submit evaluations.</p> 
              <p>Quite a few of our community earned their first glyph this month! Congrats to everyone running events and qualifying for their glyphs. Huzzah and thank you. </p> 
              <h2>Convention Listing</h2> 
              <p>While only a few conventions remain in the 2019 convention season, we’ve already got a few listed for 2020, and the list grows daily! You can play in Society games at any of the conventions listed below! The list includes all submissions as of 1 October. If you see one missing, ping the organizer and have them submit a request for support or have them email me at <a href="mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com">organizedplay@paizo.com</a> to discuss their event. All of the conventions on the list maintain some type of web presence, be it website, social media page, or Warhorn listing, so if you are interested in attending in either capacity, check out their websites or contact the local venture-officer for more information!</p>

              <p>Aballon, the so-called Forge of this system and where I now stand, is something I’d never experienced in my long-life: a world inhabited by self-upgrading machines. Not confined to one form, these machines—anacites as they collectively refer to themselves—have spread across the small world closest to the Pact Worlds’ sun, gradually converting the world into something wondrous. Yet, even for a species who could so easily disconnect themselves from organic concerns, they’ve built their great cities to accommodate those around them.</p>

There are towering structures and a wide variety of robots, from huge to tiny, flying or walking around. The sky overhead is just space and stars (no atmosphere). The city is very clean and orderly, but in a way that caters specifically to robots."></a>

              </div> 
              <p>I came here to study the Pact Worlds, to walk its many worlds and meet its many people in hopes of learning their cultures. One of my siblings had spent much of their time in this place and had come to respect the Pact Worlds’ people. Another sibling, now deceased, had sought to one day venture to this star system, although their intentions were far less academic than my own. As for my final sibling, I couldn’t be sure if they even know this place exists.</p> 
              <p>An elevated vidcast monitor several hundred feet wide displays a white-furred rat woman snacking on an apple while partaking in an interview. Vendors of all backgrounds shout out to passersby about the quality of their wares, each making shop in alcoves at the base of massive structures, their presence something clearly intended by this place’s inscrutable designers. Even the walkways that I find myself on are designed to facilitate both organic and robotic beings alike. Hidden lines, invisible to those without augmented sight, direct the settlement’s robotic inhabitants in their maneuvering. Meanwhile, the unaugmented organic lifeforms disrupt the transit with chaotic movements that routinely cause minor fluctuations in the otherwise perfect transit lanes. A controlled chaos of sorts.</p> 
              <p>Taking this all in over the course of a few seconds, I compile my first impressions on this world. </p> 
              <p>Something pushes against me; the slightest force against my leg.</p> 
              <p>“Greetings visitor,” a synthetic voice speaks in the Pact Worlds’ common tongue, emitted from a blocky, rectangular robotic lifeform less than half my height. Its vocal tone is clearly intended to mask any type of association with other species, yet it is fashioned to be appealing to all listeners. “Apologies for this unit’s unintended interaction. This unit had not properly processed your presence in this area, possibly due to a scanning malfunction.”</p> 
              <p>I smile because that’s what others would expect of me. “No apology is necessary. It was my mistake not to properly respect this world’s traffic laws. Though, if I may make another imposition, may I ask you a question?”</p> 
              <p>The small anacite rolls back on its tiny automated wheels before adjusting the position of a small telescopic appendage to view my full body, scanning me to resolve its prior error. “This unit does not serve a critical function. This unit will respond as best it is able.”</p> 
              <p>“You’re a mechanical being, as are most on this world. Why are most the vast settlements of this planet designed with the lives of organics in mind?” I ask the question as I’ve yet to truly discern the answer—a rare occurrence for me.</p> 
              <p>“This unit understands your query. Answer: Aballon and its many megaplex settlements, such as this megaplex of Endeavor, were designed in respect for Those Who Wait.”</p> 
              <p>“Those who wait?”</p> 
              <p>A mechanical whirr of sound comes from the blocky anacite’s telescope as it adjusts a viewing setting. The other robotic beings around us change their ordered line to curve around the conversation. Far above, I see the ysoki woman on the vidscreen take another contented bite from her apple. The small anacite in front of me makes a final calibration before recalling its telescope into its interior, having completed its scan.</p> 
              <p>“Some anacite units designate themselves as Those Who Wait. Such anacite units conclude that our creators, the First Ones, will one day return to Aballon and as a result our world must be made amenable to them.” The small unit continues its response as a new line of anacites forms a second queue around us, curving in the opposite direction of the existing stream. “Other anacite units designate themselves as Those Who Become. Such anacite units conclude that they must take on the role of the First Ones and seed the galaxy with new anacite lifeforms.”</p> 
              <p>I maintain my smile and nod my head in appreciation of the explanation. The vidcast screen in the background has shifted to an advertisement led by a skeletal figure that is more of an assault on visual senses than anything near as succinct as my recent exchange.</p> 
              <p>“What of you, do you belong to Those Who Wait or Those Who Become?”</p> 
              <p>“This unit does not possess sufficient importance to hold such a belief. This unit exists to assist in the stability of Endeavor’s traffic flow, a task in which this unit is currently failing.”</p> 
              <p>I look down at the small anacite, taking in all of its simple boxy form and the elegance in its design save for the aesthetic displeasure most other beings would see in it. As the small anacite’s vocal emitters finish its statement, I can’t help but feel my siblings mocking me from the past. I stifle my annoyance by suppressing my smile.</p> 
              <p>“That seems a shame. Perhaps I can offer a more important existence? Would you be willing to act as my guide on this planet? I have credits.” I offer my hand down to the anacite.</p> 
              <p>“Acceptable. Assisting newcomers is of higher importance than my current designation.” An aperture opens on the anacite’s frame, releasing a metallic rod that ends near my hand. I clasp the appendage.</p> 
              <p>Together with my new guide, I step through the break in the curving line of anacites. The remaining robots adjust their movements to form two perfect lines of traffic. Perfection without words.</p>

              <p>From May 22-25th, 2020, at the SeaTac Doubletree by Hilton, Paizo will host hundreds of panels, workshops, and of course, games for our Paizo community. Our goal for PaizoCon is to provide a laid-back and relaxed convention experience where fans can meet up and enjoy a weekend of gaming and related activities with each other as well as our employees. A number of our business partners, Pathfinder or Starfinder compatible publishers, artists, authors, and other folks from our gaming community also attend, providing a unique opportunity to meet the minds that make and support the games we publish.</p> 
              <p>Saturday May 23rd, 2020, we will have our PaizoCon Preview Banquet where we will show off the exciting, and sometimes unannounced, new books and content we’re cooking up!</p> 
              <p>For PaizoCon 2020, we are thrilled to be joined by Guests of Honor Kate Baker and Damien Mammoliti!</p>

The question every week is simple: Can these five overcome their own differences long enough to succeed in this War for the Crown?”</i>
