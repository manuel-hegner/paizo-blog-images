  articlebody\"> \n    <p>Hi! I'm André Nguyen, Art and UI Lead on Pathfinder Adventures.\
  \ Our User Interface (\"UI\") has had quite a trip since we started. Let's take\
  \ a trip down Memory Lane...</p> \n    <h2>Simple Beginnings</h2> \n    <p itemprop=\"\
  description\">As development on Obsidian's <em>South Park: The Stick of Truth</em>\
  \ was winding down, and before Obsidian and Paizo greenlit <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2cuxMxD\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\"><em>Pathfinder Adventures</em></a>, I was asked to mock up what\
  \ a digital version of the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame\">Pathfinder\
  \ Adventure Card Game</a> might look like and how it would play. I based it on how\
  \ I played the physical card game, and how others (including Game Director Nathan\
  \ Davis) played. I even checked photos and videos of other people playing. I created\
  \ a playable Flash mockup for the owners here at Obsidian to show the game in action.\
  \ Below you'll see some screen grabs of that mockup.</p> \n    <p>From the start\
  \ of making a digital version, we wanted the locations and Sandpoint to feel like\
  \ they had a place, so the map was a key part of the design. (Don't be alarmed by\
  \ the giant hand—it was just simulating a hand using a touch screen because we had\
  \ swipes and taps, and it would follow the mouse cursor in the demo.)</p> \n   \
  \ <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20161004-Image1.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20161004-Image1_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>In the mockup, we had the locations show up as cards,\
  \ just like the physical game. You could swipe left and right to go through them\
  \ one by one. (This feature made it into early versions of the game before getting\
  \ cut... but we're getting ahead of ourselves.) In the mockup, we had the player\
  \ tapping a location card to enter that location.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20161004-Image2.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20161004-Image2_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Another thing we wanted from the start was to feel like\
  \ you were gathering dice. You know that feeling in the physical game, when you\
  \ gather the dice before you and think, \"Is this good enough, or should I add a\
  \ blessing, or get some help... ?\" Well, we wanted you to have that feeling in\
  \ the digital game. Every card you play that adds dice would add them on screen.\
  \ When you're happy, you swipe over them to roll!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20161004-Image3.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20161004-Image3_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <h2>The Blue Period</h2> \n    <p>Not only was the roll\
  \ a success, but the mockup video was approved and we got the go-ahead to make the\
  \ game. Or at least, we got the go-ahead for Nathan, myself, and one programmer—\
  Kevin Smith—to make a prototype. Our prototype had a title screen and simple character\
  \ selection, then jumped right into the game, with no real scenario selection—just\
  \ straight into Brigandoom! It's clear I was working the design of the card back\
  \ into the UI. We'll call this <em>Pathfinder Adventures</em>' \"blue period.\"\
  \ (Note that most of the screenshots we have were taken as bug reports, so they\
  \ have 1 or more... er, \"oddities\" in them.)</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20161004-Image4.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20161004-Image4_360.jpeg\"\

  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20161004-Image5_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <h2>Redder Pastures</h2> \n    <p>You can see that we got\
  \ rid of the location card carousel from the mockup and went with a fixed box on\
  \ the left. Even in this early UI, most elements had found their home. A few months\
  \ passed, and we had finished the prototype. We got the go-ahead to hire an artist\
  \ because my painting skills are just TOO GOOD. Lindsey Laney joined the team, and\
  \ we decided to go with a look a little like the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game\
  \ logo: The reds, the tans, the filigree!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n\
  \     <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20161004-Image6.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20161004-Image6_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>If you're unfamiliar, \"filigree\" is that fancy ornamental\
  \ stuff around the UI edges. It breaks up the frame a lot and since the logo has\
  \ that, it fits Pathfinder. The look of our game was inspired by the art Wayne Reynolds\
  \ did for Pathfinder: his color, textures, and numerous buckles. Through a few more\
  \ updates, we refined the UI a lot. It necessarily became more complex because the\
  \ card game allows so many things.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a\
  \ href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20161004-Image8.jpg\"><img\
  \ src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20161004-Image8_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <h2>Examining the Process</h2> \n    <p>Now let's take a\
  \ brief detour into process. I mock up most UI designs first, then discuss them\
  \ with the designers. I try to go over all the criteria for that design and offer\
  \ a few variants. In this case, I was designing what we call the \"Examine Tray\"\
  \ and I wanted to make it clear which cards were on the top or bottom of the location\
  \ deck.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20161004-Image7a.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20161004-Image7a_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a> <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20161004-Image7b.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20161004-Image7b_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br>\n     <br> <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20161004-Image7c.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20161004-Image7c_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>I then give it to an artist (I say that as if we ever\
  \ had more than 1 or 2 artists) who makes it pretty.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20161004-Image7d.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20161004-Image7d_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <h2>Getting Long in the Tooth</h2> \n    <p>And finally,\
  \ the game reached its current state. I think the game is slightly more complex\
  \ than originally thought. Hey, is that a dragon?</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20161004-Image9.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20161004-Image9_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> <i>It IS a dragon: Longtooth!</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>So that's\
  \ it for the evolution of the <i>tablet</i> UI. For phones, we had to make some\
  \ changes for usability and to receive approval from Apple and Google. Phones screens\
  \ range in size from tiny to almost tablet-sized. We took a few things off the screen\
  \ to declutter, and to make things more usable (buttons) and legible (text). For\
  \ personal preference, we're also adding in a toggle letting you choose which UI\
  \ to use. To demonstrate, here's Lem on a phone with a bunch of fancy dice!</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/20161004-Image10.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/20161004-Image10_360.jpeg\"></a>\n    </div>\
  \ \n    <p>So that's where we are. What's next? <em>Fortress of the Stone Giants</em>\
  \ is out now for iOS and Android tablets and phones! If you want a taste of what\
