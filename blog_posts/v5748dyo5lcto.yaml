  \ <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, November 8, 2011</p> \n   <p>With the release of the\
  \ <a href=\"/beginnerbox\"><i>Pathfinder RPG Beginner Box</i></a>, there are bound\
  \ to be some new folks here on the blog. One of the questions we get from time to\
  \ time concerning the line of RPG products is: Where do I start and what is required\
  \ for me to play? So, I thought I would take this blog to go over the existing core\
  \ RPG products, telling you what you need to upgrade to the full game and what you\
  \ can expect to find in each of the hardcover books.</p> \n   <h2>Core Rulebook</h2>\
  \ \n   <div class=\"blurb180\">\n    <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj\"><img\
  \ src=\"/image/product/catalog/PZO/PZO1110_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n   </div>\
  \ \n   <p>It goes without saying that if you are looking to upgrade to the full\
  \ version of the game, the first book on your radar should be the <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj\"\
  ><i>Core Rulebook</i></a>. This mighty 576-page tome contains all the rules for\
  \ both players and Game Masters to get started. It includes 7 races, 11 classes,\
  \ over 500 spells, and a mountain of magic items. If you are coming from the <i>Beginner\
  \ Box</i>, there is much here that you will recognize, but there is a lot of new\
  \ content for you to explore as well. The classes go all the way up to 20th level\
  \ and you have a lot more control when customizing a character. When making the\
  \ change, be sure to do it incrementally. Much of the content in this book can be\
  \ added piecemeal so you don’t have to overwhelm new players. Of all the books in\
  \ the RPG line, this one is the most important. If you are coming from the <i>Beginner\
  \ Box</i> and want more information on what you can expect to find in here, check\
  \ out the free <a href=\"/store/byCompany/p/paizoPublishingLLC/pathfinder/pathfinderRPG/products/beginnerbox/v5748btpy8p2k\"\
  >Beginner Box Player Pack</a>.</p> \n   <h2>Bestiary</h2> \n   <p>The only thing\
  \ the <i>Core Rulebook</i> does not contain is new monsters. For that we have the\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8auu\"><i>Bestiary</i></a>. This 320-page book\
  \ contains over 300 monsters, ranging from the lowly kobold to the incredibly deadly\
  \ ancient dragons, with plenty of monsters to challenge a group of any level. If\
  \ you are the GM, you will need this book. As a bonus, with a bit of work, many\
  \ of the monsters in this book could work with a <i>Beginner Box</i> campaign. If\
  \ you need even more monsters, we’ve got you covered there too. Check out <a href=\"\
  /pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8hif\"><i>Bestiary 2</i></a>, and next month, we are releasing\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8odu\"><i>Bestiary 3</i></a>. Each one of these\
  \ beastly books contains over 300 new monsters to add to your game.</p> \n   <h2>GM\
  \ Screen</h2> \n   <p>The Game Master keeps lots of secrets from his players, at\
  \ least until they uncover them. To help keep notes and certain die rolls private,\
  \ you can pick up the <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8bc7\"><i>GM Screen</i></a>.\
  \ With some great art on the player side, this screen is packed with handy reference\
  \ tables on the GM side to prevent you from having to flip through the <i>Core Rulebook</i>\
  \ quite as often. While its not vital to the gaming experience, having a good GM\
  \ Screen can speed up the game and keep the players in the dark about the GMs evil\
  \ plans.</p> \n   <h2>GameMastery Guide</h2> \n   <p>Being the Game Master can be\
  \ tricky. There are lots of details to juggle and the players have a tendency to\
  \ mess up even the best-laid plots and plans. The <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8ffn\"\
  ><i>GameMastery Guide</i></a> gives the GM a host of tips, tricks, and tools to\
  \ make life behind the screen easy. It includes a wealth of information to aid in\
  \ running the game, a mountain of sample NPCs, and additional rules to handle tricky\
  \ situations, like a chase through a crowded city street. If you’re new to the job\
  \ of being a GM, this book contains a lot of information to help you run a successful\
  \ and exciting game.</p> \n   <h2>Advanced Player’s Guide</h2> \n   <p>Once you’\
  ve had a chance to play and experiment with all the <i>Core Rulebook</i> has to\
  \ offer, its time to move on to the <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1\"><i>Advanced\
  \ Player’s Guide</i></a>. This book contains six new classes to play with, including\
  \ the alchemist, inquisitor, and witch, as well as a ton of new options for all\
  \ of the classes from the Core Rulebook. There are new feats, spells, and equipment\
  \ for both players and GMs alike. While it’s called “Advanced,” most of the rules\
  \ in this book are no more complicated than those in the <i>Core Rulebook</i>; there\
  \ are just more to choose from.</p> \n   <h2>Ultimate Magic and Ultimate Combat</h2>\
  \ \n   <p>Following up the <i>Advanced Player’s Guide</i> is a pair of books that\
  \ explore two of the most important concepts in the game: Magic and Combat. In <a\
  \ href=\"/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8k8r\"><i>Ultimate Magic</i></a>, you get all sorts\
  \ of rules, tips, and advice for using magic in your game, as both a player and\
  \ a GM. There is a new class (the magus), as well as a bunch of feats and spells\
  \ related to magic and spellcasting. There are also rules for magical constructs,\
  \ spellbooks, and different types of magic. In <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8mcz\"\
  ><i>Ultimate Combat</i></a>, we look at the fine art of using sharp pieces of metal\
  \ to slay monsters. The book includes rules for black powder firearms and a new\
  \ class, the gunslinger, as well as a bunch of new options for every character that\
  \ wields a weapon or a fist. Like the <i>Advanced Player’s Guide</i>, these books\
  \ supplement the <i>Core Rulebook</i>, and while not required to play, they add\
  \ a number of new, exciting options.</p> \n   <h2>So, What Do I Need to Get Started?</h2>\
  \ \n   <p>Well, if you are new to the game, you probably want to start with the\
  \ <i>Beginner Box</i>, but after that, you might want to check out the <i>Core Rulebook</i>.\
  \ You can even pick up a PDF of the rules for just $10 to get started. After that,\
  \ it really depends. If you’re the GM, then you should probably grab the <i>Bestiary</i>\
  \ too (also available as an inexpensive PDF). The <i>Core Rulebook</i> will keep\
  \ you busy for a while, but when you are ready to add more to your game, check out\
  \ some of the other books mentioned above. A world of adventure awaits.</p> \n \
