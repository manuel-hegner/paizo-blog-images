  \ that organization plays a major role in the season's plotline, Linda and I are\
  \ also revisiting some older stories, continuing more recent narrative threads,\
  \ and exploring places that the campaign has never seen. We'd like to pull back\
  \ the curtain a bit on how we came up with the outlines for the August scenarios.\
  \ As you might guess there are some MINOR SPOILERS ahead—more to help you choose\
  \ which character to play, and less to ruin the story.</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  \ Scenario #7-04: The Ironbound Schism</a></h2> \n     <p>It's been years since\
  \ we've had a good rumble with giants, and I wanted to give a tip of the hat to\
  \ the recently concluded <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/giantslayer\">Giantslayer\
  \ Adventure Path</a>. Also, there have been some great options appearing in books\
  \ like the <a href=\"/products/btpy99s4\"><em>Giant Hunter's Handbook</em></a>,\
  \ and I like knowing that there are some fun adventures out there that give specialized\
  \ characters a chance to shine.</p> \n     <p>Things really started to come together\
  \ when I spoke with Rob McCreary—senior developer and lead developer for Giantslayer—\
  and confirmed that the Adventure Path had not traveled to Averaka. I love Averaka.\
  \ In part it's because I like the idea of a town eking out a living while clashing\
  \ with giants. Even more than that, I really like having a proud settlement comprised\
  \ almost entirely of half-orcs who are working to define themselves not as what\
  \ they are not (i.e. full humans or full orcs) but what they are: a distinct people\
  \ worthy of respect and free to live their lives without fear of persecution. Add\
  \ to that its location in an old Thassilonian kingdom, and we couldn't resist. We\
  \ put a pin in the isle of Flintyreach and started writing.</p> \n     <p>Of course,\
  \ this isn't just any slugfest with giants. While Linda and I wrote it, we added\
  \ in some twists that should keep the combats interesting and the players guessing.\
  \ Break out your titan-felling champions, your scholars of Thassilonian lore, and\
  \ your loyal members of the Scarab Sages faction (they have a fun metaplot opportunity\
  \ here), and set sail for Averaka!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb120\">\n      <a\

  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <h2><a href=\"/products/btpy9g82\">Pathfinder Society\
  \ Scenario #7-05: School of Spirits</a></h2> \n     <p>Whether on the forums or\
  \ at conventions, I get a lot of questions about when we'll revisit some beloved\
  \ loose thread that has been dangling for years. It can be a lot of fun to realize\
  \ that a past author or developer left room for a sequel, and it's all the better\
  \ when scores of players cite the original as one of their favorite adventures.\
  \ At long last the timeline and stars aligned, and we devised a follow-up to a choice\
  \ Season 0 scenario: <a href=\"/products/btpy8531\"><em>Black Waters</em></a>.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>We're heading back into the Absalom's decrepit Precipice Quarter, once\
  \ the elite neighborhood of Beldrin's Bluff and now a run-down eyesore inhabited\
  \ by cutpurses and ghost stories. A former resident who barely survived the earthquake\
  \ years ago has returned to sift through the wreckage for some key to her past,\
  \ and who better to help her than a team of Pathfinders?</p> \n     <p>I was very\
  \ particular when considering the author for this adventure, both because it involves\
  \ some deep character development and because it follows in the footsteps of such\
  \ a popular scenario from the earliest days of the campaign. I was very pleased\
  \ to have Alex Greenshields (author of <a href=\"/products/btpy8xkg\"><em>#5-02:\
  \ The Wardstone Patrol</em></a>, which features several very powerful NPC scenes),\
  \ and he did a great job of illustrating how a central NPC has weathered the intervening\
  \ years.</p> \n     <p>I strongly recommend playing this after <em>Black Waters</em>.\
  \ This is also a great adventure for members of the Liberty's Edge faction, who\
  \ have a strong metaplot opportunity. We can't wait to hear what you think of it.</p>\
