  >Since a bit before all of us at Paizo transitioned into work-from-home mode back\
  \ in early March, my primary job has been all things <em>Kingmaker</em>. The upcoming\
  \ 2nd-edition update is one of the largest single print projects we’ve ever attempted\
  \ at Paizo, with about a thousand pages represented between the 640 page Adventure\
  \ Path (compare that to, say, the 432 pages in the <em>Rise of the Runelords</em>\
  \ hardcover compilation), the 128 page Companion Guide (which brings in all 12 companions\
  \ from Owlcat’s computer game version of <em>Kingmaker</em>), and a pair of Bestiary\
  \ companions to help folks run the Adventure Path using 1st edition Pathfinder rules\
  \ or even 5E rules. And this doesn’t even touch the various accessory products—\
  maps and screens and more!</p> \n       <p>Unfortunately, the magnitude of getting\
  \ this all done means that we’re not going to have it out for folks anytime soon.\
  \ At this point, we’re targeting a release sometime in the second half of 2021—\
  we’ll keep everyone updated as we get closer to the finish line, of course, but\
  \ until then, work proceeds apace, with it being pretty much the only thing (other\
  \ than meetings and product approvals) that I’m focused on right now.</p> \n   \
  \    <p>As soon as I’m done writing this blog post, I’m jumping right back in to\
  \ development—I’m midway through Chapter 7: Blood for Blood, working my way through\
  \ Fort Drelev. I’ve finished development on the Kingdom management rules, the Settlement\
  \ building rules, and the narrative Mass Combat rules. We’ve got over 300 pages\
  \ of content in edit as I race to stay ahead of that curve.</p> \n       <p>But\
  \ there’s more than words in an adventure, and now we come to the exciting part\
  \ of this blog post! We’re ordering a mountain of new art for this project, both\
  \ to illustrate scenes and characters and creatures we didn’t have the budget or\
  \ time or pages to do in the first printing of Kingmaker a decade ago, along with\
  \ lots of art for brand new content that’s never before seen print.</p> \n     \
  \  <p>Some of that art’s already coming in, in fact, as you’ve no doubt already\
  \ noticed! </p> \n       <p>First, we’ve got an image from the new introduction\
  \ to the Adventure Path, based on the prologue from Owlcat’s version of the game\
  \ when the brand-new PCs gather at Lady Jamandi Aldori’s estate for a feast and\
  \ to be assigned their charters for exploring the Stolen Lands. Of course, even\
  \ at first level, Amiri’s not gonna take any guff from midnight killers trying to\
  \ ambush her while she’s resting up from a night of feasting! </p>\n       <div\

  \ of Lady Jamandi, we’ve got a brand new illustration of her—she’s essentially your\
  \ patron for the first part of this entire campaign, and her role throughout the\
  \ Adventure Path is a bit more involved... unless, of course, the players at your\
  \ table decide to cut ties with Rostland and go off on their own to build a kingdom.\
  \ It is a sandbox campaign still, after all!</p> \n       <p>Being able to finally\
  \ illustrate a certain enormous and angry owlbear in his own illustration had to\
  \ happen, obviously.</p> \n       <p>And finally, have a mutant chimera that may\
  \ have gotten a bit too close to a volatile mix of planar energies from the First\
  \ World and the Abyss. I won’t tell you where this last critter shows up, but he’\
  s certainly a handful!</p> \n       <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n        <a href=\"\
