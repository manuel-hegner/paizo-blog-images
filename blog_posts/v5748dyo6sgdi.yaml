  \ \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">The world of Verces is a tidally locked planet,\
  \ one hemisphere always facing the sun as it makes its orbit. As such, half of the\
  \ planet is baked by constant heat, while the other half is a frozen wasteland.\
  \ However, a strip of habitable terrain circles the planet where the two sides meet,\
  \ a temperate zone in a state of constant twilight. Most of Verces's sentient life\
  \ evolved in this area, which eventually became known as the Ring of Nations, a\
  \ unified coalition of countries.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     \

  \ <a href=\"/products/btpya17d?Starfinder-Adventure-Path-The-Penumbra-Protocol\"\
  ><i>Starfinder Adventure Path #11: The Penumbra Protocol</i></a>, the heroes travel\
  \ to Cuvacara, the capital of Vimal, one of the larger nations on Verces. Known\
  \ as the \"Dusk Jewel,\" Cuvacara is a bustling metropolis that is home to the Assembly\
  \ of Nations, where the Ring of Nations' government council meets to make policies.\
  \ Thousands of cybernetics and computer corporations own offices and factories in\
  \ Cuvacara, and the heroes must investigate one of these companies to learn more\
  \ about the creepy incidents that befell them on the asteroid resort New Elysium\
  \ in the previous adventure. But, of course, not everything is what it seems to\
  \ be, especially in a city like Cuvacara, where every shadowy alleyway has the potential\
  \ to hide a deadly secret.</p> \n     <p>Both \"The Penumbra Protocol\" adventure\
  \ and the accompanying Cuvacara gazetteer were written by Jenny Jarzabski, turning\
  \ from the warm glow of the sun in the Starfinder Society scenario \"The Solar Sortie\"\
  \ to these neon-drenched streets. (Hmmm, I guess we like giving Jenny alliteratively\
  \ titled adventuresâ€¦) Jenny introduces us to a wide variety of Cuvacaran citizens,\
  \ but rather than describe them and spoil all the surprises, I thought we would\
  \ show off this incredible map of the Dusk Jewel. Those gray lines represent the\
  \ city's mass transit system: elevated bullet trains that can transport passengers\
  \ around Cuvacara in a matter of minutes.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ></a> \n      <br><i>Illustration by Damien Mammoliti</i>\n     </div> \n     <p>The\
  \ citizens of Verces are known to embrace cybernetic augmentations and Cuvacara\
  \ is no exception. In fact, the city is on the cutting edge of these enhancements\
  \ and experimental cybernetics are often available in the Dusk Jewel before they\
  \ hit the wider marketplaces. A handful of new Vercite augmentations are presented\
  \ in this volume, including these bionic knees, which I would definitely purchase\
  \ in real life as I get older.</p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-title\"\
  ><b>Bionic Knees</b> <span class=\"stat-block-cr\"><b>System</b> All legs</span></p>\
  \ \n      <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>PRICE</b> 2,750 <b>LEVEL</b> 5</p> \n   \
  \   <hr style=\"margin: 0.5rem 0;\"> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-1\">Complex actuators\
  \ and servos are installed in your knees, giving you the power to make impressive\
  \ leaps. You always count as having a running start when attempting Athletics checks\
  \ to jump. In addition, you don't fall prone if you fail an Athletics check to jump\
  \ by 5 or more. Finally, the damage you take from the first 10 feet of a fall is\
  \ converted into nonlethal damage, even if you aren't falling onto a yielding surface.</p>\
  \ \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>Finally, in addition to some creepy new monsters\
  \ by Jenny Jarzabsi and James L. Sutter and a glimpse of planet ravaged by Hellfire\
  \ by Owen K.C. Stephens, this volume presents a detailed look at the shadowy fiends\
  \ known as velstracs by Isabelle Lee. These twisted outsiders have unsurprisingly\
  \ embraced the modern technology of the Material Plane, some of them integrating\
  \ such equipment into their own forms as they seek an undefined perfection of body\
  \ and mind. With some gruesome magitech augmentations and painful weapon fusions,\
  \ this article certainly isn't for the faint of heart!</p> \n     <p>That's all\
  \ I can really reveal without spoiling too much about the <a href=\"/store/starfinder/adventurePath/signalOfScreams\"\
  >Signal of Screams Adventure Path</a>, but hopefully this tantalizing preview will\
  \ get you exciting to enjoy the scares and thrills of <a href=\"/products/btpya17d?Starfinder-Adventure-Path-The-Penumbra-Protocol\"\
