  \ \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">One of the advantages of this team's creating\
  \ organized play scenarios for the better part of a decade (it surprises me that\
  \ I can truthfully say that) is that we're now very familiar with how Pathfinder\
  \ Society scenarios are laid out, how we word certain things, and countless other\
  \ nuances. Introducing Starfinder Society gave us (especially Thurston Hillman)\
  \ lots of opportunities to tweak our models to fit a new game system, and in many\
  \ ways it prepared us for the changes we've made in Pathfinder's Second Edition.\
  \ Sure, some of these are editorial minutiae like no longer splitting whether we\
  \ use the preposition \"on\" or \"to\" when referring to bonuses on rolls versus\
  \ bonuses to static values (e.g. AC or CMD). Others are more apparent, such as how\
  \ we arrange encounters, where we place tactics, and how we calculate treasure.\
  \ Learning these new styles and adapting them to organized play has been an experience,\
  \ and we're hoping that this is a first step toward presenting great scenarios in\
  \ the upcoming campaign.</p> \n    <p>One of the most unexpected updates for us\
  \ was how Second Edition shapes those Knowledge checks that appear at the beginning\
  \ of most scenarios (right after the adventure briefing). In the current edition's\
  \ Pathfinder Society scenarios, these provide increasingly specific, esoteric, and/or\
  \ useful information based on the result of a PC's Knowledge check. Some of Second\
  \ Edition's underlying math, <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkod?Critical-Hits-and-Critical-Failures\"\
  >the different levels of success</a>, and other factors make it so that this start-of-scenario\
  \ tradition has to evolve, and Michael, Linda, Mark, and I brainstormed lots of\
  \ different approaches to handling these opening skill checks to learn more. We\
  \ found that there's not one perfect solution in theory, so we've used a different\
  \ model in each of the playtest adventures releasing in August. As we launch these\
  \ scenarios, we'll also be posting survey links to solicit your feedback. As you\
  \ can imagine, we're eager to hear how each of these information-gathering systems\
  \ worked for your table.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\">\n     <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderSociety/20180725-MuckruckerGuard.jpg\"\

  \ hey, that's enough nuts and bolts. If you'd like to know more about the Pathfinder\
  \ Society playtest process, check out the <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkxl?Pathfinder-Society-3-Organized-Playtest\"\
  >Organized Playtest</a> blog. Let's dive into the stories!</p> \n    <p>The early\
  \ public previews of Pathfinder's second edition have relied on two particular adventures.\
  \ Most of our playtesters so far have experienced our demo, in which the PCs clash\
  \ with a cruel Asmodean zealot and his small army of undead. Beginning at PaizoCon,\
  \ we also debuted <i><a href=\"/products/btpya1y3?Pathfinder-Society-Playtest-Scenario-1-The-Rose-Street-Revenge\"\
  >Pathfinder Society Playtest #1: The Rose Street Revenge</a></i> as a lottery event\
  \ that's also appeared at Origins and PaizoCon UK. In the wake of <a href=\"/products/btpy9tld?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-900-Assault-on-Absalom\"\
  >Absalom's grand manumission event</a>(kudos, Liberty's Edge faction!), the city's\
  \ former slaves have found new homes there as the newest free citizens. However,\
  \ someone seems to hold a grudge. Known as the Rose Street Killer, this villain\
  \ has systematically killed or abducted these freed people, and the latest victim\
  \ is a recent recruit of the Pathfinder Society. In this series of four quests for\
  \ 1st-level characters, the PCs follow exciting leads in order to unmask the killer\
  \ and put an end to the attacks once and for all. Not only do these adventures involve\
  \ a visit to the Society's unlikely kobold allies beneath Absalom, but there's also\
  \ a chance to explore the Puddles, a flooded district where volunteer Muckrucker\
  \ guards (like the one illustrated here by Kenneth Camaro) keep the peace. We expect\
  \ this quest series by Leo Glass, Thurston Hillman, Joe Pasini, and Linda Zayas-Palmer\
  \ will be many players' first and fun introduction to Second Edition.</p> \n   \

  ><i>Pathfinder Playtest Scenario #2: Raiders of Shrieking Peak</i></a>, by developer\
  \ Luis Loza. When Pathfinder agent Inisa Ardaali recovered a relic from Iomedae's\
  \ ascension, she took every precaution to get it back to Absalom safely. Instead\
  \ of sailing directly into Absalom's harbor, she landed in nearby Diobel and hired\
  \ a nondescript caravan to cover the rest of the distance overland. Despite her\
  \ preparations, however, her caravan did not reach its destination. They fell prey\
  \ to an unexpected group of bandits, leaving the survivors to limp back to Diobel\
  \ empty-handed. The PCs pick up the robbers' trail and set off into the perilous\
  \ wilderness. Will they forge new alliances with those they find along they way\
  \ or let their blades do the talking? It's up to you to decide. How would you respond\
  \ to this fellow swooping down out of the sky, as illustrated by Josef Kucera?</p>\

  ><i>Pathfinder Society Playtest #3: Arclord's Envy</i></a> by Lyz Liddell. This\
  \ adventure does many things we've always dreamed of: it's a story that takes place\
  \ in Nex, resoundingly reflects its setting in the encounters, and at long last\
  \ shows off the Nexus House (the oldest Society lodge outside of Absalom)! What's\
  \ more, we've introduced the lodge's three caretakers, most notably the esteemed\
  \ gnome Sebnet Sanserkoht (illustrated here by Javier Charro). The 5th-level PCs\
  \ are in charge of a daring whodunit that hinges on a recently discovered text written\
  \ by the archmage Nex himself. This is no mundane investigation, thoughâ€”not in a\
  \ capital city run by wizards, maintained by elementals, and guarded by a pair of\
  \ titanic golems! Because it's possible to replay these playtest scenarios for credit,\
  \ this scenario includes some flexibility for the GM to vary parts of the investigation\
  \ and the culprits themselves in order to keep players on their toes every time.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>And don't forget that we'll also have a 10th-level scenario coming out\
  \ in September! In the meantime, get ready for three great adventures to kick off\
  \ the playtest at Gen Con in style!</p> \n    <p>(And surveys. Don't forget the\
  \ surveys!)</p> \n    <p>John Compton<br> <i>Organized Play Lead Developer</i></p>\
