  \ class=\"PTales\"></div></a> \n   <h1>A Passage to Absalom</h1> \n   <p>by Dave\
  \ Gross</p> \n   <h2>Chapter One: Mulled Wine</h2> \n   <p>The first blush of dawn\
  \ cast the Imperial Shipyards into stark silhouette, a forest of black cranes and\
  \ masts standing on the eastern docks of Cassomir. Along the strand, gulls vied\
  \ with ravens for the shellfish buried beneath a thin blanket of midwinter snow.\
  \ The lapping waves left a sensuous border of sand at the edge of the snowfall,\
  \ like the impression of a woman's lips upon a crystal goblet. Soon the tide would\
  \ recede, and the <i>Sea Lion</i> would set sail for Absalom.</p> \n   <p>The cost\
  \ of passage on the converted freighter had been dear, but I felt anxious to return\
  \ to the City at the Center of the World. Among its hundred wonders was the Grand\
  \ Lodge of the Pathfinder Society, to whose secret masters I would soon report.\
  \ Our expedition to Ustalav had met with mixed success, but now I returned with\
  \ an unforeseen treasure: a copy of the lost <i>Lacuna Codex</i>. Within its pages\
  \ lay magics so fell that even the Whispering Tyrant had feared their discovery.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>A return to Absalom might also assuage the disappointments of our visit\
  \ to Greengold, where traders and diplomats treat with the elves of Kyonin. There\
  \ I had hoped to employ a craftsman to repair my beloved Red Carriage, the sole\
  \ legacy from my elven father. After days of fruitless negotiations with the sheep-faced\
  \ bureaucrats, I realized my half-elven heritage was no advantage to gaining entrance.\
  \ Thus I entrusted my vehicle to storage and chartered a riverboat to Cassomir,\
  \ where I secured passage to Absalom.</p> \n   <p>Beside me, Arnisant sat as still\
  \ as a gargoyle. The stone of the quay must have been cold beneath his haunches,\
  \ but the Ustalavic wolfhound was proving an obedient guardian. I sensed his gaze\
  \ on me but did not return it. It was his part to look to me for instruction without\
  \ expectation of reward. It fell to me to dispense those rewards when they would\
  \ serve to reinforce his training, not simply to cultivate his affection.</p> \n\
  \   <p>My own seat was scarcely more comfortable than Arnisant's. The entrepreneur\
  \ who had established this refreshments pavilion for departing passengers warmed\
  \ his guests with enormous coal braziers, but the furniture consisted of the rough\
  \ benches and communal tables one might expect in a barracks. To deter others from\
  \ sitting too close, I repositioned our luggage on the seats beside and opposite\
  \ my own. Only my most precious satchel, that containing my spellcasting materials\
  \ and the <i>Lacuna Codex</i>, remained by my side.</p> \n   <p>Radovan returned\
  \ from the serving cart with a cup in either hand. One smelled of strong tea. From\
  \ the other rose the scent of cheap wine smothered in clove and cinnamon. He set\
  \ the latter on the table and glanced back to wink at the buxom barmaid, who returned\
  \ his leer.</p> \n   <p>\"How much time we got, boss?\"</p> \n   <p>\"Insufficient\
  \ for dalliance.\"</p> \n   <p>Radovan sighed, but I doubted his sincerity. No doubt\
  \ he wished to maintain his reputation as a ladies' man, but I sensed an air of\
  \ melancholy about him since we departed Caliphas. There he had left behind a Varisian\
  \ hedge-witch for whom I suspected he harbored a lingering devotion.</p> \n   <p>The\
  \ morning air had already cooled the wine, which filled barely more than half of\
  \ the glazed clay cup. I peered at Radovan, who had lately assumed an inappropriate\
  \ custodianship of my consumption of wine and spirits. Considering the other evidence,\
  \ however, it was equally likely that the vendor employed a stingy ladle. My first\
  \ sip of the sour wine confirmed my expectation that, despite the high prices, it\
  \ was the cheapest available.</p> \n   <p>\"Dreadful stuff, isn't it? At least it's\
  \ hot.\" A corpulent man from a nearby table toasted me with his own cup before\
  \ draining it. He winced, his chins wagging as the dregs hit the back of his throat.\
  \ I took him for a merchant, noting that the high quality of his furs and jewels\
  \ belied his coarse manners.</p> \n   <p>So did the woman at his side, who sat with\
  \ the poise of a Qadiran cat. Whatever beauty age had stolen from her she had won\
  \ back in elegance. Her high cheekbones and thin nose marked her as a descendant\
  \ of an old Taldan family. If she were wed to the merchant, I deduced that theirs\
  \ was yet another expeditious marriage between ambitious wealth and impoverished\
  \ nobility.</p> \n   <p>Lest I appear uncivil before the lady, I raised my cup to\
  \ return her husband's salute. The wine was less disagreeable on second sip, more\
  \ for the wine's fortification than for its quality. I drained the cup, careful\
  \ to avoid the sediment, and signaled Radovan to fetch me another.</p> \n   <p>\"\
  Hot this time,\" I said. \"And full to the brim.\"</p> \n   <p>As I turned to give\
  \ him the cup, Radovan pretended to study the ceiling of the tent. I knew at once\
  \ I'd caught him at mischief. Arnisant's drooling jowls confirmed my suspicion.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"How many times must I tell you not to feed my hound?\"</p> \n   <p>Radovan\
  \ shrugged. \"Somebody must have dropped something on the floor.\"</p> \n   <p>I\
  \ saw Arnisant swallow before resuming his stoic posture, which I now realized was\
  \ a ruse born of natural cunning rather than the fruit of my instruction.</p> \n\
  \   <p>\"It is imperative to his training that I alone dispense rewards, and then\
  \ onlyâ€”\"</p> \n   <p>\"Looks like last call,\" said Radovan. \"Better hurry.\"\
  \ He returned to the wine cart, where the barmaid greeted him with a lascivious\
  \ wetting of her lips.</p> \n   <p>I checked my impulse to scold Arnisant. Negative\
  \ reinforcement is effective in the short term, but it would only muddle the more\
  \ potent accumulation of reward-for-behavior training. Still, I disliked the notion\
  \ that Arnisant might divide his loyalties. I was the dog's master, not Radovan.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>I showed Arnisant the sign to lie down. When he obeyed, I bade him roll\
  \ over, rise, stand, and return to his seated vigil. Only then did I reward him\
  \ with a sliver of beef liver sausage from a pouch among the many in which I had\
  \ secured my riffle scrolls.</p> \n   <p>Wiping my hands upon a fresh linen handkerchief\
  \ from my sleeve, I saw the merchant rising from his table. For a moment I feared\
  \ he might introduce himself, but instead he bustled past me to visit the wine cart.\
  \ On his way he stumbled into a young Qadiran woman whose snug winter clothes failed\
  \ to conceal the rich curves of her figure. I wondered how she had escaped Radovan's\
  \ attentions until I saw the barmaid's finger hooked into my bodyguard's collar,\
  \ pulling him close to whisper in his ear.</p> \n   <p>I resigned myself to the\
  \ prospect of another cup of tepid wine.</p> \n   <p>The sun had risen high enough\
  \ to reveal the details of the harbor. Across the bay to the north, the triple towers\
  \ of Harbor Watch stood vigil over the docks. Ballistas, catapults, and trebuchets\
  \ fairly bristled on their many platforms, promising doom to any vessel so rash\
  \ as to assault the shipyards. A great rusty chain descended into the water from\
  \ the southernmost tower, but I had read more than one report suggesting this hull-breaking\
  \ chain had never been completed, its appearance merely a stratagem to deter ambitious\
  \ armadas.</p> \n   <p>\"Quite a sight, isn't it?\" The young elf pacing the perimeter\
  \ of the pavilion blew at the steam rising from his cup. His sallow complexion and\
  \ nervous gaze lent him the aspect of a scholar. Upon his shoulders he bore a tall\
  \ woven backpack that sagged with the weight of its contents. I knew him at once,\
  \ not as an individual but as one of a breed of optimistic youngsters I had encountered\
  \ year after year via the Pathfinder Society. No doubt he dreamed of traveling Golarion\
  \ and uncovering ancient secrets, beginning his apprenticeship in Absalom.</p> \n\
  \   <p>As I turned to speak with him, however, the boy shied away like a colt. If\
  \ that was the extent of his spirit, his over-stuffed pack would seem all the heavier\
  \ for his disappointment when he was turned away from the Grand Lodge.</p> \n  \
  \ <p>The remaining occupants of the wine tent were a pair of dwarves. They were\
  \ obviously traveling companions, one scowling as he observed the porters loading\
  \ crates onto the ship, the other distracting his companion with jests at the expense\
  \ of their fellow passengers. When his gaze fell upon me, the jocular dwarf sketched\
  \ a bow that seemed more friendly than insolent. I returned the courtesy with a\
  \ scant nod.</p> \n   <div class=\"blurb360\">\n    <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Pickpocket.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Pickpocket_360.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n    <br> \"Pretty or not, she needs to keep her\n    <br> hands off other\
  \ people's purses.\"\n   </div> \n   <p>The merchant's wife favored me with a bright\
  \ smile, which I returned with as little encouragement as possible. Her expression\
  \ faltered somewhat as she understood that I wished to be left alone, but she masked\
  \ her disappointment with the practiced grace of noble breeding.</p> \n   <p>The\
  \ shadow of Grayguard Castle crept toward us by the time Radovan disentangled himself\
  \ from the barmaid, who clutched his coins with more ardor than she put into her\
  \ smile. Yet perhaps I do him an injustice. Despite his infernal ancestry, Radovan's\
  \ knack for enchanting women verges on the uncanny.</p> \n   <p>That was an interesting\
  \ thought. Among the benefits of his tainted blood were an ability to see in total\
  \ darkness and a certain resistance to the effects of heat and flame, which lately\
  \ seemed to have evolved into a remarkable transformation triggered by great fire.\
  \ Unfortunately, he rebuffed my proposal to study his metamorphosis. A few simple\
  \ experiments might determine whether heat or flame was the true catalyst, and whether\
  \ time or tranquility caused him to revert to his half-human self. Was his unlikely\
  \ charm another quality of his unusual condition?</p> \n   <p>The woman fell upon\
  \ me before I could react. By the time I heard Arnisant growl a warning, she clutched\
  \ at my neck and shoulder. My own arms instinctively encircled her body, pulling\
  \ her close to prevent her head from striking the table. For an instant I thought\
  \ it was the merchant's wife who had tripped over the satchel at my feet, but it\
  \ was the young Qadiran woman.</p> \n   <p>Her momentary struggle before settling\
  \ on my lap evoked an involuntary reaction that she could not fail to notice. In\
  \ the private company of a gentlewoman of certain charms, I should have welcomed\
  \ the phenomenon. Yet we stood exposed to the public eye, and she was no lady.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>The young woman smothered a giggle with her gloved fingers.</p> \n   <p>\"\
  I beg your pardon,\" I said, although I was hardly responsible for our collision.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"That's quite a tower you've erected.\" She did not refer to the luggage.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Not six feet away, the talkative dwarf guffawed. Behind him, his companion\
  \ frowned at the disturbance, while the young elf ceased pacing, frozen and staring\
  \ like a startled hare. Near them, the merchant's wife covered her blush with a\
  \ lace fan, while her husband bit his knuckles to stop his own laughter.</p> \n\
  \   <p>\"Nice try, sister.\" Radovan pulled the woman from my lap. She struggled\
  \ to escape, but he held tight to her arm while slipping a hand beneath her cloak.\
  \ Before she could scream, he removed his hand and dangled my purse before her eyes.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>This time the merchant could not help but laugh. \"That's very good, don't\
  \ you think, my dear?\"</p> \n   <p>His wife nodded, but her eyes lingered on Radovan\
  \ as he favored the pickpocket with the lopsided leer he calls \"the little smile.\"\
  </p> \n   <p>\"What's your name, sweetheart?\" Radovan asked.</p> \n   <p>Her hesitation\
  \ was almost imperceptible. \"Shadya.\"</p> \n   <p>\"What are we going to do about\
  \ this little incident? If I call the guards, we're going to miss our boat.\"</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Shadya slipped out of his grip. She raised a defiant chin and glared back\
  \ at him, rubbing her arm where he'd bruised her. \"What do you want?\"</p> \n \
  \  <p>Quick as an adder, Radovan slipped an arm around her waist and bent her low\
  \ for a kiss. She struggled briefly while his fingers explored every contour of\
  \ her body.</p> \n   <p>The merchant's wife was the first to turn away. A moment\
  \ later, she prodded her husband with the fan, and he cast his gaze to the floor.\
  \ The elf and the cheerful dwarf stared, one gaping, the other grinning. The dour\
  \ dwarf cleared his throat.</p> \n   <p>I could bear it no longer. \"That is quite\
  \ enough, Radovan.\"</p> \n   <p>He released the woman and returned to my side.\
  \ She retreated, her expression wavering between confusion and outrage.</p> \n \
  \  <p>Radovan returned my purse. \"That's all she got.\"</p> \n   <p>While no doubt\
  \ he enjoyed the pretense of collecting a kiss, I knew its true purpose was to search\
  \ the woman for any other items she might have stolen.</p> \n   <p>\"Passengers\
  \ aboard!\" the burly captain bellowed from the edge of the gangplank. The ship's\
  \ mates arrived to transfer our luggage to our cabins.</p> \n   <p>As a spindly\
  \ sailor approached to take our bags, I noticed that the leather latch on the most\
  \ precious of my satchels lay unsecured. I opened it, my heart racing. What I feared\
  \ had occurred.</p> \n   <p>The <i>Lacuna Codex</i> was missing.</p> \n   <br> \n\
