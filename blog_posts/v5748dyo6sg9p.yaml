  \     </div> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">The folks from the Order of the\
  \ Amber Die are churning through the Pathfinder Playtest. Here is the next report\
  \ from their table as they play through the second chapter of <i>Doomsday Dawn</i>!\
  \ If you intend on playing through this adventure, maybe wait to read this part\
  \ after you're done, because there are spoilers aplenty in this blog post!</p> \n\
  \     <blockquote> \n      <p>After our initial experience in <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo670md?Order-of-the-Amber-DieDoomsday-Dawn-Playtest\"\
  >part one of the Playtest</a>, we were eager to employ some of the already released\
  \ errata and ride headlong into part two. Discovering a <i>countdown clock</i> was\
  \ on our Pathfinder bucket list for a while now, so we dialed up some lighting to\
  \ match the southern continent, and prepared to set out on a cross-country trek.\
  \ In typical OAD fashion, we tapped a live NPC to play our animal companion, and\
  \ our GM rendered another one of those maps that made us scared to even put our\
  \ hands on.</p> \n      <h2>The Party</h2> \n      <p>To better craft a party suited\
  \ to what we were allowed to know about this section of the playtest, we opted away\
  \ from our standard method of playing iconics; instead, we drew upon inspiration\
  \ from one of our past campaigns and created an entirely wilderness-oriented party.\
  \ The party was given the same name as their predecessor, The Lost Arrows, who consisted\
  \ (then and now) of four companions well accustomed to outdoor adventure. What we\
  \ didn't know when we initially answered a request in Kelmarane, was that we'd have\
  \ to navigate a tomb complete with traps and confined spaces. After an anxious mission\
  \ briefing, we were confident we could at least beat our opponents—the Night Heralds—\
  in a race across Katapesh to the tomb.</p> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-title\"\

  \ \n      <h2>Highlights From \"In Pale Mountain's Shadow\"</h2> \n      <p>While\
  \ traversing the slopes of Pale Mountain, we were ambushed by a classic foe—a manticore—\
  that had everyone eager to see how the beast would perform with its new makeover.\
  \ When our GM landed six out of his first eight tail spikes (including two critical\
  \ hits and a nasty new ability that pinned our barbarian in place), it was already\
  \ time to pull out the stops. That sleep arrow listed above? Yeah, Sean pulled it\
  \ off.</p> \n      <p>Each character had their moment to shine during part two;\
  \ when it came to the barbarian, the playtest rules felt right at home alongside\
  \ our favorite iterations of the class over the years. Gnolls twice attempted to\
  \ swarm Ithilian with their pack attack ability, but his raging damage numbers quickly\
  \ turned whack-a-mole into wreck-a-gnoll.</p> \n      <p>Inside the Tomb of Tular\
  \ Seft, we came across a puzzle which involved a series of elemental equations.\
  \ To solve it, we felt sure we'd need a party more suited to dungeon crawling. Not\
  \ so, and after drawing upon a variety of skills to produce several stellar DC 25\
  \ checks, we had the doors open and our goal close at hand.</p> \n      <h2>Character\
  \ Deaths</h2> \n      <p>If we were to rank our TPKs across 147 adventures, PC party\
  \ vs. NPC party would easily hold the record for the deadliest conflicts out there.\
  \ Logan Bonner, well played. We owe you one.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ \n      <h2>Current Situation</h2> \n      <p>From the outset of the final encounter,\
  \ it was clear that The Lost Arrows and the Night Heralds had entered into a fierce\
  \ skirmish from which only one party would survive.</p> \n      <p>Our ranger went\
  \ down as fast as his animal companion, followed by the barbarian. Nemus, the druid,\
  \ tried to buy enough time for Keleth to whisk the <i>countdown clock</i> to safety.\
  \ Using a combination of elven ancestry, Nimble, and Fleet, the elf performed his\
  \ best version of the 4x40 and tried to outrun the only enemies capable of pursuit.\
  \ The Night Herald's scout pursued him out onto the ledge and into Pale Mountain's\
  \ shadow, stopping to let off shots that only created distance with each miss. Just\
  \ a few yards from maximum range, our GM knew the only way to deliver a hit would\
  \ be a natural 20. He reached for the Amber Die itself. It did what it's done for\
  \ decades, and we could only offer reverence.</p> \n      <p>Follow Order of the\
