  \ Player's Guide Classes</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Thursday, August 20, 2009</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Now that Gen Con is over, it is time to look into the future of the Pathfinder\
  \ Roleplaying Game. Over the next year, we have a number of fantastic products in\
  \ store for you, but the one that has me the most excited is the <i>Advanced Player's\
  \ Guide</i>. We gave a few hints about this hefty 320-page tome at Gen Con during\
  \ the Pathfinder RPG Q&amp;A seminar, but I wanted to take a moment to bring the\
  \ news to you directly.</p> \n   <p>First off, this book is set to release at Gen\
  \ Con 2010. It will include a host of new options and avenues for characters built\
  \ using the classes and features in the <i>Core Rulebook</i>. That means you can\
  \ expect to find new barbarian rage powers, new sorcerer bloodlines, new bardic\
  \ performance options, and a host of other tricks and tools to modify the 11 core\
  \ classes. The book will also contain a number of feats, spells, and magic items\
  \ to expand your game. We are providing all of these in one book so as to avoid\
  \ spreading out the goodness over a host of tomes, which tends to just make things\
  \ difficult to find and use. Some of this material will be leaked early through\
  \ this blog to use right away (and to help us playtest some of the more tricky aspects).</p>\
  \ \n   <p>In addition to the expansion of the core classes, this book will also\
  \ contain six new base classes. They are called base classes because they go from\
  \ level 1 to level 20, but they are not core classes. Confused? Allow me to explain.\
  \ We are making an assumption that these new classes will take a role in our world\
  \ (and possibly yours) that is less common. You will not find them in every adventure,\
  \ nor will they appear in every product. That means that you can introduce them\
  \ to your game in a more limited fashion, without having to retcon them into every\
  \ facet of your campaign.</p> \n   <p>Of these six classes, I am ready to talk,\
  \ in a limited fashion, about four of them. I should note that these classes are\
  \ still being designed and everything you read here is subject to change. That said,\
  \ we are really excited about the ideas, and hope that you will be too.</p> \n \
  \  <p>When working out some of the initial concepts for these classes, we had two\
  \ primary criteria that each needed to fill: a conceptual niche and a mechanical\
  \ niche. This means that each class we come up with needs to include mechanics that\
  \ we do not currently explore with one of the 11 other classes, as well as its own\
  \ conceptual space.</p>\n   <p> </p>\n   <p>The first class I want to look at is\
  \ the Cavalier. While traditionally, this class has been focused on mounted combat,\
  \ we have learned that classes such as this suffer terribly by the circumstances\
  \ of the adventure. As such, the cavalier is going to have some aspects that make\
  \ it a great mounted combatant, but it will also focus on directing and controlling\
  \ a battlefield through a system of class features that allow it to enhance allies,\
  \ unnerve opponents, and challenge foes. Unlike a bard, the cavalier will focus\
  \ on individuals instead of large numbers, allowing it to have some greater effects.\
  \ The class will not rely on spells or magic to get the job done, but it will be\
  \ a bit more skill-focused than some of the other martial classes, especially when\
  \ it comes to Charisma-based skills.</p> \n   <p>Next up is the Alchemist. Now,\
  \ I know what you are thinking. Brewing alchemist fire and crafting tindertwigs\
  \ is not the stuff of adventurers, and hardly enough to build an entire class around.\
  \ On that, I would agree, but we are taking this in a slightly different direction.\
  \ Think of the alchemist a bit more like Dr. Jekyll. He brews up elixirs, mixes\
  \ up unguents and powders, and crafts all sorts of tricks to use in a fight. While\
  \ some of these will certainly mimic spells, others might allow him to gain fiendish\
  \ qualities, breath fire, or even transform into a puddle of living ooze. At higher\
  \ levels, he will be able to use some of his concoctions on others, granting them\
  \ some of his strange abilities. This class will work like an arcane caster, in\
  \ that he will prepare his alchemy for the day and use them as day goes on, as they\
  \ most likely do not keep for long. There will undoubtedly be a host of new alchemical\
  \ items in the book for him to tinker with as well.</p> \n   <p>Next up is the Summoner.\
  \ I should note that the title for this one is still a bit temporary as it does\
  \ not quite convey the concepts we are looking for. This class is focused on the\
  \ creation or summoning of a monster combatant or guardian. Think of it as a sort\
  \ of arcane animal companion that is a magical beast, outsider, or aberration instead\
  \ of an animal. While the class will still be able to cast arcane spells, in a bit\
  \ more of a limited fashion than a sorcerer, it will have a number of abilities\
  \ to enhance and empower its creation. Some of these will be able to be applied\
  \ on the fly, while others will happen only when the summoner gains levels. The\
  \ class will have a list of abilities that can be added to a monster as you gain\
  \ levels, with more powerful abilities made available to use in your monster's construction\
  \ at higher levels. To top it off, the class will be a bit variable in theme. You\
  \ could be a pious summoner, creating a divine champion to guard and protect you,\
  \ or you could be a foul chirurgeon, creating your monster from the corpses of other\
  \ dead monsters.</p> \n   <p>Finally, the last class I want to talk about is the\
  \ Oracle. This class is a spontaneous divine caster that is not devoted to any one\
  \ god. Instead it is devoted to a particular concept or domain. The oracle draws\
  \ his power from all the deities that support that concept, but none of them particularly\
  \ hold any domain over him. A great example here would be Hercules, who would make\
  \ a great oracle of strength. The class provides spontaneous divine casting, but\
  \ the focus provides a host of other abilities and powers. You could expect feats\
  \ of great might from the oracle of strength, while the oracle of fire is probably\
  \ going to be able to roast you alive if you anger him. Think of the oracle more\
  \ as an expert on a single topic and less as a seer of the future and you are close\
  \ to the theme we are going for. I am really excited about what this class could\
  \ do and the roleplaying options it presents. I might even have to give my current\
  \ character a break to play an oracle as soon as the class is ready.</p> \n   <p>That\
  \ covers four of the six classes in the book. I am planning on releasing information\
  \ about the other two next month, at a seminar taking place at Gen Con Australia,\
  \ in Brisbane. These classes will be put up for public playtest well before the\
  \ book goes to print, and as soon as the schedule is finalized, you will find it\
  \ here on this blog. I hope to have some more news on these classes, as well as\
  \ a few sneak peaks before the playtest, as they develop. Stay tuned.</p> \n   <p>Jason\
