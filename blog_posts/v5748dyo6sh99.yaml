  >blog several weeks ago</a>, we made a call to the community to submit their ideal\
  \ pantheon for inclusion in Pathfinder Society. After several stages of selection\
  \ by judges at the <a href=\"http://knowdirectionpodcast.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\
  >Know Direction Network</a> and review by the organized play team, we’ve got four\
  \ finalists to introduce to our community. Voting opens today and runs through 11:45\

  \  <h3>The Strings of Fate</h3> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p><b>Alignment</b>\

  \ <p><b>Author Description</b> Devotees of the Strings of Fate understand that dreams\
  \ can give glimpses of what’s to come - but can also be used as a tool to manipulate\
  \ the future for one’s own ends. Those who bring good cheer, pleasant dreams, and\
  \ hope for the future (even false hope) often focus their worship on Desna, while\
  \ those who manipulate others through fear and nightmares choose Groetus as a patron.\
  \ Those who venerate this pantheon also hold special reverence for Shyka, honoring\
  \ the Eldest’s understanding of both past and future, and also Grandmother Spider,\
  \ who pulled and weaved the strings of fate for her own purposes. The name of the\
  \ pantheon itself highlights the core belief of worshipers of the Strings of Fate\
  \ - our fate is certain, but those who can pull the strings of fate can make the\
  \ most of its power.</p> \n     <hr> \n     <h3>Path of The Heavens</h3> \n    \
  \ <blockquote> \n      <p><b>Alignment</b> CG (NG, CG, CN)<br> <b>Areas of Concern</b>\
  \ Celestial bodies, navigation, travelers<br> <b>Divine Font</b> <em>heal</em><br>\
  \ <b>Divine Ability</b> Intelligence or Wisdom<br> <b>Divine Skill</b> Survival<br>\

  \ of the stars, moon and planets<br> <b>Anathema</b> mislead a traveler, permanently\
  \ blind an enemy<br> <b>Favored Weapon</b> Starknife</p> \n     </blockquote> \n\
  \     <p><b>Author Description</b> The Path of The Heavens is well known to those\
  \ who make their way in Golarion. Looking down from above, they help travellers\
  \ and voyagers find their way. For some, this guidance is more spiritual. They seek\
  \ to know the progress of Sarenrae, the sun, Tsukiyo, the moon, and Desna the stars,\
  \ and through this knowledge gain enlightenment. Nocticula for her part uses the\
  \ cover of the darkness, the gaps in between the others, to shelter travellers and\
  \ outcasts. Some who worship her as their primary deity in the pantheon, seek to\
  \ use the void and darkness between the stars to defend voyagers on the road. This\
  \ path is frowned upon by the other members of the Path of Heavens but does not\
  \ seem to disrupt the harmony between the gods. </p> \n     <hr> \n     <h3>Inspired\
  \ Soul</h3> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p><b>Alignment</b> LN (LG, NG, N)<br> <b>Areas\

  \ <b>Edicts</b> perfect your body through disciplined training, seek truth over\
  \ tradition, share your knowledge freely with others, exercise your mind and inspire\
  \ others through art and craft.<br> <b>Anathema</b> succumb to gluttony and material\
  \ possessions over knowledge and discipline, destroy that which others created,\
  \ stifle creativity and knowledge, withhold information for the sake of keeping\
  \ secrets.<br> <b>Favored Weapon</b> staff</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p><b>Author\
  \ Description</b> The Insightful Soul combines the discipline and training of Irori,\
  \ strive for knowledge of Nethys, and creativity and passion of Shelyn. Other deities\
  \ found within the Insightful Soul are Kurgiss (seeking physical perfection), Gruhastha\
  \ (protecting knowledge and seeking truth), and Casandalee (knowledge and creation\
  \ from all aspects), Inspired Souls come from all walks of life. A creative artist\
  \ with a disciplined routine will continuously improve their craft; a dedicated\
  \ yet free-thinking scholar can open their mind to creative solutions; a disciplined\
  \ swordsman can flow more smoothly and improve their reactions by allowing their\
  \ true selves to show in their fighting style. Inspired Souls spend their lives\
  \ balancing discipline and artistry, believing that a disciplined mind and body\
  \ balanced with the freedom to think and move expressively centers their soul helping\
  \ them become their true self.</p> \n     <hr> \n     <h3>Trinity of the Bereaved</h3>\

  \     <p><b>Author Description</b> Golarion is a wild and dangerous place where\
  \ many men, women, and children meet their ends well short of a full life. Those\
  \ who are lost to the perils of the wilderness, famine, overcrowding, or even the\
  \ mortal psyche leave behind others who loved them and grieve their absence. This\
  \ collective grief brings together three disparate goddesses. Pulura is often called\
  \ upon not only by the lost but those left at home whose loved ones are lost at\
  \ sea or in the wild. Those whose loved ones have died in drownings at sea or by\
  \ taking their own lives often demand answers from Naderi. Andoletta is seen as\
  \ a matronly mentor to the other two, having been drawn to them by the kindness\
  \ they displayed in their efforts to console those who mourn.</p> \n     <div class=\"\
