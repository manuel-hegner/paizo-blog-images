  \   </div> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">“Please, Dhareen,\
  \ must we go through with this? A bit of rock climbing is hardly a challenge for\
  \ the Castrovel Kid!” Dhareen imagined her mentee thrusting his chest out proudly,\
  \ thumb pressed triumphantly above his heart as he blustered several feet below\
  \ her. She smiled to herself and pushed her piston-puncher into the mountain’s side,\
  \ activating the gadget with a press of her lowleft thumb.</p> \n     <p><em>Kuh-klank.</em></p>\
  \ \n     <p>“Perhaps, but it is custom among the tribes for a Yavnii to administer\
  \ a test to every hopeful Brekai wanting to undergo the Test of the Mountain, and\
  \ I am afraid that not even I have the authority to make exceptions to shobhad tradition.\
  \ Not even for the ‘Castrovel Kid.’”</p> \n     <p>“See, you say that, but I can\
  \ hear your grin,” Vellero replied sullenly.</p> \n     <p>“I know not what you\
  \ mean.” Dhareen grinned again.</p> \n     <p>Both gladiators fell silent as they\
  \ climbed, Dhareen pausing her ascent long enough for Vellero to scale up alongside\
  \ her.</p> \n     <p><em>Kuh-klank.</em></p> \n     <p>He had taken to her tutelage\
  \ well. Ka’s cliffside was grueling even for an expert; twenty-two miles long and\
  \ comprised of thin basalt overtop stronger metamorphic stone, careless climbers\
  \ often plummeted to their deaths after relying on pistons pounded into brittle\
  \ basalt. One of the many roles of a yavnii was to ensure their breknai did not\
  \ succumb to such a fate. Vellero had learned Dhareen’s lessons well thus far, scaling\
  \ around several patches of basalt she had left in his path as a test.</p> \n  \
  \   <p><em>Kuh-klank.</em></p> \n     <p>Vellero’s concentration reminded Dhareen\
  \ of when she first met the headstrong lashunta in the ring at Arl’s VitariTech\
  \ Coliseum. They were competing in the Icons Grand Brawl, and he was favored to\
  \ win. The young man was a crowd pleaser on a seven-match winning streak. He was\
  \ good, but not good enough; Dhareen scrubbed the floor with her future friend’\
  s face. Literally. Nevertheless, there had been a spark within Vellero, a spark\
  \ that intrigued her. The second time she knocked him down—or perhaps the third—\
  he clamored to his feet with a bruised antenna and a few chipped teeth, wiped fresh\
  \ blood from his lip, and grinned.</p> \n     <p>“Why do you persist?” Dhareen had\
  \ asked, scarcely winded. “You cannot win. You bring yourself only pain. Throw your\
  \ towel; others have when facing me. There is no shame in surrendering to your better.”\
  </p> \n     <p>“You’re right,” he’d replied. “But that wouldn’t be fair for the\
  \ folks who came here to see me fight, and I don’t want to let a single person in\
  \ this ring who believed that I could win down.” He raised his fists into a boxer’\
  s stance, a pointless gesture against an opponent twice his size with twice as many\
  \ fists. “When I go down, I want them to know I gave it my all!”</p> \n     <p><em>Kuh-klank.</em></p>\
  \ \n     <p>“I don’t mean to sound indignant,” Vellero interrupted Dhareen’s thoughts.\
  \ “I know that the Test of the Mountain is sacred to your people, and that it is\
  \ an honor to be allowed to undergo it as an outsider.” </p> \n     <p>Dhareen raised\
  \ an eyebrow. “But?”</p> \n     <p>“But,” Vellero took a breath. “Is the reason\
  \ we’re doing this,” Vellero gestured out behind them, over red dunes and rolling\
  \ clouds of dust. “Because you don’t think I can?”</p> \n     <p>“If I didn’t think\
  \ you could pass the Test of the Mountain, I wouldn’t have begun the climb with\
  \ you, nor permitted you to undertake it.” Dhareen’s voice was gentle but her statement\
  \ absolute. “The mountain is sacred to my people. We do not tolerate bloodshed on\
  \ Ka. To send one who is unprepared up the Mountain is as shameful as slaying one’\
  s enemies at its base.” </p> \n     <p>Vellero’s expression softened slightly. “\
  Thanks.”</p> \n     <p>“Do not speak of it. You don’t want your throat to dry from\
  \ the ascent.” </p> \n     <p>Vellero blinked, then burst out laughing.</p> \n \
  \    <p>“I don’t understand what you find so funny about that. You’ll have twenty\
  \ miles left when we’ve reached the end of our shared path.” </p> \n     <p>Vellero\
  \ kept laughing for a minute, wiping tears from his eyes. “Thanks, Dhareen.”</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“You’re—”</p> \n     <p><em>Kuh-<b>KUN.</b></em></p> \n     <div class=\"\

  \  <p>Dhareen gave herself no time for thinking. Before the sound of shattering\
  \ basalt reached her ears, before Ka itself folded like a withered tumblefern in\
  \ a windstorm, she whipped around to where Vellero was climbing even as his cliffside\
  \ shifted downward, a cascade of metamorphic stone tearing free from Ka and tumbling\
  \ towards the ground below. Vellero screamed as he fell, but Dhareen plucked him\
  \ from the air like a corpseheron snatching a leaping spookfish out from the Irkonian\
  \ Sea. Dhareen didn’t speak Ysoki, but she had spent enough time around ratfolk\
  \ gladiators at VitariTech to recognize the lashunta lambasting the situation with\
  \ at least six of the fourteen different Ysoki swears that she knew.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>“Hold on, Vellero!” Climbing down wasn’t an option; a rockslide was eminent,\
  \ and the best place to be during a rockslide was above it. Vellero was much smaller\
  \ than she and less experienced at climbing, he would only slow them down. She could\
  \ climbe faster with all four of her muscled arms free, anyway. There was only one\
  \ option remaining. </p> \n     <p>Hoisting the Castrovel Kid onto her shoulders\
  \ like a mother giving a youngling a backride, she placed the much smaller lashunta\
  \ onto her shoulders and started climbing as fast as she could, giving only the\
  \ barest of warnings. “Hold tight!”</p> \n     <p>Though Dhareen could hear Vellero\
  \ shouting, her intense focus and the earsplitting sounds of portions of the rock\
  \ wall sloughing off afforded her no opportunity to comprehend him. She climbed\
  \ as quick as her body would allow, muscles aching and flaring as she abandoned\
  \ her piston-punch and climbed barehanded. She knew full-well that the smallest\
  \ mistake would send both she and her friend to their doom.</p> \n     <p>Ten yards\
  \ from the top.</p> \n     <p>Five.</p> \n     <p>She was going to make it.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>She and Vellero were going to make it.</p> \n     <p>Then her world\
  \ shook as shadow overtook her vision. A boulder dislodged from above, tumbling\
  \ towards her, threatening to crack her skull and send Dhareen and her breknai tumbling\
  \ miles to their death. She refused to close her eyes; she would greet the Lady\
  \ of Graves with firsthand tales of how she died. She was not alone; at the peak\
  \ of her vision, she saw a small lashunta arm, no bigger than that of a shobhad\
  \ child’s, reach out as if to catch the boulder. Dhareen admired Vellero’s bravery\
  \ one last time.</p> \n     <p>The boulder collided with Vellero, and for a moment\
  \ it was like watching a diver plunge into a serene pool. Vellero’s hand, then his\
  \ arm, and then both their bodies plunged into the boulder. </p> \n     <p><em>Was\
  \ it just an illusion?</em></p> \n     <p>Fine dust covered Dhareen as the boulder\
  \ passed through her. From within, she watched the metamorphic rock splinter and\
  \ crack in flight, first into smaller boulders, then into stone and pebbles, and\
  \ finally into dust. The boulder never touched them; it dissolved before it even\
  \ struck the Castrovel Kid’s hand.</p> \n     <p>Dhareen was stunned at first. But\
  \ with safety just a few yards above and Ka continuing to shake and splinter, the\
  \ feeling passed quickly as she bellowed at her peculiar friend.</p> \n     <p>“\
  That, Vellero! Keep doing that!”</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p style=\"font-weight:\
