  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Thursday, August 10, 2017</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"\
  > \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Since the announcement of the Starfinder Society\
  \ Roleplaying Guild, us members of the Organized Play team have been getting a lot\
  \ of questions about the differences between Starfinder Society and Pathfinder Society.\
  \ So, we agreed that it was probably a good idea to do a blog on some of the major\
  \ changes. And awaaaaaaaay, we go!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\">\n     <a href=\"\
  /image/content/Starfinder/PZOSFS000E-Drake.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/Starfinder/PZOSFS000E-Drake_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <h2>Starship Combat</h2> \n    <p>Let's start with something\
  \ big. <i>Spoiler Alert</i>: Starfinder has starships. In fact, starship combat\
  \ is a major part of the <a href=\"/products/btpy9qy1\"><em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em></a>,\
  \ and it's something that the Organized Play team was keen on incorporating into\
  \ Starfinder Society play. We're aiming to keep starship combat a fairly relevant\
  \ part of the campaign and look to include such encounters at about a \"one out\
  \ of every four scenarios\" ratio. In fact, three of our five Gen Con release events\
  \ include starship combat.</p> \n    <p>While Starfinder has robust rules for creating\
  \ and customizing starships, those rules don't necessarily translate well into an\
  \ organized play environment. It can sometimes take a lot of time to introduce yourself\
  \ and your character, let alone spending time customizing a completely new starship\
  \ for every scenario you play! To alleviate some of this stress, the Starfinder\
  \ Society Roleplaying Guild employs a duo of robust starship frames that players\
  \ can select during the course of play: the <i>Drake</i> and the <i>Pegasus</i>.\
  \ In a scenario involving starship combat, the PCs select one of these two starship\
  \ frames at the same time they would slot their boons. Once selected, the PCs can\
  \ further modify the <i>Drake</i> and <i>Pegasus</i> with additional modifications\
  \ via the starship boon slot.</p> \n    <p>The <i>Pegasus</i> is a ship in line\
  \ with Starfinder ideals, as it includes expansion bays that house a science lab\
  \ and a tech workshop for out-of-combat assistance. It's also a faster ship, capable\
  \ of quick speeds and easy turning during starship combat. The <i>Drake</i> is a\
  \ different breed of starship, capable of filling the stars with missiles. We wanted\
  \ to give players two distinct options: a lighter faster ship with some added expansions,\
  \ and another ship that was all about taking a beating and retorting with overwhelming\
  \ firepower. Given that missiles have a limited firing capability, you might want\
  \ to consider taking a look at the Abundant Ammunition boon we previewed in <a href=\"\
  /blog/v5748dyo5lk0g?Faction-Overview-Acquisitives\">an earlier blog</a>.</p> \n\
  \    <p>The Organized Play team is excited to see how starship combat turns out\
  \ in the campaign. John and I have both run playtest games to test out the system,\
  \ and it really proved to be quick to pick up for our players, but also had a lot\
  \ of intricacies for players to really dig into. And for those of you who are on\
  \ the hunt for super unique boons... suffice it to say, I don't think the Drake\
  \ and Pegasus will be only the available starships in the campaign for very long.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurb360\">\n     <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/PZOSFS0000\
  \ E-Pegasus.jpg\"><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/PZOSFS0000E-Pegasus_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <h2>Alignment &amp; Infamy</h2> \n    <p>Alright, let's\
  \ just get it out of the way right awayâ€”you can't play an evil character in the\
  \ Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild.</p> \n    <p>The Organized Play team knows\
  \ that many players want to dance around the darker ends of the alignment spectrum,\
  \ but we also know that it can be a real detriment to the enjoyment of other players\
  \ at the table. One thing Starfinder Society let us experiment with is the idea\
  \ of letting PCs make ignoble decisions. To that end, the Starfinder Society Roleplaying\
  \ Guild tracks alignment infractions into a new system that we refer to as Infamy.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>A PC can have anywhere from 0 to 3 Infamy. A character starts with 0\
  \ Infamy, but that score rises it if the PC partakes in any evil actions. Wanton\
  \ acts of destruction, murder, and even unsanctioned thievery are all potential\
  \ sources of Infamy. Since Starfinder lacks an atonement spell, Infamy acts as a\
  \ means of tracking a character's progression towards evil. Each point takes the\
  \ PC a step closer to becoming irredeemable and ineligible for future missions within\
  \ the Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild. Luckily, Infamy is not permanent, and\
  \ can be bought off using Fame. The cost for such expenditures is fairly steep (about\
  \ two scenarios worth of Fame), but some faction boons help assuage the cost. If\
  \ a PC (NOT player) has 3 Infamy at the end of a scenario, she's barred from participating\
  \ in the Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild unless she spends Fame to reduce her\
  \ Infamy score at the end of the session. If that character can't afford to pay\
  \ off the Infamy, then that character is permanently retired from play.</p> \n \
  \   <p>Some of you folks out there might be thinking of ways to maximize this system,\
  \ and you might be thinking \"So I can accrue Infamy up to 2 and then just buy off\
  \ whenever I decide to be a jerk after that?\" While this is certainly an option,\
  \ there is one last part of Infamy that's going to keep the wise PC away from accruing\
  \ it. Infamy directly impacts PC purchasing power; the more Infamy a PC has, the\
  \ lower her effective level is for the purpose of acquiring gear. A PC touting 2\
  \ Infamy will find that she can only purchase equipment listed on a Chronicle sheet\
  \ at a reasonable level, while ordinarily available gear suddenly becomes nearly\
  \ impossible to find!</p> \n    <p>Like all of our new systems, the Organized Play\
  \ team is excited to see Infamy in action. Personally, I've been enjoying seeding\
  \ in some Infamy situations into scenarios, and I think it's entirely possible that\
  \ we'll end up with NPCs and boons that change based on how much Infamy a PC has\
  \ collected.</p> \n    <h2>Lightning Round!</h2> \n    <p>Finally, I wanted to give\
  \ some quick overviews of other pertinent changes between the Pathfinder Society\
  \ Roleplaying Guild and the Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild.</p> \n    <p><b>Scenario\
  \ Tags</b>: Each scenario now has a tag, located on the table of contents page,\
  \ that details some key rules associated with the scenario. This is where you'll\
  \ be able to tell if a scenario includes starship combat, is repeatable, if it has\
  \ a faction mission, and several other options!</p> \n    <p><b>Registering Characters</b>:\
  \ The Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild will use the same player numbers as Pathfinder.\
  \ The only difference is that your character number will start with in the 700's,\
  \ such as -701, -702, et cetera.</p> \n    <p><b>Adventure Path Play</b>: Since\
  \ Starfinder Adventure Paths are shorter than their Pathfinder counterparts, the\
  \ entirety of the Starfinder Adventure Path adventures are sanctioned for Organized\
  \ Play. Our first sanctioned adventure is <a href=\"/products/btpy9tmf?Starfinder-Adventure-Path-Incident-at-Absalom-Station\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Adventure Path #1: Incident at Absalom Station</em></a>, which should\
  \ be ready in time for Gen Con!</p> \n    <p>Purchasing: As hinted at above, purchasing\
  \ works a bit different in Starfinder. Since most equipment is based on item level,\
  \ PCs will have access to equipment based on their relative level compared to the\
  \ item. Items found on Chronicle sheets will be accessible sooner than items from\
  \ the <a href=\"/products/btpy9qy1\"><em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em></a> or alternate\
  \ sources.</p> \n    <p>That's it for our first Gen Con release previews. We'll\
  \ be posting a few more in the coming days, so stay tuned!</p> \n    <p>Thurston\
