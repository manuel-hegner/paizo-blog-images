  \ can shape the fate of a nation. Spies, assassins, and cultists rub shoulders with\
  \ nobles and sages, and all of Taldor stands open for canny adventurers to save\
  \ or exploit. But how do elves fair in the bustling human courts? What role does\
  \ a woodsy hunter or foreign psychic have to play in events? This player's guide\
  \ contains plenty of information and advice for the themes and challenges yet to\
  \ come, and what classes and character options can help you prepare for them!</p>\

  ><em>Crownfall</em></a>, already on store shelves, everyone has been eager to see\
  \ the Player's Guide as well to finally get started on their own campaigns. In addition\
  \ to the usual character advice, the guide also includes a short, spoiler-free primer\

  \ on those from Ultimate Intrigue, not to mention a bonus NPC statblock for Princess\
  \ Eutropia, a longstanding figure in the Inner Sea political arena!</p> \n    <p>Sieze\
