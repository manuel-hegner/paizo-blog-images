              <div itemprop="articlebody"> 
               <p itemprop="description">It's that magical time of year again when I break my time into 30 minute chunks as I leap from state to state and country to country for the annual ritual of level-draining known as "Con Season." I only just returned to the States from (the absolutely wonderful, it must be said) PaizoCon UK, and here I sit in my office with only a few more working hours before it's time to head out to the big one—GEN CON!</p> 
               <p>This year marks my 22nd consecutive year at the convention, and I'm still just as excited about going as I was that very first year. Since I haven't gotten a chance to actually play a game at Gen Con since the 1990s*, these days the aspect of the convention that most gets my blood pumping is the chance to see old friends from all over the world in the evenings. Also, for about an hour on Sunday, after all the business meetings and seminars and media interviews are over, I like to speed-walk the trade hall on the hunt for new miniatures!</p> 
               <p>All of the best minis manufacturers are present at the show, displaying their latest and greatest offerings. Because of strange timing this year, WE don't have any brand new WizKids <a href="/pathfinderbattles">Pathfinder Battles</a> sets to show off, though we will have a few cases of <a href="/products/btpy9er4"><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a> that we managed to find recently. So if you missed that much-in-demand set the first time, you'll have a chance to check it out in the Paizo booth (#103).</p> 
               <p>We'll also have a few new metal miniatures from our friends at Reaper Miniatures making their debut in the Paizo store, including iconic characters from <a href="/products/btpy9egu"><em>Occult Adventures</em></a> and a few other exciting surprises.</p> 
               <p>As in past years, we've set up a special promotional repaint miniature FREE with purchases of $50 or more at the Paizo booth. This year's promo mini is the Blue Guard, a repaint of the Guard from <a href="/products/btpy9er4"><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a> that we've produced in extremely limited quantities. We should have a FEW of this guy left over for sale here on paizo.com after we get back from the show, but I wouldn't expect him to last long. He's really cool, and guards are the type of figures most GMs want by the small handful.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK72052-8-10-PR1.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK72052-8-10-PR1_120.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>We'll also be giving away top-secret promo repaints to all ticketed players of the Friday and Saturday night Pathfinder Society Specials in the massive Sagamore Ballroom. If you're there on Friday night especially, there's a good chance that I or a member of the Paizo editorial staff will hand-deliver your limited-edition figure, just by way of saying "thanks" for playing Pathfinder and enjoying what we do. We couldn't do it without you, and a free miniature every once in a while is but a token of our appreciation for your continued gaming loyalty and support.</p> 
               <p>But most of you won't be at Gen Con, and you're probably eager to see more previews of figures from the upcoming <a href="/products/btpy9kcu"><em>Deadly Foes</em></a> set. I've been on the road at conventions the last two Fridays, so it's understandable if everyone is a little bit starved of previews.</p> 
               <p>So let's get on with it!</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160729-Peri.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160729-Peri_360.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>It's unbelievably hot in Seattle right now, so today's previews both involve FIRE! Up first we have the Peri, from <a href="/products/btpy8odu"><em>Bestiary 3</em></a>. Peris are a race of celestials native to the good-aligned Outer Planes, but they are often found in the company of mortals on the Material Plane. Sworn enemies of divs, Peris are drawn from Persian mythology, and their fiery wings certainly give them a nifty appearance. At CR 14, you're gonna want a pretty titanic battle to make up for these guys being in the Common rarity slot, but hey, at least they look really sweet with clear wings and a great sculpt. The Peri is a Medium figure.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160729-Erinyes.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160729-Erinyes_360.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>As I sit here writing this, the sun is beating into my office, which has surely grown as hot as the flaming bow of this incredible Erinyes devil. It's difficult to believe it's taken us this long to create one of the most iconic and beloved devils, but some of our early sets were so filled with winged female fiends that I wanted to wait for the right time for this specific creature to strike. WizKids has done a phenomenal job with the sculpt—don't let the relatively simple paint job fool you. This one is a winner. The Erinyes is a Medium, uncommon figure.</p> 
               <p>And that's it! I'm off to Gen Con. If you can catch me between meetings in the Paizo booth, I'd love to chat with you about <a href="/pathfinderbattles">Pathfinder Battles</a>, miniatures in general, or pretty much whatever! It's great to get to see our customers face-to-face at the show, and more than a few of those conversations have resulted in figures added to the line, so you never know! I'm always open to suggestions.</p> 
               <p>See you at the show, or see you back here in a couple weeks!</p> 
               <p>Until then, I remain...</p> 
               <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p> 
               <p class="tiny">* Ok, that's a bit of an exaggeration! I'm actually playing in a LIVE Pathfinder game this year with Jason Bulmahn, F. Wesley Schneider, and Crystal Frasier! It's the Live RPG Plus "celebrity" gaming event on Saturday night at 7:00 in the Westin Capitol III room. I understand tickets are still available. You can find more information <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/299974263683090/" target="_blank">HERE</a>!</p>

               <p>We're getting ever closer to the release of <a href="/products/btpy9nfu"><em>Pathfinder Module: Gallows of Madness</em></a>, which means it's finally time to reveal some of the maddeningly enticing tidbits this book has to offer!</p> 
               <p itemprop="description">And there is a lot to be excited about. For starters, <em>Gallows of Madness</em> is one of the most versatile modules we've ever published. The module consists of three adventures for first- or second-level characters, and these adventures can be played as standalones, in any imaginable two-part arc, or all together, like a traditional module-length adventure. The beginning of the book includes detailed instructions for how to build a story that fits GMs' needs and interests, as well as tips to make the story feel as immersive as possible.</p> 
               <p>Beyond this, all three adventures were written with GMs' ease in mind; most of the content comes from the <a href="/products/btpy88yj"><em>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</em></a> and <a href="/products/btpy8auu"><em>Bestiary</em></a>, so it's perfect for beginning GMs and GMs who are running these adventures on the fly. That said, there are a few elements in the adventures that are brand new, both from a story and a rules perspective, ensuring that even veteran players and GMs will stay on their toes. Without providing too many spoilers in this direction, let's just say that the module's title is both figurative and very literal.</p> 
               <p>Wholly aside from the module's format, there's another thing that has us stoked; this module gives players and GMs the first detailed look at Saringallow. This large town in Isger has a dark history involving diabolist Chelish nobles; PCs who play these adventures will have nuanced conversations with the locals, including Mayor Sandra Trinelli, that can shed light on this tragic past.</p> 
               <p>The individual adventures take place either in Saringallow proper, in the wilderness surrounding the settlement, or in the abandoned Sarini Estate, but regardless, the PCs will have the chance to confront the settlement's past while grappling with new threats that could spell a whole new type of doom in the very near future.</p> 
               <p>To learn more, you'll have to pick up the book. For now, I'll simply leave you with this gorgeous half-page illustration of the old Sarini Estate.</p>

              <p>But why stop there? Gen Con's traditionally the <a href="/pathfindersociety">Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild's</a> opportunity to release a few extra adventures. This year, thanks to the July release date being so close to the convention itself, it's almost as though they were one and the same—at least that's how it's felt around here! As a result, we have 11 exciting adventures we're featuring at the convention. Let's take a look!</p> 
              <p>Nearly six years ago, the Pathfinder Society traveled to a promising archaeological site known as <a href="/products/btpy8g1o">Azlant Ridge</a> outside Bloodcove at the edge of the Mwangi Expanse. Ever since then, I've heard players ask what became of that site and if the Society had uncovered more of its mysteries. At long last, we've returned, guided by contributor and veteran Pathfinder Society author Ron Lundeen, taking your Tier 3-7 characters deeper into the Terwa Uplands in <a href="/products/btpy9m04"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #7-27: Beyond Azlant Ridge</em></a>! This was also our opportunity to depict the unflappable Juliet Dias, the expedition's manager shown below.</p> 
              <p>Something's rotten in the state of Thuvia, and although the Pathfinder Society has <a href="/products/btpy9k9">uncovered a vile plot</a> and <a href="/products/btpy9k93">helped thwart it</a>, the mastermind is still on the loose. Thankfully, a key member of the plot has reconsidered her loyalties and has reached out to the Society for help, as she has learned that the villains intend to cast the Thuvian city-states into civil war in a bid for personal power. Political intervention isn't the Society's standard practice, but if a band of elite agents can thwart this conspiracy, avert disaster, and also eliminate the ringleader of the Korholm Agenda, it's worth entering hostile territory. Luis Loza brings Season 8 to a climatic, Tier 7-11 close in <a href="/products/btpy9m03"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #7-28: Ageless Ambitions</em></a> in Aspenthar, domain of the ambitious Prince Zinlo (pictured below)!</p> 
              <p>In April we began a grand undertaking with <a href="/products/btpy9k93"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #7-20: All for Immortality, Part 1: First Taste of Eternity</em></a>: the reintroduction of dedicated, high-level content in the Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild. So far the feedback we've received has been really encouraging—certainly making us consider more Tier 12-15 content in the future—and working on the series (including some ludicrous hard mode options) has been a lot of fun. Of course, high-level content benefits from high-level settings, and what better place is there for a Pathfinder to go than the heart of the Aspis Consortium. I've left the fate of the Consortium is in your hands in <a href="/products/btpy9m02"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #7-29: All for Immortality, Part 3: Serpents Fall</em></a>!</p> 
              <p>And because I'm a glutton for punishment, I took on a second adventure during this busy time: an exciting sequel to last season's <a href="/products/btpy9cu0"><em>Pathfinder Society Special #6-98: Serpents Rise</em></a> that sends a motley band of 8th-level Aspis agents and misfit hirelings deep into Nidal to infiltrate a threat to the Consortium's authority. We debuted <a href="/products/btpy9lzy"><em>Pathfinder Society Special #7-98: Serpents' Ire</em></a> at PaizoCon 2016, and it's undergone some polishing since then to trim its run-time, making it a great fit for Gen Con this year.</p> 
              <p>The pregenerated character adventure model has proven an exciting way to tell stories happening outside the Grand Lodge—especially when showing what's in store for the campaign's next season. Developer Linda Zayas-Palmer has also worked behind the scenes on many of our best scenarios and the Campaign Clarifications document, and this time the stars aligned for her to apply her narrative mastery and author the spectacular <a href="/products/btpy9mbd"><em>Pathfinder Society Special #7-99: Through Maelstrom Rift</em></a>. An organization known as the Concordance of Elements has sensed a dangerous anomaly on the Plane of Air, and the ruling council (including one of its representatives pictured below) has dispatched an eclectic team representing the united elemental forces to avert the looming disaster and discover its cause. If the idea of playing a proud genie, a miniature dragon, or an elemental serpent made of living lava strikes your fancy, don't miss this great adventure for 6th-level pregenerated characters.</p> 
              <p>Phew! Time to catch my breath for a moment.</p> 
              <div class="blurb360" style="width: 380px;">

              </div> 
              <p>In Season 4 of the campaign, the Society spent a lot of time in Varisia. We've taken an extended break in the years since, but with the imminent release of the updated <a href="/products/btpy9nme"><em>Pathfinder Adventure Path: Curse of the Crimson Throne</em></a>, the prospect of visiting Korvosa again was just too good to pass up. You may recall that the Society has a good friend, Zeeva Foxglove, who runs the nearby <a href="/products/btpy8u8s"><em>Green Market</em></a>, and she's contacted Venture-Captain Sheila Heidmarch with a desperate plea for assistance. Scott Sharplin spins us an engaging urban adventure with mysteries, plots, and just a hint of pseudodragons in the Tier 1-5 <a href="/products/btpy9mba"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-01: Portent's Peril</em></a>.</p> 
              <p>One of the greatest strengths of Pathfinder Society scenarios as a medium is that they allow us to explore such a wide variety of places in the course of a year. I'm always looking for more ways to feature Tian Xia, and we planted a pretty significant plot hook <a href="/products/btpy9cty">near the end of Season 6</a> in the hope of traveling to the sorcerer kingdom of Dtang Ma. An unlikely ally (the friendly disembodied head pictured below) has pointed the Society to an abandoned temple that still contains historical records dating back a millennium or more. The PCs tread on sacred ground, though, and they must watch their step if they are to scale a mountain, study this lost site, and save a lost soul. Contributor Mikko Kallio shows off his story-telling talents in <a href="/products/btpy9mbb"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-02: Ward Asunder</em></a>, a Tier 3-7 adventure.</p> 
              <p>Two years ago, hundreds of Pathfinders <a href="/products/btpy97n3">gathered in the halls of the sky citadel Jormurdun</a> to reclaim it for study. The Society turned control of it over to the dwarves of the Five Kings Mountains shortly thereafter, and they have industriously worked to restore their ancestral home. The duergar of the nearby Darklands are none to thrilled about this development, and in a recent attack, they captured a host of dwarves, put them in chains, and began driving them south toward a future of slavery or sacrifice. Jormurdun has asked the Society to intercept the duergar before they escape, but taking on such a large force won't be easy. Mike Kimmel takes the PCs deep underground to gather allies and launch a daring rescue in <a href="/products/btpy9mbc"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-03: Captives of Toil</em></a>, which has special opportunities for members of the Liberty's Edge faction.</p> 
              <p>Wait, you want more? Sure, I've got three more gems for you.</p> 
              <p>We're debuting a new set of six 1st-level quests by Eleanor Ferron, and Jenny Jarzabski, and Landon Winkler. In <a href="/products/btpy9mb9"><em>Honor's Echo</em></a>, the PCs assist a disenfranchised Taldan nobleman, the descendant of the heroic Honaria Alcasti whom the empire used as a scapegoat centuries ago. In order to restore the family's name, he and the PCs search Taldor, Andoran, and Qadira for evidence of Honaria's good deeds and make a case before one of Taldor's most influential figures. Like past quest series, Honor's Echo is for 1st-level pregenerated characters, but we are decoupling past quest series (i.e. <a href="/products/btpy98nh"><em>The Silverhex Chronicles</em></a> and <a href="/products/btpy9fi8"><em>Phantom Phenomena</em></a>) from the pregenerated character requirement.</p> 
              <p>Gen Con is also the debut of Pathfinder Academy, an extension of previous years' Kids Track program. This year we're adding a five-quest series dubbed Transitions that teach players key lessons—attacks of opportunity, splash weapons, combat maneuvers, conditions, and more—as they graduate from the <em>Beginner Box</em> to the full Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. After each short lesson is an adventure that highlights those rules and follows the story of the heroes tracking down villainous Aspis agents who have stolen holy relics from Magnimar. By the end, the players are ready to participate in some Pathfinder Society adventures. In fact, we've dedicated several tables to kid-friendly games—some even run by young GMs! Seth Brummond, Andrew Hoskins, Bob Jonquet, Nathan King, Lucas Servideo, and Michael VonHasseln contributed a combination of adventures, lessons, and wisdom to make this project a reality.</p> 
              <p>Finally, there's the big interactive event: <a href="/products/btpy9mbe"><em>Pathfinder Society Special #8-00: The Cosmic Captive</em></a> by Matt Duval! The asteroid known as Aucturn's Tear flies through the solar system every 56 years, but strangely it has begun glowing brightly in the night sky while opening portals to another realm as it passes by planets. Hmmm... the more I talk about the story, though, the more I spoil the adventure. Let's boil it down to a few key points. First, we're exploring new design territory for interactive adventures, combining both traditional aspects of the interactive experience with a host of new ways to affect other tables. Second, it's loaded with elemental goodness—and not just the “I'm immune to critical hits” elementals, but also fun elemental themes and locations. Third, it's the first interactive adventure to combine the Roleplaying Guild and Adventure Card Guild into one giant event. Finally, it's a stellar debut to an incredible new season: The Season of the Stolen Storm!</p>

             <div itemprop="articlebody"> 
              <p itemprop="description">At PaizoCon's "Horror in RPGs" seminars, in products like <a href="/products/btpy8j5u"><em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Rule of Fear</em></a>, and pretty much wherever else I'm given the chance, I've talked quite a bit about how to run unsettling Pathfinder games(—you're all coming to our <a href="http://gencon.highprogrammer.com/gencon-2016.cgi/event/SEM1699489" target="_blank">Horror in Pathfinder event at Gen Con, right?). In writing Chapter 6 of </a><a href="/products/btpy9n5a"><em>Pathfinder RPG: Horror Adventures</em></a>, Running Horror Adventures (and in the book's section on "Playing Horror a Hero"), I've compiled some of my creepiest techniques and gaming philosophies, sharing them to help all you GMs out there make your Pathfinder games truly frightening.</p> 
              <p>But creating a truly unnerving game isn't as simple as choosing the scariest monsters and dreaming up spooky plots. To that end, the chapter starts by asking what you're trying to accomplish by running a horror game. A horror game is—obviously—meant to be "horrifying," but who are you as the GM trying to horrify? The characters or the players? And, in either case, are the players cool with that? The GM and players being of the same mind regarding the experience they're sharing is one of the most overlooked but most important parts of running a horror game, so we cover all that right up front.</p> 
              <p>Once we're certain everyone's in for horror, the chapter delves into a discussion of several popular horror genres—like cosmic horror, ghost stories, gothic horror, and others. Beyond just the themes and plots associated with these genres, each explores tools in the Pathfinder RPG that can help you affect these specific modes of terror. Want to know what monsters work best for slasher horror? No prob. Want some basic and advanced plots for running psychological horror games? I've got you covered. Not sure what a body horror game is? Oh boy, do I have some stories for you.</p> 
              <div class="blurbCenter">
               <a href="/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PZO1135-CosmicHorror.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PZO1135-CosmicHorror_360.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PZO1135-ReapersBargain.jpg"><img src="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PZO1135-ReapersBargain_180.jpeg"></a>

              </div> 
              <p>But even the best rules and plots are only stepping-stones to creating unsettling game experiences. Therefore, a meaty chunk of the chapter provides some of my favorite tips for steeping your game in an ambiance that lets fear flourish. These go beyond just tips for lighting and sound, providing simple and reasonable theatrics GMs can employ to keep their players engaged, as well as ways players can contribute to a sense of fear and mystery. Maybe even more useful, there's also a solid list of things NOT to try.</p> 
              <p>One of the most important elements of building a game's atmosphere, though, is to keep up the momentum. There's nothing creepy about interrupting the game to flip through rulebooks for 10 minutes. So, to help avoid that, the chapter's final section covers rules ad-libbing. These are things you can do to use the rules you know (or have on hand) to roll with whatever crazy scheme the players come up with. Beyond just telling you what every veteran GM already knows—that you can tinker with the rules as much as you want—this section gives you a step-by-step process on how to think like an ad-liber and how to kit-bash whatever rules you need on the fly. As a result, it walks you through how to run situations like being buried alive or burned at the stake using bits from the rules toolbox you already have.</p> 
              <p>Overall, the chapter is designed to be a guide to running horror games, but there are a ton of tools here to add to your bag of GMing tricks. Chapter 6 of <a href="/products/btpy9n5a"><em>Horror Adventures</em></a> helps you learn what sort of story your players are up for, assists you in setting the stage, and then gives you techniques to make PCs dread what's to come. Those skills are handy for running a horror game, but, in my opinion, they're vital to any Pathfinder game you want to make truly memorable.</p> 
              <p><a href="/products/btpy9n5a"><em>Pathfinder RPG: Horror Adventures</em></a> debuts in just a few short weeks. Look for it here on paizo.com, your local game store, or at the Paizo booth at Gen Con!</p>

              <p>Hello and welcome, friend! We here at Sandermane Archives are pleased to offer the most thorough genealogical services in all of—oh, you're a sorcerer.</p> 
              <p>No, no! Don't say anything. You're screaming it loudly enough already, from that tacky dragon tattoo to the gaudy "gold" embroidery on your robe. Who even wears a robe in the summer? I just want one month to go by without seeing one of you deadbeats in here!</p> 
              <p>Let me guess? You know a few fire spells, some scales on your tuckus, and you daddy's cousin's great-aunt claims she spent a sweaty summer night with Mengkare. And now you want me to dig up some proof of their salacious interspecies gambol so you can embrace your destiny or claim your family fortune or settle a drunken bet?</p> 
              <p>Well you know what? <i>You're paying up front!</i> I'm tired of getting stiffed when you lot find out there's not a drop of dragon blood in your veins, and storm out in a huff!</p> 
              <p itemprop="description">Oh, what's that? You say "Mom had a tail, so grandma must've been a dragon!" Pssht! Dragons are a half-step down from gods, and you're about three square meals better than a goblin. And I know you know that; that's why you want me to tell you you're really half-dragon. But a dragon wants to make babies with you about as much as you want to make babies with your rose bush! Sure, there might be a few weirdoes out there, but that takes some pretty low self-esteem or a legendary quantity of whiskey!</p> 
              <p>Oh, but you're so sure you're the exception, are you? Ha, I say! Ha! Remember when I said they were close to gods? They change all the rules. Make 'em <i>funny</i>. They don't need carnal relations to leave their mark on the world. Maybe your grandpappy was a loyal servant for some wyrm, and just picked up a little taint to his blood hanging around so much—happens to kobolds all the time! Or maybe your great aunt helped slay an ancient wyrm. Or was standing too close when someone else did. Maybe your mom built her farm over the grave of some long-dead dragon's hoard. There was a lass in here last Rova, we figured out she wound up a sorcerer because her alchemist dad got addicted to dragon's blood! Never met a dragon his whole life; just bought the blood from a shifty-eyed dwarf, then his daughter winds up with claws and spells and a hankering for rubies.</p> 
              <p>Wouldn't have happened in my day.</p>

              <p>It's not all bad. So you can't order your dragon grandma to lay waste to your enemies or claim some legendary pile of gold. Most folk can't! But see dragons impact everything they brush up against, not just people. They leave knowledge and magic and treasure wherever they go, and weirder bits, too. Dragons change the way the world works, and if you study them, you can too! There are these eccentrics in Katapesh can draw out dragon magic by worshipping dragons like gods—even turn into dragons, from what I hear! And Druma has these witches, they learn their magic by gathering up hoards of gold, no spooky deals with the powers-that-be required. Heck, we got a gladiator in this city who claims she learned to fight from a linnorm, and to see the way she tears open anyone that hits her, you'd believe it. You think you're limited without dragon blood, but the truth of the whole deal is that you're never limited just by your blood.</p> 
              <p>That's why being a genealogist is better than being well-bred!</p> 
              <p>Of course, you're still limited by your gold. Secrets don't come cheap, whether they're family indiscretions or secret techniques to tame a drake. One advantage to the many, many egotistical sorcerers who walk through those doors and hire me to peek into draconic history is that I have become quite the tidy expert of the subject—Probably the foremost in this city, at any rate—and I just happen to keep a copy all of my notes in this <a href="/products/btpy9nfl">conveniently portable little folio</a>. It's certainly a good deal cheaper—and less disappointing—than paying me to plot out your family tree on the off chance you have some scaly kin lurking around.</p> 
              <p>And look at the bright side: If you buy <a href="/products/btpy9nfl">the folio</a>, you never have to grapple with the existential dread that comes with discovering you're descended from a kobold.</p>

              <p itemprop="description">Time to catch you up on the story so far in <a href="/pfsacg/products/season2">Season of the Runelords</a>! (There be <i>plot spoilers</i> below.) While I'm discussing SotRu, allow me to apologize for the persistent delays in its release schedule. We're working hard to improve the process for subsequent products, and the entirety of the season will be available for play at Gen Con.</p> 
              <p>The season begins with a lowly party of wannabe adventurers banding together to visit the town of Sandpoint, with an eye toward becoming famous heroes like those who defeated Karzoug, the ancient Runelord of Greed. (This adventure is loosely based on the events of the <a href="/products/btpy921r"><em>Pathfinder: Dark Waters Rising</em></a> comics by Jim Zub.) Sandpoint being Sandpoint, you run into some nasty, filthy goblins before you even get into town. These particular goblins are even more disgusting than usual: they're covered in oozing, mottled pustules that have a tendency to pop.</p> 
              <p>After you dispatch the goblins, you barely make it into the city limits before the mayor turns you around and sends you after the black dragon who's treating Sandpoint's cattle farms as his personal all-you-can-eat buffet. Unfortunately, instead of vanquishing Black Fang and saving the day, you just make him really mad and he swears vengeance against the town. Being a hero is not as easy as it looks.</p> 
              <p>In an attempt to curry favor with the town council, you investigate the matter of the mutated goblins, and discover that someone's been up to no good in the wilds around town. After suffering goblin explosions of various types, you discover that a devotee of Lamashtu has set up her own mutant gobbo factory as a first course, feeding the goblins some sort of heinous potion to turn them explode-y. The main dish will be her spawning some sort of abomination linked to the Mother of Monsters. It's nice when it's easy to tell what the right course of action is, huh?</p> 
              <p>With the Lamashtu-spawn and its incubator taken care of, you return to Sandpoint to find the council member who led you into the goblin trap. Turns out he's the manipulator behind all the shenanigans, and he needs a good thumping before he uses some of the aforementioned potion on the dragon that's got it in for the town. It would be great if you could stop him before that happens, wouldn't it?</p> 
              <p>Ah, well. Beating down mutant dragons is good practice for heroes like you.</p> 
              <p>Having saved/wrecked the town of Sandpoint, you feel ready for a greater challenge/would like to avoid being run out of town on a rail, so you make for Magnimar, famed City of Secrets. (This adventure is inspired by the <a href="/products/btpy9dxu"><em>City of Secrets</em></a> comics, also by Jim Zub.) You arrive just in time for Xanderghul's Night (he was the Runelord of Pride) and just in time to save a wedding from some demonic party crashers.</p> 
              <p>Your convenient heroics bring you into the orbit of Lieutenant Kasadei of the City Watch, who has a number of tasks for irregulars with good instincts and timing. Kasadei sends you into Underbridge, a promising-sounding area of Magnimar, where some rogues' guilds are having a bit of a turf war. Your diplomatic abilities, though rusty, should prove sufficient to the task of fairly divvying up whatever they're fighting over.</p> 
              <p>Next up is an investigation into some shapechanging shenanigans, in which some prominent local citizens are being impersonated. Turns out the creepy doctor with the sanatorium is behind it all, which is completely shocking. The prominent local citizens are pleased with your work, so you are promoted to guarding a special exhibit at the Museum of Ages from the expected assaults of some Cultists of the Crimson Eye. The Pathfinder Society (and local luminary Sheila Heidmarch) are pleased with your work, and remunerate you well. Time to head to Hollow Mountain!</p> 
              <p>Well, once you figure out who's murdering all these priests of Sarenrae, anyway.</p> 
              <p>Ever since you decided to become heroes, you've had your eye on Hollow Mountain. It's imposing, it's isolated, and the top of it is carved to resemble Alaznist, the Runelord of Wrath, who is said to have reigned over her territory from the mountain itself. (This adventure is loosely based on the encounters at the end of each <a href="/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics/hollowMountain"><em>Hollow Mountain</em></a> comic by various awesome authors.)</p> 
              <p>You pay a ship's captain to drop you off on the shores of Rivenrake Island, home to both the Mountain and the ruins of an old Thassilonian city, Xin-Bakrakhan. Time to plunder the ruins for sweet loot! Surely everything that lived here died a long time ago.</p> 
              <p>Wrong. Wrong. You were wrong about everything here being dead. This place has angry, angry inhabitants. Because you're mighty adventurers, you triumphed, but that was not a pleasant experience. Some things you can't unsee. Still, you found a passageway that heads down into the stone, and therefore theoretically into Hollow Mountain. Heroic stories tell you that secret ways are better ways for exploring, so you set off.</p> 
              <p>Hey, this cavern has a big tower in it! Towers mean mages, which means pricy magic items and other valuables. As it turns out, it also means some sort of clockwork sentries and a nasty tower guardian. The cavern also has other stuff in it, and it messes with your stuff and tries to kill you, because that's the sort of place this is. This is what you wanted: adventure and danger and glory. You repeat that to yourself as you wipe splattered polyp and fungal spores off your face. Soon, you'll be inside the mountain, and you'll make your bones and feature in all the bard's songs.</p> 
              <p>Until next time, Pathfinders!</p>

              <p>By the way, if you haven't gotten tickets yet, there are still some available. Come on out, say hi, and play a few games of Pathfinder Society. Ya know you wanna! Hot events include the Thursday night and Saturday night Specials, the Adventure Card Guild component of our interactive special, and the launch of Season 8. For you early risers, or those that just don't go to bed, we are giving an extra prize token during our morning slot. All the Pathfinder Society offerings may be found at <a href="http://gencon.com" target="_blank">gencon.com</a>.</p> 
              <p>But before Gen Con, I am off to Birmingham, United Kingdom, where I have the privilege to attend PaizoCon UK. In fact, tonight is packing and final prep, as I board the plane tomorrow. So exited! Not only is it a chance to visit Merry Olde England, I get to play Pathfinder while doing it. Publisher Erik Mona is also attending and we have some treats for con attendees, including a retired scenario ran by <i>moi</i> and the next chapter in the Spire of Nex! If you've ever fancied traveling and seeing the world, I recommend you put PaizoCon UK on your radar!</p> 
              <p>I would usually have many more words to say, but I've tapped my brain at this point working on Guide revisions, packing lists, emails, and all the other tasks that go into getting the convention together. As long as I remember to eat, drink, and pack my toothbrush, I'll be okay...</p> 
              <p>Next week, John is taking us through the last of the Season 7 offerings—<a href="/products/btpy9m04"><em>#7-27: Beyond Azlant Ridge</em></a>, <a href="/products/btpy9m03"><em>#7-28: Ageless Ambitions</em></a>, and the conclusion of the new Seeker Arc—<a href="/products/btpy9m02"><em>#7-29: All for Immortality, Part 3: Serpents Fall</em></a>. Maybe, if we ask really nice, he will give a hint of what is coming up in Season 8!</p> 
              <p>So, come one everyone—grab your character, sharpen your pencil, and meet me in Indy! Or if you can't make it, find a game near you and post here about your local Pathfinder Society activities!</p>

           <p itemprop="description">New rules for a more nuanced fear track with seven levels, as well as for sanity and madness, allow your group to play around with the psychological consequences of the terrible events that are all too common in a horror game.

Sanity is a sort of mental pool of hit points, and losing too much at once exposes you to a new madness (of increasing severity if your current sanity is below half your maximum).

              <p>Just three short weeks until <a href="/products/btpy9n5a"><em>Horror Adventures</em></a> emerges from the shadows! This week, I'm going to focus on the material in the book that helps GMs enrich horror games, from rules to advice.</p> 
              <p itemprop="description">New rules for a more nuanced fear track with seven levels, as well as for sanity and madness, allow your group to play around with the psychological consequences of the terrible events that are all too common in a horror game. The fear track has a split between lesser fear (which can cause increasing weakness but doesn't make you lose control of your character) and greater fear (where your character is so frightened that they can't help but act on it).

Of course, even if you lose sanity a little at a time, losing all your sanity causes you to completely lose your grip on reality.</p> 
              <p>The environments section contains 30 different creepy locations and hazards, each with their own rules. Locations include pools where a creature's reflection shows their true self (though sometimes, after you trust them, the pool will show your friend to have been replaced by a horrific creature even if she wasn't) and godless voids where divine power can't reach. Hazards range from weak threats witch lights that lead you into a trap and grasping undergrowth that actively impedes you, to major dangers like an honest-to-Desna bottomless pit and the dread apocalypse fog, which animates all corpses within into zombies. Environments also includes rules for domains of evil, dark pockets of supernatural activity embedded in a plane, plus a few horrific traps and a brief look at nightmare dreamscapes.</p> 
              <p>We also have sections for you on curses and horrific diseases, providing a variety of new twists on both topics, including curse templates like death curse and generational curse, disease templates like incurable, magic-resistant, plague, and virulent, tips on creating your own curses. There's even new diseases that all follow their own tracks of progression, like Unchained diseases, but much more personalized and gruesome; for instance bloody end causes blood to seep through your skin as you become prone to fits of rage.</p> 
              <p>The fleshwarping rules are the most PC-friendly of the bunch, at least if the PCs are evil enough to use them. They allow for three sorts of neat fleshwarps: true fleshwarping, where you make a new creature from several old creatures, fleshcrafting, where you graft tentacles, antennae, tails, and more onto a creature, and fleshwarp mutations, which are usually unintentional results of failed experiments, radiation, or other mutagenic experiences.</p>

              <p>The haunts section is one of the true gems of the entire book. First of all, it contain delightfully twisted haunts from CR 1/4 all the way to the incredibly deadly CR 20 twisted wish haunt (pictured here, as Valeros wishes for more ale). It also has new haunt elements like elusive and latent. But the coolest part is probably the variant haunts, which shows how to use the haunt rules to create experiences other than hauntings from dead souls that are dealt with in ways other than positive energy. The variant haunt types are dimensional instabilities (places where the veil between the Material Plane and another plane is thin), maddening influences (tied to the reality-warping influence of eldritch beings and defeated with dangerous Knowledge), magical scars (places where dozens of powerful spells were hurled together), and psychic haunts (gatherings of emotional energy that can be defeated by calming them down with Diplomacy). Each variant also comes with an example haunt.</p>

              </div> 
              <p>In terms of monsters, we have a template for dread lords who rule evil domains, three hive creatures to go with the hive corruption, the Jason-like implacable stalker template (Vorhees, not Bulmahn) that can appear behind you and resurrect itself in your nightmares, the apostle kyton template for those transfigured by kytons, the trompe l'oeil (a creature that emerges from a painting), unknown (a fey that feeds off mental energies and erodes others' psyches until they too become unknown), and the waxwork creature template for creatures made of wax. There's simple templates associated with the theme of each corruption, in case you need to quickly and efficiently create a chimera whose dragon head is a construct, a dragon that turns into a tyrannosaurus rex every full moon, a vampiric unicorn, or a vegepygmy possessed by the spirit of the creature it once was. There's also two variant types of werewolves and the familial lich, which uses its own family line as a phylactery.</p> 
              <p>The "Running Horror Adventures" chapter, by master of horror Wes Schneider, is another of the books gems, particularly for me, as I've always wanted advice on how to make my horror games work out better. The chapter highlights the challenges of running horror games in Pathfinder before leading out with a preface about out-of-character consent to run horror games. It then explores subgenres of horror (body horror, cosmic horror, dark fantasy, ghost story, gothic horror, psychological horror, and slasher horror), explaining in each case how to tell those sorts of stories (and whether they are particularly easy or hard to tell in Pathfinder) and what sorts of threats and plots work best in a Pathfinder game themed around that subgenre. Afterwards, there's plenty of storytelling and atmospheric tips, tricks, and techniques, both in-character and out-of-character, that can keep both players and their characters on their toes. Finally, there's some suggestions on how to improvise rules for unusual horrific situations, with examples including being buried alive or burned at the stake.</p> 
              <p>With all these new rules at the GM's fingertips, I'm actually a little frightened to play in Developer Linda Zayas-Palmer's next game (she wrote the haunt section, so soon you might be too!). And of course, the book is a perfect companion for those of you looking to check out the <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/strangeAeons">Strange Aeons Adventure Path</a>. Next week, we'll be back with a very special composite preview where a bunch of us share our favorite new toys from <a href="/products/btpy9n5a"><em>Horror Adventures</em></a>!</p>

              <p itemprop="description">The Founding Festival is upon us, and what better way to celebrate the city of Korvosa than with a preview of the updated <a href="/products/btpy9nme">Curse of the Crimson Throne Adventure Path</a> that made it (in)famous?</p> 
              <p>As with the hardcover edition of <a href="/products/btpy8tc0">Rise of the Runelords</a> a few years ago, one exciting element of revising <a href="/products/btpy9nme">Curse of the Crimson Throne</a> was the opportunity to look through all the comments people posted on our messageboards over the years. Feedback, observations, obituaries for dead PCs, obituaries for dead villains, complaints, misunderstandings, corrections, and so much more awaited discovery as I made my way through all those posts in the early days of work on the revision project. But one thing stood out over and above everything else—folks had fallen in love with the city of Korvosa so much that they hated leaving it!</p> 
              <p>While the journey into the Cinderlands and the exploration of a certain infamous castle very much remain integral elements of <a href="/products/btpy9nme">Curse of the Crimson Throne's hardcover revision</a>, I took to heart the complaints folks had about leaving Korvosa behind for two adventures. The fact that this occurred after your player characters likely gain access to fast travel spells like <em>teleport</em>, <em>wind walk</em>, <em>shadow walk</em>, <em>word of recall</em>, <em>transport via plants</em>, and so much more only further complicated the issue. After spending half an Adventure Path defending a city, why would heroes abandon it when returning is often just a spell away?</p> 
              <p>There's all sorts of tiny new additions to the campaign, the single largest addition to <a href="/products/btpy9nme">Curse of the Crimson Throne</a> takes place between books 4 and 5. I won't go into great detail about what this addition consists of, but it DOES involve a return to Korvosa to take care of two particularly vexing groups that your PCs will grow to love hating during the campaign. Expect to encounter some familiar faces, some brand new foes, and at least one established Korvosan NPC who may or may not have a brand new secret (and a lot of brand new powers) to be surprised by!</p>

              <p itemprop="description">Before I jump into this week's preview of the upcoming <a href="/products/btpy9k5m"><em>Goblins Burn!</em> deck</a>, I would like to mention that several Paizo products have been <a href="http://www.ennie-awards.com/blog/2016-ennie-award-nominees-and-spotlight-winners" target="_blank">nominated for ENnie awards</a>, including the <a href="/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/wrathOfTheRighteous"><em>Wrath of the Righteous Adventure Card Game Base Set</em></a>.

              <p>On to <a href="/products/btpy9k5m"><em>Goblins Burn!</em></a> Three new goblin characters appear in this deck. Mogmurch earned his title of arsonist through his love of bombs and other thrown substances, burning a wide swath through his enemies. Poog, warcaster of the Licktoad tribe, goes everywhere with his trusty toad, Flybreath, and his prior pet, Dogfinder, calling on the blessings of Zarongel to see him through tough spots. And Zibini tells fortunes for a living, looking into her trusty crystal ball for what is to come. Be careful not to rouse her to anger, for her piercing gaze gives a headache to even the toughest goblins.</p> 
              <div class="blurbCenter">

              </div> 
              <p>The characters in <a href="/products/btpy9k5m"><em>Goblins Burn!</em></a> largely rely on spells to seize the day. One such spell, Burning Snot, really captures the essence of goblin spellcasting: take a deep breath and let it fly! Another awesome spell, Oozikinesis, allows the caster to cover anything in slime. Boon or bane, the goo gets them all!</p> 
              <div class="blurbCenter">
               <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6818-BurningSnot.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6818-BurningSnot_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6818-Oozikinesis.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6818-Oozikinesis_180.jpeg"></a>
              </div> 
              <p>Of course, spells aren't going to solve every problem. For those times the characters just cannot get out of the way, there are pot helms and horn armor to save their hides. These prime examples of goblin ingenuity and dumpster diving are made from only the finest junk—the helmet even doubles as a stewpot! </p>

              </div> 
              <p>There are also plenty of new items to capture the goblin spirit. For those in need of a bit of extra assistance, the Skill Slug is a tasty treat that really helps out. And as with <a href="/products/btpy9jcw"><em>Goblins Fight!</em></a>, each goblin has a frog ally.</p>

           <p itemprop="description">Good afternoon, Pathfinders! I just got back from northern Idaho, where I went to help clean out my childhood home. Sorting through the stuff brought the memories flooding back—wrapping paper from my childhood, the hand brace my grandfather wore, books I put in storage when I moved to England. The town doesn't look the same with the open fields of my youth replaced by housing developments. It was a relaxing visit, for being lots of physical labor, but now I'm back in Redmond and turning my focus to more Gen Con prep, getting things ready so I may travel to PaizoCon UK, and keeping things moving on getting support out to other conventions.</p>

              <h2>Gen Con Countdown—22 Days!</h2> 
              <p>Don't be left hanging in Indianapolis without something to do. Gen Con Badges are still available, as are tickets to the hottest events around—Pathfinder Society events in the Sagamore Ballroom. You still have a chance to get tickets to <a href="https://www.gencon.com/events/97556" target="_blank"><em>Serpent's Ire</em></a>, our Thursday night Special or <a href="https://www.gencon.com/events/97558" target="_blank"><em>Through Maelstrom Rift</em></a>. Quick! Make sure you have a ticket to these special events.</p> 
              <p>In addition to the Special Events, scenarios like <em>The Twisted Circle</em>, the <em>Faithless and Forgotten</em> series, or the evergreen scenarios <em>The Confirmation</em>, <em>The Wounded Wisp</em>, and <em>The Consortium Compact</em> are so popular they sold out, so we are working with Gen Con to add tables of each to our offerings. Net result, more tickets of these high demand scenarios will soon be available on the <a href="http://gencon.com" target="_blank">Gen Con Website</a>. Buy now before they are all gone!</p>

              <h2>Syrinscape Shinies</h2> 
              <p>As a thank you to the Venture-Officers, 4-star and 5-star GMs, Ben Loomes of <a href="http://syrinscape.com" target="_blank">Syrinscape</a> is gifting them with a year pass to its awesome service! For those unfamiliar with Syrinscape, it is an application that brings background sounds to the gaming table, adding depth and ambiance to your gaming experience. There are sounds for many for most situations—battles, towns, forests and waterfront—or use the sound creator to make your own. If you are a VO or 4/5 star GM, you will receive an email in the next day with directions how to activate your free account (to ensure you receive this message, double-check that you've enabled Paizo to send you emails on behalf of partner companies on your <a href="https://paizo.com/paizo/account">My Account page</a>). Anyone else wishing to add Syrinscape to their games may visit <a href="https://syrinscape.com/about-syrinscape/">their website</a> and try it for free.</p> 
              <h2>New 5-Star GMs</h2> 
              <p>Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild Game Masters are busy people, running hundreds of games a month and sharing their skills with our Pathfinder Society communities. It is my pleasure to recognize our newest 5* GMs, who ran over 150 games, including ten specials, and underwent the pressure of having a Venture-Captain observe their tables. This equates to over 750 hours of game time, not including preparation. Thank you very much for all the time you spent furthering our hobby.</p> 
              <p>Our newest five stars:</p> 
              <ul>
               <li>Bill Baldwin</li> 
               <li>Adam Dane</li> 
               <li>Josh Lovelace</li> 
               <li>Dawn Reed</li> 
               <li>Michael Tracey</li> 
               <li>Ben Wilkins</li> 
               <li>Kevin Willis</li>
              </ul> 
              <p>Finally, I would turn your thoughts to a more somber nature. In the aftermath of some of this weekends occurrences, please take a moment to reach out others in our community. Say hi! Shake hands! Enjoy our collective love of a game (or games, as many of use enjoy a variety of systems and genres). Take refuge and solace in our Society. For those I've met, be well! For those I haven't, stay safe. Your all friends I haven't met yet, and I want the chance to do so!</p> 
              <p>Until next time—Explore, Report, Cooperate!</p>

              <p>Incidentally, the set has officially moved to a NOVEMBER release. I am told by reliable sources that it is unlikely to slip further.</p> 
              <p>The theme of <a href="/products/btpy9kcu"><em>Deadly Foes</em></a> is high-utility monsters, humanoids, and heroes, and the feeling in the room as each of the painted figures was that this may be one of our best and most useful sets yet.</p> 
              <p>This week I'd like to show off three figures from the set: Hobgoblins all!</p>

              <p>Up first is the Hobgoblin Archer, a nice rank-and-file ranged weapon attacker. Simple. Effective. Deadly. The Hobgoblin Archer is a Medium, common figure.</p>

              <p>This guy is the bomb. The Hobgoblin Alchemist is a Medium, common figure.</p>

              </div> 
              <p>Last up this week is the Hobgoblin Cleric, another Medium, common figure.</p> 
              <p>All three hobgoblins were inspired by art from the <a href="/products/btpy9926"><em>Pathfinder RPG Monster Codex</em></a>, which also has relevant game statistics.</p> 
              <p>Lots more to show off in the coming weeks!</p>

              <p>Steven D. Russell, owner of <a href="/companies/ritePublishing">Rite Publishing</a>, was one of the first third-party publishers to give his support for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, but his impact goes well beyond the hundreds of products he helped usher into creation for gamers everywhere. Many of Paizo's freelancers got their start with Rite Publishing, and more than a few of us that work at Paizo also had the pleasure of working with him. Friend, advisor, mentor, author, designer—he wore all of these titles proudly. But none were as proudly worn as "gamer."</p> 
              <p>He was One of Us, and his influence and passion for the hobby will be missed.</p> 
              <p>A <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/2d5qnes" target="_blank">memorial fund</a> has been set up by his family for those wishing to donate.</p>

              <p itemprop="description">In just a few weeks, <a href="/products/btpy9n5a"><em>Pathfinder RPG Horror Adventures</em></a> will be launching at Gen Con 2016 and landing on store shelves! And while the GM is the one who sets a lot of the atmosphere in a horror game, each player and character contributes to the ambience—what better way to do that than to partake in horror-themed character options? In this blog, I'll give you all a preview of the character options within this book.</p> 
              <p>To start, let's look at one of the most mysterious and anticipated sections: the corruptions! Corruptions grant your character new powers, but they also stain your character with drawbacks and risk your character losing control to the darkness within. Each corruption comes with a catalyst, which describes how you might acquire, progress, and remove the main source of corruption, as well as a number of manifestations that each grant you a gift and an associated stain. There's also variants for useful corruptions, where you can ignore the stains, and vile corruptions, where you have no control over the manifestations but can ignore the gifts to help you fight off the corruption's influence. The 11 corruptions are as follows: Accursed grants you powers of curses and revenge like a hag or a fey. Deep one grants you aquatic abilities and other benefits associated with deep ones. Ghoul grants claws, stench, paralysis, and other powers related to ghouls and ghasts. Hellbound grants diabolical abilities like horns and the ability to summon devils. Hive is related to a new subtype of aberration created by a depraved annunaki; while normally hive larvae gestate in your body for sustenance and then kill you, a hive corrupted character has survived a rare metabolic symbiosis, gaining hive-related powers instead like a hive mind or acid blood. Lich grants you powers related to a failed attempt at lichdom, including necromantic mastery and a corpselike countenance. Lycanthropy grants you the ability to shift form into an animal or hybrid as well as other lycanthropic powers. Possessed grants you benefits from a second mind or soul within your body, such as letting your possessing spirit give you another shot against Will saves. Promethean comes about when you replace your body parts with construct parts, and it grants various construct-related abilities, particularly resistances and immunities. Shadowbound fills you with darkness and empties your life of joy, granting darkness and fear abilities. Finally, vampirism grants vampire abilities like fangs and summoning a rat swarm.</p>

              </div> 
              <p>Unlike many other books, there's actually a brief section on new race rules with some cool variant abilities that work well in a horror campaign. One fun example is the halfling ability creepy doll, which lets you use freeze like a gargoyle in order to appear to be a creepy-looking doll instead of a creature, and lets you Intimidate larger humanoids without a penalty due to your size.</p>

              </div> 
              <p>There's plenty of horrific archetypes and class options as well! For instance, the blood alchemist uses sentient lives to fuel her alchemy and can create alchemical circles like an occultist in order to apply formulas to an area instead of himself. The barbarian gains new rage powers including cult totem and daemon totem. The cleric elder mythos cultist archetype is a cleric who uses Charisma instead of Wisdom and is rather insane. Devolutionist druids devolve animals and humanoids into feral ancestors (including their animal companion, a devolved humanoid). Hexenhammer inquisitors mix blasphemous dark arts with their faith and must balance these transgressions with penance. Cult hunter investigators seek out horrific cults like your typical Lovecraft investigators. Kineticists gain the elemental whispers wild talents, which allow them to make friends with a voice in their head and even manifest it. Mediums can contact vile legendary spirits like the heretic, which replaces the hierophant and helps you infiltrate a good religion and corrupt it to evil. Hate-monger mesmerists can sow xenophobic hatred while applying touch treatment without the touched creature realizing it. Talisman crafter occultists can create talismans holding their spells that others can activate. Soul sentinel paladins can help with confusion and corruptions with their mercies and become immune to hexes and curses. Witch killer slayers are experts in hunting and killing arcane spellcasters, including an ability called "burn the witch". Necrologists are evil spiritualists that house vile undead within them, rather than phantoms. Hangman vigilantes are whip and noose experts. Tatterdemalion witches command fabric and thread and can stitch a creature's eyes or mouth shut. Finally, hallowed necromancer wizards use their necromancy to destroy undead, rather than create them.</p> 
              <p><a href="/products/btpy9n5a"><em>Horror Adventures</em></a> also has a variety of fun and horrifying feats, as well as feats to fight against the encroaching darkness. For instance, Absorb Spirit lets you temporarily house a rejuvenating spirit within you to prevent it from returning for a time, and Disconcerting Knowledge lets you demoralize a foe with Knowledge checks to identify its weaknesses. There's also plenty of monster feats (including one where a shapeshifter's form change involves ripping out of its old body in a gruesome fashion), a small assortment of story feats (like Twisted Love, where a horrible creature is in love with you), and even four new styles: Brute Style lets you victimize prone opponents like a rampaging kaiju, Deadhand Style allows you to manipulate fear and eventually inflict negative levels with your unarmed strikes for ki, Kyton Style lets you use a spiked chain as a monk weapon and eventually as a shield as well as a weapon, and Maddening Style lets you strike at a foe's sanity and eventually obliterate your fallen foes as <i>disintegrate</i>.</p> 
              <p>There are dark spells from foul tomes as well as righteous incantations to defeat them. The <i>death clutch</i> spell causes someone's heart to leap out into your hand while <i>damnation</i> deals damage to nearby creatures in proportion to their most powerful evil spell or spell effect. <i>Vile dog transformation</i> transforms dogs into horrific servitors, and they dissolve into a stinking pile of gore and bones at the end of the spell (if the dog trusts you, it takes a -4 penalty on its save to avoid being transformed), while <i>holy javelin</i> impales an evil creature, dealing ongoing damage and weakening them.</p> 
              <p>When it comes to magic items, there are a variety of horrific items, like a withered heart you can squeeze to damage your foes, an altar that lets you <i>animated dead</i> without expending onyx, gloves that give you mouths on your hands, ad a mantle of darkness that creates <i>deeper darkness</i> when you take a total defense. There's also holy items like a holy symbol that dazzles your foes when you channel or use it as a divine focus, a holy symbol that lets you calm down creatures by healing them with your channel, and a monocle that helps protect you from reading something that harm you (or your sanity!). There's also cursed items like the needful doll that demands attention lest it give you nightmares, as well as artifacts like the <i>dark grimoire</i>, which lets anyone cast any spell by studying it for 1 hour per spell level (you even ignore material component costs by sacrificing humanoid creatures—how convenient!).</p> 
              <p>And that's just a sampling of the goodies in store for you. Stay tuned next week when we'll be focusing on some of the cool GM tools and advice in the book!</p>

              <p>The cast of characters include two faces familiar to fans of the <a href="/pathfinder/modules/freeRPGDay"><em>We Be Goblins</em> Pathfinder Modules</a>: Reta, the female goblin commando with her stolen wedding veil; and Chuffy, the male goblin knifer covered in exploding pustules. Rounding out the triumvirate of fighting goblins is Ak, who comes to us from the fifth issue of Dynamite's <a href="/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics/goblins">Pathfinder Goblins!</a> comic. Ak is a male goblin runt with the most wretched expression ever worn by a goblin—this stems from his being average at fighting and incompetent with magic, compared to his compatriots. Fortunately, he is blessed by the goblin gods and can bring some well-timed assistance to the table.</p>

              </div> 
              <p>And what would the Licktoad goblins be without their tribe's namesake? Each goblin has a pet frog ally that helps cause mayhem in the most civilized setting. Chuffy carries Fat Frog, who is springy and sprongy like our favorite sneaky goblin. Spotol accompanies Reta, strengthening her Constitution. (Reta likes Spotol so much that she even gave him his own white veil!) Ak's favorite toad, Redbutt, confers Strength on his owner. Everything is easier to face with your pet at your side.</p>

Many of the new blessings feature cool stained-glass art, including Blessing of the Boss, Blessing of Lady Lastbreath, and Blessing of Bark Breaker. Of course, what would a goblin deck be without a blessing just for them? Blessing of the Gobs is all you would expect: helpful to goblins; painful and chaotic for others.</p>

              <p>The deck includes a good smattering of weapons, spells, armors, and items to help the goblins on their path to world domination. Well, maybe not enough to take over the world, or even the county, but enough to put them at the top of the goblin heap. And in case they get hungry on the way, we offer up some pickles!</p>

              <h2>Necessary Headgear</h2> 
              <p>At the PaizoCon banquet, I had the pleasure of modeling a knitted cap with the Year of the Stolen Storm logo. Lead Editor Extraordinaire Judy Bauer developed the pattern and knitted me a cap. An awesome gift from Judy, as my knitting skills don't extend past holding the needles and looking at the yarn. It is our pleasure to share the pattern with you. Please, if you do make one, remember to give creative credit to Judy!</p>

As an incentive for getting up early, anyone attending the first session of Pathfinder Society game every day (8:00 AM on Thursday/Friday/Saturday and 9:00 AM Sunday) will get an extra token to use at the prize table. Prizes this year include gift certificates to paizo.com, hardcover rulebooks, Map Packs, boons, and a few surprises.</p>

              <h2>Upcoming Pathfinder Society Pawn Set</h2> 
              <p>The <a href="/products/btpy9l30"><em>Pathfinder Society Pawns Collection</em></a> releases at Gen Con and includes art for many of the character archetypes for the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game Class Decks, as well as frequently occurring monsters in the Roleplaying Guild scenarios. A few of the pawns are for NPCs and monsters that haven't had art before.</p>

              </div> 
              <p>My favorite pawn is Raheli, the samsaran witch from the Adventure Card Game <em>Witch Deck</em>. With her flowing gowns and blue skin, she presents an otherworldly creature with awesome power. Go team witch!</p> 
              <div class="blurbCenter">
               <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderPawns/PZO1020-Angban.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderPawns/PZO1020-Angban_360.jpeg"></a>

              </div> 
              <p>Tanis' favorite is Angban, from the upcoming <em>Gunslinger Deck</em>. In her words, "He's dope. He is a portable turret and the ultimate expression of dwarves artifice."</p> 
              <div class="blurbCenter">
               <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderPawns/PZO1020-Valis.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderPawns/PZO1020-Valis_180.jpeg"></a>
               <br> <i>Illustration by Dion Harris</i>
              </div> 
              <p>Linda's favorite is Valais Durant, a memorable character from two different Pathfinder Society scenarios. I don't want to spoil anything, but her personality is as eclectic as her appearance. She's one of my all-time favorite NPCs, and with the new art on this pawn, she's sure to make a memorable entrance.</p> 
              <p>What pawn do you want to see most?</p> 
              <p>Until next time—Explore, Report, Cooperate!</p>
