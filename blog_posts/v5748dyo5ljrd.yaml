  ><em>Bestiary 6</em></a> post (the book officially released yesterday, so I can't\
  \ really call it a preview post!), I want to build upon last week's post, where\
  \ I talked a bit about monsters from mythological sources. In this case, since these\
  \ creatures aren't protected by copyright law and aren't the intellectual property\
  \ of content creators, the field is wide open—we can create specific creatures based\
  \ on these things in the same way we can stat up things like donkeys and rats. But\
  \ there's another category of inspiration that we often draw upon that's a bit trickier—\
  literary sources.</p> \n    <p>In this case, we've either opted for simply taking\
  \ inspiration for a monster and making up something entirely new, but that's not\
  \ exactly what I want to highlight here. When we look at older stories that are\
  \ now in the public domain, there are a huge number of interesting creatures we\
  \ can \"import\" into Pathfinder. We've been doing this in every Bestiary, from\
  \ the first one (which has H. G. Wells's morlocks and Lovecraft's shoggoths for\
  \ example) on. That doesn't change in <em>Bestiary 6</em>.</p> \n    <p>Of course,\
  \ since I was the one picking the monsters, it should come as no surprise that my\
  \ favorite author, Lovecraft, has some strong representation here. In some cases,\
  \ the monsters picked up from his stories are specific creatures he took time to\
  \ describe and explore (such as the yaddithian and the Great Old Ones). In other\
  \ cases, they're creatures he wrote entire stories about but never really named,\
  \ so I came up with specific names for them (the Leng hound, from his short story\
  \ \"The Hound\", and the unrisen, the lively awful remnants from \"The Case of Charles\
  \ Dexter Ward\"). And in one case, they were just name drops with only a few words\
  \ of tantalizing description—the urhag is a throwaway reference in \"The Dream Quest\
  \ of Unknown Kadath\" where they're described as things flying in the sky along\
  \ with bats in a creepy corner of the Dreamlands. In this case, other than \"they\
  \ fly\" we were able to create an entirely new monster to provide context for the\
  \ creature.</p> \n    <p>But Lovecraft wasn't my only source of literary inspiration.\
  \ Like the urhag, the whisperer is never mentioned by name in the story that inspired\
  \ it, but those who have read Algernon Blackwood's \"The Willows\" (one of my all-time\
  \ favorite stories) will recognize its themes and the weird wounds its touch causes\
  \ in flesh, I hope. The other, the horla, is the opposite—a creature that not only\
  \ heavily features in Guy de Maupassant's story, but gives that story its name:\
  \ \"The Horla.\" The fact that the horla is invisible in the story gave us some\
  \ leeway in creating its appearance for those who insist on using methods like see\
  \ <i>invisibility</i> to peer into the unknown, but its creepy abilities to feed\
  \ on slumbering victims and secretly drive them to murder and insanity are right\
  \ out of the pages of the tale. I've actually been trying to get the horla into\
  \ print as far back as <em>Bestiary 2</em>, so I'm glad the critter finally gets\
  \ to see the light of day!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\
