  \ and Master Abilities</b></em><br> Hello everyone, I am Tineke Bolleman (she/her)\
  \ and I wrote the familiars and the Menagerie for Grand Bazaar. I love all kinds\
  \ of animals, so getting to write a shop that puts the animals’ welfare first was\
  \ great for me. And making new familiars so we all have new friends to take with\
  \ us on adventures was amazing. Other than writing for Grand Bazaar, I do occasionally\
  \ write for other Paizo lines. I volunteer for the Organized Play program and I’\
  ve been a tabletop gamer for many years. You can follow me on twitter <a href=\"\
  https://twitter.com/DireOtterGames\" target=\"_blank\">@direottergames</a> for weird\
  \ game posts, geeking out about animals, and the occasional cat picture.</p> \n\

  \ Toys, Absalom Ads</b></em><br> Hi everyone! My name is Jessica and I’m a freelance\
  \ author and Starfinder Line Developer for the Starfinder Society. I’ve contributed\
  \ to over 30 projects for Paizo, including <em>Secrets of Magic</em>, <em>Galaxy\
  \ Exploration Manual</em>, <em>Tech Revolution</em>, <em>Starfinder #39: The Gilded\
  \ Cage</em>, and <em>PFS #3-99: Fate in the Future</em>. My upcoming releases include\
  \ <em>Lost Omens Knights of Lastwall</em>, <em>Book of the Dead</em>, <em>Guns &amp;\
  \ Gears</em>, <em>SFS #4-09: Through Sea and Storm</em>, and <em>Galactic Magic</em>.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>For <em>Lost Omens: Grand Bazaar</em>, rather than write for myself,\
  \ I wrote for my children. I wrote the toy shop, Merrygleam, its quirky shopkeep\
  \ Ozi and her found family, and the toys and other goodies you’ll find inside. Additionally,\
  \ I wrote Absalom Ads, a ‘training-manual-by-magical-mail’ company led by an absurdly\
  \ over-the-top halfling. I hope Merrygleam, in particular, brings some joy to your\
  \ world.<br> All the best,<br> Jessica</p> \n      <br> \n      <h3>Dana Ebert</h3>\
  \ \n      <p><em><b>Material Changes</b></em><br> Hello! My name is Dana Ebert (she/her),\
  \ and it was my pleasure to write about Material Changes and its illustrious proprietor,\
  \ Iltara Clavela. This was my first contribution to Pathfinder, and I'm thrilled\
  \ to finally be able to share it with all of you—although I must give credit for\
  \ all the fabulous items available at the boutique to the extremely talented Jessica\
  \ Redekop!</p> \n      <p>I didn't set out at first to write a transgender story,\
  \ but the themes of transformation and revelation were so central to Iltara's character\
  \ that as I penned my first draft, it became the obvious choice. As a trans woman\
  \ myself, it was nerve-wracking to submit something that felt so personal, but I\
  \ received nothing but support and encouragement from the outstanding team at Paizo.\
  \ It is my sincere hope that Iltara's story will mean just as much to other people.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>In the end, the Grand Bazaar is a triumph of a book, and I'm proud\
  \ to have been part of it. If you want to know more about what I'm working on, the\
  \ best places to visit are my Twitter (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/MistressDanaRPG\"\

  \      <p><b><em>Kraken's Ink Tattoo, Tattoos, Worn Items</em></b><br> Hi all! I’\
  m Avi Kool, and I’m senior editor at Paizo. I had the pleasure of being co–edit\
  \ lead on this book with Patrick Hurley, as well as writing the Kraken’s Ink section\
  \ and a handful of worn items, including the tattoos. You can see my writing in\
  \ books such as <em>Bestiary 3</em> (Nosferatu) and <em>Alien Archive 4</em> (The\
  \ Seen), as well as in the upcoming <em>Pathfinder Dark Archive</em>. My NPC in\
  \ this book, Arhan, is meant to be a representation of my Sephardic ancestors and\
  \ their flight from imperial Spain, so this book is very near and dear to my heart.\
  \ I hope you all enjoy it.</p> \n      <br> \n      <h3>Dustin Knight</h3> \n  \

  \ and welcome to the Grand Bazaar! I'm afraid my friend Tattletail is out getting\
  \ more Anuli spice right now, but maybe I can help you. Who am I? Here, I'm known\
  \ for peddling adventuring gear like fake blood packs and smoked goggles. Having\
  \ the opportunity to write a character with a prosthesis like Tattletail means so\
  \ much to me. I helped look after my late grandmother for many years, and her strength\

  \ \n      <p><em><b>The Rune Room, Accessory Runes</b></em><br> A fan of Pathfinder\
  \ since the beginning, I have always enjoyed tinkering with the rules in my own\
  \ games. After joining the online Pathfinder communities, I knew that I wanted to\
  \ get more involved in producing game content. That journey started with becoming\
  \ a blogger at Know Direction, where I write my Groundbreaking blog (and sometimes\
  \ others) and write reviews of the big GenCon releases from Paizo. I had an absolute\
  \ blast writing Rakuskuk and the Rune Room. Working with the other writers made\
  \ it so easy to ground him in the lore of Golarion, Absalom, and the Grand Bazaar\
  \ itself. I am excited to see how his story grows. Accessory Runes are a wonderful\
  \ addition to the game that I am proud to have worked on. I cannot wait to see where\
  \ they go from here. When not working directly on new content, I am probably working\
  \ on my other passion project... the RPG Sage. I am a big fan of playing RPGs via\
  \ Discord and so I decided to write my own bot to help immerse myself and others\
  \ into our games! You can learn more about it and give it a test run on my Discord\

  \ OK, good... the truth is I mostly just can't wait for the magic armor and runes\
