  \ Path</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Friday, October 19, 2007</p> \n    <p>Since\
  \ we're getting dangerously close to starting actual work on <a href=\"/pathfinder\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder</i>'s</a> second Adventure Path, <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7zdb\"\
  >Curse of the Crimson Throne</a>, I figured it'd be a great time to reveal some\
  \ information about <i>Pathfinder</i>'s third Adventure Path. This one's still quite\
  \ early in the development stages, but nonetheless we've got a fair amount about\
  \ it nailed down. And it's those things I want to talk about in today's blog post.\
  \ </p> \n    <p><b>The Name:</b> The third Adventure Path is called \"Second Darkness.\"\
  \ Yes, that does imply that there was a First Darkness. Keen-eyed blog and messageboard\
  \ readers might be able to figure out what that First Darkness is talking about,\
  \ and rather than say here, I'm inclined to let people guess and talk for a bit.\
  \ </p> <b>The First Adventure:</b> I'll be writing the first adventure in Second\
  \ Darkness—and it's going to be called \"Shadow in the Sky.\" It'll be set in and\
  \ around Riddleport in northwest Varisia. None of the other adventures in the campaign\
  \ have names yet, but by the time we're in adventure #4, the campaign will have\
  \ moved from northwest Varisia into the vast network of caverns deep below the surface\
  \ world. When the campaign comes back up for air on the surface, it'll be somewhere\
  \ rather far away from Varisia. \n    <p></p> \n    <p><b>The Edition:</b> I can't\
  \ say yet if Second Darkness will use the 3.5 rules or the 4th edition rules, simply\
  \ because we haven't seen the 4th edition rules yet and have no way of knowing if\
  \ they'll do the job for what we've got planned for this campaign. The only thing\
  \ I can guarantee is that whatever edition of the rules we use for \"Shadow in the\
  \ Sky,\" we won't be switching editions halfway through the Adventure Path. </p>\
  \ \n    <p><b>Level Range:</b> Like Rise of the Runelords and Curse of the Crimson\
  \ Throne, Second Darkness starts your PCs out at first level. I'm not sure what\
  \ level they'll end up being, but chances are pretty good that, since Second Darkness\
  \ is a 6-part campaign, it'll be pretty similar in that regard to Pathfinder's first\
  \ two Adventure Paths. </p> \n    <p><b>The Plot:</b> I don't want to give away\
  \ too much about the plot of Second Darkness, but I can say this: readers of <i>Pathfinder</i>\
  \ and <a href=\"http://paizo.com/gameMastery/modules\">GameMastery Modules</a> have\
  \ no doubt noticed the absence of one of the more iconic RPG bad guys. That's because\
  \ we were saving them for this Adventure Path. That's right: Second Darkness reveals\
  \ the role of the drow on (and under!) Golarion. </p> \n    <p><b>Drow of Golarion:</b>\
  \ Drow are certainly a hot topic among fans of the game. A lot of people actively\
  \ hate them for various reasons, it seems, but nonetheless, every time a drow ended\
  \ up on the cover of a magazine, that magazine sold incredibly well. More to the\
  \ point, drow have been (and remain) one of my favorite villains for the game. There's\
  \ just something so delightfully warped about elves who live in non-elven areas\
  \ deep underground, who worship demons, who have a sadistic matriarchal society,\
  \ and who have all sorts of creepy magic items and tricks up their sleeves. The\
  \ old D&amp;D adventure \"Queen of the Spiders\" remains my favorite D&amp;D adventure\
  \ of all time in large part due to the drow, who were of course first introduced\
  \ in that series as an evil mastermind race of bad guys. Eclavdra, Erelhei-Cinlu,\
  \ tentacle rods, death lances, the Elder Elemental Eye, temples that were actually\
  \ called fanes, and the demons the drow trafficked with are where I'll be going\
  \ for inspiration for Second Darkness. Don't expect any angst-ridden heroic loner\
  \ drow in Second Darkness—these drow will be villains through and through. We've\
  \ also got some new angles for drow in Golarion as well, something that I'm not\
  \ allowed to reveal quite yet, but it <i>does</i> have something to do with where\
  \ drow come from. </p> \n    <p><b>Other Elements: </b> Of course, the drow aren't\
  \ going to be the only villains in Second Darkness. You can expect one or more of\
  \ the following creatures to have important roles in the campaign as well: dragons,\
  \ derro, giant arachnids and insects, demons, tieflings, and maybe even some aboleths.\
  \ And as you might be able to tell from the first adventure's title… not all of\
  \ the monsters will be coming up from below. The skies above Golarion spawn dangers\
  \ of their own that are more than a match for anything the caves below can disgorge\
  \ up into the world!</p> \n    <p>James Jacobs <br>Editor-in-Chief, <i>Pathfinder</i></p>\
