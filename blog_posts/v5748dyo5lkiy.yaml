  \   </div> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Happy Friday, Pathfinders! We're now\
  \ well on our way through our exploration of the forthcoming <a href=\"/products/btpy9y9m?Pathfinder-Battles-Jungle-of-Despair\"\
  ><em>Jungle of Despair</em></a> miniatures set from WizKids, due out in May. This\
  \ week, I set aside my instinctive reaction to snakes and spiders and show off some\
  \ of the figures in the set most likely to make your players' skin crawl.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Continuing the set's theme of snakes and serpentfolk, we begin with the\
  \ metal cobra, a Small figure, this ophidian foe works both as a mechanical guardian\
  \ left in otherwise abandoned tombs and ruins to protect the treasures within, or\
  \ a more natural snake encountered in just about any environment (especially for\
  \ GMs willing to repaint the minis). Released at the common rarity, most collectors\
  \ will end up with a handful of them in their collection, giving them even more\
  \ versatility to be used as a lone animal companion or an overwhelming swarm.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180302-MetalCobra.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180302-MetalCobra_120.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>The metal cobra isn't the only creepy construct in the\
  \ set, however. Check out the apparatus of the octopus, a magic item from <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9toq?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Aquatic-Adventures\"><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Campaign Setting: Aquatic Adventures</em></a>. Capable of carrying two riders,\
  \ this piece of dungeon dressing could easily serve as both treasure in a jungle\
  \ grotto or as a means of conveyance along the ocean floor to an isolated jungle\
  \ island. The figure is 60mm tall, which makes it roughly 11 feet tall at scale,\
  \ making it a formidable presence on the table.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180302-ApparatusOfOctopus_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>No trip to the jungle is complete without bugs, and not\
  \ just any bugs. Giant bugs! Huge bugs! Bugs the size of people! THEM! We could\
  \ make a dozen sets of nothing but giant bugs and still have species and sizes we\
  \ never covered, so we have to pick our favorites. <em>Jungle of Despair</em> features\
  \ the giant ant, a common figure, that can stand in for any number of Medium giant\
  \ insects. Druids with the vermin familiar class feature from <em>Pathfinder RPG\
  \ Ultimate Magic</em> can have a Medium giant ant companion at 4th level, making\
  \ this miniature useful for a handful of players as well as GMs.</p> \n    <div\

  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180302-GiantAnt_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>The Material Plane isn't the only plane full of creepers\
  \ and crawlers. The Abyss prides itself on its myriad gross inhabitants, not the\
  \ least of which are the primeval qlippoth, who hope to eradicate all mortals from\
  \ existence, thereby ending sin and with it the demons from whom they could reclaim\
  \ their stolen plane. <em>Jungle of Despair</em> features four qlippoth figures\
  \ (and a few daemons, of whom the qlippoth also aren't particularly fond), the first\
  \ of which is the thulgant qlippoth. This horrific, spider-like creature has tentacles\
  \ and scorpion stingers and an overwhelming hatred for demonkind. Lording over hives\
  \ of bound servitors in the depths of the Abyss, thulgants make great campaign villains,\
  \ and at CR 18, present a challenging capstone encounter for experienced adventuring\
  \ parties. The thulgant qlippoth is a Large rare figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Next week, we'll stare fully into the Abyss and see what\
  \ other qlippoth stare back. Strap in for a journey to the lower planes, as we face\
  \ off against five jungle fiends! Until then, roll high, and don't split the party!</p>\
