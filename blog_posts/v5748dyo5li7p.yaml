  \ itemprop=\"description\">Today I've got the final three figure previews for January's\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9er4\"><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a> set of prepainted\
  \ plastic <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder Battles</a>, and by a happy\
  \ coincidence, it's easy to use all three to create a mini-encounter set in the\
  \ hold of a ship! Two of these items are \"dungeon dressing,\" while the third is\
  \ an oft-requested character that I consider one of the strangest figures we've\
  \ done to date. Let's take a look!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a\
  \ href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20151106-Crate.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20151106-Crate_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>First up this week is the Crate. It's a crate. WizKids\
  \ has added a nice ink wash to pull out the wooden details here, and if you can\
  \ somehow figure out how to get a bunch of them (I suspect—but do not know for sure—\
  that there will be as many as 2 per case), you'll be able to create a cool warehouse\
  \ scene, or dress up a basement, a bandit lair, or just about any encounter with\
  \ some handy terrain. The Crate fits nicely on the Wagon and Cart figures that also\
  \ fill out the \"dungeon dressing\" offerings in <a href=\"/products/btpy9er4\"\
  ><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a>, so while it's a simple \"wooden\" box, there's\
  \ a lot of versatility here that I suspect will make the Crate a popular piece.</p>\

  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Next we have the Barrel. It's a barrel. Very much in\
  \ place at an inn or a tavern, the Barrel is another versatile piece of dungeon\
  \ dressing I've been trying to get into a set since the idea of terrain pieces first\
  \ crossed our mind about a year ago. Is it filled with booze? Explosives? I dunno!\
  \ That's up to you!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20151106-Ranzak.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20151106-Ranzak_360.jpeg\"></a>\n \
  \   </div> \n    <p>Last up this week is the perfect accompaniment for crates and\
  \ barrels in a ship's cargo hold, Ranzak, the goblin pirate! First introduced as\
  \ a <a href=\"/products/btpy96ie\">playable goblin character</a> in the <a href=\"\
  /pathfinder/adventureCardGame\">Pathfinder Adventure Card Game</a>, Ranzak is a\
  \ delightfully psychotic little wretch who has been demanding representation in\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder Battles</a> almost since the day he\
  \ was created. Seriously. Dude has been carving his name into my office door with\
  \ his hook hand. He's very ill-behaved. This, of course, makes him a great addition\
  \ to a Pathfinder campaign, whether at the head of a group of goblin scallywags,\
  \ or as a unique \"oddball\" crewmember for the party's next ocean voyage. Ranzak\
  \ is a Small, rare figure.</p> \n    <p>And that's it for <a href=\"/products/btpy9er4\"\
  ><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a> previews! We've significantly revised (for the\
  \ better) the bar case incentive for the set, and between now and next Friday I\
  \ hope to get new shots to show off the increased size and versatility of the set.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Until then, I remain...</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p>\
