  \     </div>\n     <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\">No fewer than\
  \ three songs echoed through Hide and the deer kami as they strolled past the vendors\
  \ lining the streets of Kasai. Unseen drums shook the air, the bass felt as much\
  \ as it was heard, while flutes and shamisen competed for the rest of the matsuri’\
  s soundscape. Hide’s stomach gurgled, but the festival food they passed—fried chicken,\
  \ grilled octopus, and omelet-wrapped sausage—were ill-suited to either of their\
  \ diets.</p>\n      <p><em>Ask her if she has one in green.</em> The deer kami’\
  s words appeared in Hide’s mind, as if revealed by receding mist. Similarly, Hide\
  \ realized they were standing in front of a stall festooned with colorful strings\
  \ of flowers and staffed by a woman in gray robes.</p>\n      <p><em>Nn. I will,\
  \ Mister Kami.</em></p>\n      <p><em>Because it’s my favorite color.</em></p>\n\
  \      <p><em>Nn. I understand.</em> Hide turned to the flower vendor’s stall. <em>If\
  \ you’d just allow me to—</em></p>\n      <p>“Taking your pet for a walk?” murmured\
  \ the vendor from beneath her mask.</p>\n      <p>“No, he’s not a pet, he’s...”\
  \ Hide trailed off as he realized the woman’s eyes were not on him. She snorted\
  \ and turned her attention to Hide.</p>\n      <p>“Apologies, sir. I was speaking\
  \ to your companion.”</p>\n      <p>“<em>I</em> was the pet?” Hide asked, barely\
  \ holding his incredulity at bay.</p>\n      <p>“What can I do for you, sir?” the\
  \ woman continued, without missing a beat.</p>\n      <p>“Do you have any green\
  \ flowers?”</p>\n      <p>“Not exactly, sir, but I could apply a treatment to some\
  \ yellow ones. The string won’t stay fresh as long, but—”</p>\n      <p>The kami\
  \ pranced excitedly, hooves tippy-tappying in the dirt road. This time, the words\
  \ he was trying to convey were completely unintelligible to Hide, though the sentiment\
  \ was clear.</p>\n      <p>“I think we’ll take one.”</p>\n      <p>“Wonderful. I’\
  ll just—”</p>\n      <p>Whatever the vendor said next was lost as the kami’s words\
  \ washed over Hide. <em>Tell her she doesn’t have to wrap it.</em> The vendor cocked\
  \ her head slightly and paused gathering her supplies, waiting for her customers’\
  \ mental conversation to complete.</p>\n      <p>“He wants to wear it?” the vendor\
  \ asked.</p>\n      <p>“He wants to wear it,” said Hide. “How did you know?”</p>\n\
  \      <p>“Kami often have particular tastes,” replied the vendor. She tugged her\
  \ mask up a little higher, then laid an ornament of yellow flowers across her table\
  \ and started waving a wand over it. Blue and green sparks cascaded from her hand,\
  \ so quickly and brightly that Hide jerked his head away and blinked rapidly. If\
  \ the sparks caused the masked vendor any discomfort, she didn’t show it. Nor did\
  \ she show the gold coins that appeared in her hand in a telltale subtle shimmer\
  \ of transportation magic; they’d disappeared from Hide’s purse while he was blinded\
  \ by the sparks.</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/f993fc92-7066-4fce-86b0-0aa509944306/PZO13001_MinkaiOpener_2000x1333.png\"\

  \ by Sammy Khalid</p>\n      </div>\n      <br>\n      <p>“May I ask,” Hide began,\
  \ “Why are you dressed in gray while your stall is so colorful?”</p>\n      <p>The\
  \ vendor’s eyes sank slightly, and Hide realized the woman had been smiling under\
  \ her mask until now.</p>\n      <p>“Life everywhere in Minkai under the Jade Regent\
  \ was... challenging. We all did what we had to do. And we don’t know what we’ll\
  \ have to do next.”</p>\n      <p>Hide was suddenly very aware of the gold chains\
  \ adorning his robes. His purse felt wrong. The pause lingered too long.</p>\n \
  \     <p>“I didn’t hurt anyone. I just... relocated things and information. Hence\
  \ the dark gray,” the woman continued.</p>\n      <p>“I understand. I’ve done similar\
  \ things. I’m sorry for asking so indelicately.”</p>\n      <p>“May I ask you a\
  \ question, sir?” the vendor inquired.</p>\n      <p>“Of course.”</p>\n      <p>“\
  Why are you a kami’s traveling companion?”</p>\n      <p>“This place was all forest\
  \ once, you know?” said Hide. “That’s a silly statement. I apologize. Obviously,\
  \ this was once forest. Everything was forest at one time. I mean to say that my\
  \ friend remembered this place as it was and wanted to return—to see what we humans\
  \ had done with the space and the trees.”</p>\n      <p>A smiling crinkle returned\
  \ to the woman’s eyes. “How nice. I hope he’s not too put off by what he sees.”\
  \ She paused and shifted her attention to the deer kami. It took a moment for Hide\
  \ to realize the kami was mentally speaking with her once more.</p>\n      <p>“\
  That’s a very charitable view of humanity, Mister Kami. Thank you.” The merchant\
  \ said. She faced Hide again. “Now, it’s my turn to apologize. He pointed out that\
  \ you didn’t answer my question. Why do you follow the kami?”</p>\n      <p>“Ah.\
  \ You’re right. I didn’t,” Hide admitted. He looked to his companion somberly. “\
  It’s something of my calling. After I traded in my sword for a political office,\
  \ I found myself knowing too much to sleep soundly. I do not think the Empress will\
  \ return the kami’s lands to them, but that doesn’t mean that kami like Green Rush\
  \ here should have to stay confined to their forest.”</p>\n      <p>“So, you’re\
  \ a chaperone?” the vendor asked.</p>\n      <p>“Something like that. Perhaps more\
  \ of a bodyguard, truly.”</p>\n      <p>Green Rush turned his head towards Hide,\
  \ as the razor-sharp points of his antlers caught the light. <em>Truly?</em></p>\n\
  \      <p>“A bodyguard in the same sense that a professional fighter needs someone\
  \ to limit the danger to would-be aggressors,” Hide answered aloud.</p>\n      <p>“\
  I thought you said you put down your sword,” probed the vendor as she leaned over\
  \ her stall’s counter, holding the newly green flower string out for Green Rush.</p>\n\
  \      <p>“I don’t need to use a blade to defend, just as you don’t need to use\
  \ your hands to collect payment.”</p>\n      <p>The vendor’s eyes went wide, and\
  \ she froze as Green Rush’s deadly antlers surrounded her hands. “I—” she started.</p>\n\
  \      <p>“I’m not judging you.” Hide cut her off. “I told you I’ve done similar\
  \ things. I’m not even upset. You’re doing something nice for our kami guest, making\
  \ sure he has his favorite color. That’s more than most would do.” Hide lifted his\
  \ pouch slightly, checking its weight. “Yes, that seems like a fair trade. And it\
  \ will undoubtedly help you transition to a more... conventional vocation, yes?”\
  </p>\n      <p>“Yes. Of course, sir,” said the vendor, her relief reducing her voice\
  \ to a mere whisper. She finished tying the flower string to Green Rush’s antlers,\
  \ pushed herself upright, and regarded her customers once more. “Will that be all,\
  \ honored guests?”</p>\n      <p>“I think there’s just one more detail we need to\
  \ take care of.”</p>\n      <p>Beneath the vendor’s mask, a whimper started to form,\
  \ despite Hide’s calm smile.</p>\n      <p>“Could I get a receipt? I need one so\
  \ I can file a reimbursement with the Empress’ government.”</p>\n     </blockquote>\n\
