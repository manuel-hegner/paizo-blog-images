  \ the next set of <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder Battles</a> prepainted\
  \ plastic miniatures, releases next month! Over the last few months, I've been using\
  \ this space to preview new digital sculpts for the figures, and this week I've\
  \ got the final two miniatures for the set! The Paizo Warehouse Runelords tell me\
  \ that our shipment of packaged product from WizKids hits our office soon, so I\
  \ also hope to provide a few first-looks at actual production figures in the weeks\
  \ between now and the set's official release date in the middle of November.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Then we've got ANOTHER whole set that WizKids just announced this week\
  \ to cover in future previewsâ€”more on that at the bottom of this week's blog.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>But first, let's take a look at the last two figures from <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9kcu\"><em>Deadly Foes</em></a>!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20161014-ShadowGiant.jpg\"><img\
  \ src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20161014-ShadowGiant_360.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>Up first is the Shadow Giant, the final creature figure to\
  \ be revealed for <a href=\"/products/btpy9kcu\"><em>Deadly Foes</em></a>! This\
  \ guy has a fascinating Pathfinder origin. The Shadow Giant first appeared in the\
  \ illustration accompanying the religion chapter waaaaay back in the <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy82t7\"><em>Pathfinder Chronicles Gazetteer</em></a>, the first-ever\
  \ look at the world of Golarion as a whole (co-written by yours truly). It took\
  \ until <a href=\"/products/btpy8v2x\"><em>The Inner Sea Bestiary</em></a> to give\
  \ the Shadow Giant statistics. Keep an eye out for their upcoming appearance in\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9oge\"><em>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Bestiary 6</em></a>\
  \ next spring! The Shadow Giant is a Large, rare figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20161014-RopeTrick.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20161014-RopeTrick_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>The last figure of the entire set to preview is the Rope\
  \ Trick, a fun piece of dungeon dressing suggested by my friend Ross Williams, a\
  \ player in my weekly Pathfinder game (under GM Jason Bulmahn). During a particularly\
  \ rough patch in the campaign, we found ourselves frequently hiding out in the extra-dimensional\
  \ rope trick created by Ross's wizard, and it often became necessary to know where\
  \ exactly on the battlefield the rope trick was meant to be. Ross suggested a rope\
  \ trick miniature, and I thought it a sufficiently fun idea to add it to the set.\
  \ Opinions here at Paizo are somewhat divided as to the utility of this piece, but\
  \ I know I'll use it in my game, so it's in. As they say, absolute power corrupts\
  \ absolutely. Absolutely! The Rope Trick is a super-rare piece inserted once per\
  \ case in place of an uncommon figure. I hope you like it.</p> \n    <p>And that's\
  \ it for <a href=\"/products/btpy9kcu\"><em>Deadly Foes</em></a>, which I think\
  \ is one of our best and most useful sets yet!</p> \n    <p>The end of <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9kcu\"><em>Deadly Foes</em></a> previews comes just in time, as WizKids\
  \ this week announced the NEXT <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder Battles</a>\
  \ set, Crown of Fangs! Crown of Fangs contains 47 creature figures and a bunch of\
  \ dungeon dressing. My favorite element of the set is the case incentive, the Court\
  \ of the Crimson Throne, a full throneroom playset that contains thrones, a banquet\
  \ table, courtiers, and more. We took the idea from the <a href=\"/products/btpy9ehn\"\
  >bar incentive</a> in The Rusty Dragon Inn set and said \"how can we make this waaaay\
  \ cooler?\" I think you'll be pleased with the results.</p> \n    <p>But that's\
  \ getting way ahead of myself. There will be a lot more time to talk about Crown\
  \ of Fangs in future weeks!</p> \n    <p>Until then, I remain...</p> \n    <p>Erik\
