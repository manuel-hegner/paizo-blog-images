  \ border=\"0\" align=\"right\"></a> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>So a druid and her\
  \ animal companion walk into the forest. Wait, I did that bit last week. The druid\
  \ is one of those classes that is tough to nail down. The rules for the druid involve\
  \ a number of different subsystems, including animal companions and the rules for\
  \ changing shape. Not surprisingly, of all the parts of a druid, these two received\
  \ the biggest overhaul.</p> \n   <p>Let's start off by taking a look at wild shape.\
  \ The old rules were a bit disjointed, giving you additional uses almost sporadically\
  \ as you gained levels, while granting different types and sizes along the way.\
  \ The new system grants you the ability to wild shape one level earlier (4th, instead\
  \ of 5th) and gives you an additional usage every two levels after that (Lini is\
  \ wearing <i>druid vestments</i> which gives her an additional use). Just like before,\
  \ you can maintain a form for one hour per Druid level. Unlike the old system, which\
  \ gave you the exact stats of the animal, the new system is based off a number of\
  \ spells that grant a specific list of ability score bonuses. These spells also\
  \ grant some of the powers of your new form, depending on the spells level (just\
  \ as they did in the Beta playtest version of the rules). For example, at 8th level,\
  \ Lini can turn into any animal from size Diminutive to Huge, a Small or Medium\
  \ elemental creature, or a Small or Medium plant creature. If she were to change\
  \ her shape into a Large dire tiger, her Strength would jump to 12 and her Dex would\
  \ drop to 10. She would also gain a +4 natural armor bonus, a speed of 40 feet,\
  \ and the tiger's claw and bite attacks, as well as its ability to pounce, rake,\
  \ and grab. The big change here is that these alterations to her statistics are\
  \ now size bonuses, meaning that she can take advantage of spells like <i>bull’\
  s strength</i> and magic items to enhance her ability scores (magic items that continuously\
  \ function continue to do so while in wild shape, such as her <i>amulet of mighty\
  \ fists</i>). Add in <i>bull's strength</i> and Lini the dire tiger could make two\
  \ claw attacks at +10, dealing 2d4+4 each, and one bite attack at +9, dealing 2d6+3\
  \ with the opportunity to grapple anyone she hits. So while this ability allows\
  \ Lini to become a respectable melee threat, it does not allow her to ignore her\
  \ physical stats during creation if she wants to be good at combat.</p> \n   <p>The\
  \ Beta playtest rules for animal companions were very similar to their 3.5 counterparts,\
  \ which caused a number of issues. If you wanted to be a druid with a bear animal\
  \ companion, you had to wait until 4th level, and once you got past 7th level, you\
  \ really needed to trade in your loyal bear for a bigger, better bear companion.\
  \ We wanted druids to be able to form a meaningful bond with their companion from\
  \ first level, regardless of type, and to keep that companion up through the higher\
  \ levels of play. During the playtest, we posted up some alternate rules for animal\
  \ companions, which have made it into the final game with a few alterations. Druids\
  \ still have the option of taking a cleric domain in place of animal companion,\
  \ but those that choose a friend will be pleasantly surprised. Companions are now\
  \ based on a straightforward progression, gaining Hit Dice and other abilities as\
  \ the druid gains levels. Each animal type is a sort of template that is applied\
  \ to the base statistics shared by all animal companions. These templates define\
  \ the companions' ability scores, attacks, defenses, movement types, and special\
  \ abilities. At 4th or 7th level (depending upon the power of the companion), many\
  \ animal companions gain a large set of increases, usually based on size (although\
  \ druids who want a smaller pet now have the option of keeping it the same size).\
  \ Droogami, for example, started out with the following block of information.</p>\
  \ \n   <blockquote> \n    <p><b>Cat, Small (Cheetah Leopard)</b><br> <b>Starting\
  \ Statistics: Size</b> Small; <b>Speed</b> 50 ft.; <b>AC</b> +1 natural armor; <b>Attack</b>\
  \ bite (1d4 plus trip), 2 claws (1d2); <b>Ability Scores</b> Str 12, Dex 21, Con\
  \ 13, Int 2, Wis 12, Cha 6; <b>Special Qualities</b> low-light vision, scent.<br>\
  \ <b>4th-Level Advancement: Size</b> Medium; <b>Attack</b> bite (1d6 plus trip),\
  \ 2 claws (1d3); <b>Ability Scores</b> Str +4, Dex –2, Con +2; <b>Special Qualities</b>\
  \ sprint.</p> \n   </blockquote> \n   <p>Droogami's other statistics are derived\
  \ from a simple chart that tells you the number of Hit Dice, skill points, feats,\
  \ natural armor bonuses, and Strength and Dexterity bonuses. Droogami also receives\
  \ an ability score boost that can be placed anywhere (Dexterity in this case). All\
  \ of this is on top of the old druid animal companion abilities, such as share spells\
  \ and evasion.</p> \n   <p>Aside from these big changes, there have been a number\
  \ of smaller alterations to the some of the rules used in Lini's stat block. Resist\
  \ nature's lure, for example, now also applies to any effect that targets plants\
  \ or wood, such as <i>entangle</i> and <i>warp wood</i>. The spell <i>poison</i>\
  \ now works with the new poison rules (in this case, dealing 1d3 Con damage per\
  \ round for 6 rounds, or until a save is made). <i>Entangle</i> has been clarified\
  \ a bit, giving the entangled condition to those that fail their save, while those\
  \ that make it can move through the area, which is considered difficult terrain.\
  \ Of course, the spell still requires tall grass, weeds, or bushes. Since Hide and\
  \ Move Silently were combined into Stealth, the <i>boots of elvenkind</i> and <i>cloak\
  \ of elvenkind</i> became a bit redundant. To alleviate this, the boots now grant\
  \ a +5 bonus on Acrobatics checks.</p> \n   <p>I should also take a brief moment\
  \ to talk about the Fly skill (which has been controversial from the start). This\
  \ skill helps to adjudicate actions in the air, which were previously an all-or-nothing\
  \ affair based on your maneuverability. Now, just like walking, swimming, or climbing,\
  \ there is a set list of maneuvers you can perform without a skill check, and some,\
  \ more difficult flying maneuvers (such as hovering or turning 180 degrees) that\
  \ require a check. While this is a bit more complicated, it is far more dynamic,\
  \ allowing for sky chases, dramatic crashes, and my personal favorite, attempting\
  \ to force a dragon to land by shooting him down. This skill bonus is modified by\
  \ both your size and your maneuverability, which means that even large Hit Dice\
  \ creatures, such as dragons, do not necessarily receive high scores, while smaller\
  \ creatures, such as bats, are quite skilled.</p> \n   <p>Alright, we are out of\
  \ the forest now, and over half way done. Come back next week for a lesson on inner\
  \ peace and busting heads with Sajan, the iconic monk.</p> \n   <p>Jason Bulmahn<br>\
