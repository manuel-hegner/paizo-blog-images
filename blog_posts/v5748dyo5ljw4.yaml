  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">You might\
  \ have been hearing rumors here and there...rumblings of an agreement between Paizo\
  \ and the incredibly entertaining Glass Cannon podcast. Well today, we are proud\
  \ to confirm that the Glass Cannon Podcast is now an official Paizo podcast!</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/20170615-Image1.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/20170615-Image1_500.jpeg\"></a> \n     <p>Mike Kenway\
  \ and Troy Lavallee with the document to make it official!</p>\n    </div> \n  \
  \  <p>For those that don't know, the Glass Cannon Podcast is an actual-play RPG\
  \ podcast that has been playing the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/giantslayer\"\
  >Giantslayer Adventure Path</a>. We've been fans of the show since the beginning\
  \ and it was only a matter of time before we teamed up and made it official. Making\
  \ this announcement today is extra special because it also marks their two-year\
  \ anniversary.</p> \n    <p>GM Troy Lavallee serves as a ringmaster of sorts to\
  \ rest of the group. \"It was presumptuous from the start to imagine that anyone\
  \ would enjoy listening to five guys sit around improvising while playing a tabletop\
  \ role-playing game every week\" says Lavallee. Fellow cast members Joe O'Brien,\
  \ Skid Maher, Grant Berger, and Matthew Capodicasa all work perfectly together to\
  \ create a unique podcast experience.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n  \

  \    </div> \n    <p>To learn more about the Glass Cannon crew, their about page\
  \ can be found <a href=\"http://www.glasscannonpodcast.com/aboutus/\" target=\"\
  _blank\">here</a>. New episodes of their game go up every Tuesday at 12:01 AM Eastern,\
  \ while their other show, Cannon Fodder (a sort of Q&amp;A/recap show) goes up every\
  \ Thursday at 12:01 AM Eastern. You can subscribe on iTunes or head to their site\
  \ for the full archive of shows. For best results, we recommend starting with <a\
  \ href=\"http://www.glasscannonpodcast.com/podcast/\" target=\"_blank\">Episode\
  \ 1</a> so you can follow along with all of the adventures.</p> \n    <p>\"I'm so\
  \ excited to be officially partnering with Paizo - not only for the very selfish\
  \ reason that I'll get to keep spending time in their worlds, but also so that we\
  \ can all continue to tell weird and wonderful stories together.\" says Matthew\
  \ Capodicasa.</p> \n    <p>We couldn't agree more, welcome to the family!</p> \n\
