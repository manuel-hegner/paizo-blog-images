  >Obsidian <em>Pathfinder Adventures</em> Update</h2> \n     <p>Before we jump into\
  \ your regularly scheduled blog, we have the following message to relay from Obsidian:</p>\
  \ \n     <blockquote> \n      <p>We know many of you are eagerly awaiting the chance\
  \ to explore Sandpoint and defeat the Runelords, and we're sorry to keep you waiting\
  \ just a little bit longer: We're moving the launch day for <a href=\"https://pathfinder.obsidian.net/\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\"><em>Pathfinder Adventures</em></a> to April 26.</p> \n     \
  \ <p>The good news is why the game is being delayed: during beta testing over the\
  \ last couple of weeks the community has given us a ton of feedback on everything\
  \ from visual polish to card balance and general gameplay. We want to evaluate all\
  \ of the ideas and address as many as possible before launch, and that process is\
  \ going to take a little bit of time.</p> \n      <p>Ultimately, we hope you all\
  \ agree that the result will be a better <a href=\"https://pathfinder.obsidian.net/\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\"><em>Pathfinder Adventures</em></a>, just at a sliiiiightly later\
  \ date.</p> \n      <p>Stuart Roch<br> <i>Director of Publishing, Obsidian Entertainment</i></p>\

  >We're just laying down the final versions of the <em>Mummy's Mask</em> promo cards\
  \ this week, which reminds me that we have more promos to talk about! <a href=\"\
  \ /pathfinderbattles/iconicHeroes\">Pathfinder Battles: Iconic Heroes Set #6</a>\
  \ has just been released, complete with an extra miniature <i>and</i> an extra promo\
  \ card. (See? Don't say we never gave you nothin'.)</p> \n    <p>Here's a look at\
  \ the promo cards in <a href=\"/products/btpy9fyt\">Set #6</a>. As a reminder, these\
  \ cards have the Owner trait, meaning the character whose name is on the card can\
  \ treat it as a Basic card.</p> \n    <h2>Some Cards from Iconics that Already have\
  \ ACG Character Cards...</h2> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/WZK71783-SliverFlute.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/WZK71783-SliverFlute_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/WZK71783-ElvenScimitar.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/WZK71783-ElvenScimitar_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/WZK71783-Daji.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/WZK71783-Daji_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Daji's card could have been named \"Red Fox,\" but then I wouldn't\
  \ stop shouting \"I'm coming to join you, Elizabeth!\"</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>People\
  \ have been saying \"Where's Lem?\" since <a href=\"/products/btpy98sw\">Iconic\
  \ Heroes Set #1</a>. There's this thing where we could only get one small mini into\
  \ each set, and we wanted to make sure that Biter and... screw it, the important\
  \ thing is that he's finally here.</p> \n    <p>And he brought his flute! The Instrument\
  \ trait first appeared on Oloch's <a href=\" /paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lie0\">Orc War\
  \ Drum</a>, but has since migrated into <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/wrathOfTheRighteous\"\
  ><em>Wrath of the Righteous</em></a> and other decks. Basically, it means that you're\
  \ gonna add 1d4 to other people's checks in some wayâ€”in other words, it'll make\
  \ you a bit like a Bard. But if you're <i>already</i> a Bard, you get to add that\
  \ d4 to everything anyone does that turn. <i>Everything.</i> Lem + Flute = popular.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Our favorite emo magus gets a shiny bent scimitar. Since he's just as\
  \ concerned with spells as swords, Seltyiel can use it to pick up spells and then\
  \ fling them back later.</p> \n    <p>Feiya has two cards in this set, including\
  \ Daji the fox. Feiya's trick, both in the <a href=\"/products/btpy92zk\"><em>Skull\
  \ &amp; Shackles Character Add-On Deck</em></a> and the upcoming <a href=\"/products/btpy9icp\"\
  ><em>Witch Deck</em></a> revolves around recharging cards to reduce the difficulty\
  \ of checks. Daji's great for many a spellcaster due to the Intelligence and Wisdom\
  \ bumps, but when it's Feiya, suddenly she's reducing difficulty by 6 or 7 all the\
  \ time. Pretty dodgy, if you ask me.</p> \n    <h2>... And Cards from Iconics that\
  \ Don't have Character Cards Yet</h2> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>I swear there was some armor around here a minute ago.</i>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>We haven't released playable versions of Quinn the Investigator,\
  \ Hayato the Samurai, or Reiko the Ninja yet. But their <em>Iconic Heroes</em> cards\
  \ are useful even without their owners.</p> \n    <p>The investigator's main gimmick\
  \ is peering into dark places. Just as Holmes has his magnifying glass, Quinn has\
  \ his lamp. Anyone can use it to peek at cards and clear out barriers. When Quinn\
  \ shows up, he'll be doing that a lot.</p> \n    <p>Reiko's black ninja armor is\
  \ loaded with hidden weapons. Don't have a need for armor right now? <em>Voop</em>,\
  \ it's a Hand Crossbow. Or a Dragon Pistol. Or in Reiko's case, maybe it's a Kusarigama.\
  \ Just the kind of thing your shadowy figures would need in a pinch.</p> \n    <p>So\
  \ that's Set 6. We get asked a lot, \"Will there be more Iconic Heroes sets?\" WizKids\
  \ is still contemplating the answer to that, but we sure hope so.</p> \n    <h2>And\
  \ Speaking of Promos...</h2> \n    <p>This year's <a href=\"http://freerpgday.com\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Free RPG Day</a> is June 18, and we've got another goblin character\
  \ coming your way. We're not gonna say much about him for a little while, but here's\
  \ Tup the Terrible!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/Tup-Token-Back.jpg\"\
