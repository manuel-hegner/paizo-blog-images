  \ <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, July 19, 2011</p> \n   <p>Time slips by so quickly\
  \ during the summer months that it seems like a new rulebook is just around the\
  \ corner. As it turns out, <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8ies\"><i>Ultimate\
  \ Combat</i></a> is due to release in just a few weeks. From now until Gen Con,\
  \ we will be showing off some of the exciting new options for characters and GMs\
  \ alike that hide inside this blood-drenched tome.</p> \n   <p>To kick things off,\
  \ I can think of no better way than to take a look at the classes chapter of <i>Ultimate\
  \ Combat</i>. This book features one brand-new class, the gunslinger, as well as\
  \ two alternate classes, the ninja and the samurai. In addition, all of the classes\
  \ that focus on melee or ranged combat get a host of new archetypes in this book.\
  \ Take a look a this list.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <div align=\"right\"> \n  \

  \    </tbody>\n   </table>\n  </div> \n  <blockquote> \n   <blockquote> \n    <p><b>Alchemist</b>:\
  \ This section presents the beastmorph and ragechemist archetypes.<br> <b>Barbarian</b>:\
  \ This section includes the armored hulk, scarred rager, sea reaver, titan mauler,\
  \ true primitive, urban barbarian, and wild rager.<br> <b>Bard</b>: This section\

  \ sanctified rogue, and survivalist.<br> <b>Wizard</b>: This section includes the\
  \ arcane bomber, siege mage, and spellslinger.</p> \n   </blockquote> \n   <p>Of\
  \ course, some of these classes get other new rules as well, such as rage powers,\
  \ rogue talents, and the like. Some of these archetypes can make for some versatile\
  \ and powerful characters. I myself am playing with one of these archetypes in a\
  \ campaign being run by our illustrious publisher, Erik Mona. Take a look at the\
  \ Maneuver Master.</p> \n   <blockquote> \n    <p><b>Maneuver Master (Archetype)</b><br>\
  \ The maneuver master specializes in more complicated moves than simple damage-dealing\
  \ strikes. <br> <b>Bonus Feat</b>: In addition to normal monk bonus feats, a maneuver\
  \ master may select any Improved combat maneuver feat (such as Improved Overrun)\
  \ as a bonus feat. At 6th level and above, he may select any Greater combat maneuver\
  \ feat (such as Greater Grapple) as a bonus feat. At 10th level and above, he may\
  \ select any maneuver Strike feat (such as Tripping Strike) as a bonus feat.<br>\
  \ <b>Flurry of Maneuvers (Ex)</b>: At 1st level, as part of a full-attack action,\
  \ a maneuver master can make one additional combat maneuver, regardless of whether\
  \ the maneuver normally replaces a melee attack or requires a standard action. The\
  \ maneuver master uses his monk level in place of his base attack bonus to determine\
  \ his CMB for the bonus maneuvers, though all combat maneuver checks suffer a –\
  2 penalty when using a flurry. At 8th level, a maneuver master may attempt a second\
  \ additional combat maneuver, with an additional –3 penalty on combat maneuver checks.\
  \ At 15th level, a maneuver master may attempt a third additional combat maneuver,\
  \ with an additional –7 penalty on combat maneuver checks. This ability replaces\
  \ flurry of blows.<br> <b>Maneuver Defense (Ex)</b>: At 3rd level, if a maneuver\
  \ master has an Improved combat maneuver feat, any creature attempting that maneuver\
  \ against the maneuver master provokes an attack of opportunity, even if it would\
  \ not normally do so. This ability replaces still mind.<br> <b>Reliable Maneuver\
  \ (Ex)</b>: At 4th level, as a swift action, a maneuver master may spend 1 point\
  \ from his <i>ki</i> pool before attempting a combat maneuver. He can roll his combat\
  \ maneuver check for that maneuver twice and use the better result. This ability\
  \ replaces slow fall.<br> <b>Meditative Maneuver (Ex)</b>: At 5th level, as a swift\
  \ action, a maneuver master can add his Wisdom modifier on any combat maneuver check\
  \ he makes before the beginning of his next turn. He must choose which combat maneuver\
  \ check to grant the bonus to before making the combat maneuver check. This ability\
  \ replaces purity of body.<br> <b>Sweeping Maneuver (Ex)</b>: At 11th level, a maneuver\
  \ master can make two combat maneuvers as a standard action, as long as neither\
  \ maneuver requires the maneuver master to move. He may perform two identical maneuvers\
  \ against two adjacent enemies, or he may perform two different combat maneuvers\
  \ against the same target. This ability replaces diamond body.<br> <b>Whirlwind\
  \ Maneuver (Ex)</b>: At 15th level, once per day as a full-round action, a maneuver\
  \ master can attempt a single combat maneuver against every opponent he threatens,\
  \ as long as the combat maneuver does not require movement. He makes a single combat\
  \ maneuver check, and it applies to all targets. This ability replaces quivering\
  \ palm.</p> \n   </blockquote> \n   <p>After the first session, I can tell you that\
  \ this archetype has been a blast to play. We will be looking at some of the fun\
  \ toys for the monk in more detail next week, but let me close out with one last\
  \ list of class-filled fun. Here is the revised and expanded list of fighter weapon\
  \ groups. Weapons marked with one asterisk (*) can be found in the <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1\"\
  ><i>Advanced Player's Guide</i></a>, while those with two asterisks (**) are from\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8ies\"><i>Ultimate Combat</i></a>. Enjoy and\
