  \    </div> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Two weeks ago, we introduced the idea\
  \ of major and minor factions, as well as unveiled our first two factions: <a href=\"\
  /community/blog/v5748dyo6sgn1?Pathfinder-Society-Second-Edition-Preview\">the Horizon\
  \ Hunters and Radiant Oath</a>! There's a lot of great information in that blog\
  \ about our approach to factions, choosing leaders, and more, so definitely check\
  \ it out. On Saturday at PaizoCon we teased the next two factions, and today we're\
  \ formally introducing them at last. Let's get to it!</p> \n    <h2>Envoys' Alliance\
  \ (Major Faction)</h2> \n    <p>Being a Pathfinder's dangerous work. Travel comes\
  \ with its own dangers, traps seem to be everywhere, and just about everything seems\
  \ ready to eat aspiring agents. What's more, the Pathfinder Society has spent the\
  \ last decade increasingly engaged in major conflicts, each of which saw extraordinary\
  \ rewards yet also loss of life. After virtually nonstop campaigns, the Society's\
  \ roster is sorely depleted. The Envoys' Alliance aims to change that, making the\
  \ Society every stronger, better trained, and better supported.</p> \n    <p><strong>Faction\
  \ Leader</strong>: Once the envoy of an Ekujae elven community in the Mwangi Expanse,\
  \ <strong>Fola Barun</strong> (N female half-elf [Ekujae]) came into contact with\
  \ and later joined the Pathfinder Society through a field commission. She quickly\
  \ established herself as an attentive leader whose even-keeled, professional approach\
  \ not only expanded the Society's understanding of the mighty Vanji River, but also\
  \ helped devastate the Aspis Consortium's predatory operations along that route.\
  \ Having never trained at the Grand Lodge or absorbed the conventional Society wisdom\
  \ imparted to initiates, she was appalled upon first reaching Absalom and learning\
  \ of the many counts of negligence of the past century. She's brought a fresh approach\
  \ to recruitment and supporting agents in the field, which often sees her collaborating\
  \ (and occasionally clashing) with the three deans.</p> \n    <p><strong>Objectives</strong>:\
  \ The Envoys' Alliance is dedicated to recruiting new agents, rescuing Pathfinders\
  \ in distress, and rebuilding the Society in a way that supports and values the\
  \ operatives' lives and wellbeing—at least as much as one can in the adventuring\
  \ world. Through collaboration, the Society can accomplish ever-greater feats—particularly\
  \ with a powerful faction to advocate for the Pathfinders themselves when tasked\
  \ with the Grand Lodge's latest projects.</p> \n    <h2>Verdant Wheel (Minor Faction)</h2>\
  \ \n    <p>No matter how many forbidding jungles, grassy plains, and untamed hills\
  \ agents scout, the Pathfinder Society is not strictly a nature-oriented organization.\
  \ Even so, nature enthusiasts of all stripes—from grizzled trackers to bright-eyed\
  \ ecologists to tenacious druids—gravitate to the Society for the opportunities\
  \ to witness natural wonders, catalog new species, and better protect the world's\
  \ pristine realms. The call for a united voice has only grown over the years, and\
  \ the evolution of the Pathfinder Society provides a perfect opportunity to name\
  \ this organization: the Verdant Wheel. This faction has a particular fondness for\
  \ sensing patterns and cycles, such as that of creation and destruction, as exemplified\
  \ by new growth sprouting from a fire-ravaged field. Yet even those intent on preserving\
  \ that which exists can find a welcome home here.</p> \n    <p><strong>Faction Leader</strong>:\
  \ Nobody entirely agrees on where <strong>Urwal</strong> (NG male lizardfolk) came\
  \ from, though one Pathfinder admits to having encountered him in Varisia several\
  \ years ago and being accosted about a copy of the Pathfinder Chronicles containing\
  \ misleading information. Flustered, the Pathfinder told Urwal that if he were so\
  \ upset, he could visit the Grand Lodge and file a complaint. In 4718 AR, Master\
  \ of Scrolls Kreighton Shaine entered his locked office to find Urwal waiting there\
  \ with five heavily edited volumes of the Pathfinder Chronicles, a stack of supporting\
  \ documentation, and a disappointed glower. \"These are full of errors. I question\
  \ that your agents even traveled to these places. I will bring more; the stars foresee\
  \ it,\" declared the lizardfolk before clambering up a wall and out the window.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>After finding Urwal reorganizing neglected entomology collections, correcting\
  \ placards on a collection of Mwangi artifacts, and painting astrological charts\
  \ on a Grand Lodge walkway—all helpful yet cryptically explained—the three deans\
  \ decided it more prudent to recognize Urwal's esoteric knowledge and benign infiltration\
  \ by granting him a field commission that the lizardfolk's never formally accepted.\
  \ That he's since organized a cohort of nature enthusiasts as the Verdant Wheel\
  \ befuddles the Society's leadership, especially given nobody's yet figured out\
  \ where he came from (even his agents, who maintain ongoing bets about his origins).\
  \ For all his eccentricities, he is a compassionate mentor who encourages his colleagues\
  \ to seek out natures greatest wonders and most humble treasures, understand them,\
  \ and protect them in the way each agent deems best.</p> \n    <p><strong>Objectives</strong>:\
  \ The Verdant Wheel has no single vision of what it means to preserve nature, leaving\
  \ it to an individual's interpretation and the region's unique circumstances to\
  \ determine the best course of action. Agents travel far and wide to study the strange\
  \ and pristine—journeys often bring them into conflict with undead, fiends, and\
  \ aberrations. And most of all, the faction is a home for those who revel in the\
  \ glories of nature in their many forms—even the occasional alien landscape beyond\
  \ Golarion itself.</p> \n    <hr> \n    <p>We're so excited to see these factions\
  \ in action. We'll be previewing the last two factions—the two remaining major factions—\
  in July, plus many other previews in the weeks to come!</p> \n    <p>John Compton<br>\
