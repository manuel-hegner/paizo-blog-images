  \ Marathon: Part 3!</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Saturday, June 6, 2015</p> \n \
  \   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">I just got\
  \ the third report back from the Order of the Amber Die folks, and I'm excited to\
  \ share it with everyone! As a recap, here are links to <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lhbx\"\
  >Part 1</a> and <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lhfu\">Part 2</a>. As usual, I must\
  \ warn everyone reading that there are spoilers in this blog post, so if you're\
  \ playing in the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/Giantslayer\">Giantslayer Adventure\
  \ Path</a> read at your own peril.</p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p>Order of the\
  \ Amber Die is back with the third update on our ambitious endeavor to complete\
  \ Giantslayer in just 6 months!</p> \n      <p>Once again, both players and GM set\
  \ about trying to build on the momentum of the previous marathon. We knew we were\
  \ headed into the Mindspin Mountains, so we acquired a massive backdrop of the peaks\
  \ in all their glory. Our GM stopped returning calls for a couple of days, then\
  \ surfaced with a map from the adventure that we're not sure Paizo intended anyone\
  \ to draw—nearly 70 square feet—the biggest yet. Finally, in a risky move to help\
  \ improve the roster, we also drafted a young but promising rookie to play the role\
  \ of NPC Kurst Grath for this module.</p> \n      <p>No two marathons are the same,\
  \ and when we close the doors on reality and begin a 4-day run of Pathfinder, we're\
  \ never exactly sure how it will all go down. This marathon was massive—totally\
  \ overwhelming—and clocked in at 82 hours, with 57 hours of play culminating in\
  \ a single 25-hour run to complete the adventure just before some careers had to\
  \ resume on Monday morning. We even skipped breaks, which took its toll. Four months\
  \ passed on Golarion. Two of us had real-life birthdays in there somewhere. </p>\
  \ \n      <p>It was AWESOME.</p> \n      <h2>Highlights From our Experience With\
  \ Forge of the Giant God:</h2> \n      <ul>\n       <li>While the adventure was\
  \ diverse, author Tim Hitchcock still delivered one of the single best fighting\
  \ modules in our history. He turned our GM loose to drop us into at least 15 different\
  \ battle maps during our long trek through the Valley of Minderhal.</li> \n    \
  \   <li>Negotiating with giants is not always as easy as a die roll. In a case of\
  \ Quinn's diplomacy gone astray, it was determined by several dozen hill giants\
  \ that Crowe should have to defeat their champion, Kragmuld, for the right to stand\
  \ before the great Cathedral of Minderhal. Not exactly what we had in mind. In a\
  \ fighting pit surrounded by a crowd of cheering giants, Crowe not only survived\
  \ Kragmuld's spiked chain, but put the champion down in 6 rounds—and we woke the\
  \ neighbors.</li> \n       <li>Giantslayer is officially living up to its name:\
  \ the big folk were abundant throughout the adventure, and thanks in part to our\
  \ Escape Route teamwork feat, we slew more than a score of them.</li> \n       <li>During\
  \ this marathon we had a chance to experience something special: an exhilarating\
  \ 20-20-20 from the Amber Die, which is what makes it our namesake.</li>\n     \
  \ </ul> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/20150606-Giantslayer6.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n      </div> \n      <h2>Character Deaths</h2> \n      <ul>\n       <li>While\
  \ exploring the tomb of a giantslayer, Crowe and Ingrahild (whose ancestor was buried\
  \ there) became separated from the party and locked in the sepulcher. Trapped inside\
  \ with them was the broken soul who had betrayed the ancient giantslayer 700 years\
  \ before. An epic struggle ensued, which saw our heroes fight dearly for their lives\
  \ before being forced to share the tomb with its former occupants.</li> \n     \
  \  <li>Player-fatigue is a factor in marathons, and can be lethal for a character.\
  \ In a brave but incomprehensible move, Kurst Grath spurred his mount into battle\
  \ against two stone giant sentinels—alone.</li> \n       <li>Kurst and Ingrahild\
  \ were scouting ahead of the party when they spotted something very, very big. With\
  \ one eye, it noticed them too. Gsurak the huge cyclops stalker moved to erase the\
  \ rangers from Golarion. Kurst sprinted back to get help; as fate would have it,\
  \ Ingrahild was wearing the armor of her ancestor and legendary giantslayer—which\
  \ compelled her to attack.</li> \n       <li>In the final battle above the great\
  \ forge, Zadim engaged Urathash, a stone giant inquisitor of the god Minderhal.\
  \ The slayer brought Sarenrae's will to bear with a flurry of critical hits, but\
  \ it wasn't enough to save him from Urathash's human-bane warhammer.</li>\n    \
  \  </ul> \n      <h2>Current Situation</h2> \n      <p>Our party is surviving this\
  \ AP, and we've had our moments—but not much more. Character deaths have at least\
  \ been well timed, which has avoided TPK, but an absence of about 210,000gp proves\
  \ we have sacrificed dearly. The party is also missing some precious artifacts after\
  \ an encounter with a venerable slag giant. An in-game relationship has fractured,\
  \ causing one of our NPCs to quit the party. Morale is at a low point. What's compounding\
  \ everything is that we have learned where we're headed next: above the snow line\
  \ as autumn descends on the region.</p> \n      <p>This is what it takes to slay\
  \ giants.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20150606-Giantslayer1.jpg\"\
