  \ August 8, 2007</p> \n  <p>With work on <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7xps\"><i>The\
  \ Skinsaw Murders</i></a> wrapping up, we thought we'd give you a brief taste of\
  \ Sean K Reynolds' insightful exploration into Desna, Golarion's goddess of luck,\
  \ travel, and more. Presented here is one of several key myths tied to her faith\
  \ and frequently repeated by members of her flock, as well as a fabulous rendering\
  \ of her holy symbol by Savage Tide alumnus Ben Wootten.</p> \n  <p><b>Lamashtu's\
  \ Trap:</b> In her earliest days as a goddess, Desna's mentor was Curchanus, a mostly\
  \ forgotten god of beasts, travel, and endurance, and she spent many nights listening\
  \ to stories of his travels. Curchanus's enemy was Lamashtu, an equally ancient\
  \ goddess of monsters, madness, and nightmares who longed for his control over beasts.\
  \ Lamashtu set a trap for Curchanus, leading him on a strange wandering path into\
  \ her realm, where she swarmed him with horrible monsters, finally attacking in\
  \ the guise of a great deformed jackal, tearing his beast-dominion from him. This\
  \ wound was too great for the elder deity, and as his last act he willed his power\
  \ over travel to Desna. Since this theft, wild animals have treated mankind as an\
  \ outsider and an enemy rather than a part of nature, and Desna has searched far\
  \ and wide to find a way to force Lamashtu to surrender Curchanus's stolen power.\
  \ The faithful use this story to remind them of Lamashtu's treachery, to honor Curchanus's\
  \ gift to Desna, and to remind them that failure is just a setback, not an end.</p>\
