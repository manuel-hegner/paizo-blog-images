    \ each time she went against tradition, they would all be punished. When Amiri\
    \ finally came of age, her reputation had spread beyond the Six Bears. The other\
    \ tribes took to calling her the \"Soft Chieftain\" of the Six Bears, a name that\
    \ humiliated her almost as much as it did her kin, inferring that they were weak\
    \ for allowing one of their women to grow so independent and strong. None of the\
    \ other tribes wanted any part of her—her continued presence among the Six Bears\
    \ caused much strife between once friendly tribes, and so the elders determined\
    \ that there was but one choice—Amiri had to die. The only problem was the commonly\
    \ held belief that murder of one's kin was the greatest taboo and the surest path\
    \ to Hell. The opportunity to be rid of their troublesome sister rose soon enough,\
    \ when word came of a tribe of frost giants who had been sighted in the nearby\
    \ mountains. The elders organized a warband to scout the mountains and to drive\
    \ back the giants, and they made sure that Amiri was included in the band. Shocked\
    \ but proud to have finally been chosen, Amiri didn't notice how the elders smiled\
    \ at her eagerness to be on her way. The elders knew that Amiri's sense of competition\
    \ would swiftly get her in over her head, and in secret tasked the rest of the\
    \ hunters to goad her into just such a situation. The warband headed up into the\
    \ Kodar foothills, and it wasn't long before they found evidence of giants. One\
    \ morning, the leader of the band rushed into camp, waving a dagger the size of\
    \ a man's arm over his head. The warrior claimed to have single-handedly slain\
    \ a giant and to have taken his dagger, and the others in the band congratulated\
    \ him on his skill and bravery. Amiri took the bait, and announced that she would\
    \ return by sundown with an even greater weapon. She could have no way of knowing\
    \ that the dagger was part of the deception—that the warband had brought it with\
    \ them as a prop to incite her into a foolish plan. What the warband themselves\
    \ didn't anticipate was that Amiri would find a frost giant. After wandering the\
    \ mountains, she came to an immense body at the foot of a cliff—the giant had\
    \ fallen to his death weeks before, and at his side lay his immense bastard sword.\
    \ Although Amiri knew that she had not killed the giant, she also knew that all\
    \ she needed was his sword as proof—certainly her kin wouldn't think to dispute\
    \ her claim with such a grand trophy. Yet when she returned to the place she had\
    \ left her kin, she found the camp empty. Concerned, worried that they had fallen\
    \ victim to the region's dangers, she tracked them, catching up with the warband\
    \ halfway back to the tribal camp. As she approached the camp, though, she realized\
    \ something was amiss—they were talking of her, and they were laughing. Creeping\
    \ unseen to the edge of the camp, she realized that she had been duped. She heard\
    \ her kin mocking her ways, of how she had fallen for their ruse, and how even\
    \ now she was likely cooking in a giant's stewpot. That they seemed grateful and\
    \ so at ease with her death was not what enraged Amiri. It was the proof that\
    \ her own people thought of her as a fool that did it. Eyes blazing, Amiri stepped\
    \ into the camp and held her new sword out, proclaiming that even now she had\
    \ bested them. The other warriors, shocked to see her alive, quickly fell back\
    \ to laughter, pointing out that she could hardly wield such an ungainly weapon.\
    \ Her fury growing, Amiri hefted the weapon and tried to adopt a menacing pose,\
    \ but the weapon's size threw her off balance and she toppled over, much to the\
    \ other barbarian's growing amusement. It was enough. With a roar, Amiri leapt\
    \ back to her feet. Her rage filled her body, clouded her vision, stole over her\
    \ soul. Two of the barbarians had been decapitated by her immense sword before\
    \ they realized that death had come. The battle was swift and brutal, with Amiri\
    \ not noticing the blows that landed on her, simply stepping"
