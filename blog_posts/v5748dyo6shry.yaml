  \ PDF</a></h3> \n      <p><em>Legendary Monks II</em> is the latest volume in our\
  \ series of class-focused player supplements! This volume is centered on the wise\
  \ and capable masters of combat and mysticism, those paragons of insight known as\
  \ monks. This new version of the base class introduced in the <em>Pathfinder Roleplaying\
  \ Game Core Rulebook</em> was designed to be an agile combatant specialized in unarmed\
  \ fighting, honing their body into a force that could rival weapons and armor forged\
  \ by the most capable of smiths. This book is intended to build upon that promise,\
  \ as well as expand the class with flavorful and potent character-building options\
  \ that fully explore the many paths to perfection. This legendary monk class is\
  \ intended to allow the monk to further specialize their combat through several\
  \ new and redesigned class features such as Path of Mastery, which provides a strong\
  \ foundation for a monk's journey, whether based on strength, agility, or mysticism;\
  \ Monk Arts, which grant them several means of using their new Qi resource; and\
  \ Combo Strikes, which reward legendary monks for taking full advantage of their\
  \ rapid-fire style of fighting. Furthermore, brand new archetypes provide further\
  \ opportunities to construct unique characters, such as the black powder-fueled\
  \ Combustion Knuckle and their special firearm-based combat, the gregarious Champion\
  \ of the People who supports and inspires their comrades-in-arms, and the fierce\
  \ Yaksha Disciple who channels the dread-inducing abilities of terrifying guardian\
  \ spirits. Grab this 30-page class supplement today and Make Your Game Legendary!</p>\

  \ series of class-focused player supplements, this time focused on those spellcasters\
  \ gifted with magical power beyond their own comprehension. These mystical savants\
  \ are arcane spellcasters, but the form of their magic is altered by the origin\
  \ of their power. The legendary sorcerer is a fully redesigned version of the core\
  \ caster class, with a unique class feature that grants spellcasting flexibility,\
  \ makes cantrips more useful, and expands bloodlines to allow customization of your\
  \ inherent powers rather than fixed advancement. No matter the quest, the legendary\
  \ sorcerer is ready for adventure, with 13 bloodlines including the Aberrant Sorcerer,\
  \ who mutates with each spell cast; the Draconic Sorcerer, who can exhale spells;\
  \ the Elemental Sorcerer, who combines physical strength with the summoning of energy;\
  \ and the Undead Sorcerer, whose magic curses those they touch. You'll also find\
  \ six spectacular archetypes like the arcane seeker, impulsive mage, and disciple\
  \ of violence, alongside nearly two dozen sensational spells and feats perfect for\
  \ unleashing your arcane power with fantastic flair. Grab this amazing 46-page class\

  \ magic; flora, fauna, and the elements with a primal deck; the raw power of life\
  \ and death with a divine deck; or the diverse and balanced options of an arcane\
  \ deck, along with over 50 class feats, from Combination Discard and Pass the Deal\
  \ to Aces and Eights and Three Card Monte, plus a dozen more feats, traits, and\
  \ backgrounds. You'll also find a complete system of Card Casting, with unique spells\
  \ like arcane erosion, untouchable ward, gambler's guise, and bend nature for every\
  \ card in a standard deck that you can heighten and empower by varying the number\
  \ of cards you devote to their power from your mystic hand. You'll also get focus\
