  \    </div> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Before we proceed\
  \ with this month’s Pathfinder Society releases, we wanted to update our community\
  \ on the status of the Playtest Points (PtP), which is holding up the launch of\
  \ the Achievement Points (AcP) system.</p> \n     <p>We believe we’ve found and\
  \ corrected the logic errors responsible for the inaccuracies in the PtP buying\
  \ system. At the same time, we’ve introduced some upgrades for the administration\
  \ of the program. These are both important steps on resolving the outstanding issues.\
  \ While we haven’t gotten the boons attached to the purchase button – that is involved\
  \ in a more comprehensive overhaul – you can find sample copies of the boons linked\
  \ throughout our site, including <a href=\"https://paizo-images.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/image/download/PTP+Rewards-FINAL(with+watermark).pdf\"\
  >here</a>. These changes go live on <b>Monday, November 25, 2019</b>. At this time,\
  \ we are <i>zeroing out</i> all PtP purchases made from launch to date and putting\
  \ those points back in your PtP pool. We ask that you repurchase any items already\
  \ bought. You do not have to rebuy any item for your character, but must remove\
  \ the associated PtP assets that aren’t rebought.</p> \n     <p>One other note –\
  \ after bouncing about on the schedule, the Organized Play blogs are <b>moving to\
  \ Thursday</b> starting December 1st. Tune in then for another update on the program,\
  \ as well as our celebration of our community.</p> \n     <p>And now, I hand the\
  \ blog to Linda, who will give us a sneek peek into our scenarios releasing next\
  \ week. </p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><b>Tonya\

  >Pathfinder Society Scenario #1-08: Revolution on the Riverside</a>, brought to\
  \ you by Kalervo Oikarinen. Journey to the tiny River Kingdom of Artume on the trail\
  \ of a hidden chapter of the Pathfinder Society’s past. But this mission isn’t as\
  \ simple as retrieving old records. Artume’s people have recently deposed a tyrannical\
  \ ruler, and a young new king has risen in his wake. The Pathfinders find themselves\
  \ wrapped into a political situation balanced on a knifepoint, one so tenuous that\
  \ the PCs may well be the ones to choose the kingdom’s fate.</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  \ Pellazar. The land of Vidrian (until recently known as Sargava) wishes to rekindle\
  \ an old trade relationship with the iruxi city of Ekkeshikaar to the south. There’\
  s only one problem—the last time Vidrian’s ships sailed that far south was before\
  \ the massive and unrelenting hurricane known as the Eye of Abendego fundamentally\
  \ reshaped the coastline and changed the currents. With vague references and scraps\
  \ of old maps as a guide, the PCs and a contingent from the Horizon Hunters, including\
  \ Calisro Benarry, sail south to chart a new course. The journey doesn’t go according\
  \ to plan, however. After strange currents, sea monsters, and a mysterious and bizarre\
  \ phenomenon pull the PCs off course, they need to work with newfound iruxi allies\
  \ to find their way back.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/112119_IruxiAstrologer.jpg\"\

  \ port known as a haven for piracy. When the rum flows and tempers flare, these\
  \ pirates aren’t afraid to get their hands dirty in a pub brawl of epic proportions.\
  \ This repeatable quest features three different drinking establishments, each with\
  \ its own flavor of mayhem. The author of this playful adventure is Paizo developer\
  \ James Case. In case you missed the announcement in Tuesday’s blog, James Case\
  \ has recently joined the organized play team, and we’re all super-excited to have\
  \ him on board.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/112119_BarfightHalfling.jpg\"\
