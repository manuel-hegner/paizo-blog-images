              <p>Created by: Ian Speidel</p>
              <p><em>Most people take life too seriously, and you want to change that. Your muse may be a great comedian, someone who can effortlessly lift the spirits of those around them, or even the concept of humor itself. Art inspired by a vaudevillian muse is often absurdist and irreverent, though it can also contain biting satire or scathing criticism of the powers that be.</em></p>
              <p><em>As a bard with a vaudevillian muse, you support your allies by lifting their spirits and combat adversaries with lighthearted antics.</em></p>
              <p><em>This new muse adds seven new feats allow you to make pratfalls, modify casting certain spells, and find hilarious new ways to mock your enemies while the three new focus spells will really leave your foes with pie on their faces!</em></p>

Some view their creations as works of art, others view them as the closest thing they will ever have to children, and some just can’t stand the inefficiency of constantly having to restock their forces with fresh corpses. Whatever their reasons, caring necromancers need magic that goes beyond the mere raising of corpses.</em></p>
