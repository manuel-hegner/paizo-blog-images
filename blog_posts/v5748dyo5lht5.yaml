  articleBody\"> \n    <p>Hi, I'm Owen K.C. Stephens, the host of RPG Superstar. Welcome\
  \ to the beginning of Season 9!</p> \n    <p>You probably already have some questions!</p>\
  \ \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Once again, we'll be doing things a little differently\
  \ for RPG Superstar. First, as you may have guessed, the next contest is happening\
  \ MUCH earlier in the calendar year than before. This time we are starting the Open\
  \ Call round next Friday, August 7th. We'll run five rounds total to find our winner,\
  \ who will be announced October 30th. There are lots of reasons for the scheduling\
  \ changes, not the least of which is that fans, potential contestants, and judges\
  \ can't participate when we hold it over the holidays.</p> \n    <p>Every year there\
  \ are some folks who would like to be involved, but don't hear about the contest\
  \ until after it's gotten started, so we're announcing it early! The hope is that\
  \ by announcing the schedule in advance, we can encourage fans to help get the word\
  \ out and increase the chances that everyone who wants to be part of this event\
  \ can do so. We also announced the new schedule at the \"Be the Next RPG Superstar\"\
  \ panel yesterday at Gen Con.</p> \n    <p>It's also worth noting that we've switched\
  \ to \"Seasons\" of the contest, rather than attributing each to a year. Since this\
  \ is the ninth RPG Superstar contest, we're calling it \"Season 9.\" That's a change\
  \ in name only, since we've already crowned Monica Marlowe as Superstar 2015. We\
  \ thought it was important for the folks involved in the both 2015 and Season 9\
  \ to know they don't have to “share\" Superstar titles and achievements.</p> \n\
  \    <p>The above are only a few of the things that we've changed up this time.\
  \ How we determine the Top 32 and our 4 alternates is now going to be decided exclusively\
  \ by the popular vote. We'll have the same comparison voting we've done for the\
  \ past several years, but the bottom few percentages of vote-getters will be culled\
  \ out every few days. Once voting closes, we'll also provide a list of the items\
  \ that fell short of this mark, but landed in our top 100 entries in alphabetical\
  \ order. For the first time, all the voting for the Open Call is entirely in the\
  \ hands of the fans. Our Open Call judges will give feedback about the Top 32 because\
  \ we know how important that feedback is to a lot of people, but not until after\
  \ voting is over.</p> \n    <p>Here are a few more Season 9 details:</p> \n    <ul>\n\
  \     <li>The Open Call round has changed to: design a wondrous item, magic armor,\
  \ or magic weapon</li> \n     <li>We're allowing 50 words of description for the\
  \ maps in Round 2</li> \n     <li>We're going to have some pre-generated maps contestants\
  \ must use for their encounter design in Round 4.</li>\n    </ul> \n    <p>Exact\
  \ rules for later rounds will be available as the contest progresses. The main thing\
  \ to know for Open Call is the category of items to submit, that we aren't allowing\
  \ siege weapons, intelligent items, or cursed items, and that the only rules contestants\
  \ should reference are those available on the PRD.</p> \n    <p>We also have a wonderful\
  \ line of judges lined up including two return RPG Superstar winners, some interesting\
  \ challenges, and many fewer last-second twists than last year. Which isn't to say\
  \ we may not have more twists in the future! I believe making sure we don't get\
  \ into a rut is important, but for now, the earlier contest schedule and revisions\
  \ to Open Call are plenty of change.</p> \n    <p>So get your calculators and graph\
  \ paper ready, warm up your playtesting dice, and spread the word for everyone to\
  \ prepare for RPG Superstar Season 9! You can find more information on the main\
