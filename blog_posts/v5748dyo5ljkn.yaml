  \ Never Changes!</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Friday, February 24, 2017</p> \n  \
  \ <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Conflict rages\
  \ across many portions of Golarion, but no two nations are defined and shaped by\
  \ the war that rips through them quite like Molthune and Nirmathas. More than 8\
  \ decades of bitter unrest and violence inextricably links these two countries;\
  \ imperialist Molthune seeks to bring rebellious Nirmathas back into its fold, while\
  \ fiercely independent Nirmathas can't help but rabble-rouse even when peace seems\
  \ at hand.</p> \n    <p>Beyond these basic details from the <a href=\"/products/btpy8ief\"\
  ><em>Inner Sea World Guide</em></a>, though, we've said little about Molthune and\
  \ Nirmathas—until now. <a href=\"/products/btpy9qif?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Lands-of-Conflict\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Lands of Conflict</em></a> is just hitting shelves\
  \ now, and it contains 64 pages about these two complex nations. I couldn't be more\
  \ proud about how it turned out.</p> \n    <p>For the first time, we provide an\
  \ in-depth look at the inner workings of these two lands, including the complex\
  \ governmental structure of Molthune and the disparate populace of Nirmathas. The\
  \ illustrious Amber E. Scott—our superstar author guest of honor for this year's\
  \ <a href=\"/paizocon\">PaizoCon</a>!—did a phenomenal job fleshing out both nations,\
  \ their history and motivations, the ongoing conflict, and the wild adventures you\
  \ could set there. Amber has turned Molthune and Nirmathas into living, breathing\
  \ places that Game Masters could use as a setting for years to come.</p> \n    <p>Speaking\
  \ of, if you're interested in adventures that take place here, you'll want to check\
  \ out the upcoming <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/ironfangInvasion\">Ironfang\
  \ Invasion Adventure Path</a>, developed by Crystal Frasier, in which a hobgoblin\
  \ army invades Nirmathas!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\

  \ </div> \n    <p>But deep lore and context is not all this book offers. We've also\
  \ included a new militia system designed to allow any party to build, advance, and\
  \ lead their own band of fighters. It's particularly appropriate for the Ironfang\
  \ Invasion Adventure Path, though this subsystem can easily be used in any game.\
  \ The militia system marks the debut of author Lissa Guillet, who is also Paizo's\
  \ own systems administrator. Lissa did a great job building and parsing rules that\
  \ can slot seamlessly into any appropriate backdrop.</p> \n    <p>Beside all of\
  \ the above, <a href=\"/products/btpy9qif?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Lands-of-Conflict\"\
  ><em>Lands of Conflict</em></a> includes a host of new Molthuni and Nirmathi troops,\
  \ large gazetteers of each nation, robust nation and settlement maps, and much more.\
