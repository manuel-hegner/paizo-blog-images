  \   <p class=\"date\">Thursday, October 1, 2009</p> \n   <p>After a lengthy, globe-trotting\
  \ adventure, I am finally back and well rested from my journey to the future. I\
  \ am here to tell you that Gen Con Australia 2009 was a big success! For those of\
  \ you that missed it, I thought this would be a good time to recap my trip to Australia\
  \ and the news from the con.</p> \n   <div align=\"center\">\n    <a href=\"/image/content/Conventions/GenConOz2009-Skyline.jpg\"\
  \ target=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"/image/content/Conventions/GenConOz2009-Skyline_360.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n   </div> \n   <p>Flying to Australia is hard, even if you\
  \ are not very tall. The plane ride from LA to Sydney alone took about 14 hours.\
  \ Arriving in Brisbane (two days after I left thanks to the international date line),\
  \ I was greeted by some of the friendly con staff and some truly terrific weather.\
  \ I spent some time exploring the city, including a wonderful tour down the Brisbane\
  \ River, but no trip to Brisbane would be complete without paying a visit to the\
  \ Australia Zoo (of Steve Irwin fame). When we arrived, Mark, my incredibly helpful\
  \ guide, explained that most of the animals inside were ready for their tryouts\
  \ to get into <i>Bestiary II</i>. Let me tell you, the animals in Australia do not\
  \ disappoint!</p> \n   <div align=\"center\">\n    <table border=\"0\">\n     <tbody>\n\
  \      <tr>\n       <td colspan=\"2\"><a href=\"/image/content/Conventions/GenConOz2009-Awwww.jpg\"\
  \ target=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"/image/content/Conventions/GenConOz2009-Awwww_360.jpeg\"\

  \ target=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"/image/content/Conventions/GenConOz2009-Croc_180.jpeg\"\

  \   <p>From Koala's to Kangaroos, the Australia zoo is a real \"hands on\" experience,\
  \ allowing you to feed and get up close to all of the animals. Except for the large\
  \ and hungry ones, such as their extensive crocodile exhibits. Lucky for us, we\
  \ showed up in time to catch one of the crocodile <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMYcMB0QKIA\"\
  \ target=\"nofollow\">feeding</a> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiHyHUggcbg\"\
  \ target=\"nofollow\">demonstrations</a>. Yeah, I am beginning to think that CR\
  \ 2 might be a bit underrated. We also got to take a good look at the Cassowary,\
  \ one of the world's biggest and deadliest birds. Apparently, the claws on its toes\
  \ can rip a man open with relative ease. Terror bird anyone?</p>\n   <p> </p>\n\
  \   <div align=\"center\">\n    <a href=\"/image/content/Conventions/GenConOz2009-Pathfinder.jpg\"\
  \ target=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"/image/content/Conventions/GenConOz2009-Pathfinder_360.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n   </div> \n   <p>After the zoo, it was time for the Gen Con\
  \ Australia to get underway. There were thousands of folks at the show, playing\
  \ board games, card games, miniature games, and many RPGs. The Pathfinder RPG fans\
  \ were there in force, playing a lot of Pathfinder Society games thanks to the tireless\
  \ efforts of Stephen White (DarkWhite to those that lurk on the boards), who organized\
  \ and ran more tables than any sane man should. Much of my time was spent talking\
  \ to fans, participating in a host of seminars, and signing books (I may have signed\
  \ over 50% of the <i>Core Rulebooks</i> on the continent).</p> \n   <p>Of course,\
  \ the big seminar that everyone was waiting for was the \"What's Next For Pathfinder?\"\
  , where I spilled the beans on the final two classes to appear in the <i>Advanced\
  \ Player's Guide</i>, set to release next August. But that was not all. I had another\
  \ surprise in store for the attendeesâ€”a first look at one of the new classes. Tune\
  \ in tomorrow for all the juicy details!</p> \n   <p>Jason Bulmahn<br> Lead Designer</p>\
