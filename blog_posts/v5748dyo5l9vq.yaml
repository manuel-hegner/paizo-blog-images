  \ Lucas On Leigh Brackett</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, January 6, 2009</p>\
  \ \n   <p>When we started publishing <a href=\"/planetstories\">Planet Stories</a>,\
  \ one of our goals (in fact, the <i>primary</i> goal) was to publish books that\
  \ were not just great stories, but also historically significant. Books that altered\
  \ the course of science fiction history, that helped invent genres and whose authors\
  \ managed to indelibly alter the way we think about SF.</p> \n   <p>Yet sometimes\
  \ the impact of a given novel isn't felt immediately—as with music or any other\
  \ art, it's sometimes the imitator or the student who makes a bigger splash than\
  \ the original. (After all, Michael Jackson didn't invent the moonwalk, he just\
  \ popularized it.) Leigh Brackett is the perfect example of this phenomenon—while\
  \ she was huge in her day, modern readers know her mainly through those authors\
  \ she mentored and works she influence. Folks like Ray Bradbury.</p> \n   <img src=\"\

  9\"> \n   <p>Or, you know, <i>Star Wars</i>.</p> \n   <p>Within the first ten pages\
  \ of a Leigh Brackett book, you can immediately see the resemblance between her\
  \ gritty, realistic worlds (and characters!) and the universe George Lucas brought\
  \ us in what has come to be probably the most popular science fiction work of all\
  \ time. (Heck, her Martian city of Jakara or Skeg on Skaith might as well <i>be</i>\
  \ Mos Eisely, to my imagination.) But though we all knew that George Lucas must\
  \ have taken inspiration from Brackett—why else would he commission her to write\
  \ the first draft for <i>The Empire Strikes Back</i>?—we've never really heard him\
  \ speak about it.</p> \n   <p>Until now. For <a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy83x7\"\
  ><i>The Reavers of Skaith</i></a>, the last book in Leigh Brackett's marvelous <a\
  \ href=\"/search?q=skaith&amp;what=all\">Skaith trilogy</a>, we were fortunate enough\
  \ to have The Man Himself write an introduction talking about his relationship with\
  \ Brackett's worlds, the character of Eric John Stark, and their influence on his\
  \ beloved classics. And it confirmed everything we had suspected: </p> \n   <blockquote>\
  \ \n    <p>Beyond the mechanics of the adventure itself, beyond the clash of heroes\
  \ and villains, beyond the heroic narrative, Leigh created a world of gritty complexity\
  \ and layered reality. It was a universe with a working political system (wonderfully,\
  \ painfully and realistically dysfunctional) and an unjust social hierarchy. I never\
  \ had the sense that it was designed in service of a simple science fiction plot.\
  \ Rather, it was as if she had selected this fully realized backdrop, and chosen\
  \ to place Stark into a world already in motion. It was dense and rich and completely\
  \ lived-in, a supposed reality that commanded respect. It was a complexity worthy\
  \ of her genre-contemporaries, guys like Frank Herbert, Isaac Asimov and J. R. R.\
  \ Tolkien, but told by way of a swashbuckling, space-faring barbarian. If this was\
  \ escapism, it was for a new generation of sophisticated genre fans.</p> \n    <p>It\
  \ was into that climate—Leigh's climate—that <i>Star Wars</i> and I showed up on\
  \ the scene. I had tried to capture my own nostalgia for the movies I grew up with,\
  \ including the movies that Leigh had written. I loved that organic flow of film-speak\
  \ that balanced between heightened reality and easy, comfortable, conversational\
  \ dialogue. And her groundwork had helped to inspire me to move away from the squeaky-clean\
  \ image of cinematic science fiction. I liked the idea of a lived-in universe, with\
  \ a seamy, worn underbelly as fully cooked as the futuristic aspects. I loved exploring\
  \ fringes and outskirts. It was there that Leigh had set Stark's adventures, and\
  \ it was far from the center of the universe that I set <i>Star Wars</i>.</p> \n\
  \   </blockquote> \n   <p>To hear the rest of what Mr. Lucas has to say, pick up\
  \ <a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy83x7\"><i>The Reavers of Skaith</i></a> and\
  \ dive into a new world—one that may be more familiar than you imagine.</p> \n \
