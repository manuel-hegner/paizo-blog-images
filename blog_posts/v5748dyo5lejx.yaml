  \ to announce today that the next major Pathfinder Battles release will be a full\
  \ 55-figure set inspired by Paizo’s popular <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/skullAndShackles\"\
  >Skull &amp; Shackles Adventure Path</a>! Skull &amp; Shackles casts players in\
  \ the role of a gang of pirates with their own ship, struggling to make a name for\
  \ themselves in the treacherous southern seas of the Pathfinder Campaign Setting!</span></p>\
  \ \n    <p>The new <a href=\"/products/btpy8xg6\">Skull &amp; Shackles</a> Pathfinder\
  \ Battles prepainted fantasy miniatures set provides players and GMs with legions\
  \ of figures to kit out their seafaring campaigns, from pirates to aquatic menaces\
  \ to undead horrors from the briny deep!</p> \n    <p>Our partners at WizKids have\
  \ been delivering amazing new sculpts and killer paint masters on a weekly basis,\
  \ and things are moving very rapidly with this set as we head toward its summer\
  \ 2013 release (more later on the specific date when WizKids locks down a few more\
  \ details on the manufacturing side).</p> \n    <p>As with previous major Pathfinder\
  \ Battles releases, the <a href=\"/products/btpy8xg6\">Skull &amp; Shackles</a>\
  \ set features a special limited-edition figure available only to folks who purchase\
  \ a case. This time around, it’s the <a href=\"/products/btpy8xg5\">Gargantuan Skeletal\
  \ Dragon</a> Brinebones, a major antagonist in the campaign that easily stands toe-to-bony-toe\
  \ with our previous Gargantuan dragon releases (and other Gargantuan dragons yet\
  \ to come). Check out these very early behind-the-scenes photos of the Gargantuan\
  \ Skeletal Dragon from WizKids’s factory!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n\
  \     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130308-Dragon.jpg\"><img src=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130308-Dragon_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a> <a\
  \ href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130308-Dragon2.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130308-Dragon2_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Of course, the set contains a fair share\
  \ of Small, Medium, and Large figures as well. Let’s take a look at a few of these\
  \ water-logged beasties for just a hint of what’s in store when the set releases\
  \ this summer.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130308-SeaTroll.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130308-SeaTroll_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Here we have the squamous Sea Troll, a deadly denizen\
  \ of the deeps eager to munch your player characters into chum. He stands with a\
  \ bit of a curved spine, making him a little smaller than the <a href=\"/products/btpy8wsy\"\
  >Troll Champion</a> from the <a href=\"/products/btpy8v0b\">Shattered Star</a> set.\
  \ But when you get this figure in hand, you’ll agree that he fits right in with\
  \ his big land-dwelling brother. Only I think he may be a little bit cooler, which\
  \ is saying something, since the Troll Champion is my favorite figure from the last\
  \ set. When WizKids brought the Sea Troll to our office, everyone agreed that it\
  \ was a step forward for the line. You guys are going to love it. </p> \n    <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130308-Pirate.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130308-Pirate_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Of course, the set includes lots of pirates, with\
  \ this guy here being just the first of several we’ll show off in the coming weeks.\
  \ The sculpt detail on this fellow is amazing, and I suspect he will see lots of\
  \ use by GMs as well as players looking for a cool swashbuckling figure.</p> \n\
  \    <p>There are, of course, lots more figures to show off in this set, but we’\
  ve got a lot of weeks between now and the summer and plenty of time to show them\
  \ all off.</p> \n    <p>In the coming months, look forward to more pirates, more\
  \ aquatic creatures, more creatures never before produced in prepainted plastic,\
  \ and more figures specifically demanded by you here on paizo.com. </p> \n    <p>And\
  \ while you’re checking out the <a href=\"/products/btpy8xg6\">Skull &amp; Shackles</a>\
  \ set, keep in mind that WizKids is hard at work on the NEXT set after that. With\
  \ the set-to-set improvement we’ve seen on paint steps and sculpts we’ve seen so\
  \ far, I can’t even imagine how amazing THAT one is going to be!</p> \n    <p>More\
  \ next week, you scallywags!</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p> \n\
