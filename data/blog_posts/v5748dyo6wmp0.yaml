  \     <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Welcome! I’m Michael Sayre,\
  \ the Director of Rules &amp; Lore here at Paizo, and I’m here to talk about some\
  \ of the fun and exciting stuff we’ve got coming for you in <em>Pathfinder War of\
  \ Immortals</em>! Specifically, I’m going to talk to you about some of the new character\
  \ content we’ve got coming your way.</p>\n      <p>Class archetypes have been something\
  \ that have existed, at least in theory, since the beginning of Pathfinder Second\
  \ Edition. These are a type of archetype that is taken at 1st level, requires you\
  \ to take a specific 2nd-level feat, and often trades out some specific portion\
  \ of your class features (whether adding or removing a class feature entirely, requiring\
  \ you to take a specific version of a class feature, or some similar adjustment).\
  \ <em>War of Immortals</em> introduces a new set of class archetypes to the game,\
  \ so let’s dive into talking about those!</p>\n      <br>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ Art by Kendal Gates.</p>\n      </div>\n      <br>\n      <h3>Avenger</h3>\n \
  \     <p>The first of the new class archetypes I’m going to talk about is the <b>avenger</b>.\
  \ This class archetype for the rogue was inspired by the iconic of a Pathfinder\
  \ First Edition class, the slayer. This iconic, Zadim, was a potent dual-wielding\
  \ combatant who worked for a splinter branch of Sarenrae’s faith. For <em>War of\
  \ Immortals</em>, we wanted Zadim and the avenger class archetype to be very representative\
  \ of the type of rogue character who would get involved in godly affairs.</p>\n\
  \      <p>This rogue class archetype requires you to choose a deity, adjusts your\
  \ starting skills, gives you a special avenger racket, and replaces the rogue’s\
  \ surprise attack class feature with the Hunt Prey action. It also makes some adjustments\
  \ to your sneak attack, allowing you to sneak attack with your deity’s favored weapon.\
  \ Avengers excel at combatting enemy priests while wielding the favored weapons\
  \ of their chosen deities, making them deadly and feared warriors during a time\
  \ when gods and their servitors are at war!</p>\n      <br>\n      <div class=\"\

  \ 13px;\">The bloodrager Trzikhun. Art by Kendal Gates.</p>\n      </div>\n    \
  \  <br>\n      <h3>Bloodrager</h3>\n      <p>In Pathfinder First Edition, the <b>bloodrager</b>\
  \ was a class that mashed together the sorcerer and the barbarian to create a bloodline-oriented\
  \ warrior with rage and limited spellcasting. We wanted to reimagine this class\
  \ for Pathfinder Second Edition into something that better embodied the name and\
  \ that tied more tightly into our game world, which is what we’ve done with this\
  \ barbarian class archetype. With that reimagining, we brought a new character in\
  \ to represent the concept: Trzikhun, Reaper of Ukuja, a Matanji orc who is part\
  \ of a tradition of orcish demon-slayers who drink the blood of shadow demons to\
  \ gain magical power.</p>\n      <p>Bloodragers have some modified skills and must\
  \ choose the bloodrager instinct, which gives them blood rage. Blood rage allows\
  \ the bloodrager to inflict persistent bleed damage while raging and applies their\
  \ additional damage from rage to their spells. Their dedication feat at 2nd level\
  \ gives them spellcasting and adds the rage trait to the spells they gain from this\
  \ archetype while they are raging, as well as giving them the Harvest Blood action,\
  \ which allows them to refresh their temporary Hit Points and boost their saving\
  \ throws against the magical attacks of enemies who they have used Harvest Blood\
  \ against. This ability plays into later feats like Spelldrinker, which allows them\
  \ to temporarily add spells to their repertoire when using Harvest Blood based on\
  \ the type of target creature, such as granting them the <em>wall of thorns</em>\
  \ spell when they use Harvest Blood against a fey enemy!</p>\n      <br>\n     \

  \       <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\">The vindicator Imrijka. Art by Kendal Gates.</p>\n\
  \      </div>\n      <br>\n      <h3>Vindicator</h3>\n      <p>The final class archetype\
  \ we’re going to talk about today is the <b>vindicator</b> class archetype, which\
  \ alters the ranger class. This class archetype requires the ranger to choose a\
  \ deity, is automatically trained in Religion instead of Nature, and is trained\
  \ in their deity’s favored weapon, gaining deadly simplicity if that weapon’s damage\
  \ dice is smaller than d6 and treating the weapon as martial for the purposes of\
  \ proficiency if the weapon is advanced. They also gain a special hunter’s edge\
  \ called the vindication edge and learn their warden spells as divine spells, as\
  \ well as gaining the ability to select domain spells as appropriate to their deity.\
  \ They gain their deity’s sanctification and have some other adjustments to class\
  \ features like trackless journey and masterful hunter to make them better fit with\
  \ the other changes.</p>\n      <p>This class archetype is represented by Imrijka,\
  \ who was the iconic inquisitor in Pathfinder First Edition. As part of her update\
  \ to Pathfinder Second Edition, Imrijka’s outfit is now done in Pharasma’s holy\
  \ colors, and she is known as a vindicator; only vindicators of evil deities are\
  \ called inquisitors.* This class archetype allows characters like Imrijka to combine\
  \ the ranger’s strong skill and combat chassis with the potent focus spell casting\
  \ supported by the vindication edge, making vindicators well-rounded characters\
  \ who excel at hunting down monsters who lurk among the faithful of their chosen\
  \ religion. With powerful focus spells like <em>vindicator’s mark</em> and <em>vindicator’\
  s judgment</em>, the vindicator can mark their prey, hunting them down and dealing\
  \ devastating damage. With feats like Call the Hunt, vindicators make their hunted\
  \ prey off-guard if they and at least one of their allies are both adjacent to the\
  \ target, and the vindicator can share their divine sanctification with their allies!</p>\n\

  \      <p>With these three class archetypes (which are not the only new class archetypes\
  \ in the book!), we’ve brought a couple old friends forward from Pathfinder First\
  \ Edition and enabled some new character concepts that weren’t quite able to be\
  \ fully realized to our satisfaction in Pathfinder Second Edition. We’ve also added\
  \ powerful new warriors to our players’ arsenals that each have their own particular\
  \ motivations to participate in the War of Immortals. We’re looking forward to seeing\
  \ you unleash them when the book drops this October!</p>\n      <p style=\"margin-left:\
