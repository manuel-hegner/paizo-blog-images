  \ \n    <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, December 1, 2015</p> \n    <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"\
  > \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">I've stood by as my fellow designers on the\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame\">Pathfinder Adventure Card Game</a> have\
  \ spoken their pieces on which character they believe to be the best ever and I've\
  \ held my tongue. Why? Because, though I've known all along why they were wrong,\
  \ I needed to bide my time. I needed to wait until all the pieces were in place,\
  \ all the correct products produced and available to the fans... all the evidence\
  \ available, so I could show definitively and without fear of serious rebuttal that\
  \ the best character ever is Lini.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6001-Lini-Token-Front.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6001-Lini-Token-Front_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n     </div> \n     <p>Lini is the O.G. Best Character Ever. She was my go-to\
  \ character during the original playtests of the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame\"\
  >Pathfinder Adventure Card Game</a>, and she quickly earned a reputation as \"pushing\
  \ the power envelope.\" It wasn't so much that any single power she had was too\
  \ broken, but she became an engine that made the game easier for everyone. That\
  \ engine is largely preserved in her <em>Rise of the Runelords</em> form.</p> \n\
  \     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6001-Lini-Front.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6001-Lini-Front_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6001-Lini-Back.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6001-Lini-Back_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n     </div> \n     <p>The key component of her awesomeness isn't her powers\
  \ (amazing though they are). It's the fact that she has 6 spell slots in her deck.\
  \ There are very few characters with that many spell slots, and almost none of them\
  \ are divine casters. This gives Lini the ability to fill her deck with Healing\
  \ spells, which not only keep her and her companions alive, but more importantly\
  \ recycle the cards in Lini's discard pileâ€”including the healing spells themselves!\
  \ She has a nearly infinite engine for playing her cards over and over again.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Her powers have great synergy with this engine. She doesn't have to\
  \ use her spell slots for attacks because she can simply discard a card to get a\
  \ base d10 on combat checks. She can also add 1d4 to <em>any</em> of her checks\
  \ by revealing an ally that has the Animal trait. This essentially gives her that\
  \ bonus to every check she makes, as long as she doesn't discard or otherwise lose\
  \ her ally.</p> \n     <p>Her roles build on this rock-solid foundation. Shapeshifter\
  \ increases her ability to deal with monsters, and Wild Warden makes her more likely\
  \ to recharge all of those Cures she's going to cast.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ></a> \n     </div> \n     <p>I'm not really sure why you'd need more evidence than\
  \ that to declare her the best character ever, but just for fun, let's take a look\
  \ at her <em>Skull and Shackles</em> incarnation. This version pushes her toward\
  \ using her Animal allies instead of revealing them by letting you put them on top\
  \ of her deck, and increases her combat die from a d10 to a d12. The Feral Druid\
  \ lets her reveal a Divine card to attack, and the Aquamancer lets her put Attack\
  \ spells back on top of her deck instead of recharging them. It's a veritable forest\
  \ of powers and directions to take the character!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  > <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6011-Lini-Aquamancer.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6011-Lini-Aquamancer_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6011-Lini-FeralDruid.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6011-Lini-FeralDruid_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n     </div> \n     <p>The newest entry in Lini's powerhouse portfolio is\
  \ from the upcoming <a href=\"/products/btpy9dyj\"><em>Druid Class Deck</em></a>.\
  \ Once again, she gets to reveal Animal allies for an effect, but in this case she\
  \ sends them out to attack! This power gives her a minimum of 1d10+1d6+3 on a combat\
  \ check, and it's easy to increase with feats. The Pack Lord role can increase this\
  \ attack by another 2d6, and gives her the power to acquire any animal allies her\
  \ friends might miss. The real jewel in this new Lini's crown, however, is the Menhir\
  \ Savant, which is unique among all of the characters we've ever made. This new\
  \ role gives her huge advantages for hanging out at closed locations, including\
  \ healing all other characters each turn!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ></a> \n     </div> \n     <p>As you can see, there are many different viable choices\
  \ you can make when you decide to play Lini. She can focus on turning into huge\
  \ animals, casting attack spells, or (my personal favorite) creating an unstoppable\
  \ healing engine. Lini doesn't have any bad choices, and this makes her the Best.\
  \ Character. Ever.</p> \n     <p>Until then, I remain,</p> \n     <p>Paul Peterson<br>\
