  description\">I had a great time at Dragon*Con two weekends ago and then spent several\
  \ days in Birmingham working some things out with Books-A-Million. It’s going to\
  \ be an exciting time for Pathfinder Society in 2013. One topic that came up in\
  \ both Atlanta and Birmingham was international play of Pathfinder Society. It seems\
  \ many people are genuinely interested in reading about Pathfinder Society Organized\
  \ Play all over the world. So, we are going to publish another international Pathfinder\
  \ Society blog post this week.</span></p> \n    <p>This time, we go to one of the\
  \ oldest regions in the world, but one of our newest regions for Pathfinder Society.\
  \ I always had Turkey, specifically Istanbul, as one of my geographic goals to get\
  \ Pathfinder Society up and running. Istanbul has five million more people than\
  \ New York City, an internationally renowned university, and a lot of young people\
  \ hungry for RPGs in general, and campaign play specifically. So, watching the growth\
  \ that Venture-Captain Can Sungur and his Venture-Lieutenants have helped facilitate\
  \ is just awesome. They have grown from a new lodge 4 months ago, to one of the\
  \ top five Pathfinder Society lodges in the world! Without further ado, I present\
  \ to you Can Sungur’s report on Pathfinder Turkey.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n   \
  \  <p>This is Can Sungur, the Venture-Captain for Turkiye. I am a digital marketing\
  \ consultant with past experiences in social media marketing and your classic, analog\
  \ ad business, taking the title of strategist in all of these positions. I have\
  \ been playing world’s oldest roleplaying game since 1999, when I played Baldur’\
  s Gate 2 on my computer for the first time, and I have been a passionate d20 player\
  \ and GM ever since.</p> \n     <p>I found out about Pathfinder and what Paizo was\
  \ trying to create back in 2009, when Selçuk Gözübüyük, who was one of the eldest\
  \ members of the Turkish roleplaying community, and who unfortunately passed away\
  \ in 2011, introduced me to the Alpha version of Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. Since\
  \ then, I have been advocating Pathfinder by my personal effort and that effort\
  \ was fading away with the constant pressure of my professional life. That changed\
  \ 4 months ago, since the day we got the “go!” from Mike Brock, our coordinator.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Pathfinder Society in Turkiye is in its fourth month as of this blog\
  \ post’s date. Let me tell you about the community in Turkiye and what’s been going\
  \ on!</p> \n     <p>Pathfinder Society in Turkiye started in Istanbul. Spread on\
  \ two continents and with a population count of 13 million, Istanbul is the cultural\
  \ capital of Turkiye and the best place to start our Society operations. Of course,\
  \ I haven’t been alone in this. I would like to thank my two partners in crime,\
  \ the Venture-Lieutenants for Istanbul, Yücel Okçu and Mustafa Yılmaz. Also, a thank\
  \ you goes to our team of voluntary Society agents: Mert Erten, Necati Burak Gü\
  cer, Caner Ünsal, Boğaçhan Aydın and Muvaffak Kıral. We got everything rolling together\
  \ and I want to thank each of my friends for sharing my passion about Golarion.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The roleplaying community in Turkiye is quite small considering European\
  \ countries and USA, but in the late years, Turkiye has been in the spotlight of\
  \ many online gaming companies, especially free-to-play games, due to its great\
  \ youth population. As a head start, we decided we would be targeting young players\
  \ to our Society games.</p> \n     <p>Before we started gaming, we went into a month\
  \ of preparations, planning on how to announce our program, designing launch posters\
  \ and flyers, and opening communications with different universities. We launched\
  \ Pathfinder Society games in the end of June in KONTAKT, a sub-culture convention.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Since June 30th, we have been through three organized play days, with\
  \ the number of simultaneous sessions increasing steadily. Currently, we hold two\
  \ biweekly organized play events each month. İstanbul Technical University is now\
  \ hosting us in our organizations. So far, we have reached 74 players. And why are\
  \ 74 players important? Well, probably most of our readers are in their thirties\
  \ or more, with a more or less established roleplaying community in their local\
  \ areas. Even being a metropolis, Istanbul and Turkiye is far from that. As we guessed\
  \ before we started, most of our community is between 18–22 years, and most of our\
  \ players have played their first roleplaying game with us! Imagine that! And in\
  \ September, we have started monthly Pathfinder and Golarion Workshops to get our\
  \ young GMs and players going. So many questions about all the lore and the systems\
  \ and everything! </p> \n     <p>Here is a group photo from our third organized\
  \ play event at ITU.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderSociety/20120910-PFSTurkey.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderSociety/20120910-PFSTurkey_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Also, the current community in Istanbul is very,\
  \ very active! We have a couple of very talented people in our community. Here is\
  \ a little goblin figure made by my girlfriend for my birthday—our lovely goblins\
  \ are as popular as everywhere in Istanbul!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderSociety/20120910-Goblin.jpg\"><img src=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderSociety/20120910-Goblin_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>In the following months, Pathfinder Society is planning to\
  \ expand to Ankara, Eskişehir, and İzmir, all three being centers of attention for\
  \ roleplaying gamers. This will be very exciting for me, as we will be seeing new\
  \ Venture-Lieutenants creating a community in their own city. Also, we are planning\
  \ to merge our organized play events with conventions hosted at different colleges\
  \ and universities.</p> \n     <p>A year ago, I felt like I was alone with all my\
  \ knowledge about Golarion and I had the chance to chat about the game only with\
  \ a couple of gaming friends. Now, all around me, I see Pathfinders coming up with\
  \ questions about the nature of positive and negative energy, the secrets of the\
  \ Mwangi, questions about aboleths, and of course crazy character builds! Just seeing\
  \ people around me talking about optimizations, quarreling about factions, and of\
  \ course, discussing various rules makes me very happy!</p> \n     <p>Can Sungur\
  \ (gyrfalcon)<br> <i>Venture-Captain, Turkiye</i></p> \n    </blockquote> \n   \
  \ <p>My heartfelt thanks goes out to all of the Venture-Captains and Lieutenants,\
  \ coordinators, players, and GMs for making Turkey an amazing area for Pathfinder\
  \ Society with phenomal growth. Keep up the awesome work all!</p> \n    <p>Mike\
  \ Brock<br> <i>Pathfinder Society Campaign Coordinator</i></p> \n   </div> \n  </blockquote>\
