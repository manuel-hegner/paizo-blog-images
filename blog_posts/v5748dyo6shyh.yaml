  \ \n     <blockquote> \n      <h2>THE SPLINTERING OF BONE</h2> \n      <p itemprop=\"\
  description\">Branum and Oska muttered to each other as Amiri prepared. She did\
  \ her best to ignore them. She couldn't understand them, anyway—they were talking\
  \ in an odd, garbled tongue, and suddenly she remembered that, too. The twins with\
  \ their private language, infuriating Maruk because he thought his children were\
  \ making fun of him. He'd always been going on about how his son was going to be\
  \ as mighty a warrior as Maruk himself.</p> \n      <p>She glanced sidelong at Branum.\
  \ He was shivering in the cool air of the cave, and his sister tossed her own cloak\
  \ over his shoulders without comment. So much for Maruk's ambitions. He hadn't lived\
  \ long enough to be disappointed in the boy.</p> \n      <p>Amiri turned on her\
  \ heel, leaving the thought behind, and made her way to the back of the cave. A\
  \ squeeze indeed. She <em>hmmed</em>, hand against the rock.</p> \n      <p>\"Something\
  \ wrong?\" Branum asked.</p> \n      <p>\"Just wondering how many ways to die there\
  \ are, shoving yourself into a crack like that,\" Amiri mused.</p> \n      <p>\"\
  I could list them, if it helps,\" Branum said.</p> \n      <p>She gave him a flat\
  \ look. \"It really doesn't,\" she said. She turned sideways and slid into the gap.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Amiri wasn't afraid of tight spaces, as a rule, but a space this tight,\
  \ it worked its way into the back of your brain, where all the deepest, most primal\
  \ instincts hung around to tell you what was going to kill you. This was a killing\
  \ space. A grasping, crushing, suffocating space. There wasn't even room to set\
  \ her feet flat on the floor—she had to brace her legs at odd angles, push her way\
  \ through with her calves and shoulders and by pulling with the tips of one outstretched\
  \ hand. Behind her, Branum was praying. Behind him, Oska muttered to him or to herself,\
  \ Amiri couldn't tell. She couldn't turn her head to look. It was like having ghosts\
  \ at her back, whispering unseen.</p> \n      <p>Then, suddenly, she was free. The\
  \ walls of the squeeze released her, and she stepped easily out into a wider tunnel.\
  \ She worked her limbs, flexing to bring some feeling back into them.</p> \n   \
  \   <p>\"Made it through,\" she called back. Branum thanked a half-dozen gods and\
  \ other entities, and the sounds of scraping and huffing intensified as the twins\
  \ hurried to join her. From there, the trek was easier, though hardly swift going.\
  \ Without the sun to track time, it was hard to tell how long they traveled, clambering\
  \ over shelves of rock and backtracking when they hit dead ends. They hadn't found\
  \ an exit yet, but they hadn't run out of cave, either.</p> \n      <p>\"I can smell\
  \ fresh air,\" Branum said at last, sniffing theatrically.</p> \n      <p>Amiri\
  \ stood next to him and tested the air. \"This way,\" she said, setting off down\
  \ a side tunnel. She only made it a few steps before the tunnel abruptly ended in\
  \ a small, round chamber.</p> \n      <p>The floor was scattered with bones.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>She reached for her dagger, cautioning the others back. The bones looked\
  \ animal—mostly. Half a deer lay in the middle of the floor, blood dried black but\
  \ flesh not yet rotted away. Its blood had spattered half the chamber.</p> \n  \
  \    <p>But it wasn’t the deer that held her gaze. Amiri’s eyes were fixed on a\
  \ human skeleton sprawled across an outcrop of rock toward the back of the room.\
  \ Bits of desiccated flesh and moldering clothes clung to the bones. A few scraps\
  \ of leather armor still adorned its hips and chest, stamped with a pattern of paw\
  \ prints and swirling lines, almost impossible to make out after so many years.\
  \ But Amiri remembered them perfectly.</p> \n      <p>\"Who do you think they were?\"\
  \ Branum asked, moving cautiously into the chamber. \"What were they doing down\
  \ here?\"</p> \n      <p>\"Does it matter?\" Oska asked. \"Something's been eating\
  \ things in here. We shouldn't stick around.\"</p> \n      <p>Amiri tightened her\
  \ jaw. \"It matters,\" she said. \"That's Erskar. He was wearing that armor the\
  \ day I killed him.\"</p> \n      <p>Oska hissed between her teeth. Branum looked\
  \ alarmed, straightening up. \"I knew he was with Father that day, but his body\
  \ wasn't found. Some people thought you'd run off together.\"</p> \n      <p>Amiri\
  \ snorted. \"With Erskar? Not on your life.\"</p> \n      <p>\"So he survived? Snuck\
  \ off on his own for some reason?\" Branum mused.</p> \n      <p>\"None of those\
  \ men would have abandoned their clan,\" Oska spat.</p> \n      <p>\"Certainly not\
  \ without most of his guts. Erskar was dead. They were all dead,\" Amiri said, and\
  \ as always, the image was as fresh and real in her mind as the day it happened.\
  \ <em>They brought it on themselves</em>, she thought. They'd meant her to die.\
  \ They'd weaseled their way out of calling it murder, but they'd brought her there\
  \ to meet her end.</p> \n      <p>\"Then how is he <em>here</em>?\" Branum asked.\
  \ Then, \"Oh!\" He pointed to Erskar's chest, and Amiri saw at once what he'd spotted.\
  \ She'd left Erskar gutted on the ground. But the skeleton's legs were splintered,\
  \ one arm broken clean through. And his ribs had been shattered, pried apart.</p>\

  \  <p>Perytons preferred live prey, but in lean times they scavenged, just like\
  \ everything else. So the peryton—or its parent, maybe—had taken the corpse for\
  \ a snack, flying up into the peaks with it. It had eaten its favorite part of the\
  \ body, and apparently not gotten around to the rest. But no peryton would roost\
  \ in these caves, even if it could fit.</p> \n      <p>\"No tunnels <em>out</em>.\
  \ But what about <em>up</em>?” Amiri mused.</p> \n      <p>Branum nodded and lifted\
  \ his crystal, peering up toward the ceiling. And there it was. A chimney leading\
  \ up out of the tunnel. Wider than the squeeze, at least. Wide enough for the corpse\
  \ of a large man to tumble through and be forgotten, rotting away year after year.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>“That’s our way out,” Amiri said.</p> \n      <p>“Looks like it,” Branum\
  \ concurred.</p> \n      <p>“You know, if the peryton’s meals are falling down here\
  \ this frequently…” Oska began.</p> \n      <p>Amiri nodded. “It’s eating up there.\
  \ Which means that’s probably its nest.”</p> \n      <p>“Oh. Lovely,” Branum said.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>“It’s our only option,” Amiri said. “So we’d better get climbing.”\
  \ She’d take fighting the peryton over sticking around here with these cubs, that\
  \ was certain.</p> \n      <p>“Not yet,” Oska said.</p> \n      <p>“You getting\
  \ fond of the place?” Amiri asked her, but Oska glanced sidelong at Branum—who was\
  \ trying to hide the fact that he was limping and out of breath, and pale as the\
  \ belly of a fish.</p> \n      <p>“We should rest a while,” Oska said.</p> \n  \
  \    <p>“I won’t make it up with or without rest,” Branum said, grimacing. “If you\
  \ can get up and secure a rope or something…”</p> \n      <p>“We all go up,” Amiri\
  \ said. She wasn’t going to leave the boy behind. And she certainly wasn’t going\
  \ anywhere alone with his sister. Keeping Branum around was the only way to be sure\
  \ one of them wasn’t going to end up dead.</p> \n      <p>“We’ve got rope. We can\
  \ secure it as we go, help you up,” Oska said. “But I’d rather do that with some\
  \ rest and some food in my belly.”</p> \n      <p>Amiri’s stomach rumbled on cue.\
  \ “I hope you brought something to eat, because that deer’s long past being appetizing,”\
  \ she said.</p> \n      <p>Oska gave a curt nod, and against their united front,\
  \ Branum gave in. Oska set down her pack and pulled out salted fish, mashed and\
  \ dried berries formed into a leather, and a handful of nuts. She broke the fish\
  \ into three shares. Amiri expected to be handed a smaller one, but Oska had portioned\
  \ them evenly. Even if she did drop it into Amiri’s hand like she was afraid of\
  \ touching her.</p> \n      <p>“That’s all you brought?” Amiri asked.</p> \n   \
  \   <p>Oska shrugged as she handed her brother his share. “It’s all we had. Like\
  \ I said, game has been scarce.”</p> \n      <p>“You’re young yet. The clan shouldn’\
  t be letting you go hungry,” Amiri said, troubled. “Not Maruk’s kids.”</p> \n  \
  \    <p>She’d spent her years of exile thinking often enough of that last day—and\
  \ less often of the day before. It was painful, remembering the way her clan had\
  \ jeered and mocked her behind her back, had discussed her death with gleeful anticipation.\
  \ But that pain was twinned with anger, and anger was an ally.</p> \n      <p>It\
  \ was the earlier memories that were harder. Remembering not how Maruk had laughed\
  \ at her, but the times they’d laughed together. Remembering not the way he’d died,\
  \ cleaved limb from limb in the face of her rage, but the times they’d raced and\
  \ wrestled and bickered. She’d made Maruk laugh a lot, she remembered. His wife\
  \ had always thought her a bad influence. She’d thought he was one of the few that\
  \ truly didn’t see her as a woman who ought to know her place, but as a warrior\
  \ who’d earned it.</p> \n      <p>“It was like that a while,” Branum said. He sat\
  \ with his legs splayed before him, picking at his food. “We had everything we could\
  \ ask for. Everyone was always telling me how I was going to carry on Father’s legacy.\
  \ Be a great warrior, like he was. And then I wasn’t, and they lost interest.”</p>\
  \ \n      <p>“Someone had to provide for us,” Oska said. She hunched over her food,\
  \ not meeting Amiri’s eyes. “But that only made it worse. Turned near everyone against\
  \ us.”</p> \n      <p>“For feeding yourselves? I know it’s not common for a woman,\
  \ but—\"</p> \n      <p>Oska looked up, eyes alight with hatred. “It’s not just\
  \ <em>not common</em> anymore. Not for the Six Bears. After what you did? ‘Look\
  \ what happens when you let a woman think she’s a warrior,’ they said.”</p> \n \
  \     <p>“You think I didn’t hear that, too? ‘Watch out, or you’ll end up like Amiri,’\
  \ they’d tell the other girls. I never let it stop me,” Amiri said. She’d always\
  \ taken it as a point of pride. <em>Like Amiri</em> meant strong, capable, unstoppable.\
  \ She didn't want the things it denied her—the husband, the children, the days spent\
  \ tending the fire and tanning another hunter's hides.</p> \n      <p>\"And look\
  \ what happened,\" Oska said dully. \"You think that any girl in the Six Bears is\
  \ allowed to even <em>look</em> at a sword, after you proved what a curse it is,\
  \ to let a woman fight? I can't even feed myself and my brother without skulking\
  \ around in secret. Maybe you should have let it stop you. Slow you down. Maybe\
  \ the next girl would've had an easier time of it.\"</p> \n      <p>Amiri grunted.\
  \ \"I won't make myself less than I am. Not for anyone. Being what the clan wanted\
  \ me to be would have killed me.\"</p> \n      <p>\"Then leave,\" Branum whispered.\
  \ They looked at him, surprised. He hadn't spoken this whole time, just stared off\
  \ into the distance, but now his gaze was intense. \"You could have just left.\"\
  </p> \n      <p>\"My <em>kin</em>, your <em>father</em>, arranged to have me killed,\"\
  \ Amiri growled.</p> \n      <p>\"They never did anything to you. Just let you do\
  \ it to yourself,\" Branum said.</p> \n      <p>Amiri shook her head. \"They wanted\
  \ me dead. They betrayed me. And I—\"</p> \n      <p>\"Could have left,\" Branum\
  \ repeated. \"You weren't in danger. They were no threat to you. You could have\
  \ walked away and lived a life to prove them wrong.\"</p> \n      <p>He was wrong.\
  \ Someone else could have walked away, but Amiri couldn't. She was going to die\
  \ that day, or they were. There was never going to be another path.</p> \n     \
  \ <p>\"We should go,\" Oska said roughly. She brushed crumbs from her fingers and\
  \ stood. She put out her hand to help her brother up.</p> \n      <p>Amiri didn't\
  \ know how she could explain what had happened in a way that the two would understand.\
  \ It wasn't that Branum was wrong. She hadn't been defending herself. And it had\
  \ been her own foolish pride and boastfulness that had made any of it possible.\
  \ </p> \n      <p>For her kin to betray her. Humiliate her. Take her home from her—\
  for how could she return, no matter the outcome, once she knew what they had intended?\
  \ They wanted her dead or broken.</p> \n      <p>And she couldn't walk away. <em>She</em>\
  \ couldn't. Someone else might have. Would have. There was nothing to stop her except\
  \ herself. Her rage. Her grief at everything that had been torn so brutally from\
  \ her in those horrible moments.</p> \n      <p>She should have walked away. But\
  \ Amiri of the Six Bears couldn't.</p> \n      <p>Maybe she could, now. But Amiri\
  \ of no clan was not the woman who had been lured into those mountains. She was\
  \ not the woman who had left. And she could not go back to that moment, and stand\
  \ in the place Amiri of the Six Bears stood, and make her choices for her.</p> \n\
  \      <p>She could only move on.</p> \n      <p>Only move up.</p> \n      <p>She\
  \ could only keep climbing.</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p style=\"font-weight:\
