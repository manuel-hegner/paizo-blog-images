  \  <p>Those are the rewards promised to those who conquer the <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7wiy\"\
  >Bloodsworn Vale</a>. In just a few weeks, you might be able to claim those prizes.\
  \ </p> \n    <p>Since we are getting pretty close to the release of this module,\
  \ we realized we have yet to show off a map of this large, untamed wilderness. To\
  \ avoid spoilers, the map is untagged (and might just make for a good player handout,\
  \ if you're thinking of downloading it). That said, there are a couple of points\
  \ of interest on the map that bear some explanation. </p> \n    <blockquote> \n\
  \     <p><b>Fort Thorn:</b> As the only settlement on the map, Fort Thorn (the small\
  \ dot near the center) is of vital importance to the region. Although its commander,\
  \ Sir Tolgrith, hopes one day to make it self-sufficient, it currently depends upon\
  \ a steady stream of caravans for provisions and other basic supplies.</p> \n  \
  \   <p>The fort is a walled community surrounded by a 20-foot-tall palisade of tree\
  \ trunks, upended and carved to points. Beyond this security there is nothing but\
  \ wilderness. Tall trees and endless thickets of wild rose bushes cover much of\
  \ the surrounding terrain. There are no farms or outlying buildings affiliated with\
  \ the fortâ€”any who dwell outside its walls are hermits, monsters, or worse.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>The Path:</b> This trail is being cut through the vale to establish\
  \ a vital trade route with Varisia's neighbors. It is currently under construction\
  \ and time is running out to meet the king's deadline.</p> \n     <p><b>The Petal\
  \ and Coldrun Rivers: </b>These two slow-moving rivers provide fresh water to those\
  \ in the region, although the Petal (which runs past Fort Thorn) has a nasty tendency\
  \ to foul every few weeks, causing sickness in those who drink from it at those\
  \ times.</p> \n     <p><b>Mist Lake: </b>The calm waters of this lake are perpetually\
  \ shrouded in mist that moves overland to cover the nearby swamps. The residents\
  \ of Fort Thorn avoid this area, as they say it is haunted.</p> \n    </blockquote>\
  \ \n    <p>There is, of course, much more to explore in the vast reaches of the\
  \ vale, but to learn about it you just might have to journey there yourself. </p>\
