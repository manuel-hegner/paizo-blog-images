  \ Slime</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Thursday, May 3, 2007</p> \n   <p>Everyone knows\
  \ about goblins and worgs. Going all the way back to Tolkien, the goblin/worg raiding\
  \ party has been a staple of sword and sorcery fantasy. Giving the goblins an iconic\
  \ mount to ride makes them that much scarier, and also that much more usable. No\
  \ longer confined to their underground lairs, a mounted group of goblins can range\
  \ far across the countryside, strike at numerous towns and villages, and generally\
  \ wreak havoc.</p> \n  </blockquote> <a href=\"/image/product/secondary/Modules/9-Slurk_1000.jpg\"\

  \ align=\"right\" alt=\"Slurk\" border=\"0\"></a> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>But why\
  \ should the goblins have all the fun? The poor, abused kobolds lack that traditional\
  \ iconic mount creature, and while they do enjoy their traps, without mounts they\
  \ are a much more stationary threat. With <i><a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7wix\">Crown\
  \ of the Kobold King</a></i>, we decided to change that.</p> \n   <p>Enter the slurk.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Long ago, dwarves dragged giant forest toads beneath the earth and altered\
  \ their physiology with powerful magic in hopes of creating powerful underground\
  \ beasts of burden that would be perfect mounts. The slurk is the disgusting result\
  \ of their aborted efforts. The creature's unappealing slime and foul reek caused\
  \ the dwarves to drive away their creation in disgust. Kobolds, on the other hand,\
  \ are less picky.</p> \n   <p>Slurks are oozy abominations resembling pale, slime-slick\
  \ toads. Their backs drip viscous mucus while their bellies are coated with a thick\
  \ film of greasy slime. They use their slime as an offensive weapon, coating their\
  \ opponents with the glue-like phlegm and making it easier to bring their gigantic,\
  \ walrus-like tusks to bear on their hapless victims. Their sticky back-slime makes\
  \ them ideal mounts for the kobolds, who can adhere to their backs without the need\
  \ for a saddle. The slurks are powerful leapers, and are capable of moving along\
  \ the walls and floor of rough underground tunnels at incredible speed. They are\
  \ not the brightest of beasts, however, and more that one kobold has had his skull\
  \ crushed when his mount smashed his head into the cavern ceiling with a mistimed\
  \ jump.</p> \n   <p>Jeremy Walker <br>Assistant Editor, GameMastery</p> \n  </blockquote>\
