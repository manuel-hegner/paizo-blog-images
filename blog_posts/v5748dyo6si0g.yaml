  >“Droven?”</p> \n     <p>“Yes, Fumbus?”</p> \n     <p>“Home’s good, Droven.”</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Droven was taking time to reacquaint himself with the city that had\
  \ been home for most of his life. Today, as most days since his return, the inventor\
  \ made his way along the streets of Absalom, a covered wicker basket held in his\
  \ right hand. As expected, no sooner had Droven’s metal-shod feet hit the cobblestones\
  \ then Fumbus materialized alongside him, the quiet patter of the goblin’s wide\
  \ feet slapping counterpoint to Droven’s own clanking footsteps.</p> \n     <p>Today,\
  \ Fumbus wore a suspiciously guilty look on his face, and Droven had chosen to alter\
  \ his normal route, which typically brought him down to the Puddles where he delivered\
  \ muffins and stories to some of the local children. Instead, the half-orc inventor\
  \ led his mechanical companion Whirp and Fumbus through the markets of the Coins\
  \ district, waiting for Fumbus to own up to whatever had the goblin so worked up.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Droven suspected that Fumbus had borrowed or accidentally destroyed\
  \ something valuable in the Pathfinder Society’s Grand Lodge and was worried that\
  \ the lodge’s steward, Ambrus Valsin, would punish him for it. Fumbus had an excessive\
  \ reverence for the Pathfinder Society, and the mutton-chopped old venture-captain\
  \ had a particular talent for inspiring fear in the goblin without actually doing\
  \ anything to him at all.</p> \n     <p>Upon realizing that Fumbus was unlikely\
  \ to broach the subject of his distress without prompting, Droven finally asked,\
  \ “So what happened this time?”</p> \n     <p>Fumbus sheepishly explained that a\
  \ piece had come off an astrolabe in one of the Grand Lodge’s smaller libraries,\
  \ completely by accident of course! Before Fumbus could fix it, he’d heard the voice\
  \ of an irate Valsin echoing down the halls and had fled in search of a certain\
  \ inventor who the goblin assumed could set everything right.</p> \n     <p>Droven\
  \ suppressed a smile and was about to tell Fumbus he could indeed fix the astrolabe\
  \ when he realized he’d lost track of Whirp. Turning, he the mechanical “goblin”\
  \ dashing down the street, chasing a bouncing metal gear. Droven didn’t need to\
  \ see Fumbus worriedly poking a finger through the hole in his jacket pocket to\
  \ realize where the gear had come from. Nor did he need to dwell on the chaos a\
  \ goblin-sized construct might cause barreling through a crowded marketplace.</p>\

  ><em>Pathfinder Guns &amp; Gears</em></a></p> \n     </div> \n     <br> \n     <p>“\
  Whirp, wait!”</p>\n     <p> </p>\n     <p>Droven’s command was swallowed by the\
  \ bustle of the streets, and neither he nor Fumbus stopped to see if the construct\
  \ heard him. Nodding to Fumbus, Droven dashed to get between a trundling cart loaded\
  \ with what looked to be expensive pottery and the single-minded construct chasing\
  \ a shiny new “toy.” Fumbus yanked out a new bomb he’d been formulating following\
  \ his time in Arcadia, this one loaded with black flecks of magnetic stone. With\
  \ a slightly belated call to “look up,” Fumbus heaved the bomb between Whirp and\
  \ the bouncing gear, the magnetic burst from the bomb halting Whirp in its tracks\
  \ and pulling the gear to a stop right in front of the construct. After Whirp calmly\
  \ sat down and picked up the now-immobile gear, Droven quickly retrieved the part\
  \ and slid it into a sturdy pocket of his leather bandolier, reassuring Fumbus that\
  \ all would be set right when they returned to the lodge.</p> \n     <p>“Now that\
  \ that’s… sorted, I believe we have some friends wondering where we are.” </p> \n\
  \     <center>\n      <hr width=\"50%\">\n     </center> \n     <p>“Fumbus! Droven!\
  \ WHIRP!” The cries came from a bevy of young children who called the alleys and\
  \ gutters of Absalom their home. Droven had made a habit of visiting these urchins\
  \ between Absalom’s Puddles district and the nearby bustling docks. They were mostly\
  \ young humans left to run wild while their parents focused on putting food on the\
  \ table, though a halfling girl was their apparent leader and a goblin boy was,\
  \ Droven suspected, the culprit who kept turning various bits of castoff garbage\
  \ into decidedly unsafe toys.</p> \n     <p>Three of the little waifs clambered\
  \ up Droven’s side, and the half-orc smilingly obliged them by holding his prosthetic\
  \ limb straight out so they could hang from it like grubby, adorable fruit. Another\
  \ goblin child took Whirp by the hand and began showing the inquisitive construct\
  \ her collection of shiny rocks. As Droven calmly took back several of his tools\
  \ that had somehow found their way into the pockets of the children hanging from\
  \ his mechanical arm, he listened to Fumbus tell everyone the story of their voyage\
  \ across the Arcadian Ocean, as he had several times over the last few weeks.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“Fumbus and Droven make powerful engine. WHOOSH! We fly across the waves!\
  \ A huge serpent, bigger than ten ships, rises up out of the water. RAARGH! Ezren\
  \ magics up a blast of wind and WHIPPOW! We zip past it…”</p> \n     <p>As much\
  \ as Droven hated to interrupt his friend’s story, the inventor noticed that several\
  \ of the children were growing increasingly more interested in the covered basket\
  \ Droven held.</p> \n     <p>“Perhaps a snack for our friends and a drink to keep\
  \ our storyteller’s voice from going hoarse, eh?”</p> \n     <p>The children squealed\
  \ with glee and quickly gathered in a semi-circle around Droven as he removed the\
  \ cloth covering from the top of his wicker basket. Inside was a bottle of chilled\
  \ juice and a pile of delicious, bright yellow muffins, courtesy of a kindly Vudran\
  \ baker who supplied the Grand Lodge. Fumbus filled small vials with a sip of juice\
  \ for each child while Droven handed out the muffins, after which the children snacked\
  \ and drank happily as Fumbus finished his story. </p> \n     <p>“When’s Whirp gonna\
  \ tell us a story?” A little gnome boy’s eyes shone with genuine curiosity even\
  \ as he gently polished Whirp’s metal arm with the edge of his filthy shirt. “I\
  \ bet Whirp beat up a whole bunch of bad guys!”</p> \n     <p>Fumbus nodded in agreement\
  \ and immediately launched into the story of Whirp leaping across the trees of Arcadia\
  \ with a pair of rocket-powered blast boots. The goblin exaggerated slightly, but\
  \ not so much so that Droven felt a need to interject.</p> \n     <p>“Then, BAMMO!\
  \ Whirp comes fallin’ outta the sky and SHWOOP stops the fire from the baddy!” As\
  \ the children cheered at the end of the story, Droven explained that Whirp needed\
  \ Fumbus to tell his stories because the construct was too shy, and also Droven\
  \ had forgotten to give him a mouth (which the inventor promised he’d look into\
  \ fixing just as soon as he had the chance.)</p> \n     <p>Once the tale was done,\
  \ Droven and Fumbus excused themselves from their youthful friends’ company, promising\
  \ to return the next day with more muffins and stories. As the unlikely pair of\
  \ adventurers made their way back to the Grand Lodge, Droven glanced fondly at the\
  \ goblin who had somehow become his most loyal and steadfast friend.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>“Fumbus?”</p> \n     <p>“Yeah, Droven?”</p> \n     <p>“Home’s good, Fumbus.”\
