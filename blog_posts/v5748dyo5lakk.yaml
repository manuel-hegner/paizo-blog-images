  \ \n   <p>Cave raptors are sated; it's time to blog!</p> \n   <p>Yes, editing: the\
  \ sport of grammatically minded kings. So far we've examined the natural growth\
  \ of <a href=\"/pathfinderCompanion/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy87dj\"><i>Dwarves of\
  \ Golarion</i></a>, as well as its invaluable hours of education, and yet we've\
  \ ignored physical fitness. Without a steady regimen of editing, our little manuscript\
  \ could turn into a clumsy butterball, drawing ridicule and cruelty from other game\
  \ products.</p> \n   <p>To keep a product trim, healthy, and happy, it's going to\
  \ need editors to run it through its paces.</p> \n   <p>According to Paizo's editorial\
  \ tag-team of Christopher Carey and James Sutter, an editor's job involves neither\
  \ crushing the dreams of authors nor blindly hacking away at text, but instead is\
  \ a carefully crafted routine to burn off flabby text and improve narrative posture.\
  \ Like a cephalopod, any quality Paizo product needs to hit the gym regularly to\
  \ keep it healthy. Just like any fitness-obsessed octopus will hit both the free-weights\
  \ and the treadmill, Paizo products will rotate their editing to catch problems\
  \ with grammar, spelling, word choice, continuity, voice, and even the occasional\
  \ rewrite to adjust the word count. Even the greatest authors will occasionally\
  \ dip into the candy-coated bacon of purple prose or forget to tie their punctuation,\
  \ so a good editor can help make sure every product can fit into its cover before\
  \ the big class reunion.</p> \n   <p>The amount of editing any given product needs\
  \ is easily determined with the formula <i>n+1</i>, where <i>n</i> is the amount\
  \ of time you actually have to edit the book. Because of this conundrum, it's important\
  \ for editors to make the most of the time they do have. At Paizo, the ideal grammatical\
  \ specimen sees four editorial passes: two from each of Paizo's own hard-nosed prose-wranglers.\
  \ A 'pass' is a single read-through. Obsessive-compulsive as any wild pack rat,\
  \ these editors greedily gobble up any mistakes they sniff out, trading it for proper\
  \ spellings or active voice. And because anyone, even editors, can make mistakes,\
  \ multiple passes and different editors help to ensure that no errors go unexamined.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>For Paizo products especially, the editors also serve the dual role of\
  \ security. They stand constant vigil over continuity of Golarion, ensuring that\
  \ dead NPCs don't crop back up, that cities don't spontaneously shift location,\
  \ and that worst of enemies aren't running around as BFF. The editors have the blessing\
  \ and curse to read every product Paizo releases, from thrilling Planet Stories\
  \ to mysterious modules, and serve as living repositories of the universe.</p> \n\
  \   <p>And yet they stay so svelte, just like the products they care for.</p> \n\
  \   <p>Editing is necessary for the health and longevity of a product. Without it,\
  \ mistakes, typos, and plain, old dead wood can slip through into the final product,\
  \ clogging intakes eventually leading to frustration overheating in readers. The\
  \ heat released by frustrated readers contributes to the inconvenient truth of global\
  \ warming, melting the polar ice caps, flooding coastal regions, and causing alligator\
  \ populations to explode. Ultimately, mankind devolves into primitive tribes of\
  \ swamp dwellers, hiding in terror from the maurading ultra-gators that have made\
  \ this marshy, dystopian Earth their own!</p> \n   <p>So to keep your writing trim\
  \ and healthy, and to ensure the survival of the human race, edit!</p> \n   <p>Now\
  \ that our product is happy, healthy, and knows where its going in life, next week\
  \ we're ready for that special time in every product's life when it truly becomes\
  \ a book. Next week, we examine layout!</p> \n   <p>Crystal Frasier <br>Production\
