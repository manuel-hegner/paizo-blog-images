  \   <p itemprop=\"description\">The first Munchkin sets were sold at Gen Con 2001.\
  \ Starting in January 2016 and going right through Gen Con 2017, we're celebrating\
  \ Munchkin's 15th anniversary! (Yes, for more than 18 months. What's the point of\
  \ having an anniversary if we can't Munchkin-ize our own party?) As part of the\
  \ celebration, we've released a series of Guest Artist Editions of many of our Munchkin\
  \ titles, and we certainly didn't want to leave <a href=\"/store/byCompany/s/steveJacksonGames/byProductType/cardBoardGames/munchkin/munchkinPathfinder\"\
  ><em>Munchkin Pathfinder</em></a> out of the lineup.</p> \n    <p>I had the enjoyable\
  \ task of combing through issues of the <a href=\"/pathfinder/comics\">Pathfinder\
  \ comic books</a> to find an artist whose style was suitable for <em>Munchkin Pathfinder</em>.\
  \ After I got to look through a number of issues (translation: I got to read comics\
  \ for work, because my job is awesome), we decided on Shane White, who has a strong\
  \ visual style that's perfect for Pathfinder and for Munchkin. Luckily for us, Shane\
  \ was just as excited by this project as we were and knocked it absolutely out of\
  \ the park. We were so thrilled with Shane's work that we've contracted him for\
  \ some more projects, including a new booster pack, <a href=\"/products/btpy9o7z\"\
  ><em>Munchkin Pathfinder: Truly Gobnoxious</em></a><a>, and the long-delayed <em>Munchkin\
  \ Pathfinder 2</em>, scheduled for Summer 2017.</a></p><a> <p>There are 168 cards\
  \ in this game, so picking just a few to show off Shane's fantastic work was nearly\
  \ impossible. I pared it down to three that I really love.</p> </a>\n    <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n     <a></a><a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/SJG4423-BlogGoblin.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/SJG4423-BlogGoblin_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p style=\"clear: both;\">First, the Blog Goblin, who absolutely\
  \ embraces his anachronism with a jaunty hat, sunglasses, completely generic coffee,\
  \ and a laptop whose logo deserves a second look. Watch your fingers! Writing all\
  \ the Goblins in <em>Munchkin Pathfinder</em> and its expansions was fun and challenging,\
  \ and even now I find myself coming up with more Goblin ideas than I have space\
  \ to use them. (So far, anyway... no telling what the future might hold!)</p> \n\
  \    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/SJG4423-GoblinSweat.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/SJG4423-GoblinSweat_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Next up is Goblin Sweat. I admit, I wasn't thinking about\
  \ a bartender when I saw this Item in the Pathfinder books and included it in the\
  \ game, but I'm glad Shane did! It puts a new twist on an already fun item. (Pun\
  \ totally intended.)</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/SJG4423-Firegut.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/SJG4423-Firegut_180.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>Finally, Firegut is one of the many Curses in <em>Munchkin\
  \ Pathfinder</em> that I took from the various diseases found in Golarion. This\
  \ one is especially nasty in canon and Shane's art captures it perfectly. Special\
  \ kudos on this and all the cards in this set to the SJ Games layout and production\
  \ team; this game looks fantastic because of their hard work.</p> \n    <p>The <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy9kg8\"><em>Munchkin Pathfinder Guest Artist Edition</em></a>\
  \ is now available for order from paizo.com. Love goblins as much as us? Be sure\
  \ to look out for the upcoming <a href=\"/products/btpy9o7z\"><em>Truly Gobnoxious</em></a>\
  \ booster due next month!</p> \n    <p>Andrew Hackard<br> <i>Munchkin Line Editor</i></p>\
