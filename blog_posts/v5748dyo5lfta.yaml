  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">by Josh Vogt</p> \n   <h2>Chapter 2: Foes by Firelight</h2>\
  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">Aberny\
  \ gaped at the body for a moment, blood staining the earth at his feet. Then the\
  \ scene around the campfire snatched his stare away.</span></p> \n    <p>The chimera\
  \ crouched on the far side of the fire, a guard pinned and twitching beneath its\
  \ massive forepaws. One of the servants crawled for the trees. Entrails dragged\
  \ from a horrible gash along his side.</p> \n    <p>Leathery wings tucked back along\
  \ the chimera's body as muscles bunched for another attack. Its three heads wove\
  \ independently—a maned lion's, a horned goat's, and a green dragon's. Each set\
  \ of eyes gleamed with a putrid yellow-green light, alive with vicious hunger. Triple\
  \ maws drooled in anticipation of a feast. The lion snarled, while the dragon puffed\
  \ an emerald haze that sizzled as it plumed over the fire. Acid, Aberny realized.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>He nearly ducked back inside, but he'd not built his reputation on cowardice.\
  \ Taking up a knobbed walking staff from beside the tent flap, he emerged and grasped\
  \ it in both hands. A gasp drew his glance aside to Tali, who'd poked her head out\
  \ from her tent, and sketched furiously on a parchment.</p> \n    <p>Then the chimera—\
  roaring, screeching, and bleating—lunged at the second guard, who'd tried to circle\
  \ around to flank it in the brush. A sweep of a paw and wing knocked the man back\
  \ and the sword flew from his hands.</p> \n    <p>Ralynn dove in from the other\
  \ side, a wordless battle cry erupting from him.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\"\

  \  <br>Ralynn combines the ferocity and grace of his half-elven heritage.\n    </div>\
  \ \n    <p>Aberny never knew such an immense beast could move so fast. It snapped\
  \ its lion fangs while trying to gore the fighter with its goat horns. At the same\
  \ time, the dragon head curled back around to spew another stream of acid onto the\
  \ hapless guard. The man's screams wrenched Aberny's guts, but there was nothing\
  \ he could do.</p> \n    <p>Wielding two short swords, the half-elf had to get in\
  \ close to do any damage, putting himself within range of wings, talons, and fangs.\
  \ The chimera lashed with its bared claws while snapping at Ralynn from several\
  \ directions at once. The fighter evaded the bites, but one claw stuck him across\
  \ a shoulder and sent him tumbling.</p> \n    <p>Ralynn rolled through the blow\
  \ and back up to his feet, swords readied. The dragon head clamped down on the guard's\
  \ body and flung it through the air at the fighter.</p> \n    <p>Even as Ralynn\
  \ dodged, the beast pounced, leaping through the flames of the campfire. The stink\
  \ of burning fur filled the air as its hind legs trampled the blaze, and the beast's\
  \ roar shook the shadows themselves. Burning logs scattered about, casting just\
  \ enough residual light to limn the fight in a red glow.</p> \n    <p>Ralynn hurtled\
  \ forward, swords raised. As the chimera pounced, he tucked and rolled, trailing\
  \ a slash at its belly. The chimera yowled and threw up chunks of grassy earth as\
  \ it dug in and reversed course.</p> \n    <p>Aberny lunged and swung his staff,\
  \ trying to distract it so Ralynn might get in a solid blow. The unsatisfying thump\
  \ on the creature's hind side only served to irritate the beast, which sideswiped\
  \ with a paw, while the goat's head jerked toward the merchant. He threw himself\
  \ aside, almost crushing Tali, who yelped and rolled out of the way at the last\
  \ instant.</p> \n    <p>She hurried to his side and tugged at his robe. Aberny lurched\
  \ to his feet, fearing the chimera might decide to eliminate the two unarmed party\
  \ members.</p> \n    <p>But Ralynn had reengaged, combining the ferocity and grace\
  \ of his mixed parentage. Blades flashed in the light of dying embers as he turned\
  \ the chimera away from the others, expertly rushing in and twisting aside before\
  \ it could land another blow. However, he couldn't maneuver for any serious strike.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The horses had already gone near-mad in their proximity to the chimera,\
  \ and their efforts to escape only grew more frantic as the creature dove into their\
  \ midst. In a frenzy of teeth and talons, the beast laid several of the hapless\
  \ pack animals low, while two others at last tore loose and galloped off.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Then the poisonous green gaze of all three heads locked back on the companions,\
  \ who could only watch in dismay. Three voices spoke in unison, each a bestial utterance\
  \ that tortured Aberny's ears. He'd traveled widely enough to recognize the language\
  \ of dragons, but didn't speak any of it.</p> \n    <p>Ralynn winced as well. \"\
  What's it growling about?\"</p> \n    <p>Tali perked up. \"It says to be happy it's\
  \ already feasted tonight, but it'll be hungry again tomorrow and has our scent.\
  \ Also, it called you a weakling coward.\"</p> \n    <p>Aberny raised an eyebrow\
  \ her way. She knew its language?</p> \n    <p>Ralynn flourished a sword. \"Drop\
  \ in for lunch and I'll have your heads for trophies.\"</p> \n    <p>The chimera\
  \ snarled at Ralynn's challenge. Then, with a final chuff, its leonine head snatched\
  \ up the one of the servants' bodies. The creature spun about and charged into the\
  \ darkness. Moments later, a flap of enormous wings indicated it had taken flight.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The survivors studied the starry sky for several minutes, ensuring the\
  \ beast didn't intend an immediate return and ambush. Then Ralynn glared at the\
  \ few dribbles of blood on his blade and headed for the nearest brush where he wiped\
  \ it clean.</p> \n    <p>\"Well, you two were useless,\" he said over a shoulder.\
  \ \"Try running screaming into the night with the horses next time and at least\
  \ provide a distraction.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Useless?\" Tali shot back. \"I interpreted\
  \ its warning, didn't I? That's doing plenty. Want me to fight for you? Then offer\
  \ me your share of the reward. Didn't you say there was no sign of the creature\
  \ around when we camped. Piss-poor tracking! Certainly let our guard down. How'd\
  \ it know we were here?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Beyond our fire and earlier noisy arguing?\"\
  \ Aberny shook his head. \"It must've caught detected us while prowling about.\"\
  \ He frowned at the corpses. \"It took the most vulnerable first.\"</p> \n    <p>Ralynn\
  \ scowled at Tali. \"Then why's she still here?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Because!\" Tali\
  \ lifted her chin. \"Even a chimera is more perceptive than you when it comes to\
  \ strength of spirit. Maybe if you had three heads, you'd have enough brains to—\
  \"</p> \n    <p>Aberny flung his arms wide. \"Enough. The beast caught us off guard\
  \ and marked us for later. Can we focus on that?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Dumb boasts,\"\
  \ Ralynn said. \"In a fair fight, it doesn't stand a chance against me.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"Chimeras don't fight fair,\" Tali said. \"And they're wickedly cunning.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"What do you know?\" asked Ralynn.</p> \n    <p>The gnome tapped\
  \ her cheek with a silver-painted nail. \"Much! Most chimeras live in prides, hunting\
  \ in groups to outnumber prey. This one could be a younger male or an outcast, and\
  \ hunting more aggressively as it tries to establish dominance of its chosen territory.\
  \ Oh, and they like shiny things!\"</p> \n    <p>Aberny eyed her. \"How've you learned\
  \ all this?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Besides everyone around town talking for the past few\
  \ weeks since the first deaths?\" Tali drew herself up. \"I always—always!—study\
  \ my subjects in-depth. It's the only way I can properly convey their essence through\
  \ my pieces.\"</p> \n    <p>\"You learned the tongue of dragons in a few weeks?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>She sniffed. \"Of course not. Languages are a form of art. I've immersed\
  \ myself in many of them over the years.\"</p> \n    <p>\"What of you, Aberny? With\
  \ your investments...\" Ralynn indicated the bodies with a flick of his eyes, \"\
  not paying off, want to renegotiate?\"</p> \n    <p>Aberny hitched his shoulders\
  \ back, trying to project his usual confidence, which had alarmingly fled. He'd\
  \ thought himself sturdier than this. \"The hunt continues.\" He slumped again.\
  \ \"But first, let's respect the dead.\"</p> \n    <p>They found a patch of soft\
  \ earth and Aberny procured a small shovel from the supplies his deceased servants\
  \ had brought along. Ralynn dug four shallow graves, and then they dragged the fallen\
  \ over one by one. Tali surprised them by joining in, though she took care to only\
  \ grab the bodies where blood or bile hadn't marred them.</p> \n    <p>Aberny and\
  \ Ralynn took turns shoveling dirt over the holes, even though it proved more manual\
  \ labor than the merchant had experienced in a long while. He'd sweated through\
  \ his robe by the time he stopped to pray Desna's blessing, wishing the dead good\
  \ fortune in the afterlife for their loyal—if short—service.</p> \n    <p>Ralynn\
  \ rebuilt the fire and claimed the watch for the rest of the night, but the other\
  \ two didn't return to their tents. Tali claimed inspiration for a piece she called\
  \ \"Foe by Firelight\" left her too roused to sleep, though Aberny noted she kept\
  \ well within the circle of firelight and sat a bit closer to the fighter than before.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>For himself, Aberny settled on his stool and sipped wine to soothe his\
  \ nerves, while pondering this ill turn of fortune. How could he, bereft of his\
  \ guards, expect to triumph over such a vicious beast? He'd underestimated the creature,\
  \ since reports had it picking off one or two victims alone. Now it appeared emboldened\
  \ and loath to spare any threats to its territory.</p> \n    <p>Yet he'd always\
  \ found a way to turn even the most dire circumstances to his benefit. This time,\
  \ though, it wasn't just about recouping losses. If he considered the chimera a\
  \ bandit as well as a beast, it put things in the proper perspective. It hadn't\
  \ just attacked their party. It had robbed him, specifically; and no merchant worth\
  \ his abacus allowed thievery without consequences.</p> \n    <p>He slugged back\
  \ the last of the wine in silent oath to himself. So be it.</p> \n    <p>The scratching\
  \ of Tali's sketching nibbled at his ears until just an hour before dawn, when she\
  \ gave an enormous yawn and slumped, snoring against Ralynn's side. The fighter\
  \ sighed, but didn't push her away. As the sun lit a candle on the horizon, Aberny\
  \ rubbed his eyes, wishing he could follow the gnome to rest, but knowing it'd be\
  \ a futile effort.</p> \n    <p>Once morning rose in full, he made them a quick,\
  \ cold breakfast. Ralynn gulped his down and then jostled Tali awake for her portion,\
  \ which she took with a grimace. Then they debated what to do with the tents and\
  \ equipment.</p> \n    <p>\"Leave it,\" Aberny decided, \"except for any food we\
  \ can carry. If the creature plans to return, we might not need to go far before\
  \ picking up its trail. And we don't want to be overburdened if it ambushes us.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>As the others prepared to head out, Aberny retrieved his staff, and\
  \ then—after a moment's thought—took up one of the swords from a fallen guard.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Ralynn raised a slim eyebrow. \"Planning to use that?\"</p> \n    <p>Aberny\
  \ gave an experimental swing, trying to awaken long unused arm muscles. \"I was\
  \ a caravan guard once, long ago. I didn't leave that profession entirely unscarred.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"You?\" Tali asked, goggling.</p> \n    <p>He grunted. \"During a\
  \ trip through Cheliax, our caravan was ambushed by orcs. I alone survived, managing\
  \ to get most of the goods to Kintargo in the aftermath. I then established my name\
  \ based on my former master's reputation. Turned out I had an even better knack\
  \ for it than he ever did.\" He tucked the sword into his robe's belt and thrust\
  \ his staff toward the hills. \"Onward?\"</p> \n    <p>Ralynn smirked. \"Still willing\
  \ to brave the danger?\"</p> \n    <p>\"By all means. When it slaughtered my men,\
  \ the chimera made this business rather... personal.\"</p> \n    <p align=\"center\"\
