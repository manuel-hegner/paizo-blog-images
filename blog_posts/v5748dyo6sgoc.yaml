  ><em>Lost Omens World Guide</em></a>, releasing in August, this week we take a look\
  \ at the Broken Lands. This region occupies the northeastern corner of Avistan,\
  \ consisting of Brevoy, Mendev, Numeria, Razmiran, the River Kingdoms, and the Sarkoris\
  \ Scar (what used to be the Worldwound). While many parts of the world could be\
  \ described as \"broken,\" this region is particularly scarred by political upheaval,\
  \ war, and demonic invasion. Player characters in these lands are likely to find\
  \ rival factions competing for control of a government on the edge of collapse,\
  \ open conflict between opposing city- or nation-states, or the remnants of the\
  \ Abyssal horde now cut off from their demonic home plane and stranded in a world\
  \ no longer focused on eradicating the threat they present.</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  \ Absalom, which we examined last week, there have been several adventure paths\
  \ and standalone modules set in the Broken Lands whose outcomes we've canonically\
  \ codified into the second edition status quo. Among these are Iron Gods, Kingmaker,\
  \ and Wrath of the Righteous.</p> \n    <p>In Numeria, the Technic League has fallen\
  \ from power, leaving Black Sovereign, Kevoth-Kul to kick his addiction to the mind-muddling\
  \ drugs they'd been feeding him for years all on his own. What erratic behavior\
  \ may come from the throes of withdrawal, and what political factions may vie to\
  \ replace the league as the power behind the throne remains to be seen. Perhaps\
  \ the adherents of the new goddess, Casandalee, will play a role?</p> \n    <div\

  \    </div> \n    <p>In the River Kingdoms, a new nation rose in the Stolen Lands\
  \ (conveniently left unnamed so that the kingdom you created in your Kingmaker campaign\
  \ doesn't invalidate canon) and overtook Pitax.</p> \n    <p>In neighboring Brevoy,\
  \ a king left at the altar has brought the lands of Issia and Rostland closer to\
  \ war than ever before. Meanwhile, the previously abandoned and sealed Skywatch\
  \ presents a new mystery for adventurers uninterested in the feuds of the nation's\
  \ noble houses.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderLostOmens/20190604-Lander.jpg\"\

  \ Galfrey of Mendev, kept alive with sun orchid elixir to ensure constant leadership\
  \ against the agents of the Abyss, has been given a well-earned retirement, and\
  \ has left the nation in the capable hands of Chancellor Irahai. The end of the\
  \ Mendevian Crusades, however, has left the nation without purpose or common threat,\
  \ and the chancellor has her work cut out for her in unifying the people to foster\
  \ a national culture long overshadowed by the threat of war and legions of foreign\
  \ crusaders calling the northern land home.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ was formerly the Worldwound—closed when mythic heroes defeated the demon lord\
  \ Deskari—demons still lay claim to the tainted wasteland. While before they could\
  \ count on endless reinforcements from the heart of the Abyss, the surviving demons\
  \ and cultists are now cut off from their home plane and desperate to survive. The\
  \ native Sarkorians who once called the land home have begun to return and reclaim\
  \ their ancestral homeland, but they won't find its current inhabitants particularly\
  \ welcoming. With the help of remnant crusaders not yet turned south to face the\
  \ rising threat of the Whispering Tyrant and the strange outsiders that the Sarkorians\
  \ call their gods, perhaps they can heal the Sarkoris Scar and make it into a stable,\
  \ fertile land once again.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderLostOmens/20190604-Scar.jpg\"\

  \ Razmiran, once merely a River Kingdom and now a nation in its own right, life\
  \ continues as it did before the Whispering Tyrant's escape, its citizens taking\
  \ solace in the knowledge that their land is protected by a benevolent deity, Razmir.\
  \ The Living God has not opposed the Whispering Tyrant and a constant stream of\
  \ \"donated\" corpses to the lich's armies has ensured a tenuous peace between the\
  \ two powers.</p> \n    <p>This chapter of the <em>Lost Omens World Guide</em> presents\
  \ seven new character backgrounds and the Aldori duelist archetype, which allows\
  \ player characters to master the iconic dueling style of Brevoy's Aldori swordlords!</p>\
