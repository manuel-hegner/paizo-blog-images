  \ </div> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Spells are magical formulas with esoteric\
  \ components, including words of power, gestures, and unusual ingredients, that\
  \ when taken together create extraordinary magical effects. Spells have always been\
  \ a crucial part of Pathfinder and the fantasy genre as a whole. But what's new\
  \ about spells in the playtest? Let's take a look!</p> \n     <h2>Action!</h2> \n\
  \     <p>You cast spells by using some combination of the Verbal Casting, Somatic\
  \ Casting, and Material Casting actions (the most common combination is Verbal and\
  \ Somatic Casting actions for 2 total actions). Not every class interfaces with\
  \ those actions in the same way. For instance, clerics can use a divine focus to\
  \ satisfy the Material Casting action, sorcerers use their magical blood, and bards\
  \ can use instruments that change up several aspects (for instance, even if you're\
  \ gagged or otherwise unable to speak, you can play your violin to provide the Verbal\
  \ Casting portion).</p> \n     <h2>Heightened Spells</h2> \n     <p>In the playtest,\
  \ you'll be able to heighten your favorite spells in order to gain greater effects\
  \ than ever before. Heightening a spell works much like it did previously, where\
  \ you prepare a spell in a higher-level slot (or cast it using a higher-level slot\
  \ if you're a spontaneous caster), except now all spellcasters can do it, and you\
  \ gain much more interesting benefits. Want to fire 15 missiles with <i>magic missile</i>\
  \ or turn into a Huge animal with <i>animal form</i>? Just heighten those spells\
  \ to the appropriate level! There's no longer any need to learn long chains of spells\
  \ that are incrementally different and each require you to refer back to the previous\
  \ spell.</p> \n     <p>Incidentally, the idea of using a spell's level to determine\
  \ its power has led to some really interesting interplay between spells. For example,\
  \ how many times have you run into a situation where your high-level illusionist\
  \ is foiled by a simple <i>detect magic</i> spell or a similar effect? Now, illusions\
  \ of a higher spell level than a <i>detect magic</i> cantrip can foil detection!\
  \ Similarly, <i>dispel magic</i> has a harder time dispelling spells of much higher\
  \ spell levels, while it can crush lower-level spells with ease. This extends to\
  \ many other similar interactions; while in Pathfinder First Edition, a creature\
  \ with some basic spell effect that's constantly active might be flat-out immune\
  \ to your character's spells, now you can heighten your spells and overcome that\
  \ obstacle!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb360\">\n      <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20180416-GnomeSpellcaster.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20180416-GnomeSpellcaster_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n      <p><i>Illustration by Wayne Reynolds</i></p>\n     </div> \n     <h2>Cantrips</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>In the playtest, cantrips are spells you can cast at will, but they\
  \ are no longer level 0. Instead, they automatically heighten to the highest spell\
  \ level you can currently cast. That means if you're 5th level, your <i>ray of frost</i>\
  \ is 3rd level and deals more damage, and your <i>light</i> cantrip is better at\
  \ counteracting magical darkness.</p> \n     <h2>Domain Powers and Beyond</h2> \n\
  \     <p>Pathfinder has always had domain powers, school powers, bloodline powers,\
  \ and other special class-based spell-like abilities that you can use a certain\
  \ number of times per day rather than using your daily spell slots on them. In the\
  \ playtest, we've expanded this idea, allowing even more classes to gain these kinds\
  \ of powers and standardizing the way we talk about the powers and their daily uses.\
  \ The powers are now treated as a special kind of spell, and they are all cast using\
  \ Spell Points. There is power in naming something; while you don't really count\
  \ them differently than if you had a pool of uses per day, this allowed us to create\
  \ new and interesting abilities that cost multiple Spell Points or that you could\
  \ add extra features to at the cost of more Spell Points, in a way that works across\
  \ classes more smoothly.</p> \n     <h2>10th-Level Spells</h2> \n     <p>So what's\
  \ the deal with 10th-level spells? Jason mentioned these all the way at the beginning,\
  \ and many of you have given excellent guesses for what they will be. They start\
  \ with a class of spells that used to be 9th level+, by which I mean, they were\
  \ 9th level, but even for that level they were usually balanced by expensive material\
  \ costs. Spells like wish and miracle. In the playtest, these spells are free to\
  \ cast but are 10th level. Then we added some brand-new and amazing spells, like\
  \ <i>fabricated truth</i> and <i>nature incarnate</i>. I'm guessing you guys will\
  \ quickly figure out what these spells do, but here's a hint: one of them had a\
  \ critical failure effect previewed in the <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkod?Critical-Hits-and-Critical-Failures\"\
  >Critical Hits and Critical Failures blog</a>!</p> \n     <h2>Rituals</h2> \n  \
  \   <p>Ever since we introduced them in <em>Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures</em>,\
  \ rituals have been a favorite both among fans and the adventure developers here\
  \ at Paizo. If you haven't checked them out yet, they're story-rich spells with\
  \ a long casting time that anyone skilled enough could conceivably try to perform\
  \ as long as they have the hidden knowledge. Typically they involve some number\
  \ of secondary casters, which can get the whole party involved or make a nice set-piece\
  \ encounter with an evil cult.</p> \n     <p>Even in the <em>Pathfinder RPG Core\
  \ Rulebook</em>, there were spells that sort of followed that mold alreadyâ€”the 8th-level\
  \ spell binding is a perfect example. In the playtest, these sorts of spells have\
  \ been made into rituals. This means that these downtime spells don't take up your\
  \ spell slots, and that martial characters who manage to attain a high enough proficiency\
  \ rank in magic-related skills like Arcana can cast them! This is particularly great\
  \ when, for instance, the cleric dies but the monk can perform a <i>resurrection</i>\
  \ ritual. (Don't worry, there is still also the non-ritual spell <i>raise dead</i>\
  \ in case you need someone back in action faster, though a group that wants death\
  \ to be more uncertain can easily omit that spell for an instant shift in the tone\
  \ of the campaign.) Rituals also have delightful potential failure effects. For\
  \ instance, if you critically fail <i>planar binding</i>, you call something dark\
  \ and horrible that isn't bound by your wards, and it immediately attempts to destroy\
  \ you!</p> \n     <h2>Magical Traditions</h2> \n     <p>Magical traditions, such\
  \ as arcane and divine, have always been a part of Pathfinder spells. But the playtest\
  \ gives us an opportunity to really explore what they mean, what makes them different,\
  \ and how they metaphysically interconnect in a way that enriches the game's story.\
  \ Magic taps into various essences in the cosmos. For example, arcane magic blends\
  \ material essence (the fundamental building blocks of all physical things) and\
  \ mental essence (the building block of rational thoughts, logic, and memories).\
  \ This means that arcane traditions share a lot in common with science, as arcane\
  \ spellcasters tend to use logic and rational methods to categorize the magic inherent\
  \ in the physical world around them. Divine magic is the exact opposite; it blends\
  \ spiritual essence (the otherworldly building block of the immortal self) and vital\
  \ essence (the universal life force that gives us instincts and intuition). This\
  \ means that divine traditions are steeped in faith, the unseen, and belief in a\
  \ power source from beyond the Material Plane. These ideas have led to some exciting\
  \ new additions of spells into each tradition's repertoire.</p> \n     <h2>Example\
  \ Spells</h2> \n     <p>Let's put everything we've talked about into perspective\
  \ by taking a look at a spell that can be heightened and that uses actions in an\
  \ interesting way: <i>heal</i>. (By the way, notice the new spell school!)</p> \n\
  \     <blockquote> \n      <div class=\"stat-block\"> \n       <p class=\"stat-block-title\"\
  >Heal <span class=\"stat-block-cr\">Spell 1</span></p> \n       <p class=\"stat-block-1\"\
  ><b>Healing, Necromancy, Positive</b><br> <b>Casting</b> Somatic Casting or more<br>\
  \ <b>Range</b> touch, <b>Range</b> 30 feet, or <b>Area</b> 30-foot aura (see text);\
  \ <b>Target</b> one willing living creature or one undead creature</p> \n      \
  \ <p>You channel positive energy to heal the living or damage the undead. You restore\
  \ Hit Points equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting modifier to a willing living target,\
  \ or deal that amount of positive damage to an undead target. The number of actions\
  \ you spend when Casting this Spell determines its targets, range, area, and other\
  \ parameters.</p> \n       <ul>\n        <li><b>Somatic Casting</b> The spell has\
  \ a range of touch. You must succeed at a melee touch attack to damage an undead\
  \ target.</li> \n        <li><b>Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting</b> The spell has\
  \ a range of 30 feet and doesn't require a touch attack when targeting an undead\
  \ creature. An undead target must attempt a Fortitude save, taking half damage on\
  \ a success, no damage on a critical success, or double damage on a critical failure.</li>\
  \ \n        <li><b>Material Casting, Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting</b> You disperse\
  \ positive energy in a 30-foot aura. This has the same effect as the two-action\
  \ version of the spell, but it targets all living and undead creatures in the burst\
  \ and reduces the amount of healing or damage to your spellcasting ability modifier.</li>\n\
  \       </ul> \n       <p><b>Heightened (+1)</b> Increase the amount of healing\
  \ or damage by 1d8, or by 2d8 if you're using the one- or two-action version to\
  \ heal the living.</p> \n      </div> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>So you can\
  \ cast <i>heal</i> with 1 action and restore quite a few Hit Points to a touched\
  \ target, especially for a single action. This is particularly useful if you cast\
  \ heal several times in one turn on someone who needs emergency assistance after\
  \ a critical hit! For 2 actions, you can cast safely from the back lines, and for\
  \ 3 actions, you can change the area to a burst and heal living creatures while\
  \ harming undead at the same time. It restores fewer hit points to each target that\
  \ way, but if you have multiple allies in need of healing, it can be really efficient.\
  \ This one spell, using heightened effects, combines the effects of all the <i>cure\
  \ wounds</i> spells in one place.</p> \n     <p>At the bottom of the stat block,\
  \ you see what one type of heightened entry looks like. This one gets better proportionally\
  \ for each spell level above 1st. So a 2nd-level <i>heal</i> spell heals one target\
  \ for 3d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier, a 3rd-level one heals one target\
  \ 5d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier, and so on.</p> \n     <p>But <i>heal</i>\
  \ is a classic spell chain that you already knew and loved in Pathfinder First Edition\
  \ and that has already been revealed in tidbits through podcasts. How about its\
  \ big sister <i>regenerate</i>?</p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <div class=\"stat-block\"\
  > \n       <p class=\"stat-block-title\">Regenerate <span class=\"stat-block-cr\"\
  >Spell 7</span></p> \n       <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Healing, Necromancy</b><br>\
  \ <b>Casting</b> Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting<br> <b>Range</b> touch; <b>Target</b>\
  \ one willing living creature<br> <b>Duration</b> 1 minute</p> \n       <p>The target\
  \ temporarily gains regeneration 15, which restores 15 Hit Points to it at the start\
  \ of each of its turns. While it has regeneration, the target can't die from damage\
  \ and its dying value can't exceed 3. If the target takes acid or fire damage, its\
  \ regeneration deactivates until after the end of its next turn.</p> \n       <p>Each\
  \ time the creature regains Hit Points from regeneration, it also regrows one damaged\
  \ or ruined organ (if any). During the spell's duration, the creature can also reattach\
  \ severed body parts by spending an Interact action to hold the body part to the\
  \ stump.</p> \n       <p><b>Heightened (9th)</b> The regeneration increases to 20.</p>\
  \ \n      </div> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p><i>Regenerate</i> was always necessary\
  \ to restore lost limbs or organs (a rare situation to come up in the game), but\
  \ the way it worked made it fairly ineffective for use in combat. This version is\
  \ much more attractive during a fight, particularly if your foe lacks access to\
  \ acid and fire!</p> \n     <p>This spell doesn't increase in power incrementally\
  \ as its level increases (except for being harder to dispel); instead, it has a\
  \ specific heightened benefit at 9th level.</p> \n     <p>But what about something\
  \ you've never seen before? Let's take a look at <i>vampiric exsanguination</i>!</p>\
  \ \n     <blockquote> \n      <div class=\"stat-block\"> \n       <p class=\"stat-block-title\"\
  >Vampiric Exsanguination <span class=\"stat-block-cr\">Spell 6</span></p> \n   \
  \    <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Death, Necromancy, Negative</b><br> <b>Casting</b>\
  \ Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting<br> <b>Area</b> 30-foot cone</p> \n       <p>You\
  \ draw life force from creatures and send it into your outstretched arms. You deal\
  \ 10d6 negative damage to all living creatures in the area. As long as at least\
  \ one creature in the area takes damage, you also gain half that many temporary\
  \ Hit Points. You lose any remaining temporary Hit Points after 1 minute.</p> \n\
  \       <ul style=\"list-style: none;\">\n        <li><b>Success</b> Half damage.</li>\
  \ \n        <li><b>Critical Success</b> No damage.</li> \n        <li><b>Failure\
  \ Full</b> damage.</li> \n        <li><b>Critical Failure</b> Double damage.</li>\n\
  \       </ul> \n       <p><b>Heightened (+2)</b> Increase the damage by 3d6.</p>\
  \ \n      </div> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>So we're dealing some reasonable\
  \ damage in a cone; <i>cone of cold</i> isn't going to be jealous. But the trick\
  \ here is that if you can get at least one foe (or minion) to critically fail its\
  \ save against the spell, you gain a huge number of temporary Hit Points! If you're\
  \ a wizard with a Constitution score of 12, that hapless creature might just provide\
  \ you nearly 50% more Hit Points (incidentally, if you deal a lot of damage, you\
  \ could kill a minion who critically fails the save, so use it responsibly). And\
  \ since you're drawing in life force, guess who gains access to this spell? (Urgathoans\
  \ rejoice!)</p> \n     <h2>More New Spells</h2> \n     <p>I'm going to close out\
  \ by giving just the names of a smattering of new spells. What might they do? I'll\
  \ leave it up to you guys to see what you think! </p>\n     <ul>\n      <li><i>Alter\
