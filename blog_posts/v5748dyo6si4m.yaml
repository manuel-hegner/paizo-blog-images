  \ with Everybody Games, Paizo, Rogue Genius Games, and on Pathfinder Infinite. He's\

  \ \n     <br> \n     <p><b>Dylan Wokeck</b><br> Dylan loves helping others as a\
  \ children's librarian, but when he’s not at work, he tries to spend as much time\
  \ as possible with his wife, whether that’s going for walks or playing games together.\
  \ She loves to take Dylan on real-life adventures to different states and countries.\
  \ Outside of that, Dylan has been playing Pathfinder since about 2015, and he still\
  \ can't decide if monk or bard is his favorite class. Dylan thanks his wife for\
  \ helping with the layout template for Google Docs and Dustin Knight for doing his\
  \ review show to keep Dylan motivated enough to write more Pathfinder content.</p>\
  \ \n     <br> \n     <p><b>Kevin Glusing</b><br> While having heard of them, Kevin\
  \ didn't actually play any TTRPGs until college in 2002, but he's always been a\
  \ world builder and problem solver. After being introduced to D&amp;D 3e by some\
  \ new friends, he took up the mantle of GM and never looked back. Almost 20 years\
  \ later, he works with Hal Greenberg, Doug Herring, and Ken Shannon of Samurai Sheepdog\
  \ (<a href=\"http://www.samuraisheepdog.com\">www.samuraisheepdog.com</a>) as Lead\
  \ RPG Designer with over 80 published credits to his name and over 120 overall in\
  \ which he's had some significant part. Kevin also hosts a successful Patreon (<a\
  \ href=\"https://www.patreon.com/namesgames\">www.patreon.com/namesgames</a>) with\
  \ 4 years of successful releases and requests.</p> \n     <br> \n     <p><b>Tom\
  \ Robinson</b><br> Tom Robinson lives in the wildlands of Los Angeles. An eternal\
  \ GM, he has played a wide variety of roleplaying games hailing back to the 1970s.\
  \ As an amateur content creator, he has written materials for Paizo, Monte Cook\
  \ Games, and Schwalb Entertainment, available on DriveThruRPG and Pathfinder Infinite.\
  \ Tom is a theatrical director and acting teacher and works with the American Academy\
  \ of Dramatic Arts and the Utah Shakespeare Festival. He is a proud member of the\
  \ Stage Directors and Choreographers Society. He is \"staff\" to a precocious and\
  \ adorable smooth fox terrier named Abigail Pippington.</p> \n     <br> \n     <p><b>W.\
  \ Brian Lane</b><br> W. Brian Lane is a physics educator by day and a Pathfinder\
  \ GM and content creator by night. He first played Pathfinder in 2015 and has been\
  \ running and creating adventures ever since. He has self-published <a href=\"\"\
  >a novel about his first multi-year campaign</a>. Publishing Pathfinder content\
  \ under <a href=\"\">Lion's Brain Media</a>, he loves creating <a href=\"\">archetypes</a>\
  \ and writing <a href=\"\">multi-level adventures</a>. His <a href=\"\">Inkfinder</a>\
  \ has been ranked copper on Pathfinder Infinite, and he has been a finalist in RPG\
  \ SuperStar for two years. You can also find his physics and coding content at <a\

  \ Arkon is a college student with just enough time to run and create for Pathfinder.\
  \ When he finds some extra between the couch cushions, Arkon explores different\
  \ interests, editions, and media to pull from for inspiration. Most of what he makes\
  \ are player options, such as classes, archetypes, spells, subclasses, etc. But\
  \ as a Forever GM, Arkon also finds himself making things he finds missing. Certified\
  \ oracle main and unashamed homebrew setting enthusiast.<br> Arkon’s Infinite portfolio:\
