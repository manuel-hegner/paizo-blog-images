  \   <blockquote> \n    <h1>Karzoug Defeated</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Tuesdasy,\
  \ December 28, 2010</p> \n    <p>After almost three years of gaming every Wednesday\
  \ evening, the six players in my weekly Pathfinder game finally defeated the Runelord\
  \ Karzoug and saved Varisia from almost certain devastation. Not only did my group\
  \ defeat a pesty group of goblins, solve the Skinsaw murders, recapture Fort Rannick,\
  \ discover who was behind the stone giant uprisings, find the Runeforge and then\
  \ Xin-Shalast, and finally defeat Karzoug and his minions, but they also transitioned\
  \ from D&amp;D 3.5 to the Pathfinder Beta and eventually to the Pathfinder RPG.\
  \ One of my gamers, Jamie Fristrom, loved to tell his young daughter Sofi the tales\
  \ we spun each week, and she got so excited by the tales that she had her father\
  \ help her build LEGO versions of all the characters. </p> \n    <p>Our adventuring\
  \ group, from left to right, starting in the front row: </p> \n    <p>Sevashti,\
  \ Varisian sorceress played by Vic Wertz. Sevashti was the niece of Madame Mvashti\
  \ in Sandpoint, and she plied the Harrow cards as well as she plied her spells.\
  \ </p> \n    <p>Elena Foxglove, of the Absalom branch of the Foxgloves, rogue extraordinaire.\
  \ </p> \n    <p>Marbury Foxglove, foppish cleric of Cayden Cailean, also of the\
  \ Absalom Foxgloves. </p> \n    <p>Elsid, ranger, who was raised by the Shoanti\
  \ when his parents were killed by giants. Blood brother to... </p> \n    <p>Karnack,\
  \ Shoanti barbarian, who ended the campaign with two wives and two children, with\
  \ his eyes firmly set on a third. </p> \n    <p>Jamek, half-orc druid, with his\
  \ faithful tiger companion Furball (companion not pictured). </p> \n    <p>Bonus\
  \ points if you can figure out what Jamek is holding in his left hand.</p> \n  \
  \  <p>Now that Varisia is safe, our group is running Kingmaker and trying to establish\
  \ a kingdom in the wilds of the Stolen Lands. Stay tuned for stories of Tazbo (halfling\
  \ paladin of Desna), Sifroth (human cleric of Nethys), Asti and Tao (half-elven\
  \ summoner and eidolon), Sabriel (elven witch), Ergum (dwarven inquisitor of Desna),\
  \ and Anton (human magus Aldori Swordlord). </p> \n    <p>Lisa Stevens <br>CEO</p>\
