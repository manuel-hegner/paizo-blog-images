  \ \n  <blockquote> \n   <h1><br>Lansdale on Kline</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\"><br>Tuesday,\
  \ February 3, 2009</p> \n   <p>One of the greatest strengths of the <a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy7zxy\"\
  >Planet Stories</a> book line is that, in addition to republishing SF classics by\
  \ some brilliant and historically significant authors, we have the chance to get\
  \ <i>other</i> amazing authors to introduce them. People like <a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy81tw\"\
  >F. Paul Wilson</a>, <a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy83x7\">George Lucas</a>,\
  \ <a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy7zdo\">C. J. Cherryh</a>, <a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy7zdr\"\
  >Ben Bova</a>, <a href=\" /planetStories/v5748btpy80hq\">Samuel R. Delany</a>â€”it\
  \ never fails to blow my mind every time I see their names in my email inbox. Through\
  \ their introductions, these authors get to contextualize the forgotten literary\
  \ heroes that influenced them most and help usher their teachers back into print,\
  \ the better to educate the next generation of science fiction and fantasy authors.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Which, really, makes me wonder why <i>I'm</i> saying anything at all about\
  \ these books, when I could get out of the way and let them do it for me. So without\
  \ further ado, here's an excerpt from Bubba Ho-Tep creator Joe R. Lansdale on why\
  \ <a href=\"/search?q=otis+adelbert+kline&amp;what=all\">Otis Adelbert Kline</a>'s\
  \ <a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy83x8\"><i>The Outlaws of Mars</i></a> deserves\
  \ to be in your shopping cart as we speak:</p> \n   <blockquote> \n    <p><a href=\"\
  /planetStories/v5748btpy83x8\"><i>The Outlaws of Mars</i></a> was written in the\
  \ thirties and appeared in <i>Argosy Weekly</i>. It is very much in the Burroughs\
  \ interplanetary format. A young American, Jerry Morgan, already skilled in the\
  \ ways of combat due to his time in the army, goes to the home of his uncle, Dr.\
  \ Morgan, and is after a little too much explanation about telepathy and machinery,\
  \ transported, via machine, to Mars. The reason for Jerry's departure is embarrassment\
  \ of a sort, having to do with a woman. Though the event is never fully explained,\
  \ it appears Jerry has allowed a lie about himself to exist to keep from compromising\
  \ the aforementioned young lady. So, our noble, romantic, and very Victorian hero\
  \ flees our world for one of adventure on Mars. Upon his arrival, there is enough\
  \ action for three novels: some court intrigue, treachery, weird inhabitants, sword\
  \ fighting, and one hot mama named Junia.</p> \n    <p>Frankly, the plot is of little\
  \ consequence, and is not dissimilar from those of the Burroughs novels, or of any\
  \ sword and planet adventure written by Kline himself. Movement is the name of the\
  \ game, and Kline provides that in the proverbial spades. There is hardly a moment\
  \ to breathe, and the only time the novel bogs down is when Kline tries to justify\
  \ his plot with too much explanation. When Kline is moving the story forward, bringing\
  \ on the action, keeping us tightly wrapped up in his warm and bloody dream, we\
  \ are with him all the way. It is only when he pauses to explain that the cocoon\
  \ we were so tightly wrapped in breaks open and we fall out.</p> \n    <p>These\
  \ moments are few, and Kline is more than willing to rewrap us, and we are more\
  \ than willing to let him. There is plenty of color and beauty and a sweeping approach\
  \ to story that reminds me of the cinema. In fact, with the popularity of such films\
  \ as <i>Star Wars</i> and Indiana Jones, I would have thought by now, considering\
  \ special effects have improved to the point of being almost as incredible as our\
  \ most astounding dreams, that Burroughs and possibly Kline's characters would have\
  \ been updated and filmed. Certainly, it's this color and sweep and majesty of background\
  \ that make these stories so damned appealing; they are like movies in the head.</p>\
