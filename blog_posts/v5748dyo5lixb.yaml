  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, July 5, 2016</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"\
  > \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Ever since we published <a href=\"\">Ranzak</a>\
  \ as the first promo character, goblin fever has surrounded the Pathfinder Adventure\
  \ Card Game. And now that we are almost ready to release two full goblin decks into\
  \ the wild, we can take a moment to peel back the (literal) veil on <a href=\"/products/btpy9jcw\"\
  ><em>Goblins Fight</em></a>!</p> \n    <p>The cast of characters include two faces\
  \ familiar to fans of the <a href=\"/pathfinder/modules/freeRPGDay\"><em>We Be Goblins</em>\
  \ Pathfinder Modules</a>: Reta, the female goblin commando with her stolen wedding\
  \ veil; and Chuffy, the male goblin knifer covered in exploding pustules. Rounding\
  \ out the triumvirate of fighting goblins is Ak, who comes to us from the fifth\
  \ issue of Dynamite's <a href=\"/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics/goblins\"\
  >Pathfinder Goblins!</a> comic. Ak is a male goblin runt with the most wretched\
  \ expression ever worn by a goblinâ€”this stems from his being average at fighting\
  \ and incompetent with magic, compared to his compatriots. Fortunately, he is blessed\
  \ by the goblin gods and can bring some well-timed assistance to the table.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6817-AkFront.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6817-AkFront_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a> <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6817-AkTokenFront.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6817-AkTokenFront_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>And what would the Licktoad goblins be without their\
  \ tribe's namesake? Each goblin has a pet frog ally that helps cause mayhem in the\
  \ most civilized setting. Chuffy carries Fat Frog, who is springy and sprongy like\
  \ our favorite sneaky goblin. Spotol accompanies Reta, strengthening her Constitution.\
  \ (Reta likes Spotol so much that she even gave him his own white veil!) Ak's favorite\
  \ toad, Redbutt, confers Strength on his owner. Everything is easier to face with\
  \ your pet at your side.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6817-Redbutt.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6817-Redbutt_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Illustration by Marko Horvatin</i>\n    </div> \n    <p><a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9jcw\"><em>Goblins Fight!</em></a> expands the choice of blessings.\
  \ Many of the new blessings feature cool stained-glass art, including Blessing of\
  \ the Boss, Blessing of Lady Lastbreath, and Blessing of Bark Breaker. Of course,\
  \ what would a goblin deck be without a blessing just for them? Blessing of the\
  \ Gobs is all you would expect: helpful to goblins; painful and chaotic for others.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6817-BlessingOfTheGobs.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6817-BlessingOfTheGobs_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>The deck includes a good smattering of weapons, spells,\
  \ armors, and items to help the goblins on their path to world domination. Well,\
  \ maybe not enough to take over the world, or even the county, but enough to put\
  \ them at the top of the goblin heap. And in case they get hungry on the way, we\
  \ offer up some pickles!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\
  //static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6817-GoblinPickles.jpg\"><img\
  \ src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6817-GoblinPickles_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>So come try out the new <a href=\"/products/btpy9jcw\"\
  ><em>Goblins Fight!</em> Deck</a>, releasing at Gen Con 2016 and at game stores\
  \ on August 4. Inject some serious mayhem into the Season of the Runelords with\
  \ Chuffy, Reta, and Ak in <a href=\"/pfsacg\">Pathfinder Adventure Card Guild</a>\
  \ play or send them to the Shackles in Skull &amp; Shackles, to the Worldwound in\
  \ Wrath of the Righteous, or home to Sandpoint in Rise of the Runelords. And in\
  \ October, you can try out their tomb-raiding skills in Mummy's Mask!</p> \n   \
  \ <p>Check back next week when we preview the <a href=\"/products/btpy9k5m\"><em>Goblins\
  \ Burn!</em></a> deck!</p> \n    <p>Tonya Woldridge<br> <i>Organized Play Coordinator</i></p>\
