  \ time to blog!</p> \n    <p>As we all know, the business environment changed radically\
  \ when the Internet achieved sentience back in '03. Suddenly, the clean, predictable\
  \ world of code became a tangled, heaving jungle of logic chains and creeping ads.\
  \ Companies suddenly found themselves in want of both a competent programmer and\
  \ an experienced survival expert. Luckily, Paizo has both.</p> \n    <p>This week\
  \ I caught up with Ross Byers, Paizo's assistant software developer. Though he rarely\
  \ disconnects his neural link to the server, he agreed to share what he could about\
  \ the inner workings of Paizo's cyber-bwanas.</p> \n    <p>\"It's a blast! I love\
  \ working here.\" Ross had just finished carving out a virtual farmstead for the\
  \ <a href=\"/paizocon\">PaizoCon '10</a> protocol, and allowed me to interview him\
  \ while he relaxed with a few protein pills. Originally hailing from the primordial\
  \ swamps of central Florida, Ross is no stranger to life-or-death struggles against\
  \ an oppressive environment. Now instead of wrestling 'gators, he turns his life\
  \ experience toward Paizo's digital settlement. Like any small settlement in a strange\
  \ world, the Paizo website and forums can be challenging to oversee, but Ross considers\
  \ them among the better places to code a family. \"Sometimes people get a little\
  \ crazy, but generally [they] keep it on an even temper. They're nice to one another.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Software development is no easy job: from plague-bearing mosquitoes\
  \ to deadly jungle predators, Ross risks his health and safety keeping Paizo.com\
  \ prosperous. Though his duty is life threatening, he still finds time for fun.\
  \ The smurf filter, beloved by the messageboard regulars, started as an April Fool's\
  \ Day gag, but is now maintained and lovingly updated by Ross. \"I also get to see\
  \ the blogs 12 hours before they go up.\"</p> \n    <p>Ross first approached Paizo\
  \ during the 2008 RPG Supersar competition, where he landed as one of the top 32\
  \ finalists. Having been a regular face in the frontier saloon that is the <a href=\"\
  http://chat.dmtools.org/\" target=\"nofollow\">Unofficial Paizo chat room</a>, Ross\
  \ and his rugged style impressed the Paizo founders, and he eventually found himself\
  \ shanghaied to the remote digital outpost he tends today.</p> \n    <p>Paizo's\
  \ web presence, even in these turbulent times, is a factor in its success. Or, as\
  \ Ross phrases it: \"We require the [online] store for people to give us money.\
  \ If we didn't have the store, people couldn't give us money. That's very bad for\
  \ a commercial enterprise,\" although even he readily admits that Paizo's success\
  \ hinges entirely on \"high quality products to sell.\" Still, the Paizo website\
  \ combines quality products from dozens of companies, including treasures that even\
  \ the Amazon.com Imperium doesn't stock. With Ross's loving care and everything\
  \ carefully organized by Jeff Alvarez and Vic Wertz (more on them later), this holdout\
  \ frontier town has blossomed into a thriving community under some of the worst\
  \ conditions.</p> \n    <p>Ross serves as the right hand of the unphotographable\
  \ Gary Teter.</p> \n    <p>Crystal Frasier <br>Production Specialist</p> \n   </blockquote>\
