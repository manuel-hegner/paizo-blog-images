  \ <em>Lost Omens Shining Kingdoms</em> gave us a chance to look at the classical\
  \ fantasy found within the Shining Kingdoms region. From courtly intrigue to valiant\
  \ knights to deadly beast, the Shining Kingdoms hold the potential for unlimited\
  \ adventure. Of course, a region like the Shining Kingdoms doesn’t come to life\
  \ without the help of the authors of this book! So, we’ve taken some time to let\
  \ the wonderful authors of this book talk about themselves.</p>\n      <div class=\"\

  \ all, Sen H.H.S. here, and thank&nbsp;you all for your support of <em>Lost Omens:\
  \ Shining Kingdoms</em>! For those of you who don't know me, I'm a Taiwanese TTRPG\
  \ freelancer (she/her) who has written for Paizo numerous times, from all the way\
  \ back in pre-remaster <em>Bestiary 3</em> to more recent works like <em>Tian Xia\
  \ World Guide</em> and <em>Character Guide</em>, and a couple of Adventure Paths.\
  \ For <em>Lost Omen: Shining Kingdoms</em>, I had the privilege&nbsp;of writing\
  \ the section of Taldor. Alas, one does not simply venture into Taldor without wading\
  \ into the history of the entire southern coast of Avistan, so the work was more\
  \ challenging than imagined. I hope you enjoy what we managed to compile of existing\
  \ lore, as well as any new or revised content-- be it items, archetypes, or lore.\
  \ If you want to stay updated on where you can find my writing next (or currently),\
  \ you can follow me on Bluesky at <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/senhhs.bsky.social\"\
  >senhhs.bsky.social</a>, or keep an eye on my website at&nbsp;<a title=\"This external\
  \ link opens in a new window\" href=\"https://senhhs.carrd.co/\" target=\"_blank\"\
  >https://senhhs.carrd.co</a>. I definitely suggest you keep an eye out during the\
  \ Gen Con season bec-- *NDArted*</p>\n      <br>\n      <h3>Laura Lynn Horst (she/her)</h3>\n\
  \      <p>As a lover of high fantasy since watching my dad perform as Mordred in\
  \ <em>Camelot</em> when I was 5 years old, I was thrilled to contribute to the lore\
  \ of the <em>Shining Kingdoms</em>. This is my third publication for Paizo (that\
  \ I can talk about) and I'm absolutely thrilled with the positive feedback the book\
  \ has received. I was especially excited to see that my contribution of Ulon being\
  \ at the heart of a new pantheon (The Tides of Chaos) got turned into a meme! You\
  \ can't keep a mysterious Azlanti god down. I also contributed to the section on\
  \ Beliefs of the Shining Kingdoms as well as the 2E revamps to the Goldpebble (who\
  \ I hope my GM&nbsp;never puts in front of me as I'm absolutely terrified of snakes)\
  \ and Vovorak&nbsp;in the bestiary. Happy reading all! You can find me on instagram\
  \ and bluesky:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/nyxfromstyx77.bsky.social\"\

  \ and this/that)</h3>\n      <p>Hey all! I'm Derry Luttrell. I'm the host of Dice\
  \ Will Roll, the Queerest Pathfinder Podcast on the Planet, and a writer, illustrator\
  \ and founder of Team+, the 3pp PF2 publishing group behind bestsellers like <em>Witches+</em>,\
  \ <em>Archetypes+</em>, and <em>Tian Xia+</em>. <em>Shining Kingdoms</em> was my\
  \ first writing credit, and I could not be more grateful for it! I was behind the\
  \ Shining Kingdoms Today section, the Factions of the Shining Kingdoms, and the\
  \ Beirean Frosthunt monster. Being able to write about the factions in the Shining\
  \ Kingdoms was huge for me; first and foremost, I had crazy fun coming up with the\
  \ dragon-slaying dwarven mech-pilots and salesmen in the Steelwrought Striders,\
  \ and fleshing out groups like the Lion Blades with Sen and Eagle Knights alongside\
  \ Matt was fantastic. I was able to help bring firearms into Andoran, which I'm\
  \ so excited about! But the thing I'm most pleased with is the Wylderhearts; I pitched\
  \ and developed the original idea, which Michelle baked into an incredible archetype\
  \ later on. The Wylderhearts are a love letter to my own culture, taking heavy inspiration\
  \ from the Fianna, the faoladh (an Irish analogue to benevolent werewolves) and\
  \ Cú Chulainn. TTRPG settings often take Irish ideas and tropes without really paying\
  \ attention to their origin, so being able to make something authentically Irish\
  \ was really important to me— and the end result really was special. I hope you\
  \ enjoy playing wylderhearts as much as I enjoyed making them!</p>\n      <h3>Matt\
  \ Morris</h3>\n      <p>I’m Matt Morris, and I’ve been lucky enough to do freelance\
  \ writing for Pathfinder and Starfinder for several years now, working with Paizo\
  \ and a few 3rd-party companies. I'm currently awaiting the launch of my first Kickstarter,\
  \ a TTRPG called&nbsp;<a title=\"This external link opens in a new window\" href=\"\
  https://www.remnantyears.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Remnant Years: Tales of a\
  \ Ruined Land</em></a>. I was lucky enough to traipse through Andoran for this book,\
  \ and it was exciting to see what's brewing now in the Birthplace of Freedom. (Turns\
  \ out: Lots of plot hooks, some Eagle Knights, and a bucketful of internal conflict.)\
  \ Andoran is a great place for adventure when you want to explore what it means\
  \ to be good, how to hold to principles in difficult circumstances, and what happens\
  \ in the generations after revolutionaries become the establishment. I hope you&nbsp;enjoy\
  \ creating stories there! I keep an up-to-date list of my work on my <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/people/MattMorris6uwio\">Paizo profile</a>, and I’m always looking\
  \ for interesting projects, so feel free to&nbsp;<a title=\"This external link opens\
