  \ of yesterday, the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02ex6?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Tian-Xia-World-Guide\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Tian Xia World Guide</em></a> is officially out! This\
  \ is a region of our setting that we know many of you (not to mention us at Paizo\
  \ as well!) have been looking forward to for some time, and it’s great to be able\
  \ to share this look into the continent with you. Tian Xia takes inspiration from\
  \ Asian fantasy and folklore, and we knew that we wouldn’t be able to bring this\
  \ vast range of stories to life without an all-star team of writers and designers,\
  \ many of whom also worked on the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02etu?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Tian-Xia-Character-Guide\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Tian Xia Character Guide</em></a>, which releases in\

  \      <h3>Eren Ahn (they/them primarily)</h3>\n      <p>안녕하세요, 여러분! My name is\
  \ Eren, and I had the incredibly fun opportunity to refresh Daikitsu and Lao Shu\
  \ Po for the <em>Tian Xia World Guide</em> as well as contributing some lore around\
  \ the mystical imugi. As someone who loves exploring the relationship between mortality\
  \ and divinity, it was an absolute dream to have the opportunity to expand on Tian\
  \ Xia's pantheon. I hope you all fall as deeply in love with the Lady of Foxes and\
  \ Old Rat Woman as I did while writing them.</p>\n      <p>You can find me sporadically\
  \ talking about my writing on <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/erenahn.bsky.social\"\
  >Bluesky</a> (by the time you're reading this, I'll have posted more detailed threads\
  \ on my contributions for this book, if you're interested in reading about my process)\
  \ and talking about everything else on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chromathesia\"\
  >Twitter</a>. You will also see me in a couple of months for the <em>Tian Xia Character\
  \ Guide</em>!</p>\n      <br>\n      <h3>Alyx Bui</h3>\n      <p>Hear ye, hear ye!\
  \ Here come the imperial dragons of Tian Xia! I had the pleasure of crafting and\
  \ writing on the Imperial Dragons and the peoples and land of Zi Ha! This was a\
  \ massive collaboration between so many talented writers and artists—Basheer Ghouse\
  \ to place Arindham, a forest dragon within the Valashmai Jungle, with Jay Zhang\
  \ to place Luong Phung, a sea dragon within Xidao, with Jacky Leung to place Shen\
  \ Ra, a sky dragon within Po Li, with Kevin Thien Vu Long Nguyen to place a sovereign\
  \ dragon, Pham Duc Quan within Xa Hoi, and Grady Wang to place an underworld dragon,\
  \ Zhu Long, within Chu Ye.</p>\n      <p>For Zi Ha, it was brilliant to connect\
  \ with Kienna Shaw, as we placed the samsaran peoples and their origins in this\
  \ magical land. We wanted to make sure that we inserted a non-colonial view of this\
  \ world. I wanted joy and wonder to come out of these harsh, wintery lands—from\
  \ bioluminescent fungi and large, carnivorous plant hunting to festivals that honor\
  \ the mountain peaks, dragon cycles, and the long day and night phases. Enjoy the\
  \ epic lore of Shei Long, a Sky Dragon, and the moon deity Tsukiyo! Continue the\

  \     <p>I'm Banana and I wrote a bunch of stuff for Tian Xia, but what I need EVERYONE\
  \ to know about is the Great Flood, based on the creature Xiangliu. It's one of\
  \ my favorite mythical creatures because of how silly it looks in drawings, but\
  \ if you could see it in real life, it would probably be a body horror disaster.\
  \ It has the body of a giant snake or eel with nine human heads attached to it.\
  \ I'd been wanting to write about the Xiangliu for the longest time, so I'm extremely\
  \ grateful that Paizo gave me that opportunity.</p>\n      <br>\n      <h3>Connie\
  \ Chang (they/he/she)</h3>\n      <p>Hey there! I'm Connie Chang, and I wrote Quain,\
  \ a location full of wuxia fantasies, grandmasters, and cultivation! As a queer\
  \ and trans diasporic Chinese person, I'm a huge fan of the wuxia and xianxia genres\
  \ as a way to explore historical fantasy beyond western imaginations—so of course\
  \ I jumped at the chance to help create something with Paizo. I'm especially interested\
  \ in seeing the stories that will bloom from centuries-old, deeply complicated rivalries\
  \ between grandmasters!</p>\n      <p>Social media: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/byconniechang\"\

  \      <p>Hai tai! Wanne Hiromi yaibiin! Hi! I’m Hiromi! For folks unfamiliar with\
  \ me, I’ve worked on over a hundred books and games, usually as a writer or game\
  \ designer. I’m excited to have worked with Paizo, as I’ve wanted to for years.\
  \ I’m even more excited to say that I also got to work on the <em>Tian Xia Character\
  \ Guide</em> and pen the tie-in fiction <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sii3?Tian-Xia-Days-The-Matsuri\"\
  >The Matsuri</a>! Hopefully, I’ll have more opportunities to work with Paizo in\
  \ the future. If I do, you’ll find out about them from my Bluesky account <a href=\"\
  https://bsky.app/profile/hiromicota.bsky.social\">@hiromicota</a>!</p>\n      <p>For\
  \ the <em>Tian Xia World Guide</em>, I worked on Kwanlai. I had fun providing an\
  \ in-world explanation as to why Kwanlai is principally populated by tengu (a Japanese\
  \ creature) but has a Chinese name. The answer, in short, is colonialism. In real\
  \ life, Japan colonized Uchinaa and foisted the exonym “Okinawa” upon my people.\
  \ So, it was natural for me to depict the Lung Wa conquering the nation of Ootoya\
  \ and foisting the exonym “Kwanlai” on the Ootoyans. Another fun tidbit in the writeup\
  \ is takoyaki (battered and fried octopus) becoming a popular snack due to Wanshou\
  \ (a nation ruled by a kraken) attacking Kwanlai.</p>\n      <br>\n      <h3>Dana\
  \ Ebert (she/her)</h3>\n      <p>Dana Ebert (nonchalant female human writer) is\
  \ a common author to find credited in Pathfinder publications, and the <em>Tian\
  \ Xia World Guide</em> is no exception. Known for fanciful and often extravagant\
  \ prose, her work reimagining Minata is most evident in phrases like \"swallowing\
  \ dragons like krill\" and \"churned the sea like a mortar and pestle.\" In addition\
  \ to authoring the chapter on Minata, she contributed substantial Minata-adjacent\
  \ content to the <em>Tian Xia Character Guide</em>. When she's not writing for Pathfinder,\
  \ Dana is a full-time content creator at <a href=\"https://www.tpkbrewing.com \"\

  \ since I worked freelance for Paizo. Tian Xia was an amazing experience to revisit\
  \ as a player and a creator. I had the pleasure of writing for Po Li and expanding\
  \ life in a country ruled by the theologic elite and how people governed by oracles\
  \ thrive despite its previously sheltered portrayal in earlier works. I had the\
  \ opportunity to provide faces to the extremely secretive Oracular Council that\
  \ governs Po Li, introduce the equally secretive Lapis Watchers, and expand new\
  \ iconic locations for players to explore such as Tuotuo, the Enlightened City—\
  a historical education center containing special archives housing racks of prophecies\
  \ and oracular writings. Beyond the nostalgic glamor lies also the Emperor's Footprint,\
  \ a site rumored to contain mystical properties, a supposed asteroid, and stunning\
  \ panoramic beauty—just highly dangerous and full of monsters, I'm sure it's fine.\
  \ I hope folx gets to experience the social and political dissonance that awaits\
  \ them when adventuring through Po Li; it was a fantastic challenge.</p>\n     \

  \ world. For many of you it will be a marvelous opportunity to immerse yourself\
  \ in a land rich with cultures perhaps outside your own. I'm right there with you.\
  \ This was my first contribution to Pathfinder's rich world, and I never expected\
  \ to go so deep into exploring my own culture and heritage through the lens of Wanshou's\
  \ horror and paranoia. Just remember, if anything bad happens to your party while\

  \ party member's fault. You know which one I'm talking about.</p>\n      <p>I work\

  \      <br>\n      <h3>Tan Shao Han</h3>\n      <p>Hi! I'm Tan Shao Han / 陈绍涵 (family\
  \ name Tan/Chen, 陈; generational name, Shao 绍; personal name, Han 涵), a TTRPG creator,\
  \ lecturer, and cultural consultant from Singapore, Southeast Asia. I'm proudly\
  \ part of the RPGSEA TTRPG design movement based in Southeast Asia! I grew up a\
  \ steady diet on wuxia media (movies, books, TV series, manhua), and am happy to\
  \ re-imagine and create settings (the histories, lands, and peoples of Goka and\
  \ Songbai) in the <em>Tian Xia World Guide</em> to inspire the telling of new wuxia-influenced\
  \ stories in your Pathfinder games! It has been an absolute privilege to work on\
  \ the Tian Xia books, alongside great colleagues and supervisors whom I now have\
  \ the pleasure to call my friends.</p>\n      <p>Outside of freelancing with Paizo,\
  \ I also run an indie TTRPG company, <a href=\"https://www.curiouschimeras.com/\"\
  >Curious Chimeras</a>. If you're interested in more of my takes on Chinese fantasy,\
  \ check out my recent indie games: <a href=\"https://www.curiouschimeras.com/product/swordfarer/\"\
  ><em>Swordfarer</em></a>, a wuxia journaling game of jianghu melancholia and friendships\
  \ and <a href=\"https://www.curiouschimeras.com/product/shrine-the-siege-of-yueyuan/\"\
  ><em>Shrine</em></a>, a xianxia storytelling game of karma, despair, and reincarnation.\

  \ y’all! Ruvaid here. You may have seen my name in previous Paizo books such as\
  \ <em>Dark Archive</em>, <em>Impossible Lands</em>, and <em>Rage of Elements</em>.\
  \ For the <em>Tian Xia World Guide</em>, I wrote the entry for the nation of Hongal.\
  \ I have a deep appreciation for Mongolian culture from which Hongal draws inspiration,\
  \ and I endeavored to bring as much respect to my words as possible. I sincerely\
  \ hope that you enjoy reading about Hongal as much as I enjoyed writing about it.</p>\n\
  \      <p>If you’re looking for a South Asian/Muslim freelancer for your next project,\
  \ or should you simply wish to perceive me, you can find me on Twitter <a href=\"\

  https://bsky.app/profile/darthruvaider.bsky.social\">@darthruvaider.bsky.social</a>.\
  \ Until next time, and happy Pathfinding!</p>\n      <br>\n      <h3>Grady Wang\
  \ (he/him)</h3>\n      <p>Howdy, I'm Grady and my work on Chu Ye in the <em>World\
  \ Guide</em> was my first-ever assignment for Paizo! I'm so excited that it's finally\
  \ out! This nation has incredible potential for grand stories, from its historical\
  \ contributions to medicinal knowledge to the present-day four-way clash between\
  \ its greedy oni ruling class, a scrappy humanoid rebellion, an underworld dragon\
  \ out for revenge, and a jealous god. I was also thrilled to be able to draw upon\
  \ my Chinese and Taiwanese heritages to expand Chu Ye’s culture and its experiences\
  \ under occupation.</p>\n      <p>My next contribution will be in the <em>Character\
  \ Guide</em> coming later this year, which contains Tian Xia’s unique takes on medicine.\
  \ You can also find me online at The Gallant Goblin where my partner and I review\
  \ TTRPG products on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/thegallantgoblin\">https://www.youtube.com/thegallantgoblin</a>,\
  \ sell kobold plushies at <a href=\"https://www.gallantgoblin.com/heroplush/\">heroplush.com</a>,\
  \ and produce expanded content for Pathfinder at <a href=\"https://www.pathfinderinfinite.com/\"\
  >https://www.pathfinderinfinite.com/</a>, where we just released the first community\
  \ print-on-demand product, <em>Adventures in Jalmeray</em>, which is an anthology\
