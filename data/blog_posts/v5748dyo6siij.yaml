  \    </div>\n     <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Sichen was three\
  \ when the grandmasters first clashed in Zhining Village. She remembered it clearly.\
  \ The magistrate’s villa was torn from the earth like an obstinate weed, which made\
  \ everyone cheer, then it was thrown into the drinkhouse, which made everyone groan.\
  \ But the grandmasters didn’t care. On her father’s back, her small body bouncing\
  \ to the cadence of his footsteps as they fled their family’s inn, Sichen watched\
  \ the fighters with unafraid curiosity. Even as ceramic shattered and geese honked\
  \ and people shouted, even as a broken oxcart flew into the air with a braying ox\
  \ in tow, even as magic tightened like a fist about to strike, the grandmasters\
  \ had eyes only for each other.</p>\n      <p>Sichen was fourteen when the grandmasters\
  \ clashed again. One moment, she was blearily feeding the chickens, catching what\
  \ she could of the morning light streaking through the yews, and then the earth\
  \ was shaking and Old Man Ping’s house was gone. He was still there, yawning in\
  \ bed, before he realized he had no walls. (To this day, the people of Zhining were\
  \ still finding bits of Old Man Ping’s roof scattered across town, like fragments\
  \ of broken teeth.) He made a noise Sichen thought only harpies could make, said\
  \ a word she wasn’t allowed to say, then took off toward the nearest building for\
  \ shelter, which unfortunately was the inn. As her fathers came out with blankets\
  \ and mortified expressions, Sichen stared at the rubble, pulverized in a blast\
  \ of concentrated qi that arced from across town, which could only mean one thing:\
  \ the grandmasters were back.</p>\n      <p>Sichen eagerly stepped into the street\
  \ to get a better look, but then her dad’s hand was on her shoulder and her father\
  \ was calling her from inside. It wasn’t safe, she was a child, she had chores.\
  \ “Little Chen,” her dad scolded, guiding her away from the street. “Those grandmasters\
  \ despise each other. You don’t want to be caught in their fury, do you?”</p>\n\
  \      <p>With a final, forlorn look in the direction of the grandmasters who despised\
  \ each other, Sichen trudged indoors.</p>\n      <p>Sichen was twenty-two when the\
  \ grandmasters clashed again. Old Man Ping’s granddaughter Leyue had come back to\
  \ Zhining to take care of him and was helping out at Sichen’s inn to earn extra\
  \ coin. Even outside of work, Sichen found herself spending time with Leyue: wasting\
  \ coppers at the drinkhouse, laughing about nothing, teaching each other martial\
  \ forms they’d picked up here and there. Neither were cultivators, but that idle\
  \ Quain hope was strong in their hearts: “maybe one day.” They were sitting by the\
  \ docks, the glistening waters of the Dragon Sweat Run as bright and promising as\
  \ gold. Their hands touched; Sichen’s pulse quickened. She leaned in, but the river\
  \ surged.</p>\n      <p>Roaring like a dragon made of shimmering taels, the water\
  \ smashed onto the bank three hundred bu away. Sichen grabbed Leyue’s wrist and\
  \ pulled her from the crumbling jetty. Waves undulated, subsuming fishing boats\
  \ and spitting angry brine at the shouting, fleeing harborside merchants. A cultivator\
  \ stood on the bank, a single arm outstretched, the pummeling deluge of river water\
  \ parted in dark slices at her feet. She was a lithe, handsome woman with short\
  \ black hair and a temperate face that made Sichen think of a temple statue. Sichen\
  \ recognized her immediately: she was one of the two grandmasters from eight years\
  \ ago; from nineteen years ago. Her face and body were virtually unchanged. A dim\
  \ memory rose—her father, pulling her aside, having found the cultivation books\
  \ Sichen had spent a whole month’s tips on. Cultivators are to commoners as the\
  \ Dragon Sweat Run is to a single drop of water... and grandmasters are to cultivators\
  \ what the ocean is to the Run.</p>\n      <p>A second cultivator flitted above\
  \ the rushing, swirling water. Colorful robes billowed around her body. She was\
  \ a fat woman, cloaked in power and magic, her face a pure halo of beauty that left\
  \ Sichen breathless. Even after she and Leyue ran to safety, Sichen couldn’t shake\
  \ the image of those two grandmasters glowering at each other, focused and limitless,\
  \ as though each of them were the only thing the other could see.</p>\n      <p>Over\
  \ the course of Sichen’s life, the grandmasters clashed a few more times in Zhining,\
  \ making all other duels in the village seem trite in comparison. Although their\
  \ property damage was considerable, the grandmasters’ blows never fell on bystanders.\
  \ Stories of the decades-long rivalry spread throughout the province, drawing tourists\
  \ and traders to such an extent that the magistrate’s son (by now the magistrate\
  \ himself), commissioned the local stoneworker to erect two statues in their honor\
  \ by the town gates with a simple plinth: “may their mutual hatred feed our village\
  \ for years to come.” Some villagers even looked forward to the grandmasters’ clashes,\
  \ taking bets on when they would next hurtle into town like an unexpected typhoon.\
  \ Sichen always bet, and she always won.</p>\n      <p>Sichen was eighty-five when\
  \ the grandmasters clashed for the last time in Zhining Village. She was managing\
  \ the front desk of the inn when Leyue came out from the office. Her wife kissed\
  \ her on the cheek and handed her a coin. “Extra from the ledgers,” she said with\
  \ a smile. Sichen kissed her back and placed the coin on the ancestral shrine, which\
  \ bore a small painting of her fathers and Old Man Ping. As she turned back to the\
  \ customer, a cabbage smashed through the front doors before being drawn back by\
  \ an implosion of air, shattering the windows on its way out.</p>\n      <div class=\"\

  \      </div>\n      <br>\n      <p>The customers shouted and ducked for cover.\
  \ Sichen exchanged a look with Leyue, her eyes bright and shining and eager. “Wait\
  \ here,” she said, then grabbed her cane and ran outside.</p>\n      <p>The grandmasters\
  \ were in the inn’s square—her square—and they were fighting with the same single-minded\
  \ fervor they had for the past eighty-five years. One held a cabbage cart over her\
  \ head with one arm. The other turned, tore a stone lion from the inn’s doorstep,\
  \ and held it like a bat. As the other villagers shouted and ran, Sichen stayed\
  \ at the threshold, watching intensely. The cart flew, the lion swiped through the\
  \ air, wood exploded, and vegetables burst everywhere. One of the grandmasters grinned\
  \ cockily as she ripped up another statue; the other raised a second cart over her\
  \ head—</p>\n      <p>“Oh, that’s ENOUGH!” Sichen found herself yelling. “Just admit\
  \ you like each other, already!”</p>\n      <p>The grandmasters startled. For the\
  \ first time since Sichen had known them, they looked away from each other—and at\
  \ her. The inexplicable courage that had filled her froze, like a stag caught in\
  \ a hunter’s sights. The immensity of not one, but two grandmasters fixing her with\
  \ their undivided attention was almost too much for her old, mortal body to handle;\
  \ her heart palpitated, her nerves sang—</p>\n      <p>The handsome woman laughed.\
  \ The woman in the colorful robes looked at her with a stunned expression, then\
  \ she began laughing as well. The sound made Sichen think of Dragon Sweat Run at\
  \ twilight, the water rushing over the rocks, Leyue’s head in her lap. Then the\
  \ grandmasters stopped laughing; they took each other’s hands with an intimacy that\
  \ made Sichen’s cheeks burn, and then they walked. They walked out of the square,\
  \ they walked through the streets, they walked past the gates, and they were never\
  \ seen in Zhining Village again.</p>\n      <p>Leyue came out of the inn, clucking\
  \ at the damage. “Aiya! Couldn't they have left a tael or two as an apology?”</p>\n\
  \      <p>But Sichen just smiled. “Grandmasters are to regular people as the ocean\
  \ is to a single drop of water,” she said. “They’re more powerful than anyone can\
  \ imagine, but they forget the simplest things, like saying ‘I’m sorry’ or ‘Thank\
  \ you.’” She turned to Leyue with a glimmering look that made her wife’s heart rise\
  \ to the surface of her chest. “Or ‘I love you.’”</p>\n      <p>And with that, Sichen\
  \ kissed Leyue, and they went back inside.</p>\n     </blockquote>\n     <p style=\"\
