  https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgxd?Adventure-Time-Edge-of-Anarchy\"\
  >the first installment</a> of our behind-the-scenes look at the Pathfinder Adventure\
  \ Card Game’s <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01ws8?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Curse-of-the-Crimson-Throne-Adventure-Path\"\
  >Curse of the Crimson Throne Adventure Path</a>, we covered Adventure 1: Edge of\
  \ Anarchy. By the end of that chapter, you learned that Korvosa is a strange city\
  \ full of criminals (both big- and small-time) and devils (mostly small… for now),\
  \ and that many of those are respected citizens. Now it’s time for things to get\
  \ grim: a plague descends on the city. Let’s walk through Adventure 2: Seven Days\
  \ to the Grave. Bring out your dead!</p> \n     <p>Throughout this adventure, I\
  \ encourage you to use the Harrows wildcard Harrow of Shields for additional flavor\
  \ and challenge. If you’re on the fence about this extra challenge, consider using\
  \ the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgxd?Adventure-Time-Edge-of-Anarchy\"\
  >Base suggestion from the previous Adventure Time blog</a>, or only apply Harrow\
  \ of Shields when you have at least 3 cards in your discards (ensuring that <i>heal</i>\
  \ effects will always provide some value).</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ skill.</p> \n     </div> \n     <p>Let’s talk a little bit about the scourge Plagued.\
  \ Nobody wants to be plagued. And as soon as someone is, nobody wants to hang out\
  \ with them. Or suddenly everyone is plagued. It won’t kill your character quickly,\
  \ but you’ll want to remove the scourge as soon as possible. The best ways to do\
  \ so are to play your harrow, which lets you remove a scourge this adventure, or\
  \ to go to the Base. Otherwise, you might want to stock up on boons like Antiplague,\
  \ Balmberry, Remove Disease, Plague Mask, or Soothing Word.</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  >Just a vat of diseased liquid with a disease daemon pickling in it. Like you do.</p>\
  \ \n     </div> \n     <p>Every scenario in Seven Days to the Grave has its splash\
  \ of plague to toss around. As long as you’re careful around wererats and plague\
  \ zombies, though, you’ll mostly be okay. (The final scenario has a bit more than\
  \ a splash, though. More like a deluge, or a particularly unhealthy bath. More about\
  \ that later, though.)</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/110119_PlagueShip.jpg\"\

  \ alt=\"Image of a ship with tattered sails at night at port for the Pathfinder\

  \ kind of ship that brings <i>good</i> things to town.</p> \n     </div> \n    \
  \ <p>Before playing scenario 2A: Rats and the Sinking Ship, <a href=\"https://paizo.com/paizo/faq/v5748nrupch3h#v5748eaidgsil\"\
  >please observe its FAQ.</a></p> \n     <p>When disease suddenly breaks out in Korvosa,\
  \ there’s a rush to find out how. And there’s an even more intense rush to blame\
  \ just about anyone and take advantage of the chaos for personal benefit. (Sometimes\
  \ Korvosa is a little too realistic.) In scenario 2A, the finger-pointing has settled\
  \ on a gang of wererats. After spending some time exploring the back alleys and\
  \ sewers of Old Town, you determine they have nothing to do with it, but their dictator\
  \ Girrigz does have plans to take advantage of the chaos. Once you deal with him,\
  \ the wererats are happy to be helpful members of society and point you toward a\
  \ sunken ship that might’ve brought the disease to town. It’s guarded by a sea hag\
  \ druid and her (lone) shark, but not for long!</p> \n     <p>To increase the difficulty\
  \ of this scenario, I’d suggest the Perils wildcards Desperate and Impoverished\
  \ to evoke the sudden exhaustion of supplies and closing up of the town. The Onslaughts\
  \ wildcard Wearisome is also solid, given how much swimming and sewer spelunking\
  \ the characters need to do.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/110119_ZombieParty.jpg\"\

  \ \n      <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Nobody told me it was a Bring Your Own Zombie\
  \ party!</p> \n     </div> \n     <p>In scenario 2B: The Life of the Party, you\
  \ continue your search for clues started in the previous scenario, stumbling into\
  \ the “undead everywhere” part of the adventure. In addition to some opportunistic\
  \ vampire spawn, the highlight of the scenario is a nod to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Masque_of_the_Red_Death\"\
  >“The Masque of the Red Death.”</a> Worried about plague, some nobles have cheerfully\
  \ shut themselves up in a manor house with a bunch of supplies, intending to have\
  \ a long party while waiting out the trouble. That lasts right up until Jolistina\
  \ Susperio, apprentice to the town’s favorite necromancer-slash-serial-killer Rolth\
  \ Lamm (you raided his lair for body parts back in scenario 1C: The Dead Warrens),\
  \ crashes the party... and turns everyone into zombies. Then she restarts the party,\
  \ complete with costumed zombie dancing! Sanity is not one of Jolistina’s strengths.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The Onslaughts wildcard Monstrous works well with the scenario’s closing\
  \ rules as well as the selection of level 2 monsters in Curse. For Legendary mode,\
  \ I’d suggest the Perils wildcard Deadly to amplify those Plague Zombies, or the\
  \ Perils wildcard Unhallowed to suit the rampant necromancy. <i>[Editor note: “\
  Suit.” I see what you did there.]</i></p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a\

  \ \n      <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\">This looks not at all suspicious.</p> \n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>In the RPG, right up until this point, it can be pretty unclear\
  \ if the Queen is doing anything wrong. In fact, in one of my groups, one player\
  \ loved the Queen so much she wanted to become a Gray Maiden. Thankfully, the party\
  \ found out that’d be a bad idea before she got too far. The cover of the hardcover\
  \ edition does make it a little more likely for the players to suspect her from\
  \ the start, though.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/110119_PlagueDoctor.jpg\"\

  font-size: 13px;\">These Queen’s Physicians also seem not at all suspicious.</p>\
  \ \n     </div> \n     <p>Still, in scenario 2C: The Queen’s Hospitality, you have\
  \ plenty of reason to want to sneak and talk your way past as many of the Gray Maidens\
  \ and Queen’s Physicians as you can. (Along those lines, my wife’s character had\
  \ a long-lost sister she’d been trying to track down that I’d made into a Gray Maiden,\
  \ figuring it would lead to a great reveal. I underestimated the ability of players\
  \ to foil any plan, though: Through a combination of well-planned and lucky acrobatics,\
  \ stealth, and timing, she managed to miss interacting with her sister by literal\
  \ inches. Oops.)</p> \n     <p>If you have the right skills, this scenario isn’\
  t all that difficult, so when adding wildcards, you may want to consider how much\
  \ Diplomacy, Perception, and/or Stealth the group has. If you have those skills,\
  \ I’d encourage the Perils wildcard Hostile to provide a little more danger and\
  \ suspense. The Perils wildcard Confusing and Onslaughts wildcard Hazardous also\
  \ feel appropriate for wading through the deception and betrayal. If your group\
  \ is rarely pressed for time, I’d add an additional location (adding Storehouse\
  \ to the list for 6 characters).</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\

  \ false trails laid by the Queen’s minions, in scenario 2D: The Cult of Urgathoa,\
  \ you discover a fully-fledged temple to the goddess of the undead under the city.\
  \ There you also discover a vampire scholar who helped craft the blood veil plague\
  \ and is studying why some portion of the populace seems to be immune to it. And\
  \ those previously mentioned vats where cultists are currently brewing a thousand\
  \ gallons of “viscous, phlegm-like fluid of concentrated blood veil.” After you\
  \ deal with the villain in charge of the temple (twice!), you’ll save the city from\
  \ the plague!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/110119_DaughterOfUrgathoa.jpg\"\

  \ 13px;\">All pretense of civility is out once an Aspect of Urgathoa shows up.</p>\
  \ \n     </div> \n     <p>If your group is good at cornering villains, adding the\
  \ location Blood Pool is a solid option. The Perils wildcards Hostile and Unhallowed\
  \ and the Onslaughts wildcard Withering are all good fits thematically and mechanically.\
  \ Because of the risk of plague and this scenario’s villain powers, managing your\
  \ discards and buried cards adds suspense and a fear of death that will make winning\
  \ this chapter feel like a well-earned triumph.</p> \n     <p>That’s Seven Days\
  \ to the Grave. I promise you won’t need to make nearly as many Constitution Fortitude\
  \ checks ever again. Probably. <i>[Editor note: No promises!]</i></p> \n    </blockquote>\
