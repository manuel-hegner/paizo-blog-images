  \ the anniversary of our total party kill at the bottom of the Abomination Vaults,\
  \ it’s time to make public what we sometimes call “Session Plus One.” While we’\
  d love to sit around and chat after the final die roll is made, the end of a marathon\
  \ is usually a frenzy: players are leaving for long rides or flights home, there\
  \ is the cleanup after days of Pathfinder, a scramble to capture any material we\
  \ can, and then finally much-needed sleep. The Abomination Arsenal ended with a\
  \ 22-hour session, which compounded everything just mentioned. Typically, after\
  \ things settle down, we get together (remotely if necessary) and chat about everything\
  \ from our favorite moments of the project to the rooms we wish we had explored.\
  \ Everyone brings questions for our GM about all the things we missed along the\
  \ way, feedback about the project, and especially the “what if” scenarios that we\
  \ just have to know the answer to. Suffice it to say, Adam is all about <a href=\"\
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fZlcMQ7LHM\">reflection</a>, and weighs it evenly\
  \ with the prep sessions before a launch.</p>\n      <br>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  >Part 7</a></li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>We’ll start with a glance at the hours,\
  \ as this campaign clocked in close to some of the six-part Adventure Paths we’\
  ve played. The foremost reason for this is that we roleplayed a ton; there is plenty\
  \ of story to be found in Abomination Vaults, and we brought a party with a lot\
  \ of depth. Privately, we set out to prove that just because we all had the same\
  \ class, that didn’t mean our roleplaying would suffer. Second, we often featured\
  \ many members of the Black Powder Cadre at each marathon, which meant more players\
  \ at the table and slower combats. Lastly, we backtracked a bunch, including revisiting\
  \ old levels to double-check certain areas or comb them again for anything we may\
  \ have missed. We never did get the teleporters working, and we remember spending\
  \ the better part of an afternoon being chased through the megadungeon by a flesh\
  \ golem that always seemed to know where we were.</p>\n      <ul>\n       <li><strong>Completed\
  \ Adventure Path</strong>: Abomination Vaults</li>\n       <li><strong>Total Marathon\
  \ Hours</strong>: 431 hours, 15min</li>\n       <li><strong>Total Session Hours</strong>:\

  ></p>\n      </div>\n      <br>\n      <h2>Misses</h2>\n      <p>□ The luckiest\
  \ shot of the campaign was the one that never landed. If you’ve read community feedback\
  \ about Abomination Vaults, you’ve probably heard of the voidglutton on level four.\
  \ While James Jacobs was kind enough to let it kill a single character so the rest\
  \ could flee, for groups that <em>should</em> flee immediately but stick around,\
  \ it’s bait for a TPK. Zoric went first and rolled a 29 to hit. If he had hit, we\
  \ wouldn’t have known its armor class was insanely high, so we would have stayed\
  \ – we all agree the project would have ended. The same can be said if Zoric rolled\
  \ too low and missed. Our character builds weren’t developed enough and we were\
  \ really struggling at those levels, so we ran on round one and never went back.</p>\n\
  \      <p>□ One of the factors that lead to our failure in the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Majj1LxZzXc\"\
  >final encounter</a> was a general lack of understanding regarding Belcorra, Nhimbaloth,\
  \ and possible ways to defeat the ghost queen. On level three, we missed finding\
  \ a secret door in the library that contained an important book: <em>The Whispering\
  \ Reeds. </em>There is no way to overstate how key it was that we failed to obtain\
  \ this, as it contained highly useful information about Nhimbaloth that might have\
  \ changed our actions in the final encounter. Worse yet, you saw we missed several\
  \ rooms the voidglutton was guarding, which contained more lore about Belcorra and\
  \ the <em>Whispering Reeds</em>. Here is the best part: To make sure we didn’t miss\
  \ anything, we returned to the library as higher-level characters and searched once\
  \ more – but our Perception rolls were terrible.</p>\n      <p>□ So there we were\
  \ on level nine, and we still had only a vague idea of what we needed to do to kill\
  \ Belcorra permanently. Another bit of hope was lost when we ran into one of the\
  \ encounters that can shut down and downright abuse a party of gunslingers. A clay\
  \ golem AND a graveknight emerged from a secret vault together – in close quarters\
  \ – with little room for our retreat. We were lucky to have survived, and never\
  \ found the <em>fulcrum lattice </em>that would have helped us better understand\
  \ what to do with the lenses we kept acquiring.&nbsp;</p>\n      <br>\n      <h2>Behind\
  \ the Scenes:</h2>\n      <p>□ What we didn’t say at the outset, was that there\
  \ had never been a single gunslinger (or equivalent class) in any of our campaigns\
  \ – not one. We also have no plans, nor any desire to include a gunslinger in our\
  \ future projects. We absolutely loved this journey and want it to remain a cherished\
  \ memory. Instead, let this project be appreciated as a testament to the diversity\
  \ of experiences that can be found within Pathfinder.&nbsp;</p>\n      <p>□ There\
  \ are props that don’t always show up in pictures but are with us throughout. Our\
  \ favorite was the ammo crate mentioned briefly in the introduction blog. This crate\
  \ with “OAD” emblazoned on it was at every marathon, whether it was in the studio,\
  \ on the patio, or around us where we slept. We put dice, books, even Gatorade in\
  \ it, and you can see it with the Amber Die alongside a set of our own <a href=\"\
  https://www.norsefoundry.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoq5JVcalDU1hu4uFC-1iKS6kNg8S_qF64XI7qXRvbWfFpAYsnq6\"\
  >Norse Foundry</a> dice.</p>\n      <p>□ With the sheer number of session hours\
  \ we clocked, we added more new members in this project than any that has come before,\
  \ bringing the total to thirty-two since 1987. Congrats to Auralee, Theodora, Doug,\
  \ and Karee! That makes two more nurses, another teacher, and the owner of <a href=\"\
  https://criticalhitcookies.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoqJmJRXEwPKZR-RBC_oOHI-bAkeDSoRv_6wfzHeYvOQfb22Hhz1\"\
  >Critical Hit Cookies</a>!</p>\n      <p>□ Our projects have a lot more that we\
  \ can’t always slow down to feature. One of these was every gunslinger’s friend:\
  \ custom-painted magnetic trackers for whether your gun was loaded, jammed, or empty.\
  \ Another was the set of bullet dice our GM handed us after the first marathon—\
  one die for each player. The last was Doug’s painting of our favorite scene, which\
  \ will forever hang on the walls of Fort Rannick (our headquarters) for future members\
  \ to behold!</p>\n      <p>□ Want to play Abomination Vaults with us? We’ve been\
  \ known to run the Vaults at <a href=\"https://tabletop.events/conventions/philadelphia-area-gaming-expo-page-3\"\

  \ “Alright guys, it’s 5am, just keep that in mind.”<br>\n        Julian: “It’s 5am?\
  \ We need to beat Belcorra quick, cause I gotta be in homeroom in two hours!”</p>\n\
  \      <br>\n      <h2>Aftermath</h2>\n      <p>The town of Otari wasn’t the same\
  \ after the Black Powder Cadre failed to emerge from the Vaults that last time.\
  \ The citizens had already begun to speak of us as the Roseguard reformed, and had\
  \ no idea they would never see us again. By now, a statue to our first fallen companion—\
  Rome—stood in the center of town. Ayla’s Oddities and Collectibles, a general store\
  \ started by our companion Maloika, had become the go-to place for just about all\
  \ your needs. Carman Rajani, the dejected blacksmith, used his acquaintance with\
  \ us to win the election for mayor, and had promised to rename the town “Rome.”\
  \ It was a slick move, as the town had been named Otari for the fallen companion\
  \ of the Roseguard hundreds of years before.</p>\n      <p>When you arrive, you’\
  ll find Otari a dark place, with an empty general store and a careless mayor. Yet,\
  \ the damage we did to the Abomination Vaults will take Belcorra years to repair\
  \ as she replaces her forces.</p>\n      <p>Which is just enough time for your group\
  \ to finish her off.</p>\n      <br>\n      <h2>Follow Order of the Amber Die:</h2>\n\
