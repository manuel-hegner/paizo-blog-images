  \ of the tavern and into the treasure with <a href=\"/products/btpy8wfn/\"><i>Pathfinder\
  \ Player Companion: Dungeoneer's Handbook</i></a>! Since this book is just over\
  \ the horizon, I thought I'd treat you all with a sneak preview of what I think\
  \ are just a couple of the coolest parts about this dungeon-delving must-have.</span></p>\
  \ \n     <ol class=\"list\">\n      <li><b>Dungeon Guides!</b> Found yourself more\
  \ lost than a bat in an area of silence? Never fear with dungeon guides! Each of\
  \ these tomes is keyed to a specific adventure location and can help dungeon delvers\
  \ figure out what kinds of dangers might lurk around the next corner. Bibliophilic\
  \ dungeoneers should be wary however, for the veracity of these volumes is variable,\
  \ and those who rely too frequently on their supposedly trusty tour book might discover\
  \ only too late the flights of fancy implicit in these over-the-top tomes!</li>\
  \ \n      <li><b>New Alchemical Items!</b> With such items as glowing gel-tubes,\
  \ pebbles that expand into boulders with water, and smoke pellets that cover invisible\
  \ creatures with sticky black resin, the aspiring trickster need look no further\
  \ than the cornucopia of alchemical items unveiled in this volume. Oh, and did we\
  \ mention new alchemist discoveries for those bomb-slinging partisans of all things\
  \ potable?</li> \n      <li><b>Essential Tips and Tricks!</b> Discover solutions\
  \ to common dungeoneering quandaries with sections on monsters, traps, and treasure.\
  \ Whether your task involves outsmarting the minotaur guard, throwing an unwitting\
  \ foe into a suspected swinging blade trap, or figuring out how to haul all that\
  \ booty back to town, <i>Dungeoneer's Handbook</i> will have you covered with clever\
  \ advice, helpful suggestions, and brand new feats!</li> \n      <li><b>New Hirelings!</b>\
  \ Who's taking care of your horses outside while you're excavating that kobold-infested\
  \ mineshaft, anyway? Wonder no more with handy new hirelings—NPCs that specialize\
  \ in making your dungeoneering career a lucrative one while you concentrate on the\
  \ action.</li> \n      <li><b>Archetypes, Spells, and More!</b> With new magic items,\
  \ spells, archetypes, feats, traits, equipment, and more, this book will leave every\
  \ crypt delver and tomb raider fully prepared for their next dungeon visit!</li>\n\
