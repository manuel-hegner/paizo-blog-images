  \ <p class=\"date\">Friday, October 16, 2009</p> \n    <p>So, I've made no secret\
  \ of the fact that I've given large parts of my 25+ year-old homebrew campaign setting,\
  \ Baria, over to Golarion. One of the more successful of these imports are the Red\
  \ Mantis assassins—and by extension, their home city of Ilizmagorti. When it came\
  \ time to assign authors for <a href=\"/pathfinderChronicles/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy87d5\"\
  ><i>Cities of Golarion</i></a>, I was sorely tempted to claim the chapter on Ilizmagorti\
  \ as my own—I was nervous that even if another author did a GREAT job with the city\
  \ that the end result wouldn't match my own personal vision of the city. The same\
  \ goes for the city's map, to be honest. But my work schedule being what it was\
  \ (I'd already taken up two chapters of <a href=\"/pathfinderChronicles/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy87d7\"\
  ><i>Classic Horrors Revisited</i></a>, alas, I couldn't responsibly claim the chapter\
  \ of Ilizmagorti for <i>Cities of Golarion</i> as my own. And so, with some nervous\
  \ fear and much wringing of hands, I gave it up for someone else to write about.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>I'm happy to say that what Rob McCreary wrought with his words is exactly\
  \ what I'd envisioned for the city of Ilizmagorti—he hit every nail square, and\
  \ the resulting chapter is hands-down my favorite in the book as a result (which\
  \ is saying something, since there was some tough competition!). Even more exciting,\
  \ he came up with some concepts that I'd never thought of for Baria's Ilizmagorti—\
  concepts that inspired me in some really fun ways. It's really weird being inspired\
  \ to write things about something you made up due to someone else's work on that\
  \ concept! Weird, but wonderful!</p> \n    <p>Yet as wonderful as Rob's words were,\
  \ a city can live or die by its map. For <i>Cities of Golarion</i>, we tackled the\
  \ creation somewhat differently. We hired writers to write the chapters, but we\
  \ hired artists and cartographers to create the city maps. Long-time readers of\
  \ this blog might remember earlier this year when I posted the Map Open Call—the\
  \ results are some of the best city maps that Paizo's had the pleasure to print.\
  \ Presented here are the two versions of the map of Ilizmagorti—the first one created\
  \ by Daniel Thomson, based on my outline of what the city should incorporate. The\
  \ other map is the final version you'll see in the book and in the <a href=\"/pathfinderChronicles/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy87d6\"\
  ><i>Cities Map Folio</i></a> as a four-panel poster. (We've left the tags off of\
  \ Rob's map so you can ogle the beauty of his work easier.)</p> \n    <div align=\"\
