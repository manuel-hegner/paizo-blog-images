  description\">As the August 15 release date, and the July 5–7 demos at PaizoCon\
  \ approach, I've been given the opportunity to pull back the curtains and talk about\
  \ the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game a bit. As a developer for the game, I've spent\
  \ much time and effort translating the Rise of the Runelords storyline and elements\
  \ of the Pathfinder rules and campaign setting into a new medium. One of our biggest\
  \ challenges was keeping the flavor of the world and of the RPG intact while keeping\
  \ the card game fun, exciting, and respectful of the established traditions of Pathfinder.</span></p>\
  \ \n    <p>Though much of my focus involved adapting the Rise of the Runelords storyline,\
  \ the PACG Base Set also offers three introductory scenarios that take place around\
  \ the town of Sandpoint before the actual Adventure Path kicks off. One of these,\
  \ Black Fang's Dungeon, was inspired by the introductory adventure in the Pathfinder\
  \ RPG Beginner Box, and in this blog, I'll use that scenario to illustrate how we\
  \ developed elements of the PACG to evoke the flavor of the Pathfinder RPG and the\
  \ Pathfinder campaign setting while meeting the needs of a new kind of Pathfinder\
  \ game.</p> \n    <p>We'll start with the Black Fang's Dungeon scenario card itself.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/Dungeon1.jpg\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/Dungeon1_120.jpeg\" border=\"\

  /image/content/Blog/Dungeon2_120.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a> \n     <br>Scenario: Black\
  \ Fang's Dungeon\n    </div> \n    <p>The dragon Black Fang lairs in a cave connected\
  \ to a network of ancient ruins inhabited by undead. The card back—that's the image\
  \ on the right—lists a variety of locations that characters will explore during\
  \ the scenario, and offers some flavor text to set the scene. </p> \n    <p>On the\
  \ front of the card—the image on the left—you can see that Black Fang is the villain\
  \ for this scenario, while the \"Henchmen\" list indicates that the players will\
  \ also encounter a number of Ancient Skeletons. The \"During this Scenario\" text\
  \ effectively changes each skeleton that a character encounters into a small cadre\
  \ of undead that attacks everyone at the location. The bottom of the card describes\
  \ the reward that the players will receive after completing the scenario.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Let's take a look at Black Fang's undead allies.</p> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/Skeleton.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img\
  \ src=\"/image/content/Blog/Skeleton_120.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a> \n     <br>Henchman:\
  \ Ancient Skeleton\n    </div> \n    <p>Fights against animated skeletons have been\
  \ a staple of adventure roleplaying since its very earliest days. We designed the\
  \ pieces of the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game to fit together in a multitude of\
  \ ways, for the benefit of the scenarios and adventures we design, and also for\
  \ any you might put together yourself. The Ancient Skeleton henchman is a great\
  \ basic opponent for a low-level scenario.</p> \n    <p>Let's look at the Ancient\
  \ Skeleton's powers. As befits a creature of animated bone and steel, the Ancient\
  \ Skeleton is completely unaffected by poison or by magic that targets the mind.\
  \ And as in the RPG, it's not impossible to take out an Ancient Skeleton with a\
  \ longbow or longsword, but a savvy adventurer will reach for the mace or sling\
  \ first. This is represented by increasing the difficulty to defeat the Skeleton—\
  listed in the circle at the upper right—from 8 (which isn't too difficult for even\
  \ starting characters) up to 11 (which is considerably harder on the unprepared)\
  \ if you're using a Slashing or Piercing weapon.</p> \n    <p>In the upper left\
  \ corner, you'll see the Ancient Skeleton has both the Undead and Skeleton traits.\
  \ Traits give us ways to have cards interact without being overburdened with special\
  \ cases. For example, Kyra, the iconic Cleric of Sarenrae, gains a bonus to checks\
  \ against cards with the Undead trait, and the item card Holy Water will help you\
  \ deal with any undead you may encounter.</p> \n    <p>The characters will explore\
  \ several locations in their hunt for Black Fang, but one in particular is likely\
  \ to cause trouble: the Desecrated Vault.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\
  \ <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/Vault1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/Vault1_120.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/Vault2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/Vault2_120.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a> \n     <br>Location:\
  \ Desecrated Vault\n    </div> \n    <p>In the Desecrated Vault, even after the\
  \ undead are overcome, they might just rise from the dead again. The PACG rules\
  \ make it simple to handle things like monsters rising, resurrecting, or magically\
  \ escaping: they are undefeated, which means they're shuffled back into the location\
  \ deck; if you continue to explore there, you may face them again.</p> \n    <p>Each\
  \ location card in the PACG represents a different part of the Pathfinder world.\
  \ Some locations are very specific, such as the Sandpoint Cathedral, while others,\
  \ like the Desecrated Vault, serve multiple duties. The vault is a great way to\
  \ add some undead flavor to a scenario. While exploring Black Fang's Dungeon, adventurers\
  \ are very likely to run into at least one undead monster here—perhaps more than\
  \ one, and perhaps more than once.</p> \n    <p>Now, let's take a look at the scenario's\
  \ big bad, Black Fang himself.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\
  /image/content/Blog/BlackFang.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/BlackFang_120.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a> \n     <br>Villain: Black Fang\n    </div> \n    <p>In developing\
  \ the PACG, we looked at various ways to represent the complex, detailed conflicts\
  \ found in Pathfinder campaigns. Many encounters are handled with a single check,\
  \ but some are more complicated. Villains such as Black Fang have a very real chance\
  \ to injure the characters, even before combat.</p> \n    <p>Dragons have always\
  \ been tricky challenges, both to design and to defeat, and even a young dragon\
  \ like Black Fang doesn't disappoint. With a Check to Defeat 50% higher than the\
  \ Ancient Skeleton, you can tell right away that this fight won't be easy. Black\
  \ Fang is a young dragon, but he's still a dragon.</p> \n    <p>Black Fang makes\
  \ his presence felt before you even begin the fight, spewing acid at every character\
  \ at his location. While particularly hardy characters such as Valeros or Harsk\
  \ might withstand the acid with ease, those who are less hale—or just unlucky—might\
  \ be in serious trouble. Damage in the PACG removes cards from your hand, so those\
  \ who succumb to Black Fang's acid breath might find themselves ill-prepared for\
  \ the fight to come.</p> \n    <p>Thanks for reading, and I hope you like the Pathfinder\
  \ Adventure Card Game. We're all very excited to see you playing it!</p> \n    <p>Chad\
