  ><i>This is the second installment of our strategy blog written by game historian\
  \ <a href=\"http://erzo.org/shannon/index.phtml\" target=\"_blank\">Shannon Appelcline</a>.\
  \ You can read the first installment <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lj3k\">here</a>.</i></p>\
  \ \n     <p>Your deck of cards is your most personal resource in the <a href=\"\
  /pathfinder/adventureCardGame\">Pathfinder Adventure Card Game</a>, and the one\
  \ you have the most control over. So how can you make the most efficient use of\
  \ it?</p> \n     <h2>Cycle Your Cards Quickly</h2> \n     <p>You want to move through\
  \ your deck quickly. That's because you'll have some cards that are notably better\
  \ than others, and you want to get to them. Even better, you want to get to them\
  \ again and again. However, cards are your second most valuable resource [<i>after\
  \ time—<a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lj3k\">see the first blog</a>!</i>], so you\
  \ don't want to just toss them all into your discard pile. How do you balance these\
  \ priorities?</p> \n     <p>You <i>cycle</i> cards, which is to say, you frequently\
  \ play cards that can be recharged. For characters including Lem (recharge to aid),\
  \ Lini (recharge your animals), Merisiel (recharge to backstab), Sajan (recharge\
  \ your blessings), Seoni (recharge your spells), and Valeros (recharge your weapons),\
  \ this comes naturally. Use their recharge powers liberally. Most of the magic users\
  \ can also recycle their spells if they're careful. For the other characters, try\
  \ and focus on rechargeable items and allies.</p> \n     <p>Oh, and recharge that\
  \ armor at the end of every turn if you can—and if you can't, pick up magic armor\
  \ and/or armor proficiency so that you can.</p> \n     <p><i>Corollary #1: Don't\
  \ wait for the perfect use of rechargeable cards.</i> It's tempting to wait forever\
  \ so that you can use your rechargeable card just when you need it most. <i>Don't.</i>\
  \ It'll clog your hand, and you may end up never using it. Yes, the card is gone\
  \ once you recharge it, but you'll have something else just as useful in your hand,\
  \ and you generally can't predict which card actually <i>will</i> be helpful on\
  \ the next turn.</p> \n     <p><i>Corollary #2:</i> <i>If you can't recharge, discard\
  \ and heal.</i> Some characters (such as Amiri, Harsk, and Seelah) just aren't that\
  \ great at recharging. But you still want to rapidly cycle their decks to get to\
  \ their great cards again and again. Accept that their method of cycling cards goes\
  \ through the discard pile: use their cards up, then have a healer ready to recycle\
  \ them.</p> \n     <h2>Discard Your Cards Quickly</h2> \n     <p>When you get a\
  \ card that doesn't look like it's going to be useful to you, don't be afraid to\
  \ discard it. This is particularly important when you acquire a boon that's not\
  \ that great. A few characters, such as Amiri (bury any card for additional dice),\
  \ Lem (recharge any card to aid), and Lini (discard any card for improved skills),\
  \ have reasons to hang onto bad cards. Absent that, toss those losers!</p> \n  \
  \   <p>You should also aggressively play useful cards like blessings, allies, and\
  \ weapons even if they're one use. Don't use them pointlessly, but do use them when\
  \ they look useful, rather than hoarding them for some future day. Use what you\
  \ have; you'll draw more!</p> \n     <p>Late in the game, you may even throw out\
  \ formerly useful cards without using them. If you think there are no more barriers\
  \ to deal with, get rid of that Masterwork Tools. If you're expecting to only support\
  \ your friend fighting the villain, toss out your own weapons in the hope of drawing\
  \ blessings.</p> \n     <p>The exception to this is, of course, when you're getting\
  \ low on cards. You don't want your character to die! However, if you're forced\
  \ to slow down, you should call over a healer so that you can quickly get up to\
  \ speed again.</p> \n     <h2>Don't Clog Your Hand</h2> \n     <p>Cycling and discarding\
  \ quickly is all about making sure that you don't clog up your hand. If you have\
  \ the same cards in your hand round after round, you're not making the most efficient\
  \ use of your resources. You <i>could</i> be using high-power cards that require\
  \ discarding or medium-power cards that require recharging, but instead you're using\
  \ low-power cards that require revealing... or maybe you're not using your cards\
  \ at all! Amiri and Seelah are among the characters most prone to this problem,\
  \ because of their lack of recharge powers, but anyone can get stuck with an immobile\
  \ hand of cards.</p> \n     <p>A good rule of thumb is that if you get to the end\
  \ of a turn and your hand is exactly the same as it was at the beginning, you need\
  \ to do something.</p> \n     <p><i>Corollary #1: Unclog your hand by playing your\
  \ cards.</i> Most obviously, you can unclog your hand by using it. You should feel\
  \ really free to recharge cards, even if doing so is a total waste. Alternatively,\
  \ you should be discarding cards for their powers.</p> \n     <p><i>Corollary #2:\
  \ Unclog your hand by discarding your cards.</i> You might flat-out discard cards\
  \ when resetting to free up your hand, particularly if you have duplicates of a\
  \ card type—usually weapons or armor.</p> \n     <p><i>Corollary #3: Unclog your\
  \ hand by moving your character.</i> If the cards in your clogged hand aren't useful\
  \ in your current location, but would be useful elsewhere, then <i>move!</i> If\
  \ you've got a handful of weapons, go somewhere with piles of monsters, and if you've\
  \ got a Crown of Charisma, go to a location that has a lot of allies, or one that\
  \ requires a Charisma check to close.</p> \n     <h2>Heal Yourself Quickly</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>In an ideal world, you'd save your healing cards until you were guaranteed\
  \ not to waste any of their potential power. It seems wasteful to play a Cure that\
  \ could heal up to five cards when you have only three cards in your discard pile!\
  \ However, the world of PACG isn't ideal, and if you choose not to use your Cure,\
  \ it's going to sit in your hand, wasting space turn after turn.</p> \n     <p>Sometimes\
  \ you should just use your Cure to keep your hand cycling, even if you might waste\
  \ some pips on the die roll. This is especially true for Kyra (who will probably\
  \ recharge her Cure and who can heal it back into her draw pile with any Divine\
  \ card if she messes up), for Lem (who can exchange any other spell for his Cure),\
  \ or for someone else with multiple healing powers.</p> \n     <p>(You might want\
  \ to be stingier if you're playing a Fighter or a Rogue that's depending on Father\
  \ Zantus for a one-time heal sometime in the game.)</p> \n     <h2>Hold On to a\
  \ Blessing</h2> \n     <p>Though you want to <i>play your cards</i> and <i>cycle\
  \ your deck</i>, don't go too far. You should try to ensure there's always one blessing\
  \ somewhere in your party. Kyra's a good person to be the Designated Blessing Holder\
  \ (DBH) if she's in the game, since she can use it for healing.</p> \n     <p>By\
  \ holding onto one blessing, you're slowing your progress a little bit, but you're\
  \ also making sure that you're ready for that great boon or that awful bane that\
  \ someone can't quite deal with on their own.</p> \n     <h2>Take Your Time if You\
  \ Have It</h2> \n     <p>Sometimes you'll play aggressively enough that your location\
  \ timer will get ahead of your blessing timer. This happens immediately in a one-player\
  \ game, where your 30 location deck cards already match the 30 blessings deck cards.\
  \ However, you can get ahead even with more players—sometimes.</p> \n     <p>When\
  \ this happens, you should start playing more slowly. Don't worry about discarding\
  \ or recharging as much. Dig more for good boons. Save your blessings to improve\
  \ rolls, not to go again.</p> \n     <p>If you start falling behind, you can always\
  \ speed up play again.</p> \n     <p><i>Next time:</i> Knowing your cards.</p> \n\
