               <blockquote>
                <p itemprop="description">A month ago, an unruly quartet of goblin heroes was unleashed on an unsuspecting populace. Yes, I said heroes. It turns out some goblins have learned the error of their ways—or, perhaps at least learned what many adventurers learn: you can steal and murder as much as you want, as long as it’s against “the bad guys.”</p>
                <p>We managed to fit 4 new characters in the Free RPG Day <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01yju/discuss?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-We-Be-Heroes">We Be Heroes? storybook</a>, but we just didn’t have enough space for role cards (also, you couldn’t use them in that storybook anyway). Thankfully, there’s this crazy thing called the internet and I hear you can post things to it. Let’s get crazy with it.</p>
                <div class="blurbCenter">
                 <img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/071919_GoblinMarkersRules.png" alt="Rules: Goblin markers. One side of each of these role cards uses goblin markers. Each character using goblin markers chooses one type of marker. (Since there are only 7 markers of each type in the game, this means that unless you have a power that allows you to steal markers, you cannot have more than 7 goblin markers on your role.)">
                 <br>
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">Speaking of crazy, I give you goblin markers!</p>
                </div>
                <p>Disclaimer: Half of the following roles use a new mechanic called goblin markers. A goblin does something it should probably be doing already and is rewarded with a marker that lets it do something else it wants to do. I’m sure nothing can go wrong here.</p>

                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">Crimsi is making a trebuchet. Will she load it with fire, rocks, or other goblins?</p>
                </div>
                <p>Let’s start with our favorite Goblin ranger, Crimsi. She’s really into inventing things, as long as “things” can fling destruction and fire about. She’ll cheerfully scout for you, but she’s easily distracted by bits of junk and fire.</p>
                <p>Arson Archer Crimsi would like you to know that she likes burning, crossbows, fire, catapults, and any other words for fire and siege weapons she hasn’t learned yet. It’s a fairly straightforward role that wants you to care about Bow and Fire cards. She can also launch goblins (including herself) to other locations with hardly any chance of serious injury.</p>
                <p>Kitbasher Crimsi likes gathering those new goblin markers together so she can bash things together, whether the result is helping, hurting, or both. Mostly both. She’s good at flinging things into fights her friends are probably in, or flinging her friends at fights, and is great at Crafting new things that will probably hurt someone.</p>

Punch one, get punched by a hundred."> </a>
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">Whether you’re into head injuries or giant bunnies, Grenek’s got you covered.</p>
                </div>
                <p>Grenek is not as tough as Amiri and has less control over his rage, as befits a goblin barbarian. He also has a habit of biting every monster he gets near.</p>
                <p>Amnesiac Grenek focuses on his head injury that sent him randomly wandering the world. He’s good at forgetting his cards to rage, wandering in the way of attacks meant for his friends, and even forgetting his scourges so well they don’t bother him anymore.</p>
                <p>Rabbitpuncher Grenek is used to adventuring in the lands of giants where bunnies grow bigger than goblins. He gets to have fun with goblin markers, potentially gaining a massive bonus to his hand size and checks, hopping about everywhere, and getting even better at biting.</p>

Those who shriek the truth will find it."> </a>
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">No, “pizazz” means alluring and charming. I don’t have any pizza!</p>
                </div>
                <p>Pizazz is good at helping his friends, like any bard. The wrinkle he runs into is that he has a genuinely fantastic singing voice... that sends goblins running away in pain. They really like when he plays his “fancy” penny whistle, though.</p>
                <p>Battlecrooner Pizazz leans into using his mellifluous voice, despite any panic it may cause nearby goblins. As a result, he makes lots of non-goblin allies that turn out to be pretty darn useful, whether he’s getting to use them more often or they’re appreciating his instrumentless crooning.</p>
                <p>Whistleblower Pizazz goes another way, embracing his goblin heritage (and markers) to whistle up bonuses and spook any upcoming monsters into fighting his goblin friends. He’s maybe a little bitter that said friends don’t appreciate his true talent, so from time to time he might steal some of their markers. (The fools won’t miss them anyway.)</p>
                <div class="blurbCenter">
                 <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/071919_Mitzi.jpg"> <img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/071919_Mitzi_360.jpeg" alt="Despite all evidence to the contrary, Siathorn sees Mitzi as a wolf -- a fuzzy, white, hairbow-wearing wolf. A wolf that likes to surprise goblins by jumping up and licking their face."> </a> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/071919_SiathornFront.jpg"> <img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/071919_SiathornFront_360.jpeg" alt="Siathorn loves her wolf Mitzi.

Because she's so very prit-zy. If you try to call her 'dog'. Then I smack you with a log!"> </a>
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">Mitzi is still the prettiest wolf. Yes, she is!</p>
                </div>
                <p>Siathorn and her fearless wolf Mitzi are still keeping the other goblins in line with Mitzi’s threatening facelicks. She’s not quite as good at druiding as Lini, but Mitzi more than makes up for that!</p>
                <div class="blurbCenter">
                 <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/071919_SiathornTreemugger.jpg"> <img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/071919_SiathornTreemugger_360.jpeg" alt="Treemugger. Protect the trees, lest you have nothing to drop goblins from."> </a> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/071919_SiathornWolfmother.jpg"> <img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/071919_SiathornWolfmother_360.jpeg" alt="Wolfmother. It licks you to know if it should eat you."><br></a>
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">Siathorn is probably going to be mercilessly hugging both trees and wolves, regardless of which role you pick.</p>
                </div>
                <p>Treemugger Siathorn easily gathers goblin markers by just playing with everyone’s animals. She then helps everyone at Wild locations and against bunches of natural banes. She’ll also make sure to heal her friends! They might need it after she steals a few of their Animal allies away from them.</p>
                <p>Wolfmother Siathorn focuses her efforts on Mitzi, as well she should. Under her care, Mitzi becomes a very effective fighting “wolf” and Siathorn figures out how to make sure she keeps her deck full of all those fun Animal cards that Mitzi likes.</p>
                <p>So, how do you get these neat roles? We’ve updated our <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy914x?Community-Use-Package-Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Character-Sheets">Character Sheet package</a> to include sheets for all four of these goblins, including their roles. And in the near future, they’ll also be available as a print-on-demand card set from our friends at DriveThru Cards. (After they go live, we’ll mention it in a future blog.)</p>
