  \     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\"><a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sght?Pathfinder-Battles-A-Huge-Announcement\"\
  >Back in February</a>, we announced the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01ztb?Pathfinder-Battles-Legendary-Adventures\"\
  >next set of Pathfinder Battles pre-painted plastic miniatures from our partners\
  \ at WizKids—Legendary Adventures</a>—and showed off a handful of the figures in\
  \ the set, including the Huge dragon turtle and some of the pieces of the <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/products/btq01ztc?Pathfinder-Battles-Legendary-Adventures-Goblin-Village-Set\"\
  >Goblin Village premium set</a> releasing at the same time. </p> \n      <p>It’\
  s been a while, but now that Pathfinder Second Edition is out and we’ve got a bit\
  \ of time to catch our breath, it’s time to look at the rest of the set, which comes\
  \ out in September.</p> \n      <p>Since we first announced that Legendary Adventures\
  \ would include Huge miniatures, one of the figures we heard the most hope for was\
  \ the aquatic alghollthu, whose meddling in the affairs of humans in ancient times\
  \ had an incredibly devastating effect on the fate of Golarion. Well, I’m happy\
  \ to report that the alghollthu is in fact in the set! With an uncommon rarity,\
  \ this staple of tabletop fantasy is sure to make a splash in campaigns across the\
  \ world.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190805-algholithu.jpg\"\

  \ alt=\"3d sculpt of an algholithu miniature: a green fish-like creature with red\
  \ fins and 4 tentacles sprouting near its front. It has three red eyes lined up\
  \ vertically in the front of its face.\"></a>\n      </div> \n      <p>One of the\
  \ challenges of assembling this set was that we knew it would be coming out after\
  \ the release of Pathfinder Second Edition, but the production lead times meant\
  \ that we had to have art references to WizKids long before the final art for the\
  \ Core Rulebook and Bestiary were in from our many artists. Breaking from our normal\
  \ operating procedures, we used concept art and character sketches—many of which\
  \ came from none other than iconic Pathfinder artist Wayne Reynolds—to make many\
  \ of the figures. Take, as an example, the kobold soldier, kobold scout, and kobold\
  \ scalecaster figures below. While we showed off kobolds’ new look back in the spring\
  \ with the formal announcement of the Pathfinder Bestiary, we worked with WizKids\
  \ to sculpt and color these figures from black-and-white sketches from Wayne last\
  \ summer. The trio of Small figures are common and uncommon in rarity and should\
  \ combine to make a memorable warband of what are sure to be a new fan favorite\
  \ ancestry.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190805-kobolds.jpg\"\

  3 kobold miniature figures. On the left, a red kobold holding a staff before him.\
  \ The staff is pointed on both ends and looks deadly. In the center, a green kobold\
  \ wields a large dagger in its left hand and a hand crossbow in its right.  On the\
  \ right, a blue kobold appears to be a spellcaster, wielding a staff high in the\
  \ air in his left hand while a blue 'glow' comes from his right.\" width=\"800\"\
  ></a>\n      </div> \n      <p>Kobolds aren’t the only draconic creatures in Legendary\
  \ Adventures, though. Check out the Huge blue dragon, a rare figure who really dominates\
  \ the battlefield with its size and intimidating features.</p> \n      <div class=\"\

  \ alt=\"Blue-scale dragon miniature, large wings unfurled.\"></a>\n      </div>\
  \ \n      <p> Along with the announcement of Legendary Adventures, we also showed\
  \ off all 8 figures in the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01ztd?Pathfinder-Battles-Legendary-Adventures-Preview-Pack\"\
  >Legendary Adventures Preview Pack</a>, available this month. Each of these figures\
  \ appears in the full set as a common figure with a new color scheme, giving collectors\
  \ twice as many options when using them in play. Here are the final versions of\
  \ the goblin dog-slicer, goblin guard, halfling slinger (all Small), orc charger,\
  \ bugbear skulker, orc battler, hobgoblin soldier, and armored elf soldier (all\
  \ Medium). </p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190805-pblap.jpg\"\

  8 miniatures shown: a goblin dog-slicer with a lowered sword in hand, goblin guard\
  \ with large bladed weapon - taller than the guard itself - resting on the ground\
  \ in hand, halfling slinger, charging orc charger, bugbear skulker with diamond\
  \ shield and mace, orc battler with sword in hand and additional arrows or spears\
  \ strapped on the back, hobgoblin soldier with hexagon shield on arm, long spear\
  \ and pointed sword in hand, and armored elf soldier holding a long sword aloft.\"\
  \ width=\"650\"></a>\n      </div> \n      <p> And since you’ve all been so patient,\
  \ here are previews of two of the \"weapon swap\" versions of figures above, which\
  \ both appear in the uncommon rarity: the goblin horse-chopper and orc rampager\
  \ (Small and Medium, respectively). </p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a\

  \ of Marketing &amp; Licensing Jim Butler and Licensing Manager Glenn Elliott showed\
  \ off some stunning pictures of the Goblin Camp premium set, which you should be\
  \ able to find on <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/officialpaizo\">Paizo’s official\
  \ Twitch channel</a> now, and on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKEdQmZIhBiPwG7SdQU9oUA\"\

  \ character figures from Legendary Adventures next week. </p> \n      <p style=\"\
