  \ Society Organized Play, Part XIX: Retuning the Rules</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\"\
  >Monday, July 25, 2011</p> \n   <p>We're just over a week away from Gen Con 2011\
  \ and the launch of Pathfinder Society Organized Play's fourth year, dubbed \"The\
  \ Year of the Ruby Phoenix\", and the entire editorial staff seems to be under the\
  \ permanent effects of <i>haste</i> and <i>insanity</i>. While I'm burning the midnight\
  \ oil from both ends (sorry 'bout the mixed metaphor, but it's accurate), I thought\
  \ I'd make a short post to preview some of the revisions to the campaign rules themselves,\
  \ as will appear in the newest version of the <i>Guide to Pathfinder Society Organized\
  \ Play</i>, which we'll have out shortly.</p> \n   <p>For full details on these\
  \ and other changes, you'll have to wait for the full rules, but here's a hint at\
  \ some of what's in store. Note that none of these rules go into effect until August\
  \ 4, 2011, when the revised Guide will actually become legal and valid.</p> \n \
  \  <ul> \n    <li>The nearly out-of-print <i>Seekers of Secrets</i> will be removed\
  \ from the Core Assumption, replaced with the brand-new <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy8g79\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Society Field Guide</i></a>, releasing at Gen Con. This book includes\
  \ new Prestige Awards unique to each of the 10 factions, new archetypes, spells,\
  \ equipment, and a section on vanities, which are purchasable with Prestige Points\
  \ and allow you to own a business or a manor house, have minions and servants to\
  \ provide you bonuses, and grant you membership into exclusive clubs like thieves'\
  \ guilds and hunting lodges.</li> \n    <li>Day Jobs are being simplified, and will\
  \ now be a single Craft, Perform, or Profession check, with all relevant modifiers.\
  \ Some vanities or Prestige Awards will allow you to use different skills for such\
  \ checks, including the much requested Sleight of Hand.</li> \n    <li>Characters\
  \ will be able to switch factions by paying Prestige Points to represent the fewer\
  \ favors their new faction owes them. All PCs will receive one free faction change\
  \ beginning on August 4 that must be used before the first session played in Season\
  \ 3. If you don't play any Pathfinder Society during Season 3, you'll have to pay\
  \ to change factions in Season 4.</li> \n    <li>New PCs will no longer be restricted\
  \ from purchasing magic items at character creation. They will still be limited\
  \ by having only 150 gp to spend on such items, and can't buy anything not on the\
  \ Always Available list, but now you can start with a scroll or a potion if you've\
  \ got the money for one!</li> \n    <li>Characters of new factions playing old scenarios\
  \ will do a faction mission from one of the original five, earning prestige as if\
  \ that mission had been tied to your faction all along. The pairings will be: Grand\
  \ Lodge &gt; Osirion; Lantern Lodge &gt; Qadira; Sczarni &gt; Taldor; Shadow Lodge\
  \ &gt; Cheliax; and Silver Crusade &gt; Andoran.</li> \n    <li>Since Season 3 will\
  \ feature only one faction mission per scenario, with a second Prestige Point tied\
  \ to the completion of the overall scenario, Season 0 scenarios with 1 Prestige\
  \ Point available can be run as written, while scenarios from Seasons 1 and 2 will\
  \ treat one faction mission as the overall objective and the other as the faction\
  \ specific objective to maintain the same 2 Prestige Points per scenario.</li> \n\
  \    <li>The Guide will also include rules for rebuilding elements of characters\
  \ using open playtest rules, or when an errata or FAQ of an existing rule causes\
  \ it to work significantly differently than before.</li> \n   </ul> \n   <p>I guess\
  \ that's about all I have time for at the moment, because I still have to get the\
  \ guide polished off and ready to go, not to mention our four new scenarios and\
  \ Gen Con special, <i>Blood Under Absalom</i>. (The art you're seeing here is a\
  \ sample of what players in these new adventures have in store, by the way.) Oh,\
  \ and revised pregens. Yeah, those are finally coming out, as well. </p> \n   <p>Next\
  \ week, in the <i>twentieth</i> and final installment of the Future of Pathfinder\
  \ Society Organized Play blog series, I'll talk a little about some of the exciting\
  \ gaming opportunities we have planned for Gen Con and reveal the heretofore unmentioned\
  \ exclusive prizes players in Pathfinder Society and Pathfinder Roleplaying Game\
  \ delve events will have a chance to win at the show!</p> \n  </blockquote> \n \
