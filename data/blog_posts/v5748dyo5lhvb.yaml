  > \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">The Open Call is over, and now it's time for\
  \ YOU to <a href=\"/rpgsuperstar\">determine our Top 32</a>! Voting will run until\
  \ 11:59 PM Pacific time on August 30th, and our Top 32 (and four alternates) will\
  \ be announced the next day. Voting is handled by presenting two random items side-by-side\
  \ to a voter, and having the voter select which is better. Over the course of thousands\
  \ of votes, we'll sort through all the entries and determine which are most popular\
  \ with the voters. Every couple of days we'll cull the lowest percentage of vote-getting\
  \ items so they don't keep showing up, which should both keep the voting process\
  \ more interesting for voters, and give us a better field of final items.</p> \n\
  \     <p>Since we are determining our Top 32 using just the public voting this year,\
  \ the kind of contest we have is very much up to the fan-base. You can use any metric\
  \ you wish to determine which items get your votes, but I strongly suggest you include\
  \ asking yourself \"would I want to buy a product written mostly by the designer\
  \ who created this item?\" There's nothing wrong with personal preferences, but\
  \ remember that at the end of the day, we need someone who can actually write RPG\
  \ products you want! We're trusting you to find them. We hope you'll take that trust\
  \ seriously.</p> \n     <p>As a more specific voting consideration, voters should\
  \ keep in mind that the official template presented with the Open Call rules didn't\
  \ provide the BBCode tags to have spells listed as prerequisites be italicized.\
  \ Since the proper format for such items as presented in the Core Rulebooks (referenced\
  \ by the Open Call rules) is to italicize spell names, voters shouldn't penalize\
  \ contestants who did so. Since the formatted entry offered in the open call rules\
  \ lacked this, voters also shouldn't penalize contestants who didn't italicize spell\
  \ names in the prerequisites section.</p> \n     <p>While of our Open Call judges\
  \ are already looking at many of the entries, their detailed comments on each item\
  \ wouldn't be put up until we have determined our Top 32. It'll likely take a few\
  \ days, so we ask fans and contestants to be patient when Round 1 ends. We will\
  \ get feedback to all our Top 32, it just won't be immediate. Subsequent rounds\
  \ will function as they have in the past, with judges' comments presented as each\
  \ voting period opens.</p> \n     <p>Speaking of subsequent rounds, contestants\
  \ who want to begin work on round 2 should note that the maps this year are the\
  \ same scale as Paizo's Flip-Mats, a 24 x 30 square grid with a 1 square = 5 feet\
  \ scale that represents an encounter area. We'll provide a grid to download before\
  \ round 2 starts (hopefully later this week). Each map should use the entire grid\
  \ area in a useful and interesting way, provide all the details a professional cartographer\
  \ needs to create a complete, engaging, useful encounter map, and should include\
  \ a compass rose (in all cases) and legend (where appropriate), even though Paizo\
  \ flip-maps don't normally have either. We don't care if you draw and scan your\
  \ maps, use mapping software, or draw it within illustration programs, as long as\
  \ the final entry matches the dpi and scale we'll list in the official rules.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>These maps should present encounter areas that makes GMs itch with ideas\
  \ for interesting challenges to run their players through. In addition to the map's\
  \ name, each entry may have up to 50 words of prose to help provide context for\
  \ the map, though this kind of description isn't required. The maps need not be\
  \ publication quality, and the judges aren't rating maps based on artistic merit.\
  \ However, the maps do have to be concise, easily understood, and presenting enough\
  \ details to allow a cartographer to know exactly what the end product of each map\
  \ is supposed to look like.</p> \n     <p>There's no specific theme for the map\
  \ this year, and while the official Round 2 rules (which will be posted prior to\
  \ Round 2 officially beginning) take precedence over this blog post, we aren't planning\
  \ any last-minute twists to the rules.</p> \n     <p>I want to thank everyone involved\
  \ in this contest for making <a href=\"/rpgsuperstar\">RPG Superstar Season 9</a>\
  \ possible. Obviously the staff and judges are doing in a lot of work over the course\
  \ of the contest, and the contestants have put their creations out in the public\
  \ eye, but I want to thank the voters as well. Going over entries, considering their\
  \ merits, taking the time to vote, and even getting involved on the contest messageboards\
  \ is often an otherwise thankless task, but without that effort there'd be no point\
  \ in having a contest. We all appreciate the time and effort our fans put into the\
  \ contest every year, and we hope you'll all be thrilled by the end result.</p>\
