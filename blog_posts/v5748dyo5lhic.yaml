  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">by Josh Vogt</p> \n   <h2>Chapter Two: Shaken Foundations</h2>\
  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Akina trailed\
  \ Ondorum across the main threshold, which he said the hobgoblins had been using\
  \ to come and go. The air turned chilly and musty, with an underlying reek that\
  \ flared the embers in Akina's gut—a fetid mix of blood, grease, dung, and rotting\
  \ meat unique to hobgoblins. It conjured up too-fresh memories of their hideous\
  \ warcries and how they'd clamber over the corpses of allies and foes alike to slaughter\
  \ all in their path.</p> \n    <p>Once they left the sunlight behind, all color\
  \ washed away into shades of gray. Ondorum navigated the darkness without stumbling,\
  \ so she figured he could see as well as her or had some monkish sensitivity that\
  \ guided him. At least he wouldn't be a liability that way.</p> \n    <p>The initial\
  \ hall ended in what once might've been a large meeting chamber. Portions of the\
  \ ceiling had collapsed, blocking off stretches with earth-packed debris. Side halls\
  \ and chambers offered themselves on either side, while cracked columns stood in\
  \ rows. A few sections of the floor had broken, gaping holes hinting at lower levels.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Akina kept a steady watch as they advanced, eager for the beasts to attack\
  \ and end any pretense at peace. Sure, there was the gold to be gotten by laying\
  \ them low, but this job went deeper than that for her. Since the war ended, surviving\
  \ hobgoblins and their ilk had scattered to every pit they could crawl into. It\
  \ was time to claim vengeance for those who'd fallen before their hordes. So many\
  \ friends to remember. So many faces locked in death masks, covered in blood or\
  \ ravaged beyond recognition.</p> \n    <p>\"You never told me your name.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Hm?\" She roused from her morbid recollections. \"Oh. Akina.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Ondorum skirted rubble. \"Just that? I thought dwarves identified with\
  \ their families or clans.\"</p> \n    <p>\"We're working together to scatter a\
  \ few beasts, not compare bloodlines.\"</p> \n    <p>\"They're not mindless beasts,\
  \ you know.\"</p> \n    <p>She snorted. \"True. They're worse. They're savages just\
  \ smart enough to be deadly, and there's only one way to deal with savages. Where\
  \ are they, anyway? I thought you arranged a meeting.\"</p> \n    <p>Ondorum surveyed\
  \ the chamber with a frown. \"I believe your arrival spooked them. No doubt they've\
  \ retreated a bit. Hopefully we can contact them and explain the misunderstanding.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Misunderstanding? Funny way to describe raids and butchery.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"These claim they took no part in the war.\"</p> \n    <p>\"You believe\
  \ them?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Until there's evidence to the contrary, I try to give others\
  \ the benefit of the doubt.\"</p> \n    <p>\"How are you even still alive? You're\
  \ either really lucky or—\" Akina hesitated. Had that been a faint chuckle just\
  \ then? A pebble clattering? She inspected the dismal chamber. </p> \n    <p>\"\
  Come out,\" she said. \"No point in hiding.\"</p> \n    <p>A wheedling voice trickled\
  \ over. \"I hides so you not kill me.\"</p> \n    <p>\"We won't kill you,\" Ondorum\
  \ said. \"There's nothing to be afraid of.\"</p> \n    <p>Akina barely sealed a\
  \ Says you behind her lips.</p> \n    <p>A creature even shorter than her hopped\
  \ into view from behind a pile of rocks and stood just on the other side of a set\
  \ of columns. Its melon-shaped head wobbled on a spindly neck while its grin revealed\
  \ dozens of needle-sharp teeth. Filthy rags draped a scrawny body.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Hello!\" it said. \"Are you my dinner?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Goblin.\" Akina hunched,\
  \ gripping her maulaxe in both hands. \"Keep an eye out.\"</p> \n    <p>Ondorum\
  \ glanced her way. \"You fear this creature?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Not afraid of anything,\"\
  \ she said. \"But I'm not stupid, either. Goblins are like roaches. Where there's\
  \ one, there's a hundred waiting to stick you from behind.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Roaches!\"\
  \ The goblin picked up several stones and juggled them, the columns framing its\
  \ display. \"Loves me crunchy roaches. So tasty.\" It giggled. \"But it just me.\
  \ Me and the biggies. But the biggies no share their food and I—\" The goblin's\
  \ voice lowered several octaves, grating across Akina's ears. </p> \n    <p>\"I\
  \ am quite famished.\"</p> \n    <p>It flung the stones at them with surprising\
  \ speed. Ondorum snagged two from midair while the third pinged off Akina's helm.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Something's wrong here.\" Akina growled and stepped forward. \"I'll\
  \ fill your gut with—\"</p> \n    <p>Pressure against her shin made her freeze,\
  \ but too late. A near-invisible cord stretched across the way. Even as she backpedaled,\
  \ a rumbling noise shook the chamber and the cord went slack. </p> \n    <p>Mouth\
  \ wide in shrieking laughter, the goblin cartwheeled aside as the two columns crumbled\
  \ and fell toward Akina and Ondorum. </p> \n    <p>They dove in opposite directions,\
  \ and the crash rattled Akina's bones. She raised her head to see the toppled columns\
  \ had set off a chain reaction throughout the chamber. Sections of the floor dropped\
  \ away into pits. The ceiling sagged as more columns collapsed, and fresh dirt sifted\
  \ down through gaps where walls had collapsed. </p> \n    <p>She looked up just\
  \ as a slab as big as she was dropped from above. Akina raised an arm in pointless\
  \ defense.</p> \n    <p>Ondorum appeared, standing over her with palms toward the\
  \ ceiling. The slab slammed into his upraised hands and he held it aloft, teeth\
  \ gritted with effort.</p> \n    <p>\"Showoff,\" she muttered.</p> \n    <p>With\
  \ a grunt, he heaved the stone away. She ignored his proffered hand and grabbed\
  \ her maulaxe, using it to brace herself back to her feet. Ondorum placed a hand\
  \ on her shoulder and she almost knocked it away until he pointed out wider cracks\
  \ spreading through the chamber ceiling. Whatever trap the goblin had laid, it'd\
  \ been thorough.</p> \n    <p>\"We should make haste,\" he said.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Yeah. Let's do that.\"</p> \n    <p>He dashed ahead while she clomped after. Rocks\
  \ clattered off her helm and pauldrons, and she knocked away others. Ondorum stayed\
  \ just ahead, weaving through the falling rubble. It almost looked like he knew\
  \ just where the stones would fall and shifted half a second before or half a step\
  \ far enough to let them plummet past.</p> \n    <p>He aimed for a wide hall at\
  \ the far end of the chamber, Akina grumbled as she tried to keep up. Clumps of\
  \ earth pounded into the floor, plenty enough to bury her if a collapse happened\
  \ right on her head.</p> \n    <p>\"Hello!\" The goblin screeched as it appeared\
  \ a few feet away, popping into being from nowhere to wave a claw. \"Goodbye!\"\
  \ It snapped out a round object at her face.</p> \n    <p>Thinking it another rock,\
  \ Akina raised her maulaxe to knock it aside. At the last second, she realized it\
  \ glinted like glass rather than stone.</p> \n    <p>The flask shattered against\
  \ her weapon. Akina stumbled back, barely closing her eyes in time as the cloud\
  \ of flame enveloped her. She struck a wall and hit the floor, maulaxe tumbling\
  \ from her hands. Lurching upright, she slapped herself all over to smother the\
  \ droplets of liquid fire that had splattered her armor and burned like white-hot\
  \ sparks on her exposed face.</p> \n    <p>She opened her eyes, stinging from the\
  \ foul smoke. Flames lit the chamber in sickly yellow. She scrambled to her feet\
  \ and snatched up her maulaxe, ready to bash the goblin's head in. At last, she\
  \ spotted the creature grinning at her from the opposite side of a growing crack\
  \ in the floor that rent the chamber in two. When she blinked grit from her eyes,\
  \ the creature seemed to puff away into thin air.</p> \n    <p>As stones tumbled\
  \ into the widening gap, Akina turned and threw herself through the hall's archway,\
  \ where Ondorum had already taken refuge. He caught her arm so she didn't tumble\
  \ down the flight of stairs beyond. A final clatter and crash announced rock and\
  \ dirt blocking the way they'd come. </p> \n    <p>Once the dust cleared, Akina\
  \ eyed the hall at the bottom of the stairs, little more than a tunnel cutting down\
  \ into the earth. She assumed more temple ruins waited within the hillside.</p>\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Not all goblins are as weak as they appear.</i>\n    </div>\
  \ \n    <p>She hacked against the acrid fumes lingering in the air. After clearing\
  \ her throat, she cupped hands around her mouth and shouted down.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  That's it! I'm mashing every last one of you mongrels to pulp. Hear me? I'm wiping\
  \ out the whole lot of you!\"</p> \n    <p>Ondorum winced as the echoes faded. \"\
  We agreed to try the diplomatic approach first.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Sorry. I forgot.\"\
  \ Turning back to the tunnel, she hollered again. \"I'll be sure to wipe you out\
  \ diplomatically!\" She raised a hand to the monk. \"Better?\"</p> \n    <p>He sighed.\
  \ \"You hold much anger.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Nearly getting buried alive brings it\
  \ out in me. Forget your parley. That little attempt on our lives should prove these\
  \ creatures don't have a smidge of honor.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Perhaps it's our role\
  \ to show them a better way,\" he said. \"Even if others refuse to live with integrity\
  \ and honor and mercy, we should still strive for such. Otherwise we risk losing\
  \ touch with our true selves. Our higher selves.\"</p> \n    <p>Akina leveled a\
  \ flat look. \"Higher selves? Was that a short joke?\"</p> \n    <p>His eyes widened.\
  \ \"I meant no offense. I simply—\" </p> \n    <p>She huffed. \"What'd I say about\
  \ having a sense of humor?\" She lead the way down the stairs. \"Besides, it costs\
  \ too much.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Humor?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Mercy.\"</p> \n    <p>\"What\
  \ does mercy cost?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Focus. The advantage in a fight. Lives.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Some prices are worth paying.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Not this one.\" She\
  \ blew dust from her nostrils. \"Sounds like you've already forgotten that I've\
  \ fought more of their kind than I can count. I've seen how they really are. Every\
  \ single one I killed would've returned the favor if I'd shown them so much as a\
  \ speck of mercy.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I haven't forgotten,\" he said. \"I simply feel\
  \ it's rash to judge any species as a whole by one representative, or judge any\
  \ individual on the actions of others. Would you have me judge all dwarves by your\
  \ example?\"</p> \n    <p>She groaned. \"Would you please stop?\"</p> \n    <p>His\
  \ brow furrowed. \"Stop what?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Talking. It's annoying.\" </p> \n\
  \    <p>They emerged into a smaller, rounded room with old cracks spearing every\
  \ which way through the stone floor. Several passages fed away from it, and Akina\
  \ studied them while trying to shrug off Ondorum's words. Her, acting like a dwarven\
  \ representative? Ridiculous. Hard enough to just be her old self, these days. Hopefully\
  \ she could keep a cap on the bloodthirsty fury that kept flaring through her veins,\
  \ rather than losing herself to it again. She wanted clarity when she ended the\
  \ hobgoblins—cold satisfaction as she killed each one. Not like during the war.\
  \ Especially not in front of this infuriating monk who clearly thought himself the\
  \ lone voice of reason in a world gone mad. </p> \n    <p>\"You losties?\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>A goblin peeped out from the passage on the far right. The same one, as\
  \ far as she could tell. How had it gotten down there?</p> \n    <p>\"You little\
  \ slimespit.\" She shook her maulaxe. \"Get over here. I got a really funny joke\
  \ to tell you.\"</p> \n    <p>\"No thanks!\" Without moving, the goblin vanished.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Akina stared. Since when could goblins turn invisible? She rushed for\
  \ the spot where it had just crouched, determined to corner it before it could pull\
  \ other tricks. </p> \n    <p>\"Wait,\" Ondorum cried. \"I don't think—\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>A loud clang halted her. She glanced behind. A circular cage had dropped\
  \ from a hidden slot in the ceiling. Ondorum stood encased, looking abashed.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"That was unexpected.\"</p> \n    <p>He tested the bronze bars. Nothing\
  \ budged. Akina went over and gave it a few good whacks, sending gongs through the\
  \ chamber, but the bottom had somehow glued itself to the stone floor. Ondorum gripped\
  \ the base and tried to heft the whole thing, giving up after several straining\
  \ attempts that didn't so much as shift a pebble. The cracks in the floor had fractured\
  \ further under the impact, but otherwise the trap appeared immovable. </p> \n \
  \   <p>Breathing hard, he sat in the center of the cage, legs folded, hands propped\
  \ on his knees. \"I will meditate on this dilemma. There's always a solution.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"You do that,\" she said. \"I'll go find our little friend and have\
  \ a nice chat.\"</p> \n    <p>\"We's friends?\"</p> \n    <p>She whirled to find\
  \ the goblin standing just down the hall it had appeared in before. Akina tensed\
  \ for it to attack with a dozen of its vile friends, but it just stared at her.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Run out of tricks, have you? Right. I'm smearing you so thin you'll—\
  \"</p> \n    <p>Her nostrils flared, picking up the creature's stench. She'd had\
  \ goblin stink rammed up her nose often enough she could pick it out of the smelliest\
  \ crowd or most chaotic battlefield. A scratchy scent of urine and sour sap.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>This creature emanated a muskier odor. Beyond that, its shadow looked\
  \ wrong. It formed a broad pool of darkness, giving the appearance of a hunched\
  \ animal readying to spring rather than a stick-limbed goblin. Now that she thought\
  \ of it, how did it cast a shadow in the lightless space?</p> \n    <p>The goblin's\
  \ grin went impossibly wide, even for its huge mouth. The deeper, more eloquent\
  \ voice vibrated out again.</p> \n    <p>\"Join me for a meal, won't you?\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Its body rippled and swelled, blocking the passage with fur and fangs.</p>\
