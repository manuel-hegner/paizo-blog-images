  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Friday, May 22, 2009</p> \n   <p>After I started my internship\
  \ at Paizo, one of the things I found really intriguing was seeing how the pros\
  \ did thingsâ€”little things, really, like how they pronounce tarrasque, for example.\
  \ Then it occurred to me that most people who roleplay often never experience anything\
  \ outside of their own group of players, so I figured maybe some of you might be\
  \ as interested as I am in knowing how the pros GM, so I whipped up some questions\
  \ for the folks here at Paizo. </p> \n   <p><i>1. When you call for your players\
  \ to roll Perception checks, do you pull those who succeed aside, or do you simply\
  \ look at them and say, \"You see/hear...?\"</i></p> \n   <p><b>Lisa Stevens</b>:\
  \ I just do it in front of everybody. I trust my players, they're all pros. But\
  \ sometimes I might do it just to see how someone will react or to see how someone\
  \ might attempt to convey the same message to the rest of the group. It becomes\
  \ really interesting when two players' characters are a bit antagonistic with each\
  \ other; it's fun if one player makes the roll, but the other doesn't. I like to\
  \ give that player the info just to see if he'll share the info, and if he doesn't,\
  \ how the other player might react.</p> \n   <p><b>F. Wesley Schneider</b>: Depends\
  \ on the situation. If it's something more epic, I've found that it is much more\
  \ exciting and suspenseful when a player reveals the information than the Game Master.</p>\
  \ \n   <p><b>James Jacobs</b>: I just say it in front of everyone.</p> <b></b>\n\
  \   <p><b>Erik Mona</b>: That really depends on the dramatic tension. If it isn't\
  \ very important, or it will just slow the game down, then no. But if a player has\
  \ a different agenda than the rest of the group, then certainly.</p> \n   <p><b>Jason\
  \ Bulmahn</b>: Depends. If it's a situation where the results aren't immediately\
  \ obvious I might, but if it's a situation where a monster is about to jump out\
  \ and attack and everyone will know in just a few seconds anyway, then I just say\
  \ it.</p> <b></b>\n   <p><b>Sean K Reynolds</b>: Tell everyone and trust people\
  \ not to metagame.</p> <b></b>\n   <p><b>Joshua J. Frost</b>: I just say it in front\
  \ of everybody.</p> <b></b>\n   <p><b>James Sutter</b>: In front of everybody; I\
  \ trust my players and depend on player honesty.</p> <b></b>\n   <p><b>Chris Self</b>:\
  \ Everyone. I trust my players to keep player knowledge and character knowledge\
  \ separate. Besides, with things like Perception checks, everyone will know it within\
  \ moments anyway.</p> \n   <p><i>This first question is something I've often wondered\
  \ how other groups handled. For me, I've often just said, \"All right, <i>you two</i>\
  \ see...,\" but after a while, I started to think, \"Man... this is almost a waste\
  \ of time having them roll at all, since at least one person always succeeds! It's\
  \ good to know I'm not the only one who plays this way.</i></p> \n   <p>Hank Woon\
