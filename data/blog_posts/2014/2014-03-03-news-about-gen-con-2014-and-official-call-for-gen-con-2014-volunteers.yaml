  >For Gen Con 2013, I advised last year that we planned to make it the biggest and\
  \ best Gen Con yet. And it certainly was. We scheduled 1,400 tables of Pathfinder\
  \ Society over the four days. We showed the world our GM 101 and GM 201 workshops,\
  \ Kid's Beginner &amp; Advanced Tracks, and Beginner Box Introductions, Parts 1\
  \ and 2. Gen Con was definitely a success and Paizo's biggest showing in history.\
  \ But we can make it bigger and better!</span></p>\n             <p>Paizo will once\
  \ again be a cosponsor at this year's show. What does that mean for Pathfinder Society?\
  \ It means we return to the Sagamore Ballroom! We increase our playspace size, scheduling\
  \ 150 to 170 tables per slot. Additionally, we also have two of the seven rooms\
  \ that were used for Pathfinder Society last year. One of them will be used exclusively\
  \ for Paizo seminars. The other room will have 10 tables and will be utilized for\
  \ <em>Pathfinder Adventure Card Game</em> play.</p>\n             <p>We are planning\
  \ to schedule 20 different scenarios, two Gen Con Specials, one Gen Con Exclusive,\
  \ and two modules, <em>We Be Goblins!</em> and <em>We Be Goblins Too!</em> throughout\
  \ the course of the convention.</p>\n             <p>The beginning of Season 6 Gen\
  \ Con Special, <em>The Paths We Choose</em>, scheduled for Thursday night, will\
  \ help us kick off Season 6 by showing off the achievements of many of the factions'\
  \ Season 5 goals. As a tease, here is the short description as it will appear in\
  \ the Gen Con catalog:</p>\n             <p><em>The failure of Mendev's wardstones\
  \ set in motion not only a new crusade, but also catalyzed a change in the Society's\
  \ various factions.</em></p>\n             <p>More information on the factions and\
  \ surpirses upcoming will be offered in a series of blog posts later this year.\
  \ This special is designed for levels 3—7.</p>\n             <p>The end of Season\
  \ 5 Gen Con Special, <em>Legacy of the Stonelords</em>, scheduled for Friday night,\
  \ will help us close Season 5 inside the Worldwound!</p>\n             <p>As a tease,\
  \ here is the long description as it will appear in the Gen Con catalog:</p>\n \
  \            <p><em>At long last, the Pathfinders have reached the lost Sky Citadel\
  \ Jormurdun only to find it already occupied by fiends and subterranean foes. The\
  \ Society must mount an epic offense to explore the immense subterranean city while\
  \ simultaneously driving off the squatters within. If they succeed, the Pathfinders\
  \ may discover that the greatest prize is not the mountain fortress itself but the\
  \ treasure that lies at its heart. The adventure concludes Season 5, Year of the\
  \ Demon.</em></p>\n             <p>This Special is designed for levels 1—11.</p>\n\
  \             <p>The scenarios being scheduled for Gen Con are as follows:</p>\n\

  \     </ul>\n             <p>We will be offering one exclusive on Saturday night.\
  \ We will follow up <em>Ruins of Bonekeep, Levels 1 and 2</em>, with <em>Bonekeep,\
  \ Level 3: The Wakening Tomb</em> also written by Jason. It is being designed for\
  \ Tier 5—9 characters and again, will be particularly challenging and lethal. <em>Ruins\
  \ of Bonekeep, Level 3</em> will make its debut at Gen Con. We will only run level\
  \ three one time at Gen Con so it will be a truly limited and exclusive event. On\
  \ a side note, we will have a few tables running all three of the new Season 6 scenarios\
  \ if you would rather not participate in this exclusive.</p>\n             <p>In\
  \ regard to the Beginner Box Introductions, we have two different offerings again\
  \ this year. During seven slots at Gen Con, we are setting aside six tables for\
  \ these Beginner Box Introduction events. Both parts are scheduled with new players\
  \ in mind. For Beginner Box Introductions, Part 1, it will allow for the first 45—\
  60 minutes to be an exploration of the contents of the <em><em>Pathfinder RPG Beginner\
  \ Box</em></em>, explaining the rules, and reviewing the pregenerated characters.\
  \ The final 4 hours of each slot will be playing through the four, 1-hour adventures.\
  \ For Beginner Box Introductions, Part 2, the GM will assist players in advancing\
  \ their character to third level. The <em>Beginner Box Transitions</em>, <em>Player\
  \ Pack</em>, and <em>GM Kit</em> will be reviewed. Once those three free documents\
  \ have been briefly covered, we will be offering up five 1-hour adventures as time\
  \ permits. Much like the four adventures in part one, these will be utilizing only\
  \ the <em>Beginner Box</em> rules.</p>\n             <p>For the Pathfinder's Kids'\
  \ Track, we will be setting aside six tables at seven slots during the convention.\
  \ We are focusing on players aged 6—12 and we will be using the <em>Pathfinder RPG\
  \ Beginner Box</em> for this as well. The Kids' Track is divided into two parts:\
  \ the Beginner Track and the Advanced Track. Each kid's beginner track slot will\
  \ be 2 hours long and each player will receive a check-off card. The first hour\
  \ of each of the seven Kids' Beginner Track sessions teaches roleplay and rules,\
  \ and reviews the pregenerated characters found in the <em>Pathfinder RPG Beginner\
  \ Box</em>. During the second hour, one of the four, 1-hour adventures used during\
  \ the Beginner Box Bash will be played.</p>\n             <p>For the Kids' Advanced\
  \ Track, we are focusing on children who participated in last year's Kids' Beginner\
  \ Track, at a local Kids' Beginner Track session near their home, or for older children\
  \ that have prior experience with <em>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game</em>. The GM at\
  \ each of the 2-hour slots will help the children level their chosen character to\
  \ third level. After leveling is complete, the GM will run one of five new adventures\
  \ designed using the <em>Beginner Box</em> rules.</p>\n             <p>We will be\
  \ running each of the nine different adventures multiple times throughout the convention\
  \ to allow flexible scheduling for children and parents. We will be restricting\
  \ tables to four children players and are requiring a parent or guardian be present\
  \ with their child (or multiple children if they have two or more interested in\
  \ participating) for the entire 2 hours. The parent or guardian will assist the\
  \ child when needed. But, we want to make this a good and memorable experience for\
  \ the kids that attend Gen Con, who often find little they can participate in, especially\
  \ with others their own age. We will be scheduling 24, 2-hour tables per day on\
  \ Thursday through Saturday, and 12, 2-hour tables on Sunday, for the Kids' Track,\
  \ divided between the Beginner and Advanced Tracks.</p>\n             <p>If a child\
  \ plays all four different adventures in the Beginner's Track, he will be able to\
  \ present his check-off card to HQ and receive a special certificate that celebrates\
  \ his accomplishments. If a child plays all five different adventures in the advanced\
  \ track, she will be able to present her check-off card to HQ and receive a second,\
  \ different special certificate. Both certificates can be used on the child's Pathfinder\
  \ Society character if they did to advance from the <em>Beginner Box</em> to the\
  \ full <em>Core Rulebook</em> rules and participate in Pathfinder Society Organized\
  \ Play. We may also have other give-aways or special prizes, such as dice and miniatures,\
  \ similar to last year. <b>I will be very picky when choosing volunteer GMs for\
  \ the Kids' Track</b>. I prefer to have school teachers and other professionals\
  \ with experience dealing with children. I will consider GMs who are parents even\
  \ if they do not deal with children regularly in their profession. If you are volunteering\
  \ to GM the Kids' Track, please make sure to include all of your credentials. Also,\
  \ since these are scheduled as 2-hour blocks, a GM will be required to run two Kids'\
  \ Track slots back to back in a 4-hour block to count as one slot of credit toward\
  \ GM rewards.</p>\n             <p>We will be running a new set of Pathfinder Quests\
  \ inside the Sagamore and I do have a very few spots of 5-hour blocks for any GM\
  \ interested in running those for players as they show up and fill the quests tables.</p>\n\
  \             <p>We are also bringing back the popular GM 101 and GM 201 seminars\
  \ and need instructors to oversee the running of both. Both seminars will be offered\
  \ on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.</p>\n             <p>Finally, I need volunteers\
  \ who have experience with the <em><em>Pathfinder Adventure Card Game</em></em>,\
  \ to run demos in the Dealer Hall next to Paizo's booth, as well as run tables in\
  \ a break out room next to Paizo's Seminar Room, from 8 a.m. until midnight Thursday\
  \ through Saturday, and from 9 a.m. until 2 p.m. on Sunday. You can volunteer to\
  \ work one or two 5-hour blocks each day from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. (Sunday ends at 4\
  \ pm) in the Dealer Hall. Volunteering for any demo time will count toward your\
  \ GM reward credit below, but you still must have a minimum of seven, 5-hour sessions\
  \ to qualify for a hotel room as a Tier 2 volunteer.</p>\n             <p>Now, let's\
  \ talk about the GMs and volunteers we need to pull all of the above off and make\
  \ it the biggest and best Gen Con ever.</p>\n             <p>I need a minimum of\
  \ 350 volunteer GMs for Pathfinder Society games, Beginner Box Introductions, Kids'\
  \ Track events, GM 101 and 201, and <em>Pathfinder Adventure Card Game</em> demos.\
  \ I'll continue taking volunteer GMs until the slots are filled, at which point\
  \ I will create a waiting list in the event that a scheduled GM has to cancel their\
  \ Gen Con trip for whatever reason. I also need a few Volunteer Assistants for each\
  \ slot of the show. These folks will not GM during their volunteer slots, but will\
  \ instead help me run Pathfinder Society HQ, including marshalling, collecting tickets,\
  \ distributing GM packs, entering tracking sheets into the database, and will be\
  \ our go-to guys and gals for all things Pathfinder Society. Keep in mind these\
  \ are very limited and likely to fill up in the first hour after the blog goes live.</p>\n\
  \             <p>Below you will find the reward structure for volunteering at Gen\
  \ Con 2014. Keep in mind that you're volunteering for slots, not a specific event.\
  \ Those that are able to spice up their event by adding 3-D terrain, props that\
  \ stand out and the like, will be given first consideration for specific events.\
  \ I will let you know the slots and scenarios you have been assigned as soon as\
  \ possible. You may designate what tier scenarios you wish to GM but this is not\
  \ guaranteed to be filled. I will do the best I can to accommodate your requests.\
  \ My target date to have all GMs their assigned schedules is April 4. This should\
  \ allow you plenty of time to plan a schedule, before the May 18 event registration,\
  \ with your friends and family who are also attending Gen Con 2014. Please let me\
  \ know via email which days you will be at the convention and how many slots you\

  \     <h2>Volunteer Tiers and Rewards</h2>\n             <h3>Tier 1 GM Volunteers</h3>\n\
  \             <p>Tier 1 GM volunteers are invaluable to making the show a success.\

  \ feel free to volunteer for more than 8 slots if they so desire. I only have room\
  \ for 160 Tier 1 GM volunteers so don't delay in volunteering for this tier. Volunteers\
  \ will be chosen on a first-come, first-served basis, though I reserve the right\
  \ to select volunteers who have previously worked for Paizo over new volunteers.\
  \ <b>Please do not volunteer for Tier 1 if you have any doubts that you won't be\
  \ able to attend the show.</b> Tier 1 GMs receive:</p>\n             <ul>\n    \

  \              <p>Again, please be specific about what days and how many slots you\
  \ are volunteering for. I will assign folks to slots and scenarios on an as-needed\
  \ basis. I will update the needs in the thread below as I receive volunteers, so\
  \ you may look there to remain up to date on where we still need help. You must\
  \ have a gencon.com account and you must include your email tied to your Gen Con\
  \ account in your email or I won't be able to get you a badge (obviously this is\
  \ only for volunteers who are volunteering for 5 or more slots). Include your Paizo.com\
  \ email account so I can make sure you receive the scenarios in your downloads.\
  \ Finally, I need to know if you have received the purple goblin Pathfinder Society\
  \ volunteer shirst in the past. If not, I need to know what size.</p>\n        \
  \      <p>The time slots are as follows:</p>\n              <blockquote>\n     \
  \          <p>Slot 1: Thursday 8 A.M. to 1 P.M.</p>\n               <p>Slot 2: Thursday\
