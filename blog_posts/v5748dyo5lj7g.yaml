  ><em>Pathfinder Worldscape #1</em></a>, the first issue of my new comic series that\
  \ teams up Pathfinder's iconic heroes with the likes of Red Sonja, John Carter of\
  \ Mars, and Tarzan, comes out TODAY. As I write this, early reviews are already\
  \ hitting the internet, and I'm thrilled with the positive response so far. Most\
  \ of the commentary up to this point has focused on the comic book story itself,\
  \ but here in my weekly Worldscape Workbook column, I like to focus on the RPG rules\
  \ elements of each issue, and let you into my head a bit about some of the design\
  \ decisions I made when adapting the Worldscape guest stars to the official Pathfinder\
  \ RPG rules presented in each issue's appendix.</p> \n     <p>The first hero to\
  \ get a full Pathfinder conversion is Red Sonja, who also features prominently in\
  \ issue #1's story. Previous columns in this space have discussed Red Sonja's class,\
  \ armor (or lack thereof), and adventuring gear. This week I want to discuss the\
  \ \"meat\" of what makes Sonja different from other rangers, her archetype.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>My desire to create credible \"no armor\" martial archetypes goes back\
  \ to the very beginning, when Paizo Creative Director James Jacobs launched the\
  \ first-ever Pathfinder campaign in our office conference room. I decided to play\
  \ a barbarian named Ostog the Unslain, who in the years since has become a bit of\
  \ a Pathfinder celebrity character, if only because I keep shilling for him (he\
  \ never did die over more than 7 years of active gaming, after all).</p>\n     <p>\
  \ </p>\n     <p>In addition to being a great big gaming nerd, I'm also a book collector,\
  \ and my shelves at home bulge with hundreds and hundreds of vintage sci-fi and\
  \ fantasy paperbacks. Frank Frazetta's iconic portrayal of the bare-chested Conan\
  \ the Barbarian made a huge impact on the paperback market of the 70s, and unarmored\
  \ dudes in loincloths (and a few ladies following their example) basically took\
  \ over sword &amp; sorcery book covers for a decade or more. I wanted my barbarian\
  \ to come from this \"no armor\" tradition, but in 2008, the options for pulling\
  \ off such a character effectively using the Pathfinder RPG rules were essentially\
  \ non-existent. I lobbied Pathfinder Lead Designer Jason Bulmahn—hard—to include\
  \ a no-armor barbarian archetype in the <a href=\"/products/btpy8fo1\"><em>Pathfinder\
  \ RPG Advanced Player's Guide</em></a>, and the savage barbarian was born.</p> \n\
  \     <p>Previous Worldscape Workbooks have covered why Dynamite's version of Red\
  \ Sonja isn't a barbarian, though, so no matter how effective Jason's archetype\
  \ had been for Ostog, it didn't do me much good to use it for Red Sonja. Instead,\
  \ I looked at the armor power of the savage barbarian and the armor class feature\
  \ of the monk to create something totally new: the sword-devil.</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ name of Red Sonja's archetype hearkens back to her classic \"She-Devil with a\
  \ Sword\" appellation, only with the numbers rubbed off a bit so that Pathfinder\
  \ can use it independent of a formal Red Sonja license. We'll eventually add all\
  \ of the non-proprietary rules in these Worldscape appendices to the PRD and to\
  \ tools like Herolab, though it make take until the release of the final hardcover\
  \ collection of all six issues early in 2017. Right now the best place to get these\
  \ rules is in the Worldscape RPG appendices in each issue.</p> \n     <p>I don't\
  \ want to get into too many specifics of the archetype today—after all, I really\
  \ DO want you to <a href=\"/products/btpy9oco\">buy the issue</a>—but a general\
  \ overview is in order. Here's my commentary on each of the archetype's class features.</p>\
  \ \n     <blockquote> \n      <p><b>Class Skills</b>: I knew I'd be trading the\
  \ ranger's spells class feature, so it made sense to swap out Spellcraft for Acrobatics.\
  \ Red Sonja doesn't know much about magic, but she certainly can leap around like\
  \ a monkey.</p> \n      <p><b>Death Vow</b>: This power is meant to model Sonja's\
  \ \"Curse of Hyrkania,\" which features prominently in her origin and in the Gail\
  \ Simone-written 18-issue run that redefined the character for modern audiences\
  \ in 2013. I've used that highly enjoyable run as a benchmark for Sonja's characterization\
  \ in the Worldscape series, and this is no exception. In the comic, Sonja puts the\
  \ Curse on an enemy to put them on notice that she will definitely be killing them\
  \ later, but probably not MUCH later. The mechanics here are an attempt to model\
  \ that on the game table. Had I more space, I might have included a few other original\
  \ death vows, but these Worldscape appendices are pretty tight on space, and I needed\
  \ to focus on the meat of the matter.</p> \n      <p><b>Slashing Fury</b>: The Sonja\
  \ stores heavily emphasize her Dexterity and quickness over her Strength, with a\
  \ prominent recent Conan/Red Sonja crossover written by Simone and former Pathfinder\
  \ comics scribe Jim Zub specifically mentioning that Conan is much stronger than\
  \ Red Sonja, but that she's no less a combatant for it, balancing things out with\
  \ speed and style. I ultimately settled on a 14 Strength for Sonja. That's decent,\
  \ but not enough to keep her competitive with most martial characters, who probably\
  \ put their highest score in Strength. I thus needed to come up with a way for Red\
  \ Sonja to add her Dex bonus to melee weapon attacks, something that involved significant\
  \ negotiation and development with Jason Bulmahn and Owen K. C. Stephens, who were\
  \ both extremely helpful to me during the process of building Sonja's stats and\
  \ this archetype. They drew the line at also allowing this power to add a Dex modifier\
  \ to damage. I tried, folks! With the damage adds from her death vow, I don't think\
  \ she's much poorer without the bonus, especially when fighting somebody she absolutely\
  \ wants to kill.</p> \n      <p><b>Inspiring Example</b>: If Red Sonja has any \"\
  powers\" above and beyond her combat prowess, it's in the inspiration she gives\
  \ those she meets along the way of her adventures. As a roaming nomad who has seen\
  \ two different publishers and hundreds of different writers over the last 40 years,\
  \ Sonja doesn't have a very large recurring back-up cast. That means her stories\
  \ typically involve her showing up in a community, encountering a problem, and solving\
  \ it before moving on to the next adventure (sound familiar, Pathfinders?). A VERY\
  \ common element of these stories, however, involves Sonja meeting some poor victim\
  \ of the problem at the beginning of the story and later having that victim gain\
  \ confidence and help her to solve the problem that once seemed unsolvable. Sort\
  \ of like Doctor Who, Red Sonja doesn't stay anywhere very long, and doesn't keep\
  \ companions for very long, but she does manage to leave both people and places\
  \ significantly better off than they were when she first arrived. As long as they're\
  \ not evil, of course!</p> \n      <p><b>Untouchable</b>: This is my armor kludge,\
  \ and with Sonja's 18 Charisma and a passel of dodge bonuses spaced out over various\
  \ levels, she remains competitive in the AC department, so long as she's got good\
  \ <i>bracers of armor</i> on. If she were MY character, rather than an adaptation,\
  \ I'd probably pop for a <i>dusty rose ioun stone</i> and an <i>amulet of natural\
  \ armor</i>, too.</p> \n      <p><b>Second Combat Style</b>: This one speaks for\
  \ itself. For Sonja's stats, I focused on the two ranger combat styles from the\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy88yj\"><em>Core Rulebook</em></a>, but we've added a lot\
  \ more in various books that could serve to make YOUR sword-devil even more distinctive.</p>\
  \ \n      <p><b>Seething Fury</b>: I always feel a little goofy designing class\
  \ features for 19th and 20th levels. Do people ever really make it that high? This\
  \ power and the next were inspired by Dynamite's semi-recent \"Vulture's Circle\"\
  \ and \"The Black Tower\" miniseries, which depict a much older—and much more prone\
  \ to crazy, supernatural violence—version of the character.</p> \n      <p><b>Avatar\
  \ of Vengeance</b>: This is right out of those stories, in which Red Sonja becomes\
  \ a living avatar of death. I made effectively no effort to balance this capstone\
  \ ability whatsoever. If you've survived 20 levels wearing no armor, you deserve\
  \ a gonzo reward.</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>And that's it for the sword-devil!\
  \ I next go to work on the warlord archetype for John Carter and Tars Tarkas. I\
  \ thought I could fit that into issue #2, but details on playing green Martian characters\
  \ and Martian radium weapons took up all my space for that issue, so the warlord\
  \ will appear somewhat further down the road.</p> \n     <p>But I'll be talking\
  \ more about that stuff in future installments of the Worldscape Workbook!</p> \n\
