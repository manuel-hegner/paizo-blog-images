  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Wednesday, December 16th, 2009</p> \n   <p>When Erik first\
  \ presented me with the manuscript for <a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy85jz\"\
  ><i>Who Fears the Devil?</i></a> by Manly Wade Wellman, my first thought was likely\
  \ the same as yours: </p> \n   <p><i>Who the heck names their son \"Manly\"?</i></p>\
  \ \n   <p>Yet Mr. Wellman is from a different time and a different place, and it's\
  \ precisely this distance which sets him most apart. For you see, unlike many of\
  \ the classic pulp stories we've published in <a href=\"/planetStories\">Planet\
  \ Stories</a>, <a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy85jz\"><i>Who Fears the Devil?</i></a>\
  \ isn't just a fun adventure, some purely whimsical construction of an author paid\
  \ to imagine things. It's a piece of Americana, a historical artifact steeped in\
  \ the legends and lore of Appalachia, and its stories carry the weight of truth.\
  \ This is Neil Gaiman's <i>American Gods</i> mashed up with Johnny Cash, and by\
  \ the end you feel like you've absorbed a college class's-worth of American folklore.\
  \ And where some older stories feel anachronistic today, Wellman's still has life.\
  \ For even today, strange things might lurk back in the misty hills where the roads\
  \ don't go, where folk live simple in sod-roofed houses, picking banjos and tilling\
  \ tiny hidden valleys, praying to the good lord to protect them from witch men and\
  \ the creatures scratching at their windows.... </p> \n   <p>I know I've said it\
  \ before (and I'll likely say it again), this is hands-down my favorite Planet Stories\
  \ book. Not only is the material fascinating—an entire folkloric tradition that\
  \ I've somehow remained woefully ignorant of until now—but Manly Wade Wellman is\
  \ a true master of the short story. Through the no-holds-barred patois of Silver\
  \ John, the two-fisted hobo saint who travels endlessly in search of rare songs\
  \ and legends, we are instantly and completely plunged into another world that rings\
  \ with authenticity and a strange sort of comfort, as if these were ghost stories\
  \ told by a kindly grandfather. This is fantasy of a breed you've likely never seen\
  \ before, and if that sounds like hyperbole, perhaps the fact that Mr. Wellman was\
  \ nominated for a Pulitzer Prize and famously beat out William Faulkner for the\
  \ Ellery Queen Mystery Magazine Award (a slight for which Faulkner, one of the most\
  \ important American authors of all time, reportedly never forgave him) will convince\
  \ you to give him a shot. </p> \n   <p><a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy85jz\"\
  ><i>Who Fears the Devil?</i></a> has all the weirdness of an RPG sourcebook and\
  \ all the comfort of your grandmother's quilt. Curl up with it. You won't be disappointed.</p>\
