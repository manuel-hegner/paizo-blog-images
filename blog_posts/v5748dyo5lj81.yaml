  ><em>Pathfinder Worldscape #1</em></a>, my new sword &amp; sorcery supergroup crossover\
  \ comic from Dynamite, is on newsstands and is shipping to paizo.com customers NOW!\
  \ Early reviews are pouring in for the issue, and I've been thrilled by the initial\
  \ response. Most readers seem to be digging the \"fish out of water\" story I've\
  \ been building as our intrepid iconic heroes meet the likes of Red Sonja, John\
  \ Carter of Mars, and Tarzan, and as the first issue shows, those meetings aren't\
  \ always going to go down the way you might expect them to.</p> \n    <p>Each issue\
  \ of <a href=\"/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics/worldscape\"\
  >Pathfinder Worldscape</a> contains a short RPG appendix that translates some of\
  \ Dynamite's heroes, races, equipment, and worlds to the official Pathfinder rules,\
  \ and while writing comic stories featuring all of these amazing characters has\
  \ been a wonderful and challenging experience, writing up their game statistics\
  \ has, to me, often seemed even more wonderful—and definitely more challenging.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The biggest challenge, truth be told, is in fitting everything I want\
  \ to say into the relatively short appendices. When you're suddenly unleashed on\
  \ the world of Barsoom, for example, there's an awful lot to say, and not a ton\
  \ of space to say it. For example, <a href=\"/products/btpy9oza\"><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Worldscape #2</em></a>, which releases three short weeks from now, was initially\
  \ to include stats for the green Martians of Barsoom, stats for the most famous\
  \ green Martian of all—John Carter's best friend Tars Tarkas—and stats for a new\
  \ \"warlord\" archetype that will be used by both Carter and Tars as a way to model\
  \ the \"no-armor\" fighting styles of Edgar Rice Burroughs's Mars books. All that\
  \ plus a poster map and some ideas for how to use it in a Pathfinder game.</p> \n\
  \    <p>As it turns out, I only ended up having room for the green Martian rules\
  \ in #2, plus some rules for radium rifles and pistols. Full stats for Tars Tarkas,\
  \ as well as the warlord archetype necessary to stat him (and John Carter) up, will\
  \ come in future issues.</p> \n    <p>But my space-bursting woes did not start with\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9oza\">issue #2</a>. I ran into similar trouble with <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy9oco\"><em>Pathfinder Worldscape #1</em></a>, and I thought\
  \ it might be fun to use this week's Worldscape Workbook to take a peek at some\
  \ Pathfinder rules that might have been.</p> \n    <p>I've already spent a lot of\
  \ space in this column ballyhooing writer Gail Simone's 2013 \"relaunch\" of Red\
  \ Sonja for a Dynamite arc entitiled \"Queen of Plagues.\" I relied on Simone's\
  \ characterization of Sonja for my take on the character in <a href=\"/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics/worldscape\"\
  >Pathfinder Worldscape</a>, and I probably read the six-issue arc a half-dozen times\
  \ during my preparation for the series.</p> \n    <p>Beside the great take on Red\
  \ Sonja, which really does a lot to restore agency to the character's origin and\
  \ remove some of the elements that might have made sense in the early 1970s but\
  \ which seem regressive by today's standards, one of my favorite elements of the\
  \ Queen of Plagues storyline were the weird fish-people used by Red Sonja nemesis.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Generally speaking, Red Sonja's world is more \"mundane\" than that of\
  \ the Pathfinder world. Based as it is on Robert E. Howard's Hyborian Age, the home\
  \ of Conan the Barbarian, Sonja's setting is one of ancient human kingdoms, the\
  \ occasional giant here and there, and maybe a serpent man lurking in the shadows.\
  \ It's not—again generally speaking, because different writers and artists bring\
  \ different approaches to each story—the sort of place where you wander into a tavern\
  \ to find orcs rubbing shoulders with halflings, dwarves, and elves. When a genuine\
  \ \"monster\" appears, it's generally a sign that something very unique and special\
  \ is happening.</p> \n    <p>The fish-men of that first Dynamite reboot arc are—\
  aside from some psychic ghosts—pretty much the only monsters in the bunch, and they\
  \ stick out in a very good way. We see several images of the creatures, usually\
  \ in crowd or battle scenes, and what we see is intriguing. Simone's fish-men, drawn\
  \ by artist Walter Giovanni, echo the vast diversity of the oceans themselves. Some\
  \ have heads like hammerhead sharks. Others have beards of octopus tentacles, or\
  \ are encrusted with coral. Some loom large and powerful, others sqat and blubbery.\
  \ All of them look interesting, and they also look like nothing I've ever quite\
  \ seen in Pathfinder before.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\
  //static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderComics/20161026-Seaspawn.jpg\"><img\
  \ src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderComics/20161026-Seaspawn_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <div class=\"blurb180\">\n     <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderComics/20161026-Seaspawn2.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderComics/20161026-Seaspawn2_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>So I wanted to include them from the very start. The\
  \ red sea-creature Kelgeth, from the opening scene of <a href=\"/products/btpy9oco\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Worldscape #1</em></a> in which Valeros finds himself on the Worldscape,\
  \ belongs to this race. I included him in this early scene in part to show the diversity\
  \ of the Worldscape as a unique representative of Sonja's Hyborian Age, but also\
  \ because I thought his appearance would be a good anchor for a cool new Pathfinder\
  \ race in the back of the issue.</p> \n    <p>That presented an interesting challenge\
  \ that speaks to the difference between writing a comic and writing a gaming supplement.\
  \ Although Gail Simone put a ton of cool characterization into snippets of dialog,\
  \ and Giovanni's art made the creatures unique and interesting, none of Simone's\
  \ scripts actually gives a formal name for the creatures. They're called \"fish-men\"\
  \ a few times, but it's unclear if that's supposed to be the name of the race or\
  \ if it's just something people call them dismissively. From a Pathfinder perspective,\
  \ we generally like to avoid gendered pronouns in race names (we use \"lizardfolk,\"\
  \ not \"lizard-men\"), so even if that was supposed to be their name, it didn't\
  \ really work for me. I started calling them \"sea-spawn,\" and the name stuck in\
  \ my head.</p> \n    <p>I imagined a <a href=\"/products/btpy9oco\"><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Worldscape #1</em></a> appendix filled with options for your sea-spawn character.\
  \ Want a big strong guy? You can! Want someone with a tentacle grab attack? Ok!\
  \ Just choose from this list of options and build your very own unique sea creature,\
  \ perfect for any campaign.</p> \n    <p>It never lasted more than a couple of days.\
  \ Once I began laying down Red Sonja's sword-devil archetype and her stat block\
  \ itself, it quickly became clear that I wouldn't have space to stat up the full\
  \ sea-spawn race. Maybe I'll find time in a future issue, or maybe in some other\
  \ future Worldscape project.</p> \n    <p>Until then, keep your eyes on the sea.\
  \ You never know what might come out!</p> \n    <p>If you have not already done\
  \ so, please consider picking up a copy of <em>Pathfinder Worldscape #1</em> at\
  \ your local comic shop or <a href=\"/products/btpy9oco\">right here on Paizo.com</a>!\
  \ Or, to make sure you never miss a single Pathfinder comic you can set up a <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy8tvw\">Pathfinder Comics ongoing subscription</a>!</p> \n\
  \    <p>I'll be back next week for another Worldscape Workbook, where I'll talk\
  \ about the game goodies to come in <a href=\"/products/btpy9oza\"><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Worldscape #2</em></a>! Until then, please let me know what you thought of the\
  \ first issue of the comic, and if there's anything from the Worldscape you'd like\
  \ me to make sure to make room for before I run out of RPG appendix pages!</p> \n\
  \    <p>Until then, I remain...</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p>\
