  \ must on Pulonis.</p> \n     <p>The first thing a kit learns after taking their\
  \ first steps is to make sure to stretch and limber up before running and climbing.\
  \ Pahtra households often start their mornings with family stretches before breakfast.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Kyyduh may have taken this tenet too far. Sometimes. Most of the time.\
  \ When they’re not taking advantage of just how flexible their body can be. When\
  \ they’re not embracing the plant life that is as much a part of them as their heart\
  \ and their eyes.</p> \n     <p>They grew up surrounded by machines. Surrounded\
  \ by military, by guns, by ships, by technology, all of it fueling a clash that\
  \ Kyyduh hadn’t so much been born into as they’d inherited. Starlance was a good\
  \ place for a pahtra family to live, and with no obvious rebel connections, Kyyduh\
  \ and their siblings were fast-tracked into the Veskarium’s military academy. Their\
  \ siblings took the trainings and positions offered to them, succeeding and achieving\
  \ and making names for themselves. Kyyduh found that their mind couldn’t seem to\
  \ keep up with the words being yelled at them, the words being scribbled and erased\
  \ too quickly on the chalkboards, the words appearing in the too-thick books they\
  \ were expected to read too fast. They could run and climb and lift, but they couldn’\
  t focus long enough on their commanding officer to learn when to run and climb and\
  \ lift. </p> \n     <p>Kyyduh left the academy at the end of their twentieth summer.\
  \ With what little money they had left from their parents, they booked passage on\
  \ a ship for as far as their credits would take them, and wound up on the outskirts\
  \ of the Holy Lands. They did a lot of manual labor there, listening to other, smarter\
  \ pahtras and vesk discussing things like the biology of the plants growing, the\
  \ geologic implications of magnetism on flora, the effects of radiation on fauna.\
  \ The scientists were genuinely nice, even the vesk ones (maybe <em>especially</em>\
  \ the vesk ones), and they explained what they were talking about to Kyyduh in a\
  \ way they could understand. </p> \n     <br> \n     <br clear=\"all\"> \n     <table\

  \    </table> \n     <br> \n     <p>The camp was studying the restoration of the\
  \ Holy Lands. It was funded by the Veskarium—but what isn’t, on Pulonis? Only about\
  \ half their discoveries made it to Command 6, while the rest seemed to go to Hafrerren\
  \ or just to random places around the Shriek. Kyyduh learned about plants, animals,\
  \ rocks, and most importantly, they learned about Pulonis and other planets. They\
  \ learned about storms and the Shriek, and they fell in love with the sound of winds\
  \ screaming and rain pounding. </p> \n     <p>So when the camp needed someone to\
  \ fly out in a terrible storm to retrieve some valuable equipment, Kyyduh was already\
  \ on the ravine crawler, ready to go. One of the scientists, an older pahtra woman\
  \ named Nayawsa who often fussed over them and made sure they remembered to eat,\
  \ gave them a concerned look before placing a charm of Meyel around their neck and\
  \ telling them to be safe. Kyyduh gave their famous confident grin and tore off\
  \ into the rain. </p> \n     <p>The ride was longer than they expected. Despite\
  \ their weatherproof gear, the rain got in between the layers and made everything\
  \ cling to them. There weren’t any animals out in such a wild storm, but there were\
  \ plenty of trees that couldn’t be seen until they were nearly nose-to-nose with\
  \ them. Kyyduh found it easy to focus when they required all their attention to\
  \ keep the craft balanced and not slam into something. They located the equipment,\
  \ loaded it up, and headed back. The scientists burst into applause when they came\
  \ crashing through the surrounding brush. Everyone celebrated later that evening\
  \ and Kyyduh was surrounded by warmth, good drinks, and friends. </p> \n     <p>This\
  \ became their new norm. During storms they collected equipment, checked on animal\
  \ spots, gathered samples, and made sure that everything in the camp kept running.\
  \ They found it easy to stay focused, and their mind finally stopped moving a million\
  \ miles an hour long enough for them to make sense of things when they were riding\
  \ through the forests in the rain. Kyyduh developed a knack for being able to tell\
  \ how bad a storm was going to be as it was forming, picking up on cloud movement\
  \ and wind speed. They could sense the humidity in the air before the instruments\
  \ started going off, and they were included in morning meetings about setup and\
  \ missions. </p> \n     <p>Things changed when Kyyduh took a trip through a bad\
  \ lightning storm to the edge of the Shriek. Their attention flitted away when they\
  \ sensed a hymothoa nearby and they jerked the controls, slamming into a huge tree\
  \ they’d passed a thousand times. The world went dark. They awoke a few times to\
  \ the feeling of plants surrounding them, of vines along their fur, of their friends\
  \ examining them with concerned looks. </p> \n     <p>When they finally came to,\
  \ Kyyduh was <em>different.</em> They could feel it. They opened more eyes than\
  \ they remembered; they looked in the mirror and saw a clash of plant-like features\
  \ across their body. Their leg was different now, but that was the least startling\
  \ change. A motion of their hand and their whole arm shifted into a giant claw and\
  \ then back again. They spent time with their friends learning about their forms,\
  \ finding that they could adapt their new changes by interacting with new plants,\
  \ changing their body and their new biotech augmentations on a whim to better fit\
  \ all kinds of scenarios. </p> \n     <p>Flexibility. Adaptability. Change. Evolution.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>They found that they could change their friends, too, and when\
  \ the military showed up to shut down the illegal camp, well, Kyyduh used their\
  \ abilities to help everyone get away before taking off into the forest to escape\
  \ off-world. They kept the charm of Meyel, though, as a reminder of a time before\
  \ the Veskarium colonized their world. Nayawsa insisted. </p> \n     <p>Kyyduh found\
  \ new friends and companions. Today, they maintain their laidback attitude, their\
  \ tendency to joke when things get tense. They still struggle to focus in situations\
  \ where they’re not fully entranced by the subject, and their impulsivity is made\
  \ worse when they evolve too much, too quickly. Their lack of a filter can cause\
  \ them to tumble headfirst into tough situations, but their genuine good nature\
  \ and willingness to protect others save them just as often as the thick, bark-like\
  \ armor that appears on their body when they’re threatened. At day’s end, they know\
  \ they’re surrounded by friends and they know they have a home world that will always\
  \ be a part of them, body and soul. </p> \n     <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight:\
