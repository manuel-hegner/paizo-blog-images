  \ Illustration by Dave Rapoza\n   </div> \n   <p>I almost lined this holiday boon\
  \ up perfectly with its in-game date and real-world date. When I realized it was\
  \ my 6-month anniversary (wow, time flies), I was torn. What better way to celebrate\
  \ than to help Pathfinders fight undead? But I felt my state of PFS blog was slightly\
  \ more important, so I delayed this holiday blog for a week.</p> \n   <p>Managing\
  \ Editor F. Wesley Schneider wrote the description below of Conquest Day, and where\
  \ you’ll also find a special Pathfinder Society Chronicle sheet you can download\
  \ and apply to a Pathfinder Society character. Conquest Day is mentioned on page\
  \ 248 of <a href=\"/products/btpy8ief\"><i>The Inner Sea World Guide</i></a>.</p>\
  \ \n   <blockquote> \n    <p>Every year, on the 26th of Pharast, Elder Architect\
  \ Oblosk—oldest member of Nex’s Council of Three and Nine—ascends to the highest\
  \ balconies of the Bandeshar in Quantium. In a voice made thunderous by the platform’\
  s magic, the wizened pech councilman spends the hours from dusk to just past noon\
  \ enumerating the atrocities committed by the necromancers of Geb upon the people\
  \ of Nex, culminating with the disappearance of the archwizard Nex himself. At the\
  \ conclusion of this record of national wounds, the country’s eleven other council\
  \ members join Oblosk in renewing their yearly vow to neither forget nor forgive\
  \ the Gebbites’ atrocities and to again swear in their lost ruler’s name to endlessly\
  \ wage war against their ancient enemies. </p> \n    <p>On this day, known as Conquest\
  \ Day, all the people of Nex are expected to share in their leaders’ oaths, to celebrate\
  \ the shared patriotism of their wondrous nation, and to remember the sacrifices\
  \ of heroes past. This also makes it a day for many Nexian wizards to reveal deadly\
  \ new spells, gigantic constructs, and audacious arcane masterworks—which many creators\
  \ promise to be the doom of their foes. Even throughout the rest of the Inner Sea\
  \ region, many crusaders, rebels, and zealots observe Conquest Day as a day to renew\
  \ blood oaths, launch long-planned battles, and finally take revenge. It is a day\
  \ for words of honor, a day for battle cries, and a day where glory most favors\
  \ the bold.</p> \n   </blockquote> \n   <p>A bit dreary with all the talk of battles\
  \ and undead and disappearing archwizards and the like, but hey, at least it is\
  \ better than Taxfest (and yes, that’s also on page 248).</p> \n   <p>Mike Brock<br>\
  \ <i>Pathfinder Society Campaign Coordinator</i></p> \n  </blockquote> <!-- tags:\
