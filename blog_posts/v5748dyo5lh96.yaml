  \ blog, let me tell you the best thing that happened to me at a fantastic <a href=\"\
  http://east.paxsite.com\" target=\"_blank\">PAX East</a>. Through designer Chad\
  \ Brown, Pathfinder Adventure Card Game fan Jim Wnorowski contacted me at the con\
  \ about helping with his wedding proposal to his girlfriend, Sarah. As I came out\
  \ of my <a href=\"http://cardsagainsthumanity.com/deathmatch/\" target=\"_blank\"\
  >Tabletop Deathmatch</a> panel, Jim flagged me down. He \"introduced himself,\"\
  \ and then introduced me to Sarah, a self-proclaimed fan of my games. Jim then asked\
  \ me if I had any promo cards.</p> \n    <p>\"Oh, yeah,\" I said, \"I wasn't going\
  \ to give those out till my <a href=\"http://youtu.be/wnzBhWwx1nI\" target=\"_blank\"\
  >100 Games You Absolutely Must Know How to Play panel on Sunday</a>, but I think\
  \ I've got one in my bag.\" And then I proceeded to fish around in my shoulder bag\
  \ for at least a minute, unzipping every pocket and shuffling around every piece\
  \ of paper, while Jim sweated out the delay.</p> \n    <p>\"Oh, here's one!\" I\
  \ said after the agonizing wait, and gave them a card that Jim had created. This\
  \ one was something special. He got down on one knee as she looked it over.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20150310-Proposal1.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Jim gives Sarah a card, then begins his move step.<br>Photos\
  \ by Eric Neustadter.</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>I would be lying if I said Sarah\
  \ said yes immediately. In fact, her brain locked up, discombobulated from all that\
  \ was going on. But after a paralyzing few seconds, her mind re-engaged and she\
  \ leapt into Jim's arms and said yes. And that is the best thing that happened to\
  \ me at PAX East.</p> \n    <p>I bring up this story both because it's awesome and\
  \ because Jim created his card on the <a href=\"http://www.drivethrucards.com/builder/pathfinder\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Pathfinder Adventure Card Game Community Card Creator</a>, a\
  \ spiffy new tool from DriveThruCards that allows you to make your own cards for\
  \ the game. I've seen lots of fans experimenting with it, so I thought I'd revisit\
  \ some guidelines I use for making cards of similar power level and compatibility\
  \ to the ones in the game. Note that not all the features of the card creator are\
  \ live yet, so some of this won't work on the site today. But eventually, it all\
  \ will, and you'll have this as a resource. I hope you find this useful as you make\
  \ cards that work with ours!</p> \n    <h2>Brainstorming</h2> \n    <p>Start with\
  \ a concept, such as \"an underwater fortress,\" \"a divine alchemist,\" or \"a\
  \ vampire monk.\" You can come up with something on your own, or take some inspiration\
  \ from Paizo books, real-world concepts, or other universes. Just make sure it's\
  \ something where you can say \"I thought of something new, and here it is.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Then, for most types of cards, think of what adventure deck number that\
  \ concept matches. If you imagine your concept as something only really powerful\
  \ characters can deal with, then maybe a 5 or 6 is appropriate. If it's something\
  \ that anyone can handle, use B or 1. This decision will affect several aspects\
  \ of your cards.</p> \n    <p>Depending on what type of card you're creating, some\
  \ additional guidelines might be useful.</p> \n    <h2>Banes</h2> \n    <p>Monsters\
  \ and barriers should scale in difficulty against the ones in the box. For noncombat\
  \ checks, a good baseline difficulty is 6 to 10 plus twice the adventure deck number.\
  \ However, if you're aiming solely for a skill that isn't one of the big six (Strength,\
  \ Dexterity, etc.), keep in mind that most characters will be rolling a d4. So keep\
  \ the numbers low in that case, unless you really want only those who have the skill\
  \ to succeed.</p> \n    <p>For combat checks, consider a difficulty of around 8\
  \ to 10 plus 2.5 or 3 times the adventure deck number. You can start adding monsters\
  \ and barriers with multiple checks after adventure 3 or so. The powers should be\
  \ reasonably simple through adventure 3, and then start getting more bizarre. If\
  \ the powers usually reduce the character's ability to fight, such as by dealing\
  \ damage before you act or by requiring multiple checks, you might want to reduce\
  \ the difficulty by 2 to 5.</p> \n    <p>Henchmen should be tougher than the average\
  \ monster you can imagine in your scenario, so increase the difficulties from the\
  \ previous paragraph by an amount roughly equal to the adventure deck number. If\
  \ you expect to want to use the henchman in multiple adventures, consider giving\
  \ it the Veteran trait and a power that uses the adventure deck number. The henchman\
  \ should always say it gives a chance to close the location, unless it doesn't.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Villains can have difficulties of as much as 10 higher than your average\
  \ bane. They should always have something special about encountering them. When\
  \ a villain shows up, everyone at the table should be invested in the outcome. Villain\
  \ powers that scale with the number of characters present, the number of locations,\
  \ or the number of open locations help reinforce this.</p> \n    <h2>Boons</h2>\
  \ \n    <p>Boons should have checks to acquire in the neighborhood of 4 to 8 plus\
  \ twice the adventure deck number. Watch out for boons that can only be acquired\
  \ by skills that not all characters have. If a boon has a recharge check, aim for\
  \ a difficulty 2 higher than the check to acquire.</p> \n    <p>Loot should be pretty\
  \ darn awesome.</p> \n    <h2>Characters, Roles, and Tokens</h2> \n    <p>Characters\
  \ should be tightly balanced against the ones in the box. Each character should\
  \ start with 15 cards on her Card List. Add up the dice in your character's skills;\
  \ if it's more than 42, you're probably aiming too high. The character should have\
  \ no more than 1d12 in any skill. She should have 15 skill feat checkboxes, 10 card\
  \ feat checkboxes, and 4 power feat checkboxes on her character card; no skill or\
  \ card type should have more than 4 checkboxes.</p> \n    <p>Roles should have 12\
  \ power feat checkboxes each, including the 4 from the powers on the characters\
  \ they advance. Save your craziest powers for the roles.</p> \n    <p>Tokens should\
  \ tell intriguing backstories that make you want to play the characters again and\
  \ again.</p> \n    <h2>Story Cards</h2> \n    <p>Adventure Paths list a set of at\
  \ least 3 adventures. They should specify what happens to cards in the box as the\
  \ adventure progresses. You can add adventure path powers that typically refer to\
  \ things that happen between games.</p> \n    <p>Adventures need a set of scenarios,\
  \ usually 3 or more. We recommend that you specify an play order, or it can be hard\
  \ to keep track of which ones have been completed. Pick a reward that is on the\
  \ level of \"a card feat\" or \"a skill feat.\" As with adventure paths, if adventures\
  \ have powers, they should not be of the kind that you must remember to consult\
  \ frequently, because players will forget about them.</p> \n    <p>Scenarios generally\
  \ need at least one villain and some henchmen that are appropriate for the power\
  \ level of your characters. Powers can be simple or complex; think of something\
  \ that sets your scenario apart from others and implement it. Your location list\
  \ should have eight locations, unless you're doing something wacky. A standard scenario\
  \ will have two more locations than you have players. Be careful when setting rewards;\
  \ you don't want to give out too much for success. Make sure to put any lasting\
  \ benefits in the Rewards section. You want people to be able to replay your scenario\
  \ multiple times without skewing the rest of the campaign.</p> \n    <h2>Locations\
  \ and Support Cards</h2> \n    <p>Locations should have fairly simple powers in\
  \ each section. Watch the difficulty on noncombat checks to close locations, as\
  \ these do not scale well. If you want a power that continues after closing, put\
  \ it on the back as well.</p> \n    <p>Ships should have noncombat checks to defeat\
  \ in the 6 to 12 range, and similar Craft checks to repair. Most have powers that\
  \ make them harder to fight in the Encountering section, and they'll usually have\
  \ a power in the Commanding section that allows you to discard cards from the blessings\
  \ deck to trigger effects. You're looking for simple, frequently usable powers here,\
  \ as you'll refer to them a lot during play.</p> \n    <p>As these new types of\
  \ cards start to roll out for the <a href=\"http://www.drivethrucards.com/builder/pathfinder\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Card Creator</a>, experiment with them and see what you come\
  \ up with. And if you decide to make an Engagement Ring card, be aware that it might\
  \ take me just a little while to find it in my bag.</p> \n    <p>And again, congratulations,\
  \ Sarah and Jim!</p> \n    <p>Mike Selinker<br> <i>Adventure Card Game Designer</i></p>\
