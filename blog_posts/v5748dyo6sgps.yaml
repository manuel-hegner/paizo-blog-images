  \    </div> \n    <p>I knew it would come for me. My thrice-cursed fate would not\
  \ be denied: my blood, my birth, and my faith. I knew I would be chosen; my mother\

  >Twenty-four black hooves, four iron-rimmed wheels, and fourteen glowing red eyes,\
  \ the coach and six, the harbinger of my fate, my promise, my doom, glided down\
  \ the cobbled street toward me without a whisper. The good citizens of Cesca scattered,\
  \ scuttling into doorways, slamming shutters, scurrying into alleys like terrified\
  \ rats. I stood and awaited my fate.</p> \n    <p>The ebony coach stopped before\
  \ me, the driver's burning coal eyes transfixing me like needles pinning a moth\
  \ in a display. Armor rustled like winter-dead leaves hammered from cold iron as\
  \ one hand released the reins to delve the driver's cloak. A roll of ebony parchment\
  \ bound with a blood-red ribbon issued forth, held out in that undying grasp for\
  \ me.</p> \n    <p>\"Your invitation, daughter of Arudora.\" The voice chilled me\
  \ like the touch of an icy scalpel.</p> \n    <p>\"Of course.\" I took the invitation\
  \ in hand, pulled the ribbon, and unrolled the black parchment that sealed my doom.\
  \ I read, \"Marilisa Balcus Arudora,\" my name, the only words on the page.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The armored driver gestured, and the coach's door swung silently open.\
  \ \"Welcome.\"</p> \n    <p>The midnight coach swallowed me.</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  ></a> \n     <p>Illustration by Mariusz Gandzel</p>\n    </div> \n    <p>Black leather,\
  \ satin drapes, and pale faces rimed with terror greeted me. I sat and adjusted\
  \ my skirts. The seat was cold, and the faces colder, six of my kin doomed to the\
  \ fate we all shared. I only recognized one, a cousin I'd met only once. His eyes\
  \ took me in with subdued recognition, one hand gripping the head of his walking\
  \ stick, a silver wolf, teeth bared in rage. The others, two peasants, a tradesman,\
  \ a merchant, and a trollop, avoided my gaze, resigned to our common fate. A prospect\
  \ worse than death lurked in their eyes.</p> \n    <p>The coach moved, but I'd not\
  \ felt it and heard not a sound but the beating of my own heart and tremulous breath.\
  \ The merchant rocked forward and back, his hands clutched white-knuckled. The trollop\
  \ withdrew a silver flask from her ample bodice and drew a draught. She caught my\
  \ eye and flashed a smile.</p> \n    <p>\"Drop o' liquid courage, love?\" She held\
  \ out the flask, the scent of brandy heady in the air.</p> \n    <p>\"No, thank\
  \ you.\" I'd long ago consigned my courage to the flames.</p> \n    <p>\"Suit yourself.\"\
  \ She drank again and tucked the flask away.</p> \n    <p>\"Can't do this...can't\
  \ do this...\" the fidgety merchant muttered.</p> \n    <p>\"Oh, do shut up, man!\"\
  \ My gentleman cousin eyed him derisively.</p> \n    <p>\"Bugger off and leave him\
  \ be!\" one of the peasants snapped, a lip curling back from tobacco-stained teeth.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"How dare you speak toâ€”\"</p> \n    <p>\"Can't do this!\" The hysterical\
  \ merchant drew a stiletto.</p> \n    <p>\"Don't!\" The word escaped my lips before\
  \ I could bite it off, but it did no good.</p> \n    <p>The merchant's trembling\
  \ hand drew a ragged line of crimson across his throat. He cut deep, deep enough\
  \ to paint the trollop seated across from him with the spray. She swore, fending\
  \ off his lifeblood with a raised arm. The merchant choked and coughed, shuddering\
  \ as the torrent slowed.</p> \n    <p>\"Bloody fool,\" my gentleman cousin scoffed.\
  \ \"Death is no escape now.\"</p> \n    <p>True enough, for as the merchant's blood\
  \ ceased to flow with the last fluttering beats of his dying heart, only surprise\
  \ registered on his paling features. His eyes blinked, bloody lips gaping in shock\
  \ as undeath took him. We could not escape our fate so easily.</p> \n    <p>The\
  \ trollop withdrew her flask and drained its contents in one greedy draught, her\
  \ cheeks pale under the cheap rouge and flecks of blood.</p> \n    <p>\"Hells and\
  \ demons,\" the surly peasant swore, making a sign to ward off evil.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  That won't save you either, ignorant fool.\" My gentleman cousin's nose wrinkled,\
  \ perhaps at the stench of blood, perhaps in sheer disdain.</p> \n    <p>\"Neither\
  \ will that blade in your cane, sir, enchanted though it be.\" I don't know why\
  \ I spoke, but I felt the need to put the pompous ass in his place. \"No mortal-forged\
  \ implement will save you.\"</p> \n    <p>His eyes narrowed at me. \"You seem quite\
  \ sure of yourself, Marilisa.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I am.\" I adjusted my skirts again,\
  \ my hand exploring the folds for my one hope of salvation. Cold metal caressed\
  \ my palm. \"I've known my fate my entire life, Lord Wolthaven. As have you.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Oh, and I suppose you've some trick you hope will save you!\" He glared\
  \ at me, dredging courage from anger.</p> \n    <p>\"No trick.\" I gripped my only\
  \ hope and prayed silently.</p> \n    <p>\"Look!\" The tradesman pointed out the\
  \ window at the passing scenery.</p> \n    <p>Ruined buildings, dilapidated cottages,\
  \ and crumbled towers took on a ghostly radiance, blazing blue with shadows of their\
  \ former grandeur as we passed through the dead village of Maiserene. I recognized\
  \ it from my studies. I wondered if anyone outside the carriage could see the apparition\
  \ or if it existed only for our doomed eyes. Ahead the spectral bridge to our destination\
  \ coalesced over the dark water of Lake Laroba. Our conveyance paused not as we\
  \ crossed, silent water roiling beneath us, perhaps hungering for the living or\
  \ welcoming us to our fate.</p> \n    <p>We plunged through the toothed maw of Bastardhall's\
  \ gate, the wail of cold iron hinges, gears, and chains a cacophonous greeting.\
  \ One of the peasants began sobbing. The coach pulled into a vast courtyard and\
  \ stopped before the grim foyer.</p> \n    <p>Three tall figures awaited our arrival:\
  \ a woman of pale complexion with white-streaked hair, another woman bearing the\
  \ sigil of Urgathoa upon her breast, and a hooded shape holding a swaddled bundle\
  \ in his arms.</p> \n    <p>I knew they had long prepared for this meeting.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The carriage door opened and my destiny propelled me forth, my legs steady,\
  \ teeth clenched against useless screams, and my hand gripping the spike of silver\
  \ that no mortal hand had forged. The fire of a burning sun scorched my palm as\
  \ I strode forth to my fate.</p> \n    <p>Chris A. Jackson<br> <i>Contributing Author</i></p>\
