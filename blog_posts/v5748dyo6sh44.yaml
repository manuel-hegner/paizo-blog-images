  \ been on the road, trying to find their place in a vast world they didn’t even\
  \ know existed for most of their lives.</p> \n     <p>The party, taken through this\
  \ world by GM and occult enthusiast Jacob Kile, consists of:</p> \n     <ul> \n\
  \      <li><b>Croog Claudel</b>, played by Croog: A human monk searching for his\
  \ long-lost siblings, hoping to make amends when he finds them.</li> \n      <li><b>Moss\
  \ the Magnificent</b>, played by Molly McIsaac: An Elven Sorcerer trying to recapture\
  \ the fame she had back home.</li> \n      <li><b>Robyn Way</b>, played by Jonas\
  \ Newhouse: A Gnome druid desperate to hide from her former life and family. She’\
  s married to Remi.</li> \n      <li><b>Remi Ashwillow</b>, played by William White:\
  \ The Goblin fighter and Robyn’s partner is just trying to make friends and live\
  \ life after being stuck in a cult for many years.</li> \n     </ul> \n     <p>Catch\
