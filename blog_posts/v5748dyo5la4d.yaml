  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, October 16, 2007</p> \n   <p>Welcome to Sothis,\
  \ capital of the great desert nation of Osirion, gateway to the mysteries of the\
  \ sands. Centuries ago, the legendary ancient pharaohs ruled over a nation of sorcerers\
  \ and slaves with an iron fist, wielding godlike magical abilities unlike anything\
  \ in the modern world. Now they are gone, and all that remains of their wonder and\
  \ terror lies buried beneath the dunes, concealed in vast stone pyramids and protected\
  \ by traps and curses that reflect the height of their terrifying ingenuity. But\
  \ the prospect of being eaten alive by beetles in the dark corridors of some lost\
  \ tomb doesn't seem to bother the myriad adventurers, guides, soldiers, mercenaries,\
  \ swindlers, thieves, and noblemen that have come from all over the world to get\
  \ a chance to plunder the lost treasure of the pharaohs.</p> \n   <p>Among those\
  \ who have recently arrived to stake their claim on these treasures is a group of\
  \ adventurers led by a Chelish noblemen named Paracount Julistar, who just happens\
  \ to be one of the most famous Osiriontologists in the world. Fanatical, yet suave,\
  \ Julistar is an archetype of his fellow countrymen, and has carefully assembled\
  \ a private team of profiteers from across the globe to race the PCs to the Find\
  \ of the Century.</p> \n   <p>Collectively, this group of specialists is known as\
  \ Her Majestrix's Expeditionary, and includes Xaven, a hardcore, wisecracking tomb\
  \ raider who has spent so much time outwitting the traps of the dead he's begun\
  \ to lose his grip on reality, Scepter, a brooding ex-Pathfinder sharpshooter who\
  \ sports a bandolier of custom-crafted magic wands and employs a specially built\
  \ wand-rifle, Hrokon, a half-orc shock trooper, and Lonicera, a drop-dead gorgeous\
  \ liar and master of the long con. Together, they are prepared to give the PCs as\
  \ much as they can handle and more as the two groups pursue the prize that awaits\
  \ them in <i><a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7x6l\">J1: Entombed with the Pharaohs</a></i>.</p>\
