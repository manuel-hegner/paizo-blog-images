  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Thursday, November 6, 2008</p> \n   <p><b>Warning</b>:\
  \ If you wish to avoid spoilers about future Pathfinder Society scenarios, do not\
  \ read this blog post.</p> \n   <p>Next week we begin our second open call for Pathfinder\
  \ Society scenarios. Our first open call went quite well and we were happy to announce\
  \ that Matthieu Dayon and Craig Campbell will write #17—<i>Perils of the Pirate\
  \ Pact</i> and #18—<i>The Trouble with Secrets</i> respectively. Every single entry\
  \ was given some kind of feedback and, hopefully, this sort of feedback helps our\
  \ submitters to craft entries that better fit the types of stories we're seeking.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Our first open call went well and I, personally, learned a lot. Because\
  \ of what I learned, I'm making a few changes to the submission guidelines to help\
  \ speed up the entire process. The new, revised, submission guidelines are as follows:</p>\
  \ \n   <blockquote> \n    <p>1. Based on a summary (or summaries) posted here on\
  \ the Paizo daily blog as well as on the Pathfinder Society <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/submissions\"\
  >Write For Us</a> page, write a 750-word outline that includes the following (<b>read\
  \ published scenarios</b> for samples of how these are done keeping your word count\
  \ in mind):</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>a. An introduction</p> \n     <p>b.\
  \ A summary of the complete story</p> \n     <p>c. Five unique or dynamic encounters\
  \ tied to the overall plot</p> \n     <p>d. A conclusion</p> \n     <p>e. Five short\
  \ suggestions for possible faction missions</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>2.\
  \ By the due date, email your outline to <a href=\"mailto:josh@paizo.com\">josh@paizo.com</a>\
  \ with the subject line <b>[SCENARIO NAME] [YOUR LAST NAME]</b>. Your summary must\
  \ be in a MS Word document, plain text, or Rich Text format—these are files ending\
  \ in <b>.doc</b>, <b>.txt</b>, or <b>.rtf</b>. Your file must be titled [SCENARIO\
  \ NAME]_[LAST NAME], i.e., PerilsofthePiratePact_Dayon. Failure to submit your entry\
  \ in one of the requested formats (i.e., just pasting it into your email) and failure\
  \ to properly name your file <i>may</i> disqualify your entry.</p> \n    <p>3. Include\
  \ your full legal name, email address, physical mailing address, and a contact phone\
  \ number at the top of your submission—this text does <i>not</i> count toward your\
  \ word count. Failure to include this information <i>will</i> disqualify your entry\
  \ <i>and</i> you won't receive feedback at the end of the process.</p> \n    <p>4.\
  \ Once all submissions are in, the Pathfinder Society coordinator will take two\
  \ weeks to review submissions and select an author for each open scenario. You will\
  \ receive an email confirming receipt—please allow 72 hours for a response before\
  \ resending your submission. The coordinator will attempt to respond to all submitters\
  \ with feedback, but this may not always be possible.</p> \n    <p>5. If you are\
  \ selected to write a scenario, you will be emailed instructions that include your\
  \ word count, due date, and contract.</p> \n    <p>6. Failing to follow any of the\
  \ instructions above will immediately disqualify you from the open call.</p> \n\
  \   </blockquote> \n   <p>The open call that starts next week is for Pathfinder\
  \ Society scenarios #19 and #20—the April releases. The full schedule for this submission\
  \ period is as follows:</p> \n   <blockquote> \n    <p>11/13—Open call begins with\
  \ summaries posted here on the Paizo daily blog and on the Pathfinder Society <a\
  \ href=\"http://paizo.com/pathfinderSociety/submissions\">Write For Us</a> page</p>\
  \ \n    <p>11/21—Submissions due by 11:59 P.M. Pacific Time</p> \n    <p>12/12—\
  Submissions review completed—selected authors notified</p> \n    <p>12/15—Decision\
  \ announced on messageboards and on the <a href=\"http://paizo.com/pathfinderSociety\"\
  >Pathfinder Society home page</a></p> \n   </blockquote> \n   <p>While we won't\
  \ begin accepting scenario outlines until next week, here are a few hints to get\
  \ your brain juices flowing:</p> \n   <blockquote> \n    <p>Scenario 19—Siege Keeps\
  \ &amp; Hidden Dungeons<br> Scenario 20—Cheliax Demon Hunt</p> \n   </blockquote>\
  \ \n   <p>Good luck!</p> \n   <p>Joshua J. Frost <br>Events Manager</p> \n  </blockquote>\
