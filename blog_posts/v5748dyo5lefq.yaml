  \ Sandpoint Revealed</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, February 12, 2013</p>\
  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">When\
  \ Erik Mona asked me if I'd be interested in writing additional content for the\
  \ <a href=\"/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics\">Pathfinder\
  \ comic</a>, I nearly giggled with joy—this would be an excellent place for me to\
  \ finally get some of the information about the Sandpoint hinterlands out there\
  \ that I've been building up over the years. I've managed to get some more Sandpoint\
  \ goodness into the Adventure Path line now and then, most significantly recently\
  \ with the first installment of <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/jadeRegent\"\
  >Jade Regent</a> and the two goblin-themed Free RPG Day adventures (make sure to\
  \ check out the upcoming <a href=\"/products/btpy8wvm\"><i>We Be Goblins Too!</i></a>\
  \ coming soon to a friendly local game store near you!), but I've always got more\
  \ to say about my favorite town on Golarion and the region surrounding it.</span></p>\
  \ \n    <p>One way I've been scratching that itch was to set my in-house campaign\
  \ in Sandpoint. For several years, I ran my \"Shadow Under Sandpoint\" game for\
  \ nine (whew!) fellow Paizonians, and during that campaign they began to learn about\
  \ the sinister machinations of the Red Bishop, the local ghoul population, secrets\
  \ hidden in certain Sandpoint mansions, the truth behind the serial killer known\
  \ as Chopper and the mysterious Sandpoint Devil, and more.</p> \n    <p>But now,\
  \ that group's split into two groups, and both of them have moved on to Osirion\
  \ to fight against the rising cult of the Scorpion God Rovagug, leaving Sandpoint\
  \ behind.</p> \n    <p>Which brings me back to the Pathfinder comic.</p> \n    <p>In\
  \ each issue of the comic, I've been able to present more information about the\
  \ hinterlands surrounding Sandpoint. Compared to the Inner Sea region, the Sandpoint\
  \ hinterlands are really quite small, but as I've proven to the rest of Paizo, they're\
  \ more than large enough to run an entire campaign from 1st to 11th level or so.\
  \ I drew upon several of the plot threads I developed for that campaign when I was\
  \ writing content for the comics, but also took the chance to get into print some\
  \ other ideas and concepts I'd been toying with in the back of my head about the\
  \ hinterlands over the past several years.</p> \n    <p>So! If you're looking for\
  \ more adventures for your characters to have in and near Sandpoint (perhaps as\
  \ supplementary encounters in your <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/riseOfTheRunelords\"\
  >Rise of the Runelords</a> campaign), or if you simply want to know more about one\
  \ of the first locations we ever developed for the Pathfinder campaign setting...\
  \ look no further than the Pathfinder comic! Below, I've built a handy table of\
  \ contents for the first six issues of the comic, and since not every issue is out\
  \ for sale yet, this doubles as a sneak preview!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb180\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"/products/btpy8tw2\"><img src=\"/image/product/catalog/DYN/DYN0001-E_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p><a href=\"/products/btpy8tw2\"><b>Pathfinder\
  \ Issue #1</b></a>: The first issue kicks off with a gazetteer of the town of Sandpoint—\
  if you don't have Rise of the Runelords, this is a great place to pick up information\
  \ about Sandpoint a new PC might want to know. For the GMs, there are three pages\
  \ of Adventure Hooks, including more information about the Sandpoint Devil, the\
  \ serial killer Chopper, and the ruins of the Old Light. Full stat blocks for Sheriff\
  \ Belor Hemlock and Father Abstalar Zantus, as well as for the stars of the comic—\
  Seoni, Valeros, Ezren, and Merisiel—round things out.</p> \n    <p>Oh! I almost\
  \ forgot! Each issue of the comic comes with a short encounter area supported by\
  \ a foldout 10\" x 16\" battle mat! In this issue, the encounter takes place on\
  \ Sandpoint's Junk Beach, where a band of goblins are up to no good...</p> \n  \
  \  <p><a href=\"/products/btpy8u1a\"><b>Pathfinder Issue #2</b></a>: In the second\
  \ issue, the attention turns away from Sandpoint into the Hinterlands, settling\
  \ fully on the small forest known as Shank's Wood. A two-page gazetteer of the region\
  \ begins the section, followed by an encounter in a creepy building the local goblins\
  \ have taken to calling the \"Shankshack,\" since one of their enemies, a man named\
  \ Shank, dared to move in. Of course, as visitors to the Shankshack quickly learn,\
  \ an enemy of goblins isn't necessarily a friend to you! Stats for the last two\
  \ stars of the comic, Kyra and Harsk, finish this installment off, and the battle\
  \ mat depicts the creepy Shankshack and surrounding forest in all its glory.</p>\
  \ \n    <p><a href=\"/products/btpy8u1h\"><b>Pathfinder Issue #3</b></a>: This time\
  \ around, I dig into my notes from my old \"Shadow Under Sandpoint\" campaign and\
  \ pull the curtain back on Paupers' Graves, a lonely, not-so-abandoned graveyard\
  \ found on the Lost Coast not far from Sandpoint. As far as graveyards go, Paupers'\
  \ Graves isn't all that great at keeping its dead in the ground, and the included\
  \ battle mat and encounter present the domain of Jediah Kheln, the region's ghoulish\
  \ master. As a bonus, you'll find stats for some undead dogs I've been calling \"\
  ghoul hounds\" for several years. I've been trying to get them into a bestiary for\
  \ a while, but they kept getting cut, so I just threw them in here. I'm happy to\
  \ report that they managed to paralyze the characters of some of the folks who shall\
  \ remain unnamed who saw fit to cut them in the first place. Ahhh... sweet revenge.</p>\

  \   <p><a href=\"/products/btpy8wam\"><b>Pathfinder Issue #4</b></a>: Now we head\
  \ on over to Mosswood, at the very eastern edge of the Sandpoint hinterlands. This\
  \ issue features a gazetteer of these goblin- (and worse) infested woods, focusing\
  \ on four significant encounter areas within. One of these, a lost shrine to Gozreh\
  \ known today as the Spider Stones, is featured in this issue's encounter. I'll\
  \ give you one guess as to what kind of monsters you can expect to fight at the\
  \ SPIDER Stones. As a bonus, our iconic druid Lini and her faithful snow leopard\
  \ Droogami get stat blocks too!</p> \n    <p><a href=\"/products/btpy8wr9\"><b>Pathfinder\
  \ Issue #5</b></a>: This time around, a shocking plot twist in the comic gives me\
  \ a chance to go back to \"Burnt Offerings\" and expand upon something that I didn't\
  \ have time to fully explore in that first adventure—the evil and mutation-causing\
  \ waters of Lamashtu. Rules for what happens when you drink too much of this stuff\
  \ are presented, and then we have a four-page encounter with the Bloodfang Goblins\
  \ of Mosswood, including stats for their commander, Big Chief Wortus, a cleric of\
  \ Lamashtu who might just have some plans for those evil waters of Lamashtu.</p>\
  \ \n    <p><a href=\"/products/btpy8wrg\"><b>Pathfinder Issue #6</b></a>: The first\
  \ story arc comes to a close in Issue #6, and since Lamashtu's cult has played such\
  \ an important part in the comic (and indeed in \"Burnt Offerings\" as well), I'm\
  \ taking this opportunity to explore something I've been hinting at in print for\
  \ years—the reason the demon lords Lamashtu and Pazuzu are so interested in the\
  \ Lost Coast. Also included is an encounter area for a shrine of Lamashtu—a shrine\
  \ that happens to be the personal temple to one of the most powerful clerics of\
  \ the Mother of Monsters in Varisia!</p> \n    <p>The first six issues of the Pathfinder\
  \ Comic will be available in <a href=\"/products/btpy8wr4\">graphic novel format</a>,\
  \ in stores April 2013!</p> \n    <p>James Jacobs<br> <i>Creative Director</i></p>\
