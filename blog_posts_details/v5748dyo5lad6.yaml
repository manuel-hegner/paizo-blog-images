  artist: "+1 for every 6 levels after 5th. Inspire competence also increases by +1\
    \ for every 4 levels after 3rd. We have also made starting and maintaining a bardic\
    \ performance a bit easier. At 1st level, starting a bardic performance is a standard\
    \ action, but this changes to a move action at 7th level and a swift action at\
    \ 13th. Regardless of the action needed to start a performance, maintaining a\
    \ performance is a free action, meaning that the bard can keep up a performance\
    \ and still cast spells, move, and make attacks. Moving on"
