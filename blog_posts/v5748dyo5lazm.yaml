  \   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, May 18, 2010</p> \n   <p><a href=\"/pathfinderChronicles/v5748btpy8emo\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Chronicles: Faction Guide</i></a> presents 24 example factions, rules\
  \ for how PCs can gain reputations and status in these organizations, and rewards\
  \ for PCs who pursue such things. The goal of this book isn’t to present the history\
  \ and reach of these factions in detail, but to give codify ways (and incentives)\
  \ for PCs to become involved with these group and provide unique benefits for achieving\
  \ high status within an organization. Though this book is written primarily for\
  \ GMs, it has no secrets that should be kept from the eyes of players, and each\
  \ faction takes up exactly two pages so a GM can hand over all the necessary information\
  \ for a faction to an interested player.</p> \n   <p>What follow are three examples\
  \ of faction rewards PCs can earn, all of which require the character to be in good\
  \ standing with the faction (about what you’d expect after doing two or three levels’\
  \ worth of adventures relating to the faction’s interests) and “spending” some of\
  \ the goodwill they’ve earned for their work.</p> \n   <blockquote>\n    <table\
  \ border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"> \n     <tbody>\n      <tr>\n\
  \       <td><b>Church of Razmir</b>: Gain the title “Priest of the Third Step.”\
  \ Priests may purchase drugs and poisons from the church at a 10% discount. Priests\
  \ also gain a +1 bonus on saving throws against poison and have free access to temple\
  \ concubines and church-run businesses that require a cover fee (such as bars, brothels,\
  \ clubs, gambling halls, or restaurants). <i>A high-reputation member of the Church\
  \ can earn a magical blessing from Razmir himself, granting the faction member certain\
  \ spell-like abilities.</i></td>\n       <td><a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderChronicles/PZO9221-CultOfRazmir.jpg\"\

  \ border=\"0\"></a></td>\n      </tr> \n      <tr> \n       <td><b>Prophets of Kalistrade</b>:\
  \ Acquire a litter and four strong servants (LN commoner 1) to bear the character\
  \ around in it. The litter-bearers are willing to work in civilized areas or on\
  \ roads, but not on rough terrain. Spending an additional 1 CPA means the litter-bearers\
  \ are 1st-level monks, rather than commoners, and fight to defend the character,\
  \ even to the death. Spending an additional 2 CPA upgrades the litter to an enclosed\
  \ palanquin, increases the number of bearers to six, and adds another servant to\
  \ carry the character’s banner and proclaim her arrival at appropriate junctures.\
  \ The typical term of service for a litter-bearer is 2 years. <i>A high-reputation\
  \ Prophet can sell items at a higher profit, gain slavishly loyal bodyguards, and\
  \ even acquire a lavish estate in Druma.</i></td>\n       <td><a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderChronicles/PZO9221-ProphetsOfKalistrade.jpg\"\

  \ border=\"0\"></a></td>\n      </tr> \n      <tr> \n       <td><b>Whispering Way</b>:\
  \ Arrange a conjuring of an extraplanar undead (such as a devourer) or an incorporeal\
  \ undead in a ritual similar to <i>planar ally</i> or <i>planar binding</i>. The\
  \ character must negotiate and pay for the undead’s service, though he can spend\
  \ CPA to have disciples of the Way pay the price for the service. If the character\
  \ is a poor negotiator, he can pay 1 CPA to hire a charismatic advocate to bargain\
  \ on his behalf. If the creature has the ability to create spawn, the spawn are\
  \ not under the control of the character. <i>A high-reputation member of the Way\
  \ can learn necromancy versions of non-necromantic spells, acquire an undead “homunculus,”\
  \ and even transform into an intelligent, free-willed undead.</i></td>\n       <td><a\
