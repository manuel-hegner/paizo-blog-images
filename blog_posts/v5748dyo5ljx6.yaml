  \    </div> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">I had the pleasure of working on this\
  \ month's highly anticipated Pathfinder Player Companion release, <a href=\"/products/btpy9tom?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Adventurers-Armory-2\"\
  ><em>Adventurer's Armory 2</em></a>. It had been a few years since I developed a\
  \ player companion, and I was excited for the chance to tackle the follow-up to\
  \ the most popular product in the line to date, <a href=\"/products/btpy8dmf?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Adventurers-Armory\"\
  ><em>Adventurer's Armory</em></a>. No pressure, right? Luckily, I wasn't going it\
  \ alone. As discussed <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ljwk?Of-Packages-and-Poppets\"\
  >last week</a>, the inimitable Ron Lundeen did a thorough pass on the book before\
  \ it ever hit my desk, leaving me that much more time to really delve into the most\
  \ exciting elements of the project.</p> \n    <p>My favorite is the armor and weapon\
  \ modifications system that appears in the Implements of War section. This system\
  \ allows a player to customize his or her weapons and armor in more versatile and\
  \ less expensive ways than adding magical enhancement bonuses and plus-based special\
  \ abilities, and first appeared in <a href=\"/products/btpy8emo?Pathfinder-Chronicles-Faction-Guide\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Faction Guide</em></a> back in 2010.</p> \n  \
  \  <p>We expanded on the handful of modifications that appeared in that book, with\
  \ six weapon modifications and eight armor modifications, allowing a player to increase\
  \ a suit of armor's maximum Dexterity stat, treat a weapon as belonging to a different\
  \ fighter weapon group, or grant a weapon a new special quality like brace, disarm,\
  \ nonlethal, or trip, among many other customizations.</p> \n    <p>Each of these\
  \ modifications comes with a drawback in addition to the cost of adding the modification\
  \ to the piece of equipment. A modified weapon requires a level of proficiency one\
  \ level higher than normal to wield, turning a simple weapon into a martial weapon\
  \ and a martial weapon into an exotic one. This means that characters with automatic\
  \ proficiency with all martial weapons will get the most out of the system, and\
  \ it further lets fighters, cavaliers, rangers, and paladins customize their load-outs\
  \ to fill more specialized narrative and tactical niches. Each armor modification\
  \ comes with its own unique drawback, such as increasing the armor check penalty\
  \ or adding extra weight to already heavy armor.</p> \n    <p>In both cases, however,\
  \ a variety of new feats allow player characters to ignore drawbacks, more quickly\
  \ apply modifications on the fly, or add more than one to the same piece of equipment.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>What weapon or suit of armor are you most excited to apply a modification\
  \ to? What new weapons and armor from <em>Adventurer's Armory 2</em> do you think\
  \ will lend themselves best to this new subsystem? Let us know in the comments below,\
  \ and maybe if we ever do an <em>Adventurer's Armory 3</em> we'll take them to even\
  \ finer levels of customization.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a\
