  \ \n     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Korakai’s earliest memory\
  \ is of roiling seas. When he was but an egg, his family left the tengu homeland\
  \ of Kwanlai, first trekking west to the port city of Goka before boarding a ship\
  \ to the Inner Sea in search for a better life. Like many immigrants from Tian Xia,\
  \ they headed for Absalom; however, where they eventually settled was not the City\
  \ at the Center of the World, but the nearby Isle of Erran. </p> \n      <p style=\"\

  \ align=\"left\" alt=\"Korakai key art, credited to Wayne Reynolds\"></a> \n   \
  \   <p>Korakai hatched and grew up on those shores, running barefoot on the beaches\
  \ and rocks. Each day, his mother would dive beneath the waves, holding her breath\
  \ to collect shellfish, seaweed, and other ingredients that Korakai carried to his\
  \ family’s tavern. There, his father would cook and brew specialties both Tien and\
  \ Avistani, many a mix of both. The tavern soon became a bustling place for sailors\
  \ in port, and as Korakai took orders and carried drinks, he’d catch wind of stories\
  \ from distant lands that he longed to see for himself.</p> \n      <p>Every so\
  \ often, sailors would complain of ill winds or other troubles, and wonder whether\
  \ the superstitions that tengu could ward off bad luck were true. Whenever they’\
  d ask, Korakai’s father would interject, “Kora, go tell your grandfather someone’\
  s here for him.” The old tengu with the faded feathers was well known among the\
  \ sailors for his raucous stories and his rituals to dispel misfortune. Though Korakai\
  \ suspected that much of the time, his grandfather was putting on a show, he knew\
  \ that whenever the older tengu asked for his “walking stick”—a khakkhara, a ringed\
  \ prayer staff that had been in the family for generations—what followed would be\
  \ nothing less than a glimpse of old Kwanlai. As his grandfather glided in a whirling\
  \ dance over the deck of a ship, magical feather fan in one hand and staff in the\
  \ other, even Korakai’s clumsy grasp of the Tengu language could catch words of\
  \ power amid the chiming of the staff’s rings.</p> \n      <br clear=\"all\"> \n\
  \      <p>One day, Korakai demanded to go with his grandfather out on the seas.\
  \ A ferry needed to cross the channel to Kortos for much-needed medicines, despite\
  \ signs of a storm, and the captain wanted a tengu on board. At first, it seemed\
  \ like they would evade the worst, but the sea changes in the blink of an eye. A\
  \ rogue gust pitched the vessel, almost knocking Korakai overboard, and he reached\
  \ out with his hand for purchase, finding the end of his grandfather’s staff. For\
  \ a moment, he clutched the staff, his grandfather holding the other end—then, the\
  \ heirloom snapped. Korakai’s hand came away with broken metal, and as the khakkhara’\
  s rings scattered into the raging sea, Korakai fell with them. The taste of salt\
  \ assailed his open beak. </p> \n      <p>The light from the surface growing distant,\
  \ Korakai glimpsed a shadow moving through the water toward him: a feathered shape,\
  \ drinking gourd in one hand. Korakai reached his hand out for help, but the figure\
  \ was swept away in a twin current of air and water, and Korakai could have sworn\
  \ he saw a bearded man and a long-haired woman in the spiraling riptide. Again,\
  \ Korakai tried to swim toward the currents, but again, shadows clashed together—\
  a serpentine creature with a mane of lightning and a pearl-scaled sailfish battled\
  \ a dragon with salt talons and an invisible force that churned the water into a\
  \ glaring eye. Blasted back by their conflict, Korakai resigned himself to his fate\
  \ and sank into the depths. </p> \n      <p>He fell for minutes, for hours, for\
  \ an eternity, the surface a distant memory. Against flashes of lightning that had\
  \ no right shining this far down, Korakai glimpsed gods, spirits, and more primordial\
  \ things. Yet he saw that each shape, no matter how powerful, always coalesced from\
  \ the same elements, and always returned to them once their business was done. In\
  \ that moment, Korakai understood something, and with a peal of thunder, he broke\
  \ the surface of the water.</p> \n      <p>On deck, Korakai coughed out seawater.\
  \ The storm had ended, and though the sails were torn, the crew was miraculously\
  \ unharmed. The sailors cheered for Korakai’s grandfather, thinking he had warded\
  \ off the tempest, but the two tengu knew that it was no jinx-eating superstition\
  \ to thank, but something deeper; the storm hadn’t passed at all, it had come to\
  \ reside within Korakai. As he released his grip on the now-broken staff, sparks\
  \ danced between his talons. </p> \n      <p>In the years that followed, Korakai\
  \ learned how to channel and direct—never command—the powers he had discovered in\
  \ the tempest. As his grandfather grew older, Korakai helped more and more with\
  \ the elder tengu’s duties, and when he passed peacefully in his sleep one spring\
  \ evening, sailors came from far and wide to witness Korakai return his ashes to\
  \ the sea, each ship releasing a paper lantern to float across the waves in his\
  \ memory. Not long thereafter, Korakai decided to leave the island. His parents\
  \ were supportive; after all, they had crossed half of Golarion once before, why\
  \ should they object to their son doing the same? Taking up his grandfather’s broken\
  \ staff, Korakai boarded the next ship out, trading the promise of good luck for\
  \ passage to distant ports.</p> \n      <p>Now, Korakai wanders the world with nothing\
  \ more than the desire to see new sights and collect new experiences, above all\
  \ hoping to one day visit Kwanlai for himself. Yet even so, he writes home often,\
  \ sending coin for the tavern when he can, knowing that the beach he grew up on\
  \ is but an ocean away.</p> \n      <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold;\"\
