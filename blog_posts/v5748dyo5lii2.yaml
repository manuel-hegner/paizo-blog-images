  \ Adventure Path</a>, Paizo's first Adventure Path for evil Player Characters! I\
  \ had the honor (and deep cathartic pleasure) to write the first in the new series,\
  \ wherein the forces of devil-influenced Cheliax strike back against a legion of\
  \ noble invaders.</p> \n    <p>But lest you assume that this be six volumes of mustache-twirling,\
  \ here's seven things you might not know about (or can look forward to in) \"The\
  \ Hellfire Compact!\"</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb180\">\n     <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderAdventurePath/PZO90103-Losoni.jpg\"\

  \ \n     <p><b>1. Small Evils</b> So you're evil! But you're first level. That means\
  \ you're probably the meanest fighter around... with a short sword, or the baddest\
  \ wizard in town... with <i>magic missile</i>. Sure, you can still mess a few goody\
  \ two-shoes up, but you're a ways off from indoctrination into the Hellknights or\
  \ raising that army of the undead. So, part of my challenge with \"The Hellfire\
  \ Compact\" was to highlight \"small evils.\" While you'll find true devils and\
  \ murderous monsters aplenty in the adventure, you'll also engage with wickedness\
  \ rooted in simple greed, enviousness, resentment, alcoholism, bad parenting, and\
  \ other all too familiar evils. You'll also be asked to commit evil acts, but slaying\
  \ angels and good dragons aren't for you yet. Can you execute an innocent? Crush\
  \ a town's faith? Murder a protective house spirit? Put an end to a pair of heroes'\
  \ perfect retirement? Fight a puppy? Oh, there's still arrogant paladins and obnoxiously\
  \ good outsiders to punish, but evil starts small and, as is often the case, might\
  \ even be a little too familiar. If you're going to do this, you better think long\
  \ and hard about why your character is hard as nails, because no one's Sauron at\
  \ level one. So... do you have the stomach for evil?</p> \n     <p><b>2. Faux Western</b>\
  \ I was halfway through writing this adventure before I realized, \"Whoa! This is\
  \ a western!\" And it sort of is! While it's not set in a dusty, one-horse town,\
  \ it's got pretty much everything else. Sheriff? Check. Ranchers? Check. Evil landowner?\
  \ Check. Hanging? Check. Mounted combat? Check. Mysterious, masked good guy? Check.\
  \ Gang of baddies terrifying innocent locals? That's you! It wasn't entirely intentional,\
  \ but once I realized it, I sort of embraced it for the first and second acts. For\
  \ the third act, well... there aren't a lot of tree forts in westerns, but two out\
  \ of three ain't bad.</p> \n     <p><b>3. Final Countdown</b> There's revolution\
  \ brewing in Longacre and you're in charge of stopping it. Your not being villains\
  \ just to be villains, you're being villains to keep nastier villains in control.\
  \ You have three weeks to bring the boot down on the burgeoning revolution and crush\
  \ its sympathizers. You'll have to measure your deeds, making sure you're quelling\
  \ the uprising and not driving more people to the rebel cause. If you do nothing,\
  \ Longacre will be a revolutionary bastion in three weeks. If you act rashly, it\
  \ might happen sooner. But if you measure ferocity and intimidation in the proper\
  \ proportions, no one will ever step out of line in Longacre again.</p> \n     <p><b>4.\
  \ Your Own Creepy Dream Home!</b> You're going to be in Longacre for a while, so\
  \ you better have a place to stay—and, trust me, the local innkeeper doesn't want\
  \ you. Fortunately there's a whole, unused, slightly dilapidated, probably not haunted\
  \ house right on the outskirts of town just waiting for new owners. So, if you've\
  \ always dreamed of owning your own personal Crimson Peak, now you can! </p>\n \
  \    <p><b>5. Boy Dryads</b> The number of boy dryads in official Pathfinder products\
  \ rises to two—and this one wants to teach you all about clonal colonies. (For Pathfinder's\
  \ first \"guyad,\" check out the <a href=\"/products/btpy9e2e\"><em>Pathfinder:\
  \ Origins #5</em></a> comic.</p> \n     <p><b>6. @#$%-Up Some Leshys</b> Take that,\
  \ adorable plant-people!</p> \n     <p><b>7. Strange Aeons Foreshadow</b> Six months\
  \ from now, the Strange Aeons Adventure Path is going to start. I also wrote the\
  \ first adventure for that AP. There's a single line in \"The Hellfire Compact\"\
  \ that suggests a tragic event unfolding in Ustalav. Think you can guess what it\
  \ is?</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>There's plenty more (and plenty worse) to\
  \ come, but I'll let you read about it or play it yourself.</p> \n    <p><a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9j6n\">\"The Hellfire Compact\"</a> comes out this month. And to help\
  \ you prepare for the campaign, keep an eye out for the <em>Hell's Vengeance Player's\
  \ Guide</em> later this month. Also, you might want to consider preordering <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9ipr\"><em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Path of the Hellknight</em></a>,\
  \ another book I wrote all about playing characters who could fit perfectly into\
  \ this campaign: Hellknights! (More details on that soon.)</p> \n    <p>So, if you've\
  \ got the stomach for evil and more than just a thing for black armor, start your\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/hellsVengeance\">Hell's Vengeance</a> campaign\
  \ with \"The Hellfire Compact.\" The road to Hell starts here and it surely is paved\
  \ with good intentions...</p> \n    <p>...Those of the paladins and cherubs you're\
  \ about to crush.</p> \n    <p>Good luck, villains!</p> \n    <p>F. Wesley Schneider<br>\
