               <blockquote> 
                <p>To give people a taste of the Pathfinder Tales novel line, Paizo's fiction editor solicits short prequels for the web fiction page. These stories allow us authors to show a glimpse of what happens to our heroes between books. I appreciate the opportunity to go darker or funnier or just a little different from the novels while showcasing the same protagonists.</p> 
                <p>I love them.</p> 
                <p>Paizo also posts chapter excerpts from the novels, often from the middle of the book, with glorious full-color artwork.</p> 
                <p>I <i>hate</i> them.</p> 
                <div class="blurb120">
                 <a href="/products/btpy8u7i"><img src="/image/product/catalog/PZO/PZO8511_120.jpeg" border="0"></a>
                </div> 
                <p>Well, I love that Paizo is showing off beautiful art and a sample chapter, but why is it never Chapter One? That drives me crazy! I wrote the chapters in order, damn it, and I think the first one is a pretty good introduction to the story. Why can't that be the excerpt?</p> 
                <p>So I complain, as anyone who's read my editor's blog knows all too well. And he responds with perfectly reasonable-sounding explanations like, "We wanted to show off some action, because we like your fight scenes." (That's a dirty trick, the appeasa-flatter.) Or maybe he'll say, "We loved this character and wanted an excuse to commission a painting of her." (I loved her too, so I'm thwarted.)</p> 
                <p>But, damn it! I still want everyone to read Chapter One (and Two and Three) before Chapter Four. And so I keep complaining, and my editor keeps posting lists of things authors should never say to editors, and so it goes.</p> 
                <p>But something different happened this time. I don't know, maybe my editor was just tired, or maybe the stars were right. I suspect the enlistment of publicity impresario Jaym Gates might have been a factor. The result is that you can follow the links from <a href="http://www.blackgate.com/black-gate-online-fiction-pathfinder-tales-queen-of-thorns-chapter-one-the-midsummer-masquerade/" target="_blank">blackgate.com</a> to <a href="http://www.flamesrising.com/queen-of-thorns-preview/" target="_blank">flamesrising.com</a> to <a href="http://www.sfsignal.com/archives/2012/11/guest-post-dave-gross-presents-chapter-3-of-pathfinder-tales-queen-of-thorns/" target="_blank">sfsignal.com</a> and finally to paizo.com (below) to read Chapters One, Two, Three, and Four of <a href="/products/btpy8u7i"><i>Queen of Thorns</i></a>.</p> 
                <p>If you like what you read, I hope you'll buy a copy of the book. And if you like that, I hope you'll tell everyone you know to buy one, too.</p> 
                <p>In the meantime, let's thank our hosts at all the participating websites, as well as Jaym Gates and my long-suffering editor, James Sutter, for making this happen.</p> 
                <p>I promise not to complain for the rest of the week.</p> 
                <h3>About This Chapter</h3> 
                <p>After Prince of Wolves and Master of Devils, in which the boys spend much of their time on separate journeys, for Queen of Thorns I wanted a plot closer to a classical quest fantasy with a group of heroes. You know, like a Fellowship or a Ring of Companions or something like that. So in Chapter Four, Count Jeggare assembles a party that leaves Radovan wishing he'd stayed in Rivendell. I mean, Iadara.</p> 
                <p>Jokes aside, Kyonin is only superficially similar to Middle-earth. In addition to the fey creatures infesting the woods and the horde of demons threatening from the south, the Fierani Forest is full of half-forgotten archaeological sites, some concealing arcane or cosmological mysteries. What could be more exciting to a Pathfinder like Count Jeggare? Although, as things turn out, the expedition into the Fierani Forest might reveal as many secrets of Radovan's infernal heritage as of Varian's long-absent father.</p> 
               </blockquote> 
               <h2>Chapter Four: The Fierani Forest</h2> 
               <p>Somebody was making a hell of a racket, and not just in my nightmare. I'd been having a lot of those lately. I shook off the terrors, sat up, and rubbed sand out of my eyes.</p> 
               <p>Desna smiled. Nobody was getting murdered outside of dreamland. Arnisant just had Fumblewhatsit backed up against the campfire. </p> 
               <p>"Call off your animal! Great glens and gardens, he'll eat me in one bite!" The gnome wasn't tall enough to hold the skillet out of reach. He protected it with his body, but the hound's big jaws shook his confidence.</p> 
               <p>"Arni, get over here!"</p> 
               <p>The dog bounded and sat beside me, a long rope of drool running from his jaws.</p> 
               <p>The gnome scowled at Arni and set the skillet back on the fire. Fat black sausages sizzled in the pan.</p> 
               <p>"You all right, Fim?"</p> 
               <p>"Fimbulthicket," he winced as he pressed a hand to hip. "And I'm fine, thanks for asking. Dodging a hungry dog is nothing new, I'm sorry to say."</p> 
               <p>"Where's the boss?"</p> 
               <p>The gnome tilted his head in the direction of the brook. His baggy eyes told me the boss had kept him up late, as he had our last couple of nights in Omesta, quizzing him about his old man. It didn't help that we'd slept this last night in the forest just outside the elf and gnome city. The boss said it was supposed to get us prepared for the upcoming journey.</p> 
               <p>It was going to take a lot more than one night's camping to toughen up the gnome, who winced every time he moved. He probably hadn't spent a night out of a soft bed since he'd last seen Variel. That was around the time the boss was born, and I still had trouble thinking of him as working on a hundred years old.</p> 
               <p>I didn't mind sleeping on the ground so much as the fiends tearing through my dreams. I couldn't blame it on last night's supper, which had been pretty plain fare after all the rich elven goodies back in Iadara. No, I had a pretty good idea where my nightmares came from. They didn't come from the things I'd eaten. They came from the things I'd done.</p> 
               <p>As I pulled on my boots, the back of my neck itched. I looked around, saw nothing. Listening, I heard the sizzling meat on the fire, the water from the brook, and birdsong from the trees, but nothing out of order. Still, it felt like somebody was watching me.</p> 
               <p>I shook out my blanket and made a cloud of gray dog hair. No wonder I'd dreamed about wrestling a demon-bear. Whenever I slept near the boss, Arni waited for him to fall asleep before moving from the foot of his bunk to steal my covers, the big mooch.</p> 
               <p>The starknife rested behind the pack. I'd carried it with me ever since we'd left Ustalav. Even all the time I tramped through Tian Xia in a devil's body, I kept it near. A few times I'd had to use it to kill, but that's not why Azra gave it to me. Despite swearing to Bishop Senir that I'd never go back to Ustalav, I wondered sometimes whether Azra was waiting for me to return her knife and seal the offer she'd made me.</p> 
               <p>It was a stupid thing to think about. I wrapped the starknife in my blanket and stuffed them both into my pack.</p> 
               <p>I fetched my jacket off the tree where I'd hung it. It looked no worse for the dunking I'd taken back in Iadara. Most of my scrapes and bruises had healed, too. While the night I spent with Kemeili was fun, I was glad it was behind me. There'd been a time I'd have felt different. Maybe the problem was I'd spent a year stuck in a body nobody could love. Or maybe I'd had my fill of rough stuff for one lifetime.</p> 
               <p>My spurs slid into their elbow slots as I shrugged on the jacket. I rolled my shoulders to feel the slack hidden under the overlapping strips of red leather. It was the best jacket I'd ever had, and I liked feeling my tools close to hand. If I slapped my arms just so, razor-sharp blades filled my fingers. Even in a tight spot, it was easy to slip a rake or probe out of a hidden pocket.</p> 
               <p>I snagged a couple sausages from the skillet, juggling them as the fat dripped down my fingers. It was time I learned to be more careful around hot things.</p> 
               <p>Arnisant followed me out of camp. When I paused, he sat at my side and gave me a pitiful look.</p> 
               <p>I broke a sausage in half and held it up. "You stay off my bed. Got it?"</p> 
               <p>The Arnisant Falls started flowing. Before he could drown in his own puddle of drool, I dropped the sausage. He made it disappear and looked to me for more. I finished mine before I let him have the other half of his. Otherwise he'd harry me all the way to the brook.</p> 
               <p>We found the boss in the middle of the stream. He stood on a stone, his pose telling me he was halfway through the Thirty-Six Forms he'd learned from the masters of Dragon Temple. I'd learned the same exercises from a less reputable source. No surprise, the boss still practiced the Forms, and I had to admit he was a lot better at them than I was. Still, I made better use of them up close and personal.</p> 
               <p>I hopped onto a nearby stone and joined him. Usually we didn't go for more than a minute before he started pointing out my mistakes. This time he didn't say a word. We just let our bodies flow through the motions. </p> 
               <p>We finished and began again. As we Gathered the Sun and did Crane Steps Forth, I caught a movement out of the corner of my eye. The elf ranger Caladrel crouched on a branch overhanging the brook. He watched until we finished the second routine.</p> 
               <p>The boss looked at Caladrel. An unspoken message passed between them, and the elf dropped as light as a leaf to the ground. He set aside his bow and quiver, slipped the long elven curveblade off his back. Facing us, he imitated our movements as we did it all again.</p> 
               <p>By the time we reached Tip the Leaf, I knew he was one hell of a quick learner.</p> 
               <p>"Immaculate," the boss said when we were done. "Have you studied?"</p> 
               <p>Caladrel shook his head. "I practiced Willow-Oak calisthenics while training for the rangers. Your exercise seems to have a similar purpose."</p> 
               <p>They collected their weapons, and Arni and I followed them back to the campsite. Caladrel and the boss were the same height, a good five inches taller than me. As they locked step, the boss fell into the ranger's rolling gait. As long as I'd known him, he was a natural mimic, even when he wasn't trying.</p> 
               <p>It was good to see the boss in his long coat with the riffle scrolls slung around his chest. The Shadowless Sword hanging from his hip should have looked all wrong with his Chelish clothes, but somehow its black-and-gold lacquered scabbard seemed to fit in just perfect. When he drew the blade, it moved as swiftly as his Chelish rapier ever had. Swifter, even. He said that's how it got its name, because it moved too fast for the sun to throw a shadow behind it.</p> 
               <p>The one difference I noticed in the count lately was that he'd lost that little bit of gray in his hair. I couldn't tell whether he was using dye or magic, but it was only a matter of time before I caught him at it. He was getting old, even for a half-elf, but he hid it pretty good.</p> 
               <p>"Prince Amarandlon sent me to aid in your search," said Caladrel. He saw the boss's eyes narrow, same as me. "He explained that the expedition is under your command. I welcome the opportunity to learn from you."</p> 
               <p>The boss nodded, but he was preening on the inside. He likes having his toes kissed. I guess that can't be helped, when you're born into the richest family in the richest country in the world. "The prince's message said I should expect two others."</p> 
               <p>"Maybe Faunra?" I'd hoped to find that doe-eyed ranger in Omesta while the boss and Fimbulthicket planned our excursion, but the gnomes told me she'd flown back to Iadara. I made up for my disappointment by catching up on the sleep I'd lost with Kemeili.</p> 
               <p>The boss gave me a look, but Caladrel smiled. He was turning out to be a regular guy, despite the toe-kissing.</p> 
               <p>"I'm afraid not," said the elf. "I'm here for the rangers. The others will represent other concerns. Doubtless one will be the queen's creature."</p> 
               <p>The boss's eyebrow rose a bit. Otherwise he masked his suspicion pretty good.</p> 
               <p>"That reminds me," Caladrel said, rummaging in his pack. "I bring a gift from Prince Amarandlon."</p> 
               <p>"Your master has been most generous to me," said the boss. </p> 
               <p>"Actually, the gift is for your associate."</p> 
               <p>The boss masked his disappointment pretty bad.</p> 
               <p>Caladrel pulled out a dirt-colored cloth and handed it to me. It was light as a handkerchief, but I let it fall open and saw it was a full cloak with a hood.</p> 
               <p>"Thanks," I said, trying to sound polite. "But it's not really my style."</p> 
               <p>"Your red leathers stand out against the forest," said Caladrel. "With scouts from the Witchbole venturing ever closer, stealth is our first line of defense."</p> 
               <p>"It's kind of warm to wear a cloak, don't you think?"</p> 
               <p>"Try it on." </p> 
               <p>The boss gave me the look, so I threw the cloak over my shoulders. The hem fell just above the top of my boots, covering up my red jacket and pants. It wasn't too warm after all.</p> 
               <p>"Much better," said Caladrel. "Now you aren't visible from a mile away."</p> 
               <p>"Thanks." Maybe it'd get caught in a briar patch. Maybe a breeze would blow it into a ravine. I revised my wish list for Lady Luck.</p> 
               <p>Back at the camp, the gnome with the goofy name rolled his eyes when he saw we'd brought company for breakfast. When the boss told him to expect two more, he shuffled over to his pack and dug out more sausages. Grumbling as he rubbed his wrists, he said, "I hope they bring more provisions."</p> 
               <p>"It would appear one has," said Caladrel.</p> 
               <p>A tall figure came out of the forest. Mirror-bright armor glinted out from beneath a hooded elven cloak like mine. The warrior's backpack was twice the size of mine, and it came with a barn door of a shield and a rafter of a sword.</p> 
               <p>The newcomer dropped the pack. Pulling back the hood, she revealed herself as the Forlorn woman who'd slugged me at the queen's party.</p> 
               <p>"Desna weeps." Sometimes I forget and say it out loud.</p> 
               <p>Caladrel coughed. "Count Jeggare, allow me to introduce Oparal, paladin of Iomedae."</p> 
               <p>"Your Excellency." She made a stiff Chelish bow.</p> 
               <div class="blurb360">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8511-Oparal.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8511-Oparal_360.jpeg" border="0"></a>
                <br> Oparal can certainly handle herself in a fight.
               </div> 
               <p>The boss barely nodded, reminding her of the pecking order. With a sly smile, he said, "I believe you are already acquainted with my bodyguard, Radovan."</p> 
               <p>The black pupils of her steel-colored eyes slid toward me. Her nostrils flared. Her expression was almost comical except for the fact that my jaw still ached. Otherwise, I would have tipped her a wink to show I wasn't scared.</p> 
               <p>I wasn't. Not much, anyway.</p> 
               <p>"Hungry?" asked the gnome.</p> 
               <p>"Yes," said Oparal. "Our owl only just arrived."</p> 
               <p>At a nod from the boss, Oparal went to sit beside the fire. I made the "let's talk" sign. Caladrel caught the hint and joined the others at the fire while the boss and I strolled out of earshot.</p> 
               <p>"You sure this is a good idea? I mean, seriously—a paladin?" </p> 
               <p>"We could wish for no better ally if we encounter demons in the forest."</p> 
               <p>"We don't need one of these holy avengers. They make me nervous. You don't like them either. Besides, we've handled fiends before."</p> 
               <p>"I never said I don't like paladins. As for demons, you and I have only ever faced one or two at a time, usually with the Egorian Watch only a shout away."</p> 
               <p>"You're forgetting Iron Mountain."</p> 
               <p>"I forget nothing," he said. "Those were devils. And you were on their side."</p> 
               <p>He had to remind me of that. "I couldn't help it."</p> 
               <p>"All I am saying is that the circumstances are different."</p> 
               <p>"You weren't the one that ogress clobbered."</p> 
               <p>"I was not the one who offended her."</p> 
               <p>"Thanks for the sympathy." </p> 
               <p>The boss looked past me. That sly smile found its way back onto his face. "Perhaps our last companion will be more to your liking."</p> 
               <p>I turned to see her approach. Under an elven cloak she wore black-and-yellow leathers—wasp colors. A coiled whip hung at her back, pushing up her cloak like the bustle of a ball gown.</p> 
               <p>Kemeili planted a fist on her hip and smiled at me. "You didn't think I'd let you get away that easily, did you?"</p> 
               <p align="center">∗ ∗ ∗</p> 
               <p>Caladrel paused and raised a hand. He lowered it, palm-down. We all crouched low. Even Arnisant lay down without needing to be told. Clever boy.</p> 
               <p>Whatever the ranger spotted, I was glad to set down my overstuffed pack. The boss kept his books in his satchel, but I was the one hauling around the rest, including his tent. At least he had all his little scrolls and widgets in his coat and bandolier.</p> 
               <p>Caladrel beckoned the boss forward. I went with him.</p> 
               <p>We peered through some bushes at a mob of demons ambling through the forest. They wore the bodies of elves, some of them in scraps of ranger leathers, but there was no mistaking them for real elves. They jiggled with every step, glutted with something wriggling inside them. I counted seventeen of the damned things.</p> 
               <p>"Vermleks," whispered Caladrel. </p> 
               <p> "I will lead the attack," said Oparal, who'd joined us without an invitation. She shrugged off her pack and set her shield on an arm as thick as mine. Traced in gold on the shield's face was the image of a winged, eagle-headed woman.</p> 
               <p>"No," said the boss. "There are too many for us simply to rush in."</p> 
               <p>"The count is right," said Caladrel. </p> 
               <p>"But we are less than half a day from Omesta," said Kemeili, who I hadn't even heard creep up on us. "They have never come so close before."</p> 
               <p>"They have, and more often than you might think," said Caladrel. "But we are charged with protecting the queen's guest. You take your duty seriously, don't you, Oparal?"</p> 
               <p>"I—" Oparal looked at the boss and me. "I do."</p> 
               <p>"Then wait. With your permission, Count Jeggare ...?" </p> 
               <p>The boss gave him the nod, and Caladrel drew an arrow from his quiver. I could have sworn the fletching moved itself into his fingers, like the container was handing it to him. He nocked the arrow. On its tip was a lump that looked like a plant bulb.</p> 
               <p>The boss whispered to Oparal. "Caladrel knows the forest. We will follow his lead."</p> 
               <p>"Of course, Excellency."</p> 
               <p>"In the field, call me Varian."</p> 
               <p>I didn't like having a cloak on me, even if it didn't make me too hot. I dropped it on the ground. As an afterthought, I shrugged off my jacket, too. Oparal looked at me like I was stupid. Maybe she was right, but I didn't want demon gore all over my new leathers.</p> 
               <p>Caladrel popped up and back down so quick that I noticed the sound of his bow only after I realized he was moving. The demons heard it, and some of them looked back in our direction. A few stared so hard I felt like they were looking straight at me. I moved real quiet-like, and their elven eyes followed me.</p> 
               <p>Past the demons, the arrow hit the ground with a squelching sound. That got the attention of all the demons. Wailing, they rushed toward the arrow, shoving each other to reach it first.</p> 
               <p>"The scent drives them mad," Caladrel whispered. He pointed through the brush at a pair of demons ripping hunks of meat off each other. Caladrel nodded up toward the forest canopy. "It also attracts help." </p> 
               <p>At first it looked like cones were dropping from the high branches, but there were no pines around. The "cones" were fist-sized wasps.</p> 
               <p>"Well done, Caladrel," said Kemeili.</p> 
               <p>The demons noticed nothing but what was between them and the scent. The wasps swarmed over them. For a few moments, the demons didn't seem to notice. Then one began screaming and slapping at its elven body. Its head swelled and darkened. An instant later, it burst open like a rotten melon. A liver-colored worm's head burst out through its gaping neck, squealing as it squirmed free of its wasp-stung body.</p> 
               <p>"Now?" Oparal had her hand on her sword.</p> 
               <p>"Let them weary themselves," said Caladrel.</p> 
               <p>An impatient growl rumbled in Oparal's chest. She sounded like Arnisant when he spied a cat. She was spoiling for a fight.</p> 
               <p>Six or seven of the demons raised their stolen hands above their heads, gurgling unholy prayers. The air around them congealed. The wasps fell to the ground while the demons crushed the insects in a frenzy of slaps and stomps.</p> 
               <p>"Now," said the boss.</p> 
               <p>By the time I realized Caladrel had stood, he'd unleashed three or four arrows. One jutted from the chest of a vermlek, blood spurting through its hollow shaft.</p> 
               <p>Oparal charged the demons. Her sword struck quick as lightning and blazed twice as bright. Two demons came up behind her, black energy surrounding their hands as they reached for her. The boss riffled a scroll, and two gray bolts of magic struck each vermlek in the face. They howled and clutched their eyes as Oparal whipped her sword around and opened their bellies. Bloody worms as thick as my arm poured out of the wounds. Below each thick head, the worms split into four long tails, the tails further tipped with nests of countless tiny tentacles. The abandoned elf bodies slumped to the ground.</p> 
               <p>The boss tucked his expended scroll back into his bandolier. I stayed close in case one of the worms went for him. Arni did the same, barking as a worm shot quick as a snake past Oparal. The hound jumped in front of the boss, but the demon didn't go for the count.</p> 
               <p>It raised a dripping tail and pointed straight at me. In the squealing tongue of demons, it called out to its wormy buddies. Their heads swiveled in my direction. They rushed me.</p> 
               <p>I tensed, deciding whether to stand or dodge. </p> 
               <p>With a crack, Kemeili's whip caught the first vermlek by one of its wormy tails. The demon struggled to get free, but the curved flaps of the whip held it tight. Kemeili pulled it off course, giving me all the room I needed.</p> 
               <p>I planted the big knife a couple of feet below the worm's five-jawed mouth. Dark blood sprayed up as I pulled out the blade, but the demon barely grunted at the wound. Maybe that's not where it kept its heart.</p> 
               <p>Or maybe vermleks don't need hearts.</p> 
               <p>It rammed its head against my ribs, knocking the breath out of me. Arnisant's jaws caught the worm just below its head. The hound shook once, twice, and the third time tore away a mass of ruined flesh and six inches of bloody windpipe.</p> 
               <p>Turns out vermleks do need windpipes.</p> 
               <p>We left it flopping on the ground and turned to stop the next one coming toward me. None even came close.</p> 
               <p>Caladrel and the boss each put down another one with their swords. The ranger's big two-hander moved so fast that all I could see was its red blur. It hummed as it moved, louder when it touched a demon. In the instant it was out of its sheath, the boss's Shadowless Sword was damned near invisible. It looked as if everywhere he pointed his hand, some magic power tore wounds in the demons' flesh.</p> 
               <p>Oparal cut the legs out from under two vermleks trying to break away. As the worms escaped their host bodies, she chopped them into pieces. </p> 
               <p>Kemeili twisted the handle of her whip. Three long, wicked barbs grew from its tip. She lashed a vermlek across the belly, revealing the worm inside. With another stroke, she tore it out of its shelter. I filled it with darts from my jacket sleeves. It flopped a few times and lay still.</p> 
               <p>It was over before I'd worked up a good lather. I thought about how the vermleks had looked at me, then I began to sweat.</p> 
               <p>Oparal looked at me herself, eyes narrowing. The white light of her sword began fading. She raised it up and chopped the head off another demon.</p> 
               <p>Caladrel joined her in the beheadings. The closer his sword came to the vermleks, the more it glowed like blood on a lantern pane. As the demons died, so did the glow.</p> 
               <p>The boss had been right. It was good to have a couple demon slayers with us. I only hoped they didn't mistake me for one of the bad guys. </p> 
               <p>Kemeili wiped the gore off her whip while the gnome looked us over for injuries. A gnome-sized whirlwind floated just above the grass behind him, but it hadn't left his side during the battle. He didn't find any wounds on us. "Not even a scratch!" </p> 
               <p>Good thing, I thought as I fetched my jacket. Otherwise I'd have felt pretty silly setting aside what little armor I had. I promised myself not to do that again, even if it meant getting a little slime on my leathers.</p> 
               <p>"Don't sound so disappointed," Kemeili said to the gnome. "Or maybe next time just help us fight them."</p> 
               <p>He waved away her complaint. "I've seen scum like these a dozen times before. I knew you could handle them. They're boring."</p> 
               <p>The boss knelt to examine the dead demons. I counted time in my head until he broke out his sketchbook. Fourteen seconds—a new record.</p> 
               <p>Kemeili shot me a silent question. <i>What is he doing?</i> </p> 
               <p>I could have told her that the boss is a student of everything, but the truth is he likes weird stuff best. For instance, he calls himself a botanist—a fancy word for "gardener"—but the plants he likes most are the freaks like those whispering lilies he used to give his Pathfinder agents. They could plant one wherever they were, talk into the flower, and their words would come through lily's twin in the boss's greenhouse.</p> 
               <p>I could have told her that, but I didn't want to lead her on. If she'd finagled her way into the group because she couldn't get enough of me, well, who could blame her? On the other hand, it was way too convenient. If the queen had sent Oparal, that left the temple to send Kemeili. And while the Calistrians were bunches of fun with their temple baths and prostitutes, guile and revenge weren't high on my list of good times.</p> 
               <p>Kemeili waited for an answer until I shrugged and turned away, pretending to concentrate on cleaning the gore off my knife. Once the boss decided we had to bury the elven bodies and burn their demon hosts, I kept busy enough to avoid her for the rest of the afternoon.</p> 
               <p>After we finished, we hustled east until the boss called a halt at dusk.</p> 
               <p>It was about time, I figured, since I was carrying twice as much gear as anybody except the paladin, and I'd decided she was half giant.</p> 
               <p>Actually, she didn't look half bad. I liked how the sunlight made her black hair shine almost blue, but she never cracked a smile, especially when she saw me looking back at her.</p> 
               <p>The gnome dropped his pack. It hit the ground with a heavy thump. I grabbed the strap and hefted it. It was almost too much to lift in one hand.</p> 
               <p>"Hey, Thick. How do you haul so much?"</p> 
               <p>"Fimbulthicket," he corrected me, but then he smiled. He'd shaken off his morning grump, but he still winced as if every move brought out a bad ache in his bones. "I imbued myself with the might of an ant."</p> 
               <p>"An ant?" </p> 
               <p>"Proportionately, they are far more powerful than we gnomes. Even stronger than you humans." </p> 
               <p>He called me human, so I liked him a little better, despite his stupid name. "So you cast a spell?"</p> 
               <p>He nodded.</p> 
               <p>"You got to teach the boss that one." I touched my own aching back. It'd be worth one of his riffle scrolls to lighten my load. </p> 
               <p>The gnome shook his head. "It's not some arcane formula, but rather my connection to the Green that lends me power."</p> 
               <p>"I get it. You're more like a cleric than a wizard. But the boss is a clever guy. Maybe he could figure out a way to do with his scrolls what you do with your Green."</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps." The gnome shrugged, then brightened. "If he did, it would certainly be the first time that I ever heard of such a thing."</p> 
               <p>The boss doled out chores, and no one seemed to mind his giving orders. Caladrel made a fire as Kemeili skinned the hares he'd shot while he scouted ahead during our hike. She was good with a knife, as I knew better than most.</p> 
               <p>"Hey, boss. I could use a little help with that thing over there."</p> 
               <p>He glanced at Kemeili and back at me. We walked off far enough that I figured the elves wouldn't overhear us.</p> 
               <p>"I'm starting to think it's a bad idea to take Kemeili with us."</p> 
               <p>"She is an official representative of the temple of Calistria," he said. "You realize they are the most influential sect in Kyonin?"</p> 
               <p>"Yeah, yeah." He'd given me the long lesson before we'd arrived, and I could list the names of all the elf gods. I liked that they worshiped Lady Luck, same as me and the boss, but their favorite was Calistria, the Savored Sting. "I'm just saying I don't think she's here for the right reason. Even if she was, she's going to be a distraction."</p> 
               <p>"She is important not only to the success of our mission but to the continued goodwill of her temple, the court, and the queen herself."</p> 
               <p>"Sure, but—"</p> 
               <p>"Just keep her happy," he said. "That should not be too onerous. Or have you lost your touch with the ladies?"</p> 
               <p>"Lost my—? Hey, now. You know that's not a problem."</p> 
               <p>"I hear quite a few wild boasts, but when we face a situation that requires a certain subtle—"</p> 
               <p>"Fine."</p> 
               <p>"Fine?"</p> 
               <p>"Fine, I'll keep her happy."</p> 
               <p>"Excellent," he said, turning to go back to the others. He paused and added, "Just not near camp. Show some discretion."</p> 
               <p>The boss and Oparal went off to fetch water, talking as they went. I had his tent set up and his gear stowed inside by the time they returned with filled canteens and waterskins.</p> 
               <p>I stretched out Arnisant's supper by giving him a little at a time rather than throwing him a whole hare. By the time it was gone, he didn't even give me the starving dog routine. He just settled down at the boss's feet.</p> 
               <p>"What other varieties of fiend might we face?" the boss asked Caladrel.</p> 
               <p>"The list is endless," said Caladrel. "The vermlek are the least of them. I have fought over a dozen kinds, but many others lurk in Tanglebriar or await summons from the Abyss."</p> 
               <p>"This is why I returned to Kyonin," said Oparal. "To wipe this filth from our land."</p> 
               <p>Caladrel raised his leather tankard in salute. "May you touch the Brightness."</p> 
               <p>"A laudable goal," said the boss. "But I would be as glad to avoid them as to slaughter them. Our mission is to find Variel Morgethai."</p> 
               <p>"We are all here to help you find your father, Varian," said Kemeili. He usually told people to call him by his given name 'in the field,' as he put it. Still, I didn't like the way she said it. Maybe he would have to be the one to keep her happy. That thought was more annoying than I'd expected it to be. </p> 
               <p>"Are we certain he still lives?" said Oparal. "No one has seen him for almost a century."</p> 
               <p>"I would know if he had died," said the gnome. He rubbed his knuckles. "I would feel it."</p> 
               <p>The boss shot him a curious look. It was a weird thing to say. From the way everyone else looked away, I wasn't the only one who thought so.</p> 
               <p>The gnome picked up on it too. "I would feel it in the Green. Variel has always been a strong presence in the land."</p> 
               <p>Everybody nodded as if that explained everything, but it still killed the conversation.</p> 
               <p>Caladrel and Oparal discussed the best ways to kill demons. Lightning and poison were useless. Fire, frost, and acid weren't so good either, but that mattered more to the boss, who had to pick the right spells to write in his riffle scrolls. Since I'd had the big knife whammied in Goka, I was all set to slice off a hunk of demon.</p> 
               <p>As we banked the fire and got ready to sleep, I caught another of those looks from Kemeili. It was weird how she could look like a girl one moment—complete with a baby-doll voice that shouldn't have done it for me but, to be honest, kind of did—and then turn her head in the firelight to become all woman.</p> 
               <p>Well, maybe part tiger, too.</p> 
               <p>Sleep is what I wanted, and Kemeili looked like she had more than cuddles on her mind. I rolled up the elven cloak and shook out my jacket, trying to make it clear that I was ready for sleep.</p> 
               <p>"What's that?" said Oparal. She sat on a fallen log beside the fire, her big sword across her knees. "That image on your jacket."</p> 
               <p>I held it up, showing off the phoenix on the back. "Phoenix. Big flaming bird. They got them over in Tian Xia."</p> 
               <p>"Did you see one?"</p> 
               <p>"Yeah. Once. Kind of."</p> 
               <p>Oparal tilted her head to the side, obviously not buying my story.</p> 
               <p>"I had this jacket made to remind me of all the fights I had in Tian Xia. That's a land on the other side of the—"</p> 
               <p>"I know what Tian Xia is."</p> 
               <p>"Well, long story short, I got into a few tussles over there. Each of these pictures is kind of my souvenir."</p> 
               <p>"Trophies of your kills?"</p> 
               <p>I didn't like her tone. It didn't matter to me what god she wore on her shield. She had no business judging me. Still, I wasn't about to back down just because she wore shiny armor. "I didn't kill them all," I said. "Just the ones who got in my face with their righteous attitudes."</p> 
               <p>"That's no phoenix." She held up her shield to show off the bird-woman—which now that I looked closer, did bear some suspicious similarities to the symbol on my jacket. Not the same, but close enough to make me wonder what the artist had known. "It was someone bearing the symbol of my order, wasn't it?"</p> 
               <p>"Nah," I said. "It was a whole other country. Different gods and everything."</p> 
               <p>Oparal reached into a belt pouch and brought out a little jar. She opened it and dipped in a finger before drawing a little sun on her brow, across her lips, and on the armor over her heart. "Tell me again who you killed," she said. "I will know if you lie."</p> 
               <p>"That's enough," said the boss.</p> 
               <p>"So you know what he did?" said Oparal.</p> 
               <p>He didn't know, because I hadn't told him. The moment he hesitated to answer, Oparal knew it too.</p> 
               <p>"There were two of them," I said. "Well, one woman in two bodies. I think one of them was a paladin. I wasn't looking for a fight, but they were. This phoenix on my jacket, that's what was left of them afterward."</p> 
               <p>Oparal's eyes widened. No doubt she was surprised I'd told the truth.</p> 
               <p>"Like I said, I wasn't the one looking for a fight."</p> 
               <p> "You killed a paladin!" She dropped her jar of holy balm and drew her sword an inch from its sheath. It lit up the trees around us.</p> 
               <p>"Put that away," said Caladrel. "They can see that light in Razmiran."</p> 
               <p>When Oparal didn't move, the boss snapped, "Sheathe your weapon, or return to Iadara and tell the queen we have no use for you."</p> 
               <p>Oparal shoved the blade back into place, but her eyes never left my face. I folded the jacket so nobody else could see the phoenix or any of the other figures carved into its leather. Eventually I turned away from Oparal and walked out of camp, half-hoping the boss or Arni would follow. But they didn't.</p> 
               <p>I found a cozy spot just within range of the fire's light and sat down. What pissed me off about Oparal wasn't that she'd made me admit what I did. I didn't give a good damn what she thought. I just didn't like thinking about the people I'd killed. Most of them had it coming—killers themselves, or worse. Others came looking to kill me, and I shouldn't have felt a bit bad about killing them first.</p> 
               <p>But this phoenix paladin, when she'd found me, she thought she'd found a devil. A monster, not a man. I tried telling her otherwise, but she wouldn't listen. So I could say I hadn't killed her. She'd killed herself.</p> 
               <p>But that was a lie, and I knew it. The truth was that I beat her before I killed her. I could have walked away. Well, run away. But I could have got away—that was the point. I could have got away and left her there alive.</p> 
               <p>But that's not what I did.</p>

              <p class="date">Tuesday, October 30, 2012</p> 
              <div itemprop="articleBody"> 
               <p><span itemprop="description">So, there is an <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ldz2">announcement</a> on the Paizo blog about the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game going into semi-open playtests. The "collaborative deck-building game" (which is neither completely collaborative nor completely deck-building, but work with me) is probably the best game system I've ever designed, and I'd like to tell you a little bit about it.</span></p> 
               <p>The basic concept is this: It's a cooperative game for one to six players. Each player has a unique character composed of a deck of cards and a set of stats. Roleplayers will find the stats very familiar—characters have roles and numbers that define their abilities and skills. As you go through adventures, you'll improve your deck by acquiring new items, allies, weapons, and other cool things as you explore and overcome challenges; over time, you'll be customizing your deck to suit your own individual vision of your character. All adventures are composed of infinitely usable cards and decks. There's no Game Master, no recordkeeping, no expository dialogue. It's everything I want to do in a roleplaying game without the workload. It plays in an hour to an hour and a half.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/Blog/20121030-Ezren.jpg"><img src="/image/content/Blog/20121030-Ezren_120.jpeg" border="0" hspace="2"></a><a href="/image/content/Blog/20121030-ThemOgres.jpg"><img src="/image/content/Blog/20121030-ThemOgres_120.jpeg" border="0" hspace="2"></a><a href="/image/content/Blog/20121030-RustyDragon.jpg"><img src="/image/content/Blog/20121030-RustyDragon_120.jpeg" border="0" hspace="2"></a><a href="/image/content/Blog/20121030-Gogmurt.jpg"><img src="/image/content/Blog/20121030-Gogmurt_120.jpeg" border="0" hspace="2"></a>
                <br> These playtest cards were designed for single-sided, black-and-white printing. In the finished game, card borders will have colors instead of just shades of grey, and the charts that currently overlap the images on "Them Ogres Ain't Right" and "The Rusty Dragon" will move to the back of the card.
               </div> 
               <h2>How We Got Here</h2> 
               <p>About a year ago, Rian Sand came to me with a theoretical idea of a design space that hadn't yet been explored much: a card game that mimicked many of the behaviors of a traditional RPG, but without a lot of the time and administrative burden. I had also been thinking about some mechanics for a system like that, and Rian's enthusiasm and support made me invest serious design time into it. There were a lot of problems that had to be solved—persistence, goal development, game speed, and so on—and I'm pretty sure we solved them all.</p> 
               <p>The original game was for a new intellectual property that I'm not prepared to talk about yet. Suffice it to say that it's really cool, and Mike Vaillancourt and Matt Forbeck had a lot to do with making it cool, and you'll see it someday soon. Not sure when, not sure how, but soon.</p> 
               <p>But as we were doing this, we were thinking about what our first licensed game had to be. Various ideas were tossed around, but for Rian and me, there was only one choice. Rian was a major fan of the Pathfinder RPG, and I... well, I was a major fan of Paizo. Owners Vic Wertz and Lisa Stevens have shown considerable benevolence and respect my way over the past years, leading to such awesome projects as the Harrow Deck, the Kill Doctor Lucky color edition, Yetisburg, and the American version of Key Largo. Lone Shark has done more games for Paizo than for any other company, and if they were interested in following us down this garden path, they were going to get to do so.</p> 
               <p>It turns out that after a discussion with Paizo's Publisher Erik Mona and Chief Operating Officer Jeff Alvarez at the GAMA Trade Show, they were very interested. Pathfinder Lead Designer Jason Bulmahn saw a version of the system at the first unveiling at Gamestorm, and brought back much appreciated words of praise. I showed it to the Paizo team back in Redmond, including James Jacobs, Sarah Robinson, and Wes Schneider, and we were underway within a few weeks. And over those weeks, we were bombarded with very heavy books and offers to help from everyone on the Paizo staff. It became a project all of Paizo could participate in.</p> 
               <p>The game continued to grow and change under the Paizo stewardship. My talented developers Chad Brown, Paul Peterson, and Gaby Weidling quickly came to understand the magnitude of the challenge ahead of us. Pathfinder is huge. Paizo had given us the now-classic Rise of the Runelords Adventure Path as a template for our games, which meant we had to adapt an incredibly deep and involving series of stories into the few words and concepts that fit on cards. It was not so easy, but it made us examine and reexamine every aspect of my system to make it work. It's now much tighter and much more fun.</p> 
               <p>Under the codename "Project Swallowtail," we showed off a very raw version of it at PaizoCon, and a more robust version at Gen Con. And now we're going into a massive playtest with the Pathfinder Society to get the game exactly right. It's got a ways to get there, but it seems pretty good now. Time will tell.</p> 
               <h2>How the Game Plays</h2> 
               <p>You start by creating a party of adventurers. Each of you gets a character card such as Valeros, Seoni, or Merisiel. That card tells you what cards your deck consists of. A wizard might have more spells than weapons, and a fighter will likely have more weapons than spells.</p> 
               <p>You'll select an Adventure Path, which consists of several adventures, which consist of several scenarios. A typical scenario tells you what villains and henchmen you'll face (if any), and the locations in which you'll face them. Each location has a deck of cards, drawn at random from appropriate stacks, and then shuffled in with a villain or henchman. You won't know where the villain is until you find him.</p> 
               <p>Throughout the game, you'll explore locations, encounter monsters, and find new weapons, items, spells, and the like. But you're racing a clock. The adventure deck is a stack of cards that you'll flip one card off of every turn. If the adventure deck runs out of cards before you find and defeat the villain, you lose. If your character deck runs out of cards, you die.</p> 
               <p>But if you don't die, then you'll advance your character. You'll get to put new cards in your deck, expand your powers and abilities, and rebuild your deck for new adventures. If you defeat all the scenarios in the game, you'll be a mighty adventurer indeed.</p> 
               <p>Thanks for reading, and I hope you like the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game. I can't wait to see what you think.</p>

               <p>Called "The Urge to Evolve," this Tier 3–7 quest features a sinister plot by a powerful outsider who needs to consume humanoid spirits in order to increase its own might. Set in Magnimar, this adventure can easily be used during the Year of the Risen Rune as a time-filler or quick demo (using either 4th- or 7th-level pregenerated characters for those new to the game), and fits thematically with the Varisian focus of the current season. The adventure consists of just a single encounter and should take no more than an hour to complete, so organizers will likely have many opportunities to run it, even over the course of a single game day.</p> 
               <p>You can find the Chronicle sheet for this quest on its product page or download it below. We'll eventually release this as a standalone product like we did with "Ambush in Absalom," but for the foreseeable future, <a href="/products/btpy8va0"><i>Kobold Quarterly #23</i></a> is the place to get this exciting new adventure.

               <p>Halloween is less than a week away, so it's finally time to deliver on the cosmic horror I've been teasing for the last several weeks.</p> 
               <p>You've already seen the enormous Gug, which I've included again below since it is so awesome and fits the theme so well.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20120810-Gug.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20120810-Gug_180.jpeg" border="0"></a>
               </div> 
               <p><span itemprop="description">But the Gug is only one of THREE "mythos" monsters included in January's <a href="/products/btpy8v0b">Shattered Star</a> set of <a href="/store/byCompany/w/wizKids/byProductType/pathfinderMiniatures">Pathfinder Battles</a> prepainted fantasy miniatures. He happens to be the largest (by far), but he has plenty of company when it comes to monsters inspired by the writings of legendary horror author H.P. Lovecraft and his circle of author friends from the early 20th Century. Lovecraft is a bit of a patron saint as we approach Halloween (and just about every day of the year around Paizo, truth be told), and we've been incorporating creatures he imagined in the 20s and 30s into Pathfinder from the very start.</span></p> 
               <p>The <a href="/products/btpy8v0b">Shattered Star</a> set is no exception! Behold, the insidious Nightgaunt, terror of the darkened skies!</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20121026-Nightgaunt.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20121026-Nightgaunt_180.jpeg" border="0"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>This horrifying creature came straight from Lovecraft's mind, making its most notable appearance in his epic <a href="http://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/fiction/dq.asp" target="_blank">"Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath,"</a> one of the great author's more fantastical yarns. </p> 
               <p>In the words of the master:</p> 
               <blockquote> 
                <p><i>"Suddenly, without a warning sound in the dark, Carter felt his curved scimitar drawn stealthily out of his belt by some unseen hand. Then he heard it clatter down over the rocks below. And between him and the Milky Way he thought he saw a very terrible outline of something noxiously thin and horned and tailed and bat-winged. Other things, too, had begun to blot out patches of stars west of him, as if a flock of vague entities were flapping thickly and silently out of that inaccessible cave in the face of the precipice. Then a sort of cold rubbery arm seized his neck and something else seized his feet, and he was lifted inconsiderately up and swung about in space. Another minute and the stars were gone, and Carter knew that the night-gaunts had got him."</i></p> 
               </blockquote> 
               <p>WizKids did a marvelous job on this figure. The sheen on its very dark blue hide <i>looks</i> rubbery and cold. They captured the nightgaunt's bat-wings and noxious thinness very, very well. You definitely don't want to get scooped up by these guys on some moonless Golarion night.</p> 
               <p>The nightgaunts appear in the fifth installment of the <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/shatteredStar">Shattered Star Adventure Path</a>, <a href="/products/btpy8v2v">"Into the Nightmare Rift."</a> And I'm happy to say that they don't invade Golarion in this one, mostly because the player characters instead have to go to their vile home dimension of Leng!</p> 
               <p>Next up this week, we round out our cosmic horror with a creature created by one of Lovecraft's friends and collaborators, Frank Belknap Long. I speak of course of the legendary Hounds of Tindalos, from Long's 1931 story of the same name. The Hounds also appear in Lovecraft's "The Whisperer in Darkness," published the same year.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20121026-HoundOfTindalos.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20121026-HoundOfTindalos_180.jpeg" border="0"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Belknap Long's terrifying Hounds of Tindalos dwell in the very distant past, and access the present through the angles of time to menace folk with their canine bodies and evil, hollow tongues designed for draining bodily fluids. They secrete a strange blue ichor from their hides. From the story:</p> 
               <blockquote> 
                <p><i>"They are lean and athirst!" he shrieked... "All the evil in the universe was concentrated in their lean, hungry bodies. Or had they bodies? I saw them only for a moment, I cannot be certain."</i> — Frank Belknap Long, "The Hounds of Tindalos"</p> 
               </blockquote> 
               <p>Well, Frank, they have bodies, complete with gross backwards-bending legs and nasty claws. And they're coming your way in the <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/shatteredStar">Shattered Star Adventure Path</a>!</p> 
               <p>So that's it for this week! Two terrible cosmic horrors from the depths of the mythos come to menace your campaigns.</p> 
               <p>I'd say that their incursion into your games counts as both a trick <i>and</i> a treat!</p> 
               <p>Happy Halloween, everyone!</p>

              <p>by Erik Scott de Bie</p> 
              <h2>Chapter Four: The Reward</h2> 
              <div itemprop="articleBody"> 
               <p><span itemprop="description">He awoke in a cold spray of brackish water. The Hellknight who'd roused him drew back the half-empty bucket, then brought it forward again for another go. This time, Tarrant inhaled half the putrid stuff and gagged. "Is that really necessary?" he coughed.</span></p> 
               <p>The Hellknight leaned close, his breath turning Tarrant's stomach. "You stink of fear, Liespinner." </p> 
               <p>"And you stink of mediocrity," Tarrant said. "I prefer my smell, thanks."</p> 
               <p>The knight kicked him in the stomach, and Tarrant collapsed to the floor. The pain was bad, but at least he had earned the freedom to inspect his surroundings. He was still in Hawkthorne Tower—up in the council chambers where Doreset sometimes held formal events. The second Hellknight stood a little ways off, clutching both Tarrant's sheathed rapier and the bottomless red silk bag. Evidence, no doubt. Beyond the Hellknights stood a circle of Blackscale Blades, their expressions grim. </p> 
               <p>Tarrant saw Gislai first, manacled and bruised. Her illusion had fallen, revealing her natural half-orc features. She glared at Tarrant with a mixture of concern and contempt. She had, after all, told him so.</p> 
               <p>Ephere was there as well. She'd shed her fine emerald gown for black working leathers that left her brand uncovered, and she fit in well amongst the Chelaxians. She averted her gaze from Tarrant, like the aloof and serene elf maiden she had first seemed to be. He'd always been a fool for a pretty face.</p> 
               <p>The Hellknight kicked Tarrant again, and Gislai cried out. "Stop it!"</p> 
               <p>Her captor slapped her hard enough to make her stagger into Ephere, who shoved her back with one arm. </p> 
               <p>It wasn't supposed to go this way. Only Tarrant was supposed to suffer for his mistakes, not his friends.</p> 
               <p>The Hellknight drew back his fist for another punch.</p> 
               <p>"Enough." A severe woman with long blonde hair and her own set of fiendish Hellknight armor stepped through the circle of judgment. She clicked the talons of her right-hand gauntlet together and looked down at Tarrant with the sort of expression wolves reserve for wounded deer. "Leave him to me."</p> 
               <p>"Altara," Tarrant said. "Charmed, as always."</p> 
               <p>She kicked at his face with her steel-shod boot, but instinct let him dodge aside enough to save his neck from snapping. The boot crushed his nose and sent him rolling over and over until he slammed into the legs of his Hellknight captor. There he lay coughing as the world spun.</p> 
               <p>Of the many women he'd loved and left in his wake, Altara Hathran had been his first—and consistently worst—oversight. He'd made her promises when they were young together, never dreaming that he would disappoint her, or that his betrayal would lead her to the life of a militant ascetic. He regretted it all bitterly, almost as much as his broken nose. </p> 
               <p>He heard familiar laughter, and turned his woozy focus to a massive man reclining on a divan a few paces away. "Ah, my <i>trusted</i> friend." Lord Doreset's prodigious bulk quivered under his words. "It pleases my heart to see you again, so... helpless."</p> 
               <p>His presence answered all Tarrant's questions. How long had he been in league with the Hellknights? How long had they planned this ambush? It didn't matter.</p> 
               <p>"Your plan has failed," Altara said. "We will find your other friends soon enough—if they haven't fled already."</p> 
               <p>"Aye, that sounds like Eram." </p> 
               <p>"Still a jester." Altara thrust the talons of her gauntlet through Tarrant's mail tunic and into his shoulder, then lifted him to his feet. Tarrant gasped for breath and bloody stars burst at the edges of his vision. She fanned out the sharpened fingers of her other hand on his face and sneered at him. "It's over, Tarrant Liespinner. Your crimes will finally see justice. Have you anything to say for yourself?"</p> 
               <p>"Did—" he muttered. "Did you look... in the bag?"</p> 
               <p>Altara leaned closer. "What?"</p> 
               <div class="blurb360">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Altara.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Altara_360.jpeg" border="0"></a>
                <br> Altara took the breakup badly.
               </div> 
               <p>"I see you... haven't returned the treasure," Tarrant said, getting his breath back. "I expect that's because it's evidence. Have you checked it yet?"</p> 
               <p>"Very well," Altara said. "You wish to have this crime punished now? So be it." She let Tarrant slump to the floor, flicked his blood off her claw, and waved her Hellknight to open the red silk bag. "Should I look for something in particular?"</p> 
               <p>"At the bottom." Tarrant didn't dare sing a song of healing, but surreptitiously pressed his wound to staunch the bleeding. "You wouldn't want to drop any of it, though."</p> 
               <p>Altara reached carefully into the bag, which swallowed up her arm. She drew out handfuls of treasure, but had nowhere to put it. One of the Blackscales came forward with another obviously enchanted haversack, and Altara shoveled handful after handful of jewels and hard coin from the bag into the pack. Lord Doreset chuckled in the background.</p> 
               <p>"This is a mountain of evidence," Altara said. </p> 
               <p>"True," Tarrant said.</p> 
               <p>Finally, Altara reached the bottom of the haul and pulled out a book wrapped in black leather. She peered at it.</p> 
               <p>"Wait," Lord Doreset said, his voice soft. "What is that—?"</p> 
               <p>"More evidence," Tarrant said.</p> 
               <p>Altara unwrapped the twine that held the book shut and flipped through the pages. "Names, dates, amounts," she said. "This is a ledger. And—" She looked at the writing carefully. "This is not your writing, Akayn."</p> 
               <p>"No, it is not," Tarrant said. "My lady."</p> 
               <p>She scrutinized the book anew, with the eye of a judge—which, of course, she was. Whatever grudge Altara might have against Tarrant, she remained an agent of the law. "This is your hand, Lord Doreset," she said. </p> 
               <p>"I've never seen that before!" Lord Doreset huffed.</p> 
               <p>"You mean you haven't seen it <i>recently</i>," Tarrant said. "How could you, when I had stolen it?" he turned back to Altara. "I think you'll find that to be an account of all House Doreset's illegal dealings, from tax evasion to swindling merchants in Cheliax to selling chattel to necromancers in Geb. Also records of embezzlement—oh." He glanced at the assembled soldiers. "Including the thousands of gold sails he embezzled from the Blackscale Blades, while supposedly acting as their patron."</p> 
               <p>A cold murmur passed through the room. Doreset's face went red. "This—this is a trick!" he declared. "A forgery!"</p> 
               <p>"Subject it to whatever tests you want," Tarrant said. "As I fancy you shall."</p> 
               <p>Two burly Blackscale officers moved forward and took Doreset away, no doubt to conduct their own investigation. A third approached Altara and motioned toward the ledger. </p> 
               <p>"See that it's not damaged," she said, and handed it to him. "My knights will be conducting their own investigation as well." The officer nodded in thanks, then left as well, taking the rest of the Blackscales with him.</p> 
               <p>Through it all, Altara watched Tarrant suspiciously. "What was this about?" she asked finally. "You'd do all this—sacrifice your winnings and yourself—just to bury Doreset?"</p> 
               <p>"You uphold justice in your way, I do it in mine." Tarrant coughed raggedly and looked at Altara. "Justice is done, my lady. Would you unbind me, please? Oops." He let the open manacles dangle from one hand. "Looks as though I took care of that. I'll just be going—"</p> 
               <p>"No," Altara said.</p> 
               <p>The Hellknights drew their swords. Tarrant shivered.</p> 
               <p>"Lord Doreset's accounts will be settled," Altara said. "Fear not on that account. But you and I are far from finished." She took hold of his armored shirt and pulled him up to eye level. "What's your plan for dealing with me, Tarrant Liespinner? How are you going to walk out of here?"</p> 
               <p>"Altara, love of my heart." Tarrant gave her a winning smile. "Who said I wanted to leave?" He hummed a sweet melody, which in his mind's eye took the form of floating flower petals around them.</p> 
               <p>Slowly, Altara's expression softened. She was different now—hardened, honed. But underneath the armor, he could still see the lovely young woman he had known in Cheliax. "Oh, Tarrant." Altara loosened her grasp on his tunic.</p> 
               <p>That was all he needed to slip from her clutches and step away. "I'll just be going then."</p> 
               <p>Altara hesitated a second, confused, then her face darkened. She tried to grab for him, but he'd manacled her wrists. "Seize him!" she roared.</p> 
               <p>Her two Hellknights stepped forward, but one jerked spasmodically and toppled to the floor. The other looked around into the flame of a burning fist held up to his face. Ephere stepped protectively between them and Tarrant.</p> 
               <p>"Well done," Tarrant said, putting his arm around her for support.</p> 
               <p>The elf nodded, keeping her fists up.</p> 
               <p>"What treachery is this?" Altara demanded.</p> 
               <p>"A thousand apologies," Tarrant said. "Did you think that night at the Open Palm was our first meeting? Lady Ephere and I are old friends. I can't imagine why you thought otherwise."</p> 
               <p>"What—what of the mark?" Altara pointed her chin at Ephere's chest.</p> 
               <p>"A slave brand," Ephere said. "Tarrant was the one who saved me."</p> 
               <p>"Understandably, she holds little love for Cheliax," Tarrant added.</p> 
               <p>"You were playing us from the beginning!" Altara said.</p> 
               <p>"Indeed." Tarrant looked to Gislai. "Coming?"</p> 
               <p>The half-orc—who looked as shocked as Altara—nodded. She twisted free of her captor and headbutted him in the face. He joined his compatriot on the ground. "You could have told me, you know," she observed.</p> 
               <p>"And spoil the fun? Hardly." Tarrant undid her manacles. "And thank Calistria we're no longer in the vault. Your ring, if you please?" </p> 
               <p>Gislai turned her ring around her finger, and a shimmering light appeared around the three thieves.</p> 
               <p>Still manacled, Altara glared at them. "This is not over, Liespinner."</p> 
               <p>He blew her a kiss. "Love, I would have it no other way."</p> 
               <p align="center">∗∗∗</p> 
               <p> Later, at the Open Palm, Gorm was all smiles as they shared one last drink. Gislai and Ephere were seated nearby, talking of all things elven. Now that all was revealed, they had become fast friends. Tarrant couldn't say whether that boded well or ill. </p> 
               <p>"Really?" Gorm asked. "They just took Lord Doreset away like that?"</p> 
               <p>"As I expected. Perhaps the proper authorities will even get to lock him up afterward. If there's anything left." Tarrant winced as he dabbed a damp cloth at his nose. Gislai's prayers had healed it, but it still felt uneven. "That squares your debt, then?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, but you—" Gorm shook his head. "You've given much for me: almost got thrown into prison again or worse, lost your magic bag and any reward, and only brought the Hellknights down on you all the harder. You'll have to leave Absalom. Come to think of it, why haven't you left yet? I'm glad to drink with you, but—"</p> 
               <p>Tarrant shrugged, unconcerned. "I hear Korvosa is nice this time of year—and that its women are fiery. Besides, who spoke of loss?"</p> 
               <p>At that moment, two Blackscales entered. Ephere raised her gauntlets and Gislai pulled out several shuriken, but the adventurers' forms shimmered as the magic of their potions wore off. Eram and Arlif looked none the worse for wear. The halfling walked sullenly to Tarrant's side. </p> 
               <p>"You might have trusted me," Eram said. "And not sent this mute giant with me."</p> 
               <p>"And you might have fled town." Tarrant took the haversack from Eram. "Fled before splitting shares, that is."</p> 
               <p>He opened the bag to reveal gleaming treasure: their haul from the bait and switch.</p> 
               <p>"Now it's time to go," Tarrant said. "The road beckons, and greater villainy awaits."</p>

You will notice that these two druids do not have animal companions, but there is an appendix in the back of the book with animal companions of every level.

               <p>Pathfinder Society Organized Play is a social, roleplaying game where people come together in public to enjoy our favorite pastime. Pathfinder Society is built upon this community. Even if you only play with friends at home, this group is your local gaming community. </p> 
               <p>In Georgia, I realized very quickly I couldn’t run Pathfinder Society on my own, especially if I wanted the community to grow it and make it better. With a large area spread out across the Atlanta metro area, I simply couldn’t make it to all the stores, meet all the players and store owners, recruit the GMs needed, and grow Pathfinder Society to the numbers I’d set as goals. This led me to being able to find a core group of store liaisons (today we call them Venture-Lieutenants) to help the community grow Pathfinder Society. Without the tireless efforts of Kyle and Nani Pratt, Joseph Caubo, Nicholas Gray, and John Compton, the community in Georgia wouldn’t be as strong as it is today. The first thing we did was work to get a website in place so that all interested gamers had a place to gather and plan future game days, chat about Pathfinder Society in general, and brag about their accomplishments. In hindsight, this was the foundation of building a strong community. </p> 
               <p>I was going to expand on how my Venture-Lieutenants’ contributions helped and were the foundation of one of the strongest player bases in the world, but that would take many more words. Instead, I am going to invite them to come here and share those experiences. They will do a much better job explaining their parts than I ever could. I will instead leave it at a simple thank you. Without all of their tireless efforts, we wouldn’t have a community in Georgia; we would just have many splintered groups of gamers.</p> 
               <p>This blog post is an introduction to a topic that I will be including in a future version of the <a href="/products/btpy84k4"><i>Pathfinder Society Guide to Organized Play</i></a>, under the heading of 'The Pathfinder Society Community':</p> 
               <blockquote>
                <p><i>"The Pathfinder Society Organized Play Campaign is a global gaming community that exists because of the efforts of volunteers just like you. In joining the Pathfinder Society Community, your contributions—whether GMing, aiding in organizing events, helping new players, or just sharing your enthusiasm—are an essential part of Pathfinder Society membership. You are strongly encouraged to add your efforts to make this campaign better. It cannot exist without you and together we can do great things."</i></p>
               </blockquote> 
               <p>Our gaming communities would not continue to exist without your contributions, which is why we are adding this to the <i>Guide</i>—to highlight how vitally important it is that everyone gives back to his or her local Pathfinder Society gaming community. Let me add, we at Paizo do not have any expectations about how you give back; we only request that you do so. Your local Pathfinder Society community might already have some ideas about what being a member entails.</p> 
               <p>Many of the challenges that Pathfinder Society communities face, such as a lack of GMs, can only be solved by the community members, and the successes that happen are a result of many people working together toward a common goal. You matter. Your ideas matter. Your contributions matter. Together we make things happen.</p> 
               <p>Let’s look at common ways to contribute to your Pathfinder Society community. This is in no way an exhaustive list. It is simply a list of common ways to give back:</p>
               <ul> 
                <li><b>Offer to GM.</b> This one is first on the list because it is obviously the easiest and most important. There is a reason why we stress GMing so much. It’s a great way to give back to the community <i>and</i> become a better player while you do it. We have established GM 101 training sessions to encourage quality GMing and we hope that all of you will try spending some time behind the screen.</li> 
                <li><b>Organize gamedays and local conventions.</b> Anyone can organize a gameday or small convention, not just Venture Captains and Lieutenants. All you need is to arrange the gaming space, secure the GMs, promote the event to get players, and then report it. It’s easy and provides a valuable service. You can become a local coordinator by coordinating a regular event, such as at a game store or even at home. Setting up new spaces on a regular basis provides new locations for players to play, and for new potential players to experience the community that Pathfinder Society offers and creates.</li> 
                <li><p><b>Help find and prepare new players for Pathfinder Society Organized Play. </b>New players are the lifeblood of the Society. This very important as we will always have some attrition in the ranks. Spreading your enthusiasm by finding and teaching new Pathfinders what it means to be in the Society and helping promote your local events are of vital importance. If all you do is introduce one new player a month to the Society and your local playgroup, your Pathfinder Society community will grow stronger, and perhaps even become one of the most vibrant in the world.</p> <p>You might be surprised who could be interested in Pathfinder Society. It’s the perfect vehicle for people who have busy working and home lives, and who can’t commit to a regular schedule, to still get their gaming fix. Talk openly and honestly about Pathfinder Society to people you come across, even if you don’t think they fit the typical bill of a gamer. </p> <p>Some additional reading can be found in Painlord’s post <a href="http://paizo.com/forums/dmtz47j7">here.</a></p></li> 
                <li><b>Other ways to contribute.</b> The Pathfinder Society runs best when the environment is friendly and warm and people are recognized for their time and efforts. If you’re the person who is always bringing pizza and sodas to thank GMs, taking the time to help the local coordinator design flyers, offering to do the reporting after the events, or printing materials for your local group, you are doing your part. There are many ways to contribute.</li>
               </ul>
               <p></p> 
               <p>I believe that our Society will be stronger as more and more of us give back to the Society. I have seen it happen in Georgia... the more voices we had, the better we were together. </p> 
               <p>This is important to me and our Society... and that’s why we are adding it to the <i>Guide</i>. </p> 
               <p>On a final note, tell us how you contribute, or plan to contribute, in your area’s lodge during Season 4. The more ideas we have to show people, the better off Pathfinder Society will be as a whole.</p> 
               <p>If this blog receives enough positive feedback, I think it could lead to a series of monthly blogs, each one getting into the details of the bullet points above or other similar topics. Let me know what you think and I look forward to reading your suggestions on building a better Pathfinder Society community.</p> 
               <p>I want to thank Eric Brittain (Venture Captain of San Diego), Nani Pratt (Co-Venture Captain of Atlanta), Joshua Archer (Venture Lieutenant of San Francisco), Jeff Kokx (aka Drogon), and Kyle Baird (as himself). Their feedback and help with this blog allowed me to get the above thoughts and message out and were invaluable in this week’s Pathfinder Society blog post. </p>

              <div itemprop="articleBody"> 
               <p>The Halloween season is about more than just scares. Here in Seattle, the approach of Halloween means the end of nice weather and a months-long descent into "the gray," a series of cloudy, rainy, dreary days often strung together 40 or 50 at a time. It's not the dreariness that gets you, or the dampness. It's the monotony of it all. The same day, every day, for days and days and days and days (can you tell I just got back from a vacation?). But Halloween is around the corner to break up the gloom, and it does so with both tricks AND treats.</p> 
               <p><span itemprop="description">This week, I'm focusing on a couple of the "treats" in the upcoming <a href="/products/btpy8v0b">Shattered Star</a> set of Pathfinder Battles prepainted miniatures due to hit stores and subscribers in January. And since it's gray outside, I thought I'd stick to a "gray" theme.</span></p> 
               <p>Specifically, I'm talking about the Gray Maidens.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20121019-GreyMaiden.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20121019-GreyMaiden_180.jpeg" border="0"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>The Gray Maidens first appeared during the <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/curseOfTheCrimsonThrone">Curse of the Crimson Throne Adventure Path</a>, our second-ever Pathfinder campaign. Stationed in the Varisian city of Korvosa, the Gray Maidens were the personal bodyguard of Queen Ileosa, and became heavily embroiled in the chaos and machinations that fueled that campaign.</p> 
               <p>When the <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/shatteredStar">Shattered Star Adventure Path</a> set out to revisit Varisia, we knew we wanted to include the Gray Maidens from the start. We liked their design enough that we put it on the back cover of the <a href="/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj"><i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i></a>, after all, so it was only a matter of time before we'd revisit them in an Adventure Path.</p> 
               <p>And make prepainted miniatures of them, of course.</p> 
               <p>The figure pictured above is the rank-and-file Gray Maiden. She works perfectly in concert with the Shattered Star or Curse of the Crimson Throne campaigns, and we've put her at the uncommon rarity so it's relatively easy to build up a bunch of them. Not playing either of those Pathfinder Adventure Paths? Not to worry, this figure is cool enough to work for any female warrior in full plate, including a player character.</p> 
               <p>Speaking of character, we've had good luck so far including multiple types of the same "troop" in previous Pathfinder Battles sets, and the <a href="/products/btpy8v0b">Shattered Star</a> set is no exception. A squad of Gray Maidens needs leadership, so the set also includes the Gray Maiden Commander.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20121019-Commander.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20121019-Commander_180.jpeg" border="0"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Pictured above is Oriana, leader of the Gray Maiden contingent encountered in the second Shattered Star adventure, <a href="/products/btpy8tmi">"Curse of the Lady's Light"</a>. She's got some nasty scars on her face and a real chip on her shoulder, and your player characters are going to love hating her.</p> 
               <p>And what better way to focus that hate than a gorgeous prepainted figure placed right in the middle of your gaming table?</p> 
               <p>The Gray Maidens are coming your way in January, complete with the rest of the <a href="/products/btpy8v0b">Shattered Star</a> set. We're thrilled with the way these figures came out, and I continue to be extremely excited about the level of quality WizKids has put into this set.</p> 
               <p>But I've got days and days of gray Seattle skies ahead of me, and things are bound to get a bit gloomier between now and Halloween.</p> 
               <p>In fact, I think the horror around here is about to get downright <i>cosmic</i>.</p> 
               <p>Return here in seven days for unknowable horrors from the edge of the cosmos that man was never meant to experience (but which will look GREAT on your gaming table!).</p> 
               <p>Trick or treat!</p>

We've shown some <a href="/paizo/blog/2012/july/v5748dyo5ldn1&amp;page=2?Paizo-announces-Paizo-Game-Space#84">screenshots</a>, and clarified <a href="/paizo/blog/2012/july/v5748dyo5ldn1&amp;page=4?Paizo-announces-Paizo-Game-Space#180">why we're doing this</a> (hint: it's <a href="/paizo/blog/2012/july/v5748dyo5ldn1&amp;page=4?Paizo-announces-Paizo-Game-Space#186">not to crush our enemies</a>). But now it's been a few months, and the VTT isn't available yet, so we'd like to give you an update on where we are and answer some big questions: "When can I use it?" and "How much will it cost?"</span></p> 
               <p><b>When can I use it? </b></p> 
               <p>We're going to be starting public beta testing in the next few weeks. This beta test will be open to anybody who bought a ticket online for PaizoCon 2012. This gives us a reasonably limited group of people to bang on it and break the obvious stuff so we can fix it before opening it up to everybody. Ideally, the beta test will last just a few weeks, but that will depend on what breaks.</p> 
               <p><b>How much will it cost?</b></p> 
               <p>As we've said before, it'll be free to play. But we'll have ways for you to give us money. Since we're talking about selling access to digital data, pretty much anything is possible, but initially, we're focusing on maps, tokens and adventures. </p> 
               <p>We've also settled on some basic principles:</p> 
               <ul>
                <li><b>If you buy it, you keep it.</b> That means no limited number of uses, no monthly fees, no pay-per-play, no rentals. If you buy a token set for Paizo Game Space, you can use those tokens whenever you like. Period. There's no extra charge to use the same token in multiple games. You won't have to pay us again next year to keep using it. And if you buy a campaign and want to run multiple groups through it, you can do that, too.</li> 
                <li><b>If someone at the table has it, everybody can see it.</b> Rather than make GMs have to purchase <i>everything</i>, we think it's important for players to be able to help out. So if Karzoug is running a campaign, and needs Flip-Mat: Country Inn, Merisiel can just let him use hers.*</li>
               </ul> 
               <p>So how much does that Flip-Mat cost Merisiel? We're still working out pricing for things like Adventure Paths and token packs, but we can tell you this: Flip-Mats and Map Packs will be just $1.99. And if you already bought the PDF for a Flip-Mat or Map Pack? You can use it in Paizo Game Space, free.</p>

               <p>It was time to begin.</p> 
               <p>With all the activity around the front gate, where the Blackscale Blades were delivering the great treasure, the servants' entrance stood only lightly guarded. Two armored men flanked the back door, one of whom wore the key around his neck as a badge of office. Tarrant was familiar with Lord Doreset's favored mercenary company and knew their procedures.</p> 
               <p>Tarrant swaggered out of the alley. A thick brown cloak dipped in low-class swill covered his identity. As he approached, Tarrant sang a dwarven song in a low-pitched, slurred voice, crafting bubbles that floated through the air toward the man with the key.</p> 
               <p>"Shove off, you!" shouted the other guard. "Go be drunk on your own—Drohn?"</p> 
               <p>The guard's partner smiled like a child and plucked at the bubbles of song that floated around him. When he saw Tarrant, his smile widened, and he stared.</p> 
               <p>"Magic!" hissed the first guard. He reached for his sword, but a different spell caught him before he could draw. He blinked, swayed on his feet, and looked confused. He pointed his sword at Tarrant half-heartedly.</p> 
               <p>Gislai appeared. "Your need for attention is your least likeable characteristic."</p> 
               <p>"I make up for it in other ways," Tarrant sang, and resumed his song with a chorus to keep the beguiled guard interested.</p> 
               <p>The priestess rolled her eyes and chanted a second spell. Her half-orc visage wavered and changed into that of Captain Nemerath, an authoritative human Blackscale captain of Tarrant's acquaintance and occasional liaison. The guard captain's armor—unfastened slightly for appearances—made a perfect disguise for Gislai. "You seem troubled, soldier. What's your name?"</p> 
               <p>The guard looked relieved to see her. "I'm Rholf, captain."</p> 
               <p>"A good strong Ulfen name," she said. "Named for your father, were you?"</p> 
               <p>He nodded, then turned his attention back to Tarrant. "This one... is he yours?"</p> 
               <p>Tarrant recognized Gislai's little mischievous smile all too well—she was considering betraying him. He kept singing, and Drohn sat down so that he could listen better.</p> 
               <p>Finally, Gislai nodded. "He is a friend. We've come to check the locks on the gate."</p> 
               <p>"Locks." Rholf looked at the strong iron lock on the door. "Drohn has the key, but—" His expression grew suspicious. "But I can't just give—"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, we don't need the key," Gislai said. "That wouldn't be much of a test, would it? My associate is suitably skilled. He'll test the lock."</p> 
               <p>Eram Many-Fingers appeared from the shadows, his eyes darting back and forth nervously. He stepped up to the gate and slipped his lockpicks out of his belt. Meanwhile, Gislai took Rholf aside. Every one of her words, smiles, and seemingly unintentionally touches strengthened the spell. It really was a wonder to watch such a natural con artist at work.</p> 
               <p>With Rholf suitably distracted, Tarrant nodded—the signal for Eram to make his move. He didn't even touch his picks to the door, which would have triggered the warding magic anyway. Instead, he crept up on the distracted Drohn and took his chain of office—along with the key—right off his neck.</p> 
               <p>Tarrant wove a new thread of the song, suggesting Drohn shuffle off to the nearest alehouse. When Drohn had wandered out of sight, Tarrant let the song trail away. "Gislai."</p> 
               <p>The half-orc cast him an annoyed look, then shared a few more words with Rholf. The guard nodded and left. "He'll go back to guarding the gate—once he finds Drohn, wherever the man got off to."</p> 
               <p>Tarrant nodded. "Your spell is very effective."</p> 
               <div class="blurb360">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Gislai.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Gislai_360.jpeg" border="0"></a>
                <br> Gislai is more than just a pretty face.
               </div> 
               <p>"Aye, for one guard. And now it's expended. What happens when we face a group?"</p> 
               <p>"No worries," Tarrant said, patting the satchel at his hip. "I've a plan for that, too."</p> 
               <p>At his signal, Arlif and Ephere emerged from the alley, both clad in thick cloaks. They crossed to the door and entered. The elf gave Tarrant a brief nod that made him smile.</p> 
               <p>"That, right there?" Gislai pointed to the elf. "That's dangerous."</p> 
               <p>"Whence this dislike for our companion, 'captain'?" Tarrant shed his filthy cloak to reveal a Blackscale's trademark mail beneath. He sang a brief song of disguise and took the shape of Rholf. "Is not your Calistria an elven goddess?"</p> 
               <p>"That just means I know how treacherous elves are," Gislai countered.</p> 
               <p>"And beautiful."</p> 
               <p>"As I said."</p> 
               <p>They stepped through the door into the inner guardroom and found the others in a tense standoff with three more Blackscales—two humans and a dwarf. Axe in hand, Arlif stood between them and Ephere. Eram was nowhere to be seen, the coward. Blades slid from sheathes.</p> 
               <p>The Liespinner hadn't earned his name by hesitating. "Down arms! A thousand apologies, my lady ambassador!"</p> 
               <p>The Blackscales looked confused. "Ambassador?" the dwarf rumbled.</p> 
               <p>On cue, Ephere threw back her cloak, revealing a gorgeous gown of green silk, lined with silver stitching. Tarrant had acquired this dress in one of Absalom's most fashionable boutiques.</p> 
               <p>"Ambassador Saleae Epheldera of Kyonin," Tarrant said. "Here to inspect the ancient elven treasures recovered during the recent expedition."</p> 
               <p>The dwarf, presumably the commanding officer, shook his head. "We were not informed."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, well, the honorable Viridian Crown has heard of our recent exploits, and..."</p> 
               <p>"I am an expert on the artifacts of Kyonin." Ephere held up her ensorcelled gauntlets, which crackled with magical power. "My kinswoman, Queen Telandia, knows of this dragon you slew—an old beast with an even older hoard. She will pay handsomely for relics that predate our people's return from Sovyrian. But this—" Ephere drew up to her full height. "This is not how I am accustomed to being treated. First drunken guards, and now insolence? This is an insult to me and to the queen."</p> 
               <p>Confronted with an offended noble promising a reward, the Blackscales quickly put their blades away and offered apologies. Ephere's natural affinity for deception touched Tarrant's villainous heart.</p> 
               <p>"Someone under my command mucked this up," Gislai said. "I'll bet it's that damned Drohn—always drinking on the job. Where's your good-for-nothing partner, Rholf?"</p> 
               <p>"Apologies, Captain," Tarrant said to her. "It won't happen again."</p> 
               <p>"See that it doesn't." Gislai looked to the Blackscales. "Stand easy, gentlemen. You're not at fault here."</p> 
               <p>At first, it seemed the guards might press for more answers, but ultimately they relaxed. At a nod from Gislai, they sat back down to a half-finished hand of Towers.</p> 
               <p>Tarrant and his party pressed through the cloakroom and closed the doors behind them. It disappointed him that the guards hadn't asked why such a noble visitor would enter through the servants' door. He'd had a lie all prepared for that—"a matter of diplomatic delicacy." Shame, but an unused lie was an unspent arrow.</p> 
               <p>Perhaps, he thought, they didn't care. Perhaps they recognize a robbery in progress and had just given Tarrant their tacit approval to take Lord Doreset for all he was worth. He liked to think they had.</p> 
               <p>Eram appeared from around the corner, rubbing his hands together and glancing back at the site of the near-disaster. "Finally, you return," Tarrant said. "No troubles?"</p> 
               <p>"None," the halfling murmured.</p> 
               <p>"Are you well?" Gislai asked, narrowing her eyes in suspicion. "You seem even more twitchy than usual."</p> 
               <p>"No, not at all!" the halfling protested. "I'm fine! Just fine!"</p> 
               <p>"If I didn't know better, I'd think you were planning something."</p> 
               <p>"Only the plan!" Eram said. "Promise!"</p> 
               <p>"I'm sure it's fine." Tarrant turned to the others. "That was exciting, wasn't it?" He touched Ephere's arm. "You did well."</p> 
               <p>The elf nodded. Behind her, Gislai groaned.</p> 
               <p>"You noted them well, I hope?" Tarrant slipped vials of blue potion to Arlif and Eram. "In case anything else goes wrong."</p> 
               <p>"What is this?" Eram asked. "Escape in a bottle?"</p> 
               <p>"Something of the sort," Tarrant said. "Let's move on, shall we?"</p> 
               <p>They stepped past the entry chamber into a larger hall where the walls pulsed with warding magic. Torches burst into life at their approach, revealing a solid vault door at the end of the hall. Tarrant felt the oppressive warding magic all around him, like an invisible wall of water. "Beyond here, anything we bring from the vault will no doubt trigger—"</p> 
               <p>Eram took a step deeper into the hall, and the wards whined to angry life. Two hulking iron statues shivered, pulled away from the walls, and pointed massive swords at them.</p> 
               <p>"—Guardians." Tarrant took Drohn's chain of office from Eram and presented it to the guardians. "Hold!"</p> 
               <p>The golems stepped closer, oblivious to his command.</p> 
               <p>"Stop?" Tarrant tried. "Desist?"</p> 
               <p>The golems raised their swords, and the would-be thieves reached for their weapons. Ephere's arms lit with fire and lightning. Eram slipped two daggers into his hands and Arlif unbuckled his greataxe. Tarrant wondered if his music would touch such creatures. He doubted it.</p> 
               <p>Then Gislai—still in disguise as Captain Nemerath—stepped forward, seized the chain from Tarrant, and raised it to the golems. "Zarahtas!" she declaimed.</p> 
               <p>Instantly, the guardians lowered their swords and returned to their places.</p> 
               <p>"Good thing I bothered to get the passphrase from Rholf," she said as they crossed through the hall. "For security, one guard had the chain, one had the code. Apparently, Doreset had the golems changed after he had you thrown in prison."</p> 
               <p>"Outstanding." Tarrant strode past the resting golems and sized up the doors. "You know, these doors were specially built in Nex with the finest magic coin can purchase. They have no ward that needs to be renewed daily, but rather several persistent enchantments imbedded in the doors themselves. It would take several wizards multiple castings to suppress them, and by that point, the alarm spells would sound. Damned impressive, not to mention expensive." Tarrant beckoned to Eram. "Rod please."</p> 
               <p>"What?" the halfling said.</p> 
               <p>"Why do you think I asked you about the job in Cassomir? I know you're carrying the rod, so just give it here."</p> 
               <p>The halfling grumbled, but sure enough, reached into his haversack. His arm extended all the way into one of the small pockets, and he pulled out a foot-long silvery rod. "Be welcome to the cursed thing anyway."</p> 
               <p>"I sense a story there, no?" Gislai said.</p> 
               <p>Eram shook his head frantically.</p> 
               <p>Tarrant took the rod, which hummed slightly in his hand, and held it in front of the door. "Arlif, Eram, this is as far as you go—Gislai, you too."</p> 
               <p>"That wasn't the plan!" the half-orc protested. "I'm certainly not leaving you with her."</p> 
               <p>Ephere seemed unconcerned.</p> 
               <p>"As long as she's at your side," Gislai said, "I'm at the other."</p> 
               <p>"I never object to working between two lovely ladies." Tarrant smiled. "I'll have that potion back, then. It's important you not have it."</p> 
               <p>Gislai looked perplexed, but ultimately she rolled her eyes and handed the vial back.</p> 
               <p>"Outstanding." He tucked it into his tunic. "Arlif, Eram—time to part ways."</p> 
               <p>The big Ulfen warrior turned and made his way back across the golem-guarded hall, and Eram—after a longing look at the vault door—joined him. Gislai stood her ground stubbornly.</p> 
               <p>"I didn't realize you cared," Tarrant said. "I'm touched."</p> 
               <p>"Touched in the head, if you think I'm letting you in there alone," she said. "What's to keep you from taking your fill of gold and leaving nothing for us?"</p> 
               <p>"Prudent." Tarrant tapped the rod against the door, setting off a series of pops and crackles as its antimagic cancelled out the door's many enchantments. The magic left its mechanical locks in place, however.</p> 
               <p>He began a song the elves of Kyonin used to welcome ships from distant lands, which his mother had first heard from traveling musicians. It had always been one of his favorite ballads as a boy, and now as a man, it provided focus to his magic. Soft green light swirled around him. At the climax of the spell, he reached out and knocked once on the massive vault door.</p> 
               <p>Nothing happened.</p> 
               <p>"Huh."</p> 
               <p>He cast the spell and knocked again, but still, the doors remained sealed.</p> 
               <p>"How terribly embarrassing."</p> 
               <p>Tarrant began the song a third time, but Ephere laid her hand on his arm. From beneath the folds of her gown, she drew a hollow mithral tube about twice the length of her slender hand.</p> 
               <p>"Is that what I think it is?" Gislai asked. "Well isn't that convenient. And suspicious."</p> 
               <p>"Nonsense! Thank you, Ephere." Tarrant handed her his rapier. "Have a care with this."</p> 
               <p>Ephere tapped the rapier's pommel against the tube, which resonated with a deep, clear tone. The locks on the now mundane door clicked, and the vault opened to them, shedding golden light that bathed their skin.</p> 
               <p>Gislai sucked in a sharp breath.</p> 
               <p>Ephere nodded.</p> 
               <p>"Outstanding," Tarrant said.</p> 
               <p>The sheer size of the hoard stunned them to silence. A kingdom's ransom in coins and jewels overflowed from open chests. Cut gems the size of a clenched fist lay carefully arranged atop bolts of fine silk and damask. Ancient swords and shields adorned marble statues inlaid with silver and jewels. The most impressive piece was, by far, a statue of a dragon, wrought of pure gold and studded with rubies the length of its tail.</p> 
               <p>"To work." Tarrant pulled a red silk bag from his tunic, into which he began shoveling treasure. However much they put in, the bag never seemed to swell.</p> 
               <p>"Avoid the relics—tricky to fence," Gislai said. "Hard coin and jewels spend better."</p> 
               <p>"Good thing Eram stayed away," Tarrant said. "He'd likely die of a burst head."</p> 
               <p>"I might do so myself." Gislai held up a platinum tiara. "Look at this! A lass could get used to—"</p> 
               <p>Then a keening wail filled the room, roaring out into the tower: an alarm spell. Tarrant turned to see Ephere pointing her war gauntlets at them. He reached for his sword, only to remember that the elf had taken it at the door. He winced.</p> 
               <p>"Don't move," she said. "Lady Altara will be here soon."</p> 
               <p>"I told you not to trust her," Gislai murmured.</p> 
               <p>"That's really comforting," Tarrant said. "Why, dear lady? Have I offended you? Why would you side with those poorly appointed Hellknights over us?"</p> 
               <p>Ephere reached down and pulled her bodice open just enough to reveal a long-faded scar, like a brand. There, she traced the forefinger of her right hand across her flesh, lighting a burning star to mark herself. That was why she'd been keen to hide her skin earlier, and why that spot on her chest had felt hot under his touch. It was a symbol Tarrant recognized all too well.</p> 
               <p>"Hail Asmodeus." She pressed her lightning gauntlet to Tarrant's head and shocked him into darkness.</p>

               <p>For the past year and a half I've been working hard to make these lines as fun and useful as possible. I've worked to make many of our Map Packs more modular, so that you, the GM, can build the kind of complexes and adventure sites that dance around your imagination. I've also been working to create synergies (excuse my use of such an overused and often misused term) among these products whenever possible.</p> 
               <p>For example, if you have both <a href="/products/btpy8sa1"><i>Map Pack: Marketplace</i></a> and <a href="/products/btpy8ssg"><i>Map Pack: Rooftops</i></a>, you'll notice that you can use them to create large and evocative city spaces. I like running urban adventures, and I'm a sucker for mapping aids that will help me illustrate the twisting alleyways that serve as the stage for a chase, gang war, or a run-in with local bravos with more guts than brains. When we put these products on the schedule I wanted to create the product that I always wanted, and that I figured a lot of you would want too.</p> 
               <p>But there are other types of synergies within current mapping products. Lately we have worked to have some of our maps fit well with some of our Adventure Paths. The latest ship maps provide the layout for the chief vessels the PCs command in the Skull &amp; Shackles Adventure Path, and <a href="/products/btpy8s9x"><i>Flip-Mat: Town Square</i></a> provides two chief encounter locations within the town of Sandpoint for those of you running Rise of the Runelords. The goal of this type of synergy is to give a tool to GMs who are running Adventure Paths, without making the maps so specific that they're hard to use for those GMs who aren't.</p> 
               <p>The question I pose to you all on this fine autumn Tuesday is, "Are we on the right track?" Do you like the synergies in the mapping products? Have you noticed them? Are we going far enough? Let me know your mind on this matter and help me to create the best products for your Pathfinder game.</p>

               <p><span itemprop="description">We launched the Year of the Risen Rune at Gen Con in August and are moving quickly into the heart of the season's metaplots with the release of two new scenarios this month. In past seasons, we've moved from completely unlinked scenarios to short three- or four-part story arcs within a larger array of generally unlinked scenarios and then further into seasonal meta-arcs covering an entire year's worth of scenarios. During Seasons 2 and 3, the Year of the Shadow Lodge and Year of the Ruby Phoenix, respectively, we still released several multipart stories within the larger arcs, each with its own series title. We're not doing that this year, though, not because we think there's necessarily a problem with multipart scenarios, but rather because we wanted to try something else out.</span></p> 
               <p>Multipart scenarios have always been big hits for players, who like the continuity between adventures, as well as for event organizers who can schedule a whole arc for a gameday or convention to give a bit more cohesion to their event. But for everyone who has given positive feedback about multipart scenarios there's been another Pathfinder Society member who's expressed frustration with needing to play them in order, leveling out of a series' tier, or release of scenarios being delayed by a month (or more, in some cases).</p> 
               <p>In response to this, we've set the multipart arc format to the side this season and are trying something new—a high-level and a low-level metaplot tied directly to the season's larger metaplot. These adventures will build upon one another in a way more like a traditional campaign but in a way that they can be played out of order or by different PCs without their internal continuity suffering. But for someone playing them in order and with the same character, a clear through-line and progression from the arc's start to finish will become apparent. In both cases, the adventure that kicks off the metaplot will be releasing this month!</p> 
               <p>Pathfinders of 1st to 7th levels are going to be doing a lot of scenarios dealing with the Aspis Consortium and firmly establishing the Pathfinder Society as a prominent Varisian organization despite the Consortium's longer presence in the region. This metaplot begins with <a href="/products/btpy8u8t"><i>Pathfinder Society Scenario #4-07: Severing Ties</i></a>, and will conclude in June in a Tier 3-7 scenario we're tentatively calling <i>Rivalry's End</i>. This metaplot is set to bring at least two villains back from previous seasons, though who they are and what roles they're set to play I'm not yet ready to reveal.</p> 
               <div class="blurb180">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PZOPSS0408-Tomaz.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PZOPSS0408-Tomaz_180.jpeg" border="0"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Players with characters in the highest tier of regular Pathfinder Society play will note that every Tier 7-11 scenario released from this month to the end of the season has direct ties to the cult of Lissala, an ancient Thassilonian faith thought lost to time. Over the course of the season, the Pathfinder Society's highest-level field operatives will be sent to investigate the cult, uncover what they're up to, and ultimately face the greatest threat to ever appear in a Pathfinder Society Scenario. We're planting seeds of the final showdown in some of our earliest scenarios of the year, and players who earn special unique rewards will have the chance to use them to make an otherwise epic encounter in July's Tier 7-11 season finale (currently titled <i>The Waking Rune</i>) perhaps a bit more survivable.</p> 
               <p>What about those PCs who like to adventure in the middle, like Tier 5-9? Well, that's sort of our catchall this season while we put more thematic scenarios into Tiers 1-5, 3-7, and 7-11 and their respective metaplots. Mid-level Pathfinders will get to follow up on a low-level party's discoveries by venturing into a Hellknight citadel, will have the chance to alter the very nature of the <i>Hao Jin Tapestry</i>, and in May, June, and July, take the Pathfinder Society from Varisia into a neighboring nation and from there into Season 5 with an epic discovery!</p> 
               <p>As the season plays out and folks get a chance to play through these metaplots, please leave your feedback here or on the Pathfinder Society messageboards. Whether you've got a 1st-level neophyte Pathfinder or a seasoned veteran coming up on 10th level, don't miss this month's release of <a href="/products/btpy8u8t"><i>Pathfinder Society Scenario #4-07: Severing Ties</i></a> and <a href="/products/btpy8u8u"><i>Pathfinder Society Scenario #4-08: The Cultist's Kiss</i></a>!

               <p><b>First, let me tell you a bit about the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game.</b></p> 
               <p>The Pathfinder Adventure Card Game is a cooperative game for 1 to 6 players designed by Mike Selinker and his team at Lone Shark Games, which Paizo intends to release at Gen Con 2013 (if not PaizoCon 2013).</p> 
               <p>Each player has a unique character comprised of a deck of cards and a set of stats. Roleplayers will find the stats very familiar—characters have classes such as fighter, wizard, and rogue; they have numbers that define their Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, etc.; they have skills and proficiencies.</p> 
               <p>As your player adventures, you'll improve your deck by acquiring new items, allies, spells, and weapons as you explore and overcome challenges; over time, you'll be customizing your deck to suit your own individual vision of your character.</p> 
               <div class="blurb120">
                <a href="/products/btpy8tc0"><img src="/image/product/catalog/PZO/PZO1002_120.jpeg" border="0"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>The Pathfinder Adventure Card Game product offerings will begin with the Rise of the Runelords Base Set, a big box containing more than 400 cards including the "Burnt Offerings" Adventure Deck. Your party will explore locations such as the Sandpoint Cathedral, the Rusty Dragon, and the Glassworks; you'll meet helpful NPCs like Ameiko Kaijitsu or friendly Aldern Foxglove; you'll visit the Swallowtail Festival, delve into the Catacombs of Wrath, and invade Thistletop. You'll fight goblins, sinspawn, Warchief Ripnugget, and maybe even face the Sandpoint devil, and eventually, become the heroes of Sandpoint! The Base Set supports 1 to 4 players; a 110-card add-on deck will expand the number of players to 5 or 6, as well as adding more character options for any number of players.</p> 
               <p>We'll follow the Base Set with bimonthly 110-card Adventure Decks presenting the subsequent five chapters of Rise of the Runelords and, if all goes well, we'll adapt other Adventure Paths after that!</p> 
               <p>The Pathfinder Adventure Game plays in an hour to an hour-and-a-half; it's easy to learn, yet offers a lot of variety in play. Mike Selinker and his team did a stunning job capturing the feel of the Pathfinder Roleplaying game, the Pathfinder campaign setting, and the Rise of the Runelords Adventure Path in a fun card game.</p> 
               <p>But to make this game is as fun and exciting as possible we're going to need playtesters—lots of playtesters. If you're interested in being one of them, <a href="/forums/dmtz6nal">find out how on our messageboards</a>!</p>

               <p>So, on to the spoooooooookiness!</p> 
               <p>First up this week we have an absolutely disgusting menace culled from the mind of Paizo's own James L. Sutter. A while back, when James was writing the brilliant <a href="/products/btpy8fda"><i>City of Strangers: A Guide to Kaer Maga</i></a>, James invented an ancient subterranean race of outsiders known as the caulborn who dwell below Varisia's most unusual city. These telepathic prophets and historians feed on the psychic energy and memories of victims, which they keep in their grossly distended heads.</p> 
               <p>The third adventure of the <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/shatteredStar">Shattered Star Adventure Path</a>, <a href="/products/btpy8v2r"><i>The Asylum Stone</i></a>, written by Mr. Sutter himself, returns to Kaer Maga, so of course the caulborn make a return appearance. And in my endless quest to ply my editorial staff with 3D representations of the fruit of their own diseased minds (and 'cause you fight 'em in the adventure), I just had to add one of them to the Shattered Star set.</p> 
               <p>Here he is, a gross miniature in this grossest of months: The Caulborn!</p>

               <p>Sculpted in clear plastic, from the jet of ectoplasm holding up his head to the multicolored gems encrusting it, this guy is one of the major villains of the campaign, and one your player characters won't soon forget. Mesmalatu is among the smallest miniatures in the <a href="/products/btpy8v0b">Shattered Star</a> set, but he's also no doubt one of the most powerful enemies we've sculpted in plastic to date.</p> 
               <p>And that's it for today! Here's hoping I scared the socks off of you (or at least impressed you a bit with two awesome miniatures).</p> 
               <p>And with that, I slip cannily back to my vacation, to return with a big pile of treats for next Friday's blog!</p>

               <p><span itemprop="description">Wails regularly echo through the eastern wing of Gravecharge, Pharasma's cathedral in the university city of Lepidstadt. Yet such aren't the breathless screams of the dead that so often ring through the corners of Ustalav, but rather the cries of life. Since its construction, Gravecharge has maintained a clean and well-supervised hospice for sick and orphaned youths. Just as the goddess Pharasma concerns herself with the transition of life to death, so does she cherish even the most tragic lives.</span></p> 
               <p>Imrijka came to Gravecharge in the arms of a city watchman, wrapped in a tattered uniform and held at arm's length. The guard claimed his patrol had found "the thing" during their dawn patrol to the Spiral Cromlech, a Kellid ruin overlooking the city that was notorious for ill fortune and mysterious disappearances—but never for mysterious appearances. Hearing a babe bawling amid the moon-bleached standing stones, the guards bold enough to investigate momentarily took her for some stray fiend-child and almost slew her amid the eerie ruins. Identifying her as a half-orc infant did little to stay the hands of those ready to mete out death, but the argument that matters of life and death should be left to Pharasma sheathed the blades of those not truly eager to spill a child's blood—regardless of the color of her skin.</p> 
               <p>Dubbed Imrijka after Gravecharge's first high priestess, Imrijka Castavelik, the pistachio-skinned girl was cleaned, clothed, and given a place among the cathedral's other orphans. At first she terrified those youths, being larger, stronger, and more vicious in her biting than some children double her age. But only for a time. The priestesses of Pharasma explained the mysteries of their goddess's will and the vastness and variety of her creations, teaching the children that they were blessed to have such a unique new sister. For a time, behind the cathedral's walls, that was even the truth.</p>

                <br> Illstruation by Wayne Reynolds
               </div> 
               <p>When she was old enough to understand and be understood, Imrijka reported to the offices of Jarlos Teym, Gravecharge's high exorcist, for the first time. He asked her a great deal about her life, how she felt about her studies, the clergy, the other children, and if there was anything he could do to make things more comfortable for her. A shy girl, Imrijka declined. Subsequent discussions bent toward the future, Imrijka's dreams, her prayers, and her vision for a long life. Finally, though, after months of building a rapport with the girl, Teym asked about her past. But for Imrijka, life began with the cathedral, priestesses, and other orphans. Teym pressed, insisting on answers, even verifying them with magic. After one particularly intense interview, a confused Imrijka finally started asking her own questions: Why did it matter? Why did Teym care? Couldn't what she might be outweigh what she might have been?</p> 
               <p>Deeming her mature enough to know, Teym explained his tenacity: someone had come to adopt Imrijka. Thrice. Every Kuthona for the past 3 years. First came a man dressed like a count's footman, articulate and with more questions than answers. He left after raising the clergy's suspicions with his too-pointed inquiries about Imrijka. A year later he returned, this time with a human woman of vulpine beauty who claimed to be Imrijka's mother—though her apparent age made that only the barest possibility. It was Teym's own suspicions and skill at discerning lies that kept the strangers from Imrijka, and the unusual pair left with wordless detachment. Finally, only a few months past—days before Teym's first meeting with Imrijka—the two strangers returned, led by a man dressed in white and silver. The bold newcomer spoke as one used to being obeyed and demanded Imrijka be handed over to him. Teym personally denied him, insisting to know what right he had to the girl. A father's right, the man persisted. The high exorcist ordered them out of the cathedral in that instant, but before they obeyed the man in white smiled. "She's not like us," he said, eyes glimmering. "Excellent."</p> 
               <p>Despite Teym's explanation, Imrijka understood only that her parents had come for her and that the high exorcist had sent them away. She held back both questions and tears, nodding blankly until Teym excused her. But she didn't return to her room. Rather, she exited through the front doors of Gravecharge and out onto the snowy streets—where someone waited.</p> 
               <p>A man in white sat upon the icy benches of the nearby circle, slowly feeding bits of shredded meat to the crows. Seeing Imrijka enter the plaza through the flurry of sound-deadening snow, he rose and walked toward her. Wary, she approached. In his gloved hand appeared a strange token, a disk etched with barbaric symbols and a figure impaled upon a spear. She reached for it.</p> 
               <p>A merciless iron arrow shattered the man's hand, sending the strange icon spiraling into the snow. Teym stood across the circle, another arrow nocked in his bent hawthorn bow. Around him whipped the black-edged crimson of Pharasma's inquisitors, woven flames that engulfed any flakes the whirling wind blew against them. "Back, girl," he commanded in a voice Imrijka had never heard him use.</p> 
               <p>The man in white might have been carved of ice. He had never flinched. Though the icon was knocked away, a tangle of disjoined fingers and bloodless flesh-ribbons remained outstretched toward Imrijka. Her small tusks clattered against her teeth, but she didn't scream.</p> 
               <p>"Another time, dear," the man whispered, just for her. Then the snow whirled around him. For a moment he seemed to be one with the cold, a blizzard-born prince. Then he was gone, leaving Imrijka cold and frightened—but not alone. High Exorcist Teym's cloak around her was heavy, and warm, and smelled strongly of tobacco and dust—what Imrijka imagined a grandfather should smell like. It didn't smell anything like the man in white.</p> 
               <p>Until Imrijka reached maturity and was fully able to defend herself, she rarely left Gravecharge Cathedral. When finally she did, it was in the crimson and black of an initiate inquisitor of Pharasma's faith. Even after the retirement of High Exorcist Teym, she continued to serve the church and the man she'd adopted as her grandfather, assisting him in his more scholarly pursuits as a consultant on religious antiquities at the University of Lepidstadt. She's traveled much of Ustalav and beyond—guarded an expedition to the boney towers of Kalexcourt, spent a night in the haunted hotel known as House Beumhal, been shouted off the porch of retired monster hunter Ailson Kinder (but not before getting her copy of <i>Hunter's Moon</i> signed), and had numerous other adventures. She regularly returns to Gravecharge, where several of her childhood companions have grown into positions within the church's sphere of influence—including Brel Vhalsik, an argumentative Kellid theologian with whom she shares a complicated relationship. But increasingly her interests and Teym's research send her beyond Ustalav's borders, where she treads with her goddess's blessing, bringing judgment to all who would violate the laws of life and death. In her travels she's faced significant prejudice, but tales of Pharasma's "monster monster-hunter" and Imrijka's ever-present arsenal convince most bigots to keep their fool mouths firmly shut. Through it all, she's never seen the man in white again—at least, not with total confidence, as there have been far too many shadows and half-recognized faces to be sure. She recovered his strange gift on that snowy day and wears the disk openly, hoping that someone someday might recognize it and lead her to some hint of where she came from and who she was. But for now, the future holds far greater promises for Imrijka, and she strides into it boldly, confident in her faith, where she's going, and who she is.</p>

              <h2>Chapter Two: The Gang</h2> 
              <div itemprop="articleBody"> 
               <p>"You're sure about this gang?" Fat Gorm fidgeted, rubbing his fingers together. "I only ask, because the hour presses on—"</p> 
               <p>"Sit easy." Tarrant hummed dancing wisps of music, which calmed him. He wondered how anyone who couldn't see music managed to relax. </p> 
               <p><span itemprop="description">They met at midnight in the Bloody Fang, a dive down in the Puddles district that catered to sailors, criminals, and the lowest of the low. The authorities of Absalom rarely made it there, and certainly not at this hour of night. Entering after sunset required a chit: a coin-sized disc of wood branded with a crude image of a dragon's fang. Tarrant turned his over in his fingers as he mentally rehearsed the plan.</span></p> 
               <p>It had taken three days to set up the meet—good timing, as the last of the expedition treasure would be arriving the next day. It would be stored in the Blackscale Blades' base of operations until appraisers could arrive and a full accounting could be made. The dishonorable adventurers were living it up in the city, spending coin freely and bragging of the dragon they had supposedly slain. Crossing them didn't seem wise, but Tarrant had spent the last three days coming up with a perfect plan. </p> 
               <p>In truth, the entire scheme had occurred to him seconds after Gorm told him about the hoard, but he'd given it some time to crescendo in his mind, the different parts of music falling into place. He couldn't play a symphony alone, however, and he hoped the crew gathering in the Bloody Fang would be exactly what he needed.</p> 
               <p>A man came tumbling in the swinging doors, rolled several paces, then lay groaning. The big Ulfen warrior who stepped in the door after him had pale skin and hair and many woad tattoos carved across his honed frame. If the show of force and muscle weren't enough, the hooked axe strapped to his back proved sufficient to discourage any would-be challengers. </p> 
               <p>"That would be Arlif, I reckon." Fat Gorm stumbled over the name. "They say his tattoos depict the men he's killed. Well—the memorable ones, at least."</p> 
               <p>"He must have killed a goodly number," Tarrant observed. "Where did you find him?"</p> 
               <p>"Mercenary. Been cracking heads around the island for about a year now. No one's ever heard him speak, but by <i>Torag</i> is he strong. And you did say you needed a tough." </p> 
               <p>"That is what I said."</p> 
               <p>Arlif dropped his chit on the table, waved for mead, and sat in brooding silence.</p> 
               <p>The sneak came next, though he didn't make nearly the entrance Arlif had. The halfling's silhouette in the creaking doorway looked like that of a child, but the worldly gleam in his eye belied that impression. Also, no boy-child, no matter how ludicrous his taste in fashion, would wear such a hat, with its sweeping red and gold feather. </p> 
               <p>"Eram Many-Fingers." Tarrant sighed. "I should have known you'd bring him in."</p> 
               <p>"I thought you liked the halfling. You've pulled many jobs together, right?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh indeed. More than even he can count." Tarrant nodded to where the halfling was indicating the number of drinks he wanted on his six-fingered left hand. "That doesn't mean you should trust him."</p> 
               <p>"Of course not," Gorm said, offended. "But we can trust him to be untrustworthy."</p> 
               <p>"Ah, my friends!" the halfling said. "I almost thought I'd come to the wrong place, but oh joyous day, here I find you! I'm off for a drink, you want something? No? Well then!"</p> 
               <p>The enthusiastic halfling headed off to find the nearest server.</p> 
               <p>The magic arrived next, in the form of a feminine shape in the Fang's door. The other patrons quieted and looked, but when Gislai drew back her hood to reveal her lank black hair, greenish skin, and small tusks, most glanced away. She smiled and stretched languidly, revealing the three daggers of Calistria on an amulet around her neck. </p> 
               <p>"Gorgeous Gislai?" Gorm said. "Why, Akayn? Why do you do this to yourself?"</p> 
               <p>"Have faith. Half-orc or no, Gislai is the best cleric for any heist I've ever worked."</p> 
               <p>"You mean you worked <i>her</i>."</p> 
               <p>"I'll not deny I like green." That made him think of the other night, and the way Ephere's leaf-scale armor clung to her body. "Besides, it's in the past. We're strictly professional now."</p> 
               <p>"This is going to go badly."</p> 
               <p>"Do you want to do this, or shall I sell you into indentured servitude right now?" Tarrant asked. "Maybe Doreset will discount you—he might just take your hands as payment."</p> 
               <p>Fat Gorm paled. </p> 
               <div class="blurb360">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Ephere.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Ephere_360.jpeg" border="0"></a>
                <br> Ephere seems to be the center of attention wherever she goes.
               </div> 
               <p>"There he is." Gislai strode to their table. "Liespinner, the city of Absalom did herself a disservice letting you out. Better to keep you sealed up there with the other thieves and traitors." </p> 
               <p>"Greetings to you too. Apologies for not writing—I was a bit chained up at the time." </p> 
               <p>"Good." The half-orc eased into a chair and put her boots up on the table. She toyed with one of her shuriken and nodded to Gorm. "Who's this? The coin?"</p> 
               <p>"The empty purse, actually." Gorm gave Tarrant an uneasy look. "Your take, your gang—have it your own way. But have a care too, yes?"</p> 
               <p>"Mm?" Tarrant asked. "Sorry, I was too stricken with Gislai's disarming looks. Anger serves her complexion admirably."</p> 
               <p>The half-orc glared at him. "And the spinning begins already."</p> 
               <p>Arlif watched the exchange in silence.</p> 
               <p>As Gorm slipped away, his stealthy tread seeming more of a waddle, Eram arrived with a tray of libations. Tarrant knew better than to take any—the halfling's thirst was legendary.</p> 
               <p>"Greetings." Tarrant spread his hands wide. "No doubt you've heard something of this already, but let me fill in the rest of the story. First, the reward is fantastic. Lord Doreset chartered a group of adventurers on a delve to uncover ancient treasures in what was supposed to be a deserted ruin. It turned out to be a dragon's lair, complete with a dragon—which the heroes slew—and a fabulous hoard. Once His Corpulentness learned of the hoard, he decided the original terms of the contract were far to unfavorable to himself, and immediately dispatched his good friends, the Blackscale Blades mercenary company, to make things right by claiming the entire hoard for Doreset. They're even now bringing the treasure back to Absalom to be stored until it can be appraised."</p> 
               <p>"Stored, you say," Gislai said. "Stored where?"</p> 
               <p>"Blackscale Hall, right?" Eram said. "Please say Blackscale Hall."</p> 
               <p>"Not quite," Tarrant said. "Doreset's stronghold: Hawkthorne's Shield."</p> 
               <p>Eram coughed out some of his rotgut, then drank it again. "What?"</p> 
               <p>"I thought you were insane." Gislai shook her head. "Now I <i>know</i> you are."</p> 
               <p>Arlif nodded slowly.</p> 
               <p>"No no no," Eram said. "When I agreed to this job, I thought we'd take it en route, not from gods-damned Hawkthorne's Shield!"</p> 
               <p>"I know robbing the tower may seem difficult," Tarrant said. "Walls of stone a spear's length thick, iron doors reinforced with steel bands, and every window, sewer grate, and rat hole sealed up tight with the best magic the Doreset family can muster. Not exactly a comfy place to live, which is why His Lordship houses his apartments elsewhere. But as a secure storage facility, it can't be beat."</p> 
               <p>"That's even worse than I thought," Gislai said. "What's your plan? We talk our way in? You, a notorious criminal, and we, your known associates." </p> 
               <p>"Yes," Tarrant said. "And while notoriety appeals to me, 'twould be kinder to my pride if you used the words ‘suspected' and ‘alleged' in your description."</p> 
               <p>"I stand by my words." She tossed a shuriken a hand's width into the air and let it sink into the table. "Maybe you want to try a ‘raving lunatic' game? It would fit."</p> 
               <p>"Because you're mad," Eram said. "<i>Mad!</i>"</p> 
               <p>"Leaving that aside for the moment," Tarrant said. "Even if we get in, and even if we manage to steal the treasure, getting out won't be easy. That place is as much a prison as a fortress." </p> 
               <p>"I have a ring that will teleport us," Gislai said. "Limited use, but it can potentially get us out. Or in, technically, if we know where we were going."</p> 
               <p>"Alas," Tarrant said. "Lord Doreset has the vault warded against such things, necessitating that the Blackscales bring the items in by hand. Not to worry, though." From within his tunic, he took a red silk bag little bigger than a coin purse, into which he inserted his entire arm, then withdrew it. "I lived in the tower for nearly a year, once upon a time—I know exactly how to get in and out again. Follow my plan, and there's no way we can fail."</p> 
               <p>"Plan? What plan?" asked Eram.</p> 
               <p>"Remember the ‘helpful peddler' job we pulled in Cassomir? And how you owe me?"</p> 
               <p>Eram shuddered. "You said you'd never bring that up again."</p> 
               <p>"I'm the Liespinner, Many-Fingers," Tarrant said. "We do this one the same way—haversack and all."</p> 
               <p>"We'll need luck," Eram said. "Sure you don't want to go seduce a priestess of Desna into this game?"</p> 
               <p>"Calistria can kiss as well as sting," Gislai said, scowling at the halfling. "We make our own luck. And no one's seducing anyone."</p> 
               <p>"Pity, that," Eram said.</p> 
               <p>Arlif had been watching, but something drew his attention past Tarrant.</p> 
               <p>"All seeming madness aside," Tarrant said. "My plan requires a blade, a thief, a caster, and a face—that's the four of us. Now we just have to find a lure. A means of distraction." </p> 
               <p>"You're still mad," Eram said. "We..." He trailed off and followed Arlif's gaze.</p> 
               <p>"A lure," Gislai said. "You think that's all we need?"</p> 
               <p>"With the plan I have? Yes. And—" He saw what Eram and Arlif were looking at. "Ah."</p> 
               <p>Sure enough, Ephere had entered the Bloody Fang and sat at a table ten paces removed. Her presence drew Tarrant's senses like a lodestone. He could smell her from here, like a sweet earthen incense, and see the faint green light of a tune she was singing under her breath.</p> 
               <p>Gislai followed his gaze, her frown deepening. "Who is she?"</p> 
               <p>"Inspiration." Tarrant got to his feet. "Pardon a moment, fellow conspirators and lady." </p> 
               <p>"Where are you going?" Eram turned to Gislai. "Where is he going?"</p> 
               <p>"I was wrong about the seducing bit." The half-orc shook her head. "He's always an idiot for a woman."</p> 
               <p>"Speaking from experience, are we?" Eram asked.</p> 
               <p>Gislai nodded gravely.</p> 
               <p>Tarrant made his way to Ephere's table. Without speaking or even looking up at him, she laid the Bloody Fang chit he had given her back at the Open Palm on the table. </p> 
               <p>Tarrant's heart sped up with everyone watching them. Every day of his life, he trod upon a stage for his enemies, and he loved every deadly hour of it.</p> 
               <p>Mindful of appearances, Tarrant swept a wide, attention-gathering bow. "Twice I have the honor and pleasure of your beauty, Lady Ephere." </p> 
               <p>"Liespinner," she said without looking at him. "I am in your debt for the service you did me last time we met." </p> 
               <p>"Did you remember my offer and come to test my tongue? With your true name, that is." </p> 
               <p>"Saleae Epheldera," Ephere said, the elven words falling from her lips like rain. She listened for his pronunciation and nodded in approval. "You speak my tongue well for a human."</p> 
               <p>"I travel," he said. "Now that we've been properly introduced, I've come to offer you a proposition. Ah!" He smiled broadly as she bristled at the word. "Apologies for my ill speech. I assure you, I intend nothing scandalous, but..." he took her hand and bent to kiss the ruby on her gauntlet, pausing to look into her eyes. "I will admit that my intentions are <i>entirely</i> dishonorable."</p> 
               <p>Ephere made no sign of backing down. He wondered again what she saw. His arrogance, certainly, but his earnestness? His desire for justice against Lord Doreset, a noble leech who'd grown fat at the expense of the weak and powerless?</p> 
               <p>At that moment, the doors flung open, and a tiny ball of flame sailed into the chamber. "Akayn!" came a shout.</p> 
               <p>Tarrant threw his arms around Ephere and sang of racing stallions on the far-away tundra. Feathers of golden light flowed from his lips and encircled his feet to hasten him as he carried Ephere past the table and out an open window.</p> 
               <p>The Bloody Fang exploded in flame behind them as they rolled out into the rainy darkness. Tarrant found himself lying side-by-side with Ephere, their faces close. He managed to look away long enough to see two familiar Hellknights near the front of the tavern, standing among a crowd of folk shouting for the watch or for water. Between the knights stood a tall blonde woman in severe black armor, who held aloft in her barbed gauntlets the source of the blast: a wand that smoked slightly.</p> 
               <p>Altara the Hound: Hellknight, hunter, and his favorite regret.</p> 
               <p>"Akayn!" she cried. "Show yourself!"</p> 
               <p>Excitement shivered through him. He thought that if he'd been on his own he might have liked to face Altara then and there—but he had Ephere to worry about. She might kill one or both of Altara's minions and <i>then</i> there would be trouble.</p> 
               <p>The elf shifted, and he put a hand on her breastbone to signal her to wait. He felt the heat radiating from beneath her armor. She stared at him dangerously.</p> 
               <p>Tarrant sang a quick spell his mother had written about him. Magic sculpted the smoke into an illusory likeness of Tarrant himself—tall, dark-skinned, with piercing eyes and a wry smile—which nodded to its creator and ran off down the street. Altara barked an order, and the Hellknights gave chase.</p> 
               <p>Ephere's eyes gleamed. "Yet again, you've caused me trouble, then saved me from it. What is it you want, Tarrant Akayn?"</p> 
               <p>"Well." Tarrant saw movement near the tavern. His allies had escaped—Gislai in particular was glaring at him. </p> 
               <p>He smiled. "How would you like a job?"</p> 
               <p align="center">∗∗∗</p> 
               <p>"Intriguing offer," Altara said as the sun rose outside Lord Doreset's manor. "But no."</p> 
               <p>"No?" The would-be betrayer looked shocked. </p> 
               <p>Lord Doreset, who was snoozing by the fire, smiled. "That is what she said."</p> 
               <p>"But—" Eram Many-Fingers sputtered. "But I'm handing Tarrant Akayn to you on a platter! Trussed up like a goose and delivered to your great, lovely, and honestly somewhat intimidating majesty!"</p> 
               <p>Altara yawned. "Do you know how I spent the last year? This year that the master you would so eagerly betray spent in prison here in Absalom?"</p> 
               <p>The halfling shook his head. </p> 
               <p>"Reading," she said. "Interviewing. Thinking. I've hardly slept nor ate. When my knights woke me to tell of a traitor at my doorstep, I'd only been abed an hour or so." </p> 
               <p>She rose, and the halfling flinched.</p> 
               <p>"I know this man," she said. "I know everything about his games here in Absalom, and I know all about your dubious allegiances. If you would betray your friend, what would stop you from betraying me? No." </p> 
               <p>She nodded toward Eram, signaling her knights to flank him.</p> 
               <p>"No deal, thief," she said. "The law will be satisfied in the law's way, not through the treachery of a sneak seeking to protect himself. In the end, I'll catch you all. And I will destroy you."</p> 
               <p>The halfling tensed just before the first Hellknight laid hands on him, then twisted free. His would-be captor overbalanced and tripped over the halfling, who seized the opportunity to jab the other knight with his dagger.</p> 
               <p>Lord Doreset spoke up. "Might as well let him go. Let the Liespinner think all remains well. Many-Fingers will tell him nothing."</p> 
               <p>"And if he does?" Altara asked. </p> 
               <p>"What, that he tried to betray him? No." Doreset laughed. "Unless of course this was part of Akayn's scheme, and he sent Many-Fingers himself. If so, he knows nothing significant."</p> 
               <p>"True." Altara—who had been drawing her sword—sighed and sat back in her seat. "Again, I counsel you to unbind my hands, and let me take Akayn by force. There is naught to be gained by playing this game. He will defeat you." </p> 
               <p>"And again, I remind you of our agreement." Doreset sipped his morning tea. "You almost spoiled my plan with your little fireball assault earlier—no more rash action. Akayn is a creature of great arrogance—he will come at us anyway. And when he does, we will be waiting."</p> 
               <p>Altara snorted. "Many have sought to outwit Akayn, and all have failed. How do you know he'll not make such a fool of you again?"</p> 
               <p>A smile spread across Lord Doreset's perpetually greasy lips. "Because I have my own secret knife to wield at the right moment."</p> 
               <p>He waved. On cue, a tapestry moved aside, and someone stepped into the chamber. Altara was confused until she saw the brand burning on the newcomer's chest.</p> 
               <p>She knew Tarrant Akayn—knew his strengths, and especially his weaknesses.</p> 
               <p>And this would be the end of him.</p>

              <h1 itemprop="headline">Pathfinder Society Survival 101</h1> 
              <p class="date">Monday, October 8, 2012</p> 
              <div itemprop="articleBody"> 
               <p><span itemprop="description">One of the concerns I have heard pop up lately, both on the messageboards and at shows, is that Pathfinder Society scenarios have become more deadly. I've heard horror stories about TPKs on the rise in various regions of the world. Let's see if we can help combat some of that and help the new player, or the low-level character of a veteran, with some options that may just prove useful.</span></p> 
               <p>One of the benefits of being a Venture-Captain before this job was that I met a wide variety of players throughout the southeast. Each and every one has their strong points and weaknesses. One of the strongest rules players I know from my time in Georgia was Jordan James. He survived quite a few tables I GMed, and most of the time, it was because of brilliant use of a piece of equipment I had never heard of or had seen used once at most. He has been discussing equipment that makes survival easier, specifically when it comes to lower-level characters, with the Georgia crowd for the last year through their Pathfinder Society lodge messageboards.</p> 
               <p>After speaking with Jordan this past week, he proved excited to share his thoughts on a few overlooked items that might just make the difference between your low-level character surviving or going to meet Pharsma earlier than anticipated.</p> 
               <p>Jordan advised, "Here we have a simple list of items I have found to be ridiculously useful, and sometimes critical, to have around for those situations that, if you aren't prepared, may very well turn into a TPK."</p> 
               <p>"Please do reply with items I've missed (there will be many) because the sole intention here is to provide a helpful thread for fellow adventurers, and to have a little fun in writing it," he noted.</p> 
               <p>So, what are some things that are just wonderful to have available in a pinch, and more often than not, are generally not well known?</p> 
               <blockquote> 
                <p><b><i>Elixir of Spirit Sight</i> (1,000 gp):</b> From <a href="/products/btpy8h6h"><i>Pathfinder Adventure Path #38: City of Seven Spears</i></a>, 1,000 gp for 1 minute of <i>see invisibility</i> and ghost touch for both your weapons and armor! Incorporeal entities got you down with strength drains and random irritating things that ignore your armor and halves your damage? Go to town on them with this wonderful concoction.</p> 
                <p><b>Bladeguard (40 gp):</b> Straight out of the <a href="/products/btpy8fo1"><i>Advanced Player's Guide</i></a> and into your martially inclined character's inventory. This clear resin protects a weapon from harmful attacks from oozes, rust monsters, and similar effects that corrode or melt weapons, rendering the weapon immune for 24 hours. One pot can coat one two-handed weapon, two one-handed or light weapons, or 50 ammunition items. Applying it takes 1 full round. Immersing the weapon in water or similar liquid washes it off. That's pretty useful for its cost.</p> 
                <p><b><i>Potion of Feather Step</i> (50 gp):</b> More <i>Advanced Player's Guide</i> spell goodness, and bottled for your convenience. For 10 minutes, you can ignore difficult terrain, and even take 5-foot steps in such an area, oh HADES YES! Seriously, have you got one of <i>those</i> wizards in your party? You know the type: crazy guy throwing around <i>stone call, sleet storm</i>, and other such "control" spells thinking he's awesome, when all he's really doing is making it impossible for you to move? This bottle is your answer (you can even throw the empty remains at the wizard afterward as a free action!). Smart wizards of the above type also keep a couple of these on hand.</p> 
                <div class="blurb360">
                 <a href="/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PZO1123-Treasure.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PZO1123-Treasure_360.jpeg" border="0"></a>
                </div> 
                <p><b><i>Potion of Invigorate</i> (50 gp):</b> Going into battle with a creature that can sap your endurance, leaving you fatigued or exhausted, this potion will banish that pathetic mortal weakness and allow you to ignore the associated penalties for 10 WHOLE MINUTES. Of course, when it runs out, you get not only the penalties, but also an extra d6 points of nonlethal damage for your arrogance in ignoring your natural limits—but hey, performance enhancements are just an easy way of separating winners from losers! Honestly, though, ignoring those penalties for 10 minutes, that's freaking awesome for 50 gp.</p> 
                <p><b><i>Potion of Delay Poison</i> (300 gp):</b> 300 gp might sound like a lot, but for that handful of gold, you get to tell any and all poisons coursing through your veins for the next HOUR to sit down, shut up, and wait for you to finish beating the stuffing out of the poor fool that thought poisoning you would be its ticket to victory. This is like antitoxin, but sexy.</p> 
                <p><b><i>Smoked Goggles</i> (10 gp):</b> So, medusa, basilisks, and other gaze-type critters suck. You can avert your eyes (50% chance to avoid the gaze, 20% miss chance that round), or close them (immune to the gaze, but then everything gains total concealment from you, which kind of sucks). The answer: These cheap-as-dirt goggles grant you a +8 circumstance bonus on your saving throws vs. gaze, and all you suffer is a 20% miss chance (and a -4 on Perception checks—I know, a real deal breaker there if you're using these for combat). More <i>Advanced Player's Guide</i> goodness.</p> 
                <p><b><i>Smelling Salts</i> (25 gp):</b> Speaking of <i>Advanced Player's Guide</i> goodness, one last entry is the useful smelling salts. These sharply scented gray crystals cause people inhaling them to regain consciousness. Smelling salts grant you a new saving throw to resist any spell or effect that has already rendered you unconscious or staggered. If exposed to smelling salts while dying, you immediately become conscious and staggered, but must still make stabilization checks each round; if you perform any standard action (or any other strenuous action), you take 1 point of damage after completing the act and fall unconscious again. A container of smelling salts has dozens of uses if stoppered after each use, but depletes in a matter of hours if left opened. That's just nifty.</p> 
                <p><b><i>Bracers of Archery, Lesser</i> (5,000 gp):</b> A wrist slot that offers +1 to hit with a bow you're already proficient with is okay, but the hidden gem is that it works like the greater variety in terms of providing you proficiency with ANY bow (excluding crossbows). For characters without any bow proficiency or chaffing under a short bow only restriction, save the feat, drop 5,000 gp, and be happy!</p> 
                <p><b><i>Elixirs</i> (250 gp):</b> These are pretty well known, but just in case, for a paltry 250 gp you can pack potions for a +10 competence bonus on Acrobatics Perception, Stealth, and Swim checks. Handy, but keep in mind the swimming one is sort of overshadowed by the <i>touch of sea potion</i> below.</p> 
                <p><b><i>Golembane Scarab</i> (2,500 gp):</b> It's a neck slot that detects golems within 60 feet and ignores their DR with weapon, unarmed, or natural attacks. This can be a nice little package of helpfulness here!</p> 
                <p><b><i>Pathfinder's Pouch</i> (1,000 gp):</b> This little gem from <a href="/products/btpy8az2"><i>Seekers of Secrets</i></a> functions as a small bag of holding, allowing one to store up to 10 pounds of items within its 2-cubic-feet limit. Why is it special? Because <i>detect magic</i> ain't got nothing on this pro—thus, a Pathfinder can keep important or dangerous items safe in its confines with little worry from guards, customs, and random searches. Even if the pouch is opened and turned upside down with a shake, as long as the proper command word remains unspoken, nothing in the extradimensional space will fall out.</p> 
                <p><b><i>Potion of Bestow Grace</i> (400 gp):</b> For good characters only, but this can be a sweet bonus if you happen to have the rare positive Charisma modifier (and aren't already a paladin). For 4 minutes, you get a sacred bonus on all of your saving throws equal to your Charisma score bonus. That's almost good enough to make me consider being good, almost...</p> 
                <p><b><i>Oil of Weapon of Awe</i> (300 gp):</b> For 3 minutes, your weapon not only gains a +2 sacred bonus on damage rolls, but if you score a critical hit, it causes the creature hit to become shaken for 1 round with no save. It can't be used on natural weapons (though it can on unarmed strikes), but the gravy is that when used on ranged weapons, it applies to missiles fired. Loving some of these <i>Advanced Player's Guide</i> spells.</p> 
                <p><b><i>Potion of Touch of Sea</i> (50 gp):</b> For a measly 50 gp, you get a 30-foot swim speed, +8 competence bonus on Swim checks, the ability to take 10 on Swim checks even when distracted or endangered, and even use the run action while swimming. While this is more than enough to leave the poor <i>elixir of swimming</i> curled up in a corner, the one caveat is that it doesn't enable you to breath underwater, but for 1 minute of duration, you are bloody well near a seal.</p> 
               </blockquote> 
               <p>The following are from the <a href="/products/btpy8mfq"><i>Pathfinder Society Field Guide</i></a>:</p> 
               <blockquote> 
                <p><b><i>Air Crystals</i> (50 gp):</b> An inexpensive personal <i>bottle of air</i>. Find yourself underwater, in a void, or otherwise bereft of air? Pop some of these beauties in your mouth and you've got 1 minute of breathing space to plan your escape (note that you can't talk while chewing on these crystals).</p> 
                <p><b><i>Comfort</i> (armor special ability) (5,000 gp):</b> Whoa. Okay, for 5,000 gp (doesn't even take up a slot of enhancement bonus on your armor) you get armor that is always clean, doesn't penalize you in hot weather, counts as cold-weather clothing in cold weather, reduces armor check penalties by 1 (minimum 0), AND regardless of what kind of armor it is, it can be slept in as if it were light armor! Note that only applies to being slept in, but my goodness, for anyone concerned about getting caught without their armor in the night, this is a sweet solution!</p> 
                <p><b><i>Dweomer's Essence</i> (500 gp):</b> Casters take note! For 500 gp this one-off pinch of powder may seem insane, until you notice that you can add it as an extra material component to any spell you are casting and receive a +5 bonus to your caster level to overcome spell resistance. It's like an on-demand <i>rod of piercing</i> spell, except it's available whenever you need it, stacks with the Piercing Spell feat if you really need that spell to land, and doesn't cost you an action to get out a rod or an additional level to apply the metamagic. This is the sort of awesome that I'd pay more than 500 gp for, so enjoy and keep some in the component pouch!</p> 
                <p><b><i>Fortunate Charm</i> (3,000 gp):</b> Anything that can help alleviate the terrible pain of lame dice is wonderful, and this neck slot beauty does just that once per day on a failed skill or concentration check. Since failing checks like that can often result in extremely severe consequences, 3,000 gp for that kind of love is just sweet.</p> 
                <p><b><i>Runestone of Power</i> (2,000 gp):</b> Wow, that's a lot of gold! Ever looked longingly at wizards and their fancy <i>pearls of power</i> letting them get free spells? Well, as long as you're a bard, inquisitor, oracle, sorcerer, or summoner you are in luck! For the cost of double an equivalent <i>pearl of power</i>, once per day (per runestone, of course) a spell you cast of its level uses the runestone's power and not one of your limited spells per day.</p> 
                <p><b><i>Potion of Stalwart Resolve</i> (300 gp):</b> New cleric spells to the rescue! For 3 rounds per pop, this little gem lets you ignore ability damage and penalties to any one ability score of your choice (unless it equals your total ability score, in which case you're still screwed). It has a short duration and doesn't protect you from ability drain, but when you really need to shake off some bad ability damage and get back into the fight, this is what you need.</p> 
               </blockquote> 
               <p>Now for a few from the <a href="/products/btpy8dmf"><i>Adventurer's Armory</i></a>:</p> 
               <blockquote> 
                <p><b>Weapon Cord (1 sp):</b> Cheap as dirt and twice as useful! If you are disarmed or drop your weapon, it never moves farther away from you than an adjacent square and you can recover it as a swift action. The caveat is you cannot wield another weapon with the same hand the cord is tied to, and removing the cord is either a full-round action (untying) or move action (cutting). Great for archers who never want to be separated from their bows.</p> 
                <p><b>Spring-Loaded Wrist Sheath (5 gp):</b> Retrieve any dagger, dart, wand, or equivalent-sized object (forearm length or so) as a swift action. Let me provide a simple example of why this is awesome. Your friend is 20 feet away and dying. You move to her, get out your wand, are out of actions, and she dies at your feet. With this wrist sheath, you move to her, produce your <i>wand of cure light wounds</i> with a swift flourish, and save her life. </p> 
                <p><b>Antiplague (50 gp):</b> Getting diseased can be really bad. Use this if you know you're moving into an area where such might be likely. For an hour, you receive a +5 alchemical bonus on Fort saves against disease. Even better, if you're already diseased, this will let you make two saves (no +5 bonus though) and use the better result. Good thing to have.</p> 
                <p><b>Vermin Repellent (5 gp):</b> Not a perfect defense, but it keeps individual vermin away and swarms of vermin must make a DC 15 Fortitude save to enter your square. Not bad for a 4-hour buff.</p> 
                <p><b>Allnight (75 gp):</b> Recommending "herbs" and "black market items"—I love this guide! Allnight eliminates the effects of fatigue for 8 hours, during which time you take a –2 penalty on all skill checks, and when the duration runs out, you're exhausted. The good news: Combine a couple doses with a couple <i>potions of lesser restoration</i> and you are the Energizer Bunny.</p> 
               </blockquote> 
               <p>And a few other generally useful items to have around:</p> 
               <blockquote> 
                <p><b><i>Potion of Blur</i> (300 gp):</b> Sure, the miss chance may only be 20%, but there are a couple nice bonuses during its 3-minute duration. First, since you gain concealment, most precision-based damage, such as from sneak attacks, won't work on you unless the user has some pretty special feats. Second, if you like to be stealthy, then here is your bottle of "hide in plain sight," since this grants you that necessary concealment you need to hide.</p> 
                <p><b><i>Oil of Align Weapon</i> (300 gp):</b> Your go-to spell when you need a weapon to bypass DR of the evil/good/lawful/chaotic types. Three minutes per use, so it should last long enough to even apply before combat if you know what's around the corner.</p> 
                <p><b><i>Potion of Remove Sickness</i> (50 gp):</b> For 10 minutes, you gain a +4 morale bonus on saves vs. disease and the sickened and nauseated conditions, or suppress effects already being experienced for the duration of the spell. While being sickened is annoying, some diseases, and especially being nauseated, really can make you useless, so this is a lifesaver. <i>Pro tip:</i> When you're nauseated, you can't take standard actions, so either pour this down a nauseated ally's throat on your turn, or hold it out and have one of your comrades do the same for you.</p> 
                <p><b><i>Potion of Negate Aroma</i> (50 gp):</b> For the sneaky types that are sick and tired of being given away by scent, one hit off this potion and you've got 1 hour of scentless scouting as long as you don't get doused in a new, smelly substance. </p>
               </blockquote> 
               <p>I know there are more, especially out of <a href="/products/btpy8tmc"><i>Ultimate Equipment</i></a>, but those are a few I really wanted to throw out! Post other great options and we all might just survive an extra encounter or two!</p>

               <p>Here she is, in all her magic-item-bedecked glory, shown here with regular-sized Seoni the sorceress for size-comparison purposes:</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/Secondary/WizKids/WZK70992-Secondary1_500.jpeg"><img src="/image/content/Secondary/WizKids/WZK70992-Secondary1_360.jpeg" border="0"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>What you see before you is the mighty Cadrilkasta, a wyrm blue dragon that serves as the primary nemesis of the campaign's fifth installment, <a href="/products/btpy8tdh"><i>"Into the Nightmare Rift"</i></a>.</p> 
               <p>Cadrilkasta has long haunted the skies of Varisia, scanning the countryside for signs of ancient Thassilonian ruins. So obsessed with the Runelords is Cadrilkasta that she has carved their runes into her chest, as shown in this close-up image.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/Secondary/WizKids/WZK70992-Secondary2_500.jpeg"><img src="/image/content/Secondary/WizKids/WZK70992-Secondary2_180.jpeg" border="0"></a> <a href="/image/content/Secondary/WizKids/WZK70992-Secondary3_500.jpeg"><img src="/image/content/Secondary/WizKids/WZK70992-Secondary3_180.jpeg" border="0"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>In the Shattered Star Adventure Path, Cadrilkasta is encountered digging up an ancient Thassilonian ruin looking for a powerful magical artifact. Since the PCs will likely have several shards of the potent artifact that serves as the basis of the campaign by the time they meet her, it's probably safe to say that she will be just as interested in them as they are in her.</p> 
               <p>When you plop this giant figure down on the table, it'll make an encounter your player characters won't soon forget! We're still trying to straighten out Seoni, and she only just met the dragon yesterday!</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/Secondary/WizKids/WZK70992-Secondary4_500.jpeg"><img src="/image/content/Secondary/WizKids/WZK70992-Secondary4_360.jpeg" border="0"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>As a case incentive, the <a href="/products/btpy8v08">Gargantuan Blue Dragon</a> is available for purchase only to customers who preorder a <a href="/products/btpy8v0b">Shattered Star Standard Booster Case</a> and to ongoing <a href="/products/btpy8o6b">Pathfinder Battles case subscribers</a>. The figure has been produced in extremely limited quantities, so order soon to make sure that you do not miss out!</p> 
               <p>Before I go, I wanted to take a moment to talk about dragons in general, and the philosophy of how we decide which figures to include in Pathfinder Battles sets. The Gargantuan Blue is our first Gargantuan dragon, but it definitely won't be our last. When news about this figure first leaked on the internet earlier this week, some long-time miniatures collectors expressed a bit of disappointment, because they've long wanted a Gargantuan Green Dragon, which has not been produced to date by any prepainted miniature company. As a longtime collector of prepainted miniatures, I assure you that I also want a Gargantuan Green Dragon, and am working hard to include one in an upcoming set.</p> 
               <p>Cadrilkasta is an important dragon in the Shattered Star Adventure Path. Since this set is designed to support that campaign, the blue dragon made for a logical choice as the case incentive miniature. Based on an incredible Wayne Reynolds painting and sculpted with amazing detail by WizKids, we're confident that this is a super-cool dragon that you will be glad to have in your collection, even if you've already got a giant blue dragon in it from a few years back.</p> 
               <p>It's our intention to do every "true" dragon in every size category, Small, Medium, Large, Huge, and Gargantuan. We plan to be producing prepainted miniatures for years and years, and I'm confident that we'll get to all of them eventually (some, like the green, probably sooner than later). But when a set is made to support an existing Adventure Path, as many of our sets will be, it's going to provide the dragons appropriate for that campaign.</p> 
               <p>For Shattered Star, that means a Gargantuan Blue. But I assure you, the rest of them are coming!</p> 
               <p>That's it for this week (and what a week it's been!). Check back next week for a return to the originally intended spooooooky theme. I've got some stuff that will scare you out of your socks!</p>

              <h2>Chapter One: The Liar</h2> 
              <div itemprop="articleBody"> 
               <p>"You owe <i>how</i> much?" asked Tarrant the Liespinner.</p> 
               <p>"My boy, my boy—don't fret." Fat Gorm's cheeks reddened like two overripe apples. "It's not so bad."</p> 
               <p><span itemprop="description">Tarrant cast his gaze around the Open Palm to check for eavesdroppers. Fat Gorm's tavern bore a fitting name, considering how often the dwarf asked his supposed friends for coin. Tarrant Akayn the Liespinner had been out of prison for all of two hours, and already the dwarf was hitting him up—and for a major take.</span></p> 
               <p>Tarrant cleared his throat. "I know Taldane isn't your mother tongue, but when you say ‘not so bad,' what you really mean is ‘cataclysmic,' yes?" </p> 
               <p>The dwarf shrugged. "'Tis a sum I can hardly pay myself, true—not without selling myself into slavery."</p> 
               <p>"And we can't have that, can we?" </p> 
               <p>"Do these hands look suited to manual labor?" Gorm clutched his chest. "Nay, far better for you to do this little task for me."</p> 
               <p>"Little task, you say," Tarrant said. "Rob the Blackscales blind?"</p> 
               <p>Stealing enough treasure to buy a small island out from under the Blackscale Blades—a rather disreputable mercenary party—didn't sound "little." Just days before, another adventuring company on a hunt for ancient relics had hit some haunted ruin in the mountains that unexpectedly housed a dragon. Apparently, there had been a disagreement with their patron, who had furnished the expedition with equipment and supplies. Specifically, he broke his contract and hired the Blades to claim all the treasure. One of the double-crossed adventurers was apparently an old friend to Gorm, and he'd tipped the dwarf off that even a fraction of the hoard would be more than enough to cover his debts. It was insane, of course, but lunatic risks were Tarrant's specialty and abiding passion. </p> 
               <p>"Coin's waiting—that and who knows what fabulous treasure?" The dwarf grinned ingratiatingly. "And think of your cut. You have debts of your own to pay off, I think."</p> 
               <p>"Strike where I'm weak, eh?" Tarrant asked. "You must really be desperate. Who owns your debt, Fat Gorm? What aren't you telling me?"</p> 
               <p>"It's Lord Doreset. He's the one financed the delve, and he owns my debt." The dwarf bit his lip. "Now, before you get upset—"</p> 
               <p>Tarrant sighed. "Of course. Because fate just loves me."</p> 
               <p>Emilano Doreset, a nobleman from Cheliax who'd relocated to Absalom some years ago, had never forgiven Tarrant for certain liberties he'd taken with the Doreset name, the Doreset holdings, and the Lady Doreset. He'd managed to get Tarrant thrown in prison for a year, but he could prove little. Doreset couldn't very well reveal the full extent of the Liespinner's crimes, when almost all the stolen coin came from Doreset's less-than-legal interests in the city. An unresolved grudge hung between them like a duelist's blade.</p> 
               <p>It stood to reason Doreset would squeeze one of the Liespinner's friends for revenge. Was this all a trap? If so, that only made the task more appealing.</p> 
               <p>His heart raced just thinking of it. The danger—the audacity! And above all, the <i>challenge</i>. It drew Tarrant like a rallying cry. How could he claim to be Golarion's greatest con artist if he backed away from such a game? </p> 
               <p>The front door stirred a bell on a chain, ringing in two men built like guard towers. They moved with the grace of practiced killers. Debt collectors? No—worse. Beneath their dusty robes, the newcomers wore black-forged steel studded with wicked barbs and fiendish motifs. </p> 
               <p>Hellknights. What were Hellknights doing all the way out here in Absalom?</p> 
               <p>First the Blackscale Blades, then Lord Doreset, and now <i>Hellknights</i>.</p> 
               <p>This was definitely a trap.</p> 
               <div class="blurb360">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-LieSpinner.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-LieSpinner_360.jpeg" border="0"></a>
                <br> Tarrant attracts trouble wherever he goes.
               </div> 
               <p>The entrance of the Hellknights sparked an exodus from the Open Palm. The elite lawkeepers of Cheliax were a rare sight in the city, but even to the unenlightened, their harsh intentions came clear. After a moment, only a few patrons remained, too nervous or drunk to do more than watch. They would be enough to bear witness.</p> 
               <p>"Better make yourself scarce, Gorm." Tarrant nodded to the thugs.</p> 
               <p>The dwarf scowled. "My thanks—you need anything from the cellar?"</p> 
               <p>"Anything from Qadira, by any chance? I do love the fruit of the desert."</p> 
               <p>"If you've got the coin." Tarrant frowned, and Gorm spread his hands. "What? I'm short."</p> 
               <p>Tarrant clicked his tongue, dismissing the dwarf, then hummed a low tone to focus himself. His mother had raised him among minstrels, and he had spent every night of his youth with lullabies from far-distant lands. She had sung a certain melody that would put a grown man to sleep, let alone a boy. He let that song flow from his lips, and golden magic took shape around his dusky fingers. Anyone could hear his music, but only he could see it.</p> 
               <p>When he turned to cast the spell however, he saw that the Hellknights had paused, turning their attention elsewhere.</p> 
               <p>An elf woman in leaf-patterned green hunting leathers sat at the center table, ignoring the knights who flanked her. Tarrant hadn't seen her arrive, which in itself made her remarkable. Her fine elven features—radiant skin framed by rich brown hair—made her even more so. Pupilless eyes like emeralds met Tarrant's own.</p> 
               <p>One of the knights leaned in close. "Your pardon, m'lady, but the menfolk here aren't worth your time. Why not try a real warrior?"</p> 
               <p>All eyes were on the elf and the knights now. Tarrant had never known the famously disciplined Hellknights to be distracted by something as trivial as beauty; but then, the elf was so beautiful that Tarrant himself found it difficult to look away. It was more than her appearance, though—there was something dark and powerful about her. She spoke to him on a deep, resonant level, like she was a lonely strain of music he couldn't quite grasp. Perhaps the knights were drawn to her for the same reason?</p> 
               <p>Tarrant managed to look away from her face long enough to note the elaborate golden bracers that extended the length of her forearms, each imbedded with a gemstone on the back of the hand. Her left-hand bracer boasted a pure white pearl, while the right hand—the one close to her bow—bore a bright red ruby.</p> 
               <p>"What, don't you speak Taldane?" The amorous knight reached for her shoulder.</p> 
               <p>The elf ignored him, but the gems on her bracers flickered with awakening magic.</p> 
               <p>This was about to go bad and bloody.</p> 
               <p>Tarrant sang three notes of his mother's song, loud enough that the first man looked up, startled at the sound. The magic in the music flowed from his lips, a golden ribbon of silk that wrapped around the knight. Tarrant kept singing as he slid off the stool and strode toward the confrontation. He drew his rapier as he went.</p> 
               <p>"What—" The Hellknight sank to his knees and then to the floor, sound asleep. </p> 
               <p>The other knight reeled, fighting his way free of the invisible ribbon of music. Even as the man drew his sword and turned to face the unexpected threat, Tarrant changed key and sang a warsong of the Mwangi Expanse, punctuating the words with resonant notes that exploded like starbursts in the Hellknight's face. This magic the knight needed no blessing to see, and the lights made him stagger, confused, long enough for Tarrant to skip over his sleeping partner. The knight parried Tarrant's feint, opening himself for a swift application of sword pommel to unhelmeted temple. The knight's eyes rolled up, and he sagged to the floor. </p> 
               <p>"And here I had worried." It seemed to Tarrant that they had put up surprisingly little fight for Hellknights—but then, he had struck from surprise, while they were captivated by the elf. He would have to remember that gift of hers.</p> 
               <p>Tarrant turned to bow to the woman who had made his job easier. "My thanks, lady, for letting me borrow your charms." He turned to go.</p> 
               <p>"Hold," she said.</p> 
               <p>Tarrant drew up short and turned back to her. "Tarrant Akayn the Liespinner at your disposal, lady." He trod back over the sleeping hellknight and bowed again. "What is your desire, beautiful one?" </p> 
               <p>The elf frowned. "You have done me a service tonight, human. Your kinfolk proved tiresome." Her words were music—to him, she spoke in summer rain.</p> 
               <p>"Ah, but these are no kin of mine. They neglect their own hygiene <i>far</i> too much." </p> 
               <p>He wondered, though. Most looked no farther than his dark skin—the touch of the exotic that spoke of a Mwangi father. But perhaps the elf's keen eyes saw his Chelish mother as well, who had taught him a love of music and cursed him with wanderlust.</p> 
               <p>Tarrant reached for the elf's hand, though she drew it back before he could kiss it. "You have an untrustworthy face," she said, adjusting her collar. She seemed particularly keen to preserve modesty. "Keep your distance."</p> 
               <p>Prickly as well as beautiful. He was in love already.</p> 
               <p>"Has the service I've done you this eve—rescuing those poor blighters from your graceful wrath—earned me the favor of your name?" He gave her his best smile. "I merely wish to tell the story accurately when I recount the tale of the most beautiful creature I've ever driven away with my rude manners." </p> 
               <p>Her eyes pierced him. Finally, she nodded slightly. "Among men, I am known as Ephere. The tongues of lesser races find the names of elves difficult."</p> 
               <p>"My tongue is up for any challenge, my lady. Yours especially. But stay a bit—"</p> 
               <p>Something hit him hard, making him drop his sword and stagger into her. They both fell to the floor, Tarrant atop Ephere, his hands in an impolite position. "Terribly sorry," he said.</p> 
               <p>Ephere hissed a curse that still sounded lovely in Elven and pushed him off. Strong hands dragged him away and pulled him up to face the Hellknight he'd clubbed. </p> 
               <p>"Tarrant Akayn." Steel scraped against leather as the knight drew out a heavy mace. "Down arms and submit to the law."</p> 
               <p>"Already half there." Tarrant indicated his fallen rapier. "About the ‘submit' bit, though—"</p> 
               <p>Ephere slammed a fist coursing with lightning into the knight's side. Shock ran through Tarrant as well, blowing the two of them apart. He tumbled gracelessly across a table while the Hellknight twitched and coughed his way to his knees. Ephere raised her other hand—this one wreathed in flame—to the knight's face. The man froze and stared into his imminent death.</p> 
               <p>"Wait," Tarrant managed, trying and failing to right himself. The shock stole his body's natural grace. "Fas-fascinating." </p> 
               <p>Ephere regarded him with curiosity as he staggered and levered himself up clumsily.</p> 
               <p>"You are a curious creature." Ephere's face held no pity of any kind. The elf turned her hand in front of the Hellknight's face, and the man winced despite his iron discipline. "You seek to stop me from killing this man?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh no—by all means, put yon fist through his face. That is, if you want half the Hellknights in Cheliax to board the next boat to Absalom looking for your blood." Tarrant finally managed to stop twitching. "Excellent plan." </p> 
               <p>She considered a moment, then pulled her fire gauntlet away. Instead, she touched her lightning gauntlet to the Hellknight's temple. The magic shocked him to the floor, unconscious.</p> 
               <p>"Useful," Tarrant noted.</p> 
               <p>The two of them stood staring at one another. Tarrant made sure everyone in the tavern saw them together, including the Hellknights. Then he took a wood disc the size of a coin from his pocket and tossed it to Ephere. She caught it deftly.</p> 
               <p>"Well, it's been a delight, lady, but now is when we part ways. Have a care with those weapons: the unwashed masses of Absalom might not appreciate their potency, but I think we both know how valuable and dangerous they are." He leaned in close. "And take care with the gauntlets, too."</p> 
               <p>Mouth open in shock, Ephere stared at him as he waved a salute, then left the Open Palm. As soon as he hit the doors, he chanted a song of lovers meeting by moonlight. The music flowed in the form of silvery wings around him, and he faded from sight, invisible.</p> 
               <p>He made his way around the back of the Palm, where he found Fat Gorm's considerable bulk wedged through one of the windows. Gorm yelped when Tarrant—still invisible—grasped his wrists and hauled him out into the street, where he lay panting. The effort broke the spell, and Tarrant reappeared, standing over the out-of-breath barkeep.</p> 
               <p>"Friends among the Hellknights, Gorm?" he asked.</p> 
               <p>"Collectors," said the dwarf. "They work for Lord Doreset, don't ask me why. I didn't expect it would be this dangerous. I can get the coin another way."</p> 
               <p>"Ease your waggling tongue—of course I'll take the job." That had never been in doubt—if anything, the skirmish with the Hellknights made Tarrant more excited to do it. "Consider it a favor to Lord Doreset—his being a nose that looks best tweaked."</p> 
               <p>"You have accounts to settle with Doreset," Gorm said. "That's good."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, yes I do." </p> 
               <p>Prison had served as an excellent refuge for a full year, excepting the bars and chains. And while he'd known a Chelish agent would spot him sooner or later once he left prison, he hadn't expected Hellknights to arrive on his trail so soon. It seemed too fine a coincidence, as though the enemies he'd left in his homeland had been waiting for him. Definitely a trap. </p> 
               <p>"What of that elf?" Gorm asked. "Is she with you?"</p> 
               <p>"A beautiful stranger," Tarrant said. "I almost regret using her as bait to throw the Hellknights off my trail."</p> 
               <p>"You're a villain, Liespinner," Gorm said.</p> 
               <p>"Indeed,' Tarrant agreed. "And I'll need a team of the same. The Blackscale Blades aren't going to rob themselves."</p> 
               <p align="center">∗∗∗</p> 
               <p>Altara the Hound tapped her barbed fingers on the thick darkwood arm of her chair. She liked sitting as little as she liked waiting. She was a woman of action, whose record in tracking down fugitives had earned her the nickname a dozen times over. "You failed." </p> 
               <p>Her men didn't shift from their stiff-backed parade rest. "We searched the Palm, but the dwarf was nowhere to be found." </p> 
               <p>She slammed her gauntleted fist down. "To the hells with the dwarf! Akayn is the real target."</p> 
               <p>"Tell me of this elf," said the noble fop seated across from her, speaking between bites of his second dinner. Corpulent Lord Doreset was always eating. "You say she was beautiful?"</p> 
               <p>"Unnaturally so," said one of the knights. "She may have been using some form of magic. She was... compelling."</p> 
               <p>"And the Liespinner seemed to know her?" Altara demanded.</p> 
               <p>The knight with the livid purple bruise on the side of his head nodded sharply. "He tried to make it look like he knew her, but I don't think he does. It might be a false trail."</p> 
               <p>"Tarrant Akayn has always been a fool for a pretty face. It will be his undoing." Altara stood. "Go."</p> 
               <p>Her men dutifully marched away.</p> 
               <p>"Patience, Altara." Doreset stuffed a fresh pastry in his mouth. "You'll have the Liespinner soon enough, and I'll have my coin back. There's no point in terrorizing the help."</p> 
               <p>Altara glared at him, then marched out of the room and back to her guest chambers. She shoved her borrowed desk over in a cascade of papers: reports, sketches, descriptions, all of the same man. She caught one—a rendering of his face, with its familiar cocky smile, and tore it in half with her barbed fingers.</p> 
               <p>"Tarrant Akayn," she murmured. "There will be a reckoning between us."</p>
