  \ we’re taking a look at upcoming products, revealing new art and details, and diving\
  \ deep into the day’s focus with a livestreamed Marquee Event panel and Q&amp;A\
  \ session. Today’s Marquee Event panel focused on Paizo’s forthcoming Pathfinder\
  \ Advanced Player’s Guide. This blog is a recap of some of the previews covered\
  \ in that session as well as a compilation of other Pathfinder announcements from\
  \ throughout the show. Don’t forget to check out the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh85\"\
  >PaizoCon Online Stream Schedule</a> to stay on top of the latest Paizo news in\
  \ real time!</p> \n     <p>As we approach the end of the first year of Pathfinder\
  \ second edition, we are excited to showcase some of our upcoming Pathfinder rulebooks,\
  \ adventure paths, and world guides, while also announcing where the game is headed\
  \ in 2021.</p> \n     <p>The panel that just concluded offers a lot of great previews\
  \ of the <em>Pathfinder Advanced Player’s Guide</em>, coming out at the end of July.\
  \ If you missed it live, you can check it out as a video-on-demand on <a href=\"\
  https://www.twitch.tv/officialpaizo\" target=\"_blank\"><b>twitch.tv/officialpaizo</b></a>\
  \ and archived on our YouTube channel in the near future. We’ll also be presenting\
  \ the usual series of preview blogs and media partner appearances in the coming\
  \ months, but if you just can’t wait, here’s a glimpse at a few pieces of art from\
  \ the book:</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/052820_AdvancedPlayersGuide.jpg\"\

  \ alt=\"\"></a>\n      <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\">The book’s gorgeous cover by\
  \ Wayne Reynolds, depicting Feiya, the iconic witch, and Jirelle, the iconic swashbuckler,\
  \ fighting (or fleeing from?) a colossal sea serpent</p>\n     </div> \n     <div\

  \ alt=\"\"></a>\n      <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\">An exciting scene of an oracle\
  \ fighting some hell hounds by Valeriya Lutfullina, featuring a brand new tengu\
  \ iconic (you’ll get a chance to meet him soon!) Other classes included in the book\
  \ are the investigator, swashbuckler, and witch.</p>\n     </div> \n     <p>“But\
  \ what,” you may ask, “do I do if I’m not an ‘advanced player?’” Have no fear, neophyte\
  \ Pathfinder, because we have you covered this fall with the <em>Pathfinder Beginner\
  \ Box</em>! Completely compatible with the <em>Pathfinder Core Rulebook</em>, this\
  \ all-in-one box pares down the options available to players to make their first\
  \ steps into the exciting world of Pathfinder as straightforward as possible. With\
  \ 4 pregenerated characters, a series of character and monster pawns, a 1st-level\
  \ intro adventure, and more, this is the perfect starting point for new players\
  \ of any age.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/052820_BeginnerBoxContent.jpg\"\
  ><img style=\"max-width:75%\" src=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/052820_BeginnerBoxContent.jpg\"\
  \ alt=\"\"></a>\n      <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\"></p>\n     </div> \n     <p>The\
  \ Beginner Box’s adventure takes place in the sleepy town of Otari just a few days’\
  \ travel from Absalom, but your troubles in Otari are just beginning! Picking up\
  \ at 2nd level—right where the Beginner Box’s adventure leaves off—and taking your\
  \ player characters to 5th level, <em>Pathfinder Adventure: Troubles in Otari</em>\
  \ is an anthology adventure designed to introduce new players to a variety of playstyles\
  \ and ease their transition into the world of character options presented in the\
  \ full Pathfinder game.</p> \n     <p>For groups looking for a longer campaign,\
  \ we are proud to announce the first 3-part Pathfinder Adventure Path, The Abomination\
  \ Vaults! This dungeon-based campaign, also set in Otari, takes a group of 1st-level\
  \ adventurers to 10th level, and tells a parallel story to that in the Beginner\
  \ Box and <em>Troubles in Otari</em>. The first chapter of Abomation Vaults, <em>Ruins\
  \ of Gauntlight</em> by James Jacobs, will be available in January, 2021.</p> \n\
  \     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/052820_AbominatinVaultsLogo.jpg\"\

  \ alt=\"\"></a>\n      <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\"></p>\n     </div> \n     <p>I\
  \ can hear you now: “But, Paizo, you can’t do just one 3-part adventure path without\
  \ throwing off your entire release schedule!” You’re right! That’s why we’re following\
  \ Abomination Vaults up with a second 3-chapter adventure path: Fists of the Ruby\
  \ Phoenix! This campaign starts at 10th level, allowing your Abomination Vault PCs\
  \ to pick it up after that campaign concludes, or it can stand alone as its own\
  \ story. We first saw the Ruby Phoenix Tournament—a worldwide test of martial arts\
  \ and magic held every 10 years—in 2011, so it’s fitting that we’d check back in\
  \ and see what’s happening with it on the next go-around. Look for more information\
  \ on this adventure path later in the year.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ few months ago, we released the <em>Pathfinder Gamemastery Guide</em>, and just\
  \ this week the <em>Pathfinder Bestiary 2</em> hit shelves and online retailers\
  \ worldwide. Now, we’re thrilled to announce the <em>Pathfinder Bestiary 3</em>\
  \ for a March, 2021 release to fill in the gaps of any iconic Pathfinder monsters\
  \ that didn’t make the cut for the first two bestiaries. Let us know what you’d\
  \ like to see included after checking out the newly released <em>Bestiary 2</em>.</p>\

  \     </div> \n     <p>Lastly, we take a look at the future of the Lost Omens line\
  \ of world guides, detailing the tumultuous Age of Lost Omens in which the Pathfinder\
  \ world finds itself now. Following the release of <em>Pathfinder Lost Omens: Pathfinder\
  \ Society Guide</em> in September, we’ll next delve deep into the uncommon and rare\
  \ ancestries of the setting with the Pathfinder Lost Omens Ancestry Guide. This\
  \ indispensable sourcebook for players and GMs presents new character options for\
  \ the many ancestries that have appeared in rulebooks other than the Pathfinder\
  \ Core Rulebook, provides everything a player needs to play a member of such fan-favorite\
  \ returning ancestries as android, geniekin, and kitsune, as well as a few ancestries\
  \ that have never been available to player characters in the past!</p> \n     <div\
