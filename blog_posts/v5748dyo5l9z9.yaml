  \ Scenario Sneak Peek</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Thursday, July 3, 2008</p> \n\
  \   <p>Last Saturday night, Craig Shackleton gathered together a number of Paizo\
  \ Origins attendees in the lobby of the Drury Inn in Columbus, OH and ran us through\
  \ the first ever installment of a Pathfinder Society Scenario. The aptly named Frozen\
  \ Fingers of Midnight kept a bunch of us up way too late as we explored Absalom\
  \ in service of the Pathfinder Society. Our mission was to find the cause of a freezing\
  \ sickness that had infected a highly-regarded emissary from the Land of the Linnorm\
  \ Kings.</p> \n   <p>Ever the bunch of roleplaying fanatics, we created a freak\
  \ show menagerie of characters too weird to live and too rare to die:</p> \n   <p>Erik\
  \ Mona was Ecritus, a pathfinder in service to the Cheliax faction and a Cleric\
  \ of Asmodeus with a voice much like the Monarch from The Venture Bros. cartoon\
  \ on Adult Swim. Barely able to tolerate his less intelligent brethren, Ecritus\
  \ used every opportunity available to him to manipulate his fellow pathfinders into\
  \ doing his bidding. </p> \n   <p>Michael (a representative from the company printing\
  \ the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game beta) played Angelo, a pathfinder Paladin in service\
  \ to the Andoran faction and completely unsure of the terrifying rabble the Pathfinder\
  \ Society assigned him to in order to solve the mystery of the freezing sickness.\
  \ A quiet, jovial sort, Angelo spent most of the scenario in the background, steering\
  \ clear of Ecritus and Jason Bulmahn's character.</p> \n   <p>Jason played Dar-An'Sumat,\
  \ an Osirion necromancer obsessed with sending the dead to their proper resting\
  \ place in Pharasma's embrace. Ever the loyalist, Dar was also a member of the Osirion\
  \ faction, and while trying to complete his faction's mission in the scenario, spent\
  \ a great deal of time with his hooks, cotton cloth, and flensing knives sending\
  \ the deceased foes of the party to the great beyond. Jason was decidedly creepy\
  \ in this role.</p> \n   <p>Chris Self, Paizo's Sales Manager, played a sorcerer\
  \ of the Cheliax faction named Blase. In any other group of pathfinders, Blase would\
  \ be creepy and strange, but when put up against the creepy and strange Osirion\
  \ and Blase's fellow Chelaxian, he was pretty tame. Chris played him dark and goth-like.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>My own character was an Ulfen barbarian with an incredibly long and unpronounceable\
  \ name in service to the Qadiran faction. He was a member of the Pathfinder Society\
  \ because the society's goal of protecting and seeking knowledge matched his own.\
  \ Cast out from the Land of the Linnorm Kings as a youth, he wandered the Inner\
  \ Sea educating himself in the ways of more civilized peoples. I played him as a\
  \ smart, well-spoken Dolph Lundgren-type who saw violence as a last resort and would\
  \ blackout when flying into a rage. He was fun to play and very difficult to roleplay\
  \ around some of his more violence-first-then-questions-asked adventuring companions.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Lastly, and certainly not least, was Nicolas Logue as the Ulfen cripple\
  \ and albino rogue, Thalg Sickeyes. In Nick's own words from the <a href=\"/paizo/messageboards/paizoPublishing/pathfinder/pathfinderSociety/general/postYourGenConCharacterConceptsHere\"\
  >Post Your Gen Con Character Concepts Here!</a> thread on the Pathfinder Society\
  \ messageboards, \"His bloody birth ended his mother, thus he claimed his first\
  \ life before he took his first breath. He was born with his left arm crippled.\
  \ It remains palsied to this day. Thalg is an albino, with sickly yellowed pupils\
  \ and stringly white hair.\" Click the link to the thread to read more about Nick's\
  \ decidedly twisted take on an Ulfen rogue.</p> \n   <p>Our first foray into a Pathfinder\
  \ Society scenario was a blast. Craig Shackleton has written a fantastic little\
  \ adventure for Gen Con and I'm positive everyone who gets a shot at playing Frozen\
  \ Fingers of Midnight will be impressed as well. Who knows, if you're lucky, you\
  \ may even get Craig as your GM. </p> \n   <p>Stranger things have happened.</p>\
