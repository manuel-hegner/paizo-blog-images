  >Starfinder</a> is very much a science fantasy universe, with a lot of science fiction\
  \ ideas mashed together with more fantastical and supernatural concepts. This isn't\
  \ an accident, but an inevitable conclusion to asking the question \"What happens\
  \ if advanced technology becomes commonplace in the Pathfinder universe?\" In Starfinder,\
  \ it's well accepted that there are forces beyond the understanding of pure science\
  \ which, whether you want to refer to them as arcane, divine, or psychic, are best\
  \ thought of as just \"magic.\" There are options for players who want to add just\
  \ a little magic to their character (ranging from the Connection Inkling and Psychic\
  \ Power feats to the phrenic adept archetype, which can be accessed by any class),\
  \ but significant magical ability is primarily in the hands of the mystic and technomancer\
  \ classes.</p> \n    <p>We'll talk about the technomancer later on, but for now,\
  \ here's the description the mystic gets in the <a href=\"/products/btpy9qy1\"><em>Starfinder\
  \ Core Rulebook</em></a>:</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><i>You understand that\
  \ what most people call magic is simply an expression of the innate connection between\
  \ all things, and you intuitively tap into this unseen power to create strange effects.\
  \ You may conceptualize the source of your magic as divine grace, a manipulation\
  \ of fundamental energy, or an unlocking of psychic potential, but always with the\
  \ knowledge that you are a conduit channeling forces greater than yourself. Though\
  \ you may study, you understand that spellcasting—like all existence—is messy and\
  \ intuitive, and you specialize in biology and mental systems too complex to be\
  \ perfectly understood by science. You sense the intangible and exploit your bonds\
  \ with others, whether to bolster them or bend them to your will.</i></p> \n   \
  \ </blockquote> \n    <p>While a great deal of a mystic's focus is on more esoteric\
  \ truths that are represented by class features, they are still scholarly enough\
  \ to gain 6 skill points per level and have 12 class skills. Since their abilities\
  \ may require attack rolls in combat, they have the same average base attack bonus\
  \ as the envoy and operative, but only gain proficiency (and eventually specialization)\
  \ with light armor, small arms, and basic melee weapons. Their focus on comprehending\
  \ the secrets of existence give them a good Will save progression, and makes Wisdom\
  \ their key ability score.</p> \n    <p>Mystics' studies also grant them access\
  \ to mystic spells, ranging from 0-level to 6th level, which represent a significant\
  \ part of their power. Mystic spells are more likely to focus on philosophy, natural\
  \ systems, mental endeavors, and living things than the more physics- and technology-oriented\
  \ technomancer spells. This gives them access to numerous charm and emotion spells,\
  \ spells focusing on telepathy and thought, and spells that cure or restore balance\
  \ to living things. However, they also have some powers drawn from natural forces\
  \ such as radiation and some force-based telekinetic powers. How a mystic operates\
  \ can be strongly influenced by their choice of spells known—<i>fear</i>, <i>force\
  \ blast</i>, and <i>hold person</i> are all useful 2nd-level offensive mystic spells,\
  \ but each comes with its own advantages and limitations.</p> \n    <p>All mystics\
  \ gain some ability to link to other creatures, which manifests as a healing touch\
  \ used once per day at 1st level, but expands into a mindlink you can establish\
  \ with creatures by touch, and eventually a telepathic bond you can maintain with\
  \ up to six creatures at a time. Mystics can gain other powers that work through\
  \ this connection, depending on their chosen connection.</p> \n    <p>What's a connection,\
  \ you ask? Much of the focus of a mystic comes from their choice of a connection:\
  \ a link to some force that the mystic sees as the source of their power, and which\
  \ helps shape their approach to their abilities. Many mystics serve as clergy and\
  \ see their gods as the source of their powers (though the priest theme is available\
  \ to a character of any class), but a connection can also be to a philosophy, a\
  \ mysterious patron, or nearly anything else a player chooses. Regardless of what\
  \ power fuels the mystic's connection, each connection has a specific focus that\
  \ grants the mystic a set of powers and bonus spells known. The mystic selects from\
  \ the akashic, empath, healer, mindbreaker, overlord, or star shaman connection,\
  \ which grant powers ranging from access to the Akashic Record to the power to explode\
  \ heads.</p> \n    <p>Here's a sample of a connection power, this one gained by\
  \ mindbreakers at 3rd level.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <h3>Backlash (SU)</h3>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"stat-block\">Whenever a foe succeeds at a Will save against\
  \ one of your spells and completely negates the effect, that foe takes 1 nonlethal\
  \ damage for each mystic level you have. This is a mind-affecting pain effect.</p>\
  \ \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Having examined the envoy, mystic and operative,\
  \ next week we'll preview our most combatant-focused class, the soldier!</p> \n\
