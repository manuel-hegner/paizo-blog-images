  \ \n     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">The floor lurches again,\
  \ heaving back and forth. The platform’s stabilization thrusters are no match for\
  \ the behemoth’s sheer mass, and it is one mad beastie. Gotta drive it back before\
  \ it crushes us. </p> \n      <p>I punch the comms. “Zarek and Siminira, take it\
  \ head on. Kikitak, Abery, loop around and come at it from behind. Maybe we can\
  \ distract it.”</p> \n      <p>The channel’s open, so I can hear their chatter as\
  \ they scramble. </p> \n      <p>“Is that a cloud-skate?”</p> \n      <p>“If so,\
  \ it’s the biggest one I’ve ever seen.”</p> \n      <p>“Don’t care, work to do.”\
  </p> \n      <p>“Yeah, come on, we can take it!”</p> \n      <p>There are only four\
  \ of them, a dragonkin-ryphorian bonded pair, a renegade haan, and a hotshot human\
  \ with almost intolerable bluster but enough skill to somehow back it up. They’\
  re good, all of them, but the fighters are tiny compared to this thing. No way they\
  \ can take it down. Best we can hope for is to distract it, get in its way, run\
  \ interference. “Buy me some time, I’ve got gunners to back you up.” </p> \n   \

  \ hspace=\"5\" alt=\"On the cloudy surface of a gas giant planet, a squadron of\
  \ small fighters scrambles to combat a massive space worm threatening their small,\
  \ floating platform settlement\"></a>\n       <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Illustration\
  \ by Alexandur Alexandrov</p>\n      </div> \n      <p>The turrets are rising from\
  \ their enclosures, and I tap into Tabbet’s channel just long enough to make sure\
  \ her team—her family, that is—knows what they’re doing. I’ve never met a group\
  \ that can cram so many words into such a small space of time, and my command of\
  \ the Ysoki language is on the rough side at best. Tabbet’s direction carries over\
  \ the exuberant cacophony at finally getting to use the “big guns,” and the turrets\
  \ start firing in coordinated patterns and targeted strikes. I close the channel,\
  \ and I can’t help but chuckle. Why is it that ysoki take such delight in finding\
  \ the biggest weapons they can?</p> \n      <p>But the turret fire on this flying\
  \ plasma worm is like poking a replenigel megavitamin with a toothpick. We’re never\
  \ gonna take it down like this. The creature lashes out with an electrified tentacle.\
  \ The platform lurches again, and alarm klaxons start blaring. This one’s bad—if\
  \ we lose power, we’re cloud-worm food.</p> \n      <p>I punch up a new channel.\
  \ “Ithlithoi, you all on that?” Before I’m even done talking, their singsong response\
  \ is assuring me it’s under control. Thank Weydan for barathus and their combination\
  \ of adaptability and competence. </p> \n      <p>Kikitak and Abery sweep just above\
  \ the central dome, so close it shakes my command tower. The thing lurches after,\
  \ and a blast of plasma crashes down. The station’s automated fire suppressants\
  \ kick in to control the blaze. That better not spread to the storage tanks. If\
  \ they breach, this whole station’ll blow out of the sky. </p> \n      <p>I stop\
  \ dead in my tracks. <em>There’s</em> an idea that might save our skin! </p> \n\
  \      <p>I’m shouting orders into my comm unit as I run. The barathus need to drop\
  \ everything and get the platform stabilization thrusters from the preprocessing\
  \ dome. “Yes, it’ll fall into the planet’s core. Better it than us!” I want Tabbet\
  \ and the biggest gun she can find. Need an engineer. “Unit Z-81, get to the tank\
  \ bay and rip the power core out of our Titan Hauler. <em>Now</em>.”</p> \n    \
  \  <p>No time for an elevator; I pull the emergency escape bar on the window and\
  \ jump out after the falling pane of glass. It shatters as it hits the platform,\
  \ but I’ve got a spell for this and touch down gently, already sprinting. </p> \n\
  \      <p>Our ragtag team assembles in the tank bay. Z-81 is already hotwiring the\
  \ starship power core as the barathus strap the platform’s thrusters around the\
  \ gas storage tanks. Tabbet shows up with a reaction cannon almost as big as she\
  \ is, grinning ear to ear. </p> \n      <p>Another crash in the station, and this\
  \ time the power goes out entirely. I pull up a bit of my own magic and outline\
  \ everything with a bit of dancing blue-green light so we can keep working. Welders\
  \ are flaring, wires and straps are sticking up like an electrovore’s spines, sparks\
  \ are flying everywhere—Weydan help us, I hope this doesn’t blow right here because\
  \ that’ll be the very sudden end of us all.</p> \n      <p>And then it’s ready.\
  \ I call up my fighters as our ad-hoc engineering crew scatters back. “Lead it this\
  \ way, toward the storage banks. Make it mad enough to scream, then get the hell\
  \ out of the way.”</p> \n      <p>I look at Tabbet. “You get one shot at this.”\
  \ She grins again and leans in to the sight of this makeshift anti-giant-flying-plasma-worm\
  \ missile we’ve built. </p> \n      <p>It comes at us fast, fighter thrusters screaming\
  \ as Zarek and Siminira work in perfect coordination, both peeling off at the last\
  \ possible second, mere yards from the tank bay doors. The creature’s close on their\
  \ tails. We’re staring down a tunnel of arcing electricity lined with fangs bigger\
  \ than a shuttle.</p> \n      <p>Tabbet pulls the trigger.</p> \n      <p>At first,\
  \ nothing, and I wonder if we failed. Then a hum, a whine as the power core overclocks,\
  \ and a concussive blast that knocks us all to the floor as the reaction cannon\
  \ fires. The repurposed thrusters kick to life with a deafening roar, flaring like\
  \ miniature supernovas as they burn through their entire lifespan of output in milliseconds.\
  \ The entire station lurches back from the recoil as the gas storage tanks go from\
  \ stationary to a blur that might outpace a Terminator Star Drake racer in the blink\
  \ of an eye. I’m grateful for the polarized visor I wear—normal lighting is painful\
  \ enough, this would have left me permanently blind. </p> \n      <p>Our makeshift\
  \ meteor careens forward, straight into the arcing blue nightmare maw about to rip\
  \ our station to scrap, and there’s a horrible moment where I’m convinced it won’\
  t make any difference.</p> \n      <p>And then it blows, ripping through the creature\
  \ in a series of phenomenal, scorching explosions as the tons of compressed flammable\
  \ gas meet the creature’s plasma gullet. It blows apart from the inside out, a spray\
  \ of gelatinous blue chunks that arc with residual electricity splattering the station’\
  s onion domes. The creature’s seared head squashes gently into the side of the station\
  \ and spins off, sinking into the depths of the gas giant core below.</p> \n   \
  \   <p>I breathe. </p> \n      <p>The station’s leaning at a precarious angle, knocked\
  \ almost sideways from the blast, as the remaining stabilization thrusters slowly\
  \ begin to compensate. I still can’t hear. The station’s emergency lighting flickers\
  \ and wavers, and I can only imagine that every klaxon aboard is blaring. Guess\
  \ I’m glad I can’t hear that.</p> \n      <p>But Tabbet is jumping up and down,\
  \ pumping her little fist in the air and shouting as a dozen other ysoki pile into\
  \ the bay and tumble into a celebratory heap. The barathus float over and drape\
  \ their tendrils across the lot of us in an awkward show of camaraderie. Z-81 rolls\
  \ up and bumps into my hip, blinking—and presumably beeping—cheerfully. I have no\
  \ idea what the fighters are saying, but I can see them circling the station. I\
  \ imagine they’re cheering too. </p> \n      <p>There’s a ton of work to do, of\
  \ course, and we’re not unscathed. I’ve got a few burns, angry red showing through\
  \ purple skin, and Tabbet’s whiskers are scorched down to nothing. Ithlithoi has\
  \ merged back into one being and is working through several adaptations in a pattern\
  \ I recognize as one that repairs damaged tissue. </p> \n      <p>But we’re alive,\
  \ against all odds, thanks to a desperate plan we pulled off by the seat of our\
  \ pants. For now, we celebrate, and try not to think about the weeks of repairs\
  \ still to come. Or the electrified goo slathered over the domes. Or the fact that\
  \ we just blew up a month’s worth of mining output—and the power core of our only\
  \ starship. I pointedly ignore the thrusterless preprocessing platform as it slowly\
  \ sinks into the clouds below.</p> \n      <p>“All right, everyone. Let’s get this\
  \ hunk of junk fixed up enough that we don’t sink into the core, and then take it\
  \ easy. Meet me on the command floor tonight—we’ve got one hell of a party to throw.”\
