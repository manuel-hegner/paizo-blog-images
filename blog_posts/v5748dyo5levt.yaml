  >As the creator of the Forgotten Realms, Elminster, and countless game books and\
  \ novels (seriously, we couldn't even begin to count them all), Ed Greenwood is\
  \ one of the most influential figures in fantasy gaming. Now that folks are finally\
  \ getting a chance to check out his new Pathfinder Tales novel, <a href=\"/products/btpy8ywc\"\
  ><i>The Wizard's Mask</i></a>, we thought it would be fun to do an all-new interview\
  \ with the wizard himself, asking questions about both his new book and his not-so-humble\
  \ origins...</span></p> \n    <p><b>In your own words, what's <i>The Wizard's Mask</i>\
  \ about?</b><br> It's about being a misfit in society, and finding your own way\
  \ (your own life, how you can fit in and meet the world on your terms as much as\
  \ possible, not just accepting one of the lowest rungs on society's ladders—a slave\
  \ or a shunned individual). Not just for major characters, but (if you ponder this\
  \ while reading) for darned near every character in the novel.</p> \n    <p><b>Without\
  \ spoilers, what was your favorite aspect of this novel? What was the most fun part\
  \ to write?</b><br> The banter between the two main characters, as they (rather\
  \ uneasily) got to know each other, then started to slide into friendship.</p> \n\
  \    <p><b>Who's your favorite character and why?</b><br> I can't choose one. The\
  \ Masked is a mystery man and I love mysteries, and Tantaerra is a feisty escaped\
  \ slave literally looked down upon by most people she meets, and they clash but\
  \ are forced to work together. If I'm forced to pick a favorite character, it would\
  \ be the team/partnership the two of them form, however uneasily and reluctantly,\
  \ to stay alive in the rather harsh claws of adventure. (By the way, no weak female\
  \ leads in this book!)</p> \n    <p><b>What drew you to this particular region of\
  \ Golarion as the setting for a novel?</b><br> It was one of half a dozen areas\
  \ that intrigued me enough to suggest them as settings for a novel. As a storyteller,\
  \ the \"rebels in the woods\" aspect of Nirmathas appeals to me (lots of room for\
  \ adventure and for individual heroics), and as a game designer, I need to see how\
  \ a militaristic, authoritarian land like Molthune looks and feels when you're living\
  \ in it. Does everyone \"cheat\" authority in small ways (i.e. as much as they dare)?\
  \ Are the leaders corrupt, or do those under them cynically see them as corrupt?\
  \ Do citizens chafe under the laws and those who keep them, or see them as the foundations\
  \ of peace, prosperity, and personal safety? (And why hasn't this military powerhouse\
  \ conquered Nirmathas yet?) Both lands should be changing under the goad of drawn-out\
  \ war, and I want to see that, AND experience how it feels to travel through where\
  \ they clash.</p> \n    <p><b>What's your favorite part of Golarion that you haven't\
  \ written about yet?</b><br> I have several candidates for a favorite, depending\
  \ on what mood I'm in. The Mana Wastes offer a GREAT setting for episodic, \"Conan-like\
  \ lone wolf or pair of travelers\" adventures, but I also love to explore intrigue\
  \ among nobles or within a guild, or gritty urban adventures in large, sinister\
  \ cities, like Kaer Maga. And I can't resist any chance to explore the idea of adventurers\
  \ setting up their own realms or holds, as I did in the Border Kingdoms in my Forgotten\
  \ Realms setting, or that Golarion offers in the River Kingdoms. And then there's...\
  \ heh, as you can see, pinning me down to just one \"favorite part\" is going to\
  \ be as tough as \"favorite character.\" I want it ALL.</p> \n    <p><b>How did\
  \ you first get into writing?</b><br> I started by asking my father for sequels\
  \ to books I read in his den as a very young kid (I was reading books for grown-ups\
  \ when I was four years old), and writing those sequels whenever he told me the\
  \ pulp-era (or earlier) writer whose book had grabbed me was dead, so if I wanted\
  \ to read any more, I'd have to write them myself. Most of my attempts were dreadful,\
  \ but I was starting to write about the Realms by age 6, and was published by then,\
  \ too, (not Realms fiction, but romance and \"smart-aleck first person narrator\
  \ space opera\"). No, I'm not going to name titles and publishers. Most of my early\
  \ work is BAD. (Hey, you in the back there, I HEARD that observation about the quality\
  \ of my later work!)</p> \n    <p><b>Any advice for aspiring writers?</b><br> Read,\
  \ read, read. Everything, not just the genre or styles of writing you're most interested\
  \ in. See what \"works\" for you, and what doesn't. Then write, write, write. Set\
  \ what you write aside for a few months while you read and write other stuff, then\
  \ go back to it, read it, and fix it. As in, rewrite anything that seems weak and\
  \ awkward. The age of computers means we don't have to throw earlier drafts away;\
  \ always work on clearly dated copies, but never think your words are perfect. Don't\
  \ be afraid to rewrite. (Just learn to stop rewriting and FINISH something, too!)\
  \ Lather, rinse, and repeat. But try new things all the time, to avoid falling into\
  \ a rut and burning out. The famous elder-days SF editor John Campbell was famous\
  \ for telling writers, \"Good story, but this time tell it from the point of view\
  \ of the airlock (or the spaceship's computer, or the hero's blaster gun) and I\
  \ might buy it.\" Try that. You'll never know if you're the world's greatest winemaking\
  \ and tuba-playing cheese sommelier if you never try any of those things. (And if\
  \ you suck, well at least you've tried making wine and judging cheeses and playing\
  \ the tuba—you've LIVED!)</p> \n    <p><b>What's an interesting bit of trivia that\
  \ our readers might not know about you?</b></p> \n    <p>In my youth (as in, when\
  \ I still had knees that worked), I often explored caves, and fenced (usually not\
  \ at the same time, and by \"fenced\" I mean swung swords, not fixed fences, which\
  \ is the only sort of fencing I do these days). Before I had throat surgery, I could\
  \ sing (deep basso profundo), too. And I had nicer legs than I do today.</p> \n\
  \    <p><b>Last but not least: if you had only 30 seconds to convince someone to\
  \ read this particular novel, what would your pitch be?</b><br> Want to read a fun\
  \ adventure yarn where magic isn't center stage, but realistic people who verbally\
  \ spar a lot are? Want to meet a lot of unpleasant people and see them get killed\
  \ or at least taste comeuppances? Want to read a swords &amp; sorcery book written\
  \ with humor? Want to read the unlikeliest of \"buddy\" novels? Ever wanted to see\
  \ a female halfling star in a fantasy novel? Then read <i>The Wizard's Mask</i>!</p>\
