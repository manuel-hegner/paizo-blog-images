  description\">G'day! We've just unleashed <em><a href=\"/products/btq01w1y?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Wilderness-Origins\"\
  >Pathfinder Player Companion: Wilderness Origins</a></em> and if you follow me,\
  \ we can take a look at this beautiful volume as it hits bookshelves and the digital\
  \ downloads of paizo.com as a PDF. Now be careful as we take a peek inside!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Now, the first thing you need to know about this book is that serves\
  \ as a companion to <i><a href=\"/products/btpy9ujo?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Ultimate-Wilderness\"\
  >Ultimate Wilderness</a></i>. This book is your go-to source to expand on the content\
  \ from <i>Ultimate Wilderness</i> with new archetypes, feats, magic items, and so\
  \ much more. Shifters can look forward to new animal aspects, like the boar and\
  \ octopus aspects, new feats that allow you to apply a weapon's properties to your\
  \ shifter claws, and even a new system to replace your claw attacks with alternate\
  \ attack types, like bites, gores, and talons. Shifters looking to expand beyond\
  \ the animal kingdom can make use of specialized archetypes like the swarm shifter,\
  \ which eventually allows the shifter to become several swarms of vermin at once!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Players using the new races from <em>Ultimate Wilderness</em> can look\
  \ forward to lots of options as well. Each of the three races receive new alternate\
  \ racial traits to allow for further customization of these natural heroes. Gathlains\
  \ can take feats that allow them meld with trees or call treants to their sides.\
  \ Ghorans can harness the power of petals floating on the wind to create showers\
  \ of blossoms that allow them to hide from their enemies. Vine leshys can extend\
  \ their verdant natures to others, creating explosive growths that aid their allies!</p>\

  >\n     <br><i>Illustration by Beatrice Pelagatti</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>In addition\
  \ to all of the options for these characters, we give a lot of love to our furry\
  \ and scaly friends with new options for animal companions and familiars. Among\
  \ these are several new archetypes. Some of my favorites include the apex species\
  \ archetype for animal companions, which empowers your animal companion to gain\
  \ extra abilities while in its home habitat, and the parasite archetype for familiars,\
  \ which allows your familiar to attach itself to your foes and attempt to take them\
  \ over! We also have lots of new feats for your companions and familiars and an\
  \ expanded list of available animal companions for cavaliers, paladins, and rangers.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Other characters that are looking to tap into the power of the wilderness\
  \ have plenty of options to look forward to in this book. Among these are several\
  \ new magic flowers, spells that call upon the might of natural disasters, and other\
  \ class abilities that tap into the power of nature such as new arcanist exploits,\
  \ barbarian rage powers, kineticist talents, and witch hexes. Whether you're just\
  \ roughing it or have become one with nature, make sure to check out <em>Pathfinder\
  \ Player Companion: Wilderness Origins</em>!</p> \n    <p>Luis Loza<br> <i>Developer</i></p>\
