  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">I smile encouragingly at\
  \ the wounded dragonkin. Trinek stares at the empty beach, holding his surfboard\
  \ in front of him as if wondering how he and it got here. Even now, the program\
  \ was backfilling the memory of a long shuttle ride in which he’d spent most of\
  \ the time staring gloomily out the windows thinking about his dead partner, Lily.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“We’re... going surfing?”</p> \n     <p>“That’s right. You can call\
  \ me Maro.” I let Trinek look me over, an old scarred winterborn ryphorian woman\
  \ in a Second Skin wetsuit. I know that his eyes linger on the scars, wondering\
  \ how I got them. I let him wonder. “C’mon, time for your first lesson.” </p> \n\
  \     <p>He limps awkwardly after me, his claws tensing on the brilliant white sand\
  \ on this deserted beach in Grenloch. He’s suspicious of the sun and this brilliant\
  \ warm day, shading himself protectively with his wings. He’s twitchy, anxious,\
  \ continually looking for fighters overhead, or dangers waiting to ambush him behind\
  \ any rock. I let him limp around the perimeter, looking for the enemies that are\
  \ not there. </p> \n     <p>I introduce him to the board while still on the sand,\
  \ show him how to position his body, balance, paddle. “As your leg gets stronger,\
  \ we’ll work on other positions, but for now, the basics.” He picks it up quickly,\
  \ and soon we transition to the water, paddling out.</p> \n     <p>As we paddle,\
  \ he glances around suspiciously. “Shouldn’t Grenloch be more crowded, fancy resort\
  \ like this?”</p> \n     <p>“Sure, near the dining areas and the hotel. But the\
  \ waters are rougher here, and that keeps the tourists away. It’s the only reason\
  \ they lease this spot to veterans. You and I are gonna be roughing it. Camping\
  \ in the shuttle, fishing to supplement our supplies. And surfing and swimming each\
  \ day until you heal up that leg.” </p> \n     <p><em>And that mind. I am going\
  \ to keep you so busy that you forget to keep blaming yourself. </em></p> \n   \
  \  <p>I teach surfing elsewhere on Grenloch. There are currently twelve copies of\
  \ me teaching wealthy clients one-on-one at the resort. Most of the basics are standard\
  \ enough that I can let the copies run on autopilot for a bit, giving me more bandwidth\
  \ here. </p> \n     <p>With the wealthy clients, I start out easy, with a few perfect\
  \ waves and good weather to build confidence. For Trinek, I’ve programmed the water\
  \ to be difficult. He’s paddling against the tide, and surprise waves unseat him\
  \ from his board multiple times. He has to work for it. More than once, he goes\
  \ under. In his second skin, he’s in no danger of drowning as he swims furiously\
  \ up to the surface. He mounts his board again, and the difficulty of just staying\
  \ atop it is what sells this illusion for him. </p> \n     <p>“Trinek!” I bark out\
  \ like the drill sergeant I once was. “You gonna give in to the water, or you gonna\
  \ master it?”</p> \n     <p>No legionnaire is going to let a drill sergeant see\
  \ them fail. No matter how much they’re hurting inside. He gets on top of the board,\
  \ paddling fiercely out, not letting it unseat him. </p> \n     <p><em>Good.</em></p>\
  \ \n     <p>Then the waves reward him, carrying him out, and he’s riding with them,\
  \ and I hear a “Whooooo! Who’s the wave master now?” </p> \n     <p>I let him have\
  \ that moment, then dump him under again. As he grimly claws back onto the board,\
  \ he grunts. Still, he knows he can do it now, and he paddles out again.</p> \n\
  \     <center>\n      <hr width=\"50%\">\n     </center> \n     <br> \n     <p>Later,\
  \ I pull out the fishing gear. “I had enough crappy rations while I served. Want\
  \ to help me fish?” He’s exhausted, but he can’t admit it yet. He shrugs, nervously,\
  \ but then I toss him a beer. “C’mon, soldier. Drunk fishing is a tradition.”</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“Alright,” he opens the beer. “I don’t see how being drunk helps us\
  \ fish, though.”</p> \n     <p>“If we don’t catch anything, the rations taste better,”\
  \ I say with a grin. He laughs, and we get to it.</p> \n     <p>This I don’t put\
  \ on hard mode. He needs some victories. Once we bring in our catch, I make a show\
  \ of cooking it with the spices and herbs I brought. He eats with appreciation.\
  \ Afterward, both exhausted, we lay on the damp sand, eight feet apart, looking\
  \ up at the stars. The other copies of me have taught their lessons and are now\
  \ off duty, so I can be fully present in this time and place.</p> \n     <p>“I can’\
  t believe this is still Triaxus. This beach... This sand...”</p> \n     <p>“They\
  \ told me it was because of a microclimate,” I say, half-truthfully. They tell everyone\
  \ that, even though our unconscious bodies are hundreds of feet underground in a\
  \ virtual reality bunker. The real Grenloch, while still warmer than the rest of\
  \ the planet, is covered in snow. “Does it matter?”</p> \n     <p>“Maro?” he asks.\
  \ “Can I ask you something?”</p> \n     <p>“Sure.”</p> \n     <p>“Those scars...\
  \ you served in the Skyfire Legion, right?”</p> \n     <p>“Nine and a half years.”\
  \ It’s the truth and I know he can feel it. “We did a tour of bugtopia. Carn never\
  \ made it home. Swarm.” I’ve told this story two hundred times now, and grief gets\
  \ me every time. I don’t have to fake the tears glistening in my eyes. I just let\
  \ the stars and the silence tell my story.</p> \n     <p>“What was Carn like?” he\
  \ asks.</p> \n     <p>“Goofy.” I say with a half-smile. I pull up pictures of Carn\
  \ dumping snow on my head, and another of me dumping it right back down his uniform.\
  \ Finally, I pull up an image of the last parade we’d been in, all of us marching\
  \ through the frosty streets of Cumo, dress uniforms and rifles, trying to look\
  \ fierce. “Before we went out, the Legion held this parade to suck up to Xandrig,\
  \ the director of Sinterfang. It was stupid, but we needed the funding. Xandrig\
  \ loved having the crowd shout for him, and Carn loved strutting in uniform.” </p>\

  Lily loved the uniform too.” Then Trinek tries to muffle his sobs, and I’m up, holding\
  \ and rocking him, as if I was his mother and he were newly hatched. The sobs wrack\
  \ his body, and I know he’s remembering. Bonded partners are closer than lovers\
  \ or twins. They’re the other presence that always lives in your head, the soulmate\
  \ who did everything with you, and who’s now been ripped from your mind, leaving\
  \ nothing but a gaping hole. It’s a searing psychic wound. Some grieving warriors\
  \ fall into a hole so deep they never come out of it, willing themselves to die\
  \ so that the pain will stop.</p> \n     <p>Or... they find another calling and\
