  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">With year-end fast approaching,\
  \ I enjoy taking a moment to reflect on everything that happened the prior year\
  \ and put some broad strokes in place for the future. It doesn’t feel like twelve\
  \ months since we did the last review, but you know the saying – “Time flies when\
  \ you’re having fun!” This time around, I asked the other Organized Play team members\
  \ to give their thoughts as well. You can find their musings a bit further down\
  \ the page. Thurston Hillman, Starfinder Society Developer, didn’t send me one,\
  \ so the next time you see him, be sure to ask about his 2019! </p> \n     <p>For\
  \ me, this was the third year of major program releases. In 2017, we spun up Starfinder\
  \ Society. Besides ramping up Starfinder Society to full production in 2018, we\
  \ launched the Pathfinder Playtest, which had some significant Society components,\
  \ and gathered information about the status of Organized Play and opinions of our\
  \ community. The launch of Pathfinder (second edition) in 2019 involved a complete\
  \ reboot of the Pathfinder Society, including some new programs, as well as a major\
  \ shake-up in our team membership. As far as 2020, I look forward to a year of settling\
  \ in and polishing our processes.</p> \n     <p>We still have wrinkles to work out\
  \ with several of the program changes, but I’m confident we can get to where we\
  \ need to be. Every day brings new challenges and experiences, but I wouldn’t have\
  \ it any other way. Four and one-third years in, I’m happy to be working with one\
  \ of the best team in Paizo and can’t wait to see what 2020 brings!</p> \n     <p>Next\
  \ week, we will have our first “Spotlights, Stars, and Cons” blog of 2020! Tune\
  \ in to see what our community’s been up to in December and our plans for 2020!</p>\

  25%\" align=\"right\" hspace=\"5\"></a> 2019 was a big year for the Pathfinder Adventure\
  \ Card Society (formerly known as the Pathfinder Adventure Card Guild). After plenty\
  \ of play experience and fan feedback, the designers of the Pathfinder Adventure\
  \ Card Game came out with a revised <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01ws7?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Core-Set\"\
  >Core Set</a>, as well as an expansion for the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01ws8?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Curse-of-the-Crimson-Throne-Adventure-Path\"\
  >Curse of the Crimson Throne</a> Adventure Path. These new boxes come with detailed\
  \ stories and plenty of customization, from ways to alter the difficulty of scenarios\
  \ to a full-on custom adventure builder. And as the organized play team looked what\
  \ the new set had to offer, we looked for ways that we could expand our offerings.\
  \ We realized—Pathfinder Society and Starfinder Society have a tradition of creating\
  \ ways for players to receive organized play credit for Paizo’s other adventures,\
  \ so why not the Pathfinder Adventure Card Society as well? So we opened these rules\
  \ up to organized play, including the custom adventure builder. We’ve also started\
  \ looking at releasing more short adventures, like the Season of the Kobolds that\
  \ came out at PaizoCon, and the multi-tiered standalone adventure A Night at Blackthorne\
  \ Manor that will be coming out next month. In terms of the main storyline, we closed\
  \ out the Year of Tapestry’s Tides at PaizoCon and then launched the Year of Rotting\
  \ Ruin at Gen Con. Tapestry’s Tides started with the PCs as vanguards in the RPG/card\
  \ game crossover special The Hao Jin Cataclysm; that is, until the PCs got pulled\
  \ into a dangerous pocket dimension.</p> \n     <p>One of the best parts about working\
  \ on stories for the Pathfinder Adventure Card Society is that it’s so much easier\
  \ to take the adventure into perilous or wacky locations. If you (hypothetically)\
  \ want to offer your players a chance to set aside their better judgement and <a\
  \ href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01x99?Pathfinder-Society-Adventure-Card-Guild-5P1-Titans-Rampage\"\
  >provoke the wrath of a kaiju</a>, you can. And that’s not even the most over-the-top\
  \ part of the season. Tapestry’s Tides was also a great chance to delve into more\
  \ Tian Xia lore, traveling to multiple locations that haven’t appeared in a previous\
  \ Paizo adventure. And when Tapestry’s Tides came to a close, we decided to run\
  \ with a massive story hook left in Tyrant’s Grasp, where that Adventure Path’s\
  \ PCs travel elsewhere and Pathfinder agents are among the heroes to battle the\
  \ terrors left behind in the undead-blighted Gravelands. </p> \n     <p>On the Pathfinder\
  \ Society side, my favorite projects that I’ve worked on are the twin finales to\
  \ the Pathfinder Society campaign in Pathfinder First Edition: The Passing the Torch\
  \ series for Tier 12-18 (<a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01yz0?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-1022-Passing-the-Torch-Part-1-Who-Wears-the-Mask\"\
  >Part 1: Who Wears the Mask</a> and <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01yz1?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-1023-Passing-the-Torch-Part-2-Who-Speaks-for-the-Ten\"\
  >Part 2: Who Speaks for the Ten</a>) and the Tier 5–16 interactive special <a href=\"\
  \" https: paizo.com store pathfinder society season10>#10-98: Siege of Gallowspire</a>.\
  \ I’ve been invested in the First Edition Pathfinder Society campaign since Season\
  \ 2, and it was a privilege to shape these capstone stories. We got the chance to\
  \ pay off plots years in the making. These scenarios are stories of destruction\
  \ and renewal, of meaningful choices. They gave us a chance to try out new ideas\
  \ that really only work in a campaign with the weight of years behind it, from super-high\
  \ level adventuring to mechanics that allow multiple PCs per player to work together\
  \ against overwhelming odds. </p> \n     <p>I could ramble on for a while about\
  \ how excited I am about Pathfinder Society in Second Edition, and about the Plans™\
  \ we’ve got cooking for Starfinder Society, but I should leave that to other folks\
  \ to keep this blog to a somewhat reasonable length. Before I go though, I’d like\
  \ to acknowledge the person who has been a bedrock member of the Organized Play\
  \ team for years, and who moved over to the Starfinder team after Gen Con: John\
  \ Compton. John has played a pivotal role in many of the improvements that you’\
  ve seen in our organized play campaigns in recent years. He taught me how to be\
  \ a developer and prepared me to take over as Organized Play Lead Developer when\
  \ he left. Though he has flown away to the stars, I’m confident that our team will\
  \ continue to flourish, and I’m excited to show you what we have in store for 2020!</p>\

  \ \n     <hr width=\"75%\"> \n     <p><i>Michael’s musings —</i><br>Is 2019 really\
  \ over? I feel like it’s mostly just a blur of text and art orders with the occasional\
  \ packed convention breaking things up! With rolling out a new edition and overhauling\
  \ just about every aspect of the Pathfinder Society campaign this year we’ve been\
  \ up to our elbows in development and meetings. Despite (because?) of all that,\
  \ it was a really good year and I’m happy about a lot of what we’ve accomplished.\
  \ If you’ve been following our Pathfinder Society quests and scenarios, you’ve probably\
  \ noticed that we’ve been constantly responding to the input from all of our GMs\
  \ and volunteer coordinators out there to introduce new convenience tools and refine\
  \ the tools we’ve been using. We’ve got a detailed list of where the treasures are\
  \ hidden for the GM to make sure players are getting everything they’ve earned,\
  \ new appendices to speed up encounter running, checkpoints sprinkled throughout\
  \ the adventures to remind GMs of when they should be giving out Hero Points, and\
  \ at least half a dozen other things that aren’t leaping to my mind right now in\
  \ these final minutes before I head out for a very long weekend.</p> <a href=\"\

  \ width=\"25%\" hspace=\"5\" align=\"right\"></a> \n     <p>It’s been my privilege\
  \ to see the PF2 adventures that authors new and old have brought to life based\
  \ on the outlines put together by this amazing organized play team, including some\
  \ personal favorites like our new org play developer James Case’s <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq021xi?Pathfinder-Society-Quest-4-Port-Peril-Pub-Crawl\"\
  >Port Peril Pub Crawl</a> and editor Leo Glass’s <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq0217m?Pathfinder-Society-Quest-2-Unforgiving-Fire\"\
  >Unforgiving Fire</a>, both of which are part of our new monthly quest line. I got\
  \ to see an NPC I helped shepherd into existence when I first started at Paizo take\
  \ center stage when Dolok Darkfur (who first debuted in <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy9zk2?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-918-Scourge-of-the-Farheavens\"\
  >Scourge of the Farheavens</a> by Jason Owen Black) appeared in our web fiction\
  \ story <a hred=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgoe?Tales-of-Lost-Omens-Far-From-Heaven\"\

  https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgiq?Meet-the-Iconics-Fumbus\">Fumbus</a>.\
  \ I’m realizing as I go through this list that I’m not even halfway through, so\
  \ leave it that my second year working for Paizo was filled with even more stories\
  \ and opportunities than my first.</p> \n     <p>This has been an awesome ride and\
  \ I really can’t tell you all how excited I am for what the next year is going to\
  \ bring. Tonya, Linda, James, Thursty and I have deep into not just getting the\
  \ rest of this season rolling towards the finish line, but also laying the groundwork\
  \ for some really cool stuff over the next two seasons of the Pathfinder Society\
  \ organized play program and beyond. Fair warning, I’m going to be responsible for\
  \ the deaths of some NPCs some of you are fond of. With any luck I’ll also be responsible\
  \ for introducing a few new ones you’ll like as well! The one thing I can guarantee\
  \ is that we’re going to keep trying new types of adventures and stories as we explore\
  \ the new opportunities created by the rules framework of Pathfinder second edition.\
  \ We’re going to build castles and defend them from undead hordes. We’re going to\
  \ slay dragons, travel to places no one in Paizo or the Pathfinder Society has ever\
  \ been, and we’re going to meet old friends and maybe a few old enemies who’ve been\
  \ dodging justice for awhile now. We’re going to have a lot of adventures, and I’\
  m close my piece by reiterating how awesome it is to share those adventures with\
  \ the amazing community of volunteers and fans who help us keep creating them. You’\
  re all awesome.</p> \n     <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold; line-height:\
