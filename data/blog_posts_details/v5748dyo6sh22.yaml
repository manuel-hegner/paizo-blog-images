  artist: "this amazing organized play team, including some personal favorites like\
    \ our new org play developer James Case’s Port Peril Pub Crawl and editor Leo\
    \ Glass’s Unforgiving Fire, both of which are part of our new monthly quest line.\
    \ I got to see an NPC I helped shepherd into existence when I first started at\
    \ Paizo take center stage when Dolok Darkfur (who first debuted in Scourge of\
    \ the Farheavens by Jason Owen Black) appeared in our web fiction story Far From\
    \ Heaven. I got to introduce the whole world to my good friend Fumbus. I’m realizing\
    \ as I go through this list that I’m not even halfway through, so leave it that\
    \ my second year working for Paizo was filled with even more stories and opportunities\
    \ than my first"
