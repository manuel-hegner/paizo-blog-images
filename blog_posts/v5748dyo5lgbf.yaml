  \ Accidental Hardcore</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Monday, July 21, 2014</p> \n \
  \  <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">As the\
  \ date for <a href=\"http://gencon.com\" target=\"_blank\">Gen Con</a> closes in,\
  \ everyone here at Paizo is still chugging away, making sure we're contributing\
  \ our fair share to the best four days in gaming. But as our annual pilgrimage to\
  \ Indianapolis gets closer, we often start wondering, \"What's it going to be this\
  \ year?\" As in, what's the one story—or, more likely, bunch of stories—we'll be\
  \ telling everyone upon our return home? Things happen at Gen Con that can only\
  \ happen at Gen Con, so there's always some unbelievable tale to tell. Dozens of\
  \ examples leap to mind, but, among those of which I haven't been sworn to secrecy,\
  \ I find myself constantly coming back to one story in particular from nearly a\
  \ decade ago.</span></p> \n    <p>In another life—one that was a lot like this one,\
  \ but far quieter—I helped make an awesome magazine. Occasionally, as part of that\
  \ business, wonderful people would send us wonderful things, either for review,\
  \ or by way of thanks, or simply because they thought we too were wonderful people.\
  \ As the editor in charge of news and previews, I held down the landing desk for\
  \ many significant parcels.</p> \n    <p>From the contents of one of those packages,\
  \ the staff of <i>Dragon</i> and <i>Dungeon</i> magazines wound up with preview\
  \ tickets to True Dungeon at Gen Con 2006.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb180\">\n\
  \     <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/20140721-TrueDungeon.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/20140721-TrueDungeon_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>If you don't know about the singular awesomeness that\
  \ is True Dungeon, <a href=\"http://truedungeon.com/\" target=\"_blank\">a deliberately\
  \ placed click can solve that</a>. As it stood, none of us had previously had the\
  \ pleasure of partaking in this immersive dungeon experience. The promise of what\
  \ we expected to be an intricate fantasy funhouse was more than enough to get the\
  \ entire crew signed on, but none of us had any actual idea of what lay in store.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>As it was, our tickets were for Wednesday night, only a narrow few hours\
  \ after landing in Indianapolis. Perhaps predictably, delays left us racing for\
  \ our evening reservation. We arrived before True Dungeon's faux stone gates with\
  \ whole seconds to spare and presented our hostess with our golden tickets, which\
  \ were, quite literally, golden. (Let it never be said that those True Dungeon folks\
  \ don't know a thing or two about ostentation.)</p> \n    <p>After giving us a generous\
  \ moment to catch our breaths (editors are sprinters, not distance runners), our\
  \ hostess sunnily asked if we were \"hardcore.\"</p> \n    <p>That was the point\
  \ when our bravado caught up with us: \"My friend, don't you know? <i>We</i> are\
  \ the creators of <i>Dragon</i> and <i>Dungeon</i> magazines. Few in gaming come\
  \ more hardcore.\" Confident nods—and one indulgently arched eyebrow—followed, and\
  \ that was that.</p> \n    <p>We received basic instructions about the sorts of\
  \ puzzles and dangers we'd soon face, along with a variety of character options,\
  \ equipment tokens, and other wonders I can't recall. Finally, our hostess handed\
  \ me a plastic ball and, giving it a solid knock, demonstrated that it lit up.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Lit up\" might actually be a bit of an overstatement for what it did.\
  \ Rather, think of the light shed by the screen of your classic 1989 Nintendo Game\
  \ Boy... when it was about 8 minutes from running out of batteries. Remember that\
  \ drowning electronic green? That. The ball did <i>that</i>.</p> \n    <p>So! \"\
  Light\" in hand, we marched through the convincing stone-board gates, ready to face\
  \ challenges none of us could anticipate...</p> \n    <p>Our psyches were left shattered\
  \ and our memories drained from what we encountered that day. Whether such psyche-obliterating\
  \ effects were the result of the horrifying dungeon-come-to-life itself or the binding\
  \ non-disclosure agreement we signed afterward, none are sure. All I can admit with\
  \ any certainty is that the dungeon's authenticity was like no other—right down\
  \ to the oppressive dimness that left us scouring encounter rooms for overlooked\
  \ clues and secrets hidden in the shapes of shadowy statues. And finally, against\
  \ not-inconsiderable odds and with acceptable loss of life, we emerged into a room\
  \ easily mistook for a trap chamber. It turned out to just be the discharging area.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Squinting against the light but knowing we were victorious, we gave our\
  \ accounting and returned our somehow-diminished light source to the attendant,\
  \ who held a plain cardboard box. The attendant looked somewhat surprised at our\
  \ faded glow-ball. \"Oh! You went hardcore!\"</p> \n    <p>There was that word again,\
  \ this time said like a term. \"Yes?\" we collectively acknowledged, realizing our\
  \ bravado was among the wounded.</p> \n    <p>\"Well that means you get these AMAZING\
  \ TREASURES instead!\" Our host extracted his hands from the common cardboard box\
  \ and reached into the container next to it, fishing our rewards from a platinum\
  \ chest trimmed in panda belly-fur and studded with the gems diamonds cry. Among\
  \ these were pins emblazoned with the True Dungeon logo and a stamp that read \"\
  Hardcore.\"</p> \n    <p>\"What does 'hardcore' mean?\" Fearless Leader Erik asked.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Our beaming host cocked his head. \"Didn't they...\" he began, but shrugged,\
  \ realizing he had the rapt attention of the thoroughly confused. \"It means you\
  \ don't get a torch.\"</p> \n    <p>Laughing, victorious, we walked out into the\
  \ steamy Indianapolis night—utterly despite ourselves—hardcore.</p> \n    <p>That's\
  \ exactly the sort of unlikely adventure that only happens at Gen Con.</p> \n  \
