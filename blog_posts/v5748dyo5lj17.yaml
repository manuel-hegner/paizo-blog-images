  \ \n    <p>Huge congratulations to the team of volunteers that worked diligently\
  \ through Gen Con. From Leads Bob Jonquet, Jon Cary, and Todd Morgan to Department\
  \ Heads Bobby Harring, Dominick Trascritti, Kevin Hanley, Lucas Servideo, Seth Brummond,\
  \ and Walter Sheppard to the hundreds of GMs and HQ volunteers. My deepest thanks\
  \ to everyone that contributed from set up to tear down to bring the show together.\
  \ There is no way to run an event the size of Gen Con without many hands. Thank\
  \ you to all who gave of their time so that others may play in the world's largest\
  \ organized play campaign!</p> \n    <h2>Campaign Coins</h2> \n    <p>It was my\
  \ immense pleasure to award a number of campaign coins at PaizoCon UK and Gen Con.\
  \ Each recipient spent hours of their time serving our campaign, giving of their\
  \ time and talents. As with the Gen Con volunteers, our campaign would not run without\
  \ their selflessness. A huge huzzah and congratulations to the following: </p>\n\

  ></a></p> \n    </div> \n    <h2>Order of the Wayfinder</h2> \n    <p>Several months\
  \ back, I wrote a blog on volunteerism and what the Campaign Coins meant to me.\
  \ Some of our most outstanding volunteers received their coins in prior years. Thus,\
  \ the formation of the Order of the Wayfinder, an award above the Campaign Coin\
  \ with which the Pathfinder Society team may recognize those volunteers whose service\
  \ goes above and beyond and without whom it would be impossible to run the Society.\
  \ The premier inductee of the Order is <strong>Bob Jonquet</strong>, whom I many\
  \ never thank enough for his tireless hours as Regional Venture Captain and Gen\
  \ Con lead. Any hour of the day, whatever the issue we need assistance with, he\
  \ is there to help and support. To Bob, our deepest thanks and appreciation. Congratulations!</p>\
  \ \n    <h2>Five Star GMs</h2> \n    <p>Several game masters reached their 5-star\
  \ milestone over the past few weeks. These GMs dedicate hours to the game, running\
  \ 150 sessions, 50 of which must be different scenarios, and 10 special events.\
  \ The time commitment that goes into preparing and delivering games deserves a cheer\
  \ and a round of applause! </p>\n    <ul> \n     <li>Paul Crotteau</li> \n     <li>Adam\
  \ Loutzenhiser</li> \n     <li>Bill Tobin</li> \n     <li>Henry Chi</li> \n    \

  \    <h2>Guide Revisions</h2> \n    <div class=\"blurb180\" style=\"float: left;\"\
  > \n     <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PFS-StolenStorm_180.jpeg\"\
  > \n    </div> \n    <p>As many of you who read the <a href=\"/products/btpy84k4\"\
  \ target=\"_new\">new Roleplaying Guild Guide</a> noticed, the formatting changed\
  \ quite a bit, and a few new rules found their way in as well. These new rules received\
  \ mixed reviews, and specifically, applying credit from playing a pregenerated character.\
  \ As with other initiatives and programs, I am open to feedback on how they work\
  \ in the field, and as with other initiatives, I will revisit them in six months\
  \ to see how they are working. Constructive feedback based on observation will help\
  \ us the most, and we know that not all of our decisions will please everybody,\
  \ but this was an issue that needed addressing.</p> \n    <p>Another change in the\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy84k4\" target=\"_new\">Roleplaying Guild Guide</a> involves\
  \ the Pathfinder Society Community Policy. The goal of the policy is to create an\
  \ inclusive environment for our players while leaving options open for communities\
  \ to have the flavor of Pathfinder Society that they desire. The new policy puts\
  \ the burden of good behavior on each individual player, with consequences for players\
  \ not interested in fostering a community spirit. It also puts weight on the GM\
  \ to regulate the table and ensure that no one is being excluded from play. So if\
  \ you want to play edgier concepts, recognize the time and place for them. A public\
  \ venue with new players may not be the right time to bring out the man-hating cleric\
  \ of Calistra, elf supremacist, or Zarta Dralneen's newest enthusiast—save those\
  \ characters for a private game with people you know. \"My character would act that\
  \ way\" is not an excuse to abuse other Pathfinders, and when choosing which character\
  \ to play, consider your environment and the other players at your table and select\
  \ appropriately.</p> \n    <p>With the inclusion of a more defined community behavior\
  \ policy, we are rescinding the limitation on slaver and torturer professions. This\
  \ does not lift the restriction on Pathfinders purchasing slaves. The reason for\
  \ this inclusion in the campaign is that they are an ingrained part of the economy\
  \ (slaver) and religious observance for Kuthonites (torturer). Again, as with other\
  \ changes to the campaign, please send feedback and let me know how this is working\
  \ in your area. If it becomes evident players are not able to have this content\
  \ and treat it in a responsible manner, then it will once again be removed and offending\
  \ players subject to disciplinary action.</p> <a href=\"http://west.paxsite.com/\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\"><h2>PAX West</h2></a> \n    <p>If you're in the Seattle area\
  \ over the Labor Day weekend and attending the show on September 2nd to 5th, please\
  \ stop by and say hi! And if you'd like to volunteer for us at the show for either\
  \ the Roleplaying Game Guild or the Adventure Card Guild, send me an email and I\
  \ will pass it onto the leads (Louis Manko Levite or Stacey Buxton).</p> \n    <p>I\
  \ hope everyone is getting a chance to wrap up <a href=\"/pathfinderSocietyScenarios/season7\"\
  >Year of the Serpent</a> and get ready to ride the tempest that is <a href=\"/pathfinderSocietyScenarios/season8\"\
  >Year of the Stolen Storm</a>!</p> \n    <p>Until next week—explore, report, cooperate!</p>\
