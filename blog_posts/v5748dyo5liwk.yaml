  \ target=\"_blank\">Gen Con Indy</a>, draws ever nearer, so Linda and I are industriously\
  \ preparing the huge swath of new adventures leading up to and kicking off the new\
  \ Season 8: Year of the Stolen Storm. Back when I was first pitching the new <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy9k93\"><em>All for Immortality</em></a> seeker arc, adding\
  \ two extra adventures onto the end of the season seemed quite reasonable. Now that\
  \ Linda and I are in the thick of developing (and writing) these adventures, we\
  \ sometimes have that moment where we rock back and forth slightly while giggling\
  \ madly anytime someone asks how things are coming along. I like to explain that\
  \ we're laughing about the cruel creativity of this month's authors, who have crafted\
  \ some delightful stories, encounters, and NPCs. Once you see what's coming out\
  \ this month, I think you'll agree.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\" style=\"width:380px;\"\

  \ in Season 5, I realized that the Pathfinder Society hadn't traveled to the Mwangi\
  \ Expanse in earnest for many years, so I set aside some space in Season 6 to explore\
  \ this region. We got to adventure in the cities of Bloodcove and Nantambu as well\
  \ as experience the diverse environments along the Sargavan border, and the feedback\
  \ we received was very positive. Folks wanted to see more of Nantambu, and there\
  \ was a lot of interest in seeing more of the Mwangi Expanse—especially another\
  \ adventure with some pulp \"exploring the unknown\" elements. I contacted <a href=\"\
  /pathfinderSociety/getInvolved#opencall\">Pathfinder Society Open Call</a> and <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy9fi8\"><em>Phantom Phenomena</em></a> author Brian Duckwitz\
  \ to write this month's <a href=\"/products/btpy9lzz\"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario\
  \ #7-24: Dead Man's Debt</em></a> and apply his flair for wilderness encounters\
  \ to the ongoing developments around Nantambu's Pathfinder lodge. In this Tier 1-5\
  \ adventure, the PCs head deep into the jungle to uphold the Pathfinder Society's\
  \ honor, and in the process they'll have a great opportunity to observe the Ekujae\
  \ elves' culture—perhaps at spearpoint!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb180\" style=\"\

  \ 6 also saw a major overhaul of the PC factions as each of the \"national\" factions\
  \ gravitated toward more philosophical goals. When the Cheliax faction evolved into\
  \ the Dark Archive, several players were concerned that without a Chelish connection,\
  \ their Hellknight PCs would no longer be relevant in the Pathfinder Society. The\
  \ short answer is that Hellknight PCs are still welcome so long as they honor the\
  \ Society's principles. The slightly longer answer is that Hellknights are a rather\
  \ charming organization because their interest in opposing or collaborating with\
  \ the Society depends a lot on context. Much as I tried to express that Hellknights\
  \ don't need a Cheliax faction, I knew the best way to demonstrate that would be\
  \ in a scenario. The basic premise for <a href=\"/products/btpy9m00\"><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Society Scenario #7-25: Orders from the Gate</em></a> has been floating in my\
  \ head for some time, and only recently did I identify both the right Tier 5-9 slot\
  \ and the right author. Cole Kronewitter is another Open Call veteran and <em>Phantom\
  \ Phenomena</em> author who really distinguished himself for his atmospheric descriptions,\
  \ dialogue, and use of the setting, and for this adventure he consistently wowed\
  \ us with his increasingly creepy and flavorful encounter design. The PCs get to\
  \ work with the Order of the Gate Hellknights in order to stop a common foe, and\
  \ over the course of the scenario, they may also find common ground with these allies.\
  \ For those of you who asked for a fun \"law vs. chaos\" adventure, dig in! Not\
  \ sure why you should be as excited about Hellknights as we are? Check out <a href=\"\
  /paizo/blog/v5748dyo5liuu\">this preview</a> for this month's <a href=\"/products/btpy9ipr\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Path of the Hellknight</em></a>!</p> \n    <p>In\
  \ April, contributor Thurston Hillman kicked off the first dedicated seeker-level\
  \ content in five years with <a href=\"/products/btpy9k93\"><em>Pathfinder Society\
  \ Scenario #7-20: All for Immortality, Part 1: First Taste of Eternity</em></a>.\
  \ The recent troubles in Thuvia have pointed to a mastermind in Nidal who conducts\
  \ otherworldly research in her hidden laboratories. In this month's <a href=\"/products/btpy9m01\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #7-26: All for Immortality, Part 2: All the Gods\
  \ Beyond</em></a>, editor-in-chief F. Wesley Schneider and developer Amanda Hamon\
  \ Kunz have teamed up to deliver a Tier 12-15 terror (complete with a bruising,\
  \ just-for-bragging-rights hard mode option). I hesitate to share too much and spoil\
  \ the adventure, so I'll just encourage you to dust off those high-level characters\
  \ and play!</p> \n    <h2>Pathfinder Society Character Sketch Competition Winner!</h2>\
  \ \n    <p>Congratulations and the prize of $30 in paizo.com store credit goes to\
  \ <a href=\"/people/FemmeFataleDAvignon\">Femme Fatale d'Avignon</a>, who submitted\
  \ an illustration of their character \"Phaedra Lingalare\"! Our two runners up Crescentmoon\

  \ brilliant sketches! Be sure to take another look at <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5livv\"\

  \    <h2>Gen Con Update</h2> \n    <p>Although tickets went quickly for <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9mbe\">our upcoming interactive event</a>, there are still open seats\
  \ for Thursday night's special <a href=\"/products/btpy9lzy\"><em>Serpents' Ire</em></a>\
  \ and Saturday night's special <a href=\"/products/btpy9mbd\"><em>Through Maelstrom\
  \ Rift</em></a>. In <em>Serpents' Ire</em>, you depict cutthroat agents dispatched\
  \ to learn who's stealing from the Aspis Consortium and shut down their operation—\
  permanently. This continues the behind-the-scenes story of the Consortium and its\
  \ rising stars and gives players another chance to exercise their darker side as\
  \ they uncover serious secrets all but unknown to the Aspis leadership.</p> \n \
  \   <p>You may have heard that in <em>Through Maelstrom Rift</em>, the players portray\
  \ elemental guardians who seek to preserve the balance of the planes, but so far\
  \ we haven't talked about the characters. In the Aspis Consortium adventures, the\
  \ players have portrayed humans scallywags, elven experiments, and even the occasional\
  \ monstrous humanoid or worse. In traveling to the Plane of Air, though, Linda's\
  \ had a chance to ditch Core Rulebook races altogether. We figured that this might\
  \ be a good opportunity to introduce you to the smallest member of the team, an\
  \ aspiring bard with the bravery of a warrior three size categories larger than\
  \ she. Can you really say no to a face like that? Neither can I, which is why I\
  \ encourage you to head over to the <a href=\"https://www.gencon.com/events/97558\"\
