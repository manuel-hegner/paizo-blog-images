  \ wanted to use this space to let the Paizo editorial team (developers, designers,\
  \ editors, and art team) share some of our favorite things that we made or did during\
  \ 2018. When asking the team for contributions to the blog, I received so many that\
  \ we're going to break this blog into two parts, with the second part dropping next\
  \ Friday.</p> \n    <p>Thanks to Sonja and Emily on the art team for selecting the\
  \ accompanying art, and thanks to all of you out there that have supported us in\
  \ our endeavors. Happy Holidays!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a\

  \     <h3>James Jacobs (Pathfinder Creative Director)</h3> \n     <p>It's been a\
  \ strange year, with the Pathfinder Playtest causing all sorts of excitement and\
  \ shenanigans both in and out of the office. And while there's a lot of amazing\
  \ products coming soon (the ones I'm most excited about haven't even been announced\
  \ yet, and I'm plenty excited about the ones we HAVE announced!), it's comforting\
  \ to know that the more things change, the more things stay the same. The thing\
  \ I'm the most proud about this year that I've done for Paizo is the <a href=\"\
  /products/btpya21b?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Sandpoint-Light-of-the-Lost-Coast\"\
  ><i>Sandpoint, Light of the Lost Coast</i></a> book. My original outline for this\
  \ book was having trouble getting in everything I wanted to say in 320 pages, and\
  \ in a weird way shrinking it down to 96 pages helped me focus on the heart of the\
  \ content (while simultaneously keeping a big chunk of it on the proverbial back\
  \ burner, hopefully, for something in the future!) and get it done in time to be\
  \ one of the final 1st edition products. Of course, the bulk of the book's information\
  \ is just as viable in 2nd edition or whatever version of whatever RPG you prefer\
  \ to run your adventures in! It's actually kinda tough for me to pick my favorite\
  \ part of my favorite book of the year. Between things like the Shroud and the Red\
  \ Bishop and Kanker and new art of Ameiko and that rhyme about the Mutterer and\
  \ so much more, though, my favorite is the amazing piece of art by Roberto Pitturru\
  \ who opens up the book—a beautiful shot of the town of Sandpoint itself! Thankfully\
  \ it wasn't a shot of the city on one of its many foggy days!</p> \n     <h3>Ron\
  \ Lundeen (Developer)</h3> \n     <p>So much for my first year! It's gone by in\
  \ a whirlwind of encounter design, art ordering, math balancing, and world building.\
  \ My favorite work, by far, is adventure development for the <a href=\"/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/theTyrantsGrasp\"\
  >Tyrant's Grasp Adventure Path</a>. I love sending out the first edition with a\
  \ bang! I wrote the first adventure for Tyrant's Grasp and turned it in to Crystal\
  \ early in 2018, without realizing that developing it would be the last thing Crystal\
  \ did before she departed and handed the rest of the AP over to me. She'd left me\
  \ with her carefully structured outline and some absolutely stellar freelance authors,\
  \ whose work I've been delighted to develop these past couple of months. And I get\
  \ to share it with you all in the new year!</p> \n     <h3>Jason Tondro (Editor)</h3>\
  \ \n     <p>This has been a big year for me. I only arrived at Paizo in March, when\
  \ the whole editorial team was working overtime to get the playtest rules, bestiary,\
  \ and adventure out to all of you in time for Gen Con. Holding those books in my\
  \ hand was an incredible feeling. But since then, I've also written 60,000 words\
  \ for Paizo in my night job as a freelancer! I started by writing <i>Assault on\
  \ the Crucible</i>, the climax of the <a href=\"/store/starfinder/adventurePath/dawnofFLame\"\
  >Dawn of Flame Adventure Path</a>, and have also contributed articles and monsters\
  \ to the back matter of Starfinder Adventure Paths, written an organized play adventure,\
  \ and contributed to several other projects that haven't even been announced yet.\
  \ And I've got even bigger stuff in the works! So as exciting as this year has been,\
  \ I have to admit that 2019 is looking even better, as all the stuff I've been writing\
  \ this year finally gets out into the world where all of you can play it. Happy\
  \ holidays, everyone.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb360\">\n      <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20181221-ModifiedMaintenanceBot.jpg\"\

  \ \n     <h3>Owen K.C. Stephens (Starfinder Design Lead)</h3> \n     <p>This was\
  \ an amazing year for me professionally, with so many things I could pick as a favorite.\
  \ Starfinder turned a year old, and we launched our first class playtest for it.\
  \ My first Adventure Path adventure, <a href=\"/products/btpya1ai?Starfinder-Adventure-Path-6-Empire-of-Bones\"\
  ><i>Empire of Bones</i></a> was released. I got kanabo into <a href=\"/products/btpya20r?Starfinder-Alien-Archive-2\"\
  ><i>Alien Archive 2</i></a>. In most years, any one of those things could easily\
  \ rank as my favorite. But this year, they all fall short of my very favorite thing.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Wonder grenades.</p> \n     <p>They're in <a href=\"/products/btpya1rr?Starfinder-Armory\"\
  ><i>Starfinder Armory</i></a>, on page 127. I didn't write them, develop them, or\
  \ edit them.</p> \n     <p>But I invented the idea.</p> \n     <p>At my Into the\
  \ Emerald Star Spire events at PaizoCon in 2017, before the <a href=\"/products/btpy9ssr?Starfinder-Core-Rulebook\"\
  ><i>Starfinder Core Rulebook</i></a> was released, I was converting Pathfinder rules\
  \ to Starfinder on-the-fly as I ran the game. I needed to replace some scrolls with\
  \ something, and I wanted it to be more interesting than just spell gems. I knew\
  \ I wanted it to be something that screamed \"science-fantasy,\" something you'd\
  \ never run into in a standard fantasy game or pure science-fiction setting. But\
  \ as the players got the cache, I still hadn't decided what to use. I opened my\
  \ mouth, prepared to just give them one-shot spell gems.</p> \n     <p>\"They're\
  \ grenades of wonder,\" I said, much to my own surprise.</p> \n     <p>\"They're\
  \ WHAT?!\"</p> \n     <p>One-shot rod of wonder effects, I explained. Totally random.\
  \ Illegal on many worlds. Pull the pin, throw, and no telling what'll happen.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The players loved them.</p> \n     <p>When I told the story to then-Creative\
  \ Director James Sutter, he loved them. When I later told the new Creative Director,\
  \ Robert G. McCreary, he loved them.</p> \n     <p>So they were added to the Armory\
  \ outline. And I managed to avoid having anything to do with them, so when the wonder\
  \ grenades came out in the print book, they got to be new to me all over again.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>And that's my favorite thing of the year.</p> \n     <h3>Mark Seifter\
  \ (Designer)</h3> \n     <p>This year was all about Pathfinder 2nd Edition for me.\
  \ It was exhilarating, terrifying, gratifying, an entire whirlwind of emotions to\
  \ create this new game, working not only with the design team and the rest of the\
  \ creative staff at Paizo but also with thousands of fans through the open playtest.\
  \ The game has improved by leaps and bounds thanks to the dedication and keen insight\
  \ of our playtesters and our many sleepless nights and weekends of hard work.</p>\

  \  <h3>Logan Bonner (Designer)</h3> \n     <p>Oh, man. What a year! Early in the\
  \ year, we were sending the first step toward a new edition to the printer, and\
  \ that was somehow the easy part! Once the Pathfinder Playtest came out, we got\
  \ to see all sorts of opinions and data, positive and negative. And getting to watch\
  \ so many people play the same adventure was so rewarding! This year has been all\
  \ about collecting fan impressions and surveys, putting together streams so you\
  \ could watch us play the Playtest, and doing demos at conventions. It's a lot of\
  \ playtesting in a relatively short time—including actual, difficult stress testing—\
  and we appreciate every one of you for taking the ride along with us. Everything\
  \ we learned goes into a set of changes that's going to make the final game incredible.\
  \ We're implementing changes as big as altering the whole proficiency system to\
  \ making minor tweaks to the <i>prestidigitation</i> spell, all due to what you\
  \ out there (and those of us in the office) found as you played and read the book.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>My first personal highlight for the year was seeing data from surveys.\
  \ We rarely get a chance to see how people are actually playing at home. Being able\
  \ to see what people thought separated out from the noise of a messageboard conversation\
  \ is something we haven't really had for previous playtests. Putting the surveys\
  \ together took a lot of work, but has paid off.</p> \n     <p>My second personal\
  \ highlight was going to PaizoCon UK in Birmingham. What a delightful, welcoming\
  \ group of people and a fun convention! I had so many great conversations and played\
  \ and ran delightful games.</p> \n     <p>Things haven't slowed down around the\
  \ office, and we're hard at work polishing the final version of the game. We, and\
  \ Pathfinder 2nd edition, will see you next year!</p> \n     <h3>Lyz Lydell (Editor)</h3>\
  \ \n     <p>In 2018, I wrote my first <a href=\"/store/pathfinder/pathfinderSociety/pfsrpg/scenarios\"\
  >Pathfinder Society Scenario</a>, and it was a pretty big undertaking: resolving\
  \ the metaplot for a longstanding and complicated faction leader in a Tier 7-11\
  \ scenario! <a href=\"/products/btpy9zk4?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-920-Fury-of-the-Final-Blade\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Society Scenario 9-20: Fury of the Final Blade</i></a> released right\
  \ before PaizoCon. One night at the con, I happened across a table of GMs playing\
  \ it and stopped by to watch for a while—without telling them I had written it.\
  \ It let me see folks who have tons of experience with Pathfinder Society interact\
  \ with the challenges and opponents I had built, and I was able to see them respond\
  \ in a totally genuine way. Seeing their reactions when a certain monster showed\
  \ up was absolutely priceless! I paraphrase: \"<i>Whaaaaaaaat!?</i>\" But even better\
  \ was the next morning, when several of them came to find me—having learned that\
  \ the quiet observer was actually the author—and let me know how much they had enjoyed\
  \ the whole thing. I never thought I'd see people engaging with things I created\
  \ like this, and knowing I've made a few lasting marks on Golarion.</p> \n     <h3>Stephen\
  \ Radney-MacFarland (Senior Designer)</h3> \n     <p>It's been a whirlwind of a\
  \ year. Not only did the Pathfinder Playtest see the light of day and created a\
  \ ton of feedback (and even more work), this year saw the launch of the Flip-Tiles\
  \ products. This is a project I had wanted to do for a few years now, and in short\
  \ order, we saw three base sets and a couple of expansion, which much, much more\
  \ to come. Then there was and my contribution to the Starfinder <a href=\"/store/starfinder/adventurePath/deadSuns\"\
  >Dead Suns Adventure Path</a>, <a href=\"/products/btpya0fe?Starfinder-Adventure-Path-5-The-Thirteenth-Gate\"\
  ><i>The Thirteenth Gate</i></a>, which I'm happy to hear folks are enjoying. In\
  \ between, I worked seven conventions, ran more games of Pathfinder Playtest than\
  \ I can remember, did a whole bunch of podcasts, and ran a session of the Pathfinder\
  \ Playtest over at Penny Arcade for their Club PA members. That one was particularly\
  \ enjoyable, as I reskinned the Beginner Box adventure (swapping goblins with kobolds\
  \ and the black dragon with a red one) and ran the entire adventure in a little\
  \ over four hours. Not bad considering one player had never played an RPG before\
  \ and none of the other players had much Pathfinder experience. On a more personal\
  \ note, my lovely girlfriend, Beth, bought me a special birthday present this year:\
  \ Wayne Reynold's original art for the background cover of my <a href=\"/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/hellsVengeance\"\
  >Hell's Vengeance Adventure Path</a> volume, <a href=\"/products/btpy9l3b?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-106-For-Queen-Empire\"\
  ><i>For Queen &amp; Empire</i></a>. All in all, a pretty good year. Yep. Pretty,\
  \ pretty good.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb360\">\n      <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20181221-HaoJinTapestry.jpeg\"\

  \ </div> \n     <h3>Patrick Renie (Developer)</h3> \n     <p>One of my favorite\
  \ parts of being a Pathfinder developer is writing requests for new art assets.\
  \ Devising the physical details of an NPC or new monster, working with our talented\
  \ art staff, and seeing what our amazing artists come up with never gets old. The\
  \ art that comes in is inevitably even better than I could envision, and these illustrations\
  \ really add another dimension to the stories we write for the Pathfinder world.\
  \ Sometimes the art we receive is so vividly and imaginatively rendered that we\
  \ rewrite whole chunks of the subject in question to better suit the art (rather\
  \ than asking the artist to adjust the art to match the text). It's a uniquely synergistic\
  \ craft that's as much a challenge as a joy to take part in.</p> \n     <h3>Eleanor\
  \ Ferron (Developer)</h3> \n     <p>Ever since I started working at Paizo in January\
  \ of this year, Luis and I have had the bittersweet honor of developing the final\
  \ Pathfinder 1e Campaign Settings and Player Companions, doing our best to give\
  \ the edition the best sendoff we could. It was a fun, if challenging, exercise\
  \ to ensure every book would have fresh and exciting material for both players and\
  \ GMs, and I'm hoping they will inspire fun new characters and campaigns going forward.\
  \ But the things I am proudest of have to go to Starfinder, where I not only got\
  \ to write the showstopper <a href=\"/products/btpy9zjx?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-114-Star-Sugar-Heartlove\"\
  ><i>Starfinder Scenario #1-14: Star Sugar Heartlove!!!</i></a> but also my very\
  \ first adventure path volume, <i><a href=\"/products/btpya205?Starfinder-Adventure-Path-8-Escape-from-the-Prison-Moon\"\
  >Starfinder Adventure Path #8: Escape from the Prison Moon</a></i>.</p> \n     <h3>John\
  \ Compton (Organized Play Lead Developer)</h3> \n     <p>Although I've had an active\
  \ hand in developing slightly fewer scenarios as the organized play team expands,\
  \ I've had a blast working on a bunch of these. One that really captured my imagination\
  \ was <a href=\"/products/btq01vpf?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-1008-What-Prestige-is-Worth\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Society Scenario #10-08: The Cost of Prestige</i></a> by Matt Duval,\
  \ which is a deep dive into Hell's politics and the city of Dis. Showing that the\
  \ outer planes—including the evil-aligned ones—are functional albeit dangerous societies\
  \ is really fun for me, and Matt did a great job with this one. Just be warned that\
  \ it runs pretty long.</p> \n     <p>From a personal perspective, I got to write\
  \ a lot of really fun material this year. Although I really enjoyed my <a href=\"\
  /community/blog/v5748dyo6sgf0?Youd-Better-Believe-It\"><i>Faiths of Golarion</i></a>\
  \ contribution and will cover a favorite scenario in a blog later this month, I\
  \ want to highlight <i><a href=\"/products/btpya1b8?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Distant-Realms\"\
  >Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Distant Realms</a></i>, a book I pitched in early\
  \ 2017 to highlight extraplanar \"landing cities\" from which to launch adventures.\
  \ Although Thurston Hillman and I each wrote our own entries (Shadow Absalom and\
  \ Yulgamot respectively), it's the Maelstrom archipelago of Basrakal that really\
  \ highlights the fun we have when collaborating directly. And if you like what we\
  \ create together, get excited for 2019's <a href=\"/products/btq01vyi?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Druma-Profit-and-Prophecy\"\

  \   <h3>Joe Pasini (Developer)</h3> \n     <p>2018 has been a heck* of a year! (*That's\
  \ all I'm allowed to call it.)</p> \n     <p>First, it saw the release of the first\
  \ major projects I worked on as a Starfinder developer:</p> \n     <ul> \n     \
  \ <li>Starfinder <i><a href=\"/products/btpya1rr\">Armory</a></i>! I especially\
  \ enjoyed ordering art for the keytar (check out the band sticker).</li> \n    \
  \  <li><a href=\"/products/btpya20r\"><i>Alien Archive 2</i></a>: I got to write\
  \ a bunch of fun stuff for this (pahtra and vlaka and [uplifted bears], oh my!)\
  \ and develop even more.</li> \n     </ul> \n     <p>Second, the majority of my\
  \ attention and effort this year went into work that won't be out in the world until\
  \ next year.</p> \n     <ul> \n      <li>The <a href=\"/products/btq01wrs?Starfinder-Beginner-Box\"\
  ><i>Starfinder Beginner Box</i></a> was a massive effort that nearly consumed me\
  \ whole. The result is a box full of goodies that I hope will be a great way for\
  \ folks new to Starfinder—and those new to tabletop roleplaying games—to see what\
  \ all the fuss is about.</li> \n      <li>I had the privilege to work with a number\
  \ of talented people on [unannounced product], and even got to make my own contribution.\
  \ I'm excited for this to be known to the wider world—mostly so I can brag on the\
  \ aforementioned talented people.</li> \n      <li>I wrote my first character class,\
  \ the vanguard (available for <a href=\"/starfinderplaytest\">playtest</a> through\
  \ January 16th [my birthday week]!). Lucky for all of us, the inimitable Owen K.C.\
  \ Stephens developed it into something, you know, playable.</li> \n      <li>I wrote\
  \ my first Starfinder Adventure Path volume, <a href=\"/products/btpzgd82?Starfinder-Adventure-Path-15-Sun-Divers\"\
  ><i>Starfinder Adventure Path #15: Sun Divers</i></a>. I work with prolific, creative\
  \ people who seem to author several of these a year, but for an average Joe like\
  \ me, this was no mean feat! Eternal gratitude to Chris Sims for developing the\
  \ adventure, which must've been at least as harrowing as writing it.</li> \n   \
