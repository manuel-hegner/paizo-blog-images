  \ say only a single man survived the doom that befell Fog Peak Hold. The Pathfinder\
  \ sages will tell you that’s wrong: five made it out alive, though only three were\
  \ still sane. The little matter of the collapse of the eastern pass had made the\
  \ hold irrelevant by that point, and I guess the Taldans have been busy with other\
  \ matters for the last few hundred years, so the place was never reoccupied.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>That didn’t mean no one was interested in it, though, even knowing\
  \ the last master of the hold had taken up strange habits. Venture-captain Kerivik\
  \ Stormhand had been eager to get his hands–maybe I should say eyes–on a cache of\
  \ old maps housed in the hold’s library and a few others, like me, had grown curious\
  \ about the last master’s reputed interest in golden figurines. Ilvana, well, she\
  \ was Kerivik’s favorite blade woman. She pretty much went wherever he did, even\
  \ if that was halfway up a forbidding peak in the Taldan wilderness.</p> \n    \
  \  <p>A switchback staircase led part of the way, and then a rockslide had taken\
  \ out everything but the three stairs short of the old brass gate. Still, Kerivik\
  \ was an old hand with mountains and got the three of us up safely. That’s when\
  \ I took over. I won’t bore you with the harrowing details of disarming the trapped\
  \ entry–I’m certain you’re well aware of my splendid facility with locks. Pretty\
  \ soon the three of us were making our way down the main hall. </p> \n      <p>The\
  \ wind can get pretty wicked up there in the Fog Peaks, and it made free play through\
  \ the hold, owing to the way the old wooden shutters had rotted off the high windows.\
  \ I could hear it moaning a lot more clearly than I could hear Kerivik’s grumbling\
  \ to be careful. Every now and then it gusted so violently it rattled the suits\
  \ of armor standing along the hall. A couple of them had succumbed to gravity over\
  \ the years, but most stood as they’d been left long years before, ready for their\
  \ long-vanished owners to don and wade into battle.</p> \n      <p>Kerivik stopped\
  \ to inspect a sealed portal. Me, I headed on toward a distinctive warm gleam I\
  \ spotted shining on a pedestal just a few paces away. Gold, as sure as the scars\
  \ on my face. It was a kneeling figurine of a slim horned man with a snarl, draped\
  \ in spiderwebs. I’d heard the old master had an interest in demonic lore, and this\
  \ would likely be quite the boon for the Society’s Grand Archive—if not Eando Kline\
  \ and the Vigilant Seal.</p> \n      <p>As I reached for the thing the wind picked\
  \ up once more and I heard a heavy whoosh from our rear, a shout of surprise from\
  \ Ilvana, and a rattle of armor from the nearest suit.</p> \n      <p>Turning toward\
  \ the commotion while keeping an eye on the likely evil relic, my notoriously keen\
  \ senses and Cayden’s own luck alerted me that the armor had rattled a little too\
  \ loudly to be from the wind. Sure enough, the suit over my shoulder had lifted\
  \ a long sword over its helm in preparation to lop off my head. Kerivik shouted\
  \ something from behind as I leapt back, the blade missing me by a handspan.</p>\

  \ alt=\"At the end of a dark hallway lined with imposing statues of armored knights,\

  \ Tomasz Chistowski</p> \n      </div> \n      <p>Busy as I was dodging head blows,\
  \ caught my first glimpse of what my partners were up to. Blades had started swinging\
  \ down from either side of the hall, one of them so razor sharp it had sliced a\
  \ few feet of deep green fabric off her cloak. Seeing our means of escape quickly\
  \ cut off by the swinging scythes, Kerivik redoubled his efforts to pry the stone\
  \ doorway open. I didn’t have the time to really assess the situation, though, with\
  \ the idol’s defender still upon me.</p> \n      <p>The armor stepped forward, pivoted\
  \ with military precision, and swung for me again. I’ve been a Pathfinder long enough\
  \ to know that only magic or a spirit was likely to be making that thing move, and\
  \ the odds of me hurting either with my blade, fine as it was, were slim to none.\
  \ But there are other ways to stop a rampaging suit of plate mail, and I slid left\
  \ of its next strike then threw myself forward. It’s counterintuitive, I know, but\
  \ rather brave, as you probably noticed. </p> \n      <p>I caught the armor about\
  \ its waist, smashing my chin into its waist chain, and sent it off balance. It\
  \ reeled backward, slammed into the pedestal, and fell in pieces. I dropped with\
  \ it and rolled. The figurine fell too, of course, and plummeted right past my face.\
  \ I’d forgotten I was holding my sword and it rattled off along the ancient stones.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>It’s a good thing I was already low, because damned if the big scythes\
  \ didn’t choose that moment to start swinging down across my side of the hallway.\
  \ I heard Kelivik shout that the weapons were getting lower and snagged the haft\
  \ of my blade. That snarling figurine was just out of reach.</p> \n      <p>Not\
  \ so one of the steel gauntlets from that vanquished suit of armor. I swear the\
  \ fingers were pulling it back toward a steel arm right when a blade struck the\
  \ wrist and dragged it along the floor with a deafening screech of wounded metal.\
  \ If I’d been a moment later that would have been my own hand.</p> \n      <p>“\
  Stop staring at the gold, Nerian!” Kelivik shouted at me. “Get back!”</p> \n   \
  \   <p>Now I was perfectly capable of losing myself in contemplation of especially\
  \ fine gold, but I swear at that instant I was still stunned a little by how close\
  \ that blade had come, and I was watching in awe as sparks flew from the wriggling\
  \ armored fingers as the gleaming scythe pulled it across the rough stone floor.\
  \ Proving Kelivik’s assessment of my motivations wrong, I turned from the idol and\
  \ scrambled back through the stone portal just as he and Irvana disappeared into\
  \ the darkness beyond. </p> \n      <p>For once we lucked out. We stumbled right\
  \ into the master map room, where tube after tube of old parchment lay under a thick\
  \ layer of dust in their honeycomb shelves, including all sorts of old records Kelivik\
  \ didn’t even knew he needed until he started looking around. True, there was also\
  \ a golden statue identical to the one that had lured me nearly to my death guarding\
  \ the stacks. It was twice the height of a man, but the rumors about how deadly\
  \ it was are exaggerated–the thing was so slow Irvana and I managed to keep it distracted\
  \ while Kelivik grabbed up his goodies.</p> \n      <p>The darned thing was so large\
  \ it couldn’t even get through the portal, so we ended up with quite a head start\
  \ before it had bashed its way out. By the time it reached us we had already started\
  \ down the ropes. It surged out of the fortress doors, took three steps, and then\
  \ ran out of stair and abruptly plunged about six hundred feet down the mountainside.\
  \ We had ample time to observe that none of its component pieces were moving as\
  \ we climbed down to safety. It was too heavy to haul the whole thing with us, especially\
  \ with Kelivik’s trusty haversack full to overflowing, but we did manage to drag\
  \ one of its arms back to the lodge. And that was pretty nice. I might go back to\
  \ get more of it soon—as long as adventure doesn’t call me off in another direction,\
  \ of course.</p> \n      <p style=\"font-weight: bold; line-height: 14px\">About\
