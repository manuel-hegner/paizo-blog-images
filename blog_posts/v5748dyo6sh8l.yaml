  \     </div> \n     <br> \n     <h3>James Case (he/him), Organized Play Developer</h3>\
  \ \n     <p>I think I have a pretty typical background for many people from Hawaii.\
  \ One of my grandfathers was Native Hawaiian, one of my grandmothers is a Korean\
  \ immigrant, and my other two grandparents are white—one from the neighbor islands\
  \ of Hawaii, one from Missouri (definitely pronounced with a -ruh). Growing up in\
  \ an environment where (checks wiki) 25% of the people were hapa, or mixed race,\
  \ I never thought much of it, but after leaving the island, I realized how much\
  \ I took growing up in a multicultural environment for granted, with a diverse set\
  \ of influence both within my own family and in the ones around me to draw on. In\
  \ my work now, I’m happy to be able to help push towards a broader view of what\
  \ fantasy can be. It’s no secret that fantasy games especially have often skewed\
  \ to a predominantly European setting, and while I love my knights and dragons,\
  \ don’t get me wrong, I also know that that’s just one mythology among many that\
  \ each have their legendary heroes to embody and monsters to slay (or beseech, or\
  \ fight alongside!). I’m happy to see more and more stories coming out of games\
  \ lately, and to be in a place where I can contribute to them by pitching creatures\
  \ from stories that my grandfather first told me around a campfire on the beach.</p>\
  \ \n     <br> \n     <h3>Eleanor Ferron (she/her), Pathfinder Developer</h3> \n\
  \     <p>My grandfather was Nisei—a Japanese American son born to first generation\
  \ Japanese immigrants to America. He was one of the most interesting people I ever\
  \ knew, serving in American military intelligence even during a war when Japanese\
  \ American citizens, including his family, were unjustly forced into internment\
  \ camps with only the things they could carry. He inspired in me both a fascination\
  \ for East Asian culture, but also in the Asian immigrant communities that helped\
  \ build the American West Coast. My work at Paizo has allowed me to work with peoples\
  \ and myths inspired from East Asia, and in our own Golarion setting, with Avistani\
  \ immigrants who draw from those same people and myths, such as the Tian communities\
  \ in Varisia or the well-known tengu jinx-eaters who sail the Shackles.</p> \n \
  \    <br> \n     <h3>Joan Hong (she/her), Customer Service Representative</h3> \n\
  \     <p>I’m the daughter of two Korean immigrants who left everything behind to\
  \ chase their American Dream. I grew up learning Korean traditional instruments,\
  \ eating rice at every meal, and thinking that the dishwasher was just an oversized\
  \ drying rack. If I’m being honest, I spent a lot of my childhood resenting my Korean\
  \ heritage because I felt like an outsider. What I wish I knew back then is that\
  \ the culture and traditions my parents passed along to me don’t make me an outsider,\
  \ they provide me with a rich background and history that broaden my perspective.\
  \ Recently, seeing greater Asian representation in media has touched me in ways\
  \ that I can’t express well in words. It makes me realize how important representation\
  \ is, and how much I missed out on because I felt like I wouldn’t fit in with people\
  \ I couldn’t see myself reflected in. As an Asian staff member and freelance writer\
  \ for Paizo, I feel empowered to share my perspective thanks in part to the support\
  \ of wonderful colleagues. The TTRPG industry is changing for the better every day,\
  \ and look forward to more content from diverse writers and streamers.</p> \n  \
  \   <br> \n     <h3>Ianara Natividad (she/her), Editor</h3> \n     <p>I come from\
  \ a family of immigrants, myself included, who moved from the Philippines and settled\
  \ in the United States. I grew up surrounded by the most hardworking people I’d\
  \ ever known. There was always that sense I had to work just as hard. Sometimes,\
  \ I felt the pressure of what it means to have to succeed, knowing that many of\
  \ the people around me—my mom and dad especially—endured and sacrificed so much\
  \ to build my life in America. </p> \n     <p>For most of my schooling, I was set\
  \ for a STEM career. All of my extended family’s children, in my generation, were\
  \ pursuing similar opportunities: STEM, medicine, law, and business. My exposure\
  \ to gaming all came from external sources, such as school and friends, so it wasn’\
  t something I openly shared with my family. Eventually, I realized STEM careers\
  \ weren’t for me. My parents felt confused and disappointed at first, but they understood\
  \ that I wanted to do something that kept me happy. They supported me as I studied\
  \ history, worked at a nonprofit, and pursued my editing and writing work. It felt\
  \ like my family knew I would work hard regardless of what field I chose, an ethic\
  \ that I witnessed and learned from them. So I did. I went into my gaming interests\
  \ hard, and all that ultimately led me down the path that got me working at Paizo.\
  \ Just one of the many reasons I love and appreciate my family.</p> \n     <br>\
  \ \n     <h3>Lu Pellazar (he/they), Editor </h3> \n     <p>Ohai! I’m Lu, an editor\
  \ (and occasional contributor) at Paizo. Most of my experience with being API in\
  \ the gaming industry is not just about incorporating my roots in the products I\
  \ work on. For me personally, it’s a lot of learning from other API gamers, writers,\
  \ designers etc. As a mixed-race diaspora kid who was raised by my Black dad and\
  \ Filipino/German mom (who was herself raised by my 100% Bavarian oma), it’s hard\
  \ to feel like I fully “fit in” with ANY of my cultures, let alone my Filipino side.\
  \ I never really embraced my Filipino culture until my mid-20s, when I started looking\
  \ into it more myself. I’m in my 30s now, but I’m still learning new things about\
  \ my culture every day; yes, even “basic” things that “every” Filipino person knows.\
  \ AND THAT’S FINE!! For anyone reading who might relate (my friends have to remind\
  \ me of this): Just know that being a diaspora kid is a cultural experience in and\
  \ of itself, and none of us are any less valid for it. There are a ton of amazing\
  \ creators and gamers in our community that we can learn from if we want to.</p>\
