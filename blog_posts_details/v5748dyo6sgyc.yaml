  alt: "Halcyon Spells. Through hard study, Magaambyans can meld arcane and primal\
    \ spellcasting. Halcyon spells are spells from the arcane or primal spell list.\
    \ You don’t gain new halcyon spells via the normal means you typically use to\
    \ gain spells; instead, you gain new halcyon spells and new spell levels of halcyon\
    \ spells only through feats. Halcyon spells are prepared or cast just like other\
    \ spells granted by your class; for example, a wizard who gained halcyon spells\
    \ would add them to their spell list and their spellbook, while a sorcerer would\
    \ add them to their spell list and their spell repertoire. If you have more than\
    \ one arcane or primal spellcasting class, you add halcyon spells to all such\
    \ classes. Each time you cast a halcyon spell, decide whether it is an arcane\
    \ or primal spell. You can’t heighten a halcyon spell beyond your maximum spell\
    \ level of halcyon spell, even if you have higher-level spell slots, and you can’\
    t select a halcyon spell as a signature spell. Each time you gain a level and\
    \ learn new spells, and each time you gain a halcyon feat, you can swap out one\
    \ of your old halcyon spells for a different halcyon spell of the same level;\
    \ this is in addition to any swapping from your class, such as via a sorcerer’\
    s spell repertoire class feature. You can also swap out halcyon spells by retraining\
    \ during downtime. If you have a spellbook, when you swap out a halcyon spell,\
    \ you lose the spell from your spellbook entirely."
