  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">Another\
  \ Friday is upon us, and I’ve got five more sweet, sweet figures from January’s\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy91pu\">Wrath of the Righteous</a> set of <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids\"\
  >Pathfinder Battles</a> prepainted plastic figures to reveal!</span></p> \n    <p>This\
  \ week it’s a mix of heroes and villains—two iconic Pathfinder heroes and a trio\
  \ of sickening fiends soon to bring trouble and mayhem to your campaign. On with\
  \ the previews!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71408_Imrijka_500.jpeg\"\
  > <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71408_Imrijka_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Here we have our iconic inquisitor, the half-orc\
  \ Imrijka! She first appeared in the <a href=\"/products/btpy8fo1\">Pathfinder RPG\
  \ Advanced Player’s Guide</a> as the iconic for one of that book’s six new classes,\
  \ and since then she’s just become more and more popular. WizKids did a great job\
  \ on this sculpt, and the colors are nice and vibrant. I always throw them some\
  \ curveballs when it comes to Wayne Reynolds’s highly detailed iconic characters,\
  \ and true to form, our partners there have absolutely delivered an amazing figure.\
  \ This Medium figure is, incredibly, at the uncommon rarity.</p> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71408_AlainMount_500.jpeg\"\
  > <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71408_AlainMount_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Like I said, I like to throw them some curveballs.\
  \ The set already includes a standard Alain, Human Cavalier figure that <a href=\"\
  /paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lfgf\">we revealed in an earlier preview blog</a>. But cavaliers\
  \ really shine on mounts, so it seemed only natural that we also include a mounted\
  \ version of Alain in this set, so he can really take the battle to the Worldwound’\
  s demons at his most effective. Of course, having both a mounted and unmounted version\
  \ of the same character gives a lot of flexibility for player and GM proxies, as\
  \ well. I can’t say much about this figure that the photographs don’t already say.\
  \ This Large figure is slated at the uncommon rarity.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  > <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71408_TarryFiend_500.jpeg\"> <img\
  \ src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71408_TarryFiend_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>The loathsome Tarry Fiend is the grunt of fiendish\
  \ armies, savaging enemies with two weapons and adhesive skin. The figure has great\
  \ armor detail, and towers over heroes at about 7 feet tall. The Tarry Fiend is\
  \ a Medium, uncommon figure. It appears under a slightly different name on page\
  \ 71 of the <a href=\"/products/btpy8odu\">Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3</a>.</p> \n\
  \    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71408_SlimyFiend_500.jpeg\"\
  > <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71408_SlimyFiend_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>If you think tar is disgusting leaking out from a\
  \ fiend, how about acidic slime? Here we have the exceedingly gross Slimy Fiend.\
  \ Shock troops and slavers alike, Slimy Fiends scour the lower planes looking for\
  \ captives to bully, exploit, and work until death. The Slimy Fiend is a Medium\
  \ uncommon figure. The Slimy Fiend appears under a slightly different name on page\
  \ 70 of the <a href=\"/products/btpy8odu\">Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3</a>.</p> \n\
  \    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71408_ShaggyFiend_500.jpeg\"\
  > <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71408_ShaggyFiend_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Even leaky fiends need leadership. Here we have the\
  \ Shaggy Fiend, the obese outsiders that keep the other fiends in line. The Shaggy\
  \ Fiends serve their thantotic titan leaders as advisors, covert agents, or battlefield\
  \ generals. They look a bit smaller than their fiendish cousins, but don’t let it\
  \ fool you. These bastards are CR 18. The Shaggy Fiend is a Medium uncommon figure.\
  \ It appears under a slightly different name on page 69 of the <a href=\"/products/btpy8odu\"\
  >Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3</a>.</p> \n    <p>And that’s it for this week. Tune in\
  \ next week for an early look at more exciting upcoming <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids\"\
