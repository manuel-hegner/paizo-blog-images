  \ <span class=\"date\">Friday, June 29, 2007</span> \n   <p>While there was much\
  \ debate over which of the fun and historically significant books in our <a href=\"\
  /store/paizo/planetStories\">Planet Stories</a> line should take the crucial first\
  \ few slots, picking the lead-off hitter was easy. As the internationally recognized\
  \ father of fantasy gaming, Gary Gygax has done more to help advance and establish\
  \ the modern concept of \"fantasy\" than almost any other figure, placing him alongside\
  \ such notables as J. R. R. Tolkien in terms of historical impact. Yet for all that,\
  \ surprisingly few people have ever read Gygax's original fiction. When the chance\
  \ arose for us to republish several of his novels, we leapt at the chance.</p> \n\
  \   <p>In the first of these books, <i><a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7x8a\">The Anubis\
  \ Murders</a></i>, Gygax opens the doors on an eerily familiar medieval world, a\
  \ world of warring wizards and murderous intrigue that stretches from the pyramids\
  \ of ancient Ã†gypt to the mist-shrouded cities of Avillonia. Someone is murdering\
  \ and blackmailing the world's most powerful sorcerers, and the trail of blood leads\
  \ straight to Anubis, the solemn god known by most as the Master of Jackals. Enter\
  \ Magister Setne Inhetep, personal philosopher-wizard to the Pharaoh, and his beautiful\
  \ and deadly bodyguard Rachelle. Can Setne use his magic and supreme powers of deduction\
  \ to untangle the mystery before he himself becomes the next victim?</p> \n   <p><i><a\
  \ href=\"/store/v5748btpy7x8a\">The Anubis Murders</a></i> hits shelves everywhere\
  \ this August, beginning with a promotion at Paizo's GenCon booth which will feature\
  \ Gary Gygax himself, meeting and mingling with those who carry on his legacy. So\
  \ pick up a copy, sit back, and see the world of fantasy through the eyes of the\
  \ master.</p> \n   <p>James Sutter <br>Editor, Planet Stories</p> \n  </blockquote>\
