  description\">We always knew <a href=\"/products/btpy9egu\"><em>Pathfinder Roleplaying\
  \ Game Occult Adventures</em></a> would have a full 9-level caster who could cast\
  \ all the biggest and baddest psychic spells. This was our psychic, running fully\
  \ on the power of her intellect. The big challenge with 9-level casters is always\
  \ making them unique without making their non-spell class features too powerful.\
  \ Getting full spell access is a big deal, and doesn't leave a lot of room for other\
  \ bells and whistles. This is also the Pathfinder RPG's first Intelligence-based\
  \ fully spontaneous caster, drawing on the strange psychic structures of her mind\
  \ rather than her force of personality. And that unique mental structure leads to...</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Psychic disciplines! Because psychic magic is heady and full of occult\
  \ weirdness, one of my priorities was making sure there was something for the player\
  \ to wrap their head around a little bit more easilyâ€”a frame of reference for how\
  \ her psychic works. Psychic disciplines fill that space by describing what techniques\
  \ the psychic uses to access the spells from her mind. In many ways, it's akin to\
  \ praying to a deity for a cleric or studying a spellbook for a wizard, but far\
  \ more individualized to suit how psychic magic works. (This wasn't just useful\
  \ for the players. Even the design team had some trouble wrapping our brains around\
  \ the esoteric concepts this book talks about, so it was valuable for us too.) Much\
  \ like sorcerer bloodlines, disciplines give additional abilities and additions\
  \ to the psychic's spell list mirror bloodlines in many ways, and provide roleplaying\
  \ cues. The disciplines didn't change drastically after playtest, except for a few\
  \ balance and thematic issues, particularly in the pain discipline. The final version\
  \ of the class adds several new disciplines: dream, faith, psychedelia, rapport,\
  \ and self-perfection. Faith and self-perfection lend a bit of a divine feel and\
  \ a bit of a monk theme, respectively. Some of these, like dream, required some\
  \ of the new spells from the book to function properly, so we waited to add those\
  \ until the final version.</p> \n    <p>Though our version of mental magic differs\
  \ wildly from ye olde psionic rules, the psychic's phrenic amplifications were designed\
  \ to recapture some of the feeling of augmenting spells. The psychic can exert herself\
  \ to dig into the workings of her mind and mess with the very nature of her spells.\
  \ Some of the new phrenic amplifications let the psychic read the thoughts of creatures\
  \ affected by a spell, spend phrenic points to improve her undercast spells, or\
  \ replicate metamagic feats.</p> \n    <p>Now, the biggest change to the psychic\
  \ isn't really any of her special abilities. It's her spell list. From the playtest,\
  \ the psychic spell list has expanded dramatically, including the vast majority\
  \ of the new spells from <a href=\"/products/btpy9egu\"><em>Pathfinder Roleplaying\
  \ Game Occult Adventures</em></a>. The psychic is also the only class with access\
  \ to undercast spells. The spell list more than doubled in size from the playtest\
  \ version. At the low end, the book introduces a telekinetic 0-level spell that\
  \ hurls an object at an opponent. With high-level magic, the psychic can duplicate\
  \ herself to be in two places at once, make a special ship that can take her and\
  \ her companions on a voyage through dreams, or permanently switch minds with another\
  \ creature.</p> \n    <p>Archetypes for the psychic have an interesting range. The\
  \ psychic can get better at psychic duels (a new subsystem in the book) with the\
  \ psychic duelist archetype, adopt physical mutations with the mutation mind, or\
  \ shed her physical body with the formless adept. The craziest archetype we've included\
  \ is the amnesiac, who forgets her own spellcasting ability and can attempt to recall\
  \ spells to determine which ones she knows at a given time.</p> \n    <p>Logan Bonner<br>\
