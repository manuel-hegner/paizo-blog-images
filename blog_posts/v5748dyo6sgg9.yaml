  \ been thrilled to work with all of you to make the new version of Pathfinder the\
  \ best game it can be. It hasn't been easy. The Doomsday Dawn adventure turned out\
  \ to be an excellent way for us to gather data about the forward edge of the game,\
  \ testing and tuning the numbers that make the game tick, but it was also quite\
  \ a challenge for many (and I'm not just talking about the deadliness of Part 5).</p>\
  \ \n     <p>It was an adventure unlike any we've published before. It was a test,\
  \ and it’s tricky to make any test fun, but we’re excited to see that many of you\
  \ had a great time with it, in spite of its challenges. Whether or not your group\
  \ made it all the way to the end, we want to thank you for running through this\
  \ gauntlet. The information we gleaned from our forums and the surveys has proven\
  \ to be invaluable in helping us improve the game, and we have your hard work and\
  \ dedication to thank for that.</p> \n     <p>For the past few months, we've been\
  \ hard at work making refinements to the game, and that work is far from over here\
  \ in the new year. The rest of the design team and I are going to be a little quiet\
  \ over the next couple of months as we finalize parts of the game and get it ready\
  \ to go to the printer. Once that hard work is done, you can expect us to start\
  \ showing off the final version of the game. We can't wait to show you how it turned\
  \ out!</p> \n     <p>So, from all of us here on the design team, and indeed everyone\
  \ at Paizo, thank you!</p> \n     <p>Jason Bulmahn<br> <i>Director of Game Design</i></p>\
