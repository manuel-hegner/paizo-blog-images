  \   <p class=\"date\">by Chris A. Jackson</p> \n   <h2>Chapter Two: Stealing the\
  \ Stars</h2> \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p>\"Don't put us downwind\
  \ of the slave markets, Caliel.\" Torius scanned Katapesh's busy docks, looking\
  \ for ships that he might prefer to avoid. The list had become quite long. </p>\
  \ \n    <p>The mate sneered. \"Squeamish, Captain?\"</p> \n    <p>\"It's the smell,\
  \ that's all.\" Torius tended to steer clear of the slave markets for other reasons,\
  \ too, but his crew need not know all the details of their captain's past.</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"Smells like half-orc day at Trillia's Bathhouse!\" Snick chimed from beside\
  \ him, her sea-green hair fluttering in the breeze. The crew chuckled and Grogul\
  \ growled low in his throat.</p> \n    <p>\"All secure below, Snick?\"</p> \n  \
  \  <p>\"Well, of <i>course</i>, sir! All my babies're off to bed.\" Snick's ‘babies'\
  \ were the twelve ballistae that <i>Stargazer</i> bore. When in Katapesh, his home\
  \ port, he ordered the huge crossbows dismantled and hidden in the smuggling niches\
  \ crafted into the spaces between the ship's decks. The gnome looked indignant at\
  \ the suggestion that she might be slacking. \"We're nothin' but a merchant ship\
  \ now.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Except for that ruddy great reptile in his cabin,\" a crewman\
  \ muttered.</p> \n    <p>\"Good.\" Torius ignored the comment. Celeste's magical\
  \ talents and her value as a navigator and astrologer far outweighed the risks of\
  \ having her aboard, and every member of the crew knew it.</p> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"\
  description\">He scanned the crew and nodded his approval. Though they still bore\
  \ weapons, they looked little like pirates. Their dark leathers and bandanas had\
  \ been replaced by loose vests, colorful pantaloons, and varied desert headdresses.\
  \ As captain, Torius wore a dazzling white kaftan that was subtly enchanted to keep\
  \ him cool in the blistering heat. Only Grogul still looked menacing, stripped to\
  \ the waist and showing his impressive array of scars. He'd traded his axe for a\
  \ pair of long kukris tucked crosswise under his sash at the small of his back.\
  \ </span></p> \n    <p>\"Might need a trip to Jexler and Young's, though,\" the\
  \ gnome continued. \"Those swimmer bolts just don't seem to be quite—\"</p> \n \
  \   <p>\"First things first, Snick.\" Torius ruffled her hair, smiling when she\
  \ grimaced and slapped his hand away. \"And the first thing is to conclude our business.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>When the ship was docked and all secure, Torius turned to his first\
  \ mate. \"Caliel, deal with the fees and bribes to the dockmaster and see to provisions\
  \ and repairs. Grogul, you're with me.\"</p> \n    <p>The pirate captain crossed\
  \ the gangplank and headed uptown as if he hadn't a care, for all the world a merchant\
  \ and his bodyguard out for a stroll. The burlap sack over Grogul's shoulder was\
  \ nondescript enough to be holding laundry, but inside their prize lay nestled in\
  \ a padded leather pouch, a fortune for the selling. Torius had long ago learned\
  \ that the most effective means of stealth is often to appear as if you have nothing\
  \ to hide at all.</p> \n    <p align=\"center\">∗∗∗</p> \n    <p>\"May Abadar smile\
  \ on your every endeavor, Master Alchemist.\" Torius bowed low and backed out of\
  \ the shop's opulent back room, smiling through the bitter taste of both the dark\
  \ tea he'd been forced to drink as a matter of custom and the poor deal he'd just\
  \ struck.</p> \n    <p>\"That took too long,\" Grogul said with a scowl.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Torius handed over a small bag heavy with gems and nodded to the door, but\
  \ once outside he grumbled, \"And they call <i>me</i> a pirate!\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  What happened?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Oh, just haggling,\" he said, then lowered his voice.\
  \ \"We've been paid, Grogul, but not what we were promised. I should have expected\
  \ it, really, but there's nothing we can do.\"</p> \n    <p>\"You said we had a\
  \ contract.\"</p> \n    <p>\"We did, but that thief caught me broadside. If I threatened\
  \ to take our business elsewhere, we'd soon have Benrahi Ekhan himself on our tails.\"\
  \ He shook his head ruefully, then cocked a wry grin and clapped the burly half-orc\
  \ on the shoulder. \"Don't worry, Grogul. We still made out well, just not as well\
  \ as I'd wanted.\" He glanced at the angle of the shadows. \"Come on; we've got\
  \ to hurry to make it to the Immaculate Repository before dusk.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Bankers...\" Grogul muttered, matching his captain's long stride. \"Now there's\
  \ a band of pirates!\"</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Grogul.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Grogul_360.jpeg\" border=\"0\"\
  ></a>\n     <br>Grogul is a bosun who gets things done.\n    </div> \n    <p>They\
  \ were met with aplomb at the Repository, and the certificates of appraisal that\
  \ accompanied the gems were quickly verified, their value deposited in his account\
  \ with a scribbled number on a leger. Torius withdrew a sum in gold for the crew's\
  \ shares and all the expenses associated with maintaining <i>Stargazer</i>, and\
  \ they headed back to the ship. Dusk in Katapesh reminded him of twilight on a tropical\
  \ reef—the time of day when predators began to hunt—but two well-armed men cognizant\
  \ of their surroundings had little to fear from common thugs. They arrived at the\
  \ docks just as the sun's glow faded behind the city's gilded domes, but the welcome\
  \ they received was more chilling even than the coming desert night.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Captain!\" A crewman named Joss ran up as they crossed the gangplank. \"You're free!\
  \ Where's Mister Caliel?\"</p> \n    <p>\"What do you mean, ‘free'? Why wouldn't\
  \ I be?\" The chill slithered down Torius' spine.</p> \n    <p>\"But the slavers,\
  \ sir! We got word a gang of Duenas took you, the filthy hyenas, and Mister Caliel—\
  \"</p> \n    <p>\"<i>Where</i> is Caliel, Joss?\" He scanned the worried faces and\
  \ shivered.</p> \n    <p>\"Mister Caliel took half a dozen men and went to rescue\
  \ you. This feller said he knew where you was, but that it'd take some doin' to\
  \ get you back. He, uh...\" The man balked, biting his lower lip. \"They took yer\
  \ navigator with 'em.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Celeste?\" The chill clutched his heart like\
  \ the hand of a lich. Torius gripped Joss's vest, jerking him off his feet. \"Where?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"We don't know, sir! That feller, he just spoke to Mister Caliel.\
  \ The mate said they'd need yer navigator's help to get you back. She took that\
  \ potion that makes her human and left with 'em, all cloaked and secret-like. Then\
  \ Snick followed 'em. Told me somethin' weren't right and she'd find out.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Damn!\" Torius released the man and began to pace <i>Stargazer</i>'s\
  \ deck, his mind awhirl. \"And nobody recognized this man? Did Caliel call him by\
  \ name?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Oh, aye! Called him Vemmy. I heard him.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Vemmy...\" The name meant nothing to Torius. He glanced at Grogul, who knew every\
  \ sneak and informant on the docks, but the boatswain shook his head.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>\"Never heard of him, but I know someone who might.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Let's\
  \ go.\" Torius turned back to Joss. \"Keep the ship secure. Nobody, and I mean <i>nobody</i>,\
  \ comes aboard. If Caliel or Snick come back, they stay put. Understand?\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"Aye, sir!\"</p> \n    <p align=\"center\">∗∗∗</p> \n    <p>Nowhere in\
  \ Katapesh is the night darker than beneath the Night Ramp, with its seedy cluster\
  \ of tents where informants and black marketers ply their trade. Grogul led Torius\
  \ past clusters of men sitting around small charcoal fires cooking meat of dubious\
  \ origin on metal skewers to a canvas-shrouded stall near the Obsidian Wall. There,\
  \ an old woman sat smoking a pesh pipe, her knobby, misshapen feet propped up on\
  \ a stool.</p> \n    <p>Grogul didn't bother with formalities or introductions.\
  \ \"Need to find someone, Hound.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Nice to smell you, too, Grogul.\
  \ Who's your friend?\" She sniffed, then blinked, the lamplight glinting on the\
  \ haze of her unseeing eyes. \"Don't think I know his scent.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I'm\
  \ Captain Vin of the <i>Stargazer</i>.\" Torius stepped forward. \"We're looking\
  \ for a man named Vemmy.\"</p> \n    <p>\"And what are you willing to pay for this,\
  \ <i>Captain</i> Vin?\" The old woman puffed on her pipe, drawing the acrid smoke\
  \ deep into her lungs and holding it there before exhaling. She smiled, thin lips\
  \ pulling back over elongated canines. Her name, it seemed, was apropos.</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"Gold or steel,\" Torius said, a hand on his sword hilt. \"Gold if you\
  \ tell us the truth. Steel if you lie.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I never lie, Captain. There's\
  \ no profit in it.\" She took another puff from her pipe. \"Twenty scarabs.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Ten,\" he countered.</p> \n    <p>\"Seventeen.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Fifteen.\"\
  \ He was in no mood to haggle, but if he didn't, he risked being marked as moneyed\
  \ prey.</p> \n    <p>\"Sixteen, then, if you insist.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Done.\" He\
  \ counted out the coins, but kept them in his palm. \"Where do we find Vemmy?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Street of the Seven Suns, north of The Block. He works for whoever\
  \ pays him, and isn't particular.\"</p> \n    <p>He handed over the money. \"Thank\
  \ you.\"</p> \n    <p>\"You already have, Captain.\" She laughed and jingled the\
  \ money in her hand before slipping it into a pocket.</p> \n    <p>\"Come on.\"\
  \ Torius grabbed Grogul's arm and turned him north. </p> \n    <p>A quarter of an\
  \ hour and dozens of twisting streets later, they entered the Street of the Seven\
  \ Suns. Most of the stalls in the bazaar were closed, but the alehouses and pesh\
  \ pits were open for business. A few questions and some judiciously applied silver\
  \ pointed them toward a narrow alley and a dark second story flat.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Round the back,\" Torius instructed his boatswain in a whisper. \"If he bolts...\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Grogul nodded and vanished around the corner, stealthier than his\
  \ bulk would suggest possible. Torius gave him a moment to get situated, then climbed\
  \ the rickety stair, the boards creaking under his weight. There was a click as\
  \ the door opened, and the glint of starlight on metal. Torius dodged as the crossbow\
  \ fired, and felt the bolt tug at the sleeve of his robe. He drew his sword and\
  \ dashed up the stairs before the man could reload.</p> \n    <p>The door splintered\
  \ under his onslaught, but he only caught a glimpse of the man's boots vanishing\
  \ out of a small window. He heard a crash, then a grunt and a scream. He leaned\
  \ over the sill.</p> \n    <p>\"Grogul?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Got him, sir.\" The half-orc\
  \ was bent over a prone form.</p> \n    <p>\"Dead?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Not yet.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Torius ran back down the stairs and around the corner. Grogul bore a\
  \ cut along his cheekbone, and the tip of his pointed ear was missing, but that\
  \ was nothing compared with the man he was pulling to his feet. One of the bosun's\
  \ kukris transfixed the man's shoulder from back to front, six inches of bloody\
  \ steel sticking out of his filthy robes.</p> \n    <p>\"You okay, Grogul?\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Bah! Just a scratch.\"</p> \n    <p>\"You must be Vemmy.\" Torius peered\
  \ into the man's pockmarked face. \"Not a good night for you.\"</p> \n    <p>The\
  \ man spat an epithet, then screamed again as Grogul whacked the hilt of the kukri.\
  \ Torius winced.</p> \n    <p>\"Now Vemmy, let me be clear. You tell us where Caliel\
  \ took my navigator, or you're tomorrow's dinner special at Chargut.\"</p> \n  \
  \  <p>\"Don't know where,\" the man said through clenched teeth. \"He just paid\
  \ me to bring the message and watch his back. Then that blasted gnome came along.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Snick? Where is she?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Dead.\"</p> \n    <p>Torius\
  \ felt the blood drain from his face, and he whacked the kukri himself. Vemmy's\
  \ scream was gratifying.</p> \n    <p>\"Show us where. Now!\"</p> \n    <p>Grogul\
  \ arranged Vemmy's cloak to hide the knife and frogmarched the man through the dark\
  \ streets. In minutes they reached an alley and Vemmy pointed.</p> \n    <p>\"In\
  \ there. I stashed the corpse behind the bins.\"</p> \n    <p>Torius's gorge rose\
  \ in his throat. The building was an abattoir, and the rats had massed for their\
  \ nightly feast. He kicked the rats away, and found Snick's body reasonably unchewed;\
  \ apparently the butcher's offal ranked higher than gnome on the rat culinary scale.\
  \ He pulled her into the faint starlight, and saw the mark of a garrote around her\
  \ throat. She was dead, her limbs stiffened and her face fixed in a ghastly expression.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Grogul, pick her up. We need to—\"</p> \n    <p>Vemmy gasped in shock\
  \ as the half-orc retrieved his kukri. Grogul hadn't simply pulled the blade out,\
  \ but twisted it and slashed down through bone and sinew. Blood quickly darkened\
  \ the man's robes, and he crumpled to the refuse-strewn ground. Grogul wiped the\
  \ blade on Vemmy's cloak and sheathed it.</p> \n    <p>\"You were sayin', Captain?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"I was saying, we need to get her to Gozreh's temple.\"</p> \n  \
  \  <p>\"Why?\" He picked up the gnome's corpse and tucked it under his arm.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Because, Grogul,\" Torius said, leading the way into the night, \"\
