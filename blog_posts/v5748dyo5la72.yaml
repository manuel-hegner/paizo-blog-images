  \ Varisia-Style</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Wednesday, May 16, 2007</p> \n   <p>Hot\
  \ off the server come three of the latest <i>Pathfinder</i> sketches, this time\
  \ for the <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7xpx\"><i>Rise of the Runelords Player's Guide</i></a>.\
  \ See what Player's Guide author Wes Schneider has to say about each of them:</p>\
  \ \n   <p><b>Dog Slicer:</b> A savage weapon created from castoff bits of sharpened\
  \ waste metal, goblins named these small swords after the act for which they're\
  \ most commonly employed. Holes drilled in the blade make them easier to heft by\
  \ enthusiastic but weak-armed murderers. Most dog slicers are size Small. </p> \n\
  \   <p><b>Varisian Scarves: </b>Well known as entertainers with a flair for the\
  \ dramatic, Varisians often employ seductive garb and entrancing props in their\
  \ performances. Scarves of colorful cloth and transparent silk, or bearing elaborately\
  \ embroidered scenes, are thus favorite accessories of the wandering folk. Aside\
  \ from the mundane variety, though, clever Varisians have subtly repurposed these\
  \ iconic tools for a variety of covert uses. The <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7xpx\"\
  ><i>Rise of the Runelords Player's Guide</i></a> features three types of modified\
  \ scarves to aid Varisians in their adventures: bladed, pocketed, and reinforced.</p>\
  \ \n   <p><b>Star of Desna:</b> An ancient weapon favored by Varisian wanderers,\
  \ this weapon has been adopted by the church of Desna as a second holy weapon. From\
  \ a central metal ring, four tapering metal blades extend like points on a compass\
  \ rose. Wielders can slash with the star or throw it like a less-aerodynamic chakram.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Excited yet? The above are just three of the twelve new Varisian items\
  \ we'll be introducing in the <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7xpx\"><i>Rise of the Runelords\
  \ Player's Guide</i></a>, which will be available in printed form for just two dollars\
  \ and online for free at our website. For information on things like the earth breaker,\
  \ barbarian chew, or ogre hook, you'll just have to stay tuned...</p> \n   <p>James\
