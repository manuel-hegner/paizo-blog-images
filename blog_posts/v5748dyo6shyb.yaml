  \ community write up some magic items inspired by lunar new year to put into your\

  \ a safe and prosperous new year!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     \

  \ \n     <h3>James Case</h3> \n     <p>My howmi (I couldn’t properly pronounce halmeoni\
  \ when I was a toddler, abbreviations were made) is a great cook, but growing up,\
  \ she made Korean food very rarely (Too much chopping! Just chop chop chop! Howmi\
  \ don’t wanna chop so much!). New years was always the big exception, where she’\
  d make enough food to feed everyone for... honestly, several days. We always had\
  \ to have our tteokguk first to make sure we’d have good luck for the next year,\
  \ and it was always the right way to start things off. Happy new year!</p> \n  \
  \   <h4>Tteokguk of Time Advancement — Item 5</h4> \n     <p><b>Consumable, Magical,\
  \ Transmutation, Polymorph</b><br> <b>Usage</b> Held in 1 hand; <b>Bulk</b> L</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Dumplings and rice cakes float invitingly between seaweed and egg in\
  \ this comforting soup. While normal tteokguk helps you gain an extra year of age\
  \ when you eat it, the magic in tteokguk of time advancement takes this a step further.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>Activate</b> [one-action] Interact; <b>Effect</b> Upon eating the\
  \ tteokguk, you gain several years of age, morphing into an older version of yourself.\
  \ Your physical appearance and personality change to those you would have at any\
  \ age older than your current one. This grants you a +4 status bonus to Deception\
  \ checks to pass as the chosen age, and you can add your level as a proficiency\
  \ bonus to these checks even if you're untrained. Furthermore, unless a creature\
  \ specifically uses a Seek action or otherwise carefully examines you, it doesn't\
  \ get a chance to notice that you aren't at your true age. This lasts until morning\
  \ of the next day, at which point you are temporarily immune until the next lunar\
  \ new year.</p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Eleanor Ferron</h3> \n     <p>Every new year,\
  \ my dad's side of the family would gather at my grandma and grandpa's house for\
  \ a large family reunion. There weren't enough rooms or beds for all the cousins,\
  \ us kids would fight with one another, and of course after a few days we were all\
  \ sick of being there. But they're some of my fondest memories. On New Year's Day\
  \ we would make sushi and lotus root, serve kuromame and the horrible lucky fish\
  \ cake (which I would begrudgingly choke down a single slice of), but my favorite\
  \ was my grandpa's inarizushi—tangy sushi rice inside sweet fried tofu pockets.\
  \ I struggled for ages to be able to split open the delicate fried tofu without\
  \ ripping the pockets open, and was so proud of myself when I got good at it. In\
  \ Japan, they are said to be favored by the rice goddess Inari and her fox servants.\
  \ I didn't know anything about the myths associated with them until later; my brother\
  \ must have told me when he got interested in studying Japanese culture. Grandpa\
  \ probably would have gotten grumpy if we'd brought it up, but he might not have\
  \ minded giving one to a hungry fox. He loved nature and animals, and would go out\
  \ in the morning to garden and feed the flock of California quail who hid in the\
  \ tiny bamboo thicket on the edge of his yard. They came so often we used to call\
  \ them his little chickens.</p> \n     <p>You really shouldn't feed wild animals,\
  \ but in a fantasy game it's harmless fun.</p> \n     <h4>Shrine Inarizushi — Level\
  \ 1</h4> \n     <p><b>Divination, Consumable, Divine</b><br> <b>Usage</b> held in\
  \ 1 hand; <b>Bulk</b> L</p> \n     <p><b>Activate</b> one minute (Interact)<br>\
  \ A splash of sacred sake in the rice vinegar used to prepare this sushi makes it\
  \ a suitable offering to the goddess Daikitsu and her favored fox servants. You\
  \ place the sushi before a shrine of the goddess Daikitsu or in a wilderness area\
  \ that naturally harbors foxes. For the next hour, whenever you are in exploration\
  \ mode, roll a separate Search activity check with a +1 status bonus; this does\
  \ not affect your Speed. If the check succeeds, a fox appears to inform you of this\
  \ discovery as best as it can, although it cannot speak.</p> \n     <br> \n    \
  \ <h3>Sen.H.H.S.</h3> \n     <p>In the days leading up to Chinese New Year, my family\
  \ and I often visit Songshan Ciyou Temple for our annual prayers to the gods there.\
  \ Like many other temples here, Ciyou Temple hosts a multitude of Taoist-Buddhist\
  \ gods under one roof. Other than just for convenience, I think it is also a testimony\
  \ of variety and complexity within a culture, something I do my best to reflect\
  \ in my writing.</p> \n     <p>Last year has been a full-on bumpy ride, but it was\
  \ consequently highly rewarding. I learned a lot, tried a lot, and flailed a lot\
  \ in the process. I’m grateful to be a member of the greater Paizo creative community\
  \ as their support means the world to me. There is a lot to look forward to, and\
  \ since I can’t talk about many of them right now, follow me on Twitter (<a href=\"\
  https://twitter.com/SenHHS\">@SenHHS</a>) for when those announcements drop!</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Wishing everyone a happy Year of the Tiger! *Roar*</p> \n     <h4>Incense\
  \ Bundle of Annual Blessings — Item 8</h4> \n     <p><b>Consumable, Magical</b><br>\
  \ <b>Usage</b> held in 1 hand; <b>Bulk</b> L</p> \n     <p>The twelve incense sticks\
  \ wrapped in this bundle vary in shade and color, reflecting the deities the months\
  \ are named after. Offering all incense sticks to their respective deities within\
  \ a week is said to bring unparalleled luck, though gaining entry to all the necessary\
  \ shrines and temples can pose quite a challenge. Those that complete the challenge\
  \ gain can, when affected by a misfortune effect, automatically disrupt it as the\
  \ incense wards off the bad luck. This ability can be used once a month for the\
  \ next 12 months.</p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Jessie Lo</h3> \n     <p>Hi I’m Jessie,\
  \ you can find me on my Pathfinder 2e podcast <a rhef=\"https://twitter.com/GobletsandGays\"\
  >@GobletsandGays</a> and on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/akinomii_art\"\
  >@akinomii_art</a>. During Chinese New Year, it is very common to give out hongbao,\
  \ red packets/envelopes, to your loved ones. Usually, they contain money, which\
  \ is used to wish good luck, health, and wealth for the new year. It's also common\
  \ to give out red packets as gifts, which often means a red packet is reused by\
  \ several people until it wears out. It has also become common to get red packets\
  \ from malls, which usually have a piece of chocolate, candy or special coupons.</p>\
  \ \n     <h4>Hongbao of Many Things — Item 5</h4> \n     <p><b>Conjuration, Magical</b><br>\
  \ <b>Usage</b> held in 1 hand; <b>Bulk</b> L</p> \n     <p>This enchanted long,\
  \ red envelope is decorated with beautiful illustrations in gold ink. The hongbao\
  \ holds twelve slips safely within.</p> \n     <p><b>Activate</b> [one-action] Interact;\
  \ <b>Effect</b> You draw a randomly selected slip from the hongbao, which transforms\
  \ permanently into a useful item. Until you draw another item, the illustration\
  \ on the outside of the hongbao changes to one of twelve animals, matching the item\
  \ pulled. Each slip can be drawn only once; after the last slip is gone, the hongbao\
  \ becomes a non-magical red envelope that retains the illustration of the final\
  \ slip drawn. The effects of each slip are as follows:</p> \n     <ol> \n      <li>3d4\
  \ small firecracker pellets that let out a loud squeak when thrown against a hard\
  \ surface. </li>\n      <li>Embroidered leather armor made from oxhide.</li> \n\
  \      <li>A <em>lesser healing potion</em>, except it is applied as a balm instead\
  \ of drunk.</li> \n      <li>A stuffed bunny dressed in red robes.</li> \n     \
  \ <li>50 feet of coiled silk rope.</li> \n      <li>A bottle of snake wine.</li>\
  \ \n      <li>A wooden, horse-drawn wagon.</li> \n      <li>A musical instrument\
  \ made out of a ram’s horn.</li> \n      <li>A collapsible metal-banded bo staff.</li>\
  \ \n      <li>An ornate jeweled egg.</li> \n      <li>A small, jade, statuette of\
  \ a guardian lion dog.</li> \n      <li>6 delicious pork buns that function as emergency\
  \ rations.</li> \n     </ol> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Tan Shao Han</h3> \n     <p>Happy\
  \ Lunar New Year! May you all enjoy roaring good fortune in the year of the tiger!\
  \ Based in Singapore, Shao Han (<a href=\"https://www.curiouschimeras.com/\">https://www.curiouschimeras.com/</a>)\
  \ is a member of the #RPGSEA movement who has created content for various RPGs,\
  \ including Pathfinder 2, Blades in the Dark, and ARC. Fun fact: Due to Shao Han\
  \ being taller than most of his family, he enjoys a +1 to his Cooking Lore checks\
  \ when eating yusheng, and adds the reach trait and gains the critical specialization\
  \ effects on his chopsticks attacks.</p> \n     <h4>Seven-Color Raw Fish Salad —\
  \ Item 8</h4> \n     <p><b>Consumable, Divination, Fortune, Magical</b><br> <b>Price</b>\
  \ 88 gp<br> <b>Usage</b> Prepared with 2 hands; <b>Bulk</b> 1</p> \n     <p>An appetizer\
  \ popularized in Goka, seven-color raw fish salad (qicai yusheng) is both fun and\
  \ tasty to eat. This large platter of salad of raw fish, seafood, fruits, and vegetables\
  \ of various hues is dressed in generous drizzlings of crushed peanuts, plum sauce,\
  \ and sesame oil. During the Lunar New Year, consuming the seven-color raw fish\
  \ salad (as 'seven colors' sounds similar to 'seven riches') is a grand, often messy,\
  \ affair of spectacle and skill. Diners gather around the platter with long chopsticks\
  \ to toss the salad, lifting the assorted ingredients as high as possible without\
  \ dropping them off the table; erudite diners lead the table in uttering auspicious\
  \ sayings to wish good fortune for the new year.</p> \n     <p><b>Activate</b> 1\
  \ minute (command, Interact); <b>Effect</b> You toss the ingredients of the seven-color\
  \ raw fish salad into the air to prepare the dish. You must attempt a DC 20 Cooking\
  \ Lore check, with the following results.</p> \n     <p><b>Critical Success</b>\
  \ You manage to toss the ingredients deftly without wasting food, and your enthusiastic\
  \ recitation of auspicious sayings is well received—a sign of impending good fortune!\
  \ For the first month of the coming year, you enjoy a +2 bonus to skill checks to\
  \ Earn Income and Diplomacy checks made to Gather Information about job opportunities.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>Success</b> You toss the ingredients adroitly, wasting a minimum\
  \ of seafood, and your delivery of auspicious sayings is respectable. For the first\
  \ month of the coming year, you gain a +1 bonus to skill checks to Earn Income and\
  \ Diplomacy checks made to Gather Information about job opportunities.</p> \n  \
  \   <p><b>Failure</b> You fumble too many of the ingredients to have enough left\
  \ to eat.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n   </div> <!-- tags: Paizo, Community, Paizo\
