  \ Society</a> at Gen Con 50, the team now turns its eyes on releasing Starfinder\
  \ Society versions of the current Pathfinder Society programs. There is a lot of\
  \ text to read, so I'm keeping my introduction short. All of the following text\

  \ that don't qualify for Paizo convention support.</li> \n       <li><b>Qualifying\
  \ Location</b>: Any location with an associated venture-officer of any rank, from\
  \ agent to regional coordinator.</li> \n       <li><b>Qualifying Event</b>: Any\
  \ public event at a qualifying location.</li> \n       <li><b>Pathfinder Society\
  \ Program Dates</b>: Yearly, starting in February and ending January 31 of the following\
  \ year (effective 2017 dates are February 13 to January 31, 2018).</li> \n     \

  \ \n      <ol>\n       <li>Venture-officer (VO) plans an event, either one off or\
  \ reoccurring, for their location.</li> \n       <li>VO completes a <a href=\"/include/EventSupportRequestForm.zip\"\
  >Support Request Form</a>, noting which organized play programs running, and sends\
  \ to their Regional Venture-Coordinator (RVC) to indicate interest.</li> \n    \
  \   <li>RVC confirms VO status and confers with VO about implementing the program.</li>\
  \ \n       <li>RVC adds event to the regional support tracker.</li> \n       <li>RVC\
  \ sends a regional support package to VO. Package includes GM tracking cards, player\
  \ boons, and a tiered GM boon.</li> \n       <li>VO advertises event as Regional\

  spaced-header-small\">Rewards</h3> \n      <ul>\n       <li>Players have a 10% chance\
  \ per game played at an event to win a boon, which is the same rate as a player\
  \ at a convention. VOs will determine the method of boon distribution for their\
  \ venue, after consulting with their RVC. Some suggested methods include rolling\
  \ a 19-20 on a d20, earning a token each game played with each token increasing\
  \ the likelihood of receiving a boon, or entries into a raffle.</li> \n       <li>GMs\
  \ earn a race boon with different levels of reward. If a GM runs 6 games at qualifying\
  \ events, they earn Reward A. If they GM 12 games at qualifying locations during\
  \ the program period, they earn Reward B. If they GM 24 games at qualifying events\
  \ over the course of the program period, they earn Reward C.</li>\n      </ul> \n\

  \ Guild Retail Incentive Program</b>: \n     <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\"\
  \ onclick=\"toggleSpoiler(this)\"> \n     <div class=\"spoiler-text\"> \n      <p><i>This\
  \ program is designed to encourage players to reward retail locations that are providing\
  \ space for Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild players. Locations utilizing the\
  \ program should advertise its presence to their clientele. We realize that each\
  \ location is unique, and has an overriding right to determine what is best for\
  \ their business, so participation in this program is not mandatory. In cases where\
  \ the specifics of the program don't align well with the retail's procedures (for\
  \ example, if they don't provide receipts, or they run daily tabs), the event coordinator\
  \ should work with the retailer to best approximate the intent of the policy.</i></p>\
  \ \n      <blockquote> \n       <p>Game stores and other retail locations are an\
  \ important part of the Starfinder Society community, and it's important to support\
  \ them so that they continue to provide support for Starfinder Society play. Under\
  \ this program, players can redeem receipts in exchange for modest benefits for\
  \ the entire party.</p> \n       <p>Redeeming a receipt simply involves showing\
  \ it to the event coordinator, who marks the receipt to denote that it was used.\
  \ A player can only use a receipt in this way on the day of the purchase, and only\
  \ for an event at that venue. The receipt need not include Paizo products—any products\
  \ the venue sells count as qualifying purchases. Players cannot acquire or redeem\
  \ receipts during their own turn or during any player's encounter; otherwise, players\
  \ can acquire and redeem receipts during play only when doing so does not significantly\
  \ disrupt gameplay.</p> \n       <p>If the combined value of the receipts redeemed\
  \ by players at the table exceeds $10, all of the characters at the table receive\
  \ the ongoing benefit described below, and each character chooses one of the single-use\
  \ benefits described below. If the combined value exceeds $50, you may use the enhanced\
  \ version of the applicable benefits instead. (In countries that use currencies\
  \ other than US Dollars, use approximate equivalents of $10 and $50; don't worry\
  \ too much about figuring out the exact exchange rate.) The ongoing benefit lasts\
  \ for up to 5 hours, and each character may use their chosen one-time benefit once\
  \ in each scenario played during those 5 hours. Characters can only receive the\
  \ benefits once during any 5-hour block. No matter how many receipts the players\
  \ have, the table can never use the same benefit more than once during a game session;\
  \ they can, however, gain both benefits during a session.</p> \n       <blockquote>\
  \ \n        <h3>Ongoing Benefit (for all characters)</h3> \n        <p><b>Harder\
  \ to Kill</b>: Reduce the number of Resolve Points required to stabilize by 1.<br>\
  \ <i>Enhanced Version</i>: Reduce the number of Resolve Points required to stabilize\
  \ by 2.</p> \n        <h3>Single-Use Benefits (each character chooses one)</h3>\
  \ \n        <p><b>Cheaper Healing</b>: Before the end of the session, you can use\
  \ the benefit to reduce the Fame cost of purchases listed on the Basic Purchasing\
  \ Plan boon* by 1 (minimum 0). Qualifying purchases include dispel magic, lesser\
  \ restoration, make whole, remove affliction, break enchantment, greater dispel\
  \ magic, restoration, regenerate, or raise dead.<br> <i>Enhanced Version</i>: Reduce\
  \ the cost above the cost by 2.<br> <span class=\"tiny\"><i>*Starfinder Society\
  \ Roleplaying Guild Guide page 27</i></span></p> \n        <p><b>Recover from Wounds</b>:\
  \ Anytime you spend a Resolve Point to regain Stamina Points through resting, you\
  \ can recover 2 points of ability damage.<br> <i>Enhanced Version</i>: Increase\
  \ the amount of ability damage recovered to 4.</p> \n        <p><b>Bonus Wealth</b>:\
  \ If you do not use the subsidized healing benefits above, you can instead choose\
  \ to roll twice and take the higher result when rolling a Day Job check.<br> <i>Enhanced\
  \ Version</i>: You also increase the credits you earn from the Day Job result by\
  \ 50%. This does not stack with other boons that apply to Day Job checks.</p> \n\

  spaced-header-small\">Promotional Bonus</h3> \n      <p>You have brought an accessory\

  \ you a skill bonus based on the faction your accessory promotes.</p> \n      <p><b>Prerequisites</b>:\
  \ Bring and display a qualifying faction pin to the game.</p> \n      <p><b>Benefit</b>:\
  \ Once per session, while wearing a Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild Faction\
  \ Pin matching the faction your character currently champions, you may add 2 to\
  \ any skill check. If you apply this benefit to one of your faction's favored skills,\
  \ listed below, you instead roll 2d4 and add the result. For this roll you also\

  \ \n       <li>Dataphiles: Computers and Engineering</li> \n       <li>Exo-Guardians:\

  \      </ul> \n      <p>Alternatively, once per scenario, while wearing a Pathfinder\
  \ Society Roleplaying Guild Faction Pin, you may add 2d4 to a Culture skill check.\
  \ For this roll you also treat Culture as if you were trained, even if you don't\
  \ have a rank in it.</p> \n      <h3>Promotional Convention Support</h3> \n    \
  \  <p>You have brought an accessory that displays your visible support to Paizo's\
  \ organized play program. This grants you a onetime boost of Hit Points during a\
  \ scenario.</p> \n      <p><b>Prerequisites</b>: Bring and display an authorized\
  \ convention support item to the game.</p> \n      <p><b>Benefit</b>: Once per session,\
  \ as a standard action, you can heal a number of Hit Points depending on your Reputation\
  \ Tier with All Factions. If your Reputation Tier is 0 or 1, you regain 1d8 Hit\
  \ Points. If your Reputation Tier is 2 or 3, you instead regain 3d8 Hit Points.\
  \ If your Reputation Tier is 4, you instead regain 6d8 Hit Points.</p> \n      <p><b>Special</b>:\
  \ You can only slot this boon if the scenario is being run at the convention associated\
  \ with the authorized convention support item. For an item to be considered an authorized\
  \ convention support item, it must have prior approval from the Organized Play team.\
  \ Event organizers are encouraged to email <a href=\"mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com\"\
  >organizedplay@paizo.com</a> to verify the validity of convention items for this\
  \ purpose.</p> \n      <h3>Promotional Record Keeper</h3> \n      <p>You have brought\
  \ an accessory that displays your visible support to Paizo's organized play program.\
  \ This grants you the ability to reduce the Resolve Point cost for a Stamina rest\
  \ or to improve a starship-related skill check.</p> \n      <p><b>Prerequisites</b>:\
  \ Bring and display a <a href=\"/products/btpy9tmp?Starfinder-Player-Character-Folio\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Player Character Folio</em></a> to the game.</p> \n      <p><b>Benefit</b>:\
  \ You can use this boon, once per session, in one of two ways. The first option\
  \ is to reduce the Resolve Point cost of resting to regain Stamina by 1 (down to\
  \ 0 RP). The second option is to reduce the DC of any single starship combat check\
  \ (including a gunnery check) by 4; this decision must be made before making the\
  \ check.</p> \n      <h3>Promotional Reroll</h3> \n      <p>You have brought an\
  \ accessory that displays your visible support to Paizo's organized play program.\
  \ This grants you a onetime reroll during the session.</p> \n      <p><b>Prerequisites</b>:\
  \ Bring and display a qualifying t-shirt or messenger bag to the game.</p> \n  \
  \    <p><b>Benefit</b>: You can reroll a single d20 roll you make during the course\
  \ of the scenario. You must follow all the reroll rules as listed on page 243 of\
  \ the <a href=\"/products/btpy9ssr?Starfinder-Core-Rulebook\"><em>Starfinder Core\
  \ Rulebook</em></a> when using this reroll.</p> \n      <p><b>Special</b>: When\
  \ a player uses a free reroll, she may present her Organized Play membership card\
  \ (available on their <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/myAccount/\">My Organized Play\
  \ page</a>) and receive an additional +1 for every GM nova she has earned, for a\
  \ maximum of a +5. Note, this bonus applies to the higher result of the reroll,\
  \ not just the second roll.</p> \n      <h3>Promotional Service Award</h3> \n  \
  \    <p>You have proven your dedication to Paizo's organized play program. This\
  \ grants you the ability to swap out a boon during a scenario.</p> \n      <p><b>Prerequisites</b>:\
  \ Bring and display a qualifying campaign service award (i.e. campaign service coin\
  \ or Wayfinder).</p> \n      <p><b>Benefit</b>: You can reroll a single d20 roll\
  \ you make during the course of the scenario. You must follow all the reroll rules\
  \ as listed on page 243 of the Starfinder Core Rulebook when using this reroll.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Alternatively, once per session, by spending ten minutes (including\
  \ as part of spending a Resolve Point to regain lost Stamina), you can swap out\
  \ any one boon for another boon that occupies the same boon slot. The boon you replace\
  \ cannot be one with limited uses that you have already activated this adventure,\
  \ though you can swap out a boon that you had to cross off your Chronicle sheet\
  \ during play. You cannot use this ability to replace a slotted boon with a boon\
  \ that uses up or take place during Downtime. You cannot use this ability if you've\
  \ already used the reroll option provided by this boon.</p> \n      <p><b>Special</b>:\
  \ When a player uses a free reroll, she may present her Paizo Organized Play membership\
  \ card (available on their <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/myAccount/\">My Organized\
  \ Play page</a>) and receive an additional +1 for every GM nova she has earned,\
  \ for a maximum of a +5. Note, this bonus applies to the higher result of the reroll,\
  \ not just the second roll.</p> \n      <p>This boon's second ability overrides\
  \ the standard rule that once a boon is slotted it cannot be changed.</p> \n   \
