  \ a new Pathfinder Second Edition actual play podcast! On January 6th, 2021, we\
  \ will be launching a brand new actual play podcast of a conversion of Paizo’s <a\
  \ href=\"https://paizo.com/hellsRebels\">Hell’s Rebels Adventure Path</a>. This\
  \ actual play will be available wherever you get your podcasts, and will release\

  ></p>\n     </div> \n     <h3>What is Hell’s Rebels?</h3> \n     <p>Hell’s Rebels\
  \ is a six part adventure path that takes players into the tumultuous city of Kintargo,\
  \ where someone needs to take a stand against an unjust government. Given the current\
  \ state of affairs, we thought that everyone could use a little escapism into a\
  \ world where a few courageous heroes change the fate of the world for the better.\
  \ The tone of this story is triumphant and cheerful, in stark contrast to our Patreon-exclusive\
  \ Tyrant’s Grasp podcast which serves up bi-weekly survival horror.</p> \n     <p>To\
  \ quote from the back of the adventure: </p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p>The\
  \ city of Kintargo has a new lord-mayor, but he's not someone interested in maintaining\
  \ that city's free spirit. Paracount Barzillai Thrune has placed the city under\
  \ martial law, and his cruel proclamations and sinister plans for the city bode\
  \ ill. Can a small group of heroes and would-be rebels stand against the might of\
  \ the Thrice-Damned House of Thrune and the Church of Asmodeus and save their home\
  \ town from being crushed under the boot of an infernal tyrant? Will one of Cheliax's\
  \ most powerful inquisitors make the city his playground, or can the rebels known\
  \ as the Silver Ravens rise up to bring a new era of freedom to the so-called Silver\
  \ City of Kintargo? Join the rebellion! Save Kintargo! DOWN WITH THRUNE!</p>\n \
  \    </blockquote> \n     <p>Rick Sandidge has converted <em>Hell’s Rebels</em>\
  \ from Pathfinder First Edition to Second Edition, and will be gamemastering this\
  \ audio adventure. He even converted the original campaign traits to Second Edition\
  \ backgrounds for the players to use. Rick has many years of experience GMing, and\
  \ will continue the tradition of masterful storytelling on the Find the Path. While\
  \ the podcast will be free for everyone to listen to, Rick’s conversion notes and\
  \ other goodies will be available to Patreon supporters. More details to come!</p>\
  \ \n     <h3>Who is playing in <em>Hell’s Rebels?</em></h3> \n     <p>We will have\
  \ five players on the show: Heather Allen, Jessica Peters, Jordan Jenkins, Rachel\
  \ Sandidge, and Ross Scoggin. No surprises here. We’ve kept the same personalities\
  \ and chemistry that we’re known for and haven’t added any new cast members.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Heather is playing Cesare Nightbloom, an ex-Asmodean elven wizard with\
  \ an adorable black cat familiar and a real arcane bent. </p> \n     <p>Jessica\
  \ is playing Adria Sylla, a half-elven artisan Storm Order druid with a sordid past\
  \ and an empty nest.</p> \n     <p>Jordan is playing Lucia Sarini, a human child\
  \ of Kintargo swashbuckler with a flair for the theatrical!</p> \n     <p>Rachel\
  \ is playing Vittoria Scordado, a half-elven urban sleuth investigator with an eye\
  \ for details and a drive to do good. </p> \n     <p>Ross is playing Niccolo Aita,\
  \ a tiefling (human) natural born leader rogue with a penchant for union organization.</p>\
  \ \n     <h3>Who is Find the Path Ventures?</h3> \n     <p>Comprised of a group\
  \ of longtime friends, Find the Path produces content that invites gamers and non-gamers\
  \ alike into the world of the Pathfinder RPG system. Known for their strong grasp\
  \ of the Pathfinder rules system and genuine, cooperative table dynamics, Find the\

  \ the system. Along with high quality audio and a respectful attitude toward each\
  \ other and listeners, Find the Path is building a vibrant, positive community.</p>\
  \ \n     <h3>TL;DR</h3> \n     <p>The first three episodes of Hell’s Rebels will\
  \ release January 6th, 2021 at 12:00am CST on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify,\
  \ and many other podcatchers. Listeners can then expect a new episode every other\
  \ Wednesday. Supporters on Patreon (<a href=\"https://patreon.com/findthepath\"\
