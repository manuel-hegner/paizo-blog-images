  \ Card Game Power Curves</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, June 9, 2015</p>\
  \ \n    <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Now that\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/wrathOfTheRighteous\"><em>Wrath of the\
  \ Righteous</em></a> is finally in players' hands, I'd like to talk with you all\
  \ about the thematic and mechanical motivations behind the different difficulty\
  \ of each Adventure Path. In order to do this, I'm going to talk about each set\
  \ while trying not to spoil anything, just in case some of you haven't started one\
  \ of the sets.</p> \n     <p>Let's talk about what it's like to work on a game that's\
  \ always changing and yet always <i>somewhat</i> the same. We explicitly design\
  \ each PACG Adventure Path to be compatible with all of the others. This means that\
  \ once you know how to play the game, you can easily jump into any set... and if\
  \ you really like a particular character from a particular set, you can bring it\
  \ into a different AP. Our default example of this is Lirianne, the iconic Gunslinger\
  \ character in <em>Skull &amp; Shackles</em>. If you decide that you'd really like\
  \ to play Lirianne in <em>Rise of the Runelords</em>, <em>Wrath of the Righteous</em>,\
  \ or in our upcoming release, <em>Mummy's Mask</em>, you can do so, and she'll work\
  \ just fine. For Lirianne, we recommend that you also bring along some of the firearms\
  \ from <em>S&amp;S</em>, but that's up to you—she works either way.</p> \n     <p>At\
  \ the same time, we also spend a lot of time, effort, and brainpower to make each\
  \ Aventure Path a new and interesting experience. We use a wide variety of techniques\
  \ to do this, including new characters, new mechanics, and of course, a brand-new\
  \ story with each one. One important technique we use that might not be obvious\
  \ to everyone is the <b>power curve</b>. This is a technical term we use to roughly\
  \ mean, \"How hard is it to get through the adventure at different points along\
  \ the path?\" If you've ever studied writing and film—and especially if you've ever\
  \ GM'd a long campaign—you've gone through at least some of this process yourself.\
  \ How strong are the characters at the start? When things get tough (as they usually\
  \ do), when does it happen, and how often? Do the characters have the resources\
  \ they need to protect themselves? Do they use them wisely, or do they have to scramble\
  \ to get where they need to be? As the plot unfolds, are they ahead of the game,\
  \ behind the eight ball, or both... and do they know it?</p> \n     <p>In our first\
  \ AP, <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/riseOfTheRunelords\"><em>Rise of the\
  \ Runelords</em></a>, the adventurers start out in the small coastal city of Sandpoint.\
  \ As the adventure begins, the town is attacked! A few minutes later, the typical\
  \ adventuring party is moving from location to location, finding goblins with torches\
  \ and kicking them in their oh-so-many teeth.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ></a> \n     </div> \n     <p>Mechanically speaking, the characters start off in\
  \ a position of relative strength, but also ignorance. Unless they are risky or\
  \ get unlucky, the typical character can go toe-to-toe with the typical goblin and\
  \ expect to come out on top most of the time, especially if there's some help available.\
  \ In the story, though, it's unclear why these torch-toting goblins would trouble\
  \ the town. Figuring out that secret is the step that takes Rise of the Runelords\
  \ from a one-shot \"defend the town\" session to an epic campaign against an ancient\
  \ evil of the first order. As the story progresses, the characters grow in both\
  \ knowledge and power, facing and overcoming increasingly dangerous threats on their\
  \ way (both figuratively and literally) to the top.</p> \n     <p>In <em>Rise of\
  \ the Runelords</em>, the character power progression is more or less linear over\
  \ time, while the difficulty of challenges is a curve that dips and then rises.\
  \ Character power starts very slightly behind the power curve in Adventure B. Then\
  \ the difficulty curve dips beneath the power curve through the middle of the Adventure\
  \ Path, rising over time until, very near the end, the two lines approach.</p> \n\
  \     <p>In story terms, this represents the change in difficulty as...</p> \n \

  \ behind the ogres, the rune giants behind the stone giants, and eventually the\

  /pathfinder/adventureCardGame/skullAndShackles\"><em>Skull &amp; Shackles</em></a>,\
  \ the doughty adventurers are press-ganged into service on a vessel most piratical.\
  \ You start off by learning to handle life at sea, including learning to crew a\
  \ vessel (and learning to hate geese) and learning how to get along with the rest\
  \ of the crew, be they friendly or otherwise.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ></a> \n     </div> \n     <p>Here the characters start the campaign off-kilter—\
  they're quickly tossed into a situation that's unlike what they're used to facing.\
  \ Whether you played <em>Rise of the Runelords</em> or not, you probably recognized\
  \ at some gut level that Valeros could fight his way free of his captors, but he\
  \ would be alone on a boat in the middle of an unfamiliar sea. From both a narrative\
  \ and a mechanical perspective, <em>Skull &amp; Shackles</em> was a bit more difficult\
  \ than <em>Rise of the Runelords</em> because we forced you to learn to do new things.\
  \ You could still focus on being the strongest fighter, awesomest bard, or stabbiest\
  \ rogue, but unless you could <i>also</i> handle yourself underwater, navigate a\
  \ ship, and manage a crew, you were very likely to run into serious trouble. In\
  \ game terms, we forced you to spread out your resources. Most characters can't\
  \ afford to dedicate every card and feat to a single, focused goal.</p> \n     <p>In\
  \ <em>Skull &amp; Shackles</em>, the difficulty is much closer to linear—the difficulty\
  \ increases mostly steadily over time—but the character power progression follows\
  \ a parabolic curve. In the very beginning scenarios, character power is somewhat\
  \ above the difficulty line, but it dips down below the line quickly in AD1, and\
  \ then rises above the line for much of the AP. Near the end, the character power\
  \ curve levels out, and it comes very close to the difficulty line by the end.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>In story terms, this...</p> \n     <div style=\"margin: 10px;\"> <b><em>Skull\
  \ &amp; Shackles</em> spoilers</b> \n      <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\"\

  \ as \"fish out of water\" and then come to master their new environment, as they\
  \ escape from captivity, gain their own ship, then make their mark in the Shackles\
  \ as part of the Pirate Council. Eventually, they discover an invasion plot and\
  \ move from freebooting around the islands to confronting the Chelish fleet and\
  \ taking the fight directly to the Hurricane King. \n      </div> \n     </div>\
  \ \n     <p>In our current Adventure Path, <em>Wrath of the Righteous</em>, you're\
  \ in the city of Kenabres to celebrate a famous past battle against the demonic\
  \ invasion into the Worldwound. Just when the festivities are about to officially\
  \ start, something very bad happens. This time, though, it's not goblins with torches\
  \ or pirates with whips. It's demons... lots of demons. Again, I don't want to spoil\
  \ too much, but the title of the first scenario in Adventure 1 is \"The Fall of\
  \ Kenabres.\" (I can assure you that it's not the follow-up to \"The Summer of Kenabres.\"\
  )</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-Ulkreth.jpg\"\

  ></a> \n     </div> \n     <p>This is our third set, and we have once again changed\
  \ things while keeping the game the same. In this case, the characters start out\
  \ \"behind the curve,\" both in knowledge and in raw power level. The demons you\
  \ face right from the get-go are tougher, more numerous, and just meaner than you've\
  \ seen before. On the other hand, you have a bunch of new tools to even the score.\
  \ In particular, <em>Wrath of the Righteous</em> adds both cohorts and mythic power.\
  \ Cohorts are a new card type in this Adventure Path, representing important, named\
  \ characters that will help you in your struggles against the demonic hordes.</p>\
  \ \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-Cecilla.jpg\"\

  ></a> \n     </div> \n     <p>Cohorts are bonus cards given to the party at the\
  \ start of scenarios. They make you a little bit tougher, and in the right hands,\
  \ they have some potent powers. Additionally, we've brought you <b>mythic path</b>\
  \ cards, representing the unlocked potential for mythic power possessed by each\
  \ of the characters in this set. <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lhc3\">Paul talked\
  \ about these already</a>, but the way they're added to the AP is important here:\
  \ mythic paths are unlocked by a specific event that happens in the story. When\
  \ you're playing <em>Wrath of the Righteous</em>, you get a chance to play a number\
  \ of scenarios before you pick a mythic path card, which helps with your understanding\
  \ of the card and the narrative arc of the story. On the one hand, you now have\
  \ some experience with the character, and you can make a better choice of which\
  \ path will be the most fun. On the other hand, it lets us level up the characters\
  \ in a new way. This helps us create the feeling of being slightly overwhelmed and\
  \ in trouble at the start of the AP, but it then gives you a dramatic moment where\
  \ you start climbing out of the pit, bringing yourself up to the level of—and even\
  \ potentially ahead of—the mass of terrible, evil banes we've assembled for you.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>In <em>Wrath of the Righteous</em>, both the character power level and\
  \ the difficulties they face are curved. Difficulty starts high, but dips quickly\
  \ below the character power level before rising again. At the same time, character\
  \ power level starts off relatively linear, rising as the characters recover their\
  \ footing.</p> \n     <p>In story terms...</p> \n     <div style=\"margin: 10px;\"\

  >\n        ... the characters start off behind the curve as the initial troubles\
  \ with the Worldwound are overbearing. You don't start with the feeling that you\
  \ can solve the problems of the Worldwound so much as you hope that you can withstand\
  \ them. As those that survive the initial onslaught unlock their mythic potential,\
  \ the character power curve catches up and exceeds the difficulty curve. These things\
  \ are tricky, though, and only time (and more Adventure Deck releases!) will reveal\
  \ what the future holds for your valiant crusaders! \n      </div> \n     </div>\
  \ \n     <p>The use of the d20 in mythic paths is the final piece in the puzzle\
  \ here. While it increases the top end of your checks, it doesn't help with everything.\
  \ It also doesn't change the bottom end at all. As many discovered while demoing\
  \ and playing WotR at the recent Origins Game Fair, d20s roll 1s just like every\
  \ other die. In a set like Skull &amp; Shackles, the d20 would be \"too swingy\"\
  \ to use often, but in Wrath of the Righteous, it's a great fit. You each have within\
  \ you the potential to do truly amazing things, but so do your opponents. The results\
  \ are far from certain... which is kinda what we were going for.</p> \n     <p>Since\
  \ we released <em>Wrath of the Righteous</em>, we've heard from some people that\
  \ the start of the Adventure Path— especially the scenarios in Adventure B—are tougher\
  \ than they expected. Hopefully, you now have a better idea what we were trying\
  \ to accomplish with this set and how did it. On the other hand, if you are finding\
  \ that the start of WotR is so hard that you're not having enough fun, there are\
  \ a number of options available.</p> \n     <p>First and foremost, remember that\
  \ the B Adventure is optional for the Adventure Path. It's recommended, but it's\
  \ not required. If you would prefer to start with Adventure Deck 1: The Worldwound\
  \ Incursion, that's perfectly fine. Also, if you'd like to play a little bit of\
  \ AD1 and then go back and complete the B Adventure, you should feel free to do\
  \ so. In a more extreme variation, you might even choose to finish all of AD1 before\
  \ completing the B scenarios, but be aware that you will be significantly stronger\
  \ at that point. In the end, any way that you find to have fun is a great way to\
  \ play.</p> \n     <p>Chad Brown<br> <i>Adventure Card Game Lead Developer</i></p>\
