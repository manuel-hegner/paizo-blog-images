  >The <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame\">Pathfinder Adventure Card Game</a>\
  \ is a cooperative game for 1 to 4 players, with an expansion for 5 or 6 players.\
  \ When I tell people this at conventions, I usually end up repeating it, because\
  \ \"1 to 4 players\" rolls naturally off the tongue, and so many people miss the\
  \ \"1\" at the start. When we first launched PACG, true one-player games were relatively\
  \ rare, and my own experience suggested that most people were listening for that\
  \ high number, not the low one.</p> \n     <p>Solo play in the PACG is an interesting\
  \ thing all by itself, in that it was both intentional and accidental. By that,\
  \ I mean that we had always expected that the game engine would work with one person,\
  \ but we didn't always expect that it would be a lot of fun to play solo. In fact,\
  \ at one point in early development, Mike and I had a conversation that included\
  \ this question: \"Have we invented 'grinding'?\" If you don't know, \"grinding\"\
  \ is a common MMORPG term that describes game play experiences that are considered\
  \ helpful for advancement, but usually separate from the good, fun parts of the\
  \ game. It also has an important meaning in the world of poker, but I defer all\
  \ conversations about poker to the honorable Mr. Selinker.</p> \n     <p>I'm telling\
  \ you all this as a lead-in to an abstract discussion about how PACG responds to\
  \ a variable number of players and characters. After some testing, we determined\
  \ that one-player games were actually quite fun (probably not for everyone, but\
  \ few game experiences are really good for everyone). Seven-player and eight-player\
  \ games worked okay, but the extra downtime and overhead really did seem to make\
  \ things drag for almost everyone. Six-player games were still pretty good; probably\
  \ a bit long for some people, but if you're the sort of group that regularly has\
  \ six people at the table at once, you're probably already prepared for the ups\
  \ and downs that brings. It also helps that six is a traditional big table size\
  \ for an RPG campaign, because we thought that some of our players were likely to\
  \ be Pathfinder RPG groups that played PACG as an alternative.</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ fundamental way that the game scales for variable number of characters is through\
  \ the number of locations that are involved in each scenario. If you've played any\
  \ of the PACG Adventure Paths, you've probably figured out that the default arrangement\
  \ is \"two more locations than players.\" This gives everyone a chance to start\
  \ spread out, grouped up, or in a mixture of the two while still leaving a few places\
  \ open to the future. It means that you can't quite end the game right out of the\
  \ gate, even with outstanding luck. There are just too many places to cover. If\
  \ you're designing your own scenarios, keep in mind that you almost always want\
  \ there to be more \"places\" than \"people.\" This creates room for progress.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The other major concern for scaling based on the number of characters\
  \ in play is the game's timer: the blessings deck. This deck is nearly always 30\
  \ cards (and if it isn't 30, it's pretty darn close). This is somewhat counter-intuitive,\
  \ because it seems plausible to most people that increasing the number of people\
  \ should increase the number of turns to succeed. In truth, the math is trickier\
  \ than it seems. If you dig in and figure out the right value for the timer for\
  \ each of the cases from one to six players, it's always very close to 30.</p> \n\
  \     <p>I'm starting out talking about number of locations and number of cards\
  \ in the timer deck, both because they're two of the biggest scaling factors, but\
  \ also because they form the basis for discussing two different types of challenges\
  \ in PACG: difficulty versus time. The game is balanced around the idea that you\
  \ can usually succeed against any individual card, if you're willing and able to\
  \ take enough time. Conversely, you can usually get through enough of the cards\
  \ in a given scenario to see what you need to see in order to win the scenario,\
  \ but you might not have the resources to succeed at everything you want to do along\
  \ the way. Of course, in order to win the scenario, you need both: You need to see\
  \ certain important cards, and you need to succeed against them. (We could also\
  \ describe this as a tension between short-term and long-term success.) The tension\
  \ between the two factors is important, and maintaining it is a tricky balancing\
  \ act. This is also one reason why we have scenarios that change the parameters:\
  \ we're shifting the balance of success versus time. When we add another location,\
  \ we're pushing the \"time\" side; when we make all Goblins harder to defeat, we're\
  \ pushing the difficulty side.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a\
  \ href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-LocalHeroes.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-LocalHeroes_180.jpeg\"\

  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6003-HereComesTheFlood_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>This also impacts in the number of characters, because\
  \ while the number of important locations goes up, the number of cards in the timer\
  \ deck does not. Obviously, this means that more characters will each have less\
  \ time to accomplish roughly the same tasks than fewer characters. The game naturally\
  \ tilts towards increased encounter difficulty in a one-player game or increased\
  \ time pressure in a six-player game. In fact, many people, upon first seeing the\
  \ game, assume that the timer deck <i>size</i> must adjust based on the number of\
  \ players. This comes from a perfectly natural assessment. With more cards to get\
  \ through, we'll need more time to get through it all, won't we?</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ answer, it turns out, is \"somewhat, but not as much as you probably think\".\
  \ Clearly, one character can be fairly cautious when using 30 \"turns\" to get through\
  \ 30 (10 per location) cards, while six characters will each need to press through\
  \ quite a bit more cards in location decks to get through 80 cards in those same\
  \ 30 \"turns.\" For many people looking at PACG for the first time, those numbers\
  \ seem so far apart that it seems like something must be off. In practice, though,\
  \ most six-player groups get through those scenarios with about the same win rate—\
  that is, success <i>against the scenario</i>. In fact, we found that larger groups\
  \ tend to win scenarios a little more often than smaller groups. Usually, these\
  \ games take longer than one-player sessions of the same scenario, so that total\
  \ rate of progress is pretty close to the same. Those of you who wrangle six-person\
  \ tables (of any game!) know that there's often a certain overhead to it that makes\
  \ a slightly higher win rate (and thus, a lower repeat rate) a welcome turn of events.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>How does this work out? If two characters use twice as many cards from\
  \ the timer deck, how do they keep up with the increased number of cards in location\
  \ decks? There are many factors, but the biggest (I think) is the marvelous power\
  \ of synergy. In PACG, characters are wonderful, powerful things. Simply put, having\
  \ more characters gives the players more potential power. There are more cards in\
  \ players' hands, more character and role card powers, and more major and minor\
  \ areas of the game covered. This is potent by itself, but when you add in the ability\
  \ to combine those cards, powers, and areas of expertise, that's where large groups\
  \ catch up.</p> \n     <p>Let's look at either end of the scale. With one character,\
  \ a typical scenario will have 3 locations of 10 cards each, including a villain\
  \ and 2 henchmen. With a timer deck of 30 cards, the solo character can afford to\
  \ proceed with caution, at least much of the time. A solo character probably wants\
  \ a relatively narrow range of boons, but this opens up the use of random boons\
  \ as \"hit points,\" fuel for other powers, and one-shot effects. In a three-player\
  \ game, Amiri probably has to consider whether to give that Cure spell to Lini or\
  \ banish it for its sweet 1d4+1 cards right now; in a one-character game, there\
  \ are no such concerns. With 30 turns, Harsk can afford to wait and reset his hand\
  \ whenever things get a little tense. Kyra can afford to spend her first exploration\
  \ on a turn to heal herself, even if she does nothing else. Merisiel, in many ways\
  \ the iconic solo character, can just call \"whoops, evade!\" over and over in a\
  \ way that would cause some serious time pressure in a six-player game.</p> \n \
  \    <p>If we add a second character—something that we recommend, just because the\
  \ wide variety of challenges can make it <b>really</b> hard for a single character\
  \ to handle everything we might throw at you—the math mostly remains the same. There\
  \ are now 40 cards in 4 locations, and 30 \"turns\" in the timer deck. There's some\
  \ pressure to explore more than once a turn, but it's usually not overwhelming.\
  \ Slow and Steady, as they say, wins the scenario. (At least, I think that's how\
  \ the saying goes.)</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-Lem.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-Lem_180.jpeg\"\

  ></a>\n      <br><i>Two great tastes that might not taste great together in your\
  \ first two-character team.</i>\n     </div> \n     <p>On the other end, the six-player\
  \ group typically has to cover 8 locations of 10 cards each, including a villain\
  \ and a gaggle of henchmen, and they've got to do it with the same 30 cards in the\
  \ blessings deck. This means that the large group needs to build and maintain momentum.\
  \ If each character encounters only 1 card each time she discards the top of the\
  \ timer deck, the group really isn't going to see most of the cards in the scenario.\
  \ That said, things aren't exactly bleak for the large group; in fact, they generally\
  \ succeed slightly more often.</p> \n     <p>You might wonder why this happens,\
  \ and there are many reasons. As a group, they usually can cover all of the bases.\
  \ The group can include both characters that like to stay with others and characters\
  \ that like to be left alone. Valeros can afford to spend most of his blessings\
  \ to explore his location again and again, because there are 5 other hands that\
  \ can donate a blessing if he <i>really</i> needs it. In fact, there are just a\
  \ lot more cards in general, so there are usually resources available for helping—\
  adding to a check, healing damage, scouting locations, moving characters around,\
  \ and so on. When the group is looking at defending open locations, chances are\
  \ really good that <b>someone</b> is good at whatever needs to be done, whether\
  \ that's succeeding at a skill check, bashing monsters, or just having the right\
  \ kind of card to spend. The number of weak spots goes down and the ability to cover\
  \ weak spots goes up. Sure, there's a bit more competition for some resources, but\
  \ when encounters <b>count</b>, the large group can almost always find a way.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>There's another big factor, too: that gaggle of henchmen. While 80 cards\
  \ in 30 \"turns\" sounds like a lot, the math is actually much friendlier; the group\
  \ needs to get through 8 locations, rather than 80 cards. Breaking out some basic\
  \ statistics, the chances are good (very good) that several of those locations <i>can</i>\
  \ be closed after encountering roughly half of the location deck. In Statistically\
  \ Average World, the large group will get to close each location after the fifth\
  \ or sixth card. If they're successful each time they get this chance, they're now\
  \ seeing about 50 cards instead of 80. Remember that large groups have a much greater\
  \ ability to succeed at \"important\" checks. They have more collective resources\
  \ to bring to bear, so their chances here are good. They can also afford (some might\
  \ say \"need\") to be a bit more aggressive in exploring, because the group safety\
  \ net is stronger.</p> \n     <h2>Different Challenges for Different Groups</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>I've talked about the different types of challenge faced by small and\
  \ large groups, and hopefully that makes sense to you now. Next I want to talk about\
  \ how we design for these different types of challenge, including how we impact\
  \ each type of group, and how we break it.</p> \n     <p>If we make the cost of\
  \ failure against a particular card especially high, this tends to hit the small\
  \ group harder than the large group. The large group can usually rally for \"important\"\
  \ moments in a way that the smaller group can't. This is especially true for nasty\
  \ henchmen, villains, locations, and scenarios.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ></a>\n      <br> <i>Meet the original RotR Power Couple.</i>\n     </div> \n  \
  \   <p>This is something that we keep in mind when we design scenarios especially.\
  \ While we try to make sure that most groups see most of the cards in a given set,\
  \ we also try to arrange to keep the \"meaner\" locations towards the end of the\
  \ locations list, so that they show up more often for larger groups that are better\
  \ equipped the deal with them.</p> \n     <p>When small groups get into trouble,\
  \ it's often because they really need to do something that is hard for the group\
  \ (say, a Divine check for Merisiel and Ezren) and they're low on resources at that\
  \ time. Effects that take cards out of your hand before the encounter are rough\
  \ here, because they're more likely to \"hit where it hurts\" in a small group.</p>\
  \ \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-Enchanter.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-Enchanter_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>On the other hand, the \"horde\" barriers are a good\
  \ example of cards that are aimed at keeping the challenge high for large groups.\
  \ When we force an encounter for everyone, we expect that some of the characters\
  \ will be able to best the encounter with minimal resources (which is great, because\
  \ it lets a player feel mastery), but often there will also be a few characters\
  \ who need help. This provides an opportunity for the group to come together and\
  \ figure out how to handle the challenge as a group. Sometimes, this involves someone\
  \ sacrificing himself to the challenge, thus spending his resources on someone else.\
  \ In these situations, we almost always let the group decide the order for the encounters.\
  \ We do this not just because it feels right for a cooperative game, but also because\
  \ it enables these sorts of tactical and strategic decisions. When a \"horde\" bane\
  \ must be defeated by everyone in order to itself be defeated, this creates a different\
  \ strategic cascade than if the horde is defeated based solely on your check, so\
  \ you'll probably want to proceed in a different order and play different cards\
  \ for each.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-DemoicHorde.jpg\"\

  \ this in mind, if you look through the various APs, I'll bet you can see its influence\
  \ everywhere. You'll see it when a giant deals damage to everyone at its location;\
  \ when a scenario encourages (or forces) everyone to group up; when a villain makes\
  \ \"you\" or \"a character at your location\" summon and encounter another bane;\
  \ when you're looking to see whether an item helps characters \"at your location\"\
  \ or anywhere; or when a power counts the number of open locations, or characters,\
  \ or locations. You'll also see it when you put characters who like groups (like\
  \ <em>RotR</em> Lem or Valeros) alongside characters who want to be by themselves\
  \ (like <em>RotR</em> Merisiel)... or at least, characters who want to be somewhere\
  \ other than where the fight currently is (like <em>RotR</em> Harsk).</p> \n   \

  \     </div> \n     <h2>Adventure Paths: Different but Same</h2> \n     <p>Finally,\
  \ I'd like to talk a little bit about how we use this aspect of the game when we're\
  \ designing Adventure Paths. Anyone who read my previous blog about the <a href=\"\
  /paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lhm4\">Differences in Difficulty between the APs</a> should\
  \ know that we aim for different experiences in difficulty over time between the\
  \ Adventure Paths. We also use differences in scaling of groups to try to give each\
  \ AP its own feel, but we want to keep the underlying game the same. This flows\
  \ both from our attempts to make the game \"different but the same\", and it also\
  \ flows naturally from the story of the Adventure Paths themselves. There are two\
  \ specific examples that I think are worth talking about here: ships and armies.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>In <em>Skull &amp; Shackles</em>, we knew right away that we wanted\
  \ to have ships in the game. We played with several different systems for ships\
  \ and ship combat before settling on the system used in the AP, and several of the\
  \ changes came directly out of group size scaling. Comparing <em>Skull &amp; Shackles</em>\
  \ to <em>Rise of the Runelords</em>, it should be immediately obvious that there\
  \ are some specific skills that are very important to <em>S&amp;S</em>, including\
  \ the skills that represent sailing, navigating, commanding, and repairing a ship.\
  \ The characters in <em>S&amp;S</em> vary in their talent with these skills, but\
  \ we tried to make sure that every character that we felt should be naturally good\
  \ at dealing with a ship <i>alone</i> should have some way to be good at these skills,\
  \ because we wanted to make sure that small groups could play the AP. Rather than\
  \ having a specific location separate from the characters, the ship is (when not\
  \ docked) assumed to be at the location of the active player. It comes and goes,\
  \ and when it's your turn, the ship is with you. We also changed the way structural\
  \ damage worked so that anyone could deal with it rather than only the characters\
  \ at the relevant location. This change made the ship and its upkeep feel like it\
  \ was a group responsibility, rather than an individual character's. These two factors\
  \ balanced each other. Some characters are naturally better with ships than others,\
  \ including dealing with trouble, should it occur. At the same time, everyone can\
  \ use the ship, and a large group has a greater ability to deal with ship troubles\
  \ when they happen.</p> \n     <p>In <em>Wrath of the Righteous</em>, we were looking\
  \ instead to create a \"crowded\" feel. You start off overwhelmed. Once you regain\
  \ your bearings, you get to reassert your (protagonist-level) control of the situation,\
  \ but the enemy still has you outnumbered. To this end, we created armies, both\
  \ yours and theirs. As nascent Big Damn Heroes, your army is more of a tool for\
  \ you to personally wield than it is a method to get someone else to deal with the\
  \ problem, but that shouldn't be a surprise. On the other side, army barriers require\
  \ an increasingly difficult coordination and mastery challenge, represented by the\
  \ set of six checks, each of which must be made without repeating. In practice,\
  \ this means that small groups can usually find something that they're good at with\
  \ a small expenditure of resources. With a larger group, chances increase that someone\
  \ is forced to try something hard for them, but conversely, other characters should\
  \ be able to find something relatively easy. The group <i>as a whole</i> must come\
  \ together in order to have any hope of defeating enemy armies.</p> \n     <p>This\
  \ is a big subject, and while I've written quite a lot about it, I'm sure I've missed\
  \ some parts of it. Please, throw me your questions below, and I'll either answer\
  \ them here or pull them together for a follow-up blog post, or maybe both.</p>\
