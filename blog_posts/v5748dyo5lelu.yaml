  \   <p class=\"date\">Friday, March 28, 2013</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"\
  > \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">With its piratical theme, the <a href=\"\
  /pathfinder/adventurePath/skullAndShackles\">Skull &amp; Shackles Adventure Path</a>\
  \ is a perfect campaign for gamers looking to add a little gunplay to their fantasy.\
  \ This summer's <a href=\"/products/btpy8xg6\">Skull &amp; Shackles</a> Pathfinder\
  \ Battles miniatures set therefore includes a few pistol-packing figures that will\
  \ help you bring your black powder fantasies to life on the tabletop.</span></p>\
  \ \n    <p>Guns are controversial in fantasy gaming, so you won't see a TON of them\
  \ in this set (or in the campaign itself, if you don't want â€˜em), but they are a\
  \ great thematic match for pirates on the high seas, so we couldn't resist including\
  \ at least a few of them here.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130328-Lirianne.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130328-Lirianne_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Up first is our very favorite gun-wielder,\
  \ Lirianne, the iconic gunslinger we first introduced back in <a href=\"/products/btpy8mcz\"\
  >Ultimate Combat</a>. Lirianne has an incredible amount of detail sculpted into\
  \ her outfit, and her costume motifs bring a hint of the Old West to the High Seas.\
  \ This Medium figure is slated at the rare rarity.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  /image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130328-Tsadok_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>Here we have Tsadok Goldtooth, the first mate of Kerdak Bonefist,\
  \ Hurricane King of the Shackles Isles and probably the toughest pirate lord of\
  \ the southern seas. Old Tsadok here is a half-orc in a fine coat with a cool pistol\
  \ and a nasty snarl. Our photo accentuates the colors on this figure and makes them\
  \ look a little more primary than they look with the figure in hand. The green of\
  \ Tsadok's flesh, for example, matches that of other orcs and half-orcs already\
  \ produced in the Pathfinder Battles line. Tsadok is an uncommon, Medium figure.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130328-Kerdak.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130328-Kerdak_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>And last up this week is the Hurricane King himself,\
  \ Kerdak Bonefist! Take a close look at that pistol hand, folks. Let's just say\
  \ Mr. Bonefist earned his last name the hard way. This Medium, rare figure is absolutely\
  \ phenomenal in hand, easily one of the best in the set and one of the most finely\
  \ detailed and well painted Pathfinder Battles miniatures to date.</p> \n    <p>Our\
  \ partners at WizKids continue to outdo themselves with every aspect of these miniatures,\
  \ from sculpt to paint application. I'm amazed every time they bring new figures\
  \ to the office, which has been happening at an almost weekly pace lately. (For\
  \ example, we're half-way through approving sculpts for the NEXT set, and have seen\
  \ all but about three figures in this one).</p> \n    <p>What I'm trying to say\
  \ is that it's a great time to be a prepainted figure collector, and it's a great\
  \ time to be collecting Pathfinder Battles! Now I'm off to go shoot a gun into the\
  \ air in wild celebration of awesome miniatures.</p> \n    <p>See you next week!</p>\
