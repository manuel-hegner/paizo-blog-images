  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Those of you who have been\
  \ following the Oblivion Oath campaign on Paizo’s Twitch channel are likely already\
  \ familiar with Zel, the lizardfolk adventurer who has been caught up in strange\
  \ and frankly creepy events beyond his control. Jason Bulmahn stressed that lizardfolk—\
  or iruxi, as they call themselves—would not be a player ancestry in the <i>Pathfinder\
  \ 2E Core Rulebook</i>, but us developers have known for a while that they’d be\
  \ quickly following along on the Core Rulebook’s coattails. In fact, Zel has been\
  \ using the final lizardfolk ancestry rules for a while, and with the upcoming release\
  \ of the <i>Lost Omens Character Guide</i>, you’ll soon be able to do the same!</p>\
  \ \n     <p>In the case of the Pathfinder developers and designers, this also gives\
  \ us an opportunity to expand upon lizardfolk in ways we haven’t had the opportunity\
  \ to do so until now. There have been hints of a more robust lizardfolk culture\
  \ scattered across multiple Paizo products, but oftentimes, those hints never coalesced\
  \ into anything tangible for the PCs to encounter during adventures. Most meetings\
  \ with the iruxi follow the exact same template—an isolated tribe of lizardfolk\
  \ living in simple, ramshackle huts in the middle of a jungle or swamp.</p> \n \

  \   </div> \n     <p>When outlining the iruxi entry for the <i>Lost Omens Character\
  \ Guide</i>, I asked for something that was truly primordial. Much like crocodiles\
  \ or sharks, lizardfolk have been present on Golarion for spans of time that are\
  \ unfathomable to the human mindset. Iruxi are old enough that some of their treasured\
  \ ancestors are actually fossils. They had nations that were ancient before the\
  \ elves even set foot on the planet, and they survived through the destruction of\
  \ Earthfall not by fleeing or by magic, but by simple virtue of their nature as\
  \ highly adapted predators. They may not have changed in millions—or even billions—\
  of years, but that’s because they’re so well-evolved for their lifestyle that they\
  \ haven’t needed to.</p> \n     <p>(Though if we follow the crocodile and shark\
  \ metaphors too far, that might imply the existence of titanic lizardfolk that existed\
  \ in prehistoric times. Eek!)</p> \n     <p>With the inexorable advance of faster-lived\
  \ mammalian peoples across the globe, however, the iruxi are finding they cannot\
  \ keep solely to themselves and their old ways anymore. Lizardfolk have so far preferred\
  \ to be patient and think things through thoroughly before acting, but the tide\
  \ is starting to turn, and more iruxi are turning their gaze to collaboration with\
  \ other civilizations. Like hobgoblins and leshies, lizardfolk are an Uncommon ancestry.\
  \ They are most welcome in lands such as the Mwangi Expanse, where the iruxi nation\
  \ of Droon in southern Garund is a well-known fact, or in lawless wilds such as\
  \ the River Kingdoms or the deserts of the Golden Road. While an iruxi might find\
  \ acceptance elsewhere, many people react to lizardfolk in the same way that they\
  \ might respond to finding a large alligator lying on their sofa and wearing their\
  \ slippers. That is to say, for all you reptile fans out there who are about to\
  \ claim to be delighted by such a thing, not well. </p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ Jane Parajon</p> \n     </div> \n     <p>Lizardfolk get 8 Hit Points from their\
  \ ancestry, are Medium, and have a speed of 25 feet. A lizardfolk speaks Common\
  \ and Iruxi, plus any additional languages they might pick up. As apex predators,\
  \ they get an ability boost to Strength, and their incredible patience in the face\
  \ of pressure and adversary gets them another ability boost in Wisdom. They also\
  \ get one free ability boost to put in any score. Much like snakes, sharks, and\
  \ crocodiles, lizardfolk don’t tend to focus much on knowledge outside of the practical,\
  \ so they get an ability flaw to Intelligence. Neither lizardfolk nor their unfortunate\
  \ prey consider this much of a weakness, however—lizardfolk are hard to fool, possess\
  \ razor sharp claws that grant them an unarmed strike, and have the ability to hold\
  \ their breath for a long time while they quietly lie in wait.</p> \n     <p>Many\
  \ iruxi ancestry feats focus on enhancing their physical prowess, as they learn\
  \ to adapt their formidable natural abilities to an adventuring lifestyle. Iruxi\
  \ can gain a powerful tail whip attack, use their affinity for natural terrain to\
  \ catch foes off balance, and further hone their skills with unarmed combat. They\
  \ also have a few reptilian tricks up their sleeves, such as the ability granted\
  \ by the following ancestry feat:</p> \n     <div style=\"border:2px solid #5d0104;\

  \ \n     <p>Along with suggestions for some common <i>Core Rulebook</i> backgrounds\
  \ appropriate for lizardfolk, the iruxi ancestry entry also notes lizardfolk culture’\
  s love of astrology. As one of the first societies to master telling time by the\
  \ stars, astrological divination followed soon after, and has become both a point\
  \ of pride and a way of life to most iruxi. This love of astronomy has found lizardfolk\
  \ a few friends in the form of displaced Lirgeni astrologers, and GMs might even\
  \ consider allowing iruxi PCs to take Lirgeni human astrology feats present in earlier\
