  \ they would like to showcase, so that new fans of their work could find other projects,\
  \ RPG products, websites, livestreams, and more to enjoy!</p> \n     <p>And if you\
  \ enjoy something, consider telling the creator about it! Many people have the misconception,\
  \ born from admiration, that artists and authors are buried in compliments. Sadly,\

  \ low-effort denigration. Support the things you love, to better let them thrive!</p>\

  ую, уважаемые читатели! My name is Mikhail Sergeyevich Rekun, and I wrote a number\
  \ of pieces throughout the book, though most notably the Ghoran ancestry and the\
  \ History section, as well as the Introduction, the very first words you see in\
  \ the book.</p> \n     <p>History in fantasy is always an interesting challenge,\
  \ because it doesn't really resemble “real” history very much. People on Earth are\
  \ crazy, chaotic, and unruly, with societies changing, merging, and falling apart\
  \ in a matter of generations. Fantasy however adores its grand sweeps and imagined\
  \ antiquity, and few places in Golarion showcase that as strongly as the Impossible\
  \ Lands, where Geb and Nex continue a war that in our world would predate the invention\
  \ of written language. On the other hand, we don't have any immortal wizards roaming\
  \ around, so one wonders what life would be like if Sargon or Menes still had a\
  \ say in things.</p> \n     <p>If strange histories are your thing, I’m also the\
  \ creative director of the Luminant Age project, a Weird Swashbuckler setting in\
  \ which history has a tendency to be bitey and aggressive, and Survivors of the\
  \ earlier age are one of the great boogeymen of the world. If that interests you\
  \ at all (you know it does), please follow us on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LuminantA\"\

  \ \n     <h3>Michael Sayre</h3> \n     <p>Hi, I'm Michael Sayre, a design manager\
  \ here at Paizo and a contributor to <em>Lost Omens Impossible Lands</em>! I wrote\
  \ the Bhopan section and most of the accompanying mechanics, the kashrishi ancestry,\
  \ and a few other things, as well as some additional design and development on the\
  \ project. <em>Impossible Lands</em> is such an amazing book, I was thrilled at\
  \ the opportunity to be a part of it and to have my work placed alongside that of\
  \ so many other talented and creative people. I'm really looking forward to using\
  \ more of the Impossible Lands in my own future adventures. You can follow me on\
  \ Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MichaelJSayre1\">@MichaelJSayre1</a>\
  \ for random design insights, video game thoughts, and whatever I happen to think\
  \ is worth sharing. </p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Shao Han</h3> \n     <p>I'm Shao\
  \ Han (绍涵), an academic-turned–game designer from Singapore. This marks the first\
  \ time I've contributed so much for a Pathfinder Second Edition project. I hope\
  \ long-time fans and new players alike will find something to enjoy in this book!</p>\
  \ \n     <p>I'm especially grateful for the tremendous opportunity to update Alkenstar\
  \ and Dongun Hold! As a 40-something citizen of a small nation focused on diplomacy\
  \ and technocracy, I brought in my formative experiences growing up during the Cold\
  \ War to evoke the tensions of buffer polities caught in the Impossible Lands' uncertain\
  \ détente and escalating saber-rattling. I've also imagined large-scale, lasting\
  \ effects of magical war and technological development on the region's societies\
  \ and politics.</p> \n     <p>I also enjoyed designing new mechanics for the Impossible\
  \ Lands: gunslinging options, fleshwarp ancestries and feats, as well as fleshforged\
  \ creatures!</p> \n     <p>My personal favorite creation in this book? The existential\
  \ struggles of the fleshforged skinskitter. OK, wait, no, it's the cats of Dongun\
  \ Hold. If you've seen social media posts about cats in this book... well... Mewbe\
  \ you have a feline of what we are kittying in store for you!</p> \n     <p>You\

  \  <p>Heyo! I’m Ruvaid Virk and I’ve been a freelancer with Paizo for a little over\
  \ two years now. For <em>Impossible Lands</em>, I got to revisit vishkanyas, which\
  \ were part of my very first assignment in <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq027mn?Pathfinder-Bestiary-3\"\
  ><em>Bestiary 3</em></a>, and turn them into a full-fledged ancestry! I also wrote\
  \ the deity entries for Chamidu and Ragdya, and the bestiary entry for ratajin.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>My biggest contribution however was in the Jalmeray section. I\
  \ split the city of Niswan with fellow author Saif Ansari, and wrote the Introduction,\
  \ A Day in Niswan, a Year in Niswan, the People of Niswan, Culture, and Locations\
  \ sections. In the Adventuring in Jalmeray section, I wrote the ceru familiar, new\
  \ weapons, and the new updates to the Student of Perfection archetype! Being Pakistani,\
  \ Jalmeray is rather important to me, and being able to see my heritage reflected\
  \ in these pages means more than I can put into words. </p> \n     <p>If you’d like\
  \ to follow me or read more about my work, I’m on twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Darth_Ruvaider\"\

  ><em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #161: Belly of the Black Whale</em></a>, and am known\

  \ <em>Brinkwood: The Blood of Tyrants</em>; <em>Dolmenwood</em>; and <em>Academies\
