  ></a>\n     <br> <i>\"Can do! Can do!\" This forum says the horse \"can do.\"</i>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>After listening to all sides of the debate for several months,\
  \ we decided to make a change. As of <a href=\"/paizo/faq/v5748nruor1h4#v5748eaic9u1q\"\
  >today's post</a> on the <a href=\"/paizo/faq/v5748nruor1h4\">Wrath FAQ</a>, the\
  \ power has been rewritten as \"Recharge <i>a weapon or an armor</i> (▢ or put it\
  \ on top of your deck) to search your deck or discard pile for a card that has the\
  \ Mount trait and add it to your hand.\" That slows Alain down, though not so much\
  \ that he doesn't get anything out of the power.</p> \n    <p>Similarly, we saw\
  \ <a href=\"/threads/rzs2szf2\">an exploit with Imrijka</a> that we didn't like\
  \ much either. So we <a href=\"/paizo/faq/v5748nruor1h4#v5748eaic9u1o\">fixed that\
  \ too</a>. That only took us a month to consider.</p> \n    <p>\"Wait,\" you say,\
  \ \"did you say '<i>only</i> a month?'\" Uh-huh. Sometimes we don't make changes\
  \ until months after we see the first signs of a problem—usually after Vic writes\
  \ a quick response that starts with the word \"Sigh.\" We don't panic, because you\
  \ guys are smart. We expect you to make it through house-ruling it your own way,\
  \ obeying the social contract while you prompt us for answers. We're not coming\
  \ to your house and writing on your cards.</p> \n    <p>Instead, we begin a process.\
  \ Some people don't understand why it takes as long as it does. The reason is that\
  \ unlike the rulebook—which we've committed to being a living, breathing, evolving\
  \ document—our cards don't just update themselves. There's a real overhead to errata\
  \ that you, the player, have to hold in your head. So we don't change something\
  \ unless we need to. And when we do, there are several types of FAQ entries we could\
  \ write. We treat them very differently from each other. Here they are.</p> \n \
  \   <h2>Type 1: It's So Trivial, We're Not Even Gonna Mention It</h2> \n    <p>We\
  \ have several human beings that proof our cards. Human beings miss things. Usually\
  \ pretty trivial things. So maybe we forget how to spell the name Eustoyriax midway\
  \ through editing an adventure or even a single card. Or maybe there's this extremely\
  \ little problem on Infinite Rod.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a\
  \ href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6023-GauntletOfRuin.jpg\"\

  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6026-InfiniteRod_120.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Eustoyriax is happy to to see you.</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>See\
  \ that line \"You may discard this card to to add 2 dice to any check to defeat\
  \ a barrier?\" You can probably see the double \"to\" glaring you in the face now.\
  \ Well, we didn't see that when we were proofing. So when I did spot it, we just\
  \ fixed it in our file and never mentioned it on the <a href=\"/paizo/faq/v5748nruor1h4\"\
  >Wrath FAQ page</a>. When we fix mistakes that have no meaningful impact on the\
  \ game itself, we don't feel a need to bring it up. But if we ever print that card\
  \ again, it'll be correct.</p> \n    <h2>Type 2: It's Dumb, but Meaningful, and\
  \ We Should Just Fix It</h2> \n    <p>Sometimes we just bollix up some words. We\
  \ might <a href=\"/paizo/faq/v5748nruor1h4#v5748eaic9tzn\">banish a card we mean\
  \ to discard</a>, for example, or <a href=\"/paizo/faq/v5748nruor1h4#v5748eaic9tzq\"\
  >call something an Item</a> when we meant an Object. An easy example is <a href=\"\
  /paizo/faq/v5748nruor1gk#v5748eaic9tye\">the Horsechopper +1 entry</a>.</p> \n \
  \   <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-PR-Horsechopper.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-PR-Horsechopper_120.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Seems like something got chopped.</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>We\
  \ forgot the Polearm trait. Since Raz and Tontelizi have powers that care about\
  \ the Polearm trait, it's a meaningful omission. It's an easy fix, so we make it\
  \ as soon as we can. If the card has already been released, we do it right away,\
  \ and if the card isn't out yet, we put it in a queue to add to the FAQ on release.\
  \ (The \"change the Item trait to the Object trait\" entry was in the queue for\
  \ seven months before the cards it affected were released.)</p> \n    <p>Quite honestly,\
  \ we hate these things. There shouldn't be any of them. But we have thousands of\
  \ cards, and we screw up some words sometimes. When we mess up, we fess up.</p>\
  \ \n    <h2>Type 3: It's Bizarre and Maybe We Should Fix It</h2> \n    <p>With thousands\
  \ of cards, we try hard to see how they will all interact. Sometimes you guys find\
  \ things that surprise us. Really strange things.</p> \n    <p>Another <a href=\"\
  /paizo/faq/v5748nruor1gk#v5748eaic9u1n\">errata we issued today</a> was for <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy921l\"><em>Rise of the Runelords Adventure 4—Fortress of the Stone\
  \ Giants</em></a>. A <a href=\"/threads/rzs2s4nu\">particularly bizarre combination\
  \ of cards</a>—the scenario The Ancient Library, the henchman The Headless Lord,\
  \ and Kyra's Fireflower role in the <a href=\"/products/btpy97ia\"><em>Cleric Class\
  \ Deck</em></a>—produces a situation where, if you can defeat the Headless Lord\
  \ with a weapon that has the Sword trait, you might be able to put all the armor\
  \ from the game box into your deck.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    \

  \    <p>This is the kind of thing we have to think about before acting. We'll consider\
  \ how likely it is to occur, how damaging it is, and how much fun it sucks out of\
  \ the game. In this particular case, we almost didn't make the change. But then\
  \ we looked at some of the armor that's showing up in our class decks and realized\
  \ that's not something we want to see just pop into your hand. So we killed it.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>But then sometimes we don't. An unthinkable card combo made us question\
  \ what would happen if you Disintegrated the undefeatable dragon turtle henchman\
  \ Hirgenzosk in the scenario Into the Runeforge—which, y'know, is never gonna happen—\
  and we figured that wouldn't ever get to the step of shuffling Hirgy into his location\
  \ deck, but then we had to look at the Jorgenfist Stone Giant, which also worked\
  \ and then we—man, even I'm confused. Anyway, it all worked as intended so we left\
  \ it alone because for criminy's sake, we have better things to do with our days.</p>\

  \ four-legged friends seemed fine to us. But you guys <a href=\"/threads/rzs2sd9p\"\
  >thought</a> they <i>required</i> another character to move with you for you to\
  \ use their power. We didn't want that, so we quickly came up with another wording:\
  \ \"Discard this card at the end of your turn to move; you may also move another\
  \ character at your location to your new location.\" We applied that to all the\
  \ cards as soon as they came out.</p> \n    <p>If only it was always that easy.</p>\
  \ \n    <h2>Type 5: It's Bad, but We Don't Know How to Fix It, So We'll See What\
  \ We Can Do</h2> \n    <p>This category includes the majority of the issues that\
  \ are still open in our bug tracking database. (Yep—we deal with these issues <i>exactly</i>\
  \ the same way that software developers track bugs.) Sometimes the discussion goes\
  \ on for a while. We know something has to change, but changing it could cause other\
  \ problems. So we keep working on it until we have an ironclad answer.</p> \n  \
  \  <p>We're still trying to figure out what happens when you <a href=\"/threads/rzs2sb6g\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Y'all are working my one good nerve.</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>There's\
  \ always something vexing us. Don't worry. We'll eventually figure it out. But it\
  \ can take months. Sometimes, issues that seem small have bigger effects on things\
  \ we're working on for future sets, so we have to consider (and sometimes redesign)\
  \ piles of cards you haven't seen yet before we consider the problem solved. A few\
  \ of these issues have been open for over a year, and a few of them have been closed\
  \ and reopened more times than I care to remember. Big games can have lots of little\
  \ holes.</p> \n    <h2>Type 6: It Wasn't Broken Until We Fixed Something Else, and\
  \ Now We Have to Deal With It</h2> \n    <p>We used to think the powers box wasn't\
  \ something you'd ever need to look at when you played the Runelords spell Summon\
  \ Monster. You'd just pull a monster out, look at its difficulty, and throw it at\
  \ whatever you were facing. But then it became clear that <a href=\"/threads/rzs2rhtq\"\
  >the Veteran trait might matter</a>. If you pulled out a Mercenary in Adventure\
  \ 6, you wouldn't want him to have a difficulty of 10. And what if you pulled out\
  \ a Giant when the Giant Lair was in play? We needed to address that in the rules.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>So we made a rule that made \"passive\" difficulty mods work—that is,\
  \ not those that happened before, while, or after you acted. That ruling was nice\
  \ and clean, but <i>every single Lycanthrope</i> was worded in a way that didn't\
  \ work with this change. And that meant there were now eight cards to errata. So\
  \ we did it in <a href=\"/paizo/faq/v5748nruor1gu#v5748eaic9sqa\">one sweeping FAQ\
  \ entry</a>.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6005-SummonMonster.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Gaby just grinned and doesn't know why.</i>\n    </div> \n \
  \   <p>These sorts of changes are likely to become more common as the game becomes\
  \ deeper. For example, we're going to put the Electricity trait on Lightning Elemental\
  \ and Comozant Wyrd from Skull &amp; Shackles, and it isn't because there's anything\
  \ wrong with that set. It's because it will matter next year when Mummy's Mask comes\
  \ out. It will matter a lot.</p> \n    <h2>Type 7: It's Bad, but The Real Problem\
  \ is Something Else</h2> \n    <p>This is a tough type of problem. Players think\
  \ they have found a problem, but the thing that they think is at fault is working\
  \ just fine. It's something else buried in the system that doesn't work, and we\
  \ need to figure out what.</p> \n    <p>At the risk of causing some cardiac events,\
  \ let's talk about The Elven Entanglement. It's probably your least favorite scenario,\
  \ at least until you beat it. It's part of a very hard set of B scenarios for Wrath\
  \ prompted by continued statements from players that the B scenarios in our previous\
  \ two sets were too easy. So we built a set with a different power curve, one that\
  \ was hard at the start, but if you beat it, you were well prepared for what was\
  \ coming your way in adventure 1.</p> \n    <p>The problem was, The Elven Entanglement—\
  the second scenario in the whole game—looked really broken. Nowhere on either the\
  \ scenario or the henchmen was there a way to close a location. That meant winning\
  \ the scenario was super-difficult. So people assumed we meant for the Tangle Traps\
  \ to have \"close the location\" text, but we didn't. We intended the Tangle Traps\
  \ to be \"passive\" henchmen; they're just vines, so they don't let you close the\
  \ location. The problem wasn't with them. It was with the cohort Vinst.</p> \n \

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>All tangled up.</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>The intent here was\
  \ that you couldn't close the locations the normal way. Instead, you'd sacrifice\
  \ an exploration to fight a Fiendish Tree; if you beat it, your buddy Vinst would\
  \ show up. If he was around when you beat a Tangle Trap, you could auto-close the\
  \ location, and then Vinst would scamper away. Rinse, repeat. That would have worked...\
  \ except Vinst was worded as \"When you would <i>attempt</i> to close a location,\"\
  \ and that attempt would never happen. So people didn't see the point of Vinst in\
  \ the scenario and never went for the Tree.</p> \n    <p>It took six months for\
  \ us to realize what the problem here was. <a href=\"/paizo/faq/v5748nruor1h4#v5748eaic9u1r\"\
  >Now we've fixed it.</a> Enjoy your Fiendish Trees.</p> \n    <h2>Type 8: It's Not\
  \ Necessarily Bad, but Some People Really Don't Like It</h2> \n    <p>And while\
  \ we're on that subject, let's address the elephant in the room: Are the B scenarios\
  \ in Wrath really too hard? Well, some people love the increased peril, and they\
  \ tell us that we finally gave them the challenge they wanted. But other people\
  \ hate it; they write about unfairness and random damage. They specifically focus\
  \ on these three cards.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-ArborealBlight.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Everyone's favorite cards.</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>So what\
  \ to do when some people want one thing and others want another? Well, maybe there's\
  \ a way we can have our cake and eat it too. We're introducing a new type of errata\
  \ today: the optional kind. <a href=\"/paizo/faq/v5748nruor1h4#v5748eaic9u1s\">This\
  \ entry</a> has a different flavor to it. It offers a set of changes that involve\
  \ swapping some cards from one deck to another, and yes, maybe even giving Tangle\
  \ Traps the ability to let you close locations. We're not going to make an errata\
  \ deck for these cards, because we're not requiring you to play this way. (Also,\
  \ Vic notes, the \"close the location\" text won't actually <i>fit</i> on the Tangle\
  \ Trap card.)</p> \n    <h2>Type 9: It's Bad, but Some People Really Love It</h2>\
  \ \n    <p>I speak often about the dual approaches to game design being the \"dessert\
  \ bar\" approach and the \"salad bar\" approach. Dessert bar games give you very\
  \ few impediments to success and are pretty much empty calories. Salad bar games\
  \ are a lot less sweet for you, but you might actually be around longer if you play\
  \ them. PACG is obviously a salad bar game.</p> \n    <p>But sometimes we give you\
  \ too much dessert. In very rare cases, we have to think about \"nerfing\" something.\
  \ Nerfing is the process of taking something that is written exactly how we intended\
  \ but causes a potential power imbalance in the game. It's not something we can\
  \ just ignore (unlike, say, the asinine Headless Lord thing above), but changing\
  \ it means actually worsening the play experience for some people. Or at least it\
  \ means something they've played with won't be the same when they play with it again,\
  \ and usually \"in the house's favor.\"</p> \n    <p>We've only done this a few\
  \ times. Our tone is often very different when we make a change like this. For example,\
  \ <a href=\"/paizo/faq/v5748nruor1gk#v5748eaic9rtc\">Restoration</a>. We know you\
  \ don't want to play in a manner that doesn't advance the game at all until you\
  \ win it in one mirthless sweep. But because of organized play and just general\
  \ courtesy, we can't let <i>anyone</i> do that. So we nuked it from orbit. <a href=\"\
  /paizo/faq/v5748nruor1gv#v5748eaic9ted\">Arabundi</a> had a problem like this, and\
  \ so did <a href=\"/paizo/faq/v5748nruor1gv#v5748eaic9sfx\">Radillo</a>. We nuked\
  \ those too. But not till after we spent a long time debating whether we wanted\

  \ back to Alain and Imrijka. After weighing what people were doing in play and then\
  \ testing them over and over ourselves, we decided the game would be better if people\
  \ were playing a different way. So Alain can't do all of his mounted shenanigans\
  \ any more, and Imrijka can't ignore the blessings deck entirely. Those were tough\
  \ choices, but we made the decisions to nerf them and move on.</p> \n    <p>This\
  \ won't be the last time we errata something. We've done it before and we hope to\
  \ have to do it less over time. But whenever we do it, we make sure we're ready\
  \ to do so before we post anything. Because the last thing we want is someone playing\
  \ incorrectly because we need to errata our errata.</p> \n    <p>And I want to end\
  \ on this note. None of this happens without your help. Your posts to the forums\
  \ have helped us clarify and correct and just really understand the colossal game\
  \ we've unleashed on the world. Everyone on the design team really appreciates it...\
