  \ of the Broken Towers</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, May 13, 2008</p> \n\
  \    <p>In trying to choose a topic for today's blog post on <a href=\"/search?q=leigh+brackett\"\
  >Leigh Brackett's</a> <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7zdr\"><i>The Ginger Star</i></a>,\
  \ I had a rough time. After raving about Brackett's prose in my last post, I knew\
  \ that I wanted to share an excerpt—but which one? The scene depicted on the cover,\
  \ where Stark and the mysterious wise woman face execution? Perhaps his fight with\
  \ the Children of the Sea? Or his escape from the subterranean world of humanity's\
  \ ferret-faced descendants? Eventually, though, I realized that there's one scene\
  \ in particular which stands out in my mind whenever I'm thinking about this book:\
  \ the first appearance of the Corn King, after Stark's been captured by the treacherous\
  \ trader Amnir. While it's a bit longer than the usual excerpts we post here, I\
  \ hope you'll find it as captivating as I do.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>Amnir\
  \ rode along the line of wagons. \"Close up there. Close up. Smartly now! Let them\
  \ see your weapons. On your guard, watch my lance point, and keep moving.\" </p>\
  \ \n     <p>The broken towers were grouped around an open circle, which had a huge\
  \ lump of something in the middle that might once have been a monument to civic\
  \ pride. Three figures stood beside the monument. They were gaunt. Tuck-bellied,\
  \ long-armed, slightly stooped. They wore tight-fitting garments of an indeterminate\
  \ gray color, hoods covering narrow heads. Their faces were masked against the wind.\
  \ The masks were worked in darker threads with what appeared to be symbols of rank.\
  \ The three stood immobile, alone, and the ragged doorways of the buildings gaped\
  \ darkly on either hand. </p> \n     <p>Stark's nostrils twitched. A smell of living\
  \ came to him from those doorways—a dry subtle taint of close-packed bodies, of\
  \ smoke and penned animals, of dung and wool and unnamable foods. He was riding\
  \ in his usual place beside the third wagon in line. Gerrith was behind him, beside\
  \ the fourth; the other captives strung out behind her, except for Halk, who was\
  \ still confined. Stark tugged nervously at his bonds, and the armed man who led\
  \ his beast thumped him with his lance butt and bade him be still. </p> \n     <p>The\
  \ noise of the wagons rolled against the silence. Amnir rode aside, toward the three\
  \ gray figures. Men came after him bearing sacks and bales and rolls of cloth. </p>\
  \ \n     <p>Amnir halted and raised his hand. The hand held a lance, point upward.\
  \ </p> \n     <p> \"May Old Sun give you light and warmth, Hargoth.\" </p> \n  \
  \   <p> \"There is neither here,\" said the foremost figure. Only his eyes and his\
  \ mouth showed. The eyes were pale and unreadable. Above them, on the forehead of\
  \ the mask, was the winged-disc sun-symbol, which Stark had found to be almost universal.\
  \ On the sides of the mask, covering the cheeks, were stylized grain patterns. Stark\
  \ supposed the man was both chief and high priest. It was strange to find a Corn\
  \ King here, where no corn had grown for centuries. The man's mouth had thin lips\
  \ and very sharp teeth. His voice was high and reedy but it had a carrying quality,\
  \ a note of authority. </p> \n     <p> \"Here there are only my lord Darkness, and\
  \ his lady Cold, and their daughter Hunger.\" </p> \n     <p> \"I have brought you\
  \ gifts,\" said Amnir. </p> \n     <p>And the Corn King said, \"This time, you have\
  \ brought us more.\" </p> \n     <p>The wind blew his words away. But Amnir's lance\
  \ point dipped and a movement began along the line of wagons, a bristling of weapons.\
  \ The man leading Stark's beast shortened up on the rein. </p> \n     <p>In a curiously\
  \ flat tone Amnir said, \"I don't take your meaning.\" </p> \n     <p> \"Why should\
  \ you?\" said the Corn King. \"You have not the Sight. But I have seen. I have seen\
  \ it in the Winter Dreaming. I have seen it in the entrails of the Spring Child\
  \ that we give each year to Old Sun. I have seen it in the stars. Our guide has\
  \ come, the Promised One who will lead us into the far heavens, into warmth and\
  \ light. He is with you now.\" A long slender arm shot out and pointed straight\
  \ at Stark. \"Give him to us.\" </p> \n     <p> \"I do not understand you,\" Amnir\
  \ said. \"I have only captives from the south, to be sold as slaves to the Thyrans.\"\
  \ </p> \n     <p>The lance point dipped lower. The pace of the wagons quickened.\
  \ </p> \n     <p> \"You lie,\" said the Corn King. \"You will sell them to the Citadel.\
  \ Word has come from the high north, both truth and lies, and we know the difference.\
  \ There are strangers on Skaith, and the star-roads are open. We have waited through\
  \ the long night, and now it is morning.\" </p> \n     <p>As though in answer, the\
  \ first sullen glimmer of dawn stained the eastern sky. </p> \n     <p> \"Give us\
  \ our guide now. Only death waits for him in the high north.\" </p> \n     <p>Stark\
  \ shouted, \"What word have you of strangers?\" </p> \n     <p>The armed man clouted\
  \ him hard across the head with the lance butt. Amnir voiced a shrill cry, reining\
  \ his beast around, and the wagons began to move, faster and faster, the teams slipping\
  \ and scrabbling on the frosty ground...</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p> James\
