  > \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Greetings! I'm Keith Richmond, the newest member\
  \ of the Adventure Card Game design team. I joined during the middle of work on\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/wrathOfTheRighteous\"><em>Wrath of the\
  \ Righteous</em></a>, but you'll see more of my work in the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/classDecks\"\
  >Class Decks</a> and future sets. I'm super excited about the work I'm doing on\
  \ a set I can't tell you about until next year.</p> \n    <p>Chad believes that\
  \ <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lhdj\">Seelah is the best PACG character ever</a>,\
  \ even as he admits that no one agrees with him. Mike believes that <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lhem\"\
  >Darago is the best ever</a>, despite Darago's problems when he can't find enough\
  \ undead minions. Enora, the best character in <em>Wrath</em>, is here to show you\
  \ utterly deluded they are.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\

  \ \n    </div> \n    <p>Enora is an arcanist, a class that blends the best elements\
  \ of wizards and sorcerers. Her parents are both professors at the Occularium, and\
  \ she grew up studying in its libraries. She's a super-smart halfling whose curiosity\
  \ and luck led her to discover great cosmic power with hardly any downsides. It's\
  \ true that her devotion to Nethys would cause problems for her back home, but what\
  \ adventurer doesn't need a great reason to go on adventures? In terms of looks\
  \ alone, she's already beaten Darago. Check out her sweet robes!</p> \n    <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/IconicHeroes-OcculariumVestments.jpg\"\

  .jpeg\"></a> \n    </div> \n    <p>The true flaw in Chad's pick is that Seelah isn't\
  \ a real caster. True casters are both the most powerful and the most versatile\
  \ characters in the Pathfinder ACG, just as they are in the RPG. It's true that\
  \ they require more care and planning, but that pays off in so many ways. Spells,\
  \ especially the mythic ones found in <em>Wrath of the Righteous</em>, can be powerful\
  \ because they're not just revealed. Instead, you choose when and where they're\
  \ most effective.</p> \n    <p>The best casters—and Enora is the best of the best—\
  never need to worry about failing to recharge their spells. You can set up a card\
  \ engine, constantly cycling your deck as you cast spells. An optimal use of this\
  \ engine, modified by the unique nature of each caster, enables you to have the\
  \ right cards when they are most needed. Your greater hand size ensures you have\
  \ more solutions available, and the added perception of danger makes the game more\
  \ exciting. At the end of the day, being fragile only truly matters when you fail,\
  \ and Enora has enough tricks to ensure success.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-EnoraFront.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-EnoraFront_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-EnoraBack.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-EnoraBack_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n    </div> \n    <p>Enora uses her best skill, Knowledge, to acquire spells\
  \ and items, the boons most useful to her. This can be a scenario saver when used\
  \ to acquire Divine spells (such as Cure) that she can use as scrolls or to give\
  \ to her friends. Enora is a caster's caster who never runs out of spells. Her second\
  \ power is a beautiful cycle mechanic to recharge a spell from her discard pile\
  \ whenever she casts a spell. This means it's safe to discard spells to absorb damage,\
  \ since they'll be back soon enough. Check off a power feat, and she can even extend\
  \ her magical shields to protect her friends. This is particularly helpful against\
  \ \"before you act\" damage, a common trick of dragons and demons.</p> \n    <p>Enora's\
  \ deck is unburdened by dead or filler cards such as armor or weapons. She can focus\
  \ fully on her love of spells and items, and by items, I mostly mean books. Like\
  \ Enora, I love books, but instead of using them to escape reality, she uses them\
  \ to <b>rewrite</b> reality. How awesome is that? Many books are recharged with\
  \ Knowledge, so she can cycle them just like spells. The remainder of her deck,\
  \ allies and blessings, can be used for extra explorations.</p> \n    <p>My first\
  \ development task when I joined the team was to brainstorm ideas for Wrath of the\
  \ Righteous roles. I'll admit the rest of the team had some grueling work to hack\
  \ my gibberish into sensible mechanics, so I didn't help as much as I might have\
  \ hoped. That said, Enora barely required any modification. Everyone knew she was\
  \ just too awesome to change. She has two solid role choices: expand her mastery\
  \ of the arcane as an Eldritch Savant or grab a library card and learn <i>all the\
  \ things</i> as an Occularium Scholar.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n \
  \    <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-EldritchSavant.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-EldritchSavant_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n    </div> \n    <p>As an Eldritch Savant, Enora gains power feats to fine-tune\
  \ her casting engine. She can learn to cycle spells into her hand and shuffle spells\
  \ into her deck instead of recharging them. She also gains the ability to bypass\
  \ any pesky defenses the demons of the Worldwound might possess by changing the\
  \ energy types of her spells. This ability is even sweeter when you use it to exploit\
  \ a monster's vulnerability.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\
  //static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-OcculariumScholar.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-OcculariumScholar_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n    </div> \n    <p>Knowledge is power, and Enora the Occularium Scholar\
  \ and her books hold all the knowledge. She can cite page and passage to overcome\
  \ any barrier. With her divinations and tomes of lore, she can determine the optimal\
  \ solution to any location's closing requirements and even do a little self-help.\
  \ Thankfully, <em>Wrath</em> features many books—and codices, handbooks, journals,\
  \ and tomes—for Enora to collect. I visualize her as venturing down into the Abyss\
  \ while constantly pulling out relevant guidebooks (perhaps carried for her by Seelah\
  \ or Darago.)</p> \n    <p>There's another really important reason why Enora is\
  \ the best <em>Wrath</em> character. Knowledge is the most important skill in <em>Wrath\
  \ of the Righteous</em>. This won't be obvious until you get to see more of the\
  \ horrible banes that await you, but many of them have a secret weakness that only\
  \ the most knowledgeable can exploit. Whether you're facing Baphomet's minotaurs\
  \ or Khorramzadeh's elder fire demons, Enora will prove that her pen is mightier\
  \ than any sword.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-DemonHuntersHandbook.jpg\"\

  \ you die now.</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>So that's my argument for Enora as the best\
  \ character ever. Accept no substitutes. We'll return to this debate in a month\
  \ or so, because Tanis has some delicious things to share with you about convention\
  \ season goodies!</p> \n    <p>Keith Richmond<br> <i>Adventure Card Game Developer</i></p>\
