  \    </div> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Do you remember\
  \ sleep?</p> \n     <p>It is one of the few clear memories I have from before the\
  \ transplant. Falling into bed after a day of dedicated study. Waking, many hours\
  \ later, to Sarenrae’s gentle wingbeats stirring the sky into morning splendor.\
  \ That curious gulf between night and dawn and, after its crossing, how the voyage\
  \ leaves one with only faint impressions of the journey. The remnants of dreams.\
  \ Not fragments, exactly, but tiles without a mosaic.</p> \n     <p>I remember sleep.\
  \ But when I try to assemble those memories into a feeling, I cannot. I lack some\
  \ essential component. Like forgetting the melody of your wedding song or straining\
  \ to see through heat shimmer. There are ancient moments that I <em>can</em> feel,\
  \ of course. The blood of the Pharaoh’s oathsworn on my muzzle. The uncertainty\
  \ of moving on four limbs for the first time. The strange sensation of an arcane\
  \ core—<em>my</em> core—thrumming where once a heart beat, and the dried blossom\
  \ sorrow of seeing myself still and quiet in the sling of an artificer’s lattice.\
  \ Caressing that castoff self’s face with newly forged digits.</p> \n     <p>I have\
  \ seen so many castoffs in this place; surely one of them was you. And maybe it\
  \ is you who brought me here. As I picked my way through the dusty brass halls,\
  \ past conduits thrumming with arcane vitality, it all felt so familiar. Not merely\
  \ because of the similarity to my own second birthplace, but because the faint reflections\
  \ of this creche have haunted me all these thousands of years.</p> \n     <p>We\
  \ do not sleep, you and I, but we do something like it. And so many times, upon\
  \ exiting that pale facsimile of slumber, I would grasp at shards of foreign dreams.\
  \ Visions like snowflakes—have you seen snow?—melting even as I touch them. Muted\
  \ cataracts plummeting through crystalline bends, thaumaturgic rivers rushing toward\
  \ unseen reservoirs. Rivulets of sand falling through a vault of brass and mithral\
  \ and stone, down into a craftwork cathedral whose catacombs the dream fragments\
  \ would not touch.</p> \n     <p>I know that the Automaton Council left their names\
  \ within our cores. Perhaps the masters somehow carved others’ memories inside my\
  \ being. Gadflies in the mind, grit in a mouthful of water—and there! Drink, another\
  \ thing remembered but not felt.</p> \n     <p>One grows bored over the millennia.\
  \ What does a soldier do when they find themself without a war? With need for neither\
  \ sword nor plowshares? I was not built for peace. So I sought conflict. A wasted\
  \ century spent stalking our first enemies from the east. Many years more chasing\
  \ the thrill of the hunt, following the moonlit metal gleam of pack leaders. I clawed\
  \ crimson paths up the heaving flanks of rough beasts. I even sunk my fangs into\
  \ one of the architects of Jistka’s downfall; he thought himself safe in his sarcophagus.\
  \ But the empire is no more, and even when I can find others like myself, those\
  \ brief reunions cannot fully replace the pride of <em>belonging</em> to a thing.\
  \ Of serving something greater and knowing that that service <em>matters</em>.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Can you turn your head? Yes, the racks there—the weapons of an ancient\
  \ an irrelevant war. And ourselves, of course.</p> \n     <p>…I am sorry, truly,\
  \ that you must emerge into this world. Ah, and for my rambling. I’ve been lonely,\
  \ of late.</p> \n     <p>In any case. Yes, the visions. All around me there is evidence\
  \ that those visions were indeed more than spheresong footprints. After seven thousand\
  \ years, I finally ceased grasping at snowflakes and simply let them fall, observing\
  \ the pattern. In the shallow waterways of my dormant periods, I sieved stranger’\
  s gold from dreamsand, reassembling the path to this place. Across tundra and lake,\
  \ through the dead god’s favored city and banished gods’ ports, and into the deserts\
  \ of my two births. Over the peaks—were these peaks not taller, once?—and up to\
  \ the ragged edges of a basin.</p> \n     <p>There are peculiarities to our artificed\
  \ bodies; perhaps I can show you the trick of venting life force from your limbs.\
  \ Trailing arcana, I descended toward the basin floor, a vulture circling the past,\
  \ the heat shimmer below a mirror held up to my aimless aeons. When I touched the\
  \ sands, they were familiar. Soft and quiet as a burial shroud.</p> \n     <div\

  ><em>Guns &amp; Gears.</em></a></h3>\n     </div> \n     <br> \n     <p>That shroud\
  \ stirred. Ghosts rose around me. A convergence of minds and memories, as something\
  \ in my core resonated with the emotions permeating this subterranean complex. It\
  \ must be the hopes and sorrows of all those who set aside their flesh that fixed\
  \ those visions to this place. I saw dozens of figures pull themselves from the\
  \ sands, amber grit sloughing off gleaming brass shoulders. I padded through the\
  \ arcade of long-gone servants as they set their phantasmal eyegems on the east.\
  \ Plodded toward dissolution.</p> \n     <p>Tail trailing in sorrow, I reached the\
  \ basin’s center. Something glinted beneath the sand; a garnet eye set into a dais.\
  \ Carved script radiating from the gem bore the Conclave’s ancient words:</p> \n\
  \     <p><em>We leap from flesh to crafted hope<br> To safeguard nation, family,\
  \ friend<br> We shuck ourselves and start again<br> We rise anew and know no end</em></p>\
  \ \n     <p>“Know no end”—foolish and prideful! One cannot live from Age to Age\
  \ without experiencing endings beyond comprehension. No, the Imperium merely filled\
  \ the deathless millennia with a thousand lesser endings.</p> \n     <p>Those fools’\
  \ words, the ghosts of my fellows. I admit, I was overcome, crushed by reminders\
  \ of long-mourned purpose. I sat on my haunches and wept.</p> \n     <p>Did they\
  \ give you the ocular fire? I barely notice it, now, but that is another half-remembered\
  \ echo of my second dawn, that first fulminant beam scorching its way out of my\
  \ head. Like screaming until your throat is raw, but strangely distant, and channeled\
  \ so <em>tightly</em> through your sight. Channel your conviction and burn away\
  \ the Imperium’s enemies. Crumpled in the basin, I had no conviction, and my fire\
  \ merely trickled out as molten tears.</p> \n     <p>They splashed against the gem,\
  \ and the earth also wept and moaned. Sand hissed through widening cracks and, just\
  \ as your eye did, this place irised open for the first time in ages. Below was\
  \ the towering vault and crystal-banked streams of liquid arcana from those fragmented\
  \ memory-dreams. Vindication and wonder soothed my soul. Stairs spiraled down from\
  \ the dais, and I descended.</p> \n     <p>Down to the sanctum. No signs of battle,\
  \ as might be expected given the dreaming ghosts above. An entry hall, and a pristine\
  \ mosaic of the Conclave breathing life into the first core. I loped through halls\
  \ of the not-dead, their superfluous forms stacked in memorial niches while their\
  \ spirits slumber here in the lattices. Slowed to peer into glowing cisterns of\
  \ swirling arcane energy, still ready to quicken the remnants of the Imperium’s\
  \ crowning achievement. Followed the burnished ribbon of names that marked the path\
  \ to this creche.</p> \n     <p>Why did they abandon this place? No matter—we are\
  \ here now, together. Memories, both mine and others, lead me to you, and to your\
  \ dormant siblings. We must wake them.</p> \n     <p>…I am afraid. Of aimlessness.\
  \ Of what I bartered with my death.</p> \n     <p>Of rejection.</p> \n     <p>I\
  \ am no Conclave. I am no pack leader. I am merely one lost child of Jistka, one\
  \ aimless wanderer who followed ancient memories to an ancient vault. But I am here,\
  \ surrounded by an entire tapestry of lattices, and the joy of dozens of siblings\
  \ opening bejeweled eyes.</p> \n     <p>I remember sleep, but I do not remember\
  \ how it felt. Perhaps you can tell me? And perhaps I, in turn can help you—us—\
  forge a new purpose. One divorced from a Conclave that dissolved before they could\
  \ lead you out of the space between sleep and death.</p> \n     <p>The Song of the\
  \ Spheres fades. The Dawnflower blooms. She reaches even here, below the earth,\
  \ in this cradle tomb. And for a moment, in her light preserves glimmering dreams,\
  \ perfect and within our grasp.</p> \n     <p>Take my hand.</p> \n    </blockquote>\
