  \ \n   <p>by Dave Gross</p> \n   <h2>Chapter Two: Token of Affection<br><i>Radovan</i></h2>\
  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p>\"Stand fast, varlet!\"</p> \n  \
  \  <p>I could hardly believe my ears. \"What did you say?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Don't\
  \ move.\" The bravo struck a pose and looked down his skinny sword at me.</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"That ain't what you said. What did you call me?\"</p> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"\
  description\">He sneered, probably thinking I couldn't hear his buddies creeping\
  \ up behind me. When I told the boss I was going out for some exercise, this wasn't\
  \ what I had in mind. The swordsman looked me in the eye. \"Varlet.\"</span></p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"That's what I thought.\" I crooked a finger. \"Why don't you come over\
  \ here and whisper it in my ear.\"</p> \n    <p>He slid a step closer before thinking\
  \ better of it. He had a good five inches of height on me. Along with the sword,\
  \ that gave him plenty of reach. In the narrow alley, that gave him one hell of\
  \ an advantage. Judging from the purses I saw dangling from his belt, it'd been\
  \ working out for him so far.</p> \n    <p>I could've put a dart in his eye, but\
  \ that would've spoiled the surprise for his buddies, who didn't know I knew where\
  \ they were. Besides, after the past year, I wasn't in much of a killing mood.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"When I hear a word like 'varlet,' I know I'm talking to a special kind\
  \ of guy,\" I said. \"The kind with a scented hanky in his cuff, maybe a monocle\
  \ just for show, a box of powdered tobacco to sniff off the back of his wrist. You\
  \ know the kind of guy I mean. In Cheliax, we'd call you a poet.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Mind your tongue, hellspawn, or I will give you such—\"</p> \n    <p>\"A poet'd\
  \ say 'thrashing.'\"</p> \n    <p>\"—a thrashing— Curse you, you insolent Chel!\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"I've got to hand it to you, though. You Absalom thugs dress better\
  \ than Egorian river rats.\" I sniffed at him. \"Smell nice, too. What's that, lilac\
  \ water?\"</p> \n    <p>\"How dare you! I am no thug. I am a gentleman. I keep the\
  \ streets of Absalom—\"</p> \n    <p>\"Alleys.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I keep them clean\
  \ of scum like you.\"</p> \n    <p>I nodded at the purses on his belt. \"And charge\
  \ us for the privilege, yeah?\"</p> \n    <p>For a second he lost his tough and\
  \ looked past me at his partners. His eyes told me I'd guessed right when I heard\
  \ their boots scrape the cobblestones: there were two moving in, one on either side.\
  \ They needed a little more time, so I vamped.</p> \n    <p>\"So you want my purse?\
  \ What about my fancy new jacket? You wouldn't believe how much it cost. I had it\
  \ made in a city on the other side of the world, ten times bigger than this little\
  \ hamlet.\" I showed off the dragon running down either sleeve, the monkey and the\
  \ swordswoman tooled on the chest. I imagined the backstabbers checking out the\
  \ phoenix on the back. \"On the other hand, it's a bit wide in the shoulders for\
  \ a skinny little poet like you. You ever lift anything heavier than that toothpicker?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"You'll eat those words—\"</p> \n    <p>The guy on my left made his\
  \ move. I whipped around to put a spur in his belly. Lucky for him, I caught him\
  \ in his big thick belt. The sharp bone jutting from my elbow didn't perforate him,\
  \ but it knocked the wind out of him.</p> \n    <p>The second guy lunged for where\
  \ I wasn't standing anymore. I threw out my leg in a move my late \"master\" called\
  \ Sweeping the Grass. For the first time I realized that name didn't make any sense.\
  \ Who sweeps the grass? It should've been Sweeping the Porch or the Sweeping the\
  \ Street or something. Maybe I'd rename it now that the old bastard was gone to\
  \ Hell and I wasn't. Not yet.</p> \n    <p>When I took out his legs, the second\
  \ mook hit the cobblestones hard. He tried to stand but slipped in a pile of garbage,\
  \ raising a terrific stink before falling again.</p> \n    <p>While I was dancing\
  \ with his friends, the gentleman moved in to take a stab at me. I tugged the first\
  \ goon over by the belt, careful to let his pal's sword miss the important parts.\
  \ That's the kind of guy I am: considerate of others' feelings. Not that you'd believe\
  \ it from the guy's yowling.</p> \n    <p>\"Desna weeps.\" For all I knew, the city\
  \ guard showed up in Absalom alleys. I was going to have to wrap this up. </p> \n\
  \    <p>The second knucklehead tried to get up, so I gave him a rap on the noggin.\
  \ The bleeder sat on the alley floor, clutching his belly and wailing.</p> \n  \
  \  <p>\"Shut up, you, or I'll give you something to cry about.\" Maybe I didn't\
  \ want to kill these jerks, but he was testing my resolve.</p> \n    <p>I grabbed\
  \ the blades they'd dropped and saw the bloodstains. They'd used these knives recently.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"You aren't just robbers,\" I said. \"You're cutthroats.\"</p> \n  \
  \  <p>Gentleman took a step toward me. I showed him the big smile, and he froze.\
  \ </p> \n    <p>\"Stand still, knave. I will hold you here to answer to the city\
  \ guard.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Seriously? You want to explain these to the city guard?\"\
  \ I threw away the bloody knives and pocketed the stolen purses from the backstabbers.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The point of his sword drooped.</p> \n    <p>\"That's more like it. Now\
  \ hand over your loot.\"</p> \n    <p>The man had no guile. His feint was obvious.\
  \ Before his point came anywhere near me, I lunged below it, sitting splits in a\
  \ lunge the aforementioned late master called Monkey Plucks the Peaches.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Gentleman recited his vowels, top of his lungs at first, then weak as a\
  \ squeaky hinge.</p> \n    <p>\"Drop it.\" When he didn't, I shook the tree.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The sword hit the ground. Three of the purses followed.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  All of them.\" I squeezed.</p> \n    <p>Fingers shaking, he slipped out a platinum\
  \ coin and tucked it behind his sash before letting the purse fall to the ground.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>I collected the money while he cradled his peaches. When I reached for\
  \ his sash, he tucked an elbow over the coin. I cracked him across the face and\
  \ took the coin. It was different from the local currency I'd seen. \"What's this?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"A token,\" he wheezed. \"Sentimental value. Please... let me keep\
  \ it.\"</p> \n    <p>Instead of the head of a queen or a bishop, stamped on the\
  \ face of the coin was a woman performing what the boss would call \"an unmentionable\
  \ act.\"</p> \n    <p>For a couple seconds I considered what to do with these lousy\
  \ killers. Cutting their throats would be a big favor to the neighbors. But I really\
  \ was sick of killing.</p> \n    <p>I flipped the coin, slapped it flat on the back\
  \ of my hand, pretended to make a choice. \"Desna smiles on you boys tonight.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>I sauntered away until I turned the corner. Then I ran.</p> \n   \
  \ <p align=\"center\">∗∗∗</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Lolanda.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Lolanda_360.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n     <br> Who could say no to a face like Iolanda's?\n    </div> \n  \
  \  <p>According to the fourth guy I asked, the brothel that minted the coin was\
  \ way across town. Between the boss's purse and the loot I took from the cutthroats,\
  \ there was no reason to walk. I flagged down a carriage. Settling into the cab,\
  \ I couldn't stop looking at the coin, rolling it across my knuckles. It'd been\
  \ a long, long time since anyone'd done something that kind of unmentionable to\
  \ me.</p> \n    <p>At the brothel, I tossed the driver the smallest of the stolen\
  \ purses. He took a peek inside and whistled his appreciation. \"Shall I wait for\
  \ you, sir?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Nah, I'm going to take my time.\"</p> \n    <p>He tipped\
  \ his hat as I jumped out.</p> \n    <p>The bouncers took one look at me and started\
  \ pushing up their sleeves. I didn't want any more trouble. One of the bouncers\
  \ was a half-orc with tusks bigger than my spurs.</p> \n    <p>\"Take it easy, fellas,\"\
  \ I said. \"I got this coin.\"</p> \n    <p>They squinted at the token, grumbled\
  \ a bit, and nodded at the halfling doorman. As I went inside, the slip whispered,\
  \ \"Nice jacket.\"</p> \n    <p>I never get tired of hearing that. Some fellas spend\
  \ all their money on booze or shiver. Me, I like to look sharp. I tipped the slip\
  \ a gold coin, which didn't seem to impress him much. Once I got inside, I saw why.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The boss, he's probably the richest guy in Egorian, capital of Cheliax,\
  \ which is pretty much the richest country in the world. That makes my boss the\
  \ richest guy in the world.</p> \n    <p>Well, maybe that's not what he'd call \"\
  empirically true.\" But let's just say that the difference between my boss and the\
  \ actual richest guy in the world is less than the difference between me and somebody\
  \ else who ain't rich.</p> \n    <p>The boss is better with the metaphors.</p> \n\
  \    <p>The brothel's salon made the boss's look like a warehouse office. It was\
  \ all red velvet cushions, tiger-hide couches, chandeliers like all the stars fell\
  \ down at once, carpet so thick you needed a machete to cross the room, with all\
  \ the knobs and fixtures made of gold-plated gold. And the girls...</p> \n    <p>Years\
  \ back, my old boss Zandros the Fair put me in charge of security for a couple of\
  \ the Goatherds' houses on Trick Alley. Even after he got jealous and put me back\
  \ on collections, I spent a fair amount of my free time getting to know the ladies\
  \ of the lane. Whenever one of the houses brought in a great beauty, the madam always\
  \ said the new girl was from some far-away land: Osirion, Qadira, Tian Xia, Rahadoum,\
  \ or Katapesh. Standing in this fancy brothel, I realized they'd all lied.</p> \n\
  \    <p>All those beauties came from Absalom.</p> \n    <p>The girls were made of\
  \ all the colors, hair and eyes and skin. There were elf girls with ears as slim\
  \ as milkweed, and their eyes were jewels. There were slip girls nimble as forest\
  \ nymphs, three of them chasing each other over the furniture and through the legs\
  \ of the clients. There were fat girls, skinny girls, tall girls, short girls, a\
  \ couple of bald girls, and one dwarf girl with biceps bigger than mine. I winked\
  \ at her. Later on, we were going to talk massage.</p> \n    <p>Somebody put a cool\
  \ glass in my hand. I drank it without looking. Fizzy.</p> \n    <p>\"Can I help\
  \ you find something in particular?\" A slim fellow in a white butler's coat stood\
  \ beside me. When I got a closer look, I wasn't so sure it was a fellow after all.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"I got this coin.\" I showed it.</p> \n    <p>\"Iolanda. You lucky devil.\"\
  \ His or her wink smoothed over my suspicion that it was a crack about my bloodline.\
  \ Lots of folks mistake the grip of the big knife hanging from the spine of my jacket\
  \ for a tail, which I don't have—and no horns neither, so don't even start. Not-a-butler\
  \ pointed up a spiral staircase to indicate a balcony on the third floor. \"Up there.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>I tossed away the glass and started up the stairs.</p> \n    <p>From\
  \ some angles the hair she let spill over the balcony was black as ink. From others,\
  \ blue as midnight. </p> \n    <p>People got in my way, but I pushed them aside\
  \ without a glance. I couldn't look away from Iolanda.</p> \n    <p>It was her eyes.\
  \ They weren't blue, not if sapphires are blue. Not purple either, if that's what\
  \ you call amethysts. They were the color of those stars you think you see some\
  \ nights, only when you point them out to someone else, they're already gone, dark\
  \ as the blank sky. But you never forget them.</p> \n    <p>Iolanda didn't look\
  \ at me, even after I got close. I tried to follow her gaze, but she wasn't looking\
  \ at anybody downstairs, although plenty of them were staring up at her. She sighed\
  \ through lips like ripe plums.</p> \n    <p>On the way up, I'd worked out a few\
  \ ice-breaking lines, real charming stuff. When the moment came, I cracked the little\
  \ smile and said, \"I got this coin.\"</p> \n    <p>She looked down at me. She didn't\
  \ quite sniff, but her expression told me she was used to seeing a higher class\
  \ of client. Still, she took the coin. Her fingernails were painted the exact same\
  \ shade as her lips. Somebody's got that job, I thought, staring at her lips while\
  \ mixing that color. Desna smiles on that guy.</p> \n    <p>\"Come.\" She led me\
  \ to a bedroom door. \"This won't take long.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Don't be so quick\
  \ to judge.\" On the other hand, I thought, I'd been what you call abstinent for\
  \ over a year. \"Let's take our time. I got all night.\"</p> \n    <p>She stopped\
  \ and turned toward me, her voice serious. \"You understand what these tokens indicate.\
  \ You receive only the favor shown.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Yeah, I know. I just figured...\"\
  \ I shrugged, hopeful.</p> \n    <p>\"Only what is shown, and only for as long as\
  \ it takes.\" She gave me a closer look. Her eyes trailed across my jacket. She\
  \ frowned like she was thinking. I wanted to make her smile.</p> \n    <p>\"How\
  \ much for the night? I got money.\"</p> \n    <p>She named her price. The only\
  \ guy I knew who could pay it was the boss, and he'd need more guys to carry that\
  \ purse.</p> \n    <p>She saw it on my face and raised an eyebrow. \"Perhaps there\
  \ is something else you can do for me. Something that would be worth more of my\
  \ attention.\" She trailed a finger along the dragon on my left shoulder. Even through\
  \ the leather, her touch gave me a thrill.</p> \n    <p>\"What do you want, sweetheart?\
  \ Just name it.\"</p> \n    <p>She smiled. </p> \n    <p>\"A killing.\"</p> \n \
