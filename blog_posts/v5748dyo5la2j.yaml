  \ Iconics: Lem</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, January 22, 2008 </p> \n   <div\
  \ itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p> Although Lem was raised in the lap of luxury,\
  \ his childhood was anything but comfortable. He had the unfortunate luck to be\
  \ born into slavery, to a mother indentured to one of Cheliax's countless noble\
  \ families. Lem was sold a half dozen times to different nobles before he reached\
  \ the age of two. Such is the fate of most of Cheliax's halflings (often called\
  \ \"slips\" by that nation's citizens). Halflings are much valued as slaves in Cheliax\
  \ since they take up less room and since their inborn optimism ironically stunts\
  \ escape urges. Halflings born into slavery in Cheliax are prone to think of their\
  \ lot in life as \"lucky.\" They are fond of saying, \"At least we aren't living\
  \ in the gutter or starving!\"</p> \n    <p>Nevertheless, halflings who rankle at\
  \ the concept of enslavement do appear. Halflings like Lem. Growing up a slave in\
  \ the devil-haunted empire of Cheliax exposed Lem to a shocking range of decadence\
  \ and debauchery. He learned from a young age how to say what his superiors wanted\
  \ to hear, and as he grew older, these skills often secured him less onerous jobs.\
  \ While his kin toiled in basement washrooms or tended hellhound stables, Lem was\
  \ taught to play the flute so he could entertain at family gatherings. Yet Lem was\
  \ not blind to the discomfort of his brothers and sisters, and when he learned that\
  \ a dozen of his kin were to be sacrificed to a devil as an offering to seal a new\
  \ trade contract, Lem knew the time to act had come. Taking advantage of his increased\
  \ mobility in the manor, it was a relatively simple trick to light a few fires in\
  \ secret corners and then ensure that all of his halfling kin were safe in the slave's\
  \ quarters. The manor burnt quickly, but Lem was shocked to see his kin rush back\
  \ to the manor in a hopeless attempt to aid in extinguishing the flames. As the\
  \ place burnt to the ground, and the halflings bemoaned their fate and the loss\
  \ of their shelter, Lem slipped away into the night, bitter and distraught over\
  \ this unexpected turn of events.</p> \n    <p>Lem left Cheliax by stowing away\
  \ on a merchant vessel and never looked back. He rarely speaks of his childhood\
  \ today, but one can see its effects in his high disdain for law and order, and\
  \ his intolerance for cruelty. Always quick to side with the underdog, Lem has learned\
  \ that his most powerful traits are his optimism and sense of humor—virtues that\
  \ almost make up for his small stature and impulsive nature. Lem's reasons for traveling\
  \ with his current companions vary upon the day and his mood, but he certainly values\
  \ their strengths—and the never-ending supply of comedy material their antics provide\
  \ him.</p> \n    <p>Lem debuts as a pregenerated character in <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7zdb\"\
  >volume 7</a> of <i><a href=\"/pathfinder\">Pathfinder</a></i> and in GameMastery\
  \ Module <i>W2: <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7zdk\">River Into Darkness</a></i>. </p>\n\
