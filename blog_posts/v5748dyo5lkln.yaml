  >As part of our announcement for Pathfinder Second Edition, we recorded a game session\
  \ with the hilarious crew from the <a href=\"https://glasscannonpodcast.com/\" target=\"\
  _blank\">Glass Cannon Network</a>. They were kind enough to invite us to their studio\
  \ in New York, where Erik Mona and I playtested the game with them, converting the\
  \ first ever Pathfinder Module, <a href=\"/products/btpy89c9?Pathfinder-Module-Crypt-of-the-Everflame\"\
  ><em>Crypt of the Everflame</em></a>, to the new rules.</p> \n    <p>Because this\
  \ was a live session, and because I was converting this adventure \"on the fly,\"\
  \ I thought it might be useful to all the listeners out there to include a companion\
  \ blog post that explores some of the spoilers from the recording and corrects a\
  \ few of the mistakes that we made during play.</p> \n    <p>Note that the following\
  \ commentary includes spoilers, so if you have not listened to the podcast, you\
  \ should probably go and download it from the Glass Cannon Network site right now\
  \ (or from wherever you subscribe to podcasts). Entries include an approximate time\
  \ stamp to let you know at what point they happen during the session.</p> \n   \

  \ \n    <h2>Commentary for Part 1</h2> \n    <p>This commentary refers to the first\
  \ part of the podcast.</p> \n    <ul>\n     <li>(03:00) I should note that the new\
  \ version of Pathfinder has been in design now for well over two years. The first\
  \ playtest of the core mechanics was only a few months into the design process,\
  \ back in 2016.</li> \n     <li><b>(04:00)</b> Obligatory Princess Bride reference.</li>\
  \ \n     <li><b>(04:40)</b> The only preparation for this adventure was to pull\
  \ together existing monster statistics that correspond to those in the adventure.\
  \ So, if the adventure featured wolves, the document I had with me had the new wolf\
  \ stat block. Nothing else was converted—not the traps, random skill challenges,\
  \ or monsters—without a corresponding converted stat block.</li> \n     <li><b>(06:00)</b>\
  \ This is the actual beginning of the module, starting with player and character\
  \ introductions and the reveal of the adventure they are about to undertake. For\
  \ ease of reference, the players and their characters listed here: \n      <blockquote>\n\
  \       <p><b><i>Pherise (Matthew Capodicasa)</i></b>, Elf Rogue<br> <b><i>Mamolo\
  \ Blunch (Skid Maher)</i></b>, Goblin Alchemist<br> <b><i>Keith Slashmaster (Troy\
  \ Lavallee)</i></b>, Human Fighter<br> <b><i>Grellun the Green (Erik Mona)</i></b>,\
  \ Human Wizard,<br> <b><i>Emmerich Kant (Joe O'Brien)</i></b>, Human Paladin<br>\
  \ <b><i>Sifferus Sufferas the Vociferous (Grant Berger)</i></b>, Human Cleric</p>\n\
  \      </blockquote></li> \n     <li><b>(31:40)</b> The first skill check in the\
  \ game is a Society check. This skill covers knowledge about towns, people, their\
  \ customs, and their history. The information they are looking for here is relatively\
  \ common knowledge, and the number they needed to roll (the Difficulty Class) is\
  \ only a 10. Keith (Troy) fumbled the check and got false information, which was\
  \ quickly debunked by the others.</li> \n     <li><b>(35:30)</b> The party leaves\
  \ town, entering exploration mode as they venture into the Fangwood.</li> \n   \
  \  <li><b>(39:00)</b> Erik, playing Grellun, just starts reading the spell descriptions\
  \ from his character folio. Of note, when he reads off <i>acid splash</i>, he mentions\
  \ \"somatic\" and \"verbal,\" which does not seem to be much of a spoiler, but those\
  \ are actually the names of the two actions you must spend to cast the spell!</li>\
  \ \n     <li><b>(39:50)</b> To keep the adventure moving along, in the hope to make\
  \ this only a few hours long in total, there are a number of minor encounters that\
  \ get skipped. During the journey, for example, I left out the encounter with the\
  \ wolves, as it is ultimately unnecessary to the overall plot. Of course, the game\
  \ still ran extremely long, due in large part to the fact that we were just having\
  \ too much fun.</li> \n     <li><b>(40:10)</b> Here we have the first fight of the\
  \ game, against a trio of bloodthirsty orcs. </li> \n     <li><b>(43:50)</b> That's\
  \ right, Perception is no longer a skill. Your class gives you an initial proficiency\
  \ in Perception and might possibly increase it over time.</li> \n     <li><b>(47:30)</b>\
  \ A note on attacking more than once in a round. If he had attacked with all three\
  \ of his actions, the third attack would have been at an even larger penalty.</li>\
  \ \n     <li><b>(54:10)</b> Most of the maneuvers—grabbing, disarming, tumbling,\
  \ and tripping—are now associated with the Acrobatics or Athletics skills.</li>\
  \ \n     <li><b>(59:00)</b> As the fight rages on, it quickly becomes apparent to\
  \ some of the characters that these orcs are not real. Created by illusion magic,\
  \ they vanish the moment they are struck. These phantom foes are created using a\
  \ new spell called illusory creature. Created by a hidden wizard, these orcs are\
  \ bit more difficult to hit than ordinary foes, basing their statistics on the caster.\
  \ The fact that they are a spell also explains why they have only two actions each\
  \ turn and hit for so little damage (all of which is halved once the illusion is\
  \ revealed).</li> \n     <li><b>(1:05:30)</b> The developers made me change that\
  \ back. Neon green dice once again roll just as well as any other color of dice.</li>\
  \ \n     <li><b>(1:07:20)</b> Nimble Dodge has seen a lot of play in office playtests\
  \ and has saved the lives of countless rogues.</li> \n     <li><b>(1:11:40)</b>\
  \ The characters in this playtest have decent bonuses to attack, but that is of\
  \ little help when everyone is rolling lower than 10. No amount of redesign can\
  \ account for fickle dice.</li> \n     <li><b>(1:16:00)</b> A note on flanking.\
  \ I made a small error here. Flanking does not grant you a +2 bonus to hit. Instead,\
  \ it now makes the target flat-footed to your attacks, causing it to take a –2 penalty\
  \ to its AC. It's the same result, but the distinction is relevant.</li>\n    </ul>\
  \ \n    <h2>Commentary for Part 2</h2> \n    <ul>\n     <li><b>(02:30)</b> I call\
  \ that a skill unlock, which is an old term for what we now call a skill feat, which\
  \ characters get starting at 2nd level.</li> \n     <li><b>(05:00)</b> Small mistake\
  \ here. The three-action casting of <i>heal</i> does indeed target everyone in the\
  \ group, but it heals only an amount equal to the caster's spellcasting ability\
  \ modifier at this level (which should be only 4).</li> \n     <li><b>(07:10)</b>\
  \ I probably should have waited until he rolled to announce the result.</li> \n\
  \     <li><b>(11:10)</b> The Survival skill can be used to navigate in the wild,\
  \ make a shelter, and find food. In this case, instead of making shelter, the skill\
  \ was used to simply find a good, defensible place to camp.</li> \n     <li><b>(14:10)</b>\
  \ Remnants of the wolf encounter that I decided to skip to keep things moving.</li>\
  \ \n     <li><b>(19:00)</b> Okay, I admit, my description of the body may have been\
  \ a bit too detailed, but it is important for the tone shift that happens at this\
  \ point in the adventure. Things are starting to get serious.</li> \n     <li><b>(21:10)</b>\
  \ This really does begin to show the relationship between proficiencies and crafting\
  \ that will undoubtedly be the topic of a future blog post. Suffice it to say, the\
  \ higher your proficiency, the higher the quality of the items that you can craft.</li>\
  \ \n     <li><b>(23:50)</b> For clarity, there is a pair of puncture wounds on the\
  \ upper torso and another on the lower torso. The punctures are about an inch in\
  \ diameter, with the pair about 12 inches apart. </li> \n     <li><b>(24:20)</b>\
  \ The only way the illusion is detected is if it is lower-level than the detection\
  \ spell. If it is of the same level, it is unnoticed.</li> \n     <li><b>(36:10)</b>\
  \ In converting this particular hazard, I treated the various results on the table\
  \ as the failure, critical failure, success, and critical success results of the\
  \ new effect. The DC was changed to 15. I modified the damage a little, but the\
  \ only other significant change was to remove the ability damage from the critical\
  \ failure effect, replacing it with a condition to represent a sprained ankle.</li>\
  \ \n     <li><b>(46:10)</b> If this were during combat, when time was short, I could\
  \ have called for an Athletics skill check to move the horse carcass, instead of\
  \ just looking at their Strength scores and figuring out how much spare bulk they\
  \ had to move it around.</li> \n     <li><b>(51:50)</b> Repeated the mistake here\
  \ with <i>heal</i> again. It should have been only 4 points restored.</li> \n  \
  \   <li><b>(55:10)</b> The skeletons here are not very powerful undead, but in large\
  \ numbers like this, they can be deadly. Most problematic, they have resistance\
  \ 5 to weapon damage, but they still have a weakness to bludgeoning, which can cancel\
  \ out that protection.</li> \n     <li><b>(1:01:20)</b> Skeletons also have resistance\
  \ 5 against fire damage.</li> \n     <li><b>(1:05:25)</b> Claws are agile weapons,\
  \ which is why the skeletons use them as their second attack, reducing the penalty\
  \ on the attack roll to –4.</li> \n     <li><b>(1:09:00)</b> The Shield Block reaction\
  \ is very powerful, preventing damage by forcing the foe to beat its way through\
  \ your protection. It does mean that warriors tend to go through shields with some\
  \ frequency.</li> \n     <li><b>(1:11:00)</b> The shield spell is also a cantrip,\
  \ meaning that you can cast it as often as you like.</li> \n     <li><b>(1:13:30)</b>\
  \ Explaining the confusion, there was an earlier draft of <i>acid splash</i> that\
  \ hit multiple targets. That is no longer the case.</li> \n     <li><b>(1:16:10)</b>\
  \ Troy just cannot roll above a 5 in this fight.</li> \n     <li><b>(1:19:00)</b>\
  \ I finally realized that I was doing the heal spell wrong, and then promptly missed\
  \ the part where the skeletons should get a save against the effect. Fortunately,\
  \ it didn't matter much; they were all pretty damaged at this point.</li> \n   \
  \  <li><b>(1:21:45)</b> Sweeping the leg is probably an Athletics skill check...</li>\
  \ \n     <li><b>(1:24:50)</b> There are two doors leading out of the room: one to\
  \ the east, one to the west. The scream came from the west. Somewhere in the dungeon,\
  \ a tortured soul calls out for help.</li>\n    </ul> \n    <p>That wraps up this\
  \ look at the first part of the playtest podcast with the Glass Cannon Network.\
  \ Stop by on Monday when we will be investigating how you level up using the new\
  \ rules!</p> \n    <p>Jason Bulmahn<br> <i>Director of Game Design</i></p> \n  \
