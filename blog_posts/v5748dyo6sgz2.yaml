  \    </div> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">One never needs\
  \ look far from the loveliest flower to find the worms fatting on the buried dead\
  \ below, providing for beauty’s banquet above. Such truths are known to the gods.\
  \ There can be no light without darkness, no life without death, no good without\
  \ evil. As one of the First among the gods, these truths are held as virtues to\
  \ glorious Desna, Song of the Spheres. She knows and teaches that a thing of beauty\
  \ to your eye may be a wretched affront to mine. Beauty and horror can exist simultaneously.\
  \ Beauty and horror can be the same.</p> \n     <p>But do not let any deceive you\
  \ that beauty and horror are equals. One need not endure the pain of rent flesh\
  \ to marvel at the glitter of a finely-honed blade, nor should you be forced to\
  \ endure the ache of loneliness just to enjoy the peace of solitude. Learn, Desna\
  \ teaches us, that enjoyment and delight in the pleasures of life is not a sin.\
  \ You need not pay for bliss with shame, and you should not fear the horror that\
  \ lies within all beauty.</p> \n     <p>For so Desna learned herself when she woke\
  \ the abominable Gossamer King from his shrouded dreams.</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  \ Dal Lago</p> \n     </div> \n     <p>In those earliest of days, long before the\
  \ first of us dreamed our mortal dreams, the gods were still young and they still\
  \ had much to learn. The worlds of worlds had yet to hang in the firmament, and\
  \ the First of those Worlds was still being woven as Desna drifted, dreaming and\
  \ delighting, through the In-Between.</p> \n     <p>In that time, the Ethereal Plane\
  \ was no Ghost World, for no lives had yet been lost to mortal souls. Nor was it\
  \ a Space Between Spaces, for the worlds of reality had yet to be forged. It was\
  \ first, and yet remains, the In-Between. A place not fully dreaming, yet neither\
  \ fully awake. Such sights Desna beheld In-Between tugged at her heart and would\
  \ inspire her in time to light Cynosure itself at the heart of the Cosmic Caravan.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>And so when, in her rapturous wanderings, the Song of the Spheres came\
  \ across a glistening shape drifting alone, she became entranced. Here was a splendid\
  \ ovoid of shimmering silken strands, each twined length sliding and singing against\
  \ its kin and bright with more colors than any mortal eye would ever behold. Desna\
  \ could see that the shape was a shroud of woven lengths, yet the strings had no\
  \ beginning and no end, as if it had simply formed at once as a single impossibly\
  \ tangled length.</p> \n     <p>Desna was not content to simply look upon the shape,\
  \ and so she settled upon it. It was warm to the touch, and its smooth surface compelled\
  \ the hand to slide along its pleasing textures. And as she held the shape, she\
  \ knew it was but a covering, a shroud that held an even greater wonder within.\
  \ What mysterious marvel lay shielded from view by those few thin layers of silk?\
  \ What unbeheld revelation waited within this strange traveler through the flickering\
  \ void? Desna knew of the brutality of evil and the rancor of wrath, for such awfulness\
  \ has existed from the beginning. She knew, even as she tugged at the strands and\
  \ worried at the weave, that something this entrancing could also be something equally\
  \ awful, yet she paid those nagging thoughts no mind.</p> \n     <p>She opened the\
  \ Gossamer King’s cocoon, and as Ghlaunder emerged, Desna knew sorrow and regret\
  \ for the first time.</p> \n     <p>Ghlaunder crawled from quiescence: eyes and\
  \ mouths—eyes that were mouths; legs and tongues—legs that were tongues; hunger\
  \ and hate—hunger that was hate. Ghlauder seized upon the Song of the Spheres. She\
  \ brushed aside those starving stalks and slashing teeth, yet more were there to\
  \ vex voraciously, for Ghlaunder had waited for eons, and in eons, hunger has much\
  \ time to compel. As Ghlaunder fed in desperate gulps, as it glutted upon Desna’\
  s divine grace, its wings unfurled and there Desna beheld glory again. For the Gossamer\
  \ King’s iridescent wings held the same shimmering beauty that had caught Desna’\
  s eye before his wakening.</p> \n     <p>Desna could not bring herself to destroy\
  \ Ghlaunder, yet she knew he was a great hunger whose presence would bring pain\
  \ and suffering. And so Desna drew upon her might and banished Ghlaunder from the\
  \ In-Between, and the Gossamer King was hurled from the Inner Sphere to fester far\
  \ beyond within the Outer Rifts, a place more accepting of his countenance now that\
  \ his shroud had been forever torn.</p> \n     <p>Desna left the In-Between soon\
  \ after, and in the creation of the worlds of worlds, she would find much more to\
  \ remind her of the beauty of reality, yet always the Gossamer King’s lesson remained.\
  \ Even in great beauty could dwell great horror—and in great horror one might find\
  \ great beauty.</p> \n     <p>The Gossamer King lives still. His faithful infest\
  \ the neglected cracks of society, and they see the face of god in the rasping kiss\
  \ of the chewing maggot or the thirsty work of the supping leech. Yet do not doctors\
  \ use maggots to save the living from gangrenous wounds? Have not physicians used\
  \ leeches to reduce the swelling of inflamed flesh?</p> \n     <p>Desna’s faithful\
  \ are not alone in the constant fight against the cults of those like the Gossamer\
  \ King, but Desna today is the first to point to her mistake of releasing this evil\
  \ into reality not as something to be ashamed of. It was a chance to learn. It is\
  \ always better to live, to make mistakes, and accept the challenges discovered\
  \ as opportunities to grow, to teach, and to do better than to suppress and forget.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>And while the sight of a devotee of Ghlaunder clad in the faith’s most\
  \ sacred raiment—a thousand thousand sucking mosquitos worn together as robes—certainly\
  \ turns the stomach, is there not something of beauty in how each of those gossamer\
  \ wings shines back the twinkling starlight from the night skies above?</p> \n \

  \    <p>James Jacobs is the Creative Director for Pathfinder. While he was there\
  \ at the beginning of Golarion’s creation, many of the deities worshiped by that\
  \ world’s heroes and villains had already existed for decades before. Goddesses\
  \ and gods like Desna and Rovagug, Sarenrae and Abadar, Achaekek and Zon-Kuthon\
  \ first established their faithful among PCs and NPCs alike in James’ home campaign\
  \ in the late 80s and early 90s. Sharing them with the world as deities of the Pathfinder\
  \ setting, seeing players and creators come to love and hate them (and in some cases\
  \ cosplay as them), has been a career highlight.</p> \n     <p style=\"font-weight:\
  \ bold; line-height: 14px\">About the Windsong Testaments</p> \n     <p>On the northern\
  \ reaches of Varisia’s Lost Coast stands Windsong Abbey, a forum for interfaith\
  \ discussion tended by priests of nearly twenty faiths and led by a legacy of Masked\
  \ Abbesses. At the dawn of the Age of Lost Omens, Windsong Abbey suffered as its\
  \ faithful fought and fled, but today it has begun to recover. A new Masked Abbess\
  \ guides a new flock within, and the <i>Windsong Testaments</i>—parables about the\
  \ gods themselves—are once again being recorded within the abbey’s walls. Some of\
  \ these Testaments are presented here as Golarion’s myths and fables. Some parts\
  \ may be true. Other parts are certainly false. Which ones are which is left to\
  \ the faithful to decide.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n   </div> <!-- tags:  The Windsong\
