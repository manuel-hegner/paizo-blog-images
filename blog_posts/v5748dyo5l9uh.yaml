  \ \n    <p class=\"date\">Wednesday, March 4, 2009</p> \n    <p>\"Forget the dwarf!\
  \ Tumble past the bad guys, get the bird, and let's get the heck out of here!\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Things were not going well for us. David started calling these playtesting\
  \ sessions \"The Misadventures of Erebus.\" But still, it was fun. The interesting\
  \ thing about this playtest was all of the planning and options involved. For this\
  \ encounter, we had to choose from a number of stratagems. After finally deciding\
  \ upon one, we launched into action. I again cast <i>entangle</i> (Sean has taken\
  \ to calling my druid \"The Entangler\"), summoned an owl, cast <i>magic fang</i>\
  \ on my eagle, then sent the two avian avengers to flank one of the baddies. We\
  \ were also using some new rules of Jason's for animal companions, and because of\
  \ a typo my eagle and summoned ally got severely nerfed. The actual rules are nicely\
  \ balanced, but my tactic ended up being of little help because of the misunderstanding,\
  \ and Sean quickly (and gleefully, I might add) turned them into feathery pi√±atas.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>After my eagle, Beaky, and our dwarf fighter dropped, and my summoned\
  \ ally vanished, I called out the line of the night to David, who refused to either\
  \ run away or pick up my eagle. I warned him, though, that if he dropped too, I\
  \ was only picking up my animal companion. Well, to make a long story short, we're\
  \ going to be refighting this battle next session. ;)</p> \n    <p>So we continued\
  \ with the story, and we were soon presented with more stratagem planning. I really\
  \ like this about the adventure. So far with the 3 parts we have played through,\
  \ there have always been a number of choices, each with its own interesting tactical\
  \ advantages and disadvantages. This always ends up with a lot of debating, but\
  \ I've long been a fan of this sort of thing because it keeps the players engaged.\
  \ Of course, we always have the standard rush-forward-and-kick-down-the-door option,\
  \ but unlike many modules out there, this isn't funneling us down a path where our\
  \ only real options are which door we want to open next.</p> \n    <p> We had just\
  \ settled upon our tactic for the third part of the adventure when Sean called it\
  \ a night. Now we have to wait another week before we get to see if our carefully\
  \ laid plans will lead to glorious victory or to humiliating defeat... May Shelyn\
  \ protect us!</p> \n    <p>Hank Woon <br>Editorial Intern</p> \n   </blockquote>\
