  \  <p class=\"date\">Friday, July 29, 2011</p> \n    <p>I attended my first gaming\
  \ convention in 1995. Home for a summer between college semesters and with my regular\
  \ high-school D&amp;D game done and buried thanks to all of the players attending\
  \ school in different states, I was aching to throw some dice, kill some monsters,\
  \ and take their stuff. So I headed over to the Thunderbird Hotel in Bloomington,\
  \ Minnesota and entered a whole new world of public gaming.</p> \n    <p>At Twin\
  \ Con I played my first session of Living City, the original shared-world RPG campaign,\
  \ and met a lot of local gamers who shared my gaming interests. I won a contest\
  \ for a unique dagger designed by a local artisan, with LC stats to boot, and played\
  \ a ripping game of Circus Imperium (\"Whip the beast! Whip the beast!\"). Most\
  \ importantly, I picked up a sign-up form for Gen Con, and within a week of Twin\
  \ Con I was registered for the biggest and best American gaming convention of them\
  \ all.</p> \n    <p>I'd long wanted to attend this gaming Mecca (then held, naturally,\
  \ at Milwaukee's MECCA Convention Center) thanks to previews and coverage in <i>Dragon\
  \ Magazine</i> and <i>Polyhedron</i>, the official newszine of the RPGA Network\
  \ that brought me the Living City campaign I'd so enjoyed at Twin Con. I knew that\
  \ all the big gaming companies timed their major releases for the show, and that\
  \ it attracted tens of thousands of \"alpha gamers\" from all over the world to\
  \ play all sorts of games, shop in the cavernous exhibit hall, and learn from game\
  \ professionals in panels and seminars. But until 1995, I'd never managed to have\
  \ the right combination of time, money, and transportation to make my dream of hitting\
  \ Gen Con a reality.</p> \n    <p>Flush with exciting stories of my fun time at\
  \ Twin Con, I managed to convince a small gaggle of my local gamer buddies to accompany\
  \ me on the road trip to Milwaukee. I recruited these guys from my old high-school-era\
  \ gaming circles, and while none of them were as rabid as I was about gaming, they\
  \ agreed to come with me and help split the cost of the hotel room.</p> \n    <p>That\
  \ first Gen Con was a marvel. Until you've been to the show you can't really imagine\
  \ how impressive it is to see 30,000+ gamers take over the downtown core of a major\
  \ city. You have no idea what it's like to stand in an enormous dealer room filled\
  \ with just about every gaming company you can think of, with booths staffed by\
  \ some of the same names you usually see on book covers. It was an amazing experience,\
  \ and one I swore almost instantly to repeat on an annual basis.</p> \n   </blockquote>\

  \   </table> \n   <blockquote> \n    <p>For whatever reason, though, my buddies\
  \ were not quite so enthusiastic, and so when the time came to sign up for Gen Con\
  \ 1996, I couldn't convince any of my old gaming friends to come with me. Slowly\
  \ but surely, by attending several local Living City events, I was developing a\
  \ new cadre of gaming buddies, but only a year after I first got involved with LC,\
  \ none of those relationships had gelled to the point where I felt comfortable sharing\
  \ a hotel room with those guys. So I did the unthinkable, and decided to head out\
  \ to Gen Con all by myself.</p> \n    <p>Even though it was my second Gen Con, 1996\
  \ feels like my first when I think back on it, because I felt like such a fish out\
  \ of water that year. Without the companionship of pals to take in the convention\
  \ with me, I ended up setting my own schedule and doing the things that I wanted\
  \ to do, exclusively. And around then that meant haunting the various TSR seminars\
  \ (especially when they had to do with my beloved World of Greyhawk campaign setting),\
  \ playing a ton of RPGA events, and scouring the dealer hall for out-of-print AD&amp;D\
  \ modules I'd somehow missed the first time around. It was enormously fun, but I\
  \ went into it quite nervous. It's hard to feel lonely among 30,000 fellow gamers,\
  \ but with no hotel roommates and no friends to share the experience, I was worried\
  \ that I wouldn't have any fun at all. I felt more like an isolated newbie than\
  \ I ever had that first year.</p> \n    <p>I needn't have worried. I was far, far\
  \ too busy to ever feel lonely. Within the first day I'd met up with the local RPGA'ers,\
  \ and the convention's relentless programming had me seated at game tables around\
  \ the clock. A funny thing happened at those game tables. I started recognizing\
  \ gamers from the previous year, and they started recognizing me. The next year,\
  \ 1997, I split a room in the vaunted (and, let's face it, probably haunted) Hotel\
  \ Wisconsin with 11 other RPGA fanatics, some from my native Minneapolis and some\
  \ from all over the country. I began to travel with these new friends, hitting game\
  \ days and cons in Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, and even Florida. Far from being\
  \ alone, as I'd feared the previous year, I was developing a huge network of hard-core\
  \ gaming buddies all over the country.</p> \n   </blockquote> \n   <table align=\"\

  \   </table> \n   <blockquote> \n    <p>At Gen Cons between 1996 and 1998, my questions\
  \ at various TSR seminars (along with, I must admit, a ton of critical commentary\
  \ on the old TSR area on America Online) brought me to the attention of a few D&amp;D\
  \ contributors, who soon hired me on as a freelance continuity consultant for Greyhawk\
  \ and Planescape projects. That work brought me to the attention of Wizards of the\
  \ Coast's Lisa Stevens, who hired me for real in 1999 to join the RPGA staff as\
  \ editor of <i>Polyhedron</i> and the head honcho of the network's Living Greyhawk\
  \ campaign, which was to coincide with the launch of third edition Dungeons &amp;\
  \ Dragons in 2000.</p> \n    <p>Gen Con 1999, my fifth consecutive appearance, was\
  \ the first time I attended the show as a gaming professional. The following year\
  \ I launched Living Greyhawk and helped manage the RPGA's presence at the show,\
  \ which dominated a massive arena complete with stadium seating and poorly lit subterranean\
  \ passages. A lot of the volunteer coordinators of the Living Greyhawk campaign\
  \ turned out to be guys I'd played RPGA games with those first couple of years,\
  \ solidifying friendships with gamers who had been strangers only a few short years\
  \ before.</p> \n    <p>By 2002, I'd been transferred from the RPGA to the periodicals\
  \ division of Wizards of the Coast, which was spun off to form Paizo Publishing.\
  \ This gave me a whole new Gen Con experienceâ€”helping to run a dealer hall booth\
  \ for what amounted to a tiny, start-up company. \"Booth\" is probably too bold\
  \ a word, as the first Paizo booth was really just a small table with a few posters\
  \ taped to the wall of the D&amp;D castle mega-booth.</p> \n   </blockquote> \n\

  \ been one of the few constants of Paizo's presence at Gen Con. Most of the original\
  \ Paizonians have moved on to other career opportunities, but I'm still around,\
  \ standing behind a decidedly larger booth, with a decidedly larger set of responsibilities\
  \ as publisher than I had as the lowly magazine section editor of 2002.</p> \n \
  \   <p>And here I am, about to head out for my 17th consecutive Gen Con, and my\
  \ mood couldn't be further from the trepidation of 1996, when I attended the convention\
  \ alone. Because with nearly 20 years of the convention behind me, I now understand\
  \ that a gamer can never be truly alone at Gen Con. Each annual convention is a\
  \ chance to reacquaint myself with old friends and make a ton of new ones. Where\
  \ once I worried that not a single person there knew who I was, these days I can\
  \ barely walk from my hotel to the Paizo booth in less than an hour, because I end\
  \ up running into so many old friends.</p> \n    <p>If you've never been to Gen\
  \ Con, or if this is your very first year to attend and you're a bit nervous about\
  \ what's in store, take if from me. You needn't worry. Gen Con has a way of making\
  \ gamers feel right at home, and once you've attended one time, you'll have so much\
  \ fun that your biggest concern coming out of the show will be how you're going\
  \ to manage to attend next year.</p> \n    <p>And when you do come back, swing by\
  \ the Paizo booth and say hi. I'll be there, eager to meet you.</p> \n    <p>Erik\
