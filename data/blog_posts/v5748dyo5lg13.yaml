  >fifth adventure in the <i>Rise of the Runelords Adventure Path</i></a>, we've already\
  \ saved Sandpoint (again), discovered and solved some disturbing problems with a\
  \ variety of giants (hill, stone, -kin, undead, etc), cornered and defeated a pair\
  \ of lamia cleric twins what seemed like a dozen times, and met the stone giant\
  \ necromancer Mokmurian (and hopefully taken his club)! Looking around the ancient\
  \ library lair, you find important-looking references to a lost storehouse of Thassilonian\
  \ magic known as the Runeforge.</span></p> \n     <p>Meanwhile, back in Sandpoint,\
  \ a mysterious sinkhole has opened up a new area of the ruins underneath the unassuming\
  \ coastal town. Suspiciously close to the area where you found your \"old friend\"\
  \ Tsuto Kaijitsu delving for trouble back in the first adventure, we finds signs\
  \ of recent activity, along with a pack of nasty braying beasts befitting the moniker\
  \ of the Mother of Monsters. You're sure to hear their maddening howls before you\
  \ see the Hounds of Lamashtu, but even if you strike one down, you'll still need\
  \ luck or mettle—or both—to close the location.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ border=\"0\"></a> \n      <br>Bad Doggy!\n     </div> \n     <p>These hounds don't\
  \ have a keeper, but that doesn't mean that they're on their own. Caught between\
  \ the Thassilonian masters of Wrath and Greed, the thaumaturge once known as Xaliasa\
  \ fled the consequences of his treachery and swore eternal devotion to Lamashtu.\
  \ With the resurgence of the runewells, the Mistress of Insanity has raised her\
  \ late cleric and bound him to the runewell. But Xaliasa is no more—instead we find\
  \ the broken thaumaturge endlessly scribing Lamashtu's wisdom on the walls, floor,\
  \ and ceiling of his shrine, and also on the flesh of its visitors. Are you ready\
  \ to receive the wisdom of the Demon Mother?</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ border=\"0\"></a> \n      <br>Whatever shall I use for ink?\n     </div> \n  \
  \   <p>If you do manage to corner the Scribbler—a couple of times, at least, since\
  \ he keeps Word of Recall and Heal ready—you might be able to discern from his scattered\
  \ writings an ancient secret. In his former service to two different Runelords,\
  \ the Scribbler managed to discover an entrance to the Runeforge, a secret library,\
  \ laboratory, and foundry of Thassilonian magic — the same place mentioned in Mokmurian's\
  \ library at the end of Adventure 4. Here and there among the maunderings covering\
  \ the Scribbler's shrine, you piece together the location of an entrance to this\
  \ lost foundry. In a cold, remote place known as Rimeskull, you seek an ring of\
  \ ominous, carved stone monuments.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\

  \ you can harness the power of the Sihedron Circle, you'll have to master the standing\
  \ stones. Incredibly old but still bearing powerful enchantments, each stone head\
  \ much be disabled, broken, or appeased in turn. Not the simplest task anyone has\
  \ ever attempted, and probably not the safest. Your reward for success? You get\
  \ to meet Arkrhyst, the Freezemaw. Lucky you!</p> \n     <p>\n      <adventure 5\

  \    <br>Apparently, they shoot lightning. And summon dragons. Yay?\n     </div>\
  \ \n     <p>While that's quite a bit of bad news, it's not <b>all</b> bad news in\
  \ Adventure 5: Sins of the Saviors. I've showed you the first few threats, but there\
  \ are also plenty of new boons to help you out. On the combat side of things, we\
  \ have a nasty crossbow that can inflict massive damage, as long as your target\
  \ cares about things like circulation and respiration. It's good against most creatures\
  \ you might happen to trip over, and it can be downright lethal to fleshy targets\
  \ like The Scribbler.</p> \n     <p> Meanwhile, Disintegrate packs both utility\
  \ and destruction into one glowing green package. Whether you want to blast your\
  \ way through locks and walls, or dust a pesky dead, undead, or about-to-be-dead\
  \ creature, this spell is for you. It's useful in the scroll-tube of a collector\
  \ or dabbler like Merisiel or Harsk, and it can be devastating in the hands of Ezren,\
  \ Lem, or Seoni—and even if you don't manage to finish it off before it can get\
  \ to you, the beastie will trouble you no more.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  0\"></a> \n      <br>Those two don't look friendly.\n     </div> \n     <p>Shooting\
  \ and blasting are all well and good, but what about those of a more… material mindset?\
  \ Put another way, killing the bad guys and taking their stuff is good, but maybe\
  \ we can optimize away that first step? If this interests you, I have a card for\
  \ you: the unassuming but unbelievably tasty Wand of Treasure Finding. Some people\
  \ will want to use it to increase the odds of finding the key boons in a scenario,\
  \ while others will be more interested in examining the location deck. I say \"\
  Why choose, when you can have both?\"</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a\
  \ href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6005_Wand.jpg\"> <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6005_Wand_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a> \n      <br>Knowledge is power, and loot is <i>awesome</i>.\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>Finally, I have one more little helper for your adventures\
  \ into the ruins of the ancient magical empire of Thassilon. Whatever you think\
  \ of her size, shape, or various movie appearances, I assure you that she is indeed\
  \ a very clever girl. On top of all that, she's Gaby's favorite card in all of the\
  \ Rise of the Runelords: Velociraptor!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a\
  \ href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6005_Raptor.jpg\"> <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6005_Raptor_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a> \n      <br>RAAAAAAAAWWR! Velociraptor!\n     </div> \n    \
  \ <p>These are a few of the denizens and delights waiting for you as you begin Adventure\
  \ 5: Sins of the Saviors. Starting underneath the normally quiet, currently battered\
  \ town of Sandpoint, you'll end up exploring ruins of Thassilon lost almost a hundred\
  \ centuries earlier. If you're brave, clever, and lucky, you will explore the lost\
  \ halls of the Runeforge and survive—and perhaps learn how to harness rune magic\
  \ yourself, to turn it against its former masters.</p> \n     <p>I assure you, you're\
  \ going to want every advantage you can get. </p> \n     <p>Thanks for playing!</p>\
