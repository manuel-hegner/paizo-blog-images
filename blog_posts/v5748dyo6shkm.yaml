  \     <h2>New hires: </h2> \n     <p><b>Raychael Allor, Customer Service</b> (December\
  \ 21) – Hi! I’m Raychael (she/her; pronounced like ‘Rachel’, thanks mom) and I’\
  ve been playing TTRPGs regularly for about 5 years. I also spend a lot of free time\
  \ either playing CRPGs and MMOs or reading horror fiction. My Twitter handle is\
  \ @AnnonInGelydh and mostly contains retweets about mental health, cats (I have\
  \ 3), and dice (I don’t have enough). </p> \n     <p><b>Alex Crain, Warehouse Associate</b></p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>Rian Davenport, Customer Service</b></p> \n     <p><b>Addley C. Fannin,\
  \ Editor</b> – Greetings, internet. I’m Addley (they/them), a long-time gamer, forever\
  \ GM, and font of useless information. I once lived in Alaska and wrote book reviews.\
  \ Now I’m in Seattle, and couldn’t be more excited to help edit Pathfinder and Starfinder.\
  \ My Twitter doesn’t have much yet but y’all can still follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/fannin_addleyc\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">@fannin_addleyc</a></p> \n     <p><b>Heather Fantasia, Customer\
  \ Service</b> (December 28th) – Hi everyone! I wear many hats, working at Paizo\
  \ is the latest! I’m also a barista, vocal instructor, yoga enthusiast, yarn wrangler,\
  \ mom, pet mom...</p> \n     <p><b>Keith Greer, Customer Service</b> (October 2020),\
  \ (he/him) – PNW Native+For Life; I’ve been playing RPG’s (analog and digital) since\
  \ the 80s, and making dark and heavy music since the 90s; I spend my spare time\
  \ playing World of Warcraft, watching horror movies, and raising my kids (to hopefully\
  \ do the same).</p> \n     <p><b>Logan Harper, Customer Service</b> – Hi! I’m Logan\
  \ (she/her). I’m a bit of a hobbit who you can usually find curled up with my pups\
  \ watching movies. Or if it's Sunday then I’m battling monsters with The Tribe in\
  \ our online game. The rest of my downtime is spent recording voiceover auditions\
  \ and episodes for The Barking Bard Podcast with my partner. Feel free to follow\
  \ me on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LoganHarper_\" target=\"_blank\">@LoganHarper_</a></p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>Kyle Hunter, Art Director</b> (November) (he/him) – After about 15\
  \ years, I’m back! I was part of the original WotC Periodicals crew that split off\
  \ to form Paizo. Even stranger, I worked with Sarah and Sonja on Nintendo Power\
  \ in the 1990s! Wrote and drew the comic Downer in the later days of Dungeon Magazine.\
  \ In addition to designing the Paizo logo, I created the droid manufacturing logos\
  \ for Star Wars.</p> \n     <p><b>Jenny Jarzabski, Starfinder Society Developer</b>\
  \ – Hi, I’m Jenny (she/her). I’m a long-time Paizo freelancer and gamer who’s thrilled\
  \ to have officially joined the team. When I’m not playing games, I’m probably outside.\
  \ I love the great outdoors—cycling, hiking, and rock climbing are some of my favorite\
  \ activities. I sometimes ramble about various topics on Twitter, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jenjski\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">@jenjski</a>. See you in space!</p> \n     <p><b>Mike Kimmel,\
  \ Organized Play Developer</b> (January 4) – Hello! I’m Mike Kimmel (he/him), the\
  \ newest member of the Organized Play team. I’ve been a GM for 20+ years and I love\
  \ teaching people how to play games. You can witness my Twitter shenanigans at <a\
  \ href=\"https://twitter.com/_MikeKimmel\" target=\"_blank\">@_MikeKimmel</a>.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>James Mafi, Warehouse Associate</b></p> \n     <p><b>Lee Rucker,\
  \ Project Coordinator</b> – Hello! I’m Lee (they/them). When I’m not wrangling projects,\
  \ I mostly spend my time playing games (all kinds), hanging with friends (digitally\
  \ these days), and reading. I hope to utilize my skills in organizing, process improvement,\
  \ and planning to help make everyone’s lives less stressful here. </p> \n     <p><b>Levi\
  \ Steadman, Tech</b> – Hello, I’m Levi (he/him). I’m a Michigander who has been\
  \ playing Pathfinder for half his life adjusting to my new life here in the PNW.\
  \ I’ve joined the team to help with the QA process for the website and automated\
  \ some of the monotonous QA tasks that tend to slow things down. When I’m not doing\
  \ my day job or playing Pathfinder I’m almost always playing MMOs with my wife and\
  \ our friends back in Michigan.</p> \n     <h2>Title changes:</h2> \n     <p><b>James\

  \ \n     <p><b>Adam Daigle</b> (he/him): Managing Developer to <b>Director of Game\
  \ Development</b>—As I mentioned in my teary blog this past summer, when Amanda\
  \ left us for other ventures, I took over management of the Starfinder development\
  \ team in addition to the Pathfinder development team. Now I have the duty and honor\
  \ of managing the development of both of our games, and this new title represents\
  \ that. It’s weird that I was a fan and freelancer posting on our messageboards\
  \ less than ten years ago. I’ve been stoked to see so many awesome new people joining\
  \ us and seeing other people rising through the ranks to well-deserved positions.</p>\

  \ (they/them): Editor to <b>Senior Editor </b><br> After working on Pathfinder Second\
  \ Edition since the playtest, I have a huge amount of love for the system and the\

  \ and the people who inhabit it.</p> \n     <p>When I’m not editing, I enjoy learning\
  \ about nature, cross-stitching, watching horror movies, and petting my dog. I am\
  \ the company’s resident expert on bears, for which I have no certifications whatsoever.\
