  \ class=\"date\">Friday, November 30, 2007</p> \n   <p>I've mentioned before my\
  \ fondness for H. P. Lovecraft and his mythos of insane and malignant Great Old\
  \ Ones, and starting in <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy80hm\"><i>Pathfinder #4</i></a>,\
  \ the world of Golarion gets its first real taste of the Cthulhu Mythos—pictured\
  \ here is a hound of Tindalos, one of the new monsters in this volume's bestiary.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>These strange time-traveling, soul-eating monstrosities were invented\
  \ by Frank Belknap Long back in 1929 in his short story, \"The Hounds of Tindalos,\"\
  \ but they should be no strangers to those familiar with the <i>Call of Cthulhu</i>\
  \ roleplaying game published by Chaosium (itself one of the longest-lived continually-in-print\
  \ RPGs ever—check them out at <a href=\"http://www.chaosium.com\" target=\"_blank\"\
  >chaosium.com</a>). Any self-respecting gamer looking for more inspiration on the\
  \ hounds of Tindalos (or cosmic horror of any flavor) should certainly check out\
  \ <a href=\"http://paizo.com/store/brand/callOfCthulhu/roleplayingGames\">the huge\
  \ line of books and adventures</a> that have been produced for <i>Call of Cthulhu</i>\
  \ for more. The actual game stats for the hounds as they appear here are pretty\
  \ different than those from the <i>Call of Cthulhu</i> version, of course, but flavor\
  \ transcends rules. </p> \n   <p>We'll be returning to Lovecraft country later on\
  \ in Rise of the Runelords, getting a glimpse of the realm of Leng and unknown Kadath\
  \ in <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7xpw\"><i>Pathfinder #6</i></a>, and now and then\
  \ you'll be seeing other name drops occur. Yet don't expect don't expect Golarion\
  \ to fall too completely into the clutches of the Great Old Ones. When the mythos\
  \ rears its ugly head (or tentacles, or tongue, or color—whatever passes for a \"\
  head\" in each monster's case) in Golarion, they have to be justified by the adventure's\
  \ story and needs. In addition, that particular element needs to be something that\
  \ doesn't feel out of place in the sword and sorcery genre. It also needs to not\
  \ be tied to Earth. For example, Cthulhu himself is pretty much stuck in R'lyeh,\
  \ which itself is located at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean (at South Latitude\
  \ 47° 9', West Longitude 126° 43' for those of you with boats and death wishes)—\
  it doesn't make sense to have him show up on Golarion, so don't expect his wiggly\
  \ mug to pop in any time soon. Things that travel through the dimensions (like hounds\
  \ of Tindalos) or come from remote corners of the universe (which are equally as\
  \ far from Golarion as they are from Earth, really) or are from other realms entirely\
  \ (or, in the case of Leng or Kadath, are other realms) are all fair game. </p>\
