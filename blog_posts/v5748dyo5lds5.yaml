  \ (Increasingly) Old Pro</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, August 14, 2012</p>\
  \ \n   <p><span itemprop=\"description\">Hard as it is for me to imagine, this year\
  \ marks my 18th consecutive trip to Gen Con, and my 14th in a row attending as a\
  \ gaming professional. In all those years I’ve seen the convention move from Milwaukee\
  \ to Indianapolis, I’ve played hundreds of RPG sessions, and I’ve met and re-met\
  \ thousands and thousands of gamers, many of whom I now consider some of my closest\
  \ friends. As I look at my packed suitcase and contemplate another year of the world’\
  s greatest gaming convention, I thought it might be fun to take this opportunity\
  \ to list 18 Gen Con tips that will help you get the most out of the show.</span></p>\

  \  <ol>\n     <li>Stop by the Paizo booth in the exhibit hall at least once every\
  \ morning to get a different free daily Pathfinder button. We started handing out\
  \ Pathfinder buttons to folks visiting the booth about three years ago, and it’\
  s been amazing to see how popular they have become. If you’re interested in collecting\
  \ them, try to visit the booth during the first two hours the exhibit hall is open\
  \ each day. Even the staff missed out on most of last year’s buttons because they\
  \ vanished to rapidly. (PROTIP: We’ve created a special FIFTH button this year,\
  \ and the only way to get it is to visit the Pathfinder Society Organzed Play area\
  \ on the second floor of the convention center overlooking the exhibit hall.)</li>\
  \ \n     <li>Pick up a Gen Con-exclusive edition of the very first issue of the\
  \ brand-new <a href=\"/products/btpy8tw3?Pathfinder-1\">Pathfinder comic</a> at\
  \ the booth, then have your limited-edition collectible autographed by writer Jim\
  \ Zub and artist Andrew Huerta, who will both be signing through the convention.\
  \ Andrew will even be doing character drawings all weekend long!</li> \n     <li>Be\
  \ among the very first to get a copy of <a href=\"/products/btpy8rcd\">Ultimate\
  \ Equipment</a>, the huge new hardcover item catalog for the Pathfinder RPG! With\
  \ thousands of magic and mundane items, the book is sure to have the perfect gift\
  \ for your favorite player character. Don’t you think he deserves a special gift\
  \ from the convention, too?</li> \n     <li>Gamers who finish an event in the Pathfinder\
  \ Society Organized Play room on the second floor of the convention center receive\
  \ special wooden coins produced to commemorate the new season of play, the Year\
  \ of the Risen Rune. Turn in your coins at HQ for a chance to win exciting in-campaign\
  \ prizes!</li> \n     <li>Check the program book and the posted list at the Paizo\
  \ booth for a look at more than a dozen seminars and panels we’re putting on at\
  \ the show. From a look behind the scenes at the Rise of the Runelords Anniversary\
  \ Edition to Pathfinder RPG rules workshops to 10 Years of Paizo retrospectives\
  \ to discussions of topics like the art of Pathfinder or the Pathfinder Online MMO,\
  \ we’ve got all kinds of exciting events going on every day of the convention. </li>\
  \ \n     <li>A crate of adorable little plush goblins was seen in Anchorage, Alaska\
  \ today, en route (so they say) to the <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lds3?We-have-a-helper-setting-up-the-booth\"\
  >Paizo booth at Gen Con</a>. Should these rumors prove true, it means Gen Con attendees\
  \ will be the first people on Earth with the chance to adopt their very own <a href=\"\
  /store/toys/plushes/pathfinder\">plush Pathfinder goblins</a>. Lock up your dogs\
  \ and bring home the best Gen Con gift you can ever give your family—a loveable\
  \ new member!</li> \n     <li>Stop by for a chat with the hard-working members of\
  \ the Paizo staff. If you appreciate what we do, let us know! There’s nothing like\
  \ a face-to-face compliment to recharge the old batteries. On the other hand, if\
  \ there’s something we could be doing better to make Pathfinder more appealing to\
  \ you, we’d love to hear about it. </li>\n    </ol> \n    <p><b>Gen Con Tips</b></p>\
  \ \n    <ol>\n     <li>Schedule several hours (or more, if you’re a compulsive game\
  \ collector or demo fiend) for the exhibit hall. Resist the temptation to fill every\
  \ hour of every day with gaming (but oh, what a way to go!), because if you neglect\
  \ a thorough investigation of the exhibit hall, you’re missing out on one of the\
  \ things that makes Gen Con such a great experience. </li> \n     <li>Wander randomly\
  \ a bit. There’s no way to distill a convention as large and as crazy as Gen Con\
  \ in a web article or even a full convention book. Sometimes you’ve just got to\
  \ see it yourself. Wander through the miniatures gaming hall. Check out a demo of\
  \ a game you’ve never heard of, even join a random pick-up game. The best memories\
  \ from Gen Con often involve situations you hadn’t anticipated until they started\
  \ happening around you. </li> \n     <li>You’ve got to do the True Dungeon. Even\
  \ if it’s sold out, I often hear of folks with extra tickets looking for someone\
  \ to go with them. If you don’t have tickets and hear such an offer, jump on it\
  \ immediately. It’s quite an amazing experience, and well worth the time, cost,\
  \ and effort involved. You won’t quite feel like a “real” adventurer after going\
  \ through the True Dungeon, but you will certainly appreciate the value of a good\
  \ torch. It’s dark in there!</li> \n     <li>Make some new friends. From the PFS\
  \ room to the Paizo booth to the informal chats that often break out following a\
  \ seminar, Gen Con is a great place to meet gamers with similar interests to your\
  \ own. Don’t be afraid to strike up a conversation with your fellow gamers. Maybe\
  \ you’re in line at a restaurant, or waiting to get assigned to an organized play\
  \ table. Either way, the place is packed with potential friendships. Take advantage\
  \ of the opportunity to meet some new people.</li> \n     <li>Take photographs.\
  \ These days most of us have incredible cameras in our phones. Use them. Take snaps\
  \ of the cool displays you see in the exhibit hall, cool architecture you see in\
  \ Indianapolis, and cool people you game with. Stimuli hits you so fast and furious\
  \ at Gen Con even the incredible can start to seem sort of normal. “Oh, what, a\
  \ dude dressed in a full-on goat costume with working neon rays shooting out of\
  \ his eyes seated on a throne and palanquin being carried by a procession of short\
  \ stormtroopers? SEEN it!” Yeah, you’re going to want to tell someone about that\
  \ later, even if it doesn’t seem like that big of a deal compared to the dozen other\
  \ amazing things you saw in the prior 10 minutes. Take a picture. It’ll last longer.</li>\
  \ \n     <li>Set aside a little money to pick up a gift for your significant other,\
  \ even if said other isn’t really into gaming. There’s plenty of cool non-gaming\
  \ stuff for sale at Gen Con, from novelty T-shirts to toys to jewelry. Find something\
  \ that certain someone would appreciate, and get it. They put up with a lot from\
  \ gaming, and if they aren’t with you, they’re probably holding down the fort back\
  \ home and would appreciate the thought. If they are with you at the convention,\
  \ you have won the significant other lottery, and don’t really need my advice. Keep\
  \ doing what you are doing. </li>\n    </ol> \n    <div class=\"blurb180\">\n  \

  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p><b>Indianapolis Tips</b></p> \n    <ol>\n     <li>Don’\
  t neglect nourishment. The convention hall is good for a hot dog in a dire emergency,\
  \ but Indianapolis has a nice selection of restaurants within walking distance.\
  \ The Ram is always jam packed with gamers, and the Circle Center food court (accessible\
  \ by skybridge from the Convention Center) has a variety of, well, food court options.\
  \ While there, I often grab a fruit smoothie to remind myself about wholesomeness,\
  \ since it’s not exactly on offer at places like Steak N’Shake and White Castle.\
  \ Mmmmm. White Castle.</li> \n     <li>Go to White Castle.</li> \n     <li>It gets\
  \ hot. Oh, lordy, it gets hot. Pack an extra set of socks. After a full day of trekking\
  \ from panel to panel and back and forth to meals in a soggy Midwestern summer,\
  \ your feet will love you for a quick sock-swap before dinner. And bring comfortable\
  \ shoes, as well. Your feet and you are not necessarily going to be the best of\
  \ friends at the end of the weekend, so it’s best to make sure things remain comfortable\
  \ between the three of you for as long as possible. </li> \n     <li>Don’t forget\
  \ to sleep. You’re going to be tempted to game into the wee hours, to close down\
  \ the bar, and to play more games after that. Don’t. Or at least don’t every night.\
  \ You’ve waited a long time (and spent a pile of money) to get to Gen Con. You owe\
  \ it to yourself to experience at least a little of it with clear eyes on at least\
  \ a half night’s rest. Man cannot survive on gaming, booze, and 5-Hour Energy alone\
  \ (trust me, I’ve tried). </li>\n    </ol> \n    <p><b>The Most Important Tip</b></p>\
  \ \n    <ul>\n     <li>After the spending spree of travel bills and exhibit hall\
  \ excursions, it’s time to start planning how to afford the trip to NEXT YEAR’s\
  \ Gen Con. Because seriously, once you go once, you’re going to want to go every\
  \ year. </li>\n    </ul> \n   </blockquote> \n   <p>I mean, look at me. I’ve been\
  \ to 17 of these things, and have no plans to stop any time soon.</p> \n   <p>My\
  \ plane for Number Eighteen leaves in 10 hours! </p> \n   <p>See you at the show!</p>\
