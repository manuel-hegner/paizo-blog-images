  \ Neal F. Litherland</p> \n    <h2>Chapter Two: Scouting Party</h2> \n    <div itemprop=\"\
  articleBody\"> \n     <p><span itemprop=\"description\">The place looked more like\
  \ a kicked anthill than an iron mine. Built of heavy bulwarks of timber and stone,\
  \ its arms curved out from the mountain like a mother's arms around her belly. A\
  \ hundred eyes peered out of the crenelated sockets, sweeping the land. The gate\
  \ was simply a drawbridge that spanned a dry moat filled with dust and splintered\
  \ stakes. Pitch or filth lined the bottom—it was impossible to tell from so far\
  \ away. A portcullis hung ready to fall, cutting the people inside off from anything\
  \ short of heavy bombardment. Parties of guards, some on foot and some on horse,\
  \ went in and out, regular as an old man on a steady diet.</span></p> \n     <p>\"\
  Place is a fortress,\" Gunner said.</p> \n     <p>Chaplain snorted. \"It's also\
  \ poorly built.\"</p> \n     <p>\"A poorly built fortress is still a fortress,\"\
  \ Gunner grumbled.</p> \n     <p>They lapsed into silence, lying or crouching along\
  \ the ridge top and drawing as little attention to themselves as possible. The guards\
  \ would be unlikely to notice the band unless they moved quickly, or stood out against\
  \ the backdrop of the scrub trees and hardy bushes. So they sat, waited, and watched.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Looks as if our friend Robbes gave the commander quite the earful\
  \ about what we did to his little caravan.\" The Lieutenant barked a rough, sharp\
  \ sound that was as close as he got to laughter. \"They're giving us a right heroes'\
  \ welcome.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Tell me again why we want them to know we're coming?\"\
  \ Trilaina asked. </p> \n     <p>Lieutenant Hook snapped his spyglass closed and\
  \ slid it back among the legion of pouches slung around his narrow hips.</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"It's all part of the plan.\" The Lieutenant scuttled back from the precipice\
  \ like a crab, and the others followed, slinking and scraping out of the line of\
  \ sight. Once they'd slipped into a wash, they knelt and drew close. The Lieutenant\
  \ brushed the sand flat and drew in the dust. \"Now pay attention.\"</p> \n    \
  \ <p>The old man laid out the mine in small lines, giving a rough distance from\
  \ the front gate to the rise they'd been watching from. He mapped out the paths\
  \ visible from where they'd been sitting, like veins stretching out from a hard\
  \ little heart. He carefully included the hundred yards or so of completely clear\
  \ land leading up to the walls. Gunner reached over and added a few branches, his\
  \ lines thicker and harder. No one questioned the gnome's eyes.</p> \n     <p>\"\
  This is our position here.\" The Lieutenant drew an X with his fingernail, light\
  \ enough that it was barely noticeable. \"We've got some daylight left, and until\
  \ that fades we'll be most vulnerable. So we're going to hold this position until\
  \ night falls, and when it does, we'll-\"</p> \n     <p>Denna growled, jutting her\
  \ head forward across the map at Trilaina. The half-elf's eyes widened and she backed\
  \ away, holding her hands out in front of her.</p> \n     <p>\"Denna,\" Gunner chided,\
  \ putting a hand on her mane. </p> \n     <p>That was when an arrow buried itself\
  \ in the she-wolf's side, turning her growl into a yelp of pain as she fell over.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The Irregulars stood, backs together and hands on hilts. In the time\
  \ it took them to reach their feet, both ends of the little ditch filled with Molthuni\
  \ soldiers. The rag-tag Andoren squad stood at the bottom, looking up at a trap\
  \ they'd never even noticed. The ambushers had arrows knocked, bows taut as heartstrings\
  \ and eyes cold as winter wine. A man stepped out of the scrub from behind Trilaina,\
  \ pulling a new arrow from a quiver on his hip.</p> \n     <p>\"Put your hands up\
  \ and surrender,\" he commanded.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb360\">\n      <a href=\"\

  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n      <br> Gunner and Denna make quite the team.\n     </div>\
  \ \n     <p>\"I told you they'd be here!\" A voice called from the left flank. \"\
  I saw the flash on the lens!\"</p> \n     <p>\"Now's not the time, Theron.\" The\
  \ older man spoke without taking his eyes off the five interlopers and their wounded\
  \ wolf. \"If you do not put your hands up and surrender, I will have my men open\
  \ fire.\"</p> \n     <p>The captured Andorens raised their hands slowly, gazes sweeping\
  \ back and forth over the outriders that had clearly been dispatched to comb the\
  \ foothills. They'd apparently doubled back. There was no give in them, and no relaxation\
  \ as their prisoners-to-be showed empty hands.</p> \n     <p>\"Irregulars,\" the\
  \ Lieutenant said with a death's-head smile. \"Smoke 'em if you got 'em.\"</p> \n\
  \     <p>Glass broke, and thick, yellow smoke rose in a plume around the little\
  \ group. Both flanks of ambushers loosed, smooth and cool. The Lieutenant swore,\
  \ and there was a gnome-sized thud as Gunner went down. The soldiers reached for\
  \ more arrows, uncertain whether their targets were even still there. </p> \n  \
  \   <p>Then the smoke cleared, and madness descended.</p> \n     <p>Twin daggers\
  \ flicked through the air, tumbling end over end towards the left flank. One archer\
  \ cried out, his words bubbling from his throat in a bloody spray. Another dropped\
  \ his bow, clutching at fingers cut to the bone. Garm exploded up the hill, teeth\
  \ bared in a tusked snarl that would have put fear into iron. Another Molthuni—\
  the one their captain had called Theron—loosed a shaft, but the half-orc slapped\
  \ it out of his path. His fist swung back like death's own pendulum, breaking bones\
  \ and sending the injured bowman to join his companion.</p> \n     <p>Bowstrings\
  \ twanged again on the right flank, but before they could be drawn a third time\
  \ a single glass vial arced out of the vanishing smoke. It shattered, and bottled\
  \ lightning crackled, snarling over the soldiers and leaving them twitching. Chaplain\
  \ came on behind it, undaunted, swinging her hammer in a wide arc. It crushed leather\
  \ and bone alike, doing its nasty work at a piston pace while the cleric drove the\
  \ men down like tent stakes.</p> \n     <p>\"Bastards!\" The leader of the Molthuni\
  \ outriders cried out as he drew an arrow’s fletching to his cheek. \"You bastards,\
  \ I'll—\"</p> \n     <p>Whatever else he would have said was cut off by the twang\
  \ of Gunner's infernal engine. He unleashed a full load of bolts in the blink of\
  \ an eye, and they flew like darts flung by a giant, slamming into the trunk of\
  \ the leader's chest with nary a finger's breadth between them. The man fell back,\
  \ his arrow streaking for the low scudding clouds.</p> \n     <p>\"Regroup!\" The\
  \ Lieutenant snarled, waving away the last of the smoke. \"Status!\"</p> \n    \
  \ <p>\"One prisoner, sir,\" Garm called. He marched Theron down the hill, one of\
  \ the man's arms twisted up behind his back and Garm's hand around his throat, making\
  \ certain he couldn't scream. Trilaina retrieved her daggers from the dead men and\
  \ drug a double trench along each side of the soldiers' necks, just to be safe.\
  \ Chaplain said a quick prayer, then rifled pouches and weapon belts looking for\
  \ anything useful. Denna whined and licked Gunner. The gnome coughed, shifting on\
  \ his back.</p> \n     <p>\"Easy, girl.\" He grunted and tugged at the arrows stuck\
  \ in his armor. The Lieutenant put a foot on the gnome's chest and pulled, the bent-tipped\
  \ barbs grating on steel.</p> \n     <p>\"Looks like the extra chain came in handy\
  \ after all,\" The Lieutenant said. </p> \n     <p>Gunner grinned. \"It's a heavy\
  \ bastard, is all,\" he said. \"Help me up, I need to see to Denna before she makes\
  \ herself worse.\"</p> \n     <p>Chaplain gave him a hand and Gunner struggled back\
  \ to his feet. He caught the she-wolf's teeth on his bracer and shushed her. He\
  \ pulled, she bit, and the offending shaft slipped free with barely a protest. Gunner\
  \ whispered, speaking in the voice of wind and rain while he dragged his fingers\
  \ through Denna's fur like he was raking out a bloody burr. The wound came free,\
  \ its lips sealed as if it had never been. Only a small bald patch gave testament.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"And here it was I thought she still didn't like me,\" Trilaina said.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>Denna growled, a low rumble of thunder deep in her chest. Trilaina\
  \ retreated a step, and Gunner scratched the wolf under the muzzle.</p> \n     <p>\"\
  She doesn't,\" he said. \"Bastard's lucky he came from behind you. She started growling\
  \ at Garm, I'd have shot first and asked questions later.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Not\
  \ my fault I'm prettier,\" Garm said. </p> \n     <p>Theron's eyes were wild, and\
  \ he clawed at Garm's hand. The boy—which is what he really was, now that they saw\
  \ him up close—may as well have tried to chop down a tree with his cheekbones.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Beauty's in the eye of the beholder,\" Trilaina said, the words dry\
  \ as hardroot cider. Garm dropped the boy, coughing and gagging, in front of the\
  \ little map they'd drawn only moments ago. It was scuffed, but still legible.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"If you're going to kill me, just do it and get it over with.\" Theron\
  \ had probably meant it to sound defiant, but it came out a gallows whisper. The\
  \ Lieutenant hunkered across the map, looking at Theron as if he was an out-of-season\
  \ fruit. Something to be picked when the opportunity presented.</p> \n     <p>\"\
  Whether you die here with no one but the gods to see is entirely up to you,\" Hook\
  \ said. </p> \n     <p>Theron waited. The Lieutenant waited. It didn't take long\
  \ for the tow-headed captive to crack.</p> \n     <p>\"You'll never get in that\
  \ gate,\" he said. \"The mine is locked down and everyone's watching. Commander\
  \ Hartwick has already sent word to the Cettigne garrison requesting reinforcements.\
  \ They’ll be here by midday tomorrow.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Fortunate we never intended\
  \ on going in that gate,\" the Lieutenant said, half his mouth curling in a sly\
  \ grin. \"Show me where the Deserter's Door is, and you get to live.\"</p> \n  \
  \   <p>\"The Deserter's Door?\" Theron asked. </p> \n     <p>The Lieutenant snapped\
  \ his teeth, and the boy jumped.</p> \n     <p>\"Everyone's determined to prove\
  \ themselves a fool.\" The Lieutenant leaned forward, nostrils flaring. \"The secret\
  \ escape route discovered by a work crew ten years ago. It was closed up tight and\
  \ guarded. It's been kept as a final option by the mine overseer since then in case\
  \ of overwhelming assault, since it comes out the back side of that little hill\
  \ from the front gate. You strike me as a curious boy, Theron. I'm sure you've seen\
  \ it.\"</p> \n     <p>\"And if I have?\" Theron asked.</p> \n     <p>\"Then you\
  \ tell us where it is, and you walk,\" the Lieutenant said.</p> \n     <p>\"Just\
  \ like that?\" Theron’s disbelief was obvious.</p> \n     <p>\"Of course.\" The\
  \ Lieutenant leaned in close to the boy. \"The brand on your right arm labels you\
  \ a conscript. You're a slave trying to make good. If you tell us where this gate\
  \ is and you go back, you'll be killed for cowardice and consorting with the enemy.\
  \ But if you walk away from here right now—well, there's no one to say what really\
  \ happened up here, is there?\" </p> \n     <p>Without hesitation, Theron stretched\
  \ out an arm and marked a spot northeast of the mine's main gate. Lost in the crags,\
  \ it would take them until nightfall to get there if they didn't want to be seen.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>The Lieutenant smiled. \"Good boy.\"</p> \n     <p>\"So what now?\"\
  \ Theron asked.</p> \n     <p>The Lieutenant nodded, and Garm's fist crashed into\
  \ the side of Theron's face. Blood ran, and the boy's eyes didn't quite know where\
  \ to look as he tried to sit up. His teeth were still in place, and nothing appeared\
  \ broken.</p> \n     <p>\"You walk away.\" The Lieutenant stood. \"That will swell\
  \ up right pretty in half a turn or so. You walk out of the foothills toward the\
  \ river. If someone stops you, you tell them you were sent running and got turned\
  \ around—the bump to the head addled your brains. That bruise will corroborate your\
  \ story and keep you from looking too much like a deserter. If you're lucky, you'll\
  \ make it all the way out of Molthune, and we'll never see you again.\"</p> \n \
  \    <p>Theron sat, the words sinking in slow. Finally he hauled himself to his\
  \ feet and offered a shaky salute. The Lieutenant returned it, and the boy walked\
  \ away until he was out of sight.</p> \n     <p>\"Conscripts,\" Garm said, and shook\
  \ his head.</p> \n     <p>The Lieutenant jerked his chin toward the mountain. \"\
  There's more out there,\" he said. \"Irregulars, keep your mouths shut, and your\
  \ ears open. There are people counting on us in that mine, and I would hate to disappoint\
  \ them.\"</p> \n     <p><b>Coming Next Week:</b> Plotting a prison break in Chapter\
