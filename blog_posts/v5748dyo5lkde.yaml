  \ href=\"/products/btpy9x0w?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-107-The-Solar-Sortie\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society #1-07: The Solar Sortie</em></a> by Paizo freelance veteran,\
  \ Jenny Jarzabski. I've known Jenny for years, and she's made numerous contributions\
  \ to the Pathfinder line. She's worked on printed projects like <a href=\"/products/btpy9jbd?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Heaven-Unleashed\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Heaven Unleashed</em></a> and <a href=\"/products/btpy9oo9?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Paths-of-the-Righteous\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Player Companion: Paths of the Righteous</em></a>, as well as on\
  \ Pathfinder Society projects like <a href=\"/products/btpy9mb9?Pathfinder-Society-Quest-Honors-Echo\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Quests: Honor's Echo</em></a> and <a href=\"/products/btpy9oii?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-805-Ungrounded-but-Unbroken\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-05: Ungrounded but Unbroken</em></a>.</p> \n\
  \    <p>I always get the chance to meet-up with Jenny at Gen Con, and knew before\
  \ this year's convention that I wanted to give her a chance to write a Starfinder\
  \ Society scenario. When we inevitably met up at the convention, I posed an open-ended\
  \ question about what Jenny would like to do with a scenario along with some rough\
  \ guidelines of certain tags she had to conform to. By the end of the convention,\
  \ Jenny blindsided me with a fantastic pitch: \"I want the PCs to have to manage\
  \ and impress a rich socialite.\"</p> \n    <p>Taking some story cues from <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8wdz?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-4-19-The-Night-March-of-Kalkamedes\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #4-19: The Night March of Kalkamedes</em></a>,\
  \ this month's Starfinder Society scenario requires a group of dedicated PCs help\
  \ the Dataphiles faction leader, Historia-7. As the last faction to get a faction-tagged\
  \ scenario, the Dataphiles haven't been idle, and Historia-7 has uncovered hints\
  \ of a wider conspiracy arrayed against the Society. Her data leads her to Brilliance\
  \ station, a space station orbiting the Pact Worlds' sun. The Society may not be\
  \ in a position to break in and forcefully take the data they need, but Historia-7's\
  \ found a weakness in the station's hierarchy: the reputed \"king of selfies,\"\
  \ Envar Tamm.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb180\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/StarfinderSociety/PZOSFS0107E-Envar.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/StarfinderSociety/PZOSFS0107E-Envar_180.jpeg\"></a> \n\
  \     <p><i>Illustrations by Benjamin Widdowson</i></p>\n    </div> \n    <p>I suspect\
  \ that Envar Tamm is going to be one of those NPCs that players just love to hate.\
  \ Exactly why this is the case, is something I'm going to wait until players get\
  \ a chance to try out the scenario. I will say, the art for Envar (displayed below)\
  \ is spot on, and he's likely exactly the type of NPC you assume him to be from\
  \ first glance. Jenny did a phenomenal job at showcasing a very different style\
  \ of scenario than we're used to seeing in Starfinder Society. She's combined the\
  \ high-stakes element of an infiltration mission alongside a cast of characters\
  \ that are both ridiculous and completely plausible. In reading the turnover text\
  \ for this scenario, I went into three separate laughing fits from some of the presented\
  \ scenes*. So, it's safe to say that The Solar Sortie should be a memorable experience\
  \ for characters and—while still a high stakes endeavor—an event that can bring\
  \ some much needed levity around the holiday season.</p> \n    <p>This scenario\
  \ uses the Faction (Dataphiles) and Starship scenario tags.</p> \n    <p>As a heads\
  \ up, due to some space gremlins getting into the works, we're going to be swapping\
  \ the order of our next two announced scenarios. This is to help alleviate some\
  \ development burdens, and smooth the transition to some other (as of yet unannounced)\
  \ initiatives that we'll be sharing in the coming weeks. So, expect to hear more\
  \ about Starfinder Society #1-08: Sanctuary of Drowned Delight in my next scenario\
  \ preview blog. This upcoming scenario is set to bring the Wayfinders faction back\
  \ into the spotlight.</p> \n    <p>Happy Holidays!</p> \n    <p>Thurston Hillman<br>\
  \ <i>Starfinder Society Developer</i></p> \n    <p class=\"tiny\">*Sorry Jenny,\
  \ I just don't think most PCs would take Profession (Sommelier), so I had to take\
  \ that line out.</p> \n   </div> \n  </blockquote> <!-- tags: Organized Play, Starfinder\
