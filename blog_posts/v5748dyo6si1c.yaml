  \ itemprop=\"description\">We are just under a month until PaizoCon! That’s not\
  \ an incredibly stressful thought at all! I’m looking forward to seeing the community\
  \ at PaizoCon in Seattle, as well as at PaizoCon Online. We’ll be premiering a brand\
  \ new season of Starfinder Society, our first levels 9-12 Pathfinder Society adventure,\
  \ and a new Starfinder interactive special. We’ll also be announcing the title and\
  \ theme of Pathfinder Society Year 4 during our Organized Play panel. I hope you’\
  re ready for all the new content!</p> \n      <h2>Digital Releases</h2> \n     \
  \ <p>Here are this month’s digital releases, available June 1, 2022:</p> \n    \

  \ \n      <p><em>*part of a subscription</em></p> \n      <br> \n      <h2>Sanctioning</h2>\
  \ \n      <p>Even in the height of convention season, sanctioning continues apace!\
  \ Last week we posted sanctioning for <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq029wb\"\
  ><em>Book of the Dead</em></a>, including character options and the included adventure,\
  \ “March of the Dead.” We also had <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6si0t?Organized-Play-Sanctioning-Update-April-2022\"\
  >a blog</a> that talked about our sanctioning process regarding <em>Book of the\
  \ Dead</em>.</p> \n      <p>Coming up soon, we have <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02c3a\"\
  ><em>Knights of Lastwall</em></a> for PFS2 and <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02aly\"\
  ><em>Drift Crisis</em></a> for SFS. Both release at the end of May, and we’re hoping\
  \ to have sanctioning ready for both on their street date. The <a href=\"https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventures/adventurePath/horizonsOfTheVast\"\
  ><em>Horizons of the Vast</em></a> Adventure Path documents are in their final stages,\
  \ and we hope to have those out to you soon as well. After all that, we’ll start\
  \ to get weird with <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02arq?Pathfinder-Dark-Archive\"\
  ><em>Dark Archive</em></a>!</p> \n      <br> \n      <h2>Boon Updates</h2> \n  \
  \    <p>After a discussion with some of our volunteers, we’re making a minor change\
  \ to the boons which unlock versatile heritages. Each boon will have one or more\
  \ languages added; characters with that heritage also have access to the language(s),\
  \ as listed, though they still must take them when they would take any other language.\
  \ If you previously had a character with these heritages and would like to swap\
  \ one of their languages for a newly-accessible language, you may do so for free\
  \ at this time. The languages added are:</p> \n      <ul> \n       <li>Aphorite:\
  \ Utopian</li> \n       <li>Aasimar: Celestial</li> \n       <li>Changeling: Aklo</li>\
  \ \n       <li>Dhampir: Necril</li> \n       <li>Duskwalker: Requian</li> \n   \
  \    <li>Ganzi: Protean</li> \n       <li>Ifrit: Ignan</li> \n       <li>Oread:\
  \ Terran</li> \n       <li>Suli: choose one of Ignan, Terran, Auran or Aquan; Suli\
  \ with the Dualborn feat may choose two of these</li> \n       <li>Sylph: Auran</li>\
  \ \n       <li>Tiefling: choose one of Abyssal, Daemonic, or Infernal</li> \n  \
  \     <li>Undine: Aquan</li> \n      </ul> \n      <br> \n      <h2>Guide Updates</h2>\
  \ \n      <p>In advance of the new seasons, we have some updates to the PFS and\
  \ SFS Guides to Organized Play! Here are some highlights:</p> \n      <ul> \n  \
  \     <li>In PFS2, having access to a character option (such as an item) does not\
  \ make that option common in any way. This had a strange interaction with things\
  \ like crafting DCs, so we’re clarifying that point to bring the rules in line with\
  \ the default from the <em>Gamemastery Guide</em>. Having access means you can take/purchase\
  \ that option, but that’s it.</li> \n       <li>Relatedly, having access to a scroll\
  \ does not inherently grant access to the spell on that scroll, but spellcasters\
  \ can still purchase that scroll and then Learn a Spell to learn it.</li> \n   \
  \    <li>Also in PFS2, the rules about how to handle errata have been updated to\
  \ bring them in line with the rules from SFS. If a feat’s prerequisites change,\
  \ or it’s removed from the campaign, you may freely swap out the feat and any subsequent\
  \ feats that depend on it. There were a couple of feats that changed with the recent\
  \ APG errata, and this should cover the free swaps for affected players.</li> \n\
  \       <li>For both programs, we have updated the requirements for 5-rank GMs regarding\
  \ who can conduct evaluations. To better serve those GMs who live in remote areas\
  \ or otherwise find it difficult to get evaluators at their tables, RVCs can now\
  \ appoint qualified individuals to conduct evaluations.</li> \n       <li>Finally,\
  \ PVP combat is not permitted in Paizo Organized Play. Previously, engaging in PVP\
  \ combat would earn Infamy, but Infamy is not meant to be a consequence for out-of-game\
  \ behavior. You may not fight other players’ characters unless the scenario calls\
  \ for it for some extremely specific reason.</li> \n      </ul> \n      <p>Full\
  \ details on all these changes, as well as some other minor changes, can be found\
  \ in the relevant changelogs.</p> \n      <br> \n      <h2>GM Recognition</h2> \n\
  \      <p>We don’t have any new 5-rank GMs this month, so I wanted to take a moment\
  \ to talk about the Campaign Service Coins! These awards are given to exceptional\
  \ volunteers who go above and beyond the call of duty in service to the program.\
  \ The award is a physical metal coin, stamped with the user’s brand-new three-digit\
  \ Organized Play ID. If someone at your table has an Organized Play ID in the 700s\
  \ or 800s, they’ve received one of these coins.</p> \n      <p>Nominations for this\
  \ award are accepted anytime. If you wish to nominate an individual, please email\
  \ organizedplay@paizo.com with the recipient’s name and the ways they have gone\
  \ above and beyond. As we return to physical events, I’m hoping to be able to travel\
  \ more and hand some of these out, so knowing what events the nominee is traveling\
  \ to helps as well. Anybody can make a nomination, and recipients are not limited\
  \ to Venture Officers.</p> \n      <p>Until next time—Explore! Report! Cooperate!\
  \ And we’ll see you at PaizoCon!</p> \n      <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight:\
