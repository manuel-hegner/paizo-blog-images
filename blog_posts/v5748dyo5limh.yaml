  \ design challenge contest, in which I tasked you, our fans, to take our iconics\
  \ to the darker side of the alignment chart!</p> \n     <p>First of all, I would\
  \ like to thank everybody for participating. There was a lot of really excellent\
  \ entries, encompassing 29 different iconics, and all of them different enough from\
  \ each other that I had a hard time choosing our finalists! Kyra the Cleric was\
  \ the top favorite, with six different variations, followed by Jirelle the Swashbuckler,\
  \ and all of the entries avoided the moustache-twirling evil that we try and avoid\
  \ in our own antagonists. Well done, everyone! Let's get our runners-up out of the\
  \ way, who will each earn $10 in store credit for their entries!</p> \n     <div\

  \ Lini embraces the darker, crueler aspects of nature.</p> \n     <blockquote> \n\
  \      <div class=\"stat-block\"> \n       <p class=\"stat-block-title\">Lini the\
  \ Cruel—CR 3</p> \n       <p class=\"flavor-text\" style=\"font-style: italic; padding-left:\
  \ 1em; padding-right: 1em;\">After being viciously mauled by a snow leopard and\
  \ left for dead by her Enclave, Lini managed to escape the beast with her life—\
  barely. Horribly scarred and angry at both her kin and the beast, Lini treated her\
  \ wounds as well as she could and bided her time, stalking the snow leopard over\
  \ the course of days and learning its habits while using stealth and her magic to\
  \ hide from its senses. Eventually Lini struck, sneaking into the snow leopard’\
  s lair while it was out, killing all of its cubs and then beating the beast into\
  \ submission (with heavy use of poisons). She turned the cubs pelts into a cloak,\
  \ their teeth and claws into jewelry and spent the next two years breaking the snow\
  \ leopard, viciously training it into her loyal defender. Now, she and Droogami\
  \ stalk the lands as bandits and mercenaries, inflicting violence for coin and the\
  \ sheer joy of it.</p> \n      </div> \n     </blockquote> \n     <div style=\"\

  stat-block-breaker\">Tactics</p> \n         <p><strong>Before Combat</strong> Lini\
  \ applies poison to her weapons daily or before engaging enemies (using blue whinnis\
  \ only when she intends to take someone alive). If she knows she will be fighting\
  \ in a building or facing multiple enemies she casts <em>call animal</em> and handles\
  \ or <em>charms</em> the animal as necessary at least an hour before approaching.\
  \ Once prepared, Lini stalks her prey from afar studying them (with studied target)\
  \ and her surroundings before approaching. She uses stealth and the terrain to her\
  \ advantage, hiding behind or atop of buildings, trees and other obstacles. Before\
  \ fighting she casts <em>barkskin</em> and <em>bull’s strength</em> on herself.</p>\
  \ \n         <p><strong>During Combat</strong> If Lini has called an animal to her\
  \ side she directs the animal first, typically pushing it to enter the building\
  \ and attack everyone inside or to attack a large group of enemies. She does not\
  \ expect the animal to survive such tactics and does not make any effort to save\
  \ or assist it. After the animal is unleashed or, if there is no called animal,\
  \ Lini and Droogami stalk as near to their targets as they can without being spotted,\
  \ from opposite directions. Lini studies her target and attacks from hiding with\
  \ one of her poisoned weapons or <em>stone discus</em> while Droogami fights in\
  \ melee combat. Once enemies are aware of her presence Lini prefers to fight in\
  \ close ranged combat with her darts or <em>produce flame</em> using Acrobatics\
  \ to remain mobile. If the terrain provides potential cover she utilizes skirmishing\
  \ tactics, breaking line of sight with her enemies, stealthing to a different location\
  \ and attacking again from hiding to gain her sneak attack damage. Once personally\
  \ engaged in melee combat Lini fights with her sickle, flanking with Droogami at\
  \ all times. If wounded, Lini temporarily retreats from combat leaving Droogami\
  \ to continue the fight, heals herself with her <em>wand of cure light wounds</em>\
  \ and then returns to combat (preferably unnoticed). Lini takes the time to cure\
  \ Droogami if he is below half of his hit points, but only if doing so won’t cause\
  \ her any harm. She will not put herself in danger for Droogami.</p> \n        \
  \ <p><strong>Morale</strong> Lini values her life above all others and will happily\
  \ sacrifice anyone, including Droogami, to protect herself. Unless Lini orders otherwise,\
  \ Droogami fights to the death to protect her. If Lini is reduced to half of her\
  \ hit points she retreats to heal herself while Droogami continues fighting. Once\
  \ she is healed, if Droogami still lives, Lini reenters combat, otherwise she flees\
  \ using acrobatics and stealth to her advantage and hiding if necessary.</p> \n\
