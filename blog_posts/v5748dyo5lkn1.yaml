  \     </div> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Hail and well met, Pathfinders!\
  \ We're getting close to the end of our trek through the <a href=\"/products/btpy9y9m?Pathfinder-Battles-Jungle-of-Despair\"\
  ><em>Jungle of Despair</em></a>, and we'll be free and clear with a month to spare\
  \ before its May release. No jungle is complete without animals to call it home,\
  \ both benign herbivores like the slow-moving sloth and docile deer, and more deadly\
  \ predators. What fun is a mini of a sloth, though? Let's take a look at some of\
  \ those hunters!</p> \n     <p>First we have the lion, the so-called \"king of the\
  \ jungle.\" Now, you and I know that lions really live on the plains, but who am\
  \ I to argue with one if he wants to be known by an inaccurate royal name? I've\
  \ seen the videos of lions attacking, so I'll just call this one king of whatever\
  \ he wants me to. The lion is a Large uncommon figure.</p> \n     <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180324-Lion.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180324-Lion_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Next, we have another great catâ€”and one that actually\
  \ lives and hunts in jungles, though it doesn't need such silly titles as the lion\
  \ king. No, the tiger is content to hunt in peace and quiet. And if painted white,\
  \ it might even do some magic tricks for you in a Vegas review. The tiger is a Large\
  \ uncommon figure.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180324-Tiger.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180324-Tiger_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>How does that line from \"The Wizard of Oz\" go? It's\
  \ \"lions and tigers and eagles, oh my,\" right? I think so, because that's what's\
  \ next in this blog's sequence, and I'd never deviate from canon by changing up\
  \ such an iconic listing of dangerous critters. The eagle makes an excellent animal\
  \ companion or a summoned creature, available to even low-level adventurers. A Small\
  \ uncommon figure, GMs everywhere will be saying, \"the eagle has landed\" in just\
  \ a little over a month's time.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a\
  \ href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180326-Eagle.jpg\"><img\
  \ src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180326-Eagle_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>The set has more than just these iconic apex predators\
  \ in it, however. After all, someone needs to clean up all the rotting, half-eaten\
  \ corpses left behind in the hunters' wake. Leave that to the vulture, a gross,\
  \ bald-headed scavenger bird sure to strike fear into players everywhere when a\
  \ few of them start to circle overhead. The vulture is a Small uncommon figure.</p>\
  \ \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180326-Vulture.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180326-Vulture_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>With all these wild animals about, we really could\
  \ use someone to train them. Fear not, for the human ranger is on the task! As a\
  \ Medium rare figure, he's still a steal for the lucky collector who pulls him from\
  \ a pack, because he's really two minis in one. With his trusty bird of prey perched\
  \ on his gloved hand, this figure pairs well with either of the two avians previewed\
  \ above.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20180326-HumanRanger.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Next week, we explore the horrors wrought by nature\
  \ run amok, but until then, enjoy the birdies and kitties revealed today; next week's\
  \ offerings won't be as kind.</p> \n     <p>Mark Moreland<br> <i>Franchise Manager</i></p>\
