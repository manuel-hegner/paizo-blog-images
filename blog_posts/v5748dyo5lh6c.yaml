  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">I was advised last year that\
  \ we needed to plan to make Gen Con 2014 the biggest and best yet. And it certainly\
  \ was! We scheduled 1,500 tables of <a href=\"/pathfindersociety\">Pathfinder Society</a>\
  \ during the convention. We showed the world our Kid's Beginner &amp; Advanced Tracks,\
  \ as well as the Pathfinder Beginner Box Introductions, Parts 1 and 2. We debuted\
  \ the <a href=\"/products/btpy98nh?Pathfinder-Society-Quest-The-Silverhex-Chronicles\"\
  ><em>Silverhex Chronicles Quests</em></a>. We hosted more than 20 seminars. And\
  \ we launched the <a href=\"/pfsacg\">Pathfinder Society Adventure Card Guild</a>!\
  \ Gen Con was definitely a success and Paizo's biggest showing in history. But we\
  \ can make it bigger and better this year!</p> \n    <p>Paizo will once again be\
  \ a cosponsor at this year's show. What does that mean for Pathfinder Society? It\
  \ means we return to the Sagamore Ballroom and we get the entire room! We increase\
  \ our playspace size, scheduling 180 tables per slot. We are moving the <a href=\"\
  /pfsacg\">Pathfinder Adventure Card Guild</a> into the Sagamore Ballroom and assigning\
  \ 20 tables that will be utilized just for Pathfinder Adventure Card Game play.\
  \ At Gen Con 2015, we're also debuting the <em>Adventure Card Guild Open</em>, a\
  \ tournament play option using tables of four players and pre-set scenarios with\
  \ no randomized elements; Tanis will share more about this even in an upcoming blog.\
  \ In addition, Pathfinder Adventure Card Game demos will be run during every hour\
  \ that the dealer hall is open.</p> \n    <p>Additionally, we have one of the 7\
  \ rooms that were used for Pathfinder Society in 2013. It will be used exclusively\
  \ for more than 20 Paizo seminars.</p> \n    <p>We are planning to schedule 17 different\
  \ scenarios, four Gen Con Specials, 2 modules, <a href=\"/products/btpy8j5w?Pathfinder-Module-We-Be-Goblins\"\
  ><em>We Be Goblins!</em></a> and <a href=\"/products/btpy8xc3?Pathfinder-Module-We-Be-Goblins-Too\"\

  \ \"True Dragons of Absalom,\" in which the players portray unlikely allies of the\
  \ Pathfinder Society using unique pregenerated kobold characters (Saturday night)</li>\
  \ \n     <li>The \"Serpents Rise\" Special in which the PCs are agents of the Aspis\
  \ Consortium bent on sabotaging the Pathfinder Society. Special pregenerated characters\
  \ are provided for this event on Sunday morning.</li>\n    </ul> \n    <p><b>Note:</b>\
  \ After Gen Con, the \"Serpents Rise\" pregenerated event will become available\
  \ to all 4-and 5-Star GMs to run as exclusives in their local areas. Additionally,\
  \ the \"True Dragons of Absalom\" special will become available to all 5-Star GMs\
  \ to run as exclusive events in their local areas.</p> \n    <h2>Beginner Box and\
  \ Kid's Track</h2> \n    <p>We have two different Beginner Box Introductions offerings\
  \ again this year. During 7 slots at Gen Con, we are setting aside 5 tables for\
  \ these Beginner Box Introduction events. Both parts are scheduled with new players\
  \ in mind. Beginner Box Introductions, Part 1 allows for the first 45—60 minutes\
  \ to be an exploration of the contents of the <em>Pathfinder RPG Beginner Box</em>,\
  \ explaining the rules, and reviewing the pregenerated characters. The final hours\
  \ of each slot involve playing through the 4 one-hour adventures. In Beginner Box\
  \ Introductions, Part 2, the GM will assist players in advancing their character\
  \ to third level. The Beginner Box Transitions, Player Pack, and GM Kit will be\
  \ reviewed. Once those 3 free documents have been briefly covered, we will be offering\
  \ up five, one-hour adventures as time permits. Much like the 4 adventures in part\
  \ one, these utilize only the <em>Beginner Box</em> rules.</p> \n    <p>For the\
  \ Pathfinder's Kids' Track, we will be setting aside 5 tables at 7 slots during\
  \ the convention. We are focusing on players aged 6—12 and will use the <em>Pathfinder\
  \ RPG Beginner Box</em> for this as well. The Kids' Track is divided into 2 parts:\
  \ the Beginner Track and the Advanced Track. Each Kid's Beginner Track slot will\
  \ be 2 hours long, and each player will receive a check-off card. The first hour\
  \ of each of the 7 Kids' Beginner Track sessions teaches roleplay and rules, and\
  \ reviews the pregenerated characters found in the <em>Pathfinder RPG Beginner Box</em>.\
  \ During the second hour, one of the 4 one-hour adventures used during the Beginner\
  \ Box Bash will be played.</p> \n    <p>For the Kids' Advanced Track, we are focusing\
  \ on children who participated in last year's Kids' Beginner Track, at a local Kids'\
  \ Beginner Track session near their home, or for older children that have prior\
  \ experience with Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. The GM at each of the two-hour slots\
  \ will help the children level their chosen character to third level. After leveling\
  \ is complete, the GM will run one of 5 new adventures designed using the <em>Beginner\
  \ Box</em> rules.</p> \n    <p>We will be running each of the 9 different, <em>Beginner\
  \ Box</em> adventures multiple times throughout the convention to allow flexible\
  \ scheduling for children and parents. We will be restricting tables to four children\
  \ players and are requiring a parent or guardian be present with their child (or\
  \ multiple children if they have two or more interested in participating) for the\
  \ entire 2 hours. The parent or guardian will assist the child when needed. But,\
  \ we want to make this a good and memorable experience for the kids that attend\
  \ Gen Con, who often find little they can participate in, especially with others\
  \ their own age. We will be scheduling 20, two-hour tables per day on Thursday through\
  \ Saturday, and 10, two-hour tables on Sunday, for the Kids' Track, divided between\
  \ the Beginner and Advanced Tracks.</p> \n    <p>If a child plays all 4 different\
  \ adventures in the Beginner's Track, he will be able to present his check-off card\
  \ to the prize table and receive a special certificate that celebrates his accomplishments.\
  \ If a child plays all 5 different adventures in the Advanced Track, she will be\
  \ able to present her check-off card to the prize table and receive a second, different\
  \ special certificate. Both certificates can be used for the child's new Pathfinder\
  \ Society character to advance from the <em>Beginner Box</em> to the full <em>Core\
  \ Rulebook</em> rules and participate in Pathfinder Society Organized Play. We may\
  \ also have other give-aways or special prizes, such as dice and miniatures, similar\
  \ to last year. I will be very picky when choosing volunteer GMs for the Kids' Track.\
  \ I prefer to have school teachers and other professionals with experience dealing\
  \ with children. I will consider GMs who are parents even if they do not deal with\
  \ children regularly in their profession. If you are volunteering to GM the Kids'\
  \ Track, please make sure to include all of your credentials. Also, since these\
  \ are scheduled as two-hour blocks, a GM will be required to run 2 Kids' Track slots\
  \ back to back in a five-hour block to count as 1 slot of credit toward GM rewards.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>We will also be running a new set of Pathfinder Quests, based around\
  \ the upcoming <a href=\"/products/btpy9a0h\"><em>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Occult\
  \ Adventures</em></a> hardcover, inside the Sagamore Ballroom, and I do have a few\
  \ volunteer spots of five-hour blocks for any GM interested in running those for\
  \ players as they show up and fill the quests tables.</p> \n    <h2>Volunteering\
  \ for Gen Con 2015</h2> \n    <p>Now, let's talk about the GMs and volunteers we\
  \ need to pull all of the above off and make it the biggest and best Gen Con ever.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>I need a minimum of 375 volunteer GMs for Pathfinder Society games, Beginner\
  \ Box Introductions, Kids' Track events, Pathfinder Quests, Pathfinder Adventure\
  \ Card Guild scenarios, and Adventure Card Game demos. I'll continue taking volunteer\
  \ GMs until the slots are filled, at which point I will create a waiting list in\
  \ the event that a scheduled GM has to cancel their Gen Con trip for whatever reason.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>I also need a few HQ Volunteer Assistants for each slot of the show.\
  \ These folks will not GM during their volunteer slots, but will instead help the\
  \ HQ Lead Volunteers and I run Pathfinder Society HQ, including marshalling, collecting\
  \ tickets, distributing GM packs, entering tracking sheets into the database, and\
  \ will be our go-to guys and gals for all things Pathfinder Society. Keep in mind\
  \ these are very limited and likely to fill up in the first hour after the blog\
  \ goes live.</p> \n    <p>Finally, I need volunteers who have experience with the\
  \ Pathfinder Adventure Card Game, to run demos in the Dealer Hall next to Paizo's\
  \ booth, as well as assist Card Game OP tables in the Sagamore Ballroom, from 8:00\
  \ AM until midnight Thursday through Saturday, and from 9:00 AM until 2:00 PM on\
  \ Sunday. You can volunteer to work 1 or 2 five-hour blocks each day from 9:00 AM\
  \ to 6:00 PM (Sunday ends at 4:00 PM) in the Dealer Hall. Volunteering for any demo\
  \ time will count toward your GM reward credit below, but you still must have a\
  \ minimum of 7 five-hour sessions to qualify for a hotel room as a Tier 2 volunteer.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Below you will find the reward structure for volunteering at Gen Con\
  \ 2015. Keep in mind that you're volunteering for slots, not a specific event. Those\
  \ that are able to spice up their event by adding 3-D terrain, props that stand\
  \ out and the like, will be given first consideration for specific events. I will\
  \ let you know the slots and scenarios you have been assigned as soon as possible.\
  \ You may designate what tier scenarios you wish to GM but this is not guaranteed\
  \ to be filled. I will do the best I can to accommodate your requests. My target\
  \ date to have all GMs their assigned schedules is April 3. This should allow you\
  \ plenty of time to plan a schedule, before the May event registration, with your\
  \ friends and family who are also attending Gen Con 2015. Please let me know via\
  \ email which days you will be at the convention and how many slots you are volunteering\
  \ for at Gen Con 2015.</p> \n    <h3>Volunteer Reward Tiers</h3> \n    <blockquote>\

  \     </ul> \n    </blockquote> \n    <h3>When Volunteering...</h3> \n    <p>Again,\
  \ please be specific about what days and how many slots you are volunteering for.\
  \ I will assign folks to slots and scenarios on an as-needed basis. I will update\
  \ this blog as spots fill up.</p> \n    <p>The time slots are as follows:</p> \n\
  \    <blockquote> \n     <p><b>Slot 1:</b> Thursday 8:00 AM to 1:00 PM <b>Slot 2:</b>\
  \ Thursday 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM <b>Slot 3:</b> Thursday 7:00 PM to Midnight (Gen Con\

  \ \"True Dragons of Absalom\") <b>Slot 10:</b> Sunday 9:00 AM to 2:00 PM (Gen Con\
  \ Special \"Serpents Rise\" and assorted tables of various scenarios).</p> \n  \
  \  </blockquote> \n    <h3>HQ Volunteers</h3> \n    <p>HQ Volunteers are involved\
  \ in the management and coordination of Pathfinder Society events at Gen Con. As\
  \ a team, they're responsible for getting all the players and GMs seated, answering\
  \ questions for new players, handing out prizes, and all the minutiae in getting\
  \ 180 tables worth of GMs and players per slot seated and enjoying their games.\
  \ HQ slots are longer than GM slots, and there are only 2 per day (except Sunday,\
  \ when we only have 1) of the convention. Morning slots start half an hour before\
  \ the games start, and the evening slot ends half an hour after the last player\
  \ leaves the room. With few exceptions, every HQ Volunteer needs to be familiar\
  \ with Pathfinder Society and the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, much as a GM is.\
  \ The reward structure is similar to that of GMs, with the Tiers tied to rewards\
  \ for similar amounts of time volunteered.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><b>Tier\
  \ 1 HQ:</b> 5 Slots<br> <b>Tier 2 HQ:</b> N/A<br> <b>Tier 3 HQ:</b> 4 Slots<br>\
  \ <b>Tier 4 HQ:</b> 3 Slots</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>HQ slots are 7:30 AM\
  \ through 3:45 PM for the morning and 3:45 PM through 12:30 AM for the evening.\
  \ If volunteering for an HQ position, please list your skill and strengths in the\
  \ area you want to volunteer for so we can match up a volunteer to the job that\
  \ best fits his or her talents. Rewards are much the same as the GM rewards, as\
  \ follows:</p> \n    <h3>HQ Volunteer Tier Rewards</h3> \n    <blockquote> \n  \
  \   <p><b>Tier 1 HQ Volunteers</b><br> Tier 1 HQ volunteers are the backbone to\

  \ for Paizo over new volunteers. Most of my HQ volunteers fall into this group.\
  \ Please do not volunteer for Tier 1 if you have any doubts about being able to\
  \ attend the show. Tier 1 GMs receive:</p> \n     <ul>\n      <li>A FREE 4-Day Gen\
