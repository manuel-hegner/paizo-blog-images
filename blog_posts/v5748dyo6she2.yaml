  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p>Eando Kline, faction leader\
  \ of the Vigilant Seal, looks up at the orange-streaked faces of two of his junior\
  \ Pathfinders. “Explain.”</p> \n      <p>One gestures to a bucket of clay spheres\
  \ at her feet. “Well, sir, we found these artifacts in dig site 23B-2, and Jaci\
  \ here opened one to survey its contents. They’re inkwells! It turns out that some\
  \ pressure had built up and—”</p> \n      <p>“In the field.”</p> \n      <p>“Yes,\
  \ sir.”</p> \n      <p>“Without checking it for hazards.”</p> \n      <p>“Well…”\
  </p> \n      <p>“We’re in a Cyclopean ruin, surrounded by explosive trees, a Pathfinder’\
  s just gone missing, and you didn’t think to assess them for risk?!” Eando’s voice\
  \ raises slightly, before he rubs the scar over his eye and turns back to the Pathfinders\
  \ with a warmer voice. “I’m just glad that this time, all you got was a face-full\
  \ of old ink, not mind-controlling spores. Seen it before. Now, get going—leave\
  \ those here and I’ll see that they get to their proper place.”</p> \n      <p>There’\
  s a shuffle at the door as the junior Pathfinders scurry out and are replaced by\
  \ a team of Vigilant Seal agents carrying a small chest. “Correspondence from the\
  \ <em>Glorious Payoff</em>, sir.” </p> \n      <p>Eando waits with anticipation\
  \ to hear word from his colleague as his agents pass several magical and alchemical\
  \ tools over the crate, each reacting in turn.</p> \n      <p>“Curses: negative.”\
  </p> \n      <p>“Toxins: negative.”</p> \n      <p>“Volatiles: negative.”</p> \n\
  \      <p>“Auras: negative.”</p> \n      <p>Only once proper procedure has been\
  \ observed does Eando open the chest, revealing maps, journals, and a sealed letter.\
  \ Also revealed is the inscription of a mouth on the underside of the chest’s lid,\
  \ which immediately animates, letting out an extremely loud and extremely off-key\
  \ rendition of Ulfen drinking song “Set Sail with Me to Valenhall” in Calisro Benarry’\
  s voice. Eando flicks a hidden blade into his wrist and scratches out the inscription\
  \ before Calisro’s recording can get to the high part. “I thought you said no auras.”\
  </p> \n      <p>“Apologies, sir, but all Captain Benarry’s correspondence is considered\
  \ pre-cleared for level-two scanning protocols only.”</p> \n      <p>“Please move\
  \ her to level three in the future, her singing warrants at least that level of\
  \ hazard.” Eando unfurls a map from the chest and strokes his beard. “It sounds\
  \ like she and Bjersig should be landing in Arcadia shortly. To think, a lodge on\
  \ the other side of the sea! What I’d give to see this legendary Ulfen settlement\
  \ on the far shores...” Looking around the Cyclopean ruins as Pathfinders excavate\
  \ artifacts and mark dig sites, Eando sighs and shakes his head. He’s right where\
  \ he’s needed—best leave the exploring to the young.</p>\n      <p> </p>\n     \
  \ <p>“Start reloading the chest for a return voyage and include a full report on\
  \ what’s happened here so far. The faction leaders need to know that something’\
  s brewing in Iobaria.” Eando looks at the scratched-out magical inscription on the\
  \ chest, pauses, and picks up one of the clay inkpots left behind, a rare smile\
  \ flickering across his face. “Put one of these in for the captain, as well.”</p>\
