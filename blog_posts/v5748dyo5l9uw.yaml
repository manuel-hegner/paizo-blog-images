  date\">Thursday, February 12, 2009</p> \n   <p>The Paizo office isn't just all about\
  \ the RPGs and trade paperbacksâ€”it's amazing what goes on around here. The other\
  \ day, I came to work early just to participate in Pierce Watter's weekly taijiquan\
  \ lesson. It's a great way to start the day; I learned the qigong warm-up exercises,\
  \ the beginner's pushing hands exercise, and ten ways to kill a man with an eyelash.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Pierce is very knowledgeable about taijiquan (as his 40 years of martial\
  \ arts training, being the founding editor of <i>Internal Arts</i> magazine, and\
  \ multiple magazine articles in <i>Kung Fu</i> magazine will attest), and perhaps\
  \ even more knowledgeable about various Chinese teas. Each day, Pierce prepares\
  \ a pot of tea, and after the lesson he offered me some of his delicious brew (there's\
  \ nothing quite like sharing a pot of tea with Pierce Watters while talking to him\
  \ about Chinese tea culture, taijiquan, or his tenure at TSR).</p> \n   <p>So, with\
  \ my day already off to a great start, there was only one way to top it: work on\
  \ Pathfinder products. I was particularly pleased with this day; David and I completed\
  \ the first two big projects we were assigned, and we gave an editing pass over\
  \ a chapter of the upcoming sourcebook <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy84bb\"><i>Pathfinder\
  \ Chronicles: The Great Beyond, A Guide to the Multiverse</i></a>. (This book is\
  \ going to be great; what we read has David and me very excited to see the rest!)</p>\

  \ ready to call the day a success, go home and get some dinner (I had skipped lunch),\
  \ watch some of <i>The Office,</i> and pass out. Little did I know that there was\
  \ still more awesome headed my way: Sean K Reynolds approached and invited us to\
  \ join him in his weekly after-work session of miniature painting! Even though I\
  \ was starving, I had to check it out. So David and I hopped on over to the meeting\
  \ room where Sean showed us the ropes of this delicate art while assuring us that\
  \ the process is actually quite simple.</p> \n   <p>The really cool part was him\
  \ unveiling a foam case filled with his as-of-yet unpainted miniatures and allowing\
  \ us to choose one, saying with a smile, \"You paint it, you keep it!\" How cool\
  \ is that?! (Incidentally, I chose what looks like a human female rogue, masked\
  \ and hooded and wielding a longsword.) I'm really excited about these sessions,\
  \ even though I still find the task a bit daunting. He says it's easy to learn,\
  \ but then you look at his, and they're seriously works of art.</p> \n   <p>But\
  \ you know what, even if I'm totally horrible (which I'm fairly certain will be\
  \ the case, since I can't even stay in the lines of a coloring book... that's right,\
  \ I color), it will still be a lot of fun. Also, Sean has some very entertaining\
  \ anecdotes of various games he's played in with other famed game designers (which\
  \ kept me there far longer than my growling stomach would have liked). David and\
  \ I decided these stories absolutely need to go up as blogs, and we'll also be posting\
  \ pics of our sloppy attempts at miniature painting once we finish our first ones\
  \ (well, David's might actually be good).</p> \n   <p>Anyway, it was a lot of fun,\
  \ and certainly a great way to bookend what is just another day at the office!</p>\
