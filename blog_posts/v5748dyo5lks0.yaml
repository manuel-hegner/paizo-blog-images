  \ to keep apace of our production schedules, so in recent months we've added a few\
  \ new faces to the development team. Some of you keen-eyed readers might have noticed\
  \ new names in our credits, and now's the time to let them introduce themselves.\
  \ Welcome the newest faces of Paizo!</p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <h2>Eleanor\
  \ Ferron, Developer</h2> \n      <p>Hello! My name is Eleanor Ferron. I just joined\
  \ Paizo back in January as a new developer, and it hasn't quite sunk in for me yet.\
  \ I'm amazed to be a part of this team!</p> \n      <p>I got into tabletop roleplaying\
  \ back when I was ten years old, when my brother started buying RPG books and bringing\
  \ them home. As I was dedicated to my role of annoying younger sibling, I promptly\
  \ stole all of his books when he wasn't home and read through them as well. I wasn't\
  \ able to play until much later in life, but I was fortunate in joining a dedicated\
  \ RPG club, which exposed me to all sorts of RPG systems and styles. In 2015, I\
  \ started freelancing for Paizo, and it's been exhilarating to share my creations\
  \ with the Paizo community.</p> \n      <p>I originally was trying to break into\
  \ the RPG industry as an artist; I've illustrated RPGs such as Short Order Heroes\
  \ and the Queen's Cavaliers. The fact I have now been hired as a Paizo writer is\
  \ a clue to how well that went.</p> \n      <h2>Luis Loza, Developer</h2> \n   \

  \     </div> \n      <p>Hail and well met! My name is Luis Loza and I'm happy to\
  \ be your new developer! I've been playing tabletop RPGs in some form for almost\
  \ 15 years. My first experience with Pathfinder was a random picture I found online\
  \ which featured the cover art of The Skinsaw Murders with a caption proclaiming\
  \ it to be the scariest night your characters would ever have. My interest was piqued\
  \ and I was fully hooked shortly thereafter. I jumped into Pathfinder, fell in love\
  \ with the setting, and never looked back.</p> \n      <p>My first freelancing gig\
  \ with Paizo was writing spells for the Giant Hunter's Handbook and I've done plenty\
  \ more since then! (I keep a list of my credits on my profile page.) I guess Paizo\
  \ liked me enough to bring me on as a developer and I'm excited to get to work!\
  \ (Note: This is actually my second time on the Paizo blog, the first being a random\
  \ picture of me from PaizoCon years back. I told myself I would mention this fact\
  \ if I eventually worked for Paizo, so here's to you, Luis from 2013!)</p> \n  \
  \    <h2 style=\"clear: both;\">Ron Lundeen, Developer</h2> \n      <div class=\"\

  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20180503-Ron_180.jpeg\"></a>\n  \
  \    </div> \n      <p>Adam Daigle didn't believe me when I said I wanted to come\
  \ work for him full time. He knew I had a career as an in-house attorney for a large\
  \ company, but he didn't know that all my freelance writing, freelance developing,\
  \ and blog post authorship was part of a long-ranging scheme to live my dream by\
  \ working at Paizo. My wife, in particular, was more supportive than I deserve when\
  \ I told her I was angling to pursue my dream job. And now I've done it! I've moved\
  \ my family from Chicago (where the winters are cold enough to kill people and the\
  \ summers are hot enough to kill people) to the Pacific Northwest. We were greeted\
  \ with a Christmastime snowfall robust enough to build a snowman with my kids. That's\
  \ a rarity here, I've been told.</p> \n      <p>I've been hurled into the deep end\
  \ of Adventure Path developmentâ€”more specifically, the back end of the Adventure\
  \ Paths, where the articles, gazetteers, new monsters, and \"what's coming next\
  \ month\" all go. I see a lot of variety packed into the backmatter, from articles\
  \ about noble spy networks to flaming ghost monsters to wicked halfling gods. It's\
  \ a rush to see all the goodies Paizo's stellar freelancers have created, and still\
  \ a bit of shock to realize that coordinating and developing it all is my actual\
  \ job now.</p> \n      <p>Everyone at Paizo has been incredibly open and helpful,\
  \ from setting up useful macros to showing me around the cavernous warehouse, and\
  \ from talking about bicycle trails to work to explaining what a \"Fred Meyer\"\
  \ is. I'm thrilled to be with such an energetic and friendly group, and I can't\
  \ wait to bring these wonders to you!</p> \n      <h2>Michael Sayre, Developer</h2>\
  \ \n      <div class=\"blurb180\">\n       <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20180503-Michael.png\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20180503-Michael_180.png\"></a>\n\
  \      </div> \n      <p>Hello! My name is Michael Sayre. Before joining Paizo as\
  \ the new organized play developer, I've worked as a lead designer for Dreamscarred\
  \ Press and Drop Dead Studios, and done freelance design and development for companies\
  \ like Amora Games, Lost Spheres Publishing, and Rogue Genius Games. If you're a\
  \ fan of third-party materials you might recognize my name from projects like Dreamscarred's\
  \ <em>Akashic Mysteries</em>, Drop Dead's Spheres of Might, or Lost Sphere's recent\
  \ <em>City of 7 Seraphs</em> Kickstarter. Working here at Paizo is going to present\
  \ me with some amazing opportunities to help develop and grow the adventures for\
  \ the organized play community and I'm looking forward to helping the team as we\
  \ work on the current and future seasons.</p> \n      <h2>Chris Sims, Developer</h2>\
  \ \n      <div class=\"blurb180\">\n       <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20180503-Chris.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20180503-Chris_180.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \      </div> \n      <p>Life is weird. It's like a strange dream moving along unexpected\
  \ paths. I'm a Starfinder developer now. How did that happen?</p> \n      <p>I knew\
  \ from an early age that I wanted to work in games, but in a massive failure of\
  \ imagination, I didn't ponder the design and development route. I trained as a\
  \ graphic artist, thinking that was my road to a game job. When D&amp;D's third\
  \ edition came out, it revitalized my love of the game. I delved deep, and I reviewed\
  \ d20 products. Owners of a few such products asked me to edit or develop for them.\
  \ I did.</p> \n      <p>Then, Wizards of the Coast issued an open call for freelance\
  \ editors. I answered. The rest is history.</p> \n      <p>For fifteen years, now,\
  \ I've been in games. I've worked on Magic, D&amp;D for the last three editions,\
  \ Pathfinder, and a few digital offerings, including the upcoming State of Decay\
  \ 2 video game. With plenty of ups and downs, I've been a freelancer and an in-house\
  \ contributor. I've had the privilege to know a lot of fine folks in this industry.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>It's to these relationships that I feel I owe many of my past successes\
  \ and my current lucky arrival here on the Paizo Starfinder team. Yeah, I have experience\
  \ and skill, but being a known variable helped, I'm sure.</p> \n      <p>Anyway,\
  \ that's enough history and philosophy. I'm excited to be delving into a new game\
  \ yet again. My work on Starfinder is supposed to focus on Adventure Paths, which\
  \ is right up my alley. Since I started, though, I've been developing and designing\
  \ all kinds of game elements, from hybrid items to aliens, starships to new rules.\
  \ Like an explorer looking for that big find in the Vast, I don't plan on stopping\
  \ anytime soon. And, I can't wait to show you what I discover.</p> \n     </blockquote>\
