  \ <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Our first marathon is in the books,\
  \ and it’s time to report out! We knew when we started <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6si55?The-Abomination-Arsenal\"\
  >this project</a> that it wasn’t going to go down like a typical dungeon crawl—\
  or megadungeon for that matter. Instead, this campaign shot off with an excessively\
  \ violent bang (series of them, actually) that left a character dead and a level\
  \ full of face-down mitflits. We’ve played a lot of dungeons over the years, but\
  \ we’ve never riddled one with ricochet marks. In short: Gunslingers are a great\
  \ time, everyone should try four!</p> \n     <p>When you sign up for an OAD marathon,\
  \ you agree to live in a house with us for a few days, playing about twelve to fourteen\
  \ session hours a day. We take our time, roleplay as much as we can, and take advantage\
  \ of almost every side quest and NPC errand that comes along. Throughout the marathon,\
  \ other members of the Order might show up to cameo as NPCs or fellow gunslingers.\
  \ Rack up enough session hours with us, and you’ll become the newest member of OAD.\
  \ With that, we want to wish a warm welcome to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theamberdie/status/1561885697274953729\"\
  >Karee Vogrin</a>, who reached 100 session hours and membership during this marathon!\
  \ </p> \n     <ul> \n      <li><b>Adventure</b>: <em>Ruins of Gauntlight</em></li>\
  \ \n      <li><b>Marathon Length</b>: 60 hours, 45min</li> \n      <li><b>Session\
  \ Hours</b>: 35hrs, 30min</li> \n     </ul> \n     <p>Our GM started the story on\
  \ the path to the Gauntlight ruins, as we were already well prepped with a session\
  \ zero and the material we had in our campaign’s Google Classroom. We found the\
  \ top level of the ruins occupied, but the Black Powder Cadre was in need of cash,\
  \ so the room-clearing began—right after we picked two of our characters up out\
  \ of the mud. Yup, the Amber Die itself was hot from the start, and Adam opened\
  \ this campaign with three crits from a slurk in the first encounter!</p> \n   \

  \ from <em>Ruins of Gauntlight:</em></h3> \n     <p>□ The Black Powder Cadre isn’\
  t a group known for tact, and we managed to get kicked out of two of Otari’s prominent\
  \ taverns: The Rowdy Rockfish and the Crook’s Nook. At the Rockfish we botched (a\
  \ light term) an attempt to empathize with the proprietor whose son disappeared\
  \ a year ago. At the Crook’s Nook, we ran up a sizeable tab with the local thieves’\
  \ guild. Solving this issue isn’t as simple as merely avoiding the tavern, so we’\
  ll keep you updated as our debt looms. At least they know we’re heavily armed!</p>\
  \ \n     <p>□ When you have a party consisting entirely of gunslingers, adventuring\
  \ tactics can change a bit. We approached almost every room in the ruins through\
  \ its collapsed ceiling. If we saw opposition on the floor below, we rained down\
  \ lead as they scampered for the doors. Let the gods sort ’em out!</p> \n     <p>□\
  \ Hands-down one of the best battles of the adventure took place in the Otari graveyard.\
  \ We raced past the cemetery gates as the Gauntlight shone down its eerie beam,\
  \ bringing the deceased back to life! Things got loud real quick, and not since\
  \ our years of playing <em>Call of Duty: Zombies</em> have we unloaded that much\
  \ firepower into the walking dead. Worse yet, the Gauntlight brought to life our\
  \ former companion, Rome, whose body was wrapped and prepared for a funeral the\
  \ next morning. His massive frame lumbered toward us—and went down like the rest.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>□ Just because we are the only ones with guns does not mean there aren’\
  t some close shootouts. What, you thought you would automatically win a ranged battle\
  \ because you’re packing heat? A morlock with a junk launcher might just have better\
  \ aim.</p> \n     <p>□ Over the years, our GM has been known for rendering maps\
  \ from Pathfinder adventures in his <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo5lj2f?Order-of-the-Amber-Die-The-Strange-Aeons\"\
  >signature style</a>. This time he drew with one eye—not by choice. It’s a long\
  \ story, but Adam even GMed this project launch in sunglasses the whole time. Many\
  \ thanks to the docs at Wills Eye in Philly for helping us pull off this marathon!</p>\

  ></p>\n     </div> \n     <h3>The Arsenal</h3> \n     <p>As expected, with a party\
  \ consisting completely of gunslingers, we saw quite a few extremes play out during\
  \ the first marathon. Foremost, there is little that compares to round one of most\
  \ combats: fire, reload, fire. Round two is rough though, when we all usually reload,\
  \ fire, and reload. Another concern is money, as guns and ammo are expensive for\
  \ an entire adventuring party. That fancy gem we found in the back of the soulbound\
  \ doll? Sold—pass me a cartridge. Additionally, healing is an issue for us. Battle\
  \ Medicine is a key reason we’re still here, and we’re thinking that eventually\
  \ all characters will have to take it. Since we are all playing the same class,\
  \ we’ve been overpowered in some encounters, and barely equipped to handle others;\
  \ most importantly, this campaign is unlike any other, and that’s what we were striving\
  \ for. Like all OAD projects, we’re also tracking data on how the characters interact\
  \ with the Adventure Path, and we’ll present it at the end. </p> \n     <br> \n\
  \     <h3>Character Deaths:</h3> \n     <p>□ Anyone who is familiar with the Abomination\
  \ Vaults has probably heard of Mister Beak, the soulbound doll responsible for so\
  \ many TPKs that it earned a nerf in the hardcover version of the Adventure Path.\
  \ Rome, a gunslinger following the Way of the Drifter, failed his save vs. the doll’\
  s <em>phantom pain</em>. We shot Mister Beak up easier than a clay pigeon, but the\
  \ persistent damage demanded some flat checks for Rome to survive. While he did\
  \ manage to get rid of the persistent damage, he was still dying and needed to make\
  \ recovery checks to stabilize. Our party’s inability to heal our fellow gunslinger\
  \ left us watching in frozen fear: Rome had fallen. Yes, we used the nerfed version\
  \ of the doll. Sorry for putting you out there, Erick!</p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Best\
  \ Quote From Marathon 1:</h3> \n     <p>(with smoke hovering after two-dozen rounds\
  \ fired) </p>\n     <p>Breen: \"Clear?\"<br> Vlai: (kicks a dead gremlin) \"Clear!\"\
  \ <br> Rome: “They shouldn’t have brought darts to a gunfight.”<br> <br> </p>\n\

  ></p>\n     </div> \n     <h3>Current Situation:</h3> \n     <p>Gotta be honest,\
  \ we loved the town of Otari as much as we did the first two levels of the Abomination\
  \ Vaults. We had dinner with the mayor, read suggested selections at the Dawnflower\
  \ Library, and even acquired the deed for the ruins of The Thirsty Alpaca. As of\
  \ now, a crooked sign stands in front of the old alpaca that reads “Coming soon:\
  \ Maloika’s Mercantile.” We’ve mourned our single character death, and Rome has\
  \ been replaced by a rookie gunslinger from Arcadia practicing the Way of the Spellshot.\
  \ We also explored level one and part of level two of the megadungeon, found Otari’\
  s ghost, and followed it as best we could to level three. We’re currently in a hallway\
  \ that presents a bit of option-anxiety: two stairways headed up, an open room with\
  \ mist to the left, and a door at the other end of the corridor. Lock and load!</p>\
