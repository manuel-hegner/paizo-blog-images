  \ \n     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Meleeka drops into a ready\
  \ stance. Legs spread slightly more than shoulder-width apart, left knee touching\
  \ the ground, the ball of her right foot raised and poised to launch her in any\
  \ direction at a moment’s notice. She begins slowly sweeping her arms in broad,\
  \ circular movements, fingers curled like grasping talons as she channels her rage\
  \ and negative emotions out of her body, giving them shape as flickering flames\
  \ shrouding her hands.</p> \n      <p>The soft clap from outside the training area\
  \ is all the signal she needs. Meleeka launches herself off her right foot, throwing\
  \ her body into a twisting spin to add momentum to her first blow, shattering a\
  \ wooden training dummy into shards of smoking wood. Landing on her left foot, she\
  \ kicks off the ground immediately, throwing herself into a backflip that takes\
  \ her over the next nearest training dummy. Coiling her hands together into a hammer\
  \ of fire, she reduces that target to shards as well. Eyeing the last target, a\
  \ stone statue known to the initiated as One-Who-Waits, Meleeka charges forward,\
  \ flames shrouding her feet and giving her extra momentum for her final leap. Arms\
  \ outstretched, body turning from a vertical whirl to a horizontal spin, she latches\
  \ onto the statue with her fingers, using her strength and momentum to sweep the\
  \ heavy stone off the ground, overhead, and bringing it crashing back down in a\
  \ fiery explosion.</p> \n      <p>Looking at the wreckage, Meleeka is surprised\
  \ to find that, unlike a few months previously, the fires had not stoked the anger\
  \ in her heart, but consumed it, leaving her with a relaxed sense of peace that\
  \ was entirely unfamiliar to the young and very talented martial artist.</p> \n\
  \      <p>“You are ready.” The words come from one Rashmivati Melipdra, a jovial\
  \ but imposing woman who had taken Meleeka under her wing, untwisting the young\
  \ woman’s spirit while teaching her discipline and friendship. “You may not see\
  \ it, but I do. I have no need for an apprentice who has learned all I have to teach.”\
  \ Rashmivati says the words with an empathetic smile, her pride in her protégé plainly\
  \ written on her face. “The rest of what you have to learn, you must learn for yourself.”\
  </p> \n      <p>“Where shall I go?” Meleeka asks.</p> \n      <p>“Absalom first,”\
  \ Rashmivati replies. “You should meet Ambrus, and Sorrina, and all the rest. In\
  \ the Grand Lodge, you will encounter many people who see the world through eyes\
  \ different from your own. Learn from them, and let their wisdom show you the next\
  \ path in your journey.” Rashmivati pauses for a moment in pleasant reflection before\
  \ continuing. “And tell my brother Shristi that it has been too long since he last\
  \ visited home. Tell him he is missed, and that I trained you as a disciple. He\
  \ may have more to teach you!” Rashmivati takes the young woman in a hug as she\
  \ finishes. Meleeka’s body stiffens for a moment, still unused to Rashmivati’s displays\
  \ of affection, before melting into the older woman’s arms.</p> \n      <p>“What\
  \ shall I do?” Meleeka whispers into the silken scarves covering her mentor’s shoulders.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>“Whatever you wish my child. Go, and make this world your own.”</p>\

  \   </div> \n     <p>Hey everyone, Michael Sayre here! It’s with a mixture of sadness\
  \ and excitement that I announce my departure from the Organized Play team. I’ve\
  \ accepted a new position here at Paizo that will take my career in a direction\
  \ I’ve always wanted to go and I’m excited about this new opportunity. But I will\
  \ miss planning, outlining, and developing these adventures that we’ve all shared\
  \ over the last two years! I’ve learned a lot from Linda, Tonya, John, Thursty,\
  \ James, Alex, and everyone else who’s been a part of the Organized Play family\
  \ during my time in this department. But don’t worry! I’m leaving you all in excellent\
  \ hands, and Linda will be following up in a bit to let you know about the rest\
  \ of the changes to the team.</p> \n     <p>Thanks so much for allowing me to be\
  \ part of this community, and hopefully I still have many more opportunities to\
  \ join you all at a table in the years to come. You’re all awesome. And just in\
  \ case this is the last time I get to say it…</p> \n     <p>Explore! Report! Cooperate!</p>\
