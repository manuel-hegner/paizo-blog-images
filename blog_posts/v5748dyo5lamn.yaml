  date\">Thursday, November 19, 2009</p> \n   <p class=\"tiny\">*Sort of.</p> \n \
  \  <p>Beginning today, I am opening the door to the <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety\"\
  >Pathfinder Society Organized Play</a> open call not for a week but for a long,\
  \ unspecified length of time. I am looking for three specific types of adventures\
  \ (detailed below) for <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety\">Pathfinder Society</a>. I\
  \ am NOT seeking generic Pathfinder RPG adventures nor am I asking you to pitch\
  \ me a new Pathfinder Adventure Path. Any submissions that aren't specifically for\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety\">Pathfinder Society Organized Play</a> scenarios\
  \ will be ignored.</p> \n   <p>Instead of asking you to send me a 750-word outline,\
  \ I'm asking you to send completed adventures. A completed adventure cannot exceed\
  \ 12,000 words and must (MUST!) follow the style for a Pathfinder Society Organized\
  \ Play adventure scenario as established by the <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/scenarios/season1\"\
  >Season 1 scenarios</a>. Those of you not brave enough to send a completed adventure\
  \ can instead send me a short (less than 500 words) query instead that quickly describes\
  \ the adventure. I will review completed adventures and queries as I receive them\
  \ and respond appropriately. If I receive one that I like (especially if I receive\
  \ a completed adventure that I like), I will likely give that author a contract\
  \ and pay him or her for the adventure. If I receive one that I 80% like, I will\
  \ likely ask that author to rewrite elements and resubmit for possible future publication.\
  \ There is no guarantee at any point in this process that I will give you a contract\
  \ and pay you for your work.</p> \n   <p>By making the opening the open call for\
  \ a longer period of time, I hope to see an increase in the quality and volume of\
  \ submissions. Paizo uses the Pathfinder Society Organized Play open calls to find\
  \ new talent for our other product lines—maybe that new talent is you!</p> \n  \
  \ <p>And now for some rules:</p> \n   <p><b>Rules of Submitting for the Pathfinder\
  \ Society Organized Play Open Call</b></p>\n   <blockquote> \n    <p>1. Only submit\
  \ Pathfinder Society scenarios or scenario ideas. I won't even respond to other\
  \ queries.</p> \n    <p>2. If you submit a complete 12,000-word adventure, you must\
  \ include a scan of <a href=\"/download/pathfinder/PaizoPublishing_Submission_Agreement.zip\"\
  >this PDF</a> with your signature on it with your submission. If your submission\
  \ lacks this PDF, it will be rejected without being read. The PDF is NOT necessary\
  \ for 500-word queries.</p> \n    <p>3. All submissions must be made via email to\
  \ <b>pathfindersociety@paizo.com</b>. </p> \n    <p>4. Your submission must be in\
  \ .doc, .rtf, or .txt format. </p> \n    <p>5. Your submission must include your\
  \ full legal name, physical mailing address, email address, and a contact phone\
  \ number on the top of the first page. This does not count toward word count.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>6. Your submission file (not the agreement PDF) must be named LASTNAME_TITLE.EXTENSION\
  \ such as FROST_AMONGSTTHELIVING.doc.</p> \n    <p>7. The subject line of your submission\
  \ email must be labeled the same: LASTNAME TITLE.</p> \n    <p>8. Allow 72 hours\
  \ for a response before resubmitting. Allow for more time on a holiday weekend.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>9. Read at least one <a href=\"http://paizo.com/pathfinderSociety/scenarios/season1\"\
  >season 1 scenario</a> (you probably want to read all of them) before submitting.\
  \ I can usually tell in about the first 50 words if you've actually read or played\
  \ in a scenario. </p> \n    <p>10. Failure to follow any of the above rules will\
  \ result in a rejection.</p> \n   </blockquote>\n   <p></p> \n   <p><b>General Guidelines</b></p>\n\
  \   <blockquote>\n     Here are a few tips for your scenarios or scenario ideas:\n\
  \    <br> \n    <p>1. Use our setting details to make your own story, don't cram\
  \ your story so full of our canon that it reads like a Frankenstein's monster of\
  \ other authors' work. Read <a href=\"/paizo/messageboards/paizoPublishing/pathfinder/pathfinderSociety/scenarioSubmissionTalk/pFSS45&amp;page=1#15\"\
  >this post</a> for an example.</p> \n    <p>2. Understand that Pathfinder Society\
  \ is not a good-aligned organization, nor is it evil. Also understand that evil\
  \ characters are not allowed in Pathfinder Society Organized Play. Also understand\
  \ that all scenarios must be PG-13.</p> \n    <p>3. Avoid child endangerment stories.\
  \ It's cheap, it's trite, and I'm tired of reading them.</p> \n    <p>4. Not really\
  \ looking for comedies.</p> \n    <p>5. I am really looking for high adventure stories\
  \ with drama, action, and roleplay.</p> \n    <p>6. Speaking of roleplay, I'd love\
  \ for someone to knock me dead with a good murder mystery scenario. And I mean really\
  \ good in the sense that after 4 hours of game play at a convention every class\
  \ of player walks away from the table satisfied. Tall order, I know, but I'd love\
  \ to see it happen.</p> \n    <p>7. #5 and #6 do not mean that all I want to see\
  \ are high adventure stories and murder mysteries. If you have a really good idea\
  \ that's neither of those two, I want to see it.</p> \n    <p>8. Only send me your\
  \ best ideas and your (very important) BEST-WRITTEN ideas. You may send more than\
  \ one idea.</p> \n    <p>9. NO EASTER EGGS. What I mean by that is this: don't be\
  \ cute and include a reference to your favorite comic book/movie/song/etc. If we\
  \ catch it, you're done. If we don't catch it, we could get the pants sued off of\
  \ us. Just don't do it.</p> \n    <p>10. Passive voice is a rejection in the making.\

  \ Society is Currently Seeking</b></p>\n   <blockquote>\n     We need the following\
  \ adventure submissions for Pathfinder Society Organized Play:\n    <br> \n    <p>1.\
  \ Tier 1–5 scenario set in Absalom.</p> \n    <p>2. Tier 1–5 scenario set in Qadira.</p>\
