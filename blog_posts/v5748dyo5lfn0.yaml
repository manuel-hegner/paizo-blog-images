  >We're about a month away from the official January release date of the <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy91pu\">Wrath of the Righteous</a> set of 55 prepainted <a href=\"\
  /pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids\">Pathfinder Battles</a> miniatures, and\
  \ I've got to tell you—I am starting to get seriously psyched. This week WizKids\
  \ stopped by the Paizo offices to deliver the first brick of sealed boosters for\
  \ the <a href=\"/products/btpy91pu\">Wrath of the Righteous</a> set, and I'm happy\
  \ to say that the quality on the final figures is phenomenal.</span></p> \n    <p>Although\
  \ we love all of our children equally, it's fair to say that there were some paint\
  \ deco struggles on the last set, <a href=\"/products/btpy909j\">Legends of Golarion</a>.\
  \ Reports of questionable paint jobs on that set started coming through just as\
  \ this one was going into production, and we were able to take some steps to prevent\
  \ some of the issues that crept in last time. Most significantly, we've simplified\
  \ the paint masters, often in extremely subtle ways, to make it easier for the factory\
  \ to apply the paint in the time allotted. <a href=\"/products/btpy91pu\">Wrath\
  \ of the Righteous</a> features less complex color blends, more judicious use of\
  \ inks, and less fetishism for painting every single buckle on every single figure.\
  \ While it might seem like that's a step backward, in practice the final figures\
  \ are less sloppy and much better executed. I think everyone will really appreciate\
  \ the new approach.</p> \n    <p>These photos, and indeed all of the photos we've\
  \ shown for this set so far, are under the new paradigm, so if you like what you've\
  \ been seeing here, chances are very, very high that you'll love the final production\
  \ figures.</p> \n    <p>By the way, did you know that this set includes a very large\
  \ number of demons? We've already previewed several, but this week I wanted to reveal\
  \ five more. Here we go!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71408_AbrikandiluDemon_500.jpeg\"\
  > <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71408_AbrikandiluDemon_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Known as “wrecker demons,” Abrikandilu\
  \ Demons delight in destroying beauty, be it the rending of a fine painting to shreds,\
  \ reducing a magnificent statue to rubble, or scarring a lovely face. This fine\
  \ gentleman here is depicted defacing a beautiful book (the <a href=\"/products/btpy88yj\"\
  >Core Rulebook</a>, perhaps?). Abrikandilus are formed from the tortured souls of\
  \ vandals and mortals who destroyed beauty out of jealousy. They often serve as\
  \ ground troops in Abyssal armies, and appear somewhat frequently in the <a href=\"\
  /pathfinder/adventurePath/wrathOfTheRighteous\">Wrath of the Righteous Adventure\
  \ Path</a>. The Abrikandilu Demon is a Medium figure slated at the common rarity.\
  \ Its statistics can be found on page 42 of <a href=\"/products/btpy8yvk\">Pathfinder\
  \ Campaign Setting: The Worldwound</a>.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a\
  \ href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71408_InvidiakDemon_500.jpeg\"> <img\

  0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>The vile Invidiaks dwell in the deepest shadows,\
  \ always looking for mortals to possess. The incorporeal creatures thrive in darkness,\
  \ blending perfectly into their shadowy surroundings to spring shuddering surprises\
  \ on their prey. Molded in clear plastic shaded in dark tones, this Medium figure\
  \ is slated at the common rarity. Its statistics can be found on page 67 of the\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy8auu\">Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</a>.</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  \ already gave us the <a href=\"/products/btpy92jp\">Greater Death Demon</a>, one\
  \ of the most beloved figures in that set. Now we present the lesser version, simply\
  \ called the Death Demon. I don't know what else to say about this figure other\
  \ than that I love it like a child. It makes the perfect companion to its cousin.\
  \ The Death Demon is a (somewhat large) Medium creature, and is slated at the uncommon\
  \ rarity. It appears under a different name on page 64 of the <a href=\"/products/btpy8auu\"\
  >Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</a>.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71408_Faxon_500.jpeg\"\

  0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Faxon here isn't technically a demon, but there's\
  \ no question that he has demons roosting somewhere in his family tree. This tiefling\
  \ witch plays an important role in the very first <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/wrathOfTheRighteous\"\
  >Wrath of the Righteous</a> adventure, <a href=\"/products/btpy90q9\">The Worldwound\
  \ Incursion</a>. He's got an amazing sculpt, and though you can't see it on the\
  \ paint master photograph, he's also got a cool demonic sigil on his chest. Faxon\
  \ is a Medium figure slated at the rare rarity.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71408_Khorramzadah_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Last up today is one of the most important villains\
  \ of the entire campaign, the mighty fire demon Khorramzadeh! The leader of the\
  \ Worldwound armies and the most powerful of the true demons that serve the demon\
  \ lord Deskari, Khorramzadeh the Storm King rules over the ruins of the city of\
  \ Iz, at the heart of the Worldwound. I know some of you will be saying “But Erik,\
  \ there was already a fire demon in <a href=\"/products/btpy909j\">Legends of Golarion</a>!”\
  \ True, says I, but this one is even BIGGER and even AWESOMER. And I hate to tell\
  \ your player characters, but you're going to need several fire demons to pull off\
  \ the campaign appropriately. As befitting his status, this quite Large figure is\
  \ slated at the rare rarity.</p> \n    <p>PHEW! That's mostly it for demons in this\
  \ set, though there are a few more yet to be revealed. What else is coming up? More\
  \ good guys, more disgusting monsters, and the figure that gets my vote for the\
  \ coolest mini we've done so far, a creature whose audacity as a sculpt rivals the\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy8v0b\">Shattered Star</a>'s <a href=\"/products/btpy8wtb\"\
  >Clockwork Reliquary</a>. I get shudders just thinking about how great it is. Soon\
  \ you too will behold it in all its glory.</p> \n    <p>Just not quite yet.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Until next week, I remain…</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p>\
