  \ Dueling Writers of Mars!</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, November 4, 2008</p>\
  \ \n   <p>The first manuscript I had an opportunity to read after being welcomed\
  \ aboard the Planet Stories staff was Otis Adelbert Kline's <a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy80hr\"\
  ><i>The Swordsman of Mars</i></a>. As a lifelong Edgar Rice Burroughs enthusiast\
  \ I had, of course, heard about Kline and the long-standing notion among Burroughs's\
  \ readers that the two men, Kline and Burroughs, considered themselves bitter rivals.\
  \ Kline's Venus series is generally recognized as having been penned in the style\
  \ of Burroughs's Mars (or Barsoom) books, and so the story goes that Burroughs launched\
  \ his own Venus series to impart some kind of retribution against his popular imitator.\
  \ The notion of a Burroughs-Kline feud, however, bears little evidence to support\
  \ it, but even so, I must admit it was with some skepticism that I picked up <a\
  \ href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy80hr\"><i>The Swordsman of Mars</i></a> and began\
  \ to read it. After all, there's little doubt in my mind that fate would never have\
  \ led me to a job at Planet Stories if as a kid I had never read ERB, the author\
  \ who ignited my interest in reading and writing, and by a long and tangled path,\
  \ editing. Above all, Burroughs is an incomparable Storyteller, capital S, and his\
  \ works have never gone out of print in the 97 years since he published the serialization\
  \ of his first novel, <i>Under the Moons of Mars</i> (later retitled <i>A Princess\
  \ of Mars</i>), in <i>All-Story Magazine</i>—the same novel that introduced me to\
  \ ERB and got me permanently hooked. When I was in my teens, I <i>devoured</i> ERB's\
  \ works—systematically, ruthlessly, obsessively—racing first across the dead sea\
  \ bottoms of Barsoom with John Carter, then on to the lands that time forgot of\
  \ Caspak and Pellucidar, touring savage jungles and lost cities with Lord Greystoke,\
  \ flying through the shrouded skies of Amtor (Venus) with Carson Napier, and reveling\
  \ in the adventure and romance of every one of Burroughs's many standalone novels.\
  \ How could Kline possibly measure up to that? It was such a game of expectations\
  \ that kept me from reading Kline for all these years in the first place.</p> \n\
  \   <p>I was in for a heck of a surprise. What I found when I finally pored over\
  \ <a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy80hr\"><i>The Swordsman of Mars</i></a> was\
  \ that Otis Adelbert Kline <i>knew</i> his ERB. In particular, he knew ERB's Mars\
  \ books. He had an almost uncanny knack for creating Barsoomian-sounding names and\
  \ terminology—Sheb Takkor, Sel Han, Lal Vak, Kov Lutas, Rad, Jen, Dixtar—and his\
  \ descriptions of exotic settings, such as \"the glittering, frost-covered jungles\"\
  \ of the Takkor Marsh or the dark pits of the Martian baridium mines, are on par\
  \ with ERB's own. Kline was apparently so well studied in his Burroughs that some\
  \ fans have gone so far as to conjecture that <a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy80hr\"\
  ><i>The Swordsman of Mars</i></a> and its sequel <i>The Outlaws of Mars</i> (a forthcoming\
  \ Planet Stories release) take place on some remote corner of ERB's own Barsoom!</p>\
  \ \n   <p>But much more important than the literary artifices he employs, Kline\
  \ understood the mechanics of <i>story</i> on the same instinctive level as Burroughs.\
  \ For with both authors, it's all about the romance and adventure, pulling the reader\
  \ in to the point where the distinction between reader and hero begins to blur—\
  and that's where Kline (and Burroughs) grabs you. For at that point of identification,\
  \ as the hero at last gets within fingertip-reach of the ultimate goal, the conditions\
  \ shift unexpectedly. The hero suddenly finds that what had seemed a simple outcome\
  \ of success or failure is instead a head-swirling, heart-wracking turn of events\
  \ that leaves you racing to the next page to find out how the author can possibly\
  \ maneuver out of what is seemingly the ultimate inextricable dilemma.</p> \n  \
  \ <p>And that's why Otis Adelbert Kline deserves his place in history—like Burroughs\
  \ he is a Storyteller who, on a primal level, has the ability to mesmerize his audience\
  \ with a captivating tale of honor and betrayal. A pulp writer, yes, but one with\
  \ a rare gift of the bards of ancient days, whose simple words enchant and bring\
  \ to life the archetypes that lie in wait in the imagination. Readers of Burroughs\
  \ should love <a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy80hr\"><i>The Swordsman of Mars</i></a>.\
  \ I know this one did.</p> \n   <p>Christopher Carey<br> <i>Planet Stories</i> Editor</p>\
