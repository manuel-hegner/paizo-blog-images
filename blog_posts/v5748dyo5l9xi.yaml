  \ By Their Covers</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Friday, September 26, 2008</p> \n\
  \   <p>Over the last year or so, we've been listening carefully to what people have\
  \ to say about <a href=\"/planetstories\">Planet Stories</a>, and especially about\
  \ the books' covers. While we all know that it's what's inside that counts—and with\
  \ authors like Brackett and Howard, Moore and Moorcock, I think we're pretty set\
  \ on that level—the cover remains the single most important factor in selling a\
  \ book to somebody who may never have heard of it. I know that, especially as a\
  \ child, covers often made my buying decisions for me. Did it have bright colors?\
  \ A dragon on it? What about a weird alien landscape? My favorite science fiction\
  \ novel of all time, Dan Simmons's <i>Hyperion</i>, I purchased based solely on\
  \ the amazing cover, and it's my sincere hope that someone can someday say the same\
  \ thing about one of our books.</p> \n   <p>But finding the right mix with covers\
  \ isn't always easy. Should it be pulpy or sophisticated? Detailed and realistic\
  \ or painterly and stylized? All of us at Planet Stories have our own personal tastes,\
  \ but we're a relatively small sample, and as such we've been spending a lot of\
  \ time on <a href=\"/paizo/messageboards/paizoPublishing/planetStories/general\"\
  >the Planet Stories messageboards</a> getting reader feedback. Lately, it seems\
  \ that we've really hit our stride, with the <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy80hr\"><i>Swordsman\
  \ of Mars</i></a> cover and this fabulous <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy81tw\"><i>Hounds\
  \ of Skaith</i></a> art from our old friend James Ryman being the hands-down favorites\
  \ to date.</p> \n   <p>So what do you think? What do <i>you</i> look for in a science\
  \ fiction or fantasy cover? <a href=\"/paizo/messageboards/paizoPublishing/planetStories/general\"\
  >Click on over to the messageboards</a> and let us know.</p> \n   <p>Believe me,\
  \ we're listening.</p> \n   <p> James Sutter <br> <i>Planet Stories</i> Editor</p>\
