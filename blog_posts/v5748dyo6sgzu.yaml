  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">“Reality\
  \ is born. Reality must die. So somewhere in between must dwell both you and I.”\
  </p> \n     <p>Such was said to be writ upon the Seal, carved in such a way that\
  \ all would understand regardless of language or intellect. The Seal was the gravestone\
  \ of the previous reality. The Seal was the foundation stone of the next reality.\
  \ It was upon the Seal that Pharasma was born into this reality, adrift in the Maelstrom\
  \ within an unformed metacosmos. She stood, and read the Seal’s Truth, and saw that\
  \ she trod upon its core. Looking out over the Seal’s eight edges, Pharasma beheld\
  \ the eternity of probability, a vastness yet formed from the raw entropy of the\
  \ churning remains of what had come before. She was the Survivor, yet she knew not\
  \ what she had survived—just that she had.</p> \n     <p>Pharasma stepped off the\
  \ edge of the Seal, and as her foot descended to the nothing, the Seal expanded\
  \ so that she was supported. She stood there a moment on one of the Seal’s eight\
  \ edges, one step into the new reality, and she could sense that she was already\
  \ not alone. Something chewed and gnawed out there beyond perception. Something\
  \ vast, and hungry, and dangerous. Pharasma knew her first fear that very first\
  \ step—fear of the unknown, fear that something else had survived, fear that she\
  \ would not.</p> \n     <p>And so she stepped to the side.</p> \n     <p>As Pharasma\
  \ walked, the edges of the Seal grew. The Outer Sphere bloomed beneath her feet\
  \ as the Seal expanded its power. Where Pharasma walked, the planes themselves followed,\
  \ and with each circuit around the Seal, she widened her path, walking a deosil\
  \ spiral of creation that gave those who would follow a place to love and hate,\
  \ to war and create. As she walked the spiral, the Seal itself grew outward, forming\
  \ the Spire. It reached toward what lay opposite its beginning. And when Pharasma\
  \ finished, the Spire had grown to support the Boneyard above, and it would be her\
  \ home.</p> \n     <p>The Seal had responded to Pharasma’s spiral path, and as she\
  \ strode, other divinities were birthed into the new reality. The Speakers in the\
  \ Depths retreated at once to the heart of entropy and could not be bothered to\
  \ take part in what followed. Desna marveled at creation, and with a wave of her\
  \ hand brought the first night to the skies above. Sarenrae followed swiftly thereafter,\
  \ and was smitten with Desna and her work, and so she chose the brightest of those\
  \ stars to shine as the suns, birthing the first day. Ihys, who would in time become\
  \ the First to die, and his brother Asmodeus, who would in time become the First\
  \ to kill, each defined the other and brought goodness and evil with them. And Achaekek\
  \ rose to stand between, an arbiter over morality and a judge whose impartial aegis\
  \ would, in time, crumble to savagery. Yet not all of the first would have names,\
  \ or even be remembered. One tread forth beyond the Eclipse, but without death yet\
  \ in the world, this Prince became Bound to a throne in the Spire’s shadow to await\
  \ his time. And the final would foolishly step forth beyond Pharasma’s first fearful\
  \ step, and in so doing would be transformed and absorbed by that fear. Whether\
  \ that fear became Rovagug or whether it was Rovagug who was the devouring fear,\
  \ not even the gods can remember.</p> \n     <p>As those First Eight became, so\
  \ did Pharasma feel something else wake on the far side of time. Just as she had\
  \ walked a deosil spiral to create, a widdershins spiral wound in opposition at\
  \ the other side of reality, where the Lurker at the Threshold formed the second\
  \ anchor of creation. Pharasma thus learned that each cycle required not only a\
  \ Survivor, but also a Watcher. So that between the two, between Pharasma and Yog-Sothoth,\
  \ all reality would thus become the Great Beyond. Thus began the Age of Creation.</p>\

  \    </div> \n     <p>And so in the ages that followed, Pharasma remained upon her\
  \ throne. She watched and judged all who passed from life into death, and as time\
  \ wore on the number of the dead grew apace to the number of the born. And in time,\
  \ Pharasma beheld her second fear. An event beyond anticipation fractured fate,\
  \ and on all worlds, the flow of prophecy was forever altered. Storms raged, empires\
  \ fell, gods died, and in the least fortunate corners of reality, entire worlds\
  \ came to an end. Pharasma herself lost track for that brief moment of what had\
  \ yet to come, and when she opened her eyes again, she saw that the Seal had vanished,\
  \ leaving behind a featureless void. She reached out to the Watcher to inquire if\
  \ such a ripple in destiny had ever occurred before, to determine if the loss of\
  \ the Seal had always been ordained, but the Watcher would not reply.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>Yet reality went on. Mortals were born, and mortals were slain. Pharasma’\
  s second fear abated, and she realized that the lost Seal was not an ill omen, but\
  \ more akin to the passing of a parent or teacher. Now, this cycle of reality had\
  \ matured to the point where it could continue on its own, and Pharasma knew that,\
  \ going forward, reality was well and truly on its own. The apogee of creation had\
  \ passed, and Pharasma knew that her days ahead would forever be in the shadow of\
  \ her days behind. And while she knew how much time remained, she knew as well that\
  \ there was more than enough for mortal life to enjoy more glories and triumphs\
  \ than they could envision.</p> \n     <p>And even though reality must eventually\
  \ end, Pharasma does not despair. She knows that the number of the dead has never\
  \ before eclipsed the number of the born, for even as the Watcher witnesses from\
  \ outside the cycle, there must always be a Survivor to carry on within the cycle\
  \ to begin the next. In time, the flux of the born shall cease, and their number\
  \ shall become a static record. And in those final hours, Pharasma knows she must\
  \ prepare the next cycle’s Seal, and she must watch and wait as the final count\
  \ of the dead approaches. And when that final visitant from life steps before her\
  \ throne to be judged, Pharasma knows that it will be the Survivor who stands before\
  \ her, and that she will not judge but will herself be judged. And so, with her\
  \ death, shall this cycle end.</p> \n     <p>But it is here that Pharasma’s final\
  \ fear awaits. The fracture of fate and the loss of the Seal has made her conviction\
  \ falter, and she no longer knows for fact that she shall be the penultimate death.\
  \ For if she steps before herself to be judged, and leaves behind none to Survive,\
  \ the cycle shall end and nothing shall wend.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p style=\"\
  font-weight: bold; line-height: 14px\">About the Author</p> \n    <p>James Jacobs\
  \ is the Creative Director for Pathfinder. While he was there at the beginning of\
  \ Golarion’s creation, many of the deities worshiped by that world’s heroes and\
  \ villains had already existed for decades before. Goddesses and gods like Desna\
  \ and Rovagug, Sarenrae and Abadar, Achaekek and Zon-Kuthon first established their\
  \ faithful among PCs and NPCs alike in James’ home campaign in the late 80s and\
  \ early 90s. Sharing them with the world as deities of the Pathfinder setting, seeing\
  \ players and creators come to love and hate them (and in some cases cosplay as\
  \ them), has been a career highlight.</p> \n    <p style=\"font-weight: bold; line-height:\
  \ 14px\">About the Windsong Testaments</p> \n    <p>On the northern reaches of Varisia’\
  s Lost Coast stands Windsong Abbey, a forum for interfaith discussion tended by\
  \ priests of nearly twenty faiths and led by a legacy of Masked Abbesses. At the\
  \ dawn of the Age of Lost Omens, Windsong Abbey suffered as its faithful fought\
  \ and fled, but today it has begun to recover. A new Masked Abbess guides a new\
  \ flock within, and the <i>Windsong Testaments</i>—parables about the gods themselves—\
  are once again being recorded within the abbey’s walls. Some of these Testaments\
  \ are presented here as Golarion’s myths and fables. Some parts may be true. Other\
  \ parts are certainly false. Which ones are which is left to the faithful to decide.</p>\
