  description\">Throughout these articles on Pathfinder Adventure Card Game tactics,\
  \ we've touched on a lot of important subjects. Now we come to the subject that\
  \ matters the most in most games: finding and fighting the villains. Villains are\
  \ a special type of bane, and they require very special consideration. Beating the\
  \ villain at the right time is how you win, after all, but facing the villain at\
  \ the wrong time can cost you dearly.</p> \n    <h2>Do what you can to isolate the\
  \ villain</h2> \n    <p>Often, you'll just stumble into the villain. However, you\
  \ should also do your best to spot him in advance with Auguries, Spyglasses, oracular\
  \ seeings, and any other means you can devise. Use these scouting powers as much\
  \ as you can; after you find the villain, leave him alone until you're ready to\
  \ face him.</p> \n    <p><i>Corollary #1: Use evasion as a detection technique.</i>\
  \ Evading a villain after stumbling upon him is a great strategy. Merisiel excels\
  \ at this, but several spells help with this type of painless discovery.</p> \n\
  \    <p><i>Corollary #2: After you find the villain, try to position him in his\
  \ deck.</i> Once you've discovered where a villain is, organize his deck if you\
  \ can; this is particularly helpful if he's near the bottom. Have Seelah remove\
  \ boons that are on top of the villain. If you know he's low in the deck, just losing\
  \ to a monster can shuffle the deck and maybe bring the villain up higher. If he's\
  \ near the top, use a Magic Spyglass to make him the first card; if he's at the\
  \ bottom, use Brodert Quink to move him up a little.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ></a> \n     <p>Shifting the villain up even a couple spots can be the difference\
  \ between winning and losing.</p> \n    </div> \n    <h2>If you're not ready to\
  \ win the game, don't worry about temp closes</h2> \n    <p>You may encounter the\
  \ villain before you're ready to win. Perhaps you haven't permanently closed two\
  \ locations, perhaps you haven't stationed characters at all the remaining locations,\
  \ or perhaps you just have poor odds to win the fight. In this case, you shouldn't\
  \ worry too much about temporarily closing locations.</p> \n    <p>Yes, it's always\
  \ better to temporarily close what you easily can. That way there will be fewer\
  \ places for the villain to escape to, and in the worst case, if you lose a fight\
  \ with the villain, you'll lose fewer turns from the blessings deck. So, you might\
  \ want to expend a <i>little</i> effort on temporary closing locations. But you\
  \ probably won't want to expend too many blessings or to pay other notable costs.</p>\
  \ \n    <p><i>Corollary #1: Consider the value of blessings.</i> A blessing on the\
  \ blessings deck is worth a turn, while a blessing in your hand is generally worth\
  \ one exploration. Since a well-played turn will usually encompass multiple explorations,\
  \ that means a blessing on the blessings deck is worth <i>at least</i> as much as\
  \ a blessing from your hand. And the more capable you are of making multiple explorations\
  \ in each future turn (not counting any resources you'll spend to temp close), the\
  \ more it's worth to avoid losing that turn. So it's generally worthwhile to spend\
  \ at least one blessing if you need it to temporarily close your location.</p> \n\
  \    <h2>Be prepared to close every location</h2> \n    <p>In most scenarios, defeating\
  \ the villain only allows you to win when you have permanently closed at least two\
  \ locations and spread the characters to cover all of the open locations. Be willing\
  \ to use blessings and to make permanent expenditures (like burying or banishing\
  \ cards) to temporarily close locations when you're ready to beat up the big bad.\
  \ It's the cost you must pay.</p> \n    <p><i>Corollary #1: Plan your expenditures\
  \ in advance.</i> The catch is that you don't want to expend so many resources while\
  \ temp closing that you can no longer defeat the villain. So, count your blessings\
  \ and other resources and decide which you're going to allocate to closing and which\
  \ to the villain fight. If you figure it out all at once at the start, you're more\
  \ likely to be successful.</p> \n    <h2>Be prepared to beat the villain</h2> \n\
  \    <p>When you decide to face the villain, you should be ready to deal with his\
  \ specific powers. Usually this means sending your best fighter to the villain's\
  \ presumed location, but it could also mean sending a character equipped with just\
  \ the right cards. Be particularly aware if a villain will require a specific check.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>(Note that the rules remain silent on whether you should read the villain\
  \ card before playing the scenario; even the Pathfinder Adventures app allows you\
  \ to either read the villain or skip it. Use this to adjust the difficulty of the\
  \ game for your group: If you keep losing because the villain kicks you to the curb,\
  \ try reading it in advance. If you're smashing the villain the first time you encounter\
  \ him, and regularly winning before the blessings deck is low, you may find it more\
  \ fun if you <i>aren't</i> prepared for this step.)</p> \n    <p><i>Corollary #1:\
  \ Have armor ready for before-you-act damage.</i> Some villains do damage in advance\
  \ of combat. When it's a big number like Black Fang's 1d4-1 or Nualia's 1d4, this\
  \ can be crippling, preventing you from winning the fight. So send characters with\
  \ armor against those pre-battle damage wielders!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-BlackFang_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n     <p>You <i>really</i> don't want to discard all of your weapons or spells\
  \ before the big fight.</p> \n    </div> \n    <h2>Use multiple characters to kill\
  \ a villain if you can</h2> \n    <p>Villains are the cards most likely to require\
  \ multiple checks to defeat. Although some characters, such as Valeros and Seoni,\
  \ can easily draw hands that can create two stunning attacks in a row, it's harder\
  \ for other characters, like Sajan and Lini. As a result, it's often best to face\
  \ villains with two characters, letting one take on each roll. This means that you\
  \ may want to wait until you've closed <i>three</i> locations before facing the\
  \ villain.</p> \n    <p><i>Corollary #1: Plan your battle in advance.</i> The order\
  \ of the checks can matter a lot. If you blow the first check, you're going to lose\
  \ whether or not you succeed on the second. Sometimes your toughest character should\
  \ go first and expend the most resources. Or sometimes the active player should\
  \ go first so that if he loses his hand, he can just choose to lose again.</p> \n\
  \    <h2>If you don't kill the villain, monitor your blessings</h2> \n    <p>Card\
  \ counting is usually more trouble than it's worth in PACG, but there's one situation\
  \ where that's not the case: If the villain escapes, he'll be shuffled together\
  \ with some blessing cards, then they'll be distributed among several decks. If\
  \ at all possible, keep count of the blessings in each of those decks. When you\
  \ find that a deck has more blessings than the location card says it should, you\
  \ know the villain isn't there! You can then concentrate elsewhere.</p> \n    <p>That's\
  \ it for the core tactics of Pathfinder Adventure Card Game play; in the next few\
  \ months I'm going to talk about some of the bigger-picture strategies, including\
  \ how to form parties and advance characters.</p> \n    <p>Shannon Appelcline<br>\
