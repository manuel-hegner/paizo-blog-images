  \ target=\"_blank\">Gen Con</a> in the middle of the Sagamore Ballroom. Spent the\
  \ morning sorting banners and getting them ready for hanging. This afternoon, the\
  \ team put the final touches on Pathfinder Society and Starfinder Society Roleplaying\
  \ Guild Guides. So without further ado, the Guides!</p> \n     <p>Season 9 of the\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy84k4?Pathfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Guide\"><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Society Roleplaying Guild Guide</em></a> doesn't see the upheaval of last year's\
  \ changes. Instead, we reviewed forum threads to find questions and clarifications.\
  \ As a result, this is a buff and polish job. The biggest changes are in formatting.\
  \ Our graphic designer, Emily, changed up some layout and made a stunning product.\
  \ I really like the coloring and design she put together for Season 9 and am interested\
  \ to hear your thoughts.</p> \n     <p>Season 1 of the <a href=\"/products/btpy9vlp?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Guide\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild Guide</em></a> borrows heavily from the\
  \ Pathfinder Guide. Which makes sense, since many of the items included in the guide\
  \ are organized play pieces. Much like Starfinder, you'll find many similarities.\
  \ But where things are different, they are different. Some of this appeared in preview\
  \ blogs over the past few months, like boon slots and infamy. We've also included\
  \ the two Starfinder Society base class ships, the Pegasus and the Drake. An expanded\
  \ Faction chapter outlines faction boons for each of our five factions. So while\
  \ you could skim over the guide and get the bare bones, I encourage you to delve\
  \ deep and enjoy the new campaign.</p> \n     <p>Both <a href=\"/products/btpy9u7x?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Quest-Into-the-Unknown\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild Quest: Into the Unknown</em></a> and <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy9tsv?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-100-Claim-to-Salvation\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #1-00: Claim to Salvation</em></a> utilize pre-generated\
  \ iconic characters. It is our pleasure to reveal these today. Starfinder Designer\
  \ Owen K. C. Stevens took point on turning our iconic characters—Altronus, Iseph,\
  \ Keskadai, Navasi, Obazaya, Quinn, and Raia—into playable characters. As with the\
  \ Pathfinder pregenerated iconic characters, they're now available for download\
  \ as a <a href=\"/products/btpy9ukw?Community-Use-Package-Starfinder-Society-Pregenerated-Characters\"\
  >Community Use Package</a>.</p> \n     <p>My closing bit of information is about\
  \ a change in our convention attendance schedule. After some deliberation, we decided\
  \ to forgo our attendance at PAX West. Instead, this November, several staffers\
  \ are attending PAX Unplugged in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Of all the PAX events,\
  \ Unplugged is most aligned with our products and goals and as such, we wish to\
  \ focus our efforts there.</p> \n     <p>But Seattleites' should not despair. There\
  \ are still a number of local conventions with Paizo organized play activities:\
  \ Dragonflight in August, Geek Girl Con in September, OrcaCon in January, and Norwescon\
  \ in March. In addition, after Gen Con ends, we will take a look at the schedule\
  \ of organized play activities at Emerald City Comic Con next March and get more\
  \ information out to potential show attendees. Of course, you can always come to\
  \ PaizoCon 2018, which is scheduled for May 25-28th in Seatac, Washington!</p> \n\
  \     <p>On Wednesday, the team will continue previewing our Gen Con releases. Until\
  \ then, I bid you happy reading!</p> \n     <p>Explore, Report, Cooperate!</p> \n\
