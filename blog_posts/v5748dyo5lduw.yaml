  \ itemprop=\"description\">Just over a week ago, at Gen Con, we announced the Pathfinder\
  \ Roleplaying Game hardcover book due to come out next August: <i>Mythic Adventures</i>.\
  \ Since then, there has been a fury of speculation and excitement about this book,\
  \ so I thought I would give a recap of what we’ve said so far about this new addition\
  \ to the game.</span></p> \n    <h2>What is mythic?</h2> \n    <p>The mythic rules\
  \ offer a new way to play Pathfinder. It uses all the rules that you are familiar\
  \ with, but it adds a new layer to the game. Mythic adventurers are elevated above\
  \ their non-mythic counterparts, gaining powers and abilities beyond their reach\
  \ that allow them to take on tougher foes and more daunting challenges. A mythic\
  \ character takes on the agents of deities, rushes headlong into the abyss, and\
  \ strives to build a legend, all while facing off against a wide variety of foes,\
  \ from common monsters to other mythic characters. If Elric, Fafhrd, Gray Mouser,\
  \ Hercules, or King Arthur were created in Pathfinder, they would be mythic characters.</p>\
  \ \n    <h2>Is this a replacement for epic rules?</h2> \n    <p>Mythic is not epic.\
  \ You can use the mythic rules with 1st-level characters just as easily as you can\
  \ with 20th-level characters. You can even use the mythic rules to continue to grow\
  \ in power once your PCs reach 20th level, taking on some of the toughest adversaries\
  \ in the game, from ancient dragons to demon lords. Meanwhile a low-level mythic\
  \ character might take on monsters that you are already familiar with, at a level\
  \ where non-mythic characters would face certain doom.</p> \n    <h2>So, how does\
  \ mythic work?</h2> \n    <p>Each mythic character must select a mythic path, which\
  \ defines some of the powers and abilities he gains, in addition to a few features\
  \ gained by all mythic characters. As a character advances, his mythic tier might\
  \ increase. Starting at 1st tier, a mythic character is quite a bit more resilient\
  \ and can draw upon his mythic power to accomplish incredible deeds. Once he reaches\
  \ 10th tier (the upper limit of mythic power), he is an unstoppable force, akin\
  \ to a demigod in some respects.</p> \n    <p>Mythic tiers are not gained by accumulating\
  \ experience points. Instead, a mythic character has to accomplish a specific number\
  \ of deeds to achieve the next tier of mythic power. Using this system, your mythic\
  \ tier is not tied to your character level. You still gain XP as normal, still gain\
  \ levels as normal, but occasionally you might increase your mythic tier as well,\
  \ adding a few new mythic abilities and powers to your character.</p> \n    <p>It\
  \ is important to note that while mythic rules add to the game, they do not necessarily\
  \ make the game more complex.</p> \n    <h2>What are the mythic paths?</h2> \n \
  \   <p>The rules currently include six paths for a mythic character to choose from.\
  \ Each path offers a unique set of abilities to choose from, as well as some abilities\
  \ that appear in more than one path. The paths you can choose from are as follows:</p>\
  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><b>Archmage:</b> Master of arcane magic, able to\
  \ call upon his mythic power to cast extra spells, penetrate defenses, and even\
  \ cast greater versions of existing spells. </p>\n     <p><b>Champion:</b> Unequalled\
  \ in his skill with weapons and styles of fighting. The champion can call upon his\
  \ mythic power to make devastating attacks, quickly move across any battlefield,\
  \ and strike many foes with a single swing.</p> \n     <p><b>Hierophant:</b> In\
  \ tune with the gods, be they deities or the spirits of the natural world, the hierophant\
  \ is the master of divine magic. The hierophant can heal even the most deadly wounds,\
  \ bring back allies from the dead, and wield the power of the gods.</p> \n     <p><b>Marshal:</b>\
  \ A leader of unparalleled vision, the marshal elevates those around him, granting\
  \ powerful abilities and bonuses to his allies, even if they are not mythic themselves.\
  \ Entire armies flock to his banner, and his close friends find his council invaluable.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>Trickster:</b> The master of many deceptions, the trickster can influence\
  \ the world around him in both subtle ways (with a smile) and more direct ways (with\
  \ a dagger in the back).</p> \n     <p><b>Warden:</b> Few can withstand the sort\
  \ of punishment that the warden takes regularly. No foe frightens this warrior,\
  \ because he knows that no blow could possibly lay him low. The warden uses his\
  \ resiliency to protect his allies, the people around him, and the lands he calls\
  \ home.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <h2>What else will be in <i>Mythic Adventures</i>?</h2>\
  \ \n    <p>In short, everything you need to add mythic rules to your game. The book\
  \ will contain the mythic paths, deeds, feats, spells, magic items, artifacts, monsters,\
  \ and a short sample adventure to get you started. In addition, <i>Mythic Adventures</i>\
  \ will include plenty of tips and advice for playing a mythic character and running\
  \ a mythic campaign. It will also feature ways that you can add mythic rules to\
  \ your existing campaign, even if it’s only for an adventure or two.</p> \n    <h2>Mythic\
  \ monsters?</h2> \n    <p>Oh yes. There will be mythic monsters. This book will\
  \ include a selection of monsters, from upgrades of existing beasts, such as the\
  \ mythic minotaur and medusa, to entirely new creations. In addition, there will\
  \ be a number of simple templates and rules to allow a GM to make any monster mythic.\
  \ There are also going to be a number of other toys to go in the GMs toolbox to\
  \ help make a game that can challenge such powerful characters.</p> \n    <h2>Can\
  \ I have it NOW?</h2> \n    <p>Not quite yet. <i>Mythic Adventures</i> will be released\
  \ at Gen Con 2013, but you’ll get a chance to play with the rules well before that.\
  \ We will be releasing a select portion of the rules set, to give you a chance to\
  \ play with the rules, tell us what works and what needs work. This playtest will\
  \ hopefully get underway by the end of September, but we will make sure to give\
  \ you a firm date as soon as we have one. Until then, I want to leave you with this\
  \ one little mythic rule for you to chew on.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><b>Amazing\
  \ Initiative (Ex):</b> At 2nd tier, a mythic character gains a +20 mythic bonus\
  \ on his initiative checks. In addition, he can spend one use of his mythic power\
  \ each round to take an additional turn, treating his initiative for this second\
  \ turn as his initiative roll without the +20 mythic bonus. Using this ability is\
  \ a free action that must be decided at the end of his first action during the round.</p>\
