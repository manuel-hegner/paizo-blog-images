  \ \n    <p class=\"date\">Monday, June 19, 2017</p> \n    <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"\
  > \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Religion is an important part of daily life\
  \ in both the Pact Worlds and the wider galaxy beyond. While the gods rarely take\
  \ an active, personal role in mortal affairs, there can be no doubt that their churches\
  \ and devotees wield great power and influence—for both good and ill. The people\
  \ of the Pact Worlds venerate a multitude of gods and goddesses, but there are 20\
  \ deities who are widely worshiped throughout the system—the \"core deities\" of\
  \ the <a href=\"/starfinder\">Starfinder</a> setting.</p> \n     <p>First, let's\
  \ take a look at a few familiar gods who have remained popular for thousands of\
  \ years. Their faiths have evolved over time, but they remain more or less the same\
  \ as they were on lost Golarion.</p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <div class=\"blurb120\"\
  >\n       <a href=\"/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7101-Sarenrae.jpg\"><img src=\"\
  /image/content/Starfinder/PZO7101-Sarenrae_120.jpeg\"></a>\n      </div> \n    \
  \  <h3>Iomedae</h3> \n      <p class=\"collapse\"><i>LG goddess of honorable battle,\
  \ humanity, justice, and valor</i></p> \n      <p>Iomedae was once a mortal human\
  \ on Golarion, and with that planet's disappearance, she has become known as the\
  \ Spirit of Golarion, the patron goddess of humanity.</p> \n      <h3>Lao Shu Po</h3>\
  \ \n      <p class=\"collapse\"><i>NE goddess of assassins, rats, spies, and thieves</i></p>\
  \ \n      <p>Grandmother Rat is regarded as the patron deity of the ysoki—even if\
  \ most ratfolk seek to placate Lao Shu Po rather than venerate her.</p> \n     \
  \ <h3>Pharasma</h3> \n      <p class=\"collapse\"><i>N goddess of birth, death,\
  \ fate, and prophecy</i></p> \n      <p>Every species that lives and dies worships\
  \ the Lady of Graves to some extent, because no matter where in the universe a sentient\
  \ creature dies, its soul travels to the Boneyard to be judged by Pharasma.</p>\
  \ \n      <h3>Sarenrae</h3> \n      <p class=\"collapse\"><i>NG goddess of healing,\
  \ redemption, and the sun</i></p> \n      <p>The Dawnflower is generally seen as\
  \ the goddess of the Pact Worlds' sun in particular (sometimes called the Dawnflower's\
  \ Star in her honor), though Sarenrae draws her power from suns across the universe.</p>\
  \ \n      <h3>Zon-Kuthon</h3> \n      <p class=\"collapse\"><i>LE god of darkness,\
  \ envy, loss, and pain</i></p> \n      <p>Zon-Kuthon's priests seek to pierce the\
  \ veil of the Great Beyond and expose themselves to what lies there, hoping to achieve\
  \ the same apotheosis that ages ago transformed their deity into the Midnight Lord.</p>\
  \ \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>But the traditional deities of Pathfinder are not\
  \ the only beings worthy of worship in the Pact Worlds. New gods have joined the\
  \ old, including the following.</p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <div class=\"blurb180\"\
  >\n       <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7101-Devourer.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7101-Devourer_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7101-Triune.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7101-Triune_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n      </div> \n      <h3>The Devourer, The Star-Eater</h3> \n      <p class=\"\
  collapse\"><i>CE god of black holes, destruction, and supernovas</i></p> \n    \
  \  <p>Eons ago, the Material Plane sprang into existence in an instant, and someday\
  \ it will end just as abruptly, as all creation ceases to exist. The Devourer seeks\
  \ to hasten this inevitable end and unmake the entire plane, eradicating all matter\
  \ and energy until nothing remains, not even the Devourer itself. Every machine\
  \ that breaks, every living thing that dies, every star that goes supernova, every\
  \ photon sucked into a black hole, every galaxy that goes dark—all these and more\
  \ are said to be the handiwork of the Devourer.</p> \n      <p>The Devourer has\
  \ no name, no form, no being. It is less a god than a primal force of the universe—\
  an embodiment of malicious entropy, concerned only with the obliteration of all\
  \ reality. Heedless of the meaningless existence of life in all its myriad forms,\
  \ it cannot be reasoned with, delayed, or halted, and it largely ignores the pleas\
  \ and prayers of even the crazed cultists who venerate the Star-Eater as a god.\
  \ When the Devourer has consumed everything and the mortal world expires, there\
  \ will be no rebirth, no second creation—only an immeasurable void of nothingness.\
  \ When the end finally comes, Devourer cultists believe, space-time itself will\
  \ weep the blood of the gods before finally passing into nothing.</p> \n      <h3>Triune,\
  \ The All-Code</h3> \n      <p class=\"collapse\"><i>N god of artificial intelligence,\
  \ computers, and the Drift</i></p> \n      <p>The robotic inhabitants of Aballon\
  \ labored for centuries to create an artificial deity they called Epoch. The machines\
  \ eventually succeeded, but upon achieving godhood, Epoch found two other ascended\
  \ artificial intelligences like itself: a living construct called Brigh that had\
  \ become the goddess of clockwork and invention, and the uploaded consciousness\
  \ of an alien android named Casandalee who achieved divinity as an \"Iron God\"\
  \ on pre-Gap Golarion. In an eyeblink, these three merged and became one, a tripartite\
  \ deity far greater than the sum of its parts—the new god Triune.</p> \n      <p>Triune\
  \ is a single entity, but each of its three aspects retains its own personality\
  \ and portfolios. Known as \"the Precursor,\" the Brigh aspect represents the foundation\
  \ that all technology rests on, and is worshiped as a goddess of invention, machines,\
  \ and technology. The Casandalee aspect, also called \"the Created,\" embodies technology's\
  \ success in creating new forms of consciousness, and is venerated as a deity of\
  \ artificial life, emotion, reincarnation, and renewal. Triune's third and final\
  \ aspect is Epoch, named \"the Transcendent.\" Epoch epitomizes the pinnacle of\
  \ machine evolution, revered as the god of artificial intelligence, programming,\
  \ and robots.</p> \n      <p>All AIs, computers, machines, programs, and robots\
  \ are the domain of the All-Code, but Triune is most famous for discovering (and\
  \ perhaps creating) the Drift, as well as the subsequent dissemination of Drift-based\
  \ starship technology to cultures across the galaxy.</p> \n     </blockquote> \n\
  \     <p>That's just some of the gods that have a major role to play in Starfinder.\
  \ We'll be previewing the rest of Starfinder's deities in the coming weeks, but\
