  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">This month\
  \ sees the epic* conclusion to the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/ruinsOfAzlant\"\
  >Ruins of Azlant Adventure Path</a>. Subscribers have already got their hands on\
  \ digital copies of <a href=\"/products/btpy9xf0?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-126-Beyond-the-Veiled-Past\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #126: Beyond the Veiled Past</em></a> and print copies\
  \ are soon to follow. As the author for \"Beyond the Veiled Past,\" I'm thrilled\
  \ to see this adventure finally getting out into the wild... because I've been holding\
  \ onto some secrets.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderAdventurePath/PZO90126-SkumOpener.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>After our glorious Managing Developer, Adam Daigle, assembled\
  \ the Ruins of Azlant writing team, all of us writers began conspiring together.\
  \ As the author of the final adventure, I ended up with the challenging task of\
  \ ensuring that various plots established earlier in the adventure path came to\
  \ a suitably climactic conclusion. Ever a fan of traditional RPG video games, I've\
  \ always had a soft spot for the \"searching for friends\" moment; a portion of\
  \ the story where the PCs end up doing a montage journey to places they've visited\
  \ in earlier adventures. I worked close with a lot of fellow authors, especially\
  \ those handling the earlier adventures, to weave in some strong connections between\
  \ past events and the end of the campaign. So, expect to see a lot of familiar faces\
  \ and vistas in the opening act of this adventure!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Azlant was (and still is) a very crazy place. Researching\
  \ all the written Azlanti lore in Paizo products was one of the more fun projects\
  \ prior to writing the adventure. Myself and other authors would banter back and\
  \ forth about some random revelation we had discovered in a sourcebook about the\
  \ Azlanti or their alghollthu foes. Chats were alight with things like \"They literally\
  \ created new races\" to \"They colonized other solar systems!\" (turns out that\
  \ last one <a href=\"/products/btpy9ssr?Starfinder-Core-Rulebook\">might have some\
  \ ramifications</a>.) Getting a chance to play with alghollthu and Azlanti toys\
  \ in a high-level setting turned out to be really rewarding, and led to the creation\
  \ of some pretty ridiculous inventions and NPCs.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>In my mind, it's not a good adventure if you can't sneak\
  \ in a few setting references. Whether it be inserting a reference to an NPC who\
  \ led the invasion of your developer's pet continent or putting in a named version\
  \ of a monster you wrote for a previous adventure path backmatter, being the author\
  \ has its perks. While \"Beyond the Veiled Past\" is laden with new revelations\
  \ and further hints for ongoing campaign setting mysteries, I'd have to say that\
  \ there's one reference that stands above the rest. As someone with strong ties\
  \ to Paizo's Organized Play program, I've always had a strong interest in the Pathfinder\
  \ Society organization. With this adventure, I had the opportunity to answer a question\
  \ about one of the more mysterious elements of the Pathfinder Society's leadership:\
  \ what's up with the Decemvirate Helms? Turns out, these artifact level helmets\
  \ had a completely different role in ancient Azlant. You'll need to read (or play)\
  \ this adventure to find out what!</p> \n    <p>Overall though, Ruins of Azlant\
  \ is really about one thing: the alghollthu and Azlanti conflict. Such was the power\
  \ of these two great empires, that even millennia after their war's cataclysmic\
  \ conclusion, the echoes of their conflict can potentially reshape the world. Along\
  \ with the adventure I had the pleasure of writing, the backmatter articles in this\
  \ adventure go on to give GMs the ability to take their campaign, even new campaigns,\
  \ \"beyond the veiled past\" and into modern Golarion. Exploring the ruins of Azlant\
  \ was just the beginning; now it's up to the players to stop the veiled masters.</p>\
