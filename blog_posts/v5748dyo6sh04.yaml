  ></a> \n     </div> \n     <p>Welcome to the <i>Pathfinder Advanced Player’s Guide</i>\
  \ playtest! In the document below, you’ll find four new classes set to be introduced\
  \ in the <i>Advanced Player’s Guide</i> in July 2020, but before we can add them\
  \ to the game, we need your help to ensure they are the best they can be! To do\
  \ that, we need you to create characters using these classes and give them a try.\
  \ We’re hoping that each of these new characters offers you a style of play that’\
  s enjoyable, effective, and distinct from the currently available classes, allowing\
  \ you to tell even richer stories with diverse experiences in all modes of play.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Curious about what these classes are all about? Here is a brief synopsis\
  \ of each to get your character ideas flowing.</p> \n     <ul> \n      <li>The <b>investigator</b>\
  \ is a savvy, street-smart character who takes cases to uncover clues and solve\
  \ mysteries. This class ties to parts of the game that aren’t covered in depth in\
  \ the <i>Core Rulebook</i>, so the playtest will see if their approach to solving\
  \ mysteries is satisfying, while keeping the rules for the game as a whole flexible.</li>\
  \ \n      <li>The <b>oracle</b> commands divine powers by drawing from universal\
  \ concepts, casting powerful revelation spells that take a toll on their body and\
  \ manifest as a double-edged curse. We want to make sure the curse effects are fun\
  \ and engaging without disrupting the balance of the class compared to other characters.\
  \ For the playtest, we’ve selected only a subset of mysteries, but there will be\
  \ more in the final version.</li> \n      <li>The <b>swashbuckler</b> is the flamboyant\
  \ daredevil of the battlefield, tumbling through foes and entering a heightened\
  \ state to deliver devastating finishing blows. We’ll be testing a system that encourages\
  \ them to gain panache, a state of bombastic flair that lets them use more powerful\
  \ abilities. The playtest version emphasizes new rules specific to the class so\
  \ that we can playtest those thoroughly, but the final version might pick up some\
  \ of the fighter’s weapon feats suited to dueling.</li> \n      <li>The <b>witch</b>\
  \ serves a mysterious patron entity, casting spells and hexes learned through a\
  \ powerful familiar. This is the most flexible spellcasting class we’ve introduced,\
  \ since it allows you to build your own path by selecting not only feats, but also\
  \ lessons from your patron. We want to make sure those options work well both narratively\
  \ and mechanically across all three of the spellcasting traditions the witch can\
  \ gain access to.</li> \n     </ul> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\

  \ \n     </div> \n     <h2>How to Playtest</h2> \n     <p>The playtest will run\
  \ until December 2nd, 2019. We’re looking for your feedback, comments, and criticisms\
  \ regarding these classes, but we’re focusing our attention on feedback from play.\
  \ Make new characters, use them as PCs or adversaries, and run a few game sessions\
  \ or encounters incorporating them!</p> \n     <h3>What the Playtest Is, and What\
  \ it Isn’t</h3> \n     <p>When playtesting these classes, remember that almost anything\
  \ can change based on the results of the playtest! These are early iterations of\
  \ the new classes; some abilities might be a bit extreme or stretch some assumptions\
  \ of the game, and the best way to find out if we’ve gone too far (or in the wrong\
  \ direction) is for us to deliver these classes into your hands. If you’re new and\
  \ used to open betas on a video game where there’s mostly only small refinements,\
  \ this will be a different experience. If you’re a veteran of the Pathfinder Playtest\
  \ for the new edition of the game, you should note that because the playtest window\
  \ is relatively short this time, we don’t expect to release any changes to these\
  \ classes during the playtest itself, but your thoughts and feedback will still\
  \ be vital in shaping the final versions of the classes.</p> \n     <h3>How Can\
  \ You Help</h3> \n     <p>We’d like you to play these classes in a variety of levels\
  \ and situations. If you’re looking for a published adventure to get some standardized\
  \ feedback, we recommend trying out <i>Fall of Plaguestone</i>, which offers a stand-alone\
  \ experience at some of the most commonly played levels of the game with some particularly\
  \ challenging series of combats that can help put the classes through their paces.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Once you’ve had a chance to try the classes, you can submit your feedback\
  \ in the following ways. <b>If you only have time for one form of feedback, we’\
  d ask you to please take the survey.</b> It makes it easier for us to hear and apply\
  \ your feedback, since it’s more structured and puts your responses directly at\
  \ our fingertips. </p> \n     <ul> \n      <li><b>Surveys:</b> Head to <a href=\"\
  https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/APGClassSurvey\">https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/APGClassSurvey</a>\
  \ and <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/APGOpenResponse\">https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/APGOpenResponse</a>\
  \ to take surveys that will allow us to gather your responses. These surveys will\
  \ be available starting Tuesday, November 12, 2019 and they will remain open until\
  \ the end of the playtest.</li> \n      <li><b>Forums:</b> On <b>paizo.com</b>,\
  \ you’ll find a <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/forums/pathfinder/second/advancedPlayersGuidePlaytest\"\
  >general forum for discussion and announcements</a>, plus forums for each of the\
  \ four new classes. When you post to the forums, look for existing threads on your\
  \ topic before starting a new one. Remember that every poster is trying to make\
  \ the game better for everyone, so please be polite and respectful.</li> \n    \
  \ </ul> \n     <p><a href=\"https://paizo-images.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/image/download/PZO2105+Character+Playtest.pdf\"\
  >You can find the downloads right here</a>. We’d like to thank you for participating\
  \ in the <i>Advanced Player’s Guide</i> playtest, and we’re looking forward to seeing\
  \ what you think and using your feedback to make these classes the best they can\
  \ be!</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Mark Seifter<br> <i>Designer</i></p> \n \
