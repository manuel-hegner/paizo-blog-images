  \  <p itemprop=\"description\">Hello! Hello. Hello again, to some of you.</p> \n\
  \     <p>It's been a while since I've done this, written a blog for Paizo. About\
  \ four years, in fact, which seems at once unbelievably historic but also just yesterday.\
  \ Four years ago is when I said goodbye to Paizo so I could go out and see the world.\
  \ Now, I have returned to find a place both strange and familiar, filled with faces\
  \ I recognize and a few I don't. The cubicles are on the other side of the building\
  \ now. There is a new Costco next door. The post office across the street seems\
  \ smaller, though it isn't.</p> \n     <p>The first thing I noticed upon reentering\
  \ Paizo's doors is how quiet the office still is. This observation may sound sobering,\
  \ but it is in fact quite a good thing, no, a great thing. There's a hum of patient\
  \ discipline within these halls, where the vibration of the air conditioner is punctuated\
  \ by the clicking of mice and the tapping of keyboards, the shuffling of papers\
  \ and the murmur of creative consultation. This is a stark contrast to the world\
  \ outside, which is fast, loud, and impatient, where you can pay at the register\
  \ and have your soy vanilla no-foam no-milk latte in your hands in ninety seconds,\
  \ where you must listen to the sounds of the city outside your window, the crash\
  \ of trash in the garbage bin and strangers yelling into the night and neighbors\
  \ playing strange, nauseating music. Between the cocoon-like walls of Paizo, though,\
  \ there is a ward against the everyday annoyances of the outside world. There is\
  \ a scholarly tranquility here that I have yet to find almost anywhere else.</p>\

  \      <p></p>\n     </div> \n     <p>Where have I been, anyway? Around, mostly.\
  \ I tried a stint in marketing. I lived on a farm in Hawaii for eight months. Most\
  \ people ask me about that. The farming, not the marketing.</p> \n     <p>Many people\
  \ say they wish to move to Hawaii, but few actually make it past the first step.\
  \ In September of 2017, my wife and I sold all our belongings, put what little was\
  \ left in storage, and took a one-way flight to the Big Island. We had no return\
  \ date, no idea whether we'd even want to return. We were prepared to make a go\
  \ of living in this strange new world and carving out a home of our own amid palm\
  \ trees and lava rocks. And we were prepared to face many trials on our quest, an\
  \ adventure that would have us labor upon rocky soil and live beneath a tarp alongside\
  \ wild nocturnal pigs.</p> \n     <p>There are many monsters in Hawaii, a fact which\
  \ may surprise you. Big beautiful fish and big ugly centipedes alike are found in\
  \ abundance. Powerful volcanic goddesses and mythical pygmy natives and invisible\
  \ animal spirits lurk in the verdant hills. An array of amazing birds can be seen\
  \ only on these remote isles: handsome 'io, brooding pueo, humble nene, and dazzling\
  \ i'iwi. There are green spotted geckos, of course, but also color-shifting chameleons\
  \ and draconian anoles and boisterous coqui frogs. Vermin like the Asian tiger mosquito\
  \ and the cane spider and hundreds of species of semi-slug can give you quite a\
  \ fright. It is a magical land as rife with beasts as it is steeped in legends.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>During my time in Kona, I swam with manta rays and tiger sharks, explored\
  \ volcanos ancient and active, witnessed flash floods and dry lightning, and sank\
  \ my hands into literally tons of dirt. The fauna of Hawaii are loud and skittish\
  \ but the people are quiet and friendly. It is an atmosphere of relaxation, where\
  \ importance is placed on family, friends, food, and maintaining a healthy balance\
  \ between mind and body, a phenomenon generally known as the spirit of aloha.</p>\
  \ \n     <div class=\"blurb360\">\n      <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20181127-MilkyWay\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20181127-MilkyWay_180.jpeg\"></a>\
  \ \n      <p></p>\n     </div> \n     <p>Spending countless days dozing in a hammock\
  \ slung between two palm trees by the beach does strange things to you, it turns\
  \ out. I quickly realized that voyages of the mind are just as important as voyages\
  \ to physical locales, if not more so, for maintaining the aforementioned mind-body\
  \ balance. A good book can teach you as much about life as an expedition to remote\
  \ islands and can take you to equally amazing places. It may seem counterintuitive,\
  \ but sometimes using less energy and taking things slowly, rather than continually\
  \ pushing yourself to the limit, can make you a better, faster learner. This stillness\
  \ of the heart is mandatory to appreciate the quietest things in life—gazing at\
  \ the stars, swimming in the ocean, writing. Stillness is a skill that can be picked\
  \ up quickly but that must be pursued relentlessly and with the understanding that\
  \ there is no such thing as mastery.</p> \n     <p>Coming back to the mainland,\
  \ I have discovered that you do not need to go as far as the middle of the ocean\
  \ to uncover the wonders that surround us. In Seattle, gunmetal gray condos and\
  \ shiny Teslas meet you at every turn, but it is still a rare day that you do not\
  \ stumble upon some natural beauty—bands of cirrus streaking across a green sunset,\
  \ a red-winged blackbird flitting to and from its nest, a coyote prowling raised\
  \ gardens in a dusky neighborhood. But go far enough away from the city and you\
  \ will encounter the stuff that promises to burn most brightly in the tangles of\
  \ your memory—the reflection of the impossibly blue sky in a glacial lake, a lonely\
  \ goat trekking a foreboding snowy ridgeline, the galactic core of our galaxy bursting\
  \ from a layer of forest fire haze.</p> \n     <p>Based on my limited life experience,\
  \ I have some basic advice for anyone who wants to take a step back from the grindstone\
  \ and try to get re-centered: Take walks. Read old novels. Nap daily. Stretch your\
  \ back. Watch birds. Breathe. Play.</p> \n     <p>The things I saw and heard and\
  \ smelled and touched during my sabbatical reminded me why I love games like Pathfinder\
  \ so much—because roleplaying games can take us to places that make us wonder, make\
  \ us think, make us still. Sitting at a table with friends, away from the distractions\
  \ of modernity, rolling lucky dice and maneuvering precious figurines, is a form\
  \ of mindfulness that I think everyone should have the chance to enjoy. As I said\
  \ before, you don't need to travel far to discover magic.</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  \ \n      <p></p>\n     </div> \n     <p>As any good adventuring party knows, it\
  \ is vital to have a good home base from which to launch expeditions and to which\
  \ to return for resupply. Perhaps that is why I have returned to Paizo's staff as\
  \ a developer on the Adventure Path line. At Paizo, I can retreat to these sacred\
  \ hallways, to the welcoming arms of likeminded explorers of fantastic universes,\
  \ for potions of creativity and psychic salves. The journeys we writers undertake\
  \ here are those of the human condition, of stories and games and characters and\
  \ challenges that help players consider their own role in worlds both imaginary\
  \ and real. Our efforts are of the utmost importance, I believe, because we create\
  \ worlds that inspire people to look around as well as within.</p> \n     <p>I return\
  \ to Paizo after four years of discovery—both self-discovery and discovery of others.\
  \ Four years may not seem long to those of you who have been running the same campaign\
  \ for decades, but it is long enough, perhaps, to return to an ancient craft with\
  \ clear eyes and fresh breath. Enough to reexplore past passions and imbue future\
  \ works with warm, steady energy. And enough, certainly enough, to once again brave\
  \ the unknown with friends new and old.</p> \n     <p>Patrick Renie<br> <i>Developer</i></p>\
