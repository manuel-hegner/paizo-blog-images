  \    <p>Born in a small village north of Trollheim in the Linnorm Kingdoms, the\
  \ child who would come to be known as Feiya was the daughter of two Tian merchants\
  \ from Minkai who had come over the crown of the world to Avistan to start a new\
  \ life. Travelers by nature, they spent the short northern summers making slow loops\
  \ through Hagreach and the Thanelands, facilitating trade. What few memories Feiya\
  \ has of that life are happy ones: the jostling of wagons, the smell of campfires,\
  \ and wandering alone through fields and forests, marveling as the wildness closed\
  \ around her.</p> \n     <p>That happiness came to a sudden halt on the fateful\
  \ day that brought her to the attention of a recently sundered coven of witches\
  \ who dwelled on the border with Irrisen. Led by a particularly cruel green hag\
  \ named Nysima, the coven had lost its youngest member to a squad of Blackravens\
  \ from Trollheim and was still reeling from its sudden loss of power. They witnessed\
  \ the child as she skipped away from the caravan stop, following a family of deer\
  \ deep into the woods, and immediately set upon her.</p> \n     <p>There’s no telling\
  \ what cruelties the witches would have visited upon the girl had they not suffered\
  \ their recent loss. As it was, another, no less horrific, fate awaited young Feiya.\
  \ The two crones seized the child and whisked her away to the east, their mad cackling\
  \ drowning out the young girl’s terrified screams. By the time they reached their\
  \ snow- and thatch-covered huts, they had given the child a new name and were already\
  \ envisioning the return of their lost powers.</p> \n     <p>The next twelve years\
  \ were a blur of pain, terror, and misery as Feiya endured the crones’ sadistic\
  \ attempts to teach her their dark craft. Alternating between tutelage and torture,\
  \ the witches frequently let their cruel natures impede their instruction. For while\
  \ the young girl showed unmistakable promise and aptitude, she also possessed a\
  \ defiance that only the harshest of punishments could suppress. On numerous occasions,\
  \ Feiya tried to escape her imprisonment, only to be tracked down and captured after\
  \ no more than a few hours. The retributions for these failed attempts have scarred\
  \ her body and mind in ways that no magic can ever heal.</p> \n     <p>One brisk\
  \ autumn day, after being beaten for failing to properly brew a batch of poisonous\
  \ blue whinnis, Feiya was sent off to gather herbs. While harvesting more whinnis\
  \ root, she spied a fox watching her from atop a large rime-covered rock. Unlike\
  \ the region’s typical arctic specimens, this creature had a striking red and orange\
  \ coloration that stood in stark contrast to the endless snow. There was something\
  \ about the way the creature watched her that beckoned to Feiya. She approached\
  \ carefully, and was astonished by his calm and focus. As she neared, the fox trotted\
  \ a small distance away, turned, and gave her a look that was clearly an invitation\
  \ to follow. This process was repeated again and again, and before she knew it,\
  \ Feiya was following the fox on another escape attempt.</p> \n     <p>By sundown,\
  \ the two witches had realized Feiya’s intentions. Furious, they set off in pursuit,\
  \ confident that, as with all previous instances, their hunt would be brief. This\
  \ time, however, Feiya had guidance. The fox led her along trails never before seen\
  \ by human nor hag, staying always just ahead and out of reach. When she needed\
  \ nourishment, the fox led her to game and fresh water. When she needed rest, it\
  \ stood vigil while she slept. In this manner, Feiya was able to elude capture for\
  \ more than two weeks.</p> \n     <p>One particularly cold evening, however, Feiya’\
  s luck ran out. With her pursuers hot on her trail and the fox nowhere to be seen,\
  \ she found herself trapped in a river valley surrounded on three sides by impassable\
  \ mountains. Feiya could sense the witches closing in, could hear their promises\
  \ of pain on the chilling wind. She took shelter in a shallow cave behind the waterfall\
  \ that fed the river, a curious little grotto whose far wall was emblazoned with\
  \ a crude carving of a butterfly. Like an animal run to ground, Feiya steeled herself\
  \ for the coming confrontation. She had come too far this time to surrender without\
  \ a fight. She determined then and there that her days of living under someone else’\
  s yoke were over. She would have her freedom, either in this life or the next.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>It was at that moment that the fox reappeared. Only now, there was something\
  \ different in the way he approached her. He had always shown a preternatural intelligence,\
  \ but as Feiya stared into his eyes, she saw a consciousness and a determination\
  \ that would have frightened her had she not come to trust the animal so implicitly.\
  \ As she watched him, Feiya was startled by a sudden and overwhelming flurry of\
  \ sensations invading her mind. She sank, dazed, to the cave floor as the feelings\
  \ slowly crystallized into coherence. Less a voice than a series of emotions, the\
  \ promise it offered was unmistakable. Feiya said nothing, but her acceptance was\
  \ as clear as it was quick.</p> \n     <p>What followed will forever haunt Feiya’\
  s dreams. Raspy promises of pain and suffering rose above the din of the waterfall\
  \ as the witches drew near to cave mouth. Feiya could see the outlines of their\
  \ hunched bodies just beyond the blanket of cascading water, but before she could\
  \ act, another sound arose. It started as a low rumble, then quickly gained volume,\
  \ drowning out both hags and water and sending tremors through the cave floor. Then\
  \ the valley erupted with the screeching and roaring of what could only have been\
  \ a forest’s worth of wild animals, punctured occasionally by the shrill curse of\
  \ a hag.</p> \n     <p>Long minutes passed as Feiya stood, too frightened to move.\
  \ Then, as gradually as it began, the noise subsided until all that remained was\
  \ the crash of the waterfall. Feiya crouched down behind a rocky outcropping, afraid\
  \ to leave the shelter of the cave. As the minutes turned into hours, exhaustion\
  \ claimed her, and, despite her anxiety, she succumbed to a fitful sleep.</p> \n\
  \     <p>When dawn finally arrived, Feiya stepped out from the cave, not quite sure\
  \ what she was expecting to see. A fresh blanket of snow had covered the land, hiding\
  \ any clues she might have found concerning the events of the previous night. Yet\
  \ the feeling of relief was palpable. The fox crept up and paused at her side. She\
  \ was finally free.</p> \n     <p>Feiya never discusses the events of that night,\
  \ nor the particulars of the strange pact she entered into. She may one day try\
  \ to track down the parents she barely remembers, but for now she is content to\
  \ roam the world, relishing her freedom, seeking new experiences, and developing\
  \ her newfound power. Though she desperately desires the company of others, formative\
  \ years spent away from civilized society have left Feiya lacking in social graces,\
  \ and her awkwardness often leads to unfortunate misunderstandings. Nevertheless,\
  \ her inherent good nature tends to win out, and her occasional flares of temper\
  \ are countered by her steadfast loyalty to her friends. Feiya relishes travel,\
  \ and having identified the butterfly carving in the waterfall cave as the found-mark\
  \ of a Desnan priest, she gladly embraces that faith, hoping that her wanderings\
  \ may cast more light on who she really is—and what entity fosters her magical abilities.</p>\
