  >Mummy's Mask</a> include a whole bunch of things you've never seen before. One\
  \ of my favorites is the Trigger trait, which turns the most basic of activities—\
  reading cards—on its head, maybe forever.</p> \n    <p>The general theme of this\
  \ Adventure Path (at least early on) is that you're exploring a magically protected\
  \ tomb that's built for adventurers to ransack, but not without danger. We wanted\
  \ there to be lots of tricks and traps, the kind of things you want to know about\
  \ before they go off. Many of our players pick characters with examination powers—\
  Alahazra, Estra, and Zadim in this set—to scout out those surprises. Lots of boons\
  \ get you help along those lines. Even some banes.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Three very different ways to examine cards.</i>\n    </div>\
  \ \n    <p>With all that examining going on, we don't want examiners to be invulnerable\
  \ to our surprises. Hence, we needed a way to nail them too. So we came up with\
  \ powers on cards that go off when you peek at them. We first seeded a version of\
  \ this into <a href=\"/products/btpy9h3h\"><em>Wrath of the Righteous Adventure\
  \ Deck 4: The Midnight Isles</em></a>, on the card Blasphemy Demon.</p> \n    <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6024-BlasphemyDemon.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6024-BlasphemyDemon_180.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \     <br> <i>Everyone's favorite Wrath card!</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>It worked\
  \ well there, so Liz, Paul, and Gaby built it out in full in Mummy's Mask. To make\
  \ sure you don't miss these powers, we've given these cards the Trigger trait, and\
  \ because we want you to know it's there the second you look at the card, we've\
  \ put it at the top of the list and highlighted it in red. When you examine such\
  \ a card, you'll find that the first power begins \"When you examine this card,\"\
  \ and quite often, the words after that are meant to cause you pain.</p> \n    <p>Here\
  \ are some examples of that sort of pain.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n\
  \     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6030-BonecrusherWizard.jpg\"><img\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Fun fact: We didn't make up the word \"bonecrusher.\" It's a\
  \ real type of hyena!</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>Those are all horrible. I mean, in\
  \ a good way. Okay, mostly in a horrible way. It's not all bad, though! Plenty of\
  \ cards have a Trigger that you might like! Or at least might not hate so much.</p>\

  \     <br> <i>I dunno, she still looks pretty wrapped to me.</i>\n    </div> \n\
  \    <p>And do you think we'd send you into that blender alone? Nah, we've got some\
  \ cards that can take the sting off the Trigger trait for you.</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  \ like to dream...</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>So what's really going on here? Is the\
  \ goal of the set to stop you from examining cards? No! We give you lots of ways\
  \ to examine cards before you explore, and we expect you'll want to use them. But\
  \ we just want to put a little fear of the gods into you before you do so.</p> \n\
  \    <p>All of that examine-and-encounter might also seem frightening, but wait!\
  \ That's a free exploration. It's not a free exploration you can <i>control</i>,\
  \ mind you, but any port in a sandstorm, right?</p> \n    <p>As you can see, it's\
  \ a balance. As you'll see in later blogs in this series, just about everything\
  \ in <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/mummysMask\">Mummy's Mask</a> is a\
  \ balance. After all, if you're walking around a tomb full of traps and treasures,\
  \ it's best not to get too overconfident.</p> \n    <p>Mike Selinker<br> <i>Adventure\
