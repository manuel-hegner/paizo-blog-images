  \ itemprop=\"description\">I am very sorry to report to you all that Linda Zayas-Palmer’\
  s last day with Paizo was October 20th. Linda has been with Organized Play for more\
  \ than a decade, from her time as a GM to being hired at Paizo and eventually leading\
  \ development. She's launched two separate Organized Play programs, which is a feat\
  \ few can match. We will miss her terribly, and I will miss her especially as a\
  \ partner in crime (metaphorically, of course; we never did any crimes that you\
  \ can prove). If you are so inclined, please leave a nice message for her in the\
  \ comments below!</p> \n      <br> \n      <h2>Digital Adventure Releases</h2> \n\
  \      <p>These adventures will be available on November 29, 2023.</p> \n      <h3>Pathfinder\
  \ Society</h3> \n      <p><a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02epr\"><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Society Scenario #5-06: Ukuja, The First Wall</em></a>*<br> <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02eps\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #5-07: Sewer Dragon Crisis</em></a>*</p> \n   \
  \   <h3>Starfinder Society</h3> \n      <p><a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02ept\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #6-10: The Death of Kortus IV</em></a>*<br> <a\

  ><em>Starfinder Bounty #10: Those who were Taken</em></a></p> \n      <p>*part of\
  \ a subscription</p> \n      <br> \n      <h2>Organized Play Foundation/Guides to\
  \ Organized Play Down</h2> \n      <p>The Organized Play Foundation website, which\
  \ hosts the Guide to Organized Play, is currently down. At press time, we do not\
  \ yet have a timeline for restored service. As I have updates to share, I will post\
  \ them in <a href=\"https://paizo.com/threads/rzs43w6c?OPF-WebsiteGuide-Outage\"\
  >this thread</a>.</p> \n      <p>That thread also contains PDF exports of the most\
  \ recent editions of the Guide we have archived. We’re aware they are not the most\
  \ up-to-date versions, but they should work for the time being. We’re actively working\
  \ to get the Guides back up and running for you all!</p> \n      <br> \n      <h2>Pathfinder\
  \ Society and the Remaster</h2> \n      <p>Last week, we released the first broad\
  \ strokes of our plans to update characters to the Pathfinder Remaster! It’s a very\
  \ long blog and I could recap it here, but really, it’s best if you just <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sifn?Pathfinder-Society-and-the-Remaster\"\
  >read it yourself</a>; I promise it’s painless. When the books release on the 15th,\
  \ these rules will be added to the Guide to Organized Play in much more detail.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Also announced in that blog was the removal of Pathfinder Schools,\
  \ which are to be replaced with the easier and more fun Pathfinder Provisions. Enjoy\
  \ the new consumables, whose guidelines will be ready for use in play on November\
  \ 15 alongside <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02eoj?Pathfinder-Player-Core\"\
  ><em>Player Core</em></a> and <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02eok?Pathfinder-GM-Core\"\
  ><em>GM Core</em></a>! For the earliest access to the new content, <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy88qu?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Subscription\"\
  >subscribe to the Pathfinder Rulebook line today</a>.</p> \n      <br> \n      <h2>PAX\
  \ Unplugged</h2> \n      <p>Next time a monthly update posts, I’ll be at PAX Unplugged\
  \ in Philadelphia! You can register for the Warhorn and sign up for games <a href=\"\
  https://warhorn.net/events/pathfinder-starfinder-pax-unplugged-2023\"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Note that we are offering only a limited number of early signups for\
  \ our scenario tables. Per PAX Guidelines, demo offerings such as Pathfinder Bounties,\
  \ board game demos, and Starfinder 2 demos are strictly on a walk-up basis. We’\
  re also reserving a couple of seats at our scenario tables for walk-up players as\
  \ well.</p> \n      <p>We’ve still got room for a few more volunteers as well! If\
  \ you’re interested in helping us show off our games to the PAX Unplugged audience,\
  \ <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sidm\">get all the info and\
  \ register to volunteer here</a>.</p> \n      <br> \n      <h2>Sanctioning</h2>\
  \ \n      <p>October was a big month for us! Both <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02eom?Starfinder-Enhanced\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Enhanced</em></a> and <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02epv?Pathfinder-Adventure-Rusthenge\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Adventure: Rusthenge</em></a> hit shelves, and both are now sanctioned\
  \ for use in Organized Play! <em>Starfinder Enhanced</em>’s rules can be found on\
  \ the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/starfindersociety/characteroptions\">Starfinder\
  \ Society Character Options page</a>, and Rusthenge’s sanctioning documents can\
  \ be downloaded from the product page.</p> \n      <p>Next on our list is more adventure\
  \ content, with both the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/seasonOfGhosts\"\
  >Season of Ghosts AP</a> and the long-awaited (by me) <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02eai?Starfinder-Scoured-Stars-Adventure-Path\"\
  >Scoured Stars hardcover compilation</a> dropping in January. After that, Tian Xia\
  \ and the second half of the Pathfinder Remaster await us!</p> \n      <br> \n \
  \     <h2>GM Recognition</h2> \n      <h3>Campaign Service Coins</h3> \n      <p>This\
  \ month, several new Campaign Service Coins were awarded at local conventions! We\
  \ award these coins to members of the community who have gone above and beyond to\
  \ provide an exceptional program to the community at large. Campaign Coins are awarded\
  \ based on nominations; if you believe someone in your community is deserving of\
  \ this award (whether they are a Venture Officer or not), send an email to organizedplay@paizo.com\
  \ with their name and reasons. </p> \n      <p>Congratulations to:<br> <strong>Amie\
  \ Tracey</strong>, who now holds a campaign coin and OP ID #880<br> <strong>Robert\
  \ Wiesehuegel </strong>, who now holds a campaign coin and OP ID #881<br> <strong>Amber\
  \ Howell</strong>, who now holds a campaign coin and OP ID #882<br> and <strong>Jim\
  \ Dick (Xathos)</strong>, who now holds a campaign coin and OP ID #905</p> \n  \
  \    <h3>GM Ranks</h3> \n      <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5\
  \ ranking in any program involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the 5th\
  \ milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios\
  \ and 10 special scenarios, as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains\
  \ (program dependent). A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th\
  \ milestone is 650 hours!</p> \n      <p>This month, we had one GM earn their 5th\
  \ rank!</p> \n      <p><strong>5th Glyph (PFS2)</strong>: Half the Sky (Charlene)</p>\
  \ \n      <p>That’s all from me! Until next time: Explore! Report! Cooperate! And\
  \ get ready to Remaster!</p> \n      <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight:\
