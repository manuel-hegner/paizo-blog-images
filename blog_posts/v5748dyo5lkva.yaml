  \ \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">In a <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo5lktk?Wander-The-Planes\"\
  >previous blog</a>, I spoke generally about some of number of player-facing rules\
  \ elements found in <a href=\"/products/btpya1am?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Planar-Adventures\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder RPG Planar Adventures</em></a>, giving rough numbers of different\
  \ kinds of new mechanics for your characters.</p> \n    <p>Now I want to dig down\
  \ a little deeper and talk about something brand new. Amid the archetypes, spells,\
  \ magic items, and feats, <em>Planar Adventures</em> includes a new type of feats:\
  \ conduit feats. Here's how the book describes them.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ></a> \n     <p><i>Illustration by Ian Perks</i></p>\n    </div> \n    <blockquote>\
  \ \n     <h3>Conduit Feats</h3> \n     <p>Conduit feats grant the ability to draw\
  \ energies from other planes. The effects of conduit feats are supernatural and\
  \ do not function in an antimagic field or similar effect. In addition, since these\
  \ abilities require energies from other planes, you cannot use them in areas that\
  \ are warded against planar or dimensional travel (such as those under the effects\
  \ of dimensional lock or forbiddance) or when you have been denied this ability\
  \ (such as via dimensional anchor).</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>There are nearly\
  \ two dozen conduit feats, the most versatile of which is Planar Infusion. Each\
  \ of the planes (and demiplanes and dimensions) detailed in Planar Adventures has\
  \ a stat block listing things you've come to expect like alignment, gravity, time,\
  \ and how magic works there, but the stat blocks also contain other new pieces of\
  \ information. One of these is infusions. Infusions are meant to represent how planar\
  \ energies can affect characters if exposed over a period of time or during a significant\
  \ event. There are three tiers to infusions: basic, improved, and greater—each granting\
  \ powers unlocked by the Planar Infusion, Improved Planar Infusion, and Greater\
  \ Planar Infusion feats.</p> \n    <p>As an example, I'll share the infusions for\
  \ a demiplane near and dear to my heart—Xibalba.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\"\

  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PZO1141-BlackPyramid_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n     <p><i>Illustration by Fabio Gorla</i></p>\n    </div> \n    <blockquote>\
  \ \n     <h3>Infusions</h3> \n     <p>Basic The dread horrors of Xibalba infuse\
  \ your being, and there is little that can further unnerve you. Increase the save\
  \ DC of fear effects you create by 1, and you gain a +2 bonus on all saving throws\
  \ against fear effects.</p> \n     <p>Improved You can use phantasmal killer as\
  \ a spell-like ability once per day.</p> \n     <p>Greater You can use insanity\
  \ as a spell-like ability once per day.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Other conduit\
  \ feats grant your character unique abilities, all deeply linked to a particular\
  \ plane of existence. For example, Axiomatic Discourse helps you influence others,\
  \ Blazing aura wreathes you in flame, Malleable Form converts you to a semi-gelatinous\
  \ state, and Phasestrike lets you phase out a weapon and resolve attacks as touch\
  \ attacks. Here's a full example of one of these conduit feats, the wonderfully\
  \ named Chaos Reigns.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <h3>Chaos Reigns (Conduit)</h3>\
  \ \n     <p>The Abyss dreams of devastation; the slightest taste of its power is\
  \ an incitement to bare-fisted violence.</p> \n     <p><b>Prerequisite</b>: Knowledge\
  \ (planes) 3 ranks.</p> \n     <p><b>Benefit</b>: As a swift action, you can allow\
  \ Abyssal wrath to overtake you. While in this state, you can use one of your hands\
  \ as a slam natural attack that deals 1d6 points of damage (or 1d4 for Small creatures).\
  \ A creature that does not have hands can instead use a different part of its body\
  \ to make this slam attack.</p> \n     <p>You can use this feat's benefit for a\
  \ number of minutes per day equal to your ranks in Knowledge (planes). These minutes\
  \ need not be consecutive, but they must be spent in 1-minute increments.</p> \n\
