  \ Bulmahn, <i>Pathfinder RPG</i> Lead Designer</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Thursday,\
  \ March 20, 2008</p> \n   <p>I sat down with Jason Bulmahn, the mastermind behind\
  \ the <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG\"><i>Pathfinder RPG</i></a>, and picked his brain\
  \ for awhile.</p> \n   <p><b>What did you have in mind when you first starting working\
  \ on the <i>Pathfinder RPG</i>?</b></p> \n   <p>Since we first realized a new edition\
  \ of the game was imminent, Paizo developed several plans for how we would adapt\
  \ to the new publishing environment. One of those options involved ongoing support\
  \ of 3.5. Since last summer, I've been experimenting with the rules, tweaking the\
  \ things I thought needed some work and reinforcing the parts that I liked. When\
  \ Paizo made the decision to go full steam ahead with ongoing 3.5 support, I brought\
  \ the rules into the office and we began poring over them as a team. A lot of great\
  \ work came out of the past few months with nearly everybody in our editorial staff\
  \ offering up suggestions and ideas to make the rules even better.</p> \n   <p><b>What\
  \ changes (that are made in the <i>Pathfinder RPG</i>) will be the most impactful\
  \ to the gaming experience?</b></p> \n   <p>For me, a lot of the changes enacted\
  \ by the <i>Pathfinder RPG</i> are designed to smooth out some of the rough spots\
  \ of 3.5, while adding some spice to some rules elements that have become a bit\
  \ ordinary. One of my favorites is adjusting the turn undead rules to also heal\
  \ living creatures. This allows a cleric to actually cast some of his spells instead\
  \ of saving them for healing. It also allows the party to adventure a bit longer.\
  \ Combine that with reusable powers for both wizards and clerics and you have a\
  \ longer adventuring day, something the game sorely needed.</p> \n   <p><b>Do you\
  \ think the <i>Pathfinder RPG</i> will eventually replace 3.5 edition?</b></p> \n\
  \   <p> Since the core books for the 3.5 edition of the game are about to be out\
  \ of print, I think that the <i>Pathfinder RPG</i> will replace them as the common\
  \ reference point for those who are still interested in playing the rules system.</p>\
  \ \n   <p><b>Are there any surprising things in the <i>Pathfinder RPG</i>?</b></p>\
  \ \n   <p>Yes, quite a number of things actually. The changes to domains and arcane\
  \ schools, the unification of the various combat maneuvers to one simple system,\
  \ and the alterations to turning all seem to have surprised a number of people.\
  \ There are a lot of little surprises lurking in the rules too. We changed Intimidate\
  \ somewhat so that it can demoralize a foe for more than 1 round. It's not a huge\
  \ change, but it makes the skill a much more interesting option than it was. Changing\
  \ Dodge so that it is a flat +1 bonus to your Armor Class is another change that\
  \ works to simplify the game by removing the pesky need to remember who you are\
  \ using Dodge against. I think a lot of these little surprises have not been spotted\
  \ quite yet, and I look forward to discussing them with the playtesters.</p> \n\
  \   <p><b>What are your hopes for the <i>Pathfinder RPG</i>?</b></p> \n   <p>We've\
  \ got a long way to go before the <i>Pathfinder RPG</i> is in its finished form\
  \ and between now and then I am really looking forward to working with the fans\
  \ and playtesters to make this the game that we all want to play. I hope that the\
  \ finished game meets that goal, and I am confident that with more than 5,000 playtesters\
  \ on board, we will be able to solve any problem that stands in our way.</p> \n\
