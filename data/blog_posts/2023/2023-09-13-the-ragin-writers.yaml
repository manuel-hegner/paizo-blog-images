              <p>Hello, elementonauts!&nbsp;<a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02eju?Pathfinder-Rage-of-Elements"><em>Pathfinder Rage of Elements</em></a>&nbsp;has been out for a while now, and we hope you’ve been having a great time with your kineticists, elementals, travels to the elemental planes, and all sorts of new spells, items, and monsters. We wanted to take this chance to recognize the great authors who came together to make this project special.</p>
              <p>This book was initially concepted by Mark Seifter (who you’ll hear from shortly) before he headed over to his current gig. I took over as the design lead to shepherd the book along. Most of my work was outlining, coordination, and a massive amount of changes to switch the book to the Remastered rules late in the process.</p>
              <p>Before we get into everyone’s bios, I must talk about the contributions of Jessica Redekop and Sen H.H.S., who share cover credit with me. Getting that level of credit requires a massive amount of work, and they were both wonderful to work with and superb writers. Jess’s enthusiasm for the planes and building out fun characters made the book such a fun read, and Sen H.S.S.’s ideas for putting the elemental cycle into the game and Pathfinder setting and creating the Plane of Wood were invaluable and incredibly creative. I’d also like to shout out Paizo’s own Andrew White, who brought the Plane of Metal to life, and James Case, who plunged into the Plane of Water with aplomb. And Kent Hamilton’s beautiful concept art for elemental metal and wood helped guide designs throughout the process, especially of monsters and locations.</p>
              <p>In addition to the authors with full bios below, this book features excellent writing by Jason Bulmahn, James Case, Jessica Catalan, Andrew D. Geels, Luis Loza, Michael Sayre, Shay Snow, Levi Steadman, Mari Tokuda, and Linda Zayas-Palmer!</p>

              <h3>Logan Bonner (he/him)</h3>
              <p>(That’s me.) I’ve been designing tabletop RPGs since 2006, and am the Pathfinder Lead Designer, doing overwatch on the game rules as a whole. Lately I’ve been blooding, sweating, and tearing the Pathfinder Remaster books. After being one of the four designers of Second Edition, I’ve led&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder Secrets of Magic</em>&nbsp;to help set the template for how we could stretch our legs with rulebooks in Second Edition, and later led&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder Book of the Dead</em>, the remastered books, and at least one upcoming, unannounced tome. My biggest writing contribution to&nbsp;<em>Rage of Elements</em>&nbsp;was the kineticist class (with some expert help from the rest of the design team, so you can blame/thank Michael Sayre for the Ambush Bladderwort). You can find me on Twitter as @loganbonner and on Bluesky as @loganbonner.bsky.social.</p>

              <h3>Jason Keeley (he/him)</h3>
              <p>Hi folks, I'm Jason Keeley and I'm excited to have contributed even a small part to&nbsp;<em>Rage of Elements</em>. I've recently returned to Paizo as a Senior Developer for the Rules &amp; Lore team, which means that all I've written for Pathfinder Second Edition has been training for this time! When I'm not doing things for Paizo, I spend my time recording a couple of podcasts in the Know Direction network, collaborating with Joe Pasini on puzzles, and generally working on other TTRPG projects—like my cereal mascot game&nbsp;<em>This Compleat Breakfast</em>, available for free at&nbsp;<a href="https://herzwesten.itch.io/this-compleat-breakfast">https://herzwesten.itch.io/this-compleat-breakfast</a>! You can usually find me under the name "herzwesten" on most social media platforms.</p>

              <h3>Jon Morgantini</h3>
              <p>Hello there! I'm Jon, the Community and Social Media Manager here at Paizo. My work was focused on creatures of air and earth for&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder Rage of Elements</em>. It was my first freelance writing opportunity and it was so much fun! It's been very heartening to see the reaction to the book from everyone. I definitely have other projects coming down the line so you will just have to keep an eye out for my name in other places! When I'm not writing, I'm usually lost in Hyrule or perhaps some far corner of the galaxy, if not rereading the Wheel of Time series or whatever the dark fantasy du jour is. You can find me @loremasterjon over on Bluesky, where I soon hope to pontificate about writing my own Pathfinder Second Edition–compatible setting. In the meantime, play ALL the games!</p>
              <p><br></p>
              <h3>AJ Neuro (he/him and they/them)</h3>
              <p>Pura Vida! I'm AJ, a Costa Rican game designer. Writing the elemental backgrounds for&nbsp;<em>Rage of Elements</em>&nbsp;was my first official contribution to Pathfinder, but I've also written for the recently announced&nbsp;<a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sie7?Welcome-to-the-War-of-Immortals-Playtest"><em>Pathfinder War of Immortals</em></a>! A few of you might have also seen some of my&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ajneuro.com/pf2freecontent">free resources for the Pathfinder community</a>. I'm also a professional GM, and I run both official Pathfinder Second Edition adventures on Golarion, and adventures of my own making in my setting of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ajneuro.com/ex-nihilo">Ex Nihilo</a>! If you'd like to join one of my groups, or would like me to GM for your group, don't be shy and shoot me a message. By the way, we're actually a DID system, but we generally prefer to present as an individual; it's just easier for us (<em>waves at all the other plurals reading this</em>) :)</p>

              <h3>Jessica Redekop (she/they/he)</h3>
              <p>Hello! I'm Jess, and I like elementals, the planes, and the elemental planes. I got to write a lot of&nbsp;<em>Rage of Elements</em>&nbsp;(enough to get my name on the cover!) but my favorite section is the introduction to the air chapter, with the mercurial air narrator, Shanaria.</p>
              <p>I love this book and I'm so grateful for the opportunity to write such a large portion of it. A book focused on the elemental planes, giving them the compelling and interesting presentation they've always deserved, is like my ultimate dream project. It's weird to feel so early in my career but to have already achieved something so monumental and important to me. I hope&nbsp;<em>Rage of Elements</em>&nbsp;helps to open the elemental planes in your games as fun, cool places your characters want to explore!</p>
              <p>When I'm not writing, you can find me on the Know Direction podcast network as a cohost of Legend Lore and cast member on Tavern Rats, a new actual play. On the social medias, I'm @tectonomancer.bsky.social.</p>
              <h3>Mark Seifter</h3>
              <p>Hi everyone, Mark Seifter here! For those who don't know me, I've been the design lead on over 100 tabletop RPG game titles and worked on even more for Paizo and various other companies in the tabletop RPG industry, and I was one of the four leads on the creation of Pathfinder Second Edition.</p>
              <p>I love writing about elemental options, and in&nbsp;<em>Rage of Elements</em>, I especially enjoyed working on the elemental eidolon, which I hope gives you a fun and different playstyle than the existing options. I also authored the Lysianassa deity entry, the aether and void sidebar in the introduction (which turned out even more interesting with the advent of void damage), and more! I hope you enjoyed them.</p>
              <p>You can check out my Twitch stream, Arcane Mark, with Linda Zayas-Palmer at&nbsp;<a href="file:///Users/simonedsalle/Paizo%20Creative%20Dropbox/Groups/Active%20Jobs/Blogs/23-09-13%20Rage%20of%20Elements%20Authors/old/twitch.tv/arcanemark">twitch.tv/arcanemark</a>&nbsp;and the Roll for Combat Live stream with Stephen Glicker at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/@RollForCombat">www.youtube.com/@RollForCombat</a>.</p>

              <h3>Sen H.H.S.</h3>
              <p>Hi all! Sen H.H.S. here and long time no see! Working as the cultural consultant and cover author of&nbsp;<em>Rage of Elements</em>&nbsp;was a wild ride, and I'm delighted that everyone is enjoying the book. I hope to hear your stories about your adventures in the returning Planes of Metal and Wood sometime in the near future. As a cover author, I worked on a little bit on everything, from some metal, wood, earth, fire, and water spells and items, to the four elemental lords Ayrzul, Kelizandri, Laudinmio, and Shumunue. I also did the introductions for the Plane of Wood and the Churn of Elements, plus creatures such as the nightwood guardian, ore louse, marajau, and some fire elementals. (Lava otters are the best!) I hope all of those help make your upcoming planar adventures all the more exciting! As for what's coming up, please mark your calendars for the Season of Ghosts Adventure Path, which begins with&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #196: The Summer That Never Was</em>&nbsp;at the end of this year! You can find me nowadays on Bluesky at @senhhs.bsky.social or you can see what I'm retweeting on Twitter @SenHHS.

              <p>Marhaba everyone! I’m Shahreena and I've been freelancing for Paizo for about five years.&nbsp;<em>Rage of Elements</em>&nbsp;was a particularly exciting project to work on, as I was not only involved as a writer, but also as a cultural consultant. I was inspired by the creative muse in pre-Islamic poetic traditions to create gennayn; by stories of nightmarish spirits to contribute to jaathoom; by Middle Eastern hospitality to create faydhaan shuyookhs; and by the storyteller Shahrazaad, from&nbsp;<em>Alf Layla wa Layla</em>, or&nbsp;<em>1001 Nights</em>, to develop Shazathared.</p>
              <p>Beyond writing, I helped reconceptualize the genies. You may have noticed the cleanup of similar-sounding genie names, new genie lore and abilities more engaged with folklore, and old genie names changed to theme-appropriate names. (As someone raised in a Muslim household, I was especially happy to contribute to the removal of “shaitan” for earth genie!) I also engaged in Arabic grammatical discussions on nonbinary terms of address in search of ways to address genie nobles—fun times! I hope you enjoy these genies as much as I enjoyed working on them.</p>
              <p>If you're looking for a Middle East specialist for freelance work, feel free to contact me on Discord at Shahreena1.</p>

              <h3>Solomon St. John (they/them)</h3>
              <p>Greetings internet. I go by Sol day-to-day and, in addition to being one of the freelancers who contributed to&nbsp;<em>Rage of Elements</em>, I was also the editing lead, a role I also fill for both Pathfinder and Starfinder Society over in Organized Play.</p>
              <p>Versatile heritages are one of my favorite features in all of Pathfinder Second Edition, so I leapt at the chance to write the talos heritage; I also wrote the accompanying creature stat block, the section on zuhra genies, and all of the wood elementals from wood wisps to the twins of rowan. That last bunch was especially fun, since I could draw inspiration from all sorts of places—from wooden dolls and obscure folklore like the vegetable lamb, to clonal organisms like the IRL “trembling giant” and the existential concept of growth itself. It’s my largest Paizo writing contribution to date and I’m delighted you all finally get to enjoy the fruits of our hard work.</p>
              <p>My next Paizo project is just around the corner, so keep an eye out for&nbsp;<em>Starfinder Society Scenario #6-07: Race for the Dustwarren Cup</em>. Find me online @stjohnsol.bsky.social for a quiet feed of reblogs and cat photos.</p>

              <h3>Ruvaid Virk</h3>
              <p>Hiya folks! My name's Ruvaid, and I've been a writer for Paizo for a little while now. You might have seen some of my past work like the alter ego archetype from&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder Dark Archive</em>,&nbsp;the&nbsp;<em>retrieval prism</em>&nbsp;talisman, or a large part of the Niswan entry for Jalmeray in&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Impossible Lands</em>. It was a blast working on&nbsp;<em>Rage of Elements</em>&nbsp;with a lot of awesome people. This time, I got to really light the spark of imagination to bring you the entry for Ymeri, Queen of the Inferno, some of the new fire spells (like one where you can summon a bunch of fire ants at someone), a giant metal puzzle cube (the pelegox), and a fiery barbecue spitmaster (the brochmaw, who is also unofficially named Chimothy Chunger).&nbsp;If you want to see more of me and my work, I'm on Twitter (for now) @Darth_Ruvaider and BlueSky @darthruvaider.bsky.social.</p>

              <h3>Andrew White (he/him)</h3>
              <p>Hello! I’m Andrew, full-time member of Paizo’s tech team (and, lately, project coordinator for a bunch of Paizo’s virtual tabletop projects, most notably our premium Foundry adventure modules) and freelance contributor to&nbsp;<a href="https://andrewwhite.carrd.co/">15+ Pathfinder and Starfinder releases</a>&nbsp;<em>that you know about so far</em>, including&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder Secrets of Magic</em>,&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder Book of the Dead</em>, the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder Howl of the Wild</em>,&nbsp;<em>Starfinder One-Shot #2:The Great Grav-Train Robbery</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Starfinder Adventure: Drift Crisis Case Files</em>.&nbsp;<em>Rage of Elements</em>&nbsp;was one of my favorite projects to date, and I had an absolute blast (this is not a kineticist joke, unless you want it to be) writing the lore of the Plane of Elemental Metal, its thirteen new elementals, and its divine reality-munching isopod Ferrumnestra, the Lady of Rust. You can find me on Twitter at&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/plaguecontrol">@plaguecontrol</a>&nbsp;(or Twitter-but-not-on-fire at&nbsp;<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/plaguecontrol.bsky.social">@plaguecontrol.bsky.social</a>), or you can listen to the Elemental Metal playlist that I made just for you at&nbsp;<a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6BahPTNUQjId2OIurnKMrJ">https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6BahPTNUQjId2OIurnKMrJ</a>.</p>
