  \   <p class=\"date\">Monday, February 14, 2011</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"\
  > \n    <p>For some of us, Valentine's Day is just another day. We go to work, come\
  \ home, maybe hang out with our significant others a bit or send the kids off to\
  \ the sitter for a rare night out. For other people, however, Valentine's Day carries\
  \ more significance, and flat-out demands acknowledgement. They see it as an excuse\
  \ to truly cut loose, to go all-out with the romance and treat it like a real holiday.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>And then, apparently, there's a third type of person: the type for whom\
  \ Valentine's Day means a chance to go <i>totally insane</i>. Such appears to be\
  \ the case with Pathfinder Tales author Kevin Andrew Murphy. How else can you explain\
  \ the fact that he chose the occasion to, without any prompting or warning, write\
  \ us an entire <i>heroic crown</i> of sonnets immortalizing the iconic characters'\
  \ backgrounds in prose. (For those of you who've forgotten your 400-level literature\
  \ classes, a \"heroic crown of sonnets\" is a specialized form of poetry in which\
  \ you have 14 sonnets, each linked by their first and last lines, plus a fifteenth\
  \ which is made up exclusively of the previous sonnets' linking lines, in order.\
  \ Needless to say, it's incredibly difficult to do well.)</p> \n    <p>I'd say more,\
  \ but I'm still processing the whole thing, so I think it's better to just post\
  \ the sonnets in their entirety. Happy Valentine's Day!</p> \n    <blockquote> \n\
