  \ you. Don't be shy, now. You've been looking for us for a very long time, after\
  \ all.</p> \n    <p>I've seen that expression on the faces of mortals over the centuries.\
  \ Most of them are satisfied dealing with what's set in front of their faces, but\
  \ you—you're one of the ones that looked beyond. Beyond the material, beyond even\
  \ good and evil, beyond the petty squabbling of angels and devils that amounts to\
  \ nothing more than the shuffling of poker chips around a table for all eternity.\
  \ You're looking for the monitors. You're looking for the ones that make it all\
  \ work.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderCampaignSetting/PZO92114-Opener.jpg\"\

  \ it who drew you here? Did you feel the pull of Ceyannan the Shepard, like a call\
  \ to a lost soul? Did you find salvation from danger in one of the graveyards and\
  \ gargoyles of Vavaalrav, the Steeple's Skull? Did you, perhaps, discover a sentence\
  \ or stray page of Tabris' <a href=\"/products/btq01x4d?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Concordance-of-Rivals\"\
  ><em>Concordance of Rivals</em></a>? I, for one, think it's his best work.</p> \n\
  \    <p>It is, of course, natural that you would come to us above all others. The\
  \ axiomites have no understanding of mortals, and their Primal Inevitables are slowly\
  \ crumbling and coming to stand before our Lady of Graves. No matter how hard Jerishall\
  \ strives to keep the planets turning in their perfect orbits, or how thorough Otolmens\
  \ is in maintaining her laws of physics, in the end, they all must come to us. Please\
  \ don't make me cry by expressing interest in those wretched protean lords. We're\
  \ still cleaning the Jistkan graffiti off the walls from the last time the Mother\
  \ of Tongues got in here.</p> \n    <p>As for the Monad… there aren't many who can\
  \ catch that one's attention. Certainly, none have ever caught more than a scrap\
  \ of its power.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderCampaignSetting/PZO92114-Monad.jpg\"\

  \ about us. You're one of a very select few, as I'm sure you know. You even dug\
  \ up some of the mantras that can call us forth in place of our true names. Such\
  \ dedication requires acknowledgement—we're not ones to let our mortal agents go\
  \ without tools to help them. You'll have divine protection and boons to benefit\
  \ your station, of course. I might even talk that old miser Iliyai into showing\
  \ you some of his ritual books.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\

  \ if you're willing. We have a small issue with some pesky akizendri proteans scrambling\
  \ up our records. Just last week alone we got a warlord's file mixed up with a milkmaid's,\
  \ and let's not even get started on that disaster with that fighter and the evil\
  \ wizard. And if you happen to spot the agnoia aeon that's helping them—they're\
  \ about so tall, with three legs and three arms, hard to miss—please call one of\
  \ the local yamarajes to deal with it. I think that one is a little beyond your\
  \ just at the moment, and we don't want you meeting the Pale Lady too soon, after\
  \ all...</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderCampaignSetting/PZO92114-IllurishiProtean.jpg\"\
