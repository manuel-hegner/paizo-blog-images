  \    </div> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">As rare and special as it is to roll\
  \ a natural 20 in a Starfinder game session, the odds are just as good that you'll\
  \ roll a natural 1. Especially when it happens to the villains, spectacular failure\
  \ can just be fun, right?</p> \n    <p>Here at Paizo we think so, and we know that\
  \ can hold true whether you're watching a T-rexlike nyssholora miss so wildly with\
  \ its phasic claws that it swipes itself in the face, or you're seeing a rogue vlaka\
  \ technomancer's carefully selected spell turn into a completely random and catastrophically\
  \ unexpected effect right before your eyes.</p> \n    <p>The <a href=\"/products/btpzgd7u?Starfinder-Critical-Fumble-Deck\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Critical Fumble Deck</em></a> lets you impose these outrageous effects\
  \ and far more when the result of an attack roll is a natural 1. The deck includes\
  \ three variant rules for determining when an attack is a critical fumble, allowing\
  \ Game Masters and players to decide how often they want these unfortunate effects\
  \ to happen.</p> \n    <p>If you like lots of fumble effects in your game, use these\
  \ cards each time a natural 1 is rolled and the attack misses the enemy's AC. If\
  \ you want to impose fumbles sparingly, use the cards only when an attack roll is\
  \ a natural 1, it misses the enemy's AC, and the attacker is not proficient with\
  \ the weapon or is suffering from a condition that penalizes the attack roll.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Whichever way they're used, each card in the deck includes a critical\
  \ fumble effect for a kinetic attack, an energy attack, and a spell attack. A fourth\
  \ option, called an extreme effect, instead happens if the damage type, attack type,\
  \ or weapon category matches that effect's description.</p> \n    <p>For instance,\
  \ if you're throwing a grenade but you roll a natural 1 on the ranged attack, you\
  \ might throw the pin instead—and drop the grenade right at your own feet. If that\
  \ husk of a corpsefolk rolls a natural 1 with its static arc pistol, it might shock\
  \ itself with its own weapon, causing a random piece of its technological equipment\
  \ to stop working for 1d3 rounds.</p> \n    <p>If memorable dice rolls on the higher\
  \ end of the scale are more your speed—or you simply want to own the companion deck\
  \ to this set of fumbles—the <a href=\"/products/btpya17c?Starfinder-Critical-Hit-Deck\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Critical Hit Deck</em></a> offers hundreds of new critical hit results\
  \ that can be used to boost the breadth and impact of a natural 20. You can also\
  \ keep track of the most common conditions in the Starfinder Roleplaying Game with\
  \ our comically illustrated, full-color <a href=\"/products/btpy9s2d?Starfinder-Condition-Cards\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Condition Cards</em></a>.</p> \n    <p>Whether you've just landed\
  \ a sweet laser shot between your enemy's eyes or you've tripped over your own two\
  \ feet while squeezing the trigger, we've got you covered!</p> \n    <p>Amanda Hamon<br>\
