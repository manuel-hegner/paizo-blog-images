  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Ciravel’s first—and only—\
  childhood memory is of tasting the stars. Peering through a window into the depths\
  \ of space, innumerable galaxies stare back at her and glitter their welcome. She\
  \ remembers that moment, possibilities and potential branching like fractals, infinite\
  \ possibilities for infinite stars; and yet, six stars shine brightest of all. Someone\
  \ hands her something sweet that tastes of honey and spices, and the world smells\
  \ of citrus and the sea. Fragrance embraces her, the sweetness lingering upon her\
  \ tongue—the past and the present dancing together in a shared instant.</p> \n \
  \    <p>But before and after… Nothing. </p> \n     <p>And then, in some time or\
  \ none at all: heat, and the rain on Sovyrian’s canals.</p> \n     <p>Ciravel’s\
  \ young adulthood was spent at the university, where she earned impeccably high\
  \ marks studying xenobotany, while also attending martial arts and combat training.\
  \ Time rarely seemed to be the issue for Ciravel “But how do you manage it all?”\
  \ her classmates asked. Ciravel shrugged. “I plan well. I have to.”</p> \n     <p>And\
  \ she did need to plan. Multitudes of worlds and peoples mean multitudes of different\
  \ shapes, sizes, limb configurations, and body structures. For Ciravel, it meant\
  \ a body which, since birth, has been particularly responsive to varying gravities,\
  \ atmospheric pressures, and other planetary properties. Some days, and in some\
  \ places, Ciravel has little-to-no pain and walking isn’t a problem. Other times\
  \ or places, she manages exhaustion and pain. Like many others across the Pact Worlds\
  \ and beyond, using a hoverchair, or a cane for shorter distances, helps Ciravel\
  \ reduce fatigue and makes moving around less difficult and painful. She trained\
  \ to fight while using her chair, harnessing the thrusters and momentum to dodge\
  \ and attack, conserving energy, to use her cane to counterbalance and anchor herself.\
  \ Ways to minimize a bad day amongst the good and maximize a good day amidst the\
  \ bad. But never knowing what sort of day was ahead meant Ciravel had to learn early\
  \ how to plan for each possibility. So, she’d examine each potential outcome and\
  \ prepare for each iteration until it became instinctual.</p> \n     <p>After graduation,\
  \ Ciravel’s academic success in xenobotany caught the Sovyrian leadership’s attention,\
  \ and in time, she was trusted with occasional official journeys to Absalom Station.\
  \ Each time she boarded a starship, it felt more like home than Sovyrian ever had.\
  \ It was the end of one of these trips, heading back through the station towards\
  \ her waiting ship, that she was stopped in her tracks by the smell of crisp citrus\
  \ in the sea air. </p> \n     <p>It was a scent she had all but forgotten, and in\
  \ an instant, she was back in the memory of a window and stars and spiced honey.\
  \ And in that moment, existing in two times, simultaneously, she understood. She\
  \ could bend this moment to her needs. She could stretch time—delay her departure\
  \ long enough to find the source of the fragrance. It wouldn’t last long, and it’\
  d be exhausting, but it would be enough.</p> \n     <table class=\"image\" align=\"\

  \       </tr> \n      </tbody>\n     </table> \n     <br> \n     <p>She stretched\
  \ time at the docks and compressed it nearby. Following the fragrance, or perhaps\
  \ led by it, she found the source—a young woman with golden eyes and swirling tattoos\
  \ that almost seemed to dance, carrying a bundle under her arm and walking quickly\
  \ into a small temple with a shattered mirror on the door—the sign of the Gap Recollective.\
  \ Ciravel peered in, and when the woman drew back the cloth of the bundle, it revealed\
  \ a truly ancient warhammer engraved with glowing Dwarven runes. Ciravel tasted\
  \ spiced honey on her tongue. The young woman looked at her. Smiled. </p> \n   \
  \  <p>And Ciravel was suddenly back on the ship home.</p> \n     <p>Years went by,\
  \ and Ciravel became the default representative for most off-planet xenobotany meetings.\
  \ Her excursions were always on time, dodged inclement weather, and when her insular\
  \ life among the elves caused a diplomatic faux pas, it was somehow forgotten by\
  \ the next meeting. With the arrival of the <em>Idari</em>, Ciravel was invited\
  \ as part of the elven delegation to the kasathan worldship. She observed adat and\
  \ was awed to note that after death the kasatha, like she, exist in two aligned\
  \ points in time. She befriended one of the adata, who wore a pin engraved with\
  \ a circle and arrow containing a six-star constellation.</p> \n     <p>The six\
  \ stars from her memory.</p> \n     <p>The adata explained it as the symbol of Ibra,\
  \ The Inscrutable. Guardian of mysteries and miracles, of exploration and discovery\
  \ and the cosmos. They spoke at length of Ibra and cosmic enigmas swirling like\
  \ nebulas and questions, but eventually, Ciravel bid the adata farewell and boarded\
  \ the ship to Castrovel.</p> \n     <p>Another young woman boards Ciravel’s ship.\
  \ She smiles at Ciravel with golden eyes as an unfamiliar object peeks out from\
  \ the bundle tucked under a tattoo-adorned arm.</p> \n     <p>Citrus and spiced\
  \ honey and salt flood Ciravel’s senses. Time stops.</p> \n     <p>Ciravel tastes\
  \ the stars a third time. And this time, she understands.</p> \n     <p>Her memory\
  \ is of the Gap. And either this woman with the golden eyes or this strange object\
  \ is a link to it.</p> \n     <p>Ciravel untangles the possibilities—the present\
  \ and the future, selecting a strand, tracing it forward. She knows this woman,\
  \ Prindra, will lead Ciravel to the Gap Recollective on Castrovel. That Ciravel\
  \ will peer into the maelstrom of the Recollective’s esoteric secrets, and someone,\
  \ or something, will peer back. That they will hunt her, thinking three moves and\
  \ four dimensions ahead. Ciravel unknots another time-thread and finds people who\
  \ can help her, who she will help, who will become trusted companions. Ciravel knows\
  \ she will become Forlorn, but feels no despair, for she will bend time itself for\
  \ the friends she will make, keeping them safe on new worlds as they explore the\
  \ mysteries of the stars together. Invigorated, Ciravel takes these strands and\
  \ twists them together, weaving them into a new, stronger thread. Possibility.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>She peers out the window, smiling at galaxies glittering with infinite\
  \ potential and adventure and possibility, for Ciravel has time.</p> \n     <p>Despite\
  \ understanding and manipulating the mechanisms of time, Ciravel is by no means\
  \ omniscient. She selects the best plan based on the information she has on a given\
  \ topic, and even when she knows an outcome, she still gets nervous from time to\
  \ time. She also recognizes that someone may have information that informs a different\
  \ option than the one she has chosen, so, while she will defend her statements,\
  \ Ciravel is willing to follow another’s suggested plan. Her humor tends to be dry\
  \ and occasionally dark, but she is playful and loyal with people she trusts. </p>\
  \ \n     <p>Ciravel’s insular upbringing can manifest both as ignorance, condescension,\
  \ and elitism—she corrects inaccuracies, but lacks firsthand knowledge about much\
  \ of the galaxy, its peoples, their worlds, and their cultures, not for want of\
  \ curiosity, but simply from a lack of exposure—more than once, cultural ignorance\
  \ has put Ciravel into a sticky situation. She can be impatient and often will finish\
  \ others’ sentences, assuming she knows what they were going to say, and she’s usually\
  \ right. When all is said and done, there is nothing that thrills Ciravel more than\
  \ exploring the galaxy, putting together a puzzle, and staring out at the stars\
  \ with her friends.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p style=\"font-weight: bold;\
