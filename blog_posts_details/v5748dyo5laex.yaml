  artist: "more than 1 uses up an additional use of the ability for each level beyond\
    \ one (i.e., if you Empower a fireball, it would use up two uses of this ability).\
    \ Finally, you cannot add a metamagic feat to a spell using this ability if that\
    \ feat would have made the spell higher level than a level of spell that you are\
    \ capable of casting. I do want to take a moment to talk about some of the other\
    \ arcane schools before moving on to spells themselves. Many of the schools got\
    \ a bit of a revamp, most due to playtester feedback. Take the necromancy school\
    \ for example. The core power of this school now allows a necromancer to control\
    \ or turn undead (as per the feats) a number of times per day, meaning that a\
    \ necromancer does not necessarily have to be evil (the white necromancy option).\
    \ We also changed the way that wizards with an arcane school interact with their\
    \ prohibited schools. They can now learn and cast these spells just like any other\
    \ wizard; however, when they prepare them, spells"
