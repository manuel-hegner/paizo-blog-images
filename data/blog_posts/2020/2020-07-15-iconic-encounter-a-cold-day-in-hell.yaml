  >“COLLISION IN THIRTY SEC...” Keskodai punched a flashing button and the ship computer\
  \ fell silent, but the cockpit was still roaring from re-entry. From behind, he\
  \ heard the shrieking of metal as the ship’s rear quarter twisted into collapsing\
  \ fragments.</p>\n              <p><em>If I can just get the nose up. Iseph would\
  \ know what to do.</em> He was pathing now, as the only other living occupant of\
  \ the Hellknight ship shared his telepathy</p>\n              <p>Raia dropped into\
  \ the co-pilot seat next to him and began to struggle with the controls. <em>Surely,\
  \ this vessel must have an aerobraking system for safe landing in an emergency?</em></p>\n\
  \              <p><em>And I’d gladly use it, but all the controls are in devilspeak</em>!\
  \ Keskodai waved a hand over a control panel covered in infernal symbols.</p>\n\
  \              <p>Raia didn’t take her eyes off the viewscreen before her.<em> Perhaps\
  \ we should not have killed the entire crew</em>.</p>\n              <p><em>They\
  \ went to a Hell of their own making</em>. Keskodai stared helplessly at the controls.\
  \ <em>I’m just not ready to join them yet</em>.</p>\n              <p>Their thoughts\
  \ fell silent as the surface of the planet rumbled ever closer. The shaking front\
  \ viewscreen went yellow, then red, before their eyes; re-entry was melting the\
  \ ship. Beneath them, however, were endless fields of white, a thick blanket of\
  \ snow that rolled gently over hills and down into deep drifts.</p>\n          \
  \    <p><em>It must be one of those</em>, Raia pathed, pointing to a set of six\
  \ brilliantly flashing buttons on Keskodai’s side of the cockpit.</p>\n        \
  \      <p><em>But ... which?</em> He took a hand off the control wheel and hovered\
  \ over the array of buttons. Each bore indecipherable symbols. He felt himself overwhelmed\
  \ by the consequence of choice. How many chances would he have to activate the proper\
  \ system? If he picked the wrong one, would his choice doom the vessel, himself,\
  \ and Raia? Or could he try again? Was there some clue here in the cockpit, written\
  \ in letters that were twisted like fire but rigid like prison bars, that would\
  \ help him select the proper one? It was thrilling, this paralysis. And every moment\
  \ of indecision made the consequences vastly greater. His antenna twitched and shivered\
  \ in horrified delight.</p>\n              <p>Raia’s eyes were wide with fear. They\
  \ were less than a mile above the ground now, little more than a meteor adorned\
  \ with half-melted spikes. <em>Just pick one!</em></p>\n              <p>But he\
  \ could not move</p>\n              <p>At the last instant, she lunged across the\
  \ cockpit for the controls. Keskodai felt the braking thrusters fire, and they were\
  \ both hurled from their chairs towards the viewscreen.</p>\n              <p>Then\
  \ came blackness. And silence.</p>\n              <p>Raia awoke first. Everything\
  \ was tilted at an angle. Crumpled in the cockpit’s nose, she tried to move. Pain.\
  \ Broken shoulder. Her last healing serum... in her belt. Thinking was hard. But\
  \ as the fluid trickled down her throat her head cleared. She was alive.</p>\n \
  \             <p>Keskodai lay on the floor, in bad shape. His chitin was cracked.\
  \ She didn’t understand his biology but it wasn’t good. There was a box on the wall\
  \ with a red vial on its face; she didn’t need to read the Hellknights’ devil language\
  \ to recognize it as a first aid kit. Inside, a dermal stapler. The device made\
  \ a ka-lunk sound as she put Keskodai’s abdominal plates back together. She bit\
  \ the cap off a tube of sprayflesh and squeezed it out over the wound. It was all\
  \ she could do.</p>\n              <p>The cold wasn’t from her injuries. Hull plates\
  \ had separated in the descent, and a frigid wind outside blew snow sideways. She\
  \ thumbed her environmental protections and leapt out one of the holes, landing\
  \ in a knee-high drift.</p>\n              <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       \

  \ one, illustrated by Tomasz Chistowski—in <a href=\"“https://paizo.com/products/btq023hm?Starfinder-Starship-Operations-Manual“\
  \">Starfinder Starship Operations Manual</a>, available everywhere July 30.</p>\n\
  \              </div>\n              <p>The crash had attracted scavengers. Half\
  \ a dozen, each big as a shotalashu, with whip-like tails and massive lower jaws\
  \ ending in projecting tusks. “Calories must be exceptionally difficult to find\
  \ in this biome,” she said, not expecting them to respond. “So your hunger is understandable,\
  \ but you will find me more trouble than I’m worth.” Behind her, she heard Keskodai\
  \ climbing from the wreck.</p>\n              <p>Before the first one could lunge\
  \ for her, she hurled twin bolts of green force at it, and pieces of the creature\
  \ flew away into the freezing air, digitized into binary code. That surprised it,\
  \ but the others charged. Bringing her hands together, touching thumbs, she conjured\
  \ a fan of emerald flame and backed towards the ship. A white light spiraled out\
  \ from over her shoulder: Keskodai. His psychic blast overwhelmed one of the creatures;\
  \ it fell writhing in the snow, but the others were close now. She tried to levitate;\
  \ one of the creatures clamped down on her leg with its massive jaws and she cried\
  \ out as pain overwhelmed her. Desperate, she found her baton. It wouldn’t be enough.</p>\n\
  \              <p>But the frenzy abated. One of the animals sniffed the air, and\
  \ the pack made snuffling noises to each other. As Raia slowly slid down the side\
  \ of the hull into the snow, the beasts loped off.</p>\n              <p>Keskodai\
  \ lowered himself down and got an arm under Raia. <em>They can smell the Hellknight\
  \ corpses</em>, he told her. <em>Let’s hope they enjoy barbecue</em>.</p>\n    \
  \          <p><em>We only have a little time. If we have not found shelter by the\
  \ time they come back...</em> she winced as she tried to put weight on her leg.</p>\n\
  \              <p>Keskodai helped her to her feet, and they limped to the top of\
  \ a nearby hill. There wasn’t much to see, but a river of unnaturally dark blue\
  \ was barely visible in the distance. They made for it.</p>\n              <p>The\
  \ going was painful and slow. The snow stopped falling, but it was still thick and\
  \ the ground was impossible to see, until suddenly only Keskodai’s long antennae\
  \ were visible, the rest of him having fallen into a deep drift. It was growing\
  \ dark as they reached the river. Raia knelt down to cup the water. “Antifreeze,”\
  \ she said. It was the first they’d spoken since the attack. They couldn’t drink\
  \ this.</p>\n              <p>“You’re mad at me.” Keskodai indicated no emotion,\
  \ simply stating a fact.</p>\n              <p>“You shirren and your damn ... choice\
  \ paralysis!”</p>\n              <p>“I am sorry, Raia.”</p>\n              <p>“\
  My history teacher, Ms. Lueda, had a saying. ‘It is best to do the right thing.\
  \ Next best is to do something. Worst of all is to do nothing.’”</p>\n         \
  \     <p>“I said I was sorry.”</p>\n              <p>“Don’t they teach you anything\
  \ in school?”</p>\n              <p>“I did not go to school.”</p>\n            \
  \  <p>That made her pause. She couldn’t imagine it. “What?”</p>\n              <p>“\
  My parents carried me with them, day after day. I learned about life through their\
  \ experiences. Just as I carry Chk Chk.” He patted the armored cradle jar at his\
  \ hip.</p>\n              <p>“Wait, you brought your son <em>here</em>? Through\
  \ all,” she gestured in the vague direction of the crash and nearly stumbled. “\
  That?”</p>\n              <p>“How else is he to learn?”</p>\n              <p>Raia’\
  s leg was numb with pain. She was cold, but her environmental protections were running\
  \ fine. That meant it wasn’t the weather. Shock was getting to her. She couldn’\
  t stand any longer. Lowering herself to the river bank, she lay back in the snow.</p>\n\
  \              <p>Keskodai knelt down beside her.</p>\n              <p>Still angry,\
  \ she pulled away from him ever so slightly. “What are you doing?”</p>\n       \
  \       <p>“Healing your injuries.”</p>\n              <p>“You’re empty. We used\
  \ almost everything we had on the Hellknights, and the rest on those scavengers.”\
  </p>\n              <p>Was that a smile? Raia couldn’t tell. “See, this is where\
  \ your magic and mine differ,” he said, placing a hand on her head. It wasn’t the\
  \ leg that was killing her, he knew. It was head trauma from the crash. “So long\
  \ as I’m alive, I’m never empty.”</p>\n              <p>Her head began to clear.\
  \ But as it did, Keskodai’s green head gained ugly yellow bruises. Her leg stopped\
  \ hurting, but cracks appeared in his chitin. One of his antennae withered. She\
  \ lurched up, grabbing him, and emphatically pathed, Stop! He stopped.</p>\n   \
  \           <p>“You didn’t have to do that, you ridiculous...” She was speaking\
  \ again. “Why did you do that?”</p>\n              <p>Now it was Keskodai’s turn\
  \ to fall flat on his back in the snow. She didn’t know how much damage he had done\
  \ to himself, but it was serious. Maybe fatal. “It was easy,” he said. “There was\
  \ only one choice.”</p>\n              <p>Raia still had the dermal stapler. She\
  \ dug it out, gave it a quick whack to break the ice that had formed around the\
  \ dispenser, and started <em>ka-lunking</em> the shirren back together. He began\
  \ to make a noise, a rapid hk-ik-ikking noise.</p>\n              <p>“Are you laughing?\
  \ Because from my perspective none of this is particularly funny.”</p>\n       \
  \       <p>But he only rose a hand toward the sky. She looked over one shoulder.</p>\n\
  \              <p>The Sunrise Maiden emerged from the clouds. For the first time\
  \ in days, Raia smiled.</p>\n             </blockquote>\n             <p style=\"\
