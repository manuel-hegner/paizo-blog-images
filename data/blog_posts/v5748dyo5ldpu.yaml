  \ \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">As players and GMs familiar with the <a\
  \ href=\"/pathfinderSociety\">Pathfinder Society Organized Play</a> program surely\
  \ know after four full seasons of adventure, each year a new season of the campaign\
  \ launches at <a href=\"http://www.gencon.com\" target=\"nofollow\">Gen Con</a>,\
  \ and this year is no different. Over the last few seasons, we’ve worked to increase\
  \ the amount of continuity within the campaign such that each season has a clear\
  \ theme and plot arc, and so that participants in the campaign will be able to see\
  \ the effects of their actions as the campaign evolves over several years. I think\
  \ Season 4, which we’re calling the Year of the Risen Rune, will be the best season\
  \ yet!</span></p> \n    <p>The Year of the Risen Rune will take the focus of the\
  \ campaign to Varisia, land of ancient ruins, powerful magic, and political forces\
  \ competing for control of the largely untamed frontier region. We’ll visit such\
  \ classic Pathfinder locations as Korvosa, Riddleport, Magnimar, and Kaer Maga,\
  \ as well as places no published adventure has yet trod, including the dwarf city\
  \ of Janderhoff, the orc outcast city of Urglin, and unplumbed Thassilonian ruins\
  \ that have never been mentioned before. The Pathfinder Society will truly be exploring\
  \ uncharted territory.</p> \n    <p>The season will also see the return of several\
  \ ongoing villains, including the rogue Shadow Lodge dissidents who threatened the\
  \ entire society 2 years ago (and who were first encountered in Kaer Maga), the\
  \ Aspis Consortium, and several yet-to-be-revealed blasts from the campaign’s past.\
  \ There will also be new foes making life tough for Pathfinders, including the cult\
  \ of Lissala—forgotten goddess of runes, fate, and obedience—whose gift of rune\
  \ magic to Thassilon’s founder paved the way for the evil runelords to wrest control\
  \ of the ancient empire. The Year of the Risen Rune will culminate in a confrontation\
  \ with the campaign’s most dangerous and powerful threat yet, though who or what\
  \ that force of malevolence is will have to wait for a reveal later in the season.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>We’ll be debuting the season with four brand-new scenarios at Gen Con,\
  \ written by fan-favorite authors Matt Goodall, Mike Shel, Larry Wilhelm, and Dennis\
  \ Baker. Whether it’s <a href=\"/products/btpy8r0e\">Rise of the Goblin Guild</a>,\
  \ which pits the Pathfinders against the Pathfinder campaign setting’s most beloved\
  \ little psychopaths, or <a href=\"/products/btpy8r0c\">In Wrath’s Shadow</a>, in\
  \ which the PCs will explore an ancient ruin at the foot of Hollow Mountain, seat\
  \ of power of the Runelord of Wrath, there’ll be no shortage of potential adventure\
  \ for players at Gen Con.</p> \n    <p>And for over 500 participants in the annual\
  \ Pathfinder Society Special on Friday night, the 75-table event <a href=\"/products/btpy8r0d\"\
  >Race for the Runecarved Key</a>, Tim Hitchcock and Kyle Baird will pit teams against\
  \ one another to qualify for an exclusive second part of the event on Saturday night.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Check out a few pieces of art from these forthcoming scenarios to hold\
  \ you over for another two and a half weeks, and we’ll see you with your dice and\
  \ minis in hand on Thursday, August 16 at Gen Con Indy!</p> \n    <p style=\"clear:both;\"\
