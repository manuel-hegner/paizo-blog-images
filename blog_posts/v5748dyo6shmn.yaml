  description\">Have you ever had a beloved family pet expire due to old age, illness,\
  \ or getting hit by an errant enercycle? The Pet Revitalization Project (PRP) would\
  \ like to help return your best friend back to your side. This Eoxian company will\
  \ use special silicon-based technology to revitalize your pet, keeping their personality,\
  \ friendliness, and loyalty intact*. Many will find their pets stronger, more resilient,\
  \ and hardier than before revitalization; works great on guard animals!</p> \n \
  \    <p>Though this technology was previously only available to the richest and\
  \ most well connected individuals, new sources of resin and modern techniques have\
  \ driven the cost of revitalization down. The PRP would like to extend these savings\
  \ to you and your family. If you and your family are without the means to afford\
  \ pet revitalization, the PRP has set aside a fund to aid in the swift return of\
  \ your perished pet.</p> \n     <p>Pet revitalization is only viable for a short\
  \ time after a pet’s expiration without proper body preservation techniques, leading\
  \ some owners to preemptively revitalize their pets, ensuring their pets will remain\
  \ with them always. Don’t you want your best friend to be your best friend forever?\
  \ Contact the PRP today!</p> \n     <p>This message has been paid for by the Pact\
  \ Worlds Commission for Unliving Rights, the Eoxian General Council, and the Eoxian\
  \ Office of Pact Worlds Ambassadorship.</p> \n     <p>*Less than 10% of revitalized\
  \ animals experience side effects such as insatiable rage, unshakable ennui, or\
  \ empty compliance.</p> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/840a6ee1-5a09-48c2-8f08-72fb8eb88dfe/040921_RevitilizedPetSuox.jpg\"\

  \ solar battery (1 point), unliving</p> \n     <p><b>SPECIAL ABILITIES</b></p> \n\
  \     <p><b>Constructed Shell (Ex)</b> For effects targeting creatures by type,\
  \ a silicon mummy counts as both a construct and as undead (whichever type allows\
  \ an ability to affect them for abilities that affect only one type, and whichever\
  \ is worse for abilities that affect both types)</p> \n     <p><b>Silicon Casing\
  \ (Ex)</b> A silicon mummy’s protective exterior and nonfunctional organs limit\
  \ critical damage; the mummy has a 25% chance to ignore the extra damage dealt by\
  \ a critical hit and gains a +4 bonus to saves against critical hit effects.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>Solar Battery (Ex)</b> A silicon mummy can absorb solar energy in\
  \ the form of Solar Reserve Points (SRP), which they can spend in place of Resolve\
  \ Points. For every 8 hours a silicon mummy spends exposed to the light of a star,\
  \ the mummy gains 1 SRP, to a maximum number of SRPs equal to one-third their CR\
  \ (1 for a mummified prophet). For every week a silicon mummy absorbs no stellar\
  \ energy, they lose 1 SRP. However, the mummy can intentionally enter a state of\
  \ hibernation to lose only 1 point per 20 years, and although the mummy is aware\
  \ of their surroundings and can fully animate as a move action, they are staggered\
  \ for 1d4 hours afterward. As a swift action, a silicon mummy can expend 1 SRP to\
  \ enhance either their next melee attack, ranged attack, or spell before the end\
  \ of their turn. An enhanced attack gains a +2 circumstance bonus to its attack\
  \ roll and deals an additional 3d6 damage if it hits. An enhanced spell increases\
  \ the spell’s saving throw DC by 2.</p> \n     <p><b>Squox Tricks (Ex)</b> A squox\
  \ can use Acrobatics to jump instead of Athletics. In addition, a squox can use\
  \ its Acrobatics bonus as its attack bonus when it attempts a dirty trick, disarm,\
  \ or trip combat maneuver. If the squox succeeds at a dirty trick maneuver, it can\
  \ choose only between the entangled and off-target conditions. A squox’s tail, two\
  \ front paws, and mouth count as hands free for a disarm attempt.</p> \n     <h4>PLOT\
  \ HOOKS</h4> \n     <p>Game Masters might consider the following plot hooks as a\
  \ means of integrating a revitalized pet into any Starfinder game.</p> \n     <ul>\
  \ \n      <li>The PCs attempt to break into the home of a corporate executive, only\
  \ to find an augmented squox guarding the interior.</li> \n      <li>A PC takes\
  \ the Squox Companion feat, but later wants to ensure their little friend can survive\
  \ the rigors of higher-level combat.</li> \n      <li>Murders in an Aballonian archology\
  \ trace back to a group of silicon mummy animals, kept as house pets and guard animals\
  \ that have somehow formed a telepathic network and started to attack those who\
  \ would abuse them.</li> \n     </ul> \n    </blockquote> \n   </div> <!-- tags:\
