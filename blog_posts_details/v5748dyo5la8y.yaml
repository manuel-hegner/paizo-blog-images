  artist: "you, our ravenous readers: the bulette, illustrated here by Steve Prescott...\
    \ Of all the beasts that populate the wilderness, few are as feared as the bulette.\
    \ Known sometimes as the landshark, the bulette is a sleek predator, moving as\
    \ fluidly through earth as those primeval eating machines move through water.\
    \ Bulettes possess insatiable hunger and view anything that moves as food. They\
    \ hunt constantly, and when their attention turns to new hunting grounds they\
    \ feed until nothing remains. They are the stuff of nightmares, the bane of the\
    \ wildernessâ€”a brutal, savage monster whose ferocious majesty was not evolved,\
    \ but intentionally crafted. Vadid and Nahk Preview Purloiners"
