  \  </div>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\">The third part of the Season of Ghosts\
  \ Adventure Path, <em>No Breath to Cry</em>, both takes place during winter and\
  \ comes out as winter arrives for me and many other Paizo employees and freelancers!\
  \ Fortunately for most (hopefully all) of us, we won’t have to worry about the supernatural\
  \ threats that are coming to a head in the poor little town of Willowshore, during\
  \ which the story finally reaches its climax and the PCs must grapple with a revelation\
  \ that hopefully comes as a surprise to all who play this Adventure Path! As with\
  \ previous volumes, please make liberal use of spoilers if you’re talking about\
  \ this Adventure Path in public, because there are a LOT of plot twists to protect.\
  \ (In particular, I had to be very choosy with deciding what pieces of art to show\
  \ off in public this month! Fortunately, there was another cat illustration to share!)</p>\n\
  \      <p>The original plan to present Season of Ghosts as a four-part Adventure\
  \ Path was originally born out of a desire to set up the 200th volume of Pathfinder\
  \ as a special double-sized book (more on that in a few months), but now that Season\
  \ of Ghosts is coming out, I’m particularly pleased with two things that came about\
  \ because of this choice. First, it let me organize the Adventure Path according\
  \ to the four seasons, which gave the adventure authors some fun themes to work\
  \ with and encouraged everyone to come up with some memorable uses for downtime\
  \ in the campaign. Second, it let me structure the story using kishotenketsu (special\
  \ thanks again to James Case for the great suggestion)! This is a traditional four-act\
  \ story structure used in Chinese, Korean, and Japanese narratives in which the\
  \ major turning point/narrative crescendo/plot twist of the story happens not in\
  \ the final act, but the penultimate one. Hence my comment in the previous paragraph\
  \ about this adventure serving as Season of Ghosts’ climax! This gives us an entire\
  \ adventure (coming next month) to focus on the results and ramifications of the\
  \ story and wrap things up with some new and intense developments of their own,\
  \ resulting in what I think is not only a truly memorable campaign, but in what\
  \ is certainly one of the Adventure Paths I’m the proudest to have been a part of.\
  \ (And not just because it let me get a lot of cat artwork in print!)</p>\n    \

  \      <h3>Dan Cascone</h3>\n      <p>Hi everyone! I’m Dan Cascone, and I’ve crawled\
  \ out from under my rock to join Eleanor Ferron in writing <em>No Breath to Cry</em>.\
  \ You may remember me from contributions to books such as <em>Pathfinder Dark Archive</em>,\
  \ <em>Pathfinder Treasure Vault</em>, <em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Highhelm</em>, and\
  \ the upcoming <em>Pathfinder</em><em>Howl of the Wild</em>. I look forward to hearing\
  \ about all your horrible deaths and triumphant victories over the challenges we’\
  ve put in the adventure.</p>\n      <br>\n      <h3>Eleanor Ferron</h3>\n      <p>Hello!\
  \ I'm Lost Omens senior developer Eleanor Ferron, and I teamed up with co-author\
  \ Dan Cascone to write the third volume of the Season of Ghosts Adventure Path,\
  \ <em>No Breath to Cry</em>. As a fan of Asian horror and horror-adjacent media\
  \ such as <em>Onmyouji</em>, <em>Kuon</em>, and <em>Fatal Frame</em>, as well as\
  \ the supernatural shenanigans of <em>Inuyasha</em> and <em>Goblin: The Great and\
  \ Lonely God</em>, I enjoyed getting to bring all these inspirations into the world\
  \ of Pathfinder. I hope you survive your time in Willowshore, and hopefully even\
  \ have fun doing so. Be nice to foxes, don't go near the baskets, and always carry\
  \ a camera to catch ghosts.</p>\n      <br>\n      <h3>Michelle Y. Kim</h3>\n  \
  \    <p>Hi, this is Michelle! I’m a Korean American TTRPG writer and designer who\
  \ contributed some backmatter to Season of Ghosts, and I am so excited for you all\
  \ to meet some truly terrible little guys (and maybe not so little guys) in the\
  \ haunted lands of Shenmen. As a lover of both folklore and horror, this project\
  \ was a delight, and I look forward to hearing about everyone’s adventures. Currently\
  \ I'm working on a Joseon Dynasty setting supplement for <em>Good Society: A Jane\
  \ Austen RPG</em> by Storybrewers Roleplaying, which I talked a bit about on the\
  \ Asians Represent! Podcast. You can find me on Twitter as @_missmyk_ or at Bluesky\
  \ at @missmyk.bsky.social. I've recently joined the Paizo team as a developer and\
  \ will be helping create more wild adventures from the other side of the screen!</p>\n\
