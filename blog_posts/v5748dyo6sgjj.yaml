  \ the GAMA trade show. It is our chance to meet with many retailers and present\
  \ seminars on all things Paizo. We also have a booth on the exhibition floor where\
  \ attendees can try out the new <em>Starfinder Beginner Box</em>, talk with the\
  \ team about Pathfinder Second Edition and try a demo of the revised Adventure Card\
  \ Game. So far, feedback from the floor is highly receptive on all fronts.</p> \n\
  \     <p>Last week, the teaser at the end of the blog said we would be doing a preview\
  \ of Starfinder Society this week. We had a minor hiccup in getting a few things\
  \ processed before I left town, so instead of doing a partial writeup, I decided\
  \ to swap things around and present our plans for the Adventure Card Game this week\
  \ and wait on the Starfinder Society story blog until we could announce all the\
  \ information.</p> \n     <p>In looking at the revamp of the Pathfinder Adventure\
  \ Card Game and the new <em>Core Set</em>, we re-evaluated our presentation of the\
  \ Adventure Card Guild. Over the past few years, we tried using the Pathfinder Society\
  \ as an umbrella for both the Roleplay Guild and Card Guild. Our evaluation of our\
  \ methods showed that lumping the two together wasn't helping either program—the\
  \ cross-pollination of players we hoped for hadn't quite taken off. We decide that\
  \ since we have a dedicated community of card game players and a dedicated community\
  \ of roleplayers we should support communities on their own.</p> \n     <p>Going\
  \ forward, we are renaming the Pathfinder Adventure Card Guild (PACG) to the Pathfinder\
  \ Adventure Card Society (PACS), with a new logo based on the Pathfinder Adventure\
  \ Card Game logo. We tapped developer Linda Zayas-Palmer, familiar to many for her\
  \ work on Pathfinder Society, to oversee the playable content. And she has plans!</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Speaking of storylines, the Year of Tapestry's Tides ends at PaizoCon\
  \ (May 23-26). To support the new Core Set, we plan four short adventures to highlight\
  \ gameplay and bring people to the table. The planned release schedule is two at\
  \ PaizoCon and two at Origins (June 12-16). We will launch a new storyline at Gen\
  \ Con (Aug 1-4). Since the <em>Core Set</em> is a revised product, not a new game,\
  \ we are continuing our numbering cycle, so the Gen Con launch will be Year 6. I'm\
  \ not going to spoil the name or plot, though, as I think that is Linda's prerogative.\
  \ So, you'll have to keep an eye out for her blog for more card game news.</p> \n\
  \     <p>In regard to Gen Con, I'm busy entering event submission data. One change\
  \ to our usual structure. Besides having regularly scheduled sessions of the new\
  \ Year and demos of the <em>Core Set</em>, we will have older sets and scenarios\
  \ available for check out for any available tables. These events will accept generic\
  \ tickets, so if you find yourself with an extra hour between events, pop on by\
  \ and have a quick game.</p> \n     <p>Next week, join the developers for a sneak\
  \ peek into March's scenarios!</p> \n     <p>Until next time—Explore, Report, Cooperate!</p>\
