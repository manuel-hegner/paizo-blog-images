  \ \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Clerics are the first spellcasters to get a\
  \ preview, so you might want to look at <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkpv?All-About-Spells\"\
  >the blog about spells before you proceed</a>! We have a lot to say about this class,\
  \ so let's cut to the chase!</p> \n     <h2>Cleric Features</h2> \n     <p>Clerics'\
  \ key ability score is Wisdom. This means that they get an ability boost to Wisdom\
  \ at 1st level, increasing their Wisdom score by 2. They also use this key ability\
  \ to determine the DC of their spells. Like other things in the Playtest, spells\
  \ are also affected by your proficiency. Clerics are trained in divine spells, so\
  \ they add 10 + their level + their Wisdom modifier for their spell DC. They use\
  \ this same proficiency for touch attacks of their spells and for spell rolls.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>At 1st level, clerics get several class features, including their deity\
  \ and domain, anathema, channel energy, and of course, divine spellcasting (which\
  \ we'll talk more about in a bit). Your deity has a major impact on your character,\
  \ and you'll see a lot of similarities to Pathfinder First Edition, such as being\
  \ trained in your deity's favored weapon and getting access to one of their domains.\
  \ (Come back on Friday for a ton of detail about those parts of your character!)\
  \ Your choice of domain gives you a unique domain power. Powers are a special type\
  \ of spell that come only from your class, and are cast with Spell Points—think\
  \ of things from Pathfinder First Edition like domain powers or a wizard's school\
  \ powers. Powers are stronger than cantrips, but not as strong as your best spells.\
  \ A cleric's initial power costs 1 Spell Point to cast. She gets a starting pool\
  \ of Spell Points equal to her Wisdom, and can increase this by taking feats later\
  \ on. If she gets other ways to cast powers of a different type, she combines all\
  \ her Spell Points into one pool.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb360\">\n      <a\
  \ href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20180423-Kyra.jpg\"><img\

  ></a> \n      <p><i>Illustration by Wayne Reynolds</i></p>\n     </div> \n     <p>A\
  \ cleric's deity also imposes some restrictions on her, collectively called anathema,\
  \ representing acts that go against her deity's will and teachings or violate their\
  \ alignment requirements. Though we give some examples of anathemic acts for the\
  \ various gods and goddesses—like how it's anathema for a cleric of Sarenrae, goddess\
  \ of honesty, to cast a spell that would help her lie better—we wanted to leave\
  \ this broad enough that the GM and player can make the final say in how these work\
  \ in their games. Many other classes that follow similar restrictions have their\
  \ own anathema. Care to guess which ones those might be?</p> \n     <p>As you go\
  \ up in level, you'll increase your proficiency rank with divine spells to expert\
  \ at 12th level, master at 16th level, and legendary at 19th level.</p> \n     <h2>Divine\
  \ Spellcasting</h2> \n     <p>Of course, the cleric's main feature is her divine\
  \ spellcasting! At 1st level, you can cast two 1st-level spells each day, which\
  \ you prepare from the selections on the divine spell list. Every time you gain\
  \ an even level, you get one more spell slot per day of your highest level of spells\
  \ (so at 2nd level, a cleric has three 1st-level spells per day). At every odd level,\
  \ you get access to a new level of spells. You'll always be able to cast two or\
  \ three spells of your highest level and three spells of every lower level, plus\
  \ your cantrips and powers. Like your other spells, your 9th-level spells cap out\
  \ at three spells, so at 19th level you become legendary in spellcasting instead.\
  \ So what about your 10th-level spells? We'll talk about those in a future blog!</p>\
  \ \n     <p>We made your number of spells more straightforward by eliminating Pathfinder\
  \ First Edition's bonus spells granted for having a high ability score. Your Wisdom\
  \ still matters greatly for your spell DC and other things important to clerics,\
  \ but giving it slightly less weight makes it more practical now for you to play\
  \ a cleric of Gorum who focuses on Strength and uses spells that don't involve your\
  \ spell DC or that have decent effects even if your enemy succeeds at its save.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Now, it's not quite true to say those are all the spells you get. Remember\
  \ channel energy from earlier? This feature lets you cast <i>heal</i> or <i>harm</i>\
  \ an additional number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier! Moreover,\
  \ these spells are heightened to the highest level of spell you cast, so as soon\
  \ as you hit 3rd level, all those <i>heal</i> or <i>harm</i> spells become 2nd-level\
  \ spells. This replaces the Pathfinder First Edition cleric's spontaneous healing,\
  \ which required her to sacrifice her prepared spells to make room for a <i>heal</i>\
  \ spell. Now, you can use your channel energy to cast these extra <i>heal</i> spells,\
  \ and if you think you'll need more <i>heal</i>ing than this provides, you can always\
  \ prepare more <i>heal</i> spells using your normal spell slots (in fact, this can\
  \ be a good use of some of your lower-level slots as you go up in level). Your choice\
  \ of deity determines which spell you can cast with channel energy. Pharasma lets\
  \ you cast <i>heal</i>, Rovagug makes you cast <i>harm</i>, and someone like Abadar\
  \ or Lamashtu lets you choose your path at 1st level.</p> \n     <h2>Cleric Feats</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>As we've mentioned before, we always wanted Pathfinder Second Edition\
  \ to provide all classes with a sizeable number of options for customization. The\
  \ cleric was one of the classes that had the most to gain, since a cleric got a\
  \ bunch of class features at 1st level, then crickets for the rest of her career.\
  \ The cleric's new class feats give her all sorts of new flexibility, so let's look\
  \ at some of those!</p> \n     <p>At 1st level, you might pick Communal healing\
  \ so when you cast <i>heal</i> to tend to a creature other than yourself, you regain\
  \ some Hit Points too, or you might take Turn Undead, which forces undead that critically\
  \ fail their saves against your <i>heal</i> spells to flee from you. (This works\
  \ great with the 3-action version of <i>heal</i>!) You could also pick Expanded\
  \ Domain to explore your deity's domains further, gaining the initial power from\
  \ a different domain than the first one you chose. You can select this feat twice,\
  \ letting you delve into a maximum of three domains!</p> \n     <p>At higher levels,\
  \ you gain new cleric feats at every even level, except levels 12 and 16, when you\
  \ increase your spell DCs instead. At 4th level, you might pick up Advanced Domain\
  \ to gain the advanced power from one of your domains. At 8th level, if you channel\
  \ positive energy, you could take the Channeled Succor feat so you can cast <i>remove\
  \ curse</i>, <i>remove disease</i>, <i>remove paralysis</i>, or <i>restoration</i>\
  \ with your channeled energy spells instead of just <i>heal</i>.</p> \n     <p>Let's\
  \ take a look at a category of feats clerics have plenty of: metamagic! You can\
  \ activate a metamagic feat when you cast a spell. This increases the number of\
  \ actions required to cast the spell and modifies the spell in some way. At 1st\
  \ level, for example, you could select Reach Spell to let you add a Somatic Casting\
  \ action to a spell and increase its range by 30 feet (or to make a touch spell\
  \ into a ranged touch spell with a 30-foot range). This is a metamagic feat lots\
  \ of spellcasters can take, but the cleric gets some others that are more specific\
  \ to her as well. Command Undead, a 4th-level feat, lets you change the effects\
  \ of any <i>harm</i> spell you cast to instead take control of an undead creature.\
  \ Heroic Recovery, an 8th-level feat, adds a powerful buff to <i>heal</i> spells:\
  \ you can target one creature at range using 3 actions (the 2-action version of\
  \ <i>heal</i>, plus another action to activate the metamagic) to <i>heal</i> them\
  \ for a solid number of hit points and also give them a bonus to attack and damage\
  \ rolls and a 5-foot increase to its speed for 1 round. And if you use a lot of\
  \ metamagic, the 20th-level cleric feat Metamagic Channeler is a great choice—it\
  \ lets you apply a metamagic feat to a <i>harm</i> or <i>heal</i> spell without\
  \ adding an action to its casting!</p> \n     <p>So what are your favorite parts\
  \ of the new cleric? Any builds you're itching to try out? How about concepts you\
  \ made in Pathfinder First Edition you'd like to take another shot at?</p> \n  \
