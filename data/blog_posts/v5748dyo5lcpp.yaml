  \   <p>I was always taught to deal with bad news first and then move on to good\
  \ news. It is with a heavy heart that I announce the resignation of Doug Miles,\
  \ the Detroit Venture-Captain. Doug was Pathfinder Society’s first five-star GM.\
  \ He has been an avid supporter of Pathfinder Society and he will be sorely missed.\
  \ I had the pleasure of meeting and GMing side by side with Doug at Dragon Con two\
  \ years ago and was able to take some observations of watching his GMing style and\
  \ incorporate it into my own. On a positive note, Doug has some very exciting life\
  \ changes he is preparing for in the near future and the Paizo and Pathfinder Society\
  \ wish him well.</p> \n    <p>\"It's been a privilege to see Pathfinder Society\
  \ grow year after year, and to have promoted a game that has exceeded expectations\
  \ on so many levels,” said Miles. “If it weren't for the support and encouragement\
  \ of the players and GM volunteers in this campaign, I would have never come as\
  \ far as I have. I am most grateful for all the friends that I have made through\
  \ the campaign, both in person and on the messageboards. Although I can no longer\
  \ live up to my Venture-Captain obligations, and thus am stepping down, I hope to\
  \ stay in touch with PFS and look forward to watching its popularity continue to\
  \ expand.\"</p> \n    <p>It also saddens me to announce we are losing another member\
  \ of the Venture-Captain team in Mark Garringer from Indianapolis.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Due to family and personal reasons, I have to take a step back from my involvement\
  \ in Pathfinder Society,\" said Garringer. \"I believe in organized play and where\
  \ Mike is taking things, and I want to thank him for all he has done already. I\
  \ thank Paizo for the opportunity and friendships I've been able to make.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>This is not the only change to our existing Venture-Captain corp. Bob\
  \ Jonquet is moving south of Chicago to the southern area of Illinois. This does\
  \ create additional opportunities for Pathfinder Society, however, as I have created\
  \ a new region—Central &amp; Southern Illinois. Bob has been named the Venture-Captain\
  \ of this new region and I look forward to seeing how he can grow Pathfinder Society\
  \ in a new area.</p> \n    <p>A final change to our existing Venture-Captains is\
  \ the stepping down of Dane Pitchford in Seattle. Due to his life becoming even\
  \ more busy and hectic, he did not feel he could devote as much time to the position\
  \ as it deserves. I did not want to lose Dane from the Venture-Captain family and\
  \ so I offered him a new position that he graciously accepted. He has been reassigned\
  \ to his new position, Venture-Lieutenant (Seattle).</p> \n    <p>We are also adding\
  \ 13 new Venture-Captains in 10 new regions! Please welcome the following:</p> \n\
  \    <p>Boise, Idaho – Clarence Garrett<br> Portland, Oregon – Alex Greenshields<br>\
  \ Las Vegas, Nevada – Doug Daulton<br> Seattle, Washington – Chris Jarvis<br> Salt\
  \ Lake City, Utah – Eddy &amp; Stephanie Roberts<br> Central/Southern Illinois –\
  \ Bob Jonquet<br> Chicago, Illinois – Rene Duquesnoy<br> South Carolina – Del Collins<br>\
  \ Wisconsin – Sean Hanlin<br> Winnipeg, Canada – Scott Young<br> Perth, Australia\
  \ – Callum Prior<br> Sydney, Australia – Alistair Rigg<br> Croatia, Slovenia, and\
  \ Bosnia – Zrinka Znidarcic</p> \n    <p>For another exciting change, I am also\
  \ instituting the Venture-Lieutenant program. As Venture-Captain in Atlanta, I learned\
  \ quickly I could not run everything on my own. Trying to spread myself among nine\
  \ stores, with more than 240 square miles, and still maintain a life was impossible.\
  \ So, I choose to handpick store liaisons, or Venture-Lieutenants, to help me. They\
  \ were my right-hand people who helped me ensure Pathfinder Society continued to\
  \ grow, while meeting these needs of the players in the different stores. Each was\
  \ assigned to a store or area in Georgia I could not get to regularly. This paid\
  \ huge dividends in that we had tremendous growth in the region.</p> \n    <p>So,\
  \ I have worked with the Venture-Captains to choose Venture-Lieutenants to assist\
  \ them in their regions. If the region is spread out among many miles, or has more\
  \ game locations than they can handle, I have let the Venture-Captains choose two\
  \ Venture-Lieutenants to assist them.</p> \n    <p>This is not an inclusive list\
  \ as more will be added, but as of the writing of this blog, the following have\
  \ been chosen as Venture-Lieutenants:</p> \n    <p>Arizona – Jason Leonard<br> Atlanta,\
  \ GA – Joseph Caubo and John Compton<br> Austin, TX – Bill Oppenlander<br> Chicago,\
  \ IL – Garret Gottschalk<br> Dallas/Ft. Worth, TX – Marcus Mayes<br> Des Moines,\
  \ IA – Derek Boobyer<br> Denver, CO – Scott Crosson<br> Dunedin, FL – Kristy Schweyer<br>\
  \ Indianapolis, IN – Tracy Windeknecht<br> Missouri – Michael Von Hasseln<br> Omaha,\
  \ NE – Clint Blome<br> Raleigh, NC – Joe Jungers<br> Seattle, WA – Dane Pitchford<br>\
  \ Toronto, Canada – Robert Trifts<br> Winnipeg, Canada – Myron Pauls<br> Croatia\
  \ – Maja Skvorc</p> \n    <p>Each of these new Venture-Lieutenants, as well as any\
  \ chosen in the future, will receive a messageboard title to identify him or her\
  \ as such. It is encouraged that you still work with your regional Venture-Captain\
  \ for all of your Pathfinder Society needs.</p> \n    <p>We are still in need of\
  \ additional Venture-Captains in some regions and you can find the list <a href=\"\
  /cgi-bin/WebObjects/Store.woa/wa/browse?path=pathfinderSociety%2Fabout%2FregionalCoordinators\"\
  >here</a>. If interested in applying, please contact me after reviewing the application\
  \ process in the previous link.</p> \n    <p>Good-bye to an old friend and welcome\
  \ aboard to all my new captains and lieutenants!</p> \n    <p>Mike Brock<br> <i>Pathfinder\
  \ Society Campaign Coordinator</i></p> \n   </blockquote> <!-- tags: Pathfinder\
