  \ Starfinder classes, the solarian is the one hardest to explain in 10 words or\
  \ less. It is a new class, and a new concept, unique to Starfinder though clearly\
  \ inspired by various iconic science-fantasy tropes. It can be described as a kind\
  \ of supernatural philosopher-warrior, with a focus on the stellar powers of light\
  \ and gravity, but that doesn't give a very good idea of what the class can actually\
  \ do. For starters, let's take a look at what the <a href=\"/products/btpy9tqw?Starfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Subscription\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em></a> has to say about the solarian.</p> \n   \
  \ <blockquote> \n     <p><i>The stars guide the planets with gravity, create life\
  \ with light and heat, and utterly consume worlds in supernovas and black holes.\
  \ You understand that these acts of creation and destruction are not opposites,\
  \ but rather two parts of a natural, dualistic cycle. You seek to be an agent of\
  \ that cycle, an enlightened warrior with the ability to manipulate the forces of\
  \ the stars themselves. Constantly accompanied by a mote of fundamental energy or\
  \ entropy, you can shape this essence in combat to create weapons and armor of gleaming\
  \ stellar light or pure, devouring darkness. Whether you apprenticed in a temple\
  \ or came to your powers through personal revelation, you recognize yourself as\
  \ part of an ancient tradition—a force of preservation and annihilation.</i></p>\
  \ \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>The cycle that empowers and guides solarians is a\
  \ philosophy that came to the Pact Worlds on the <i>Idari</i>, along with the tradition\
  \ of the solarians themselves. Even now, nearly a century after the kasatha worldship's\
  \ arrival in system, solarians are more commonly kasatha than any other race (though\
  \ certainly there are other solarian traditions, as they can even be found in systems\
  \ with no contact with Kasath).</p> \n    <p>The solarian has a full base attack\
  \ bonus, good Fortitude and Will saves bonuses, 4 skill points per level, and 10\
  \ fixed class skills. At 1st level, a solarian gains the skill adept ability, which\
  \ represents training gained in the process that led to a character becoming a solarian\
  \ and which grants two more class skills of the player's choice. A solarian has\
  \ proficiency with light armor, and proficiency and eventually specialization with\
  \ small arms and basic and advanced melee weapons.</p> \n    <p>Also at 1st level,\
  \ a solarian gains a solar manifestation, and access to stellar modes. The solar\
  \ manifestation is a physical representation of the solarian's stellar powers. When\
  \ not in use, it is a mote of energy slightly smaller than a fist that glows with\
  \ light (or is the black of perfect darkness) and hovers near the solarian's head.\
  \ When activated, the mote becomes either a solar weapon (which is treated as an\
  \ advanced melee weapon, deals damage that increases as the solarian gains levels,\
  \ and can be further augmented through the addition of solarian weapon crystals),\
  \ or solar armor (which enwraps and protects the solarian, augmenting the AC bonus\
  \ of any light armor the solarian wears and at higher levels giving cold or fire\
  \ resistance).</p> \n    <p>Stellar modes are forms of attunement the solarian can\
  \ focus on in combat. Each round in a fight, the solarian can remain unattuned,\
  \ or increase either photon attunement or graviton attunement, depending on whether\
  \ the solarian wishes to draw on the stellar powers of light and heat and life-giving\
  \ energy, or darkness and gravity and all things being bound together. Every solarian\
  \ has access to both photon and graviton powers (and gains more via stellar revelations\
  \ as he gains levels), and can use either even regardless of attunement—though many\
  \ powers gain additional effects if the solarian is attuned to their power source.\
  \ For example, a solarian with the 6th-level corona photon power gains cold resistance,\
  \ and deals fire damage to any adjacent foe that strikes the solarian with a melee\
  \ weapon. However, if the solarian is photon attuned, the corona also causes any\
  \ creature that begins its turn adjacent to the solarian to automatically take some\
  \ fire damage. While some stellar revelations can only target creatures once a day,\
  \ or only under specific situations, in general there's no limit to how often a\
  \ solarian can use the powers tied to their stellar modes.</p> \n    <p>After 3\
  \ rounds of attunement to exclusively photon or graviton powers, a solarian can\
  \ reach full attunement, which grants access to zenith powers. Each solarian begins\
  \ play with two zenith powers: black hole, which draws a foe closer to you, and\
  \ supernova, which does fire damage to everyone within 10 feet of you. Using a zenith\
  \ power causes you to be unattuned afterwards, so zenith powers can be used at most\
  \ once every few rounds. However, in general there's no other limitation to how\
  \ often a solarian can use these powers in combat—if a fight lasts long enough to\
  \ keep cycling through zenith powers, the solarian is free to do so.</p> \n    <p>While\
  \ the choice of solar armor or solar weapon and selection of different stellar revelations\
  \ are the primary customization options for a solarian, they have a few other minor\
  \ abilities at well. At 3rd level a solarian gains sidereal influence, which allows\
  \ the solarian to meditate to gain bonuses to photon- and graviton-related skills.\
  \ At 7th level, a solarian gains flashing strikes, which allows them to make a full\
  \ attack entirely with melee weapons at a reduced attack penalty, and at 13th level\
  \ a solarian's onslaught allows their full attack to be three attacks rather than\
  \ the normal two (though all three attacks are at a slightly higher penalty). At\
  \ 20th level, a solarian gains full attunement in a stellar mode more quickly, can\
  \ switch from one full attunement to another, and even spend 1 Resolve to immediately\
  \ become fully attuned.</p> \n    <p>Given the importance of stellar modes and stellar\
  \ revelations, here are two sample revelations.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><b>Blazing\
  \ Orbit (Su) [6th level photon revelation]</b> As a move action, you can move up\
  \ to your speed, gaining concealment against any attack made against you during\
  \ the move, and you can leave a trail of flames in every square you pass through.\
  \ The flames last for 1 round and deal 2d6 fire damage to anyone who moves into\
  \ them. You can't move through another creature's space during this movement. If\
  \ you use blazing orbit again, any flames you previously created with it go out.\
  \ The damage from the flames increases by 1d6 at 8th level and every 2 levels thereafter.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>When you are attuned or fully attuned, any creature damaged by the flames\
  \ also gains the burning condition (1d6 fire damage; see page 273).</p> \n     <p><b>Crush\
  \ (Su) [6th level graviton revelation]</b> As a standard action, you can increase\
  \ the effects of gravity on the internal organs or workings of a target within 30\
  \ feet, causing it to have difficulty maintaining its normal functionality. The\
  \ target must succeed at a Fortitude save or become staggered for 1 round. This\
  \ revelation also affects constructs. You can maintain this effect as a move action\
  \ each round, but the target can attempt a new saving throw each round to end the\
  \ effect. Once a creature succeeds at this save or the effect ends, you can't target\
  \ that creature with crush again for 24 hours.</p> \n     <p>When you are attuned\
  \ or fully attuned, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to also stun the target for 1\
  \ round. Maintaining crush on subsequent rounds extends the staggered effect, but\
  \ not the stunned effect.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Owen KC Stephens<br>\
