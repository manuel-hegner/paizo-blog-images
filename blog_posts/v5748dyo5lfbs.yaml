  >I can hardly believe it's already Friday again. It seems like only yesterday I\
  \ was writing last week's preview blog, but that's life at Big Gaming. There's always\
  \ so much cool stuff coming across my desk that whole weeks seem to go by in a flash.\
  \ It's a good problem to have, though, so enough complaining. Let's get onto the\
  \ main event, a preview of December's <a href=\"/products/btpy91sj\">Red Dragon\
  \ Evolution</a> Encounter Pack!</span></p> \n    <p>I've mentioned it a few times\
  \ in this space before, but when it comes to producing plastic gaming miniatures,\
  \ the most difficult aspect to master by far is SCALE. Compare, for example, the\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy8qjj\">Troll</a> from our first set, <a href=\"/products/btpy8mq6\"\
  >Heroes &amp; Monsters</a>, to the recent <a href=\"/products/btpy91lq\">Sea Troll</a>\
  \ from <a href=\"/products/btpy8xg6\">Skull &amp; Shackles</a>. The latter is the\
  \ \"correct\" size for a standard troll, whereas the former is pretty runty by comparison.\
  \ We've been learning as we go on the line, and over several sets there's been a\
  \ bit of inflation in size, particularly for Large-sized figures. Even mighty dragons\
  \ have been bit by the size bug a time or two.</p> \n    <p>For example, compare\
  \ the Large <a href=\"/products/btpy8sfq\">Young Red Dragon</a> from <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8rqs\">Rise of the Runelords</a> (our second set) to most other Large\
  \ figures produced since. He's a bit small by today's standards.</p> \n    <p>When\
  \ it comes to the Dragon Evolution Encounter Packs for Pathfinder Battles, we often\
  \ try to include at least one repaint of a previously released dragon to help keep\
  \ costs manageable and keep the final retail price under $40. For <a href=\"/products/btpy8yj4\"\
  >White Dragon Evolution</a> the \"reused\" miniature was the Huge White Dragon,\
  \ which originally was to appear in <a href=\"/products/btpy8rqs\">Rise of the Runelords</a>,\
  \ but from a production perspective, that one was already in the can even if none\
  \ of you had seen it yet.</p> \n    <p>For the <a href=\"/products/btpy91sj\">Red\
  \ Dragon Evolution</a> set, I knew WizKids would want to include at least one re-used\
  \ sculpt, and the only option available to us was the Young Red Dragon from Rise\
  \ of the Runelords. I knew, however, that if I could get two new sculpts out of\
  \ WizKids, I'd end up with much better figures if I let them unleash their sculpting\
  \ magic on larger figures, so the decision to change sizes seemed like the smartest\
  \ thing to do.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71293-Medium.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71293-Medium_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Here we have the new version, which is called the\
  \ Medium Red Dragon. His new paint scheme is a bit brighter than the previous version,\
  \ and some of the coloring on his chest, tail, and legs varies a bit from the previous\
  \ incarnation. As you can see, the figure now stands upon a Medium base, which fits\
  \ his feet and overall body quite well. There's a bit of overhang on the wings,\
  \ which is something we generally try to avoid, but in this case I think the trade-off\
  \ was well worth it, because it allowed for two awesome new figures like this one:</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71293-Large.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71293-Large_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>This stunning Large Red Dragon stands on all four\
  \ legs, looking like he just stepped off of one of Ben Wootten's illustrations.\
  \ The Large Red Dragon makes full use of the Large base without seeming oversized,\
  \ and the detail on his back spikes, wing, and face make for an excellent and imposing\
  \ figure. </p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71293-Huge.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71293-Huge_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Finally here is the coolest piece in the box, the\
  \ terrifying Huge Red Dragon! This draconic tyrant stands taller than the huge in\
  \ the <a href=\"/products/btpy8yj4\">White Dragon Evolution</a> set, and is clearly\
  \ the big dog among his (or is it her?) fellow reds in this box. With an open mouth\
  \ that seems to be saying \"You're fired!\" and a hateful look in its eyes, this\
  \ dragon truly is a sight to behold.</p> \n    <p>And there you have it. Three red\
  \ dragons for $39.99. Don't forget that folks with a <a href=\"/products/btpy8o6b\"\
