  \ <blockquote> \n   <h1>New Pathfinder Web Fiction!</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\"\
  >Wednesday, August 18, 2010</p> \n   <p>If you're reading this blog on paizo.com,\
  \ rather than aggregating through some sort of high-tech feed to your personal mobile\
  \ command unit, or beaming it directly to your personal communications satellite—\
  as one of the last Paizonians without a smart phone, I really have no idea what\
  \ such things are capable of these days—it's likely you've already seen the little\
  \ tab just above this that says \"Web Fiction.\" And if you're a fan of freebies,\
  \ you've probably even checked it out, and already read through the excellent free\
  \ Pathfinder Tales stories by folks like Dave Gross, Rich Ford, and J. C. Hay.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Yet while the fiction itself is easy to find, it's come to my attention\
  \ that people might not know that new installments in our free fiction series go\
  \ live <i>every single Wednesday</i>, with several thousand words of new free content\
  \ each week! Perhaps even more importantly, I've realized that while we've been\
  \ slaving away bringing you the stories, we've been totally bereft of a forum in\
  \ which to tell you about them.</p> \n   <p>All of which stops today! Going forward,\
  \ I'm going to make it my mission to announce each new story on this blog as it\
  \ launches, the better to preview things for you and let you know what's coming\
  \ down the line. And as it turns out, I couldn't have picked a better time to start.\
  \ (Well, except for the very beginning, but that's beside the point.) </p> \n  \
  \ <p>This week sees the first installment of \"Certainty,\" a new story from up-and-coming\
  \ fantasy novelist Liane Merciel. The author of <i>The River Kings' Road</i> and\
  \ its forthcoming sequel, Liane really understands how to bring some grit and realism\
  \ to a fantasy world. Fortunately for us, she's also a fan of Pathfinder, with a\
  \ grasp of the history and feel of the setting that's simply astounding. In the\
  \ new story, Liane follows Ederras, a former paladin of Iomedae who's lost his faith\
  \ (or at least, his self-righteous conviction), on his journey to the Worldwound\
  \ to reclaim a sense of right and wrong—or die trying. But it turns out that even\
  \ in Mendev, light and dark aren't always clear, and the hand that smites the demon\
  \ might be just as corrupt, in its own fashion, as the demon itself...</p> \n  \

  \ in this new free short story, and don't forget to check back every Wednesday for\
  \ more adventures on Golarion!</p> \n   <p>James Sutter <br>Fiction Editor</p> \n\
