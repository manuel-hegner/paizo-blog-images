  description\">For those inducted into the faith of Pharasma, the Lady of Graves,\
  \ death is not an ending, but a doorway: an entry into a new existence and way of\
  \ being. The shirren Keskodai understands this transition well, and greets it with\
  \ the joyful reverence it deserves—an outlook that's not always comforting to the\
  \ patients in his medical bay.</p> \n      <p>Keskodai grew up in the burning deserts\
  \ of Fullbright, the side of tidally locked Verces that's always turned toward the\
  \ sun. Though cosmopolitan, his hometown of Takoris was primarily shirren, having\
  \ been an early satellite settlement of the original shirren colony on that world.\
  \ The child of a priest of Hylax, the Forever Queen, Keskodai grew up steeped in\
  \ the values of friendship and diplomacy, and felt a deep connection to the divine,\
  \ yet chafed at the idea of serving the same god as his parent. Exactly which god\
  \ he'd serve instead remained unclear, until the coming of the Gray Shakes.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Believed to be the result of a biotech experiment gone wrong at the\
  \ local university, the plague called the Gray Shakes burned through the city like\
  \ a wildfire, turning shirrens' chitin gray, rotting off their antennae, and eating\
  \ away at their telepathy and motor function, leaving them awake but unable to communicate\
  \ until they finally expired. In the weeks it took the local government to find\
  \ a cure, thirty percent of the city's shirren population died.</p> \n      <p>In\
  \ the midst of this horror, a young Keskodai first encountered priests of Pharasma,\
  \ black-robed beings of all different races who'd come at news of the plague. Somberly,\
  \ the Pharasmins walked among the afflicted, offering magical healing where they\
  \ could and comfort to those too far gone, whispering to them of the Cycle of Souls\
  \ and the new worlds that awaited them. The beauty of their ministry moved Keskodai,\
  \ and he quickly joined their hospice work, leaving home to study at a temple in\
  \ the Ring of Nations once the plague was safely contained.</p> \n      <p>After\
  \ years as an initiate, Keskodai returned home a full priest of Lady of Graves,\
  \ ready to tend to his people. He quickly fell in love with two members of his congregation,\
  \ a female-host couple, and the three soon joined arms in marriage. Yet as much\
  \ as he loved his community and his partners, a part of him remained unsatisfied.\
  \ That part of every shirren that thrills at choice and decision-making began to\
  \ wonder: Had he made the right choice in coming home? In choosing a life so similar\
  \ to his parent? How could he know if he wanted this when there was still so much\
  \ out there that he'd never experienced? The desire to explore continued to grow,\
  \ until at last, after the birth of their first son, he and his partners sat down\
  \ and made a plan. He would leave and see the galaxy, taking their child with him\
  \ to expose him to the same new experiences. Once the child was old enough to leave\
  \ his cradle-jar, Keskodai would decide whether he'd seen enough to return in good\
  \ conscience, in which case both of them be welcomed with open arms. If not, the\
  \ child would return alone.</p> \n      <p>In his effort to see as many worlds as\
  \ possible, Keskodai took to signing on with freelance adventurers and starship\
  \ crews, particularly those headed out beyond the edges of the solar system. While\
  \ quite capable in combat, he prefers to act as the ship's medic, trusting that\
  \ his mercenary companions will give him plenty of opportunities to employ his goddess-granted\
  \ magic in patching up the broken or blessing them on their journey into the Great\
  \ Beyond. The cheerful manner in which he talks about death often initially disturbs\
  \ those under his care, yet anyone who spends much time with the shirren quickly\
  \ learns that his even-keeled, fatalistic approach to life and death doesn't make\
  \ him cavalier about it: for him, to give less than his best effort in healing his\
  \ friends would be to risk them dying before their appointed time—a loss for him,\
  \ and a grave failure in his duty to his goddess.</p> \n      <p>As with many shirren,\
  \ Keskodai is a team player, always ready to throw in to help others, and a social\
  \ butterfly who loves meeting new people. A crewmate once called him \"the galaxy's\
  \ friendliest death priest,\" and he wears the badge with pride. Though quite fond\
  \ of option bars and other artificial means of stimulating his choice centers, he's\
  \ careful not to let himself overindulge... usually. More often he satisfies his\
  \ need for independence by customizing his gear—though he doesn't consider himself\
  \ vain, Keskodai is intensely proud of the aesthetics of his gear, his collection\
  \ of trophies, and his mustache (which he thinks lends him an air of gravitas).\
  \ His greatest pride, however, is his son Chkoresk, still in his larval stage. Like\
  \ many shirren parents, Keskodai constantly carries Chkoresk—affectionately nicknamed\
  \ \"Chk Chk\"—around in a heavily fortified cradle-jar designed to let Chk Chk learn\
  \ about the world from relative safety. While Chk Chk isn't old enough to speak\
  \ yet, his telepathy only good enough to grant brief blasts of childlike emotion,\
  \ Keskodai holds conversations with him regularly, with Chk Chk tapping on the glass\
  \ to communicate his answers.</p> \n      <p>Though Keskodai is generally as easygoing\
  \ as he appears, he still has his demons. The Gray Shakes tragedy left him deeply\
  \ distrustful of certain types of research and technology, and he's constantly torn\
  \ between his faith in individual freedom and his desire to protect the community\
  \ through heavy government regulation. Worse, he's come to love the life of a wanderer\
  \ and the friends he's made along the way, and deeply fears the day when Chk Chk\
  \ grows old enough to return home, and Keskodai has to choose whether to head back\
  \ to Verces with him, or continue on alone.</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>James\
