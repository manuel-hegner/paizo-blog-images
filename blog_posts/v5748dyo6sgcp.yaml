  \ \n    <p>A new update to the <a href=\"/products/btpy9vlp?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Guide\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild Guide</em></a> is due... well, right now!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>That's right. <span itemprop=\"description\">As of now, the guide has\
  \ been updated to include a variety of updates put together by the Organized Play\
  \ Team and built from the feedback of countless players and organizers across the\
  \ world. I'd like to also give a special thanks to anyone who contributed to the\
  \ thread that was started months ago on this topic as your comments were invaluable\
  \ in coming up with these updates.</span></p> \n    <p>So, let's hop into a summary\
  \ of the major changes:</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\"> <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7107-DataJockey.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7107-DataJockey_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n    </div> \n    <ul>\n     <li>A new playable faction has been included:\
  \ the Second Seekers loyal to First Seeker Jadnura. This includes a table of associated\
  \ boons, including numerous new boons unique to this faction.</li> \n     <li>The\
  \ list of always available playable races has been expanded to include the legacy\
  \ races included in the <em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em>.</li> \n     <li>The required\
  \ resources necessary to create a character of a new race have been clarified to\
  \ accommodate special rules reference handouts included in certain scenarios.</li>\
  \ \n     <li>The rebuilding rules for characters and personal boons has been clarified.</li>\
  \ \n     <li>Numerous faction-associated boons have been clarified or expanded,\
  \ including hirelings, basic purchases, and improved faction champion boons.</li>\
  \ \n     <li>Details are now available for the Exo-Guardians and Wayfinders capstone\
  \ boons, providing playable statistics for a new race and starship hull.</li> \n\
  \     <li>The instructions for filling out a Chronicle sheet have been updated,\
  \ including when a PC can purchase and sell gear.</li> \n     <li>Rules for applying\
  \ credit have been relaxed slightly when using pregenerated characters in adventures\
  \ that require the use of such characters.</li> \n     <li>Information about the\
  \ Vehicle scenario tag and the Vanity boon descriptor has been added.</li> \n  \
  \   <li>GMs' Chronicle sheet rewards have been clarified.</li> \n     <li>UPBs are\
  \ now purchasable in single units rather than only in lots of 1,000.</li> \n   \
  \  <li>The Tier 2 and Tier 6 Drake starships' shields and armaments have been updated\
  \ to better match the hull's intended function.</li> \n     <li>The list of Regional\
  \ Venture-Coordinators and regions has been updated.</li>\n    </ul> \n    <p>From\
  \ this list, there's a few points I'd like to highlight:</p> \n    <blockquote>\
  \ \n     <p><b>Second Seekers (Jadnura)</b>: Ohhhhhhh a new faction! For those who've\
  \ been interested in seeing how we're going to handle multiple Second Seekers factions,\
  \ then Jadnura is our first example of that. I suspect a lot of the boons are going\
  \ to interest some players out there, especially the ability to replay content and\
  \ earn full credit for it. Similarly, if you like your growing stable of ally boons,\
  \ then this faction is a great opportunity for those of you who want new characters\
  \ to earn even more ally potential.</p> \n     <p><b>New Capstones</b>: Veteran\
  \ Exo-Guardians can bestow a new ship on new Starfinder recruits: the Gorgon. This\
  \ vessel is essentially a murderboat intended to render opposing starships down\
  \ to fine particulate matterâ€”have fun with that. The Wayfinders also reveal their\
  \ associated new race, which shouldn't come as a surprise to players who've been\
  \ playing Starfinder Society since the beginning.</p> \n     <p><b>A More Toothy\
  \ Drake</b>: The Drake base hull has received some further updates. The Tier 2 version\
  \ of the ship has had some weapon upgrades to make it more in line with the type\
  \ of starship role we wanted it to have (at a small cost to its shields). Meanwhile,\
  \ the Tier 6 version of the ship had its erroneous linked missile weapons replaced\
  \ with a potent torpedo launcher.</p> \n     <p><b>Legacy Races Always Available</b>:\
  \ It may not be uplifted bears (don't worry, I'm working on that) but players can\
  \ now enjoy all the <em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em> legacy races as being always\
  \ available. Go forth and populate the universe with dwarves, elves, gnomes and\
  \ all the other legacy races!</p> \n     <p><b>Quality of Life</b>: We've eased\
  \ some of the Additional Resources requirements on new races, allowing players to\
  \ play their new races with handouts provided by scenarios. We've also allowed players\
  \ to apply credit to a character of any level within the level range of a pregenerated\
  \ character scenario, which should ease up some of the credit discussions around\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9tsv?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Special-100-Claim-to-Salvation\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society #1-00: Claim to Salvation</em></a>. There's also been some\
  \ tightening of language around GM Chronicle sheet rewards and how a GM can apply\
  \ character boons during the course of a scenario they run. Finally, you can now\
  \ purchase UPBs in single units rather than in lots of 1,000, which should further\
  \ encourage crafters to build equipment!</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>I'd like\
  \ to give a big shout out to our editors, art and layout folks, and Managing Developer\
  \ Adam Daigle for helping out in getting everything ready for distribution to the\
  \ masses.</p> \n    <p>This update to the <em>Guide</em> should last us until the\
  \ start of our next season, currently slated for June of 2019. Of course, feel free\
  \ to continue posting feedback about the <em>Starfinder Society Guide</em> on the\
  \ Organized Play forums, and we'll do our best to keep compiling all the information\
  \ for future updates.</p> \n    <p><b>Note:</b> The following additions have been\
  \ added to clear up some of the questions we've seen about the new \"always available\"\
  \ status for legacy races in the new update to this guide.</p> \n    <blockquote>\
  \ \n     <h2>Legacy Race Clarification</h2> \n     <p>There have been some questions\
  \ about how players who'd previously unlocked legacy races should handle them now\
  \ that legacy races are always available. The following are official clarifications\
  \ on how players should handle legacy races previously earned in the campaign.</p>\
  \ \n     <ul> \n      <li>Characters who've earned a Legacy Race boon from RSP or\
  \ a special convention boon prior to the publishing of this blog can create or continue\
  \ playing a Legacy Race and increase one ability score that is 14 or lower by 2.\
  \ These characters retain their Personal boon slot but cannot slot in a Personal\
  \ boon that would augment an ability score (such as any of the admittance boons.)</li>\
  \ \n      <li>Characters who've earned a Legacy Race boon via a scenario prior to\
  \ the publishing of this blog can convert the Personal Boon from the \"New Character\"\
  \ option to the \"Existing\" option and earn the +2 in one ability score that is\
  \ 14 or lower. This occupies the Personal boon slot.</li> \n      <li>Characters\
  \ who earn a Legacy Race boon following the publishing of this blog can slot the\
  \ Personal Boon onto their character and select the \"Existing\" option to earn\
  \ the additional ability score boost. This occupies the Personal boon slot.</li>\
  \ \n      <li>For Characters who've applied two legacy race boons to a character\
  \ (one for race access and one for the stat boost) those characters now only gain\
  \ the benefit of the \"Existing\" portion of the race boon. The initial \"New Character\"\
  \ application of the boon is ignored. In no circumstance, can a PC ever earn more\
  \ than one +2 increase to an ability score modifier.</li> \n     </ul> \n    </blockquote>\
  \ \n    <p>So how about making some new characters?</p> \n    <p>Thurston Hillman<br>\
