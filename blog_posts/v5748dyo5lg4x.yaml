  \ Kickstarter included a whole spectrum of awesome rewards, with the higher tier\
  \ incentives becoming increasingly unique. One of the top-level rewards included\
  \ an advance look at <a href=\"https://goblinworks.com/\">Pathfinder Online</a>,\
  \ a tour of the Paizo and Goblinworks offices, a gourmet dinner, and a day of gaming\
  \ with a Pathfinder GM of your choice.</span></p> \n    <p>Two groups of high-level\
  \ backers got that red carpet treatment early in the year, with Erik running marathon\
  \ sessions of his part of the <a href=\"/products/btpy8yqx\">Emerald Spire Superdungeon</a>.\
  \ Our third group just came through a few weeks ago and they were very clear about\
  \ what they wanted to play. They'd been through Carrion Crown, so the natural next\
  \ challenge for them was <a href=\"/threads/rzs2n4kk\">Bastardhall</a>.</p> \n \

  \     <br>Cartography by Rob Lazzaretti\n    </div> \n    <p>So, from 10 AM to 10\
  \ PM, I ran the highly coordinated team of Diana, Brandon, Jami, Heidi, Nicole,\
  \ and Weston through part of my annually expanding terror-themed megadungeon, Bastardhall.\
  \ This particular foray focused on the adventure I ran at Paizocon two years ago\
  \ (adventure four in the ongoing series), The Black Gardens of Bastardhall. </p>\
  \ \n    <p>Rather than recapping the entire session, here are a few highlights and\
  \ pictures from the game.</p> \n    <ul> \n     <li>The greenhouse near the gardens'\
  \ entrance looks vine-choked and sweaty. In this party's case, that meant it was\
  \ nobody's business.</li> \n     <li>Several shrines of the goddess Shelyn watch\
  \ over the gardens, one still attended by a particularly nihilistic huecuva. The\
  \ party tried to cheer up the depressed undead, but ultimately determined unlife\
  \ was a worse punishment than destruction.</li> \n     <li>Hedge mazes can be confusing.\
  \ One way to get through them is to start a massive fire. Of course, it's probably\
  \ best not to start that fire when you're already in the middle of the maze.</li>\
  \ \n     <li><a href=\"/products/btpy8z70\">Pathfinder Cards: Chase Cards 2</a>\
  \ make a handy and pretty intense way to run a burning labyrinth. Give the party\
  \ a set number of turns to escape, then start dealing escalating d6s of fire damage\
  \ per round. Not all will necessarily survive.</li> \n     <li>GM Tip: When someone\
  \ has driven hundreds of miles to spend a day gaming with you, it's poor form to\
  \ permanently kill them in hour three of the game. Instead, bring them back as a\
  \ juju zombie and secretly tell them \"When I give the word, attack the paladin.\"\
  </li> \n     <li>It's handy to have druids and nature sorts on hand. They can tell\
  \ you that hangman trees don't think you're special just because you have fire.\
  \ </li> \n     <li>Somehow, hungry flesh is even worse when it's covered in hay.</li>\
  \ \n     <li>There are a lot of nasty things you can do with mosquitos. After numerous\
  \ swarms and giant specimens, the group was definitely starting to dread every itch\
  \ and buzz. Jamming a few mosquito swarms into a skinstitch scarecrow (<a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8yop\">Bestiary 4</a>) doubles down on the trauma.</li> \n     <li>If\
  \ the runes on any one of a dozen Kellid totems (see <a href=\"/products/btpy8sa5\"\
  >Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Lost Kingdoms</a>) roughly translates in \"mosquito\
  \ god,\" it might be best to leave it alone.</li> \n     <li>Mosquito proboscises\
  \ make fine rapiers, but even better flutes!</li> \n     <li>Players love it when\
  \ you turn to one of them during the climax and say \"That thing we discussed. Now.\"\
  </li> \n    </ul> \n    <center> \n     <table> \n      <tbody>\n       <tr> \n\
