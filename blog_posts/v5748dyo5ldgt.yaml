  \ </div> \n   <p>While every child may curse her mother as a hag from time to time,\
  \ changelings are justified to make such claims. Cursed offshoots of hag liaisons\
  \ in the mortal world who are dropped at the door of mortal adoptive parents, all\
  \ changelings are affected by their heritage in some way. Some rebel against it,\
  \ but many come to terms with it, using the power of their heritage for their own\
  \ purposes or to aid the innocent.</p> \n   <p>It’s not surprising that many changelings\
  \ gravitate toward the witch class since that class’s powers complement both the\
  \ abilities and the theme of the race. In this week’s preview, we will take a look\
  \ at the first race presented in Chapter 3 of the <a href=\"/products/btpy8rv2\"\
  ><i>Advanced Race Guide</i></a> by sharing the archetype presented in the section:\
  \ the Dreamweaver, a witch empowered by dreams and nightmares.</p> \n   <div class=\"\

  \ (Witch)</h2> \n   <p>A changeling dreamweaver draws upon her hag heritage to ply\
  \ the dream realms in order to touch mortal minds and souls, for good or ill. A\
  \ dreamweaver witch has the following class features.</p> \n   <p><b>Class Skills:</b>\
  \ The dreamweaver adds Sense Motive to her list of class skills and removes Healing\
  \ from her list of class skills. Patron: A dreamweaver’s patron is normally portents\
  \ or stars (<a href=\"/products/btpy8k8r\"><i>Ultimate Magic</i></a> 83).</p> \n\
  \   <p><b>Spells:</b> A dreamweaver replaces some of her patron’s spells with the\
  \ following: 2nd—<i>sow thoughts</i> (see below), 4th—<i>dust of twilight</i> (<a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy8fo1\"><i>Advanced Player's Guide</i></a>), 6th—<i>deep slumber</i>,\
  \ 8th—<i>modify memory</i>, 10th—<i>dream</i>, 12th—<i>cloak of dreams</i> (<a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8fo1\"><i>Advanced Player's Guide</i></a>), 14th—<i>ethereal jaunt</i>,\
  \ 16th—<i>moment of prescience</i>, 18th—<i>astral projection</i>.</p> \n   <p><b>Dream\
  \ Spinner (Su):</b> At 2nd level, when a dreamweaver casts a mind-affecting spell\
  \ on a target that is sleeping because of her slumber hex or a spell she cast, she\
  \ adds +1 to the mind-affecting spell’s DC. If the target succeeds at the saving\
  \ throw against the spell, it does not wake up, nor does it have any recollection\
  \ of having resisted a spell. If appropriate, the dreamweaver may incorporate elements\
  \ of a mind-affecting spell (i.e., <i>sow thought, suggestion</i>, and so on) into\
  \ the target’s subconscious so it believes the spell’s effects originated in its\
  \ dreams (the details of how these elements fit into the dream is up to the GM).\
  \ This ability replaces the witch’s hex gained at 2nd level.</p> \n   <p><b>Dream\
  \ Thief (Su):</b> At 6th level, a dreamweaver can alter the sleeping mind of any\
  \ creature that is sleeping because of her slumber hex or a spell she cast. She\
  \ can reshape one of the target’s memories as if using <i>modify memory</i>. Alternatively,\
  \ she may insert herself into the dreaming memories of the target, prompting the\
  \ target’s mind to show her some specific information; the dreamer’s subconscious\
  \ may resist, or try to deceive her with out-of-context memories, similar to the\
  \ way a corpse can resist when questioned with <i>speak with dead</i>. A Will save\
  \ negates either effect (DC equal to that of the witch’s hex). Whether or not the\
  \ save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 1 day.\
  \ This ability replaces the witch’s hex gained at 6th level.</p> \n   <p><b>Dream\
  \ Possession (Su):</b> At 10th level, a dreamweaver can take control of any creature\
  \ that is sleeping because of her slumber hex or a spell she cast. This effect functions\
  \ as <i>magic jar</i>, using the witch’s familiar acting as the soul receptacle.\
  \ A Will save negates either effect (DC equal to that of the witch’s hex). Whether\
  \ or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex again\
  \ for 1 day. This ability replaces the witch’s hex gained at 10th level.</p> \n\
  \   <p><b>Hexes:</b> The following hexes complement the dreamweaver archetype: charm,\
  \ slumber (<a href=\"/products/btpy8fo1\"><i>Advanced Player's Guide</i></a>); beast\
  \ of ill-omen (<a href=\"/products/btpy8k8r\"><i>Ultimate Magic</i></a>).</p> \n\
  \   <p><b>Major Hexes:</b> The following major hexes complement the dreamweaver\
  \ archetype: nightmare, vision (<a href=\"/products/btpy8fo1\"><i>Advanced Player's\
  \ Guide</i></a>).</p> \n   <p><b>Grand Hexes:</b> The following grand hexes complement\
  \ the dreamweaver archetype: eternal slumber (<a href=\"/products/btpy8fo1\"><i>Advanced\
  \ Player's Guide</i></a>); dire prophecy (<a href=\"/products/btpy8k8r\"><i>Ultimate\
  \ Magic</i></a>).</p> \n   <p>Come back next week for another preview of the <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy8rv2\"><i>Advanced Race Guide</i></a>.</p> \n   <p>Stephen\
