  \ border=\"0\" hspace=\"3\" align=\"left\">\n   <p>As the weather turned chilly,\
  \ I went back to Germany to attend the Essen Game Fair, the largest tabletop game\
  \ convention in the world. There, as you may have seen on the Paizo blog, dozens\
  \ of demoers showed off ten different <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7vq5\">Stonehenge</a>\
  \ games. Hundreds of players hopped from table to table trying all the games.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>But none of them got to see what you get to see now. Here I'll describe\
  \ all of the games in the first <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7vq5\">Stonehenge</a>\
  \ expansion, <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7y10\">Nocturne</a>. This expansion provides\
  \ new orange and black pieces for use in six- and seven-player games. And we got\
  \ four more of the greatest board game designers in the world to invent three clever\
  \ new games with a nocturnal theme. (Then I snuck one more in under the cover of\
  \ night. More on that soon.) </p> \n   <div align=\"center\">\n    <img src=\"/image/content/Secondary/PZO2001-sunmoon_500.jpeg\"\

  \ border=\"0\" hspace=\"3\" align=\"left\"> \n   <p><b><i>Sun &amp; Moon</i>, by\
  \ Klaus-Jürgen Wrede:</b> With many apologies to <i>Puerto Rico</i> and <i>Settlers\
  \ of Catan</i>, for my money the single best game of the German revolution is Wrede's\
  \ <i>Carcassonne</i>. So, after it became clear that the Stonehenge main game was\
  \ in good hands, I made a beeline for Klaus-Jürgen. As the most German of the Stonehenge\
  \ designers so far, Klaus-Jürgen turned over the most German of all the Stonehenge\
  \ games so far. </p> \n   <p>Sun &amp; Moon is about cults. Specifically, there\
  \ are two: the Sun Cult and the Moon Cult. Players divide into two cults of one,\
  \ two, or three cultists each. They spend the rest of the game manipulating druids\
  \ to move the pieces of the giant trilithons. (This is the first Stonehenge game\
  \ to start with the trilithons in their component parts.) Your fellow cultists can\
  \ help by marshalling resources, but the opposing cult has a chance to take control\
  \ of those resources before you can get to them. </p> \n   <p>There's some very\
  \ nice game-designer sleight of hand in this game. You think you can see all the\
  \ cards you need in front of the other players, but just before you get to use them,\
  \ somehow it doesn't quite turn out the way you'd planned. I'd expect nothing less\
  \ from a master like Klaus-Jürgen. </p> \n   <div align=\"center\">\n    <img src=\"\

  \ and Serge Laget: </b> In my quest to get every game designer named Bruno to work\
  \ on this line, I asked original Stonehenge designer Bruno Faidutti to introduce\
  \ me to his frequent co-designer Bruno Cathala. Bruno C introduced me to <i>his</i>\
  \ frequent co-designer Serge Laget, and the two of them enthusiastically set to\
  \ work on one of the best-themed games in the line. </p> \n   <p>Bruno and Serge\
  \ suggested that to them, Stonehenge was the perfect star gate, a way for archaeologists\
  \ to unlock the secret of travel through the stars. To open the gate, the rocks\
  \ of Stonehenge must be triggered in a specific order, and the archaeologists must\
  \ puzzle out that order. And so the game becomes a strange and delightful guessing\
  \ game, a la <i>Clue</i>, where everyone has some information but no one has all\
  \ of it. You pick a stone, and the player who knows its location tells you whether\
  \ you've gained any valuable information. When you think you've figured out the\
  \ location of a triggering stone, you can lock in your guess. But if you're wrong,\
  \ other players will leap ahead of you. </p> \n   <p>We spent a lot of time trying\
  \ to figure out whether there was a particular strategy that would always work.\
  \ Everybody had a theory, but no one could consistently win. That pleases me greatly.\
  \ I've never seen a game like this one, and am thrilled it's in Nocturne. </p> \n\

  \ border=\"0\" hspace=\"3\" align=\"left\"> \n   <p><b><i>Stonehenge Hippie Festival</i>,\
  \ by Andrew Looney:</b> If I asked a room full of <a href=\"/store/byCompany/g/greenRoninPublishing/byProductType/nonfiction\"\
  >the top 100 game designers</a> to guess which of them had designed a game called\
  \ \"Stonehenge Hippie Festival,\" 99 of them would say Andy Looney, the permanently\
  \ tie-dyed owner of Looney Labs. The one who wouldn't get it right would be Andy,\
  \ who would be too busy flashing back to Woodstock to realize the question had been\
  \ asked. Hey, we only go to the professionals here. </p> \n   <p>Speaking of professionalism,\
  \ Andy blew me away by having his game designed before I could send him a set of\
  \ pieces. (You can read about that in <a href=\"http://wunderland.com/WhatsOld/2007/WN.02.15.07.html\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Andy's blog</a>.) In the game, you are attending the Stonehenge\
  \ Free Festival, a real-life musicfest series that ran from 1972–1985. You want\
  \ provisions for the festival, and go from booth to booth trying to get them. Actually,\
  \ you can do a lot more than that. You can hang flags off the trilithons. You can\
  \ bogart someone's bottle of water. And you can dance. Oh boy, can you dance. That's\
  \ about all I can say about this game that will make sense until you pick up the\
  \ rules. </p> \n   <p>And hey, how about that fine Howard Lyon piece of art at the\
  \ top of this section? I'm sure I speak for Andy when I say that's a festival we'd\
  \ both want to attend. </p> \n   <p><b><i>Battle of the Beanfield</i>, by Mike Selinker:</b>\
  \ Or maybe I wouldn't want to attend that festival, as the events of this game will\
  \ show. I certainly didn't plan to put another game of mine into the set, but when\
  \ I read Andy's rules, my eyes turned to the history of the Stonehenge Free Festival.\
  \ It ended on June 1, 1985, when jackbooted British cops took truncheons to busfuls\
  \ of hippies in a nearby beanfield. This terrible incident became known as the \"\
  Battle of the Beanfield.\" This was an unjustifiable tragedy, which I looked at\
  \ and immediately said, \"Game.\" </p> \n   <p>So, as a tribute to my boy Andy,\
  \ I designed Stonehenge's first solitaire game, and the only one not to use the\
  \ board. Instead, you use the card box as a \"bus,\" and bars which represent hippies.\
  \ The eight figures represent bobbies looking to crack some hippie skulls. Your\
  \ job as the driver of the bus is to play cards in front of these bobbies, freeing\
  \ the hippies from the cops' clutches and getting them back on the bus. As in solitaire,\
  \ you want to get as close as you can to clearing the board. </p> \n   <p>This game\
  \ might not have been included in Nocturne without Paizo CEO Lisa Stevens, unbidden\
  \ by me, dedicating her nights to playing about 80 games of it, and keeping meticulous\
  \ records of how close she got to a perfect game. Now, Lisa's a busy woman. But\
  \ I figure if she decides to play 80 games of something, we should give you a chance\
  \ to play it as well. So <i>Battle of the Beanfield</i> snuck in as the final game\
  \ of the set. If you lose a few weekends playing it, blame Lisa. </p> \n   <p>Of\
  \ course, the other great advantage of Nocturne is that for your Stonehenge games,\
  \ you now have a bunch more pieces. If you've wanted to bring in more players, now\
  \ you can. Or if you just really like the colors orange and black, now you've got\
  \ orange and black. And, oh yeah, four more fun games, with the promise of lots\
  \ more to come. Have a great night. </p> \n   <p> Mike Selinker <br> <i>Titanic\
