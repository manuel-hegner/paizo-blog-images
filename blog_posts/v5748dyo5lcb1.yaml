  \ seminar/workshop introducing all sorts of things about making terrain for RPGs\
  \ and wargaming. In between various demonstrations of hot wire foam cutting, casting\
  \ bricks in dental plaster, mixing epoxy putty, and using polymer clay, I rattled\
  \ off a bunch of websites with more information and/or product links. Here's a rundown\
  \ on the information and links for sculpting, just in case you missed the seminar.</p>\

  \ as a kid, so you know how it works. It's malleable, and you can shape it however\
  \ you want, but if you want it to keep its shape, you have to fire it in a kiln.\
  \ You probably don't have access to a kiln, so clay isn't a good material for terrain-building—\
  pushing too hard with a mini or a knocked-over book would dent or crush a clay castle\
  \ or statue. Fortunately, two-part epoxy clays like <a href=\"http://www.avesstudio.com/index.php?page=shop.browse&amp;category_id=7&amp;option=com_virtuemart&amp;Itemid=1\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Apoxie Sculpt</a> take care of that problem. Mix the two parts\
  \ and it's soft like clay for about an hour, then becomes as stiff as hard plastic.\
  \ It's available in many colors, and you can paint it if they don't have a color\
  \ to your liking. A tip for using Apoxie Sculpt is to mix it, then let it sit for\
  \ about 15 minutes because it's tacky when first mixed. Work with small amounts\
  \ at a time so you don't mix too much and waste it. Apoxie Sculpt is good for small\
  \ projects, but not really intended for larger items (such as hills), both in terms\
  \ of cost and weight.</p> \n   <p>In the first photo, I've used gray Apoxie Sculpt\
  \ to create a flat area near some Hirst Arts floor tiles, with cut dowels inserted\
  \ to create a wooden barricade (once I paint the dowels with diluted brown paint,\
  \ they'll look like old logs). In the second photo, I used it to smooth out the\
  \ interior screw-threads on some small plumbing pieces I'm using for a steampunk\
  \ gnome city I'm building).</p> \n   <p>If you're looking for a cheaper alternative\
  \ to Apoxie Sculpt, you can buy a package of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/s/qid=1308015200/ref=a9_sc_1?ie=UTF8&amp;search-alias=aps&amp;field-keywords=mighty%20putty\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Mighty Putty</a> online, at hardware stores, department stores\
  \ (usually in the home improvement section) and other locations for about $10; it's\
  \ grainier, and smells like sulfur, but has similar uses, and once it's painted\
  \ you can't smell the sulfur anymore.</p> \n   <p><b>Epoxy Putty</b></p> \n   <p>Anyone\
  \ who's worked with miniatures is probably familiar with kneadadite epoxy putty,\
  \ commonly known as \"greenstuff.\" It's packaged as a strip or tube of yellow and\
  \ blue; when mixed it's green, and remains pliable for 1–2 hours. Greenstuff is\
  \ good for fine details (like creating a glyph on a stone), and remains slightly\
  \ flexible even after it hardens, but it gets expensive if you use it for large-scale\
  \ pieces, and its flexibility is a drawback if you're creating something that has\
  \ to support weight (such as an arched bridge). You can buy kneadatite from <a href=\"\
  /store/gameAids/tools/theArmyPainter/v5748btpy8d3a\">the Paizo store</a>, hobby\
  \ shops, or other online retailers such as <a href=\"http://www.thewarstore.com/product18832.html\"\

  \ the advantages of clay but don't want to mix stuff or a time limit on it remaining\
  \ pliable, polymer clays such as <a href=\"http://www.sculpey.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\
  >Sculpey</a> are workable like clay, but harden when baked in a conventional oven\
  \ (I hear you can harden it by dipping it in boiling water, though you'd probably\
  \ want to put the piece in a sieve so you can easily dip and retrieve it). Sculpey\
  \ is available in many colors, including several stonelike clays. You can purchase\
  \ it from art stores, hobby stores, and department stores. If you have silicone\
  \ molds (see <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lcad\">Beginning Terrain-Making Blog,\
  \ Part 2: Using Silicone Molds </a>), you can press Sculpey into the mold, carefully\
  \ bend the mold to pop out the soft \"casting\" of the brick, bend and twist the\
  \ Sculpey into a different shape, then bake the clay until it's hard (I used this\
  \ technique with a floor tile mold to create a corridor with floors that rose and\
  \ fell in waves).</p> \n   <p>Sean K Reynolds <br>Designer</p> \n  </blockquote>\
