  \   <h1 itemprop=\"headline\">Pathfinder Battles Preview: A \"Huge\" Announcement</h1>\
  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Friday, April 19, 2013</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"\
  > \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">This week we interrupt our usual schedule\
  \ of previews for the upcoming <a href=\"/products/btpy8xg6\">Skull &amp; Shackles</a>\
  \ set of <a href=\"/store/byCompany/w/wizKids/byProductType/pathfinderMiniatures\"\
  >Pathfinder Battles</a> prepainted fantasy miniatures to bring you an update on\
  \ exciting Pathfinder Battles developments related to other product releases.</span></p>\
  \ \n    <p>Ever since our second set, <a href=\"/products/btpy8rqs\">Rise of the\
  \ Runelords</a>, we've been working with WizKids to find a better solution for releasing\
  \ Huge miniatures into the Pathfinder Battles line. Releasing figures this large\
  \ as part of a normal set previously involved two different kinds of booster boxes,\
  \ which was confusing to both customers and retailers. We knew we needed a better\
  \ solution.</p> \n    <p>Today we're announcing a release that we believe is a step\
  \ toward a better solution for Huges in the form of a new Encounter Pack entitled\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy8yj4\">White Dragon Evolution</a>. This new non-random\
  \ boxed set is scheduled for a summer release, and will include THREE original white\
  \ dragon sculpts!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130419-MediumFront.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130419-MediumFront_180.jpeg\" border=\"\

  \ src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130419-MediumBack_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Up first we have the Medium White Dragon, perfect\
  \ for a low-level end boss or mid-level minion. Based on art created for the <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy8tj5\">Pathfinder Bestiary Box</a> by Paizo favorite (and\
  \ <a href=\"/paizocon\">PaizoCon 2013</a> Special Guest) Ben Wootten! This Medium\
  \ White Dragon may seem small compared to his larger brothers in the White Dragon\
  \ Evolution set, but I assure you he's so awesome it'll freeze your blood.</p> \n\
  \    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130419-LargeFront.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130419-LargeFront_180.jpeg\" border=\"\

  \ src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130419-LargeBack_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Here we have the next step in a dragon's life cycle,\
  \ the Large White Dragon! This all-new sculpt is also based on a Ben Wootten illustration,\
  \ and it really pushes the upper end of the Large scale, giving you more mini for\
  \ your money.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130419-HugeFront.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130419-HugeFront_180.jpeg\" border=\"\

  \ src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130419-HugeBack_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>This friendly fellow was originally sculpted for inclusion\
  \ in the Rise of the Runelords set, and is based on Wayne Reynolds's cover illustration\
  \ for <a href=\"/products/btpy815p\">Pathfinder Adventure Path #5: Sins of the Saviors</a>.\
  \ We're thrilled to finally bring this Huge figure to you, and I can't wait to see\
  \ what you think when you have it in hand. I think it's one of the best sculpts\
  \ we've done to date.</p> \n    <p>More \"Evolution\" Encounter Packs will be announced\
  \ in the next few months, showing additional creatures at multiple sizes. We also\
  \ plan to release additional Huge figures in the Encounter Pack boxed set format\
  \ based around themes rather than a single creature presented three different ways.\
  \ Stay tuned to this space for more news as it develops.</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130419-GoblinCommando_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Several weeks ago I mentioned that we forgot\
  \ to photograph two figures from June's <a href=\"/products/btpy8ww8\">We Be Goblins!</a>\
  \ Builder Series set. Well, the production samples for this set arrived at the Paizo\
  \ offices this week, so they're finally ready for their big debut. This guy above,\
  \ the Goblin Commando on Goblin Dog, is ready to tear into your campaign (and into\
  \ your player characters).</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130419-GoblinDog.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130419-GoblinDog_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>And last we have the lowly Goblin Dog,\
  \ a verminous pet kept by goblins in lieu of actual dogs, whom goblins hate with\
  \ unparalleled passion. Both of these figures are at the common rarity.</p> \n \
  \   <p>And that's it for this week! Join us here next week as we once again set\
  \ sail into the dangerous waters of the <a href=\"/products/btpy8xg6\">Skull &amp;\
  \ Shackles</a> set!</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p> \n   </div>\
