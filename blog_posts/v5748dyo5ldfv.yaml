  \ Season 1, the Pathfinder Society Organized Play campaign has featured a number\
  \ of multipart scenarios—mini campaign arcs designed to tell longer and more complex\
  \ stories than a single 4-hour gaming session can provide. Whether in the form of\
  \ four-part series like The Devil We Know, Echoes of the Everwar, and the Tier 12\
  \ retirement arc The Eyes of the Ten; a three-part arc like this season’s The Quest\
  \ for Perfection and last season’s The Heresy of Man and Shades of Ice; or a two-part\
  \ story such as The City of Strangers, Shadow’s Last Stand, and Before the Dawn,\
  \ the level of continuity between segments and the arcs’ overall scopes have varied\
  \ quite a bit in the last three years.</p> \n   <p>One of my goals as developer\
  \ of the Pathfinder Society Scenarios line is to make multipart scenarios feel more\
  \ cohesive and to provide players with a sense of accomplishment for completing\
  \ these long format series. But finding the right balance of telling compelling,\
  \ immersive stories and meeting the needs of the organized play campaign’s unique\
  \ design parameters hasn’t come easy. And we’re still trying out new things.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Earlier this year, we released the Wonders in the Weave series, a Tier\
  \ 5–9 two-part arc introducing characters to the <i>Hao Jin Tapestry</i>, the private\
  \ demiplane the Society won as part of the Ruby Phoenix Tournament at the season’\
  s halfway point. In this series, we tried something new with the mutliparters: we\
  \ provided a boon at the end of the first installment, <a href=\"/products/btpy8ow2\"\
  ><i>The Dog Pharaoh’s Tomb</i></a> that grants no inherent bonuses. But having this\
  \ boon on the Chronicle sheet immediately preceding the second chapter in the series,\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy8ow4\"><i>Snakes in the Fold</i></a> allowed characters\
  \ to earn a second boon that is only awarded for those PCs playing the story in\
  \ order and without interruption between.</p> \n   <p>That method worked okay, but\
  \ we still felt there was room for improvement. So with the release of last month’\
  s Tier 7–11 scenario, <a href=\"/products/btpy8qq0\"><i>Pathfinder Society Scenario\
  \ #3–20: The Rats of Round Mountain, Part I: The Sundered Path</i></a>, we had a\
  \ chance to try a different tack with multipart boons. We were further motivated\
  \ to push the envelope by the specific circumstances of this mini-arc’s plot: the\
  \ PCs travel to the center of a hollow mountain in Part I, and then venture into\
  \ a ratfolk stronghold within the mountain in Part II. It didn’t make sense for\
  \ PCs to make a long trek, then magically be outside the mountain and even back\
  \ on the Material Plane doing other adventures, partaking in a Day Job, or even\
  \ buying equipment, then suddenly be back in the middle of the mountain at the start\
  \ of the next adventure. If it were so easy to get back and forth from the mountain’\
  s center to Absalom, why did they need to journey there on foot in Part I?</p> \n\
  \   <p>The solution we came up with is this: at the end of The Sundered Path, PCs\
  \ are given a choice to remain there, forgoing the ability to purchase equipment\
  \ or spellcasting services, make Day Job checks, or participate in other scenarios,\
  \ or to hand-wave their characters’ continuity but sacrifice their ability to get\
  \ a larger boon as a reward for playing the two scenarios back-to-back. Since PCs\
  \ inside Round Mountain who choose the former are assumed to have been there continually\
  \ before the start of Part II, <a href=\"/products/btpy8qq2\"><i>Pagoda of the Rat</i></a>,\
  \ they won’t receive a faction handout for the scenario, and only need to complete\
  \ a faction mission if they want to; players doing both scenarios continuously will\
  \ automatically receive full prestige for the second part of the series. What the\
  \ other benefits of sticking it out are, I’m going to keep under my hat, but I think\
  \ folks will be pleased with the rewards.</p> \n   <p>Be sure to participate in\
  \ the discussion of this topic below, or on our <a href=\"/paizo/messageboards/paizoPublishing/pathfinder/pathfinderSociety/general\"\
  >Pathfinder Society messageboards</a>, and let us know what you think of this experiment.</p>\
