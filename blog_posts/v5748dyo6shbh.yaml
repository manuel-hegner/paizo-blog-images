  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Players who read though\
  \ <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq023gd?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Legends\"\
  ><em>Lost Omens Legends</em></a> might find that they want to learn more about just\
  \ what kind of deals Baba Yaga can offer them or the cool alchemy techniques that\
  \ Artokus Kirran saves for only his most important students. GMs who read through\
  \ the book might see that Queen Abrogail Thrune has contracts that can offer great\
  \ power (with an obviously high price) or that Runelord Sorshen can teach a new,\
  \ enchanting spell. These cool new options are easy enough to hand out, but we want\
  \ tables to do more than just snag a new feat or magic item. We want you to meet\
  \ these legends in the flesh! At least, as best as one can with a roleplaying game.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>To help out with that, I’ve put together a brief little encounter\
  \ in Qahir Palace, home of Satrap Xerbystes II, his wife Shahiyan Deena al-Parishat,\
  \ and his vizier Hebizid Vraj. The palace is located in Katheer, capital of Qadira.\
  \ For this encounter, the PCs have earned the right to visit with Satrap Xerbystes.\
  \ Perhaps the PCs are here for a diplomatic endeavor to win the satrap’s favor.\
  \ Maybe the vizier called them to the palace to task them with an important mission.\
  \ It could also be that the PCs won Deena’s attention after a notable horse race.\
  \ Whatever the case, the PCs are now in the royal palace and, of course, things\
  \ are about to go wrong.</p> \n     <p>The encounter below is for 9th-level Pathfinder\
  \ characters. First, let’s take a look at the map. The map is of a large Qadiran\
  \ palace that has lots of room for intrigue, stealth, and of course, combat. Feel\
  \ free to use this map as you like in your own game, sprinkling in encounters, traps,\
  \ and more as you see fit. Today’s encounter takes place in the throne room, but\
  \ could totally spill out into the rest of the palace!</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  \ Palace</h3> \n     <p>This luxurious palace serves as the home for Xerbystes II.\
  \ The palace itself is relatively small compared to others throughout the Padishah\
  \ Empire of Kelesh, but remains impressive nonetheless. The palace is lit with bright\
  \ light throughout the day and the guards that patrol the palace use personal torches\
  \ after dark. The palace ceilings rise to a height of 20 feet on the first floor\
  \ and are only 10 feet high on other floors.</p> \n     <ol> \n      <li><b>Palace\
  \ Stairs</b>: These fine, marble stairs lead up to the palace.</li> \n      <li><b>Bazaar</b>:\
  \ Shahiyan Deena al-Parishat allocates this space for local merchants to sell their\
  \ wares. She specifically selects merchants with unique or high-quality items in\
  \ an attempt to showcase Qadiran crafting skill.</li> \n      <li><b>Entryway</b>:\
  \ This grand domed arch serves as the palace entrance. The pair of guards posted\
  \ here make sure to only allow expected guests inside and also keep an eye on the\
  \ bazaar.</li> \n      <li><b>Barracks</b>: The palace guards sleep here between\
  \ shifts.</li> \n      <li><b>Stable</b>: Deena keeps a number of her prized mounts\
  \ here as this stable offers better defenses than the stable on the palace grounds.\
  \ The staircase leads down to the armory landing (room 23).</li> \n      <li><b>Meeting\
  \ Chambers</b>: Xerbystes and Hebizid use this chamber for meetings with diplomats\
  \ and other guests. </li> \n      <li><b>Courtyard</b>: This open-air garden offers\
  \ a break from the cramped quarters of the palace.</li> \n      <li><b>War Room</b>:\
  \ Xerbystes uses the table’s illusion magic to discuss battle strategy with his\
  \ advisors.</li> \n      <li><b>. Storage</b>: Palace staff keep food and other\
  \ supplies here. The staircase descends down to the additional storage (room 26)\
  \ and the rest of the basement.</li> \n      <li><b>Throne Room</b>: Xerbystes holds\
  \ court in this large chamber. A secret door on the back wall allows Xerbystes to\
  \ slip away to other floors in times of danger. Spotting the door requires a successful\
  \ DC 25 Perception check, though a specialized mechanism prevents immediate use\
  \ for the door. Xyrbestes, Deena, and Hebizid all know the required method of using\
  \ the door and can do open it with a single Interact action. Anyone else will need\
  \ to succeed at three total DC 30 Thievery checks to Disable the Device that locks\
  \ the door. The secret passage leads up to the secret chamber connecting the royal\
  \ bedroom (room 19) and the basement tunnel (room 29).</li> \n      <li><b>Servant’\
  s Quarters</b>: This are the resting quarters for the palace staff.</li> \n    \
  \  <li><b>Kitchen</b>: The palace staff are available at all hours to make a meal\
  \ here.</li> \n      <li><b>Dining Hall</b>: Xerbystes holds regular dinners here\
  \ for guests. The palace staff use the smaller tables as serving tables during meals.</li>\
  \ \n      <li><b>Bathing Room</b>: This is Deena’s personal bath.</li> \n      <li><b>Shahiyan’\
  s Chambers</b>: This are Deena’s personal quarters.</li> \n      <li><b>Office</b>:\
  \ Deena uses this office when writing letters and other messages.</li> \n      <li><b>Vizier’\
  s Chambers</b>: Hebizid stays in these chambers and uses the connected office for\
  \ his work. </li> \n      <li><b>Vizier’s Office</b>: Hebizid uses this office for\
  \ his work. </li> \n      <li><b>Royal Bedroom</b>: This are Xerbystes’s personal\
  \ quarters. A secret door connects to hidden chamber. Locating and using the door\
  \ uses the same rules as the secret door in the throne room. </li> \n      <li><b>Lounge</b>:\
  \ Xerbystes relaxes here during evenings, usually with Deena or Hebizid as a companion.</li>\
  \ \n      <li><b>Bathing Room</b>: This is Xerbystes’s personal bath.</li> \n  \
  \    <li><b>Stairwell</b>: This staircase leads down to the main hallway between\
  \ the servant quarts and the kitchen, allowing the staff quick access when tending\
  \ to royal needs.</li> \n      <li><b>Armory Landing</b>: This small landing contains\
  \ a staircase that connects to the stable (room 5) upstairs.</li> \n      <li><b>Armor</b>:\
  \ The palace guards keep their equipment and extra gear in this room.</li> \n  \
  \    <li><b>Guard Lounge</b>: The palace guards relax here when off-duty or taking\
  \ breaks. Extra beds are kept here to support additional guards during important\
  \ events.</li> \n      <li><b>Additional Storage</b>: The rest of the palace storage\
  \ is here and connects with the storage upstairs (room 9).</li> \n      <li><b>Library</b>:\
  \ Xerbystes keeps notable reading material and important documents such as financial\
  \ records here.</li> \n      <li><b>Royal Treasury</b>: This room holds the palace’\
  s treasure. A guard stands at the entryway at all times of the day.</li> \n    \
  \  <li><b>Basement Tunnel</b>: This secret tunnel connects to the other secret chambers\
  \ on the above floors. Locating and using the doors that connect to this tunnel\
  \ uses the same rules as the secret door in the throne room.</li> \n     </ol> \n\

  \ royalty. Upon being ushered into the palace, you make your way into the grand\
  \ throne room.”</p>\n     </blockquote> \n     <p>A local pro-slavery group, the\
  \ Burning Sands, has grown upset at Deena’s continued abolitionist stance and have\
  \ decided to put an end to the abolitionist decrees coming from the palace. The\
  \ group recently learned of the PC’s visit to the palace and recognized that it\
  \ would serve as a perfect distraction for their attack on the palace so they can\
  \ put an end to Xerbystes and Deena.</p> \n     <p><b>Creatures</b>: The members\
  \ of the Burning Sands are disguised as staff and roaming the throne room. A servant\
  \ notices one of the assassins drawing their blade. Her scream alerts the room and\
  \ Xerbystes (or the appropriate person) immediately slips into the secret chamber\
  \ behind the throne room, escaping to safety. It’s up to the PCs to fend off the\
  \ assassins! 1d4+1 rounds after the combat begins, a squad of palace guards join\
  \ in to assist the PCs. </p> \n     <h4>Burning Sands Assassins (4) — Creature 8</h4>\

  \ they earn the satrap’s thanks. In addition to a hefty gold reward of 900 gp, Xerbystes\
  \ offers the PCs a particularly unique gift. His palace spellcasters have developed\
  \ a method that can infuse an animal companion with elemental power, converting\
  \ the animal companion into a genie-touched companion. He is willing to have his\
  \ spellcasters use this technique on the PC’s companions or grant them one of these\
  \ companions as a gift.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/072320_Deena.jpg\"\
