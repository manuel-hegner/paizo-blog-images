  articleBody\"> <span itemprop=\"description\"><p>This year marks my 30th Gen Con.\
  \ As I sit back and think about my years going to the granddaddy of all gaming conventions,\
  \ I am awed by the many big moments that I got to experience while attending the\
  \ show, first as a fan and later as part of the adventure game publishing industry.</p></span>\
  \ \n    <p>When I was a kid, there was a series of books for young readers, <i>We\
  \ Were There</i>, with titles such as <i>We Were There at the Battle of Gettysburg</i>\
  \ and <i>We Were There at the Battle of the Bulge</i>. Each book covered an important\
  \ moment in world history from a child's point of view; you read a fun story but\
  \ also learned a bit of history in the process. I ate these books up when I was\
  \ in grade school. As I think across the 30 Gen Cons I have attended, I think about\
  \ some of the important pieces of adventure game history that I have had the privilege\
  \ of experiencing firsthand at Gen Con. <i>I was there</i>!</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  \ \n    <p>At my first Gen Con in 1984, TSR brought in the all-star cast of artists\
  \ they had working full time on D&amp;D: Clyde Caldwell, Jeff Easley, Larry Elmore,\
  \ and Keith Parkinson. Each took turns doing sketches of people's characters for\
  \ $10 a sketch—a bargain even then—and answering questions. These four artists created\
  \ the visuals for Dragonlance, the Forgotten Realms, and other settings, essentially\
  \ defining the look of D&amp;D for the future, and earning them places among the\
  \ most famous artists in adventure gaming history. Not only did I get to meet them,\
  \ but Clyde Caldwell drew a sketch of my character, Erwyle, that hangs on my office\
  \ wall today.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/LisaBlog-01.jpg\"\

  \ \n    <h2>I was there for the release of the AD&amp;D Battlesystem</h2> \n   \
  \ <p>In 1985, the year Gen Con moved to Milwaukee, I was walking through the new\
  \ convention center when my friend Rich and I were asked to play in one of the first\
  \ public games of the new AD&amp;D Battlesystem. As neophytes at Gen Con, we jumped\
  \ at the chance to experience this important AD&amp;D product first hand. But that\
  \ wasn't what made this experience awesome: our two opponents in the battle were\
  \ none other than Ed Greenwood (of Forgotten Realms fame) and Mike Nystul (of <i>Nystul's\
  \ Magic Aura</i> fame). Where else but Gen Con could two young Minnesota gamers\
  \ cross paths with two icons of D&amp;D, and be the first to play a major new AD&amp;D\
  \ release?</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/Battlesystem_1st_500.jpeg\"\

  \    </div> \n    <h2>I was there for the launch of <i>Dungeon</i> Magazine</h2>\
  \ \n    <p>One of the most seminal Gen Con moments in my mind is the launch of <i>Dungeon</i>\
  \ in 1986. As a fan of D&amp;D and TSR, I began every Gen Con by running to the\
  \ TSR booth and buying whatever cool new D&amp;D product was being launched at the\
  \ show. In 1986, that product was <i>Dungeon</i> Magazine. I ran to the booth and\
  \ eagerly filled out my subscription form and gave it to Kim Mohan. He informed\
  \ me that I was the very first subscriber and handed me my copy of the first issue.\
  \ I couldn't believe it, so I had him autograph it and inscribe \"Congrats on being\
  \ the first subscriber\" on the title page. To think, twenty-one years later, my\
  \ own company would release the <i>last</i> print issue of <i>Dungeon</i> at Gen\
  \ Con 2007. </p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/product/magazine_issue/dungeon/1/cover_500.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <h2>I was there for the launch of Magic: The Gathering</h2>\
  \ \n    <p>Probably one of the biggest events in the history of gaming happened\
  \ at Gen Con 1993, and it was one that I had a big hand in. The introduction of\
  \ Magic: The Gathering to the teeming crowds of gamers was a big part of my master\
  \ plan for launching Magic into the marketplace. We didn't have much money at Wizards\
  \ of the Coast. We didn't have many employees—and we couldn't afford to actually\
  \ pay the few we did have. But Gen Con had the world's most dedicated gamers coming\
  \ together for four days in Milwaukee, and I figured that if we couldn't convince\
  \ <i>them</i> to play Magic, then the game probably didn't have a chance. I put\
  \ my tiny marketing budget into making the biggest splash we could manage at Gen\
  \ Con. We packed up every employee and volunteer we could find and headed from Seattle\
  \ to Milwaukee. We were ready for the world to see our baby… but our baby almost\
  \ didn't show up! Shenanigans in US Customs threatened to cause our shipment from\
  \ our card printer in Belgium to miss the convention! Only after many phone calls\
  \ and an overnight plane flight for our Magic boxes were we able to unleash Magic\
  \ on the world as I had hoped. And boy, did my plan work! We sold decks and boosters\
  \ and displays of Magic as fast as people could hand over their money. By the end\
  \ of the show, we were out of cards, Magic was a phenomenon, and Wizards of the\
  \ Coast had arrived! </p> \n    <h2>I was there for the announcement of D&amp;D\
  \ Third Edition </h2> \n    <p>Gen Con 1999 was a big one for us at Wizards. We\
  \ had purchased TSR less than two years prior. And now we were going to announce\
  \ that we were working on a new edition of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, and there was\
  \ no better venue than at the \"Best Four Days in Gaming!\" We knew there would\
  \ be a lot of consternation over the announcement, and if we didn't do it well,\
  \ we would garner a lot of ill will. So we decided to make the announcement to a\
  \ thousand hardcore gamers in the form of a talk show. The D&amp;D team spent weeks\
  \ plotting and planning, lining up special guests including Gary Gygax and Dave\
  \ Arneson, and getting the design team geared up with such speakers as Monte Cook,\
  \ Jonathan Tweet, Bill Slavicsek, and others. The announcement went off without\
  \ a hitch, and there were even several standing ovations. At the end of the event,\
  \ we handed out T-shirts listing various things about Third Edition that we thought\
  \ would tantalize the crowd:</p> \n    <ul> \n     <li>Half-orc barbarian sorcerer\
  \ = Yes</li> \n     <li>Demihuman level limits = No</li> \n     <li>Monks &amp;\
  \ Assassins = Yes</li> \n     <li>Universal Skill System = Yes</li> \n     <li>Evil\
  \ gnoll rangers = Yes</li> \n     <li>THAC0 = No</li> \n     <li>Rules you never\
  \ used anyway = No</li> \n     <li>Demons &amp; Devils = Yes</li> \n     <li>Critical\
  \ Hits = Yes</li> \n     <li>9th-level clerical spells = Yes</li> \n     <li>Ability\
  \ score improvements = Yes</li> \n     <li>Strength 48 = Yes<p></p></li> \n    </ul>\
  \ \n    <h2>I was there for the launch of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game</h2> \n\
  \    <p>As Gen Con 2009 approached, there was a lot of trepidation in my heart.\
  \ Paizo would be launching the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, and the reception would\
  \ either save the company or doom it. I could see no other outcome. Wizards had\
  \ launched 4th Edition at the previous Gen Con, and we had decided to forge our\
  \ own path. The pile of Core Rulebooks sitting on the floor of our booth was our\
  \ wager in this game; we'd put everything we had into making them. We were \"all\
  \ in.\" As the doors to the exhibit hall opened, we amazed by the waves of gamers\
  \ that poured into our booth to buy the Core Rulebook. The crowd quickly overwhelmed\
  \ our modest booth, and we had to route the line through the art show! That Gen\
  \ Con launch fueled the growth of both Paizo and Pathfinder.</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>And that's just the tip of the iceberg!\
  \ Every Gen Con, history is made somewhere. Events happen that will be fodder for\
  \ stories for years to come. \"The Best Four Days in Gaming\" are the crucible where\
  \ our hobby is forged and reforged, and when you go, you too will be able to say\
  \ <i>you were there</i>! I look forward to seeing you all at Gen Con in just a few\
  \ short weeks!</p> \n    <p>Lisa Stevens<br> <i>CEO</i></p> \n   </div> \n  </blockquote>\
