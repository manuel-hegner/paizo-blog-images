  \    <p itemprop=\"description\">This week's Worldscape Workbook covers how I decided\
  \ what magic items and adventuring gear to give Red Sonja for her official Pathfinder\
  \ game statistics, but before I delve into the nitty gritty, I've got two announcements\
  \ about personal appearances I'll be making to support <a href=\"/products/btpy9oco\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Worldscape #1</em></a>, which hits newsstands on Wednesday, October\
  \ 19th.</p> \n    <p>Later this week I'll be signing pre-Worldscape Pathfinder comics\
  \ I've written at the Dynamite booth at New York Comic Con! I'll be appearing from\
  \ 4:00-5:00 on Friday and Saturday, and I'll even have some Pathfinder Goblin Mini-Mates\
  \ on hand for dedicated Paizo blog-watchers.</p> \n    <p>At NYCC, I'll also be\
  \ on Dynamite's \"Dynamite Entertainment: Our Explosive New Comics of 2017... And\
  \ Beyond!\" panel on Thursday night at 7:30 PM at area 1A02 in the Javitt's Center.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>On Wednesday, October 19th, to celebrate the official launch day of <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy9oco\"><em>Pathfinder Worldscape #1</em></a>, I'll be appearing\
  \ at the world-famous Meltdown Comics in Los Angeles to sign copies of the new book\
  \ and chat with Pathfinder fans! The signing starts at 7:00 PM. I'm super excited\
  \ to visit the store again and to be a part of an official event there! <a href=\"\

  \ target=\"_blank\">Please join me!</a></p> \n    <p>Ok! With that out of the way,\
  \ let's get down to Red Sonja!</p> \n    <p>In previous weeks, I've discussed the\
  \ game design challenges presented by Red Sonja's \"chainmail bikini,\" but of course\
  \ the She-Devil with a Sword has more equipment than just her armor.</p> \n    <p>A\
  \ few assumptions up front.</p> \n    <p>When determining Red Sonja's level, I wanted\
  \ to leave enough room at the \"top end\" to allow for \"future\" Red Sonja stories\
  \ like Dynamite's \"Vulture's Circle\" or \"The Black Tower,\" and I didn't want\
  \ Red Sonja to be so super-heroic that she was a novelty high-level-only NPC.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>We assume the Pathfinder iconic heroes are about 5th or 6th level at\
  \ the beginning of <a href=\"/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics/worldscape\"\
  >Pathfinder Worldscape</a>. I wanted the versions of famous heroes they encountered\
  \ in the Worldscape to be more capable than them (naturally), but still plausible\
  \ adventuring companions under the Pathfinder rules, meaning they'd be similarly\
  \ challenged by the same foes. So if the iconics were 5th or 6th, that meant I'd\
  \ put folks like Red Sonja and John Carter closer to 7th. High enough to get the\
  \ extra attack at 6th level, certainly.</p> \n    <p>To tell the truth, I had a\
  \ lot of inertia to make Red Sonja 7th level. This has to do with the Pathfinder\
  \ Society's rules for pre-generated characters, which come in a few specific levels,\
  \ of which 7th is one. Let's just say I had reason to think it would be interesting\
  \ to end up with stats that worked as a basis for a PFS pregen for Red Sonja and\
  \ leave it at that. Nothing to announce, folks, I assure you. Nothing to see here.\
  \ Move along.</p> \n    <p>Anyway, I ended up going with 8th level so Sonja would\
  \ qualify for a class feature of her archetype that kicks in then, about which we'll\
  \ talk in a near-future column. I'll reverse engineer her stat block to 7th later\
  \ if I need to for whatever reason. For now I decided to go with the more interesting\
  \ character build.</p> \n    <p>So, at 8th level, by the Pathfinder rules as a player\
  \ character (because, come on, I'm not statting these guys up as anything less),\
  \ Red Sonja should have 33,000 gp worth of gear.</p> \n    <p>That seemed like a\
  \ lot, so I immediately started looking into the possibilities. First, I turned\
  \ to my notes of all the gear I'd seen Red Sonja use over the first 18 issues of\
  \ Dynamite's revamped series under the guidance of writer Gail Simone. Barring various\
  \ different costumes or armor worn by Sonja over these issues, that list reads as\
  \ follows:</p> \n    <ul>\n     <li>Sword</li> \n     <li>Throwing dagger</li> \n\
  \     <li>Leather gloves</li> \n     <li>Left armband</li> \n     <li>Right armband</li>\
  \ \n     <li>Leather boots</li> \n     <li>Hooded cloak</li> \n     <li>Shortbow</li>\
  \ \n     <li>Waterskin</li>\n    </ul> \n    <p>As you'll recall from <a href=\"\
  /paizo/blog/tags/pathfinderWorldscape\">previous installments of this column</a>,\
  \ I had originally planned to design Red Sonja's chainmail bikini as a suit of \"\
  decorative armor\" that offered a +0 armor bonus, but didn't count as wearing armor\
  \ for certain class features. That meant that Sonja couldn't wear <i>bracers of\
  \ armor</i>, which meant I needed a solution to cheat to get her improvements to\
  \ her AC that would allow her to go toe-to-toe with other martial characters of\
  \ her level, who generally would be wearing a lot more armor than she does.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderComics/20161005-ArmBands.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderComics/20161005-ArmBands_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>I zeroed in pretty quickly on Red Sonja's armbands. Although\
  \ each artist draws Sonja their own way, during the Gail Simone arcs, she had a\
  \ pretty consistent look drawn by artist Walter Giovanni, who gave each of the two\
  \ armbands a distinct appearance. Sonja's right armband was a solid ring of gold,\
  \ while the one she wears on her left arm looks more like a coiled snake. Two different\
  \ armbands, I thought, two different opportunities for some cool unique magic items\
  \ to get around her armor problem.</p> \n    <p>I also had another problem I wanted\
  \ to solve, and this one came from actual play. Over the summer, in particular at\
  \ PaizoCon and PaizoCon UK, I ran special games based on the Pathfinder Worldscape\
  \ ideas I was working on in comic scripts at the time. I kludged together a storyline\
  \ similar to Valeros's manifestation in the Worldscape in <a href=\"/products/btpy9oco\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Worldscape #1</em></a>, complete with anachronistic enemies and\
  \ the untimely arrival of a Barsoomian White Ape, and set it upon some of Paizo's\
  \ biggest fans. At the end of these sessions, I set Red Sonja herself against the\
  \ party—or at least a seriously \"rough draft\" version of the character cribbed\
  \ from a kit-bashed stat block from the <a href=\"/products/btpy8v3a\"><em>NPC Codex</em></a>.\
  \ And every time, she blew a Will save and the encounter ended prematurely.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>So I wanted those two different armbands to do two different things.\
  \ One, which I originally called an \"armlet of natural armor\" that enhanced your\
  \ natural armor bonus and one called a \"coiled armlet\" that allowed you to reroll\
  \ a blown save. The <i>armlet of natural armor</i> was a boring utilitarian item,\
  \ essentially a slotless <i>amulet of natural armor</i> at twice the price. I didn't\
  \ really think anyone needed to pay a professional game designer for such a simple\
  \ idea, but oh well. She needed the bonus to her AC, sexy or not. The <i>coiled\
  \ armband</i> was a little more interesting, but given that it involved creating\
  \ a gp value for rerolling a failed save, I didn't quite know how to determine a\
  \ price for it.</p> \n    <p>In this, as in so many things, I turned to Jason Bulmahn,\
  \ and in the process of laying out an arcane way of doing it that I have already\
  \ forgotten (but will try to get him to recount for a future blog), he reminded\
  \ me that the feat Improved Iron Will would give Red Sonja that rerolled saving\
  \ throw on the type of save for which she needed it most.</p> \n    <p>This was\
  \ the same conversation that convinced me, ultimately, that Red Sonja's armor didn't\
  \ need to be some rules-breaking contrivance, but that <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lj46\"\
  >it could simply not be armor at all</a>. Once the armor wasn't armor at all, that\
  \ opened things back up for good old <i>bracers of armor</i>. I decided to give\
  \ Sonja Improved Iron Will, which removed my other idea for a new, unique armlet.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>At the same time, Dynamite supplied me with the illustration that would\
  \ accompany Red Sonja's stat block in <a href=\"/products/btpy9oco\"><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Worldscape #1</em></a>. Much to my surprise, it did not feature two different\
  \ armbands at all. Instead, this image of Sonja (by occasional Pathfinder Comics\
  \ cover artist Carlos Gomez) has two solid gold armbands instead of two different\
  \ ones.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderComics/20161005-RedSonja.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderComics/20161005-RedSonja_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>At this point I decided to listen to fate, and I simply\
  \ made Red Sonja's armbands <i>bracers of armor +4</i> and called it a day. Sometimes\
  \ the simplest solution really is the best one.</p> \n    <p>Speaking of calling\
  \ it a day, I've rambled on quite a lot! We'll pick up this gear discussion next\
  \ week, when I shift the focus to Red Sonja's weapons!</p> \n    <p>Until then,\
  \ please do me a huge favor and consider setting up a <a href=\"/products/btpy8tvw\"\
  >Pathfinder Comics Ongoing Subscription</a>. Doing so will ensure that you receive\
  \ every issue of <a href=\"/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics/worldscape\"\
  >Pathfinder Worldscape</a> delivered straight to your door. People are always asking\
  \ what they can do to support the comic, and my answer is this: If you have a local\
  \ comic store, ask them to add <a href=\"/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics/worldscape\"\
  >Pathfinder Worldscape</a> to your pull list. If you don't have a local comic shop,\
  \ please <a href=\"/products/btpy8tvw\">set up that subscription</a> now!</p> \n\
  \    <p>I'll see some of you (I hope!) later this week at New York Comic Con and\
  \ some more of you on the 19th at Meltdown Comics in Los Angeles!</p> \n    <p>Thanks\
