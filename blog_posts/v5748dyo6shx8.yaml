  \ there! It's Dana Ebert (she/her), and I'm so excited to be back so soon! In <em>Monsters\
  \ of Myth</em>, I took on Desert's Howl, which first appeared in <em>Mythical Monsters\
  \ Revisited</em> almost ten years ago. This version expands on Jalari's story, while\
  \ reimagining Desert's Howl as a unique monster with brand new lore and abilities\
  \ for Second Edition.</p> \n      <p>I honestly adore the final stat block for Desert's\
  \ Howl. I conceptualized its abilities with the intent of using mechanics to convey\
  \ the feeling of being hunted and toyed with, and this version is simply vicious\
  \ at denying the player characters rest and recovery in between encounters with\
  \ the creature. With the release of this book, I hope that there'll be a few more\
  \ Desert's Howl fans in the future!</p> \n      <p>As always, thank you so much\
  \ for reading and making this community such a wonderful place! If you use Desert's\
  \ Howl or any of its lore in your campaign (I'm very fond of Jalari's treasure coins,\
  \ myself), I would love to hear about it on Twitter (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/MistressDanaRPG\"\
  >https://twitter.com/MistressDanaRPG</a>). And if you ever want to know more about\
  \ what I'm currently working on, you can find that information on my Linktree (<a\

  \ \n      <br> \n      <h3>Sen.H.H.S</h3> \n      <p>Hello, readers and greetings\
  \ from Sen.H.H.S., your freelancer who lives across the Pacific Ocean from North\
  \ America. You may have seen me around in projects such as Bestiary 3, Ruby Phoenix's\
  \ Goka Gazetteer, <em>Secret of Magic</em>, and many other publications. For <em>Monsters\
  \ of Myth</em>, I wrote the kaijus. When this assignment first came down, I was\
  \ internally screaming because my gods, the pressure to deliver! Just how am I going\
  \ to do these gigantic walking natural or supernatural disasters justice? After\
  \ copious amounts of kaiju wikia consumption and kaiju movie clips (Pacific Rim\
  \ is the best movie ever!) I hope the end result is as awe-inspiring (or horror-inspiring)\
  \ as intended. If you’re interested in knowing what I'm up to recently in the TTRPG\
  \ sphere, follow me on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SenHHS\">@SenHHS</a>\
  \ where I bemoan how my current reading list of forensic textbooks is raising eyebrows.\
  \ </p> \n      <br> \n      <h3>Aaron Lascano</h3> \n      <p>Hello! I’m Aaron,\
  \ and I wrote and designed rules for two sections in <em>Monsters of Myth</em>:\
  \ Kuworsys and Somnalu. I had an absolute blast working on both of them, as I did\
  \ a bit of research and reading of epic myth to prepare (a quick recommendation:\
  \ <em>The Epic of Gilgamesh</em> is a genuinely incredible read). I’m fascinated\
  \ by how myths are remembered, and how interpretations and treatments of myth change\
  \ over time. I hope my sections even encourage players to do a bit of that themselves.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>With Kuworsys, I had the opportunity to craft a new story around a\
  \ pre-existing location, and with Somnalu, I got to contribute to the story of a\
  \ legendary figure from Pathfinder’s past. I’m very excited for players to explore\
  \ the ever-shifting ruins of Kuworsys’s labyrinth and to descend into the depths\
  \ to confront slithering Somnalu.</p> \n      <p>If you’re interested, you can find\
  \ me on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/devlascano\">@devlascano</a>. I\
  \ make narrative-focused TTRPGs on Itch and I do freelance work on games whenever\
  \ an opportunity arises. Cheers! </p> \n      <br> \n      <h3>Andrew Mullen</h3>\
  \ \n      <p>Howdy! I’m Andrew Mullen, writer of xulgaths and quite a few other\
  \ monsters at this point. For this project, I worked alongside Josh Kim and Liane\
  \ Merciel. Josh wrote Kothogaz’s lore, and turning that into rules was an exciting\
  \ challenge. I wanted a big, campaign-ending abomination to have more ‘breadth’\
  \ in the story than just the confrontation where you hope to kill it. For the Melfesh\
  \ Monster, I just got to read through Liane’s fantastic work and pluck out tidbits\
  \ to turn into monster abilities—she gave me a ton to work with!</p> \n      <p>Beyond\
  \ my co-authors, I want to give a special thanks to my cousin Sameer Gupta. He’\
  s a talented musician who focuses on American jazz and Indian classical music. Given\
  \ Kothogaz’s ties to Vudra, it was important that I do right by any real-world Indian\
  \ cultural aspects I used for inspiration. Without Sameer, the Craft Disharmonic\
  \ Instrument and Raga of Remembrance sections wouldn’t be nearly as flavorful, interesting,\
  \ or accurate. You can check him out <a href=\"https://sameergupta.com/press-quotes-artist-bio/\"\
  >on his website</a>, and across social media as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tablajazz\"\
  >@tablajazz</a>. I also highly recommend his album “A Circle Has No Beginning”—\
  it’s gotten me through a lot of late night deadline pushes!</p> \n      <br> \n\
  \      <h3>Shay Snow</h3> \n      <p>Hi, I'm Shay Snow (they/them), I'm an editor\
  \ at Paizo, and I wrote up the Kallas Devil and partnered with the extremely talented\
  \ Liane Merciel to stat up Ulgrem-Axaan! I hope my skipping rhyme and lovely letters\
  \ bring you lots of shivers, and I hope you enjoy all of the neat things that both\
  \ the Kallas Devil and Ulgrem-Axaan can do for your games! You may have seen me\
  \ in <em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Grand Bazaar</em> and <em>Secrets of Magic</em>,\
  \ and I have a few things coming out in <em>Galactic Magic</em>. Additionally, you\
  \ can find my name on a few Coyote &amp; Crow projects!</p> \n      <p>When not\
  \ writing, I’m usually discussing Native issues and rights over on my Twitter <a\
  \ href=\"https://twitter.com/spellsinsugar\">@SpellsInSugar</a>, where you can also\
  \ sometimes catch me talking about video games and horror media. You can keep up\
  \ with my work, or even contact me for hire, through my website <a href=\"https://shayjay.carrd.co/\"\
  >https://shayjay.carrd.co/</a>!</p> \n      <br> \n      <h3>Soup</h3> \n      <p>\"\
  Heya, I’m Soup! I’m a nonbinary Korean-American freelance writer/game designer/podcaster/streamer.\
  \ I love nothing more than cool new angles on classic fantasy tropes. I’m really\
  \ excited for this book because I got to draw from Korean mythology and tradition\
  \ to bring you the Taljjae, a creature inspired by the real-life mask dancing of\
  \ Korea, and hopefully a cool addition to your games. You can find me streaming\
  \ video games here (<a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/literalsoup\">https://www.twitch.tv/literalsoup</a>),\
  \ my work here (<a href=\"https://literalsoup.com/\">https://literalsoup.com/</a>),\

  \   <br> \n      <h3>Jake Tondro</h3> \n      <p>From a tall tower of ivory Tondro\
  \ arose,<br> Where tales of Tolkien and Arthur he’d told.<br> But he exited, hexed,\
  \ a man in exile,<br> To get a gamer’s refuge working for golems.<br> Then in plague,\
  \ a plentiful pestilence,<br> Luis and Eleanor, developers at large,<br> Boldly\
  \ offered a boon to the bairn.<br> “Fafnheir,” they said first, “of linnorms the\
  \ father<br> “And Grogrisant, greedy for imperial guts<br> “Belong in this book,\
  \ do not betray us!”<br> This task Tondro gladly took up<br> And laboring long in\
  \ darkness and light<br> He sang the six-eyed lion’s song<br> And wove a wyrm from\
  \ stubborn words.</p> \n     </blockquote> \n    </div> <!-- tags: Paizo, Community,\
