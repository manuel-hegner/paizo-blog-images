  \  <p itemprop=\"description\">Spring has arrived, and that means that the Organized\
  \ Play team is in full gear preparing for convention season. Tonya talked about\
  \ some of the exciting offerings we have coming up next month at PaizoCon in <a\
  \ href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkq1?Organized-Play-at-PaizoCon-2018\">last week's\
  \ blog</a>, so if you haven't seen that yet, I recommend checking it out. I've attended\
  \ PaizoCon for the past six years, and I've always had a wonderful time. Sometimes\
  \ I play pretty much the whole time, sometimes I GM more, and other times I keep\
  \ my schedule light so I can focus on meeting new people and reconnecting with old\
  \ friends, but I've always found it well worth the trip.</p> \n    <p>But what do\
  \ we have to offer for you this month? We have two more adventures to introduce,\
  \ both of which send the PCs to nations that we have never before visited in Organized\
  \ Play. The first, <a href=\"/products/btpy9zk2?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-9-18-Scourge-of-the-Farheavens\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #9-18: Scourge of the Farheavens</em></a>, takes\
  \ place just off the northeastern edge of the Inner Sea map, in the plague-blighted\
  \ land of Iobaria. I'll turn it over to Michael Sayre, who took the lead on this\
  \ project, to tell you more.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><em>Scourge of the\
  \ Farheavens</em> takes place primarily in Iobaria, which was an exciting proposition\
  \ simply for how little time the Pathfinder Society has spent in that area. Getting\
  \ the opportunity to explore this relatively under-supported area of Golarion and\
  \ learn more about the people who live there was an exciting proposition, particularly\
  \ given that this scenario will give the PCs a peek at the god-caller traditions\
  \ of a Sarkorian clan. Jason Owen Black did an amazing job of breathing life into\
  \ the decimated remnants of the Farheavens clan and the harsh living conditions\
  \ of the Iobarian wilderness, while Sebastian Rodriguez's illustration of Dolok\
  \ Darkfur conveys exactly the right mix of ferocity and loneliness. As much as I\
  \ love the rich depth of the characters and environment in this scenario, I would\
  \ be remiss if I failed to mention that this scenario features some harrowing encounters\
  \ that convey the true dangers of the Iobarian forests in appropriately deadly fashion.</p>\
  \ \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Our second scenario this month, <a href=\"/products/btpy9zk3?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-9-19-Clash-in-Kaimuko-Wood\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #9-19: Clash in Kaimuko Wood</em></a>, sends the\
  \ PCs into the aasimar nation of Tianjing. The country's military is ill-prepared\
  \ for the ancient threat that lurks in Kaimuko Wood, and evil forces plot to take\
  \ advantage of their weakened defenses. Thanks to the Pathfinder Society's successful\
  \ efforts in <a href=\"/products/btpy9y4g?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-912-Shrine-of-the-Sacred-Tempest\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #9-12: Shrine of the Sacred Tempest</em></a>, a\
  \ highly trained group of tengu mercenaries has agreed to lend their swords to the\
  \ PCs' cause. With the tengus at their command, the PCs journey to a troubled fort\
  \ and finally brave a part of the forest so tainted by abyssal corruption that it\
  \ burns with unholy flame. Author Jerall Toi brings rich and compelling NPCs to\
  \ meetâ€”take a look at the masked leader of the tengu band, Tai Dan, brilliantly\
  \ illustrated by Hannah Boving. But this scenario certainly isn't all about roleplay,\
  \ as Kaimuko Wood is crawling with creatures that are eager to make sure the PCs\
  \ and their allies never escape the forest.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
