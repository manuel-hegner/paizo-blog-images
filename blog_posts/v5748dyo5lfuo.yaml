  >At the warning cry, Aberny looked back and noticed the crude frame of branches\
  \ that propped a large rock pile above the tunnel they'd emerged from. Even as he\
  \ did, a scrabble of talons alerted him just before the beast burst upward, jaws\
  \ snapping every which way. It clamped onto the ledge with one claw and swept the\
  \ other out.</span></p> \n     <p>Ralynn jumped away, but the claw tore out the\
  \ supporting branches instead, dropping the pile in a dust-raising crash and sealing\
  \ off any escape. The chimera fell back to the floor, crunching Tali's bone sculpture\
  \ beneath its feet as she scrambled for cover.</p> \n     <p>Ralynn leapt to the\
  \ ground after it, whipping out a second sword. He kicked a skull at the chimera\
  \ and ran in after, blades leading the way.</p> \n     <p>Aberny hurried to see\
  \ if he could dislodge the rock fall and give them a chance to flee. He threw aside\
  \ several smaller rocks, but realized the boulders would require massive effort\
  \ to budge.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb360\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500_Tali_500.jpeg\"\

  > </a>\n      <br>Tali's view of the hunt is nothing if not unique.\n     </div>\
  \ \n     <p>The chimera bounded all about the cavern, with plenty of room to maneuver\
  \ despite its bulk. It flapped up to the far wall, clung there for a moment as its\
  \ claws dug in, and then dropped to crush the fighter. Ralynn somersaulted aside,\
  \ and the chimera landed with a boom that shook the whole place.</p> \n     <p>Aberny\
  \ grabbed up a larger rock and lugged it to the edge. He took aim, and then flung\
  \ it down at the chimera. He howled and raised a triumphant fist as the rock smashed\
  \ into one of the beast's wings, preventing another leap-and-crush attempt.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Ralynn darted in, using the distraction to gouge the creature's flanks.\
  \ Aberny went for another rock, as yowls rose from below. Right as he reached the\
  \ edge a second time, the chimera lunged up, abandoning Ralynn to attack him instead.\
  \ He threw the rock, but the dragon's head snapped it out of midair. At least now\
  \ it couldn't spew acid in his face.</p> \n     <p>The other two heads drove forward.\
  \ He fell back, grabbing for his weapons as fangs and horns strained inches from\
  \ his feet. Then the chimera bellowed and fell back. Aberny leaned over to see what\
  \ had happened.</p> \n     <p>Ralynn had hacked off a hind paw, and the chimera\
  \ now hobbled after him while trailing a ragged, gore-soaked stump. The fighter\
  \ grinned and flicked blood from his blades. </p> \n     <p>The chimera stumbled\
  \ forward and Ralynn thrust for the kill. However, the dragon head rose and spewed\
  \ a wide stream of acid. As Ralynn twisted desperately to dodge this, the chimera\
  \ threw itself forward. A claw snagged Ralynn's leg and pinned him to the ground.\
  \ The chimera leaned in, all mouths gaping.</p> \n     <p>Tali's voice rang out.\
  \ \"Ralynn, shut your eyes!\"</p> \n     <p>The half-elf squeezed his eyes closed\
  \ right before a flash of dazzling lights burst before the chimera's faces. It reared\
  \ and staggered on its remaining hind paw.</p> \n     <p>Freed, Ralynn rolled up\
  \ and raised both swords as the chimera dropped back in front of him. He brought\
  \ the blades down on the neck of the nearest head—the goat. The head gave a gargling\
  \ bleat as it was hacked off to splatter at Ralynn's feet. </p> \n     <p>A frenzied\
  \ wing beat knocked the fighter back, while the lion and dragon roared and screeched\
  \ in pain. The chimera hunched and launched itself toward one of the wider cracks\
  \ in the cavern walls.</p> \n     <p>The crack must've been formed in soft earth,\
  \ for it burst wide under the chimera's impact, raining roots and rock all about.\
  \ The creature shoved most of the way out. Its hind leg gave a last kick to free\
  \ itself, and then only its fading cries could be heard as it fled. </p> \n    \
  \ <p>Tali emerged from her hiding spot behind an oversized ribcage, while Ralynn\
  \ caught his breath and Aberny made his way to the chamber floor. By the time he\
  \ got there, the half-elf and gnome were inspecting the paw and goat head. </p>\
  \ \n     <p>Ralynn probed the head with the tip of a blade. \"Poor trophy. Might\
  \ as well have killed an oversized goat.\"</p> \n     <p>Aberny eyed the hole in\
  \ the cavern wall. \"Even if it survives that wound, I doubt it'll return to let\
  \ you claim the rest.\" </p> \n     <p>\"Just in case,\" Tali said, \"maybe we should\
  \ get out of here?\"</p> \n     <p>The three climbed back to the ledge and began\
  \ the arduous job of clearing the path out. Before they left, Aberny made sure to\
  \ retrieve his sword, feeling an odd desire to never travel without one close at\
  \ hand again. Ralynn grabbed up the paw and head, while Tali chose a few blood-speckled\
  \ rib fragments.</p> \n     <p>Once they emerged into sunlight and fresh air, Aberny\
  \ leaned on his staff, suddenly more weary than he'd ever been. \"I've a proposition.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>The two looked to him.</p> \n     <p>\"Since our contract was hastily\
  \ made and without the clearest of wits, what say we mutually dissolve it and let\
  \ survival be its own reward? We can tell whatever version of what happened here\
  \ that we wish.\"</p> \n     <p>Ralynn lifted the chimera parts. \"So long as I\
  \ keep these.\" He caught Aberny's eye. \"I'm not as stuck on our original deal.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>Tali glanced between the two, curious, but shrugged when neither\
  \ was forthcoming. \"Good enough for me.\"</p> \n     <p>Aberny smiled, pulled out\
  \ the battered parchment, and tossed it back down to languish with the bones.</p>\
  \ \n     <p align=\"center\">∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n     <p>Aberny entered the art gallery,\
  \ double-checking the card delivered the previous day to make sure he had the right\
  \ time and place.</p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p><i>Master Aberny,</i></p> \n\
  \      <p><i>It would be the greatest honor if you would attend the opening exhibit\
  \ of \"Horrors of the Hunt,\" under the patronage of the Gilvreau Gallery. We feature\
  \ the finest paintings and sculptures ever to grace our town, being a testament\
  \ to Whistledown's continued contributions to the pinnacle of society that is artistic\
  \ inspiration and craft.</i></p> \n      <p><i>Sincerely,</i><br> <i>Steward Feles,\
  \ on behalf of the Gilvreau Gallery</i></p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>He scanned\
  \ the main room. Humans, gnomes, elves, and others crowded the hall, where at least\
  \ a dozen paintings hung alongside another dozen sculptures and carvings. Some of\
  \ the pieces even combined sculpture and painting, with molded bronze, steel, and\
  \ silver interwoven with canvas to give the work a surprising depth and substance.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>In one painting, a shadowy beast loomed over a trio of figures, framed\
  \ against a background of vivid firelight. There, fighters engaged a chimera on\
  \ the edges of a rocky pool. And there, random bones had been wired together to\
  \ create a miniature model of a chimera skeleton, wings spread, looking ready to\
  \ leap on viewers.</p> \n     <p>Never had Aberny seen such raw depictions of dread\
  \ and violence. Not only had the artist captured the chimera's bestial qualities,\
  \ but also the underlying terror and imminence of death it evoked. Many of the scenes\
  \ even gave the impression of the hunters being the prey.</p> \n     <p>After perusing\
  \ the selection for a while, he found Tali chatting in a ring of admirers. A month\
  \ had passed since the ill-fated hunt, and her attire had taken a turn for the fashionable.\
  \ Adorned with a gem-studded tiara, she wore a dress of blue and crimson. When she\
  \ spotted him, she excused herself and rushed over to grasp his hand.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>\"Master Aberny! So glad you could make it.\"</p> \n     <p>He smiled and\
  \ they exchanged pleasantries, such as her rise in society and how his sword-fighting\
  \ lessons progressed. When they found a corner beyond the press of the crowd, he\
  \ cleared his throat.</p> \n     <p>\"I've been thinking a bit since we last saw\
  \ one another. Reflecting on a few oddities of our time in the grasslands.\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>One of her emerald eyebrows twitched. \"Such as?\"</p> \n     <p>\"\
  Such as how the chimera tracked our scent so quickly. Why it took off with you when\
  \ it had the upper hand with Ralynn. And how you knew enough of its nature—even\
  \ its language—to appeal to its bestial vanity.\"</p> \n     <p>Her lips tweaked\
  \ at the corners. \"Quite strange.\"</p> \n     <p>\"As I recall, a large portion\
  \ of our first dinner went... well, not missing, but perhaps unaccounted for would\
  \ be the better description. Now, I'm not one to doubt a voracious appetite, but\
  \ for a gnome, such a repast would've likely split his or her stomach wide—if it\
  \ was actually devoured at all. And then there was a particular item that would've\
  \ drawn the creature's ear from a goodly distance.\"</p> \n     <p>He drew out the\
  \ Whistledown charm she'd dropped when the chimera had taken her beside the pool.\
  \ \"A memento of our little hunt and congratulations for your success.\"</p> \n\
  \     <p>Tali licked her lips as she squirreled the charm away. Then she glanced\
  \ about, no doubt looking for a particular half-elf.</p> \n     <p>\"Are you going\
  \ to tell him?\" she asked.</p> \n     <p>He chuckled darkly, suspicions confirmed.\
  \ \"I haven't decided. He's not in town at the moment, either way. While the head\
  \ and paw weren't exactly the trophies Ralynn wished, they worked well enough to\
  \ boost his reputation—especially after an alchemist confirmed the chimera blood.\
  \ He left two weeks ago with a band of treasure hunters.\" </p> \n     <p>Then he\
  \ shed all mirth. \"But I want to know how you managed to come to an agreement with\
  \ the chimera.\"</p> \n     <p>Her nose crinkled. \"Agreement?\"</p> \n     <p>\"\
  How did you get the creature to act as a model for your art? An offer of safety\
  \ in exchange for leading it to us?\"</p> \n     <p>Her eyes widened. \"No! I might've\
  \ aggravated the situation a bit, but we had no dealings. It wouldn't have been\
  \ real, if so. I had to live it. The struggle had to be authentic, or else it wouldn't\
  \ mean anything.\"</p> \n     <p>\"You understood it. Spoke with it.\"</p> \n  \
  \   <p>\"Languages are art, like I said. Each one I can converse in adds to my palette\
  \ of comprehension.\"</p> \n     <p>\"But why? What possessed you to tempt our deaths\
  \ that way?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Oh! This, of course.\" She wobbled her head, indicating\
  \ the gallery. \"My art can now be infused with unparalleled passion and perspective.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"You got my men killed.\"</p> \n     <p>\"We all accepted a certain\
  \ amount of risk, didn't we? I faced the same dangers as everyone else.\"</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"You could've told us. We could've set an ambush from the start.\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"That would've been just as bad as if I'd collaborated with the beast.\
  \ It would've undermined the reality I needed to experience.\"</p> \n     <p>He\
  \ sighed, trying and failing to summon fury at the deception. Sadly, he understood\
  \ all too well the lengths one might go to for personal advancement. Should he reveal\
  \ the deal he'd struck with Ralynn? Or perhaps scrawl another debt in his ledgers?</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Aberny rubbed his chin, as if pondering the virtues of the piece they\
  \ stood before. \"Perhaps Ralynn will never find out, so long as certain steps are\
  \ taken. A favor paid, say, to avoid dark rumors besmirching the reputation of a\
  \ promising young artist.\"</p> \n     <p>Tali squared up with him, thin arms crossed.\
  \ \"So! What's the bargain, then?\"</p> \n     <p>He waved at the surrounding artwork.\
  \ \"Your work should be admired by lovers of art far and wide. I would... politely...\
  \ request an exclusive contract as distributor and representative of your craft\
  \ beyond Whistledown. Sole purveyor, receiving a significant percentage of every\
  \ sale for my efforts.\"</p> \n     <p>Tali grinned. \"Ah! I'll have to talk to\
  \ the gallery owners, but I'll be as persuasive as possible for an old friend.\"\
  \ She stuck out a hand. As his engulfed hers for a brief squeeze, she held it a\
  \ moment longer. \"Good fortune, Master Aberny. Of course, I say that hoping you'll\
  \ funnel some of that my way in the end.\"</p> \n     <p>His laugh drew a few askance\
  \ looks. \"Be careful what you hope for, dearest Tali. In the end, fortune makes\
  \ fools of us all.\"</p> \n     <p align=\"center\"><b>Coming Next Week</b>: Viking-style\
