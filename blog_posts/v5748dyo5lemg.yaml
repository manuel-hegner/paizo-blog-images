  \ source material to different mediums can be really difficult. Each form of entertainment\
  \ has its own strengths and weaknesses. Movies aren't books, games aren't prose,\
  \ and comics aren't video games. When you move between mediums, you need to understand\
  \ what the essence of the source material is and do all you can to keep that core\
  \ intact while adjusting the rest around it.</span></p> \n    <p>When Erik Mona\
  \ invited me to pitch Paizo a plan for the Pathfinder comic series I was thrilled\
  \ and intimidated at the same time. The Pathfinder setting is robust and detailed,\
  \ filled to the brim with incredible story potential. Thousands of gaming groups\
  \ have taken the world of Golarion and made it their own, populating it with characters\
  \ and events from the sourcebooks while using it as a canvas for their own creativity.\
  \ How could I filter all that great material down into a cohesive and engaging comic\
  \ that would work for longtime fans but also be new-reader friendly?</p> \n    <p>I\
  \ banged it around in my brain for a while and honestly thought I'd bitten off more\
  \ than I could chew, until I realized the essence of what makes Pathfinder, and\
  \ tabletop gaming as a whole, so great.</p> \n    <p>It's the <i>characters</i>.\
  \ It's <i>always</i> been the characters.</p> \n    <p>We play these wonderful games\
  \ because we want to connect with characters and with each other. The characters\
  \ we make, PCs or NPCs, are storytelling avatars that empower us and entertain us.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>If I could create a cast of characters that felt genuine and had the\
  \ kind of playful interaction I enjoy so much around the gaming table, then it could\
  \ work. Of course, all the details and rules would find their way into the comic\
  \ too, but they'd be there reinforcing that core of character interaction.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Using the beautiful visual designs established for the iconics by Wayne\
  \ Reynolds, I started to brainstorm who they were: their goals, mannerisms and idiosyncrasies.\
  \ Once I figured that out I felt confident I could create a comic that <i>felt</i>\
  \ like gaming with friends, regardless of where the actual story went.</p> \n  \
  \  <p>When I get a chance to meet readers of the Pathfinder comic at conventions\
  \ and they tell me they enjoy it because it reads like a great gaming session, I\
  \ know we've done our job well. The essence is intact even though it's been adapted\
  \ to a new medium. I'm proud of the series and excited about our second story arc\
  \ arriving in 2013. If you haven't had a chance to check out the Pathfinder comic,\
  \ I encourage you to browse the free samples posted here online (<a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5leiy\"\

  \ \n    <p>I hope you enjoy reading the Pathfinder comic as much as I'm enjoying\
  \ writing it. Getting the chance to flesh out the Pathfinder iconics has been a\
  \ real honor. I can't wait to level them up for many more adventures to come.</p>\
