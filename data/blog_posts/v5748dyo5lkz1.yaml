  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">One of the trickiest parts\
  \ of the rules is multiclassing. At its heart, multiclassing allows you to build\
  \ almost any character you can envision, taking parts from multiple classes to build\
  \ the perfect version of your character. Making these rules play well with the rest\
  \ of the game, unfortunately, has always been a challenge. Concepts that really\
  \ should work together just fell flat, leaving you with a character who could not\
  \ perform at its level and keep pace with single class characters. This was especially\
  \ the case for certain classes, like most spellcasters, that had a central class\
  \ feature or features that you would fall sharply behind in if you weren't constantly\
  \ progressing in that class.</p> \n     <p>Suffice to say, when it came time to\
  \ redesign the system for the Pathfinder Playtest, we knew that multiclassing needed\
  \ work.</p> \n     <p>Then came the <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkvj?Archetypes-for-All\"\
  >rules for archetypes</a>. The new design for this emblematic part of the game allows\
  \ archetypes to be taken by any class, so you can decide exactly how much you want\
  \ to invest into an alternative path for your character. The more we worked on that\
  \ system, the more it began to sound like it shared almost exactly the same goals\
  \ as multiclassing. Our thought was, shouldn't they just be the same system?</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Multiclass archetypes are one of the more experimental parts of the\
  \ Pathfinder Playtest. So much so that there are only four of them in the book,\
  \ one for cleric, one for fighter, one for rogue, and one for wizard. Just like\
  \ ordinary archetypes, you must take a special dedication feat to gain access to\
  \ the archetype, but you cannot be of the same class as the archetype (so you can't\
  \ take the rogue dedication feat if you are already a rogue). Let's take a look\
  \ at one of these feats.</p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-title\"\
  >Wizard Dedication <span class=\"stat-block-cr\">Feat 2</span></p> \n      <p class=\"\
  stat-block-1\">Archetype, Dedication, Multiclass</p> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-1\"\
  ><b>Prerequisites</b> Intelligence 16, trained in Arcana</p> \n      <hr style=\"\
  margin: 0.5rem 0;\"> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-1\">You cast spells like a wizard\
  \ and gain a spellbook containing four arcane cantrips of your choice. You gain\
  \ access to the Cast a Spell activity and the Material Casting, Somatic Casting,\
  \ and Verbal Casting actions. You can prepare two cantrips each day from those found\
  \ in your spellbook. You're trained in spell rolls and spell DCs for casting arcane\
  \ spells and in attacks you make with arcane spells. Your key spellcasting ability\
  \ for these spells is Intelligence. You can use wands, scrolls, and staves, but\
  \ only for spells of a spell level you can cast. Arcana is a signature skill for\
  \ you.</p> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Special</b> You cannot select another\
  \ dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the wizard archetype.</p>\
  \ \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>Right away, this lets you cast a few simple cantrips;\
  \ allows you to use wands, scrolls, and staves; and makes Arcana a signature skill\
  \ for you (meaning you can advance your proficiency in the skill to master and legendary).\
  \ Like other dedication feats, once you've taken Wizard Dedication, you gain access\
  \ to other wizard archetype feats, each of which makes you a more powerful master\
  \ of the arcane arts. Take a look.</p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-title\"\
  >Basic Wizard Spellcasting <span class=\"stat-block-cr\">Feat 4</span></p> \n  \
  \    <p class=\"stat-block-1\">Archetype</p> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Prerequisites</b>\
  \ Wizard Dedication</p> \n      <hr style=\"margin: 0.5rem 0;\"> \n      <p class=\"\
  stat-block-1\">Add two level 1 spells to your spellbook. You gain a single level1\
  \ spell slot that you can use to prepare a level 1 spell from your spellbook. At\
  \ 6th level, add two level 2 spells to your spellbook, and you gain a level 2 spell\
  \ slot that you can use to prepare a level 2 spell from your spellbook. At 8th level,\
  \ add two level 3 spells to your spellbook, and you gain a level 3 spell slot that\
  \ you can use to prepare a level 3 spell from your spellbook.</p> \n      <p class=\"\
  stat-block-1\">Even though you can cast spells, the spell level of your cantrips\
  \ and arcane powers is half your level rounded up.</p> \n     </blockquote> \n \
  \    <p>This feat pays dividends all the way up through 8th level, giving you more\
  \ spells you can cast, and if you take it later on in your career, you get all of\
  \ that spellcasting all at once. Better still, there are additional feats you can\
  \ take to gain spells of up to 8th level! But let's say you want to be even more\
  \ of a wizard—you want to get some of the other class features that make wizards\
  \ fun to play. Take a look at these feats.</p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p class=\"\
  stat-block-title\">Arcane School <span class=\"stat-block-cr\">Feat 4</span></p>\
  \ \n      <p class=\"stat-block-1\">Archetype</p> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-1\"\
  ><b>Prerequisite</b> Wizard Dedication</p> \n      <hr style=\"margin: 0.5rem 0;\"\
  > \n      <p class=\"stat-block-1\">Select one school of magic from those found\
  \ in the wizard class. You gain the level 1 school power tied to your school and\
  \ a pool of Spell Points equal to your Intelligence modifier that you can use to\
  \ cast that power.</p> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-1\">If you already have a pool\
  \ of Spell Points, use the higher ability score to determine the pool, as normal,\
  \ and your Spell Point pool increases by 1.</p> \n      <p></p> \n      <p class=\"\
  stat-block-title\">Basic Arcana <span class=\"stat-block-cr\">Feat 4</span></p>\
  \ \n      <p class=\"stat-block-1\">Archetype</p> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-1\"\
  ><b>Prerequisites</b> Wizard Dedication</p> \n      <hr style=\"margin: 0.5rem 0;\"\
  > \n      <p class=\"stat-block-1\">Gain a level 1 or level 2 wizard feat of your\
  \ choice.</p> \n      <p></p> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-title\">Advanced Arcana\
  \ <span class=\"stat-block-cr\">Feat 6</span></p> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-1\"\
  >Archetype</p> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Prerequisites</b> Basic Arcana</p>\
  \ \n      <hr style=\"margin: 0.5rem 0;\"> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-1\">Gain\
  \ one wizard feat. For the purposes of meeting its prerequisites, your wizard level\
  \ is equal to half your level.</p> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Special</b>\
  \ You can select this feat more than once. Each time you select it, you gain a new\
  \ wizard feat.</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>There's even a feat that gives\
  \ you additional spell slots of every level except for your two highest, giving\
  \ you more versatility in your spellcasting. It's important to note that these powers\
  \ come at the cost of some of the flexibility of your primary class, but not at\
  \ the cost of core features. A cleric who multiclasses into fighter will keep all\
  \ of her spellcasting abilities, but she will have to trade out some of the feats\
  \ that allow her to be better at casting <i>heal</i> or at using domain powers in\
  \ exchange for increased proficiency in weapons and armor, added hit points, and\
  \ the ability to make attacks of opportunity. You might even choose to multiclass\
  \ into several classes. You could play a cleric who, in addition to all her cleric\
  \ spells, also has up to 8th-level druid spells and 8th-level wizard spells, though\
  \ such a three-tradition spellcaster would have few cleric feats to speak of!</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Well, that about covers the rules for multiclassing in the Pathfinder\
  \ Playtest. If these archetypes work, you can expect to see one for each class in\
  \ the final version of the game, giving you the flexibility to build characters\
  \ that draw on more than one class to make their concept click. We hope you'll give\
  \ these a try during the playtest and let us know what you think!</p> \n     <p>Jason\
