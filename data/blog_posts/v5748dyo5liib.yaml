  \ \n    <p class=\"date\">Friday, February 12, 2016</p> \n    <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"\
  > \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">It's Friday, and I've got some delightful news\
  \ to share with you! I'm pleased to report that last week, WizKids sent Paizo the\
  \ first batch of digital sculpts for our next, as-yet-unannounced <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\"\
  >Pathfinder Battles</a> set, and they are PHENOMENAL. A few of our editors looked\
  \ over my shoulder as I flipped through them the first time, and one even suggested\
  \ that this may turn out to be the best <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder\
  \ Battles</a> set yet. I certainly agree that, at the very least, it's in the same\
  \ league as some of our very best sets!</p> \n     <p>And just wait until you see\
  \ the case incentive(s)! You guys are going to FREAK!</p> \n     <p>Of course, the\
  \ set has not yet been announced (that happens VERY soon), and the sculpts are still\
  \ in approvals, so I can't quite show them off just yet.</p> \n     <p>But don't\
  \ despair! I do have some delightful images to show off of actual figure photos\
  \ of miniatures from <a href=\"/products/btpy9fyt\"><em>Pathfinder Battles Iconic\
  \ Heroes Set 6</em></a>, which is now available in stores and here on Paizo.com!\
  \ This set is especially interesting in that it comes with one \"extra\" figure\
  \ to help us round out the complete list of iconic characters revealed in Pathfinder\
  \ RPG hardcovers up to the <a href=\"/products/btpy978v\"><em>Pathfinder RPG Advanced\
  \ Class Guide</em></a>!</p> \n     <p>Check 'em out!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n      <a href=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/Secondary/WZK71783-Quinn.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/Secondary/WZK71783-Quinn_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Here we've got Quinn, Human Investigator, one of my\
  \ absolute favorites from the entire <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles/iconicHeroes\"\
  >Iconic Heroes</a> line (the other one probably being <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lif8\"\
  >Oloch</a>, from <a href=\"/products/btpy9f9p\"><em>Iconic Heroes Set 5</em></a>.\
  \ From his perfectly applied eyes and facial details to the huge amount of well-painted\
  \ gear, this figure has it all. It's also amazingly versatile, and can double easily\
  \ as numerous characters, from spellcasters to rogues to swashbucklers, from heroes\
  \ to villains alike. Quinn is COOOOOL, and I'm thrilled to add him not just to the\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles/iconicHeroes\">Iconic Heroes</a> line, but also to\
  \ my own personal miniatures collection!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n\
  \      <a href=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/Secondary/WZK71783-Feyia.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/Secondary/WZK71783-Feyia_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>This is the one we've been waiting for ever since the\
  \ original Feiya, Human Witch turned out something short of everyone's expectations\
  \ back in the <a href=\"/products/btpy92s9\"><em>Reign of Winter</em></a> set. The\
  \ recent replacement figure WizKids randomly inserted into <a href=\"/products/btpy9er4\"\
  ><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a> boosters was a minor improvement, but really\
  \ revealed that the culprit was a weak face sculpt overall. There just aren't enough\
  \ details on that face for painters to pick out, resulting in, well, let's just\
  \ call her a \"very happy\" Feiya and leave it at that. I'm personally very happy\
  \ to reveal that the second time is the charm (thanks in no small part to the shift\
  \ to digital sculpting), and this version of Feiya suffers from none of the problems\
  \ that marred her first appearance. Her face looks fantastic this time around, and\
  \ her new \"in the middle of battle\" pose suits, her, as well. When you're trying\
  \ to decide which witch to use, I think you'll find this is a witch worth making\
  \ a switch. Ahem.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/Secondary/WZK71783-Daji.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/Secondary/WZK71783-Daji_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Of course, a witch isn't much without her familiar,\
  \ so in this set we've also included Daji, Feiya's fox familiar. Daji has a neat\
  \ mid-stride pose that differentiates him from the previous <a href=\"/products/btpy96rb\"\
  >Fox</a> miniature in <a href=\"/products/btpy92s9\"><em>Reign of Winter</em></a>,\
  \ and honesty the two foxes go together well for an animal encounter, if you don't\
  \ want to use it as a familiar. Either way, folks seem to love them some animals,\
  \ and <a href=\"/products/btpy9fyt\"><em>Iconic Heroes Set 6</em></a> contains one\
  \ of the most lovable to date.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a\
  \ href=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/Secondary/WZK71783-Seltyiel.jpg\"><img\
  \ src=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/Secondary/WZK71783-Seltyiel_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Do you like your men bare-chested and a bit on the\
  \ \"goth\" side? This figure is the answer to all of your (probably very adult-oriented)\
  \ dreams! Seltyiel has his big magus sword ready for a skillful attack, and you\
  \ just know his thin lips are about to let loose an absolutely cutting insult. I'm\
  \ currently writing this character in our <a href=\"/products/btpy9gs3\"><em>Pathfinder:\
  \ Hollow Mountain</em></a> comic from Dynamite, and having a blast. He's pretty\
  \ much a villain (or, if you prefer, an \"anti-hero\") in the comic, but on your\
  \ game table he can be whatever you want him to be. Good guy, bad guy, maybe a little\
  \ of both...</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/Secondary/WZK71783-Lem.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/Secondary/WZK71783-Lem_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Back in the ancient days, when the then very small\
  \ Paizo editorial staff was brainstorming iconic characters, we decided that we\
  \ wanted our iconic halfling bard to have awesome sideburns. \"You know,\" we said,\
  \ \"like Lemmy in Mötorhead.\" When his illustration came in, I think it was James\
  \ L. Sutter who suggested \"Why don't we just call him Lem?\" And a legend was born.\
  \ I really appreciate the way this version of Lem, Halfling Bard is captured mid-song.\
  \ Very useful for a bard figure. Alternatively, pair Lem with the Dwarf Bard drummer,\
  \ the Half-Elf Bard violinist, and some Dancing Girls from <a href=\"/products/btpy9er4\"\
  ><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a>, and you've got a ready-made concert!</p> \n\
  \     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/Secondary/WZK71783-Reiko.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Secondary/WZK71783-Reiko_180.jpeg\"></a>\n     </div>\
  \ \n     <p>We couldn't finish the Iconic Heroes sets without our two Asian-inspired\
  \ iconics from <a href=\"/products/btpy8mcz\"><em>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat</em></a>,\
  \ of course! These guys don't get quite the same love as our standard iconics, largely\
  \ because they represent sub-classes rather than full core classes, but that's pedantic\
  \ inside baseball talk. They're still super cool, and they deserve some love. Reiko,\
  \ Human Ninja comes in a sweet battle pose, a chain dangling between her two blades.\
  \ She's definitely a cool killer you don't want to run into in a dark alley. But\
  \ if you do, at least you'll now have a miniature to commemorate the encounter!</p>\
  \ \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/Secondary/WZK71783-Hayato.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/Secondary/WZK71783-Hayato_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Last up this week is Hayato, Human Samurai! With his\
  \ banner, lamellar armor, helmet, and more, Hayato is perhaps the most detailed\
  \ of artist Wayne Reynolds's many iconic characters. I'm happy to report that WizKids\
  \ is up to the challenge, and have delivered a fantastic rendition of the character\
  \ in <a href=\"/products/btpy9fyt\"><em>Iconic Heroes Set 6</em></a>. Their efforts,\
  \ as Hayato himself might say, are most honorable.</p> \n     <p>All seven figures\
  \ come with unique cards for use with the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame\"\
  >Pathfinder Adventure Card Game</a>, and all are produced at the highest possible\
  \ quality allowed by the manufacturing process. Now that we've completed all of\
  \ the Iconic Heroes sets in our original plan, I can say that I am very proud of\
  \ the work both Paizo and WizKids have put into making these among the finest prepainted\
  \ plastic gaming figures ever produced. We've done, I think, an excellent job, and\
  \ have set quality standards it will be difficult for anyone else to match or exceed.\
  \ But we'll keep trying, of course!</p> \n     <p>But wait, I can hear you gasp.\
  \ Is set 6 really the final Iconic Heroes set?</p> \n     <p>That, my friends, remains\
  \ to be seen. We've had a few discussions with WizKids about what comes next, but\
  \ nothing has yet been decided officially. I can say that WizKids is watching sales\
  \ of these sets very closely, so if you'd like to see more of them, the best possible\
  \ thing you can do is purchase the ones we've already released. We'd all love to\
  \ produce figures for the <a href=\"/products/btpy9egu\"><em>Occult Adventures</em></a>\
  \ iconics, or both versions of the vigilante class from <a href=\"/products/btpy9hj7\"\
  ><em>Ultimate Intrigue</em></a> (or heck, maybe even a <a href=\"/products/btpy8j5w\"\
  >\"We Be Goblins\"</a> or \"Iconic Villains\" set), but those decisions are not\
  \ entirely up to me—they're up to the market.</p> \n     <p>I'm at ToyFair in New\
  \ York City this weekend, where I'll be discussing this and even more diabolical\
  \ plans in person with our friends at WizKids. I hope to be able to report big things\
  \ soon!</p> \n     <p>But more importantly, we're very very close to the announcement\
  \ of the next big set, and that means we start the preview train all over again\
  \ here, every Friday.</p> \n     <p>Don't forget to bring lots of coal so we can\
  \ keep this engine HOT!</p> \n     <p>Until then, I remain,</p> \n     <p>Erik Mona<br>\
