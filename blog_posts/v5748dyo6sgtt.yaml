  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Pregenerated characters.\
  \ Those iconic heroes who often serve as the first introduction for people to play\
  \ Pathfinder. They’re here. Or at least, the first batch of them. The level 1 versions\
  \ of Amiri, Ezren, Fumbus, Harsk, Kyra, Lem, Lini, Merisiel, Sajan, Seoni, and Valeros,\
  \ along with the level 5 versions of Amiri, Ezren, Fumbus, Kyra, Merisiel, and Valeros.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Why only 6 level 5s and no other levels, you might ask? It’s because\
  \ pregens are cursed. I’m telling you, disappearing documents, spreadsheets randomly\
  \ overwriting themselves, John forgetting that he’d put “Prettiest Kitty” as a placeholder\
  \ for Droogami’s background until it showed up on his desk for final approvals (who\
  \ were we to question John’s knowledge and experience?). The process definitely\
  \ seemed like a comedy of errors at times, yet it also included many invaluable\
  \ collaboration and review steps that resulted in 18 exceptional characters.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>But they’re <b><a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01zt5?Community-Use-Package-PF2E-Iconics-Pregenerated-Characters\"\
  >here</a></b>, and they’re ready to throw down PF2 style! The 5th-level iconics\
  \ are also going to be taking on Pathfinder Society Scenario #1-00: Origins of the\
  \ Open Road, premiering at GenCon. And if you’re not going to be playing 1-00, or\
  \ if you want to spend a little time at 1st level and get used to the new rules,\
  \ we’ve got a repeatable quest and scenarios galore to try out all the iconic characters.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>How did Sajan get Tiger Style, a ki power, <i>and</i> proficiency with\
  \ his temple sword at 1st level you might ask? Let’s just say it’s humanly possible.\
  \ Why does Fumbus get more adorable every time you pick up his character sheet?\
  \ I don’t have an answer for that. But I <i>can</i> tell you that Valeros has traded\
  \ out his Sudden Charge feat from the playtest and has rediscovered his two-weapon\
  \ fighting skills, now blending shield boss and longsword for all your bashing and\
  \ slashing needs!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/073119_Linni.jpg\"\

  \ \n     </div> \n     <p>Have fun everyone! We’ll be looking at rolling out pregenerated\
  \ characters to cover a few more tiers of play in the months ahead, so just enjoy\
  \ these heroes for the time being and before you know it we’ll have a whole new\
  \ batch for you to poke, prod, and give feedback on. Speaking of, please send all\
  \ feedback directly to: <a href=\"mailto:john.compton@paizo.com\">john.compton@paizo.com</a></p>\
