  \ release, <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq0250x?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Pathfinder-Society-Guide\"\
  ><em>Lost Omens Pathfinder Society Guide</em></a>, is hot off the presses, and the\
  \ character options from this book have now been sanctioned for use in Organized\
  \ Play! Please see the updates to our ongoing <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh3j?Pathfinder-Society-Character-Options\"\
  >Character Options blog</a> for these newest additions.</p> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/e3f54f34-ed32-4444-8d09-e3e287043600/101520_Poppet.png\"\

  \ a small stick with a bell as a staff. Art by Mirco Paganessi\"></a>\n      <p\
  \ style=\"font-size: 13px;\">A poppet is one of several new options available for\
  \ your spellcaster’s familiar; Art by Mirco Paganessi</p> \n      <p>This was an\
  \ exciting opportunity for the Organized Play and Lost Omens departments to work\
  \ together in presenting the story of the Pathfinder Society’s adventures, as well\
  \ as new player options that your Pathfinder can learn as they interact with the\
  \ leaders and lodges of the Society. Since the options in this book revolve around\
  \ the Pathfinder Society, it's only natural that many of them are automatically\
  \ granted out the gate to agents of the Society—that’s you! Have you learned some\
  \ techniques from the greats, like pirate captain Stella Fane’s signature stance\
  \ to throw playing cards with as much force as daggers? Or maybe you’ve picked up\
  \ a special Arcadian wayfinder variant that can flit off to spy or scout?</p> \n\
  \      <br clear=\"all\"> \n      <p>Some options require a bit more training or\
  \ specialist knowledge, or are more common at specific lodges. You can gain access\
  \ to many of these through Chronicle Boons, which you can find by logging into your\
  \ <a href=\"https://paizo.com/organizedPlay/myAccount\">My Organized Play account</a>\
  \ and navigating to the “Boons” tab. These boons cost 0 Achievement Points and can\
  \ be acquired once you’ve completed one or more specific scenarios. This means that\
  \ as your Pathfinder completes scenarios around Golarion, they’ll naturally gain\
  \ access to options from the regions and venture-captains that their adventures\
  \ have taken them to. For instance, if you work with Venture-Captain Bjersig Torrsen\
  \ out of snowy Iceferry Lodge, you may be able to acquire a pair of <em>magical\
  \ snowshoes of the long trek</em>. We’ve gone back into some scenarios from Year\
  \ 1 and created Chronicle Boons to grant access to thematically appropriate items,\
  \ so check this out and see if there are any you might have!</p> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/7fcb107c-31dd-46b4-b489-c4adca02b581/101520_HummingbirdWayfinder.png\"\

  \ Pathfinders, but that doesn’t mean there’s only one kind; Art by Mirco Paganessi\
  \ </p> \n      <p>Lastly, the four Pathfinder factions each have their own set of\
  \ specialist gear that they’ve developed—for instance, the militant and defense-focused\
  \ Vigilant Seal have created a special alchemical item to disperse cold iron or\
  \ silver in a mist to drive off monsters. Your character can gain access to these\
  \ special sets of faction gear by accumulating reputation with those factions and\
  \ then taking the relevant Game Reward. These, like Chronicle Boons, are a type\
  \ of reward that costs 0 Achievement Points and can be found in your My Organized\
  \ Play account, the main difference being that they aren’t tied to specific scenarios.\
  \ As your character builds reputation with each faction, they’ll be able to gain\
  \ this specialized equipment.</p> \n      <br clear=\"all\"> \n      <p>If you did\
