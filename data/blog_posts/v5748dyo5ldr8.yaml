  \ had been sitting on the grand staircase's lower steps, and jumped to his feet\
  \ as Bhax and another of the servants hauled open the foyer doors. For a moment,\
  \ Luma thought he might come down to wrap his arms around her. When he reached her,\
  \ stopped short, and put his hands on hips, she saw the absurdity of her assumption.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"What are you smiling at?\" he asked.</p> \n    <p>\"I'm not,\" Luma\
  \ answered, realizing that she was, a little. Trying not to smirk made it worse.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Iskola tried to steer her around him. \"Let it rest, Arrus ...\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Rest? We can hash this out here, or in the squad room, but we have\
  \ to— Luma, what did you tell him?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Nothing.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Did\
  \ you genuinely say nothing, or did you banter with him and trip yourself up?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"There was nothing to say. He thinks one of you ordered me to murder\
  \ Khonderian, and that I did so, on behest of a client.\"</p> \n    <p>\"So you\
  \ didn't do as I told you.\"</p> \n    <p>\"When we got there,\" said Iskola, \"\
  we found Grobaras on the verge of apoplexy. From that, I judge Luma's performance\
  \ more than adequate. Now let her wash up.\"</p> \n    <p>Arrus paced. \"So did\
  \ you succeed in drawing him out?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Someone saw me following Khonderian,\"\
  \ said Luma. \"That's all he has.\"</p> \n    <p>\"And how did you let yourself\
  \ be seen?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Can't say,\" Luma shrugged. \"It's tough enough doing\
  \ a one-person tail and not having your target see you. I don't recall being made,\
  \ but then I wouldn't, would I?\"</p> \n    <p>\"You're awfully impertinent, given\
  \ the cost of this failure.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Maybe compared to the threat of a golem\
  \ sawing my limbs off, being second-guessed by you isn't so terrifying.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>Arrus stopped pacing. \"What's that supposed to mean?\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  The mouse has a point,\" Iskola said.</p> \n    <p>Arrus wheeled on her. \"You're\
  \ her defender now?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Arrus, calm yourself.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I don't\
  \ need to be defended,\" Luma blurted. \"I didn't fail. An operation threw a wheel.\
  \ Happens all the time. To each and every one of us. It's how you recover that counts.\
  \ And I recovered fine.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Don't shriek at us, Luma,\" Arrus said.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"No, I'm going to say this and you're going to listen. I resign as family\
  \ scapegoat. No longer will I accept this.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Accept what?\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"You know very well. I comported myself perfectly in there. Same as you\
  \ would have. I even have a lead.\"</p> \n    <p>\"A lead?\" Arrus asked.</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"This thing, it has something to do with golems.\"</p> \n    <p>\"What\
  \ do you mean?\"</p> \n    <p>\"I don't know yet, I sense it ...the lord-mayor has\
  \ a golem bodyguard, there's a golem uprising in Bridgeward ...it hasn't come together\
  \ yet in my head, but it's all part of the same complex melody ...\"</p> \n    <p>Arrus\
  \ threw up his hands. \"I'm sure that will hold up at the Justice Court. You hear\
  \ the city sing to you ...\"</p> \n    <p>Luma pointed at Iskola. \"My magic is\
  \ as real as hers. That's exactly what I mean. You're constantly denigrating me.\
  \ All of you, but you more than everyone, Arrus. Because I let you. Well, this is\
  \ my notice to the lot of you. Starting today, it stops.\"</p> \n    <p>Arrus turned\
  \ to Iskola. \"And I'm the one who has to calm himself?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Let's all\
  \ of us pause for breath,\" Iskola responded. \"This is what Grobaras wants. For\
  \ us to turn on each other.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Who hired us to track Khonderian?\"\
  \ Luma asked her.</p> \n    <p>Iskola passed her outer cloak to Bhax, who bore it\
  \ away to the garderobe. \"As soon as it's possible, I'll tell you. You have my\
  \ word.\"</p> \n    <p>Luma pursued her out of the foyer and into the ballroom.\
  \ The floor squeaked under her feet. \"That's not good enough.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  It will have to be,\" Iskola answered.</p> \n    <p>Luma grabbed her and pulled\
  \ her around. \"I'm the one they're fixing to stick up on the gibbet!\"</p> \n \
  \   <p>Iskola pulled her arm away. \"I'll talk to the client. It will take some\
  \ persuading.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I don't care what you tell the client.\"</p> \n \
  \   <p>\"Certain of our patrons find you an uneasy presence.\"</p> \n    <p>\"What's\
  \ that supposed to mean?\"</p> \n    <p>\"You're spooky. You lurk. You think the\
  \ city talks to you.\"</p> \n    <p>\"It does.\"</p> \n    <p>\"And nobody likes\
  \ a girl who can steal their thoughts.\"</p> \n    <p>Luma stormed up the steps,\
  \ headed for her father's room. This time, Yandine was nowhere in sight. Silently\
  \ she turned the latch and peeked in. Her father sat propped against the head of\
  \ his bed, a ledger in his lap. With a jittering finger he followed its entries.\
  \ If he'd heard the argument through his chamber's thick walls, he betrayed no sign\
  \ of it.</p> \n    <p>She slipped inside. \"Father,\" she said.</p> \n    <p>Randred's\
  \ features lit up. \"You're back,\" he said. His expression clouded. \"They mistreated\
  \ you.\"</p> \n    <p>Shaking her head, Luma sat on the mattress' edge and wrapped\
  \ her arms around him. He smelled of camphor. \"Iskola showed up with political\
  \ reinforcements before that could happen.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Then that unpaid mission\
  \ I upbraided Iskola for has more than justified itself,\" he said. \"I owe her\
  \ an apology.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I am grateful for it,\" Luma said.</p> \n    <p>Before\
  \ she could go on, Randred insisted on knowing all that had happened: in the coach,\
  \ at the prison, before Grobaras. Luma's efforts to quickly summarize events fell\
  \ before his frequent interjections. She gave him every detail.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  We've won the merest respite,\" he said, when he had wrung it all from her. \"Grobaras\
  \ believes he has you. He has always disliked us, as he does any force in the city\
  \ outside of his control. Only the true killer, delivered to him on a platter, will\
  \ move him from his assumption. No one will do this for us.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Indeed,\"\
  \ Luma said.</p> \n    <p>\"But you must confine yourself here and let the others\
  \ take point. Anything you do might be construed as cause to seize you again. And\
  \ then all the Urtilia Scarnettis in Magnimar won't save you from the torturer's\
  \ slab.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Father, Grobaras doesn't just want me. It's all of us.\
  \ He kept asking whether it was you who ordered Khonderian's murder, or Iskola.\
  \ Whichever of us goes out will be exposed.\"</p> \n    <p>\"But you most of all,\
  \ Mouse.\"</p> \n    <p>\"We need someone who can sneak, who can pry open loose\
  \ lips. Ontor can't do it alone.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Then I'll pull in dirt-sorters\
  \ from other squads.\" He clutched his side.</p> \n    <p>\"You're unwell,\" she\
  \ said.</p> \n    <p>\"It's nothing.\"</p> \n    <p>She considered telling him that\
  \ she knew. And she would, soon. One battle at a time, she told herself. \"I would\
  \ never question your authority, Father.\"</p> \n    <p>He gave her a wan smile.\
  \ \"Which means you're about to.\"</p> \n    <p>Luma clutched his hand. It was cold.\
  \ \"I've come to a decision. If I'm belittled around here, it's my doing. I'm a\
  \ Derexhi, and an adult. Older than them. As capable as any of them. The only way\
  \ to earn their respect is by standing up to them. Starting now.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Starting with what?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Iskola wants me off the streets, too. I'll\
  \ be defying that order. If it means defying yours, too ...\"</p> \n    <p>Randred\
  \ dropped the ledger to the floor and held her. \"Belay what I just said. I was\
  \ talking nonsense. I've been suffering a touch of the rheum and it's fuddled my\
  \ head. Of course you must act. Whatever the others say. This is Magnimar. No one\
  \ here will give you respect if you fear to seize it.\"</p> \n    <p>Luma broke\
  \ the embrace. \"It is also Derexhi House. Where the same maxim applies.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>Informing no one, Luma left early in the morning for the Triodea. She walked\
  \ along the Avenue of Hours, where the warm winds of early spring came out to greet\
  \ her. Gulls circled overhead; she felt their hunger and greed. Thinning clouds\
  \ skidded through the sky, transforming it from gray to blue. In these signs—well,\
  \ except for the gulls, gulls were a constant and didn't mean anything—she chose\
  \ to find an omen. Her standing up for herself, and behaving like a woman instead\
  \ of a girl, would be good for all. They would kick and complain; to adjust one's\
  \ thinking is never pleasant or easy. When all the fuss was over, they would see\
  \ the advantage in adding a full, equal partner to the squad. They would trust her\
  \ better, and she, them. To fight without trust is to invite defeat.</p> \n    <p>As\
  \ she trekked on, the sun rose higher. Traffic trickled on the avenue, then grew\
  \ thicker. She passed ox-sellers, laborers, gilded carriages, bird-catchers, chimney\
  \ sweeps, and a flag-draped cart carrying a troupe of traveling players. She ducked\
  \ a wandering fortune-teller, warned a carter that a wheel was coming off, and stole\
  \ a pickpocket's purse when he tried to take hers. Its contents she doled out to\
  \ child beggars and blind men. </p> \n    <p>By the time the Avenue of Hours opened\
  \ into the plaza housing the Triodea, the citysong had reached a peak, high and\
  \ clear. Nowhere to Luma's senses was its sublimity purer than here. Mid-morning\
  \ sun shone on the tripartite structure. It intensified on the long, white hangar\
  \ of the Grand Stage and dulled on the gray surface of the adjoining concert hall.\
  \ Bright-breasted birds gathered atop the reaching awning of the rooftop stage.\
  \ The plaza, called the Starsilver, glittered beneath Luma's feet. In place of cobblestones,\
  \ it was surfaced by tiles inlaid with pieces of reflective abalone shell. A well-scrubbed\
  \ work crew took its unhurried time searching out broken tiles. When they found\
  \ one in need of replacement, they gathered around in murmured colloquy. After prolonged\
  \ contemplation, the crew leader nodded to an aide, who dipped a brush into a pot\
  \ of soluble red paint, hunched down, and encircled the offending tile.</p> \n \
  \   <p>She strode over to them, greeting the crew captain by name: \"Mordh!\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Luma,\" he answered.</p> \n    <p>Luma passed around the last of the\
  \ coins she'd taken from the pickpocket, which the tilemen pocketed without comment.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Aren't you s'posed to be in the Hells?\" Mordh asked.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  I like to think otherwise.\" She kept up with the crew as it resumed its hunt for\
  \ faulty tiles. Luma spotted a cracked one before they did. They gathered around\
  \ to peer at it. \"You know a gnome named Noole? He frequents the performance halls.\
  \ Fancies himself a poet.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I never asked him his name,\" said Mordh,\
  \ \"but a fellow matching that description comes 'round now and again, to practice\
  \ his quatrains on us.\"</p> \n    <p>\"And cadge coins,\" added another of the\
  \ tilemen, a tall man who wore his thinning hair close to the scalp.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  That too,\" said Mordh. \"I prefer that to the verses.\"</p> \n    <p>\"No,\" argued\
  \ a gaunt third tileman, \"the poems is good.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Seen him lately?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Mordh pointed across the plaza, to the doorway of one of the taverns\
  \ installed in the Grand Stage's right flank. \"Went in there an hour ago, thereabouts.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Luma left them with a wave of thanks. The gaunt tileman squatted to\
  \ paint a red circle around the tile she'd pointed out. She wended her unobtrusive\
  \ way through the plaza's sprawling foot traffic. At the tavern entrance, she held\
  \ herself so that she seemed to be gazing up at the rooftop stage. In fact, she\
  \ spotted Noole at a corner table, a flagon at his left elbow and a piece of vellum\
  \ stretched out before him. He held his pen at an abstracted angle. She eased into\
  \ the tavern. </p> \n    <p>The gnome spotted her and bolted. His table toppled,\
  \ taking tankard, inkwell, pen, and poem with it. He dashed for the kitchen entrance.\
  \ Luma followed. As she passed through the swinging doors, a jar hurtled at her\
  \ head. She ducked; it hit the wall behind her, shattering. A cloud of flour puffed\
  \ out from it. Now coated in white powder, Luma sprinted for Noole, who dove out\
  \ a service door into the Grand Hall. The tavern's cook, swearing in the dwarven\
  \ language, hurtled at her, waving his butcher's knife. She drew her sickle and\
  \ smacked it out of his hand. The knife flew end over end before splashing into\
  \ a pot of hot oil. Scalding droplets rained on the cook; Luma was already through\
  \ the door.</p> \n    <p>Noole fled with surprising speed through the concert hall's\
  \ plush lobby. He'd knocked a lantern from its sconce; panicked servants rushed\
  \ to douse its flames before they spread. Luma sped past them. Her hand thrust into\
  \ her pouch of spell objects, now replenished. Each of the vial tops had its own\
  \ distinct texture, allowing her to quickly find the one with the cricket leg. She\
  \ reached into the citysong for the sound of the chirping, jumping bugs, and pilfered\
  \ a touch of their magic. </p> \n    <p>Luma jumped, and the city propelled her\
  \ into the air. She grazed the dripping crystals of the great hall's chandeliers,\
  \ leaving them rocking and tinkling. Breathing deep, she braced for the coming landing.\
  \ </p> \n    <p>Her outstretched feet struck Noole in the back. She rolled, hitting\
  \ the pedestal of a statue to a long-dead contralto. She made her way up, watching\
  \ Noole as he rose and drew a rapier. Her own weapon lay on the rug a few feet away;\
  \ she'd dropped it to avoid cutting herself as she landed. Feigning dismay, she\
  \ let him come at her midsection. The thin sword jabbed skillfully at her. With\
  \ equal aplomb, she evaded the thrust. Continuing the motion, she snatched up her\
  \ sickle and dove at her opponent. He kept her at bay with a feint of his blade.\
  \ They circled one another, Luma leaving ghostings of flour wherever she stepped.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"I can't guess what you want with me,\" the gnome said, \"but I want\
  \ nothing to do with you.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Drop your weapon and I'll explain,\"\
  \ Luma answered.</p> \n    <p>He held it out as if ready to let it go, then lunged.\
  \ The blade caught Luma on the side of the neck. It hurt, but she could tell the\
  \ wound was only superficial. She swiped at his legs with her sickle; he hopped\
  \ back with flamboyant ease. Adopting a perfect fencing stance, he waited for her\
  \ to come at him.</p> \n    <p>His moves so far revealed one fighting style disguised\
  \ as another. Noole added flourishes to what was, at its core, a cautious waiting\
  \ game of precisely timed blows. He was waiting for Luma to make a mistake he could\
  \ capitalize on. In this, and in his general deftness and quick reactions, he favored\
  \ an approach to combat that was also Luma's. One patient, calculating scrapper\
  \ faced another.</p> \n    <p>This could go on all day.</p> \n    <p>\"What was\
  \ your business with Khonderian?\" Luma asked.</p> \n    <p>\"That name is naught\
  \ but a distant wisp of fading recollection.\"</p> \n    <p>She faked a strike;\
  \ he didn't fall for it. \"Set aside your perfumed words, poet.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  It reflects ill on you, to say ‘poet' like it's an insult.\" He faked a strike;\
  \ she didn't fall for it.</p> \n    <p>\"I saw him pay you off in Bridgeward, on\
  \ the street of taverns. What for?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Surely you've mistaken me for\
  \ another gnome of equal handsomeness.\"</p> \n    <p>White light filled the lobby.\
  \ Luma glanced back to see what had changed, at the same time anticipating and deflecting\
  \ an expected blow. She caught the gnome's rapier in the crook of her sickle and\
  \ twisted it from his hand.</p> \n    <p>Workmen had opened one of the large entry\
  \ doors to toss out the still-smoking rug. Luma decided on a stratagem. She shouted\
  \ with inarticulate, feigned bloodlust and came at the gnome with apparent recklessness.\
  \ Noole sidestepped her; she pretended to trip and fall into the wall, her sickle\
  \ lodging in its flocked surface.</p> \n    <p>If the gnome turned out to be more\
  \ interested in finishing her than in escaping, this would prove a terrible error.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>But Luma was right: he took the opportunity not to strike at her, but\
  \ to scoop up his rapier and sprint for the open doors.</p> \n    <p>This gave her\
  \ the time and distance she needed to call on another of the city's boons. She attuned\
  \ herself to the crunch of pebbles and grains of sand underfoot. She called to bits\
  \ of gravel strewn on rooftops and trapped in their eaves. Through the citysong\
  \ she plucked stones from the soles of boots. All of these she gathered together\
  \ in an enfolding, spiraling wind.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\">\n     <a href=\"\

  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n     <br> Noole is always the center of attention.\n    </div>\
  \ \n    <p>As Noole reached the threshold, a thick hail of stone and gravel did\
  \ too. It struck him in the chest and face, sending him back on his heels. Stunned,\
  \ he tottered and fell. Luma, who was already running, jumped on him, a foot on\
  \ his emptied sword-hand and the curve of her sickle around his throat.</p> \n \
  \   <p>\"I can kill you, or buy you a drink,\" she said. \"Which will it be?\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>He twitched his mustache at her. \"It's not yet noon. So I'll stick to\
  \ ale.\"</p> \n    <p>The daytime house manager, kitted in a uniform of rich green\
  \ and velvet, hovered warily nearby. Luma handed him Noole's sword, daggers, and\
  \ throwing knives. \"You're going to hold on to these while the gentleman and I\
  \ repair for private conversation,\" she told the manager, who gulped in frightened\
  \ assent. She removed Noole's ensorceled rings, which substituted for armor, and\
  \ handed those over, too.</p> \n    <p>To her surprise, she found no burglar's kit\
  \ on his person. From his way of fighting, she'd pegged him as a footpad. Judging\
  \ from his accoutrements, the gnome was instead a swordsman—plain, though hardly\
  \ simple.</p> \n    <p>\"We'll return for these shortly,\" she told the manager.\
  \ \"If all goes well.\" Later she'd return to the tavern where her chase had wreaked\
  \ havoc and arrange for payment of damages. For the moment, she escorted Noole across\
  \ the plaza to a rival establishment, the Sock and Buskin. Around a central table,\
  \ actors half-heartedly recited lines, committing them to memory.</p> \n    <p>Noole\
  \ winced. \"Not The Inconstant Nymph again! What a chestnut!\" He cupped his hand\
  \ theatrically to the side of his mouth and shouted, \"Stage something new for once!\"\
  </p> \n    <p>The eldest of the actors, who held himself with an impresario's authority,\
  \ stood up. \"Cleave to your sonnets, hack!\"</p> \n    <p>Noole wandered toward\
  \ their table. \"You're not playing Donatio, surely. That part is thirty years too\
  \ young for you.\"</p> \n    <p>The impresario threw Noole the tines. Luma took\
  \ Noole by the arm and led him to a corner table.</p> \n    <p>Luma took the bench,\
  \ leaving Noole the chair, where his back would be exposed to the room. The gnome\
  \ settled in. \"A hail of stones. Never seen that one before.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Need I repeat the question?\"</p> \n    <p>\"You're not the one they say murdered\
  \ old Khonderian, are you?\"</p> \n    <p>Luma felt herself bridle.</p> \n    <p>Noole's\
  \ eyes glittered. \"You are, you are. Well, I daresay you don't seem the murdering\
  \ type. Else you'd have opened my throat too.\"</p> \n    <p>The barmaid, whose\
  \ blasé demeanor and overly painted face led Luma to think of her as a disappointed\
  \ ex-actress, ambled to their table.</p> \n    <p>\"I'll have a pint of Old Asmodeus,\
  \ and so will she,\" said Noole. \"And your cured meat plate, and your cheese plate,\
  \ and shall we say the pickle assortment?\" He cracked his fingers together.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"No drink for me,\" said Luma.</p> \n    <p>\"Have you had the Old Asmodeus?\"\
  \ Noole asked.</p> \n    <p>\"No.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Then she'll take the half-pint\
  \ and at least taste it,\" Noole told the barmaid, who shuffled off.</p> \n    <p>Luma\
  \ leaned in. \"I suppose I should ask if you killed Khonderian.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Me? Why would I?\"</p> \n    <p>\"What was he paying you for?\"</p> \n    <p>Noole\
  \ sighed. \"The life of a versifier can be at times a chancy one. Yet for all its\
  \ material deprivations, I am blessed with the chance to ascend and descend the\
  \ social ladder. Oft times in the same afternoon. Along the way, one picks up scraps—\
  sometimes a fine duck rillette, sometimes a pregnant rumor. \"</p> \n    <p>\"You\
  \ were his informant.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I prefer gossip. The other sounds impersonal.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"And what intelligence earned you that clinking purse the other night?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>The barmaid made her way over, carrying the first of the food plates.\
  \ Noole rubbed his hands together. \"I am no gentleman poet. To keep a roof over\
  \ my head, I must at times resort to the unconventional.\"</p> \n    <p>\"You were\
  \ squatting in a Qadiran trader's house in Grand Arch.\"</p> \n    <p>He popped\
  \ a chunk of blue cheese into his mouth. \"If only I had a critic who followed me\
  \ as avidly as you, my peach.\" He frowned. \"Don't blush, child. I mean nothing\
  \ by it.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Don't call me child.\"</p> \n    <p>\"At Grand Arch, did\
  \ you happen to notice any skulky characters about?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Across the\
  \ way from you.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Yes. A small troop of highly armed men and women,\
  \ their every furtive glance broadcasting ill intent. I crept over there one night,\
  \ as I am wont to do. They spoke with Korvosan accents. Alas, I heard little of\
  \ their discourse. They did have a map of the city up on the wall. Stuck there with\
  \ a dagger. A breach of squatter's etiquette, I must say.\"</p> \n    <p>Luma nibbled\
  \ absently on a piece of cured boar. \"And that's all you told Khonderian?\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"He wanted me to do some more creeping about. I left that open as a\
  \ possibility.\"</p> \n    <p>\"But never followed through?\"</p> \n    <p>\"The\
  \ muse led me elsewhere.\" He shoved the tankard, which she hadn't touched, toward\
  \ her. \"Try it. Strongly hopped, with a hint of persimmon.\"</p> \n    <p>She took\
  \ a grudging sip. \"Why go to the head of the lord-mayor's bodyguard? Why not the\
  \ lord justice?\"</p> \n    <p>\"My tittle-tattle is of a political nature, chiefly,\
  \ and of little interest to the law.\" He drained the last of his ale. \"Also, Khonderian\
  \ paid well. The city guard can scarcely afford blade polish.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  And you have no guess as to why Khonderian was killed?\"</p> \n    <p>He gestured\
  \ to the barmaid for another Old Asmodeus. \"It can't have anything to do with me.\
  \ Speaking of which, his departure leaves a gaping void in my future earnings. Surely\
  \ you Derexhi could stand to enlarge your network of informants.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  We cultivate unpaid sources.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Then I venture to say you're missing\
  \ a trick.\" With one swipe he cleared the meat plate of its olives. \"Let's talk\
  \ advance.\"</p> \n    <p>Luma stood. \"Let's go get your weapons back to you.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"My second tankard hasn't arrived. Listen, I hate to argue from need.\
  \ I can impose on dear old Lady Khedre for a week or so in her servant's quarters,\
  \ but do so hesitantly. Ours is an association that wilts under the heat of prolonged\
  \ proximity. Khonderian's payment was not so generous as you may have assumed ...\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Luma paid the barmaid. \"Drink up, gnome. I'll tell the manager he's\
  \ free to give you your sword when you come to ask for it.\"</p> \n    <p><a href=\"\
