  \   </div> \n   <h1>Pathfinder Battles Preview: Uncommon Courtesy</h1> \n   <p class=\"\
  date\">Friday, October 21, 2011</p> \n   <p>I’m pleased to report that I have now\
  \ seen preproduction samples of all 41 miniatures in the Pathfinder Battles <a href=\"\
  /store/byCompany/w/wizKids/featuredBrands/pathfinderMiniatures/v5748btpy8mq6\">Heroes\
  \ &amp; Monsters</a> set, and I am thrilled with how they look! At long last we\
  \ have discovered the “perfect” goblin skin tone, and the big meaty Ettin finally\
  \ has the proper ink wash to make him a truly menacing brute. Things are really\
  \ coming together, and folks around the Paizo office are blown away by the quality\
  \ of the sculpts and paint jobs of the entire line. The commons in particular are\
  \ amazingly impressive, with far better paint jobs than most gamers are used to\
  \ at that rarity. WizKids has done a tremendous job both in the initial execution,\
  \ and in keeping up with a bewildering amount of changes and suggestions from Paizo\
  \ aimed at making these minis as close to perfect as possible.</p> \n   <p>To that\
  \ end, we’ve been shaking up the rarity scheme a bit, so while I was planning to\
  \ reveal the entire uncommon list today, we’re going to have to wait another week\
  \ since a few minis are moving around and I don’t want to reveal anything that might\
  \ change later.</p> \n   <p>But I do want to share some uncommon images with you!\
  \ As I explained <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lcqa\">last week</a>, we see the\
  \ uncommon rarity as the perfect landing point for player character miniatures (the\
  \ “heroes” in <a href=\"/store/byCompany/w/wizKids/featuredBrands/pathfinderMiniatures/v5748btpy8mq6\"\
  >Heroes &amp; Monsters</a>). While everyone needs multiple orcs and goblins, you\
  \ probably don’t need a whole army of human rangers or dwarf clerics or what have\
  \ you.</p> \n   <p>Today’s blog shows off three of the uncommons (that <i>won’t</i>\
  \ be changing rarities) no one outside the office has seen yet. Two of them are\
  \ player character types, while the third is a creature you’ll use again and again.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Our first miniature this week is the Dwarf Fighter, a doughty dude in\
  \ plate armor and a fancy winged helmet. If you’ve got a copy of the <a href=\"\
  /store/games/roleplayingGames/p/pathfinderRPG/paizo/pathfinderChronicles/v5748btpy8ief\"\
  ><i>Inner Sea World Guide</i></a> you probably recognize this guy from the back\
  \ cover. He means business!</p> \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    <a href=\"\
  /image/content/Blog/102111_DwarfFighter_360.jpeg\"><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/102111_DwarfFighter_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n   </div> \n   <p>Next up is our Half-Elf Cleric, in this case\
  \ a crusading warrior of Iomedae. I really like the way WizKids emblazoned her holy\
  \ symbol on her tabard. And since she’s using a sword and wearing plate mail armor,\
  \ this miniature easily doubles as a fighter or paladin.</p> \n   <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n    <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/102111_HalfElfCleric_360.jpeg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/102111_HalfElfCleric_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\
  \   </div> \n   <p>Last up this week is a nasty Venomous Snake, whose image comes\
  \ straight out of the <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8auu\"><i>Pathfinder RPG\
  \ Bestiary</i></a>. A bright red coat is nature’s way of saying “I am going to murder\
  \ you,” and it’ll be fun to watch your players squirm like Indiana Jones when this\
  \ little guy hits the table.</p> \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    <a href=\"\
  /image/content/Blog/102111_VenomousSnake_360.jpeg\"><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/102111_VenomousSnake_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n   </div> \n   <p>That’s it for previews this week! But here\
  \ we are at the end of the post, and I can’t spoil that uncommon list I was planning\
  \ to, and I feel terrible! So, in order to make up for this egregious slight, here’\
  s a list of a few rares in the set that we haven’t previously announced!</p> \n\
  \   <p>Gargoyle<br> Half-Orc Barbarian<br> Spectre<br> Werewolf<br> Minotaur<br>\
  \ Ogre<br></p> \n   <p>There are a lot more rares than that, but I’ve got to hold\
  \ onto some of my cards. The set doesn’t come out until December, and we’ve got\
  \ plenty more blogs to go before the set releases!</p> \n   <p>So let me know if\
  \ there are other topics you’d like me to cover on these Friday blogs, and I’ll\
  \ do my best to do so!</p> \n   <p>Cheers!</p> \n   <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p>\
