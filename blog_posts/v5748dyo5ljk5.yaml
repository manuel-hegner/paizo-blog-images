  \ announced our revised <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ljjj?Announcing-the-Regional-Support-Program\"\
  >Retail Support Program</a> to provide boon support to public, non-convention events.\
  \ Linda and I are busily outlining and assigning the rest of Season 8, we've locked\
  \ in Season 9, Linda's made tremendous strides in updating our FAQ, and we're preparing\
  \ the next batch of scenario product pagesâ€”including at least one surprise for an\
  \ upcoming convention. The team's also enjoyed incorporating significant crossovers\
  \ between the <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety\">Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild</a>\
  \ and the <a href=\"/pfsacg\">Pathfinder Society Adventure Card Guild</a>, including\
  \ some fun Adventure Card Guild developments to the Scarab Sages narrative in the\
  \ ongoing <a href=\"/pfsacg/products/season3\">Season of Plundered Tombs</a>. On\
  \ top of that, we're busily flying around the country to meet with organized play\
  \ communities in person, with Tonya having attended <a href=\"http://dundracon.com\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">DunDraCon in San Ramon, CA</a> this past weekend and Mark and\
  \ Linda attending <a href=\"http://totalcon.com\" target=\"_blank\">TotalCon in\
  \ Marlborough, MA</a> next weekend. On top of that, I've been helping out on several\
  \ cross-department collaborations that I imagine we'll announce a few months from\
  \ now.</p> \n     <p>During this busy time, we're fortunate to have several guest\
  \ developers helping us with scenario development: Thurston \"Thursty\" Hillman\
  \ and Ron Lundeen, both veteran authors and familiar with the intricacies of Pathfinder\
  \ Society. We're happy to have them collaborating with our in-house developers,\
  \ and you'll find them featured prominently in the credits for recent scenarios.</p>\

  \     </div> \n     <p>Speaking of scenarios, we have two great ones due out this\
  \ Wednesday. The first is <a href=\"/products/btpy9qc9?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-814-To-Seal-the-Shadow\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-14: To Seal the Shadow</em></a> by the talented\
  \ Jason Keeley. Especially when we've introduced new races to the campaign, I've\
  \ really enjoyed dedicating a scenario to meet a representative member of that species\
  \ or visit a significant settlement. We've done so with nagajis, a samsaran, a kitsune,\
  \ and even a bit for tengus, but the wayangs have enjoyed only a few paragraphs\
  \ of ethnographic exploration so far. For more than a year I've been looking for\
  \ the right time and right author to travel to Inahiyi, the hub of wayang culture\
  \ in Minata, and Jason did a great job presenting a major festival that the PCs\
  \ attend to commemorate one of the wayangs' great historical events in the shadow\
  \ of an extinct volcano. My inner anthropologist is excited that we at last release\
  \ this delightful Tier 1-5 adventure, which features several inspired wayang illustrations\
  \ by Hannah Boving.</p> \n     <p>February also sees the third installment in the\
  \ ongoing Gloomspires exploration (see <a href=\"/products/btpy9986?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-6-06-Hall-of-the-Flesh-Eaters\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #6-06: Hall of the Flesh Eaters</em></a> and <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy9k92?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-7-19-Labyrinth-of-Hungry-Ghosts\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #7-19: Labyrinth of Hungry Ghosts</em></a> for\
  \ earlier scenarios) by Tom Phillips: <a href=\"/products/btpy9qca?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-815-Hrethnars-Throne\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-15: Hrethnar's Throne</em></a>, a Tier 5-9 adventure.\
  \ This scenario was especially interesting to outline with Tom, as it's this level\
  \ of the site that first caught Mark Moreland's and my eyes during RPG Superstar,\
  \ kicking off this entire series. The PCs return to the Gloomspires with Venture-Captain\
  \ Calisro Benarry, having obtained a reliable means to overcome a lethal barrier\
  \ and explore what lies beyond. Don't think this is a predictable dungeon-crawl,\
  \ though; the Gloomspires is full of surprises and jealous rivals, including one\
  \ of my favorite scenario opening scenes in a long while and this evocative hobgoblin\
  \ pirate illustrated by Sebastian Rodriguez.</p> \n     <p>John Compton<br> <i>Pathfinder\
