  \ class=\"date\">by Steven Savile</p> \n    <h2>Chapter Four: A Burning Love</h2>\
  \ \n    <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n     <p>Caron stumbled as the urdefhan\
  \ threw her into the cage.</p> \n     <p>She went sprawling across the ground as\
  \ the shadow man slammed the cage shut and fired the bolts into place. Pain lanced\
  \ up her thighs as she landed on her knees and pitched forward. </p> \n     <p>A\
  \ voice in the dark. \"Caron?\" </p> \n     <p>It was Caleb. The boy scurried forward\
  \ and threw his arms around her. </p> \n     <p>She wrapped her arms around him\
  \ in turn, pulling back for a moment when he winced at her touch. Beyond the cage,\
  \ a single torch provided enough light to expose the bruising and stains of dried\
  \ blood where he'd been beaten.</p> \n     <p>\"How bad is it?\"</p> \n     <p>\"\
  I'll live,\" the boy said, firelight reflecting from the tears running down his\
  \ cheeks. She wanted to tell him he was safe now, that she wouldn't let anything\
  \ bad happen to him, but she said nothing. There was no point lying to him. </p>\
  \ \n     <p>More urdefhans gathered around the bars, watching them intently.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>She pushed herself up to her feet, standing protectively in front of\
  \ Caleb. \"Let him go,\" she said. \"Let him go and you can have me.\"</p> \n  \
  \   <p><span itemprop=\"description\">One of shadow men moved closer to the cage,\
  \ pressing his face close to the bars. He stood directly in front of her, close\
  \ enough to reach out and touch, his vile organs bright in the dim light, and inclined\
  \ his head to one side. \"I already have you. You have nothing to bargain with.\
  \ Nothing I want that I don't already have.\"</span></p> \n     <p>The laugher was\
  \ accompanied by a strange gurgle as if coming through liquid in the creature's\
  \ throat. He turned his back on them and walked away. The others followed in his\
  \ wake, leaving the two alone again in the dark.</p> \n     <p>Caleb rose slowly\
  \ to stand beside her. He wasn't steady on his feet. </p> \n     <p>Caron turned\
  \ to look into his eyes, only to see the shadow of a ghost.</p> \n     <p>For a\
  \ heartbeat it was as if she faced Neve, the boy's mother, but it was different\
  \ now. Neve was an old ghost. Everyone carried old ghosts. It was how the living\
  \ moved through the world that was important, not the dead who walked with them.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"It's going to be all right,\" she said, running her fingers through\
  \ his hair.</p> \n     <p>\"It's not, is it?\"</p> \n     <p>\"You father's waiting\
  \ for you,\" she said. \"I promised him I'd get you out of here, and I will.\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"But how? How do we get out of here?\"</p> \n     <p>She didn't have\
  \ an answer to that. She hadn't thought that far ahead. \"Our chance will come,\"\
  \ she said, making another promise she didn't know she could keep. \"Can you find\
  \ your way back to the stairwell?\" She couldn't, not without going back through\
  \ the fissure the tunnel rat had led her down, and she had no idea where that fissure\
  \ was because she'd been unconscious when the urdefhans dragged her here.</p> \n\
  \     <p>He nodded.</p> \n     <p>\"Good. You have to be ready. No matter happens.\
  \ When I tell you to run, you run. Promise me. You run and you don't stop running\
  \ until you're at the top of the stairs.\" The boy nodded, rubbing away his tears.\
  \ \"Be strong, son.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Yes, mother.\"</p> \n     <p>It was the first\
  \ time he'd called her that.</p> \n     <p>She couldn't let it get to her, even\
  \ though she felt a surge of love for the boy. They both needed to be strong. The\
  \ darkness weighed heavy on them. There was no easy way of knowing how long they\
  \ would be alone down here. She could only pray that Keir wouldn't get it into his\
  \ head to come and save them. She needed to know he was up there, ready to help\
  \ them get out of this hell if she could work the opportunity to escape. </p> \n\
  \     <p>But that time in the darkness gave her time to think. </p> \n     <p>She\
  \ needed a plan, which meant trying to think through her moves, and think how the\
  \ shadow men would react to them. This was their element. Down here they were kings.\
  \ For all of her skills, for all that she had dedicated her life to the land, to\
  \ nurturing it, this, down here, this was a different kind of evil. It existed purely\
  \ to cause pain. </p> \n     <p>In the distance, hammers and the grating of stone\
  \ haunted them as work continued endlessly on the urdefhan outpost.</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ cage would have to open soon. They'd want Caleb to work. Would they use her, too?\
  \ Would she get a chance to fight their overseer and buy Caleb a few precious seconds\
  \ to run for the stairs? Or would they keep her imprisoned while they worked him\
  \ into the ground, knowing what she was from the sigil of Erastil on her travel-worn\
  \ cloak? </p> \n     <p>She unclasped her cloak and bundled it in the corner of\
  \ the cell, as though making a pillow to rest her head. </p> \n     <p>Her one hope\
  \ came from the possibility of the urdefhans underestimating her. If they saw her\
  \ as some helpless human, not the warrior she was, then maybe, just maybe, she'd\
  \ be able to do something. </p> \n     <p>She thought about huddling at the back\
  \ of the cage, forcing them to come in and get the boy. It was an option, but not\
  \ much of one. Since she had no weapons, she needed to turn the environment into\
  \ her weapon, and that meant using the cage somehow. It was the only thing she had.\
  \ Of course, she was her own best weapon.</p> \n     <p>So she waited, leaning against\
  \ the bars rather than pacing the confines of the cell. She didn't want them to\
  \ know she was a bundle of pent-up energy. Let them think she was beaten.</p> \n\
  \     <p>The sounds of work continued. She heard screams and what could only be\
  \ the feeding frenzy that followed a fallen worker. </p> \n     <p>Then they came\
  \ for the boy.</p> \n     <p>\"You. Come here,\" one of them barked, pointing at\
  \ Caleb while the other opened the lock to release him. Caron pushed herself to\
  \ her feet and put herself between them and Caleb, ready for the moment the door\
  \ swung open. He started to move toward the open door. She held out an arm to stop\
  \ him. \"I'll work,\" she said. \"I'm stronger than I look. Let him go. I'll carry\
  \ his load as well as mine. Just let the boy go.\" She kept on talking. What she\
  \ said wasn't important, it was purely meant to keep their eyes on her. </p> \n\
  \     <p>\"Quiet, human, your turn will come. Give us the boy.\"</p> \n     <p>She\
  \ stepped aside, seemingly in surrender. The side step took her just out of line\
  \ with the open door. It was a single step, but it might just save Caleb's life—\
  if the gods were on his side.</p> \n     <p>With their eyes on him, Caron kicked\
  \ out hard—not at the urdefhan, but at the door, sending it swinging into the shadow\
  \ man's face. Metal jarred against bone on both sides of the iron door. The creature\
  \ staggered backward, momentarily dazed. </p> \n     <p>Its sword clattered to the\
  \ floor. The door swung open on rusted hinges.</p> \n     <p>This was it. </p> \n\
  \     <p>One chance. </p> \n     <p>Ignoring the pain lancing up her leading leg,\
  \ Caron threw herself out of the cage, rolling fast and snatching up the two-bladed\
  \ weapon as she rose. It took all her strength to lift the sword. She screamed as\
  \ she swung, all of her weight behind the blow. The blade's keen edge sliced into\
  \ her captor, opening it up before it could raise its own blade to fend her off.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>It fell to the ground spilling its lifeblood into a dark pool that\
  \ quickly surrounded its body.</p> \n     <p>\"Run!\" she rasped, knowing that her\
  \ scream must have alerted others of their kind. The echo of running feet confirmed\
  \ her fear. </p> \n     <p>She despatched the stunned urdefhan with its own sword.\
  \ There was nothing merciful about the action; she couldn't leave an enemy at her\
  \ back. The scent of blood would only bring on the frenzy, though, drawing them\
  \ like piranhas. </p> \n     <p>They had to get out of there. </p> \n     <div class=\"\

  ></a>\n      <br> An urdefhan wants nothing but war and death.\n     </div> \n \
  \    <p>Caleb was already twenty feet ahead of her, running hard, arms and legs\
  \ pumping in a terrified sprint. She ran after him—as fast as the heavy blade would\
  \ allow. She couldn't hope to catch him, not carrying the sword, but without it\
  \ she wasn't getting out of here. That was the grim reality of it. He was thirty\
  \ feet ahead now, and gaining ground every second they ran. She thought seriously\
  \ about casting the blade aside and just running, but she knew that she'd never\
  \ make it.</p> \n     <p>It was an illusion; a lie of the acoustics. The shadow\
  \ men circled around them, herding them toward death. Without the weapon, she'd\
  \ be helpless to make good on her promise to Keir. With it, she had a chance. A\
  \ small chance, but a chance nonetheless. She'd get the boy to the stairs, and then\
  \ just pray Erastil was with her for one last time, deep in the darkness of this\
  \ damned place.</p> \n     <p>She pushed herself on. She couldn't slow down, even\
  \ as her lungs burned and the bitter acrid air of this hellish place clawed at the\
  \ back of her throat. She ran. And she prayed.</p> \n     <p>Caleb ran close to\
  \ the scaffolding constructed along the outer walls of the subterranean outpost.\
  \ Up above, Caron saw slaves watching him run. They were lit by oil burners along\
  \ the wooden platforms. The flames didn't so much as flicker and the slaves didn't\
  \ whoop or cheer. The whole thing was eerily quiet. They'd seen others make a run\
  \ for it, only to be herded like cattle by the urdefhans and then set upon. Every\
  \ time it happened it only served to drive home the fact that no one got out of\
  \ this hellish place alive. </p> \n     <p>Theirs weren't the only eyes watching\
  \ them run. </p> \n     <p>She saw the organs of the urdefhans radiating rich spots\
  \ of color in the dark, like malevolent fireflies swarming around them.</p> \n \
  \    <p>Caleb was fifty feet ahead now, dangerously alone should the shadow men\
  \ attack. </p> \n     <p>They were creatures of the dark; they didn't need the oil\
  \ fires. They lived their entire lives down here, hence the pigmentless nature of\
  \ their skin. They didn't see light and shade like she did. He mind raced. Did they\
  \ see by heat? She didn't know, but it was possible, wasn't it? And if that was\
  \ the case, fire could effectively blind them if it was fierce enough.</p> \n  \
  \   <p>If she could reach the bottom of the stairwell they had a chance.</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"Run!\" she screamed at the top of her lungs, not to urge Caleb on—the\
  \ boy was flying—but to draw the shadow dwellers to her.</p> \n     <p>And then\
  \ the first voice cried out from above.</p> \n     <p>One of the slaves urging her\
  \ boy to run for his life. </p> \n     <p>The cry was taken up by a second slave.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Then a third.</p> \n     <p>In a few seconds the entire subterranean\
  \ cavern echoed with that one word called out by first one voice, then a dozen and\
  \ yet a dozen more, until it swelled into a baying chorus that brought the urdefhans\
  \ out to silence it.</p> \n     <p>And then it hit her: down here chaos could be\
  \ her fiercest ally. </p> \n     <p>Without thinking, she veered away from Caleb's\
  \ disappearing light and ran, head down, toward the scaffolds, venting a wild cry\
  \ as she hefted the double-bladed sword and unleashed a wild swing straight for\
  \ one of the thick stanchions holding the precarious structure up. She knew even\
  \ as she did that some of the slaves would be hurt by the collapse—but others could\
  \ run. And catching one boy in a crowd of frightened, panicked, and desperate slaves\
  \ running for their lives would be so much more difficult. </p> \n     <p>With the\
  \ oil burners toppled, the fire would spread quickly to the wood, consuming it with\
  \ bright blinding light. </p> \n     <p>The collapse was fast as it was brutal.\
  \ And deafening.</p> \n     <p>Caleb faltered, looking back over his shoulder.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Caron urged him on. They had seconds, not minutes.</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ sounds of pursuit came from every direction. Flames moved in the dark space that\
  \ was the distance. She saw children streaming down from the collapsed platform,\
  \ bleeding and battered, hobbling toward the lights, each trying to help the other\
  \ in a bid for freedom. They wouldn't get far, but it was better to die trying to\
  \ taste freedom than it was to work slavishly to death only to become meat for the\
  \ beasts. She couldn't save them all, and she couldn't wait for them to climb the\
  \ stairs; she could only focus on Caleb. If any of them got out, then Erastil be\
  \ praised, it would be nothing short of a miracle.</p> \n     <p>She saw her boy\
  \ standing at the bottom rope of the wooden stairway that led out of the pit, ever\
  \ upward finally to the sun.</p> \n     <p>And to Keir.</p> \n     <p>\"Up!\" she\
  \ yelled as he hesitated.</p> \n     <p>Behind her came the sounds of dying.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The boy was rooted to the spot, staring at the chaos behind her. </p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Your father's waiting. Tell him I love him. I love you. Now go!\"\
  </p> \n     <p>He snapped out of it and threw his torch on the ground to light her\
  \ way, and started to climb. </p> \n     <p>She glanced over her shoulder. </p>\
  \ \n     <p>Half a dozen rag-clothed children ran toward the light. Behind them\
  \ came countless urdefhans, their vile faces twisted by the firelight. She couldn't\
  \ wait for the children. But she couldn't damn them, either. She froze, great sword\
  \ in hand, knowing she couldn't take the first step up toward freedom while they\
  \ were so close and yet so far away. Her fate was sealed; she was going to die down\
  \ here. That was the deal she offered the universe. One moment of divine intervention—\
  these lives saved, her life traded.</p> \n     <p>And it would buy time for her\
  \ son to flee.</p> \n     <p>No matter what she'd thought no more than a day ago,\
  \ he was her son in every way that mattered. Family was about more than blood.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Faster,\" she screamed at the children. \"Run!\" </p> \n     <p>She\
  \ looked up to where Caleb was, near the first platform. He still had so far to\
  \ go. He looked back down at her. She snatched up the torch he'd thrown down, and\
  \ raised it above her head. Its flame burst into life as she swung it through the\
  \ air. </p> \n     <p>He knew what she was about to do. She could see it in his\
  \ face. She didn't want to look at him anymore. Now it was all about dying.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Queen sacrifice. It felt like forever since Keir had shown the boy the\
  \ move.</p> \n     <p>She turned to face the oncoming blackness, holding out the\
  \ burning brand in one hand, the urdefhan blade in the other, with just one single\
  \ thought: keep the enemy at bay. Every moment could be precious, every heartbeat\
  \ increasing the chance for Caleb to climb further out of their reach.</p> \n  \
  \   <p>The first of the rag-clothed children reached her. She urged the girl up\
  \ the stairs. Then the second and the third. But time was running out. The urdefhans\
  \ were almost on them. The fourth and fifth made it to her together, but the sixth—\
  a young boy clinging onto some childhood toy he couldn't bear to be parted with—\
  was brought down by the first on the savage shadow dwellers. She should have let\
  \ the child die, but she couldn't. She hurled herself at the creature, thrusting\
  \ the flame in its face to drive it away from the boy, then dropped the blade to\
  \ scoop the frail child up, and sweeping the burning brand through the air stepped\
  \ back and back to the stairs. \"Run for your life, little one,\" she whispered.\
  \ Tears streaked down her face. One life for seven. That was a good thing. She couldn't\
  \ think about the children who hadn't made it to the stairs. </p> \n     <p>The\
  \ urdefhans gathered around her, coming close to the flame. The nearest released\
  \ a gurgling cry that revealed its fear of the fire. But the torch wouldn't burn\
  \ forever.</p> \n     <p>She dared not turn her back on them. When the flame died,\
  \ so would she. </p> \n     <p>The last of the children was only twenty feet above\
  \ her. \"Keep going!\" She yelled at them. There was one last weapon she could use,\
  \ she realized. \"Spill the oil from the burners!\"</p> \n     <p>She had no way\
  \ of knowing if they'd heard her, but a glance up into the shaft confirmed that\
  \ they were climbing, Caleb lost to sight now as the slowly turning spiral promised\
  \ to take him to his father. </p> \n     <p>The horde grew braver as the torch burned\
  \ lower, looking to surround her. Caron defended the ladder with nothing more than\
  \ the dying torch. They knew she was not going anywhere. They knew that it was only\
  \ a matter of time. And they were faster than the children. It was useless to fight\
  \ them. This was their world.</p> \n     <p>Caron felt a single drop of oil fall\
  \ on her face. They'd heard her. </p> \n     <p>She retreated onto the first wooden\
  \ step and with her empty hand reached out for the first oil burner, the only one\
  \ the children had missed. She upended it, the oil splashing over her arm and down\
  \ her left side. </p> \n     <p>The urdefhans came on, crowding the stairs, braving\
  \ the flame. </p> \n     <p>Caron swept the torch through the air, causing it to\
  \ ripple with the oil fumes.</p> \n     <p>She had to hope it was enough.</p> \n\
  \     <p>She had to believe the boy would make it all the way to the top. </p> \n\
  \     <p>She swung again and again, pushing them back until she felt more oil spilling\
  \ from above. It wasn't a steady flow. She prayed it would be enough and touched\
  \ the torch to the rope. A gout of flame rose from it and raced up the twisted threads.\
  \ She dropped the torch to the floor. The wooden treads began to smoulder. It would\
  \ be enough. It had to be.</p> \n     <p>\"Remember, I love you, son!\" she shouted\
  \ again, not knowing if her voice would carry out of the pit, but needing the boy\
  \ to know. They wouldn't catch him now. That was all she'd wanted. She'd kept her\
  \ promise. It had taken everything she had, every ounce of strength was gone. </p>\
  \ \n     <p>As though in answer, the flame caught her oil-soaked foot and leg, chasing\
  \ up her body as she blocked the way to the children, burning bright, and carried\
  \ on chasing after them up the stairs. The urdefhans howled their frustration.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>There was no way past the burning woman.</p> \n     <p>Coming Next Week:\
