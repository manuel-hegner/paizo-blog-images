  \   <p class=\"date\">by Christopher Paul Carey</p> \n   <h2>Chapter One: The Storm</h2>\
  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">Searing\
  \ heat and abrasive, sand-laden winds burned the exposed patches of skin around\
  \ Jasilia's stylized brass goggles. She slipped a hand beneath her tightly drawn\
  \ burnoose and adjusted the scarf around raw cheeks, her other hand thrust up under\
  \ the half-buried opening of the tomb's great stone lip so the wailing winds wouldn't\
  \ sweep her away.</span></p> \n    <p>Beside her, what looked like an oversized\
  \ scarab in human form gestured frantically at her to get below. Nekhtep the Constant,\
  \ the Risen Guard assigned to protect her, lived up to both his duty and his honorary\
  \ title, but the sight of him tore at her more fiercely than the khamsin's fury.\
  \ She looked away, watching streaks of blue-tinged flame soar up over the desert\
  \ and scorch the charcoal sky.</p> \n    <p>The ages-old struggle between the elemental\
  \ chieftains would go on forever, it seemed. But then, wasn't that built into their\
  \ natures? Fire consumed air and air fed fire—not unlike her and Nekhtep, each forever\
  \ seared by the other's presence. Like the elemental forces of nature, there was\
  \ no arguing it. After their indiscretions came to light, Nekhtep had chosen to\
  \ end their relationship and die under the pharaoh's blade. <i>A fortunate development,</i>\
  \ the Ruby Prince had remarked. <i>Better than my sister disgracing herself by marrying\
  \ a commoner.</i></p> \n    <p>The screaming sands drowned out her curse. It was\
  \ just as well. She would rather Nekhtep not hear it.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\"\

  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n     <br>A Risen Guard gives his life for the Pharaoh—and that's\
  \ just the beginning\n    </div> \n    <p>Jasilia turned from the storm and descended\
  \ into the tomb. A few moments later, a heavy scraping of stone on stone grated\
  \ above. The silence that followed was filled only by the ringing in her ears and\
  \ the coughing fit that seized Nekhtep as dust and sand settled in the enclosed\
  \ space. She knelt on the narrow ramp, removed a foot-long rod from her bag, and\
  \ struck it against the rough stone at her feet. The tip blossomed with silvery\
  \ light.</p> \n    <p>The glow revealed a steep, limestone-walled corridor barely\
  \ wider than her shoulders, its ceiling crawling with hieroglyphs from a forgotten\
  \ age. Keeping her weight on her heels, she shuffled downward while Nekhtep's half-plate\
  \ scarab armor clanked and clattered behind her. After they had proceeded what Jasilia\
  \ judged to be about thirty feet below the surface, the floor leveled. A pile of\
  \ rubble strewn beneath a dark, yawning hole in the far wall marked the corridor's\
  \ end.</p> \n    <p>\"We'll be down here a while.\" She placed a boot heel on the\
  \ uneven rocks to judge their stability. \"Might as well make our stay useful.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Let me go first, O Heritor.\" Nekhtep tried to sidle past Jasilia\
  \ in the narrow corridor, but she held out an arm to block him.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Not a chance. You know I always go first. Royal privilege.\"</p> \n    <p>\"But\
  \ the tomb may still be guarded—\"</p> \n    <p>\"You did read the inscriptions\
  \ on the way down?\"</p> \n    <p>Nekhtep looked sheepish beneath his beetle-headed\
  \ helmet.</p> \n    <p>\"Oh. Right. We really do need to get you back to school,\
  \ Nekhtep. The glyphs indicate interment of one Sebti Heptna. Minor nobility. Probably\
  \ could barely afford to construct the tomb, let alone an eternal protector.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>She almost felt bad for needling him. After all, the glyphs were an unusual\
  \ regional variant, and she could read only about a quarter of them herself. Besides,\
  \ Nekhtep was doubtless more proficient in the ancient tongues of the region than\
  \ most of the foreign \"scholars\" her older brother had crawling all over the country.\
  \ But she couldn't help herself. Anything to get through that Risen Guard stoicism.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Nekhtep relented and stepped back, but he drew his khopesh from its wide\
  \ leather scabbard.</p> \n    <p>She rolled her eyes, then climbed over the rubble\
  \ into the darkness.</p> \n    <p>The passage led her through five feet of solid,\
  \ jagged-edged rock before opening onto a shallow ledge running along the perimeter\
  \ of a small chamber. Above the ledge, depictions of humanoid figures painted in\
  \ burgundy and turquoise danced across high limestone walls in sunk relief. Funerary\
  \ ceramics lay overturned and broken along the room's far side. A large chunk of\
  \ the east wall showed only bare, uneven rock where the smooth stone had been chiseled\
  \ out, presumably so the vandals could abscond with some treasure embedded in the\
  \ stone.</p> \n    <p>Two sarcophagi—a massive one that doubtless once held Sebti\
  \ Heptna's remains and another that appeared to be sized for a human infant or small\
  \ child—lay in the chamber's center. The limestone covering of the smaller sarcophagus\
  \ still lay in place and seemingly undamaged. The heavy stone lid of the larger\
  \ sarcophagus was cracked and lay toppled to one side, and from her position on\
  \ the ledge Jasilia could see that the inner coffin was missing.</p> \n    <p>But\
  \ thank Abadar, the thieves had left behind the greatest treasure of all: a small,\
  \ unassuming row of hieroglyphs cut into a plain limestone ribbon circling the chamber's\
  \ uppermost reaches. Now if only she knew enough of the regional dialect to make\
  \ sense of the glyphs.</p> \n    <p>Jasilia tossed her glowing rod to the basalt\
  \ floor and hopped down to retrieve it.</p> \n    <p>\"Come on in!\"</p> \n    <p>She\
  \ turned to find Nekhtep already emerging from the tunnel onto the ledge above her.\
  \ The Risen Guard removed his helmet and proceeded to doff his armor. She snuck\
  \ a look at the muscular form that emerged from the half-plate, though she winced\
  \ when she saw the burns the khamsin sands had seared on that handsome face. Earlier\
  \ on their journey she had teased him for carrying along the heavy, suffocating\
  \ armor. Now she saw that it had saved his life. She would never forgive herself\
  \ if she got him killed.</p> \n    <p>Again.</p> \n    <p>A sick feeling crept into\
  \ Jasilia's stomach. \"You're sure Ojan made it to the eastern tomb?\"</p> \n  \
  \  <p>Nekhtep nodded down to her. \"He signaled to me that he'd be fine, and to\
  \ get you below. Then he led the camels down with him. I waited long enough to see\
  \ that he'd sealed himself up.\"</p> \n    <p>She sighed with relief. \"Then there's\
  \ nothing we can do but wait out the storm.\"</p> \n    <p>While Nekhtep extricated\
  \ himself from his armor, Jasilia walked to the south wall, removed a decorative\
  \ torch from an ancient stone sconce jutting from the ledge, and affixed her glowing\
  \ rod in its place. She took a field-book and stylus from her bag and knelt down,\
  \ craning her neck as she began to transcribe the glyphs from the limestone ribbon\
  \ above. She heard Nekhtep jump down into the chamber, trying her best to ignore\
  \ him as he made a circuit of the tomb, presumably to verify with his own senses\
  \ that nothing in the chamber presented a threat to his royal charge.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>\"Early Second Age?\" Nekhtep asked.</p> \n    <p>Out of the corner of her\
  \ eye, Jasilia could see him examining the glyphs on the child-sized sarcophagus's\
  \ stone casing.</p> \n    <p>\"No,\" she said. \"Khamos's tip was wrong this time.\
  \ The tomb is Late Apsu, or maybe Middle Osezis Period. See the Pahmet influence\
  \ in the murals? Definitely not as early as Khamos claimed. But that's what I get\
  \ for trusting a ghoul.\"</p> \n    <p>Stone grated, followed by a loud thunk. She\
  \ looked up to see Nekhtep dusting himself off, the covering of the smaller sarcophagus\
  \ lying off-kilter. Jasilia cursed. \"At least watch that you don't damage the inscription.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Now Nekhtep was leaning into the sarcophagus and probing its bottom\
  \ with the point of his khopesh. Jasilia tried to concentrate on transcribing the\
  \ glyphs, translating what she could as she sketched the archaic symbols. She felt\
  \ she was on the verge of deciphering the meaning of a particularly troublesome\
  \ glyph when an eruption of Nekhtep's clattering blade caused her to break the tip\
  \ of her stylus.</p> \n    <p>\"Stop it!\" she snapped. \"You're worse than a Pathfinder,\
  \ compromising the site like that!\"</p> \n    <p>The scraping of Nekhtep's khopesh\
  \ ceased, but she could still hear him rustling about in the well of the sarcophagus.\
  \ Jasilia threw her notebook and stylus to the dusty floor and stood, whirling to\
  \ confront him.</p> \n    <p>\"If you don't cut it out, I'll—\"</p> \n    <p>An\
  \ unearthly yowl filled the chamber. Nekhtep raised his arm out of the sarcophagus,\
  \ and a small feline head—skull-like and with eyes that glowed red in the torchlight—\
  emerged with it, the creature's sharp teeth clamped onto the man's leather armband.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Jasilia shook off a shiver fear and, drawing her short sword, ran toward\
  \ Nekhtep. The man didn't wait for her, however, and his khopesh made short work\
  \ of the ubashki. He held the undead cat aloft by a loose wrapping, coolly examining\
  \ the creature as it spun slowly before him.</p> \n    <p>\"Too poor for a guardian?\"\
  \ Nekhtep mused. \"I guess the poor make due.\" He dropped the ubashki back into\
  \ the coffin and rubbed his hands together as if trying to flick off the creature's\
  \ filth.</p> \n    <p>\"You call <i>that</i> a guardian?\" Jasilia slid her sword\
  \ back into its leather sheath. \"When it's my time to kick off, I'll find myself\
  \ a proper protector to have strangled and stand vigil over my tomb, not a harmless\
  \ little housecat.\" She looked Nekhtep up and down, as if appraising his value.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Nekhtep's expression was as still as the limestone walls. \"Dying once\
  \ for you wasn't enough?\"</p> \n    <p>Jasilia heard her own breath catch in the\
  \ silence of the tomb.</p> \n    <p>She straightened and walked across the chamber\
  \ with feigned aplomb. \"In any case,\" she continued, picking up her field-book\
  \ from the dusty floor and tracing over a glyph with the half-broken tip of her\
  \ stylus, \"at least the looters who came before us were smart enough not to disturb\
  \ that sarcophagus. Now can you stay put and let me get back to my transcription?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>It was dark enough in the tomb that she might have imagined Nekhtep's\
  \ smirk.</p> \n    <p align=\"Center\">∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n    <p>When they estimated that\
  \ morning had come, Nekhtep heaved aside the great stone slab that sealed the tomb.\
  \ After unburying themselves from the deluge of sand that fell down into the passage,\
  \ Jasilia and Nekhtep emerged into a world that looked very different from that\
  \ of the day before. Morning's golden rays skimmed through small valleys of sand,\
  \ dappling the seemingly unending field of dunes that had risen up overnight. That\
  \ the barren plains of the Glazen Sheets lay a mere few days' journey to the east\
  \ only made the sudden appearance of the great sand mountains that much more astonishing.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Jasilia looked about the site, her anxiety mounting. Where was the entrance\
  \ to the other tomb in which Ojan had sealed himself to escape the khamsin's wrath?\
  \ She tried to orient herself by the sun's position in relation to the tomb opening\
  \ they had just exited.</p> \n    <p>Her stomach turned. The other tomb had been\
  \ to the southwest, just about where an immense wall of sand now rose from the rolling\
  \ scape—a mound so high she and Nekhtep could never hope to unbury it by themselves.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>She took off across the sands and ran up the dune's convex rise, her\
  \ leg muscles straining as the sand gave way beneath each desperate step. When at\
  \ last she reached the crest of the dune, she looked down its leeward side. Some\
  \ twenty feet below, an arcing shadow darkened the bottom of the slipface, but not\
  \ enough that she couldn't see the black opening at the base and a rectangular block\
  \ of limestone cast aside next to the hole. A whitish trail, perhaps a vein of salt\
  \ unearthed by the storm, ran from the edge of the hole and snaked eastward, disappearing\
  \ into a valley of sand. A few yards from the opening lay the bloody corpses of\
  \ two of her party's three camels.</p> \n    <p>A moment later, Nekhtep was beside\
  \ her, looking down over the dune's crest. Then they were both heeling their way\
  \ down the slipface into the dune's cool shadow, sand sloughing from the great mound\
  \ with each footfall. </p> \n    <p>When they reached the base, Jasilia entered\
  \ the hole and scampered down the tomb's steep entryway, the scuffing tread of Nekhtep's\
  \ boots following close behind. As the dim light from the surface fell away, she\
  \ removed another rod from her bag and struck it on the floor, bathing the narrow\
  \ corridor in an ashen glow.</p> \n    <p>The passage opened onto a tomb much plainer\
  \ in design than the one in which she and Nepkhtep had spent the night. Bare stone\
  \ walls enclosed the small chamber, in the center of which lay an open sarcophagus,\
  \ doubtless plundered of its meager treasures in some lost age. Three dromedary\
  \ saddles sat stacked against one wall alongside Ojan's supply pack. </p> \n   \
  \ <p>But the tomb's architecture and her party's equipment weren't what grabbed\
  \ Jasilia's attention. No, it was the stink of undeath that assaulted the confining\
  \ chamber, and the two humanoid forms that lay unmoving before the sarcophagus.\
  \ One had been decapitated, by the swing of a khopesh if she judged correctly. The\
  \ other had been cleaved nearly in two at the waist.</p> \n    <p>She knelt to examine\
  \ the severed head and wrinkled her nose.</p> \n    <p>\"The flesh is still rotting,\"\
  \ she said.</p> \n    <p>Nekhtep began examining the chamber and disappeared behind\
  \ the sarcophagus. When he rose, he held a finely crafted khopesh in his hand.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Ojan's,\" Jasilia breathed.</p> \n    <p>She stood, feeling the blood\
  \ draining from her face. \"No. It can't be that.\"</p> \n    <p>\"What?\" Nekhtep\
  \ said. \"Can't be what?\"</p> \n    <p>But Jasilia was already bolting back up\
  \ the passageway on her way to the surface. When she emerged, she fell to her knees\
  \ beside the whitish trail leading from the mouth of the tomb and scooped some of\
  \ the substance into her hand. Instead of the dry grit of salt or some other mineral,\
  \ she felt only cold.</p> \n    <p>Nekhtep came up out of the tomb entrance and\
  \ stood over her.</p> \n    <p>\"What is it?\"</p> \n    <p>Jasilia rose and sieved\
  \ the mix of melting frost and sand through her fingers and onto Nekhtep's open\
  \ palm.</p> \n    <p>\"I know where they've taken Ojan.\"</p> \n    <p align=\"\
