  \ Azlant</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, October 17, 2017</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"\
  articleBody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Subscribers have already started\
  \ thumbing through their copies of the third installment of the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/ruinsOfAzlant\"\
  >Ruins of Azlant Adventure Path</a> as they arrived in the mail, and one of the\
  \ first things I saw people talking about was the article on the gods of ancient\
  \ Azlant. I'll talk a little more about that in a bit, but for now here's a look\
  \ at some of the other exciting things in <a href=\"/products/btpy9uk2?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-123-The-Flooded-Cathedral\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #123: The Flooded Cathedral</em></a>.</p> \n    <p>Up\
  \ until this point in the Adventure Path, the PCs have had to deal with only a few\
  \ encounter locations that are submerged, but this one takes the water wings off\
  \ and drops the adventurers into the deep end in—you guessed it—a flooded cathedral.\
  \ Don't get scared off yet! The entire cathedral isn't flooded, and not all of the\
  \ adventure takes place in that one location. This adventure reveals some of the\
  \ secrets of Azlant as the heroes explore a temple of Amaznen on an island near\
  \ Ancorato. While inside they get to see some of the amazing wonders engineered\
  \ by that dead god's priesthood like clockwork winding stations, seismic power generators,\
  \ intelligent clockworks, and an analytical engine.</p> \n    <p>This volume also\
  \ contains an article about clockworks, which talks about their origin and places\
  \ they are more common on Golarion. It also includes a number of new augmentations\
  \ for clockwork creatures to keep them fresh in your games, including ioun memory\
  \ nodes, which grant clockwork creatures a measure of sentience.</p> \n    <div\

  \    <p>I also got the chance to explore religion in ancient Azlant with a full\
  \ pantheon of gods commonly worshiped during the height of the empire. With the\
  \ utter destruction of Azlant, it's a wonder that any knowledge of these gods carried\
  \ through to the current age. That many did is a testament to faith. Some of these\
  \ gods are familiar faces that were worshiped slightly differently over 10,000 years\
  \ ago, while others deities in the article are new and mostly unknown to the Inner\
  \ Sea and current day Golarion. In this article you can learn about how Shelyn was\
  \ depicted as being in mourning after her brother left for places unknown, and how\
  \ Pharasmins during the height of Azlant still trusted in prophesy.</p> \n    <p>Some\
  \ people who've already read this article have commented that the details on Nurgal\
  \ don't exactly add up to what's mentioned in <a href=\"/products/btpy9tok?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Book-of-the-Damned\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder RPG Book of the Damned</em></a>. Much of this is due to the focus\
  \ of the pantheon article, where I was focusing on how things were close to the\
  \ end of the Azlanti Empire. The ancient origin of Nurgal as presented in <em>Book\
  \ of the Damned</em> happened long before the empire's collapse, and frankly an\
  \ expansive origin story for that demon lord deserves to be in the <em>Book of the\
  \ Damned</em> where it has more space than a single column in an Adventure Path.</p>\
