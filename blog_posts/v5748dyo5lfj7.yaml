  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">In\
  \ the \"Woe is Me\" department, I'm being paid to play Pathfinder all day today\
  \ for generous donors to the <a href=\"https://goblinworks.com/\">Pathfinder Online</a>\
  \ Kickstarter effort from last year, so I've got precious little time for this blog\
  \ today. There are characters to kill, after all, and we can't keep Pharasma waiting\
  \ too long for their tortured souls.</span></p> \n    <p>With that in mind, I want\
  \ to take a quick hop, skip, and jump around January's 55-figure <a href=\"/products/btpy91pu\"\
  >Wrath of the Righteous</a> set of <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids\"\
  >Pathfinder Battles</a> prepainted plastic gaming figures to highlight a few minis\
  \ that I really like from the set. </p> \n    <p>Without much further ado, here\
  \ they are!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71408_Mongrel_500.jpeg\"\
  > <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71408_Mongrel_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Here we have the multi-faceted Mongrel, a combination\
  \ creature made up from the parts of several different creatures. Every Mongrel\
  \ looks unique and different, but this one looks exactly like the one statted up\
  \ on page 191 of the <a href=\"/products/btpy8hif\">Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2</a>.\
  \ This is an amazingly detailed sculpt for a common, and I find a new cool detail\
  \ every time I look at it. From the segmented insect eye to the giant claw, this\
  \ guy is a winner. Or, rather, he's probably a huge loser, but his figure sure looks\
  \ cool. The Mongrel is a Medium, common figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  > <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71408_Berbalang_500.jpeg\"><img\
  \ src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71408_Berbalang_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>What's scarier than an undead humanoid? Why, a FLYING\
  \ undead humanoid, of course. Here we have the Berbalang, a classic creature from\
  \ real world mythology and fantasy gaming, straight from page 40 of the <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8odu\">Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3</a>. The Berbalang is a Medium, common\
  \ figure. </p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71408_SuicideDemon_500.jpeg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71408_SuicideDemon_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>We want you to live! Or, at the very least, we want\
  \ you to never turn into this thing. Behold the Suicide Demon, from page 58 of <a\
  \ href=\"products/btpy8hij\">Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Book of the Damned Volume\
  \ 2: Lords of Chaos</a>. Suicide Demons play an important role in the <a href=\"\
  /pathfinder/adventurePath/wrathOfTheRighteous\">Wrath of the Righteous Adventure\
  \ Path</a>. They stand about 7 feet tall, are covered in self-inflicted wounds with\
  \ teeth, and they've got four blood-soaked arms. COOL. The Suicide Demon is a rather\
  \ large Medium figure, slated at the uncommon rarity.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  > <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71408_Jaruunicka_500.jpeg\"><img\
  \ src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71408_Jaruunicka_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Here we have Jaruunicka, a nasty black annis cleric\
  \ of Sifkesh, demon lord of heresy. She's got an amazing design right down to the\
  \ blood-soaked hem of her dress. She doubles easily for any Large hag or hideous\
  \ crone spirit, and I cannot wait to field her against my PCs. Her pose is excellent,\
  \ and the sculpt is impeccable. Jaruunicka appears on page 35 of <a href=\"/products/btpy8yor\"\
  >Pathfinder Adventure Path 75: Demon's Heresy\"</a>. She is a Large, uncommon figure.</p>\

  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71408_Aponavicous_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>We just released a cool <a href=\"/products/btpy92jo\"\
  >Serpent Demon</a> in our most recent set, <a href=\"/products/btpy909j\">Legends\
  \ of Golarion</a>. That figure used an off-beat paint scheme and wielded a bunch\
  \ of colorful weapons, which had a lot of reviewers complaining that we didn't take\
  \ a more traditional approach with that figure. I didn't worry about it, because\
  \ I knew this figure would follow right on its heels. Here we have Aponavicius,\
  \ the serpent demon general of the demon lord Deskari's Worldwound host. She stands\
  \ considerably taller than the Legends of Golarion Serpent Demon, and she's one\
  \ of the most gorgeous figures in this set. The paint scheme is great, as are the\
  \ array of exotic weapons she wields (which took us about 9 tries to get right at\
  \ the factory). I hope you love her as much as we do! Aponavicius is a Large, rare\
  \ figure.</p> \n    <p>And that's it for today's preview. I'm off to go run four\
  \ adventurers through \"The Throne of Azlant,\" the dungeon level I designed for\
  \ the upcoming <i>Emerald Spire</i> superadventure that was generated as a result\
  \ of the <a href=\"https://goblinworks.com/\">Pathfinder Online</a> Kickstarter.\
  \ Wish me luck!</p> \n    <p>Better yet, wish THEM luck!</p> \n    <p>See you next\
  \ week for more exciting <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids\">Pathfinder\
  \ Battles</a> previews!</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p> \n   </div>\
