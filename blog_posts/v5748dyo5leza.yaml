  description\"><p>From pesky quasits to fiendishly handsome incubi, grotesque dretches\
  \ to cunning glabrezu, all of the foulest denizens of the Abyss continually show\
  \ that they are in dire need of slaying. To this end, countless groups and organizations\
  \ across the Inner Sea train in the art of hunting, defeating, and slaying demons\
  \ that crawl forth onto the Material Plane. Alternatively, these daring adventurers\
  \ delve into the heart of the Abyss itself, taking the battle to the demons' home\
  \ plane while performing harrowing missions to retrieve valuable treasures or rescue\
  \ captured victims. Both of these themes are the focus of <a href=\"/products/btpy8ywa\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Player Companion: Demon Hunter's Handbook</i></a>—a volume no demon-slaying\
  \ adventurer should miss!</p></span> \n    <p>In addition to all the usual goodies\
  \ readers have come to expect from Player Companions (including new magic items,\
  \ feats, spells, and more), one of my favorite parts of <i>Demon Hunter's Handbook</i>\
  \ is a section called \"Innovations of the Crusades,\" which details a slew of inventions\
  \ and items used by the demon hunters and Mendevian soldiers fighting in the Worldwound.\
  \ In addition to the holy fountain firework, deity-specific portable altars, and\
  \ new alchemical items useful for slaying fiends from shadow demons to omoxes, the\
  \ following new item can be a crucial aid to intrepid heroes delving head-first\
  \ into demon territory.</p> \n    <br clear=\"all\"> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p\

  \     <p>This barbed, cold iron arrowhead is alchemically treated to inflict additional\
  \ harm while embedded in creatures that are vulnerable to cold iron. For every angel\
  \ quill arrowhead that damages a target with DR/cold iron, the target's damage reduction\
  \ decreases by 1. Up to five angel quill arrowheads can affect a single target at\
  \ any one time, reducing the target's DR/cold iron by up to 5 (additional arrowheads\
  \ have no effect aside from dealing damage as normal). An affected target can pull\
  \ out a number of arrowheads equal to her Dexterity modifier (minimum 1) as a full-round\
  \ action with a successful DC 15 Heal check. Alternatively, the application of any\
  \ magical healing causes all angel quill arrowheads embedded in the creature to\
  \ instantly fall out.</p> \n     <p>Angel quill arrowheads of silver and adamantine\
  \ are also available for the same price, and affect creatures with DR/silver or\
  \ DR/adamantine, respectively. Crafting any type of angel quill arrowhead requires\
  \ a successful DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <br> \n\
  \    <p>In addition to being useful for any party that might run afoul of extraplanar\
  \ baddies, this book is a perfect aid for groups playing the forthcoming <a href=\"\
  /pathfinder/adventurePath/wrathOfTheRighteous\">Wrath of the Righteous Adventure\
  \ Path</a>. Adventurers need wait not much longer for the chance to expand their\
  \ demon-slaying arsenal and bring the fight to the heart of the demonic incursion,\
