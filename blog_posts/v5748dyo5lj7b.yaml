  > \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">In the Pacific Northwest, our weather turned\
  \ and rain now envelopes our Redmond office in a mist. Falling temperatures, transitioning\
  \ leaves, and blustering winds replaced the bright sunshine and warm weather. The\
  \ rough storms of the past weekend left us tossed about and quite a bit of debris\
  \ and detritus blown about, but all are accounted for. For other Pathfinders, the\
  \ inclement weather patterns of the past few months test their resiliency and survival\
  \ skills. While we have heard from Venture-Officers and players on the eastern seaboard\
  \ of the US, they still face difficulties with flooding and power outages. Though\
  \ divided by location and language, we are all one huge family. If possible, where\
  \ possible, consider offering a helping hand or a dry towel.</p> \n     <h2>Upcoming\
  \ Conventions</h2> \n     <p>This Friday, I am off to Book &amp; Board convention\
  \ in Fairlawn, Ohio. Anyone else heading out to conventions? I know of Pathfinder\
  \ Society events occurring at:</p> \n     <ul>\n      <li>What-Kahn 2016 (Loves\
  \ Park, IL)</li> \n      <li>ReaperCon 2016 (Lewisville, TX)</li> \n      <li>Dan's\
  \ Con of the Vale (Milwaukee, WI)</li> \n      <li>FlatCon 2016 (Bloomington, IL)</li>\
  \ \n      <li>Asheville Scarefest (Black Mountain, NC)</li>\n     </ul> \n     <p>If\
  \ you're in the Akron area, consider stopping by to say \"Hi!\"</p> \n     <h2>Adventure\
  \ Card Guild</h2> \n     <p>Besides rain, October brings with it Mummies! While\
  \ some may knock on your door during the Halloween festivities, it is the ones arriving\
  \ by mail or via your Friendly, Local Game Store that I write about. The <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9mbg\"><em>Pathfinder Adventure Card Game Mummy's Mask Base Set</em></a>\
  \ releases tomorrow! I peeked at a copy in the office and am excited to get playing.\
  \ Gorgeous artwork, innovative mechanics, new blessings, and a few surprises brought\
  \ to us by Mike &amp; Co at Lone Shark Games.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb180\"\

  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PZO3049-NordenBalentiir_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n      <br> <i>Illustration by Roberto Pitturru</i>\n     </div> \n     <p>With\
  \ the new base set comes a new Season of <a href=\"pfsacg\">Pathfinder Society Adventure\
  \ Card Guild</a> play. As I mentioned last week, we changed the naming format this\
  \ time around. We don't have many mummies in the Adventure Card Guild season, so\
  \ it seemed a bit of a misnomer. Author Amanda Hamon-Kunz suggested the title Plundered\
  \ Tombs and we thought it the best fit in describing the season. So we exchanged\
  \ the working title \"Season of the Mummy\" for \"Season of Plundered Tombs\".</p>\
  \ \n     <p>As for the tombs themselves, this season involves much more integration\
  \ with the Pathfinder Society and its associated allies and enemies. The Adventure\
  \ Path introduction, written by John Compton, finds you landing in Sothis with instructions\
  \ to report to Venture-Captain Norden Balentiir. As with Pathfinder Society Roleplaying\
  \ Guild scenarios, the Pathfinder Lodges provide a backdrop and the Venture-Captains\
  \ a resource for player interactions in the region. From Sothis, author Mark Seifter\
  \ takes you on a journey in <em>Adventure 1: Serpents in the Deep</em>. Bet you\
  \ cannot guess what organization features as the henchmen and villains!</p> \n \
  \    <p>Subsequent adventure authors include Linda Zayas-Palmer, John Compton, and\
  \ Amanda Hamon-Kunz. They take the story up, down, over and under the northern portion\
  \ of the continent of Garund. While there, characters meet new allies, uncover secrets,\
  \ and engage in general pandemonium. All of their text supports adventure design\
  \ by Keith Richmond of Lone Shark. Other team members include Vic Wertz (editing\
  \ and development) and Sonja Morris (layout and graphic design). My task is project\
  \ coordination!</p> \n     <h3>Season of the Goblin</h3> \n     <p>But before we\
  \ debut Season of Plundered Tombs, we must wrap up Season of the Goblin. The second\
  \ installment in the mini-Season of the Goblin will release tomorrow, Wednesday,\
  \ October 19th! This time, our goblin friends engage in even more mayhem and madness\
  \ trying to determine who is the best goblin of them all!</p> \n     <h3>Upcoming\
  \ Blog</h3> \n     <p>Next week, John introduces us to the newest Pathfinder Society\
  \ Roleplaying Guild adventures—<a href=\"/products/btpy9oij\"><em>#8-06: Reaping\
  \ What We Sow</em></a> and <a href=\"/products/btpy9oik\"><em>#8-07: From the Tome\
  \ of Righteous Repose</em></a>.</p> \n     <p>Here's the first paragraph John wrote\
  \ introducing the Season of Plundered Tombs, to give you a taste and whet your appetite:</p>\
  \ \n     <blockquote>\n      <i>\"Catastrophe struck the world 10,000 years ago,\
  \ and mighty Osirion was one of the first great nations to rise from the ashes.\
  \ For centuries, its pharaohs oversaw a golden age of expansion and innovation while\
  \ crushing rivals such as the Tekritanin League and the golem armies of the Jistka\
  \ Imperium. Eventually, the kingdom began to stagnate, its leaders unable to match\
  \ the splendid accomplishments of their forebears. Following millennia of decline\
  \ and foreign occupation, Osirion is once again autonomous and prospers under the\
  \ Ruby Prince Khemet III.\"</i>\n      <p></p>\n     </blockquote> \n     <p>Until\
  \ next time—Explore, Report, Cooperate!</p> \n     <p>Tonya Woldridge<br> <i>Organized\
  \ Play Coordinator</i></p> \n    </div> \n   </blockquote> <!-- tags: Pathfinder\
