  \ Robots, and Barbarians: An Interview with Tyler Walpole</h1> \n   <p class=\"\
  date\">Wednesday, May 4, 2011</p> \n   <p> A couple of weeks ago we interviewed\
  \ Ed Greenwood, our Guest of Honor at <a href=\"/paizocon\">PaizoCon 2011</a>. This\
  \ time I had the pleasure of interviewing Tyler Walpole, our Artist Guest of Honor\
  \ this year.</p> \n   <p>Tyler is one of those artists who just gets it. I don't\
  \ think he's created a piece I don't love and it's going to be awesome to see him\
  \ at PaizoCon this year. From orcs battling giant monsters single-handedly, to lone\
  \ barbarians taking on giant arachnid robots, Tyler's art is dynamic, detailed,\
  \ and just plain awesome. Tyler's definitely on the list of artists I want to paint\
  \ murals in every room of my future mansion when I win the lottery.</p> \n   <div\
  \ align=\"center\">\n    <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderCampaignSetting/PZO9226-Numeria.jpg\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderCampaignSetting/PZO9226-Numeria_360.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n   </div> \n   <p>And he's an illustrating machine, doing work\
  \ for us (seriously, look how awesome the <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy8ey4\">Master\
  \ of the Fallen Fortress</a> cover is), IDW on the <a href=\"http://www.idwpublishing.com/catalog/series/1451\"\
  \ target=\"nofollow\">D&amp;D comic</a>, <a href=\"http://tylerwalpole.com/index.php?a=blog&amp;p=24\"\
  \ target=\"nofollow\">Hero Games</a>, and a ton of other high-profile companies.\
  \ We're lucky to have him with us at PaizoCon, and if you're coming out, you should\
  \ definitely see if you can buy him enough drinks to get a sketch.</p> \n   <p>And\
  \ now, on with the interview!</p> \n   <p><b>1. A brief bio, where you are from\
  \ and how you started in the industry?</b></p> \n   <p>I am a self-taught illustrator\
  \ who lives in Des Moines, Iowa. I spent several years trying to break into the\
  \ comic book industry as a penciler. That ended up being a bit like pounding my\
  \ head against a brick wall. Lots of offers to do work for free, but no professional\
  \ (i.e., paid) work. In 2000 I decided to forgo my annual trip to Wizard World Chicago,\
  \ and instead created a portfolio of black-and-white interior illustrations and\
  \ went to Gen Con. I talked to every art director I could find on the showroom floor.\
  \ When I got home, I had an offer to do some work for Palladium Books, and that\
  \ worked out pretty well, so I kept pursuing more and more game work (and added\
  \ color into the mix) until I had enough coming in to make the jump to full time.\
  \ I've managed to stay pretty busy ever since.</p> \n   <p><b>2. When did you discover\
  \ your creative talents?</b></p> \n   <p>I've been drawing since I could hold a\
  \ pencil. I spent a lot of time in grade school being told not to draw on my homework...\
  \ now drawing is my homework!</p> \n   <p><b>3. What inspires you?</b></p> \n  \
  \ <p>I take inspiration from everything. Movies, games, books, walks in the park,\
  \ all of it! I have a pretty active mind, and almost anything can germinate in there\
  \ and come out as something useful for my art.</p> \n   <p><b>4. How would you describe\
  \ your style? </b></p> \n   <p>Oh man, I have no idea. John Romita, Jr. once described\
  \ his work as \"Deadline Style\"... its as much as I can get done by the deadline.\
  \ Working in a publishing environment has sort of dictated that I also have a \"\
  Deadline Style.\" One of these days I'm going to spend just as long as I please\
  \ on something. I'll go back to you after that happens. ;) </p> \n   <p><b>5. Do\
  \ you have a favorite story or character?</b></p> \n   <div align=\"right\">\n \
  \   <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderPlayerCompanion/PZO9413-CoverArt.jpg\" target=\"\
  _blank\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderPlayerCompanion/PZO9413-CoverArt_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\" align=\"right\"></a>\n   </div> \n   <p>Let see... I'm pretty satisfied\
  \ with most of the covers I've done, my favorite is probably the <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy8fvz\"\
  >Orcs of Golarion</a>. It's essentially a Conan vs. the Monster illustration...\
  \ only in this case Conan is an Orc, and he's dual-wielding axes. Sarah pretty much\
  \ let me do my own thing on that one, in design terms, and I really enjoyed it.</p>\
  \ \n   <p><b>6. Who are your favorite artists, writers, and/or influences?</b></p>\
  \ \n   <p>Well, here again, it could be just about anybody. Some of my favorites\
  \ include Donato Giancola, Dan Dos Santos, Todd Lockwood, Greg Manchess, Frank Frazetta,\
  \ James Jean, Phil Hale, Mike Mignola, Kevin Nowlan, Adam Hughes, Bill Willingham,\
  \ and Jim Butcher.</p> \n   <p><b>7. How do you juggle freelance work and life?</b></p>\
  \ \n   <p>I skip out on a lot of sleep. No, seriously, I skip out on a lot of sleep.\
  \ I love my job, but I'm married and have two sons. I do my best to make it to every\
  \ family function, school event, and baseball game. But, many nights, once everyone\
  \ is in bed, I sneak back to the studio to make sure I'm on top of my deadlines,\
  \ and squeeze in some time to develop my own projects. </p> \n   <p><b>8. Describe\
  \ yourself in 5 words.</b></p> \n   <p>Living the dream. So grateful!</p> \n   <p><b>9.\
  \ What's the best thing to happen to you recently?</b></p> \n   <p>Besides being\
  \ Artist Guest of Honor at PaizoCon 2011, you mean? I found a publisher for one\
  \ of those projects!</p> \n   <p><b>10. Any advice for aspiring artists?</b></p>\
  \ \n   <p>Practice your art. All. The. Time. Whatever you decide to do, whatever\
  \ voice emerges through your art, or writing or music, honor it, and do it the best\
  \ you can... the business part of it will follow. People are drawn to excellence\
  \ in many forms, so don't try to be like the other guy. And keep at it!</p> \n \
