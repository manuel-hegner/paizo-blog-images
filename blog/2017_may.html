<p>The <a href = "/products/btpy9qy2?Starfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Starfinder-GM-Screen"><em>Starfinder GM Screen</em></a> gives GMs four panels of diagrams, tables, and summaries of the Starfinder RPG's more common rules and systems. From the most encountered DCs for skill checks to a list of combat actions, an abridged descriptions of the game's conditions to a synopsis of starship combat, this GM screen is packed with information!</p>

<p>And let's talk about the art! Just look at this gorgeous tableau illustrated by Ignacio Bazán Lazcano! All of our Starfinder iconics are fighting for their lives, while a massive space battle rages on above them. If that doesn't get you excited about playing, nothing will!</p>

<a href = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/PZO7101-Preview1.jpg"><img src = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/PZO7101-Preview1_500.jpeg"></a></div>

<p>Last year you might remember <a href = "/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5litw?Announcing-the-Starfinder-Roleplaying-Game">we announced something pretty big</a>, and we didn't mess around this time: Starfinder is coming! Space guns blazing, the massive <a href = "/products/btpy9qy1"><em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em></a> was in the spotlight of the preview banquet. Lots of information came at us at lightspeed (and Jason Keeley made a truly amazing and landmark entrance with a provisional copy of the <em>Core Rulebook</em>), and I'm even still processing them all, but here are some key things of note:</p>

<ul><li>All seven iconics and the core races were introduced by Senior Developer Rob McCreary, and you can expect the series of backstories and class introductions on the Paizo blog to resume soon after we wrap up the show.</li>
<li>Each race receives a detailed write up with a plethora of options and ideas for player chracters, with <a href = "https://twitter.com/paizo/status/868675250292051968/photo/1" target = "_blank">pretty gorgeous introductory spreads</a>.</li>
<li>Each class gets a similar treatment in the <em>Core Rulebook</em>, with easy to reference features and statistics to flesh out your own custom build. What I really like about each class writeup are the character theme options in the back of each class section to give you a place to kick off your next character idea. The preview last night featured operative class samples like the hacker, investigator, theif, and trailblazer.</li>
<li>Development Coordinator Amanda Hamon Kunz gave us a look at character creation in Starfinder. This chapter has it all! Whether you're an RPG veteran, or a casual player like me, you will find ways to get your character up and running with an intuitive building process as well as prebuilt options to pick up and go.</li>
<li>Did we mention that yes, you can <i>magic missile</i> in space?</li>
<li>What about a spell to summon a swarm of nano-bots to do your space-magic bidding?! <span class = "tiny"><i>'Cause yeah, we did mention that ;)</i></span></li>
<li>Developer Owen KC Stephens abated concerns about the hanging question regarding goblins. in. space. Yes, they're there, and they've got laser guns.</li>
<li>Did we mention weapons? <a href = "https://twitter.com/paizo/status/868676608755851264/photo/1" target = "_blank">Because this is just one spread of the guns available in Starfinder.</a></li>
<li>Editor Jason Keeley covered some of the information regarding starships. The chapter covering them has rules for engagement, stats for prebuilt ships, and rules for building your own craft.</li>
<li>And what point is there in having a ship to get around without being able to travel to new worlds and get caught in alien traps? The Game Mastering chapter provides resources for your next campaign. Let's just hope your players are resourceful enough to escape certain sticky situations, like, say... escape a certain trash compactor.</li>
<li>To wrap up, Creative Director James L. Sutter gave us all insight into how the system that Golarion previously occupied has evolved since the planet's mysterious disappearance so long ago. <a href = "https://twitter.com/paizo/status/868677952669536256/photo/1" target = "_blank">The chart of the Pact Worlds system</a> includes worlds familiar to you if you've played Pathfinder before, but with notable exceptions, such as the replacement of Golarion with the huge center on Absalom Station and the Idari, making its way around the Pact Worlds' sun. Each planet has a two-page spread devoted to it in the <em>Core Rulebook</em>.</li>
<li>Hellknights in space!</li>
<li><a href = "https://twitter.com/paizo/status/868678659476824066/photo/1" target = "_blank">... the Azlanti Star Empire.</a></li>
<li>A number of familiar gods are still part of Starfinder's pantheon, but there are some new notable additions, such as Nyarlathotep.</li></ul>

<p>A few months after Gen Con, when the <em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em> will officially release, the <a href = "/products/btpy9s2l?Starfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Alien-Archive"><em>Alien Archive</em></a> will provide GMs and players with a number of new aliens and monsters to expand their world. There are aliens that you can play as, enemies to defeat, and the cute cuddly lil guys seen at the bottom of the final cover seen below!</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//static2.paizo.com/image/product/catalog/PZO/PZO7105.jpg"><img src = "//static3.paizo.com/image/product/catalog/PZO/PZO7105_360.jpeg"></a></div>

<p><em>Alien Archive</em> takes a departure from the <em>Bestiary</em> volumes released for the Pathfinder RPG, as it will include options specific to the aliens found within such as equipment, spells, and more. Meaning that there is something for just about everyone within its pages.</p>

<p>After the Starfinder portion, Erik gave us a look at what is ahead for Golarion a few some many years before. The just-announced War for the Crown Adventure Path begins in February 2018! War for the Crown is a Taldor-centric campaign of espionage and intrigue where your heroes decide the fate of the nation. This next Adventure Path is being coordinated by mastermind Developer Crystal Frasier! Stay tuned for more details about this Adventure Path this summer.</p>

<p>So, the PaizoCon Banquet is generally where Erik goes up and mic drops a brand new Pathfinder RPG hardcover, but! We're not quite ready for that at the moment. Instead, he unveiled two new final covers...</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//static3.paizo.com/image/product/catalog/PZO/PZO1139_120.jpg"><img src = "//static3.paizo.com/image/product/catalog/PZO/PZO1139_360.jpeg"></a>
<a href = "//static3.paizo.com/image/product/catalog/PZO/PZO1140.jpg"><img src = "//static3.paizo.com/image/product/catalog/PZO/PZO1140_360.jpeg"></a></div>

<p>And the brand-new shifter iconic character for November's <a href = "/products/btpy9sjz?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Ultimate-Wilderness"><em>Ultimate Wilderness</em></a>...</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/PZO1140-Shifter.jpg"><img src = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/PZO1140-Shifter_360.jpeg"></a></div>

<p>The new shifter class is best described being to the druid as paladins are to clerics. Oh, and they can get claws. EVERYONE GETS CLAWS! While the shifter gains access to a  number of animalistic aspects, it scales until it receives the capstone ability to simultaneously access 5 of these at one time. Imagine it now: a part bear, part owl, all mighty mean clawing machine!</p>

<p>PaizoCon would not be the show it is without our Organized Play programs. Organized Play Coordinator Tonya Woldridge and John Compton introduced us the upcoming Pathfinder Society Roleplaying and Adventure Card Guild seasons, which for the first time will be intertwined and following the same storyline. You can look forward to the launch of Faction's Favor in two and a half months at Gen Con 50.</p>

<div class = "blurbCenter"><a href = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/PFS-NextSeason.jpg"><img src = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/PFS-NextSeason_500.jpeg"></a></div>

<p>We also have a new program launching at Gen Con to support Starfinder. The Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild begins with the Year of the Scoured Stars. A disaster has befallen the Starfinder Society, and it's the role of you to rebuild the organization and determine its future. If you missed it, Starfinder Society Developer Thurston Hillman detailed some of the finer points for the upcoming program <a href = "/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ljuj?A-Talk-About-Cooperation">on the blog yesterday afternoon</a>.</p>

<p>I mentioned our amazing and illustrious crew of Venture-Officers above, and it goes without saying that these folks are some of the coolest people I've had the pleasure of meeting and working with. This years' Volunteer of the Year award was presented to Venture-Lieutenant, David Jacobson, for all of his hard work in the Pathfinder Society Adventure Card Guild, and coordinating with the Paizo and Lone Shark teams to make the Adventure Card Game thrive. Please join us in congratulating David and thanking him for all of his contributions to the ACG!</p>

<p>The latter half of the presentation covered a number of our licensed projects, including: Pathfinder: Kingmaker, Pathfinder Adventures, Pathfinder Battles, Syrinscape SoundSets (which are going to be available in retail stores this summer!!!), <a href = "/paizo/news/v5748eaic9vp6?Pathfinder-RPG-to-be-Made-into-Pathfinder">a newly announced digital CCG with 37 Games</a>, and so much more! I defer to our expert Director of Licensing, and there will be an updating covered everything we had the opportunity to show off this coming Friday!</p>

<p>If you are at PaizoCon <i>right now</i> and have a spare moment, check out the Delve tables, where we've switched to showing off Starfinder! I'm going to get on the road down to SeaTac and meet y'all there! Have an excellent weekend, and we'll see you on the other side!</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline">A Talk About Cooperation</h1>
 
<p class="date">Saturday, May 27, 2017</p>

<div itemprop = "articlebody">

<p itemprop="description">There are three important duties for every Pathfinder field agent: Explore, Report, and Cooperate. These tenants remain a core foundation of the Starfinder Society organization. Today, I want to talk a little bit about cooperation, specifically factions and how they fit into the Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild.</p>

<p>Every good Starfinder knows the importance of working together with fellow field agents. Engaging in some 'jolly cooperation' is fundamental to a successful mission. Factions in the Starfinder Society build upon this concept. Each faction is a distinct organization that operates within the Starfinder Society, with each faction pursuing independent goals while aiding the Society's overall goals of exploring, reporting, and yes, cooperating. You're probably familiar with this model if you've ever had a character in the Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild.</p>

<p>So what makes factions in Starfinder Society different? Well, I'm glad you asked!</p>

<h2>Fame and Reputation</h2>
<p>There are two important scores for every Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild character: Fame and Reputation. Fame is a collection of points that represent overall good standing within the Starfinder Society and can be spent for goods and services (similar to Prestige Points in Pathfinder Society). Reputation is a growing score that is never spent and instead represents the character's standing with the various factions within the Starfinder Society. The higher the Reputation a character has with a faction, the more services (read: tasty tasty rewards) become available for that character to spend his Fame points on. Building a character's Reputation across factions is an important way for the character to call in special favors, such as requisitioning an enhanced starship component or getting some publicity to reap greater rewards from a Day Job check.</p>

<p>Huh, wait a second, I said factions, as in plural! That must mean...</p>

<div class="blurb180"><a href="/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7101-StarfinderSociety.jpg"><img src="/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7101-StarfinderSociety_180.jpeg"></a>
<p><i>Illustration by Pavel Rtishev</i></p></div>

<h2>One Character, Multiple Factions</h2>
<p>Characters in Starfinder are not tied to one specific faction. Instead, characters are encouraged to branch out and dabble in assisting different factions. Each time a character assists a faction, or champions them as part of ongoing operations, that character earns Reputation. This doesn't stop a character from fully dedicating herself to one of the Starfinder Society's five starting factions. In fact, focusing on a single faction is still a very viable way to progress a character.</p>

<p>Branching out over multiple factions allows characters to reap the rewards of those factions. A character with ties to the Dataphiles&mdash;one of our previously announced factions&mdash;might earn enough Reputation to gain the assistance of a 'digital imp' program that acts as an ally able to perform various computer-related tasks. Another character might dive into another faction and earn the ability to requisition important starship components in preparation for an upcoming starship combat encounter. A character who dabbles with both factions could earn both benefits, but miss out on other available bonuses at higher tiers of Reputation with each faction.</p>

<p>For those of you worried about accessing essential rewards; maybe a raise dead so you don't die (or stay dead), or something to cure that awful space leprosy you contracted... well, we've got you covered! While all factions have individual Reputation scores to track, there's also a list of services available to 'All Factions', gained at certain thresholds of Reputation. Unlike the thresholds tracked for individual factions, the 'All Factions' Reputation threshold is determined by totaling your Reputation across all factions with which you have Reputation. So a character with 15 Reputation with Dataphiles and 20 Reputation with another faction, would be able to spend Fame on anything available on the 'All Factions' list with a threshold of 35 Reputation or less.</p>

<h2>Championing, Faction Boons and Faction Missions</h2>
<p>So this brings us to our last point: how do I gain Reputation with a faction?</p>

<p>As part of character creation, every Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild character gets to select a free 'champion boon' from a faction of her choice. This boon is a faction boon&mdash;we'll be talking more about boon slots in a future blog, but for now just know that you can only have one faction boon slotted per scenario. The champion boon allows the associated character to collect Reputation during the course of a normal scenario. So if you gain 2 Fame during the course of the upcoming <em>Starfinder Society Scenario #01-02: Fugitive on the Red Planet</em>, then you'll get 2 Reputation with whatever faction champion boon you have slotted.</p>

<p>Want to get more faction champion boons, so you can pick-up Reputation with other factions? You sure can! Every faction has the ability to purchase a champion boon between scenarios for a low Fame cost.</p>

<p>But what about faction missions? Pathfinder Society has entire storylines involving its factions. Will Starfinder Society have these too? Yes, yes it will! Not only will faction missions contribute to the overall storyline of a faction, but these missions will also award additional Reputation rewards, beyond the Fame and Reputation of a standard scenario, but ONLY with the associated faction. This means that it could be very likely that if your character is championing one faction, he might end up with some scattered Reputation among other factions as a result of playing scenarios that are faction missions. In fact, the first faction mission will be one of our Gen Con releases, <em>Starfinder Society #01-03: Yesteryear's Truth</em>, which is a mission related to the...</p>

<p>Oh, I can't say the name of the faction? Seriously?</p>

<p class = "tiny"><i>*feels John and Tonya glaring at me as I try to spill all the Starfinder Society beans*</i></p>

<p class = "tiny"><i>Organized Play Lead Developer's note: *John gives Thursty the stink-eye*</i></p>

<p>Fine! Maybe we can save exactly which faction for another blog post.</p>

<p>Well, thanks for listening (er... reading?) this post. I'm excited to hear all of your thoughts on Starfinder Society factions as described here and what sort of role you hope to see them take in our shared campaign. Please, post in the comments and let myself and the rest of the Organized Play team know!</p>

<p itemprop="description">As soon as we announced Starfinder, there were fans that wanted to know what kind of options there would be for the heavy-armor-wearing, magic-plasma-cannon-firing, jet-packed combatant character. While any Starfinder character can do those things if they dedicate themselves to getting the needed resources, the character who does it most easily (and gets the most class features designed to work with such actions) is the soldier. This is the description the soldier gets in the <a href = "/products/btpy9qy1"><em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>Conflict is an inevitable result of life. On every world that harbors complex living organisms, creatures battle one another for dominance, resources, territory, or ideals. Whether you've taken up arms to protect others, win glory, exact revenge, or simply earn a living, you are the perfect embodiment of this truth. You're an expert at combat of all types but tend to prefer heavy armor and weapons&mdash;the bigger, the better. You may be a career soldier, a fresh mercenary recruit, or a lone wolf who rejects authority, but whether rushing in for hand-to-hand combat or firing tactical barrages, you're a consummate warrior, never hesitating to put yourself in the line of fire to protect your friends.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Soldiers are masters of weapons and armor of all types, with a good base attack bonus progression (and good Fortitude and Will save progressions); proficiency in light armor, heavy armor, and grenades; and proficiency (and eventually specialization) in basic and advanced melee weapons, small arms, longarms, heavy weapons, and sniper weapons. Since small arms and many basic melee weapons gain only half the damage boost from specialization that longarms and heavy weapons do, soldiers often prefer to use the bulkier weapon options to maximize the damage they deal. Since specializing in heavy weapons first requires you to be proficient with heavy weapons, which in turn requires proficiency with longarms, it's a much more significant investment for any other class to do the same.</p>

<p>But a soldier is not simply a killer or thug&mdash;she's a trained professional combatant with access to thousands of years of military theory and modern education systems. That education tends to be pretty focused, but it's still enough to get the solider 8 class skills and 4 skill points per level. The Athletics skill covers the need to climb, jump, and swim to get to advantageous positions in combat (though by 2nd or 3rd level, jump jets are a common armor upgrade that easily increases mobility, and by 5th or 6th level they're likely to be replaced by a jetpack armor upgrade). That still leaves 3 skill points even for a soldier with a 10 Intelligence to spread around class skills such as Acrobatics (useful if you want to get the most out of that jetpack, but not necessary for basic flight), Engineering, Intimidate, Medicine, Piloting, Profession, and Survival.</p>

<p>Since the soldier class's focus is clearly on combat, there's much more to her offensive and defensive abilities than just base attack bonuses, proficiencies, and specializations. Every soldier begins play with a fighting style, which grants special combat options tied to a specific approach to combat as the soldier gains levels. There are 7 fighting styles to choose from&mdash;arcane assailant, armor storm, blitz, bombard, guard, hit-and-run, and sharpshoot. A soldier also picks up some of a second fighting style beginning at 9th level. In addition to fighting styles, a soldier gains gear boosts that enhance the soldier's effectiveness with specific equipment (such as anchoring arcana, armored advantage, laser accuracy, and plasma immolation) at 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, and a bonus combat feat at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter.</p>

<p>The bonus combat feats leave the soldier free to use the feats all characters gain at every odd level to expand beyond combat effectiveness. Other than proficiencies and specializations, feats generally have at most one other feat and a few base attack or ability score minimums as prerequisites, making even a few bonus feats able to cover a wide range of options. (For example, the Shot on the Run feat requires only Mobility, a +4 base attack bonus, and a 15 Dexterity&mdash;all easily achieved by a soldier.) Even at 1st level, any soldier could take Skill Synergy to gain 2 new skills as class skill. Or if a player preferred, by 2nd level a soldier can have selected Weapon Focus and then Versatile Focus to gain the benefit of Weapon Focus with every weapon with which the soldier is proficient.</p>

<p>Since fighting styles are going to be an important part of any soldier's design, here's a look at the 5th-level ability from the arcane assailant fighting style.</p>

<blockquote>
<h3>Secret of the Magi (SU)</h3>
<p class = "stat-block">When you imbue a weapon with the rune of the eldritch knight, in addition to its normal benefits, the rune grants the weapon one of the following weapon fusions of your choice: <i>ethereal, flaming, frost, merciful,</i> or <i>shock</i>. The weapon can't gain a fusion it already has, and this bonus fusion doesn't count toward the maximum total level of fusions the weapon can have at once. The bonus fusion ends when the weapon ceases to be imbued with the rune of the eldritch knight. For more information on fusions, see page 191.</p>

<p>With that, we've covered more than half of the Starfinder classes&mdash;check out <a href = "/starfinder"><b>paizo.com/starfinder</b></a> to find links to previous blogs presenting the envoy, mystic, operative, and soldier. We're going to take a little break from classes next week in order to preview some other elements of the game, but in the months before the game's release this August, we'll preview the remaining three&mdash;the mechanic, solarian, and technomancer!</p>

<p><a href = "/paizocon">PaizoCon</a> is just a few days away, and Pathfinder Society will be there in full force! Let's take a look at what's debuting that the convention.</p>

<p>The first is <a href = "/products/btpy9rev?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-820-Torrents-Last-Will"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-20: Torrent's Last Will</em></a>, a Tier 7-11 adventure that continues the our ongoing Plane of Water storyline that began with <a href = "/products/btpy9reu?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-819-Treacherous-Waves"><em>Treacherous Waves</em></a>. A sahuagin warlord has captured a powerful artifact that threatens the Society and its allies. In this adventure by Cole Kronewitter, the PCs embark on an expedition into the dangerous depths of the Plane of Water, in the process teaming up with undine soldiers and a haughty brine dragon. Whereas some of Season 8's adventures have kept to the safer corners of their respective elemental planes, "Torrent's Last Will" makes the most of its aquatic setting in terms of hazards, encounters, and locations. Pack your swim trunks!</p>

<p>PaizoCon is also one of our most popular times to release special events, and this year we're doing something a little different with some very familiar aspects. On its surface, <a href = "/products/btpy9s15/discuss?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-899-The-Solstice-Scar"><em>Pathfinder Society Special #8-99: The Solstice Scar</em></a> is a multi-table interactive special like many that have come before, including ways in which individual tables can contribute to the entire event's goals and affect neighboring groups. In terms of structure, though, it's a very different beast. Whereas past interactive specials have been central to a season's storyline and never changed, "The Solstice Scar" is what I've referred to as a modular special&mdash;a special event whose pieces we can swap out. What you'll have a chance to play at PaizoCon, Gen Con, and later conventions is Version A, which consists of three 90-minute parts of the ongoing story (Parts 1, 2, and 3). Around the beginning of 2018 (we're still nailing down an exact date), we're going to swap out one of the parts, introduce Part 4, and re-release the adventure as Version B. Not only does Version B advance the story, but it's also playable for credit again as though it were a completely new adventure! We'll be releasing several version over the coming seasons, providing events worldwide a regularly updated special event that they can offer mid-season.</p>

<p>With a strange new format, we needed a tested author who's handled strange assignments before. Andrew Hoskins took the challenge and has written the first four parts of the adventure, beginning with an incident in the Blakros Museum and spiraling into an epic journey across Avistan to study an ancient Kellid ritual, uncover a forgotten chapter of the Shining Crusade, and do battle with a truly reprehensible evil. I look forward to joining you in its debut on Sunday night at PaizoCon!</p>

<p>Speaking of PaizoCon, the Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild and Pathfinder Society Adventure Card Guild represent only a fraction of what's going on this weekend. We'll be announcing Season 9's name and theme at the PaizoCon Preview Banquet on Saturday night. Immediately afterward, I'm hosting the much-beloved post-banquet trivia contest, whose prizes include gift certificates, the acclaim of your peers, and ample opportunities to troll me by writing weird answers to questions (an equally beloved tradition). If you'd rather ask questions than answer them, you should also attend the Organized Play Q&A panel from 5-6 pm on Sunday. The whole team will be there to answer your burning questions about Season 9, Starfinder Society, and much more!</p>

<p>Beyond that, watch for us in the halls. We're happy to chat about our work, your experiences, freelance work opportunities, and what could happen in future adventures. After all, the modular special concept came out of a conversation Linda and I had while hanging out in the Sagamore Ballroom, and Thurston and I figured out a major portion of Season 8's plotline while having a chat at the Paizo booth at Gen Con. Who knows what great things we could brainstorm this weekend.</p>

<p>See you there!</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline">The Sounds of PaizoCon Approach!</h1>

<p class="date">Tuesday, May 23, 2017</p>

<div itemprop="articlebody">

<div class="blurb360"><a href="/image/content/Blog/20170523-MaskedBen.jpg"><img src="/image/content/Blog/20170523-MaskedBen_360.jpeg"></a></div>

<p itemprop="description">I am very excited to be heading back to Seattle with Syrinscape for <a href = "/paizocon">PaizoCon 2017</a>. Syrinscape has had such huge growth over the last twelve months and we are keen to hang out with our best most devoted fans at PaizoCon, and we've got some really great plans for our stay too.</p>

<p>Probably one of the most fun things we did last year was our search for the perfect Green Dragon for the beloved <a href = "/products/btpy9pvj?Syrinscape-Dragons-Demand-SoundPack"><em>Dragon's Demand</em></a> module, so this year we are amplifying this to the max. This year we are going to put absolutely everybody who gives a voice into a great big <em>Shoggoth SoundSet</em>. You know, CR 19... blow your brain away, kinda thing! Think the Borg, with green tentacles.</p>

<p>I am also running sound for a few of the celebrity events, don't miss <a href = "/events/v5748mkg0butb">"Celebrity Gaming with Amber E Scott"</a>. Game Master Greg Vaughan and I have been scheming to make life maximally difficult for this great panel of star players.</p>

<p>I'll be talking at a seminar about immersion, which promises to be really interesting, and doing sound for a game of <a href = "/pathfinder/adventurePath/strangeAeons">Strange Aeons</a> with the actual lead developer running the game. How cool is that?!</p>

<p>Most excitingly however are the little surprises we have in everybody's PaizoCon welcome bags. Long story short, this March I visited the Paizo offices in Seattle. As well as talking business, dreaming and scheming about Syrinscape's new Starfinder SoundSets, and playing a fantastic game of Pathfinder, I also grabbed Jason Bulmahn and James Jacobs, put them in a quiet room and had some fun building a couple of SoundSets. As a result of the madness and much giggling that went on in that room, I'm now very pleased to present you with two new NPCs to use in your Pathfinder games. With James Jacobs we built a fantastically colorful Tavern Keep, a purveyor of comfortable accommodation, useful information and food and drink of questionable quality. Perfect for any Fantasy adventure that begins in a Tavern. We can't imagine when that might be useful. Jason Bulmahn brings you his notorious Priest of Razmir, a terrifyingly convincing rendition of these usurious, dishonest, blackmailing charlatans. If Jason ever starts a religion, run for the hills.</p>

<p>These have turned out so well, I couldn't resist taking it one step too far. Yup, stick-masks for everybody. I dare you, load up the Razmir Preist on your phone and proselytize to the poor unsuspecting hotel guests at the Hilton. Or hold whole conversations between twin Tavern Keeps. Most importantly, I want photos!</p>

<p>So, if you're lucky enough to be at PaizoCon this year, do make sure you drop by the Syrinscape stand and shake my hand, give your voice, share a laugh and generally geek out with me and the Syrinscape team about the game I love most of all, Pathfinder.</p>

<p>Also... can't WAIT for Sunday's Pathfinder Society Special!</p>

<p>In classic vesk fashion, Obozaya Ymeros lets her friends shorten her name to "Obo," but not even Damoritosh himself can protect those who attempt to use her nickname without earning it first.</p>

<p itemprop="description">Obozaya was born on Vesk Prime, the planetary capital of the Veskarium, to a family of low-level military bureaucrats. Distinguishing herself with her determination and ferocity on the sports field and in the dueling ring&mdash;if not in her academic studies&mdash;Obozaya quickly established herself as a top-notch military cadet, enlisting as soon as her basic studies were complete.</p>

<p>Obozaya took to military life like a swamp lion to water, and soon outpaced many in her cohort. In Veskarium society, social status is most easily earned through excellence in combat, and Obo had no desire to spend her entire life at the same forgettable rank as her parents. Though her dreams of glory were hardly unique, she nevertheless proved herself in several early battles, putting down a vicious rebellion among the feline barbarians of Vesk-6.</p>

<p>Yet in her youthful arrogance, Obozaya overlooked the power of political connection. After dueling and deeply shaming another member of her unit&mdash;one with family ties to high-ranking military officials&mdash;she found herself promoted and assigned to patrol a section of frozen tundra on Vesk-8, where the staunchly pacifist residents refused to give her any opportunity for righteous combat. It soon became clear that neither appeals to her superiors nor prayers to Damoritosh the Conqueror were going to get her a better assignment. Thus, as her first term of enlistment drew to a close, a frustrated Obozaya took the Soldier's Due, the time-honored vesk tradition of being honorably discharged and taking your government-issue armor and weapons with you.</p>

<p>Still in love with the idea of one day becoming a major player in vesk society, and disgusted by the idea that politics could exist within the Veskarium's vaunted military meritocracy, Obozaya followed in the footsteps of many other legendary vesk warriors and left home to work as a mercenary in the Pact Worlds. Here, at last, she found what she'd been searching for: an endless series of battles and adventures, with no restrictions but her own sense of honor. Rather than signing on with an established mercenary company, Obozaya found herself better suited to working with small groups of explorers and adventurers. Small teams mean more glory per person when you succeed, and she often finds herself the sole front-line fighter on a crew, which appeals to both her vanity and her showboating style. As she's fond of saying, battle is too important to leave to amateurs, and Obozaya believes that the best way to win a fight is to move fast and hit hard. Though she's drifted away from Damoritosh's faith in recent years, coming to appreciate some other races' criticisms of the Conqueror, she still adores using his sacred doshko for her close-up fighting.</p>

<p>Personality-wise, Obozaya is a study in contrasts. While she appreciates material wealth and creature comforts, her true desire is for recognition. This is perhaps best exemplified by the holoprojector on her back, which usually projects a modified version of Damoritosh's symbol to advertise her as a warrior for hire, but which is capable of projecting a personalized holographic war-banner in combat to make sure the enemy knows exactly who's coming for them. Brilliant on the battlefield, Obozaya nevertheless finds herself a little slow on the draw in most intellectual pursuits, having little patience for any education not directly related to her vocation. She believes that honor demands honesty, and while she's not against lying by omission, she would rather die than break her word or renege on a contract. In conversations with new people, she's either unnervingly stoic or direct to the point of rudeness, and thinks that most species talk more than they need to as an attempt to cover up their cowardice.</p>

<p>All of which makes it that much more surprising to discover how much her companions adore her. Sure, Obo may explain her loyalty as a mercenary's pragmatism, yet everyone in her crew knows they can count on "the big lizard" to pull them out of a scrape, no matter the cost. As with many vesk, her gruff manner is punctuated with sudden outpourings of emotion, and with her characteristic directness, Obo finds no fear or shame in telling her friends how much she loves them. Much of her life is spent on or training for missions, yet when Obozaya sets out to celebrate a success, it's with her trademark bombastic zeal. Eschewing the berserker drugs favored by some of her kindred, she's nevertheless fond of the Veskarium nose-hookahs sometimes called "dragon's breath," as well as the mildly hallucinogenic brain snails of Vesk-2 and other traditional vesk snacks. More than one bar has been sacrificed to (and well compensated for) her parties, and the heavy bass of her beloved revelaz dance-pop beats is notorious for bursting rivets on ship bulkheads.</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline">Interview with Gears of Faith Author Gabrielle Harbowy</h1>
<p class="date">Saturday, May 21, 2017</p>

<div itemprop="articlebody">

<p itemprop="description"><i>In the madness of the <a href = "/starfinder">Starfinder</a> launch, I wasn't able to do my usual blog about the new <a href = "/pathfinder/tales">Pathfinder Tales novel</a>, which was a real shame, given that Gabrielle Harbowy's <a href = "/products/btpy9n4o?Pathfinder-Tales-Gears-of-Faith"></i>Gears of Faith<i></a> is a novel that's been so eagerly awaited by fans here on the Paizo boards!

But enough from me&mdash;let's hear from Liane and Gabrielle!</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p><b>Liane Merciel: What inspired the two main characters in this piece?</b></p>

<p><b>Gabrielle Harbowy</b>: I love Pathfinder's take on gnomes, which was why I wanted to feature one in the first place. In Pathfinder, gnomes crave novelty and don't have many hang-ups about how they get it. They're long-lived, fey-tied creatures, so they have an outsider perspective on humanity. I had a great time diving into the gnome mindset. I've come to love Zae's skewed perspective on the mostly human world around her. She gives me an opportunity to take things to their literal extreme, to question things people don't question, to think about the names of things, and to approach a fascinating world with the kind of wide-eyed wonder that we all eventually lose when we live in a place and see it every day.</p>

<div class="blurb360"><a href="/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8538-Keren.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8538-Keren_360.jpeg"></a>
<p><i>Illustration by Roberto Pitturru</i></p></div>

<p>Keren came into being because a character like Zae has to have a contrast to work off of. Keren gave me an opportunity to explore and chip away at the stereotype in our culture of holy knights as emotionless, unquestioning valor-machines.</p>

<p>When I write Zae, I bring out that playful, questioning side of myself, and I often channel Dr. Walter Bishop from <i>Fringe</i> as my guide. When I write Keren, I bring out that using-cynicism-as-a-shield side of myself. My hope is that both characters ring authentic because both of them are driven by sides of me. There isn't a me-analogue and then "the other main character." This is especially important because the novel is the first time we get to see Keren's point of view.</p>

<p>I originally envisioned Keren as spending more time on horseback, so Zae also needed a mount to ride if they were going to adventure together. I decided early on that I wanted her to ride a dog, but it was a generic dog at first. It wasn't until I met Rufus, a friend's Samoyed puppy, that Appleslayer got a personality and a name. At eight months, Rufus was big enough for a 3'6" child&mdash;already taller than a gnome&mdash;to ride. He was a goofball, and he wasn't finished growing. (As of now, full-grown, his paws are bigger than my hands.) I knew this was the dog for Zae.</p>

<p><b>LM: What inspired the story itself? What part of it came first&mdash;plot, characters, setting, or something else? And how did you build the rest from there?</b></p>

<p><b>GH</b>: The characters got their start in the short story "Inheritance," to really great reader response. When it came time to build a novel I knew I wanted to tailor it around them. I'd only written short stories, though, and I had trouble coming up with a book-sized plot&mdash;especially if Keren was tied to Lastwall and her vigilance against the Whispering Tyrant.</p>

<p>James Sutter and I brainstormed quite a bit on where else a Knight of Ozem could go without feeling like she was neglecting her calling, and James suggested Absalom. As a bonus, even though it's the biggest city in the world, it hadn't been featured in a novel yet. I was very excited to have the chance to bring it to life. Especially fun was the Clockwork Cathedral, and the structure of its cognates. Very little is written about it, so I got to think about what it would be like to work there, to flesh it out and make it feel real... all without revealing any of its secrets.</p>

<p>The plot was harder. I'd never written anything as complex as a novel has to be. Just by virtue of having to take up so many words, a novel has to have a lot more going on than a short story does. And I didn't want them to be super powerful, so the threat had to be something they could face, but that still had some far-reaching consequences to make it important. As it stands, the conflict in the story provides a physical, intellectual, and emotional challenge to Keren and Zae, and they have to fight their way into the team that confronts it.</p>

<p>A random aside</b>: the villain got his name from a kid my niece hated at school that year. (I got serious aunt-points.)</p>

<p><b>LM: What made you decide to pair up Zae and Keren?</b></p>

<p><b>GH</b>: What I really wanted most was to normalize their diversity. Here's a couple who've been together a while and aren't in the new romance phase of a relationship, and they've obviously made it work. It's not a coming out story, because coming out isn't the only story. And there's no way to dismiss it with "well, it won't last." It's lasted. It doesn't matter to the story that they're both female, or that they're not both human, or whatever. They're people having genuine emotions and genuine quirks and flaws. It's not the big reveal or the punch line or the plot twist. It's just people being honest with themselves about who they are and/or who they love.</p>

<p>In our world, people are still marginalized for these things. And because they're not who our society sees as its default, it's rare for people who identify in diverse ways to be able to find themselves depicted in fiction. My intent was for diverse readers to find the perspective refreshing, and for readers who hadn't come across much of that sort of thing to maybe find their horizons widened and assumptions challenged.</p>

<p><b>LM: How exactly did they meet? I've always wondered that.</b></p>

<p><b>GH</b>: I think they met in Vigil, while shopping. There's a line about Keren helping Zae by reaching something on a high shelf for her. :)</p>

<p><b>LM: There was a long gap between the release of the short story and the release of the novel. What kept you enthusiastic through that?</b></p>

<p><b>GH</b>: The Paizo forums helped so much. The readers loved Zae and Keren and Appleslayer&mdash;Apple in particular has some devoted fans!&mdash;and the clamoring for a novel never really stopped. Not to mention the requests for miniature figures, cards, and other accessories. (And yes, I would <i>love</i> to see Appleslayer as a mini.)</p>

<p>Publishing is a strange beast. Between turning in the manuscript for <em>Gears of Faith</em> and seeing it come out in print, I wrote, sold, and published another whole novel (<em>Hellmaw: Of the Essence</em>). And that's honestly pretty normal. Working for publishers, I saw delays happen all the time, and that helped me keep from taking it too personally. They can only put out so many books in a year, and they've got to balance the list, is what it comes down to.</p>

<p>In the end, I think that the experience was good for Zae and Keren. I learned a lot from writing my second first novel, after I had the confidence from having already finished one, and that ultimately helped me come back and strengthen this book.</p>

<p><i>Illustration by Remko Troost</i></p></div>

<p><b>LM: Where did the title of the novel come from?</b></p>

<p><b>GH</b>: From [Pathfinder Tales author] Chris A. Jackson, actually. I'm great at coming up with titles for other people, but awful at coming up with titles for myself. There were words and phrases I had to avoid, because they were either too similar to other titles or because they gave too much away, so of course the moment someone says, for instance, "Don't use the word <i>blood</i>," all your ideas include the word <i>blood</i>. I had a two-column list of Pathfinder-title-sounding words to mix and match, I was so desperate, and I sent it to Chris with a short synopsis of the book. That was the one he came up with, along with a prediction that James Sutter would like it. I sent it along to James with a list of five or ten others, and sure enough, Chris's title was the one.</p>

<p><b>LM: Do you think there's a central theme to <em>Gears of Faith</em>? If so, what is it, and how do you see it reflected in the story and its characters?</b></p>

<p><b>GH</b>: I think at its core, the book is about overcoming fear of failure.</p>

<p>Keren is afraid of failing&mdash;failing Zae, failing her father by learning magic, failing her deity by not believing well or strongly enough. The villain is not afraid enough of failing. He's convinced himself that he can become a god. Between the two extremes is Zae. She's never really cared about failing before, but through her relationship with Keren (and the events in "Inheritance") she's learned that failure can impact others and have an emotional cost.</p>

<p class="date">Saturday, May 20, 2017</p>

<div itemprop="articlebody">

<div class="blurb360"><a href="/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7101-MysticEmpath.jpg"><img src="/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7101-MysticEmpath_360.jpeg"></a></div>

<p itemprop="description">The setting of <a href = "/starfinder">Starfinder</a> is very much a  science fantasy universe, with a lot of science fiction ideas mashed together with more fantastical and supernatural concepts. This isn't an accident, but an inevitable conclusion to asking the question "What happens if advanced technology becomes commonplace in the Pathfinder universe?" In Starfinder, it's well accepted that there are forces beyond the understanding of pure science which, whether you want to refer to them as arcane, divine, or psychic, are best thought of as just "magic." There are options for players who want to add just a little magic to their character (ranging from the Connection Inkling and Psychic Power feats to the phrenic adept archetype, which can be accessed by any class), but significant magical ability is primarily in the hands of the mystic and technomancer classes.</p>

<p>We'll talk about the technomancer later on, but for now, here's the description the mystic gets in the <a href = "/products/btpy9qy1"><em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>You understand that what most people call magic is simply an expression of the innate connection between all things, and you intuitively tap into this unseen power to create strange effects. You may conceptualize the source of your magic as divine grace, a manipulation of fundamental energy, or an unlocking of psychic potential, but always with the knowledge that you are a conduit channeling forces greater than yourself. Though you may study, you understand that spellcasting&mdash;like all existence&mdash;is messy and intuitive, and you specialize in biology and mental systems too complex to be perfectly understood by science. You sense the intangible and exploit your bonds with others, whether to bolster them or bend them to your will.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>While a great deal of a mystic's focus is on more esoteric truths that are represented by class features, they are still scholarly enough to gain 6 skill points per level and have 12 class skills. Since their abilities may require attack rolls in combat, they have the same average base attack bonus as the envoy and operative, but only gain proficiency (and eventually specialization) with light armor, small arms, and basic melee weapons. Their focus on comprehending the secrets of existence give them a good Will save progression, and makes Wisdom their key ability score.</p>

<p>Mystics' studies also grant them access to mystic spells, ranging from 0-level to 6th level, which represent a significant part of their power. Mystic spells are more likely to focus on philosophy, natural systems, mental endeavors, and living things than the more physics- and technology-oriented technomancer spells. This gives them access to numerous charm and emotion spells, spells focusing on telepathy and thought, and spells that cure or restore balance to living things. However, they also have some powers drawn from natural forces such as radiation and some force-based telekinetic powers. How a mystic operates can be strongly influenced by their choice of spells known&mdash;<i>fear</i>, <i>force blast</i>, and <i>hold person</i> are all useful 2nd-level offensive mystic spells, but each comes with its own advantages and limitations.</p>

<p>All mystics gain some ability to link to other creatures, which manifests as a healing touch used once per day at 1st level, but expands into a mindlink you can establish with creatures by touch, and eventually a telepathic bond you can maintain with up to six creatures at a time. Mystics can gain other powers that work through this connection, depending on their chosen connection.</p>

<p>What's a connection, you ask? Much of the focus of a mystic comes from their choice of a connection: a link to some force that the mystic sees as the source of their power, and which helps shape their approach to their abilities. Many mystics serve as clergy and see their gods as the source of their powers (though the priest theme is available to a character of any class), but a connection can also be to a philosophy, a mysterious patron, or nearly anything else a player chooses. Regardless of what power fuels the mystic's connection, each connection has a specific focus that grants the mystic a set of powers and bonus spells known. The mystic selects from the akashic, empath, healer, mindbreaker, overlord, or star shaman connection, which grant powers ranging from access to the Akashic Record to the power to explode heads.</p>

<p>Here's a sample of a connection power, this one gained by mindbreakers at 3rd level.</p>

<blockquote>
<h3>Backlash (SU)</h3>
<p class = "stat-block">Whenever a foe succeeds at a Will save against one of your spells and completely negates the effect, that foe takes 1 nonlethal damage for each mystic level you have. This is a mind-affecting pain effect.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Having examined the envoy, mystic and operative, next week we'll preview our most combatant-focused class, the soldier!</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline">The Golem Send-off</h1>

<p class="date">Friday, May 19, 2017</p>

<div itemprop="articlebody">

<p itemprop="description">As you may know from <a href = "/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ljtw?Wess-Last-Words">yesterday's Paizo blog</a>, former Editor-in-Chief F. Wesley Schneider has begun a new and exciting journey, leaving the offices of the Paizo building behind. And as you may have gleaned from that blog, remaining Paizonians have some words for Wes. And, without further delay, here they are!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Wes Schneider had been at Paizo less than a year the first time I completely changed his job and basically required him to be a superhero. It was a trend that would continue for more than a decade, but the difference is, that first time, I wasn't 100% certain it would work. Truth be told, although Wes had, at that point, served as an assistant editor on <em>Dragon</em> magazine for a half-dozen issues, I still wasn't 100% certain I could tell the difference between Wes and the magazine's other assistant editor, the late great Mike McArtor. Both had come to the company at the same time to do the same job, both were irritatingly young in a way that made me realize I was no longer the youngest scamp working on D&D in an official capacity, and both pretty much had the exact same haircut and facial hair. Both Wes and Mike had also worked with the previous <em>Dragon</em> editor to "relaunch" the magazine with an almost completely player-focused approach with <em>Dragon</em> #323. The only trouble was, as a long-time GM and lifetime reader of <em>Dragon</em>, I didn't really care for that approach. Fresh off my own relaunch of <em>Dungeon</em>, I knew that improving <em>Dragon</em> to be the magazine I thought it could be, I'd need to completely undo a lot of the work the previous team had done, within only about two months of them doing it in the first place. And I needed to figure out a way to have Wes and Mike do a lot of the dirty work for me. I took the two young lads out for lunch at the local Thai spot and said, essentially, "You know that relaunch you guys have been working so hard on? We're not going to do that anymore. Instead, we're going to do THIS."</p>

<p>It could have been an utter disaster. But Wes took the news like a champ, saw the potential in the changes I was proposing, and ably stepped up to the challenge. I was so impressed with Wes's attitude I made him the section editor of <em>Dragon</em>'s First Watch column. I did this mostly because I knew he could handle coordinating reams of monthly RPG industry news and new product reviews, but I also did it because I knew we couldn't pay Wes what he was worth and that the position would put Wes in the path of mountains of cool free stuff that people sent to the magazine in hopes of getting coverage. Things like gaming books, board games, soundtracks, action figures&mdash;you know, nerd stuff.</p>

<p>Thirteen years later, as I sit here writing this within hours of Wes's going away lunch, several of those dubious treasures are sitting on the "Free Table" right outside my office. Some of these well-loved artifacts are coated with a decade of dust, while others are well-loved desk trinkets looking for a new home. In the time between that first <em>Dragon</em> issue and today, as Wes prepares to move on to exciting new career and creative challenges, I've set countless near-impossibly outlandish tasks before Wes, and he has not just risen to the occasion each time, but he's basically one-shotted all of these monsters with style, grace, and aplomb. I'll miss Wes's level-headed clarity, his compassion for his fellow employees, his values, and his phenomenal creative contributions to the Pathfinder line, which alas will now have to come in the form of what I hope will be many freelance assignments.</p>

<p>And while I'll also miss Wes's amazing, can-do attitude and ability to achieve the impossible, I'm less worried about the impact of not having that around. You see, in the last 13 years Wes has been setting his own series of impossible challenges for his own staff of editors and developers. Following his example, they also exceed my expectations on a daily basis. Even though Wes will no longer be walking Paizo's halls after today, the clarity, compassion, values, and ability to achieve the impossible with grace and aplomb lives on thanks to his amazing example.</p>

<p>Thanks for helping me with <em>Dragon</em> magazine, Wes, and for Pathfinder and everything in between. We'll miss you terribly, but you've made such a huge impact on all of us here at Paizo that your legacy will continue for many years to come!</p>

<p>Erik Mona<br />
<i>Publisher</i></p>

<hr />

<p>Maybe 10 years ago, Wes took me aside and let me know that he'd accepted a job at Privateer Press, and would be leaving the company. I got all weepy and hugged him, making a big scene. A few hours later he told me he'd lied just to see what I'd do. ("I can't believe I got a hug out of it!" he mused.) So you can understand why I won't quite believe he's leaving until I see his office empty.</p>

<p>Wes was one of the first friends I made at Paizo, back when I was 20 years old and he was only a few years older, the two of us banding together to embrace our role as the department's hipster children. We actually shared our <em>Dungeon</em> magazine debut, co-writing the adventure "Shut-In" together in issue #128. (We would also write our first Adventure Path installment together, "The Lightless Depths" in <em>Dungeon</em>'s Savage Tide AP, but we eventually started talking to each other again after that one, so all's well that ends well.) I often say that my first years at Paizo were spent learning what was cool, and Wes was my primary teacher in that regard, hosting Educational Movie Nights in which he and Jacobs attempted to correct my character flaws by showing me classic horror films. For the last 13 years, we've constantly learned from each other, propping each other up as we stumbled our way into managing departments, exploring social media, or writing comics. He taught me how to write adventures. I taught him how to write novels. He taught me how to buy jeans that fit. I taught him how to stop using that terrible crunchy hair gel that made him look damp all the time. He taught me to accept my own sexuality. I taught him that his garbage disposal was a <i>perfectly acceptable</i> place to vomit after challenging Jason Bulmahn to a drinking contest. (Wes has never accepted my explanation that, since I was half Jason's size at the time and drunkenness is a factor of body weight, I'd actually won mathematically.)</p>

<p><i>2008&mdash;Wes and I at Erik Mona Day and Gen Con 2008, respectively.<br />
2010&mdash;Wes and I just boldly hiked over the hill behind the Paizo offices and discovered the fabled Treasure Mounds&mdash;colorful hills of broken glass for the nearby recycling plant.</i></p></div>

<p>I'm pretty sure that at every convention we've ever been to together, someone has mistaken us for each other (most notably one of his longtime family friends, leading to what may well have been Gen Con's Most Awkward Hug). And the weird thing is, it kind of makes sense&mdash;after this many years of friendship and collaboration, probably half my verbal tics and gestures come from Wes, to the point where <i>I can't even remember which half</i>. So Wes, while moving on is always bittersweet, you can take comfort in knowing that part of you will live on in this building long after you leave. (I'm talking about your office couch. I'm pretty sure the courts will give me joint custody.)</p>

<p>James L. Sutter<br />
<i>Creative Director</i></p>

<hr />

<p>Most of my best memories of working with Wes at Paizo are probably better left off this blog, so I'll keep this short. Wes has been a tireless advocate for the editorial team over the years, and more than that, a rock-solid friend who somehow always has the perfect piece of unexpected dry wit to get you through the rough patches. We'll miss you, Wes, but I'm happy for the bright and rewarding future you have ahead of you.<br />

<p>Christopher Carey<br />
<i>Senior Editor</i></p>

<hr />

<p>How do you pay adequate tribute to someone like Wes? Charming as hell; endlessly creative; never lazy in the work of making life better for his colleagues or repairing broken aspects of our games, our industry, and our world; always present as the company therapist (to be fair, Wes, you brought that one on yourself by putting a couch in your office); hilarious, especially in moments where humor and perspective were needed; generous to a fault with his time, brilliance, wisdom, and wit; creator of the best margin notes and doodles; deeply kind; mind-blowingly clever; and stunningly insightful.</p>

<p>He has been the genius loci of this place and this team for as long as I've been here, and we are all richer in spirit and creativity for having had the chance to work with him. May we do justice, as we go forward, to everything he's taught us.</p>

<p>Jessica Price<br />
<i>Project Manager</i></p>

<hr />

<p>Wes was one of the first people I worked with at Paizo. Together with Mike McArtor, we were the team behind <em>Dragon</em> up through its final print issue. While all of us had various jobs developing and editing the articles, Wes had an extra special assignment. He got us stuff! Back then, a section of the magazine was dedicated to new and exciting releases in the game industry and nerd culture in general. Wes put together these articles, which often entailed getting samples from the various companies. Once the articles were done and the products revealed, these samples would often be put up for grabs (if Wes didn't keep them himself). To this day, I still have a  Monty Python Horse Action Figure, that Wes got as part of a big contest, hiding in my desk. That was over a decade ago. Over the years, Wes has been part of the bedrock of Paizo and while I am sad to see him go, I am excited for him and his future endeavors. Now if I can just get him to send us some swag from his new job...</p>

<p><i>Monty Python Horse Action Figure</i></p></div>

<p>Jason Bulmahn<br />
<i>Lead Designer</i></p>

<hr />

<p>Wes was the first Paizo editor to reach out to me and the rest of the PathfinderWiki team asking if there was anything we needed in the site's earliest days, providing us with specially tailored blog posts and shoutouts to increase our content and traffic. He was also one of the first Paizo developers to give me a shot as a freelancer (he, Josh Frost, and Sean K Reynolds all gave me small assignments about the same time), so my career in the industry owes much to him recognizing my potential. In our time working together, Wes has taught me countless things, both relevant to the publishing industry and the creative process in general. But above all, Wes has been a great friend, hosting the absolute best themed 80s movie marathons and geeking out over the same comics and movies and video games that I do.</p>

<p>I'm sad to see you go, Wes, but excited for the opportunities that lie in your future. And I can't wait to play the games you'll make, engross myself in the stories you'll tell, and enjoy the worlds you are sure to create wherever you may go.</p>

<p>Mark Moreland<br />
<i>Developer</i></p>

<hr />

<p>As a fan, it's easy to gloss over a book's credits page. I did it for several years as I eagerly flipped straight to the newest classes, feats, and archetypes, rarely giving more than a casual glance at who the developers, authors, or editors were. Even so, I had friends who had played in Wes's PaizoCon games (and buzzed excitedly about it for days afterward), and when he chimed in on the messageboards, fans snapped to attention. I couldn't understand quite how important he was to Paizo until I started working here. Wes has been a tireless advocate for each of us, whether conveying conveying our needs to the executives or trumpeting our accomplishments to the world. He's always proven accommodating and encouraging to us, urging us to make our mark on the world and make the most of the setting&mdash;even the pieces that are his creations.</p>

<p>I may sass him often&mdash;probably as often as he returns the favor&mdash;but for all the snark, we all know that he's been there for us when we've needed it and given us space when we just needed to get things done. Paizo shall continue, and though we will feel his absence for years to come, we're ready for whatever lies ahead thanks to the example he set.</p>

<p>John Compton<br />
<i>Organized Play Lead Developer</i></p>

<hr />

<p>Wes has been a patient mentor and fierce advocate for those of us on his team, and an able peacekeeper between people who care deeply but in different directions about what we do (which is to say, everyone at Paizo). Despite his attempts to maintain a Machiavellian image, his visible distress whenever he had to ask us to do anything particularly arduous always gave away of his concern for us. Wes, I wish you the best, will miss you heaps, and hope your future collaborators appreciate you as much as you deserve! (P.s. No take-backs on the feathers&mdash;they must find a new surprise home.)</p>

<p>Judy Bauer<br />
<i>Managing Editor</i></p>

<hr />

<p>It's still hard to wrap my head around the fact that Wes is headed out of Paizo's doors soon for the final time. For what seemed like forever, Wes <i>was</i> Paizo, in my worldview.</p>

<p>Back at Gen Con 2011, he was the first friend from Paizo I met when I was digging for ways to break into the gaming industry. Luckily for me, the email thread that spawned with Wes from that meeting turned into one gig, and then many others. Then, the phone call (again, with Wes), and here I am in Redmond. I've always kept that first email thread with Wes in my inbox because it marked a turning point in my life, and so did meeting Wes.</p>

<p>Since that first Gen Con, I have unabashedly looked up to Wes personally and professionally, admired him, and felt a creative kinship with him. When we moved to Redmond, Wes became one of my best friends.</p>

<p>It is likely that I would not be in the tabletop gaming industry without Wes. It is almost certain that I would not work for Paizo as a developer if it were not for him. In many ways, Wes helped me discover who I want to be as a professional and as a creative.</p>

<p>You might be leaving the office, Wes, but you'll always be on the hook for that. And, before you can say it: <i>How dare you?!</i></p>

<p>Amanda Hamon Kunz<br />
<i>Developer</i></p>

<hr />

<p>Wes, I will greatly miss working with you. You've taught me so much in the five years that I've been here (and even more in the previous years while I was an up-and-coming freelancer). I thank you for giving me some my first pieces of freelance work for Paizo, always supporting my and other freelancer's work and ultimately giving me a job here. I quite literally wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you.</p>

<p>This has been a wonderful experience and your leadership and guidance over the time has made all the difference. We've come up with cool ideas together and imagined and developed wonderfully disturbing characters, stories, and monsters. As you go on to your next big thing, know that I'll keep a creepy lantern burning to attract all the scary monsters!</p>

<p>Adam Daigle<br />
<i>Developer</i></p>

<p>When I only knew F. Wesley Schneider as a name on a book byline, I imagined a very different man. With a tough and academic name like F. Wesley Schneider and a writing style that was witty and confrontational, clearly he would be enormous and muscular, jolly and well-read, but probably kind of a douche. Years later, at my first PaizoCon, I spent a good thirty minutes chatting with the sweetest, most optimistic, nonthreatening, well-dressed man at the entire hotel, talking about games and then... I want to say Zelda and Castlevania? Then he had to run to a panel, and I realized I'd never asked his name.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm Wes Schneider," he said, as if he were stunned that anyone in the world didn't know who he was.</p>

<p>"Wait, <i>you're</i> Wes Schneider," I responded, dumbstruck that he was a foot shorter than me. Then I ran off to get my copy of <em>Seven Days to the Grave</em> and made him sign it after his panel.</p>

<p>Ever since that day, I've rested comfortably in the knowledge that I could crush F. Wesley Schneider with my bare hands should the need arise. And thankfully, since that day, the need never has.</p>

<p>Wes Schneider is a unique man, above and beyond his extraordinary way with words and keen wit. He is gifted with deep empathy, and more compassion than any one person should be burdened with. He shepherds the best traits in others, and helps them find what they need in themselves. He teaches in a way that leaves you feeling empowered rather than chastised. He takes care of those around him, sacrificing his own health and time to do so.</p>

<p>He's my friend, and he has helped me become a better person. Working alongside him has been an extraordinary blessing.</p>

<p>Also, he's frustratingly good at <em>Battletoads</em>.</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline">Wes's Last Words</h1>

<p class="date">Thursday, May 18, 2017</p>

<div itemprop="articlebody">

<p>Tomorrow's my last day working at Paizo Inc.</p>

<p>How's that for not burying the lede?</p>

<div class = "blurb360"><a href = "//static2.paizo.com/image/product/magazine_issue/dragon/316/cover_500.jpg"><img src = "//static2.paizo.com/image/product/magazine_issue/dragon/316/cover_360.jpg"></a></div>

<p itemprop="description">I could write one heck of a self-indulgent retrospective. I'd start by going on about how I've been working at Paizo since November 2003 (I would have been 22) and how my first credit was as an assistant editor on <em>Dragon Magazine</em> #316. (I'd probably illustrate that section with that issue's cover.) Then I'd go on to talk about writing a ton of D&D stuff, starting to write adventures, and learning how magazine work is actually time travel. After that would be the scary but exciting times&mdash;starting Pathfinder Adventure Path, disguising a game as a textbook, long lines, yada yada. Things got wild after that.</p>

<p>But there's not really time for all of that. I've learned a lot in my time at Paizo, but two oft-stated truths have proven out again and again: one, never piss off your editor; two, I work with a bunch of jackals.</p>

<p>About this time tomorrow, there's going to be another blog right here. At that time, a bunch of folks who've had to look at me everyday&mdash;some for well over a decade&mdash;are going to have their opportunity to say their bon voyages.</p>

<p>And they're going to thoroughly roast me.</p>

<p>I didn't get here being stupid. I've been documenting, hoarding, recording, and preparing for this moment for most of my adult life. And I know that if you're going to get into a blog fight, fire first.</p>

<p>To that end, here are the secrets.</p>

<p><b>Adam Daigle</b>: Adam knows the time and place for everything&mdash;for getting things done, for getting a drink, for getting your abdomen severed from your thorax, and for not backing up claims that you're a bad-@#% cook. Most folks don't know that Adam is responsible for more issues of <em>Dragon Magazine</em> releasing on time than some people who worked on that magazine's staff. More than once something went down on a Friday and by Monday morning Adam just had it handled. He definitely knows the curse of becoming an editor's go-to guy. I have boundless respect for Adam's unique blend of solid writing and creepy swamp witchery and look forward to his next big thing, be it a mega-adventure, restaurant chain, or the burgeoning fiction career he's no good at hiding!</p>

<p><b>Adam Vick & Emily Crowell</b>: Adam and Emily might be two of the only truly sane souls at Paizo&mdash;stark comparisons against the rest of the company's wards. They both do fantastic work, but they're also the second generation of an experiment into how long it takes for normal designers to be infected with RPG gibberish. (Sarah was part of the initial research, but now she can tell you all about driders and bullywugs.) There's not much of an end goal here, and we couldn't ask for more in regard to design finesse, but I know there's collectively a lot of interest in debating the finer points of Bloodrager feats and outsider subtypes with Adam and Emily down the road.</p>

<p><b>Amanda Hamon Kunz</b>: Amanda's one of the most clever, most capable, most quietly depraved people I've ever had a pleasure of knowing. She wears a <i>ring of mind shielding</i>, but she's quick to say she just likes the look. (To quote Jessica Price, "There's a darkness in her.") I've thrown Amanda more&mdash;much more&mdash;than her fair share of trash-fires and she's never once so much as sighed or stabbed me in the face. Early on in our working arrangement I asked that, when the time comes, she make my end quiet and quick. She couldn't make any promises. I respect that. I'd say to watch out for Amanda, but it will be far less stressful to just let the inevitable come.</p>

<p><b>Chris Lambertz</b>: Chris cultivates the best stuffed critter shelf at Paizo. Her miniature army helps her fend off the endless press of tiny typhoons that endlessly wash across her desk. Her hordes also defend dual hidden fonts, one of boundless pragmatism and the other of boundless optimism. She uses these to look forward to better things even as she wrangles the calamity du jour. You might not know Chris, but she believes in you, the great person you are, and the better person you can be. If you ever receive moderation from her, count yourself lucky... then consider making deep spiritual improvements in your life.</p>

<p><b>Christopher Carey</b>: Aside from being a phenomenal editor, Chris is the most accomplished Paizo author you probably haven't read. He has several weighty tomes under his belt&mdash;<a href = "http://cpcarey.com/site/tag/gods-of-opar/" target = "_blank">go buy them</a>. Whether it's editing a massive mess of a document or working on his next literary behemoth, Chris proves the results of building your house one brick at a time. How such a reliable, determined professional wound up editing our nerd-books has always slightly baffled me, but much of Paizo's editorial quality and consistency stems directly from his red pen.</p>

<p><b>Cosmo Eisele</b>: Cosmo deserves less blame than he accepts... but only a little. That's probably just part of being legitimately one of the nicest chaps at Paizo. He's traveling the world much more these days, so if you get the chance to meet up with him, buy him a drink&mdash;he gets more sass than he deserves.</p>

<p><b>Crystal Frasier</b>: I don't really believe in talent. There's failure, there's determination, there's improvement, there's even inborn advantage, but there aren't really magical gifts. And I refuse to factor Crystal Frasier into that algebra. You could say she's a double threat, or a triple threat, but then you keep counting and once you get to calling people septuple or octuple threats you start sounding silly. Crystal's a great writer, an incredible artist, a skilled graphic designer, a killer cartographer, an adept editor, a riveting storyteller, a terrifying bare-knuckle scrapper, and so forth. She can pretty much do it all&mdash;and largely has. At some point, the rest of us are largely around just because it'd be too time consuming for her to handle absolutely everything by herself. And none of this comports with my understanding of how creatives learn and improve over time. So, the secret is that maybe some people do have magical gifts. That's the only way Crystal Frasier makes any sense.</p>

<p><b>Dan Tharp</b>: Dan's actually a mimic. I would have said doppleganger, but he's largely a communications dude, so something with a big mouth seemed more suiting. Paizo's been around for a long time and many folks have been there forever. I wouldn't call it unfriendly, but the ruts and grooves, the routines and methods are ground in both procedurally and socially. It can be daunting coming in, like attending a new school in a town you didn't grow up in. But somehow Dan sauntered in and convinced everybody he's been there the whole time. He's got an easy confidence, an "I can do that!" attitude, and that sort of expressive enthusiasm that both gamers and game makers love. A lot of folks have a lot of opinions about what Paizo's Outreach Coordinator should and could do, so we're lucky to have found a shapeshifter up to doing it and being it all!</p>

<p><b>Dean Ludwig, Don Hayes, Erik Keith, & Gary Teter</b>: The legend goes that Paizo.com was birthed amid sparks, three scotch-taped Magnavox Odyssey consoles, and 36 feet of string cheese. I can't speak much toward legends, but there's often a hint of hidden truth (perhaps not in this case, but often). In any case, the tech team has worked wonders under the cover of code to assure that Paizo can do all the varied things the company needs to do and then some and then some again. Few can say how many countless nights and weekends the team's put in, but I'm certain that without them we'd all be filling out subscription renewal cards to this day.</p>

<p><b>Erik Mona</b>: Here's a good one: You think you know roleplaying games. You don't. Erik Mona knows roleplaying games. The history, the characters, the origins, the inspirations, the characters, the players, the pedigrees, the big successes, the dismal failures, the dark secrets. Erik hasn't just stumbled across this info, he's collected it&mdash;he's horded it. He knows more than he could ever tell you, and he knows the roots and shadowy grit beneath that. The game industry and everything in its orbit has been his game, his obsession, for a long time. And no one plays a game for that long without getting damn good at it. As a result, though, Erik's path has lead him down a businessmanly road, a route upon that's made him more of a behind-the-scenes player than a name you see on lots of covers these days&mdash;with the exception of <a href = "/products/btpy9oco?Pathfinder-Worldscape-1">Pathfinder Worldscape</a>, which is now officially required reading. In my opinion, though, gaming could use a few more <em>Greyhawk Gazetteers</em> and <em>Mutants & Masterminds: Crooks</em>. It could certainly use a Nex book. Probably some old-school trap riddled adventures, too. Just sayin'.</p>

<p>Erik's been my boss for a long time. We've worked well together and have pulled off some pretty cool stunts. I could chalk up this long, successful partnership to shared tastes and work ethics, but I know there's a secret, a deceptively simple mantra Erik ingrains in everyone on his crew: Do your job, Be exceptional, Wear shoes. Words to live, to work, and to manage by that have had a profound impact on my life. Over the years, Erik's been a ready collaborator, an open-minded listener, a font of fascinating stories, and a good friend, and even though I won't be working at Paizo next week, I don't expect any of those things to change.</p>

<p><b>James Jacobs</b>: One of my favorite stories about starting at Paizo is that in 2003 I moved 3,000 miles from Baltimore, Maryland to Renton, Washington... and blindly into the apartment next door to James Jacobs. For much of my time living in Washington, my front door has been within 200 steps of James's (and often far closer). For more of that time, James's desk has been within 20 steps of mine (and often far closer). James is a fire hose of cool stuff, whether it's these hundred games you have to play or these thousand movies you need to see. It's impossible for that sort of tsunami to not influence an assistant editor in his twenties, which is likely partially why we've worked so well together for so long&mdash;whether collaborating on adventures for <em>Dungeon</em>, sculpting the Pathfinder Adventure Path series, building corners of the Pathfinder world, or tinkering with a thousand other projects. James also quickly learned that "carpool buddy" and "confessor" mean pretty much the same thing to me. As a result, he knows where more of the skeletons are buried than anyone else. That, time, proximity, and shared dementia make him a friend, a brother, and a man too dangerous to antagonize. Therefore, it is in my best interest to keep James's secrets well guarded.</p>

<div class = "blurb360"><a href = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/Carbuncle.jpg"><img src = "//static3.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/Carbuncle_360.jpeg"></a></div>

<p><b>James L. Sutter</b>: Despite all evidence to the contrary, Sutter and I are, in fact, two different people. Shocking, but true. The root of the confusion seems to be that we both have brownish hair and wear the same size jeans. We've also collaborated on one or two projects, from <a href = "/threads/rzs2gex6?Shut-In">"Shut In"</a> in <em>Dungeon</em> #128 (2005) to, well, today&mdash;you're all picking up <a href = "/products/btpy9sgl?Pathfinder-Runescars-1">Pathfinder Runescars</a>, right?! I coached Sutter through his first adventure, Sutter coached me through my first novel, and we both endlessly tell the other that all his ideas are stupid. But when either of us say that, the other knows it's not just being mean, it's also being honest. We've both had more than our share of missteps on the road to the next big or new or fun thing and we've been upfront with each other about those blunders. When I've mucked something up, I tell Sutter it didn't work. When Sutter mucks something up, he tells me not to do that. We've been climbing over each other's corpses for a long time. Undoubtedly I wouldn't be anywhere near where I am today, or have done half of what I've done, without Sutter's advice, example, edits, and encouragement. But for @#$%'s sake, people, he's got a beard! We don't look anything alike!</p>

<p><b>Jason Bulmahn</b>: Sometimes, after spending a decade gaslighting a man, you have regrets. In the best cases, though, you look back, satisfied at a job well done. Efforts proceeded in thorough, themed campaigns&mdash;spiders, tokkens, ponies, letter transposition, tokkens 2, tokkens 3 (there were clearly favorites). Jason brought this harassment on himself in two ways. First, he gift-wrapped my cube in 2006 (there are probably pictures). Second, he does everything "big." He designs big games, he makes big books, he draws big maps, and he has big reactions. Jason never stopped being an architect; he's always been addicted to scale. Go big or go home is pretty much the Bulmahn motto&mdash;perhaps followed closely by "the ends justify the means." He's certainly got a track record with far more gigantic successes than colossal failures, which I'm certain spurs him to do more ever bigger. I can't wait to see what gargantuan he's working on next, and am relatively certain that I haven't been swept up in his madness for the last time. But what's the secret? Well, there's sort of a lot here, but if you want something concrete: we legally changed the spelling of Jason's last name in 2008.</p>

<p><b>Jason Keeley</b>: Someday you'll all know Jason Keeley as the world's most effective method ad-lib actor. I'm not sure that he's actually employed at Paizo, but the bit's been running for so long that it hardly matters now. "Yes, and..." is pretty much in Jason's blood.</p>

<p>"Jason, you're an editor," it started.<br />
"Yes, and..." he said.<br />
"Now you're doing development, too."<br />
"Yes, and..."<br />
"Now you're one of the leads on Starfinder."<br />
"Yes, and..."</p>

<p>I can't predict where this is all going, but every step of the way Jason's jumped right in, rolled with things, and done an exemplary (and utterly believable) job. I look forward to his inevitable design and management performances. Though it's going to be an awkward day when he finally calls "scene" and no one's knows what he's talking about. You can check out Jason's previous performances, like <em>Fortune's Fool</em> at <a href = "https://www.facebook.com/pantheonpress/" target = "_blank">Pantheon Press</a>.</p>

<p><b>Jeff Alvarez</b>: Jeff keeps a secret few folks at Paizo know: Paizo isn't a company, it's a train. There are big mechanical parts, tons of fuel, numerous cars, and track&mdash;endless track. For anything to work, it's all got to work together&mdash;maybe not perfectly, but as well as possible. Jeff is Mr. Make-It-Happen, whether that's helping to plot a route or being part of the team laying track ahead of the locomotive. He's never been too good to help pack a crate or too careless not to consider how a strategy might affect every part of the machine. He also knows that sometimes the crew just needs to blow off steam, and if that's going happen, there better be good food and even better drink. It's been said that Jeff's in charge of everything "that's real" at Paizo. That's one hell of a responsibility, and it can surely be a loud, dirty, and relentless a job. But one thing's for sure, the Paizo engine would have skipped the tracks a long time ago without him.</p>

<p><b>Jenny Bendel</b>: You will never have more friends than Jenny Bendel. Every time I've ever been anywhere with Jenny she's had to step away to greet some new-coming mover-and-shaker, gaming legend, '90s rock icon, or other charmer. It's easy to see why, though, as Jenny's one of the most easily enthusiastic people I've ever had the pleasure of knowing. She also has a second sense for knowing "the place to be," which leads her on all manner of adventures. Unfortunately, I don't get to see Jenny often, but when she's in town, she always brings the best stories.</p>

<p><b>Jessica Price</b>: Here's a secret for those of you who haven't been paying attention: Jessica Price does not want to hear about your character. Jessica's the smartest person in a room full of people used to being the smartest person in the room. She doesn't care how it's always been done, she doesn't care about momentum or tradition, she doesn't care about well enough, she cares about what works, how it could work better, and how to build things cooler than what's come before. It might not be easy and some tables might need to be flipped, but it'll be worth it in the end. Jessica has challenged me on my ideas and my methods, she's criticized my calls, she's pointed out my screw-ups, she's slammed my office door&mdash;and I can't thank her enough. I'm no genius, but if there's one thing I know is worth its weight is gold, it's a smart critic (and woe betide those who dismiss cagey critics). Jessica has walked me through basic concepts for the fiftieth time, she's dealt with important things I can't give my full attention, she's coached me through handling public gaffs, and she's strategized how to do better the next time. She's committed enough to have written thousands of words of cover copy and solicitation text, able enough to have developed whole hardcover books, and invested enough to spend her own time developing the Pathfinder world (you've all picked up <a href = "products/btpy9qib"><em>Qadira</em></a>, right?!). And she's done all this, while getting Paizo's products more consistently on schedule than ever before. Jessica has been a collaborator, a noble friend, and my fearless champion. I can't thank her enough for all that she's done&mdash;that which I know and that which I'll never know. But a word to the wise: don't waste Jessica's time with characters you've been playing for thirty years. Instead, share what cool ideas you have for the new thing you're trying tomorrow (and even then, keep it short).</p>

<p><b>Joe Pasini</b>: I'm undecided here, as he and I haven't worked together for terribly long, but I'm pretty convinced that Joe's either a truth wizard or the Platonic spirit of editorship. Joe can make anything, no matter how ludicrous, sound perfectly earnest&mdash;even sensible. I chalk this up to either weird powers of manipulation, or his fundamental mastery of an editor's ability to bring even the most bizarre concepts to linguistic heel. I'm leaning toward truth wizard, though&mdash;especially after I found myself thanking him and Jason Keeley for letting me be a guest on a podcast they don't have. (Yet?)</p>

<p><b>John Compton</b>: If you know when and how to look, you'll realize that John Compton is the reincarnation of Roman Emperor Antoninus Augustus Pius. It's most obvious in the Pathfinder Society room at Gen Con&mdash;the combination of public speaking, raised platforms, and scurrying governors is something of a give away. John has his predecessor's flair for empire building, for management on a massive scale, for oratory, for diplomacy, and for decisive justice. Where most would crack under the pressure of so many responsibilities, John weathers it all with the marble facade equal to his forebearer's sculptures. Many have expected great things from John, and all of them had their expectations exceeded. John is also an amazing game designer, adventure crafter, and perhaps Paizo's best Game Master, but unfortunately comparison of these virtues to Emperor Antoninus Pius is beyond my scholarship. In short, hail Caesar, long may he reign.</p>

<p><b>John Parrish</b>: John comes from a much realer, more sensible world than most folks at Paizo are accustomed to or wholly comfortable with. As a reprehensive of the real, John exudes competency, efficiently, and trustworthiness. If John says something's the case, I'm confident it's the case, and no amount of flailing is going to change the matter. There's real comfort to that in an industry where so much is made up and rules exist to be bent. Despite all this, John wears his adventurous streak like an Iron Maiden tie tack and his rare jokes are a characteristically reliable vein of comedy gold. Paizo couldn't be luckier to have him&mdash;wherever he's from.</p>

<p><b>Judy Bauer</b>: You do not mess with Judy Bauer. Judy Bauer's desk is decorated in things made from thread she wove herself and carrion. Judy Bauer once stabbed a god in the eye with a hypodermic needle because she was curious about science. Judy Bauer is never not wearing her poker face. Judy is one of the world's hyper-competents, and the rest of us rely on good people like her to accomplish absolutely anything at all. You&mdash;wise soul that you are&mdash;do not mess with Judy Bauer. And neither do I. As such, Judy's secrets remain her own.</p>

<p><b>Laura Carey, Mika Hawkins, Heather Payne, Jeff Strand, & Kevin Underwood</b>: Are the names of the oft-referenced cave raptors that stalk the warehouse. They are the second most affable contingent of Paizo staffers, but the most thoroughly and elaborately armed. Their smiles prove they have sharp teeth and know that soft-skinned creatives keep to their carpet-covered places. They're known for their quick, sturdy caliber of sass and for accomplishing the impossible month after month. They're certainly not known for any unidentifiable packing-tape mummies above the downstairs kitchen.</p>

<p><b>Linda Zayas-Palmer</b>: You wouldn't guess it from her quick grin or unabashed love of leshies, but beneath that "I'd leave her alone with my kids" exterior, Linda is made of knives. Not so much the stabbing kind of knives, more the "let's put googley eyes on this and give it a squeaky voice" sort of knives. But, you know, still knives. Linda's got a sharp mind for systems and readily sees how every little thing works. If she's not designing her own bizarrely elegant games already, I expect she will be very soon.</p>

<div class="blurbCenter"><a href="/image/content/Blog/PZO1127-Nosoi.jpg"><img src="/image/content/Blog/PZO1127-Nosoi_500.jpeg"></a></div>

<p><b>Lisa Stevens</b>: Lisa's seen it all, done it all, and is always up for doing it all again. That's probably why every year her "Auntie Lisa's Story Hour" gets just a little bit longer. By 2030 you can look forward to a fifth day of PaizoCon composed entirely of that event. Despite her incredible experience, though, Lisa's never let "been there, done that" or "know-it-all-ism" set in. She's cultivated a beautiful, diverse asylum at Paizo, and her willingness to listen and try things new ways are undoubtedly secrets behind her company's success. I'm far from unique in this regard, but I wouldn't be where I am today without Lisa's hard work, her boundless enthusiasm for games, and her eye for good people. For all that, I'm beyond grateful.</p>

<p><b>Lissa Guillet</b>: While I'm not sure of the specifics, Lissa did something and now computers fear her. I've tested this on multiple occasions. No sooner does Lissa walk into a room than rowdy technology gets back in line. For now she's largely using her leverage for good. For now.</p>

<p><b>Logan Bonner</b>: Logan is precision instrument&mdash;like a scalpel or a really big scalpel. Amid teams prone to flights of fancy, to overelaboration, to using a thousand words where ten would do, Logan excels at getting to the meat of the matter and to excising the fat. He's a veteran game maker, so a lot of that is simply second nature at this point. But if you look at what he designs, you'll find a lot of him in the work&mdash;systems with complex subtlety that get the job done and have the potential to be a hell of a lot of fun.</p>

<p><b>Mark Moreland</b>: Mark's also a collector and chronicler&mdash;and that makes him dangerous. He likes knowing the details, putting them in order, and figuring out the secrets. Mark's revealed countless holes in supposedly foolproof plots over the years and is more than willing to share his mind. He's like a favorite cousin who has a knack for pissing off your parents. I jokingly tell Mark to shut up with some frequency, but I don't know that I've ever told him he's wrong. Too often we can't see the specifics of the pictures we paint, but Mark's got a damn keen eye for details.</p>

<p><b>Mark Seifter</b>: Seifter is radiation. Not, like, the bad kind, but the sort of sci-fi radiation that makes things grow in brilliantly unpredictable ways. Rather than growing plants or Hulks, though, Mark grows intricate rules systems, transforming the mundane into marvels. Fortunately, this boundless energy has been a boon to those in need, from fellow designers to questioning forum posters. Whether in brainstorms or on the convention floor, Mark's vigor is unignorable and promises a future vibrant with mighty things.</p>

<p><b>Mike Kenway</b>: Kenway thinks I've been ignoring his emails, IMs, and sticky notes all this time as a joke. The secret is that I haven't been. I've been ignoring them for real. I'll miss filling your chair cushions with woodlice, Kenway&mdash;that's the god's honest truth.</p>

<p><b>Owen KC Stephens</b>: Owen got his job by doing solid design work and being a damn nice guy. He then proved himself to have an utterly insufferable combination of intelligence, outspokenness, experience, and relentlessness that's led him to positively reshape every project he's been a part of. Owen plays the guru well, but he's most at home in the thick of things, testing, debating, and redesigning. He's nothing short of a powerhouse. And then we put him in the same room with Rob McCreary and from their debates a secret source of endless&mdash;but largely unmarketable&mdash;energy was achieved.</p>

<p><b>Pierce Watters</b>: More trivia than a secret: You're probably only one step removed from personally knowing somebody who personally knows Pierce Watters. Pierce knows everybody, has been everywhere, has done everything, and is happy to tell you why that thing is either a fantastic idea or a fantastically horrible idea. If there ever is or ever was a publishing and gaming equivalent of gonzo journalism, Pierce would be one of the greats. I haven't always grokked everything Pierce has told me stories about, but I've always appreciated being invited along for the ride.</p>

<p><b>Rick Kunz</b>: Rick Kunz is an intellect ouroboros. Rick's one of those guys who can look at a system, analyze it, and find the best solution in 5 minutes. If there's something he doesn't know, he'll teach himself. If there's information someone else has, he'll get it out of them and iterate something better. If there's a problem that needs fixing, he'll find a solution. Rick's one of those guys who can do or could do anything... and who also calls himself a dumb guy. Which leads me to believe that he either has a low opinion of his brilliance or he's smart enough to know the value of being underestimated. A cagey enigma, that one, but well worth keeping an eye on.</p>

<p><b>Robert G. McCreary</b>: Rob hasn't aged a day since washing up on the shore near Hampton amid the wreckage of the USS Cumberland. In the years since, he's eluded a lucrative, globetrotting career as a hand model to become the world's most deliberate RPG adventure developer. Rob is host to multitudes, which means he can argue anything from any angle. It also gives him a breadth of perspective that makes him one of the best character creators and editors in the biz.</p>

<p><b>Sara Marie</b>: In a cynical world of customers who are "always"&mdash;audible eyeroll&mdash;"right" and companies that put patrons first(-ish), it's hard to consider standards of customer service much more than marketing ploys. But that's not the case for Sara Marie. Giving everybody a fair shake, bending over backward to address an issue, and working long hours to organize a fan-focused show like PaizoCon, they're all something akin to duty for her. That's one of the most difficult to believe secrets I've written today: that for Sara Marie, doing right by Paizo's customers isn't a gimmick, it's the honest truth.</p>

<p><b>Sarah Robinson</b>: Sarah has like thirty super powers. The greatest, though, is that she can walk into a restaurant, glance at a menu, and <em>instantly</em> know the best thing on it. (If you ever go get food with Sarah, order what she's having.) She can also create art and laid-out pages by force of will, but activating it usually comes at a price in developer skins. The economics here get tricky. Regardless, Sarah's one of the top three secrets to Paizo's success. If you've ever picked up a Pathfinder or Starfinder book, leafed through, and said "wow" within the first minute, it's probably because of her.</p>

<p><b>Sharaya Copas, Katina Davis, Diego Valdez, & Scott Keim</b>: Aside from being several of the champions that keep Paizo running from day to day, our Customer Service team, Sharaya, Katina, and Diego, and Data Entry Clerk Scott Keim are some of the company's best. They're always beyond friendly and are endlessly willing&mdash;even eager&mdash;to pitch in, to playtest a game, and to give honest feedback. Those of us in editorial might not get to interact with them as often, but some of Paizo's most major products would be entirely different without their efforts and insight.</p>

<p><b>Sonja Morris</b>: Sonja's captain of Team Bombproof. Any project or in-process fire can land on her desk and everyone will be confident that she'll handle it. It's not always glamorous, but it's appreciated far more than people say. Add to that Sonja's ability to work with anyone on anything, her years of experience, and her quiet dark streak, and you've got the makings of one of Paizo's true superstars. I'll miss our cyclical rounds of "What do you need? No, what do you need?"</p>

<p><b>Stephen Radney-MacFarland</b>: Perhaps not a huge secret, but Stephen has one of the best s@#%-sniffers in the business. He's a fantastic critic, and doesn't care about your intention or your opinion. In the aftermath of a project, there's no disguising his judgments. Before that, though, while there's work to be done, Stephen's one of the best project wranglers and design sculptors what there is. You don't want collaborators who are only going to be half-enthused about your work, and Stephen's not interested in half measures. If it's good, it's done. If it's bad, he'll help you fix it... maybe. It's an uncomplicated arrangement, but it's one that's led me to trust Stephen's opinion more than most.</p>

<p><b>Tonya Woldridge</b>: Many folks know Tonya has a military background&mdash;most Venture-Officers have firsthand experience with her knack for organization. No one ever ask what century's military her experience is with, though. An expert time traveler, Tonya has clear access to a repository of excess hours. There's no other explanation for how she attends to all manner of Organized Play business at all hours of the day and night, weekdays and weekends, time zones be damned. Organized Play programs of the past, present, and future has never been in more able hands. Now if only she'd share her chronomasterful ways.</p>

<p><b>Vic Wertz</b>: If it's a job at Paizo, Vic's probably done it. He's edited books, he's designed games, he's moderated the forums, he's architected the website, he's pitched projects, he's set strategy, he's done it all and has schemes for what's come next. Vic has as keen sense of the Paizo that Paizo could be and is eager to get there. So, if helping to edit an article or move a box full of board games is the next hurdle in the company's path, he's happy to help clear it. The same goes for Paizo's entire executive team, but with Vic there's always a matter-of-factness, a "this is happening" attitude that makes it clear no hurdle's insurmountable.</p>

<p><b>Will Chase</b>: You're not going to impress Will Chase. Will has this seen-it-all, done-it-all air. On top of that, dude manages a warehouse full of games and has the keys to a forklift with a Cthulhu bumper sticker. He doesn't wow easy. There's a difference between people who get things done and people with a "let's not make this a problem" attitude. It's the difference between knowing the way to a place, but also knowing the back roads. Will knows all the roads, so it's probably in your best interest to buy him a drink.</p>

<p>And that about does it. While it probably doesn't forestall tomorrow's abuse, at the very least it should leave the scales karmically even.</p>

<p>Even though I won't be at Paizo day to day anymore, it's not like I'm frickin' dying. I'll certainly still be around on the boards and likely in print every now and then. You can also keep up with my schemes in all the places I usually haunt&mdash;most obviously on <a href = "https://twitter.com/FWesSchneider" target = "_blank">Twitter</a> and <a href = "http://wesschneider.tumblr.com/" target = "_blank">Tumblr</a>, but also on <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMAFY0UeTw-Zu8M1QHuUP_Q" target = "_blank">YouTube</a> and <a href = "https://www.patreon.com/WesSchneider" target = "_blank">Patreon</a>, and <a href = "https://www.twitch.tv/wesschneider" target = "_blank">Sundays at 3:00 PST on Twitch</a>. Feel free to give me a follow wherever your social stuff takes you.</p>

<p>So that's it for now. Thanks again to everyone at Paizo, to all the incredible Paizo authors and artists, and to those in the wider Paizo community for what's been an amazing ride. I couldn't be more awestruck by all your incredible work or more excited for what's to come.</p>

<p>Keep up all the awesome.</p>

<p>~W</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline">Gen Con 50 Events</h1>

<p class="date">Wednesday, May 17, 2017</p>

<div itemprop="articlebody">

<p itemprop="description">Last week, I previewed some of the offerings in store for <a href = "/paizocon">PaizoCon 2017</a> attendees. The lottery ran and we are in the open event selection period until next Monday. If you have May 26-29 free and want to travel to beautiful Seattle, you can still pick up a badge in-person at the PaizoCon Convention store.</p>

<p>While most of our focus is on PaizoCon, the Gen Con catalog of events went live on their website last Sunday. Attendees may browse the offerings and compile wish lists in preparation for ticket sales starting May 28. With so many games and events, I wanted to highlight some of the key Paizo offerings.</p>

<h2>Starfinder Society</h2>

<p><a href = "/starfinder">Starfinder</a> is the buzzword for Gen Con, and the Sagamore Ballroom will buzz with sounds of the future all weekend. Events kick off with the <em>Starfinder Quest: Into the Unknown</em>. While we are running free quests throughout the convention, both in the Exhibition Hall and the Sagamore Ballroom, participation entails waiting in line, playing one of the six offerings, then returning to the line. During the first two slots of the convention, Thursday 8:00 AM-1:00 PM and 2:00 PM-7:00 PM, we offer a ticket version of the Quests, which eliminates the waiting in line and gives attendees the chance to finish the entire quest series in one sitting. These quests utilize 1st level pregenerated characters available onsite.</p>

<p>Thursday evening is the premier of the <em>Starfinder Society Special #1-00: Claim to Salvation</em>. This event uses 4th level versions of the Starfinder iconic characters, which James Sutter and the Starfinder team is currently previewing Friday's on this blog. The in-world Starfinder Society needs firepower to complete a mission and turn to the iconics to provide assistance. After Thursday evening's launch, the Gen Con schedule includes tables of this event most slots.</p>

<p>The schedule is set up so that an attendee may play Starfinder all Thursday with pregenerated characters, pick up a copy of the <em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em> from the Paizo booth in the Exhibition Hall, then make their own character and return Friday ready to play Starfinder Society Scenarios <em>#1-01: The Commencement, #1-02: Fugitive on the Red Planet</em>, and <em>#1-03: Yesteryear's Truth</em>. Of these offerings, #1-01 is a replayable scenario and #1-02 and #1-03 are for 1st to 4th level characters. Product pages are not yet available on paizo.com, but will be posted soon.</p>

<h2>Pathfinder Society</h2>

<p>If Starfinder isn't your focus, there are plenty of Pathfinder Society offerings. Starting with <em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-07: From the Tome of Righteous Repose</em>, we offer every subsequent Season 8 scenario, including one table most sessions of <em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-25: Unleashing the Untouchable</em> a scenario for level 12-15 characters. We also have a few older scenarios, such as <em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #01: Silent Tide</em> and <em>#7-99: Through Maelstrom Rift</em></p>

<p>Friday night is the debut of the Season 9 multi-table interactive special, <em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #9-00: Assault on Absalom</em>. This event takes over the Sagamore, with 160 tables of the Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild and 20 tables of the Pathfinder Adventure Card Guild playing the same scenario simultaneously. The Gen Con event system lists tickets for this event by sub-tier, so there are five different roleplaying event entries for the same event. We will monitor ticket sales and adjust the number of tables in each sub-tier as necessary, but at the event players will be required to play a character in the sub-tier for which they hold a ticket. As a note, 9th level is not listed for sale. This is the gap level and players of 9th level characters may purchase tickets for tier 7-8 or tier 10-11. We will have copies of the pregenerated iconic characters available for player use. The pregenerated characters only go to level 7, so there are no iconic pregenerated characters available for subtier 10-11. The Season 9 scenario offerings start Saturday morning at 8:00 AM. As with prior years, the first three scenarios of the season are on offer. We round out our special event offerings with the new multi-table modular special, <em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-99: The Solstice Scar</em>, scheduled for Saturday evening from 8:00 PM-1:00 AM.</p>

<p>The Adventure Card Guild has a full stock of events spanning all seasons of organized play, including Season of the Shackles, Season of the Righteous, and Season of the Runelords, Season of Plundered Tombs. We are putting final touches on the next season and hope to announce more information soon. As well as seasonal play and participating in the aforementioned <em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #9-00: Assault on Absalom</em>, Gen Con sees a return of the Open Tournament. Starting Thursday with qualifying rounds, the tournament event spans the entire convention, with finals on Sunday at noon. Gather your teammates and come reign victorious!</p>

<p>Pathfinder Society Academy is back this year, bigger and better than ever. Aimed at providing youth ages 6-17 a positive gaming experience, we set aside space specifically for them and their families. Programming includes the three modules of lessons: Beginner, Advanced, and Transitions, which introduce the game from the ground up and prepare the players for running characters in the Pathfinder Society, as well as Pathfinder Society Scenarios selected from prior season's catalogs. Adults are welcome at Pathfinder Society Academy tables as long as they accompany a youth. For their safety and enjoyment, children ages 6-12 must have a parent who remains at the Pathfinder Society Academy area. Youth ages 13-15 must have a parent in the Sagamore Ballroom and youth aged 16-17 need a way to contact a parent onsite in case of emergency.</p>

<p>If playing games doesn't pique your interest, consider attending one of the Paizo panels. The first seminar starts Thursday at 11:00 AM and run through Sunday at noon. Topics include returning favorites like Ask the Paizo GMs, Writing for Paizo, Pathfinder Rules Q&A, and Aunty Lisa's Story Hour. New offerings this year include Making your First Starfinder Character, Starfinder Rules Design Workshop, Secrets of the Pact Worlds, and Starfinder Adventure Path Q&A. Come learn all the secrets of your favorite games!</p>

<p>Whew! I knew we offered quite a few activities at Gen Con, but it wasn't until I was trying to select which to highlight in this blog that I realized how great programming is available. I couldn't touch on everything, so I urge you to check out <a href = "https://www.gencon.com/event_finder" target = "_blank">the Gen Con catalog</a> and search keyword Paizo.</p>

<p>Over the past couple of weeks, we had some changes in Sagamore Ballroom leadership. Jon Cary, a stalwart presence for many years, stepped back from the role and Bob Jonquet is spearheading efforts. We added Walter Sheppard to the team to make up for Jon's departure. Rounding out the executive team is Lucas Servideo and Todd Morgan. Thank you to Jon for his many years spent planning and executing Pathfinder Society events at Gen Con. Enjoy seeing the show this year!</p>

<p>For those whose travel plans are undecided, we still need GM assistance, including a handful of Tier 1 positions. The team and I spent the past weeks contacting those that already signed up and are working on scheduling those individuals for events. You should have schedule information before ticket sales go live on the 28th. Watch your inbox for correspondence. If you are interested in GMing at the event, complete the <a href = "https://goo.gl/forms/nChfPO5oTNesZf422" target = "_blank">questionnaire</a> and we will be in contact shortly.</p>

<p>Also for GMs, Origins Game Fair is also still looking for individuals to fill some slots at the convention held June 14 to 19 in Columbus, Ohio. Interested volunteers should sign up by sending Venture-Captain Michael McNerney an email at ohiopfs@gmail.com.</p>

<p>I look forward to seeing many of you at PaizoCon in just over a week. If you're attending, please stop by the Grand Ballroom and say hi! Just remember, there are few strangers in gaming, but many friends you haven't met yet!</p>

<p>Until next time&mdash;Explore, Report, Cooperate!</p>

<p class="date">Monday, May 15, 2017</p>

<div itemprop="articlebody">

<p><i>The countdown to <a href = "/starfinder">Starfinder</a> is on! We're highlighting the iconic characters and core classes that appear throughout the pages and covers the Starfinder line. Today we meet Keskodai, the iconic mystic!</i></p>

<p><i>Illustration by Remko Troost</i></p></div>

<p itemprop="description">For those inducted into the faith of Pharasma, the Lady of Graves, death is not an ending, but a doorway: an entry into a new existence and way of being. The shirren Keskodai understands this transition well, and greets it with the joyful reverence it deserves&mdash;an outlook that's not always comforting to the patients in his medical bay.</p>

<p>Keskodai grew up in the burning deserts of Fullbright, the side of tidally locked Verces that's always turned toward the sun. Though cosmopolitan, his hometown of Takoris was primarily shirren, having been an early satellite settlement of the original shirren colony on that world. The child of a priest of Hylax, the Forever Queen, Keskodai grew up steeped in the values of friendship and diplomacy, and felt a deep connection to the divine, yet chafed at the idea of serving the same god as his parent. Exactly which god he'd serve instead remained unclear, until the coming of the Gray Shakes.</p>

<p>Believed to be the result of a biotech experiment gone wrong at the local university, the plague called the Gray Shakes burned through the city like a wildfire, turning shirrens' chitin gray, rotting off their antennae, and eating away at their telepathy and motor function, leaving them awake but unable to communicate until they finally expired. In the weeks it took the local government to find a cure, thirty percent of the city's shirren population died.</p>

<p>In the midst of this horror, a young Keskodai first encountered priests of Pharasma, black-robed beings of all different races who'd come at news of the plague. Somberly, the Pharasmins walked among the afflicted, offering magical healing where they could and comfort to those too far gone, whispering to them of the Cycle of Souls and the new worlds that awaited them. The beauty of their ministry moved Keskodai, and he quickly joined their hospice work, leaving home to study at a temple in the Ring of Nations once the plague was safely contained.</p>

<p>After years as an initiate, Keskodai returned home a full priest of Lady of Graves, ready to tend to his people. He quickly fell in love with two members of his congregation, a female-host couple, and the three soon joined arms in marriage. Yet as much as he loved his community and his partners, a part of him remained unsatisfied. That part of every shirren that thrills at choice and decision-making began to wonder: Had he made the right choice in coming home? In choosing a life so similar to his parent? How could he know if he wanted this when there was still so much out there that he'd never experienced? The desire to explore continued to grow, until at last, after the birth of their first son, he and his partners sat down and made a plan. He would leave and see the galaxy, taking their child with him to expose him to the same new experiences. Once the child was old enough to leave his cradle-jar, Keskodai would decide whether he'd seen enough to return in good conscience, in which case both of them be welcomed with open arms. If not, the child would return alone.</p>

<p>In his effort to see as many worlds as possible, Keskodai took to signing on with freelance adventurers and starship crews, particularly those headed out beyond the edges of the solar system. While quite capable in combat, he prefers to act as the ship's medic, trusting that his mercenary companions will give him plenty of opportunities to employ his goddess-granted magic in patching up the broken or blessing them on their journey into the Great Beyond. The cheerful manner in which he talks about death often initially disturbs those under his care, yet anyone who spends much time with the shirren quickly learns that his even-keeled, fatalistic approach to life and death doesn't make him cavalier about it: for him, to give less than his best effort in healing his friends would be to risk them dying before their appointed time&mdash;a loss for him, and a grave failure in his duty to his goddess.</p>

<p>As with many shirren, Keskodai is a team player, always ready to throw in to help others, and a social butterfly who loves meeting new people. A crewmate once called him "the galaxy's friendliest death priest," and he wears the badge with pride. Though quite fond of option bars and other artificial means of stimulating his choice centers, he's careful not to let himself overindulge... usually. More often he satisfies his need for independence by customizing his gear&mdash;though he doesn't consider himself vain, Keskodai is intensely proud of the aesthetics of his gear, his collection of trophies, and his mustache (which he thinks lends him an air of gravitas). His greatest pride, however, is his son Chkoresk, still in his larval stage. Like many shirren parents, Keskodai constantly carries Chkoresk&mdash;affectionately nicknamed "Chk Chk"&mdash;around in a heavily fortified cradle-jar designed to let Chk Chk learn about the world from relative safety. While Chk Chk isn't old enough to speak yet, his telepathy only good enough to grant brief blasts of childlike emotion, Keskodai holds conversations with him regularly, with Chk Chk tapping on the glass to communicate his answers.</p>

<p>Though Keskodai is generally as easygoing as he appears, he still has his demons. The Gray Shakes tragedy left him deeply distrustful of certain types of research and technology, and he's constantly torn between his faith in individual freedom and his desire to protect the community through heavy government regulation. Worse, he's come to love the life of a wanderer and the friends he's made along the way, and deeply fears the day when Chk Chk grows old enough to return home, and Keskodai has to choose whether to head back to Verces with him, or continue on alone.</p>

<p><i>Illustration by Remko Troost</i></p></div>

<p itemprop="description">As biomechanical entities, androids can theoretically live forever with the proper repairs. While some embrace this form of immortality, most androids live what they feel is a full life&mdash;usually around a hundred years&mdash;and then voluntarily instigate a process called renewal, in which the android's soul leaves its body, allowing a fresh android soul to inhabit it. Most people consider this a joyous occasion, metaphorically equivalent to the old android giving birth to a child, and understand that a post-renewal android is an entirely new person who just happens to inhabit the same body. Yet not all people are willing to honor this change or forgive past debts and slights, and such is the case with Iseph.</p>

<p>Iseph awoke in an abandoned storage facility on the machine world of Aballon, standing upright in a black-market renewal cr&egrave;che. Around them, the place was completely empty, save for a note and a pen left in the center of the concrete floor. Clearly hastily scrawled, the note read only: <i>Run. Hide. Retaliate. Beware the mark.</i> Next to the words was a drawing of a symbol&mdash;the same inexplicable design branded on Iseph's chest. Yet the biggest shock was when Iseph picked up the pen, as the note's writer had clearly intended&mdash;for the handwriting on the note matched Iseph's own.</p>

<p>Confused and disoriented, with only some basic downloaded knowledge of the world they'd just been born into, Iseph did as the note instructed, doing their best to disappear into Aballon's bustling android population. It was here that, among other things, they first met other androids and discovered that some identified with particular genders, though Iseph never felt any such personal connection. But the questions raised by the note continued to plague them. Who had worn their body before them? Who were they running from, and why? What was the mysterious symbol? Eventually, Iseph worked up the courage to begin making surreptitious inquiries into the planet's infosphere. All of these searches failed, yet in curious ways, as if the information was being actively scrubbed and redacted. Worse, Iseph began to get the sense of being watched, faces in the crowds that seemed strangely familiar. After a month of tentative forays into they city's silicon underworld, Iseph at last tracked down someone who claimed to recognize the mark, but who insisted on meeting in person at a nearby virus bar.</p>

<p>Iseph was almost to the tavern when it exploded in a massive fireball, the blast consuming an entire city block.</p>

<p>Thoroughly spooked, Iseph fled Aballon, taking passage on a ship to the Diaspora. Yet as they worked there, quickly finding themself a deft hand at piloting rock-hopper shuttles and mining tugs, Iseph's fear turned to anger. Wider Pact Worlds society proved far messier than Aballon's orderly machine culture, and Iseph was first confused and then disgusted by the prejudice and jealousy androids still encountered from some humans. They met android escapees from illegal colonies in the Vast, bearing blatant symbols of corporate ownership and scars from cruel disciplinary implants, and began to suspect what their own mark might say about their origins. Incensed, Iseph made contact with the Android Abolitionist Front, learning to fly more combat-oriented craft, to sneak through the shadows, and to put down the enemies of their people with ruthless efficiency. Under the AAF's guidance, Iseph became a black ops expert, until a disagreement with their handler over a messy job led them to go independent. Today, Iseph officially hires on with freelancer crews as an elite pilot specializing in dangerous transport or exploratory missions&mdash;and if those jobs sometimes require a little infiltration or a bullet from the shadows, well, that costs extra.</p>

<p>Though paranoia over being hunted by their mysterious enemy (as well as friends of former assassination targets) makes Iseph something of a loner, the android desperately craves companionship, and is fiercely loyal to those few who prove themselves trustworthy. As a result of their early days on Aballon and personal experience as an android in a largely biological society, Iseph questions or rejects many aspects of mainstream Pact Worlds culture, and enjoys exploring the countercultures on different worlds. Iseph believes the ends often justify the means, yet strives to only take on jobs that fit with their sense of morality. An initial focus on android rights has broadened into a tendency to identify with oppressed people and underdogs everywhere, no matter how alien, and to hate any form of slavery with a passion. While Iseph finds the most joy in flying any manner of ship or vehicle&mdash;usually too fast and recklessly for the comfort of their passengers&mdash;their infiltration abilities remain as sharp as they ever were, and the former assassin has no objections to pulling out their trusty sniper rifle again when the cause is just.</p>

<p>Next we have the Reclamation Knight, a medium uncommon. This miniature represents, hopefully, what your squire becomes after righting enough wrongs, and ending enough evil schemes. Love the detailing on the helmet, and the more ornate shield. This miniature is also based off of art from the Hell's Vengeance Adventure Path.</p>

<p>The Monstrous Skeleton is a large uncommon miniature. Because when having humanoid skeletons isn't enough, Paizo has you covered. Maul your player's characters to your heart's content with this bestial baddy, which is based off of art from the <a href = "/pathfinder/adventurePath/curseOfTheCrimsonThrone">Curse of the Crimson Throne Adventure Path</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, Shadowcount Sial is a medium rare miniature. This guy is a devout priest of Zon-Kuthon, one of our more cheery deities, as you can see from his joyful smile. Who wouldn't find serving The Midnight Lord a pleasure? This miniature is based off of art from the Curse of the Crimson Throne Adventure Path, and would work great as a priest, ranger, slayer, fighter, of whatever else you choose.</p>

  <p itemprop="description">We've been pretty vocal (I hope!) about one of the big changes to the rulebook line with the introduction of significant amounts of world content from Golarion in the upcoming <a href = "/products/btpy9sjo?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Adventurers-Guide"><em>Adventurer's Guide</em></a>. In fact, we've been relaxing the "world-neutral" element of the rulebook line for some time, as far back as <a href = "/products/btpy9egu?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Occult-Adventures"><em>Occult Adventures</em></a> where we abandoned the generic names for planes like the Boneyard and just used the Golarion/Great Beyond names in there. By lifting this self-imposed restriction, we're not fundamentally changing the type of content we're putting in rulebooks, but it does allow us to make our own rulebooks work even better with our own campaign setting.</p>

<p class="date">Thursday, May 11, 2017</p>

<div itemprop="articlebody">

<div class = "blurb180"><a href = "/products/btpy9sjo?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Adventurers-Guide"><img src = "//static1.paizo.com/image/product/catalog/PZO/PZO1138_180.jpeg"></a></div>

<p itemprop="description">We've been pretty vocal (I hope!) about one of the big changes to the rulebook line with the introduction of significant amounts of world content from Golarion in the upcoming <a href = "/products/btpy9sjo?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Adventurers-Guide"><em>Adventurer's Guide</em></a>. In fact, we've been relaxing the "world-neutral" element of the rulebook line for some time, as far back as <a href = "/products/btpy9egu?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Occult-Adventures"><em>Occult Adventures</em></a> where we abandoned the generic names for planes like the Boneyard and just used the Golarion/Great Beyond names in there. By lifting this self-imposed restriction, we're not fundamentally changing the type of content we're putting in rulebooks, but it does allow us to make our own rulebooks work even better with our own campaign setting.</p>

<p>Golarion is, after all, the setting used most overall by Pathfinder players. Gamemasters who run Pathfinder games set in other settings already had to decide how to incorporate flavor into their campaigns, changing names as needed, so whether or not they're changing the name of something called a "Red Mantis" or "Crimson Killer" or a "Scarlet Slayer" or whatever, by using the Golarion name we're making it more elegant and obvious how it fits into the vast majority of everything else Paizo publishes. But in order to standardize things for those who wish to reference names that remain our product identity, the Rules index for <em>Adventurer's Guide</em> lists alternate names as appropriate. So, if you want to use the Aldori swordlords in your game, you can either make a name up that fits your setting, use the "Aldori swordlord" in your setting, or go with our suggested "world neutral" name. So for example, the "Aldori defender" archetype becomes the "sword duelist defender", the "Aldori dueling sword" is merely the "dueling sword", and so on.</p>

<p>But there's another element in <em>Adventurer's Guide</em> that does something a little different, and this should specifically appeal to and intrigue fans of Golarion. When we were deciding what organizations to include in this book, there were a few that were no-brainers&mdash;Hellknights, Red Mantis, and the Pathfinder Society to name a few. We also knew we wanted to explore some of the concepts we've come up with more recently, like the Rivethun. But there was another category that was a bit trickier&mdash;organizations that we debuted and explored in our Adventure Paths. In many ways, these groups have become some of the most well-known organizations, because they've been the focus of entire campaigns. I'm talking about groups like the Council of Thieves, the Silver Ravens, the Cyphermages, and the Lantern Bearers&mdash;groups that were created for an Adventure Path first.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most famous of all these groups are the Gray Maidens&mdash;and in this case, they were absolutely created for an Adventure Path. Until the events of <a href = "/pathfinder/adventurePath/curseOfTheCrimsonThrone">Curse of the Crimson Throne</a> occur, there are no Gray Maidens at all in Golarion. But of all the groups in the setting, the look of the Gray Maiden has hit more eyes than ANY other group&hellip; because we put the iconic image of a Gray Maiden (created by the ever-talented Eva Widermann) on the back of the <em>Core Rulebook</em> itself.</p>

<p>So how can we present information about an organization that might well not even exist yet?</p>

<p>The answer was to make the assumption that the content of the <em>Adventurer's Guide</em> exists in a world after the events of those campaigns have played out. This allowed us to not only include groups like this in the book, but to explore how the events of their campaigns changed and shaped them. In the case of the Lantern Bearers in particular, this change is incredibly significant. In the <a href = "/pathfinder/advenutrePath/secondDarkness">Second Darkness Adventure Path</a>, the Lantern Bearers were a puppet group manipulated by a shadowy conspiracy. In <em>Adventurer's Guide</em>, the assumption is that the Lantern Bearers have come out from that shadow and are well on the way to recovering and redeeming themselves. They still seek to stem the evil of demon worship and threats from the Darklands, but do so in a way more aimed at redeeming lost sisters and brothers and saving them from themselves rather than via shadowy stealth ops or conspiracy tactics. This results in a far more interesting group with less cliche and more growth to build upon.</p>

<p>We've made every attempt to avoid spoiling adventure paths from which these groups came from, of course, with the goal of having this content serve almost like a movie trailer; you won't learn everything there is to know about the plot of the <a href = "/pathfinder/adventurePath/councilOfThieves">Council of Thieves Adventure Path</a> by reading the Council of Thieves chapter in <em>Adventurer's Guide</em>, but if we've done our job right, you'll be intrigued and perhaps want to play or run Council of Thieves as a result. The bulk of the new rules options for these groups are all brand new, so if you're a GM you can use the prestige classes and archetypes and items and spells and options in <em>Adventurer's Guide</em> to enhance an Adventure Path as you run it, perhaps even by giving out options to PCs as rewards for progressing through the story. You can also use them to bolster elements in an ongoing campaign, of course.</p>

</div>

<p>And that's it for this week! We've got a few more <em>Adventurer's Guide</em> previews coming in the weeks to come, so if there's an element of the book that folks are particularly eager in seeing a preview of, let me know in the comments below. In closing, I think I'm gonna show off the illustrations we've got in the book for three of the prestige classes inspired by groups that had their genesis in an Adventure Path&mdash;the Westcrown Devil, the Sanguine Angel, and the Argent Dramaturge!</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline">Meet Reepazo, Your New Buggy Buddy</h1>

<p class="date">Thursday, May 11, 2017</p>

<p itemprop = "description">You probably have guessed that we like goblin promo characters. To date, we've issued three of these rotters: <a href = "/products/btpy96ie?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Promo-Card-Ranzak">Ranzak</a>, <a href = "/products/btpy9fpr?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Promo-Card-Ekkie">Ekkie</a>, and <a href = "/products/btpy9nbv?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Promo-Card-Tup">Tup</a>. If goblins could read, they'd tell you to collect the set!</p>

<p>Today, we're just giddy about introducing you to your new best friend. Her name's Reepazo, and she's the new <a href = "http://freerpgday.com" target="_blank">Free RPG Day</a> promo character for the <a href = "/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/mummysMask">Pathfinder Adventure Card Game Mummy's Mask Adventure Path</a>. You'll be able to pick up a copy at <a href = "http://freerpgday.com/stores.htm" target="_blank">participating hobby retailers</a>, or you can <a href = "/products/btpy9t80?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Promo-Card-Reepazo">preorder her on paizo.com</a>. She comes with a character card, a role card, a token card, and most importantly, LOTS OF BUGS. (Don't worry&mdash;<a href = "http://pe.usps.com/text/pub52/pub52c5_007.htm#ep183913" target = "_blank">postal regulations prevent us from shipping most of the poisonous ones</a>.)</p>

<p><i>Best earring.</i></p></div>

<p>Reepazo is a Goblin Bugzapper. No, really. She combines two elements that surprisingly rarely coincide in the Pathfinder universe: she can turn herself into a bug, and she can turn you into a bug. Basically, everybody's a bug. It's Free BUG Day!</p>

<p>No, actually, it's Free RPG Day, on Saturday, June 17. Reepazo will be there. Will you?</p>

<p>(If you <i>can't</i> be there, don't worry: <a href = "/products/btpy9t80?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Promo-Card-Reepazo">Reepazo will be for sale right here on paizo.com starting July 1</a>.)</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline">Final Countdown to PaizoCon 2017!</h1>

<p class="date">Wednesday, May 10, 2017</p>

<div itemprop="articlebody">

<p itemprop="description">Everything is coming together for <a href = "/paizocon">PaizoCon</a>, which starts in a little over 2 weeks. The office is abuzz with final preparations as all of our departments pull together to bring this convention to our fans. Schedules posted on paizo.com last week and the signups are ongoing. Hurry and make your selections, as tomorrow is Lottery Day, how exciting! Some of the games on offer:</p>

<ul><li>Sewer Dragons of Absalom&mdash;an Adventure Card Game adaptation where you play kobolds using pregenerated character decks. Brought to you by David Jacobson and Tyler Beck.</li>
<li>Skeleton Moon&mdash;a retired Pathfinder Society Season 0 scenario ran by the Master of the Dark Stephen Radney-McFarland.</li>
<li>Out of Retirement&mdash;a to be named Season 0 retired scenario hosted by Pathfinder Society developer Linda Zayas-Palmer.</li>
<li>Season 0 Reborn&mdash;Lead developer John Compton offers players the chance to chose which of the retired Season 0 adventures they would like him to run, but no matter the choice all will be challenge filled at his hands.</li></ul>

<p>Besides the lottery games, the Grand Ballroom will once again ring with the sounds of all things organized play. We have tables of Adventure Card Guild, including some demonstrations of the Mummy's Mask Base Set, occurring in the morning and evening slots. Players may check out a base set for use during the afternoon slot, so you can play Adventure Card Game all day long!</p>

<p>Mid-Season 8 adventures are the Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild offerings, as well as tables of some of the replayable scenarios such as PFS 5-08: The Confirmation, PFS 6-10: The Wounded Wisp, and PFS 7-10: The Consortium Compact. Sunday evening sees the world premier of the new multi-table modular special PFS 8-99: The Solstice Scar. There are also non-Paizo hosted Pathfinder Society games available in the middle slot. The quest series "Honor's Echo" will run during the hours the Grand Ballroom is open for games, for players wanting to learn about Pathfinder Society or play shorter, 1-hour adventures.</p>

<p>For the mid-day slot, we close the doors on the Grand Ballroom so that attendees have the ability to attend our numerous panels. Want to know more about building Starfinder aliens? You're in luck! Have a question for the Paizo designers? We have that covered too! As well as panels on planning organized play, how comics can make you a better GM, using props in your games, and a myriad of other topics.</p>

<p>Finally, back by popular demand is Quiz Night hosted by John Compton. Join us in the Grand Ballroom on Saturday after the banquet to test your knowledge and see if you can rise victorious. This is a team-based competition, so gather some friends and join us!</p>

<p>Also returning this year is the Pathfinder Society scavenger hunt. A sheet should be in your welcome packet, otherwise stop by the Grand Ballroom and pick one up from the headquarters table. Collect signatures while you meet and greet people at the convention and unlock a reward for your Pathfinder Society character.</p>

<h2>Ohio Pathfinder Society Looking for Origins Volunteers!</h2>

<p>Venture Captain Michael McNerney is looking for a few individuals to fill some slots at the upcoming Origins Game Faire in Columbus, Ohio, from June 14 to 19. Interested volunteers should sign up using the following links: <a href = "http://ohiopfs.org/origins/origins-gm-application/" target = "_blank">Roleplaying GM link</a> and <a href = "http://ohiopfs.org/origins/origins-acg-gm-application/" target = "_blank">Card Guild Organizer</a> or by sending VC Mike an email at <a href = "mailto:ohiopfs@gmail.com">ohiopfs@gmail.com.</a></p>

<p>That wraps up my PaizoCon summary. I'm off to print boons, pack up supplies, and shift focus to Gen Con tasks. Next week, I'll return with a peek into the Gen Con offerings, including a hint of the upcoming Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild Season 9.</p>

<p>Explore&mdash;Report&mdash;Cooperate!</p>

  <p class="date"><time datetime="2017-05-09T22:00:00Z">May 9, 2017, 03:00 pm</time></p>
  <p itemprop="description">With Thurston Hillman's <a href = "/products/btpy9pn4"><em>Pathfinder Adventure Path 118: Siege of Stone</em></a> about to hit subscribers, this is a great time to talk about themes and stereotypes and writing with intention. You often hear that people insist that their pop culture&mdash;their video games, their action movies, their roleplaying games&mdash;should be free of politics and "agendas," but the truth is that the personal is just politics on the small scale. Your own needs, opinions, and preferences become politics when shared or opposed by multiple people.

<h1 itemprop="headline">Ironfangs and Scumbag Dames!</h1>
<p class="date">Tuesday, May 9, 2017</p>

<div itemprop="articleBody">

<p itemprop="description">With Thurston Hillman's <a href = "/products/btpy9pn4"><em>Pathfinder Adventure Path 118: Siege of Stone</em></a> about to hit subscribers, this is a great time to talk about themes and stereotypes and writing with intention. You often hear that people insist that their pop culture&mdash;their video games, their action movies, their roleplaying games&mdash;should be free of politics and "agendas," but the truth is that the personal is just politics on the small scale. Your own needs, opinions, and preferences become politics when shared or opposed by multiple people. As an author or a game developer, at some point you have to accept the responsibility that everything you create carries cultural weight, that you describe what is and isn't normal, what is and isn't moral, who is and isn't a protagonist or a villain or even a person. The orcs of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings books were self-loathing and aggressive, without personal goals or culture, while elves are nuanced and individual and reflect a long and storied history&mdash;one of these groups is defined as "people" while the other are faceless opponents. Killing a hundred of one is the background noise of the trilogy; killing one of the other is a tragedy that Tolkien uses to dredge up emotion in his readers.</p>

<p>And yes, I realize the irony of this specific example as I talk about an Adventure Path built around conflict with and killing hundreds of members of a specific species.</p>

<p>These are fictional races, but every creative work paints a perspective of the world, and who does and doesn't fill what roles. Many creative repeat what we see in the world around us. Some of us try to depict idealized worlds we want our world to become. Still others exaggerate the evils of the real world into more dire or naked threats, washing away the shades grey to highlight change they feel the world needs. There's no one right way to wield the influence you have as a creative, except perhaps to remain ignorant of it.</p>

<p>One of the common themes in the way Paizo wields our power is to depict women and minorities as heroes. One of our big goals as a group is to paint a world where anyone can be the champion. And we've done that well; we've painted women as crusading nights, spellcasters of devastating power, freedom fighters, gladiatorial champions, and swashbuckling pirates with hearts of gold. Ironfang Invasion specifically kicks off with a female companion there to aid and train the PCs as they grow from nobodies into heroes. But sometimes that urge to champion a cause can push too far, and we end up putting a group on a pedestal. The elves from Tolkien feel flat to a lot of readers because they're TOO good and TOO nice and TOO enlightened; even at their worst, they feel like overbearing parents, rather than people who make mistakes, dirty their hands, or occasionally are just jerks.</p>

<p>The one thing Paizo rarely does is paint women as jerks.</p>

<p>That's not to say we never portray female villains. Queen Ileosa, Areelu Vorlesh, and Queen Abrogail Thrune are unabashedly wicked. The Inner Sea region in general overflows with evil women rulers. All of a certain type: politically powerful, charismatic, and conventionally attractive. Pathfinder has plenty of female villains.</p>

<p>Like I said: The one thing we rarely portray are female jerks. The scum. The bastards. The glorious panoply of disreputable antagonists. Women in Pathfinder or fiction in general are rarely allowed to be dirty and violent and unladylike. One of our goals in <a href = "/pathfinder/adventurePath/ironfangInvasion">Ironfang Invasion</a> was to portray a huge variety of female antagonists, from the traditional "sexy spellcaster" like Arlantia (you'll meet her next month), to masters of tactics and arms like Azersi and Kosseruk, to crazed cultists like Naphexi, to violently anti-social scum like Jang and the redcap Dearga Finlay. In <a href = "http://paizo.com/products/btpy9pn4"><em>Siege of Stone</em></a>, author Thurston Hillman gives us the small-potatoes gang leader in Origa, the lecherous bully in Chief Grax, the condescending intellectual in Zanathura, the greedy mercenary in Kisegar, and the scheming manipulator in Elacnida.</p>

<p>We still have plenty of female allies and heroes&mdash;Aubrin, Gendowyn, Navah, the overeager treant Longfrond&mdash;but Ironfang Invasion is also packed full of women being every flavor of villainous and objectionable&mdash;an important facet of representation oft forgotten in our efforts to display a given group as varied, diverse, and fallible. Save your pedestals for statues, and let the women of the Ironfang Invasion scheme, belch, and stab their way into your hearts.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2: Welcoming Committee</h3>

<p>Veena Heliu, the Precentor Martial for Magic, was often described as fiery for reasons that had nothing to do with her red hair. She was deep in an argument when they arrived, her raised voice audible from the other end of a long marble hallway. Pages wearing indoor boots of soft leather shuffled past silently, carrying scrolls in secure tubes and not making eye contact with Zae or each other. Keren, by contrast, had the conspicuous jingle and clank of armor to accompany her every step.</p>

<p>Zae couldn't distinguish Veena's distant words through their echoes, and she was almost disappointed when the yelling cut off abruptly upon their approach, replaced with the sibilant hisses of angry whispers. From the set of Keren's jaw, this wasn't normal; Zae surmised that whatever the source of the buzz Keren had mentioned, it had not been resolved overnight.</p>

<p>Zae had never been inside Vigil's Crusader War College, but Keren's father had taught here, and his children had grown up within Castle Overwatch's walls. Zae and Appleslayer followed as Keren led the way with the familiarity of muscle memory rather than recent experience. She tried a couple times to make conversation, but Keren's face was drawn tight and Zae left her to her own thoughts.</p>

<p>"Keren Rhinn! Right on time." Most people towered over Zae&mdash;she was used to that&mdash;but she suspected Veena Heliu could tower over people even taller than the sorcerer herself. She radiated such power and certainty that the air was alive with it. Zae looked around, but saw no one else; whomever Veena had been arguing with had left, if they'd ever been physically present at all.</p>

<p>"Reporting as summoned," Keren answered, stopping sharply at a respectful distance. Veena was a half-elf, and though she was not Keren's true aunt, Keren had referred to her as "Auntie Veena" on the walk over. There was no sign of that informality on Keren's part now. "This is Sister Zae, Cleric of Brigh."</p>

<p>The precentor nodded curtly toward Zae, then surveyed Appleslayer, who stood alert at attention in his polished saddle. "And this is your mount, ready for his combat training." More often than not, the people Zae encountered were surprised to see dogs in such a role, but Heliu's life revolved around the art of war and the duty of defense. Her lack of surprise was no surprise. A note of approval hung in her voice, which might or might not have been Zae's hopeful imagination.</p>

<p>Appleslayer's plumed tail twitched back and forth once in a single low, uncertain wag.</p>

<p>Heliu held out her hands, one toward each of them. "Are you ready?"</p>

<p>Keren hesitated.</p>

<p>"Speak freely, Crusader."</p>

<p>Keren cleared her throat. "Excuse me, ma'am, but I'd requested</p>

<p>to be briefed on the reason for the fast transport."</p>

<p>"I didn't receive orders to brief you. I'm afraid your request's</p>

<p>been denied from higher up."</p>

<p>Zae looked between the two women. Keren always accepted</p>

<p>command decisions, even when they left her conflicted&mdash;and Zae knew when she was conflicted, because the bottled-in frustration came out in the safety of their home&mdash;but Zae had also seen Keren's can't we work around this? face enough to recognize it now.</p>

<p>"Well, thank you all the same," Zae said to defuse the silence. "I would be excited to spend weeks on a boat, but I'm sure Keren's glad to be getting to where we're going."</p>

<p>"Quite so," Heliu answered. "I'll be taking you into a private park. It's discreet, unchanging, and no one pays much attention to how many people are wandering around there. I must return immediately to my duties, so I won't be able to direct you to the Seventh Church myself, but someone from the church will be there to meet us."</p>

<p>They both took Heliu's offered hands, and Zae and Keren each buried their free hands in Appleslayer's fur. The sensation was slight&mdash;just an odd weightlessness in Zae's stomach&mdash;and then it was over. Her feet were now on grass. Whereas they had left at noon, they arrived in a place where the sun was noticeably lower in the afternoon sky. A copse of trees at the edge of the park made an almost accidental clearing that would be difficult to stumble upon by chance. In different circumstances, it would have been a perfect spot for a moonlit tryst.</p>

<p>Zae checked herself and her companions. No limbs seemed to be out of place. Veena had already disappeared again. Appleslayer whuffed softly under his breath, and Zae shook her head. "No exploring for now. Stay close."</p>

<p>When they stepped around the corner and into the larger park, they found an expanse of lush green meadow dotted with people lounging in twos and threes. In front of them, sitting on a stone bench with a small leather-bound book in her hands, was a woman dressed in the robes of Iomedae.</p>

<p>"I leave you to it." Veena nodded toward the initiate, and exchanged quiet words with Keren. Zae was too distracted studying her surroundings to pay attention.</p>

<p>The priestess stood and tucked the book away into the folds of her robes as Zae and her companions approached, greeting them with a warm smile. Roughly the same age as Darrin's aunt Strella, she had straight honey-brown hair and a particular intensity Zae had often seen in people who were strongly devoted to their gods. "Welcome," the woman said to them, gaze lingering on the white and gold of Keren's armor. "You must be our new arrivals from Lastwall."</p>

<p>"That we are." Keren held up her left palm in greeting,</p>

<p>displaying the sword-mark there. Zae and Keren both bore the shield on their right palms. While Zae had her odd gear-shaped birthmark on her left hand, Keren had received the sword-mark of Iomedae on that palm to identify her as a Vigilant defender of Lastwall. "Crusader Keren Rhinn, and this is Sister Zae. Thank you for meeting us. We're pleased to be in Absalom."</p>

<p>"My name is Kala, initiate of Iomedae. It's a pleasure to be of service to the Knights of Ozem, especially in these trying times. Shall we?" Kala gestured to the path.</p>

<p>They walked along a quiet wooded trail at an unrushed pace that surprised Zae, considering how hasty their departure from Vigil had been once all the gears were in motion. Kala addressed Keren while Zae and Appleslayer followed behind. Keren stole a look over her shoulder, eyebrows drawn in momentary concern, but Zae smiled assuringly in response. She didn't feel slighted. If her organization had greeted them, Zae would have expected the attention to be hers, but it was a pleasant day, with a breeze stirring the tops of the trees, and she was content to walk with her dog, enjoy the weather, and muse about what studying at the Clockwork Cathedral would be like.</p>

<p>"What's the name of this place?" Keren asked.</p>

<p>"Oh! I should be a better guide. I'm sorry. It's always so exciting to meet new people. This is the... well, Greenery Park. We'll be heading west into the center of Absalom from here. It's the best route at this time of day."</p>

<p>Her hesitation sounded like embarrassment, so Zae said, "City planners are strange creatures. Seems like a redundant</p>

<p>name for a park, doesn't it? Does the temple have you on guide duty often?"</p>

<p>"Oh, not often. Well, not until recently. All these servants of Iomedae flocking into the city. I do quite enjoy meeting new members of the order. Not new new, I mean, intending no offense to your possibly extensive and decorated service, but new to me."</p>

<p>They followed a wide carriage road out of the park and entered the bustle of a city headed toward evening. "You mentioned these trying times?" Keren asked.</p>

<p>"Are those camels?" Zae blurted at the same time. While there were a few horses and donkeys to be seen, camels seemed to be the customary beast of burden and transport here. Zae had never seen a camel in person before, and something about them struck her oddly. Maybe it was the spindlyness of their legs, or the long, questing necks, but they just didn't look like they'd been assembled according to an optimal design. Appleslayer stopped in the middle of the road, sniffing the air, and took a few steps toward a narrow side street, whining under his breath.</p>

<p>Zae followed him and peered down the street. She saw an aged pub sign creaking over a narrow doorway, and a shadowed dead end piled with rubbish beyond. She snapped her fingers by her thigh. "Come on, Apple. I know the camels stink, but I need you to stay close."</p>

<p>The dog whined once more, grumbled under his breath, and trotted back to Zae's side. She rubbed between his ears. "Good boy. I know it's all really interesting, but we need to keep up with Keren."</p>

<p>When Zae returned with Appleslayer at her side, Kala was still describing the various troubles the city was facing. Keren, who had never lived in any city but Vigil, listened patiently while the initiate rambled. Zae, who had spent time in several cities, knew the issues to be mostly generic. Sewers not keeping up with rising population; crime in the poorer districts; too much distrust of certain officials and too much trust of others. Meanwhile, there was no mistaking their passage across some invisible border into the next district to the west&mdash;buildings were suddenly closer together and more people crowded the streets, all with different destinations. A knot of chaos resulted, which for Zae manifested as a sea of knees and thighs. She noticed armor, leather and metal; women in soft breeches or simple dresses with minimal ornamentation; and very few shoes that had seen a brush or cloth in recent memory. These were commoners by and large, with a few servants shopping for their masters, and a few lawkeepers maintaining order or soldiers doing their own errands. She hopped up into Appleslayer's saddle and then, while stopped at a corner, stood atop it with Keren's arm for balance, at last catching a glimpse of the peaks of market stall tents.</p>

<p>"What's this place?" Zae asked.</p>

<p>"Ah, this? This is the Gold District."</p>

<p>A passing servant with a broad basket at her hip bumped into</p>

<p>Kala and looked at her askance. "It's the Coins, actually," she said, and then moved on.</p>

<p>Kala cleared her throat, ignoring the imposition, but Zae exchanged a glance with Keren. A translation error, perhaps, though Kala didn't have any particular foreign accent that Zae could place. "Whatever you call it, it's the trade quarter, if you will. Anything can be bought and sold here, at any time of day or night. Is there something like it where you come from? Lastwall, wasn't it? They never tell me anything about the arrivals, just when to be at the meeting point."</p>

<p>The constant questions were having an effect on Keren's bearing, though Zae knew no one else would have noticed the shift in her armored shoulders. "Have you always studied here in Absalom?" she asked, redirecting the initiate.</p>

<p>"Oh, I've only arrived recently, myself. It's the home of so many miracles, you know. Legendary for its concentration of relics, too.</p>

<p>I've heard that practically everything of religious significance probably finds its way here eventually. Have you heard that?"</p>

<p>"I hadn't, actually."</p>

<p>"Well, apparently it's true. The Pathfinder Society has its headquarters here, and securing relics is one of the many things it does. And there are so many museums! Both public and private collections. This truly is where antiquities are traded and where history lives."</p>

<p>"Speaking of living history, are you taking us directly to the church, or to our lodgings first?" Keren asked. The row houses here weren't exactly crumbling, but they looked like drunken old men in the small hours, propping each other up as they stumbled home from a tavern. It would be interesting to stay in one of them, Zae thought. She imagined them smelling of booze on the inside and swaying slightly around last call.</p>

<p>"Oh, to your lodgings of course, so that you can freshen up before you present yourselves to the church. You'll be staying just west of here, in the Foreign Quarter, where most of the city's guest housing is. I brought you this way because it's just so important to know where the markets are in a new city, don't you think?" Kala returned her attention to Keren. "Everything can be bought and sold in the Coins."</p>

<p>Keren nodded. "As you said. It's very good to know; you have our thanks."</p>

<p>Kala pressed her point. "Everything."</p>

<p>"Indeed, Sister."</p>

<p>"So, if you were searching for someone who'd stolen something,</p>

<p>perhaps to sell it, this might be where you would look. Wouldn't you say?"</p>

<p>Zae knew the expression that now crossed Keren's face. For a moment, she wore the same one. "I daresay you know the city far better than we, Sister." Keren was only that formal when she was choosing her words carefully. "Surely a city this large has many crevices for people who don't want to be found."</p>

<p>"Yes, surely. But where are they sending you to look?"</p>

<p>"Look for what?" Zae asked, nudging Apple to keep up. Kala didn't spare her a glance.</p>

<p>"It's all right." Their guide shifted closer to Keren. "I know why you're really here. I so desperately want to help, but I'm a new initiate so they've got me just escorting the seasoned ones in. I don't get to see any adventure for myself. Take a little pity on me and let me live vicariously through your mission. The other groups have all told me where they're being sent..."</p>

<p>"I didn't think it was exactly secret," Keren said, and Kala's posture straightened expectantly. "My mission is to train at the Tempering Hall. I'll be deepening my understanding of my faith, studying the Acts of Iomedae, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Kala waved her graceful hand. "There's no need for such pretense."</p>

<p>"Pretense?"</p>

<p>"Your cover story is practiced to perfection. It's completely believable. But I mean your actual mission, of course. The... artifact. You know."</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't," Keren said. "Perhaps you've confused us with another traveling party."</p>

<p>Kala smiled a smile that was just on the forced side of amusement. "Anyway, it doesn't matter. Tell me, in&mdash;Lastwall, did you say?&mdash;is torture a part of your training?"</p>

<p>"The giving or the enduring?" Keren answered, her voice just a notch too tight to be joking. Kala tossed her head back and laughed.</p>

<p>"Oh, you're lovely. The enduring, of course."</p>

<p>Keren stiffened again, and Appleslayer's muscles tensed as if he'd caught wind of an unpleasant smell. He knew how to read Keren's body language as well as Zae herself did, or perhaps an actual scent signaled her wariness to the dog's sensitive nose.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, you're very loyal. I can see why they chose you." Kala turned a corner, leading them down a narrow alley that ended at a crumbling wall. "But unfortunately, that loyalty means you're of little use to me. I've given you plenty of chances to answer me freely, but those answers will be carved out of you if need be. No one can hold out against torture forever." Four shadows dropped from the low roofs on either side of the alley. "This is your last chance."</p>

<p>Zae blinked. At times like this, when the course of events took a turn she wasn't expecting, she felt like a clock that had just started to run down and would be fine again after a bit of winding. While it was a relief to see that, once again, Appleslayer's wary instincts had been correct, Zae felt strangely betrayed. There had been something endearing about the guide who didn't know the city.</p>

<p>Three men and a woman in leather armor and shrouding hoods converged on them, weapons drawn. Rather, they converged on Keren&mdash;she had the big sword, and had held Kala's attention. Zae and Appleslayer hadn't registered as a threat. This was something Zae could use to her advantage; she retreated a few steps and dropped her hand to her side, palm back, signaling for Appleslayer to wait. She called upon Brigh to bless her allies, and saw courage surge through Keren and the dog.</p>

<p>Keren drew her long, straight-bladed sword up into a parry, deflecting an attacker's sword with a clang of angry metal. "I don't know what you think I have, but I swear to you I don't have it. We're just here to train."</p>

<p>"Unlikely," Kala said, drawing a sword from the folds of her robe. "We've been waiting for the Knights of Ozem to get involved. How convenient that they always arrive at the same place. So. Lead us to the artifact and we'll spare you. Defy us and we'll kill you both, and the next knights they send after you, and the next."</p>

<p>Zae curled her hand into a fist; Apple, recognizing the wordless command, sprang forth with teeth bared.</p>

<p>"Tezryn&mdash;behind you!" one of the attackers shouted, and the robed woman turned. She slashed at Appleslayer with her sword, but the dog sprang out of range. He circled and made a lunge for Kala's calf. The dog had enough bulk to throw an unprepared opponent off balance and enough herding instinct to shuttle enemies toward Keren's blade, but Kala sidestepped, raising her sword to parry Keren's attack. No matter how many times Apple engaged in combat, Zae was always fascinated to see him employ the same leaping and bounding maneuvers that were trademarks of his breed's energetic play.</p>

<p>Zae ticked over the spells she had prepared that morning, without having known she would be teleported to Absalom or dropped into the middle of an alley brawl. She now knew several things about their guide: not only was she not a cleric of Iomedae, but if her first instinct was to strike out with a blade rather than a spell, then she likely wasn't an aspiring priestess of any god at all. Meanwhile, something odd was tickling at her senses, something about the way the rest of them moved that wasn't quite right.</p>

<p>Kala&mdash;no, Tezryn&mdash;dodged Keren's next attack, but that put her right in the path of Appleslayer's teeth. He latched onto her hamstring, jerking his head from side to side. Keren neatly sliced the back of Tezryn's other leg, bringing her down, then turned her attention to the closest attacker, matching him swing for swing.</p>

<p>Appleslayer released his prey and turned toward one of the other shadowy figures, a fury of sharp teeth and strong paws, nimbly ducking swords and unarmed swipes. He would come in from behind to keep an enemy turning and distracted, and then Keren would take the foe down with one fierce swing. He and Keren fought as one, seamlessly aiding each other with each foe. While Apple's emotional devotion was to Zae, he was equally loyal to Keren. She had trained him well, and their rapport was a beautiful, fluid dance that just happened to result in a certain amount of blood.</p>

<p>But this time, it didn't. Keren sliced a man's arm clean off, and it fell twitching without the trademark arterial gush. Zae cursed herself for not realizing it sooner, and called upon Brigh to bring down her holy wrath upon the attackers. The maimed man fell, and the others cringed and staggered at the sudden assault of light. Though remarkably whole, they were not alive. And neither was their leader. She had struggled to her knees at the periphery of the fight, but she cried out and curled herself into a tight ball under the assault of power.</p>

<p>Appleslayer and Keren tore through the attackers one by one. Their blows rang against Keren's shield. When all of them were on the ground, Zae finished them with another surge of holy power. The initiate, however, had worked her way to her feet somehow, and was stumbling toward the mouth of the alley. In a fluid movement, Keren freed her shield from her arm and threw it like a skipping stone. It scuttled across the cobbled street and cut Tezryn's wounded legs out from under her, sending her sprawling. When Keren pushed the leader onto her back, she was glassy-eyed but snarling.</p>

<p>Keren reversed her grip and held her sword over Tezryn's throat, two-handed. "What do you want from us? Tell me!" Her hands were steady and the swordpoint didn't waver, but Zae knew her well enough to hear the hurt in her voice.</p>

<p>When the mock-initiate only grinned at her with bloody teeth, Keren brought the blade down with such force that it struck all the way through the woman's throat and impacted the pavement beneath. Tezryn gurgled, and was still.</p>

<p>Zae started to call Appleslayer back to her, but the dog was approaching Keren, so she held her tongue. He sniffed at the knight, tail low, pacing around her like an anxious child while she checked the other attackers to make sure they'd been put down for good. Now that they were still, peeking into their hoods showed skin stretched tight over starved cheeks, and the teeth within their parted mouths were longer than they should have been.</p>

<p>Tezryn was dead without a doubt, but that didn't put Zae at ease. She pressed her fingers to the guide's forehead, then brought them to her own nose. The scent was faint, but it held notes of rosemary and clean linen. "Undead, and disguising it," Zae said. "Unguent of revivification, I think. And she's definitely not Iomedae's priestess. She concealed both her appearance and her aura." Beneath the vestments, she wore the same leather armor as the others.</p>

<p>"Are you sure she wasn't just alive and evil?"</p>

<p>"Positive. I called Brigh's light down upon the undead, not the living."</p>

<p>"So the others... ?"</p>

<p>"Probably not under her thrall, but likely she told them where to go for a good feast. None of them bit you, did they?"</p>

<p>Keren shook her head. "Apple bit one of them, though. Should we be worried about that?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I don't think so, but better to be safe than dog food." Zae motioned the dog over to her and extended a hand. Apple sniffed cautiously at her fingers. They still smelled of the ointment, Zae realized. She wiped her hand on her coat and gave him her other hand instead, whispering to Brigh and sharing a soft, warming light from her fingertips through Apple's fur, concentrating on following the warmth all the way through him. She encountered none of the sorts of obstacles that would indicate disease or corruption. "He's fine."</p>

<p>"Which means that our real welcoming party..." Keren and Zae exchanged a long look.</p>

<p>Zae mounted up on Appleslayer's saddle while Keren took the vestments of Iomedae from Tezryn's corpse and re-shouldered their supplies. "Apple, that alley you were curious about. Can you lead us back there? Good dog!"</p>

<p>As they hurried away, Zae took a quick glance back over her shoulder. Figures were already emerging from the shadows and creeping toward the corpses. Zae had seen squatters and street gangs scavenge what they could from the dead in the seedier quarters of other cities. It felt a little strange to her, knowing that it was happening, but it worked in her favor; there would likely be little left for the attackers' masters to find.</p>

<p>In the alley with the pub sign, Apple's nose led them through a heap of rubbish to the dead end and a broken, upturned crate, underneath which was bundle of bloodied rags that had once been fine cloth; it must have been the actual Kala's underdress. Keren cursed and turned away, but Apple stayed by Zae's side while she peeled back the stiffening fabric. There was little flesh to be found. Small scavengers hovered, drawn by the blood and determined to find a scrap to eat.</p>

<p>"Get, you!" she heard Keren shout, followed by a scattering of refuse and a scuffle of many tiny feet. Half a dozen rats scampered out of range of Keren's sword, but didn't flee from sight, unwilling to give up the chance of a meal. Keren crouched over the cloth, her expression set and cold.</p>

<p>Zae gave her a moment, then asked, "What do you think they wanted so badly that they'd kill a priestess just to ask us questions?" "I don't know," Keren said grimly. "But we're going to find out."</p>

<p itemprop="description">Last Friday we took a look at the envoy. As soon as we announced the operative as a class, many fans began to theorize it would act as the "star thief," and wondered how it would be different from the rogue class in Pathfinder. There are certainly some thematic similarities between the two classes, but just as a 16th-century highwayman's tactics and skills were different from a modern hacker's, a character with a knack for stealth, security systems, and unexpected attacks in Starfinder should be significantly different from a Pathfinder rogue. We need a class that can easily serve as spy, assassin, thief, hacker, investigator, and trailblazer. That was the spark for the operative, which gets the following description in the <a href = "/products/btpy9qy1"><em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>You're a shadow. You move swiftly, strike suddenly, and always have an escape plan. You're a consummate professional, and always get the job done, whether it's scouting enemy lines, hunting down criminals, stealing and smuggling items, or assassinating key figures. As an operative, you're skilled in a wide variety of disciplines and specialties, and use speed, mobility, and your quick wits rather than relying on heavy weapons. You excel at the art of surprise, whether it's sniping targets from cover or striking while their backs are turned. Your cause may be righteous, but you have no problem fighting dirty&mdash;achieving your objective is all that matters.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The operative is very much a character skilled at working outside the norms of society. Whether committing crimes, hunting criminals, or just living on the fringes, operatives find ways to get things done, though their methods don't always meet with public approval. This takes skill, so the operative gets 8 skill points per level, and 16 class skills. Operatives also get the operative's edge class feature granting a bonus to all skill checks (as well as initiative checks). The class also receives special bonuses at 7th level with any skill in which the character has the Skill Focus feat.</p>

<p>The operative knows that sometimes getting things done means doing some damage, and the class gains a fair base attack bonus, poor Fortitude saves but good Reflex and Will saves, light armor, and proficiency (and eventually specialization) with basic melee weapons, small arms, and sniper weapons. The operative can augment the damage done with basic melee weapons and small arms with his trick attack.</p>

<p>Trick attack may sound on the surface like Pathfinder's sneak attack, but it works very differently. An operative can attempt a trick attack regardless of the combat situation&mdash;it's not restricted to targets that are flanked or have the flat-footed condition. Instead, the operative must make an opposed skill check (normally Bluff, Intimidate, or Stealth, though class features can alter that) to gain an advantage over his foe for the trick attack to function. At higher levels, the operative can also apply penalties to foes hit with a trick attack, beginning with the flat-footed and off-target conditions and expanding from there (potentially even applying such effects to sniper weapon attacks).</p>

<p>Because operatives have different methods and thus focus on different techniques, each operative selects a specialization. We present seven specializations in the core rulebook&mdash;daredevil, detective, explorer, ghost, hacker, spy, and thief. Each has an effect on that operative's trick attack (a detective can use Sense Motive to activate her trick attack, for example), and grants bonuses to specific skills and access to new abilities.</p>

<p>Finally, operatives also have exploits&mdash;special tricks they learn as they gain levels to help customize their abilities. While the selection of exploits is fairly small at first, they expand as the operative levels up, making increasingly powerful exploits available. Here's a sample of a 10th-level exploit (though the ghost specialization receives it at 5th level):</p>

<blockquote>

<h3>Cloaking Field (Ex)</h3>

<p class = "stat-block">You can bend light around yourself and muffle any minor sounds you make, allowing you to nearly vanish when not moving. Even when you move, you appear only as an outline with blurry features. This cloaking field doesn't make you invisible, but it does make it easier to sneak around. Activating the cloaking field is a move action. While the cloaking field is active, you can use Stealth to hide, even while being directly observed and with no place to hide. Attacking doesn't end the cloaking field, but it does end that particular attempt to hide. If you remain perfectly still for at least 1 round, you gain a +10 bonus to Stealth checks (which doesn't stack with invisibility) until you move.</p>

<p class = "stat-block">Your cloaking field lasts for up to 10 rounds before it becomes inactive. While inactive, the cloaking field recharges automatically at the rate of 1 round of cloaking per minute.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>We already looked at the envoy last week, and we'll present more information on the remaining five classes in the coming weeks. And, of course, you can read the full classes this August when the <a href = "/products/btpy9qy1"><em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em></a> is released at Gen Con!</p>

<p><span itemprop="description">When the <a href="/products/btpy9ssr?Starfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Starfinder-Core-Rulebook"><em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em></a> is released in August, some of the things players are sure to look at first are the classes&mdash;envoy, mechanic, mystic, operative, solarian, soldier, and technomancer. Along with the core races and character themes, these classes are a major part of defining a Starfinder player character.</p>

<p class="BodyCopyIndent">Of course, we don't want to make people wait until August to learn anything about all the fun things we have crammed into our new game, so we're going to be doing a series of class previews over the coming weeks, starting with the envoy. So, let's take a quick look at what the book has to say about the envoy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<em>You make your way in the universe with a charming smile, quick wit, and keen sense of self-preservation, and excel at getting others to do what you want. You might be a trickster, hustler, or con artist, or you might serve as an actor, ambassador, or businessperson, paving the way for negotiation through kind words or the occasional dirty trick. You are often the group's strategist, using your quick wit and tactical acumen to push your friends to greater heights. You may also be skilled in diplomacy, serving as the face for a starship crew, talking your way into restricted systems or gaining audiences with local politicians or warlords.</em>&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As that description suggests, envoys are good at social skills. Whether they're using those skills to make friends, fool victims, or threaten foes, envoys often use their wits and charm to get the job done. (And when that doesn't work, well, there's always your laser pistol.) Some of that ability to affect others is modeled by their 8 skill points per level and 16 class skills, which allow them to pick up a lot of social skills while still being able to put ranks into skills such as Acrobatics, Computers, and Stealth, as appropriate for your character concept. The class couples that with an average base attack bonus, poor Fortitude saves, good Reflex and Will saves, light armor, and proficiency (and eventually specialization) with basic melee weapons, grenades, and small arms.</p>


<p>Envoys gain the expertise and skill expertise class features at 1st level. Expertise grants the envoy a 1d6 expertise die that she can add to Sense Motive skill checks as an insight bonus, and skill expertise extends that bonus to one other skill. As the envoy gains levels, she expands the number of skills she can apply her expertise die to and gains expertise talents, which give her additional options for those skills. These can extend the effects of a skill check, allow her to perform acts the skill doesn't normally grant, or alter how long it takes her to use a talent.</p>

<p>Each envoy also gets to select a number of envoy improvisations over the course of her career, beginning at 1st level. These allow the envoy to more directly hinder her foes and aid her allies. Many improvisations are sense-dependent, and some are also language-dependent or mind-affecting. Clever use of envoy improvisations can turn the tide of battle, as the envoy can bolster allies actions and defenses, warn them of impending dangers, and&mdash;with higher-level options&mdash;even give them additional actions in a turn. Here's an example of a 1st-level envoy improvisation.</p>

<blockquote>
<h3>Clever Feint (EX) [sense-dependent]</h3>
<p class="StatBlock1">As a standard action, you can fake out an enemy within 60 feet, making that enemy open to your attacks. Attempt a Bluff check with the same DC as a check to feint against that enemy (though this isn';t a standard check to feint, so Improved Feint and Greater Feint don't apply). Even if you fail, that enemy is flat-footed against your attacks until the end of your next turn. If you succeed, the enemy is also flat-footed against your allies' attacks until the end of your next turn. You can't use clever feint against a creature that lacks an Intelligence score.</p>
<p class="StatBlock1">At 6th level, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to treat a failed Bluff check for clever feint as if it were a success.</p>
</blockquote>

We'll present more information on the other six classes in the coming weeks, and of course, you can read the full classes this August when the <a href="/products/btpy9ssr?Starfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Starfinder-Core-Rulebook"><em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em></a> releases at Gen Con!

<p>Next, for those characters that think there are no consequences for starting a fight when they are in town, we give you the stocks.</p>

<p><br />Every villain needs a podium to help communicate their plans for the future of Golarion, and for that the below lectern should work beautifully.</p>

<p><br />Now for the larges. We start with the Grave Monument, which many of you may recognize from the cover of Horror Adventures.</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline">Organizations of the Adventurer's Guide</h1>
<p class="date">Thursday, May 4, 2017</p>

<div itemprop="articlebody">

<div class = "blurb180"><a href = "/products/btpy9sjo?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Adventurers-Guide"><img src = "//static1.paizo.com/image/product/catalog/PZO/PZO1138_180.jpeg"></a></div>

<p>So I just finished the final <a href = "/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ljqu?Mythological-Monsters-of-Bestiary-6"><em>Bestiary 6</em> preview blog</a> last week, so you know what that means! Yup&hellip; time to start doing preview blogs for the next hardcover down the line&mdash;the <a href = "/products/btpy9sjo?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Adventurers-Guide"><em>Adventurer's Guide</em></a>!</p>

<p itemprop="description">As opposed to the hardcovers before (<a href = "/products/btpy9r1y?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Bestiary-6"><em>Bestiary 6</em></a>) and after (<a href = "/products/btpy9s2f?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Book-of-the-Damned-Hardcover"><em>Book of the Damned</em></a>), the <a href = "/products/btpy9sjo?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Adventurers-Guide"><em>Adventurer's Guide</em></a> is very much a product for players. The central idea of this book is to focus on several of the more famous (or infamous) organizations active in the Inner Sea region of Golarion. This book is not intended to present these organizations as things your characters can join (we've covered that topic before in numerous ways, after all) but instead to use these groups as themes for the presentation of new archetypes, prestige classes, magic items, spells, feats, and other player options for your characters to take. In effect, these groups serve as your characters' adventuring guides, in that once you become affiliated with them, they can guide your character into new specializations, talents, and powers.</p>

<p>We'll have more to say about the new options in the book later, of course. For now, though, I wanted to take the opportunity to reveal the full list of organizations that are featured in this volume. Some of them are long-standing groups in the setting we've done a lot with before, while others are relatively new. Many of them had their genesis in various Adventure Paths as well, and you can use the additional information in <em>Adventurer's Guide</em> either to bolster their associated Adventure Path in your game or to expand the organization's role beyond that Adventure Path. This does mean that <em>Adventurer's Guide</em> blurs the line between the traditionally "world-neutral" hardcover rulebooks and the setting books&mdash;but that's intentional, since this allows us to draw upon over a decade of lore and inspiration to give additional weight to all these new options for the game. And of course, if you're a GM, these options work just as well for you in building memorable new NPCs for your game as well!</p>

<p>In any event, the organizations covered in Adventurer's Guide are...</p>

<ul><li>Al-Zabriti (Deep-Desert Traditionalists)</li>
<li>Aldori Swordlords (Masters of the Clash of Blades)</li>
<li>Aspis Consortium (Profiteering Syndicate)</li>
<li>Bellflower Network (Eradicators of Halfling Slavery)</li>
<li>Council of Thieves (Rulers of a Criminal Underworld)</li>
<li>Cyphermages (Inheritors of Ancient Arcane Traditions)</li>
<li>Eagle Knights (Vanguard of Liberty)</li>
<li>Gray Maidens (Remnants of a Tyrant's Reign)</li>
<li>Hellknights (Merciless Enforcers of the Law)</li>
<li>Houses of Perfection (Trio of Elite Mystical Monasteries inspired by the Elements)</li>
<li>Lantern Bearers (A Light Against the Coming Darkness)</li>
<li>Magaambya (Inheritors of an Ancient Academy of Arcane Learning)</li>
<li>Mammoth Lords (Beast-Riding Barbarian Tribes)</li>
<li>Pathfinder Society (Adventuring Scholars of Historical Lore)</li>
<li>Red Mantis (Notorious Cult of Deadly Assassins)</li>
<li>Rivethun (Animists Harnessing Personal Struggles for Spiritual Growth)</li>
<li>Silver Ravens (Rebels Against an Oppressive Regime)</li>
<li>Storm Kindlers (Storm-Seeking Devotees of Gozreh)</li>
</ul>

<p>Each organization opens with an evocative half-page illustration to set the mood. I've only got room to show off three for now, though!</p>

<p>Every year, Paizo puts together a team to do battle with others from the greater game community around Seattle for a board game tournament at the Mox Boarding House. This year's Gauntlet: Infinity tournament is set to go down on May 21!</p>

<p>To the victor goes the Gauntlet, and actual metal trophy. We've had the honor of wearing it in the past, and this is our chance to take it back! You can help by <a href = "http://thegauntlet2017.causevox.com/team/Paizo" target = "_blank">donating to our team</a>. Every donation goes toward earning us a number of "power-ups" or special advantages that help us during the games.

<p><i>We're mixing things up a bit! Wednesdays are the new day for organized play-related content. Check back frequently, as in the run up to Gen Con the team is putting together double blogs to deliver previews of the Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild while maintaining all our regular Pathfinder Society content.</i></p>

<p itemprop="description">I took some time this weekend to recharge my gaming batteries. On Saturday, I attended a mini-con at Mox Boardinghouse in Bellevue. During the afternoon, nine tables battled through a myriad of pregenerated specials and harder scenarios such as <a href = "/products/btpy8we6?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-4-26-The-Waking-Rune"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #4-26: The Waking Rune</em></a>. I got a chance to chat with local players and look in on some of their games.

I hear there were several deaths, but the Society emerged victorious.</p>

<p>On Sunday, I GMed a table of <a href = "/products/btpy9k93?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-7-20-All-for-Immortality-Part-1-First-Taste-of-Eternity"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #7-20: All for Immortality, pt. 1: First Taste of Eternity</em></a> for a group of local 5 star GMs. I really like this Seeker arc, in that it pulls together the Aspis storyline into a tight package and wraps up many, but not all, of the loose ends from a Season 7. I can't wait until next weekend, where we tackle part two. Thanks to the players that made my afternoon so enjoyable!</p>

<h2>Player Survey</h2>
<p>One of the focuses when I stepped into the position of Organized Play Coordinator was looking at the data and seeing how it supported our decisions as a team and drove our future plans. We've done that with event support and with scenario reporting. Our next focus is on characters and seasons. We've put together a survey through Survey Monkey to gather this data for use in future decisions. As a thank you for taking time to complete our questions, John put together a thank you boon that may be applied to one of your Pathfinder Society characters.</p>

<h3 style = "text-align: center;"><a href="https://surveymonkey.com/r/PathfinderSociety" target="_blank">Pathfinder Society Survey</a></h3>

<h2 class = "spaced-header-small">Newest 5 Star GMs</h2>
<p>The list of five star GMs grew again this month. Thanks to the GMs who gave of their time and energies to run 150 games for players, including 50 different scenarios and 10 special events. Kudos to the recipients for achieving this milestone and to all 5 star GMs for their time and devotion to our hobby. Without you, the Pathfinder Society would not exist.</p>

<h2>Upcoming Conventions</h2>
<p>Just like the tides, the number of conventions may ebb and flow, but something is always occurring somewhere. To assist in finding events near you, or ones far away you may wish to travel to, here is a list of conventions running Pathfinder Society over the two months. There are many more conventions out there, but these are the ones that requested support through the Pathfinder Society. May is pretty solid, but June's requests are still coming in, so more will add to this list. Consider dropping in and checking one out!</p>

<h2>Convention Volunteer Update</h2>

<p>Volunteers for PaizoCon should have received their schedules. We touched base with Organizer Mike McNerney regarding Origins schedules and he advises they are being sent asap and will arrive before event registration opens. Volunteer lead Bob Jonquet is working on the volunteer schedules for Gen Con. Look for them to arrive before the Gen Con event system goes live at the end of the month. We are adding volunteers to the Gen Con roster this week, so if you're waiting for information, please watch your inbox. No matter what the status, all Gen Con volunteers will receive some communication by weeks end.</p>

<p>Stopping here so I can get back to convention planning. I owe people emails!</p>

<p>Explore, Report, Cooperate!</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline">Pathfinder Adventure Card Game Strategy #9&mdash;Fighting the Banes</h1>

<div itemprop="articlebody">

<p class="date">Tuesday, May 2, 2017</p>

<p>This is the ninth installment of our strategy blog written by game historian <a href = "http://erzo.org/shannon/index.phtml" target = "_blank">Shannon Appelcline</a>. You can read all the installments <a href = "/paizo/blog/tags/adventureCardGameStrategy">here</a>.</p>

<p itemprop = "description">It seems obvious that you want to beat banes, because they can hurt you ... but it turns out that the calculation <i>shouldn't</i> be that simple. It's about knowing when to be brave.</p>

<h2>Be brave if you have armor</h2>
<p>Fighting monsters and leaping through barriers is dangerous, so there's the temptation to massively overinvest in a way that you wouldn't for other encounters&mdash;to increase the odds to an almost certainty.</p>

<p>You should avoid this temptation <i>if you have armor</i>. Most armor (but not shields) allows you to bury (or banish) the card to reduce all damage to you. You should consider this armor's main use: it lets you take chances when you're fighting monsters, without large repercussions.</p>

<p>Yes, you potentially lose a turn, because you may have to fight that same monster on a future turn. But no matter what the results, if the alternative is to use one or more blessing, you probably come out ahead: maybe you win despite the lack of blessing or maybe you won't encounter the monster again. Either way, you potentially gain a turn. And if you were going to play a couple of blessings, you came out way ahead.</p>

<p>So that's what being brave means: <i>take the chance of being defeated by the bane</i>.</p>

<h2>Be even braver if you have no cards</h2>
<p>Similarly, you shouldn't worry too much about losing to monsters if you have few or no cards in your hand. In this case, there's almost no downside, other than the potential to lose an exploration if you must fight the monster again. But since the alternative is usually to burn blessings ... give yourself a good chance, but don't worry about making it a sure chance.</p>

<p><i>Corollary #1: Empty your hand if you're going to lose.</i> Sometimes, you might choose to create the situation where you have few or no cards. This is particularly applicable if you think you're going to lose the fight. Recharge everything that you legally can, so that those cards don't get discarded. Then play all the discardable cards that might give you a bonus on the check. It might seem a waste to spend cards just to give yourself a very unlikely chance of beating a bane, but if you're going to lose your cards anyway, then you might as well try. (If a bane isn't actually going to empty your hand, such as the Charmed Faceless Stalker or many barriers, then obviously this advice does not apply.)</p>

<h2>Be the bravest if you are encountering a summoned bane</h2>
<p>These rules about being willing to lose when faced with damage are especially true when you're fighting summoned monsters that you don't actually benefit from beating. This doesn't include summoned monsters that you must beat to close locations or to defeat barriers like Zombie Horde. But it does include those annoying skeletons that are summoned by the Skeleton Horde barrier or the bandits that are summoned at the Guard Tower. If you don't need to beat them, then don't expend <i>any</i> resources if you have another out (like armor or an empty hand).</p>

<p>The one caveat to this approach is that sometimes those summoned banes are summoned by other banes, and you usually need to beat <i>the summoners</i>. Getting your hand wiped before you do is rarely a good strategy.</p>

<h2>Be less brave otherwise</h2>
<p>If you don't have armor, if you have lots of cards, and if you're not fighting a summoned beast, then you should be less brave; in other words, worry more about beating the beast.</p>

<p>Still, you shouldn't consider victory over the bane a necessity. Think about what you would lose in your hand if you got beat up, add in the possibility of a lost turn if you encounter the bane again, and weigh that against the turns and other opportunities that will be lost from played cards.</p>

<p>Maybe you'll decide that the bane must be beat or maybe you'll decide that it's acceptable to take a chance. The important thing is to consider it as a <i>choice</i>&mdash;not a <i>fait accompli</i>&mdash; just because you're meeting a scary monster or bane.</p>

<p><i>Corollary #1: The more blessings you spend, the more blessings you should spend.</i> Whenever you decide to spend resources rather than bravely taking the chance of being defeated by a bane, you need to make sure that you spend enough. That's because you're now spending turn-resources and you don't want to waste them. So if you're playing no blessing, because the circumstances warrant it, that's fine. But if you're playing one blessing, then consider whether playing two would increase your chances enough to be worthwhile. Every turn <i>and</i> every blessing is an investment: spend them wisely.</p>

<h2>Be even less brave against annoying monsters</h2>
<p>You should work even harder to beat a monster or a barrier if it's particularly annoying for some reason. The Enchanter is a prime example of an annoying monster, because she does 1 Force damage before then 1 Fire damage after every fight. Similarly, Collapsed Ceiling is definitely an annoying barrier, because it can do damage and sticks around. There are even more annoying banes at higher levels.</p>

<p>In general, if a bane has other costs every time you meet it, particularly if those costs are high, or if a bane sticks around on top of a deck or next to someone's character, be a little less brave when fighting it&mdash;not because you're afraid of it, but because you want to get rid of the darned thing!</p>

<h2>Be the least brave against villains and henchmen</h2>
<p>Finally, don't be brave at all when fighting villains and henchmen. They're the critical-path banes in PACG because defeating them lets you close locations and eventually win! These are the fights where you should be quite conservative, making your odds as good as you possibly can (within reason).</p>

<p><i>Corollary #1: Don't spend too much on henchmen.</i> With most henchmen, however, be aware of what's on the other side. Usually, you must do something to close the henchman's location. If you spend your last blessing on the henchman, and then need to banish a blessing to close the location, you did all that work for nothing.</p>

<p>As for villains...</p>

<p><i>Illustration by Remko Troost</i></p></div>

<p>Born into a prominent family on Absalom Station, the envoy who calls herself Navasi spent much of her childhood avoiding her parents in their "sky-villa," as they called their sprawling, six-story home in the Nyori Palisades. Navasi's mother had designs on her canny-but-headstrong daughter inheriting the family's business. Her father had visions of a queenly young woman sitting in silk among the station's most prominent socialites.</p>

<p>Navasi wanted neither. A quip on her lips, she eschewed glitzy playdates and family soirees in favor of zipping through Absalom Station's streets with her best friends, the children of the household employees. She'd take the rush of riding a screaming hovercycle over the pompous sniggering of the wealthy any day of the week.</p>

<p>As she befriended more and more stationers from less-privileged walks of life, Navasi's irritation with her parents and their deliberate aloofness from the rest of society turned into outright disgust. The inequities of Absalom Station, where the rich lived in fortified enclaves and the poor lived in little more than metal boxes, pained her. Simply giving away her pocket money didn't seem like enough. She began to dream of a fairy-tale life in which she could steal the affluent's unearned wealth and give it to those truly in need, and idolized the Free Captains of the Diaspora&mdash;pirates living by their own rules. Navasi could only imagine the fun she'd have with such freedom&mdash;and the good she'd do, of course.</p>

<p>On the eve of her eighteenth birthday, Navasi sat in her plush quarters, staring at the gold-fibered holo-gown that was to be her debut dress. Two choices stood before her. She could don that false uniform, attend the gala, and accept her mother's gift of an executive position in the family company. Or she could leave.</p>

<p>It took less than an hour for Navasi to slip out of the manor and stow away onto a ship bound for the Diaspora.</p>

<p>Navasi arrived on Broken Rock with a pocketful of stolen credsticks and a gleam in her eye. She quickly signed up as a "procurement specialist" with a contracting firm called the Sixth Finger&mdash;little more than a starfaring thieves' guild&mdash;ready to use her new position to steal from exploitative corporations and make herself a hero to those in need.</p>

<p>The reality of life in a pirate enclave hit her like a meteorite. Having quickly blown through her money, and too stubborn to return home in shame, Navasi found she no longer had a choice in which jobs she took. Under the guildrunners' threats, she roughed up innocents, stole from the less fortunate, and worse. Though she never completely lost her egalitarian beliefs, she hardly recognized the naïve idealist she'd once been. A few years in the streets showed her how much of her former life she'd taken for granted, and taught her that if she wanted to take care of others, she first needed to take care of herself. That, at least, she was good at, and she quickly gained a reputation in the gang as the best fast-talker and facewoman around, spinning bold plans and quick wits into fat paydays.</p>

<p>Now a jaded young woman, Navasi found that the wealth from her scores brought little joy without friends to share it with, and she took comfort in the hardscrabble survivalists and secretly softhearted rogues she recruited to her crews. Yet it was in one particular woman that Navasi truly found herself again. Purple-haired and tattooed, with eyes like blue supergiants, the newcomer was outspoken against those in power. She bucked the pirates' authority and operated alone, pulling the sorts of righteous jobs Navasi had once dreamed of. She was the bravest, most exciting woman Navasi had ever met, and despite Navasi's continuing allegiance to the Sixth Finger, the two quickly became inseparable.</p>

<p>That all came crashing down the day the Sixth Finger arranged to knock over a medship full of supplies bound for Absalom Station. To the gang's leaders, the ship's mission&mdash;aiding refugees of a wartorn star system&mdash;was inconsequential compared to the valuable drugs in its cargo bays. Navasi's objections were overruled.</p>

<p>It was the final straw. Together, Navasi and her partner formulated a plan, alerting the medship to the imminent heist and carefully sabotaging the fighters the gang had designated for the assault. It all might have gone unnoticed, had the gang's resident technomancer not decided to check the security cams one final time. In the ensuing ambush, Navasi and her partner were pinned down, their backs to the sole spaceworthy ship&mdash;a single-seat fighter with only enough life support for one of them. Unwilling to leave her companion, Navasi prepared for them to go out in a blaze of glory&mdash;only to have her partner shove her into the cockpit and slam the canopy. As Navasi scrabbled with the latch, the other woman winked, pulled the pins on her grenades, and sprinted straight at their ambushers.</p>

<p>The wealthy scion of Absalom Station died that day, as did the pirate she'd become. As she made her way back to Absalom Station with the medship, knowing that neither the Sixth Finger nor her spurned family would ever stop looking for her, she forsook both of her previous incarnations. Abandoning her old identity, she took the name of her fallen love&mdash;Navasi&mdash;and swore that henceforth she'd carry on the fight they'd started together, only stealing from those who deserved it, putting her finger in the eye of anyone who thrived on exploitation, regardless of which side of the law they were on. Knowing she'd need a new appearance as well, she continued borrowing from her partner, dyeing her jet-black hair purple and adding a single blue contact. Yet when she considered mimicking the original Navasi's tattoos, she was shocked to learn that they were symbols of Weydan, the god of discovery and equality, famous for taking mortal form. Though her partner had never spoken of religion, Navasi took it as a sign, and even holds out some hope that perhaps her companion might have been more than she seemed, though she recognizes that such thoughts are probably just a manifestation of her grief.</p>

<p>Today, Navasi has built a reputation&mdash;perhaps more than is truly wise for a woman with a price on her head&mdash;as a talented freelance captain, putting together crews for adventures ranging from planetary scouting and private security to her old talent for "procurement," though she's careful about what sorts of jobs she and her friends take on. Navasi still believes in freedom for all, spreading the wealth, and taking plutocrats down a peg&mdash;but she also knows the value of earning credits, and takes pride in the ability to take care of herself and her crew (though she still has a sometimes inconvenient tendency to empty her pockets for those in need). As a scoundrel, a fast-talker, and a brilliant negotiator, Navasi is happiest when the chips are down and lives hang in the balance, as that's when you truly know who your friends are. Above all, she knows to always look beneath the surface, for like Navasi herself, nothing is ever quite what it seems.</p>
