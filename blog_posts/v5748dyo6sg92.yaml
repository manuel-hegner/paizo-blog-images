  \  <p itemprop=\"description\"><i>In this installment of Homebrew Special, we're\
  \ graced by Darren Rigby, who might be the best calligrapher and font creator I've\
  \ ever met. It doesn't surprise me that in his gaming life, his meticulous and creative\
  \ spirit shines through. In the spirit of his home country's Canada geese, take\
  \ a gander.—Mike</i></p> \n    <p>I brought the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game to\
  \ <a href=\"http://www.puzzlers.org\">a puzzle convention</a> that Mike, Chad, Tanis,\
  \ and Gaby were attending. I timidly showed them one of the upgrades I've made for\
  \ the game, and they said I ought to write something for the homebrew blog. The\
  \ thing is, they didn't see just how crazy obsessive I've become about improving\
  \ my game experience.</p> \n    <p>First, the thing I showed off was pretty simple.\
  \ I got some craft store wooden cubes, colored them with markers (Name a brand of\
  \ markers. Yes, that one.) and labelled them with card types. We use these cubes\
  \ during play to track what's left in each location. Since the number of each card\
  \ type in a location is usually no secret, we place the appropriate number of cubes\
  \ by each location deck. We separate banes and boons so we can see at a glance how\
  \ bad a location is. Every time we remove a card from the deck, the corresponding\
  \ cube goes with it.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180913-A1.jpg\"\

  \ <br><i>This all seems perfectly sane. So far.</i>\n     <p></p>\n    </div> \n\
  \    <p>Some compromises had to be made on color. The brand of markers doesn't have\
  \ a whole lot of choices for grey, so armors are darkened to black, and items are\
  \ green. There are light blues, but if you use them on wood, they come out green\
  \ again, so blessings become beige. I have a lot of cubes, but if we ever run out\
  \ of one type, then the purple Extra cubes come into play, and if there are particular\
  \ cards to track, they're made silver Special cubes.</p> \n    <p>Until we know\
  \ which location has the villain, all those unknown bad guys round to henchman red.\
  \ If the villain escapes, incoming cards are accompanied by those dark red/beige\
  \ checkered cubes until we know whether they're a blessing or the villain.</p> \n\
  \    <p>This is all pretty normal—after all, the electronic Pathfinder Adventures\
  \ game does the same thing. The idea of using cubes to track things, though, seemed\
  \ like a good one, and could be used to solve another problem. On a check that has\
  \ a number of blessings and powers and effects modifying the result, it can be hard\
  \ to remember them all. The answer? Moar cubes!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ \n     <br><i>The good, the bad, and the pretty numbers.</i>\n     <p></p>\n \
  \   </div> \n    <p>Blue buff cubes add to the result, and red debuff cubes are\
  \ evidence of the check getting harder. The \"- hexagon\" red cube subtracts one\
  \ from the check for every die used.</p> \n    <p>These work great, but having a\
  \ little pile of cubes next to a location can be difficult to work with, especially\
  \ if you move the locations around to be closer to the player whose character is\
  \ exploring them. Guess I better make LEGO trays to hold everything!</p> \n    <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180913-A3.jpg\"\

  ></a> \n     <br><i>What else are you going to do with your cubes?</i>\n     <p></p>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>There's a rack on the back to hold the location card, token\
  \ cards for any characters at that location, and if the check to close involves\
  \ facing a henchman, we can keep it there as well. The cubes happen to be the same\
  \ size as a 2x2 brick, so creating slots for them was easy, and there's a brick\
  \ keeping the location deck tipped up to assist in drawing a card.</p> \n    <p>From\
  \ there I started looking at solutions for keeping my character's hand and dice\
  \ contained, since there's only so much table space to go around. That's why I made\
  \ a rack for my cards, and a dice holder.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n\
  \     <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180913-A4.jpg\"><img\

  \ farther down from 'healthy interest' to 'back away slowly'.</i>\n     <p></p>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>The rack is a baseplate sandwich, with my character deck on\
  \ the lower right, discards on the upper right, buried cards on the left, and a\
  \ bonus space on the lower left in case my cards ever need to do some weird thing\
  \ Lone Shark thinks of. Displayed cards can stand up at the back. In that first\
  \ photo you can see the character card I made so you can check things off. And the\
  \ dice holder… holds dice. (By type!)</p> \n    <p>The one thing that I've made\
  \ that I'm the most proud of is this rack for organizing cards that we've dealt\
  \ with during play so I can quickly reset the box after the session.</p> \n    <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180913-A6.jpg\"\

  \ \n     <br><i>Note the red and gold design on the front.</i>\n     <p></p>\n \
  \   </div> \n    <p>The same color changes that affected the cubes go into the rack.\
  \ Location cards go into the brown slot in the back for end-of-scenario clean-up,\
  \ and the white slot is for any Basics or Elites that are about to leave the game.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Finally, the one thing I have to support the game that I treasure the\
  \ most isn't for playing but for storage, and it was created by my husband.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180913-A7.jpg\"\

  \ <br><i>Isn't a roll like this the way everyone carries their tools?</i>\n    \
  \ <p></p>\n    </div> \n    <p>Each type of die gets its own pocket, and so do the\
  \ buff and debuff cubes. The flap at the top folds down over the openings to the\
  \ pockets, and the tie holds everything inside. It puts the finishing touch on packing\
  \ all this gear together into a couple of neat containers so it can all be carried\
  \ or put away with a minimum of fuss.</p> \n    <p>I'm still looking for ways to\
  \ improve or add to what I have. I hope some of this inspires you to trick out your\
  \ game.</p> \n    <p>Darren Rigby</p> \n   </div> \n  </blockquote> <!-- tags: Pathfinder\
