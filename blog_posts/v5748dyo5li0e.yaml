  >In my brief stint handling both development and campaign coordination duties, I've\
  \ had a chance to interact with many of the venture-captains and venture-lieutenants\
  \ while fulfilling convention support requests. One of the most surprising was for\
  \ PbP Gameday IV from Jesse Davis, venture-captain of online play (PbP stands for\
  \ play-by-post, explained more below). To give you a sense of perspective, some\
  \ of our larger regional conventions over the summer run about 120 sessions of the\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfindersociety\">Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild</a>; this\
  \ request had 149 sessions with 81 GMs—and that wasn't counting any of the ones\
  \ who already had their scenario PDFs. I was very excited to share the news of how\
  \ strong the online play community is and the wealth of gaming opportunities available\
  \ for anyone with an internet connection.</p> \n    <p>I'll let Jesse take it from\
  \ there.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>A few weeks ago John mentioned <a href=\"\
  /paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lhvh\">25 great new reasons to attend a convention</a> this\
  \ season. But sometimes—for a variety of reasons—you just can't always attend a\
  \ convention in person. Are you doomed to miss out on those 25 great reasons? Hardly!\
  \ Online Play is here to give you a shot at those prizes and opportunity to play\
  \ those special events without having to leave the comfort of your home.</p> \n\
  \     <p>We have two perfect events coming up to give two great aspects of online\
  \ play a try.</p> \n     <p>The first is the Play-by-Post event starting September\
  \ 19th. <a href=\"/paizo/messageboards/community/campaigns\">Play-by-Post</a> is\
  \ an asynchronous, text-based form of online play that allows for more time to explore\
  \ role-play and story, and it is a terrific way for new GMs and players still learning\
  \ the rules to experience Pathfinder in a slower, more deliberate form of gameplay.\
  \ And for more experienced players, it is a chance to explore roleplaying opportunities\
  \ not always available at a real-time table with a tighter schedule.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>Check out the <a href=\"http://pathfindersocietyonline.com/2015/07/event-pbp-gameday-iv-rise-of-the-siege-of-serpents/\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">PbP Gameday IV event</a> as well as its <a href=\"http://ironhelixx.com/pbpgameday4/\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">list of games</a>. There are over 170 PbP games to choose from,\
  \ including many tables of the interactive Special, <a href=\"/products/btpy9ctz\"\
  >#6–97: Siege of Serpents</a> and the 4-Star exclusive, <a href=\"/products/btpy9cu0\"\
  >#6–98: Serpents Rise</a>.</p> \n     <p>If you are more interested in Real-Time\
  \ Virtual Tabletop play, our next opportunity is <a href=\"http://aethercon.com\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">AetherCon IV</a>, coming up November 13th–15th. AetherCon is\
  \ a terrific online convention offering panels and many games, including panels\
  \ with Paizo staff and other industry favorites, for the low, low price of FREE.\
  \ There will be over a hundred tables of Pathfinder Society Organized Play at AetherCon,\
  \ including the interactive Special <a href=\"/products/btpy9cu7\">#7–00: The Sky\
  \ Key Solution</a> and the 4- and 5-Star exclusives <a href=\"/products/btpy9cu0\"\
  >#6–98: Serpents Rise</a>.and <a href=\"/products/btpy9cu6\">#6–99: True Dragons\
  \ of Absalom</a>. </p> \n     <p>Collectively, there are 300+ tables of roleplaying\
  \ possibility online—and just as many chances to win prizes and boons usually only\
  \ seen at local and regional gaming conventions. So don't miss out! Give online\
  \ play events a try! You don't have to wait for an event to experience the great\
  \ gaming opportunities that online play has to offer; check out the <a href=\"/paizo/messageboards/paizoPublishing/pathfinder/pathfinderSociety/grandLodge/onlinePlay\"\
  >Grand Lodge for Online Play</a> on Paizo.com to find a VTT game that interests\
  \ you, or check out the PbP forums on Paizo.com and get in a game there. We hope\
  \ to see you at a virtual table soon.</p> \n     <p>If you have any questions about\
  \ online play, you can contact the venture-officers for online play at PFSOnlineVOs@GMail.com.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Jesse Davis<br> <i>Venture Captain—Online Play</i></p> \n    </blockquote>\
  \ \n    <p>I'm really excited to see so many opportunities for online play, and\
  \ I encourage you to give both play-by-post and virtual tabletop formats a try.\
  \ Thank you, Jesse, for providing this update.</p> \n    <p>John Compton<br> <i>Developer</i></p>\
