  \ from the playtest laboratory! We are one week in to the Advanced Class Guide Playtest,\
  \ and we are already getting a lot of great feedback and playtest data. Every week\
  \ from now until the playtest's end on December 17th, we are going to be giving\
  \ you our thoughts on the state of the playtest and give you some hints of the direction\
  \ we are taking some of these classes.</span></p> \n    <p>This being the first\
  \ week, we are only just starting to adjust some class mechanics and look at making\
  \ some shifts in how things work. Most of these will take a bit longer to make it\
  \ to your table, but sometime in the next few weeks we are hoping to rerelease the\
  \ playtest PDFs with all of our revisions incorporated into the classes. It is our\
  \ hope to get some feedback on these revisions before the playtest window comes\
  \ to a close. </p>\n    <p>So, without further delay, here are some of the changes\
  \ we are considering or are in the process of implementing. Feel free to comment\
  \ on these changes in the thread attached to this post, but any serious discussion\
  \ should occur in the class thread for each individual class (located in the Class\
  \ forum).</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <h2>Arcanist</h2> \n     <p>As mentioned\
  \ on the boards, the arcanist is going through a serious round of redesign. While\
  \ the core casting mechanic of this class is going to remain pretty much as it currently\
  \ stands, the blood focus ability is being replaced by an arcane reservoir that\
  \ the arcanist to call upon to create magical effects and tinker with the spells\
  \ and effects of others. They can refuel this pool by consuming spell slots or even\
  \ other magic items and spell effects. In essence, the arcanist is becoming the\
  \ \"hacker\" of magic, capable of pulling it apart and putting it back together\
  \ to accomplish their goals. We are hoping to rerelease the arcanist in the next\
  \ few days.</p> \n     <h2>Bloodrager</h2> \n     <p>We are generally happy with\
  \ the direction of this class, but it needs some tweaks. We are seriously contemplating\
  \ giving the class its own spell list to help it better fulfill its role in the\
  \ game. In addition, we are looking at pulling some of the more direct barbarian\
  \ abilities to replace them with something a bit more in tune with the class. Refinement\
  \ of the various bloodlines will be much of our focus, making sure they are in tune\
  \ with the overall balance of the class.</p> \n     <h2>Brawler</h2> \n     <p>The\
  \ brawler is getting a few revisions and tweaks in the coming weeks. The capstone\
  \ ability of the class is going to be replaced with something far more interesting\
  \ than the current ability (although we are not quite ready to show that off just\
  \ yet). The knockout ability will gain a number of uses per day, scaling with level.\
  \ We are also going to change up the brawlers weapon list, giving it all simple\
  \ weapons, plus any weapon on the \"close\" weapon group from the fighter. Of course,\
  \ you will be able to use all those weapons with the brawler's flurry ability.</p>\
  \ \n     <h2>Hunter</h2> \n     <p>We are looking at a lot of different options\
  \ for the hunter, the biggest of which is giving a boost to the hunter's animal\
  \ companion. We really want to see the class working in tandem with its companion\
  \ in a way that we just have not done with any other class. We are looking at buffing\
  \ up the hunter's ranged capabilities as well. Expect to see a number of teamwork\
  \ feats in the final book that work specifically with an animal companion as well.\
  \ Of course we are looking at a few other issues as well, such as the restrictions\
  \ on armor and shields and increasing the duration and use of the animal focus ability.</p>\
  \ \n     <h2>Investigator</h2> \n     <p>The design team is looking to move this\
  \ class a little bit away from the rogue, possibly by replacing sneak attack with\
  \ an ability that is more in line with the theme of the class. We are also looking\
  \ into changing the poison use ability to make it something that allows the investigator\
  \ to identify poisons, their effects, and neutralize them. Finally, there are going\
  \ to be more talents allowing them to use more of their skills as well as some new\
  \ effects we are not quite ready to talk about just yet.</p> \n     <h2>Shaman</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>Overall, we are pretty happy with the direction the shaman is taking,\
  \ but there are some adjustments we are investigating. The first of which is changing\
  \ the class to work off the druid spell list, as this fits the theme better than\
  \ the witch or cleric list. In addition, we are looking into adding a bit more the\
  \ hexes for each spirit and possibly adjusting how those hexes are used.</p> \n\
  \     <h2>Skald</h2> \n     <p>The biggest change on the horizon with the skald\
  \ involves how the raging song is used in play, allowing characters to drop out\
  \ of participating if they want. We are also looking at making the raging song work\
  \ in tandem with other rage abilities in a limited way. In addition, we are thinking\
  \ about adding a number of weapon proficiencies to the class to bring it a bit closer\
  \ to its theme.</p> \n     <h2>Slayer</h2> \n     <p>We are looking at ways to make\
  \ favored target a bit easier to use and a bit more versatile. We are also looking\
  \ at bringing the class up to 6 skill ranks per level (it currently has 4 per level).\
  \ Other than that, most of our upcoming revisions involve greatly expanding the\
  \ number of talents that you can choose from, allowing you to build the slayer you\
  \ want to play.</p> \n     <h2>Swashbuckler</h2> \n     <p>We are investigating\
  \ ways for the class to get Weapon Finesse at an appropriate level and to work with\
  \ Combat Expertise. In addition, we are looking at adding some deeds and increase\
  \ the swashbucklers mobility during battle, allowing them to stand up without provoking\
  \ an attack and charge without having to move in a straight line. We are still working\
  \ on how those play with existing deeds and what changes would need to happen to\
  \ get them to fit into the advancement scheme.</p> \n     <h2>Warpriest</h2> \n\
  \     <p>Finally we get to the warpriest. We are looking at strengthening the role\
  \ of this class by taking it a bit away from the cleric's position. While we want\
  \ the class to be among the best at healing and casting spells on itself and we\
  \ are investigating a mechanic to let it do just that (probably in place of channel\
  \ energy). We are also looking into a new class feature that allows the warpriest\
  \ to be an effective combatant with the favored weapon of its deity, regardless\
  \ of what weapon is favored by their deity. Look for increased damage and additional\
  \ effects depending on the type of weapon and its role in the game.</p> \n    </blockquote>\
  \ \n    <p>Well, that about wraps up the playtest review for this week. We want\
  \ to thank everyone who has taken the time to give us their thoughts and playtest\
  \ reports. You are helping us make these classes great and we appreciate all the\
  \ time you are spending giving us your feedback. Look for the revised arcanist in\
  \ a blog post later this week and expect to see a revised version of the playtest\
  \ document soon. </p> \n    <p>Jason Bulmahn<br> <i>Lead Designer</i></p> \n   </div>\
