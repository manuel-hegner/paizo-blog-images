  > \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">The start of the <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lg7j\"\
  >Year of the Sky Key</a> has spawned many questions thanks to the faction changes,\
  \ the release of the <a href=\"/products/btpy978v\"><i>Advanced Class Guide</i></a>,\
  \ and the use of <a href=\"/products/btpy98i0\"><i>Technology Guide</i></a>. In\
  \ preparation for today's blog, I compiled my list of known questions, polled venture-officers\
  \ about unanswered questions still at large on the messageboards, filtered out the\
  \ ones that weren't specific to the organized play campaign (saved to pass along\
  \ to their associated designers and developers), and wrote out answers and updates\
  \ to everything that was left.</span></p> \n    <h2>Warpriest Retraining</h2> \n\
  \    <blockquote> \n     <p><b>Are playtest warpriests able to adjust their ability\
  \ scores based on the fervor class ability's new dependence on Wisdom?</b><br> Yes,\
  \ page 28 of the <a href=\"/products/btpy84k4\"><i>Guide to Pathfinder Society Organized\
  \ Play</i></a> states that \"if a class, prestige class or class feature-dependent\
  \ ability score is altered,\" the character qualifies for a rebuild, maintaining\
  \ the same equipment. That means a character's class choices, feats, skill ranks,\
  \ spells known, et cetera can change.</p> \n     <p><b>Are playtest warpriests able\
  \ to adjust character features tied to these ability scores (e.g. losing ranks in\
  \ Diplomacy to instead put them in Sense Motive)?</b><br> Yes, see above.</p> \n\
  \     <p><b>Are playtest warpriests able to alter any other character choices/options\
  \ (e.g. feats) as part of any rebuilding process?</b><br> Yes, see above.</p> \n\
  \     <p><b>Are playtest warpriests able to take archetypes as part of any rebuilding\
  \ process?</b><br> Yes, see above.</p> \n     <p><b>What are the warpriest's retraining\
  \ synergies (as per <a href=\"/products/btpy8x64\"><i>Ultimate Campaign's</i></a>\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/prd/ultimateCampaign/campaignSystems/retraining.html\"\
  >retraining rules</a> on page 190)?</b><br> In Pathfinder Society Organized Play,\
  \ determine the retraining synergies for the <i>Advanced Class Guide</i> classes\
  \ by substituting one class name for an existing class on the table. For example,\
  \ an arcanist has the same retraining synergies as a wizard, and any class that\
  \ lists the wizard as a retraining synergy also has the arcanist as a retraining\
  \ synergy.</p> \n     <ul>\n      <li>Substitute the term \"arcanist\" anywhere\
  \ the term \"wizard\" appears.</li> \n      <li>Substitute the term \"bloodrager\"\
  \ anywhere the term \"barbarian\" appears. Bloodragers have retraining synergy with\
  \ sorcerers and vice versa.</li> \n      <li>Substitute the term \"brawler\" anywhere\
  \ the term \"fighter\" appears.</li> \n      <li>Substitute the term \"hunter\"\
  \ anywhere the term \"ranger\" appears.</li> \n      <li>Substitute the term \"\
  investigator\" anywhere the term \"alchemist\" appears.</li> \n      <li>Substitute\
  \ the term \"shaman\" anywhere the term \"druid\" appears.</li> \n      <li>Substitute\
  \ the term \"skald\" anywhere the term \"bard\" appears. Skalds have retraining\
  \ synergy with barbarians and vice versa.</li> \n      <li>Substitute the term \"\
  slayer\" anywhere the term \"ranger\" appears. Slayers have retraining synergy with\
  \ rogues and vice versa.</li> \n      <li>Substitute the term \"swashbuckler\" anywhere\
  \ the term \"fighter\" appears.</li> \n      <li>Substitute the term \"warpriest\"\
  \ anywhere the term \"paladin\" appears.</li>\n     </ul> \n     <p><b>What is the\
  \ intended interaction between the <i>Guide's</i> and the Additional Resources'\
  \ entries about retraining for the warpriest? Should one or both be revised based\
  \ on any of the above rulings?</b><br> The <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/about/additionalResources\"\
  >Additional Resources page</a> and <i>Guide to Pathfinder Society Organized Play</i>\
  \ principally conflict regarding warpriest retraining, as no other class's associated\
  \ ability scores changed between the playtest and final versions of the classes.\
  \ The Additional Resources page's wording in an important reminder that most classes\
  \ and most characters do not qualify for comprehensive rebuilds based on the final\
  \ version of the <i>Advanced Class Guide</i>.</p> \n     <p><b>During the playtest,\
  \ the shaman's spell list had access to summon nature's ally. Is there any rebuilding\
  \ allowed for those who selected character options that modify summoning such as\
  \ Augment Summoning?</b><br> Shaman characters that selected character options that\
  \ modify summoning abilities they no longer possess may retrain those features and\
  \ any immediate prerequisites for those features. For example, such a shaman could\
  \ retrain Augment Summoning, Superior Summoning, and Spell Focus (conjuration),\
  \ but not Spell Penetration, Combat Casting, or Improved Initiative. A character\
  \ can sell back any items that specifically modify summoning abilities, use <i>summon\
  \ nature's ally</i>, or use <i>summon monster</i> (such as scrolls).</p> \n    </blockquote>\
  \ \n    <h2>Faction Changes</h2> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><b>Does one automatically\
  \ switch to the successor faction, or is that treated as the one faction change\
  \ per season?</b><br> The change to a successor faction is automatic and does not\
  \ count as the one free faction change. If your character was a member of the Cheliax\
  \ faction, she is now part of the Dark Archives faction for free. Try out a scenario\
  \ as part of that faction, then decide if you want to stick with it or use the free\
  \ change.</p> \n     <p><b>When the five nation-based factions (Andoran, Cheliax,\
  \ Osirion, Qadira, and Taldor) changed into ideological factions, how many faction-specific\
  \ features and rewards could a PC retain?</b><br> As noted on pages 17-18 of the\
  \ <i>Guide to Pathfinder Society Organized Play</i>, a member of a retiring faction\
  \ retains \"any faction-specific vanities, titles, traits, prestige items, or other\
  \ purchases made while the character was a member of the retired faction.\" As a\
  \ result, a Cheliax faction PC who purchased the Hellknight prestige award would\
  \ retain it no matter which faction she ended up joining at the start of Season\
  \ 6.</p> \n     <p><b>Do I also keep any of the faction-specific boons earned on\
  \ Season 5 Chronicle sheets?</b><br> Yes, you keep any of these boons that you earned\
  \ during Season 5. However, remember that you might not qualify for other faction-specific\
  \ boons from that faction once you have switched allegiances; page 18 of the <i>Guide\
  \ to Pathfinder Society Organized Play</i> covers which current factions correspond\
  \ to earlier nation-based factions for the purposes of earning these rewards.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>Is a character benefiting from The Risen faction prestige award required\
  \ to stay with the Scarab Sages faction as the natural evolution of the Osirion\
  \ faction?</b><br> This is a special case, given the enduring consequences of purchasing\
  \ that particular prestige award. A character who possessed this prestige award\
  \ prior to August 14th, 2014 does not qualify for the free faction change. He can,\
  \ however, pay 3 Prestige Points per character level to change factions, as described\
  \ on page 17 of the <i>Guide to Pathfinder Society Organized Play</i>. A member\
  \ of the Scarab Sages faction who acquires The Risen prestige award [on or after\
  \ August 14th, 2014] is bound to that faction and cannot change factions.</p> \n\
  \    </blockquote> \n    <h2>Technology Guide</h2> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><b>Is\
  \ the Technologist feat in <i>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Technology Guide</i>\
  \ required to attempt any skill checks regarding technology?</b><br> The following\
  \ text will appear in an updated version of the <i>Guide to Pathfinder Society Organized\
  \ Play</i>:<br> \"The otherworldly technology associated with Numeria is very different\
  \ from the rest of the technology available on Golarion,and so far advanced that\
  \ any comprehensive understanding requires the Technologist feat (<i>Pathfinder\
  \ Campaign Setting: Technology Guide</i> 7). However, scenarios that include Numerian\
  \ technology are designed in a way that characters with the Technologist feat have\
  \ an advantage, yet those without are still able to succeed at the mission. Clever\
  \ Pathfinders might operate a device by trial and error, infer a device's use by\
  \ its placement (such as a keypad on a door acting as a lock), or draw logical if\
  \ crude associations between known items and Numerian technology (such as a laser\
  \ pistol having the same shape and features as a hand crossbow or Alkenstar firearm).\"\
  </p> \n     <p><b>How does hardness work for creatures? Does energy damage such\
  \ as cold deal half damage to creatures with hardness (<i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i>\
  \ 173-174) even before applying the flat numerical reduction?</b><br> When a creature\
  \ with hardness sustains damage, subtract its hardness from the damage dealt. The\
  \ rules for halving damage, doubling damage, dealing damage with ineffective tools,\
  \ immunities, and the like only apply to damaging inanimate objects.<br> <i>(This\
  \ is apparently a question the Design Team has received a few times during the development\
  \ of <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/ironGods\">Iron Gods</a>, so they were\
  \ ready to go with an answer!)</i></p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <h2>Miscellaneous</h2>\
  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><b>Investigators have an alchemy class ability similar\
  \ to that of an alchemist. Are investigators also able to craft alchemical items\
  \ in Pathfinder Society Organized Play?</b><br> Investigators are able to craft\
  \ alchemical items and poisons as if they were alchemists. This information will\
  \ appear in an upcoming update to the Pathfinder Society FAQ, both in the poisons\
  \ section (which will also include the investigator's poison lore class ability)\
  \ and the alchemist crafting section.</p> \n     <p><b>I received a ratfolk or samsaran\
  \ race boon for volunteering at a recent convention, but the Additional Resources\
  \ page still says that ratfolk and samsaran options in <a href=\"/products/btpy8rv2\"\
  ><i>Advanced Race Guide</i></a> are not legal for play. Is this ever going to change?</b><br>\
  \ All ratfolk and samsaran alternate racial traits, favored class bonuses, archetypes,\
  \ equipment, feats, and spells are legal for play. Note that most of these options\
  \ are limited to ratfolk and samsaran characters respectively following the Advanced\
  \ Race Guide entry's second paragraph on the Additional Resources page. The next\
  \ Additional Resources update is set to revise the entry.</p> \n     <p><b>What\
  \ deities can a warpriest worship? The Additional Resources page suggests that only\
  \ the core 20 deities are legal choices.</b><br> This is not the intended interpretation,\
  \ and the next Additional Resources update is set to revise the entry to read as\
  \ follows. \"To select a blessing, a warpriest must worship a deity that offers\
  \ the domain of the same name.\" A warpriest in the organized play campaign is able\
  \ to select from among any of the legal deity choices.</p> \n     <p><b>Can one\
  \ purchase a ring of eloquence (<a href=\"/products/btpy978v\"><i>Pathfinder RPG\
  \ Advanced Class Guide</i></a> 216) with any combination of languages? Are restricted\
  \ or banned languages such as Druidic or Androffan options?</b><br> At this time,\
  \ only two configurations of the ring of eloquence exist in the organized play campaign.\
  \ The first grants the ability to speak and understand Common, Dwarven, Elven, and\
  \ Gnome. The second grants the ability to speak and understand Giant, Goblin, Orc,\
  \ and Undercommon. Rings with other configurations may appear as treasure on Chronicle\
  \ sheets.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>John Compton<br> <i>Developer</i></p>\
