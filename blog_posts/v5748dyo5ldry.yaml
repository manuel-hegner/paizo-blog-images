  \ it lifted Merisiel off the ground, crushing her in its mighty clawed fist. The\
  \ elf struggled to free herself, but to no effect—the devil’s grasp was just too\
  \ strong.</i></p> \n     <p><i>Brandishing a glowing longsword blessed by the gods,\
  \ Valeros crept up behind the fiend, scrambling up a ridge of burning brimstone.\
  \ With a grunt, the warrior leapt from the rock, bringing his holy blade down upon\
  \ the devil with all the strength he could muster. The sword sliced through the\
  \ devil’s arm, cleaving nearly to the bone, forcing the fiend to drop Merisiel and\
  \ turning its roar of triumph into a howl of pain.</i></p> \n     <p><i>“Sorry it\
  \ took me so long to save you,” Valeros remarked with a grin. “I was distracted\
  \ by the mountain of treasure over there”.</i></p>\n    </blockquote> \n    <p><span\

  \ releases in just a few days at Gen Con! For our final preview of this gigantic\
  \ tome of gear and magic items, our heroes are facing off against a terrible CR\
  \ 20 pit fiend. While that’s certainly a tough fight, it also comes with a huge\
  \ pile of loot!</span></p> \n    <p>Due to their varied nature, outsiders can possess\
  \ treasure of any type, and this pit fiend has 200,000 gp worth of treasure to hand\
  \ out. In addition to the mountain of more common loot, this is also a good time\
  \ to look at some of the items you can’t get through one of the random tables—in\
  \ this case, artifacts. In addition to the treasure from the tables, this pit fiend\
  \ is also guarding a terrible artifact called the skullsoul, an object that Valeros\
  \ and Merisiel are no doubt trying to destroy.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><b>Treasure\
  \ Type F: Combatant Gear<br> 100,000 gp Reward (total value 99,235 gp)</b><br> <i>celestial\
  \ armor, +1 nullifying bastard sword, ring of foe focus, ring of counterspells,\
  \ figurine of wondrous power (</i>gold lions<i>), void pennant</i></p> \n     <p><b>Treasure\
  \ Type G: Spellcaster Gear<br> 100,000 gp Reward (total value 101,125 gp)</b><br>\
  \ <i>ring of return, grounding rod, heretic’s bane, scroll of resurrection, wand\
  \ of pain strike</i></p> \n     <p><b>Artifact</b><br> <i>skullsoul</i></p> \n \
  \   </blockquote> \n    <p>Now that’s a pile of magic items that might be worth\
  \ braving the depths of hell for! Of course, they might end up using up some of\
  \ the treasure to recover from their encounter with the pit fiend (I’m thinking\
  \ that scroll of resurrection seems like it might see some use). There are so many\
  \ new items in this pile, I can’t even show off every spread that contains them.\
  \ I guess you’ll just have to check them out yourself in a few days.</p> \n    <p>Well,\
  \ that brings to a close the final preview of <a href=\"/products/btpy8rcd\"><i>Ultimate\
  \ Equipment</i></a>. We hope you like what you saw. This book is due to be hitting\
  \ bookshelves and the mailboxes of subscribers any day now! If you’re planning on\
  \ attending Gencon, we’ll have a huge pile of the books ready for all of your equipment\
  \ needs first thing on Thursday...</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a\
