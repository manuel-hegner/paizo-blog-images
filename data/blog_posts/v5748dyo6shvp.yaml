  \ \n     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Over the last six weeks,\
  \ Paizo's Leadership Team has attempted to better listen to and understand the challenges\
  \ faced by its workforce, customers, and community. We want to take a moment to\
  \ update you on a few important developments that have emerged from those conversations.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Before we begin, it's important to note that this update does not address\
  \ requests regarding salaries, adjustments to the current work-from-home environment,\
  \ or other matters that are now subject to negotiation with the United Paizo Workers\
  \ union during collective bargaining.</p> \n      <p>We’re still searching diligently\
  \ for a candidate to fill the company’s Human Resources Manager position, and plan\
  \ to begin interviews very shortly. As this is an incredibly important hire, we\
  \ want to make sure we find the right candidate with experience leading initiatives\
  \ related to Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging (DEIB) and working with\
  \ a union. We are continuing to gather resumes as the search continues.</p> \n \
  \     <p>We’ve hired a company called <a href=\"https://www.energage.com/\" target=\"\
  _blank\">Energage</a> to complete an employee engagement survey on behalf of Paizo.\
  \ This survey is designed to allow employees to provide anonymous, unfiltered, and\
  \ honest feedback to the company that will help Paizo establish priorities for improvement\
  \ planning. It will also serve as an important benchmark against which to measure\
  \ the results of future surveys, allowing us to develop a baseline to measure against.\
  \ We expect employees to be able to access the engagement survey sometime this week.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Discussion in the past several months has resurfaced two instances\
  \ in which a Paizo executive mishandled user data when replying to message board\
  \ posts, resulting in allegations of doxxing. These actions were contrary to Paizo\
  \ policy, and corrective actions were taken to ensure that this does not happen\
  \ again.</p> \n      <p>“This was a huge mistake on my part and I am deeply sorry\
  \ for any issues that have arisen from these actions. This was not the right way\
  \ to treat our customers and I apologize,” said Paizo President Jeff Alvarez. “\
  As President, I know I need to hold myself to a higher standard.”</p> \n      <p>Paizo\
  \ takes issues related to discrimination and harassment very seriously. We have\
  \ hired the law firm of <a href=\"https://www.moritthock.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\
  >Moritt Hock &amp; Hamroff</a> (MH&amp;H) to investigate allegations of discrimination\
  \ against trans employees and sexual misconduct before reporting back to the Leadership\
  \ Team. Investigators from the firm will reach out to members of Paizo’s staff and\
  \ others that made claims on social media. Cooperation with the firm is voluntary,\
  \ of course, but we remain committed to investigating these matters thoroughly to\
  \ ensure a safe and respectful workplace.</p> \n      <p>We chose MH&amp;H upon\
  \ the recommendation of a consultant with expertise in matters of DEIB. MH&amp;H\
  \ has a team of attorneys that specialize in these issues, and we’re confident they’\
  ll be able to provide an impartial analysis of the facts that we need to move forward\
  \ with any corrective actions.</p> \n      <p>Because the results of these investigations\
  \ are private personnel matters, Paizo will not be able to make them public. Corrective\
  \ actions will be taken against any employee (including managers and executives)\
  \ found to be guilty of these allegations. </p> \n      <p>It has never been Paizo’\
  s intention to discriminate against any employee when making decisions of who to\
  \ send to industry trade shows, but we see now that our room-sharing policy was\
  \ based on outdated interpretations of gender, was not friendly to transgender employees,\
  \ and could contribute to a perception of transphobia at the company. Paizo’s Leadership\
  \ Team acknowledges the pain this caused, and we understand that we need to be better\
  \ at recognizing issues where such decisions could have unintended results. We also\
  \ recognize that such actions do not align with Paizo's core values, the values\
  \ of its staff members, or the sentiments of diversity and inclusion expressed in\
  \ Paizo products, and as such, have disappointed, angered, and confused members\
  \ of our community. We believe these mistakes are not representative of who we are,\
  \ or what we want the company to represent. We need to do better... and we will.\
  \ </p> \n      <p>“As the person in charge of trade shows, I want to apologize to\
  \ anyone that felt marginalized as a result of the convention decision-making process,”\
  \ said Jeff Alvarez. “It was not our intent to discriminate against anyone, and\
  \ I’m sorry.”</p> \n      <p>As previously communicated, Paizo has adopted a one-employee-per-room\
  \ travel policy moving forward. Regardless of gender identity, couples will be allowed\
  \ to share rooms during travel as long as both parties request it. </p> \n     \
  \ <p>Paizo remains committed to maintaining a diverse, safe, and fun workplace where\
  \ our employees are treated fairly and look forward to creating awesome Pathfinder\
  \ and Starfinder products for many years to come. We hope that this update helps\
  \ communicate that we, the Leadership Team, are doing our best to listen to and\
  \ address the concerns of our community members. We believe in creating a better\
  \ Paizo, and believe that transparency, communication, and accountability will be\
  \ instrumental as we move forward. Thank you for your continued support of our company\
  \ and our products.</p> \n      <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold;\
