  \     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Greetings, Starfinders! The\
  \ launch of the Year of Redemption’s Rise is less than a month away, and we hope\
  \ you’re all excited. Jessica and I are here today to talk about some of the new\
  \ rule changes taking effect on May 27th, when Year 5 launches at PaizoCon. Our\
  \ transition to Achievement Points last year was a big shift, so this year we’re\
  \ keeping things simple.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/2ee778e0-8aca-40bc-b76d-cd855cb32dfd/SFS_Year5Launch_Banner2000.png\"\

  \     </div> \n      <br> \n      <h3>New Species</h3> \n      <p>With the advent\
  \ of our new year, we have five species moving to the Always Available list! As\
  \ of May 27, players may create as many <b>dragonkin</b>, <b>pahtra</b>, <b>sarcesian</b>,\
  \ <b>shobhad</b>, and <b>vlaka</b> characters as they like. As outlined in the <a\
  \ href=\"https://paizo.com/starfindersociety/faq#admittance-boon-always-available\"\
  >Starfinder Society FAQ</a>, any admittance boon for these species can then be used\
  \ as “Existing Character” boons to gain a boost to certain stats. The boons in the\
  \ Achievement Points system have been updated to reflect this option, and you can\
  \ download an updated copy now. These boons cannot be purchased after May 27.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Dragonkin characters have the following additional rule:<br> When you\
  \ create a dragonkin character, you must select another player’s character to form\
  \ your partner bond with. Mark down that character’s Organized Play number on your\
  \ character sheet. If that character is permanently slain, then you can select a\
  \ new partner bond by marking a new Organized Play number on your character sheet\
  \ between sessions.</p> \n      <h3>New Factions</h3> \n      <p>Three new factions\
  \ have risen to prominence this year as well. The <b>Advocates</b>, <b>Cognates</b>\
  \ and <b>Manifold Host</b> factions can be selected by all characters once Year\
  \ 5 launches. No further boon purchases are required to champion any of these factions.\
  \ Previous members of the Manifold Host faction now enjoy an expanded slate of boons\
  \ and have early access to higher-tier boons by virtue of their time spent bringing\
  \ the faction to prominence.</p> \n      <h3>Raise Dead</h3> \n      <p>This update\
  \ isn’t tied to Year 5 specifically, but I figured this was as good a place as any\
  \ to mention it. Recently, some of our volunteers pointed out that in the move to\
  \ Achievement Points, the Raise Dead boon for the Starfinder Society required players\
  \ to pay both AcP and credits to resurrect their character. As the Fame boon never\
  \ required the extra credit expenditure, this was clearly an error somewhere along\
  \ the line, and we apologize for it. The boon has been updated to remove this clause,\
  \ and if anybody did spend credits on the boon, you may restore those credits on\
  \ your next Chronicle Sheet. Thanks to those who pointed out this error!</p> \n\
  \      <p>Now, I’ll turn it over to Jessica for some more previews of upcoming boons\
  \ for Year 5. Take it away!</p> \n      <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight:\

  \ \n      <br> \n      <h3>New Boons</h3> \n      <p>Hello, fellow Starfinders!\
  \  </p>\n      <p>Over the past few weeks, we’ve shared previews of our three minor\
  \ factions: the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shzj?Starfinder-Society-Faction-Preview-The-Advocates\"\
  >Advocates</a>, <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6si0a\">Cognates</a>,\
  \ and <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6si0k\">Manifold Host</a>.\
  \ While the Advocates and Cognates are launching with a complete slate of boons,\
  \ the Manifold Host is receiving a few new boons to round out their already existing\
  \ boon selection. However, our minor factions aren’t the only factions receiving\
  \ new boons this coming year! All three of our Second Seekers factions are receiving\
  \ two new boons, and today we’re revealing three of them! This increase brings them\
  \ in line with our other major factions. Note that these boons aren’t final yet\
  \ and may change slightly before release.</p> \n      <h3>Second Seekers (Ehu Hadif)</h3>\
  \ \n      <p><b>Expert Scanner (Starship Boon):</b><br> You believe information\
  \ and preparation are integral to a Starfinder’s success and have learned a few\
  \ tricks to get the most out of your starship’s sensors. When you utilize a starship’\
  s sensors, you increase the modifier granted by those sensors by 2. This doesn’\
  t increase the range of those sensors. For example, if you’re on a starship with\
  \ basic short-range sensors, you treat the sensors as having a +4 modifier, rather\
  \ than a +2 modifier.</p> \n      <p><b>Special</b>: A starship can benefit from\
  \ only one copy of this Starship boon at a time.<br> <b>Other Notes</b>: 15+ Reputation\
  \ with Second Seekers (Ehu Hadif)<br> <b>AcP Cost</b>: 4</p> \n      <h3>Second\
  \ Seekers (Jadnura)</h3> \n      <p><b>Reflective Meditation (Slotless Boon):</b><br>\
  \ You’ve taken Jadnura’s lessons to heart and have spent a great deal of time contemplating\
  \ your place in the universe and within the Starfinder Society. Once per scenario,\
  \ you can spend 1 Resolve Point to meditate on your current course for 10 minutes.\
  \ When you do so, select mind or matter. If you select mind, for the duration of\
  \ the next combat encounter, you gain a +1 bonus to saving throws. If you select\
  \ matter, for the duration of the next combat encounter, you gain a +1 bonus to\
  \ AC.</p> \n      <p><b>Other Notes</b>: 5+ Reputation with Second Seekers (Jadnura)<br>\
  \ <b>AcP Cost</b>: 4</p> \n      <h3>Second Seekers (Luwazi Elsebo)</h3> \n    \
  \  <p><b>Experienced Diplomat (Slotless Boon):</b><br> Your time with Luwazi Elsebo\
  \ has taught you how to juggle the needs of disparate parties and smooth over diplomatic\
  \ missteps. Once per adventure, when you would fail at a Diplomacy check that’s\
  \ written into the adventure, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to reroll that Diplomacy\
  \ check. You must use the second result.</p> \n      <p><b>Other Notes</b>: 15+\
  \ Reputation with Second Seekers (Luwazi Elsebo)<br> <b>AcP Cost</b>: 4</p> \n \
  \     <p>That’s all for now, Starfinders! I hope you join us as we launch into the\
  \ Year of Redemption’s Rise!</p> \n      <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight:\
