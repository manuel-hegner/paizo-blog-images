  \ Lineup for the Emerald Spire Announced</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Thursday,\
  \ December 13, 2012</p> \n    <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n     <p>Dear Friends\
  \ of Paizo,</p> \n     <p><span itemprop=\"description\">First off, I want to thank\
  \ you for your support of Paizo through this, our 10th anniversary year. It has\
  \ been a year of reflection, a year of celebration, and a year of exciting new projects!\
  \ I am blessed to have an incredible team here at Paizo that I enjoy working with\
  \ on a daily basis. I am equally blessed with such a super group of fellow gaming\
  \ enthusiasts that I can call my friends and customers. As Conan would say, life\
  \ is good!</span></p> \n     <p>As many of you know, we have a Kickstarter going\
  \ that will help our sister company, <a href=\"http://goblinworks.com\">Goblinworks</a>,\
  \ make the Pathfinder Online MMO. This game has me excited because it will be the\
  \ first time that anyone will be able to visually immerse themselves into the world\
  \ of Golarion and to see what it would be like to actually live in this campaign\
  \ world that we have only seen through the words of our incredible authors, the\
  \ pictures of our amazing artists, and the imaginations of our own brains. I can\
  \ tell you that when I actually was able to take Merisiel and run her through the\
  \ wilderness outside of Thornkeep in the River Kingdoms the other day, I was trembling\
  \ with excitement! Pathfinder Online is the type of game that I can really get excited\
  \ about because it doesn't just lead you through a scripted Pathfinder experience,\
  \ it allows YOU to shape the experience just like you do in our real world. It reminds\
  \ me so much of my 30 years of playing tabletop RPGs—I get to decide what happens\
  \ in my campaigns. That, to me, is very exciting!</p> \n     <p>The <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1675907842/pathfinder-online-a-fantasy-sandbox-mmo\"\
  >Pathfinder Online Kickstarter</a> has been up for two weeks and I'm pleased to\
  \ announce that yesterday we reached the $300,000 sub-goal: 30% off the way towards\
  \ our final goal! Statistics have shown Kickstarters that reach the 30% mark have\
  \ a 90% chance of success. It means that early supporters came in and the project\
  \ is on a good track to go all the way. However, we still need a ton of support\
  \ if we are going to make our goal and see Pathfinder Online become a reality. That\
  \ means we need your help! Of course, we don't intend to just ask for your help\
  \ without giving you a little something in return. We've added some tasty morsels\
  \ to the Kickstarter by way of new reward tiers, some cool add-on products, and\
  \ some additional value for the already announced tiers.</p> \n     <p>The biggest\
  \ announcement this past week was for the <i>Emerald Spire Superdungeon</i>, a Pathfinder\
  \ RPG product that could become the largest official Pathfinder dungeon ever created!\
  \ We have enlisted a massive number of superstar RPG designers to each pen their\
  \ own unique dungeon level in the Emerald Spire. As the Kickstarter pledges grow,\
  \ so does the dungeon! This superdungeon will be available in both print and PDF,\
  \ and there are numerous options to support us that will get you this cool collaboration\
  \ of RPG legends!</p> \n     <p>I'm super excited to announce today the all-star\
  \ lineup for the first 12 levels of the <i>Emerald Spire Superdungeon</i>. They\
  \ are:</p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p><b>Rich Baker</b> (author of the Birthright\
  \ campaign setting for D&amp;D)<br> <b>Wolfgang Baur</b> (CEO of Open Design, and\
  \ legendary TSR designer)<br> <b>F. Wesley Schneider</b> (Paizo Editor-In-Chief\
  \ and creator of Ustalav)<br> <b>James Sutter</b> (Paizo Fiction Editor and creator\
  \ of Kaer Maga)<br> <b>Lisa Stevens</b> (CEO of Paizo, and co-founder of White Wolf\
  \ and Wizards of the Coast)<br> <b>Keith Baker</b> (Creator of the Eberron campaign\
  \ setting for D&amp;D)<br> <b>Ed Greenwood</b> (Creator of the Forgotten Realms\
  \ campaign setting for D&amp;D)<br> <b>Erik Mona</b> (Publisher and co-creator of\
  \ the Pathfinder Campaign Setting)<br> <b>Mark Rein-Hagen</b> (Co-founder of White\
  \ Wolf Publishing, author of <i>Ars Magica, Vampire: The Masquerade, Werewolf: The\
  \ Apocalypse, Wraith: The Oblivion,</i> and <i>Changeling: The Dreaming</i>)<br>\
  \ <b>Jason Bulmahn</b> (Lead designer of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game and co-creator\
  \ of the Pathfinder Campaign Setting)<br> <b>Frank Mentzer</b> (Founder of the RPGA,\
  \ co-author of The Temple of Elemental Evil, author of D&amp;D boxed sets)<br> <b>James\
  \ Jacobs</b> (Creative Director and creator of the Pathfinder Adventure Path and\
  \ Varisia)</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>These folks have been my heroes, my\
  \ co-workers, and my friends in the industry. They have created the products that\
  \ have defined my 25 years in this industry and I am extremely proud to have them\
  \ working with me to create the most amazing superdungeon ever! The very cool thing\
  \ is that this baby can grow bigger if enough people back this Kickstarter. We have\
  \ another dozen or so amazing authors waiting in the wings should we need to call\
  \ on their services to add additional levels. How low do you want the dungeon to\
  \ go? Back this Kickstarter and tell us!</p> \n     <p>In addition, our friends\
  \ at WizKids have worked with us to create some prepainted plastic minis for this\
  \ Kickstarter campaign! The Bloodbriar Goblin and the Shadowfire Elemental have\
  \ already been unlocked, and we're on our way to unlocking the Lava Lurker. These\
  \ minis have been added to the reward package for everyone at the Crowdforger Pioneer\
  \ level and higher. There are more minis waiting to be unlocked as we head towards\
  \ our funding goal, giving backers a minimum of nine cool new minis if this Kickstarter\
  \ campaign is funded!</p> \n     <p>For our Pathfinder Society friends out there,\
  \ we have added a new reward level that will get you a very cool boon that you can\
  \ use in Pathfinder Society play! Erik, Mike and Mark have pulled out all the stops\
  \ in making this the coolest Pathfinder Society boon I have ever seen! Check out\
  \ the Kickstarter page to learn more!</p> \n     <p>Now is a great time to help\
  \ us spread the word about this Kickstarter. The more people hear about us, the\
  \ more momentum we gather, and the bigger rewards get for Kickstarter backers and\
  \ Pathfinder fans! Here's how you can help:</p> \n     <ol>\n      <li>Pledge to\
  \ support the Kickstarter! Even if you don't play computer games, there are plenty\
  \ of awesome rewards to add to your tabletop Pathfinder game.</li> \n      <li>Share\
  \ the Kickstarter link with your buddies on Facebook, Google+ and Twitter.</li>\
  \ \n      <li>Check the Pathfinder Online Kickstarter page every day to watch the\
  \ newest videos and learn about the latest reward reveals!</li>\n     </ol> \n \
  \    <p>In closing, thanks again for making Paizo your gaming company of choice.\
  \ If it weren't for you and your patronage, Paizo wouldn't be heading into year\
  \ eleven. It truly means the world to me and my staff. Have a wonderful holiday\
  \ season—I look forward to sharing so many new adventures in 2013!</p> \n     <p>Lisa\
