  \   </div> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">They’d landed on\
  \ a port moon to rehaul their ship before rendezvousing with the rest of the Pact\
  \ World diplomatic team on a newly discovered world called Sigerro. A routine enough\
  \ stop, but then, even in Near Space, the routine could quickly turn to excitement.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Zemir and Raia, part of the command team, were sent to find upgraded\
  \ Drift drives for their ship. The thought was that Raia’s eye for tech would aid\
  \ in finding the best equipment and Zemir’s tendency to bend chance might allow\
  \ them to purchase it at a low price. </p> \n     <p>The technomancer and witchwarper\
  \ debated the differences between their respective talents while perusing the port’\
  s open-air markets. </p> \n     <p>“Our methods differ only in scope. You use your\
  \ gifts to push technology,” said Zemir, tossing another faulty circuit board into\
  \ a display case, “whereas I use mine to push reality.”</p> \n     <p>“Your scope\
  \ may be wider,” said Raia, examining some drive schematics absently. “But my tech\
  \ produces more reliable results.”</p> \n     <p>“Reliability is irrelevant. In\
  \ the end, we seek the same thing—the new, impossible, the interesting. Is how we\
  \ do it so important?”</p> \n     <p>“Some would say the ‘how’ is the most important\
  \ part of all,” Raia answered, smiling. It was an old debate between friends, one\
  \ they’d cheerfully had over drinks in many a space port. </p> \n     <p>“Perhaps\
  \ you’re right,” said Zemir quietly. Raia recognized that faraway look. One day\
  \ she’d learn the cause of Zemir’s periodic melancholy. </p> \n     <p>Before Zemir\
  \ could say more, the market fell eerily silent. Everyone around them stared upward.\
  \ Zemir and Raia joined them, and watched as the moon eclipsed the sun, and all\
  \ went dark.</p> \n     <p>Soon after, the chittering squeaks and clicks began.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“I recognize those sounds,” said Raia. “Grioths.”</p> \n     <p>“What,\
  \ this far in Near Space?” asked Zemir. </p> \n     <p>“They get closer every year,”\
  \ said Raia sadly. She found grioths a fascinating formation of life. It’s too bad\
  \ so many of them were in the monstrous grip of Nyarlathotep, for their voidglass\
  \ technology and biology was quite interesting and could be put to great use in\
  \ the Pact Worlds.</p> \n     <p>Her thoughts were interrupted by holes opening\
  \ in the moon-eclipsed sky. From these shadowy portals descended a wave of winged\
  \ terrors. The grioths’ silhouettes looked like thousands of bats with arms and\
  \ legs—all of which held glittering weaponry.</p> \n     <p>The technomancer and\
  \ the witchwarper watched the marketgoers flee. In silent agreement, both stood\
  \ still amid the chaos, knowing they could hold off the grioths and allow these\
  \ citizens to get to safety. </p> \n     <p>Several grioth raiders noticed the two\
  \ holding their ground and broke off to attack them. Raia picked off one with a\
  \ single blaster pulse while Zemir stared at another and muttered. Suddenly, the\
  \ grioth’s wing seized and it plummeted to the ground. That left three more, who\
  \ charged in a whirl of chittering squeaks and gleaming, deadly glass. </p> \n \
  \    <p>A fourth landed in front of Raia and swiped at her with its giant, clawed\
  \ hand.</p> \n     <p>“No,” said Raia calmly, stepping back and raising her hands.\
  \ She felt composed, as though in a simulation. She had spent the better part of\
  \ the afternoon familiarizing herself with the tech around her, and now she simply\
  \ had to put it to work, albeit for a new purpose.</p> \n     <p>As the grioth tried\
  \ to grasp her again, she cast a spell with a word and a gesture. Behind her, the\
  \ vast engine powering the veranda block rumbled and cracked. Suddenly, as though\
  \ it were a puppet pulled by the technomancer’s strings, it unleashed from its casing\
  \ and wrapped the grioth in an unbreakable embrace of steel and coiled wire.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Zemir watched his friend fight and wondered how best to aid her in the\
  \ dance. He was no slouch with a blade, but with so many opponents, more help was\
  \ needed. </p> \n     <p>What if, perhaps, another portal opened? One to a world\
  \ filled with bright sunlight? Zemir pondered the possibilities and adjusted probabilities\
  \ as though inputting calculations into the ultimately unknowable machine that was\
  \ the universe. Calculations that, due to his training at the institute, he sometimes\
  \ knew the outcomes for.</p> \n     <p>A bright portal to a sun-filled world opened,\
  \ a world with—yes, perfect—a swarm of apari constituents, who poured from the portal,\
  \ angry and hungry. The grioths shrieked at the light, some clutching their faces\
  \ as its very photons pierced their psychic defenses. At Zemir’s direction, the\
  \ apari swarm crashed against the grioths like a wave, instinctively trying to strike\
  \ back against invaders who would darken a world. </p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ><em></em>Starfinder Galactic Magic</a></h3>\n     </div> \n     <br> \n     <p>“\
  You will all perish for the glory of our dark master,” whispered one of grioth invaders\
  \ with a harsh rasp. Before he could say more, he was overwhelmed by the swarm of\
  \ apari.</p> \n     <p>He could have run—but he wouldn’t. Helping Raia made it worth\
  \ it; knowing that, in some small way, Zemir had adjusted his account, paying back\
  \ what he’d done wrong. He might never be able to atone for leaving his friends\
  \ in that other reality, might never be able to get them back (though another part\
  \ of him still wondered about this) but here, now, at least he and his friend Raia\
  \ could save each other. </p> \n     <p>Together, weaving reality and technology\
  \ with threads of magic, the technomancer and witchwarper beat back the remaining\
  \ two grioth attackers, their martial prowess no match for the pair’s magical mastery.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>“We have to get to the ship,” said Zemir once they had a moment\
  \ to catch their breath. “I can open a gateway there, but I’ve expended a lot of\
  \ power and can only take myself.”</p> \n     <p>“Go. I know you won’t leave me\
  \ behind,” said Raia. For some reason, Zemir looked inexplicably sad at that.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“I will come back for you,” Zemir promised gravely. He stepped through\
  \ the portal and was gone. </p> \n     <p>Raia waited, holding glowing sigils and\
  \ technical weapons in the dark marketplace. From the chittering and squeaks, she\
  \ knew another squad of grioths was inbound. With all the tech around her, Raia\
  \ knew she could hold them off, but not indefinitely. She just hoped that Zemir\
  \ would get back with the ship in time. </p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p style=\"\
