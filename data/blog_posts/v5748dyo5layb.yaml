  \ tempting to leave the blog post at that, but I've got to stop <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5laxd\"\
  >with these</a> <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lawm\">one-line blog posts</a>. They're\
  \ too addictive!</p> \n    <p>Suffice to say, then, that <i>City of Strangers</i>,\
  \ the new Pathfinder Chronicles guide to Varisia's outlaw city of Kaer Maga, has\
  \ shipped to the printer. What you may not know is that this book has been in the\
  \ works, in one form or another, for more than two years at this point. What started\
  \ out as a few-page setting for <a href=\"/pathfinderModules/v5748btpy7zke\"><i>Seven\
  \ Swords of Sin</i></a> grew into one of the first Pathfinder's Journals in <a href=\"\
  /pathfinder/adventurePath/riseOfTheRunelords/v5748btpy80e4\"><i>Pathfinder Adventure\
  \ Path</i> #3: \"The Hook Mountain Massacre.\"</a> From there, with it clear to\
  \ everyone around that I was in love with this city beyond any affection I'd felt\
  \ for a game setting before (though a few have since come to rival it—*cough*solarsystem*cough*),\
  \ it was decided that there should be a book... and not just any book. A setting\
  \ that was at once a bizarre city filled with subterfuge and strange sights, but\
  \ also containing a monumental dungeon that people could venture into again and\
  \ again, with different tropes and themes to the various layers. Not a small order\
  \ (especially considering Erik, James, and Jason had just finished writing the new\
  \ Castle Greyhawk book, whose map turnovers were a million times cooler than anything\
  \ I'd ever drawn). If it was going to be done, Erik decided, it had to be done right,\
  \ and that meant it needed to take as long as it took. Rather than announce the\
  \ project and a projected release date, we wouldn't so much as acknowledge the book\
  \ publicly until it had been completely written.</p> \n    <p>And so, with nothing\
  \ on the schedule, I officially unofficially began work on <i>City of Strangers</i>.\
  \ Six months and a learning curve or two later, I turned over the completed manuscript,\
  \ and the book was officially put on the schedule. If I may say so myself, I'm pretty\
  \ happy with how it turned out. All the gangs are there—the Sweettalkers, who sew\
  \ their own lips shut, and the troll augurs, who read the future in their own entrails.\
  \ The wormfolk and the Tallow Boys, the golem-crafting Ardocs and the mysterious\
  \ Temple of the Child Goddess. All the districts are there, from the egalitarian\
  \ Bottoms where freed slaves fight a shadow war of abolition, to the necromantic\
  \ markets of Ankar-Te where zombies trail after their masters like faithful dogs.\
  \ The Undercity is there, with levels like the Godsmouth Ossuary, the Dark Forest,\
  \ the Forever Bore, the Still Place, and of course Xavorax, City of Silence, the\
  \ city-beneath-the-city that houses the mysterious Caulborn. And despite all the\
  \ words in this book, I'm perhaps most pleased with the maps—it's downright intimidating\
  \ trying to design a city map of a Jacobsian or Schneiderian level of detail (especially\
  \ when they're sitting 20 feet from you), yet Jared Blando did an unbelievable job\
  \ of bringing both the city and the dungeons beneath it to life in a way that both\
  \ mirrored and exceeded my imagination.</p> \n    <p>And now it's away to the printer,\
  \ set to hit stores and subscribers this summer. I hope you enjoy visiting it as\
  \ much as I have. It's been a long, strange journey...</p> \n    <br clear=\"all\"\
