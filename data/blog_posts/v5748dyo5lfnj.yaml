  \       <br>Illustration by Wayne Reynolds\n      </div> \n      <p>The final decade\
  \ of the Age of Enthronement brought hope and innovation to the people of the Inner\
  \ Sea region. In the north, Chelish explorers from Korvosa founded the city of Magnimar.\
  \ In the east, Taldor and Qadira reached an uneasy peace after centuries of antagonism\
  \ and open warfare. In the treacherous Mana Wastes of the south, refugees fleeing\
  \ persecution in Nex settled the Duchy of Alkenstar as a beacon of light and progress\
  \ in a sea of magic-warped madness. And not far away, in Nex's capital city of Quantium,\
  \ the Arclords adopted an orphaned gnome child named Balazar into their most prestigious\
  \ school of magical instruction.</p> \n      <p>Diligent students of the scribbles\
  \ and writings of the long-lost archmage who founded that nation, the Arclords deciphered\
  \ codes and texts from the margins of newly discovered spellbooks and concluded\
  \ that \"children of the First World\" would play an important role in the magical\
  \ administration of the departed wizard's kingdom. In the years before the death\
  \ of Aroden, prophecy was a much more valuable currency in the lands of the Inner\
  \ Sea, and in 4601 the tradition-obsessed Arclords scoured the gnome communities\
  \ infesting their beloved cities for young gnomes to press into service. To prevent\
  \ their great works from falling victim to what they considered a chaotic and untrustworthy\
  \ race of childlike anarchists, the wizards culled only the youngest (and thus in\
  \ their minds least corrupt) gnome children from their parents, imprisoning or destroying\
  \ families with the temerity to go against the marginalia of the wizard who had\
  \ founded the nation and declared the city open to creatures of all races so long\
  \ ago. To the Arclords, any gnome resistance was a revolt against the ideals of\
  \ the nation itself, akin to treason.</p> \n      <p>By 4606, the human god Aroden\
  \ was dead, the power of prophecy was broken, and the Arclords' eugenics experiment\
  \ was veering toward abject failure. As the gnome orphan brood developed into maturity\
  \ in the decades that followed, they brought chaos and catastrophe to Quantium's\
  \ magical academies. And at the center of that chaos stood Balazar: an impulsive\
  \ youth with a temper to equal the bright red ferocity of his prodigious mustache,\
  \ a burning match on a bed of tinder.</p> \n      <p>In the early years of his instruction,\
  \ Balazar revealed almost no magical acumen whatsoever, preferring to spend his\
  \ days conducting merry pranks on his fellow students and instructors instead of\
  \ absorbing himself in the meticulous study of the Arclords' curriculum. When one\
  \ such prank resulted in the transmutation of an instructor's tower into a living\
  \ being of elemental stone (thanks in part to a mysterious glowing rock pilfered\
  \ from the school's vaults), Balazar and three gnome associates found themselves\
  \ expelled from the academy, exiled from Quantium, and sent on the first wagon train\
  \ to Ecanus, the sprawling southern city whose world-famous fleshforges churned\
  \ out a legion of horrors to bolster Nex's armies and terrorize its squalid countryside.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>The Ecanus assignment was intended exclusively as punishment, but the\
  \ city's masters welcomed the gnomes with open arms, eager that their unconventional\
  \ attitudes, boundless creativity, and unpredictable obsessions might aid them in\
  \ conquering one of the most enduring mysteries of the monumental fleshforges. For\
  \ deep within the dungeons below the military complex, in a room designed by the\
  \ Archmage Nex himself, lay an extraplanar rift known as the Void Chasm, a shaft\
  \ of sheer sides and cloying, multicolored mists that had driven insane all who\
  \ had previously gazed within it. </p> \n      <p>One by one, Balazar's gnome associates\
  \ gazed within the abyss, and one by one they lost their tenuous grip on reality.\
  \ Balazar watched in horror as the color drained from their hair and skin, as if\
  \ the whole of their life from birth to bleaching transpired within the span of\
  \ a few moments. When the emotional strain grew too great and the gnomes cried out\
  \ in anguish, the pitiless fleshforge instructors pushed them into the trench, where\
  \ their howls soon faded beneath the swirling mists. If the gnomes could not discover\
  \ the purpose of the Void Chasm, the administrators reasoned, perhaps a sacrifice\
  \ to the unknown powers below would do the trick. </p> \n      <p>As he stood on\
  \ the precipice of the Void, Balazar wondered if perhaps he should have studied\
  \ more diligently in the relative comfort of Quantium's academies. Reluctantly,\
  \ he cast his gaze into the miasma and felt the weird energies of the Chasm worming\
  \ their way into his mind. Worse, he heard whispering voices in the mists, calling\
  \ out to him and begging him to step over the edge. At first he thought the voices\
  \ to be those of his lost fellow gnomes, and called back to them one by one even\
  \ as the color drained from his hair and he felt his mind slipping away. But the\
  \ voices were not those of his friends. They belonged to… something else. </p> \n\
  \      <p>It took all of Balazar's limited concentration to sift the many voices\
  \ from each other. Some were angry, demanding to be left alone. Others beckoned\
  \ with honeyed words of sweet oblivion. But one voice among the tumult spoke softly\
  \ and plainly. \"I will help you,\" it said in reassuring tones. \"Give me form\
  \ and allow me to leave this prison, and you and I will become as one.\"</p> \n\
  \      <p>With the hands of the fleshforge administrators on his shoulders, about\
  \ to give the final push that would send him into nothingness, Balazar tried to\
  \ imagine what the voice would look like. He dreamed of a creature with a vast serpentine\
  \ body, with grasping talons and horrifying scales. And, perhaps because he had\
  \ not eaten that day and was growing hungry, he imagined the voice speaking through\
  \ the beak of a monstrous chicken. And then, just as he felt the muscles of his\
  \ captors tense for the final push, the creature he had imagined emerged from the\
  \ Void Chasm fully formed and fully real, screaming a hideous avian cry and weaving\
  \ through the air with serpentine grace. Its claws tore at the necks of the administrators,\
  \ its hideous beak making a mess of their unbelieving eyes. And all along, in reassuring\
  \ tones only he could hear, it spoke to him. \"Do not be afraid, little one,\" it\
  \ said. \"We were meant to be together.\"</p> \n      <p>Somehow, Balazar and the\
  \ avian entity that called itself Padrig managed to win their way free of the fleshforges,\
  \ of Ecanus, and even of Nex. As he fled up the eastern coast of Garund on a succession\
  \ of merchant and smuggler vessels, Balazar and Padrig grew closer and closer to\
  \ one another. Padrig explained that he was a bodiless being known as an eidolon,\
  \ and that only Balazar could give him structure and form due to the affinity of\
  \ their minds and souls. As the gnome made his way from Nex to Katapesh to Absalom,\
  \ Balazar grew more and more adept at shifting Padrig's form to add more legs, terrible\
  \ wings, or other features fitting the dangers and situations at hand. When things\
  \ got too dangerous to be seen with a magical creature or when discretion was more\
  \ important than protection, Balazar dismissed Padrig to some extraplanar hidey-hole,\
  \ only to call him once again to his side when needed. </p> \n      <p>Although\
  \ a great deal of the young Balazar's mischievous spirit remains, the horror of\
  \ the Void Chasm remains with him to this day. Other gnomes often confuse his stark\
  \ white hair for a symptom of the insidious bleaching that threatens all gnomekind,\
  \ but through his constant and relentless travels Balazar remains as engaged and\
  \ full of life as any of his healthy gnome brethren. When other gnomes inquire about\
  \ his \"condition\" with the best of intentions, Balazar sometimes flies into an\
  \ impatient fit of grumpiness, chastising his would-be helpers and instructing them\
  \ to mind their own business.</p> \n      <p>Privacy is very, very important to\
  \ Balazar, for the Nexian wizards he betrayed have not forgotten his singular mastery\
  \ of the Void Chasm. Agents of the Arclords of Nex dog his travels at every stop,\
  \ pushing him further and further away with each season. Balazar knows that each\
  \ new stop—however temporary—will provide him with ample opportunity to learn new\
  \ things and meet new people, to master the magical craft that always eluded him\
  \ in Nex, and to do honor to the friends and colleagues he left behind. Despite\
  \ occasional moments of maudlin reflection on all he has lost, Balazar takes comfort\
  \ in his enduring friendship with the eidolon he recued from oblivion so long ago.\
  \ As long as he travels with Padrig, he knows he will never be alone.</p> \n   \
