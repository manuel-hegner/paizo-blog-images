  \     </div>\n     <blockquote>\n      <h2>The Sound of Love — Moderate 11</h2>\n\
  \      <p itemprop=\"description\">This encounter takes place at a shrine for the\
  \ Black Butterfly. Your PCs could have heard rumors of the shrine or have been invited\
  \ to a <em>heartbond</em>ritual taking place at the sanctuary. The shrine is a series\
  \ of smaller altars and sanctuaries that were built to be traveled between in utter\
  \ silence with respect to the Black Butterfly, allowing travelers to meditate on\
  \ the silence between.</p>\n      <p>The PCs are given an opportunity to reflect\
  \ on their previous adventures and meditate on their future choices. If they choose\
  \ to travel in silence, they become more aware of the beautiful vista before them.\
  \ They notice how green the trees are and how beautiful the nearby river sounds\
  \ as it tumbles on its way, unconcerned with the happenings of the world around\
  \ it. The air begins to smell fresher and cool against their skin. PCs who remain\
  \ silent during their travels gain a +1 status bonus to Perception checks while\
  \ traveling between the altars.</p>\n      <p>When the PCs arrive at the final altar,\
  \ they are welcomed by a small gathering of nobles who decided this shrine was the\
  \ perfect location for their <em>heartbond</em> ritual. When the ceremony begins,\
  \ trumpets are sounded to announce the union to the world. Unbeknownst to the nobles,\
  \ a quai dau to stealthily hunts nearby, and the sound of trumpets sends it on a\
  \ rampage. It inflates and flies towards the ceremony with rage in its eyes.</p>\n\
  \      <p><strong>Map:</strong> This map uses a portion of the <em>Pathfinder Flip-Mat:\
  \ Night Market &amp; Shrine</em></p>\n      <p><strong>Creatures:</strong> The local\
  \ quai dau to normally hunts the river in peace, leaving the silent visitors of\
  \ the shrine alone. However, they are very sensitive to loud noises and the trumpets,\
  \ which caused the beast great distress. The quai dau to will attack the creature\
  \ making the most noise. PCs can spend an action to calm the beast (DC 32 Nature\
  \ check), provided they can get everyone else to become completely quiet. This DC\
  \ is reduced by 5 if the quai dau to is reduced to 150 HP or lower. The beast will\
  \ flee if reduced to 50 HP or lower.</p>\n      <center>\n       <hr width=\"75%\"\
