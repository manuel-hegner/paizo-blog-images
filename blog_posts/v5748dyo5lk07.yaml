  \   <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\"><a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9uf8?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Elemental-Masters-Handbook\"><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Player Companion: Elemental Master's Handbook</em></a> is just about to coalesce\
  \ from the elements to land in your hands, so it's time to let you know what it's\
  \ about! This book is a player-focused look at wielding elemental powers. Whether\
  \ your PC studied elemental forces as a route to power, was born with an inherent\
  \ connection to these primordial forces, or became cursed with an affiliation to\
  \ one entity at the expense of vulnerability to another, this book is for you. Whether\
  \ or not your GM plans to provide you with planar adventures, such by using the\
  \ recent <a href=\"/products/btpy9ng0?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Planes-of-Power\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Planes of Power</em></a>, you'll find this book\
  \ to be invaluable!</p> \n    <p><em>Elemental Master's Handbook</em> is broken\
  \ up into several sections. First up are four long sections about air, earth, fire,\
  \ and water. Each of these sections provides one or two new archetypes, such as\
  \ the firebrand gunslinger archetype, who uses dragon pistols effectively but recklessly,\
  \ or the storm caller summoner archetype, who can hurl lightning. These sections\
  \ also present a variety of additional rules elements like new magic items, rogue\
  \ talents, and bloodlines. All these rules are infused with elemental flavor: for\
  \ example, desperation is a new spiritualist phantom focus to reflect a death by\
  \ drowning or suffocation. Tragic? Yes. But also cool. Each elemental section concludes\
  \ with a look at a few places on Golarion where your PC may have been steeped in\
  \ elemental power, including a new feat for each. For example, the following new\
  \ feat fits characters with a connection to the dwarven Sky Citadel of Kraggodan.</p>\
  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <h3>Kraggodan's Stance (Combat)</h3> \n     <p class=\"\
  stat-block\">You have learned one of the secrets of Kraggodan's defenders and can\
  \ lock your armor and shield into an impenetrable barrier.</p> \n     <p class=\"\
  stat-block-1\"><b>Prerequisites</b>: Con 13, proficiency with heavy armor and shields.<br>\
  \ <b>Benefit</b>: As a move action when wearing heavy armor and using a heavy shield\
  \ or tower shield, you increase the bonus to AC granted by your armor and your shield\
  \ by 1 each until you move or are moved from your current square. You must be in\
  \ contact with solid ground to gain this benefit. You can never increase an armor\
  \ or shield bonus to AC by more than 1 each in this way.</p> \n    </blockquote>\

  ></a> \n     <p>\"Good? Bad? I'm the kid with the stick.\"<br> <i>Illustration by\
  \ Graey Erb</i></p>\n    </div> \n    <p>The rest of <em>Elemental Master's Handbook</em>\
  \ contains several shorter sections, each touching on a different facet of elemental\
  \ mastery. There has been some public speculation about whether this book will have\
  \ kineticist content—of course it does! In addition to rules items scattered throughout\
  \ the book that kineticists will find invaluable, there's an entire section devoted\
  \ to kineticists alone. This section includes new infusions, utility wild talents,\
  \ and feats—like this one.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <h3>Mobile Gathering</h3>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"stat-block\">You can gather elemental energy while walking slowly.</p>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Prerequisites</b>: Kineticist level 7th, kinetic\
  \ blast class feature.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Benefit</b>: While\
  \ taking a move action to gather power, you can move up to half your base speed,\
  \ and while taking 1 full round to gather power, you can move up to half your speed\
  \ on the turn you begin the full round of gathering power. This movement provokes\
  \ attacks of opportunity, and you can't use Acrobatics checks or other abilities\
  \ to attempt to negate them, as you're concentrating on gathering power (nor can\
  \ you use Acrobatics to balance, jump, or do anything else that requires a skill\
  \ check). It's harder to concentrate on gathering power while using this feat; if\
  \ you take damage during or after gathering power and before using a kinetic blast\
  \ that releases it (including from an attack of opportunity provoked by the movement),\
  \ the concentration check DC to avoid losing the gathered power increases by twice\
  \ the blast's effective spell level.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>An advantage—\
  or a curse, I suppose, depending on how you look at it—of being in one of my home\
  \ games is that I'll sometimes introduce new rules items I'm writing or developing.\
  \ The kineticist player in my <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/hellsVengeance\"\
  >Hell's Vengeance</a> game already uses some of these rules items to blast paladins\
  \ and angels with wanton abandon.</p> \n    <p>Another section of <em>Elemental\
  \ Master's Handbook</em> presents elemental augmentations, which permanently alter\
  \ a portion the recipient's body by infusing it with primordial powers. An augmented\
  \ body part is forever altered; the elemental augmentation remains until the body\
  \ part is removed, which can have some unfortunate side effects. Elemental augmentations\
  \ come with some powerful advantages, but also carry some corresponding weaknesses\
  \ that tend to be more flavorful than debilitating. What? You don't follow? Is this\
  \ some trick to get an example out of me? Okay, done.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb180\"\

  \ \n     <p class=\"stat-block-title\">Quicksilver Blood <span class=\"stat-block-cr\"\

  \ with liquid metal that is magically bound to the recipient's system. When the\
  \ recipient bleeds, the metal clings to itself and turns a bright silver color.\
  \ The recipient automatically stabilizes when at negative hit points and is immune\
  \ to continuous damage from bleed attacks (including weapons with the <i>wounding</i>\
  \ special ability) and ability damage from blood drain. The recipient is considered\
  \ a ferrous creature for the purposes of spells and effects such as <i>rusting grasp</i>\
  \ and a rust monster's attack.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block\">This elemental\
  \ augmentation cannot be applied to a creature without blood.</p> \n     <p class=\"\

  \ blood</i><sup>ACG</sup>, <i>lesser restoration</i>, creator must have 9 ranks\
  \ in Knowledge (planes)</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>There's more neat stuff\
  \ here than I can get into, such as a new oracle mystery that blends elemental powers\
  \ together, the aether elemental school for wizards, and the new genie eidolon subtype\
  \ that can improve its own powers only in response to its summoner uttering a wish.\
  \ Elemental powers for any PC can be yours!</p> \n    <p>As a final note, the first\
  \ bardic masterpiece has a missing title. Although I briefly considered inviting\
  \ readers to propose their favorite name for this masterpiece, I'll just tell you:\
  \ it's Blazing Rondo (oratory, percussion).</p> \n    <p>Ron Lundeen<br> <i>Contributing\
