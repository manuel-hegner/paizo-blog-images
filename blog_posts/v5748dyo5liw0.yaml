  \ itemprop=\"articlebody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Let's talk about death,\
  \ baby. It's become a hot-button subject since the launch of <a href=\"https://pathfinder.obsidian.net\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Pathfinder Adventures</a>, where a legion of fans were presented\
  \ with the choice of using a \"permadeath\" option or letting the fear of death\
  \ fall by the wayside. There are lots of good reasons why death works the way it\
  \ does in the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game, so three of us are providing you with\
  \ three very different perspectives on the subject. Mike will talk about death in\
  \ the home version of the physical card game, Nathan will talk about death in the\
  \ digital game, and Tanis will talk about death in organized play.</p> \n    <h2>Mike's\
  \ Take: \"Permadeath, All the Time\"</h2> \n    <p>The Pathfinder Adventure Card\
  \ Game is built on the principle that if you try to draw a card that isn't there,\
  \ you've kicked the bucket, shuffled off your mortal coil, run down the curtain,\
  \ and joined the bleedin' choir invisible. You are an ex-character.</p> \n    <p>The\
  \ rationale for this is simple: If the danger of death isn't there, the game breaks\
  \ down. If you know you can't die, you don't fear the consequences of your actions.\
  \ So you might embrace what us game designers call \"degenerate behavior.\" For\
  \ example, if you know you can't die, you might forgo that offer from Kyra to heal\
  \ you, and get an extra exploration. That one exploration can matter a lot.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>For example, you may know that I went in for knee surgery a little while\
  \ back. So I resolved to play through all of the Obsidian game that was available,\
  \ through <em>Hook Mountain Massacre</em>. And get this: My party failed to defeat\
  \ Xanesha on the final card of the blessings deck <i>two games in a row</i>. If\
  \ I wasn't worried about them dying, there's no way I'd get in that predicament.\
  \ That's how the game is balanced.</p> \n    <p>The presumption built into the game\
  \ is that you're playing a campaign, and losing a character is a massive deal. I\
  \ lost two characters in the run-up to that Angel in the Tower double-failure. Sajan\
  \ died during Attack on Sandpoint and Lini kicked it during Local Heroes. (Let me\
  \ underscore that for emphasis: <u><i>She died in Local Heroes</i></u>.) So the\
  \ new guys, Harsk and Kyra, didn't actually ever finish <em>Burnt Offerings</em>,\
  \ and so they missed out on the adventure's feats. They turned out a little less\
  \ buff because their predecessors offed it. Now, I could go back and do those early\
  \ scenarios with Harsk and Kyra, but I'm running a story here. Also, this is a moot\
  \ point, since Harsk and Kyra died too, in the last scenario of <em>Hook Mountain\
  \ Massacre</em>. I knew we named it that for a reason. We won't be seeing those\
  \ four again, any more than John Cleese will ever have a functional parrot.</p>\
  \ \n    <h2>Nathan's Take: \"Digital Dice Are Unforgiving Enough\"</h2> \n    <p>Let\
  \ me first state for the record: When my group plays the Adventure Card Game, death\
  \ is real and not forgiven. Just ask our Ekkie player who died in WotR 1.4 and had\
  \ to play her cousin Rekkie solo through the first 9 scenarios to catch up.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>But when it came to Pathfinder Adventures, we decided to make death less\
  \ than permanent by default. Is it because we are nice? Ummm... Nope! We did invent\
  \ the Darkest Night Wildcard which costs you a card from the blessings deck each\
  \ time you fail to acquire a boon (which should give you some indication of our\
  \ generosity). Actually, it's quite the contrary, and doesn't have much to do with\
  \ game difficulty at all.</p> \n    <p>It's all about how we save games! I wanted\
  \ to preserve the sanctity of rolled dice and cards found in the location deck.\
  \ As the guy who has reloaded the heck out of <em>X-COM, Civilization</em>, and\
  \ <em>Total War</em> to get the rolls I wanted, I understand the temptation to cheese\
  \ the system's random number generator. I even would go as far as to crash <em>Elder\
  \ Sign: Omens</em> on purpose to reroll. Is that fun? There's a not very good argument\
  \ that it is, but I knew that to preserve the importance of risk and choice in Pathfinder\
  \ Adventures, we had to remove the concept of \"Saved Games\" that you load.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Instead, you play with a party or parties. Every time you confirm an\
  \ action by rolling, drawing a card, or tapping the confirmation arrow, you've made\
  \ a permanent decision that can't be reversed by any means.</p> \n    <p>Okay, fine.\
  \ What does this have to do with death? Put simply, if you make a mistake at the\
  \ game table, it's adjudicated by people who can determine how honest the mistake\
  \ was. If you make a mistake in the digital game, like you swiped to roll when you\
  \ weren't ready or you didn't realize it was Lem's turn and not Valeros' when you\
  \ decide to take on the villain, there's no take-backs. And if you're just learning\
  \ the game for the first time and you didn't quite understand the deck-to-life equation,\
  \ you might put down the game for good.</p> \n    <p>Bottom line: If you are a new\
  \ casual player, enjoy non-permadeath while learning the game! The rest of you don't\
  \ really have an excuse to play anything but permadeath!</p> \n    <h2>Tanis's Take:\
  \ \"I Like to Make You Suffer, But I Don't Like to Make You Quit\"</h2> \n    <p>In\
  \ Adventure Card Guild games, the bulk of reported play that we're seeing is weekly\
  \ or fortnightly games at local game stores and game days. I'm aiming to provide\
  \ a fun experience that people will make part of their routine. And as Mike and\
  \ Nathan have already said, it's hard to generate an exhilarating victory without\
  \ the real possibility of death or loss.</p> \n    <p>In Season of the Shackles,\
  \ I decided to run with the base game's rules on advancement and death. People enjoyed\
  \ themselves, but missing a week at the store because your kid was sick or because\
  \ you had a conflicting event would automatically put you behind the rest of your\
  \ party. And if you died late in the season? You were never going to catch up to\
  \ your friends again. Social contract voided, six months of fun washed away, and\
  \ a bad taste left in your mouth. Not ideal.</p> \n    <p>I've been at a table where\
  \ someone's playing Adventure 5 and a character dies, and it suuuuuucks. In the\
  \ Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild, usually someone at a high-level table will\
  \ have a way to access resurrection magic or some kind, whether via a cleric or\
  \ druid at the table or via special access to some sort of life-restoring magic\
  \ earned during play. In the Adventure Card Guild, you wouldn't want to depend on\
  \ a cleric having a Raise Dead in her deck. So I added a metagame system that allows\
  \ players to expend pretty valuable resources—die bumps—to resurrect a fallen comrade.\
  \ Die bumps are earned when characters complete an adventure, and they can be used\
  \ to modify a roll after it's been made. The party can collectively expend 3 die\
  \ bumps to resurrect a character at the end of a scenario. There's still pain, and\
  \ dying still sucks, but I'm glad we found a way to allow people to keep playing.\
  \ Like Dory, we want you to just keep playing. (This is where Disney•Pixar pays\
  \ me the big bucks for nudging you to go see <i>Finding Dory</i>.)</p> \n    <p>If\
  \ you don't like those rules, you can always go by <a href=\"/threads/rzs2rdxy\"\
  >Selinker's Law</a>: \"It's organized play, son. When your character dies, you die\
  \ too.\"</p> \n    <p>Mike Selinker and Tanis O'Connor<br> <i>Adventure Card Game\
