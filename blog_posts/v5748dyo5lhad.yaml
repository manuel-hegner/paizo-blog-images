  \     <p>When I first picked up <em>Pathfinder Adventure Card Gameâ€”Rise of the Runelords</em>\
  \ I was extremely unsure that the kids would like it. We played 3 straight games\
  \ and failed the first time on the Poison Pill scenario, then immediately replayed\
  \ it and won quite easily. They are looking forward to the last scenario and then\
  \ moving onto the next adventure shortly after.</p> \n     <p>Obviously these are\
  \ our more experienced kids, though they are still young (aged 13, 13, and 15, respectively),\
  \ but they grasped the issue of developing their decks to improve their chances\
  \ in the game, making their character more versatile and mitigating character weaknesses.\
  \ Also, it was good to see the way each character had a role to play in the game\
  \ and prompted them to work as a team.</p> \n     <p>We started the <em>Reign of\
  \ Winter</em> Adventure Path last Thursday with a slightly new group of kids, some\
  \ of whom are straight out of the village in Northern Uganda. Putting them into\
  \ a snow scenario was quite interesting and the session was quite enjoyable.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>I am continuing <a href=\"/threads/rzs2r32h\">my blog on the forums</a>\
  \ and more people are following it these days. Also, we have had a generous number\
  \ of Pathfinder Modules and other hardback materials donated by one of Paizo's writers,\
  \ which we are shipping by container in May to Uganda.</p> \n     <p>Very best wishes,</p>\
