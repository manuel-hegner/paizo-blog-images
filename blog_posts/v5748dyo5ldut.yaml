  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">Now\
  \ that Gen Con is over, and I only have to finish plans for Pax Prime and get ready\
  \ for my trip to Dragon*Con in Atlanta next week, I am finally able to get back\
  \ on track with our series of international Pathfinder Society blogs. This time,\
  \ we go to some of the most remote Pathfinder Society play in the world down in\
  \ Australia. I have a great fondness in my heart for Australians. I was able to\
  \ have a drink with several of the Australian Venture-Captains and Lieutenants when\
  \ they came up for PaizoCon in July. Wes Nicholson always brings me Tim Tams when\
  \ he and I are at the same convention, and at Gen Con last week, he brought me beer.\
  \ And, I have met Matt Goodall (RPG Superstar) at both PaizoCon and Gen Con, and\
  \ was able to share some war stories with him. So, I reached out to all three Venture-Captains\
  \ in Australia and below is what they had to say about Pathfinder Society scene\
  \ in there.</span></p> \n    <p>Before we get to those three reports, I wanted to\
  \ announce that a fourth Venture-Captain has been added to Australia. Daniel Flood\
  \ will be overseeing coordination of Pathfinder Society in Brisbane. Welcome aboard\
  \ Daniel! I look forward to watching you facilitate growth of Pathfinder Society\
  \ from the amazing level it currently is, to the awesome level I know it can reach.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>First, we start on the west coast in Perth with Callum Prior.</p> \n\
  \    <blockquote> \n     <p>My name is Callum (buzzby on the boards), I'm currently\
  \ Venture-Captain for Western Australia. I'm a Community Development Officer for\
  \ one of the largest local governments in the state. I previously spent about a\
  \ decade as a self-employed music and tour manager and prior to that I worked as\
  \ a butler to the Governor (Her Majesty's representative, not the American-style\
  \ governor. Rule Britannia!).</p> \n     <p>Western Australia alone takes up a third\
  \ of the country, coming in at 20 times larger than England and more than 3-1/2\
  \ times bigger than Texas, but our whole state only has a population of 1.7 million.\
  \ We're spread pretty thin in terms of population centers. Our side of the country,\
  \ in particular, suffers from what we like to call the \"tyranny of distance.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>The next closest Venture-Captain is a leisurely 3,438 km away in\
  \ Melbourne. We have one gaming store in the metropolitan area and we don't have\
  \ access to a dedicated RPG convention.</p> \n     <p>Back in the heady days of\
  \ late 2011 I started email contact with Melbourne Venture-Captain Stephen White,\
  \ who at the time had jurisdiction over the whole of Australia. With my home gaming\
  \ group only able to meet up two or three times a year due to the perils of real\
  \ life, I was keen to see if Pathfinder Society might be a reasonable alternative.\
  \ Sadly we weren't able to locate any locally reported events and I went back to\
  \ playing knifey-spoony and looking for ways to support Stephen over here.</p> \n\
  \     <p>However, several weeks later, Stephen sent me an email pointing to Mike's\
  \ call out for volunteers in new regions. I submitted my application and here I\
  \ am.</p> \n     <p>We don't have a strong history of organied play over here and\
  \ with just the one gaming store, a lot of my work is building partnerships with\
  \ other (not always gaming) groups and seeking opportunities outside of the normal\
  \ gaming hot spots.</p> \n     <p>A great recent example of this is RFLAN, a local\
  \ LAN event that runs four times a year and routinely sells out to a capacity 450\
  \ gamers. I've been working with them to have a presence at their events, the first\
  \ of which we ran last month starting off with a modest single table. They've kindly\
  \ offered us even more at the next event, enough for five tables, and it's something\
  \ I hope to build into a quarterly Pathfinder convention.</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderSociety/20120827-Photo3_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>We've also been able to attend a number of local\
  \ pop culture conventions—WAICON (anime), Swancon (science fiction), and GenghisCon\
  \ (speculative fiction and gaming)—all for the first time. Feedback from all of\
  \ these have been very positive, and I'm quite excited at what we'll be able to\
  \ bring to those events next year.</p> \n     <p>Most recently I was able to appoint\
  \ Chris Chisolm as my Venture-Lieutenant. Chris will be caretaking our metro events\
  \ while I make a start establishing groups in some of our regional areas.</p> \n\
  \     <p>So, starting from nothing scant months ago we now have 88 players registered\
  \ on Warhorn, hit 100 subscribers to our email newsletter, run weekly events at\
  \ a number of different venues, have attended all the major pop culture conventions\
  \ bar one (we'll get you next year, Supanova!) and are starting to see our first\
  \ starred GMs.</p> \n     <p>Callum Prior<br> <i>Venture-Captain, Western Australia</i></p>\
  \ \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Now we move 3,438km (or 2,136 miles) to the east\
  \ for Pathfinder Society in Melbourne.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <div style=\"\
  float: left; padding: 0 1em .5em 0;\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderSociety/20120827-KoalaGoblin.jpg\"\

  0\"></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>I'm Stephen White, previously Venture-Captain, Australia—\
  more recently demoted to Venture-Captain, Melbourne. Though that's all cool, because\
  \ I realized going in that one person can't possibly oversee a region as vast as\
  \ Australia, I'm very grateful for the work Al, Callum, and many others are doing\
  \ in other cities throughout the country.</p> \n     <p>I'm a long-time gaymer,\
  \ having purchased the 1981 Basic Box with birthday money as a teenager, and played\
  \ every edition (minus one) of the game since, including GMing the original Adventure\
  \ Path (Dragonlance) through two editions.</p> \n     <p>When I moved from Adelaide\
  \ to Melbourne, I nervously attended my first gaming convention, and discovered\
  \ a thriving community of players. I enjoyed Living Greyhawk and Living Arcanis\
  \ and an occasional Eberron game (I'm the VC who loves non-core races!) for 5 years,\
  \ meeting some great friends along the way. When those campaigns wound down due\
  \ to edition changes, I was concerned for the future of our local gaming scene.\
  \ Being a long-time collector of Dragon and Dungeon magazines, I followed Paizo's\
  \ transition to Pathfinder with great interest, buying a copy of the Pathfinder\
  \ RPG Beta for each of my homegroup players and GMing Runelords and Crimson Throne.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>A strong perception I had growing up in Adelaide during the '80s was\
  \ that all of the big RPG conventions, events, and promotions seemed to be focused\
  \ on the USA or perhaps Europe. RPG products cost twice the cover price in Australia\
  \ due to international shipping and the weak Aussie dollar. Being an island nation\
  \ isolates us—travel to even our closest neighboring countries requires costly overseas\
  \ flights.</p> \n     <p>Some of the barriers to participating as a single international\
  \ RPG community have reduced in recent years, such as the growth of Internet communications,\
  \ PDF downloads, a stronger Aussie dollar reducing the cost of imported books, and\
  \ more competitive airline industry making flights more affordable. Aussies now\
  \ participate more frequently and equally in many fields internationally, and nothing\
  \ represents this more in our hobby than our very own Matthew Goodall winning RPG\
  \ Superstar 2010, and more recently authoring Pathfinder Adventure Path #57: Tempest\
  \ Rising (Skull &amp; Shackles).</p> \n     <p>It is very much this sense of wanting\
  \ Australians to participate in RPG events on equal terms that, when Paizo released\
  \ Hollow's Last Hope, motivated me to download and run my first public Pathfinder\
  \ gameday in Melbourne—Free RPG Day 2007. That was 5 years ago now, and I've GMed\
  \ Pathfinder modules at Free RPG Day events every year since.</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ other reason I became a Pathfinder GM was in appreciation of all those who ran\
  \ tables of Living Greyhawk, Living Arcanis, or Eberron for me at Melbourne conventions.\
  \ You may not have realised it at the time, but I learned a lot from you all, and\
  \ your efforts inspired me to be where I am writing this blog post today. GMing\
  \ Pathfinder is my way of giving back to the community that supported my enjoyment\
  \ of the game for all those years, and I hope in return I may inspire others to\
  \ do likewise.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb180\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderSociety/20120827-Photo6.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderSociety/20120827-Photo6_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>So it was that I started GMing Pathfinder Society\
  \ scenarios right from Season 0's beginning, starting with my home group, who then\
  \ became my GM team at Melbourne's three annual games conventions, Arcanacon, Conquest,\
  \ and Unicon. With the help of GMs across the country, we descended on Brisbane,\
  \ bringing Pathfinder Society to Gen ConOz and then PaizoConOz for the last 3 years.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Since becoming Venture-Captain, I realized that GMing Pathfinder at\
  \ four conventions per year wasn't enough—we also need to run public gamedays at\
  \ our local game stores. The Geelong guys were a step ahead of me, already hosting\
  \ Pathfinder every Thursday night. I discovered a new Good Games store had recently\
  \ opened at Blackburn, so I thought that would be the perfect place to start my\
  \ own local group. We've been running Pathfinder Society tables at Blackburn every\
  \ Sunday for nearly 2 years now, and we're also starting to host games in the Melbourne\
  \ CBD. Players can sign up to play Pathfinder Society in and around Melbourne on\
  \ our <a href=\"http://warhorn.net/melbourne-pfs\" target=\"_blank\">Warhorn page</a>,\
  \ though Pathfinder Society events are also being scheduled in cities across Australia—\
  check out <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/events\">Paizo's event calendar</a> for upcoming\
  \ gamedays.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb180\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderSociety/20120827-Photo4.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderSociety/20120827-Photo4_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>And can I just say WOW, Sydney?! The Pathfinder\
  \ Society growth experienced in Sydney has been phenomenal, and raises a community\
  \ building challenge for us all to aspire toward, including my own Melbourne region.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Despite our country's size (roughly the size of continental USA), Australia\
  \ has a population of only 22 million, compared to USA's 313 million. Australian\
  \ cities are therefore quite isolated from one another—the \"tyranny of distance.\"\
  \ To put this into perspective, Melbourne and Sydney are a day's drive apart; Melbourne\
  \ to Brisbane is 2-day's drive; and I'm told driving from Melbourne to Perth requires\
  \ 3 full days driving across nothing but featureless desert, which no sane person\
  \ would even attempt.</p> \n     <p>Nonetheless, a few of us do travel to each others\
  \ conventions from time to time, and it's always great to meet players from other\
  \ regions. We're currently aware of Pathfinder Society gamedays in Adelaide, Brisbane,\
  \ Canberra, Geelong, Melbourne, Newcastle, Perth, Rockhampton, Sydney, Tasmania,\
  \ and Woolongong. If you're playing Pathfinder anywhere in Australia, we'd love\
  \ to hear about it and keep in touch.</p> \n     <p>The single message I most want\
  \ to leave you with is that anyone can advertise and host a local Pathfinder Society\
  \ gameday—that's exactly how I and many others started. Everyone benefits from a\
  \ growing community. Sharing and rotating GM duty encourages more play opportunities,\
  \ and meeting local players can open homegame opportunities such as Adventure Paths.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>When I attended my first games convention, it was because I had no one\
  \ local to game with. Now I'm gaming every Saturday and Sunday, every week of the\
  \ year, and have made many good friendships in the process.</p> \n     <p>Make your\
  \ own opportunities happen!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"\

  \ \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Finally, we move a \"day's drive\" from Melbolurne\
  \ to Syndney.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>Currently, Australia has three Venture-Captains:\
  \ Stephen White (aka DarkWhite) in Melbourne; Callum Prior (aka buzzby) in Perth;\
  \ and myself, Alistair Rigg (aka The Spider) in Sydney.</p> \n     <p>I have been\
  \ building up the Pathfinder Society scene here since late 2009 and was appointed\
  \ Venture-Captain in October 2011, shortly after the call for regional Australian\
  \ Venture-Captains. I started playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons in my hometown of Kendal,\
  \ in the northwest of the UK, with the Red Box back in 1982. A fanatic of Steve\
  \ Jackson and Ian Livingstone's Fighting Fantasy gamebooks, I was originally confused\
  \ that, in D&amp;D, I wasn't constrained by a short list of possible actions. It\
  \ wasn't until I attended a local game day, in which I rolled up a 1st-level fighter,\
  \ joined a band of higher-level heroes seeking to assault Castle Ravenloft, and\
  \ was finally struck dead by the horrific keening of a groaning spirit, that I truly\
  \ grasped how to play, and was completely and utterly hooked. </p> \n     <p>I migrated\
  \ to Sydney in 1997 where I continued to play and GM by helping to start several\
  \ gaming groups through my workplace and a local game store. We played through 2nd\
  \ to 4th Edition, but settled on Pathfinder as our system of choice. We became involved\
  \ with Pathfinder Society when we attended Gen Con Oz 2009 in Brisbane. There, we\
  \ drank beer with Jason Bulmahn, and became friends with other Pathfinder players\
  \ and GMs who remain active in the Australian Pathfinder Society to this day. Back\
  \ in Sydney, I immediately started organizing Pathfinder Society game days. I started\
  \ organizing Society conventions when Gen Con Oz 2010 was cancelled. As we had already\
  \ booked our flights and accommodation, we needed an alternative and so Stephen\
  \ White, Richard Adamson, John Deague, and I organized PaizoCon Oz. The event was\
  \ a great success, and having learned a little of what was required, resolved to\
  \ get involved with the convention scene in Sydney.</p> \n     <p>Australia is a\
  \ big country. It's roughly the size of continental USA but with a total population\
  \ of just under 23 million, most of whom are located in cities along the eastern\
  \ seaboard. Australia is therefore characterized by urban populations separated\
  \ by huge spaces of open country and desert. This \"tyranny of distance\" shapes\
  \ our efforts in building the Pathfinder Society in Australia, forcing each Venture-Captain\
  \ to develop in relative isolation from each other. I'm separated from Steve's region\
  \ by around 600 miles, and from Cal's region by around 2,500 miles! It also means\
  \ that, geographically speaking, our areas are quite large. Sydney's urban area\
  \ is in a coastal basin, which is bordered by the Pacific Ocean to the east, the\
  \ Blue Mountains to the west, the Hawkesbury River to the north, and the Royal National\
  \ Park to the south. Sydney's urban area is around 650 square miles and has a population\
  \ of around 4.6 million. This is my core region.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb180\"\

  /image/content/PathfinderSociety/20120827-Photo5_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>My outer region, however, comprises the state of New South\
  \ Wales, which contains the Australian Capital Territory. Apart from Sydney, the\
  \ other major cities in this area are Canberra, Newcastle, and Wollongong. This\
  \ outer region is so vast that it would be impossible for me to personally manage\
  \ events across it on anything but an occasional basis and so self-managing groups\
  \ are vital. Currently, by far the strongest of these is in Australia's capital\
  \ city of Canberra, ably managed by Wes Nicholson, Sean Wellsmore, and Steven Coling\
  \ through a roleplaying society based at the Australian National University. They\
  \ run game days every other week, have a convention calendar that runs throughout\
  \ the year, and are going from strength to strength. A new group has also recently\
  \ started in Wollongong. Jesper Bjelke and Sibel Yilmaz are running a monthly game\
  \ day at Good Games Wollongong and have forged links with the University of Wollongong's\
  \ Guild Gaming Society who have just run their first convention, Gong-Con. Most\
  \ of their players are new to Pathfinder Society, only just finished taking their\
  \ First Steps.</p> \n     <p>In my core region of Sydney, there are 5 game days\
  \ each month. Although the stores that have space for games are happy to host us,\
  \ and for which we're very grateful, we do all of the organizing and running ourselves.\
  \ On the first Saturday, Neil Mansell runs six sessions at Unlimited Hobbies in\
  \ Blacktown along with his GMs, Adam Mansell, Brendan Missio, and James Bonham.\
  \ On the second Saturday, Ben Kemp and Tony Calder runs four sessions through the\
  \ long-running Blacktown Games Day at Blacktown North Public School. On the third\
  \ Saturday, Luke Parry, Brad Kirkwood, and Adam Luchjenbroers run three sessions\
  \ at Good Games Sydney, and Brendan Missio and David Zammit run games at Tin Soldier\
  \ Penrith. On the last Saturday of the month, Tris Sullivan and Seb Mullins run\
  \ two sessions at Good Games Burwood. More game days are in the works as well, and\
  \ we hope to have sessions up and running in Miranda and Newcastle soon.</p> \n\
  \     <p>Sydney's convention scene is also well developed with six conventions per\
  \ year. The next major Pathfinder Convention is one of my own, the Spring Shadowmoot,\
  \ which will be named Risen Rune in honour of the new season, running over the Labour\
  \ Day long weekend, September 28th to October 1st. There are around 60 sessions\
  \ scheduled, including all the latest scenarios from Season Three, the first scenarios\
  \ for Season Four, the Season Four multi-table special, sanctioned modules, and\
  \ Australia's first public offering of the Eyes of the Ten arc.</p> \n     <p>Currently,\
  \ our community centers around our Facebook page. Here we launch our events and\
  \ discuss Pathfinder Society play in the region, so please \"Like\" the page to\
  \ link up with us and keep up to date on what's happening.</p> \n     <p>I'd like\
  \ to say a big thank you to all of the Sydney region's Pathfinder Society event\
  \ organizers and GMs, for all their hard work and willingness to give up their time\
  \ to entertain people. I've already shouted out some of these people in the above\
  \ but there are many others, including enthusiastic players, too many to mention,\
  \ who are helping to drive the hobby forward here in Sydney. My Venture-Lieutenant,\
  \ Martin Blake, currently on secondment with the Colorado Chapter, is likely to\
  \ make the move permanent and seek a Venture Officer role there. Although he was\
  \ involved in organizing events here in Sydney for just a short time before he was\
  \ relocated, his advice and enthusiasm will be missed. I'd like to take this opportunity,\
  \ therefore, to welcome my new VL, Dave Metcalfe (aka Metz), to the role. Metz has\
  \ been my adviser and co-organizer over the last year or so, and was very active\
  \ in a previous organized play campaign. He'll be a key player in developing the\
  \ Society here in the future, and I am thankful to have him as part of my team.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>There have been several highlights in the local scene since I was appointed\
  \ Venture-Captain. In October 2011, I organized my first Sydney convention, Shadow\
  \ Lodge, and, at 31 sessions, it immediately became the biggest Pathfinder Society\
  \ event that had run in the region. In December 2011, we ran five tables of Blood\
  \ Under Absalom and had by far the largest number of sessions for any game on offer\
  \ at MacquarieCon, another of Sydney's long-running roleplaying conventions. In\
  \ April, our second Shadow Lodge convention, Ruby Phoenix, was even bigger! We had\
  \ 60 players filling 375 seats over 64 sessions, which made Ruby Phoenix the largest\
  \ Pathfinder gathering in the southern hemisphere to date!</p> \n     <div class=\"\
  blurb180\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderSociety/20120827-Flyer.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderSociety/20120827-Flyer_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>The resurrection of the organized play scene in\
  \ Canberra is also exciting in that it offers more options for more players across\
  \ the greater region. Wes Nicholson and his team are organizing the relaunch of\
  \ Spring Revel Downunder, which will be running over two weekends on Sep 28–Oct\
  \ 1 and Oct 5–8. The successful inception of Society play in Wollongong as a completely\
  \ new location is also very encouraging.</p> \n     <p>Over the course of 2012,\
  \ we're aiming to start game days at a number of other new locations. And we'll\
  \ of course continue to grow our offerings at conventions in Sydney and Canberra\
  \ to support our growing player base. We're also working on a website that will\
  \ unite the event calendars from across the region and act as a launchpad to our\
  \ various online locations of interest, such as our Facebook page and Warhorn sites.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Ultimately, the true highlight of the Pathfinder Society is through\
  \ the like-minded people you meet. It is probably this aspect that I find most satisfying\
  \ and which gives me the greatest sense of achievement. The Sydney Pathfinder Society\
  \ is developing strongly, with a great many new friendships forming as a result,\
  \ and I'm excited to be able to help facilitate and promote it.</p> \n     <p>Alistair\
  \ Rigg<br> <i>Venture-Captain, Sydney</i></p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>My heartfelt\
  \ thanks goes out to all of the Venture-Captains and Lieutenants, coordinators,\
  \ players, and GMs for making Australia an amazing area for Pathfinder Society.\
  \ Keep up the awesome work all!</p> \n    <p>Mike Brock<br> <i>Pathfinder Society\
