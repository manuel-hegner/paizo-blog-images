  \ #5</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Thursday, July 29, 2010</p> \n   <p>The <a href=\"\
  /pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8b6g\"><i>Advanced Player's Guide</i></a> releases in just\
  \ one week and already boxes and boxes are on their way to your FLGS and subscriber\
  \ copies are shipping out. One week from today, we will all be at Gen Con, handing\
  \ out copies of this meaty rulebook. But that's next week. Today we have the final\
  \ preview of the book, taking a look at prestige classes and some of the new rules\
  \ found in the APG.</p> \n   <p>There are eight prestige classes featured in the\
  \ <i>Advanced Players Guide</i>, from the mighty Stalwart Defender to the sly Master\
  \ Spy. Here is the name and brief summary of each class in the book.</p> \n   <blockquote>\
  \ \n    <p><b>Battle Herald</b>: This class blends the best of the bard and the\
  \ cavalier to create a character that can truly take control of the battlefield,\
  \ granting big bonuses to his allies.<br> <b>Holy Vindicator</b>: Mixing cleric\
  \ and paladin, the holy vindicator is the perfect weapon to deliver his deity's\
  \ will, usually at the end of a sword.<br> <b>Horizon Walker</b>: A class that nearly\
  \ anyone can qualify for, this class is perfect for adventurers that travel the\
  \ world and the planes beyond, granting a wide variety of bonuses based on terrain.<br>\
  \ <b>Master Chymist</b>: A prestige class for alchemists whose minds have split\
  \ into two because of repeated use of their mutagenâ€”now they are part monster and\
  \ part dangerous madman.<br> <b>Mastery Spy</b>: Skilled at the art of lying, able\
  \ to take on the appearance of others easily, and even able to hide their alignment\
  \ from spells, the master spy is perfect for infiltrating and hiding with the enemy.<br>\
  \ <b>Nature Warden</b>: Bonding closely with her animal companion and the lands\
  \ around her, the nature warden is a force of nature, deadly when protecting the\
  \ lands that she calls home.<br> <b>Rage Prophet</b>: Sometimes the spirits that\
  \ speak to oracles drive them into a mad, rage-filled frenzy. This mix of barbarian\
  \ and oracle is just that, blending spells and rage together.<br> <b>Stalwart Defender</b>:\
  \ This is a revision of the Dwarven Defender and it is no longer just for dwarves.\
  \ This class is known for holding its ground and taking whatever punishment the\
  \ enemy throws at it.</p> \n   </blockquote> \n  </blockquote> \n  <table border=\"\

  \ <p>Of course, that's not all that you'll find the APG. The last chapter of the\
  \ book contains a host of new rules to use in your game, starting out with four\
  \ new types of combat maneuver. The first, and perhaps my favorite, is the Dirty\
  \ Trick combat maneuver. This maneuver lets you apply a penalty (either blinded,\
  \ dazzled, deafened, entangled, shaken, or sickened) to your foe for 1 round plus\
  \ 1 round for every 5 by which your check exceeds the target's CMD. The type of\
  \ course, depends on the situation and your imagination. Kicking sand in an opponent's\
  \ face might blind him, while pulling down his pants might entangle him.</p> \n\
  \   <p>The next maneuver is Drag. This works like Bull Rush, only in reverse. Next\
  \ up is Reposition. This maneuver allows you to move your opponent to a different\
  \ location within your threatened area, but you cannot use it to move a foe into\
  \ a dangerous space, such as off a cliff or into a fire. Finally, there is Steal.\
  \ This combat maneuver lets you snatch a small item that is loosely carried by your\
  \ target. So while you cannot take the plate mail of a target or take the sword\
  \ from his hand, you can rip the brooch off his cloak. Of course, each one of these\
  \ maneuvers comes with a pair of feats (Improved and Greater) to increase your odds\
  \ of success and grant additional bonuses.</p> \n   <p>After Combat Maneuvers is\
  \ a complete system for using hero points in your game. This system grants PCs a\
  \ small pool of points that they can spend at particularly dramatic moments, giving\
  \ them an edge. The rules also include guidelines for granting new hero points,\
  \ how they can be spent, and a number of feats, magic items, and spells that use\
  \ these rules. We recognize that not everyone plays with a system like this, so\
  \ this entire rules section is optional.</p> \n   <p>Last but not least is the system\
  \ of character traits. This system first appeared in the Pathfinder Adventure Paths\
  \ and it grants PCs a pair of small bonuses tied to their background at character\
  \ creation. Your PC might bear a curious birthmark shaped like your deity's holy\
  \ symbol that you can use as a divine focus or you might have grown up as a bully\
  \ gaining a bonus on Intimidate. No matter what you choose, this system gives you\
  \ a reason to work out where your hero came from.</p> \n   <p>Well, that about wraps\
  \ up the previews of the <i>Advanced Player's Guide</i>. With the book hitting shelves\
  \ next week, I hope that you will swing by Gen Con or your favorite game store and\
  \ check it out. I would like to take a moment to thank all of the playtesters that,\
  \ once again, helped contribute to a truly great book. Until next time.</p> \n \
