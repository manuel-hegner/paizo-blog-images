  \   </div> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Though I’ve seen\
  \ all four of the quick-start characters in action, Lini’s the one that I’ve been\
  \ playing through the <i>Core Set</i> adventures, and so this strategizing has all\
  \ been firsthand. I’ve discovered that she’s a more nuanced character than she was\
  \ in the original Pathfinder Adventure Card Game sets: better balanced, and so requiring\
  \ more thoughtful play. Which is all for the best: the classic Lini made everything\
  \ a bit too easy.</p> \n     <p>So here are my thoughts on playing Lini, the second\
  \ of the Quick-Start characters from the <i>Core Set</i>—and here’s some discussion\
  \ on what “invoking the Animal trait” <i>really</i> means. You’ve very likely got\
  \ it wrong: we did for our first few games, before I sat down to write this.</p>\

  >Keith Richmond’s article</a> on Lini for more on how the character has evolved.</p>\

  \ alt=\"Lini, Character 0. Lini is a friend to all the savage beasts of the forest,\
  \ soothing their hungers and redirecting their baser instincts. With her snow leopard\
  \ Droogami nearby, she collects sticks from every forest she has visited, a wooden\
  \ road map of her travels; should she settle down, they may become a house.\"></a>\
  \ \n     </div> \n     <h3>Core Set Lini</h3> \n     <p><b>Best Skill:</b> Wisdom\
  \ (d10)</p> \n     <p><b>Character Type:</b> Warrior, Healer, Divine</p> \n    \
  \ <p><b><i>Skills.</i></b> Lini only has three “subskills”—Divine, Perception, and\
  \ Survival—but they’re all under her d10 skill, Wisdom. Of those skills, Perception\
  \ and Survival are the rarest, being featured on only three <i>Core Set</i> characters\
  \ each. Harsk has both of them (along with Fortitude and Ranged), making them a\
  \ somewhat poor pairing for an adventuring party, due to the overlap.</p> \n   \
  \  <p><i>Weaknesses.</i> Lini’s biggest weakness is her d4 Strength. Given that\
  \ she also lacks Melee and Ranged skills, and starts with just one weapon card,\
  \ she could end up rolling a horrible d4 in combat… if not for her “wild shape”\
  \ ability: the power that lets her recharge or bury a card to use Survival + 1d4\
  \ instead. So this weakness isn’t nearly as problematic as it is for other d4 Strength\
  \ characters, such as Lem.</p> \n     <p><b><i>Cards.</i></b> Besides having just\
  \ a single Weapon, Lini is also short on items (1) and blessings (2). The latter\
  \ means that she’ll have to find other ways to explore multiple times—a critical\
  \ ability for all characters. Allies (5) are her best option: she should make sure\
  \ to collect allies that permit exploration... provided that they have the Animal\
  \ trait.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/101819_CoreAllyRidingAllosaurus.jpg\"\

  \ \n     <p><i>Allies.</i> Lini should collect Animals!! (For more, see below.)</p>\
  \ \n     <p><i>Blessings.</i> Nethys’s blessings are probably the best for Lini,\
  \ as they can bless her Wisdom (and so Divine, Perception, and Survival). Alternatively,\
  \ Erastil will bless just her Survival.</p> \n     <p><i>Spells.</i> Because Lini\
  \ has both a Divine proficiency and plenty of ability to do damage via means other\
  \ than spells (namely, her wild shape power), she should stock up on healing spells;\
  \ this will make her one of the strongest healers in a party, overshadowed only\
  \ by someone like Kyra, who has a healing-oriented power feat. Take special note\
  \ of Aspect of the Monkey, the only Animal spell in the <i>Core Set.</i></p> \n\
  \     <p><i>Weapons.</i> Lini needs to watch for Dexterity weapons that do not require\
  \ proficiency. Her starting Dagger actually isn’t bad, since it can be recharged\
  \ for 2d4. Crossbows are another good choice.</p> \n     <h3>The Power of Animals</h3>\
  \ \n     <p>Lini’s best powers center around the use of Animal allies, which serve\
  \ a variety of purposes. That is why you want to fill her ally slots with Animals\
  \ (which is how her default deck is laid out) and advance to the max of 7 ally cards\
  \ as quickly as possible.</p> \n     <p><b><i>Take +1d4 to Animal Invocations as\
  \ Your First Power Feat</i></b>. Of Lini’s three basic powers, the best is obviously\
  \ the +1d4 to local checks that invoke the Animal trait. This can be used whenever\
  \ she activates her wild shape power, whenever she acquires an Animal, whenever\
  \ she fights an Animal, whenever she plays an Animal to determine the skill she’\
  s using, and whenever her friends at the same location do these same things. It’\
  s very versatile, and it’s a cooperative power. (In contrast, her least useful power\
  \ is the one that lets her discard instead of bury when using wild shape with a\
  \ non-Animal card. That’s a desperate last resort, so no need to make it cheaper.)</p>\
  \ \n     <blockquote> \n      <p><i>Clarification: What Invokes the Animal Trait?</i>\
  \ The “invoke” rule is one of the most confusing in the PACG. Page 9 of the Core\
  \ Set rules tersely defines it by saying: “A check invokes a trait if it has or\
  \ is against a card that has that trait. A card invokes a trait if it has that trait.\
  \ A bane also invokes a trait if it deals only damage of the type that matches that\
  \ trait.”</p> \n      <p>This means that the skill you’re using invokes its traits,\
  \ as do any it references (e.g., Wisdom and Survival are invoked if Lini uses her\
  \ “Survival: Wisdom +3” skill) and the card you’re facing invokes all of its traits\
  \ (e.g., Acid and Animal when you’re trying to acquire a Giant Slug, and Poison\
  \ and Animal when you’re fighting a Giant Toad). Then there’s the special case of\
  \ a bane adding an exclusive damage type as a trait. And <i>that’s it</i>.</p> \n\
  \      <p>Well, that’s mostly it. Two more special cases appear on page 11 of the\
  \ <i>Core Set</i> rules: you always add your character’s trait (e.g., Lini always\
  \ adds Gnome and Druid), and you add the traits of a card you play <i>if and only</i>\
  \ if it’s a “For your … check” card, like most weapons and Attack spells, which\
  \ essentially replaces your skill with a card (e.g., when Lini plays a Deathbane\
  \ Light Crossbow for a combat check, she would invoke Bow, Ranged, Piercing, and\
  \ Magic).</p> \n      <p>There’s one last situation when traits are invoked: if\
  \ a card, power, or scenario rule specifically says to add traits as part of its\
  \ special effect text (e.g., Lini’s wild shape ability explicitly invokes the Animal\
  \ trait).</p> \n      <p>Here’s a chart of all the traits that are actually invoked\
  \ during a check:</p> \n      <table width=\"800\" border=\"1\" style=\"margin:\
  \ 1rem 0\"> \n       <thead style=\"text-align:left;\"> \n        <tr> \n      \
  \   <th>Player Invokes</th> \n         <th>Challenge Invokes</th> \n        </tr>\
  \ \n       </thead> \n       <tbody> \n        <tr>\n         <td>Character Traits</td>\n\
  \         <td>Oppositional Card Traits</td>\n        </tr> \n        <tr>\n    \
  \     <td>Skills Used or Referenced</td>\n         <td>Exclusive Damage Type</td>\n\
  \        </tr> \n        <tr>\n         <td>“For Your … Check” Card Traits</td>\n\
  \         <td>Special Effect Traits</td>\n        </tr> \n        <tr>\n       \
  \  <td>Effect </td>\n         <td></td>\n        </tr> \n       </tbody> \n    \
  \  </table> \n      <p>Note what’s <i>not</i> included here: you don’t invoke the\
  \ traits of cards played into a check <i>other</i> than a “For your … check” card\
  \ or the oppositional card. So, if someone plays a support spell like Aid or even\
  \ Venom Blast in a support role, it doesn’t invoke its traits; if someone plays\
  \ a blessing, it doesn’t invoke its traits; and most tragically, if Lini plays a\
  \ support Animal, it doesn’t invoke the Animal trait (or anything else).</p> \n\

  \ alt=\"Giant Slug, Ally 1. Animal, Acid.\"></a> \n     </div> \n     <p><b><i>Use\
  \ Wild Shape.</i></b> Lini’s best combat ability is her wild shape, which allows\
  \ her to bury a card or recharge an Animal ally to fight at Survival + 1d4 + the\
  \ card’s level. This has a starting value of 1d10 + 3 + 1d4 + card level, for a\
  \ range of 5–17 + card level and an average of 11 + card level. Compare that to\
  \ her starting Dagger at Dexterity + 1d4 (+1d4 if recharged), which is 1d8 + 1d4\
  \ (+1d4). That totals 2–12 (3–16 if recharged) or an average of 7 (9.5 if recharged).</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Not only is the wild shape better, but it’s easier to pump up, with\
  \ the +1d4 power feat immediately improving its range to 6–21 + card level and its\
  \ average to 13.5 + card level. Keep an eye out for anything that could improve\
  \ your Wisdom or Survival, making wild shaping even better (and note that you can\
  \ always add in your Hide Armor to give yourself another +3 to combat by double-adding\
  \ your Survival modifier).</p> \n     <p>Obviously, you always want to recharge\
  \ Animals, not bury cards, to invoke wild shape. Recharging helps to cycle your\
  \ deck, while burying cards thins it and makes you more vulnerable. (Here’s another\
  \ reason to recharge Animals: you can happily declare “I turn into a giant slug”\
  \ as you play the appropriate card.)</p> \n     <p><b><i>Collect the Right Animals.</i></b>\
  \ Consider carefully if you want Lini to be a combat monster or more versatile;\
  \ this should largely depend on the composition of the rest of your party. If you\
  \ want Lini to be one of your main fighters, collect Animals like Droogami and Riding\
  \ Allosaurus, which can add to her combat stats. If you want Lini to be more versatile,\
  \ then instead go for Animals that add to other skills, like the Raccoon that adds\
  \ to Dexterity or Disable. In the latter case, you’ll <i>still</i> be recharging\
  \ the Animals to wild shape, but during the narrow window that they’re in your hand,\
  \ you might be able to use them for something else instead. (But don’t hold onto\
  \ an Animal for a specific non-combat check unless you <i>know</i> it’s in your\
  \ near future, such as a check to close your location. Else, you’ll just be clogging\
  \ your hand when you could be cycling it.) Whichever the case: collect Animal allies\
  \ exclusively and improve them as quickly as you can. Lini should <i>never</i> have\
  \ non-Animal allies, not even seductive Loot allies.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ alt=\"Lini, Role 0. World Walker. The world is her cloister.\"></a> \n     </div>\
  \ \n     <h3>The Lini Roles</h3> \n     <p>Overall, the Wild Whisperer seems like\
  \ the role that builds better on Lini’s innate abilities, but World Walker is a\
  \ nice alternative if healing or movement are missing from your party.</p> \n  \
  \   <p><b><i>Wild Whisperer.</i></b> This role improves Lini’s already great power\
  \ of Animals, allowing her to bring both her wild shape and her Animal invoke bonus\
  \ up from +1d4 to +1d6 and also allowing her to heal Animal cards (albeit at the\
  \ cost of something else). That makes it a good choice if you’ve been able to build\
  \ out Lini’s Animal allies well. The ability to turn Strength into a d10 offsets\
  \ Lini’s main deficit, which is good if it’s been causing you problems (and the\
  \ fact that you recharge a card to do so makes this power even better, because that\
  \ can again help you cycle cards that were clogging your hand). Finally, the power\
  \ feats that add Acrobatics and Fortitude skills are nice if they’ve been lacking\
  \ in your party. (That’s more likely for Acrobatics, as it appears on only three\
  \ Core Set characters.)</p> \n     <p><b><i>World Walker.</i></b> This role is much\
  \ more defensive, giving Lini elemental defenses and the ability to remove scourges.\
  \ If your party is light on healing for either damage or scourges, this might be\
  \ a good choice. Meanwhile, the ability to move at the end of a turn is nice if\
  \ your party is missing Amiri—see the upcoming fourth article in this series for\
  \ why that’s great!</p> \n    </blockquote> \n   </div> <!-- tags:  Pathfinder Adventure\
