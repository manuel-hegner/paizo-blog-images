  \ by Wayne Reynolds\n     </div> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p>Like many halflings,\
  \ Enora has always been driven by an unlikely pairing of curiosity and luck. Her\
  \ parents, both professors at Manaket’s premier arcane institution, the Occularium,\
  \ fostered in their only daughter a hunger for knowledge that was rivaled only by\
  \ her optimism and determination. Perhaps the result of her parents’ own mastery\
  \ of magic, Enora had always possessed a natural understanding of the mystical inner\
  \ workings of magic, and combining this with her fastidious research skills and\
  \ intuition, she quickly rose to the top of her class.</p> \n      <p>When she came\
  \ of age, Enora came out atop a pool of nearly a hundred applicants for a coveted\
  \ governmental position researching some of the Occularium’s most valued magical\
  \ treasures from the ancient Jistka Imperium. In this role, Enora found the perfect\
  \ fit for her curiosity, drive, and magical acumen. But years of study of even the\
  \ most esoteric and enigmatic of Jistkan relics wasn’t enough for Enora, and countless\
  \ hours in the Occularium’s library aroused in her an uncontrollable sense of wanderlust.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>To combat her growing frustration with the limits she felt her job\
  \ placed upon her ability to uncover lore, and longing to study artifacts beyond\
  \ just those of the Jistkans, Enora took a leave of absence, intending to perform\
  \ research abroad on other ancient magical empires. Her request was granted, and\
  \ she was given a year to learn what she could before returning to continue her\
  \ work in the Occularium.</p> \n      <p>Enora’s destination was the ruins of Lirgen—\
  one of the two nations completely subsumed by the Eye of Abendego just over a century\
  \ earlier—where she hoped to find recently lost information about their mastery\
  \ of astrology. The journey south along the coast of Rahadoum was uneventful, but\
  \ the harsh and unforgiving swamps of the Sodden Lands and the less than welcoming\
  \ inhabitants of the marshes therein provided Enora ample opportunities to use her\
  \ magical skills merely to survive. The excitement of adventure grabbed the halfling\
  \ during this journey, and she thought even in the earliest weeks of her sabbatical\
  \ of how very different the arcane libraries of the Occularium would feel upon her\
  \ return.</p> \n      <p>Yet it was a discovery she made in a half-drowned temple\
  \ dedicated to the magic god Nethys—the worship of whom was forbidden in her homeland—\
  that truly set Enora’s life on a new path. Within the dank and moldering sanctuary,\
  \ Enora uncovered a stone tablet that radiated a magical aura unlike anything she\
  \ had ever encountered before, even amid the most powerful of Jistkan artifacts\
  \ under her charge in the Occularium. Setting her hand upon the arcane writing and\
  \ reaching forth with her innate arcane abilities, Enora touched the very fabric\
  \ of the magical energy that pulsed through the artifact, unraveling it ever so\
  \ slightly to better understand it.</p> \n      <p>Immediately, her mind was flooded\
  \ with magical revelations, knowledge beyond her wildest dreams, and a sense of\
  \ a much vaster world of magical discovery to be explored than she had ever imagined.\
  \ When she pulled her hand away, as much in shock as in fear of overwhelming her\
  \ mind, Enora had a new understanding of the potential for learning that existed\
  \ beyond the strictly secular libraries and laboratories of Rahadoum. A combination\
  \ of rage and sadness overwhelmed her as she realized that her own rejection of\
  \ Nethys and other gods of magic had been holding her back from attaining the knowledge\
  \ she’d always yearned for. How could she return to Manaket and her governmental\
  \ position knowing that so much more information remained beyond her grasp, simply\
  \ because it was held in libraries dedicated to deities her nation had shunned?</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Enora traveled east into the Mwangi Expanse and found passage down\
  \ one of the region’s many rivers to the Arcadian Ocean, the entire time assessing\
  \ her options. Her year of research was quickly drawing to a close, and she had\
  \ to decide where she would go next. In the end, she wrote to the magistrate who\
  \ oversaw her work at the Occularium and extended her period of study abroad, then\
  \ boarded a ship set for Sothis, where she knew one of the largest temples of Nethys\
  \ to be located.</p> \n      <p>Enora chose the pursuit of knowledge over the security\
  \ of the life she’d known, and now lives a life on the edge of two worlds. She works\
  \ continually through carefully worded letters to maintain her good standing with\
  \ the Occularium in order to preserve her access to its myriad magical and academic\
  \ resources, but is afraid to return home, lest her newfound respect for the power\
  \ of the gods brings punishment upon her head. Now, Enora travels the Inner Sea\
  \ in search of a better understanding of the inner workings of magic and the secrets\
  \ of lost empires whose magic surpassed that of even the most powerful modern archmages,\
  \ utilizing whatever resources she can gain access to, be they religious or secular\
  \ in nature.</p> \n      <p>Enora is singularly driven in her search for knowledge,\
  \ but isn’t above working with others in order to achieve common goals. She remains\
  \ cheerful and optimistic about most things, yet holds deep-seated anxiety about\
  \ the conflict she will inevitably face should she return to Manaket and be outed\
  \ as a follower of Nethys. She doesn’t talk much about where she came from, but\
  \ knows that one day her travels will take her back to Rahadoum, and she’ll be hard\
  \ pressed to keep her secret.</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>Mark Moreland<br>\
