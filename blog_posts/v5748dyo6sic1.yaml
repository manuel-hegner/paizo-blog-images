  \ amazing response we have received from Pathfinder fans on the Abomination Vaults\
  \ game Kickstarter campaign! <strong>Already above 75% and going strong. </strong></p>\
  \ \n     <p>You are showing us that there’s a genuine appetite for this game, and\
  \ this gives us even more energy and enthusiasm that will in turn be channeled back\
  \ into this project. There is still some ground to cover, but everyone at BKOM wants\
  \ to thank all who have been supporting us thus far. This game wouldn’t feel as\
  \ tangible without the community’s support.</p> \n     <h3>Available on GOG</h3>\
  \ \n     <p>First, some good news: many of you have been asking for it... and today\
  \ we're super happy to give it to you!<strong><em>Pathfinder: Abomination Vaults</em>\
  \ will be available on GOG</strong>! At the end of our campaign, pledgers will be\
  \ able to choose through a form we'll send you whether you'd like to receive your\
  \ digital copy of the game for Steam or GOG.</p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Two Stretch\
  \ Goals Revealed</h3> \n     <p>As we are getting closer to our main funding goal,\
  \ the time has come to share with you the <strong>first two Stretch Goals</strong>\
  \ of our campaign. We are pretty excited about them! We've received a lot of feedback\
  \ and questions from the community regarding customization, so we know many of you\
  \ will be thrilled to learn these Stretch Goals are all about <strong>giving players\
  \ more customization options</strong> that will enhance the way you play and look\
  \ in the game.</p> \n     <p>Introducing <strong>Nezrin Fizzletop’s Alchemitorium</strong>,\
  \ a potion-crafting system, and <strong>Talia’s Tailoring Emporium</strong>, a wardrobe\
  \ system that will come with the<strong> Brimstone Set</strong>, an awesome alternative\
  \ outfit. We’ll give you more details on these in the next few days!</p> \n    \
  \ <br> \n     <h3>Add-ons</h3> \n     <p>Last week, we introduced some <strong>new\
  \ add-ons</strong> to the campaign. We added the possibility to <strong>add an Extra\
  \ Digital download</strong> (Steam) for all our pledgers. For those who pledged\
  \ to one of our Collector’s boxes or Special Tiers, we also added the option to\
  \ complete your miniature collection in order to get the full party of four, and\
  \ the possibility to add the <strong>Custom Dice Set &amp; Bag </strong>designed\
  \ by FanRoll.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/f09a5eb1-6c4a-40f0-b723-06ee90905a42/BKOM_KickstarterDiceBag.png\"\

  \ physical shippable add-ons will only be available for backers already pledging\
  \ for a shippable reward. But please note that pledgers will be able to add digital\
  \ rewards as add-ons at the end of the campaign via the Pledge Manager.</p> \n \
  \    <br> \n     <h3>Miniatures Reveal</h3> \n     <p>We were also thrilled to reveal\
  \ a sneak peek of Ezren and Amiri’s <strong>exclusive miniatures</strong>. We’ll\
  \ make you wait a bit more to discover Harsk and Kyra, but know that our design\
  \ team is putting the finishing touch on them, making sure they look amazing.</p>\

  \ of you in the community asked for it, we decided to add a new digital bundle to\
  \ the campaign: the <strong>Double-Up Digital Bundle</strong>. With this bundle,\
  \ you’ll get two digital downloads of the game (Steam) for you and a friend to partner\
  \ up and play <em>Pathfinder: Abomination Vaults</em>.</p> \n     <p>And we’re not\
  \ done yet! We love receiving feedback from the community about our current rewards\
  \ and getting ideas on what you would like. We’re still early in the campaign and\
  \ many surprises are still yet to come.</p> \n     <p>Please continue to spread\
  \ the word and watch this space as more exciting stuff is about to be revealed!\
  \ Be sure to join the <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/AmmjVMDAym\">conversation\
  \ on Discord</a> to help us shape the rest of the campaign. Let’s turn this epic\
  \ quest into a reality! We are working hard at it.</p> \n     <center>\n      <h2><a\
