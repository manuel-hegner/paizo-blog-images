  \ \n  <blockquote> \n   <h1><br>The Fabled Appendix – Erik Mona (Part 3)</h1> \n\
  \   <p class=\"date\">Friday, February 20, 2009</p> \n   <p>In the second part of\
  \ my interview with Erik Mona about which books, movies, and other resources he\
  \ would include in Paizo's Appendix N, he explained how the idea of a devil-worshiping\
  \ colonial power—the concept of which eventually became the feared nation of Cheliax—\
  began as a faction in a miniatures game that he developed in his free time. In this\
  \ conclusion, Erik reveals that several other nations of Golarion, including Andoran\
  \ and the Land of the Linnorm Kings, had their beginnings in his miniatures game\
  \ as well. Of course, no version of the fabled Appendix N would be complete without\
  \ a list of inspiration and educational reading, and Erik admirably provides a hefty\
  \ list of source material!</p> \n   <blockquote> \n    <p><b>Erik</b>: Another colonial\
  \ power in the miniatures game was the Vikings; the fact that I am from Minnesota,\
  \ am a fan of the Vikings football team, am of Scandinavian ancestry, and am a fan\
  \ of Vikings as a sword and sorcery archetype in general, made their conclusion\
  \ pretty much inevitable. A lot of S&amp;S authors, such as Robert E. Howard and\
  \ Poul Anderson, pulled the Icelandic sagas into their own worlds. I wanted to bring\
  \ this archetype into the world of Pathfinder.</p> \n    <p>Before we began working\
  \ on <i>Pathfinder</i>, I created a homebrew setting for my own games. While I never\
  \ got the chance to play in the world, the very first region I detailed in this\
  \ setting was the realm of the Vikings, which I called the Land of the Linnorm Kings;\
  \ when we created Golarion, I imported this realm, name and all, directly into the\
  \ world. A number of sources influenced my vision of the Vikings: the Icelandic\
  \ sagas, Poul Anderson's <i>The Valor of Cappen Varra</i>, <i>The 13th Warrior</i>,\
  \ a number of different history books about the Vikings, and my own visits to Norway.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Another faction in the miniatures game included a fantasy version of\
  \ colonial America as well as a faction inspired by Revolutionary France. Thus,\
  \ Andoran and Galt were part of my conception of Golarion right from the beginning.\
  \ A number of books influenced my conception of the Revolutionary faction, such\
  \ as Claude Manceron's 5-book series <i>The Age of the French Revolution</i> about\
  \ France in the years leading up to the Revolution, and Simon Schama's <i>Citizens</i>—\
  I loved the idea of how the revolution started with idealistic intentions but then\
  \ went horribly wrong.</p> \n    <p>A number of sources inspired the creation of\
  \ other regions in Golarion: Irrisen is essentially the realm of the White Queen\
  \ of Narnia meets Baba Yaga; the Realm of the Mammoth Lords was designed as an homage\
  \ to classic Lost World tales of megafauna and giants, as well as Hollow Earth-style\
  \ settings of the kind Edgar Rice Burroughs created; Numeria could best be described\
  \ as <i>Expedition to the Barrier Peaks</i> meets <i>Thundarr the Barbarian</i>;\
  \ Mendev was inspired by tales of the Crusades, and has elements of the Demon War\
  \ from John Ostrander's <i>GrimJack</i> comic book, the Swarm from Hugh Cook's novels,\
  \ and the forces of Chaos from <i>Warhammer Fantasy</i>; the primary sources of\
  \ inspiration for the River Kingdoms were the Bandit Kingdoms of <i>Greyhawk</i>\
  \ and the Young Kingdoms from Michael Moorcock's Elric series; Taldor was inspired\
  \ by the climate and visuals of the Crusader kingdoms in the Holy Land, as well\
  \ as the cultural decadence of Ancient Rome and pre-Revolution France; and Absalom\
  \ was heavily influenced by HBO's <i>Rome series</i>, which depicted noble families\
  \ whose lineages stretch back thousands of years, while the <i>Starstone</i> and\
  \ the religious faiths with which it is associated are an obvious parallel of Jerusalem.\
  \ The <i>Starstone</i> itself is inspired by the Kaaba in Mecca, and was named after\
  \ a short story by Henry Kuttner and C. L. Moore titled <i>The Quest of the Starstone</i>.\
  \ Planet Stories has reprinted <i>Quest of the Starstone</i> in both <a href=\"\
  http://paizo.com/planetStories/v5748btpy7zdo\"><i>Northwest of Earth</i></a> and\
  \ <a href=\"http://paizo.com/planetStories/v5748btpy7x8d\"><i>Black God's Kiss</i></a>,\
  \ by C. L. Moore.</p> \n   </blockquote> \n   <p>Thanks for reading, Paizonians!\
  \ Stay tuned for more interviews with Paizo staff members as we continue to expand\
  \ Paizo's Appendix N!</p> \n   <p>David Eitelbach<br> Editorial Intern</p> \n  </blockquote>\
