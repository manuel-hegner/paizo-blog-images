  \  <p itemprop=\"description\">For the last several weeks, as rumors of Wizards\
  \ of the Coast’s new version of the Open Game License began circulating among publishers\
  \ and on social media, gamers across the world have been asking what Paizo plans\
  \ to do in light of concerns regarding Wizards of the Coast’s rumored plan to de-authorize\
  \ the existing OGL 1.0(a). We have been awaiting further information, hoping that\
  \ Wizards would realize that, for more than 20 years, the OGL has been a mutually\
  \ beneficial license which should not–and cannot–be revoked. While we continue to\
  \ await an answer from Wizards, we strongly feel that Paizo can no longer delay\
  \ making our own feelings about the importance of Open Gaming a part of the public\
  \ discussion. </p> \n     <p>We believe that any interpretation that the OGL 1.0\
  \ or 1.0(a) were intended to be revocable or able to be deauthorized is incorrect,\
  \ and with good reason.</p> \n     <p>We were there.</p> \n     <p>Paizo owner Lisa\
  \ Stevens and Paizo president Jim Butler were leaders on the Dungeons &amp; Dragons\
  \ team at Wizards at the time. Brian Lewis, co-founder of Azora Law, the intellectual\
  \ property law firm that Paizo uses, was the attorney at Wizards who came up with\
  \ the legal framework for the OGL itself. Paizo has also worked very closely on\
  \ OGL-related issues with Ryan Dancey, the visionary who conceived the OGL in the\
  \ first place. </p> \n     <p>Paizo does not believe that the OGL 1.0a can be “\
  deauthorized,” ever. While we are prepared to argue that point in a court of law\
  \ if need be, we don’t want to have to do that, and we know that many of our fellow\
  \ publishers are not in a position to do so. </p> \n     <p>We have no interest\
  \ whatsoever in Wizards’ new OGL. Instead, we have a plan that we believe will irrevocably\
  \ and unquestionably keep alive the spirit of the Open Game License.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>As Paizo has evolved, the parts of the OGL that we ourselves value have changed.\
  \ When we needed to quickly bring out Pathfinder First Edition to continue publishing\
  \ our popular monthly adventures back in 2008, using Wizards’ language was important\
  \ and expeditious. But in our non-RPG products, including our Pathfinder Tales novels,\
  \ the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game, and others, we shifted our focus away from\
  \ D&amp;D tropes to lean harder into ideas from our own writers. By the time we\
  \ went to work on Pathfinder Second Edition, Wizards of the Coast’s Open Game Content\
  \ was significantly less important to us, and so our designers and developers wrote\
  \ the new edition without using Wizards’ copyrighted expressions of any game mechanics.\
  \ While we still published it under the OGL, the reason was no longer to allow Paizo\
  \ to use Wizards’ expressions, but to allow other companies to use our expressions.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>We believe, as we always have, that open gaming makes games better,\
  \ improves profitability for all involved, and enriches the community of gamers\
  \ who participate in this amazing hobby. And so we invite gamers from around the\
  \ world to join us as we begin the next great chapter of open gaming with the release\
  \ of a new open, perpetual, and <em>irrevocable</em> <b>Open RPG Creative License\
  \ (ORC)</b>.</p> \n     <p>The new Open RPG Creative License will be built system\
  \ agnostic for independent game publishers under the legal guidance of <a href=\"\
  mailto:OpenRPG@azoralaw.com\">Azora Law</a>, an intellectual property law firm that\
  \ represents Paizo and several other game publishers. Paizo will pay for this legal\
  \ work. We invite game publishers worldwide to join us in support of this system-agnostic\
  \ license that allows all games to provide their own unique open rules reference\
  \ documents that open up their individual game systems to the world. To join the\
  \ effort and provide feedback on the drafts of this license, <a href=\"https://email.paizo.com/p/4XTJ-7AU/thank-you\"\
  >please sign up by using this form</a>.</p> \n     <p>In addition to Paizo, Kobold\
  \ Press, Chaosium, Green Ronin, Legendary Games, Rogue Genius Games, and a growing\
  \ list of publishers have already agreed to participate in the Open RPG Creative\
  \ License, and in the coming days we hope and expect to add substantially to this\
  \ group.</p> \n     <p>The ORC will not be owned by Paizo, nor will it be owned\
  \ by any company who makes money publishing RPGs. Azora Law’s ownership of the process\
  \ and stewardship should provide a safe harbor against any company being bought,\
  \ sold, or changing management in the future and attempting to rescind rights or\
  \ nullify sections of the license. Ultimately, we plan to find a nonprofit with\
  \ a history of open source values to own this license (such as the <a href=\"https://www.linuxfoundation.org/\"\
  >Linux Foundation</a>). </p> \n     <p>Of course, Paizo plans to continue publishing\
  \ Pathfinder and Starfinder, even as we move away from the Open Gaming License.\
  \ Since months’ worth of products are still at the printer, you’ll see the familiar\
  \ OGL 1.0(a) in the back of our products for a while yet. While the Open RPG Creative\
  \ License is being finalized, we’ll be printing Pathfinder and Starfinder products\
  \ without any license, and we’ll add the finished license to those products when\
  \ the new license is complete. </p> \n     <p>We hope that you will continue to\
  \ support Paizo and other game publishers in this difficult time for the entire\
  \ hobby. You can do your part by supporting the many companies that have provided\
  \ content under the OGL. Support Pathfinder and Starfinder by visiting your local\
  \ game store, <a href=\"https://paizo.com/store/subscriptions\">subscribing to Pathfinder\
  \ and Starfinder</a>, or taking advantage of discount code <b>OpenGaming</b> during\
