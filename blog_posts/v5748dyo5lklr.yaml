  description\">With the <a href=\"/pathfinderplaytest\">Pathfinder Playtest</a>,\
  \ we're looking to level up the entire Pathfinder game. And that means leveling\
  \ up... leveling up! Gaining new levels and the toys that come with them is a core\
  \ part of Pathfinder First Edition, and we want to make it more rewarding in the\
  \ new edition. So how do you level up?</p> \n     <p>Well, first you're going to\
  \ need some Experience Points. You can get those XP by fighting monsters, encountering\
  \ traps, solving puzzles, and accomplishing goals. Once you hit <b>1,000 XP</b>,\
  \ you level up! (That's for every level, so whenever you have 500 XP, you'll always\
  \ know you're halfway to leveling up again! And if you have any extra Experience\
  \ Points after leveling up, they count toward the next level.)</p> \n     <p>Once\
  \ you have enough Experience Points to level up, you'll increase your proficiencies,\
  \ then get some more Hit Points (8 + Constitution modifier for a cleric, for example),\
  \ and then get to make the choices for your new level. What choices? Those are all\
  \ covered on your class's class advancement table. For instance, at 2nd and 3rd\
  \ levels, the cleric gets the following: </p>\n     <table>\n      <tbody>\n   \
  \    <tr>\n        <td>2</td>\n        <td>Cleric feat, skill feat</td>\n      \
  \ </tr> \n       <tr>\n        <td>3</td>\n        <td>2nd-level spells, general\
  \ feat, skill increase</td>\n       </tr>\n      </tbody>\n     </table> \n    \
  \ <p>(<i>Wait... what if I multiclass?</i> We'll cover that in a future blog, but\
  \ let's just say you'll still be referencing only one advancement table.)</p> \n\
  \     <p>One thing we knew we wanted to include in the new edition was a good number\
  \ of choices for all characters. In first edition, this could be pretty unequal.\
  \ Even though over time, the game incorporated more ways to customize any type of\
  \ character, we wanted to build in more robust customization into the structure\
  \ of every class. That's why every class gets specific class talents (which include\
  \ spells for spellcasters) at 1st level and every other level thereafter, increases\
  \ to skills every other level, and feats at every level!</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  ></a> \n      <p><i>Illustration by Wayne Reynolds</i></p>\n     </div> \n     <h2>Feats\
  \ Feats Feats!</h2> \n     <p>How does gaining feats at every level shake out? Every\
  \ class has special feats just for them, which you gain every other level. When\
  \ your cleric hits 2nd level and gets that cleric feat, do you want to become a\
  \ better healer? Learn another of your deity's domains? Turn undead away from you?\
  \ Your class feats give you these options, so you're not locked into the same path\
  \ as every other cleric.</p> \n     <p>On any level when you don't gain a class\
  \ feat, you gain a skill feat to change the ways you can use skills, a general feat\
  \ that's useful to any character regardless of class, or an ancestry feat that reflects\
  \ the training or advantages of your people. Skill feats are part of the general\
  \ feat category, too, so if you really want to invest in your skills, you can drop\
  \ 15 feats on improving them!</p> \n     <p>Many of your feats—especially class\
  \ feats—give you new actions, activities, and so on that you can use. They have\
  \ a special format to tell you how they work with your three actions and one reaction.\
  \ Formatting them this way means that it's easier to tell whether a feat is something\
  \ you can always do or a special action you can take. In Pathfinder First Edition\
  \ terms, this would be like the difference between Weapon Focus and Vital Strike.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>One of our goals with feats was to make them easier to choose and to\
  \ use. Most feats require very few prerequisites, so you won't need to worry about\
  \ picking a feat you really don't want in order to eventually get one you do. Any\
  \ prerequisites build off your level, your proficiency, and any previous feats the\
  \ new feat builds onto.</p> \n     <h2>The Best of Your Ability</h2> \n     <p>You'll\
  \ also amp up several of your ability scores every 5 levels. The process might be\
  \ familiar to those of you who've been playing Starfinder for the last several months!\
  \ There are, of course, a few tweaks, and we made all ability boosts work the same\
  \ way instead of being different at 1st level. Learn it once, use it in perpetuity.</p>\
  \ \n     <h2>Second Chances</h2> \n     <p>So you get all these choices. Let's say\
  \ you make a few bad ones. It happens!</p> \n     <p>Retraining your abilities is\
  \ now in the game from the get-go, covered by the downtime system. You can spend\
  \ your downtime to swap out choices you made for other ones. (Though you can't swap\
  \ out ones that are a core part of your character, like your ancestry, unless you\
  \ work out a way to do so with your GM.</p> \n     <p>Some classes give you ways\
  \ to retrain your choices automatically. For instance, some spells get less useful\
  \ as you go up in level, so spontaneous spellcasters get to replace some of the\
  \ spells they know with other ones when they get new spells.</p> \n     <h2>Leveling\
  \ in the Playtest</h2> \n     <p>The playtest adventure will have you playing characters\
  \ at various levels, and tells you when to level them up (or tells you to create\
  \ new characters for certain chapters). Our goal has been to make your options expansive\
  \ and satisfying, but not overwhelming. We look forward to you telling us which\
  \ decisions you're making, trading tips with fellow players, and agonizing over\
  \ two feats when you <i>really want them both</i>.</p> \n     <p>Logan Bonner<br>\
