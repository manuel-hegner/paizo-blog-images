  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">Hello,\
  \ gamers, and welcome again to RPG Superstar 2014! I'm Sean K Reynolds, host of\
  \ this year's RPG Superstar competition, designer at Paizo, and a judge for the\
  \ previous four RPG Superstar competitions.</span></p> \n    <p>Tomorrow, January\
  \ 1, 2014, at 2 PM Pacific time, is the deadline for your Wondrous Item submission\
  \ for Round 1! If you haven't submitted your item yet, remember to set aside a little\
  \ bit of time between now and the deadline. If this deadline has caught you by surprise\
  \ and you're not prepared, <b>do not let that stop you from entering this competition</b>.\
  \ Submit an item. Jot something down, fiddle with it for a few minutes, and submit\
  \ it. We've had people make it into the Top 32 who have never played the Pathfinder\
  \ RPG—whether you're a GM or a player, you should give it a shot. You can't win\
  \ the competition if you don't submit a wondrous item (and you can't advance to\
  \ the later rounds if you don't submit a wondrous item for Round 1).</p> \n    <p>Here's\
  \ some last-minute advice for people who haven't submitted an item yet:</p> \n \
  \   <ul> \n     <li><b>1) Use the magic item format provided in the Round 1 Rules.</b><br>\
  \ <a href=\"/rpgsuperstar/round1Rules\">Double-check the rules here</a>. Not only\
  \ does this make your submission look better, but it helps make sure you don't accidentally\
  \ leave out an important part of the item stat block, like the Price or Slot.</li>\
  \ \n     <li><b>2) Preview your item on the site before you hit \"Submit.\"</b><br>\
  \ When you use the submission tool on the <a href=\"m/rpgsuperstar\">main RPG Superstar\
  \ page</a>, remember that it works just like a message board post—you can and should\
  \ hit \"Preview\" to see how your item looks. It should look similar to a magic\
  \ item entry in the Core Rulebook. Maybe you accidentally turned everything bold\
  \ or italic, or have an extra return in the middle of a sentence. Now is the time\
  \ to fix these problems. And, before you hit \"Submit\"...</li> \n     <li><b>3)\
  \ Check your word count.</b><br> When you preview your item, scroll all the way\
  \ up and look above your username and avatar picture—right there should be your\
  \ item's name, a dash, and how many words are in your magic item. There is a hard\
  \ limit of 300 words for your wondrous item—if you're over 300 words, you're automatically\
  \ disqualified. If your item is over 300 words, trim some words out of its description\
  \ (don't trim words like Aura, Slot, or Price... those are required). If you're\
  \ at 290 or so, double-check to make sure you haven't left out any spaces between\
  \ words (especially between the item's Price or Cost and the abbreviation \"gp\"\
  \ ... there has to be a space there). Make sure your item's name is also in the\
  \ body of the post, not just the subject—that counts toward your word count. Once\
  \ you've made your adjustments, hit Preview again to look at it one more time.</li>\
  \ \n     <li><b>4) Save a copy of your final item.</b><br> Select it, copy it, paste\
  \ it into a text file or word processor, and save it for later. You'll want a record\
  \ of it, just in case you don't make it into the Top 32 and want feedback on your\
  \ item (technically we can look up items later, but it's a lot easier if you have\
  \ a copy).</li> \n     <li><b>5) Click \"Submit.\"</b><br> You're done, no going\
  \ back! Congratulations, you've made the plunge.</li> \n    </ul> \n    <p>Good\
  \ luck!</p> \n    <p>Sean K Reynolds<br> <i>Host, Designer, Former RPG Superstar\
