  \ <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Today, we’re excited to launch\
  \ a new landing page featuring all the information fans, content creators, and other\
  \ publishers need to legally use Paizo’s intellectual property—game rules, setting\
  \ details, artwork, logos, and other copyrights and trademarks—in their own products.\
  \ Whether you’re looking to make an online rules database using the ORC license,\
  \ a setting compatible with Pathfinder Second Edition, an adventure set in the Pact\
  \ Worlds system, an actual play podcast, or a series of handmade plushies of iconic\
  \ heroes like Valeros, Seoni, and Lem, we’ve got everything you need at <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/licenses\"><strong>paizo.com/licenses</strong></a>.</p>\n    \
  \  <p>Along with this new hub of information, we also made a few updates and revisions\
  \ to our existing licenses, both for ease of use and to bring them up to date with\
  \ the current state of our games and brands. You can find out more about these specific\
  \ licenses on their respective pages on the site.</p>\n      <br>\n      <h2>Paizo\
  \ Compatibility License</h2>\n      <p>With Pathfinder (and soon Starfinder) in\
  \ its second edition, we were starting to get a bit of a glut of system-specific\
  \ compatibility licenses. So, we consolidated what was previously two distinct Pathfinder\
  \ RPG Compatibility Licenses and a Starfinder Compatibility License into a single\
  \ Paizo Compatibility License. Using the new license, a publisher can declare compatibility\
  \ with any of our games and use the appropriate logo, and we don’t have to constantly\
  \ maintain the list of products and game systems you can use it for.</p>\n     \
  \ <p>We also got rid of the registration process by which publishers had to inform\
  \ us they were using the license. Now, you agree to the license when you publish\
  \ something using it, the same way you do for the OGL or ORC. Your use of one of\
  \ the Compatibility Logos or our proprietary Pathfinder-Icons font aren’t locked\
  \ behind any red tape. Just create your content, ensure you’re following all the\
  \ rules of the license, and you’re ready to go.</p>\n      <br>\n      <h2>Pathfinder\
  \ and Starfinder Infinite</h2>\n      <p>In October, on the eve of the Pathfinder\
  \ Second Edition Remaster Project launch, we announced that the ORC license wouldn’\
  t be usable on our Pathfinder and Starfinder Infinite community content publishing\
  \ platforms. While this initially caused a bit of confusion, in the months since,\
  \ we’ve seen publishers continue using both platforms with great success, accessing\
  \ Paizo’s IP via the Infinite License alone.</p>\n      <p>Next month, with the\
  \ release of <em>Pathfinder Player Core 2</em>, we’ll have completed the 18-month\
  \ task of divesting our core game from the OGL, and thus, starting on September\
  \ 1, 2024, publishing of new OGL content on Pathfinder and Starfinder Infinite will\
  \ cease; publishers wishing to release game content on either platform will need\
  \ to use the Infinite license exclusively.</p>\n      <p>This means that until Starfinder\
  \ Second Edition is officially out in just over a year, Starfinder content on the\
  \ platform is going to need to be free of rules (setting lore, fiction, art assets,\
  \ etc.) but once the new edition of the game is out, we plan to relaunch Starfinder\
  \ Infinite in style. It also means that Pathfinder First Edition content, or Pathfinder\
  \ Second Edition content based on OGL material, will also sunset from the platform\
  \ in just over a month. So, if you have a Pathfinder product in the works featuring\
  \ chuuls, the eight schools of magic, or yes, even drow, you have until the end\
  \ of August to release them. We won’t be removing OGL-based content from the marketplace\
  \ in September, but you won’t be able to release new material using the OGL after\
  \ that point.</p>\n      <p>The Infinite FAQ and End User Licensing Agreement on\
  \ the marketplaces will be updated closer to the date of the actual change, but\
  \ consider this your fair warning.</p>\n      <br>\n      <h2>Fan Content Policy</h2>\n\
  \      <p>As of today, Paizo’s Community Use Policy has been replaced by the Paizo\
  \ Fan Content Policy, which serves a similar role, but with different provisions.</p>\n\
  \      <p>First, the Fan Content Policy will allow you to sell merchandise using\
  \ our IP. Yes, for money. You will also be able to monetize other content using\
  \ Paizo’s IP, like putting a live play of one of our Adventure Paths behind a Patreon\
  \ paywall. There are restrictions to this, however, so make sure you read the license\
  \ carefully before you put in your order with the factory to make high-end poster\
  \ maps of Golarion. Anything you sell needs to be made by you and sold directly\
  \ by you to the consumer. You can’t upload a bunch of our art to one of those print-on-demand\
  \ shops that will let anyone put the art on whatever hat or mug or shirt they want.\
  \ You can screen print shirts or sew your own plushies and sell them on an Etsy\
  \ storefront you operate or at conventions, but not mass produce either or sell\
  \ them through external services or storefronts. But those Pathfinder Society faction\
  \ dice bags you have been making because you love them? You can totally start selling\
  \ those now instead of just giving them away for free.</p>\n      <p>Most of what\
  \ you could previously do with the Community Use Policy is still permitted under\
  \ the Fan Content Policy except for making RPG products, which you’ll need to release\
  \ through the Pathfinder or Starfinder Infinite storefronts (even for free if you\
  \ want) from now on. So, you can’t use art from the blog or setting material from\
  \ Golarion to make your own rulebook or adventure under this license. If you’re\
  \ currently using the OGL or ORC in conjunction with the Community Use Policy, in\
  \ order to be compliant with the new Fan Content Policy you’ll need to either remove\
  \ any game rules that would require you to use cite those licenses or remove any\
  \ non-rule content you accessed via the Community Use Policy.</p>\n      <p>We know\
  \ that all this legal stuff can be intimidating and confusing for many fans, and\
  \ for that, we apologize. It’s our hope that these changes largely improve the community’\
  s ability to create and engage with our brands, our games, and each other, even\
  \ if they’re different than what we’ve offered in the past. Be sure to check out\
  \ each license’s FAQ for more information, or pose your questions in the forums\
  \ or comments below. We’ll do our best to answer them in as timely and clear manner\
  \ as possible.</p>\n      <p>Now go out there and start creating! We can’t wait\
  \ to see what you have in store for us.</p>\n      <p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\
