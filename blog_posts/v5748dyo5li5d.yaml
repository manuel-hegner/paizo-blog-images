  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, October 20, 2015</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"\
  > \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">During PaizoCon 2015, we stood onstage with\
  \ designer Liz Spain and revealed that the next <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame\"\
  >Pathfinder Adventure Card Game</a> Adventure Path would be <em>Mummy's Mask</em>.\
  \ And we said that we'd be releasing it in February. As it turns out, we're right\
  \ an even 50 percent of the time.</p> \n    <p>Since the announcement, we've received\
  \ a lot of feedback from customers, retailers, and distributors that our release\
  \ schedule is outpacing all but our most enthusiastic players. People are still\
  \ playing <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/skullAndShackles\"><em>Skull &amp;\
  \ Shackles</em></a>, or even <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/riseOfTheRunelords\"\
  ><em>Rise of the Runelords</em></a>, and they aren't ready for a new set yet. So\
  \ we've decided to delay <em>Mummy's Mask</em> until we feel the market is ready.\
  \ That may mean July, and it may mean October, but it definitely doesn't mean February.\
  \ When we commit to a firm date, we'll let you know. But fear not—it will come.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>But wait a minute, you say—what if you <i>are</i> one of our most enthusiastic\
  \ players? No worries. There's going to be plenty to keep you busy. We'll continue\
  \ to release Class Decks: In the first five months of 2016, you can expect to see\
  \ the Oracle, Alchemist, Inquisitor, Witch, and Gunslinger decks. We're even increasing\
  \ the number of newly designed boons in some of those decks. (Hint: Damiel gets\
  \ a pet giant slug.)</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6813-GiantSlug.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6813-GiantSlug_180.jpeg\"></a>\n   \
  \  <br> <i>Yikes!</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>So great! That's a whole lot of new characters\
  \ and boons, but what are you going to do with them? Where are the new <i>scenarios</i>\
  \ to play through? If you've played through <em>Rise of the Runelords</em> (maybe\
  \ a couple times), completed <em>Skull &amp; Shackles</em>, and sailed through <a\
  \ href=\"\">Season of the Shackles</a>, you're probably just waiting for us to release\
  \ the end of <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/wrathOfTheRighteous\"><em>Wrath\
  \ of the Righteous</em></a> and <a href=\"\">Season of the Righteous</a>... and\
  \ you need MORE!</p> \n    <p>Well, we have just the thing. We're pleased to announce\
  \ the next Pathfinder Society Adventure Card Guild season:</p> \n    <h2>Season\
  \ of the Runelords</h2> \n    <p>Imagine that you decided to release a game based\
  \ on a system you created, and you wanted the most sweeping story to go with it.\
  \ Some full-on epic thing. It's no accident that the <em>Rise of the Runelords</em>\
  \ base set was one of the biggest sellers in Paizo's history—that story is really,\
  \ really good. It's chock full of giants and dragons and ogres and all manner of\
  \ malevolent things.</p> \n    <p>So we're going back to the well. A whole lot of\
  \ you own <em>Runelords</em>, and we want that to be something you can play for\
  \ a long, long time. We're making a brand-new, epic Season of the Runelords, spanning\
  \ the entire length of the story. But we might mix things up a little bit. Okay,\
  \ a whole lot. Because you can only burn down Sandpoint Cathedral so many times.\
  \ (Ten, fifteen times, tops.)</p> \n    <p>And hey, remember this ol' horsey-monster?\
  \ And this bad mamma-jamma?</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\

  \ we never actually used them as villains for a scenario? Well, we've got plans\
  \ for them. Big, big plans.</p> \n    <p>This will also harmonize with Obsidian's\
  \ release of the PACG digital game, which (surprise!) will start with Rise of the\
  \ Runelords. So we've been looking back at Runelords to see where we can improve\
  \ it a little bit for the digital version. Nips and tucks, mostly. But we think\
  \ you'll like what you see. And it'll tie in nicely with what we do in the Adventure\
  \ Card Guild.</p> \n    <p>Season of the Runelords will begin early next year. It'll\
  \ be glorious! Come play!</p> \n    <p>Mike Selinker and Tanis O'Connor<br> <i>Adventure\

  \ Guild Fans:</b> We've designed a fifth scenario in Season of the Righteous Adventure\
  \ 5, so 5D will come out this week, 5E next week, and Adventure 6 will begin one\
  \ week later than <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lhcs\">originally planned</a>,\
