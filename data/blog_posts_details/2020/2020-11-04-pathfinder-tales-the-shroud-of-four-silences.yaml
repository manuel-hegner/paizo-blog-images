  alt: "A small settlement of mostly wooden structures takes up most of a small clearing\
    \ along a rocky coastline. Mountains and woodlands occupy the surrounding areas.\
    \ A tall tower rises from the woods nearby. Other prominent features are an opulent\
    \ temple of blue and white, the town’s tallest structure, and a long log flume\
    \ jutting out over the sea."
