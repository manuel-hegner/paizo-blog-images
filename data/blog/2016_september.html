               <p>But enough about comics! This space is for miniatures, and this week I've got two fantastic figures to show you from <a href="/products/btpy9kcu"><em>Deadly Foes</em></a>!</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160930-AngelkinPaladin.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160930-AngelkinPaladin_360.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Ardent watchers of this space have been predicting this Angelkin Paladin from the first day we revealed the set's packaging, and here he is in all his celestial glory! Based off of a character who shows up semi-frequently in our interior illustrations, as well as on covers like <a href="/products/btpy8sa7"><em>Pathfinder Player Companion: Blood of Angels</em></a>. The clear plastic effects on his flaming sword and glowing halo make quite the impression upon evil foes, or even goodly folks who happen to be in his way. The Angelkin Paladin is a Medium, rare figure.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160930-Shensen.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160930-Shensen_360.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Last up this week is another Medium, rare figure, and what a rare figure it is indeed. Here we have Paizo Creative Director James Jacobs's personal character, Shensen! James has played many different versions of this swashbuckling bard over his RPG career, but two of them are my favorites. First, of course, is the version that appeared in the <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/hellsRebels">Hell's Rebels Adventure Path</a>. That appearance, in the blockbuster <a href="/products/btpy9grm"><em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #100</em></a>, came with a nice Wayne Reynolds painting of Shensen that now hangs in James's office (which, incidentally, is right next to mine—I can hear him through the wall as I type this). But an even better version of Shensen, or at least one that's more meaningful to me personally, is the version James played in my old Kings of Absalom office campaign, where she was one of many stars of the show. Shensen as presented in <a href="/products/btpy9kcu"><em>Deadly Foes</em></a> makes a fantastic player character or NPC, whether good or evil. Shensen, is a Medium, rare figure.</p> 
               <p>That's it for this week. I'm off to New York Comic Con! See you in two weeks!</p> 
               <p>Until then, I remain...</p>

               <p>And so, with his usual pluck and aplomb, editor Josh Vogt read through a bunch of interviews and listened to podcasts in which Erik, Rob, Owen, and I shot off our mouths about the new game, and collated the most important points here.

                <a href="/image/content/Starfinder/StarfinderPoster.jpg"><img src="/image/content/Starfinder/StarfinderPoster_360.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <i>Illustration by Kiki Moch Rizky</i>
               </div> 
               <h2>The Products</h2> 
               <ul>
                <li>The Core Rulebook and first Adventure Path volume will release in August 2017, at Gen Con.</li> 
                <li>It's a science-fantasy RPG based on the Pathfinder universe and rules, but complete and standalone.</li> 
                <li>It's "conceptually compatible" with Pathfinder, with the specific idea that you should be able to use Pathfinder monsters in Starfinder with a minimum of conversion fuss at the table.</li> 
                <li>While there will be occasional rules supplements like bestiaries, the Starfinder Adventure Path will be a primary vector for new rules and setting information. Overall, we expect to release products for Starfinder at a much slower rate than we do for Pathfinder, making it easier and more affordable to stay up to date on both games.</li> 
                <li>Starfinder Adventure Path and the Starfinder RPG rulebook line will not be replacing Pathfinder—it's a whole separate game, and thus not expected to impact the production of our normal Pathfinder material after the initial release.</li>
               </ul> 
               <h2>The Setting</h2> 
               <ul>
                <li>It's set in Golarion's solar system, far in a possible future in which Golarion is missing—the gods say it's safe, but won't say what happened to it. In its former orbit is a massive space platform called Absalom Station.</li> 
                <li>History is obscured in the Starfinder setting, as an unknown amount of time has been mysteriously and completely wiped from everyone's memories and all known records—even those on the Outer Planes. This blank period between ancient and modern history is called the Gap, and while it effects the entire multiverse, the edges aren't all in the same place. For instance, one planet might remember back 300 years, while another remembers back 305—these inconsistencies are the primary references some Starfinders use to piece together the secret history of the universe.</li> 
                <li>There's faster than light travel in Starfinder, via a hyperspace dimension gifted by an ascended AI deity.</li> 
                <li>All the core Pathfinder races will still exist and be playable with the Core Rulebook, yet Starfinder's core races are different, and include humans, lashunta, ysoki (ratfolk), androids, kasatha, and two races not yet revealed.</li> 
                <li>In addition, there's going to be a heavy emphasis on introducing more alien player races. Where possible, you should be able to play the creatures you encounter.</li> 
                <li>There's still plenty of magic in the setting, but technology has become a dominant force. For instance, if you're playing an Iomedaean crusader, you might wear holy powered armor and carry a plasma cannon carved with magical runes.</li> 
                <li>Will continue Pathfinder's legacy of being as diverse and inclusive as possible.</li>
               </ul> 
               <h2>Gameplay</h2> 
               <ul>
                <li>There will be seven core classes on release: the technomancer (magical hacker blending technology and magic), mechanic (engineer with a robot buddy), solarian (mystical melee combatant harnessing the cycles of the stars), soldier (heavy weapons specialist), envoy (diplomat and ally-booster), mystic (caster channeling strange energies to manipulate biological systems), and operative (stealthy skill specialist).</li> 
                <li>Star Wars is a decent comparison, tone-wise, but Starfinder will have more magic and moral ambiguity. Other inspirations include Firefly, Shadowrun, the Expanse series, and more—if we could do for space opera what Shadowrun did for 1980s cyberpunk, we'd be ecstatic.</li> 
                <li>Starfinder puts an even greater focus on exploration than Pathfinder, as the setting pushes many adventurers out toward a galaxy full of uncontacted worlds. While you can play whole adventures or campaigns on a single world if you want, the assumption is that the PCs are probably the crew of a starship.</li> 
                <li>Starship battles will be a significant element in the game, with their own combat system utilizing miniatures, but not as common as ordinary character-scale combat.</li> 
                <li>There will not be an open playtest—instead, there will be a closed playtest will feature other RPG designers and third-party publishers, Pathfinder Society members, and various key members of the industry and community. While we wish we could open the playtest up to everyone, the timeframe involved and scope of the playtest simply make it impractical. (Unlike Pathfinder's class playtests, in order to make this one work, we have to give people the <i>entire</i> game.</li> 
                <li>The plan is to produce a Starfinder Reference Document (like the PRD) and make it available for free online.</li> 
                <li>Starfinder will have an OGL-like compatibility license allowing for third-party products.</li> 
                <li>Starfinder organized play is something we're actively investigating, but not ready to announce anything about just yet.</li>
               </ul> 
               <p>While everyone on the Starfinder team is currently so buried in work that they need snorkels to breathe, we <i>are</i> planning on doing more blog posts and reveals of new information in the coming months, as well as introducing some exciting new ways to preview parts of the game and get feedback from the community at large. So stay tuned!</p>

And finally, we didn't want to reprint much art that we'd since used in hardcover books—a fair amount of the artwork from Curse of the Crimson Throne actually ended up in the <em>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</em>, such as the fight against the giant devilfish (page 185 of the <em>Core Rulebook</em>), the Red Mantis Cinnabar (page 203), or Eva's first design for the Gray Maiden (not only on page 198, but on the back cover of the book).</p>

               <p>The amount of new artwork in the hardcover edition is enormous, with most of the significant NPCs now getting a full body illustration instead of a simple portrait, and with additional half-page illustrations for key encounters and scenes in the story. And it's those new half-page illustrations I'm going to show off today, without context (so as to minimize spoilers) and in some cases illustrating brand new encounters in this version of the Adventure Path. One thing I will say, though, is that each of these illustrations is taken from one of the six parts of the campaign. If you've played Curse of the Crimson Throne before, see if you can guess which illustrations come from what part! And if you've never played Curse of the Crimson Throne, consider these six images as teasers for the perils and excitement that await you!</p>

When presented with such a cool opportunity, the last thing I want to do is mess it up!</p> 
               <p>I've spoken at length about the characters, plot, and origins of <a href="/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics/worldscape">Pathfinder Worldscape</a> with <a href="http://www.bleedingcool.com/2016/08/23/pathfinder-meets-hyboria-barsoom-golarion-and-more" target="_blank">Bleeding Cool</a>, <a href="http://knowdirectionpodcast.com/2016/09/know-direction-140-erik-mona-tells-us-whats-up-with-2017-audio/" target="_blank">Know Direction</a>, and <a href="http://blog.tfaw.com/2016/09/22/pathfinder-worldscape-fantasy-characters/" target="_blank">Things from Another World</a>, but every Wednesday from now until the end of the series, I plan to peel back the skin of the RPG side of <a href="/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics/worldscape">Pathfinder Worldscape</a> right here on the Paizo Blog, in a new series I'm calling Worldscape Workbook.</p> 
               <p>How did I choose which characters to adapt? Why did I make this or that decision about how to bring their weird powers, equipment, or racial abilities into the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game? I'll be letting you know right here every week with a look into my thought process, as wrong-headed as that may sometimes prove to be.</p> 
               <p>I'm thrilled to be able to bring so many amazing characters from the sword &amp; sorcery, pulp, and comics tradition to Pathfinder, and the resulting discussions around the Paizo editorial office were interesting enough that I thought you would appreciate a fly-on-the-wall look at how it's all gone down so far.</p> 
               <p><a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lj46">Last week</a>, I kicked off the Worldscape Workbook with a look at Red Sonja's (in)famous "chainmail bikini," and how I jumped through several hoops and ran into some development dead-ends trying to figure out how to make it work in Pathfinder. In the end, I decided Sonja's skimpy armor wasn't armor at all, and resolved to use a special archetype to give her the Armor Class oomph necessary to go toe-to-toe with some of the nastiest customers of the Hyborian Age.</p> 
               <p>But as archetypes modify specific Pathfinder RPG class abilities, before I could get to the details of Red Sonja's archetype, I knew I had an even more important question to answer: What is Red Sonja's class?</p> 
               <p>The easy, almost reflexive answer, is that Red Sonja is a barbarian. Her past as the daughter of a chieftain in the Hyrkanian Steppes is more barbaric than cosmopolitan, to be sure, but (as with most things), the "simple" solution really isn't the best, and isn't very true to her character as presented in the comic books.</p> 
               <p>Which, actually, brings up a fair point. Red Sonja first appeared in a 1973 Conan the Barbarian comic written by Roy Thomas and illustrated by Barry Windsor Smith. A natural female foil for the hard-headed Conan, comic book Sonja drew inspiration from Conan creator Robert E. Howard's Red Sonya (note the "Y"), a swashbuckler historical adventure character from the 1934 story "Shadow of the Vulture." In the more than 40 years since that original comic appearance, Sonja has had scores of writers and artists, all of whom brought their own approach to the character. Like many multi-decade comics heroes, there are a lot of "takes" on Sonja's origin, personality, and skill set.</p> 
               <p>To prepare for <a href="/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics/worldscape">Pathfinder Worldscape</a>, I read about 100 Red Sonja comics, ranging from her original 1970s adventures (published by Marvel) to the most recent issues of her current series from our partners at Dynamite. For key character details, I focused most strongly on writer Gail Simone and artist Walter Giovani's landmark 18-issue run that kicked off with the re-imagined origin of Red Sonja in the <a href="http://www.dynamite.com/htmlfiles/viewProduct.html?PRO=C1606904817" target="_blank">Queen of Plagues</a> story arc from 2013. While keeping the most important elements of Sonja's origin and character intact, Simone's revamp gave Red Sonja more agency even before the tragedy that put her on the path of the warrior. Gone was the empowering goddess Scathach, the 1970s source of Red Sonja's fighting prowess. Gone was her ridiculous vow of chastity to only bed men who had bested her in combat. And gone, too, were other depressing elements of sexual violence to Sonja's origin story that probably seemed appropriate to a male comics writer in the early 70s, but which are grating and deeply un-empowering by modern standards.</p> 
               <p>For me, the Simone reboot keeps or amplifies everything that makes Red Sonja a compelling character while jettisoning the lamer elements of the original origin, creating a hero who cut her way to greatness under her own power as opposed to a puppet of a mostly absent chastity-obsessed war goddess. Opinions probably differ, but I considered it a vast improvement. I therefore turned mostly to the 2013 arc for issues related to Red Sonja's early life, which of course plays directly into decisions about her official Pathfinder class.</p> 
               <p>As I read through my huge pile of Red Sonja comics, it became very clear to me that Red Sonja was not a barbarian at all, at least by the standards of the Pathfinder rules. For starters, while Red Sonja certainly displays anger and combat prowess throughout her adventures, she doesn't "rage" in the traditional Pathfinder sense. Her anger and fury doesn't translate into short bursts of greater power. In fact, over the course of her adventures, "Strength" isn't really emphasized at all. During a recent Conan/Red Sonja crossover, Red Sonja's speed and, in game terms, Dexterity, were emphasized in direct contrast to Conan's Cimmerian brawn. Comic book Conan may, in fact, be a barbarian, but it's simply not a good fit for Red Sonja.</p> 
               <p>Ok, then, maybe she's something funky and off-beat like the <a href="/products/btpy978v"><em>Advanced Class Guide's</em></a> brawler, or even a swashbuckler? Well, maybe, but for major heroes like Red Sonja and John Carter, I wanted to use one of the Pathfinder game's core base classes to start with, because I imagine these comics will be drawing in people who are roughly familiar with the primary Pathfinder game rules, but maybe not with our secondary or tertiary class books. So I decided to close that particular door before delving too deeply into it myself.</p> 
               <p>What about a fighter? Red Sonja is undoubtedly known for combat prowess, swordcraft, and bow skill. In Pathfinder terms, she's definitely in the d10 Hit Die camp, with the resulting "best" Base Attack Bonus progression that goes with it. Fighter certainly qualified on that front. The class would also load up Sonja with a bunch of cool combat feats, which would make her an even more formidable opponent—a design goal I definitely did not want to overlook.</p> 
               <p>All that said, fighter provided one major challenge, above and beyond the fact that Armor Training is one of the fighter's most important class features, and I'd already decided that Red Sonja basically didn't wear armor. I could always use Sonja's archetype to "swap out" Armor Training for something that gave her an Armor Class bonus when not wearing armor, but when you take away the fighter's Armor Training and Armor Mastery, there isn't an awful lot of other goodies left over to trade out for other archetype powers. And, after reading 100 Red Sonja comics, I knew I had some other powers I wanted to give her.</p> 
               <p>That led me to consider a solution that, when originally posted to my Facebook fan page before my reading spree, didn't seem to make a whole lot of sense. What about the ranger?</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderComics/20160928-Tracking.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderComics/20160928-Tracking_500.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>A close look at Red Sonja's origin story suggested that the idea had a lot of merit. To recap, Red Sonja was the daughter of a chieftain of the Hyrkanian Steppes, a huge land in the east of Robert E. Howard's Hyborian Age. When she was 12, marauders sacked her village and murdered the rest of the family, making vengeance a huge part of Sonja's motivation from almost the very beginning. Almost. Consider this interaction between Sonja and her father, shortly before the raiders arrive, when the family is out on a hunt.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderComics/20160928-BestHunter.jpg">
               </div> 
               <p>So, by the age of 12, Red Sonja is "better with a bow than anyone in our village," and she knows "every bit of woodlore we can teach." Her father further adds, "No one can shoot or track better." That's compelling evidence and probably enough to make the case alone, but there's more.</p> 
               <p>Throughout the series, Sonja' enemies call her "Sonja the Hunter," an appellation she mentions herself, as well. In Simone's second story arc, <a href=" http://www.dynamite.com/htmlfiles/viewProduct.html?PRO=C1606905295" target="blank">The Art of Blood and Fire</a>, a southern potentate named Emperor Samala hires "Sonja the Hunter" to track down the world's six greatest artisans for a party commemorating his imminent death and entombment. "I need a tracker," he says on the following page.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderComics/20160928-EmperorSamala.jpg">
               </div> 
               <p>Want more proof? Here's Red Sonja tracking a group of fish-men through a watery swamp. Note also that Sonja uses a shortbow in this scene, which she does commonly throughout the series—further proof that I needed to figure out a way to work her ranged combat expertise into her overall rules presentation.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderComics/20160928-Upwind.jpg">
               </div> 
               <p>Lastly, Red Sonja shows strong animal affinity throughout her many appearances, and seems to especially despise cruelty to animals. In the aforementioned Conan/Red Sonja crossover (published by current Conan publisher Dark Horse under arrangement with Dynamite and co-written by Simone and former Pathfinder comics writer Jim Zub), Red Sonja encounters a cruel animal trainer named Kalayah, who later appears as one of Emperor Samala's "greatest artisans in the world," much to Sonja's ire. Check out the way she talks about Kalayah's horrible treatment of his performing animals.</p>

               <p>Spoiler alert: It doesn't end well for Kalayah.</p> 
               <p>So that's several signifiers that point in the direction of a ranger: Excellent bow skills, total mastery of woodlore, respect and affinity for animals, tracking ability so strong her reputation as a hunter spreads to the leaders of distant foreign nations. And one more thing so common I didn't even bother looking for images to prove it to you—Red Sonja constantly fights with two weapons, another hallmark of the Pathfinder ranger.</p> 
               <p>Of course, the Pathfinder RPG ranger has a lot of class features that aren't appropriate for Red Sonja. She doesn't have an animal companion. She doesn't seem to favor a particular type of enemy over any other. She doesn't have what Pathfinder calls "favored terrain." And, perhaps most importantly, she doesn't cast spells.</p> 
               <p>While those inappropriate class features look like they disqualify the ranger from contention, in fact I was thrilled to have them. Staying competitive without wearing armor is a pretty major power, and I had other elements—such as Red Sonja's "Curse of Hyrkania" death vow—that were also going to be necessary to keep her competitive with other d10 Hit Die warrior types.</p> 
               <p>Making those powers work would mean swapping out significant, powerful, and frequently useful class features—exactly the type of "inappropriate" class features provided by the ranger.</p> 
               <p>To me, that looked an awful lot like a solution.</p> 
               <p>Red Sonja is a ranger.</p> 
               <p>She's not just a ranger, though. She's a ranger with the very special "sword-devil" archetype, which I'll begin to go into in next week's installment of the Worldscape Workbook!</p> 
               <p>Until then, please consider setting up a <a href="/products/btpy8tvw">Pathfinder Comics Ongoing Subscription</a>, which will ensure that you don't miss a single issue. If subscribing direct from Paizo isn't your thing, be sure to ask your local comic or game store to order you a copy of <a href="/products/btpy9oco"><em>Pathfinder Worldscape #1</em></a>, which releases on Wednesday, October 19th!</p> 
               <p>And now, if you'll excuse me, I have a green Martian named Tars Tarkas who desperately needs game statistics!</p>

               <p>The wind howled in protest as the traveler strode out alone into the storm, heeding only the call of her own desires. The dust threatened to steal her breath, but she grasped at the cowl of her cape to protect her face.</p>

By breathe, of course, I mean we kept busy with sanctioning a big pile of modules and Adventure Paths (many of which we're queuing for a big release next month); outline and assign a big chunk of Season 8's adventures; and perform some long-range planning that takes us through 2017 and beyond. When it came time to start developing September's adventures, it had been so long since we'd done any scenario development that the process seemed strangely alien.</p>

               <p itemprop="description">Once Gen Con ended in August, Linda and I had a chance to breathe after pushing ourselves to create an immense number of adventures for the <a href="/pathfinderSociety">Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild</a>. By breathe, of course, I mean we kept busy with sanctioning a big pile of modules and Adventure Paths (many of which we're queuing for a big release next month); outline and assign a big chunk of Season 8's adventures; and perform some long-range planning that takes us through 2017 and beyond. When it came time to start developing September's adventures, it had been so long since we'd done any scenario development that the process seemed strangely alien.</p> 
               <p>Thankfully, that coincides nicely with these adventures, both of which deal with very alien people, places, and things.</p> 
               <p>For the first of these adventures, Isabelle Lee takes us back to Numeria for the first time since Season 6 with <a href="/products/btpy9oih"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-04: Wardens of Sulfur Gulch</em></a>. Pathfinders recently uncovered hitherto unknown surveys of the Numerian landscape by the famous Gojan the Sharp, and Venture-Captain Holgarin Smine believes one of these sites in particular merits exploration. To reach the ruins, the PCs must first impress the Kellid tribe (including one of its mystics, pictured here) that claims the region as its own—and that's even before the Pathfinders can uncover the dangerous legacy that lies within Sulfur Gulch! Whether you love technological adventures or seek the camaraderie of robot-hating peers, this Tier 7-11 adventure has something for everyone.</p> 
               <div class="blurb90">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PZOPSS0805E-Faiza.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PZOPSS0805E-Faiza_90.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <i>Illustration by Marko Horvatin</i>
               </div> 
               <p>When we first announced <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5liu5">Season 8: Year of the Stolen Storm</a>, we mentioned this year would enjoy a considerable connection to the elemental planes. Now that we've kicked off the season properly, we're taking our first jaunt to the Plane of Earth with Jenny Jarzabski as the pilot in <a href="/products/btpy9oii"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-05: Ungrounded But Unbroken</em></a>. The shaitan genies of the Opaline Vault aren't as easy to impress with words as they are with actions, and the best way to demonstrate the Society's worth is by working directly for one of the shaitans' finest: the genie Faiza, pictured here. This Tier 1-5 adventure with Sovereign Court connections allows even novice adventurers to play a big role on another plane, with challenges that take them to strange urban sites and bizarre wilderness realms.</p> 
               <p>As a closing note, as the Pathfinder Society team spins up the Pathfinder Society scenario subscription, we're encountering some new, very necessary logistical steps. We've already taken steps to ensure our production schedule accommodates these going forward, but we're unable to compress our timeline further for the September scenarios to account for those challenges. Regretfully, that means that the September scenarios are delayed by one week (now debuting October 5, 2016). We're sorry for the inconvenience, and future months' publications should be back on schedule.</p>

              <div itemprop="articlebody"> 
               <p itemprop="description">Today is special—two blogs on one day! Lots of PFS goodness! First up, a new program aimed at rewarding purchases made at Friendly, Local Game Stores or other retail establishments that offer Pathfinder Society space for games. This has been in the works for some time and I am exited to reveal it to our playerbase!</p> 
               <p>Later today, John Compton introduces the newest Pathfinder Society scenarios—<a href="/products/btpy9oih"><em>#8-04 Wardens of Sulfer Gulch</em></a> and <a href="/products/btpy9oii"><em>#8-05 Ungrounded But Unbroken</em></a>.</p> 
               <p>Without further ado...</p> 
               <h2>Retail Incentive Program</h2> 
               <p>Back in March, at GAMA Trade Show, Erik and I announced a program for retailers that would encourage players to purchase items from their stores. Since then, the PFS team drafted ideas, solicited feedback from stores and VOs, made revisions, and are now ready to try the program. We may need to tweak it from here, but we want to give it some time in the field before we start making changes. Once launched, if you have feedback, post it as a comment or email it to <a href="mailto:pathfindersociety@paizo.com">pathfindersociety@paizo.com</a>.</p> 
               <p>Right now, the program is focused on the <em>Roleplaying Guild Guide</em>. To those playing Adventure Card Guild—don't despair. We haven't forgotten you! I just didn't want to hold the program while we explored options for card scenarios.</p> 
               <p>In writing the program, we observed that not all PFS games are held in FLGS space. Sometimes they are in community halls or sporting halls that also house a refreshment stand or other sales outlet. Thus we named it retail, not retailer, and offer it as a tool for any location with a retail outlet patronized by Pathfinder Society players.</p> 
               <p>We realize that demographics are different and each retail location should decide what is best for their business, thus participation in the retail incentive program is <b>not</b> mandatory. Locations utilizing the program should advertise its presence to their clientele.</p> 
               <p>For countries outside the US, an approximate equivalent of local currency is used. For example, $10 USD = 7. 67 British Pound or 13.27 Australian Dollars or 8.96 Euro, so round to the closest .25 and use that figure. This doesn't mean you have to look up the exchange rate each game day, just use the general exchange rate.</p> 
               <p>Please note, the benefits gained from the retail purchase program stack with benefits a player receives from the reroll program. </p>
               <h3>The Details</h3> 
               <p>This proposal grants a benefit to the entire table, scaling depending on how much money someone spent.</p> 
               <p>Game stores and other retail locations are an important part of the Pathfinder Society community, and it's important to support them so that there's always a public venue for organized play events. Players can now redeem receipts in exchange for a modest benefit shared by the entire table—all as a way of thanking players for supporting their game stores.</p> 
               <p>Redeeming a receipt simply involves showing it to the GM, who marks the receipt to denote that it was used. A player can only use a receipt in this way on the same day as she made the purchase, and only for events held at that venue. A player can acquire and redeem a receipt during play so long as doing so would not significantly disrupt gameplay, though it must occur before an encounter begins. The receipt need not be for Paizo products; the storeowner may include any products the venue sells as qualifying purchases.</p> 
               <p>At any time during an event, players may redeem receipts from their purchases worth $10 or more to gain a single-use benefit that applies to all of the PCs at the table. If the total combined receipts provided by one or more players are $50 or more, all players receive an enhanced benefit. No matter how many receipts the players have, the table can never use the same benefit more than once during a game session; they can, however, gain both benefits during a session.</p> 
               <p>All of the PCs gain the following benefit:</p> 
               <ul>
                <li><i>Harder to Kill:</i> Treat the character's Constitution as 5 points higher than normal for the purpose of determining when hit point damage would kill him. For the enhanced benefit, treat the character's Constitution as 10 higher.</li>
               </ul> 
               <p>Each player may also choose to use one of the following during the game:</p> 
               <ul>
                <li><i>Cheaper Healing:</i> Before the end of the session, you can use the benefit to reduce the Prestige Point cost of one spellcasting service of the healing subschool by 1 (minimum 0). For the enhanced benefit, you can instead reduce the cost by 2.</li> 
                <li><i>Recover from Wounds:</i> The PC recovers hit points equal to twice their character level. For the enhanced benefit, each PC also recovers 2 points of ability damage to one ability score. This benefit can only be used outside of combat.</li> 
                <li><i>Bonus Wealth:</i> If you do not use the subsidized healing benefit above, you can instead choose to roll twice and take the higher result when rolling a Day Job check. For the enhanced benefit, you also increase the gold you earn from the day Job result by 50% (maximum 300 gp total).</li>
               </ul> 
               <p>So there you have it—the Retail Incentive Program. We will update the <a href="/pathfinderSociety/policies">policy section of the website</a> as soon as possible and the policy will appear in the next version of the <em>Roleplaying Guild Guide</em>. As this is a new program, we appreciate constructive feedback. Remember to post it here or send it to <a href="mailto:pathfindersociety@paizo.com">pathfindersociety@paizo.com</a>.</p> 
               <p>Don't forget to check back later for John's blog!</p> 
               <p>Until next week: Explore, Report, Cooperate!</p>

               </div> 
               <p>Everybody loves a good Unicorn, and I think WizKids has done a great job with this one. Use it to represent a paladin's mount, a fun forest encounter, or as a captive in need of rescue. It's a Unicorn. The Unicorn is a Large, uncommon figure.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160923-Cage.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160923-Cage_180.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Speaking of captives, why not use this Cage to imprison your player characters? With a lid that removes from the flat base, you actually can fit miniatures inside this simple metal Cage for an encounter they won't soon forget. As dungeon dressing, the Cage will appear about once per case, in place of an Uncommon figure.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160923-Candelabra.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160923-Candelabra_180.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Speaking of cool dungeon dressing, check out this spooky Candelabra! The Candelabra is also randomly inserted, about one per case.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160923-Hellgate.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160923-Hellgate_360.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>There are a lot of devils and devil-aligned critters in <a href="/products/btpy9kcu"><em>Deadly Foes</em></a>, and they've got to have come from somewhere. Watch your players eyes go wide with fear when you place the Hellgate upon the table. The gate probably leads to the home plane of devils, but you can really use it for just about any kind of evil-aligned magical portal. Your secret is safe with me. I (probably) won't tell Asmodeus. Again, as a bit of dungeon dressing, the Hellgate should appear once per case.</p> 
               <p>And that's it for this week's short-and-sweet preview. We'll see you next week, for what I believe will be the final four figures of the set!</p> 
               <p>Until then, I remain...</p>

I'm quite excited about the series as a Pathfinder publisher and as a pulp fan, but to be perfectly frank, the thing that excites me most about <a href="/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics/worldscape">Pathfinder Worldscape</a> is the fact that I am writing it.</p> 
               <p>I've previously contributed scripts to the <a href="/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics/goblins"><em>Pathfinder: Goblins!</em></a>, <a href="/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics/origins"><em>Pathfinder: Origins</em></a>, and <a href="/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics/hollowMountain"><em>Pathfinder: Hollow Mountain</em></a> series, but this is my first go as the sole writer for all six issues, and overall the Worldscape project is one I've been working behind the scenes to make happen for years, almost since the very first Pathfinder comic ever came out. I'm thrilled and humbled by the opportunity to write comics featuring the iconic characters we created, but mixing that with the chance to script the exploits of characters created by Robert E. Howard (and Roy Thomas), Edgar Rice Burroughs, and Frank Frazetta pushes the experience over the top for me to the point that it's become a real creative highlight of my career.</p> 
               <p><a href="/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics/worldscape"><em>Pathfinder Worldscape</em></a> also provides me with the opportunity to work up official Pathfinder RPG game statistics for some of these legendary heroes. As with previous <a href="/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics">Pathfinder comics</a> series, each issue of Worldscape contains a short RPG appendix and a pull-out miniatures-scale poster map. The first issue naturally leads with official game statistics for Red Sonja, one of Dynamite's flagship characters and one of the true pillars of sword &amp; sorcery comics. Putting together Red Sonja's Pathfinder stats was a fascinating experience in game design and creative adaptation, and in the process of making it all work it occurred to me that it might be fun to open up my creative process a bit here on the Paizo blog, and discuss—step by step—my thought process on bringing these characters to life—Pathfinder style.</p> 
               <p>So, welcome to the first installment of the Worldscape Workbook, where I plan to do just that, on a more or less weekly basis. Throughout the month leading up to the Worldscape series and during the release of the issues themselves, I'll be opening up my brain here every Wednesday (because Wednesday is new comic book day!) and letting you know what went into adapting these characters, and why I made some of the decisions I did.</p> 
               <p>Even though I'm taking the design lead on this project, of course there are lots of other people involved, giving me suggestions, modifying my mistakes, and generally snickering about my bad decisions directly to my face in advance, ideally to spare me from all of you laughing in my face after the issue comes out, and it is too late to do anything about it. These conversations have taught me a lot about the design philosophy at play within Paizo's editorial and design department, and as I was sitting there thinking about how interesting it was to sink my teeth into this stuff, it occurred to me that a lot of you would probably find it pretty interesting, too.</p> 
               <p>I won't be posting the game statistics here on the blog—you've got to <a href="/products/btpy9oco">buy the issue</a> for that—but I do plan to talk about why I made certain decisions, and (sometimes just as importantly) why I didn't make certain other design decisions (or why I did, and Jason Bulmahn made me change it). In the process I'll be revealing some of my own design blind spots and stupidities, which I figure some of you will also appreciate.</p> 
               <p>So let's begin at the beginning, with the character featured in next month's <a href="/products/btpy9oco"><em>Pathfinder Worldscape #1</em></a>: RED SONJA!</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderComics/20160921-Worldscape1.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderComics/20160921-Worldscape1_180.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>In the following weeks, I'll discuss things like Red Sonja's statistics, her new sword-devil archetype, her class, her equipment load-out, and so on, but first things first. I've got to address the chainmail bikini.</p> 
               <p>It goes without saying that there is not currently a bikini armor type in the Pathfinder RPG, so figuring out the value of Red Sonja's armor wasn't as simple as simply picking out something appropriate from the <a href="/products/btpy88y"><em>Core Rulebook</em></a>. The smallest bit of armor there that's even remotely close is the chain shirt, and while the original version of Red Sonja way back in the 1970s DID wear a chain shirt (along with some fantastic hotpants), the current incarnation wears decidedly less material.</p> 
               <p>As an aside, one of my biggest surprises in researching about 100 issues of Red Sonja comics from various eras is that her chainmail bikini isn't really chainmail.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderComics/20160921-Worldscape2.jpg"><img src="//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderComics/20160921-Worldscape2_180.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>That's more appropriately a type of armor called "coin mail," which also isn't in the <a href="/products/btpy88y"><em>Core Rulebook</em></a>, in bikini form or otherwise. So my first decision regarding Red Sonja's armor was that I was going to have to invent an entirely new type of armor for her, which I did:</p> 
               <blockquote> 
                <p class="stat-block-title">New Armor Type: Decorative Armor</p> 
                <p class="stat-block">Little more than a few small patches of cloth adorned with bits of metal, decorative armor is more a fashion statement than practical protection. Despite its impracticality, decorative armor can be enchanted with enhancement bonuses and special armor qualities.</p> 
                <p class="stat-block-1"><b>Cost</b> 5 gp; <b>Armor Bonus</b> +0; <b>Maximum Dex Bonus</b> —; <b>Armor Check Penalty</b> 0; <b>Arcane Spell Failure</b> 5%; <b>Speed (30 ft.)</b> 30ft.; <b>Speed (20 ft.)</b> 20 ft.; <b>Weight</b> 5 lbs.</p> 
               </blockquote> 
               <p>This passed muster with a couple of Paizo's developers, but "decorative armor" met its match when I passed it by Jason Bulmahn and Owen K.C. Stephens, who correctly pointed out that I had created it only as a kludge to get Red Sonja enhancement bonuses, and that this type of armor would be too tempting to monks and wizards, who would gain all of the upside while suffering none of the downside. Jason did thank me for at least putting that 5% spell failure chance in there, but I'd only done that as a trick to sneak it by him, and it didn't work.</p> 
               <p>So decorative armor was dead, as I pretty much knew it would be, and I had to figure out something else. To be honest, I wasn't too bothered, as the solution never really worked for me, anyway. Slapping three triangles of a dozen silver pieces over your breasts and crotch doesn't really make for effective protection of any kind, so facing rejection of my armor solution, I went back to my original original idea, which is far, far simpler.</p> 
               <p>Red Sonja's chainmail bikini isn't armor at all.</p> 
               <p>Instead, I decided, Red Sonja would derive most of her Armor Class from a combination of a naturally high Dexterity AND a special ability of her sword-devil archetype.</p> 
               <p>But an archetype requires a class, and what class is Red Sonja? Check back here next week, and I'll tell you!</p> 
               <p>In the meantime, check out a recent interview I did with <a href="http://www.bleedingcool.com/2016/08/23/pathfinder-meets-hyboria-barsoom-golarion-and-more" target="_blank">Bleeding Cool</a> about the series with lots of details on the plot, characters, and how the whole project came together.</p> 
               <p>You might also consider setting up a <a href="/products/btpy8tvw">Pathfinder Comics Ongoing Subscription</a> to make sure you don't miss the first issue, which hits comic stands on October 19th!</p> 
               <p>Thanks for your time, and we'll see you in next week's Worldscape Workbook!</p>

                <a href="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6819-OlochFront.jpg"><img src="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6819-OlochFront_360.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6819-OlochBack.jpg"><img src="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6819-OlochBack_360.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <i>"...relishing the red rush of battle..."</i>
               </div> 
               <p>This Oloch shows a personal take on the minor blessing power, but if you need aid in a fight, he can contribute some divine aid—or just charge into the fray himself. During playtesting, our phrase for this Oloch was "Gorum helps those who beat the crap out of things."</p> 
               <p>Next up is the forgepriest Amli Faldar. We found Amli in the Pathfinder Campaign Setting book <a href="/products/btpy9aue"><em>Belkzen, Hold of the Orc Hordes</em></a>. Amli is a follower of Kols the Oath-Keeper, the dwarven demigod of duty.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6819-AmliFront.jpg"><img src="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6819-AmliFront_360.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6819-AmliBack.jpg"><img src="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6819-AmliBack_360.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <i>The hammer is also named Oathkeeper.</i>
               </div> 
               <p>As a member of the Oathkeepers, Amli adds dwarven toughness and Craft to Melee and Divine skills. She's good at using both weapons and armor, and she can help others who do so as well.</p> 
               <p>Finally we see Uliah Muharim, a charismatic member of the Wagons of Light, a group secretly working to combat the undead. We found Uliah in the Pathfinder Player Companion book <a href="/products/btpy9h7x"><em>Black Markets</em></a>. Like many in the Wagons of Light, Uliah is a devotee of Sarenrae, the Everlight.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6819-UliahFront.jpg"><img src="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6819-UliahFront_360.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6819-UliahBack.jpg"><img src="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6819-UliahBack_360.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <i>Shown here NOT in disguise...</i>
               </div> 
               <p>Uliah is our most divine-focused warpriest character, and is also the best with allies, especially mounts. Our hope with Uliah is that you will enjoy having him charge around from location to location, and so will everyone else in your party.</p> 
               <p>For this class deck, we're trying a few new things. We've added some boons for each character's deity. For Gorum, we added a series of spiked armor cards, reflecting the favor of Our Lord in Iron. For Kols Son of Torag, we added a series of hammers, weapons that aid in crafting. For Sarenrae, we added a variety of healing and anti-undead powers, and also a theme built around mount allies.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6819-SpikedBreastplate.jpg"><img src="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6819-SpikedBreastplate_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6819-GolembaneHammer2.jpg"><img src="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6819-GolembaneHammer2_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6819-Hallow.jpg"><img src="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6819-Hallow_180.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <i>Look at all the holy candles...</i>
               </div> 
               <p>Another new concept in this class deck has to do with deities' favored weapons and a new concept for cards list powers. The idea came from various attempts to make the favored weapons available to the characters even though they aren't—and shouldn't be—Basic cards. On the cards list side of each character card, in the area where a cohort might be listed, we have a new instruction. For example, Amli's is <i>You may treat 1 copy of the weapon Warhammer as if it says "Owner: Amli."</i> This is somewhat like a character power, but it applies only during deckbuilding and rebuilding. Using this technique, we can give Oloch a Greatsword, Amli a Warhammer, and Uliah a Scimitar.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6819-Greatsword.jpg"><img src="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6819-Greatsword_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6819-Warhammer.jpg"><img src="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6819-Warhammer_180.jpeg"></a> <a href="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6819-Scimitar.jpg"><img src="//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6819-Scimitar_180.jpeg"></a>
                <br> <i>A trio of starting weapons—in the right hands.</i>
               </div> 
               <p>We might adopt this concept to other uses in the future. For game designers, this is interesting new space, a way to smooth over some rough edges and also add some fun new knobs and levers, without adding more powers to an already crowded powers list. One thing that's key to this idea is that it's "fire and forget"—you use it when you need to see the cards list, but you <i>don't</i> need to look at it when you're playing a scenario. Please try this out and let us know what you think!</p> 
               <p>One final note. Those PACG players who like to dig into the background of these characters might recognize some names from the Pathfinder resources mentioned here. When we were looking for existing warpriests to inspire the class deck characters, we found several potential examples. When we discovered that both Ron Lundeen and Tyler Beck had (independently) worked on some, we knew we'd found our characters. Special thanks to both Ron and Tyler for inspiring the characters and for playtesting and feedback on these (and many, many other) parts of the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game—and thanks again to all of our amazing fans, playtesters, players, and contributors!</p>

               <p>Last fall, I wrote a feature blog on SkålCon, a new convention in Minneapolis-St. Paul organized by Venture-Captains Andrew Christian &amp; Jon Dehning and their motley crew of stalwart Pathfinder Society folk. This past weekend saw the return of SkålCon, bigger and badder than ever. Once again, the team set out to raise money for charity as part of the show, this time sacrificing Venture-Lieutenant Keith Apperson's locks to the cause. I received an email from Jon that SkålCon attendees opened their hearts and gave generously, surpassing last year's total by Friday. Thanks to all who contributed—the convention raised $6,003 for Tubman Charities.</p> 
               <p>One of our international events this upcoming weekend is PaizoCon Oz in Canberra, Australia. Venture-Captain Steve Coling is the lead organizer. Activities include both Adventure Card Guild adventures and Roleplaying Guild scenarios, including <a href="/products/btpy9mbd"><em>#7-99 Through Maelstrom Rift</em></a>, and <a href="/products/btpy9mbe"><em>#8-00 The Cosmic Captive</em></a>. The event also features some fundraising activities for the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. Looks like it is shaping up to be a great event. Reports are that there still may be room, so check out the <a href="https://m.facebook.com/pfsaustralia/" target="_blank">Pathfinder Society Australia Facebook page</a> for more information.</p> 
               <p>Announcement time! PaizoCon Oz 2017 is traveling to New Zealand. As part of the move, the convention made some special arrangements with Hobbiton, of "Lord of the Rings" fame. Attendance fee includes a tour of the Hobbiton village/film set, as well as the opportunity to play an interactive special event in the Green Dragon Inn! Due to the location and special events, attendee space at PaizoCon Oz is limited. Once PaizoCon Oz 2016 is over, the team will start posting information for next year's event on their Facebook page (link above).</p> 
               <p>Related to conventions is the question of our special event content and when/where an item can be ran. Here is the master list event organizers are using to determine what events to schedule. Events are broken out by the requirements needed to run each item. If an item is limited to a specific group of GMs, then it won't be available for purchase in our webstore, but may be granted to GMs as part of the convention support process.</p> 
               <blockquote> 
                <h2>Current Scenario Rules as of September 20, 2016</h2> 
                <p>These scenarios may be run by any 4-star or 5-star GM or a Venture-Officer at any time. They also may be run by anybody at a convention. Any convention may schedule Bonekeep, as there are no table minimums.</p> 
                <ul>
                 <li><em>Bonekeep Level 1: The Silent Grave</em> (Levels 3-7)</li>

                 <li><em>Bonekeep Level 3: The Wakening Tomb</em> (Levels 5-9)</li>
                </ul> 
                <p>These scenarios may be run anywhere, but only by 4-star and 5-star GMs (and ONLY them—Venture-Officers may only run them if they meet this requirement. VCs get a +2 and VLs a +1 to their star rating to meet this requirement).</p> 
                <ul>
                 <li><em>#6-98: Serpent's Rise</em> (Levels 7 Special Pregens Only)</li>

                </ul> 
                <p>This scenario may be run at Tier 4 and above conventions (26+ tables of PFS in a 3-day period) by 4-star and 5-star GMs (and ONLY them—Venture-Officers may only run it if they meet this requirement. VCs get a +2 and VLs a +1 to their star rating to meet this requirement).</p> 
                <ul>
                 <li><em>#7-99: Through Maelstrom Rift</em> (Level 6 Special Pregens Only)</li>
                </ul> 
                <p>This scenario may be run anywhere but only by 5-star GMs (and ONLY them...Venture-Officers may only run it if they meet this requirement. VCs get a +2 and VLs a +1 to their star rating to meet this requirement).</p>

                </ul> 
                <p>These scenarios may be run anywhere if they meet the listed table minimum, are playing the scenario simultaneously, and are in contact with each other.*</p>

                <p>These scenarios may be run at conventions if there are 6 or more tables playing the RPG scenario simultaneously and in contact with each other. To make sure areas are not over-saturated, RVC approval must be received. To run the ACG component, an event must have at least 2 tables with 2 players each:</p>

This time around, there's an even wider range of player options to choose from—sure, there are plenty of spells for your spellcasters to explore, but there's also new archetypes, additional traits, all sorts of new feats, a new category of subdomian, divine fighting styles, and much, much more!</p> 
               <p>But don't just take my word for it. Check out some of the great art in the book that goes along with all this new content!</p>

               <p>First up this week is the Sewer Beast, a beloved (and re-named) creature from the very first <a href="/products/btpy8auu"><em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</em></a>! This popular denizen of dungeons and sewers alike makes his <a href="/pathfinderbattles">Pathfinder Battles</a> debut with art inspired by Wayne Reynolds's cover of <a href="/products/btpy81xw"><em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #7: Edge of Anarchy</em></a>, which we're reprinting next month as part of the incredible <a href="/products/btpy9nme/">Curse of the Crimson Throne Adventure Path hardcover</a>. Those of you playing that epic campaign will find this a most helpful miniature indeed, as will anyone whose adventures routinely take them to the smellier part of a city's infrastructure. My favorite part of this figure are the eyestalks, complete with their very own tampo'd eyes. Spooky! The Sewer Beast is a Large, uncommon figure.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160916-Keketar.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160916-keketar_360.jpeg"></a>

               <p>Gamers have been asking for proteans in <a href="/pathfinderbattles">Pathfinder Battles</a> for ages, and I'm happy to report that <a href="/products/btpy9kcu"><em>Deadly Foes</em></a> gives us our first opportunity to answer those prayers directly, and in the best possible way! Again using classic Wayne Reynolds Pathfinder art as inspiration (this time the cover of <a href="/products/btpy87uz"><em>The Great Beyond</em></a>), WizKids's talented digital artists have brought this creature—completely original to Pathfinder—to three glorious dimensions. I'm thrilled with the complex color guide (seven different colors on this one!), and overall the final figure is just delightful to drop on the table. There will definitely be more proteans to come, but we had to begin with the one that started it all! The Keketar Protean is a Large, rare figure.</p>

                <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160916-ArcanePillar.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160916-ArcanePillar_360.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Just last week, in the FANTASTIC and VERY HELPFUL thread of minis suggestions that accompanied the weekly preview blog (we're seriously stealing at least a dozen figure ideas from that thread), at least one poster mentioned the need for regular old pillars as dungeon dressing in a future <a href="/pathfinderbattles">Pathfinder Battles</a> set. While I'm not sure the glowing runes on this Arcane Pillar count as a "regular" pillar (you'll have to wait for the NEXT set for that!), I can deliver a pillar of some kind much sooner than many of you probably anticipated. With glowing runes along one side, the Arcane Pillar makes a versatile piece that can be used in just about any dungeon encounter. I like the idea of running a gauntlet of three sets of these, in which crossing the plane of the inward-facing runes causes some kind of horrific magical effect. Fun! The Arcane Pillar is a randomly inserted dungeon dressing piece that takes the place of an uncommon figure. While collation is never guaranteed, the idea is that each case should include at least one of them.</p> 
               <p>And that's it for this week, leaving us two more four-figure previews for <a href="/products/btpy9kcu"><em>Deadly Foes</em></a> in the weeks to come.</p> 
               <p>Feel free to keep posting figure suggestions to the comments. Mike and I read them assiduously and will definitely consider them for the setlist we're currently building.</p> 
               <p>Thanks again for your interest in and support of the <a href="/pathfinderbattles">Pathfinder Battles</a>. It's a labor of love for everyone involved, and your support makes it possible.</p> 
               <p>See you next week!</p>

               <p>The trouble is that by divesting our metaplot from the Adventure Paths, we'd entered fairly undocumented territory. <a href="/products/btpy87uz"><em>The Great Beyond</em></a> provides valuable information upon which <a href="/products/btpy978p"><em>Blood of the Elements</em></a> built, but we had still written fewer words about these nigh-infinite planes than we had about most countries in the Inner Sea region! This time, rather than react to and incorporate other product lines, the Pathfinder Society team pitched <a href="/products/btpy9ng0"><em>Planes of Power</em></a>, secured it a spot on the schedule, and outlined it so that players, GMs, and authors alike could learn more about the elemental planes we're featuring over the next year.</p> 
               <p><a href="/products/btpy9ng0"><em>Planes of Power</em></a> also provided us with an opportunity to make the elemental planes stand out as the truly bizarre, wondrous, and primal places that they are. We aimed much higher than simply describing the Plane of Fire as a place that's hot or the Plane of Air as a floating realm. Rather, the nuances of each plane are lovingly detailed in 10-page chapters, which describe the realms' unique histories, inhabitants, places of interest, political intrigues, and more. Each chapter also includes a section of ground-level details about a planar metropolis.</p> 
               <p>Rounding out the book are chapters full of planar beasts and character options, including tools to help PCs explore the elemental planes and wield elemental energies no matter the setting. We're excited to say that <a href="/products/btpy9ng0"><em>Planes of Power</em></a> also provides a look at the elemental lords, including the unholy symbols for the evil lords shown above.</p> 
               <p>Aside from this breadth of information, the book flat out looks gorgeous. From its dynamic cover to its thematic page elements to its beautiful illustrations, we hope that <a href="/products/btpy9ng0"><em>Planes of Power</em></a>'s visuals inspire readers with infinite ideas for planar characters and adventures.</p>

              <div itemprop="articlebody"> 
               <p itemprop="description"><i>Today, we begin a strategy blog written by game historian <a href="http://erzo.org/shannon/index.phtml" target="_blank">Shannon Appelcline</a>. As Shannon says, these are strategies for one way to play the game, based on tabletop playthroughs of all three current Pathfinder Adventure Card Game Adventure Paths, plus about a gazillion plays of Obsidian Entertainment's addictive Pathfinder Adventures.</i></p> 
               <p>The Pathfinder Adventure Card Game is a complex game that supports extremely high replayability. That's because you can play it in many different ways. The core of playing PACG is understanding the three crucial resources that form the core of the game: <i>time</i>, <i>cards</i>, and <i>decks</i>.</p> 
               <h2>Time is the First Most Valuable Resource</h2> 
               <p>PACG has a constantly ticking clock. Normally, if you advance through 30 player-turns without completing your goal, you lose the game. It's a balance between two hourglasses: the blessings deck timer, which counts down the turns, and the location timer, which lays out what still needs to be explored.</p> 
               <p>That means that <i>everything</i>should be seen through the lens of time. If you fail to defeat a bane, that's not necessarily disastrous, but it <i>does</i> cost you a turn. Conversely, if you play a blessing or an ally that allows an extra exploration, or a detection spell that successfully enables an exploration, you gain a turn. Minimize your lost turns and maximize your gained turns and you'll practically guarantee a win.</p> 
               <p>With that said, running out of time and losing isn't a big deal. It just means that you need to play the adventure again. Don't put your character's life at risk to win an adventure, and if you get to the point where you decide you're losing, look toward other priorities (like improving your deck).</p> 
               <p><i>Corollary #1: Build decks to take extra turns.</i> Give your character cards that will maximize your turns. This is easy for Kyra, who has tons of blessings, and Lini, who recharges her animal companions. It's trickier for Ezren, who has no blessings, and Sajan, who needs to conserve his blessings for super punching. Though most characters should give preference to allies who give extra explorations, that's particularly important for these blessing-impaired characters. Characters like Ezren also need to concentrate on gaining turns via other means, such as the Detect Magic and Haste spells.</p> 
               <p><i>Corollary #2: Play cards to take extra turns.</i> This mostly refers to blessings: you want to be conservative about using them for their extra dice effect when they could otherwise provide extra turns. It's particularly easy to misuse blessings when you're trying to save a character who got backed into a dark alley by a bad combat. If you're looking at spending two or four blessings to save him, carefully consider whether it's worthwhile. Is saving the cards in his hand plus killing the monster really worth those two to four lost bonus turns? (Maybe, but you should make the calculation.)</p> 
               <p>You should even think about whether it's worth recharging a card like an ally that you could otherwise discard for a new turn. This is a tougher calculation because it's advantageous to keep cards in the deck, and you will <i>probably</i> eventually get to discard that card for its extra turn when it drifts back up through your deck.</p> 
               <p>The idea of focusing on cards' turn-gaining ability becomes moot if you've played aggressively enough that your blessing timer has caught up with your location timer. When this happens, become more willing to play your blessings and allies for purposes other than just pushing forward—particularly for improving your deck, another PACG priority.</p> 
               <p><i>Corollary #3: Don't worry about player count!</i> When you have more players, it feels like you need to play faster, but that isn't necessarily true. Whatever your player count, you just need to close two locations, then you have the right number of characters left to spread out and be ready to temporarily close all the locations when someone stumbles upon the villain.</p> 
               <p>With that said, player count does change the way that PACG plays. Lower player counts bring the blessing timer and the location timer into balance, but they decrease the amount of support you get from other players (in the form of blessings) and the amount of coverage you have for different skills. PACG is probably tougher with a smaller party… but that's not necessarily due to the timer.</p> 
               <h2>Cards Are the Second Most Valuable Resource</h2> 
               <p>PACG has another ticking clock: the cards in your character deck. If they run out, your character dies. And you're encouraged to run out because playing more cards generally helps you accrue time, and that's the <i>biggest</i> ticking clock in the game.</p> 
               <p>This means that Cure is the most important card in the whole game. It lets you recycle 1d4+1 cards, which could easily be 1d4+1 extra turns. If you know there are Cures in the game, then you can play more aggressively and make it more likely that you'll complete the scenarios.</p> 
               <p>The other healing spells and powers are important too. Kyra is likely the most powerful character in Rise of the Runelords because of her heavy density of blessings combined with her Heal power, which gives her the ability to return cards just by spending one of her plentiful Divine cards and a first exploration. Seelah is probably the second most powerful character if you take the Hospitalizer role, because she can freeform heal by burying Divine cards. And that's to say nothing of cards like Father Zantus, Staff of Minor Healing, and others.</p> 
               <p><i>Corollary #1: Give multiple heals to Divine casters.</i> Consider giving any Divine spellcaster in your game two Cures so that they'll come up frequently, and so that you can use one to recover the other if you roll badly on a recharge. At higher levels a Mass Cure or even a Pillar of Life can, of course, substitute for one of those Cures.</p> 
               <p><i>Corollary #2: Give healing ability to other characters!</i> This can take the form of Father Zantus, Staff of Minor Healing, or even Potion of Healing. This lets these characters play aggressively too, without worrying about having to hook up with Kyra, Seelah, Lini, or Lem.</p> 
               <p><i>Corollary #3: Back off if you need healing!</i> You never, ever want to lose your character to death in PACG. Do your best to ensure it's not a possibility. If you're getting to the point where your draw pile is the same size as your hand size, give up adventuring. Stay in a nice, safe, closed location while the rest of your fellows continue on. (And tell someone to come heal you!)</p> 
               <h2>Decks Are the Third Most Valuable Resource</h2> 
               <p>One of the trickiest aspects of PACG is that you're not just trying to win an individual game. You're also trying to improve your character to make it more likely that you'll win future games too. That means that you sometimes have to spend your short-term time resources and card resources to improve your long-term deck resources.</p> 
               <p><i>Corollary #1: Don't worry about gathering boons you don't want.</i> If you encounter a boon that's clearly not going to improve anyone's deck, and if it's not likely to give you extra turns or other notable advantages in your current game, don't expend resources to collect it.</p> 
               <p><i>Corollary #2: Do worry about gathering boons you do want.</i> If a card <i>would</i> improve someone's deck, expend the effort to collect it. If it's a big improvement, you should do this even if you have to spend turns (blessings) to do so, and maybe even if you might lose the game as a result.</p>

                  <tr>
                   <td style="padding-right: 20px;"> <p>Liz is one of the reasons that I'm here at Paizo. We had been friends online since the magazine days and way back then I proposed the idea of making a chat room for a group of fans to be able to chat off the messageboards, which we were on all the time anyway. After making the post, Liz stepped up and built it. Back in the early days of the chatroom she, along with a few other folks, first encouraged me to get into freelancing. After I decided to do so, I booked a trip to GenCon where I'd finally meet Liz and a couple other close friends in person for the first time.</p> <p>Liz didn't just make a chatroom for Paizo fans and make the messageboards a fun place, she also started <em>Wayfinder</em> with Hugo Solis. I was happy to be around for that magazine's infancy and help out with editing for the first half-dozen issues. Liz is also responsible for wrangling me into the secret project where she and I and a couple of other Werecabbages got a credit in the <em>Core Rulebook</em>!</p> <p>With such a commitment to the community, it's no surprise that six years ago, Liz got picked up by the big purple golem. We were so happy for her and knew that she would kick ass there and it was great to see her making a positive change in her life exploring a new career. Starting off in Customer Service, she went to Webstore Specialist to Community Manager (and wore a bunch of other hats along the way).</p> <p>A few years later, Liz was one of the first people I got in touch with when I was offered a job here, because I knew that she'd give it to me straight about what it was like at Paizo.</p> <p>Even though we don't work in the same department, I've greatly enjoyed working with Liz. We get to work side by side at conventions (where she has frequently taken pictures of me in boxes and posted them to the blog). Liz has always been a hard worker who gives a damn about what she's doing. I'm going to miss having her here as someone to talk to and rely on for a solid opinion on something. She always has a level head and makes good calls. It's going to be tough to fill her shoes. I'm gonna miss you, Liz!</p> <p style="text-align: right;">Adam Daigle<br> <i>Developer</i></p> <p>It's hard to imagine the Paizo office without Liz because she was already such an integral part of it by the time I showed up. Her influence in the Pathfinder community stretches so far and wide, that I admit I was a bit intimidated when I first met her. I had heard tales of her fiercely loyal friendship and delicious baked goods, and Liz wasted no time in extending that sense of community and family to me when I stepped in the door.</p> <p>Since that day she has been a fount of knowledge, advice, creativity, inspiration, and encouragement. She's not one to sit idly by and watch a peer suffer. She'll give you all the tricks she has up her sleeve to help, and if that doesn't do it she'll know which direction to point you. She spreads such joy and enthusiasm about the game, about art, and about life, and has always been the first to encourage those around her to do what they love. I know that I'm not alone in feeling that the time I've been honored to work with her has had a deep impact on me, both personally and professionally. As selfishly sad as I am that I won't be able to see her every day at work, I am beyond thrilled for the future that lies in pursuing her craft. I know that wherever there are rooms full of gamers sharing laughs and rolling dice, Liz won't ever be too far away.</p> <p style="text-align: right;">Katina Davis<br> <i>Customer Service Representative</i></p> <p>Liz was my friend before I ever started at Paizo, and was the bedrock of the Paizo fan community when I first started getting into Golarion. She was also a kickass roommate for many years, even if we did argue constantly over cat-rearing philosophies. It was amazing when we ended up coworkers. She's been so smart and passionate and friendly at every turn. The office is going to feel a lot emptier without her here, but I'm thrilled that she's moving on to bigger and better things!</p> <p style="text-align: right;">Crystal Frasier<br> <i>Developer</i></p> </td>
                   <td> <p>I first interacted with Liz as a third-party publisher of Pathfinder-compatible material. I wasn't joking when I dubbed her Paizo's Patron Saint of 3PP. Her professionalism, vast knowledge base, and friendly assistance with any issue or question I had as publisher of Rogue Genius Games had a major impact on our success, and on the success of Pathfinder-compatible third-party efforts in general. A endless round of thanks and applause, Liz!</p> <p style="text-align: right;">Owen K.C. Stephens<br> <i>Developer</i></p> <p>LIZ! Thank you so much for helping keep Paizo fans happy, and for keeping Paizo employees happy! You will be missed, but hopefully this means you'll have LOTS of free time now to draw me LOTS more Merisiel pictures, right? Well... even if you don't, have fun and good luck and keep gaming!</p> <p style="text-align: right;">James Jacobs<br> <i>Creative Director</i></p> <p>My very first experience with Liz was at Gen Con 2014. It was my first Gen Con and I was a bit starstruck seeing all these people who make the game I love. I went to the Paizo booth a few times, and ended up at the register Liz was running more than once. When I went to pickup my subscription was one of those times. I told her I was picking up my subs and gave her my name. She then, without looking anything up, said my email address and asked if that was me. Liz Courts liked my email address and had remembered it! LIZ COURTS liked my email address and remembered it! I spent what was probably a few hours making starstruck fanboy squeals at my friends. There were even more of those squeals this past Christmas. I love Star Wars. I love Pathfinder. Amiri is my favorite iconic. On my desk right now is a wonderful piece of Liz art (Liz is a wonderful artist!) of Amiri as an X-Wing pilot that she gave me for Christmas!</p> <p>Liz, I feel very fortunate for having been able to work with you, and more importantly be friends with you. It has always amazed me how much information you have hanging out in your head. That you remember every single item on our website is amazing. That you remember every single fandom of everyone around you is also amazing (and it makes every wallet attack you make a critical hit!)! I would wish you luck with your future endeavors but you are such a talented writer and artist that I know you don't need luck. The work you have put in to your craft will take you wherever you want to go. I will miss talking about Mass Effect, Dragon Age, and all of the fandoms. Thank you for everything, Liz! Peace and long life!</p> <p style="text-align: right;">Diego Valdez<br> <i>Customer Service Representative</i></p> <p>When I think of Liz, I immediately think of the Gen Con many years ago when she somehow got a hold of a creepy dolphin puppet, which she proceeded to wield like Pam from the cartoon Archer. A whole crew of us spent that last night of the show hanging around someone's hotel room, shooting the breeze while she made the dolphin puppet leer at us, turning every innocent comment into innuendo by virtue of its smarmy, knows-too-much smile. So while I could say all sorts of things about how awesome Liz has been for the company and the community, or how talented she is in a variety of fields, I'd be lying if I didn't say my first association with the name Liz Courts is "raunchy dolphin puppet."</p> <p>And I think that, in itself, may be the greatest praise.</p> <p style="text-align: right;">James L. Sutter<br> <i>Creative Director</i></p> <p>I met Liz for the first time at PaizoCon 2009 where she GM'd my very first convention game. Since then she has been an enthusiastic, supportive and amazing coworker, officemate and friend. I've been lucky enough to get to witness her growth as an artist and author and while I'm excited to see where her talent and dedication and love of gaming leads her, I'm going to miss the heck out of seeing her smile every time I peak over my computer.</p> <p style="text-align: right;">Sara Marie<br> <i>Customer Service Manager</i></p> <p>I will miss that Liz always has a relevant gif handy to help bring humor or sympathy to situations. And will I miss things like delicious brownies from the Department of Morale Adjustment. However, my wallet will NOT miss sneaky wallet gninja attacks, that are perfectly relevant-to-interests™.</p> <p style="text-align: right;">Sharaya<br> <i>Customer Service Representative</i></p> </td>

               <p>Liz was a guide when I first began at Paizo—sharing her fervor for Pathfinder, Paizo, the greater hobby of tabletop gaming, and helping me grow to truly care about and champion for our community. Over the last two years, our combined hopes to be the best Community Team we can be have driven us forward, and what is public-facing hasn't even scratched the surface of the passion behind the team and the ideas we've come up with together. I've learned professional and life lessons from Liz, and I will always be grateful for the opportunity I had to be her manager for this short while. She is a force, and I know whatever she does after today will be just as amazing as she is.</p> 
               <p>Please join us as we applaud Liz Courts and wish her luck on the next great unknown!</p>

               <p>Okay, that extended analogy got weird. Put plainly, we've finished the sanctioning documents for Hell's Rebels, <em>Down the Blighted Path</em>, <em>House on Hook Street</em>, and the latest four <a href="/pathfinder/tales/novels">Pathfinder Tales novels</a> (<a href="/products/btpy9e42"><em>Beyond the Pool of Stars</em></a>, <a href="/products/btpy9e43"><em>Bloodbound</em></a>, <a href="/products/btpy9e44"><em>Pirate's Prophecy</em></a>, and <a href="/products/btpy9e45"><em>Hellknight</em></a>—all of them delightful reads). You'll see the modules' sanctioning documents appearing on their respective pages imminently. All of the sanctioning documents will also appear as part of the upcoming update to the <a href="/pathfinderSociety/additionalResources">Additional Resources page</a>. We're still busily working on Adventure Paths and Modules both old and new, so more content is on the way!</p>

               <p itemprop="description">The <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/strangeAeons">Strange Aeons Adventure Path</a> is in the wild, and for some characters, that means questioning the reality that they wake up and find themselves in.

               <p>If you can't tell by the image above, I mean the <em>Stranger Things</em> series, which is full of '80s nostalgia for folks 'round my age (which, turns out, also happens to be a good chunk of the Paizo staff), not to mention just a whole lot of fun. Without getting too spoilery, let's just say that a small town is about to get its world flipped Upside-Down, and conspiracies are afoot in the town of Hawkins, Indiana. But this is a challenge—and the challenge is: make Eleven for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game.</p> 
               <p>I like to give away prizes, so let's get to the meat of it: First prize is the ENTIRE <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/strangeAeons">Strange Aeons Adventure Path</a> (all six volumes!), as well as a <strong>custom Paizo.com avatar</strong> with a piece of art from <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/strangeAeons">Strange Aeons</a>. We will also be selecting a second place winner, who will win hardcover copies of both <a href="/products/btpy9egu"><em>Occult Adventures</em></a> and <a href="/products/btpy9n5a"><em>Horror Adventures</em></a>! Your entry will be judged on presentation and theme, so let's get down to the rules for designing Eleven: </p>
               <ul> 
                <li><strong>Race</strong> Base race must be human.</li> 
                <li><strong>Ability Scores</strong>: 20 point buy.</li> 
                <li><strong>Template</strong>: You must use the <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/bestiary/monsterAdvancement.html#young-creature">young creature template</a>.</li> 
                <li><strong>Automatic Bonus Progression</strong>: Use the <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/unchained/magic/automaticBonusProgression.html">Automatic Bonus Progression</a> from <a href="/products/btpy9c25"><em>Pathfinder Unchained</em></a>.</li> 
                <li><strong>Wealth</strong>: One-half standard NPC wealth (<a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/creatingNPCs.html">as presented in the <em>Core Rulebook</em></a>), and no magic items that grant bonuses to AC, saving throws, and ability scores (as per <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/unchained/magic/automaticBonusProgression.html">Automatic Bonus Progression</a>).</li> 
               </ul> 
               <p></p> 
               <p>But that's not all! Here are the participation rules: </p>
               <ul> 
                <li>One entry per poster. Employees of Paizo, their immediate family members, and persons with whom such employees are domiciled are ineligible. Anyone who is currently employed full-time as a designer for a game company is ineligible. Anyone with a cover credit on a hardcover RPG book is ineligible. Anyone who has a design credit in 3 or more of Paizo's Pathfinder products is ineligible.</li> 
                <li>You must post your entries in this blog's discussion thread (please use spoiler tags).</li> 
                <li>Entries must be in the following format:</li>

               </div> 
               <p>Let's start things off today with this imposing Dwarf Slaver, as nasty a ginger as your player characters will ever encounter. With art based on the Chelish villain Kossrani from <a href="/products/btpy9g0q"><em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #97: In Hell's Bright Shadow</em></a>, this guy has enough personality to be a hero OR a villain. He's also a good illustration of how things can go wrong during the sculpting and approval process, and how good WizKids is at fixing our mistakes! Take a close look at Kossrani's shield, with the awesome carved-in symbol of Asmodeus. Well, it would have been awesome if it hadn't been sculpted in reverse. You see, sometimes when we're laying out books, we flip an image on its Y axis to make for a more interesting page layout. This usually works with no problems, but occasionally, as in the case of <em>Pathfinder #97</em>, something like a holy symbol gets reversed and causes a bit of a problem. In this case, I didn't notice until the paint master came into the Paizo offices and I was holding it in my hand. Happily, WizKids was able to fill in the mold for the cut-out part of the shield, and will instead be producing the (correct) Asmodeus symbol using a tampo stamp. All praise be to the Lord of the Nine Hells! Miracles really do happen, you guys! The Dwarf Slaver is a Medium figure slated at the uncommon rarity.</p>

                <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160908-TorrentKnight.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160908-TorrentKnight_360.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Up next is the Torrent Hellknight, based on the Wayne Reynolds character design for the <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/hellsRebels">Hell's Rebels</a> character Lictor Octavio Sabinus from the cover of <a href="/products/btpy9gcx"><em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #98</em></a>. This is our third or fourth Hellknight in <a href="/pathfinderbattles">Pathfinder Battles</a> so far (I've lost count!), and he's definitely one of my favorites. I think I've found that, as cool as all-black armor looks on the printed page, it sometimes results in fairly underwhelming prepainted figures, at least color-wise. Thankfully, the blue cape and silver scale armor in Wayne's design gives us some interesting colors to pop with this guy, and I think he'll be a popular choice for player characters and NPCs alike. Heck, get a couple of them and they serve as pretty killer elite guards for any of the various Chelaxian (or even just generally evil) NPCs we've released to date. The Torrent Hellknight is a Medium, uncommon figure.</p>

                <a href="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160908-JilliaBanilus.jpg"><img src="//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160908-JilliaBanilus_360.jpeg"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Speaking of despicable Chelaxian villains, here we have Jilia Bainilus, the former mayor of the city of Kintargo and a very interesting character in the <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/hellsRebels">Hell's Rebels Adventure Path</a>. Calling Jilia a villain is a bit of a stretch (as well as a bit of a spoiler), so in the interests of not ruining anything let's just say her Facebook alignment status is "It's Complicated." Jilia's look comes direct from the brush of Pathfinder superstar artist Wayne Reynolds and the cover of <a href="/products/btpy9grk"><em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #99</em></a>. I think she's got a fantastic look for a player character noble swordswoman. Although Jilia's official game statistics are... let's just say, "somewhat different," to me this is pretty much the perfect swashbuckler miniature, and I can't wait to use it in my games. Jilia Bainilus is a Medium, rare figure.</p>

               </div> 
               <p>After one of my fun Dragon Con panels this last weekend, a dedicated Pathfinder fan came up to ask me if we might ever do a Pathfinder Battles figure of a Strix, the dark-skinned primitive winged folk who feature so heavily in the <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/hellsRebels">Hell's Rebels Adventure Path</a>, Liane Merciel's wonderful <a href=""><em>Nightglass</em></a> novel, and elsewhere. I was pleased to not only say "yes, we will!" but to say "yes, we will, as soon as humanly possible. In fact, we've got one in the very next set!" So here you go, Pathfinder fan. Your very own Strix Sorcerer, suitable for use as a player character or a nasty winged villain. Huzzah! The Strix Sorcerer is a Medium, uncommon figure.</p> 
               <p>Next week, I'll be back with more awesome previews for <a href="/products/btpy9kcu"><em>Deadly Foes</em></a>. A formal announcement of the next set should hit soon. In the meantime, I'm currently working on the NEXT setlist with our recently returned Director of Licensing, Mike Kenway. We're starting with a blank slate and a VERY loose theme for this one, so please let me know if you have any requests! I'm particularly interested to hear what major races or groups you'd like to see us cover with multiple "like" figures in the same set. By my count we've done goblins, orcs, hobgoblins, bugbears, ghouls, and a few others.</p> 
               <p>What else do you want or need? Let us know in the comments.</p> 
               <p>Until then, I remain...</p>

            <p itemprop="description">With <a href="/products/btpy9nft"><em>Pathfinder Player Companion: Haunted Heroes</em></a>, we wanted to explore exactly that—what happens when a PC gets haunted? But that wasn't the ORIGINAL incarnation of this book. Once upon a time, back when several of us were shut away in one of Paizo's enormous Think Tanks and tasked with coming up with ideas for the Player Companion line, many suggestions got bandied about—one of which was something called an "Exorcist's Handbook." One of the things that really appealed to me about that, of course, is the fact that exorcism movies are one of the most enduring and popular sub-genres of horror, and I loved the idea of exploring the concept of how you would make an exorcist in Pathfinder. But the more we thought about it, the more we realized that there was more to the idea than just rules for building exorcists—and so the book expanded into new haunting territories.</p>

               <p>So now, you not only get rules for dealing with what happens when your allies get possessed by evil spirits... but you get rules for what happens to YOU when you get possessed... and not necessarily by unwelcome and/or evil entities.</p>

               <p>But don't take my word for it. Check out some of the illustrations of haunted heroes from the book below. Don't they look like they're having the time of their lives? Wouldn't you want your character to have as much fun as them? Well, now you can!</p> 
               <p>All you have to do is to tell your GM, the next time she or he asks you to roll a Will saving throw for your character... "Oh, no thanks. I'll voluntarily fail that save." PRESTO! Instant character upgrade!</p>
