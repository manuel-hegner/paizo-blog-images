  \ \n    <p>I'm currently on a road trip through Oregon, Idaho, and Washington, getting\
  \ a bit of personal time before delving back into convention season. John Compton\
  \ and Jason Bulmahn just returned from GameStorm in Portland and from brief conversations\
  \ the convention seemed to go well (maybe we can get a few more details in a future\
  \ blog!). When I get back on Monday, I've got a few more weeks in the office packed\
  \ with blog writing, con planning, meetings, finalizing details Pathfinder Society\
  \ for Second Edition, and working on items for the current programs, before I head\
  \ out to KoboldCon in Colorado Springs.</p> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Regarding\
  \ current programs, we need your help! As we approach the launch of Starfinder Society\
  \ Year 2, we are calling all Starfinders who've championed the Second Seeker faction\
  \ and purchased the Rising Star boon to send in your character information. For\
  \ those with the boon in their sights, the deadline for submissions is May 1 at\
  \ midnight Pacific time. Any items received after the deadline will be retained\
  \ for future use. Players should email their character information to us at <a href=\"\
  mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com\">organizedplay@paizo.com</a>. We reply to all submissions,\
  \ so if you've sent it in and not heard back, please resend.</p> \n    <h2>Campaign\
  \ Coins</h2> \n    <p>We distributed no campaign coins in March due to our lessened\
  \ travel schedule. Huge thank yous to all that sent in recommendations over the\
  \ past month. We would love to have more suggestions for deserving members of our\
  \ community. Anyone can make a recommendation, not just the Venture-Officer or GM\
  \ teams. Please take a moment and email me at¬†organizedplay@paizo.com¬†with their\
  \ name, location, and the reasons you feel they deserve recognition for their service.\
  \ This message should be a synopsis of what the volunteer does that benefits your\
  \ community, and does not need to be overly detailed or involved. If you are able,\
  \ please include what events they may attend in 2019 so that we can either make\
  \ awards in person (preferred) or make arrangements for remote presentation.</p>\
  \ \n    <h2>Stars</h2> \n    <p>We are now into the second quarter of 2019 and convention\
  \ season started in earnest. Our GMs this month took advantage of all the opportunities\
  \ to run games and earned their 5th star. To achieve this milestone, GMs run 150\
  \ games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 Special scenarios,\
  \ as well as run a game for a venture-captain. A conservative estimate of time needed\
  \ to reach 5-stars is 650 hours! To the GMs listed below, thank you very much for\
  \ the time and energy you spend running Pathfinder Society games! Huge congratulations\
  \ on your achievement!</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>Chris Murphy<br> Bill Swathwood</p>\
  \ \n    </blockquote> \n    <h2>Novas &amp; Glyphs</h2> \n    <p>After soliciting\
  \ opinions from a variety of sources and then lots of brainstorming and discussion,\
  \ we formulated a plan for Novas which also will apply to Pathfinder Society Glyphs\
  \ later this year.</p> \n    <p>Requirements will remain similar to the existing\
  \ Pathfinder Society Stars. A GM will need to run 150 games, of which ten must be\
  \ special events, and the total must include 50 unique scenarios. Venture-Captain\
  \ recommendation and processing are where the change comes in. After listening to\
  \ quite a bit of feedback about what being a 5-star GM means, we've decided to add\
  \ a qualitative element to the requirements. Our tech department is assisting us\
  \ in making the process automated, so GMs qualifying for their 5th star won't have\
  \ to wait for the monthly processing.</p> \n    <p>To add the qualitative element,\
  \ we increased the number of adjudicated games 1 to 3. To help schedule the additional\
  \ games, GMs can request Venture-Captain observation any time after their 100th\
  \ game. Observations may be held in person, via web games, on VTTs, via PbP, or\
  \ any other medium that is currently being used by the community. Venture-Captains\
  \ will evaluate GMs on 5-6 criteria based on a published rubric. There will not\
  \ be numerical scoring, but a system of does not meet/meets/exceeds expectations.\
  \ GMs will need to accumulate a better than average score on each evaluation, which\
  \ means they can have all meets and 1 exceeds expectations and qualify. They could\
  \ also have a does not meet, 2-3 meets, and 2 exceeds expectations and qualify.\
  \ A GM cannot complete more than three evaluations in a weekend. Any GM that fails\
  \ to meet the criteria may wait three months and try again.</p> \n    <p>At this\
  \ point, we have a rubric that we are soliciting feedback on and working on the\
  \ last bits of tech. I hope to have the final bits hammered out in the next few\
  \ weeks, so we can publish the rubric and get our 4-novas GMs started on their path.</p>\
  \ \n    <h2>Upcoming Conventions</h2> \n    <p>Want to attend a convention in the\
  \ next few months? Check out the list below! The list includes all the event support\
  \ requests received to date. If you see one missing, ping the organizer and have\
  \ them submit their event or have them email me at <a href=\"mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com\"\
  >organizedplay@paizo.com</a> to discuss. All of the conventions on the list maintain\
  \ a web presence, be it website, social media page, or Warhorn listing. If you are\
  \ interested in attending in either capacity, check out their website or contact\
  \ the local Venture-Officer for more information!</p> \n    <blockquote style=\"\

  \ to attend. At a minimum, the event should supply room(s) and badges, and the more\
  \ costs covered, the easier it is to put on our schedule. Note: staff cannot attend\
  \ conventions the last weekend in May or the weekend of Gen Con. We've moved our\
