    \ leadership, and place in the myriad societies of Golarion. Steal a taste of\
    \ the hidden knowledge that rests inside the much-coveted chronicles, and study\
    \ the creeds by which all pathfinders must abide. All of which will prepare you\
    \ for volume two, in which Jason Bulmahn presents the first chapter in the wanderings\
    \ of Eando Kline, pathfinder extraordinaire.... James Sutter Assistant Editor,\
