  \ \n    <p>I must admit I'm not an RPG player. I didn't grow up playing D&amp;D,\
  \ and never picked it up along the way.</p> \n    <p>However, that hasn't stopped\
  \ me from enjoying editing the <a href=\"/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics\"\
  >Pathfinder comics</a> at Dynamite. Getting to know the characters and settings\
  \ of Paizo's rich Pathfinder world has been a treat. I've watched the iconic characters\
  \ of the game come to life, and gotten to know how they talk and behave: Seoni the\
  \ sorcerer, Valeros the fighter, Kyra the cleric, Harsk the dwarf ranger, Ezren\
  \ the wizard, and Merisiel the elf rogue. The world of Pathfinder works well with\
  \ the strengths of comics as a medium. There's no story too big to tell when working\
  \ in comics, and the stories so far have been pretty grand, thanks to Jim Zub.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>In <a href=\"/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics/pfComicsVol1\"\
  ><em>Dark Waters Rising</em></a>, the companions investigated a strange magic that\
  \ gripped the goblin tribes of Varisia, changing and unifying them. At the heart\
  \ of the strange evolution was an ancient evil force that nearly killed the adventurers\
  \ before they found a way to overcome it.</p> \n    <p>In <a href=\"/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics/pfComicsVol2\"\
  ><em>Of Tooth and Claw</em></a>, the group went on a hunt for the creature terrorizing\
  \ the locals of Sandpoint (Black Fang the dragon), and in the process found more\
  \ than they bargained for. A seemingly simple monster hunt became a twisted tale\
  \ of danger and betrayal as the Cult of Lamashtu exacted its revenge.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>In <a href=\"/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics/pfComicsVol3\"\
  ><em>City of Secrets</em></a>, our heroes headed to the city of Magnimar. As Ezren\
  \ sought an audience with the Pathfinder Society, his adventuring allies explored\
  \ the city's ancient magic, well-hidden secrets, and deep political divides. The\
  \ dangers and opportunities of the big city were almost too much for the group to\
  \ endure...</p> \n    <p>And that brings us to our newest series, <a href=\"/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics/pfComicsOrigins\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder: Origins</em></a>, which delves deeper into the histories of the\
  \ Pathfinder iconic characters, and introduces new characters to the comics. Get\
  \ ready to see Amiri the barbarian, Seelah the paladin, Lini the gnome druid, Seltiyel\
  \ the half-elf magus, Sajan the monk, and Lem the halfling bard come to four-color\
  \ life, as they each interact with the core iconics in brand new adventures.</p>\

  ><em>Pathfinder: Origins</em></a> is that it's written by key Paizo staff: Erik\
  \ Mona, F. Wesley Schneider, and James L. Sutter have all helped create the constantly\
  \ expanding world of the Pathfinder RPG. And they have done a fantastic job here\
  \ of not only telling great individual stories, but working to interweave them in\
  \ this series. The result is something fresh, new, and fun. Take a look at the sample\
  \ pages below by Erik Mona and artist Tom Garcia for just a hint of the exciting\
  \ action in store.</p> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\"><a href=\"/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics/pfComicsOrigins\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder: Origins</em></a> ships monthly February through July from Dynamite,\
  \ and is available right here on Paizo.com. Each issue will contain a new playable\
  \ map/poster, as with prior issues. We can't wait to hear what you think of it.\
  \ And come back later to find out what we have planned after <em>Origins</em>!</p>\
