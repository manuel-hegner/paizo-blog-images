  \ \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">It’s been a while since we’ve heard from our\
  \ friends at the Order of the Amber Die, but they’re still at it! There were some\
  \ scheduling complications and their tackling of Doomsday Dawn for the playtest,\
  \ but they’ve recently finished their marathon of <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy9xa1?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-125-Tower-of-the-Drowned-Dead\"\
  >Pathfinder Adventure Path #125: Tower of the Drowned Dead</a> and sent me their\
  \ report. I also got a chance to talk with GM Adam Smith at Gen Con a couple of\
  \ weeks ago, and he let me know that they have more amazing things to share with\
  \ us once they wrap up the Ruins of Azlant Adventure Path—so stay tuned! Also, keep\
  \ in mind that this blog contains spoilers for the adventure and Adventure Path,\
  \ so be careful if you’re playing this one!</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>If\
  \ you are new to our work, for the past several years the Order has been completing\
  \ projects for the Paizo blog. Our most recent work, The Azlant Odyssey, started\
  \ in 2017—paused to complete the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgfm?Order-of-the-Amber-DieDoomsday-Dawn-Playtest\"\
  >Pathfinder Playtest</a>—and is now nearing its conclusion with volumes five and\
  \ six of the Ruins of Azlant Adventure Path! For those looking to refresh themselves\
  \ on the campaign, here are the first four parts:</p> \n     <p>The Azlant Odyssey\
  \ <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkc1?Order-of-the-Amber-DieThe-Azlant-Odyssey-Part-1\"\
  >Part 1</a>, <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkfm?Order-of-the-Amber-DieThe-Azlant-Odyssey-Part-2\"\
  >Part 2</a>, <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo5lksq?Order-of-the-Amber-DieThe-Azlant-Odyssey-Part-3\"\
  >Part 3</a>, and <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkyn?Order-of-the-Amber-DieThe-Azlant-Odyssey-Part-4\"\
  >Part 4</a>.</p> \n     <p>We have been to the semi-finals of an Adventure Path\
  \ plenty of times before, but what worried our party about part five of this particular\
  \ AP was what we knew about our goal. The information we gathered told us that inside\
  \ the Alabaster Trident, a massive tower built during the age of thriving Azlant,\
  \ resided a lich who had spent the last few 10,000 years creating a legion of undead\
  \ abominations. In our chase to stop a veiled master from securing a weapon of catastrophic\
  \ power, we had to go to the Alabaster Trident and seek out this lich. The tower\
  \ sank along with Azlant; therefore, we expected to face many levels of undead in\
  \ a submerged dungeon-crawl, and there was no guarantee we would find air within.\
  \ There wasn't a single one of us that didn't fear ending up like the lich's name,\
  \ \"Auberon the Drowned.\"</p> \n     <p>This marathon also carried with it some\
  \ out-of-game emphasis for us, as it would mark our 150th published adventure completed\
  \ since the founding of the Order in 1987. With such an occasion on hand, we'd have\
  \ a full house with extra live-NPCs throughout. Our talented rookie, Robert Pontious,\
  \ flew in from Rhode Island with his hair and beard dyed grey to match his role\
  \ as Ezren. Author and <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo5ldj9?Meet-the-Intern-Savannah\"\
  >former Paizo intern Savannah Broadway</a> arrived from Seattle to attend her first\
  \ marathon since <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo5lk5x?Order-of-the-Amber-DieThe-Strange-Aeons\"\
  >The Strange Aeons Experiment</a>; she would take the role of Aoinse, an awakened\
  \ clockwork servant of Amaznen.</p> \n     <p>To add to the immersion of this multi-day\
  \ dive into a submerged tower, our GM turned down the air-conditioning to a cool\
  \ 63 degrees, and we kept the lights low in the areas that were not lit. Most significantly\
  \ though, the master craftsmanship of <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BlackBardStudios\"\
  >Black Bard Studios</a> took this marathon to new heights, by creating an entire\
  \ scale model of the Alabaster Trident that stood about 8 feet high! Room-for-room\
  \ and level-for-level, it was an accurate 3D model which allowed us to perfectly\
  \ experience this adventure's spatial challenges. Further, as we explored the tower\
  \ throughout the course of the marathon, we removed each level and kept it on display\
  \ as a constant reminder of the architectural layout of the tower.</p> \n     <div\

  \ 80 hours, 5min</li> \n      <li><b>Session Hours:</b> 49hrs, 50min</li> \n   \
  \  </ul> \n     <h2>Highlights From \"Tower of the Drowned Dead\"</h2> \n     <ul>\
  \ \n      <li>We faced plenty of clockworks in the tower, even a nightmarish gargantuan\
  \ clockwork infused with the soul of a kraken—and there was no way in the nine layers\
  \ of Hell we were fighting it. Instead, we scouted the level and brought down the\
  \ wall closest to the stairway it was guarding. We just needed Valeros (an aquanaut)\
  \ and Koloshkora (locathah ranger) to go base-to-base with it for a couple of rounds\
  \ while the rest of us swam past. No worries though, we had aquatic life insurance\
  \ in the form of <i>freedom of movement</i>.</li> \n      <li>Beneath the Alabaster\
  \ Trident was a level known as the \"Vaults,\" a secluded place of horror and torture.\
  \ The master of the Vaults, an aboleth nosferatu sorcerer, calmly explained that\
  \ it must destroy our party to save us from an undead fate similar to itself. A\
  \ round-one <i>sunbeam</i> from Kyra ended the fight in twelve seconds—lights out.</li>\
  \ \n      <li>Keen senses were vital when trying to stay one step ahead of Auberon,\
  \ who knew early on that we were inside his home. Our Player Captain, Matt Hardin,\
  \ managed to get Koloshkora to touch a 68 Perception at just 12th level. Mark it\
  \ down.</li> \n      <li>If you thought the author would keep you in one place the\
  \ whole time, welcome to the Omen Dominion: a timeless demiplane that predated even\
  \ the Alabaster Trident. We went from spending forty-five session hours underwater,\
  \ to being surrounded by the lively sounds of a forest. It was here that we got\
  \ to choose the ending we wanted and decided to engage in our first-ever negotiations\
  \ with a lich.</li> \n     </ul> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/081719_amberdie_image003.jpg\"\

  ></a> \n     </div> \n     <h2>The Odyssey</h2> \n     <p>Handling the challenges\
  \ involved with submerged dungeon-crawling was definitely one of the tougher experiences\
  \ we've faced as adventurers over the decades. This is OAD though, and we were ready\
  \ for it with a strong playbook and spell stack: <i>slipstream</i>, <i>life bubble</i>,\
  \ <i>ride the waves</i>, and <i>greater longstrider</i> were key factors in our\
  \ win. Actually, between our <i>apparatus</i> of the crab and an Elven <i>folding\
  \ boat</i> we came across (which we boldly rechristened as the <i>Even Deeper</i>),\
  \ we're traversing ancient Azlant in style!</p> \n     <h2>Character Deaths</h2>\
  \ \n     <ul> \n      <li>Author Ron Lundeen is no stranger to putting our characters\
  \ down. Heck, in our playthrough of <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo5ljda?Order-of-the-Amber-DieThe-Strange-Aeons\"\
  >Dreams of the Yellow King</a>, Ron's animate dream killed one of his own prominent\
  \ NPCs. He's always fair though. This time a banshee wailed and Ezren missed his\
  \ save.</li> \n      <li>It's quite possible that no creature strikes more fear\
  \ into the hearts of Order members than a shining child. Apparently, an aquatic\
  \ shining child does exist, and it's called a pelagic child. They are sometimes\
  \ encountered in pairs, or even two pairs as happened in this adventure. It didn't\
  \ take long for the Amber Die to deliver a critical hit with a <i>searing ray</i>,\
  \ which removed Aoinse from our roster. Adam Daigle bears some responsibility for\
  \ the cruelty of pelagic children as well, so the author and managing developer\
  \ could kindly apologize to our party (and Mikko Kallio) for permanently destroying\
  \ our beloved clockwork priestess.</li> \n     </ul> \n     <h3>Best Quote From\
  \ Marathon 5</h3> \n     <p>(watching Nieran, our Mordant Spire elf ally, surpass\
  \ 500 damage while clearing a scrag nest in the top levels of the tower)</p> \n\
  \     <p><b>Ezren:</b> \"...\"</p> \n     <p><b>Kyra:</b> \"...\"</p> \n     <p><b>Valeros:</b>\
  \ \"...\"</p> \n     <p><b>Nieran:</b> \"What? It's like shooting fish in a barrel.\
  \ Not that humans could do it.\"</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\

  \ Auberon for information, and now we're headed back to the undersea city of Talasantri\
  \ to drop off the daughter of one of our merfolk friends. After that, we'll check\
  \ on the colony of Talmandor's Bounty for a quick resupply and to make sure things\
  \ are in good shape before we head to the location of a secret Azlanti facility\
  \ called the Compass. We learned that this facility stores several (yes, several)\
  \ doomsday devices, and we expect it to be at least partially underwater. Our equipment\
  \ is solid, our spell selections are on point, and party coherency is at its peak.\
  \ Yeah, let's get a little cockier than we were in the previous blog: This is the\
  \ best position we've had when staring down the final volume of any Adventure Path.\
  \ Veiled masters, you're not in control anymore.</p> \n     <h2>More Content</h2>\
