  \ \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">In early 2021, Toy Vault debuted two 1,000-piece\
  \ jigsaw puzzle products featuring licensed art from Pathfinder. The initial two\
  \ designs both featured the work of legendary fantasy artist Wayne Reynolds, who\
  \ has produced breathtaking scenes of adventure and intrigue for Pathfinder since\
  \ its inception nearly 20 years ago.</p> \n     <p>The <em><a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq027jq?Pathfinder-1000-Piece-Puzzle-Core-Rulebook\"\
  >Core Rulebook</a></em> design features iconic characters from the RPG, including\
  \ Harsk the dwarven ranger, Merisiel the elven rogue, and Kyra the human cleric,\
  \ all doing battle with a massive, fire-breathing dragon.</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  >Bestiary</a></em> features some more of the fantasy world’s monstrous inhabitants,\
  \ including three mischievous kobolds; an enraged ogre; and a giant, menacing hydra.</p>\

  ></p>\n     </div> \n     <p>When asked about his history with producing fantasy\
  \ art like the imagery featured in these two puzzles, Reynolds said, “I have been\
  \ working in the RPG industry for almost 30 years, with my first piece of art being\
  \ featured in 1993.</p> \n     <p>“I was working with Paizo when they took over\
  \ Dragon and Dungeon Magazines,” Reynolds explained. “I was doing some cover art\
  \ for them, so when they started Pathfinder, I was one of the first people they\
  \ approached about providing art for the game.</p> \n     <p>“It is exciting to\
  \ be able to work on something from the ground level. My experience with Pathfinder\
  \ has been massively enjoyable. I just love everything about that sort of world.”\
  </p> \n     <p>When asked about what pieces of art his personal favorites are to\
  \ create, Reynolds said, “Mainly the iconic characters, as my specialty is in character\
  \ design. I love being able to tie history to fantasy, and I always do a lot of\
  \ historical research before beginning work on that type of a project.”</p> \n \
  \    <p>Speaking specifically about his art being used to create jigsaw puzzle products,\
  \ as well as how he thinks he’d fare putting them together himself, Reynolds said,\
  \ “I like doing jigsaw puzzles. They are relaxing, and I think they also make for\
  \ a good exercise as an artist. I am probably the wrong person to do a puzzle featuring\
  \ my own artwork, though, because I already know the image so well.</p> \n     <p>“\
  I imagine it would be sort of like a musician dancing to their own music,” Reynolds\
  \ added.</p> \n     <p>Fans of Pathfinder, Wayne Reynolds, and fantasy art in general\
  \ have made these jigsaw puzzle items two of Toy Vault’s most popular new offerings\
  \ this year, and it is with great excitement that we announce two more brand new\
  \ puzzles featuring Pathfinder imagery—<em>Gamemastery Guide and Gods &amp; Magic.</em></p>\
  \ \n     <p><em><a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq0294z?Pathfinder-1000-Piece-Puzzle-Gamemastery-Guide\"\
  >Gamemastery Guide</a></em> once again showcases a wonderful piece of Reynolds art,\
  \ this time depicting Alaznist, one of the game’s villains, ascending a staircase\
  \ while holding onto an impressive-looking spear-type weapon in one hand. Towering\
  \ above her is a large black dragon with giant horns, red eyes, and wings extended.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><em><a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02950?Pathfinder-1000-Piece-Puzzle-Gods-Magic\"\
  >Gods &amp; Magic</a></em> features work by the talented Russian artist Ekaterina\
  \ Burmak. The scene depicts the Starstone near the top, with three characters below.\
  \ These three characters are Cayden Cailean, Iomedae, and Norgorber, all of whom\
  \ ascended to godhood after touching the Starstone, according to official Pathfinder\
  \ lore.</p> \n     <p>These two all-new Pathfinder puzzles are available now, just\
  \ in time for the 2021 holiday season. For more information on Toy Vault, please\
