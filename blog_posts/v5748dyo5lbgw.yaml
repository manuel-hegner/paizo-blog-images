  date\">Friday, September 17, 2010</p> \n   <p>I had the pleasure of meeting and\
  \ running a game for Kyle and Nani Pratt at PaizoCon a few years back, and since\
  \ then Facebook has brought me occasional awesome updates from their campaign. But\
  \ when THIS showed up, it was too awesome not to repost here. Check it out, with\
  \ the whole story by the mad geniuses behind what looks like an incredible campaign!</p>\
  \ \n   <p> (Forewarning to Legacy of Fire players, minor spoilers might follow.)</p>\
  \ \n   <p>F. Wesley Schneider <br>Managing Editor</p> \n   <blockquote> \n    <p>Nani\
  \ and I actually took the inspiration from the battle market that someone else made\
  \ a year ago from <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lamv\">here</a>. Originally we\
  \ thought we were going to just make something exactly the same, but then when we\
  \ noticed how good the map was, we thought we could blow it up properly to give\
  \ a good \"full immersion\" for the market. So my wife Nani took the image into\
  \ Photoshop, sharpened the image, and then increased the scale to 1 inch. When it\
  \ was all said and done, we printed it out on ~30 8.5 x 11 pieces of paper and cemented\
  \ it onto foam board. We had envisioned making the columns look better... but we\
  \ sadly ran out of time before the game so we had to hurry with a makeshift styrofoam\
  \ solution!</p> \n    <p>We really wanted to make our Legacy of Fire game have immersion\
  \ and put us all into the feel of the game. It's what makes the Paizo products so\
  \ great, so we're trying to go the extra mile with this one. All of our players\
  \ were so surprised we had this game aid and thought it was wonderful. It really\
  \ made everyone understand exactly what the market was like (and just how huge it\
  \ is compared to the characters themselves. We actually already had the <a href=\"\
  /pathfinder/pathfinderTerrain/v5748btpy8763\">Ruined Crypt of Kelmarane</a> made\
  \ for after this, and decided we wanted to go the extra mile. I think our players\
  \ are going to be really surprised at this one too. Hopefully World Works finishes\
  \ up the Garden from the next AP in time!</p> \n    <p>The fight itself was completely\
  \ memorable. Our entire party snuck in through the north entrance using Undrella's\
  \ key. Our rogue, a goblin, scouted ahead in the guise as a member of the battle\
  \ market, and ended up talking with both the gnolls in the guardroom and Hurvank.\
  \ With some very good bluff checks he convinced the poor ogre that the gnolls had\
  \ set him up to lose in his last bout with Haleen. Hurvank then went over to the\
  \ gnolls in the guardroom imagining that each one was Haleen and started to strangle\
  \ them all to death. The goblin quickly went over and pitoned the second door to\
  \ the guard room, trapping the remaining guards inside, scaring and confusing the\
  \ gnolls on the first floor. Meanwhile the rest of the party (who didn't know what\
  \ was going on) heard an ogre running across the market yelling about how he was\
  \ going to kill Haleen (all three of them). The character with the \"Finding Haleen\"\
  \ trait went rushing in to attack the ogre... which caused the bugbears to join\
  \ the fight against the PCs fighting the ogre. Meanwhile, the gnolls all were trying\
  \ to kill the ogre and had no clue what was going on. After about 10 more rounds\
  \ of confusion, the remaining gnolls/defenders on the upper terraces finally figured\
  \ out what was going on and rushed to protect the remainder of the battle market.\
  \ By this time, though, the damage was done and a large number of the forces were\
  \ dead by ogre/bugbear/gnoll/PC hands.</p> \n    <p>Having the market made prior\
  \ to this made the combat incredibly easy to run. Instead of just describing how\
  \ far up the terraces were we just placed the gnolls and described how they were\
  \ shooting down from above. It was a GREAT aid!</p> \n    <div align=\"center\"\
