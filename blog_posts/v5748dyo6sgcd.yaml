  \    </div> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">While much of the fun in <a href=\"\
  /products/btpya20r?Starfinder-Alien-Archive-2\"><em>Alien Archive 2</em></a> for\
  \ players is looking at new playable species, there's much more player-facing content\
  \ than just aliens to make into new characters. Like the first <em>Alien Archive</em>,\
  \ we wanted to help describe the strangeness of a science-fantasy universe with\
  \ rules elements any character can pick up and use.</p> \n    <p>Unlike <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9ujg?Starfinder-Alien-Archive\"><em>Alien Archive</em></a>, we made\
  \ sure to create an index (Appendix 9: Rules Options) to list them all in one place\
  \ for easy reference.</p> \n    <p>There are lots of items, including weapons (such\
  \ as the phasic scythe), defensive items (such as the adaptive defense module),\
  \ technological items (such as the plasma diverter), hybrid items (from the <i>mi-go\
  \ brain cylinder</i> to the <i>Shotalashu saddle</i>), magic items (such as the\
  \ <i>calecor skull-globe</i>), a surprising number of augmentations (six of them!)\
  \ , and even a computer upgrade (the telepathic user interface).</p> \n    <p>Each\
  \ of those is tied to a specific creature entry, in ways that help define that creature's\
  \ place in the galaxy. For example, the glass serpent is a terrifying ambush predator\
  \ that roams the blasted wastelands of Eox (though similar creatures have been found\
  \ on dozens of planets, including many outside the Pact Worlds). The scales of a\
  \ glass serpent can absorb and bend light, which the creature controls with its\
  \ musculature to become invisible. While a glass serpent's skin isn't a continuous\
  \ cloak of invisibility just because you remove and present it, it can be used as\
  \ the basis for stealth technology, including the glass skin augmentation and lightwarp\
  \ inlay armor upgrade (previewed below).</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\">\n  \

  \ Inlay</b></p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Price:</b> 5,000 <b>Level:</b>\
  \ 6</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Capacity:</b> 10 <b>Usage: </b>1/round</p>\

  \ </p>\n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Bulk:</b> L</p> \n     <p>This specialized\
  \ coating of glass serpent scales shifts its collective angle in response to localized\
  \ electrical fields created by a delicate circuitry inlay, allowing the bending\
  \ of light around you. You can activate this inlay as a standard action to become\
  \ temporarily invisible (as the <i>invisibility</i> spell, save that the process\
  \ is purely technological rather than magical). This invisibility lasts until you\
  \ deactivate it (which you can do as part of any other action) or the inlay runs\
  \ out of charges. A lightwarp inlay's charges replenish each day.</p> \n    </blockquote>\
  \ \n    <p>There are also two feats (Polymorph Adept and Squox Companion), which\
  \ tie to specific new options, one of which is obviously an element of magic that\
  \ so far Starfinder hasn't gone intoâ€”polymorphing.</p> \n    <p>A set of core rules\
  \ present a flexible set of general guidelines for what happens when magic changes\
  \ your form and then a set of variable level spells (<i>polymorph</i> and <i>baleful\
  \ polymorph</i>, along with mass versions of each) give spellcasters access to those\
  \ shapechanging powers. A number of forms are presented (from simple kalo form to\
  \ more complex blue dragon and fire elemental forms) to allow polymorphing to be\
  \ accessed quickly, but the rules are also presented to allow a player and GM to\
  \ build forms for nearly any conceivable creature. After all it's a big galaxy out\
  \ there, and there's no telling what weird things a character might want to change\
  \ into!</p> \n    <p>Owen K.C. Stephens<br> <i>Starfinder Design Lead</i></p> \n\
