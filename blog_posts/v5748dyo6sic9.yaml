  \    </div> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">I’m Aaron Shanks,\
  \ Director of Marketing, and it is my privilege to introduce to you a group of professional\
  \ geeks I call Paizo’s marketing+ team! Alex Spiedel, Organized Play Coordinator;\
  \ Jon Morgantini, Community &amp; Social Media Specialist; and Rue Dickey, Marketing\
  \ &amp; Media Specialist all report to me, but this group of adventurers needs more\
  \ than four. So, I regularly borrow the talents of Raychael Allor, our Licensing\
  \ &amp; Marketing Coordinator, and Maryssa Lagervall, our Web Content Manager, who\
  \ join us from the licensing and technology teams, respectively. Together we form\
  \ Volt—er, a skilled and dedicated group to help you play Starfinder and Pathfinder!</p>\
  \ \n     <p>As Director of Marketing, I lead our team of marketers in the creation\
  \ and execution of a strategic marketing plan to promote Paizo products. I understand\
  \ that there isn’t a single marketing program that’s 100% effective and am always\
  \ seeking to try out new things in a rapidly evolving world. (So. Much. Change.)</p>\
  \ \n     <p>But enough about me. I get to manage and work with United Paizo Workers.\
  \ Let’s talk about them!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/1721d61a-28ab-4adb-bc23-9ff8135cfb25/PZO7122_GM_TOOLS_2000.png\"\

  \ </div> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Alex Spiedel, Organized Play Coordinator (he/him)</h3>\
  \ \n     <p>Alex is responsible for the day-to-day administration of Paizo’s Organized\
  \ Play programs, including campaign management, volunteer relationships, communications,\
  \ and technical operations. He’s also in charge of all Organized Play activities\
  \ at conventions, from building and implementing con schedules to helping the on-site\
  \ events run smoothly. His passion for making Org Play the best it can be—and his\
  \ hunger for dice—knows no bounds.</p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Rue Dickey, Marketing\
  \ &amp; Media Specialist (he/they)</h3> \n     <p>Rue (they/he/xe) is a nonbinary,\
  \ mixed-Indigenous-Roma-Welsh, disabled creator living on unceded Kalapuya territory\
  \ with xir two spouses, tiny dog, and long noodle baby. Queer rage and joy in equal\
  \ parts are a focus of his design and they strive to create space at the table for\
  \ stories that the world has tried to keep quiet. They would like to make the world\
  \ just a little brighter—by bringing these stories into the spotlight. Rue spends\
  \ xir limited free time building outlandish costumes and is proud to be a never-recovering\
  \ circus goth.</p> \n     <p>Rue is the newest member of the marketing team! They’\
  re our liaison to external press and news media—coordinating interviews, previews,\
  \ and reviews to ensure that Paizo products get the recognition they deserve and\
  \ the coverage we need to continue to thrive. Behind the scenes, xe coordinates\
  \ the day-to-day marketing functions and makes sure everything goes smoothly.</p>\
  \ \n     <br> \n     <h3>Jon Morgantini, Community &amp; Social Media Specialist\
  \ (he/him)</h3> \n     <p>Jon is a Paizo brand ambassador. This is the most normal\
  \ job he’s ever had. He’s a 20-year military veteran of two services, has driven\
  \ limos for celebrities, and previously worked at a funeral home. As Community &amp;\
  \ Social Media Specialist, he now works his wizardry on social media, and he knows\
  \ what makes forums safe and fun to participate in. When not working, Jon can most\
  \ often be found reading dark fantasy or techno thrillers and getting lost in Hyrule.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Jon produces content across all Paizo social channels, but the whole\
  \ team of marketers spreads the word about the amazing Pathfinder and Starfinder\
  \ gaming products that we release each month. Steve, Jon’s WizKids Goblin roommate,\
  \ takes much of the credit.</p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Raychael Allor, Licensing\
  \ &amp; Marketing Coordinator (she/her)</h3> \n     <p>When not fulfilling her role\
  \ as an ever-tired cat mom, Raychael is involved in all of Paizo’s licensed partner\
  \ marketing efforts, from concepting new campaigns to implementing those plans at\
  \ conventions, across social media, and to the Paizo community. Her work with licensed\
  \ partners involves not only communication and coordination with a wide variety\
  \ of people from all over the world, but also interdepartmental coordination to\
  \ make sure everyone is on the same page, no matter the project.</p> \n     <p>In\
  \ short, Raychael is a vital member of the marketing and licensing teams and gets\
  \ the opportunity to work on a wide variety of exciting projects—and tell the world\
  \ about them!</p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Maryssa Mari, Web Content Manager (she/her)</h3>\
  \ \n     <p>Maryssa is officially part of the tech team. As Paizo’s Web Content\
  \ Manager, she reports to the Director of Technology and partners collaboratively\
  \ with teams across the company. She helps wrangle Paizo’s non-store online content,\
  \ web page design, and is Keeper Of The Blog Schedule™. Her job is to be aware of\
  \ the shenanigans Paizo gets up to online and provide assistance when needed.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>When she’s not being a <s>nuisance</s> valuable member of the company\
  \ chats, Maryssa enjoys hiking, crafting, 48-hour gaming marathons before forgetting\
  \ her steam library exists, and keeping upcoming spoilers from the hoard of roommates.</p>\

  \ \n     <br> \n     <p><b>In conclusion…</b><br> Our marketing+ team is a fun and\
  \ imaginative group made up of highly creative and smart people who are passionate\
  \ about the products we produce. Someone let them all into the same room and now\
  \ they scheme and create chaos together! They may or may not be half a dozen kobolds\
  \ and skittermanders in cloaks—we haven't been able to confirm—and some of them\
  \ escaped containment from other departments and won't leave ours. <s>Please send\
  \ help.</s> Please play with us!</p> \n     <p>Adventures ahead,</p> \n     <p style=\"\
