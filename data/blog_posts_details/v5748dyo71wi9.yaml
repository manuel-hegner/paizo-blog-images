  alt: "Ikeshti, artist David Franco; A small, red scaled bipedal lizard stands seriously\
    \ as they inspect a mechanical contraption in their hands—a tiny robot with three\
    \ visual sensors and four skittering insectile legs. There’s a scar over their\
    \ left eye and a longrifle stowed over their shoulder."

  alt: "Do’Trulu, artist Rustan Curman; A four-armed, muscular shobhad with gray skin,\
    \ protruding tusk-like lower canines, and a polished bone facemask towers over\
    \ 10 feet tall. They stand proud and confident in their carbon-scored armor, with\
    \ two hands each holding a miniature flaming doshko over a shoulder, and two hands\
    \ wielding a heavy crossbolter"
