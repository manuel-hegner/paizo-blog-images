  \    </div>\n     <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\">“Nahoa, can you\
  \ help me dig another ditch before planting season?”</p>\n      <p>“Nahoa, the pigs\
  \ have gotten out again—can you help me round them up?”</p>\n      <p>The Olehala\
  \ people, third of the four great nations of the Okaiyo Ocean, had many heroes.\
  \ Kolea the Wanderer, or Uncle Midnight, or the Tideweaver. But Nahoa’s village,\
  \ on a small island in the easternmost reaches of Olehala’s archipelago, had none.\
  \ It didn’t need any; the village had plentiful rain and bountiful harvests, the\
  \ seas were calm and the currents easy. But for whatever small problems might crop\
  \ up—a ripped sail here, a sick child in need of watching there—Nahoa was always\
  \ first to pitch in. The young man was no hero, but he worked hard on his family’\
  s taro farm, sharing whatever was left over with his neighbors, and he played harder,\
  \ stone-bowling with friends or lava-sledding down the slopes.</p>\n      <p>The\
  \ years were joyful. Planting and harvesting, watching his little sisters grow up.\
  \ The New Year’s games and feasts. Lazy summers swimming in the falls with that\
  \ navigator from the nearby Taotake islands, before she led her merchant canoes\
  \ east to distant Arcadia. For many years, all was well.</p>\n      <p>Until Pā\
  malō returned. The Olehala’s chants told of the demon, a massive creature of shadow\
  \ and smoke, its wings silent as an owl and its belly insatiable as a shark’s. Once\
  \ a generation, it would appear in the skies above their island, roost on the highest\
  \ mountain for one day and night, and then feed. As the creature alit and the skies\
  \ darkened, the people did what they had always done and hid: some in caves, some\
  \ in the forests, and some in the distant reefs. With luck, Pāmalō would take mostly\
  \ livestock, and leave.</p>\n      <p>Nahoa couldn’t understand. How could they\
  \ let this happen, generation after generation? The last time Pāmalō had come, Nahoa\
  \ had been too little to remember much, but the fear of black wings against the\
  \ sun had been seared in his mind, the same as everyone of the nameless, easternmost\
  \ island. Someone had to do something. His heart was telling Nahoa to do something.</p>\n\
  \      <p>No… it was Calling.</p>\n      <p>The Call had rung out for decades, and\
  \ whether the others could not hear it or could not answer, Nahoa did not know.\
  \ Without words, it implored someone to help. Nahoa was no hero… but he always helped\
  \ those in need, and so he did what he always did when asked to help.</p>\n    \
  \  <p>That night, Nahoa bathed in the waterfall and tidied the garden. He prepared\
  \ some of his sisters’ favorite food, leaving it near the cooking pit for them to\
  \ find in the morning, and he picked flowers to circle the stone that remembered\
  \ their mother and father. Lastly, he went to the path that led up the mountain,\
  \ digging stick in hand. Nahoa sat on a stump, the farming tool over his knee. <em>So\
  \ my sisters can grow up without fear</em>. He cut a notch into his digging stick.\
  \ <em>So Uncle doesn’t go hungry this winter</em>. Another notch. <em>So that nice\
  \ Taotake girl doesn’t encounter it on the seas</em>. With each reason to face the\
  \ creature, he cut. When he’d finished counting all his reasons, his digging stick\
  \ was a barbed spear. With it, he climbed the mountain to Pāmalō’s roost, and he\
  \ cried out a challenge as dawn broke.</p>\n      <p>Pāmalō paid no regard. Of course\
  \ it didn’t. It was ancient, the subject of songs and dances every young Olehalan\
  \ learned from their grandparents, its face carved into warding stones generations\
  \ ago. Nahoa was no hero. The creature snatched Nahoa in its talons, and the two\
  \ left the earth behind.</p>\n      <p>High in the sky, Nahoa fought Pāmalō. He\
  \ may as well have been an ant attempting to fight the tide, for all the difference\
  \ it seemed to make. Nahoa thrust his spear forward and it skittered along the demon\
  \ owl's slick, black feathers, to fall to the raging waves below; he seized its\
  \ wing to force it to earth but found it unyielding as a koa tree. He gave a great\
  \ shout and it looked back at him, at this insignificant thing that dared to fight\
  \ back, and it cocked its head. Nahoa didn’t even have time to let out a gasp as\
  \ his chest tore under its beak.</p>\n      <p>As pain filled him, Nahoa despaired—\
  was this all he really could do? He hadn’t expected to defeat Pāmalō, or even survive,\
  \ but he had hoped he might at least wound the creature, to buy a few years’ peace\
  \ for his island. To show his people that this ancient horror could bleed, that\
  \ it could be opposed, that it didn’t have to be accepted as the price for the turning\
  \ of the years. But it was for naught. Demonic shadows flooded into Nahoa’s chest\
  \ like a venom, and as Nahoa looked up at the sky above him, red filled his vision.</p>\n\

  \   </table>\n      <br>\n      <p>No, it didn’t. The sky above him was indeed red\
  \ as blood, but it was not Nahoa’s. In the distance, Nahoa saw an impossible vision\
  \ of two figures—a beast and a warrior as well—standing miles tall, bodies stretching\
  \ from below the horizon to above the sky. <em>The gods</em>, Nahoa thought in shock,\
  \ moments before one bisected the other, cutting immortality short. The heavens\
  \ wept as the divine blood of the warrior god rained through the sky in a shower\
  \ of sparks.</p>\n      <p>The sparks screamed past Nahoa and Pāmalō in streaks\
  \ of red and silver. One landed on Pāmalō’s wing, and in a rush of speed, the sea\
  \ below was replaced by the red desert of the distant mainland. Another landed,\
  \ and the desert was replaced by ocean anew, though a strange one, studded through\
  \ with the remnants of shattered land and ruined towers.</p>\n      <p>A spark screamed\
  \ through the air, shining with light, and its speed matched Pāmalō and Nahoa’s\
  \ as they flew. The demon tore into Nahoa once more, and Nahoa clung desperately\
  \ to consciousness as bone crunched. He looked to the spark. He had been Called\
  \ to protect his island, to face this beast, to <em>do something, anything</em>,\
  \ but intention was nothing without the power to see it through. Power that hung\
  \ in the air now, right before him. Nahoa reached for the spark with his right hand,\
  \ but Pāmalō held him in place. He reached again, and his flesh tore to beak and\
  \ talon. With a cry of pain, Nahoa reached a third time, and he seized divinity.</p>\n\
  \      <p>The spark flooded deep into Nahoa’s soul. He felt death flee from his\
  \ bones as divine power chased the shadows from his veins, burning them into his\
  \ skin as tattoos. His power, now, as well. Nahoa wrestled Pāmalō’s talons open,\
  \ finding them brittle in his grasp, and he reached out for a weapon, finding the\
  \ spear dropped half a world ago in his grip once more. As he yelled a challenge\
  \ anew to the creature that had terrorized his people, he felt the tiny spark of\
  \ divine power within him blaze, an ember fanned into a bonfire by this single moment\
  \ of glory. Nahoa thrust the spear deep into Pāmalō’s breast, and the might of gods\
  \ coursed down his arm and through the weapon to detonate in a peal of light and\
  \ thunder. As the demon’s torn body fell to earth, Nahoa fell with it, careening\
  \ toward a strange, icy shore.</p>\n      <p>Nahoa was no hero, not yet. But as\
  \ consciousness slipped from his grasp, the Calling rang out around him, clearer\
  \ than ever, and he knew it was what he was destined to be.</p>\n      <p style=\"\
