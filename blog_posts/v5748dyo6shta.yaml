  \    </div> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Our first project\
  \ of Pathfinder 2nd Edition—<a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shgc?Order-of-the-Amber-Die-The-Slithering-Salve\"\
  >The Slithering Salve</a>—is complete! That's right, last month we assembled the\
  \ Order for another marathon session of Ron Lundeen's module, <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq023hg?Pathfinder-Adventure-The-Slithering\"\
  ><em>The Slithering</em></a>. The August humidity in New Jersey was enough to curl\
  \ even the sturdiest character sheet, but we embraced it as part of our Mwangi experience\
  \ and came out alive (mostly, see below).</p> \n     <p>Once again, we pushed the\
  \ envelope of gaming immersion and paid homage to an adventure that boldly featured\
  \ so many oozes. Our five-gallon bucket of slime was ready at the table for anyone\
  \ who suffered a hit from an ooze; for each hit a character received, that player\
  \ had to stick their hand into the bucket and retrieve one of the dice that could\
  \ be found at the bottom. This is OAD after all, so this time we made it tougher\
  \ by cutting back on the number of dice in the bucket. How long it took you to find\
  \ one was what really defined the experience!</p> \n     <ul> \n      <li><b>Module</b>:\
  \ The Slithering</li> \n      <li><b>Marathon Length</b>: 60 hours, 15 minutes</li>\
  \ \n      <li><b>Session Hours</b>: 37 hours, 45 minutes</li> \n     </ul> \n  \
  \   <p>The Order has between 10 and 15 active members at any given time, and every\
  \ roster is unique to each project. As we mentioned before, the team for The Slithering\
  \ Salve differed from our other projects in that we had ages ranging from 47 to\
  \ 14, and experience varying from veterans with over 30 years' experience to a complete\
  \ newcomer to Pathfinder. We also ate well during this marathon, since cookies are\
  \ a meal when you're in the Order, and we had none other than Karee Vogrin of <a\
  \ href=\"https://criticalhitcookies.com/\">Critical Hit Cookies</a> returning as\
  \ Lini! Finally, our GM tapped three additional members for live NPC roles throughout\
  \ the adventure.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/1b3110fc-76b1-43e7-b68b-deabe160553f/092121_OotAD1.jpg\"\

  \  <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\"></p>\n     </div> \n     <h3>Highlights From <em>The\
  \ Slithering</em>:</h3> \n     <p>□ The journey to Holy Xatramba was more Mwangi\
  \ than we expected from this adventure—a welcome surprise. Our favorite encounter\
  \ of the trek was a 300-foot-long rope bridge that disappeared into the dense foliage,\
  \ and we didn't notice the trio of jungle drakes until one of them slammed down\
  \ behind Fumbus. It should probably be noted that the goblin was a couple hundred\
  \ feet ahead of the party. Time to burn those Hero Points, kid.</p> \n     <p>□\
  \ Kibwe had become a mess by the time we returned to try to rid the city of the\
  \ <em>slithering</em> curse. We watched as the owner of a semi-domesticated triceratops\
  \ melted into ooze, which slid down the side of the now-angry beast. As the dinosaur\
  \ rampaged toward the party, Lini and Korakai stood their ground, putting our hopes\
  \ on Wild Empathy and a <em>calm emotions</em> spell. The result of its Will save\
  \ vs. spell? Natural 1. </p> \n     <p>□ The Order always embraces a hearty PvP\
  \ bout when it's forced upon us. Heck, we even see it as a great opportunity for\
  \ some trash-talking around the table! When an encounter with two specters resulted\
  \ in our first PF 2.0 showdown between Jirelle and Zithembe (fighter), the bets\
  \ were placed and both players' best dice came out. Out of game, this was Auralee's\
  \ (Jirelle) first time playing Pathfinder, and she was up against Erick, a sixteen-year\
  \ veteran with more notches on his belt from dropping other players than anyone\
  \ in the Order. They went solid for seven rounds and it came down to the last hit,\
  \ but Erick defended his title. </p> \n     <p>□ Juno Reactor's \"Conga Fury\" blasted\
  \ away on the stereo during a couple of heated battles in this adventure, but it\
  \ wasn't louder than our GM when the Amber Die dropped yet another signature 20-20-20.\
  \ Adam always says afterwards: Still got it.</p> \n     <p>□ We continued to use\
  \ the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq024tn?Pathfinder-Critical-Hit-Deck\"\
  >Critical Hit Deck</a> and Critical Fumble Deck, with the deadly variant applied,\
  \ causing a card to be drawn on any crits (not just natural 20s). In total, we saw\
  \ a whopping 108 critical hits and 70 fumbles throughout the entire module. A few\
  \ of our favorites from the decks included Jirelle losing a thumb, suffering 3d6+2\
  \ persistent bleed damage in another battle, and also being stupefied, frightened,\
  \ and restrained from a set of nasty fumbles in a later fight. It went both ways\
  \ though, and we watched a jungle drake kill itself with its own stinger!</p> \n\

  \ \n     <p>We went into this adventure with the notion that it would be about things\
  \ that slithered; however, what made this project such a unique experience was not\
  \ the plethora of oozes we faced, but the epidemic-like experience that involved\
  \ the spread of the <em>slithering</em> curse itself. The curse was transmitted\
  \ through contact between creatures, and despite attempts to gather additional information,\
  \ we didn't know as much as we wanted to know about it. The only way to be truly\
  \ safe (until our heroes could end the curse) was to isolate and distance from others.\
  \ It was surreal returning to Kibwe near the end of the adventure to find the population\
  \ avoiding each other on the street, hiding in their homes, and wearing masks. You\
  \ can see where this is going; playing this module in 2020–2021 was an experience\
  \ we'll never forget—one that bonded us even more tightly as a gaming group. While\
  \ the Order has played over 150 modules, we can't understate what it felt like to\
  \ roleplay through this one. We found solace in our ability to end the spreading\
  \ curse, and just like the real-life events that surrounded this project, decades\
  \ from now the Order will still be talking about that time we played <em>The Slithering</em>.</p>\

  \ Deaths:</h3> \n     <p>Ron Lundeen has put plenty of our characters in the ground\
  \ <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgur?Order-of-the-Amber-DieThe-Azlant-Odyssey-Part-5\"\
  >over the years</a>, and he did it again here with a double-babau ambush that caught\
  \ us off guard. Skuulkush, our party's lizardfolk guide, bravely allowed himself\
  \ to be flanked in an effort to buy time. At least it was quick. </p> \n     <h3>Best\
  \ Quote from Marathon 2:</h3> \n     <p>(Fumbus returns out of breath after two\
  \ characters were lost scouting the ruins)</p> \n     <p>Lini: \"What happened?\
  \ What did you find?\"<br> Fumbus: \"Through those doors there is... a magical...\
  \ mind-controlling... DINOSAUR that takes your hands!\" </p> \n     <h3>Conclusion:</h3>\
  \ \n     <p>Escorting the ancient Pillar-Watcher known as Cursebreaker back to the\
  \ city of Kibwe (or simply chasing after it) was a mechanic that compounded the\
  \ sense of urgency we already felt throughout the adventure. We struggled to keep\
  \ up with the construct, driven by powerful magic, as it smashed its way through\
  \ the Aspis Consortium agents who tried to block its destination. We were fortunate\
  \ to have front-row seats when an alchemical golem also tried to stand in its way,\
  \ and the resulting melee was a fantastic primer for the final battle to come. In\
  \ the end, we managed to get the heavily damaged Pillar-Watcher back to the dais\
  \ where it belonged so that we could perform the ritual required to end the curse.\
  \ A win for Kibwe and the Order!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a\
