  \ in a new era of Pathfinder. Their nihilistic outlook and obsession with oblivion\

  \      <p><b>James Case</b><br> Hi! I’m James Case, editor à organized play developer\
  \ at Paizo. Gods and Magic was a lot of firsts for me—my first time as editing lead\
  \ on a project, as well as my first writing credit for Second Edition! I was happy\
  \ to contribute the section for my favorite hot mess / literal hurricane bird, Hei\
  \ Feng, as well as write (and copyfit ☹) the new domain spells. Eleanor and Luis\
  \ were even kind enough to let me pitch a couple new ones, letting me add my much-longed-for\
  \ star domain to the game. I tweet memes, Japanese music, RPG stuff sometimes I\
  \ guess, and also memes on The Twitters at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/toriariaria\"\

  \ everybody! My name is Katina Davis, and while I’ve been working at Paizo for nearly\
  \ 6 years now, I’ve only recently started dipping my toes into writing for our products.\
  \ I was absolutely tickled at the opportunity to write Shelyn’s section in Gods\
  \ &amp; Magic, because I have long identified with her values of art, beauty, and\
  \ love. I was a relative latecomer to RPGs when I first started playing Pathfinder\
  \ and I remember her making an impression on me. It’s been rewarding to be able\
  \ to dabble in the world of Second Edition from the ground floor, starting with\
  \ my favorite deity. In addition to writing for Pathfinder, Starfinder, and the\
  \ Pathfinder Adventure Card Game, I have also had the pleasure of working with Black\
  \ Book Editions to translate RPGs from French to English. Though I speak German\
  \ too, I have not yet had the opportunity to test my German RPG translation chops.\
  \ (I’d love to, though!) If you’re interested in seeing my full list of credits\
  \ or contacting me regarding freelance writing and translation, you can visit my\
  \ website: <a href=\"http://katinawritesstuff.com/\" target=\"_blank\">katinawritesstuff.com</a>.\
  \ </p> \n      <p><b>Joshua Grinlinton</b><br> I’ve been playing tabletop for well\
  \ over a decade. I got my proper start in 3.5e D&amp;D playing a Wizard (for better\
  \ or for worse), and immediately fell in love with the game. Since then, I’ve played\
  \ in a dozen different systems, run and played in a multitude of campaigns, and\
  \ have gotten deeply absorbed in writing new mechanics, classes, abilities, monsters,\
  \ and more! Magic in particular has always been a huge draw to me, so it was impossible\
  \ to pass up getting to write for 2e’s World Guide about Nethys, the ambitious man\
  \ who sought to master and understand all of magic, and wound up splintering his\
  \ mental faculties in the process. A dangerous endeavor, but a venture many mages\
  \ would undoubtedly find respectable. I tend to do animation, illustration, design,\
  \ and creative writing, and am available for freelance and contract work for all\
  \ of this and more. If interested in seeing more of my work and getting in contact\

  \ My name is Virginia Jordan, and I wrote nasty mosquito god, Glaundher. It’s always\
  \ so fun to write the grittier stuff from the Pathfinder universe, and I look forward\
  \ to getting to write more content to fill Golarion with. You can also find my other\
  \ writing for Paizo in Alien Archive 3 and Lost Omens: Absalom. While not centered\
  \ on writing, you can get in touch with me via my professional website, <a href=\"\

  \ \n      <p><b>Jason Keely</b><br> Eleanor and Luis approached me with the opportunity\
  \ to write up a couple of the minor Pathfinder gods that have a much a larger presence\
  \ in <i>Starfinder: Besmara, Brigh</i>, and <i>Casandalee</i>. (The latter two are\
  \ two-thirds of the Starfinder deity known as Triune.) While we know plenty about\
  \ Besmara and Brigh from past products, Casandalee—from the Iron Gods Adventure\
  \ Path—was only recently “canonized.” I was excited to pick through the last adventure\
  \ of that AP, “<a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy9au9?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-90-The-Divinity-Drive\"\
  ><i>The Divinity Drive</i></a>,” to see what kind of goddess Casandalee would become.\
  \ It turned out her personality and domains could be different depending on the\
  \ PCs’ actions! Luckily, Eleanor and Luis gave me a brief sketch of Casandalee’\
  s areas of concern, so it wasn’t difficult to realize how her faith would manifest\
  \ on Golarion. In addition to being the patron of artificial life, Casandalee wants\
  \ to help people understand and use advanced technology responsibly. Given that\
  \ there isn’t a ton of that in the wider world (so far), the majority of her priests\
  \ remain in Numeria. It was a ton of fun to write, and I hope we’ll eventually get\
  \ to see a couple of devotees of the Iron Goddess outside of the Broken Lands!</p>\

  \ I didn’t have a lot more words here to spin yarns about them, their plots, and\
  \ their relationships! Also, as the resident halfling expert, I was pleased to take\

  \ your divine magic from a whole family of related gods.<br> In addition to my work\
  \ for Paizo, I've currently got a series of undercity locations coming out from\
  \ 0one Games. Written for that other popular RPG, these ready-made adventure sites\
  \ can be used individually or combined together. Watch trailers for the first two\

  \ pathfinders! My name is Shahreena. Much of my writings and imaginations about\
  \ Pathfinder deities, their places of worship, and religious beliefs and practices\
  \ are based on observations and knowledge about various Asian and Arab cultures.\
  \ As an ethnologist, I am fascinated by communities of people and their cultural\
  \ practices, and frequently spend time observing and thinking about how they relate\
  \ with others. IRL, I teach courses in Modern Standard Arabic, and the literature\
  \ and cultures of the Arab and Islamic world at The Ohio State University. I am\
  \ passionate about (and give presentations on) providing equitable access, skills,\
  \ and support to young people from diverse and underrepresented backgrounds interested\
  \ in pursuing foreign language study abroad, and am excited about my upcoming 360\
  \ video recording project in May! I cannot wait to begin recording in different\
  \ cities of the Arab world and offer a virtual sense of cultural immersion to interested\
  \ learners. (To contact, support, and/or learn more about my projects, you can reach\
  \ me at: <a href=\",maitlto:shahreena_s@yahoo.com\">shahreena_s@yahoo.com</a> .)\
  \ <i>Inshallah</i> I’ll be back in time for Origins. Hope to see y’all there! O-H!</p>\
  \ \n      <p><b>Jason Tondro</b><br> I’m Jason Tondro and I'm a Starfinder developer;\
  \ I wrote the Outer Gods section of this book, which allowed me to explore what\
  \ I think is really scary about the Cthulhu Mythos: not that it’s gross and icky,\
  \ but that the universe Just Does Not Care About You. I’m also the author of <a\
  \ href=\"https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/232408/Arthur-Lives-for-Fate-Core\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Arthur Lives! for Fate Core</a>, and the editor of <a href=\"\

  \ target=\"_blank\">Peripheral Code</a>, a fanzine for the Ars Magica game. Follow\

  \ \n      <p><b>Diego Valdez</b><br> Hello everyone! I wrote the Empyreal Lords\
  \ and Alseta. The Empyreal Lords have long been my favorite part of the Golarion\
  \ cosmology. So being given the opportunity to write them was really awesome! Alseta\
  \ was also a really fun deity to write! I hope you all find both to be fun and flavorful\
  \ parts of your tables! Gods and Magic will be my first contributor credit in a\
  \ physical Pathfinder book, but it is not the first writing I have done for Paizo.\
  \ I have been invited to write 3 ACG scenarios. On the Starfinder end I contributed\
  \ to both <i>Alien Archive 3</i> and <i>Near Space</i>, I wrote a quest for Starfinder\
  \ Society, and I wrote an article for the backmatter of an upcoming Adventure Path.\
  \ For Pathfinder RPG, in addition to Gods and Magic, I have contributed the upcoming\
  \ City of Lost Omens Absalom book. Creative endeavors beyond that include a YouTube\
  \ channel I am working on getting off the ground (it’s still a work in progress).<br>\
