  alt: "On a bright, sunny day a Polynesian-inspired dinghy pulls up to an island\
    \ with a waterfall on the left and mountains in the distance. Behind the waterfall,\
    \ there's a subtle sillhouette of a woman. The ocean surrounding the island is\
    \ a comforting aqua blue. Taiwalei, a human Pathfinder, faces the viewer, excitedly\
    \ beckoning toward the island, smiling and eager for the adventure ahead"
