  \   </div> \n   <h1>Pathfinder Battles Preview: Rounding Out the Set!</h1> \n  \
  \ <p class=\"date\">Friday, December 2, 2011</p> \n   <p>The official release of\
  \ <a href=\"/store/byCompany/w/wizKids/featuredBrands/pathfinderMiniatures/v5748btpy8mq6\"\
  >Heroes &amp; Monsters</a>, our first <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids\"\
  >Pathfinder Battles</a> prepainted miniatures set, is approaching! Over the last\
  \ few months, I’ve used this weekly space to reveal sculpts and final images from\
  \ the set, and with this post, I will have revealed all but one of the miniatures\
  \ here on the blog! (You’ll have to wait for the Gargoyle, alas, as I forgot to\
  \ ask the art department to photograph him this week. Sorry!)</p> \n   <p>After\
  \ that, I’ll show off a few painted versions of figures we have only seen in sculpt\
  \ form, and after THAT I’ll begin showing off sculpts from the NEXT set, Rise of\
  \ the Runelords. I’m very pleased with what we’ve seen so far from <a href=\"/store/byCompany/w/wizKids/featuredBrands/pathfinderMiniatures/v5748btpy8mq6\"\
  >Heroes &amp; Monsters</a>, but holy moley, Rise of the Runelords takes things to\
  \ the next level. I can’t wait!</p> \n   <p>But that’s the future. Onward to today’\
  s previews!</p> \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/120212-Wolf_360.jpeg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/120212-Wolf_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n   </div>\
  \ \n   <p>First up we have the Wolf, a common miniature sculpted in a nice leaping\
  \ pose. Note the haunting red eyes and the nasty teeth! Aside from this being a\
  \ solid miniature of a wolf, I’m pleased to report that the paint scheme used on\
  \ its fur is identical to that used on the <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lcsa?Pathfinder-Battles-Preview-Spooky-Salutations\"\
  >Werewolf I previewed a few weeks ago</a>, making this a perfect choice for the\
  \ “wolf” version of that creature. Throw a pack of these bad boys at your party\
  \ and they’re sure to be barking at the moon!</p> \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n    <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/120212-Mummy_360.jpeg\"><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/120212-Mummy_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n   </div> \n   <p>Next up we’ve got the Mummy, an uncommon\
  \ undead menace lurching its way toward your campaign. When we originally added\
  \ the Mummy to this set, he was pegged to the “rare” rarity, but when the final\
  \ sculpt came in he struck me more as a “rank and file” Mummy than a super awesome\
  \ end-of-the-campaign undead overlord, so I busted him down to uncommon, making\
  \ it easier to rack up a few of these guys for a nice higher-level encounter. Some\
  \ day soon I hope to get that Mummy Overlord to make the perfect “captain” for a\
  \ squad of these guys, but in the time being I think this one packs a suitable punch.</p>\
  \ \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/120212-Chimera_360.jpeg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/120212-Chimera_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n  \
  \ </div> \n   <p>Next we have the Chimera, which I must confess has been one of\
  \ the most difficult and frustrating models in the entire set. Some of you may recall\
  \ a digital Chimera sculpt we released as part of our initial publicity push for\
  \ the line. We were never really satisfied with that sculpt. It wasn’t based on\
  \ Pathfinder art, and it just looked too cartoony and “not right,” no matter how\
  \ many times we modified it. Worse, it lacked a critical part of a Pathfinder Chimera’\
  s anatomy—wings. That was the death knell for that sculpt, but just when we thought\
  \ all was lost, WizKids came to the rescue! It turns out they weren’t satisfied\
  \ with the original look, either, so they green-lit a resculpt behind the scenes\
  \ to see if a different artist might be able to come closer to what we needed. The\
  \ final Chimera pictured here is the result of their effort, wings and all.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>So there you have it for today’s previews. I’m off to approve more amazing\
  \ sculpts from our next set, Rise of the Runelords!</p> \n   <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p>\
