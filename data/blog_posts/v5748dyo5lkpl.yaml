  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Between the devil-bound nation\
  \ of Cheliax and the storied realm of Varisia festers a land enveloped in gloom,\
  \ where 10,000 years of obeisance to a fell god have warped the people and landscape\
  \ into shadowy horrors beyond recognition.</p> \n     <p>Welcome, then, to Nidal.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>In <a href=\"/products/btpya0fg?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Nidal-Land-of-Shadows\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Nidal, Land of Shadows</em></a>, we draw back\
  \ the curtain for the first time on this theocracy dedicated to Zon-Kuthon, god\
  \ of darkness and pain.</p> \n     <p>The book includes a stunningly detailed look\
  \ into Nidalese history and daily life, both in the nation's oppressive cities and\
  \ in rural villages, where keeping the appearance of absolute dedication to the\
  \ Kuthite religion is a matter of life and death. This book also reveals new details\
  \ about how, 10,000 years ago, Nidal's leaders made the pact that placed the nation\
  \ in eternal servitude to the evil Midnight Lord. A gazetteer of the entire land,\
  \ detailed threats in the gloom, and a shudder-inducing bestiary round out this\
  \ book's offerings.</p> \n     <p>There's a lot to be proud of in this book, and\
  \ foremost on that list for me are the absolutely stellar authors on this project.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>I'm so pleased to say that all of the lore and gazetteer information\
  \ in <em>Nidal, Land of Shadows</em> was written by Liane Merciel, the author who\
  \ brought you the incredible novels <a href=\"/products/btpy8sa9?Pathfinder-Tales-Nightglass\"\
  ><em>Nightglass</em></a> and <a href=\"/products/btpy99k6?Pathfinder-Tales-Nightblade\"\
  ><em>Nightblade</em></a>. Those novels provided bone-chilling glimpses into the\
  \ stark wickedness of Kuthite life, and Liane did an incredible job building those\
  \ details into a rich, nuanced, and horrific world for Game Masters and players\
  \ to explore. Some of the most memorable creatures and set pieces from the novels—\
  Joyful Things, anyone?—are now fully integrated into the Pathfinder RPG.</p> \n\
  \     <p>Continuing the list of first-rate authors, the book's foreboding adventure\
  \ sites were written by none other than Lyz Liddell, a Paizo editor who is as conscientious\
  \ and thoughtful a writer as she is incisive and affecting. Lyz did a great job\
  \ creating and expanding locations that range from an underground hub of Desnan\
  \ resistance to a stronghold of rogue kytons to a certain tower where a tapestry\
  \ of living flesh is not the most horrifying thing inside.</p> \n     <p>In the\
  \ book's bestiary, our author list continues to shine. For this stark task, we pulled\
  \ on board Ron Lundeen and Mark Moreland, two of Paizo's own developers. Mark's\
  \ work, in truly fine form, includes the monster write-up for the Joyful Thing mentioned\
  \ above, and I think it turned out spectacularly creepy and atmospheric. Additionally,\
  \ I'm so pleased to say that Ron, whose new monsters in this book include a gristly\
  \ new kyton, joined our team in the office shortly after completing this assignment—\
  one of many reasons why this book is quite special.</p> \n     <p>There's so much\
  \ to say about <a href=\"/products/btpya0fg?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Nidal-Land-of-Shadows\"\
  ><em>Nidal, Land of Shadows</em></a> that I'm going to leave further discussion\
  \ of it for another blog. For now, take a look at this beautiful opening piece from\
  \ the second chapter!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderCampaignSetting/PZO92108-Opener.jpg\"\
