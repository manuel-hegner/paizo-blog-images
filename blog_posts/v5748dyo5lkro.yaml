  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">In <b><a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkqz?Whats-Your-Weapon\"\
  >Monday's blog</a>,</b> we talked about weapons and all the plentiful options you\
  \ have when you're picking those. So let's stay in the Equipment chapter for the\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpya0ae?Pathfinder-Playtest-Rulebook-Hardcover\"><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Playtest Rulebook</em></a> and take a look at armor, other gear, and everything\
  \ else having to do with items!</p> \n    <h2>Don Your Armor!</h2> \n    <p>Armor's\
  \ job is to protect you from your enemies' attacks. Your character can have proficiency\
  \ in light armor, medium armor, or heavy armor (or, in some cases, none of the above).\
  \ Most classes are only trained in their armor at first, though some martial classes\
  \ gain better proficiency at higher levels. In Pathfinder First Edition, many types\
  \ of armor were effectively obsolete because you could just buy a better type, but\
  \ for Pathfinder Second Edition, we've made a few new adjustments to make each type\
  \ a little different.</p> \n    <p>A suit of armor has many of the same statistics\
  \ as in Pathfinder First Edition, but now each one also gives a bonus to your TAC\
  \ (Touch Armor Class). For instance, studded leather gives a +2 item bonus to AC\
  \ and +0 to TAC, whereas a chain shirt gives a +2 item bonus to AC and +1 to TAC,\
  \ but it is heavier and noisier. That last bit comes from the noisy trait, one of\
  \ a small number of traits some armors have to reflect their construction and effect\
  \ on the wearer. Armor also has a Dexterity modifier cap (which limits how much\
  \ of your Dexterity modifier can apply to your AC); a check penalty that applies\
  \ to most of your Strength-, Dexterity-, and Constitution-based skill checks; a\
  \ penalty to your Speed; and a Bulk value. You'll balance these variables to pick\
  \ the armor that's best for you.</p> \n    <p>As you adventure, you'll find or craft\
  \ magic armor. Weapons and suits of armor alike can be enhanced with magical potency\
  \ runes. For weapons, a potency rune gives an item bonus on attack rolls and increases\
  \ the number of damage dice you roll on attacks with the weapon. For armor, the\
  \ potency rune increases the armor's item bonuses to your AC and TAC and gives you\
  \ a bonus to your saving throws! For instance, studded leather with a <i>+3 armor\
  \ potency rune</i> (a.k.a. <i>+3 studded leather</i>) would give you +5 AC, +3 TAC,\
  \ and +3 to your saves. You can also upgrade the potency later, etching a <i>+4\
  \ armor potency rune</i> onto that armor to increase its bonus. You can even upgrade\
  \ the potency of specific armor (and weapons) so you can hold on to your <i>celestial\
  \ armor</i> at higher levels. If you don't wear armor, not to worry! Your <i>bracers\
  \ of armor</i> give you a bonus to AC, TAC, and your saves without requiring you\
  \ to clad yourself in a clunky metal box. They might not protect you quite as well,\
  \ but maybe that trade-off is worth it to your wizard or monk!</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  > \n     <p><i>Illustrations by Wayne Reynolds</i></p>\n    </div> \n    <h2>Shield\
  \ Yourself!</h2> \n    <p>You've probably seen mention of shields in previous blogs,\
  \ announcements, and broadcast play sessions. To gain the benefits of a shield,\
  \ you have to spend an action to raise it, which then gives you a bonus to AC and\
  \ TAC (+1 for a light shield or +2 for a heavy shield) for 1 round. Your character\
  \ has proficiency in shields just like she does with armor, and when using a shield,\
  \ you use the lower proficiency rank of your armor or shield to calculate your Armor\
  \ Class.</p> \n    <p>Shields don't have potency runes. Instead, you might pick\
  \ up a shield made of a durable material like adamantine or craft a magic shield\
  \ that catches arrows, reflects a spell back at its caster, or bites your enemies!</p>\
  \ \n    <h2>Fill Your Backpack!</h2> \n    <p>The Equipment chapter also includes\
  \ all sorts of other gear you might want on adventures, from rope to tents to musical\
  \ instruments to religious symbols. Many of these items are required to perform\
  \ certain tasks, like thieves' tools. The new system of item quality makes it pretty\
  \ straightforward to figure out how tools work. For example, you need thieves' tools\
  \ to pick a lock or disable many traps. Normal thieves' tools let you do this normally,\
  \ expert-quality tools give you a +1 item bonus on your check, and master-quality\
  \ tools give you a +2 item bonus on your check. Now what if you get stuck without\
  \ your tools and need to improvise? Well, if you can scrabble something together,\
  \ you've created a poor-quality set of tools, which gives you a -2 item penalty\
  \ (much like the penalty for having an proficiency rank of untrained in a task).\
  \ The same thing might happen if you had to turn vines into improvised rope or use\
  \ an empty chest as a drum for an improvised musical instrument!</p> \n    <h2>Take\
  \ a Load Off!</h2> \n    <p>Not everything you can purchase is adventuring gear.\
  \ Cinco de Cuatro wouldn't be complete without some luxuries like a bottle of fine\
  \ wine or renting an extravagant suite! You might even rent an animal to ride about\
  \ town. Of course, an extravagant lifestyle can have a high cost, and the chapter\
  \ includes costs of living per week, month, or year so you can accurately budget\
  \ your lifestyle decisions.</p> \n    <h2>Switch It Up!</h2> \n    <p>One of the\
  \ squidgy parts of Pathfinder First Edition we wanted to clear up with the redesign\
  \ is how holding, wielding, and stowing items work, particularly switching how many\
  \ hands you're using for an item. Now, drawing an item from a pouch, changing your\
  \ grip from one-handed to two-handed, or detaching a shield from your arm all require\
  \ the Interact action. We've codified the rules for many of the basic things you\
  \ do with items so the other rules interface with them cleanly. That <b>[[A]]</b>\
  \ code you see there indicates this is an action, and will be a lovely icon in the\
  \ final rulebook!</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <h2>[[A]] Interact</h2> \n     <h3>Manipulate</h3>\
  \ \n     <p>You use your hand or hands to manipulate an object or the terrain. You\
  \ grab an unattended or stored object, open a door, or do some similar action. You\
  \ may have to attempt a skill check to determine if your Interact action was successful.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The equipment chapter also covers the full rules on item quality and\
  \ on Bulk, plus a section on how items and Bulk work for creatures of different\
  \ sizes.</p> \n     <p>Now you have a basic rundown of the gear in this book. We'll\
  \ dive deep into magic items at a later date. Looking at what you see here, what\
  \ sort of useful, peculiar, or silly things do you think your character will spend\
  \ their silver pieces on?</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Logan Bonner<br> <i>Designer</i></p>\
