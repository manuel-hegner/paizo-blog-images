  \      <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\"></p> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Ever\
  \ since we announced the Pathfinder Remaster project, my inbox has not known peace.\
  \ Every day I get asked by the Pathfinders worldwide, “how will Pathfinder Society\
  \ handle the Remaster?” Every day I must give the same answer, “I don’t know yet!\
  \ Ask me in 1d4 months!”</p> \n      <p>It’s now 1d4 months later and I can finally\
  \ start to answer this question! With the assistance of some incredibly dedicated\
  \ Additional Resources volunteers and no less than six members of Paizo staff, we\
  \ are here today to present the broad strokes of our plan to convert (or not convert)\
  \ your Pathfinder Society characters to the brand-new Remastered rules. While we\
  \ don’t intend for our scenarios to be written using the Remastered rules until\
  \ Year 6 begins at Gen Con 2024, we know the characters will need to make the switch\
  \ faster.</p> \n      <p>Before we get into it, I’d like to offer a couple of disclaimers.\
  \ First, the rules we’re sharing today are the broad strokes. There will be more\
  \ specifics to come on release date, but we’re still working our way through specific\
  \ questions like “what happens to my <em>staff of transmutation</em> now that transmutation\
  \ isn’t a school?” We’re sharing this today to get you ready for what’s to come.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Second, these rules are still in flux. We have a pile of questions\
  \ yet to answer internally (we’re having weekly meetings to do nothing but answer\
  \ them), and we expect more will come from the community as time goes on. We expect\
  \ this to happen! Our intention is for these guidelines to live in a subpage of\
  \ the Guide to Organized Play, to allow them to be a living document we’ll update\
  \ as time goes on.</p> \n      <p>Finally, we will not be able to answer every single\
  \ question that comes up. Rules discrepancies and questions come up <em>all the\
  \ time</em> at tables, and the Remaster will increase the odds of that happening.\
  \ The GM always has the power to make calls on rules questions at the table. While\
  \ we strive for the Pathfinder Society experience to play out the same at every\
  \ table worldwide, we need to accept as a community that there will be some variance,\
  \ and be patient with each other as we figure things out. This is a game, we’re\
  \ here to have fun, let’s all keep that in mind as we play!</p> \n      <p>With\
  \ all that out of the way, here are the current planned guidelines for Pathfinder\
  \ Society and the Remaster. If you have questions/comments/concerns, drop them in\
  \ the comments of this blog and we’ll do our best to answer them. Once the Remaster\
  \ drops, we’ll create a separate thread in the Pathfinder Society forum for those\
  \ specific rules interactions that we won’t discover until they come up in play.</p>\

  \      <center>\n       <hr width=\"75%\">\n      </center> \n      <h2>Objectives</h2>\
  \ \n      <p>When considering the Pathfinder Remaster, our intent is as follows:</p>\
  \ \n      <ul> \n       <li>To ensure that players are not forced to rebuild characters</li>\
  \ \n       <li>To ensure that as much previous material as feasible is still useable</li>\
  \ \n       <li>To incentivize adoption of the new, Remastered ruleset</li> \n  \
  \     <li>To provide an optional method to rebuild characters into Remaster rules</li>\
  \ \n      </ul> \n      <br> \n      <h2>General Guidance</h2> \n      <ol> \n \
  \      <li><strong>Game Rules</strong></li> \n       <ol> \n        <li>Players\
  \ and GMs must use the remastered rules of the game immediately where possible.</li>\
  \ \n        <ol> \n         <li><strong>Example</strong>: Recall Knowledge has been\
  \ updated with additional guidelines. These take effect immediately at all PFS tables.</li>\
  \ \n         <li><strong>Example: </strong>The Refocus activity and the focus spell\
  \ rules have been updated to be more intuitive. All characters immediately begin\
  \ using these rules.</li> \n         <li><strong>Example: </strong>Monster abilities\
  \ such as Grab are no longer automatic, but allow a free skill check to attempt\
  \ the action. GMs immediately begin using this new version of the rules.</li> \n\
  \        </ol> \n       </ol> \n       <li><strong>Character Options</strong></li>\
  \ \n       <ol> \n        <li>Beginning on November 15, 2023, no new characters\
  \ may be created using the class chassis printed in the <em>Core Rulebook</em> if\
  \ the class has been reprinted in the <em>Player Core</em>.</li> \n        <ol>\
  \ \n         <li>This affects the following classes: bard, cleric, druid, fighter,\
  \ ranger, rogue, witch, wizard.</li> \n         <li>Characters with at least 1 game\
  \ reported prior to November 15 may be built using the <em>Core Rulebook</em> chassis.</li>\
  \ \n         <li>Previously-existing characters with at least 1 game reported may\
  \ continue their progression using the <em>Core Rulebook</em> chassis. They may\
  \ not use the chassis in the <em>Player Core</em> without rebuilding.</li> \n  \
  \      </ol> \n        <li>If a character option has been reprinted with the same\
  \ name, use the new version as if it were errata. No additional retraining is necessary.</li>\
  \ \n        <ol> \n         <li><strong>Example</strong>: <em>divine lance</em>\
  \ has been reprinted with new Remaster-compatible rules. All PCs with <em>divine\
  \ lance</em> must update the spell accordingly.</li> \n        </ol> \n        <li>If\
  \ a character option has not been reprinted, characters are free to use the option\
  \ as previously printed, or to select it at any time.</li> \n        <ol> \n   \
  \      <li><strong>Example</strong>: the <em>brooch of shielding</em> has not been\
  \ reprinted. Characters may still purchase and use a <em>brooch of shielding</em>.</li>\
  \ \n         <li><strong>Example</strong>: the <em>produce flame</em> spell has\
  \ not been reprinted, but <em>ignition</em> takes its place thematically. Characters\
  \ may learn either spell anytime they would learn a new spell, and could learn both\
  \ spells if they chose.</li> \n         <li><strong>Example</strong>: the oracle\
  \ class has not yet been remastered. Players may still build and play oracles using\
  \ the rules in the <em>Pathfinder Advanced Player’s Guide</em>.</li> \n        </ol>\
  \ \n       </ol> \n      </ol> \n      <ol> \n       <li>An oracle who learns <em>divine\
  \ lance</em> must still use the remastered version of the spell.</li> \n      </ol>\
  \ \n      <br> \n      <h2>Specific Rules</h2> \n      <ol> \n       <li><strong>Alignment:\
  \ </strong>Alignment has been removed from the game. PCs and NPCs no longer have\
  \ alignment.</li> \n       <ol> \n        <li><strong>Edicts and Anathema</strong>:\
  \ To replace certain aspects of alignment, edicts and anathema are being emphasized.\
  \ These are voluntary and optional, though deities and classes may introduce specific\
  \ edicts and anathema which are not optional.</li> \n        <li><strong>Holy and\
  \ Unholy</strong>: Many previously-aligned options now have either the holy, unholy,\
  \ or sanctified traits. At a GM’s discretion, enemy abilities which previously had\
  \ the good or evil traits may now have the holy or unholy trait.</li> \n       \
  \ <ol> \n         <li><strong>Example: </strong>A quasit’s strikes previously had\
  \ the evil trait. A GM may choose to give them the unholy trait, as quasits are\
  \ demonic creatures. Similarly, a quasit’s weakness to good should now be considered\
  \ a weakness to holy.</li> \n        </ol> \n       </ol> \n       <li><strong>Wizards</strong></li>\
  \ \n       <ol> \n        <li>Wizards built using the <em>Core Rulebook</em> chassis\
  \ may continue to treat spells that had their spell school removed as part of the\
  \ Remaster as if they have spell schools. They must otherwise fully update their\
  \ remastered spells.</li> \n        <ol> \n         <li><strong>Example: </strong>An\
  \ evocation wizard may still select <em>electric arc</em> as an evocation cantrip.\
  \ They must use the new damage as printed in the <em>Player Core</em>.</li> \n \
  \       </ol> \n        <li>Wizards built using the <em>Core Rulebook</em> chassis\
  \ may learn new spells printed in remastered books, but they can never treat them\
  \ as having a school spell if they did not previously have one.</li> \n        <li>Runelords</li>\
  \ \n        <ol> \n         <li>On November 15, 2023, the Runelord boon will be\
  \ removed from the Achievement Points store. No new Runelords may be created after\
  \ this date until/unless the archetype is reprinted.</li> \n        </ol> \n   \
  \    </ol> \n       <li><strong>Campaign-Specific Rules and Clarifications</strong></li>\
  \ \n       <ol> \n        <li>Pathfinder Society characters may not be sanctified\
  \ to unholy. This is the spiritual successor to the previous rule forbidding PCs\
  \ of evil alignment.</li> \n       </ol> \n      </ol> \n      <br> \n      <h2>Rebuilding</h2>\
  \ \n      <ol> \n       <li>On November 15, 2023, all characters with at least one\
  \ game reported are granted one free rebuild. This is a full rebuild; you may completely\
  \ alter a character’s ancestry, class, background, and any options selected. You\
  \ may not alter the adventures a character has participated in, nor may you alter\
  \ a character’s Reputation earned.</li> \n       <li>Upon rebuilding, your character\
  \ starts with gold equal to <u>Table X.X</u><em>[Alex note: this table will be published\
  \ with the full rules, and is built on our baseline assumption of earning 8 TB per\
  \ scenario]</em>.</li> \n       <ol> \n        <li>Alternatively, a player character\
  \ may sell any and all currently-held items at face value and purchase new items\
  \ as normal.</li> \n       </ol> \n       <li>If you use this rebuild, indicate\
  \ “Remaster Rebuild” on your character’s most recent Chronicle Sheet.</li> \n  \
  \     <li>If, in the course of this rebuild, you wish to refund any purchased boons,\
  \ please email orgplayreportingerrors[at]paizo[dot]com with your character’s name,\
  \ OP ID and character number, and the boon(s) you would like to refund.</li> \n\
  \       <li>This rebuild must be used before December 31, 2024. A second rebuild\
  \ of this type will not be granted following the release of Player Core 2.</li>\
  \ \n      </ol> \n      <br> \n      <center>\n       <hr width=\"70%\">\n     \
  \ </center> \n      <br> \n      <h2>One Final Change</h2> \n      <p>While this\
  \ isn’t a direct result of the Remaster, we’re taking the opportunity to make another\
  \ change. Beginning on November 15, we will be <strong>removing the Pathfinder Training</strong>\
  \ from the Guide to Organized Play. Your characters who are already Field Commissioned\
  \ may still take bonus downtime, and we’re not going to take away the bonus Lores\
  \ or feats your characters may have already gained. However, new characters may\
  \ not use this system. Quite simply, it’s an extra layer of complexity that most\
  \ players aren’t engaging with, and that doesn’t add much to the program.</p> \n\
  \      <p>However, we know everybody <em>loves</em> free items, so they will remain\
  \ in the form of <strong>Pathfinder Provisions</strong>! We’ll have a pared-down\
  \ list of consumables which all agents (including formerly Field Commissioned agents)\
  \ may choose from at the start of a mission. By default agents will receive healing\
  \ potions, though they may choose another item or items if they prefer. The Society\
  \ wants to ensure its agents come home safe!</p> \n     </blockquote> \n    </div>\
