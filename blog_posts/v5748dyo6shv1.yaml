  \    </div> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">They all agreed\
  \ that it was Ak’s fault. Poog, Reta Bigbad, Mogmurch, Chuffy Lickwound, even Mogmurch’\
  s toad Amfibier agreed—in a gravelly voice that sounded nothing at all like Mogmurch\
  \ muttering through closed lips. Ak had been the first to climb into the back of\
  \ the wagon, and so the other four goblins had no choice but to follow him, only\
  \ to become trapped when the longshanks and his two terrible horses had arrived,\
  \ forcing them to cower under a tarpaulin as the wagon rolled into... a human village?\
  \ The sounds and smells were inconclusive. </p> \n     <p>“Didn’t want to,” Ak said\
  \ mournfully. “Reta said she would bash me if didn’t.”</p> \n     <p>Reta smacked\
  \ the other goblin hard across the back of the head. “Was a test!” she snapped.\
  \ “You coward enough to go just because I tell you? Weak, Ak. We all <em>very</em>\
  \ disappointed.”</p> \n     <p>The other three goblins, and Amfibier, all muttered\
  \ in agreement. It was not the first time Ak had disappointed them all, and it would\
  \ surely not be the last. After a few moments, the muttering trailed off into awkward\
  \ silence.</p> \n     <p>“What do we do now?” Mogmurch said in a harsh whisper.\
  \ “Longshanks gone. Don’t hear horses. Maybe it’s safe outside, maybe good time\
  \ to flee.”</p> \n     <p>“Yes, maybe,” said Reta. “Ak. You go outside, check and\
  \ see if it’s safe to come out.”</p> \n     <p>Ak looked warily into his companion’\
  s faces, his eyes narrowed. “This also a test? If I go outside, I fail again, Reta\
  \ hit me?”</p> \n     <p>“No,” Chuffy responded. He pulled a jagged, filthy blade\
  \ from a sheath at his belt that looked like it was held together with tar, leather\
  \ straps, and spite. “You stay in here, I stabs you. Go check now. If anything kills\
  \ you, make lots of noise, so we know not safe to come out yet.”</p> \n     <p>Ak’\
  s head cautiously emerged from under one corner of the canvas drop cloth, almost\
  \ immediately followed by the rest of his body as someone behind him delivered a\
  \ swift kick to his backside. The goblin landed in a heap, glancing furtively around\
  \ as he took in his surroundings. They were in what appeared to be a dimly lit barn.\
  \ No longshanks (or worse, horses) were in sight, but there were two more wagons,\
  \ one to either side. Someone had pulled back the canvas covering the nearest wagon,\
  \ revealing a rack of colorful kites and an opened crate. The crate was packed with\
  \ straw to protect its contents, but Ak could see enough to immediately recognize\
  \ what it contained.</p> \n     <p>The goblin’s beady red eyes went wide. He clambered\
  \ up and into the wagon, thrust his hand into the crate, and pulled out a decorated\
  \ red paper tube about the length of his arm, attached to a long stick and trailing\
  \ a short length of fuse. <em>Fireworks!</em> The best kind of fire! And fire was\
  \ already the best kind of almost anything. A slow smile spread across Ak’s face,\
  \ taking several seconds to traverse the distance from one ear to the other. This\
  \ was going to change everything. Once they saw what he’d found, his companions\
  \ were sure to be so grateful that...</p> \n     <p>“Stupid!” someone yelled from\
  \ the other wagon. “You dead yet? Or it safe to come out?”</p> \n     <p>Ak looked\
  \ down at the rocket in his hand, his toothy grin somehow growing even wider. “\
  Just moment,” he said “Found something! You wait there, I show you!” His other hand\
  \ went to the pouch at his belt, which contained a cache of special ingredients\
  \ belonging to Mogmurch—ingredients so volatile and dangerous that his alchemist\
  \ companion had insisted that only Ak could be trusted to carry them—and drew out\
  \ a single tindertwig. He struck the twig against the rough surface of the canvas,\
  \ lit the fuse, waited for a tense moment, grew tired of waiting, and jammed the\
  \ burning twig into the back of the rocket. There was a blinding flash, a deafening\
  \ report, and Ak was knocked flat on his back. Somewhere nearby, he could dimly\
  \ make out the unmistakable sound of goblins suffering painful burns, followed by\
  \ muffled cursing and scrabbling as his companions vacated their hiding place, which\
  \ quickly gave way to shouts of excitement as they spotted Ak’s discovery.</p> \n\
  \     <p>His senses were still clearing when Reta grabbed him by the throat and\
  \ hauled him to his feet. “Ak,” she said through gritted teeth, staring into his\
  \ eyes as they struggled to focus. “You try to kill us. With firework.” She motioned\
  \ to the gently smoldering wagon behind them, then to the other goblins greedily\
  \ rifling through the opened crate. “But. You also find us many, many firework.\
  \ You are forgiven, Ak. Today... today you are one of us.”</p> \n     <p>A single\
  \ tear of pure joy ran down Ak’s cheek. “R-really?” he whispered.</p> \n     <p>Reta\
  \ smiled, her mouth bristling with needle-sharp teeth. “No,” she said. “Not really.”\
  \ She gave him a hard push, and Ak topped backwards over the edge of the wagon.\
  \ Before he could hit the ground, the rocket that Chuffy had stuffed down the back\
  \ of his leather jerkin went off, propelling him across the warehouse and into the\
  \ darkness of the hayloft overhead with a strangled yelp and a gout of colorful\
  \ flame.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/1cd4b0da-699f-40b7-bf08-f289d5a5fc37/PZO5503_GoblinFireworkFight.png\"\

  >Goblin Firework Fight</a></h3>\n     </div> \n     <br> \n     <p>Behind Reta,\
  \ Poog and Mogmurch were busily pulling more fireworks out of the crate. “Smoke\
  \ bomb,” Mogmurch said, lighting the fuse of a wrapped paper bundle and tossing\
  \ it aside with an exasperated sigh. “Not explode. Not start fire. No point.” Poog\
  \ nodded in agreement, holding the end of another lit tindertwig to the fuse of\
  \ a bright purple rocket, then deftly spinning the rocket around to use its fuse\
  \ to light another, even larger, green rocket. He was still clutching both when\
  \ the door flew open at the other end of the barn.</p> \n     <p>“Who’s in here?”\
  \ bellowed a tall figure, silhouetted against the light streaming in from outside\
  \ the barn. The goblins froze. A second shadow, four-legged, growled deep in its\
  \ throat and stalked ahead of its master into the barn.</p> \n     <p>Poog panicked.\
  \ Immediately. “DOG!” he shrieked, lowering the green rocket so that it pointed\
  \ at the oncoming animal a split second before it went off. The rocket missed the\
  \ dog by more than a goblin’s full height and shot directly out the open entryway,\
  \ where it struck the inner wall of a stable next door and ricocheted wildly from\
  \ stall to stall, trailing a shower of sparks. A moment later, the purple rocket\
  \ in Poog’s other hand went off, striking Mogmurch squarely in the face. The other\
  \ goblin’s skull-faced helmet flew off as he toppled backward into the crate, followed\
  \ by the sparking purple rocket. The straw cushioned his impact for a brief moment\
  \ before bursting into flames.</p> \n     <p>“GOBLINS!” the longshanks in the doorway\
  \ yelled, taking a step back as the dog, followed by two others, charged snarling\
  \ into the barn. Poog shrieked in terror and leaped from the wagon, scampering across\
  \ the cluttered floor and clambering up the assortment of riding tack that hung\
  \ on one wall of the barn, with Reta right on his heels. There was a tremendous\
  \ crack, and a blast of heat and smoke washed over them as the wagon below erupted\
  \ in a massive storm of shrieking multicolored fireballs. One of the fireballs,\
  \ shrieking slightly louder than the others, darted across the floor and up a rickety\
  \ ladder toward the hayloft. </p> \n     <p>“That way!” Reta snarled at Poog, gesturing\
  \ toward the loft as she began to swing, hand over hand, across the wall of saddles\
  \ and wagon wheels. Below, the dogs barked in rage and confusion as something else\
  \ caught fire with a satisfying <em>whoosh</em>. There were more longshanks outside\
  \ now; she could hear them. More dogs, too.</p> \n     <p>In the loft they found\
  \ Mogmurch, still smoking but no longer actually aflame, peering out a small window\
  \ that opened out over the street. A moment later, Chuffy hauled himself up and\
  \ over the ledge, blade clenched between his teeth. He scowled down at Ak, whose\
  \ unconscious body was still sprawled face down on the floor where he had landed\
  \ at the end of his brief flight. “Stupid Ak,” he said, delivering a scornful kick\
  \ that elicited a weak moan. “Mess everything up for us. Again. Now we stuck up\
  \ here, probably die.”</p> \n     <p>“Yeah, not look good,” Mogmurch said. “Longshanks\
  \ busy trying to put out stable fire. Way too many dogs outside, though. Maybe we\
  \ throw Ak down, run away while they eat him?”</p> \n     <p>There was a moment\
  \ of silent contemplation as each goblin briefly considered who they might be able\
  \ to bully into dragging Ak to the window. Outside, a panicked human voice screamed,\
  \ “It’s spreading! Dawnflower’s grace, stop it before it reaches the alchemist!”\
  </p> \n     <p>Poog broke the silence, chuckling knowingly as he put his arms around\
  \ his companions’ shoulders.</p> \n     <p>“Friends, friends,” Poog said, closing\
  \ his eyes and shaking his head softly from side to side. “You really think Poog\
  \ not have brilliant escape plan for just this moment? You forget why we call Poog\
  \ the smart one?” Sliding one hand into his belt pouch, he withdrew the item inside\
  \ with a flourish, grinning widely as he looked around for approval.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>Reta was not impressed. “Yes,” she said. “We all have fingers, Poog. Finger\
  \ not what we need right now, Poog.”</p> \n     <p>Poog glanced down at the mummified\
  \ digit in his hand, scowling, and tossed it away before quickly withdrawing a second\
  \ item, which he dutifully examined before displaying it to the others. “Not that.\
  \ Have lots of things in here.” He took the rough wooden whistle in his hand and\
  \ put it to his lips, then blew silently.</p> \n     <p>A tense moment passed.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“It broken?” Chuffy started to ask. He was interrupted as a grand commotion\
  \ erupted somewhere outside. Something large skidded across the cobblestone street\
  \ and crashed into something else with a dull thud. A chorus of canine yips broke\
  \ out, only to be drowned out by a furious bellow that trailed off into a high-pitched\
  \ squeal of rage. The five goblins crowded to the window.</p> \n     <p>“SQUEALY\
  \ NORD!”</p> \n     <p>A huge pig was charging haphazardly through the crowd, scattering\
  \ longshanks and dogs alike. As the last of the dogs turned tail and fled, the pig\
  \ positioned itself in the street directly below the window, looking up at them\
  \ expectantly. They jumped as one, pouring out of the window just as the hayloft\
  \ went up in flames behind them. Poog wrapped his arms around Squealy Nord’s neck\
  \ and prodded him gently on one flank. “Run, Squealy Nord!” he shouted. “Run like\
  \ wind!”</p> \n     <p>They met with little resistance as Squealy Nord raced up\
  \ the road leading out of town, bellowing, snorting, and squealing in equal measure;\
  \ the dogs had scattered, and the longshanks, easily distracted, were busy attempting\
  \ to extinguish the flames. About a quarter mile outside the village walls, the\
  \ great swine slowed to a trot, and the goblins allowed themselves a moment to cautiously\
  \ look back. Sure enough, no one had followed them. Also, Poog was missing. </p>\
  \ \n     <p>“Reta,” Mogmurch said. “Poog fall off. We go back, get him?”</p> \n\
  \     <p>Even at that distance, they all felt the shockwave from the massive blast\
  \ that came next. There was a deep, shuddering boom, and a colorful cloud in the\
  \ shape of a flower bloomed over the village, mingling with the thick cloud of black\
  \ smoke already spreading over the countryside. On the wind, they could hear the\
  \ distant sound of screams.</p> \n     <p>“Nah,” Reta said. She slid a dried truffle\
  \ from her pocket into Squealy Nord’s mouth and patted the massive pig’s shoulder.\
  \ “Poog fine, he find way back. I hungry. Let’s go get food.”</p> \n    </blockquote>\
