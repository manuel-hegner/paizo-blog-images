  \ Society Organized Play, Part XII: Power through Political Manipulation</h1> \n\

  \ target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderSociety/Taldor_med.jpg\"\
  \ border=\"0\" align=\"right\"></a> \n   <p><i>Since the Age of Enthronement, no\
  \ nation in the Inner Sea has had as wide-reaching and influential an empire as\
  \ the kingdom of Taldor. Sadly, decadence and overconfidence led to the empire's\
  \ relatively swift decline centuries ago, as vassal after vassal broke free from\
  \ the crown. Despite its waning influence worldwide and constant internal political\
  \ strife, Taldor is one of the five nations most strategically poised to take control\
  \ of Absalom from within. Using the same tactics of espionage, sabotage, blackmail,\
  \ and deception employed by Taldan nobility for millennia, agents of this political\
  \ faction hope to manipulate the nobility and citizenry of Absalom to recognize\
  \ the nation's rightful place as the natural ruler of humankind throughout the region.</i></p>\
  \ \n   <div align=\"right\"> \n    <table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"\
  0\" align=\"right\">\n     <tbody>\n      <tr>\n       <td><a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderCampaignSetting/PZO9235-TaldorLady.jpg\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderCampaignSetting/PZO9235-TaldorLady_180.jpeg\"\

  \   </div> \n   <p>The Taldor faction has, since the very beginning of Pathfinder\
  \ Society Organized Play, been in a near-dead heat with the Qadira faction, a fitting\
  \ rivalry given the nations' longstanding feud. In the end, we decided that the\
  \ inability of either nation to pull ahead and truly challenge Osirion or Andoran\
  \ for the top spot on the faction ladder meant something needed to change. So we\
  \ shook things up...</p> \n   <p>Taldor isn't going anywhere, but the faction will\
  \ be led by a new political manipulator in place of Baron Jacquo Dalsine (who many\
  \ pointed out over the years was so uninvolved that he never even bothered to spell\
  \ his name correctly when he signed it on faction missives). Lady Gloriana Morilla,\
  \ pictured here, is also a member of Taldor's thriving noble hierarchy, but she's\
  \ somewhat less concerned with looking good and throwing a good party than she is\
  \ with restoring Taldor to its long-lost glory. She knows that the longer the nation\
  \ rests on its imaginary laurels, the more its influence and gods-decreed dominance\
  \ slip away from the Grand Prince and his loyal subjects. Expect the missions given\
  \ to Taldan characters to focus more on the political intrigue that defines the\
  \ faction starting in Season 3, though characters will still be encouraged to look\
  \ good and make grand spectacles of themselves while carrying them out.</p> \n \
  \  <p>Lady Gloriana and all 10 faction leaders are featured in the upcoming <a href=\"\
  /store/v5748btpy8g79\">Pathfinder Society Field Guide</a>, with a headshot of each\
  \ as well as a brief overview of their backstories, motivations, and personalities.\
  \ We'll also be featuring them as prominent NPCs in adventures set in Absalom, so\
  \ faction members will get the chance to directly interact with the very people\
  \ who dictate so much of their adventuring careers.</p> \n   <p>Come back next week\
  \ for a recap of PaizoCon 2011, the new scenarios released there, and the exclusive\
  \ events attendees will have the option of playing. After that, we'll dive headlong\
  \ into the first of the new factions to be officially announced. This is where it\
  \ gets good!</p> \n   <p>Mark Moreland <br>Developer</p> \n  </blockquote> <!--\
