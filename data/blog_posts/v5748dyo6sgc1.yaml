  \     </div> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">They keep going and going! The folks\
  \ from the Order of the Amber Die have crossed the halfway mark in <i>Doomsday</i><i>Dawn</i>\
  \ finishing \"The Mirrored Moon.\" I just got their report from that session and\
  \ wanted to share it with the rest of you. Keep in mind that there will be spoilers,\
  \ so if you haven't played through this one yet, read this blog later!</p> \n  \
  \   <blockquote> \n      <p>After our initial experiences in <a href=\"http://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo670md?Order-of-the-Amber-DieDoomsday-Dawn-Playtest\"\
  >Part One</a>, <a href=\"http://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sg9p?Order-of-the-Amber-DieDoomsday-Dawn-Playtest\"\
  >Part Two</a>, and <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgb4?Order-of-the-Amber-DieDoomsday-Dawn-Playtest\"\
  >Part Three</a> of the playtest, it was time for part four and our first adventure\
  \ by author Mark Seifter. The pressure was a little higher for this one, because\
  \ it was Mark who first sat with us at PaizoCon 2018 and tossed around the idea\
  \ of doing a full playtest for the Paizo Blog. As this scenario focused on overland\
  \ exploration in an area of the River Kingdoms known as Thicketfell, our GM gathered\
  \ images to match the varying terrain, as well as nature soundscapes to build immersion.\
  \ Perhaps the best effect though, was that while our characters searched extensively\
  \ for a remote pond called the Moonmere, we spent most of the scenario in the natural\
  \ light of a New Jersey autumn.</p> \n      <h2>The Party</h2> \n      <p>As this\
  \ part of the playtest was designed to use the <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo670md?Order-of-the-Amber-DieDoomsday-Dawn-Playtest\"\
  >same four characters as part one</a>, we were able to see how well this non-traditional\
  \ roster of iconics would hold up at higher levels. While Resonance would presumably\
  \ be tough on us without a cleric, this party set out to prove that even a lineup\
  \ without major access to healing could thrive in the new edition. Moreover, this\
  \ was our first time updating characters instead of creating new ones, and as expected,\
  \ it was much faster than drawing them up from scratch. For playtest purposes, the\
  \ same four OAD members played the same iconic characters as part one and listed\
  \ with their names is the year each became a member of the Order (when a player\
  \ has reached 100 hours at our table).</p> \n      <p class=\"stat-block-title\"\

  \    <p>We can count on one hand number of rocs we've encountered over the years.\
  \ Iconic yet elusive, we consider ourselves lucky to come across even one of these\
  \ birds of legend, and \"The Mirrored Moon\" generously delivered two. Our GM was\
  \ so excited that he gleefully placed Fumbus's miniature in its talon when one of\
  \ them snatched the goblin up, then dropped him 135 feet to the ground.</p> \n \
  \     <p>This scenario featured some new game mechanics that had us seeking out\
  \ potential allies as we acquired treasure and research points to aid us in the\
  \ final confrontation. That being said, we did not deliberately set out to exterminate\
  \ an entire clan of cyclopes. Negotiations were going south after a failed diplomacy\
  \ check, and we had our chance to leave, but the halfling's smooth tongue had always\
  \ saved us from these situations. As nine angry cyclopes and their pet smilodon\
  \ closed in, we thought this was going to be the shortest blog report of the past\
  \ few years—until three critical fails against <i>synaptic</i><i>pulse</i> bought\
  \ us precious time, and the win.</p> \n      <p>We challenged norms regarding party\
  \ construction and executed well in what was a very melee-heavy encounter against\
  \ a sizeable force of five trolls and two giants. Seoni's heightened <i>invisibility</i>\
  \ was key here, as was Sajan's ability to run up walls and across water. With the\
  \ battle lasting a grueling 22 rounds, Fumbus's persistent fire damage made a nice\
  \ highlight reel as he lit the trolls up.</p> \n      <h2>Character Deaths</h2>\
  \ \n      <p>After two months of searching, we discovered the Moonmere with just\
  \ a few hours to spare before the Night Heralds summoned a Mu Spore; as such, we\
  \ had to attack without support from potential allies. The result: we TPKed out.\
  \ This scenario was certainly fair—definitely fun—and we gladly accept that this\
  \ loss was on us!</p> \n      <h2>Current Situation</h2> \n      <p>Our record is\
  \ now a gritty 2-2 across the first four scenarios of the <i>Doomsday</i><i>Dawn</i>\
  \ playtest. As you can see from the hex map we marked while exploring Thicketfell,\
  \ we wasted too much time searching for a gnome settlement and still missed it by\
  \ one hex. If we had found it, we'd have procured the necessary ally points and\
  \ would likely be reporting a win. It's a game of inches.</p> \n      <p>Follow\
