  articlebody\"> \n    <p>Tomorrow's my last day working at Paizo Inc.</p> \n    <p>How's\
  \ that for not burying the lede?</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\">\n     <a href=\"\

  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">I could write one heck of a\
  \ self-indulgent retrospective. I'd start by going on about how I've been working\
  \ at Paizo since November 2003 (I would have been 22) and how my first credit was\
  \ as an assistant editor on <em>Dragon Magazine</em> #316. (I'd probably illustrate\
  \ that section with that issue's cover.) Then I'd go on to talk about writing a\
  \ ton of D&amp;D stuff, starting to write adventures, and learning how magazine\
  \ work is actually time travel. After that would be the scary but exciting times—\
  starting Pathfinder Adventure Path, disguising a game as a textbook, long lines,\
  \ yada yada. Things got wild after that.</p> \n    <p>But there's not really time\
  \ for all of that. I've learned a lot in my time at Paizo, but two oft-stated truths\
  \ have proven out again and again: one, never piss off your editor; two, I work\
  \ with a bunch of jackals.</p> \n    <p>About this time tomorrow, there's going\
  \ to be another blog right here. At that time, a bunch of folks who've had to look\
  \ at me everyday—some for well over a decade—are going to have their opportunity\
  \ to say their bon voyages.</p> \n    <p>And they're going to thoroughly roast me.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>I didn't get here being stupid. I've been documenting, hoarding, recording,\
  \ and preparing for this moment for most of my adult life. And I know that if you're\
  \ going to get into a blog fight, fire first.</p> \n    <p>To that end, here are\
  \ the secrets.</p> \n    <p><b>Adam Daigle</b>: Adam knows the time and place for\
  \ everything—for getting things done, for getting a drink, for getting your abdomen\
  \ severed from your thorax, and for not backing up claims that you're a bad-@#%\
  \ cook. Most folks don't know that Adam is responsible for more issues of <em>Dragon\
  \ Magazine</em> releasing on time than some people who worked on that magazine's\
  \ staff. More than once something went down on a Friday and by Monday morning Adam\
  \ just had it handled. He definitely knows the curse of becoming an editor's go-to\
  \ guy. I have boundless respect for Adam's unique blend of solid writing and creepy\
  \ swamp witchery and look forward to his next big thing, be it a mega-adventure,\
  \ restaurant chain, or the burgeoning fiction career he's no good at hiding!</p>\
  \ \n    <p><b>Adam Vick &amp; Emily Crowell</b>: Adam and Emily might be two of\
  \ the only truly sane souls at Paizo—stark comparisons against the rest of the company's\
  \ wards. They both do fantastic work, but they're also the second generation of\
  \ an experiment into how long it takes for normal designers to be infected with\
  \ RPG gibberish. (Sarah was part of the initial research, but now she can tell you\
  \ all about driders and bullywugs.) There's not much of an end goal here, and we\
  \ couldn't ask for more in regard to design finesse, but I know there's collectively\
  \ a lot of interest in debating the finer points of Bloodrager feats and outsider\
  \ subtypes with Adam and Emily down the road.</p> \n    <p><b>Amanda Hamon Kunz</b>:\
  \ Amanda's one of the most clever, most capable, most quietly depraved people I've\
  \ ever had a pleasure of knowing. She wears a <i>ring of mind shielding</i>, but\
  \ she's quick to say she just likes the look. (To quote Jessica Price, \"There's\
  \ a darkness in her.\") I've thrown Amanda more—much more—than her fair share of\
  \ trash-fires and she's never once so much as sighed or stabbed me in the face.\
  \ Early on in our working arrangement I asked that, when the time comes, she make\
  \ my end quiet and quick. She couldn't make any promises. I respect that. I'd say\
  \ to watch out for Amanda, but it will be far less stressful to just let the inevitable\
  \ come.</p> \n    <p><b>Chris Lambertz</b>: Chris cultivates the best stuffed critter\
  \ shelf at Paizo. Her miniature army helps her fend off the endless press of tiny\
  \ typhoons that endlessly wash across her desk. Her hordes also defend dual hidden\
  \ fonts, one of boundless pragmatism and the other of boundless optimism. She uses\
  \ these to look forward to better things even as she wrangles the calamity du jour.\
  \ You might not know Chris, but she believes in you, the great person you are, and\
  \ the better person you can be. If you ever receive moderation from her, count yourself\
  \ lucky... then consider making deep spiritual improvements in your life.</p> \n\
  \    <p><b>Christopher Carey</b>: Aside from being a phenomenal editor, Chris is\
  \ the most accomplished Paizo author you probably haven't read. He has several weighty\
  \ tomes under his belt—<a href=\"http://cpcarey.com/site/tag/gods-of-opar/\" target=\"\
  _blank\">go buy them</a>. Whether it's editing a massive mess of a document or working\
  \ on his next literary behemoth, Chris proves the results of building your house\
  \ one brick at a time. How such a reliable, determined professional wound up editing\
  \ our nerd-books has always slightly baffled me, but much of Paizo's editorial quality\
  \ and consistency stems directly from his red pen.</p> \n    <p><b>Cosmo Eisele</b>:\
  \ Cosmo deserves less blame than he accepts... but only a little. That's probably\
  \ just part of being legitimately one of the nicest chaps at Paizo. He's traveling\
  \ the world much more these days, so if you get the chance to meet up with him,\
  \ buy him a drink—he gets more sass than he deserves.</p> \n    <p><b>Crystal Frasier</b>:\
  \ I don't really believe in talent. There's failure, there's determination, there's\
  \ improvement, there's even inborn advantage, but there aren't really magical gifts.\
  \ And I refuse to factor Crystal Frasier into that algebra. You could say she's\
  \ a double threat, or a triple threat, but then you keep counting and once you get\
  \ to calling people septuple or octuple threats you start sounding silly. Crystal's\
  \ a great writer, an incredible artist, a skilled graphic designer, a killer cartographer,\
  \ an adept editor, a riveting storyteller, a terrifying bare-knuckle scrapper, and\
  \ so forth. She can pretty much do it all—and largely has. At some point, the rest\
  \ of us are largely around just because it'd be too time consuming for her to handle\
  \ absolutely everything by herself. And none of this comports with my understanding\
  \ of how creatives learn and improve over time. So, the secret is that maybe some\
  \ people do have magical gifts. That's the only way Crystal Frasier makes any sense.</p>\
  \ \n    <p><b>Dan Tharp</b>: Dan's actually a mimic. I would have said doppleganger,\
  \ but he's largely a communications dude, so something with a big mouth seemed more\
  \ suiting. Paizo's been around for a long time and many folks have been there forever.\
  \ I wouldn't call it unfriendly, but the ruts and grooves, the routines and methods\
  \ are ground in both procedurally and socially. It can be daunting coming in, like\
  \ attending a new school in a town you didn't grow up in. But somehow Dan sauntered\
  \ in and convinced everybody he's been there the whole time. He's got an easy confidence,\
  \ an \"I can do that!\" attitude, and that sort of expressive enthusiasm that both\
  \ gamers and game makers love. A lot of folks have a lot of opinions about what\
  \ Paizo's Outreach Coordinator should and could do, so we're lucky to have found\
  \ a shapeshifter up to doing it and being it all!</p> \n    <p><b>Dean Ludwig, Don\
  \ Hayes, Erik Keith, &amp; Gary Teter</b>: The legend goes that Paizo.com was birthed\
  \ amid sparks, three scotch-taped Magnavox Odyssey consoles, and 36 feet of string\
  \ cheese. I can't speak much toward legends, but there's often a hint of hidden\
  \ truth (perhaps not in this case, but often). In any case, the tech team has worked\
  \ wonders under the cover of code to assure that Paizo can do all the varied things\
  \ the company needs to do and then some and then some again. Few can say how many\
  \ countless nights and weekends the team's put in, but I'm certain that without\
  \ them we'd all be filling out subscription renewal cards to this day.</p> \n  \
  \  <p><b>Erik Mona</b>: Here's a good one: You think you know roleplaying games.\
  \ You don't. Erik Mona knows roleplaying games. The history, the characters, the\
  \ origins, the inspirations, the characters, the players, the pedigrees, the big\
  \ successes, the dismal failures, the dark secrets. Erik hasn't just stumbled across\
  \ this info, he's collected it—he's horded it. He knows more than he could ever\
  \ tell you, and he knows the roots and shadowy grit beneath that. The game industry\
  \ and everything in its orbit has been his game, his obsession, for a long time.\
  \ And no one plays a game for that long without getting damn good at it. As a result,\
  \ though, Erik's path has lead him down a businessmanly road, a route upon that's\
  \ made him more of a behind-the-scenes player than a name you see on lots of covers\
  \ these days—with the exception of <a href=\"/products/btpy9oco?Pathfinder-Worldscape-1\"\
  >Pathfinder Worldscape</a>, which is now officially required reading. In my opinion,\
  \ though, gaming could use a few more <em>Greyhawk Gazetteers</em> and <em>Mutants\
  \ &amp; Masterminds: Crooks</em>. It could certainly use a Nex book. Probably some\
  \ old-school trap riddled adventures, too. Just sayin'.</p> \n    <p>Erik's been\
  \ my boss for a long time. We've worked well together and have pulled off some pretty\
  \ cool stunts. I could chalk up this long, successful partnership to shared tastes\
  \ and work ethics, but I know there's a secret, a deceptively simple mantra Erik\
  \ ingrains in everyone on his crew: Do your job, Be exceptional, Wear shoes. Words\
  \ to live, to work, and to manage by that have had a profound impact on my life.\
  \ Over the years, Erik's been a ready collaborator, an open-minded listener, a font\
  \ of fascinating stories, and a good friend, and even though I won't be working\
  \ at Paizo next week, I don't expect any of those things to change.</p> \n    <p><b>James\
  \ Jacobs</b>: One of my favorite stories about starting at Paizo is that in 2003\
  \ I moved 3,000 miles from Baltimore, Maryland to Renton, Washington... and blindly\
  \ into the apartment next door to James Jacobs. For much of my time living in Washington,\
  \ my front door has been within 200 steps of James's (and often far closer). For\
  \ more of that time, James's desk has been within 20 steps of mine (and often far\
  \ closer). James is a fire hose of cool stuff, whether it's these hundred games\
  \ you have to play or these thousand movies you need to see. It's impossible for\
  \ that sort of tsunami to not influence an assistant editor in his twenties, which\
  \ is likely partially why we've worked so well together for so long—whether collaborating\
  \ on adventures for <em>Dungeon</em>, sculpting the Pathfinder Adventure Path series,\
  \ building corners of the Pathfinder world, or tinkering with a thousand other projects.\
  \ James also quickly learned that \"carpool buddy\" and \"confessor\" mean pretty\
  \ much the same thing to me. As a result, he knows where more of the skeletons are\
  \ buried than anyone else. That, time, proximity, and shared dementia make him a\
  \ friend, a brother, and a man too dangerous to antagonize. Therefore, it is in\
  \ my best interest to keep James's secrets well guarded.</p> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurb360\">\n     <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/Carbuncle.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/Carbuncle_360.jpeg\"></a>\n \
  \   </div> \n    <p><b>James L. Sutter</b>: Despite all evidence to the contrary,\
  \ Sutter and I are, in fact, two different people. Shocking, but true. The root\
  \ of the confusion seems to be that we both have brownish hair and wear the same\
  \ size jeans. We've also collaborated on one or two projects, from <a href=\"/threads/rzs2gex6?Shut-In\"\
  >\"Shut In\"</a> in <em>Dungeon</em> #128 (2005) to, well, today—you're all picking\
  \ up <a href=\"/products/btpy9sgl?Pathfinder-Runescars-1\">Pathfinder Runescars</a>,\
  \ right?! I coached Sutter through his first adventure, Sutter coached me through\
  \ my first novel, and we both endlessly tell the other that all his ideas are stupid.\
  \ But when either of us say that, the other knows it's not just being mean, it's\
  \ also being honest. We've both had more than our share of missteps on the road\
  \ to the next big or new or fun thing and we've been upfront with each other about\
  \ those blunders. When I've mucked something up, I tell Sutter it didn't work. When\
  \ Sutter mucks something up, he tells me not to do that. We've been climbing over\
  \ each other's corpses for a long time. Undoubtedly I wouldn't be anywhere near\
  \ where I am today, or have done half of what I've done, without Sutter's advice,\
  \ example, edits, and encouragement. But for @#$%'s sake, people, he's got a beard!\
  \ We don't look anything alike!</p> \n    <p><b>Jason Bulmahn</b>: Sometimes, after\
  \ spending a decade gaslighting a man, you have regrets. In the best cases, though,\
  \ you look back, satisfied at a job well done. Efforts proceeded in thorough, themed\
  \ campaigns—spiders, tokkens, ponies, letter transposition, tokkens 2, tokkens 3\
  \ (there were clearly favorites). Jason brought this harassment on himself in two\
  \ ways. First, he gift-wrapped my cube in 2006 (there are probably pictures). Second,\
  \ he does everything \"big.\" He designs big games, he makes big books, he draws\
  \ big maps, and he has big reactions. Jason never stopped being an architect; he's\
  \ always been addicted to scale. Go big or go home is pretty much the Bulmahn motto—\
  perhaps followed closely by \"the ends justify the means.\" He's certainly got a\
  \ track record with far more gigantic successes than colossal failures, which I'm\
  \ certain spurs him to do more ever bigger. I can't wait to see what gargantuan\
  \ he's working on next, and am relatively certain that I haven't been swept up in\
  \ his madness for the last time. But what's the secret? Well, there's sort of a\
  \ lot here, but if you want something concrete: we legally changed the spelling\
  \ of Jason's last name in 2008.</p> \n    <p><b>Jason Keeley</b>: Someday you'll\
  \ all know Jason Keeley as the world's most effective method ad-lib actor. I'm not\
  \ sure that he's actually employed at Paizo, but the bit's been running for so long\
  \ that it hardly matters now. \"Yes, and...\" is pretty much in Jason's blood.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Jason, you're an editor,\" it started.<br> \"Yes, and...\" he said.<br>\
  \ \"Now you're doing development, too.\"<br> \"Yes, and...\"<br> \"Now you're one\
  \ of the leads on Starfinder.\"<br> \"Yes, and...\"</p> \n    <p>I can't predict\
  \ where this is all going, but every step of the way Jason's jumped right in, rolled\
  \ with things, and done an exemplary (and utterly believable) job. I look forward\
  \ to his inevitable design and management performances. Though it's going to be\
  \ an awkward day when he finally calls \"scene\" and no one's knows what he's talking\
  \ about. You can check out Jason's previous performances, like <em>Fortune's Fool</em>\
  \ at <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pantheonpress/\" target=\"_blank\">Pantheon\
  \ Press</a>.</p> \n    <p><b>Jeff Alvarez</b>: Jeff keeps a secret few folks at\
  \ Paizo know: Paizo isn't a company, it's a train. There are big mechanical parts,\
  \ tons of fuel, numerous cars, and track—endless track. For anything to work, it's\
  \ all got to work together—maybe not perfectly, but as well as possible. Jeff is\
  \ Mr. Make-It-Happen, whether that's helping to plot a route or being part of the\
  \ team laying track ahead of the locomotive. He's never been too good to help pack\
  \ a crate or too careless not to consider how a strategy might affect every part\
  \ of the machine. He also knows that sometimes the crew just needs to blow off steam,\
  \ and if that's going happen, there better be good food and even better drink. It's\
  \ been said that Jeff's in charge of everything \"that's real\" at Paizo. That's\
  \ one hell of a responsibility, and it can surely be a loud, dirty, and relentless\
  \ a job. But one thing's for sure, the Paizo engine would have skipped the tracks\
  \ a long time ago without him.</p> \n    <p><b>Jenny Bendel</b>: You will never\
  \ have more friends than Jenny Bendel. Every time I've ever been anywhere with Jenny\
  \ she's had to step away to greet some new-coming mover-and-shaker, gaming legend,\
  \ '90s rock icon, or other charmer. It's easy to see why, though, as Jenny's one\
  \ of the most easily enthusiastic people I've ever had the pleasure of knowing.\
  \ She also has a second sense for knowing \"the place to be,\" which leads her on\
  \ all manner of adventures. Unfortunately, I don't get to see Jenny often, but when\
  \ she's in town, she always brings the best stories.</p> \n    <p><b>Jessica Price</b>:\
  \ Here's a secret for those of you who haven't been paying attention: Jessica Price\
  \ does not want to hear about your character. Jessica's the smartest person in a\
  \ room full of people used to being the smartest person in the room. She doesn't\
  \ care how it's always been done, she doesn't care about momentum or tradition,\
  \ she doesn't care about well enough, she cares about what works, how it could work\
  \ better, and how to build things cooler than what's come before. It might not be\
  \ easy and some tables might need to be flipped, but it'll be worth it in the end.\
  \ Jessica has challenged me on my ideas and my methods, she's criticized my calls,\
  \ she's pointed out my screw-ups, she's slammed my office door—and I can't thank\
  \ her enough. I'm no genius, but if there's one thing I know is worth its weight\
  \ is gold, it's a smart critic (and woe betide those who dismiss cagey critics).\
  \ Jessica has walked me through basic concepts for the fiftieth time, she's dealt\
  \ with important things I can't give my full attention, she's coached me through\
  \ handling public gaffs, and she's strategized how to do better the next time. She's\
  \ committed enough to have written thousands of words of cover copy and solicitation\
  \ text, able enough to have developed whole hardcover books, and invested enough\
  \ to spend her own time developing the Pathfinder world (you've all picked up <a\
  \ href=\"products/btpy9qib\"><em>Qadira</em></a>, right?!). And she's done all this,\
  \ while getting Paizo's products more consistently on schedule than ever before.\
  \ Jessica has been a collaborator, a noble friend, and my fearless champion. I can't\
  \ thank her enough for all that she's done—that which I know and that which I'll\
  \ never know. But a word to the wise: don't waste Jessica's time with characters\
  \ you've been playing for thirty years. Instead, share what cool ideas you have\
  \ for the new thing you're trying tomorrow (and even then, keep it short).</p> \n\
  \    <p><b>Joe Pasini</b>: I'm undecided here, as he and I haven't worked together\
  \ for terribly long, but I'm pretty convinced that Joe's either a truth wizard or\
  \ the Platonic spirit of editorship. Joe can make anything, no matter how ludicrous,\
  \ sound perfectly earnest—even sensible. I chalk this up to either weird powers\
  \ of manipulation, or his fundamental mastery of an editor's ability to bring even\
  \ the most bizarre concepts to linguistic heel. I'm leaning toward truth wizard,\
  \ though—especially after I found myself thanking him and Jason Keeley for letting\
  \ me be a guest on a podcast they don't have. (Yet?)</p> \n    <p><b>John Compton</b>:\
  \ If you know when and how to look, you'll realize that John Compton is the reincarnation\
  \ of Roman Emperor Antoninus Augustus Pius. It's most obvious in the Pathfinder\
  \ Society room at Gen Con—the combination of public speaking, raised platforms,\
  \ and scurrying governors is something of a give away. John has his predecessor's\
  \ flair for empire building, for management on a massive scale, for oratory, for\
  \ diplomacy, and for decisive justice. Where most would crack under the pressure\
  \ of so many responsibilities, John weathers it all with the marble facade equal\
  \ to his forebearer's sculptures. Many have expected great things from John, and\
  \ all of them had their expectations exceeded. John is also an amazing game designer,\
  \ adventure crafter, and perhaps Paizo's best Game Master, but unfortunately comparison\
  \ of these virtues to Emperor Antoninus Pius is beyond my scholarship. In short,\
  \ hail Caesar, long may he reign.</p> \n    <p><b>John Parrish</b>: John comes from\
  \ a much realer, more sensible world than most folks at Paizo are accustomed to\
  \ or wholly comfortable with. As a reprehensive of the real, John exudes competency,\
  \ efficiently, and trustworthiness. If John says something's the case, I'm confident\
  \ it's the case, and no amount of flailing is going to change the matter. There's\
  \ real comfort to that in an industry where so much is made up and rules exist to\
  \ be bent. Despite all this, John wears his adventurous streak like an Iron Maiden\
  \ tie tack and his rare jokes are a characteristically reliable vein of comedy gold.\
  \ Paizo couldn't be luckier to have him—wherever he's from.</p> \n    <p><b>Judy\
  \ Bauer</b>: You do not mess with Judy Bauer. Judy Bauer's desk is decorated in\
  \ things made from thread she wove herself and carrion. Judy Bauer once stabbed\
  \ a god in the eye with a hypodermic needle because she was curious about science.\
  \ Judy Bauer is never not wearing her poker face. Judy is one of the world's hyper-competents,\
  \ and the rest of us rely on good people like her to accomplish absolutely anything\
  \ at all. You—wise soul that you are—do not mess with Judy Bauer. And neither do\
  \ I. As such, Judy's secrets remain her own.</p> \n    <p><b>Laura Carey, Mika Hawkins,\
  \ Heather Payne, Jeff Strand, &amp; Kevin Underwood</b>: Are the names of the oft-referenced\
  \ cave raptors that stalk the warehouse. They are the second most affable contingent\
  \ of Paizo staffers, but the most thoroughly and elaborately armed. Their smiles\
  \ prove they have sharp teeth and know that soft-skinned creatives keep to their\
  \ carpet-covered places. They're known for their quick, sturdy caliber of sass and\
  \ for accomplishing the impossible month after month. They're certainly not known\
  \ for any unidentifiable packing-tape mummies above the downstairs kitchen.</p>\
  \ \n    <p><b>Linda Zayas-Palmer</b>: You wouldn't guess it from her quick grin\
  \ or unabashed love of leshies, but beneath that \"I'd leave her alone with my kids\"\
  \ exterior, Linda is made of knives. Not so much the stabbing kind of knives, more\
  \ the \"let's put googley eyes on this and give it a squeaky voice\" sort of knives.\
  \ But, you know, still knives. Linda's got a sharp mind for systems and readily\
  \ sees how every little thing works. If she's not designing her own bizarrely elegant\
  \ games already, I expect she will be very soon.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p><b>Lisa Stevens</b>: Lisa's seen it all, done it all,\
  \ and is always up for doing it all again. That's probably why every year her \"\
  Auntie Lisa's Story Hour\" gets just a little bit longer. By 2030 you can look forward\
  \ to a fifth day of PaizoCon composed entirely of that event. Despite her incredible\
  \ experience, though, Lisa's never let \"been there, done that\" or \"know-it-all-ism\"\
  \ set in. She's cultivated a beautiful, diverse asylum at Paizo, and her willingness\
  \ to listen and try things new ways are undoubtedly secrets behind her company's\
  \ success. I'm far from unique in this regard, but I wouldn't be where I am today\
  \ without Lisa's hard work, her boundless enthusiasm for games, and her eye for\
  \ good people. For all that, I'm beyond grateful.</p> \n    <p><b>Lissa Guillet</b>:\
  \ While I'm not sure of the specifics, Lissa did something and now computers fear\
  \ her. I've tested this on multiple occasions. No sooner does Lissa walk into a\
  \ room than rowdy technology gets back in line. For now she's largely using her\
  \ leverage for good. For now.</p> \n    <p><b>Logan Bonner</b>: Logan is precision\
  \ instrument—like a scalpel or a really big scalpel. Amid teams prone to flights\
  \ of fancy, to overelaboration, to using a thousand words where ten would do, Logan\
  \ excels at getting to the meat of the matter and to excising the fat. He's a veteran\
  \ game maker, so a lot of that is simply second nature at this point. But if you\
  \ look at what he designs, you'll find a lot of him in the work—systems with complex\
  \ subtlety that get the job done and have the potential to be a hell of a lot of\
  \ fun.</p> \n    <p><b>Mark Moreland</b>: Mark's also a collector and chronicler—\
  and that makes him dangerous. He likes knowing the details, putting them in order,\
  \ and figuring out the secrets. Mark's revealed countless holes in supposedly foolproof\
  \ plots over the years and is more than willing to share his mind. He's like a favorite\
  \ cousin who has a knack for pissing off your parents. I jokingly tell Mark to shut\
  \ up with some frequency, but I don't know that I've ever told him he's wrong. Too\
  \ often we can't see the specifics of the pictures we paint, but Mark's got a damn\
  \ keen eye for details.</p> \n    <p><b>Mark Seifter</b>: Seifter is radiation.\
  \ Not, like, the bad kind, but the sort of sci-fi radiation that makes things grow\
  \ in brilliantly unpredictable ways. Rather than growing plants or Hulks, though,\
  \ Mark grows intricate rules systems, transforming the mundane into marvels. Fortunately,\
  \ this boundless energy has been a boon to those in need, from fellow designers\
  \ to questioning forum posters. Whether in brainstorms or on the convention floor,\
  \ Mark's vigor is unignorable and promises a future vibrant with mighty things.</p>\
  \ \n    <p><b>Mike Kenway</b>: Kenway thinks I've been ignoring his emails, IMs,\
  \ and sticky notes all this time as a joke. The secret is that I haven't been. I've\
  \ been ignoring them for real. I'll miss filling your chair cushions with woodlice,\
  \ Kenway—that's the god's honest truth.</p> \n    <p><b>Owen KC Stephens</b>: Owen\
  \ got his job by doing solid design work and being a damn nice guy. He then proved\
  \ himself to have an utterly insufferable combination of intelligence, outspokenness,\
  \ experience, and relentlessness that's led him to positively reshape every project\
  \ he's been a part of. Owen plays the guru well, but he's most at home in the thick\
  \ of things, testing, debating, and redesigning. He's nothing short of a powerhouse.\
  \ And then we put him in the same room with Rob McCreary and from their debates\
  \ a secret source of endless—but largely unmarketable—energy was achieved.</p> \n\
  \    <p><b>Pierce Watters</b>: More trivia than a secret: You're probably only one\
  \ step removed from personally knowing somebody who personally knows Pierce Watters.\
  \ Pierce knows everybody, has been everywhere, has done everything, and is happy\
  \ to tell you why that thing is either a fantastic idea or a fantastically horrible\
  \ idea. If there ever is or ever was a publishing and gaming equivalent of gonzo\
  \ journalism, Pierce would be one of the greats. I haven't always grokked everything\
  \ Pierce has told me stories about, but I've always appreciated being invited along\
  \ for the ride.</p> \n    <p><b>Rick Kunz</b>: Rick Kunz is an intellect ouroboros.\
  \ Rick's one of those guys who can look at a system, analyze it, and find the best\
  \ solution in 5 minutes. If there's something he doesn't know, he'll teach himself.\
  \ If there's information someone else has, he'll get it out of them and iterate\
  \ something better. If there's a problem that needs fixing, he'll find a solution.\
  \ Rick's one of those guys who can do or could do anything... and who also calls\
  \ himself a dumb guy. Which leads me to believe that he either has a low opinion\
  \ of his brilliance or he's smart enough to know the value of being underestimated.\
  \ A cagey enigma, that one, but well worth keeping an eye on.</p> \n    <p><b>Robert\
  \ G. McCreary</b>: Rob hasn't aged a day since washing up on the shore near Hampton\
  \ amid the wreckage of the USS Cumberland. In the years since, he's eluded a lucrative,\
  \ globetrotting career as a hand model to become the world's most deliberate RPG\
  \ adventure developer. Rob is host to multitudes, which means he can argue anything\
  \ from any angle. It also gives him a breadth of perspective that makes him one\
  \ of the best character creators and editors in the biz.</p> \n    <p><b>Sara Marie</b>:\
  \ In a cynical world of customers who are \"always\"—audible eyeroll—\"right\" and\
  \ companies that put patrons first(-ish), it's hard to consider standards of customer\
  \ service much more than marketing ploys. But that's not the case for Sara Marie.\
  \ Giving everybody a fair shake, bending over backward to address an issue, and\
  \ working long hours to organize a fan-focused show like PaizoCon, they're all something\
  \ akin to duty for her. That's one of the most difficult to believe secrets I've\
  \ written today: that for Sara Marie, doing right by Paizo's customers isn't a gimmick,\
  \ it's the honest truth.</p> \n    <p><b>Sarah Robinson</b>: Sarah has like thirty\
  \ super powers. The greatest, though, is that she can walk into a restaurant, glance\
  \ at a menu, and <em>instantly</em> know the best thing on it. (If you ever go get\
  \ food with Sarah, order what she's having.) She can also create art and laid-out\
  \ pages by force of will, but activating it usually comes at a price in developer\
  \ skins. The economics here get tricky. Regardless, Sarah's one of the top three\
  \ secrets to Paizo's success. If you've ever picked up a Pathfinder or Starfinder\
  \ book, leafed through, and said \"wow\" within the first minute, it's probably\
  \ because of her.</p> \n    <p><b>Sharaya Copas, Katina Davis, Diego Valdez, &amp;\
  \ Scott Keim</b>: Aside from being several of the champions that keep Paizo running\
  \ from day to day, our Customer Service team, Sharaya, Katina, and Diego, and Data\
  \ Entry Clerk Scott Keim are some of the company's best. They're always beyond friendly\
  \ and are endlessly willing—even eager—to pitch in, to playtest a game, and to give\
  \ honest feedback. Those of us in editorial might not get to interact with them\
  \ as often, but some of Paizo's most major products would be entirely different\
  \ without their efforts and insight.</p> \n    <p><b>Sonja Morris</b>: Sonja's captain\
  \ of Team Bombproof. Any project or in-process fire can land on her desk and everyone\
  \ will be confident that she'll handle it. It's not always glamorous, but it's appreciated\
  \ far more than people say. Add to that Sonja's ability to work with anyone on anything,\
  \ her years of experience, and her quiet dark streak, and you've got the makings\
  \ of one of Paizo's true superstars. I'll miss our cyclical rounds of \"What do\
  \ you need? No, what do you need?\"</p> \n    <p><b>Stephen Radney-MacFarland</b>:\
  \ Perhaps not a huge secret, but Stephen has one of the best s@#%-sniffers in the\
  \ business. He's a fantastic critic, and doesn't care about your intention or your\
  \ opinion. In the aftermath of a project, there's no disguising his judgments. Before\
  \ that, though, while there's work to be done, Stephen's one of the best project\
  \ wranglers and design sculptors what there is. You don't want collaborators who\
  \ are only going to be half-enthused about your work, and Stephen's not interested\
  \ in half measures. If it's good, it's done. If it's bad, he'll help you fix it...\
  \ maybe. It's an uncomplicated arrangement, but it's one that's led me to trust\
  \ Stephen's opinion more than most.</p> \n    <p><b>Tonya Woldridge</b>: Many folks\
  \ know Tonya has a military background—most Venture-Officers have firsthand experience\
  \ with her knack for organization. No one ever ask what century's military her experience\
  \ is with, though. An expert time traveler, Tonya has clear access to a repository\
  \ of excess hours. There's no other explanation for how she attends to all manner\
  \ of Organized Play business at all hours of the day and night, weekdays and weekends,\
  \ time zones be damned. Organized Play programs of the past, present, and future\
  \ has never been in more able hands. Now if only she'd share her chronomasterful\
  \ ways.</p> \n    <p><b>Vic Wertz</b>: If it's a job at Paizo, Vic's probably done\
  \ it. He's edited books, he's designed games, he's moderated the forums, he's architected\
  \ the website, he's pitched projects, he's set strategy, he's done it all and has\
  \ schemes for what's come next. Vic has as keen sense of the Paizo that Paizo could\
  \ be and is eager to get there. So, if helping to edit an article or move a box\
  \ full of board games is the next hurdle in the company's path, he's happy to help\
  \ clear it. The same goes for Paizo's entire executive team, but with Vic there's\
  \ always a matter-of-factness, a \"this is happening\" attitude that makes it clear\
  \ no hurdle's insurmountable.</p> \n    <p><b>Will Chase</b>: You're not going to\
  \ impress Will Chase. Will has this seen-it-all, done-it-all air. On top of that,\
  \ dude manages a warehouse full of games and has the keys to a forklift with a Cthulhu\
  \ bumper sticker. He doesn't wow easy. There's a difference between people who get\
  \ things done and people with a \"let's not make this a problem\" attitude. It's\
  \ the difference between knowing the way to a place, but also knowing the back roads.\
  \ Will knows all the roads, so it's probably in your best interest to buy him a\
  \ drink.</p> \n    <p>And that about does it. While it probably doesn't forestall\
  \ tomorrow's abuse, at the very least it should leave the scales karmically even.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Even though I won't be at Paizo day to day anymore, it's not like I'm\
  \ frickin' dying. I'll certainly still be around on the boards and likely in print\
  \ every now and then. You can also keep up with my schemes in all the places I usually\
  \ haunt—most obviously on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FWesSchneider\" target=\"\

  \ again to everyone at Paizo, to all the incredible Paizo authors and artists, and\
  \ to those in the wider Paizo community for what's been an amazing ride. I couldn't\
  \ be more awestruck by all your incredible work or more excited for what's to come.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Keep up all the awesome.</p> \n    <p>~W</p> \n    <p>F. Wesley Schneider<br>\
