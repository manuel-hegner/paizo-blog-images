  \ \n    <p>Today I'm traveling back to Seattle from Quad Cities, Iowa, where we\
  \ just wrapped the inaugural Quad Cities Game Fest. The convention hosted board\
  \ games, RPGs, card games, vendors, bingo, and kid's activities—and this isn't even\
  \ the whole list! Pathfinder took up about a fifth of the space, with a full roster\
  \ of Pathfinder Society games. I ran <a href=\"/products/btpy88sz\"><em>Hands of\
  \ the Muted God</em></a> twice this weekend, and the seats for these games were\
  \ raffle prizes benefitting the Juvenile Diabetes Research Fund. I enjoyed GMing\
  \ these tables, and while I don't often get to utilize my license to kill, but two\
  \ more characters (and an animal companion) did briefly visit Pharasma's Boneyard.\
  \ You can call me Bond, Tonya Bond. Thanks to Dave, Barrett, VC James Martin, and\
  \ all fantastic new friends for a blockbuster weekend!</p> \n    <p>On the subject\
  \ of fantastic people, several dedicated GMs reached their fifth star over the past\
  \ few weeks. Please join me in congratulating the following for their achievement.\
  \ Huzzah!</p> \n    <ul>\n     <li>Marc Daoust</li> \n     <li>Richard deMorris</li>\
  \ \n     <li>Michel Lepage</li> \n     <li>Chris Manning</li> \n     <li>Jeremy\
  \ Mayr</li> \n     <li>Andrew Porter</li> \n     <li>Andrew Watson</li> \n     <li>Pete\
  \ Winz</li>\n    </ul> \n    <p>Shifting gears, I have a few pieces of news on the\
  \ topic of conventions. A few weeks ago, I unveiled a new Event Support Policy on\
  \ the blog. It generated quite a bit of discussion, and I put a note in the comments\
  \ that the team had read the commentary and was reassessing the program. I intended\
  \ to post the revised policy today, but unfortunately technical difficulties while\
  \ on the road meant I couldn't access my notes. I ask for your patience for just\
  \ a bit longer while I return to Seattle, retrieve my notes, and pull the edges\
  \ together. In the meantime, no convention is being denied support, whether it is\
  \ in a retail location or not, the packages just vary according to location.</p>\
  \ \n    <p><a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5liqc\">In a previous blog</a>, John introduced\
  \ the Pathfinder Society <a href=\"/paizocon\">PaizoCon</a> events, including some\
  \ one of a kind adventures, out of retirement scenarios, and panels. Last week,\
  \ our Customer Service team posted the <a href=\"/paizocon/events\">Event Schedulde</a>,\
  \ and I urge everyone who is going to PaizoCon to take a look and sign up quickly\
  \ with your lottery preferences. Don't procrastinate—lottery selections end on May\
  \ 9th!</p> \n    <p>Official Pathfinder Society events in the Grand Ballroom are\
  \ being run in the morning and evening slots at PaizoCon (with the exception of\
  \ Saturday night, when we host the annual <a href=\"/products/btpy9jc3\">PaizoCon\
  \ Preview Banquet</a>. However, you may play in or run pickup games during the afternoon\
  \ slots. Venture-Lieutenant Louis Manko-Levite has taken up the coordinator mantle\
  \ for organizing afternoon games. If you'd like to run an afternoon PFS game, <a\
  \ href=\"mailto:taenia4000@yahoo.com?Subject=PaizoCon%202016%20Afternoon%20Game\"\
  >email Louis</a> with the scenario you'd like to run and desired slot (Friday, Saturday,\
  \ or Sunday). These games will then be added to the overall PaizoCon schedule, and\
  \ will have a reserved table in the Grand Ballroom. You may also opt to bring a\
  \ physical sign-up sheet to PFS Headquarters, where we'll post your game onsite.\
  \ For attendees looking to play in these games, you may sign up during Open Registration\
  \ on the <a href=\"/paizocon/events\">Event Schedule page</a> ahead of time, or\
  \ stop by PFS Headquarters at the convention.</p> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\"\
  >Volunteers are what make our conventions go! At this time, I have a full schedule\
  \ of volunteers for PaizoCon 2016. However, I see need a handful of volunteers for\
  \ Gen Con 2016, specifically Roleplaying Guild, Pathfinder Society Academy: Kid's\
  \ Track GMs, and I'm looking for volunteers willing to accept Tier 1, 5, or 6 status.\
  \ I could also use a few people for my waitlist, in the event that there are cancellations\
  \ between now and Gen Con. If you're interested, please read over the <a href=\"\
  /paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lie2\">Gen Con 2016 Call for Volunteers</a> and follow the\
  \ instructions found there.</p> \n    <p>During convention season, we get quite\
  \ a few questions from PaizoCon and Gen Con volunteers regarding how and when they'll\
  \ get scenarios they've volunteered to run. Our Community &amp; Digital Content\
  \ Director, Chris Lambertz, has provided all that you need to know about that process\
  \ below:</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>If you've volunteered to run an existing\
  \ scenario, they will be assigned to your account as scheduling information is confirmed.\
  \ You will receive an email notifying you that these are available, and you will\
  \ be able to download them from your My Downloads page immediately.</p> \n     <p>If\
  \ you've volunteered to run a special or yet-to-be-released scenario, they will\
  \ be benchmarked as assigned to your account as scheduling information is confirmed.\
  \ An email is automatically generated from our system that these have been added\
  \ to your account at this stage. However, your My Downloads page may indicate that\
  \ these are not immediately available for download, but don't panic! Once the Pathfinder\
  \ Society team completes these scenarios, and they are uploaded to our system, an\
  \ update email will be sent to all volunteers indicating that they are now downloadable.\
  \ If for any reason you have not received a second email, be sure to double check\
  \ your My Downloads page <i>before</i> posting, or emailing Tonya or Customer Service.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>If you are a volunteer for PaizoCon or Gen Con, and you have not received\
  \ your downloads for scenarios you are scheduled to run by the <b>week prior</b>\
  \ to the convention you're volunteering at, please email <a href=\"mailto:customer.service@paizo.com\"\
  >customer.service@paizo.com</a> and CC tonya.woldridge@paizo.com.</p> \n    </blockquote>\
  \ \n    <p>Gen Con is previewing the 2016 event catalog on their website starting\
  \ at noon this Friday, May 6. Next Monday's blog will provide more information about\
  \ Paizo's lineup, as well as an introduction to this years team leading the volunteer\
  \ crew at Gen Con. Tune in to get the inside scoop!</p> \n    <p>Until next time—\
  Explore, Report, Cooperate!</p> \n    <p>Tonya Woldridge<br> <i>Organized Play Coordinator</i></p>\
