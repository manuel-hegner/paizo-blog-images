  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Before you sit down to play\
  \ a tabletop RPG like Pathfinder or Starfinder, you need a character. I mean, sure,\
  \ you could play one of our nifty pregenerated characters for a while. But sooner\
  \ or later, you’re gonna want to let your own imagination roam, making characters\
  \ that help you tell the stories you want to be part of. But where to start? Here\
  \ are four sources of inspiration that work well for me and other people I’ve played\
  \ with.</p> \n     <ol> \n      <li><b>Inspiration from Media</b>: Who are your\
  \ favorite characters in books, movies, TV shows, video games, comics, etc. and\
  \ why do you like them so much? Is it their attitude? Their personality? Their style\
  \ and flair? Their aesthetic? The way they approach challenges? Thinking about why\
  \ you like certain characters is a useful springboard to come up with characters\
  \ that capture the fun of an idea without directly copying them. The characters\
  \ you use as sources could come from modern works or from traditional legends. <br>\
  \ You might want to play a character based off a general archetype that appears\
  \ in many stories, like an absentminded detective, a wise sage, or a master archer.\
  \ Inspiration can also arise from arts of all sorts that aren’t tied directly to\
  \ a specific narrative, such as drawings, paintings, clothing, and music.</li> \n\
  \      <br> \n      <li><b>Inspiration from Lore</b>: More specifically, the setting\
  \ lore information in Pathfinder and Starfinder books is designed to help you and\
  \ your GM build fully realized characters that have a place in the game world. Knowing\
  \ information about the setting helps inspire answers to key questions about your\
  \ character’s history and motivations. Where did your character grow up? What is\
  \ their personal philosophy, and how does that compare to the philosophies of others\
  \ around them? What are their formative experiences? Which organizations they are\
  \ affiliated with? What are their goals, and how do they plan to achieve them?</li>\
  \ \n      <br> \n      <li><b>Inspiration from Mechanics</b>: This could be as straightforward\
  \ as wanting to play a character that fills a particular role in the party. Perhaps\
  \ you want to play a strong character that deals a lot of damage, or a character\
  \ who is a master of noticing dangers of all kinds. Maybe you want to try out a\
  \ new character class you haven’t played yet. Or maybe you’ve found a combination\
  \ of rules that lets you express a new idea. Pathfinder and Starfinder are chock-full\
  \ of mechanics that interact in all sorts of interesting ways. There are so many\
  \ ways to mix and match the rules, so look for mechanics that fit your play style.</li>\
  \ \n      <br> \n      <li><b>Inspiration from Players</b>: I’ve found that the\
  \ best ideas are ones that draw on the creativity of more than one person. Consider\
  \ making characters that have connections to other player’s PCs and collaborating\
  \ on backstory elements. You can also use what you see other players doing to help\
  \ fill in the blanks of your character’s story. </li> \n     </ol> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/cf448523-b607-4753-b0e8-cc29ce6350e2/091020_Leshy.png\"\

  ></p> \n     <p>Once you have identified points of inspiration, you can start chaining\
  \ them together. Here are a couple examples of my character creation process. The\
  \ first is my first PFS character, Trade Princess Natani Copperlock.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>\"Well, I haven't really played this Pathfinder system yet, but rogues don't\
  \ have spells, so they're probably easier to throw together quickly before the next\
  \ convention slot. A treasure-loving halfling's a pretty classic archetype for a\
  \ rogue, so let's go with that. Always looking to prove herself...where in this\
  \ new setting book do they like money...how about Druma? If she was poor during\
  \ her childhood in Druma, that would have a particular impact on her worldview.\
  \ And the Qadira faction likes money too, so maybe she wants to establish herself\
  \ through trade and diplomacy, but isn't above ‘liberating’ goods from their former\
  \ owners to help gain an advantage.\" </p> \n     <p>My most recent one that is\
  \ more than an amorphous blob of GM credit, Kragrak, with leshy companion Oak Sprout\
  \ followed the same process.</p> \n     <p>\"Leshys are awesome, and I want one\
  \ to basically be my character in social situations. How about a taciturn leshy\
  \ warden druid with a gregarious leshy companion? And to give the warden some plant\
  \ theming despite not being a plant, well, plants grow into ground, so how about\
  \ an oread with little cacti sprouting out of his shoulders? He uses them to fasten\
  \ his cloak. And with cactus-shoulders, he probably grew up in a location with deserts...what\
  \ if he was raised among the Pahmet dwarves of Osirion? Middle-aged oreads often\
  \ feel an irresistible pull to travel, which would be a great reason to leave his\
  \ comfort zone as a member of a relatively insular culture and seek membership in\
  \ an organization like the Pathfinder Society.\" </p> \n     <br clear=\"all\">\
  \ \n     <p>I’ve shared a couple of my character seeds. What are your favorite sources\
  \ of inspiration for character building? Do you have tons of character ideas you’\
  d love to play, but there’s never enough time to play them all? Please share your\
  \ thoughts and ideas in the comments below.</p> \n     <p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\
