  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">I\
  \ don't know what the weather's like where you live, but I'm looking out my office\
  \ window at a gorgeous, sunny 71-degree day that feels a lot like summer. The forecast\
  \ calls for rain this weekend, but after two beautiful Spring weeks on vacation\
  \ in France and the sun beating down on me for five days in a row here in Seattle\
  \ (!), I'm ready to declare the end of the winter season for real!</span></p> \n\
  \    <p>That's convenient, because today also marks the final preview blog for <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy92s9\">Pathfinder Battles: Reign of Winter</a>, the newest\
  \ set of prepainted fantasy miniatures from Paizo and WizKids! The set supports\
  \ our popular <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/reignOfWinter\">Reign of Winter\
  \ Adventure Path</a>, which puts the player characters in Baba Yaga's Dancing Hut\
  \ as they venture across the worlds. That's given us the opportunity to include\
  \ more weird monsters than in any previous set. And we have three left to reveal\
  \ today!</p> \n    <p>Before we do so, however, I should deliver the news that the\
  \ official release date for the <a href=\"/products/btpy92s9\">Reign of Winter</a>\
  \ set has shifted back a bit due to international shipping from the factory. WizKids\
  \ now has the set slated at a June 4 release. I do not expect that date to change\
  \ again.</p> \n    <p>And now, on to the last three miniatures!</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>First up this week is the Centaur Scout, a great\
  \ “troop builder” type of figure that works perfectly for a rank-and-file centaur.\
  \ He comes from <a href=\"/products/btpy8xbz\">Pathfinder Adventure Path: Maiden,\
  \ Mother, Crone</a>, and works great in encounters with the set's other centaur,\
  \ the <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lfrw\">Centaur Archer</a>. The Centaur Scout\
  \ is a Large, uncommon figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\

  /image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71459_NosferatuBrother_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Brandon Hodge's adventure <a href=\"/products/btpy8yv5\"\
  >Rasputin Must Die!</a> is the gift that keeps on giving as far as this set is concerned.\
  \ Not only did it include a madcap concept that's come to define the world-hopping\
  \ weirdness of entire <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/reignOfWinter\">Adventure\
  \ Path</a>, but it also included a ton of really great character and monster images\
  \ that just begged to be turned into miniatures. This guy—a Russian vampire priest,\
  \ basically—is one of my absolute favorites. WizKids did a great job on the figure's\
  \ sunken eyes, which really jump out from what's otherwise a pretty simply painted\
  \ figure. In the adventure, the Nosferatu Brother is one of three, which in part\
  \ justifies his uncommon rarity. The Nosferatu Brother is a Medium figure.</p> \n\
  \    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71459_Zorka_500.jpeg\"\
  > <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71459_Zorka_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"> </a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Last up this week (and for the entire set!) is Zorka,\
  \ a strange fey creature known as a kikimora. Kikimoras are house spirits, and this\
  \ particular one inhabits Baba Yaga's Dancing Hut, where she serves as housekeeper.\
  \ The look of this figure was simply too insane not to include, especially since\
  \ folks have been asking for more fey. Definitely one of the weirdest monsters we've\
  \ published, let alone made a miniature of, Zorka is a Medium, rare figure.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>And that's it for the Reign of Winter set! Tune in next week for the\
  \ big reveal of the next set, as well as a look at some of its coolest miniatures.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Please consider setting up an <a href=\"/products/btpy8o6b\">ongoing\
  \ Pathfinder Battles Case Subscription</a> to make sure that you don't miss a single\
  \ figure. We've recently revised the discounts and benefits offered to subscribers,\
  \ so I'm certain you'll find it worthwhile to see if it makes sense for you and\
  \ your collection.</p> \n    <p>See you next week!</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br \\\
