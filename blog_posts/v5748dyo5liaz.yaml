  \ at Paizo yesterday, but looking at the calendar I've worked here 11 weeks. What\
  \ a busy time! Lots of things going on! Thought I would take a moment and give a\
  \ status update on several of the projects I've worked on over the past three months.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The Venture-Officer team saw reorganization with the addition of the\
  \ Regional Venture-Coordinators and Venture-Agents. While I've been posting about\
  \ the promotions and resignations of Venture-Captains and Venture-Lieutenants, I\
  \ haven't said much about the others. The Regional Venture-Coordinators' jumped\
  \ in with both feet and are working hard to get a handle on PFS in their areas and\
  \ increase communication with the Venture Team. Positives in my book!</p> \n   \
  \ <div class=\"blurb180\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PFS-Desk.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PFS-Desk_180.jpeg\"></a>\n    </div>\
  \ \n    <p>So far, I've processed the applications of 66 new Venture-Agents and\
  \ have another 60ish to process early this week. If the stars align and the winds\
  \ are right, the 120ish new agents will join the team at the New Year. Their main\
  \ task involves bringing events to venues near you, spreading the goodness that\
  \ is PFS. If you know of a venue that could host PFS, but isn't, find <a href=\"\
  /pathfinderSociety/about/regionalCoordinators\">your local Venture Officer on our\
  \ roster</a> and let them know!</p> \n    <p>Besides the Venture-Officer reorganization,\
  \ I'm working with the team on another initiative. Charity resides near and dear\
  \ to my heart. While a Venture-Lieutenant, I co-founded CrispyCon, with Venture-Lieutenant\
  \ Carol Tierney. All of the profits from CrispyCon went to charity. Over the years,\
  \ we supported the British Polio Foundation, the Peterborough Neo-Natal Unit, and\
  \ Sarcoma UK, to name a few. When I left the UK, Carol and Venture-Captain Chris\
  \ Brockley Blatt morphed CrispyCon into 3XP and continued the charity tradition.\
  \ This November, they raised £1295 for the Red Cross, SANE, and TOFS. In this spirit\
  \ of charity, in 2016, we are adding two boons to the rotation. These boons are\
  \ specifically to aid in raising funds for established charities. There are a few\
  \ criteria, of course, that the Venture-Officers will confirm before submitting\
  \ their convention information. If you feel your convention qualifies, contact your\
  \ local Venture-Officer to participate.</p> \n    <p>Speaking of boons. Currently,\
  \ most boons reach players hands at conventions. The PFS team discussed the forum\
  \ posts where players noted they couldn't always attend cons, put our heads together,\
  \ and came up with a few new programs. The first is a Welcome to the Society boon\
  \ for new players and is for a person's XXXXX-1 character. We designed the boon\
  \ with an eye to surviving those first scenarios while learning the ropes. We also\
  \ added GameDay boons to the mix, designed to bridge the gap between weekly sessions\
  \ and conventions. Right now, I tasked the Regional Venture-Coordinators to identify\
  \ GameDays in their regions, so that we can distribute support worldwide. I'll publish\
  \ more information on the GameDay program in the upcoming weeks.</p> \n    <p>Boons\
  \ are to the Roleplay Guild as Rewards are to the Adventure Card Guild. I'm working\
  \ with Tanis on similar benefits for new Card Guildies. Several Convention Rewards\
  \ exist and will make their way to Conventions and GameDays near you offering Adventure\
  \ Card Guild play.</p> \n    <p>These aren't the only tasks I've worked on over\
  \ the past 11 weeks, but I need to keep something up my sleeve for future blogs.\
  \ One hint—get your paintbrushes and glue guns ready!</p> \n    <p>Until next time—\
  Explore, Report, Cooperate!</p> \n    <p>Tonya Woldridge<br> <i>Organized Play Coordinator</i></p>\
