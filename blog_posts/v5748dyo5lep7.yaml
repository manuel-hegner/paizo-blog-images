  \ When I Was Growing Up...</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Thursday, April 25, 2013</p>\
  \ \n   <p><span itemprop=\"description\">In about a month, <a href=\"/products/btpy8vdl\"\
  ><i>Ultimate Campaign</i></a> will arrive in stores and your mailbox, helping both\
  \ players and Game Masters add a wealth of new detail and exciting new rules to\
  \ their game. Every week from now until launch, we will be previewing parts of this\
  \ book to show you what it has in store!</span></p> \n   <p><i>Ultimate Campaign</i>\
  \ is divided up into four meaty chapters, each one focusing on a different part\
  \ of your game. The first chapter is devoted to characters and their backstories,\
  \ giving you a system for determining what happened to your character before the\
  \ campaign got underway. With over 50 tables in this book, this system is designed\
  \ so that you can roll randomly to determine your backstory if you prefer, based\
  \ upon a number of simple character decisions, such as race and class. Alternatively,\
  \ you can just pick the background that best suits your character.</p> \n   <p>The\
  \ results of these tables determine what options you have in selecting your starting\
  \ traits, which are greatly expanded in this chapter. In addition, some of the backgrounds\
  \ might qualify you for an exciting new type of feat, the story feat. These special\
  \ feats can only be taken if your character meets specific story prerequisites.\
  \ While they give you a simple bonus at first, the feat itself improves if you accomplish\
  \ an in-game goal. You can only have one such feat at a time, until you complete\
  \ the goal of that feat, at which point you can select another one if you qualify.\
  \ Take a look at this example.</p> \n   <blockquote> \n    <h2>Arisen (Story)</h2>\
  \ \n    <p>Escaping death strengthened your bond to life, but fills you with a need\
  \ for answers.</p> \n    <p><b>Prerequisite:</b> You must have been slain and brought\
  \ back from the dead, or have the Left to Die or Cursed Birth background.<br> <b>Benefit:</b>\
  \ You don’t die until your negative hit point total is equal to or greater than\
  \ 4 + your Constitution score. Once per day as a standard action, you can force\
  \ yourself to carry on by strength of will alone, gaining 1 temporary hit point\
  \ per hit die. These temporary hit points last for 10 minutes.<br> <b>Normal:</b>\
  \ You die when your negative hit point total is equal to or greater than your Constitution\
  \ score.<br> <b>Goal:</b> You meet in person and hear the words of your deity or\
  \ your deity’s chosen herald. If you worship a pantheon of deities, you must meet\
  \ and hear a member of that pantheon—a herald does not suffice in this case. If\
  \ you worship no specific deity, you must hear the words of an appropriate entity\
  \ of the GM’s choice.<br> <b>Completion Benefit:</b> You gain a +2 bonus on saving\
  \ throws against death effects and fear effects. In addition, the caster level of\
  \ any conjuration (healing) spell that is cast on you increases by 1 for the purposes\
  \ of its effects on you alone.</p> \n   </blockquote> \n   <p>That about wraps up\
  \ the first preview for <a href=\"/products/btpy8vdl\"><i>Ultimate Campaign</i></a>.\
  \ Come back next week for a peek into what our iconics do between adventures!</p>\
