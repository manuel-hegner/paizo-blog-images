  >Patross, the staff lead, was sneering again, and Ivy knew that would soon cause\
  \ trouble for her. The waitress didn't even need to look to know what had offended\
  \ the surly man. The two guests that sat by the dock-side windows—prime seats of\
  \ the establishment, Patross would protest!—stood out enough from the regular crowd.\
  \ It was an open question on what about them offended the most. The woman's clothing\
  \ was too shabby, the man's clothing was too foreign. The woman was vicious and\
  \ unpleasant. Truthfully, Ivy thought that Patross was most upset that the pair\
  \ were both old, and the woman incredibly ugly.</p>\n              <p>He couldn't\
  \ say anything about that, it would upset Taldan decorum. So Patross sneered and\
  \ settled on, “Setting that filthy chicken on the table. As if she thought this\
  \ place was a barn!”</p>\n              <p>As if other guests didn't bring their\
  \ dogs into the tavern all the time, throwing their grimy leftover bones on the\
  \ floor for the pets to chew on. Ivy would have rolled her eyes, if she didn't know\
  \ what was coming next for her. She kept her gaze down on the floor and clutched\
  \ her serving plate to her chest, willing herself to become invisible. If she could\
  \ just slip under the man's notice, maybe he'd just complain and then leave it alone—\
  </p>\n              <p>“Ivy!” Patross barked, and the poor waitress felt a cold\
  \ shudder roll up her shoulders despite the fact she'd been expecting it. “Tell\
  \ that woman to either take that louse-ridden bird out, or take herself out instead!”\
  </p>\n              <p><em>Coward</em>, Ivy thought.</p>\n              <p>She moved\
  \ as slowly as possible, dragging each step with a sense of building dread, but\
  \ with Patross' eyes on her she couldn't draw her walk out forever. The more that\
  \ Ivy could see of the old woman, the more terrified Ivy became. Maybe it was simply\
  \ because the old hag was so hideous—Ivy didn't like to think she was so shallow,\
  \ but what else was there? She'd dealt with far less pleasant drunks nearly every\
  \ shift. The woman's teeth glinted like iron, but Ivy had seen gaudier dentures\
  \ before, some made of far less pleasant materials. The woman was glaring at Ivy\
  \ long before the girl reached the table, sniffing as if she could suck the waitress\
  \ in through her nose. The price of dragging it out as she had; that always made\
  \ things worse!</p>\n              <p>“Well?” the old woman snapped, and Ivy fought\
  \ down another deep shudder. “What is it, child? Did you burn your tongue off? Spit\
  \ out what you want or leave me to my tea!”</p>\n              <p>Ivy swallowed\
  \ deeply, glad that her serving plate could hide the sweat on her palms. “Madam...”\
  \ she said, mind racing on what to say, before she settled on something potentially\
  \ inoffensive. “Would you like me to care for your chicken, while you are here?”\
  </p>\n              <p>The woman sniffed heavily again, this time thoughtfully.\
  \ “Careful with your words, are you? Yes, take care of my chicken. If you're a good\
  \ girl and treat it well, I'll give you a gift and let you go free.”</p>\n     \
  \         <p>“Stop tormenting the young woman,” the elderly man chastised. Ivy had\
  \ nearly forgotten he was there, too focused on his horrible companion. He had dark\
  \ skin, not too unusual in Taldor—plenty of families from Mwangi had come to Taldor\
  \ with the returning Armies of Exploration—but none of those people wore clothing\
  \ like his. He continued, “Pay your grandmother no mind, Ivy. Nor your staff lead,\
  \ for that matter.”</p>\n              <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n           \

  \ must have overheard my name,</em> Ivy thought, because she didn't like to think\
  \ of any alternatives. She wasn't sure what to say now, so she said nothing.</p>\n\
  \              <p>“A shy little bit like that must be pushed, or she'll never amount\
  \ to anything,” the 'grandmother' complained. “Look at her, shoved around by quarrelsome\
  \ women and grubby men. She'd be better off as a ham on a plate.”</p>\n        \
  \      <p>“Isn't that right?” she said, suddenly snapping her attention back to\
  \ Ivy. “You'd leap at any chance to get out of here, wouldn't you, child? Even one\
  \ as horrible as I?”</p>\n              <p>Ivy wanted to. Ivy wanted to escape this\
  \ miserable, harassment-filled drudgery more than anything. But Ivy had been raised\
  \ on old tales of careless fools, and had learned well in Taldor to be cautious\
  \ of windfalls, and so she took a step back and gave a short shake of her head.</p>\n\
  \              <p>“Plenty of 'shy young bits' grow up without <em>you</em> to threaten\
  \ them,” the man scoffed at his companion. “Or do you think you're so important?”\
  </p>\n              <p>“Of <em>course</em> I'm important,” 'grandmother' cackled.</p>\n\
  \              <p>“Oh? Care to wager?” the man asked.</p>\n              <p></p>\n\
  \              <p>The pair glanced at Ivy again, something unspoken passing between\
  \ them. The old woman shook her head, picking up her chicken under one arm. “A waste,”\
  \ she grumbled, with no further explanation, and hustled out of the tavern door.\
  \ Both Ivy and the old man watched her go.</p>\n              <p>“You're wise to\
  \ avoid suspicious gifts, and wiser still not to look toward someone else to save\
  \ you,” the man said, after a moment. “But will you be able to live with the curiosity\
  \ of what would have happened, if you had said yes?”</p>\n              <p>“Well,\
  \ I'll have to, sir,” Ivy said, slipping easily back into her pleasant server persona\
  \ now that the woman was gone. “Thank you for your patronage.”</p>\n           \
  \   <p>The old man nodded, or perhaps it was a small bow, before he picked up his\
  \ leopard-headed staff, paid the bill, and left. Ivy blew out a sign of relief,\
  \ glad the situation had resolved itself without a confrontation. Patross couldn't\
  \ yell at her for failing now... at least, not much. The waitress moved to clean\
  \ up the dishes on the table, noting the silver and glass tea mugs weren't anything\
  \ she'd seen used at the Dancing Dolphin before. Moving one of the cups onto her\
  \ tray, she noticed a brilliant red and gold egg sitting behind it. It looked the\
  \ size of a regular hen's egg, but it glittered with real gold, and something strange\
  \ and powerful hummed beneath Ivy's fingertips when she touched it.</p>\n      \
  \        <p><em>This is not safe</em>, Ivy thought to herself, for she was no fool.\
  \ She looked out the window, but could see no sign of the old hag or her friend.\
  \ Was this some kind of test? The smartest thing to do was leave the egg there,\
  \ or perhaps give it to Patross and see what happened. But she thought back to the\
  \ old man's words... <em>will you be able to live with the curiosity of what would\
  \ have happened, if you leave it be?</em></p>\n              <p>Ivy picked up the\
  \ Fabergé egg, slipping it into the pocket of her waitress' apron...</p>\n     \
