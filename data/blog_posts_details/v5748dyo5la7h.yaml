  artist: "their new monstrous neighbors, and the king's own homicidal outbursts of\
    \ rage over both. Merlokrep is always happy to offer visitors an honored place\
    \ as Great Sacrifices to the Crown, ready to wine and dine them before ripping\
    \ them open and pulling out their hearts"

  artist: "many \"He Who Forgets More Than You or He Knows,\" is the Truescale's shaman.\
    \ His mysterious prophecies are taken very seriously by the rest of the tribe,\
    \ at least when he is awake. Jekkajak is a walking corpse of a kobold, whose withered\
    \ old white scales are stretched tight over bone. His puny skeletal snout contains\
    \ a lone tooth and constantly dribbles drool. His milky eyes focus intermittently\
    \ on his surroundings"
