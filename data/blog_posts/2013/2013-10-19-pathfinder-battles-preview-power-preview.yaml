              <p class="date">Friday, October 18, 2013</p>
              <div itemprop="articleBody">
               <p></p>
               <p><span itemprop="description">This week sees the official release of the <a href="/products/btpy909j">Legends of Golarion</a> set of <a href="/pathfinderbattles">Pathfinder Battles</a> prepainted plastic figures, and I couldn't be more excited. This set is extra special to me, because unlike previous sets, it takes its inspiration not from one of our <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath">Pathfinder Adventure Path</a> campaigns, but instead from the whole breadth of all Pathfinder releases to date. This set, more than any of its predecessors, includes lots of original Pathfinder creatures like the <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lf4k">Sandpoint Devil</a>, <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lf4k">Seugathi</a>, and <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lfcr">Marsh Giant</a>.</span></p>
               <p>Due to an ill-timed vacation on my selfish behalf, the world was left without a <a href="/pathfinderbattles">Pathfinder Battles</a> preview last week, and I felt the reverberations and gnashing of teeth all the way across the country on the floor of New York Comic Con. So as penance for my breach of etiquette, I feel the only remedy is to preview ALL FIFTEEN remaining figures from <a href="/products/btpy909j">Legends of Golarion</a>, from the lowest mooks to the mightiest demons!</p>
               <p>We have a ton to cover today, so let's get started!</p>
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK71244-8-07.jpg"><img src="/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK71244-8-07_180.jpeg" border="0"></a>
               </div>
               <p>Up first we have the Tooth Gang Knifer, a masked street thug from the cover of the <a href="/products/btpy86j8">Guide to Absalom</a> sourcebook on the city at the center of the Pathfinder Campaign Setting. I've long wanted to add some thugs to the <a href="/pathfinderbattles">Pathfinder Battles</a> line, and this guy fit the bill perfectly. He's got a simple, dark paint scheme fitting with his common rarity, but also fitting with the fact that the only money he has to spend on clothes he intends to steal from the purses of dead player characters. The Tooth Gang Knifer is a Medium common figure, and he is not alone…</p>
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK71244-8-08.jpg"><img src="/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK71244-8-08_180.jpeg" border="0"></a>
               </div>
               <p>I like this guy even better. Here we have the Tooth Gang Brute, positioned mid-scream with a big old club he plans to use to see what the inside of someone's head looks like. He is garbed similarly to his companion in the Tooth Gang, and both wear a tooth on a necklace, identifying their allegiance. The Tooth Gang Brute is a Medium, common figure.</p>
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK71244-8-09.jpg"><img src="/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK71244-8-09_180.jpeg" border="0"></a>
               </div>
               <p>Next up we have the Akata, inspired by the classic <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/secondDarkness">Second Darkness Adventure Path</a> adventure <a href="/products/btpy85ed">"Children of the Void,"</a>wherein threats from outer space make themselves known on the world of Golarion. Akatas live on dying planets, asteroids, and even comets, terrorizing the galaxy as only blue space lions with two tails can. (They also dwell, of course, in <a href="/products/btpy8hif">Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2</a>!)</p>
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK71244-8-12.jpg"><img src="/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK71244-8-12_180.jpeg" border="0"></a>
               </div>
               <p>And while <a href="/products/btpy909j">Legends of Golarion</a> gives us the opportunity to focus on purely Golarion creatures like the Akata and certain NPCs, it's also a chance for us to fill out the ranks of common creatures and adversaries, and it's difficult to find creatures more common or more adversarial than orcs! Here we have a great Orc Archer. The detail on the sculpt is really fantastic for a figure at the common rarity, and you can combine your Orc Archers with other orcs in this set and those in <a href="/products/btpy8mq6">Heroes &amp; Monsters</a> to build a huge orc warband! The Orc Archer is a Medium, common figure.</p>
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK71244-8-13.jpg"><img src="/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK71244-8-13_180.jpeg" border="0"></a>
               </div>
               <p>That orc warband is going to need a lot of rank and file troopers. Might I suggest the Orc Soldier? This handsome devil comes complete with his own sword and armor. Just provide the player characters and let him do his dirty work. The Orc Soldier is a Medium, common figure.</p>
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK71244-8-14.jpg"><img src="/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK71244-8-14_180.jpeg" border="0"></a>
               </div>
               <p>Any good orc warband needs to have a lot of heart, and the Orc Mystic is only happy to provide, since he happens to be holding one in his bloody left hand! Looking at this figure I am again amazed at the sculpt quality WizKids is able to work into their common figures. The Mystic's screaming face and double-skull staff would look cool on a rare figure. The Orc Mystic is a Medium, common figure.</p>
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK71244-8-22.jpg"><img src="/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK71244-8-22_180.jpeg" border="0"></a>
               </div>
               <p>Back to Golarion, for a bit. Here we have the Eagle Knight, brave warrior of the goodly kingdom of Andoran, on the Inner Sea. Andoran is one of the most popular factions in the 55,000-player <a href="/pathfinderSociety">Pathfinder Society Organized Play</a> campaign, where Eagle Knights are a very important player organization. They've also played a role in the campaign setting since the very beginning. This female Eagle Knight wields a cool greatsword and wears the traditional colors of her order. The Eagle Knight is a Medium, uncommon figure.</p>
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK71244-8-23.jpg"><img src="/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK71244-8-23_180.jpeg" border="0"></a>
               </div>
               <p>This Eagle Knight Officer makes the perfect companion for the Eagle Knight. He has a great mid-swing pose and a cool ponytail. The Eagle Knight Officer is a Medium, uncommon figure.</p>
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK71244-8-24.jpg"><img src="/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK71244-8-24_180.jpeg" border="0"></a>
               </div>
               <p>This scummy aquatic humanoid comes from the most prolific and successful of the countless races created by ancient aberrations who once ruled the world. The Ulat-Kini makes a great stand-in for any sort of subterranean or aquatic lurker. The figure has surprising paint gradients and details for its rarity, and is one of my favorite "rank and file" figures in the set. The Ulat-Kini is an uncommon, Medium figure.</p>
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK71244-8-26.jpg"><img src="/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK71244-8-26_180.jpeg" border="0"></a>
               </div>
               <p>This Snow Leopard is a perfect match for Droogami, the animal companion of the iconic druid Lini (who also appears in this set). It also makes a good generic great cat figure, with or without its gnomish partner. The Snow Leopard is a Medium, uncommon figure.</p>
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/product/catalog/WZK//WZK71244-8-27.jpg"><img src="/image/product/catalog/WZK//WZK71244-8-27_180.jpeg" border="0"></a>
               </div>
               <p>Golarion has many heroes, but few have such a strong claim to that title as the Knights of Ozem, ancient protectors of Lastwall and outright enemies of evil in all its forms. This female Knight of Ozem wears beautiful golden full plate and rushes toward enemies with a longsword held aloft and a mighty shield ready to defend her from certain doom. With a heroic pose and a paint scheme that screams "I'm a paladin," this figure makes a great proxy for a heroic player character, as well. The Knight of Ozem is a Medium, uncommon figure.</p>
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK71244-8-32.jpg"> <img src="/image/product/catalog/WZK/WZK71244-8-32_180.jpeg" border="0"> </a>
               </div>
               <p>The imposing Calikang comes straight from the pages of the <a href="/products/btpy8ief">Inner Sea World Guide</a>. Legend holds that, an untold number of eons ago, one of the thousand deities of distant Vudra failed at a task, and the first calikangs were born from that god's severed fingers. They have a powerful sense of guilt and shame of their divine source's ancient failings, and they believe that if enough calikangs protect worldly holdings from robberies or destruction, this inherited sin will someday be wiped clean. That makes them awesome treasure guardians, and the fact that they're CR 12 makes them awesome enemies for your greedy PCs. The Calikang is a Large, uncommon figure.</p>
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-8-35a.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-8-35a_180.jpeg" border="0"></a>
               </div>
               <p>Here we have the croaking Toad Demon, a hideous creature that dwells in vast Abyssal swamps and waterways. Toad Demons prefer torture, slumber, and other lazy activities, but man, they pack a mean punch in a fight. The Toad Demon is a Large, uncommon figure. You'll want to stock up on a few of them before playing the <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/wrathOfTheRighteous">Wrath of the Righteous Adventure Path</a>, I imagine.</p>
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-8-36a.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-8-36a_180.jpeg" border="0"></a>
               </div>
               <p>Speaking of minis that will be helpful with the <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/wrathOfTheRighteous">Wrath of the Righteous Adventure Path</a>, this unusually colored Serpent Demon has six swords of different skymetal to kill you six different ways. She looks amazingly cool, and at the uncommon rarity she'll be a great encounter builder with other figures from the upcoming <a href="/products/btpy91pu">Wrath of the Righteous Pathfinder Battles</a> set. The Serpent Demon is a Large figure.</p>
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-8-37a.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-8-37a_180.jpeg" border="0"></a>
               </div>
               <p>This is probably my favorite figure in the entire set. Here we have the mature form of the Death Demon, creatively named the Greater Death Demon (you'll have to wait one set to get the junior version). I like pretty much everything about this figure, from the cool cross-armed forward-lunging pose to the blackfire weapons to the gradient paint job on its fleshy wings. Whatever you do, don't let it eat you! The Greater Death Demon is a (sweet-looking) Large, uncommon(!) figure.</p>
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-8-54a.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-8-54a_180.jpeg" border="0"></a>
               </div>
               <p>The last figure we'll preview today is the Fire Demon, an amazing adversary that dwells on the top of the normal demonic food chain. He's got a cool flaming whip sculpted in clear plastic and a neat face that took us something like 9 tries to get right. I'm very happy with this figure, and hope you will be too! The Fire Demon is a Large, rare figure.</p>
               <p>And THAT'S IT for the <a href="/products/btpy909j">Legends of Golarion</a> set. We've got a ton of figures from upcoming sets to preview in future weeks, so be sure to come back next Friday for absolutely 100% new figures no one outside the office or the factory has ever seen before.</p>
               <p>Until then, please consider setting up an <a href="/products/btpy8o6b">Ongoing Pathfinder Battles Case Subscription</a>. This option is the best way to make sure you don't miss a single figure, and comes with great discounts on Encounter Packs and single figure purchases!</p>
               <p>Or, check out the new <a href="/pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids/singles/legendsOfGolarion">Legends of Golarion Singles</a> we've just put on sale and pick your figures one at a time.</p>
               <p>And after revealing fifteen figures, I'm exhausted and need another vacation! See you next week!</p>
