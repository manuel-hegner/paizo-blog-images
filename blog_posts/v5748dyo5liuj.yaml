  \ time last week, the Paizo staff were wrapping up PaizoCon, participating in the\
  \ last few panels, running a final delve, or rolling dice in the final encounters.\
  \ A huge thank you to all those that lent their hands with setup, tear down, or\
  \ the myriad of tasks in-between. PFS could not have had such a successful show\
  \ without your assistance. I appreciate the efforts of all our volunteers on behalf\
  \ of the Society. While John covered the highlights from the banquet, I've got a\
  \ few other PaizoCon related pieces of business.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ Service Coins</h2> \n     <p>Over the course of the weekend, I gave out four coins,\
  \ three in person and one in abstentia. For those at the convention, I visited the\
  \ table the recipient was at and said a few words about why they received the coin.\
  \ To watch the face of the recipient while I spoke of the hours of time they dedicated\
  \ to our game and their effect on the Society was truly humbling. It seemed to affect\
  \ the players seated at the tables, knowing they were witnessing something special.\
  \ While sometimes I am unable to visit the recipient and give the coin in person,\
  \ I hope to award most of them the way I did this weekend.</p> \n     <p>Without\
  \ further ado, your newest Campaign Service Coin awardees:</p> \n     <ul>\n   \
  \   <li>Ray Diaz, VC Metro Boston—#755</li> \n      <li>Dave Montgomery, VC Central/West\
  \ Massachusettes—#756</li> \n      <li>\"Pirate\" Rob Hetherington—#757</li> \n\
  \      <li>Jesse Davis, VC Online—#758</li>\n     </ul> \n     <h2>Trivia Contest</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>Saturday night, John Compton hosted a Trivia Contest, assisted by Mark\
  \ Seifter and Linda Zayas-Palmer. I missed the beginning, but was there for the\
  \ rousing finale. A number of 8-person teams sought the title of Champion. They\
  \ all had interesting names—Asmodeus's Chamberpot, the Boston Mafia, Abrogail's\
  \ Kittens, to name a few. Two really stood out in my mind. The first was Rovagug's\
  \ Witness, whom almost made me choke on my soda with their group call of \"Witness\"\
  \ anytime they were called on. They also had a pamphlet they shared with me on the\
  \ delights of worshipping Rovagug. The second team was John Compton's Sons. Unfortunately,\
  \ the pictorial evidence turned out blurry and not suitable for print, but those\
  \ fine people calling John \"papa\" are:</p> \n     <ul>\n      <li>Del Collins</li>\
  \ \n      <li>Bob Jonquet</li> \n      <li>Matt Polkowsky</li> \n      <li>Jim Page</li>\
  \ \n      <li>Rafael Taramona</li> \n      <li>Anthony Bowen</li> \n      <li>Raymond\
  \ Sullivan</li> \n      <li>Joshua \"Trivia Savant\" Herrington</li>\n     </ul>\
  \ \n     <p>John Compton's Sons won the tournament with a perfect final round, securing\
  \ the title of Trivia Champs. They say they will be back next year, bigger and badder\
  \ than ever, as John Compton's Grandsons, ready to defend their title. I highly\
  \ encourage PaizoCon attendees to come out and enjoy the show, even if you don't\
  \ want to participate in the trivia portion.</p> \n     <h2>5 Star GMs</h2> \n \
  \    <p>Thursday at PaizoCon, we had two people reach their fifth star. Thanks to\
  \ Jon Dehning, we celebrated with cake! So I can attest the cake is not a lie :D\
  \ In addition, over the past month, several other stalwart GMs braved the gauntlet\
  \ of 150 games and 10 specials to achieve their fifth star. Please join me in congratulating:</p>\
  \ \n     <ul>\n      <li>David Shaw</li> \n      <li>Mike Venditti</li> \n     \
  \ <li>Paul Holtom</li> \n      <li>Davey Silon</li> \n      <li>Sean Wellsmore</li>\
  \ \n      <li>Russ Brown</li> \n      <li>Jean-Marc Comeau</li>\n     </ul> \n \

  \     </div> \n     <h2>Travel Log</h2> \n     <p>Now that PaizoCon is past, we\
  \ can turn our sights to upcoming events. I'll be attending Origins Game Faire in\
  \ Columbus, Ohio, from June 15-20 and the American Library Association Annual Conference\
  \ in Orlando, Florida, from June 23-28. After that, a few weeks in Seattle to get\
  \ things packed for Gen Con, then I'm off to the United Kingdom the latter part\
  \ of July for PaizoCon UK . After the convention, I'm taking a few days to visit\
  \ friends and tour a few historical sites, because who can pass up the chance to\
  \ visit castles? Then back to Indianapolis for Gen Con from August 3-7. If the cards\
  \ fall right, I will be helping my husband move from Canada to Las Vegas (just a\
  \ bit of a climate change there) post-Gen Con, but will be back in the office in\
  \ time for PAX West. Whew!</p> \n     <p>The TL;DR of the above is that I am going\
  \ to be out of the office quite a bit starting next week. If you have conventions\
  \ coming up between now and September, please submit your information sooner than\
  \ later. I have the fantastic Customer Support Team backing me up on con support\
  \ processing, but we still need time to get things through the system. Please help\
  \ me help you!</p> \n     <p>Many other conventions ran this past weekend. How many\
  \ of you got in a game (or two or six)? What games did you play? Enquiring minds\
  \ want to know! </p>\n     <p>Until next time—Explore, Report, Cooperate!</p> \n\
  \     <p>Tonya Woldridge<br> <i>Organized Play Coordinator</i></p> \n     <p><b>Character\
  \ Sketch Competition Update!</b> Our awesome Community Team—Chris and Liz—are prepping\
  \ the character sketch submissions for judging. Once they are ready, they will open\
  \ voting to our community. Thank you to everyone who submitted a sketch!</p> \n\
