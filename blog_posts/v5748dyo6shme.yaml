  \ flying in various directions before appearing to grow bored and unceremoniously\
  \ departing. Many adventurers swear that the monstrous felines simply enjoy wreaking\

  \ some reports describe the psstpsstmitl snatching provisions to eat after growing\

  \ centaur in the middle of this fancy dinner party in idk the Darklands or whatever?\

  \ are inhospitable places at the best of times, but the floolf is one such creature\
  \ that has adapted to life in this most forbidding of landscapes. Their dense, long\
  \ fur makes them appear extremely fluffy, which keeps their body temperatures well\
  \ regulated. Like the chinchilla, floolves are hunted for their fur, but unlike\
  \ the small rodent, floolves are considerably dangerous. Many an opportunistic soul\
  \ has attempted to get rich quick by hunting and trapping floolves for their pelts,\
  \ but such ventures rarely end in anything but a bonus snack for a hungry pack.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>While floolves are highly social creatures, it is not unheard of\
  \ for individuals to wander away from the pack for short periods of time. They are\
  \ known for being highly defensive, swiftly and viciously attacking whatever they\
  \ view as a threat. However, there are tales of people, particularly the very young\
  \ or very old, who have become lost overnight near floolf territory and been approached\
  \ by a solitary floolf who will curl up around them until dawn breaks, then lead\
  \ them back to the nearest town or settlement.</p> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/8bad6653-480d-49f5-b86f-1c8de3ea4a7a/040121_Floolf.jpg\"\
