  \ it is to take away someone's sight in Pathfinder, few topics share the three 'C's\
  \ that make light and darkness such an important topic: Common, Crucial, and Confusing.\
  \ In this blog, I will thoroughly explain light and darkness, providing a detailed\
  \ example, so by the end, you will be armed and ready to run light and darkness\
  \ in your games, even the edgiest of edge cases. Lets start by covering a number\
  \ of important guidelines for dealing with light and darkness in your game.</p>\
  \ \n    <h3>1. Let There Be Light</h3> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\">\n     <a href=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderAdventurePath/PZO9045-Werewolves.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderAdventurePath/PZO9045-Werewolves_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Illustration by Craig J Spearing</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>In\
  \ the absence of darkness magic, light magic is fairly straightforward. Without\
  \ magic involved, there are four light levels: darkness, dim light, normal light,\
  \ and bright light. Each light spell tells you what light level it creates, and\
  \ in what radius. So that's not bad at all!</p> \n    <h3>2. What a Nice Ambience</h3>\
  \ \n    <p>Darkness magic by itself isn't too bad either, but it's harder to deal\
  \ with than light magic. Darkness spells first negate nonmagical light sources like\
  \ lanterns and sunrods, and then they tell you how many steps to reduce the \"ambient\"\
  \ light, and some of them can create a new fifth light level called supernatural\
  \ darkness below darkness, in which even darkvision is useless (but the devil/darkfolk\
  \ ability see in darkness still reigns supreme). However, there's one tricky nuance\
  \ in darkness magic, and that's the question \"what is ambient anyway?\" The <a\
  \ href=\"/paizo/faq/v5748nruor1fm#v5748eaic9ne9\">FAQ from October 2010</a> tells\
  \ us a little more: it defines ambient light as \"the light level from natural sources,\
  \ such as the sun, moon, and starsâ€”not torches, campfires, <i>light</i> spells,\
  \ and so on.\" This is a good start, but it leads into a debate about \"natural.\"\
  \ So here's the strongest rule of thumb for what kind of light is ambient, \"If\
  \ a creature is moving it around with them, it's almost never ambient, and if the\
  \ light is quite different in pockets instead of spread throughout an area uniformly,\
  \ it's probably not ambient (with exceptions for holes in the ceiling streaming\
  \ down sunlight in patches, for example).\" For example, in a Darklands cavern lit\
  \ by luminescent fungi, that light is ambient. If a svirfneblin plucked some of\
  \ the fungi and put them in a lantern-frame and carried them around, the light is\
  \ not ambient. If a svirfneblin took some seeds and grew a cavern of the fungi equivalent\
  \ to the first, it's ambient. Use your judgment, but with an eye towards most corner\
  \ cases not being ambient.</p> \n    <h3>3. And Ne'er the Two Shall Meet</h3> \n\
  \    <p>OK, we can do light, and we can do darkness. But what if the two of them\
  \ meet? There's quite a few interactions, including a special exception for the\
  \ spell <i>daylight</i>, so first let's focus on the basic interactions. From the\
  \ descriptors and the spells themselves, we glean the following facts: Spells with\
  \ the light descriptor only raise the light level within an area of a darkness descriptor\
  \ spell if they are higher level than the darkness descriptor spell. Apparently\
  \ also, darkness spells can counter or dispel light spells of equal or lower level\
  \ (and light spells can do the same to darkness spells). So what does that mean?</p>\
  \ \n    <h3>4. I Counter Your Counter!</h3> \n    <p>There are many ways to misinterpret\
  \ the \"counter or dispel\" text for light and darkness spells. Here's how that\
  \ particular rule actually works. To counter a spell of the opposing descriptor,\
  \ you ready an action just like any other counterspell. Just as normal for counterspell,\
  \ the target of the spell must be within range (which, without Reach Spell metamagic,\
  \ is touch for most light and darkness spells). If the target is in range, you automatically\
  \ counter the opposing spell and it has no effect, just like always for counterspell.\
  \ To dispel, you simply cast your spell on the same target (just like with <i>enlarge\
  \ person</i> and <i>reduce person</i>) and then they cancel each other out, leaving\
  \ no spell. Again, the range is usually touch and the target is the object that\
  \ radiates the darkness or light; you can't just touch an arbitrary spot within\
  \ the darkness or light.</p> \n    <h3>5. Pierce the Darkness</h3> \n    <p>Now\
  \ that we have those out of the way, let's assume the more typical case where someone\
  \ cast a darkness spell on one object, somebody else cast a light spell on another\
  \ object, and the areas overlap. We're still not dealing with <i>daylight</i> yet.\
  \ Based on the rules of light and darkness, here's how to adjudicate this situation\
  \ within the overlap:</p> \n    <p>First, the darkness spell turns off nonmagical\
  \ light sources and lowers the ambient light level. If there are multiple darkness\
  \ spells, figure out the highest spell level (not caster level!)</p> \n    <p>Next,\
  \ the light spells attempt to shine through. For every light spell, check to see\
  \ if it has a higher spell level (not caster level!) than the highest spell level\
  \ of any of the darkness spells. If so, that light spell has its normal effect,\
  \ as per the spell. Do not reduce its light level again for the darkness spell;\
  \ that already happened. This is true in all overlapping areas, as per <a href=\"\
  /paizo/faq/v5748nruor1fm#v5748eaic9qnn\">the May 2013 FAQ</a>, whether the light\
  \ spell's source object is within the area of darkness or not.</p> \n    <h3>6.\
  \ Here I Stand, in the Light of Day</h3> \n    <p>OK, so what about <i>daylight</i>?\
  \ We've been putting that one off until now because it simply doesn't work like\
  \ other light and darkness spells. As it says \"<i>Daylight</i> brought into an\
  \ area of magical darkness (or vice versa) is temporarily negated, so that the otherwise\
  \ prevailing light conditions exist in the overlapping areas of effect.\" <i>Daylight</i>\
  \ comes in, if necessary right after those last two bullet points in section 5:</p>\
  \ \n    <p>If no other light spell is sufficient to overcome the darkness spells\
  \ in the overlapping area, and if there is a <i>daylight</i> spell active in the\
  \ overlapping area, the <i>daylight</i> spell's special negation clause kicks in\
  \ (regardless of the spell level of <i>daylight</i> and the <i>darkness</i> spell;\
  \ it just works, always). This means that you negate all the magical light changes\
  \ in the area and bring it back to prevailing conditions. As a side effect of negating\
  \ the magical darkness, those nonmagical light sources activate again (while they\
  \ are not ambient, they were still part of prevailing conditions). Other magical\
  \ light sources still are not active in the area; they had their chance to attempt\
  \ to negate the darkness spells and didn't, so they were not part of the prevailing\
  \ light conditions, instead subsumed by <i>daylight</i>'s more powerful special\
  \ negation clause.</p> \n    <h3>7. Will Anyone Think of the Elves?</h3> \n    <p>So\
  \ what about low-light vision anyway? Those guys can see twice as far via light\
  \ sources. However, they don't change the actual radius of the magic at all. We'll\
  \ examine what that means for each step separately, using elves as an example instead\
  \ of always saying \"creatures with low-light vision\" all the time:</p> \n    <ul>\n\
  \     <li>In areas with light magic only, elves see twice as far. So with <i>daylight</i>,\
  \ elves get 120 feet of bright light followed by 120 feet of one step up from normal.</li>\
  \ \n     <li>In areas with darkness magic only, elves are affected by darkness spells\
  \ in the same region. Since darkness spells quench the effects of nonmagical light\
  \ sources before applying their reduction, elves should almost always be experiencing\
  \ the same light level as everyone else (if supposedly \"ambient\" light was dispersed\
  \ enough in pockets that the elf's low-light vision was giving it a different light\
  \ level, chances are the light wasn't ambient to begin with). In the rare cases\
  \ with odd pockets of ambient light, it is possible that an elf experiences a different\
  \ light level in the darkness spell due to the ambient light being different for\
  \ the elf.</li> \n     <li>In areas with both light and darkness magic, the elf\
  \ being an elf does not change where the magics overlap. But where is that? The\
  \ spells target an object, rather than stating an emanation. For the purpose of\
  \ determining where light and darkness magics have an overlapping region, look at\
  \ the spell and determine the farthest radius where it has an effect (for example,\
  \ that would be 120 feet for <i>daylight</i>, 20 feet for <i>darkness</i>, and 40\
  \ feet for <i>continual flame</i>).</li>\n    </ul> \n    <p>So, using these guidelines,\
  \ lets take a look at a complicated example that brings each one of these into play:</p>\
  \ \n    <blockquote class=\"dark-grey\"> \n     <hr> \n     <h3>Extended Example</h3>\
  \ \n     <p>Level 8 Feiya, Kyra, Ezren, and Damiel are traveling through the Darklands.\
  \ Damiel brewed Ezren an infusion of <i>darkvision</i>, which he has active, as\
  \ well as <i>comprehend languages</i>. Damiel also has low-light vision because\
  \ he's an elf. The rest of the group had been relying on Kyra's <i>heightened continual\
  \ flame</i> (heightened to spell level 4) to see, as well as various <i>light</i>\
  \ cantrips, since the ambient light level is darkness. The group is ambushed by\
  \ a group of darkfolk in a large cavern. In the first wave, dark creepers emerge\
  \ from the darkness, each of them having cast <i>darkness</i> prior to the encounter.\
  \ From the distance, no one, not even Ezren, can see the creepers, as they are beyond\
  \ the range of his 60 foot darkvision. As they approach to 60 feet, Ezren spots\
  \ them because of his darkvision. Damiel still can't see them because Kyra's <i>heightened\
  \ continual flame</i> counts as extending 40 feet for the purpose of determining\
  \ where it overlaps their <i>darkness</i>. As they approach within 40 feet, everyone\
  \ can see them, as Kyra's <i>heightened continual flame</i> defeats the <i>darkness</i>\
  \ in the area of overlap. The other <i>light</i> spells stop working, though.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Next, the dark stalkers advance, with their <i>deeper darkness</i> spells\
  \ active. Even when they get to 60 feet, Ezren can't see them because it's supernatural\
  \ darkness. However, since Kyra's <i>heightened continual flame</i> is heightened\
  \ to 4th level, it keeps shining brightly. Since no one ever takes the Dark Folk\
  \ language, the darkfolk use it to coordinate their attacks. Sadly for them, Ezren\
  \ understands them anyway, and he warns Feiya that the darkfolk have a dark slayer\
  \ who somehow heightened his spell-like ability <i>deeper darkness</i> to 4th level\
  \ once per day through numerous blood sacrifices. Feiya nods, pulls out her rod\
  \ of lesser reach metamagic and readies an action to counterspell with <i>wandering\
  \ star motes</i> (which now has a range of 180 feet). Since <i>wandering star motes</i>\
  \ is a 4th level light spell, the heightened <i>deeper darkness</i> is equal or\
  \ lower level, so the counterspell ruins the dark slayer's big chance! The dark\
  \ slayer snarls in anger and sends in its last big wildcard, a dark creeper barbarian,\
  \ who sunders Kyra's <i>heightened continual flame</i>. This allows all those <i>deeper\
  \ darkness</i> spells to defeat the remaining light sources easily, plunging the\
  \ entire area into supernatural darkness, much to the darkfolks' delight.</p> \n\
  \     <p>Ezren ends their victory cheers early by casting <i>daylight</i> on his\
  \ cane, which negates everything in the overlapping area, leaving the fight at the\
  \ prevailing light level, normal darkness (hey, at least Ezren can see now!). Damiel,\
  \ alchemist that he is, cracks a sunrod, which now provides light to everyone else.\
  \ Desperate now, the dark slayer sends in the dark stalkers, who cast <i>deeper\
  \ darkness</i> and then deliver the touch spell to Ezren's cane. They succeed, which\
  \ dispels the <i>daylight</i> because <i>daylight</i> is equal or lower spell level.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Fed up with the whole situation, Kyra uses her 8th level sun domain\
  \ ability nimbus of light, which instantly dispels all the darkness spells in 30\
  \ feet and then shines like a <i>daylight</i>. The battle is over soon after.</p>\
