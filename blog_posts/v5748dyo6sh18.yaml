  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">For months now, we at Paizo\
  \ have been holding onto an incredible secret: Starfinder, the science-fantasy game\
  \ that mixes dragons with robotics and magic missiles with high-tech hacking, is\
  \ coming to Amazon Alexa!</p> \n     <p>Let me repeat that. This is not a drill.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>On December 16, a voice-based version of the Starfinder Roleplaying\
  \ Game will be available for free on Alexa devices through Amazon’s cloud-based\
  \ voice service. We’re giving you a heads-up on this release so that you can track\
  \ down any of the Alexa-supported devices and, if you want, play the moment the\
  \ free episode drops!</p> \n     <p>At launch, just say \"Alexa, play Starfinder!\"\
  \ on any Alexa-enabled device. You’ll beam straight into an adapted version of “\
  Scoundrels in the Spike,” the adventure I wrote for the <i>Starfinder Beginner Box</i>.\
  \ </p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/12519-starfinderalexa.jpg\"\
  \ alt=\"Amazon Alexa Starfinder Promo Image\"></a>\n      <img style=\"max-width:100%\"\
  \ src=\"/image/content/Blog/12519-starfinderalexa.jpg\"> \n     </div> \n     <p>The\
  \ adaptation script was written by none other than James L. Sutter, former Starfinder\
  \ Creative Director and an amazing author whose work really makes this voice experience\
  \ shine. Incredible voice actors, sound effects, and music further make this game\
  \ sing. Specifically, when Starfinder Creative Director Robert G. McCreary and I\
  \ heard the rich soundscapes of Absalom Station and felt the tension of combat with\
  \ space goblins, we were gleefully astonished. This project has brought Starfinder’\
  s world to life just as we imagined, and for me it was a truly awe-inspiring experience.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>The rules Alexa uses to run the adventure are similarly adapted\
  \ from the Beginner Box. Starfinder fans will recognize the player character options\
  \ as Iseph the iconic operative, Quig the iconic mechanic, and Navasi the iconic\
  \ envoy. What’s more, Raia the iconic technomancer can serve as a best friend and\
  \ sidekick in these adventures. Simply put, there’s a lot to recognize and love\
  \ if you’re already a fan of Starfinder. If you’re new to the game or even to tabletop\
  \ RPGs in general, this experience is a fantastic gateway to a lifetime of adventure\
  \ and fun</p> \n     <p>Beyond the pilot episode, Paizo and Amazon have big plans\
  \ to bring more paid episodes of the Starfinder voice game to Alexa. But we’ll save\
  \ that reveal for another blog—and probably a press release or two. </p> \n    \
  \ <p>Before I smoke-bomb away from this exciting announcement, I’d like to just\
  \ gush for a moment about how much of a dream this project was, both as a creative\
  \ and as a manager. As we’ve spun up this initiative, I’ve gotten to work with some\
  \ fantastic folks at Amazon, whose excitement for this project has left me energized\
  \ and astounded at the power of tabletop storytelling across all media.</p> \n \
  \    <p>I’ve also gotten to work extensively with Rob and Sutter on this project.\
  \ It’s been like a wonderful reunion of sorts, bringing me back to the days of working\
  \ with those guys on the Starfinder Core Rulebook—and it’s made me realize how much\
  \ I miss working with Sutter, especially since we both have a tendency to shriek\
  \ and cackle when we get excited in creative meetings. I miss making that beautiful\
  \ music with you, James.</p> \n     <p>Nostalgia aside, the entire Starfinder Alexa\
  \ project has involved great team members, and the Starfinder team as well as folks\
  \ all across Paizo have done a great job giving us feedback on the in-development\
  \ game and generally supporting us along the way. </p> \n     <p>Now, time for that\
  \ smoke bomb! Check out “Scoundrels in the Spike” when it drops, and stay tuned\
  \ for more Paizo-Amazon news soon to come!</p> \n     <p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\
