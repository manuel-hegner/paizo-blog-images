  \ Hail Lamashtu!</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Friday, July 25, 2014</p> \n    <div\
  \ itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n     <p><span itemprop=\"description\">This evening\
  \ the entire Paizo crew is headed to a local winery for our annual summer party,\
  \ and everyone at the office right now is either diligently working nose-to-desk\
  \ to finish that last bit of work before the weekend or goofing off counting down\
  \ the hours until a bacchanal of all-you-can-drink wine. It's a tough life, folks,\
  \ I have to tell you.</span></p> \n     <p>I'm one of the nose-grinders today, alas,\
  \ so before I dip my cup into the well of wine and wishes, I'd like to take a few\
  \ minutes to reveal three more figures from November's <a href=\"/products/btpy96kb\"\
  ><i>The Lost Coast</i></a> set of <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder Battles</a>\
  \ prepainted fantasy miniatures!</p> \n     <p>As I've mentioned before in previous\
  \ Friday Preview blogs, <a href=\"/products/btpy96kb\"><i>The Lost Coast</i></a>\
  \ does not take its inspiration from a specific Adventure Path like many of our\
  \ previous miniature sets, but rather draws inspiration from the Lost Coast region\
  \ of Varisia. That's allowed us to sneak in cool figures from campaigns like the\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy8rqs\">Rise of the Runelords</a> as well as some more\
  \ \"generic\" creatures that work in any environment, but it's also given us the\
  \ opportunity to include some figures based off another Varisian story—<a href=\"\
  /store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics\">the Pathfinder Comic\
  \ Book</a>.</p> \n     <p>All three of today's previews involve the treacherous\
  \ Cult of Lamashtu, the Mother of Monsters. Two of them come directly from the comic's\
  \ first two volumes. The last figure, alas, comes exclusively from the warped mind\
  \ of our Creative Director, James Jacobs, by way of Mesopotamian mythology.</p>\
  \ \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20140725-Etainia.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20140725-Etainia_180.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>Up first this week is Etainia, the primary villain of the\
  \ comic's first arc, <a href=\"/products/btpy921r\"><i>Dark Waters Rising</i></a>.\
  \ Befitting her role as a priestess of the goddess of monstrous births, Etainia\
  \ sports a distended belly filled with some hideous unborn creature. She's also\
  \ got cool gauntlets, a nice fur-lined cloak, and a haughty demeanor. You can also\
  \ pair her with the <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lg3v\">Lamashtu Cultists</a>\
  \ we previewed in our very first Lost Coast reveal to build a truly terrifying adventure\
  \ against Lamashtu's hideous cult. Etainia is a Medium figure slated at the rare\
  \ rarity.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20140725-Thelsikar.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20140725-Thelsikar_180.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>Etainia and her cult have many grim allies in the region\
  \ surrounding Sandpoint, and few are as fearsome as Thelsikar, the evil mystic who\
  \ serves as the primary antagonist of the Pathfinder comic's second story arc, <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy94re\"><i>Of Tooth and Claw</i></a>. Thelsikar stands ready\
  \ with a deadly potion or bomb (your choice), very much as he appears on the cover\
  \ of <a href=\"/products/btpy915k\">Pathfinder #11</a>. Interestingly, that story\
  \ arc takes its inspiration from the adventures contained in the <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/products/beginnerbox\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder RPG Beginner Box</i></a>, making Thelsikar an interesting pick-up\
  \ for GMs looking to add some oomph to that boxed set. Thelsikar is a Medium, rare\
  \ figure.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20140725-Lamashtu.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20140725-Lamashtu_180.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>Last, but certainly not least, we have the goddess Lamashtu\
  \ herself! (Or, rather, a manifestation of her form suitable for doing battle with\
  \ your player characters—or simply terrifying them). We don't actually have official\
  \ statistics for fighting gods in the Pathfinder RPG, but that should make it even\
  \ more frightening when you plop this miniature down in front of your players. I'd\
  \ probably re-skin a high-level demon to look like Lamashtu, and watch as my \"\
  heroes\" run for the exits. With all the Lamashtu fun already packed into the <i>Lost\
  \ Coast</i>, I simply couldn't resist inviting the lady herself. I hope you'll forgive\
  \ me (because I just know her enemy Pazuzu never will!). Lamashtu is a Large, rare\
  \ creature.</p> \n     <p><b>FEIYA UPDATE:</b> While some details remain to be ironed\
  \ out, I can reveal that WizKids intends to replace any unsuitable Feiya figure\
  \ with a brand new, higher-quality version through their normal figure redemption\
  \ service. The replacement figure will be the same sculpt, with an improved paint\
  \ job. The text on the bottom of the base will be identical. These replacement figures\
  \ are currently in production, so I can't reveal exactly WHEN they will be ready,\
  \ but I can publicly confirm that this is the plan, and that the plan is in motion\
  \ as you read this. We'll reveal more in future updates as I get more information,\
  \ but I wanted to at least confirm that anyone who wants a replacement figure will\
  \ (relatively) soon be able to get one through the normal figure replacement channels.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>And that's it for this week. I'm off to drink some wiiiiiiiiiiiiine!\
  \ (For my health!)</p> \n     <p>See you next week!</p> \n     <p>Erik Mona<br>\
