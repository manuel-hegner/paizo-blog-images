  artist: "fans. The second forum is the Conversions Forum, which contains fan-made\
    \ conversions of a host of 3.5 rules and products, making them easier to use with\
    \ the Pathfinder RPG. In addition to the Pathfinder RPG forums, you will find\
    \ an array of other forums for our other products. The Pathfinder General Discussion\
    \ Forum is for talking about any product with the Pathfinder logo, focusing on\
    \ products that are compatible with the Pathfinder campaign setting (such as the\
    \ Pathfinder Chronicles, Pathfinder Companion, Pathfinder Modules, and Pathfinder\
    \ Accessories products). The Pathfinder Adventure Path Section contains a forum\
    \ for each one of our Adventure Paths. These products represent complete campaigns,\
    \ taking your characters"
