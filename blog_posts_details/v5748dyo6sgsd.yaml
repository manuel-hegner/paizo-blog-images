  alt: "Rules: Goblin markers. One side of each of these role cards uses goblin markers.\
    \ Each character using goblin markers chooses one type of marker. (Since there\
    \ are only 7 markers of each type in the game, this means that unless you have\
    \ a power that allows you to steal markers, you cannot have more than 7 goblin\
    \ markers on your role.)"
