  ></a> \n    </div> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">A couple of weeks ago Crystal\
  \ Frasier let me know that she'd be moving on from Paizo to focus on her freelancing\
  \ career. I was terribly saddened by this news, but I can't say I was wholly surprised.\
  \ Crystal is an excellent developer and writer, but she's also an amazing artist,\
  \ illustrator, cartographer, and has been knocking it out of the park with her comics.\
  \ However, don't fret too much, Crystal has told me that she still wants to write\
  \ for us as a freelancer, so you'll still be getting her top-notch adventures, monsters,\
  \ and articles on some of the things she loves. As we do here at Paizo when one\
  \ of our greats departs, I've collected some heartfelt thoughts and well wishes\
  \ from the staff to send Crystal off!</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><b>Jason\
  \ Tondro (Editor): </b>\"I've only had the pleasure of knowing Crystal as a coworker\
  \ for a few months, but I have long admired her work in and for the industry. Crystal\
  \ has made gaming both smarter and more just, and it's no surprise that she's now\
  \ got so much work on her plate that she can't afford to stay with us here at Paizo.\
  \ But in this case, what's bad for Paizo is good for everyone, and I'm looking forward\
  \ to seeing more of Crystal's work on an even larger stage. Sincere congratulations,\
  \ Crystal, and please just keep on doing what you're doing.\"</p> \n     <p><b>Chris\
  \ Sims (Developer): </b>\"Unfortunately for me, I don't yet know Crystal as well\
  \ as I might have liked. I do know she brings a ton of craft and skill to this team.\
  \ More than that, though, she adds a lot of humor and insight. I can't count how\
  \ many times we've all enjoyed a moment of levity or I've been left rethinking something\
  \ because of what Crystal said during a conversation or meeting. It's plain we're\
  \ all better off with her here. It's also clear we'll miss her when she's not. That\
  \ said, we're lucky she'll still be available for freelance gigs. Don't forget about\
  \ us, Crystal! All the best to you, too!\"</p> \n     <p><b>Owen KC Stephens (Starfinder\
  \ Design Lead):</b> \"Crystal was one of the people I was most excited to get to\
  \ work with when I was hired at Paizo, and I can safely say the experience has been\
  \ very much worth it. Her game industry career goes back longer than mine does and\
  \ she's succeeded at many more roles, giving her a vast wealth of knowledge and\
  \ experience I've been happy to draw on and learn from. As sad as I am to lose her\
  \ from my daily work routine, I am excited to see what she does in her new endeavors!</p>\
  \ \n     <p>We'll miss you Crystal!\"</p> \n     <p><b>Adam Daigle (Managing Developer):</b>\
  \ \"I'm not crying, YOU'RE CRYING!</p> \n     <p>Over the years I have known Crystal\
  \ as a friend, freelancer, and then coworker. When I first came to Paizo, Crystal\
  \ was in another department, so I didn't get to see her that much during the normal\
  \ workday, but when she moved into the editorial department as a developer, we sat\
  \ right next to each other. We were both working on the Adventure Paths and had\
  \ each other to cheer on, commiserate with, and of course crack jokes with. We both\
  \ grew up on the Gulf Coast and have a shared love for trash animals, and we often\
  \ loved to confuse and weird out other members of the crew with our strange bayou\
  \ lore. I'm not only going to miss not having my swamp sister around for those reasons,\
  \ but also because Crystal is brilliantly creative, extremely funny, and one of\
  \ the most skilled storytellers I've had the pleasure to read and work with. Kick\
  \ ass on your future endeavors, Crystal! I can't wait to see what you create!\"\
  </p> \n     <p><b>Mark Seifter (Designer):</b> \"I first learned who Crystal was\
  \ roughly 7 years ago, when I started to realize that so many of my favorite Pathfinder\
  \ Society scenarios, and my favorite module The Harrowing, were written by the same\
  \ author, and I first met her when she gave me a Harrow reading at the Paizocon\
  \ Grand Convocation. I later learned that Crystal is as talented at so many other\
  \ aspects of adventure development as she is at writing adventures, whether it be\
  \ maps and art, characterization, plotline, you name it. For my money, Crystal's\
  \ adventures are some of the best in the business, and it's really no surprise that\
  \ my Pathfinder group opted to play Ironfang Invasion followed by War for the Crown.\
  \ Those Adventure Paths are just that good, and if you're reading this and haven't\
  \ checked them out yet, you should. Crystal leaving to pursue full-time freelance\
  \ is a loss for Paizo, but our loss is the freelancing community's gain. I'll be\
  \ looking for her name on all sorts of exciting new projects now, just like 7 years\
  \ ago. But honestly? I never stopped.\"</p> \n     <p><b>Sonja Morris (Art Director):</b>\
  \ \"When I started at Paizo, Crystal was a member of the art department, and she\
  \ helped me navigate the complex web that <i>was</i> our file storage system. Without\
  \ Crystal's assistance, I am certain the <i>Pathfinder Adventure Card Game: Rise\
  \ of the Runelords</i> would not have made it to the printer on time, and I don't\
  \ know what I would have done without her help! Her quick wit is always good for\
  \ a giggle, or a belly laugh, depending on the gag. Over the years, as she's moved\
  \ around the company, I have seen her grow both professionally and personally and\
  \ I can't wait to see what she does next. I am sure what ever it is it will be magnificent!\"\

  \     </div> \n     <p><b>Ron Lundeen (Developer):</b> \"I have nothing but wonderful\
  \ things to say about Crystal, and that probably frustrates her a lot. We've worked\
  \ closely together as freelancer-developer for years, and as cubicle mates for just\
  \ over 6 months. She's highly regarded in this industry (and others!) precisely\
  \ because she's insightful, talented, and really, really hardworking. Early on,\
  \ Crystal insisted that my relentless optimism wouldn't spoil her crusty pessimism\
  \ (you'll see she put a Pessimist campaign trait in the Tyrant's Grasp Player's\
  \ Guide to reinforce her position). And oh, how I've tried! In the end, though,\
  \ I'm counting her departure as a checkmark on the optimism side of the board, because\
  \ she's going on to exciting products, fun work, and a great life—you'll see!\"\
  </p> \n     <p><b>Linda Zayas-Palmer (Developer):</b> \"The first time I talked\
  \ to Crystal was right after a panel at PaizoCon 5 or 6 years ago. I'd recently\
  \ had a wonderful time running a module she wrote, the Harrowing. I remember sitting\
  \ there starstruck for a while, psyching myself up to go up to her and tell her\
  \ how much I loved her writing and to compliment her awesome purple hair. I can't\
  \ really call this meeting Crystal, since in my excitement, I forgot to introduce\
  \ myself and just awkwardly fangirled over her for a few minutes. She was very nice\
  \ about it though :)</p> \n     <p>I met Crystal for real when she started working\
  \ as a developer right around the same time that I joined Paizo. And I have to say,\
  \ I admire her more now than I did as a fan. Crystal is a compassionate, funny,\
  \ and extremely talented person. She is a wellspring of creative ideas, lovely art,\
  \ punny humor, and references to 80's and 90's pop culture. It's been a pleasure\
  \ to be on a team with her. We'll miss you, Crystal! Whatever projects you take\
  \ on next, I'm sure you'll knock them out of the park.\"</p> \n     <p><b>Jason\
  \ Keeley (Developer):</b> \"I have only known Crystal for a couple of years, but\
  \ the nice things I have to say about her could probably fill a hardcover. She is\
  \ talented, funny, clever, and only threatened to drink me under the table like\
  \ once or twice. We are going to miss her so much. Hopefully, I will still get to\
  \ game with her so this better not be goodbye forever! We still have that \"Pigs\
  \ in Space\" campaign to do!\"</p> \n     <p><b>Lyz Liddell (Editor):</b> \"Crystal\
  \ is the game designer I want to be when I grow up. She's brilliant, creative, fun,\
  \ passionate, clever, dedicated to positive and diverse representation in our products,\
  \ and not afraid to speak her mind. I've learned a ton by working on the materials\
  \ she's developed, and I'm going to miss working with her.\"</p> \n     <p><b>Leo\
  \ Glass (Editor):</b> \"While I haven't worked with Crystal long, it was clear on\
  \ day one how her endless creativity and sense of humor make the world around her\
  \ a better place. I will miss all the laughter she brought to our team, but wish\
  \ her the best of luck with her next journey. (And look forward to reading all of\
  \ the super-awesome products she plans to write!)\"</p> \n     <p><b>Stephen Radney-MacFarland\
  \ (Senior Designer):</b> \"I met Crystal before I came to Paizo. She was in the\
  \ first game design class I ever taught at the Art Institute of Seattle. She was\
  \ a fantastic student, someone who I always knew would go far in any pursuit. She\
  \ had this tremendous mix of analytical force and creative talent that I enjoyed\
  \ and respected. Hell, I still do. She's only gotten better at her various crafts.\
  \ Crystal leaving Paizo is a loss for us as a company, but is to the benefit of\
  \ all the rest of geekdom and beyond. Go forth and conquer, Crystal. It is your\
  \ destiny.\"</p> \n     <p><b>John Compton (Organized Play Lead Developer):</b>\
  \ \"Before I joined Paizo in 2013, I only knew Crystal by reputation, from her module-writing\
  \ fame to fan's gushing experiences about her Harrow readings at PaizoCon. After\
  \ five years with her as my colleague, I can confirm that whatever positive things\
  \ you've heard? They're true. Anything negative? You can't prove it; we helped her\
  \ hide the bodies.</p> \n     <p>Crystal's a wonderful coworker and collaborator,\
  \ especially in smaller meetings where we can feed on one another's enthusiasm and\
  \ build upon each other's ideas as happened with projects like War for the Crown.\
  \ She brings a playfulness to brainstorming, passion to adventures, and a range\
  \ of accents to the gaming table—all while being so practiced in visual arts that\
  \ she can idly illustrate characters or sketch maps with more skill than the rest\
  \ of us can manage with our undivided attention. Beyond that, she's been an outspoken\
  \ advocate for diversity in Paizo's products, promoting minorities' visibility in\
  \ our stories in positive ways and showing the rest of us how we can do the same.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Crystal has been a source of inspiration and wisdom in my time at Paizo,\
  \ and it's helped push me to try and return the favor at least half as often. I\
  \ hope that we'll have more opportunities to collaborate in the future.\"</p> \n\

  \     </div> \n     <p><b>Logan Bonner (Designer): </b>\"What an utterly delightful\
  \ person. What a talented, engaged, and thoughtful coworker. What a champion for\
  \ justice and compassion. Since I came to Paizo, I've been amazed by Crystal over\
  \ and over. She's an excellent example, out there being an inspiration to new writers\
  \ that not only can they do this, they might someday be <i>almost as good as Crystal\
  \ Frasier</i>.</p> \n     <p>Crystal has been an institution here at Paizo, and\
  \ now she's going off to become her own institution. A majestic, terrifying institution.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>As she sails off into the sunset aboard her Footski, I can almost hear\
  \ her cursing our names, but kindly, as is her way. We'll miss that clever cursing.\
  \ Thank you for being a friend, a colleague, and a force of nature. Dammit, we'll\
  \ miss you!\"</p> \n     <p><b>Amanda Hamon Kunz (Managing Developer): </b>\"When\
  \ I first started working at Paizo three years ago, I was star struck by the thought\
  \ that I would be working with <i>the</i> Crystal Frasier. Crystal was a titan of\
  \ the industry—a woman who had done so much, from designing and laying out products\
  \ to creating awesome art to writing some truly impressive first- and third-party\
  \ products. But once I walked into the office, I realized that not only are all\
  \ of those things absolutely true, even more than I realized as a freelancer, but\
  \ that Crystal is also one of the most creative, most energetic, most uniquely awesome\
  \ people I have met. As the months and years rolled on, Crystal taught me a lot\
  \ about being a creative, but she also taught me how to be a better person and how\
  \ to always fight for what I believe is right. She became one of my closest friends\
  \ in the office, and I'm a better person for it. Crystal, as sad as I am to see\
  \ you leave, and as much as I will deeply miss your incredible presence here, I\
  \ know that you have fantastic things ahead of you. I can't wait to see what you\
  \ do next. I will always be here to cheer you along from the sidelines.\"</p> \n\
  \     <p><b>Judy Bauer (Managing Editor):</b> \"Crystal cares a LOT, and it shows.\
  \ Her writing is always exciting, with frequent moments of hilarity (the attack\
  \ of the crawling hands in <i>Pathfinder Adventure Path #79</i>!), but when it's\
  \ serious, it's SERIOUS—her foreword to <i>Pathfinder Adventure Path #117</i> brought\
  \ me to tears. It also shows in her relationships at work: she's been a mentor,\
  \ a friend, and a source of inspiration for many at Paizo over the years. And it\
  \ shows in her life: she's politically active, and a strong voice for representation\
  \ and justice. I'm going to miss her enthusiasm and intensity so much!</p> \n  \
  \   <p>Crystal, all the best luck with your (many) new ventures, and I hope to get\
  \ to edit much more of your awesome writing in the future!\"</p> \n     <p><b>Chris\
  \ Carey (Senior Editor):</b> \"I've known Crystal for almost ten years now. She\
  \ first came on board as an intern in Paizo's art department when we were still\
  \ over at the old office building, and I think she may be the most recent hire to\
  \ be able to still remember the stained carpets and the tiny, cramped workspace\
  \ that penned in the editorial staff over there. Of course, Crystal left the art\
  \ department back in the day and has been an outstanding game developer and Pathfinder\
  \ writer for years now, both developing and authoring some of the most enjoyable\
  \ and creative turnovers to come across the editors' desks. But more than that,\
  \ she has made Paizo a more enjoyable place to work with her laughter and wit and\
  \ uniquely Crystal sense of humor. I'll miss you, Crystal, but I'm excited for the\
  \ path that lies ahead of you!\"</p> \n     <p><b>Mark Moreland (Franchise Manager):\
  \ </b>\"I first met Crystal at the second PaizoCon, way back in 2009. I recall her\
  \ approaching Erik Mona and Sarah Robinson about possibly interning at Paizo and\
  \ how envious I was of her simply for living in close proximity to the office and\
  \ having the guts to get a foot in the door. Just over a year later, I moved across\
  \ the country to join her at Paizo, and she was one of my most helpful cube-mates\
  \ until the first of many desk reshuffles happened. Every time the ongoing game\
  \ of musical cubes put us near one another, I was always ecstatic. There are many\
  \ fun people in this office, but few are as funny, intelligent, and creative as\
  \ Crystal, and she has an aura effect that gives morale bonuses to these same stats\
  \ to everyone in a 30-foot radius.</p> \n     <p>I first developed Crystal's work\
  \ when I tackled her innovative Pathfinder Society Scenario, <i>Below the Silver\
  \ Tarn</i> just a few months after I took over the Pathfinder Society Organized\
  \ Play campaign back in 2010. Her unique encounter designs, incredible mapping skills,\
  \ and layered storytelling quickly put her at the top of my \"would work with again\"\
  \ list, and made her the ideal candidate to write one of my all-time favorite Pathfinder\
  \ adventures, <i>Pathfinder Module: The Harrowing</i>. We knew we wanted to make\
  \ an adventure wherein the PCs travel inside a harrow deck and meet the creatures\
  \ and threats on the cards themselves, and there was no one else on the list of\
  \ potential authors other than Crystal. Her ability to interweave 54 random illustrations\
  \ into a cohesive narrative with a deep, expansive mythology and a subsystem of\
  \ using the harrow deck itself to augment gameplay resulted in a product I am incredibly\
  \ proud to have worked on.</p> \n     <p>That's not the only time Crystal made me\
  \ look good, either. I had the pleasure of working closely with her on the back\
  \ matter of the Ironfang Invasion and War for the Crown adventure paths, and she\
  \ developed <i>Taldor, The First Empire</i> into a better final book. She's also\
  \ had an immeasurable influence on how I look at issues of inclusion and diversity\
  \ in game design, and the different perspectives she brought to the creative process\
  \ over the years has made an indelible mark on my narrative sensibilities.</p> \n\
  \     <p>I'll miss having you around the office, Crystal, but am overjoyed that\
  \ you've promised to continue writing for both Pathfinder and Starfinder in your\
  \ newfound free(lance) time. The future for someone with your myriad talents is\
  \ certainly bright, and I wish you all the best. Don't be a stranger!\"</p> \n \
