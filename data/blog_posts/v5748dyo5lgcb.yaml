  >For many years now, roleplaying games have used the term shaman to mean a lot of\
  \ different things. Most often, the term is used to describe the spiritual leader\
  \ of a primitive people or tribe. The shaman would commune with the spirits to beseech\
  \ them for aid or guidance. The only problem with this was that it did not closely\
  \ match any of the classes we have in the game. Until now.</span></p> \n     <p>In\
  \ the early days of the <a href=\"/products/btpy95d1\"><i>Advanced Class Guide</i></a>,\
  \ the shaman joined the list of classes that would appear in the book. It seemed\
  \ like a no-brainer, a hole in our assortment of fantasy concepts that needed to\
  \ be filled. As with the other classes, figuring out which two classes the shaman\
  \ would draw from turned out to be the tricky part. The shaman wanted a connection\
  \ to the divine, a connection to nature, and a connection to some of the more dark\
  \ aspects of magic. Although we finally settled on pulling mechanics and concepts\
  \ from the oracle and the witch, the druid was also a very strong contender for\
  \ adding parts to the class.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb180\">\n      <a href=\"\

  ></a>\n      <br>Illustration by Subroto Bhaumik\n     </div> \n     <p>The first\
  \ draft of the shaman gave us a class that had hexes like a witch and a new concept\
  \ called spirits. These work a lot like oracle mysteries, but they are a little\
  \ more limited. This is made up for by the fact that at higher levels you can commune\
  \ with a second spirit each day. While the first is set when you take your first\
  \ level of shaman, the second is “wandering”, meaning that you can change it each\
  \ day when you prepare your spells. So while your primary spirit helps define your\
  \ character and its personality, the second can become a sort of “flavor of the\
  \ day”, giving you a choice of mechanical options and a way for you to shift your\
  \ personality too!</p> \n     <p>The playtest told us a lot about the shaman. While\
  \ the first draft of the class used the cleric spell list, we tried something radically\
  \ different with the second draft, giving it an expanded version of the druid spell\
  \ list. Neither quite met the needs of the class, which is why in the final version,\
  \ you will find that the shaman has its own unique spell list. While much of this\
  \ list is drawn from the cleric and the witch spell lists, there are a number of\
  \ formerly druid-only spells finding their way into the shaman’s arsenal.</p> \n\
  \     <p>There are a number of other exciting changes for the final version of the\
  \ shaman as well. We upped the number of hexes received to one every two levels,\
  \ with the wandering hexes taking the place of the normal hex at 6th and 14th levels.\
  \ To give you a wider breadth of options to choose from, the shaman now also includes\
  \ a list of hexes available to all shaman’s regardless of their chosen spirit. While\
  \ many of these will be familiar, there are a few new ones in here specifically\
  \ tied to the shaman’s theme. Take a look.</p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p><i>Fury\
  \ (Su)</i>: The shaman incites a creature within 30 feet into a primal fury. The\
  \ target receives a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls and a +2 resistance bonus on\
  \ saving throws against fear for a number of rounds equal to the shaman’s Wisdom\
  \ modifier. At 8th and 16th level, these bonuses increase by 1. Once a creature\
  \ has benefited from the fury hex, it cannot benefit from it again for 24 hours.</p>\
  \ \n      <p><i>Shapeshift (Su)</i>: The shaman transforms herself into another\
  \ form for a number of minutes per day equal to her level, as <i>alter self</i>.\
  \ This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute\
  \ increments. Changing form (including changing back) is a standard action that\
  \ does not provoke an attack of opportunity. At 8th level, this ability works as\
  \ <i>beast shape I</i>. At 12th level, this ability works as <i>beast shape II</i>.\
  \ At 16th level, this ability works as <i>beast shape III</i>. At 20th level, this\
  \ ability works as <i>beast shape IV</i>.</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>Of\
  \ course, you will also find a number of fun new archetypes to play when creating\
  \ a shaman character. There is the animist, who can communicate with the hostile\
  \ spirits causing her allies discomfort and cause them to depart. You could play\
  \ a possessed shaman, who allows the spirits to inhabit her body and can draw upon\
  \ their knowledge. There is the spirit warden, who battles against undead spirits,\
  \ using channel energy to send them to their final rest. Finally, there is the witch\
  \ doctor, who can heal creatures like a cleric and can counter spells with a hex\
  \ ability!</p> \n     <p>Well, that about wraps it up for the shaman. Next week,\
  \ we will be previewing the last of the 10 new classes in the <a href=\"/products/btpy95d1\"\
