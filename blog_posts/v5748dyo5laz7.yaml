  date\">Wednesday, May 12, 2010</p> \n   <p>Here at Paizo, we understand that our\
  \ fans, friends, and contributors (and the sizable cadre of folks who combine all\
  \ three categories) are a little different than most companies' communities. It's\
  \ not uncommon for Paizo fans to <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lalm\">send us pizzas\
  \ out of the blue</a> as a thank-you gesture, or offer to buy us drinks when they\
  \ run into us somewhere in the city. (Both of which initially confused us—you're\
  \ giving us presents for <i>selling</i> you books?—but we aren't complaining.) We've\
  \ seen a room full of Paizo <a href=\"/paizo/messageboards/paizoPublishing/paizocon/razmiranFaithBargeUnion107MusterToMe\"\
  >trivia champions</a>, <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5laic\">Paizo cosplay</a>,\
  \ and <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lan4\">a whole darn Paizo theater performance\
  \ from an extremely talented grade school</a> (and their supremely cool teacher).\
  \ It's humbling and awesome at the same time.</p> \n   <p>Tim Hitchcock, however,\
  \ may have just taken the cake, at least for me personally. You see, a while back,\
  \ Tim and I were talking about music in the Tuesday-night <a href=\"http://chat.dmtools.org\"\
  \ target=\"nofollow\">Paizo Chat</a>. Tim, a musician who retired from touring in\
  \ order to become a teacher, was asking me about the bass rig I used in my metal\
  \ and hardcore band, <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/shadowatmorning\" target=\"\
  nofollow\">Shadow at Morning</a>, and my opinions on distortion pedals. I said that\
  \ I thought they were cool, but I'd never gotten around to picking one up.</p> \n\
  \   <p>\"Why don't I build you one?\" he asked. Apparently Mr. Hitchcock knows a\
  \ thing or two about electronics.</p> \n   <p>I wasn't sure what to expect, but\
  \ it's not every day somebody offers to build you custom gear. I said sure, and\
  \ promptly forgot about it for about six months.</p> \n   <p>And then today, I got\
  \ this in the mail: proof positive that Tim Hitchcock is totally insane, in the\
  \ best possible sense of the word. (When I originally opened the package, the glowing\
  \ light made Wes think Tim must have finally had enough and decided to send us a\
  \ letter bomb.)</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <table align=\"\

  \ question (at least until I get it home and plug it in), my favorite part is the\
  \ little goblin that Tim etched into the steel of the faceplate. (And in case you're\
  \ wondering, the goblin is referencing the classic Big Muff bass pedal, upon which\
  \ Tim based the electronics.) </p> \n   <p>Though Shadow at Morning unfortunately\
  \ disbanded a few weeks before the pedal's arrival, I'm already in the process of\
  \ recording with a new project, and you can bet that when we're ready to hit the\
  \ stage, Tim's phenomenal creation will be front and center...</p> \n   <p>James\
