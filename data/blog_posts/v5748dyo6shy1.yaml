  \ \n     <blockquote> \n      <h2>THE WIND BENEATH THE PEAKS</h2> \n      <p itemprop=\"\
  description\">The sky was scabbed over with ominous looking clouds, but Amiri refused\
  \ to take them as an ill omen. Just being back here in these mountains was all the\
  \ bad luck she needed.</p> \n      <p>Amiri hadn’t yet decided just how much of\
  \ a fool she was for coming back to the lands of her birth. Just on the other side\
  \ of these peaks lay the place where she’d stood drenched in the blood of her kin:\
  \ the finest warriors of the Six Bears. Men she had called her brothers. Her friends.\
  \ She had felt the heat of their blood fading from her skin and known she could\
  \ never go home again.</p> \n      <p>She’d told herself she never wanted to.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>And in the time since, she never had. Until now. Following a witch-woman’\
  s words of warning and promise. Because though in all that time she’d never wanted\
  \ to return these lands had never fully loosed their hold on her.</p> \n      <p>Amiri\
  \ gritted her teeth as she hauled herself over the sheer flank of a boulder. From\
  \ here she could see down the slope toward the overgrown valley below and peer up\
  \ toward the snow-crusted peaks. Not a single crow cawed. No mice scuttled among\
  \ the rocks and scree.</p> \n      <p>More bad omens, maybe. Or they’d been scared\
  \ off by a lumbering warrior who’d forgotten the way of navigating easily through\
  \ this landscape, she thought, and spat.</p> \n      <p>“Told you it was a bad idea.”\
  \ she muttered, though there was no one else to hear. She’d told herself it was\
  \ a bad idea just about every step of the way, but she couldn’t get the witch-woman’\
  s words out of her head.</p> \n      <p>The town was nothing special. Just a cluster\
  \ of unremarkable houses, preyed on by unremarkable bandits who were foolish enough\
  \ to mistake Amiri for an easy target. She hadn’t even known the town was there\
  \ until the residents greeted her cheering, at the gates. They’d insisted on a feast,\
  \ and who was Amiri to turn down free food?</p> \n      <p>The witch-woman’s gift\
  \ had been less welcome.</p> \n      <p>“I don’t have any gold to offer, but I have\
  \ a fortune,” she'd said.</p> \n      <p>“Knowing the future only ever causes trouble.”\
  \ Amiri replied with a grunt, starting to turn away, but the woman had held on with\
  \ a surprisingly firm grip.</p> \n      <p>“You hear the whispers. The wind among\
  \ the peaks. When you wake, when you sleep. You hear their voices. The men you killed.\
  \ You hear them mocking you. You hear them cursing you.”</p> \n      <p>“Leave me\
  \ be.” Amiri had growled, but the woman was relentless.</p> \n      <p>“I see you\
  \ returning to the land of your birth. I see two stray cubs, a broken blade. I see\
  \ your heart torn from your chest,” the woman intoned.</p> \n      <p>“My heart\
  \ torn from my chest?” Amiri echoed, skeptical. “Doesn’t sound like something I\
  \ ought to go looking for.”</p> \n      <p>The old woman shrugged. “Could be a metaphor.\
  \ Can’t always tell with these things. But I hear the splintering of bones.” The\
  \ smoke from the cookfire twined around them, strangely thick.</p> \n      <p>“\
  You’re telling me if I go back there... what? I find some kind of peace?” Amiri\
  \ had asked, voice sharp with scorn. She was a creature of battle and bloodshed,\
  \ not peace.</p> \n      <p>Though maybe sometimes she did hear the wind howling\
  \ in the peaks. Maybe sometimes she even thought she imagined voices in that wind,\
  \ and felt—what? Not guilt or regret, exactly.</p> \n      <p>More the sense of\
  \ something unfinished.</p> \n      <p>“Peace? No. A kind of silence, maybe.” the\
  \ witch said.</p> \n      <p>That night Amiri dreamed of howling wind and when she\
  \ set out in the morning, her path bent northward.</p> \n      <p>Part of her had\
  \ almost expected spirits of vengeance to come screaming out of the sky the moment\
  \ she entered the Six Bears’ territory but so far, her journey had been uneventful.\
  \ She was skirting the edge of it now, just at the border of her old clan’s hunting\
  \ grounds. If everything was as barren as this, it must have been a lean winter.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>A skittering of rock drew her attention up the slope. She almost missed\
  \ it—a flash of gray against gray, something ducking behind a stone. Then came a\
  \ tiny yip and a growl. She wasn’t entirely alone here, then.</p> \n      <p><em>Two\
  \ stray cubs</em>, she thought.</p> \n      <p>“Bad idea.” She reminded herself.\
  \ But, shaking her head, she started up the slope. The footing was unstable and\
  \ twice she slid back down a foot or two, almost losing her grip on the mountainside.\
  \ But finally, she hauled herself up to where the small form had vanished. There\
  \ was a cleft in the rock—a cave, too small for a human, but large enough for an\
  \ animal’s den, perhaps. Amiri crouched, peering into the darkness.</p> \n     \
  \ <p>In her experience, fortune telling and prophecy were infuriatingly vague or\
  \ uselessly symbolic. Irony and prophecy were for bards as far as she was concerned.\
  \ Just tell her what a thing was plainly—and how to kill it. So she wasn’t really\
  \ expecting to find two stray cubs in this den. That would be too easy. Too <em>literal</em>.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Amiri took a strip of jerky from her pack and held it out. “Come on.\
  \ Be simple for once,” she muttered, and tossed it on the ground just outside the\
  \ den.</p> \n      <p>Two glowing eyes appeared in the darkness. A second set blinked\
  \ just behind. Wolves’ eyes, Amiri thought, and for one bright moment let herself\
  \ believe that she might find her “stray cubs” and be done with this whole business.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>The nearer beast sprang forward. Amiri leapt back with a wordless sound\
  \ of surprise. She’d been mistaken—that hadn’t been the click of claws she heard,\
  \ but of hooves and talons.</p> \n      <p>The cub was a hideously proportioned\
  \ thing—a fawn’s spindly front legs, an oversized wolf cub’s head, the nubs of antlers\
  \ pushing up from its blunt and blood-speckled brow. Ragged wings, pinfeathers not\
  \ yet grown in, sprouted from its back, and its hind end sported the wicked talons\
  \ of a bird of prey at the end of each scaly foot.</p> \n      <p>The peryton cub\
  \ snarled at her, hunching over the piece of jerky. The second cub scrambled out,\
  \ diving for the meat, and the two snapped and tore at each other, their antics\
  \ almost sending them rolling down the side of the mountain.</p> \n      <p>Amiri\
  \ grimaced, putting a hand to the dagger at her belt. The beasts were the size of\
  \ small dogs now—not much of a threat. But they’d grow fast, and perytons were vicious,\
  \ evil things. Fully grown, they delighted in tearing the hearts from men’s chests.\
  \ Just like the witch had seen.</p> \n      <p>Was this all the witch wanted from\
  \ her? Come here, kill a couple of perytons before they could grow up and threaten\
  \ the Six Bears? Penance for her crimes.</p> \n      <p>As if that would wipe away\
  \ the past.</p> \n      <p>She drew the dagger. The witch said find the cubs. She’\
  d found them. She’d put them down and leave and forget she was ever foolish enough\
  \ to listen to an old woman’s rambling fortunes.</p> \n      <p>The cubs seemed\
  \ to notice her at last. They looked up, their muzzles and faces plastered with\
  \ blood. No wonder the slopes were so quiet. Even fledglings would go after anything\
  \ with a heart they could pry from its chest. The two growled at her, advancing.\
  \ Utterly fearless. Like they completely believed the combined fifty pounds of them\
  \ could take out a full-grown warrior.</p> \n      <p>Wind stirred Amiri’s hair.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Or maybe they were fearless for another reason.</p> \n      <p>Amiri\
  \ threw herself to the side the second before a massive beast slammed into the rock\
  \ where she’d been standing. It whirled in a storm of fur and feathers and flashing\
  \ claws, a howl of rage in its throat.</p> \n      <table class=\"image\" align=\"\

  \  </table> \n      <br> \n      <p>She let out an oath. The thing was <em>massive</em>,\
  \ bigger than any peryton she'd seen—or heard of. Its ragged gray fur was striped\
  \ with scars and liberally stained with blood. Bits of dried gore hung like macabre\
  \ ornaments from its broad antlers, and when it spread its wings, they blocked out\
  \ the sky, casting Amiri in shadow.</p> \n      <p>Amiri grinned. This was more\
  \ like it. She sheathed her dagger. Planted her feet. And gripped the hilt of her\
  \ massive sword. Its weight strained her shoulders, pulled at her arms. But she\
  \ could feel the familiar, welcome heat uncoiling through her veins. That bitter\
  \ taste was on her tongue and her heart raced with that mix of danger and eagerness\
  \ and fury—fury that this creature would dare to face her. Fury it would think it\
  \ could stand against her strength and blade. That it would think her <em>prey</em>.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>“Come on, then!” she screamed at the beast. It rose on its hind legs,\
  \ beating its great wings and sending blasts of wind that tore the loose rocks and\
  \ pebbles from the hillside, sending them tumbling.</p> \n      <p>An arrow hissed\
  \ through the air. It struck the peryton’s flank with a dull, meaty thud. It howled\
  \ in rage and pain, its attention twisting away from Amiri. Toward the young woman\
  \ standing a hundred feet away, feet braced, setting another arrow to her quiver.\
  \ A young man crouched next to her. They wore hunters’ leathers, and by the matching\
  \ red-gold shade of their hair and their angular features, they looked to be brother\
  \ and sister.</p> \n      <p>The peryton leapt for the young woman. Amiri screamed\
  \ out a curse and threw herself after. The girl loosed another arrow, but the peryton’\
  s leap had startled her, and it went wide.</p> \n      <p>Amiri knew she wouldn’\
  t make it to the pair in time. Knew the girl’s hands, quick and sure as they were,\
  \ weren’t quick enough to nock another arrow. Nothing would stop the creature’s\
  \ murderous dive. Unless—</p> \n      <p>The man lifted his hands. The air seemed\
  \ to bend and fold in front of his palms and a crack like thunder boomed out. The\
  \ peryton’s charge broke. It slewed away in the air, snarling in pain and shock.\
  \ The edge of the blast of sound tore past Amiri, slamming into her shoulder, leaving\
  \ her ears ringing.</p> \n      <p>The peryton climbed into the air with powerful\
  \ beats of its wings. Amiri leapt the last few feet to the rock where the two youths\
  \ stood.</p> \n      <p>“It’s coming back around,” she warned.</p> \n      <p>“\
  I can see that.” the young woman snapped, her gaze tracking the beast as it rose,\
  \ as it turned.</p> \n      <p>It seemed to hesitate. Its gaze shifted away from\
  \ the trio, tracking higher up the mountain slope.</p> \n      <p>Then Amiri heard\
  \ it. Not the scrape and skitter of a few dislodged stones, but a deep, desultory\
  \ rumbling. She looked up just as, high above, the mountainside gave way.</p> \n\
  \      <p>“Rockslide!” the young man cried. The peryton let out a warbling howl\
  \ and dove, but not at the three of them this time—toward its cubs, their half-feathered\
  \ wings useless to take them out of the path of the rapidly growing avalanche of\
  \ stone. It swept them up in its hind talons and angled away in seconds as Amiri\
  \ and the other two sprinted down the slope.</p> \n      <p>“Don’t suppose that\
  \ magic of yours can stop a rockslide?” Amiri shouted over the growing din.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>“Just start them, apparently.” he tossed back with a reckless grin,\
  \ and Amiri couldn’t help but answer it.</p> \n      <p>Over his shoulder she spotted\
  \ it: a blot of darkness—a cave entrance.</p> \n      <p>“There.” she said, pointing.\
  \ The two didn’t need her to explain. The sister got there first but she stopped,\
  \ waited as her brother reached her and dove past before she flitted in after him.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>The dust cloud riding the front edge of the avalanche swept over Amiri,\
  \ blotting out her vision and swallowing the light. She threw herself toward the\
  \ cave opening just as the rockslide hit.</p> \n      <p>There was no light, only\
  \ darkness and furious sound, as if the whole mountain was coming apart overhead.\
  \ Amiri scrambled back from the entrance. Stones rained down. Above her sounded\
  \ a horrible grinding and groaning—then a crack. The cave entrance was giving way.\
  \ Amiri roared, bracing herself beneath her sword, as if she could hold the whole\
  \ mountain up.</p> \n      <p>The roof of the cave collapsed over her.</p> \n  \
