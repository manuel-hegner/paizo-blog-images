  \ itemprop=\"description\">This week marks the anniversary of my sixth year working\
  \ at Paizo and overseeing the organized play content development. Perhaps it's fitting\
  \ then that not only do this month's Pathfinder Society scenarios deal with ancient\
  \ places, but they also pertain to subjects that intrigued me even before I moved\
  \ to Seattle to share adventures with so many groups worldwide: archaeology and\
  \ the sorcerer Hao Jin.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\">\n     <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderSociety/20190220-Sklarjpg\"\

  ></a> \n     <p><i>Illustration by Michele Giorgi</i></p>\n    </div> \n    <p>We\
  \ had a blast coming up with the premise for <i><a href=\"/products/btq01wlm?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-1014-Debt-to-the-Quah\"\
  >Pathfinder Society Scenario #10-14: Debt to the Quah</a>,</i> a Tier 3-7 scenario\
  \ that Adrian Ng executed beautifully as the author. Although many Pathfinders are\
  \ capable scholars, there are the bad eggs—unscrupulous academics willing to do\
  \ anything to become famous, self-absorbed explorers ready to misinterpret an ancient\
  \ site to promote their pet theories, rage-fueled warriors using the Society as\
  \ an excuse to swing greatswords at others, and reckless mages who hurl fireballs\
  \ while fighting in libraries. The nature of a tabletop RPG like Pathfinder lends\
  \ itself to explosive combats and the PCs who can survive those encounters, yet\
  \ even though I comfortably acknowledge this, there's a part of me that dies a little\
  \ whenever RPGs and video games show an archaeologist character blowing up ruins\
  \ or hacking apart a priceless fresco to see if there's a secret passage on the\
  \ other side. Due to my archaeology background, I really enjoy including an adventure\
  \ every year or so that delves into archaeology's nuances and the ramifications\
  \ of casting <i>ice storm</i> in a carefully preserved tomb.</p> \n    <p>The Pathfinder\
  \ Society has made some positive inroads with the generally standoffish Shoanti\
  \ people, such as in <i><a href=\"/products/btpy8u8s?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-4-06-The-Green-Market\"\
  >Pathfinder Society Scenario #4-06: Green Market</a></i> and <i><a href=\"/products/btpy9tl5?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-822-Wrath-of-the-Fleshwarped-Queen\"\
  >Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-22: Wrath of the Fleshwarped Queen</a></i>. As <i>Debt\
  \ to the Quah</i> begins, though, the PCs learn that a former Pathfinder not only\
  \ looted one of the Shoantis' most revered sites, but he also mistakenly presented\
  \ it as a Thassilonian ruin in the latest Pathfinder Chronicle. Imagine how upset\
  \ the combined Shoanti clans must be to learn of this desecration through a scholarly\
  \ journal that adds insult by misattributing their accomplishments to another culture?\
  \ It's the PCs' job to play damage control. Not only do they meet with the many\
  \ Shoanti quahs' representatives to repair damaged relationships, but they'll also\
  \ need to repair the damaged tomb their colleague left in ruins. Fortunately, the\
  \ PCs have a few allies among the Shoanti, including the half-elf Cousin to All,\
  \ illustrated by Michele Giorgi. This is a really fun adventure that delves into\
  \ Shaonti lore that I'm sure you'll enjoy.</p> \n    <p>So even though archaeology's\
  \ considered a \"destructive science,\" just remember not to take that too literally\
  \ the next time you want to chop your way through a wall with that adamantine greataxe.\
  \ Looting is a natural part of RPGs, but let this be my reminder to respect archaeological\
  \ sites overall in real life. It might seem cool to climb that pyramid or swipe\
  \ some pottery sherds, but only by holding ourselves to a higher standard can we\
  \ preserve and understand the past for future generations.</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  ></a> \n     <p><i>Illustration by Leonardo Santanna</i></p>\n    </div> \n    <p>In\
  \ <i><a href=\"/products/btq01wln?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-1015-Tapestrys-Trial\"\
  >Pathfinder Society Scenario #10-15: Tapestry's Trial</a>,</i> a Tier 7-11 scenario\
  \ by Alex Greenshields, we are approaching the end of the Hao Jin Tapestry storyline,\
  \ and we're doing it in a big way. Within the past year, the Society learned that\
  \ the museum demiplane created by the legendary sorcerer Hao Jin was collapsing\
  \ during <i><a href=\"/products/btpya1xz?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-1000-The-Hao-Jin-Cataclysm\"\
  >Pathfinder Society Special #10-00: The Hao Jin Cataclysm</a></i>. The Society's\
  \ extended the demiplane's life long enough to perform salvage archaeology jobs\
  \ in <i><a href=\"/products/btq01vpr?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-1011-The-Hao-Jin-Hierophant\"\
  >Pathfinder Society Scenario #10-11: The Hao Jin Hierophant</a></i> and <i><a href=\"\
  /products/btq01wkq?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-1013-Fragments-of-Antiquity\">Pathfinder\
  \ Society Scenario #10-13: Fragments of Antiquity</a></i>, but new cracks are appearing.\
  \ The Pathfinders have one last option to save the tapestry: finding and enlisting\
  \ the creator herself, none other than the storied Ruby Phoenix, Hao Jin.</p> \n\
  \    <p>This scenario's been percolating for more than half the campaign's life,\
  \ ever since Mark Moreland mentioned where Hao Jin's been for so long. Not only\
  \ are the PCs traveling to Axis to meet Hao Jin in person, but they're also going\
  \ to learn so much more about the Ruby Phoenix's past in the process. Add to that\
  \ the strange possibilities for adventure in the Eternal City—including this eclectic\
  \ inevitable illustrated by Leonardo Santanna—and you have one heck of a scenario.\
  \ I'm reticent to share too much more than that just to avoid spoilers.</p> \n \
  \   <p>Well, I'll explore one element just a little more. Especially in Season 10,\
  \ the team's been really interested in providing the players an opportunity to understand\
  \ and respond to some major NPCs' ongoing stories, particularly NPCs who have been\
  \ around for 5 or more years and so have inspired some strong feelings. I'll leave\
  \ it at the <i>Tapestry's Trial</i> title being a play on words with multiple meanings,\
  \ which we explore considerably in the scenario. I hope you enjoy the final encounter\
  \ as much as I do.</p> \n    <p style=\"clear: both;\">John Compton<br> <i>Organized\
