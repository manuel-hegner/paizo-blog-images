  \ That is insane, and don't ever do it. There. Don't say no one ever warned you.</p>\
  \ \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">But after sending the <a href=\"/products/btpy92zj\"\
  >Pathfinder Adventure Card Game: Skull &amp; Shackles Base Set</a>, its <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy92zk\"><i>Character Add-On Deck</i></a>, the <a href=\"/products/btpy95dj\"\
  ><i>S&amp;S Adventure Decks</i></a> #2—6, and the first seven <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lg1o\"\
  ><i>Class Decks</i></a> to the printer, I have some observations that I'd like to\
  \ share. I'll ask Tanis, Chad, and Gaby to go deeper into the details of each product\
  \ in the coming months, but I'd like PACG fans to hear some more global thoughts\
  \ from me.</span></p> \n    <p>First off, we're all in. This is an immense product\
  \ line now, and we're going to do everything we can to keep it on your gaming table.\
  \ We're deep in design of the third Adventure Path, and we're plotting out the fourth.\
  \ Our job is to keep giving you reasons to keep playing, and we take that job very\
  \ seriously.</p> \n    <p>That means not resting on our laurels. We don't want a\
  \ carbon copy of Rise of the Runelords with some different chrome on top. Skull\
  \ &amp; Shackles will require you to strategize differently, to use skills and make\
  \ checks differently, to build your decks differently, and to advance your character\
  \ differently. Where Runelords had one scenario per adventure that was atypical\
  \ in its format, S&amp;S has quite a bit more. You won't see what's coming, and\
  \ that's going to make it harder to win the game, and we hope you'll like that.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>We also want you to see yourself differently. Instead of just our base\
  \ 11 iconic characters, these products will get us up to 40 uniquely named characters—\
  and even the new versions of familiar faces will play differently from those of\
  \ Runelords. As of August, you'll have more than 100 role cards available. And there's\
  \ a personality shift as well: As a general rule, our base 11 iconics are pretty\
  \ nice people. Not all of our new characters are nice. Some are borderline nasty.\
  \ We want you to be able to play whatever you want.</p> \n    <p>We're going to\
  \ give those characters a lot to play. The weekly organized play scenarios will\
  \ roll out starting in the summer, and the character/scenario combinatorics are\
  \ off the charts. (Seriously, we made those charts, and we're off of them.) We care\
  \ a whole lot about our friendly local gaming stores and game conventions, and want\
  \ to bring our brand of entertainment to all those places. Wherever you're surrounded\
  \ by gamers, we'll be there.</p> \n    <p>We're making more things people want for\
  \ the game. There are more S&amp;S promos, including <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lfzp\"\
  >our first and most insane promo character</a>. Ultra Pro is making <a href=\"/products/btpy918a\"\
  >character</a> <a href=\"/products/btpy918b\">mats</a>, <a href=\"/products/btpy95hg\"\
  >card sleeves</a>, <a href=\"/paizo/news/v5748eaic9rx9\">adventure mats, and cases</a>\
  \ for the serious PACG player, all of which have <a href=\"/products/btpy8x6n\"\
  >subscriber discounts</a>. These definitely change the play experience in positive\
  \ ways. There are more fun things in the works, but Vic would hit me with a gaffi\
  \ stick if I said anything about them.</p> \n    <p>We're also making a commitment\
  \ to a living rulebook. We've now got more than 1,500 uniquely named cards for the\
  \ game (roughly equal to the first four years of Magic: The Gathering), and they\
  \ all interact in fascinating ways. So that means the rulebook needs to handle everything\
  \ the game throws at it. That means it's getting bigger, and is unlikely to get\
  \ smaller any time soon. It'll be updated a few times a year, and each set's rulebook\
  \ will supersede the previous set's rulebook, modulo any rules unique to that set\
  \ (e.g., S&amp;S's ships). We want everything to work with everything else, and\
  \ so we'll stay on top of the forums and address any issues people come across,\
  \ changing the rules as needed. If you make that kind of commitment to us, we're\
  \ going to make a similar commitment to you.</p> \n    <p>So that's it. After almost\
  \ 2,000 cards passed through my hands in less than a month, I can see the future\
  \ of this game. If you like it as much as I do, it'll be very bright indeed.</p>\
