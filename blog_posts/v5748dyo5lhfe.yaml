  \ <p class=\"date\">by Gary Kloster</p> \n   <h2>Chapter Four: Great Beasts</h2>\
  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">The grootslang\
  \ coiled in the ruins of its egg and hissed. Its body was thick and muscular, like\
  \ a snake's, armored with red and dull golden scales and supported at one end by\
  \ two legs. Each leg was as wide as Jiri, and ended in thick claws. From the heavy\
  \ chest between those legs a long neck stretched, ending in a blunt, triangular\
  \ head. It looked like a viper's head, with slitted yellow eyes and a wide mouth\
  \ lined with fangs, but from either side of that mouth grew three sharp tusks, six\
  \ in all. A forked tongue flickered out of the grootslang's mouth, tasting the air\
  \ before sliding back over one of the tusks, stripping the blood and tissue from\
  \ it.</p> \n    <p>The grootslang blinked at them, then reached out with one claw,\
  \ pinning Taba's broken corpse. Its head dipped and it bit into the remains and\
  \ pulled back, tearing the body apart. Jiri shuddered at the terrible ripping sound,\
  \ but she forced herself to watch, to not take her eyes off the beast, to not turn\
  \ and run.</p> \n    <p>\"Dahren. Do something!\" Khair had drawn his sword, a thin\
  \ thing that looked like a pretty toy compared to the grootslang's tusks. </p> \n\
  \    <p>\"What?\" Dahren asked, his eyes wide, darting from Khair, to Jiri, then\
  \ back to the beast.</p> \n    <p>\"You're a mage, cast something!\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  What?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Something that will get us out of your stupid idea alive!\"\
  </p> \n    <p>The grootslang gathered up the rest of Taba and bolted him down as\
  \ Jiri watched, her stomach clenching. A man turned to nothing but meat in a moment,\
  \ and now that meat was gone too.</p> \n    <p>Fire blossomed in Jiri's hand, bright\
  \ and hot, and the monster looked at her, tilting its head. Then it moved.</p> \n\
  \    <p>It shot like a dart from a blowgun, moving too fast for something that was\
  \ the size of a crocodile, and it was in the water, its scaled body splitting the\
  \ river, and when Jiri threw her fire it only hissed against the splashing surface,\
  \ doing nothing to the beast.</p> \n    <p>\"Is it gone?\" Khair said, his sword\
  \ still up.</p> \n    <p>\"Gone. Gone, and all that coin, all that time spent wading\
  \ through this miserable jungle, that's gone too.\" Dahren spat at the river. \"\
  Curse this place and everything that lives in it. The gods should burn it all.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Jiri ignored him, her clenched hands still hot. For once, the fire\
  \ that she had so much trouble containing felt insufficient. \"It's not gone,\"\
  \ she said, watching the river, listening. The jungle had gone too quiet around\
  \ them, birds and monkeys silent, the only sounds the hum of insects and the rush\
  \ of the water. </p> \n    <p>\"Where is it?\" Dahren said, stepping back from the\
  \ river, toward her. His hands moved, and he spoke, the words slurred and sibilant,\
  \ and Jiri felt the air near Dahren grow prickly as he gathered his magic.</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"I don't—\" Jiri started, then she heard it, the sound of mud shifting\
  \ behind her, and spun. </p> \n    <p>The grootslang was there, rearing up out of\
  \ a shallow pool that stretched across the mud behind her. Far too shallow to hide\
  \ the beast, but Jiri remembered what Oza had taught her: water was a door to the\
  \ grootslang, one it could pass through, vanishing and reappearing where it willed.\
  \ The beast reared up over Jiri, balancing on its coils, its tusks shining white\
  \ as bone, white as the fangs of its gaping mouth. Without thinking, Jiri threw\
  \ her fire at it, striking the monster in its broad chest. </p> \n    <p>The flames\
  \ hissed across the grootslang's scales, barely marking them.</p> \n    <p>\"Ah,\
  \ heat. Pain.\" The words hissed free from the grootslang's mouth, though its jaws\
  \ didn't move and its tongue flickered, tasting the air. \"I had expected... more.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"It talks?\" Khair was moving back, his sword up, his eyes wide.\
  \ </p> \n    <p>\"Grootslangs are cunning,\" Jiri said. Fire filled her hand again,\
  \ but its heat felt useless.</p> \n    <p>\"It just hatched,\" Dahren said from\
  \ close behind her.</p> \n    <p>\"My mother shared her thoughts. My father his\
  \ voice.\" The grootslang tilted its head, staring down at them. \"I've been listening\
  \ to you speak for weeks as I chipped my way out of my shell. Stupid, greedy words,\
  \ but they comforted me. Because I knew you were out there, and I was so hungry.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Jiri stepped back, putting worthless space between her and the beast,\
  \ but Dahren was there. The man grabbed her and she felt his hand, crackling with\
  \ the threat of magic, pressed against her back. </p> \n    <p>\"No! Dahren shouted.\
  \ \"Not us. Not me or my companion.\"</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\">\n     <a\

  ><img src=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-TheGem-Grootslang_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Baby's hungry.</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>\"Why not?\" Dark amusement\
  \ filled the grootslang's words. \"Because of you, human flesh was my first food.\
  \ I found it very satisfying.\"</p> \n    <p>\"And we can give you more.\" Dahren\
  \ shook Jiri. \"Take her. A morsel, I know, but her village is close. We'll lead\
  \ you there to eat your fill.\"</p> \n    <p>\"You—\" Jiri started, but Dahren cut\
  \ her curse off with a wrench of her arm.</p> \n    <p>\"A whole village,\" the\
  \ grootslang hissed. \"That's what you offer, for your lives?\" The beast lowered\
  \ its head, staring at Jiri, at Dahren. \"A sweet gift. Would you lead them to me?\
  \ Would you portion out their flesh with your own hands and offer it to me, like\
  \ a sacrifice?\" </p> \n    <p>\"Yes,\" Dahren said. \"Just let me live.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>The grootslang blinked once, slow, and laughter spilled from its jaws, low\
  \ and terrible. \"I think you would, you miserable creature. I think you would.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Me too,\" Jiri growled, and she spun. She ignored the pain as he\
  \ pulled at her arm, and the mud splattered across her made her slick. Ripping herself\
  \ out of Dahren's grip, Jiri pulled away from the man. She could see the blue glow\
  \ that limned his fingers, bright even in the sunlight, and she threw herself back,\
  \ raising her own hand as she did, and threw her fire.</p> \n    <p>The flames caught\
  \ the man in his beard and the oiled hair flared up. Dahren's lunge after her faltered,\
  \ his hands flailing as he beat at the fire racing across his chest and up toward\
  \ his face. Jiri lurched through the mud as fast as she could, dimly aware of Dahren\
  \ shrieking curses, of Khair turning and running, splashing through mud and water\
  \ as he raced downstream, his sword flashing as his arms pumped. What she was watching,\
  \ though, was the grootslang.</p> \n    <p>The beast laughed again, reared up and\
  \ then drove itself down. Its tusks slammed into Dahren's back, pinning him to the\
  \ ground. Jiri's hair rose as magic and electricity flared out of the man, tiny\
  \ bolts of lighting forking through the mud. The grootslang barely seemed to notice,\
  \ and lifted its head.</p> \n    <p>Dahren came up with it, screaming. His clothes\
  \ were soaked in blood, and the spear-sharp tusks of the beast jutted from his belly\
  \ and chest. He writhed on them, trying to get away, and then jerked when the grootslang's\
  \ jaws clenched shut on his back with an awful tearing sound. The grootslang bit\
  \ again, and Dahren fell, legs to one side, chest and head to the other.</p> \n\
  \    <p>The grootslang looked at Jiri, blood dripping from its tusks. \"If you're\
  \ to scream and run, you best start now. It won't take me long to finish this.\"\
  \ It dropped its jaws down, plucking flesh bone from the mud, but Jiri had already\
  \ turned away.</p> \n    <p>Where?</p> \n    <p>Thoughts flared through her, desperate,\
  \ useless. The grootslang was faster than her, and with its ability to pass through\
  \ water there was almost no chance she could get away. There was only one thing\
  \ she could do.</p> \n    <p>Jiri ran for the river, dove in and started swimming.\
  \ For once, she didn't look for crocodiles. There was something worse behind her\
  \ now, and she expected that at any moment it would appear under her, rising out\
  \ of the water, snapping her down. When she reached the far bank, she stumbled out,\
  \ shocked to still be alive. The other side of the river was empty now, the place\
  \ where the beast had been marked only with its tracks in the mud and Dahren's blood.\
  \ </p> \n    <p>Maybe—but she cut off that thought.</p> \n    <p>She couldn't escape.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Useless, ugly, snake-thing! Stupid, scaly, animal! Eater of idiots!\
  \ You'll never catch me!\" Jiri started forward, running as fast as she could, gasping\
  \ for the spirits to help her. In answer, the brush and vines parted around her,\
  \ opening a space in the green wall of the jungle, letting her run. And maybe it\
  \ was an answer to her prayers, too, that she heard a low laugh coming from the\
  \ water behind her.</p> \n    <p style=\"text-align: center;\">∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n    <p>Jiri\
  \ didn't make it far.</p> \n    <p>She stopped, breathing hard, staring at the lake\
  \ in front of her. It was thin and curved, probably an old loop of the river that\
  \ had been cut off. Now it stood before her, water still as a mirror. She started\
  \ moving down its bank, trying to get around it, but she hadn't gone five steps\
  \ before the beast found her.</p> \n    <p>\"Eater of idiots.\" The grootslang reared\
  \ up from the lake, its blunt claws digging into the soft red dirt of the bank.\
  \ Its eyes stared down at her over the thicket of its tusks. \"I like that name.\
  \ I like that idea.\"</p> \n    <p>Jiri raised her hands, fire gathering in them.\
  \ Maybe if she caught the thing in an eye, it would blind it, slow it. Let her get\
  \ away, so she could lead it farther. She threw the fire, and it struck the beast\
  \ square in its face.</p> \n    <p>The grootslang shook its head, its low laugh\
  \ a hiss. \"And you called me useless,\" it said, rearing up, its tusks flashing\
  \ in the sunlight. Jiri whispered to the ancestors she was about to meet, gathering\
  \ her fire one last time.</p> \n    <p>Because of that, she missed the water moving\
  \ behind the beast. Pulling in, rising into a column thicker than the grootslang.\
  \ She saw it rear up behind the monster, a huge liquid shape, something like a snake\
  \ but with a vaguely human face and a thousand shifting tendrils that constantly\
  \ rose and fell from its surface. Those tendrils lashed out at the grootslang, wrapped\
  \ around its scaly body and pulled it up, away from Jiri.</p> \n    <p>The beast\
  \ hissed and writhed, its tail smashing through the column of water, splashing,\
  \ but the elemental held it close, kept its tusks and jaws and claws away. The grootslang\
  \ fought, trying to twist like a snake in the elemental's grip, and it didn't notice\
  \ the massive tiger racing out of the trees toward it until the cat's claws were\
  \ digging furrows through the scales of the grootslang's belly.</p> \n    <p>The\
  \ grootslang shrieked, its writhing struggle scattering the dark-red blood that\
  \ flowed from its wounds. It whipped its head around, glaring with hate at the great\
  \ cat that stood on the bank in front of it, and its tail slapped out. The tiger\
  \ snarled, its gray-shot muzzle pulling back from huge teeth as it ducked the blow,\
  \ then reared up and slapped at the grootslang's belly again. The cat fell back,\
  \ and as it moved it changed, drew in on itself, fur and fang swallowed by skin\
  \ and mud cloth.</p> \n    <p>\"Eater of idiots,\" Oza growled. \"Start with your\
  \ own tail then, grootslang.\"</p> \n    <p>The grootslang stopped moving, hung\
  \ limp in the water elemental's constantly shifting embrace. \"Who are you?\" it\
  \ hissed.</p> \n    <p>\"I'm the one who claims this territory, and all in it. I'm\
  \ the one that will tear you open and leave your guts for the gars if I ever find\
  \ you near here again.\" Oza glared up at the beast, his brown eyes shifting yellow,\
  \ his hands twisting toward claws. \"Do you understand that?\"</p> \n    <p>The\
  \ grootslang hissed, but its head dipped.</p> \n    <p>\"Go. Find a hunting ground\
  \ far from here. And if you ever see a human again, think carefully before you strike.\
  \ We are not all easy meals.\"</p> \n    <p>The grootslang's tongue flickered, but\
  \ it said nothing as the elemental shifted around it, placing its liquid body in\
  \ front of Oza and Jiri as it let the beast go. The grootslang slipped into the\
  \ water and vanished, gone, leaving only the reek of its blood behind.</p> \n  \
  \  <p>Jiri stood shaking in the mud, staring at her teacher. </p> \n    <p>\"Hadzi\
  \ couldn't have reached you that fast.\"</p> \n    <p> \"I never saw Hadzi. The\
  \ wara sent for me, after hearing that you and the boy and his father were swept\
  \ away. I came back as fast as I could. Just fast enough, it seems.\" Oza raised\
  \ his hand, touched it to the necklace of carved fetishes that he wore, and bowed\
  \ his head to the elemental. The shifting column of water bobbed in acknowledgment\
  \ of his thanks and slowly collapsed back into the lake, leaving barely a ripple\
  \ behind.</p> \n    <p>Oza held out his hand, and Jiri took it, felt his skin cool\
  \ against her palm, still hot with the fire she had been ready to throw before she\
  \ died.</p> \n    <p>\"I—\" Jiri shuddered, and made herself breathe. She wanted\
  \ to collapse, or to throw herself into Oza's arms, but she made herself stand still,\
  \ straight. \"I didn't catch Thirty Trees on fire. But I'm not sure this went well.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"You're not?\" Oza said. \"Boro is well, along with all of those\
  \ that had gathered around the wreck. Fumo and Hadzi are safe. And you.\" Oza looked\
  \ around at the jungle that surrounded them. \"I almost didn't make it, almost didn't\
  \ find you. Because you didn't run toward the village, or toward the city where\
  \ I was. You ran to nowhere. You were leading that thing away, weren't you? From\
  \ the village, from the city.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I wasn't strong enough to stop it,\"\
  \ Jiri said. \"I couldn't do anything else.\"</p> \n    <p>\"You did all that you\
  \ could.\"</p> \n    <p>\"All that I could,\" Jiri said. \"And it wasn't enough.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Jiri,\" Oza said. \"The beast is gone. Thirty Trees is safe. And\
  \ you're still alive. All that you could was just exactly enough.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Oh,\" she said, and the vast, sudden relief she felt at his words made her legs\
  \ weak. She gripped his hand tighter. \"Can we go home, then?\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Yes.\" Oza began to walk back, the jungle bending around him, the spirits of the\
  \ plants honoring him with a clear path. </p> \n    <p>Jiri followed, suddenly very,\
  \ very tired. But a thought snagged at her. \"Are you angry at Fumo?\"</p> \n  \
  \  <p>\"We will have words,\" Oza said, his voice suddenly ominous, traced, it seemed,\
  \ with a tiger's growl.</p> \n    <p>\"Good,\" Jiri said. \"Can I watch?\"</p> \n\
