  \ Venture-Officers On Board</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Monday, January 23, 2012</p>\
  \ \n   <p>With the coming of the new year, we continue to grow Pathfinder Society\
  \ at a tremendous rate. With that, I want to make sure we have good leadership in\
  \ place so that continue to grow and expand. Over the past few months, we added\
  \ three more Venture-Captains who have not yet formally been introduced, and today\
  \ we are adding even more to the growing list of Venture-Captains.</p> \n   <p>I\
  \ am excited to add three new areas to our Venture-Captain regions. The first is\
  \ Kansas City, Missouri. Seth Brummond fills an important role in an area ripe for\
  \ growth and that has been wanting a Venture-Captain. Not only will he be serving\
  \ western Missouri, but will also be able to help organize and coordinate growth\
  \ of Pathfinder Society in eastern Kansas.</p> \n   <p>The second new area is Albany,\
  \ New York. The capital region of New York has seen an explosion of growth in Pathfinder\
  \ Society activity over the past several years and I look forward to seeing the\
  \ direction Evan Whitefield takes Pathfinder Society.</p> \n   <p>The third new\
  \ area is Houston, Texas. I know that Houston has seen sporadic Pathfinder Society\
  \ play and is just waiting for someone to step in and get things organized. Robert\
  \ Vaughn is just the person to hit the ground running as we watch the Houston Lodge\
  \ grow.</p> \n   <p>We also have had two Venture-Captains step down due to real-life\
  \ responsibilities. I wish fair winds and following seas to both Rene Ayala from\
  \ Arizona and Neil Shackelton from Toronto. Both of them have done an outstanding\
  \ job establishing a foothold for Pathfinder Society in their regions and the new\
  \ Venture-Captains have big shoes to fill.</p> \n   <p>Assuming Rene’s responsibilities,\
  \ Jason Leonard has been appointed as Venture-Captain of Arizona. Assuming Neil’\
  s responsibilities, Robert Trifts has been appointed as Venture-Captain of the Ontario\
  \ region of Canada.</p> \n   <p>In addition to the new Venture-Captains above, we\
  \ have added the following Venture-Lieutenants to help some of our current Venture-Captains\
  \ reach out to areas in their regions that are either too far away to cover on a\
  \ regular basis, or are too numerous to cover at all. They include the following:</p>\
  \ \n   <ul>\n    <li>Albany, NY – Brett McLean</li> \n    <li>Arizona – Cody Lucas</li>\
  \ \n    <li>Central/Southern Illinois – Shaun Burton</li> \n    <li>Indiana – Chris\
  \ Bonnet</li> \n    <li>Oregon – Todd Tepper</li> \n    <li>San Diego, CA – Terence\
  \ Brawley</li> \n    <li>Virginia – Jeremy Hitchcock</li> \n    <li>Wisconsin –\
  \ Matthew Starch</li> \n    <li>Melbourne, Australia – Ryan Koetsveld</li> \n  \
  \  <li>Ontario, Canada – Jeff Mahood</li> \n    <li>Denmark – Jacob Trier</li>\n\
  \   </ul> \n   <p>We are still in need of additional Venture-Captains in some regions\
  \ and you can find the list <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/about/regionalCoordinators\"\
  >here</a>. If you are interested in applying, please contact me after reviewing\
  \ the application process in the previous link.</p> \n   <p>Mike Brock<br> <i>Pathfinder\
