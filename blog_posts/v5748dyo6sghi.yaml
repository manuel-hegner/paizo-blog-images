  \ \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Almost one month done with 2019 and the organized\
  \ play team's chugging away at our to-do list. Meetings over the past few weeks\
  \ yielded results such as Year 2 storylines for Starfinder Society, and factions/storylines\
  \ for the next iteration of Pathfinder Society. We've spent a goodly amount of our\
  \ meetings talking about player feedback we collated from a variety of places -\
  \ forums, surveys, convention discussions, and Facebook. Community commentary allows\
  \ us the opportunity to craft a program that appeals to our player base. To all\
  \ those community members who share their opinions, thank you for helping us shape\
  \ the program.</p> \n    <p>Speaking of feedback and programs. February 1st launches\
  \ the next installment of the Regional Support Program (RSP) for use in locations\
  \ not qualifying for convention support. This year's program includes Pathfinder\
  \ Society and Starfinder Society boons for players and GMs. As of Friday, all new\
  \ boons issued will be from the 2019 pack. To enable GMs to complete the 2018 boon,\
  \ games run from Friday may either check off a box on the new 2019 boon or continue\
  \ to check boxes on your 2018 boon each time you run a game at a Regional Support-qualifying\
  \ venue.</p> \n    <p>New this year is a program for Online Support (OSP). We've\
  \ been working on this since spinning up the online region, but it took some time\
  \ to formulate a plan and then shepherd it through the appropriate channels. When\
  \ discussing how best to support our online games, one of our biggest concerns involved\
  \ supporting a player/GM that participated in both physical and online games. Using\
  \ the same program did not seem to further the programs goals of incentivizing play/GMing.\
  \ Instead of utilizing the existing RSP program, the team decided to curate a different\
  \ package of player and GM boons available exclusively online. The requirements\
  \ to be an OSP event include being open to public registration and ineligible for\
  \ convention support.</p> \n    <p>We solicited feedback from Regional Venture-Coordinator\
  \ Jesse Davis and his team of venture-officers on how to best implement OSP boon\
  \ distribution. As they already manage boon distribution for online conventions,\
  \ the OSP process isn't much different. The online venture-officer team will log\
  \ the OSP games on a tracker, randomly allocate boons to players and recording GM\
  \ participation. Once the GM completes 6 games, they qualify for Tier 1 on the boon.\
  \ Tier 2 is 12 games run and Tier 3 is 24 games run. Boons are limited to one per\
  \ player per quarter and one per GM per year.</p> \n    <p>If you are running an\
  \ online event and would like to be part of the OSP, please reach out to the venture-captain\
  \ for your venue (PbP, VTT, etc.). If you are unsure who that is, check out the\
  \ online section of the <a href=\"/organizedplay/coordinators\">regional coordinators\
  \ page.</a></p> \n    <p>Besides meetings and releasing the OSP and updating the\
  \ RSP, the team has another update on Additional Resources. From the pen of Organized\
  \ Play Lead Developer John Compton…</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>The team's\
  \ been hard at work developing January's and February's scenarios, outlining several\
  \ of our final First Edition adventures, and working out the details on our next\
  \ organized play season (including some really great discussions about factions\
  \ based on your survey feedback). We've also submitted the sanctioning documents\
  \ to War for the Crown Adventure Path and for Pathfinder Module: Seers of the Drowned\
  \ City, and we're expecting those to go live alongside an upcoming blog. But as\
  \ you can tell from the blog title, we've been reviewing some fun Player Companion\
  \ books—<a href=\"/products/btq01vb0?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Martial-Arts-Handbook\"\
  >Pathfinder Player Companion: Martial Artist's Handbook</a> from November and <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btq01w1y?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Wilderness-Origins\">Pathfinder\
  \ Player Companion: Wilderness Origins</a> from January—for the <a href=\"/pathfindersociety/rpg/additional\"\
  >Additional Resources</a> and <a href=\"/pathfindersociety/rpg/clarifications\"\
  >Campaign Clarifications</a> documents, both of which are queued to be updated on\
  \ the site in the coming days.</p> \n     <p>In the meantime, I'd like to point\
  \ out some of the updates coming up elsewhere in the Additional Resources document.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>Adventurer's Guide 2:</b> In general, we've been treating the \"\
  Equipment\" entries of new books as though they cover items of all stripes, mundane\
  \ and magical, but there seemed to be some ambiguity on whether or not the magic\
  \ items on page 23 were legal. That's been clarified, and those improvised weapon\
  \ magic items are legal.</p> \n     <p><b>Plane-Hopper's Handbook:</b> Somehow the\
  \ geniekin heritages didn't make it into the Additional Resources in December (I\
  \ suspect my mind lumped them with the Alternate Racial Traits entry). Those have\
  \ been formally added.</p> \n     <p><b>Ganzis and Planar Adventures:</b> When we\
  \ first examined the new oddities in Plane-Hopper's Handbook, we decided that this\
  \ would be a good opportunity to open up more oddities choices to ganzi PCs. That\
  \ spurred a review of the Planar Adventures options, too, which led to two of them\
  \ being banned. What we hadn't remembered at the time was that a boon had opened\
  \ up access to these already. We don't want to retroactively ban those oddities\
  \ and disrupt some existing characters, so instead we're revising the benefit provided\
  \ on the Touched by Chaos boon (specifically the 2018 GM Boon #2, according to my\
  \ records), replacing the second paragraph that cites replacing the quibble ability.\
  \ You'll also find that the quibbles in Planar Adventures are now all listed as\
  \ legal.</p> \n     <ul> \n      <li><b>Previous Benefit:</b> Ganzi characters created\
  \ using Pathfinder RPG Planar Adventures as a resource gain quibble as their ganzi\
  \ oddity ability. By combining this boon with another boon that allows you to create\
  \ a ganzi PC, you may replace that PC's quibble or ganzi oddity ability with any\
  \ other ganzi oddity option.</li> \n      <li><b>Revised Benefit:</b> Ganzi characters\
  \ created using Pathfinder RPG Planar Adventures as a resource may select any one\
  \ of the listed oddities. By combining this boon with another boon that allows you\
  \ to create a ganzi PC, you can channel your extraplanar connection in an especially\
  \ powerful way. As a free action, you can record the name of the adventure you are\
  \ playing below this boon to gain a second legal ganzi oddity for the duration of\
  \ the adventure. You can only have two ganzi oddities at a time, and you can only\
  \ gain additional oddities in this way three times.</li> \n     </ul> \n     <p>So,\
  \ as we open up ganzi oddities overall, those who combine the two ganzi boons can\
  \ still gain a limited-use benefit that lets their ganzis show off an especially\
  \ potent extraplanar power.</p> \n     <p>Thanks for your continued help in identifying\
  \ corrections and clarifications in the Additional Resources and Campaign Clarifications\
  \ documents.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Join us next week for our monthly\
  \ update on stars, cons, and travel!</p> \n    <p>Until then—Explore, Report, Cooperate!</p>\
