  \ of Lavender</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Wednesday, July 9, 2008</p> \n   <p>Next\
  \ month, readers of <a href=\"/pathfinder/v5748btpy80i9\"><i> Pathfinder </i>#13</a>\
  \ will meet Saul Vancaskerkin and Clegg Zincher, two scheming crime bosses from\
  \ Varisia's famed pirate paradise, Riddleport. But the premiere entry in the Second\
  \ Darkness Adventure Path isn't the first time the Vancaskerkin family and Boss\
  \ Zincher (<a href=\"/pathfinder/v5748btpy81to\"><i>Pathfinder</i> #14's</a> cover\
  \ boy), have shown up in <i>Pathfinder</i>. Would you believe that both received\
  \ a nod all the way back in <i><a href=\"/pathfinder/v5748btpy7zkr\">Pathfinder</a></i><a\
  \ href=\"/pathfinder/v5748btpy7zkr\"> #1</a>?! Turns out that the Vancaskerkin line\
  \ has been causing trouble in Varisia for some time now, even leading to Orik Vancaskerkin's\
  \ participation in Sandpoint's problems in \"Burnt Offerings\":</p> \n   <blockquote>\
  \ \n    <p> \"After a scam involving a tiefling prostitute, a shifty alchemist,\
  \ and an <i>elixir of love,</i> Orik was forced to flee Riddleport. He's pretty\
  \ sure that Clegg Zincher, the now-dead alchemist's powerful brother, still carries\
  \ a grudge for what Orik did to the alchemist when he discovered, to his horror,\
  \ that the <i>elixir of love</i> was actually just cheap ale laced with lavender.\"\
  \ (<i>Pathfinder</i> #1, pg. 45)</p> \n   </blockquote> \n   <p>While Orik was schlepping\
  \ around Thistletop, though, his brother Verik was getting into no end of trouble\
  \ in Korvosa, serving as member of the city guard (<a href=\"/pathfinder/v5748btpy81xw\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder</i> #8</a>). And all the way back in Riddleport, their dear old dad,\
  \ Saul Vancaskerkin, started cooking up a scheme to reclaim some of his local clout\
  \ (<a href=\"/pathfinder/v5748btpy80i9\"><i>Pathfinder</i> #13</a>). But behind\
  \ many of the Vancaskerkin family's troubles hides a singular tiefling harlot, a\
  \ pretty face with a purple dress and pointed tail named Lavender Lil. In <a href=\"\
  /pathfinder/v5748btpy81x7\"><i>Pathfinder Companion: Second Darkness</i></a>, a\
  \ story that started over a year ago can finally be told:</p> \n   <blockquote>\
  \ \n    <p> \"Like many of the city's tieflings, Lil grew up an orphan in Riddleport.\
  \ She earned her coin by telling stories on street corners, where her fantastical\
  \ tales garnered just enough copper for a bite to eat. Although a gifted storyteller,\
  \ Lil's exotic good looks drew more attention than her tales, and soon a local pimp\
  \ forced her into his flock. </p>\n    <p> \"As she matured, Lil's sultry purple\
  \ eyes and her love for flowers earned her the nickname 'Lavender.' Her talent for\
  \ storytelling matured alongside her looks, and rumors circulated that her grandfather\
  \ was Varisian and her grandmother was a devil-woman. While Lil had no strenuous\
  \ objections to working as a prostitute, she missed the freedom of life on the streets.\
  \ Her dreams never grew grand enough to imagine life as a noble lady, a brave adventurer,\
  \ or even a wife or mother. All Lil wanted was the freedom to claim her own life\
  \ and to manage it, for ill or good.\"</p> \n   </blockquote> \n   <p>Lavender Lil\
  \ appears in the first entry into the Persona section of the new <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderCompanion\"\
  >Pathfinder Companion</a> line, a section which details a new, fully statted personality\
  \ from Golarion. Check out Lil's side of the Vancaskerkin tragedy, the entire \"\
  Second Darkness Player's Guide,\" and tons of new info for characters and GMs of\
  \ all stripes in <a href=\"/pathfinder/v5748btpy81x7\">Pathfinder Companion: Second\
  \ Darkness</a> next month!</p> \n   <p>F. Wesley Schneider<br> <i>Pathfinder</i>\
