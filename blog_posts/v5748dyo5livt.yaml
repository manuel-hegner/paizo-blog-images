  > \n     <p>In this final preview of <a href=\"/products/btpy9ipr\"><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Campaign Setting: Path of the Hellknight</em></a>, I figured I'd touch on the\
  \ Hellknight arsenal—rules-wise the book's meatiest chapter—and wrap things up with\
  \ glimpses of the remaining three major Hellknight orders. So let's dive right in!</p>\
  \ \n     <h2>Hellknight Arsenal</h2> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">The most\
  \ rules dense section of Path of the Hellknight comes at the very end. While there's\
  \ certainly plenty of content in here for GMs planning to pit their PCs against\
  \ Hellknight foes, in truth, this section is designed to give players a ton of new\
  \ options for their Hellknight characters. A host of new traits, feats, spells,\
  \ and equipment provide a spectrum of new ways to make your character feel more\
  \ like a driven and entrenched Hellknight, while details on existing cavalier orders\
  \ and inquisitor inquisitions recast existing options to further the Hellknights'\
  \ agendas. You'll also find new options for those taking the Hellknight prestige\
  \ class, the Order of the Ennead Star cavalier order, and more. There is a ton of\
  \ super cool content in this chapter worth showing off...</p> \n     <p>So, moving\
  \ right along to our final three major Hellknight orders!</p> \n     <blockquote>\

  \ \n      <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Members</b> atheists, former cultists, members\

  \ \n      <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Favored Weapon</b> glaive</p> \n      <p\
  \ class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Reckoning</b> Burn yourself over an open flame. Once\

  \ This does not stack with resist energy or any other abilities that provide fire\
  \ resistance and overlaps with protection from energy.</p> \n     </blockquote>\
  \ \n     <p>Whether unhealthy beliefs take root in the minds of religious fanatics,\
  \ practitioners of strange mystical arts, or students of radical philosophies, the\
  \ Order of the Pyre strives to stamp out all outlandish convictions. This philosophy\
  \ has given these Hellknights a well-earned reputation as cultist hunters who are\
  \ intolerant of religion. Yet the Order of the Pyre also seeks to thwart philosophical\
  \ revolutions and the insidious spread of dangerous ways of thinking. The order\
  \ uses the faiths and mores of Chelish society as the standard of acceptable beliefs.\
  \ The Inner Sea region's most common deities are acceptable to them, as are orderly\
  \ philosophies such as diabolism and the Prophecies of Kalistrade. However, the\
  \ order views whatever doesn't mesh with Chelish thinking or doesn't have an existing\
  \ role within society as dangerous.</p> \n     <p>Followers of the Pyre can expect\
  \ to learn more about the group's witch-hunting methods, their costal citadel and\
  \ black armored fleet of ships, and a variety of feats and magic items perfect for\
  \ hunting down practitioners of dark faiths an traditions.</p>\n     <p> </p>\n\

  \ \n     <p>The Order of the Rack numbers among the Hellknight orders that the public\
  \ most loathes. The order has a reputation for raiding the homes of those who speak\
  \ out against the status quo, and for breaking up groups of malcontents before they\
  \ become guilds, unions, or revolutionaries. They are the enemies of foreign ideals\
  \ and innovations, not because they lack merit, but because they detract from what\
  \ these Hellknights perceive to be the traditional values of southern Avistan. Art\
  \ and technology are viewed as wasteful or dangerous, especially when they meet\
  \ in union. None can say how many valuable printing presses Hellknights of the Rack\
  \ have destroyed, or how many thousands of pages of unique stories, songs, and philosophies\
  \ they have burned in the shadow of Citadel Rivad. All of this is summarized in\
  \ the Order of the Rack's symbol, the torturer's wheel, which the order sees as\
  \ the embodiment of wayward thinking and the suffering manifested by those permitted\
  \ to indulge their ideas.</p> \n     <p>Those seeking to join the Order of the Rack\
  \ can expect to learn more about this groups strict hierarchy, their hazing traditions,\
  \ technologies and texts targeted for destruction, the Hellknight's first citadel,\
  \ dozens of character options, a new poison, and a variety of crippling feats. Developments\
  \ within the order also see the rise of a new commander, Lictor Darcyne Wrens, and\
  \ the full story associated with that power shift.</p> \n     <blockquote> \n  \

  \ in any form. Its members hunt for political manipulation and abuses of power,\
  \ but their efforts also include an endless war against organized crime. At the\
  \ fringes of its influence, the Order of the Scourge might hunt gangs of burglars\
  \ or cutpurses, but in the heart of Cheliax these Hellknights crusade against faceless\
  \ guilds of thieves, sprawling criminal organizations, and nobles for whom crime\
  \ has become a family business. This regularly pits the Order of the Scourge against\
  \ some of the most dangerous powers in Cheliax, including members of the nation's\
  \ government.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderCampaignSetting/PZO9293-Test.jpg\"\
