  \ stepped up to the call for support! For the past few weeks, as the Friendly, Local,\
  \ Game Stores shuttered due to government mandates, the online venture-officers\
  \ helped their physical region counterparts move games, and entire conventions,\
  \ online. The online VOs ran training sessions, compiled resources, and answered\
  \ questions. They are the experts, and as such, I asked them to guest author today’\
  s blogs. Due to the length, we split their responses into two. This blog focuses\
  \ on play-by-post (PbP) benefits and experiences, as well as ways play Pathfinder\
  \ Adventure Card Game online. Tomorrow’s blog focuses on virtual tabletops (VTTs)\
  \ and general links and resources. If you missed Payton’s blog about <a href=\"\

  \ <b>Jesse Davis (IronHelixx)</b>, Regional Venture-Coordinator, Online Region:</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Watching the virtual gaming space adapt, evolve, and grow over the last\
  \ thirty+ years has been an interesting and exciting experience. It's grown from\
  \ simple, kludgy, rudimentary tools to realistic 2-D, and even 3-D, tabletop experiences\
  \ rivaling its analog progenitors, and even exceeding them in certain aspects. The\
  \ virtual tabletop has allowed friends and family spread wide-and-far to continue,\
  \ or even begin, their campaigns that otherwise would never have happened; its allowed\
  \ people from all over the world to “sit” at virtual-tables together in ways impossible\
  \ in the past; allowed those with no access to game-spaces to play when they would\
  \ otherwise be without; and extended opportunities for those unable to attend conventions\
  \ to finally take part in such events from the comfy confines of their own homes.\
  \ Watching the org-play opportunities explode online over the last decade has been\
  \ even more exciting to watch. The online world is now a vibrant 24/7, 365 community\
  \ filled with gaming opportunities, for every system and style of play that you\
  \ can imagine. We look forward to where it goes from here - and look forward to\
  \ you joining us and becoming part of the virtual gaming community we love so much.</p>\
  \ \n     <h3>Play-by-Post</h3> \n     <p>One of the best kept secrets Pathfinder\
  \ is the Online Community. Not every community or individual has an established\
  \ group of players or Lodge within a reasonable distance of them. This is what led\
  \ me in search of online Pathfinder games several years ago. I came across Play-by-Post\
  \ on the Paizo website and a very helpful and fun community. With games more than\
  \ 2+ hours away from my home I was able to easily find games within the online Play-by-Post\
  \ community. While they may take a bit longer (One post a day) than a traditional\
  \ face to face game I can put more effort into the actual roleplaying aspect which\
  \ helps enrich the purpose of our games. At first it might seem a bit overwhelming,\
  \ but it is incredibly easy, and we have a great and wonderful community that will\
  \ help guide you each step of the way. Come and join us for a game during these\
  \ trying times. Locations can be found below:</p> \n     <hr width=\"50%\"> \n \

  \ Larsen (Tyranius)</b>, venture-captain PbP</p> \n     <p>Play-by-post gaming was\
  \ the one thing that kept me playing Pathfinder and roleplaying games in general.\
  \ It started about 15 years ago when I moved away from the metro Boston area. I\
  \ left a land of plenty when it came to game stores and places to engage in my favorite\
  \ hobby to a place where few opportunities existed. So, I started getting into virtual\
  \ tabletop games to satisfy my need to play. Then I started to have a family, one\
  \ child then two, the third and fourth followed. Now with a full family and more\
  \ responsibilities in my career, the time to set aside four or five hours at a time\
  \ was no longer there. Play-by-post gaming which I had dabbled in before seemed\
  \ like the natural solution. I found the Pathfinder Society group on Myth Weavers\
  \ and jumped right in. Played a few games to get my feet wet, then tried my hand\
  \ at GMing when I was ready. Fast forward a few years and our first VA had to leave\
  \ his post and that when I was picked to step into the VO corps. While I play and\
  \ GM on Paizo as well, my focus is on the smaller lodges. There may not always be\
  \ a game mustering when you get there but stop in some time at <a href=\"https://rpggeek.com/guild/1329\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">RPG Geek</a> or <a href=\"https://www.myth-weavers.com/forumdisplay.php?f=19749\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Myth weavers</a> and say hello. Tell us what you are interested\
  \ in playing and maybe someone will be happy to help you find a game. We’ll certainly\
  \ be willing to show you the ropes. Figuring out the post formats may take some\
  \ getting used to, but we'll guide you along until you get used to it.<br><b>— Michael\
  \ Hallet</b>, venture-lieutenant PbP</p> \n     <p>If a face-to-face roleplaying\
  \ session is like exploring the set of a big-budget movie, a Play-by-Post or PbP\
  \ game is akin to living inside the pages of a great book. PbP evokes the literary\
  \ roots of fantasy gaming. And just as you are unlikely to digest an entire book\
  \ in one sitting, you can play a PbP game as much, or as little, as you like throughout\
  \ the day and weeks. The text format and slower pacing allow time to experience\
  \ vivid, detailed descriptions, deep, internal monologues, and shrewd, sharp-witted\
  \ negotiations. When I play via PbP, my bards' songs are more lyrical, my androids’\
  \ computations are more analytical, my clerics are more prayerful, and my gnomes\
  \ are more playful. My insightful envoy can readily pick up on the thoughts in the\
  \ room. My crazed, mad witch usually has a song running through her head. My incompetent\
  \ witchwyrd spy always finds his well-planned schemes becoming thwarted by his more\
  \ savvy, fellow party members. My pompous, scholarly wizard spouts out facts with\
  \ Wikipedia-like knowledge. And whenever someone speaks to her, my wise-cracking\
  \ ysoki always-- always-- has the perfect, instant comeback. Indeed, if one didn't\
  \ know any better, they'd almost think that she'd taken several hours, perhaps even\
  \ days, to come up with it.<br><b>— Lysle Kapp</b>venture-agent PbP</p>\n     <p></p>\
  \ \n     <p>I first became involved in RPGs several decades ago though I did not\
  \ have my first Organized Play experience until August 2017. I had a great local\
  \ community to play with and within a year I had GMed my first game, attended my\
  \ first PaizoCon, and discovered Play-by-Post (PbP). The online community was just\
  \ as welcoming and supportive, and I discovered PbP provides the ideal environment\
  \ to improve my roleplaying and GMing skills. It also provides an opportunity to\
  \ play with others in very many areas of the world and without needing to commit\
  \ a significant single block of time or share a time zone. I have since begun to\
  \ enjoy the different benefits of online VTT (virtual table top) play, also with\
  \ an international group of players. I am happy and honored to be a part of the\
  \ team that helps provide structure for our Online Organized Play community.<br><b>—\
  \ Katrina Hennessy</b>, venture-agent PbP</p> \n     <p>Though I didn’t participate\
  \ in my first Play-by-Post under the Organized Play umbrella until 2015 I’d discovered\
  \ the format nearly a year and a half earlier by random chance and pretty quickly\
  \ fell in love. Some of my fellow Venture Officers have already laid out many of\
  \ the wonderful advantages to be found by playing online such as flexibility, convenience,\
  \ and expanded opportunities for roleplay. Yet the one that has been the most meaningful\
  \ in a personal sense is that Play-by-Post has allowed me to find my own voice and\
  \ tap into a sense of creativity that I never knew I had, all through the power\
  \ of writing and cooperative storytelling. It allows me to be the things I want\
  \ to be and express myself in a way that I’ve always had a difficult time doing\
  \ at face-to-face tables. The feeling this gives me is something that I wouldn’\
  t trade for the world - and it’s a feeling that I’d love to share with others. So,\
  \ if Play-by-Post sounds appealing to you, please drop in at any of the lodges and\
  \ say hello! We’d love to meet you and help you get started.<br><b>— Kristin Wilhite</b>,\
  \ venture-agent PbP</p> \n     <h3>Pathfinder Adventure Card Game</h3> \n     <p>While\
  \ our colleagues over in the roleplaying game space have many options for where\
  \ and how to run their games, the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game is understandably\
  \ more constrained… after all, PACG cards don’t fall under the Open Gaming License.\
  \ Despite this, Paizo has been more than willing to work with those of us who don’\
  t have the time or opportunity to meet in face-to-face space to play this game that\
  \ many of us are very passionate about. Over the past year or so the online PACG\
  \ community has been consistently growing. To handle that growth an online system,\
  \ which can be found at <a href=\"https://acg.orgplayonline.com/accounts/login/\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">acg.orgplayonline.org</a>, has been created to allow for games\
  \ to be played through play-by-post on the Paizo forums. This system is still in\
  \ its relative infancy, but it allows games to be run by a “box runner” (or BR),\
  \ with that BR posting updates to the forums and players posting their actions and\
  \ a summary of their current hand. You can see an example of one of these games,\
  \ where BR AAUGHWHY has been running myself and others through all 6 adventures\
  \ of the Season of Tapestry Tide <a href=\"https://paizo.com/campaigns/v5748p75ivkh3/gameplay\"\
  >here</a>.</p> \n     <p>For more info on how this all works, check out the <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkot?A-New-Way-to-Play-the-Pathfinder-Adventure\"\
  >second half of this blog post</a> which gives a high-level overview. If you’re\
  \ interested in trying out one of these games, I recommend checking out the <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/campaigns/PFSACGFlaxseedOnDeckAdventureCardGuildLodge\">Flaxseed\
  \ On Deck Lodge</a>. There we have instructions on how to get involved as well as\
  \ other resources that can help you get started with building your character deck\
  \ to play online.</p> \n     <p>In addition to our play-by-post system, we’ve been\
  \ authorized for the time being to allow for other methods of play. Some of our\
  \ player base has had luck with running games using web cameras, with players using\
  \ the <a href=\"https://pacg.fandom.com/wiki/Pathfinder_Adventure_Card_Game_Wiki\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">PACG Wiki</a> to reference cards they acquire and may not have\
  \ physical copies of. We’re also looking into additional options, so please feel\
  \ free to post in the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/campaigns/PFSACGFlaxseedOnDeckAdventureCardGuildLodge/discussion&amp;page=last\"\
  >Flaxseed On Deck Lodge discussion thread</a> if you’d like to propose or ask about\
  \ other options.</p> \n     <p>We very much look forward to having you join us in\
  \ playing PACG online!<br><b>—Tyler Beck</b>, venture-captain online ACG</p> \n\
  \     <p>I got involved in Play-by-Post for Pathfinder Adventure Card Game a few\
  \ years ago because my schedule does not always allow me to take large blocks of\
  \ time to play with my local group. That makes it difficult for me to attend regularly\
  \ and complete a campaign with them. What I like about play-by-post is that it can\
  \ be done anywhere, and it takes less time out of my day spread out over a week\
  \ rather than all in one afternoon. Basically, it's been a convenient way to get\
  \ a little dose of ACG on a regular basis without straining my schedule. Another\
  \ part of the online play-by-post I have enjoyed is that it allows players to connect\
  \ from all over the world. </p> \n     <p>Something somewhat unique to play-by-post\
  \ for the card game is that some players choose to roleplay their turns. This is\
  \ not required by any means but is sometimes a nice way to add flavor to turns that\
  \ I have never seen at a face-to-face card game session. Here’s an example from\
  \ <a href=\"http://paizo.com/campaigns/ACGCaGSeasonOfTheRighteousByRedeux/gameplay&amp;page=26#1259\"\
  >Amaryllis meeting a Treachery Demon</a>, or <a href=\"https://paizo.com/campaigns/v5748p75ivkfi/gameplay&amp;page=5#239\"\
  >Lem fighting a Cultist</a>.</p> \n     <p>We have many helpful players so don’\
  t be afraid to check out the resources Tyler provided and ask questions as needed.\
  \ We were all new to the online format and/or card game at one point or another!<br><b>—\
