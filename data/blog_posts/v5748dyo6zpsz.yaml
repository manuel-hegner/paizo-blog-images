  \ Ahn (they/them)</h3>\n      <p>안녕, 여러분! I’m going to take this chance to celebrate\
  \ my mother. While not a leader in any professionally acknowledged way, she’s always\
  \ encouraged me to approach life unflinchingly and fight for what I stand for. My\
  \ mother has professionally translated accounts of Korean comfort women, teaches\
  \ immigrants how to speak English, and, in her youth, was one of many students fighting\
  \ for the democratization of South Korea. Even now, she’s working on a Ph.D. in\
  \ linguistics (her second, if you want to know the shoes I’m expected to fill) on\
  \ the development of DEI language over the past ten years— and she’s told me if\
  \ the administration attempts to clothesline her work anymore than it has already,\
  \ she’ll drop the degree immediately.&nbsp;</p>\n      <p>I like to joke that, unlike\
  \ other Korean American kids, I don’t have a mom who wants me to be a doctor or\
  \ a lawyer. Instead, I have one who pushed me to understand the weight my words\
  \ carry and who even now encourages me to focus on writing— which is why I get to\
  \ write for this blog post to begin with! Thanks, 엄마. I’m doing my best to make\
  \ you proud.</p>\n      <br>\n      <h3>Hiromi Cota (they/she)</h3>\n      <p>This\
  \ year for AANHPI Month, I have a pair of things I’d like to highlight, and one’\
  s not even a game! I recently celebrated my peoples’ (Okinawan &amp; Yaeyaman) parallel\
  \ cultures by getting tattoos! In the Ryukyuan cultures, women get hand tattoos\
  \ to mark milestones towards adulthood, and men get forearm tattoos. As a non-binary\
  \ &amp; femme person, I got my right hand tattooed with a mix of Okinawan and Yaeyaman\
  \ styles to celebrate both parts of my Indigenous Islander heritage.</p>\n     \
  \ <p>The other thing I want to highlight is Tian Xia+, a third-party expansion to\
  \ the Tian Xia World &amp; Character Guides by Team+. Most of the people working\
  \ on the book were people of Asian descent—some of the same folks who worked on\
  \ the official Tian Xia books, in fact. I gave the sai some love, as it’s a traditional\
  \ Okinawan weapon that’s near and dear to my heart. You can find this sai goodness\
  \ under the Three-Finger Fist archetype. I also worked on the Minatan Warrior archetype,\
  \ which was heavily based on Filipino Martial Arts, and the expansion of the Tsukumogami\
  \ Poppets, because I love those little guys, too!</p>\n      <p>Happy AANHPI Month!</p>\n\

  \ death</p>\n      <p>Hi everyone! I'm Matthew, a Chinese American chemist by day\
  \ and freelance writer and GM by night. I don't have anything else to promote since\
  \ the release of NPC Core, but I wanted to take a moment to celebrate and reflect\
  \ on the lessons that my Po Po (grandmother) instilled upon me. She recently passed,\
  \ and I have her to thank for who am I as a person. She was generous, kind, and\
  \ patient, and she showed her love through example, always putting her family before\
  \ herself.</p>\n      <p>I've always struggled with coming to terms with my heritage,\
  \ but she always presented Chinese culture in a welcoming and inclusive manner,\
  \ never pressuring me to accept it if I didn't want to. It's something that I am\
  \ still at odds with even to this day, but I am eternally grateful for her exposing\
  \ me to many wonderful customs that I might have disregarded elsewise. Regardless\
  \ of what I make of it, I can rest easy knowing that her love will always stay with\
  \ me.</p>\n      <p>Thank you for letting me share my story.</p>\n      <br>\n \

  \ in Hawai'i and the Philippines and later sailed the seven seas as I started my\
  \ career.</p>\n      <p>Over the past 5 years, I have written 20 freelance TTRPG\
  \ projects, including several scheduled for release later this year! I’ve worked\
  \ mostly for Paizo, but also for Legendary Games, Evil Genius Games, and Evil Robot\
  \ Games. I produce two podcasts on the Know Direction Network: <a href=\"https://knowdirectionpodcast.com/category/podcasts/digital-divination/\"\

  \ Ron Lundeen, and <a href=\"https://knowdirectionpodcast.com/category/podcasts/intrepid-heroes/\"\

  \ (currently <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq047uk?Starfinder-Second-Edition-Playtest-Adventure-A-Cosmic-Birthday\"\
  >A Cosmic Birthday</a>). Previously, I produced <a href=\"https://knowdirectionpodcast.com/category/podcasts/presenting/\"\
  >Presenting - Gamers Making Games</a>, where I interviewed over 100 game designers,\
  \ developers, artists, and editors about their journey into the industry. I’m presenting\
  \ a summary of these interviews at <a href=\"https://www.gencon.com/events/272066\"\
  >Gen Con</a> this year. In my non-gaming life, I do university research and teaching\

  \ the joy and excitement I felt upon realizing that Yoon had a Korean name, and\
  \ that her heritage was, in fact, my own. Being Korean as a kid was frustrating—\
  I’d always be asked if I was Chinese and where Korea was, anyway. (The 90s were\
  \ tough.) But things have changed. K-pop, Korean dramas, and barbecue have shaken\
  \ things up, and I hope to do the same with RPGs. Not just for myself, but for everyone\
  \ who’s felt a little on the wayside. All my love to everyone who’s had to explain\
  \ where their country is or answer ignorant questions about their heritage. You\
  \ matter, and we’re with you.</p>\n      <br>\n      <center>\n       <hr width=\"\
