  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Sunday, December 22, 2013</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"\
  > \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">The relatively new Campaign Cards sets\
  \ from the <i>Pathfinder Cards</i> line include quest cards, which tie directly\
  \ into the corresponding adventure. So far we've seen <a href=\"/products/btpy929b\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Cards: The Dragon's Demand Campaign Cards</i></a>, which tied in\
  \ to <a href=\"/products/btpy8yvy\"><i>Pathfinder Module: The Dragon's Demand</i></a>,\
  \ and <a href=\"/products/btpy8xsl\"><i>Pathfinder Cards: Wardens of the Reborn\
  \ Forge Campaign Cards</i></a> to complement <a href=\"/products/btpy92lr\"><i>Wardens\
  \ of the Reborn Forge</i></a>. We're also going to have sets for the upcoming RPG\
  \ Superstar module <a href=\"/products/btpy8xss\"><i>Tears at Bitter Manor</i></a>,\
  \ and the hardcovers super dungeon <i>The Emerald Spire</i>!</span></p> \n    <p>But\
  \ if you haven't used the Campaign Cards before, you might be unfamiliar with how\
  \ the quests and quest cards work. Well, the quests are built to provide more XP\
  \ to PCs and give them clear goals they can choose to pursue (or not), and they\
  \ appear in several places in the text.</p> \n    <p>First off, each module has\
  \ a list of quests at the start of the book. Let's take a look at an example from\
  \ Wardens of the Reborn Forge! I've trimmed out some of the text so you won't get\
  \ spoiled on the adventure's plot, but rest assure the quest list contains all the\
  \ salient details for the GM.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><b>3. Sabotage!</b>:\
  \ Acquired: Adventure's start. Quest: Uncover [REDACTED]'s role in sabotaging the\
  \ Brass Guardians in areas [REDACTED]. Reward: 51,200 XP.</p> \n    </blockquote>\
  \ \n    <p>This entry shows when the PCs acquire the quest in the adventure, what\
  \ they need to do to complete it, and the reward they earn. Often, this reward includes\
  \ items or gold in addition to an XP story award. The \"acquired\" entry also shows\
  \ when the PCs get the corresponding quest card from the Campaign Cards set. Of\
  \ course, you can have them write it down or make your own cards, but the cards\
  \ are probably going to look a little cooler than your index card.</p> \n    <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderCards/PZO3034_WardensCards_500.jpeg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderCards/PZO3034_WardensCards_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n     <br>Illustration by Matthew Starbuck\n    </div> \n    <p>The players\
  \ hold on to this card, which conveniently summarizes the quest's requirements—\
  without spoilers—until they complete it. Each card is fully illustrated and has\
  \ a summary, but includes none of the reward information the GM knows (though some\
  \ quests involve an NPC revealing the amount of the reward up front and that sort\
  \ of thing). The back has plenty of space for taking notes, with a wider note box\
  \ than you'd see on an item or face card.</p> \n    <p>The final part of the quest\
  \ is the story award for completing it. This appears in the section where the PCs\
  \ get the information they're looking for, defeat the enemy they've been tasked\
  \ with taking down, or the like. For instance, here's one tied to the quest above.\
  \ The text appears in the adventure location that's cut out of the quest text above.</p>\
  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><b>Story Award</b>: If the PCs uncover [REDACTED]'s\
  \ role in the reprogramming of Alkenstar's Brass Guardians, award them 51,200 XP.</p>\
  \ \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>And that wraps up the quest! The selection of quests\
  \ can include both long-reaching quests that take pretty much the entire adventure\
  \ to complete, or ones that can be acquired and completed within the span of one\
  \ session. Hope you enjoyed this rundown of how these cards work, and may you complete\
  \ all your quests!</p> \n    <p>Logan Bonner<br \\> <i>Developer</i></p> \n   </div>\
