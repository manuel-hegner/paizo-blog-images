  \ Farabellus strides into the common room, looks around at the handful of agents\
  \ lounging on the benches, then points his finger at several individuals in quick\
  \ succession. “Belker, Nepsin, Hoger, Klar, Tennit, Greensward.” Grab your kits\
  \ and head to Valsin’s office. He’s got a task for you over at the Blakros Museum.\
  \ Farabellus gives them a friendly smile and nods, then turns sharply on his heel\
  \ and leaves the room, ignoring the uproar his announcement generates.</p> \n  \
  \    <p>The six quickly stand and gather their gear, chattering over each other\
  \ in tense excitement.</p> \n      <p>“Abadar save us, not the Blakros Museum again!”\
  \ exclaims Nathaniel Tennit. Wonder what it is this time?”</p> \n      <p>“Did you\
  \ hear about the monkey infestation a few years back?” asks Asha Belkar. “Or the\
  \ haunts around the mysterious orrery in the attics?”</p> \n      <p>“Well you know\
  \ they traffic in all sorts of unsavory practices. Like sacrificing their own daughters\
  \ to extraplanar beings,” Zander Hoger makes a grimace of disgust. “Makes one want\
  \ to burn the place down.”</p> \n      <p>“You wouldn’t be the first one to try,\
  \ Xander,” Murphis Klar replies. “Both Medda and Tavvar Hamavsi let eldritch energies\
  \ loose that could have destroyed the entire structure, or worse, the entire Wise\
  \ Quarter. We don’t need to give the Peacebuilders any more ammunition against the\
  \ Society.” Murphis slams their fist on the table in emphasis.</p> \n      <p>“\
  Well, you know Nigel was an agent years ago. I heard he had some sort of mutual\
  \ assistance agreement with a prior venture-captain, maybe even the Decemvirate.\
  \ Important enough to send agents to one of Hestia Blakros’ daughters’ wedding.\
  \ Sema Greensward sighs. “Now that’s a mission I’d enjoy going on. Think of the\
  \ food!”</p> \n      <p>Quenila Nepsin shoulders her pack. “Personally, I’d prefer\
  \ to be up at Iceferry Lodge right now--I hear Venture-Captain Torrsen and some\
  \ Frostfurs found a pass into Irrisen, and I’d take the icy frontier over the museum\
  \ any day. But we better go! Valsin doesn’t appreciate lollygaggers. If we don’\
  t get to his office pronto, he may just assign us sewer duty.”</p> \n      <p>Groaning\
  \ at the thought of delving into the subterranean depths of Absalom’s sewers, the\
  \ group grabs their gear and leaves the room. The remaining agents look at each\
  \ other, relief at not being chosen the foremost emotion in the room.</p> \n   \
  \   <p>“Guess no one told them about the break-in at the museum a few weeks ago,”\
  \ mutters one of the agents left behind.</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <div class=\"\

  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario 2-07: The Blakros Deception</em></a>, a level 5–\
  8 adventure by Charlie Brooks. The storied Blakros Museum has seen more than its\
  \ fair share of misfortune over the years, and this scenario will give players a\
  \ chance to investigate the institution for themselves. Meanwhile, it’s starting\
  \ to get cold here in the Seattle area, but certainly not as chilly as in Irrisen,\
  \ where Mikhail Rekun takes us for <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq0251r?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-208-A-Frosty-Mug\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario 2-08: A Frosty Mug</em></a>. This level 5–8 adventure\
  \ sees the PCs making their way into the Land of Eternal Winter, with directions\
  \ to chart the pass and the lands beyond, encountering winter, magic, and inhabitants\
  \ from a strange, faraway world. </p> \n     <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight:\
