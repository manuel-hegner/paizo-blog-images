  \ \n     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Greetings, players! With\
  \ the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq029wb\"><em>Book of the Dead</em></a>\
  \ release coming next week, we wanted to take a moment to talk about sanctioning\
  \ content. The rulebook resulted in a fair amount of discussion internally, and\
  \ we thought it was a good idea to take a step back and look at how our sanctioning\
  \ works.</p> \n      <h2>Why We Sanction Content</h2> \n      <p>Regularly, the\
  \ OP team is asked (directly or indirectly) why we sanction content. After all,\
  \ other campaigns just let people play whatever they want whenever they want, so\
  \ why don’t we? While that would be a lot less work, it’s important to us that the\
  \ campaign remains as balanced and fair as possible. One of the hallmarks of Paizo\
  \ Organized Play is that no matter what table you’re playing at worldwide, the players\
  \ at the table are all playing with the same general rules and power level.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>To that end, there are three main reasons why we might ban or restrict\
  \ an option in the campaign these days:</p> \n      <ol> \n       <li><b>It’s evil</b>.\
  \ Evil options are banned by default in the campaign, so any evil deities are right\
  \ out. This extends to options that have evil or unsavory flavor to them; in Book\
  \ of the Dead, for example, there’s a familiar that’s made with the blood of a murder\
  \ victim. That’s a little beyond the pale for us, so it’s not likely to be allowed.</li>\
  \ \n       <li><b>It’s unbalanced</b>. This one is pretty rare in Pathfinder Society\
  \ these days and is much more likely to come up in Starfinder Society. Still, occasionally\
  \ options sneak through that skew the power balance and require us to bring down\
  \ the metaphorical banhammer.</li> \n       <li><b>There’s too much GM adjudication</b>.\
  \ These sorts of options are great for home campaigns where you can work with your\
  \ GM to either determine their ruling for an unclear rule, or set up a legendary\
  \ quest to obtain your one-of-a-kind soulforged armor. However, in a global campaign\
  \ where the Organized Play staff is the GM, some of these options require too much\
  \ adjudication to ensure a uniform table experience.</li> \n      </ol> \n     \
  \ <p>There are other reasons why an option might be removed, of course, but these\
  \ are the three major ones. To that end, let’s talk about <em>Book of the Dead</em>.</p>\
  \ \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/29ae4d63-fcbf-4d12-9158-afc19dda8c4b/PZO2110_OrdelliaWhilwren.jpg\"\

  \      </div> \n      <br> \n      <h2>Book of the Dead</h2> \n      <p>Let’s start\
  \ with the bad news: the playable undead options won’t be available in the campaign\
  \ when the book is released next week. We discussed them extensively during our\
  \ sanctioning review, and ultimately we decided that, for now, they aren’t going\
  \ to be accessible. This is due to a combo of some of the reasons we discussed above:\
  \ there are balance concerns with some of them, but all of them come with a little\
  \ bit more evil than we’re comfortable with. </p> \n      <p>Consider the zombie\
  \ archetype, which requires a zombie to consume the brain of one sentient creature\
  \ per day. This has a little too much potential to disrupt scenarios in our view;\
  \ we certainly don’t want to incentivize players to attack otherwise friendly NPCs\
  \ just to get their daily serving of brains, and not all players will be comfortable\
  \ with the idea of a fellow PC chowing down on a recently-defeated enemy spellcaster.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Despite the existence of playable undead options, the design team has\
  \ confirmed that undead are still pretty uniformly evil, and universally still abhorrent\
  \ to the natural cycle of life in Golarion. Certainly there are options for PCs\
  \ that are both undead and neutral, but with this guidance from the design team,\
  \ we felt it was best to keep the undead in the ground for the moment. All that\
  \ being said, we’ve got a plan to integrate the skeleton ancestry early in PFS Year\
  \ 4, so start saving your Achievement Points and stay tuned for that information.\
  \ It’s also possible that some of the less-problematic undead archetypes might see\
  \ play as the result of actions in a scenario, or as a charity boon sent out to\
  \ conventions.</p> \n      <p>As a point of good news, we’ll be sanctioning the\
  \ adventure contained within the book, “March of the Dead,” for Pathfinder Society\
  \ credit in adventure mode! We’re trying something a little new with this one; we\
  \ felt the adventure was longer than one session of play, but shorter than a full\
  \ adventure, so this adventure will provide credit for two sessions worth of XP,\
  \ treasure and Reputation. The chronicle can be applied to any of your Pathfinder\
  \ Society characters. Let us know how it goes and if this level of credit is useful\
  \ or if it just causes you problems.</p> \n      <h2>Closing Reminders &amp; Updates</h2>\
  \ \n      <p>During our discussions on the undead-related options as a whole, a\
  \ couple of recurring topics came up that we wanted to remind players of or clarify.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>First of all, evil characters are prohibited in the campaign. This\
  \ extends beyond alignment; your characters should be willing and capable of working\
  \ together with a group to complete your mission. Your characters should not disrupt\
  \ play by randomly attacking other characters or NPCs, performing evil actions,\
  \ or otherwise causing chaos unless such chaos is both warranted within the scenario\
  \ and enjoyed by all at the table, including the GM. As options with eviler flavor\
  \ come into the campaign, such as undead companions and eidolons, players should\
  \ maintain the same level of respect and decorum. “But it’s what my character would\
  \ do!” is not justification for mayhem and disrespect.</p> \n      <p>Second of\
  \ all, a character <b>never</b> violates their anathema simply by joining a mission.\
  \ This has come up before with superstition instinct barbarians, but once again,\
  \ the undead threaten to disrupt this. Characters that follow Pharasma or other\
  \ deities that abhor undead are not obligated to immediately smite a skeleton PC\
  \ or a ghostly animal companion. The gods will not bring down righteous fury simply\
  \ because you were unlucky enough to sit at the wrong table. (Now, if you encounter\
  \ different skeletons in a tomb and don’t smite them, <em>then</em> Pharasma will\
  \ be very displeased.)</p> \n      <p>We hope you enjoy playing with the options\
  \ in <em>Book of the Dead</em> that are sanctioned when it’s released next week.\
  \ There are still plenty of legal options for those players who want to more effectively\
  \ fight against undead as well as those who want to give their characters a bit\
  \ more undead flavor. Until next time—Explore! Report! Cooperate! And don’t forget\
  \ to check under your bed!</p> \n      <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight:\
