  \     <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\"></p> \n     <p>Greetings Starfinders,</p> \n\
  \     <p itemprop=\"description\">Two weeks ago, we implemented tech that successfully\
  \ fixed a number of issues with the Achievements Points system. While there are\
  \ still some tweaks we’d like to make, the system is at a stage where we are ready\
  \ to introduce Achievement Points for Starfinder Society. We’ve got a few other\
  \ changes in the pipeline as well, so read on for a full explanation of what’s coming\
  \ for the Starfinder Society!</p> \n     <br clear=\"all\"> \n     <h3>New Guide\
  \ to Organized Play</h3> \n     <p>Approximately two weeks before PaizoCon Online,\
  \ we intend to release the new version of the Guide to Organized Play: Starfinder\
  \ Society. This will be a digital guide hosted on the OPF website, much like the\
  \ Pathfinder Society version. This will enable us to make changes and clarifications\
  \ more rapidly, as well as make it more searchable. At this point, there are no\
  \ major rules changes planned for Year 4, though we have several program changes\
  \ we’ve outlined below.</p> \n     <h3>Introduction of Starfinder AcP</h3> \n  \
  \   <p>Beginning <b>May 28, 2021</b>, all reported Starfinder games will earn Achievement\
  \ Points (Starfinder) for the boon store. These points will be earned at the same\
  \ rate as the Pathfinder Society: 4 points for players and 8 points for GMs in a\
  \ 4-hour scenario. These will also be granted the 1.25x multiplier at conventions\
  \ and locations under the Regional Support Program, and a 1.5x multiplier at Tier\
  \ 1 conventions and Paizo-sponsored/licensed events.</p> \n     <p>AcP (Starfinder)\
  \ will be used to purchase Starfinder boons in the online store, available on the\
  \ Boons tab of the My Organized Play page. We’ve started publishing boons that will\
  \ be ready at launch to give an idea of what will be available, and will continue\
  \ to add to this list until launch.</p> \n     <p>Achievement Points for Starfinder\
  \ Society will <b>not</b> be retroactive to the start of the campaign. If you played\
  \ prior to this date, you already earned Fame for those scenarios, as well as additional\
  \ boons for certain events. We will include an online version for each chronicle\
  \ boon going forward, though paper boons in circulation are valid for use. </p>\

  \ train\"></a>\n      <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\"></p>\n     </div> \n     <h3>Removal\
  \ of Fame for Starfinder Society</h3> \n     <p>With the introduction of Achievement\
  \ Points, we will be saying goodbye to the Fame system. Here are the important dates\
  \ for this process.</p> \n     <p><b>Today</b>: This information is posted. Nothing\
  \ changes; games played after today still earn Fame until May 28.<br> <b>May 28</b>:\
  \ Games played on or after this date do not earn Fame. GMs should not award Fame,\
  \ though players may still spend Fame on the boons listed in the Year 3 Guide.<br>\
  \ <b>November 4</b>: In our monthly update blog, we will share information on how\
  \ to convert any remaining unspent Fame to Starfinder Achievement Points.<br> <b>December\
  \ 31</b>: Any unspent and unconverted Fame is lost.</p> \n     <p>Any Fame boons\
  \ that are purchased between now and December 31 will function in perpetuity. We’\
  re not taking away anything that’s already been purchased, and you will be able\
  \ to use those boons as long as the SFS campaign exists.</p> \n     <h3>Why Are\
  \ You Doing This?</h3> \n     <p>There are several reasons for our switch to the\
  \ Achievement Points system, for both Pathfinder and Starfinder Society, and we\
  \ wanted to talk about a couple of them with you.</p> \n     <p>The first reason\
  \ is to encourage reporting of games. To be very frank: we rely a lot on the data\
  \ we get from the reporting system. We’ve used it to influence the story of our\
  \ living campaigns over the years, but lately, we’ve also been doing a fair amount\
  \ of analysis on what games the community is playing, as well as when and how you\
  \ all are playing them. We have found that the AcP (Pathfinder) system encourages\
  \ reporting, which ensures our data is as accurate and complete as it can be. This\
  \ ultimately lets us produce a better game, and it’s extremely important to Organized\
  \ Play.</p> \n     <p>The second reason is equality. In the past, there were many\
  \ boons that you could only get by going to a certain convention or event, which\
  \ is not possible for everyone. In a global campaign, we can’t ask our Australian\
  \ players to fly to Indianapolis just for the chance to play their favorite species.\
  \ Even closer to home, going to a major convention is a significant expense that\
  \ many can’t afford. The Achievement Points system lets everyone earn points at\
  \ the same rate and spend them on what they want most. It’s another step toward\
  \ being the most inclusive version of the Society that we can be.</p> \n     <h3>I\
  \ Have Questions/Comments/Concerns!</h3> \n     <p>Great! That’s what this post\
  \ is for.</p> \n     <p>The comments section below is open. Please treat this as\
  \ an open thread for questions, because we’ll be reading and answering as many as\
  \ we can. Remember the forum rules as you do so: be respectful and civil in your\
  \ questions, and understand that while elements of the plan may change, there’s\
  \ no argument that is going to make us totally change course. Any answers we give\
  \ will be folded into either the Guide for Year 4 or the Starfinder Society FAQ\
  \ page as appropriate, so you’re not having to cite random forum comments for clarifications.</p>\
