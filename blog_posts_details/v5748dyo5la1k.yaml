  artist: "a undaunted band of brothers. A band that cannot be daunted by the mightiest\
    \ of daunters. I speak, perforce, of the strapping young men of Pathfinder. They\
    \ are coming for you.\" I sought an exit, but these are Pathfinders, you see.\
    \ They can find anyone, and since I am anyone, they found me. From me they demanded\
    \ a boon: a tarot deck they could call their very own. Messrs. James and James\
    \ and Jason and F. Wesley believed that the world thirsted for such a deck. I\
    \ was the humble peddler of games that could slake this thirst. \"Sa-ha!\" I vocalized\
    \ to all who would hear, \"I shall call this deck 'Harrow,' as it speaks of travels\
    \ through the inferno, and it rhymes with 'Tarot.' And I shall not be alone in\
    \ this undertaking! If I am to walk this road, I will have a mighty illustrator\
    \ to illuminate my path.\" This depicter of souls would be Kyle Stanley Hunter,\
    \ he who could pluck"
