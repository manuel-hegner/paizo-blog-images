  \ <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lfzp\">You might have already heard about what\
  \ we have in store for the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game</a>, but that's far from\
  \ all. In the annual tradition of giving you an exciting new adventure to actually\
  \ play on Free RPG Day, this year's quest is <a href=\"/products/btpy959k\"><i>Pathfinder\
  \ Module: Risen from the Sands</i></a>, an expedition into the deep deserts of Osirion,\
  \ written by the director of the Mummy's Mask Adventure Path, Rob McCreary. This\
  \ foray into a perilous pyramid parallels the mysteries and ancient dangers of the\
  \ new Mummy's Mask Adventure Path<sup>*</sup>. Here's the gist:</span></p> \n  \
  \   <p>The deserts of Osirion—land of pharaohs and ancient tombs—hide not just untold\
  \ wonders, but also unspeakable dangers. When the vast sand dunes part to reveal\
  \ the ancient pyramid of the legendary Pharaoh of Sphinxes, glory seekers from across\
  \ many nations race toward it, each fighting to be the first to claim its wonders.\
  \ But the storied pharaoh doesn't rest quietly within this monument, and his tomb\
  \ was designed to slaughter any who would dare trespass.</p> \n     <p>A band of\
  \ bold adventurers are the first to arrive, and stand poised to claim what's risen\
  \ from the sands—but they're unaware of the doom that lurks inside. With daring\
  \ on their side and strange, rarely seen powers at their disposal, the heroes may\
  \ be the only force capable of containing the force of evil within and defeating\
  \ its curse!</p> \n     <p>But we're not just reaching into the forgotten past for\
  \ this year's offering, we're also looking toward the future. Toward August, in\
  \ particular, as Risen from the Sands includes four ready-to-play, pregenerated\
  \ characters previewing four classes from this Summer's major hardcover release,\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy95d1\"><i>Pathfinder RPG: Advanced Class Guide</i></a>.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Free RPG Day is Saturday June 21st, so be sure to check with your local\
  \ gaming store to make sure they'll be participating. It's less than 3 months away,\
  \ so mark your calendar and don't miss out on <a href=\"/products/btpy959k\"><i>Risen\
  \ from the Sands</i></a>, a new Pathfinder Adventure Card Game hero, and plenty\
  \ more Free RPG Day awesomeness!</p> \n     <p>F. Wesley Schneider<br \\> <i>Editor-in-Chief</i></p>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"tiny\"><sup>*</sup>No, they can't be goblin adventures every\
  \ year, or else you won't appreciate them. This year the Pathfinder Adventure Card\
  \ Game has your annual dash of goblin goodness.</p> \n    </div> \n   </blockquote>\
