  \ Do not worry! Everyone at Paizo is doing fine, and we appreciate everyone who\
  \ has sent us messages concerned about our health and safety. </p> \n     <p>In\
  \ place of Starfinder Wednesday and Pathfinder Friday, Payton will be live streaming\
  \ <i>Pathfinder: Kingmaker</i> on Paizo’s Twitch channel. So if you’ve ever wanted\

  \ Payton all that you know about Pathfinder, while having some fun conversation.</p>\

  \ this world by GM and occult enthusiast Jacob Kile, consists of:</p> \n     <ul>\
  \ \n      <li><b>Croog Claudel</b>, played by Croog: A human monk searching for\
  \ his long-lost siblings, hoping to make amends when he finds them.</li> \n    \
  \  <li><b>Moss the Magnificent</b>, played by Molly McIsaac: An Elven Sorcerer trying\
  \ to recapture the fame she had back home.</li> \n      <li><b>Robyn Way</b>, played\
  \ by Jonas Newhouse: A Gnome druid desperate to hide from her former life and family.\
  \ She’s married to Remi.</li> \n      <li><b>Remi Ashwillow</b>, played by William\
