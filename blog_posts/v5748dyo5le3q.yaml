  \ \n   <p>by Dave Gross</p> \n   <h2>Chapter Four: The Killing<br><i>Radovan</i></h2>\
  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p>It'd been over a year since I'd felt\
  \ the touch of a woman's hand, much less the rest of her. Iolanda, the most beautiful\
  \ prostitute in Absalom, had just offered me a whole night with her. All she wanted\
  \ in return was one little murder.</p> \n    <p>\"No dice, sweetheart.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">She looked me over again, her eyes lingering\
  \ on my arms, the spurs on my elbows, my fists, and all the fights carved into my\
  \ red leather jacket. \"I thought you might be the sort of man who had killed before.\"\
  </span></p> \n    <p>\"I'm trying to cut back.\"</p> \n    <p>She turned real slow,\
  \ her dark eyes stroking me. A bead of sweat slipped down my neck.</p> \n    <p>It'd\
  \ been over a year. I'd never gone a year.</p> \n    <p>\"What'd this guy do to\
  \ make you want him dead?\"</p> \n    <p>She sat down in front of a vanity and held\
  \ my brothel token near the lamp. I could just make out the naughty image on its\
  \ face. \"He took a purse full of tokens like this one.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Exactly\
  \ like that one?\"</p> \n    <p>\"No,\" she said. \"All different. He doles them\
  \ out as tips to common, ugly men, brutes and servants.\"</p> \n    <p>I tried not\
  \ to take it personal. There wasn't a thing I'd rather do than to go through that\
  \ purse and cash in every token, one by one. Still, it wasn't worth a man's life.\
  \ I said so.</p> \n    <p>\"He beat me,\" she said. \"In front of everyone.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Back in my Trick Alley days, I beat the hell out of the men who got too\
  \ rough. I broke a lot of arms and legs, cracked more than a couple of skulls, and\
  \ I was happy to do it. But the rule was, you don't take a life except for another\
  \ one.</p> \n    <p>And yeah, I knew some men need killing. Those cutthroats I'd\
  \ beaten earlier. It wasn't wrong to say I'd have done Absalom a big favor by ending\
  \ them.</p> \n    <p>But I hadn't. Sure, both in the Goatherds and later, working\
  \ for the boss, I'd had to do some killings, but it'd always been to keep the other\
  \ guy—or rat-man or demon—from killing me first. They all had it coming.</p> \n\
  \    <p>This last year, though, in the body of my own personal devil, I'd killed\
  \ plenty of guys who didn't have it coming. I thought about the monks of Iron Mountain\
  \ almost every day. I had nightmares about those phoenix girls.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  I can get those tokens back for you. I can even bust him up real bad. But I don't\
  \ kill him.\"</p> \n    <p>She turned to spill all that black, black hair over the\
  \ shoulder. \"For an hour of my attentions.\"</p> \n    <p>\"All night.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"You drive a hard bargain.\"</p> \n    <p>It had been a year. \"Sweetheart,\
  \ you got no idea.\"</p> \n    <p align=\"center\">∗∗∗</p> \n    <p>Iolanda pulled\
  \ a bell rope that summoned the thin white butler. She whispered in the servant's\
  \ ear, and she or he nodded, led me halfway downstairs, and pointed through an open\
  \ archway at a game of towers in the next room. There was my mark.</p> \n    <p>The\
  \ big fellow lounged back in his chair, drawing on a fat cigar as one of his two\
  \ toadies played his cards for him. Thick hair bristled on his bulging forearms,\
  \ and his beard was coming in after a morning's shave.</p> \n    <p>\"They will\
  \ leave soon,\" the servant whispered. \"They must be far away before any misfortune\
  \ falls on them.\"</p> \n    <p>I gave the servant the don't-tell-me-my-business\
  \ stare. She or he called over a hellspawn girl to keep me occupied, but I didn't\
  \ want to spoil my appetite. \"I'll just hang out.\"</p> \n    <p> The mark gave\
  \ up on towers a couple hours later. He tipped the dealer with one of those platinum\
  \ tokens. I couldn't see what favor was on its face, but from the dealer's eyes,\
  \ it was a good one. The mark and his lackeys pushed off. I gave them half a minute\
  \ and followed.</p> \n    <p>I saw the mark's goons walking away without him, a\
  \ carriage rolling off in the opposite direction. I recognized the shape of the\
  \ mark's head in the rear window.</p> \n    <p>Desna was smiling on me.</p> \n \
  \   <p>Before I could whistle, another carriage pulled up. The horses shied as they\
  \ got close to me, so I jumped into the cab. As they settled down, the driver who'd\
  \ dropped me off turned around with a grin. He'd been waiting for another good tip.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Follow that carriage,\" I told him. He slapped the reins.</p> \n  \
  \  <p>We followed the mark back toward the docks, where he got out beside a warehouse\
  \ office. His buddies were nowhere in sight, but he paused before putting a key\
  \ in the door. He looked right at the carriage. Right at me.</p> \n    <p>He pointed\
  \ at the docks and crooked a finger before walking over to the boardwalk.</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"Shall I drive on, sir?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Nah, this is good.\" I tossed\
  \ him the second-smallest of the purses I'd taken from the cutthroats. Before he\
  \ could ask, I said, \"Stick around. This won't take long.\"</p> \n    <p>I followed\
  \ the mark across the boardwalk. The place was almost deserted, with only a few\
  \ night watchmen swinging lanterns between the warehouses. My guy went up to one\
  \ of them and bought the lantern from him. The watchman got lost while my guy climbed\
  \ a narrow stair beneath the boardwalk.</p> \n    <p>I followed him down. The beach\
  \ stank of fish and seaweed, and the lantern light cast long shadows across the\
  \ pebbled shore.</p> \n    <p>The other fellow rolled up his sleeves as I moved\
  \ in, showing off just how big his arms were. The way he did it reminded me of the\
  \ bouncers back at the brothel. In fact, everything about him reminded me of those\
  \ bouncers, like they were imitating him when they used that gesture.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>He just put up his fists and beckoned me to come on. I kissed my thumb, drew\
  \ the wings of Desna on my heart, and went in.</p> \n    <p>The guy surprised me\
  \ with a quick, long punch. I got my arms up barely in time, but he smashed my guard\
  \ back into my face.</p> \n    <p>He fought in the classic style, fingernails up\
  \ for inspection, thumbs outside. I bounced back, slid to the side, and went in\
  \ for a shot to the ribs. He shot back with a one-two that cracked my wrist and\
  \ smashed my ear. I danced away, grinning with a confidence I didn't feel. He rushed\
  \ me again.</p> \n    <p>I put a dock piling between us. He came around, and I ran\
  \ behind another one. I needed to think. All those great moves I'd learned in Tian\
  \ Xia were scrambled in my head. I'd learned them while stuck in a devil body. Now\
  \ that it was gone, I didn't feel them the way I had for the past year. I had to\
  \ think about them, and that made me slow.</p> \n    <p>\"You going to run, run\
  \ now,\" he said. \"Just don't let me see you back at my brothel.\"</p> \n    <div\
  \ class=\"blurb360\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-RadovanJacket.jpg\"\

  \ \n    <p><i>Your</i> brothel?</p> \n    <p>I came around the piling, fists high.\
  \ When his shoulder dropped for a punch, I Swept the Beach. My foot barely caught\
  \ his heel, but quick as spite he stomped my ankle. He put all his weight down,\
  \ pinning me.</p> \n    <p>He walked up my leg. I tried kicking him, but he caught\
  \ my other foot and twisted hard. He got a scream, but not as much as he wanted.\
  \ He raised a foot to crush my gnarlies. </p> \n    <p>I winced, expecting the pain\
  \ but knowing it'd be worse for him. He must have seen it on my face. At the last\
  \ instant, he turned just enough to smash my thigh instead of impaling his foot\
  \ on my spiked cup.</p> \n    <p>I scissored my legs around his foot and rolled.\
  \ We both went down, tumbling over the stones. A dead crab tore the hell out of\
  \ my cheek. The guy got his finger in my ear, moved to put a thumb in my eye. I\
  \ kneed him in the gut and tried to roll away, but he hung on.</p> \n    <p>His\
  \ size and strength gave him the advantage. We fought with knees and elbows, which\
  \ gave it back to me. I bloodied his hip with a spur. He pulled a razor from his\
  \ belt and damned near drew me a new smile.</p> \n    <p>\"Stupid son of a bitch,\
  \ I wasn't going to kill you,\" I growled.</p> \n    <p>\"You think you're the first?\
  \ I'm sick of it. Once I'm done with you, I'm going to kill that whore.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>I pushed away the hand with the razor in it. Then I let it come back, only\
  \ this time I turned my head and opened wide. I'm not proud to be a biter, but you\
  \ got to go with your strengths.</p> \n    <p>He lost the razor along with most\
  \ of the use of that hand.</p> \n    <p>\"I'll kill her slow,\" he gasped. \"Believe\
  \ it.\"</p> \n    <p>Before I could answer, he smashed my nose with a head-butt.\
  \ The pain blinded me. He pushed me away. We got to our feet, blinking and reeling.\
  \ Somebody kicked the lantern, sending the world spinning under the docks. I closed\
  \ my eyes and listened for his breath. I charged, catching him right in the breadbasket.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>We fell into the surf. His head hit something hard, but not hard enough\
  \ to knock him out. He fought for his life, because that's what we were fighting\
  \ for now. I got his ear in one hand, a hank of hair in the other. I shoved his\
  \ head under the water.</p> \n    <p>His fingers found my throat. For a second I\
  \ faltered. His head came up. \"You don't know who you're dealing with! You'll never\
  \ get out of Absalom ali—\"</p> \n    <p>I put his head back under and counted.\
  \ At thirteen I let him up again. He sputtered, \"I'll pay you!\"</p> \n    <p>That\
  \ got my attention. \"What about Iolanda?\"</p> \n    <p>\"You can buy out her contract.\
  \ She gambles it all away anyway. You can win it back like I did.\"</p> \n    <p><i>He\
  \ beat me</i>. Those had been her words. I'd just assumed she meant the other thing.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Which was what she'd been betting on. </p> \n    <p>This guy was her\
  \ pimp, not a bad customer. Iolanda knew he wouldn't let things go if I just beat\
  \ him. If he went back to kill her, it was her own damned fault.</p> \n    <p>Still.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Tell me you won't lay a hand on her,\" I said. \"Make me believe it.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"I swear.\"</p> \n    <p>His eyes flicked down as he said it. </p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Sorry, pal.\" I put his head back under. \"I believed you the first\
  \ time.\"</p> \n    <p align=\"center\">∗∗∗</p> \n    <p>It was just after dawn\
  \ when I hopped out of the carriage in front of the boss's little clubhouse. Smoke\
  \ rose from a blackened building. The boss stood beside a scorched semicircle in\
  \ the lawn, standing straight while a couple of Pathfinder mucky-mucks chewed him\
  \ out. Arnisant caught my eye like he wanted to escape, so I called him over and\
  \ scratched his jaw.</p> \n    <p>When the shouting was done, the boss came over\
  \ with a fire-crippled servant carrying his satchel. The boss stopped when he saw\
  \ the cab. \"I have been too long without the Red Carriage,\" he said. \"Back to\
  \ the inn. We shall collect our things and take the first ship to Greengold.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>That was fine by me. I'd be glad if we never saw this damned town again.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Arnisant followed the boss into the cab, and the burned servant offered\
  \ me the boss's bag.</p> \n    <p>I said, \"You want to help with the luggage?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>He hesitated, glancing back at the smoldering building. I could tell\
  \ he wanted an excuse to leave but needed a little incentive. I held up the purse\
  \ I'd taken from Iolanda's pimp. \"I'll make it worth your while.\"</p> \n    <p><b>Coming\
