  >Meet the Iconics: Ezren</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Friday, October 26, 2007</p>\
  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\">\n     For many adventurers, wanderlust strikes\
  \ at a young age when minds are impressionable and the urge to escape the doldrums\
  \ of homelife become too much to resist. In other cases, there's never a choice\
  \ at all—being raised on the streets leaves few other options available for those\
  \ who do not wish to become criminals. Rarest are those who come to adventuring\
  \ late in life.\n    <p></p> \n    <p>This was Ezren's path to adventure. Born to\
  \ a successful spice merchant in one of Absalom's more affluent districts, Ezren's\
  \ childhood was pleasantly safe. As the fourth of six siblings, he never knew the\
  \ responsibility implicit in being the eldest (and therefore the one expected to\
  \ carry on father's trade) or the freedom of being the youngest. He enjoyed the\
  \ comforts of a well-to-do family, lived in a neighborhood relatively safe from\
  \ crime, and seemed poised for a life of mediocrity.</p> \n    <p>That changed when\
  \ his father was taken away, charged with heresy by the church of Abadar. The charges\
  \ were too spurious to stick, and while his father escaped excommunication, the\
  \ damage had been done—his father's business fell to pieces. Shocked, dismayed,\
  \ and convinced that his father was innocent, Ezren abandoned his future and spent\
  \ his adult life trying to repair his father's ruined reputation. So when Ezren\
  \ finally uncovered irrefutable proof of his father's guilt, and he realized he'd\
  \ wasted his life on a lie, he turned his evidence over to the church and said goodbye\
  \ to his home, his family, and his life.</p> \n    <p>At the age of 42, Ezren is\
  \ full aware that he's missed his adulthood, yet at the same time he looks forward\
  \ to discovering the world, and making a difference for a cause that he believes\
  \ in. His dissatisfaction with family, religion, and government left him precious\
  \ little to trust but his own intellect—in fighting for his father's redemption,\
  \ he had become a gifted researcher, scholar, and intellectual. Lacking the spry\
  \ limbs of youth, the trust in religion, the strong arm of the soldier, or the way\
  \ with words of the politician, Ezren felt he had but one option open. He traveled\
  \ to tarnished Oppara, capital of Taldor and one of the oldest cities of the continent\
  \ of Avistan, hoping to join one of several prestigious schools of wizardry. Yet\
  \ time and time again, he was turned away due to his age. No wizard seemed to want\
  \ an apprentice who, in many cases, was older than them. So Ezren was forced to\
  \ strike out on his own once again.</p> \n    <p>Over the next decade, as he traveled\
  \ Avistan, Ezren studied where he could, picking up tricks of the wizard's trade\
  \ here and there. The combination of arcane study mixed with his worldly first-hand\
  \ experiences have given him an edge over young wizards fresh out of apprenticeship\
  \ and eager to make names for themselves. Ezren knows about the many ways the world\
  \ can trick and betray you, but now he's finally begun to master the art of magic,\
  \ giving him the tools to fight back.</p> \n    <p>Ezren is scheduled to make his\
  \ debut as a pregenerated character in <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7zdb\">volume 7</a>\
  \ of Pathfinder and in GameMastery module <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7zdi\">U2: Hangman's\
  \ Noose</a>.</p> \n    <p>James Jacobs<br> Editor-in-Chief, <i>Pathfinder</i></p>\
