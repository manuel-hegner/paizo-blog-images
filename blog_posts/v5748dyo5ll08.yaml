  \ \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">The Scoured Stars incident shaped the narrative\
  \ at the launch of the Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild. That momentous—some\
  \ say would say, catastrophic—event set the stage for the campaign's first season\
  \ and the ongoing mystery of the Scoured Stars. With the recent unveiling of <a\

  ><i>Starfinder Society #1-99: The Scoured Stars Invasion</i></a>, we on the Organized\
  \ Play team thought it was a great time to look back in history to before the campaign\
  \ started. Specifically, let's learn of the First Seeker who first brought the Starfinder\
  \ Society into the Scoured Stars: First Seeker Jadnura.</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  ></a> \n     <br><i>Illustration by Graey Erb</i>\n     <p></p>\n    </div> \n \
  \   <p>Jadnura joined the Starfinder Society after spending years honing his talents\
  \ as a solarian within the Pradulex Monastery onboard the kasatha colony ship, <i>Idari</i>.\
  \ Looking for a proper way to utilize his considerable talents, Jadnura joined the\
  \ Starfinder Society, training within the halls of the Lorespire Complex along many\
  \ notable Starfinder agents, such as a young Fitch and Naiaj. Jadnura preferred\
  \ missions that took him to the fringes of explored space, and he specialized in\
  \ exploring seemingly hostile environments. It was during his time as a field agent\
  \ that Jadnura came across a mystical relic known as the <i>Tear </i>(as in \"to\
  \ cry tears\") on an otherwise dead volcanic world.</p> \n    <p>When agents of\
  \ the Lorespire Complex examined the <i>Tear</i>, they learned the device seemed\
  \ to have some connection with the distant realm of the Scoured Stars—a trinary\
  \ star system known to host a plethora hostile lifeforms and an abundance of malign\
  \ outsiders. Using the <i>Tear </i>as a physical means of pointing the Society's\
  \ interest at the Scoured Stars, Jadnura used his considerable charm and personal\
  \ drive to attain the mantle of First Seeker, with his ultimate goal being the full\
  \ exploration of the Scoured Stars. The rest, they say, is history…</p> \n    <h2>Second\
  \ Seekers (Jadnura)</h2> \n    <p>Like his successor, Luwazi Elsebo, there were\
  \ (and still are) many Starfinders keen to support Jadnura in his role as First\
  \ Seeker. These Starfinders united under the longstanding \"Second Seekers\" faction,\
  \ with their aims directed at exploring the Scoured Stars and enacting Jadnura's\
  \ trademark \"lead from the front\" philosophy of exploration. Some of these agents\
  \ managed to avoid the Scoured Stars incident, whereas others more recently heard\
  \ of Jadnura's many endearing qualities and have chosen to serve him above the current\
  \ nominal First Seeker. Where Luwazi Elsebo dedicated her nominated First Seeker\
  \ term to re-unifying and reconstructing the Society, those following Jadnura have\
  \ remained focused on their First Seeker's specific goal: unraveling the mysteries\
  \ of the Scoured Stars.</p> \n    <p>With a return to the Scoured Stars, it's inevitable\
  \ that we'll learn a bit more about Jadnura, so for those spoiler-conscious folks\
  \ out there, I'll keep some of the particulars hidden below:</p> \n    <blockquote>\

  \ Stars Invasion Spoilers</b> \n      <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"\
  spoilerButton\" onclick=\"toggleSpoiler(this)\">\n      <div class=\"spoiler-text\"\
  > \n       <p>Ok… so the big news from this year's interactive special is that JADNURA\
  \ IS BACK! That's right, as part of the climactic unfolding of the interactive special,\
  \ the Starfinder Society has recovered the missing First Seeker and extricated him\
  \ (and other survivors back to the Pact Worlds)! Of course, this leads to some interesting\
  \ questions about how leadership within the Starfinder Society is going to be working\
  \ going forward.</p> \n       <p>Over the coming months, we'll be looking at introducing\
  \ Jadnura to our players through upcoming scenarios. This includes several scenarios\
  \ that include the Faction (Second Seekers [Jadnura]) tag. Jadnura is going to play\
  \ a major role in our upcoming stories, not to mention defining his relationship\
  \ with nominated First Seeker Luwazi Elsebo. We wanted to give the interactive some\
  \ time to play across all our major events before we revealed this massive lore\
  \ development in a public way, and now that the summer convention season is winding\
  \ down, expect to see product pages and updates for these scenarios in the near\
  \ future.</p> \n       <p>Finally, if you played the interactive special, then you\
  \ know that there's the potential to earn your first Reputation with Second Seekers\
  \ (Jadnura). This was just a light tease of what we've had planned. I humbly request\
  \ that you don't spoil this in the comments below, as I try to be somewhat vague\
  \ with our spoiler-free players about how this new faction is going to play into\
  \ our campaign's future!</p> \n      </div>\n     </div> \n    </blockquote> \n\
  \    <p>For those of you interested in joining the Second Seekers (Jadnura) faction\
  \ to honor the lost First Seeker, I have some good news! With the upcoming release\
  \ of the next update to the <a href=\"/products/btpy9vlp?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Guide\"\
  ><i>Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild Guide</i></a> (sometime around late October\
  \ or early November) we'll be introducing a whole section on this faction. The plan\
  \ is to include a variety of boons along the lines of what you've seen with other\
  \ factions. If you've seen the release of our limited-release first minor faction,\
  \ the Manifold Host, I assure you that this will include a lot more faction-facing\
  \ content.</p> \n    <p>Ok, alright, fine, I may have one more spoiler…</p> \n \
  \   <blockquote> \n     <div style=\"margin: 10px 0;\">\n      <b>Starfinder #1-99:\

  spoiler-text\"> \n       <p>With Jadnura's sudden return to the Starfinder Society,\
  \ he's become quite interested in what's transpired in his absence. I know there's\
  \ a lot of players out there who've been interested in replaying previously played\
  \ content, and I'll give a strong hint that Jadnura has your back! (In boon form,\
  \ if not with his ridiculous heavy weapon as well!)</p> \n      </div>\n     </div>\
  \ \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>I understand that waiting several months is a bit\
  \ of a tease. I also understand that it's even more of a tease to preview all this\
  \ without a means of actually getting into the faction. So, let it be known that\
  \ I'm a generous developer. <b>The following boon is available to all characters\
  \ as of the posting of this blog and will be reprinted in the next update to the\
  \ Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild Guide. New characters created following this\
