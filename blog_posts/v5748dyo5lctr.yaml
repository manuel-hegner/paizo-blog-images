  \ class=\"PTales\"></div></a> \n    <h1>Blood and Money</h1> \n    <p>by Steven\
  \ Savile</p> \n    <h2>Chapter Three: Fortune Favors the Dead</h2> \n    <p>For\
  \ Isra to claim that he was a master of disguise was akin to saying cash was king\
  \ down in the Nightstalls, capable of buying everything from rare strains of poison\
  \ to souls, either figuratively or literally depending on which gossip you listened\
  \ to. It was well known that commerce was the only god worth praying to. That was\
  \ the essence of the Golden City. </p> \n    <p>It went without saying.</p> \n \
  \   <p>But it was also wonderfully understated.</p> \n    <p>Disguise wasn’t simply\
  \ an essential talent given the Nightwalker’s line of work; it was something the\
  \ assassin took peculiar delight in. Isra Darzi had always been fascinated with\
  \ masks, and how a man might be one thing and appear quite another. The greatest\
  \ mask of all was the one he wore every day when he pretended to be himself, and\
  \ that one required no mask at all.</p> \n    <p>Passing himself off as the would-be\
  \ assassin had been deceptively simple. All he had needed to do was switch animal\
  \ heads and adjust his gait slightly. It was the most basic of physical theatrics,\
  \ but people were easily fooled, especially when they saw what they expected to\
  \ see. Faris expected his brother-in-law to be the one doing the dying, so Isra\
  \ gave the man what he needed. He made sure his brother-in-law caught a glimpse\
  \ of him making his escape, then discarded the mask and moved quickly to retrieve\
  \ and dispose of the body he’d thrown from the balcony. It suited his purpose for\
  \ Faris to believe that his assassin was still alive. Isra was confident, almost\
  \ arrogant as he walked through a room, because if he didn’t already own it, he\
  \ almost certainly could if he so desired. The new walk gave the impression of someone\
  \ with far less confidence and a more furtive nature.</p> \n    <p>Part of him still\
  \ refused to believe that Faris was behind the contract. After all, they were close.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Friends.</p> \n    <p>Isra dredged his memory for things that had transpired\
  \ between them, trying to recall any possible slight, but coming up with nothing.\
  \ Was it money? Jealousy? Some half-assed notion of prestige? Did Faris expect to\
  \ inherit everything—the house, the businesses, the network of contacts and traders\
  \ spread out across the kingdom—after his brother-in-law’s death? </p> \n    <p>Isra\
  \ barked out a bitter laugh. Faris was going to be in for one hell of rude awakening\
  \ when the will was read and named the boy, Munir, as Isra’s heir, with Mirza as\
  \ his agent, acting as trustee to ensure his interests were looked after until the\
  \ boy was of an age to assume control himself. </p> \n    <p>The assassin had never\
  \ expected this to be a permanent arrangement, assuming that he would have a son\
  \ of his own eventually. He had wanted to ensure that the family wealth would not\
  \ only remain within the family, but be tied to it by blood, rather than by something\
  \ as ephemeral as lust.</p> \n    <p>Isra’s head was full of treachery as he walked\
  \ through the bazaar.</p> \n    <p>The Obari winds blew unfettered through the tents\
  \ and stalls. The sea breeze offered blessed relief from the hot winds that had\
  \ been blowing in off the Mwangi Expanse. </p> \n    <p>The bazaar was full of bustling\
  \ life. Everything they said about the Emporium was true: everything was for sale\
  \ here, no matter how esoteric or exotic. Isra made his way to a less familiar part\
  \ of the tent city, the air rich with heady spices that in no way masked the redolent\
  \ tang of narcotics. Open pitches and overflowing tables spilled out into the narrow\
  \ allies between the traders’ tents. Many of the merchants had traveled far from\
  \ Katapesh to bring back the toys and trinkets of distant lands. The further, the\
  \ rarer, the most costly. </p> \n    <p>Representatives of the trade guilds walked\
  \ the aisles, making sure that their pay masters weren’t being cheated out of their\
  \ due. More often than not they looked like grubby-faced urchins and downtrodden\
  \ souls. Without official emblems, their affiliations were impossible to tell. </p>\
  \ \n    <p>Over the belling tops of the tents, one of the many minarets of Katapesh\
  \ pierced the clear blue sky. This one was part of Abadar’s temple. It was also\
  \ the tower from which Hashim Rakhman’s guard captain had taken his swan dive.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>A shock of white hair cut across Isra’s path, the sharp-nosed Garundi\
  \ turning to look him straight in the eye, then turning away. There was a moment,\
  \ when their eyes locked, that Isra thought the Garundi was another one of his brother-in-law’\
  s pets, but the man seemed to realize he was staring and broke eye contact without\
  \ so much as twitching, never mind reaching for a hidden blade. Isra was tempted\
  \ to ask for directions, just to prolong the man’s discomfort, but decided against\
  \ it, primarily because he didn’t fancy removing the scarf from his face. Why increase\
  \ the risk of being recognized just for a little sport? His intention was no grander\
  \ than anonymity. He wanted people to see a man lost in the maze of stalls and tents.\
  \ Thousands of people a day passed through the bazaar, making the chances of being\
  \ recognized slim. Pulling away the scarf, even for just a moment, took that slim\
  \ possibility and raised it. How high, he had no way of knowing, but it wasn’t worth\
  \ the risk.</p> \n    <p>The hook was baited. He had sent a message to Faris, supposedly\
  \ from his hired knife, despite the fact that her corpse could quite happily rot\
  \ in its current resting palace for months without ever being found. He didn’t need\
  \ months, he only needed hours. The message had said simply: “<i>Bara the Fortune-Teller’\
  s tent. Sunset.</i>” </p> \n    <p>Isra arrived early and paid the fortune-teller\
  \ off, buying the tent for an hour with enough coin to almost certainly buy the\
  \ pitch outright. He didn’t want to be disturbed. He had a feeling things could\
  \ quickly turn ugly, especially if his brother-in-law didn’t come alone. Isra had\
  \ long since learned to trust his gut instincts. </p> \n    <p>Faris sent his two\
  \ bodyguards in first, then entered the tent himself. </p> \n    <p>Isra stepped\
  \ in close and grabbed the first guard, twisting his wrist until the man cried out\
  \ in pain, then twisted some more, pushing hard on the elbow and breaking the man’\
  s arm in one swift, precise movement. He cast the man aside, ramming an elbow into\
  \ his temple as he stumbled. The guard’s legs buckled and he went down. He wasn’\
  t going to be getting up in a hurry. </p> \n    <p>The second guard had no more\
  \ luck, despite the fact that he had drawn his knife and lunged towards Isra. The\
  \ assassin’s instincts saved his life. He stepped aside from the blow, grasped the\
  \ bodyguard’s arm at wrist and elbow, and turned the blade back on its wielder.\
  \ The curved knife sank deep into the stunned man’s chest. A blood-red rose blossomed\
  \ on his shirt. The moment of shock was all it took for Isra to finish him. </p>\
  \ \n    <p>Isra hadn’t wanted this; death had never been his intention.</p> \n \
  \   <p>“Their deaths are on your hands,” Isra spat. “I hope your money’s good in\
  \ the afterlife.”</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Faris.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Faris_360.jpeg\" border=\"0\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> \"Not even family comes between Faris and profit.\"\n    </div>\
  \ \n    <p>Faris turned on his heel, looking to flee, but Isra hooked a foot out\
  \ and dumped him on his face. The man went down with a grunt, reaching out for the\
  \ tent flaps of the door to stop himself from falling and nearly pulling the entire\
  \ construction down on top of them. With all the noise, there was no way the other\
  \ stallholders could have failed to hear what was going on, but discretion in this\
  \ case was the best way to keep trouble from their own door. The bazaar lived on\
  \ a basic premise: it’s always someone else’s problem.</p> \n    <p>“Money?” Faris\
  \ snapped, only hearing the one word and ignoring the rest as he blustered and struggled\
  \ to rise. “You've had your money, and I've still no proof that the bastard is dead.\
  \ Without his body, I cannot claim his place, so you can forget all about money.”\
  </p> \n    <p>So, when it came down to it, this was all about money after all. </p>\
  \ \n    <p>Blood and money. </p> \n    <p>Isra removed the scarf from his face.\
  \ He savored the shock and fear as it crept over Faris’s own.</p> \n    <p>“How...?”\
  \ The man sank back down. He looked, quite literally, as though he had seen a ghost,\
  \ which of course he had. “You’re dead... I saw...”</p> \n    <p>“The question isn’\
  t ‘how,’ <i>brother</i>, it’s ‘why.’ Why would you want me dead? Why did you think\
  \ that you’d be able to take my place? If you had asked me for anything, I would\
  \ have given it to you. Anything at all.”</p> \n    <p>“Give?” Faris spat. “I don't\
  \ want your <i>charity</i>! I want more than that. I deserve it!”</p> \n    <p>Isra\
  \ was torn. He wanted the best for his sister, Sana, and for his nephew. They were\
  \ the innocents in all of this, but they were the ones that were going to pay the\
  \ highest price. Killing Faris would destroy them, even if they never knew who was\
  \ behind his death. </p> \n    <p>“There’s only one thing you deserve, Faris,” he\
  \ said slowly. “But fortunately for you, I love my sister more than I hate you.\
  \ So there has to be away out of this—some way we can both get some sort of satisfactory\
  \ resolution that doesn’t involve spilling your guts all over this tent.” He thought\
  \ about it for a moment. “You want to be in charge? You want control over the family\
  \ interests? You’d consider that a victory?”</p> \n    <p>“Of course,” Faris said.\
  \ “But that’s not going to happen now, is it?” He gestured to the two dead men.\
  \ </p> \n    <p>Isra followed the direction of his movement, but his mind was elsewhere.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>This was the moment. It all came down to this.</p> \n    <p>Could he\
  \ trust Faris? What would happen if he gave the man the opportunity to play the\
  \ part he wanted so desperately?</p> \n    <p>Suddenly, Isra wanted to laugh. They\
  \ were in the middle of a fortune-teller’s tent, dead men left and right, and he\
  \ was trying to look into the future. He might as well look into the crystal ball\
  \ now and ask the mists to part...</p> \n    <p>“What are you thinking, Isra?” Faris\
  \ suddenly sounded like Isra’s brother-in-law again, rather than the man who’d paid\
  \ money for his death. “Talk to me.” </p> \n    <p>And then, as Isra knew it would,\
  \ came the question he had hoped his brother-in-law wouldn’t ask. </p> \n    <p>“\
  Where did you learn to fight like that? How did you manage to overcome...?” Faris\
  \ didn’t quite finish the thought. He didn’t need to.</p> \n    <p>“The assassin\
  \ you sent to kill me?” Isra said bluntly.</p> \n    <p>Faris nodded.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>Isra made a decision. “I have a secret, Faris. I’m going to tell you something\
  \ now that will change the course of your life, and mine; a secret that has been\
  \ gnawing away at me for a long time now. It is an itch that needs to be scratched.”\
  \ He locked eyes with the man on the floor. “You might say that I’m two people.\
  \ There’s the Isra you know—or think you know—and there’s the other me, the other\
  \ Isra that’s now consuming my life. Making money offers no thrill. There’s no pleasure\
  \ in a deal well struck. Not compared to my other life.” He crouched down so that\
  \ the two of them were on the same level. “You see, I am the one they call the Nightwalker.”\
  </p> \n    <p>The cogs whirred away behind Faris’ eyes. “You? No...” The fear returned,\
  \ yet as quickly as it came, a look of cunning stole in to replace it. </p> \n \
  \   <p>“Here’s what I’m thinking, Faris,” Isra said. “If you want to be the head\
  \ of the family so desperately, then why not? I could disappear. It wouldn’t be\
  \ difficult. I haven't been seen since the party, and it's not such a huge stretch\
  \ of the imagination to pretend that your assassin succeeded.”</p> \n    <p>Faris\
  \ thought about it for a moment. “What would you do?”</p> \n    <p>“I would be free\
  \ of the bonds that weigh me down, free to do something that I get satisfaction\
  \ out of. Something more challenging.”</p> \n    <p>“Killing people?”</p> \n   \
  \ <p>“Or just starting fresh without the expectation of being a drunk with too much\
  \ money and too little sense. I’m tired of this life, Faris.”</p> \n    <p>Faris\
  \ looked incredulous. “And you would be out of our lives for good?”</p> \n    <p>Isra\
  \ wasn’t going to lie. “No. Not for good. You’d have control of the day-to-day things,\
  \ but I’d still want a hand in decisions that affect the business. You would be\
  \ the public face of the family, the man everyone dealt with.”</p> \n    <p>“I’\
  d be your puppet, you mean?” Faris’s lip curled.</p> \n    <p>“That’s not how I’\
  d choose to see it.”</p> \n    <p>“How you’d <i>choose</i>? Your words are slippier\
  \ than a sand eel, Isra. I’d be your puppet, dancing to whatever string you decided\
  \ to pull.”</p> \n    <p>“Think about it, Faris. It's the best I can offer.”</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Faris laughed. “Oh, I shall think about it. Long and hard, <i>brother</i>.\
  \ I shall think about nothing but, but I shall bide my time. Decide in haste, repent\
  \ at leisure, as they say. I have much to consider. Perhaps I should just reveal\
  \ that our beloved Isra, patron of flophouses and pesh dens, is the fearsome Nightwalker?\
  \ Let’s see what becomes of you then. You think you have enemies now... imagine\
  \ what it’ll be like when half of Katapesh finds out you’re responsible for the\
  \ death of a friend, or family member, or employer. Go on, imagine—think about what\
  \ you’ve done, how your crimes have impacted their lives, and the ripples of them\
  \ spreading out from person to person. Imagine how much they hate you.” Faris smiled\
  \ grimly.</p> \n    <p>“I wouldn’t make threats if I were you,” Isra said.</p> \n\
  \    <p>“You wouldn't? I don’t believe that for a minute. You’re a bastard, Isra.”\
  </p> \n    <p>The man they called the Nighwalker looked at the huddled merchant\
  \ in front of him, seeing him properly for the first time, and realized that he\
  \ may have made the biggest mistake in his life by sharing his secret.</p> \n  \
  \  <p>It had to end here, one way or another.</p> \n    <p>“I tried to offer you\
  \ a way out of this, Faris, but you’re a bigger idiot than I gave you credit for.\
  \ I’m going to make you a promise now, and I want you to think very, very seriously\
  \ about it before you say anything. If you so much as <i>think</i> the word Nightwalker,\
  \ I will make sure you’re dead before the thought can reach your lips. I offered\
  \ you a way out because I love my sister, not out of any kindness I feel toward\
  \ you. You’ve mistaken love for weakness. Instead of taking me up on my kindness,\
  \ you’ve proven I can’t trust you. So here is my final offer: leave Katapesh and\
  \ live, or stay and die.”</p> \n    <p>“Leave Katapesh?” The merchant’s eyes were\
  \ wide, incredulous. “Are you serious?”</p> \n    <p>“Deadly,” Isra said, and stood.\
  \ “Take you wife and son and start a new life far away from here, Faris. Get on\
  \ the first boat out of the city and start fresh somewhere else. Be the head of\
  \ your own family, out of my shadow.</p> \n    <p>“Because if you’re still in Katapesh\
  \ when the moon rises, I will find you. And I will kill you.”</p> \n    <p><b>Coming\
