  description\">Propped on his black toenails, Fumbus craned to see the bearings on\
  \ the pretty brass compass. He swiveled an expectant grin back and forth between\
  \ the wizard and the wayfinder, not sure which face was harder to read. Colder still\
  \ was the reinforced door before them...though not for long. The fuse on the goblin’\
  s bomb was hissing shorter, apparently outside Ezren’s notice.</p>\n           \
  \   <p>“Through here?” Fumbus hoped.</p>\n              <p>Ezren opened his mouth\
  \ to answer—too late. The fuse’s hissing was sucked into that exciting split-second\
  \ silence before detonation. Then the bomb and Fumbus’s eyes blossomed red all at\
  \ once. A concussive ripple showered the companions in sparks and shards. The door\
  \ had blown ajar, the iron frame bent and peeled widest at the goblin’s height.\
  \ Ezren would have to squeeze.</p>\n              <p>The wizard shook the soot out\
  \ of his white hair. “I suspect so,” he coughed.</p>\n              <p>“Suspect?”\
  </p>\n              <p>“The previous inscription led here,” Ezren admitted, ducking\
  \ sideways through Fumbus’s opening. “But I hoped it wasn’t the last.” He ignited\
  \ a torch mounted inside the door and looked around. “Oh,” he sighed, letting his\
  \ staff and compass droop.</p>\n              <p>The door had been reinforced for\
  \ good reason. It guarded a haphazard treasury, its golden texture illuminated in\
  \ piles spread under the torchlight. <em>Half</em>-hazard, more like—the reflective\
  \ glow made up only the left side of the chamber. Nesting comfortably in its midst\
  \ was a chest larger than Fumbus, who thought it odd that so many coins lay outside\
  \ the container. It was as if it had burst its seams. An impressive find to be sure,\
  \ but the long-faced longshanks looked hungry for something else.</p>\n        \
  \      <p>“Mushrooms?” Fumbus offered helpfully. He’d collected them for their brewing\
  \ potential, but they made a swell snack in the meantime.</p>\n              <p>Ezren\
  \ only arched an eyebrow at the blue fungi in the goblin’s outstretched palm.</p>\n\
  \              <p>“Isn’t brain mold after all,” Fumbus reassured him. “I’m pretty\
  \ sure.”</p>\n              <p>“Never mind,” the wizard said. “It seems we’ve traced\
  \ the writing to its underwhelming and predictable conclusion.”</p>\n          \
  \    <p>“Drawings,” Fumbus reminded him for the tenth time.</p>\n              <p>“\
  Er, yes.” Ezren pointed at the cords of tokens around Fumbus’s neck. “Like those,\
  \ I suppose?”</p>\n              <p>The little alchemist patted the tokens, each\
  \ scratched with runes to depict his formulas. Their satisfying clicks were music\
  \ to his ears. Ezren had tried persuading him that symbolic pictures and “writing”\
  \ were the same thing, but the goblin knew better. “Exactly,” he said, and swallowed\
  \ more mushrooms.</p>\n              <p>He noticed then that he was stuck. Slime\
  \ stretched between his foot and the flagstones. He wasn’t sure if it was reagent\
  \ residue from his bomb or drool dripped while he snacked.</p>\n              <p>Ezren\
  \ had begun pacing in the meantime, ignoring all distractions any shorter than the\
  \ wayfinder open in his hand. He let it lead, thinking out loud, “The inscriptions\
  \ disappeared with each reading. Ending here? Yet there’s no…affirmation.” He paused,\
  \ stepping back to take in the whole chamber.</p>\n              <p>“Not mine after\
  \ all,” the goblin muttered to the string of goo hanging from his fingernail.</p>\n\
  \              <p>“Fumbus, what does the light in this chamber remind you of?”</p>\n\
  \              <p>“<em>Someone</em>’s spit, though.”</p>\n              <p>“Fumbus?”\
  </p>\n              <p>“Huh?” Fumbus followed Ezren’s back-and-forth gestures comparing\
  \ the glowing side of the room to the shadowy side. “Oh. It’s like that face the\
  \ Master of Spells prays to.”</p>\n              <p>“Indeed…” Ezren mused. He resumed\
  \ his pacing, this time straight toward the shadowed half. “A striking duality.\
  \ Perhaps a clue that all is not what it seems. Because, point of fact, the coordinates\
  \ don’t end at that door, but—” His next step triggered a faint, metallic ring that\
  \ echoed around the empty slot in his wayfinder. He froze as if afraid, thrilled\
  \ in fact, and spoke an incantation. A familiar blue glow spread in response, illuminating\
  \ an unseen ledge and the zigzag of stone steps leading up to it. The glow’s source\
  \ was a new inscription, and even Fumbus marveled at how much larger and longer\
  \ it was than the previous puzzles.</p>\n              <p>“Hmm…” the wizard purred\
  \ proudly. “I can read the writing on the wall.”</p>\n              <p>“Drawings,”\
  \ Fumbus corrected him.</p>\n              <p>Ezren gave no argument, already ascending\
  \ the first landing on his way to the ledge. Fumbus had been fascinated to watch\
  \ him decipher the other inscriptions, but the ritual had grown repetitive. He was\
  \ suddenly less concerned with the meaning behind the magic and more interested\
  \ in the mucus carpeting the chamber floor. It coated the gold coins like paste.\
  \ When one yielded to his tugging, he became suspicious whether it really was a\
  \ coin at all, but rather some kind of shed scale. He prepared to bite it to find\
  \ out for sure, then stopped with his cheeks spread wide.</p>\n              <p>The\
  \ chest was smiling at him.</p>\n              <p>He blinked and looked again. No,\
  \ it had been his imagination. The golden trim around the lid followed a curved\
  \ pattern, maybe even meant to resemble a sneering creature, but he was sure it\
  \ was resemblance only. Pretty sure.</p>\n              <p>From the ledge, Ezren\
  \ gave a triumphant shout. “A conjurer’s imprint! Of course. It’s the same inscription,\
  \ traveling each time. Relocating...”</p>\n              <p>Fumbus now had his nose\
  \ close to the mucus trail, sniffing and tracking it. Soon he stood knee-deep in\
  \ sticky coins. The chest was even larger up close; he could almost see his reflection\
  \ in its viscous sheen.</p>\n              <p>He yelped then, high-pitched and giddy,\
  \ because the chest’s golden lips parted and a pink tongue lashed out. Long and\
  \ twisted like a wet blanket, it snapped in the goblin’s face and sent him stumbling\
  \ backward.</p>\n              <p>Not his imagination!</p>\n              <div class=\"\

  \     </div>\n              <p>The chest shuffled toward him with eerie silence,\
  \ as if it would maintain its camouflage. Without taking his eyes from the creature,\
  \ Fumbus called to his companion. Ezren only hushed him back. This inscription was\
  \ longer, more complex than the others, and he needed time to unravel it. Fumbus\
  \ cursed the human’s unassailable focus.</p>\n              <p>The creature noticed\
  \ it, too. It must have decided Ezren himself was extremely assailable as a result,\
  \ because it changed course, crawling toward the stairs on at least eight tentacles.</p>\n\
  \              <p>Fumbus admired its cleverness. To disguise itself and then prey\
  \ on the distracted wizard? Maybe it was more intelligent than he assumed. He knew\
  \ from experience what a second chance could mean to a misunderstood monster. A\
  \ possible future flashed before his goggles: shaking tentacles with the creature;\
  \ taking it in; feeding it pickled whatevers; definitely requiring it to wear a\
  \ bell; putting its sticky mucus to good alchemical use…</p>\n              <p>But\
  \ now the creature slithered up the stairs, almost close enough to grab Ezren from\
  \ behind. Fumbus downed an elixir, which tasted like that feeling when your foot\
  \ falls asleep, and leaped over the creature onto the second landing. It reached\
  \ for him and he pelted it with bombs almost faster than he could light them. Each\
  \ stuck first and exploded second, like orange geysers erupting on the creature’\
  s hide. But tongue and tentacles kept whipping.</p>\n              <p>“Drawings…\
  ” Ezren muttered up on his ledge.</p>\n              <p>The creature turned toward\
  \ the unsuspecting wizard again, craning like an actual chest on stilts.</p>\n \
  \             <p>In a panic, Fumbus prepared something different, injecting a spongy\
  \ pellet with a rolling chemical mixture. The sponge instantly swelled four times\
  \ larger and hardened in reaction, now a brittle shell filled with something hot\
  \ and hungry. Even so, the goblin risked a delay and even an accidental discharge:\
  \ He hid the ball behind his back and whistled at the creature, hoping it would\
  \ take the bait.</p>\n              <p>It did. Mouth open wide to expose not treasure\
  \ or goodies, but rows of jagged teeth, it flicked its tongue and stretched its\
  \ pseudopods at Fumbus...who moved. Like a toad with a fly, the creature snatched\
  \ Fumbus’s bomb from midair and stowed it in its chest-mouth. First the split-second\
  \ silence; then it stretched wide with a muffled pop. Its tentacles shuddered. Its\
  \ tongue spilled out like steaming entrails, shriveled and white with acidic burns.\
  \ Its body oozed off the stones and down the stairs.</p>\n              <p>Fumbus\
  \ sucked his teeth mournfully. “Not so smart, I guess.”</p>\n              <p>“\
  Oh, that seems a bit harsh,” Ezren said, turning away from the wall at last. “Though\
  \ I do owe you my thanks.”</p>\n              <p>The goblin shrugged and fiddled\
  \ with his dogslicer, both pleased and embarrassed.</p>\n              <p>The wizard’\
  s wrinkled scowl softened into a smile and he pointed. “Drawings.”</p>\n       \
  \       <p>Fumbus clutched his formula tokens. “Huh?”</p>\n              <p>“Drawings!\
  \ You were right after all. The inscription isn’t an affirmation or command, but\
  \ a combination lock. Read the runes wrong and they relocate, growing longer. But\
  \ shuffle them correctly and…”</p>\n              <p>One by one he touched his staff\
  \ to the magically bright symbols, but in a seemingly random order. Each glowed\
  \ brighter as he did, until the entire inscription had been activated. It shifted\
  \ then, rearranging in the order Ezren designated. The arched pattern swirled and\
  \ bled together until the runes were gone, merged into a single shape: a yawning\
  \ portal. A milky film of magic disguised where it led, but Fumbus had a feeling\
  \ it wasn’t to the other side of the wall.</p>\n              <p>That metallic ring\
  \ echoed off Ezren’s wayfinder again. He studied it, nodded resolutely, and clapped\
  \ it shut. “Right. On we go! But maybe less noise on the other side, eh, Fumbus?\
  \ Never know what creatures might be lurking.”</p>\n              <p>The goblin\
  \ opened his mouth to reply...and filled it with blue mushrooms instead.</p>\n \
