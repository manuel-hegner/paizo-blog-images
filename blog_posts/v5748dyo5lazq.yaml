  \ \n   <p>If I haven’t already filled your ear about it on the messageboards, the\
  \ story behind the book is as follows. Back in the early days of Planet Stories,\
  \ I came to Erik with a proposal for an anthology: What if we could get 15 of the\
  \ biggest living superstars in science fiction and fantasy to give us their first\
  \ published SF stories, along with interviews in which they critiqued their own\
  \ stories, discussed things they know now about writing that they wish they had\
  \ known then, told anecdotes surrounding the stories’ publication, and offered general\
  \ advice to aspiring authors? Erik took the bait, and so began the long march toward\
  \ the collection that would eventually be known as <a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy8b8p\"\
  ><i>Before They Were Giants</i></a>.</p> \n   <p>By far the most astonishing thing\
  \ about working on this book was discovering how open, friendly, and approachable\
  \ many of my favorite speculative fiction authors are. When the dust settled and\
  \ I looked around, I was positively flabbergasted by the caliber of authors who\
  \ were willing to sign onto the project, from Ben Bova and Cory Doctorow to China\
  \ Miéville, Nicola Griffith, and William Gibson. And while I confess that the final\
  \ author list directly reflects my own literary tastes, every author in the book\
  \ is a master of the genre in one way or another, and reading through their interviews\
  \ and advice—not to mention their maiden efforts, which run the gamut from humorous\
  \ magical realist vignettes to post-apocalyptic satellite repair—is precisely the\
  \ sort of thing that I always find fun, educational... and most importantly, inspiring.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>As we get closer to actually shipping the book to subscribers and bookstores,\
  \ I’ll probably be posting more about the project, including select excerpts from\
  \ stories and author interviews. But for now, I just wanted to crow a little bit\
  \ about what is, for me personally, the most exciting Planet Stories book to date.\
  \ (Well, that and to show off the absolutely phenomenal cover by Kieran Yanner!)</p>\
