  description\">Those of you with high Perception modifiers will notice that this\
  \ section has a new title. As of Monday, I have been promoted to Paizo’s <b>Organized\
  \ Play Coordinator</b>! This is a very exciting change that Tonya and I have been\
  \ working toward for a while. I am now responsible for most of the day-to-day operations\
  \ of the program, as well as the long-term planning for Organized Play. It’s a lot\
  \ of responsibility, but I’m very excited by the prospect!</p> \n     <p>Tonya,\
  \ meanwhile, has taken on some new responsibilities as Paizo’s first <b>Director\
  \ of Community</b>! While she still supervises me and the Organized Play Program,\
  \ she is also now supervising the Customer Service team, managing our company convention\
  \ presence, as well as working to strengthen interactions between members of all\
  \ Paizo communities: our players, customers, staff, freelancers, streamers, and\
  \ more. </p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p><em>From Tonya: I’ve spent just under\
  \ 6 years shepherding Paizo’s Organized Play programs. With this handoff, I’m not\
  \ out of the picture, but my role becomes more strategic and less tactical, as I\
  \ instead focus on planning, integration with Paizo as a whole, and contributing\
  \ to the bigger picture. Which means I won’t be as visible in day-to-day activities,\
  \ as Alex steps into many of the travel and communication duties. This is bittersweet,\
  \ as I relish the challenges of my new role but will miss the friends and experiences\
  \ I had as both the OPC and the OPM. I’ve watched Alex grow into the role and am\
  \ confident in his ability to deliver a quality program, alongside Linda and the\
  \ developers. Please join me in congratulating Alex on his promotion! Huzzah!</em></p>\

  \ with the big news: <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq027uy?Pathfinder-Secrets-of-Magic\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Secrets of Magic</em></a> is now sanctioned for Pathfinder Society!\
  \ The character options are now available to all characters in the campaign as listed\
  \ on the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/characteroptions\">Character\
  \ Options page</a>. For Starfinder Society, we’ve sanctioned <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq029vf?Starfinder-Adventure-Junkers-Delight\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Adventure: Junker’s Delight</em></a> for both play and character\
  \ options, and we’ve also gotten the options from the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventures/adventurePath/devastationArk\"\
  ><em>Devastation Ark</em> Adventure Path</a> out the door. Which means... we’re\
  \ caught up on both programs! How about that?</p> \n     <p>Of course, next month\
  \ we have <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq029xk?Pathfinder-Guns-Gears\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Guns &amp; Gears</em></a>, <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq029xo?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-The-Grand-Bazaar\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Grand Bazaar</em></a>, and <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq029v8?Starfinder-Tech-Revolution\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Tech Revolution</em></a>, not to mention a number of new adventures.\
  \ So, we have much more on the way very soon! For now, enjoy our newest offerings!</p>\
  \ \n     <h2>GM Recognition</h2> \n     <p>At PaizoCon Online Europe, we awarded\
  \ three new Campaign Service Coins. These Coins are given to volunteers who go above\
  \ and beyond the typical volunteer duties to support their communities and Organized\
  \ Play. Nominations are always accepted; volunteers may be nominated by emailing\
  \ <a href=\"mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com\">organizedplay@paizo.com</a> with their\
  \ name, region and a description of their service. As we begin to return to physical\
  \ events, we hope to resume awarding these in-person, so letting us know what upcoming\
  \ events they’re attending is also useful.</p> \n     <p>Congratulations to our\
  \ new Campaign Coin holders:<br> <b>847</b> Tom Mannering<br> <b>848</b> Andrew\
  \ Wilson<br> <b>849</b> Chris Manning</p> \n     <h2>Upcoming Conventions</h2> \n\
  \     <p>This month is our final major convention of the year: Gen Con Online! The\
  \ catalog is live and tickets are on sale for all our events now. We hope you’re\
  \ looking forward to the premiere of our newest interactive specials, as well as\
  \ the rest of our events at the best four days in gaming.</p> \n     <p>Remember\
  \ that you can always check out the list of upcoming events using the new <a href=\"\
