  \ mere days from getting ahold of Starfinder’s new <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq0206c?Starfinder-Character-Operations-Manual\"\
  >Character Operations Manual</a>, a book that’s overflowing with new character options.\
  \ Although I didn’t get to work on this book directly, I got the benefit of flipping\
  \ through all of its fancy new feats and class features with the exuberance of a\
  \ fan—a pleasure I experience far less often as a developer.</p> \n      <p><b>Envoy</b>:\
  \ The envoy gets all sorts of potent new alternate features that let your PC become\
  \ the combat-negotiator they always dreamed of becoming—or wield mystical spells\
  \ in addition to their charismatic tricks. However, the one that captures my attention\
  \ is called polymorphic disguise. With this alternate class feature, your envoy\
  \ can ditch their expertise ability and instead become a shapechanger! You can design\
  \ your envoy’s alternate form using the <i>polymorph</i> spell (from <i>Alien Archive\
  \ 2</i>), and your envoy always adds their expertise die when disguising themselves\
  \ in that form. As your envoy gains levels, their shapeshifting power improves by\
  \ using higher and higher levels of the <i>polymorph</i> spell. What’s more, in\
  \ place of learning new expertise talents, your envoy can instead learn additional\
  \ forms to expand their shapechanging arsenal!</p> \n      <p><b>Mechanic</b>: If\
  \ you caught me on the recent <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/officialpaizo\">Starfinder\
  \ Wednesday Twitch stream</a>, you’ll know I’m a fan of powered armor in Starfinder.\
  \ I’m also a big fan of the mechanic class, so I was overjoyed to see an alternative\
  \ to the artificial intelligence class feature called experimental prototype. Your\
  \ mechanic chooses either to develop an experimental weapon prototype or an experimental\
  \ armor prototype, and let me tell you: the armor is damn cool. In addition to gaining\
  \ heavy armor proficiency, your mechanic is able to fit extra upgrades into their\
  \ suit, reprogram the armor on the fly to better defend against specific foes, and\
  \ at most levels rebuild the armor into a higher-level version of itself. At 5th\
  \ level, your mechanic automatically becomes proficient in powered armor, and your\
  \ mechanic can transform their armor prototype into powered armor. At higher levels,\
  \ your mechanic can start adding great powers like flight and energy shields.</p>\

  \ by Mirco Paganessi</p> \n      </div> \n      <p><b>Mystic</b>: If you’re like\
  \ me, you adore many of the mystic connections but often see one of the connection\
  \ powers and say “Hmmm, I see how that appeals to some folks, but that’s just not\
  \ what my character wants.” What if you could shop around for new connection powers\
  \ on a case-by-case basis? Enter epiphanies, a new mystic option that provides a\
  \ host of universal connection powers that anyone can take in place of one of their\
  \ connection’s current powers. Would you rather your akashic mystic gain the mystic\
  \ reach epiphany in place of her peer Into the future connection power, extending\
  \ the range of their spells by casting them as full actions? Maybe your star shaman\
  \ wants to branch out by picking up a second connection in place of their starlight\
  \ form power? Or are you like me and just want to give a mindbreaker mystic the\
  \ 1st-level epiphany called wrecking fists, letting them punch anything that has\
  \ the gall to be immune to mind-affecting effects? Now you can!</p> \n      <div\

  \ \n      <p><b>Operative</b>: A large portion of the operative’s options involve\
  \ a really fun alternative to trick attack called stunt and strike, and while I’\
  m excited for you to explore that on you own, I want to call out a delightful alternative\
  \ to the operative’s fast movement ability: quick cover. Why run when you can hide?\
  \ You’re able to upgrade the degree of cover your character is gaining from the\
  \ environment, with tiny impediments that would grant no bonus giving partial cover\
  \ (“I take cover behind the toaster. No, really.”), and gain cover from whatever\
  \ would provide just partial cover. I really enjoy manipulating an encounter’s environment\
  \ with improvised weapons, cover, and other tricks, so this ability’s right up my\
  \ alley.</p> \n      <p><b>Solarian</b>: The <i>Character Operations Manual</i>\
  \ introduces shields, which the new vanguard class wields admirably. But why should\
  \ vanguards get all the fun? What if instead of manifesting a photon-axe or solar\
  \ armor your character could instead generate an energy shield that boosts your\
  \ AC? What if I also told you that you can slap people with your energy shield to\
  \ make an unarmed strike? What if you could slap a solarion weapon crystal into\
  \ your character’s shield to change the type of damage that the unarmed shield slams\
  \ deal? What if I stopped asking leading questions and just got to the point? The\
  \ solar shield solarian is really cool! And if you can stand to wait until this\
  \ book hits shelves, you can also read up on the long-anticipated solar flare solarian\
  \ option that can fire ranged energy bursts!</p> \n      <p><b>Soldier</b>: Do you\
  \ ever run into a character option that suddenly inspires a whole character concept\
  \ and spurs a frantic rush to research all of the other options that could potentially\
  \ contribute to that character’s new schtick? I know I do, and I’ve been through\
  \ that at least three different times when finding a playable alien that has the\
  \ natural attack racial trait. Like, do I want my vesk to tear limbs from her foes\
  \ as the rest of the group watches with a mix of horror and envy? Darn right I do.\
  \ And now others can enjoy that same fascination thanks to the ascetic warrior option\
  \ that exchanges your character’s heavy armor and heavy weapons proficiency in order\
  \ to deliver devastating unarmed strikes. And if your soldier already had the natural\
  \ attacks ability, you can instead add weapon special properties to their strikes,\
  \ such as block, grapple, or stun. If you’re excited about unarmed prowess, you\
  \ might also like some of the new feat boosts—those are special gear boosts that\
  \ modify specific combat feats your character might have grabbed. I really like\
  \ grabbing strike (modifies Improved Combat Maneuver [Grapple]), which lets you\
  \ automatically grapple a foe after you use an unarmed strike against them and beat\
  \ the target’s KAC by 8 or more.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\

  \ those who love casting spells, the technomancer’s spell cache gives you all the\
  \ power you need to fuel your character’s technological mischief. But for me, the\
  \ ideal technomancer lives for cybernetic augmentations, slowly transforming into\
  \ someone who’s as much machine as mortal. That’s why I’m so excited for the cache\
  \ augmentation, a new option that replaces spell cache and cache capacitor with\
  \ a cybernetic or magitech augmentation that evolves as your character gains levels.\
  \ Plus, at higher levels, every time your technomancer prepares for the day, they\
  \ can configure their augmentation to boost their choice of Reflex saves, Fortitude\
  \ saves, attack rolls, or key skill checks.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
