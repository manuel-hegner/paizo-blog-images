  ></span></a> \n   <h1 itemprop=\"headline\">Proper Villains</h1> \n   <p>by Erik\
  \ Scott de Bie</p> \n   <h2>Chapter Four: The Reward</h2> \n   <div itemprop=\"\
  articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">He awoke in a cold spray\
  \ of brackish water. The Hellknight who'd roused him drew back the half-empty bucket,\
  \ then brought it forward again for another go. This time, Tarrant inhaled half\
  \ the putrid stuff and gagged. \"Is that really necessary?\" he coughed.</span></p>\
  \ \n    <p>The Hellknight leaned close, his breath turning Tarrant's stomach. \"\
  You stink of fear, Liespinner.\" </p> \n    <p>\"And you stink of mediocrity,\"\
  \ Tarrant said. \"I prefer my smell, thanks.\"</p> \n    <p>The knight kicked him\
  \ in the stomach, and Tarrant collapsed to the floor. The pain was bad, but at least\
  \ he had earned the freedom to inspect his surroundings. He was still in Hawkthorne\
  \ Tower—up in the council chambers where Doreset sometimes held formal events. The\
  \ second Hellknight stood a little ways off, clutching both Tarrant's sheathed rapier\
  \ and the bottomless red silk bag. Evidence, no doubt. Beyond the Hellknights stood\
  \ a circle of Blackscale Blades, their expressions grim. </p> \n    <p>Tarrant saw\
  \ Gislai first, manacled and bruised. Her illusion had fallen, revealing her natural\
  \ half-orc features. She glared at Tarrant with a mixture of concern and contempt.\
  \ She had, after all, told him so.</p> \n    <p>Ephere was there as well. She'd\
  \ shed her fine emerald gown for black working leathers that left her brand uncovered,\
  \ and she fit in well amongst the Chelaxians. She averted her gaze from Tarrant,\
  \ like the aloof and serene elf maiden she had first seemed to be. He'd always been\
  \ a fool for a pretty face.</p> \n    <p>The Hellknight kicked Tarrant again, and\
  \ Gislai cried out. \"Stop it!\"</p> \n    <p>Her captor slapped her hard enough\
  \ to make her stagger into Ephere, who shoved her back with one arm. </p> \n   \
  \ <p>It wasn't supposed to go this way. Only Tarrant was supposed to suffer for\
  \ his mistakes, not his friends.</p> \n    <p>The Hellknight drew back his fist\
  \ for another punch.</p> \n    <p>\"Enough.\" A severe woman with long blonde hair\
  \ and her own set of fiendish Hellknight armor stepped through the circle of judgment.\
  \ She clicked the talons of her right-hand gauntlet together and looked down at\
  \ Tarrant with the sort of expression wolves reserve for wounded deer. \"Leave him\
  \ to me.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Altara,\" Tarrant said. \"Charmed, as always.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>She kicked at his face with her steel-shod boot, but instinct let him dodge\
  \ aside enough to save his neck from snapping. The boot crushed his nose and sent\
  \ him rolling over and over until he slammed into the legs of his Hellknight captor.\
  \ There he lay coughing as the world spun.</p> \n    <p>Of the many women he'd loved\
  \ and left in his wake, Altara Hathran had been his first—and consistently worst—\
  oversight. He'd made her promises when they were young together, never dreaming\
  \ that he would disappoint her, or that his betrayal would lead her to the life\
  \ of a militant ascetic. He regretted it all bitterly, almost as much as his broken\
  \ nose. </p> \n    <p>He heard familiar laughter, and turned his woozy focus to\
  \ a massive man reclining on a divan a few paces away. \"Ah, my <i>trusted</i> friend.\"\
  \ Lord Doreset's prodigious bulk quivered under his words. \"It pleases my heart\
  \ to see you again, so... helpless.\"</p> \n    <p>His presence answered all Tarrant's\
  \ questions. How long had he been in league with the Hellknights? How long had they\
  \ planned this ambush? It didn't matter.</p> \n    <p>\"Your plan has failed,\"\
  \ Altara said. \"We will find your other friends soon enough—if they haven't fled\
  \ already.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Aye, that sounds like Eram.\" </p> \n    <p>\"Still\
  \ a jester.\" Altara thrust the talons of her gauntlet through Tarrant's mail tunic\
  \ and into his shoulder, then lifted him to his feet. Tarrant gasped for breath\
  \ and bloody stars burst at the edges of his vision. She fanned out the sharpened\
  \ fingers of her other hand on his face and sneered at him. \"It's over, Tarrant\
  \ Liespinner. Your crimes will finally see justice. Have you anything to say for\
  \ yourself?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Did—\" he muttered. \"Did you look... in the bag?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Altara leaned closer. \"What?\"</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Altara.jpg\"><img src=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Altara_360.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n   \
  \  <br> Altara took the breakup badly.\n    </div> \n    <p>\"I see you... haven't\
  \ returned the treasure,\" Tarrant said, getting his breath back. \"I expect that's\
  \ because it's evidence. Have you checked it yet?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Very well,\"\
  \ Altara said. \"You wish to have this crime punished now? So be it.\" She let Tarrant\
  \ slump to the floor, flicked his blood off her claw, and waved her Hellknight to\
  \ open the red silk bag. \"Should I look for something in particular?\"</p> \n \
  \   <p>\"At the bottom.\" Tarrant didn't dare sing a song of healing, but surreptitiously\
  \ pressed his wound to staunch the bleeding. \"You wouldn't want to drop any of\
  \ it, though.\"</p> \n    <p>Altara reached carefully into the bag, which swallowed\
  \ up her arm. She drew out handfuls of treasure, but had nowhere to put it. One\
  \ of the Blackscales came forward with another obviously enchanted haversack, and\
  \ Altara shoveled handful after handful of jewels and hard coin from the bag into\
  \ the pack. Lord Doreset chuckled in the background.</p> \n    <p>\"This is a mountain\
  \ of evidence,\" Altara said. </p> \n    <p>\"True,\" Tarrant said.</p> \n    <p>Finally,\
  \ Altara reached the bottom of the haul and pulled out a book wrapped in black leather.\
  \ She peered at it.</p> \n    <p>\"Wait,\" Lord Doreset said, his voice soft. \"\
  What is that—?\"</p> \n    <p>\"More evidence,\" Tarrant said.</p> \n    <p>Altara\
  \ unwrapped the twine that held the book shut and flipped through the pages. \"\
  Names, dates, amounts,\" she said. \"This is a ledger. And—\" She looked at the\
  \ writing carefully. \"This is not your writing, Akayn.\"</p> \n    <p>\"No, it\
  \ is not,\" Tarrant said. \"My lady.\"</p> \n    <p>She scrutinized the book anew,\
  \ with the eye of a judge—which, of course, she was. Whatever grudge Altara might\
  \ have against Tarrant, she remained an agent of the law. \"This is your hand, Lord\
  \ Doreset,\" she said. </p> \n    <p>\"I've never seen that before!\" Lord Doreset\
  \ huffed.</p> \n    <p>\"You mean you haven't seen it <i>recently</i>,\" Tarrant\
  \ said. \"How could you, when I had stolen it?\" he turned back to Altara. \"I think\
  \ you'll find that to be an account of all House Doreset's illegal dealings, from\
  \ tax evasion to swindling merchants in Cheliax to selling chattel to necromancers\
  \ in Geb. Also records of embezzlement—oh.\" He glanced at the assembled soldiers.\
  \ \"Including the thousands of gold sails he embezzled from the Blackscale Blades,\
  \ while supposedly acting as their patron.\"</p> \n    <p>A cold murmur passed through\
  \ the room. Doreset's face went red. \"This—this is a trick!\" he declared. \"A\
  \ forgery!\"</p> \n    <p>\"Subject it to whatever tests you want,\" Tarrant said.\
  \ \"As I fancy you shall.\"</p> \n    <p>Two burly Blackscale officers moved forward\
  \ and took Doreset away, no doubt to conduct their own investigation. A third approached\
  \ Altara and motioned toward the ledger. </p> \n    <p>\"See that it's not damaged,\"\
  \ she said, and handed it to him. \"My knights will be conducting their own investigation\
  \ as well.\" The officer nodded in thanks, then left as well, taking the rest of\
  \ the Blackscales with him.</p> \n    <p>Through it all, Altara watched Tarrant\
  \ suspiciously. \"What was this about?\" she asked finally. \"You'd do all this—\
  sacrifice your winnings and yourself—just to bury Doreset?\"</p> \n    <p>\"You\
  \ uphold justice in your way, I do it in mine.\" Tarrant coughed raggedly and looked\
  \ at Altara. \"Justice is done, my lady. Would you unbind me, please? Oops.\" He\
  \ let the open manacles dangle from one hand. \"Looks as though I took care of that.\
  \ I'll just be going—\"</p> \n    <p>\"No,\" Altara said.</p> \n    <p>The Hellknights\
  \ drew their swords. Tarrant shivered.</p> \n    <p>\"Lord Doreset's accounts will\
  \ be settled,\" Altara said. \"Fear not on that account. But you and I are far from\
  \ finished.\" She took hold of his armored shirt and pulled him up to eye level.\
  \ \"What's your plan for dealing with me, Tarrant Liespinner? How are you going\
  \ to walk out of here?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Altara, love of my heart.\" Tarrant gave\
  \ her a winning smile. \"Who said I wanted to leave?\" He hummed a sweet melody,\
  \ which in his mind's eye took the form of floating flower petals around them.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Slowly, Altara's expression softened. She was different now—hardened,\
  \ honed. But underneath the armor, he could still see the lovely young woman he\
  \ had known in Cheliax. \"Oh, Tarrant.\" Altara loosened her grasp on his tunic.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>That was all he needed to slip from her clutches and step away. \"I'll\
  \ just be going then.\"</p> \n    <p>Altara hesitated a second, confused, then her\
  \ face darkened. She tried to grab for him, but he'd manacled her wrists. \"Seize\
  \ him!\" she roared.</p> \n    <p>Her two Hellknights stepped forward, but one jerked\
  \ spasmodically and toppled to the floor. The other looked around into the flame\
  \ of a burning fist held up to his face. Ephere stepped protectively between them\
  \ and Tarrant.</p> \n    <p>\"Well done,\" Tarrant said, putting his arm around\
  \ her for support.</p> \n    <p>The elf nodded, keeping her fists up.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>\"What treachery is this?\" Altara demanded.</p> \n    <p>\"A thousand apologies,\"\
  \ Tarrant said. \"Did you think that night at the Open Palm was our first meeting?\
  \ Lady Ephere and I are old friends. I can't imagine why you thought otherwise.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"What—what of the mark?\" Altara pointed her chin at Ephere's chest.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"A slave brand,\" Ephere said. \"Tarrant was the one who saved me.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Understandably, she holds little love for Cheliax,\" Tarrant added.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"You were playing us from the beginning!\" Altara said.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Indeed.\" Tarrant looked to Gislai. \"Coming?\"</p> \n    <p>The half-orc—who looked\
  \ as shocked as Altara—nodded. She twisted free of her captor and headbutted him\
  \ in the face. He joined his compatriot on the ground. \"You could have told me,\
  \ you know,\" she observed.</p> \n    <p>\"And spoil the fun? Hardly.\" Tarrant\
  \ undid her manacles. \"And thank Calistria we're no longer in the vault. Your ring,\
  \ if you please?\" </p> \n    <p>Gislai turned her ring around her finger, and a\
  \ shimmering light appeared around the three thieves.</p> \n    <p>Still manacled,\
  \ Altara glared at them. \"This is not over, Liespinner.\"</p> \n    <p>He blew\
  \ her a kiss. \"Love, I would have it no other way.\"</p> \n    <p align=\"center\"\
  >∗∗∗</p> \n    <p> Later, at the Open Palm, Gorm was all smiles as they shared one\
  \ last drink. Gislai and Ephere were seated nearby, talking of all things elven.\
  \ Now that all was revealed, they had become fast friends. Tarrant couldn't say\
  \ whether that boded well or ill. </p> \n    <p>\"Really?\" Gorm asked. \"They just\
  \ took Lord Doreset away like that?\"</p> \n    <p>\"As I expected. Perhaps the\
  \ proper authorities will even get to lock him up afterward. If there's anything\
  \ left.\" Tarrant winced as he dabbed a damp cloth at his nose. Gislai's prayers\
  \ had healed it, but it still felt uneven. \"That squares your debt, then?\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Yes, but you—\" Gorm shook his head. \"You've given much for me: almost\
  \ got thrown into prison again or worse, lost your magic bag and any reward, and\
  \ only brought the Hellknights down on you all the harder. You'll have to leave\
  \ Absalom. Come to think of it, why haven't you left yet? I'm glad to drink with\
  \ you, but—\"</p> \n    <p>Tarrant shrugged, unconcerned. \"I hear Korvosa is nice\
  \ this time of year—and that its women are fiery. Besides, who spoke of loss?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>At that moment, two Blackscales entered. Ephere raised her gauntlets\
  \ and Gislai pulled out several shuriken, but the adventurers' forms shimmered as\
  \ the magic of their potions wore off. Eram and Arlif looked none the worse for\
  \ wear. The halfling walked sullenly to Tarrant's side. </p> \n    <p>\"You might\
  \ have trusted me,\" Eram said. \"And not sent this mute giant with me.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"And you might have fled town.\" Tarrant took the haversack from Eram.\
  \ \"Fled before splitting shares, that is.\"</p> \n    <p>He opened the bag to reveal\
  \ gleaming treasure: their haul from the bait and switch.</p> \n    <p>\"Now it's\
  \ time to go,\" Tarrant said. \"The road beckons, and greater villainy awaits.\"\
