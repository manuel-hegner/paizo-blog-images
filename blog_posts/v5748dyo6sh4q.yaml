  \ in this blog, but they are ahead, so proceed accordingly.) </p> \n     <p><i>The\
  \ Show Must Go On</i> is a Pathfinder Second Edition adventure for four 1st-level\
  \ characters. This adventure begins the Extinction Curse Adventure Path, a six-part,\
  \ monthly campaign in which the heroes lead a traveling circus as they unravel a\
  \ plot to eradicate all life from the Starstone Isles at the heart of the Inner\
  \ Sea. The adventure also includes advice on how to run a traveling circus, new\
  \ circus-themed rules, and a menagerie of monsters both wondrous and wicked.</p>\

  ><i>Extinction Curse Player’s Guide</i></a> by Ron Lundeen provided six new backgrounds—\
  the aerialist, animal wrangler, barker, blow-in, butcher (not what you might think),\

  \ on the isles of Erran and Kortos.</p> \n     <p>But a Pathfinder Adventure Path\
  \ is more than just an exciting plot written by a collection of the best authors\
  \ in the industry. It also includes new rules, stats, and support articles to give\
  \ Game Masters additional material to expand their campaign. So let’s start to shine\

  \" width=\"50%/\"></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>A circus can now be added to any Pathfinder\
  \ game. You can start by using the <i>Life in the Circus</i> article by Patrick\
  \ Renie. Here’s an excerpt:</p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p>“The smell of animals,\
  \ incense, and burning pitch fills the air. Murmurs of excitement punctuate the\
  \ dark, open space. From outside, silver light cast by a crescent moon slices through\
  \ the tent’s entryway. Suddenly, music bursts in from all sides. The curtain rises,\
  \ spotlights flood the ring in the middle of the tent, and a lone figure standing\
  \ in the center spurs the crowd’s cacophonous applause. “Welcome, welcome!” the\
  \ figure booms. “Welcome to the greatest show on Golarion!”</p> \n      <p>At the\
  \ start of this adventure, the PCs inherit the Circus of Wayward Wonders, and they’\
  re thrust into the roles of showrunners in addition to their responsibilities as\
  \ adventurers. Throughout the Extinction Curse Adventure Path, the PCs will travel\
  \ all over the Isle of Erran and the Isle of Kortos, undertaking a grand adventure\
  \ to save the land from an ancient evil. Thankfully, it’s not all dire omens and\
  \ life-or-death circumstances—during their off time, the PCs can unwind by running\
  \ a joyous circus where the worst case scenario is a comically clumsy show. To ensure\
  \ their circus is a success, the PCs will need to promote, orchestrate, and execute\
  \ fantastic shows in towns big and small.</p> \n      <p>The rules in this article\
  \ are designed to give the PCs agency over their circus and approximate the fun\
  \ and responsibility of running a traveling troupe of entertainers. While intended\
  \ for use throughout the Extinction Curse Adventure Path, the rules are flexible\
  \ enough to be used in any campaign...”</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>For more\
  \ rules and guidance on running a circus, preparing for the show, putting on a show,\

  \ your circus to vivid life with a million dreams and the <i>Adventure Toolbox</i>\
  \ by Andrew Mullen, Patrick Renie, David N. Ross, and Michael Sayre. This includes\
  \ two new uncommon player archetypes—the juggler and staff acrobat, the juggle skill\
  \ feat, five nature snares—like dust pods, seven circus weapons—like the scorpion\
  \ whip, eight environment spells—like personal rain cloud, and new nine monsters.\
  \ In fact, we can name a few of the monsters without spoilers—the bone croupier,\
  \ flea, living graffiti, and luminous ooze—because they are not used in <i>The Show\
  \ Must Go On</i>. There are also two unique foes that are fully detailed with two\
  \ pages each. All of these new materials can be dropped into your Age of Lost Omens\
  \ or homebrew games and are available in print or PDF.</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  ><i>Core Rulebook</i></a>. Many of these new materials are uncommon—meaning available\
  \ only to those who have special training, grew up in a certain culture, or come\
  \ from a particular part of the world. As we just learned from the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01zq7?Pathfinder-Gamemastery-Guide\"\

  \ PC can usually find them eventually with enough effort, potentially by choosing\
  \ a specific character option or spending substantial downtime tracking them down.”\
  </p> \n     <p>We release Pathfinder Adventure Paths monthly in six-volume arcs,\
  \ meaning each year sees the release of two complete Adventure Path campaigns. You\
  \ can acquire them at your <a href=\"https://paizo.com/paizo/locator\">favorite\
  \ local gaming store</a>. Or with your ongoing <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy7xpn?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-Subscription\"\
  >Pathfinder Adventure Path subscription</a>, we'll send you each new Pathfinder\
  \ Adventure Path volume and charge your payment method automatically as we ship\
  \ each product. You only need to sign up once, and never need to worry about renewal\
  \ notice or missed products.</p> \n     <p>Next, we will look inside volume two,\
