  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p><a href=\"/products/btpy9j6p\"><em>Ultimate Intrigue</em></a>\
  \ has plenty of feats, spells, and magic items that help your character get herself\
  \ into all sorts of troubleâ€”and out of trouble as well!</p> \n    <p itemprop=\"\
  description\">The Brilliant Planner feat lets you make a fund that you can use to\
  \ pull out the item or resource you need in a particular situation, which can be\
  \ pretty useful in clutch situations. The fighter gains several new combat feats\
  \ that enhance his bravery (both against all mind-affecting effects and against\
  \ social attacks like feint and demoralize) and even allow him to share his bravery\
  \ with nearby allies. Legendary influence lets mediums choose one feat for each\
  \ legend and accept influence to gain the feat they chose when they channel that\
  \ legend (so you can pick things that only help you with one legend, like Selective\
  \ Channel for hierophant, which has channel, Arcane Armor Training for archmage,\
  \ and so on). Feats like Subtle Enchantments are great for manipulating others (in\
  \ this case, it makes it harder to notice the target is enchanted with Sense Motive\
  \ and gives a 50% that a target who succeeds on the save doesn't notice it had to\
  \ make a Will save). The three new styles are Fox Style, which lets high-Int characters\
  \ master feinting, dirty tricks, and the like, Owl Style allows martial characters\
  \ to use their fighting skill to maneuver around the battlefield fluidly, and Street\
  \ Style lets urban characters create combo attacks using the environment around\
  \ them. And that's just a few of the feats you'll find in the book!</p> \n    <p>On\
  \ to spells: Intrigue spells in general lend themselves to sneaky and clever usage,\
  \ but there's plenty of choices for all sorts of characters, even the most straightforward\
  \ ones. One of the cool new things for spells is the ruse descriptor, which allows\
  \ you to cast a spell that seems to be another spell unless the person identifying\
  \ it succeeds by 10 or more. Things like the <i>false resurrection</i> spells, where\
  \ you pretend to bring someone back to life but actually revive the body with a\
  \ possessing demon or devil inside, <i>hollow heroism</i>, which works as normal\
  \ for a while, but then you can change the effect from +2 to -4 at any time, and\
  \ <i>treacherous teleport</i> where you send the other passengers of the <i>teleport</i>\
  \ somewhere different than where you go. The <i>entice fey</i> spells allow you\
  \ to bargain with fey and potentially earn their service and <i>conditional favor</i>\
  \ lets you call take-backs on a beneficial spell you cast, so you could say \"Sure,\
  \ I'll cast this spell and remove your blindness, but only as long as you promise\
  \ to follow the paladin code.\" There's all sorts of other fun measures and countermeasures\
  \ in the spells so that PCs and their foes can escalate things like reconnaissance\
  \ and counter-reconnaissance, and then there's such fun spells to show off the bling\
  \ of your magic, like <i>resplendent mansion</i>, which creates an actual mansion\
  \ on a flat area that last for weeks!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n  \

  \ Molnar</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>Finally, items: There's a variety of fun nonmagical\
  \ intrigue items like a book with a hollow compartment in it and a wrist-launcher\
  \ that shoots darts, as well as some suggestions of some top tools of the trade\
  \ from <a href=\"/products/btpy8tmc\"><em>Ultimate Equipment</em></a>. Some of the\
  \ cool magic items include a shield that can pick a lock for you while you stand\
  \ by the door fighting with your other hand, a weapon property that makes your weapon\
  \ invisible, an armor that lets you redirect divinations meant for someone else\
  \ to yourself, an erasable book that appears innocuous but secretly records everything\
  \ people say around it, a pouch that erases the writing within it if anyone else\
  \ tries to open it, a deck of cards with various doors on them that turn into doors\
  \ when you put them on a wall, and the <i>quick-change mask</i>, a consumable that\
  \ lets a vigilante instantly switch identities in a tight spot, and that's just\
  \ a few of them.</p> \n    <p>Next week I'll cover the various special subsystem\
  \ in <a href=\"/products/btpy9j6p\"><em>Ultimate Intrigue</em></a>, like verbal\
  \ duels and influence, so be sure to keep a careful eye out; the blog might be plotting\
  \ a heist to nab your prized McGuffin while you read it!</p> \n    <p>Mark Seifter<br>\
