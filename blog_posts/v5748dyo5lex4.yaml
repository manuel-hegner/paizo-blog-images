  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Ari Marmell</p> \n   <h2>Chapter One: Echoes of the Past</h2>\
  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">Rattling\
  \ shutters and gaps between the wooden slats of walls allowed a faint breeze into\
  \ the store. The establishment smelled of dust, mildew, and the acrid aroma of burning\
  \ leaves that kept the ubiquitous mosquitoes and flies from riding the weather inside.\
  \ It wasn't that much of a store, all in all; but then, it wasn't that much of a\
  \ town, either.</span></p> \n    <p>The bulk of the voices—and there were always\
  \ voices, despite the store's ramshackle appearance—wafted from the counter opposite\
  \ the door, and from the racks of meats and baked goods alongside. Ellithir allowed\
  \ the locals to loiter, picking at the foods and paying for whatever they consumed,\
  \ rather than insisting they buy in bulk. Just another way to compete with the eateries\
  \ and taverns in town—all two of them. Even over the sounds of those voices, though,\
  \ the willowy elf heard rickety floorboards beneath a hesitant tread, and the faint\
  \ rustling and thumping of someone browsing idly through the aisles of various tools.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The visitor eventually emerged from the second aisle over, between haphazard\
  \ coils of hempen rope and a portcullis of dangling rakes. Beneath a mop of unruly\
  \ red hair, Khydol's face was morose. The gold-hued tunic he normally favored was\
  \ hidden by a cloak and mantle of drab brown—as was the holy pendant he usually\
  \ wore exposed for all to see.</p> \n    <p>Gracefully, her own steps squeezing\
  \ nary a squeak from the floorboards, Ellithir stepped from behind the other counter—\
  the one where she normally tallied up purchases—and produced a three-legged stool\
  \ for her guest.</p> \n    <p>\"Thank you.\" Clearly a response born solely of instinct;\
  \ his eyes hadn't even focused on her. Ellithir studied him further: the abnormal\
  \ garb, the pensive gaze, the faintly pointed ears indicating that he shared a portion\
  \ of her own racial heritage.</p> \n    <p>Studied him, and waited for him to come\
  \ to it in his own time.</p> \n    <p>\"It's done,\" he said finally.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>She nodded. She'd expected as much. \"And this troubles you?\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  It...\" he shrugged. \"Yes. Somewhat. It's just... a lot to take on.\"</p> \n  \
  \  <p>\"I know it is.\" She reached out, gripping his shoulder tight. \"We've talked\
  \ about this, Khydol. You're doing the right thing. Look at what <i>else</i> is\
  \ happening over there! Hail, in <i>this</i> season? Wilting crops? If the gods\
  \ are finally showing their wrath at those apostates, surely <i>your</i> anger is\
  \ justified!\" It was an old discussion, one they'd held half a dozen times before.\
  \ Khydol agreed with her, she knew that; he just had to be reminded.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  And besides,\" Ellithir continued, jabbing a finger at the half-elf's unseen holy\
  \ icon, \"what else would she ask of you but vengeance?\"</p> \n    <p>Reverentially,\
  \ Khydol reached beneath the woolen mantle and withdrew the heavy pendant. There,\
  \ worked into the silver, were the triple daggers of the Savored Sting: Calistria,\
  \ mistress of lust, deception... and retribution.</p> \n    <p>\"The goddess be\
  \ praised,\" Khydol murmured, softly but sincerely. Across the store, the voices\
  \ began to taper off as men and women glanced out the windows, saw the first streamers\
  \ of smoke writhing from over the horizon—and over the border.</p> \n    <p>\"The\
  \ goddess be praised,\" Ellithir echoed, her thin lips quirked in the faintest of\
  \ smiles.</p> \n    <p align=\"center\">∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\"\

  \    </div> \n    <p>In some taverns, a brawl means something has gone very wrong,\
  \ and it's time to yell for the watch. In others, it just means that sailors are\
  \ in port, or teamsters are between deliveries, and someone's imbibed a bit too\
  \ freely.</p> \n    <p>And then there are those in which a brawl simply means \"\
  We're open.\"</p> \n    <p>The stranger—one of many—slouched in a rickety chair,\
  \ trying to absorb the last dregs of warmth from the hearth's dying embers, and\
  \ watched with profound disinterest as the last of this evening's rowdies were hurled\
  \ out the door by the husband-and-wife team of half-orc bouncers. The fight hadn't\
  \ even been fun to watch; those killjoy bouncers had stepped in too early.</p> \n\
  \    <p>He couldn't be bothered to remember the tavern's name. The latest in an\
  \ endless line, tracing a pathway of pain across the Inner Sea, it was nothing to\
  \ him but another place to drink, and maybe chase a few hours' slumber. It wasn't\
  \ even a good place; that damn insect-repelling herbal smoke that had recently grown\
  \ so popular throughout the River Kingdoms was giving him a headache.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>Not that Marcov Draeven appeared any more special than the shabby ale hall.\
  \ Grease-matted hair that might, if clean, have appeared a rich brown hung past\
  \ his shoulders in ragged strings. Unshaven cheeks went beyond gaunt into sunken,\
  \ and red-rimmed, deep-set eyes suggested many recent sleepless nights. An old and\
  \ often-patched chain hauberk left rust stains on a tunic <i>almost</i> too dark\
  \ to show them. Only his weapon, a monster of a hand-and-a-half sword, demonstrated\
  \ any signs of care. It currently leaned against the wall, unscabbarded, like any\
  \ old walking stick.</p> \n    <p>Any of the patrons who noticed him at all—and\
  \ if they did, it was only for that naked blade—had certainly dismissed him as just\
  \ another sellsword, gone somewhat to seed, haunted by past years.</p> \n    <p>They\
  \ had <i>no idea</i> how right they were.</p> \n    <p>To those potential observers,\
  \ it would surely have seemed just another drunken mishap as fingers fumbled and\
  \ lost their grip. They might have chuckled as the mug toppled and bounced across\
  \ the floor, leaving tiny chips to mingle with the layers of broken crockery that\
  \ served as the tavern's carpet.</p> \n    <p>Only Marcov himself knew that he'd\
  \ placed the damn thing solidly on the table, that his hand was a good four or five\
  \ inches away when it had suddenly gone skidding over the edge.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Pharasma take you!\" His low growl was surely inaudible to any nearby ears. \"Leave\
  \ me <i>alone</i>! Just one evening, damn you...\"</p> \n    <p>His sword wobbled\
  \ against the wall, threatening to tilt.</p> \n    <p>Spitting curses, Marcov stumbled\
  \ a few steps from the chair—not drunk, entirely, but not precisely sober either—\
  and dropped to one knee, hand outstretched to retrieve the fallen tankard.</p> \n\
  \    <p>That lean brought him just near enough to the next table to overhear the\
  \ conversation over the ambient cacophony. Which, he realized sourly, had been the\
  \ entire point.</p> \n    <p><i>Their</i> entire point.</p> \n    <p>\"...third\
  \ town in as many weeks!\"</p> \n    <p>\"Bandits, maybe? Been a rough harvest.\
  \ Lots of folks goin' hungry over there.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Bandits <i>steal</i>,\
  \ ya idiot. Kill a few; rape some, maybe. What kinda bandits burn whole towns to\
  \ the ground?\"</p> \n    <p>\"I dunno. Angry ones?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Idiot.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Yer <i>both</i> idiots. It's divine vengeance, it is. Knew it was comin'\
  \ to 'em sooner or later.\"</p> \n    <p>\"No!\" Marcov hissed as he rose, wayward\
  \ flagon forgotten. \"Not my business. Not my problem!\"</p> \n    <p>The mug at\
  \ his feet shattered as though crushed beneath an unseen heel. His sword against\
  \ the wall, and the chair he'd so recently vacated, began to rock.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  <i>No</i>, gods damn you!\" He already had a goal, had somewhere to be! Why wouldn't\
  \ they just—?</p> \n    <p>The chair toppled, one leg snapping loose. The embers\
  \ in the fireplace burst upward, then extinguished themselves in a sizzling, sifting\
  \ rain of ash.</p> \n    <p>And the howling began.</p> \n    <p>A single voice,\
  \ at first. Then a dozen... three dozen... a hundred... more. Shrieks of terror,\
  \ wails of despair, screams of agony, sobs of grief. The final gasps of the dying,\
  \ and the hopeless moans of the damned.</p> \n    <p>Nobody else heard them—Marcov\
  \ knew that all too well from prior experience—but that didn't make them any less\
  \ deafening to him! Once more he fell to his knees, hands clasped to his ears, eyes\
  \ squeezed so tightly shut that flickers of color flashed across his lids.</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"Stop it! <i>Stop it!</i> Leave me <i>alone!</i>\"</p> \n    <p>The howling\
  \ only grew louder. The sword fell, sliding across the hearth, quillons grating\
  \ on brick. Crockery atop the surrounding tables began to shake and clatter.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Strong-willed, stubborn, and prideful was Marcov Draeven. Even in the\
  \ face of the unnatural onslaught, the gale of angry souls, it took him nearly a\
  \ full minute to bend.</p> \n    <p>\"All right! All right, you bastards, enough!\"\
  \ The sellsword's hands dropped from his ears to the floor, where he crouched like\
  \ a wounded animal. \"Enough,\" he repeated, far more softly.</p> \n    <p>The howling\
  \ stopped. The surrounding objects ceased their impossible dance. And Marcov opened\
  \ his eyes.</p> \n    <p>The room around him had changed, and not just by the will\
  \ of the dead. Chairs and tables lay strewn where patrons had bolted to their feet\
  \ and retreated from the spectral maelstrom. Quite a few had fled, to judge by the\
  \ gaping door (and, in a some instances, windows). Most of those who remained stood,\
  \ wide-eyed and sweating, pressed against the farthest walls, but a few edged forward,\
  \ hands reaching for weapons.</p> \n    <p>Marcov slowly rose, stretched out his\
  \ hand, and hissed something at his phantasmal retinue. The broad-bladed bastard\
  \ sword flew from its spot by the hearth to land in his waiting palm with a muted\
  \ slap.</p> \n    <p>The bravery rushed out of those few courageous souls, along\
  \ with gasps and muted shrieks. They, too, fell back against the walls once more.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Marcov needed only a moment to find one of the men on whose conversation\
  \ he had eavesdropped. \"The towns you were talking about—where are they?\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"I... That... Towns? Sir, I don't want any—\"</p> \n    <p>\"Where.\
  \ <i>Are.</i> They?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Touvette!\" It was scarcely a squeak. \"Eastern\
  \ Touvette!\"</p> \n    <p>A sharp nod, and then Marcov turned toward the shivering\
  \ barkeep. \"For the damages.\" He fumbled at his belt a moment before he found\
  \ his coin purse, not due to any lingering intoxication—Marcov was <i>quite</i>\
  \ sober now—but because his possessions had a bad habit of never remaining precisely\
  \ where he'd put them. Finally, he scooped out a handful of silver, which he casually\
  \ dropped to the floor when the barkeep showed no interest in coming anywhere near\
  \ him. Then, sword still unsheathed resting flat upon his shoulder, Marcov strode\
  \ toward the stables.</p> \n    <p align=\"center\">∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n    <p>The reinforced\
  \ leather of Loursa's armor absorbed the stroke that would otherwise have split\
  \ kidney and spine both. Still, she staggered a step across the churned and muddy\
  \ field before spinning around, whipping sweaty strands of hair from her face, and\
  \ slamming the heavy stock of the crossbow against the brigand's jaw. Something\
  \ cracked—bone or wood, she wasn't certain, but the man collapsed. Loursa took that\
  \ momentary respite to draw her own blade, catch a few deep breaths, and assess.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Kelbran hadn't been much better off than any of the other tiny communities\
  \ scattered near Touvette's easternmost borders. The unseasonable ice storms had\
  \ ravaged the settlement's crops as badly as its neighbors'; its people were just\
  \ as desperate, just as destitute. But when the invaders came, and the first of\
  \ the villages fell, Kelbran had welcomed survivors, rather than turning them away\
  \ to seek refuge elsewhere. It was a decision that Loursa and the other guards had\
  \ questioned when Samrev first made it, but the old village reeve had been adamant.\
  \ \"We have no charities in Kelbran to provide such services, as the great cities\
  \ do,\" he'd said, \"but we can <i>show</i> charity all the same.\" </p> \n    <p>He'd\
  \ had a practical motive as well, it turned out. When the invaders finally came\
  \ to Kelbran, the sixth community to suffer their depredations, Loursa and the other\
  \ guards had met them with a much larger force than they'd anticipated—a force made\
  \ up partly of refugees who, though starved and exhausted, burned with the need\
  \ to avenge their own lost homes. Nobody knew how these bandits had managed to avoid\
  \ the military patrols that scoured Touvette's major roads, but for the first time,\
  \ it looked as though they might not be unstoppable.</p> \n    <p>Still, Kelbran\
  \ had paid the price; Loursa wasn't sure, but she might well be the only guard left,\
  \ and at least a third of the townsfolk lay hacked and mutilated. The rest fought\
  \ in groups, overwhelming bandits alone or in pairs, making up in numbers and ferocity\
  \ what they lacked in equipment and training. Loursa again brushed sandy hair from\
  \ her face—she couldn't even remember when she'd lost her helmet—and hefted her\
  \ sword, ready to go and assist. As long as nothing else changed, victory was just\
  \ a matter of—</p> \n    <p>Everything disintegrated in a chorus of screams as the\
  \ first of the dead shambled over the nearby knolls.</p> \n    <p>They weren't many,\
  \ as compared to the townsfolk or bandits. But then, they didn't need to be. Dozens\
  \ of villagers broke and ran. Those that remained stood rooted in shock, if only\
  \ for an instant, and in that instant the invaders attacked with renewed vigor.\
  \ The walking corpses had turned the tide in favor of their living allies before\
  \ they'd even drawn near enough to strike.</p> \n    <p>The screaming only grew\
  \ louder—not merely in pain or in panic, though both were plentiful enough, but\
  \ in appalled recognition. Loursa's heart, already beating like a charging hound,\
  \ climbed into her throat as she recognized many of these creatures as the dead\
  \ citizens of other fallen towns.</p> \n    <p>The last few dozen survivors of Kelbran\
  \ found themselves in a chaotic mass, their homes behind them, bandits and the shambling\
  \ dead to all other sides. Loursa squeezed the hilt of her sword, struggling to\
  \ hold tight despite the patina of sweat, and prayed for a miracle. <i>Any</i> miracle.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Had she known what sort of miracle was coming, her prayers might have\
  \ been a bit more specific.</p> \n    <p><b>Coming Next Week</b>: A mysterious cult\
