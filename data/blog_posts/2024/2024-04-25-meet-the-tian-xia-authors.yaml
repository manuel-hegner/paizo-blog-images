              <h3>Eren Ahn (they/them primarily)</h3>
              <p>안녕하세요, 여러분! My name is Eren, and I had the incredibly fun opportunity to refresh Daikitsu and Lao Shu Po for the&nbsp;<em>Tian Xia World Guide</em>&nbsp;as well as contributing some lore around the mystical imugi. As someone who loves exploring the relationship between mortality and divinity, it was an absolute dream to have the opportunity to expand on Tian Xia's pantheon. I hope you all fall as deeply in love with the Lady of Foxes and Old Rat Woman as I did while writing them.</p>
              <p>You can find me sporadically talking about my writing on&nbsp;<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/erenahn.bsky.social">Bluesky</a>&nbsp;(by the time you're reading this, I'll have posted more detailed threads on my contributions for this book, if you're interested in reading about my process) and talking about everything else on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/chromathesia">Twitter</a>. You will also see me in a couple of months for the&nbsp;<em>Tian Xia Character Guide</em>!</p>
              <p><br></p>
              <h3>Alyx Bui</h3>
              <p>Hear ye, hear ye! Here come the imperial dragons of Tian Xia! I had the pleasure of crafting and writing on the Imperial Dragons and the peoples and land of Zi Ha! This was a massive collaboration between so many talented writers and artists—Basheer Ghouse to place Arindham, a forest dragon within the Valashmai Jungle, with Jay Zhang to place Luong Phung, a sea dragon within Xidao, with Jacky Leung to place Shen Ra, a sky dragon within Po Li, with Kevin Thien Vu Long Nguyen to place a sovereign dragon, Pham Duc Quan within Xa Hoi, and Grady Wang to place an underworld dragon, Zhu Long, within Chu Ye.</p>
              <p>For Zi Ha, it was brilliant to connect with Kienna Shaw, as we placed the samsaran peoples and their origins in this magical land. We wanted to make sure that we inserted a non-colonial view of this world. I wanted joy and wonder to come out of these harsh, wintery lands—from bioluminescent fungi and large, carnivorous plant hunting to festivals that honor the mountain peaks, dragon cycles, and the long day and night phases. Enjoy the epic lore of Shei Long, a Sky Dragon, and the moon deity Tsukiyo! Continue the conversation with me on X (Twitter)&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/daredevilalyx">@daredevilalyx</a>!</p>

              <h3>Banana Chan (she/they/he)</h3>
              <p>I'm Banana and I wrote a bunch of stuff for Tian Xia, but what I need EVERYONE to know about is the Great Flood, based on the creature Xiangliu. It's one of my favorite mythical creatures because of how silly it looks in drawings, but if you could see it in real life, it would probably be a body horror disaster. It has the body of a giant snake or eel with nine human heads attached to it. I'd been wanting to write about the Xiangliu for the longest time, so I'm extremely grateful that Paizo gave me that opportunity.</p>
              <p><br></p>
              <h3>Connie Chang (they/he/she)</h3>
              <p>Hey there! I'm Connie Chang, and I wrote Quain, a location full of wuxia fantasies, grandmasters, and cultivation! As a queer and trans diasporic Chinese person, I'm a huge fan of the wuxia and xianxia genres as a way to explore historical fantasy beyond western imaginations—so of course I jumped at the chance to help create something with Paizo. I'm especially interested in seeing the stories that will bloom from centuries-old, deeply complicated rivalries between grandmasters!</p>

              <h3>Hiromi Cota (they/them)</h3>
              <p>Hai tai! Wanne Hiromi yaibiin! Hi! I’m Hiromi! For folks unfamiliar with me, I’ve worked on over a hundred books and games, usually as a writer or game designer. I’m excited to have worked with Paizo, as I’ve wanted to for years. I’m even more excited to say that I also got to work on the&nbsp;<em>Tian Xia Character Guide</em>&nbsp;and pen the tie-in fiction&nbsp;<a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sii3?Tian-Xia-Days-The-Matsuri">The Matsuri</a>! Hopefully, I’ll have more opportunities to work with Paizo in the future. If I do, you’ll find out about them from my Bluesky account&nbsp;<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hiromicota.bsky.social">@hiromicota</a>!</p>
              <p>For the&nbsp;<em>Tian Xia World Guide</em>, I worked on Kwanlai. I had fun providing an in-world explanation as to why Kwanlai is principally populated by tengu (a Japanese creature) but has a Chinese name. The answer, in short, is colonialism. In real life, Japan colonized Uchinaa and foisted the exonym “Okinawa” upon my people. So, it was natural for me to depict the Lung Wa conquering the nation of Ootoya and foisting the exonym “Kwanlai” on the Ootoyans. Another fun tidbit in the writeup is takoyaki (battered and fried octopus) becoming a popular snack due to Wanshou (a nation ruled by a kraken) attacking Kwanlai.</p>

              <h3>Dana Ebert (she/her)</h3>
              <p>Dana Ebert (nonchalant female human writer) is a common author to find credited in Pathfinder publications, and the&nbsp;<em>Tian Xia World Guide</em>&nbsp;is no exception. Known for fanciful and often extravagant prose, her work reimagining Minata is most evident in phrases like "swallowing dragons like krill" and "churned the sea like a mortar and pestle." In addition to authoring the chapter on Minata, she contributed substantial Minata-adjacent content to the&nbsp;<em>Tian Xia Character Guide</em>. When she's not writing for Pathfinder, Dana is a full-time content creator at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tpkbrewing.com/">TPK Brewing Co.</a>, a tabletop roleplaying-themed brewery she co-owns in Portland, Oregon.</p>

              <h3>John Godek III (he/him)</h3>
              <p>Hi! I’m John, a mixed-race Filipino American gamer, gamemaster, freelancer, and podcaster. For the&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Tian Xia World Guide</em>&nbsp;I wrote the Oceans of Tian Xia as well as several new Tian ships, along with Yamatsumi the mountain god and General Susumu. I was very excited to work on these as I spent my early childhood in Hawai'i and Philippines, and later sailed the seven seas as I started my career.</p>
              <p>As a freelance game designer, I’ve written mostly for Paizo but also some for Evil Robot Games and Legendary Games. As a gamemaster, I earned my 5th Nova in 2021 and have volunteered at dozens of gaming conventions. As a podcaster, I produce three podcasts on the Know Direction Network:&nbsp;<a href="https://knowdirectionpodcast.com/category/podcasts/digital-divination/">Digital Divination</a>, with Paizo Senior Designer Jason Keeley and D&amp;D Designer Ron Lundeen;&nbsp;<a href="https://knowdirectionpodcast.com/category/podcasts/intrepid-heroes/">Intrepid Heroes</a>, an RPG actual play where we just completed the&nbsp;<a href="https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventures/adventurePath/devastationArk">Devastation Ark</a>&nbsp;AP and soon begin a&nbsp;<a href="https://evilhat.com/product/scum-and-villainy/">Scum and Villainy</a>&nbsp;adventure run by Jason Keeley; and&nbsp;<a href="https://knowdirectionpodcast.com/category/podcasts/presenting/">Presenting - Gamers Making Games</a>, a podcast where I have interviewed over 100 game designers, developers, artists, and editors. In addition, I am also GMing a&nbsp;<a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/fistsOfTheRubyPhoenix">Fists of the Ruby Phoenix</a>&nbsp;campaign and playing&nbsp;<a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/outlawsOfAlkenstar">Outlaws of Alkenstar</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://dndstore.wizards.com/us/en/product/820944/planescape-adventures-in-the-multiverse-digital-plus-physical-bundle">Planescape: Adventures in the Multiverse</a>. In my non-gaming life, I am a university professor teaching entrepreneurship and social venture creation in the Seattle area.</p>

              <h3>Daniel Kwan (he/him)</h3>
              <p>Hello! My name's Daniel! I'm the co-host of the Asians Represent Podcast and am a freelance game designer and cultural consultant with over 40 games credits! The&nbsp;<em>Tian Xia World Guide</em>&nbsp;is my second Paizo contribution and certainly the one I'm most excited about. I had a blast bringing my love of weapons, horror, and mythology to life for the project. It is such an honor to be part of such a diverse team of Asian creatives who have worked so hard to bring life to Tian Xia! Fun fact, some of my fellow freelancers and I started a home game to test out many of our contributions during the development period!</p>

              <h3>Jacky Leung (he/they)</h3>
              <p>Hey, everyone! I'm Jacky Leung, and it's been a while since I worked freelance for Paizo. Tian Xia was an amazing experience to revisit as a player and a creator. I had the pleasure of writing for Po Li and expanding life in a country ruled by the theologic elite and how people governed by oracles thrive despite its previously sheltered portrayal in earlier works. I had the opportunity to provide faces to the extremely secretive Oracular Council that governs Po Li, introduce the equally secretive Lapis Watchers, and expand new iconic locations for players to explore such as Tuotuo, the Enlightened City—a historical education center containing special archives housing racks of prophecies and oracular writings. Beyond the nostalgic glamor lies also the Emperor's Footprint, a site rumored to contain mystical properties, a supposed asteroid, and stunning panoramic beauty—just highly dangerous and full of monsters, I'm sure it's fine. I hope folx gets to experience the social and political dissonance that awaits them when adventuring through Po Li; it was a fantastic challenge.</p>

              <p>I'm a freelance writer, artist, GM, producer, editor, and TTRPG performer who just can't say no. Tian Xia was my first big Paizo gig, but if you want to see more of my little grabby hands making a gorgeous mess of Pathfinder 2e, you should check out my podcast! Goblets and Gays is an award-winning, Pathfinder 2e Actual Play podcast. With our first campaign "Blood of Kings" wrapped up, we're in the middle of releasing our second campaign "Tyrant of the Dark Star". ToDS is a grim dark Pathfinder 2e Remastered actual play set in the gothic-horror homebrew world of Noxlight.</p>

              <h3>Adam Ma (he/him)</h3>
              <p>Hello friends! I'm so excited for you all to sink into this beautiful world. For many of you it will be a marvelous opportunity to immerse yourself in a land rich with cultures perhaps outside your own. I'm right there with you. This was my first contribution to Pathfinder's rich world, and I never expected to go so deep into exploring my own culture and heritage through the lens of Wanshou's horror and paranoia. Just remember, if anything bad happens to your party while exploring this flooded land, it's definitely not a coincidence and probably your party member's fault. You know which one I'm talking about.</p>
              <p>I work on all kinds of TTRPG content, so if you're into grand adventure with a bit of horror, then we'll get along great! If you're a fan of my contribution to Tian Xia and want to follow my other work you can find me on&nbsp;<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/34thgingerbread.bsky.social">Bsky</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/34thGingerbread">Twitter</a>&nbsp;as 34thGingerbread - or you can visit my website:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.adam34th.com/">https://www.adam34th.com/</a></p>

I'm Tan Shao Han / 陈绍涵 (family name Tan/Chen, 陈; generational name, Shao 绍; personal name, Han 涵), a TTRPG creator, lecturer, and cultural consultant from Singapore, Southeast Asia. I'm proudly part of the RPGSEA TTRPG design movement based in Southeast Asia! I grew up a steady diet on wuxia media (movies, books, TV series, manhua), and am happy to re-imagine and create settings (the histories, lands, and peoples of Goka and Songbai) in the&nbsp;<em>Tian Xia World Guide</em>&nbsp;to inspire the telling of new wuxia-influenced stories in your Pathfinder games! It has been an absolute privilege to work on the Tian Xia books, alongside great colleagues and supervisors whom I now have the pleasure to call my friends.</p>
              <p>Outside of freelancing with Paizo, I also run an indie TTRPG company,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.curiouschimeras.com/">Curious Chimeras</a>.

              <p>Hello, y’all! Ruvaid here. You may have seen my name in previous Paizo books such as&nbsp;<em>Dark Archive</em>,&nbsp;<em>Impossible Lands</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Rage of Elements</em>. For the&nbsp;<em>Tian Xia World Guide</em>, I wrote the entry for the nation of Hongal. I have a deep appreciation for Mongolian culture from which Hongal draws inspiration, and I endeavored to bring as much respect to my words as possible. I sincerely hope that you enjoy reading about Hongal as much as I enjoyed writing about it.</p>

              <h3>Grady Wang (he/him)</h3>
              <p>Howdy, I'm Grady and my work on Chu Ye in the&nbsp;<em>World Guide</em>&nbsp;was my first-ever assignment for Paizo! I'm so excited that it's finally out! This nation has incredible potential for grand stories, from its historical contributions to medicinal knowledge to the present-day four-way clash between its greedy oni ruling class, a scrappy humanoid rebellion, an underworld dragon out for revenge, and a jealous god. I was also thrilled to be able to draw upon my Chinese and Taiwanese heritages to expand Chu Ye’s culture and its experiences under occupation.</p>
              <p>My next contribution will be in the&nbsp;<em>Character Guide</em>&nbsp;coming later this year, which contains Tian Xia’s unique takes on medicine. You can also find me online at The Gallant Goblin where my partner and I review TTRPG products on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/thegallantgoblin">https://www.youtube.com/thegallantgoblin</a>, sell kobold plushies at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gallantgoblin.com/heroplush/">heroplush.com</a>, and produce expanded content for Pathfinder at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pathfinderinfinite.com/">https://www.pathfinderinfinite.com/</a>, where we just released the first community print-on-demand product,&nbsp;<em>Adventures in Jalmeray</em>, which is an anthology of three adventures set in Jalmeray (<em>Lost Omens: Impossible Lands</em>) designed by an all-Desi team of writers!</p>
