  \ from the new Paizo caverns! As the newest addition to the war party, it falls\
  \ on me to write today's blog. I am Crystal, and yes, I am named after a shiny rock.\
  \ We can all thank my grandfather and his love of all things shiny.</p> \n   <p>When\
  \ I first met the very talented Sarah Robinson in a hotel restroom and asked her\
  \ about layout and design, I never expected that to turn into a real internship,\
  \ let alone a job. My own experience in production work has been limited, but my\
  \ enthusiasm, wit, and mastery of fire have impressed the Paizo staff enough to\
  \ bring me into the fold.</p> \n   <p>It's hardly surprising, of course. Much of\
  \ my life has been spent gaming or burning down peasant villages, the two skills\
  \ the gaming industry demands.</p> \n   <p>My first experiences with roleplaying\
  \ come from junior high, where I was none-too-politely barred from joining the gaming\
  \ club for 1) being a girl, 2) never having played before, and 3) mauling the faculty\
  \ advisor (see issue #1 and #2). My first play experience came in high school, thanks\
  \ to Palladium Books' <i>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Other Strangeness.</i>\
  \ As a poor country goblin, I didn't even have my own fancy dice; instead I used\
  \ paper lunch sacks. I filled them with numbered chits, and just drew my results\
  \ instead of rolling for them. Some days I miss my \"b20.\" Since then, games have\
  \ filled my life, even to the point of writing and developing a few projects for\
  \ small companies. Some of the stellar games I obsess over include Green Ronin's\
  \ <a href=\"/store/games/roleplayingGames/m/mutantsMasterminds\" target=\"nofollow\"\
  ><i>Mutants and Masterminds</i></a>, Wizards of the Coast's <a href=\"/store/byCompany/w/wizardsOfTheCoast/featuredBrands/d20modern\"\
  \ target=\"nofollow\"><i>d20 Modern</i></a> and <a href=\"/store/byCompany/w/wizardsOfTheCoast/byProductType/roleplayingGames/dungeonsDragons/3rdEdition/environmentalGuidebooks/v5748btpy7b33\"\
  \ target=\"nofollow\"><i>Ghostwalk</i></a>, <i>Hijinks</i> (created by Paizo for\
  \ <a href=\"/store/downloads/dungeon/v5748btpy7z7f\" target=\"nofollow\"><i>Polyhedron</i>\
  \ #158</a>), and Margaret Weiss's <a href=\"/store/byCompany/m/margaretWeisProductions/serenityRPG\"\
  \ target=\"nofollow\"><i>Serenity RPG</i></a>, as well as the obscure and unheard-of\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG\" target=\"nofollow\"><i>Pathfinder RPG</i></a>.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>My mastery of fire is a meandering, unlikely tale and will need to wait\
  \ for another day.</p> \n   <p>Working with the Paizo crew is exciting; these are\
  \ some of the best writers, developers, and designers in the industry, and they\
  \ work hard at jobs they love. Never have I seen such dedication in any career that\
  \ did not include the words \"chocolate factory\" or \"brewery.\" The offices themselves\
  \ are delightfully non-Euclidean, and I've learned the hard way to keep my distance\
  \ from the impossible corners and ignore the whispers.</p> \n   <p>As a production\
  \ assistant, I help fill in the cracks and manage the grunt work for Paizo's savage\
  \ art directors, James Davis and Sarah Robinson. This usually means managing the\
  \ digital archives, making changes the editors want, and topping off the coffee.\
  \ The harder I work, the easier it is for James and Sarah to weave their arcane\
  \ rituals, transforming the mad, gibbering scrawls the editors create into those\
  \ glorious Pathfinder and Gamemastery products we all know and love. Also, twice\
  \ a week I descend into the sub-basement and feed the cave-raptors, lest their terrible\
  \ hungers overwhelm them and they rampage through the offices, making books late.\
  \ </p> \n   <p>And none of this would be possible if I hadn't worked up the nerve\
  \ to talk to Sarah about learning the layout arts. So remember, if you really want\
  \ to work for Paizo Publishing, the secret is propositioning someone in the bathroom!*</p>\
