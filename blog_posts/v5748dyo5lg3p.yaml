  \ Take the Gauntlet</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, May 6, 2014</p> \n   <div\
  \ itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">We here at Paizo\
  \ take gaming seriously, and when we heard about an opportunity to play games for\
  \ charity, we just could not resist. On May 18th, a four-member team of elite goblin\
  \ commandos will descend upon Card Kingdom in Seattle to do battle with other teams\
  \ for the right to claim The Gauntlet, a truly epic trophy made from an actual gauntlet.\
  \ With foes like Bungie, GeekGirlCon, the Lady Planeswalkers, Wizards of the Coast,\
  \ and Penny Arcade, we are going to be facing off against some serious opponents.\
  \ That is where you come in. You can help us achieve victory for the goblin horde!</span></p>\

  \    </div> \n    <p>From now until May 18th, you can donate to the Child's Play\
  \ charity, a great organization that donates toys and games to children in hospitals\
  \ all around the world. Money that you donate can help the Paizo team earn \"Power\
  \ Ups\" during the tournament, giving us the edge we need to win! Make sure to put\
  \ \"Donated to the Paizo team\" in the comment box so it is applied to our team.</p>\

  \ Mona is the Publisher at Paizo, a former editor of Dragon, Dungeon, and Polyhedron\
  \ magazines, and a co-creator of the Pathfinder world. These days he spends more\
  \ time on business than on games, but like any corporate mastermind, he can stab\
  \ you in the back at a moment's notice, gaining the upper hand in any challenge.\
  \ With a coat, vest, and tie, Mona swears to put his evil powers to good use in\
  \ the vicious scrum for the Gauntlet. For charity. But most importantly, for the\

  \ an animated series showrunner, an alternate reality game designer, and other things\
  \ that she may or may not admit to if you bribe her with chocolate. She plans to\
  \ triumph in the Gauntlet—for the children, of course—through logic, skill, planning,\
  \ and occasional devious manipulation, which should make it just like her day job.</p>\
