  \ Guest Stars</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Thursday, August 26, 2010</p> \n    <p>After\
  \ a long hiatus because of convention season, the drow nobles game continued with\
  \ a hunt for the kidnapped acting matron of the House Azrinae—and split into two\
  \ groups of PCs when Ylvirixna (Rob McCreary) and Alivora (James Jacobs) decided\
  \ the matron (decerebrated by mi-go) was no longer in charge and ran off with her\
  \ body. Confounded by this betrayal, Rackutio (Josh Frost), Phyxafein (Tim Nightengale),\
  \ and Verandia (Jodi Lane) returned to the drow city of Far Parathra to plan their\
  \ next move. Or so they thought.</p> \n    <p>The group couldn't find Zwimessa (Crystal\
  \ Frasier) when they left to find the matron that morning (Crystal missed that session).\
  \ Zwimessa, meanwhile, couldn't find any of the others when she woke—their rooms\
  \ were empty, and the drow commoner prisoner they had taken from their occupied\
  \ house was dead in one of the rooms. Hiring a diviner in Far Parathra, Zwimessa\
  \ found that her family members had been kidnapped, and paid the mage to teleport\
  \ her to where they were held, bringing two mage-called demons (Kelly Marie and\
  \ Troy Siefker) with her for extra muscle.</p>\n    <p> </p>\n   </blockquote>\n\

  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n   </div> \n   <blockquote> \n    <p>Zwimessa, Fumerott (Kelly),\
  \ and Poograh (Troy) arrived just outside of a strange laboratory where three mi-go\
  \ had Alivorah, Phyxafein, Rackutio, Verandia, and Ylvirixna strapped to tables,\
  \ with needles in their skulls connected to strange metal canisters. After routing\
  \ the mi-go, Zwimessa's team freed the others, though Ylvirixna's brain had been\
  \ removed and had to be put back in her skull with some powerful healing magic.\
  \ Retrieving their gear from a nearby nook, the drow followed an escape tunnel (with\
  \ a comatose Ylvirixna riding Alivorah's snake-like <i>phantom steed</i>).</p>\n\
  \    <p> </p>\n   </blockquote>\n   <div align=\"center\">\n    <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/ExilesOfZirnakaynin-EscapeTunnel.jpg\"\

  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n   </div> \n   <blockquote> \n    <p>The tunnel opened up into\
  \ a cavern with several mi-go crates (each marked with magical runes) and a strange\
  \ underground lake. While investigating the crates, they spotted movement in the\
  \ murky water, and something hurled a rock at Zwimessa. </p>\n   </blockquote>\n\

  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n   </div> \n   <blockquote> \n    <p>What followed was a furious\
  \ battle with a pair of giant fish-men and two mutated, skinned ghouls. Fumerott\
  \ grabbed and hurled one of the ghouls to the shore so Alivorah, Rackutio, and Verandia\
  \ would have something to fight. Rackutio cast <i>hungry pit</i> on it, pulling\
  \ in the wounded creature as well as two of the crates, which exploded on impact.\
  \ OM NOM NOM! On the other side of the battle, the two giant fish-men deal horrendous\
  \ damage to Poograh, but the stubborn demon continues to fight.</p>\n    <p> </p>\n\

  \ make short work of the remaining mutant ghoul, prompting the demon to eat her\
  \ fallen enemy. Delicious!</p>\n    <p> </p>\n   </blockquote>\n   <div align=\"\

  \ their attention on 20, Rackutio's eidolon, and managed to tear it apart, sending\
  \ it back to its home plane. As the rest of the group converged on these foes, Rackutio\
  \ summoned a greater water elemental (represented by a fire elemental in this picture,\
  \ recolored blue with the magic of photo manipulation) to pound on the slimy things,\
  \ and Verandia ended the fight with a controlled burst of channeled negative energy.\
  \ Time to rest and loot... which, in Poograh's case, included eating the dead fish-men!</p>\n\

  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n   </div> \n   <blockquote> \n    <p><b>Tip</b>: If you have\
  \ players who are new to the Pathfinder RPG (as Kelly and Troy were) or gaming in\
  \ general, all the choices for a classed character can be overwhelming. Sometimes\
  \ it's easier to have them play an allied monster, which has fewer options for the\
  \ player to learn. In this case, I copied the stats for a hezrou demon onto a character\
  \ sheet, removed references to rules they didn't need to know about (like Improved\
  \ Initiative, which is built into the stat block), summarized other complex abilities\
  \ (like <i>greater teleport</i>), and didn't include other abilities they wouldn't\
  \ need (like <i>summon</i>). This let them focus on playing their monster characters\
  \ and dealing with dice rolls for attacks, damage, skills, and saves. Because these\
  \ players are only present for this one high-level session, using conjured monsters\
  \ allows them to play without devising a complex in-game story for why these two\
  \ characters would show up and leave after a short time.</p> \n    <p>Sean K Reynolds\
