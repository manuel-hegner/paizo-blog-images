  articlebody\"> \n     <p><span itemprop=\"description\">I was out sick last Friday,\
  \ so we’ve fallen a bit behind on our scheduled previews of new figures from <a\
  \ href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy96kb?Pathfinder-Battles-Lost-Coast\">The\
  \ Lost Coast</a> set of <em>Pathfinder Battles</em> prepainted plastic miniatures,\
  \ which is set for a November release. I’ve got six figures to show off today, so\
  \ let’s not waste time!</span></p> \n     <p>All of these figures (and any that\
  \ are left after this) were the victims of bad photographs way back in the paint\
  \ master stage. In the meantime, WizKids sent us actual production run figures,\
  \ so everything you see from <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy96kb?Pathfinder-Battles-Lost-Coast\"\
  >The Lost Coast</a> from this point forward are actual production figures, not paint\
  \ masters.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20140926-GoblinDruid.jpg\"\
  > <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20140926-GoblinDruid_180.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>Here we have the Goblin Druid, who is based off the much-hated\
  \ druid Gogmurt from the <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy8tc0?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-Rise-of-the-Runelords-Anniversary-Edition\"\
  ><em>Rise of the Runelords Adventure Path Anniversary Edition</em></a> hardcover.\
  \ He easily doubles as any goblin spellcaster. If you want, you can pair him up\
  \ with the Firepelt Cougar we previewed a few weeks back to complete the official\
  \ Gogmurt encounter. The Goblin Druid is a Small, common figure.</p> \n     <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20140926-SeaHag.jpg\"\
  > <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20140926-SeaHag_180.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>And this is the Green Hag, your basic hag from page 167 of\
  \ the <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy8auu?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Bestiary\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Bestiary</em></a>. She’s an effective but pretty\
  \ simple figure in terms of sculpt and paint scheme, so we slated her at the common\
  \ rarity. The Green Hag is a Medium figure.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  > <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20140926-ShiftyNoble.jpg\"> <img src=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderBattles/20140926-ShiftyNoble_180.jpeg\"></a>\n     </div>\
  \ \n     <p>This is the Shifty Noble, which we drew from page 56 of <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy8slp?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Magnimar-City-of-Monuments\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Magnimar, City of Monuments</em></a>. I’m not\
  \ certain the picture does this figure justice. With one hand held forward in a\
  \ come-hither pose and the other behind her back clutching a deadly dagger, this\
  \ is one untrustworthy scion you do not want to cross. The Shifty Noble is a Medium,\
  \ uncommon figure with a great sense of “three dimensionality” to her.</p> \n  \
  \   <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20140926-SinspawnChampion.jpg\"\
  > <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20140926-SinspawnChampion_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Look out, it’s the Sinspawn Champion! We pulled this\
  \ nasty critter off the cover of <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy8lv5?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Dungeons-of-Golarion\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Dungeons of Golarion</em></a>. He makes a great\
  \ boss for the two Sinspawn already in the <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy8rqs?Pathfinder-Battles-Rise-of-the-Runelords\"\
  >Rise of the Runelords</a> set, or you can put a bunch of him with a bunch of them\
  \ to fill out the ranks of a Sinspawn horde. The Sinspawn Champion is a (fairly\
  \ tall) Medium, uncommon figure.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderBattles/20140926-Boggard.jpg\"> <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20140926-Boggard_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>We already produced a Boggard back in <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy8v0b?Pathfinder-Battles-Shattered-Star\"\
  >Shattered Star</a>, but he was more of a chieftain/mystic sort of guy. This Boggard\
  \ Warrior is your run-of-the-mill amphibious humanoid fighter type. He’s a Medium,\
  \ uncommon figure.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20140926-LeapingBoggard.jpg\"\
  > <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20140926-LeapingBoggard_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>And this guy is the Leaping Boggard, his jumpy companion!\
  \ You might not understand why until you’re holding him in your own hands, but I\
  \ think this guy may be my favorite in the entire set. I love his tongue, his weird\
  \ eyes, and especially his pose. Looking at him just makes me laugh, a quality I’\
  ve always liked in my frog-people. The Leaping Boggard is a Medium, uncommon figure.</p>\
  \ \n     <h2>And Now, the Bad News</h2> \n     <p>Last time we met with WizKids,\
  \ they brought in samples of the repainted Feiya and King Irovetti, two figures\
  \ from previous sets that did not get the paint application they deserved and hence\
  \ resulted in a lot of justified complaints. I’m happy to say that King Irovetti\
  \ looked fantastic. Amazing, even. </p> \n     <p>I’m unhappy to say that Feiya\
  \ still looked pretty bad, especially in the face department. WizKids was very up\
  \ front about this before we ever saw the figure, but the end result is that after\
  \ testing several different repainting options, WizKids has come to the conclusion\
  \ that the problem with the Feiya miniature is in fact the sculpt, in particular\
  \ the lack of deep detail on the face that leads to the paint obscuring most of\
  \ what detail is actually there.</p> \n     <p>That means that the existing Feiya\
  \ sculpt is not going to work for the proposed replacement figures that were set\
  \ to be inserted into <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy96kb?Pathfinder-Battles-Lost-Coast\"\
  >The Lost Coast</a>. WizKids is going back to sculpt on the figure. They’ll now\
  \ create a new Feiya sculpt with their current digital sculpting tools, with a pose\
  \ that attempts to match as closely as possible the original figure, but with a\
  \ better face sculpt.</p> \n     <p>That means that the Feiya and King Irovetti\
  \ replacement figures <strong>will not appear</strong> in <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy96kb?Pathfinder-Battles-Lost-Coast\"\
  >The Lost Coast</a>, and will instead be inserted into the <strong>next</strong>\
  \ set we do after that. We apologize for the delay, but I for one am impressed with\
  \ WizKids taking the initiative to fix the problem. None of us needs more bad Feiya\
  \ figures.</p> \n     <p>So, yeah, mild disappointment there, but they are still\
  \ committed to creating replacement figures, and I’m confident that the new sculpt\
  \ will be amazing.</p> \n     <p><strong>Why</strong> am I so confident in the quality\
  \ of WizKids’s new digital sculpts? Why, because they also brought in the paint\
  \ masters for the first <em>Iconic Heroes</em> set (January 2015), and they are\
  \ by far the best-looking Medium-sized figures I’ve seen from them to date.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>But you’re going to have to take my word for it for now, as I am holding\
  \ <em>those</em> photos for next week’s preview!</p> \n     <p>See you then!</p>\
