  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\"><em>Flowers. Puh.</em></p>\
  \ \n     <p>Teph grumbled as he trudged over the uneven ground. The tended dirt\
  \ path was long gone by now, and his boots felt every bump of root and pinch of\
  \ pebble. In the distance, well past the canopy and out of sight, thunder growled.\
  \ The boy pulled his jacket tighter, hoping the storm would miss them tonight; he\
  \ still had one more task before he could return home.</p> \n     <p>Gathering splitheart\
  \ flowers. </p> \n     <p>The spiky, red flowers were a favorite of Mom’s, and they\
  \ had just started to burst, revealing their perfect, crimson seeds. <em>The seeds\
  \ fight off mosquitos. The leaves you boil for fevers.</em></p> \n     <p>Also,\
  \ Teph noted, Mom liked to turn the petals into a paste to deepen the shade of her\
  \ lips. He’d even tried it once himself, but found it altogether unpleasant; it\
  \ smelled funny and he didn’t like how dark it made his mouth. He liked his lips\
  \ just fine the way they were, thank you. Why did girls even <em>like</em> lip-color?</p>\
  \ \n     <p>He arrived at the patch of splitheart and drew out his gathering pouch.\
  \ Selecting only the ripest of the prickly flowers, he gathered each with a pinch\
  \ of his fingers and a quiet word of thanks to the earth.</p> \n     <p>He arrived\
  \ at the patch of splitheart and drew out his gathering pouch. Selecting only the\
  \ ripest of the prickly flowers, he gathered each with a pinch of his fingers and\
  \ a quiet word of thanks to the earth.</p> \n     <p>Flower picking. Teph rolled\
  \ his eyes. This was not what heroes did.</p> \n     <p>The thought lingered as\
  \ Teph wound his way back home. Real heroes got to solve mysteries, fight evil creatures,\
  \ and save the day. Some day, he’d be a hero, like the ones in his favorite book,\
  \ <em>The Grand Adventures of the Golden Wayfarers</em>. He’d be fast like Celadir\
  \ Wind-Blown, dancing from rooftop to rooftop, his arrows always finding their mark.\
  \ He’d be strong like Ukhul the Just, defending the helpless with a swing of his\
  \ mighty sword. And he’d be wise and magical, like Zuridani Sunborn, summoning the\
  \ elements themselves to help him win the day.</p> \n     <p>Teph painted his fingernails\
  \ silver so they glittered when he moved his hands—just like Zuridani’s hands sparkled\
  \ when he cast his spells. He even knew what his familiar would be: a fae dragon\
  \ with one of its insectile wings blue and the other green—just like its eyes would\
  \ be. Just like Teph’s were.</p> \n     <p>With his heroic heart and brave soul,\
  \ he’d solve the world’s mysteries and save the day, and everyone would finally\
  \ welcome him in the city instead of stare, distrusting. He wouldn’t have to keep\
  \ a low profile or avoid the city at all; instead, they’d build him a tower of his\
  \ own right in the middle of town, and his dad would never have to leave home again!</p>\
  \ \n     <p>He’d make them welcome his mom, too, and make everyone apologize to\
  \ them—for everything. For the ugly names they called him. For the horrible accusations\
  \ they leveled at her.</p> \n     <p>The air grew colder, as did the boy’s mood;\
  \ Teph knew in his stomach that the storm would arrive before dawn. Best not to\
  \ dawdle. He skipped his usual extra stop at the eldest annon tree, and instead\
  \ retraced his steps to the dirt path that led home. </p> \n     <p>The cottage\
  \ just within the woods’ edge had been carefully built between the trees, with wild\
  \ grasses and long stalks of cultivated herbs bending lazily in the chilling wind.\
  \ The area was thick with the smell of herbs, intermingled with the sharp, stinging\
  \ scent of the coming rains. It was usually a comfort. Usually a feeling of safety.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Right now, though, it was...<em>off</em>.</p> \n     <p>The heavy front\
  \ door was halfway open, and no light could be seen from within. The decorative\
  \ wreath and spiraling horn they kept on the door had been knocked off and lay,\
  \ unloved, in the dirt. The comfort of being home disappeared, sinking heavily into\
  \ his stomach with the weight of fear. What happened? Where was Mom? Did she need\
  \ help?</p> \n     <p>The butterflies in his stomach warred with the excitement\
  \ pounding in his chest. This was his moment. The first of many. He could be a hero,\
  \ if he could just push back his fear.</p> \n     <p>Steeling himself, Teph crouched\
  \ low, like Celadir might. Moving slowly, carefully, he approached the cracked door,\
  \ senses alert for anything <em>off.</em></p> \n     <p>One step. Another. And then\
  \ he was at his door.</p> \n     <p>What would Celadir do? Right. Check for traps.\
  \ Trip-wires. Sounds of monsters past the doors.</p> \n     <p>…There was nothing.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Silence lay in wait just beyond, a stillness that made him hold his\
  \ breath to quiet his own heartbeat. Fear was okay. Even Dad had said so. Fear was\
  \ okay as long as it didn’t stop you completely.</p> \n     <p>He reached for the\
  \ spiraling horn, the only potential weapon nearby, and his fingertips winked silver\
  \ at him. His “magic,” there with him. It seemed to settle his heart and bring additional\
  \ resolve; he knew this place inside and out. He would be okay. He would find whatever\
  \ had broken into his home and bring it to justice.</p> \n     <p><em>One day I\
  \ will save everyone. Let it start with this.</em></p> \n     <p>His fingers tightened\
  \ around the curled horn, and with a mighty roar to make Ukhul the Just proud, Teph\
  \ knocked the door completely open and charged inside, ready to fight.</p> \n  \
  \   <p>The burst of sound startled the large figure shadowed in the corner, and\
  \ it jumped to attention. Drawing itself to its full, massive height and towering\
  \ over the boy, the shadows rolled off of a bent, pockmarked hide. The wrinkled,\
  \ gnarled face loomed large, glowing, green eyes placed low on the face and emphasizing\
  \ a hunched back and strong muscles. Magic gathered at two gnarled, meaty fists,\
  \ and mighty Teph…screamed a high-pitch scream.</p> \n     <p>So did the figure.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The book the figure held flared as an illumination spell revealed the\
  \ craggy, lined face of the green hag made plain. Teph barked out a surprised yelp\
  \ and launched himself at it, dropping the curved horn and winding his arms tight\
  \ around her. </p> \n     <p>The hag’s arms matched the boy’s, wrapping him up tightly.\
  \ With the shock melting from her face, she squeezed him. “Sprout! You scared me.”\
  </p> \n     <p>“Mom,” gasped Teph. “I saw the door and it wasn’t closed right and\
  \ the wreath and knocker were on the ground and—”</p> \n     <p>Mom chuckled softly\
  \ at the stream of words flowing from Teph’s mouth. “There, there, Sprout. All is\
  \ well; I was just resting a bit. Catch probably just knocked the wreath loose trying\
  \ to get in.” She looked around, her vivid, emerald eyes landing on her familiar.\
  \ The spindly monkey drew the edge of the tablecloth around himself and chittered\
  \ guiltily.</p> \n     <p>“See, there you go,” Mom said. “Did you bring the splitheart?\
  \ Your father’s sure to be home soon.”</p> \n     <p>Teph nodded, handing over his\
  \ collecting pouch and immediately starting for the bookshelf. He was safe, Mom\
  \ was safe, and <em>The Grand Adventures of the Golden Wayfarers</em> called to\
  \ him. </p> \n     <p>“Ah-ah,” Mom croaked, re-lighting the room’s mirrored lantern\
  \ and letting her illumination spell fade. “Bath first. Story time later.”</p> \n\
  \     <p>“Mooooom,” whined Teph, giving up the path to the bookshelf even as he\
  \ complained.</p> \n     <p>Several scrubbings later, after a change into fresh\
  \ clothes, Father was home and the family basked in the glow of an over-full dinner\
  \ table and a warm fire in the hearth.</p> \n     <p>Mom always made fantastic dinners,\
  \ but they especially shone when Dad came home. The flatbreads were rolled tight\
  \ and sliced extra-thin. She’d roasted peppers and tomatoes, skewering them between\
  \ perfect, tender squares of meat. Roast honey-squash sweetened the air and lent\
  \ a mouth-watering contrast to the sharp spice of the peppered rice. And for dessert?\
  \ Hot cassava cakes with cold custard. </p> \n     <p>It almost made it worth the\
  \ <em>icky stuff.</em></p> \n     <p>Teph knew he should be happy; not everyone\
  \ had parents who loved each other so much. Not everyone even had parents. And especially\
  \ someone like him, a callow may with a human father and a hag mother; the relationship\
  \ that birthed the changeling was something special. Something genuine.</p> \n \

  t stop him from being grossed out every time Dad came home, all lovey-dovey kissy-sissy.\
  \ Tonight, it had been flowers and a poem. </p> \n     <p>“From seven bright meadows\
  \ I gathered you flowers,<br> From seven great trees I gathered the dew,<br> And\
  \ long have I been gone, just counting the hours<br> And following my heart’s Call\
  \ here, home to you.”</p> \n     <p><em>Eww.</em></p> \n     <p>After clearing the\
  \ food from the table, Teph grabbed <em>The Grand Adventures of the Golden Wayfarers</em>\
  \ and high-tailed it into the garden. The rain hadn’t started yet; he could still\
  \ get a few stories in before they called him for bedtime. He lit his lantern and\
  \ settled onto the cracked stone bench near the weeper tree. </p> \n     <p>Partway\
  \ through the second story, the trees <em>groaned</em> suddenly, snapping the boy’\
  s attention as something at the edge of the garden erupted from the ground. Twisting,\
  \ sharp, and half-hidden by the shadows, the thing creaked and crackled, sinews\
  \ twisting in the dim light of the boy’s lantern.</p> \n     <p>And then it was\
  \ silent again. Still. And not for the first time today, Teph’s heart raced as he\
  \ faced down a potential danger. Hiding in the weeper tree’s folds, he carefully\
  \ aimed his lantern in the direction of the <em>thing</em>, and paused as he tried\
  \ to understand the sight.</p> \n     <p>It was…a tree, but not. Spiraling grains\
  \ of branches twisted about themselves over and over, like a strange series of veins\
  \ making one large, tall structure. The wood looked old and petrified, as though\
  \ it hadn’t just been born from nothing.</p> \n     <p>Was it….a tooth? It couldn’\
  t be; it was definitely wood. He knew that much at first glance. A giant, petrified\
  \ wooden tooth, swirling and vein-like.</p> \n     <p><em>No</em>, something in\
  \ his mind insisted. Not just a tooth. Something far better! A <em>mystery</em>!</p>\
  \ \n     <p><em>Real heroes solve mysteries, fight evil, and save the day. Let it\
  \ start with this. </em></p> \n     <p>Eyes wide, heart pounding excitedly, Teph\
  \ stepped toward the tree.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p style=\"font-weight:\
