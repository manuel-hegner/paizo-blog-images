  \ \n     <p>“I have had the pleasure of working closely with Jim from his days at\
  \ TSR through his time working on Dungeons &amp; Dragons 3rd Edition at Wizards\
  \ of the Coast, and now working with me at Paizo,” Paizo CEO Lisa Stevens said.\
  \ Jim is a hardworking visionary whose almost three decades of game experience makes\
  \ him the perfect person to guide Paizo into its third decade.”</p> \n     <p>“\
  I’m grateful for the trust that Lisa and the Leadership Team have placed in me to\
  \ lead Paizo,” Jim Butler said. “I look forward to working with my fellow employees\
  \ to lead the company into the next era of tabletop excellence.”</p> \n     <p>Jim\
  \ brings decades of gaming experience to his new role, including serving as Paizo’\
  s vice president of marketing and licensing over the last five years. Before Paizo,\
  \ he has worked at TSR, Wizards of the Coast, Warner Bros./Turbine, and Trion Worlds.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“I started my gaming career as an editor and game designer, switching\
  \ over to marketing and brand management when Peter Adkison wanted ‘gamers with\
  \ business degrees’ running Dungeons &amp; Dragons,” Jim said. “It’s been an epic\
  \ adventure so far, and I’m excited that a new chapter has begun.”</p> \n     <p>Jim\
  \ lives in Redmond, WA with his husband, Matthew, and their fur-kids: Toker, Stella,\
  \ and Skylar. He’s currently playing through volume 5 of the Pathfinder Return of\
  \ the Runelords Adventure Path as a kobold druid and GMing the Extinction Curse\
  \ Adventure Path for Pathfinder Second Edition.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n   </div>\
