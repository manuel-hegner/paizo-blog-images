  \ Home of the Elves</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Monday, September 15, 2008</p>\
  \ \n    <p>For the last several months of <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/secondDarkness\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder</i>'s Second Darkness Adventure Path</a> we've been neck-deep in\
  \ drow, with one terrible question looming over our heads all the while: With such\
  \ a history of fantastic dark elven cities, where do the drow of Golarion actually\
  \ live? The answer started as a sketch on a single piece of graph paper and grew\
  \ into a tape and grid work monstrosity that would dominate my dining room table\
  \ for several weeks. From this ever-expanding madness eventually developed a vast\
  \ underground metropolis I eventually dubbed Zirnakaynin, the Last Home of the Elves.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>While the city of the drow won't completely take shape until <a href=\"\
  /store/v5748btpy81tq\">Pathfinder #16,</a> players at last Gen Con's Ascension of\
  \ the Drow Pathfinder Society event got a first look at the massive, tri-cavern\
  \ subterranean domain. For everyone who missed out on Ascension, though, here's\
  \ a sneak peek of the heart of the drow race, their stockade and sanctuary: Zirnakaynin.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>None, not even the drow, can say how long their ancestors wandered the\
  \ darkness, but for more than 8,000 years settlements have stood among the severe\
  \ cliffs of Cocyrdavarin, the great cavern that now holds Zirnakaynin. The first\
  \ walls of the city rose upon the cavern's highest scarp, and like a glacier slowly\
  \ crashed down upon the lower slopes. Over time, each level took on a distinct name\
  \ and characteristics.</p> \n    <p>Atop the crowning plateau stand the ancient\
  \ bladed walls of the Last City, the densely packed heart of Zirnakaynin, where\
  \ the drow first clustered in fear of the dark. Today, it is home to the city's\
  \ wealthiest and most powerful non-nobles, cruel artisans and performers, and purveyors\
  \ of all manner of decadences. At the plateau's westernmost edge, amid gardens of\
  \ dark stone, stands the topless tower of Ileccinoc, the seat of the city's ruling\
  \ council, the many-spired column that looms over all Zirnakaynin.</p> \n    <p>Beneath\
  \ the heights of the Last City sprawls Arsyrvhar, the Pale March, home to most of\
  \ they city's drow population, many of its everyday shops and residences, and the\
  \ markets of Ovessia. Mingling among the common drow, merchants from Zirnakaynin's\
  \ slave cities and strange locales throughout the Darklands travel here to bargain\
  \ and curry the favor of drow nobles. Those traders whose wares are considered unworthy\
  \ for elven consumption are banished from the bustling district to the slum-bazaar\
  \ of Drashes in Ghenavoc.</p> \n    <p>The lowest span of Cocyrdavarin, the Pit\
  \ of Ghenavoc hosts the most worthless of drow society: the low-born, the deformed,\
  \ the city's few freed slaves, and foreign residents. Among workhouses, slave pens,\
  \ drug dens, and warehouses, the least of Zirnakaynin's society scrape out pitiful\
  \ lives.</p> \n    <p>F. Wesley Schneider</p> \n    <br><i>Pathfinder</i> Managing\
