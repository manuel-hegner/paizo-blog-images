  \       <br><i>Illustration by Wayne Reynolds</i>\n      </div> \n      <p>Linxia\
  \ Benzekri was born and raised in Khari, the Chelish enclave on the northwest corner\
  \ of Garund. Although ethnically Garundi, Linxia always thought of herself as Chelaxian.\
  \ After all, Khari had been part of Cheliax since long before she was ever born,\
  \ and though Linxia's parents kept their Garundi surname, they gave her a traditional\
  \ Chelish first name. Her family long ago abandoned the clan ties that define many\
  \ Garundi, and while Linxia's grandparents still occasionally spoke Osiriani in\
  \ private, it was never spoken in her own home, and Linxia never bothered to learn\
  \ her native tongue. To Linxia, the mighty ruins of the Arch of Aroden that tower\
  \ above Khari were more a symbol of her heritage than the city's Rahadoumi sandstone\
  \ architecture.</p> \n      <p>When Linxia was still a child, her parents sent her\
  \ to an Asmodean convent. Both of Linxia's parents were successful merchants and\
  \ traders, and though they were not religious, they felt it was important for their\
  \ eldest child to receive a good education if she were to join the family business.\
  \ At the convent, Linxia learned the grand history of Cheliax, how House Thrune\
  \ unified a warring nation with the blessings of Asmodeus, and the necessity of\
  \ laws based on those of Hell itself to preserve an ordered society.</p> \n    \
  \  <p>Linxia returned home a teenager, now a loyal Chelish citizen ready to do her\
  \ part to support the empire. But she was taken aback when she overheard her parents\
  \ talking with an old family friend about a secret cabal of Garundi gentry who wanted\
  \ to return Khari to \"its rightful home\" of Rahadoum. Horrified that her parents\
  \ were involved in such a treasonous plot, Linxia reasoned that her parents' friend\
  \ must have lured them into the conspiracy, so she immediately reported them to\
  \ the city guard, the dottari.</p> \n      <p>That night, two Hellknights of the\
  \ Order of the Rack—dressed in their characteristic night-black armor and flayed-skin\
  \ cloaks—came to Linxia's house to arrest her parents for sedition. As her parents\
  \ were hauled away in chains, loudly proclaiming their innocence and begging the\
  \ impassive Hellknights to show mercy, Linxia only watched in silence. If her parents\
  \ were truly innocent, then she trusted the law to exonerate them.</p> \n      <p>Linxia's\
  \ parents were judged guilty that same night, and the next morning, Linxia went\
  \ to the city square to witness their sentences: scourged with whips until their\
  \ backs looked like the exposed musculature of the Hellknights' armor, crucified,\
  \ and then disemboweled. Through it all, Linxia watched without emotion. She was\
  \ not happy to see her parents' excruciation, but neither did she feel sadness.\
  \ Even though she still believed her parents were duped, they had been found guilty\
  \ of treason and had to be punished. The law had spoken. </p> \n      <p>Three days\
  \ later, when her parents finally succumbed to their tortures and died, Linxia made\
  \ a decision: she would become a Hellknight herself. Her parents' crime was not\
  \ their own—they had been misled by a friend, and paid the price. As a member of\
  \ the Order of the Rack, however, she could help protect other innocents from such\
  \ dangerous whispers and prevent them from suffering the same fate. The Hellknights\
  \ personified the law and order that guarded civilization and prevented it from\
  \ sliding back into barbarity; people like the \"friend\" who had deceived her parents\
  \ were criminals whose actions threatened the very fabric of society.</p> \n   \
  \   <p>As a symbol of her dedication, Linxia shaved her head and got a tattoo of\
  \ the Order of the Rack's symbol—a spiked torture wheel—on her forehead, so every\
  \ time she looked in the mirror she would be reminded of her goal, her purpose,\
  \ and the terrible consequences of failure. Linxia traveled to Avistan and presented\
  \ herself at the gates of Citadel Rivad, headquarters of the Order of the Rack,\
  \ and was accepted into the order as an armiger, a Hellknight squire in training.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Linxia devoted herself to her new calling, honing her mind and body\
  \ for the trials that lay ahead. She had received basic combat training at the Asmodean\
  \ monastery, but under the tutelage of the Hellknights, she learned to fight in\
  \ heavy armor, mastered the sword and whip, and learned strategy, tactics, and engineering.\
  \ When not practicing the arts of war, Linxia obsessively studied in Citadel Rivad's\
  \ library, memorizing the tenets of the Hellknights' philosophy, the Measure and\
  \ the Chain. To strengthen her resolve and desensitize herself to pain, Linxia regularly\
  \ and willingly underwent the Order of the Rack's reckoning, purging herself of\
  \ weakness and undisciplined thoughts by drinking boiling water until her throat\
  \ scarred and left her voice a ragged rasp.</p> \n      <p>Before Linxia could become\
  \ a full Hellknight, however, the Order of the Rack had a test for her loyalty.\
  \ One of Linxia's brothers had been arrested for attempting to rekindle the spark\
  \ of rebellion that had been stamped out in Khari with her parents' execution. He\
  \ had been tried, found guilty, and brought to Citadel Rivad for sentencing. Without\
  \ hesitation, Linxia drew her sword, and looking straight into her brother's eyes,\
  \ beheaded him without remorse. Like her parents, Linxia's brother had broken the\
  \ law. Justice was served.</p> \n      <p>With her training complete, her loyalty\
  \ and dedication to the law tested and found sufficient, Linxia faced her final\
  \ task: single combat with a summoned barbazu. All around her, many of her fellow\
  \ armigers failed in this final trial, slain by the devils' barbed glaives or succumbing\
  \ to infernal wounds and infections they suffered at the hands of the fiends. But\
  \ Linxia succeeded, emerging bloodied but triumphant, her studies, training, and\
  \ most of all, her determination, leading her to victory.</p> \n      <p>When she\
  \ had recovered from her ordeal, Linxia was accorded the full rank of Hellknight\
  \ and granted the symbol of her station: a suit of Hellknight plate armor, bearing\
  \ the same flayed musculature motif as the Hellknights who had arrested and executed\
  \ her parents. Now Linxia serves as a righteous bastion of law against the chaos\
  \ of insidious knowledge, corrupt philosophies, and rebellious thought. With her\
  \ sword, she enforces conformity and justice to preserve a peaceful and ordered\
  \ society—no matter the cost.</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>Stay tuned over\
