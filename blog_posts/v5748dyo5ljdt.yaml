  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\"><i>This\
  \ is the fourth installment of our strategy blog written by game historian <a href=\"\

  \ You can read all the installments <a href=\"/paizo/blog/tags/adventureCardGameStrategy\"\
  >here</a>.</i></p> \n    <p>When you start playing a Pathfinder Adventure Card Game\
  \ scenario, the first question you need to answer is which locations to send your\
  \ characters to. You must decide whether to <i>congregate</i> (group the characters\
  \ together) or <i>separate</i> (keep them apart).</p> \n    <p>It's <i>usually</i>\
  \ better to keep your characters apart, to avoid the multiplicative effects of barriers\
  \ and monsters that either damage everyone at a location or that cause everyone\
  \ at a location to fight monsters. Spreading out also gives you the opportunity\
  \ to temporarily close more locations when you find a villain. This is critical\
  \ at the end of the game, but it can still be helpful early in the game since it\
  \ limits the number of places that a villain can flee to, and limits the number\
  \ of cards removed from the blessings deck if you lose the battle.</p> \n    <p>It's\
  \ <i>also</i> better to keep specific characters apart from others if they're built\
  \ to work on their own. Harsk is able to help characters at other locations, and\
  \ Merisiel is a better fighter when she’s alone. Characters that have the Ranged\
  \ skill generally tend to be better by themselves.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Does not play well with others.</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>It's\
  \ <i>sometimes</i> better to keep your characters together, particularly if they\
  \ have cards or powers that allow them to help other characters at their location,\
  \ or if they need to face a monster or barrier that requires multiple checks to\
  \ defeat. In particular, many villains require two checks, so it's often helpful\
  \ to attack a villain with two characters.</p> \n    <p>It's <i>also</i> better\
  \ to keep specific characters together if they're built to work with others. Valeros\
  \ and Lem are the prime examples of this, since Valeros automatically adds to combat\
  \ checks at his location, and Lem can recharge cards to add to any check at his\
  \ location.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-ValerosCharacterFront.jpg\"\

  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-LemCharacterFront_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> <i>One is the by-the-book veteran one week from retirement. The\
  \ other is the wise-cracking maverick with nothing to lose. Together, they fight\
  \ evil.</i>\n    </div> \n    <p><i>Corollary #1: Consider splitting up when you've\
  \ closed two locations</i>. If you have been keeping your characters together, consider\
  \ splitting them up when you've closed two locations, because you should now have\
  \ one character per open location—enough to temporarily close everything when you\
  \ find the villain. Otherwise, <i>really</i> consider splitting up when you've closed\
  \ <i>three</i> locations, because you now have enough characters to double-team\
  \ one location or to keep helpers like Lem and Valeros with someone else.</p> \n\
  \    <p>However, the question of choosing location decks goes beyond whether you\
  \ should congregate characters or separate them: you also need to select which characters\
  \ to put at which locations!</p> \n    <h2>Choose Based on Your Character and the\
  \ Locations' Challenges</h2> \n    <p>When you initially choose where to place your\
  \ characters, do it based on the skills and cards of each character and how they\
  \ interact with the specifics of an individual location.</p> \n    <p><i>Corollary\
  \ #1: Select characters able to deal with a location's closing conditions.</i> Closing\
  \ locations is one of the most important actions in the game. That's how you gain\
  \ ground against the blessings deck countdown: by removing a location deck before\
  \ you dig all the way through it, you reduce the total number of cards that you\
  \ need to look at before you find the villain. This means the prime criteria for\
  \ selecting where to put a character should usually be whether that character is\
  \ good at closing that location or not. So you send Lem or Seoni to the Prison,\
  \ because of their high Charisma skills, and you send Kyra or Seelah to hallowed\
  \ (or unhallowed) ground, because of their high Divine skills.</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>You gotta get in to get out.</i>\n    </div> \n    <p><i>Corollary\
  \ #2: Select characters able to deal with a location's effects.</i> Some locations,\
  \ such as the Mountain Peak, have really painful effects. If one character can deal\
  \ with them better than the others, send that person there. (This usually also plays\
  \ into the former corollary, because special effects and closing conditions are\
  \ often linked.) Thus, you could send Kyra to the Mountain Peak, because she has\
  \ the Wisdom to deal with both the special effect at the start of the turn (which\
  \ could cause her to bury a card) and the closing condition. Amiri is a less traditional\
  \ choice, but very helpful because she can disappear from the Mountain Peak at the\
  \ start of each turn; as it happens, her survival skill is also good for closing\
  \ the location.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-MountainPeak.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-MountainPeak_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-KyraCharacterFront.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6000-KyraCharacterFront_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Yep—the answer to altitude is Wisdom.</i>\n    </div> \n   \
  \ <p><i>Corollary #3: Select characters able to deal with a location's cards.</i>\
  \ Finally, you can send a character to a location because they're the best able\
  \ to deal with the cards there. If a location is full of monsters, send a bruiser\
  \ like Valeros or Seoni rather than someone like Lini or even Harsk, who isn't as\
  \ good at one-on-one combat. Similarly, if a location is full of barriers, Merisiel\
  \ is often the best choice because of her high Dexterity and Disable skills (though\
  \ specific barriers might call for Wisdom, Perception, or other skills). </p>\n\
  \    <h2>Choose Based on Your Character and the Locations' Benefits</h2> \n    <p>The\
  \ flip side is that you can look at the benefits at a location and send the person\
  \ who is most able to take advantage of them.</p> \n    <p><i>Corollary #1: Get\
  \ the boons quickly!</i> Quite simply: go to the locations with the most boons first,\
  \ using the characters most likely to acquire them. If a location has a lot of blessings,\
  \ send someone with a good Divine skill, such as Kyra; if a location has a lot of\
  \ allies, send someone with good Diplomacy, like Seoni. This way, you can collect\
  \ the good stuff before you fight the bad stuff... and if the game ends early due\
  \ to excellent corralling of the villain, you'll have spent <i>all</i> of your time\
  \ encountering boons instead of banes.</p> \n    <p><i>Corollary #2: Get the boons\
  \ greedily!</i> You can take a step further and go into full-on greed mode: send\
  \ characters who are able to get the boons at a location even if they aren't that\
  \ great at closing the location. This is a calculated risk, because it might keep\
  \ you from winning the game. However, if a character’s deck is really lagging in\
  \ a specific type of boon, it's often a good idea. And, you might get away with\
  \ it and still win if you focus most of the other characters on challenges instead\
  \ of benefits.</p> \n    <p><i>Corollary #3: Consider other benefits of a location.</i>\
  \ Very occasionally, locations will have beneficial special effects that are great\
  \ for a specific character. The Old Light is probably the best example: it gives\
  \ an extra d6 to checks that have the Fire trait, so it's a great option for Seoni,\
  \ who has a power that adds the Fire trait to her combat checks.</p> \n    <div\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Anybody got a light?</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>When choosing\
  \ how to match characters to locations don't use just one criteria; consider all\
  \ of these options!</p> \n    <p><i>Next time:</i> Moving to new locations.</p>\
