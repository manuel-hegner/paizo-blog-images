  \    </div> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Yes, yes, I know. That's not the right\
  \ version of \"horde.\" But hear me out! No army of undead is complete without a\
  \ veritable dragon's trove of minion figures to inundate the battlefield with. So\
  \ while the minis represent a horde of undead, you, dear reader, are going to amass\
  \ a hoard of these phenomenal figures from the forthcoming <a href=\"/products/btq01xdi?Pathfinder-Battles-Ruins-of-Lastwall\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Battles: Ruins of Lastwall</i></a> set from WizKids (now due out\
  \ in May).</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20190226-Half-Page.jpg\"\

  ></a> \n     <p><i>Illustration by Vlada Hladkova</i></p>\n    </div> \n    <p>We've\
  \ already looked at the Skeletal Speaker figure, but it's not the only skeleton\
  \ in the set. No, there are two more to form the backbone of your undead army. Here\
  \ we have the Skeletal Samurai and Skeletal Soldier, Medium uncommon and common\
  \ figures, respectively.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20190226-SkeletalSamurai.jpg\"\

  \ from the armies of undeath are aquatic creatures, the drowned dead. Well, not\
  \ anymore! The Draugr, a Medium common figure, can also serve as a blue-skinned\
  \ zombie or other walking dead, but is particularly useful when you need the living\
  \ dead to threaten a ship or coastal community.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>While all undead threaten to haunt the dreams of the\
  \ living, only some are native to the Dreamlands themselves. One such example is\
  \ the Lovecraftian horror known as a Leng Ghoul, represented here as a Medium common\
  \ figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20190226-LengGhoul.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Last week I promised one final deity in the series, and\
  \ none seemed more fitting for this set than Arazni, whose history is intertwined\
  \ with the Knights of Ozem and the Whispering Tyrant. It was the dread lich who\
  \ killed her when she was Aroden's herald, known as the Red Crusader, after all.\
  \ Now, she rules the undead nation of Geb in the absence of its ghostly namesake.\
  \ A Medium rare figure, Arazni will be particularly useful to GMs running the Tyrant's\
  \ Grasp Adventure Path, the first adventure of which should be hitting store shelves\
  \ before the end of the month.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\

  \    </div> \n    <p>Among the many artifacts linked to Arazni, none are more infamous\
  \ than the Bloodstones of Arazni, a set of canopic jars holding her innards. Thus,\
  \ when deciding on our final piece of set dressing, we used the image of these jars\
  \ to make a pair of Canopic Jars suitable for any undead tomb. In practice, they\
  \ came back smaller than I would have preferred, even if they are at the correct\
  \ scale. In retrospect, we probably should have cheated their size up a bit and\
  \ grouped them together into a bunch instead of being individual urns.</p> \n  \

  \    <p>Finally, we end our preview series with one of the most requested figures\
  \ in Pathfinder lore. A figure originally made way back in 2005 in metal form in\
  \ <i>Compleat Encounter: The Vault of the Whispering Tyrant</i> (the first appearance\
  \ of the iconic lich, long before Pathfinder or Golarion were even a thing), the\
  \ Whispering Tyrant has never had a prepainted plastic iteration. That ends now,\
  \ however, with this Medium rare figure based on the Wayne Reynolds cover of <i>Pathfinder\
  \ Campaign Setting: The Inner Sea World Guide</i>.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Next week, we'll look at the contents of the set's premium\
  \ piece, the Cemetery of the Fallen, with pictures of the final pieces on display\
  \ at New York Toy Fair earlier in the month.</p> \n    <p>Mark Moreland<br> <i>Franchise\
