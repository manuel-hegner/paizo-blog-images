  \ <p>I have never been to <a href=\"/paizocon\">PaizoCon</a>. I have heard many\
  \ stories over a pint from friends who have been. I have wanted to go the past few\
  \ years but it just never worked out, whether it was expenses or work related obligations.\
  \ One of the perks of my job is now I get to go to PaizoCon every year. Of course,\
  \ Erik has told me the only excuse for missing it is if I was dead and the body\
  \ couldn’t be recovered. I promise, you don’t need to twist my arm to be there.\
  \ I am excited to experience my first PaizoCon with many of you. Not only do I get\
  \ to attend, I get to help plan the convention. I can’t begin to tell you how cool\
  \ that is. Every week, I’m working on one preparation or another to help make this\
  \ PaizoCon the best yet. With that in mind, I thought I would share some of what\
  \ is being planned for Pathfinder Society. I need to share some of this excitement\
  \ so I don’t explode.</p> \n   <p>We are scheduling 150 tables of Pathfinder Society\
  \ scenarios over the three days. The response of volunteers to GM was overwhelming.\
  \ We filled all 150 tables in 23 hours and we currently have 22 people on the waiting\
  \ list to step in if someone has to cancel their trip. It looks like I’m not the\
  \ only one excited about this year’s PaizoCon. We’re scheduling every Season 3 scenario\
  \ for PaizoCon over multiple tables. </p> \n   <p>We’ll also be debuting the GM\
  \ 101 Workshop. Georgia Venture-Officers took the initiative late last year to put\
  \ together a program to inform prospective GMs of what they might expect while running\
  \ a Pathfinder Society scenario or sanctioned module. They received excellent feedback\
  \ from participants, shared it with several other Venture-Officers to run in their\
  \ regions, and refined the program. They pitched the idea to me to run it at conventions\
  \ and I thought it was a great idea. This 4- to 5-hour workshop will be broken into\
  \ two parts. </p> \n   <p>The first half includes topics such as how to bring a\
  \ 4- to 5-hour scenario to life, how to make rulings on the fly, how to manage a\
  \ table of complete strangers, how to organize a game day, and how to adapt to players\
  \ doing the unexpected. Participants will circulate between stations to learn and\
  \ practice the skills involved. During the second half, Georgia Venture-Officers\
  \ will reveal the Deck of Many Situations. They will lead a humorously instructive\
  \ game that challenges its players to handle tough GMing situations based on real,\
  \ in-game dilemmas. Participants will have the opportunity to play the parts of\
  \ both the GM and the troublesome players. Judges will offer feedback for each round,\
  \ giving everyone the opportunity to learn. Note that we will also be running GM\
  \ 101 workshops at Gen Con. I prefer that anyone who wants to volunteer to help\
  \ run them at Gen Con attend one of these workshops at PaizoCon.</p> \n   <p>Finally,\
  \ we are returning the Grand Convocation to its rightful place at PaizoCon. There\
  \ will be tiered mini-quests that take an hour or two to complete. There will be\
  \ side events where special Chronicles can be earned. And, according to Major Maldris,\
  \ the Blakros family is planning to make an appearance. It is unclear exactly what\
  \ they want. Major Maldris seemed visibly upset (who can blame him when the Blakros\
  \ are involved) when asked about it, as there have been whispers of bargains, deals,\
  \ marriages and the like that the Blakros family is pursuing.</p> \n   <p>I hope\
  \ to see many of you there and to match faces with messageboard names and avatars.\
  \ I also hope that I can help provide all of you that are attending with your most\
  \ memorable Pathfinder experience to date. I look forward to seeing you all in July.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Oh, I almost forgot one important note. It has been mentioned for several\
  \ years that there would be occasional special events for retired, 12th level PCs.\
  \ The Grand Convocation is the debut of these special, Tier 12+ events.</p> \n \
