  \    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Greetings, Pathfinders! As\
  \ the beginning of the Year of Boundless Wonder approaches in August, we wanted\
  \ to let you know about the changes coming to the Pathfinder Society program. Aside\
  \ from the updates in this blog, we don’t have any other rule changes or alterations\
  \ to the program planned; this year should be quieter on that front, rather than\
  \ the radical changes we’ve had in previous years.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ by Nicholas Phillips</p> \n     </div> \n     <br> \n     <h2>Achievement Points</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>We’re aware that achievement points and GM credits are still not being\
  \ awarded correctly (or at all, in most cases). Tech is aware of the problem and\
  \ is currently reviewing the code to fix this issue. Once it’s fixed, you won’t\
  \ have to do anything but refresh your points to fix the errors. Achievement Points\
  \ can still be spent currently. We hope to have good news on this front very soon!</p>\
  \ \n     <p>At the end of May, we also announced that we would be awarding every\
  \ player a starting player grant of <b>80 Achievement Points</b> for both Pathfinder\
  \ and Starfinder Society. You may use these points to unlock an uncommon ancestry,\
  \ other fun uncommon options, or just as a cushion for a couple of resurrections\
  \ should your low-level character meet with an untimely critical hit. The aforementioned\
  \ issues with Achievement Points are also blocking this grant for a small number\
  \ of users, but that should be fixed shortly as well.</p> \n     <br> \n     <h2>Ancestry\
  \ Boon Changes</h2> \n     <p>With the start of Year 4 comes new adventurers! We’\
  re pleased to announce some updates to the price of ancestry boons based on the\
  \ Society’s adventurers.</p> \n     <p>As a result of the Society’s efforts on the\
  \ Shadow Plane this season, the <b>Fetchling Ancestry</b> boon price will be reduced\
  \ to <b>40 Achievement Points</b>. Additionally, additional recruitment in Oprak\
  \ means that the <b>Hobgoblin Ancestry</b> boon price will be reduced to <b>80 Achievement\
  \ Points</b>. Finally, the price of the <b>Catfolk Ancestry</b> boon will also be\
  \ reduced to <b>80 Achievement Points</b>. We don’t have a great in-story reason\
  \ for this last adjustment, but we wanted to bring this boon in line with similar\
  \ uncommon ancestries from the Mwangi Expanse.</p> \n     <p>All of these changes\
  \ will take effect on <b>July 29, 2022</b>, in preparation for the launch of Pathfinder\
  \ Society Year 4 at Gen Con the following week.</p> \n     <p>With that, I’ll turn\
  \ it over to Mike to talk about some new boons coming to the boon store!</p> \n\
  \     <hr style=\"margin: 15px auto;\"> \n     <p>Hello, Pathfinders! Thinking of\
  \ making a new character? Want to tie your character to recent events in Pathfinder\
  \ Society adventures? We’ve got seven new backgrounds, each of which reflects some\
  \ sort of connection to recent and ongoing Pathfinder Society plots. You don’t need\
  \ to play a specific adventure to earn the backgrounds—they’re open to everyone,\
  \ for the price of 4 Achievement Points each. Maybe you’ll want to pick up one of\
  \ these backgrounds because you enjoyed a Year 3 plot and want to have a character\
  \ tied to that plot, or because you’re about to play some Year 3 content and want\
  \ to give your character an even stronger connection to that content before playing\
  \ it. Or maybe you just think it sounds cool!</p> \n     <p>You’ll find the text\
  \ of these boons behind the spoiler tags below. (They don’t contain heavy spoilers\
  \ for the events of any adventures.) Enjoy!</p> \n     <details> <summary><b>Muesello’\
