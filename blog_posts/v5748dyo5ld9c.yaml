  \ class=\"PTales\"></div></a> \n    <h1>Krunzle the Quick</h1> \n    <p>by Hugh\
  \ Matthews</p> \n    <h2>Chapter Four: Caught</h2> \n    <p>His first awareness\
  \ was of the ache in his ribs, that swelled every time he took a breath. He cursed\
  \ the pain, then thought, <i>No, wait, I'm still breathing. That has to go on the\
  \ positive side of the ledger</i>. He took a deeper breath and groaned, his emotions\
  \ mixed.</p> \n    <p>\"Get up,\" said a voice from somewhere above him: female,\
  \ but without the girlish tone of the amulet-wearer. This was a mature contralto,\
  \ with strong overtones of <i>I am used to being obeyed</i>. Krunzle opened his\
  \ eyes and discovered he was lying on a thick carpet. He recognized the hole in\
  \ the ceiling.</p> \n    <p>A toe nudged his sore ribs—bruised, not broken, he deduced—\
  and the voice said, \"Up.\" </p> \n    <p>From this vantage, she seemed extraordinarily\
  \ tall, an impression that did not diminish when he struggled painfully to his feet\
  \ and found that she still overtopped him so that he had to crane his neck to meet\
  \ her eyes. In doing so he discovered that his neck was joining his ribs in registering\
  \ a complaint of maltreatment. \"Ow,\" he said, rubbing it.</p> \n    <p>She looked\
  \ to be of middle years, except for a face as smooth and ageless as magic could\
  \ make it. She wore a complex headpiece of entwined snakes fashioned from some pale\
  \ metal, inset with eyes of polished opal. Hair the same shade as that of the girl\
  \ in the cell cascaded down onto a robe of pale silk, marked in red and black arcane\
  \ symbols.</p> \n    <p>\"I am Hortenza, and this is my house,\" she said. \"Name\
  \ yourself.\"</p> \n    <p>He did so, without resorting to sleights or subterfuges.\
  \ She did not look the type to enjoy a frivolous puzzle.</p> \n    <p>She studied\
  \ the thief. Krunzle had seen much the same expression on the faces of farmwives\
  \ deciding which chicken would have its neck wrung for the stewpot. As if interested\
  \ in the decor, he looked about him. The room was still windowless; there was one\
  \ exit, besides the one he had made.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\">\n     <a\
  \ href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Hortenza.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Hortenza_360.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n     <br> \"Meddling in the affairs of spellcasters is rarely\
  \ advisable.\"\n    </div> \n    <p>As if she could read his thoughts—and perhaps\
  \ she could—she said, \"The door is locked and the snake is on the roof. He likes\
  \ to take sleeping birds. But he'd rather have you.\"</p> \n    <p>Krunzle thought\
  \ of several things he could say, but none of them seemed likely to profit him.\
  \ He remained silent while she studied him some more. Meanwhile, the geas was urging\
  \ him to escape, and to do so loudly. He focused mentally on the impossibility of\
  \ doing so, and the urge quieted. <i>Thanks to Cardimion for making it discriminating</i>,\
  \ he thought.</p> \n    <p>By now, his new captor seemed to have seen all there\
  \ was to see. She said, \"Baalariot sent you.\" </p> \n    <p>Again, the thief saw\
  \ nothing to be gained by speaking. After a moment, she said, \"Answer.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"I did not hear a question.\"</p> \n    <p>Her hard face hardened further.\
  \ She raised a finger whose nail tapered to a black lacquered point and pointed\
  \ it at him. The air around him crackled and he smelled a whiff of sulfur, then\
  \ he became aware that every bone in his body had suddenly become hot enough to\
  \ scald the flesh that touched it. The pain lasted only moments, but the memory\
  \ of it lingered after she lowered the digit.</p> \n    <p>\"Oh, yes,\" he said,\
  \ \"<i>that</i> question. Indeed, Baalariot sent me.\"</p> \n    <p>\"To steal Galathea.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>His eyebrows knitted themselves in confusion. \"He called it something\
  \ else.\"</p> \n    <p>That brought him a quizzical look. She studied him again,\
  \ then said, \"What, exactly, did he call her?\"</p> \n    <p>Krunzle blinked. <i>Her?</i>\
  \ But he was in no position to offer a correction. \"He called it an apprentice's\
  \ eye.\"</p> \n    <p>As a young student, the thief had never risen to the top of\
  \ any class in literature, history, or philosophy. His was a practical intelligence,\
  \ best expressed through his hands, whose remarkable deftness at eye-bamboozling\
  \ speed had won him his nickname. But his inability to recite even the best-known\
  \ dates and precedents used to win him a certain look from the preceptors at the\
  \ day school, a look that said, <i>Can this oaf really be that much of a thimble-wit?</i></p>\
  \ \n    <p>He was seeing that look again, on the face of the witch. Now she looked\
  \ down at the carpet, where the amulet with the color-changing cabochon lay, the\
  \ polished, uncut stone now green again. The snake's coiled embrace must have pressed\
  \ it to him. Indeed, he suspected the hard stone was responsible for one of the\
  \ bruises on his ribs. The moment he noticed it, he involuntarily stooped and picked\
  \ it up.</p> \n    <p>\"That?\" she said. \"You want me to believe he sent you for\
  \ that?\"</p> \n    <p>The darkening expression on her face told Krunzle that he\
  \ needed her to believe it, because it was the only explanation for his conduct\
  \ that he was able to offer.</p> \n    <p>She was studying him even more closely\
  \ now. \"You're not one of his coterie.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I have never been a joiner,\"\
  \ Krunzle said.</p> \n    <p>\"A hireling?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Not as such.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>She picked up the amulet and held it to him. The green stone turned red.\
  \ \"Ah,\" she said.</p> \n    <p>\"Why does it do that?\" he said.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  It is an apprentice wizard's tool,\" she said. \"It perceives the energies involved\
  \ in magic, and mostly serves to prevent the inexperienced from touching that which\
  \ might do them harm. Right now, it tells me that you have been ensorcelled.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>She tilted her head in thought then added, \"Which might make you dangerous.\
  \ Don't move.\"</p> \n    <p>She went to a cupboard that stood against the wall,\
  \ opened a door, and selected an object from several that were stored there. She\
  \ brought it back and he saw that it was a tube carved from black crystal. She put\
  \ it to her eye and inspected him through it.</p> \n    <p>\"Ah, Baalariot,\" she\
  \ said. \"Always the obvious. Of course it would be Cardimion's Discriminating Geas.\"\
  \ She went back to the cupboard, chose other items from its contents and brought\
  \ them to a table. Then she moved a brazier to the same part of the room and, with\
  \ a mere motion of one hand, ignited its charcoal. She inspected the things she\
  \ had arranged on the table—Krunzle saw scrimshawed ivory, an ebony rod, some old,\
  \ time-worn knuckle bones, a scrap of pale hide tattooed with blue runes, a diminutive,\
  \ oddly shaped skull—then she began to perform actions beyond his comprehension.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"If we were out in the street,\" she said, touching this and elevating\
  \ that, \"I could scarcely make a dent. But I have an arrangement with Our Lady's\
  \ sanctuary next door, and that gives me access to a power that...\" She broke off,\
  \ concentrating while she tapped the black rod a precise three times on the top\
  \ of the skull, then covered the bone with the tattooed skin. The air inside the\
  \ room was suddenly charged with energy. Kunzle felt a crackling in his ears. Then\
  \ she looked over at him and aimed the rod in his direction, saying, \"This will\
  \ probably hurt a little.\"</p> \n    <p><b>Coming Next Week:</b> The final chapter\
