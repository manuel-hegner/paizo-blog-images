  >Navasi grabbed Keskodai and yanked him around the corner, sending him sprawling\
  \ as lasers sliced through the space he’d occupied a moment before. She returned\
  \ fire, then ducked back behind cover and glared at the shirren. “I thought I told\
  \ you to go in disguise!”</p> \n      <p>From the floor, Keskodai looked up at her,\
  \ mental voice radiating confusion. “But I <i>am</i> in disguise.”</p> \n      <p>Navasi\
  \ squinted. “You look exactly the same.”</p> \n      <p>“The same?!” The shirren’\
  s throat-teeth splayed wide in shock. “I took off my headpiece! I <i>shaved my moustache!</i>”\
  </p> \n      <p>Navasi leaned closer. Sure enough, the chitin above his mouthparts\
  \ was smooth. She fought the urge to put her head in her hands, instead settling\
  \ for thrusting her plasma pistol around the corner and firing blind. Doing her\
  \ best to keep her voice level, she said, “I don’t think that was enough.”</p> \n\
  \      <p>“But it’s my signature style! It’s how everyone recognizes me!”</p> \n\
  \      <p>Navasi entertained a brief but deeply fulfilling fantasy of throttling\
  \ the shirren right there. Was it even wrong to strangle a death priest, ethically\
  \ speaking? Wouldn’t sending him to Pharasma be like giving a dance-pop fan the\
  \ chance to meet Sylix the Siren? </p> \n      <p>But the first rule of captaining\
  \ was not killing your own people, even when they really deserved it. Instead, she\
  \ took a calming breath and said, “You’re right—they must have been using advanced\
  \ facial recognition software.” Then she darted her head around the corner.</p>\

  Navasi, the iconic envoy, peeks around the corner of a starship corridor, narrowly\
  \ dodging a yellow energy beam fired by a four-armed security robot at the opposite\
  \ end.\"></a> \n       <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Illustration by Alexander Nanitchkov</p>\
  \ \n      </div> \n      <p>Her fusillade of plasma bolts had produced the desired\
  \ effect—sort of. The gangsters had indeed pulled back out of the line of fire,\
  \ as she’d hoped. But in their place, they’d sent in a security bot. </p> \n   \
  \   <p>Where in the worlds had these lowlifes gotten a patrol-class model? The thing\
  \ stalked toward her with a fluid mechanical gait, mirrored face scanning. </p>\
  \ \n      <p>She wasn’t quick enough. Even as she jerked backward, the robot fired,\
  \ a line of crackling electricity burning down the corridor. It missed her face,\
  \ but her scarf wasn’t so lucky—the artificial lightning burned straight through\
  \ its trailing end, flames curling up from singed threads.</p> \n      <p>“Damn\
  \ it, Keskodai! That’s coming out of your share!” She snapped off another blind\
  \ shot, then cued coms. “Quig! We need evac. Like, yesterday.”</p> \n      <p>“\
  Copy that, fearless leader.” The rat’s voice came smooth and calm. “They see through\
  \ Keskodai’s disguise?”</p> \n      <p>“Advanced facial recognition software,” Keskodai\
  \ said. The priest didn’t even have the grace to sound embarrassed.</p> \n     \
  \ <p>Quig clucked his tongue. “I figured something was up. The bay started swarming\
  \ with Iovan’s thugs—I had to take off to keep them from boarding the ship.”</p>\
  \ \n      <p>“You’re not in the docking bay?” Navasi’s heart lurched. She’d known\
  \ in her heart that escape wouldn’t be easy—there was only one way off this station,\
  \ so of course Iovan and his goons would try to cut them off. But this was a whole\
  \ new level of busted.</p> \n      <p>“Don’t worry, Captain, I’ve got you an alternative.”\
  \ Quig sounded even more self-satisfied than usual, if such a thing were possible.\
  \ “There’s a maintenance lock at the apex of the main dome. I’ll be there in ninety\
  \ seconds.”</p> \n      <p>“The main dome?!” Navasi couldn’t believe what she was\
  \ hearing. “You want us to go <i>back</i> to the casino?” </p> \n      <p>“They’\
  ll never expect it.”</p> \n      <p>“That’s because it’s stupid!”</p> \n      <p>“\
  But it’s <i>our</i> kind of stupid.” Keskodai sounded positively cheerful. He crouched\
  \ in a sprinter’s stance. “Ready when you are, Captain. May Pharasma bless us.”\
  </p> \n      <p>“I’d rather she continue ignoring us.” But Navasi crouched as well.\
  \ “Ready? Go!”</p> \n      <p>They burst from behind the corner, back the way Keskodai\
  \ had come. The security bot was closer now, the emboldened gangsters creeping along\
  \ behind it. Navasi raised her pistols, but even as she fired Keskodai darted forward,\
  \ one hand to his temple. He thrust out with the other, and a wave of invisible\
  \ force blasted outward, bowling bot and thugs backward like they’d been sucked\
  \ out an airlock.</p> \n      <p>Then they were past them, tearing out of the corridor\
  \ and into the grimy little station’s central casino. Glowing game machines and\
  \ tables of crusty-looking spacers and only slightly less crusty courtesans packed\
  \ every available inch, creating a maze of colors and chimes. Above it all rose\
  \ a tall, transparent dome revealing the stars beyond—and the looming shape of her\
  \ own ship as Quig matched the station’s rotation.</p> \n      <p>“There!” Navasi\
  \ pointed to a ladder climbing one of the support struts, then vaulted up onto a\
  \ felt-topped table, scattering chips and holograms. She leapt to the next table,\
  \ then the next, using them like stones in a river crossing, Keskodai hot on her\
  \ heels.</p> \n      <p>They reached the ladder. Behind them, the trail of angry\
  \ shouts grew louder.</p> \n      <p>She climbed. Ten feet up, she looked back and\
  \ realized Keskodai wasn’t following. “Kesk! Come on!”</p> \n      <p>The shirren\
  \ had his head bowed, mouthparts clacking as he prayed aloud. Then he lifted his\
  \ hands to the wall and began to climb, spidering up the dome’s sheer face faster\
  \ than Navasi on her ladder.</p> \n      <p>Well, good for him. Navasi grit her\
  \ teeth and climbed harder. </p> \n      <p>Her back itched, waiting for the bullet\
  \ or laser blast. They were completely exposed out here on the wall, but that was\
  \ part of the point: if they were lucky, nobody would dare shoot at them for fear\
  \ of puncturing the dome and venting the whole place. </p> \n      <p>Of course,\
  \ if they were unlucky, some drunken gangster wouldn’t think of that until it was\
  \ too late. Long-term thinking wasn’t exactly these folks’ strong suit. It all came\
  \ down to luck—appropriate enough for a casino, she supposed.</p> \n      <p>Above,\
  \ Keskodai reached the airlock and cycled it open, clambering inside. Navasi’s shoulders\
  \ burned as the angle of the ladder increased, the dome’s pitch threatening to peel\
  \ her backward off a wall rapidly becoming a ceiling. Leaned back at this angle,\
  \ she could see the bright gleam of the <i>Maiden</i> as Quig nestled it down against\
  \ the hatch.</p> \n      <p>She was almost to the apex now, the ladder nearly horizontal,\
  \ forcing her to hook her ankles around each rung, the floor a dizzying distance\
  \ below. She leaned her head back, concentrating on the hatch.</p> \n      <p>Keskodai’\
  s inverted head popped out of it, the casualness of his climbing magic giving her\
  \ momentary vertigo as her brain tried to convince her that the two of them were\
  \ right-side up, and the rest of the world was upside down.</p> \n      <p>“Faster!”\
  \ he shouted in her brain. </p> \n      <p>On the floor below, something coughed.\
  \ There was a single instant of blurred motion, and then the ladder between them\
  \ exploded in a fireball.</p> \n      <p>Navasi’s hands tore free of the ladder.\
  \ Suddenly she was hanging, arms waving helplessly as she dangled from a foot wedged\
  \ painfully between two rungs.</p> \n      <p>“Captain!” Keskodai was out of the\
  \ hatch in an instant, skittering across the dome’s underside until he reached her.\
  \ He leaned down and she grabbed his hand, letting him aid her in the world’s worst\
  \ abdominal crunch until she could bend double and catch the ladder’s rungs again.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Or what was left of them. Between her and the hatch, the last twenty\
  \ feet of the ladder had been blown completely clear of the wall, nothing left to\
  \ cling to but smooth, transparent polycarbon and jagged shards of white-hot metal.\
  \ </p> \n      <p>Twenty feet or twenty miles, it didn’t matter—the hatch might\
  \ as well be in another star system.</p> \n      <p>Except that next to her, her\
  \ priest stuck to the dome as if he were a magnet.</p> \n      <p>“Keskodai!” she\
  \ shouted. “Can you cast that spell on me?”</p> \n      <p>“I’m sorry, Captain—\
  that was the last of my spells. But I’ve got the next best thing.” He turned, thrusting\
  \ his armored butt in her direction. “Get on my back!”</p> \n      <p>“Your back?”\
  \ She looked at his skinny limbs. “You can’t carry me! We’ll both fall!”</p> \n\
  \      <p>“Maybe!” he chirped. “If so, we’ll go meet the Lady together!” As she’\
  d predicted, he didn’t sound particularly upset at the idea.</p> \n      <p>She\
  \ had a choice, then. She could order him to save himself, to leave her to the gangsters\
  \ or gravity. He might even do it. She was his captain, after all.</p> \n      <p>But\
  \ that would violate the <i>real</i> first rule of captaining: You trusted your\
  \ people. Always.</p> \n      <p>She let go of the ladder and swung out, grabbing\
  \ for his shoulders.</p> \n      <p>The scramble into the hatch was a stomach-churning\
  \ blur, Navasi clinging to the shirren like a baby monkey on its mother’s back.\
  \ But then they were through, the airlock cycling behind them, making one final\
  \ lurch up into the ship’s cockpit to collapse on the floor.</p> \n      <p>“Howdy,\
  \ boss.” Quig swiveled the pilot’s seat to face them. “Where to?”</p> \n      <p>“\
  Anywhere,” Navasi gasped. “Just out of here, please.”</p> \n      <p>“You got it.”\
  \ Quig tapped a command on the console, and the engines engaged. Then he spun back\
  \ sharply, furry eyebrows rising.</p> \n      <p>“Keskodai!” he blurted. “What happened\
  \ to your ’stache?”</p> \n      <p style=\"font-weight: bold; line-height: 14px\"\
