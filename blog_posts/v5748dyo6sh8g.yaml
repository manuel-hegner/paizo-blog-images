  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">“You’ll not believe it,\
  \ my friend,” Gorm says, scratching his nose with one calloused finger. “The world\
  \ is spinning faster than I’ve ever seen it, and I’ve lived through three wars!\
  \ Or is it four? What’s a siege count as?”</p> \n     <p>Gorm’s mule, Muttonchop,\
  \ gives the same exasperated snort that’s been his only response to Gorm’s inquiries\
  \ over the last few weeks.</p> \n     <p>“Stubborn as your namesake and half as\
  \ handsome!” Gorm declares with a smile. “What do you care about the fact that Eliza\
  \ is reopening the Maze of the Open Road not even half a year after becoming the\
  \ unmasked representative of the Decemvirate? Nothing, I suppose.”</p> \n     <p>Gorm\
  \ tightens his knees slightly around Muttonchop’s flanks and swings his lute down\
  \ off his back, casually plucking a jaunty tune with fingers that that quickly prove\
  \ much defter than their blunt shape would imply. “A lady fair with scarlet hair,\
  \ walked through a winding maze / and though her mind was sharp and fine, darkness\
  \ plagued her ways. What do you think, Muttonchop, too trite? I don’t think so either.”\
  \ Slinging the lute back over his shoulder, Gorm quickly retrieves a notepad and\
  \ ink pen from the voluminous pockets of his magical vest, sketching down the lyrics.\
  \ “I suppose the rest shall have to wait until she makes it to Woodsedge and files\
  \ her report. Hope it goes well; she brought some of our finest agents, but the\
  \ Maze of the Open Road isn’t what it used to be. Dark things lurk in the passages\
  \ and the walls between planes are exceptionally thin. Hah! I suppose I don’t need\
  \ to tell the first mule to ever walk on Akiton about the dangers of the maze!”\
  </p> \n     <p>The duo rides in comfortable silence for a few more miles, Gorm occasionally\
  \ humming to himself in cheerful composition, Muttonchop displaying the same stalwart\
  \ silence his dwarven partner had come to expect.</p> \n     <p>“Now, you know what’\
  s going to really need a song, don’t you, Muttonchop?” Gorm asks with a wide smile.\
  \ “That expedition down in the Mwangi! On the trail of a founding member of the\
  \ Pathfinder Society, seeking out secrets lost to the mists of time! B’ah, we should\
  \ have gone with, my friend! What legends might we find ourselves excluded from?”\
  \ Clearing his throat, Gorm begins to sing a new song, slinging his lute back to\
  \ hand and rapping out a percussive rhythm against its wooden face between strummed\
  \ notes.</p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p>\"Across the ocean dark and fierce,\
  \ a legend for to find<br> A trail gone cold, a challenge old, a story lost to time<br>\
  \ Lo the legend marks his steps through swamp and tree and vine.<br> Heed this story!\
  \ Listen well, I’ll tell you something true<br> A legend lost’s a legend still,\
  \ when found it’s something new.\"</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>Gorm hums\
  \ a few more bars while idly strumming the lute before slinging it once more across\
  \ his back and jotting down the new lyrics. As he does so, Muttonchop crests a rise\
  \ in the trail and the sprawling scape of Absalom comes into view. “The City at\
  \ the Center of the World, my friend! Home from Otari at last. With any luck, Dreng\
  \ will be back from his trip down to the sewers and we can swap a few drinks and\
  \ few stories, old and new alike. Assuming I can get that cagey scoundrel to talk.\
  \ Did you know he’s got medals from both the Eagle Knights and the Lion Blades?\
  \ That one has more secrets than any other ten members of the Society rolled together!”\
  \ The dwarf bard and his stoic mule continue along their way, following the road\
  \ to Absalom.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/052020_rindlerainfickle.jpg\"\
