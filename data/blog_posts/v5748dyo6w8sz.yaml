  \ Season approaches (though, let’s be honest, does it ever really end for some of\
  \ us?) and that provides the perfect opportunity for a thematically appropriate\
  \ Humble Bundle! Starting today, and running through October 10, you can pick up\
  \ the <a href=\"https://www.humblebundle.com/books/pathfinder-second-edition-bundle-dead-paizo-inc-books\"\
  >Pathfinder Second Edition Bundle of the Dead</a>, featuring $811 of content, including\
  \ Book of the Dead, the complete six-part Blood Lords Adventure Path (as well as\
  \ the associated Foundry VTT modules), and many more titles to help you bring chilling\
  \ adventures of terror and dread to your face-to-face or digital tables!</p>\n \

  >since 2012</a>. Through programs that serve the game community and the game industry,\
  \ the organization strives to build an environment that fosters and celebrates mental\
  \ wellbeing through games, communities, and workplaces built for thriving.</p>\n\
  \      <p>Take This’ three tentpole programs provide concrete support to people\
  \ who make and play games while uplifting everyone who is part of this community.</p>\n\
  \      <p>The <a href=\"https://www.takethis.org/accelerate/\">Take This Accelerate\
  \ Program</a> is an initiative fueling the next generation of games and mental health\
  \ experts. While supporting the professional development of creators, game developers,\
  \ and researchers, Accelerate is building a critical mass of ethically trained,\
  \ knowledgeable early-career professionals to advance the work of building a game\
  \ industry focused on digital thriving, prosocial interaction, and safety by design.</p>\n\
  \      <p>The <a href=\"https://www.takethis.org/programs/afk-rooms/\">Take This\
  \ AFK Room</a> is a staffed, relaxed space at conventions and events designed for\
  \ anyone who feels overwhelmed and needs a place to regain their calm. It is run\
  \ by local volunteers and clinicians, trained by Take This, to moderate and maintain\
  \ the atmosphere. The program offers education, resources, and a non-therapeutic\

  >Take This Mental Health in Games Awards</a> honors digital and tabletop games which\

  \ normalize mental health challenges, and uplift the mental wellbeing of the game\
  \ community. These awards recognize excellence in compassionate, non-stigmatizing\
  \ portrayals of mental health and mental health challenges in both video and tabletop\

  https://www.takethis.org/2024/03/february-2024-newsletter/\">plea for financial\
  \ support earlier this year</a>. As hard as they’ve worked to make up that gap,\
  \ the organization still needs significant help. Without everyone’s support, Take\
  \ This and all of its impactful programs will cease to exist - <a href=\"https://www.takethis.org/2024/08/take-this-is-in-danger-of-closing-forever/\"\
  >unless they raise $80,000 by the end of September</a>. Luckily, to help them make\
  \ up the gap, <strong>Take This has received a commitment from an anonymous donor\
  \ to match up to $50,000 of all donations made during this month</strong>—including\
  \ from this bundle! So, you can double the impact of your gift just by purchasing\
