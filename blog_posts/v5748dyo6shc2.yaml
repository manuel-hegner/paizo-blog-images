  \    <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\"></p> \n      <h2>OPM Musings</h2> \n      <p\
  \ itemprop=\"description\">Wow. Eleven weeks. That is how long it's been since we\
  \ decided to move PaizoCon online. In those eleven weeks, we’ve organized three\
  \ major online conventions with over 2,700 games. Huge thank yous to all the GMs,\
  \ HQ, and organizing committee volunteers who jumped in to help us bring the program\
  \ online. While we aren’t finished with our online events (Virtually Expo and PAX\
  \ Online are coming up soon), there is a bit of breathing room for us to evaluate\
  \ our methodologies and streamline some best practices. The reality is that we aren’\
  t going to have large in person gatherings for the rest of 2020 and potentially\
  \ into 2021, so we want to establish workable methods to keep our organized play\
  \ programs functioning in our new existence.</p> \n      <br clear=\"all\"> \n \
  \     <p>Again, a HUGE, MASSIVE, GIGANTIC, COLOSSAL thank you to all those who helped\
  \ out at Gen Con and our other online events. We couldn’t do it without you!</p>\
  \ \n      <h2>Scenario Release Schedule</h2> \n      <p>While we hoped the move\
  \ to work from home wouldn’t impact our release schedule, we had to acknowledge\
  \ before Gen Con that we just couldn’t quite hit our aggressive release schedule.\
  \ To save the sanity of all those working on the scenarios, we adjusted our releases\
  \ slightly. This is our current plan through the end of 2020, though of course unforeseen\
  \ issues may mean we have to make adjustments.</p> \n      <ul style=\"list-style-type:none;\"\

  \ #1-98 is a scenario which had a limited release under SFS staff and will now be\
  \ available to GMs meeting certain criteria. We haven’t finalized the qualifiers\
  \ yet, but will do so soon and publish in a future blog.</p> \n      <h2>Sanctioning</h2>\
  \ \n      <p>Last month, the OP team sanctioned the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq023ih?Pathfinder-Advanced-Players-Guide\"\
  ><em>Advanced Players Guide</em></a> and <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq023gd?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Legends\"\
  ><em>Lost Omens: Legends</em></a> for use in the Pathfinder System and updated the\
  \ <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shbu?Character-Options-for-Pathfinder-Society-and\"\
  >Character Options</a> blog accordingly. It is our intention to move this to a full\
  \ webpage, but that’s still in the queue. The team also opened up kobolds as an\
  \ always available ancestry in a <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shaf?The-Scales-of-Fate\"\
  >blog penned by Pathfinder Society developer Michael Sayre</a>.</p> \n      <p>In\
  \ Starfinder news, we also announced sanctioning for <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq022c7?Starfinder-Near-Space\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Near Space</em></a> and the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq023hm?Starfinder-Starship-Operations-Manual\"\
  ><em>Starship Operations Manual</em></a>. Rules for both of these books are available\
  \ in the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/starfindersociety/additional\">Additional Resources</a>.\
  \ We also announced how players can take part in the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shbj\"\
  >Tech Revolution Playtest</a> while earning Organized Play credit.</p> \n      <p>With\
  \ all this new material, you’d think the team would take a break. But no, the team\
  \ is eyeing the next set of sanctioning. We don’t want to list anything specifically\
  \ at this point, but keep an eye on the blogs for more news.</p> \n      <h2>Achievement\
  \ Points (AcP)</h2> \n      <p>We finished the final tech pieces and <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shbg?Achievement-Points-and-Free-RPG-Day\"\
  >rolled out the Achievement Point system</a> for Pathfinder Society (second edition)\
  \ in July. There are still some bugs in the display (quests/bounties count as .25,\
  \ but display as 0 due to whole integer rounding logic) and in calculation (some\
  \ scenarios/quests aren’t giving AcP) that we are working out, but the core pieces\
  \ of the system work and now we can do some refinements.</p> \n      <p>Since it\
  \ is now active, we announced that we intend to move Starfinder Society to AcP at\
  \ the start of Year 4. If you look at your account, you will see the current pot\
  \ is named Achievement Points (PFS2ed). When we do the rollout for Starfinder Society,\
  \ it will be as a new category of Achievement Points - (SFS). So you will earn points\
  \ based on what program you are playing/GMing. </p> \n      <p>We have no intention\
  \ of converting Pathfinder Society (first edition) to Achievement Points. Eleven\
  \ years of program rewards are too much to convert, so we intend to maintain the\
  \ current pot of paper boons for the lifetime of the campaign.</p> \n      <h2>Campaign\
  \ Coins</h2> \n      <p>With all the other moving parts of Gen Con Online, we didn’\
  t give any coins out. Bringing conventions online means we need to rethink how we\
  \ announce coin recipients and change some of our methods. You’ll see some of these\
  \ changes in the next few months. Be assured, we are still recognizing our outstanding\
  \ program volunteers! If you have someone in your area who gives back to your community\
  \ and who you think epitomizes our organized play program, please send an email\
  \ with your recommendation to organizedplay@paizo.com.</p> \n      <h2>Stars/Novas/Glyphs</h2>\
  \ \n      <p>We rolled out our online evaluation program. Venture-captains and regional\
  \ venture-coordinators conducting evaluations can now enter them on the evaluations\
  \ tab of their “My Organized Play” section of <a href=\"http://paizo.com/\">paizo.com</a>.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Individuals who achieved their 4th rank can now see the status of their\
  \ progress to 5th rank.</p> \n      <p>To protect privacy, only Alex and I see the\
  \ list of open evaluations/qualified GMs. We will be reaching out to GMs on that\
  \ list who are eligible for evaluations to help them get games scheduled/put them\
  \ in contact with VCs/RVCs doing evaluations in our online environments.</p> \n\
  \      <h2>Convention Listing</h2> \n      <p>While Covid-19 impacted the physical\
  \ convention scene, we’ve still got a few events running. In-person conventions\
  \ evaluated the conditions in their particular region and may have additional requirements\
  \ for attendees. The shifting climate may necessitate changes on short notice. Be\
  \ sure to check out individual convention websites/social media channels for last\
  \ minute updates! </p> \n      <p>If you don’t see a convention on the list that\
  \ you think should be there, contact the event organizer and ask them to register\
  \ their event for organized play support!</p> \n      <table width=\"90%\"> \n \
