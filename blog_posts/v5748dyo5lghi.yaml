  \ Blade</h2> \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\"\
  >Farnick rode at her side, the squadron of troopers behind them. His head was cleanly\
  \ shaved. No trace of stubble lined his chin. Brea's armor hung heavy on her shoulders,\
  \ the gorget tight against her throat. All was as it should be.</span></p> \n  \
  \  <p>\"Goblins,\" Farnick spat. \"There be no goblins this close to Prophet's Home\
  \ and dwarven lands.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Let us hope not,\" Brea said.</p> \n    <p>\"\
  I pray there are. My steel's sharp and overdue for a taste of goblin blood.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>She smiled, remembering the moment their friendship was forged during\
  \ the war. In truth, she had thought him mad when he dived in front of a blow that\
  \ would have killed her and, instead, shattered his helm and left his ear a tattered\
  \ mess. A stranger and a dwarf, willing to give his life for no other reason than\
  \ she was his superior officer, and he'd been assigned to her command. Several days\
  \ later, Brea had offered a daring tactic to route the enemy, and Farnick was the\
  \ first to volunteer. His trust in her and her bold strategies had saved them both\
  \ more times than she could recall.</p> \n    <p>There was no warrior she would\
  \ rather have at her side.</p> \n    <p>\"Eager for glory, old friend?\" she asked.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Aye, sir, been too little glory in recent years.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  Peace times are not the place for glory.\"</p> \n    <p>He frowned. \"Nor soldiers,\
  \ I fear.\"</p> \n    <p>The land was hilly and thick with scrubgrass. Mountains\
  \ loomed before them like great shadows on the horizon. The closer they traveled\
  \ to the Five Kings, the more the ground dipped and rose. She'd ordered a loose\
  \ formation and doubled the eyes along either side of her squadron.</p> \n    <p>Brea\
  \ had sent Soltez ahead of the group; despite his lingering injury he was her best\
  \ scout. He would not need his sword arm if he remained unseen. And in truth, she\
  \ had never needed his sword, considering how unskilled he was in battle, but his\
  \ eyes were sharp and his intellect honed finer than any blade. She knew he moved\
  \ somewhere in the distance, though she saw only the occasional wave of high grasses,\
  \ which might have been the wind.</p> \n    <p>Thus far there had been no sign of\
  \ unusual goblin activity. There were always some greenies, prowling in packs for\
  \ wayward travelers. But no goblin warband would attack an armed squadron like Brea's.\
  \ Goblins were crazy, but not entirely stupid.</p> \n    <p>\"Will we see greenies\
  \ today, Captain?\" Etrim spoke from behind her. The eagerness in the younger woman's\
  \ voice made Brea feel ancient.</p> \n    <p>\"Perhaps,\" she said.</p> \n    <p>The\
  \ fresh leather of Etrim's saddle creaked. She held the reigns of Soltez's horse\
  \ and guided it alongside of her.</p> \n    <p>\"It will be an honor to fight at\
  \ your side,\" Etrim said.</p> \n    <p>Farnick chuckled. \"Glory and honor both,\
  \ then. ’Tis a good day for dreams.\"</p> \n    <p>Brea said nothing. Her glory\
  \ had faded with the end of the war, and she'd sacrificed any honor she once had\
  \ the moment she laid her heart bare for her lord.</p> \n    <p>The grasses beside\
  \ her stirred. She reached for her longsword and had almost unsheathed it when she\
  \ noticed the unmistakable cap of dark curls that belonged to Soltez.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>\"One or two leagues north.\" Soltez paused to salute her, almost as an afterthought.\
  \ \"A settlement in the clearing of some trees. Seemed empty to me.\"</p> \n   \
  \ <p>\"Seemed empty or is empty?\" Brea asked.</p> \n    <p>\"Is, sir. Abandoned.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>She nodded and motioned to the extra horse that Etrim led. \"Mount\
  \ up, soldier. You've done well.\"</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\">\n     <a href=\"\

  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n     <br> Brea knows all too well the price of royalty.\n \
  \   </div> \n    <p>Soltez struggled to seat his horse one-handed, and Etrim paused\
  \ to help him. They fell back in the formation, two other troopers seamlessly taking\
  \ their places.</p> \n    <p>The scrubgrass gave way to thick underbrush and tall\
  \ trees. Brea was about to call for a dismount to hack a suitable path for the horses,\
  \ but Soltez assured her the clearing was just ahead. They picked their way carefully\
  \ through the brush, mindful of the horses' footing. Then the trees parted like\
  \ a lover’s welcoming arms.</p> \n    <p>\"This is no settlement,\" Brea murmured\
  \ as she passed a lonely, cold campfire. A few logs and thatches of leaves were\
  \ scattered nearby that could have been the remains of crude shelters. But those\
  \ had fallen ages ago.</p> \n    <p>\"’Tis quiet, sir,\" Farnick whispered beside\
  \ her.</p> \n    <p>She took a breath and let her ears register what was missing.\
  \ The wind had died, and no birds chirped in the trees. Something foul and familiar\
  \ drifted in the still air, the rank stench of an old enemy.</p> \n    <p>\"Goblins,\"\
  \ she said, drawing her longsword. \"Ambush! To arms! Ambush!\"</p> \n    <p>From\
  \ the dark depths of the trees, the creatures emerged.</p> \n    <p style=\"text-align:\
  \ center;\">∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n    <p>They were losing. Brea could sense it in the ebb\
  \ and flow of battle. They'd been caught unawares and had no time to form a defensive\
  \ line. Blackjackets collapsed around her. For every trooper that died, several\
  \ enemies went with him. Still, the hobgoblins poured from the shadows, seemingly\
  \ endless in their numbers.</p> \n    <p>She spotted not a single goblin among the\
  \ ranks, only hobs. Scarred, gray-skinned beings that stood of a height to her and\
  \ fought with a brutal single-mindedness. Their arms and armor were not the scavenged\
  \ mish-mash their shorter cousins preferred, but as finely made as those of any\
  \ regiment of soldiers.</p> \n    <p>Of all the vile creatures in the world, Brea\
  \ hated and feared hobgoblins the most.</p> \n    <p>To her left, she heard Farnick\
  \ grunt as he cut down another hob, only to have a new one take its place. The rest\
  \ of her troopers were scattered throughout the clearing, lost in the blur of battle.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"To me!\" she called, slicing a hobgoblin in front of her across the\
  \ throat and urging her horse to trample the next. \"Form rank!\"</p> \n    <p>Horses\
  \ screamed and toppled, throwing troopers to the ground. Metal clanged, and soldiers\
  \ wailed. The stink of hobgoblins and death filled the air.</p> \n    <p>One hob\
  \ lunged at Brea's mare, and she batted his sword aside. The creature growled, cursing\
  \ in its native tongue, and leaped. It caught hold of her horse's mane, attempting\
  \ to swing itself at Brea and dismount her. She kicked it in the chest, but that\
  \ only gave the hobgoblin pause. Her mount bucked, and she struggled to keep the\
  \ mare under control as the hob wrenched the poor thing’s neck with one hand, while\
  \ the other raised a sword to strike.</p> \n    <p>The hob’s blade descended toward\
  \ Brea’s face. Unable to bring her sword up quickly enough to block, she managed\
  \ only to shift her weight. The sword missed her face by a breath and landed squarely\
  \ upon her throat.</p> \n    <p>The gorget sang with the screech of steel scraping\
  \ steel. A spark hit her chin and sizzled. But the blade turned. Her head rattled\
  \ from the impact, though it remained attached to her shoulders.</p> \n    <p>Brea\
  \ rotated her too-slow parry into a slash and stuck the hob in the side. Blood splattered\
  \ both her and her mare. The hob’s grip slackened, and the creature tumbled to the\
  \ ground.</p> \n    <p>She didn't have time to check the gorget for damage or to\
  \ murmur thanks to Deagan for his well-considered gift. Her old friend appeared\
  \ at her side, a comforting presence as her troopers finally made their way toward\
  \ her.</p> \n    <p>\"Just like the old days, sir,\" Farnick shouted over the chaos.\
  \ He laughed as he blocked a blow and kicked a hobgoblin in the head, sending the\
  \ creature sprawling under his horse's hooves.</p> \n    <p>Other troopers gathered\
  \ slowly in a loose crown formation with Brea. Surrounded by her brothers, she could\
  \ think of no better way to die.</p> \n    <p>The hobgoblin swarm blocked them in,\
  \ swiping at their horses. It was not the first time she and Farnick had been outnumbered\
  \ by goblin infantry, and she smiled as a plan formed. </p> \n    <p>\"Farnick,\
  \ do you remember the battle along the Keld?\" she yelled.</p> \n    <p>\"Which\
  \ one, sir?\"</p> \n    <p>\"The one we rode away from, rather than crawled.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>A knowing grin spread across his face. He gave a whoop and spurred his\
  \ horse. Though smaller than the other warhorses in Brea's squadron, Farnick's mare\
  \ barreled through the hobs, parting them like water. Without hesitation, she followed\
  \ in his wake, the other troopers behind her. They sliced a path through their enemy.\
  \ Even a swarm of hobgoblins was no match for heavy cavalry.</p> \n    <p>When they\
  \ reached the end of the hobs, they turned at the tree line. Farnick fanned to the\
  \ left, and Brea went opposite. Another swath of creatures fell under their horse's\
  \ hooves.</p> \n    <p>Finally, a horn sounded. It bleated for the hobgoblins’ retreat.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Ride them down!\" Brea ordered her squadron. Still, a few hobs managed\
  \ to disappear into the woods.</p> \n    <p>When it was over, she counted her remaining\
  \ people.</p> \n    <p>\"Nine,\" she said. \"Nine of thirty.\"</p> \n    <p>Farnick\
  \ limped over to her, his horse lost among the carnage. Aside from the gouge across\
  \ his thigh, he seemed unharmed.</p> \n    <p>\"Three score of hobs, I'd wager,\"\
  \ he said. He stepped on a body, and it grunted. He raised his sword to strike.\
  \ \"An ugly one here, still breathing.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Wait.\" Brea dismounted\
  \ and stood over the hobgoblin. Both of his legs were broken, and a jagged wound\
  \ across his brow wept blood. She crouched before his hideous face, studying it.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Is you,\" the creature said in guttural Common.</p> \n    <p>\"Do you\
  \ know me?\" Brea asked.</p> \n    <p>The hobgoblin laughed, his eyes black pinpricks\
  \ in a bulbous face. \"The female captain. Said you would come. Said you were fierce.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>She inclined her head, suppressing her surprise. \"Who said?\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>He grew quiet. Only his labored breathing and the movements of her soldiers\
  \ as they gathered the dead echoed through the clearing.</p> \n    <p>Brea grabbed\
  \ a broken leg and squeezed. The hobgoblin howled.</p> \n    <p>\"You were waiting\
  \ for us,\" she said. \"Who sent you?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Gold man,\" the hob wailed.\
  \ He reached for his belt, and Brea leaned on his leg.</p> \n    <p>\"Stay still,\"\
  \ she said and grabbed the pouch near his hand. She handed it to Farnick so she\
  \ could keep her attention on the hob.</p> \n    <p>\"Gold man,\" he repeated. \"\
  Please.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Captain?\" Farnick held out his hand.</p> \n    <p>A flash\
  \ of gold drew her eye, and Brea turned to see bloody coins in her friend's palm.\
  \ The face she knew too well, the lines she had traced with her lips and fingertips,\
  \ stared back at her in mockery. Stamped clearly on each coin was the stoic profile\
  \ of her lord, Deagan Callimedes, stained with her brothers' lives.</p> \n    <p\
