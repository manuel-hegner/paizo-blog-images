  >Starfinder</a> has a wide range of high-tech weapons. Cryo guns, plasma weapons,\
  \ lasers, full automatic projectile weapons, grenades, and many more categories\
  \ of high-tech weapons cram the equipment chapter, ready for players to select what\
  \ they need to stay alive in the adventures to come. But as soon as you mention\
  \ that lasers are an option, and that Starfinder is supposed to maintain fair backward\
  \ compatibility with the monsters of Pathfinder, players wonder how a goblin is\
  \ supposed to be any kind of threat to PCs armed with advanced ranged weaponry.\
  \ After all, realistically, a laser has to do more damage than a short sword, right.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Well, in a word, no.</p> \n     <p>Where realism impinges on making\
  \ a fun and robust game, we're more than happy to deviate from realism—but in this\
  \ case, it's not really necessary. Modern real-world laser pointers are lasers,\
  \ for example, and do no damage to speak of when fired at your hand. And while it\
  \ may seem unrealistic for laser pistols and plasma rifles to do low enough damage\
  \ that you can be shot 4 or 5 times before you're in serious risk of death, that\
  \ logic also applies to archaic weapons. It's not hard to make a 1st-level barbarian\
  \ in Pathfinder who can easily survive four blows from a short sword and still be\
  \ conscious. Certainly most people would agree that \"realistically,\" being stabbed\
  \ four times with 18 inches of sharpened steel isn't going to leave anyone in the\
  \ condition where they can just walk away.</p> \n     <p>So, since we know lasers\
  \ (and, by extension, most other energy weapons) can exist at a level where they\
  \ do little to no damage, we can go ahead and make low-powered versions appropriate\
  \ for the threats and foes low-level characters are most likely to encounter, letting\
  \ your character start the game with that laser pistol they've been coveting.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>But of course it wouldn't be any fun to restrict characters to such\
  \ low-powered options forever.</p> \n     <p>Starfinder assumes there is almost\
  \ always a better version of any weapon you can imagine—the trick is convincing\
  \ people to sell it to you (and having the credits to afford it). In many cases\
  \ the most advanced of these weapons don't make sense for rank-and-file troops.\
  \ After all, why would an army buy a single avalanche-class zero rifle, when it\
  \ can buy forty hailstorm-class zero rifles for the same amount of money? Sure,\
  \ the avalanche-class does three times as much damage. But if you have an army to\
  \ equip, it's better to have forty guns doing 2d8 damage than one gun doing 7d8\
  \ damage.</p> \n     <p>Of course there are exceptions to that thinking, including\
  \ elite forces, commandos, assassins, snipers... and player characters.</p> \n \
  \    <div class=\"blurb360\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/Starfinder/20170616-LaserWeapons.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Starfinder/20170616-LaserWeapons_360.jpeg\"></a>\n  \
  \   </div> \n     <p>As characters advance, they'll have the money, and connections,\
  \ to buy more and more powerful versions of their early weapons. To keep this process\
  \ simple, every piece of equipment in the game has an item level. That level has\
  \ no effect on who can use the equipment—if a 2nd-level soldier gets hold of an\
  \ 18th-level banshee sonic rifle, there's no reason he can't use it to full effect—\
  just as a 2nd-level fighter could use a +5 <i>flaming keen vicious bastard sword</i>\
  \ in Pathfinder. But by giving every piece of equipment an item level, we can tie\
  \ numerous rules—including hardness, Hit Points, save DCs, and item creation rules,\
  \ to name just a few—to a single mechanic. Item level is also a useful baseline\
  \ to help determine what gear a character has the licenses, connections, and trust\
  \ to buy. While circumstances and GM fiat can make any adjustment desired, in general\
  \ a player character in a major settlement is free to buy any gear with an item\
  \ level up to his character level +2. This gives characters freedom to decide if\
  \ they are going to focus on just a few pieces of key gear, or do their best to\
  \ have a variety of slightly less-effective options available, without a GM having\
  \ to spend a lot of time checking tables and making availability rolls.</p> \n \
  \    <p>In general, there's no need to upgrade your weaponry at every level (though\
  \ you certainly could if that was exciting for you), but over the course of a character's\
  \ career they are likely to buy better, more dangerous, more powerful versions of\
  \ their weaponry. The azimuth laser pistol is 1st level, and does 1d4 damage with\
  \ an 80 ft. range increment and the ability to set things on fire with critical\
  \ hits. The next lowest level laser pistol presented in the Core Rulebook is the\
  \ corona model at 6th level, which does 2d4 damage. Of course, a player might run\
  \ into a number of other weapon options along the way, ranging from the static arc\
  \ pistol at 2nd level to the thunderstrike sonic pistol at 4th level or the frostbite-class\
  \ zero pistol at 5th level.</p> \n     <p>Of course, for this system to work, feats\
  \ and class features can't be tied to a specific model or level of a specific weapon.\
  \ Instead, everything is geared to work with all the weapons for a specific proficiency,\
  \ or all the weapons of the same category. Weapon Focus, for example, can be applied\
  \ to all small arms, or all longarms, and so on. The soldier's gear boosts tend\
  \ to work with categories of weapons, such as laser accuracy applying to all lasers,\
  \ or plasma immolation working with all plasma weapons.</p> \n     <p>And that's\
  \ not even talking about magic weapons! The <a href=\"/products/btpy88yj?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Core-Rulebook\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em></a> has several pages of weapon fusions, which\
  \ are special magic abilities that can be added to a weapon to gain a bonus in specific\
  \ circumstances, or grant new combat options. For example, the <i>anchoring</i>\
  \ fusion allows a weapon to immobilize a foe on a critical hit, while the holy fusion\
  \ allows a weapon to bypass DR/good and ignore all energy resistance of evil dragons,\
  \ evil outsiders, and evil undead. Fusion can also be placed in fusion seals, special\
  \ weapon augmentations that can be moved from weapon to weapon if you decide to\
  \ change your primary attack preference.</p> \n     <p>Nor does all of a character's\
  \ increase in damage come from buying bigger guns and more powerful melee weapons.\
  \ At 3rd level, every character class grants specialization with all the standard\
  \ weapons the class gives proficiency with. This allows the character to add their\
  \ level to damage dealt (or to add half their level in the case of small arms or\
  \ operative melee weapons, the latter of which have the special property that anyone\
  \ can use their Dexterity rather than Strength to determine their attack bonus).\
  \ And of course class features, feats, and spells can grant further bonuses, depending\
  \ on the choices a player makes while building their character.</p> \n     <p>All\
  \ of this is tied to our rebalancing of combat math to make the game faster and\
  \ simpler, while keeping weapon choice important and keeping the importance of treasure\
  \ acquisition as a feature of the game. It also gives us flexibility when working\
  \ in the weapon creation design space. The various weapon categories mean that characters\
  \ with no access to magic abilities can still pick up weapons that do various forms\
  \ of energy damage; create cones, lines, or explosions; or even stagger, blind,\
  \ stun, or ignite foes. A soldier might decide their primary fighting style is to\
  \ use a big two-handed melee weapon, but still carry a few grenades and a flamethrower\
  \ for situations where they need to affect multiple targets in an area, or just\
  \ deal a different damage type. It also removes the need to constantly chase pure\
  \ accuracy bonuses, since doing more damage in a round is no longer dependent on\
  \ having a 3rd or 4th (or 6th!) attack in a full attack action reliably connect\
  \ with foes.</p> \n     <p>Most of the math and design work behind how Starfinder's\
  \ weapons, attacks, feats, and more isn't particularly obvious to a typical player—\
  quite intentionally—but we've put a lot of time into creating options that work\
  \ well together, and making sure equipment and weapons generally come into play\
  \ right at the point when it's appropriate for characters to access them. Hopefully\
  \ this will allow players to focus less on finding some theoretical perfect combination\
  \ of game elements for effectiveness, and more on interplanetary adventure!</p>\
