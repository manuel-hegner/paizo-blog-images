  \ \n    <p class=\"date\">by Dylan Birtolo</p> \n    <h2>Chapter Three: A Dangerous\
  \ Path</h2> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Marra sat back in the saddle and pulled\
  \ on the reins, bringing her horse to a stop. She slid her hand forward to rest\
  \ on the saddle in what she hoped looked like a natural movement. The truth was\
  \ she wanted to get her hand closer to the sword.</p> \n    <p>She looked up and\
  \ saw two men stepping out from under the tree line, both holding loaded crossbows.\
  \ They were dressed in leather, distinguishable as high quality even from this distance,\
  \ and each wore an emblem of the knights of Lastwall over the left breast. Marra\
  \ swallowed, trying to slow her pounding heart and hoping her voice wouldn't tremor\
  \ and give away her nervousness.</p> \n    <p>\"Who are you and what's your business?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Marra shifted in the saddle and saw both men tense at the motion.\
  \ She didn't dare to lift her hand from the saddle for fear that it might start\
  \ to shake.</p> \n    <p>\"Marra Silvermoon, knight of Lastwall.\"</p> \n    <p>And\
  \ that was it. The lie was told and she wouldn't be able to take it back. Her fingers\
  \ dug into the front of her saddle as the words passed her lips and the silence\
  \ afterward seemed to stretch on to eternity.</p> \n    <p>\"And your business?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"I was sent to catch up with the caravan and support them.\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Another few seconds passed that felt like minutes to Marra. She heard\
  \ her blood pounding in her ears and waited, reminding herself to breathe.</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"Carry on.\" The man waved her forward.</p> \n    <p>The two scouts went\
  \ back under the trees, disappearing as Marra watched. One moment, they were both\
  \ there, and when she blinked, it was as if they had turned invisible. Not wanting\
  \ to stay and push her luck, Marra nudged her horse and continued on the path. She\
  \ resisted the urge to spur him to a gallop and tried to sit straight in the saddle\
  \ while looking relaxed.</p> \n    <p>When she turned around a bend in the road,\
  \ she let out a deep sigh and lifted her hand from the saddle. Wiping the sweat\
  \ back from her brow, she reminded herself that she was committed to this course\
  \ of action. The scouts knew her name—why hadn't she used a fake one?—and retreating\
  \ now would be fatal. Of course, continuing on might prove fatal as well.</p> \n\
  \    <p>No, she couldn't think like that. She needed to be true to her convictions.\
  \ The two scouts believed her without a second thought, so why wouldn't anyone else?\
  \ Besides, it would get easier each time she had to tell the lie. Soon her heart\
  \ would stop pounding. At least, she hoped so.</p> \n    <p>The sun was almost kissing\
  \ the horizon when she saw the knights' encampment on the trail. Two wagons rested\
  \ next to each other and took up most of the road. The knights had tethered their\
  \ horses to the wagons and sat around a fire talking as they cooked some food. Their\
  \ armor was piled up between the two wagons, away from the horses. From this distance,\
  \ Marra couldn't make out the words, but she could smell the meat sizzling and cooking\
  \ over the flames. Her stomach rumbled.</p> \n    <p>No one else stopped her as\
  \ she made her way up to the camp, but all the knights stopped and looked up at\
  \ her as she entered the circle of light thrown by their campfire. She didn't hesitate\
  \ as she swung out of the saddle and walked her horse to an open spot against one\
  \ of the wagons. She kept her back to the light, biting her lip and half-expecting\
  \ someone to yell at her to stop. Before she even started tying the knot for her\
  \ horse's lead, the voices started up again. She grinned. Apparently, it was as\
  \ she had hoped—not all of the knights knew each other. She just might be able to\
  \ pull this off.</p> \n    <p>As she went to go join the campfire and get some food,\
  \ one of the young men came up to her. He wore a plain blue tunic with no markings\
  \ or insignias. Marra noticed that almost half of the men and women around the fire\
  \ were dressed like him. It occurred to her that this was the style of dress for\
  \ the younger members of the group. </p> \n    <p>\"This way. I'll help you shuck\
  \ your armor.\"</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb180\">\n     <a href=\"http://static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-KnightlyMission-Palrion.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"http://static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-KnightlyMission-Palrion_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n     <br> For Palrion, being a squire means having the courage\
  \ to take risks.\n    </div> \n    <p>Marra didn't know what to say so she followed\
  \ the boy as he led her around the back of the wagon. He turned around and stood,\
  \ waiting for her to step close. He gestured out with his arms and Marra did as\
  \ instructed, giving him access to the straps underneath. As he took her out of\
  \ his armor he whispered so that she had to strain to hear him over the noise of\
  \ the others at the fire.</p> \n    <p>\"I know my lord's armor and you're not my\
  \ lord. Did you really think adding a few birds to the leather would fool someone?\
  \ What happened to him?\"</p> \n    <p>Marra felt herself break into a sweat and\
  \ she resisted the urge to squirm or run. She would never be able to escape at this\
  \ point. She settled for shifting her weight from one foot to the other. Her arms\
  \ trembled a little as she held them out, but if it was from nervousness or fatigue,\
  \ even she couldn't say.</p> \n    <p>\"I found him in the woods, dead from a wound\
  \ in his side. Looked like he'd gotten lost. I buried him.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Why\
  \ are you here? You wanna be a knight?\"</p> \n    <p>Marra shook her head. \"No,\
  \ I needed a way to talk to the knights so that they'd listen to me. I'm from here.\
  \ We need help against the Molthuni, but Lastwall won't listen. I thought maybe...\"\
  </p> \n    <p>The squire shushed her with a quick hiss. One of the knights walked\
  \ past the back of the wagons, nodding to the two standing there as she went to\
  \ the far side and disappeared from their view. Marra waited for the squire to speak.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"You know how rough it'll be for you if they find out.\"</p> \n    <p>Marra\
  \ nodded.</p> \n    <p>\"All right, then. Well, you're gonna help me, and I'm gonna\
  \ help you, nice and easy. You need a squire. Every knight has a squire. And since\
  \ I don't have a knight, it's back to scrubbing and horse duty for me. And if what\
  \ you said is true, I won't have a knight when we get back.</p> \n    <p>\"So you'll\
  \ be my knight and I'll be your squire. You need me, or else they're gonna figure\
  \ you out. And once we get back to Lastwall, before you go away, you'll tell the\
  \ commander how helpful I was so I can get a new assignment. Do we have a deal?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>Marra nodded without thinking about the terms of this arrangement.\
  \ She had not even been here for five minutes before someone had detected her ruse.\
  \ Luckily, it was someone who offered to help, and she would need help if she was\
  \ going to survive. </p> \n    <p>\"What's your name?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Marra Silvermoon.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Right, Dame Marra. I'm Palrion, your new squire.\"</p> \n    <p>He\
  \ finished taking off the breastplate and laid it in a pile with the rest of the\
  \ armor. He gestured for her to bend over, so she did and he pulled off her suit\
  \ of chainmail. When she stood back up, he reached out and grabbed both of her shoulders\
  \ with his hands.</p> \n    <p>\"Now listen to me, Dame Marra. You're a lesser knight\
  \ serving under Sir Tarl. That was my knight, the one you found in the woods. That'll\
  \ explain why you've got his symbols etched on your armor, but with your own personal\
  \ touch. It'll also explain why I know you and can squire for you. Got it?\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>She nodded, feeling an immediate sense of relief that eased the tension\
  \ from her body. After making sure they had the story straight, the two of them\
  \ walked back to join the campfire. Palrion walked behind her but stepped in front\
  \ once they got to the circle of light. He waited for a lull in the conversation\
  \ before speaking.</p> \n    <p>\"This is Dame Marra, one of Sir Tarl's knights.\
  \ I told you Sir Tarl didn't abandon us.\"</p> \n    <p>Marra nodded to the other\
  \ men and women at the campfire and they returned the gesture. One of the other\
  \ squires spat into the flames.</p> \n    <p>\"Guess you got lucky, barely missing\
  \ out on scrub duty.\"</p> \n    <p>Laughter infected the group and Marra took a\
  \ seat next to one of the other knights. She took some food that was offered to\
  \ her: a plate of meat still sizzling in its own juices and heavy with spice. As\
  \ she dug into it she listened to the conversation, not wanting to miss any details.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Why do we even need to be here? Can't the locals train themselves or\
  \ something?\"</p> \n    <p>\"I heard we're here to fight orcs.\"</p> \n    <p>\"\
  No one said orcs. Bandits.\"</p> \n    <p>\"We're not here to fight anyone. We're\
  \ supposed to train some people in Tamran so they can train their people to defend\
  \ themselves. Gesture of good faith and all.\"</p> \n    <p>So they weren't here\
  \ to deal with the bandits. Marra's heart sank and she began to tune out the conversation.\
  \ As she thought about it though, she realized that changed her plan very little.\
  \ She still would need to convince the knights that the bandits were a threat, and\
  \ they were Molthuni, not random vagrants. Once she did that, Lastwall would send\
  \ support.</p> \n    <p style=\"text-align: center;\">∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n    <p>The next\
  \ two days were slow and uneventful as the knights neared the southern tip of the\
  \ Fangwood. Their commander, Sir Adarrius, had them turn east into the forest along\
  \ a seldom-used trail. Marra knew of the trail, but she kept that information to\
  \ herself. It would save them several days' travel so that they didn't need to go\
  \ all the way around the forest, but it would also expose them to some of the dangers\
  \ of the Fangwood.</p> \n    <p>As they journeyed on, the forest became eerily quiet.\
  \ Birds no longer burst from the trees above them. Marra's skin crawled at the base\
  \ of her neck and she strained to look around her, but she saw nothing besides the\
  \ trees. The sound of their party moving through the forest blocked out any other\
  \ noise she might have heard. She reached out and grabbed the sword, drumming her\
  \ fingers along the hilt as she tried to discover what put her on edge. Palrion\
  \ lifted an eyebrow when he saw the motion.</p> \n    <p>A horse screamed from the\
  \ front of their party followed by a stream of curses from one of the knights. Marra\
  \ drew her sword, lifting it high and trying to maneuver around the wagons to see\
  \ what had happened. As she drew close to the edge of the path, one of the large\
  \ green mounds of undergrowth surged to life, rising up and towering over her and\
  \ her horse. The animal panicked and reared, dumping Marra out of the saddle.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>She hit the ground and the sword bounced from her grip, coming to rest\
  \ in the dirt just out of reach. The hulking mound took a step forward on rootlike\
  \ legs, reaching out with a cluster of vines and batting the panicking horse to\
  \ the side. Marra heard a crunch over the clamor of the ambush and her horse made\
  \ no more noise.</p> \n    <p>Recovering from the fall, Marra scrambled over and\
  \ curled her hands around the hilt of the blade. She staggered to her feet and held\
  \ the sword out in front of her in both hands, pointed at the creature advancing\
  \ toward her. It was even bigger than legends said it was. The mound raised one\
  \ large arm high above a headlike mass of vegetation and brought it down, trying\
  \ to squash her into the dirt.</p> \n    <p>Marra dove to the side to get out of\
  \ the way, but the armor slowed her movements. The blow clipped her shoulder and\
  \ slammed her into the ground. This time, she managed to hold on to her weapon,\
  \ but all the breath was knocked out of her. She rolled over and hacked with the\
  \ sword, trying to hit the creature's leg. The weapon bounced off of its thick skin.\
  \ It brought its arm down in a second strike, slamming Marra in the center of the\
  \ chest.</p> \n    <p>There was a brief flash as she felt like her chest exploded,\
  \ and then forgiving darkness closed in around her.</p> \n    <p style=\"text-align:\
