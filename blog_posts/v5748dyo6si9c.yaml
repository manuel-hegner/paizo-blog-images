  \ \n      <p>Paizo, publisher of award-winning games <a href=\"https://paizo.com/pathfinder\"\
  >Pathfinder and Starfinder</a>, is partnering with StartPlaying to make it easy\
  \ for new and longtime players to find Pathfinder groups with <a href=\"https://startplaying.games/gm-search\"\
  >seasoned Game Masters</a> hosting everything from campaigns to one-shots. Whether\

  \      </div> \n      <br> \n      <p>“Paizo is excited about this new partnership.\
  \ We’ve designed Pathfinder to be easy to learn, streamlined to play, and offer\
  \ deep character customization starting at level one, with meaningful choices at\
  \ every level. The StartPlaying professional Game Masters are ready to get you started\
  \ and keep you playing every month at Pathfinder Play Weekends,” says Aaron Shanks,\
  \ director of marketing at Paizo.</p> \n      <p>Pathfinder Play Weekend will be\
  \ a recurring event taking place on the last weekend of every month, Thursday to\
  \ Sunday. The first event will run <strong>March 23rd through the 26th</strong>.\
  \ You can <a href=\"https://startplaying.games/search?q=Pathfinder+\">find open\
  \ games here</a>.</p> \n      <p>Pathfinder Second Edition has been <a href=\"https://startplaying.games/blog/posts/this-weeks-ttrpg-news-fans-cast-shield-on-d-d-ogl-1-0\"\
  >leading a TTRPG boom</a> since January of this year. Paizo sold through what was\
  \ planned to be an eight-month supply of the <em>Pathfinder Core Rulebook</em> in\
  \ two weeks. Meanwhile, interest in StartPlaying listings for Pathfinder has increased\
  \ exponentially. Pathfinder Play Weekends will help meet this demand by matching\
  \ eager new players and veteran fans with games for all skill levels. Pathfinder\
  \ 2E offers a variety of gameplay styles and tones, from silly flower garden one-shots\
  \ to deadly dungeon crawls to free-form kingdom building sims.</p> \n      <p>\"\
  We're always excited to make it easy for people to find and play games,\" said Devon,\
  \ StartPlaying co-founder. \"We know the best way to make the hobby grow is to remove\
  \ barriers to entry, and professional Game Masters are incredibly invested in providing\
  \ an amazing experience to players and making them feel welcomed.\"</p> \n     \
  \ <p>StartPlaying games is the premier online platform for finding open TTRPG games\
  \ with professional Game Masters. GM profiles show their skillsets and ratings from\
  \ players, allowing users to easily find someone whose style matches their preferred\
  \ experience. Users can also refer friends to the service to <strong>claim a $10\
  \ credit toward a future game</strong>–perfect for inviting buddies to a new Pathfinder\
  \ campaign!</p> \n     </blockquote> \n    </div> <!-- tags:  Pathfinder, Pathfinder\
