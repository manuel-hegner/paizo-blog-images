  \ Iconics: Sajan</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Monday, March 3rd, 2008</p> \n   <div\
  \ itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p>Birthed to parents of the padaprajna caste\
  \ of warriors in beautiful Vudra, Sajan Gadadvara and his twin sister Sajni learned\
  \ to hold a temple sword before they could walk. Strict padaprajna discipline forged\
  \ a tight bond between the twins, who spent even their infrequent times of rest\
  \ together, practicing the latest martial techniques taught to them. On their twelfth\
  \ birthday, the twins were forcefully separated: Sajan went to live with the fighting\
  \ men of the ghana padaprajna, while Sajni joined the battling women of the sastra\
  \ padaprajna. Despite their separation, the twins continued to meet when they could,\
  \ sparring and joking as they had in their childhoods.</p> \n    <p>As the insightful\
  \ narrative of the <i>Vigrahin Patitraka</i> states, \"A warrior's life is to war.\"\
  \ Thus it was that Sajan's lord embroiled himself in a conflict with a neighbor.\
  \ Most of the army fielded by Sajan's lord consisted of conscripts wielding tools\
  \ of their trades, while the valuable padaprajna watched the battle in reserve.\
  \ The warriors deduced quickly that they stood on the losing side, but they were\
  \ duty-bound to fight to the death when instructed. Instead, their lord stole from\
  \ them the glory of battle-death when he sued for peace after his conscripts fled\
  \ the field. As part of his surrender, the lord gave over half of his sastra padapranja—\
  including young Sajni. </p> \n    <p>Distraught, Sajan returned to his barracks\
  \ in tears (for which he received severe beatings from his own father), and vowed\
  \ that night to be reunited with his sister. Several weeks passed before he found\
  \ his opportunity for escape. He fled into the countryside and slipped stealthily\
  \ into the city of Sumadhadra, through whose gates Sajan watched his sister pass.\
  \ After several days of clumsily seeking information on his sister, he finally discovered\
  \ that all the traded sastra padapranja were loaded onto ships bound for distant\
  \ Jalmeray. </p> \n    <p>Sajan quickly hired himself as a guard aboard a ship bound\
  \ for the far-away island, and several months later he found himself on its heavily\
  \ guarded docks. Within a week, Sajan uncovered the fates of most of the sastra\
  \ padapranja, who worked as guards and courtiers for the island's thakur. Sajni\
  \ was not among them. More weeks passed before Sajan learned that his sister had,\
  \ like him, signed on as a guard aboard a trading ship—hers bound for a place called\
  \ Absalom. </p> \n    <p>The desperate young padapranja gained passage to Absalom\
  \ and, upon arrival, stared in wonder at its size and splendor. It seemed to him\
  \ that the strange western barbarians he found himself among were incapable of a\
  \ place so grand. By the time he found his bearings and rejoined his search, however,\
  \ he found himself without leads, for the sheer size that so impressed him also\
  \ made finding his sister nearly impossible. </p> \n    <p>Sajan knows he cannot\
  \ return to Vudra, for the padapranja there would execute him as a deserter. He\
  \ cares not for his home country, however, and continues to seek out any clue that\
  \ might point him toward his sister. </p> \n    <p> Mike McArtor <br> Editor</p>\
