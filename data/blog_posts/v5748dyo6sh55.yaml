  \ \n       <p>“Sanjaval Spaceflight Systems produces the Palanquin model of heavy\
  \ freighter for a variety of transport applications, but it’s often converted into\
  \ a long-distance high-quality passenger conveyance for regularly traveled space\
  \ lanes. The Palanquin’s several decks provide enough room for spacious guest accommodations,\
  \ which are far enough away from crew quarters that the two groups don’t need to\
  \ mingle in the corridors. With two cargo holds standard, the Palanquin serves as\
  \ a capable freighter for those passengers who are transporting valuable goods to\
  \ far-off reaches.”</p> \n      </blockquote> \n      <p>The full article includes\

  \      <blockquote> \n       <p><i>“You want to know why you’re here? Imagine you’\
  re a brain, yeah? But no eyes, no ears, just sittin’ warm and cozy in your skull\
  \ with nothin’ but imagination and pixie sparkles to keep your attention. You’d\
  \ never need to see how mean the real world is. How it can chew you up and spit\
  \ you out. That’s great for some. But me? If something is about to go pear-shaped,\
  \ I want to know. I like to see the bullet coming. And that’s what we do, kid. We’\
  re not soldiers. We’re not heroes. We watch and we listen, and when we see the bullet\
  \ coming, we tell the brain when to get out of the damn way.”<br> —Donlaia Sekk\
  \ on Training Day 001</i></p> \n       <p>Subterfuge is the exacting scalpel to\
  \ warfare’s indiscriminate shrapnel. And in a galaxy where superweapons can wipe\
  \ out entire planets, a careful hand is infinitely more useful for achieving practical\
  \ goals. Even the most noteworthy interstellar conflict in recent memory— the war\
  \ between the Veskarium and the Pact Worlds—lasted only 5 years before both sides\
  \ shuddered at the mounting cost and devastation of open conflict. But the so-called\
  \ Silent War— focused mainly on smaller skirmishes and espionage—lasted ten generations,\
  \ as dedicated spies and agents on both sides faced off to uncover the other power’\
  s secrets, sabotage their efforts, and sway the direction of their politics.</p>\
  \ \n       <p>Espionage encompasses a number of tactics. A nation conquered by placing\
  \ loyal entities on its throne without a drop of spilled blood can immediately turn\
  \ its engines of commerce to fill your pockets. Quietly bribed researchers can grant\
  \ you access to scientific knowledge. Magical scrying sensors can overhear state\
  \ secrets. Deep cover agents can live among the enemy populace for years and find\
  \ work within government and security organizations. The ultimate goal of espionage\
  \ is to take what your foe can’t afford to lose— knowledge, resources, loyalty from\
  \ their populace, or the lives of key figures—while knowing exactly how they will\
  \ respond.</p> \n      </blockquote> \n      <p>The article includes envoy, mechanic,\
  \ soldier, and technomancer options, as well as three new spells, and is available\
  \ in both print or PDF. </p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"\

  \ ruins and ghosts, by Erik Mona.</p> \n      <blockquote> \n       <p>“By the time\
  \ explorers affiliated with the Pact Worlds first came across the lonely, haunted\
  \ planet of Gadravel on the frontier of Near Space, it was already an ancient graveyard.\
  \ The trench-like scars across Gadravel, visible from space, hint at an ancient\
  \ destruction wreaked by some unknown force or super weapon that also wiped out\
  \ every living thing on the planet. In the decades since its rediscovery, the unquiet\
  \ spirits of Gadravel’s slaughtered populace have swallowed a dozen scientific research\
  \ expeditions and countless opportunists and explorers. Scavengers come in search\
  \ of forgotten technology or unclaimed plunder, while pirates seek refuge among\
  \ the silent streets of abandoned cities, hoping to shake off pursuit by bounty\
  \ hunters. Those who alight on the planet’s surface and leave within an hour or\
  \ two often escape with fantastic riches and intriguing components of baffling alien\
  \ technology. Those who linger too long are devoured by the ghosts and remain on\
  \ the planet for a torturous eternity.”</p> \n      </blockquote> \n      <div class=\"\

  \   <p><i>“Marrax and I noticed the smears of blood on the floor right away. They\

  \ before. Someone stepped forth from the shadows. It looked like Professor Ko, but\
  \ her clothes were tattered and there was some kind of symbol carved into her chest.\
  \ She shuffled forward and grabbed Marrax and slashed at his shirt with long nails.\
  \ I panicked and ran out of there. But Marrax’s wounds began to shift and glow,\
