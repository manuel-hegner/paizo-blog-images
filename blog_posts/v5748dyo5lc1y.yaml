  \ \n  <blockquote> \n   <h1><br>Monkey See, Monkey Do? An FAQ on Intelligent Animals</h1>\
  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, March 29, 2011</p> \n   <p>This is an odd FAQ\
  \ item that we see pop up on occasion in a variety of different places. What happens\
  \ when an animal gets an increased Intelligence score? There are a lot of different\
  \ ways this can happen, and a number of strange routes that a GM could take when\
  \ resolving this issue. Today, we are going to attempt to untangle this particular\
  \ knot and see if we can't come up with some guidelines that make sense.</p> \n\
  \   <p>There are many ways an animal can gain intelligence. It can gain hit dice\
  \ and apply its ability score boost to Int. It can gain the advanced simple template.\
  \ A druid could cast <i>awaken</i> on it. Regardless of the source, an increase\
  \ in Int comes with all of the standard bonuses, such as additional skill points.\
  \ Once a creature's Int reaches 3, it also gains a language. This is where things\
  \ start to get tricky. \"Really, now my pet monkey can talk?\" Well, not really.\
  \ Allow me to explain.</p> \n   <p>Gaining a language does not necessarily grant\
  \ the ability to speak. Most animals do not possess the correct anatomy for speech.\
  \ While a very intelligent dolphin might be taught to understand Common, there's\
  \ no way for him speak it. There is also the issue of learning the language. The\
  \ rules are mostly silent on this front, due to ease of play for PCs, but a GM should\
  \ feel safe in assuming that it might take years to actually teach Common to an\
  \ intelligent animal. All of this, of course, assumes that the animal even bothers\
  \ to fill that language slot. Possessing the ability to use a language does not\
  \ necessarily mean that such an ability is utilized.</p> \n   <p>Another aspect\
  \ of intelligent animals is tool use. There are a number of feats that convey an\
  \ understanding and the proper use of weapons and armor. Generally speaking, these\
  \ feats are off-limits to animals, but when their intelligence reaches 3, the rules\
  \ state that they can use any feat that they are physically capable of using. Some\
  \ people take this to mean that they can equip their animal companion in chainmail\
  \ and arm him with a greatsword given the correct feats. While you could interpret\
  \ the rules in this way, the \"capable of use\" clause is very important. Most weapons\
  \ require thumbs to use properly, and even then, few animals would choose to use\
  \ an artificial weapon in place of the natural weapons that have served them all\
  \ their life. It's what they were born with, after all, and virtually no amount\
  \ of training will change that. In the end, the GM should feel free to restrict\
  \ such choices if he feels that they take away from the feel of his campaign. The\
  \ rules themselves are left a little vague to give the GM the latitude to make the\
  \ call that's right for his campaign.</p> \n   <p>The Handle Animal skill functions\
  \ similarly no matter how intelligent an animal becomes. A character must still\
  \ make Handle Animal checks to train his animal and get him to perform the appropriate\
  \ tasks. A GM should, however, make exceptions in the case of how such an intelligent\
  \ animal might react in absence of instructions. It might not know to unlock a door\
  \ to escape a burning building—as that's a fact that's learned over time and experience—\
  but a smart animal might have a better chance of finding a way out.</p> \n   <p>The\
  \ spell <i>awaken</i> changes much of this, however, since the spell is specifically\
  \ designed to raise a creature up to sentience. GMs should feel free to loosen the\
  \ above guidelines in the case of animals who have been the subject of this spell\
  \ (since they become magical beasts), but should also note that awakened animals\
  \ do not continue to serve as animal companions or familiars. Such creatures gain\
  \ their own desires and feelings, and may seek to set out on their own to determine\
  \ their own fate. They may not leave right away, but GMs should keep in mind that\
  \ eventually any such creatures (or trees) may wish to leave to find their fortune.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Note that while the monster guidelines talk about a maximum Int for an\
  \ animal, this only applies to the creation process. Giving an animal a higher Intelligence\
  \ score does not somehow transform it into a magical beast, unless the effect says\
  \ otherwise, such as in the case of <i>awaken</i>. Animals can grow to have an Int\
  \ higher than 2 through a variety of means, but they should not, as a general rule,\
  \ be created that way.</p> \n   <p>Well, that about wraps up our look at intelligent\
  \ animals. We hope these guidelines and ideas help inform the issue in your game.\
  \ If you have any further questions on the topic, ask them in the comments to this\
  \ blog. Until next time!</p> \n   <p>Jason Bulmahn <br>Lead Designer</p> \n  </blockquote>\
