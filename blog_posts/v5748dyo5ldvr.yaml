  articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">Last Friday, the poor Paizo\
  \ Blog was bereft of a Pathfinder Battles preview on account of yours truly running\
  \ the Pathfinder demo room at PAX Prime. PAX is an enormous Seattle-based convention\
  \ with a primary focus on computer games, which means that the 70,000+ attendees\
  \ are all decked out with the latest trends in wireless gaming and handheld mobile\
  \ devices. This has the side effect of train-wrecking internet access from virtually\
  \ anywhere in the convention, which means no blogging from the show floor.</span></p>\
  \ \n    <p>Thanks for your patience, and I hope you minis fiends out there were\
  \ able to make it through the weekend without a major bout of the DTs.</p> \n  \
  \  <p>Anyway, because you got no previews last week, I wanted to make sure you got\
  \ something big this week. And when I think big, one of the first things that comes\
  \ to mind is the massive sword wielded by our iconic barbarian, Amiri, who just\
  \ happens to star in the new Shattered Star Pathfinder Battles set!</p> \n    <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20120907-Amiri.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20120907-Amiri_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>WizKids really outdid themselves with this figure,\
  \ as they have with all of our iconic characters so far. I originally tried to get\
  \ the company to include Amiri in our first Pathfinder Battles set, <a href=\"/products/btpy8mq6\"\
  >Heroes &amp; Monsters</a>, but WizKids politely declined, saying that the overwhelming\
  \ detail and pointy bits of Wayne Reynolds's original illustration would make it\
  \ impractical to sculpt in plastic. (Incidentally, that's why H&amp;M only has one\
  \ iconic character, whereas all following sets have two).</p> \n    <p>By the time\
  \ Shattered Star came around and WizKids had already proven themselves more than\
  \ capable of handing challenging subject matter, I quietly added Amiri back to a\
  \ set list, and this time they didn't even flinch. Instead they came back with what\
  \ I consider one of the most beautiful figures they've produced to date.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Looking at the figure in hand brings out a lot of awesome details that you\
  \ can't quite make out from the photograph. Amiri's slight sneer, the cracks in\
  \ her armor plates, and the scars on her belly really jump off the figure in an\
  \ awesome way.</p> \n    <p>And yes, she's holding an enormous sword. Don't blame\
  \ us! She stole it from a frost giant, and it's served her very well to date, especially\
  \ when she's raging.</p> \n    <p>I think you guys are going to love her.</p> \n\
  \    <p>But since I said \"big\" in the title of the blog post, it only seems fair\
  \ that I include an actual \"big\" miniature in addition to a regular-sized miniature\
  \ holding a big sword. For that purpose, I've decided to also reveal the Hill Giant!</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20120907-HillGiant.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20120907-HillGiant_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>This sculpt perfectly captures the slack-jawed glory\
  \ of the original hill giant illustration in the <i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i>,\
  \ and continues to round out our offerings of \"core\" giants in prepainted plastic.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Although the Shattered Star Pathfinder Battles set includes lots of specific\
  \ NPCs born out of the Adventure Path itself, it's also a chance for us to include\
  \ plenty of rank-and-file monsters that just happen to be encountered in the course\
  \ of the campaign. This rock-throwing simpleton is just one of the many yet to come.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>But they will, alas, have to wait for future Fridays, as I am all out\
  \ of time!</p> \n    <p>See you next week,</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p>\
