  \ \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Apologies in advance for adding yet another\
  \ COVID-19 email into your inbox, but it’s important that I let you know how the\
  \ coronavirus pandemic is affecting Paizo and what we are doing about it.</p> \n\
  \     <p>As you know, social distancing is the most important way that we, as a\
  \ society, have to fight this new viral threat. Three weeks ago, I started the process\
  \ of shifting almost all Paizo employees from working in our Redmond offices to\
  \ working from home; they will continue to do so until we believe it is safe to\
  \ congregate in our office again. For now, our small-but-valiant warehouse team\
  \ remains in place, shipping orders to both customers and distributors. Even in\
  \ the warehouse, we practice social distancing, staggering work schedules and limiting\
  \ the number of people in each area of the warehouse; if we are given cause to believe\
  \ that their safety is compromised, we will cease warehouse operations until the\
  \ crisis passes.</p> \n     <p>As for the products and packages our warehouse team\
  \ is handling (including products made in China and other countries), the Centers\
  \ for Disease Control and Prevention notes that “In general, because of poor survivability\
  \ of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from\
  \ products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient\
  \ temperatures... Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19\
  \ associated with imported goods and there have not been any cases of COVID-19 in\
  \ the United States associated with imported goods.” (See <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html</a> for more\
  \ information.)</p> \n     <p>Working from home does require Paizo to sacrifice\
  \ some of our normal procedures. Our customer service team can’t answer the phones\
  \ from home, so until we are able to move back to the office, customer service is\
  \ available only by email (customer.service@paizo.com) and via the <a href=\"paizo.com/community/forums/paizo/customerService\"\
  >Customer Service forum</a> on paizo.com. We have also unfortunately had to cancel\
  \ all of our visits to gaming conventions and trade shows for the foreseeable future.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Which brings us to PaizoCon. The safety of our attendees and staff is\
  \ of paramount importance, and we are working closely with our host hotel and monitoring\
  \ local, state, and federal government guidelines on a daily basis. The Washington\
  \ State government is currently prohibiting gatherings of 50 or more people, though\
  \ the timeframe does not yet approach the announced dates for PaizoCon (May 22–\
  25). If the gathering ban or other concerns suggest that we should cancel or postpone\
  \ PaizoCon, we will inform the community as soon as we can.</p> \n     <p>While\
  \ Paizo is currently able to carry on with relatively few issues, many game stores\
  \ are unfortunately at risk of going out of business if the pandemic goes on for\
  \ an extended period of time. If your local store is still open, please help them\
  \ out by buying from them when you can.</p> \n     <p>Please also keep in mind that\
  \ social distancing doesn’t have to mean the end of social gaming. Our partners\
  \ at <a href=\"http://www.fantasygrounds.com/home/home.php\" target=\"_blank\">Fantasy\
  \ Grounds</a>, <a href=\"https://roll20.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Roll20</a>, and\
  \ <a href=\"https://d20pro.com/\" target=\"_blank\">D20PRO</a> provide great tools\
  \ for playing roleplaying games online. Paizo also hosts some great <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/forums/campaigns\"\
  >play-by-post campaigns</a>, so you can practice social distancing and still have\
  \ a great time gaming with your friends.</p> \n     <p>We are at the start of one\
  \ of the more difficult moments in the history of the world. We are going to have\
  \ to help our neighbors, our local businesses, and each other get through this.\
  \ It won’t be easy, but Paizo will be here fighting to keep great RPG products coming\
  \ into your homes. </p> \n     <p>Thank you for your continued friendship and business.\
  \ We will update you when the situation changes.</p> \n     <p style=\"margin-left:\
