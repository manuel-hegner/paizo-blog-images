  \ class=\"PTales\"></div></a> \n   <h1>A Tomb of Winter's Plunder</h1> \n   <p>by\
  \ Tim Pratt</p> \n   <h2>Chapter Two: A Damsel with the Dead</h2> \n   <p>Alaeron\
  \ had been prepared for a violent reaction, and so when Rodrick drew his sword,\
  \ he tossed back a vial of extract—the one he'd planned to use to help him creep\
  \ through the barrow undetected. Rodrick was <i>fast</i>, and Alaeron's preparation\
  \ might have been useless if the man hadn't been standing in the ruin of his dead\
  \ friend, which necessitated careful footing rather than a headlong charge. </p>\
  \ \n   <p>Alaeron shivered as the extract—which tasted strongly of wormwood—took\
  \ effect. The only change from Alaeron's viewpoint was a certain fuzziness around\
  \ his peripheral vision, but Rodrick paused, frowning, and Alaeron moved as silently\
  \ as he could to the far side of the entry chamber. </p> \n   <p>\"Invisibility,\"\
  \ Alaeron said, and Rodrick snapped his head around, looking straight at the spot\
  \ where Alaeron had spoken... which was why the alchemist never stopped moving,\
  \ creeping back and forth as he talked. \"I find it makes conversations with armed\
  \ men more pleasant. I am not here to fight you. I was in the forest gathering botanical\
  \ samples—I'm an alchemist, not a wizard, if you were wondering—when I noticed the\
  \ barrow had been disturbed. I investigated, and heard your friend trigger the trap\
  \ there.\"</p> \n   <p>Rodrick knelt and snuffed out the lantern, plunging the room\
  \ into darkness, except for faint illumination around the door. </p> \n   <p>Alaeron\
  \ moved toward the door, hoping Rodrick would hesitate to approach the light. \"\
  Ah, making yourself just as invisible as I am. That's good. I can tell already you'll\
  \ be a great ally.\" He listened, but heard nothing, not the faintest scrape of\
  \ leather on stone or the clink of shifting chainmail. \"I gather from the blood\
  \ on the barrow door that there was some magical ward your friend's blood was able\
  \ to overcome?\" Only more silence. \"And that, with his death, you feel you cannot\
  \ continue, as you have discovered another warded door? I only came in, you see,\
  \ because I know how you can open that door—\"</p> \n   <p>Something cold touched\
  \ Alaeron's cheek, but he had the strength of will not to flinch. \"Is that a dagger\
  \ blade?\" he said, moving his lips as little as possible when he spoke.</p> \n\
  \   <p>\"It is,\" Rodrick breathed in his ear. \"Tell me how you can open the door.\"\
  </p> \n   <p>\"If your friend's blood is the key... at the risk of being indelicate,\
  \ he still has lots of blood, now more accessible than ever. It would be trivial\
  \ to gather some and use it to loosen the wards.\"</p> \n   <p>The knife moved slightly,\
  \ the flat of the blade against his cheek gradually becoming the stinging edge.\
  \ \"Of course I still have his blood,\" Rodrick said. \"But I don't have his <i>knowledge</i>.\
  \ Only Simeon knew which runes should be daubed with blood—and marking the wrong\
  \ one could set off some horrible trap. But perhaps I can profit from this trip\
  \ anyway. I'm sure some of your potions are valuable.\"</p> \n   <p>Most of Alaeron's\
  \ potions would have no effect on anyone but himself, being fuelled by his own aura,\
  \ and the few that could be used by others didn't have beneficial effects, but Alaeron\
  \ didn't point that out. \"Ah, well, of course,\" he said. \"But I can <i>read</i>\
  \ the runes, so I know where to put the blood.\"</p> \n   <p>After a long moment,\
  \ Rodrick chuckled, and the knife withdrew. While Alaeron tried to decide whether\
  \ or not he could move, the light of the lantern flared anew. \"Prove it,\" Rodrick\
  \ said, crouching by the inner door, sword sheathed, dagger in hand. </p> \n   <p>\"\
  We should formalize our arrangement,\" Alaeron said. \"I will accompany you into\
  \ the barrow, lending my considerable skills to your enterprise, and we will divide\
  \ any relics or treasures we find equally.\"</p> \n   <div class=\"blurb360\">\n\
  \    <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Roddrick.jpg\"><img src=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Roddrick_360.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n \
  \   <br> Rodrick's ethics leave something to be desired.\n   </div> \n   <p>\"That's\
  \ fine, if you can actually get us in.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Move away from the door.\"\
  \ Alaeron knelt and dabbed his handkerchief into a bit of Simeon's readily available\
  \ blood. Rodrick narrowed his eyes. Seeing a bloody bit of rag floating through\
  \ the air, moved by an invisible hand, was probably unsettling. \"Bring the light\
  \ closer,\" Alaeron said, and Rodrick held up the lantern while the alchemist squinted\
  \ at the markings on the door. They were far less weathered on the interior barrier,\
  \ which made them much easier to read.</p> \n   <p>Not that Alaeron could read them,\
  \ really. The language seemed Northern, but the Mammoth Lords and Linnorm Kings\
  \ didn't produce much written work, so Alaeron had never learned their writing.\
  \ But he'd seen the runes Simeon daubed with blood outside, and now he saw the same\
  \ pattern here, on a different part of the door, so he thought it was worth a try.\
  \ It was strange to find Northern runes here, so close to the Inner Sea, and focusing\
  \ on that anomaly was a nice alternative to thinking about how he might soon be\
  \ pulped or fried by a magical trap.</p> \n   <p>But the door swung open at the\
  \ touch of the blood, and Alaeron stepped back, keeping an eye on Rodrick in case\
  \ the man decided to take a stab at Alaeron's invisible kidneys. \"There. Do we\
  \ have an agreement?\"</p> \n   <p>\"All right,\" Rodrick said. \"But only because\
  \ there may be more runes inside that need reading. I get first pick of the loot.\
  \ You get my cast-offs.\"</p> \n   <p>\"I woke up this morning expecting no profit\
  \ beyond a few herbs,\" Alaeron said. \"The prospect of any treasure at all is delightful\
  \ to me.\" He was confident that he could manipulate Rodrick into taking shiny but\
  \ less valuable items. Alaeron filled a vial with more of Simeon's blood, just in\
  \ case there were further wards inside. </p> \n   <p>\"In we go, invisible man.\"\
  \ Rodrick stepped through the opening, lantern in hand. Alaeron followed, keeping\
  \ an eye out for traps. The corridor, just wide enough for two men to go abreast,\
  \ was angled steeply downward, suggesting that much of the barrow was dug into the\
  \ ground, or built into natural caverns. There were faintly glowing lights ahead—\
  luminous crystals or fungi, of the kind cultivated by builders of subterranean lairs.\
  \ \"You don't seem terribly upset by the death or your friend,\" Alaeron said. </p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"What? Oh, Simeon. I see. You're under the impression that I'm a rich\
  \ idiot, like he was.\"</p> \n   <p>That was quite true. The fact that Rodrick knew\
  \ that much was worrisome. Rich idiots were generally so used to being treated like\
  \ brilliant paragons that they never doubted themselves, or expected anyone else\
  \ to doubt them, either.</p> \n   <p>\"I'm not a rich idiot,\" Rodrick said. \"\
  I'm an impoverished genius. I've been posing as a wealthy brat, and cultivating\
  \ Simeon's friendship for weeks. I knew he was wealthy and had poor judgment, which\
  \ meant some opportunity for profit would present itself. When he told me about\
  \ the barrow of his avaricious uncle Brant, crammed with all the pillage Brant was\
  \ too greedy to pass on, I knew that was my target. I convinced Simeon's parents\
  \ to send him to the retreat—he was always sickly. The waters may even have done\
  \ him some good, so at least he died in good health. But I wanted him at the retreat\
  \ because it's so close to the barrow. \"</p> \n   <p>Alaeron recalled that he wasn't\
  \ supposed to know anything about these men, and tried to ask an appropriate question.\
  \ \"But if Simeon was wealthy, why would he agree to go graverobbing with you?\"\
  </p> \n   <p>\"Oh, I lured him into a crooked card game at the tavern in the village\
  \ south of the retreat, run by a man I know called the Ratter. Simon went deeply\
  \ into debt, and his father's rather strict, and wouldn't have approved. I presented\
  \ this as a convenient way of paying what he owed. I didn't expect him to <i>die</i>.\
  \ I was going to play it straight. Why not? Ratter had agreed to split half of Simon's\
  \ payment with me. But now that the poor boy is dead... at least I'll get a good\
  \ price for his horse.\"</p> \n   <p>\"You, sir, are a scoundrel,\" Alaeron said.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"There's no sort better to raid a tomb with,\" Rodrick said. </p> \n\
  \   <p>The corridor turned sharply, and something deeper in the tunnel whimpered.\
  \ Rodrick put down the lantern, raised his dagger, and darted around the corner,\
  \ Alaeron close behind him. </p> \n   <p>In a small alcove in the wall stood a petite\
  \ young woman dressed in a blue-and-white checked dress, her blonde hair disarrayed,\
  \ her face beautiful and smudged with tears, her eyes blue and wide.</p> \n   <p>\"\
  Have you come to save me?\" she said. \"I've been trapped here for so long!\"</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Rodrick lowered his dagger. \"Of course,\" he said. \"How did you come\
  \ to be in this terrible place?\"</p> \n   <p>\"I can't remember.\" She shook her\
  \ head, eyes spilling tears. \"I was alone in the dark, I was so frightened...\"\
  \ She broke down in sobs. </p> \n   <p>\"Would you like to escort her outside?\"\
  \ Alaeron said.</p> \n   <p>Rodrick snorted. \"And leave you creeping through here\
  \ on your own? I think not. We'll both take her.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Please don't fight,\"\
  \ she pleaded. She looked at Alaeron. \"I only wish to be free of this dark and\
  \ terrible place.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Oh, am I visible again?\" Alaeron said. </p> \n\
  \   <p>\"As of a few moments ago,\" Rodrick said. \"I assumed you knew.\"</p> \n\
  \   <p>\"Yes, of course, I was just... distracted.\" Alaeron frowned. Something\
  \ was... wrong. How had this woman gotten sealed inside the barrow? Had it been\
  \ looted before, and then used as a headquarters by bandits with a penchant for\
  \ kidnapping milkmaids? And why didn't any of those questions seem more urgent?</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"I will lead,\" Rodrick said. \"You, my dear, can follow me, and the\
  \ alchemist will bring up the rear—\"</p> \n   <p>\"Oh, no, I'll go last. I don't\
  \ wish to be in the way if there are dangers.\" She eased out of the alcove, sliding\
  \ along the corridor with her back to the wall.</p> \n   <p>\"Duck, alchemist.\"\
  \ Rodrick said it casually. Alaeron acted without hesitation, dropping to the stone\
  \ floor. Rodrick let fly with his dagger and put a hand on his sword. Alaeron scrambled\
  \ to one side and turned to see the beautiful blonde crumpled on the floor of the\
  \ corridor. She'd sprouted a dagger from her left eye socket. </p> \n   <p>\"You\
  \ <i>killed</i> her!\" Alaeron shouted.</p> \n   <p>Roderick drew his sword. \"\
  Yes, of course I did. That was rather the <i>point</i>.\"</p> \n   <p><b>Coming\
