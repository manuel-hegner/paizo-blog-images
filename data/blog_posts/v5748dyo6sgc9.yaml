  \ on to the next part of <em>Doomsday Dawn</em>, entitled \"Red Flags\"! This time,\
  \ a group of new operatives is sent by the Esoteric Order to the Shackles as part\
  \ of a desperate mission to stay one step ahead of the Night Heralds. Once you have\
  \ had a chance to play this adventure, make sure to stop back here and take the\
  \ surveys. Your responses are critical to our understanding of high-level play!</p>\
  \ \n     <p style=\"text-align:center;margin:2rem;\"><a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/PFPlaytestP6PC\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Player Survey</a> | <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/PFPlaytestP6GM\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Game Master Survey</a> | <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/PFPlaytestP6OP\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Open Survey</a></p> \n     <p>We know that the hectic pace has\
  \ been hard to keep up with, but we would like to encourage you to keep playing\
  \ and submitting your playtest results, even if the focus has moved on. As a reminder,\
  \ all of the Doomsday Dawn surveys will remain open through the end of the playtest\
  \ period!</p> \n     <h2>Update 1.5 Is Alive!</h2> \n     <p>Throughout the playtest\
  \ we’ve been gathering a lot of feedback about spells and their relative power level\
  \ in the game, especially regarding how they compare to spells as they were used\
  \ in Pathfinder First Edition. While some of these changes were made to prevent\
  \ problematic situations in play, others were made to help them function more cleanly\
  \ in the new edition’s structure.</p> \n     <p>The survey results are pretty clear\
  \ that we have succeeded in those goals for some areas of spellcasting and fallen\
  \ short in others—sometimes significantly short. Fortunately, because this is a\
  \ playtest, we can make adjustments and get more feedback. As of this update, we\
  \ are increasing the power level of some spells, starting with those that deal damage,\
  \ as they are the easiest ones to adjust, update, and test. Update 1.5 contains\
  \ a list that includes the majority of the damage-dealing spells in the game, revising\
  \ their overall damage values. Fireball, for example, has gone from dealing 6d6\
  \ fire damage to dealing 8d6 fire damage. This doesn’t affect how the spells scale,\
  \ other than to adjust the base value (so a 4th-level fireball spell will deal 10d6\
  \ fire damage).</p> \n     <p>We want to stress that these are not the only changes\
  \ that will be happening to spells between now and the final version of the game,\
  \ but they are the ones that we can most easily present for additional playtesting.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>This update also contains a few other small alterations. While the dying\
  \ rules have been well received since Update 1.3, there are still some improvements\
  \ that might be made. In this update, we’ve changed the saving throw for stabilizing\
  \ when dying to a flat check (DC = 10 + the dying value). We want to stress that\
  \ this is purely a test to see how players respond to this as opposed to the Fortitude\
  \ saving throw with a DC set by the monster. This is a change that we might roll\
  \ back depending on feedback.</p> \n     <p>There has also been a small change to\
  \ Treat Wounds: the DC of the skill check is now set by the highest level of the\
  \ character being treated. This was changed to clear up some odd issues with high-level\
  \ characters having difficulty when healing targets that are of a much lower level.\
  \ Again, Treat Wounds is still very much a rule that we are evaluating, and I think\
  \ it is safe to say that it will probably change in some ways before we see a final\
  \ version.</p> \n     <p>Ready to add these changes to your game? You can download\
  \ the newest update right here!</p> \n     <blockquote>\n      <div class=\"playtest-link\"\

  \ and Changes</h2> \n     <p>There has been some amount of consternation here and\
  \ on other sites about the changes that are being rolled out as part of the updates,\
  \ and what those changes say about the other rules that aren’t included in the updates.\
  \ Right now, to keep the test focused, we are releasing rules updates only for things\
  \ that we feel we can cleanly update and that need more testing, but that is by\
  \ no means the full scope of the changes happing to the game here in the office.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Your feedback has told us a great many things about the game, and we’\
  ve been using that feedback to shape the rules as we move through the process. It\
  \ is important for all of you to understand that even if you don’t see a rule being\
  \ addressed in the updates or we aren’t speaking about it directly on the forums,\
  \ that doesn’t mean it isn’t being modified or reevaluated for the final version\
  \ of the game. As we said at the start of the playtest, every aspect of the game\
  \ is on the table to change, depending on your feedback. Even if some of those changes\
  \ might be too sweeping to implement in the midst of the playtest, we will make\
  \ the changes needed to make the final game the best it can be. We’re excited to\
  \ share what those changes and alterations will be, but the right time for that\
  \ is after we have completed the playtesting process and are certain of what those\
  \ changes will be.</p> \n     <p>Having participated in every open playtest this\
  \ company has ever conducted, I can honestly say that this one has provided us with\
  \ more valuable feedback and insight into how you play than any other test we have\
  \ ever conducted. I am confident that it will show through in the new version of\
  \ Pathfinder.</p> \n     <p>Jason Bulmahn<br> <i>Director of Game Design</i></p>\
