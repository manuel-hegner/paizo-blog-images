  \ #8—Acquiring the Boons</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, April 4, 2017</p>\
  \ \n   <p itemprop=\"description\"><i>This is the eighth installment of our strategy\
  \ blog written by game historian <a href=\"http://erzo.org/shannon/index.phtml\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Shannon Appelcline</a>. You can read all the installments <a\
  \ href=\"/paizo/blog/tags/adventureCardGameStrategy\">here</a>.</i></p> \n   <p>Though\
  \ they're wholly good, boons can be hard encounters to deal with, because you must\
  \ decide how much effort to expend when technically none is required. The catch\
  \ is that you need to acquire <i>some</i> boons for the continued health of your\
  \ deck. Prioritize their acquisition appropriately.</p> \n   <h2>Spend the most\
  \ effort to get cards for your deck</h2> \n   <p>It's worth expending effort to\
  \ get cards that would improve characters' decks, because improving decks is the\
  \ name of the game. This means that you should prioritize the acquisition of cards\
  \ from the current adventure deck, because they're likely to be better than what\
  \ is currently in your group's decks. In addition, you should focus on any cards\
  \ that will benefit <i>your</i> character. You'll know what the gaps are in your\
  \ character's deck—where he's got a surplus of lower-level cards and which cards\
  \ work well with his skills and powers. So it's easy to know when you should expend\
  \ effort.</p> \n   <p>Don't be afraid to discard and even bury cards to get boons\
  \ of this sort. Be careful that you don't expend so many resources that you take\
  \ a chance of losing the game... unless the card is <i>that</i> good, or unless\
  \ you're losing already. In the latter case, go pig-from-hell wild and start expending\
  \ <i>all</i> of your resources to get cool stuff.</p> \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n    <img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6020-PR-PigFromHell_180.jpeg\"\
  \ alt=\"\">\n    <br><i>This card really doesn't have much to do with the topic—\
  we just like saying “Pig from Hell.”</i>\n   </div> \n   <h2>Spend some effort to\
  \ get cards for your hand</h2> \n   <p>It's slightly less worthwhile to expend effort\
  \ to collect boons that might be useful in your current game, but which you don't\
  \ plan to keep. This includes allies and blessings that can give you turns, weapons\
  \ that can let you attack, armor that can protect you, and spells that can do cool\
  \ stuff.</p> \n   <p>How much effort should you spend? That depends on how good\
  \ the card is.</p> \n   <p>For cards that can give you an exploration, like most\
  \ blessings, it's worth spending a single blessing to guarantee (or nearly guarantee)\
  \ its acquisition. Healing might allow you to see the new blessing more than once\
  \ in a game, so at worst it's a break-even and at best it's an extra exploration\
  \ later on. But one blessing should be the limit for a card you won't keep. And\
  \ if you can instead expend a card that isn't worth an exploration (like Aid) or\
  \ recharge a card to help, that's better.</p> \n   <p>For cards that don't give\
  \ you an exploration, it generally <i>isn't</i> worth spending a blessing, because\
  \ you're effectively trading an exploration for it. However, acquiring a decent\
  \ weapon or armor that would be helpful in the short term could be still be worth\
  \ discarding a non-exploration-granting card or recharging something.</p> \n   <p>And\
  \ then you get to the bottom of the heap: cards that don't grant you a turn <i>and</i>\
  \ aren't that great. Don't entirely ignore them; take a look and see if it serves\
  \ a short-term purpose, like filling a gap in your hand. For example, if you don't\
  \ have a weapon and you need a weapon, then it might be worth a minor cost to pick\
  \ it up.</p> \n   <p>Of course, context is always key. If you're going to have to\
  \ stop exploring because you don't have a weapon in your hand, then clearly it's\
  \ worth spending a blessing to get that weapon, but that's a relatively rare case.</p>\
  \ \n   <h2>Spend less effort to get fuel</h2> \n   <p>Some characters can use cards\
  \ for fuel: Lem can cycle them for spell bonuses, Lini can discard them to increase\
  \ her stats, and Amiri can bury cards to get stat bonuses. For these characters,\
  \ <i>all cards are useful</i>. As with any less useful cards intended just for your\
  \ hand, it's probably not worth a blessing to acquire these cards, but it's definitely\
  \ worth some effort. For a character that must <i>bury</i> cards for fuel, like\
  \ Amiri, it's even more worthwhile, because she faces the danger of her deck decreasing\
  \ in size over time (something that Lem rarely worries about).</p> \n   <h2>Spend\
  \ the least effort to get hit points</h2> \n   <p>Remember that every card is, at\
  \ the least, a hit point—something you can discard as damage. Since even the least\
  \ useful card still has some value, it's <i>always</i> worthwhile to pick up a random\
  \ card at no cost (and maybe at the cost of a recharge), even if you plan to throw\
  \ it out at the end of the turn. Don't forget about your reveal and recharge abilities\
  \ even when you're rolling for boons that are pure dross.</p> \n   <h2>Spend at\
  \ least some effort to gain trading stock</h2> \n   <p>If you're playing <i>Mummy's\
  \ Mask</i>, then you have an extra card-sink to think about: traders, who let you\
  \ exchange boons you don't want (of a particular adventure deck number or higher)\
  \ for something better. To avoid wasting this opportunity, make sure your party\
  \ has picked up some extra boons by the time you win a scenario! You don't have\
  \ to worry about this if you're just trading at the Sunburst Market, which has a\
  \ cost of one boon: you'd usually be swapping something in your hand for something\
  \ at the market, so no problem. But, the more specific a trader is, the higher his\
  \ cost. For example, Agymah and Shardizhad require three boons for each of their\
  \ items. Then you should worry!</p> \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    <a href=\"\

  \ alt=\"\"></a>\n    <br><i>You get what you pay for. Corollary: You pay for what\
  \ you get.</i>\n   </div> \n   <p>To ensure that you <i>always</i> have enough trading\
  \ stock for all your characters to trade, you need to have won a number of throwaway\
  \ boons equal to the cost minus one for the trader that each player wants to visit.\
  \ For example, if three players all wanted to visit Shardizhad and a fourth was\
  \ going to the Sunburst Market, they'd need a total of six throwaway cards (plus\
  \ the one each that they will usually be removing from their deck). However, this\
  \ is probably an excessive count, because it's likely that many cards traders have\
  \ to offer won't be any good for you. So, you'll only need enough throwaway boons\
  \ for a few of the characters to trade — which is why trading stock is listed as\
  \ the lowest priority here. If your group as a whole has already won a few non-interesting\
  \ boons, you're probably fine. But maybe you need a few more if you plan to visit\
  \ the more specific traders. However, if you're getting close to winning a scenario,\
  \ and you don't have anything, then <i>spend a little effort to grab some boons</i>\
  \ so that you can take full advantage of the traders at game's end.</p> \n   <h2>Prioritize\
  \ boons over banes</h2> \n   <p>There's a big coda to this priority list of “boons\
  \ to get”: You should generally work to encounter more boons than banes. Some of\
  \ this is already covered in <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ljdt?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Strategy\"\
  >Choosing Location Decks</a> and <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ljf8?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Strategy\"\
  >Moving to New Locations</a>: you might choose to start at a location because its\
  \ boon-heavy, or you might choose to move to a location because a boon is on top\
  \ of a deck. But be aware that you can also manipulate your decks to maximize boons.\
  \ Use Auguries to push monsters and barriers down to the bottom. Use a Magic Spyglass\
  \ to look at the top three cards in a deck, and if they're all banes, find a way\
  \ to reshuffle the deck—perhaps even by leaving a bane undefeated! Mind you, if\
  \ you're playing Mummy's Mask, Trigger cards can make explicit examination more\
  \ difficult, so in that game consider other means to maximize your boons, like moving\
  \ away from a deck when you've cleared out most of the boons. Just remember: To\
  \ acquire boons, you must encounter boons. (Some restrictions may apply; always\
  \ worry about <i>closing</i> locations first!)</p> \n   <p>Next month: Fighting\
  \ the banes.</p> \n   <p>Shannon Appelcline<br><i>Game Historian</i></p> \n  </blockquote>\
