  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Last week, we revealed the\
  \ title for Year 4 of Starfinder Society: <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shlp?Introducing-Starfinder-Society-Year-4\"\
  >Year of the Data Scourge</a>. This week, we wanted to talk a little bit more about\
  \ what we’re doing to kick off the season.</p> \n     <p>One of our most common\
  \ pieces of feedback from players and GMs is that it can be tough to figure out\
  \ where to start new players. Do they play the most recent low-level scenario released?\
  \ The first one of the season? Start at the beginning with 1-01 <em>The Commencement</em>?\
  \ In an effort to make it easier for everyone, as well as refresh some of our older\
  \ program pieces, we’re releasing a three-part Intro series at <a href=\"http://www.paizo.com/paizocon\"\
  >PaizoCon Online</a>. I’ll let Jenny talk a bit about what’s in each Intro scenario\
  \ now.</p> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/bc1b66da-9164-4eb6-8461-fa1df82f4c36/031821_Celita.png\"\

  https://paizo.com/products/btq027nd\"><em>Starfinder Society Introduction #1: The\
  \ First Test</em></a> is an introduction to the Starfinder Society for characters\
  \ of levels 1-2. Brand new players (and GMs!) can learn what the Society is all\
  \ about, as well as experiencing a variety of common encounters found in Starfinder\
  \ Society adventures, by playing this scenario. The best part is that this adventure\
  \ incorporates repeatable elements so that the same players can experience the fun\
  \ again with a different character, making this an evergreen scenario to incorporate\
  \ into your game days and conventions. This adventure is written by Paizo’s own\
  \ Jason Keeley!</p> \n   <p>After players have an introduction to the campaign with\
  \ Intro #1, they are encouraged to play <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq027ne\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society Introduction #2: For the Factions</em></a>. This adventure\
  \ introduces the four major factions (Acquisitives, Dataphiles, Exo-Guardians, and\
  \ Wayfinders) to players and GMs. In this adventure, the PCs complete a short mission\
  \ for each faction and are encouraged to choose a faction they’re interested in\
  \ working with at the end. This adventure is structured similarly to our classic\
  \ Starfinder Society #1-01: The Commencement, but is full of exciting new content\
  \ to tempt our veteran Starfinders as well as new players! This adventure is also\
  \ for characters of levels 1-2, and was written by fan favorite freelancer Kate\
  \ Baker. </p> \n   <p>Finally, get a taste of Year 4 by playing <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq027nf\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society Introduction #3:Year of the Data Scourge</em></a> (also\
  \ known as SFS 4-01). This scenario follows a team of Starfinders returning to the\
  \ Society hub on Absalom Station when a series of digital attacks rocks the Pact\
  \ Worlds. Play as a Starfinder battling their way across a dangerously glitching\
  \ Absalom Station in search of answers, and find out what the Data Scourge event\
  \ is all about! This scenario is written by yours truly, Starfinder Society Developer\
  \ Jenny Jarzabski, and I promise it’ll be a great time. </p> \n   <br clear=\"all\"\

  \ get a new character up to second level and allow them to learn about the Society\
  \ and the current storyline through play. While Intro #1 and #2 are intended to\
  \ anchor this arc for the foreseeable future, we plan to swap Intro #3 out every\
  \ year with the first scenario of the new season, to introduce all players to the\
  \ new season’s metaplot.</p> \n   <p>We hope everyone finds these scenarios both\
  \ exciting and useful! They will launch at <a href=\"http://paizocon.com/\">PaizoCon\
  \ Online</a> at the end of May along with two new Pathfinder Society scenarios and\
  \ the final Pathfinder Adventure Card Society special. We can’t wait for you all\
  \ to see what we’ve been cooking up! </p> \n   <p>Don’t forget to set reminders\
  \ to join the <a href=\"http://knowdirectionpodcast.com/\">Know Direction Network</a>\
  \ on March 24th as they chat with Linda and Alex about PaizoCon Online and info\
  \ on our Organized Play Programs. If you missed Jenny’s interview on Know Direction,\
  \ it will be uploaded soon!</p> \n   <p>Come back next week for a preview of this\
  \ month’s new releases. Until then - Explore! Report! Cooperate!</p> \n   <p style=\"\
