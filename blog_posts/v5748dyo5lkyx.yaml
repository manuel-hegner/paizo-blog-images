  \ Armory</i></a>, can <i>technically </i>exist in a vacuum (space joke!), none of\
  \ them amount to much without a skilled user. The final portion of <i>Armory</i>\
  \ is devoted to new class options, many of which help characters leverage their\
  \ shiny new items to even better effect. Plus there's a new archetype that brings\
  \ the Augmented, a growing cultural movement of self-modification, to any character\
  \ who wants to hack their body to perfection.</p> \n    <p>Envoys get a slew of\
  \ improvisations and expertise talents that make them even stronger team supports,\
  \ granting allies extra actions to quaff serums or reload weapons. They can also\
  \ become even better battlefield medics, demolition experts, and computer whizzes!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Mechanics learn new tricks and even get additional drone mod options:\
  \ you might teach your drone the Barricade feat or install cybernetic or magitech\
  \ augmentations into its chassis. What's magitech, you ask? A new type of augmentation\
  \ with dozens of options, included in <i>Armory</i>!</p> \n    <p>Mystics forge\
  \ a new connection, which introduces two new spells (marked with asterisks) that\
  \ any mystic can learn:</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\">\n     <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/20180726-HumanMystic.jpg\"\

  \ or the ultimate form of self-improvement that drives life towards enlightenment,\
  \ or even a perversion of the natural order undertaken to venerate dread gods. With\

  \ have new revelations, including two new zenith revelations! With one, you can\
  \ transform into a swarm (as the monster subtype) of thousands of flaming pinpoints;\
  \ the other lets you pull a creature outside the confines of space and time. Like\
  \ you do.</p> \n    <p>Soldiers get a new fighting style, called shock and awe,\
  \ that focuses on overwhelming enemies with auditory and visual stimuli. They also\
  \ have a bevy of gear boosts, including ones that enhance their use of disintegrator\
  \ and sniper weapons (and yes—powered armor!).</p> \n    <p>Technomancers score\
  \ new magic hacks (expend a spell slot to forge a magical, grenade-like matrix of\
  \ volatile energy!) and spells (including <i>animate armor</i>, which, yes, can\
