  artist: "one step in a set area beyond that. Spells like darkness reduce the light\
    \ level in a set radius. Deeper darkness can actually make an area so dark that\
    \ not even darkvision can penetrate it. In addition to the changes to domains,\
    \ the turn undead rules have been revised as well. Now called channel energy,\
    \ this ability releases a wave of positive or negative energy in a 30-foot radius.\
    \ When Kyra uses this ability she much choose to heal living creatures or to harm\
    \ undead creatures (in the Beta rules, she could do both simultaneously). If she\
    \ chooses to heal, all living creatures in the area are healed the listed amount\
    \ (4d6 in this case). If she chooses to harm undead, all undead in the area take\
    \ the listed damage (4d6+8 in this case, due to her sun's blessing domain ability),\
    \ but they receive a save for half damage. Evil clerics can use this power in\
    \ reverse, to harm living creatures or heal undead creatures. Kyra also has a\
    \ few feats to enhance her channel energy ability. Improved Channel adds +2 to\
    \ the DC to resist the channel and Selective Channel allows Kyra to exclude a\
    \ number of targets in her area equal to her Charisma modifier. The big change\
    \ here though is the Turn Undead feat. This feat allows Kyra to spend one use\
    \ of her Channel Energy ability to force undead to flee"
