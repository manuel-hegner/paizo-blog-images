  ></a> \n      <br>Hey now.\n     </div> \n     <p>Here's Amiri, our favorite barbarian.\
  \ Hey—no more sideways character cards! In playtests, we enjoyed reading character\
  \ and role cards like <i>all the other cards</i>. Paragraph widths your brain can\
  \ handle. Pretty great.</p> \n     <p>We're using Wayne Reynolds' new iconic art\
  \ for Amiri, <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgiz?Iconic-Evolution-Amiri\">which\
  \ we revealed just this very week</a>. We're proud that the Core Set is the first\
  \ product that will include all 12 of Wayne's new iconic illustrations. (Yes, we\
  \ said 12, not 11 like in Rise of the Runelords. There's a new Alchemist in town,\
  \ and his name is Fumbus. More on him later on.)</p> \n     <p>The first part of\
  \ Amiri's second power, \"Closing your location does not prevent you from exploring,\"\
  \ probably doesn't make a lot of sense to you just yet—we'll come back to that later\
  \ in this blog.</p> \n     <p>Looking at the back of the card, you'll notice that\
  \ the character's flavor text has moved here from the token card. That's because\
  \ we no longer <i>have</i> token cards. Instead, you'll be getting <b>pawns</b>\
  \ for each character, just like the ones in the <a href=\"/store/pathfinder/accessories/miniatures/pawns\"\
  >Pathfinder Pawns</a> line.</p> \n     <p>You may appreciate the clean phrasing\
  \ of \"Melee weapon.\" In previous sets, we would have to say \"a weapon that has\
  \ the Melee trait.\" Using traits as adjectives has value far beyond just making\
  \ wordings more concise, though; we can now more easily use them as qualifiers throughout\
  \ the game. For example, Amiri no longer has to be content favoring just any old\
  \ weapon—she now favors Melee weapons specifically. And since favored cards aren't\
  \ limited to types alone, \"favored card type\" has become simply <b>favored card</b>.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>A change you could easily miss: characters don't have gender traits\
  \ anymore. We've never actually used them anywhere in the game—not even that one\
  \ time where we tried to make a Unicorn that cared—so we banished them to the ashbin.\
  \ You can still figure out a character's gender from the pronouns in the flavor\
  \ text (or not, as the case may be).</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\

  ></a> \n      <br>Enhance is the closest we got to naming a spell \"Share Tattoo.\"\
  \n     </div> \n     <p>Spells and items got a very important overhaul. The most\
  \ significant adjustment is how you recharge them after playing. One of the game's\
  \ roughest edges—ok, it's a rusted razor blade—has been how and when you do that:\
  \ these cards would go into a Schrödinger's cat-like abeyance zone while you finished\
  \ whatever you were doing, then you could finally find out whether it was discarded,\
  \ recharged, or banished. I've been wanting to fix this hiccup for years. So one\
  \ day in the office, I quietly said, \"I want to change what 'banish' means.\" Once\
  \ everyone got done checking my forehead for signs of fever, I explained my new\
  \ concept of <b>recovery</b>.</p> \n     <p>You will notice that Enhance gets banished\
  \ when you're done using it; that's because all spells get banished now. But when\
  \ you banish a recoverable boon for its power, you don't put it back in the vault—\
  you put it into a <b>recovery pile</b>. At the end of each turn, anyone with a card\
  \ in a recovery pile does whatever that \"During Recovery\" section says. Usually,\
  \ this means applying your proficiencies and/or succeeding at a check to allow you\
  \ to keep the card. If you aren't able to get your card back during recovery, <em>then</em>\
  \ it goes to the vault. Recovery fixes a lot of the game's worst exploits, so we\
  \ never have to worry about Restoration bollixing things up again.</p> \n     <p>And\
  \ let's talk a bit more about proficiency. Previously, characters were proficient\
  \ with card types, so when a card wanted to know if you were proficient with it,\
  \ it would ask you by naming its card type. For example, a weapon might say \"<i>If\
  \ proficient with weapons</i>, you may add or subtract 3 from your result.\" But\
  \ the first part of Enhance's recovery text just says \"<i>If proficient</i>, discard\
  \ this card.\" That's because there's now more than one way to be proficient with\
  \ a card—in addition to being proficient with its type, you can be proficient with\
  \ any of its traits. For Enhance, this means you're proficient with it if you're\
  \ proficient with spells, or if you're proficient with Magic, Arcane, Divine, or\
  \ even Veteran cards (not that any character is ever likely to be proficient with\
  \ Veteran cards, but hey, you never know).</p> \n     <p>So if you're proficient\
  \ with items, or with Alchemical or Liquid, you can try to recharge that Elixir\
  \ of Energy Resistance. (Don't laugh about the Liquid proficiency, or Drunken Avenger\
  \ Valeros will have words with you. Perhaps not entirely comprehensible ones, but\
  \ words nonetheless.)</p> \n     <p>Also, check out that word <b>freely</b> on Enhance.\
  \ That's an important word. There are new restrictions on how you play boons, most\
  \ notably that the party can collectively play no more than one of each card type\
  \ on each check. We'll talk about that in depth in a later blog, but the key is\
  \ that sometimes we want you to be able to bypass those restrictions. So if you\
  \ play a boon freely, you or someone else can play another of that type.</p> \n\

  ></a> \n      <br>Sonja fit all that on one side of a location card. That’s A++\
  \ graphic design.\n     </div> \n     <p>The first thing we need to explain here\
  \ is \"to close or to guard.\" We used to use the terms \"permanently close\" and\
  \ \"temporarily close\" to mean closing a location either forever or just for the\
  \ brief moment when the villain is trying to escape. But there were significant\
  \ differences between those concepts, often requiring us to do some dancing to ensure\
  \ that it was clear when we wanted something to affect just one of them. So \"temporarily\
  \ close\" has become <b>guard</b>, as it is in <i>Apocrypha</i>, and \"permanently\
  \ close\" is just <b>close</b>. No longer do you have to second-guess whether something\
  \ that affects closing is supposed to affect temporarily closing too.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>The next thing we need to explain is why we're not showing you the backs of\
  \ those locations. Well, there is no back. When you close a location, you don't\
  \ flip it over anymore—you banish it, then everybody there moves to a new location.\
  \ There's no need for a \"When Permanently Closed\" power to appear on the other\
  \ side of the card because there are never closed locations in play. This also means\
  \ that the game cleans itself up as you go—when you win, there will typically be\
  \ a lot fewer cards on the table, allowing you to get on with the next scenario\
  \ that much faster.</p> \n     <p>This is also where Amiri's mysterious \"Closing\
  \ your location does not prevent you from exploring\" power comes in. When other\
  \ characters close their location, they move to a new one but are done exploring\
  \ for that turn. Not Amiri—she can try to power through her new location like a\
  \ raging barbarian should.</p> \n     <p>Let's talk about what it takes to close\
  \ or to guard the Ruin: \"Summon and defeat the <b>danger</b>.\" Every scenario\
  \ lists a danger: one or more specific banes that a wide variety of effects can\
  \ bring into play. This allows us to play up unique thematic elements in each scenario.\
  \ Before, we didn't have a good way to throw lots of skeletons at you during a haunted\
  \ castle scenario, but now we just define the danger as, say, an Ancient Skeleton,\
  \ and it's restless dead till dawn.</p> \n     <p>The Graveyard has a new term:\
  \ <b>new</b>. This just lets us bring in cards from the vault that—unlike summoned\
  \ cards—stick around for more than one encounter.</p> \n     <p>And hey, all locations\
  \ have traits now! Certain banes may be harder to defeat in an Urban location. Or\
  \ you might be a power that serves you better at Wild locations, giving you a reason\
  \ to gravitate toward them. That's a fun bit of storytelling.</p> \n     <p>Then\
  \ there's the <b>proxy</b> card. We've been using proxies in Pathfinder Society\
  \ scenarios for a long time now; bringing that concept to the Core Set means that\
  \ we don't have to include six copies of a bunch of the henchmen. (Even the proxies\
  \ themselves aren't truly duplicates—there are times when it's helpful to differentiate\
  \ between them, so they each bear a unique designation, like our buddy A1 above.)\
  \ This means we can give you more unique cards for your money. Proxies allow us\
  \ to put 411 unique cards in the 440-card Core Set (and the duplicates are all level\
  \ 0 and 1 blessings). It gets even better in the 550-card <a href=\"/products/btq01ws8?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Curse-of-the-Crimson-Throne-Adventure-Path\"\
  ><i>Curse of the Crimson Throne Adventure Path</i></a>, which includes 543 unique\
  \ cards (the duplicates are all of a single level 0 blessing).</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  ></a> \n      <br>These are not the nicest cards we've ever created.\n     </div>\
  \ \n     <p>This trio shows some of the many ways we hurt you. When we hurt you\
  \ in myriad ways, we want to use the same verb, because we often do it multiple\
  \ ways at once. Enter <b>suffer</b>, a word you will learn to loathe. You can suffer\
  \ damage and you can suffer <b>scourges</b>, an evolution of the concept from Mummy's\
  \ Mask. We also named the place you bury your cards the <b>bury pile</b>, which\
  \ might lead you to believe we did so because we used it a lot. Probably don't worry\
  \ about it. For all that suffering, we also coined the verb <b>heal</b> to describe\
  \ the act of shuffling a random card into your deck from your <b>discards</b>—and\
  \ yup, we simplified that to one word too. That'll help when you use the single\
  \ copy of Cure we put in the Core Set. (More unique cards is good, right?) And while\
  \ we're shortening things, \"reset your hand\" became just <b>reset</b>.</p> \n\
  \     <p>We might hurt you <b>before acting</b> or <b>after acting</b>. We changed\
  \ those from \"before you act\" and \"after you act.\" This should make it more\
  \ apparent that these terms describe a time that something happens regardless of\
  \ who actually does it. Castothrane hits you for Fire damage and gives another character\
  \ a Wraith to fight, so it's clear that \"before acting\" can affect more than just\
  \ you.</p> \n     <p>When you try to defeat ol' Ghost Rider here, you might notice\
  \ his <b>immunities</b>, <b>resistances</b>, and <b>vulnerabilities</b>. You can't\
  \ hit him with Cold because he hand-waves that away. Hit him with Fire and you'll\
  \ subtract 4 from your result, because he's resistant. Hit him with Bludgeoning\
  \ and you'll add 4, because Skeletons fold up like deck chairs when bashed with\
  \ rocks. Hit him with a Flaming Mace and both of those apply, so it all washes out.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Oh, maybe the most obvious change: Castothrane isn't a villain or a\
  \ henchman. He's a <b>story bane</b>, which lets him be used as <i>either</i> a\
  \ villain or a henchman. Or as a danger, even. This flexibility lets us use these\
  \ important cards for various purposes, such as Mob of Undead summoning a random\
  \ Undead story bane. This will come in especially handy when you see the random\
  \ scenarios that you can generate yourself.</p> \n     <p>You might be wondering\
  \ about that white circle on the scourge. That's just one place where <b>markers</b>\
  \ come into play. The Core Set includes 63 of these little discs; 7 each of 9 different\
  \ designs. When you suffer a scourge, you put a marker on that circle, and you take\
  \ a corresponding marker yourself. While so marked, that scourge's powers apply\
  \ to you. Scourges can also mark locations, and if you're at a location when it\
  \ gets marked, or if you end your turn at a marked location, you suffer the corresponding\
  \ scourge. Scourges are just one fun thing we do with markers; frankly, we haven't\
  \ even begun to scratch the surface with the possibilities. And wait until we tell\
  \ you what's on the <i>backs</i> of the markers... in another blog.</p> \n     <p>As\
  \ I mentioned last time, we're aware that these changes affect some extant cards.\
  \ The vast majority of cards just work, and the conversion guide in the rulebook\
  \ has simple rules that cover many more. For example, characters that have the Arcane\
  \ or Divine skill count as being proficient with the corresponding trait—easy. A\
  \ single sentence tells you how to play old rechargeable boons with the new recovery\
  \ rules. And another sentence tells you how to easily determine whether effects\
  \ that apply to closing locations should also apply to guarding.</p> \n     <p>A\
  \ few cards will need more specific attention, though. The conversion guide includes\
  \ the general rule that you ignore any effects that involve interacting with closed\
  \ locations, but that might not be good enough for a few cards; when Menhir Savant\
  \ Lini wants to use her Planar Tuning Fork in the General Store, we'll help her\
  \ out. And we might want to give some cards additional powers to increase their\
  \ usefulness in the new set, like letting some cards that currently affect Curses\
  \ and Haunts also affect scourges. Let us know what cards you think need an overhaul.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Basically, you're playing the same game as before, just with a new coat\
  \ of paint. A much spiffier coat of paint, in my totally unbiased opinion. We hope\
  \ you enjoy playing with the new rules as much as we do.</p> \n     <p>Mike Selinker<br>\
