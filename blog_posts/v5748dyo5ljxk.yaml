  \     </div> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">One of the things we were constantly\
  \ considering when designing Starfinder was the balance between magic and technology.\
  \ As a science-fantasy game we want to make sure the impact of magic isn't lost,\
  \ but obviously advanced science is also crucial for the feel of the game. We knew\
  \ we wanted two spellcasting classes (the connection-focused mystic, and the technology-manipulating\
  \ technomancer) to represent the magical elements of the campaign, and everyone\
  \ would have access to technology, but there was a question about who would specialize\
  \ in the nonmagic use of technology. If you wanted to be adept at building, using,\
  \ and modifying technologic devices without relying on magic, what class did you\
  \ play? Our answer is the mechanic.</p> \n     <p>The mechanic has 8 class skills\
  \ and gains 4 skill points per level (though Intelligence is its key ability score,\
  \ so nearly all mechanics will end up with considerably more skill points). It has\
  \ an average attack bonus, good Fortitude and Reflex saves, and a poor Will save\
  \ (toxic gasses and explosions being more common side-effects of failing technology\
  \ than bolts of psychic energy). They have light armor proficiency and grenade proficiency,\
  \ and gain proficiency (and eventually specialization) with basic melee weapons\
  \ and small arms. But beyond those basics, what does a mechanic do? Let's take a\
  \ quick look at what the book itself has to say about the mechanic.</p> \n     <blockquote>\
  \ \n      <p><i>You are a master of machines, from advanced supercomputers to simple\
  \ magnetic engines. Understanding how these devices work gives you insight into\
  \ the world around you, allowing you to make the most of your gear, circumvent hardened\
  \ defenses, and even take over remote systems. Your programming skill also gives\
  \ you the ability to create a powerful ally, in the form of either an implanted\
  \ artificial intelligence or a robotic drone, which can assist you with a variety\
  \ of tasks. If there's a computer or machine that needs to be fixed, bypassed, or\
  \ destroyed, you're the first on the scene. Whether you're a skilled scientist,\
  \ a starship engineer, or a battlefield technician, you're no stranger to combatâ€”\
  but you find it much more reasonable to have your AI or drone do the fighting for\
  \ you.</i></p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>As that description hints, there are\
  \ two types of mechanics, based on what choice a player makes with the 1st level\
  \ mechanic class feature \"artificial intelligence.\" A mechanic selects either\
  \ drone (a partially self-motivated robot companion that can specialize in combat,\
  \ flight, or stealth) or an exocortex. The exocortex is an implanted artificial\
  \ processor that interacts with and augments your brain's cognitive functions, assisting\
  \ in everything from combat to manipulating digital information and even controlling\
  \ additional cybernetic enhancements, and selecting it also grants proficiency in\
  \ heavy armor and proficiency (and eventually specialization) with longarms. As\
  \ the mechanic gains levels, additional modifications and upgrades become available\
  \ for either of these options. At much higher levels, a mechanic can even divide\
  \ his attention between these two options.</p> \n     <p>Even beyond their artificial\
  \ intelligence of choice, mechanics have numerous abilities that help them in the\
  \ use and adaptation of technology. As mechanics gain in levels, they have an increasing\
  \ bypass bonus, adding to their Computers and Engineering checks. They also gain\
  \ a custom rig, a personalized set of tools for hacking and repairs that eventually\
  \ allows the mechanic to make Computers and Engineering checks at range, automatically\
  \ bypass countermeasures and establish encrypted communication lines, and gain the\
  \ same kinds of upgrades and modules as a custom-built computer.</p> \n     <p>In\
  \ addition to their artificial intelligence and customer rigs, mechanics gain broader\
  \ technology-based class features. They can temporarily overload nearly any technologic\
  \ device, temporarily boost the function of armor and weapons, make snap repairs\
  \ to starships, and select from a wide range of mechanic tricks. A mechanic gains\
  \ his first trick at 2nd level, and gains an additional trick (some of which have\
  \ minimum level requirements) every other level after that. Mechanic tricks range\
  \ from using technology to create sudden distractions to special cybernetic implants\
  \ to additional options for the mechanic's artificial intelligence, exocortex, or\
  \ dealing with technology in general. The range of mechanic tricks is wide enough\
  \ to ensure even if you mechanics make the same choice for their artificial intelligence\
  \ class feature, they can operate in very different ways by taking different tricks.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Below is an example of a mechanic trick designed specifically to work\
  \ with the drone option of the artificial intelligence class feature.</p> \n   \
  \  <blockquote> \n      <p><b>Drone Meld (Ex) (8th Level)</b>: As a full action\
  \ while in contact with your drone, you can reconfigure it into a mechanical drone\
  \ suit (or a backpack-like apparatus, for the Tiny hover drone) that you can wear.\
  \ While in this form, the drone can't take any actions or use any of its abilities,\
  \ but you gain either the drone's flight system mods if you have a hover drone,\
  \ reactive camouflage (and an invisibility field if your drone has it) if you have\
  \ a stealth drone, or reductive plating if you have a combat drone. You can end\
  \ the meld and return the drone to its normal form as a full action. Though it normally\
  \ acts on your turn just after you, the drone can take no actions on that turn other\
  \ than transforming back.</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>Owen KC Stephens<br>\
