  \ Society Organized Play, Part 5</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Thursday, June 19,\
  \ 2008 </p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>We know that a pathfinder's loyalties are\
  \ often split between the Society and the nation that birthed them. We ask only\
  \ that you endeavor to keep your interests in discovery and exploration ahead of\
  \ your country's interests. <br> —Venture Captain Alissa Moldreserva</p> \n    </blockquote>\
  \ \n    <p>In Part 1, we unveiled our first faction, Andoran, and spoke a little\
  \ about the faction system we'll use in Pathfinder Society Organized Play. In Part\
  \ 2, we announced our second faction, Cheliax, and we talked briefly about faction\
  \ prestige, how it's earned, and what it means for the world of Golarion as well\
  \ as what it means for you as a member of the Pathfinder Society. In Part 3, we\
  \ revealed the third faction for Pathfinder Society Organized Play: Osirion, Land\
  \ of the Pharaohs. In Part 4, we brought you the fourth faction: Qadira, desert\
  \ frontier kingdom, gateway to the massive continent of Casmaron, and the westernmost\
  \ satrap state of the Padishah Empire of Kelesh. For Part 5, we uncover the final\
  \ faction: Taldor, Golarion's decadent, failing empire with its fingers still gripping\
  \ hard on the shores of the Inner Sea. </p> \n    <p><b>TALDOR</b><br> Decadent\
  \ Failing Empire</p> \n    <blockquote>\n      The sun of Taldor's empire has set.\
  \ It is up to us to see it rise again in our time.\n     <br> —Baron Jacquo Dalsine\n\
  \     <p></p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Old Taldor once ruled the entire northern\
  \ coast of the Inner Sea, from gold gilded Oppara to the wild frontier of Varisia.\
  \ Now it's reduced to a quarter of its former glory. As Old Taldor's gaze turned\
  \ ever inward, its vassals and conquered colonies slowly slipped away without a\
  \ fight. Andoran and Cheliax broke off hundreds of years ago, and few in Taldor\
  \ had either the desire or the motivation to go to war to stop it. Why bother dealing\
  \ with petty trifles in the countryside when your own political destruction is taking\
  \ place in the lime light of Taldorian high society?</p> \n    <p>It's easy to forget\
  \ Taldor's former glory and dismiss the entire country as a band of narcissistic\
  \ fools who spend more time preening their wigs than they do defending their borders\
  \ or quelling the unrest roiling within their great cities. Little do most know\
  \ that while the majority of Taldor's upper crust are more concerned with this season's\
  \ fashions than the well being of their collapsing empire, a few of the world's\
  \ most dangerous operatives are honed in the constant battleground of Oppara's feuds.\
  \ Old enmities between ancient houses have engulfed the Gilded City in shadowy violence\
  \ and assassinations for hundreds of years, and more than a fair share of skilled\
  \ adventurers have come up surviving the feuds, either as hired muscle or scions\
  \ of noble houses mixed up in these simmering cauldrons of bloodshed. </p> \n  \
  \  <p>Taldorians are decadent bon vivants, favoring rich foods, ornate attire, and\
  \ jeweled accoutrements for even the most minor of casual affairs. To a Taldorian,\
  \ appearance is an expression of power, and a keen sense of fashion represents a\
  \ keen mind. Their appreciation for the arts extends beyond fashion and painting,\
  \ dabbling in sorcery, dueling, and the murky strategies of politics and war. A\
  \ Taldorian mind, when raised to ire, is a dangerous thing, and the rest of the\
  \ Inner Sea is about to receive a painful reminder of this timeless fact. </p> \n\

  \ border=\"0\" align=\"right\" hspace=\"9\"></a> \n   <blockquote> \n    <p><b>Goals:\
  \ Get Back in the Game</b></p> \n    <p>Petty differences and ancient feuds have\
  \ slowly ground Taldor down from a great polished stone to a whittled nub. The key\
  \ to restoring the empire's sense of purpose lies in finding an enemy to galvanize\
  \ Taldor's splintered factions, an endeavor worthy of rediscovering the nation's\
  \ august past glory. Seizing the political reins of Absalom is the perfect medicine\
  \ for the wasting disease deep in Taldor's bones. </p> \n    <p><b>Methodology:\
  \ Wolf and Tiger</b></p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>Our weakness must now be our\
  \ strength: centuries of petty infighting have afforded us one weapon – surely there\
  \ is no one who can claim as true a mastery of intrigue as we Taldorians!<br> —\
  Baron Jacquo Dalsine</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Taldor's strategy for seizing\
  \ control of Absalom lies in turning its enemies against one another. Misdirection\
  \ and psychological warfare are the orders of the day. Taldorian missions involve\
  \ sparking old enmities between Qadira and Osirion, driving Cheliax and Andoran\
  \ to rekindle their old war. \"Sick the wolf on the tiger and the hunter's work\
  \ is done\" is an old Taldorian saying, and the mantra by which Taldor's agents\
  \ create havoc around the Inner Sea.</p> \n    <p>Check back in a week to learn\
