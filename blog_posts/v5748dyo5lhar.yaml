  \ itemprop=\"description\">Yesterday brought the sad news that our old colleague,\
  \ Mike McArtor, had passed away. Mike joined the Paizo staff back in the \"magazine\
  \ days,\" as an editor on <a href=\"/dragon\">Dragon Magazine</a>. He was a mainstay\
  \ of office campaigns, a pillar of our editorial operation, and once the magazines\
  \ went away, Mike was one of the earliest architects of Pathfinder and the world\
  \ of Golarion. He left Paizo in 2008, on the eve of the <a href=\"/products/btpy88yj\"\
  ><em>Core Rulebook</em></a> launch, but his creative legacy remains an important\
  \ part of the DNA of the Pathfinder world. His positive attitude and welcoming friendliness,\
  \ I hope, also helped to shape the DNA of Paizo itself. We're a much larger, much\
  \ different company than we were in those now nearly mythical magazine days, but\
  \ we like to think Mike's spirit hung around and continued to influence the company\
  \ years after he left.</p> \n    <p>In recent years, Mike was an editor for Magic:\
  \ The Gathering at Wizards of the Coast. That kept him in the Seattle game professional\
  \ orbit, and many of us found ourselves running into Mike again and again at public\
  \ events and parties. He was always a warm, friendly guy, and it was fantastic to\
  \ see him still working in the field, obviously loving his job.</p> \n    <p>News\
  \ of Mike's death yesterday hit many of us hard, and it wasn't long before some\
  \ of Mike's friends and former colleagues shared some remembrances of his time at\
  \ Paizo and the quality of his character. (Or, in the case of a guy who went through\
  \ at least four characters in our office Age of Worms campaign, the quality of several\
  \ of his characters.)</p> \n    <p>Here are some of those remembrances:</p> \n \
  \   <blockquote> \n     <h3>James Jacobs</h3> \n     <p>I'm still trying to wrap\
  \ my head around the fact that Mike McArtor is gone. Been thinking back on all the\
  \ antics and shenanigans we all got up to back in the early days of Paizo, and I\
  \ realized that Mike was not only one of the first people I ever gamed with at Paizo\
  \ after I started working here... he was also the first Paizo GM I ever had. His\
  \ game was a crazy one—his only real rule was that none of the player characters\
  \ could be humans, because in the campaign he wanted to run, the humans were the\
  \ monsters. We all got to pretty much choose anything we wanted as far as our character's\
  \ race, and he used various books and house rules to help us build the characters\
  \ we thought up... pretty much anything and everything was on the table. Our group\
  \ had, among others, an air elemental, an ogre mage, a gold dragon, and some sort\
  \ of dwarfataur thing (part dwarf, part lion, part beard). My character was Torak,\
  \ an awakened deinonychus who had hopes of some day growing himself a pair of wings\
  \ so he could fly.</p> \n     <p>Mike was instrumental in helping us all make it\
  \ through when we shifted away from the magazines and started working on our own\
  \ brand of products for Paizo. He was one of the three folks who handled the module\
  \ line and the campaign setting line in those days, and in fact he pretty much single-handedly\
  \ got the first hardcover version of the <a href=\"/products/btpy84eo\"><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Chronicles Campaign Setting</em></a> put together—he wrangled all the freelancers\
  \ and handled much of the book's initial developing and editing. He also wrote <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy85ed\">the second installment of the Second Darkness Adventure\
  \ Path</a>—you know, the one where you get trapped in a lighthouse that breaks off\
  \ its foundation and rolls down a hill into the ocean, and oh yeah, the lighthouse\
  \ is filled with alien dog monsters whose bite turns you into zombies?</p> \n  \
  \   <p>But if there was one book I'd have to pick that Mike worked on as my personal\
  \ favorite, that'd hands-down be the <a href=\"/products/btpy81xy\"><em>Guide to\
  \ Korvosa</em></a>. It's still one of my favorite books in the campaign setting\
  \ line; the amount of details he packed into that thing were invaluable in helping\
  \ me build the Curse of the Crimson Throne Adventure Path, and it's a book I still\
  \ reference today whenever I'm looking at designing new cities for the setting.\
  \ While the city of Korvosa itself is from my homebrew setting, and while I was\
  \ originally the one who was going to write the book, it became quickly apparent\
  \ that I wouldn't have time... and Mike brought things to Korvosa that I never would\
  \ have imagined. Things that, today, are what Korvosa is all about. From the little\
  \ things, like the names for coins or those fun little squabbles between imps and\
  \ pseudodragons, all the way up to elements that have become defining and iconic\
  \ staples of our campaign world, like the name Jeggare or the infernal-minded Acadamae\
  \ itself.</p> \n     <p>After I heard the news that he'd passed away, I went looking\
  \ through my computer for any pictures I had of Mike, and it was tough. He never\
  \ did like his picture to be taken, and I mostly respected that by not taking many\
  \ pictures of him... I kinda wish I'd taken more now though. The only two I found,\
  \ though, sum up Mike perfectly.</p> \n     <p>He was cool, and he was just about\
  \ one of the friendliest, most peaceful guys I've ever known.</p> \n     <p>So indeed,\
  \ Mike, my friend.</p> \n     <p>Stay cool, and be at peace.</p> \n     <h3>F. Wesley\
  \ Schneider</h3> \n     <p>Mike and I started at Paizo the same week in 2003, joining\
  \ Dragon magazine as assistant editors. You couldn't have chosen two people with\
  \ more diametrically opposed tastes. We didn't agree on much, but that can be a\
  \ good thing more often than you might think—especially when it comes to telling\
  \ stories. Mike edited the same articles as me for years. Every day I found pages\
  \ covered with his blue notes on my desk, challenging my design, correcting my grammar,\
  \ and suggesting that maybe my articles needed more obscure historical factoids...\
  \ or ninjas... or gnomes. Usually gnomes.</p> \n     <p>Our birthdays were the same\
  \ week, too. When I was new here, Mike guaranteed I never spent a birthday alone.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Mike's most of the reason I know anything about editing. He taught me\
  \ to see the value in other people's passions. He baffled me with how he could make\
  \ friends with anyone. He proved that no matter the game, you can always play a\
  \ ninja. He forced me to accept that some people can wear Micky Mouse sweaters unironically.\
  \ Even now, there's plenty I'd argue with him about, and I doubt either of us would\
  \ ever budge. But, even so, for all the candid corrections, all the enthusiastic\
  \ suggestions, all the contrary perspectives, and all the countless other ways he\
  \ was an honest, accepting, loving guy, I'll always be grateful.</p> \n     <h3>Stephen\
  \ Radney-Macfarland</h3> \n     <p>I never had the opportunity to work with Mike\
  \ McArtor. I worked at Wizards while he was at Paizo, and I was at Paizo during\
  \ his stint with Wizards. But I did game with him, and always enjoyed the way we\
  \ played and sometimes clashed at the table. Over my many years of chucking dice\
  \ and playing roles amid a pile of books and the scattering of miniatures, I've\
  \ found you can learn the measure of a person by gaming with them on a regular basis.\
  \ I can tell you that Mike was one of the kindest, most sincere, and generous people\
  \ I have ever had the opportunity to know. I will always cherish the roles he played\
  \ around the table and the life he lived. Goodbye, my friend. You are missed.</p>\
  \ \n     <h3>Liz Courts</h3> \n     <p>Mike was a sensei. In the very earliest days\
  \ when I stepped into the Paizo board community pool, he was a warm and inviting\
  \ presence. While my first attempts to pitch an article to <a href=\"/dragon\">Dragon\
  \ Magazine</a> died when the license ended, he still encouraged me to continue writing,\
  \ a bit of motivation that later led to the formation of the (now ENnie Award-winning)<a\
  \ href=\"/companies/paizoFansUnited\">Wayfinder</a> fanzine. Without him, the tongue-in-cheek\
  \ appellation of \"gninja\" that I use to this day would not be a thing, and marks\
  \ of his subtle touch are everywhere, in both Pathfinder and in the Paizo community.\
  \ He is sorely missed.</p> \n     <h3>James L. Sutter</h3> \n     <p>Mike McArtor\
  \ was one of the first friends I made at Paizo: a majestic Assistant Editor of <a\
  \ href=\"/dragon\">Dragon</a> who deigned to take notice of a lowly editorial intern.\
  \ Early on, he did me two big favors: the first when he let me write a Class Act\
  \ article—and the second when he quietly killed it rather than let me embarrass\
  \ myself in front of the rest of the staff with my own ignorance.</p> \n     <p>As\
  \ time went on and I joined the editorial team in earnest, Mike and I bonded over\
  \ a lot of things. We co-wrote articles. We formed a writers group with James Jacobs\
  \ to work on our fiction. We codified The Rule—Paizo's system for when to use numerals\
  \ versus spelling out numbers—and posted it on a support pillar with all the ceremony\
  \ of Martin Luther nailing The Ninety-Five Theses to a church door. (Many years\
  \ and an office change later, it still hangs in the Editorial Pit.) He would teach\
  \ me about game balance and grammar, and in exchange I would try to shock him with\
  \ tales of bohemian adventures and advise him on how to talk to girls. It was a\
  \ good system.</p> \n     <p>Something you need to understand about Mike was that\
  \ he was, at heart, a paladin. Or maybe a samurai. The point is, he believed in\
  \ being a Good Guy, and honestly lived according to a code of honor. He was nice\
  \ to everybody, and if you were his friend, there was never any question that he'd\
  \ be there for you.</p> \n     <p>But let's not make this too mushy. If anything,\
  \ Paizo's editorial team was built on its sense of humor, and there were pranks\
  \ galore in the early days. One of my favorite memories of Mike was when, due to\
  \ scheduling conflicts, I had to drop out of Jason Bulmahn's Eberron game that we'd\
  \ been in together for years. To have some fun with it, I secretly arranged with\
  \ Jason to punk everyone by killing off my character (tellingly named \"The Kid\"\
  ) in the most spectacular way possible. When the time came, halfway through the\
  \ session, everyone was shocked as my character was reduced to smoldering ruin.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>But none more so than Mike. After a heartfelt, Darth-Vader-esque \"\
  NOOOOOOOO!\", he tried desperately to save me, only to fail at every turn. I think\
  \ there were actually tears in his eyes as I cleaned up my dice and walked—apparently\
  \ heartbroken—out of the game. It was some of my best acting, and when Jason and\
  \ I revealed the next morning that it had all been a setup, folks had a good laugh.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Except for Mike, who missed the explanation, and who later tracked me\
  \ down to offer earnest condolences and make sure I was all right. I felt like a\
  \ total jerk explaining the truth (even though he agreed it was pretty funny), but\
  \ it drove home what I already knew: that Mike was a thoughtful guy who legitimately\
  \ cared about people.</p> \n     <p>Mike moved on from Paizo while Pathfinder was\
  \ still in its infancy, but if you've ever run a game in Korvosa, or worshiped Shelyn,\
  \ or fought dragons, or interacted with any of a thousand other elements he contributed\
  \ to the game, then you've been touched by his creativity.</p> \n     <p>Thank you,\
  \ Mike. It was a privilege to know you, and none of us would be where we are without\
  \ you. And as was drunkenly pointed out at many a joint birthday party—you had a\
  \ heart of gold.</p> \n     <h3>Jason Bulmahn</h3> \n     <p>Just over 10 years\
  \ ago, I moved to Seattle and one of the first friends I made out here was Mike\
  \ McArtor. Mike and I both worked on Dragon. Along with Wes we were the ones responsible\
  \ for developing the entire magazine month after month.</p> \n     <p>Being gamers,\
  \ I soon started up an office game set in Eberron and Mike was one of my players.\
  \ A lot of friendships were forged around that table and Mike, with his easy smile\
  \ and good nature, was a huge part of that. I also killed Mike's characters... a\
  \ lot. Mike had a tendency to make characters that would rush headlong into danger\
  \ and I ended up using his PC as the \"example\" of how hard core my game was on\
  \ more than one occasion. Mike would always laugh when his character was mulched,\
  \ disintegrated, or charred. He always had another ready for the next session.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Years later, we both played in the office Age of Worms playtest. Mike's\
  \ first character was a mute ninja (Mike loved ninjas). I honestly can't remember\
  \ how he died.. but I am sure it was \"quietly\". His second character was a druid\
  \ that was killed by his own animal companion. His third was Frothlethimble, a murderous,\
  \ backstabbing gnome.</p> \n     <p>How I hated that character. Mike loved to goad\
  \ on my honorable dwarf with his nasally gnome voice. We had a damn fine time going\
  \ back and forth threatening to kill one another. At one point I even forced a confrontation\
  \ with the rest of the party over which one of us would stay. After that, Frothlethimble\
  \ promised to kill me in my sleep. Gar (my dwarf) had heard enough. In the next\
  \ fight, against a mindflayer, the entire party was stunned except Gar. After putting\
  \ down the aberration, Gar turned to Frothlethimble and his axe swung one more time.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Its the only time I have ever intentionally killed a fellow PC.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Mike laughed and laughed. That is what I loved about Mike. He was kind,\
  \ he was honest, and he was a good man. I will miss him.</p> \n    </blockquote>\
