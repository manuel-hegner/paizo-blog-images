  \ and the design principles that went into the revision, you're in luck. The designers\

  >\n    </div> \n    <p>Much like the card game itself, the card game branch of Organized\
  \ Play is looking to build on feedback to make a better program, without throwing\
  \ out the content that we had before. We renamed the Pathfinder Adventure Card Guild\
  \ to the Pathfinder Adventure Card Society (PACS). This establishes our card game\
  \ as the third branch of our organized play programs, with me as the dedicated developer.\
  \ We will have year themes different from the Pathfinder Society, though there may\
  \ still be crossover events from time to time, and are looking at what kind of special\
  \ events we may be able to do besides the annual Open tournament.</p> \n    <p>In\
  \ the PACS, there will be a lot of features that you are already used to. Players\
  \ use class decks to play Adventures made up of several scenarios. As they play,\
  \ characters upgrade their deck and gain Feats, which let them improve their skills,\
  \ learn new powers, and add more cards to their deck. Every few scenarios, players\
  \ can increase their character's Tier, allowing them to play more challenging scenarios.</p>\
  \ \n    <h2>The Fangwood Thieves</h2> \n    <p><em>The Fangwood Thieves</em> is\
  \ the first PACS adventure to use the <em>Core Set</em>. The first two scenarios\
  \ debut at PaizoCon, and the second two debut at Origins (June 11-15). This collection\
  \ of 4 scenarios is designed as an introduction to the Core Set and is well-suited\
  \ as a demo for the game usable anywhere, particularly game stores and conventions.\
  \ It can also help new players catch up to other players who are playing an ongoing\
  \ Adventure Path.</p> \n    <p>The plot's fairly straightforward, taking place in\
  \ the Fangwood and involving a group of thieving kobolds. If you are steeped in\
  \ Golarion lore, you may notice a few nods to existing canon, such as references\
  \ to the aftermath of the Ironfang Invasion Adventure Path, but you don't need this\
  \ knowledge to enjoy the adventure.</p> \n    <h2>The Shape of Year 6</h2> \n  \
  \  <p>We're saving the name and symbol for Year 6 to be revealed at the PaizoCon\
  \ Banquet, but I can talk about the season's overall structure. Over the years,\
  \ we've received feedback that a season with a single large Adventure Path doesn't\
  \ fit the schedules of everyone in the community. To help address this concern,\
  \ we shortened the overarching Adventure Path story, including four scenarios per\
  \ adventure instead of five or six. Not only does this fit more naturally with the\
  \ new Hero Point model, but it also gives us more space in the season to experiment\
  \ with other scenario and adventure formats.</p> \n    <p>Speaking of other formats.\
  \ For Year 6, we'll be adding two new self-contained adventures. The first of these\
  \ adventures will release in early 2020, and the second in the summer of 2020. These\
  \ stand-alone adventures will be written for multiple Tiers to make them as versatile\
  \ as possible. To differentiate what is part of the meta-plot and what is not, we\
  \ are adopting a new title structure borrowed from the RPG adventure paths.</p>\
  \ \n    <h2>Rules Update</h2> \n    <p>Even though Season 6 itself won't start until\
  \ Gen Con, we'll be releasing an update to the Pathfinder Adventure Card Society\
  \ Guide at PaizoCon 2019 (May 24-27), to coincide with the release of the Core Set.\
  \ Here is a sneak peek of the three primary adjustments and one clarification appearing\
  \ in the updated guide.</p> \n    <h3>Using the Core Set Rules</h3> \n    <p>Card\
  \ Game Organized Play traditionally used the rulebook from the most recently released\
  \ boxed set (with help from the boxed set that the adventure uses for card-specific\
  \ rules). We'll be making this update again. Once the new guide releases, the revised\
  \ rules from the Core Set will become the new default for Organized Play. As with\
  \ previous rulebooks, the <em>Core Set</em> Rulebook will be available for free\
  \ at paizo.com/pacg. With the new model of production, in which products like the\
  \ <em>Curse of the Crimson Throne Adventure Path</em> are presented as expansions\
  \ on the <em>Core Set</em> rather than stand-alone games, the <em>Core Set</em>'s\
  \ rules will be the baseline rules for PACS for the foreseeable future.</p> \n \
  \   <p>So how should groups transition to the <em>Core Set</em> rules? The <em>Core\
  \ Set Rulebook</em> includes a one-page transition guide that neatly summarizes\
  \ the revision's changes and gives instructions for handling these changes when\
  \ playing older sets. There are also a few specific cards that will be receiving\
  \ changes. These changes will be available at <a href=\"/pacg\">paizo.com/pacg</a>.</p>\
  \ \n    <h3>Hero Points and Tiering Up</h3> \n    <p>In the <em>Core Set</em>, instead\
  \ of gaining specific power, card, and skill feats, characters earn hero points.\
  \ They can use these hero points to buy feats, reroll a die, or come back from the\
  \ dead. Going forward, hero points will be the new standard for organized play.\
  \ In PACS, a character can have several feats of each type equal to their Tier,\
  \ but they can take these feats in whatever order they like. Hero Points also allow\
  \ for more flexibility in how many scenarios a character can play before bumping\
  \ up to the next Tier of play. A character could rush their advancement and increase\
  \ their Tier after only 3 scenarios, or they could stick around for up to 6 scenarios\
  \ to continue to improve their deck.</p> \n    <h3>Challenge Modes</h3> \n    <p>The\
  \ <em>Core Set</em> includes options for making the game harder, introducing Heroic\
  \ and Legendary difficulty. We are looking into how we can incorporate these difficulty\
  \ levels into organized play and will have more information soon.</p> \n    <h3>Replay</h3>\
  \ \n    <p>This isn't a change, but it's a clarification of an ambiguous rule. The\
  \ rules about replay (namely, that characters that replay don't receive rewards)\
  \ refer only to that specific character. In Pathfinder Adventure Card Society, playing\
  \ a scenario with a different character does not count as “Replay.” This means that\
  \ when you play a scenario again with a different character, that character earns\
  \ the scenario's full rewards.</p> \n    <p>As always, we'll be keeping an eye out\
  \ for community feedback, from rules changes to the new adventure model, so let\
  \ us know what you think!</p> \n    <p>Linda Zayas-Palmer<br> <i>Developer</i></p>\
