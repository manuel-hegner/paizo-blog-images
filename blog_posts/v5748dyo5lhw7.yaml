  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">At Paizo, we get an overwhelming\
  \ amount of feedback surrounding the growth of the Pathfinder Society. Many of these\
  \ are positive reports of our volunteers and Venture Officers building strong gaming\
  \ groups and communities within their region. And occasionally, we hear back about\
  \ how these local chapters are turning their passion for gaming and PFS into a platform\
  \ for giving back to people in need. We were contacted by the Minneapolis/St. Paul\
  \ lodge recently, and wanted to share with you how they've decided to make a difference\
  \ through their local convention, Skål Con.</p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p>On\
  \ September 18-20, the Minneapolis/St. Paul Pathfinder Society lodge will host a\
  \ brand new convention: <a href=\"http://skalcon.org\" target=\"_blank\">Skål Con</a>.\
  \ This is our opportunity to give back to the community as Skål Con is a fundraiser\
  \ for local charity Tubman—Minnesota's largest provider of family crisis and support\
  \ services. We will donate every dollar we make beyond covering our base costs (which\
  \ we have done!) to <a href=\"http://tubman.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Tubman</a>:\
  \ all of it.</p> \n      <h2>The inside story...</h2> \n      <p>I was flush with\
  \ excitement from our best <a href=\"conofthenorth.org\" target=\"_blank\">Con of\
  \ the North</a> ever and wanted to keep the momentum going with a new convention.\
  \ With the input of other Venture Captain and having run conventions (including\
  \ in unconventional spaces, like grocery stores even!), I challenged myself to come\
  \ up with a plan. Fantasy Flight Games had opened a brand new game space, Fantasy\
  \ Flight Game Center, in the summer of 2014. We already have a great relationship\
  \ with management, and the room is large enough for our group. Within hours of getting\
  \ to work and emailing the rest of the Venture Officers and volunteers that made\
  \ Con of the North a success, we all went to work. It is a testament to our local\
  \ group of volunteers that within three months we had the more than just the skeleton\
  \ of the convention in place.</p> \n      <h2>Why charity? Why Tubman?</h2> \n \
  \     <p>I wanted Skål Con to be more than just another con, as it was our goal\
  \ to give back to the community in a meaningful way. I wanted us to do something\
  \ positive that benefited those who need help and have a great time doing so. When\
  \ I sat down to think about where our efforts should go to, the choice was easy.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Each year Tubman helps over 30,000 women, youth, men and families who\
  \ have experienced relationship violence, sexual assault and exploitation, elder\
  \ abuse, addiction, and other forms of trauma. As the state's largest provider of\
  \ domestic violence services, Tubman provides 20% of all Minnesota shelter beds\
  \ for women and children experiencing family violence. This is a small sampling\
  \ of the services they provide to those in need. I am proud we are able to help\
  \ a truly great organization reach their goals.</p> \n      <h2>We need your help!</h2>\
  \ \n      <p>Paizo has graciously allowed us to do a guest blog about our convention,\
  \ but to reach our fundraising goals our local chapter <i>needs your help</i>. Please\
  \ go to <a href=\"http://skalcon.org/index.php/register/\" target=\"_blank\">skå\
  lcon.org</a> to register for the convetion and/or donate. If you choose to attend,\
  \ we will be auctioning off items (like this signed <i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i>,\
  \ artwork, and more!), hosting raffles, and running both Pathfinder Society Roleplaying\
  \ Guild and Adventure Card game tables over the weekend. Your help allows us to\
  \ give back to our community.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a\
