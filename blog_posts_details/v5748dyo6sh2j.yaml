  alt: "Whether in a monastery, a religious household, or just as part of your everyday\
    \ life, your upbringing was steeped in the traditions of a faith or philosophy.\
    \ You might remain committed or you may have turned from your childhood creed,\
    \ but your skills are still founded in your devotion.\r\nChoose two ability boosts.\
    \ One boost must be to an ability specified in the Divine Ability entry for your\
    \ deity, and one is a free ability boost.\r\nYou’re trained in your deity’s associated\
    \ skill, and you gain Assurance with that skill. You gain a Lore skill with a\
    \ subcategory associated with your deity (Abadar Lore, for instance)."
