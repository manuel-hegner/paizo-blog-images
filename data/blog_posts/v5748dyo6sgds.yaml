  \  </div> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Last week I got to proof the new rulebook\
  \ for Core and it made me excited to talk more about the design principles for the\
  \ Pathfinder Adventure Card Game Core Set. As Mike explained <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkub\"\
  >in a previous blog</a>, we really wanted to give players the ability to control\
  \ the game's challenge level, as well as the ability to speed the game up when desired.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>I'm a big fan of giving players control knobs in games. We've all tinkered\
  \ with house rules to increase the fun for our table. The problem with house rules\
  \ is that they vary pretty wildly from house to house, which can occasionally be\
  \ tough. They also tend to have less rigorous testing and development. Official\
  \ options for changing the game are better, since they provide a common language\
  \ of well-tested options.</p> \n     <p>We've all tried to control the difficulty\
  \ level in our games, too. It's easy and obvious in video games (like picking Legendary\
  \ difficulty in Obsidian's <a href=\"https://pathfinder.obsidian.net\">Pathfinder\
  \ Adventures</a>), but in the RPG, the adventure you choose, the GM, the characters,\
  \ and the people playing them all have a pretty profound effect on difficulty, too.\
  \ When people discuss PACG sets they often talk about difficulty as a primary reason\
  \ to choose one set over another. It's good to have variety, but it's a shame to\
  \ rule out a set because it's too easy or hard!</p> \n     <p>The amount of time\
  \ available to play can change session to session, as can the number of players,\
  \ and more players <i>usually</i> means more time required. We really wanted to\
  \ present options that would let you look at the number of players and the amount\
  \ of time you have so you can say \"let's play one long scenario\" or \"let's knock\
  \ out two quick scenarios.\"</p> \n     <p>Ideally, you can alter the difficulty\
  \ on the fly to suit the particular players that night, or to match the scenario.\
  \ You like a hard game, but you just failed the scenario? Drop the difficulty a\
  \ notch before replaying it!</p> \n     <h2>Change Things Up... Or Down</h2> \n\
  \     <p>The first thing we decided to do was create small, medium, and large locations.\
  \ Medium locations are what you're used to. Small locations usually have 3 fewer\
  \ cards, which speeds up the game while making it easier. Large locations usually\
  \ have 3 more cards, giving you a longer, more challenging scenario.</p> \n    \
  \ <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20181120-LocationList.png\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20181120-LocationList_180.png\"\
  ></a> \n      <br><i>Bigger locations have more banes, but also more boons. Everyone\
  \ likes boons!</i>\n      <p></p>\n     </div> \n     <p>Next, we gave you some\
  \ freedom to change the number of cards in the blessings deck—which, since it often\
  \ contains things that aren't blessings, has been renamed the hourglass. While the\
  \ hourglass defaults to 30 blessings, we heartily encourage you to play with fewer\
  \ or more blessings. Fewer cards in the hourglass speeds up the game while making\
  \ it harder, and more cards gives you more time to win, making the game easier.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>Because location size and hourglass size can be changed independently,\
  \ you can dial in length and challenge level to your liking. If you combine small\
  \ locations (faster + easier) and fewer cards in the hourglass (faster + harder),\
  \ you get a faster game that's close to normal difficulty. Some of our testers prefer\
  \ a version of the game that uses small locations and just 12 blessings + 2 per\
  \ character because they can play twice as many scenarios in the same amount of\
  \ time. Some of our testers with larger groups like large locations and extra blessings\
  \ to give them an epic, satisfying scenario where everyone gets several turns.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>(There's another reason for the name hourglass: The top card of the\
  \ hourglass discards is now called the \"hour,\" and new blessings have powers that\
  \ happen when they are the hour. This ends the disconnect that new players had after\
  \ flipping over a blessing at the start of their first turn:</p> \n     <blockquote>\
  \ \n      <p><i>New player:</i> Ok, what do I do with this?</p> \n      <p><i>Experienced\
  \ player:</i> Nothing.</p> \n      <p><i>New player:</i> It has all these words,\
  \ but I don't do anything with it?</p> \n      <p><i>Experienced player:</i> No.\
  \ It's just a timer.</p> \n      <p><i>New player:</i> …Oh. Um, okay.</p> \n   \
  \  </blockquote> \n     <p>Also, I can unofficially refer to each turn as \"flipping\
  \ the hourglass,\" which reminds me to actually flip the card, and feels thematic.\
  \ And when you've got that one friend who can't make any decisions but still wants\
  \ to explore five times per turn you can remind them they're not supposed to take\
  \ a <i>literal</i> hour.)</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"\

  //cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20181120-CaydensRevelry_180.png\"></a>\
  \ \n      <br><i>When the hour can change your turn, especially for the better,\
  \ you get used to looking at it.<br>(Oh, and we redesigned all the card faces. Surprise!\
  \ We'll talk more about that later.)</i>\n      <p></p>\n     </div> \n     <h2>Let's\
  \ Get Wild</h2> \n     <p>We've also been playing around with some ideas for changing\
  \ up scenarios for quite some time. They started out as \"templates\" similar to\
  \ ones used in the RPG, but Obsidian's <a href=\"https://pathfinder.obsidian.net\"\
  >Pathfinder Adventures</a> app helped crystallize the concept into \"wildcards.\"\
  \ Core and Curse each include a number of different options that increase the difficulty\
  \ of the game and make it less predictable. You can use any number of them, either\
  \ chosen or random, depending on the desires of the group.</p> \n     <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20181120-ThePerils.png\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20181120-ThePerils_180.png\"\
  ></a> \n      <br><i>Hate long turns? Just add Wearisome. Want to die in a fire?\
  \ Try an Ablaze, Deadly, and Hostile game!<br>(And did I mention that the card images\
  \ show work in progress?)</i>\n      <p></p>\n     </div> \n     <p>If you're looking\
  \ to adjust the difficulty in a more straightforward manner, you can treat your\
  \ adventure as 1 higher or lower in difficulty. This increases or decreases the\
  \ difficulty of Veteran banes. You can also add banes of a higher adventure number\
  \ to your box to encounter earlier, which can be an exciting and unexpected change,\
  \ especially for replay.</p> \n     <p>Speaking of replay, we've also offered the\
  \ option to play the scenarios on Heroic and Legendary difficulty, which incorporate\
  \ a few of the above options. In addition to bragging rights and a more entertaining\
  \ game for those who seek a challenge, you get a reward for completing adventures\
  \ on higher difficulties: you get to erase a feat, then take a feat of the same\
  \ type. It doesn't increase your power level at all, but it does make you more flexible\
  \ and lets you address any regrets you might have in an officially sanctioned and\
  \ fun way.</p> \n     <p>I hope folks are looking forward to customizing their play\
  \ experience, as well as all of the new cards, characters, and scenarios!</p> \n\
