  date\">Saturday, August 18, 2007</p> \n   <p>Today was another hectic day in the\
  \ booth! Saturday has the reputation as the busiest day of the con and today was\
  \ no exception. Paizo's booth was buzzing with the news of our awards last night\
  \ at the ENniesâ€”we took home two gold medals for GameMastery Flip-Mat: Tavern (the\
  \ second year in a row a Flip-Mat has won a gold ENnie) and the Savage Tide Player's\
  \ Guide free download and our partner company, Open Mind Games, took home a much-deserved\
  \ silver ENnie for the awesome GameMastery Combat Pad.</p> \n   <p>We also had Gary\
  \ Gygax back on hand with us signing The Anubis Murders, as well as Larry Elmore\
  \ signing the final print issue of Dragon, and our own Paizo editors signing their\
  \ works as well. James, Wes, Jason, and Jeremy signed a good deal of autographs\
  \ and it was nice to see the readers and fans patting these guys on the back for\
  \ their amazing work on Dragon, Dungeon, and Paizo's GameMastery and Pathfinder\
  \ lines.</p> \n   <p>Today was also Nicolas Logue's Iron DM. Nick runs this event\
  \ every year and its reputation as one awesome gaming experience has increased its\
  \ attendance year-over-year. Iron DM saw 15 Dungeon Masters and over 130 players\
  \ this year. If you're not familiar with the event, Iron DM is modeled after the\
  \ Iron Chef television series: DMs get one hour to write an entire adventure using\
  \ three \"ingredients\" that Nick reveals at the last second. Once the adventure\
  \ is written, the DMs find their randomly assigned table of players and begin. The\
  \ event is often interrupted by mini-games called Player Olympics, wherein the players\
  \ must compete table-against-table to win prizes and fame. At the end of the day,\
  \ the Iron DM who receives the best review scores from his or her players wins the\
  \ crown. Paizo Publishing was proud to sponsor this event, and we gave away buckets\
  \ of GameMastery items as prizes. I have a video of Nick introducing one of the\
  \ Iron DMs that I'll upload to YouTube when I return to the office. Nick is most\
  \ definitely a character and his Iron DM event was a blast.</p> \n   <p>Tomorrow\
  \ is our final day at Gen Con and, though my tired feet wish its end, it would be\
  \ great if the gaming and fun could continue on for another four days.</p> \n  \
  \ <p>And now, pictures!</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <table cellspacing=\"18\" border=\"\
