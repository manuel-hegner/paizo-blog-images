  \   </div> \n   <p>Cave Raptors are sated; It's time to blog!</p> \n   <p>When last\
  \ we left <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderCompanion/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy87dj\"\
  \ target=\"nofollow\"><i>Dwarves of Golarion</i></a>, it was a mere egg of an outline,\
  \ being fussed over by attentive parents and waiting to hatch. But now it is time\
  \ for that blessed moment when an idea emerges into the world as written words!\
  \ It is time forâ€¦ the development phase!</p> \n   <p>Development is the process\
  \ of growing a book from an idea and a few rough notes into written text, rearing\
  \ the infant outline into a rebellious and hateful teenager who will keep you up\
  \ at nights, drinking your secret stash of scotch and praying to god it turns out\
  \ alright. Much like the rearing of the noble octopus, a game product requires two\
  \ separate parties: the designer and the developer. Designers are the writers and\
  \ artists (more on those wily and attractive artists next week), while the developers\
  \ are the core who tie everything together. Where developers are comparable to an\
  \ overprotective parent, designers are more akin to teachers: chosen carefully by\
  \ the developer to impart information and direction to their snot-nosed offspring.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Of course, this is not an insult. Both octopi and game developers are\
  \ widely known for their post-nasal drip.</p> \n   <p>Choosing a writer is a careful\
  \ task. Like parents, developers want someone who will make their job easier. These\
  \ choices are made by means of an arcane formula that takes into account past products,\
  \ punctuality, and relative position of the stars. Managing Editor Wes Schneider\
  \ admits that Paizo relies on a small, incestuous lot of authors to rear our products.\
  \ Putting new designers through their paces requires time and branding irons, both\
  \ of which Paizo has in painfully limited quantities*.</p> \n   <p>For roleplaying\
  \ products, the ideal designer can fill three vital roles for the juvenile product:\
  \ author, game mechanic, and artisan. Telling a good story and having a firm grasp\
  \ of the mechanics are important, but just as vital and oft overlooked is the role\
  \ of player-friendly artifacts in a young game's life. Like a sweater vest, legible\
  \ maps and gripping player handouts are those little touches that decide if a product\
  \ rides along on the bus or resides at the cool table at lunch. </p> \n   <p>The\
  \ developers' job is just as challenging and vital to give their books the best\
  \ chance at happiness. They need to organize everything those precious bundles have\
  \ absorbed from their designers and make sure they play nice with the other products.\
  \ A developer needs to tweak the mechanics to balance with the system at large,\
  \ rewrite some fluff to keep the narrative canon, and embarrass the product in front\
  \ of its friends. Even the best writing needs at least a week or two in development,\
  \ says Schneider, because \"folks aren't here every day, and they don't know exactly\
  \ what we need.\"</p> \n   <p><i>Dwarves of Golarion</i> and similar anthology products\
  \ are like troubled foster kids: they get bounced between several authors and other\
  \ corrupting influences. A firm and loving eyeball is needed to guide them through\
  \ this troubled time. The twitterpated Sean Reynolds, developer in charge of this\
  \ problem child, has had his hands full. Every line written by its savage gang of\
  \ authors needs to be reviewed for balance and continuity, and he must occasionally\
  \ search its room for illicit substances and pop culture references.</p> \n   <p>Without\
  \ proper development, a game product suffers. Its already-overworked Paizo parents\
  \ stretch themselves too thin trying to write thousands of words a day while maintaining\
  \ their backbreaking day jobs in the grammar mines. Neglected and uneducated, the\
  \ books would fall back into dull narrative habits and eventually turn to crime\
  \ to make ends meet. Crime rates skyrocket, property values plummet, and we are\
  \ all left unprepared for the forthcoming invasion of the reptimen from the Earth's\
  \ core!</p> \n   <p>So, for a happy and contributing addition to the RPG landscape,\
  \ make sure you follow the example of the methodical octopus. Keep a close group\
  \ of talent to help raise your products, but don't give away your own parental responsibilities!</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Tune in next week, when we examine the art of art, and stretch the octopus\
  \ metaphor to it's breaking point!</p> \n   <p>Crystal Frasier <br>Production Assistant</p>\
  \ \n   <p class=\"tiny\">*Wes also mentions that if you're a newcomer who'd like\
  \ to write for Paizo and has a high pain threshold, you should still write and submit.\
  \ Both the Pathfinder Society Open Call and RPG Superstar are Paizo's favorite tools\
  \ for reviewing new blood in an organized setting. Publishing your own material\
  \ online through a blog or website is a good icebreaker as well (check out <a href=\"\
  http://paizo.com/paizo/about/communityuse\">Paizo's Community Use Policy</a> for\
  \ more details). Being on productive and nonviolent terms with other publishers\
  \ also helps, as the RPG industry is made up of a mere 73 people, all of whom know\
  \ each other personally and frequently gather for the imbibing of caustic organic\
  \ solvents.</p> \n  </blockquote> <!-- tags: Crystal Frasier, dwarves, goblins,\
