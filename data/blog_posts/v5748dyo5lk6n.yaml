  \ Your Own Aliens</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Friday, October 6, 2017</p> \n  \
  \  <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">There's a chill\
  \ in the atmosphere, a hint of pumpkin spice in the air recyclers, and fallen leaves\
  \ are littering the floor of the hydroponics bay. Yes, October is here, and so is\
  \ the <a href=\"/products/btpy9ujg?Starfinder-Alien-Archive\"><em>Starfinder Alien\
  \ Archive</em></a>! Over the next few weeks, we'll be previewing some of what can\
  \ be found in this newest offering for the Starfinder RPG, starting with some goodies\
  \ for Game Masters!</p> \n     <p>The <em>Alien Archive</em> is chock full of strange\
  \ alien creatures and fearsome extrasolar monsters to populate your Starfinder games,\
  \ but when your players discover an uncharted world deep in the Vast, you'll want\
  \ to create your weird own native life-forms to inhabit it. Fortunately, the <em>Alien\
  \ Archive</em> has you covered!</p> \n     <p>First off, in Starfinder, all nonplayer\
  \ characters (NPCs as well as monsters) are built using different rules from those\
  \ used to create player characters. Since most monsters are needed for just one\
  \ encounter, this system allows GMs to quickly and easily create NPCs and monsters\
  \ without having to go through the entire process of building a player character.\
  \ So how does it work?</p> \n     <p>The central components of monster creation\
  \ in Starfinder are arrays and grafts. Every monster derives the majority of its\
  \ statistics from one of three arrays, which define the monster's primary role:\
  \ combatant, expert, or spellcaster. Unsurprisingly, combatants are those who excel\
  \ in combat, experts are more skill-focused, and spellcasters primarily use spells\
  \ or other magic. The numbers from a monster's array are not set in stone, but they\
  \ give you a baseline that can be modified by grafts, special abilities, or your\
  \ own preferences.</p> \n     <p>After you've chosen an array for your monster,\
  \ you add grafts to it, which adjust the monster's various stats and add additional\
  \ abilities. There are grafts for creature types and subtypes, as well as a graft\
  \ for each character class. Generally speaking, an NPC or monster will only use\
  \ a creature type graft or a class graft, not both, depending on the monster's focus.\
  \ Template grafts are another option that transform a creature in some way. For\
  \ example, you might create a new alien using the combatant array and the monstrous\
  \ humanoid creature type graft, then turn it into a shambling, technological undead\
  \ horror by adding the cybernetic zombie template graft.</p> \n     <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7105-MonsterCreation1.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7105-MonsterCreation1_360.jpeg\"></a> <a\

  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/PZO7105-MonsterCreation2_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n     </div> \n     <p>Once you have these basics in place, you can start\
  \ giving your monster special abilities. The monster's array and its CR determine\
  \ how many special abilities it has. If a monster has a class graft, that class\
  \ determines most, if not all, of its special abilities, but for non-classed monsters,\
  \ you can add your own abilities or choose abilities from the list of Universal\
  \ Creature Rulesâ€”those special abilities that appear in the stat blocks of the various\
  \ creatures in the <i>Alien Archive</i>.</p> \n     <p>By this point, you're mostly\
  \ done. Choose your monster's skills and determine a few other statistics like initiative,\
  \ speed, and languages. If your monster has spells, you'll need to determine which\
  \ spells it can cast, and you might need to outfit your monster with some armor,\
  \ weapons, and other gear, but you should have all the statistics you need to use\
  \ the monster in play.</p> \n     <p>In addition to dozens of fully detailed creatures,\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9ujg?Starfinder-Alien-Archive\"><em>Starfinder Alien Archive\
  \ </em></a>provides GMs with tons of options to build and customize NPCs and monsters\
  \ for Starfinder. Check out the full rules and keep your eyes on the blog for more\
