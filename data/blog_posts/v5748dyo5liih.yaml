  ><i>Hello, Pathfinders, Tanis here! This week we've got two fantastic blogs for\
  \ you in one jam-packed edition. First up is Organized Play Coordinator Tonya Woldridge\
  \ with a con report from Con of the North and Winter Fantasy, and the launch of\
  \ Season of the Runelords. Then, we've got Adventure Card Game Lead Designer Mike\
  \ Selinker with an announcement and a tease for Obsidian's digital </i>Pathfinder\
  \ Adventures<i>. But enough from me. On with the show!</i></p> \n     <h2>Season\
  \ of the Runelords is Here!</h2> \n     <div class=\"blurb180\">\n      <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy98no\"><img src=\"/image/product/catalog/PZO/PZOACG0000E_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>The past two weekends, I've been attending conventions\
  \ and spending much of my time at Adventure Card Guild tables previewing Season\
  \ of the Runelords. This season is set after the events of <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/riseOfTheRunelords\"\
  ><em>Rise of the Runelords</em></a>, and examines the question of what the <i>other</i>\
  \ Runelords are doing. Starting with the first scenario (\"Goblins? Gross!\"), it's\
  \ obvious that Tanis and the developers at Lone Shark Games turned up the witty\
  \ titles, exciting adventures, and variety to suit different character's abilities.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>So far, each session brought full tables, and many players rearranged\
  \ their schedules to return to the Adventure Card Game area and play more. Over\
  \ the next few months, many conventions will boast ACG tables including GaryCon\
  \ (Lake Geneva, WI), Conflagration (Brookfield, WI), Gem State Convention (Boise,\
  \ ID), and of course, <a href=\"/paizocon\">PaizoCon</a>! PaizoCon will host a boatload\
  \ of Season of the Runelords tables, as well as exclusive ACG events. You can keep\
  \ up on announcements for PaizoCon on the blog or by watching the <a href=\"/paizocon\"\
  >main PaizoCon page</a>.</p> \n     <p>Outside of conventions, many local Pathfinder\
  \ Society chapters host ACG events. Last weekend I learned that the greater Minneapolis-St.\
  \ Paul region has three stores running Season of the Righteous and Season of the\
  \ Shackles, and are trying to figure out when and where to run Season of the Runelords.\
  \ I'd like to give a big shout out to Erica Lopnow, Sean Pearson, and the rest of\
  \ the team at Con of the North for all of the time they spent organizing ACG activities\
  \ this weekend and throughout the year. To find a local Adventure Card Guild game\
  \ or start your own, read through the <em>Adventure Card Guild Guide</em> or contact\
  \ your local <a href=\"/pathfindersociety/about/regionalCoordinators\">Venture-Officer</a>\
  \ for more information.</p> \n     <p>Speaking of the <em>Guide</em>, it is my pleasure\
  \ to officially open the Season of the Runelords, and announce that the new version\
  \ of the <a href=\"/products/btpy98no\"><em>Pathfinder Society Adventure Card Guild\
  \ Guide</em></a> is now available. You can also find an <a href=\"/threads/rzs2tf7o\"\
  >ongoing schedule for the scenario and adventure releases on our forums</a>. I encourage\
  \ all of you to return to Sandpoint with me and visit our favorite NPCs and villiansâ€”\
  Mayor Deverin, Father Zantus, and Gogmurt!</p> \n     <p>Watch out for gross goblins!</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Tonya Woldridge<br> <i>Organized Play Coordinator</i></p> \n     <h2>What's\
  \ It Like When Obsidian Makes a Digital Version of Your Game?</h2> \n     <p>It's\
  \ great! And that's all I'll ever say about that.</p> \n     <p>KIDDING. I've got\
  \ a bunch to say about that, but there's only so much I can say today. That's because\
  \ <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_ACG/comments/454g5l/on_wednesday_february_17th_obsidian_entertainment/\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">the Obsidian guys and I have a Reddit AMA</a> Wednesday at 10:30\
  \ am PST, and they want me to save some stuff for that. But I will be showing off\
  \ some really cool info about the all-digital port they call <a href=\"https://pathfinder.obsidian.net\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\"><em>Pathfinder Adventures</em></a> next week, ahead of the official\
  \ release on <b>March 29</b>. So immeasurably stoked. See you over on Reddit.</p>\
