  articleBody\"> \n    <p>With the release of <a href=\"/products/btpy8yow\"><i>The\
  \ Skinsaw Murders</i></a> fast approaching, Paizo has once again let me peel back\
  \ the curtain a little to show off the new Adventure Deck. Since last time, we all\
  \ have a great deal more experience with the game, and some of you have even started\
  \ to speculate on what you might see in the second Adventure.</p> \n    <p>Those\
  \ of you familiar with the <i>Rise of the Runelords</i> Adventure Path—or who've\
  \ pored over the box for <i>The Skinsaw Murders</i>—know that there's going to be\
  \ some creepy undead action ahead, perfect for an October release. Keeping with\
  \ that theme, we'll jump right in with a little <u>Undead Uprising</u>. During this\
  \ scenario, the restless dead keep rising all around Sandpoint until the adventurers\
  \ manage to defeat a most unfriendly chap that we'll meet in a moment.</p> \n  \
  \  <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6002-Uprising1.jpg\"\

  /image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6002-Uprising2_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a> \n \
  \   </div> \n    <p>Our goal here is to create an ever-rising wave of undead all\
  \ around town, combined with a sense of urgency without overwhelming the party.\
  \ Adding henchmen to locations helps keep the undead presence high while making\
  \ it more likely that the adventurers will close the locations before time runs\
  \ out.</p> \n    <p>While the adventurers are probably in good shape to deal with\
  \ a simple farmer or shopkeeper risen as a zombie, there are more menacing threats\
  \ lurking in the dark places of Sandpoint, including these vile fellows:</p> \n\
  \    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6002-Ghoulcrow.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6002-Ghoulcrow_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a> \n    </div> \n    <p>Hiding ghouls inside the numerous scarecrows that\
  \ dot the farms and fields outside of Sandpoint? Genius! Experienced Pathfinder\
  \ players already know what a tremendous pain ghouls can be, and we think we've\
  \ lived up to that promise here. In addition to the typical undead immunity to mental\
  \ and poison effects, losing a fight with a ghoul scarecrow doesn't just hurt you;\
  \ it also leaves you paralyzed for a short time. In PACG terms, in addition to taking\
  \ damage from the Ghoul, you'll lose the ability to explore any further that turn.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>What might be causing these undead uprisings, anyway? By the end of <i>The\
  \ Skinsaw Murders</i>, you'll no doubt figure that out, but along the way, you might\
  \ run into a particularly gruesome example of evil afoot, a <u>Skinsaw Ritual</u>.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6002-Skinsaw.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6002-Skinsaw_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"\
  ></a> \n    </div> \n    <p>During these macabre events, several cultists attempt\
  \ to carve and mutilate the heroes as part of a grisly offering that hurts everyone\
  \ present, including the cultists. If you've encountered cultists before, you already\
  \ know how they advance the villain's plot—unless you can stop them.</p> \n    <p>Not\
  \ all the news is bad, of course. Now that the adventurers have proved themselves\
  \ heroes, the people of Sandpoint lend a hand, as best they can. For example, the\
  \ noted sage <u>Brodert Quink</u> can be very useful, especially if called upon\
  \ at just the right time.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6002-Quink.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6002-Quink_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\
  \ \n    </div> \n    <p>Some characters will be able to call upon Brodert's sagacity\
  \ more than once, but any of the adventurers can put the sage to good use. Changing\
  \ the order of cards in a location deck is a very powerful ability, and Brodert\
  \ can give you a peek at part of location deck that's otherwise very hard to see.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>With the help of the estimable sage, you might find one of the new items,\
  \ spells, blessings, armor, allies, or weapons added for the adventure. One especially\
  \ thematic example is the <u>Scythe +1</u>:</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  > <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6002-Scythe.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6002-Scythe_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a> \n    </div> \n    <p>In trained hands, this weapon can make\
  \ quick work of any <u>Ghosts</u> or <u>Spectres</u> that might have plagued you\
  \ in <i>Burnt Offerings</i>. As a \"high crit\" weapon, the scythe can land some\
  \ devastating blows, adding as much as 16 to a combat check!</p> \n    <p>Speaking\
  \ of devastating, let's take a peek at the troublemaker behind the uprising, and\
  \ see what new tricks our villains have learned. Unsurprisingly, there's a necromancer\
  \ behind it all (at least for now), and <u>Caizarlu Zerren</u> doesn't disappoint.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6002-Zerren.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6002-Zerren_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"\
  ></a> \n    </div> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">In addition to being\
  \ constantly surrounded by a cadre of mindless undead, Zerren has picked up one\
  \ of the favored tricks of the heroes: a <i>mirror image</i> effect! To top it off,\
  \ the foul necromancer deals poison damage, neatly bypassing many forms of protection.\
  \ All in all, we're hoping that Caizarlu is someone that you'll love to hate, and\
  \ he's just the first of many. You'll also encounter ghosts, ghouls, ghasts, haunts,\
  \ strange abominations, and more ghouls (more ghouls!) as you unravel the riddle\
  \ of <a href=\"/products/btpy8yow\"><i>The Skinsaw Murders</i></a>.</span></p> \n\
