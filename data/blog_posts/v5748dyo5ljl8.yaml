  \ who condemned them to an asylum with no memory of their former selves, the Order\
  \ of the Amber Die tackles the fourth adventure of the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/strangeAeons\"\
  >Strange Aeons Adventure Path</a>. It looks like they had a great time (as usual),\
  \ and this time around it was great to read the live tweeting from the Order's newest\
  \ member—former Paizo intern Savannah Broadway.</p> \n     <p>Here's their report\
  \ from their marathon experience with <a href=\"/products/btpy9q9o?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-112-The-Whisper-Out-of-Time\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #112: The Whisper Out of Time</em></a>! As always,\
  \ proceed with caution if you are playing in this Adventure Path or planning to\
  \ do so, as spoilers may lurk within the following words.</p> \n     <blockquote>\
  \ \n      <p>After reaching the Taldan port city of Cassomir and recovering from\
  \ the madness that plagued several of our party members, our group was eager to\
  \ chase Count Lowls further into this Adventure Path. We knew we were in for a long\
  \ run when our GM booked an extra day for this marathon. We ended up setting an\
  \ Order of the Amber Die record, staying in the same house for 93 hours, and playing\
  \ over 60 of those. We also saw three of Golarion's signature cities, and traversed\
  \ nearly 800 miles.</p> \n      <p>Making this marathon even more significant for\
  \ us was the return of <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ldj9?Meet-the-Intern-Savannah\"\
  >Savannah Broadway</a>, taking the role of Winter Klaczka and leading \"Winter's\
  \ Wolves\" to victory once again. We opened up the first night of play with an official\
  \ draft ceremony, fully inducting Savannah into the Order—our first new member in\
  \ three years! After presenting her with an official Order of the Amber Die jersey,\
  \ it was time to settle in for a few days of Pathfinder.</p> \n      <p>To keep\
  \ us fully immersed, we used <a href=\"http://www.adventurescents.com/\" target=\"\
  _blank\">AdventureScents</a> to overwhelm our olfactory senses with the myriad smells\
  \ of an alchemist's lab, followed by the moldy paper of an ancient library. For\
  \ the streets of Cassomir, we combined buildings from <a href=\"http://www.customkingdoms.com/\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Custom Kingdoms</a> with a 4 ft. x 6 ft. gridded cobblestone\
  \ battlemat from <a href=\"http://www.deepcutstudio.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Deep-Cut\
  \ Studio</a>.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderAdventurePath/20170307-CustomKingdoms.jpg\"\

  \      <ul>\n       <li>In the top floors of an old infirmary, we chased a three-armed\
  \ derro vivisectionist through a maze of skin. Enough said.</li> \n       <li>Searching\
  \ for the Mysterium, one of the oldest libraries on Golarion, we rolled into majestic\
  \ Katheer to the sounds of Mosavo's \"Mystic Caravan.\" While many dungeons we've\
  \ crawled have contained a library, in this adventure the largest dungeon was a\
  \ library.</li> \n       <li>Before we could figure out how to shut off the Mysterium's\
  \ warped defense system, we faced packs of hounds—of Tindalos! Sixteen slain was\
  \ the number, with MVP Quinn taking on four at once in a plan gone awry.</li> \n\
  \       <li>Going into this adventure, we knew we'd be up against author Richard\
  \ Pett. Gaming convention crowds and the Paizo messageboards helped confirm that\
  \ with Xanesha from Rise of the Runelords, he possessed perhaps more TPKs than any\
  \ contemporary author. Though we managed to best her in 2014, Xanesha still put\
  \ 4 of our iconics in the ground. Pett delivered again in this adventure. In the\
  \ extradimensional heart of the library, we faced off against a corrupted archon\
  \ known only as \"The Keeper,\" who shook off three <i>banishments</i> and two <i>hold\
  \ monsters</i> while draining over 20 ability points on round one. At a critical\
  \ moment, he succumbed to the 1st level spell <i>ill omen</i>, and we managed a\
  \ clean game.</li> \n       <li>In Okeno, we had to navigate a difficult parley\
  \ with the Hyena Princess Njano. Since two members are lawful good, our party tried\
  \ everything—which meant slipping into her milk bath to discuss terms.</li> \n \
  \      <li>On the rooftop of a gnoll fortress known as Blossoming Thorn, we got\
  \ ourselves into the largest melee of the campaign thus far. An airwalking Quinn\
  \ engaged Biting Lash, one of the most notorious slavers in the Yellow City. At\
  \ the same time, Erasmus took on her bodyguard, scimitar versus scimitar. Alahazra\
  \ slowed the reinforcements with <i>bursts of radiance</i>, while Winter provided\
  \ Pharasma's blessing through Fateful Channel. As Feiya engaged their enemy sorcerer\
  \ in an arcane duel, Daji jumped into the scrap by going after Biting Lash's eagle\
  \ animal companion. Just as we were about to be overwhelmed, we grabbed our quarry\
  \ and called for the <i>teleport</i> extraction. Mission successful.</li>\n    \

  \ creepy whispers and a strange bell throughout the adventure. We've gotten so used\
  \ to the unexplainable in this Adventure Path, that we just wrote them off as more\
  \ Lovecraftian enigmas that will be revealed in time.</p> \n      <h2>Character\
  \ Deaths</h2> \n      <p>It turns out the cult of Hastur was more widespread than\
  \ we thought. Cultists hunted us through the damp streets of Cassomir, leading to\
  \ two deadly ambushes that resulted in casualties amounting to: several townsfolk,\
  \ a byakhee, a few dire bats, a keeper of the yellow sign, and some members of the\
  \ city guard. With the help of our cult hunter, we fought our way out of their tentacles,\
  \ but lost Feiya both times.</p> \n      <h2>Best Quote from Marathon 4</h2> \n\
  \      <p><i>Alahazra</i> (after slaying a Dark Young of Shub-Niggurath): \"We just\
  \ pissed off a Great Old One.\"<br> <i>Winter</i> (in a Russian accent): \"It is\
  \ having a thousand young, I don't think it is going to miss one...\"</p> \n   \
  \   <h2>Current Situation</h2> \n      <p>We've exchanged dark and fog-shrouded\
  \ Ustalav for more sun and heat than we ever expected coming into this AP. Armed\
  \ with a map, ample supplies, and gnoll guides provided by the untrustworthy slaver\
  \ named Biting Lash, we're headed deep into the Parchlands of Casmaron for part\
  \ five. Semi-finals, here we come!</p> \n      <h2>More Content</h2> \n      <p>Read\
