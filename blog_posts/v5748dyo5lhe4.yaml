  \ href=\"/pathfinderbattles\"><img src=\"/image/content/Logos/PFBattles_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n   </div> \n   <h1 itemprop=\"headline\">Happy Birthday to Me!</h1> \n  \
  \ <p class=\"date\">Friday, April 24, 2015</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"\
  > \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">As I mentioned in <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lhd9\"\
  >last week's preview</a>, Wednesday was my birthday, so for this week's preview\
  \ blog, I want to be a bit selfish and focus on three of MY personal favorite figures\
  \ from June's <a href=\"/products/btpy9bc6\"><em>Dungeons Deep</em></a> set of <a\
  \ href=\"/pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder Battles</a> prepainted plastic gaming figures.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Without further ado (and because I'm old now, and I'm rapidly losing\
  \ patience), let's get on with it!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a\
  \ href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150424-CruelFront.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150424-CruelFront_120.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Here we have my favorite figure in the whole set, the\
  \ Cruel Conjurer, from page 190 of the <a href=\"/products/btpy8v3a\"><em>Pathfinder\
  \ RPG NPC Codex</em></a>. The Conjurer in that book is statted up as a 15th-level\
  \ human wizard, but I think the figure works for just about any sort of evil mystic.\
  \ I say evil because of the various hooked chains and things hanging from his belt,\
  \ and for the foreboding hood he wears, but we all know a lot of player characters\
  \ like to look a little tough now and again, so I can even see the Cruel Conjurer\
  \ used as a player character mini. The Cruel Conjurer is a Medium, uncommon figure\
  \ you won't believe isn't a rare.</p> \n    <p>Aside from a great sculpt and an\
  \ awesome paint job, the Cruel Conjurer has two unusual elements that push it to\
  \ the top tier of minis, in my opinion. The first is the unusual swirl of green\
  \ mystical energy keeping him levitated off the ground. This is a weird effect for\
  \ a mini in general, making the Cruel Conjurer stand out from the crowd, but the\
  \ really exciting element here is the color of the energy. It's difficult to describe,\
  \ and I'm not certain it comes out perfectly in the photos, but the green WizKids\
  \ used here is an AMAZING shade of green. It's got just the right level of tone\
  \ and opacity to create a very special effect. Whenever I take the <a href=\"/products/btpy9bc6\"\
  ><em>Dungeons Deep</em></a> figures around the office, the Cruel Conjurer is one\
  \ that everybody highlights as a favorite.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150424-CruelBack.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150424-CruelBack_120.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>But really, the coolest aspect of the Cruel Conjurer\
  \ is his grimoire, which balances atop the green energy. WizKids went above and\
  \ beyond with the tampo stamp effects on this guy to the point that his magic book\
  \ even has magical writing on the pages! The photo above is a little rough and blurry,\
  \ but you can see over his shoulder that this mini is reading a bit more than the\
  \ usual blank pages so common among his 30mm peers. I love it, and consider the\
  \ Cruel Conjurer the greatest birthday gift of the entire set.</p> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150424-MouthHorror.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150424-MouthHorror_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>But the Cruel Conjurer isn't the only disturbing figure\
  \ in the set. For my favorite of the gross figures we've got the Mouth Horror, a\
  \ familiar creature from page 153 of the <a href=\"/products/btpy8auu\"><em>Pathfinder\
  \ RPG Bestiary</em></a>. Dude is gross. I don't know what else to tell you except\
  \ that you probably need three of them. The Mouth Horror is a Medium, uncommon figure.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150424-CobraFront.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150424-CobraFront_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>And here's a figure that no one outside the office has\
  \ seen yet, as we haven't taken him to any of our spring trade showsâ€”the Emperor\
  \ Cobra! Oversized snakes are a staple of fantasy fiction and gaming, and when it\
  \ came time to add our own to the ranks of prepainted plastic, I just knew we had\
  \ to go cobra. Inspired by Wayne Reynolds's cover illustration for <a href=\"/products/btpy82t5\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #9: Escape from Old Korvosa</em></a>, the Emperor\
  \ Cobra stands well higher than a Medium adventurer, and its open mouth promises\
  \ a nasty poison bite. He's even got a cool symbol on the back of his hood, as seen\
  \ below. The Emperor Cobra is a Large, uncommon figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150424-CobraBack.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150424-CobraBack_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>And that's it for my birthday favorites! Actually, there\
  \ are so many cool figures in this set that I could add a handful more, but hey,\
  \ I've got to make these previews last through June!</p> \n    <p>And now I leave\
  \ you as a broken old man, crippled with age and arthritis, shuffling off into the\
  \ slow decline into retirement.</p> \n    <p>Godspeed, all.</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br>\
