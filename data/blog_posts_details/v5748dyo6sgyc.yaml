  alt: "Halcyon Spells. Through hard study, Magaambyans can meld arcane and primal\
    \ spellcasting. Halcyon spells are spells from the arcane or primal spell list.\
    \ You don’t gain new halcyon spells via the normal means you typically use to\
    \ gain spells; instead, you gain new halcyon spells and new spell levels of halcyon\
    \ spells only through feats. Halcyon spells are prepared or cast just like other\
    \ spells granted by your class; for example, a wizard who gained halcyon spells\
    \ would add them to their spell list and their spellbook, while a sorcerer would\
    \ add them to their spell list and their spell repertoire. If you have more than\
    \ one arcane or primal spellcasting class, you add halcyon spells to all such\
    \ classes. Each time you cast a halcyon spell, decide whether it is an arcane\
    \ or primal spell. You can’t heighten a halcyon spell beyond your maximum spell\
    \ level of halcyon spell, even if you have higher-level spell slots, and you can’\
    t select a halcyon spell as a signature spell. Each time you gain a level and\
    \ learn new spells, and each time you gain a halcyon feat, you can swap out one\
    \ of your old halcyon spells for a different halcyon spell of the same level;\
    \ this is in addition to any swapping from your class, such as via a sorcerer’\
    s spell repertoire class feature. You can also swap out halcyon spells by retraining\
    \ during downtime. If you have a spellbook, when you swap out a halcyon spell,\
    \ you lose the spell from your spellbook entirely."

  alt: "Halcyon Speaker Dedication, Feat 6. Uncommon, Archetype, Dedication. Prerequisites:\
    \ Magaambyan Attendant Dedication, member of the Magaambya of conversant rank.\
    \ You devote much of your study to halcyon magic. You gain access to two common\
    \ Halcyon cantrips and two common 1st-level halcyon spells. In addition to being\
    \ able to cast your halcyon spells via your arcane or primal spell slots, you\
    \ also gain a 1st-level halcyon spell slot. You can use your halcyon spell slots\
    \ to spontaneously cast your halcyon spells. Special: You cannot select another\
    \ dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the halcyon speaker\
    \ archetype. Halcyon magic has been practiced by the Magaambya for a long time,\
    \ but the researchers and staff at the university aren’t content to rest on their\
    \ laurels. The Magaambya has plenty of teachers to pass down their current traditions,\
    \ but also continue researching ways that other traditions of magic might be combined:\
    \ arcane magic pulsing with the power of the divine, or occult secrets locked\
    \ away in ancient, primal monuments."

  alt: "Magaambyan Attendant Dedication, Feat 2. Uncommon, Archetype, Dedication.\
    \ Prerequisites: trained in Arcana or Nature, member of the Magaambya of attendant\
    \ rank. You devote much of your study to halcyon magic. You gain the ability to\
    \ cast a single arcane or primal cantrip of your choice, (as is normal for cantrips,\
    \ it is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level, rounded up). If\
    \ you weren’t already, you become trained in that tradition’s spell DCs and spell\
    \ attack rolls, with Intelligence as your spellcasting ability if you choose arcane\
    \ or Wisdom as your spellcasting ability if you choose primal. Regardless of whether\
    \ you choose an arcane or primal cantrip, you also either become trained in Arcana\
    \ or Nature, or an expert in one of those skills in which you were already trained.\
    \ When you gain this feat, choose to affiliate with the Cascade Bearers, Emerald\
    \ Boughs, Rain–Scribes, Tempest-Sun Mages, or Uzunjati. This grants you additional\
    \ feats available to only that branch. Special: You cannot select another dedication\
    \ feat other than Halcyon Speaker Dedication until you have gained two other feats\
    \ from the Magaambyan Attendant or halcyon speaker archetype."

  alt: "Mask Familiar, Feat 4. Archetype. Prerequisites: Magaambyan Attendant Dedication.\
    \ Your mask takes on a personality of its own, allowing it to serve as your familiar.\
    \ Though you can still wear it as a mask, you can detach it from your face to\
    \ grant it a bodily form of colored light that allows it to move around; usually,\
    \ this is a miniature form of the animal the mask represents. Detaching or reattaching\
    \ the familiar to transform it is a two-action activity. Even in mask form, the\
    \ familiar can move around on its master’s face and speaks in a distinct voice\
    \ (if it can talk). It is easily recognized as more than a simple mask unless\
    \ the familiar succeeds at a Deception check to Impersonate a mask. Other than\
    \ its appearance and the fact that it can be worn, it functions as other familiars.\
    \ Your mask familiar has access to the mask freeze familiar ability."
