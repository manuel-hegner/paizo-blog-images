  \ \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Over the past few months, we announced the\
  \ launch of the new season of Starfinder Society at Origins Game Faire and previewed\
  \ some of the PaizoCon 2018 organized play offerings, including our newest scenarios.\
  \ Tickets for events at Origins and Gen Con went live this past week, so this week's\
  \ blog focuses on offerings at those conventions.</p> \n     <h2>Origins Game Faire</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>In prior years, Pathfinder Society at Origins focused on a mix of older\
  \ season favorites with a sprinkling of the current season. This year, we've extended\
  \ that idea across Starfinder Society as well. Given that Starfinder Society doesn't\
  \ have the depth of scenarios, given that we are not even a full year into the campaign,\
  \ this means we scheduled the entire Starfinder Society catalog. So if you haven't\
  \ explored Absalom Station, sailed through the Drift, or met celebrity maven Zo!,\
  \ now is your chance.</p> \n     <p>As Starfinder Society developer Thurston Hillman\
  \ discussed in the <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo5lko6?Origins-Launching-into-a-New-Starfinder\"\
  >Starfinder Launch blog</a>, the limited release meant we hadn't finished the story\
  \ of the Scoured Stars. So instead of launching a new season with a new theme, we\
  \ are extending the Year of the Scoured Stars for another 12 months and pivoting\
  \ the storyline with the release of interactive special<a href=\"/products/btpya08y?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-1-99-The-Scoured-Stars-Invasion\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #1-99: The Scoured Stars Invasion</em></a>by veteran\
  \ Society writer Mikko Kallio. Thurston finished up development on this adventure\
  \ this week and from his reactions, players are in for a treat! Besides #1-99, we\
  \ have two new scenarios debuting at Origins—<a href=\"/products/btpya08w?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-1-16-Dreaming-of-the-Future\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #1-16: Dreaming of the Future</em></a> is a 4-part\
  \ quest pack for character levels 1-4 (replayable with 1st level characters) and\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpya08x?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-1-17-Reclaiming-the-TimeLost-Tear\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #1-17: Reclaiming the Time-Lost Tear</em></a>,\
  \ a continuation of the season metaplot involving the First Seeker [elect] Luwazi\
  \ Elsebo's mission to return to the Scoured Stars.</p> \n     <p>Pathfinder Society\
  \ players have the opportunity to experience the next installment of the modular\
  \ interactive special <a href=\"/products/btpy9y4i?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-899B-The-Solstice-Scar-Version-C\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-99C: The Solstice Scar, version C</em></a> on\
  \ Friday night. Besides a selection of offerings from Seasons 0-8, Season 9 scenarios\
  \ highlighting the Liberty's Edge, Concordance, and Dark Archive Factions are scheduled.\
  \ In addition, each block a Paizo staff member is running a table of <em>Pathfinder\
  \ Society Playtest Scenario #1: Rose Street Revenge</em>. That's so secret, there\
  \ isn't even a product page made for it yet. If you aren't able to get tickets to\
  \ one of the Rose Street tables, consider trying out a 2-hour Pathfinder Playtest\
  \ Demo.</p> \n     <p>Origins attendees need to purchase a badge and then purchase\
  \ tickets for each event they wish to participate in. Visit <a href=\"http://originsgamefaire.com\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">the Origins website</a> for more information on attending the\
  \ convention.</p> \n     <h2>Gen Con 2018</h2> \n     <p>The schedule at Gen Con\
  \ is choc-a-bloc with offerings. The latter half of Pathfinder Society Year of Faction's\
  \ Favor makes a showing, as well as the first three scenarios in the not-yet-announced\
  \ Season Ten storyline. Thursday sees an encore run of the modular interactive special\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9y4i?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-899B-The-Solstice-Scar-Version-C\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-99C: The Solstice Scar, version C</em></a>.\
  \ The interactive special <em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #10-00: The Hao-Jin Cataclysm</em>\
  \ makes its debut on Friday night.</p> \n     <p>On the Starfinder front, Saturday\
  \ night is the interactive special <a href=\"/products/btpya08y?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-1-99-The-Scoured-Stars-Invasion\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #1-99: The Scoured Stars Invasion</em></a>. Year\
  \ of Scoured Stars is well represented, including the debut of <a href=\"/products/btpya0dw?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-1-21-Yesteryears-Sorrow\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #1-20: Duskmire Accord 9</em></a> and <a href=\"\
  /products/btpya0dw?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-1-21-Yesteryears-Sorrow\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #1-21: Yesteryear's Sorrow</em></a>.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>Pathfinder Adventure Card Guild offerings include the PACG Open Tournament,\
  \ the interactive special <em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #10-00: The Hao-Jin Cataclysm</em>\
  \ on Friday night, and the launch of the newest Season (name to be announced at\
  \ PaizoCon). Plus tables of prior season play!</p> \n     <p>Prior years saw Paizo\
  \ staff participating in a wide range of panels and seminars in room 212 and this\
  \ year is no different. While we haven't posted the schedule yet (something about\
  \ a Playtest taking up quite a bit of time and attention) we are hoping to do so\
  \ in the very near future.</p> \n     <p>In looking at ticket sales, we have sold\
  \ out some events, including specific tiers in each of the interactive specials.\
  \ I'm working with the Gen Con events team to reallocate our GMs from less sold\
  \ events to sold out events and more tickets to sold out items should release shortly.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>We still have a need for Starfinder Society and Pathfinder Society GMs!\
  \ Volunteers receive benefits based on how many blocks they contribute. Rewards\
  \ include 4-day badges, 1/4 hotel rooms in the downtown Westin, credit to paizo.com,\
  \ a copy of a Paizo print product Interested? <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkem?A-Call-to-Vol-IIGen-Con-2018\"\
  \ target=\"_target\">Check here for more information and to complete a volunteer\
  \ questionnaire.</a></p> \n     <p>As with Origins, attendees at Gen Con must purchase\
  \ a badge and then buy tickets for each game they wish to participate in. We will\
  \ take generic tickets on a space available basis, so I encourage anyone to sign\
  \ up for the games they really want. <a href=\"http://gencon.com\" target=\"_blank\"\
  >For more info, check the Gen Con 2018 website.</a></p> \n     <p>Whew! So many\
  \ options, I'm glad I don't have to choose which to play! I'm looking forward to\
  \ a bustling convention season and hope to see many of you at a convention soon!</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Until next time—Explore, Report, Cooperate!</p> \n     <p>Tonya Woldridge<br>\
