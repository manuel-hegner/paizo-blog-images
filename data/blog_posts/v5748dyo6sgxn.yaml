  \ \n     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">We’ve got an exciting\
  \ array of products getting ready to release for you all, so I’m going to skip the\
  \ standard preamble and jump right into the juicy meat you all came here for: scenario\
  \ and quest descriptions!</p> \n      <p>Our first new Tier 1-4 scenario from author\
  \ Scott Young is <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq0217k?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-104-Bandits-of-Immenwood\"\
  >Pathfinder Society Scenario #1-04: The Immenwood Bandits</a>. While the PCs often\
  \ find themselves at the center of whatever calamity currently befalling agents\
  \ of the Society, this time they’re called in to help out another group of Pathfinders.\
  \ Returning from a research mission in Garund, a group of Pathfinder agents was\
  \ beset by all manner of catastrophes, from storms to wood-rot to beasts of the\
  \ sea. Barely surviving their journey they ran aground at a small village near Absalom\
  \ and managed to drag themselves to the Grand Lodge.</p> \n      <p>Steward of the\
  \ Grand Lodge Ambrus Valsin and Chief Archivist Zarta Dralneen request the PCs travel\
  \ to the town, near the Pathfinder's landing site, and escort a cart containing\
  \ the prior group’s discoveries through the Immenwood and safely back to Absalom.\
  \ What could possibly go wrong?</p> \n      <p> One thing to watch for in this release\
  \ is a sidebar update integrating the new Challenge Point scaling system from the\
  \ <a href=\"http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/encyclopedia/pfs2guide/\">Organized\
  \ Play Guide</a>. This integration departs from the way we previously formated our\
  \ adventures. We’d really like feedback from our GMs on whether these sidebars are\
  \ providing you with the tools you need to run these adventures in an organized\
  \ play environment. We've got a few weeks before we need to decided whether to change\
  \ our formatting in future products. Please post feedback in the comments below.\

  \ <p>Our next Tier 1-4 scenario, <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq0217l?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-105-Trailblazers-Bounty\"\
  >Pathfinder Society Scenario #1-05: Trailblazer’s Bounty</a>, takes us far away\
  \ from the Isle of Kortos, to the mountain ranges separating Isger and Molthune.\
  \ Cheliax’s aggressive tendencies over the past decade have not been overlooked\
  \ by the nation’s neighbors, and Druma, in particular, engages in a quiet trade\
  \ war that threatens to weaken Cheliax without giving the devil-run nation an excuse\
  \ to respond with military force. Instead, Chelish leadership seeks a different\
  \ resolution to their troubles: a state-sponsored bounty for the first group of\
  \ explorers to chart a safe trade route from their vassal state Isger to the nation\
  \ of Molthune in the north, creating a new passage that can bring economic prosperity\
  \ to both nations.</p> \n      <p> Not about to let the Pathfinders be outdone in\
  \ the finding of new paths, Calisro Benarry, leader of the Horizon Hunters faction\
  \ of the Society, called for the most intrepid explorers to take up the challenge\
  \ and chart this new route. Along the way, the PCs can expect dangerous wildlife,\
  \ fierce orcish warriors, and the treacherous mountain passes themselves. Moreover,\
  \ the PCs are not the only ones seeking to claim the Chelish bounty. Can the Pathfinders\
  \ live up to their name, or will they be buried by the dangers of the trail?</p>\

  \ final release this month is a Tier 1-4 quest, <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq0217m?Pathfinder-Society-Quest-2-Unforgiving-Fire\"\
  >Pathfinder Society Quest #2: Unforgiving Fire</a>, set near the island nation of\
  \ Jalmeray. Venture-Captain Rashmivati Melipdra was once, many years ago, a member\
  \ of the Monastery of Unblinking Flame. This connection allowed her the opportunity\
  \ to study many of the ancient monastery’s relics on behalf of the Pathfinder Society.\
  \ Unfortunately, not all has been going well for the ancient House of Perfection,\
  \ as a rogue monk stole a relic earmarked for study by the Society.</p> \n     \
  \ <p> Venture-Captain Melipdra calls for a group of volunteers willing to head to\
  \ the lawless port of Veedesha to retrieve the artifact, but the PCs may be in for\
  \ more than they bargained for. Ambitious and skilled, the rogue monk Meleeka opened\
  \ her own monastery to teach the more vicious and martially talented inhabitants\
  \ of Veedesha the techniques of Unforgiving Fire.</p> \n      <p>A special prize\
  \ awaits on this Chronicle sheet for those who manage to complete their mission\
  \ while upholding the Society’s ideals. Though this quest does not have specific\
  \ ties to the Envoy’s Alliance faction, PCs representing that group may find that\
  \ their goals and interests are uniquely suited to unlocking everything that this\
  \ quest has to offer!</p> \n      <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold;\
