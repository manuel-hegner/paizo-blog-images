              <h2>OPC Musings</h2>
              <p>Happy October! It’s fall, and the winds of change are blowing. When this blog is posted, I’ll be on a plane to Cincinnati for CinCityCon, and then in just a couple of weeks I’ll be headed to Asheville for Scarefest. I can’t wait to see you all! Getting to visit conventions is one of the best parts of my job; it really helps remind me why what I’m doing is important. If you’re in the area of either of these conventions, come on out and join us!</p>
              <p>Plenty to talk about this month so I won’t pontificate too much, let’s get right into it!</p>
              <p><br></p>
              <h2>New Boons</h2>
              <h3>Spooky Scary Skeletons (Send Shivers Down the Boon Store)</h3>
              <p>Back when&nbsp;<a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq029wb"><em>Book of the Dead</em></a>&nbsp;was sanctioned, we let you know that we had plans for allowing the skeleton ancestry in a limited capacity. Here, in the spookiest month, I’m delighted to announce that the time has come!</p>
              <p>Those of you who have already played&nbsp;<a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02du4"><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #4-02: Return to the Grave</em></a>&nbsp;know that, thanks to a recent expedition into the Gravelands, several skeletal adventurers were returned to Absalom. Those adventurers have elected to join us in the Pathfinder Society as they cope with their new existence!</p>
              <p>There is now a boon in the Achievement Point store called “Steadfast Refugee.” This boon costs 206 Achievement Points* and can only be purchased once per player. It allows you to build and play a skeleton adventurer who was traveling through Lastwall before meeting their untimely demise and rebirth</p>
              <p>Make no bones about it: while your character may be a skeleton, they are still expected to adhere to the ideals of the Pathfinder Society. They cannot be evil, and you as a player are expected to remember that other players have various tolerance for horror themes (not to mention that “playing the xylophone with your ribs” is funny a maximum of twice per session). Playing a skeletal character is naturally more perilous; other characters built for healing may not be able to heal you, so you may have to be more self-sufficient than normal.</p>
              <p>Other characters can also be assured that traveling with a skeletal Pathfinder does not violate their anathema in any way. Pharasma has been consulted on this one and while she’s not thrilled, she understands that these Pathfinders didn’t willingly become undead, so you are under no obligation to smite them on sight. PVP is still prohibited, even if your party member is using their own skull as a basilisk ball.</p>
              <p>*(get it, because that’s how many bones most humans have)</p>
              <h3>Condition Removal</h3>
              <p>We’ve also added a couple of new boons for condition removal in Pathfinder Society, based on requests from the community.</p>
              <p>First up, the Pathfinder Condition Removal boon is available for 20 AcP. It can heal a number of conditions that could also be removed by purchasing healing services with gold; however, it provides another avenue should your character find their coin purse a bit light as they slowly turn to stone. The full text is available on the FAQ page.</p>
              <p>Second is the Penitent Pathfinder boon! Since the beginning of the campaign, we’ve said that all characters have access to the&nbsp;<em>atone</em>&nbsp;ritual, should they violate their anathemas enough to require it. However, it’s been unclear how one learns the ritual or casts it, so we’ve simplified it. This 20 AcP boon provides the benefits of a successful&nbsp;<em>atone</em>&nbsp;ritual, provided your character still spends the 30 days of downtime in penance as required by the ritual.</p>
              <p><br></p>
              <h2>Sanctioning Updates</h2>
              <h3>Kingmaker Adventure Path</h3>
              <p>At long last, the&nbsp;<a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/kingmakerap">Kingmaker Adventure Path</a>&nbsp;arrives later this month! We’re all excited to bring you this update of one of our most beloved adventures, and I’m even more delighted to announce how sanctioning will work!</p>
              <p>This adventure is unlike any other. As a sandbox adventure in one volume, it’s nigh impossible for us to determine the exact points where Chronicle Sheets should be awarded to players… so we’re not going to. The sanctioning documents will include one generic Chronicle, which GMs are instructed to award to their players for every three levels your characters achieve. This means that once characters reach levels 4, 7, 10 and so on, a Chronicle Sheet will be awarded, up to a maximum of six. You can apply these to one character or spread them across multiple as usual.</p>
              <p>As a bonus, we’ll also be sanctioning the adventures in the&nbsp;<a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02e0m?Pathfinder-Kingmaker-Companion-Guide"><em>Kingmaker Companion Guide</em></a>! Sanctioning the&nbsp;<a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02d8j?Pathfinder-Dark-Archive">Dark Archive Case Files</a>&nbsp;has gone over well, and these small personal quests with your companions are complete enough to function as standalone adventures as well. You may also find that completing these adventures unlocks new options from your companions as well…</p>
              <p>All these sanctioning documents will be posted on the product pages prior to street date later this month. We hope you all enjoy this new iteration of the adventure!</p>
              <h3>Starfinder Adventures</h3>
              <p>In addition to Kingmaker, we’ve got two Starfinder adventures ready for sanctioning this month! Both the&nbsp;<a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02c0y?Starfinder-Adventure-Path-Dead-Suns"><em>Dead Suns Adventure Path</em></a>&nbsp;compilation and the final volume of the&nbsp;<a href="https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/adventures/adventurePath/driftCrashers">Drift Crashers Adventure Path</a>&nbsp;release this month. Sanctioning documents and Chronicle Sheets for both will be posted by the end of the month as well!</p>
              <p>The&nbsp;<em>Dead Suns Adventure Path</em>&nbsp;will be very similar to the previous sanctioning for the six-volume iteration, and you’ll see many of the same boons as well. There’s no new rules content in this book, so you won’t see a new entry on the&nbsp;<a href="https://paizo.com/starfindersociety/characteroptions">Character Options page</a>, though ownership of this compilation gives you access to any character options published in it. The Drift Crashers Adventure Path will be added to the Character Options page at the end of the month as normal.</p>
              <h3>Sanctioning Rule Updates</h3>
              <p>Finally in sanctioning news, we have two rule updates to announce. First, we’ve updated the text on the&nbsp;<a href="https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/characteroptions">Pathfinder Society Character Options page</a>&nbsp;to be clearer about how one gains access to an option printed in a Pathfinder Adventure or Adventure Path. Previously, the rule could be read incorrectly to mean that all characters had access to anything printed in an Adventure. The new text has been added to the Character Options page and is quoted below, which should hopefully be clearer to all!</p>
              <p><strong>Using Options from Pathfinder Adventures or Adventure Paths</strong><br>
                Typically, characters cannot select options from a Pathfinder Adventure. However, Chronicle Sheets from sanctioned Adventures or boons from the Achievement Points store often grant characters access to options from these Adventures.</p>
              <p>Ownership of Adventures or Adventure Paths is not required for Character Option use in the Pathfinder Society campaign, as long as rules are referenced from the&nbsp;<a href="http://paizo.com/prd">official Pathfinder Reference Document (prd)</a>.</p>
              <p>Second, with the release of the Kingmaker Adventure Path comes our first foray into producing content in-house for “the world’s oldest RPG!” We wanted to give our dedicated players a way to earn Pathfinder Society credit for running this content, even if their gaming group might be a little reluctant to switch systems. As such, the following text has been added to the Guide to Organized Play:</p>
              <p>If Paizo has released an official conversion of a sanctioned adventure to another game system (such as the ''Pathfinder Kingmaker Bestiary (5e)'' or ''Pathfinder Adventure Path: Abomination Vaults (5e)''), GMs and players may play these adventures using those rules and earn credit as if they had played it using Pathfinder rules. Adventures that have not been converted by Paizo in this way must be played using standard Adventure Mode rules.</p>
              <p><br></p>
              <h2>GM Recognition</h2>
              <h3>Campaign Service Coins</h3>
              <p>We award Campaign Service Coins to members of the community who have gone above and beyond to provide an exceptional program to the community at large. Campaign Coins are awarded based on nominations; if you believe someone in your community is deserving of this award (whether or not they are a Venture Officer), send an email to organizedplay[at]paizo[dot]com with their name and reasons.</p>
              <p>This month, several RVCs were able to award Campaign Coins on my behalf at Hurricon, SkålCon, and SydCon. Congratulations to:</p>
              <p><strong>Shane Murphy</strong>, who now holds a Campaign Coin and Organized Play ID&nbsp;<strong>#864</strong><br><strong>Greg Ferguson</strong>, who now holds a Campaign Coin and Organized Play ID&nbsp;<strong>#865</strong><br><strong>Sandra Wilkinson</strong>, who now holds a Campaign Coin and Organized Play ID&nbsp;<strong>#867</strong><br><strong>Ryan Blomquist</strong>, who now holds a Campaign Coin and Organized Play ID<strong>&nbsp;#871</strong></p>
              <h3>GM Ranks</h3>
              <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the 5th milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains (program dependent). A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th milestone is 650 hours!</p>
              <p>This month, we had one GM earn their 5th Star for PFS1, two GMs earn their 5th Nova for SFS, and three GMs earn their 5th Glyph for PFS2.</p>
              <p><strong>5th Star (PFS1)</strong>: Kyle Ashcraft<br><strong>5th Nova (SFS)</strong>: Milan Badzic, Jim Crase<br><strong>5th Glyph (PFS2)</strong>: Brad Fiske, Ivis Flanagan, Shannon Steward</p>
              <p>I want to recognize Milan Badzic in particular. He is, to the best of my knowledge, the first person to complete the Triple Crown, having earned the 5th rank in Pathfinder Society (first edition), Pathfinder Society (second edition), and Starfinder Society. That’s no easy feat, and I truly don’t know if we’ll see it matched anytime soon. Congratulations, Milan, and please enjoy some time off, you’ve earned it!</p>
              <p><br></p>
              <h2>Conventions</h2>
              <p>As I mentioned at the top, I’ll be attending CinCityCon and Scarefest this October, and I’ll also be joining the Minnesota crew at&nbsp;<a href="https://warhorn.net/events/skalconline-2022">SkålCOnline</a>&nbsp;in November for some Dark Archive weirdness. But as the year closes out, we’ve got plenty of events, both online and in-person, for you to finish strong! Check out our&nbsp;<a href="https://paizo.com/conventions">convention calendar</a>&nbsp;for all the latest listings.</p>
              <p>Until next time—Explore! Report! Cooperate! And have a spooktacular month!</p>
