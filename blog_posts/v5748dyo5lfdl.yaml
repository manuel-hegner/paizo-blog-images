  >I'm visiting family in Minnesota this week, but even the ties of blood cannot stop\
  \ the inexorable march of <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder Battles</a>\
  \ previews! This week we continue our look at this month's <a href=\"/products/btpy909j\"\
  >Legends of Golarion</a> set of prepainted plastic miniatures. Unlike previous sets\
  \ like <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy8rqs\">Rise of the Runelords</a>,\
  \ <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy8v0b\">Shattered Star</a>, or <a href=\"\
  http://paizo.com/products/btpy8xg6\">Skull &amp; Shackles</a>, <a href=\"/products/btpy909j\"\
  >Legends of Golarion</a> does not focus on a specific <a href=\"http://paizo.com/pathfinder/adventurePath\"\
  >Pathfinder Adventure Path</a>. Rather, the set travels around the whole of Golarion\
  \ to cover monsters and characters from the entire breadth of Pathfinder products.</span></p>\
  \ \n    <p>This week, we travel back to one of the earliest adversaries ever to\
  \ appear in a Pathfinder product: KOBOLDS! These little buggers appeared in the\
  \ now-classic Nick Logue adventure <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy7yqz\"\
  >Crown of the Kobold King</a>, a module so early that it predates the official birth\
  \ of the Pathfinder brand itself. The scheming Kobold King was one of Paizo's first\
  \ archvillains, even eventually coming back from the dead to hound player characters\
  \ in the free adventure <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy83w1\">Revenge of\
  \ the Kobold King</a>. Given all that, we thought he made a great candidate for\
  \ inclusion in <a href=\"/products/btpy909j\">Legends of Golarion</a>, along with\
  \ several of his (un)trusty kobold servitors.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-KoboldKing.jpg\"><img\
  \ src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-KoboldKing_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Here he is in all his scaly glory, the Kobold King\
  \ Merlokrep himself! This fighter/sorcerer, the scourge of Falcon's Hollow, is one\
  \ buff dude. WizKids did a great job with his physique, his cool crown, and his\
  \ armor and cape. This Small, rare figure definitely commands the respect he deserves.</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-KoboldArcher.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-KoboldArcher_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Here we have the Kobold Archer, a black-scaled sniper\
  \ ready to put an arrow into the eye (or perhaps more likely, the kneecap) of your\
  \ player characters. If you doubt his deadeye aim, do your best not to pay attention\
  \ to the human skull hanging from his quiver. The Kobold Archer is a Small common\
  \ figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-KoboldWarrior.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-KoboldWarrior_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Straight from the pages of the <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy8auu\"\
  >Pathfinder Bestiary</a> comes this spear-wielding soldier. The Kobold Warrior is\
  \ a Small common figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-KoboldMystic.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-KoboldMystic_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>This green-skinned Kobold Mystic (clearly\
  \ an alchemist) comes complete with a potion in both the hand AND the tail, so you\
  \ know he's ready to carpet bomb any attackers. The paint job on this guy is really\
  \ superlative, and I can't wait to field him against my players. \"Oh nooo. I kobold.\
  \ I'm soooo scar—BOOM!\" The Kobold Mystic is a Small uncommon figure.</p> \n  \
  \  <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-KoboldChieftain.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-KoboldChieftain_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>The last kobold today is the Kobold Chieftain,\
  \ a shamanistic ruler that easily doubles as some kind of cleric or mystic. Watch\
  \ out for his spear, his bone club, and his overall nasty disposition. The Kobold\
  \ Chieftain is a Small uncommon figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n\
  \     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-Slurk.jpg\"><img src=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71244-Slurk_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n \
  \   </div> \n    <p>Since the set has so many kobolds, I wanted to sneak in a Paizo-original\
  \ creature that goes right along with them—the Slurk! Long ago, dwarves bred subterranean\
  \ toads to create the ultimate beasts of burden, but things did not work out as\
  \ intended. Slurks exude a stinky, sticky slime making them repulsive to dwarves.\
  \ Since kobolds are already repulsive, they took to the creatures and use them as\
  \ mounts. My favorite thing about the Slurk miniature is that the whole thing was\
  \ cast in clear plastic, and you can really see the slime dripping off its skin.\
  \ Ewww! The Slurk is a Medium uncommon figure.</p> \n    <p>That's it for this week!\
  \ Stay tuned to this space next Friday for another <a href=\"/products/btpy909j\"\
  >Legends of Golarion</a> preview containing never-before-seen figures from the set!\
  \ See you then!</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p> \n   </div> \n \
