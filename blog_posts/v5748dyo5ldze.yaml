  \ Maps</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, October 16, 2012</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"\
  articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">When I'm not working on the\
  \ next upcoming hardback rulebook, or apps, or whatever needs to be done around\
  \ this place, my mind is on maps. While the talented Jason Engle makes our Flip-Mat\
  \ and Map Packs gorgeous, I'm the guy who dreams up what goes on those maps and\
  \ how they work together. And that's a fun job!</span></p> \n    <div class=\"blurb120\"\

  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>For the past year and a half I've been\
  \ working hard to make these lines as fun and useful as possible. I've worked to\
  \ make many of our Map Packs more modular, so that you, the GM, can build the kind\
  \ of complexes and adventure sites that dance around your imagination. I've also\
  \ been working to create synergies (excuse my use of such an overused and often\
  \ misused term) among these products whenever possible.</p> \n    <p>For example,\
  \ if you have both <a href=\"/products/btpy8sa1\"><i>Map Pack: Marketplace</i></a>\
  \ and <a href=\"/products/btpy8ssg\"><i>Map Pack: Rooftops</i></a>, you'll notice\
  \ that you can use them to create large and evocative city spaces. I like running\
  \ urban adventures, and I'm a sucker for mapping aids that will help me illustrate\
  \ the twisting alleyways that serve as the stage for a chase, gang war, or a run-in\
  \ with local bravos with more guts than brains. When we put these products on the\
  \ schedule I wanted to create the product that I always wanted, and that I figured\
  \ a lot of you would want too.</p> \n    <p>But there are other types of synergies\
  \ within current mapping products. Lately we have worked to have some of our maps\
  \ fit well with some of our Adventure Paths. The latest ship maps provide the layout\
  \ for the chief vessels the PCs command in the Skull &amp; Shackles Adventure Path,\
  \ and <a href=\"/products/btpy8s9x\"><i>Flip-Mat: Town Square</i></a> provides two\
  \ chief encounter locations within the town of Sandpoint for those of you running\
  \ Rise of the Runelords. The goal of this type of synergy is to give a tool to GMs\
  \ who are running Adventure Paths, without making the maps so specific that they're\
  \ hard to use for those GMs who aren't.</p> \n    <p>The question I pose to you\
  \ all on this fine autumn Tuesday is, \"Are we on the right track?\" Do you like\
  \ the synergies in the mapping products? Have you noticed them? Are we going far\
  \ enough? Let me know your mind on this matter and help me to create the best products\
  \ for your Pathfinder game.</p> \n    <p>Stephen Radney-MacFarland<br> <i>Designer</i></p>\
