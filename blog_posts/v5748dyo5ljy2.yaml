  \ \n     </div> \n     <p>Since we launched the world of Golarion and the Pathfinder\
  \ RPG, I have eagerly awaited the day when I could announce a single-player computer\
  \ RPG based on our game and world. Many companies have approached me over the years,\
  \ but the fit was never quite right.</p> \n     <p>Last year, our friends at Obsidian\
  \ connected us to the folks at Owlcat Games, who had some interesting ideas for\
  \ a Kingmaker CRPG. Owlcat wanted to meet us at Gen Con and show us what they had\
  \ in mind. I was expecting maybe a Powerpoint presentation, but they brought a work\
  \ in progress. To say I was blown away was an understatement. They had clearly put\
  \ a lot of time, effort, and thought into everything—and we hadn't even signed a\
  \ deal yet! I ran around the convention finding various Paizo employees to look\
  \ at it, and everyone got super excited. We started work on a licensing deal right\
  \ away.</p> \n     <p>A couple months ago, Owlcat came to the Paizo offices to show\
  \ us a vertical slice of <em>Pathfinder: Kingmaker</em>. A vertical slice is a small\
  \ segment of how the finished game is going to look and play. We were all mesmerized\
  \ playing the game, which was filled with a ton of familiar Golarion hooks in the\
  \ artwork and mechanics. A lucky few of you at PaizoCon 2017 had the opportunity\
  \ to play through a similar vertical slice, and all the feedback we received was\
  \ super positive.</p> \n     <p>I need to tell you a little bit about Owlcat Games.\
  \ They're a new development studio, but don't take that to mean they're inexperienced!\
  \ Some of them have been together for more than a decade, and the list of games\
  \ they've helped create is strong. They have the backing of one of the largest game\
  \ companies around, so you don't need to worry about their stability. And you definitely\
  \ don't need to worry about their enthusiasm for Pathfinder—they're longtime gamers,\
  \ and have several different tabletop Pathfinder campaigns running in their office.\
  \ They know the setting, the story, and the rules as well as anyone. And they've\
  \ been joined by CRPG legend Chris Avellone, who is infusing his touch of story\
  \ genius into our now-classic Adventure Path.</p> \n     <p>Owlcat Games has the\
  \ full backing of their parent company to make the game to the specifications that\
  \ we had approved, but they have a lot of great ideas beyond that spec, so they\
  \ decided to launch a Kickstarter that's all about making it bigger and more awesome—\
  more sidequests, more companions, more options, more <i>depth</i>.</p> \n     <p>A\
  \ great Pathfinder computer RPG is something that I have personally waited a decade\
  \ for, and I couldn't be more excited to see it come to fruition.</p> \n    </blockquote>\
  \ \n    <p>The kickstarter is headed towards it's next stretch goal at $700K, where\
  \ a new chapter to reveal hidden secrets of original Kingmaker story will be added,\
  \ as well as support for <b><i>both Mac and Linux</i></b>. Check out the <a href=\"\
