  > \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">It's that time of year again, we're beginnig\
  \ to announce details for the next <a href=\"/rpgsuperstar\">RPG Superstar™</a>\
  \ contest! Every year, Paizo holds an annual open-call RPG design competition to\
  \ give the best and brightest aspiring game designers a chance to show the world\
  \ their talent. This year, we're going to be shaking things up a bit.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>For starters, I'll be acting as your host throughout the contest. For those\
  \ of you who have no idea who I am, my name is Owen K.C. Stephens and I was brought\
  \ on as a developer by Paizo earlier this year. I work primarily on the <a href=\"\
  /pathfinder/modules\">Pathfinder Modules</a> and <a href=\"/pathfinder/companion\"\
  >Pathfinder Player Companion</a> lines, and I have a long history of writing for\
  \ Paizo on a number of products. Since the prize for winning RPG Superstar™ is an\
  \ adventure we'll publish in one of our RPG Modules, I'm getting involved in the\
  \ contest early and will be helping oversee it this year.</p> \n     <p>The contest\
  \ itself is going to be ramping up the degree of difficulty in several rounds as\
  \ a result of how consistently amazing the entries have been year after year. We're\
  \ convinced the talent pool exists to make several of the stages tougher than previous\
  \ years, and that the best contestants are going to thrive under the pressure. That\
  \ shouldn't discourage anyone from entering! Instead, think of this as an even better\
  \ test of your skills. Anyone who makes it to the last few rounds of this year's\
  \ contest should be confident they have what it takes to get work in the tabletop\
  \ RPG industry.</p> \n     <p>What won't change is the core concept and processes\
  \ we've developed over several years of RPG Superstar™. We have some surprises for\
  \ you, and some rounds will have new challenges, but things will seem very familiar\
  \ to fans who have followed the contest for several years. Where things significantly\
  \ change from previous contests, I'll provide extra guidance on how we envision\
  \ the round going, and why we made the change.</p> \n     <p>The first big change:\
  \ entries for Open Call are <b>not</b> wondrous items, as they have been in every\
  \ other year of the contest. Instead we're asking contestants to create a magic\
  \ item from one of the following categories: armor, shield, weapon, staff, ring,\
  \ or rod. As always, the magic item should conform to the rules and format given\
  \ in the <a href=\"/products/btpy88yj\"><em>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</em></a>\
  \ for items of that type. In the case of a magic suit of armor, shield, or weapon,\
  \ it should be an example of a specific armor, shield, or weapon, rather than one\
  \ created by adding magic special abilities. Think <i>breastplate of command</i>\
  \ and <i>life-drinker</i>, rather than a <i>+1 ghost touch chain shirt</i> or <i>+1\
  \ keen flaming bastard sword</i>. Further if you decide to do a magic staff make\
  \ sure you have a concept that elevates it above a \"spell-in-a-can\" with multiple\
  \ spells. We are, after all, looking for Superstars!</p> \n     <p>We're making\
  \ this change to the first round for a number of reasons. First, we want to strongly\
  \ encourage contestants to create something new, rather than re-submitting an item\
  \ they've used in previous years (even if they've modified it since then). Secondly,\
  \ we want to see how well people can do with a surprise and a tight deadline. Writing\
  \ in the RPG industry is often done with short schedules and sometimes the needs\
  \ of a project change after you've already started working on it. By shaking things\
  \ up in the first round, we'll get finalists who know they can handle the chaos\
  \ and pressure of writing for RPG projects in real-world conditions.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>Open Call is otherwise very much as past years. The open call begins today,\
  \ and you need to have your entry in by December 16 at 2:00 PM Pacific time. We'll\
  \ be maintaining public voting for these initial entries as we've done for the past\
  \ 2 years. So your magic item will initially be judged by being presented to voters\
  \ along with another randomly determined item. That means if you submit a magic\
  \ ring it'll be compared to many items that aren't rings, so be sure you present\
  \ something that can stand up to competition in any form. The top 32 items will\
  \ be determined by the community along with feedback and oversight from our judges\
  \ for this round, and those 32 competitors will face other game design challenges\
  \ in the remaining rounds of the competition!</p> \n     <p>So loosen up your creative\
  \ muscles, start crafting a magic item, and get ready to be the next <a href=\"\
  /rpgsuperstar\">RPG Superstar™</a>!</p> \n     <p>Owen K. C. Stephens<br> <i>Developer\
  \ and RPG Superstar Host</i></p> \n    </div> \n   </blockquote> <!-- tags: RPG\
