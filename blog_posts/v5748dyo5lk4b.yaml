  \  </div> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">It has certainly been an exciting and\
  \ successful launch for Starfinder and the Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild.\
  \ With Gen Con 50 behind us, the Organized Play team thought it was a good idea\
  \ to take a bit of a look at the organization that defines our living campaign:\
  \ the Starfinder Society.</p> \n     <h2>Starfinder Society History</h2> \n    \
  \ <p>Much of the established background for the Starfinder Society can be found\
  \ in the <a href=\"/products/btpy9ssr?Starfinder-Core-Rulebook\"><em>Starfinder\
  \ Core Rulebook</em></a> and the <a href=\"/products/btpy9vlp?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Guide\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild Guide</em></a>. Both of these resources\
  \ provide overviews of the Starfinder Society, with the Roleplaying Guild Guide\
  \ focusing more on recent events and serving as a direct lead-in to our current\
  \ story line: the Year of Scoured Stars.</p> \n     <p>Sufficed to say, the Starfinder\
  \ Society is reminiscent of the Pathfinder Society of old. In fact, much of the\
  \ Starfinder Society is based on incomplete notes and hidden records relating to\
  \ the Pathfinder Society. Both organizations are, for example, based around the\
  \ concept of exploration, with the Starfinder Society having begun as a group keenly\
  \ interested in exploring the mysterious event known as the Gap. The first Starfinders\
  \ explored a galaxy made recently accessible thanks to the advent of Drift travel,\
  \ seeking to chart the temporal edges of the Gap and figure out what they could\
  \ about this setting-defining event. The audacity of such an endeavor brought many\
  \ interested parties into the Society's fold, and during these early years, the\
  \ Society flourished.</p> \n     <p>When it became evident that the Gap was not\
  \ something that could be solved with a few decades of research, the Starfinder\
  \ Society branched out to other avenues of exploration. They strove to reconnoiter\
  \ the very fringes of reality and beyond, bringing back alien technologies and filling\
  \ servers with the records of previously undiscovered species. This renaissance\
  \ of exploration, involving far more organizations than just the Starfinder Society,\
  \ brought with it a terrible price: the Stardust Plague. This pathogen slew millions\
  \ across the Pact Worlds and led to strict quarantine rules for any operation partaking\
  \ in extra-solar expeditions.</p> \n     <p>Expect to see more light shed on the\
  \ Society's history (especially that of the Exo-Guardians faction) in this month's\
  \ scenario, <em>Starfinder Society #1-04: Cries from the Drift</em>.</p> \n    \

  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <h2>Starfinder Society Leadership</h2> \n     <p>The Starfinder\
  \ Society is divided into several tiers of leadership that largely departs from\
  \ its Pathfinder Society predecessor. The various venture-captains form the informal\
  \ base of leadership within the Starfinder Society. These experienced Starfinders\
  \ tend to the numerous Society lodges in the galaxy and present field agents with\
  \ their missions.</p> \n     <p>The Forum is an elected body of Starfinders that\
  \ manages the Starfinder Society as a governing force, voting on the allocation\
  \ of resources, the elevation of Starfinder field agents to special positions, and\
  \ finally, holding a vote to decide the future direction of the Starfinder Society\
  \ in the form of the First Seeker. Unlike the masked Decemvirate group from Pathfinder\
  \ Society, knowledge of the Forum's membership is open information. Sufficed to\
  \ say, several faction leaders, venture-captains, and even some notable Starfinders\
  \ are members of the Forum.</p> \n     <p>The First Seeker is the elected leader\
  \ of the Starfinder Society, and it's this person's proposed initiatives that shape\
  \ the current overarching mission for the Starfinder Society. As we have discussed\
  \ in <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ljyy?Faction-Overview-Second-Seekers\">previous\
  \ blogs</a>, the First Seeker gives us an in-setting reason to transition between\
  \ the storylines our seasons present. When we had our first meetings about establishing\
  \ what the various roles meant for the Society, I remember (alongside John and Tonya)\
  \ explaining the First Seeker's term as being a temporary position, which they abdicate\
  \ once their stated mission is complete. Many First Seekers have died in pursuit\
  \ of their respective missions, and for those who succeed… well, that depends on\
  \ the specific mission and temperament of the given First Seeker. In our final pitch\
  \ for this concept, I equated a First Seeker's departure as being like the “The\
  \ Long Walk” from a certain post-apocalyptic comic series—I think only Erik Mona\
  \ caught that reference.</p> \n     <p>The previous First Seeker was a kasathan\
  \ named of Jadnura, who led the Starfinder Society on its disastrous mission into\
  \ the trinary star system known as the Scoured Stars. Following the disappearance\
  \ of Jadnura, the Society held together under the leadership of its current nominated\
  \ First Seeker, Luwazi Elsebo. Expect to see some movement on Luwazi's (as well\
  \ as our overall season's) major storyline in next month's scenario, <em>Starfinder\
  \ Society #1-05: The First Mandate</em></p> \n     <p>Finally, we have the enigmatic\
  \ assembly of uploaded intelligences known as Guidance. This amalgam of uploaded\
  \ Starfinder consciousnesses, makes its debut in <a href=\"/products/btpy9tsw?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-101-The-Commencement\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society #1-01: The Commencement</em></a>. Beyond its role in that\
  \ scenario, as well as its current refusal to fully declare Luwazi Elsebo as First\
  \ Seeker (she is only the nominated First Seeker, after all), there is not much\
  \ to say about Guidance right now.</p> \n     <p class=\"tiny\"><i>Insidious finger\
  \ tapping...</i></p> \n     <div class=\"blurb180\">\n      <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/PZOSFS0101E-Guidance.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/Starfinder/PZOSFS0101E-Guidance_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <h2>The Lorespire Complex</h2> \n     <p>The Lorespire\
  \ Complex is the home of the Starfinder Society on Absalom Station, not to mention\
  \ the organization's primary base of operations. Thanks to the effect of the mysterious\
  \ Starstone, Starfinders from across the galaxy can return to the Lorespire Complex\
  \ in only a handful of days. Much of the Starfinder Society's success is directly\
  \ related to maintaining this prime real estate onboard the Pact World's most important\
  \ installation.</p> \n     <p>Countless chambers and meeting halls fill the Lorespire\
  \ Complex, including well-known areas like the First Seeker Ilyastre Memorial Museum,\
  \ or the formal Skyreach Room gala hall. The Lorespire Complex also houses countless\
  \ Starfinders and visiting dignitaries in pristine dormitories. Beyond the eponymous\
  \ spire, other structures cover the greater campus. The Archives contain the Society's\
  \ incredible wealth of physical assets, along with vast data vaults ostensibly under\
  \ the watchful eye of Historia-7 and her Dataphiles. The Hall of Discovery houses\
  \ the elected Forum and First Seeker during their regular debates and meeting to\
  \ steer the Starfinder Society. Other less known—or simply avoided—installations\
  \ exist on the grounds of the Lorespire Complex, including the holding cells of\
  \ the Adamantine Bastille, the mystical communication devices of the Communion Vaults,\
  \ and the deadly proving grounds known only as the Perplexity.</p> \n     <p>Well,\
  \ I hope that this additional insight into the Starfinder Society and its base of\
  \ operations proved useful. I for one can't wait to share more news about our upcoming\
  \ plans and scenarios in the weeks and months to come. Look forward to our next\
  \ Starfinder Society blog, where I talk about a scenario that really proves why\
  \ space can be a dangerous place...</p> \n     <p>Until next time!</p> \n     <p>Thurston\
