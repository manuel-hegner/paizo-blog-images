  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>It's time for the second installment in the new blog\
  \ series I started two months ago with <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5li3h\"><em>Beyond\
  \ the Pool of Stars</em></a>, in which I explain why I commissioned each new Pathfinder\
  \ Tales novel, and what made me fall in love with it.</p> \n     <p>This month,\
  \ we're looking at <a href=\"/products/btpy9e43\"><em>Bloodbound</em></a>, a book\
  \ that's both harder and easier to write about than any other—because its author\
  \ is none other than Paizo Editor-in-Chief F. Wesley Schneider!</p> \n     <p itemprop=\"\
  description\">Wes and I have been working together—and writing together—for more\
  \ than a decade at this point. Fun fact: While Wes had previously published adventures\
  \ with other companies before he started here, we both made our first adventure\
  \ sale to <em>Dungeon</em> in the same issue—and the same adventure! We co-wrote\
  \ \"Shut-In\" in <em>Dungeon</em> #128, and teamed up again on \"The Lightless Depths\"\
  \ in the <em>Savage Tide Adventure Path</em>. Though creative differences on the\
  \ latter almost resulted in parking lot knife-fights, I've learned a ton from him\
  \ over the years, and I like to think he'd say the same for me. (Though probably\
  \ not if I'm in the room—we have to maintain <i>some</i> standards.)</p> \n    \
  \ <div class=\"blurb360\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8350-Larsa.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8350-Larsa_360.jpeg\"></a>\n     \
  \ <br><i>Illustration by Roberto Pitturru</i>\n     </div> \n     <p>So when we\
  \ started publishing Pathfinder fiction, I encouraged him to audition. It can be\
  \ intimidating to try something new under the eyes of your colleagues—just because\
  \ we work here doesn't give any of us a free pass to a novel, and we're often each\
  \ other's harshest critics—but Wes persevered. He started out with a web fiction\
  \ story, <a href=\"/pathfinder/tales/serial/shatteredSteel\">\"Shattered Steel.\"\
  </a> Then he wrote the Pathfinder's Journal <a href=\"/products/btpy8qgc\"><em>Guilty\
  \ Blood</em></a> (also starring Ailson Kindler) in the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/carrionCrown\"\
  ><em>Carrion Crown Adventure Path</em></a>. At that point, I knew without doubt\
  \ that he could write an amazing novel, and told him as much.</p> \n     <p>I'll\
  \ let Wes talk about the more than two years that passed between the final outline\
  \ of <a href=\"/products/btpy9e43\"><em>Bloodbound</em></a> and the completion of\
  \ its manuscript, but suffice to say, Wes worked <i>extremely</i> hard on this book,\
  \ and it shows. The dialogue is snappy. The landscape—Ustalav, of course—is lovingly\
  \ rendered, providing the perfect introduction to the gothic cities and streets\
  \ Wes has been building for years. The characters are fun and compelling—and not\
  \ just the protagonists! The book focuses on Larsa (illustrated here), a royal investigator\
  \ and dhampir, and Jadain, a young priestess of Pharasma, as they track down a deadly\
  \ rogue vampire. As you might expect, their odd-couple dynamic is fascinating. (After\
  \ all, Pharasma hates undead, but a dhampir's only <i>part</i> dead... right?) Yet\
  \ my favorite characters were the side characters—the crotchety former adventurer\
  \ Ailson Kindler, and the delightfully snarky, foppish vampire Considine. (Seriously,\
  \ if you like characters like Seltyiel—or Wes himself, for that matter—you're going\
  \ to <i>love</i> Considine.)</p> \n     <p>So now, many years after we first started\
  \ talking about it, <a href=\"/products/btpy9e43\"><em>Bloodbound</em></a> is out\
  \ in the world. I couldn't be prouder of how the book turned out, nor of Wes for\
  \ writing it (even if it <i>does</i> rob <a href=\"/products/btpy94r3\"><em>The\
  \ Redemption Engine</em></a> of the coveted \"longest Pathfinder novel ever\" award).</p>\
  \ \n     <p>I hope you enjoy the book as much as I did—and if you check it out,\
  \ please post reviews! Books live or die on the strength of their reviews, and this\
  \ one deserves a long life (though as Considine shows us, undeath is pretty okay,\
  \ too).</p> \n     <p style=\"clear: both;\">James L. Sutter<br> <i>Executive Editor</i></p>\
