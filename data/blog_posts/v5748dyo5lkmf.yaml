  \     </div> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">The newest entry in the exciting\
  \ saga of Pathfinder comics hits the web and comic book stores tomorrow. This issue,\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpya020?Pathfinder-Spiral-of-Bones-1\">Spiral of Bones #1</a>,\
  \ not only kicks off a gripping new five-part storyline, but it also marks the Pathfinder\
  \ comics debut of our very own Crystal Frasier!</p> \n     <p>She's already done\
  \ a few interviews with external media sites, like <a href=\"https://www.comiccrusaders.com/interview-rolling-the-dice-with-spiral-of-bones-writer-crystal-frasier/\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Comic Crusaders</a>, <a href=\"http://majorspoilers.com/2018/01/24/interview-crystal-frasier-on-the-upcoming-pathfinder-spiral-of-bones-arc/\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Major Spoilers</a>, <a href=\"https://www.firstcomicsnews.com/rich-interviews-crystal-frasier-writer-for-pathfinder-spiral-of-bones/\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">First Comics News</a>, and <a href=\"http://knowdirectionpodcast.com/2018/02/know-direction-172-interview-with-paizos-crystal-frasier/\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Know Direction</a>. But these are mostly aimed toward the general\
  \ comic fan rather than readers already familiar with Pathfinder, its characters,\
  \ and its world. I sat down with Crystal to ask a few questions that seemed particularly\
  \ pressing for existing Pathfinder fans—a paizo.com exclusive!</p> \n     <blockquote>\
  \ \n      <p style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">As a Pathfinder developer,\
  \ you have a wide breadth of knowledge about the setting, its characters, and its\
  \ ongoing plots. What inspired you to write this story, set here, and involving\
  \ these characters?</p> \n      <p>I love the ways that roleplaying game settings\
  \ are unique from other fictional settings, and one of the big ways that Pathfinder\
  \ is so unique is the lackadaisical nature of death. Heroes come back from the dead\
  \ all the time—all you need is a diamond and a friendly cleric. But what kind of\
  \ world does that give you in practice, and what's death like while you're there?\
  \ Valeros gets to look at that up close, and as our most... non-miraculous iconic,\
  \ he's the perfect audience insert for encountering and reacting to this planar\
  \ weirdness, while getting some of it explained for the lay fighter or casual reader.</p>\
  \ \n      <p style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">Kaer Maga creator\
  \ and former Paizo editor, James L. Sutter, makes a cameo appearance in a crowd\
  \ on the opening page of this issue. What other Easter eggs can fans of Pathfinder\
  \ and Paizo hope to find in this or later issues in the series?</p> \n      <p>There\
  \ are a few here and there in the first issue, but none quite as big as Sutter grinning\
  \ at the camera like a film extra. The remainder for issue 1 are mostly nods to\
  \ fun setting elements, like the goblin love of pickles or classic cloaker paranoia.\
  \ We get a little more free with the cameos in book 2; once Valeros is wandering\
  \ around the afterlife we get to have a little fun by dropping in other characters\
  \ from previous comics—many of them killed by or near Valeros.</p> \n      <p style=\"\
  font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">This story arc features some crazy locations,\
  \ certainly the most bizarre settings the comics have yet explored. Which was more\
  \ fun: writing Kaer Maga or writing the Boneyard?</p> \n      <p>Why would you make\
  \ me choose like that? I can definitely say that I am sad I didn't get to write\
  \ more of Kaer Maga proper, as we move on pretty quickly from that very unique and\
  \ interesting setting. I only really get to scratch the surface of a city varied\
  \ enough for a whole series, and I hope I get the chance to revisit in the future.\
  \ Until then, man, the Boneyard was a ton of fun to write!</p> \n      <p style=\"\
  font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">One of this issue's variant covers and\
  \ the comic's story itself feature Valeros and iconic inquisitor Imrijka engaged\
  \ in some, shall we say, \"adult activities.\" What's the story behind this pairing?</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Imrijka and Valeros have been a popular fan relationship since we first\
  \ introduce Imrijka in the <em>Advanced Player's Guide</em>, and they're one of\
  \ the few relationships between iconics anyone has really talked about beyond Kyra\
  \ and Merisiel. They're both fairly energetic and physical, but feel healthier being\
  \ uncommitted, and neither are the type to judge someone at first glance. Plus,\
  \ I honestly just think they make a cute couple. Or at least cute \"friends with\
  \ benefits,\" at any rate.</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>Thanks to Crystal\
  \ for taking the time to answer these pressing questions!</p> \n     <div class=\"\
