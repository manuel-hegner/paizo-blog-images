  \      <p><a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq034hx\"><em>Pathfinder Player\
  \ Core 2</em></a> released at Gen Con, and sanctioning has been posted on the <a\

  >Remaster Guidelines</a> take effect for all characters as well. Please be sure\
  \ to review them and leave any questions in the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/threads/rzs43wjw?Official-PFS2-Guide-to-Organized-Play\"\

  \ and figure out what problems we’ve discovered that need guidance from the OP team.</p>\n\

  \ quickly (though I wouldn’t blame you, it’s a lot of fun). Also on our upcoming\

  \ War of Immortals</em></a>.</p>\n      <br>\n      <h2>Starfinder Playtest</h2>\n\
  \      <p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Starfinder Playtest has begun! The <a\
  \ href=\"https://downloads.paizo.com/StarfinderPlaytest_TrackingSheet.pdf\">Starfinder\
  \ Playtest tracking sheet</a> is now available at <strong>starfinderplaytest.com</strong>,\
  \ ready for you to track your participation in the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/store/starfinder/society/s2Playtest\"\
  >two playtest scenarios</a> as well as the published softcover adventures. Let us\
  \ know what you think in the playtest surveys!</p>\n      <br>\n      <h2>GM Recognition</h2>\n\
  \      <p>As Gen Con is our biggest stage, we took the time to do quite a bit of\
  \ recognition of our volunteers!</p>\n      <h3>Order of the Wayfinder</h3>\n  \
  \    <p>In addition to the Campaign Service Coin, we also have one other award:\
  \ the Order of the Wayfinder. This award is given out only once per year, and it\
  \ recognizes a member of the community who has provided exceptional service. Typically,\
  \ we give this award to individuals who have taken on a particular project and knocked\
  \ it out of the park. Previously, this award has been awarded to the head of our\
  \ Additional Resources review team and our Regional Venture-Coordinator for the\
  \ Online region, among others.</p>\n      <p>This year’s recipient, awarded at Gen\
  \ Con, was <strong>Lucas Servideo</strong>. Lucas is a longtime volunteer with Paizo\
  \ Organized Play and currently serves as the Regional Venture-Coordinator for the\
  \ Northeast region. Over the past several years, Lucas has been dedicated to the\
  \ Pathfinder Academy program, which is our program for younger players and new Pathfinders.\
  \ Bringing new players into the program is crucial, and Lucas is a warm, welcoming,\
  \ and dedicated first point of contact for our youngest Pathfinders. He has been\
  \ a crucial advocate for this program, and I was thrilled to award him with the\
  \ Wayfinder this year while he was dressed as his contemplative character. That’\
  s just how we do things around here.</p>\n      <h3>Campaign Service Coins</h3>\n\
  \      <p>Additionally, I awarded two Campaign Service Coins at Gen Con! We award\
  \ these coins to members of the community who have gone above and beyond to provide\
  \ an exceptional program to the community at large. Campaign Coins are awarded based\
  \ on nominations; if you believe someone in your community is deserving of this\
  \ award (whether or not they are a Venture Officer), send an email to organizedplay@paizo.com\
  \ with their name and reasons.</p>\n      <p>Congratulations to:</p>\n      <p><strong>David\
  \ Malkiewicz</strong>, who now holds a campaign coin and OP ID #908</p>\n      <p><strong>Darrel\
  \ Curry</strong>, who now holds a campaign coin and OP ID #909</p>\n      <h3>GM\
  \ Ranks</h3>\n      <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in\
  \ any program involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the 5th milestone,\
  \ a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10\
  \ special scenarios as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains\
  \ (program dependent). A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th\
  \ milestone is 650 hours!</p>\n      <p><strong>5th Star (PFS1): </strong>Jason\
  \ Belter</p>\n      <p><strong>5th Glyph (PFS2): </strong>John Brinkman, David Malkiewicz,\
  \ Mykal Merrill</p>\n      <p>If you believe you’ve completed your 5th rank but\
  \ haven’t been announced yet, please email me at organizedplay@paizo.com.</p>\n\
  \      <p>That’s quite enough from me! I’m off to PaizoCon Europe to eat cheese\
  \ and chocolate—and probably do some gaming somewhere in there. Until next time:\
  \ Explore! Report! Cooperate! And enjoy the summer sunshine (or winter sunshine,\
  \ for our southern hemisphere friends)!</p>\n      <p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\
