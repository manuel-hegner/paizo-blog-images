  \ of <a href=\"/products/btpy9y9m?Pathfinder-Battles-Jungle-of-Despair\"><em>Jungle\
  \ of Despair</em></a>—which releases next week—I'm excited to announce the next\
  \ Pathfinder Battles miniatures set from our partners at WizKids.</p> \n    <p>Currently\
  \ scheduled for an October release, <a href=\"/products/btpya11f?Pathfinder-Battles-Kingmaker\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Battles: Kingmaker</em></a>, is the fifteenth set of prepainted\
  \ plastic miniatures in the popular Pathfinder Battles line. Featuring 44 randomized\
  \ figures in sizes ranging from Small to Large, and six pieces of dungeon dressing,\
  \ <em>Pathfinder Battles: Kingmaker</em> exemplifies the commitment to quality sculpts\
  \ and paint jobs, as well as variety and utility of figures, the line is known for.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>As always, customers who order a case of <em>Pathfinder Battles: Kingmaker</em>\
  \ boosters will also have the opportunity to purchase the set's <a href=\"/products/btpya12e?Pathfinder-Battles-Kingmaker-Earth-Water-Elementals\"\
  >case incentive</a>. This set's two-figure incentive features the earth and water\
  \ elemental lords, completing the Huge elemental series we began last year in <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy9u15?Pathfinder-Battles-Maze-of-Death-Case-Incentive\"><em>Maze\
  \ of Death</em></a> with the air and fire elemental lords.</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  \ iconic allies and villains from the Kingmaker Adventure Path, such as the troll\
  \ leader and Nyrissa, a Large uncommon and Medium rare figure, respectively.</p>\

  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>There are also a number of more generic tropes of the\
  \ genre we're releasing for the first time, like the bat swarm, werewolf, and oni\
  \ mage. These figures fill in some of the gaps from the <a href=\"/products/btpy8auu?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Bestiary\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</em></a>, which many fans have requested we represent\
  \ as thoroughly as possible in prepainted plastic. The bat swarm and werewolf are\
  \ both Medium figures, at the common and uncommon rarities, respectively, while\
  \ the oni mage is a Large uncommon figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ target=\"_blank\"><em>Pathfinder Kingmaker</em></a>, the first isometric, party-based\
  \ computer RPG set in the Pathfinder fantasy universe (now in Beta for Kickstarter\
  \ backers!), we also had the unique opportunity to provide miniatures of the many\
  \ new characters being introduced in the game by the game's developers at Owlcat\
  \ Games. These companions will join the player along their journey to conquer and\
  \ rule the Stolen Lands, and can now join players in their tabletop games as well.\
  \ Check out Regongar, half-orc magus, the first of these companions we're showing\
  \ off. A Medium rare figure, Regongar also makes a great PC or enemy NPC with the\
  \ lightning spell effect giving him unmatched gravitas on the battle mat.</p> \n\

  \ Deep Cuts unpainted plastic miniatures from WizKids. Until then, keep rolling\
