  \ \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">The inexorable approach of Pathfinder Society's\
  \ second edition campaign means the team's relentlessly discussing, finalizing,\
  \ and formalizing ever more campaign details, much as we <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo6sglh?Pathfinder-Society-Second-Edition-Preview\"\
  >shared in April with earned benefits</a>. This month we're not only presenting\
  \ four more preview topics, but there's also another blog happening later today\
  \ to introduce the first of two new factions. Let's get to it!</p> \n     <h2>Chronicle\
  \ Sheets</h2> \n     <p>With all of the changes we're making to the organized play\
  \ campaign, one of the most visually apparent differences is the redesign of our\
  \ Chronicle sheets. We've shared <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgba?Pathfinder-Society-2-Boons-and-Sheets\"\
  >a few samples of potential new Chronicle sheets in previous blogs</a>, collecting\
  \ lots of feedback from you in the process. Studying your comments alongside the\
  \ other updates and changes we've made in the organized play program; we've come\
  \ up with a close-to-final version of the Chronicle sheet for you to check out and\
  \ give us any final thoughts or feedback on before it gets locked in. With the new\
  \ Achievement Points system and other updates, we've adjusted the Chronicle sheet\
  \ to feature more room for tracking expenditures, adventure summaries, and other\
  \ useful tools. And if we're tracking those on a Chronicle sheet again, that means\
  \ the Inventory Tracking Sheet can be a thing of the past.</p> \n     <p>They say\
  \ that a picture is worth a thousand words, so at this point, I'll wrap up talking\
  \ and direct you to the sample of the new Chronicle sheet linked below. Please check\
  \ it out and let us know what you think!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n\

  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <h2>Rarity and Item Access</h2> \n     <p>As you likely\
  \ saw in the <em>Pathfinder Playtest Rulebook</em>, Pathfinder's second edition\
  \ includes both item levels and rarities. These two topics share the same themes—\
  namely getting cool gear in your PC's hands—so we're looking at them together.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>An item's level is a reliable indication of its power, its price, and\
  \ whether a character of a given level should typically have one handy, plus it\
  \ makes creating higher-level characters pretty handy (e.g., begin with this many\
  \ 3rd-level items, this many 4th, etc.). If you've played Starfinder, you already\
  \ have a good sense of what item levels look like and how they function. The main\
  \ difference is that Pathfinder focuses less on buying ever-better versions of your\
  \ preferred weapon and instead on applies power-boosting augmentations to it.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>When we launched Starfinder Society, we saw item levels as a natural\
  \ way to indicate when a PC could access and purchase a particular item. In that\
  \ campaign, PCs can buy items from the <em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em> up to their\
  \ level + 1, items from other sources up to their level + 0, and anything from a\
  \ Chronicle sheet up to their level + 2. In those reasonably rare circumstances\
  \ in which someone earns and keeps Infamy, each point of Infamy reduces the PC's\
  \ effective level by 1 for the purpose of buying gear (arms merchants tend not to\
  \ trust PC criminals with the latest plasma cannon). This model's worked out pretty\
  \ smoothly, especially in that it means any higher-level equipment on a Chronicle\
  \ sheet is relevant (a common complaint in Pathfinder Society's use of Fame for\
  \ equipment access). By giving broader access to the Core Rulebook's equipment,\
  \ we both indicated that gear was more common and thus easier to access, and we\
  \ were aiming to keep that book's contents as relevant as possible even as other\
  \ books began appearing on shelves.</p> \n     <p>We're implementing something very\
  \ similar in the new Pathfinder Society campaign, with Chronicle sheets granting\
  \ earlier level-access to gear and Infamy making it tougher to find top-tier equipment.\
  \ We're still tinkering with the numbers a little, particularly for the Pathfinder\
  \ Core Rulebook's contents compared to that of other books. After all, we have a\
  \ different tool for understanding how common different gear is: rarity.</p> \n\
  \     <p><strong>Rarity</strong> addresses two elements in the game: ubiquity and\
  \ complexity. For <strong>ubiquity</strong>, whether an option's common or uncommon\
  \ (or rare or unique) indicates how likely a PC is to find it at a store, in a treasure\
  \ hoard, or in an NPC's hands. Anything common is something that a PC's typically\
  \ able to find without much difficulty, wealth permitting. Uncommon options might\
  \ be fairly pervasive in a specific area or for a particular organization, but they're\
  \ limited enough that not everyone can get a hold of them. Rare options are very\
  \ limited and are unlikely to appear except as coveted treasure. As for <strong>complexity</strong>,\
  \ the rarity system also communicates the relative complexity or ramifications of\
  \ using an option, such as how <em>detect evil</em> can vastly simplify an investigation,\
  \ <em>teleport</em> can handwave the challenges of an overland journey, or <em>antimagic\
  \ field</em> causes everyone to recalculate how their equipment and bonuses work\
  \ suddenly.</p> \n     <p>In Pathfinder Society, expect to see nearly universal\
  \ access to common character options (ancestries, feats, archetypes, items, spells,\
  \ and the like). In fact, our hope for the Additional Resources page is to be pretty\
  \ minimalist, with the understanding that nearly any common option you find in a\
  \ book would be good to go in organized play. On the far end of the spectrum, don't\
  \ expect to see rare or unique options except on Chronicle sheets. And in the middle,\
  \ we have uncommon options. These are fertile ground for including on Chronicle\
  \ sheets, especially when an item's an excellent fit for a particular adventure.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>But there are many more uncommon options than we can reasonably and\
  \ tastefully fit on a Chronicle sheet, so does that just leave a bunch of fantastic\
  \ uncommon options \"stranded\"? Not quite. One of the significant ways you'll be\
  \ able to use your <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo6sglh?Pathfinder-Society-Second-Edition-Preview\"\
  >Achievement Points</a> is gaining access to uncommon options—including uncommon\
  \ ancestries, in effect functioning as the old \"race boons.\" Does that mean all\
  \ of the uncommon options printed in every book becomes accessible? No, there will\
  \ still be some uncommon options we hold back for gameplay and complexity reasons,\
  \ but we're aiming to allow access to a solid percentage of the uncommon published\
  \ material.</p> \n     <p>Speaking of Achievement Points (AcP), we heard your feedback\
  \ about possible other names and abbreviations, and we've been workshopping some\
  \ other possibilities to test out with our volunteers. More on this soon!</p> \n\
  \     <h2>Replay for Seasons 0–10</h2> \n     <p>Ah, but essential as rarity may\
  \ be, it's hardly captured the public discourse like replay—specifically, how replay\
  \ opportunities are going to work in the current PFS campaign once August hits and\
  \ we stop producing new scenarios for the first edition of the game. We've collected\
  \ a lot of feedback, data, and opinions from many of you on this topic, and we've\
  \ taken all of that, as well as considering what's best for the health and stability\
  \ of both campaigns, and come up with a framework that we think will allow both\
  \ PFS campaigns to be as strong as is feasible.</p> \n     <p>First, all of the\
  \ replay options that are currently available will continue to be so. This includes\
  \ GM star recharges existing convention boons that offer replay options and the\
  \ current stable of replayable (evergreen) adventures. We all agreed that it was\
  \ important not to take anything away from the first edition Pathfinder Society\
  \ campaign; we want to build on what everyone's familiar with, not replace the working\
  \ systems players and GMs already know.</p> \n     <p>Secondly, we'll be taking\
  \ a snapshot of all of the recorded organized play sessions on Paizo.com in mid-July.\
  \ It will be imperative to make sure all of your game sessions are recorded by this\
  \ point in time, as this snapshot will be set against an activity scale that will\
  \ determine the number of \"free\" replays that are applied to your account. Essentially,\
  \ the more regularly that you have played and GM'd, the more Pathfinder first edition\
  \ replays you will be granted. This will allow those who are nearing the end of\
  \ their playable material to have a similar gameplay \"lifespan\" to players who\
  \ have just recently joined the organized play campaign.</p> \n     <p>Finally,\
  \ you may recall from <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo6sglh?Pathfinder-Society-Second-Edition-Preview\"\
  >our April blog</a> that we will be introducing a type of digital currency called\
  \ \"Achievement Points\" for Pathfinder's second edition organized play campaign.\
  \ For the purposes of discussing replay, the main thing to note is that you will\
  \ earn Achievement Points every time you play a PFS second edition game, in roughly\
  \ the same amounts that you gain XP. There will be a variety of things you can redeem\
  \ these Achievement Points for, such as the uncommon items mentioned above, including\
  \ first edition replays. The more you play or GM for the new edition, the more potential\
  \ replay opportunities you'll accrue for the first edition campaign.</p> \n    \
  \ <h2>Tags</h2> \n     <p>If you've played Starfinder Society, you may already be\
  \ familiar with scenario tags. Tags are markers that appear both on a scenario's\
  \ product page and on its title page that gives key information about the scenario's\
  \ contents. We'll be using the following tags in Pathfinder Society.</p> \n    \
  \ <p><strong>Repeatable</strong>: Scenarios with this tag can be replayed an unlimited\
  \ number of times (but only once per character). GMs receive another Chronicle sheet\
  \ each time they run a scenario with this tag (but can apply credit only once to\
  \ a given character).</p> \n     <p><strong>Faction</strong>: Scenarios with this\
  \ tag list one or more associated factions. As an example, we'll use a couple of\
  \ made-up factions. \"Faction (Door Bashers)\" would indicate a scenario that is\
  \ of some importance to the Door Bashers faction—no doubt due to the large number\
  \ of very important doors that need kicking. Similarly, a scenario with the \"Faction\
  \ (Door Bashers, Monster Punchers)\" tag would indicate a scenario that would be\
  \ of interest to characters championing the Door Bashers or Monster Punchers faction.\
  \ This tag generally corresponds to scenarios with additional Reputation awards\
  \ for the associated factions.</p> \n     <p><strong>Exclusive</strong>: Scenarios\
  \ with this tag are meant to be run in a specific environment or by a particular\
  \ cadre of Pathfinder GMs. Common recipients of these sorts of scenarios include\
  \ distinguished volunteers who've run many sessions of Pathfinder Society, GMs running\
  \ the exclusive at a large convention, or a Paizo staff member. Scenarios with this\
  \ tag include specific rules on who is eligible to run it, where it may be run,\
  \ as well as any other considerations for eligibility of receiving credit.</p> \n\
  \     <p>We're leaving open the possibility of adding additional tags in the future.\
  \ For example, if we were to release a scenario-length pack of quest (as opposed\
  \ to individual quests), we would likely use a quest tag to mark that adventure.\
  \ We might also introduce additional tags to signify substantial rules elements,\
  \ much as Starfinder Society added the vehicle tag to scenarios that use the vehicle\
  \ rules.</p> \n     <p>Join us back here this afternoon for breaking news you don't\
  \ want to miss – the first faction announcement for Pathfinder Society (2nd edition).</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Next week we preview the May scenarios, just before heading to PaizoCon.\
  \ While there, we will host Question &amp; Answer panels on both the Pathfinder\
  \ and Starfinder Society, as well as join the Lone Shark developers for a discussion\
  \ of all things Pathfinder Adventure Card Game, including the Pathfinder Adventure\
  \ Card Society. For those unable to join us, we will summarize our announcements\
  \ in a blog the following Wednesday.</p> \n     <p>John Compton<br> <i>Organized\
