  \ Pathfinder Society program, as well as to continue tying up loose ends, <a href=\"\

  ><i>Deathâ€™s Heretic</i></a> have now been incorporated into the Pathfinder Society.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Because of the differences between reading a novel and playing a game,\
  \ there are specific rules needed for using sanctioned content from a Pathfinder\
  \ Tales novel during play and we'll be providing a Chronicle sheet for players to\
  \ use with their characters. You can download the Chronicle sheets on their respective\
  \ product pages.</p> \n   <p>Sanctioned novels you ask? How do you sanction a novel?\
  \ Because Pathfinder Tales novels are stories first, there is no easy way to sanction\
  \ items, spells, feats, or other special abilities whole cloth. Therefore, the Chronicle\
  \ sheets use the following rules.</p> \n   <ol>\n    <li>Only items, feats, boons,\
  \ or abilities found on the Chronicle sheet are legal for play.</li> \n    <li>Each\
  \ player must have a copy of the Chronicle sheet with his or her character at all\
  \ times.</li> \n    <li>In order for the Chronicle sheet to be considered legal\
  \ for play, the player must show to the GM a copy of the Pathfinder Tales novel,\
  \ either in printed or digital format.</li> \n    <li>A Chronicle sheet may be applied\
  \ to each character the player currently has or creates in the future.</li>\n  \
  \ </ol> \n   <p>GMs are advised to work with players to make the sanctioning of\
  \ Pathfinder Tales Chronicle sheets easy and fast. As long as the player has a copy\
  \ of the book, she should be able to use the Chronicle sheet just like any other.</p>\
