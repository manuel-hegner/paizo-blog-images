  >Aberny chuckled at the sight of the gnome squaring off with the half-elf, paintbrush\
  \ crossed with a short sword. The campfire cast the dueling partners into bronze-and-shadow\
  \ relief. Ralynn glowered down his sword, while Tali glared back up at him, both\
  \ as riled as if one had slandered the other's parentage.</span></p> \n     <p>\
  \ \"This is ridiculous,\" Ralynn said. \"You can't seriously believe your brush\
  \ is equal to my blade. They're leagues apart in use and value.\"</p> \n     <p>\
  \ Tali flourished her brush, spraying azure droplets about. \"So! You admit art\
  \ is superior to swordplay.\"</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb360\">\n      <a href=\"\

  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n      <br>Aberny never backs out of a wager.\n     </div> \n\
  \     <p> Ralynn's fair skin reddened up to the tips of his ears. \"Not what I meant,\
  \ and you know it.\" He twitched his blade, notching the wooden shaft of her brush.</p>\
  \ \n     <p> Tali's emerald eyes widened even further, and another flick struck\
  \ drops of paint across Ralynn's pants. This drew an outraged splutter from the\
  \ fighter, whose grip tightened on his sword hilt.</p> \n     <p> Knowing Ralynn's\
  \ temper, Aberny stood from his cushioned stool, wide hands splayed to separate\
  \ the two before their verbal sparring came to true blows. </p> \n     <p> \"Friends,\
  \ might we dispense with the arguing? After all, we didn't come out to hunt one\
  \ another. And the simple matter is, you're both wrong.\"</p> \n     <p> The two\
  \ turned to him, and he grinned, knowing the firelight would enhance his broad smile\
  \ and dark, plump cheeks. His jovial demeanor often allowed him to turn even the\
  \ harshest haggling to his advantage, and he hoped the image he'd cultivated through\
  \ years caravanning along the Dry Way would work just as well with his companions.\
  \ </p> \n     <p> Nothing threatening to see here. Just a common human merchant,\
  \ arrayed in a colorful robe and adorned with silly trinkets. Don't mind him making\
  \ off with your coin.</p> \n     <p> At last, Tali lowered her brush. \"Hm? Wrong?\
  \ What do you mean?\"</p> \n     <p> Aberny gestured to the small dining array his\
  \ servants had set up. \"Let's consider matters with fuller bellies, shall we?\"\
  </p> \n     <p> After another smoldering glare at each other, the two hunting partners\
  \ went to fallen logs on opposite sides of the campfire. Ralynn began tending to\
  \ one of half a dozen blades he carried, while Tali adjusted her violet and silver-trimmed\
  \ dress and plunked down before the canvas she'd been painting on earlier. Aberny\
  \ gave silent thanks that Ralynn couldn't see her work from his angle, as she began\
  \ to paint his likeness in a most unflattering manner. </p> \n     <p> Aberny's\
  \ servants tended to cuts of venison sizzling on the fire, a contribution from Ralynn,\
  \ who'd downed a deer on their journey out from Whistledown that morning. A pair\
  \ of Aberny's caravan guards stood on the edge of the firelight, hands resting on\
  \ sword pommels, alert to any danger the night held—though Ralynn had scouted the\
  \ area and assured them no sign of the chimera existed anywhere near. </p> \n  \
  \   <p> They'd set a first camp in a bushy grove among the hilly grasslands between\
  \ Whistledown and Sanos Forest; haunting melodies could still be faintly heard,\
  \ produced by the popular enchanted wooden carvings that gave the distant town its\
  \ name. The eerie keening was broken up by the occasional whicker of their horses,\
  \ which had been tied up nearby for the evening.</p> \n     <p> \"You're both wrong,\"\
  \ Aberny said, \"because art and battle submit to a greater power.\"</p> \n    \
  \ <p> Ralynn paused in worked a grindstone along an edge. \"Like what?\"</p> \n\
  \     <p> \"Commerce. Profit.\"</p> \n     <p> Tali let out a tinkling laugh. \"\
  Oh! Of course the trader would think so.\"</p> \n     <p> Aberny accepted the mocking\
  \ with another smile. \"Without merchants like myself toiling along the Dry Way,\
  \ turning coin to goods and back again, neither of you would even have the supplies\
  \ or equipment necessary to pursue your passions. Profiteers are the lifeblood of\
  \ civilization.\"</p> \n     <p> He accepted a slosh of wine from a skin, and a\
  \ servant handed him a prepared plate while the other began slicing off cuts for\
  \ his companions. </p> \n     <p> Tali hopped up from the canvas and scampered over\
  \ to the fire, where she began to portion out the proffered meal for herself. \"\
  But! Think. Without artists, merchants have nothing to sell. Fighters nothing worth\
  \ crossing swords. Commerce paves the roads through a city, and fighters build the\
  \ walls, but art is...\" She shut her wide eyes briefly. \"Art is the towering pinnacle\
  \ that defines us.\"</p> \n     <p> Ralynn chuckled. \"Pinnacle, huh? Take all day\
  \ to come up with that?\"</p> \n     <p> Aberny raised an eyebrow as Tali piled\
  \ meat onto her plate. By the time she finished, she staggered under a mound of\
  \ venison that looked almost twice her weight. How exactly did the gnome intend\
  \ to devour such a vast repast? </p> \n     <p> \"Some say fighting is an art form\
  \ in itself,\" he suggested.</p> \n     <p> Tali crinkled her nose. \"Fighting?\
  \ Art? If you want bloodshed and death, fine, but I don't see the beauty in it yet.\"\
  </p> \n     <p> Ralynn speared a bite of meat and pointed it at her. \"Sounds like\
  \ we got ourselves a blind painter.\"</p> \n     <p> \"Yet! I said I don't see it\
  \ <i>yet</i>. I'm not saying it's not there. That's why I cast my lot in on this\
  \ hunt. To bring greater insight to my craft.\"</p> \n     <p> \"Yeah?\" Ralynn\
  \ smirked. \"Even if it costs you a thousand gold?\"</p> \n     <p> Tali bowed her\
  \ head, the fire casting half her face in shadow. \"I...I'd sacrifice anything for\
  \ the sake of true art. It can't be faked. It must be lived. But you're only here\
  \ because—\"</p> \n     <p> \"Because I was drunk as slime at the bottom of a wine\
  \ barrel when you two decided to make a contest of this bounty. I've made worse\
  \ bets, but I don't back out on a wager.\" Aberny locked eyes with each of them\
  \ in turn over the flames. \"Ever. Besides, I stand the best chance of winning.\
  \ Think your gnome trickery will help you beat the beast?\"</p> \n     <p> Tali\
  \ perked up. \"Master Aberny! If you'd read the contract aloud?\" She settled back\
  \ to work on her canvas.</p> \n     <p> Aberny reached into the pocket where he'd\
  \ secured the unusual contract they'd drawn up the previous night, when deep in\
  \ drink back in Whistledown's popular inn, the Azure Cup. Over the years, the three\
  \ of them had made a habit of meeting there during his stopovers in town. Odd companions,\
  \ but familiar faces who helped ground him. Still, he never let personal attachments,\
  \ however fond, get in the way of business.</p> \n     <p> He unrolled the parchment,\
  \ revealing their three signatures at the bottom, and read the main statement.</p>\
  \ \n     <p> \"‘With the evidence of a chimera prowling the nearby countryside—\
  reportedly responsible for at least a dozen deaths of travelers and homesteaders\
  \ alike—a bounty of one thousand gold has been placed on the monster's head. We,\
  \ the undersigned, do swear to partake in a hunt of the unnatural beast, employing\
  \ our individual skills and resources toward the ending of its foul appetites. Furthermore,\
  \ the first of our party to kill or capture the beast will receive not only the\
  \ publicly posted reward, but an additional thousand gold pieces from each of the\
  \ other two challengers.'\"</p> \n     <p> The artist flourished her brush. \"Aha!\
  \ Hear that? Kill <i>or</i> capture.\" She popped to her feet and swept a bow. \"\
  And I will capture the chimera.\"</p> \n     <p> Ralynn snorted, an indelicate act\
  \ that marred his fine features. \"Sure. Gonna grab its tail for a moment before\
  \ it gobbles you?\" </p> \n     <p> Tali turned her canvas around, revealing Ralynn's\
  \ face, painted with his tongue stuck out, eyes crossed, and cheeks puffed. \"There.\
  \ My first victim. I've captured you. You're trapped in my art forever.\"</p> \n\
  \     <p> Aberny couldn't quite contain a chortle.</p> \n     <p> Ralynn's ears\
  \ reddened again. \"Oh?\" Before anyone could move, he dashed over and slashed through\
  \ the sketch, leaving Tali holding ragged fabric on either side of her head. </p>\
  \ \n     <p> Her face twisted in fury and she flung a hand out. A burst of dazzling\
  \ lights exploded before Ralynn's face, forcing him to squint and turn aside. </p>\
  \ \n     <p> \"Brute!\" She cast the scraps away and leapt up, slashing her paintbrush\
  \ across Ralynn's chest, leaving a cerulean streak.</p> \n     <p> Ralynn snarled\
  \ and Tali yelped as the half-elf grabbed the front of her dress and jerked her\
  \ up inches from his scowl, sword clenched in a white-knuckled fist.</p> \n    \
  \ <p> Aberny lurched up, scattering wine and food. \"Ralynn! Let her go.\" </p>\
  \ \n     <p> The fighter hesitated until the guards shifted, hands on sword pommels.\
  \ As soon as her feet touched the earth, Tali jumped back out of reach. She brushed\
  \ herself off and fixed her viridian hair back into its sweeping coif. Aberny held\
  \ out a silk handkerchief so the half-elf could clean off his face. Ralynn snatched\
  \ it away, muttering thanks.</p> \n     <p> \"As host of this hunt,\" Aberny said,\
  \ \"I won't abide violence towards one another.\" He fixed a serious look on Tali.\
  \ \"The same for you, little mistress, even in jest.\"</p> \n     <p> Tali bunched\
  \ her fists. \"Hmph. I take my leave of you barbarians to dine in peace.\" She hefted\
  \ her plate, still mounded with meat, snagged a wineskin, and staggered off into\
  \ the brush surrounding the campsite.</p> \n     <p> Ralynn finished wiping off\
  \ the paint and offered the silk back, but Aberny waved it away. The half-elf frowned\
  \ in the direction Tali had gone. </p> \n     <p> \"She can't just sketch the beast\
  \ to win.\"</p> \n     <p> \"She's technically correct, though,\" Aberny said with\
  \ a sigh. \"Same as my using hired guards to slay the beast for me, since they're\
  \ personal resources.\"</p> \n     <p> \"At least they could give me a real challenge—\
  though I doubt it. She's missing the whole point of a hunt.\"</p> \n     <p> \"\
  Don't worry. Art is subjective. Even if she does manage to paint the monster, we'll\
  \ argue the work doesn't truly capture its essence and so falls short of the prize.\"\
  </p> \n     <p> Ralynn grinned. \"You've thought this through.\"</p> \n     <p>\
  \ \"I always do.\"</p> \n     <p> Tali returned a bit later, plate and wineskin\
  \ empty, while her stomach strained at the confines of her dress. With a few unladylike\
  \ burps, she excused herself to bed and crawled into her gnome-sized tent. Minutes\
  \ later, high-pitched snoring mingled with the far-off music of her hometown. </p>\
  \ \n     <p> Claiming a preference for sleeping beneath the sky, Ralynn laid a simple\
  \ bedroll beside the fire. He stretched out on this, still dressed in his fighting\
  \ leathers and with multiple blades strapped to him. </p> \n     <p> Aberny then\
  \ retired to his own tent, almost a small home in itself with a portable bed, desk,\
  \ and chest of select personal items. When one spent countless weeks traveling between\
  \ anything resembling civilization, investing in personal comforts paid dividends\
  \ in return. </p> \n     <p> He spent another hour going through a ledger of contacts\
  \ back in Whistledown, evaluating how he might invest the reward he fully intended\
  \ to collect for the chimera's demise. Not that he believed Ralynn or Tali immediately\
  \ possessed a thousand gold. But their debts would add to the many he'd accrued\
  \ from others over the years and he'd inevitably find a way to translate them into\
  \ profits. After all, why have friends if they didn't add value to one's life?</p>\
  \ \n     <p> As he pondered snuffing the lamp for sleep, a scream tore the night's\
  \ peace in two. Shouts rang out from the guards, followed by a defiant cry from\
  \ Ralynn.</p> \n     <p> Aberny raced out of the tent just as the body of one of\
  \ his servants flopped to the ground before him—missing a head.</p> \n     <p align=\"\
