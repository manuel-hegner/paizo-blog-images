  artist: "the lower lip. Suddenly it reared its head until the black-furred creature\
    \ was drawn completely out of the water, and he saw that the latter was a web-footed\
    \ animal about as large as a full-grown terrestrial lion, with short legs and\
    \ a leathery, paddle-shaped tail which was edged with sharp spines. With the exception\
    \ of the tail and claws, the body was covered with fur. The scaly monster shook\
    \ its head, dislodging its smaller enemy and losing most of its lower lip in the\
    \ process. Then, as the furry creature splashed into the water, it arched its\
    \ neck and struck. Thorne expected to see the smaller creature instantly slain.\
    \ Instead he saw a startling demonstration of its superior cunning and quickness.\
    \ With a speed his eye could scarcely follow, it avoided the lunge of that terrible\
    \ head, and turning, seized the slender, stalklike neck of its adversary in its\
    \ own relatively large jaws. One powerful crunch, and the battle was over. The\
    \ severed head sank"
