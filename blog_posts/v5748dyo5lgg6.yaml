  description\">As someone who spends most of his time living in the Pathfinder campaign\
  \ setting, I think one of the coolest things about the Pathfinder Tales novels is\
  \ their ability to give players and GMs a deeper understanding of Golarion. As GMs,\
  \ we may have read the sourcebook on a region, but the novels give us a chance to\
  \ see that place through the eyes of the people who live there, to get the sights\
  \ and smells in a more immediate and visceral fashion. As players, the novels are\
  \ even more important, as they represent a chance to get that feel for an area without\
  \ reading an adventure or sourcebook full of spoilers. That's one of the reasons\
  \ we included the Pathfinder's Journal way back in Pathfinder Adventure Path #1—\
  so that GMs could hand those pages to their players and say, \"Here's a story about\
  \ the place you're adventuring in.\" Now that we have the novels, I wouldn't think\
  \ of starting a campaign in, say, Nidal without pointing my players toward Liane\
  \ Merciel's <a href=\"/products/btpy8sa9\"><i>Nightglass</i></a> as inspirational\
  \ reading.</span></p> \n    <p>Which brings us to the newest Pathfinder Tales novel,\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy98i2\"><i>Reign of Stars</i></a>. While it doesn't follow\
  \ the storyline of <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/ironGods\">Iron Gods</a>—\
  no spoilers, remember?—this book is very much a prequel to that AP. Tim Pratt first\
  \ introduced us to his ex-Technic League apprentice Alaeron back in <a href=\"/products/btpy8rkv\"\
  ><i>City of the Fallen Sky</i></a>, but this time, he's gone whole-hog and taken\
  \ us on a tour of Numeria, complete with first-hand insights into the insidious\
  \ dealings of the Technic League and the Black Sovereign. What's more, when developing\
  \ both this novel and the Iron Gods Adventure Path, James Jacobs, Mark Moreland,\
  \ Tim Pratt, and I all worked closely together to make sure that not only did the\
  \ flavor of the various books match, but that characters and critters from the novel\
  \ showed up in the Adventure Path and the Numeria sourcebook, and vice versa.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>In short, I think we've created the perfect fiction companion to <a href=\"\
  /pathfinder/adventurePath/ironGods\">Iron Gods</a>. So whether you're looking for\
  \ something to read between sessions of the AP, or simply itching for robots and\
  \ techno-rays from beyond the stars, consider giving <a href=\"/products/btpy98i2\"\
  ><i>Reign of Stars</i></a> a shot! <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lgft\">You can\
  \ read the first chapter for free here</a>. </p>\n    <p>Also, since we weren't\
  \ able to run it last week, here's an awesome new illustration of the absentminded\
  \ alchemist Alaeron himself, courtesy of Roberto Pitturru!</p> \n    <div class=\"\
