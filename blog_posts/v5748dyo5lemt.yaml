  >Skull &amp; Shackles</a> Pathfinder Battles prepainted fantasy miniatures set contains\
  \ scoundrels and scallywags from the water's surface, but some of my favorite figures\
  \ in the set actually live <i>below</i> the waves. One of the reasons we wanted\
  \ to create this set in the first place was to finally get some aquatic creatures\
  \ into the world of prepainted plastics, and WizKids has done a great job bringing\
  \ the briny deep to life before our eyes.</span></p> \n     <p>Time is very precious\
  \ on what looks to be a crazy busy Friday (I snuck out of a meeting just to write\
  \ this, in fact!), so I'm going to keep today's preview short, sweet, and to the\
  \ point.</p> \n     <p>Today we're going to talk about fish. It's shark week!</p>\
  \ \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130405-Shark.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130405-Shark_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Up first we have, well, a Shark. This guy is Large\
  \ (though not as large as another shark we'll show off in future weeks). He's mounted\
  \ on a clear peg so he looks like he's swimming right for you when his figure is\
  \ placed on the battle grid. You can't tell from the photo, but some of the detail\
  \ inside this creature's mouth is really remarkable. The Shark is an uncommon figure.</p>\
  \ \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130405-WeresharkPirate.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130405-WeresharkPirate_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>That was a cool shark, man. And here's\
  \ a cool sharkman. The Wereshark Pirate is a Medium common figure, suitable for\
  \ building an entire wereshark crew.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n  \
  \    <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130405-Riptooth.jpg\"><img src=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130405-Riptooth_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>A crew of wereshark pirates needs a wereshark captain. Here\
  \ we have Captain Riptooth, as nasty a pirate lord as you're likely to serve under\
  \ in the Shackles Isles. Beware! Captain Riptooth has quite a temper, and if you\
  \ cross him, he's likely to bite your head off! This fine fellow is a Large figure\
  \ at the rare rarity.</p> \n     <p>The set also includes an uncommon Hammerhead\
  \ Shark that had to go back to the sculptors for some minor cosmetic surgery and\
  \ seems to have escaped photography in the meantime. We'll get an image up of him\
  \ as soon as we can capture one ourselves.</p> \n     <p>Don't forget to preorder\
  \ your <a href=\"/products/btpy8xg6\">Skull &amp; Shackles</a> minis today to make\
  \ sure you don't miss out on any of these exciting figures!</p> \n     <p>And that's\
  \ it for the week. It is now officially safe to go back in the water!</p> \n   \
