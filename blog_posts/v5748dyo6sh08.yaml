  \  </div> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">We can learn much\
  \ from the wisdom of the divine, but we can learn as much from their actions. The\
  \ truly faithful understand that not even the gods themselves are infallible, and\
  \ that words and promises do not always suffice. Those among us who see no fault\
  \ in the gods are worse than zealots, worse than puppets. They taint the very idea\
  \ of faith with their blind devotion. When a god makes a mistake, the results can\
  \ be disastrous if their faithful do not understand the error. If they take that\
  \ error as gospel, they are doomed to repeat the error and compound upon it again\
  \ and again. And in so doing make the initial misstep into something more. In the\
  \ worst of cases, these repeated mistakes can transcend to become the new order,\
  \ and not even the gods themselves can turn them back.</p> \n     <p>Iomedae knows\
  \ this well, for she was, not so long ago, among those who worshiped the gods herself.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Before her Ascension, Iomedae worshiped Arazni, the herald of the god\
  \ of humanity, Aroden. When Arazni was defeated during the Shining Crusade, Iomedae\
  \ turned her faith to Aroden. That Iomedae herself chose the path of a paladin was\
  \ an indication of the strength of her convictions, for Arazni did not particularly\
  \ embody the strictures of law, nor did Aroden particularly promote acts of goodness.\
  \ But Iomedae saw the devotion to tradition and honor in Arazni’s deeds and could\
  \ sense the underlying kindness and generosity in Aroden’s acts even if he didn’\
  t notice them himself.</p> \n     <p>Even after she ascended to divinity herself,\
  \ she continued to serve as Aroden’s new herald, and when the god of humanity perished\
  \ unexpectedly at the dawning of the Age of Lost Omens, Iomedae did not lose hope.\
  \ In the decades to follow, Iomedae’s faith grew and she inherited Aroden’s mantle.\
  \ And as her church grew, she spread her wisdom to those who would listen. She told\
  \ her followers to avoid her faults. To watch and judge themselves when she would\
  \ misstep, and to not take her errors as gospel. For even before Iomedae’s apotheosis,\
  \ she had noted imperfections in the gods she venerated, and as a goddess herself\
  \ she vowed to never encourage the same unwavering zeal. And as such, she commanded\
  \ that those who would worship her learn not solely from her words, but from her\
  \ actions.</p> \n     <p>First came her memorable clash with legendary Nakorshor’\
  mond, a gluttonous monstrosity spawned and abandoned by Lamashtu. The glutton consumed\
  \ members of her adventuring group, and Iomedae had to cut her companions free from\
  \ otherwise eternal slumber from the fiend’s supernatural gullets.</p> \n     <p>Next\
  \ was her defeat of the Pallid Sisters, a coven of Garundi witches who had been\
  \ terrorizing the city of Senghor. Here, Iomedae found triumph without ever drawing\
  \ her blade, achieving victory through the clever use of wordplay and diplomacy\
  \ alone.</p> \n     <p>The last of these initial acts performed before the Shining\
  \ Crusade was the defeat of Segruchen the Iron Gargoyle, who had proclaimed himself\
  \ the King of the Barrowood. Iomedae’s griffon-mounted battle saw the so-called\
  \ King metaphorically dethroned in mid-air.</p> \n     <p>It wasn’t long after the\
  \ Iron Gargoyle’s fall that the Shining Crusade began, and Iomedae was at the forefront\
  \ of the battle from the start. During the Second Battle of Encarthan, Iomedae’\
  s legacy grew as she took command of a regiment of mortally wounded knights and\
  \ held back a wave of wraiths long enough for reinforcements to arrive at dawn.</p>\

  \ Williams</p> \n     </div> \n     <p>Erum-Hel, the Lord of the Mohrgs, was her\
  \ next great triumph during the crusade—Iomedae defeated him during the Battle of\
  \ Three Sorrows. She wasn’t able to slay the powerful undead monster, but sent him\
  \ whimpering back into the Darklands nonetheless, and in so doing struck a crippling\
  \ blow against one of the Whispering Tyrant’s most notorious and feared generals.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Soon thereafter, the Whispering Tyrant struck back against Iomedae and\
  \ shattered her magical sword. Yet Iomedae didn’t let this deter her, and she simply\
  \ rebuilt it and continued the fight, for she knew that it was not her sword that\
  \ gave her the power to stand against evil—it was only a tool in that pursuit.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>A month after the Shining Crusade came to an end, Iomedae visited Absalom\
  \ with several other veterans of the war. Her visit to the temple of Aroden drew\
  \ more adoration for her own acts than for Aroden herself, but it was a month after\
  \ she left that another miracle took place when her image appeared at the same shrine—\
  an image that healed the needy and spurned the wicked… including one false priest\
  \ of Aroden who had secretly conspired with the cult of Asmodeus to convert those\
  \ of faltering faith. </p> \n     <p>Although the Shining Crusade had ended, many\
  \ of those who had fought for Tar-Baphon remained behind. Since the war was over,\
  \ Iomedae sought to redeem those who had lingered. Her greatest work during these\
  \ days was the redemption of the graveknight known only as the Black Prince. With\
  \ her forgiveness, he was able to repent for his evil, bringing an end to his undead\
  \ state and allowing his soul to pass on for judgement.</p> \n     <p>Elsewhere\
  \ in Ustalav, Iomedae heard of nine forlorn knights who had fallen from favor among\
  \ the church during the crusade, only to go missing soon after their excommunication.\
  \ She sought them out and freed them from the vampire-mage Basilov, using nine drops\
  \ of her own blood as payment in ransom. She was forced to slay the vampire soon\
  \ thereafter, but with the knights’ aid, she also secured their return to the church.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Iomedae’s rule over the city of Kantaria began soon thereafter, but\
  \ only lasted for a year and a day, but she never intended to rule for long—just\
  \ long enough to protect the city from sinister shapechangers so that a legitimate\
  \ ruler could take the role.</p> \n     <p>Finally came her eleventh act—an act\
  \ that would end her time as a human and begin her life as a goddess. Iomedae cast\
  \ her cloak down over the pit surrounding the Starstone Cathedral, transforming\
  \ the garment into a bridge upon which she could cross the chasm and enter the edifice\
  \ to take the Test of the Starstone.</p> \n     <p>Today, the faithful refer to\
  \ these eleven deeds as the Acts of Iomedae. Iomedae has made it clear that the\
  \ lessons, not the specifics, are important, and to her faith’s credit the vast\
  \ majority understand this. What tends to get lost in the excitement of worship\
  \ and admiration, though, is the fact that Iomedae didn’t set out at the start of\
  \ her acts to perform eleven heroic accomplishments. They were, in truth, attempts\
  \ by Iomedae to learn from the failings of those she respected, be they family or\
  \ friend or even one of the gods.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p style=\"font-weight:\

  \ Director for Pathfinder. While he was there at the beginning of Golarion’s creation,\
  \ many of the deities worshiped by that world’s heroes and villains had already\
  \ existed for decades before. Goddesses and gods like Desna and Rovagug, Sarenrae\
  \ and Abadar, Achaekek and Zon-Kuthon first established their faithful among PCs\
  \ and NPCs alike in James’ home campaign in the late 80s and early 90s. Sharing\
  \ them with the world as deities of the Pathfinder setting, seeing players and creators\
  \ come to love and hate them (and in some cases cosplay as them), has been a career\
  \ highlight.</p> \n    <p style=\"font-weight: bold; line-height: 14px\">About the\
  \ Windsong Testaments</p> \n    <p>On the northern reaches of Varisia’s Lost Coast\
  \ stands Windsong Abbey, a forum for interfaith discussion tended by priests of\
  \ nearly twenty faiths and led by a legacy of Masked Abbesses. At the dawn of the\
  \ Age of Lost Omens, Windsong Abbey suffered as its faithful fought and fled, but\
  \ today it has begun to recover. A new Masked Abbess guides a new flock within,\
  \ and the <i>Windsong Testaments</i>—parables about the gods themselves—are once\
  \ again being recorded within the abbey’s walls. Some of these Testaments are presented\
  \ here as Golarion’s myths and fables. Some parts may be true. Other parts are certainly\
  \ false. Which ones are which is left to the faithful to decide.</p> \n   </div>\
