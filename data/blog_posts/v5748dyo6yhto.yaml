  \    </div>\n     <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\">In the long, long\
  \ ago, we announced changes to our errata process. In the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6si7o?Changes-to-the-Way-We-Make-Changes\"\
  >Changes to the Way We Make Changes</a> blog, we announced we would be issuing errata\
  \ twice per year, once in spring and once in fall. And we fully intended to do so!</p>\n\
  \      <p>Then the Remaster happened instead.</p>\n      <p>That workload was fast\
  \ and furious, and didn’t really leave time for other tasks like finding errata,\
  \ vetting the changes, and producing the public pages for them. Even after the books,\
  \ we were catching up with projects that had their schedules thrown into disarray,\
  \ and could release some Remaster compatibility errata only when the first of the\
  \ core books came out, over a year ago.</p>\n      <p>This blog marks us returning\
  \ to the intended schedule of two updates per year.</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \      <h2>Today’s Updates</h2>\n      <p>The new errata and clarifications are\
  \ <a href=\"https://paizo.com/pathfinder/faq\">up now on the FAQ page</a>, identified\
  \ with “Fall 2024” and the printing of the book they apply to. For example, “Player\
  \ Core Errata (Fall 2024, 1st Printing).” This set includes a pretty extensive set\
  \ of updates to make the initial Remaster books as accurate as possible. Future\
  \ sets of updates likely won’t be this lengthy. Also, because we previously put\
  \ out errata when a book was being reprinted, we typically had the final wording\
  \ on hand. In this new system, the challenges of text layout make it possible that\
  \ some of these updates might not match the exact final text when we reprint a book.\
  \ We could have to revise them later, keeping the same mechanical changes but adjusting\
  \ the wording a bit.</p>\n      <p>So what books are we covering?</p>\n      <p><em><b>Pathfinder\
  \ Player Core</b></em> has been out long enough for people to have found a lot of\
  \ minor errors, which make up the bulk of these updates. We covered some fixes that\
  \ veteran players familiar with the legacy books could likely figure out, but that\
  \ new players would lack the context for, such as stray mentions of “ability modifiers.”\
  \ Several feats got improvements to be more appealing for the characters they’re\
  \ meant for.</p>\n      <p>One of the notable changes you’ll see is an update to\
  \ the <em>sure strike</em> spell. The spell could be very strong, with the reroll\
  \ effectively making a much larger bonus than most abilities can grant. This benefit\
  \ was usually in control at low levels when characters had few spell slots, but\
  \ it could become disruptive and repetitive at higher levels on characters built\
  \ to gain a huge number of copies of the spell and use it constantly. We’ve added\
  \ temporary immunity to the spell, with the intent that it can still be very strong\
  \ to create intense moments, but that there’s little incentive to use more than\
  \ a handful of spell slots on it.</p>\n      <p><em><b>Pathfinder GM Core</b></em>\
  \ had some minor changes, mostly to cover side effects of the Remaster process and\
  \ the introduction of <em>reinforcing</em> runes being missed in a couple places.</p>\n\
  \      <p><em><b>Pathfinder Monster Core</b></em> had a variety of small changes.\
  \ The one that affects the most creatures is fixing the scaling on the <em>demonic\
  \ pact</em> and <em>diabolic pact</em> rituals.</p>\n      <p><em><b>Pathfinder\
  \ Player Core 2</b></em> saw a few changes, including changing the incorrect action\
  \ symbol on You’re Next to a reaction, giving the champion multiclass dedication\
  \ the champion’s aura ability, and fixing the damage on <em>live wire</em>.</p>\n\
  \      <p><em><b>Pathfinder Secrets of Magic</b></em> already received updates for\
  \ Remaster compatibility, but we’ve added some more updates. The main one is to\
  \ allow the magus to use spells that don’t require spell attacks. This made part\
  \ of the Expanded Spellstrike feat obsolete, but that feat can still be taken by\
  \ players who want to affect areas. Studious spells were missed in the previous\
  \ pass, and are now updated.</p>\n      <p>Other changes to <em>Secrets of Magic</em>\
  \ include several fixes to individual rules elements and repeating the elemental\
  \ themed changes and expansions that were detailed in <em>Pathfinder Rage of Elements</em>,\
  \ making them easier to find for people who don’t have that book.</p>\n      <p>In\
  \ addition, we’ve put out our lost album! That’s to say, the long-absent <em>Secrets\
  \ of Magic</em> 1st printing to 2nd printing errata is now on the FAQ page as well.</p>\n\
  \      <p>For <em><b>Pathfinder Howl of the Wild</b></em>, we’ve updated a few levels\
  \ and prices for some of the beast armaments so they are more in line with their\
  \ runes. We’ve made a few targeted changes as well—gone are the days of the minotaur\
  \ rogue also scaring all their teammates with Alarming Disappearance, which no longer\
  \ affects allies who have spent significant time with you.</p>\n      <p>For <em><b>Pathfinder\
  \ Lost Omens Tian Xia Character Guide</b></em>, a few pieces of missing information\
  \ were added, namely the Speed entries for the sarangay and yaksha ancestries, which\
  \ are both 25 feet.</p>\n      <p><em><b>Pathfinder War of Immortals</b></em> got\
  \ the few changes that were previewed in the <a href=\"https://downloads.paizo.com/PZO12006AlternateMythicRules.pdf\"\
  >Alternate Mythic Rules</a> document added to the FAQ page.</p>\n      <p>We hope\
  \ these changes will make your games play more smoothly and clear up a few points\
  \ of confusion! We’ll be keeping an eye out for other potential errata that come\
  \ up between now and spring.</p>\n      <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight:\
