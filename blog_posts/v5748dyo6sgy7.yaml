  \ internally to bring you more interactive showcases and updates on what's coming\
  \ up in the world of Paizo. Along with our partners sharing their incredible stories\
  \ with all of you. One of the initiatives I've wanted to take is to inform you of\
  \ what is going on. So every week I'd like to present to you with a schedule for\
  \ next week every Friday. So you know what's happening during that week for Paizo!</p>\
