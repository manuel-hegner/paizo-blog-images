  \  </div> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Today, we are pleased\
  \ to reveal the Pathfinder Second Edition Remaster Project, four new hardcover rulebooks\
  \ that offer a fresh entry point to the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/pathfinder\"\
  >Pathfinder Second Edition roleplaying game</a>! The first two books, <em><a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/products/btq02ej2?Pathfinder-Player-Core\">Pathfinder Player Core</a></em>\
  \ and <em><a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02ej3?Pathfinder-GM-Core\">Pathfinder\
  \ GM Core</a></em>, release this November, with <em><a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02ej4?Pathfinder-Monster-Core\"\
  >Pathfinder Monster Core</a></em> (March 2024) and <em><a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02ej5?Pathfinder-Player-Core-2\"\
  >Pathfinder Player Core 2</a></em> (July 2024) completing the remastered presentation\
  \ of Pathfinder’s core rules. The new rulebooks are compatible with existing Pathfinder\
  \ Second Edition products, incorporating comprehensive errata and rules updates\
  \ as well as some of the best additions from later books into new, easy-to-access\
  \ volumes with streamlined presentations inspired by years of player feedback.</p>\

  \     </div> \n     <br> \n     <p>This year saw a huge explosion of new Pathfinder\
  \ players. Remastered books like <em>Pathfinder Player Core</em> and <em>Pathfinder\
  \ GM Core</em> improve upon the presentation of our popular Pathfinder Second Edition\
  \ rules, remixing four years of updates and refinements to make the game easier\
  \ to learn and more fun to play.</p> \n     <br> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ Player Core Cover Mock\"></a>\n      <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\"> </p>\n   \
  \  </div> \n     <br> \n     <p>In time, the <em>Pathfinder Player Core</em>, <em>Pathfinder\
  \ GM Core</em>, <em>Pathfinder Monster Core</em>, and <em>Pathfinder Player Core\
  \ 2</em> will replace the <em><a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01zp3?Pathfinder-Core-Rulebook\"\
  >Pathfinder Core Rulebook</a></em>, <em><a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq022c1?Pathfinder-Gamemastery-Guide\"\
  >Gamemastery Guide</a></em>, <em><a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01zp4?Pathfinder-Bestiary\"\
  >Bestiary</a></em>, and <em><a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq023ih?Pathfinder-Advanced-Players-Guide\"\
  >Advanced Player’s Guide</a></em>, which Paizo will not reprint once their current\
  \ print runs expire. Existing Pathfinder players should be assured that the core\
  \ rules system remains the same, and the overwhelming majority of the rules themselves\
  \ will not change. Your existing books are still valid. The newly formatted books\
  \ consolidate key information in a unified place—for example, <em>Pathfinder Player\
  \ Core</em> will collect all the important rules for each of its featured classes\
  \ in one volume rather than spreading out key information between the <em>Core Rulebook</em>\
  \ and the <em>Advanced Player’s Guide</em>. </p> \n     <p>The new core rulebooks\
  \ will also serve as a new foundation for our publishing partners, transitioning\
  \ the game away from the Open Game License that caused so much controversy earlier\
  \ this year to the more stable and reliable <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6si9y?First-Draft-of-the-ORC-License-Ready-for\"\
  >Open RPG Creative (ORC) license</a>, which is currently being finalized with the\
  \ help of hundreds of independent RPG publishers. This transition will result in\
  \ a few minor modifications to the Pathfinder Second Edition system, notably the\
  \ removal of alignment and a small number of nostalgic creatures, spells, and magic\
  \ items exclusive to the OGL. These elements remain a part of the corpus of Pathfinder\
  \ Second Edition rules for those who still want them, and are fully compatible with\
  \ the new remastered rules, but will not appear in future Pathfinder releases.</p>\
  \ \n     <br> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/8a81ff8d-513f-46ea-b195-df3722cfeac8/GMCore-CoverMock_1200.png\"\

  \ \n     <br> \n     <p>In the meantime, Pathfinder’s remaining projects and product\
  \ schedule remain as-is and compatible with the newly remastered rules. This July’\
  s <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02eal?Pathfinder-Rage-of-Elements\"><em>Rage\
  \ of Elements</em></a> hardcover, along with the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/setting\"\
  >Lost Omens</a> campaign setting books and our regular monthly <a href=\"https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath\"\
  >Adventure Path</a> volumes, continue as planned, as does the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/pathfinderSociety/getstarted\"\
  >Pathfinder Society</a> Organized Play campaign, which will incorporate the new\
  \ rules as they become available.</p> \n     <center>\n      <h2>Learn more with\
  \ our <a href=\"https://paizo.com/pathfinder/remaster/faq\">FAQ here</a> or read\
  \ it below</h2>\n     </center> \n     <p><b>Is this a new edition of Pathfinder?</b></p>\
  \ \n     <p>No. The Pathfinder Second Edition Remaster Project does not change the\
  \ fundamental core system design of Pathfinder. Small improvements and cosmetic\
  \ changes appear throughout, but outside of a few minor changes in terminology,\
  \ the changes are not anywhere substantive enough to be considered a new edition.\
  \ We like Pathfinder Second Edition. You like Pathfinder Second Edition. This is\
  \ a remastered version of the original, not a new version altogether.</p> \n   \
  \  <p><strong>Are my existing Pathfinder Second Edition books now obsolete?</strong></p>\
  \ \n     <p>No. With the exception of a few minor variations in terminology and\
  \ a slightly different mix of monsters, spells, and magic items, the rules remain\
  \ largely unchanged. A pre-Remaster stat block, spell, monster, or adventure should\
  \ work with the remastered rules without any problems. </p> \n     <p><b>What does\
  \ this mean for my digital content?</b></p> \n     <p>Paizo is working with its\
  \ digital partners to integrate new system updates in the most seamless way possible.\
  \ The new rules will be uploaded to <a href=\"https://2e.aonprd.com/\">Archives\
  \ of Nethys</a> as usual, and legacy content that does not appear in the remastered\
  \ books will not disappear from online rules.</p> \n     <p>We will not be updating\
  \ PDFs of legacy products with the updated rules. </p> \n     <p><b>Will the Pathfinder\
  \ Second Edition Remaster books be part of my ongoing Pathfinder Rulebooks subscription?</b></p>\
  \ \n     <p>Pathfinder Second Edition Remaster books will be included in ongoing\
  \ Pathfinder Rulebooks subscriptions. We are currently working on a method whereby\
  \ existing subscribers will have the opportunity to “opt out” of these volumes if\
  \ they wish and will provide additional details as we get closer to the release\
  \ of the first two volumes.</p> \n     <p><b>What impact will the Second Edition\
  \ Remaster have on <a href=\"https://paizo.com/pathfinderSociety\">Pathfinder Society</a>\
  \ Organized Play?</b></p> \n     <p>We are working closely with our <a href=\"https://paizo.com/organizedplay\"\
  >Organized Play</a> team to seamlessly integrate new rules options in the upcoming\
  \ books as those books are released, as normal. In the rare case of a conflict between\
  \ a new book and legacy source, campaign management will provide clear advice with\
  \ as little disruption as possible to player characters or the campaign itself.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Will there be more Remastered Core books to come? What about <em>Monster\
  \ Core 2</em> or <em>Player Core 3</em>?</p> \n     <p>It’s very likely that we\
  \ will continue to update and remaster the Bestiaries in the future, but for now\
  \ we’re focusing on the four announced books as well as Paizo’s regular schedule\
  \ of Pathfinder releases. Publishing 100% new material remains Paizo’s primary focus,\
  \ and we look forward to upcoming releases like <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02eal?Pathfinder-Rage-of-Elements\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Rage of Elements</em></a>, the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6si92?Tian-Xia-Coming-2023-2024\"\
  ><em>Lost Omens Tian Xia World Guide</em> and <em>Character Guide</em></a>, our\
  \ monthly Adventure Path installments, and other exciting projects we have yet to\
  \ announce.</p> \n     <p><b>Will the new Pathfinder Second Edition Remaster books\
  \ have Special Editions?</b></p> \n     <p>Yes. We are looking into various exciting\
  \ print options for these books and will post more information soon. </p> \n   \
  \  <p><b>Will the new Pathfinder Second Edition Remaster books have Pocket Editions?</b></p>\
  \ \n     <p>Yes. Pocket editions of the new books will appear roughly three months\
  \ following the hardcover releases.</p> \n     <p><b>Will these changes impact the\
  \ Starfinder Roleplaying Game?</b></p> \n     <p>Not yet.</p> \n     <p><b>How can\
  \ I learn more about the Pathfinder Second Edition Remaster books?</b></p> \n  \
  \   <p>To learn more about the Remaster books, check out our live stream chat about\
  \ the announcement happening <a href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/officialpaizo\">later\
  \ today on Twitch</a>. Beyond that, we’ll be making a handful of additional announcements\
  \ in the coming days and weeks to showcase more about this exciting project, culminating\
  \ in your first full look at the project during <a href=\"https://paizo.com/paizocon\"\
