  description\">The world hides many secrets, some strange, some wondrous, and others\
  \ far too terrible for the rational mind to contain. In just over a month, we'll\
  \ be unveiling some of these secrets with the release of <a href=\"/products/btpy9egu\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Occult Adventures</em></a>. Within the pages of\
  \ this mysterious 272-page book, we'll uncover the secrets of the occult and detail\
  \ those who wield its might. In the meantime, we'll be previewing all six of the\
  \ book's new classes, and investigate a new type of spellcasting power to add to\
  \ your game—psychic magic!</p> \n    <p>First up is a class that harnesses the intrinsic\
  \ power of ancient or psychically charged items, and then channels mental power\
  \ through these items to cast powerful psychic spells: the occultist.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>The occultist is a psychic spellcaster who uses rare and powerful objects called\
  \ implements to manifest his magic. Each implement belongs to a specific school\
  \ of magic and, as the occultist grows in power, he gains the use of more and more\
  \ of these implements, increasing his power and the number of spells he can cast.\
  \ In addition, he has a reservoir of mental focus to invest into these implements.\
  \ Doing so not only grants him additional abilities, he can expend that focus to\
  \ create even more powerful effects.</p> \n    <p>For those who took part in the\
  \ <em>Occult Adventures</em> playtest, you'll find a number of things have changed\
  \ during the development of this class. The biggest change involves the resonant\
  \ powers of implements. Such powers are gained by putting mental focus into the\
  \ item and, when more focus is stored within it, the item's power increases. In\
  \ the final version, these resonant powers are not diminished as the mental focus\
  \ is spent. As long as there is at least one point of mental focus remaining, the\
  \ power remains at full strength! To add to the fun, each implement also had a few\
  \ additional focus powers you can choose from.</p> \n    <p>The occultist is also\
  \ very skilled at using magic circles to protect allies and hinder foes. At higher\
  \ levels the occultist can use these circles to a trap enemies. After the playtest,\
  \ we added a new ability utilizing magic circles. The occultist can now create a\
  \ magic circle to call upon a specific outsider—a contact from beyond that the occultist\
  \ can bribe or intimidate in exchange for aid. The occultist can use this outsider\
  \ to gather information and, at higher levels, that outsider can deliver messages\
  \ or small objects for the occultist. As the occultist advances in level, he learns\
  \ to call additional outsiders, creating a network of otherworldly allies.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Lastly, the occultist can cast psychic spells from the schools associated\
  \ with his implements. Since these are psychic spells, he does not have to worry\
  \ about somatic or verbal components, but he does have to have a clear mind and\
  \ steady emotional state to properly channel this type of magic. These components\
  \ are unique to psychic spellcasters and we'll be talking more about them in the\
  \ coming weeks.</p> \n    <p>Well, those are all the secrets we dare share with\
  \ you this week. Next week we'll be delving into the history of Rivani, and looking\
  \ at the powers of the psychic!</p> \n    <p>Jason Bulmahn<br> <i>Lead Designer</i></p>\
