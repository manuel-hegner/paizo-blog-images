  \   </table> \n   <blockquote> \n    <p>Has it really been 28 years already? It\
  \ seems like only yesterday that my friend Rich Rydberg and I were setting up our\
  \ tent at a campground in Kenosha, Wisconsin, and excitedly talking about our first\
  \ Gen Con. The year was 1984, and Rich was in my AD&amp;D group at St. Olaf College,\
  \ in Northfield, Minnesota. For the previous three years, we had seen all the coverage\
  \ on Gen Con in <i>Dragon</i> magazine and dreamed about going to the king of all\
  \ conventions, but it took until 1984 for all the stars to align.</p> \n    <p>The\
  \ convention wasn't very big back in those days. The Parkside gymnasium where the\
  \ dealer hall was located was hot as heck. But you could see all the luminaries\
  \ of gaming easily. I ran into Gary Gygax the first day I was at the con! I even\
  \ got Clyde Caldwell to draw a picture of my first D&amp;D character, and it sits\
  \ on my wall here at work. The biggest discovery for Rich and me was the RPGA. Since\
  \ this was our first convention, we had registered for a bunch of random AD&amp;D\
  \ games, and boy were some of them bad. We hadn't realized how good our home game\
  \ was compared to some of the games we played in at the con. RPGA changed all that\
  \ with great adventures run by some of the best DMs in the business!</p> \n    <p>The\
  \ RPGA became the center of my Gen Con world for the next four years as the convention\
  \ moved to the MECCA convention center in Milwaukee. I literally played RPGA events\
  \ from early morning on Thursday until the last slot on Sunday. Frank Mentzer ran\
  \ me through <i>The Temple of Elemental Evil</i>. I got to play in the first Oriental\
  \ Adventures tournament. And slowly, I rose to the top, becoming one of the first\
  \ Grand Masters and eventually Paragon players.</p> \n    <p>Now, RPGA tournaments\
  \ were a lot different back then. This was before Living City, so all the tournaments\
  \ were either skill challenges like the AD&amp;D Open, or they were roleplaying-based\
  \ tournaments, where you were given a random character and you had to roleplay it\
  \ on the spot, and at the end of the tournament, your fellow players graded all\
  \ the players at the table, with the one with the highest total winning that table!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Of course, it wasn't all RPGA. One convention, I got to play in the first\
  \ public game using the AD&amp;D Battlesystem, and Rich and my opponents were none\
  \ other than Ed Greenwood of Forgotten Realms fame, and Mike Nystul, whose character\
  \ created <i>Nystul's magic aura</i> among other things.</p> \n    <p>My RPGA years\
  \ came to an abrupt end when I started my first gaming company, Lion Rampant. In\
  \ 1987, we released <i>Whimsy Cards</i> and the highlight of my show was selling\
  \ a pack to Dave Arneson. The next year, we came out with Ars Magica and it won\
  \ Best Game of the Year in the RPGA Gamer's Choice Awards. I'll never forget Rich\
  \ yelling at me from across the dealer hall as he raced from the RPGA breakfast\
  \ banquet carrying our trophy.</p> \n   </blockquote> \n   <table align=\"right\"\

  \ went by and Gen Con became a business convention for me. As I entered the business\
  \ side, I got to meet all of the luminaries of the industry and talk with them as\
  \ peers. Gen Con was very social, with deals being talked about at the Safe House\
  \ late at night. I went from Lion Rampant to White Wolf to Wizards of the Coast\
  \ in the span of five years. Check out the crazy picture of me at the first Wizards\
  \ of the Coast booth. We shared the booth with a small little internet start-up,\
  \ America Online. Back then, it was all Talislanta and The Primal Order, but Magic:\
  \ The Gathering would become the shot heard around the world in 1993.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>Magic almost didn't make it to Gen Con in '93. The shipment got delayed in\
  \ customs and I literally had to have it put on an airplane so that it arrived Saturday\
  \ morning at the convention. Word had spread of the game and we literally sold it\
  \ as fast as we could take money and write receipts. The next year, we had lines\
  \ that wrapped around the convention hall, with people standing in line for many\
  \ hours to get limited quantities of <i>Arabian Nights</i>, <i>Legends</i>, <i>Antiquities</i>,\
  \ and <i>The Dark</i>.</p> \n    <p>One cool Gen Con moment happened one year when\
  \ the staff of TSR and the rest of the industry agreed to a huge Nerf gun fight\
  \ in the TSR Castle before the hall opened up for business. All the other companies\
  \ ganged up on the TSR folks and a ton of fun was had by all as we all blasted each\
  \ other with Nerf until we laughed ourselves silly. Imagine over 100 of the industry's\
  \ finest running around screaming like kids. It was magical.</p> \n    <p>My next\
  \ favorite Gen Con memory was when I worked the TSR Castle as a member of the TSR\
  \ staff in 1997 after Wizards of the Coast bought the company. I was one of a handful\
  \ of WotC employees who stayed in Lake Geneva that summer and became part of the\
  \ D&amp;D brand team when the staff transitioned to Seattle later that year. But\
  \ for the summer of 1997, I worked at TSR and tradition was that the TSR staff all\
  \ worked hard at Gen Con each year. Wearing my TSR shirt and talking fans off the\
  \ ledge (everyone was worried about what was going to happen to D&amp;D now that\
  \ WotC had bought it) in the TSR Castle are moments I will always cherish!</p> \n\
  \    <p>At Gen Con 1999, I was part of the team that announced the impending release\
  \ of the third edition of D&amp;D the next year. We had this huge auditorium where\
  \ we trotted out guest after guest from Gygax and Arneson to Cook and Adkison. Seeing\
  \ the excitement as we let a lot of the cats out of the bag was really cool. And\
  \ then everyone got one of my favorite t-shirts, the one where it had a list of\
  \ things people didn't like about previous editions that were getting fixed in third.</p>\

  \ \n   <blockquote> \n    <p>2002 was my first Gen Con as an owner of Paizo. We\
  \ had a small table in the WotC booth, where we sold subscriptions to <i>Dragon</i>,\
  \ <i>Dungeon</i>, and <i>Star Wars Insider</i>. 2003 had us schlepping Silver Boba\
  \ Fetts. 2004 was the year of the <i>Undefeated</i> cheerleaders. 2005 saw the mountain\
  \ of <i>Shackled City</i> hardcovers. 2006 saw the release of our GameMastery line\
  \ of system independent products.</p> \n    <p>Another great moment was 2007, the\
  \ year we launched the Pathfinder Adventure Path line. Knowing that <i>Dragon</i>\
  \ and <i>Dungeon</i> were going away, but that we had this awesome line of adventure\
  \ product that included some of the best folks in the industry, was satisfying.\
  \ 2008 saw the release of the <i>Pathfinder RPG Beta</i>. All of us were floored\
  \ when we sold out of the print version of our Beta playtest. I thought we would\
  \ be burning the unsold copies. Now it is a collector's item!</p> \n    <p>Of course,\
  \ the year 2009 saw the release of the <i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i>. The\
  \ buzz had been amazing building up to this release, but we weren't prepared for\
  \ the rush of people trying to be the first to buy the book. The Paizo staff ran\
  \ around like shepherds, trying to tame a semblance of order into 500+ people descending\
  \ on the booth at the same time. By the time the line went around the booth and\
  \ into the art show area, I knew something had to happen. So Erik and I grabbed\
  \ a bag and offered to let people give us $60, get their book, and get out of the\
  \ line. Many people took us up on that offer.</p> \n    <p>Now 2011 Gen Con is just\
  \ a few weeks away. I wonder what stories will be crafted from the Best Four Days\
  \ in Gaming this year?</p>\n    <br> <b>Lisa's Gen Con Pictures</b> \n   </blockquote>\
