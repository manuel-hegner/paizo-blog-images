  \     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">All hail King Merlokrep,\
  \ First of His Name, All-Mighty King of the Truescale Kobolds, and Bearer of the\
  \ Crown of the Kobold King!</p> \n      <p>Originally envisioned to compliment the\
  \ longer-form campaign play offered in the Pathfinder Adventure Path, our standalone\
  \ adventure line has visited a staggering number of locations and featured an equally\
  \ staggering number of villains and plots. This month we’re returning to where it\
  \ all started, with a compilation, revision, and expansion of a series of adventures\
  \ tied together by one very infamous kobold, King Merlokrep!</p> \n      <p>The\
  \ original adventure began with <em>Hollow’s Last Hope</em> (written by Jason Bulmahn\
  \ and F. Wesley Schneider), which had the distinction of being the first published\
  \ adventure module set in Golarion. It was soon followed up by <em>Crown of the\
  \ Kobold King</em> (written by Nicolas Logue). A sequel further expanding this adventure’\
  s location, <em>Hungry are the Dead</em> (written by Tim Hitchcock) came out several\
  \ months later—all before we published the first edition of the Pathfinder Roleplaying\
  \ Game!</p> \n      <p>I hope you enjoy this latest incarnation of <em>Crown of\
  \ the Kobold King</em> (which features a brand-new level of the dungeon created\
  \ by Nicolas Logue)! It was a blast going through these old adventures and marveling\
  \ at not just how much has changed over nearly two decades, but also how those early\
  \ adventures set the foundation for the world of Golarion. Let us know if you enjoyed\
  \ this adventure, and in particular, enjoyed the format of reprinting, revising,\
  \ and expanding classic adventures in hardcover format. There are quite a few other\
  \ standalone adventures in the Paizo library I’m eager to update in a similar manner,\
  \ but at the same time, rest assured we’ll continue to create new mysteries, locales,\
  \ and foes in the standalone adventure line as well!</p> \n      <p>While compiling\
  \ the revised <em>Crown of the Kobold King</em> into a single book and updating\
  \ it with Pathfinder Second Edition rules, as well as a very changed world (both\
  \ in game and out), we reached out to a couple of the original authors for their\
  \ memories of working on these foundational Pathfinder adventures. And for a further\
  \ dive into the making of this edition of <em>Crown of the Kobold King</em> (including\
  \ some words from Jason Bulmahn on the creation of <em>Hollow’s Last Hope</em>),\

  \ year was 2007. The print era of <em>Dragon and Dungeon Magazine</em> had come\
  \ to an end... magazines I’d loved since learning to read, both of which I’d become\
  \ a prolific freelance contributor for in the years prior. My grief turned to jubilation\
  \ on a dime when I was approached to write the first ever module set in Golarion:\
  \ the iconic <em>Crown of the Kobold King</em>.</p> \n      <p>I wrote the entire\
  \ module and appendices in one night in a Guayaki Yerba Mate-fueled bender of pure\
  \ joyful creation. From my perch on a second-hand futon, I banged away maniacally\
  \ at my laptop, with an empty cardboard box serving as my table, as it was the only\
  \ other piece of furniture I owned at that time. That night, Droskar grew in power,\
  \ and the hardy frontier town of Falcon’s Hollow was hewn from the misty eaves at\
  \ the edge of Darkmoon Vale.</p> \n      <p>Keeping with tradition, about a year\
  \ later, I wrote the entirety of <em>Revenge of the Kobold King</em> on an Amtrak\
  \ ride from Penn Station to Niagara Falls.</p> \n      <p>Years later in 2012, the\
  \ mad genius himself, James Jacobs, reached out and offered me the chance to create\
  \ a secret hidden level in the dungeon for a future special edition. I drove to\
  \ the store, picked up several more cans of Guayaki Yerba Mate, and 8 hours later\
  \ as dawn rose, I finished the manuscript.</p> \n      <p>To my memory, no other\
  \ modules in my sprawling body of work were written in crucibles as smolderingly\
  \ taut as those collected in this exciting hardcover anniversary edition.</p> \n\
  \      <p>What will I do with my copy when it arrives? Who knows? Maybe I'll finally\
  \ playtest it!</p> \n      <p>May all your hits be crits, kobold-lovers!</p> \n\
  \      <br> \n      <h3>F. Wesley Schneider</h3> \n      <p><em>Hollow’s Last Hope</em>\
  \ was all about firsts. As the premiere adventure in a new series in a new world,\
  \ every choice had weight. Who would be Golarion’s first non-player character? What\
  \ sort of creature would be its first monster? What kinds of adventures would characters\
  \ find? From those earliest decisions, we glimpsed a world that would develop far\
  \ beyond Darkmoon Vale. While certain choices would fade, the underlying foundations\
  \ of inclusivity, legendary inspiration, and reinvention would color so much of\
  \ what followed.</p> \n     </blockquote> \n    </div> <!-- tags: Pathfinder, Pathfinder\
