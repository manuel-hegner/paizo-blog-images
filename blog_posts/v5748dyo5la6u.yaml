  \ Revealed</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, May 29, 2007</p> \n   <blockquote>\
  \ \n    <p><i>Say what you will about their morality, the rulers of ancient Thassilon\
  \ knew how to govern. Knowing the horror that a full-scale duel between them would\
  \ unleash, the Runelords settled on an elegant means of solving disputes. Each of\
  \ the seven wizards created a unique blade imbued with the barest shadow of his\
  \ might, and whenever two disagreed, each would bestow his blade upon a chosen champion,\
  \ whose job it was to decide the matter in bloody arena combat. To be a champion\
  \ for one of the Runelords was the greatest honor a warrior could aspire to... though\
  \ generally a short-lived one.</i></p> \n    <p><i>While most of the great Thassilonian\
  \ wonders were shattered or lost in the empire's fall, there are those who whisper\
  \ that the swords themselves remain, hidden and awaiting hands to wield them. To\
  \ the Thassilonians, they were known as the Alara'hai, the Seven Blades of Conviction.\
  \ Given the Runelords' reputation, however, most scholars today know them by a different\
  \ name.</i> <br>—Pathfinder Chronicles</p> \n   </blockquote> \n   <p>A while back,\
  \ it was decided that Paizo would run a delve at this year's GenCon—an enormous\
  \ three-dimensional dungeon that would allow participants to walk up to the booth\
  \ and play 15 minutes of D&amp;D for free, battling an array of cruel traps and\
  \ monsters and collecting keys that could potentially win them real-world treasure\
  \ (the exact nature of which I'm not allowed to reveal yet, but trust me—it's some\
  \ quality loot). In keeping with the spirit of things, we decided to make the creation\
  \ of the delve into something of a game itself—each interested member of the Paizo\
  \ staff was assigned a few rooms and an EL range and told to fill it with unique\
  \ traps and monsters, with the goal being to see whose room could kill the most\
  \ players at the convention. People went to work with gusto, and soon the delve\
  \ was a bizarre menagerie of deadly encounters, each stranger than the last. But\
  \ as the idea germinated, we came to realize that this delve was too cool to be\
  \ a one-shot deal—there had to be a published product. We could take the established\
  \ rooms, add enough new dungeon encounters and plot elements to double its size,\
  \ and weave a storyline that tied it all together. Everyone agreed that it was a\
  \ good idea, and soon the adventure had a vague concept, a title, and a slot on\
  \ the release schedule. Time went by, and the process rolled onward without issue.\
  \ Then one day in a product meeting, someone asked who was going to be revising\
  \ the rooms and writing all the extra content.</p> \n   <p>\"Oh,\" said GameMastery\
  \ Brand Manager Jason Bulmahn. \"Sutter is.\"</p> \n   <p>I was drinking at the\
  \ time, and promptly coughed tea into my sinuses. \"What?\" I squeaked.</p> \n \
  \  <p>\"Surprise!\" Bulmahn said. \"I thought it would be more fun to tell you this\
  \ way. You'll have a month to write it. Get to work.\"</p> \n   <p>Thus was born\
  \ <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7wiz\"><i>GameMastery Module D2: Seven Swords of Sin</i></a>.\
  \ In the weeks that followed, we faced several unique challenges in developing this\
  \ adventure—things like finding a narrative that made sense of encounters like fiendish\
  \ goblins riding dinosaurs and living cauldrons spewing boiling magma, or coordinating\
  \ the numerous tie-ins with the Rise of the Runelords Adventure Path—but at the\
  \ end of the day I'm really happy with how the adventure turned out. In <i>Swords</i>,\
  \ PCs discover that a powerful sorceress named Tirana has stolen numerous powerful\
  \ magical weapons dating back to the days of ancient Thassilon, and are contracted\
  \ by the Church of Abadar to recover them before she figures out how to unlock their\
  \ full power. To do so, the PCs track the thief back to Kaer Maga, an anarchic outlaw\
  \ city built entirely inside the ruins of a great Thassilonian structure (and my\
  \ favorite part of the module, but more on that in later posts). Once there, they\
  \ have to locate Tirana's headquarters and descend into an abandoned research facility\
  \ filled with traps and monstrous guardians, finally coming face-to-face with the\
  \ wizard herself, who wields the legendary Sword of Lust. </p>\n   <p>With several\
  \ new monsters and magic items, a squatter metropolis on a cliff, a deadly dungeon\
  \ with an old-school, <i>Tomb of Horrors</i> feel, and pages of art as gorgeous\
  \ as the cover shown above, I'm hoping this module will have something for everyone.</p>\
