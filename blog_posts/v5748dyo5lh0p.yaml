  articleBody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Ahoy, me hearties! It's been a\
  \ while since I've written something for you scabrous dogs... since last year in\
  \ fact! (That's my stupid New Year's joke, which is something I will try to refrain\
  \ from doing for the rest of this blog. No promises, though.) Anyway, I'm super\
  \ stoked about what's in adventure deck five—it's the <a href=\"/products/btpy97lv\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Adventure Card Game: The Price of Infamy Adventure Deck</em></a>—\
  so there will be none of my usual blah blah blah at the beginning of this post because\
  \ the less I write here, the sooner we get to the sweet stuff. Onward to the Obligatory\
  \ Shark Section!</p> \n    <h2>OSS (Obligatory Shark Section)</h2> \n    <p>I have\
  \ a confession to make. A long time ago, I told you there was a shark in every adventure.\
  \ That was maybe not totally true. There is no shark here. However, there is something\
  \ even better. Something so good it deserves its very own one-time super special\
  \ deluxe section. Ready?</p> \n    <h2>Do you want to build a Galvo?</h2> \n   \
  \ <p>I have another confession. I just saw <em>Frozen</em>. No really, not like\
  \ you, who watched it last week for the fifteenth time. I just saw <em>Frozen</em>\
  \ FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER. And by forever I mean, for the first time ever.\
  \ EVER. So, there's gonna be a little bit of that going on in here. I'm sorry, but\
  \ I won't stop. Honestly, I probably couldn't even if I wanted to because holy sea\
  \ cucumber, those songs are catchy. So, on to the Galvo... </p>\n    <div class=\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> \n     <p><i><b>Question:</b> Is anything greater than a mass of\
  \ electric eels that forms a humanoid shape and works together to destroy things\
  \ it doesn't like?<br> <b>Answer:</b> No.</i></p>\n    </div> \n    <p>The Galvo\
  \ is my favorite thing in all of Skull &amp; Shackles. Just like the Wendigo is\
  \ my favorite from Rise of the Runelords (#teamwendigo4evs). But what makes the\
  \ Galvo so great? Everything. My love of galvos began when I read this line from\
  \ <em>The Price of Infamy</em>, \"There is no true Galvo society.\" I mean, how\
  \ do you not love that? Anyway, it just gets better from there. Baby galvos are\
  \ called \"tangles,\" which is stupid cute. I mean, seriously.</p> \n    <p>So,\
  \ what about the actual card? Well, you've got that \"before you act\" check. Yeah,\
  \ Galvos sometimes just spring out of the water and attack people, kind of like—\
  SPOILERS!—Azog in the newest <em>Hobbit</em>. Seriously, if you didn't see that\
  \ <em>Jaws</em> moment coming, well, I'm very disappointed. We have you make a Dexterity\
  \ or Acrobatics check to see if you can dodge that, or you'll be taking a little\
  \ bit of damage. ZAP! And of course, there's that swarm power. Galvos are nothing\
  \ if not persistent. I think they get that from Malvo. <em>Fargo</em> on FX, anyone?\
  \ (Watch it, seriously, so good. It's also got a <em>Hobbit</em> in it.)</p> \n\
  \    <p>I could talk about Galvos for probably an entire blog but I should move\
  \ on to some of the other sweet stuff this adventure contains. Anyway, you'll know\
  \ me at a convention if you see me wearing a Galvo Society shirt. But you can't\
  \ join because there is no true Galvo Society. I'm the only member.</p> \n    <h2>Other\
  \ Sweet Stuff</h2> \n    <p>There's a lot to love (and be afraid of) in this adventure.\
  \ Here are a few more things you should keep your eye out for.</p> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6015-Albatross.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6015-Albatross_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> \n     <p><i>Albatrosses are better than people... just like reindeer!</i></p>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>The good news is, the Albatross allows you to defeat a non-villain\
  \ bane. The bad news is, it flies away and you have to bury 1d4 cards from the top\
  \ of your deck. If you don't get why the Albatross does you some harm, you should\
  \ read \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\" which honestly, you should read anyway,\
  \ because it's amazing. You get 5 Cool Points if you've already read it, and 3 if\
  \ you read it after reading this.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\
  //static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6015-AlbatrossSoup.jpg\"><img\
  \ src=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6015-AlbatrossSoup_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> \n     <p><i>A man goes to a restaurant and orders albatross soup.\
  \ He takes one bite and immediately kills himself. Why?</i></p>\n    </div> \n \
  \   <p>I have to confess, Mike and I really wanted this card in the game because\
  \ we're really big into puzzles and riddles, not because there is some big part\
  \ of the Skull &amp; Shackles story centered around <a href=\"http://forums.xkcd.com/viewtopic.php?t=9491\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">albatross soup</a>. <i>[Mike says: Click at your peril.]</i>\
  \ That doesn't mean this card is something you don't need to take seriously, though.\
  \ You will banish or bury at least one card when dealing with this. Banishing one\
  \ of your allies will make this go away, but banishing your friends isn't very nice.\
  \ They're your friends, so why would you do that? Or, you could just bury the top\
  \ card of your deck and really hope you don't blow it when you try to make the Constitution\
  \ or Fortitude check and also hope that the card you bury isn't that one card that\
  \ you need that would make everything totally groovy, if you had it. If you bury,\
  \ roll, and lose, even more people will get to decide how they deal with this troubling\
  \ soup. </p>\n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6015-Kapre.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6015-Kapre_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> \n     <p><i>Groot + cigar = Kapre. Sort of.</i></p>\n    </div>\
  \ \n    <p>Kapres are basically the cigar-smoking tree-huggers of Skull &amp; Shackles.\
  \ No, literally, they can meld with trees, which is basically the ninja level of\
  \ tree-hugging. These guys go around smoking cigars and defending nature. How badass\
  \ is that? Very. Anyway, if you wander into some Kapre territory, they blow some\
  \ cigar smoke at you and you get all confounded and wander away, leaving the nature\
  \ natural. Plus, you can use your Charisma or Diplomacy to befriend the Kapre, but\
  \ even though the Kapre likes you now, its cigar smoke is still enough to persuade\
  \ you to just leave the location you're at. If you're not wise and just blunder\
  \ around ruining the Kapre's territory, it's gonna deal you damage, and if you're\
  \ smart, you'll get the heck outta Dodge after that. I like the Kapre, and I think\
  \ you should not fight them and instead be their friends.</p> \n    <h2>Scenario\
  \ Info</h2> \n    <p>There are some things that are just better when served cold.\
  \ Ice cream, for one. I'll be honest with you, I pretty much like almost all leftovers\
  \ cold and unheated. Spaghetti, pad thai, mattar paneer, pretty much anything goes.\
  \ Unless it's supposed to be crispy, then you gotta heat that in the oven. There's\
  \ one other thing that is also better cold: revenge. Why all this talk of serving\
  \ things cold? Well, it just so happens that the name of the scenario I'll be telling\
  \ you about today is called \"Best Served Cold.\" And it's pretty bonkers.</p> \n\

  \ she has to. As in, unless there are basically no cards besides her in a location,\
  \ she's going to do some damage to you and dip out until later. Once you manage\
  \ to get her to pay attention long enough to fight you, she's going to be real unhappy\
  \ about any of your Divine spell nonsense. Bury ‘em. And then beat Luccaria, so\

  \    </div> \n    <p>Gilbrok's a bit of a fixer-upper. Nobody gave him etiquette\
  \ lessons when he was a kid, so he doesn't know it's rude to stick his tongue out\
  \ like that. Also, it's seriously icky. If you aren't Swashbuckling when you go\
  \ after Gilbrok, you won't scare him with your piratical prowess, and you'll have\
  \ to subtract 1 from each die you roll. Oofda. And then, when you don't defeat him\
  \ because his freaky-deaky tongue throws you off your game, you'll get to encounter\
  \ one of these curses.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6015-BreathOfDagon.jpg\"\

  \ cartoon out there with a dog named Kipper, and it's about this sweet little dog\
  \ and his friends. This Kipper is not sweet. And you've read about his friends—\
  they're jerks. This Kipper shoots first and doesn't ask questions later. He's doesn't\
  \ care who you are or where you are. When somebody runs into him, he's just gonna\
  \ shoot someone. Not cool, dude. Plus, if you don't impress him with your swashbuckliness\
  \ on your check to defeat, any damage he deals to you is going to be increased by\
  \ 6. It's probably best for you to avoid Kipper if you can, or just pound him into\
  \ the ground, so he's gone forever.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"\
  //static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6015-ErinyesDevil.jpg\"><img\
  \ src=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6015-ErinyesDevil_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> \n     <p><i>Bye bye, blessings!</i></p>\n    </div> \n    <p>When\
  \ we were writing this game months and months ago, we needed to add another power\
  \ to the Erinyes Devil, and I suggested that perhaps these Divine-hating ladies\
  \ should banish any of your boons with the Divine trait. And now they do. Oops.\
  \ #sorrynotsorry. I am sorry that I just used #sorrynotsorry, though. Anyway, watch\
  \ out for the Erinyes Devils. Hopefully, you can fight them without needing help\
  \ from your friends. By the way, if I was in your party, I probably wouldn't help\
  \ you. Those are my blessings, and I worked hard to get them, and I'm not gonna\
  \ banish them just cause you bumped into an Erinyes Devil. This game is more cooperative\
  \ for some than it is for others. Anyway, smash the devil, and send her away forever.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>You may have notice by now that there are lot of small confessions in\
  \ this blog. Well, I have one more. When I told you that you should get rid of Luccaria,\
  \ Gilbrok, Kipper, and the Erinyes Devils, I was maybe sort of not telling you everything.\
  \ When I said they would go away forever, what I meant was \"they will go in a henchman\
  \ pile, and when you encounter Barnabas Harrigan, each character will have to summon\
  \ and encounter one of them.\" That's pretty much the same thing, right?</p> \n\
  \    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6015-Barnabas.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6015-Barnabas_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     <br> \n     <p><i>Ring, ring, ring, ring Barnabasphone!</i></p>\n  \
  \  </div> \n    <p>So, even though those henchman are really awful to fight, it's\
  \ still probably better to deal with one of them than to have to deal with Barnabas.\
  \ First, you're going to have to succeed at a Wisdom or Perception 14 check or the\
  \ checks to defeat him are going to be increased by 6. And you've lost the opportunity\
  \ to evade him. Then, before any check to defeat him—note: there are 2—you must\
  \ recharge an armor or 1d4 other cards. And if you were dumb enough to think you\
  \ could go barging up to Barnabas with a big group of friends, you have to discard\
  \ those cards instead. Yipes. Then, when you're done with all that and you've made\
  \ checks to defeat him—which, let's be honest, you probably failed—you have to knock\
  \ some cards off the blessings deck. Or, if you're swashbuckly, just the top card.\
  \ Yowza. Like I said earlier, lots to be excited about and lots to be afraid of.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Anyway, I hope you enjoyed this blog and have been enjoying the game.\
  \ I know I did. I also have one last confession for you. Best Served Cold might\
  \ be our revenge against all you who said the game was too easy.</p> \n    <p>Until\
  \ next time, you salty sea dogs! I gotta go sing more botched <em>Frozen</em> lyrics\
  \ to myself.</p> \n    <p>Gaby Weidling<br> <i>Adventure Card Game Developer</i></p>\
