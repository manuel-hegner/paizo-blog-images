  \ Wesley Schneider (Part 1)</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Friday, July 3, 2009</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The Fabled Appendix continues! Yesterday I had the pleasure of interviewing\
  \ Pathfinder Managing Editor F. Wesley Schneider and Developer Sean K Reynolds about\
  \ the sources of inspiration they would include in Paizo's very own Appendix N.\
  \ Both had very different replies, which was fun to see. I'll begin with Wes, whose\
  \ early experiences with console RPGs and later introduction to horror literature\
  \ have coalesced to form a unique style all his own.</p> \n    <p>Alas, today is\
  \ my last day as an editorial intern, so these Appendix N blog posts will be the\
  \ last I write. With any luck, however, future interns will continue where I leave\
  \ off!</p> \n    <p><b>David</b>: I understand that World of Darkness, Ravenloft,\
  \ and Call of Cthulhu were some of your first loves when it came to roleplaying\
  \ settings. How much were those influences on your game design today?</p> \n   \
  \ <p><b>Wes:</b> Those games and settings both were and weren't influences. My majors\
  \ inspirations tend to come more from the things that inspired those worlds than\
  \ from the games themselves, from authors like Walpole, Lovecraft, Shelly, Stoker,\
  \ Poe, Le Fanu, and Crane. I really enjoy finding the more obscure early horror\
  \ writers, people who wrote when horror wasn't even truly considered a genre and\
  \ their tales were more often regarded as ghost stories or dark romances. I've also\
  \ always been very interested in mythologies from a wide variety of cultures and\
  \ time periods. What began as a childhood fascination with Greek myth took the typical\
  \ evolution into Norse and Egyptian legends, and gradually turned into an interest\
  \ in folklore in general–especially South and Eastern Europe, Middle Eastern, and\
  \ East Asian.</p> \n    <p>Also, having been the young guy at Paizo for a long time,\
  \ I've always felt that I come from the generation after a number of my coworkers.\
  \ Talking to Erik and James, it becomes clear that their background is in 1st edition\
  \ D&amp;D and the literature listed in the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>’s original\
  \ Appendix N. But I didn’t start playing D&amp;D until mid-2nd edition. Although\
  \ I have great respect for it and the origins of the game, I never played in Greyhawk,\
  \ getting most of my early D&amp;D exposure through the Forgotten Realms, Ravenloft,\
  \ Planescape, and their novels. Even before these, though, probably my earliest\
  \ introduction to RPGs came with the Nintendo Entertainment System in the late '80s.\
  \ I remember getting a NES for Christmas and it coming with a coupon for <i>Nintendo\
  \ Power</i> magazine, and if I used the coupon I could also get the game Dragon\
  \ Warrior for free. Of course, Dragon Warrior led to Final Fantasy, which led to\
  \ Shadow Gate and the D&amp;D “Gold Box” games, and so on and so on to this day.\
  \ So, for as long as I've been a D&amp;D gamer, I've been a computer and video game\
  \ player.</p> \n    <br> \n    <p>This concludes Part 1 of my interview with Wes\
  \ Schneider. Stay tuned for Part 2, in which he discusses how Golarion is like a\
  \ melting pot of ideas and lists his favorite, most recent sources of gothic horror!</p>\
