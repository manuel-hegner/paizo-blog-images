  \     </div> \n     <p>The <a href=\"http://carlbrandon.org/\" target=\"_blank\"\
  >Carl Brandon Society</a> seeks to expand racial and ethnic diversity in fiction.\
  \ “We envision a world in which speculative fiction, about complex and diverse cultures\
  \ from writers of all backgrounds, is used to understand the present and model possible\
  \ futures; and where people of color are full citizens in the community of imagination\
  \ and progress.” </p> \n     <p>“The <a href=\"https://www.naacpldf.org/\" target=\"\
  _blank\">NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.</a> is America’s premier\
  \ legal organization in the fight for racial justice. Through litigation, advocacy,\
  \ and public education, LDF seeks to achieve racial justice by enacting structural\
  \ changes to expand democracy, eliminate disparities in a society that fulfills\
  \ the promise of equality for all Americans. LDF also defends the gains and protections\
  \ won over the past 75 years of civil rights struggle and works to improve the quality\
  \ and diversity of judicial and executive appointments.” </p> \n     <p>The <a href=\"\
  https://nul.org/\" target=\"_blank\">National Urban League’s</a> mission is “To\
  \ help African-Americans and others in underserved communities achieve their highest\
  \ true social parity, economic self- reliance, power, and civil rights. The League\
  \ promotes economic empowerment through education and job training, housing and\
  \ community development, workforce development, entrepreneurship, health, and quality\
  \ of life.”</p> \n     <p>Purchasers can decide how much of their donation goes\
  \ to each participant in the bundle by scrolling down to the bottom of the Humble\
  \ Bundle page and clicking the “Choose where your money goes” header. </p> \n  \
  \   <p>Paizo is including its most popular Pathfinder products in this bundle. You\
  \ can get PDF copies of the Pathfinder Second Edition <em>Core Rulebook</em>, <em>Bestiary</em>,\
  \ and <em>Lost Omens World Guide</em>, as well as enough adventures to keep you\
  \ and your friends entertained for hours of epic gaming around the table or on virtual\
  \ tabletop. </p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/071420_HumbleBundle.png\"\
