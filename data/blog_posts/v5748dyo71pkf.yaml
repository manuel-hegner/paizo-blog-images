  \ style=\"font-size: 13px;\"></p>\n      </div>\n      <br>\n      <p>In this adventure\
  \ you play as four Protoframes sent to rescue a spy from a Corpus facility on Orias.\
  \ <em>Operation: Orias</em> is a taste of the <em>Warframe</em>setting using the\
  \ Starfinder Second Edition rules, designed to play with friends around the tabletop!\
  \ Gen Con attendees can stop by our demo area to play a snippet encounter of this\
  \ full adventure.</p>\n      <blockquote>\n       <p>I’ve been playing <em>Warframe</em>\
  \ off and on for many years now (11 years, according to the fun sigil I have in\
  \ game), and I’ve always had a great time with it. There’s not anything quite like\
  \ jumping around at intense speeds, slamming down with Rhino’s stomp, and completely\
  \ obliterating a dozen enemies in the span of two seconds. It’s those moments that\
  \ keep me coming back again and again.</p>\n       <p>I don’t know what possessed\
  \ me to contact Rebb Ford on that random Monday evening, but I suddenly felt a compulsion\
  \ to reach out. I’m a Creative Director. She’s a Creative Director. Maybe, just\
  \ maybe, we could link up and make something cool happen! I was floored with how\
  \ excited she was by me contacting her. A small meeting occurred shortly thereafter,\
  \ and I could feel that we were all giddy and excited to come together to make something\
  \ happen. The only question was what we would be able to make.</p>\n       <p>We\
  \ wanted something out as quick as we could, but our publishing schedules weren’\
  t built with an unexpected collaboration in mind. Something could happen, but it\
  \ would have to be slim and precise. We landed on a brief little taste for the universe\
  \ of <em>Warframe</em>, a mashup between Starfinder and <em>Warframe</em>.</p>\n\
  \       <p>I was fortunate enough to be asked to write a little adventure for this\
  \ collaboration, and I got to work with the inimitable Kengineer to make something\
  \ cool happen. Bringing <em>Warframe</em> to the tabletop was a fun challenge and\
  \ I’d like to think that I was able to translate the feel of being on an in-game\
  \ mission pretty well. Overall, this has been a super exciting and rewarding experience.\
  \ Working with DE has been nothing but a dream so far, and I hope that everyone\
  \ enjoys what we’ve put together. Until next time, Tenno!</p>\n       <p>—Luis Loza,\
  \ Creative Director (Pathfinder)</p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <br>\n      <blockquote>\n\
  \       <p>Hiya, it’s Jenny, Creative Manager of Starfinder. I’m not the one who\
  \ came up with this awesome idea or clenched the deal with Rebb, but Starfinder\
  \ is my department so I had to get involved at some point. Thurston and Luis arranged\
  \ the collaboration then suddenly told me they needed me to develop a super-secret\
  \ crossover project. Of course I was like, “OMG YES! I’m in!” See, Thursty and I\
  \ have played <em>Warframe</em>together quite a few times in the past. If you’re\
  \ curious about my history with <em>Warframe</em>, I’m a filthy casual with about\
  \ 300 hours played with friends on and off over a few years. I play Fashionframe,\
  \ so I choose Warframes based on aesthetic and vibes just as much as playstyle.\
  \ My favorites are Garuda, Jade, and Yareli. Anyway! I never imagined I’d get to\
  \ work with Digital Extremes to create an official crossover for their game. It\
  \ makes perfect sense though—Starfinder Second Edition and <em>Warframe</em> really\
  \ mesh! I can’t wait for you to play what Luis cooked up for you and experience\
  \ <em>Warframe</em> in tabletop form, combined with Starfinder Second Edition rules.</p>\n\
  \       <p>—Jenny Jarzabski, Creative Manager (Starfinder)</p>\n      </blockquote>\n\
  \      <blockquote>\n       <p>Thurston Hillman, Paizo Associate Publisher here!\
  \ In <em>Warframe</em>, I’m a longtime Caliban main. (This is an inside joke; I\
  \ actually was a Valkyr main for years but started saying this as soon as Caliban\
  \ released.)</p>\n       <p>So, there I was, at Gen Con chatting with Luis when\
  \ he mentioned this fun idea of reaching out to Rebb Ford at Digital Extremes about\
  \ doing something with Starfinder and <em>Warframe</em>. I said “Absolutely, you\
  \ should go and do that!” Cut to a few months later, when I’m sitting in a call\
  \ with Rebb and others from Digital Extremes, and excitedly chatting about potential\
  \ opportunities together. Hearing that several creative leads at Digital Extremes\
  \ were in the same Rise of the Runelords campaign brought it full circle, as many\
  \ of us at Paizo are avid fans of <em>Warframe</em>.</p>\n       <p>From that initial\
  \ meeting onwards, this collaboration has been a joy to work on, with both sides\
  \ sharing our excitement of our respective properties. We’ve worked together to\
  \ make this product that we can’t wait to share with both our communities.</p>\n\
  \       <p>—Thurston Hillman, Associate Publisher &amp; Longtime Caliban Main</p>\n\
  \      </blockquote>\n      <br>\n      <center>\n       <p>Join us in celebrating\
  \ this collaboration with Digital Extremes today on <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/officialpaizo\"\
