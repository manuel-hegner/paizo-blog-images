  >Hey Paizonians, Lone Shark has just turned over the files for the sixth wave of\
  \ class decks—which are sometimes called character decks now, because we're having\
  \ fun experimenting with new class-agnostic formats, but we can't stop calling them\
  \ class decks, and this is a really long sentence now. Anyway, the <a href=\"/products/btpy9qy9?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Magus-Class-Deck\"\
  ><em>Magus Class Deck</em></a>, the <a href=\"/products/btpy9s2e?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Pathfinder-Tales-Character-Deck\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Tales Character Deck</em></a>, and <a href=\"/products/btpy9s2o?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Hells-Vengeance-Character-Deck-1\"\
  ><em>Hell's Vengeance Character Deck 1</em></a> are all in Vic and Sonja's hands.\
  \ Suffice it to say, we went a bit nuts on the new cards in these sets. Maybe a\
  \ lot nuts.</p> \n   <p>We've also started work on the wave after that. <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9sjy?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Hells-Vengeance-Character-Deck-2\"\
  ><em>Hell's Vengeance Character Deck 2</em></a> concludes our trip to Evil Land.\
  \ This November deck features the pitborn assassin <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5liet?Meet-the-VillainsEmil-Kovkorin\"\
  >Emil</a>, the dhampir necromancer <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lis8?Meet-the-VillainsNyctessa\"\
  >Nyctessa</a>, and the human torturer <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lijt?Meet-the-VillainsZelhara\"\
  >Zelhara</a>. There's a whole lot of bad news in store for the allies in this set.\
  \ If you want more backstabbing, backbiting, and backbreaking than you can reasonably\
  \ imagine, this is the deck for you.</p> \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    <a\
  \ href=\"/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PZO1129-Hunter.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PZO1129-Hunter_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n    <p>Where my wolf at?</p>\n   </div> \n   <p>In December, we're going\
  \ to get a deck together for someone we've wanted to feature for a long time. <a\
  \ href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lgdk?Meet-the-Iconics-Adowyn\">Adowyn</a>, the hunter\
  \ we introduced in <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/wrathOfTheRighteous\"\
  >Wrath of the Righteous</a>, is going to get her own spotlight in the <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9sxh?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Hunter-Class-Deck\"><em>Hunter\
  \ Class Deck</em></a>, and of course her wolf Leryn is coming along for the chase.\
  \ People have been asking us to make Adowyn available in the <a href=\"/pfsacg\"\
  >Pathfinder Society Adventure Card Guild</a> for a year or more, but we never thought\
  \ we had the right deck. Now we will.</p> \n   <p>And then, this mic drop.</p> \n\
  \   <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PFACG-Iconics.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PFACG-Iconics_500.jpeg\"></a> \n    <p>The\
  \ brainy bunch.</p>\n   </div> \n   <p>The new year will kick off with <em>Occult\
  \ Adventures Character Deck 1</em>. Between it and its sequel, we'll be releasing\
  \ all six mental masters. You'll find new versions of three Mummy's Mask stalwarts—\
  the occultist <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lhmh?Meet-the-Iconics-Mavaro\">Mavaro</a>,\
  \ the spiritualist <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lhna?Meet-the-Iconics-Estra\"\
  >Estra</a>, and the adorable kineticist <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lhqz?Meet-the-Iconics-Yoon\"\
  >Yoon</a>—alongside three all-new characters: the psychic <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lhob?Meet-the-Iconics-Rivani\"\
  >Rivani</a>, the mesmerist <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lhpw?Meet-the-Iconics-Meligaster\"\
  >Meligaster</a>, and the medium <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lhoy?Meet-the-Iconics-Erasmus\"\
  >Erasmus</a>. Which three will be in which set? We don't know yet! We're actually\
  \ engaged in a Lockhorns-level imbroglio over who gets to design what with whom\
  \ here. We don't know what will happen!</p> \n   <p>If only we had a way to predict\
  \ the future. Ah well.</p> \n   <p>When we get done with these, we'll have made\
  \ <i>one hundred thirty-six characters</i> for the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game,\
  \ with no end in sight. It's been quite the creative process. And we'll keep it\
  \ up as long as you let us.</p> \n   <p>So those are some upcoming decks of characters\
  \ for you to play with. We'll preview all of these when we get closer to the release\
  \ dates. Thanks for playing!</p> \n   <p>Mike Selinker<br> <i>Adventure Card Game\
