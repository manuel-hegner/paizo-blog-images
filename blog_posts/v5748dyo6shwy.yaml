  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">It’s been a long journey,\
  \ but <em>Absalom, City of Lost Omens</em> is almost here! That means it’s time\
  \ for the authors of that book to step forward and take a bow. While the writers\
  \ of our Paizo products are always credited in the front and back of the books,\
  \ a simple name in a byline doesn’t give readers much information on the people\
  \ who work to bring the setting to life! I reached out to the authors with the intent\
  \ of promoting them—as well as any other personal work they would like to show off,\
  \ so that new fans of their work could find other projects, RPG products, websites,\
  \ livestreams, and more to enjoy! If there’s a section in the book that you particularly\
  \ liked, why not check out the author behind it today?</p> \n     <p style=\"margin-left:\

  m a freelance game designer and writer with indie projects of my own but also work\
  \ on games like the <em>Thirsty Sword Lesbians</em> expansion<em> Advanced Lovers\
  \ and Lesbians</em> (“Shinsei Galactic Puroresu: The Final Engagement — Revolution”\
  ), Brinkwood: The Blood of Tyrants (“The Scene Is Dead, Long Live The Scene”), and\
  \ <em>Into the Mother Lands</em>. Sealord Amodjun and Iolanthe were among the first\
  \ NPCs I ever wrote for Paizo. Looking back, I think I’ve grown a lot since, but\
  \ they’re NPCs I’ve still got some fondness for.</p> \n     <p>You can find me around\
  \ the internet on Twitter talking about my cat (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/madpierrot\"\

  \     <br> \n     <h3>Jeremy Corff </h3> \n     <p>Hello! I’m Jeremy, and I was\
  \ thrilled to write Haigen Topkick for the <em>Absalom, City of Lost Omens</em>\
  \ book. The Puddles has always been a great adventure location in Absalom, and I\
  \ couldn’t pass up a chance to contribute to that dangerous local. I hope ol’ Haigen\
  \ has a chance to make things more complicated for anybody who ventures into the\
  \ water-logged district he calls home.</p> \n     <p>If you’d like to find out more\
  \ about other projects I’ve worked on, you can find me on Twitter at <a href=\"\
  https://twitter.com/Belabras\">@Belabras</a> or at my Starfinder blog <a href=\"\

  \ homebrew Starfinder content. You can also find my work in my Starfinder adventure\
  \ “Added Value,” in several Legendary Games publications, <em>Wayfinders</em> #16\
  \ through #21, on Starfinder Infinite, and in the upcoming <em>Kingmaker Anniversary\
  \ Edition Companion Guide</em>.</p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Vanessa Hoskins (she/her)</h3>\
  \ \n     <p>Hello everyone! I had the pleasure of writing The Docks and the Wise\
  \ Quarter sections. The Docks is the perfect place to go to wish loved ones a \"\
  bon voyage\" or check on the latest imported wares from Arcadia. There’s also Besmara’\
  s Boardwalk for some carnival games and deep-fried foods, or The Mithril Chef for\
  \ a fine dining experience where Chef Claudette Butterfoot creates masterpieces\
  \ out of rare, and sometimes dangerous, ingredients. <br> If you want to get cozy\
  \ with a book at a tea house, or study for your Conjuration final, or engage in\
  \ book-smuggling, then the Wise Quarter is the place for you. As one of the sleepier\
  \ parts of Absalom, it’s perfect for students, scholars, and library enthusiasts.\
  \ Just watch your coin purse, because the Learned Guard cares more if you paid your\
  \ silver letters than if someone took your coin purse. What are \"silver letters\"\
  \ you ask? Read the book!</p> \n     <p>Once you’ve done that, read <a href=\"https://www.pathfinderinfinite.com/product/373835/Vellum--Lace-Ep-00-Moving-Day?affiliate_id=3272729\"\
  ><em>Vellum &amp; Lace</em></a>, a work of serialized fiction on Pathfinder Infinite\
  \ that takes place in the City at the Center of the World and explores all sorts\
  \ of exciting locales.</p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>James Jacobs</h3> \n     <p>A\
  \ book about Absalom was one of the first things we published ages ago, and since\
  \ then most of the development for the city has happened organically across all\
  \ sorts of products—but mostly through Organized Play. A big part of what I worked\
  \ on in this book gets categorized under the “Help Erik create text for the connective\
  \ tissue” once we got started with the first (and smaller) incarnation of this book.\
  \ There was a lot of connective tissue to create, but my focus was mostly on NPCs\
  \ and additional locations and sidebar content. Looking back on it all, though,\
  \ I think the part I enjoyed the most (and I hope folks like it as well!) was writing\
  \ the various songs that you’ll see in some of the sidebars. It was tough to not\
  \ go on for pages once I got going on one of them! </p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Virginia\
  \ Jordan</h3> \n     <p>Virginia is a life-long PNW resident who loves nothing more\
  \ than beekeeping, memes about dogs, and completely useless facts about Medieval\
  \ history. Having worked at Paizo for two years, their time there only fostered\
  \ their love of fantasy roleplaying games. Their favorite Pathfinder subjects to\
  \ write about are diseases and fae creatures, and the weirder the subject matter,\
  \ the better. In their free time, they enjoy LARPing and creating props and costumes.\
  \ They are also a professional photographer with a focus on non-traditional portraiture.\
  \ You can find their work at <a href=\"https://jordanimages.com/\">JordanImages.com</a></p>\
  \ \n     <br> \n     <h3>Matt Morris</h3> \n     <p>I’m Matt Morris, and I’ve been\
  \ lucky enough to do freelance writing for Pathfinder and Starfinder for several\
  \ years now, working with Paizo and a few 3rd-party companies, including <a href=\"\
  http://everybodygames.net/\">Everybody Games</a> and <a href=\"https://www.roguegeniusgames.com/\"\
  >Rogue Genius Games</a>.</p> \n     <p>The Lost Omens line for Pathfinder Second\
  \ Edition has given me the opportunity to explore some of my favorite parts of the\
  \ setting in the <em>Lost Omens Character Guide</em>, <em>Lost Omens: Gods &amp;\
  \ Magic</em>, <em>Lost Omens: Legends</em>, and <em>Lost Omens: The Grand Bazaar</em>.\
  \ Now I’m excited to be contributing to the description of the Coins, Absalom’s\
  \ bustling commercial district.</p> \n     <p>I keep an up-to-date list of my work\
  \ on my Paizo profile, and I’m always looking for interesting projects, so feel\
  \ free to <a href=\"https://mattmorris.carrd.co/\">contact me</a> if you are looking\
  \ for a reliable writer!</p> \n     <p>When not writing, I’m teaching high school\
  \ English near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.</p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Mikhail Rekun</h3>\
  \ \n     <p>Уважаемые читатели, дожили! I’m Mikhail Sergeyevich Rekun, and you may\
  \ recall me from past Lost Omens such as <em>Legends</em> (Baba Yaga, Eutropia)\
  \ and <em>Mwangi Expanse</em> (Mbe’ke, gnolls, Mwangi Jungle, Terwa Uplands). When\
  \ not writing for Paizo, I’m a Russian-American historian, educator, and author.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>I wrote for Absalom fairly early in my freelancing career, and it was\
  \ until very recently my largest project by far. I wrote the Shadow War section,\
  \ the Petal District, and several of the NPCs, including Dyrianna, Lady Adrielle,\
  \ Lord Kerkis, Lord Avid, and my personal favorite, Samel Maleagant of the Court\
  \ of Black Paper (last seen snooping around Eutropia in <em>Lost Omens Legends</em>).\
  \ Looking back, I’m still quite proud of the things that I wrote, particularly the\
  \ Court of Black Paper (an exceedingly heterodox Norgorberite cult) and the contours\
  \ of the Shadow War at large (a political struggle with genuine issues that make\
  \ for some very strange bedfellows).</p> \n     <p>I should mention that I am also\
  \ working these days on a different sort of city book, <em>Ourichor: Fulcrum of\
  \ the Luminant Age</em>, a rather stranger sort of city spread across seven ancient\
  \ derricks in a world recovering from the Cold Darkness. Check it out at <a href=\"\
  https://twitter.com/LuminantA\">https://twitter.com/LuminantA</a>!</p> \n     <br>\
  \ \n     <h3>David N. Ross</h3> \n     <p>I'm delighted to bring you much of the\
  \ chapters on Absalom’s ancient and magical keeps and the military organizations\
  \ that run them. I have a special place in my heart for the Starwatch and all sorts\
  \ of spycraft. Since I can never get enough politics and intrigue, my next big project\
  \ is a Pathfinder first edition sourcebook with rules supporting that kind of play.\
  \ It’s called <em>Spheres of Guile</em> from Drop Dead Studios, and it's now <a\
  \ href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/adammeyers/spheres-of-guile-and-ultimate-engineering\"\
  >live on Kickstarter</a>! You can also find me on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DavidRossWorlds\"\
  >@DavidRossWorlds</a></p> \n     <br> \n     <h3>Shahreena Shahrani</h3> \n    \
  \ <p>Marhaba! I’m Shahreena Shahrani, a Malaysian-American educator, writer, and\
  \ researcher. I’ve been contributing to the expanding worlds of Pathfinder and Starfinder\
  \ for several years. I can’t tell you how happy I am that this book is finally out!\
  \ </p> \n     <p>My contribution to the licit and illicit! markets and drugs, trademasters,\
  \ and guilds in the Lost Omens line for Pathfinder Second Edition has been inspired\
  \ by the peoples and cultures of the Middle East. From the stimulating qat cultivated\
  \ on the terraced mountains of Sana’a (Yemen); to the historic Khan el-Khalili souq\
  \ in Cairo (Egypt), where merchants and artisans enjoy the thrill of haggling and\
  \ bartering with customers; to the night market at Jemaa el-Fnaa in Marrakesh (Morocco),\
  \ where vendors and their wares appear almost magically with the setting of the\
  \ sun; and the incredible warmth, generosity, and strength of diverse peoples. I\
  \ also named one of the NPCs, Namira, after my cat! </p> \n     <p>When not gaming,\
  \ I teach Arabic and Persian culture courses, and deliver lectures/presentations\
  \ on hot topics to government agencies and personnel. Additionally, I create storytelling\
  \ adapted from world folklore on my YouTube channel. </p> \n     <p>I’m always looking\
  \ for interesting projects, so feel free to email me at shahreena_s@yahoo.com. </p>\
