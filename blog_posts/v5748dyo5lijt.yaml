  \       <br><i>Illustration by Wayne Reynolds</i>\n      </div> \n      <p>Some\
  \ beings—like those from the Outer Planes—are intrinsically virtuous or malevolent;\
  \ however, mortals enjoy the unique characteristic of free will. No humans are born\
  \ evil. They become evil.</p> \n      <p>Like many children in the Nidalese city\
  \ of Ridwan, the girl who would one day be called Zelhara grew up in a massive nursery\
  \ run by the church of Zon-Kuthon. This institution allowed parents to continue\
  \ their work without having to attend to their children's daily needs, and after\
  \ a number of years, once the children could physically contribute to the household,\
  \ they were returned to their families. Agents of Nidal's Umbral Court performed\
  \ numerous tests on the children during their time under the care of the Kuthite\
  \ clergy, selecting certain candidates for the state's and church's future needs.\
  \ Mere weeks before she was to rejoin her family, Zelhara herself was brought before\
  \ an Umbral Court agent who claimed he could see something in her that pleased the\
  \ Midnight Lord. One day she would share his message of pain and duty with thousands\
  \ of fearful inheritors. Her family, loyal Nidalese who worked meager trades in\
  \ the city, found delight in knowing that their child would one day hold high status\
  \ in the state.</p> \n      <p>Zelhara and 12 other children from the nursery began\
  \ their training at a young age. Unlike shadowcallers, Zelhara and her young companions\
  \ didn't undergo the scrutiny of a nightglass, but were instead selected by virtue\
  \ of their mere presence and their reactions to fear and pain. Zelhara proved a\
  \ severe and obedient child, perfect for the role of a state inquisitor.</p> \n\
  \      <p>After their selection, the children in Zelhara's group were moved into\
  \ a wing of dormitories within the temple of Zon-Kuthon. The priests began the children's\
  \ training with religious study and the dark history of their nation. The Kuthites\
  \ taught the children how to identify enemies of the church and state. The members\
  \ of Zelhara's group received the best foods at mealtimes, and as long as they performed\
  \ their required duties and showed the proper respect to their tutors, they were\
  \ allowed relative freedom to do as they pleased. They were even allowed outside\
  \ the temple, and granted the privilege to occasionally spend time with their parents,\
  \ provided they lived within Ridwan. This favorable treatment attracted jealousy\
  \ and animosity from the young shadowcaller initiates and prospective clerics also\
  \ training at the temple. Zelhara's tutors told her that the other children were\
  \ envious because they were too independent and didn't properly understand submission.\
  \ Zelhara believed it was because they knew they might one day have to withstand\
  \ her ministrations.</p> \n      <p>Zelhara's training grew more rigorous as the\
  \ instruction continued. She and her colleagues were encouraged to invent their\
  \ own unique methods of inflicting pain and drawing the truth from their victims.\
  \ Zelhara preferred emotional manipulation and stress positions rather than direct\
  \ pain, for she believed pain to be a form of religious ecstasy that only the truly\
  \ devoted could enjoy. As she subjected dissidents of Nidal to her ministrations,\
  \ she felt strong and grew proud of the service she performed for her nation and\
  \ her god.</p> \n      <p>As Zelhara and her companions matured into their teenage\
  \ years, they moved to their own building in the city near the volcanic rift that\
  \ splits Ridwan's central square, and their training changed significantly. Their\
  \ tutors became more strict and abusive. Zelhara, who had been the standout student\
  \ within her group, started to be treated with suspicion and disdain. She couldn't\
  \ even perform simple tasks in the dormitory kitchens without being scolded and\
  \ punished. She and the others suffered beatings, periods of isolation, and the\
  \ burden of meaningless tasks at all hours of the day. Their old names were stripped\
  \ away and their tutors provided new ones. The Kuthites forced Zelhara and her colleagues\
  \ to torture and humiliate each other as part of their training, yet they still\
  \ gave the students the chance to voluntarily remove themselves from the process\
  \ and return to their families. Surprisingly, none of the children accepted. Despite\
  \ their abuse, they wanted to be useful tools of the state, and while their instructors\
  \ dehumanized them, the children formed bonds with one another, as they had no one\
  \ else to rely upon. During this period, Zelhara grew close to Tornine, a boy she\
  \ had known since her time at the nursery.</p> \n      <p>Finally, Zelhara and the\
  \ others were judged ready to undergo a ritual called the Descent. More to test\
  \ loyalty than to extract admissions of guilt, prospective inquisitors are placed\
  \ in pairs within iron cages, their faces mere inches from each other, and then\
  \ lowered into the rift in the center of Ridwan where the Midnight Lord is said\
  \ to have first manifested upon Golarion. The oppressive heat causes intense pain\
  \ and the cloying smoke makes breathing an ordeal. As the inquisitors are lowered\
  \ into the rift, they must overcome their own suffering and disorientation to force\
  \ their counterparts into absolute submission to their authority. Zelhara found\
  \ herself paired with Tornine, and as the iron cage creaked down into the crevasse,\
  \ they engaged in a battle of wills. Tornine tried to remain strong under Zelhara's\
  \ scrutiny as tears evaporated from his cheeks, but Zelhara was unrelenting. She\
  \ knew her strength was superior. When Tornine began to crumble within minutes of\
  \ hanging over the sulfurous fissure, Zelhara felt utter disgust for her former\
  \ friend and continued to disparage him. She didn't give the signal to raise the\
  \ cage until she knew Tornine had died—just another useless tool to be discarded.\
  \ Having passed the test, Zelhara achieved the rank of full inquisitor, earning\
  \ her family's pride and admiration.</p> \n      <p>As one of Nidal's best and most\
  \ thorough inquisitors and torturers, Zelhara now travels throughout Avistan in\
  \ service to her nation and the Midnight Lord. Zelhara claims that, with enough\
  \ time, she can make anyone divulge what they know—yet she doesn't care for forced\
  \ statements, when people blurt out anything just to make her stop. Zelhara hears\
  \ the real voices of her subjects when they scream in agony, and she can smell the\
  \ truth in the blood that she spills in pursuit of her goals.</p> \n     </blockquote>\
