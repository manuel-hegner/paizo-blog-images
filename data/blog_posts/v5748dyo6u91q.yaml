  \     This encounter is a prequel for the <em>Mechageddon!</em> Adventure Path that\
  \ represents the player characters’ (PCs’) ongoing training after enlisting in the\
  \ New Valor Defense Force. Run this encounter after completing <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6u4ez?Mechageddon-Encounter-Simulation-1\"\
  >Simulation 1: Valko Derby</a>, after the PCs have leveled up and created their\
  \ own mechs (or upgraded the mechs from Simulation 1 to tier 2).</p>\n      <br>\n\
  \      <h3>THE LAST STAND OF KARNATH! — CR 6</h3>\n      <p>After catching Firefight’\
  s notice playing Valko Derby, the PCs were invited to step out of the valkopods\
  \ and become the real huzkars by joining the New Valor Defense Force. NVDF training\
  \ is comprehensive for all recruits, regardless of prior vocation, to prepare them\
  \ for military duties and potential challenges from combat training and mech repair\
  \ to physical fitness and aircraft piloting. All potentially dangerous training\
  \ occurs in simulated environments utilizing some of the galaxy’s best virtual reality\
  \ technology. As a result, NVDF training pods are a familiar sight to every NVDF\
  \ recruit, even if they aren’t offered many chances to train in the simulated valko\
  \ cockpits. But with the placement exam schedule communicated well in advance, the\
  \ prevailing mood is a flux of excitement and anxiety as everyone hopes for the\
  \ chance to prove themselves. Read or paraphrase the following to set the scene.</p>\n\
  \      <blockquote>\n       <p>Commander “Raptor” Wano’s voice issues a disembodied\
  \ message as his training assistant, Lieutenant Bastian-5, helps the recruits into\
  \ individual cockpits in the training center’s testing chamber. “Recruits! Today\
  \ is your placement exam. Do well and you might find yourself in the 3rd battlegroup\
  \ as the 13th, 14th, or even 15th Valko squadron under my command! Thanks to an\
  \ agreement with Storyteller Productions, today’s exam will feature colossi from\
  \ the popular Kaiju Riot holovid series. As you know Lt. Bastian-5 is a huge fan\
  \ of those movies—time to make them proud. Today you get to be the heroes!”</p>\n\

  \ Olivieri</p>\n      </div>\n      <br>\n      <h4>Culture or Profession (Charisma-based)\
  \ (Recall Knowledge)</h4>\n      <p>The <em>Kaiju Riot!</em> series of films is\
  \ well-known on Daimalko and has small cult followings all over the galaxy. NVDF\
  \ recruits have likely seen one or more of the films and that film knowledge could\
  \ help them in the upcoming simulation. For more benefits of watching these films,\
  \ see <strong>Trivial Knowledge</strong>, below.</p>\n      <p><strong>10+:</strong>\
  \ The <em>Kaiju Riot!</em> series follows the often-terrible exploits of a lone\
  \ colossus, Gadrakor. In early films, Gadrakor brutally destroyed several Daimalkan\
  \ settlements. Critics applaud these early films for teaching the benefits of environmentalism\
  \ through cinematic media. Eventually, Gadrakor became a hero, defending Daimalko\
  \ against unspeakable horrors.</p>\n      <p><strong>15+:</strong> Pop star Jollys\
  \ Vass got her start with the hit <em>Don’t Fall</em>, a ballad written from the\
  \ perspective of two damai lovers who were separated during Gadrakor’s rampage in\
  \ <em>Kaiju Riot! 1</em>. In that film, Gadrakor’s characteristics were based on\
  \ questionable information about an illusive colossus called a drakogor. In the\
  \ years since, groundbreaking field research about real drakogors has provided new\
  \ material for the sequels.</p>\n      <p><strong>20+: </strong>In <em>Kaiju Riot!\
  \ 3: The Doom from Beyond,</em> Gadrakor teams up with a nearly invulnerable mechanical\
  \ version of himself from the previous film, Mechagadrakor, to face a demonic version\
  \ of himself, the space emperor colossus King Gadrakor.</p>\n      <p><strong>25+:</strong>\
  \ Gadrakor and his iterations have all the same abilities as a real drakogor: they\
  \ can absorb energy attacks to power their breath weapons, which deal sonic damage,\
  \ and have a hardened mantle that adds to their natural armor. Encourage the PCs\
  \ to swap out their simulated mechs’ weapons to avoid giving the enemy an advantage.</p>\n\
  \      <h4>The Mission</h4>\n      <p>The PCs’ simulated mechs begin in the center\
  \ of Karnath, an ancient Daimalkan city lost to colossi attacks long ago. The simulation\
  \ completes almost instantly, finalizing the holographic details of a breezy spring\
  \ afternoon with streets empty except for the PCs. A Daimalkan orb rests in a hollow\
  \ built into the bronze statue the PCs’ mechs are positioned around. Four wide streets\
  \ wind in all four cardinal directions leading away from the monument. Tall office\
  \ buildings and empty residences line each block except for the planetary transit\
  \ landing pad northwest of the PCs.</p>\n      <p>When the PCs are ready to begin,\
  \ Commander Wano’s voice gives the final orders before the simulation begins. “\
  The Gadrakors have only one goal: Destroy the orb. To pass this exam, you only have\
  \ to stop them. Defeat all your enemies and protect the orb. Good luck, recruits.”\
  </p>\n      <p><strong>PCs and Mechs:</strong> This encounter is designed for four\
  \ level 2 PCs. As part of their ongoing training at the NVDF Academy, the PCs have\
  \ been learning the ins and outs of various mech configurations to better prepare\
  \ them to their assignments as huzkars in the new modular Apex valkos, or as support\
  \ crew for others who are assigned that role. As a result, players should create\
  \ Tier 2 mechs for their PCs using the rules in <em>Starfinder Tech Revolution</em>.</p>\n\
  \      <p><strong>Map:</strong> This simulation uses the monument side of <em>Starfinder\
  \ Flip-Mat: Metropolis.</em> The PC’s mechs begin the encounter huddled in the middle\
  \ of the map around the monument. 1 square represents 10 feet of terrain.</p>\n\
  \      <p><strong>Trivial Knowledge:</strong> Watching the <em>Kaiju Riot! </em>film\
  \ series has given the PCs prior knowledge of their opponents’ capabilities. The\
  \ PCs can attempt the normal Recall Knowledge checks to identify their foes’ abilities\
  \ prior to the beginning of the encounter. They may attempt these checks using Culture\
  \ or an appropriate Profession skill instead, using the same DCs.</p>\n      <p><strong>Creatures</strong>:\
  \ The three holographic colossi the PCs face are inspired by the popular holovid,\
  \ <em>Kaiju Riot 3: The Doom from Beyond</em>. The three kaiju begin the encounter\
  \ near the edges of the map and have a single goal in mind: destroy the orb at the\
  \ center of the monument the PCs are protecting. The colossi act well as a team,\
  \ contrary to their adversarial roles in <em>Kaiju Riot 3</em>. King Gadrakor relies\
  \ on its roar and fearsome presence to throw the PCs off, while Gadrakor tries to\
  \ draw them away from the monument or take them out with its breath weapon. Mechagadrakor\
  \ is the key to their strategy. If nobody attacks Mechagadrakor, it moves adjacent\
  \ to the monument and spends the next two turns attacking the orb. The other two\
  \ eventually attempt the same tactic until the PCs target them with attacks. All\
  \ three colossi fight until they are destroyed.</p>\n      <br>\n      <p><strong>Gadrakor\

  \ The orb has 100 Hit Points. If it takes enough damage to reduce it to 0 or below,\
  \ the orb is destroyed and the simulation ends in failure. If the PCs manage to\
  \ defeat their foes, the simulation ends in victory the moment the last Gadrakor\

  \ to play.</p>\n      <br>\n      <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>\n      <p>If the PCs successfully\
  \ protect the orb, when the simulation ends they are formally offered spots in the\
  \ NVDF’s 3<sup>rd</sup> Battlegroup as huzkar recruits. The next step in their training\
  \ will be piloting brand new Apex mechs! If the simulation ends in failure, the\
  \ PCs can enter remedial training before attempting the placement exam again, or\
  \ accept positions in Valko Support, Infantry, Tank command groups, or even as Skywatch\
  \ air support pilots. At this point, the group is ready to level up once more and\
  \ begin their <em>Mechageddon! </em>campaign.</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
