  ><em>Pathfinder Monster Core</em></a> is drawing nearer! On March 27, prepare to\
  \ get raided by everything from aeons to zombies! This is the third of the core\
  \ books for the Pathfinder Second Edition Remaster Project. It compiles monsters\
  \ from the <em>Bestiary</em> series along with some choice cuts from other books\
  \ and some brand-new creatures.</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a\

  \      </div>\n      <br>\n      <h2>Design Goals</h2>\n      <p>Overall, monsters\
  \ were working well statistically and thematically, so there weren’t any changes\
  \ to the basics of how monsters work. Instead, we focused on making the book gorgeous,\
  \ expansive, and full of great monsters! We had several big goals for <em>Monster\
  \ Core</em>.</p>\n      <p><strong>Match the Remaster Rules:</strong> We adjusted\
  \ monster rules that needed to match new terminology or rules. For instance, changing\
  \ “negative healing” to “void healing,” using “Reactive Strike,” and swapping out\
  \ spells that were in <em>Core Rulebook</em>, but not <em>Player Core</em>.</p>\n\
  \      <p><strong>Collect the Greatest Hits:</strong> The most classic monsters\
  \ mingle with new creations! This book is focused on creatures that you can use\
  \ over and over in all sorts of games. Most creatures came over from the first <em>Bestiary</em>,\
  \ with some updates. But we also graduated some monsters that appeared in <em>Bestiary\
  \ 2</em> and <em>Bestiary 3</em> to the main monster book, including serpentfolk,\
  \ herexens, marsh and shadow giants, phantoms, scarecrows, and more! Monster Core\
  \ also brings several Pathfinder First Edition monsters into Second Edition, including\
  \ bogwids and the sargassum heap (formerly sargassum fiend).</p>\n      <p><strong>Replace\
  \ Some OGL Monsters:</strong> We cut several creatures that we were using from the\
  \ OGL as we move to the ORC license and a set of creatures more specific to Pathfinder\
  \ and Golarion. Where possible, we put in creatures that fill a similar role in\
  \ adventure-building. For example, the sargassum heap mentioned above replaces another\
  \ lurking 6th-level plant creature! We’ve also created exciting new devils, dragons,\
  \ and other new threats in classic categories.</p>\n      <p><strong>Match the Mythology:</strong>\
  \ For a great many creatures that originated in folklore, their abilities and look\
  \ were based on sources like pulp novels and TV shows. Eleanor Ferron spearheaded\
  \ an effort to take creatures like rakshasa, oni, dragon turtles, and coatls closer\
  \ to their source material. Making them more authentic while ensuring they still\
  \ match Golarion’s lore was a massive undertaking!</p>\n      <p><strong>Pack it\
  \ Full!:</strong> Lastly, we wanted to include as many monsters as we could reasonably\
  \ fit. Variety makes for memorable campaigns, adventures, and encounters, so getting\
  \ more monsters in the book was great. The book is longer than the first <em>Bestiary,</em>\
  \ but beyond that, we fit more stat blocks into several sections—dinosaurs have\
  \ the same number of pages, but 10 creatures instead of seven.</p>\n      <p>There\
  \ were also some changes that weren’t primary goals. Low-level monsters had high\
  \ AC too often, and Michael Sayre did a pass to make the low-level experience more\
  \ even. There wasn’t a level –1 plant or fungus for <em>summon plant or fungus</em>,\
  \ so Landon Winkler made the sprigjack, a weaker twigjack.</p>\n      <br>\n   \
  \   <h2>Wrap Battle</h2>\n      <p>On streams and other previews, we’ve talked quite\
  \ a bit about hags, devils, and other monsters that had pretty big revisions. Let’\
  s take a moment to go over an example of a smaller change. Mummies, beyond being\
  \ classic horror monsters, make for great undead to include in musty tombs and dungeons.\
  \ But the <em>Bestiary</em> version was primarily based on causing despair and imposing\
  \ a rotting curse. They can be pretty static, so we were looking for something new\
  \ to put into our basic mummies to make them more interesting, much like we reassessed\
  \ them when creating new mummies for <em>Book of the Dead</em>.</p>\n      <p>Since\
  \ the mummy guardian and mummy pharaoh were originally created with sophisticated\
  \ chemical processes, we landed on an alchemical theme. You can see the special\
  \ actions the mummy guardian can now use in combat, and how they reinforce the creature’\
  s theme in a unique way!</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"\

  \ poison, unconscious; <strong>Weaknesses</strong> alchemical 5 (see alchemical\
  \ weakness), fire 5</p>\n      <p><strong>Alchemical Weakness</strong> The guardian’\
  s weakness to alchemical items not only applies to damage from alchemical items,\
  \ but the guardian also takes 5 damage when splashed with non-damaging alchemical\
  \ items or dosed with alchemical poisons, even if they’re immune to their other\
  \ effects.</p>\n      <p><strong>Blighted Consumption</strong> [reaction] (curse,\
  \ divine, poison) <strong>Trigger</strong> A creature within 30 feet eats or drinks\
  \ (including an alchemical item or potion); <strong>Effect</strong> The food or\
  \ drink burns like the caustic substances fed to the mummy before its death. If\
  \ the creature fails a DC 24 Fortitude save, they become sickened 2 after they finish\
  \ the consumption and can’t reduce their sickened condition while within 30 feet\
  \ of any mummy.</p>\n      <p><strong>Speed</strong> 20 feet</p>\n      <p><strong>Melee</strong>\
  \ [one-action] fist +16 (agile), <strong>Damage</strong> 2d10+7 bludgeoning plus\
  \ Choking Pain</p>\n      <p><strong>Choking Pain</strong> [one-action] (divine,\
  \ illusion, mental, void) <strong>Requirements</strong> The mummy’s last action\
  \ was a successful fist Strike; <strong>Effect</strong>The mummy shares the pain\
  \ of its dying moments with the target of that Strike. That creature takes 3d8 void\
  \ damage with a DC 24 basic Will save. If the creature critically fails the saving\
  \ throw, it can’t speak for 1 round, including to Cast a Spell.</p>\n      <br>\n\
