  \ \n     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">She heard them before\
  \ she saw them.</p> \n      <p>“...Bones be cracked, flesh be stewed\"</p> \n  \
  \    <p>“We be goblins! You be food!”</p> \n      <p>Shalelu’s lip curled in a half-conscious\
  \ snarl at the song. She crept closer, slipping from the forest to a knot of gnarled\
  \ old pear trees that the farmer, or more likely the farmer’s great-grandparents,\
  \ had planted by the house. Under the tangled branches, heavy with ripe fall fruit,\
  \ she peered at the singing goblins.</p> \n      <p>The barn was already burning.\
  \ Judging by the height of the flames leaping from its blackened roof, the farmers\
  \ must have brought in the fall hay, and it was now blazing merrily behind a ring\
  \ of dancing goblins. At least there weren’t any screams. Any animals in the barn\
  \ either had escaped, or were already dead.</p> \n      <p>The fire’s grip was closing\
  \ around the farmhouse, too. Burning arrows studded the roof. The eaves were smoldering,\
  \ the wooden shingles beginning to glow from beneath like a red dragon’s scales—\
  and even as Shalelu tried to assess how much longer the house had, she saw the curtains\
  \ twitch before an upstairs window. The brief round shape of a face peeked out through\
  \ the glass. It vanished almost as soon as it appeared, but it was enough to tell\
  \ Shalelu that someone was inside.</p> \n      <p>Well, that tore it. Not that she\
  \ needed much of a push where goblins were concerned.</p> \n      <p>Smoothly, with\
  \ the ease of long practice, Shalelu broke from the trees and shot the first goblin.\
  \ Even before her first arrow hit, she had another flying. Two goblins fell, one\
  \ clutching at an arrow in his red-gurgling throat, the other with a feathered shaft\
  \ sprouting from her eye.</p> \n      <p>She shot a third before the rest reacted.\
  \ As the third goblin fell, his screech cut off by the arrow bisecting his windpipe,\
  \ the survivors spotted the elf. A frozen instant passed between them. Shalelu felt\
  \ a flashed hope that the goblins’ cowardice might drive them to flee, even though\
  \ she stood alone—but no. Their wavering morale caught and steadied as the biggest\
  \ goblin leaped toward her, brandishing a rickety but sharp-edged dogslicer.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>“Brave, brave warriors! Warriors of the Mosswood! Kill this elf! Kill\
  \ her!” the big goblin howled. As a battlefield speech, Shalelu felt it was uninspired,\
  \ but whatever it lacked in creativity, it made up in volume. Certainly the goblins\
  \ seemed to think it did the trick, because they all came rushing at her in a shrieking,\
  \ knee-high mob of red eyes, needle teeth, and swinging dogslicers, simultaneously\
  \ absurd and deadly earnest.</p> \n      <p>The shouting champion at the head of\
  \ the mob was the most ridiculous of them all. She wore a decapitated toy horse’\
  s head impaled on her spiked helm, with puffs of woolly stuffing flapping around\
  \ her enormous ears. Her cloak was as green and moldy as any other Mosswood goblin’\
  s, but she’d trimmed it with dogs’ tails: poodles’ dirt-stained pompoms, curly blond\
  \ spaniels’ plumes, a mastiff’s grizzled stub. Another tail hung from the pommel\
  \ of her dogslicer.</p> \n      <p>It would have been a mistake to dismiss the goblin\
  \ as a joke, though. People died for such mistakes. That toy horse’s neck was smeared\
  \ with real blood; those tails had been collected from real dogs, and some of them\
  \ looked like they’d been big and fierce. The grisly kneecaps that served as the\
  \ goblin’s pauldrons were real flesh and bone, and from their ragged edges had probably\
  \ been chewed off human legs. Maybe live ones.</p> \n      <p>That was the danger\
  \ with goblins, Shalelu thought. You laughed at them, thinking they were stupid\
  \ and big-headed and preposterous, and then they slashed your ankles and pulled\
  \ you down and cut your throat before you realized that they were, actually, serious\
  \ as murder.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/021820_Runelords.png\"\

  \ \n      </div> \n      <p>She wondered whether someone had made that mistake with\
  \ these goblins. They’d been in a fight recently. Several were limping or favoring\
  \ wounded sides and limbs. One looked like he’d narrowly dodged a spell; a burn\
  \ scar streaked black across his forehead. But the goblins had survived, which meant\
  \ maybe whoever they’d fought hadn’t.</p> \n      <p>A small mystery. If she survived,\
  \ maybe she’d try to solve it.</p> \n      <p>First she had to survive.</p> \n \
  \     <p>Shalelu aimed past the charging champion and shot two more goblins, wounding\
  \ the first and felling the second. Then the champion was on her, and Shalelu had\
  \ to skitter back, slinging her bow behind a shoulder and drawing her shortsword.\
  \ She feinted and retreated back toward the farmhouse. The fire was spreading, and\
  \ she didn’t have long to save whoever was in there.</p> \n      <p>“Uruvuu Kneebiter\
  \ will wear your head!” the big goblin crooned at Shalelu, sweeping her dogslicer\
  \ low.</p> \n      <p>“Uru-who?” Shalelu snorted, straining to sound nonchalant.\
  \ That goblin was faster than she liked. “Do you fancy yourself one of the big heroes?\
  \ Should Vorka and Ripnugget cower and whine at your name?”</p> \n      <p>“They\
  \ will!” Uruvuu hissed, and leaped.</p> \n      <p>The elf kicked at the goblin,\
  \ but to her astonishment, Uruvuu jumped over the kick, grabbed her leg, and bit\
  \ her, sinking her filthy teeth into Shalelu’s leg just above the knee.</p> \n \
  \     <p>“Get off!” Shalelu slashed down at the goblin, hacking one of Uruvuu’s\
  \ grisly pauldrons in two and cutting a deep gash into the champion’s shoulder.\
  \ Uruvuu just lifted her head and grinned up horribly, her teeth dripping red.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>“I’ll eat you,” the goblin snarled, and bit Shalelu again.</p> \n \
  \     <p>Shalelu swore furiously. She couldn’t get Uruvuu off her leg. If it had\
  \ just been the one goblin, Shalelu could have made short work of her — but there\
  \ were far too many of them, almost a dozen, and not just Mosswood, either. She\
  \ spotted warty Licktoad goblins and tattooed, reed-wearing Brinestumps, and wondered:\
  \ what are they all doing together? The tribes did not easily ally.</p> \n     \
  \ <p>But the question seemed to float far away, untethered to the violence on the\
  \ ground. Shalelu was losing too much blood, maybe going into shock. She slashed\
  \ at a leering goblin and ripped his abdomen open, spilling his guts wetly into\
  \ the barn’s blowing ashes, but still there were too many, and still Uruvuu was\
  \ gnawing at her knee. Is this how it ends?</p> \n      <p>Overhead, the farmhouse\
  \ window slammed open. Strange pale leaves floated down. No, not leaves, Shalelu\
  \ realized, even as she cut another goblin’s throat so savagely that its head flopped\
  \ backwards, limply, over the gouting stump of its neck. They were pages. She recognized\
  \ the illustrations.</p> \n      <p>Pages from Erastil’s <i>Book of Common Prayer</i>,\
  \ ripped out by the handful. Someone had drawn crude goblin faces in thick, sweeping\
  \ strokes over each one. The ink was still wet enough that the faces stuck lightly\
  \ together when they kissed.</p> \n      <p>But they drifted apart, falling, and\
  \ when they came down over the fight, the goblins broke apart in total pandemonium.\
  \ “The words! Words! Stolen out of our heads! You see them! Take them back! The\
  \ cursed words! Burn them!”</p> \n      <p>Frantically the goblins grabbed at the\
  \ ink-smeared pages, thrusting them into the barn’s blaze. They forgot about Shalelu\
  \ entirely, each one vying to grab and burn pages of precious, stolen words. Even\
  \ Uruvuu shrieked in terror, blood bubbling through her teeth as she elbowed her\
  \ kin aside to snatch up her own pages.</p> \n      <p>Shalelu cut down another\
  \ two goblins in the confusion. Then the rest, realizing that they were outnumbered—\
  or, at least, were now facing Shalelu with odds no better than six to one, which\
  \ seemed to count as “outnumbered” to them—fled, screaming, from the bloodied elf\
  \ and the still-falling rain of pages around her.</p> \n      <p>“Thanks,” Shalelu\
  \ called up to whoever was in the farmhouse. Her leg felt like murder. She pressed\
  \ a wooden wand against the wound, gritting her teeth until the magic flowed forth\
  \ to heal her. Then, testing her weight gingerly, she looked up to the window. Already\
  \ she could hear the goblins shouting and arguing as they tried to regroup in the\
  \ wood, and see the red reach of flames spreading across the roof. “You’d better\
  \ come out. We need to get to Sandpoint before they come back.”</p> \n      <p>More\
  \ than safety, Shalelu wanted answers. This attack was unusual. Fractious rival\
  \ tribes allied and attacking humans far outside their normal territory. Champions\
  \ striving to make new legends for themselves. She’d been hunting the local goblins\
  \ for years, and she’d never seen them cooperate like this.</p> \n      <p>Something\
  \ strange was afoot. And whatever it was, this was just the beginning.</p> \n  \

  \ \n     <p><a href=\"https://paizo.com/riseOfTheRunelords\">Rise of the Runelords</a>\
  \ was the very first Pathfinder Adventure Path, and its legacy—be it the cruel comedy\
  \ of goblins and ogres, the iconic seaside town of Sandpoint, or the sinister presence\
  \ of the Runelords themselves—can be felt to this very day. Rise of the Runelords\
  \ was the first Pathfinder Adventure Path to be compiled into a single hardcover\
  \ volume, and later this year it will be the first Adventure Path to join the ranks\
  \ of the Pathfinder pocket editions! Rise of the Runelords has never been more affordable!</p>\
