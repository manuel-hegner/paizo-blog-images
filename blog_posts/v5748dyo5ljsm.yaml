  /paizocon\">PaizoCon</a>, which starts in a little over 2 weeks. The office is abuzz\
  \ with final preparations as all of our departments pull together to bring this\
  \ convention to our fans. Schedules posted on paizo.com last week and the signups\
  \ are ongoing. Hurry and make your selections, as tomorrow is Lottery Day, how exciting!\
  \ Some of the games on offer:</p> \n    <ul>\n     <li>Sewer Dragons of Absalom—\
  an Adventure Card Game adaptation where you play kobolds using pregenerated character\
  \ decks. Brought to you by David Jacobson and Tyler Beck.</li> \n     <li>Skeleton\
  \ Moon—a retired Pathfinder Society Season 0 scenario ran by the Master of the Dark\
  \ Stephen Radney-McFarland.</li> \n     <li>Out of Retirement—a to be named Season\
  \ 0 retired scenario hosted by Pathfinder Society developer Linda Zayas-Palmer.</li>\
  \ \n     <li>Season 0 Reborn—Lead developer John Compton offers players the chance\
  \ to chose which of the retired Season 0 adventures they would like him to run,\
  \ but no matter the choice all will be challenge filled at his hands.</li>\n   \
  \ </ul> \n    <p>Besides the lottery games, the Grand Ballroom will once again ring\
  \ with the sounds of all things organized play. We have tables of Adventure Card\
  \ Guild, including some demonstrations of the Mummy's Mask Base Set, occurring in\
  \ the morning and evening slots. Players may check out a base set for use during\
  \ the afternoon slot, so you can play Adventure Card Game all day long!</p> \n \
  \   <p>Mid-Season 8 adventures are the Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild offerings,\
  \ as well as tables of some of the replayable scenarios such as PFS 5-08: The Confirmation,\
  \ PFS 6-10: The Wounded Wisp, and PFS 7-10: The Consortium Compact. Sunday evening\
  \ sees the world premier of the new multi-table modular special PFS 8-99: The Solstice\
  \ Scar. There are also non-Paizo hosted Pathfinder Society games available in the\
  \ middle slot. The quest series \"Honor's Echo\" will run during the hours the Grand\
  \ Ballroom is open for games, for players wanting to learn about Pathfinder Society\
  \ or play shorter, 1-hour adventures.</p> \n    <p>For the mid-day slot, we close\
  \ the doors on the Grand Ballroom so that attendees have the ability to attend our\
  \ numerous panels. Want to know more about building Starfinder aliens? You're in\
  \ luck! Have a question for the Paizo designers? We have that covered too! As well\
  \ as panels on planning organized play, how comics can make you a better GM, using\
  \ props in your games, and a myriad of other topics.</p> \n    <p>Finally, back\
  \ by popular demand is Quiz Night hosted by John Compton. Join us in the Grand Ballroom\
  \ on Saturday after the banquet to test your knowledge and see if you can rise victorious.\
  \ This is a team-based competition, so gather some friends and join us!</p> \n \
  \   <p>Also returning this year is the Pathfinder Society scavenger hunt. A sheet\
  \ should be in your welcome packet, otherwise stop by the Grand Ballroom and pick\
  \ one up from the headquarters table. Collect signatures while you meet and greet\
  \ people at the convention and unlock a reward for your Pathfinder Society character.</p>\
  \ \n    <h2>Ohio Pathfinder Society Looking for Origins Volunteers!</h2> \n    <p>Venture\
  \ Captain Michael McNerney is looking for a few individuals to fill some slots at\
  \ the upcoming Origins Game Faire in Columbus, Ohio, from June 14 to 19. Interested\
  \ volunteers should sign up using the following links: <a href=\"http://ohiopfs.org/origins/origins-gm-application/\"\

  \ target=\"_blank\">Card Guild Organizer</a> or by sending VC Mike an email at <a\
  \ href=\"mailto:ohiopfs@gmail.com\">ohiopfs@gmail.com.</a></p> \n    <p>That wraps\
  \ up my PaizoCon summary. I'm off to print boons, pack up supplies, and shift focus\
  \ to Gen Con tasks. Next week, I'll return with a peek into the Gen Con offerings,\
  \ including a hint of the upcoming Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild Season 9.</p>\
