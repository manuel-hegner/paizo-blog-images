  >Ultimate Equipment</a></em> are out, so Hayato and Reiko are available as playable\
  \ characters, I'm finally ready to proudly present my latest longtime project: Emerald\
  \ Legacy, a new homebrew Adventure Path for <a href=\"/store/pathfinder/adventureCardGame/adventures/skullAndShackles\"\
  >Skull &amp; Shackles</a>!</p>\n             <p>Before we get into specifics, let's\
  \ start with a short rundown of the setting. In the prologue, you start in Absalom\
  \ and are hired as mercenaries by the Tian noble Hiro Yamashi to join his expedition\
  \ to the Shackles, where his brother Masao has fled after stealing a family heirloom.\
  \ In order to get the heirloom back, you'll chase Masao and his henchmen through\
  \ several exotic locations, discovering his plans along the way. Once you find out\
  \ what he's up to, will you be able to stop him in time? I certainly hope so!</p>\n\
  \             <p>When I started this project, I first looked back on all the experience\
  \ I gathered while working on my first homebrew AP <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo5lk5g?Homebrew-Special-Revenge-of-the-Wicked\"\
  >Revenge of the Wicked</a>. While I'm very happy with how RotW turned out, I have\
  \ to admit that setting up the box is rather complicated, so I wanted to improve\
  \ on this aspect in Emerald Legacy. At the same time, I wanted to change a lot of\
  \ things to give the set my own spin and try out some new ideas.</p>\n         \
  \    <p>The one thing from RotW I was absolutely sure that I wanted to keep was\
  \ the great appearance of the cards made by Ludwig Orsingher, and so I asked him\
  \ to help me out with this project again. Luckily, he agreed, and he made both the\
  \ awesome logo as well as the great realizations of all the custom cards for Emerald\
  \ Legacy, a contribution for which I want to express my deep gratitude.</p>\n  \
  \           <p>With that said, let's have a look at what Emerald Legacy has in store\
  \ for you!</p>\n             <h2>Your ship is your upgradeable base of operations.</h2>\n\
  \             <p>I like it when RPGs give you the option to have your own upgradeable\
  \ base—a place for your heroes to return to between adventures. In the RPG version\
  \ of Skull &amp; Shackles, you can earn your own island; it's also a central mechanic\
  \ in the popular Kingmaker AP. For Emerald Legacy, I decided early on that I wanted\
  \ a base to be important both in the narrative as well as mechanically. My solution\
  \ for this was to make the <em>Shirofune</em>, an upgradeable ship that grows alongside\
  \ you during the course of the AP. (You might think that the concept of a floating\
  \ fortress is a fantasy trope, but warships like these were <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atakebune\"\
  >actually used in Japan during the 16th and 17th century</a>.)</p>\n           \

  \ was done by myself, and is not covered by the <a href=\"/community/communityuse\"\
  >Paizo Community Use Policy</a></em>. \n              <p></p>\n             </div>\n\
  \             <p>My idea was to set up the <em>Shirofune</em> much like a character.\
  \ Instead of skills, though, there are ship facilities, which produce cards from\
  \ an upgrade box you can customize yourself with 3 class decks, another AP, or Skull\
  \ &amp; Shackles itself. This allows you to give the set a distinct flavor by adding\
  \ your favorite expansions. (The <em><a href=\"/products/btpy9hvy?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Monk-Class-Deck\"\
  >Monk Class Deck</a></em> and the Ultimate Combat and Ultimate Equipment decks make\
  \ excellent candidates for a Tian theme.) From a narrative point of view, your choice\
  \ of upgrade box corresponds to the people that were hired to work on the ship.</p>\n\
  \             <p>And instead of a cards list, there's a list of cargo that you get\
  \ to add as plunder to your ship at the beginning of each scenario! These cards\
  \ can be used as an income for boons, as payment for the cards from the upgrade\
  \ box, or to use the ship card's power (discussed below).</p>\n             <h2>You'll\
  \ never walk alone.</h2>\n             <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n           \

  \ by yourself.</em>\n              <p></p>\n             </div>\n             <p>While\
  \ your party plays an essential role in the story of Emerald Legacy, you're not\
  \ the only ones working toward your goal of stopping Hiro's brother Masao. Important\
  \ NPCs will regularly help you out as cohorts, and when everything else fails, you\
  \ can resort to calling the Order of the Raging Wave to help you out! This seafaring\
  \ monk order has travelled with Hiro from Tian Xia to support him on his quest,\
  \ and their leader Umiko Sensei acts as your mentor during the journey.</p>\n  \
  \           <p>In exchange for a little donation in the form of a plunder card,\
  \ they will temporarily replace your role card, gladly taking care of your problems\
  \ for you. This role card is the third step of turning your ship into a character\
  \ by having its crew earn power feats. Over the course of the AP, you can have them\
  \ learn all kinds of useful tricks to cover the weaknesses of your party. You could\
  \ very well play through Emerald Legacy with 1d4 in Wisdom without the need to despair\
  \ at the first sight of the infamous Siren Caller!</p>\n             <h2><b>You\
  \ have rivals, and there are sidequests connected to them.</b></h2>\n          \
  \   <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n              <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180720-KazetheRuthless.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n              <br><em>Instead of pirates vs. ninjas, it will be you vs. pirates\
  \ AND ninjas!</em>\n              <p></p>\n             </div>\n             <p>For\
  \ this AP, I thought it would be cool to fight against a rivaling party with opposing\
  \ goals. While you are fighting on Hiro's side, his brother Masao has a band of\
  \ loyal followers that you will meet several times throughout your journey. To keep\
  \ them fresh and relevant, I made them veterans and introduced villain feats, which\
  \ grant them additional powers over time. Since you get to choose those powers,\
  \ you can start with the least disruptive powers for your party, but you will eventually\
  \ be forced to make what I hope to be hard choices. Additionally, each villain has\
  \ a theme that will influence the rules of the scenario they appear in. For example,\
  \ there is usually a scenario rule related to examining cards when Kaze is around.\
  \ By encountering these villains several times, it was possible to flesh them out\
  \ more, and I didn't need to make a huge number of custom cards you would use just\
  \ once.</p>\n             <p>In Emerald Legacy, sidequests are the only way to earn\
  \ loot cards, and they have minor and major consequences for later parts of the\
  \ AP and the ending of the story! I've introduced 2 sidequests for each villain,\
  \ giving you even more opportunities to interact with them.</p>\n             <h2>You'll\
  \ get into all kind of crazy situations.</h2>\n             <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \             <p>I'll openly admit that when I make my homebrew adventure paths,\
  \ I often try to incorporate my favorite mechanics from the official material, which\
  \ you can consider as my love letter to the game. In particular, Mummy's Mask had\
  \ a big influence on many of Emerald Legacy's cards and scenarios.</p>\n       \
  \      <div class=\"blurb360\">\n              <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180720-Shen.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180720-Shen_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n              <br><em>Illustration by Ben Wootten</em>. \n              <p></p>\n\
  \             </div>\n             <p>However, I also try to come up with new mechanics\
  \ and ways to make the game feel different from what you are used to. Emerald Legacy\
  \ contains a new type of scenario that I like to think of as \"Showdown Scenarios.\"\
  \ These all use the Shrine of Sealing, a location where characters are not allowed\
  \ to start. No matter what you do, the villains will eventually all end up in the\
  \ Shrine of Sealing, and you need to close all other locations before you can win.\
  \ Assuming you win the fight against a villain, it's actually better not to temporarily\
  \ close any locations in these scenarios, which has a major impact on how you can\
  \ approach them.</p>\n             <p>Here's a short list of my favorite 5 features\
  \ from other Emerald Legacy scenarios, in no particular order:</p>\n           \
  \  <ul>\n              <li>There is a self-proclaimed \"sharkomancer\" that lets\
  \ you roll on a shark table.</li>\n              <li>You can reunite a dinosaur\
  \ with its lost baby (or keep it for yourself—I'm not judging).</li>\n         \
  \     <li>There is an anti-magic zone that your casters won't like very much.</li>\n\
