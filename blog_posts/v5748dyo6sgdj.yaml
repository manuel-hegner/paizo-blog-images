  \    </div> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Closing in on the end of <i>Doomsday\
  \ Dawn</i>, the guys from the Order of the Amber Die are here with their report\
  \ on Part 6—\"Red Flags\"! Keep in mind that there are spoilers in this report,\
  \ so if you haven't played through the adventure and don't want to know any secrets,\
  \ come back after you're done.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>As you've probably\
  \ noticed from our blog reports over the years, our members enjoy the sense of competition\
  \ that comes from pitting themselves against published adventures. With this in\
  \ mind, one of the ways we've maintained our intensity through so many complete\
  \ playthroughs and reports of each playtest scenario has been to track our team's\
  \ win/loss record. <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo670md?Order-of-the-Amber-DieDoomsday-Dawn-Playtest\"\
  >Part 1</a>: Win. <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo6sg9p?Order-of-the-Amber-DieDoomsday-Dawn-Playtest\"\
  >Part 2</a>: Loss. <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgb4?Order-of-the-Amber-DieDoomsday-Dawn-Playtest\"\
  >Part 3</a>: Win. <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgc1?Order-of-the-Amber-DieDoomsday-Dawn-Playtest\"\
  >Part 4</a>: Loss. <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgcx?Order-of-the-Amber-DieDoomsday-Dawn-Playtest\"\
  >Part 5</a>: Loss. So, at 2–3 it was clear going into Part 6 that we needed a win\
  \ if we even wanted a chance to finish out with a positive record. Two factors upped\
  \ the pressure even more, and the first was the author himself. In nearly 150 published\
  \ adventures completed, and despite being aware of his long involvement in the history\
  \ of the game, by random chance we had never played an adventure by Stephen Radney-MacFarland.\
  \ The second factor had to do with a certain name he chose for a sunken ship in\
  \ this adventure: Blackguard's Revenge. Everyone in OAD fears that name, since we\
  \ have quite a storied relationship with the 2005 module by the same name (<a href=\"\
  /community/blog/v5748dyo5lj2f?Order-of-the-Amber-Die-The-Strange-Aeons\">described\
  \ here</a>); we had no choice but to take it as a sign that Besmara herself had\
  \ a stake in part six of our playtest.</p> \n     <p>Since we were headed to what\
  \ was essentially a pirate party in \"Red Flags,\" we decided to make the session\
  \ into some revelry of our own—complete with the best laughs of our playtest run.\
  \ This scenario also had the largest map of the playtest, so we turned to the talents\
  \ of <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BlackBardStudios/\">Black Bard Studios</a>,\
  \ who brought its 10-foot scale to life by crafting a setup of the entire coastal\
  \ stronghold: thirty-five square feet! Adding some nice accents were the latest\
  \ pieces from <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/701587775/fantasy-facades-3d-rpg-terrain-by-bannerless-build?ref=606704&amp;token=b86df1fa\"\
  >Bannerless Builds</a> and <a href=\"http://bluetablepainting.com/\">Blue Table\
  \ Painting</a>. With our seafaring personas ready, we were on our way!</p> \n  \
  \   <h2>The Party</h2> \n     <p>This was the scenario in which we were to create\
  \ a party that was heavily roleplaying focused. We added our own playtest goal of\
  \ making characters who took advantage of the new archetype system to give us the\
  \ feel of multiclass characters from previous editions. Each player also had to\
  \ choose how their particular character served the Esoteric Order of the Palatine\
  \ Eye. Also listed are the names of each player on the team who committed their\
  \ time to this detailed playthrough, and the year each became a member of the Order\
  \ (when a player reaches 100 hours at our table).</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-title\"\

  \ to a new edition was bound to bring a couple of humorous stumbles, and this scenario\
  \ had our favorite of any scenario. We were pumped to open the session strong, and\
  \ after some shouts of encouragement at the table, fired off the <i>teleport</i>\
  \ spell that would take us to the island known as the Smoker. Though we were expecting\
  \ an exciting description of the place to follow, we instead saw water. Lots of\
  \ water, and we were in it. The new rules for <i>teleport</i> meant that because\
  \ it was more than 100 miles from Caliphas to the Shackles, we would arrive with\
  \ a 1% margin of error. Good thing we were packing a second <i>teleport</i>!</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The guest list for the gala included a contract devil, an evil sorcerer\
  \ (the party's nemesis) and his goblin butler, along with the host of the festivities—\
  a tengu Free Captain. Let's just say this gave a certain emphasis to the 'ole \"\
  Let's try to blend in.\" We've got to hand the roleplaying MVP award to Sean, and\
  \ after you see how his dice aided his words, you'll also understand how he survived\
  \ a diplomatic dance with the devil.</p> \n     <p>After our social skills were\
  \ tested, the scenario took a twist, and we had to make our way past several high-level\
  \ traps. One such trap was a series of shifting portals that appeared to forcefully\
  \ thrust anyone with an incorrect guess backwards onto iron spikes. We could try\
  \ to figure it out, or like high-level characters should be able to do, lean on\
  \ our abilities. Three castings of <i>passwall</i> later, we were headed deeper\
  \ into the fortress.</p> \n     <h2>Character Deaths</h2> \n     <p>Going up against\
  \ a kraken was likely to send someone to the Boneyard. Nezam did everything he could\
  \ to stay alive, but the beast ground through his hero points and crushed the wizard\
  \ into data to feed our playtest.</p> \n     <h2>Current Situation</h2> \n     <p>Headed\
  \ into the final encounter, things couldn't have been stacked any worse against\
  \ a team desperate for a win. We had to face a kraken with our least combat-oriented\
  \ party of the entire playtest. As its many tentacles bore down on us with a 60-foot\
  \ reach, we were moments from accepting that it was all over. Then we remembered\
  \ the mission goal and realized that we didn't have to beat the kraken—just get\
  \ past it. Thanks to a combination of the cave's unique layout, several timely castings\
  \ of <i>dimension door</i>, and three characters with the Quick Unlock skill feat,\
  \ we pulled off one of the canniest victories in OAD history. We're 3–3 overall\
  \ now, and headed into the final scenario with a chance to close out with a winning\
  \ record!</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Follow Order of the Amber Die on <a href=\"\
