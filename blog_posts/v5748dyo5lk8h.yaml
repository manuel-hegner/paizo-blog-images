  \ of Nature</h1> \n    <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"> \n     <p class=\"date\">Tuesday,\
  \ October 31, 2017</p> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Since people starting\
  \ telling stories around the very first campfires, there have been heroes and villains\
  \ who could shuffle off the coil of humanity in favor for something a little more\
  \ wild, more primal, and more powerful. While shapechangers are nothing new in the\
  \ Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, for the upcoming <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Ultimate-Wilderness\"\
  ><i>Ultimate Wilderness</i></a>, we wanted to present a new take on the old trope—\
  the shifter.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb360\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20171031-ShiftersRush.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20171031-ShiftersRush_360.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>This class is one infused with primal magic. The base class\
  \ serves as a guardian for druidic circles and is firmly rooted in those ancient\
  \ religious traditions. While she is no spellcaster, a shifter's innate shifting\
  \ magic is partly druidic mystery. The shifter learns Druidic and adheres to a philosophy\
  \ similar to her druidic cousins, but her magic is very different. Like the hunter,\
  \ the shifter is the master of the animal aspect, from the stealty bat to the terrifying\
  \ deinonychus, but even more visible results. She uses those aspects to change her\
  \ form and gain the power in more powerful ways. The most overt of these aspects\
  \ is her ability to grow powerful claws. Without the need for manufactured weapons,\
  \ she can defend the wilderness and her circle with ever-growing power that few\
  \ can face for long. With increased experience comes increased control over her\
  \ gifts. As she gains levels, she gains more aspects, as well as the ability to\
  \ take her aspect's true form via akin to <i>beast shape II</i>. But unlike other\
  \ shapechangers, she is not rooted in a single form. She can meld her lesser aspects\
  \ and even enrich her true polymorphed forms with her lesser aspects, creating a\
  \ chimeric form which can enrich her scouting and combat prowess.</p> \n     <p>Fully\
  \ at one with the natural world, the shifter is more than a pure brawler. She also\
  \ sports a defensive instinct granting her greater defenses when unfettered by armor\
  \ or shields. She also gains wild empathy, track, woodland stride, and trackless\
  \ step, making her as at home in the wild lands as any druid, hunter, or ranger.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>At the highest levels, the shifter becomes a true master of forms. Her\
  \ claws can tear through the most powerful enemy defenses. Her shape can be fine-tuned\
  \ to confront whatever challenge she faces. She can slip into the mists and the\
  \ shadows, only to return as a raging beast unrivaled by her foe's greatest nightmares.\
  \ She is nature's wrath incarnate</p> \n     <p>While the base class is firmly tied\
  \ to the world of druid circles, archetypes allow you to play shifters of a different\
  \ stripe. The elemental shifter grants forms tied to the various elemental planes,\
  \ the fiendflesh shifter detail those who make fiendish pacts for their power, while\
  \ the oozemorph allows you to play an oozy creature who takes humanoid form as its\
  \ disguise instead. Of course, just like all our Ultimate books, the new class isn't\
  \ the only one getting new toys to play with. <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Ultimate-Wilderness\"\
  ><i>Ultimate Wilderness</i></a> features a bunch of new archetypes for all the nature-themed\
  \ classes and nature-infused takes on other classes. A personal favorite of mine\
  \ is the green knight archetype for the cavalier. This archetype melds the Arthurian\
  \ myths with high fantasy resulting in a stalwart protector of all things verdant\
  \ and wild.</p> \n     <p>In case you haven't heard, <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Ultimate-Wilderness\"\
  ><i>Ultimate Wilderness</i></a> also features new, nature-based, core races that\
  \ you can play. Two of those races—the long-time favorite and delicious ghoran,\
  \ and the band new vine leshy—are plant creatures. Those of you who pay close attention\
  \ to the game's creature types might be wondering how these new races can become\
  \ shifters. After all, the plant creature type has immunity to polymorph effects.\
  \ No worries, we have you covered, we have made some adjustments to the plant creature\
  \ type when they are played as a PC race. While you may lose some of the more powerful\
  \ immunities to damage types, you gain the ability to use the shifter class, and\
  \ polymorph spells to their full effect. You'll find these changes in a sidebar\
  \ located in Chapter 1: Wilderness Heroes of the book.</p> \n     <p>Altogether,\
  \ the new shifter class along with a wealth of new options presented in <a href=\"\
  http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Ultimate-Wilderness\"\
  ><i>Ultimate Wilderness</i></a> will enrich your game, whether you are out in the\
  \ wilderness or just have a hankering for playing some wild and different. Enjoy\
  \ your walk on the wild side!</p> \n     <p>Stephen Radney-MacFarland<br> <i>Senior\
