  \  <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Creating new rules and expansions\
  \ for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game takes a lot of work. Over the past year, the\
  \ design team has been focused on rounding out the core of the game, with the release\
  \ of the Advanced Player’s Guide and the Beginner Box, and as we continue planning\
  \ and working on projects for 2021 and beyond, it has become clear that we need\
  \ more help to continue bringing great additions like these to your game table.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>So today, I am happy to announce that the Design Team has added not\
  \ one, but two new members to the staff, Michael Sayre and James Case! I doubt they\
  \ are strangers to most of you, both having been brought over from our Organized\
  \ Play program. Having got my start in Organized Play over 20 years ago, I can tell\
  \ you that experience managing and developing scenarios in that environment is a\
  \ great way to hone your skills and give you a deep insight into the game. So, it\
  \ should come as no surprise that Michael and James have both gotten off to a terrific\
  \ start here on the team. I hope you will all join me in welcoming them to the Design\
  \ Team.</p> \n      <p>With that, I am going to turn this blog over to them so they\
  \ can tell you a little bit about themselves and what they bring to the team!</p>\
  \ \n      <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold;\">Jason Bulmahn<br> <em>Director\
  \ of Game Design</em></p> \n      <br> \n      <p>Hello!<br> I’m <b>Michael Sayre</b>,\
  \ one of the new designers here at Paizo. I’ve spent the last decade writing for\
  \ TTRPGs, particularly Pathfinders first and second editions. In addition to working\
  \ for Paizo as both a freelancer and the Pathfinder Society Developer, I’ve also\
  \ done design and development work for other TTRPG companies like Amora Games, Drop\
  \ Dead Studios, Legendary Games, Lost Spheres Publishing, Rogue Genius Games, and\
  \ more. It’s been a real privilege to come join what I consider to be the most talented\
  \ team of game designers in the industry and I’m excited for all of you to see what\
  \ we are creating together. My first big job in my new role has been taking the\
  \ lead on an awesome new book that we haven’t announced <em>just</em> yet but keep\
  \ a close eye on our announcements early in the new year! I’m looking forward to\
  \ talking to all of you about the great steps we can take as we move forward with\
  \ Pathfinder’s second edition, and sharing some of the cool ideas we’ve already\
  \ got under way!</p> \n      <p>Hi everyone, I’m <b>James Case</b>! I first joined\
  \ Paizo as an editor right as the Pathfinder Playtest was starting up, before moving\
  \ to work on the living campaign as part of Organized Play, and I’m excited to now\
  \ be joining the design team! Having worked in ESL and editing, I’m especially interested\
  \ in how we can design rules that are fun and exciting to play with, but also easy\
  \ to pick up and run. I hope to get to know everyone better as we move forward with\
  \ all the projects we have in the works! If you want to talk games, music, memes,\
  \ or hyphen usage, you can catch me on The Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/toriariaria\"\
