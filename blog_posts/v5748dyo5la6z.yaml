  \ Murder!</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Monday, May 21, 2007</p> \n   <p>The foundation\
  \ of a new town is not a matter to be taken lightly, nor one to be funded by one\
  \ soul. Four powerful families from the city of Magnimar had designs on settling\
  \ a region 50 miles to the northeast, and rather than work against each other, they\
  \ consolidated their efforts and formed the Sandpoint Mercantile League. These four\
  \ families, the Ameikos (glassmakers and jewelers), the Valdemars (shipbuilders\
  \ and carpenters), the Scarnettis (loggers and millers), and the Deverins (farmers\
  \ and brewers), sailed north to claim their land after securing the rights from\
  \ the Magnimar Charterhouse. Yet when they arrived, they found the place already\
  \ settled by a particularly large tribe of Varisians, who held the region as a traditional\
  \ place to spend the winter.</p> \n   <p>Unwilling to change course, the Sandpoint\
  \ Mercantile League began a series of talks with the Varisians, promising them an\
  \ important place in the new township. Unfortunately, after a week of talks seemed\
  \ to go nowhere, an impatient man named Alamon Scarnetti took matters into his own\
  \ hands. Rounding up a group of his brothers and cousins, the Scarnettis mounted\
  \ a murderous raid on the Varisian camp, intending to kill them all and leave evidence\
  \ implicating local goblins for the deed. Yet the Scarnettis, too drunk and overconfident,\
  \ only managed to kill five Varisians before they were themselves forced to flee,\
  \ leaving behind three of their own. The incident caused a several-month delay,\
  \ but eventually amends were made and the town of Sandpoint was born.</p> \n   <p>Despite\
  \ these violent first months, in the forty-odd years since Sandpoint was founded,\
  \ things have been rather calm and quiet. The late unpleasantness, involving Chopper's\
  \ murderous spree and followed closely by the Sandpoint Fire, constitute the worst\
  \ thing that's happened to the town. Yet Sandpoint's current mayor, Kendra Deverin\
  \ (female human aristocrat 3/expert 4), can't shake the feeling that the unpleasantness\
  \ was but a preamble, and that dark times indeed are coming to her home town.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>The excellent headshot accompanying this post is one of several Andrew\
  \ Hou's worked up for <i>Pathfinder</i>—Kendra Deverin herself. Kendra has served\
  \ as Sandpoint's mayor for the past five years. Lawmaker, judge, and general peacemaker,\
  \ she has proven to be both an adept diplomat and stern hand when need be, both\
  \ skills honed during her youth in Magnimar. With a personal—some say sisterly—\
  style of governing, most of Sandpoint's citizens hold deep respect for their fiery-haired\
  \ mayor. </p>\n   <p>James Jacobs<br> Editor-in-Chief, <i>Pathfinder</i></p> \n\
