  \ <p itemprop=\"description\">The bard—it's arguably the most iconic support character.\
  \ For some reason, bards are often the butt of goofy jokes, even though they're\
  \ powerful force multipliers who can contribute to just about every aspect of play.\
  \ Bard is one of my favorite classes in Pathfinder, and it has some of the most\
  \ exciting changes of any of the classes in the Pathfinder Playtest, but I'm going\
  \ to start you with a big one first. Are you sitting down yet? OK, good:</p> \n\
  \    <p>Bards are full 10-level spellcasters.</p> \n    <h2>Spellcasting</h2> \n\
  \    <p>As before, bards are spontaneous spellcasters who make up for having not\
  \ quite as many spells as the other spontaneous caster, the sorcerer, by having\
  \ special bardic performances. But this time around, bards don't have a delayed\
  \ spellcasting progression. Instead, they have one fewer spell in their repertoire\
  \ and one fewer spell slot per day at each spell level, compared to the sorcerer.\
  \ That's pretty awesome already, but here's the even cooler part: bards have collected\
  \ all sorts of esoteric bardic knowledge since forever, right? With an offbeat spell\
  \ list that combines mental magic, a handful of unique additions, and a little bit\
  \ of healing, bards are the primary occult spellcasters, blending mental and spiritual\
  \ essences. That brings bards, whose spell list has grown with far less than that\
  \ of wizards, to the forefront among the other primary spellcasters. This has given\
  \ us the opportunity to create a bunch of cool never-before-seen bard spells for\
  \ the playtest. Also, as I mentioned in the <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkpv?All-About-Spells\"\
  >spells blog</a>, bards can replace the Somatic Casting and Verbal Casting components\
  \ of spellcasting by playing a musical instrument, in case you want a bard who plays\
  \ the violin to cast his spells! But what about their performances? How do those\
  \ come into play?</p> \n    <h2>Compositions</h2> \n    <p>Compositions are a special\
  \ type of spell that only bards gain. You might be thinking these are probably powers\
  \ like other classes, right? Not so! In exchange for their slightly lower number\
  \ of spells bards get, most of their compositions are cantrips, usable at will,\
  \ meaning you no longer need to worry about running out of bardic performance rounds\
  \ per day. Not only that, they're often cast with a single action. They start out\
  \ with a composition that will likely look familiar.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n \
  \    <p class=\"stat-block-title\">Inspire Courage <span class=\"stat-block-cr\"\
  >Cantrip</span></p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">Cantrip, Composition, Emotion,\
  \ Enchantment, Mental<br> <b>Casting</b> [[A]] Verbal Casting<br> <b>Area</b> 60-foot\
  \ aura<br> <b>Duration</b> 1 round</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block\">You inspire\
  \ your allies with words or tunes of encouragement. You and all allies in the aura\
  \ gain a +1 conditional bonus to attack rolls, damage rolls, and saves against fear.</p>\
  \ \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Usually, a bard can cast only one composition per\
  \ turn and have only one active at a time.</p> \n    <p>Bards have powers and Spell\
  \ Points in addition to their compositions. Many bard powers allow you to manipulate\
  \ and customize your performances as you desire, including increasing the duration,\
  \ granting a more significant bonus (an extremely powerful benefit), or having multiple\
  \ compositions active at a time. Typically, these extra benefits require a successful\
  \ Performance check to activate and provide an even more powerful effect on a critical\
  \ success. Take for example, lingering composition.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\"\

  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20180716-Lem_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n     <p><i>Illustration by Wayne Reynolds</i></p>\n    </div> \n    <blockquote>\
  \ \n     <p class=\"stat-block-title\">Lingering Composition <span class=\"stat-block-cr\"\
  >Power 1</span></p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">Enchantment, Power<br> <b>Casting</b>\
  \ [[F]] Verbal Casting; <b>Trigger</b> You finish casting a cantrip composition\
  \ with a duration of 1 round.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block\">You attempt to\
  \ add a flourish to your composition to extend its benefits. Attempt a Performance\
  \ check. The DC is usually a high-difficulty DC of a level equal to the highest-level\
  \ target of your composition, but the GM can assign a different DC based on the\
  \ circumstances. The effect depends on the result of your check.</p> \n     <p class=\"\
  stat-block-1\"><b>Success</b> The composition lasts 2 rounds.<br> <b>Critical Success</b>\
  \ The composition lasts 3 rounds.<br> <b>Failure</b> The composition lasts 1 round.</p>\
  \ \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>But altering your performances with special modifications\
  \ like this is just one of several paths represented by a new bardic class feature…\
  </p> \n    <h2>Muses</h2> \n    <p>A bard's inspiration comes from a unique place—\
  his muse. There are three muses in the Pathfinder Playtest. The first is maestro,\
  \ focused on powers that alter compositions. Next is lore, focused on Occultism,\
  \ willpower, and unusual knowledge. The third is polymath, focused on being a jack\
  \ of all trades with increased skills and ability to handle unexpected situations,\
  \ including the ability to keep a spellbook to prepare a small number of new spells\
  \ to add to your repertoire each day. As befits the individualistic nature of a\
  \ performer's muse, none of the initial muse abilities are exclusive, so you can\
  \ use your feats to traverse as deeply as you want into the abilities from each\
  \ path; your muse merely represents a starting point on your bardic journey.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>For example, if you select the maestro muse at 1st level, you gain the\
  \ Lingering Composition bard feat (granting you the lingering composition power\
  \ detailed above) and add soothe to your spell repertoire, but any bard can take\
  \ this feat or learn this spell—selecting the maestro muse just grants them as a\
  \ default.</p> \n    <h2>Bard Features</h2> \n    <p>As a bard, you gain spellcasting\
  \ and occult spell proficiency at the same levels as the other spellcasters, new\
  \ spell levels at every odd level except 19, expert proficiency in occult spells\
  \ at 12th level, master proficiency at 16th level, and legendary proficiency at\
  \ 19th level. You also have the most trained skills at 1st level except for rogues,\
  \ just barely edging out rangers. Finally, you begin play at 1st level with two\
  \ compositions, the inspire courage cantrip (which has been detailed above) and\
  \ the counter performance power.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-title\"\
  >Counter Performance <span class=\"stat-block-cr\">Power 1</span></p> \n     <p\
  \ class=\"stat-block-1\">Composition, Enchantment, Fortune, Mental, Power<br> <b>Casting</b>\
  \ [[R]] Verbal Casting or [[R]] Somatic Casting; <b>Trigger</b> You or an ally within\
  \ 60 feet must roll a saving throw against an auditory or visual effect.<br> <b>Area</b>\
  \ 60-foot aura</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block\">You protect yourself and allies\
  \ through performance. Choose an auditory performance if the trigger was auditory\
  \ or a visual performance if it was visual, then roll a Performance check for the\
  \ chosen performance. You and allies in the area can use the higher result of your\
  \ Performance check or their saving throws.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Since\
  \ you need to use only a reaction to cast counter performance, rather than needing\
  \ to activate it ahead of time like in Pathfinder First Edition, creatures that\
  \ rely on visual or auditory effects will have a really hard time messing with you!</p>\
  \ \n    <h2>Bard Feats</h2> \n    <p>Bard feats tend to fall in two categories:\
  \ feats associated that are loosely associated with one of the three muses, and\
  \ those that grant you a new composition.</p> \n    <p>For instance, the Cantrip\
  \ Expansion feat at 4th level allows you to add two cantrips from the occult spell\
  \ list to your spell repertoire, which can come in handy for those bards with the\
  \ lore or the polymath muses. The powerful 14th-level Allegro feat, on the other\
  \ hand, grants you the following cantrip to add a spring to an ally's step.</p>\
  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-title\">Allegro <span class=\"\
  stat-block-cr\">Cantrip</span></p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-1\">Cantrip, Composition,\
  \ Emotion, Enchantment, Mental<br> <b>Casting</b> [[A]] Verbal Casting<br> <b>Range</b>\
  \ 30 feet; <b>Targets</b> one ally<br> <b>Duration</b> 1 round</p> \n     <p class=\"\
  stat-block\">You perform rapidly, speeding your ally. The ally is quick and can\
  \ use the action to Strike, Stride, or Step.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>There's\
  \ plenty of favorites in there from among bardic masterpieces from Ultimate Magic\
  \ too, like house of imaginary walls, which Cosmo used with his goblin bard to mime\
  \ a box around my ranger, trapping me with a dangerous enemy while Cosmo remained\
  \ safe and sound.</p> \n    <p>In a nutshell, bards now have a vast number of quality-of-life\
  \ improvements, while fundamentally staying true to the way they worked before.\
  \ Fellow bard fans, what do you think?</p> \n    <p>Mark Seifter<br> <i>Designer</i></p>\
