  \ Dark Archive</p> \n      <p>My future and fellow Archivists,<br> The Dark Archive\
  \ is no more, except for me. When the Pathfinder Society announced that our faction\
  \ was to be dissolved, absorbed into its other departments, I grabbed the files\
  \ I could and left before they could stop me. These pages are all that remain of\
  \ our faction’s records, and I am all that remains of our membership.</p> \n   \
  \   <p>This world of ours is strange, isn’t it? I muse on this idea more often than\
  \ I care to admit, vital though it may be to our work. The most common description\
  \ of the Dark Archive is that we “investigate the paranormal” and that’s... true,\
  \ but it’s a description by negation. If we are to turn our gaze to the “paranormal”\
  , first we must ask: what is normal? </p> \n      <p>We know a staggering number\
  \ of things about our world. We know of its general size and diversity of terrain,\
  \ as well as a vast majority of the peoples and creatures that inhabit it. We know\
  \ of the void that hangs above it, and that other worlds, some with peoples and\
  \ creatures of their own, lie across that void, or even on other planes of existence.\
  \ Beyond even this, consider all the endeavors that have expanded the normal even\
  \ further. Consider the fields of alchemy and the burgeoning craft of clockwork\
  \ engineering. Consider the magic that we have split into schools, the meticulous\
  \ cataloging of its sources that we have uncovered and explored. This is all within\
  \ the boundaries of the normal. </p> \n      <p>I apologize for being long-winded;\
  \ I wanted to provide enough description to, hopefully, plant in you the same question\
  \ that drives each of us, that defines our work, that first brought me, far too\
  \ many years ago, to the Dark Archive’s doorstep: what could there possibly be left\
  \ to find? </p> \n      <p>This is what we mean by “paranormal.” Though some might\
  \ recoil in fear from such unknowns, my hope is that they excite you. In these casefiles,\
  \ I’ve done my best to compile every lead we collected in the course of our efforts\
  \ to part the strands of the unknown that keep us from uncovering the truth as we\
  \ gaze into the darkness.”</p> \n      <center>\n       <h4><a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy88qu?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Subscription\"\

  \ volcano known as Droskar’s Crag, the dim, mist-laden forests are prowled by feral\
  \ beasts, ravenous monsters, and the restless souls of the dead. Once, a great dwarven\
  \ kingdom brought safety and stability to the region, but that all ended with the\
  \ wakening of Droskar’s Crag during the apocalypse known today as the Rending. For\
  \ too long did sibilant whispers ride the vale winds after nightfall in the aftermath\
  \ of this disaster, and during those desperate years, evil took root in the hidden\
  \ places deep below. Today, the land has recovered from the volcanic eruption, and\
  \ as is humanity’s wont, settlers have returned to the region. “Only the Desperate\
  \ and the Brave” came to build Falcon’s Hollow, and time has appeared to reward\
  \ that desperation and bravery, for now their home feels relatively safe and secure.</p>\
  \ \n       <p>This is all a lie, for what awaits the people of Falcon’s Hollow deep\

  \  <p>“The undead-populated nation of Geb is the principal food exporter to many\
  \ nations throughout the Inner Sea. Few foreigners hold the undead nation or its\
  \ melancholic ghost king with anything other than distaste, but they’ve come to\
  \ rely on Geb’s cheap, zombie-raised food. That reliance puts these nations at a\
  \ significant risk when the ghost king’s scheming right-hand vampire looks to sacrifice\
  \ thousands for his personal power. </p> \n       <p>Geb, the infamous necromancer,\
  \ founded the nation millennia ago. After his earth-scorching war with the archmage\
  \ Nex ground to a halt, Geb found no passion for ruling and no meaning without his\
  \ rivalry, so he ended his life, but arose as a ghost. No more interested in rulership\
  \ as a ghost than he had as a living man, Geb mostly retreated from public view\
  \ and entrusted control of the country to his 60 apprentices, the Blood Lords. </p>\
  \ \n       <p>The Blood Lords swiftly secured an iron grip on the nation. They leveraged\
  \ Geb’s rival economic factions to cement this control, playing the factions off\
  \ each other and maneuvering Geb’s people and assets like pawns in a great game.\
  \ Fearing old age and refusing to share power, many Blood Lords transformed themselves\
  \ into undead. Some of today’s Blood Lords are the same scheming necromancers who\
  \ originally served Geb while he lived. Chief among them is Chancellor Kemnebi,\
  \ Geb’s principal advisor.”</p> \n       <center>\n        <h4><a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy7ym4?Pathfinder-Modules-Subscription\"\

  >Starfinder Interstellar Species</a></h3> \n      <blockquote> \n       <p>Starfinder\
  \ has more than 100 unique species available for you to choose from when creating\
  \ a player character. These species have appeared across hardcovers, Adventure Paths,\
  \ Starfinder Society scenarios, and even the <em>Alien Character Deck</em>. With\
  \ such a wide breadth of options already, this book provides more depth on 25 of\
  \ those playable species—many of which were selected to appear in this book thanks\
  \ to a public poll of Starfinder fans asking what species they’d like to learn more\
  \ about. </p> \n       <p><b>A NOTE ON TERMS</b><br> This book uses the word “species”\
  \ in place of “race” and “racial” for the purposes of building a character, playable\
  \ species traits, bonus types, and similar rules elements—this change doesn’t otherwise\
  \ affect the mechanics of these elements, and it applies across all Starfinder products.</p>\
  \ \n       <p><b>CLASSES </b><br> The classes chapter kicks things off with a new\
  \ class: the evolutionist, a class all about transformation and augmentation, starting\
  \ on page 10. The chapter continues with a bevy of new class options for the biohacker,\
  \ envoy, mechanic, nanocyte, operative, precog, and soldier.</p> \n       <p><b>SPECIES</b><br>\
  \ The second chapter begins with a table of the 100+ playable species in Starfinder,\
  \ complete with headshot, short description, and reference. Whether you’re making\
  \ a new player character, throwing together an NPC on the spot, or just curious\
  \ about what Starfinder has to offer, this reference will inspire.</p> \n      \
  \ <p><b>Species Builder</b><br> If you’ve scoured the stars for the perfect species\
  \ but nothing is quite the right fit for your ideal Starfinder character, why not\
  \ make your own? Using a series of simple, nonlinear steps, you can create your\
  \ own playable species for Starfinder, complete with mechanics, physiology, and\
  \ backstory. Whether you want to recreate a species from your favorite fiction or\
  \ invent something entirely new, this system has you covered!</p> \n       <p><b>Species\
  \ Profiles</b><br> Along with the rules needed to play them, each of the 25 species\
  \ profiles in this book contains new art, a physical description, details about\
  \ that species’ home world and society, and a deep dive on something that makes\
  \ them unique. You’ll even learn naming conventions and sample names for that species!\
  \ Each species profile also offers a selection of player options—everything from\
  \ feats to spells to equipment—that are thematically tied to that species, but generally\
  \ not mechanically tied, so they’re available to a wide array of characters.</p>\
  \ \n       <p><b>NPC GALLERY</b><br> One hundred NPCs of expansive variety await\
  \ you in chapter 3, ranging from CR 1/2 to CR 20, and each with its own niche. You\
  \ can drop these into your games from whole cloth or make a few simple adjustments\
  \ to better fit your campaign; advice is included for how to do just that in the\
  \ chapter introduction on page 150.</p> \n       <p><b>INDEX</b><br> If you want\
  \ to jump straight to the player options for your character, check out the index\
  \ on page 188, which includes categories of the various player character options\
  \ that appear throughout this book. </p> \n       <p><b>EVOLUTIONIST INFORMATION</b><br>\
  \ The following two sections of this introduction provide information for applying\
  \ an archetype to an evolutionist player character or applying an evolutionist class\
  \ graft to an NPC.“</p> \n       <center>\n        <h4><a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy9tqw?Starfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Subscription\"\
