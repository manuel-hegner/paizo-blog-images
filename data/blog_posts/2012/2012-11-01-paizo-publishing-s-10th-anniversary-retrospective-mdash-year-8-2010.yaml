  Year 8 (2010)</h1>\n            <div itemprop=\"articleBody\">\n             <h2>Following\
  \ Up on Our Success</h2>\n             <p class=\"date\">Thursday, November 1, 2012</p>\n\
  \             <p class=\"tiny\" align=\"center\"><em>This blog entry is the ninth\
  \ in a series of blogs commemorating Paizo's 10th anniversary.<br><a href=\"/paizo/blog/2012/february/v5748dyo5ld43\"\
  >Click here to read the first installment</a>.</em></p>\n             <p>Before\
  \ it was even released in August 2009, the <a href=\"products/btpy88yj?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Core-Rulebook\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook</em></a> was already the single best\
  \ selling product Paizo had ever produced, and October's <a href=\"products/btpy8auu?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Bestiary\"\
  ><em>Bestiary</em></a> immediately captured the number two slot. The stunning sales\
  \ numbers made it very easy to see why many companies fall into the trap of producing\
  \ too many rulebooks for their games—it's very tempting to go back to that well\
  \ for another drink.</p>\n             <p>But Ryan Dancey and I had spotted that\
  \ trap in 1999 when we were at Wizards of the Coast, analyzing the recently acquired\
  \ TSR business. Putting out rulebooks every month or two quickly overwhelms your\
  \ audience. And once customers decide that they can't keep up with new releases,\
  \ they begin making choices about which books they need and which ones they can\
  \ do without, which means you sell fewer copies of even your most popular books.\
  \ And fewer copies means lower print runs, which means higher unit costs, which\
  \ means lower margins. And even worse: when customers start skipping releases, it\
  \ becomes easier and easier for them to stop buying your products altogether.</p>\n\
  \             <p>On the other hand, if you publish new books too slowly, players\
  \ who exhaust content quickly will begin to feel that their needs aren't supported,\
  \ and they'll start looking for other game systems. And players left waiting too\
  \ long for their favorite rules subsets will also get discouraged. You have to strike\
  \ a balance.</p>\n             <p>Ryan and I decided that the magic number for major\
  \ hardcover rulebooks per year—the number that would keep the most customers satiated\
  \ but not overwhelmed—was probably three. That was part of the plan we were going\
  \ to implement for D&amp;D Third Edition at Wizards, but the two of us didn't last\
  \ long there after the launch, and the management team that replaced us had different\
  \ ideas.</p>\n             <p><span itemprop=\"description\">So when it came time\
  \ for us to formulate a strategy for the Pathfinder RPG line, I went back to our\
  \ plan from ten years earlier. I pitched my team here at Paizo on it and was surprised\
  \ how quickly everyone came on board. Then came the hard part—if you only have three\
  \ products a year, what should those products be?</span></p>\n             <p>First,\
  \ we came up with a timetable—there would be one release in the spring, another\
  \ at Gen Con in August, and a third at the end of the year, close to the holidays.</p>\n\
  \             <div class=\"blurb120\">\n              <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/20121101-APGSketch.jpg\"\

  \ approvals!\n             </div>\n             <p>Pathfinder Society was growing\
  \ by leaps and bounds, and the experience that Erik, Jason, and I had with the RPGA\
  \ suggested that we might want to release our most rules-heavy books at Gen Con.\
  \ We also knew we wanted to do one monster/adversary book each year for the foreseeable\
  \ future, and because the Bestiary came out at the end of the year, we decided to\
  \ schedule future ones in the winter slot.</p>\n             <p>That left the spring\
  \ release, which we would keep flexible. We had a lot of ideas for books that didn't\
  \ fall into the other two categories, and this spot would be the perfect place to\
  \ put those. Our first spring release was a pretty easy choice. Because we had published\
  \ all of our core rules in a single book, there wasn't a direct equivalent to D&amp;D's\
  \ DM's Guide, but we still felt a need to do a book aimed at Game Masters, giving\
  \ them advice and tools for becoming an expert GM and elevating the experience for\
  \ their players. To create this book, we tapped into the expertise of some of the\
  \ best designers in the history of gaming, and they shared their tips and secrets.\
  \ The <a href=\"products/btpy8ffn?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-GameMastery-Guide\"\
  ><em>GameMastery Guide</em></a> came out in May 2010, and has been doing very well\
  \ for us ever since.</p>\n             <p>For the first Gen Con after the release\
  \ of the <em>Core Rulebook</em>, we needed to have something sexy that would allow\
  \ us to show some design chops... something that would give Pathfinder RPG players\
  \ new toys to play with. We sat in a conference room for about three hours and talked\
  \ about character types we'd seen in fantasy books and movies, or played in other\
  \ fantasy games. Then we talked about how we could build those characters using\
  \ the Pathfinder rules. We could build many of those roles by tweaking existing\
  \ classes in the Core Rulebook; this was the genesis of our archetype system, my\
  \ favorite thing to come out of the book we ended up calling the <a href=\"products/btpy8fo1?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Players-Guide\"\
  ><em>Advanced Player's Guide</em></a>. Archtypes allowed a myriad of character ideas\
  \ to blossom forth, many of them very niche, without having to flood the landscape\
  \ with a bunch of new classes.</p>\n             <p>But there were some roles that\
  \ we felt we couldn't do justice without creating whole new classes. In the end,\
  \ six new base classes rose to the top for the APG—the Alchemist, the Cavalier,\
  \ the Inquisitor, the Oracle, the Summoner, and the Witch. Not only would these\
  \ new base classes allow us to show off what the Paizo design staff could do, but\
  \ they also gave players something new to dig into. We filled out the APG with a\
  \ ton of new content, expanding nearly every part of the existing game.</p>\n  \
  \           <p>Our third hardcover rulebook of the year was the <a href=\"products/btpy8hif?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Bestiary-2\"\
  ><em>Bestiary 2</em></a>. In this installment, we wanted to provide Pathfinder RPG\
  \ versions of many of the popular 3.5-era monsters that hadn't made it into either\
  \ the first Bestiary or the Bonus Bestiary that we did for Free RPG Day 2009. We\
  \ also wanted to flesh out outsiders, and provide an array of creatures of every\
  \ alignment. So you saw a number of Aeons, Agathions, Angels, Archons, Azatas, Daemons,\
  \ Demons, Devils, Elementals, Inevitables, Proteans, and Qlippoths in the book.</p>\n\
  \             <div class=\"blurb120\">\n              <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/20121101-Kingmaker.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/20121101-Kingmaker_120.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\
  \              <br>\n               Wes and James playtest some of the kingdom building\
  \ rules for Kingmaker.\n             </div>\n             <p>For the Adventure Path\
  \ line in 2010, we went a little bit outside of the box. The previous year saw the\
  \ urban campaign <em>Council of Thieves</em> kick off the Pathfinder RPG era, and\
  \ we wanted its successor to steer clear of that territory. So with Kingmaker, we\
  \ tried something we'd never done before: a true sandbox AP. Our APs usually have\
  \ a very solid and somewhat direct storyline, but in <em>Kingmaker</em>, the plot\
  \ became more of a framing device for the true story: that of the characters forming\
  \ and building their own kingdom. Each adventure had a number of mini-adventures\
  \ that could be played in any order or skipped entirely. Players could create kingdoms\
  \ large or small, passive or aggressive, dictatorial or democratic, or anything\
  \ else they envisioned. We were a little apprehensive about the response to this\
  \ type of AP, but Kingmaker has become one of the most successful APs of all time,\
  \ rivaling even Rise of the Runelords in popularity.</p>\n             <p>We also\
  \ added a whole new Pathfinder line in 2010: <a href=\"/pathfinder/tales\">Pathfinder\
  \ Tales</a>. We had previously made a valiant attempt to get into the fiction business\
  \ with our Planet Stories line of pulp fiction, but the book market never quite\
  \ seemed to embrace the line, and sales were never strong. Erik Mona was the passion\
  \ and vision behind Planet Stories, and it was a line he personally loved very much,\
  \ but I felt that if we were going to put time, money and effort into a line, we\
  \ should do it with books that helped support our other products.</p>\n        \
  \     <p>TSR had built quite a nice business with their Dragonlance and Forgotten\
  \ Realms fiction lines, and Games Workshop had more recently built a successful\
  \ line of novels around their Warhammer line; it seemed that the book trade was\
  \ more receptive to new gaming fiction than it was to bringing back long-lost classics.\
  \ Thus was Pathfinder Tales born. For our first couple of novels, we wanted authors\
  \ who would be familiar names to fans of gaming fiction, and to bookstore buyers\
  \ as well. We chose two Forgotten Realms authors, Dave Gross and Elaine Cunningham,\
  \ to launch the line. Dave's book <a href=\"products/btpy8g3n?Pathfinder-Tales-Prince-of-Wolves\"\
  ><em>Prince of Wolves</em></a> arrived at Gen Con, while Elaine's <a href=\"products/btpy8h6j?Pathfinder-Tales-Winter-Witch\"\
  ><em>Winter Witch</em></a> was a holiday release. They didn't quite blast to the\
  \ top of the bestseller lists, but sales were <em>much</em> stronger than Planet\
  \ Stories had been, so we felt cautiously optimistic going forward.</p>\n      \
  \       <p>2010 also gave me a chance to bring back a variation of the very first\
  \ product I was ever involved with in the game industry! In 1987, my first company,\
  \ Lion Rampant, came out with Whimsey Cards—a product that allowed players to insert\
  \ their ideas into roleplaying games in a structured way. The rights to Whimsey\
  \ Cards themselves are owned by other folks, so I modified the basic idea a bit,\
  \ adding an optional Pathfinder RPG-based mechanic, creating Plot Twist Cards. The\
  \ response has been great; we're currently in our second print run. Sometimes oldies\
  \ are indeed goodies.</p>\n             <p>We also revisited another oldie but goodie\
  \ in our boardgame line. Kill Doctor Lucky was—and still is—our best selling boardgame,\
  \ so we extended that line with a deluxe edition of Cheapass Games' Save Doctor\
  \ Lucky prequel. Where KDL is all about trying to get Doctor Lucky alone in a room\
  \ so nobody can see you bump him off, the goal of SDL is to make sure that everyone\
  \ sees you perform the heroic deed of saving an old man from a sinking ship. It\
  \ features a game board that gets smaller as the ship slips under.</p>\n       \
  \      <p>At the 2010 ENnie Awards, Paizo won 11 golds and 1 silver. The awards\

  \ was having in 2010, it felt like we were living charmed lives. That all came crashing\
  \ down in October when we lost Dave Erickson. At 63, Dave was our oldest employee.\
  \ He joined the Paizo team in 2002, not even a year after we started, and took over\
  \ the finance department, freeing me to focus my efforts on making the company more\
  \ profitable and keeping it alive. Dave and I worked side by side on Paizo's finances.\
  \ Dave designed reports that allowed Erik, Vic, Jeff and myself to analyze what\
  \ was working well and what wasn't—insights that were invaluable to a small, struggling\
  \ company like Paizo. Dave also wasn't afraid to sit down face to face with government\
  \ auditors, each time sending them away with money due in Paizo's favor. He was\
  \ a loyal and honest man, and someone I trusted implicitly.</p>\n             <p>The\
  \ call came on the Tuesday after the Columbus Day weekend. I was refreshed from\
  \ the long weekend and ready to tackle whatever came. I wasn't prepared for that\
  \ call, though. Through tears, Dave's wife, Olga, let me know that Dave had passed\
  \ away in his sleep during the weekend. I was crushed. Devastated. Dave had just\
  \ started to plan his retirement, intending to spend his golden years with his wife.\
  \ Now he was gone, just like that. Dave's death showed us all how fragile life could\
  \ actually be.</p>\n             <p>A company Paizo's size doesn't have a ton of\
  \ redundancies, but thankfully, I had hired Chris Self in 2008 with the idea that\
  \ he would take over Finance in a few years when Dave retired. I had sent Chris\
  \ to start accounting school just months before Dave passed, and he'd worked with\
  \ Dave enough to fairly seamlessly take over the department a couple years ahead\
  \ of schedule.</p>\n             <p>Here's my favorite Dave Erickson story: During\
  \ Dave's first few months at Paizo, I quickly learned that if there was a discrepancy\
  \ between what <em>I</em> thought the numbers should be and what <em>Dave</em> thought\
  \ they should be, Dave was almost always right. Well, on one occasion, I finally\
  \ figured out that I was right for once, and I burst into Dave's office, brandishing\
  \ a sheaf of paperwork with all my figures, shouting \"In your face, Erickson!\"\
  \ To say that he was surprised is an understatement.</p>\n             <p>Another\
  \ negative for 2010 was the ongoing \"edition war.\" The online arguing between\
  \ fans of D&amp;D 4th Edition and the Pathfinder RPG goes all the way back to our\
  \ announcement of the Pathfinder RPG, but it took on new fervor in 2010 as 4E floundered\
  \ a bit and Pathfinder challenged it in the marketplace. I need to make one thing\
  \ clear—Paizo never wanted anything to do with the edition war. We weren't trying\
  \ to take down D&amp;D ; we were just trying to make a game that we enjoyed and\
  \ that allowed us to tell the stories that we wanted to tell. I would be lying if\
  \ I said we didn't enjoy the passion and loyalty of our customers defending their\
  \ game—it was very flattering... but we really hoped that the edition war would\
  \ just go away so everyone could enjoy their favorite game without attacking the\
  \ other.</p>\n             <p>This will be news to most readers: By the end of 2010,\
  \ the Pathfinder RPG had already overtaken D&amp;D as the bestselling RPG. It would\
  \ take almost half a year before industry magazine ICv2 first reported it, and several\
  \ quarters more before some people were willing to accept it as fact, but internally,\
  \ we already knew it was true. We'd heard it from nearly all of our hobby trade\
  \ distributors; we'd heard it from buyers at book chains like Barnes &amp; Noble\
  \ and Borders; we could see it using industry sales trackers such as BookScan; we\
  \ were even regularly coming out on top on Amazon's bestseller charts. Each individual\
  \ market we sold in had us either tied with or outselling D&amp;D, and none of those\
  \ sources counted our considerable direct sales on paizo.com. Put all of those things\
  \ together, and it was clear: Pathfinder had become the first RPG ever to oust D&amp;D\
  \ from top spot. It wasn't our goal, but here we were. And as we started planning\
  \ for 2011, we knew that if we were going to be the industry leader, we were going\
  \ to have to step up our game and act like a leader. 2011 would be our first chance\
  \ to show what we could do with that position....</p>\n             <p><b>Employees\

  \             <p>My relationship with Paizo began in 2007, when I subscribed to\
  \ <em>Dungeon</em> one issue before the announcement that the magazines were going\
  \ away. I basically wrote the timing off as bad luck, and decided to try to make\
  \ the most out of the few issues I'd get before the end. I opted for the Pathfinder\
  \ subscription instead of credit, primarily because I'd planned on mining <em>Dungeon</em>\
  \ for ideas for a homebrew campaign and figured I could mine this new Golarion world\
  \ for ideas too. In August 2007, I got my first issue of Pathfinder, glanced through\
  \ it, and filed it on the shelf because I didn't think any of it would be useful\
  \ for the campaign I was running at the time. I did the same for the next few issues.\
  \ In the fall, I joined a group playing the Savage Tide Adventure Path, and my mind\
  \ was no longer in GM space. But my involvement in this Adventure Path made me much\
  \ more aware of Paizo as a company, and of the quality of work the editors on <em>Dungeon</em>\
  \ (and likely, I assumed, Pathfinder) put out. So I started lurking on the messageboards\
  \ and reading the Pathfinder books I'd been getting, but I still wasn't sold. Fourth\
  \ Edition had been announced, and I was playtesting that with some of my friends\
  \ who'd freelanced for Wizards of the Coast in the past. I was hyped for the new\
  \ edition, and because I was invested in my Savage Tide group, I was quickly learning\
  \ as much about the campaign's Greyhawk setting as I could. I didn't have time for\
  \ another campaign setting when I had 30+ years of canon to catch up on in the world\
  \ in which I was already playing.</p>\n             <p>Then the Pathfinder Roleplaying\
  \ Game announcement came out, and my gaming group was all abuzz about the waves\
  \ Paizo was making. I got the Alpha and started reading all those books I had on\
  \ my shelf. I was thoroughly hooked. Here was a chance for me to be on the ground\
  \ floor, not just of a new edition of the game that I was already familiar with,\
  \ but also of a campaign setting that was only a few months old. I don't know what\
  \ day it was, but I drank the Pathfinder Kool-Aid sometime shortly after the big\
  \ announcement. I made my <a href=\"/forums/dmtyzpqz?New-Group-Where-to-start#1\"\
  >first paizo.com messageboard post</a> on March 31, 2008, in which I said \"I am\
  \ getting ready to dive into Golarion myself.\" And did I ever follow through!</p>\n\

  \ trivia contest... again!\n             </div>\n             <p>Around that time\
  \ I joined a small group of folks working on the daunting task of cataloguing all\
  \ the information about the Pathfinder Chronicles campaign setting (as it was called\
  \ at the time). The PathfinderWiki was founded on <a href=\"/forums/dmtyzjp6?Pathfinder-Index#16\"\
  >March 8, 2008</a>, and I quickly joined up, and am often miscredited as being the\
  \ wiki's founder even today. My involvement in the project became something of a\
  \ full-time hobby, and the countless hours I spent adding and editing content on\
  \ there gave me a depth and breadth of knowledge about Golarion that rivaled even\
  \ Paizo employees. I attended PaizoCon 2009 and helped my team, Razmiran Faith Barge\
  \ Union #107, win the annual trivia contest, in no small part because of the work\
  \ I'd done on the wiki.</p>\n             <p>At Gen Con a few months later, I approached\
  \ Sean, Wes, and Josh independently and asked if I could write for Paizo, as I felt\
  \ I'd displayed my knowledge of the setting and had a whole website of material\
  \ I'd written about the world to show my writing talents. A few weeks later, I was\
  \ working on a portion of Gnomes of Golarion, most of the Kingmaker Player's Guide,\
  \ and a Pathfinder Society Scenario, all of which couldn't have come at a better\
  \ time for a recently unemployed filmmaker. Once the freelancing started, it didn't\
  \ seem to end as long as I met my deadlines, turned in my best work, and kept asking\
  \ the folks at Paizo for more. A few weeks before PaizoCon 2010, I got an unexpected\
  \ call from Erik (incidentally, while I was exploring Delvehaven as a player in\
  \ a friend's Council of Thieves campaign). He asked if I was coming to PaizoCon\
  \ (duh!) and if I had plans afterward (I didn't). I soon did, however, as he offered\
  \ me a contract to work in the Paizo offices for a week following the con helping\
  \ build the Inner Sea Poster Map Folio. I detailed my brief time as a Paizo employee\
  \ in a <a href=\"/paizo/blog/2010/june/v5748dyo5lb7s\">guest blog</a> at the time.</p>\n\
  \             <p>What that blog doesn't tell you, however, is that on the last day\
  \ of the contract, Lisa, James, and Erik pulled me into Lisa's office to talk about\
  \ how I felt the experience had been, how I liked working with the rest of the editorial\
  \ team, and ultimately what I thought about working for Paizo full time. I thought\
  \ hard about my response for about 3 seconds before accepting the offer. It took\
  \ me another two months to get myself moved from New York City to Seattle, but once\
  \ I started, it wasn't long before I was in charge of development of two product\
  \ lines and making a sizable contribution to the very world continuity whose chronicling\
  \ caught Paizo's eye in the first place. Now, two years later, I'm still amazed\
  \ on a weekly basis that this is my real-life job, and that I get to work for such\
  \ a great company and with such a fun and inspiring group of coworkers. It's a lot\
  \ of work, for sure, but I can't think of anything I'd rather be doing instead.</p>\n\

  \             <h2>\"Who are these people, and what are they doing to my magazines?!\"\
  </h2>\n             <p>Yeah, that was my first thought when I saw somebody else's\
  \ logo plastered on the credits of my two favorite gaming magazines. I had just\
  \ recently gotten back into gaming after a post–high school hiatus and life settled\
  \ into a 9 to 5 routine. Lured in by the release of Third Edition and the Oriental\
  \ Adventures supplement (and new dice, because new game = new dice), I immediately\
  \ said to myself, \"So what kind of adventures are out there for this system?\"\
  </p>\n             <p>High on the creative spark that often comes with a new game\
  \ system, and yearning to see what other people had come up with, I picked up <em>Dragon</em>\
  \ 288 and <em>Dungeon</em> 84 from Gambit Games in Bend, Oregon—I miss that place!—\
  and was blown away by what was between its slick, glossy covers. Clearly, these\
  \ were not the black-and-white productions of my youth, but for all of its sweet,\
  \ candy-colored coating, did it satisfy?</p>\n             <p>I need not have worried.\
  \ Month after month, I begged the store owner to stock these magazines to feed my\
  \ habit—er, game mastering creativity. Somehow, the minds behind the magazine knew\
  \ exactly what I was looking for in my game, knew that I needed it now (hungered\
  \ for it, even), and I knew that I would gladly fork over the cash to keep quality\
  \ game material coming. Yet I didn't venture on to the place that would become like\
  \ a second home to me until almost four years later, during a period of idleness\
  \ at work (you know you're doing that... <em>right now</em>). I found a messageboard\
  \ community of like-minded gamers who had been playing long enough to know what\
  \ chits were, who remembered when elves were a class, who knew the difference between\
  \ githyanki and githzerai, and who were passionate about the game.</p>\n       \
  \      <p>Did I mention that some of these were the writers, as well as the staff—\
  the people who had made the magazine that helped lure me back into running a game\
  \ three nights a week, arming me with a crowbar to pry open and shove in awesome\
  \ gaming material like new alchemical items, chronomancy, and ghost elves into my\
  \ campaign?</p>\n             <p>Through the Paizo messageboards, I met the staff,\
  \ as well as a group of writers who gave me my first writing job (hello GM Gems),\
  \ but there are a few things that could not have happened without talking and meeting\
  \ people through the boards, and these are things that have not gone quietly into\
  \ the night. They've managed to stick around for a bit, and I'm happy to say I've\
  \ had my fingers in them, even if it was just the teeniest bit of my pinky finger.</p>\n\
  \             <p>First up: PaizoCon. (You may have heard of it.) Tim Nightengale\
  \ bore the brunt of organizing the first unofficial PaizoCon, but even then, we\
  \ referred to each other as Fellow Dictators as we plotted and planned ways to give\
  \ thanks to the hardworking Paizo staff. (The fan award that I whipped up still\
  \ hangs in the office today.) Second: the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook!\
  \ Wes Schneider contacted me and a few other folks (Tim Connors, Adam Daigle, and\
  \ Greg Oppedisano) to do some quick formatting alterations for magic items and spells.\
  \ (My first \"real\" Paizo writing credit came later in \"Infestation,\" the side\
  \ trek adventure in <a href=\"products/btpy86v1?Pathfinder-18-Second-Darkness-Chapter-6-Descent-into-Midnight\"\
  >Pathfinder 18</a>.) Finally, the one that I am the most proud of to this day: the\
  \ creation of the fan-created and fan-run Wayfinder magazine. When Paizo announced\
  \ their <a href=\"paizo/about/communityuse\">Community Use Policy</a>, I knew that\
  \ I had to do something with it. Wayfinder is that thing, and it remains such a\
  \ great way to get your toes wet into the world of roleplaying game publishing—\
  and you get to play in the Golarion sandbox!</p>\n             <p>Skeptic, fan,\
  \ superfan (yup, charter superscriber and all), freelancer, friend, and finally,\
  \ employee, my relationship with Paizo ended up being the culmination of a lot of\
  \ hobbies and interests all rolled up into a golem-shaped package. That step between\
  \ \"friend\" and \"employee\" had a moment of \"Am I going to fit in here?\" though,\
  \ that same sort of nervousness that you got on the first day of a new school. They\
  \ knew my name, they knew my penchant for offloading my home-baked cookies at their\
  \ offices pre-PaizoCon, but... still.</p>\n             <p>I was a fool for even\
  \ worrying about it. After quietly starting in Customer Service, I got Cosmo's \"\
  you are the meat shield\" introduction and was able to skip over all of the tedious\
  \ \"learn about the company's products\" portion of a customer service job. (I believe\
  \ Cosmo said something to the effect of \"Well, this makes it a lot easier.\") The\
  \ moment that made me ask myself why I didn't do this sooner is when I was delivering\
  \ the mail downstairs and Jason Bulmahn asked \"...Do you work here now?\"</p>\n\
  \             <p>The best way that I can describe working at Paizo is this: imagine\
  \ all of your high school friends in one place, with the same overlapping interests,\
  \ whether it's early Minoan art, the latest Studio Ghibli movie, the pros and cons\
  \ of the latest sci-fi movie, or tapping into the depths of cryptozoology among\
  \ the editorial staff. Really, it's not so much of who's a geek or not—because we\
  \ all are here—it's a matter of degree.</p>\n             <p>And I wouldn't have\
  \ it any other way.</p>\n             <p>Liz Courts<br>\n               Webstore\
  \ Specialist</p>\n             <h2>Weighing Dragons</h2>\n             <p>I came\
  \ to work at Paizo by chance. My previous editorial experience was mostly in textbook\
  \ development, but when the economy—and textbook industry—crashed, I moved to Seattle\
  \ and started retraining in technical editing while freelancing to pay the bills.\
  \ In December 2009, I was visiting my family in Wisconsin, fending off unsubtle\
  \ suggestions to consider engineering as a more stable career path, when I got word\
  \ through the gchat grapevine that Paizo was looking for an editor who was familiar\
  \ with RPGs. Hello, me! Suddenly all of those years spent gaming from junior high\
  \ through college and into grad school were a job qualification; I quickly added\
  \ the dozen or so games I'd played to my resume and sent it off.</p>\n         \
  \    <p>A few days later I had a phone interview with Erik and Wes—as it turns out,\
  \ there are wrong answers to the question \"What was the last fantasy book you read?\"\
  , but not being a <em>Twilight</em> fan, I cleared that hurdle, among others. Then\
  \ on New Year's Eve, I submitted an editing test. Because Seattle is a very small\
  \ world, I bumped into Sutter at a party later that night. He gave me reason for\
  \ cautious optimism, giving my new year a promising start!</p>\n             <p>Ten\
  \ days later I started at Paizo as a contract editor. Wes, Chris, and Sutter handed\
  \ me the style guide (a mere 40 pages long at the time), then threw me into the\
  \ deep end with a pass on the <em>GameMastery Guide</em> and the second half of\
  \ the Season 1 Pathfinder Society Scenarios. It was already the Gen Con crunch,\
  \ and the pace was hectic—and then after work I'd dash to my technical editing classes\
  \ to dissect software tutorials, nuclear accident reports, and medical device instructions\
  \ (I know WAY more than I want to about femur traction splints). Needless to say,\
  \ I didn't have a lot of free time for reflection. But one day while chatting with\
  \ my classmates about our respective jobs and internships, I mentioned that I'd\
  \ fact-checked the weight of a dragon that day. Jaws dropped. Their reactions confirmed\
  \ my suspicion that this was definitely the most fun editing around! I wanted so\
  \ badly to stay on—I threw myself into my work, offered to take on more when I could,\
  \ and even moderated my hard-line stance on commas to better match Paizo's style.</p>\n\
  \             <p>A couple months later when my contract ended, I was offered a full-time\
  \ position, and was so elated! It's been over 2 years now, with some stressful times\
  \ along the way, but despite the fact that my wonderful coworkers seem to think\
  \ it's a personal challenge to slip details into adventures that make me go fetal\
  \ with horror, I love my job more than ever.</p>\n             <p>And you know what?\
  \ My dad, who'd subscribed to <em>Dragon</em> since I was a toddler, is <em>finally</em>\
  \ off my back about engineering!</p>\n             <p>Judy Bauer<br><em>Editor</em></p>\n\
