  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, July 1, 2008</p> \n   <p>Yes, you read that correctly.\
  \ Ferretfolk.</p> \n   <p>Under the auspices of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Gary Gygax\
  \ created a number of iconic races, whether out of whole cloth or by combining a\
  \ various different mythological and literary sources. So I guess I shouldn't have\
  \ been surprised when, in his final novel, he did it one last time. At first, I\
  \ balked—up to this point, <i><a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy80hs\">Infernal\
  \ Sorceress</a></i> had been a fairly hard-edged and gritty fantasy romp. What were\
  \ a bunch of talking weasel-people doing here? Yet once I got past my initial knee-jerk\
  \ reaction (which said that such things were better off left in one of Brian Jacques's\
  \ <i>Redwall</i> novels), I realized that, in fact, they fit the story perfectly.\
  \ After all, what's the point of fantasy if not to mix things up and make the reader\
  \ question their standard assumptions? In throwing in something totally out of left\
  \ field, Gygax was rattling my cage and reminding me that there's more to the genre\
  \ than just the same old white-bread elves and dwarves we all know and love. And\
  \ besides, their accents are totally adorable. </p>\n   <p>So with that said, I\
  \ thought I'd offer you all the first (and quite possibly last) appearance of the\
  \ ferretfolk:</p> \n   <blockquote> \n    <p>Below, Ferret stared a second in horror.\
  \ What little light there was danced and swayed wildly, but it was sufficient to\
  \ show him the ugly mandibles and head of the steelback as the monster came up into\
  \ the cave. The hole's exit was a tight fit for it, but the myriapod was forcing\
  \ its hard body through it all too quickly. Each segment through gave it two more\
  \ legs with which to haul the rest of it out to get at its prey. \"Oh, crap! Now\
  \ what?\" Ferret cursed as he turned to look for a really fast means of getting\
  \ up to the passage he wasn't sure would save them from the hunting giant centipede.\
  \ At that moment a braided leather rope dropped in front of him. Ferret needed no\
  \ urging, and he swarmed up hand-over-hand. \"Where'd you get the rope, Ra—\"</p>\
  \ \n    <p>His jaw fell slack as he saw the welcoming committee awaiting him. One\
  \ of that number jerked him all the way inside, pulled him out of the way, as two\
  \ others rolled a rounded boulder to the brink of the tunnel. \"—ker? </p> \n  \
  \  <p>His companion was as shocked as Ferret. Raker gave his head a slight shake\
  \ as if to say, \"I haven't the slightest notion,\" and then stared at the two lithe\
  \ forms which were just in the process of shoving the big stone over the edge. They\
  \ heard a thump and a sharp crack followed by scrabbling noises which slowly died\
  \ away. </p> \n    <p> \"Gottum!\" One of the creatures who had sent the boulder\
  \ down chittered in something which sounded vaguely like human speech as it turned\
  \ and showed a mouthful of sharp fangs to the two men. </p> \n    <p> \"That's trade\
  \ talk,\" Raker murmured, referring to the pidgin Phonecian commonly used throughout\
  \ much of Ærth to conduct business. </p> \n    <p> \"And that's a... a... man-sized\
  \ stoat,\" Ferret breathed. </p> \n    <p> \"Sure, talk pretty fine with hewmuns\
  \ allatime now and then, but no Stoatie. Nonono. Thurr we are—Ferretfolk you name\
  \ we, us say Thurr.\" The creature trilled the r's as it pronounced the name of\
  \ its folk. \"See dead manyfoot?\" </p> \n    <p>The creature talked as fast as\
  \ it moved. Ferret couldn't believe this. They did look like huge, slender ferrets,\
  \ down to their buff fur and black \"masks.\" He gaped, then asked rather stupidly,\
  \ \"Real ferretfolk?\" He had heard of them but never believed they existed. \"\
  I am called Ferret.\" </p> \n    <p>The one who had hauled him to safety ignored\
  \ the question. \"Come. See it broken. Good.\" </p> \n    <p>Both men went to where\
  \ the creature proudly pointed with its nose, stared down to see the steelback below,\
  \ forepart a gory ruin under the boulder. \"You sure squashed the shit out of that\
  \ head!\" Raker said with enthusiasm.</p> \n    <p> \"Bad thing, manyfoot. Kill\
  \ hewmuns, kill you, kill Thurr, too, so we allatime kill 'em first. Pretty good,\
  \ sure?\" And as it rattled that off the creature showed its teeth again in what\
  \ was surely meant to be an imitation of a human smile.</p> \n   </blockquote> \n\
