  \ the Secret of Dragonfall...\"</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, November 13,\
  \ 2007</p> \n   <p><i>\"Psst... you. Yeah, you! I've got a secret to tell ya. You\
  \ gotta keep this one quiet, though, because they'll kill ya if'n you know about\
  \ it. Who? Dragons, of course! \"Word is that when most dragons are close to death,\
  \ the make a pilgrimage to this place called Dragonfall, where their bones are laid\
  \ to rest with those of their kin, regardless of color or creed. There they wait,\
  \ for the gods only know what reason. This is no ordinary boneyard, though—oh no.\
  \ It's watched over by ferocious protectors who slay any who so much as lay eyes\
  \ on it. Rumor has it that most of these wyrms take all of the treasure with 'em\
  \ when they die, piling it up into one gigantic horde. That'd be enough scratch\
  \ for you and me to buy ourselves a crown or two, eh? Of course, I'm not sure I\
  \ can tell ya without getting a bit of coin in return. For my wife and kids you\
  \ see... this secret is about all we have. I think a thousand gold crowns should\
  \ be enough.\"</i> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—Conversation with a shifty beggar\
  \ in the alleys of Kaer Maga</p> \n   <p><a href=\"/store/v5748btpy7x87\">GameMastery\
  \ Module <i>J2: Guardians of Dragonfall</i></a> is due to release later this month.\
  \ We promise to let you have it for a little less than a thousand gold crowns...\
