  description\">It's been a long week of hard work and hard business travel (ok, fun\
  \ business travel), so at the end of the day here on Friday, the thing I'm most\
  \ looking forward to doing is heading home and hanging out with my dog. I got my\
  \ first pet—a wonderfully chubby pug named Tiny—about 5 years ago. Before that I\
  \ didn't really understand compassion. While I always (sort of) enjoyed hanging\
  \ out with my friends' dogs, I never knew why people liked them so much. Then I\
  \ got one of my own, my heart melted, and I guess you could say I'm a better man\
  \ than I ever was before.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\
  /image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160422-Tiny.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160422-Tiny_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>But the thing is, not all dogs are as awesome as my little\
  \ Tiny. Some of them are right bastards.</p> \n    <p>For this week's preview, we're\
  \ taking a look at two terrible canines from October's <a href=\"/products/btpy9kcu\"\
  ><em>Deadly Foes</em></a> set of <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder Battles</a>\
  \ prepainted plastic miniatures. Bring your pepper spray and choke chains, and most\
  \ importantly, BEWARE OF DOG!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\

  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Up first this week is the Cerberi, a nasty three-headed\
  \ dog from the pages of <em>Pathfinder RPG: Bestiary 3</em>. Based on the mythical\
  \ guard dogs of Hell, these outsiders can dimensionally anchor an enemy with a bite,\
  \ and their three noses are particularly good at sniffing out undead. Of course,\
  \ they're lawful evil, so they aren't so great with the living, either. The Cerberi\
  \ is a Medium, uncommon figure.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\

  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>Bad dogs travel best in packs, and when you're talking\
  \ about dogs from Hell like the Cerberi, you've got to also talk about the original\
  \ hounds of hell—hell hounds! This charming fellow is the Advanced Hell Hound, a\
  \ Large and more imposing version of the original creature (whom we included in\
  \ the <em>Shattered Star</em> set). I've included a side view, as the flames coming\
  \ out of this guy's mouth make it a little difficult to interpret from straight-on.\
  \ Either way, this guy is sure to light a fire under the feet of your player characters.\
  \ The Advanced Hell Hound is a Large, uncommon figure.</p> \n    <p>And that's it\
  \ for this week! Join us in seven days for another look ahead at the villains, heroes,\
  \ and monsters of <a href=\"/products/btpy9kcu\"><em>Deadly Foes</em></a>!</p> \n\
  \    <p>Until then, I remain...</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p>\
