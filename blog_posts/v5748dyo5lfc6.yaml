  \ itemprop=\"description\">October is looming nearer, and with it comes the promise\
  \ of new Paizo books that deal in the horrific, the supernatural, and the downright\
  \ creepy. Chief among our offerings this year is a book I am very much excited for—\
  the much-anticipated <a href=\"/products/btpy91dq\"><i>Pathfinder Player Companion:\
  \ Blood of the Moon</i></a>! This spiritual sequel to last year's <a href=\"/products/btpy8v33\"\
  ><i>Blood of the Night</i></a> contains everything players need to know about werecreatures\
  \ and their distant descendants, the skinwalkers, including rules for this all-new\
  \ race of lycanthrope-kin and dozens of new mechanics to complement bestial adventurers\
  \ of any race or path. Whether your skinwalker heritage emerged amid an assuming\
  \ rural village or you were a human raised by wolves to become an animalistic barbarian,\
  \ <i>Blood of the Moon</i> provides infinite inspiration and options for characters\
  \ who have more than a tinge of the wild side running in their blood.</span></p>\
  \ \n    <p>Anyway, it's probably about time we spilled some of the beans on this\
  \ book. In no particular order, here are some of my favorite parts of <i>Blood of\
  \ the Moon</i>.</p> \n    <ul>\n     <li><b>Bestial Powers for All:</b> While a\
  \ lot of the focus of this book is on skinwalkers, there's also no shortage of new\
  \ info and new character options for players of any race or background as long as\
  \ they have a flair for savagery and are willing to embrace the animal within.</li>\
  \ \n     <li><b>Eight Faces of Lycanthropy:</b> Since skinwalkers can be descended\
  \ from any type of lycanthrope—including familiar beasts such as werewolves, wererats,\
  \ and werebears, as well as Golarion's more unusual werecreatures like weretigers\
  \ and werecrocodiles—it made sense to include details and rules for each of these\
  \ distinct lycanthrope races and their half-blooded brood. Whether you're playing\
  \ a skinwalker, a natural or afflicted lycanthrope, a hunter of these creatures,\
  \ or an adventurer who simply has a tendency for nocturnal bloodshed, each of the\
  \ eight facets of lycanthropy presented in this book give characters of all walks\
  \ ample opportunity to hone their deadly skills toward a path that best represents\
  \ their tactics and personality.</li> \n     <li><b>La Luna:</b> No book on lycanthropes\
  \ and their kin would be complete without an examination of these creatures' special\
  \ relationship with the moon. In addition to exploring the mystical connection between\
  \ lycanthropes and the moon, Blood of the Moon features the new lunar oracle mystery\
  \ and even suggestions for how to play with lycanthropes on worlds with multiple\
  \ moons (such as some of the planets in Golarion's own solar system).</li>\n   \
  \ </ul> \n    <p>Of course, there's much, much more in <i>Blood of the Moon</i>\
  \ than the tidbits I've hinted at. In addition to explorations on skinwalkers' status\
  \ in Golarion, in-world accounts of these creatures and their lycanthropic forebears,\
  \ and a thorough analysis of lycanthropic infection and the process of transformation,\
  \ this Player Companion features tons of new rules crunch, including new magic items,\
  \ spells, feats, magus arcana, and witch hexes, to name just a few.</p> \n    <p>This\
  \ was a very exciting Player Companion to develop, and I'm stoked to see what readers\
  \ think of this no-holds-barred volume on all things lycanthrope. Take off the collar\
  \ and get ready to unleash the beast within, because <a href=\"/products/btpy91dq\"\
  ><i>Blood of the Moon</i></a> hits shelves next month!</p> \n    <p>Patrick Renie<br>\
