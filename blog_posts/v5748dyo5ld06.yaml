  \ \n    <p class=\"date\">Thursday, January 12, 2012</p> \n    <p>As the four judges\
  \ whittle down the RPG Superstar wondrous item “keeps” pile from about 60 to just\
  \ 32 + 4 alternates, I thought we could take some time to hear from two of our guest\
  \ judges for Round 1—Sean McGowan and Jerral Toi, who made it to the Top 4 last\
  \ year. Take it away, gentlemen!</p> \n    <p>Sean K Reynolds<br> <i>Designer and\
  \ RPG Superstar Judge</i></p> \n    <p></p>\n    <center>\n     ∗∗∗\n    </center>\n\

  \ style=\"padding-right: 1em; float: left;\"> \n    <p>RPG Superstar has, over the\
  \ past few years, become as much a part of my holiday season as any family traditions\
  \ I may have grown up with. It’s just not a proper winter wonderland ’til there’\
  s a big, pretty link to the Superstar forums on the left side of the Paizo page.\
  \ (Plus, it serves as a reminder that I need to start getting some shopping done.)</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Paizo has created a great annual event with this contest, and much like\
  \ the Macy’s parade or the New Year’s Eve ball drop, I hope it never goes away,\
  \ but just stretches on into the future leaving an infinite number of superstar\
  \ winners in its wake. Leaving aside the fun factor (and that’s a lot to leave aside...)\
  \ it’s a great experience to just be able to see new RPG writers developing. </p>\
  \ \n    <p>The first two years of the contest, I had a blast just being a spectator\
  \ and kibitzing from the sidelines. The next two years I was lucky enough to make\
  \ it in as a contestant. As one of the Top 4, I was thrilled at getting the chance\
  \ to write a Pathfinder Society Scenario for Paizo, and loved the experience. This\
  \ year, I’m enjoying the role of guest judge for Round 1. I’m very much looking\
  \ forward to participating in the contest in this new fashion, not least because\
  \ I’m a deeply impatient person and getting to see the Round 1 entries a week before\
  \ they’re public is awesome.</p> \n    <p>Sean McGowan<br> <i>RPG Superstar Guest\
  \ Judge</i></p> \n    <p></p>\n    <center>\n     ∗∗∗\n    </center>\n    <p></p>\
  \ \n    <img src=\"/image/content/RPGSuperstar/JerallToi_90.jpeg\" style=\"padding-right:\
  \ 1em; float: left;\"> \n    <p>2011 was a crazy year. The RPG Superstar contest\
  \ was one of the most stressful, yet fun and exciting times of my gaming history.\
  \ In the end, I placed in the Top 4 and was given the opportunity to start edging\
  \ my way into game design freelancing. In addition to working with Mark Moreland\
  \ on <a href=\"/products/btpy8n0o\"><i>Pathfinder Society Scenario #3–09: The Quest\
  \ for Perfection—Part I: The Edge of Heaven</i></a>, I also infiltrated the kobold\
  \ mines and snuck an article featuring alchemist archetypes into <a href=\"/products/btpy8p2g\"\
  >Kobold Quarterly 19</a>. Right now, I am working on a series of steampunk-themed\
  \ projects for <a href=\"/store/byCompany/n/nevermetPress\">Nevermet Press</a>.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Publication, however, is only one of the many good things to emerge from\
  \ competing. The contest forced me to reexamine several previously engrained thoughts\
  \ and habits pertaining to writing and gaming. During the contest, the judges and\
  \ broader audience shared a lot of information and advice about gaming, writing,\
  \ and the RPG industry, as well as personalized and individual feedback. Where else\
  \ can you get good and immediately applicable advice like this? </p> \n    <p>I\
  \ am looking forward to learning even more in 2012.</p> \n    <p>Jerral Toi<br>\
