  \ at Rise of the Runelords</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Friday, February 03, 2012</p>\
  \ \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    <a href=\"/store/byCompany/w/wizKids/featuredBrands/pathfinderMiniatures/v5748btpy8o6b\"\

  \   </div> \n   <p><a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ld20\">Last week</a> I previewed\
  \ several miniatures from our upcoming Rise of the Runelords Pathfinder Battles\
  \ prepainted miniature set, scheduled for an early summer release. WizKids is still\
  \ finalizing the details on the product mix and exact release date, so while we\
  \ do not yet have a product page for the set, I DO have some more really cool images\
  \ to show you of paint masters!</p> \n   <p>To recap, a “paint master” is an early\
  \ output of the miniature painted as a guide to the factory artists who will paint\
  \ the final production run. So far, we’ve been really impressed with the factory’\
  s ability to match the quality of our paint masters, so we’re pushing things a bit\
  \ with this latest release to ensure that you receive the highest possible quality\
  \ miniatures we can deliver.</p> \n   <p>So these images don’t look exactly like\
  \ the final minis will look, but this is what they’re shooting for, and I suspect\
  \ the final product will be very close to what you see here.</p> \n   <p>These miniatures\
  \ support the <a href=\"/products/btpy8mqq\">Rise of the Runelords Anniversary Edition</a>,\
  \ a massive hardcover collection of our very first Adventure Path that we’re releasing\
  \ this summer as a special 10th Anniversary present to ourselves (and to you!).</p>\
  \ \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/020312-Ghoul_360.jpeg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/020312-Ghoul_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n   </div>\
  \ \n   <p>Up first this week is the Ghoul, a common miniature that represents a\
  \ key enemy in the Adventure Path’s second installment. I’ve always been fond of\
  \ ghouls as deadly undead menaces for low-level parties, and this guy looks great,\
  \ nasty long tongue and all! (And no, his left arm isn’t quite so straight in real\
  \ life.)</p> \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/020312-DenizenofLeng_360.jpeg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/020312-DenizenofLeng_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\
  \   </div> \n   <p>If you thought ghouls were terrifying, wait until you get a load\
  \ of the Denizen of Leng, another common who will come in handy as your players\
  \ reach the second half of the Adventure Path. Drawn to the world from an otherworldly\
  \ plateau and possessed of weird eldritch powers, this alien mystic subs in nicely\
  \ for any kid of oddball spellcaster eager to keep his ugly mug hidden behind soiled\
  \ linen strips.</p> \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/020312-Wraith_360.jpeg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/020312-Wraith_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n   </div>\
  \ \n   <p>This miniature, the uncommon Wraith, is a good example of something new\
  \ we’re trying with this set—clear plastic! When appropriate (as in the case of\
  \ incorporeal undead), we plan to produce certain miniatures in this set with a\
  \ translucent plastic, adding to the otherworldly effect. This figure is an almost\
  \ direct translation of the wraith illustration from the <a href=\"/products/btpy8auu\"\
  >Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</a>, but it took us several tries to get a workable sculpt\
  \ from the waist down, as the original art is not particularly helpful in this regard.\
  \ I’m really happy with how he turned out.</p> \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n\
  \    <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/020312-Scanderig_360.jpeg\"><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/020312-Scanderig_180.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n   </div> \n   <p>Last up today is another clear plastic miniature,\
  \ the relentless Scanderig (or Forgefiend). This original creature made his first\
  \ appearance in the original Rise of the Runelords campaign, and countless player\
  \ characters have since been stuffed inside its fiery belly. He is both Large and\
  \ rare, and in person he looks absolutely amazing. Note the painted “bars” on the\
  \ back of the mini. The original illustration didn’t show the creature’s back, so\
  \ our master painter added the lines with paint to create a sort of grill effect.\
  \ We didn’t so much care for that, so the final miniature will have an “open” front\
  \ and back, which ought to help light shine through the red plastic, enhancing the\
  \ fire effect.</p> \n   <p>One of the cool things about this second set of Pathfinder\
  \ Battles miniatures, for us here at Paizo, is to see original Pathfinder creatures\
  \ in plastic. The Scanderig is just one of many in the Rise of the Runelords set,\
  \ but the others will have to wait for future Fridays, and future Pathfinder Battles\
  \ previews.</p> \n   <p>Until then,</p> \n   <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p>\
