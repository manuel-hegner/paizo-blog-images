  \  <blockquote> \n   <h1><br>A river, a river, my kingdom for a river!</h1> \n \
  \  <p class=\"date\">Wednesday, November 18, 2009</p> \n   <p>It's been just over\
  \ a fortnight since I risked life and limb to infiltrate the stygian depths of Paizo's\
  \ editorial pit, so I thought it was time to provide a few brief glimpses into the\
  \ shadowy machinations of Paizo's editorial process.</p> \n   <p>As soon as Paizo's\
  \ minions discovered my presence, they lost no time in hurling reams of word-filled\
  \ paper at me. Armed only with a quill and a pot of green ink, I got right to work,\
  \ slashing hanging participles and eradicating the feared passive voice. Along the\
  \ way, I realized I was working on a <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy87d8\">comprehensive\
  \ guide to realms of a most low character</a>. While it was my great pleasure to\
  \ read and edit a plethora of famed authors' impressions of such a dangerous and\
  \ unstable land, I soon learned that mapping such a chaotic territory and compiling\
  \ its history into a concise timeline were Herculean tasks of epic proportions.\
  \ Nevertheless, I persevered, so that you, loyal readers, would get only the best.</p>\n\
  \   <p> </p>\n   <p>But these riverine dominions were not my only task, for <a href=\"\
  /pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8daf\">two new classes</a> were ready to take their place\
  \ in an upcoming <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8b6g\">guide to advanced play</a>\
  \ and needed a critical editorial eye before making their playtest debut before\
  \ the eager masses. I was only too happy to give the oracle and cavalier my aid,\
  \ and send them happily on their way.</p>\n   <p> </p>\n   <p>As for what comes\
  \ next, your guess is as good mine! I am hoarding a few secrets, of course (I've\
  \ been sworn to secrecy on the threat of Death by a Thousand Paper Cuts regarding\
  \ the happenings at last week's secret Sandpoint game, for example), but more tidbits\
  \ will slowly be making their laborious way to bloglight, I can assure you. Until\
  \ then, I bid you fond farewell. And watch out for the fish!</p>\n   <p> </p>\n\
